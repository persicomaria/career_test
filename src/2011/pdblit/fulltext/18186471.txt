ABSTRACT The outer membrane lipoprotein A (OmlA) belongs to a family of bacterial small lipoproteins widely distributed across the beta and gamma proteobacteria. Although the role of numerous bacterial lipoproteins is known, the biological function of OmlA remains elusive. We found that in the citrus canker pathogen, Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (X. citri), OmlA is coregulated with the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) and their expression is enhanced when X. citri is grown on citrus leaves, suggesting that these proteins are involved in plant-pathogen interaction. To gain insights into the function of OmlA, its conformational and dynamic features were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance. The protein has highly flexible N- and C- termini and a structurally well defined core composed of three bstrands and two small a-helices, which pack against each other forming a two-layer alpha/beta scaffold. This protein fold resembles the domains of the b-lactamase inhibitory protein BLIP, involved in protein­protein binding. In conclusion, the structure of OmlA does suggest that this protein may be implicated in protein­protein interactions required during X. citri infection.

INTRODUCTION Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (X. citri) is the bacterial pathogen responsible for the citrus canker disease, which affects all citrus varieties worldwide. The disease is characterized by an intense growth and division of the host cells leading to pustule-like lesions on the surface of leaves, stems and fruits.1 Although some studies have shown that translocation of X. citri effector proteins into the host cell is required for plant cell hypertrophy2, the role of X. citri membrane lipoproteins in canker development and bacterial survival in the host is not known. Bacterial lipoproteins represent a large group of specialized membrane proteins that perform a variety of functions including maintenance and stabilization of the cell envelope,3,4 protein targeting and transit to the outer membrane,5,6 membrane biogenesis,7 and cell adherence.8 The principal feature of bacterial lipoproteins is the presence of a predominantly hydrophobic signal peptide located at the N-terminus.9­11 Cleavage of the signal peptide occurs at a conserved cysteine residue required for the covalent binding to a lipid, a step necessary to anchor the protein to the membrane.9,12 Though a number of lipid-modified outer membrane proteins have been functionally13,14 and structurally15­19 studied, a group of small lipoproteins belonging to the SmpA/OmlA family remains largely uncharacterized. Members of this family have recently been shown to be involved in the assembly of outer membrane proteins and to be necessary for preserving the structural integrity of the cell envelope.20 For instance, an omlA mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa turned out to be hyper-susceptible to detergents and antibiotics,21 whereas in Pseudomonas putida,

OmlA was essential to provide protection against benzoic acid,22 a plant defense molecule that accumulates during pathogen attack.23,24 In none of these cases, however, the precise mechanism of action of OmlA has been determined. Interestingly, in several gram-negative bacteria, the omlA gene has been found adjacent to the gene that encodes the ferric uptake regulator Fur,21,25 the principal regulatory protein of iron homeostasis and stress response in bacteria.26­28 Nonetheless, though omlA and fur are divergently transcribed from an overlapping bidirectional promoter,21,25 a fact that would suggest some functional correlation, a possible link between Fur-dependent responses and OmlA function has not been found so far. Here, we show that OmlA and Fur are coregulated and their expression is particularly enhanced when X. citri is grown on citrus leaves. We also report the solution structure of OmlA; the first one of a member of this protein family. While the structure does not unveil any association with iron homeostasis, it is consistent with the hypothesis that OmlA may be involved in protein­protein interactions, as recently shown to be the case for the E. coli OmlA homolog.20

a Hi-Trap SP Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 25 mM NaCl. OmlA was eluted with a 0­1M NaCl gradient and subjected to a final Ni-affinity purification step. The protein was dialyzed against 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8 and concentrated with Centricon (Millipore) filters. The purity of OmlA was estimated to be >98% by SDS-PAGE. For isotopic labelling of OmlA, the protein was expressed and purified as described.32
Antiserum production and western blot

Purified OmlA without the 6xHis tag was used to immunize white rabbits according to standard procedures.31 Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto PVDF (Millipore) membranes, which were incubated with the anti-OmlA at 1:5000 dilution at room temperature for 1 h, and subsequently washed with TBS.29 Membranes were incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit IgG-peroxidase conjugate and developed with the ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences).
Reporter gene constructs and expression analysis

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial growth conditions

E. coli cells were grown in LB medium,29 under agitation (200 rpm) at 308C with the appropriate antibiotics, whereas X. citri, strain 306,30 was grown in LB medium without NaCl (LBON), supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg/L) at 288C with shaking (200 rpm).
Cloning, expression, and purification of X. citri OmlA

The gene encoding the OmlA (NP_641849) was amplified from CTAB-extracted29 genomic DNA with forward (50 -CATATGCGTAATCTCCTGCTG-30 ) and reverse (50 CTCGAGTCAACGGCCGCGTTG-30 ) primers. PCR products were cloned into pGemT (Promega), sequenced and subcloned into the NdeI/XhoI sites of pET28a (Novagen) for the expression of OmlA with a six-histidine tag at the N-terminal. E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysE cells transformed with the pET-omlA plasmid were grown at 308C under agitation and the protein was expressed by addition of 0.4 mM IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside) after the optical density of the culture reached 0.6 at 600 nm. After 3 h of induction, cells were disrupted by sonication and the protein was purified by standard Ni-affinity chromatography. After elution in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM NaCl and 120 mM imidazol, OmlA was cleaved overnight with thrombin in the presence of 2.5 mM CaCl231 at 258C and further purified in

The bidirectional omlA/fur promoter was cloned in both orientations to drive the expression of an EGFP reporter gene. The omlA promoter was amplified with primers 50 -CCATGGGGGATTAAGTGCTG-30 and 50 -GGG CCCGCACGCGGTAGACC-30 to obtain a DNA fragment encompassing the entire intergenic region plus 170 bp of the fur coding region. Similarly, the fur promoter was amplified with primers 50 -CCATGGGTTCTCCGTTCATT30 and 50 -GGGCCCAGCAACGCGCTGAC-50 to obtain the intergenic region plus 156 bp of the omlA coding region. PCR products were cloned into the ApaI/NcoI sites of a pGem-T vector carrying an NcoI/NotI EGFP gene. The constructs were subcloned into the ApaI/NotI sites of pBlueScript (Stratagene) and subsequently moved into the pKX3333 with KpnI/SacI. All constructs were verified by sequencing and used to transform competent X. citri cells. The reporter cells were infiltrated into Citrus sinensis leaves at a density of 108 cells per mL. After 5­10 days, leaf sectors with canker lesions were sliced and placed in sterile water for 10 min. Bacterial cells were recovered by centrifugation and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.
Circular dichroism spectroscopy

Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were carried out on a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter at 258C with OmlA 15 lM in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8. The far-UV spectra were recorded in a 1-mm optical path length cell in the wavelength range 190­260 nm with a bandwidth of 0.5 nm and scan speed of 100 nm min21. The near-UV spectra were recorded in a 10-mm

optical path length cell in the wavelength range 250­350 nm. For each measurement, the average of 10 (far-UV) or 100 (near-UV) spectra were taken to improve the signal to noise ratio and each spectrum was corrected by subtracting its blank.
NMR sample preparation and data acquisition

N-OmlA or double-labelled 15N/13C-OmlA at 0.3 mM were prepared in 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 5.8, containing 0.05% NaN3 and 5 or 100% D2O. 2D and 3D NMR spectra were collected at 258C on spectrometers Varian Inova AS 500 MHz or 600 MHz at the CeBiMELNLS, Brazil, or on a Varian Inova AS 600 MHz at the CIM, University of Parma, Italy. All NMR spectrometers were equipped with a z pulsed-field gradient unit and a triple resonance probe.

Exchangeable amide protons were also identified by À the 2D (CLEANEX-PM)-FHSQC experiment.40 1HÀ 15 NÀ ÀHSQC and CLEANEX-PM spectra were performed at 600 MHz with a 15N labeled sample using a mixing time of 150 ms. The amide protons accessibility was measured as the ratio of the peak volumes of the 1HÀ À 15 NÀ ÀHSQC and the CLEANEX-PM spectra and also by the permanence of amide signals in the 1HÀ 15NÀ À ÀHSQC collected after D2O addition.
Backbone 15N relaxation measurements and analysis

NOE-derived distance restraints were obtained from 3D 1HÀ 15NÀ À ÀNOESY34 and 3D 1HÀ 13CÀ À ÀNOESY (separately optimized for aliphatics and aromatics)35 collected with 100-ms mixing times. All spectra were processed and analyzed using NMRView/NMRPipe softwares.36,37 After manual assignment, 3D NOESY crosspeaks volumes were converted in distance constraints using the NMRView automatic integration function.36 Structure calculation and refinement were performed using DYANA 1.5 program package.38 The final round of refinement started with 180 randomized structures, and the 40 best DYANA conformers selected on the basis of their minimum target function were further energyminimized with the DISCOVER module. After minimization, 20 structures, selected on the basis of their lower ° energy and of systematic violations less than 0.2 A for residual NOE and less than 58 for dihedral angles were chosen to represent the NMR structure. The quality of the structures was evaluated with the program PROCHECK-NMR.39 The structural coordinates of the ensemble of the 20 conformers that represent the solution structure of OmlA have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number: 2PXG.
Hydrogen exchange measurements

Longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times as well as 1HÀ 15N NOEs of backbone amides were À determined using experiments acquired at 500 MHz with a 15N-OmlA sample.41 The 1HÀ 15N NOE values were À taken as the ratio of the peak volumes of the experiments recorded with and without 1H saturation using a saturation time of 3 s and a recycle delay of 6 s. Relaxation delays of 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, and 900 ms were employed for T1 measurements, and 1, 5, 9, 13, 19, 27, 33, and 39 ms for T2 measurements. T1 and T2 values were extracted by fitting the peak intensities to a single exponential decay function in NMRView.36 Reduced spectral density mapping analysis was performed according to the equations described42: rNH ¼ R1 ðNOE À 1ÞðgN =gH Þ J ð0:87xH Þ ¼ J ðxN Þ ¼ J ð0Þ ¼ 4rNH 5d 2

RESULTS
The X. citri OmlA

Proton­deuterium (H/D) exchange measurements were performed with a lyophilized 15N-labeled sample dissolved in 100% D2O (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). The loss of intensity of labile protons was monitored by recording a series of 1HÀ 15NÀ À ÀHSQC spectra at 500 MHz. The elapsed time between dissolving the lyophilized protein and starting the first 1HÀ 15NÀ À ÀHSQC experiment was 8 min and a series of 1HÀ 15NÀ À ÀHSQC spectra were recorded every 20 min for 24 h.

The XAC1516 locus from X. citri encodes a predicted 15 kDa OmlA protein with a typical lipoprotein signal peptide at N-terminus and a central SmpA_OmlA domain common to several beta and gamma proteobacteria lipoproteins (see Fig. 1). The signal peptide carries the lipobox motif43 with the conserved cysteine residue required for lipid attachment (see Fig. 1). In addition,

OmlA and fur are coregulated during citrus infection

To verify that OmlA was produced by X. citri, the omlA gene was amplified and expressed in E. coli cells without the signal peptide. Additionally, the cysteine residue of the lipobox was replaced by a serine (see Fig. 1). The recombinant OmlA, a protein of 118 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 13.6 kDa was purified by affinity and ion exchange chromatography [Fig. 2(A)] and used for antibody production. The OmlA antiserum recognized the purified recombinant OmlA as well as a single protein of similar molecular mass present in the cell extracts of X. citri grown in culture media or isolated from citrus canker lesions [Fig. 2(B)]. These findings confirm the production of OmlA by X. citri. Because the omlA and fur genes are located opposite to each other and share a divergent promoter in the X. citri

Interestingly, in agreement with the higher amounts of OmlA detected in bacterial cells recovered from canker lesions [Fig. 2(B)], both omlA and fur promoters showed much higher activities in X. citri grown in orange leaves than in culture medium [Fig. 2(C)].
Protein characterization

CD spectrum of OmlA in sodium phosphate buffer [Fig. 3(A)] is suggestive of a protein presenting random coil components together with a mixture of b-sheet and a-helical secondary structure elements. The near-UV spectrum [Fig. 3(B)] reveals several bands in the region of 260­300 nm, suggesting the presence of aromatic clusters.

layer sandwich architecture [Fig. 5(B)]. It is worth noting that loop 2, connecting a2 with b1, contains three prolines, one of which is conserved in the OmlA family (see Fig. 1), whereas loop 3 is quite long and flexible [Fig. 5(B)], as evidenced by the very high RMSD (Table I). The analysis of the protein surface [Fig. 5(C)] shows hydrophilic patches mainly in the region of the b-sheet and in loop 3, whereas hydrophobic areas are located particularly at the interfaces between the two a-helices. Interestingly, the hydrophobic side chains of residues conserved in the OmlA family (see Fig. 1) face the interior of the protein forming the hydrophobic core. Moreover, the detection of a network of NOEs involving some of these residues (F72, F76, Y55, Y88, W53, and W84) is consistent with the formation of an aromatic cluster that contributes to the stabilization of the protein (see Fig. 6).

All 1H, 15N, and 13C backbone resonances were completely assigned (BMRB 6797),32 and the resonances of all amides are indicated in the 1HÀ 15N HSQC spectrum [Fig. 4(A)]. À The OmlA structure was resolved with the program DYANA using 1115 distance constraints derived from 3D 1 HÀ 15NÀ À ÀNOESY and 1HÀ 13CÀ À ÀNOESY. The structural statistics of the ensemble of the 20 lower energy structures are shown in Table I and the backbone superposition is illustrated in Figure 5(A). The analysis of the data in Table I highlights the good stereochemical features of the models. In fact, there are no residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot and the residues in the generously allowed regions (only 1.1%) belong to the flexible loops. The good quality of the structural definition is highlighted by the RMSD measured for the 20 selected models in the folded region. Significantly, if we do not consider the long loop 3 (residues T58-I69), the RMSD falls to 1.01 Æ 0.28 for backbone and 1.84 Æ 0.23 for the heavy atoms. The structure of OmlA shows the N- and C- termini unfolded [Fig. 5(A)], with a well structured core characterized by two small a-helices (a1: V23-L26; a2: Q34L39) and three anti-parallel b-strands (b1: W53-S57; b2: K70-F76, and b3: Q80-G86) [Fig. 5(B)]. The two a-helices, that exhibit an antiparallel orientation with respect to each other, pack against the b-sheet, forming a two-

H/D exchange and CLEANEX experiments were performed using the 15N labeled OmlA to evaluate the compactness of the protein. The CLEANEX-type 1 HÀ 15NÀ À ÀHSQC spectrum of OmlA shows numerous water­NOE correlations [Fig. 4(B)], indicating that a good number of the amide protons are highly accessible to water. In particular, they refer to the amide protons belonging to the loops and to the unfolded regions. Consistent with the CLEANEX experiments, the H/D exchange measurements show high exchange rates for most of the amide protons. The ones protected for longer than 285 min [Fig. 4(C)] are associated with the residual globular structure of the folded hydrophobic core. Taken together, the data suggest a protein structure characterized by a rather solvent protected hydrophobic core, while both the loops and the N- and C- termini are fairly solvent accessible. The comparison of the ratio between the 1HÀ 15NÀ À ÀHSQC and the CLEANEX-PM peak intensities with both the secondary structure pattern and the plot of the persistence of the amide signals in H/ D experiments (see Fig. 7) shows that the residues involved in secondary structure are characterized by a stronger solvent-protection and higher 1HÀ 15NÀ À ÀHSQC/ CLEANEX peak intensity ratios, thus confirming the structural model proposed.
Backbone relaxation data and reduced spectral density analysis

As expected, the patterns of the 1HÀ 15NÀ À ÀNOEs [Fig. 8(A), upper panel] and T2 [Fig. 8(A), middle panel] values confirm that the unstructured N- and C- termini are highly flexible. In particular, residues 2­7, 19, 20, and 97­118 generate negative NOEs, indicating fast backbone mobility in the pico to nanosecond time scale. Interestingly, residues 10­19, which span the conserved QGN motif, and residues 61­68 of loop 3 exhibit small ( 0.5),

residues that are common to OmlA and BLIP not only are conserved in the OmlA family [Figs. 1 and 9(B)] but they are also found in similar spatial locations in the 3D structures of the proteins [Fig. 9(C)]. In addition, it is worth noting that residue D62 of loop 3 in OmlA presents a spatial location similar to BLIP D49 [Fig. 9(D)], which forms hydrogen bonds with the b-lactamase catalytic site and blocks the enzyme activity.50

DISCUSSION To date, only a few structures of bacterial lipid-modified proteins have been determined,15­19 and none of them are related to OmlA. Here, we present the first structure of a member of the SpmA/OmlA family from a bacterial plant pathogen. OmlA possesses two highly flexible tails and a central structured region stabilized by a hydrophobic cluster

though positive NOEs, suggesting that those portion of the protein are disordered but not as flexible as the Nand C- termini. Overall, the data point towards a protein architecture characterized by regions with diverse dynamics. 15 N relaxation measurements were further analyzed by reduced spectral density mapping.42 The low values of J(0), which is sensitive to slow internal motions on the milli to microsecond time scale, confirm that OmlA is characterized by flexible termini and by a more rigid core [Fig. 8(B), upper panel]. This is consistent with the pattern of J(0.87xH) [Fig. 8(B), middle panel], a parameter sensitive to fast internal motions. In particular, values of J(0.87xH) higher than the average for the structured core were found for the residues of loop 3, confirming its pronounced flexibility. Interestingly, however, the majority of the residues of loop 3 show unusually large J(0) values, which may reflect contributions from conformational exchange,45 a feature that has been suggested to be important for biological function.46,47
OlmA display a BLIP fold

Surprisingly, using the CATH server,48 we found that the OmlA core has a fold similar to the two 76-residue domains of the b-lactamase inhibitory protein BLIP (see Fig. 9), involved in protein binding and inhibition of blactamase activity.49­51 The OmlA models could be well superposed to both BLIP domains [Fig. 9(A)]. In addition, primary sequence alignments of OmlA with the two BLIP domains revealed significant sequence similarities within the OmlA structured core, particularly in the region comprising the helix­loop­helix [Fig. 9(B)], which is also the region with the highest degree of identity shared by the two BLIP domains.49 Moreover, five of the

involving conserved aromatic residues (F72, F76, Y55, Y88, W53, and W84). Interestingly, this structured core nearly matches the assigned SmpA_OmlA domain, suggesting that, in the OmlA family, the region with the highest degree of conservation is the folded one. Accordingly, most of the conserved residues in the OmlA structure are located in or adjacent to regions of secondary structure. Backbone dynamics and amide exchange experiments reveal that residues involved in secondary structure elements are relatively rigid and solvent protected, whereas those in the loops as well as in the N- and C- termini ex-

perience a high degree of flexibility and are solvent exposed. In addition, the 15N relaxation rates and the reduced spectral density analysis indicate that the protein exhibits regions characterized by variable internal dynamics and conformational plasticity. Though we recognize that the protein in its native form is bound to the bacterial membrane, a situation certainly different from our experimental conditions, we believe that the dynamic features of the protein core as well as of the loops may indeed provide a realistic description of the protein flexibility. In fact, we envisage the protein internal motions as an essential property to allow the onset of the conforma-

The N- and C- termini of the proteins are indicated. (B) Protein sequence alignment of OmlA with the two BLIP domains, BLIP-N (residues 1­81) and BLIP-C (residues 82­165).49 Identical residues between OmlA and BLIP are denoted by asterisks whereas residues that are conserved in BLIP and are also found among the OmlA homologs are bold-shaded; the first b-strand of the BLIP-C domain is missing in the OmlA structure and it is bold-underlined. (C) Structural overlay of OmlA and BLIP residues that are conserved in the OmlA protein family as shown in (B).

tional reorientations required during protein­protein interaction. Notably, OmlA has a fold similar to the BLIP domains, which bind tightly to class A b-lactamases. These domains form a concave polar surface that docks onto a convex protrusion on the enzyme, while the b-hairpin loop in domain 1 blocks the active site of the b-lactamase through the action of residue D49.50,51 Remarkably, we found that OmlA and BLIP share a number of structural similarities such as their amino acid sequences

and fold. In addition, some of the residues that are conserved in the OmlA family are found in equivalent spatial positions in the two BLIP domains. The external face of the OmlA b-sheet is relatively polar and residue D62, found at the tip of loop 3, appears to correspond to BLIP D49, which also sits at the tip of a flexible loop. Thus, on the basis of these results, we hypothesize that OmlA could interact with one or more proteins of the cell envelope to stabilize or modulate their activity. However, since X. citri produces b-lactamases and is resistant

to b-lactams, it seems unlikely that OmlA may function as a b-lactamase inhibitor. In fact, the growth of a b-lactamase-producing strain of E. coli was unaffected by the over-expression of X. citri OmlA (data not shown). Gene knock-out studies have indicated a role for BLIP in cell morphology and sporulation and a hypothesis has been put forward suggesting that penicillin-binding proteins, which controls cells wall synthesis, could be targets of BLIPs.52,53 Notably, the omlA mutants described to date exhibit alterations in cell wall stability and permeability.20­22 Such a phenotype is observed also in the oprL mutant, which presents an altered peptidoglycanassociated lipoprotein (Pal), required for outer membrane integrity and nutrient transport.54,55 Pal interacts with the periplasmic protein TolB and the outer membrane OmpA.56 Interestingly, a search in the protein family databank revealed that proteins of the SmpA/ OmlA family present two types of domain architectures; one in which the domain is found alone (OmlA) and another where it is fused to the OmpA domain. Thus, the SmpA_OmlA domain may function as a protein module involved in protein­protein interaction. As it is for TolB, Pal, and OmpA, OmlA could interact with a multi-protein complex that links the peptidoglycan to the outer membrane. Consistent with this idea is the recent finding that the SmpA lipoprotein from E. coli (35% of identity with OmlA) interacts with the YaeT complex, required for the assembly of outer membrane proteins.20 This complex, however, does not appear to be conserved in X. citri, since one of its components, NlpB,57 is not found in the X. citri genome. Interestingly, only the SmpA_OmlA domain is conserved between the E. coli and X. citri proteins (see Fig. 1), thus supporting the notion that the SmpA_OmlA domain functions as a module for protein­protein interaction. The observation that OmlA and Fur are coregulated from a divergent promoter in X. citri during citrus infection, suggests that they are required for host colonization and may be functionally related. In most bacteria, Fur controls transcription of genes associated to iron uptake and stress responses.26­28 In Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, iron availability is a limiting factor for pathogen growth,58 nonetheless, a X. oryzae pv. oryzae fur mutant, which produces siderophores in a constitutive manner, shows growth deficiency in rice leaves and compromised antioxidant functions,59 suggesting that Fur-regulated genes, not associated to iron uptake, are required during infection. Accordingly, in X. citri we did not observe significant changes in omlA/fur transcription or in OmlA protein levels in response to iron supplementation or depletion (data not shown). In conclusion, the role of OmlA during citrus infection remains unknown and it is not clear, at this stage, whether a functional connection between OmlA and Fur exists. However, as Fur influences transcription of membrane and peptidoglycan proteins such as TolB and Pal60

and OmlA may interact with protein complexes like YaeT,20 it is reasonable to hypothesize that expression of both OmlA and Fur need to be coupled to allow the assembly of cell wall components required for pathogen growth during X. citri infection. REFERENCES
