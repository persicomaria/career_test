Summary An epizootic among monkeys imported into the United States created an immediate need for detection of antibodies to filoviruses. Thousands of samples were submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing. Problems of sensitivity and specificity existed in the methods available for these assays. The experiments described in this report resulted in improved methods for the detection of antibodies to filoviruses, both for indirect fluorescent antibody assays (IFA) by standardizing methods and the Western blot (WB) by minimizing antigen load and by incorporating skim milk in diluents. Filovirus; Testing method

Introduction In November 1989, an epizootic occurred among cynomolgus monkeys imported from the Philippines to primate facilities in the United States (CDC, 1989; Jahrling et al., 1990). Simian hemorrhagic fever (SHF) virus and filovirus were isolated from the monkeys (Jahrling et al., 1990). Of the many filovirus isolations made during these outbreaks, only two were studied in depth: the Reston (RES) virus from the first outbreak isolated at United States Army

Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Ft. Detrick, Md. (kindly supplied by them) and the Pennsylvania virus (PENN) isolated here in our laboratories at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (CDC, 1990). Prior to 1989, the only known filoviruses were two strains of Ebola (Zaire and Sudan) and Marburg virus, all of which cause an often fatal disease in humans (Martini and Siegert, 1971; Pattyn, 1978). The first outbreak of Marburg virus disease occurred in 1967 in Germany and Yugoslavia where 31 humans contracted the disease from infected monkeys imported from Uganda; seven of these patients died (Martini and Siegert, 1971). Two outbreaks of Ebola virus disease in 1976 (Pattyn, 1978) and one in 1979 (Baron et al., 1983) affected hundreds of people resulting in mortality rates of 35% to 88% (Baron et al., 1983; Pattyn, 1978). As a result of the 1967 outbreak of Marburg virus disease, a requirement for a 31-day quarantine of imported monkeys was established in the United States and several other countries (CDC, 1989). In response to the epizootics among monkeys imported from the Philippines, CDC began a large filovirus-antibody screening program of all monkeys in U.S. quarantine facilities. The most sensitive and specific method available for this screening was the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test. However, interpretation of test reactions to tilovirus antigens has long been a problem (Pattyn, 1978), and extensive efforts were made to work out the problems encountered with the IFA test. Confirmation was required for all IFA-positive human sera and many monkey serum samples. Western blotting (WB) was chosen as the method for confirmation primarily because tiloviruses do not have hemagglutinating antigens and it has not been possible to demonstrate neutralizing antibodies after infection. Radioimmunoprecipitation assays (RIPAs) were used to evaluate other methods but the logistics of RIPAs precluded its general use. Filoviruses have seven known virion proteins, the large protein (L) with a molecular mass of'"200 kDa, the glycoprotein (GP) with a M, of 120 kDa, the nucleoprotein (NP) with an apparent M, of 105 kDa and four other proteins, VP40, VP35, VP30 and VP24 named for their apparent molecular mass in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Elliott et al., 1985). Two of these proteins, the L and GP are difficult to visualize on WBs and RIPAs except under special conditions, because they are present in such small quantities. Here, we describe our work to minimize the background staining problems with VP40 and VP35 and intensify the specific reactions with the NP, VP30, and VP24, resulting in improved specificity in screening for filovirus antibodies.

Materials and Methods Growth and puriJication of viruses Five viruses were used in these studies: Marburg virus; Ebola-Zaire virus; Ebola-Sudan virus, RES and PENN. Comprehensive tests were performed at CDC and at USAMRIID to ensure that RES and PENN viruses were not contaminated with SHF. All viruses were plaque purified three times before being used, and were grown and purified as described previously (Elliott et al., 1985). The optimal harvest time for the Zaire strain of Ebola virus was 3-4 days; all other viruses were harvested 6 to 8 days postinfection. All work on infectious virus was done in the maximum containment laboratory (MCL) at CDC. Antigen production for IFA slides Slides were prepared essentially as described by Johnson et al. (1981), except for the following refinements. Glass beads were used to remove the cells from the surface of flasks, and after being washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were suspended in fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells from no more than two 150-cm2 flasks were suspended in 1 ml of FBS to avoid overcrowding. These infected cells were then inactivated by gamma irradiation with 2 million rads while being kept cool with crushed ice (Elliott et al., 1982). After inactivation, safety tests were performed to ensure that no infectious virus remained. Cells were then counted and suspended in 100% FBS at a concentration of 12 x lo6 cells per ml and stored in vapor-phase nitrogen freezers. At the concentration chosen for storage, one vial of cells resuspended in 12 ml of saline and 2% FBS was enough to prepare 75 to 100 12-well slides (HTC white, autoclavable, No. 10-l 11 from Cel-Line Assoc., P. 0. Box 35, Newtield, NJ 08344*). Multi-antigen slides were prepared by mixing infected cells to the desired mix and concentration. Slides prepared in this manner could be stored at -20°C for at least 1 yr. IFA assay The IFA assay is well documented (Wulff and Lange, 1975). The FITClabeled conjugate used was goat anti-human (Miles Laboratories, MF-01) at a 1:40 dilution, with 0.005% Evans Blue (prepared at 1% in PBS) added as a counterstain. Fluorescence was read on a Zeiss Axioskop (HBO 100) with a 40 x dry Plan Neofluar objective.

RIPA and SDS-PAGE RIPAs and SDS-PAGE al., 1984). WB procedures Virus was purified for WB (Towbin et al., 1979) as described previously (Elliott et al., 1985). The BioRad protein assay was used for protein determinations, and the purity of the preparations was confirmed on PhastSystem (Pharmacia, Inc.) SDS-PAGE lo%-15% gradient gels, using the silver stain for detection. At the beginning of the study, the BioRad Minigel and Transblot apparatus and methods were used as directed in the manufacturer's instructions. Each 0.75-mm-thick gel was loaded with 100 yg of total viral protein and blotted onto nitrocellulose (0.45 pm, BioRad). Each blot was then cut into 20 strips for testing. Later in the study, the PhastSystem SDS-PAGE and Transblot apparatus (paraphrased as PhastWesternBlot or PWB) and methods were used according to manufacturer's directions (Prieur and Russo-Marie, 1988). The 12 x 0.3 ~1 applicator was used, and lo%-15% gradient gels produced the best blotting results. Block titrations indicated that the optimal amount of protein loaded per lane was 50 ng, which is 1% of that used in the other method. Enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransjtir blot (EITB) technique were performed as described previously (Elliott et

The EITB method of Tsang et al. (1983) was used with some adjustments. Nitrocellulose blots were treated with a blocking solution of 5% milk in PBS with 0.02% azide, 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and 0.5% Tween 20 at 4°C overnight. All washing was done with PBS with 0.05% Tween 20. Test sera were diluted 1:200 in PBS with 0.5% Tween 20, 0.5% milk. Incubation periods were 1.5 h at room temperature, and all washing periods were 30 min, with three changes of buffer. The enzyme (anti-human-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from Tago, Inc.) was diluted 1:2000 in the same buffer used for washing. The substrate was 3'3'-diaminobenzidine (50 mg in 100 ml PBS with 50 ~1 of 30% H202). Serum samples Monkey serum samples were received from 10 quarantine facilities or importers, 12 universities, 6 breeding facilities, and 6 exporters. Human samples were obtained from the same sources and were classified by their exposure to monkeys. Another large group of human serum samples were obtained from persons with no known contact to monkeys for use as a control group. Positive control sera in the initial phase of the study were convalescent-phase

89

human sera with antibodies to Ebola-Zaire, Ebola-Sudan, or Marburg. Negative control sera were obtained from CDC personnel. Later in the study, a pool of serum (#703076) from monkeys that survived challenge with both Ebola-Sudan and RES viruses was used as the positive control. The negative control monkey sera were obtained from monkeys with no known exposure to Ebola virus and had no detectable antibodies in any of the tests available.

Results IFA analysis A total of 5855 monkeys and 1102 humans were tested for tilovirus antibodies from November 30, 1989, when CDC was notified of the first outbreak, through March 3 1, 199 1. Table 1 shows the IFA results broken down by virus and cutoff dilution. In studies conducted during the first Ebola outbreaks in 1976, the 1:16 dilution was chosen as the lowest significant dilution (Pattyn, 1978). Perhaps because of the increased sensitivity of currently available methods, high numbers of positive results and unusual background staining were found at that dilution. Therefore, 1:64 was chosen as the cutoff dilution. In addition, because we were primarily interested in monitoring infection, a screening dilution of 1:64 for the initial bleeding of an animal was used, and then a 4-fold rise to 1:256 or higher in the subsequent samples was considered positive. The percentages of high-titered positive results occurring during the height of the outbreak are shown in Table 2. This table includes only monkeys from facilities where active disease, confirmed by virus isolation was occurring. These percentages differ considerably from those in Table 1, which

spread. Therefore, follow-up studies on these animals were not possible. Of the seven known proteins of filoviruses, the five most commonly seen of the five viruses included in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Actin, at 42 kDa often co-migrates with VP40 of the Ebola strains but can be seen separately in the Marburg preparation because of the slower migration of the VP40 homologue. Although the migration pattern for the proteins of Marburg is somewhat different from those of Ebola, the Ebola nomenclature was used (Kiley et al., 1988).
WB cor$rmution

The IFA assay with WB confirmation was successful initially because studies were being conducted of infected monkeys and humans with known exposure. The WB results showed background staining with VP40 and VP35, but the other proteins (NP, VP30, and VP24) were considered `diagnostic' and were used to determine positivity. Our criterion for positivity was that there be distinct bands at the NP plus either VP30 or VP24. Fig. 2 gives a close view of

As additional serum samples from healthy monkeys and humans were tested, more difficulties in interpretation arose, as exemplified by a group of serum samples from Indonesia (Fig. 3). Only samples numbered 19, 21, and 24 were positive by IFA, but all appeared positive by WB. RIPAs gave the same results when proteins were labeled with 3H-amino acids. Since the GP is the typespecific protein, (i.e., the GP is immunoprecipitated by strain- or type-specific serum only), we performed RIPAs using [3H]glucosamine-labeled cell extracts. Positive control sera immunoprecipitated the monosp$cific GPs, but the Indonesian sera did not immunoprecipitate GPs from any of the Ebola virus strains tested. Positive sera from facilities where illness was documented and isolations were made, immunoprecipitated the RES- and PENN-virus GPs (data not shown). Because RIPAs are so labor intensive, however, we directed our efforts at improving the WB contirmatory assay. PHAST Western blot

We used the problem Indonesian sera to test the PWB as an alternative to the WB procedure (Fig. 4). Each blot contained antigen for Marburg, RES and Zaire, in that order. Anti-Marburg and anti-Ebola convalescent-phase serum samples were pooled for the positive control. The background staining was

Numbers 19 and 39 were negative controls, and 20 and 40 were positive controls containing a mixture of the anti-Ebola monkey serum pool number 703076 and a human anti-Marburg convalescent-phase serum number 126119. PWB methods were described in `Materials and Methods', except that 0.5% BSA was used in the diluent for serum dilutions in the top row and 0.5% milk in the bottom row. The IFA-positive test samples were numbers 12, 16, 17, 32, 36, and 37.

reduced, especially in the PWBs with 0.5% milk in the antibody-diluent, and the positive PWBs more nearly matched the IFA positives. Numbers 12, 16, 17, and 32, 36, and 37 corresponded to the three IFA-positive samples. Titrations of antigens and control antibodies were performed to determine optimal conditions. Even though strong reactions occurred with 1:500 and 1:lOOO dilutions of positive sera, we selected a 1:200 dilution for test serum to ensure detection of all positives and absence of background staining. It was also determined from these titrations that 50 ng of protein per lane was optimal. The specificity of the test and the lack of background staining are illustrated in Fig. 5. Convalescent-phase sera from three Ebola strains reacted more intensely with the corresponding antigen, and normal human sera (negative by IFA at a 1:16 dilution) displayed no reaction to any Ebola proteins. Blind tests Forty sera were selected and aliquoted to create a panel that represented all categories of serum (i.e., positive, negative, and questionable). This panel was shared with three other laboratories in a blind study to determine reproducibility of results. Table 3 shows results of tests performed with this

panel. Consistently lower readings were reported by Laboratory C, which used a microscope with an HBO 50 lamp and a 20 x objective. These conditions turned out to be important, because oil-immersion increased the background problem. As mentioned in `Materials and Methods', the other two laboratories used a microscope with an HBO 100 lamp and a 40 x objective. Once this information was obtained, it was interesting how much variation remained. The anomalous result of serum number 2153 at Laboratory A could be explained by the inclusion of PENN antigen in the multi-antigen slides. The test was repeated several times with the same result, Inclusion of the PENN antigen could also account for the consistently higher readings by Laboratory A. However, when samples were tested by other methods, such as protein migration patterns on SDS-PAGE and reaction to monoclonal antibodies, no differences between RES and PENN were found (L.H.E., unpublished data). A large number of samples, including those listed in Table 3 have been retested using the conditions described. The PWB produces diagnostic results and, compared with the earlier minigel-WB method, can be performed with reduced quantities of reagents, buffers, and supplies and requires much less time. Because VP 30 and VP 24, the other diagnostic proteins in the WB are seldom visible in PWBs, the NP became the criterion for positivity. Fig. 6 depicts the first 17 samples from the panel of 40, using the early minigel and WB method, incorporating all other changes such as the reduced quantity of antigen and 0.5% milk in the diluent. Some background from VP35 and VP40 is apparent in the minigel system but the specific reaction with NP was maintained. Therefore, for those laboratories without access to the Phast

Several remaining problematic sera displayed positive IFA reactions, some to high titers, that were negative by confirmatory testing. The results from a group of monkeys in a facility in Canada that were detained because of apparent seroconversion are shown in Table 4. The facility was able to hold the monkeys for an extended period, allowing several bleedings. These animals were cynomolgus monkeys from a colony in the Caribbean that had been bred in captivity on an isolated island for several generations. They had no known exposure to any other monkeys, yet they appeared to seroconvert by IFA. The monkeys remained healthy throughout the quarantine period, and these IFA titers waned with time. They were negative by every confirmatory test attempted. Some of the monkey samples were positive for Marburg virus antibodies but there was no cross-reactivity between Marburg and Ebola. Every effort was made to be sure that SHF was not contained in any filovirus antigens. All filovirus preparations were tested with anti-SHF serum obtained from USAMRIID at Ft. Detrick and were negative.

Discussion Despite its limitations, the IFA assay remains the method of choice for tilovirus-antibody screening. Attempts are being made to develop other methods, but because tiloviruses have no hemagglutinin and neutralizing antibodies have not been detected in convalescent-phase sera, the IFA assay is the most sensitive and specific method available. Early in the study of tiloviruses (Pattyn, 1978) higher-than-expected numbers of people and animals were found to have low-titer antibodies to Iiloviruses, an observation that raised questions about the specificity of this test for the detection of antibodies in asymptomatic populations. The filovirus infections recently detected in imported macaques have emphasized the need for confirmatory tests. Western blotting, which has its own limitations, was the method of choice for confirmation. RIPAs were useful but they were too time-consuming and their failure rate was too great to be used for testing large numbers of sera. An earlier report (Thean and Toh, 1989) that background staining could be reduced by incubating the blots at room temperature instead of 37°C was conI%-med. During the early phases of the outbreak involving infected monkeys, WBs confirmed IFA results as expected. Confirmation by WB was also the criterion used for choosing the 1:64 dilution for cutoff rather than 1: 16. Many types of blocking methods were attempted to reduce background staining but the technique described in `Materials and Methods' gave the best results. Other detection methods, such as `251-SPA, were not an improvement. The improvements incurred with the PWB system, the use of less antigen and the incorporation of milk in the diluent were substantial.

Serosurveys in quarantine facilities where seroconversions but no illness were occurring presented problems of verification. We are not sure if the serum samples from Indonesia and Canada contained antibody to a strain of filovirus not yet isolated or if it reacted nonspecifically. Attempts to answer this question will continue. Since the IFA titers of some of these samples were so high, even though not confirmed, they may have been due to other filoviruses. It is possible that there are strains of liloviruses that are nonpathogenic. The isolation of the new Asian liloviruses and the seroconversions observed in monkeys imported into Canada from an isolated colony in the Caribbean support this supposition. The fear that specific reactions were being eliminated in the PWB system was alleviated when all positive sera from the early outbreaks and from experimentally infected monkeys remained positive. These tests have led to a procedure that gave diagnostic results in groups of monkeys with known tilovirus infection and failed to react in groups that may have been infected with an as-yet-undetected strain of lilovirus. There is a need for another screening procedure that is both specific and sensitive enough to be used alone. A new Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbant Assay looks promising but still needs refinement. The isolation of the new Asian tiloviruses has created new avenues in filovirus research. Especially critical is the determination of pathogenicity of the Asian strains. No illness was associated with humans in the several however, several persons seroconverted, exposures to infected monkeys; suggesting exposure to less pathogenic liloviruses. Many questions remain about this interesting family of viruses. The availability of more sensitive isolation methods may help answer the particularly important question regarding where these filoviruses exist between outbreaks. Molecular studies comparing the genomes of the filovirus strains and pathogenesis experiments in animals will undoubtedly lead us to a greater understanding of these viruses.
