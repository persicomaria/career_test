tants (2) (Fig. 3B), and accumulation of their siRNAs is dependent on the Argonaute protein AGO4, the de novo DNA methyltransferases DRM1 and DRM2 (5, 11, 12), as well as Pol IV, RDR2, and DCL3. In these examples, it seems, as has been proposed in S. pombe (13), that maintenance of silencing involves a self-reinforcing silencing pathway in which Pol IV­mediated siRNA production is dependent on the AGO4-mediated DNA methylation and vice versa. The role of Pol IV as described here could resolve a paradox of chromatin silencing mechanisms that are dependent on RNA. If the silenced loci are transcribed by a single polymerase, such RNA-dependent mechanisms would not be stable because the suppression of transcription from these loci would also lead to loss of silencing RNA. However, a silencing-specific polymerase like Pol IV may be resistant to chromatin or DNA modifications affecting polymerases I to III and so could stably maintain the silenced state. In animals and fungi the Pol IV clade is absent, but the silencing paradox may be resolved if there are forms of the RNA polymerases I to III with silencing-specific subunits that allow transcription of heterochromatin and, consequently, maintenance of the RNA-dependent silencing. A final general point about silencing mechanisms is illustrated by the GFP transgene silencing and endogenous 24-nt siRNA silencing pathways that are both dependent on RDR proteins (fig. S4). In rosette leaves of the plant, these two silencing pathways are independent of each other because transgene silencing is unaffected by rdr2 (fig. S4) and because endogenous 24nt siRNA persists in rdr6 plants (2). However, in flowers these pathways are interdependent, because the GFP silencing is affected by both rdr2 and rdr6. This potential of silencing pathways to interact, combined with their ability to form feedback and self-reinforcing loops (14), illustrates the potential complexity of endogenous regulatory networks involving siRNAs.

Translational Operator of mRNA on the Ribosome: How Repressor Proteins Exclude Ribosome Binding

The ribosome of Thermus thermophilus was cocrystallized with initiator transfer RNA (tRNA) and a structured messenger RNA (mRNA) carrying a translational operator. The path of the mRNA was defined at 5.5 angstroms resolution by comparing it with either the crystal structure of the same ribosomal complex lacking mRNA or with an unstructured mRNA. A precise ribosomal environment positions the operator stem-loop structure perpendicular to the surface of the ribosome on the platform of the 30S subunit. The binding of the operator and of the initiator tRNA occurs on the ribosome with an unoccupied tRNA exit site, which is expected for an initiation complex. The positioning of the regulatory domain of the operator relative to the ribosome elucidates the molecular mechanism by which the bound repressor switches off translation. Our data suggest a general way in which mRNA control elements must be placed on the ribosome to perform their regulatory task. Initiation of translation generally determines the efficiency of protein synthesis and is the key step for the control of gene expression VOL 308 SCIENCE when fast adaptation is required. Binding of the eubacterial ribosome involves several elements of the mRNA, which affect the kinetics of the

formation of the initiation complex. These elements may include binding sites for translational regulatory proteins (1). Escherichia coli threonyl­tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) plays such a role, because it inhibits its own synthesis by binding to thrS (the gene that codes for ThrRS) mRNA in a region located upstream from the ribosome binding site (2). Although ThrRS and the ribosome compete for binding to thrS mRNA, their binding sites do not strictly overlap. The ribosome binds to the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) region but also to a single-stranded sequence located 50 nucleotides upstream (Fig. 1A) (3). The dimeric ThrRS binds specifically and symmetrically to two stem-loops (domains 2 and 4, Fig. 1A) in a way that mimics tRNA anticodon recognition (4, 5). The crystal structure of domain 2, the essential component of control, complexed with ThrRS was determined previously (5).

teriophage T4 (mk27) was mapped by x-ray crystallography at 7.0 ) resolution (6). Here, we identify the path of thrS mRNA on the ribosome in the presence of the initiator tRNAf Met (where f is formylated and Met is methionine) at 5.5 ) resolution by x-ray crystallography. The operator domain 2 remains structured and protrudes out of the ribosome; its position suggests how the ThrRS repressor protein interferes with the ribosome for translation initiation. The thrS mRNA (­59 to þ19 nucleotides) was cocrystallized with the ribosome of Thermus thermophilus in the presence of the initiator tRNAfMet. This mRNA fragment contains the essential translational operator domain 2 flanked by two single-stranded regions, which constitute the ribosomal binding site (Fig. 1A). In order to improve the binding of thrS mRNA with the T. thermophilus ribosome, the complementarity between the SD sequence and the 3¶ end of the T. thermophilus 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was extended to form eight base pairs. Crystals containing the functional ribosome complex with initiator tRNAfMet in the absence of mRNA, or in the presence of the model mRNA mk27 (Fig. 1A), were obtained under similar experimental conditions (6­9). Data were collected to 5.5 ) resolution (table SCIENCE VOL 308

S1). Difference Fourier maps were computed using a phase set calculated from the existing model (8), completed and refined as described in (10), and the structure factor differences between the thrS mRNA and non-mRNA data sets were computed. The electron density difference map clearly revealed the position of thrS mRNA on the ribosome and the changes associated with its binding. The thrS mRNA enters in the tunnel formed between the head and the shoulder, wraps around the neck, and exits through the groove between the head and the platform on the opposite side (Fig. 1C). Density was found in the 5¶ mRNA region corresponding to regulatory domain 2 (Fig. 1B), which correlates with a kinked helix, as in the x-ray structure of the ThrRS domain 2 complex (5). However, the electron density map indicates a different conformation of the loop structure, which is similar to the anticodon loop of a free tRNA (Fig. 1B). This finding is consistent with the proposal that the domain 2 loop binds ThrRS by an induced fit mechanism (5). A second cylinder of density was observed in prolongation of domain 2, consistent with the formation of the SD helix involving eight base pairs (Fig. 1B). The stem of domain 2 and the SD helix form an almost continuous helix with a 110- kink. Four nucleotides (­51 to

­54) of the 5¶ end of thrS mRNA are folded back into the minor groove of the SD helix, possibly resulting in a local triple helix. The junction between domain 2 and the SD helix is most likely stabilized by additional interactions with ribosomal proteins. Indeed, the ribosomal protein S11 is near enough to interact with the upper helix of domain 2 (Fig. 1C). On the opposite side, the additional electron density may be ascribed to the 15 N-terminal residues of protein S18, which were not modeled in the high-resolution 30S structure because of disorder (11), and therefore are missing in our model. The N-terminal part of S18 appears to be directed toward the major groove of both the SD helix and the upper helix of domain 2 on the 5¶ side of the mRNA. This region is rich in basic and aromatic residues, which would favor RNA interactions. In addition, domain 2 may interact with the loop of helix 40 of the 16S rRNA (Fig. 1C). The constraints imposed by the SD helix and the ribosomal environment around the domain 2 stem place the regulatory domain on the platform of the 30S ribosomal subunit, protruding from the surface of the ribosome. These data correlate with footprinting experiments showing that the ribosome protects two noncontiguous mRNA regions (nucleotides U ­12 to C þ16 and U ­55 to C ­50, Fig. 1A) and the edge of domain 2 (3). Domain 2 is located at a position that partially overlaps with the binding site of protein S1, which is absent from the present structure because of the ribosome purification protocol. Protein S1 interacts with ribosomal proteins S11 and S18 and with helix 40 of the 16S rRNA (11, 12) and is involved in mRNA selection by binding to the 5¶ untranslated region of the mRNA (12, 13). However, it was previously shown that S1 did not enhance translational initiation of thrS mRNA in vivo, and it was also shown that no strong S1-specific effect could be associated with the single-stranded domain 3 (3), a potential S1 binding site. Thus, although protein S1 does not appear to be involved in the positioning of thrS mRNA, S18 may play such a role by direct interaction with the upper stem of domain 2 and the 5¶ single-stranded upstream region. Because tRNAfMet was present in all ribosomal complexes, no difference was observed in the electron density for the peptidyl-tRNA binding site (P site). However, the electron density difference map shows that E-site (exittRNA binding site) tRNA was absent and A-site (aminoacyl-tRNA binding site) tRNA was present in the thrS ribosome complex, in contrast to the mk27 ribosome complex (Fig. 2). The presence of initiator tRNA in the P site and an unoccupied E site correspond to the expected signature for a bona fide initiation complex. The presence of an A-site tRNA raises questions about its origin and binding
Fig. 2. Top view of the thrS mRNA path on the ribosome. The electron density difference between the thrS mRNA complex and mk27 where positive differences (density that appeared only in the thrS mRNA complex) are in gray and negative differences (density that appeared only in the mk27 mRNA complex) are in red, contoured at 3.0 and ­3.0 s, respectively. The map shows that although the mk27 mRNA complex contains tRNAs in the P and E sites, the thrS mRNA complex has tRNAs in the P and A sites. In the thrS mRNA complex, the 23S rRNA loop (nucleotides 2110 to 2118) between helices 76 and 77 becomes flexible as well as the 16S RNA neck helix H28 (nucleotides 919 to 933 and 1380 to 1395), the helices 35 and 37 (nucleotides 1068 to 1073 and 1082 to 1109), and part of helix 34 (nucleotides 1191 to 1199).

mode (cognate/noncognate or near-cognate, which represent the extent of complementarity between the mRNA codon and the tRNA anticodon in A-site tRNA). As proposed in the case of the mk27 ribosome complex, the presence of E-site tRNA was most likely due to copurification with the ribosome and is likely to be a mixture of tRNAs (9). This idea has been recently confirmed by analyzing the profile of the tRNA species associated with the purified ribosomes (14). Therefore, the tRNAs leaving the E site in the thrS complex most likely bind to the A site in a noncognate or near-cognate way. This result agrees with an earlier biochemical study showing that the ribosome without E-site tRNA can more easily accept noncognate tRNA in the A site (15). Our results further indicate that the position of the noncognate or near-cognate tRNAs in the A site is similar to the cognate A-site tRNA as previously shown (8, 9). Thus, our crystal complex would imitate the conformation of the ribosome in the Bpost-accommodation[ step, where the CCA end of the tRNA is oriented to the peptidyl transferase center (16). Changes were observed in the L1 arm, which was shown to adopt different orientations in the 70S ribosome complex containing E-site tRNA, as compared with the free 70S ribosome or with the 50S subunit (17­19). Consistent with the absence of E-site tRNA, the 23S rRNA loop between helices 76 and 77 (nucleotides 2110 to 2118) in the L1 arm, which is known to interact with the E-site tRNA (20), becomes flexible (Fig. 2). In addition, 16S rRNA elements, including the VOL 308 SCIENCE

neck helix (H28), helices 35 and 37, and part of helix 34, were no longer detectable in the thrS mRNA complex (Fig. 2). This destabilization suggests that the rRNA elements participate in E-site tRNA binding. Because thrS mRNA mainly differs from mk27 by the presence of domain 2 at its 5¶ end (Fig. 1A), its positioning on the platform of the 30S subunit may cause the exit of E-site tRNA. A similar function was proposed for the initiation factor IF-3. Because the N-terminal domain of the factor neighbors the ribosomal proteins S7 and S11, it was suggested that it might exclude the tRNA from the 30S subunit E site during initiation (21). Despite these differences between the two mRNA (mk27 and thrS) complexes, we did not observe much movement of the head of the 30S subunit. Both complexes adopt a close conformation of the head (22) despite the differences in the occupancy of the tRNA binding sites, in agreement with the recent finding that the movement of the head is related to the formation of the 70S ribosome (19). The precise positioning of domain 2 relative to the ribosome elucidates the molecular mechanism by which ThrRS binding switches off translation. It is impossible to dock the whole enzyme on domain 2 bound to the ribosome by using the crystallographic coordinates of the tRNA-ThrRS complex (23) because of a steric clash between the entire N-terminal domain and the 30S subunit (Fig. 3). The model supports an indirect competition mechanism, in which the whole N-terminal domain sterically hinders ribosome binding.

Fig. 3. Superposition of ThrRS-thrS mRNA on the ribosome-thrS mRNA complex. The coordinates of the structure of the whole ThrRS are those of the tRNAThrRS crystal structure (21). The ThrRS dimer is shown in green. The N-terminal domain of one monomer (shown in red) overlaps with the 30S subunit of the ribosome.

Consistent with this model, the deletion of the N-terminal domain of ThrRS was shown to abolish control in vivo, and the truncated enzyme was unable to compete with the ribosome for binding, despite its capacity to bind efficiently to the thrS operator (4). Therefore, the elongated structure of the enzyme and the positioning of the regulatory domain with respect to the 30S subunit contribute to the competition mechanism. Such a mechanism does not impose stringent constraints on the protein structure, because the specificity of control can be readily switched from threonylto methionyl-tRNA synthetase (24). This type of regulatory mechanism is also kinetically controlled; that is, the repressor binds the

mRNA faster than the 30S subunit binds to mRNA, and the nontranslated mRNA is rapidly degraded, thus rendering the action of the repressor irreversible (25). Our data show how the ribosome can accommodate a structured mRNA. Other structured regulatory elements found in leader regions of prokaryotic mRNAs, which are recognized by a variety of ligands ranging from metabolites to proteins (1, 26), might follow the same path as that of domain 2. This could be the case for the E. coli thiM mRNA riboswitch, which in the absence of thiamine pyrophosphate is characterized by a structured leader region just upstream of the SD sequence (26).
