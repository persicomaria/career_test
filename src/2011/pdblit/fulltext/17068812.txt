ABSTRACT Human JNK stimulatory phosphatase-1 (JSP-1) is a novel member of dual specificity phosphatases. A C-terminus truncated JSP-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and was crystallized using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Thinplate crystals obtained at 278 K belong to a monoclinic space group, C2, with unit-cell parameters a 5 ° ° ° 84.0 A, b 5 49.3 A, c 5 47.3 A, and b 5 119.58, and dif° fract up to 1.5 A resolution at 100 K. The structure of JSP-1 has a single compact (a/b) domain, which consists of six a-helices and five b-strands, and shows a conserved structural scaffold in regard to both DSPs and PTPs. A cleft formed by a PTP-loop at the active site is very shallow, and is occupied by one sulfonate compound, MES, at the bottom. In the binary complex structure of JSP-1 with MES, the conformations of three important segments in regard to the catalytic mechanism are not similar to those in PTP1B. JSP-1 has no loop corresponding to the Lys120-loop of PTP1B, and tryptophan residue corresponding to the substrate-stacking in PTP1B is substituted by alanine residue in JSP-1.

Key words: phosphatase; DSP; JNK INTRODUCTION Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of amino-acid residues in proteins play central roles in the regulation of fundamental biochemical cellular processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation.1,2 The mechanism in the cell is regulated by two enzymes, protein kinases (PKs), which phosphorylate a specific tyrosine residue using ATP as a phosphate source, and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which hydrolyze the phosphotyrosine residue yielding the restored tyrosine residue and an inorganic phosphate as products.3 Dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) are one of the subfamilies of PTPs.4 DSPs have a motif sequence ``His-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Gly-XaaXaa-Arg-Ser/Thr'' (PTP-loop) conserved in the PTP family at the active site, while showing a little sequence homology outside of this region. DSPs can hydrolyze phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues in addition to phosphotyrosine residues. Several DSPs recognize mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) as substrates, and dephosphorylate both the phosphothreonine and the phosphotyrosine residues in the activation loop. Although over 20 DSPs

have been identified so far, only two crystal structures, human vaccinia H1-related phosphatase (VHR)5 and human mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase (MKP),6 ° have been determined at 2.1 and 2.35 A resolution, respectively. The three-dimensional structures of VHR and MKP are similar, and show a conserved structural scaffold in regard to both DSPs and PTPs. Human JNK stimulatory phosphatase-1 (JSP-1) is a novel member of DSPs.7 Full-length JSP-1 is composed of 184 aminoacid residues and is broadly expressed in a variety of human tissues. The sequence of JSP-1 is genetically identical with those of dual-specificity phosphatase-3 (DSP-3)7 and VHR-related MKPX (VHX).8 JSP-1 has two alternative splicing variants, JNK pathway-associated phosphatase (JKAP)9 and low-molecular-weight dual specificity phosphatase-2 (LMW-DSP2).10,11 Sequence alignments of JSP-1 with human JKAP, mouse JKAP, and mouse LMW-DSP2 reveal 99.4, 91.8, and 93.5% similarity in the N-terminal 169 residues, respectively (Fig. 1). JSP-1 is a small DSP, which is reminiscent of one of the initially characterized members of the VHR-family, and it lacks cdc-25 homology domain found in the noncatalytic segment of previously characterized MKP. JSP-1 shows about 35­40% sequence homology in regard to VHR and MKP. The N-terminal region containing a motif sequence in the PTP family is identical to these DSPs, while the C-terminal region is not. Because of the low expression rate of full-length JSP-1 in Escherichia coli, we designed a truncated protein from a sequence comparison with related DSPs, and the truncated JSP-1 was used for crystallographic and biochemical work. Taken together, this structure and molecular mechanism of JSP-1 provide useful insights into the development of JSP-1 inhibitors as therapeutic agents against JNK-mediated diseases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Expression and Purification Because of the low expression rate of full-length JSP-1 (residues from Met1 to Leu184) in Escherichia coli, we designed a truncated JSP-1 based on secondary structural predictions with related proteins, which only contains the N-terminus region (residues from Met1 to Glu163) to be used. A DNA fragment of truncated JSP-1 without its signal sequence and flanked by 50 -NdeI and 30 -HindIII cleavage sequences was amplified by the PCR method, using a human skeletal muscle cDNA as a template. The fragment was ligated into the NdeI/HindIIIdigested pET32a (Novagen), together with an initiation ATG codon for mature protein initiation, a tag of hexahistidine for purification, and a PreScission protease (PSP, GE Healthcare Bioscience) recognition spacer sequence (Leu-Glu-Val-Leu-Phe-Gln-Gly-Pro, where Gln-Gly is the cleaving point). The C-terminus truncated JSP-1 was overexpressed in an Escherichia coli strain, BL21(DE3)-RP, grown in 23 YT medium at 310 K by shaking, and protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM and incubated at 298 K for another 5 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, and disrupted by sonication on ice. The supernatant was loaded on a metal-affinity column (TALON, Clontech) and eluted with a linear-gradient of imidazole. The active fractions were collected and treated with PSP at 278 K overnight to remove the polyhistidine tag. The

from the amino-acid sequence, and the measured value of 18,654 Da was obtained by mass spectrometry. The estimated molecular weight of 18,600 Da by gel-filtration column chromatography revealed that JSP-1 occurs as a monomeric structure in the solution. The specific activity of JSP-1 for p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP, phosphatase substrate) was equal to full-length JSP-1, while the truncation of the C-terminus region resulted in a 7.5-fold increase in soluble expression rate. Crystallization Crystallization trials were conducted using the sittingdrop vapor diffusion technique by mixing 0.5 lL of the protein solution with 0.5 lL of a reservoir solution, and equilibrating it with 50 lL of the reservoir solution using several original screening kits. After optimizing the conditions, thin-plate crystals were obtained within several days from a solution containing 100 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.8), 28% PEG4000, and 150 mM MgCl2 at 278 K. X-Ray Data Collection, Structural Determination, and Refinement A crystal of JSP-1 was soaked in the crystallization solution containing 10% glycerol as a cryoprotectant, picked up by a fiber loop, and flash-cooled in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. Preliminary diffraction data were collected with an R-AXIS VII imaging-plate detector on an RAMicro7 X-ray generator (Rigaku). Intensity data were processed and scaled using program HKL200012 (HKL Research Inc.). The diffraction study revealed that the crystal form of JSP-1 belongs to space group C2, with ° ° ° unit-cell parameters a ¼ 84.6 A, b ¼ 49.7 A, c ¼ 47.7 A, ° and b ¼ 119.58, and diffracted up to 2.0 A resolution. Diffraction data for this structural study were collected at BL24XU of SPring-8 with an R-AXIS V imaging-plate de-

° tector (Rigaku). The crystal diffracted beyond 1.5 A resolution. Assuming the presence of one JSP-1 molecule in the ° asymmetric unit gave a VM value13 of 2.4 A3 DaÀ1, indicating a solvent content of $ 47.4%. The data collection, processing, and scaling statistics are shown in Table I. The initial phase set was obtained from a molecularreplacement work with program AMoRe14 in the CCP4 suite using the solved structures of DSP as search models, and then a unique solution with the highest correlation coefficient was derived from the monomeric VHR (PDB code: 1VHR) structure. All amino acids were replaced from search model to JSP-1 using program Insight-II15 (Accelrys Inc.). Density modification was performed with program CNX200016 (Accelrys), which resulted in an interpretable electron density map. The initial molecular model was manually rebuilt using program QUANTA17 (Accelrys), and refined against all the reflections in a resolution range ° from 50.0 to 1.5 A resolution with program CNX2000. The current model contains 1 protein molecule, 80 water molecules, and 1 MES molecule, and gives an Rfactor of 25.1% and Rfree of 28.2% calculated using 5% of the randomly selected data not used in the refinement. Statistics in the structural refinement are shown in Table I. A Ramachandran plot calculated with program PROCHECK18 indicates that the backbone torsion angles for most nonglycine and nonproline residues fall within the favorable and acceptable regions. The atomic coordinates and structural factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank19 with accession code 1WRM.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS Overall Structure ° The crystal structure of JSP-1 has been solved at 1.5 A resolution [Fig. 2(a)]. Two residues (Gly and Pro negatively numbering À2 and À1, respectively) that are inserted as a recognition site of PSP remain at the N-terminus of JSP-1.

The electron densities for the nine residues at the C-terminus (from Gly155 to Glu163) are invisible probably because of structural disorder. The crystal structure reveals 156 residues (from Gly-2 to Tyr154) of JSP-1 and one chemical compound, MES, at the catalytic site [Fig. 2(b)]. JSP-1 has a single compact (a þ b) structure with six a-helices: a1 (residues 24­29), a2 (residues 68­80), a3 (residues 95­ 106), a4 (residues 112­121), a5 (residues 131­140), and a6 (residues 144­153); and five b-strands, b1 (residues 6­8), b2 (residues 12­16), b3 (residues 33­38), b4 (residues 49­ 54), and b5 (residues 83­87). The active site cleft is formed with a loop located between the b5-strand and the a3helix. The loop, known as the phosphate binding loop or PTP-loop, has a conserved motif sequence, His-Cys-XaaXaa-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-Arg-Ser/Thr (Xaa is any amino acid), and the catalytic thiol of Cys88 is surrounded by the PTPloop [Fig. 2(c)]. JSP-1 shows a 34.7 and 40.4% sequence homology in regard to its related DSPs, VHR, and MKP, respectively. The RMS difference from Ca atoms of solved structures between JSP-1 (residues 1­154) and VHR (residues 8­ ° 185) is 1.14 A, while that between JSP-1 and MKP (resi° dues 204­347) is 2.80 A. Structural alignment of JSP-1 with VHR and MKP indicates that these three proteins show a conserved structural scaffold, although the spatial alignment of secondary structure elements in JSP-1 is very similar to that in MKP, but not in VHR (Fig. 3). The topological difference between JSP-1 and VHR is caused by the lack of one a-helix in JSP-1 between b3 and b4 strands. Dephosphorylation Site of JSP-1 The catalytic site of JSP-1 is located within a cleft formed by the PTP-loop (containing a conserved motif from His87 to Ser95) between the b5-strand and the a3helix [Fig. 2(a­c)]. The crevice of JSP-1 is rather shallow, ° ° with a depth of 4.5 A, compared with those of MKP (6.0 A) ° ), and the catalytic thiol of Cys88 is exposed and VHR (5.5 A against the solvent region. In this study, deference Fourier maps at the active site show the distinct electron density for a chemical compound, MES, used as a buffer component in crystallization [Fig. 2(b)]. JSP-1 acts on the phosphate moieties of phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and phosphothreonine residues in substrate proteins, and hydrolyzes them, yielding the restored residues and inorganic phosphate as products. MES has a sulfonate moiety that is not hydrolyzed by JSP-1. The sulfonate of MES faces toward the catalytic thiol of Cys88. An inhibition assay of JSP-1 with MES shows an IC50 value of about 120 mM, and thus MES acts on JSP-1 as a very weak chemical inhibitor (data not shown). Most contacts of MES with JSP-1 occur at the sulfonate moiety, and no stacking interactions are found at the morpholine-ring of MES. The sulfonate moiety is stabilized by a helix dipole of a3, hydrogen bonds from amide nitrogens of residues 89­94, and the guanidino group of Arg94. Residues contributing to the hydrogen bonding network at the active site of JSP-1 are well conserved with other DSPs and PTPs [Fig. 4(a)].

The binding position of MES and the distance from the ° sulfur atom of MES to the catalytic thiol of Cys88 (3.3 A) found in JSP-1 are similar to those found in inactive VHR (C124S) with the phosphorylated p38 peptide (PDB code; 1J4X),20 in which the phosphotyrosine residue of the peptide is bound to the substrate binding site, giving ° a distance of 3.1 A from its phosphor atom to Og of Ser124. The electrostatic potential on the surface of the VHR molecule reveals three positively charged patches around Arg125, Arg130, and Arg158. The amide nitrogen of Arg125 and the side chain of Arg130 located in the catalytic site contribute to phosphotyrosine binding, while the side chain of Arg158 located on a subsite participates in phosphothreonine binding. These residues are conserved in JSP-1 as Leu89, Arg94, and Arg122, respectively. In the complex of JSP-1 with MES, Leu89 and Arg94 contribute to the hydrogen-bond network with

by substrate-binding at the PTP-loop. The WPD-loop ° moves about 10 A toward to the catalytic site when a phosphotyrosine residue of a substrate protein is bound to the PTP-loop, and PTP1B changes its overall structure from an ``open-form'' to a ``closed-form''. In JSP-1, the conformation of the PTP-loop is similar to that of the closed-form PTP1B (Fig. 5), while the WPD-loop is formed by Ala55-Ala56-Asp57 (not WPD; Trp-Pro-Asp). Residue Asp57 as a proton-donor is completely conserved, but does not contribute to the hydrogen-bond in this complex structure because MES has no oxygen atoms but a carbon at the cleaving point. Residue Trp179 in PTP1B is substituted by Ala55 in JSP-1, therefore this region does not function as a substrate-stacking loop in JSP-1 [Fig. 4(a)].

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The synchrotron-radiation experiments were performed at BL24XU in SPring-8 with the approval of the Hyogo Prefectural Government and the Japan synchrotron radiation research institute (JASRI).

REFERENCES MES in the same manner as found in the VHR-phosphorylated peptide complex [Fig. 4(b)]. It seems highly possible that Arg122 of JSP-1 plays the same role as Arg158 of VHR when the subsite is occupied with the phosphothreonine residue of a substrate, as Arg122 of JSP-1 is well superimposed on Arg158 of VHR. Structural Comparison to PTP1B Many crystal structures of PTPs, especially human PTP1B, have so far been determined, and their dephosphorylation mechanism and enzymatic characters have also been reported.21 While JSP-1 has a simpler (a þ b) structure than PTP1B does, it shows striking resemblance in three-dimensional structure to the correspond° ing part of PTP1B with a 0.61 A RMS difference at their equivalent main-chain Ca atoms. Conformations of residues around the catalytic site in JSP-1 are identical to those in PTP1B, while both of them show little sequence homology in the rest of the molecules. The largest difference is the depth of the catalytic site formed by the PTPloop (His87-Ser95 in JSP-1, His214-Ser222 in PTP1B), ° the crevice of JSP-1 being remarkably shallower (4.5 A) ° than that of PTP1B (10 A). The catalytic thiol of Cys215 in PTP1B is surrounded by PTP-loop (residues His214­ Ser222), WPD-loop (residues Trp179-Pro180-Asp181), and Lys120-loop (residues Leu110­Ala122), while JSP-1 has no loop corresponding to the Lys120-loop of PTP1B (Fig. 5). The WPD-loop in PTP1B is the essential segment of the catalytic mechanism. Asp181 in particular acts as a proton-donor on oxygen atoms of phosphotyrosine at the cleaving point, and Trp179 functions as a flap of its active site when involved in substrate-binding. Conformational change of the WPD-loop is caused
