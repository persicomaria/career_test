ABSTRACT: A peptide corresponding to the BH3 region of the proapoptotic protein, BID, could be bound in the cleft of the antiapoptotic protein, BCL-w. This binding induced major conformational rearrangements in both the peptide and protein components of the complex and led to the displacement and unfolding of the BCL-w C-terminal R-helix. The structure of BCL-w with a bound BID-BH3 peptide was determined using NMR spectroscopy and molecular docking. These studies confirmed that a region of 16 residues of the BID-BH3 peptide is responsible for its strong binding to BCL-w and BCL-xL. The interactions of BCL-w and the BID-BH3 peptide complex with dodecylphosphocholine micelles were characterized and showed that the conformational change of BCL-w upon lipid binding occurred at the same time as the release and unfolding of the BH3 peptide.

Programmed cell death (apoptosis) plays a key role in the removal of infected, damaged, or unwanted cells. The BCL-2 family of proteins is a crucial regulator of this process (14). Members of the BCL-2 family possess up to four conserved BCL-2 homology (BH) regions and can be divided into three groups: antiapoptotic proteins (BCL-2, BCL-xL, BCL-w, MCL-1, and A1), proapoptotic multi-BH region proteins (BAX, BAK, and BOK), and proapoptotic BH3only proteins (BID, BAD, BIM, BIK, BMF, PUMA, NOXA, and HRK). Imbalance in the levels of BCL-2 family proteins can result in cancer, autoimmunity, Alzheimer's disease, and other serious diseases. Once the prosurvival proteins are neutralized by BH3 ligands (5), proapoptotic members BAX and BAK can be activated by cleaved BID, detergents, or heat to oligomerize and form supramolecular openings in the outer mitochondrial membrane, which leads to cytochrome c release and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (6, 7). It was also shown that the upstream death stimulus p53 could activate BAX and BAK in the absence of other proteins and causes disruption of complexes for both the proapoptotic

multi-BH region or the BH3-only protein with antiapoptotic proteins (8, 9). The structural biology of the BCL-2 family of proteins has developed significantly during the past decade (10), as structures of prosurvival BCL-xL (11, 12), BCL-w (13, 14), BCL-2 (15, 16), MCL-1 (17), proapoptotic BID (18, 19), BAX (20), and complexes of BCL-xL with BAK, BAD, and BIM peptides (21-23) have been determined. However, structural studies of interactions of BCL-2 family proteins with lipid or lipidlike membranes are most challenging technically, and the main details have still not been resolved. Possible approaches to studying membrane proteins by NMR1 involve the use of detergent micelles in solution as a mimic of membranelike environments or solid-state NMR methods applied to membrane proteins in planar lipid bilayers. NMR studies of BCL-xL (24, 25) and truncated tBID (26) proteins demonstrate different aspects of their binding to membranes. The two central hydrophobic helices, R5 and R6, of BCL-xL supposedly insert into membranes to participate in channel forming, like colicins or the transmembrane domain of diphtheria toxin (27), while the helices of apoptotic activator tBID are mostly parallel to the membrane surface. The NMR results for binding of tBID to the membrane were confirmed by site-directed spin labeling methods for EPR spectroscopy (28). In general, these analyses are complicated, because the membrane conformation of BCL proteins can be changed during the induction of apoptosis as was shown for BCL-2 (29). Also, tBID could interact with BAX not only via protein-protein BH3-dependent mechanisms but

Structure of the BCL-w-BID Peptide Complex also via protein-lipid interactions causing disruption of the lipid bilayer structure during apoptosis (30). The prosurvival BCL-w protein is upregulated in colorectal cancer and plays an essential role in spermatogenesis (3133). BCL-w is functionally similar to BCL-xL and BCL-2, but BCL-w is located exclusively on the mitochondria (34). BCL-w is weakly attached to the mitochondrial membrane in healthy cells, and a tight membrane association is triggered only in dying cells upon binding of BH3-only proteins (14, 34). The solution structure of BCL-w (13, 14) reveals that the BCL-w C-terminal tail is not normally exposed but folds as an R-helix in the BH3-binding hydrophobic cleft of BCLw, restricting random interactions with potential partners. The binding of the BH3 ligands releases the C-terminal region from the BCL-w cleft, thereby allowing its insertion into the membrane and neutralizing its survival function. Here, we continue our studies of the BCL-w protein (13) and report a model structure of BCL-w with a BH3 peptide. We also confirmed the previous finding of binding of detergent to individual BCL proteins (20, 24). A working model for the interaction between the complex of the BCL-w protein with the BH3 peptide and membranes is presented for the first time. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Sample Preparation. Human BCL-w and mouse BCL-xL, both lacking the C-terminal transmembrane regions but containing a C-terminal His tag, were prepared as described previously (13). The unlabeled 20-amino acid BH3 peptide of human BID (IIKNIARHLAQVGDSMDRSI) was chemically synthesized (BRI-NRC, Montreal, PQ). Other 30amino acid peptides from the BH3 regions (residues 77106) of human BID (ESQEDIIRNIARHLAQVGDSMDRSIPPGLV) and mouse BID (ESQEEIIHNIARHLAQIGDEMDHNIQPTLV) were subcloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector and expressed as GST fusions in the Escherichia coli BL21(Gold) strain. PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) was used for the cleavage of the fusion BH3 peptide from GST, which results in an extra GPLGS sequence at the N-termini of the peptide as a part of the cleavage site. For NMR, cultures were grown in M9 medium supplemented with [15N]ammonium chloride and/or 13C-enriched glucose to produce uniformly 15N-labeled or 15N- and 13C-labeled proteins or peptides. Unexpectedly, the 30-amino acid BIDBH3 peptides were cleaved in the middle of BH3 region (between Ala-11 and Arg-12, according to mass spectral analysis following reverse phase HPLC) by an unknown protease during the initial steps of peptide purification. To avoid this major problem, we protected the BH3 peptide with the BCL-w protein as follows. E. coli BL21 cells expressing BCL-w were added to the BH3 peptide-expressing cells before the sonication, and BCL-w was removed later during the peptide purification by reverse phase HPLC. NMR samples contained BCL-w or 1:1 BCL protein-BH3 peptide complexes in a 90% H2O/10% D2O mixture, 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8-7.2), 0.5 mM EDTA, and 3 mM DTT. Protein and BH3 peptide concentrations were in the range of 0.05-0.1 mM for NMR titration experiments or 0.5-0.7 mM for three-dimensional NMR experiments for signal assignments. The detergents used in the studies were dodecylphosphocholine-d38 (DPC) from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories and n-octyl -D-glucoside from Sigma.

The bottom panel shows values of the heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOEs for backbone amides of BCL-w in complex with the BID-BH3 peptide.

NMR Spectroscopy. NMR spectra were acquired at 2530 °C on Bruker DRX 600 MHz and Varian Unity Inova 800 MHz spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance cryoprobes and pulsed field gradients. The following experiments were used for backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15 N resonance assignments: HNCACB, CBCA(CO)HN, HNCA, and 15N-edited TOCSY (35). Proton homonuclear NOEs were obtained from 15N-edited NOESY spectra recorded at 800 MHz with a mixing time of 90 ms. 15Nedited NOESY spectra with and without 13C decoupling (refocusing) in the F1 dimension were recorded for the determination of intermolecular NOEs in a 1:1 [15N]BIDBH3 peptide-[13C]BCL-w complex. Amide heteronuclear 15 N{1H} NOEs were measured and used for the identification of high-mobility regions of proteins or peptides (36). NMR spectra were processed using NMRPIPE (37) and XWINNMR (Bruker) and analyzed with XEASY (38). Molecular Modeling. The program High Ambiguity Driven Docking (HADDOCK) (39) was used to model the binding of the BID-BH3 peptide to BCL-w. We used Protein Data Bank entry 1MK3 for the structure of the human BCL-w protein (13). According to the NMR data, the C-terminal helix of BCL-w was displaced from the hydrophobic cleft by rotation around the HN-CR chemical bond in Gly-154 and was subsequently considered in the calculations to be unfolded. An atomic coordinate template for the 20-amino acid human BID-BH3 peptide was generated by the Biopolymer module of InsightII (Accelrys) using a standard helical

The default HADDOCK parameters were used, except only 200 initial complex structures were generated, and the best 100 solutions in terms of total energies were then refined. Structure figures were generated with MOLMOL (41). The pairwise coordinate rmsd comparison between different protein-peptide complex structures was created with DALI (42). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Protein Resonance Assignments and NMR Titration with Detergents. In this work, we determined the NMR resonance assignments of 90% of the backbone amides of human wildtype BCL-w in a 1:1 complex with a 20-amino acid human BID-BH3 peptide. Unassigned residues in BCL-w mostly belong to the region around Pro-117, known to be the site of cis-trans-proline isomerization (13). Analysis of NOEs

showed that the positions of the BCL-w R-helices in the complex are the same as in the free protein with the notable exception of C-terminal helix R8 which is unfolded in the complex (not shown). The binding of the BID peptide caused the largest chemical shift changes in helices R2-R5 (residues 52-96) and in helices R7 and R8 (residues 150-171; Figure 1, top). Measurement of the heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOEs in the complex confirmed the high mobility of the C-terminal region as indicated by the low values for residues 154-171 (hNOEs between 0.1 and 0.6; Figure 1, bottom). For comparison, the values of heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOE for the same C-terminal region of BCL-w in the absence of peptide were in range of 0.6-0.7 (13). These results suggest that the BH3 peptide binds tightly in the hydrophobic cleft of BCL-w, producing specific conformational rearrangements in BCL-w, including displacement from the cleft and unwinding of C-terminal helix R8.

FIGURE 4: Hit-and-run mechanism of the BH3 peptide or a small molecule inhibitor acting on the membrane association of BCL-w. In the first step, the BH3 inhibitor (X) binds in the BCL-w cleft and displaces the C-terminal region of BCL-w which then leads to association with the membrane. In the second step, helices R5 and R6 of BCL-w insert into the membrane as BCL-w adopts its membrane-bound conformation and the inhibitor (X) is released.

The horizontal line in the bottom panel corresponds to a heteronuclear NOE of 0.7.

We titrated BCL-w and its complex with the BID peptide with dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) and octyl glucoside and monitored the changes via NMR (Table 1). Similar studies have been reported for BCL-xL and BAX (20, 24). Our results show that both detergents can displace C-terminal helix R8 of BCL-w from the hydrophobic cleft. However, only DPC led to the formation of a new distinct protein conformation as judged by 1H-15N HSQC spectra in the presence of 5 mM lipid. Further additions of DPC up to 100 mM led to only minor spectral changes (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). Identical results were observed for BCL-xL. At 50 mM, the majority of DPC molecules are in micelles. This was confirmed by pulsed-field gradient selfdiffusion measurements and 31P NMR spectroscopy. We measured the diffusion coefficients (D) of BCL-w at four different DPC concentrations which allowed us to conclude that the complex of BCL-w with 5 mM DPC is considerably larger than what would be expected for the binding of just a few DPC molecules to BCL-w (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). At the same time, we observed a strong dependence of the size of the BCL/DPC micelles on the DPC concentration up to 15 mM DPC. These results were mirrored by 31P NMR spectroscopy of micelle formation (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information). The change in the DPC chemical shift at 5 mM DPC corresponds to 4060% of the total change at 50 mM. These results suggest that BCL-w is bound to micelles at 5 mM DPC and not to individual lipid molecules. All these changes occurred irrespective of the presence of the BH3 peptide in the solution. Most probably, the structure of this new form of BCL-w is similar to models of BCL-xL in DPC micelles where hydrophobic helices R5 and R6 are buried in the interior of the micelle (24, 25). At this point, it was

unknown whether the BH3 peptide remains folded in the complex with BCL-w when the protein is bound to the membrane. BH3 Peptide Resonance Assignments and Regions of Mobility. Thirty-residue 15N-labeled peptides corresponding to the BH3 domain of human and mouse BID were produced biosynthetically and their 15N-1H HSQC spectra fully assigned (Figure 2A). The free peptides were unfolded in solution with negative 15N{1H} heteronuclear NOEs for all residues. The binding of the peptides to unlabeled BCL-w and BCL-xL proteins was investigated. Figures 2B and 3 present the peptide chemical shift changes induced upon binding. The strongest changes were detected for Ala-11, Leu-14, Gly-18, and Asp-19 which are highly conserved in the BH3 regions of all proapoptotic proteins (with the allowance of some Ala/Gly substitutions) (5). It is known that the hydrophobic Leu-14 and negatively charged Asp19 (which hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Arg-139 of BCL-xL) are highly critical for binding of the BH3 peptide to prosurvival proteins of the BCL-2 family (17, 21-23). Despite the obvious changes in chemical shifts, these data alone cannot be used for the precise determination of the BH3 peptide residues which are tightly bound to the BCL-w and BCL-xL proteins. For example, we detected very small changes for His-13 which is in the middle of the BH3 peptide. To overcome this problem, values of heteronuclear 15 N{1H} NOEs for BH3 peptide amides were measured (Figure 3). Analysis of these data showed minimal mobility for residues 8-23 of BID-BH3 peptides (NOEs of >0.7). 15 N-edited NOESY spectra confirmed that this peptide region is R-helical; medium-range HR(i)-HN(i + 3) and other cross-peaks were detected and used as NOE restraints in structure calculations. The BCL-xL-BAD peptide and BCLxL-BAK peptide structures (21, 22) exhibit similar binding regions and helicities for the BH3 peptides, although the helical portion is extended at the C-terminus in the BCLxL-BIM peptide complex (23). Characterization of the Complex in Micelles. The mouse and human 15N-labeled BID-BH3 peptides and their complexes with unlabeled BCL-w were titrated with DPC. Both BID-BH3 peptides in the absence of BCL-w protein exhibited binding to micelles at DPC concentrations above 1015 mM but not at 5 mM (Figure 2D). The structures of BIDBH3 peptide-micelle complexes are under further investigation; these probably represent surface-bound R-helices as proposed for tBID (26).

Denisov et al. in one-dimensional NMR spectra (see also Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). These spectra reveal that the BH3 peptide is released in solution after addition of 5-6 mM DPC. In the second phase, further increasing the DPC concentration (up to 50 mM) led to BH3 peptide HSQC spectra which were typical for micelle-bound BID-BH3 peptides in the absence of the BCL-w protein (Figure 2D). Identical results were obtained for the BCL-xL-BID-BH3 peptide titrations with DPC. We also performed octyl glucoside titrations with the peptide complexes, but these were not informative because BCL-w did not adopt a new conformation that could be identified by NMR and octyl glucoside did not disrupt the BCL-w-BID-BH3 peptide complex in the range of concentrations that was studied (up to 100 mM). These results demonstrate that when BCL-w or BCL-xL forms a new stable conformation in DPC micelles, the BIDBH3 peptide is released into solution as an unfolded peptide. At higher detergent concentrations, the released BID-BH3 peptide can also bind to the micelles. The implications for the behavior of tBID or the full-length BIM protein under similar conditions need to be investigated because the intact proteins contain multiple hydrophobic segments and most probably remain bound to the membrane (separately or as part of the BCL-w complex). However, our result is relevant for our understanding of the catalytic action of small molecules and BH3 inhibitors on prosurvival proteins of the BCL-2 family (43-46). Previous studies (34) have shown that membrane binding of BCL-w is stimulated by a BIM peptide but the peptide localization was not addressed. Our results suggest a "hit-and-run" mechanism for BH3 peptide and small molecule inhibitors (Figure 4). In light of recent results for BCL-xL, BCL-2, and BAX proteins, which confirmed directly the insertion of transmembrane region and helices R5 and R6 into the membrane (29, 47, 48), the general scheme could easily be extended to suggest that all BCL proteins lose their BH3-binding site upon the conformational change associated with membrane binding. Structure of the BCL-w-BH3 Peptide Complex. Our studies showed that the 16 central residues of BID-BH3 peptides suffice for complex formation. To gain further insight, we calculated the structure of BCL-w with the 20amino acid human BID-BH3 peptide. On the basis of our finding that the BID-BH3 peptide displaces C-terminal helix R8 from the BCL-w hydrophobic cleft and forms its own

Two-dimensional 1H-1H planes taken from a pair of threedimensional 15N-edited NOESY spectra with (left) and without (right) 13C decoupling in the F1 dimension. Strips are shown for peptide signals, Ala-15 and Asp-19, in a complex of 15N-labeled human BID-BH3 and 13C-labeled BCL-w. Intermolecular NOEs are doublets in the coupled spectrum, whereas intramolecular NOEs are singlets in both spectra. Intermolecular NOEs between HN(Ala-15) and CH3(Leu-86) and between HN(Asp-19) and CH3(Ala98) are indicated by horizontal lines.

In contrast to the simple titration behavior observed with free peptides or isolated BCL proteins, addition of DPC to a complex of the 15N-labeled BID-BH3 peptide bound to BCL-w led to a biphasic behavior. Addition of intermediate DPC (5-6 mM) concentrations led to changes in the BIDBH3 peptide spectrum that coincided with the spectrum of the free form of the peptide (Figures 2A and 2C). These peptide signals also exhibited negative heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOEs (data not shown). The amide HSQC peaks for Ala-11, Gln-16, and Ile(Val)-17 were very weak, possibly due to exchange processes. In the same sample, the formation of a micelle-bound conformation of BCL-w was observed as detected by the characteristic H 1 side chain Trp signals

a For residues 10-24 and 42-153 of BCL-w and 16 core residues in the BH3 peptide.

R-helix of a similar size in the same cleft, we decided to limit our modeling to a simple docking protocol. HSQC chemical shift changes for both BCL-w and the BH3 peptide were used as HADDOCK distance constraints along with additional intermolecular NOEs from 13C- and 15N-edited NOESY experiments (Figure 5). This provided two medium to strong NOE contacts between HN(Ala-11) and Me(Val82) and between HN(Ala-15) and Me(Leu-86) and two weak NOEs between HN(Gly-18) and Me(Ala-98) and between HN(Asp-19) and Me(Ala-98), which gave the proper orientation for the BH3 peptide in the BCL-w cleft. The general structure of the BCL-w-BID-BH3 peptide complex is presented in Figure 6A, and the structural statistics for the 10 best structures are shown in Table 2. The BH3 peptide occupies the hydrophobic cleft of BCL-w and forces the unfolding and high mobility of the C-terminal BCL-w R-helix. The pairwise CR atomic coordinate rmsds between the BCL-w-BID peptide complex structure (for inflexible residues 10-24 and 42-153 in BCL-w and the 16 core residues in the BID-BH3 peptide) and BCL-xLBAK, -BAD, or -BIM peptide complexes (21-23) are 2.9-3.3 Å (DALI Z factors ) 8.9-11.1). Detailed structural analysis confirms the hydrogen bond between side chains in Asp-19 of the BID-BH3 peptide and Arg-95 in helix R5 of BCL-w (Figure 6B). The side chain of another important Leu-14 residue is oriented toward the surface of the BCL-w hydrophobic cleft. In addition, the imidazole group of His13 is directed into solution, which could partially explain the small shift of the amide 1H-15N signal for this residue during binding of the BH3 peptide to BCL-w (Figure 3). In conclusion, our results suggest that the BCL-w-BIDBH3 peptide complex has a structure similar to known BCLxL-BH3 peptide structures. Studies of the interactions of a BCL-w-BH3 peptide complex with micelles reveal that release of the BH3 peptide occurs when BCL-w binds to the micelle. This suggests that the BH3 peptide binding site is lost in the lipid-bound conformation of BCL-w. These results are relevant for understanding the apoptotic action of small molecule inhibitors of prosurvival BCL-2 family members and models of their action.
