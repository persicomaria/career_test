Caspases are cysteine proteases that play a critical role in the initiation and regulation of apoptosis. These enzymes act in a cascade to promote cell death through proteolytic cleavage of intracellular proteins. Since activation of apoptosis is implicated in human diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, caspases are targets for drugs designed to modulate their action. Active caspases are heterodimeric enzymes with two symmetrically arranged active sites at opposite ends of the molecule. A number of crystal structures of caspases with peptides or proteins bound at the active sites have defined the mechanism of action of these enzymes, but molecular information about the active sites before substrate engagement has been lacking. As part of a study of peptidyl inhibitors of caspase-3, we crystallized a complex where the inhibitor did not bind in the active site. Here we present the crystal structure of the unoccupied substratebinding site of caspase-3. No large conformational differences were apparent when this site was compared ° with that in enzyme-inhibitor complexes. Instead, the 1.9 A structure reveals critical side chain movements in a hydrophobic pocket in the active site. Notably, the side chain of tyrosine204 is rotated by $90° so that the phenol group occupies the S2 subsite in the active site. Thus, binding of substrate or inhibitors is impeded unless rotation of this side chain opens the area. The positions of these side chains may have important implications for the directed design of inhibitors of caspase-3 or caspase-7. Copyright # 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Precise initiation and regulation of programmed cell death is dependent on the action of a family of cysteine proteases called caspases. The members of this family act in a cascade and are clustered into three functional groups. Caspases-8 and -9 initiate the cascade and activate the `executioner' caspases-3, -6 and -7 by proteolytic processing of the catalytically inactive zymogen form of the enzymes. The `executioner' enzymes then promote the apoptotic process through cleavage of intracellular proteins (Cohen, 1997; Salvesen and Dixit, 1997; Nunez et al., 1998; Thornberry and Lazebnik, 1998; Nicholson, 1999; Barrett and Rawlings, 2001). Activation of apoptosis has been implicated in human diseases such as cancer, autoimmune responses and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, the caspase enzymes are targets for drugs to modulate or inhibit their action. Active caspases are multimeric enzymes consisting of two large ($17 kDa) and two small ($12 kDa) subunits. One large and one small subunit form a heterodimeric catalytic domain and two catalytic domains then associate into the globular protease through formation of a large central b-sheet, in an antiparallel arrangement of two six*Correspondence to: K.

stranded b-sheets from each catalytic domain. The twisted central b-sheet is flanked by 10 a-helices. This folding pattern positions the two active sites of the caspase at ° opposite ends of the molecule (41 A apart), symmetrically arranged from structurally identical loops. Substrates bind to these surface specificity pockets in an extended conformation and the subsites within the active sites have been defined by crystal structures of caspases-1, -3, -7 and -8 bound to peptidyl inhibitors (Walker et al., 1994; Rotonda et al., 1996; Mittl et al., 1997; Rano et al., 1997; Blanchard et al., 1999; Watt et al., 1999; Wei et al., 2000). The substrate pockets and the catalytic sites have been probed further in crystallographic studies of complexes of caspases with protein inhibitors (Chai et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2001; Riedl et al., 2001b; Xu et al., 2001). Since these structural studies each focused on caspases with peptides or proteins bound at the active sites, the mechanism of action of caspases has lacked insight into the actual configuration of the un-occupied active site. To streamline the design of drugs targeted to these binding pockets, information about the configuration of critical residues in the active site before substrate engagement is needed. To date, the structure of the inactive zymogen procaspase-7 (Riedl et al., 2001a) and an unusual form of caspase-9 (Renatus et al., 2001) revealed that, for the inactive catalytic domain, a somewhat dramatic conformational rearrangement of the activation loop of the enzyme prevents the formation of the substrate binding pocket so

that the active site cysteine and the oxyanion hole are disoriented or disrupted. The structural features seen in these crystal structures led to a proposal that dimerization and proteolytic cleavage are required for the establishment of a functional active site. In the course of a study of a series of peptidyl inhibitors of human caspase-3, we crystallized a complex where the introduced inhibitor did not bind in the active site, and yet the dimeric enzyme assumed a conformation that closely resembled that of active caspase-3 seen in complexes with peptide inhibitors (Rotonda et al., 1996; Mittl et al., 1997; Wei et al., 2000; Riedl et al., 2001a). No large conformational differences were apparent when comparing the unoccupied site with that seen in the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. Here we present the crystal structure of the unoccupied substrate-binding site of caspase-3. The structure reveals critical side chain movements in a hydrophobic pocket in the active site. The positions of these side chains may have important implications for the directed design of peptide and non-peptide inhibitors of caspase-3 and the related caspase-7.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein purification Human caspase-3 was produced according to a procedure published previously (Mittl et al., 1997). Briefly, caspase-3 was expressed and processed in BL21 (DE3) cells harboring a pET21b plasmid that contained the cloned human caspase3 cDNA. The caspase-3 protein was purified using a Ni2NTA affinity column and the enzyme was eluted with an imidazole gradient. Fractions containing caspase-3 activity were pooled and immediately mixed with an equal volume of 100 mM DTT in 0.1 M Hepes buffer, pH 8.9. After 10 min, the mixture was loaded onto a gel filtration matrix to remove DTT and to exchange the enzyme into 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.02% Na N3. The resultant DTT-reduced caspase-3, at a concentration of 10 mg/ml, was then treated with 2 M equivalents of a peptidic inhibitor that targets caspase-3 at a non-catalytic site. IDN10723 (Ki = 200­500 nM) is a tetrapeptidic molecule with native Asp and Ala at P1 and P2, respectively, and non-amino acid substitutions at P3 and P4 positions (detailed kinetic data will be published elsewhere). Caspase3 produced for this work was $99% homogeneous as judged by SDS­PAGE, and the activity was >99.9% inhibited. Crystallization Crystals of caspase-3 were grown from solutions of 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 4­6% PEG 8000 and 5­7% isopropanol by vapor diffusion with hanging drops using a modification of the protocol in (Mittl et al., 1997). The crystals grew to a size of 0.1 Â 0.1 Â 0.2 mm at room temperature in four days. Crystals formed in space group P21212 with cell ° dimensions a = 70.3, b = 96.2 and c = 44.2 A.

ferred to cryoprotectant solutions containing 5% PEG 8000, 6% isopropanol, 20% glycerol and flash frozen. Diffraction data were collected at À 175°C at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 7-1. The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). A summary of the data collection statistics is presented in Table 1. Structure determination The structure was determined by molecular replacement, using the package AMORE (Navaza, 1994). The atomic coordinates of caspase-3 (PDB code 1CP3) were used as the probe model. Refinement was carried out with simulated annealing in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). An iterative process of model building with the program O (Jones et al., 1991) and refinement in CNS was used to construct the ° model using the 1.9 A data set. In the last cycles of refinement, 147 solvent molecules were added and temperature factor (B-value) refinement was included. The average B-factor for the protein atoms was 35.5 and for discrete water molecules was 39.4. The final refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. The R factor and R free were 25.1 and 28.3%, respectively. Graphics images for the figures and electrostatic surfaces were prepared with MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996) and SPOCK (Christopher, 1998).

Plate 1. Structure of caspase-3. The structure of caspase-3 is shown schematically as a ribbon diagram. Two heterodimers are shown. In one heterodimer, the large and small subunits are represented in orange and yellow, respectively, and the symmetrically related subunits in the other heterodimer are colored green and blue. The two heterodimers assemble into a single globular unit through formation of a large central b-sheet that is ¯anked by 10 a-helices. Four connecting loops in each heterodimer line the substrate-binding pockets that are located at opposite ends of the assembled enzyme. Arrows mark the location of the substrate-binding pockets.

Plate 2. Molecular con®guration of residues in the substrate-binding pocket of caspase-3. In each panel, caspase-3 is shown as a ball-andstick model. The views into the substrate pocket are identical in each of the three images. The sulfhydryl of the catalytic cysteine 285 in caspase-3 is shown in yellow. In (c), a catalytically inactive mutant was used C285A (Reidl et al., 2001b). Thus in this image an alanine replaces the catalytic cysteine. In (a), the unoccupied active site observed in the present study is shown. For comparison, in (b), the residues in the active site of caspase-3 are shown in the con®guration that exists when the pocket is bound to a peptidyl inhibitor (Mittl et al., 1997). The peptide is not included in the diagram, but the sites that are occupied by residues in the inhibitor are labeled P1-P4. In (c), the residues in the active site are shown in the con®guration that exists when the enzyme is bound to the naturally occurring protein inhibitor XIAP (Riedl et al., 2001b). The XIAP segment is not included in the ®gure. Note that there are distinct conformational adjustments in the residues that line the catalytic pocket when the enzyme is bound to substrate analogues such as the inhibitor Ac-DAVD-fmk, but not when the protein inhibitor XIAP binds.

Plate 3. Physical characteristics of the substrate-binding pocket of caspase-3 change on binding inhibitors. In this ®gure, close-up views into the catalytic pocket of caspase-3 are compared when the pocket is un-occupied (a), or bound to substrate analogue inhibitors. In each panel, the substrate-binding pocket is presented as a molecular surface colored according to electrostatic properties of the subsites and surrounding regions. Areas with negative, positive or neutral character are depicted in red, blue or white respectively. Peptidyl inhibitors are shown as ball-and-stick models. The inhibitors shown are: (b), Ac-DVAD-fmk (Mittl et al., 1997) and (c), Ac-DEVD-CHO (Rotonda et al., 1996). The marked changes seen in the surface properties and shape of the catalytic pocket in¯uence binding of peptidyl inhibitors.

studies (Rotonda et al., 1996; Mittl et al., 1997; Wei et al., 2000; Riedl et al., 2001b). The rms deviation for all a° carbons is 0.44 A. The functional enzyme is assembled by an antiparallel association of the two heterodimers which positions two identical active sites at opposite ends of the globular molecule. This arrangement is conserved in all caspases. A central 12-stranded b-sheet with six strands from each p17/p12 heterodimer is flanked by 10 a-helices, and four connecting loops (L1­4) line the substrate-binding pocket. Conformational and insertional differences have been reported in these loops among members of the caspase family. In this study, the substrate-binding site is unoccupied. The conformation of the polypeptide backbone in the L1­4 loops is closely similar to those in caspase-3 when the active site is occupied by a peptidyl inhibitor (Rotonda et al., 1996; Mittl et al., 1997; Wei et al., 2000). The rms deviation for a° carbon atoms in these loops is 0.72 A, suggesting that there are no significant conformational adjustments of the core structure of caspase-3 when inhibitor binds. The unoccupied substrate-binding site The side chains lining the active site of caspase-3 are shown in Plate 2(a). Many of these side chains have been implicated in substrate binding through direct contact with inhibitors (reviewed in (Wei et al., 2000). When the positions of side chains in the substrate pocket were compared in this unoccupied site with those in studies of caspase-3/peptidyl inhibitor complexes, these side chains were located in closely similar positions if the unoccupied and inhibitor-bound structures were superimposed. In contrast, conformational shifts of three aromatic residues that do not directly contact inhibitor/substrate were evident. The side chains of Tyr204, Phe256 and Trp206 delineate a hydrophobic pocket within the narrow binding cleft at the surface of caspase-3. The most dramatic conformational shift is seen for Tyr204 involving a rotation of $90° around the w1 angle [see Plate 2(b)]. This rotation results in a translation of the phenolic group of the tyrosine and a ° movement of the hydroxyl group by 7 A. Thus, when the substrate-binding site is empty, the side chain of Tyr204 occupies the S2 subsite where the side chain of residues in the P2 position of peptidyl inhibitors is accommodated. Consequently, binding of these inhibitors or substrate is impeded unless a rotation of the side chain of Tyr204 opens this area. Accordingly, small yet distinct movements of the side chains of Trp206 and Phe256 may alter the shape of this hydrophobic pocket and contribute to binding affinity. The side chain of Trp206 is located between the S3 and S4 subsites. In the empty substrate pocket, this tryptophan lies closer to the S4 subsite. When peptidyl inhibitors are bound, ° there is a conformational shift of 1.1 A of the tryptophan ring away from S4. For Phe256, a smaller adjustment of ° 1.2 A is seen when comparing the free vs occupied binding pocket. To examine the effect of these conformational shifts within the substrate-binding pocket of caspase-3, the electrostatic surface of this region of caspase-3 was calculated for the unoccupied site and compared with the

corresponding surface of caspase-3 when bound to peptidyl inhibitors. These surfaces are compared in Plate 3. As can be seen from this comparison, the shape and physical characteristics of the binding pocket change markedly to accommodate peptidyl inhibitors. Implications for binding XIAP protein inhibitors In order to evaluate potential conformational adjustments in the substrate pocket of caspase in terms of molecular requirements for inhibition by the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family of caspase inhibitors, the crystal structure of caspase-3 complexed with the BIR2 domain of human XIAP (Riedl et al., 2001b) was compared with the unliganded caspase-3 studied here. The rms deviation for all ° a-carbon atoms in the two structures was 0.70 A. BIR (baculovirus IAP repeat) domains are zinc finger structures that suppress apoptosis by physically interacting with the catalytic domain of caspases. It is striking that the overall conformation of the enzyme remains unchanged when bound to a protein inhibitor. XIAP inhibits binding of substrate to caspase-3 by a `steric blockade' (Riedl et al., 2001b). Similarly, the binding of this inhibitor to caspase-7 completely fills the substrate pocket (Chai et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2001). An Nterminal extension of the BIR domain binds to the substrate pocket. This segment lies across the substrate-binding site in the reverse orientation relative to that observed with peptidyl inhibitors, and the character of the atomic interactions that mediate BIR binding is not strictly maintained. Asp148 in the BIR domain occupies the S4 subsite where P4 Asp in peptidyl inhibitors is accommodated, but there are few other similarities in comparison with the contacts seen in complexes with substrate analogues. The hydrophobic pocket (caspase-3 residues Tyr204, Phe256 and Trp206) surrounding the S2 site is maintained when the BIR segment binds and Val146 from the inhibitor occupies this subsite (Chai et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2001; Riedl et al., 2001b). The phenolic group of Tyr204 in caspase-3 (and its equivalent Tyr230 in caspase-7) occupies the S2 site when the BIR protein inhibitor is bound, both in caspase-3 and caspase-7 (Chai et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2001; Riedl et al., 2001b). This orientation effectively blocks the S2 pocket. Interestingly, the position of the ring is closely similar to that seen in the unoccupied substrate pocket of caspase-3 that we present here. In fact, when the substrate pocket seen in structures of the caspase-3 and caspase-7­XIAP complexes are superimposed on the atomic model of un-occupied caspase-3, the positions of the three residues that form the hydrophobic pocket (Tyr204, Phe256, Trp206) are similar. Thus, the subsites in the catalytic groove that are occupied by peptidyl inhibitors in caspase-3 and caspase-7 are not fully occupied when naturally occurring protein inhibitors such as XIAP bind to the enzymes. In particular, in caspase-3, subsite S2 is blocked by Tyr204 when the substrate pocket is unoccupied and remains blocked when XIAP binds (Riedl et al., 2001b), with no significant conformational rearrangements. In caspases-3, -7 and -6, residue 204 is tyrosine, while valine is present in this position in caspases-1, -4, -5, -8, -9

and -10 and in caspase-2, the residue is alanine. Thus, these caspases do not have the potential to block binding of substrate through steric `placement' of a large hydrophobic phenolic side chain. In the case of caspase-8, crystal structures have been determined of this enzyme bound to both a peptidyl inhibitor acetyl-lle-Glu-Thr-Asp-aldehyde (Watt et al., 1999), as well as in complex with the p35 protein from baculovirus that inhibits a wide range of caspases (Xu et al., 2001). A comparison of these two forms of caspase-8 reveals a conformational shift in the histidine residue in the Cys/His catalytic dyad, which is probably due to the fact that a covalent thioester bond forms between Cys in caspase-8 and the p35 inhibitor. In caspase-8, the equivalent to Tyr204 in caspase-3 does not exhibit marked conformational shifts when bound to peptidyl or protein inhibitors. In summary, the structure of caspase-3 that we report here provides a glimpse into the dynamic aspects of inhibition of this enzyme and perhaps closely related caspases that have

structurally similar substrate-binding pockets. The blocking of catalytic subsite S2 by the side chain of Tyr204 in a hydrophobic pocket of the substrate-binding crevice has been described. Since caspase-3 analyzed in this study is inhibited, the structure of the substrate pocket, although unoccupied, may represent a catalytically impeded active site. Accordingly, it should be noted that the shifts of the Tyr204, Trp206 and Phe256 side chains may not represent their positions in the native active site. However, the molecular events reported here may have important utility for inhibiting and modulating caspase catalysis by binding of compounds directed to specific caspases.
