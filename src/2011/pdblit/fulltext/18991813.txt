Protein histidine phosphorylation exists widely in vertebrates, and it plays important roles in signal transduction and other cellular functions. However, knowledge about eukaryotic PHPT (protein histidine phosphatase) is still very limited. To date, only one vertebrate PHPT has been discovered, and two crystal structures of hPHPT1 (human PHPT1) have been solved. However, these two structures gave different ligand-binding sites and co-ordination patterns. In the present paper, we have solved the solution structures of hPHPT1 in both Pi -free and Pi -bound states. Through comparison of the structures, along with a mutagenesis study, we have determined the active site of hPHPT1. In contrast with previous results, our results indicate that the active site is located between helix 1 and loop L5. His53 was identified to be the

catalytic residue, and the NH groups of residues His53 , Ala54 and Ala96 and the OH group of Ser94 should act as anchors of Pi or substrate by forming H-bonds with Pi . On the basis of our results, a catalytic mechanism is proposed for hPHPT1: the imidazole ring of His53 serves as a general base to activate a water molecule, and the activated water would attack the substrate as a nucleophile in the catalysis; the positively charged side chain of Lys21 can help stabilize the transition state. No similar catalytic mechanism can be found in the EzCatDB database. Key words: active site, catalytic mechanism, phosphatase, phosphohistidine, vertebrate.

INTRODUCTION

Reversible protein phosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases is a key mechanism that regulates cellular signal transduction. In eukaryotes, most of the attention is focused on the reversible phosphorylation of proteins on serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, and related kinases and phosphatases have been studied intensively [1]. In contrast, enzymes regulating the N-phosphorylation of histidine are less well understood, although reversible histidine phosphorylation is estimated to account for 6 % of total phosphorylation in eukaryotes [2,3]. The reason is usually attributed to the N-bound phosphate being very labile under acidic conditions and tends to escape detection, which makes the study of N-phosphorylation more difficult [4,5]. The first vertebrate protein histidine phosphatase, PHPT1, was identified in 2002 [6,7]. PHPT1 shows specific phosphatase activity against peptides and proteins containing phosphohistidine [5]. It was found that PHPT1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, and is well conserved in eukaryotes from Caenorhabditis elegans to Homo sapiens. In C. elegans, the PHPT1 homologue protein is expressed exclusively in neurons, which is an indication of possible roles of the protein in the neuronal system [7]. In addition, it is reported that ATP citratelyase and the -subunit of G-proteins are potential natural substrates of PHPT1, which indicates that PHPT1 may be involved in metabolism and phosphohistidine-mediated signal transduction [8,9]. A recent report has further revealed that overexpression of PHPT decreases the activity of ATP citrate-lyase and reduces

the viability of neuronal cells [10]. In U.S. patents 2453494, 7176285 and 7193051, three new proteins have been identified to be PHPIPs (PHPT1-interacting partners), PHPIP-120, PHPIP180 and PHPIP-240. It was claimed in the patents that these PHPIPs are "of interest in relation to methods of treatment of certain diseases", including various cardiovascular diseases and autisms, etc [10a­10c]. A previous mutagenesis study has suggested that residues Arg45 , His53 , Arg78 and His102 of hPHPT1 (human PHPT1) are important for its enzyme activity, in which the mutants H53A and H102A are inactive, and mutations R45A and R78A decrease the activity by  9- and  2-fold respectively [11]. In the first crystal structure of hPHPT1 (PDB code: 2HW4), five formate ions bind to the protein at a relatively large area near residues Lys21 , His53 and Arg78 [12]. It was proposed that His53 plays a major role in the enzyme activity, and the positively charged side chains of residues Lys21 and Arg78 serve as anchors of the substrate as well as helping to stabilize the charge of transition state in the catalysis reaction, based on the structure and mutagenesis results [12]. However, the fact that the R78A mutation only results in  2-fold decrease in enzyme activity does not really support its role as a substrate anchor. The effects of mutations R45A and H102A on the enzyme activity are also hard to explain, since Arg45 and His102 are both far away from the proposed active site in the crystal structure. While we were performing the present study, a second crystal structure of hPHPT1 (PDB code: 2NMM) was deposited into the PDB with no related publication. In this crystal structure, three protein molecules form a trimer, with six bound sulfates.

Three sulfates are anchored mainly by side chains of Lys21 and Arg78 of one protein molecule, and the side chain of Arg78 of another molecule, whereas the other three sulfates each bind to one protein molecule at a site between helix 1 and loop L5, which is not so close to the active site proposed previously. Thus the different sulfate/formate-binding patterns in the two crystal structures bring more uncertainty to the active site of hPHPT1. In the present paper, we report the solution structures of hPHPT1 in both Pi -free and Pi -bound states. Our NMR and mutagenesis study results suggest that the enzyme binds Pi or substrate by forming H-bonds to residues His53 , Ala54 , Ser94 and Ala96 , and the H-bond pattern is similar to that of the sulfate which binds at a site between helix 1 and loop L5 in the crystal structure 2NMM. This active site is at the edge of the positively charged region formed by residues Lys21 and Arg78 . A novel catalytic mechanism is also proposed for hPHPT1 based on the present study.

20 lowest-energy structures were selected from all 100 structures to represent the solution structure of hPHPT1. The final structures were evaluated using PROCHECK_NMR [19].
Pi titration experiment

Pi titration experiments for the WT and mutant hPHPT1 were performed by gradually adding different amounts of 0.5 M Na2 HPO4 (pH 7.2) into protein samples in Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.2). A 2D (two dimensional) 1 H­15 N HSQC spectrum was collected after each addition at 298 K. The combined chemical shift perturbations of NH signals were calculated using the equation: comp =

Assuming a 1:1 binding stoichiometry, K d values for Pi binding were determined using the equation [20]: obs = 0.5 max (K d /[E] + [Pi ]/[E] + 1) - (K d /[E] + [Pi ]/[E] + 1)2 - 4[Pi ]/[E] where  obs is the observed change in chemical shift,  max is the maximal difference in chemical shift between the Pi -bound and Pi -free forms, [E] is the concentration of the protein determined at an absorbance at 280 nm, and [Pi ] is the concentration of Pi .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample preparation

The human PHPT1 gene was cloned into the expression vector pET28a. Mutations K21A, R45A, H53A, R78A, S94A, M95D, A96D, H102A, -3 (with C-terminal residues Asp123 ­Tyr125 deleted) and a double mutant K21A/R78A were created by PCR mutagenesis. WT (wild-type) hPHPT1 and its mutants were all expressed in the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in 1000 ml of LB (Luria­Bertani) medium until the D600 reached 0.6, and were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 500 ml of M9 minimal medium for continued growth at 37 C for 45 min before IPTG (isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM to induce protein expression. Six hours after induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The protein was purified using a Ni2+ -loaded resin and was further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75 column) with an AKTA FPLC system. The N-terminal His-tag was digested by thrombin (T6884, Sigma) and was removed by affinity purification. The NMR sample of Pi -free hPHPT1 contained  1 mM of protein and 30 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) in 50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.2) plus 50 mM NaCl in 90 % H2 O/10 % 2 H2 O (v/v), and the sample of Pi -bound hPHPT1 contained  1 mM of protein and 30 mM DTT in 50 mM PBS (pH 7.2) plus 50 mM NaCl in 90 % H2 O/10 % 2 H2 O (v/v). Additionally, 3 l DSS (2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane5-sulfonic acid) was added to the samples as the chemical shift reference.

All enzymatic assays were carried out in a total volume of 300 l containing 50 mM Tris/HCl and 5 mM DTT at 37 C. Using pNPP (p-nitrophenyl phosphate; Sigma) as the substrate, the rate of pNP (p-nitrophenolate) production was measured at different pH values (5.0, 5.6, 7.0, 7.4, 8.0, 8.3, 8.9, 9.5 and 10.6). Kinetic assays for hPHPT1 were performed at pH 8.0, at which the enzyme is most active. In the kinetic assays, 10 g of WT protein, 80 g of K21A, 10 g of R45A, 80 g of H53A, 20 g of R78A, 120 g of S94A, 40 g of H102A and 90 g of -3 were used in the reactions. The concentrations of pNPP ranged from 1 mM to 50 mM. The reactions were stopped by adding 600 l of 0.5 M NaOH. The concentrations of the product, pNP, were measured by determining the absorbance at 405 nm and calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 17800 M-1 · cm-1 . The initial rates () were measured at various substrate concentrations, and kinetic parameters (kcat and K m ) were fitted to the equation: V = ([E 0 ] × kcat × [S])/(K m + [S]) where v is the rate of the production of pNP, [E0 ] is the total enzyme concentration and [S] is the substrate concentration.

NMR spectroscopy and structure calculation

NMR experiments for chemical shift assignments are described elsewhere [13]. The structures of Pi -free and Pi -bound hPHPT1 were calculated using CYANA2.0 [14,15] and AMBER7 [16]. Distance constraints were generated from 15 N- and 13 Cedited NOESY-HSQC (heteronuclear single-quantum coherence) spectra. Dihedral angle constraints were derived according to CSI (chemical shift index) analysis [17]. H-bond constraints were added for secondary structure elements derived from CSI analysis and the initial structure. In addition, 1 dihedral angle constraints were obtained based on 3D (three dimensional) 15 NNOESY-HSQC and 13 C-NOESY-HSQC spectra. Initial NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) assignments and structure calculation were automatically performed by CYANA2.0. Then constraints were iteratively optimized using CYANA2.0 and SANE [18], and structures were refined further using AMBER7. Finally,

A 100 mM orthophosphoric acid solution was adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH. Then 100 l was withdrawn, transferred to an eppendorf vial and dried. The residue was dissolved in 50 l of [18 O]H2 O. Then 3 l of hPHPT1 (16 g/l) was added. The mixture was incubated at room temperature (25 C) for 48 h. Then, 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and 2 H2 O were added to a final 400 l system for an NMR sample containing 20 % 2 H2 O (v/v). Onepulse experiment was performed for detection of the 31 P signal at room temperature on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer.

In a control experiment, 2.5 l of bovine alkaline phosphatase (TaKaRa), containing 30 units of enzyme, was added instead of hPHPT1.
RESULTS Enzymatic assay of hPHPT1

Using pNPP as a substrate, we performed an enzymatic assay for hPHPT1. The rate of pNP production has been measured at different pH values and the enzyme is most active at pH 8.0. The rate is reduced to  60 % at pH 10.6, to  50 % at pH 5.6, and almost to zero at pH 5.0. At pH 8.0, the kinetic parameters of hPHPT1 were determined: kcat is 0.35 s-1 , K m is 7.4 mM, and kcat /K m is 47 M-1 · s-1 . The kinetic parameters of hPHPT1 (kcat and K m ) towards pNPP are comparable with those of the dualspecificity protein tyrosine phosphatases Cdc25B (cell-division cycle 25B) and VHR, which are 0.35 s-1 , 8.4 mM and 0.35 s-1 , 13 mM respectively [21]. But the activity of hPHPT1 towards pNPP is much lower than that of protein tyrosine phosphatases, which generally have a kcat /K m value of  105 M-1 · s-1 . Similar to the homologous enzyme in rabbit, the activity of hPHPT1 is not decelerated by the addition of 1 mM EDTA, and it has no phosphatase activity against ATP either.
Solution structure of Pi -free hPHPT1

The solution structure of hPHPT1 in Pi -free form was determined based on NMR-derived distance, dihedral angle and H-bond constraints (Figure 1a, Table 1). The chemical shifts of more than 90 % backbone and side-chain resonances were assigned for hPHPT1 in Pi -free form at pH 7.2. The structure consists of two -helices (1 and 2) and six -strands (1­6). The six -strands form a mixed -sheet. Two -helices are located on the opposite sides of the -sheet (Figure 1b). All secondary structure elements are well defined with a 0.3 Å (1 Å = 0.1 nm) rmsd (root mean square deviation) value for the backbone heavy atoms. In the structure, there are six loops: L1 (residues 15­19), L2 (residues 29­39), L3 (residues 47­52), L4 (residues 80­87), L5 (residues 92­101) and L6 (residues 113­117). The N-terminal residues Met1 ­Asp5 and loops L4 and L6 show very large flexibility, with backbone heavy atom rmsd values of 2.8, 3.2, and 2.0 Å

respectively. Loops L1, L2, L3 and L5, as well as the C-terminal residues Asn122 ­Tyr125 , also exhibit flexibility with rmsd values of 0.7­1.4 Å. Excluding N- and C-terminal residues (Met1 ­Asp5 and Asn122 ­ Tyr125 ), and loops L4 and L6, the mean NMR structure is almost identical to the two crystal structures 2HW4 and 2NMM (Figure 1d). The backbone heavy atom rmsd values for the secondary structure elements are 0.5 Å between the solution structure and the structure 2HW4, and 0.6 Å between the solution structure and the structure 2NMM. In the crystal structures, strands 2, 4, 5 and 6 are one to two residues longer than those in the solution structure, whereas C-terminal residues Asp123 ­Tyr125 are invisible in both crystal structures. In the solution structure, although the C-terminal residues show flexibility, the motion of the C-terminus is restrained, as there are several long-range NOEs between Tyr125 and residues Gly92 ­Tyr93 . The backbone heavy atom rmsd values of Gly124 and Tyr125 are smaller than that of Asp123 . This is further supported by the fact that residues Gly124 and Tyr125 have significantly higher steady state heteronuclear 1 H-15 N NOE values than Asp123 (1 H-15 N NOE values of Asp123 ­ Tyr125 are 0.17 + 0.01, 0.66 + 0.02 and 0.57 + 0.02 for Pi -free - - - hPHPT1; and 0.29 + 0.03, 0.51 + 0.04 and 0.41 + 0.03 for Pi - - - bound hPHPT1). The carboxyl group of the protein C-terminus is within 3.0 Å of the guanidine group of Arg78 , and it is quite possible that these two groups form a salt bridge, which restricts the motion of the protein's C-terminus.
Pi titration and solution structure of Pi -bound hPHPT1

As Pi is a classical phosphatase inhibitor that can compete with the substrate for the active site, a 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC experiment was used to monitor the Pi titration of hPHPT1 in order to map the active site. With the addition of Pi , some of the NH signals show a progressive shift (Figure 2a). When the concentration of

The side-chains are displayed in neon model.

Pi is 20-fold more than that of the protein, the Pi -induced NH peak shifting stops. The dissociation constant (K d ) of hPHPT1 with Pi is determined to be 1.1 mM, comparable with the K d values of some other phosphatases, such as acylphosphatase (0.75 mM), vitamin B6 -phosphate phosphatase (0.8 mM), acid phosphatase (1.0 mM), pyridoxal (pyridoxine) phosphate phosphatase (1.65 mM), dualspecific phosphatase VHR (0.97 mM), and PTP1 (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1) (1.4 mM) [22­26]. We further titrated hPHPT1 with histidine and found that it does not bind to the enzyme (results not shown). This should imply that the native substrate for hPHPT1, phosphohistidine, should bind to the enzyme mainly through interactions between the phosphoryl group and the protein. The distribution of combined NH chemical shift perturbations due to Pi binding is displayed in Figure 3(a). Residues Ala54 , Tyr97 and Gly98 have the largest combined NH chemical-shift perturbations (over 0.50 p.p.m.), and residues with combined NH chemical shift changes between 0.15 and 0.50 p.p.m. are: Lys21 , Val23 , Lys48 , Tyr52 , Tyr57 , Gly76 , Arg78 , Val79 , Gly92 , Ala121 , and Ala123 ­Tyr125 . Residues Tyr52 , His53 , Arg78 , Ser94 , Met95 , Tyr97 and Tyr125 also exhibit large changes for 13 C and 13 C chemical shifts. In addition, two new NH peaks appeared in 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra during Pi titration and were assigned to His53 and Ala96 , whose NH signals were missing in the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum of free hPHPT1 (Figure 2a). The distribution of chemical shift changes is mapped on to the structure of Pi c The Authors Journal compilation c 2009 Biochemical Society

free hPHPT1 (Figure 2b). The residues affected by Pi binding are distributed in a rather large area (over 100 Å2 ) of the structure of hPHPT1. This area can be divided into two sites: Site I consists of residues Tyr52 ­Ala54 and Ser94 ­Gly98 ; and Site II consists of residues Lys21 , Arg78 ­Ile79 and Gly124 ­Tyr125 (Figure 2b). In the crystal structures 2HW4 and 2NMM, either bound formate or bound sulfate could be found at both Site I and Site II. To accurately determine the active site, we went on to solve the solution structure of hPHPT1 in Pi -bound form (Figure 1c and Table 1). The chemical-shift assignments of hPHPT1 in Pi -bound form were obtained at pH 7.2 in 50 mM PBS buffer [13]. The overall mean structure for Pi -bound hPHPT1 is basically the same as that of the Pi -free form (Figure 1d), even though Pi binding causes NH chemical shift changes for residues in a large area of the protein. They have a 0.6 Å rmsd for backbone atoms of secondary structure elements. The most notable structural change upon Pi binding is that the backbone heavy atom rmsd values of those residues in loops L3 and L5 decrease significantly (Figure 3b), and these two loops become more ordered (Figures 2c and 2d). The backbone heavy atom rmsd for loop L3 is decreased to 0.4 Å from 0.8 Å, and that for loop L5 is reduced to 0.5 Å from 0.7 Å. The N-terminal residues of the 1 helix, His53 and Ala54 , also become significantly converged. In comparison, the Arg78 side chain has an rmsd of 1.1 Å in the Pi -bound structures, which is the same as that in the Pi -free structures, suggesting that Pi binding does not stabilize the Arg78 side chain. As it is very

likely that Pi binding stabilizes the binding-site conformation, the flexibility of the Arg78 side chain may indicate that it is not directly involved in Pi binding. The rmsd value of the Lys21 side chain is 0.8 Å, significantly decreased from 1.4 Å in free hPHPT1. In the solution structures, the Lys21 side chain points towards Site I and is close to Site I, and the rmsd change can be also attributed to Pi binding at Site I. Thus, considering that NH signals of residues His53 and Ala96 emerge and residues Ala54 , Tyr97 and Gly98 have the largest NH chemical shift changes due to Pi binding, all together the data suggest that Site I is more likely to be the active site.

Mutagenesis study of hPHPT1

In order to accurately determine the active-site position and to identify key residues for substrate binding and enzyme catalysis, we have constructed a series of mutants, including K21A, R45A, H53A, R78A, S94A, M95D, A96D, H102A and a double mutant K21A/R78A. The enzyme activities of these mutants towards pNPP are compared together with their Pi binding properties in Tables 2 and 3. Mutant H53A shows a  4-fold decrease in K d , meaning that it is not directly involved in Pi -binding. Mutations K21A and R78A at Site II increase the Pi binding K d values by  4- and 9-fold, increase K m by  3- and 7-fold, and decrease

kcat by  100- and 3-fold respectively. The limited effects of mutations K21A and R78A on K d and K m are not consistent with their roles as Pi /substrate anchors. The poor effect of mutation R78A on kcat also denies the possibility of Arg78 participating in the catalysis of hPHPT1. Furthermore, the double mutant K21A/R78A still has a low Pi -binding ability, with a K d of  22 mM. This double mutant still retains a low phosphatase activity towards pNPP, with a 4.2 × 10-7 M/min per g reaction rate (comparing with 5.3 × 10-6 M/min per g for mutant K21A and 5.6 × 10-4 M/min per g for WT hPHPT1) in a 300 l system containing 20 mM pNPP and  450 g of protein at pH 8.0. If the active site is located at Lys21 and Arg78 and these two residues act as anchors of substrate/Pi as reported previously [12], the double mutant should completely lose its substrate/Pi binding ability and its phosphatase activity. Therefore these mutagenesis data demonstrate that Site II is not the active site, and Site I should be the active site. This is also consistent with the effect of mutations at Site I. The M95D and A96D mutations, which introduce a negative charge at Site I, increase K d more significantly (by 16- and 12-fold respectively) than the K21A and R78A mutations. The side chain of Ser94 is located at Site I, and the mutant S94A also leads to a large increase in K d by  38fold, and a decrease of kcat by  40-fold. The effect of mutation K21A on kcat is also consistent with the conclusion, as the amino group of Lys21 points to Site I and is close to Site I. Thus its positive charge may affect the catalysis reaction. It is also found that the NH signal-shift patterns (direction and scale) of residues Ala54 , Arg78 , Tyr97 , Gly98 , Gly124 and Tyr125 are all similar between WT hPHPT1 and mutants R78A, K21A, M95D and A96D (Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/418/ bj4180337add.htm). This may indicate that there is only one Pi binding site, Site I, since we would expect to see different NH signal-shift patterns for mutations of residues at Site I and Site II if there are multiple Pi -binding sites.

changes of residues Arg78 and Tyr125 at Site II during Pi titration are possibly due to the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged Pi at Site I and the positively charged Arg78 side chain, as well as the negatively charged protein C-terminus. H53A is the only mutant that is completely inactive and that binds Pi tighter ( 4-fold) than WT. This suggests that the imidazole ring of His53 is not involved in Pi or substrate binding, but it is critical for catalysis. In the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum of mutant H53A in Pi -free state, it is found that the NH signals of residues Asp55 , Asp58 , Gly76 , Arg78 , Gly92 , Ser94 and Gly98 are much weaker than those in WT, and more NH signals (Ala54 , Tyr57 and Tyr97 ) are missing (Supplementary Figure S2a at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/418/bj4180337add.htm). These residues are mainly located at loops L3 and L5 of the active site, helix 1 following loop L3, and strand 4 underneath His53 . These missing or weaker NH signals indicate conformational exchange motions of the residues due to the lack of the imidazole ring of His53 . Upon Pi binding, those missing NH signals all show up in the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum, and they have normal intensities along with those weaker NH signals in that of Pi -free hPHPT1. Quite a few of the shifted NH signals of H53A in the Pi free form even return to their original positions of the Pi -bound WT protein (Supplementary Figure S2b). In addition, the 1 H and 1 H chemical shifts for most residues have little difference between the WT and H53A in Pi -bound form, except for those of residues Tyr52 , Arg78 , Ser94 and Gly98 , which are close to His53 (results not shown). This indicates that mutant H53A should have a similar conformation to WT hPHPT1 in Pi -bound form. It seems that H53A mutation results in a more flexible active site, which is more preferred for Pi binding. Therefore the imidazole ring of His53 is also important to maintain the conformation of active site. Mutant S94A leads to the largest increase in K d ( 38-fold). It also increases K m by  7-fold and decreases kcat by  40-fold. The side chain of Ser94 is located at Site I in the 3D structure. The side chain OH group of Ser94 probably helps to co-ordinate Pi by forming an H-bond with Pi . This is confirmed by the H-bond between the sulfate at Site I and the side chain OH group of Ser94 in the crystal structure 2NMM. The great chemical shift difference ( 1 p.p.m.) of its C atom, due to Pi binding, is also consistent with this conclusion. Furthermore, both the crystal structures 2HW4 and 2NMM show that the NH group of Tyr97 can form an H-bond with the OH group of Ser94 . This H-bond seems to help define the conformation of loop L5. In the present study, the NH signals of Tyr97 ­His102 on loop L5 in S94A are obviously shifted from those in the WT in the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra (Supplementary Figure S3 at http://www. BiochemJ.org/bj/418/bj4180337add.htm). This suggests that the S94A mutation probably changes the conformation of loop L5, presumably due to the loss of the H-bond. Therefore, in addition to co-ordinating the substrate, the OH group of Ser94 is also important for maintaining the active-site conformation. The replacement of the Arg78 residue with alanine decreases the kcat value by  4-fold. Such a small effect is consistent with its distance from the active site ( 9 Å). However, this mutation increases the K d for Pi binding by  9-fold. On examining the structure of hPHPT1, it is found that the Cterminal residue Tyr125 is very close to residues Gly92 and Tyr93 on loop L5. As mentioned above, the Arg78 side chain and the protein C-terminus possibly form a salt bridge which restrains the motion of C-terminal residues Gly124 and Tyr125 . Replacing Arg78 with alanine will eliminate the salt bridge and result in a loose C-terminus, which may affect the conformation of loop L5, which is important for the enzyme activity. Such a possibility is supported by the fact that NH signals of L5 residues Ala100 ­His102 are affected by the mutation R78A,
c The Authors Journal compilation c 2009 Biochemical Society

although they are distant from Arg78 (Supplementary Figure S4a at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/418/bj4180337add.htm). We also constructed a C-terminal 3-residue deletion mutant ( -3), and found this mutant does have decreased activity and Pi -binding ability (Tables 2 and 3). NMR studies show that this mutation causes significant chemical shift changes for most NH signals of residues on loop L5 (Supplementary Figure S4b). These reveal that the protein C-terminus does have an influence on the activesite conformation and the enzyme activity. In addition, the change in charge distribution near the active site may also be a reason for the increased K d , due to the R78A mutation. It has been reported previously that the R45A mutation significantly decreases the enzyme activity, and mutant H102A completely loses its activity against a peptide substrate containing phosphohistidine [11]. However, our results show that the R45A mutation has little effect on the enzyme activity using pNPP as substrate, consistent with Arg45 being far from the active site. On the other hand, the H102A mutant remains active towards pNPP, but has a  100-fold decrease in kcat /K m . As His102 is also quite far away from the active site in the structure, it should not affect the enzyme activity directly. Comparing the 2D 1 H15 N HSQC spectra of mutant H102A and WT hPHPT1 in Pi -free states, it is found that the H102A mutation not only affects the NH peak positions of residues around His102 , but also causes NH chemical shift changes for residues at the distant active site and even the 1 helix region (Supplementary Figure S5 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/418/bj4180337add.htm). In the hPHPT1 structure, His102 is located in a hydrophobic core region. Thus replacing the imidazole ring with a smaller size methyl group would change the packing of the core and cause global conformation change, which in turn affects the enzyme activity. However, we do acknowledge that peptide or protein substrates may have additional interactions with the enzyme. Therefore, the effects of mutations with pNPP as substrate may be different from those with peptide substrates which are more biologically relevant.
DISCUSSION Specificity of PHPT1

PHPT1 is quite conserved in the animal kingdom. Previous studies stated that PHPT1 from rabbit and pig have specific activity towards peptides containing phosphohistidine, whereas they have no activity towards peptides containing phosphoserine/threonine or phosphotyrosine [6,7]. In the present study, we found that hPHPT1 can dephosphorylate pNPP. Comparing the protein sequences of human and rabbit PHPT1 indicates that the only difference around the active site is that Ala96 and Pro99 in hPHPT1 are replaced by glycine and arginine in rabbit PHPT1 respectively. Three mutants of hPHPT1, A96G, P99R and A96G/P99R, were then constructed. Kinetic studies show that they have similar activity and kinetic parameters to WT hPHPT1. Since pNPP is an analogue of phosphotyrosine, we also performed an enzyme assay for hPHPT1 using phosphotyrosine (Sigma) as substrate. The enzyme showed no activity towards phosphotyrosine, as the 1D 1 H NMR spectrum of 5 mM phosphotyrosine (with 100 M hPHPT1) had no change after 12 h (results not shown). The situation of hPHPT1 is similar to those of protein serine/threonine phosphatases PP2C and orf221, which also possess phosphatase activity towards pNPP, whereas they are inactive towards phosphotyrosine [27,28]. Thus hPHPT1 should be a protein phosphatase specific to histidine-phosphorylated proteins, although it is not specific towards phosphohistidine for small molecule substrates.

Active site and catalytic mechanism of human PHPT1 Active site

343

Although it has been proposed that the active site of hPHPT1 is located at Lys21 and Arg78 , and these two residues act as substrate anchors based on the crystal structure 2HW4 [12], the present study clearly demonstrates that this proposal is inaccurate. On the basis of our NMR and mutagenesis study results, we conclude that the active site is located at Site I between the beginning of helix 1 and loop L5. In the solution structures of Pi -bound hPHPT1, a small cavity with a 4.5­5.0 Å diameter is formed at Site I, which is appropriate for accommodating a Pi molecule. The backbone NH groups of His53 , Ala54 , Met95 and Ala96 and the side chains of Ser94 and His53 all point to the centre of this cavity (Figures 2c and 2d), and could co-ordinate the substrate by forming H-bonds with the phosphoryl group. Our mutagenesis results support a H-bond between the OH group of Ser94 with Pi , but exclude the possibility of a H-bond between the side chain NH of His53 and Pi . Merging of the NH signals of His53 and Ala96 and the largest NH signal chemical shift change of Ala54 indicate that these NH groups may also form H-bonds with Pi . The NH signal of Met95 is invisible in the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectrum of Pi -bound hPHPT1, so the NH group of Met95 is probably not a ligand. Therefore backbone NH groups of residues His53 , Ala54 and Ala96 and the OH group of residue Ser94 are probably involved in the co-ordination of phosphate by forming H-bonds. This is consistent with the co-ordination pattern of the sulfate bound at Site I in the crystal structure 2NMM: the O-1 atom of the sulfate is  3.0 Å to the amide nitrogen of residue His53 , the O-4 atom of the sulfate is  3.0 Å to the amide nitrogen atom of Ala54 , the O-3 atom of the sulfate is  2.8 Å to the amide nitrogen of Ala96 and the O- atom of Ser94 . This indicates that H-bonds should be formed between those residues and the sulfate (Figure 2e). In addition, the amino group of Lys21 and the guanidine group of Arg78 are fairly distant from the sulfate at Site I, with  5 and  9 Å between the nitrogen atoms of their positively charged group and the oxygens of the sulfate respectively. Therefore the electrostatic interaction plays a less important role than H-bonds in sulfate/phosphate binding, which is also consistent with the results from the kinetic study of the mutants. Besides, the bound sulfate/phosphate at Site I is close to the N-terminus of helix 1, of which the dipole moment also probably contributes to attract the negatively charged Pi group [29]. This substrate-binding pattern of hPHPT1 is quite different from those of protein serine/threonine phosphatases, protein tyrosine phosphatases and bacterial PHPT (SixA). It represents a new substrate recognition pattern in protein phosphatases.
Catalytic mechanism of hPHPT1

Figure 4

A proposed model for the catalytic mechanism of hPHPT1

The substrate binds to the protein by forming four H-bonds. His53 acts as a general base to activate a water molecule, which in turn functions as a nucleophile to attack the phosphate of the substrate. The positively charged amine group of Lys21 helps in stabilizing the transition state during catalysis.

As H53A mutant is the only inactive mutant, His53 should be the catalytic residue. The sulfur atom at the active site is  3.7 Å to the N1 atom of the His53 imidazole ring in the crystal structure 2NMM, and this distance is also appropriate for the imidazole to play a catalytic role. In general, a catalytic histidine can act as an attacking nucleophile, a general acid catalyst that protonates the leaving group or a general base that deprotonates a solvent molecule [30­32]. At the active site, the imidazole ring of His53 is located at the bottom of the substrate-binding cavity, and is unlikely to function as a general acid, since it is too far from the leaving group. If the histidine acts as a nucleophile, a phosphoenzyme intermediate would form during hPHPT1 catalysis, which can be detected by an inorganic Pi -water medium 18 O exchange experiment [33,34], whereas no intermediate would form if the histidine acts as a general base. We have performed the inorganic Pi -water medium 18 O exchange experiment, and the

result indicated that no covalent phospho-enzyme intermediate is formed for hPHPT1. It implies that the imidazole ring of His53 should not function as a nucleophile. That leaves the only possibility for the catalytic role of the imidazole ring, which should serve as a general base. In addition, we found that the chemical shifts of the side chain 1 1 1 2 15 2 H , H , N and 15 N1 of His53 do not change between pH 6.6 and 8.0 in Pi -free hPHPT1, indicating that the pK a value of the His53 imidazole ring should be below 5.6 (results not shown). Thus the imidazole ring of His53 is deprotonated at physiological pH, which is consistent with its role as a general base. In the crystal structure 2NMM, the sulfur atom at Site I is  3.7 Å to the side chain nitrogen atoms of His53 . This distance is appropriate for the imidazole ring to activate a water molecule, which in turn attacks the substrate phosphate as a nucleophile. As stated above, the K21A mutation greatly reduces kcat by  100-fold. In the structure ensembles of both Pi -free and Pi -bound hPHPT1, the side chains of Lys21 all point to the active site. In the crystal structure 2NMM, the amine group of Lys21 is  4.7 Å to the sulfate at Site I. Thus the positive charge of the Lys21 side chain probably plays an important role in stabilizing the transition state during the phosphoester bond cleavage due to electrostatic interaction with the substrate, as in the case of P-type ATPase [35]. The amine group of Lys21 is also close to the imidazole ring of His53 (4­5 Å), and the positive charge may also be a reason for the reduced pK a of the imidazole ring [36]. On the basis of the above analysis, we propose a catalytic mechanism for hPHPT1 (Figure 4): (i) the substrate binds to the protein by forming four H-bonds; (ii) His53 acts as a general base to activate a water molecule, which in turn functions as a nucleophile to attack the phosphate substrate; and (iii) the positively charged amine group of Lys21 helps in stabilizing the transition state during catalysis. The dipole moment of helix 1 may also help both substrate binding and substrate catalysis during the process. No metal ion is involved in this dephosphorylation reaction. This mechanism is different from those of protein phosphatases, including bacterial PHPT SixA, in which a histidine residue serves as a nucleophile to attack the substrate phosphate directly [37]. We have searched the EzCatDB database further [38­40] and find that no other phosphatases have a similar mechanism to that of hPHPT1.

Figure S5 Comparisons of the 2D 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra of mutant H102A (red) with that of the WT (blue) hPTP1 in Pi -free form
Peaks at 2 strand (Tyr22 ), 1 helix (Ile56 , Tyr57 and Asp58 ), loop 5 of the active site (Ser94 , Tyr97 and Gly98 ) and the C-terminus (Tyr125 ) exhibit significant shift in the spectra upon mutation of His102 to alanine, despite being fairly distant from His102 in the structure.
