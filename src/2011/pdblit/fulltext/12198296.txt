Porcine pancreatic elastase has been crystallized at slightly acidic pH under two similar but slightly different conditions. Ê Diffraction data were collected at a wavelength of 1.5 A to a Ê . Both difference electronmaximum resolution of 1.7 A density maps and anomalous difference electron-density maps suggest that in crystals grown from a sodium sulfate solution PPE binds Na+ in its metal-binding site. In contrast, PPE binds Ca2+ in crystals grown from a solution containing sodium citrate and calcium chloride. This observation is in contradiction to most PPE structures reported in the PDB. In addition to the metal-binding site, up to three other binding sites, which appear to be anion-binding sites, could be identi®ed based on the observed anomalous intensity differences.

1. Introduction
Porcine pancreatic elastase (EC 3.4.21.36) (PPE) is a serine protease homologous to trypsin and chymotrypsin (Hartley & Shotton, 1971). It consists of 240 amino acids cross-linked by four disul®de bridges and has been observed to bind to Ca2+ with a dissociation constant of 4.5 Â 10À5 M (Dimicoli & Bieth, 1977). PPE can be crystallized easily and is therefore used in many laboratories as a teaching example and a test case to investigate various crystallographic issues. On February 20, 2002, there were 42 entries for PPE in its canonical space group P212121 in the PDB (Berman et al., 2000). All of these appear to have been crystallized from a solution containing both sodium and sulfate. In 33 of these cases (PDB codes 1bma, 1btu, 1e34, 1e35, 1e36, 1e37, 1e38, 1ela, 1elb, 1elc, 1eld, 1ele, 1elf, 1elg, 1esb, 1h9l, 1hax, 1hay, 1haz, 1hb0, 1inc, 1lvy, 1nes, 1qgf, 1qix, 1qr3, 3est, 4est, 5est, 6est, 7est, 8est and 9est), the authors report that the metalbinding site is occupied by a calcium ion. Only in four cases was the metal reported to be sodium (PDB codes 1eas, 1eat, 1eau and 1qnj); in ®ve other cases, no metal was reported to be present in the binding site (PDB codes 1est, 1fzz, 1hv7, 1jim and 2est). In order to resolve this apparent discrepancy, we have crystallized PPE from a sodium sulfate solution as well as from a sulfate-free solution containing sodium citrate and calcium chloride (Gilliland et al., 1994). Based on the bond lengths to their neighbouring O atoms it is dif®cult to differentiate Na+ and Ca2+ (Harding, 1999, 2002), but with ten and 18 electrons, the two ions should appear differently in electron-density maps. However, occupancy values differing from 1.0 as well as variations in the atomic temperature factor may effectively mask this difference. Faced with a similar problem, Einspahr et al. (1985) managed to distinguish Mn2+ from Ca2+ in a crystal of pea lectin based on the anomalous intensity differences

² The values for Áf HH are based upon the theoretical approximation developed by Cromer & Liberman (1970). They were retrieved from the internet site of the Biomolecular Structure Center at the University of Washington, Seattle, USA (http:// www.bmsc.washington.edu/scatter/AS_periodic.html).

Ê observed at the absorption edge of manganese at ! = 1.896 A. In their case, the difference in Áf HH values between Mn2+ and Ca2+ was 2.2 e, which is about twice as large as the difference Ê between Na+ and Ca2+ at ! = 1.5 A (Table 1). Nevertheless, the fact that Áf HH of Na+ is almost negligible and that the ten S atoms present in the PPE structure may be used as an internal standard for the magnitude of the signal encouraged us to proceed along this direction. Based on highly redundant and therefore very accurate diffraction data sets from both PPE crystals, we are able to provide convincing evidence that PPE crystals grown from a sodium sulfate solution do not contain calcium, but contain sodium instead. If PPE crystals are grown from a solution containing a millimolar concentration of Ca2+ ions, however, the PPE metal-binding site is occupied by Ca2+ as expected. In the light of the fact that PPE crystals are often used as test cases (also in our laboratory), it is necessary to know with as much certainty as possible what elements are present in the crystal and bound to the protein. In this respect, our ®ndings may prove to be of wider interest.

2. Materials and methods
Commercially available porcine pancreatic elastase (Serva, Product No. 20929, Lot No. 13368) was used for crystallization without further puri®cation. The protein material was dissolved in deionized water to concentrations of 12 or 20 mg mlÀ1. For crystallization of the Na2SO4 crystal form, a 1 ml drop of protein solution (c = 20 mg mlÀ1) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 100 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.1 and 200 mM Na2SO4. The hanging drop was then equilibrated against this reservoir at room temperature. Crystal growth occurred within 1 or 2 d. For crystallization of the sodium citrate/CaCl2 form, a 1 ml drop of protein solution (c = 12 mg mlÀ1) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 100 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.1, 50 mM sodium citrate and 5 mM CaCl2. The hanging drop was ®rst incubated overnight at 298 K and then stored at room temperature. Crystal growth also occurred within 1 or 2 d. For data collection, both crystals were ¯ash-cooled in a nitrogen stream using dried paraf®n oil as a cryoprotectant (Riboldi-Tunnicliffe & Hilgenfeld, 1999). Complete and highly redundant data sets were collected from both crystal forms at EMBL beamline X31 (DESY Hamburg) at a wavelength of

Ê Ê 1.5 A to a maximum resolution of 1.7 A. For time and apparative reasons, we limited the maximum resolution for this Ê experiment to 1.7 A, although this was by no means the actual diffraction limit of the crystals. The data were processed using the program DENZO (Otwinowski, 1993) and scaled and merged using SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993). Intensities were converted to structure factors using the method of French & Wilson (1978) as implemented in the program TRUNCATE (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). By applying the TRUNCATE procedure, the observed structure-factor amplitudes were also placed on an approximate absolute scale. As a starting structure for re®nement, the PDB entry 1qnj Ê È (resolution 1.1 A, R factor = 12.7%; Wurtele et al., 2000) was used. All ions and solvent molecules were deleted from the

model, multiple conformations were reduced to the major conformation and all atomic temperature factors were set to be equal. After rigid-body re®nement and restrained re®nement of the protein atoms only, the anomalous difference electron density as well as the (Fobs À Fcalc) difference electron-density maps and the [Fobs(Ca) À Fobs(Na)] difference electron-density maps were computed. Further re®nement included the addition of ions and solvent molecules as well as manual inspection of the model using computer graphics. All re®nement and electron-density map calculations were performed using programs from the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994).

3. Results and discussion
Some details of data collection and processing are given in Table 2. From the numbers, it is evident that both collected data sets are of very high quality. The values obtained for the optical resolution corroborate the notion that the actual diffraction limit of the crystals used was actually much higher Ê than 1.7 A, as pointed out previously in x2. In the case of the Na2SO4 crystal form, the b* axis was oriented almost parallel to the spindle axis. This precluded the achievement of a

comparable completeness as for the sodium citrate/CaCl2 form using rotation about just one axis. Therefore, after 300 of rotation the orientation was changed by about 10 and another 100 of data were collected to cover the blind region. The data set for the Na2SO4 crystal form appears to be of slightly higher quality based on the observed merging statistics (Table 2). The anomalous differences as described by Ranom are very small in both cases as expected, but they are slightly larger than the errors in the merged intensities, as described by Rp.i.m.. This appears to be a good indicator of the quality of the anomalous differences (Weiss et al., 2001; Panjikar & Tucker, 2002). It is also apparent that the sodium citrate/CaCl2 data exhibits a larger anomalous signal than the Na2SO4 data. In order to avoid any bias caused by the presence of solvent molecules or ions in the structures, the difference electrondensity maps and the anomalous difference electron-density maps were calculated after rigid-body and restrained re®nement of the protein atoms only. The R and Rfree values at this stage were 26.3 and 30.7% for the Na2SO4 data and 26.1 and 30.3% for the sodium citrate/CaCl2 data, respectively. Even though the difference in the Áf HH values for Na and Ca at the Ê wavelength ! = 1.5 A is only about 1.1 e (Table 1), the anomalous difference electron-density maps of the two data sets appear very different at the metal-binding site (Fig. 1). The absolute and relative heights as well as the ranks of the top peaks in the four maps are listed in Table 3. It is important to note that the anomalous difference electron-density maps have different root-mean-square (r.m.s.) values. Therefore, all

peaks appear to be higher in the Na2SO4 case when viewed in units of r.m.s. If one considers the absolute peak heights, however, it becomes clear that this is not the case and that the peak heights for the S atoms are indeed of the same magnitude in both maps. From the lists of peaks in the various electrondensity maps, it is evident that PPE contains a total of four major binding sites: a metal-binding site, an anion-binding site near Ser14 (anion-I), a second anion-binding site in the active site near Ser188 (anion-II) and a sulfate-binding site at a crystal contact between Arg136 and Arg225 of a symmetryrelated molecule (anion-III) (Fig. 1).

The metal-binding site of PPE. The metal site is shown in red, the traces of loop 58±70 in grey and the atoms of the amino acids and water molecules coordinating the metal in dark blue (Na2SO4 complex) and light blue (sodium citrate/CaCl2 complex). The two structures were superimposed so that the metal coordinates are identical in both cases. This ®gure was also prepared using the programs MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) and Raster3D (Merritt & Bacon, 1997).

As indicated by the re®nement statistics (Table 2) both PPE structures are of very good quality. With Rfree factors close to 20%, the structures can be considered to be well re®ned. The relatively large number of ordered water molecules re¯ects the precision and the quality of the data on the one hand, but may also be a consequence of the fact that hydrophobic paraf®n oil is used as a cryoprotectant rather than a hydrophilic compound such as glycerol.
3.2. The metal-binding site

The metal bound to PPE is coordinated by amino-acid residues located on loop 59±69. The participating groups are the carboxylate groups of Glu59, Asp66 and Glu69 as well as

the main-chain carbonyl O atoms of Asn61 and Gln64, and one water molecule. In the difference electron-density maps of the sodium citrate/CaCl2 crystal form, the peak height at this site is signi®cantly higher than anywhere else, whereas in the Na2SO4 crystal form it is about the same as for the water molecules. In the anomalous difference density maps of the Na2SO4 crystal form, the peak height at the metal site is only about one third of the height of the sulfur peaks, whereas in the sodium citrate/CaCl2 crystal form it is again considerably higher. These observations suggest that PPE binds mainly Ca2+ in the sodium citrate/CaCl2 crystal form and mainly Na+ in the Na2SO4 case. Owing to the correlation between occupancy and temperature factor, it is dif®cult to estimate accurate occupancy values from these peak heights, but using the average sulfur peak height as internal standard and assuming that the metal site is in both cases occupied by a mixture of Na+ and Ca2+, the Na+ occupancy in the Na2SO4 case is close to 100%, whereas the Ca2+ occupancy in the sodium citrate/ CaCl2 case is at least 60%. Taking the peak height of the strongest water molecule as a standard for the (Fobs À Fcalc) difference maps, very similar values are obtained. The coordination of the cation is almost ideally octahedral, allowing both ions to bind (Fig. 2). However, in the case of Ca2+ the second carboxylate O atom of Glu59 moves slightly towards the metal ion mainly by a rotation of the side chain around 12 by about 10 . This movement pushes the coordiÊ nating water molecule (Water 112) about 0.9 A away from the carboxylate and distorts the octahedron somewhat in the direction of a pentagonal bipyramid, which is the preferred coordination geometry for Ca2+ (Harding, 1999). Overall, the ion-to-ligand atom distances (Table 4) are shorter for the Ca2+ case, which lends additional support to our interpretation. The binding of the different metals does not cause any signi®cant structural rearrangement in PPE. The r.m.s. deviation between the two structures based on all 240 C Ê atoms is about 0.07 A, which is clearly below the expected coordinate error. This observation is also in accord with the fact that neither the binding of Na+ nor of Ca2+ has a major in¯uence on the catalytic activity of the enzyme (Hartley & Shotton, 1971).
Acta Cryst. (2002). D58, 1407±1412

Our ®ndings with respect to the identity of the metal ion are in contrast with most of the PPE structures in the PDB. In the ®rst high-resolution structure of PPE in the PDB (PDB code Ê 1est, resolution 2.5 A; Sawyer et al., 1978), the electron-density peak at the metal-binding site was interpreted as a water molecule because it was of similar strength to peaks for internal water molecules. However, the possibility of Ca2+ binding was mentioned. In later structures (PDB codes 1nes Ê and 3est, resolution 1.65 A; Meyer et al., 1986, 1988), Ca2+ binding was reported, with a reference to Dimicoli & Bieth (1977), although the PPE crystals were grown under the same conditions. Since the 3est coordinates were used as starting structure in most subsequent PPE structure analyses, we suspect that the presence of Ca2+ in 3est led to the presence of Ca2+ in later PPE structures. Considering the thermodynamic equilibrium constants (4.5 Â 10À5 M for the dissociation constant of the PPE±Ca2+ complex and 9.1 Â 10À6 M for the solubility product of CaSO4), it appears unlikely that any Ca2+ can be left bound to PPE when sodium sulfate is used as a precipitant. We therefore believe that most of the PPE structures in the PDB need to be revised with respect to the identity of the bound metal ion.
3.3. The ion-binding site near Ser14

An unexpected feature was detected in the various anomalous and difference electron-density maps suggesting the presence of an ion near Ser14. The coordination is tetrahedral with the coordinating atoms being Ser14 OG, Ser14 N and two water molecules. Since this peak is almost spherical, we interpret it as a chloride ion. The presence of chloride in both cases can be explained by the fact that hydrochloric acid was used to adjust the pH of the acetate buffer. We have no explanation, however, of why this feature appears to be stronger in the Na2SO4 case than in the sodium citrate/CaCl2 case.
3.4. The sulfate/acetate-binding site in the active site near Ser188

Another anion-binding site has been detected close to the active-site serine Ser188. In the Na2SO4 crystal form this anion is clearly a sulfate ion (although probably not 100% occupied), whereas in the sodium citrate/CaCl2 form it is an acetate ion from the buffer. The two O atoms of the acetate assume almost identical positions to two of the O atoms of the sulfate ion.
3.5. The sulfate-binding site between Arg136 and Arg225

At a crystal contact a sulfate ion is bound to the Na2SO4 crystal form. This sulfate is of course not present in the sodium citrate/CaCl2 crystal form.

Na2SO4-containing solution the metal-binding site of PPE is occupied by a sodium ion, whereas if PPE crystals are grown from a sodium citrate/CaCl2-containing solution the metalbinding site of PPE contains mainly a calcium ion. The binding of the different metals is accompanied by only a slight rearrangement of the amino-acid residues building up the metalbinding site. Overall, the two structures are very similar. Three further binding sites have been identi®ed in PPE: one chloride-binding site near Ser14, one sulfate/acetate-binding site in the active site and one sulfate-binding site between two Arg residues at a crystal contact. In which respects our ®ndings for PPE may be relevant to other metal-containing protein structures we do not know. It is clear, however, that great care must be taken to ensure that the bound metal is identi®ed properly from the diffraction data and if necessary also by other means.
