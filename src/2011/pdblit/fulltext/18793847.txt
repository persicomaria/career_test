We identified the class of dihydropteridinones as Plk1 inhibitors that were then further tailored for potency, selectivity, and ability to modulate Plk1 in proliferating cells. The dihydropteridinone BI 2536 (Figure 1A) blocked human Plk1 with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.83 nM (Figure S2) and equipotently blocked mouse and rat Plk1. This compound showed a more than 1000-fold selectivity relative to a panel of 63 other protein kinases (Table S1), but it also affected the activities of Plk2 at an IC50 of 3.5 nM and, to a slightly lesser extent, the activity of Plk3 (IC50 9.0 nM). For technical reasons, we have not been able to assess the effect of BI 2536 on Plk4, a kinase showing only limited homology to Plk1 in its kinase domain [5]. Taken together, these results show that BI 2536 potently and selectively inhibits Plk1 in vitro. The effect of BI 2536 on the cell-cycle profile of cancer cells grown in vitro was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Exceeding a 100-fold concentration range starting at 10 nM, BI 2536 caused HeLa cells to accumulate with a 4N DNA content (Figure 1B), indicative of a cell-cycle block in either G2 phase or mitosis. To assess specific cellular effects of BI 2536, we treated HeLa cells with increasing doses for 2 hr and processed them for a-tubulin immunofluorescence. Again, first cell-cycle effects were observed at 10 nM, whereas at concentrations as low as 25 nM, anaphase and telophase figures were absent and we observed accumulation of mitotic cells with aberrant spindles (Figure 1C). Remarkably, at 50 nM concentration, the appearance and distribution of phenotypes was almost identical to those observed upon treatment with Plk1 RNAi (Figures 1C and 1D) [6, 7]. The most prominent and severe phenotype in both RNAi and inhibitor-treated samples were monopolar spindles, which we refer to as ``Polo'' spindles, circled by a ring of chromosomes (Figure 1D) [6­8]. A homogenous population of monopolar ``Polo'' spindles was observed at 100 nM and concentrations of up to 1 mM (Figures 1C and 1D). We examined the effects of BI 2536 on cell-cycle progression and apoptosis in synchronized HeLa cultures by determining the DNA content and induction of cleaved PARP p85 fragments, respectively (Figure 1E). HeLa cells released into regular culture media progressed through S and G2/M and then reentered G1 phase with no evidence of apoptosis (Figure 1E, left panels). In contrast, cells released into media with 60 nM BI 2536 progressed through S phase normally and then arrested in G2/M. Between 24 and 48 hr after release, these cells showed a sub-G1 DNA peak, indicative of DNA breakdown and apoptosis, and they accumulated cleaved PARP p85 fragments (Figure 1E, right panels); this finding is consistent with the reported effects of Plk1 RNAi in cancer cells [7, 9]. It was recently reported that Plk1 RNAi only results in a strong mitotic arrest in cancer cells but not in

Summary Fine-mapping of the cell-division cycle, notably the identification of mitotic kinase signaling pathways, provides novel opportunities for cancer-drug discovery. As a key regulator of multiple steps during mitotic progression across eukaryotic species, the serine/ threonine-specific Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is highly expressed in malignant cells and serves as a negative prognostic marker in specific human cancer types [1­4]. Here, we report the discovery of a potent small-molecule inhibitor of mammalian Plk1, BI 2536, which inhibits Plk1 enzyme activity at low nanomolar concentrations. The compound potently causes a mitotic arrest and induces apoptosis in human cancer cell lines of diverse tissue origin and oncogenome signature. BI 2536 inhibits growth of human tumor xenografts in nude mice and induces regression of large tumors with well-tolerated intravenous dose regimens. In treated tumors, cells arrest in prometaphase, accumulate phosphohistone H3, and contain aberrant mitotic spindles. This mitotic arrest is followed by a surge in apoptosis, detectable by immunohistochemistry and noninvasive optical and magnetic resonance imaging. For addressing the therapeutic potential of Plk1 inhibition, BI 2536 has progressed into clinical studies in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancers. Results and Discussion Based on the essential role of Plk1 during mitosis of all proliferating cells, as well as its enriched expression in human cancer tissues (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online), we screened

BI 2536 Induces Mitotic Arrest and Subsequent Apoptosis in Human Cells (A) Chemical structure of the ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor, BI 2536, derived from a novel chemical series, the dihydro-pteridinones (WO 03/020722). (B) FACS profile of exponentially growing HeLa-S3 cells treated for 24 hr by BI 2536 with concentrations ranging 10 nM­1 mM. Cells accumulate 4N DNA content, indicative of G2/M arrest. The mitotic figures observed in BI 2536-treated cultures of HeLa cells displayed abnormal mitotic figures at EC50 values closely matching the induction of a G2/M arrest (data not shown). Note that the 8N peak reflects cell aggregates rather than induction of binucleated cells. (C) HeLa cells treated with increasing concentrations of BI 2536 for 2 hr, fixed, and stained for a-tubulin and DNA for identification of mitotic stages. Mitotic arrest is evident already at concentrations of 25 nM, and phenotype stabilizes at 100 nM with monopolar ``Polo'' spindles typical for Plk1 inhibition. n = 100 for each.

The scale bar represents 10 mm. (E) HeLa S3 cells synchronized at the G1/S transition by thymidine treatment were incubated with 60 nM BI 2536. At the time points indicated, cells were analyzed by FACS and by western blotting for cleaved PARP p85 fragments. Starting at 24 hr, a strong signal for fragmented DNA and cleaved PARP is detected, indicative of apoptosis. (F) Immunofluorescence analysis of hTERT-RPE1 cells reveals almost identical dose response to HeLa cells. Cells were analyzed as for (C), n = 100 for each.

noncancer cell lines [10]. To analyze the effects of BI 2536 in nontransformed cycling cells, we tested the compound in hTERT-RPE1 cells, a noncancer human retinal pigment epithelial cell line that has been immortalized by stable expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase [11]. We observed a dose response with a distribution of phenotypes that was very similar to the one seen in HeLa cells (Figure 1F). At 100 nM, approximately 70% of mitotic cells showed a typical ``Polo'' phenotype, whereas the remaining approximately 30% were arrested with aberrant spindles lacking focused poles and containing unaligned chromosomes (Figure 1G). In addition to HeLa cells, BI 2536 potently inhibited the proliferation of a panel of 32 human cancer cell lines, representing diverse organ derivations (including carcinomas of the breast, colon, lung, pancreas, and prostate, melanomas, and hematopoietic cancers) and varied

patterns of tumor suppressor or oncogene mutations (including RB1, TP53, PTEN, and KRAS status) (Figure 2). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values in this cell panel ranged 2­25 nM, whereas a concentration of 100 nM of BI 2536 was typically sufficient for inducing a complete mitotic arrest, as described above for HeLa cells. The proliferation of exponentially growing hTERT-RPE1, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and normal rat kidney (NRK) cells was blocked at EC50 values ranging 12­31 nM, indicating a comparable sensitivity of cycling nontransformed cells to BI 2536. The multitargeted inhibitor ON01910 [12] was, at one point, considered to affect not only Cdk1 and various tyrosine kinases but also Plk1 function [13]. We therefore compared the effects of this compound to the effects of BI 2536. However, in our Plk1 in vitro kinase assay, ON01910 showed no inhibition up to a concentration

of 30 mM. Although the compound effectively blocked cell proliferation of Hela S3 cells at an EC50 of 45 nM, we were unable to find a concentration range in these cells where phenotypes were observed that were reminiscent of Plk1 RNAi: Multipolar spindles but no monopolar asters were detected, (Figure S3A), and g-tubulin recruitment was not efficiently blocked (Figures S3A and S3B). The cellular effects caused by ON01910 resembled the phenotype that is caused by treatment with low doses of microtubule depolymerizing agents rather than Plk1 RNAi. Supporting this notion, depolymerization of microtubules was clearly visible in interphase cells when these were treated with higher doses of ON01910 (Figure S3C). Thus, our data suggest that Plk1 is not inhibited efficiently by ON01910 in human cells, and this is in agreement with the undetectable inhibition of Plk1 in vitro. Taking into account the unknown specificity of other recently published compounds

[14, 15], our results suggest that BI 2536 is the first potent and selective Plk1 inhibitor that induces all hallmarks of Plk1 inhibition. We next examined the ability of BI 2536, given by intravenous (i.v.) injection, to block the growth of human cancer xenografts in immunodeficient, nu/nu mice. Consecutive cycles of 40­50 mg/kg BI 2536 given i.v. once or twice per week were found to be highly efficacious in diverse xenograft models, such as the HCT 116 colon cancer with complete tumor suppression with the twice per week schedule (treated versus the control (T/C) value 0.3%) and a T/C value of 16% with once per week treatment (Figure 3A); both schedules were well-tolerated, as judged by clinical signs and absence of major bodyweight changes (Figure S4). By using a more rigorous model of larger HCT 116 tumors, in which treatment was delayed until cancer nodules reached a median size of 500 mm3, we found that five cycles of BI 2536

Tumor-Growth Inhibition by Plk1 Inhibitor BI 2536 319

induced marked tumor regressions, whereas the control mice showed progressive disease (Figure 3B). The efficacy of BI 2536 was further studied in a pancreas-carcinoma model, BxPC-3, and a non-small-cell lung-cancer model, A549. By using the twice-weekly i.v. schedule with four to seven cycles, we observed excellent tumor-growth inhibition with T/C values of 5% and 14%, respectively, in these two models (Figures 3C and 3D), again with good tolerability. The high selectivity of BI 2536 and the pattern of mitotic changes in BI 2536-treated cancer-cell cultures suggest that the observed in vivo anticancer activity is mediated by Plk1 inhibition. In line with this notion, we have extended the biomarker studies of BI 2536 to the in vivo setting. By employing immunohistochemical methods, we found that BI 2536 inhibits the growth of NCI-H460 lung carcinomas in nu/nu mice with a concomitant increase in mitotic index and upregulation of histone H3 phosphorylation (Figure 3E, top panels). As measured by TUNEL staining on tissue sections, massive tumor-cell apoptosis occurred approximately 48 hr after initiation of BI 2536 therapy (Figure 3E, bottom panels). With a view toward potential future clinical investigations in cancer patients, the biomarker studies were corroborated by imaging methods suitable for noninvasive and repeated in vivo monitoring, namely optical nearinfrared imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For optical imaging, we used the fluorescent dye, Cy5.5, coupled to annexin V as a noninvasive in vivo probe for apoptosis [16, 17] and monitored BI 2536 effects in the NCI-H460 lung-cancer model. As shown in Figure 4A, we could readily visualize the surge in apoptosis in the animal soon after initiation of treatment. As a second approach, we employed noninvasive, diffusion-weighted MRI scans to monitor changes in the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADCw) as a sensitive and reliable indicator of changes in the tumor microenvironment [18, 19]. For these experiments, the HCT 116 colon-cancer model was used with the fully effective twice weekly i.v. regimen of BI 2536 (Figure 4B). Images and calculated ADCw values identified structural changes in the tumors due to progressive apoptosis starting on day 4 of the experiment, in agreement with the results from immunohistochemistry and optical imaging. Collectively, our in vivo results indicate that BI 2536 not only inhibits cell proliferation by a mitotic arrest but also subsequently induces tumor-cell death, consistent with the observation that this compound can induce tumor regressions. Because all defective signaling pathways in a cancer cell ultimately affect cell-cycle progression, a possible approach for cancer therapy is to develop inhibitors that block the function of a key element that is required by cells to complete cell division. Functionally, Plk1 falls into this group of targets including Aurora kinases [20, 21], which are specifically activated during mitosis and highly expressed in human cancer tissues. In contrast to Aurora kinases, little progress has been reported toward potent and selective Plk1 inhibitors with drug-like properties suited to clinical development. This initial report on BI 2536, a Plk1 inhibitor from a novel chemical series with attractive drug-like features, supports four

conclusions. First, it is chemically possible to generate a Plk1 inhibitor with potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties suitable for clinical investigation in cancer patients: Initial results of BI 2536 administration in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancers have been reported [22]. Second, mechanistic studies with human cancer cells in vitro show that all of the cellular phenotypes that we have observed can be fully explained by the ability of BI 2536 to inhibit Plk1. Third, BI 2536 is highly effective in cancer xenograft models in mice with acceptable tolerability. Finally, we have profiled a number of preclinical, pharmacodynamic markers, including noninvasive imaging technologies, which may help to identify future clinical biomarkers for Plk1 inhibitors. The results provide a clear rationale that inhibition of Plk1 constitutes a new therapeutic approach and holds the potential to induce regressions of a diverse range of cancer types. Even if BI 2536 appears to be an extremely potent and selective inhibitor of Plk1, we have observed inhibition of Plk2 and Plk3 in vitro kinase activity at slightly higher concentrations of BI 2536. Plk2 and Plk3 are not specifically expressed in proliferating cells, are thought to function in G1 and S phases of the cell cycle, and do not appear to play a direct role in mitotic regulation [1, 2, 4]. To address the specificity of BI 2536 treatment in human cells, we compared its effects to published Plk1 RNAi and Plk1 antibody injection experiments [6, 7, 23, 24]. We found very positive correlations for all phenotypes tested. BI 2536 mirrored effects of Plk1 RNAi in blocking the recruitment of g-tubulin and phosphorylation of Apc6 at mitotic centrosomes, inhibition of cohesin release from chromosome arms, induction of monopolar spindles, as well as a range of other mitotic processes that are known to depend on Plk1 (see [25]; this issue of Current Biology). The facts that hallmarks of Plk1 inhibition appeared and stabilized in a narrow concentration range (10­100 nM) and no additional effects were observed up to 1 mM further support the specificity of this inhibitor. Plk1 inhibitors such as BI 2536 may have significant advantages over existing antimitotic approaches (such as taxanes and vinca alkaloids) that are directed at microtubules. The use of these latter agents can be constrained by dose-limiting toxicities related to the broad requirement for tubulin in critical cellular processes unrelated to mitosis. Unlike tubulin, Plk1 is only expressed in proliferating cells and appears to have no major role in cellular processes outside of mitosis. Based on Plk1's essential and exquisite role during mitosis of all proliferating cells, an inhibitor would target all rapidly dividing cells, irrespective of their sets of tumor suppressor or oncogene mutations, yet avoid some of the side effects associated with current antimitotic agents.
