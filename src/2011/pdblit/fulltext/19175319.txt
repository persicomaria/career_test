A major problem associated with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) for the treatment of HIV is their lack of resilience to mutations in the reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme. Using structural overlays of the known inhibitors efavirenz and capravirine complexed in RT as a starting point, and structurebased drug design techniques, we have created a novel series of indazole NNRTIs that possess excellent metabolic stability and mutant resilience.
Introduction Approximately 33 million people are living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, and 2.5 million people were newly infected with the virus in 2007.1 HIV slowly attacks and destroys the immune system, leaving an individual open to other infections that eventually result in death. There is no cure for HIV infection, but a number of drugs slow or halt disease progression. However, HIV can rapidly become resistant to any single antiretroviral drug, therefore a combination of three or more drugs are usually required to effectively suppress the virus. This is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Reverse transcriptase (RTa) is an essential enzyme in the infectious lifecycle of HIV, and inhibition of this enzyme has shown utility in the treatment of HIV. Several inhibitors of RT are used as components of HAART. However, established drugs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), which bind to an allosteric pocket outside the catalytic site, are particularly vulnerable to the development of viral resistance

caused by mutations in RT that can retain viable enzymatic function. The so-called first-generation NNRTIs such as nevirapine, delavirdine, and efavirenz (Figure 1) are very susceptible to single-point resistance mutations within RT and therefore significant efforts in this field have focused on developing second-generation NNRTIs with an improved mutant profile.2 For example, treatment with efavirenz, the market leader in this class, can result in drug resistant virus due to the emergence of the K103N mutation in the NNRTI binding pocket of the enzyme.3 Etravirine (Figure 1) is a recently launched secondgeneration NNRTI drug that retains activity against the clinically relevant mutations of RT, particularly K103N and Y181C.4 However, there is still a need for additional novel chemical substrate that provides opportunities for delivering broad spectrum activity against mutant HIV. Our key aim has been the design and development of novel and potent NNRTIs that retain potent activity (within 10-fold of wild-type) against the most clinically relevant mutations, particularly K103N, thus reducing their intrinsic susceptibility to these mutations. Capravirine (Figure 1) is a second-generation NNRTI which exhibits an improvement over the marketed NNRTIs with regard to its spectrum of activity against drug-resistant strains of HIV, including K103N.5 We decided that capravirine was an appropriate starting point for our design of novel NNRTIs due to its excellent mutant profile and we reasoned that a hybrid of the well-established efavirenz template with that of capravirine (molecular hybridization6), facilitated by structure-based drug

design, could create a novel starting point which may furnish analogues with the desired potency and resilience to RT mutations. Synthetic Chemistry At the outset, we desired a facile and reliable method for the preparation of 4-aryloxyindazoles, which would allow us to prepare a variety of related analogues in this series. Our strategy for their preparation involved the arylation of 4-hydroxy indazoles using an electron-deficient aryl fluoride as the key step. Treatment of the known 4-hydroxyindazole 97 with commercially available 3,5-dicyanofluorobenzene provided the desired adduct 1 in modest yield (Scheme 1). Chlorination and fluorination of 1 provided derivatives 5 and 6, respectively (structures confirmed by NOE and C-H correlation NMR experiments: see Supporting Information). Similar chemistry was used to prepare the 3-ethyl indazole derivatives (Scheme 2). Treatment of the known resorcinol 108 with hydrazine at high temperature effected transformation to indazole 11. Arylation provided 2, and fluorination of this derivative yielded 7. Further modifications to the 3-position of the indazole were readily achieved by radical bromination of derivative 12, which was reacted with methylamine and methanol to provide 3 and 4, respectively (Scheme 3). Modification of the 7-position of the indazole was realized using a selective bromination of 1, (14 structure confirmed by NOE: see Supporting Information), followed by a Stille reaction to install the ethylene group, followed by oxidative cleavage and reduction of the resulting aldehyde to provide derivative 8 (Scheme 4). Commercially available 3-indazolinone 15 was arylated with 3,5-dicyanofluorobenzene (in the same manner as 9) to furnish 16 (Scheme 5). Target Design Our starting point was an analysis of the published X-ray cocrystal structures of efavirenz and capravirine with RT to investigate the relation between structure and function. The

capravirine-RT complex (1EP4, Supporting Information), described previously by Stuart and Stammers, sheds light on the structural components responsible for its resilience to drug resistant mutations.9 A key feature is the hydrogen bonding network capravirine makes with the peptide backbone of the NNRTI allosteric binding pocket. Two of these hydrogen bonds are between the carbamate group and the peptide main chain of residues K103 and P236. A third bond is formed between N3 of capravirine and the main chain of residue K101, which is mediated by a bridging water molecule. Interestingly, both the N-H and carbonyl groups of the cyclic carbamate substituent of efavirenz form direct hydrogen bonds with the K101 main chain atoms (1FKO, Supporting Information) without the need for a bridging water.10 Another key attribute of the capravirine-RT structure is an optimized edge-to-face -interaction between the 3,5-dichlorophenyl substituent of capravirine and the indole moiety of the highly conserved residue W229. Indeed, the rational design of NNRTIs to interact specifically with W229 to improve mutant resilience has also been suggested by Balzarini and De Clercq11 and was recently utilized in the development of pyrrolobenzoxazepine NNRTIs by Campiani and co-workers.12 A crystallographic overlay of efavirenz and capravirine within the binding site is shown in Figure 2. This overlay nicely illustrates the key differences between these NNRTIs in the location and nature of the group, which occupies the lipophilic pocket created by W229, Y188, and Y181 in the allosteric binding site. Our initial aim was to transpose the 3,5-disubsituted phenyl moiety present in capravirine to a novel bicyclic template (similar to but distinct

from the dihydrobenzoxazinone template of efavirenz), while ensuring the -interaction with the immutable W229 residue could be retained. In particular, we were keen to avoid the chiral center present in efavirenz, thus reducing synthetic complexity, so the indazole template appeared to be ideally suited for our purposes because it could satisfy these structural criteria (Figure 3). Additionally, the N-H moiety of the indazole should undergo hydrogen bonding with the main chain of residue K101, similar to that in the efavirenz complex. Results and Discussion From the structural overlap shown in Figure 2, we noticed that the most favorable position for the incorporation of the 3,5disubstituted benzene moiety into the indazole template would be the 4-position as this is closest to the location of this group in capravirine. For synthetic expedience, the first analogue we prepared in this series was 1 (Scheme 1). We have previously shown that a 3,5-dicyanophenoxy group can be incorporated into NNRTIs,13 and amenable synthetic chemistry facilitated its incorporation into the indazole template. In fact, the replacement of the hydrophobic chlorine atoms with nitrile moieties (LogP  -2 from Rekker fragments)14 and removing the metabolically vulnerable sulfur atom with the more polar oxygen, creates a more "druggable" starting point for our design due to the expected improvements in metabolic stability and solubility associated with reducing lipophilicity (see below).15 Pleasingly, 1 possessed encouraging potency against wildtype RT (Table 1). To test the importance of the location of this moiety in the indazole template, we appended this group to the 3-position to provide 16, but this derivative is approximately 100-fold less potent than 1 (wild-type RT IC50 38 µM), thus illustrating the usefulness of the structural overlays. However, we found that 1 formed a reactive metabolite conjugate that could be trapped with glutathione following incubation with human liver microsomes (HLMs), a feature that has been linked with hepato- and idiosyncratic toxicity.16 Although the structure of this conjugate was not further characterized, there is an obvious similarity with 3-methyl indole, which exhibits toxicity due to H-atom abstraction from the methyl group, followed by single electron oxidation to form the electrophilic imine-methide.17 We reasoned that alternative

groups at the 3-position of the indazole would avoid reactive metabolite formation by this mechanism. From the structural overlaps shown in Figure 2, we also noticed that a group here would overlap well with the CF3-substituent in efavirenz and the isopropyl group in the 4-position of capravirine. Indeed, increasing the size of this substituent from a methyl to an ethyl group to provide 2 not only increased the potency 3-fold (Table 1), 2 was also negative in the reactive metabolite assay. Further elaboration of this substituent was pursued due to synthetic tractability, but we quickly discovered that increasing the size of this substituent even further resulted in significant potency reductions (3 and 4). Additionally, from the crystallographic overlay in Figure 2, it was apparent that a hydrophobic group in the 5-position of the indazole would overlap well with the chloro-subsitituent in efavirenz. Interestingly, a chlorine atom at this position had minimal effect on potency (Table 1, compound 5), but the smaller fluorine substituent improved the potency nearly 7-fold (compound 6: see below for an explanation). Incorporating an ethyl group into the 3-position to provide 7 further improved the potency as we expected. Additionally, both 6 and 7 were negative in the reactive metabolite assay. We were then able to cocrystallize 6, as a representative from this series, with K103N RT as shown in Figure 4.18 Derivative 6 makes the important edge-to-face -interactions with the immutable W229 residue, and the indazole N-H undergoes a hydrogen bond with the peptide main chain of residue K101, thus satisfying both design features that were in our original plan.19 The benzene ring also appears to make a face-to-face -interaction with the Y188 residue, an interaction that has also been reported recently by Tucker and co-workers for a series of meta-cyanophenoxy-containing NNRTI derivatives.20 Table 2 shows the potency of derivatives 6 and 7 against the clinically relevant K103N and Y181C RT mutations (we have included efavirenz and capravirine for reference). Their balanced mutant profile (potencies within 10-fold of wild-type) and potent antiviral activity vindicates our original strategy. Interestingly, the highly mutable residue Y181 adopts a "down" position (Figure 4), analogous to a series of benzophenone NNRTIs recently reported by Stammers and co-workers, which appears to result from a steric clash between the meta-substituent on the A ring and the Y181 tyrosine. The resilience of these derivatives to the Y181C mutation may be due to a reduction in the aromatic stacking interactions with this residue, and that

augment resilience to mutations in RT. The 7-position of the indazole would appear to be the optimal location for a hydrogenbonding group and derivative 8, which contains a hydroxymethyl substituent at this position, displays a significant improvement in potency over 1 (5-fold, Table 1). Interestingly, this derivative is >10-fold less potent against K103N (Table 2), unlike compounds 6 and 7, and therefore optimization of the peptide-backbone hydrogen-bonding capacity would be required to address the apparent mutant vulnerability in this strategy. Compound 8 also retained excellent in vitro metabolic stability in human liver microsomes (Table 2). Metabolic stability was also assessed in vitro in human hepatocytes (HHeps), which retain phase 2 metabolic capabilities. Unfortunately, 8 was found to have poor stability in hepatocytes relative to 6 and 7 (Table 2) and therefore this derivative did not warrant further profiling. Conclusion We have used molecular hybridization of existing NNRTIs to efficiently create a new series of indazole derivatives that possess potent activity against both wild-type and clinically relevant mutations of the RT enzyme. Specifically, compounds 6 and 7, fashioned using structure-based drug design, also possess potent antiviral activity and retain excellent in vitro metabolic stability. Because of the expense of HAART therapy, we have also addressed potential cost of goods issues in our design from the outset by pursuing a synthetically expedient series, which avoids chiral centers. These studies provide a proof-of-concept for the utility of molecular hybridization in the creation of novel leads as inhibitors of RT. Further development of this series will be reported in due course. Experimental Section

efficient binding can still be achieved due to optimized interactions elsewhere (for example, the edge-to-face -bond with W229).21 The conformation of compound 6 shown in Figure 4 was used as a template to generate an energy minimized structure for the chloro-derivative 5 (see Experimental Section), and the indazole rings of compounds 5 and 6 were then overlaid (Figure 5). As one might predict, the larger chlorine atom causes a flip and twist of the phenoxy group away from the halogen, implying that the conformation required for optimal binding is sterically less favored for 5 and may explain why this derivative is less potent than 6. We also noticed the potential for incorporating hydrogenbonding groups into the benzene ring of the indazole template to mimic the carbamate substituent present in capravirine, which is apparent in the overlay shown in Figure 2. We felt these additional interactions may not only improve potency, but also
