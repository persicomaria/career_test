Crystal structure of the e subunit of the proton-translocating ATP synthase from Escherichia coli
Ulla Uhlin1, Graeme B Cox2 and J Mitchell Guss1*
Background: Proton-translocating ATP synthases convert the energy generated from photosynthesis or respiration into ATP. These enzymes, termed F0F1-ATPases, are structurally highly conserved. In Escherichia coli, F0F1-ATPase consists of a membrane portion, F0, made up of three different polypeptides (a, b and c) and an F1 portion comprising five different polypeptides in the stoichiometry 33. The minor subunits ,  and  are required for the coupling of proton translocation with ATP synthesis; the  subunit is in close contact with the , ,  and c subunits. The structure of the  subunit provides clues to its essential role in this complex enzyme. Results: The structure of the E. coli F0F1-ATPase  subunit has been solved at 2.3 Å resolution by multiple isomorphous replacement. The structure, comprising residues 2­136 of the polypeptide chain and 14 water molecules, refined to an R value of 0.214 (Rfree = 0.288). The molecule has a novel fold with two domains. The N-terminal domain is a  sandwich with two fivestranded sheets. The C-terminal domain is formed from two  helices arranged in an antiparallel coiled-coil. A series of alanine residues from each helix form the central contacting residues in the helical domain and can be described as an `alanine zipper'. There is an extensive hydrophobic contact region between the two domains providing a stable interface. The individual domains of the crystal structure closely resemble the structures determined in solution by NMR spectroscopy. Conclusions: Sequence alignments of a number of  subunits from diverse sources suggest that the C-terminal domain, which is absent in some species, is not essential for function. In the crystal the N-terminal domains of two  subunits make a close hydrophobic interaction across a crystallographic twofold axis. This region has previously been proposed as the contact surface between the  and  subunits in the complete F1-ATPase complex. In the crystal structure, we observe what is apparently a stable interface between the two domains of the  subunit, consistent with the fact that the crystal and solution structures are quite similar despite close crystal packing. This suggests that a gross conformational change in the  subunit, to transmit the effect of proton translocation to the catalytic domain, is unlikely, but cannot be ruled out.

Introduction
The proton-translocating F0F1-ATP synthases, located in mitochondrial, chloroplast and bacterial membranes, catalyse the final step in oxidative or photophosphorylation. There are a number of excellent reviews on the structure and mechanism of the ATP synthase [1­3]. The same enzymes can also catalyse ATP driven proton translocation and in this role are termed ATPases. The structure of F0F1-ATP synthase is highly conserved among species and the enzyme can be readily separated into two portions: the water-soluble F1-ATPase and the membranebound F0 portion which acts as a proton pore. The F0 portion of Escherichia coli ATP synthase is made up of three different polypeptides with the approximate composition, ab2c9­12. The F1 portion of E. coli ATP synthase

contains five different polypeptides with the composition, 33. The major subunits of mitochondrial ATPases have sufficient sequence identity to suggest similar functions and are described by the same names [4]. The  subunit of E. coli ATP synthase, however, only has a low sequence identity with the supposed equivalent  subunit found in mitochondrial systems. We present evidence from the structure that  from mitochondrial F1ATPase, in part at least, serves the same function as  from the E. coli ATPase. The F1-ATPase has been crystallised and partial structures obtained for the rat liver [5], beef heart mitochondrial [6] and Bacillus PS3 [7] enzymes. While the structures of the  and  subunits were unambiguous in the bovine and bacterial enzymes, the structures of the small subunits  and  were not

resolved in any of the structures. The  subunit was partially resolved only in the beef heart F1-ATPase. The structure of the bovine mitochondrial enzyme reveals alternating  and  subunits arranged in a ring with the visible part of the  subunit like an axle in the centre of a wheel. The three catalytic sites, which lie in the  subunits close to the interface with a neighbouring  subunit, were each found to be in a different ligand-binding state: the first was empty; the second contained ADP; and the third contained AMP-PNP, a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue. The  subunit, which has no internal symmetry, interacts differently with each of the catalytic subunits. This is consistent with the binding change mechanism [3,8], a proposed mechanism in which the energy requiring step is not the synthesis of ATP but its release from the active site, and where the binding and release occur simultaneously at separate sites. The binding changes may be explained by a physical rotation of the  subunit with respect to the  and  subunits [6]. Several experiments, using isolated F1-ATPase, have now been conducted which support the rotational hypothesis. One of the most convincing experiments reported the crosslinking of the  subunit to one of the  subunits followed by the replacement of the two remaining  subunits with equivalent radiolabelled subunits. The cross-link was then broken, allowing catalysis to occur, and reformed to see whether the cross-link had moved to one of the radiolabelled subunits [9]. In the absence of catalytic turnover most cross-links reformed to the original unlabelled  subunit but after catalysis the cross-links were randomly distributed among the three  subunits. In addition, a direct observation of the rotation has been made in an experiment in which a fluorescent label, attached to an actin filament coupled to the  subunit, was seen to rotate with respect to the immobilised 33 hexamer in the presence of ATP [10]. What remains to be determined is how the proton translocation is coupled to the rotation of the  subunit and the synthesis of ATP and in particular the roles of the other minor subunits  and . The  subunit is known to inhibit ATPase activity in isolated F1-ATPase [11,12] and as a result  is sometimes called an inhibitory subunit. In addition, and perhaps more importantly, the  subunit is essential for the coupling of proton translocation to ATP synthesis. Absence of the  subunit prevents the binding of F1 to F0 [13]. Cross-linking studies have shown that the  subunit in the E. coli enzyme is in close contact with the  subunit [14­16], the c subunits of F0 [17], and the  and  subunits [18­20]. It has been proposed that the  subunit changes conformation or moves in order to make new interactions with different copies of the other subunits during the catalytic cycle [21]. Solution structures of the  subunit and part of the  subunit of E. coli ATP synthase have been determined using NMR spectroscopy [22,23].

We have determined the structure of the double mutant, Ala1Gly, Met2Ser (A1G, M2S),  subunit of E. coli F0F1-ATPase using X-ray crystallography at 2.3 Å resolution. We are now able to give a detailed description of the molecular structure including the interactions between the two domains which are relevant to the hypothesis of a conformational change within the  subunit.

Results
The structure of the E. coli F1ATPase  subunit forms two distinctive domains as shown in Figure 1. The first 85 residues comprise the  sandwich N-terminal (or ) domain and residues 90­136 form the C-terminal (or ) domain, which comprises an antiparallel coil of two  helices. The two domains are linked by a short loop, residues 86­89, containing a single turn of 310 helix. The  domain folds back over the top of the  domain creating an extensive contact interface that buries a total surface area of 910 Å2. The overall fold resembles a hand with the three smallest fingers folded against the palm representing the -sandwich domain and the extended thumb and forefinger representing the two  helices of the C-terminal domain. A search with the program DALI [24] failed to find a close homologue to the entire structure in the data base. Each individual domain in the  subunit is very similar to the published NMR solution structure [22] (Table 1). There was, however, little NMR data to position one domain accurately with respect to the other, and only a cursory description of the intrasubunit interactions is given in the publication of the structure [22]. The combination of the spin-label data and the few long-range distances derived from nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) did yield an overall structure for the  subunit consistent with the description given here. The N-terminal domain has two predominantly antiparallel  sheets, each of five strands, arranged as a sandwich. No structure in the data base was found with the same sheet topology and architecture. The first sheet, strands 2, 1, 9, 8 and 5, has a single parallel pair of strands, 1 and 9 (Figure 1c). The second, strictly antiparallel sheet, is comprised of strands 10, 7, 6, 3 and 4. An unusual feature of the  sandwich is that the short connecting loops between the pairs of strands 5 and 6, 7 and 8, and 9 and 10, result in an almost continuous sheet of three long bent strands that has been folded nearly in half. Each sheet has two adjacent  hairpins flanked on one end by a short strand, either 5 or 10. The apparent twofold symmetry that relates the two sheets is broken by the reversal of strands 8 and 9. The sidechains pointing to the interior of the  sandwich are hydrophobic, but the only aromatic residues with their sidechains pointing into the core of the sandwich are Tyr4 and Phe16. In addition, one face of the  sandwich has a large hydrophobic patch formed by residues Val9,

Leu42, Ala44, Ile68 and Leu79 on strands 2, 1, 9, 8 and 5 (Figure 2). This patch may have functional significance for the interaction of the  subunit with the  subunit (see below). The C-terminal helical domain has an antiparallel coiledcoil of two  helices joined by a tight loop which runs from residues Ser107 to Val112. This arrangement of helices occurs as pairs in some four-helix bundle proteins: 46 C positions from myohemerythrin [25] can be superposed onto the C-terminal domain with an rmsd of 1.6 Å. The hydrophobic contact surface between the helices is formed by Ala94, Ala97, Ala101 and Ile105 (on the outer helix) and Ala117, Leu121, Ala124 and Leu128 (on the inner helix), forming what might be termed an `alanine zipper' (Figure 3). These alanine residues actually

interdigitate like the teeth of a zipper with the alanines on one helix pointing directly between the two residues on the opposite helix. This is different from the parallel leucine zipper structures, in which the leucines from opposing helices are at the same height when the helix is viewed perpendicular to its axis. The overall spacing of the helices is, however, very similar to that observed in antiparallel helical coiled-coils, such as in myohemerythrin, which do not have alanine residues in the interior, indicating that larger sidechains can be accommodated without altering the distance between the helices. Nevertheless, most of these alanine residues are highly conserved or conservatively substituted in the family of F1ATPase  subunits (Figure 4). The `outer' face of the longer C-terminal  helix also has a hydrophobic surface formed by residues Ala115, Ala119, Ala122, Ala126, Val130

and Leu133 (Figure 3). Some of these residues form part of the interdomain interface while others are exposed to the solvent. Few of these residues are conserved.

An outline view of the molecule (Figure 1a) gives the false impression that there is little contact between the two domains resulting in a flexible linker region. On the contrary, the region between the domains together with the linking 310 helix form a closely packed hydrophobic core (Figures 2a,b). Residues contributing to this hydrophobic core include Pro47, Met49 , Phe61, Tyr63 and Ile84 (from the  sandwich) and Leu89, Ala126, Val130, and Leu133 (from the C-terminal  helix). There are no hydrogen bonds or salt bridges further stabilising the contact in this solvent-inaccessible region. Tyr63, which is on strand 7, lies in the crook between the domains with its hydroxyl group pointing towards the solvent (Figure 2b), and forms a hydrogen bond with the sidechain of residue Gln127. In the three proteins which have a tyrosine at position 63, there is always a potential hydrogen-bonding partner at position 127. Other species have a hydrophobic residue at position 63. This apparently stable interface which is preserved in solution and in the tightly packed crystal structure leaves room for a rotational motion of the two domains,

Crystal packing interactions

This unusually flat molecule packs in the P6522 space group with a single copy in the asymmetric unit, making direct contact (< 3.5 Å) with ten other symmetry-related molecules in the unit cell. These contacts include potential hydrogen bonds (< 2.9 Å): Ser10 O­Arg93 NH1 (y­x,y,3/2­z); Glu70 OE2­Gln72 NE2 (1­y,1­x,7/6+z);

Tyr114 OH­Ser118 O (x,1+x­y,5/6­z); and the reverse contacts. In addition, there is a contact across a crystallographic twofold axis that brings Glu70 into close proximity to the same residue in the symmetry-related molecule, Glu70 OE2­Glu70 OE2 (1­y,1­x,7/6+z) 2.5 Å. The orientation of this sidechain was checked in a simulated annealing `omit' electron-density map. The proximity of these carboxylate groups implies that they share at least one proton. This contact area also contains the hydrophobic residues Leu42, Ile68 and Leu79 which have been

Figure 4 continued Sequence alignment of the  subunits from bacteria and chloroplasts, and  subunits from mitochondria. The Swiss Prot [44] accession codes are employed for naming the proteins. Yellow highlights positions with greater than 80% identity and magenta highlights positions with between 50 and 80% identity. The alignment is numbered according to the E. coli sequence which is highlighted in purple. In addition to their listing in the main body of the figure, the E. coli  and bovine  mitochondrial sequences are repeated at the bottom, together with the secondary structure elements identified in the E. coli structure. Cylinders represent  helices and arrows  sheets. Amino acids marked with open circles under the  strands have their sidechains pointing into the interior of the  sandwich and similarly open circles under the  helices mark residues buried between the two helices. Filled circles label amino acids which have their sidechains between the two domains. Triangles at the bottom indicate similarities between the E. coli and bovine sequences: filled triangles indicate identity and non-filled similarity. (The figure was prepared using the program ALSCRIPT [45].)

conserved alanines in the C-terminal domain, which we have shown form the zipper contact between the helices. The highly conserved residue Asp90 at the beginning of 1 forms the N-terminal cap of the helix. We constructed an homology model of the bovine mitochondrial  subunit structure, which is equivalent to the E. coli  subunit, using the program O [28] according to the alignment shown at the bottom of Figure 4. This alignment was slightly modified from the BLAST sequence alignment to account for some notable structural features in . The multiple sequence alignment left two gaps between strands 6 and 7 in the alignment of the E. coli and bovine sequences. These gaps were closed for the model building, giving one additional identical and and one conservative substitution between the two sequences. The internal hydrophobic packing in the  sandwich is preserved by complementary changes in the sizes of amino acids in opposing  sheets. Two insertions at the bottom of the  sandwich, an alanine residue between Gly18 and Leu19 in strand 2 and an alanine at the end of 8, slightly open the barrel allowing for several additional aromatic residues in the bovine structure (Figures 4 and 5). In the C-terminal domain the overall alignment in the loop between the helices is uncertain. The multiple sequence alignment predicts that the loop in the bovine structure is considerably longer and the last helix much shorter. This difference can be reduced by shuffling the sequences from the right to fill the last gap, however, this results in the loss of the alanine zipper between the helices. Our preferred alignment, shown at the bottom of Figure 4, amalgamates the two gaps in the E. coli sequence into one by a shift to fit the secondary structure. The shorter terminal helix in the bovine structure would reduce the tight packing between the domains.
Mutations affecting the e subunit

proposed to interact with the  subunit (see below). Residues 68 and 79 are highly conserved in the  family of proteins (Figure 4). Although the contact in the crystal is not a particularly intimate one, the molecules are mostly close enough to exclude water from the interface. The importance of the close crystal packing involving both domains of the molecule is that the overall structure, relating the domains, is the same as defined by spin labelling and NOE NMR experiments in solution [22], suggesting that the molecule is reasonably rigid. The  subunit carries out its biological role by interacting with other subunits of the F0F1-ATP synthase [13,26]. There is a great deal of evidence from mutation and crosslinking studies, which define both the importance of particular residues in the  subunit and the importance of residues in other subunits with which the  subunit interacts. We can now attempt to rationalise some of these observations in terms of the structure.
Sequence alignment and model of the bovine mitochondrial e subunit

Discussion

In order to define whether or not the  subunits of mitochondrial ATPases are equivalent to the  subunit of the E. coli protein, we have first used the program BLAST [27] to align 50 sequences from a wide variety of organisms (Figure 4). There are no fully conserved residues among all  subunit sequences and the most conserved residues are evenly spread across the alignment. Of these, many are prolines and glycines which lie between and in the heavily bent  strands of the E. coli structure suggesting that all the proteins have a similar fold. The most conserved sequence forms part of strand 4 and the connecting loop to strand 5. Residues in this region of the structure have been shown to bind to the F0 c subunit [17]. Although the more conserved areas of the sequence are in the N-terminal domain, there are a number of

Kuki et al. [29] constructed a series of C-terminal deletion mutants and found that function was retained with an  subunit lacking the C-terminal 60 amino acids. This is consistent with the fact that the  subunit from the green bacterium Chlorobium limicola (Swiss Prot. accession number ATPE_CHLLI) naturally lacks the equivalent of these residues (Figure 4). Such a deletion includes all of the C-terminal helical domain and extends into the N-terminal  sandwich domain. The construct containing residues 1­78 forms a functional enzyme, while the construct containing only residues 1­73 does not [29]. The removal of the additional five residues causes the loss of strand 9 in the middle of the molecule, and this together with the loss of strand 10 probably prevents the molecule from folding due to loss of interactions with strands 1 and 8. Using a similar approach, Janouchi et al., [30] found that significant activity could be retained with the deletion of 15 N-terminal amino acids from the  subunit, but activity

against the sidechain of Thr26. A second mutation of Pro47 may be able, by giving the polypeptide backbone greater flexibility, to partially reverse the conformational change when Gly48 is mutated. In those proteins which do not have a glycine residue at position 48 there is never a proline residue at position 47. Mutations affecting Glu31 and His38 have been investigated by LaRoe and Vik [32]. His38 is highly conserved in all  subunits and Glu31 interacts with the c subunits of F0 (see below). As judged by growth tests, 12 amino acid substitutions constructed at position 31 had no significant effect on ATP synthesis. In the same way, 12 amino acid substitutions were constructed at position 38 with the mutation His38Pro preventing growth on succinate media and causing poor growth on glucose media. Substitution of residue 38 by arginine had a partial effect. Residue 38 makes a mainchain­mainchain hydrogen bond to residue 35 forming a type II  turn. This turn and the following loop are well defined in the X-ray structure but were poorly defined in the NMR structure [22]. The loop contains several of the most conserved residues, including His38 itself (Figures 2 and 4).

was lost with the deletion of 16 residues. In the construct containing residues 16­138, Phe16 could be important for the stabilisation of strand 2 in the absence of strand 1. We would conclude that removal of residues 1­16 also results in improper folding of the  subunit. Missense mutations affecting two residues of the  subunit have been described that significantly affect F0F1ATPase activity. A Gly48Asp mutation affected assembly of the enzyme, a defect that could be overcome by increasing the gene dosage [31]. The fully assembled enzyme, however, was unable to carry out ATP-dependent proton translocation and ATPase activity was about 30% of the wild-type enzyme. The mutant characteristics were reversed by a second mutation Pro47Ser or Pro47Thr (Figure 1a). Gly48 is highly, but not strictly, conserved (Figure 4). It occurs in a bulge in strand 6 which interrupts the regular hydrogen bonding to strand 3. The backbone torsion angles for Gly48 ( = ­180°;  = ­140°) lie in a glycine-only allowed region of the Ramachandran plot, implying that mutation to any other residue would result in a change in the backbone conformation. Furthermore, the hydrogen atom of Gly48, which would be replaced by a sidechain if this residue was mutated, is closely packed

and cross-linked to the  subunit using either heterobifunctional cross-linkers [14,15] or by disulphide formation with a Tyr205Cys mutant of the  subunit [16]. Aggeler et al. [33] demonstrated that a cysteine residue at position 38 was able to react with maleimides in a purified F1ATPase but was unable to react in a purified F1F0-ATPase. Furthermore, coupled functions were affected when modified F1-ATPase was reconstituted with the F0 portion. Zhang and Fillingame [17] observed disulphide bridge formation between subunit c and the  subunit in double mutant strains carrying the  mutation Glu31Cys and any of three c subunit mutants, Ala40Cys, Gln42Cys or Pro43Cys. Both residues 31 and 38 occur at one end of the -sandwich domain (Figures 2a,c) and the available evidence (outlined above) indicates that this region interacts with the F0 portion. The N-terminal domain of the  subunit also clearly interacts with the  subunit with crosslinks obtained between a cysteine residue placed at position 10 of the  subunit and position 228 of the  subunit [34]. Cysteines at positions 38 or 43 formed disulphide bridges with a cysteine residue placed at position 205 of the  subunit [16]. From the NMR structure, Wilkens et al. [22] suggested that the hydrophobic patch Val9, Met15, Leu42, Ile68, Thr77 and Leu79 may also interact with the  subunit (Figures 2 and 6). In the X-ray structure the sidechain of Met15 points in the opposite direction to the other sidechains forming the patch, due to a bulge in the  strand, and is not actually part of the hydrophobic patch.

Interaction of the e subunit with the a and b subunits

Figure 6

The C-terminal domain of the  subunit has been shown to be located in close proximity to the  and  subunits of the F1-ATPase. Dallmann et al. [18] described a cross-link between the  subunit and the  subunit that was induced by a water-soluble carbodiimide; an ester linkage was found between a glutamate residue at position 381 in the  subunit and a serine residue at position 108 in the  subunit. The closeness of these two residues was confirmed by disulphide formation between a cysteine inserted at position 381 of the  subunit and a cysteine inserted at position 108 of the  subunit [19]. Residue 411 of the  subunit is the structural equivalent of residue 381 of the  subunit. Aggeler et al. [20] demonstrated disulphide formation between a cysteine placed at position 411 of the  subunit and a cysteine placed at position 108 of the  subunit. A cysteine at position 108 of  formed a disulphide with either cysteine at 411 in the  subunit, in the presence of added ATP, or cysteine 381 in the  subunit in the presence of added ADP. However, ­ cross-links were detected at high levels when the double mutant  Cys411,  Cys381 was constructed. This observation suggests that in these experiments the  and  subunits may move with respect to each other, rather than there being simply a relative movement of the  subunit. Formation of a ­­ cross-linked product has also been reported [21] with one linkage occurring between  Cys108 and  Cys381 with the second  crosslinked via  Cys138.

We have tried to identify a plausible docking arrangement of the  subunit within the F0F1 complex, which satisfies the above mentioned studies, using the crystal structure of the mitochondrial F1 complex (MF1) [6]. Residue 10 in the  subunit can be cross-linked to Tyr228 in the  subunit [35]; the corresponding residue in the MF1  subunit is Tyr214. This residue can be seen in the structure of MF1, but none of the other corresponding residues in the area identified to interact with the  subunit has been positioned. Residue Tyr205Cys of the E. coli F1  subunit, which can form a disulphide bridge both with residues in the  subunit (residues His38 and 43) and the c subunit (residues 39, 42 and 43), corresponds to a residue around 190 in the MF1. This residue cannot be seen in the MF1 structure. We fitted our structure so as to form a reasonable packing arrangement relative to the observed residues in this area, with residue 10 of the  subunit at an appropriate distance from Tyr214 of the  subunit (Figure 6). In this position the highly conserved residue Leu79 of the  subunit stacks onto the conserved Tyr44 and Tyr214 of the MF1  subunit (Tyr45 and Tyr228 in E. coli). There is apparently no way to maintain this interaction between the  and  subunits and to simultaneously position the molecule so as to satisfy the binding of the Cterminal helix of the  subunit to the  and  subunits.

Assuming the  subunit retains the crystal structure in the holoenzyme, if -residue 31 cross-links with residues of the c subunit and  residue 38 is also positioned close to the membrane, then at least in the E. coli [21] enzyme the  and  subunits may in fact extend to within about 1 nm of the membrane surface, as dictated by the overall dimensions of the  subunit. The distance between the  carbon atoms of residues 108 and 136 (the last residue defined by the  crystal structure) is within a few Ångströms of the largest distance between the  carbon atoms of residues 381 on two  residues, as defined by the crystal structure of MF1. The formation of ­­ cross-links involving residues 108 and 138 of an  subunit and position 381 on two  subunits is therefore compatible with both crystal structures, providing that a steric clash with the  subunit is avoided.

Large conformational changes, such as the pH-driven event observed in haemagglutinin and the protease clipping in serpins cannot, however, be ruled out for the  subunit as it changes its interactions with the other subunits during the catalytic cycle. An essential role for a relative motion of the two domains of the  subunit in transmitting the force derived from proton translocation is unlikely given the occurrence of at least one species in which the  subunit has only one domain.

resembles an earlier description of the solution structure of the  subunit determined using NMR spectroscopy. An apparently stable interface between the domains makes it less likely that large conformational changes in the  subunit accompany the relative rotation of the subunits proposed to occur during ATP synthesis. The still largely unanswered question is how proton translocation through the membrane is coupled to the suggested relative motions of the catalytic and membrane bound subunits.

Biological implications
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which occurs in all known life forms, is the `high-energy' intermediate that constitutes the most common cellular energy currency. The enzyme F0F1-ATP synthase, which generates ATP from ADP, is energised by a transmembrane proton gradient that is created by photosynthesis or respiration. The proton-translocating ATP synthases in mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacteria have a common architecture comprising two portions, F1 and F0. The F0 portion is an integral membrane protein consisting of three or more different polypeptides. The F1 portion can be isolated as a soluble fraction which acts as an ATPase, converting ATP to ADP, and has the subunit composition 33. There are three catalytic sites within F1 which are located in the  subunits, as revealed by the structure of the bovine mitochondrial enzyme. The coupling of proton translocation through F0 to ATP synthesis in F1 has been proposed to proceed via the `binding change' mechanism, in which each of the three chemically identical active sites is held in a different conformational state by their asymmetric interaction with the single-copy subunits,  and . The crystal structure of the bovine enzyme trapped each of the catalytic sites in a different liganded state, and each of the  subunits made a different interaction with the limited portions of the  subunit (~45%) visible in the crystal structure. This observation provided support for an earlier hypothesis: that components of the two portions of ATP synthase actually rotate with respect to each other during the catalytic cycle. Recent biophysical experiments have now observed this physical rotation. What is the role of the  subunit in ATP synthase? Absence of the  subunit prevents the binding of F0 to F1 and is thus essential for the coupling of proton translocation to ATP synthesis. The  subunit is also known to inhibit ATPase activity in isolated F1-ATPase. We report here the crystal structure of the  subunit of Escherichia coli ATP synthase. The molecule is comprised of two domains: the N-terminal  sandwich domain, which has a novel topology with two five-stranded  sheets; and the Cterminal domain, which contains two antiparallel  helices with an interface between them described as an `alanine zipper'. Each of the individual domains closely

Materials and methods
Data collection and processing
The expression, purification and crystallisation of the A1G, M2S protein has been described [36]. The crystals were grown by the vapour diffusion method in hanging drops. The reservoir contained 2 M K2HPO4/ NaH2PO4.2H2O, 100 mM Hepes buffer, (pH 7.5), and 200 mM NH2SO4. The hanging drop (5 to 20 µl) was composed of a 1:1 mixture of a 4 mg/ml protein solution and the reservoir solution. Despite repeated attempts over a wide range of conditions, the original problem which caused crystallisation to take a very long time, typically between nine and 12 months, was never overcome. All diffraction data were recorded on an R-Axis II imaging plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotatinganode generator using mirror optics (Z Otwinowski and G Johnson, Yale University, as marketed by Molecular Structure Corporation, Texas, USA) and a 0.3 mm focal spot. The data were integrated and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK [37]. Data for the native protein were recorded from a single crystal to a resolution of 2.3 Å (Table 2).

Phase determination and structure refinement
Initial attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement (MR) using the NMR structure as a search model were unsuccessful. A number of different search models were tried, including the average structure, a polyalanine and a polyserine structure. Attempts were also made with the individual domains and with both domains using different interdomain angles. Rotation and translation searches were made using both AMORE [38] and X-PLOR [39]. The failure to clearly identify the correct solution probably results from the differences between the NMR structure for the complete molecule and the X-ray structure and the fact that too small a fraction of the molecule was present when searching using only individual domains. The structure was eventually solved by conventional multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) using a total of two different heavy-atom compounds which yielded a total of four derivative data sets. Derivatives were prepared by soaking crystals in a stabilising solution (equivalent to the well solution over which the hanging drops had been placed), with the heavy atom compound added over several hours until the final concentration had been reached (Table 2). Given the very small number of crystals that were available the first attempts to prepare derivatives were made using the same crystal that had been used to record the native data. The crystal was subjected to rounds of heavy atom soaking, data recording and back-soaking in heavy atom free buffer. The reagents used were 1 mM K2PtCl4, 1.25 mM methylmercury chloride and 1.25 mM phenylmercury acetate. Only the platinum compound yielded useful phasing information. The methylmercury chloride data were used as a second platinum derivative when it became clear that the platinum had not been removed from the crystal by the back-soaking or that the mercury had bound at the same location with lower occupancy. Further heavy-atom data were recorded from a second crystal some years later. This crystal was soaked in 2.5 mM p-chloromercurybenzene sulfonic acid (PCMBS). Two data sets were recorded from the same crystal before and after a breakdown of the X-ray diffraction equipment. The data sets were treated independently for the phase calculations. Thus each of the two `independent' derivatives were each represented by two data sets in the phase calculations. We note that this is a formally incorrect procedure which leads to errors in the phase probability distribution. It was,

in Table 2. The MIR phases were extended and refined by solvent flattening and histogram matching using DM [38]. The correct enantiomorph of the space group P6522 was chosen on the basis of positive refined anomalous occupancies for the heavy atoms and the correct handedness of helices identified in the MIR electron-density map. Model building into electron-density maps was carried out with the program O [28]. Knowledge of the NMR structure was especially helpful in tracing the chain in the -sheet domain. The structure was extensively checked throughout with omit electron density difference maps. Structure refinement was performed using simulated annealing with XPLOR [39] and finally with REFMAC [38]. Other computer programs used in the structure solution and analysis included, SIGMAA [38] and MOLEMAN [40]. Some areas of the refined structure are in poorly defined electron density and the atoms in the model have correspondingly high B factor values (Figure 1b). There is no or very weak electron density in omit maps for residues 29, 55, 56 and 109­112. Details of the refinement are given in Table 3.
