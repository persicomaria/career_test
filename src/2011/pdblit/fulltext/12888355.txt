Binding of OMTKY3 to PPE

Introduction
An understanding of the structural basis for protein-protein interactions, and molecular recognition in general, requires complete characterization of binding energetics and correlation of those energetics with the structures involved. Not only does this require quanti®cation of the changes that occur in all of the thermodynamic parameters upon binding, including the enthalpy, entropy and heat capacity, but also a description of how these changes are modulated by environmental conditions, most notably pH. Molecular recognition shows pH dependency when binding is linked to a change in the degree of protonation, i.e. when binding results in a change in the pKa of an ionizable group. Such proton linkage can have a signi®cant in¯uence on the observed binding energetics (Eftink et al., 1983; Baker & Murphy, 1996), and may have important physiological or regulatory consequences, as seen in the Bohr effect in hemoglobin. There is currently signi®cant interest in correlating experimentally measured binding energetics with those calculated from structural information (Connelly et al., 1990; Connelly & Thompson, 1992; Krystek et al., 1993; Murphy et al., 1993, 1995; Bhat et al., 1994; Spolar & Â Record, 1994; Vajda et al., 1994; Gomez & Freire, 1995). However, as mentioned above, contributions from equilibria linked to binding can in¯uence the observed binding energetics. Unless the contributions from such linkage are explicitly considered in calculations or are experimentally separated from the intrinsic energetics (those that would be measured in the absence of any linkage effects), calculated and experimentally determined values cannot be directly compared. In order to study the thermodynamic basis of molecular recognition and the effects of proton linkage upon binding energetics, we have investigated the energetics of the binding of turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3), a Kazaltype serine protease inhibitor, to the serine protease porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE). Ovomucoid third domains are small proteins of 51 to 56 residues. An NMR structure is available for the turkey variant (Krezel et al., 1994), and Xray structures are available for the Japanese quail and silver pheasant variants (Papamokos et al., 1982; Bode et al., 1985), the latter of which differs from the turkey protein by a single methionine to leucine substitution. The structure has one a-helix and a three-stranded beta-sheet forming a ``scaffold'', with an extended, solvent-exposed ``binding loop'' (Read & James, 1986; Bode & Huber, 1992). PPE is a 240 residue serine protease whose crystallographic structure is known (Meyer et al., 1988). PPE shares a large degree of sequence and structural homology with other members of

the serine protease family, most notably human leukocyte elastase (HLE) and bovine a-chymotrypsin (aCT; Bode et al., 1989). The protein consists of two b-barrel domains that interact to form a crevice containing the catalytic site, which is complementary to the OMTKY3 binding loop. The interaction of OMTKY3 with serine proteases has been investigated crystallographically. Structures are available for OMTKY3 in complex with HLE (Bode et al., 1986), aCT (Fujinaga et al., 1987) and Streptomyces griseus protease B (SGPB; Read et al., 1983; Huang et al., 1995). Excellent reviews are available that discuss in depth the structural details of the interaction (Read & James, 1986; Bode et al., 1989; Bode & Huber, 1992). Brie¯y, OMTKY3 interacts with serine proteases via the binding loop and a smaller ``secondary binding segment.'' Structural comparisons of the complexes with the free proteins reveal that no signi®cant conformational changes occur in either protein upon binding; the binding can thus be considered a rigid-body interaction. Equilibrium constants for the binding of many ovomucoid third domain variants to several serine proteases, including OMTKY3 to PPE, are available (Empie & Laskowski, 1982; Bigler et al., 1993). Ovomucoid third domains bind to serine proteases very tightly; the observed equilibrium constant for OMTKY3 binding to PPE is 4.1 (Æ0.8) Â 1010 MÀ1 at pH 8.3 and 21 C (Bigler et al., 1993). Ovomucoid third domains are also substrates for the proteases they inhibit, but the equilibrium between cleaved and uncleaved forms is near unity and the time required to reach that equilibrium can be of the order of days (Ardelt & Laskowski, 1983, 1991). Finally, it has been known for some time that the binding of protein inhibitors to their cognate serine proteases involves proton linkage, arising from a pKa shift upon binding (Vincent & Lazdunski, 1973; Ascenzi et al., 1991a and references therein). This linkage has generally been attributed to histidine 57 in the protease active site. Generally, the pKa values of an ionizable group contributing to proton linkage are determined from the pH-dependence of the binding constant. However, we have recently shown that pKa determinations can be made in the absence of any knowledge of the binding constant by studying the enthalpy of binding in various buffers over a narrow pH range (Baker & Murphy, 1996). Here, we have used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to examine the energetics of OMTKY3 binding to PPE as a function of pH, temperature, and buffer ionization enthalpy. Using global analysis of these data, we have determined the intrinsic ÁH and ÁCp of binding as well as the energetics of the proton linkage. In conjunction with the published value for the binding constant, we also calculate the intrinsic ÁS and ÁG of binding. The

interaction has been further examined with molecular modeling and empirical, structure-based calculations for comparison with the measured energetics.

Theory
Global proton linkage analysis We presented recently a theoretical treatment demonstrating the use of ITC measurements to determine the effects of proton linkage upon ligand binding (Baker & Murphy, 1996); a brief account is given here. Given a protein that binds both a single ligand and a single proton, the observed ligand binding constant is given as the product of the intrinsic ligand binding constant (Kint, the binding constant for the unprotonated protein) and the ratio of the proton binding polynomials for the complexed and free proteins: Kos  Kint

Here, Kc and Kf are the proton binding constants p p for the free and the complexed protein (equal to 10pKa ) and aH is the proton activity (equal to 10ÀpH). Typically, equation (1) is used to determine Kc and Kf by studying Kobs as a function of pH. p p However, information regarding Kc and Kf is also p p available through enthalpic effects (Baker & Murphy, 1996), as developed below.

The difference between these two values yields the number of protons released by the buffer (NH) upon binding of the ligand to the protein: " " Nr  H  À H f 4 ITC measures the observed binding enthalpy (ÁH ) when a ligand solution is injected into a obs protein solution. The observed binding enthalpy is dependent on the buffer ionization enthalpy (ÁHb) i and can be represented as:
  ÁHos  ÁH0  Nr ÁHi

The temperature-dependence of ÁH is given as obs the temperature derivative of equation (7) (Baker & Murphy, 1996), where the temperature-dependence of ÁH is ÁCp,int. The temperature-dependence of int the other terms in equation (7) can be evaluated analytically as described (Baker & Murphy, 1996). A data set of ÁH as a function of pH, buffer obs ionization enthalpy, and temperature can thus be ®t globally to obtain the intrinsic ÁH and ÁCp of binding, as well as the pKa values, protonation enthalpies, and protonation heat capacities associated with the proton linkage. When analyzed in this manner, no knowledge of the ligand binding constant is required. Furthermore, a global analysis, in which all of the data are ®t simultaneously, allows the ®tted parameters to be determined with greater con®dence than could be obtained with data at only one pH or temperature (Beechem, 1992).

Results
Isothermal titration calorimetry of the binding of OMTKY3 to PPE The energetics of OMTKY3 binding to PPE were measured using ITC. Figure 1 shows a representative titration of PPE with OMTKY3 in Pipes buffer (pH 6.0) at 5 C. The small peaks after the tenth injection represent post-saturation heats of dilution and viscous mixing. The binding of OMTKY3 to PPE is stoichiometric under all conditions examined in this study; thus, after subtracting the postsaturation heats, the integrated area under each

Table 1 shows the i average ÁH for each titration experiment plus or obs minus one standard deviation. In the global analysis performed, the value of ÁH for each injection obs was used as a datum point (excluding the ®rst and saturating injections as described in Materials and Methods). The number in parentheses following ÁH is the number of injections from the titration obs used in the global analysis. The values listed for ÁHb at temperatures other than 25 C are corrected i for temperature using published values of ÁCb p,i (Christensen et al., 1976) assuming a linear temperature-dependence. A total of 143 datum points were included in the ®t, giving 135 degrees of freedom with eight adjustable parameters. Experiments performed with the addition of 50 or 100 mM NaCl showed no signi®cant deviations from the reported values (data not shown). However, we observed a marked, linear dependence of ÁH on phosphate concentration (up to 150 mM) obs that was independent of added salt (data not shown). In light of this, all buffers used were investigated by performing binding experiments at multiple buffer concentrations. None of the buffers in Table 1 behaved anamolously; buffers in addition to phosphate that did appear to in¯uence ÁH obs were acetate, cacodylate, and glycerol 2-phosphate. The data in Table 1 were ®t globally as described in the Materials and Methods, allowing for the determination of the proton linkage energetics, summarized in Table 2, and the intrinsic binding energetics, summarized in Table 3 (the free energies and entropies in Tables 2 and 3 are not ®tted parameters; their values were determined as de-

scribed below). The error listed for each parameter represents the 68.3% con®dence interval from the ®t or, for the free energies and entropies, the propagated error (Bevington & Robinson, 1992). The standard error of the ®t was 1.3 kJ molÀ1, which corresponds approximately to 20 mJ per injection. No signi®cant correlations were observed between the ®tted parameters. ÁCf and dÁCp,p were inp,p cluded in the analysis for completeness, but the ®tted values are poorly determined. Constraining these values at zero results in a statistically poorer ®t, but the resultant parameters are indistinguishable statistically from those generated with the ®t to all eight parameters. The energetics in the pH range studied (pH 5.5 to 8.0) are consistent with a single ionizable group undergoing a pKa shift upon binding. No signi®cant improvement in the ®t is observed with more complicated models. Additional proton linkage effects are observed at low pH (B.B., S. Edgcomb & K.M., unpublished results; Michael Laskowski Jr,

The quality of the ®t is indicated in Figure 2 which shows the experimental and ®tted values of ÁH for each experiment in Table 1. It can be obs seen that the model provides an excellent ®t to the data within the pH and temperature range studied. Figure 3 shows a plot of ÁH versus ÁHb for obs i experiments performed at pH 6 and pH 7 at 25 C. As discussed above, these plots are linear with slopes equal to NH. The lines in Figure 3 are not linear least-squares ®ts to the points shown, but are calculated from the parameters in Tables 2 and 3. The difference in slopes between pH 6 and pH 7 re¯ects the dependence of NH on pH (equation (4)). Figure 4 shows a plot of ÁH versus temperaobs ture for experiments performed at pH 6 in Pipes and at pH 7 in imidazole. These plots are also linear, with slopes equal to ÁCp,obs. As with Figure 3, the lines are calculated from the parameters in Tables 2 and 3. The difference in the slopes is due to the effects of pH and ÁHb on ÁCp,obs in a proi ton-linked system (Baker & Murphy, 1996). The observed equilibrium constant for OMTKY3 binding to PPE is 4.1 (Æ0.8) Â 1010 MÀ1 at pH 8.3 and 21 C (Bigler et al., 1993). This value and the ®tted parameters were used to calculate the intrinsic binding constant at 25 C. Equation (1) was

used with the experimental pKa values to calculate Kint at 21 C, correcting the pKa values for temperature using the integrated form of the van't Hoff equation and the experimental proton binding enthalpies. Kint at 25 C was then calculated from the integrated van't Hoff equation, using the experimental intrinsic binding enthalpy and heat capacity.

Molecular modeling and structural thermodynamic calculations The binding of OMTKY3 to PPE was investigated with molecular modeling and structurebased thermodynamic calculations. A model of the PPE-OMTKY3 complex was built using the crystal structure of the HLE-OMTKY3 complex as a template (see Materials and Methods for modeling details). The interface in the model compares well with that in other serine protease-OMTKY3 structures when considering the identity of the residues, the amount and type of surface area buried, inter-

molecular hydrogen bonds, and the geometry near the active site. As with the HLE-OMTKY3 crystallographic structure, there are seven intermolecular hydrogen bonds and no salt-bridges across the protein-protein interface. The individual proteins in the modeled complex show no signi®cant changes from their corresponding free structures. From the model, the residues participating in the protein-protein interface and the changes that occur in polar and apolar solvent-accessible surface area upon binding (ÁASApol and ÁASAap, respectively) were determined (see Materials and

563 water from the proton upon burial in the interface). However, if desolvation were the only mechanism responsible for the pKa change, one might expect the pKa shift to be much larger (e.g. see Stites et al., 1991; Langsetmo et al., 1991; Qasim et al., 1995). Inhibitor binding to serine proteases causes a small reorientation of the side-chain of Ser195, placing its hydroxyl oxygen atom within hydrogen-bonding distance of NE2 of His57 (Read & James, 1986; Bolognesi et al., 1982). Also, the carboxyl group of Ê Glu19 in OMTKY3 is positioned approximately 4 A from the side-chain of His57 in the complex (measuring from NE2 to OD1). It is possible that such interactions act to offset the negative pKa shift brought about by desolvation. Thus it is dif®cult to assign the observed energetics to any single mechanism; they are probably due to a combination of desolvation and electrostatic effects. The pKa shift is important mechanistically. In the catalytic triad of serine proteases, the hydroxyl proton of Ser195 is transferred to His57, and the resultant positive charge is stabilized by the negative charge on Asp102 (Warshel et al., 1989). If His57 is already protonated, it cannot accept the hydroxyl proton of Ser195 and the enzyme is inactive. For free elastase at pH 7, 33% of the molecules have His57 protonated and are thus inactive. However, upon binding the inhibitor/substrate, the pKa drops to 5.2 so that only 2% of the molecules have a protonated His57. Thus, the pKa shift ``activates'' the enzyme and should be considered as an integral component of the serine protease mechanism. It may seem contradictory that the pKa of His57 is decreased when it must serve as an acceptor of the proton from Ser195. However, the decrease in the histidine pKa is for the transfer of a proton from aqueous solution. As mentioned above, this decrease probably re¯ects the added enthalpic cost of stripping water from the proton upon transfer to the anhydrous interface. In contrast, the hydroxyl proton of Ser195 is already desolvated and its transfer to His57 does not carry this desolvation penalty. Thus the pKa shift acts to ``select'' for proton transfer from Ser195 as opposed to protons from bulk solvent. Observed PPE/OMTKY3 binding energetics The pKa shift imparts a marked pH and buffer dependence upon all of the observed thermodynamic parameters of binding (excludingÁG , obs which is in¯uenced only by pH). This is illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, which show the in¯uence of pH and buffer ionization enthalpy on the ÁH and obs ÁCp,obs of binding. It is of interest that the contribution of ÁH at 25 C to the overall binding free obs energy can be markedly favorable or unfavorable depending upon the solution conditions, ranging from À17 to 37 kJ molÀ1. Nevertheless, the intrinsic binding enthalpy is negligible at 25 C. The presence of a phosphate effect on the observed binding enthalpy is interesting in light of

Ê Methods). ÁASAap was calculated as À1130 A2 Ê and ÁASApol as À660 A2. The values of ÁASApol and ÁASAap were used in calculating the intrinsic ÁCp, ÁH , and ÁS of binding. The calculations were performed using a previously published empirical method (Murphy & Freire, 1992; Xie & Freire, 1994), and are described brie¯y in Materials and Methods. In addition to accurately predicting protein unfolding energetics, these calculations have performed well in calculating energetics associated with ligand Â binding (Murphy et al., 1993; Gomez & Freire, 1995). The results of the calculations are shown in Table 4; a comparison with Table 3 indicates that the calculated values agree very well with the experimentally determined intrinsic binding energetics. The contributions of each residue in the protein-protein interface to the calculated ÁG is shown in Figure 5; Figure 6 shows these values mapped to the surface of the protein-protein interface.

Discussion
Proton linkage energetics The ITC data described above allow us to determine the thermodynamics of proton binding to both free and complexed PPE; these results are summarized in Table 3. The pKa values and the large ÁHf are consistent with a histidine sidep chain, although we cannot unambiguously identify the ionizable group from the energetics. The best candidate is His57 in the protease active site, as it is the only histidine side-chain in the protein-protein interface (the other histidine residue in the interface, His40, contributes only its carbonyl oxygen atom to the interface). Previous work by other researchers supports the assignment of the pKa shift to His57. A wealth of kinetic, equilibrium and structural information has established that the pKa of His57 in uncomplexed serine proteases is close to 7 (see Creighton, 1993 and references therein); the pKa in PPE has been measured as 6.5 (Kaplan & Douglas, 1969), 6.7 (Bender & Marshall, 1968) and 6.85 (Geneste & Bender, 1969), in agreement with our determination of 6.7 Æ 0.1. Marshall & Chen (1973) measured a value of À24.6 (Æ0.2) kJ molÀ1 for the protonation enthalpy of His57 in PPE, in good agreement with our value of À28 (Æ3) kJ molÀ1. Finally, pKa shifts from $7 to $5 have been reported for the binding of other protein inhibitors to a wide range of serine proteases (Vincent & Lazdunski, 1973; Ascenzi et al., 1991a and references therein), consistent with the shift observed here. Our measurements provide a breakdown of the pKa shift into enthalpic and entropic components. Given that His57 is exposed in the free protease and fully buried upon formation of the complex, the positive value of dÁHp likely re¯ects a desolvation penalty (the additional enthalpy of stripping

564 the recent results reported by Huang et al. (1995), who found a bound phosphate group in the interface between SGPB and OMTKY3. The observed effect likely represents linkage between the binding of OMTKY3 and the binding of phosphate. It is theoretically possible to treat this phosphate linkage in a manner analogous to the proton linkage, although there may be experimental limitations preventing such an analysis. The indication that other buffers have a similar in¯uence suggests that this may not be a phosphate-speci®c effect. Note that anomalous buffer effects have been observed before in investigations of serine-protease/inhibitor interactions (Quast et al., 1974), and that acetate is known to be a weak inhibitor of PPE (Winninger et al., 1978). Thermodynamic parameters have been reported for a variety of protein inhibitors binding to their cognate serine proteases. Data are available for Kazal inhibitors (Menegatti et al., 1987; Ascenzi et al., 1991b; Schweitz et al., 1973; Baugh & Trowbridge, 1972), Kunitz inhibitors (Ascenzi et al., 1990a,b; Baugh & Trowbridge, 1972; Vincent & Lazdunski, 1973) and inhibitors belonging to other families (Ascenzi et al., 1991a, 1995; Turner et al., 1975). It seems a general feature of these inhibitors that binding results in a pKa shift for His57. While the in¯uence of this proton linkage on the energetics has been noted (Turner et al., 1975; Barnhill & Trowbridge, 1975; Yung & Trowbridge, 1980), the intrinsic energetics have not been determined in these studies. Additionally, the values reported by Ascenzi and co-workers have been obtained from van't Hoff analyses, but the contribution from the large heat capacity change expected for these interactions has not been taken into account (e.g. see Menegatti et al., 1987; Ascenzi et al., 1990b). Nevertheless, consistencies among the available data suggest that the binding of protein inhibitors to their cognate serine proteases in general entails thermodynamic features similar to those reported here. Structure-based thermodynamic calculations and intrinsic binding energetics The experimental, intrinsic binding energetics in Table 3 can be directly compared with the calculated energetics in Table 4. The agreement between the two sets of values is very good. The calculated values of ÁCp and ÁS lie just outside the error in the experimental measurements. The only qualitative discrepancy appears in ÁH (i.e. the values are of opposite sign); however, both the calculated and experimental values are negligible, and at this level the agreement is close. The parameters combine to yield a ÁG that is within 10% of the experimental value. Intrinsically, OMTKY3 binds to PPE with a very small ÁH , a large positive ÁS , and a large negative ÁCp (Table 3). Such energetics might be construed as indicating that the binding is purely hydrophobic in nature, because the transfer of

Binding of OMTKY3 to PPE

liquid hydrocarbons from water is characterized by È similar energetics (Gill & Wadso, 1976; Baldwin, 1986). However, interpretation of binding energetics solely in terms of the hydrophobic effect is misleading (Ross & Subramanian, 1981). Rather, the changes in enthalpy, entropy and heat capacity are the result of large, compensating effects (Murphy & Gill, 1991; Murphy & Freire, 1992). Given the good agreement between the measured intrinsic energetics and the structure-based calculations, it is useful to use the results of the calculations in addressing this issue. From Table 4, the overall, calculated ÁH at  25 C is 2.3 kJ molÀ1, but this is comprised of a polar contribution of À118.8 kJ molÀ1 and an apolar contribution of 114.2 kJ molÀ1. If the polar contribution were zero, the binding free energy would be large and unfavorable. It would appear that the ÁH associated with the hydrogen-bonding polar groups provides a signi®cant stabilization of the complex, in agreement with model compound results (Habermann & Murphy, 1996). Even the large negative ÁCp, which is often taken as a thermodynamic signature of the hydrophobic effect (Dill, 1990; Privalov et al., 1990), has signi®cant polar contributions (Murphy & Gill, 1991; Spolar et al., 1992). The binding entropy is likewise composed of compensating terms. As seen in Table 4, the restructuring of solvent, due largely to the hydrophobic effect, is a major driving force in stabilizing the complex. However, ÁS solv is offset considerably by unfavorable losses in side-chain conformational entropy (ÁS ). This entropic loss has conf occasionally been excluded in calculations of binding energetics (Horton & Lewis, 1992; Spolar & Record, 1994), requiring the use of a much larger estimate of the loss in translational/rotational entropy than given by the cratic correction used here. Our results suggest that the neglect of ÁS is inconf appropriate even in a rigid-body interaction like that studied here. Higher estimates of the loss in translational/rotational entropy in the studies have been obtained partly by application of the Sakur-Tetrode equation (Finkelstein & Janin, 1989; Williams et al., 1991; Janin, 1995). It has been suggested that the values obtained by this approach are over-estimates (Murphy et al., 1994; Brady & Sharp, 1997). Based upon the results presented here, and other, similar, treatÂ ments (Murphy et al., 1993; Gomez & Freire, 1995), it appears that when the entropy of polar and apolar solvation and the loss of conformational entropy are taken into account, the cratic correction accounts well for the loss in translational/rotational entropy that occurs upon binding (Murphy et al., 1994). Figure 5 shows the individual residue contributions to the binding energetics (excluding the cratic entropy term) and Figure 6 shows these contributions mapped to the surface of the three-dimensional structure. A signi®cant amount of the binding free energy (42%) can be attributed to the

OMTKY3 binding loop (residues 13 to 21; note the dominant contribution from Leu18 at the P1 site, clearly seen in Figure 6). This is largely due to the burial of a large amount of hydrophobic surface upon binding, but a signi®cant contribution can be attributed to polar interactions, as evidenced by the presence of large, negative enthalpies (note that the positive apolar contribution to the enthalpy precludes a direct correlation with enthalpy and the presence or absence of speci®c hydrogen bonds). It is important to point out that the calculated contributions to the binding free energy are context-dependent; that is, they represent the contribution of the residue in the context of the threedimensional structure of the interface. These calculated contributions are not directly comparable to values of ÁÁG obtained by site-directed mutagenesis experiments, as the reference states for the two quantities are quite different. To compare with experimental values of ÁÁG , structures or accurate models must be available of the mutant in both the free and complexed forms, which can then be used in calculation of the mutant binding energetics.

Materials and Methods
Materials High-purity PPE, purchased from Elastin Products Company (Owensville, MO), was used without further puri®cation. OMTKY3 was puri®ed either directly from turkey egg-whites or from commercially available crude turkey ovomucoid (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) following published procedures (Swint & Robertson, 1993). PPE concentrations were determined using an extinction coef®cient of 5.2 Â 104 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 280 nm (Shotton, 1970) and OMTKY3 concentrations determined at pH 7 using an extinction coef®cient of 4.4 Â 103 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 280 nm (Swint & Robertson, 1993). Protein concentrations were determined in triplicate and the average result used. Isothermal titration calorimetry Prior to an ITC experiment, protein solutions were dialyzed overnight at 4 C against 4 l of buffer. Buffer concentrations ranged from 50 to 150 mM; counter-ions were either sodium or chloride depending upon the buffer. For experiments at temperatures other than 25 C, buffers were made such that the solution was at the desired pH at the experimental temperature, ensuring constant pH across the temperature ranges studied. This was performed by calculating the pKa of the buffer at the experimental temperature, using known values for ÁHb p,i and ÁCb (Christensen et al., 1976), and determining the p,i requisite pH at 25 C. The ITC experiments were performed using a Calorimetry Sciences Corporation model 4200 titration calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp., Pleaseant Grove, UT). The calorimeter was routinely calibrated with 1 mJ electrical pulses and by measuring the protonation enthalpy of Tris. OMTKY3 concentrations were typically near 1.5 mM and PPE concentrations near 150 mM. OMTKY3 solutions were degassed prior to use. The initial cell volume in the calorimeter was typically 1 ml and the injection volume 10 ml. To correct for heats of dilution and viscous mixing, the average heat of the post-saturation injections was subtracted from each injection. Because of dilution across the injection needle tip during the initial equilibration period, data for the ®rst injection were discarded. Data for the saturating injection were also discarded. On some occasions titrations were performed at pH values somewhat distant from the pKa of the buffer, for example, titrations performed in Tris buffer (pKa of 8.1 at 25 C) at pH 6.0. From the results of the global analysis, the value of NH can be calculated at any pH. With this value and given solution conditions (pH, temperature, buffer, and buffer concentration), it is possible to calculate the fraction of NH that is buffered and the subsequent change in pH during the titration (see Doyle et al., 1995). Under all experimental conditions studied, the change in pH was determined to be negligible. ITC data analysis As binding was stoichiometric under all conditions studied, the value of ÁH for each individual injection obs (the integrated area of a single peak divided by the moles injected) in an ITC experiment was used as a datum point. The individual values of ÁH were ®t obs versus ÁHb, pH and temperature to Equation (7), includi ing all necessary temperature-dependencies. Fitting was

Conclusion
We have presented a detailed thermodynamic study of the binding of OMTKY3 to PPE. While the binding of OMTKY3 is insensitive to added salt (up to 100 mM), it involves proton linkage, arising from a shift in the pKa of histidine 57 in the protease active site. This shift is important for the catalytic activity of the enzyme, and because of it, the binding energetics (i.e. the free energy, enthalpy, entropy and heat capacity changes) are strongly dependent upon solution conditions. These dependencies underscore the need to thoroughly investigate linked equilibria before any comparison of experimental energetics with those calculated from structural information can be made. Through a global analysis, the intrinsic binding energetics have been determined, as have the energetics associated with the pKa shift. The energetics of the pKa shift are consistent with the desolvation of His57 upon OMTKY3 binding, and will be of use in interpreting the thermodynamic basis for altered pKa values in proteins. Structurebased thermodynamic calculations of the binding energetics have been performed, and these are directly comparable to the experimental, intrinsic binding energetics. We ®nd very good agreement between the two, which emphasizes the accuracy of the calculations and re¯ects current understanding of the thermodynamic determinants of molecular recognition. Studies designed to further this understanding and to increase the accuracy and applicability of the calculations are in progress.

performed using the non-linear least-squares ®tting program NONLIN (Michael L. Johnson, University of Virginia). Molecular modeling The complex between OMTKY3 and PPE was modeled by superimposing the coordinates for PPE (PDB entry 3est: Meyer et al., 1988) onto the coordinates of HLE in the HLE-OMTKY3 structure (PDB entry 1ppf: Bode et al., 1986). Residues in PPE identical with those HLE residues in the protein-protein interface were used for the superimposition. The HLE interfacial residues were determined from measurements of changes in accessible surface as described below. Those with identical counterparts in PPE are His40, Cys42, His57, Cys58, Leu143, Cys191, Gly193, Ser195, Ser214, Phe215, Val216 and Gly219. These residues superimpose to a root-meanÊ Ê square deviation of 0.72 A using all atoms and 0.48 A using the peptide backbone. After superimposition, HLE was deleted, leaving an initial PPE-OMTKY3 structure. Protons were added, and the structure was minimized with 100 iterations of conjugate-gradient minimization using the AMBER all-atom force®eld (Weiner et al., 1984) as implemented in Sybyl 6.2 (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO). As controls, the crystal structures for the HLE-OMTKY3, aCT-OMTKY3 and SGPB-OMTKY3 complexes were subjected to the same minimization scheme, and only minor changes were observed in the proteins and interfaces. Structure-based thermodynamic calculations Structure-based calculations were performed using a previously published empirical parameterization based largely upon changes in polar and apolar surface area (Murphy & Freire, 1992; Xie & Freire, 1994). The calculations as performed here do not include any protonlinked effects, and are thus comparable only with the experimentally determined intrinsic energetics. Central to the calculations is the value of ÁCp, calculated as: ÁCp  aÁASAp  bÁASApol Ê where a is 1.88 J KÀ1 molÀ1 AÀ2 and b is À1.09 J KÀ1 Ê molÀ1 AÀ2 (Murphy & Freire, 1992). ÁH at 60 C was calculated as: ÁH 60 g  cÁASApol  dÁASAp Ê Ê where c is 131 J mol AÀ2 and d is À35.3 J molÀ1 AÀ2 (Xie & Freire, 1994). The calculation was performed at 60 C, the median unfolding temperature of the proteins in the set from which the parameters were derived (Murphy & Freire, 1992; Xie & Freire, 1994). ÁH at 25 C is calculated using the calculated value for ÁCp. The total entropy change upon binding was calculated as the sum of three terms: a solvation term (ÁS ), a solv conformational term (ÁS ), and a mixing (or cratic) conf term (ÁS ). The entropy of polar and apolar solvation mix is close to zero near 385 K (Baldwin, 1986; Murphy et al., 1990; Murphy, 1994) and thus ÁS at 25 C is given as: solv   298X15 ÁS  ÁCp ln solv 385X15

ÁS was calsc mix culated as a ``cratic'' term, a statistical correction that re¯ects the mixing of solute and solvent molecules (Gurney, 1953), and effectively accounts for the entropy change due to changes in translational/rotational degrees of freedom (Murphy et al., 1994). For a bimolecular binding reaction using a 1 M standard state, this equates to:   1 ÁS  R ln mix 55X5 For the calculations above, measurements of accessible surface areas were performed using the program ACCESS (Scott R. Presnell, Zymogenetics, Seattle, WA), an implementation of the Lee and Richards solvent-accessibility algorithm (Lee & Richards, 1971), using a probe raÊ Ê dius of 1.4 A and a slice width of 0.25 A. As the binding is well approximated as a rigid-body interaction (Read & James, 1986), the coordinates of the free proteins were extracted from those of the complex.

Note added in proof : Professor L. Mario Amzel has recently shown, using the cell model of liquids, that the loss of translational entropy upon binding a ligand to a protein is quantitatively very close to that estimated from the cratic term (Amzel, L. M. (1997). Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. In the press). The small difference between the ``cell model'' calculation and the cratic term does not affect our results.
