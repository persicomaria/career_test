ABSTRACT: A technique was developed to evaluate whether electron transfer (ET) complexes formed in solution by the cloned cytochrome c peroxidase [CcP(MI)] and cytochromes c from yeast (yCc) and horse (hCc) are structurally similar to those seen in the respective crystal structures. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert the sole Cys of the parent enzyme (Cys 128) to Ala, and a Cys residue was introduced at position 193 of CcP(MI), the point of closest contact between CcP(MI) and yCc in the crystal structure. Cys 193 was then modified with a bulky sulfhydryl reagent, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB), to prevent yCc from binding at the site seen in the crystal. The MPB modification has no effect on overall enzyme structure but causes 20-100-fold decreases in transient and steady-state ET reaction rates with yCc. The MPB modification causes only 2-3-fold decreases in ET reaction rates with hCc, however. This differential effect is predicted by modeling studies based on the crystal structures and indicates that solution phase ET complexes closely resemble the crystalline complexes. The low rate of catalysis of the MPB-enzyme was constant for yCc in buffers of 20-160 mM ionic strength. This indicates that the low affinity complex formed between CcP(MI) and yCc at low ionic strength is not reactive in ET.

The cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP)1 :cytochrome c (Cc) redox pair has been widely studied as a model for long

distance electron transfer (ET) reactions. The reaction of peroxide with ferric CcP converts the enzyme to compound I (Bosshard et al., 1990), which has two oxidized sites: an oxy-ferryl heme (FeIVdO) and a stable free radical at Trp 191 (Trp·,+). ET from CcII reduces both oxidized sites of compound I rapidly, despite a separation of g17 Å between the hemes of CcP and Cc (Pelletier & Kraut, 1992; Finzel et al., 1984). The mechanism of compound I reduction is a matter of ongoing debate. A large body of evidence indicates that

Accelerated Publications structure (Miller et al., 1994; Wang & Margoliash, 1995; Pappa & Poulos, 1995), but these studies have not resolved between the one- and two-site mechanisms. Toward this end, we created a double mutant of CcP(MI) in which the single cysteine (Cys 128) of the parent enzyme was mutated to Ala, and Ala 193 (the point of closest contact between CcP(MI) and yCc in the crystal structure was mutated to Cys. Cys 193 of the mutant was then modified with 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB), a bulky sulfhydryl reagent. The effect of this modification on transient and steady-state oxidation of yCc and hCc was then determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. Cytochromes c from bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cereVisiae) and horse (type VI) were obtained from Sigma and were used without further purification. 3-(NMaleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other materials were of reagent grade or better. Enzymes. Mutations were introduced into the CcP(MI) gene by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (Fishel et al. 1987). To create the double mutant enzyme, Cys 128 was first mutated to Ala. The CcP(MI,A128) enzyme was isolated and purified from cultures of Escherichia coli using procedures described elsewhere (Fishel et al., 1987). A second round of mutagenesis was used to convert Ala 193 to Cys. To purify CcP(MI,A128,C193), the free sulfhydryl at Cys 193 must be modified before adding heme to the enzyme. To accomplish this, the enzyme was purified from the crude bacterial homogenate in the presence of 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, apoenzyme was separated from heme-containing enzyme (Miller et al., 1994), the enzyme solution was adjusted to pH 7.6 with 1 N NaOH, and a 5-fold molar excess of MPB was added for 30 min at 4 °C. A standard DTNB assay (Habeeb, 1972) showed 0.91.1 mol of free sulfhydryl/mol of enzyme initially, and no free sulfhydryl after MPB treatment. Heme was added to the apo-MPB-enzyme by standard procedures (Fishel et al., 1987). Crystalline enzyme was dissolved in H2O/MeOH/ HOAc, 50:50:0.5, to a final concentration of 50 µM, and the samples were analyzed by the Scripps Research Institute Mass Spectrometry Facility, La Jolla, CA. Purified parental CcP(MI) contained a major species (84%) MW ) 33 727, and a minor species (16%) MW ) 33 595. This is consistent with the predicted molecular weight of 33 732 for CcP(MI) and 33 601 for enzyme lacking the N-terminal Met residue. The MPB double mutant contained two comparable species: a major one (73%) MW ) 34 252 and a second one (15%) MW ) 34 119. These two species are 524 and 525 mass units greater than the corresponding peaks of CcP(MI), respectively, in agreement with the predicted molecular weight of 524 for the MPB moiety. An additional minor component (7.7%), of molecular weight 34 033, was identified in the sample. This component is presumed to represent maleimidyl-enzyme that lacks the biotinyl moiety. The predicted molecular weight of such a species is 34 041. The 8 mass unit difference between the predicted and observed molecular weights of the minor species is statistically significant and indicates that a second modification must accompany loss of the biotinyl moiety. Details of the MPB double mutant enzyme crystal structure will be presented elsewhere (G. W. Han et al., manuscript

In Scheme 1, reduces initially, leaving the oxyferryl heme (eq 1). An internal ET reaction regenerates Trp·,+ and reduces the heme back to the ferric state (eq 2).2 A second molecule of CcII then reduces Trp·,+ to regenerate ferric CcP (eq 3) (Geren et al., 1991; Hahm et al., 1992, 1993, 1994; Liu et al., 1994). Consistent with Scheme 1, reduction of the oxyferryl heme is absolutely dependent on a readily oxidized Trp at position 191 (Mauro et al., 1988; Miller et al., 1995) and is influenced by the equilibrium between the oxy-ferryl heme and Trp·,+(Liu et al., 1994; Miller et al., 1994). Scheme 1 requires only one binding site for CcII and is consistent with the crystal structures of complexes formed between a cloned CcP [CcP(MI); Fishel et al., (1987)]3 and cytochromes c from horse and yeast (Pelletier & Kraut, 1992). In these complexes, Trp 191 is interposed between the hemes of CcP(MI) and Cc. Alternatives to Scheme 1 have been proposed. Stoppedflow studies led Erman and co-workers to conclude that at low ionic strength CcII reduces the oxyferryl center of compound I first, then reduces Trp·,+ (Matthis et al., 1995; Nuevo et al., 1993; Summers & Erman, 1988). Independent reduction of the two oxidized sites without equilibration between the oxidized sites has also been proposed (Hazzard & Tollin, 1991; Kang et al., 1977). These mechanisms seem incompatible with the crystal structure of the CcP(MI):CcII complex, which predicts initial reduction of Trp·,+, but are supported by recent evidence for a second, low-affinity Cc binding site (Mauk et al., 1994; Kornblatt & English, 1986; Wang & Margoliash, 1995) if it is assumed that this site is highly reactive (Stemp & Hoffman, 1993; Zhou & Hoffman, 1993, 1994; Zhou et al., 1995). To elucidate the detailed mechanism of compound I reduction, the relationship between the high affinity CcP: Cc complexes in solution and the CcP(MI):Cc crystal structures must be established, and the possible contribution of a second Cc binding site must be evaluated. Preliminary results suggest that the high affinity complex between CcP and Cc in solution is similar to that seen in the crystal
2 It is important to note, however, that the ET rate from CcII to the oxy-ferryl heme is faster than the overall equilibrium between Trp 191 and the oxy-ferryl heme (eq 2) at pH g 7.0 (Liu et al., 1994; Ho et al., 1984). Under these conditions, a charge transfer state may replace the Trp 191 radical, or the indole ring may simply provide a medium for superexchange between the two hemes. This is discussed further in Miller et al. (1995). 3 We have distinguished explicitly between CcP from bakers' yeast and the cloned CcP(MI). The two enzymes are essentially identical in overall structure and function, but differ at position 53, which is Thr in CcP and Ile in CcP(MI), and at position 152, which is Asp in CcP and Gly in CcP(MI). CcP is used in cases where data exist for both enzymes.

FIGURE 1: Stereo model showing a predicted interaction of the MPB mutant CcP(MI) with yCc and hCc. A model of MPB-CcP(MI,A128,C193) was superimposed upon the coordinates for the backbone atoms of CcP(MI) in the CcP(MI):yCc complex (Pelletier & Kraut, 1992) using a least-squares minimization program. CcP(MI) and the malemidyl moiety at Cys 193 are shown in dark gray, Val 28 of yCc is shown in black, and Thr 28 of hCc is shown in white. Rotation of the Cys side chain about the CR-C bond produces two orientations for the MPB moiety that are favorable for CcP(MI) alone. When modeled in the CcP(MI):yCc crystal structure, the orientation shown here places the MPB moiety 1.6 Å from the predicted position of yCc-Val 28, but 5.5 Å from the predicted position of hCc-Thr 28. The model predicts even greater conflicts between the MPB moiety and yCc-Val 28 in the second orientation (not shown) but no conflicts with hCc are predicted.

in preparation). The MPB derivative was disordered in the crystal, presumably due to formation of both R- and Sisomers when the sulfhydryl of Cys 193 reacts with the maleimidyl moiety. The mutations have little effect on the overall fold of the enzyme, as the rms deviation of all backbone atoms in residues 2-294 from the CcP(MI) parent is 0.3 Å. The coordinates for the MPB mutant have been deposited in the Brookhaven Data Bank under the four letter access code 1CYF. Kinetics. Measurements of transient unimolecular and bimolecular ET rates were conducted according to established procedures, using Ru-bipy derivatives of hCc and yCc (Geren et al., 1991; Hahm et al., 1992, 1993, 1994; Liu et al., 1994, 1995). Steady-state kinetic measurements were made in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, adjusted to the desired ionic strength with NaCl, as described elsewhere (Miller et al., 1995). RESULTS Computer Simulations of CcP:Cc Complexes. The MPB moiety was disordered in the crystal structure (see Materials and Methods), so computer simulations were used to predict the effect of both MPB-Cys 193 isomers on the CcP(MI): yCc and CcP(MI):hCc complexes seen in the crystal (Pelletier & Kraut, 1992). Models were constructed using standard geometry constraints (Tronrud & Ten Eyck, 1987) and superimposed on the coordinates for CcP(MI) in the CcP(MI):yCc or CcP(MI):hCc complexes. These studies reveal that the maleimidyl ring of the MPB mutant causes severe steric conflicts within the CcP(MI):yCc complex (Figure 1). For both isomers, the maleimidyl ring makes close contacts with yCc side chains in all positions obtained by rotation of the MPB-Cys 193 side chain about the CR-C bond. Thus, the CcP(MI):yCc complex seen in the crystal cannot be formed when the maleimidyl group is attached. In contrast, steric conflicts are absent from the CcP(MI):hCc complex (Figure 1), because the distance between residue 193 of CcP(MI) and the hCc heme is much larger than the analogous distance in the CcP(MI):yCc complex (Pelletier & Kraut, 1992; Figure 2). Some conformations of the biocytinyl

moiety of MPB are predicted to cause conflicts with hCc, but these conflicts can be avoided by rotation about C-C bonds. Thus, the MPB moiety will not prevent formation of the CcP(MI):hCc complex seen in the crystal, but it may increase the free energy of the complex. Transient Kinetics of Compound I Reduction. The effect of the MPB moiety on ET was quantified by measuring intracomplex ET rates for CcP and the MPB mutant. Intracomplex ET from CcII to compound I is too fast to be measured by conventional mixing techniques but can be measured if compound I and CcIII are mixed prior to reduction of CcIII (Geren et al., 1991). This is accomplished by linking a ruthenium bipyridine moiety to yCc (Ru-yCc) or hCc (Ru-hCc) and photoreducing CcIII according to the mechanism shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 RuII-CcIII y z RuII*-CcIII a RuIII-CcII 9 RuII-CcII \ 8
A laser pulse excites RuII-CcIII to the luminescent triplet state, RuII*-CcIII, and the triplet RuII* ligand reduces the CcIII heme to form RuIII-CcII. When a sacrificial electron donor such as EDTA is included to prevent the back reaction to re-form RuII-CcIII, the intermediate RuII-CcII accumulates. When RuII-CcIII is mixed with compound I and photoexcited in the presence of EDTA, ET from the ferrous heme of RuIICcII to compound I can be followed via absorption spectroscopy, where oxidation of CcII is monitored at 550 nm, and reduction of the oxy-ferryl heme of compound I is monitored at 434 nm, which is an isosbestic point for CcII/ CcIII. This technique has shown that RuII-CcII first reduces Trp·,+ and then reduces the oxy-ferryl heme (Hahm et al., 1991). Intracomplex ET from yCcII to Trp·,+ of the MPB mutant and CcP was measured at low ionic strength (µ ) 3 mM), where essentially all of the Ru-Cc is complexed with compound I. When Ru39-yCc is the substrate, the rate constant for ET (ket) is 92-fold smaller for the MPB-mutant enzyme than for the CcP(MI) parent (Table 1). When Ru27hCc is the substrate, ket for the MPB mutant is only 2-fold

FIGURE 2: Structure models of the ET active binding modes for yCc and hCc at the surface of CcP(MI). The image was created by superimposing peptide backbone atoms of CcP(MI) from models of the crystalline CcP(MI):hCc and CcP(MI):yCc complexes (Pelletier & Kraut, 1992) with a least-squares minimization program. The ribbon trace for CcP(MI) is shown in gray, yCc is shown in white, and hCc is shown in black. In this view, hCc is rotated counterclockwise and then translated upward and into the Z-plane with respect yCc. (Panel A, top) Ribbon traces for yCc bound in Y-mode and hCc bound in H-mode. (Panel B, bottom) The positions of the yCc (black) and hCc (white) hemes are shown relative to CcP(MI) when bound in their respective modes. The CcP(MI)-Trp 191 side chain is shown in light gray.

binding of CcII to CcP is weaker and reduction of Trp·,+ as well as the oxy-ferryl heme can be completely resolved by stopped flow spectrophotometry (Geren et al., 1993). When compound I is mixed with yCcII or hCcII at high ionic strength, Trp·,+ is reduced initially, and the oxyferryl heme is reduced in a lagging phase. The bimolecular rate constants for reduction of Trp·,+ (ka) and the oxyferryl heme (kb) of the MPB mutant are 20-fold smaller than the CcP parent when yCcII is the donor, but were decreased by only 3fold when hCcII is the donor (Table 1). The bimolecular rate constants ka and kb are identical for Ru39-yCc and native yCc, which indicates that the decrease in ka is not caused by interaction of the ruthenium group attached to yCc with the MPB moiety. Thus, the MPB moiety dramatically decreases the ET rate within the CcP:yCc complex but has a much smaller effect on the ET rate within the CcP:hCc complex. Despite the small effect of the MPB moiety on ket, other evidence indicates that CcP(MI) and hCc interact near residue 193, as predicted by the crystal structure. When the dissociation rate constant (k5) and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd ) k5/k6) for the CcP(MI):Ru27-hCc complex (eq 4) were determined as described by Liu et al. (1995),

smaller than the CcP(MI) parent (Table 1). Intermolecular ET rates were also measured using unmodified CcII at high ionic strength (µ g 110 mM), where

the values for both parameters are significantly higher for the MPB mutant than for CcP (Table 2). This is consistent with perturbation of the CcP(MI):hCc complex by the MPBmoiety. The Ala 193 f Phe mutation also lowers the affinity of CcP(MI) for hCc (Liu et al., 1994; Erman et al., manuscript in preparation), further indicating that Ala 193 is near the interface of the CcP(MI):hCc complex. Steady-State Kinetics. We observed a strong correlation between the effect of the MPB moiety on transient ET rates and its effect on steady-state oxidation of yCcII and hCcII. Steady-state oxidation of yCcII is strongly dependent upon ionic strength (Matthis & Erman, 1995; Nuevo et al., 1993), and the effect of the MPB moiety must be considered in this context. For CcP(MI), V0 is a simple hyperbolic function

a The rate constants for the reaction cycle defined in the text were determined in solutions containing 5 µM Ru-27-Cc and 5 µM CcP or MPB-CcP(MI,A128,C193) in 2 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6, adjusted to the indicated ionic strength with 0-120 mM NaCl (Liu et al., 1995). No HOOH or aniline was added. The rate constant k4, which corresponds to reduction of the Trp 191 radical by CcII, was 6.1 × 104 s-1 for CcP and 3.0 × 104 s-1 for MPB-CcP(MI,A128,C193), independent of ionic strength. Experimental error in the reported values is (15%.

of yCc concentration above µ ) 100 mM (Figure 3A). Under these conditions, kcat  2200 s-1, and Km increases as µ is increased to 160 mM (Figure 4A,C). At µ < 100 mM, kcat decreases (Figure 4A), and a simple hyperbola no longer describes the data adequately. Between 90 mM > µ > 50 mM, the dependence of V0 upon yCcII concentration is best modeled as the sum of a hyperbola and a line. The values of kcat and Km for the saturable process decrease as the ionic strength decreases, while the slope of the line appears to be constant. At µ ) 40 mM, the hyperbolic process is saturated at 2 µM yCcII, giving a linear dependence of V0 on yCcII, with a Y-intercept at 50 s-1 (Figure 3B). As the ionic strength is further decreased, the data are best described as a hyperbola with a nonzero intercept. The value of the intercept declines to a value of 6 s-1 at µ ) 20 mM. At 20 mM e µ e 30 mM, the second process can be characterized as a hyperbola, with Km2  115 µM, and a maximal velocity kcat2  320 s-1 (Figure 3B). The change in the ionic strength dependence of kcat and the deviation from hyperbolic kinetics at µ < 110 mM are caused by a change in the rate-limiting step. Mutations at the CcP(MI):yCc interface increase kcat at low ionic strength, and lower the ionic strength at which the change in ratelimiting step occurs (M. A. Miller, unpublished observations). These observations indicate that when µ < 110 mM, enzyme turnover is limited by dissociation of yCc from CcP(MI). This is consistent with the observation that yCc dissociation is very slow at low ionic strength Yi et al. (1994).

Under conditions where kcat is limited by product dissociation, a second process contributes to yCcII oxidation. When µ > 30 mM, this process does not saturate at 80 µM yCcII and has a bimolecular rate constant of approximately 1.8 × 106 M-1 s-1. At 20 mM e µ e 30 mM, saturation of the second process occurs, suggesting that complex formation between CcP and yCc is involved. The value of kcat2 is larger than the rate constant for CcIII dissociation (k5) at low ionic strength (Yi et al., 1994). Thus, the second process must reflect either an increase in k5 by substrate-assisted displacement (Corin et al., 1993) or a mechanism where yCcII reacts with the CcP:yCcIII complex at low ionic strength. Results of experiments with a variety of CcP(MI) mutants indicate that the former possibility is correct (M. A. Miller, unpublished observations). The effect of the MPB moiety on steady-state oxidation of yCcII is consistent with this interpretation. The MPB moiety decreases the value of kcat to 31 ( 1 s-1 (Figure 4A). The decrease in kcat at 110 mM ionic strength is of the same magnitude as the decrease in the transient electron transfer rate, ket (Table 1). This indicates that electron transfer from the high affinity binding site is rate-limiting under these conditions. The MPB moiety also makes kcat independent of ionic strength from µ ) 20 mM to µ ) 160 mM, indicating that dissociation of yCcIII is not rate-limiting for the MPB mutant enzyme. Steady-state oxidation of hCcII by CcP(MI) can be described by a simple hyperbolic function at all ionic strengths. The value of kcat is 250 ( 20 s-1, independent of ionic strength (Figure 4B). The value of Km decreases monotonically with decreasing ionic strength, from 30 µM at µ ) 110 mM to 1.5 µM at µ ) 20 mM (Figure 4D). The MPB enzyme has a similar ionic strength dependence: kcat ) 115 ( 5 s-1 (Figure 4B) and Km decreases monotonically from 30 µM at µ ) 110 mM to 1 µM at µ ) 20 mM (Figure 4D). The ionic strength independence of kcat for both enzymes is consistent with rapid dissociation of hCcIII from CcP at low ionic strength (Yi et al., 1994). DISCUSSION The transient ET reactions measured using Ru-Cc and stopped-flow techniques are clearly relevant for steady-state oxidation of yCcII and hCcII. When yCcII is the substrate, the 92-fold decrease in ket for the MPB-mutant relative to CcP is accompanied by a 67-fold decrease in kcat under conditions where electron transfer is rate-limiting. When hCcII is the substrate, electron transfer is also rate limiting, since the 2-fold decrease in ket for the MPB-mutant causes a 2-fold decrease in kcat.

672 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 3, 1996 The relationship between ket and kcat can be interpreted in the context of Scheme 1.4 Single turnover experiments indicate that the initial reduction of Trp·,+ is rapid, and the subsequent reduction of the oxyferryl heme is rate-limiting. Reduction of the oxyferryl heme occurs by a twostep mechanism: in the first step, a rapid equilibrium is established between the oxy-ferryl heme and Trp·,+ (eq 2).2 In the second step, rate-limiting ET from yCcII to Trp·,+ returns the enzyme to the resting ferric state (eq 3). The rate constant for this reaction (kobs) is a function of the equilibrium constant for CcP(MI):yCc complex formation (KA), the equilibrium constant for formation of Trp·,+ (KFR in eq 2), and the rate of intracomplex ET from yCc to Trp·,+ (ket). The relationship is given explicitly as follows:

Accelerated Publications yCc can bind in the H-mode, although hCc is unable to bind in the Y-mode. Binding of yCc in the H-mode is not detected in the CcP(MI) parent because the H-mode complex is less stable than the Y-mode complex. Binding of yCc is approximately 10-fold stronger than binding of hCc (Matthis & Erman, 1995; Krescheck et al., 1994), so if hCc and yCc have equal affinity in the H-mode, only 10% of the CcP: yCc complex will be in H-mode. This model for CcP:Cc interaction is significantly different from multisite models proposed by others (Zhou et al., 1995; Zhou & Hoffman, 1993, 1994; Stemp & Hoffman, 1993) because it predicts one well-defined Cc binding site with two possible binding modes. These two binding modes are distinct but should not be viewed as rigid, since recent evidence indicates that two-dimensional diffusion of hCc about CcP is required to achieve a productive ET complex (F. Millett, unpublished observations). Thus, the two binding modes in the crystal represent the energy minima for equilibrium binding of the respective cytochromes, but the orientation of Cc may change before ET occurs. The kinetic results require that the observed ET rate is determined by the initial mode of Cc binding, however. These data show that physiological ET occurs at the high affinity Cc binding site. This can be reconciled with evidence for a reactive high affinity binding site in covalently cross-linked CcP:Cc complexes (Wang & Margoliash, 1995; Pappa & Poulos, 1995) but differs markedly from results obtained when ET is measured with Zn-heme substituted Cc [Zn(por)-Cc] or CcP [Zn(por)-CcP] (Zhou et al., 1995; Zhou & Hoffman, 1993, 1994; Stemp & Hoffman, 1993). The latter studies report low ET reactivity at the high affinity Cc binding site and high ET reactivity at a second, low affinity binding site. It seems likely that this discrepancy is caused by the effect of Zn substitution on the pathway and reorganization energies for the ET reactions. When quenching of photoexcited 3Zn-Cc by CcPIII is used to measure ET, oxidation of Trp 191 does not occur, and therefore the physiological ET pathway does not operate (Zhou & Hoffman, 1993; Stemp & Hoffman, 1993). When ET from CcII to a Zn porphyrin radical [Zn(por,)-CcP] is measured (Zhou & Hoffman, 1994), activation of the physiological pathway only occurs to the extent that Zn(por,) can oxidize Trp 191. The oxidation potential for Zn(por,) is 0.25 V lower than for the oxy-ferryl heme (Kaneko et al., 1980). Assuming that equilibrium between Zn(por,) and Trp 191 is rapid relative to ET from yCc, Zn-heme substitution will shift the equilibrium constant KFR in eq 2 104-fold to the left (that is, KFR(Zn)/ KFR(Fe) ) 10-4). Thus Zn-heme substitution will decrease kobs in eq 5 by 104. It is also significant that the reorganization energy for reduction of the oxyferryl heme is much higher than that for Zn(por,) reduction (Gray & Malmstrom, 1989). The relatively high reorganization ¨ energy for reduction of the oxyferryl heme may actually prevent competing ET reactions of the type measured using Zn-hemes. This could explain the evolutionary selection of iron porphyrins for use in enzymes designed to prevent random discharge of a highly oxidized metal center. The results provide no evidence that a second, low affinity Cc binding site contributes to ET from yCcII to CcP(MI). The value of kcat for yCcII oxidation by the MPB mutant enzyme is constant down to 20 mM ionic strength, where the putative low-affinity Cc binding site is expected to contribute significantly to kcat (Zhou & Hoffman, 1994).

Equation 5 predicts that changes in ket will cause changes of equal magnitude in kobs. The value of kobs is much smaller than ket because the limiting intermediate [CcP(MI)III; Trp+,·: yCcII] is a small fraction of the total enzyme population. Under steady-state conditions, kobs is the theoretical upper limit for kcat. The observed value of kcat will be less than kobs to the extent that equilibrium binding of yCcII and yCcIII to compound I, compound II, and CcP(MI)III lower the concentration of the reactive [CcP(MI)III; Trp+,·:yCcII] complex in solution. The effect of the MPB moiety on transient and steadystate ET rates indicates that the solution phase ET complexes closely resemble the crystalline CcP(MI):Cc complexes. For the purposes of this discussion, we will define the region of interaction between CcP(MI) and Cc in the crystal structures as a binding site. In the crystal structures, yCc and hCc bind at the same site, but in two distinct orientations, which we shall define as Y-mode and H-mode, respectively. The two modes were thought to arise from differences in crystallization conditions (Pelletier & Kraut, 1992), but the present work indicates that these two modes are also relevant in solution. Thus, the crystal structures retain subtle differences between the CcP(MI):hCc and CcP(MI):yCc complexes that occur in solution (Figure 2A). ET from yCcII is highly efficient, with ket ) 1.2 × 106 s-1. This is consistent with Y-mode binding, where the yCc heme is 4 Å from Ala 193 of CcP(MI) and 13 Å from Trp 191 (Figure 2B). ET from hCcII is 20-fold slower, consistent with H-mode binding, where the distance from the hCc heme to Ala 193 of CcP(MI) and Trp 191 is increased by 6 Å (Figure 2B). An important prediction of our model is that the MPB moiety will prevent binding in the Y-mode but not binding in the H-mode. Our results are consistent with this prediction: ket, kcat, and kcat/Km for the reaction of yCcII with the MPB enzyme are all within 4-fold of those observed for hCcII (Table 1), suggesting that the residual activity of yCcII with the MPB-mutant is the result of binding in H-mode. Thus,
4 The mechanism in Scheme 1 cannot be readily reconciled with stopped-flow data suggesting that yCcII reduces the oxy-ferryl heme before Trp·,+ (Matthis et al., 1995). While the reaction observed in the stopped-flow experiment is consistent with oxidation of 2 mol of yCcII per mol of compound I, reduction of Trp·,+ observed by other techniques cannot be ruled out because the reaction is complete before the stopped flow measurements begin.

Accelerated Publications is probable that the second, low affinity binding site for yCc (Mauk et al., 1994) plays a non-ET role in the catalytic mechanism of CcP, however. The phenomena of substrateassisted displacement (Yi et al., 1994) and the unusual ionic strength dependence of kcat and Km for yCcII oxidation by CcP (Figure 3; Matthis & Erman, 1995) can be explained by assuming that yCc binding at the low affinity site increases the rate of dissociation at the high affinity site (Corin et al., 1993). The existence of this unreactive binding site is probably serendipitous, since it does not contribute to catalysis at physiological ionic strength (Tollin et al., 1993).
