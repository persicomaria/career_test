Background: The 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are divided into two classes, I and II. The 10 class I synthetases are considered to have in common the catalytic domain structure based on the Rossmann fold, which is totally different from the class II catalytic domain structure. The class I synthetases are further divided into three subclasses, a, b and c, according to sequence homology. No conserved structural features for tRNA recognition by class I synthetases have been established. Results: We determined the crystal structure of the class Ia methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) at 2.0 Å resolution, using MetRS from an extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB8. The T. thermophilus MetRS structure is in full agreement with the biochemical and genetic data from Escherichia coli MetRS. The conserved `anticodon-binding' residues are spatially clustered on an -helix-bundle domain. The Rossmann-fold and anticodon-binding domains are connected by a ­­­­ topology (`SC fold') domain that contains the class I specific KMSKS motif. Conclusions: The -helix-bundle domain identified in the MetRS structure is the signature of the class Ia enzymes, as it was also identified in the class Ia structures of the isoleucyl- and arginyl-tRNA synthetases. The ­­­­ topology domain, which can now be identified in all known structures of the class Ia and Ib synthetases, is likely to dock with the inner side of the L-shaped tRNA, thereby positioning the anticodon stem.

Introduction
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the aminoacylation reaction, which is considered to proceed in two steps: first the amino acid and ATP form an aminoacylAMP, and then the aminoacyl moiety is transferred to the 3-terminal adenosine of the tRNA. The 20 synthetases are divided into two classes, I and II (each consisting of 10 members), which must have evolved from two distinct ancestors [1]. The class I enzymes have two motifs, with consensus sequences of His­Ile­Gly­His (HIGH; in single-letter amino acid code) and Lys­Met­Ser­Lys­Ser (KMSKS) [1]. The 10 class I enzymes are further divided into three subclasses (classes Ia, Ib and Ic) on the basis of sequence homology [1­3]. Class Ia consists of the methionyl-, isoleucyl, valyl-, leucyl, cysteinyl- and arginyl-tRNA synthetases (MetRS, IleRS, ValRS, LeuRS, CysRS and ArgRS, respectively); class Ib consists of the glutaminyl- and glutamyl-tRNA synthetases (GlnRS and GluRS, respectively); and class Ic consists of

the tyrosyl- and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases (TyrRS and TrpRS, respectively). The crystal structures have been reported for Bacillus stearothermophilus TyrRS [4] and TrpRS [5], Escherichia coli GlnRS [6] and MetRS [7], Thermus thermophilus GluRS [8] and IleRS [9], Staphylococcus aureus IleRS [10] and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ArgRS [3]. The catalytic domains of the class I synthetases are characterized by a dinucleotidebinding or Rossmann fold, which consists of five parallel  strands that are connected by  helices. TyrRS and TrpRS in class Ic are dimeric, which is essential to their enzymatic activities: one cognate tRNA molecule interacts with the N-terminal region of one subunit and the C-terminal region of the other subunit in the 2 dimer [4,5]. On the other hand, the class Ia and class Ib enzymes are monomeric [3,6,8,9], except for MetRS, which is normally in a homodimeric form. The monomeric E. coli and T. thermophilus MetRS fragments lacking the dimerization

domain are nearly fully active [11­13]. The tRNA-binding mechanisms of the class Ia/Ib (monomeric) enzymes must, therefore, be distinct from those of the class Ic (dimeric) enzymes. Only two tRNA-complexed class I enzyme structures have been reported [6,10], whereas a number of tRNA-bound structures have been determined for the class II enzymes [14­18]. In the complex of E. coli GlnRS (class Ib) and tRNAGln, the CCA and anticodon arms of tRNAGln interact with the N-terminal Rossmann-fold domain and the C-terminal -barrel domains, respectively [6]. The other class 1 complex is the recently reported structure of a complex of S. aureus IleRS and tRNAIle, which is not a normal complex but an `editing complex' with the CCA terminus of the tRNA to be bound with the editing active site 34 Å away from the aminoacylation active site of IleRS [10]. As no other tRNA­enzyme complex structure is available, it remains to be elucidated which RNA-binding mechanisms are conserved for the other class Ia/Ib enzymes. For example, the anticodonbinding domains of GlnRS are completely replaced by other domains in the GluRS structure [8] of the same subclass (class Ib), suggesting that the class I enzymes have a variety of anticodon-recognition mechanisms. Although a crystal structure of E. coli MetRS in a monomeric form was reported on the basis of diffraction data at 2.5 Å resolution [7], the polypeptide-chain tracing cannot adequately explain the large amount of data accumulated by biochemical and mutagenesis studies of tRNA recognition and zinc binding by the E. coli MetRS [19­24]. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of T. thermophilus MetRS in the monomeric form (Mr 58,128) at 2.0 Å resolution, which is consistent with the tRNA recognition and zinc-binding data of the E. coli and T. thermophilus MetRS enzymes [19­26]. This allowed us to make a systematic comparison between the structures of all three subclasses. Thus, we can now unambiguously define two RNA-binding modules: one RNA-binding domain is conserved throughout the class Ia/Ib enzymes, and the other domain is conserved in the class Ia enzymes.

residues 1­502, Mr 58,128) corresponding to the T1­T2 tryptic fragment. The recombinant monomeric form, lacking the dimerization domain, of T. thermophilus MetRS was overexpressed in E. coli strain JM109(DE3), and was purified by heat treatment (at 70°C for 30 minutes) and sequential chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and Phenyl Superose fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) columns. The structure was determined using multiple isomorphous replacement, and the selenomethionylated protein contributed mainly to the phase determination. The atomic model, including residues 1­500 and 136 water molecules, was refined for 31,858 reflections at 6.0­2.0 Å resolution. The last two residues at the C-terminal end could not be observed in the electron-density map. The final crystallographic R factor was 21.0%, and the Rfree was 29.1% (Table 1). The structure of the monomeric T. thermophilus MetRS is an elongated ellipsoid, with dimensions of 50 × 35 × 90 Å (Figure 1a). The structure is inconsistent with the previous chain-tracing of the crystal structure of E. coli MetRS [7], except for approximately 120 amino acid residues from the N terminus to the end of the 4 strand (Figures 1a,b). In contrast, a new electron-density map of E. coli MetRS has successfully been chain-traced using the present T. thermophilus MetRS structure as a guide, indicating that the E. coli and T. thermophilus MetRS structures are in fact very similar to each other [28].
The Rossmann-fold domain

Results and discussion
Structure determination

The Rossmann-fold domain of T. thermophilus MetRS is formed by two polypeptide segments (residues 1­113 and 232­287; colored in orange in Figures 1b and 2) separated by an insertion (residues 114­231; described later in detail). The C terminus of the MetRS Rossmann-fold domain was determined to be Gly287, which might require the corresponding redefinition of the domain boundaries for the reported class Ia/Ib enzyme structures [3,6,8,9], as follows. In the present MetRS structure, Gly287 is the last residue of the fifth  strand (13) and forms a hydrogen bond between its backbone N­H group and the C=O group of Ile257 in the fourth strand (12) in the Rossmann-fold  sheet. The canonical -strand conformation of 13 ends at Gly287, as the C=O group of Gly287

First, we overproduced and purified the dimeric, full-length T. thermophilus MetRS (616 amino acid residues) as described [27], and tried to crystallize it. Two months after setting up the hanging drops, crystals appeared, which were resolved and evaluated using sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS­PAGE). Thus, the molecular mass of the crystallized protein was estimated to be approximately 58 kDa, which is quite consistent with the value of the T1­T2 fragment obtained by limited digestion with trypsin [11]. The T1­T2 tryptic fragment was found to be monomeric and nearly as active as the full-length protein in the aminoacylation reaction [11]. We therefore constructed an overexpression system of a fragment (amino acid

(b) Stereoview of a schematic drawing of the structure of T. thermophilus MetRS. The Rossmann-fold domain (shown in orange) characterizes the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The connective polypeptide (CP) domain consists of the antiparallel  sheet core (cyan), a MetRS-specific -strand insertion (green), the  ribbon with the zinc finger (yellow), and the antiparallel 2 helical structure (blue). The stem contact (SC) fold domain (red) is identified here as an RNA-binding domain. The -helixbundle domain (magenta) is the putative anticodon-binding domain. The C-terminal residues 467­500 (pink) in the present structure adopt a random coil, and are to be followed by a dimerization domain in the fulllength protein. The secondary structure elements are numerically labeled starting from the N terminus, as the  strands (1­15) and the  helices (1­17). The bound Zn2+ ion is represented as a yellow ball.

forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone N­H group of Lys259 in the lysine­aspartic-acid­isoleucine loop connecting 12 to 9. Then, the Rossmann-fold domain is connected to another domain through Gly288, which is not involved in any hydrogen-bonding interaction. In the previous reports on the class Ia/Ib enzyme structures [3,6,8,9], the fifth  strand of the Rossmann fold was considered to continue over the end of the hydrogen-bonding interaction with the fourth  strand. In all of these structures, however, we noticed that the canonical -strand conformation of the fifth  strand of the Rossmann fold is terminated at the same position as in T. thermophilus MetRS. The `last' Rossmann-fold residue forms a hydrogen bond

with the fourth  strand, and is usually followed by a glycine or a proline residue [3,6,8,9]. This glycine/proline linker is followed by another  strand, which had been interpreted to be an extension of the fifth  strand of the Rossmann fold, but is now proposed to be the first  strand of the next domain (the `SC-fold' domain, see later). As a result of systematic comparisons among all three subclasses (classes Ia, Ib and Ic) we propose that the  helix just following the N-terminal half of the Rossmann fold (4 in the present MetRS structure) can be included in the core of the Rossmann-fold domain because the  helix is common to all seven synthetase structures. In contrast

the actual sequence of which is His19­Leu20­Gly21­His22, is located in a loop between 1 and 1, with the two histidine residues stacked upon each other (Figure 3). This feature is conserved among all three class Ia synthetases (MetRS, IleRS and ArgRS), the two class Ib synthetases (GlnRS and GluRS), and the two class Ic synthetases (TyrRS and TrpRS) [4­6,8,9] (Figure 3). On the basis of the present domain-boundary assignments, the other catalytic motif, KMSKS, of the class I enzyme is not located in the Rossmann-fold domain, but is in the next domain (the `SC-fold' domain; see later).
The `connective polypeptide' domain

The present T. thermophilus MetRS structure has a domain (one continuous polypeptide segment consisting of residues 114­231) inserted between the N- and C-terminal halves of the Rossmann fold. Hereafter we denote this inserted domain as the `connective polypeptide' domain (or CP domain). In the previous incorrect structure of E. coli MetRS [7], this polypeptide was divided into two segments, CP1 and CP2, by the presence of a secondary structure element of the Rossmann fold in the middle. The present structure, however, unambiguously shows that the inserted segment is not divided in that manner, but is folded continuously and independently of the Rossmann fold. The CP domain of T. thermophilus MetRS consists mainly of an antiparallel  sheet (4­11, 5 and 6). The other class I enzyme structures also have an insertion (the CP domain) between the N- and C-terminal halves of the Rossmann fold. Based on a full comparison of these CPdomain structures, we define here the `CP-domain core' as a four-stranded antiparallel -sheet structure, which is conserved in all of the class Ia enzymes (MetRS, IleRS and ArgRS) and the class Ib enzymes (GlnRS and GluRS) (Figure 3). The CP-domain core of T. thermophilus MetRS consists of 4, 8, 9 and 11 (colored in cyan in Figures 1b and 2). The central, third strand (9) of the core antiparallel  sheet significantly kinks in the middle, which results in hydrophobic interactions inside. The yeast ArgRS exhibits the simplest CP domain, which has only the four-stranded CP-domain core. The corresponding domain of the T. thermophilus arginyl-tRNA synthetase also consists of four strands (AS et al., unpublished observations). In contrast, other CP domains have rather large insertions between the core  strands, as described later (Figure 3). On the other hand, the CP-domain structures of the class Ic enzymes (TyrRS and TrpRS), consisting of counterclockwise-arranged  helices that form a dimer interface [4,5], are completely different from the class Ia/Ib CP-domain structures (Figure 3). Between the first and second  strands (4 and 8) of the CP-domain core, an antiparallel  sheet (5, 6, and 7, colored yellow in Figures 1b and 2) is inserted. At the tip of this -sheet insertion, one Zn2+ ion is coordinated by an

Topology diagram of T. thermophilus MetRS; the  helices are represented by rectangles and the  strands by arrows. The numbers of the secondary structure elements and the color definitions for the domains are the same as those in Figure 1b. The bound Zn2+ ion and its ligands are represented as a yellow circle and black bars, respectively.

to the `33 plus 22' topology of the Rossmann-fold domains in classes Ib and Ic [4,5,6,8], an  helix (2) is inserted between 2 and 3 in the N-terminal half and 8 is inserted between 7 and 12 in the C-terminal half of the Rossmann fold (Figures 1b and 2). Similar insertions, consisting of three and one  helices, respectively, occur in the structures of T. thermophilus IleRS [9] and S. cerevisiae ArgRS [3] (Figure 3). We indicate, therefore, that these insertions are class Ia specific, although the strict numbers of  helices are not the same. The twist in the five-stranded parallel  sheet creates a deep catalytic cleft. The HIGH motif of T. thermophilus MetRS,

The class I specific Rossmann fold domains are also shown in gray. The class Ia/Ib specific antiparallel fourstranded  sheet (`the CP-domain core') is shown in cyan, and the inserts between the first and second  strands, between the second and third  strands, and between the third and fourth  strands of the antiparallel  sheet are shown in yellow, blue and green, respectively. In TyrRS and TrpRS the cyan antiparrallel  sheet is replaced by two short helices. A globular -barrel structure intervening between the zinc finger in IleRS is shown in pink.

appropriately oriented nitrogen and three sulfur atoms in the zinc finger motif, Cys127­X2­Cys130­X13­ Cys144­X2­His147 (where X is any amino acid). This zinc finger structure is essential for the aminoacylation activity of T. thermophilus MetRS [26]. The peptide conformation of this zinc-binding site of T. thermophilus MetRS is nearly the same as the solution structure of the zinc-binding fragment of E. coli MetRS [25], although the positions of these zinc-binding sites in the primary structures are not the same in the two enzymes [28]. This antiparallel -sheet insertion with a zinc-binding site is well conserved in the IleRS structure of the same subclass, class Ia [9]. As shown in Figure 3, IleRS has a zinc finger, Cys181­X2­Cys184­X204­ Cys389­X2­Cys392, at the tip of the  sheet insertion (yellow), which is essential for aminoacylation [29­31]. In IleRS, however, a 189-residue insert, folded into a globular  barrel structure (shown in pink in Figure 3), intervenes between the second and third cysteine residues of the zinc finger. This -barrel domain has been shown to function in the hydrolytic editing of Val­AMP and Val­tRNAIle [9,32]. In contrast, MetRS has no such editing activity. Furthermore, the class Ib structures of GlnRS and GluRS have polypeptide insertions with ­­ and ­­ topologies, respectively, between the first and second  strands of the CP-domain core. For this ­­ segment in a structural model of E. coli GluRS, a zinc-finger-like structure is

formed around the first  helix, and actually coordinates a functionally important Zn2+ ion [33]. Intriguingly, this Zn2+ ion in the E. coli GluRS structural model is located at a position quite similar to those of the Zn2+ ions in the T. thermophilus MetRS and IleRS structures. Between the second and third  strands (8 and 9), two antiparallel  helices (5 and 6), which run perpendicular to the  sheet of the Rossmann fold, are inserted (shown in blue in Figures 1b, 2 and 3). The loop connecting 5 and 6 forms two hydrogen bonds with 13 at the edge of the parallel  sheet of the Rossmann fold. Moreover, helices 5 and 6 are fixed by the hydrophobic interaction with the surface of the Rossmann fold. In the corresponding site between the second and third  strands of the CP-domain core, IleRS has an antiparallel pair of  helices, which is fixed hydrophobically on the Rossmann-fold domain, with the ­ loop anchored to the fifth  strand of the Rossmann fold by three hydrogen bonds (Figure 3). In contrast, GluRS has an antiparallel pair of  strands. Intriguingly, this  hairpin of GluRS is fixed hydrophobically on the Rossmann-fold domain, and the ­ loop is anchored to the fifth  strand of the Rossmann fold, in a similar manner to those in the MetRS and IleRS structures (Figure 3). On the other hand, GlnRS has a ` loop' (Figure 3), which is involved in disrupting the end of the tRNA acceptor stem [6]

202

Structure 2000, Vol 8 No 2

between the second and third strands of the CP-domain antiparallel  sheet. Between the third and fourth  strands (9 and 11) of the CP-domain core, a  strand (10; shown in green in Figures 1b, 2 and 3) is inserted and forms hydrogen bonds with 11 in an antiparallel manner. This -strand insertion is considered to be a MetRS-specific element. Between the corresponding  strands, IleRS has a much longer insertion with a ­­­­­ topology: a couple of antiparallel pairs of  strands face each other, and at their -turn ends two pairs of cysteine ligands are coordinated to the second Zn2+ ion (Figure 3).
The `stem contact fold' domain

As shown in Figures 1b and 2, the region that connects the N-terminal Rossmann-fold domain (shown in orange) and the C-terminal -helix-bundle domain (shown in magenta) has a ­­­­ topology (shown in red), and is tentatively designated as the ­­­­ domain. As described above, the N-terminal end of the ­­­­ domain (Phe289) is linked by Gly288 to the C-terminal end of the Rossmann-fold domain (Figure 4). The last  helix (12)
Figure 4

of the ­­­­ domain is nearly coaxial to the first  helix (13) of the -helix-bundle domain (Figure 4). These two  helices, however, are clearly separated by the Asp348­Leu349­Ala350­Asp351­ Asp352 segment (Figure 4) in an unusual conformation: the mainchain C=O group of Ala347 forms a hydrogen bond with the mainchain N­H group of Asp352(= 347 + 5), and the mainchain C=O group of Asp352 forms a hydrogen bond with the sidechain NH2 group of Asn415 in 15. The C-terminal end of the ­­­­ domain is Ala347. The secondary structure elements of the ­­­­ domain tightly interact within the globule. The two  strands (14 and 15) of the ­­­­ domain form a short parallel  sheet. The three  helices (10, 11 and 12) are perpendicularly arranged relative to each other. These secondary structure elements are tightly packed through a hydrophobic core made up of eleven residues including six leucine and three tyrosine residues. On the other hand, it is primarily 11 that contacts the N-terminal Rossmann-fold domain and the C-terminal -helix-bundle domain (Figure 1). The Rossmann-fold domain interacts with four sidechains of the ­­­­ domain and, to a similar extent, with five sidechains of the -helix-bundle domain.

Schematic representations of the structures of the ­­­­ domain of T. thermophilus MetRS and the corresponding regions of IleRS and ArgRS (class Ia), GlnRS and GluRS (class Ib), and TyrRS and TrpRS (class Ic), indicated in red (viewed from the same direction as in Figure 1b). For the MetRS structure (stereoview), in addition to the ­­­­ domain (ribbon diagram), the linker regions connecting this domain to the N-terminal Rossmann-fold domain and the C-terminal -helix-bundle domain are shown in ball-and-stick representation. The fold of this ­­­­ domain is named the stem contact (SC) fold. The SC-fold domain is conserved very well in other class Ia/Ib synthetases, IleRS, ArgRS, GlnRS and GluRS (the first and the last residues in the domain are numbered). In the long loop between the first  strand and the first  helix of the SC fold, there is the `KMSKS' motif, shown in balland-stick representation. In contrast, the class Ic synthetases (TyrRS and TrpRS) do not have the SC fold; the long loop with the KMSKS motif does not form a particular fold, and is followed by the C-terminal domain with a totally different topology (­­­), which might be involved in the anticodon binding. In the B. stearothermophilus TyrRS structure the sidechains of Lys230, Lys233 and Thr234, of the KMSKS motif, and of Lys230­Phe231­ Gly232­Lys233­Thr234 are missing.

On the basis of the characteristic boundary and hydrophobic-core structures of the ­­­­ domain, we found that a homologous topology is well conserved in the class Ia and class Ib synthetases (IleRS, ArgRS, GlnRS and GluRS; Figure 4) [3,6,8,9], although these polypeptide segments had never been described as structural domains. The glycine/proline linker structure at the boundary between the Rossmann-fold and ­­­­ domains is well conserved, as described above. The last  helix of the ­­­­ domain is followed by a short linker segment that clearly separates this domain from the anticodonbinding domain, whereas the anticodon-binding domain structures are totally different among MetRS/IleRS/ ArgRS, GlnRS and GluRS, as described below. The hydrophobic interactions among the secondary structure elements within the ­­­­ domain are more extensive than the contacts of this domain with the N- and C-terminal domains. Our sequence alignment suggests that the hydrophobic-core residues of the class Ia MetRS/IleRS/ ­­­­ domain are well conserved in the three remaining class Ia synthetases, ValRS, LeuRS and CysRS (not shown). On the other hand, in the class Ic synthetase structures, the Rossmann fold is followed by a long loop and a domain with an ­­­ topology, which is different from those of the ­­­­ domains of the class Ia/Ib synthetases [4,5] (Figure 4). The ­­­­ domain is characteristic of the monomeric class Ia/Ib synthetases. On the other hand, the ­­­ domain might be suggested to be the anticodon-binding domain of the class Ic, dimeric TyrRS/TrpRS. The crystal structure of the E. coli GlnRS­tRNAGln complex reveals that the ­­­­ domain (a part of it is named as the connective subdomain in [34,35]) interacts with the acceptor, D (dihydrouridine), and anticodon stems of the tRNA [6]. The Glu323 residue in the loop, corresponding to that between 15 and 12 of MetRS, contacts the highly conserved G10­C25 base pair of the tRNA [6]. The ­­­­ topology of this domain is, therefore, denoted hereafter as the `stem contact' (SC) fold. On the basis of the GlnRS­tRNAGln structure, a synthetase­tRNA docking model can be made, in which the SC-fold domain broadly contacts the D stem and the terminal region of the anticodon stem (the inner side of the L-shaped tRNA structure) and the C-terminal domain recognizes the anticodon of the tRNA (Figure 5). The SC-fold domain is connected with the Rossmann-fold and anticodon-binding -helix-bundle domains, through two short hinges (Figures 1 and 4). Thus, the SC-fold domain might have a common function of docking the inner side of the L-shaped tRNA so as to present precisely the anticodon trinucleotides to the proper recognition site of the enzyme. Because most of the identity determinants of the tRNA have been identified outside of the inner side of the L shape, the putative contact of the SC-fold domain with the tRNA might depend on the shape of the RNA stem, but

On tRNAMet, the discriminator A73, the enzyme-contact nucleotides on the inner side of the L-shaped tRNA, and the anticodon trinucleotides are colored in orange, red, and magenta, respectively. Correspondingly, on MetRS, the Rossmann-fold, SC-fold, and anticodon-binding domains are in orange, red and magenta, respectively. The bound Zn2+ ion is represented as a yellow ball. This model was constructed by superposition of the Rossmann-fold domain of the T. thermophilus MetRS structure onto that of the E. coli GlnRS­tRNAGln complex structure [6], followed by removal of the GlnRS structure. This figure was prepared using the program Insight II [53].

not so much on the nucleotide sequence in the contact region. A number of water molecules might be released when the SC-fold domain fits into the inner-side surface of the L-shaped tRNA. On the other hand, we now point out that the class IIb enzyme structures (AspRS, AsnRS and LysRS) have a subdomain with a well-conserved fold, the topology of which is different from that of the class I SC fold, for the contact with the inner side of the L-shaped tRNA. It is intriguing that the two different folds serve as a domain connecting the catalytic and anticodon-binding domains and contacting the inner side of the tRNA. The KMSKS motif, Lys297­ Met298­Ser299­Lys300­ Thr301, is situated around a  turn in the loop between 14 and 10 in the SC-fold domain of T. thermophilus MetRS (Figure 4). The hydrophobic part of the Lys297 sidechain interacts with the phenyl ring of Phe289 (Figure 4). As the KMSKS motif is considered to contribute to the catalytic site, the SC-fold domain carrying this motif might link the

204

tRNA binding to the catalytic-site activity. In this context, the 15­12 of the MetRS SC-fold domain corresponds to the ­ segment that was proposed (as a result of genetic studies) to transmit the signal of the anticodon recognition to the catalytic site of E. coli GlnRS [35], whereas the polypeptide chain corresponding to the SC-fold domain was not regarded as a structural domain [6]. The conformation of the KMSKS loop region is well conserved in the structures of IleRS (class Ia) and GluRS (class Ib) in the substrate-free form [8,9] (Figure 4). On the other hand, the substrate-bound forms of the class Ia/Ib enzymes, such as tRNAGln­GlnRS­ATP [6] and ArgRS­arginine [3], exhibited KMSKS loop conformations different from those of MetRS, IleRS and GluRS (Figure 4). Large conformational changes of the KMSKS loop region should, therefore, occur upon binding with substrate(s). Moreover, in the present T. thermophilus MetRS structure, Tyr12 would cause a steric hindrance against ATP or Met­AMP in the putative catalytic site corresponding to that of tRNAGln­GlnRS­ATP. The conformational change of the KMSKS loop region is, therefore, likely to be induced upon substrate binding, which might also affect the properties of the region around the other catalytic motif, HIGH, of T. thermophilus MetRS. Such dynamic movement of the KMSKS loop might be related to the dynamic nature of the aminoacylation reaction, where the same catalytic site is used successively during the putative two-step mechanism, including aminoacyl­AMP formation in the absence of tRNA and the following transfer of the aminoacyl moiety of aminoacyl­AMP to the 3-end of tRNA. Soaking native T. thermophilus MetRS crystals in a solution containing ATP (or methionine) and co-crystallization from the solution of the protein and ATP (or methionine) were tried. The electron-density maps, however, showed no evidence of an ATP (or methionine) molecule. On the other hand, the dimeric class Ic enzymes have the KMSKS motif in a long loop just following the Rossmann-fold domain (Figure 4). The structures of TyrRS bound with Tyr or Tyr­AMP and TrpRS bound with Trp­AMP exhibited different KMSKS loop conformations, not only from the class Ia/Ib KMSKS loop conformations, but also from each other (Figure 4). For proteins other than the class Ia/Ib synthetases, we found no structure homologous to the SC-fold domain by the program Dali version 2.0 [36]. It is not, as yet, clear if any domain of the SC fold exists independently of the Rossmann fold, or if the SC fold is a C-terminal extension of the Rossmann fold. Nevertheless, we would propose that the SC-fold domain found in the class Ia/Ib synthetase structures is to be regarded as a structural domain because of the following reasons: first, the SC-fold domain has a clearly defined hydrophobic core; second, as described previously for T. thermophilus MetRS, the interaction of the SC-fold domain with the Rossmann-fold domain is as moderate as that between the Rossmann-fold and anticodon-binding domains; third, the position of the SC-fold domain relative

to the Rossmann-fold domain is different among the class Ia/Ib structures (data not shown), whereas the topology of the SC fold is well conserved. On the other hand, it should be noted here that the two class Ic synthetases lack the SC-fold domain and have the KMSKS motif in the loop following the Rossmann-fold domain. The SC-fold domain, therefore, might have originated from such a simple KMSKS loop and have evolved to the present complex form of the SC fold downstream of the Rossmann-fold catalytic domain. Otherwise, it is still possible that the ancient synthetase already had the SC-fold domain connecting the Rossmann-fold and anticodon-binding domains, and that the class Ic synthetases have lost the SC fold when they evolved to be dimeric. Anyway, the presence of the SC fold between the Rossmann-fold and anticodon-binding domains characterizes the class Ia/Ib synthetases. The -helix-rich cylindrical domain of T. thermophilus MetRS (residues 353­466, shown in magenta in Figures 1b and 2) is a bundle of five antiparallel  helices (13­17). The N-terminal end of this -helix-bundle domain is connected to the SC-fold domain through the characteristic linker structure (Figure 4). Thus, the three class Ia synthetases, MetRS, IleRS and ArgRS, have in common the -helix-bundle domain of the same topology (Figure 6). In the cases of MetRS and IleRS, the first  helix of the -helix-bundle domain is nearly co-axial to the last  helix of the SC-fold domain. Previous studies overlooked the characteristic turn structure between these two  helices, and therefore regarded them as one continuous  helix. In contrast, the two  helices of ArgRS are separated by a linker structure different from those of MetRS and IleRS, and are less co-axial [3]. The bundle-forming helices of T. thermophilus MetRS make rigid contacts through hydrophobic interactions between the sidechains of the leucine and valine residues that are clustered inside the -helix-bundle (data not shown). The 13 and 15 helices might constitute a recognition surface for the tRNA anticodon; the invariant Asn355 and Arg359 residues protruding from 13, and Trp424 in the loop connecting 15 and 16 come in close proximity (Figure 6). For E. coli MetRS, the corresponding Asn391, Arg395 and Trp461 residues have been shown using mutational analyses to recognize the three nucleotides of the tRNAMet anticodon [19­22]. In contrast, the previously reported structure of E. coli MetRS [7] did not demonstrate the clustering of these functional residues. Now, we clearly show that the amino acid residues involved in the anticodon recognition are clustered on one face of the -helix-bundle domain in the T. thermophilus MetRS structure (Figure 7). The lower half of this anticodon-recognition surface is particularly hydrophobic, possibly for interacting with the bases, whereas the upper half is hydrophilic (Figure 7). In the T. thermophilus IleRS structure, the Arg726 residue, which corresponds to the

Figure 6 Schematic representations of the `anticodonbinding' -helix-bundle domains of the class Ia synthetases (MetRS, IleRS and ArgRS) viewed from the same direction as in Figure 1b. The first and the last residues in the domain are numbered. The amino acid residues that are important for the anticodon recognition by MetRS and IleRS are shown in ball-and-stick representation. Figures 3, 4 and 6 were prepared using the program Molscript [54] and Raster3D [55].

E. coli IleRS Arg734 residue involved in the recognition of the tRNAIle anticodon [37,38], is located in the same position as that of the anticodon recognizing the Trp424 residue of the T. thermophilus MetRS (Figure 6). The previous sequence alignment suggested that all of the class Ia synthetases have an -helical domain for therefore anticodon recognition [37], and this domain seems to be specific to class Ia synthetases. On the other hand, the two class Ib synthetases have different architectures in their anticodon-binding domains, which might be ascribed to their particular evolutionary scenario [8]: GlnRS has two -barrel domains [6,39], whereas GluRS exhibits two -helical domains [8]. A fivestranded  barrel structure, termed the oligonucleotide binding (OB) fold, is responsible for the anticodon recognition by class IIb enzymes, such as AspRS [14], AsnRS [40] and LysRS [16]. In the cases of HisRS and GlyRS, an / fold, comprising a five-stranded mixed  sheet surrounded

by three  helices, serves as the anticodon-recognition domain [41,42]. The RNA-binding domain of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) A folds into a fourstranded  sheet flanked on one side by two  helices, and recognizes the single-stranded loop region of a stem-loop RNA structure [43,44]. As compared with these RNAbinding modules, the anticodon-recognition -helixbundle domain of the class Ia aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is unique. In summary, the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have in common the Rossmann-fold domain (indicated in orange in Figures 1b and 2), and the class Ia and Ib synthetases have in common the CP-domain core (cyan) and the SCfold domain (red). The CP-domain core consists of a fourstranded antiparallel  sheet, and is inserted between the N- and C-terminal halves of the Rossmann-fold domain. Distinct subdomains (shown in yellow, blue and green in the figures) are inserted into the three ­ loops of the

CP-domain core. The SC-fold domain is located just after the Rossmann-fold domain and is followed by the anticodon-binding domain. The -helix-bundle anticodonbinding domain (magenta) characterizes the class Ia synthetases, whereas the class Ib synthetases, GlnRS and GluRS have distinct anticodon-binding domains.

Materials and methods
Preparation of the monomeric fragment of T. thermophilus MetRS
A 1.5 kb DNA fragment encoding amino acid residues 1­502 of T. thermophilus MetRS was amplified from the cloned metS gene [27] using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This PCR fragment, which has the TAG termination codon in place of the AAG codon for Lys503 and the Nde I and Sal I sites created at the 5 and 3 ends, respectively, was cloned into the Nde I/Sal I sites of the T7 polymerase expression vector, pK7 [45]. E. coli JM109(DE3) cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmid. The cells were cultured at 37°C in 20 l of medium (pH 7.0) containing 10 g/l Bactotryptone, 5 g/l yeast extract, 5 g/l NaCl, and 50 µg/ml kanamycin. After cultivation for 8 h, isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTE) was added to a concentration of 0.5 mM, and the cultivation was continued overnight. About 200 g of wet cells were harvested using centrifugation. The extract of the harvested cells was incubated at 70°C for 20 min to denature the E. coli proteins. The recombinant T. thermophilus MetRS was purified to near homogeneity by chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column, as described previously [27]. The MetRS fraction from the DEAE-Sephacel chromatography was further applied to a Phenyl Superose column (FPLC, Pharmacia), and the elution was performed, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, with a linear gradient (from 800 to 0 mM) of (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) containing 25 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The MetRS fractions were collected and used for the crystallization. The Lys3Cys (K3C) mutant was prepared using site-directed mutagenesis of the MetRS gene by PCR, followed by the same purification procedures as described previously. The selenomethionylated MetRS was prepared as follows. Cells of an E. coli methionine-auxotroph strain, B834(DE3), were transformed with the monomeric T. thermophilus MetRS construct. The cells were cultured in 5 ml of luria broth medium overnight at 37°C and then were grown in 100 ml of LeMaster medium [46] to an OD600 of 0.7. This culture was used to inoculate 8 l of LeMaster medium. The culture was induced with IPTE at an OD600 of 0.37 and was harvested at an OD600 of 1.0. This growth medium is that described by LeMaster and Richards, supplemented with 30 µg/l selenomethionine, 100 µM CaCl2, 1 µM ZnSO4, vitamin mixture (100 mg/l each of biotin, choline chloride, folic acid, nicotinamide, d-pantothenate, and pyridoxal, and 100 µg/l of riboflavin), and 5 µg/l thiamin. The purification was carried out by the same procedures as those described above, except that all of the buffers were degassed and contained 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid.

Biological implications
Each of the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases strictly recognizes its specific amino acid and tRNA(s). The 10 `class I' aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are thought to have evolved from an ancestral enzyme with the catalytic-domain structure based on the Rossmann fold, which is totally different from that conserved in the 10 `class II' aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Nevertheless, it had not been well established what is conserved and what is diverged in the protein structures of the class I synthetases, with respect to the recognition of their characteristic nucleotide residues located, for example, in the anticodon and the amino-acid-accepting terminus. In order to understand the evolutionary relationships among the class I synthetases, the sequence-based classification into three subclasses, Ia, Ib, and Ic, must be examined at the tertiary-structure level. In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of the `class Ia' methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) from Thermus thermophilus. The T. thermophilus MetRS structure does not agree with the previously reported, probably incorrect, crystal structure of the Escherichia coli MetRS, and is in full agreement with the biochemical and genetic data from E. coli MetRS. The conserved `anticodon-binding' residues are spatially clustered on an -helix-bundle domain. We show that the topology of the MetRS -helix-bundle domain is conserved in the structures of the class Ia isoleucyl- and arginyl-tRNA synthetases. The new domain boundaries of the Rossmann fold domain and the connective peptide (CP) domain characteristically inserted into the Rossmann-fold domain are proposed in this study for the class I synthetases. The region between the Rossmann-fold and the anticodon-binding domains was defined as a domain with a ­­­­ topology (named the SC fold), which was found to be conserved in the class Ia and class Ib synthetases, together with the features of the two short linkers connecting the three domains. The SC-fold domain contains the class I specific KMSKS motif for the enzyme reaction, and furthermore, is likely to dock the inner side of the L-shaped tRNA. These structural features that define class I and/or subclass Ia/Ib of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases will serve as a solid basis for understanding how the primordial Rossmann-fold enzyme evolved by C-terminal acquisition of the SC-fold domain for holding the L-shaped tRNA molecule, and how specific types of RNA-binding domains have evolved for distinguishing distinct anticodons.

Crystallization
Crystals of the monomeric T. thermophilus MetRS were grown at 20°C by vapor diffusion in hanging drops and were enlarged by microseeding. A 10 µl drop containing 15 mg/ml protein buffered with 5% PEG 6000, 1 mM DTT, and 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5 was equilibrated against a reservoir solution containing 25% PEG 6000, 1 mM DTT, and 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5. One crystal harvested after four days was inserted as a seed into a 10 µl hanging drop containing 10 mg/ml protein buffered with 3­5% PEG 6000, 1 mM DTT, and 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. The rod-shaped crystals grew to average dimensions of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.4 mm in about one week. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with unit-cell dimensions of a = 57.15 (3) Å, b = 82.75 (3) Å, and c = 117.42 (4) Å, and contain one molecule in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The measured density, Dobs = 1.22 g/cm3, gives a calculated solvent content of 48.1% and a Vm of 2.39 Å3/Da. Three heavy-atom derivatives were prepared by soaking the native crystals in solutions of 15% PEG6000, 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1.45 mM EtHgSC6H4CO2Na (EMTS), for nine days, 2 mM Sm(OAc)3, for two days, and 10 mM K2PtCl4, for eight days, respectively. Crystals of the site-directed Lys3Cys (K3C) mutant were grown under the same conditions as those for the native crystal. The ethyl mercury chloride (EMC) derivative was prepared by soaking the

Crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted MetRS were also grown by microseeding. A small native crystal was inserted as a seed into a 10 µl drop containing the selenomethionine-substituted MetRS buffered with 5% PEG 6000, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5. A crystal harvested from this drop was again inserted into another drop under the same conditions. The crystals of the selenomethionine-substituted MetRS were enlarged to dimensions of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.3 mm. Native protein crystals were soaked in the solution of 15% PEG 6000, 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.6 mM ATP. The native crystals soaked in the solution containing 0.5 mM methionine were cracked. Co-crystallizations with ATP or methionine were also tried in the protein solution containing 0.5­5 mM ATP or 0.2­0.3 mM methionine under the same conditions as those of the native crystallization.

Model building and refinement
Chain tracing in the solvent-flattened MIR map at 3.0 Å was carried using the graphic program O [50], and the identified positions of nine out of the ten selenomethionine residues became certain starting points in the model building. The model was refined initially using slow torsion in the program X-PLOR [51], followed by a simulated annealing refinement. Two residues at the C-terminal end, from a total of 502 residues, were missing. The final model contains 4098 protein atoms and 136 water molecules. The refined model gave an R factor of 21.0% at 6.0­2.0 Å resolution and an Rfree of 29.1% for 5% of the randomly chosen reflections [52]. All of the non-glycine residues, except Val226, have  and  angles that lie in the energetically allowed region of the Ramachandran diagram.

Data collection and MIR phasing
All data sets, except those for the selenomethionylated crystals, were collected at 10°C using a Weissenberg-type imaging-plate diffractometer installed on beam line BL6A at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The data set of the selenomethionylated crystal was collected at 20°C on an RAXIS-IIc imaging-plate using a Rigaku rotating anode generating Cu K radiation. The intensities were processed with the DENZO and SCALEPACK programs [47]. The crystal structure was determined using multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR). The Patterson map calculation, heavy-atom refinement, solvent flattening (DM), histogram-matching algorithm of DM, and electron-density map calculations were performed using the CCP4 program suite [48]. The Patterson map of the EMTS derivative was interpreted, and the sites of the other three heavy-atom derivatives and the Se atom sites of the selenomethionylated protein were determined using difference Fourier maps phased with the EMTS derivative. Given that the selenomethionylated crystals had excellent isomorphism, the native and selenomethionylated proteins were used mainly to determine the phases. On the other hand, the four heavy-atom derivatives were used for reinforcement, because their isomorphism was poor, caused by soaking with the heavy metal. The MIR phases calculated using the program SHARP [49] gave more meaningful maps in the regions of the loop on the boundary with the solvent, especially the loop containing the KMSKS motif. The phasing statistics are listed in Table 2.
