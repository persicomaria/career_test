ABSTRACT Phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2) is an isozyme of the glycolytic pathway that provides ATP required for sperm motility. It is encoded by an autosomal retrogene that is expressed only during spermatogenesis, concomitant with the inactivation of the X-linked Pgk1 gene. PGK2 from the mouse, Mus musculus, has been overexpressed from a plasmid in bacteria and purified. It was crystallized in three forms: as the apoenzyme, as a complex with 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), and as a complex with 3PG and ATP. The crystal structures ° were solved to 2.7, 2.0, and 2.7 A resolutions, respectively. The overall fold is nearly identical with previously solved mammalian PGK1 molecules. The apoenzyme is in the ``open'' form; that is the N-terminal domain that can bind 3PG and the C-terminal domain that binds ATP are too far apart for the substrates to interact. Binding 3PG causes a 138 rotation that partially closes the structure and causes helix 13, which is disordered in the unliganded structure, to stabilize. Binding ATP leaves the protein in the open configuration but also causes helix 13 to be ordered. Sequence alignment suggests that the active site of PGK2 is essentially identical to that of the cytoplasmic PGK1, but significant differences accumulate on a side of the C-terminal domain away from the active site. These changes may mediate the binding of this isoform to other proteins within the sperm flagellum, while still allowing the hinging action between the domains that is essential to catalytic activity.

INTRODUCTION Mammalian sperm is the product of a complex developmental program that involves the time-dependent expression of germ cellspecific transcripts.1 Some of these code for unique sperm proteins, but many encode isoforms of somatic cell proteins. Notably in this class, sperm contain distinct isozymes that catalyze many of the reactions in the glycolytic pathway. Several of these sperm isozymes, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase S (GAPDHS),2,3 lactate dehydrogenase C (LDHC),4 two aldolase Arelated isozymes (ALDOART1 and ALDOART2), and phosphoglycerate kinase 2 (PGK2),5,6 are encoded by genes with restricted expression in germ cells. Others, including variants of hexokinase 13 and aldolase A (Vemuganti et al., 2007), are the result of alternative splicing during spermatogenesis. Energy production is compartmentalized in the sperm flagellum, with mitochondria confined to the middle piece and glycolytic enzymes organized in the longest tail segment known as the principal piece.7­9 Several glycolytic enzymes are tightly bound to the fibrous sheath, a cytoskeletal structure that defines the limits of the principal piece10­12 GAPDHS and two aldolase A-related isozymes have novel N-terminal extensions that are likely to play a role in anchoring these enzymes to the fibrous sheath.11 Other sperm glycolytic isozymes, including spermatogenic cell-specific hexokinase 1 variants3 and LDHC,13 are also localized in the principal piece, but are not tightly bound to the fibrous sheath.12 Unique structural features of these and other sperm glycolytic isozymes may facilitate the colocalization of the entire pathway within the principal piece, thereby insuring ATP delivery to the distal segments of the flagellum. Novel features may also contribute to distinctive enzymatic properties that have been reported for sperm glycolytic isozymes, including aldolase,14 GAPDHS,15 and LDHC.16

Structure of PGK2

Glycolytic ATP production is essential for the motility of both mouse and human sperm.17­19 When this pathway is disrupted by gene targeting to eliminate the sperm GAPDHS isozyme, male mice are infertile and exhibit very poor sperm motility.18 Oxygen consumption is similar in sperm from Gapdhs2/2 and wild-type mice, suggesting that the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation are not impaired. ATP levels are reduced by 90%, however, confirming the key role of glycolysis in sperm energy production and motility. A recent study identified motility defects in 81% of more than 1000 sperm samples from infertile men.20 This highlights the potential of inhibitors of sperm-specific glycolytic enzymes as male contraceptives. In addition to consideration for human birth control, sperm-specific glycolytic inhibitors could have other uses. Rodents are known carriers of human diseases (plague, hantavirus, encephalitis, etc.), and are estimated to destroy 30% of the world's food supply and billions of dollars in property every year. Contraceptive control of these populations is seen as a promising means of limiting the human and economic costs. This study is part of an effort to examine mouse PGK2 as a potential target for drug design to produce inhibitors with contraceptive potential. In glycolysis, PGK catalyzes the conversion of 1,3bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) and ADP to 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) and ATP, but the reaction is reversed in gluconeogenesis. PGK is a monomeric protein consisting of two domains: an N-terminal domain, which binds 1,3-BPG and 3PG; and a C-terminal domain that contains the ADP/ATP binding site.21 In crystallographic studies of PGK from numerous species, these domains have been observed in an ``open'' conformation, where the binding sites are far apart,21­25 in an intermediate ``partially closed'' conformation,26­29 and in a ``closed'' conformation.30,31 In the closed conformation, the substrates are brought into close proximity, presumably facilitating catalysis.30 Here we report the crystal structures of the Mus musculus PGK2 unliganded apoenzyme and complexes with 3PG and with ATP, determined using molecular replacement with porcine PGK123 as the starting model.

Ligase (New England Biolabs) to create a fusion with GST. The DNA sequence of the recombinant PGK2 (PGK2-pGEX4T3) was confirmed by the DNA Sequencing Facility at the University of Texas at Austin after the plasmid DNA construct was purified using the Qiagen Miniprep Kit (Qiagen).
Overexpression and purification of PGK2

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and plasmids

A plasmid with the gene for mouse PGK2 was provided by Dr. John McCarrey.5 PfuUltra high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used to amplify the gene by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure, followed by restriction digestion with BamHI and EcoRI (New England Biolabs). The plasmid pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences) was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated with the prepared PGK2 gene using T4 DNA

The plasmid PGK2-pGEX4T3 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen), made competent by the RbCl method,32 and plated onto LB-amp plates (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl, 100 mg mL21 ampicillin) with an overnight incubation at 378C. A single transformed colony was grown overnight in 10 mL LB medium with 100 mg mL21 ampicillin at 378C in a rotary shaker. A 5 mL volume of the overnight cell culture was diluted into 500 mL of LB medium with 100 mg mL21 ampicillin in a 2800-mL Fernbach flask and grown at 378C. The cells were induced with 1 mM IPTG when the OD600 reached 0.7 and incubated at 308C for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 10 min at 48C and the cell pellets stored at 2208C. All the purification steps were carried out on ice or at 48C. Frozen cell pellets from 1 L of culture medium were suspended in 25 mL of cold lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl) and broken in a French pressure cell (6.895 3 106 Pa). The debris was removed by centrifugation (17,000g) for 30 min at 48C followed by ultracentrifugation (100,000g) for 1 h at 48C to pellet the remaining insoluble material. The supernatant was filtered (0.2 lm) and bound to a 5-mL glutathione­agarose (Sigma) column that was washed with 100 mL lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, followed by a wash with 1-L lysis buffer without detergent at a rate of 0.3 mL min21. The washed glutathione­agarose was transferred to a sterile 15-mL conical tube, followed by the addition of 1/ 10th volume 103 thrombin cleavage buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 25 mM CaCl2) and a total of 50 U thrombin protease (Sigma, T-1063). The tube was attached to a rotisserie shaker to slowly mix the suspension overnight at 48C. After 4 days the thrombin protease cleaved 50% of the fusion protein with no obvious proteolytic activity on PGK2. The glutathione­agarose slurry was transferred to a 25-mL column where the cleaved PGK2 was removed by gravity drip with 3-mL lysis buffer wash at 0.6 mL min21. The 50 mL volume of cleaved PGK2 was concentrated to 14.3 mg mL21 by use of an Amicon (Millipore) 10,000 MWCO membrane, then stored at 2708C.
Crystallization and data collection

Crystallization screenings of the PGK2-3PG complex were also carried out by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, using equal volumes (1 lL) mouse PGK2 (14 mg mL21, in HEPES, pH 7.0) with 10 mM D-3-phosphoglycerate, disodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich), and solutions (1 lL) from the Grid Screen PEG 6000 kit (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA). Small rectangular (0.05 mm 3 0.05 mm 3 0.1 mm) crystals appeared after 6 days in the 30% PEG 6000 at pH 7.0 and 8.0. Larger crystals, 0.2 mm 3 0.3 mm, were harvested after 60 days. Crystals from a mixture of 14 mg mL21 protein with 10 mM 3PG and 5 mM ATP were grown from 30% PEG6000, pH 9.0, using the hanging drop method at room temperature. Prior to data collection, crystals of the unliganded PGK2 were treated with cryoprotectant by transferring them to 10% PEG 400 for 5­10 s. Additional cryoprotection was not required to freeze the complex crystals. Crystals, mounted in a cryoloop (Hampton Research), were frozen by dipping in liquid nitrogen and placed in the cold stream on the goniostat. Crystal diffraction data were collected at 100 K on an RAXIS IV11 image plate detector (Rigaku/MSC, The Woodlands, TX) with X-rays generated by a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode generator (Rigaku/MSC) operated at 50 mV, 100 mA. Diffraction images were processed and data reduced using HKL2000.33
Molecular replacement

replacement solution for a dimer in the asymmetric unit of the PGK2/3PG/ATP crystal was also determined using MOLREP.
Structure determination and analysis

Model building was done on a Gateway Select SB computer (Poway, CA) using O.37 Each of the molecular replacement solutions was threaded with the mouse (strain C3H/He) PGK2 sequence.6 Refinement of models was performed with the crystallography and NMR system (CNS) (Version 1.1) using the slow-cooling protocol.38 There were several rounds of refinement followed by rebuilding of the model. To facilitate manual rebuilding of the model, a difference map and a 2Fo-Fc map, SIGMAA-weighted to eliminate bias from the model,39 were prepared. Five percent of the diffraction data were set aside throughout refinement for crossvalidation.40 PROCHECK41 was used to determine areas of poor geometry. For the purpose of locating bound solvent molecules, CNS was used to select peaks of height 3.5 standard deviations above the mean from a difference ° map to eliminate those peaks that were not within 3.5 A of a protein nitrogen or oxygen atom. O was used to manually view and accept water sites. Computations were done on an HP Pavilion a510n computer (HewlettPackard, Palo Alto, CA). Superpositions of protein molecules were done with O. Model pictures were made using BOBSCRIPT,42,43 Raster3D,44 and PYMOL (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA).
Atomic coordinates

Crystal cell parameters indicated that the asymmetric unit of the apoenzyme likely contained two PGK2 molecules. The structure of the PGK2 crystal dimer was solved by molecular replacement using N-terminal (residues 1­186) and C-terminal (residues 205­394) domains of pig muscle PGK1 (PDB accession code 1VJD),23 which has 95% sequence homology, as search models with the EPMR (Evolutionary Protein Molecular Replacement) program.34 The sequential placement within the asymmetric unit of the two domains of each molecule resulted in a model with a correlation coefficient of 0.58 and an R-factor of 0.51. Examination of a 2Fo-Fc map generated using this model showed good electron density for only three of the four domains within the asymmetric unit with poor density for the N-terminal domain of the second molecule. A subsequent run of EPMR using the N-terminal domain as the search model and using the other domains as a static model resulted in an improved placement of the second N-terminal domain, with a correlation coefficient of 0.71 and an R-factor of 0.375. MOLREP,35 from the CCP4 suite,36 was used to determine the molecular replacement solution for the PGK2/3PG crystal (one molecule per asymmetric unit), using the porcine PGK1 as a model. The molecular

Coordinates of the refined models of the mouse unliganded PGK2 dimer, PGK2/3PG, and the dimer of PGK2/3PG and PGK2/ATP have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with entry codes 2P9Q, 2P9T, and 2PAA, respectively.

Figure 2(a) shows a ribbon tracing of the PGK2 protein with 3PG and ATP bound and labels for secondary structural elements mentioned in the discussion. As with other PGKs, the molecule has two clearly defined domains. The N-terminal 186 residues are linked by helix 722 (residues 187­202) to a 215 residue C-terminal domain; the active site lies in the large cleft between these domains. The relative orientation of the two domains differs slightly between the two monomers of the heterodimer found in the asymmetric unit, but both are clearly in the open conformation, similar to that first observed with the structure of unliganded PGK1 from horse muscle.22 Also similar to the horse unliganded structure,26 helix 13 (residues 372­383 in mouse PGK2) is disordered. The fold of PGK2 is virtually identical to that of PGK1; the rms distance between equivalent a-carbon atoms of unliganded PGK2 and porcine PGK1 in the open conforma° tion is 0.9 A. Our models were built using the amino acid sequence for the PGK2 isozyme encoded by the b allele, as reported by Boer et al.6 for the C3H/He strain of Mus musculus.6 This sequence differs by one residue (Arg versus Gln at residue 150) from PGK2 encoded by the a allele present in the BALB/c strain,6 which is deposited in the Swiss-Prot database (entry PGK2_MOUSE). Both the sequencing of our plasmid and examination of the electron density for our three crystal structures confirm that our PGK2 was encoded by the b allele, containing an Arg at residue 150.

The mixture of protein, 3PG, and ATP crystallized with a heterodimer of PGK2/3PG and PGK2/ATP complexes in the asymmetric unit. The crystals are of space group P1 with cell constants a 5 39.9, b 5 64.5, c 5 ° 75.9 A, a 5 90.38, b 5 77.28, g 5 85.08. The Vm is 2.1 ° 3/Da. Residues 372­386 are disordered in the monomer A bound with 3PG, similar to the unliganded PGK2 structure; however, these residues are clearly ordered, forming a helix, in the monomer with ATP bound. The refined model includes 28 solvent molecules. A sample of the electron density map is shown in Figure 1(c). Crystallographic data for the unliganded PGK2 and the complex crystals are summarized in Table I.

Our work produced two models for PGK2 bound to 3PG. One complex resulted from cocrystallization of just these two components giving one complex per asymmetric unit. The other arose by cocrystallizing these together with ATP; those crystals had two complexes per asymmetric unit, one bound only to 3PG and one bound only to ATP. The PGK2/3PG complexes from these sources will be described in turn. In the crystal form containing only the PGK2/3PG complex, the protein is observed to be in the partially closed conformation. That is, we observe a rotation of 138 of the N-terminal domain relative to the C-terminal domain when compared with the unliganded, open structure. Helix 13 is ordered in this PGK2/3PG structure. Previously, the structure of pig muscle PGK1 bound with 3PG was found in the partially closed conformation, characterized by a 88 rotation of the N-terminal domain, and with an ordered helix 13.26,28,29 In PGK2, the 3PG phosphate group is bound in a specific subsite.

velope it. The alcohol oxygen of 3PG hydrogen-bonds with the side chains of conserved residues Asp 23 and Asn 25, while the carboxylate forms an ion pair with the invariant Arg 38. Although 3PG is much smaller than ATP, its pocket binds it 10 times more tightly than the much larger adenine nucleotides are bound in their pocket.46 Lys 215 is known to be a key catalytic residue in the PGK mechanism46; it is far removed from the catalytic site in both the open and partially closed conformations. The position of these residues is illustrated in Figure 3(a). In the heterodimeric structure of PGK2/3PG and PGK2/ATP, the PGK2/3PG complex remains in the open conformation with helix 13 disordered. High temperature factors for the 3PG atoms and weaker ligand electron density indicate that the ligand may only be partially occupied. With temperature factors for 3PG fixed at 25.0 ° A2, the refined occupancy of the ligand is 0.65. The binding of 3PG appears to be nonproductive in the heterodimeric structure. Although the phosphate moiety of 3PG is bound to the protein as observed previously, the alcohol and carboxylate groups of the molecule are rotated such that they have none of the interactions with the protein observed in productive binding. An open confor-

mation and nonproductive binding of 3PG was also observed with the yeast PGK structure.21
Structure of PGK2 bound with ATP

ATP is bound to the C-terminal domain of PGK2 as shown in Figure 2(a). The protein is observed to be in the open conformation, as was true for the other asymmetric unit which bound only 3PG in the unproductive mode. However, in the PGK2-ATP complex, helix 13 is ordered. This is similar to the structure of pig muscle PGK1 bound with ATP which was found in the open conformation and with an ordered helix 13.23 In PGK2, the N6 atom of the adenine ring forms a hydrogen-bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of residue 312. Ribose oxygens O20 and O30 can form hydrogen bonds with the conserved Glu 343 side chain. The first and second phosphates are stabilized by interactions with the NZ atom of conserved Lys 219. The gphosphate is aligned with the amino terminus of helix 13, interacting electrostatically with the helix dipole; in particular the phosphate hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogen of residue 374, probably contributing to the ordering of helix 13. This interaction is shown in Fig-

Transition between PGK conformations

PGK is a typical two-domain hinge-bending enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1,3-BPG and ADP to

3PG and ATP.47 The N-terminal domain binds 1,3-BPG and 3PG; and the C-terminal domain contains the ADP/ ATP binding site.21 The substrates are able to bind to the protein in the open conformation. However, the protein must be brought into the closed conformation in order for the substrates to be in position for the catalytic transfer of a phosphate moiety. Presumably, the protein

must then return to the open conformation to facilitate product release.30 Our work shows the unliganded mouse PGK2 has a disordered helix 13 and the two domains are in the open conformation. This is identical to what was seen with the horse PGK1 apo-protein structure.22,26 Binding 3PG to the N-terminal domain of mouse PGK2 causes an ordering of helix 13 and a 138 rotation of the N-terminal domain, relative to the C-terminal domain [Fig. 2(b)]. A similar 88 rotation was seen with 3PG bound to pig PGK1 when compared with the horse apo-PGK1 and in subsequent structures of pig PGK1 bound with 3PG.26,28,29 With the binding of 3PG to PGK2, the side chain of conserved R38 undergoes a conformational ° change, moving 2.1 A to form an ion pair with the carboxylate group of the ligand. The substrate binding causes the ordering of helix 13 although there is no direct contact between the ligand and helix 13. However as shown in Figure 3(a), the repositioned R38 forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond interaction with the carbonyl oxygen of residue 372 at the amino-terminal end of helix 13. The rotation of the N-terminal domain to the partially closed form puts the side chain of N35, at the aminoterminal end of helix 1, in position to form a watermediated hydrogen bond with residue 385. The domain rotation is further stabilized by newly formed hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between helix 1 and helix 14 (residues 395­401). In PGK2, the NE atom of Arg 38 is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of residue 393. It has been shown that catalysis is reduced nearly 2000-fold when R38 is mutated to Ala or Gln,46,48,49 but reduced less than twofold when mutated to Lys.46 R38 plays a key role in holding the carboxyl group of 3PG and 1-phosphate group of 13-BPG in position for catalysis. It may play an additional role in initiating the ordering of helix 13 and the transition of the two domain protein to the partially closed conformation. In our third PGK2 crystal structure, which shows 3PG bound in a nonproductive orientation, R38 does not form hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of the bound 3PG and remains in the conformation observed in the apo-PGK2 structure. In this same structure, helix 13 remains disordered, and the protein is in the open conformation. During catalysis it is clear that the domains of PGK must fully close, but this may be a very unstable conformation. Crystal structures of T. brucei and T. maritima PGK bound with both 3PG and ADP have been solved in the closed conformation.30,31 The transition from the partially closed to the closed conformation requires an additional 258 rotation of the N-terminal domain relative to the C-terminal domain [Fig. 2(c)], bringing helix 14 roughly parallel to helix 8. In these structures, it is the b-phosphate of ADP that interacts with helix 13 rather than the g-phosphate seen with ATP. It is not entirely

clear from these structures what chemical interactions trigger or stabilize the closed conformation. It is known that 1,3-BPG binds human PGK1 1000 times more tightly than 3PG46 and may play a major, but as yet not understood, role in the transition to the closed conformation. Because of the highly unstable nature of 1,3BPG, no one has been able to crystallize PGK with bound substrates of the forward glycolytic reaction. We attempted to cocrystallize the protein with 3PG and ATP, anticipating that we might force the protein into the closed conformation for the back reaction. Instead, the crystals that formed contained two PGK2 molecules in the asymmetric unit, one with just 3PG bound in a nonproductive mode (described earlier) and the other with just ATP bound. With ATP bound, helix 13 and surrounding residues have been stabilized. The gphosphate of ATP interacts with the helix dipole and forms a hydrogen bond with the peptide nitrogen of residue 375, contributing to the stabilization of helix 13. The helix is further stabilized by interactions with helix 14 and strand J. The a- and b-phosphates are stabilized by a charge interaction with the NZ atom of conserved lysine 219 of helix 8. The b-phosphate is also bound by a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of residue 212 on the carboxyl terminal of strand G. The two domains are in the open conformation, as observed with pig PGK1 bound by ATP.23 As a result, the binding of ATP has shed little light on the driving force for domain closing. In the partially closed conformation of PGK2/3PG, the conserved hydrophobic side chains of Leu 222 and Met 226 of helix 8 interact loosely with conserved leucines 399 and 402, respectively, of helix 14. In the closed conformation T. brucei PGK ternary complex, helix 14 is rotated relative to helix 8 making for better van der Waals contacts between the hydrophobic residues of helices 8 and 14, and introducing ion pairs between Asp 222 and Arg 65 (corresponding PGK2 residues D218 and R65) and between Lys 219 (PGK2 residue K215) and 3PG. The conserved K215 has been shown to be required for catalysis with human PGK1.46 This transition of bringing helix 8 into close proximity of the 3PG binding site may be accommodated, perhaps triggered, by a swapping of binding sites for the b-phosphate from a strand G/helix 8 site to the helix 13 site. However, this partially closed structure is much closer to the open form than the closed form, and still leaves open the question of how the closed catalytic conformation is triggered.
Comparison of PGK2 with PGK1

A key question for this study is, what are the differences between the PGK1 and the sperm-specific PGK2? Why does the organism need two isoforms of this enzyme? Figure 4 shows an amino acid sequence alignment of PGK1 and PGK2 from three mammalian species,

mouse, pig, and human. Table II shows a pairwise comparison among these six enzymes. It shows that PGK1 enzymes are about 97% identical in sequence, and that PGK1 is about 85% identical to its PGK2 paralog. The PGK2 isozymes are less similar to each other, about 85%, than are the PGK1 isozymes. PGK1 and PGK2 from mouse are 84% identical, differing at 66 of 416 residues. Many of these changes are chemically trivial, like alteration of Ile to Leu, but others are more substantial. Figure 5 shows the Ca trace of mouse PGK2; the backbone position of the 30 changes deemed chemically significant by the alignment program EMBOSS55 are indicated. Examples are conversion of Phe to His at position 48, conversion of Glu to Phe at position 232, and conversion of Ile to Lys at 322. Note that no significant changes are found among the substrate binding residues, or indeed within the active site area. The majority of the changes are seen clustered in the C-terminal domain. In particular, helices 11 and 10b and two nearby loop regions show a high concentration of significant changes. Indeed, the only PGK1/PGK2 conversions conserved in mouse, pig, and human are found in helix 11 and strand J; these are indicated in Figure 4. The active sites of PGK2 and PGK1 are essentially identical, consistent with similar catalytic properties reported for the mouse PGK1, PGK2a and PGK2b isoforms.56,57 The structure suggests that the PGK2 isozyme has probably not evolved any modified catalytic activity. More likely, the changes between the isoforms may enhance PGK2 stability58 or facilitate protein interactions important for localization of PGK2 in the sperm flagellum. It is interesting to note that the changes accumulate on the ``bottom'' of the C-terminal domain (see Fig. 5) and if those positions do anchor the enzyme, to the membrane or to other protein components, the hinge action required to close the structure during catalysis would still be unhindered. However, in speculating about subcellular localization, it should be pointed out that the sequence differences do not point to any clear mechanism for surface recognition. That is, the changes do not generate a surface ``patch'' with a distinct chemical character, like a cluster of hydrophobic or cationic side chains. The changes seem to be chemically random.

pig and human show that the same general regions (helices 10b and 11) of the proteins are altered in the spermspecific protein, but, again, no clear chemical pattern can be discerned to suggest the effect of the changes. One goal in analyzing the sperm-specific PGK2 isoform was to assess the likelihood that one might select for, or design, sperm-specific inhibitors that could function as contraceptive agents. The active site similarity to PGK1 suggests that active site inhibitors, such as competitive inhibitors to ATP or 3PG, are unlikely to be specific to the sperm isozyme. It may be possible to identify targets based on the binding of PGK2 to sperm flagellar constituents, but at this time there is insufficient information about this process to make this site useful for rational design or virtual screening methods.59­61 REFERENCES
