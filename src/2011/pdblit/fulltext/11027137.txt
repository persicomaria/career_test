Modified nucleosides in the anticodon domain of Escherichia coli tRNALys are necessary for high-affinity codon recognition and reading frame maintenance. Human tRNALys,3 is the specific primer for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and also requires nucleoside modification for proper function. We now present NMR solution structures for the fully modified 17-nucleotide E. coli tRNALys anticodon stemloop domain (ASL). NMR data were also collected for several partially modified ASLs, revealing the contributions each modified nucleoside (mnm5s2U34, t6A37, and 39) makes in transforming the disordered, unmodified tRNA ASL into the highly ordered native structure. The solution structure of the native ASL domain provides insight into longstanding questions regarding both wobble position modification and the nearly ubiquitous t6A37 found in tRNAs with an adjacent U at position 36. Native tRNALys has a U-turn structure similar to the yeast tRNAPhe crystal structure, unlike previously proposed "unconventional" anticodon structures characterized by stable interactions between mnm5s2U-34 and t6A-37.
ABSTRACT:

Human tRNALys,3 and the single tRNALys isoacceptor in Escherichia coli both have the anticodon sequence U34U35U36, and the anticodon domains are highly functionalized with hypermodified nucleosides at positions 34 and 37 (Figure 1). The requirement for hypermodification is underscored by results that show that the unmodified anticodon is relatively unstructured (1) and that nucleoside modification is necessary for mRNA-dependent ribosome binding (2, 3). The tRNA anticodon is a specific recognition element for lysyl tRNA synthetase, with the anticodon nucleoside modifications providing a 140-fold increase in binding affinity over an unmodified tRNA transcript (4). Similarly, in the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)1 transcription initiation complex, there is a modification-dependent interaction between the anticodon of tRNALys,3 and the HIV genomic RNA (5, 6), and there is also an interaction between the tRNALys,3 anticodon and reverse transcriptase (RT) (79). Biochemical studies have implicated the hypermodified

The upper stem sequence of human tRNALys,3 was used to facilitate subsequent comparisons between the human and the E. coli isoacceptors. The two tRNAs have the same sequence for the last two base-pairs and the loop, the "extended anticodon". Human tRNALys,3 has mcm5s2U34, ms2t6A37, and 39 modifications in the anticodon domain. In the text, native tRNALys refers to the fully modified ASL with mnm5s2U34, t6A37, and 39. Doubly modified ASLs contain either U34 or A37.

The very similar modifications in human tRNALys,3 and E. coli tRNALys suggest that E. coli tRNALys will also be a good structural model for the anticodon of human tRNALys,3, and the E. coli tRNALys structure should give insights into the effects nucleoside modifications have on tRNA interactions with HIV-1 genomic RNA and with HIV-1 RT.

12576 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 41, 2000 tRNALys exhibits high frameshifting frequencies at A-AAA-AAG mRNA sites where the A-site tRNA initially has the wobble position nucleotide paired with G and then slips 1 nucleotide in the 5 direction to pair with an evidently more stable AAA codon (12, 13). In the example from the dnaX gene with tandem lysine codons, the P-site tRNA appears to simultaneously move in the 5 direction along with the A-site tRNA where the 5 A allows for two AAA codons in the -1 frame. The "shiftiness" of tRNALys in the A-site is also seen with other codons in the P-site, as seen for the Bacillus subtilis cytidine deaminase gene frameshift site (CGA-AAG), where a -1 frameshift of A-site tRNALys occurs with tRNAArg in the P-site (14). Hagervall and coworkers have investigated lysine tRNA facilitated frameshifting in modification deficient E. coli mutants to delineate the effects individual functional groups of the 5-methylaminomethyl,2-thiouridine (mnm5s2U) nucleoside have on frameshifting. While the frameshifting frequencies are sensitive to the modification status of the wobble nucleoside, no conclusive model was apparent from their results (15). Wobble modification in tRNALys also affects in-frame codon-anticodon recognition as shown by the misreading of asparagine codons (AAU/C) by tRNALys during asparagine starvation (16). Unconventional structures have been proposed to explain the unusual functional properties of tRNALys (17, 18), and NMR studies of a pentamer model for the anticodon led to a proposed structure in which the key feature was a direct interaction between mnm5s2U34 and t6A (18). The 17nucleotide tRNALys ASL in Figure 1 is structurally restrained as compared to the pentamer model studied previously, and the hairpin restraint may prevent non-native interactions between the highly functionalized modified nucleosides. tRNA ASLs have been shown to be functionally competent in mRNA dependent ribosome binding (2, 3, 19) and represent a minimal system for structure determination of the anticodon domain. We had previously determined the structure of the unmodified tRNALys ASL and the ASL with a single pseudouridine () modification (1). These structures were quite dynamic and allowed for a noncanonical A+-C interaction at the base of the stem. The major questions of the current study were whether the introduction of the hypermodified nucleosides would significantly restrict the conformational flexibility of the 7-nucleotide anticodon loop, whether the native ASL adopts a structure similar to other well-characterized tRNAs, and whether there are direct contacts between the hypermodified nucleosides. Resolving these issues is critical for understanding the unique properties of tRNALys and for understanding structure-function properties of these hypermodified nucleosides in other tRNA isoacceptors. MATERIALS AND METHODS RNA Synthesis and Purification. RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized on a 1-µmol scale using PAC phophoramidites (Glen Research). The modified phosphoramidites were synthesized and incorporated into the tRNALys ASLs as we have described (20). The normal I2/H2O oxidation solution was used until the mnm5s2U nucleoside was added, and 2 × 5 min oxidation cycles with 10% tBuOOH in acetonitrile were used subsequently. The RNA was deprotected using a multistep protocol specifically optimized for

Sundaram et al. the functional groups on the hypermodified nucleosides. The column bound material was treated with 10% tert-butylamine in dry pyridine, and the support material was then dried to remove acrylonitrile. The RNA was then cleaved from the column, and the base protecting groups were removed with NH4OH/ethanol (3:1, v/v). The solution was lyophilized and then subjected to a two-step fluoride treatment with neat Et3N,3HF followed by tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran (21, 22). Two different fluoride reagents were required to cleanly remove the trimethylsilylethyl group used to protect the t6A carboxylate and to remove the tertbutyldimethylsilyl groups on the sugars and the t6A secondary hydroxyl. The tetrabutylammonium fluoride solution was dried to a viscous gum and redissolved in water, and the solution was passed through an NAP-25 (Pharmacia) column to remove the excess tetrabutylammonium ions. The RNA was then purified by anion exchange HPLC using a Resource Q (Pharmacia) column (23). Mass Spectrometry. The compositions of the crude RNAs and the final, purified RNAs were determined by molecular weight measurements using MALDI-MS as described (20). The presence of specific modified nucleosides was determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/ MS) (24) using a HP 1090 liquid chromatograph interfaced to a Fisons Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Manchester, UK) using electrospray ionization. Nucleoside samples for LC/MS were prepared by digesting approximately 50 µg each of the native tRNA, oxidized native tRNA, and the native tRNA ASL to mononucleosides using nuclease P1, phosphodiesterase I, and then alkaline phosphatase (25). CD Spectroscopy and UV Spectroscopy. CD spectroscopy was done on 1.5-3.0 µM RNA samples in the NMR buffer using a JASCO 720 spectrometer with 1-cm temperature regulated CD cells. The RNA concentrations were determined by UV absorption assuming an extinction coefficient of 1.73 × 105 L mol-1 cm-1. Ellipticities are reported per mole of RNA oligonucleotide. The full-length, native E. coli tRNALys (Sigma) was selectively oxidized using 10% tBuOOH in acetonitrile while monitoring the change in ellipticity at 330 nm (60 min). UV absorbance vs temperature (Tm) measurements were done on an HP 8452A spectrophotometer; the temperature was increased in 1 °C increments with a 1-min equilibration time. Melting experiment samples contained 10 µM RNA dissolved in NMR buffer. Measurements were repeated four times for each hairpin, and the Tm and thermodynamic parameters were calculated with the Melt Fit II program assuming a two-state transition (26). NMR Data Acquisition and Analysis. RNA samples were dissolved in 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 containing 50 mM KCl, 50 mM NaCl, and either 0 or 10 mM MgCl2 to final RNA concentrations of 1.5 mM. NMR data was collected on Varian Unity 500 and Varian INOVA 600 NMR spectrometers using Nalorac probes. The fully modified and partially modified hairpins were monomers at NMR concentrations as determined by measuring their translational diffusion rates (27) and by measuring Tm's over a 100-fold concentration range from 2 to 200 µM. The NMR spectra were assigned using 2D NOESY (28) and TOCSY (29) NMR experiments following the basic sequential assignment strategy established for RNA (30). Complete assignments were made for all nonexchangeable protons, except that stereospecific assignments were not made for the H5/H5

tRNALys Anticodon Structure protons. The imino protons were assigned from 2D NOESY spectra at 10 °C in 90% H2O buffer using a NOESY pulse sequence with a flip-back WATERGATE element (31). The 31 P spectra were assigned using a combination of 2D heteronuclear COSY (32) and 2D hetero-TOCSY-TOCSY (33) experiments. DQCOSY (34) was used for sugar coupling constant measurements. Data were processed and analyzed with VNMR (Varian) and Felix (MSI) software. Unambiguous assignments were facilitated by comparing the 2D NOESY spectra for the native tRNALys ASL and three different doubly modified tRNALys ASLs: tRNALys-mnm5s2U34, 39; tRNALys-t6A37, 39; and tRNALys-s2U34, 39 (Supporting Information). Restraint Determination. Distance restraints were determined from 2D NOESY data in water and in D2O collected with a 180 ms mixing time. An upper bound was determined for a small number of proton pairs based on NOEs observed in 400 ms NOESY spectra. Restraints were only included from the 400 ms data in cases where spin diffusion could clearly be ruled out. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) volumes were converted to distances by scaling to the H5H6 cross-peaks of uridine and cytidine. The sugars were restrained to the 3-endo conformation in cases where there was no detectable H1-H2 DQCOSY or TOCSY cross-peak. Residues 33-36 all had some percentage of 2-endo character based on the correlation experiments, and the sugars were left unrestrained. The backbone R and angles were restrained based on the 31P chemical shifts according to the method of Moore and co-workers (35). This method essentially restrains phosphates with chemical shifts in the A-form range to A-RNA geometries and leaves phosphates with anomalous shifts unrestrained. The nucleosides with "unusual" phosphates were given additional conformational freedom during the refinement by also using loose backbone restraints for their 5 and 3 neighbors, and the remaining loop residues were given a wider range within the allowed conformations than the stem residues. The five stem base pairs were maintained using hydrogenbonding restraints set to 1.8 ( 0.2 Å for the central base pairs and 2.1 ( 0.3 Å for the weaker base pairs at the ends of the stem. Restraints for the A-U base pairs also included adenosine H2 to uridine O2 restraints to maintain base pair planarity. Dihedral angles for the stem residues were restrained to literature A-RNA values ( 30° (R, , , , ). Ribose sugar dihedrals for stem residues and the 100% 3endo loop residues were set to A-RNA values ( 20°. Ribose dihedral angles for loop residues that were not 100% 3endo (residues 33-36) were not restrained. Except for special cases discussed below, loop residue dihedral angles (R, , , , ) were allowed to encompass A- and B-form values ( 30°. To accommodate the downfield shifted phosphate assigned to 33p34, the R and angles for 34 were not restrained. The R and angles were also left unrestrained for mnm5s2U34 and 39 because strong P-H4 cross-peaks for these residues were seen in the 1H-31P heteronuclear COSY spectrum. All dihedral angles were restrained to the anti range ( 90°. Structure Determination. Structure calculations were performed using the general strategy we described previously (1) and detailed below (Table 1). Molecular dynamics calculations were done with the NMR Refine module of the Insight/Discover program (MSI) and the AMBER force field

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 41, 2000 12577 (36). The initial phase of the restrained molecular dynamics simulations included 3.5 ps of restrained dynamics at 1200 K with initial force constants scaled by 0.01 (distance) and 0.05 (dihedral). In the final 2 ps of this 1200 K period, the scale factor was increased in two steps to final values of 0.04 (distance) and 0.2 (dihedral). A subsequent 3 ps of dynamics at 1200 K started with relaxation of the scale factor to 0.01 (distance) and 0.025 (dihedral) for 1 ps and then a two-step increase as before to final values of 1.0 (distance) and 0.1 (dihedral). After this 1200 K equilibration run, the temperature was first cooled to 850 K and then to 100 K in 5 × 1 ps steps with scale factors of 0.75 (distance) and 0.05 (dihedral). The final step of the refinement involved conjugate gradient energy minimization until a maximum derivative of less than 0.05 was obtained. The scale factors were set to 0.015 (distance) and 0.005 (dihedral) during the energy minimization. To avoid having the base pairs fall apart and to prevent the loop from expanding during the weakly restrained minimization, the force constants for the base pair restraints were increased, and the U33 N3H and U36 O1P atoms were fixed. RESULTS CD spectroscopy of NatiVe tRNALys and NatiVe tRNALys ASL. Sulfur-modified uridine nucleosides have a long wavelength UV absorption with a maximum near 330 nm, and this contributes a band in the CD spectrum that is sensitive to local RNA structure (17, 37-39). The sign and intensity of the sulfur CD band can be used to monitor structural stability and even to probe base pairing interactions. CD spectroscopy was used to provide a qualitative measurement of the secondary structure of the tRNALys ASLs and to compare the synthetic ASLs with full-length, native E. coli tRNALys. The CD spectra in the region of the UV absorbance maximum displayed typical A-RNA like behavior (not shown) with the major band near 260 nm decreasing in intensity with increasing temperature. The long wavelength region of the CD spectra of our native tRNALys ASL is shown in Figure 2, trace c. The negative ellipticity with a maximum at 338 nm is typical of thiolated uridines in single-stranded structural environments (17). This indicates that the mnm5s2U nucleoside does not form a stable base-pairing type interaction with other nucleosides in the tRNA anticodon. The negative ellipticity for the ASL is in contrast to the positive band for the full-length native tRNA in Figure 2, trace a. The CD spectrum in Figure 2, trace a is very similar to that reported previously and was given as evidence for a stable interaction involving mnm5s2U (17). However, E. coli tRNALys contains 4-thiouridine (s4U) at position 8 in addition to mnm5s2U34. The positive CD band at 330 nm is very characteristic of the s4U8 nucleoside in tRNA (37), which forms the highly conserved reversed-Hoogsteen tertiary base pair with A14 (40, 41). Since the tRNALys CD spectrum contained contributions from both s4U8 and mnm5s2U34, we selectively oxidized the s4U in full-length tRNALys and obtained the CD spectrum shown in Figure 2, trace b where the only contribution to the long wavelength ellipticity is from mnm5s2U. The nucleoside compositions of each tRNA sample in Figure 2 were verified by enzymatically digesting the tRNAs and the ASL to mononucleosides and then analyzing the nucleoside mixtures by LC/MS (24). The presence of s4U, mnm5s2U, and t6A was confirmed for the

The negative ellipticity due to mnm5s2U34 in trace b is no longer masked by the more intense contribution from s4U8 in trace a. The CD spectra indicate that the ASL structure is similar to the native tRNA and to E. coli tRNAGlu which does not have t6A or s4U8 (17).

commercial E. coli tRNALys, while the selectively oxidized tRNA was missing s4U. The composition of the native tRNALysASL was confirmed by LC/MS analysis of the digested oligonucleotide and by MALDI-MS of the intact RNA (20). Exchangeable Proton Spectra. Imino spectra at 10 °C of the native tRNALys and the doubly modified tRNALysmnm5s2U34,39 and tRNALys-t6A37,39 hairpins are shown in Figure 3. The tRNALys-mnm5s2U34,39 hairpin (Figure 3, trace c) has the simplest NMR spectrum since the wobble modification contributes no additional resonances to the downfield region. Peaks are seen for the three central Watson-Crick base pairs and for the A31-39 interaction at the base of the stem. Pseudouridine stabilizes the Tm by nearly 5 °C, and this stabilization of the 31-39 base pair is required to slow the imino exchange sufficiently to observe an N3-H resonance. We have not been able to detect an imino proton resonance for the A31-U39 interaction in tRNALys ASLs with unmodified U39. In addition to the 39N3-H proton hydrogen bonded to A31, the 39N1-H proton coordinated to a stable water molecule is seen at 10.7 ppm. The native tRNALys imino spectrum (Figure 3, trace a) contains several additional peaks as a result of t6A37. The amide proton resonances at 9.0 and 10.2 ppm were assigned from 2D NOESY and TOCSY connectivities. The NH11 resonance has TOCSY connectivity to the HR and H resonances of the side chain as well as NOE connectivity to side chain protons as discussed below. The sharp resonance at 8.6 ppm is the t6A H2 proton. Another additional weak imino resonance is seen at 11.3 ppm in the native tRNALys spectrum and a similar resonance at 11.5 ppm in the tRNALyst6A37,39 spectrum is seen in Figure 3, trace b. This peak is due to the U33 N3-H imino proton hydrogen bonded to the phosphate between U35 and U36. The support for this assignment is indirect but seems compelling. First, there are a limited number of possible residues that could contribute an imino resonance at this position, namely, the loop uridines.

FIGURE 3: (a) Imino spectra for the native tRNALys ASL, 10 °C. The 1H NMR spectrum of the exchangeable imino protons indicate stable hydrogen bonding interactions for the three central WatsonCrick base pairs and for the A31-39 interaction at the base of the stem. NMR resonances are seen for 39 N3-H and the characteristic N1-H proton hydrogen-bonded through a water molecule to the phosphates of A38 and 39. The two peaks for the amide protons of t6A are upfield of the  N1-H resonance. A weak resonance is seen at 11.3 ppm, which is assigned to the U33 imino proton. (b) Imino spectra for the tRNALys-t6A37, 39 ASL, 10 °C. (c) Imino spectra for the tRNALys-mnm5s2U34, 39 ASL, 10 °C.

The chemical shift is characteristic of a uridine hydrogen bonded to a phosphate (42) and is nearly identical to that seen for an ASL of yeast tRNAPhe (43). We have also seen a similar, though more stable resonance for a tRNALeu ASL hairpin and unambiguously assigned this resonance by specific 15N labeling (unpublished). Phosphorus NMR. The 31P NMR spectrum of the native tRNALys ASL has a single phosphorus resonance shifted significantly downfield of the envelope of resonances (20). This resonance was assigned to the 33p34 phosphate using 2D 1H-31P COSY and 1H-31P hetero-TOCSY-TOCSY experiments. The significant shift in the 31P NMR spectrum indicates either the R or angle is trans, consistent with a -turn geometry in the tRNA ASL (44, 45). We also observed a downfield shifted 33p34 phosphorus resonance (Supporting Information) for tRNALys-mnm5s2U34,39, indicating the backbone angle is also trans in the doubly modified ASL. In contrast, we saw no such NMR resonance for tRNALys-s2U34,39 or tRNALys-t6A37,39 indicating that

for these ASLs the backbone is either unrestricted or adopts a standard A-RNA conformation. The downfield shifted 31P resonances move further downfield when the magnesium concentration is increased and when the temperature is decreased, indicating that the U-turn is stabilized at low temperature and by Mg2+. The spectra in the absence of Mg2+ show downfield resonances for the native tRNALysASL and tRNALys-mnm5s2U34,39 with the greatest downfield shift seen for the native ASL in 10 mM Mg2+. These molecules also show a typical, general broadening of the 31P spectra when magnesium is added. NMR Assignment and NOE Structural Restraints. The nonexchangeable protons were assigned from 2D NOESY, COSY, and TOCSY experiments on the native tRNALys ASL and the two doubly modified tRNALys ASLs. The comparison of the native and the two undermodified ASLs was invaluable for making unambiguous assignments, and we were also aided by additional data for tRNALys-s2U34,39 (not shown) and tRNALys-39 (1). Sequential NOE connectivity (Figure 4, panel a) is seen from U27 to U33, and the relative NOE intensities indicate that the RNA conformation is essentially A-form throughout this region. The sugars are 3-endo with the exception of U33, which gives a cross-peak between the U33 H1 and H2 protons in the 2D TOCSY spectrum. A notable AH2 to H1 NOE is seen between A31H2 and C32 H1 indicated by the diagonal arrow in Figure 4, panel a. On the 3 side of the hairpin, NOE connectivity typical of a A-form geometry is seen from t6A37 to A43, and the sugars on this side are all 100% 3-endo. The 2D NOESY shows strong sequential NOEs between mnm5s2U34, U35, and U36, indicative of RNA A-form stacking. The NOEs for the base to H2, H3 protons (Supporting Information) confirm the sequential assignments, and the relative intensities show that the structure has a basically A-form geometry for the

anticodon. The A-form RNA connectivity is broken between U33 and mnm5s2U34 at the turn, with very weak mnm5s2U34 H6 to U33 H1 and H2 NOEs and no H6 to H3 NOE. NOEs are seen between the U33 H1 proton and the H5 protons of U35 and U36 (Figure 4, panel b), helping place the U33 imino proton within hydrogen bonding distance of the U35pU36 phosphate. The corresponding H6 to H1 NOEs were significantly overlapped with the U35 and H36 sequential NOEs; therefore, the restraints to U33 were based on the H5-H1 NOEs. NOEs involving methyl groups on the hypermodified nucleosides and for the NH11 amide proton of t6A37 are shown in Figure 4, panel c. The NH11 amide proton of t6A has NOE connectivity to the side chain protons and to t6A37 H2 and A38 H2 protons. The threonyl CH3, HR, and H protons give NOEs to A38 H2, and the CH3 has an NOE to A38 H1. The CH3 of the mnm5s2U34 side chain also has numerous internucleotide NOEs to both U33 and U35, as well as the intranucleotide NOEs to H6 and the CH2 group. A corresponding set of NOEs was seen for the CH2 group and helped confirm the assignment of the methyl NOEs. The complementary NOEs for the CH3 and CH2 groups position the side chain in the structures and provided long-range structural information in that key region. DISCUSSION CD Supports a ConVentional tRNA Conformation. Sulfurmodified uridine nucleosides have a long wavelength UV absorption with a maximum near 330 nm, and this contributes a band in the CD spectrum that is sensitive to local RNA structure (17, 37-39). The sign and intensity of the sulfur CD band can be used to monitor structural stability and even to probe base pairing interactions. An unconven-

12580 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 41, 2000 tional structure for tRNALys was first proposed based on a comparative CD study with tRNAGlu, which also has the hypermodified mnm5s2U nucleoside at position 34 in the anticodon (17). The structure of the tRNALys anticodon was proposed to be significantly different from that of tRNAGlu based on a positive CD band in tRNALys. This CD profile suggested that the mnm5s2U nucleoside was hydrogen bonded in tRNALys but not in tRNAGlu. A critical assumption was that mnm5s2U34 was the only sulfur-containing nucleoside in E. coli tRNALys. However, E. coli tRNALys contains 4-thiouridine (s4U) at position 8 in addition to mnm5s2U34. The positive CD band at 330 nm is very characteristic of the s4U8 nucleoside in tRNA (37), which forms the highly conserved reversed-Hoogsteen tertiary base pair with A14 (40, 41). The CD of our native tRNALys ASL (Figure 2, trace c) is different from that of the full-length, native tRNALys (Figure 2, trace a and reported previously) (17). The negative ellipticity indicates the structure of the tRNA anticodon does not contain an unconventional interaction involving mnm5s2U34. Furthermore, the similar CD spectra for oxidized tRNALys and the native tRNALys ASL indicate that the ASL is an appropriate model for the tRNALys anticodon. Proposing a structural model based simply on the CD spectra is problematic as we have shown, but a negative band for the ellipticity from mnm5s2U is consistent with a single-stranded environment. Secondary Structure and Stability. The downfield, imino proton NMR spectra in Figure 3 indicate that the native ASL and the two doubly modified ASLs form stable stem-loop structures. Slowly exchanging imino proton resonances are seen for the three internal Watson-Crick base pairs and for both the N3-H and N1-H imino protons of 39 in the A3139 base pair. Pseudouridine stabilizes each ASL, and the geometry of the A- base pair and stacking stabilization on the 3 side of the anticodon loop is similar to that of the tRNALys-39 ASL (1). The mnm5s2U34 modification has little effect on the imino spectrum and increases the thermodynamic stability by only 1.4 °C. While this effect is modest, we saw no change in the thermodynamic stability for tRNALys ASLs with the simple s2U34 modification. The effects of s2U without the side chain are complicated by a noticeable change in the nucleoside dynamics. The s2U34 H1 proton is significantly broadened in this ASL, and we also saw that the H5 protons of the loop uridines are broadened as was reported previously by Agris and coworkers (2). We found that the tRNALys-s2U34 ASL NMR spectrum is further complicated by duplex formation above approximately 300 µM concentration; however, the introduction of 39 in the tRNALys-s2U34, 39 ASL prevented duplex formation even at concentrations above 1 mM. The t6A modification destabilizes the ASL by about 2 °C and also diminishes the stabilizing effect of 39. It appears that the conformational effects of t6A that promote a nativelike anticodon structure place stress on the A31-39 base pair, resulting in destabilization of the stem. Another perspective that we believe is useful for interpreting this effect is that the native structure introduces conformational stress on the upper loop/lower stem region, and this in turn explains why the compensating effects of 39 modification are needed. The critical function of t6A is to adjust the stacking geometry between 36 and 37 and to promote a

Sundaram et al. conformation in the upper loop that allows for the U33 N3-H to 35p36 hydrogen bond (Figure 6). This interaction is a classic structural feature of the U-turn geometry and demonstrates that the tRNALys anticodon adopts a conventional tRNAPhe-like conformation (Figure 5). The U33 N3-H imino resonance and a downfield shifted 31P resonance for the 33p34 phosphate are the two characteristic NMR signatures of U-turns (43, 44, 46). Structural EnVironment of the Modified Nucleosides. Substantial stabilization of the anticodon loop structure occurs upon introduction of the modified nucleosides at positions 34 and 37. We have previously shown that the unmodified and 39-containing tRNALys ASLs are very dynamic with only weak stacking between U35-U36 and no NOEs to indicate base stacking between U34 and U35 (1). The 31P NMR spectrum of the native ASL has a single phosphorus resonance shifted significantly downfield of the envelope of resonances (20). This resonance was assigned to the 33p34 phosphate using 2D 1H-31P COSY and 1H-31P hetero-TOCSY-TOCSY experiments. The significant shift in the 31P NMR spectrum indicates either the R or angle is trans, consistent with a -turn geometry in the tRNA ASL (44, 45). We also observed a downfield shifted 33p34 phosphorus resonance for tRNALys-mnm5s2U34,39 (Supporting Information), indicating the phosphate backbone angle is also trans in the doubly modified ASL. In contrast, we saw no such NMR resonance for tRNALys-s2U34,39 or tRNALys-t6A37,39, indicating that for these ASLs the backbone is either unrestricted or adopts a standard A-RNA conformation. We believe that the additional conformational restriction is a simple result of steric restraints imposed by the mnm5 side chain, but an ionic interaction between the amine and the turning phosphate could also help position the wobble nucleoside. Preliminary data from our laboratory on mcm5s2U, the eukaryotic modification in human tRNALys,3, indicate that the structural effects are similar for the two hypermodified wobble nucleosides although the pattern of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors in the side chains is quite different. We think this also argues in favor of a steric role for the side chain. The position of the mnm5s2U side chain is well-defined by NOEs from the CH2 and CH3 of the side chain to sugar protons on U33 and to the H5 proton of U35 (Figure 6). Previous studies have shown that an ASL with s2U34 has significant ribosome binding activity (2). However, our NMR data indicate that there is a substantial structural difference between the ASL with only s2U34 and the fully modified tRNA. The introduction of the methylaminomethyl side chain causes a significant structural change; there is no indication of a U-turn for the s2U34 modified ASL. The ribosome binding experiments compared P-site tRNA binding affinities on poly(A) and poly(AG) mRNAs. This leaves open the possibility that the native tRNALys and partially modified tRNAs will show greater affinity differences at the ribosomal A-site, which is known to be the critical step for tRNA discrimination (47). The t6A side chain is oriented distal to the base imidazole ring as seen in the crystal structure of the nucleoside (48) and NOEs from NH11 to the t6A H2 proton place NH11 within hydrogen bonding distance of t6A37 N1. There are a large number of NOEs that define the conformation of the side chain, key NOEs defining the orientation of the side

chain relative to the base, and sequential NOEs that allow the t6A nucleoside to be accurately positioned in the structure (Figure 7). No NOEs are seen from the CH3 group of the t6A side chain to the mnm5s2U side chain. The stable interaction between U33 N3-H and the U35pU36 phosphate is a specific result of t6A modification since a slowly exchanging imino proton at 11.5 ppm was also seen for the tRNALys ASL that contains only 39 and t6A37 (Figure 3). Although we see no specific hydrogen bonds between functional groups on t6A and neighboring nucleosides, the modification clearly strengthens the U33 imino proton hydrogen bond to the U35pU36 phosphate. No particular

phosphate geometry was imposed during the refinement; therefore, the -turn geometry results entirely from the experimental NOE restraints. It appears that avoiding an unfavorable interaction between U33 O2 and the t6A amide oxygen increases helical twist, pushing the 35p36 phosphate toward the U33 imino proton. Westhof and co-workers have documented how the known tRNA anticodon structures are significantly overwound as compared to A-form RNA and have discussed the restrictions this places on the allowed sequence combinations (49). The t6A37 modification in tRNALys changes the unmodified ASL from a quite flexible structure into a structure having a well-stacked anticodon

The structural strain from t6A37 decreases the Tm by 2 °C, but this is compensated for by an almost equal increase from mnm5s2U34 and a further increase in stability from 39. Correction of PreVious Assignments. The NMR assignments and structural interactions in our tRNALys ASL differ significantly from that reported previously for a modified pentamer oligonucleotide (18). While we were not surprised that the structures differ, we found that some of our chemical shift assignments for the hypermodified nucleosides differed from those reported, and our assignments for intranucleotide NOEs contradicted those for the pentamer. We discovered that the 2D NOESY spectrum presented by Agris et al. (18) (their Figure 4) incorrectly assigned cross-peaks as due to internucleotide NOEs between mnm5s2U-34 and t6A-37 when these peaks are in fact intranucleotide NOEs. The peak assigned to mnm5s2U34 H1/t6A37 H8 is instead an NOE from t6A-37 H8 to t6A H1, and the peak assigned to t6A37 H5/mnm5s2U34 H6 is clearly the intrabase NOE between mnm5s2U34 H6 and the CH2 group of the mnm5 side-chain. The unambiguous data supporting the correct assignments are provided by the two doubly modified ASLs (Supporting Information) where only one of the hypermodified nucleosides is present, yet NOEs similar to those incorrectly assigned in the pentamer are still observed. The lack of long-

range NOEs in the pentamer, and few sequential base to H2 or H3 NOEs, indicates that this molecule adopts an extended conformation in solution. Comparison of tRNALys with Yeast tRNAPhe. The tRNALys structure is generally similar to the early tRNAPhe crystal structure (50), but a comparison of the upper loop region and the anticodon gives some insight into the degree to which certain tRNA structural elements are conserved. First, the A31H2 to C32H1 distance is 5.3 Å in the 2.5-Å crystal structure as compared to 4.1 Å in the tRNALys structure, resulting in different angles between the stem and the loop. Interestingly, in the recently refined 2.0-Å tRNAPhe crystal structure (51), this distance is decreased dramatically to 4.29 Å. The strong H2 to H1 NOE (Figure 4, panel a) we observe between A31 and C32 is typical for A-form stacking. This NOE was seen in all the partially modified tRNALys ASLs in solution and in unrelated ASLs of tRNALeu that also have A31 (Durant and Davis, unpublished). The structure in this region may be important for understanding the "extended anticodon" hypothesis of Yarus, which describes how the identities of the last two stem base pairs and the upper loop affect the function of the anticodon (52). The identity of tRNA isoacceptors is of course characterized by the anticodon sequence, but this in turn places specific restrictions on the sequence of the upper loop and the last two base pairs of the stem. This hypothesis was tested by functional analysis of tRNAs with unnatural combinations within the extended anticodon (52) and recently discussed in a detailed structural context by Auffinger and Westhof (49). The structural similarity between tRNALys and the recent tRNAPhe structure (51) supports the hypothesis that the structure in the upper loop might be conserved. A significant structural difference for tRNALys as compared to tRNAPhe is that there is some percentage of 2-endo conformation for all the residues from U33 to U36 in contrast to the 100% 3-endo residues in tRNAPhe. This implies that the anticodon residues still have some conformational flexibility, consistent with the still relatively weak U33 imino peak. Of the anticodon residues, the mnm5s2U34 wobble nucleoside has the lowest percentage of 2-endo conformation (<30%) as expected from the strong effect sulfur has on

tRNALys Anticodon Structure nucleoside conformation (53, 54), but U36 is approximately 50% 2-endo despite being adjacent to t6A37, which is 100% 3-endo. While it is often stated that the 3 side of the anticodon in tRNAPhe forms a continuous stack, in fact the base stacking is quite discontinuous between 36 and 37. The tRNALys structure exhibits this characteristic as well. There is a marked difference between the sugar conformation for U36 and t6A37, but in the tRNAPhe structure all the anticodon (purine) nucleotides are 3-endo in the crystal structure as well as in solution (43). Nevertheless, both the t6A37 modification in tRNALys and yW37 in tRNAPhe promote a stacking arrangement that is similar, with the hypermodified purine residue positioned to stack over the helix formed by the codon-anticodon complex rather than stacking directly on the third anticodon nucleotide (55, 56). The hypermodified nucleosides at position 37 in the two tRNAs also have the role of preventing a closed anticodon loop structure (1, 57). CONCLUSIONS The structure described here allows us to correct several misconceptions regarding tRNA structure and function. Studies of wobble pairing, frameshifting, or miscoding invariably invoke the potential for unusual structures to explain the unexpected tRNA behavior. This has been especially true of E. coli tRNALys since modifications have a dramatic effect on coding (13). Programmed -1 frameshifts in E. coli depend on the preference for AAA Watson-Crick pairing over AAG wherein the thiolated wobble nucleoside promotes slippage from G to A (12, 15). The effect of the wobble modification on misreading of asparagine codons (AAU/C) has been investigated, and the results were confusing in the context of previous models (16). The mnm5U34 mutant had decreased misreading, while it was hypothesized that this tRNA should have increased wobble, therefore more misreading of the noncognate codon. However, the codonanticodon interaction in the mnm5U34 containing tRNA lacks the stabilizing effects that the 2-thio would contribute to neighboring A-U interactions involving U35 and U36 (58). One could imagine then that the more disordered tRNALys mnm5U34 binds the asparagine codon poorly, while the more ordered tRNALys-mnm5s2U34 forms a stronger interaction at U35 and U36, which more than compensates for the poor geometry of the wobble U-U and U-C pairs (59). Thermodynamic measurements for U-U and U-C pairs show they provide half the stabilization of a canonical A-U pair, but the enthalpy for these interactions is still quite favorable (60). The high level of misreading by the native tRNALys can be explained by mnm5s2U stabilization of two out of three reading (61) and the lack of significant unfavorable interactions between the wobble base and the third codon nucleotide. The structure of the tRNALys ASL explains the preference for A over G simply by the thermodynamic stabilization of A-s2U as compared to G-s2U (62). A G-s2U wobble pair is simply less stable than an A-s2U Watson-Crick pair. The effect of the mnm5 modification is likewise explained since the side chain modification restricts the conformational freedom of the wobble base and promotes a canonical, tRNAPhe-like conformation. The U-turn structure of tRNALys holds the wobble nucleoside in a relatively rigid, nearly A-RNA conformation that in turn helps stabilize stacking with U35 and U36. Nucleoside modifications that promote

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 41, 2000 12583 a rigid loop conformation are particularly important for tRNALys function since the codon-anticodon interaction is mediated by three relatively weak uridine-containing base pairs (63). Preorganization is necessary in tRNALys to reduce the entropic cost for the formation of A-U base pairs that have relatively modest levels of enthalpic stabilization (60). The anticodon interaction with the HIV-1 A rich loop (5) is presumably stabilized for the same reason that modification is required for stable codon-anticodon interaction, a preorganized tRNA and favorable Watson-Crick pairing stabilized by a sulfur-modified nucleoside. The mnm5s2U nucleoside promotes an A-RNA conformation for the wobble nucleoside, stabilizes stacking of the anticodon nucleosides, and stabilizes the -turn phosphate conformation. The hypermodified t6A nucleoside promotes a base-stacking conformation in the upper loop that positions the 35p36 phosphate for hydrogen bonding with U33 and further stabilizes the U-turn. The modification pattern in tRNALysUUU is evolutionarily conserved and represents an elaborate, but apparently required, mechanism for stabilizing the tRNA anticodon structure.
