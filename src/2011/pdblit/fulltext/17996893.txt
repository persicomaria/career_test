Compatible solutes play a decisive role in the defense of microorganisms against changes in temperature and increases in osmolarity in their natural habitats. In Bacillus subtilis, the substrate-binding protein (SBP)-dependent ABC-transporter OpuA serves for the uptake of the compatible solutes glycine betaine (GB) and proline betaine (PB). Here, we report the determinants of compatible solute binding by OpuAC, the SBP of the OpuA transporter, by equilibrium binding studies and X-ray crystallography. The affinity of OpuAC/GB and OpuAC/PB complexes were analyzed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and the KD values were determined to be 17(G1) mM for GB and 295(G27) mM for PB, respectively. ° The structures of OpuAC in complex with GB or PB were solved at 2.0 A ° and 2.8 A, respectively, and show an SBP-typical class II fold. The ligandbinding pocket is formed by three tryptophan residues arranged in a prism-like geometry suitable to coordinate the positive charge of the trimethyl ammonium group of GB and the dimethyl ammonium group of PB by cation-p interactions and by hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate moiety of the ligand. Structural differences between the OpuAC/GB and OpuAC/PB complexes occur within the ligand-binding pocket as well as across the domain­domain interface. These differences provide a structural framework to explain the drastic differences in affinity of the OpuAC/GB and OpuAC/PB complexes. A sequence comparison with putative SBP specific for compatible solutes reveals the presence of three distinct families for which the crystal structure of OpuAC might serve as a suitable template to predict the structures of these putative compatible solute-binding proteins.

The intracellular water content of microorganisms exceeds that of the environment resulting in the build-up of a hydrostatic pressure, the turgor.1 An increase in the salinity of the environment will trigger osmotically instigated water fluxes across the permeability barrier of the cell, the cytoplasmic membrane. To avoid excessive water efflux, plasmolysis, molecular crowding of the cytoplasm and cessation of growth in high-salinity environments,2 many Bacteria and Archaea amass large amounts of

593 Crystallographic analysis of a considerable number of substrate-binding proteins has shown that they are generally composed of two rigid globular lobes that are connected by a variable number of hinge regions.25­27 In the ligand-free conformation, the so-called open form of the binding protein, the two globular domains are linked flexibly by the hinge regions.28,29 Upon substrate binding, a conformational change is induced in the hinge that generally causes a large rigid body motion that moves both globular domains towards each other.26,30 This hinge bending motion engulfs the ligand in a predefined cleft between the two globular domains of the substrate-binding protein and largely occludes it from the bulk solvent. The ligand-bound form of the substrate-binding protein is referred to as the closed conformation.26 The substrate-binding protein confers substrate specificity to a given bacterial binding proteindependent ABC-transporter.15 These types of binding proteins generally recognize and bind their ligands with high affinity, usually with KD values in the low micromolar or even nanomolar range.15,31 This is true also for the purified OpuAC ligand-binding protein of the B. subtilis OpuA transporter, which binds radiolabelled GB in vitro within an apparent KD of 6 mM, as assessed by an ammonium sulfate-precipitation assay.20 Ligand-binding proteins from bacterial ABC transport systems that are involved in compatible solute acquisition have to bind compatible solutes with specificity and high affinity.32,33 Therefore, these types of binding proteins have to avoid the exclusion of their ligands within the binding pocket that otherwise is generally observed for proteins.10,11 The recent crystallographic analysis of the GB/PB ligand-binding protein ProX from Escherichia coli32 and the Archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus33 have provided an initial insight into how such a task can be accomplished. In the E. coli ProX protein,32 a rectangular aromatic box formed by three Trp-residues provides an evenly structured negative surface to accommodate the bulky and positively charged trimethylammonium headgroup of GB and the dimethylammonium group of PB via cation-p interactions.34 The carboxylic groups of the GB and PB ligands are stabilized within the binding pocket through hydrogen bond interactions.32 Although the amino acid sequences of the ProX proteins from E. coli and A. fulgidus are only distantly related, a similar solution for GB/PB binding has been realized in the A. fulgidus ProX protein.33 Here, a girdle of four Tyr residues is key to binding of the quaternary amines of the ligands via cation-p interactions together with a contact to a main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom. Stabilization of the carboxylic groups of GB and PB is accomplished via either hydrogen bonds or saltbridges.33 The amino acid sequence of the OpuAC protein from B. subtilis is only very distantly related to those of the ligand-binding proteins ProX from E. coli or A. fulgidus. To further extend our understanding of

a particular class of low molecular mass organic osmolytes, the so-called compatible solutes.3­6 This can be accomplished either through biosynthesis or uptake from the environment through dedicated transport systems.4,5,7 Compatible solutes do not interfere with cellular functions and they can be amassed up to molar concentrations in the cytoplasm. Accumulation of compatible solutes triggers water entry into the cell, thereby allowing a re-hydration of the cytoplasm, a restoration of turgor and subsequently the resumption of cell growth under unfavorable osmotic conditions. In addition to their well-established role as osmoprotectants, compatible solutes function as protein stabilizers both in vitro8 and in vivo.9 This property of compatible solutes is generally explained in terms of the preferential exclusion model.10,11 One of the most widely used compatible solutes in nature is the trimethyl-ammonium compound glycine betaine (GB).12 Microorganisms that can acquire preformed compatible solutes from the environment have a growth advantage in highosmolality and high-salinity habitats.3­5,7 In the Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, five compatible solute transport systems are operational that, together, allow the acquisition of 12 preformed compatible solutes and of choline, the precursor for the synthesis of GB.13 One of these transport systems is OpuA (Opu, osmoprotectant uptake),14 a member of the binding protein-dependent ATPbinding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters.15­17 The OpuA system14 consists of a cytoplasmic membrane-associated ATPase (OpuAA),18 the membrane-spanning substrate translocator protein OpuAB,19 and the extracellular ligand-binding protein OpuAC.20 This latter protein is tethered to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane via a lipid modification at a Cys-residue at the mature N terminus of OpuAC.14,20 OpuAC binds GB with high affinity,20 and delivers it to the OpuAB/ OpuAA complex for the release of substrate from the ligand-binding protein and further ATP-dependent substrate translocation into the cytoplasm.18,19 The OpuA system contributes significantly to GB import when this compatible solute is used by B. subtilis for osmoprotective purposes,13,21 and serves for its uptake when it is used either as an effective heat22 or cold stress protectant.23 In addition to GB, the compatible solute proline betaine (PB) functions as an osmoprotectant for B. subtilis and is acquired by the cell via the OpuA transporter.13 Preliminary binding assays have revealed that PB is a substrate for the OpuAC ligand-binding protein (B. Kempf and E.B., unpublished results). The ligand-binding proteins of binding proteindependent ABC-transport systems either diffuse freely in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria or are tethered with a lipid tail to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-positive bacteria.15,20,24

594 the specific binding of compatible solutes by ligandbinding proteins of ABC transport systems, we have determined the crystal structure of the OpuAC protein with its natural ligands GB or PB at a ° ° resolution of 2.0 A and 2.8 A, respectively. This allowed us to deduce the molecular determinants that govern ligand binding by the OpuAC protein. In database searches, we found many bacterial and archaeal amino acid sequences related to the B. subtilis OpuAC protein. However, in most cases an efficient alignment of OpuAC with these protein sequences could be accomplished only when the N and C-terminal segments of the OpuAC protein were inverted. Remarkably, the three Trp residues that are key for substrate binding via cation-p interactions are conserved completely within the many proteins aligned with the B. subtilis OpuAC amino acid sequence. The OpuAC crystal structure represented here can thus be considered as a lead structure for many putative GB/PB ligand-binding proteins.

Structures of OpuAC in Complex with GB or PB

Results and Discussion
The OpuAC protein is tethered to the outside of the B. subtilis cytoplasmic membrane via a lipid modification at its N terminus.20 Such a lipid modification would obviously interfere with crystallization attempts of OpuAC. We therefore made use of a previously constructed MalE-OpuAC hybrid protein from which the OpuAC part (without lipid modification) can be released by proteolytic cleavage.20 OpuAC was then purified to apparent homogeneity as described in Materials and Methods. The oligomeric state of the purified OpuAC protein was verified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and showed a symmetric peak with an apparent mass of 28 kDa corresponding to monomeric OpuAC (calculated mass 30.3 kDa; data not shown). Equilibrium binding experiments of OpuAC with the natural substrates glycine betaine and proline betaine The binding properties of OpuAC towards its physiological ligands GB and PB were analyzed by equilibrium binding experiments following intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence35 in 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.3). OpuAC contains eight tryptophan residues spread throughout the sequence. In the absence of a ligand, an emission maximum at 346 nm was detected (Figure 1(a), red curve) which is characteristic for solvent-exposed Trp.36 The addition of a ligand, either GB or PB, resulted in an increase of fluorescence that was accompanied by a blue shift of the emission maximum. Under ligand saturation conditions, this shift amounted to 10 nm (Figure 1(a), black curve). Such an observation is indicative of a decrease in local polarity of at least part of the Trp residues, and can be rationalized by a ligand-induced shielding.

Figure 1. Binding properties of OpuAC/ligand complexes. (a) Emission spectra of OpuAC in the absence (red line) or in the presence of 0.5 mM GB (black line). (b) Equilibrium binding titration experiments with GB (&) or PB (:). The shift of the emission maximum in the presence of different amounts of ligand was analyzed according to equation (1).

The shift of the emission maximum was normalized and used to determine the affinity of the OpuAC/ ligand complexes according to equation (1) (Figure 1(b)). The dissociation constants of OpuAC/GB and OpuAC/PB complexes were calculated to be 17(G1) mM and 295(G27) mM, respectively. The determined value of the OpuAC/ GB complex is in agreement with the value (6 mM) determined by Kempf et al. using a radioactive filter assay,20 while no reference value for the dissociation constant of the OpuAC/PB complex exists. The results of the equilibrium binding experiments demonstrate that the dissociation constants of the OpuAC/GB and OpuAC/PB complexes differ by more than one order of magnitude, despite the fact that both ligands are natural substrates of OpuAC and share similar molecular characteristics, i.e. a carboxylate group and a fully methylated nitrogen atom. The strong difference in the affinity of the B. subtilis OpuAC protein for its natural ligands GB and PB is different from the situation observed for the binding of these compatible solutes by the E. coli and A. fulgidus ProX proteins, which both bind GB and PB with similar low affinities.32,33,37­39

595 residues were disordered in the crystal structure and have not been included in the model. Since OpuAC is tethered to the plasma membrane via a lipid modification at the N-terminal Cys,20 one would expect a high intrinsic flexibility in this part of the protein, explaining the observed disorder. The OpuAC protein can be divided into two globular domains (red and light magenta in Figure 2), which are formed by two central, fivestranded b-sheets flanked by several a-helices.26 This is in contrast to the closely related ProX protein from E. coli32 and A. fulgidus,33 which contained only a four-stranded b-sheet. Domain 1 (residues 4­94 and 253­272) harbors the N terminus and the C terminus, and consists of a b-pleated sheet (strands SA, SB, SC, SD and SJ) that is packed against five helices (H1­H4 and H13). In domain 2 (residues 100­247) the b-pleated sheet (strands SE, SF, SG, SH and SI) is flanked by eight helices (H5­H12). Residues 95­99 and 248­252 form the hinge region connecting both domains. The structure of OpuAC in complex with PB revealed an identical overall conformation (not shown). This fold is generally conserved for substrate-binding proteins (SBPs). Based on the topology of the five b-strands (order BACJD, see Figure 2, inset), OpuAC belongs to class

Crystal structure determination of the OpuAC/GB and OpuAC/PB complexes The structures of OpuAC in complex with the compatible solutes GB and PB were determined in the closed liganded conformation. Initial phases of a SeMet-substituted OpuAC/GB crystal were obtained from a three-wavelength multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) experiment (see Materials and Methods and Table 1). Since SeMet-substituted and native crystals of OpuAC/GB grew in different space groups, the SeMet crystal structure was refined to an Rfree value below 30% and subsequently used as molecular replacement template for the native data set. After refinement, the native OpuAC/GB structure was used to determine and refine the crystal structure of the OpuAC/PB complex (Table 1). A summary of the data statistics and refinement details as well as the model content are given in Table 1. Overall structure of the OpuAC/GB and OpuAC/PB complexes The overall structure of the OpuAC/GB complex is shown in Figure 2. The first four N-terminal

The ligand, which is coordinated by three Trp residues colored yellow, is shown in ball-and-stick representation. The inset shows the topology of OpuAC.

II of the SBP superfamily.25 The ligand GB, which is shown as sticks in Figure 2, is localized in a cleft between the two domains and flanked by strands SE and SI. Three tryptophan residues (shown as yellow sticks in Figure 2), Trp72, Trp178, and Trp225 stabilize the ligand inside the cleft. Architecture of the ligand-binding site The ligands, GB and PB, are bound in a deep groove between the two domains, which is composed of three Trp residues: Trp72 at the C terminus of SC, Trp178 N-terminal of H8 and Trp225 C-terminal of SH. The indole ring of Trp225 lies parallel with the b-pleated strands of domain 2 and is oriented perpendicular to the indole ring of Trp72 (Figure 2). The indole ring of Trp178 connects this geometry to an imaginary prism, the so-called Trpprism, whereby it is tilted to the base of the prism (Figure 3 and Supplementary Data Figure S1). The geometry of the Trp-prism is perfectly suited to coordinate the ligand by two distinct contributions: (i) cation-p interaction34 between the aromatic ring system of the indole moieties and the positive charge of the quaternary ammonium group that is delocalized across the four bound carbon atoms of GB and PB; and (ii) van der Waals interactions. Recently, the structure of ProX, the SBP of the compatible solute ABC-transporter ProU from E. coli, in complex with GB or PB was reported and exhibited similar features in ligand coordination.32 In addition to the cation-p interaction between the Trp-prism and the trimethyl ammonium group

of GB and PB, the carboxylate group of the ligands forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide groups of Gly26 and Ile27 (Figure 3 and Supplementary Data Figure S1). In the OpuAC/GB complex, a third interaction, a hydrogen bond with the side-chain of His230 (Figure 3(a)), was observed. In the case of the OpuAC/PB complex, the distance between the side-chain of His230 and the carboxylate moiety of PB has increased from ° ° 2.6 A to 4.7 A. While the distances of all other interactions between the ligand, GB or PB, and OpuAC remain constant within experimental error, the loss of the hydrogen bond between His230 and PB might explain the 17-fold higher dissociation constant of PB. Using the relation DGZKRTInK , the difference in dissociation constants of the two compatible solutes, 17(G1) mM for the GB/OpuAC and 295(G27) mM for the PB/OpuAC complex, accounts for a DDG value of 6.7 kJ/mol. Since the energy of a hydrogen bond lies between 4 kJ/mol and 20 kJ/mol, the loss of the single hydrogen bond between the carboxylate moiety of PB and His230 might explain the 17-fold increase in affinity of the two complexes. Furthermore, no water molecule is located within the ligand-binding cavity. In contrast, the oligopeptide transporter OppA40 uses water molecules to fine-tune its substrate specificity, demonstrating that specificity for the compatible solutes GB and PB by OpuAC is achieved solely by proper placement of the amino acid backbone and side-chains. A superposition of GB and PB complexes is shown in Figure 4. As evident, the carboxyl moieties of GB (cyan) and PB (green) are displaced, while

the trimethyl ammonium groups align fairly well. Also, Trp72, Trp225, and His230 coincide, but Trp178 and the backbone region between Gly26 and Ile27 are displaced. Most striking is the 1808 flip of the side-chain of Trp178. As a consequence of the

different orientation of the side-chain of Trp178, no cation-p interaction but eight van der Waals contacts are formed between PB and Trp178 (data not shown). Taken together, the strongly reduced affinity of OpuAC for PB is a result of the missing

598 hydrogen bond between His230 and the ligand, which creates a subtle difference in the architecture of the ligand-binding pocket, most evident in the 1808 flip of the indole side-chain of Trp178. Domain­domain interactions stabilizing the closed conformation The residues of OpuAC forming the ligandbinding pocket are localized in both domains in a rather even distribution. Gly26, Ile27, and Trp72 belong to domain 1, while Trp178, Trp225, and His230 are part of domain 2. As noted above, a major structural difference between the OpuAC/ GB and OpuAC/PB complexes is the additional hydrogen bond, which involves His230 located in domain 2. Since this additional hydrogen bond is present also in the OpuAC/GB crystal structure derived from a selenomethionine-substituted protein, which contained two monomers in the asymmetric unit in an arrangement very similar to the OpuAC/PB complex, an influence of crystal packing on the ligand­protein interaction can be excluded (data not shown). This additional interaction influences the network of interactions between both domains (Supplementary Data Figure S2), which stabilize the closed conformation of OpuAC. In the OpuAC/GB complex four interactions between the two domains were evident (Supplementary Data Figure S2A), whereas only three were observed in the OpuAC/PB complex (Supplementary Data Figure S2B). As a result, different levels of interactions are observed across the domain­domain interface in the OpuAC/GB and OpuAC/PB complexes. Taken together, these changes form the structural basis for the 17-fold decreased affinity for the two ligands, despite their similar chemical nature. Comparison of the OpuAC structure with that of the E. coli ProX protein To further evaluate structural principles governing the binding of the compatible solutes GB and PB, we compared the crystal structures of OpuAC from B. subtilis and ProX from E. coli (Figure 5).32 As shown in Figure 5(a), both proteins align well with ° an rmsd of 1.83 A using 251 Ca atoms. Also evident is a domain dislocation:25 domain 1 of OpuAC, which harbors the N terminus and the C terminus of the protein, superimposes with domain 2 of ProX and vice versa. Superposition of both proteins without employing the domain dislocation resulted ° in an rmsd of 2.4 A using 157 Ca atoms. On the other hand, both domains of OpuAC align with each ° other with an rmsd of 3.1 A using 51 Ca atoms. This emphasizes the presence of a domain dislocation in OpuAC and ProX. However, even after considering domain dislocation, one region of the structural alignment showed some degree of diversity. This stretch is located N-terminal to one of the two hinges of OpuAC and ProX (residues 95­99 and 231­235, respectively) and corresponds to a 17

Structures of OpuAC in Complex with GB or PB

residue insertion in ProX. On the basis of this superposition, a structure-based sequence alignment (Figure 7(b)) was constructed. Here, domain 1 of OpuAC is shown in red and domain 2 in dark blue, while domain 1 of ProX is shown in light blue and domain 2 in orange. To obtain this structurebased alignment, the sequences of OpuAC and ProX were split according to their domain boundaries. Despite the structural similarity of both proteins, which according to the DALI server belong to the leucine-arginine-ornithine (LAO)41 subfamily of SBPs,27 there is only 19% identity on the amino acid level (indicated by asterisks in Figure 5(b)). According to the sequence homology between the transmembrane part of the ABCtransporter, OpuAB and ProW, OpuAC and ProX belong to the OTCN subfamily of SBP-dependent ABC-transporters.42 Taking this ProX-specific insertion into account, one might speculate that a domain dislocation has occurred in the two proteins. The domain dislocation is further supported by the amino acid residues forming the ligand-binding pocket (Figure 5(c)). Two of the three Trp residues forming the Trp-prism of the B. subtilis protein (Trp72 and Trp225) and the residues coordinating the carboxylate group of GB (His230 and the backbone amide groups of Gly26 and Ile27) have counterparts located in the opposite domain of ProX (Trp188, Trp65, His69, Gly141, and Cys142). In contrast, Trp178 of OpuAC is located in domain 2, while the corresponding Trp of ProX, Trp140, is also located in domain 2. It is also interesting to note that OpuAC contains only a single cis-peptide bond at position 226. This coincides with the cis-peptide bond of ProX32 at position 66. As in ProX, this cis-peptide bond allows a sharp bend of the backbone, generating the proper environment for Trp225, which corresponds to Trp65 in ProX. However, the second cis-peptide bond in ProX at position 189 has no counterpart in OpuAC, which would be position 73. Thus, no restraint is imposed on the conformational flexibility of the adjacent Trp72 as it was proposed for ProX.32 Nevertheless, both, Trp72 of OpuAC and Trp188 of ProX align fairly well (Figure 5(c)) and the restriction of Trp188 by a cis-peptide bond is not necessary for the formation of the Trp-prism. Another striking difference from ProX is the absence of disulfide bonds in the structure of OpuAC. The conserved motif GCNPGWGC of ProX,32 where the two Cys residues forming a disulfide bond are highlighted in bold, possesses the homologue sequence GIDPGSGI in OpuAC and its five closest homologues, with the Cys replaced by Ile (highlighted in bold). Asp22 located in this sequence stretch forms a hydrogen bond with Trp178 across the domain­domain interface. This hydrogen bond does not exist in the OpuAC/PB structure and Trp178 has undergone a 1808 flip (Figure 4 and Supplementary Data Figure S2). Thus,

599 residues, one might conclude that the conservation throughout related SBPs serves to create a switch to stabilize the closed conformation of the SBP and ensure stable ligand binding either via disulfide bond formation (ProX) or domain­domain interactions (OpuAC).

despite the absence of disulfide bonds in OpuAC, a conformational restraint is imposed on Trp178 by a hydrogen bond across the domain­domain interface. Since both types of restraints, an intra-domain disulfide bond or an inter-domain hydrogen bond, originate from the same stretch of amino acid

Comparison with related compatible solutebinding proteins OpuAC-related proteins were identified via a BLAST search in the NCBI database. A representative set of these proteins is summarized in Figure 6. These proteins align directly with the sequence of OpuAC (Figure 6(a)) or after splitting OpuAC into two sequence stretches, which are different from the domain boundaries (Figure 6(b) and discussed below). The examples given in Figure 6 include Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria, cyanobacteria and archaea. In the case of Gram-positive bacteria, the alignment contains binding proteins, which are either tethered to the plasma membrane via a lipid modification at the processed N terminus,24,43 or fused to the C terminus of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the ABC-transporters.44,45 An example for these fused systems is OpuA from Lactococcus lactis.42,44 In archaea, SBPs can be anchored to the plasma

membrane via an N-terminal transmembrane segment,31 or through a lipid modification at a Cys residue at the mature N terminus.33 For clarity, the transmembrane segment of archaeal SBP and the TMD of the fused SBP of Gram-positive bacteria have been omitted from the alignment. Immediately evident from the alignment is the absolute conservation of the three Trp, residues (Trp72, Trp178, and Trp225) forming the Trp-prism (Figure 6). No other aromatic amino acid is tolerated in these positions, implying an absolute need for Trp. This is in contrast to ProX, in which the Trp residues forming the "Trp-box" can be conservatively exchanged to Tyr, phe or even to Ala in two cases.32 Furthermore, Asp22 (Supplementary Data Figure S2) is conserved (47% of all sequences). In the other sequences, the Asp is conservatively exchanged to Glu (53%). This further supports our notion that Asp22 is important. Another residue providing greater stability in the case of the OpuAC/ GB complex is His230. Although not conserved as

To visualize the individual domains of OpuAC, secondary structure elements of domain 1 are given in blue and secondary structure elements of domain 2 are given in red. Residues involved in ligand binding are indicated. Conserved residues have been highlighted in red. (a) Direct sequence alignments with other putative glycine betaine-binding proteins.

strictly as Asp22 and the three Trp residues, exchange of His230 occurs only by amino acids that are capable of forming salt-bridges or hydrogen bonds. Another interesting residue is Pro227, which enables cis-peptide bond formation at residue 226. Like the three Trp residues, Pro227 is absolutely conserved among all SBP analyzed. Obviously, one has to expect a cis-peptide bond at the corresponding position (position 226 in OpuAC). The sequence alignments presented can be subdivided in three distinct families. The first family (Figure 6(a)) can be aligned directly with OpuAC and comprises proteins such as the SBPs from Bacillus licheniformis or Listeria monocytogenes. The L. monocytogenes GbuC protein is the ligand-binding protein of a functionally characterized GB transporter

system.46 The second family includes SBPs such as ProX from E. coli (Figure 5(b)) or A. fulgidus (not shown), which align with OpuAC after taking the possibility of SBPs to undergo domain dislocations, which is described in detail by Fukami-Kobayashi et al., into account.25 This suggests that this sort of alignment might be useful to identify putative GBspecific SBPs. However, and to our big surprise, the largest family, family 3 (Figure 6(b)), was identified only after the sequence of OpuAC was split into two parts (part 1, residues 4­168, and part 2, residues 169­ 273). This split did not coincide with the structural domain definitions (structural domain 1, residues 4­ 94 and 253­272; structural domain 2, residues 100­ 247). The relation of family 3 therefore relies on a, so far unidentified, split of the sequence of SBPs, which

602 we term sequence domains (for further discussion see below). SBPs belonging to this class are, for example, the GB-binding protein OpuBC from L. lactis,44,45 or OtaC from Methanosarcina mazei.47 OpuBC from L. lactis is an example of ABC-transporters containing a fusion of SBP and TMD.42 The putative GB-binding proteins with such a fusion of the TMD with the SBP that have been identified in our sequence search are indicated by an asterisk in Figure 6(b) and comprise a substantial number of the putative GB-specific proteins. As shown in Figure 7(a), the two sequence domains (red and blue), which are the foundation of family 3, are located within the conserved lobes of OpuAC. A structural superposition using the central b-sheet as anchor points revealed an rmsd of

° 2.3 A between both sequence domains (Figure 7(b)), implying that some sort of duplication might have arisen from such an ancestor protein. The five helices located in sequence domain 1 have no counterpart in sequence domain 2. This region was identified by Fukami-Kobayashi et al. as a point of divergency in SBPs due to different insertions occurring at this location.25 Further support of the relevance of the identified sequence domains arises from a comparison of the Trp residues forming the Trp-prism in OpuAC. As shown in Figure 7(c), Trp72 and Trp225 align fairly well based on the superposition shown in Figure 7(b). On the other hand, Trp172 has no structural counterpart. This is reminiscent of the situation in ProX from E. coli. As pointed out above, Trp172 is not conserved between

OpuAC and ProX, while Trp72 and Trp225 coincide with Trp188 and Trp65. Obviously, the evolutionary aspects of the identified sequence domains need further inspection, but the sequence and structural analysis have established clearly that the crystal structure of OpuAC might serve as a template for three different families of SBPs able to bind compatible solutes.

proteins inspected. The B. subtilis OpuAC protein is thus a suitable model structure for a wide variety of binding proteins with a putative specificity for GB and PB, including the examples that are based on the newly identified sequence domains.

Conclusions
Here, we have described the structural characterization of the SBP OpuAC from B. subtilis and its functional interaction with its two main substrates, the compatible solutes GB and PB. Although similar in chemical structure, the equilibrium binding constants differed by a factor of w20. Based on the ° crystal structures, which were determined at 2.0 A ° (PB complex), it became (GB complex) and 2.8 A evident that a Trp-prism coordinates the delocalized positive charge of the ligand. However, different interactions between the amino acid residues that form the ligand-binding cavity of OpuAC and the carboxy moiety of GB and PB suggest a structural explanation for the different binding constants. Furthermore, the observed subtle difference in ligand coordination resulted in an alternate pattern of interactions in the domain­ domain interface, which correlates difference in KD with structural changes. Thus, the difference in affinity of the two substrates can now be explained structurally. Using the OpuAC amino acid sequence as a template for database searches, it became evident that the Trp residues forming the Trp-prism in OpuAC as well as other amino acid residues participating either in ligand binding or domain­ domain interactions are highly conserved in all

A soluble form of OpuAC (residues 22­274),20 lacking its signal peptide and Cys21, was produced as a fusion protein with the maltose-binding protein (MBP) and a factor Xa cleavage site using the expression plasmid pBKB76. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pBKB76 were cultivated in minimal medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose, 31 mM Na2HPO4, 19 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM sodium citrate, 10 mM MgSO4, 20 mg/l of FeCl3$6H2O, 4 mg/l of Zn(OAc)2$2H2O, 10 mg/l of thiamine/HCl and 100 mg/ml of ampicillin at 30 8C and 220 rpm. Protein expression was induced at A550Z0.8 with 1 mM IPTG for 3 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000g, 15 min, 4 8C) and lysed by ultrasonication. The cytosolic protein fraction was purified as described.20 In brief, the fusion protein was isolated by amylose-affinity chromatography. OpuAC was liberated by factor Xa proteolysis and separated from MBP and factor Xa by anion-exchange chromatography. To obtain homogenous protein, an additional SEC step was introduced using a Superdex 200 column (16/60 prep grade, Amersham Pharmacia, Freiburg) equilibrated with TBS buffer (10 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.3). Fractions corresponding to monomeric OpuAC were pooled if purity was greater than 99% (as judged from SDS-PAGE), concentrated to 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra, 5 kDa MWCO, Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) and stored at 4 8C until further use. Protein concentration was determined spectroscopically at 280 nm using a theoretical molar extinction coefficient of 60,900 MK1 cmK1.

For seleno-methionine (SeMet) substituted OpuAC, cells were grown in glucose minimal medium (see above), supplemented prior to induction with 100 mg each of Lys, Phe and Thr (10 mg/ml) and 50 mg each of Ile, Leu and Val (5 mg/ml) to inhibit methionine biosynthesis. Incorporation of SeMet was achieved by subsequent addition of 60 mg of L-SeMet (6 mg/ml). SeMet-substituted OpuAC was purified and stored as described above. Ligand binding experiments To assess the binding affinity of OpuAC for GB (purchased from Sigma) or PB (purchased from Extrasynthese, France), intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of OpuAC was monitored from 305 nm to 450 nm using a Flurolog (Horiba, Edison, NJ, USA). The excitation wavelength was set to 295 nm, slit-width of 5 nm, and temperature was maintained at 22(G1) 8C using a circulating waterbath. Different amounts of GB or PB in 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.3) (from a 0.5, 5.0 or 50 mM stock solution) were added to OpuAC samples (250 nM in 10 mM Tris­ HCl, pH 7.3) and fluorescence was measured 5 min after ligand addition to allow for equilibration. Spectra in the presence and in the absence of protein were subtracted and the maximum emission wavelength (lem,max) was determined by an automated peak search routine using the program DataMax (Jobin Yvon-Spex Instruments, Edison, NJ, USA). Upon binding of ligand to OpuAC, a blue shift of lem,max from 345 nm in the absence of ligand to 336 nm under conditions of ligand saturation was observed. This shift was normalized according to equation (1) and used to determine the dissociation constants of OpuAC/GB or OpuAC/PB complexes, respectively. All data represent the average of three independent measurements with the standard deviations given as errors. lKl0 L0 Z lN Kl0 KD KL0 (1)

Data collection, structure determination and refinement A three-wavelength MAD data set from a single SeMetsubstituted OpuAC/GB crystal and native data sets from single OpuAC/GB and OpuAC/PB crystals were collected at beamline BW-6 (DESY, Hamburg) with an MAR CCD and were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK.48 After localization of 16 of the 20 expected SeMet sites of the MAD data set using SHELXD,49 an initial electron density of OpuAC/GB was determined using SOLVE and RESOLVE.50 After the initial model was built in O,51 REFMAC 5 was used in the subsequent refinement steps.52 The model for the SeMet-substituted OpuAC/GB ° structure was refined to 2.7 A by manual building into the FobsKFcal and 2FobsKFcal electron densities. Since the SeMet-substituted and native crystals of OpuAC/GB crystallized in different space groups (Table 1), it was necessary to refine the model of the SeMet-substituted crystal to an Rfree value below 30%. The structure of the native OpuAC/GB data set was subsequently solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe with the refined structure of the SeMet-substituted OpuAC/GB crystal as template.53 Model building and refinement were again performed iteratively in O and REFMAC5. Automated water picking was performed using ARP/ wARp54 with a cut-off of 3s for individual water molecules that were checked manually for appropriate density. 5% of the data was excluded from refinement to calculate the Rfree value for cross-validation. The quality of the model was verified with PROCHECK,55 and the resulting parameters are summarized in Table 1. The OpuAC/PB model was calculated by molecular replacement using AMoRE and the native OpuAC/GB structure as template. Model building and refinement were again performed iteratively in O and REFMAC5. In the early stages of refinement, strict non-crystallographic symmetry between the two monomers was applied, which was released in the last four cycles of refinement. Data Bank search and sequences alignment Protein homologues of OpuAC were searched via the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTAL W, taking possible domain dislocations (derived from the structural boundaries of both domains of OpuAC) into account using the Vector NTI software package. The sequence domains were detected upon manual inspection of sequences, which had been aligned dierectly. Here, it became evident that, for example, the Trp residues forming the ligand-binding pocket could not be aligned properly without applying a split of OpuAC at the indicated positions. Structure alignments Structure alignments were performed using LSQMAN employing standard settings. Figure preparation Structure Figures were prepared using PYMOL.

Here, l is the maximum emission wavelength. Indices 0 and N indicate the absence of ligand and conditions of ligand saturation, respectively. L0 denotes the ligand concentration and KD is the dissociation constant of OpuAC/GB or OpuAC/PB complexes, respectively. Crystallization Crystals of OpuAC were obtained by the hanging-drop technique. Prior to crystallization, OpuAC at a concentration of 10 mg/ml was incubated with 1 mM GB or 3 mM PB for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, 1 ml of protein solution was mixed with 1 ml of reservoir solution and 0.5 ml of 100 mM L-cysteine. The reservoir solution contained 100 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.25), 150 mM NH4OAc and 15% (w/v) PEG 4000. Crystal needles appeared at 274 K between 48 h and 72 h, and grew to their final dimensions (300 mm!100 mm!50 mm) within two weeks. Appropriate crystals were transferred into cryo-buffer (150 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.25), 20% (w/v) ethylene glycol, 200 mM NH4OAc, 20% (w/v) PEG 4000) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Under identical conditions, SeMet-substituted OpuAC/GB produced only small needles that showed a weak and anisotropic diffraction pattern. Crystal quality and dimensions were improved by crystallizing at 295 K and by refining the concentrations of NH4OAc to 50 mM and PEG 4000 to 12% (w/v). Crystals of the SeMet-substituted OpuAC/ GB were transferred directly into cryo-buffer and flashfrozen in liquid nitrogen.
