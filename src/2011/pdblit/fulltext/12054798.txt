Abstract 3-Isocyano-1,2-dicarba-closo- dodecaborane, otherwise referred to as 3-isonitrilecarborane (L), reacts with [NEt4]2[Re(CO)3Br3] and [Re(CO)3(solv.)3] ' in a manner similar to that of aliphatic isonitriles resulting in the formation of compounds of the general formulae [Re(CO)3L2Br], [Re(CO)3L3] ' and [Re(CO)3L2L?], where L? denotes a nido-carborane isonitrile ligand. The latter compound, whose structure was determined crystallographically, has an overall neutral charge as a result of a deboronation reaction which takes place upon recrystalization of the complex. We also observed that the ligand L has the ability to displace CO ligands from [Re(CO)3(solv.)3] ' , which led to the formation of [Re(CO)2L4]' . # 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a binary approach to cancer treatment originally proposed by Locher in 1936 [1] that entails exposing cells enriched with 10B with thermal neutrons. One of the allures of BNCT is its potential for achieving selective cell killing [2,3]. This feature is a consequence of the fact that the daughters of the boron neutron capture reaction, an alpha particle and lithium ion, traverse a distance which is similar to the diameter of a typical cell [4], thereby depositing highly ionizing radiation within a confined area. A related technique, boron neutron capture synovectomy (BNCS) [5,6], has been recently proposed as a way of treating severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis that do not respond to conventional therapies and as a potentially safer and more selective alternative to radiation synovectomy. Because pharmacokinetics, in addition to the selectivity, plays an important role in achieving successful

therapeutic outcomes, a number of researchers have begun using clinical imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [7,8] and positron emission tomography (PET) [9] to evaluate new BNCT/BNCS agents in both animal models and in human subjects. The latter technique, along with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [10], is a particularly attractive means of rapidly evaluating compounds in animals, as opposed to the arduous and expensive method of measuring boron concentrations in excised animal tissue samples. The opportunity for using imaging modalities for this type of research is greatly enhanced with the advent of dedicated small animal PET and SPECT scanners [11,12]. We are interested in developing a highly flexible class of targeted BNCT/BNCS agents that will allow for the inclusion of diagnostic radionuclides without changing the overall structure of the parent compound. Our proposed strategy (Fig. 1) involves the preparation of transition metal-derived BNCT agents in which a bifunctional carborane, linked to a targeting agent, is coordinated to a metal (M) through a donor group (X). By increasing the coordination number, through the judicious choice of M and X, the number of boron

2.1. Reaction of compound 1 with [Re(CO)3Br3]2( The isonitrile 1, which was prepared following a literature method [16], was heated with the [NEt4]2[Re(CO)3Br3] in THF overnight (Scheme 1) and the product, Re(CO)3L2Br, isolated by either preparative TLC or radial chromatography (20%). IR of 2 shows a series of CO stretches at 2042, 2004 and 1956 cm (1, which are consistent with the expected symmetry of the product. These values are in reasonable agreement with the stretches reported for fac -Re(CO)3(CNMe)2Br [17]. The BH stretch is observed at 2602 cm (1, while the CN stretches are within expected values appearing at 2183 and 2132 cm (1. The negative ion ESMS of the product contains the molecular ion at an m /z value of 687.5 and simulation of the spectrum is consistent with the isotopic distribution pattern expected for 2. At 96 MHz, the 1H decoupled 11B-NMR spectrum of 2 exhibited resonances at (/1.76, (/8.53, (/12.22, and (/13.29 ppm, which is consistent with two closo carborane cages. The 13C-NMR shows two peaks shifted downfield at 183.94 and 181.54 ppm corresponding to the CO and CN groups, respectively. The 13CNMR also indicates the presence of the carborane CH groups at 57.47 and 57.23 ppm. The 1H-NMR exhibited a broad peak associated with the BH groups and one other resonance corresponding to the carborane CH.

atoms in a given molecule can be increased and furthermore, the metal can be conveniently interchanged with a radioactive isotope of M, without altering the structure of the complex. Having multiple biomolecules in one complex (i.e. for values of n /1) also presents the opportunity for achieving enhanced receptor selectivity through multi-valent binding effects. Herein we describe the synthesis and characterization of a model system which utilizes rhenium as the core metal and 3-isonitrilecarborane as the boron containing ligand. This particular system was selected because isonitrile complexes of 99mTc are widely used in clinical nuclear medicine and therefore have some of the intrinsic properties (stability, ease of synthesis in water, etc.) that are needed to construct metal-based BNCT agents. The goal of this work was to study the coordination chemistry of the carborane ¡/isonitrile ligand in comparison to aliphatic isonitriles, as a means of evaluating the suitability of this ligand system for the synthesis of Re/99mTc-derived BNCT and BNCS agents.

2.2. Crystal structure of 2 2. Results and discussion Zakharkin et al. reported the synthesis of a series of metal complexes using 3-isonitrilecarborane (L) 1 including [Re(CO)3L2Br], which was prepared from Re(CO)5Br [13]. Unfortunately, the extent of characterization of the reported compounds was typically limited to elemental analysis and IR. Moreover, Re(CO)5Br is an unsuitable starting material with respect to our long term goals because the corresponding 99mTc analogue is not currently accessible. We therefore sought to thoroughly investigate the reaction of 3-isonitrilecarborane with [Re(CO)3X3]n (X 0/Br, n 0/(/2; X 0/THF, n0/'/1) [14], for which the analogous 99mTc complexes are readily available and frequently used for labelling biomolecules [15]. Single crystals of compound 2 were isolated and the structure is shown in Fig. 2. The compound contains two isonitriles and one bromide ligand and three CO ligands having the expected facial geometry. The compound crystallized with disordered THF in lattice. ∞ The average Re √/(CO) distance (Table 1) is 1.976(6) A ∞ ranging from 1.958(5) to 1.985(6) A, the shortest being the ligand trans to the bromine. The C √/O bond ∞ distances are 1.088(5), 1.134(5) and 1.132(6) A, while ∞ the bromine√/metal distance, 2.635(6) A, clearly demonstrates the strong trans influence of the opposing CO ligand. The Re √/CNR bond distances are similar (2.075(5) ∞ and 2.063(5) A) and only slightly shorter than the corresponding distances in Tc(CO)3(CNt Bu)2Cl [14].

previously treated with Ag ' in THF to replace the bromide ligands with THF molecules. After heating to reflux overnight, TLC analysis of the reaction mixture showed a mixture of products, which were isolated chromatographically. The main reaction product was the tri-substituted metal complex 3a, which is in agreement with the observations reported by Alberto and coworkers who used t BuNC as a ligand. The ESMS of 3a is consistent with the calculated mass of the proposed target having an isotopic distribution characteristic of a ReB30 species. The IR showed n(CN) and n(CO) stretches at 2178, 2122, 2098 cm (1 and 2038, 2007, 1948 cm (1, respectively, which are consistent with the peaks observed for [Re(CO)3(CNtol)3][PF6] [17]. The 11B-NMR of 3a, having peaks at (/2.45, (/3.69, (/7.37, (/9.76, and (/13.56 ppm, indicates that the cages are all closo in nature. 2.4. Crystal structure of 3b Single crystals of 3b were isolated after a slow evaporation of the reaction solvent in air and used to acquire the X-ray structure shown in Fig. 3. Upon refinement it was noted that the thermal occupancy for atom B(6) appeared to deviate from the accepted value for boron. This suggested that one of the three carborane cages underwent degradation to the corresponding nido cluster. The occupancy of the B(6) atomic position, when given a free variable, converged to 66% upon least-squares refinement. Similar treatment of other non-restrained atoms B(7), B(8) and B(12), confirmed complete (100%) occupancy at these sites. The remainder of the structure was determined from the corresponding symmetry elements inherent to the rhom-

∞ The CN bond distances are 1.164(6) and 1.161(6) A, which are very similar to that of the free ligand (1.157(4) ∞ A) indicating little p-back donation from the metal to the isonitrile ligands. The N(1) √/C(1) √/Re(1) and N(2) √/ C(2) √/Re(1) bond angles are nearly linear (178.1(5) and 177.0(4)8, respectively). Like that of the CN bond, the distances between the nitrogen atoms of the isonitriles and the boron atoms of the carboranes are on average very similar to the same distance for the free ligand. The structures of the carboranes themselves are unexceptional. 2.3. Reaction of compound 1 with [Re(CO)3(solv.)3]' Alberto et al. have demonstrated that it is possible to bind three isonitriles ligands to the [Re(CO)3] ' core by replacing the halide ligands with solvent (solv.) molecules prior to treatment with the desired ligand [18]. Following a similar procedure (Scheme 1), compound 1 was reacted with [Re(CO)3Br3]2(, which had been

bohedral R 3m space group. The final solution shown in Fig. 3 has the missing boron vertex `spread' over the three carborane clusters which gives the false impression that all cages are closo . The 11B-NMR of 3a, immediately after isolation (vide supra) clearly indicates that all three carborane cages are in fact closo . A 11B{1H} spectrum of the recrystallized material however, shows a substantially more complicated pattern clearly indicating that at least one of the clusters was converted to the nido-carborane during the prolonged crystallization process. The conversion of dicarba-closo- dodecaboranes to the corresponding nido-carboranes is typically brought about through the use of strong bases such as alkoxides [19], secondary amines [20,21] or fluoride ion [22]. There have been reports of the degradation of closo -carboranes under very mild conditions [23], however, the same reaction for carboranes substituted at the 3-position has not, to the best of our knowledge, been previously described. It is clear that coordination to the metal influences the compound to convert to the nido-cluster under milder conditions that of the free ligand which we have found to be stable in solution for prolonged periods of time. The formation of the nido-carborane in 3b is further supported by the absence of any counter ion in the solid state structure which is consistent with the overall neutral charge of the deboranated complex. Compound 3b has a facial arrangement of CO ligands and three 3-isonitrilecarborane substituents. The ∞ Re √/(CO) distance in 3b is 2.01(2) A which is slightly longer than the corresponding distance in [Tc(CO)3(CNt Bu)3][NO3] [18]. The Re √/CNR distance ∞ ∞ is 2.08(2) A while the CN distance is 1.19(2) A, which is a little longer than that for compound 1. The distance between the nitrogen atom and the carborane cage is ∞ 1.451(19) A and the C(2) √/Re(1) √/C(1) and C(1) √/N(1) √/ B(3) angles are nearly linear at 178.6(11) and 173.4(18)8, respectively. 2.5. Higher coordination numbers During the reaction of 1 with [Re(CO)3(solv.)3] ' a second product was isolated from the reaction mixture. Positive ion ESMS indicates that the product's formula is [Re(CO)2(CNR)4] ' and the observed isotopic distribution pattern is in fact consistent with a ReB40 distribution. The carboranes in 4 according to ESMS and NMR experiments do not degrade, unlike what was observed for compound 3a, to form the corresponding nido-carboranes. The IR of 4 shows n(BH) at 2604 cm (1, n(CN) at 2210, 2140 and 2095 cm (1 and n(CO) at 2025 and 2002 cm (1. The patterns observed for the CN and CO stretches are consistent with the formation of a cis isomer [17]. The substitution of a CO ligand directly from the [Re(CO)3] ' core is not typically observed especially

using simple isonitriles ligands and relatively mild reaction conditions. It has been reported however, that [Re(CO)2(CNtol)4][PF6] can be prepared from Re(CO)3(CNtol)2Br under similarly benign reaction conditions [17]. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts, an X-ray structure of 4 could not be obtained to unambiguously establish its structure. The isolation of 4 motivated us to look at the ESMS of the crude reaction mixture which contained compounds 3a and 4 to see if there were any other derivatives of the type [M(CO)n (L)6(n ] (n 0/0 or 1). Perhaps most interestingly, the positive ion ESMS showed a peak at 1202 having a ReB60 distribution which is consistent for formation of the hexakis derivative [Re(L)6] '. Unfortunately, the hexakis(isonitrile)Re(I) complex could not be isolated in appreciable quantities, however, the fact that we observed the product in ESMS suggest that it is possible to prepare a compound having six 3-isonitrilecarborane ligands around the metal center. This compound, which is the Re-carborane analogue of the hexakis(isocyanide) technetium complexes, prepared nearly 20 years ago [24], has 60 boron atoms and would therefore, as mentioned in Section 1, would be another attractive platform from which to construct metal-based BNCT and BNCS agents.

3. Conclusion 3-Isonitrilecarborane reacts with the [Re(CO)3] ' core in a manner similar to that of aliphatic isonitriles resulting in compounds of the general formulae Re(CO)3L2Br, [Re(CO)3L3] ' and [Re(CO)3L2L?]. Two of these compounds were characterized crystallographically. In addition, we observed that compound 1 has the apparently unique ability to displace CO ligands from [Re(CO)3(solv.)3] ', which led to the formation of [Re(CO)2L4]'. We are currently investigating the analogous chemistry with 99Tc and 99mTc.

THF and Et2O were distilled under nitrogen from sodium and benzophenone. ortho -Carborane was purchased from Katchem Ltd. (Czech. Rep.) Analytical TLC was performed on silica gel 60-F254 Merck). Boron compounds were visualized with 0.1% PdCl2 in HCl (3.0 M), which upon heating gave dark brown spots. NMR spectroscopy experiments were performed on Bruker AV200, AV300 and DRX500 spectrometers. Tetramethylsilane and BF3 ¡/Et2O were used as internal standards for 1H and 11B spectra, respectively. For

Samples were dissolved in 50:50 CH3CN ¡/H2O. IR spectra were run on a Bio-Rad FTS-40 FTIR spectrometer. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction data was collected with a Bruker SMART-1K CCD detector on a P4/RA diffractometer equipped with an Oxford Cryostream cooling system. The diffraction experiments were carried out with graphite-monochromated Mo ¡/Ka X-radiation ∞ (l0/0.71753 A). Single crystals were mounted on the tips of glass fibers. Accurate cell parameters were determined at 173 K from a refinement of the setting angles (x, f , and 2u ) obtained from a chosen number of centered reflections in reciprocal space using the SMART [25] software. The SAINT program [26] was used to integrate the raw frame data and the structures were solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 for structure solution using the SHELXTL PLUS package [27]. Corrections were made to the integrated diffraction spots by applying Lp corrections. The SADABS program [28] was used for the application of a decay correction, and an empirical absorption correction based on redundant reflections Table 2. Compound 2 crystallized in the monoclinic P21/n space group (Z 0/4) and crystallographic data are given in Table 3. A significant amount of electron density observed in the difference map was modeled as disordered solvent and assigned as oxygen, which is representative of the recrystallization solvent THF. All solvent atoms were assigned variable partial occupancy with isotropic thermal parameters. Hydrogen atoms were added as fixed contributors at calculated positions with isotropic thermal parameters, based on the atom to which they were bound. Compound 3b crystallized in the highly symmetrical rhombohedral R 3m space group (Z 0/3). Crystallographic data are given in Table 3.
