ABSTRACT: The solution structure of the N1-(1-hydroxy-3-buten-2(S)-yl)-2-deoxyinosine adduct arising from the alkylation of adenine N1 by butadiene epoxide (BDO), followed by deamination to deoxyinosine, was determined, in the oligodeoxynucleotide d(CGGACXAGAAG),d(CTTCTCGTCCG). This oligodeoxynucleotide contained the BDO adduct at the second position of codon 61 of the human N-ras protooncogene, and was named the ras61 S-N1-BDO-(61,2) adduct. 1H NMR revealed a weak C5 H1 to X6 H8 NOE, followed by an intense X6 H8 to X6 H1 NOE. Simultaneously, the X6 H8 to X6 H3 NOE was weak. The resonance arising from the T17 imino proton was not observed. 1H NOEs between the butadiene moiety and the DNA positioned the adduct in the major groove. Structural refinement based upon a total of 364 NOE-derived distance restraints yielded a structure in which the modified deoxyinosine was in the high syn conformation about the glycosyl bond, and T17, the complementary nucleotide, was stacked into the helix, but not hydrogen bonded with the adducted inosine. The refined structure provided a plausible hypothesis as to why this N1 deoxyinosine adduct strongly coded for the incorporation of dCTP during trans lesion DNA replication, both in Escherichia coli [Rodriguez, D. A., Kowalczyk, A., Ward, J. B. J., Harris, C. M., Harris, T. M., and Lloyd, R. S. (2001) EnViron. Mol. Mutagen. 38, 292-296], and in mammalian cells [Kanuri, M., Nechev, L. N., Tamura, P. J., Harris, C. M., Harris, T. M., and Lloyd, R. S. (2002) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 15, 1572-1580]. Rotation of the N1 deoxyinosine adduct into the high syn conformation may facilitate incorporation of dCTP via Hoogsteen-type templating with deoxyinosine, thus generating A-to-G mutations.

1,3-Butadiene (CAS RN 106-99-0) (BD)1 is used in the manufacture of styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) (1, 2); several billion pounds per year are produced in the United States. It is a combustion product from automobile emissions (3) and cigarette smoke (4). BD is genotoxic and is a carcinogen in rodents, particularly in mice (5-7) and also in rats (8). Recently, BD was classified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as "carcinogenic to humans by inhalation" (9). The International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) lists BD as a "probable human carcinogen" (Group 2A) (10). Chronic human exposure in the SBR

industry may induce genotoxic effects (11-13) and is correlated with increased risk for leukemia (1, 14-22). BD is epoxidized primarily by cytochrome P450 2E1, but also by cytochrome P450 2A6, to form 1,2-epoxy-3-butenes (BDO) (Scheme 1) (23, 24). BDO is a reactive electrophile that can potentially alkylate nucleophilic sites in DNA, including the imine nitrogen at N1 of deoxyadenosine. Alkylation could occur from either carbon atom of the oxirane; attack by the interior carbon atom, designated C , yields two possible stereoisomers of the N1-(1-hydroxy-3buten-2-yl)-2-deoxyadenosine adduct. These initially formed N1-dA adducts are prone to deamination (25), which yields two possible stereoisomeric N1-(1-hydroxy-3-buten-2-yl)2-deoxyinosine adducts (Scheme 2). Deamination of dA represents a promutagenic event because during DNA replication, the resulting dI nucleotide is recognized as dG and preferentially pairs with incoming dCTP during DNA replication. However, in the N1-(1hydroxy-3-buten-2-yl)-2-deoxyinosine adducts, dI is alkylated at the N1 position, thus blocking base pairing with dCTP. Nevertheless, when ligated into the single-stranded vector M13mp7L2 that was used to transfect repair-deficient AB2480 (uVrA-, recA-) and SOS-proficient AB1157 Escherichia coli, the N1-(1-hydroxy-3-buten-2(S)-yl)-2-deoxyinosine adduct strongly coded for incorporation of dCTP (26).

Scheme 2: The Adducted ras61 Oligodeoxynucleotide, the Chemical Structure of the N1-(1-Hydroxy-3-buten-2(S)-yl)2-Deoxyinosine Adduct, and Nomenclature2

Studies of this adduct in COS-7 cells yielded similar results (27). A structural hypothesis was proposed, which posited that incorporation of dCTP opposite the N1-(1-hydroxy-3buten-2(S)-yl)-2-deoxyinosine adduct occurred as a result of rotation of the N1-adducted dI into the syn conformation
2 The definitions of the prochiral protons at CR of the BDO adduct are based upon the Cahn, Ingold, and Prelog nomenclature. The proton HR is defined as the pro-R proton at CR; HR is defined as the pro-S proton at CR. At C, H was defined as the proton in the trans configuration with respect to H, whereas H was defined as the proton in the cis configuration.

about the glycosyl bond, thus enabling formation of a protonated dI,dC Hoogsteen pair during translesion synthesis (27). Accordingly, the N1-(1-hydroxy-3-buten-2(S)-yl)-2-deoxyinosine adduct was site-specifically incorporated into the ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide (28). The resulting oligodeoxynucleotide, 5-d(CGGACXAGAAG)-3,5-d(CTTCTTGTCCG)-3, contained the N1-(1-hydroxy-3-buten-2(S)-yl)-2deoxyinosine adduct at the second position of codon 61. This was named the ras61 S-N1-BDO-(61,2) adduct (Scheme 2). The solution structure, as refined from NMR data, confirmed the rotation of the glycosyl bond of the S-N1BDO-(61,2) adduct into the high syn conformation, thus placing the butadiene moiety into the major groove. The complementary dT remained intrahelical at the adduct site. The results support the hypothesis that the tendency of the ras61 S-N1-BDO-(61,2) adduct to code for incorporation of dCTP may be attributed to the propensity of this adduct to form a protonated Hoogsteen pairing interaction with dCTP during trans lesion replication. The deamination of initially formed N1 alkylation products arising from BDO, and possibly other electrophiles arising from metabolism of butadiene, may represent the source of H-ras specific A-to-G mutations observed in vivo (27). MATERIALS AND METHODS Oligodeoxynucleotide Synthesis. The unmodified oligodeoxynucleotides 5-d(CGGACAAGAAG)-3 and 5-d(CT-

N1 Beta-Hydroxyalkyl Deoxyinosine Adduct TCTTGTCCG)-3 were synthesized by the Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) and purified by anion-exchange chromatography. The concentrations of these single-stranded unmodified oligonucleotides were determined from calculated extinction coefficients at 260 nm; the concentration of the modified single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide was determined from the calculated extinction coefficient of 9.08 × 104 cm-1 at 260 nm (29). To prepare the modified duplex 5-d(CGGACXAGAAG)-3,5-d(CTTCTTGTCCG)-3 an excess of unmodified strand was annealed with the S-N1BDO-(61,2) modified strand (30), in a buffer consisting of 10 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, and 50 µM Na2EDTA at pH 7.0. The solution was heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The resulting mixture of single-stranded and duplex DNA was equilibrated in 10 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, 50 µM Na2EDTA at pH 7.0 on a column containing DNA Grade Biogel hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The DNA was eluted off the hydroxylapatite with a gradient from 10 to 200 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, to separate excess single-stranded from duplex DNA. The duplex was lyophilized, resuspended in 1 mL of H2O, and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column. The sample was lyophilized. NMR Spectroscopy. The S-N1-BD sample was prepared at a DNA strand concentration of 1.3 mM dissolved in 300 µL of 10 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM NaCl, 50 µM EDTA buffer at pH 7.0. For observation of nonexchangeable protons, it was dissolved in 99.96% D2O. The temperature was controlled at 22 °C ( 0.5 °C. For observation of exchangeable protons, the sample was dissolved in 9:1 H2O/D2O. The temperature was controlled at 10 ( 0.5 °C. To derive distance restraints, NOESY experiments were acquired at mixing times of 200, 250, 300, and 350 ms at a 1 H frequency of 800.23 MHz. For examination of exchangeable protons, experiments were carried out using a field gradient Watergate pulse sequence for water suppression (31). The spectra were recorded at 20 °C and 150 ms mixing time. These experiments were recorded with 1024 real data points in the d1 dimension and 2048 real data points in the d2 dimension. A relaxation delay of 2.0 s was used. TOCSY experiments were performed with mixing times of 90 and 150 ms, utilizing the MLEV17 sequence (32). The data in the d1 dimension were zero-filled to give a matrix of 1024 × 2048 real points. A sine-bell squared apodization with a 90° phase shift and a skew factor of 1.0 was used in both dimensions. Data were processed using FELIX (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA) on Octane workstations (Silicon Graphics, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Structural Refinement. Classical A-DNA and B-DNA were used as reference structures to create starting structures (33). The butadiene adduct was constructed using the BUILDER module of INSIGHT II (Accelrys, Inc.). The reference structures were energy-minimized by the conjugate gradients algorithm for 200 iterations without experimental restraints to give starting structures IniA and IniB used for subsequent relaxation matrix analysis and MD calculations. The program X-PLOR (34) was used for potential energy minimization. The CHARMM force field was utilized. NOESY cross-peak intensities were determined by volume integration. These were combined with intensities generated from complete relaxation matrix analysis of a starting DNA structure to generate a hybrid intensity matrix (35, 36) which

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 9, 2005 3329 was optimized using MARDIGRAS (37-39). Calculations run at correlation times of 2, 3, and 4 ns for both the sugar and base protons yielded 18 sets of distances. Average distances and standard deviations calculated from these data were used as bounds for distance restraints. These were divided into classes on the basis of confidence. Restrained Molecular Dynamics Calculations. The calculations were in vacuo. The electrostatic term used a reduced charge set of partial charges and a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4.0. The van der Waals term was approximated using the Lennard-Jones potential energy function. The effective energy function included distance and dihedral restraints, which were in the form of square-well potentials (40). Bond lengths involving hydrogen were fixed with the SHAKE algorithm (41). Random velocities fitting a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at 2500 K were assigned. Temperature was controlled by coupling to a bath with a coupling constant of 0.05 ps (42). Ten randomly seeded structures were calculated from each starting structure. Calculations were carried out for 3000 steps at 2500 K, then cooled to 300 K over 5000 steps, and continued at 300 K for an additional 15 000 steps. An initial force constant of 50.0 kcal mol-1 was used for class 1 distance restraints. Throughout the calculations, the force constants for classes 2, 3, 4, and 5 were set to 90, 80, 70, and 60%, respectively, of the value for class 1. The initial value of the force constant for the base pairing restraints was set at 50.0 kcal mol-1. The force constants were maintained at the initial value for the first 10 000 steps; class 1 force constants were increased to 200 kcal mol-1, and base pairing force constants were increased to 150 kcal mol-1 over the next 10 000 steps. The force constants were maintained for 17 000 steps, scaled down to 70 and 50 kcal mol-1 for class 1 and base pairing restraints, respectively, over 3000 steps and remained at these values for the final 10 000 steps. Structure coordinates were archived every 0.1 ps over the final 10 ps. Structure coordinates extracted from the final 4 ps were averaged and energy-minimized for 200 iterations using the conjugate gradients algorithm. Back-calculation of 1H NOE data was performed using CORMA (v. 4.0) (43). Helicodial parameters were examined using 3DNA (44). RESULTS Nonexchangeable Protons. An expansion of the NOESY spectrum showing cross-peaks between base aromatic and deoxyribose anomeric protons is shown in Figure 1. A significant observation was the weak C5 H1 to X6 H8 sequential NOE, followed by an intense X6 H8 to X6 H1 NOE. Simultaneously, the X6 H8 to X6 H3 NOE was unusually weak. This pattern was clearly observed when integrated volumes for these NOESY cross-peaks were plotted as a function of nucleotide position (Figure 2). In the complementary strand, a complete set of sequential NOE connectivities was observed. In contrast to the adducted strand, the intensities of all of the sequential NOEs were comparable. It was possible to completely and unequivocally assign all of the deoxyribose H2 H2, H3, and H4 protons from the NOESY data. A partial set of assignments was achieved for the deoxyribose H5 and H5 protons. The assignments are tabulated in Table S1 in Supporting Information.

Exchangeable Protons. A contour plot of the imino proton region of the NOESY spectrum, ranging from 12-15 ppm, is shown in Figure 3. The cross-peaks located in the imino region were well-resolved, with the exception of T14 and T16, which overlapped. Cross-peaks arising from the A7 H2 to T16 N3H and A9 H2 to T14 N3H NOEs confirmed that both T14 N3H and T16 N3H resonated at 13.6 ppm. The resonance arising from T17 N3H was not observed, and there was a subsequent break in sequential connectivity between T16 N3H and G18 N1H. The imino protons of the terminal C1,G22 pair and G11,C12 pairs were not detected, presumably due to fraying at the ends of the helices. Otherwise, a complete set of sequential connectivities was observed.

Butadiene Protons. Figure 4 shows the assignment of the butadiene protons from 1H NOESY data. The three butenyl protons,2 designated H, H, and H (Scheme 2), were observed between 5 and 6 ppm in the 1H spectrum. The resonance arising from H was observed at 5.79 ppm. The resonance at 5.25 ppm was assigned as arising from H because it exhibited a stronger NOE with H and with X6 H2 than did the resonance at 5.12 ppm, which was assigned as H. The H proton was assigned at 4.80 ppm. H also exhibited an NOE to X6 H2. It exhibited NOEs to two protons that resonated at 3.22 and 3.40 ppm, which were assigned as the enantiotopic hydroxymethyl HR,R protons. Their spectral assignments were based upon the predictions of potential energy minimization calculations that predicted that the lowest energy conformation of the S-N1-BD moiety placed the CR hydroxy group such that the hydroxyl proton was within hydrogen bonding distance of the inosine keto oxygen, X6 O6. In this conformation HR was expected to exhibit a stronger NOE to H and a weaker NOE to H, whereas HR was expected to exhibit only weak NOEs to H and H. Accordingly, the resonance at 3.40 ppm was assigned as HR and the resonance at 3.22 ppm was assigned as HR. NOE ConnectiVities between Butadiene and DNA. Figure 4 also summarizes the NOEs that were observed between the S-N1-BDO-(61,2) adduct and the oligodeoxynucleotide. NOEs were observed between the BD HR,R protons and C5 H5; the stronger NOE was BD HR f C5 H5. These NOEs established that the hydroxymethyl group of the S-N1-BDO(61,2) adduct was oriented in the 5 direction in the major

groove. A series of NOEs were observed between X6 H2 and all of the BD protons. The strongest NOE was observed between X6 H2 and BD H, with weaker NOEs to H , and H,. The latter two NOEs were undoubtedly a result of spin diffusion effects occurring at longer NOE mixing times. The NOEs between X6 H2 and the enantiotopic HR,R protons were weak, consistent with the predictions of potential energy minimization calculations that placed HR,R facing away from X6 H2. No NOEs were observed between S-N1-BDO-(61,2) adduct protons and protons in the complementary strand of the duplex. Chemical Shift Effects. As shown in Figure 5, only nucleotides C5, X6, and A7 in the modified strand showed significant chemical shift perturbations as compared to the unmodified ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide (28). These perturbations involved the deoxyribose H1 protons at all three nucleotides, and the imidazole proton X6 H8 at the adduct site, which shifted upfield 0.2 ppm. The largest chemical shift perturbation was a downfield shift on the order of 0.4 ppm, at C5 H1. The complementary strand showed only minor chemical shift perturbations. Restrained Molecular Dynamics Calculations. NOEderived distance restraints and empirical data were used to restrain a series of molecular dynamics calculations (Table 1). These rMD calculations employed a simulated annealing protocol. They incorporated 364 NOE-based distance restraints and an additional 90 pseudorotation and 62 empirical phosphodiester backbone angle measurements were also included. Two sets of calculations were completed. In the

first, no hydrogen bonding restraints were included at the modified X6,T17 base pair. In the second, an empirical hydrogen bonding restraint between X6 N7 and T17 N3H and was included. Both sets of calculations were initiated using both B-form DNA and A-form DNA starting structures, to ensure that the emergent structures were determined by the experimental restraints and were independent of the respective starting structures. In all instances, the calculations converged successfully to ensembles of similar structures, as indicated by pairwise rmsd comparisons, which were <1 Å, irrespective of A-form or B-form starting structure, or the presence or absence of an empirical hydrogen bonding interaction between X6 N7 and T17 N3H. Figure 6 shows a stereoview of an ensemble of structures that emerged from randomly seeded rMD calculations, which did not include a hydrogen bonding restraint between X6 N7 and T17 N3H. With the exception of the modified base pair X6,T17, the overall conformation of the oligodeoxynucleotide was more similar to B-form than A-form DNA. This was evidenced by a rmsd of 1.2 Å between the B-form starting structure and the average structure emergent from the rMD calculations, whereas the rmsd between the A-form starting structure and the average structure emergent from the rMD calculations was 6.9 Å. The accuracies of the structures emergent from both sets of rMD calculations were assessed by complete relaxation matrix calculations using the program CORMA (36). These calculations yielded a sixth root residual (R1x value) between the NOE intensities predicted by the refined structures and the experimentally measured NOE intensities. The complete relaxation calculations revealed good agreement with experimental NOE data only in the absence of a hydrogen bonding restraint between X6 N7 and T17 N3H. For the rMD

calculations that included this hydrogen bonding restraint, the agreement of the emergent structures with NOE data obtained at base pair X6,T17 was poor. Figure 7 shows R1x values as a function of position in the S-N1-BD oligodeoxynucleotide in the absence of a hydrogen bonding interaction between X6 N7 and T17 N3H. The sixth root residuals were consistently <0.10 at each nucleotide, indicating respectable agreement between the calculated NOE intensities and the experimental NOE intensities.

Refined Structure. Figure 8 shows a CPK model of the average structure emergent from the structural refinement protocol. The refined structure revealed that the S-N1-BDO(61,2) adduct existed in the high syn conformation about the glycosyl bond, with ) 106°. In this orientation, X6 and the BD moiety extended into the major groove of the DNA. The complementary nucleotide T17 remained stacked

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 9, 2005 3333 distortion. As shown in Figure 9, the refined structure suggested reduced purine-purine stacking between X6 and A7 in the modified strand, as compared to the corresponding stacking interaction between A6 and A7 in the unmodified ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide (28). The calculations predicted that rotation of X6 about the glycosyl bond placed the X6 H8 proton above the purine ring of A7, whereas X6 H2 now faced into the major groove. DISCUSSION Epidemiological studies have suggested that chronic human exposure to BD may induce genotoxic effects (11-13) and is correlated with increased risk for leukemia (1, 1422). This led to the classification of butadiene as "carcinogenic to humans by inhalation" (9), and as a "probable human carcinogen" (Group 2A) (10). Consequently, the elucidation of structure-activity relationships for adducts arising from the alkylation of DNA by butadiene mono- and diepoxides are of considerable interest. When B6C3F1 lacI transgenic mice were exposed to butadiene, it was observed that the adenine-specific point mutations were primarily A to T transversions (45-49). Significantly, however, A-to-G transitions were reported in H-ras codon 61 (50). The identification of the specific adenine adducts that may be responsible for these mutations represents a challenging problem. The oxidative metabolism of butadiene is complex and leads to several different electrophiles, each of which can alkylate multiple sites in DNA. Moreover, there exist multiple stereoisomers of each potential alkylation product. Here we focus on the initially formed product of cytochrome P450 oxidation, butadiene mono epoxide, BDO.

3334 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 9, 2005 Genotoxic Significance of N1-dA Adducts. Alkylation of the adenine N1 imine by BDO can occur at either carbon atom anchoring the oxirane; reaction at the internal carbon, C , results in the formation of stereoisomeric N1-(1-hydroxy3-buten-2-yl)-2-deoxyadenosine adducts (Scheme 1). These initially formed N1-dA adducts can subsequently undergo rearrangement to the corresponding N1 deoxyinosine adduct, or alternatively, Dimroth rearrangement to the corresponding N6-dA adducts (25, 51, 52). Consequently, it has not been possible to examine the initially formed S-N1-BDO-(61,2)dA adduct, either in terms of site-specific mutagenesis or structure. However, two Dimroth rearrangment products arising from alkylation of N1-dA by butadiene diol epoxide (BDE), the N6-dA butadiene triol (BDT) adducts, were examined, in the ras61 sequence. They were readily bypassed in Escherichia coli and were weakly mutagenic (53). Structural studies revealed that they oriented into the major groove, accompanied by modest structural perturbation, although interestingly, the observed structural perturbations were stereospecific (54, 55). The parallel mutagenesis and structural studies on the N6-dA BDT adducts suggested that to the extent that N1-dA alkylation products represent the source of dA-specific mutations in mice (45-49), either the N1-dA alkylation products themselves, or their inosine deamination products were likely to represent the more genotoxic species. Site-specific mutagenesis studies of this N1-(1-hydroxy3-buten-2-yl)-2-deoxyinosine adduct in the COS-7 system revealed that it was indeed highly mutagenic, and it yielded A-to-G mutations (26, 27). This led to the proposal (27) that deamination of initially formed N1 adducts of BD may represent the source of the H-ras specific A-to-G mutations observed in vivo (50). Indeed, deamination of dA yields dI and the latter would be expected to code for dCTP insertion during translesion replication. Nevertheless, the observation that the S-N1-BDO-(61,2) adduct coded for dCTP (26, 27) was somewhat unexpected, because the presence of the N1 adduct would preclude Watson-Crick type pairing between dCTP and dI in the template strand. It was proposed that perhaps instead the S-N1-BD inosine adduct promotes formation of a Hoogsteen-type pairing interaction with dCTP during trans lesion synthesis (27), thus resulting in the observed A-to-G transitions (50). Structural Analysis. The key feature of the S-N1-BDO(61,2) adduct structure was the rotation of the adducted deoxyinosine at X6 into the high syn conformation about the glycosyl bond, allowing accommodation of the S-N1-BDO(61,2) adduct within the major groove of the DNA. This conformational rearrangement placed X6 H8 toward the minor groove as opposed to its normal position in the major groove, the result being that the C5 H1 to X6 H8 NOE was abnormally weak. Simultaneously, the reorientation of X6 placed X6 H8 proximate to X6 H1, but further from X6 H3. This resulted in an exceptionally intense NOE cross-peak between X6 H8 and X6 H1 but a weaker than normal crosspeak between X6 H8 and X6 H3 (Figure 2). Subsequent rMD calculations revealed a distance between X6 H8 and X6 H1 < 3.0 Å. The high syn orientation of X6 also perturbed basebase stacking interactions between base pairs C5,G18, X6, T17, and X7,T16. The changes in these stacking interactions are qualitatively revealed by chemical shift perturbations at nucleotides C5, X6, and A7. As a consequence of the fact

Scholdberg et al. that X6 was in the high syn conformation, X6 H8 was stacked above A7 H8, consistent with the 0.2 ppm upfield shift observed for this proton as compared to the unmodified ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide (28). In the high syn conformation, the inosine base does not stack above X6 H2, as might be expected for the normal range of the syn conformation for the glycosyl torsion angle. In contrast to the modified strand, the complementary strand was relatively unperturbed by the presence of the S-N1-BDO-(61,2) adduct, as compared to the unmodified ras61 oligodeoxynucleotide (28). Potential energy minimization calculations predicted that the hydroxyl group at CR of the BD moiety should orient toward the inosine keto oxygen, X6 O6. This conclusion was supported by the relative magnitudes of NOEs between X6 H2 and the BD protons, and as well, between the various protons of the butadiene moiety. Formation of a hydrogen bond between the CR hydroxyl and X6 O6 resulted in a stable orientation for the S-N1-BDO-(61,2) adduct, consistent with spectral line shapes of the BD protons, which were similar to those arising from oligodeoxynucleotide protons, indicating the BD protons had relaxation properties similar to the protons of the larger oligodeoxynucleotide. In this orientation BD H was positioned in the same plane as X6 H2, consistent with the strong NOE observed between these two protons. This orientation also accounted for the distinct chemical shift environments of the enantiotopic HR,R protons. NOEs observed between HR,R and C5 H5 clearly positioned the hydroxymethyl group of the S-N1-BD adduct in the 5 direction with respect to X6. Watson-Crick base pairing was interrupted at the X6,T17 pair, due to reorientation of X6 into the high syn conformation about the glycosyl bond. Despite this, its complementary nucleotide T17 remained intrahelical. However, in the high syn conformation for the glycosyl bond, X6 was extruded into the major groove, leaving T17 exposed to solvent. Inspection of Figure 8 reveals that this structure results in formation of a solvent accessible "hole" in the duplex at the lesion site. This was consistent with the observation that the resonance arising from T17 N3H was not observable (Figure 3) presumably due to rapid exchange with solvent. The results of rMD calculations suggested that X6 N7 was not hydrogen bonded to T17 N3H. Thus, the intrahelical orientation of T17 appears to be the consequence of favorable free energy arising from its interaction with the more hydrophobic intrahelical environment. Structure-ActiVity Relationship. The present results suggest the N1-dI deamination products as a potential source of A f G transitions in H-ras codon 61 (50). The rotation of the S-N1-BDO-(61,2) adduct into the high syn conformation about the glycosyl bond potentially positions it to form a protonated Hoogsteen pairing interaction with incoming dCTP during translesion DNA replication, as had been previously proposed (26, 27) (Scheme 3). The location of the BD moiety in the major groove and distal to the Hoogsteen-binding face of the S-N1-BDO-(61,2) adduct suggests that a protonated Hoogsteen pair could form during lesion bypass. Thus, it will now be of interest to examine the S-N1-BDO-(61,2) adduct opposite dC in the complementary strand, to examine whether it does stabilize formation of a protonated Hoogsteen pairing interaction. Comparison with 1,N6-Ethenodeoxyadenosine Adducts. The exocyclic 1,N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine adduct, 1,N6- dA, provides an interesting comparison with the S-N1-BDO-

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 9, 2005 3335 SUMMARY When placed opposite T in duplex DNA, the deamination product of the N1-(1-hydroxy-3-buten-2(S)-yl)-2-deoxyadenosine adduct, N1-(1-hydroxy-3-buten-2(S)-yl)-2-deoxyinosine, exists in the high syn conformation about the glycosyl bond, with the glycosyl torsion angle in the range of 106°. The thymine complementary to the N1-modified deoxyinosine remains intrahelical. We propose that rotation of this adduct into the high syn conformation facilitates incorporation of dCTP during trans-lesion replication, thus generating A-to-G mutations, which have been observed sitespecific mutagenesis studies (26, 27).

(61,2) adduct studied in this work. In this exocyclic adduct N6 becomes a hydrogen bond acceptor rather than a hydrogen bond donor, similar to O6 in the S-N1-BDO-(61,2) deoxyinosine adduct. Site-specific mutagenesis studies using 1,N6dA were conducted in Escherichia coli (56), in COS-7 (57), and in human cells (56, 58). The mutagenic response differed somewhat in these systems. However, similar to the S-N1BDO-(61,2) dI adduct, in the COS-7 system, 1,N6- dA induced primarily A-to-G transitions (57), and the mutations observed in human cells also included A-to-G transitions (56, 58), suggesting a propensity for misincorporation of dCTP opposite the adduct. Rotation of 1,N6- dA into the syn conformation during trans-lesion replication would potentially allow it to pair with incoming protonated dCTP as we propose for the S-N1-BDO-(61,2) adduct or alternatively, with incoming dGTP (Scheme 3). The available structural data for the 1,N6- dA adduct suggest a complex interplay of factors controlling the interconversion of the exocyclic adduct between the syn and anti conformations about the glycosyl bond. When placed opposite thymidine in duplex DNA, the 1,N6- dA adduct differed from the S-N1-BDO-(61,2) deoxyinosine adducts it remained in the anti conformation about the glycosyl bond (59). However, in solution, an 1,N6- dA,dG mismatch was observed with 1,N6- dA in the syn conformation about the glycosyl bond (60), although this was not corroborated by crystallographic analysis (61). The 1,N6- dA,C mismatch has not been examined.
