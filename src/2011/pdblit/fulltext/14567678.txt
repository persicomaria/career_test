ABSTRACT: Memapsin 2 ( -secretase) is a membrane-associated aspartic protease that initiates the hydrolysis of -amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the production of amyloid- and the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Both memapsin 2 and APP are transported from the cell surface to endosomes where APP hydrolysis takes place. Thus, the intracellular transport mechanism of memapsin 2 is important for understanding the pathogenesis of AD. We have previously shown that the cytosolic domain of memapsin 2 contains an acid-cluster-dileucine (ACDL) motif that binds the VHS domain of GGA proteins (He et al. (2002) FEBS Lett. 524, 183-187). This mechanism is the presumed recognition step for the vesicular packaging of memapsin 2 for its transport to endosomes. The phosphorylation of a serine residue within the ACDL motif has been reported to regulate the recycling of memapsin 2 from early endosomes back to the cell surface. Here, we report a study on the memapsin 2/VHS domain interaction. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, the dissociation constant, Kd, values are 4.0 × 10-4, 4.1 × 10-4, and 3.1 × 10-4 M for VHS domains from GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3, respectively. With the serine residue replaced by phosphoserine, the Kd decreased about 10-, 4-, and 14-fold for the same three VHS domains. A crystal structure of the complex between memapsin 2 phosphoserine peptide and GGA1 VHS was solved at 2.6 Å resolution. The side chain of the phosphoserine group does not interact with the VHS domain but forms an ionic interaction with the side chain of the C-terminal lysine of the ligand peptide. Energy calculation of the binding of native and phosphorylated peptides to VHS domains suggests that this intrapeptide ionic bond in solution may reduce the change in binding entropy and thus increase binding affinity.

Memapsin 2 (1), also called BACE (2), ASP-2 (3, 4), and -secretase, is a protease that initiates the cleavage of the -amyloid precursor protein (APP).1 Proteolysis by memapsin 2 and another protease, -secretase, produces a 40- or 42residue peptide called amyloid- (A ). An excessive level of brain A leads ultimately to the death of neurons and the progression of Alzheimer's disease (5). To understand the involvement of memapsin 2 in the pathogenesis of AD, information on the cellular transport and activity of this protease is of great importance. Memapsin 2 is a type I membrane protein with a single transmembrane segment linking a luminal catalytic unit, homologous to other mammalian aspartic proteases (6), to a

C-terminal cytosolic tail (C-tail) of 21 residues. The newly synthesized pro-memapsin 2 is processed to mature protease by furin during transit through the secretory pathway to the cell surface (7-10). Memapsin 2 is active in an acidic medium up to pH 5 (1, 2, 11); thus, it is out of the pH range of its activity at the cell surface. Both APP and memapsin 2 at the cell surface are internalized to endosomes, the main site for APP cleavage by memapsin 2 and the production of A . The memapsin 2 protease is then recycled to the cell surface (10, 12). The structural signal required for the endocytosis of memapsin 2 was found to be a commonly used Leu-Leu motif present in the C-tail (10, 13). More recently, an aspartic acid and two leucine residues within a DISLL sequence in the memapsin 2 C-tail were shown to mediate the binding of memapsin 2 to the VHS (Vps-27, Hrs, and STAM) domains of GGA (Golgi-localized -earcontaining ARF binding) proteins (14). This memapsin 2 motif appears to be a form of the acidic-cluster-dileucine (ACDL) sorting signal DXXLL (X denotes a nonconserved residue) found in the cytosolic tails of mannose-6-phosphate receptors (MPRs; refs 15-17) and other lysosomal membrane proteins (17, 18). The binding of ACDL in these proteins to GGA VHS is responsible for the recruitment of these receptors to the coated vesicles on the trans-Golgi membrane for transporting to endosomes and ultimately to lysosomes (15-18). In the case of MPRs, this interaction

serves as the basis for targeting newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes. Therefore, GGA binding of the DISLL motif of memapsin 2 suggests that it is involved in the endocytosis and/or Golgi to endosome transport of memapsin 2 (14). Phosphorylation near the ACDL motif may enhance its interaction with GGAs. In cation-independent MPR (CIMPR), the phosphorylation, which occurs in vivo (19-21), takes place at the serine in the sequence of SDEDLL (22). The phosphorylated CI-MPR peptide produces a moderate increase in affinity toward GGA proteins (i.e., the Kd is lowered by 3-4-fold for CI-MPR (22)). The phosphorylation of the DISLL motif of memapsin 2, however, is at the serine residue within the motif. The mutation of this serine to an alanine altered the intracellular distribution of memapsin 2, suggesting that the phosphorylation plays a role in the transport of this protease (12, 13). The difference in position and consequences due to the phosphorylation of these two ACDL motifs argues that the phosphorylation regulates the trafficking of these proteins. In addition to the VHS domain, GGA proteins contain three other domains that interact with other proteins participating in vesicular transport, such as clathrin, AP-1, and Rabaptin5 proteins (23, 24). Crystal structures for the complex of unphosphorylated (25, 26) and phosphorylated (22) ACDL containing peptides from CIMPR with VHS domains of GGA1 and GGA3 have been determined. These structures confirm the important recognition roles of aspartic acid, dileucine, and phosphoserine in the ACDL motif. Molecular modeling for the binding of a DISLL-containing memapsin 2 peptide to the crystal structure of VHS from GGA2 revealed a very similar interaction to that of CI-MPR/VHS (27). To further understand the interaction of memapsin 2 ACDL motif with VHS, we determined the binding affinity of both phosphorylated and

nonphosphorylated peptides with VHS domains from all three GGAs and the crystal structure of a phosphorylated peptide complexed with GGA1 VHS. Our results suggest that all three GGAs interact with the memapsin 2 C-tail in a similar manner and that the phosphorylation enhances the interaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS cDNA Cloning and Protein Expression. The preparation of the fusion protein of glutathione-S-transferase(GST) and VHS/GGA1 or VHS/GGA2 has previously been described (14). For constructing VHS/GGA3 fusion, a fragment of GGA3 cDNA (GenBank accession number AF219138), corresponding to residues 1-157, was amplified from a human placenta long-insert cDNA library (Clontech), and the construction of its GST fusion protein, expression, and purification were the same as previously described (14). For crystallography and isothermal titration studies, recombinant GST-VHS/GGA1 was first purified through a glutathionesepharose 4B affinity column, and then the GST moiety was cleaved off with biotinilated thrombin (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). The digested sample was mixed with glutathionesepharose and centrifuged. The supernatant containing free VHS/GGA1 was further purified with Resource Q ionexchange chromatography (Amersham-Pharmacia), dialyzed against a buffer of 1 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4) and 0.1% (v/v) -mercaptoethanol, concentrated to 14 mg/mL (0.8 µM), and stored at -80 °C before use. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry. The nomenclature and sequences of the peptides derived from the cytosolic domain of memapsin 2 are listed in Table 1. The design and synthesis of these peptides are as described before (14). The phos-

The purified GST-VHS fusion proteins from three GGAs were dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and their concentrations were adjusted to 50 µM. The ligand peptides were dissolved in the same buffer to 1 mM. Isothermal calorimetric titrations were performed in a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA) at 30 °C. The peptide solutions were injected into the VHS solution (1.4 mL) or a blank buffer (i.e., without VHS) that served as a blank run to be subtracted from the experimental data. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd), entropy, and enthalpy were determined using the calorimetric analysis program ORIGIN (supplied by Microcal, Inc.). The experimentally determined stoichiometry for VHS of all three GGAs toward the peptide ligands was essentially 1:1 for all experiments. Cell Culture and Antibodies. The construct of hemaglutinin (HA)-tagged GGA1 was kindly provided by Dr. K. Nakayama (Kanazawa University, Japan). The constructs of GGA2-V5 and GGA3-V5 were amplified by PCR and inserted into plasmid pcDNA6.1 (Invitrogen). They were transiently transfected into HEK 293 cells using transfection reagent LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (GibcoBRL). Cells were collected and lysed on ice in PBS with 1% Nonidet P-40. Monoclonal mouse antibodies to hemagglutinin (HA) were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal mouse antibodies to the V5 tag were purchased from Invitrogen. Pull-Down Experiments. The peptides derived from memapsin 2 (M2-17, see Table 1 for sequence) and CI-MPR (CI-MPR-17) were covalently linked by their thiol groups to Sulfolink Coupling Gel (Pierce) using the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Cell lysates were prepared from HEK-293 cells transfected separately with HAGGA1 and GGA2-V5 and GGA3-V5 expression vectors. Cell lysates, each containing 200 µg of protein, were incubated with 100 µL of gel bearing immobilized peptide in 1.5 mL of PBS at room temperature for 2 h. The gel beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 750g for 1 min and washed three times with PBS. The proteins on the gel beads were eluted by sodium dodecyl sulfate(SDS)-containing sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) electrophoresis. GGA bands were identified by Western blot using monoclonal anti-HA or anti-V5 antibody. The negative control was the same as previously described (14). Crystallization. The initial crystallization condition was found with commercial crystallization screen kits (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA). Crystals used for data collection were grown at 20 °C from hanging drops under the following conditions. Freshly thawed protein solution was mixed 4:1 (v/v) with a solution of 20 mM peptide ADDISPLLK (SP, phosphoserine; see Figure 1). This solution was further mixed 2:1 (v/v) with the precipitant solution consisting of 30% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) MW 3350, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 6.4), and 0.1% (v/v) -mercaptoethanol. Crystals appeared in 1 day after microseeding and grew to full size (0.05 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm) in about one week. The same reservoir solution supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol was used as a cryo-

solution to soak the crystals before being cooled in a 100 K nitrogen gas stream for data collection. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement. A complete set of X-ray diffraction data was collected at 2.6 Å resolution from a MAR345 image-plate (Mar Research Inc. Norderstedt, Germany) and Rigaku X-ray generator (Molecular Structure Co., Woodlands, TX) equipped with an Osmic mirror system (Osmic Inc., Troy, MI). Data were processed with the program suite HKL (28). The crystal form belongs to the space group P21212. One asymmetric unit contains four VHS molecules with 51% solvent content (29). The solution for the crystal structure was determined using molecular replacement methods with the program AMoRe (30) and the crystal structure of VHS/GGA1 (PDB code 1JWF, ref 26) as a template. Model building was carried out with the program Turbo-Frodo (31). The VHS/GGA1 crystal structure was refined using simulated annealing with the program suite CNS (32) to a 0.235 R-factor with excellent geometry (Table 2). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Binding of Memapsin 2 Cytosolic Peptides to VHS Domains of GGA Proteins. The binding of a memapsin 2 peptide to the VHS domain of GGA1 and GGA3 had previously been shown (14). In Figure 1, we show that all three GGAs from cell lysates were pulled down by gelimmobilized memapsin 2 C-tail peptide. As in GGA1 and GGA3 (14), the CI-MPR peptide was more efficient in pulling down GGA2 than was the memapsin 2 peptide. We then determined, by using isothermal titration calorimetry, the dissociation constants for the binding of memapsin 2 cytosolic peptides (Table 1) to VHS domains of the three GGAs. The Kd value for the binding of a 17-residue memapsin 2 peptide, M2-17, to GGA2 VHS (2.87 × 10-4 M) is 27 times higher than that for the corresponding peptide from CI-MPR (1.07 × 10-5 M). The latter value agrees well with that reported for the binding of CI-MPR cytosolic peptide to GGA1 (0.79 × 10-5 M) and GGA3 (1.09 × 10-5 M) (22). The lower Kd for the CI-MPR peptide than that for

Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 42, 2003 12177 phosphorylation increased binding intensity to all three GGAs suggests that GGA proteins may be involved in memapsin 2 recycling. Crystal Structure of Memapsin 2 Phosphoserine Peptide Binding to VHS/GGA1. The crystal structure of the human GGA1 VHS domain (residues 2-157) complexed with the memapsin 2 phosphoserine peptide M2-8(S498SP) (Table 2) was determined at 2.6 Å resolution. The crystal was in a P21212 space group with four VHS molecules in an asymmetric unit, each bound to a ligand peptide. In the final refined structure, five to six residues at the N-terminus and up to 12 residues at the C-terminus of GGA1 VHS did not have interpretable electron density. However, these residues are not directly involved in ligand binding. The statistics of data collection and refinement are shown in Table 2. Coordinates of this VHS structure have been deposited to the Protein Databank (PDB code 1PY1). Structures of the four VHS/GGA1 molecules in the asymmetric unit were essentially identical to each other and were very similar to those previously reported GGA VHS domains (25-27). Each protein molecule contains a righthanded superhelix of eight helices (R1-R8) divided into two layers. The CR atom root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) between GGA1 VHS molecules ranged between 0.29 and 0.50 Å (residues 8-145). The four VHS molecules in an asymmetric unit formed two identical, symmetric dimers. This appears to be the prevalent form of VHS domain packing, as similar dimers have been observed (27) from crystals derived under different crystallization conditions. Molecular Interactions of Memapsin 2 Phosphoserine Peptide with GGA1 VHS. The eight-residue peptide cocrystallized with the VHS domain consists of a sequence of ADDISPLLK, which contains the VHS binding motif DISLL and where the phosphoserine (SP) is at the fifth position. In all four VHS-ligand complexes of the asymmetric unit, the phosphopeptide binds to the previously reported ACDL ligand binding site (Figure 2A) (i.e., between helices R6 (residues 89-98), R8 (residues 130-142), and the loop L6,7 (residues 98-107) (25, 26)). The N-terminal alanine residue is mobile in all four structures. The overall binding mode and the specific interactions of three essential residues were practically the same as those of MPR peptides binding to GGA1 (26) and GGA3 (22, 25). Briefly, the essential aspartic acid (D3 in Figure 2) interacts with three basic groups of GGA1 VHS, Lys87, Arg89, and Lys131. One of the essential Leu residues (L6 in Figure 2) is interacting with Phe88, Met 138, and Ile95, while the other (L7) interacts with Lys96 and Tyr102. For the non-motif residues, the free carboxyl at the C-terminal lysine (K8) interacts with three VHS residues, Lys101, Tyr102, and Gln142. From sequence alignment, the CIMPR cytoplasmic tail is one residue longer at the C-terminus than memapsin 2 (Table 1, see also the overlay of two peptide ligands in Figure 2B). The peptide carbonyl in CI-MPR corresponding to the memapsin 2 C-terminal carboxyl does interact with Lys101 and Tyr102 and somewhat weakly with Gln142. In the current structure, GGA1 VHS residues involved in ligand binding are conserved as previously pointed out by Shiba et al. (26). Memapsin 2 peptide side chains aspartic acid (D2) and isoleucine (I4) are devoid of significant interaction with VHS residues. This presumably contributes to the difference between the binding intensity of memapsin 2 and CI-MPR peptides to GGA1 VHS (see next). In the

the memapsin 2 peptide is consistent with the observation that the former is more efficient in pull-down experiments (Figure 1 and ref 14). We also confirmed the importance of the aspartic acid and dileucine in the motif of DISLL for binding to VHS. The replacement of the sequence IS in the motif (peptide M2-17(IS/AA)) or of the aspartic acid preceding the motif (peptide M2-17(D495A) by alanines did not significantly change the Kd value from that of the native peptide (Table 1). Single replacement of aspartic acid (peptide M2-17(D496A) or either leucine residues (peptides M2-17(L499A) and M2-17(L500A)), however, dramatically increased the Kd for VHS of GGA2 to above 10-3 M; thus, these values could not be accurately determined. We have also observed a similar high value of Kd for these last three peptides for binding to VHS from GGA1 and GGA2 (results not shown). We also found that the Kd value (42.1 × 10-5 M) for the binding of the C-terminal eight residues of memapsin 2 (peptide M2-8) to VHS/GGA2 is close to that for the longer peptide M2-17 (Table 1). This observation confirmed that the interaction of memapsin 2 C-tail rests essentially in the DISLL motif. The effect of phosphorylation of memapsin 2 Ser498 in the DISLL motif on VHS binding was studied. Phosphorylation of the octapeptide, M2-8, decreased the Kd by 10-fold for GGA1 (from 4 × 10-4 to 4 × 10-5 M), 4-fold for GGA2 (from 4 × 10-4 to 1 × 10-4 M), and 14-fold for GGA3 (from 3.1 × 10-4 to 2.2 × 10-5 M) (Table 1). As a comparison, the phosphorylation of the CI-MPR cytosolic peptide decreases the Kd of GGA1 and GGA2 binding by 4- and 3-fold, respectively (22). Walter et al. (12) have reported that phospho-Ser498 does not significantly alter the endocytic pathway of memapsin 2, rather it plays a role for recycling of this protease from early endosome via late endosome and/ or TGN to the cell surface. The current observation that the

current structure, the side chain of phosphoserine (SP5) protrudes into the solvent with a clearly defined electron density, even though its average B-factor was relatively high (75 Å2). The side chain of the C-terminal lysine residue was observed pointing to the phosphate group of the phosphoserine (see Figure 2). Comparing the Binding of Memapsin 2 and CI-MPR Cytosolic Peptides to VHS. GGA1 VHS binds CI-MPR peptide, CI-MPR-17, with about a 27-fold lower Kd value than the corresponding memapsin 2 peptide, M2-17 (Table 1), despite the close similarity in the bound conformation of the two ligands (Figure 2B). The structural difference that may account for the difference in binding intensity was sought by comparing crystal structures of GGA1 VHS complexed with M2-8(S498SP) (current structure) and CIMPR peptide (26). The interactions of three essential residues to VHS are almost identical in these two structures. However, differences were seen in the binding of nonessential residues. The C-terminal Ile in CI-MPR, which is surrounded by Ile94, Ser99, Met138, Gln142, and Ile144 in GGA1 VHS (PDB code 1JWG), is absent in memapsin 2. In addition, while the glutamic acid that follows the essential aspartic in CI-MPR has an ionic interaction with Arg89 of GGA1 VHS, the corresponding isoleucine in the memapsin 2 peptide is devoid of significant interaction. These differences in interaction appear sufficient to produce a 27-fold difference in Kd values. The difference in binding intensity between GGAs and various ACDL motifs has not been previously reported, and its biological consequence is not clear. The difference seems large enough to provide sorting specificity among intracellular trafficking pathways. Phosphorylation of the serine residue in the memapsin 2 peptide produced an enhanced binding to VHS of all three GGAs. The Kd values are 10, 4, and 14 times lower after the phosphorylation of the M2-8 peptide for GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3, respectively (Table 1). The binding intensity of

the phosphorylated memapsin 2 peptide approximates that of CI-MPR, especially for GGA3. The phosphorylation of the memapsin 2 C-tail is known to play a role in the recycling of this protease from the early endosomes back to the cell surface (12). The increased VHS binding of phosphorylated memapsin 2 suggests that GGAs may participate in this recycling process. In the case of CI-MPR, the phosphorylation of the serine (10th residue in peptide CI-MPR-17, see Table 1) resulted in new ionic interactions of the phosphate group with two basic side chains, Lys86 and Arg88, of GGA3 VHS (22). In the memapsin 2 peptide, the residue corresponding to the CI-MPR phosphoserine is an aspartic acid (second residue in the M2-8 peptide), which could form a similar ionic interaction but is nevertheless mobile (i.e., of higher B-factors) in the crystal structure. The new phosphate group in the memapsin 2 peptide is actually in an ionic interaction with the C-terminal lysine in the ligand itself (Figure 2). Since it is the only interaction in the memapsin 2 peptide/VHS structure not seen in the CI-MPR/VHS structure, this new interaction seems likely to comprise the structural basis for the significant increase in binding intensity with VHS domains after the phosphorylation of the memapsin 2 peptide (Table 1). A plausible explanation is summarized in Figure 3. The charge distribution of the memapsin 2 C-terminal peptide is such that it prefers an extended structure in solution (Figure 3, upper left). The phosphorylation of the serine residue (Figure 3, lower left) changes the charge distribution and results in a new preferred conformation (Figure 3, upper right) that permits the interaction of the new phosphate group with the C-terminal lysine and avoids two negatively charged aspartyl groups in close vicinity. In the preferred conformation, all three essential groups, an aspartic acid and two leucines, are located on the same side (Figure 3, lower right and Figure 2B) for efficient binding to the VHS domain. Such a mechanism is energetically favorable since it minimizes the entropy loss resulting from peptide

Memapsin 2 ( -Secretase) Cytosolic Domain

Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 42, 2003 12179 and the conformation it adopted would relieve the C-terminal lysine from the charge repulsion of these two groups. Of particular significance is the highest binding improvement of GGA3 VHS upon the phosphorylation of the memapsin 2 C-tail peptide. GGA3 is known to exist in two variants from differential splicing of its messenger RNA (18). The shorter form is missing part of the VHS domain and does not bind memapsin 2 peptides (data not shown). The longer form used in this study is predominantly expressed in the brain (33) where memapsin 2 is also expressed at a higher level than in most of the other organs (1). This correlation posts an intriguing possibility that the specificity of GGA function in memapsin 2 intracellular transport may be determined, in addition to the interaction studied here, by the tissue expression of GGAs.

FIGURE 3: Hypothetical mechanism for the observation that the phosphorylation of memapsin 2 cytosolic peptide enhances its binding to the VHS domain of GGAs. Memapsin 2 cytosolic octapeptide, which contains a VHS-recognition ACDL motif in the sequence of ADDISLLK (essential residues in bold), prefers an extended conformation in solution (upper left). The charge distribution is optimal in such a conformation (acidic residues, white balls with black bar; basic residue, black ball with white cross; neutral residues, white balls). The phosphorylation of the serine residue (arrow 1) resulted in a different charge distribution (lower left) and assuming a new preferred conformation (reaction 2) where phosphoserine (SP) is in an ionic interaction (dotted line) with the C-terminal lysine (upper right). Such a conformation places three essential residues (D, L, and L) on the same side of the peptide and thus facilitates its binding to VHS (arrow 3, lower right) by lowering the binding entropy.

binding to VHS. To test this hypothesis, we calculated the binding energies from the isothermal calorimetric studies of memapsin 2 native and phosphorylated peptides in Table 1. As shown in Table 3, the phosphorylation significantly reduced the entropy loss in both GGA1 (from -36.6 to -16 cal/mol, at 30 °C) and GGA3 (from -25 to +8.8 cal/mol, at 30 °C). The change of binding entropy due to phosphorylation is small in GGA2 (from -36.9 to -35.2 cal/mol, at 30 °C). This may be related to the unique conformational change of GGA2 VHS upon ligand binding (27), a phenomenon not seen for the VHS domains of GGA1 and GGA3, and could have reduced the entropic benefit of the phosphorylation. The conservation in the topology of the ACDLbinding residue among GGAs argues for the uniformity of this mechanism in the interaction of memapsin 2 and VHS domains. The charge distribution in the VHS domains may also contribute to the stability of the phosphoserine to lysine interaction in memapsin 2. In the crystal structure, the C-terminal lysine is located at the midway between VHS residues Lys101 and Lys141. The salt linkage to phosphoserine
