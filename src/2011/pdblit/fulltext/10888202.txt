Key words: rhodopsin; G-protein receptor; NMR; peptide; membrane protein Abstract: The intradiskal surface of the transmembrane protein, rhodopsin, consists of the amino terminal domain and three loops connecting six of the seven transmembrane helices. This surface corresponds to the extracellular surface of other G-protein receptors. Peptides that represent each of the extramembraneous domains on this surface (three loops and the amino terminus) were synthesized. These peptides also included residues which, based on a hydrophobic plot, could be expected to be part of the transmembrane helix. The structure of each of these peptides in solution was then determined using twodimensional 1H nuclear magnetic resonance. All peptide domains showed ordered structures in solution. The structures of each of the peptides from intradiskal loops of rhodopsin exhibited a turn in the central region of the peptide. The ends of the peptides show an unwinding of the transmembrane helices to form this turn. The amino terminal domain peptide exhibited a-helical regions with breaks and bends at proline residues. This region forms a compact domain. Together, the structures for the loop and amino terminus domains indicate that the intradiskal surface of rhodopsin is ordered. These data further suggest a structural motif for short loops in transmembrane proteins. The ordered structures of these loops, in the absence of the

Rhodopsin is one of the most extensively investigated members of the large family of G-protein coupled receptors. These receptors utilize heterotrimeric guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins to transduce extracellular signals to intracellular events. Rhodopsin is of wide interest both because of its status as the archetype of G-protein coupled receptors and because of the pivotal role it plays in visual signal transduction. Because these receptors are integral membrane proteins, crystallization for X-ray diffraction studies is dif®cult. Only a few integral membrane proteins of any kind have been crystallized in forms suitable for X-ray diffraction and structure determination (1±8). Lowresolution structural data have been published from twodimensional crystals of rhodopsin (9,10) but the intradiskal 456 |

surface and the cytoplasmic face that activates the G protein were not detected. Because hundreds of G-protein coupled receptors have been identi®ed regulating a wide variety of cellular functions, the need for three-dimensional structural information from this class of proteins is considerable. Direct structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been successful for soluble proteins and for peptides. However, integral membrane proteins are large and are not soluble in aqueous solution. Thus they are not amenable to this technique. Recent work on the largely helical protein, myohemerythrin, has suggested it is feasible

to elucidate protein structure by piecing together structural domains. It was shown that the protein structure could be divided into small structural domains. The structures of peptides that represent these domains exhibited the same secondary structure (as determined by NMR solution methods) as found in the structure of the intact protein (11). This study clearly suggests that secondary structures (helices and loops) are stabilized by short-range interactions. These principles can be applied to obtain the structural elements of a membrane protein. Rhodopsin is built around a bundle of seven transmembrane helices; the individual loops and carboxyl terminus and amino terminus of the protein constitute small domains, each of whose secondary structure is stabilized by short-range interactions and fully coded by the local primary sequence. The extramembraneous portions of rhodopsin act structurally and biologically as protein domains. The carboxyl terminal domain and the second and third cytoplasmic loops have biological activity, inhibiting the activation of the G protein, transducin, by light-activated rhodopsin (12,13). All three of these peptides, as well as the ®rst cytoplasmic loop from rhodopsin, form compact globular domains in solution as determined by circular dichroism and multidimensional NMR (14). The

cytoplasmic loop peptides form loops stabilized by a b-turn. The carboxyl terminal domain forms a more complex structure that also contains a-helix and b-sheet structures (15,16). Certain types of turns are stable as peptides in solution (17) and thus one might predict that the loops of rhodopsin would be stabilized by short-range interactions. Further work developed a structure for the entire cytoplasmic face of rhodopsin based on the structures of the peptides. This structure was consistent with all the available structural data obtained from the intact protein (18). We now extend these studies to the intradiskal face (corresponding to the extracellular face of other G-protein receptors) of rhodopsin. This face contains three loops and the amino terminus of rhodopsin. Peptides corresponding to these three loops and to the amino terminus were synthesized and their high-resolution structure determined by NMR in solution. All four peptides formed compact structures in solution. The three peptides corresponding to loop domains in rhodopsin formed loops as peptides in solution. Furthermore, the ends of these peptides could be observed to assume a helical motif. Presumably this represents an extension of the transmembrane helix. The amino terminus was mostly a-helix, but with several

All NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker (Billerica, MA, USA) AMX-600 spectrometer at 308C in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Standard pulse sequences and phase cycling were employed to record double quantum ®ltered chemical-shift correlated spectroscopy (DQF-COSY), and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) [data were collected with 150 ms, 250 ms, and 400 ms mixing times for all but intradiskal loop (IDL) 1, which was studied at a 300-ms mixing time only] (20). All spectra were accumulated in a phase-sensitive manner using time-proportional phase incrementation for quadrature detection in F1. The solubility of each of the peptides was tested in water. While all peptides were initially soluble in water, they aggregated during the time required for the NMR experiments. Aggregation was not observed in DMSO. Therefore all the data for the structure determinations were obtained in DMSO at 308C. Chemical shifts were referenced to internal water in the DMSO. Sequence-speci®c assignments were obtained using standard approaches and the results are listed in Tables 1±4.

employing felix (MSI, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). NOEs showed an increase in intensity as a function of mixing time. Owing to the small size of the peptides, optimal NOESY data sets were obtained at the longer mixing times. Owing to the small size of the peptides, no evidence for spin diffusion was observed. Assigned NOE cross-peaks from the data collected at a 400-ms mixing time were segmented using a statistical segmentation function and characterized as strong, medium or weak corresponding to upper bounds Ê distance range constraints of 2.7, 3.7 and 5.0 A, respectively. Lower bounds between nonbonded atoms were set to the Ê sum of their van der Waals radii (approximately 1.8 A). Pseudoatom corrections were added to interproton distance restraints where necessary (21). Distance geometry calculations were carried out using the program diana (22) within the sybyl 6.5 package (Tripos Software Inc., St Louis, MO, USA).

Similar structures were obtained from the NOESY data at 150-ms mixing time. Statistics on structures were obtained from X-plor. These calculations were performed on a Silicon Graphics (Mountain View, CA, USA) R10000 computer.

Results and Discussion
The seven transmembrane helical structure of rhodopsin has been well-established (9,10,23). The amino acid residues that constitute the helical domains, and the loop domains that connect the helices as well as the carboxyl and amino terminal domains, have been predicted using hydrophobicity plots (19). This has resulted in the amino acid assignments to these domains shown in Fig. 1. Based on these data, the structures of these loops remains unresolved.

rhodopsin were determined. The amino acid sequences of the peptides used were chosen to correspond to those amino acid sequences predicted to form the intradiskal loop domains and the amino terminal domain of rhodopsin. The intradiskal loops connect helices 2 and 3 (IDL 1), helices 4 and 5 (IDL 2) and helices 6 and 7 (IDL 3). The lengths of the peptides were chosen to be suf®ciently long to exhibit a well-de®ned structure, but short enough to maintain solubility. Previous observations in this laboratory have indicated that this requires peptides of approximately 15±45 residues. The sequences of the peptides are illustrated in Fig. 1. The sequences of these peptides are relatively hydrophobic. IDL 1 has 2 charged residues out of 32, IDL 2 has 6 charged residues out of 34, IDL 3 has 1 charged residue out of

26 and the amino terminus has 5 charged residues out of 40. Therefore it was not surprising to observe that these peptides were not stable in aqueous solution at the high concentrations required for NMR. It was preferable to avoid solvents like tri¯uoroethanol because of the potential of in¯uencing the secondary structure of the peptide. For these reasons, the peptide structures were determined in DMSO, which is not known to induce secondary structure like ahelix. In this solvent these peptides were stable in solution for the NMR experiments. One limitation of DMSO is that circular dichroism spectra could not be obtained from the peptides in this solvent, owing to its UV cutoff. The question then arises of whether the structure in DMSO can be expected to re¯ect the structure in the native protein. Recent experiments have addressed this question by

comparing the NMR-derived structures of synthesized peptides containing the sequence of three loops of bacteriorhodopsin with the crystal structure of the whole protein. Peptides were synthesized corresponding to the sequence of the CD, the DE, and the FG loop of bacteriorhodopsin, loops whose structures were de®ned in recent crystal structures of this protein (6,24). As in the case of the peptides in this study, these loops from bacteriorhodopsin were relatively hydrophobic and not stable in aqueous solution. The structures were therefore determined in DMSO. The resulting solution structures of all three peptides agreed

However, recent studies from this laboratory have shown that a high-resolution structure of the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin can be obtained by assembling the structures of peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic loops and the carboxy terminus (18).

(Yeagle et al., manuscript submitted). Therefore that region of the protein exhibited the same structure both in water and in DMSO. Furthermore, transmembrane segments of these proteins, which are known to be helical, show helices as peptides in DMSO (25). There is thus no currently available evidence of a problem with using DMSO for studies of hydrophobic peptide segments of bacteriorhodopsin or rhodopsin. The solution structure for each peptide was determined by standard homonuclear two-dimensional NMR protocols, as described in the Methods section. The number of constraints obtained from the NOESY maps are presented in Table 5. A limited number of constraints were available from the NOESY maps and the r.m.s.d. of the families of structures re¯ects that limitation. The connectivities are shown in Fig. 2A-D and the number of constraints per residue are given in Fig. 3A-D. Figure 4A-D shows the r.m.s.d. for each residue from the families of structures obtained from each of the peptides. As a representative example, the average main-chain pairwise r.m.s.d. over the whole molecule for the family of structures for IDL 1 is 1.5 before minimization and 1.6 after minimization. The structures of each of the peptides appear in Fig. 5A-D as an overlay of the structures obtained from simulated

The 32-residue peptide, IDL 1, which corresponds to the ®rst intradiskal loop, exhibits a de®ned structure as a free peptide in solution. The structure of this loop exhibits a helix-turn-helix motif. The short helices on each side of the turn are probably continuous with transmembrane helices 2 and 3 in the intact protein. This structure would suggest that transmembrane helix 2 extends to residue tyr102 and that transmembrane helix 3 starts about residue asn111 of rhodopsin. In the same manner, the 34-residue peptide, IDL 2, which corresponds to the second intradiskal loop, also shows a de®ned structure as a peptide in solution. The structure of this loop is another example of a helix-turn-helix motif. This structure suggests that in the whole protein, helix 4 would extend to pro180 and that helix 5 would start about tyr192. The folding of this loop de®nes a hydrophobic interior that is ®lled by the side chains of Trp175, Ile179, Ile189, and Tyr191. This hydrophobic pocket is likely to contribute to the stability of this structure (see Fig. 6). The 26-residue peptide, IDL 3, containing the sequence of the third intradiskal loop of bovine rhodopsin, also shows a de®ned structure in solution. This loop is largely hydro-

phobic in its amino acid content. Only one fully charged amino acid is present, Asp282. Asp282 is located at the bottom of the loop with the carboxylate group pointing away from the rest of the loop. Ser281 is in the adjacent position in the turn and also points away from the rest of the structure. Hydrophobic side-chains like those of Phe283 and Phe276 are not buried but point out from the loop structure. As these large hydrophobic side-chains are exposed, one would expect this peptide to be poorly soluble in water. A 16mer was also synthesized corresponding to a smaller portion of this same loop (rhodopsin residues 274±289, YIFTHQGSDFGPIFMT) and its solution structure was determined. This smaller peptide produced an ordered structure containing the same turn as that seen in IDL 3, but without the adjacent helices (data not shown). Additional residues of the rhodopsin sequence are apparently required to stabilize the structure of the helix in the helixturn-helix motif of IDL 3. It is important to note that while the 16-residue peptide was too small to exhibit the helices on either side of the turn, the turn itself was identical in both the 26mer and the 16mer. This is consistent with our earlier studies that showed that the structural elements exhibited by shorter peptides are retained when additional residues are added to the peptide. Thus, the peptides consistently re¯ect the structure of the larger unit (26). These data show that peptides containing the amino acid sequences of the three loops from the intradiskal face of rhodopsin form structures as individual peptides in solution. These structures are of modest de®nition owing to limitations on the number of constraints available from the NOESY maps. The helix-turn-helix motif was also observed for the loops from the cytoplasmic face of rhodopsin, as reported previously (27). Where the helices are observed in these loop peptides, they are probably extensions of the transmembrane helices of rhodopsin. Several factors are likely to contribute to the stabilization of these loop structures. Secondary structures such as turns and helices are stabilized by short-range interactions (17,28±30). These structures may be stabilized by the hydrogen bonds. As noted above, IDL 2 and IDL 3 are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. These data suggest that transmembrane helices 2 and 3 extend beyond the phospholipid bilayer and that the turn itself is quite small. The structure of the IDL 2 peptide suggests that the transmembrane helices 4 and 5 of rhodopsin also extend beyond the hydrophobic transmembrane region, again coding for a relatively small loop and longer transmembrane helices than expected. IDL 3 also shows a relatively small, mostly hydrophobic loop conJ. Peptide Res. 55, 2000 / 455±465

nected to helices that are likely to be continuous with the transmembrane helices 6 and 7. These data and the previously reported data for the cytoplasmic face (25) indicate that the seven transmembrane helices of rhodopsin extend beyond the hydrophobic membrane core. Furthermore, these transmembrane helices are connected by short loop structures. The short loops imply that consecutively numbered transmembrane helices must be adjacent to each other and close-packed in the intact structure of rhodopsin. This is in agreement with the proposed assignment of the transmembrane helices in the model of rhodopsin by Baldwin and Schertler (31). The structure of the 40-residue peptide that corresponds to the amino terminus forms a de®ned structure in solution. This structure consists mostly of a-helix, with breaks and bends in the a-helix at each of the ®ve prolines in the amino terminal peptide. With the bends introduced by the prolines, the amino terminal peptide adopts a compact structure. Trp35 is in the middle of this compact structure and the aromatic ring of this tryptophan is in a hydrophobic pocket in contact with methyl and methylene groups from several residues, including Thr17, Glu36, Val20, Ala26, and Pro34. This hydrophobic pocket is likely to contribute to the stability of the structure. At the carboxyl terminus of this peptide, a-helix is observed, which is probably continuous with transmembrane helix 1 of rhodopsin. The structure of the amino terminus offers some insight into the poor solubility of this portion of rhodopsin in water. Although the sequence contains several charged residues, some of these charged residues are involved in salt bridges with each

other. For example, Glu5 and Lys16 are in contact, and Arg21 and Glu25 are in contact. Interestingly, one of the prolines that introduces a signi®cant bend in the structure is Pro23. On each side of Pro23 is at least one turn of helix. The mutation P23H has been identi®ed as a mutation leading to retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The effect of replacement of this proline by a histidine can be predicted to lead to a joining of the helical segments on either side of Pro23. This would produce a longer helix, likely pointing in the direction de®ned by the helical segment downstream from Pro23. Therefore this RP mutation would be expected to change signi®cantly the compact structure of the amino terminus. In summary, the structural determination of the loop peptides indicates that the loops of rhodopsin are independently stabilized and that the helices extend out of the highly hydrophobic transmembrane region. In addition, the amino terminus of rhodopsin is also an independently stabilized domain of compact helical subdomains. These results are consistent with our earlier ®ndings on the cytoplasmic domains of rhodopsin and suggest that the helix-turn-helix motif may be a recurring structural element of membrane proteins. This work shows that some interesting information about a membrane protein can be obtained from the study of small domains.
