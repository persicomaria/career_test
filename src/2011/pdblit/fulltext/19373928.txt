ABSTRACT:
Recent studies have demonstrated that hemoglobins isolated from Antarctic fish undergo peculiar oxidation processes. Here we show, by combining crystallographic and spectroscopic data, that the oxidation pathway of Trematomus bernacchii hemoglobin (HbTb) is distinct from that observed for the major component of Trematomus newnesi (Hb1Tn), despite the high sequence identity of the two proteins and structural similarity of their ferrous and fully oxidized states. Resonance Raman analysis of HbTb autoxidation upon air-exposure reveals the absence of the oxidized pentacoordinated state that was observed for Hb1Tn. The

HbTb oxidation pathway is characterized by two ferric species: an aquo hexacoordinated high spin state and a bis-histidyl hexacoordinated low spin form, which appear in the early stages of the oxidation process. The high resolution structure of an intermediate along the ° oxidation pathway has been determined at 1.4 A resolution. The analysis of the electron density of the heme pocket shows, for both the a and the b iron, the coexistence of multiple binding states. In this partially oxidized form, HbTb exhibits significant deviations from the canonical R state both at the local and global level. The analysis of these modifications highlights the structural correlation between key functional regions of the protein. # 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Biopolymers 91: 1117­1125, 2009.

INTRODUCTION

T

etrameric hemoglobins (Hbs) are widespread proteins that are responsible for the oxygen transport in the blood of nearly all vertebrates. Although some basic features (oligomeric state, iron coordination, overall structural variation upon oxygenation) are preserved in all members of this family, a large number of studies have demonstrated that the properties of tetrameric Hbs are strongly influenced by adaptive evolution.1­5 In this context, fish Hbs are particularly attractive as they frequently exhibit specific features, mostly related to the peculiar dependence of their oxygen affinity on the pH (Root effect).6,7 In recent years, there has been increasing interest in Hbs isolated from fish living in the unusual environment of the Antarctic Ocean (AF-Hbs). Not only have these studies provided clues on the mechanism of Hb adaptation to these extreme conditions, but they have also been important for the elucidation of general properties of fish Hbs.8 In this scenario, it is worth noting that structural characterization of AF-Hbs in liganded or deoxygenated states9­14 have played a major role in the development of the current hypotheses on the structural bases of the Root effect.6,7,11,13,15 Studies on AF-Hbs have also demonstrated that they undergo a peculiar oxidation process.14,16­18 In contrast with mammalian Hbs, that essentially oxidize in their folded state to aquo/hydroxyl metHb forms, AF-Hbs oxidation leads to the formation of species such as bis-histidyl adducts16­18 and pentacoordinated states14,17­19 that are typically associated with Hbs with lower structural complexity (monomeric and dimeric).20­22 These analyses have also shown that changes of the heme iron binding and oxidation state are often linked to overall variations of their structure.18,22 Very recently, the spectroscopic and structural characterization of the intermediates along the oxidation pathway of the major Hb component of the Antarctic fish Trematomus newnesi has provided detailed information on the evolution of the protein oxidation when exposed to air.14 It was proposed that the starting aFe(II)(CO) bFe(II)(CO) form initially oxidizes to an aFe(II)(CO)bFe(III) (pentacoordinated) state, which eventually evolves to the final species aFe(III)(aquo-met)bFe(III)(bis-histidine), maintaining a tetrameric assembly throughout the entire autoxidation process. The crystal structure of the aFe(II)(CO)bFe(III)(pentacoordinated) state, which may be considered a half liganded form, also provided a detailed framework of the heme-heme communication path within the tetramer.14 Interestingly, the peculiar intermediate (pentacoordinated) and final (bis-histidine) states of the oxidation of AF-Hb were not observed in temperate fish Hbs, such as trout,23 and sea-bass.17 The major component of the Antarctic fish Trematomus bernacchii (HbTb) is a protein that is closely related to

Hb1Tn.9,24,25 Comparative analysis of their sequence shows that HbTb differs from Hb1Tn in only 14 residues: four in the a chain (Ala21Ser, Thr41Ile, His55Asn, Ala97Ser) and 10 in the b chain (Ile33Val, His41Tyr, Ala53Gly, Ile55Met, Gly56Ser, Val75Met, Ala83Asp, Thr84Ala, Ala86Thr, Val136Ala). Nevertheless, they present remarkable differences in their functional properties, only HbTb displays the Root effect.9,24,25 Preliminary mutagenic studies to induce the Root effect in Hb1Tn were inconclusive.25 To gain further insight into the peculiar oxidation process of AF-Hbs we have here characterized intermediate states formed by HbTb. The intrinsic complexity of tetrameric Hbs, which are made of two distinct chains whose binding and valence states rapidly evolve during oxidation, requires combined experimental approaches to accurately define the nature of the species involved.22 Indeed, although spectroscopic methodologies may effectively be used to detect the presence and the evolution of transient species, crystallographic structures may properly reveal distinct binding/oxidation states of the a and b iron within the tetramer. The characterization of the oxidation pathway of HbTb reported herein was carried out by following the evolution of air-exposed protein samples using UV-Vis and resonance Raman (RR) spectroscopy. The structural features of one of the intermediates along the oxidation pathway of HbTb were then determined at high resolution by X-ray crystallography. The combined analysis of these results provided a clear picture of the mechanism of HbTb auto-oxidation. Furthermore, comparison with the literature14,16­18,22 provided insights into analogies and differences among Hbs isolated from fish living in the unusual environment of the Antarctic Ocean. Since these AF-Hbs quickly oxidize, they are difficult to reduce and cannot function as active oxygen carriers for long periods. Moreover, Antarctic fish can survive even in sea water saturated with CO (that will saturate the Hb active sites),26 and Antarctic icefish can survive without Hb.27 Therefore, we are exploring alternative possible functions of AF-Hbs; experiments aimed at assessing and quantifying the superoxide dismutase activity of HbTb and Hb1Tn were also performed.

RESULTS
Auto-Oxidation of HbTb Upon Exposure to Air Followed by Resonance Raman and Electronic Absorption Spectroscopy
The oxidation pathway of HbTb, through air-exposure of protein solutions, was followed by resonance Raman (RR) and electronic absorption spectroscopy at 208C. These techniques are complementary to X-ray crystallography22,28­31

and are sensitive to the electron density of the macrocycle, the oxidation, coordination, and spin state of the iron atom.32 In analogy to Hb1Tn14 the autoxidation was started from the CO and not from the oxy or the deoxy forms, since carbomonoxy Hb is more stable toward oxidation. This guarantees a higher reproducibility of the autoxidation process. Indeed, the autoxidation time in AF-Hb is shorter than that of mammalian Hb, and even shorter than that of temperate fish Hb.17 The spectra of the carbonmonoxy form of HbTb upon air-exposure are reported in Figure 1. The spectra of the oxy and deoxy forms of HbTb are also shown for comparison. As expected, the high-frequency RR spectrum of the starting state (Figure 1C) is characterized by marker bands of the carbomonoxy form (e.g. m3 at 1501 cm21 and m2 at 1584 cm21). The band at 1470 cm21 (m3) and weak band at 1355 cm21 (m4) (data not shown) are due to the deoxy form produced by laser-induced photolysis of the CO ligand. It is noted that although the weak 1355 cm21 (deoxy) m4 band indicates a low level of photolysis, the corresponding m3 band at 1470 cm21 is strong and of similar intensity to the 1501 cm21 (CO form) m3 band. This apparently anomalous behavior of the m3 bands is due to the higher molar intensity of the 1470 cm21 band.33 In the RR low frequency region the band at 502 cm21, not present in the spectrum of the deoxy form, is assigned to the Fe-CO stretching mode (data not shown). The Met form, obtained by chemical oxidation, is included as a reference of the final form of the autoxidation. It is characterized by a (bis-histidine) hexacoordinate low spin (6cLS) (m3 at 1505 cm21 and m2 at 1579 cm21) and (aquo) hexacoordinate high spin (6cHS) (m3 at 1479 cm21 and m2 at 1562 cm21) state. The 6cLS state is assigned to a bis-histidine heme species as the Q0 (565 nm) and Q1 (530 nm) values observed in the UV-Vis spectrum of the Met form (Figure 1A) are typical of such a LS form.34 It is noteworthy that no pentacoordinate ferric form is apparent, in contrast with the previously reported case of Hb1Tn.14 During the early stages of air-exposure (3 hours), the weak charge transfer (CT1) band at 630 nm observed in the absorption spectrum (Figures 1A0 and 1B0 ) and the shoulder at 1479 cm21 in the RR spectrum are in consistent with the immediate appearance of a ferric aquo 6cHS species, whereas the growth of the RR band at 1638 cm21 (Figure 1C0 ) is assigned to the m10 of a 6cLS ferric species. The assignment of the 1638 cm21 band to the m10 of an oxy form can be excluded as the expected associated red shift of the Q bands and blue shift of the Soret in the UV-Vis spectrum are not observed. The lack of evidence for the appearance of an oxy species during the oxidation process contrasts with the behavior previously reported for HbTb17 and Hb1Tn.14
Biopolymers

Furthermore, this low persistence of the oxy form confirms that these Hbs cannot be considered as good oxygen carriers. In the present work, the autoxidation of HbTb was repeated a number of times, and only in one case the formation of an oxy species was observed. Hence, the results reported herein treat the apparently more general case for HbTb in which the oxy form is absent. No other significant differences in behavior were observed. Longer air exposure times (20­30 hours) are marked by the progressive growth of the CT1 band at 630 nm and downshift of the Soret to 409 nm. The growth of a Soret component at 407 nm is particularly clear in the second derivative presentation (Figure 1B), consistent with the increased presence of the 6cHS. Concomitantly, the Q bands blue shift to values similar to those of the bis-histidine 6cLS form observed in the Met species. Accordingly, the RR bands characteristic of the 6cHS (m3 at 1479 cm21 and m2 at 1562 cm21) increase in intensity and those of the 6cLS form become identical to the Met LS species (m3 at 1505 cm21 and m2 at 1579 cm21). Hence, the oxidation process shows a progressive concomitant increase of both 6cHS and 6cLS species and at no point in the time course is a 5cHS form observed. In addition, the intensity of the mFe-CO band at 502 cm21 decreases (data not shown). After 3­4 hours air exposure times, in all the UV-Vis spectra (Figures 1A0 and 1B0 ), a weak band at about 670 nm appears whose origin remains unclear. It is noted that in the final spectrum (27 hours) a significant proportion of the HbTbCO form is still present, as indicated by a Soret component at 418 nm in the second derivative absorption spectrum (Figure 1B), and by the 1470 cm21 band in the RR spectrum (Figure 1C), due to the m3 band of a deoxy form resulting from laser induced photolysis of the CO ligand. In general, the autoxidation process could not be followed after 27­30 hours as a consequence of protein degradation. This was marked by (i) an increase in fluorescence of the RR spectrum, (ii) an increased baseline in the UV-Vis spectrum resulting from significant light scattering, and (iii) reduced signal intensity, probably as a consequence of heme loss.

Crystallographic Analysis of an Intermediate Form Along the HbTb Oxidation Pathway: Overall Quality of the Structure
To obtain further information on the HbTb oxidation process, several crystallization trials were set up using samples of the carbonmonoxy derivative of the protein (HbTbCO) that were previously exposed to air for different time periods. To stop the progression of the oxidation process all trials were conducted in a CO atmosphere. Crystals of good quality were grown for HbTb exposed to air for five hours at 208C.

The intensities are normalized to that of the m4 band. The 460­700 nm region of the absorption spectra (A, B) is expanded fivefold. The absorption spectra (A0 , B0 ) are expanded 100-fold. The RR spectra (C0 ) are expanded twofold for the m3 and vinyl/m10 spectral regions. Biopolymers

presents a mixed binding state corresponding to a water molecule and a biatomic ligand. Taking the nature of the starting sample into account, the CO atmosphere of the crystallization process and the lack of oxy species in the spectroscopic analysis, the a-iron binding state can be confidently assigned as CO/aquo-met. This is also in line with the spectroscopic observation that ferrous and aquo-met species are simultaneously populated when the protein is exposed to air for a few hours. Both ligands with partial occupancy were considered in the refinement. The occupancy factor of the CO and the water molecule converged to 0.52 and 0.48, respectively. In contrast to the structural features observed in the achain, analysis of the b-heme pocket reveals significant variations of the local structure as a consequence of the oxidation process. The entire b-heme pocket shows a significant change in the mutual orientation of helices E and F, when compared with the structure of HbTbCO. Indeed, the local structure

° These crystals that diffract at 1.4 A resolution, with very good processing statistics (Table I), are isomorphous to those of HbTbCO.9 Therefore, the structural variations exhibited by partially oxidized HbTb, compared with the starting carbonmonoxy form,9 are representative of the intrinsic conformational properties of the protein and are not generated by differences in the crystal packing. The electron density maps of the refined model, with the exception of a few solvent-exposed side chains, are well defined for the entire protein structure. Interestingly, also regions corresponding to the C terminus and to the CD segment of the b chain, which are generally disordered in R-state protein structures,9,12 display interpretable maps.

Structure of the Heme Pocket Regions
The inspection of the electron density maps of the a-heme region indicates that all residues of the pocket assume the conformation typically observed in the canonical R state. Indeed, both the proximal and the distal sides of heme closely resemble those observed in HbTbCO.9 A strong electrondensity peak is located at the sixth coordination position of the iron (Figure 2A). The size of the peak is large enough to accommodate a biatomic ligand. However, closer inspection of the density at different levels suggests that the a iron

becomes more compact, with the distance between the proxi° mal and distal His Ca atoms decreasing from 14.4 A (the ° . The analysis of the value observed in HbTbCO) to 13.4 A electron density of the heme environment indicates that distal histidine (His63b) adopts two distinct conformations (Figure 2B). The first rotamer (side-chain dihedral angle v1 5 1628 and v2 5 21238) is nearly coincident to that observed in canonical hexacoordinated states, whereas the other one (v1 5 21578 and v2 5 21238) assumes an unusual conformation, as it protrudes toward the solvent. The refinement of the structure carried out by adopting two distinct conformations for this His leads to occupancy factors of 0.48 and 0.52 for the canonical conformation and for the external rotamer, respectively. The electron density at the sixth coordination position of the iron atom clearly indicates the presence of an exogenous ligand. As for the a-iron, the electron density has been interpreted as the result of a mixed binding state. However, the quality of the electron density of the region suggested a more complicated situation. Most of the electron-density present in the site can be ascribed to a CO ligand with partial occupancy (occupancy factor 0.53). Interestingly, the compression of the local structure of the pocket makes the presence of CO in the sixth coordination position incompatible with the canonical positioning of distal His63b. Therefore, the presence of the CO ligand has been correlated to the conformation of distal histidine that swings out of the heme pocket (see Figure 2B). On the other hand, the definition of the heme binding state when His63b adopts its canonical rotameric state is not straightforward. The shape of electron-density map suggests that multiple forms are present. Indeed, deoxy, aquo-met, and bis-histidyl species may be simultaneously present at the b heme when His63b is located inside the pocket. The presence of a significant amount of the deoxy form may be related to the compression of the EFb pocket that may favor the CO release. In conclusion, the high-resolution crystal structure of this intermediate along the oxidation pathway indicates that a- and b iron display mixed binding states. This partially oxidized structure will be hereafter denoted as HbTb[Fe(II),Fe(III)].

Tertiary and Quaternary Structure Variations Induced by Partial Oxidation
The local alterations of the heme structure observed upon oxidation propagate beyond the heme pocket producing changes at the tertiary and quaternary structure level. One of the most striking differences between the structure of HbTb[Fe(II),Fe(III)] and the structure of HbTbCO is detected for the CDb region. This part of the molecule, completely disordered in HbTbCO and in several other R-state

tetrameric Hbs, becomes ordered in HbTb[Fe(II),Fe(III)]. Intriguingly, the structure of the CDb is strongly influenced by the conformation adopted by His63b. Indeed, CDb adopts two conformations in the region 43­47. The rotamer of His that protrudes outside of the heme pocket is able to induce a conformational change of the Phe45b side chain, which is associated with a concomitant peptide-bond flip of the main chain between Phe45b and Gly46b (see Figure 3). The modifications of the CDb regions are transmitted to the a1b2 interface. Arg40b changes its conformation compared with the CO form, positioning itself between the side chains of residues His41b and Tyr42a. The movement of Arg40b is associated with a displacement of Arg93a, which covers the cavity usually occupied by Arg40b in Hbs. The oxidation also produces the peculiar interaction, already found in fully oxidized HbTb, of the terminal His residues of the two b chains within the tetramer. As a consequence of these changes, as observed in Hb1Tna(CO)b(penta),14 the overall quaternary structure of HbTb[Fe(II),Fe(III)] departs from the canonical R-state, and is intermediate between the canonical R and T states. Indeed, the step-wise superimposition of ab dimers suggests that the optimal fit of a2b2 of HbTb[Fe(II),Fe(III)] and HbTbCO, starting from the overlapped a1b1 dimers, requires a rotation of about 58; whereas the optimal fit of a2b2 of HbTb[Fe(II), Fe(III)] and HbTb(deoxy)13 requires a rotation of about 78.

Fe-Superoxide Dismutase Activity
The experimental detection of valence hybrid states in Hb1Tn when air-exposed14 and, on the basis of the present data potentially also in HbTb, suggest that these proteins have a possible

SOD activity. Under the indicated conditions, the SOD activity of Lumbricus Hb was 4.6 U/mg as determined by the xanthine oxidase-cytochrome c method.35 The SOD activity of Hb1Tn and HbTb is of the same level as HbA or Hb from Lumbricus terrestris,36 about 10% of that of Cu,ZnSOD.

DISCUSSION
The characterization of protein intermediate states that play a role in biological processes is one of the major goals of modern structural biology. Here we report a combined spectroscopic and crystallographic analysis of the peculiar oxidation process of HbTb. The present data show that the evolution of HbTb when exposed to air differs significantly from that observed in the closely related protein Hb1Tn.14 In particular, HbTb displays a smaller repertoire of oxidation states. Indeed, the formation of the fully oxidized form of HbTb [a(aquo-met) and b(bis-histidine)] is not preceded by the pentacoordinated state detected for Hb1Tn. We also determined the high-resolution structure of an intermediate species along the oxidation pathway HbTb[Fe(II),Fe(III)]. The electron density of both heme pockets suggests the presence of mixed binding states. Although these findings may somewhat depend on the HbTb form selected during the crystallization process, they do not fit with the sequential oxidation process observed for Hb1Tn,14 which suggests that the oxidation of the a-iron precedes that of the b-iron. By analogy with Hb1Tn,14 that has high sequence homology with HbTb differing in only 14 residues, even partial oxidation of the protein induces significant variations of the overall protein structure. The global modifications of both proteins lead to formation of a structural state that is intermediate between the functional T and R states. A comparison of HbTb and HbTn partially oxidized states suggests that the two proteins undergo similar global transitions despite the different iron binding states. Indeed, the root mean square deviations computed on the ordered Ca atoms of the a chain, of the b chain, and of the whole tetramer are 0.14, ° 0.29, and 0.44 A, respectively. It is worth noting that the comparison of HbTb in its partially oxidized state with the starting HbTbCO form yields significantly higher root mean square deviation (RMSD) values (0.66, 0.64, and 1.31 for the a chain, for the b chain, and for the entire tetramer, respectively). Nevertheless, the local structure of specific regions of the partially oxidized species of Hb1Tn and HbTb show significant differences. The root mean square deviation ° ° (RMSD) in individual chains is 0.14 A and 1.54 A for a and b chains respectively, and the RMSD on the whole tetramer ° is 1.11 A. In HbTb, particularly notable is the disorder-order transition of the CDb region that is completely unstructured

in HbTbCO,9 but which becomes ordered in the partially oxidized form HbTb[Fe(II),Fe(III)]. It is important to note that this region becomes again disordered in the fully oxidized state of HbTb.18 This region is also disordered in the carbonmonoxy,12 partially oxidized,14 and fully oxidized forms of Hb1Tn.16 In HbTb, a major role in the stabilization of this versatile region is played by the conformation adopted by the distal His63b (Figures 3 and 4). Indeed, in one of its two possible rotameric states, His63b directly interacts with Phe45b that, in turn, influences the structure of the whole CDb region. These findings provide clear evidence of the structural link between the distal side of the heme pocket and the CDb region, whose conformational versatility is fully exploited also in the functional Hb transition from liganded R to deoxy T states. Further differences between the Cb terminus of HbTb and Hb1Tn within this intermediate R/T quaternary structure can be pH dependent, and thus be related to the Root effect interpretation. These differences were already observed at the level of the fully oxidized states of HbTb and Hb1Tn.16,18 An interpretation of the effect of this different b1b2 interface in the context of the Root effect requires the availability of deoxy and carbomonoxy structures of HbTb and Hb1Tn entirely in the ferrous state. The occurrence in Hb1Tn14 and presumably in HbTb of species with valence hybrid states (Fe (II)­Fe (III)) prompted us to evaluate the possibility that these proteins could be endowed with a superoxide dismutase activity (SOD). Under our experimental conditions, the two proteins exhibit rather low SOD activity, comparable to that shown by human Hb. Although the low level of SOD activity does not provide convincing support for the hypothesis that HbTb/Hb1Tn may

play such a role in a biological context, the detection of unusual oxidized states in these proteins still raises the possibility that they may also be involved in physiological processes distinct from oxygen transport. Experiments to evaluate other possible functions are in progress. In conclusion, the characterization of the oxidation pathway of closely related AF-Hbs shows significant differences. It is particularly interesting that HbTb and Hb1Tn, which share very high sequence homology9,24 and, more importantly, very similar ferrous and fully oxidized states, display different intermediate coordination states. Nevertheless, the close similarity of the end states of the oxidation process does not preclude differences in the intermediate states. In this regard, functional differences between the two proteins (Root effect) may not be necessarily ascribed to the final states of the functional R/T transition, but they may depend on different subtle differences in the properties of the intermediate states.

Sample Preparation for Spectroscopy Experiments
The HbTbCO used in the autoxidation process was prepared by exposing the ferrous form to CO in sealed Raman cells. For comparative purposes, also the deoxy, the oxy, and the fully oxidized forms of the protein were prepared. In particular, the oxidized Met-Hb derivatives were prepared by treating the protein with an excess of potassium hexacyanoferrate (III). Gel filtration of the protein on a Biogel P-6DG column equilibrated with Tris-HCl pH 7.5 was then performed to remove the oxidant. The deoxy samples were prepared by adding 2­3 mL of sodium dithionite (20 mg/mL) to 50 mL of deoxygenated buffered solution of Met-Hb. The oxy sample was prepared by gel filtration of a deoxy sample on a Biogel P-6DG column equilibrated with Tris-HCl pH 7.5.

Spectroscopy
The autoxidation of HbTbCO in solution was followed by resonance Raman and electronic absorption spectroscopy by exposing the protein solution to air at 208C. The RR and UV-Vis experiments were carried out on protein samples in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 placed in 5-mm NMR tubes. Electronic absorption spectra were measured with a double-beam Cary 5 spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). The RR spectra were obtained by excitation with the 413.1 nm line of a Kr1 laser (Coherent, Innova 300 C, Santa Clara, CA). Backscattered light from a slowly rotating NMR tube was collected and focused into a triple spectrometer (consisting of two Acton Research SpectraPro 2300i and a SpectraPro 2500i in the final stage with a 3600 grooves/mm grating) working in the subtractive mode, equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled CCD detector. It should be noted that the spectral resolution of the RR spectra cited in the figure captions is that calculated theoretically on the basis of the optical properties of the spectrometer. However, for the moderately broad experimental RR bands observed in the present study (ca. 10 cm21), the effective spectral resolution will in general be lower. The RR spectra were calibrated with indene, dimethyl sulfoxide, pyridine, and CCl4 as standards to an accuracy of 61 cm21 for intense isolated bands.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Crystallization and Data Collection
The carbonmonoxy derivative of HbTb was prepared as previously described.9 HbTbCO was used as the initial form for the air-induced oxidation. The form characterized in the present investigation was obtained by exposing HbTbCO to air for 5 hours at 208C. To prevent any further oxidation, crystallization experiments were carried out, using free-liquid diffusion techniques, by mixing the protein with precipitating agents and buffers in a sealed capillary under CO atmosphere at 208C. The crystallization trials were conducted by optimizing the conditions used to crystallize the partial bis-histidyl complex of HbTb (HbTbBis).18 Crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis grew in 1 week by using a protein concentration of 6 mg/mL and 14% w/v MPEG5000 in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). Diffraction data used in the structural analysis were obtained at 100 K at the ID14-1 beam-line of ESRF (Grenoble, France), using 18% v/v ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were processed using the program suite Denzo and Scalepack.37 A summary of the indicators commonly used to estimate the quality of datasets is given in Table I.

Superoxide Dismutase Activity
SOD activity of HbTb, Hb1Tn, and human Hb (as a control) was measured following the previously reported procedure.29 Xanthine and ferricytochrome c (horse heart) were from Sigma. Assays were performed by the xanthine oxidase method with cytochrome c, in 50 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.8 and 0.1 mM EDTA. The authors thank the ESRF Synchrotron (Grenoble, France) for beam-time and the staff of the beam-line ID14-1 for assistance during data collection. Dr. A. Riccio, G. Sorrentino, and M. Amendola are also acknowledged. Finally, The authors thank Prof. L. Mazzarella for his careful and enthusiastic scientific guidance in research on fish hemoglobins.

Structure Refinement
The structure of HbTb in the early stages of autoxidation was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe38 and the structure of HbTb18 (Protein Data Bank code 2PEG) as starting model. ° The structure was refined using the program XPLOR at 1.40 A resolution. Each refinement run was followed by manual intervention using the molecular graphic program O.39 The final model of HbTb[Fe(II),Fe(III)] has been refined to an Rfactor value of 0.184 (Rfree 0.214). The stereochemistry of the final model, checked using the program PROCHECK,40 is in line with that exhibited by protein structures refined at high resolution. The atomic coordinates of HbTb[Fe(II),Fe(III)] have been deposited in the PDB (code 3GKV).
