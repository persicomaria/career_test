(Received 14 December 1982, and in revised form 24 May 1983)
The three-dimensional structures of cro repressor protein and of the amino-terminal domain of A repressor protein, both from bacteriophage A, are compared. The second and third a-helices, a2 and ~3, are shown to have essentially identical conformations in the two proteins, confirming the significance of the amino acid sequence homology previously noted between these and other DNA binding proteins in the region corresponding to these helices. The correspondence between the two-helical units in cro and ~ repressor protein is better than the striking agreement noted previously between two-helical units in cro and catabolite geneactivator protein. Parts of the first a-helices of repressor and cro show a structural correspondence that suggests a revised sequence homology between the two proteins in their extreme amino-terminal regions. In particular, there is a short loop between the a I and a2 helices of A repressor that is missing from cro. This structural difference may account for the observed differences found with different cros and repressors in the pattern of phosphates whose ethylation prevents the binding of these proteins to their specific recognition sites. Although the two proteins have strikingly similar a2-~3 helical units that are presumed to bind to DNA in an essentially similar manner, stereochemical restrictions prevent the a2-aa units of the respective proteins aligning on the DNA in exactly the same way.

style of bacteriophage A (for reviews, see Ptashne el al., 1980; Johnson et al., 1981 ; Ohlendorf & Matthews, 1983). Both proteins bind to six I7-base-pair sites on the phage genome although they have different site preferences. Cro repressor protein (cro), the product of the cro gene, is a small polypeptide of 66 amino acids, dimeric in solution, that binds non-co-operatively to adjacent operator sites (Folkmanis et al., 1976; Takeda et al., 1977; Takeda, 1979; Hsiang et al., 1977; Roberts et al., 1977). ~ repressor protein (~ repressor; also referred to as cI), the product of the cI gene, is a larger polypeptide of 236 amino acids (Sauer & Anderegg, 1978) that folds into two distinct domains (Pabo et al., 1979). The amino-terminal domain (residues 1 to 92) is responsible for DNA binding (Sauer etal., 1979), while the carboxy-terminal domain contains the most important contacts for dimer formation and is responsible for co-operative binding to DNA (Pabo et al., 1979; Johnson el al., 1979). The structures of cro and of the DNA-binding domain of ~ mpressor have been determined and models have been proposed for the interaction of the respective proteins with DNA (Anderson et al., 1981 ; Pabo & Lewis, 1982 ; Pabo et al., 1982 ; Ohlendorf et al., 1982; Matthews et al., 1983; Lewis et al., 1983). The respective models for DNA binding are similar but not identical. It has been shown that there ate amino acid sequence homologies between a number of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, including cro and 2 repressor, suggesting that the modes of site-specific recognition used by cro and ~ repressor may be representative of many DNA-binding proteins (Anderson et al., 1982; Matthews et al., 1982; Sauer et al., 1982; Ohlendorf et al., 1983). There is also a striking structural correspondence between ~-helical segments in the presumed DNA-binding regions of cro and catabolite gene-activator protein (Steitz et al., 1982). In this paper we compare the structures of A repressor and cro and re-evaluate the amino acid sequence homology of these and other DNA-binding proteins in the light of the structural comparison. We discuss the implications of the structure and sequence comparisons for the interaction of these proteins with DNA. 2. Overall Comparison of Cro and 2 Repressor The polypeptide backbones of monomers of cro and the DNA-binding domain of A repressor were first compared by the procedure of Remington & Matthews (1978,1980). Comparison with a probe length of 20 residues (Fig. 1) showed that the only region of uninterrupted structural homology between the two proteins is in the region of their respective second and third helices, i.e. a superposition of the ~2-a3 units. The best 20-residue correspondence is between residues 17 to 36 of cro and 34 to 53 of A repressor, with a ro0t-mean-square discrepancy of 0"68 A, which is clearly significant (3"5 standard deviations better than the average value). The proteins were also compared by the procedure of Rossmann & Argos (1976,1977), which attempts to overlap or "equivalence" as many a-carbons as possible within the respective polypeptides, allowing appropriate "insertions" or "deletions". This comparison shows that 36 a-carbons can be regarded as equivalent (Table 1 ), with a root-mean-square discrepancy of 3"1 A. The alignment of the equivalent

In the Rossmann-Argos (1976,1977) procedure, "equivalent" residues are required to be spatially close together when one protein is superimposed on the other and, in addition, to be within polypeptide segments t h a t run in approximately the same direction in the superimposed structures. The separations given in the Table are between the a-carbons of the equivalent residues.

As can be seen in Figures 1 to 4 and Table l, the structural agreement is very good within the second and third helices (a2-~3) of the two molecules. There is also an apparent correspondence between parts of the respective al helices. The third region of equivalence, beginning at residue 40 of cro, has poor structural agreement (Table 1) and corresponds to an approximate spatial overlap of the beginning of the ~4 helix of A repressor and the f12 strand of cro.
3. C o m p a r i s o n o f the a2-a 3 Bihelical U n i t

The ~2-~3 bihelieal unit has previously been shown to occur, and to have a very similar conformation, in cro and in catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) from Escherichia coli (Steitz et al., 1982). Also, for cro, CAP and A repressor the bihelical unit has been proposed to play a major role in DNA recognition and binding. In each case the second helix of this unit (~3 for cro and A repressor; ~F for CAP) is presumed to bind within the major groove of B-form DNA (Anderson et al., 1981 ; Pabo & Lewis, 1982; Ohlendorf et al., 1982; Lewis et al., 1983).

CAP, binding to left-handed DNA (McKay & Steitz, 1981 ; Steitz et al., 1983) and to right-handed B-form DNA (Pabo & Lewis, 1982) have been proposed. Because of the apparent special role of the a2-a 3 bihelical units in DNA recognition, we compared their structures in more detail. It was shown previously that the 24 consecutive a-carbon atoms 13 to 36 of cro and 166 to 189 of CAP superimpose with an r.m.s.t error of l'l A (Steitz et al., 1982). This correspondence was better, by a factor of almost 3, than the correspondence of the bihelical unit with any other 24-residue segment of any other protein in the Brookhaven Data Bank. For cro and A repressor, residues 13 to 36 and 30 to 53 superimpose with an r.m.s, error of 1"04 A, i.e. just as good as the cro-CAP correspondence. In the case of cro and ~ repressor the agreement for the 23 a-carbons 14 to 36 (Cro) and 31 to 53 ()l-repressor) (i.e. deleting the first a-carbon) is 0"7 A, which is close to the limit set by the accuracy of the respective coordinates. The fact that the a2-~3 bihelical unit is found in no other protein, yet is conserved so precisely in cro, CAP and A repressor, strongly supports the idea that this helical super-secondary structure has a special role in DNA : protein binding.

4. Comparison of the Dimers of Cro a n d 2 Repressor Both cro and A repressor are thought to bind to DNA as dimers, and in the crystal structures the proteins are seen to associate about local 2-fold axes of symmetIs~. The respective modes of association, viewed along the dyad symmetry axes, are sketched in Figure5. For cro, the protein packs in a tetrameric arrangement about three mutually perpendicular 2-fold axes. The association shown in Figure 5 is believed to exist in solution (Anderson et al., 1981). For repressor, the isolated N-terminal domains do not readily associate in solution but dimerize as they bind to operator DNA (Pabo et al., 1979; Pabo, 1980). In the crystals, the N-terminal domains form dimers that are thought to be the operator binding species (Pabo & Lewis, 1982). Recent evidence in support of this assertion comes from a mutant ~ repressor in which Ile84 is replaced by Ser. This substitution inactivates the protein, apparently by perturbing the hydrophobic

dimer contact between the two as helices (Fig. 5) (Nelson el al., 1983 ; H e c h t et al., 1983). For cro, tile centers of the 2-fold-related ~3 helices are 34 A apart. The helices lie within a plane and are tilted in such a w a y t h a t they can be placed directly within successive m a j o r grooves of W a t s o n - C r i c k B-form D N A (Anderson et al., 1981). For A repressor a similar, although not identical, interaction has been proposed. I n this case the a3 helices are also 34 A a p a r t b u t are not coplanar. In addition they are less tilted t h a n is the case with cro (Fig. 5). Model building e x p e r i m e n t s suggest t h a t tile N-terminal p a r t s of the a3 helices, rather t h a n the helices as a whole, bind within the m a j o r grooves of the D N A (Pabo & Lewis, 1982). In comparing the cro and A repressor dimers we first a t t e m p t e d to simultaneously superimpose the a2-a3 units of the two dimers. The difference noted a b o v e in the relative alignment of these units in the two proteins can be seen directly in Figure 6. The r.m.s, discrepancy for the 46 e q u i v a l e n t a-carbon a t o m s is 3"4 A. We also wished to determine w h e t h e r the a z - a 3 units in the A repressor d i m e r might, by changing the m o n o m e r - m o n o m e r contacts, become rearranged so as to superimpose on those seen in the cro dimer, and vice versa for two cro m o n o m e r s

Residues t h a t are structurally equivalent in cro and k repressor (Fig. 2; Table 1) are boxed. The reported locations of a-helices and fl-strands in the 2 molecules are indicated (Anderson et al+, 1981 ; Pabo & Lewis, 1982). It should be understood t h a t the definition of the ends of such secondary structure elements is somewhat arbitrary, especially when based on preliminary electron-density maps. TherefoPe, slight discrepancies in the designated lengths of the respective helices in cro and ~ repressor do not necessarily imply different conformations or hydrogen-bonding patterns a t the ends of these helices. In cro and in k repressor, residues t h a t are buried are indicated by filled circles and those partially buried (less than 3 A 2 exposure to solvent) by open circles (Lee & Richards, 197l). The absence of a s3qnbol indicates a surface residue completely exposed to solvent. Residues in the respective molecules t h a t are presumed to interact with DNA (Anderson et al., 1981 ; Pabo & Lewis, 1982; Pabo et at+, 1982 ; Ohlendorf et at+, 1982; Lewis et al+, 1982) are capped by an arrowhead.

brought to the A repressor configuration. In order to visualize the possible stereochemical consequences of such rearrangements, we constructed "hypothetical" dimers of cro and A repressor. For example, we took the cro dimer as seen in the crystals and replaced each of its monomers with a monomer of repressor aligned so t h a t its ~2-~3 bihelical unit superimposed on the respective a2-~3 units in each ero monomer. The respective (hypothetical) dimers are shown in Figure 7(a) and (b).

5. Discussion Perhaps the most striking result of comparing cro and A repressor is that, even though the two proteins specifically recognize the same sites on the DNA, their structures are rather different. Only 36 a-carbon atoms (55~/o of the cro structure; 39~/o of the A repressor N-terminal domain) can be considered as structurally equivalent. The structural superimposition confirms the close correspondence of the a2 and a3 helices of the two proteins and also shows that the al helix of cro coincides approximately with the C-terminal part of the longer a 1 helix of A repressor. The structural alignment of the ~2-a3 helical units of cro and A repressor is coincident with the amino acid sequence alignments of these and other DNA binding proteins reported previously (Anderson et al., 1982; Matthews et al., 1982; Sauer et al., 1982). However, the structural alignment of parts of the ~1 helices of cro and A repressor suggests that a revised sequence alignment should be considered in the extreme amino-terminal region. The use of the structural homology to realign amino acid sequences has ample precedence in comparisons of the serine proteases and the cytochromes c (e.g. see James et al., 1978; Almassy & Dickerson, 1978). As can be seen in Figure 8, the six-residue insertion between Argl3 and Phel4 of cro, indicated by the structural homology (see Table 1 and Fig. 2), results in sequence identity between Glu2, Leu7 and Lys8 of ero and Glul3, Leul8 and Lysl9 of repressor. Previous alignments without this deletion yield a single identity (Lys8 of cro and Lys25 of A repressor). In the A repressor structure, residues Lys25 to Gly30 form a short hairpin loop on the surface of the molecule and connecting helices ~l and ~2- Cro lacks such a loop (Figs 3 and 4). Following this revised sequence alignment of cro and A repressor, we reevaluated the sequence homology between the N-terminal parts of the cro and repressor proteins from phages 434 and P22, and the lysogeny establishment proteins (A cII, 434 cII, P22 cl gene products) (Sauer et al., 1982; Anderson et al., 1982; Matthews et al., 1982). The suggested new alignment of these proteins (shown in Fig. 8) is not only based on optimal structural and sequence homology, but also attempts to conserve the same type of amino acid at locations that seem to be structurally or functionally important in the cro and A repressor structures.

T. Sauer & A. R. Poteete, unpublished results).

For example, Leul8 of 2 repressor and Leu7 of cro are buried or nearly buried (Fig. 8) and contribute to the hydrophobic cores of the respective structures. At such locations, hydrophobic residues tend to be strongly conserved. Figure 8 does not modify the previous conclusion that these proteins, among others, contain a two-helical DNA-binding unit similar to that seen in cro, CAP and ~ repressor (Anderson et al., 1982 ; Steitz et al., 1982,1983 ; Sauer et al., 1982). The alignment does, however, suggest new relations between the conformations of the extreme amino-terminal parts of these proteins. The sequence homology with residues Lys25 to Gly30 of 2 repressor suggests t h a t the repressors from phages 434 and P22, as well as cro 434, also contain a connecting loop between an ~ 1 and ~2 helix. (The sequence homology in the N-terminal part of P22 cro is weak and does not clearly suggest that the conformation of this part of the molecule is like any of the others.) When cro and 2 repressor are docked with DNA (see Fig. 5), the connecting region between the ~i and ~2 helices is located near the outermost part of the DNA binding site. The extra loop in 2 repressor is, in part, responsible for the protein extending further outwards than is the case with cro (compare Fig. 6 of Anderson et al. (1981) with Fig. 4(a) of Pabo & Lewis (1982)). I t will also be noted (Fig. 8) that in eases where the connecting loop is presumed to occur (~ repressor, 434 cro, 434 repressor and P22 repressor) it is rich in basic residues. I f indeed these loops contact the phosphate backbone of the DNA, as seems to be structurally feasible, it would provide a structural basis for the observed differences found with different cros and repressors in the pattern of phosphates whose ethylation prevents the binding of these proteins (Fig. 5) (Johnson, 1980; Johnson etal., 1981 ; Poteete & Ptashne, 1982). The DNA binding proteins that contain the a l - a 2 connecting loop could make more intimate contacts with the outermost part of the DNA backbone than the proteins lacking the loop. This is consistent with the observation that phosphates whose ethylation interferes with 2 cro binding are located near the center of the operator site, whereas 2 repressor and P22 repressor have four additional phosphate contacts near the outermost parts of the operator site (Fig. 5). It has been proposed that, when cro binds sequence-specifically to DNA, the protein-DNA contact region could be enhanced by either bending of the DNA or by a hinge motion of the cro dimer, or some combination of the two (Ohlcndorf et al., 1982). If such DNA binding or hinge motion were to occur in a repressor : DNA complex, it would bring the DNA closer to the ~1-~2 connecting loop of ~ repressor and allow this loop to contact the outer phosphates. The three lysogeny establishment activator proteins shown in Figure 8 (2 cII, 434 cII, P22 cl ) seem to lack the a1-~2 connecting loop and, in this respect, appear to be more similar to 2 cro than to 2 repressor. Strikingly, the new alignment suggested in Figure 8 results in an increased correspondence between the amino termini of the lysogeny establishment proteins and that of ~ repressor. I t will be interesting to see whether these three proteins resemble 2 repressor in having N-terminal "arms" that wrap around the back of the DNA (Pabo et al., 1982). The respective models proposed for the binding to DNA of the ~2-a3 helical unit in cro and in 2 repressor are basically similar although there are differences in detail (Anderson et al., 1981; Pabo & Lewis, 1982). In each case the a3 helix is

placed within the major groove of the DNA; however, for A repressor the aminoterminal p a r t of the helix is placed somewhat closer to the double-helical axis of the DNA than is the case with cro. Also the orientation of the ~3 helix relative to the major groove of the DNA differs b y 20 ° or so in both cases. This difference in alignment of the ~3 helices relative to the DNA is reflected in the poor superimposition of the ~2-a3 regions of cro and A repressor dimers (Fig. 6). Although differences clearly exist between the respective crystal structures, it can be asked whether the alignments of the ~2-a3 units in the two protein dimers might become more similar on binding DNA. I t has already been argued t h a t the conformation of A repressor prevents it from binding to DNA in a m a n n e r identical with cro (Pabo & Lewis, 1982). The construction of the hypothetical dimers of the two proteins (Fig. 7) provides further evidence for this. Bringing the %-(x 3 units of A repressor into the same alignment as the a2--O~ units 3 in a dimer of cro would require impossible steric contacts between the A repressor monomers. In particular, the a5 helix of one monomer would interpenetrate the other monomer (Fig. 7(a)). This steric clash might, in principle, be avoided b y a substantial m o v e m e n t of the ~5 helix relative to the rest of the N-terminal domain. However, since such an a d j u s t m e n t would, at the same time, have to conserve the hydrophobic contact between the two a 5 helices in the A repressor dimer, it seems improbable. Similarly, in the hypothetical cro dimer, the monomers must move a p a r t in order to superimpose the ~2-a3 units of cro on the ~2-~3 units in a A repressor dimer (Fig. 7(b)). This also seems improbable. Thus it appears t h a t the ~2-~s binding units of A repressor c a n n o t be superimposed on those of cro, and t h a t the ~2-a3 units of cro cannot be superimposed on those of repressor. While conformational changes to some mutually compatible state are not excluded, the comparisons support the idea t h a t the ~2-a3 units of the two proteins do not a d o p t exactly the same configurations when bound to DNA. In a final test (not shown) we took a monomer of A repressor and aligned it with DNA assuming its a2-a3 unit to be located in exactly the same m a n n e r as proposed for cro bound to DNA (Ohlendorf et al., 1982). In this case there were steric clashes between the DNA and the backbone of A repressor, especially in the vicinity of residues 54 to 60, i.e. the section of the polypeptide following the ~3 helix. Again, it seems t h a t the ~2-~3 units in cro and A repressor do not a d o p t exactly the same alignment when the respective proteins are bound to DNA. These different orientations of the ~2-~3 units with respect to the operator are not too surprising, since the two proteins have substantially different amino acid sequences within their a3 helices (Fig. 8). In particular, cro has two polar, potentially hydrogenbonding residues (Ash31, Lys32) in the middle of its a 3 helix, while A repressor has non-polar residues (Gly48, Ala~9) in analogous positions. I n general terms, cro and A repressor are strikingly similar in their a p p a r e n t modes of interaction with DNA. T h e y both contain the same ~2-~3 unit, and its general a r r a n g e m e n t with respect to the DNA is similar in the two proteins (Figs 5 and 8). However, more detailed comparisons indicate t h a t the structural alignments of cro and A repressor on the DNA are distinctly different. Clearly, the same DNA sequence can be recognized by a rather different set of amino acid side-chains organized in a somewhat different spatial arrangement with respect to

the DNA. This suggests t h a t there is not a simple one-on-one recognition code between amino acids and bases (Anderson et al., 1982; Lewis et al., 1982).
