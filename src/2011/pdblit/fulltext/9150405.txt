Recognition of a TG Mismatch: The Crystal Structure of Very Short Patch Repair Endonuclease in Complex with a DNA Duplex
Susan E. Tsutakawa,* Hisato Jingami, and Kosuke Morikawa* * Department of Structural Biology  Department of Molecular Biology Biomolecular Engineering Research Institute 6-2-3 Furuedai, Suita Osaka 565-0874 Japan to be required for efficient repair of these TG mismatches (Jones et al., 1987; Lieb, 1987), although it remains unclear at which stage they are involved. The recent finding that MutL can enhance Vsr binding to DNA suggests that MutS and MutL initially recognize the mismatch and present it in a loop context for Vsr endonuclease (Drotschmann et al., 1998; Rasmussen et al., 1998). X-ray structural analysis of a truncated form of Vsr endonuclease revealed that Vsr contains a structural Zn2 site and is structurally homologous to the members of the type II restriction endonuclease family (Tsutakawa et al., 1999). Structural comparison with these restriction enzymes and an alanine scan of conserved acidic residues led to the proposal of Asp-51 as a candidate for the first acidic residue in the type II restriction enzyme catalytic motif, DX(6­30)D/EXK. In addition, Vsr is also dependent on Mg2 for activity. However, two histidines, not known in the type II restriction endonuclease family, were also found in the apparent active site, which is located on the central sheet; alanine mutagenesis studies found that His-64 is important for activity, while His-69 is absolutely required. The presence of the histidine and the usage of a structural Zn2 site near to the active site are reminiscent of I-PpoI homing endonuclease (Flick et al., 1998). In addition to Asp-51, the alanine scan identified Glu-25 and Asp-97 as playing important but nonessential roles in Vsr endonuclease activity. In order to understand the molecular basis for mismatch recognition and the role of the histidines in the catalytic mechanism of Vsr endonuclease, we have crystallized the full-length enzyme in the presence of Mg2 and a DNA duplex containing a TG mismatch. In the refined structure, we can clearly observe that the DNA has been cleaved on the 5 side of the mismatched thymidine and that the deoxyribose 3 oxygen has remained coordinated to one of the two Mg2 ions. Multiple protein­DNA interactions, including a remarkable intercalation of aromatic residues on the 3 side of the thymine, also confer the structural basis for TG mismatch recognition. Results and Discussion Structure Determination and General Architecture of the Complex The full-length E. coli Vsr endonuclease was cocrystallized with Mg2 and a 12­base pair DNA duplex containing a TG mismatch and the 5­base pair recognition ° sequence. The structure was determined at 2.3 A by molecular replacement using the truncated Vsr structure (Tsutakawa et al., 1999) as a search model and refined to good stereochemistry and statistics (Table 1). The model includes all 155 residues of the full-length protein with the N-terminal methionine removed in vivo (Tsutakawa et al., 1999), one Zn2 atom, two Mg2 atoms, and three DNA fragments (Figure 1). The N terminus, which was partially removed in the truncated structure solved previously, does not form a

Summary The crystal structure of very short patch repair (Vsr) endonuclease, in complex with Mg2 and with duplex DNA containing a TG mismatch, has been determined ° at 2.3 A resolution. In E. coli, the enzyme recognizes a TG mismatched base pair, generated after spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines, and cleaves the phosphate backbone on the 5 side of the thymine. Extensive interactions between the DNA and the protein characterize a novel recognition mechanism, where three aromatic residues intercalate from the major groove into the DNA to strikingly deform the base pair stacking. With the presence of a cleaved DNA intermediate in the active center, the structure of the Vsr/DNA complex provides detailed insights into the catalytic mechanism for endonuclease activity. Introduction In bacteria, mismatched base pairs generated from spontaneous damage of methylated cytosines pose a difficult problem for DNA repair systems. The ubiquitous MutHLS system, which uses methylation to differentiate between template and newly synthesized strands of DNA, preferentially repairs the strand opposite to methylation sites. In the case where the methylated cytosine spontaneously deaminates and is hydrolyzed to thymine, the MutHLS system would repair the incorrect strand. This would lead not only to incorporation of a mutation into the gene but also to the eventual elimination of all cytosine methylation sites. The Vsr system is responsible for identification and repair of these mismatched TG base pairs. Initially, Vsr endonuclease recognizes a TG mismatch within the duplex 5 CT(A/T)GG, where the second T represents the position of the mismatch and all other bases are in standard Watson-Crick base pairing, and cleaves at the 5 side of the thymine, leaving a 5 phosphate and a 3 hydroxyl at the termini (Sohail et al., 1990; Hennecke et al., 1991; Glasner et al., 1995; Lieb and Bhagwat, 1996). ¨ Subsequently, DNA polymerase I (Dzidic and Radman, 1989) and presumably DNA ligase are involved in the final stages of repair, where fewer than 20 bases on either side of the cleavage site need be excised (Lieb, 1983). In addition, MutL and MutS have also been shown

single helix as predicted by secondary structure analysis of the primary sequence but rather two short helices separated by a flexible linker (Figure 1), in agreement with limited proteolysis studies (Tsutakawa et al., 1999). HelixA, which was observed in the truncated form, has shifted slightly toward the DNA. HelixAA (Lys-7­Arg-15) is inserted into one of the DNA grooves. Although the full-length protein structure is essentially identical to that of the previously solved truncated protein with mostly small shifts to optimize DNA contacts, there was a striking, approximately 110 rotation of the Trp-68 indole ring out of the plane of the main protein surface. The main core of Vsr binds the DNA duplex on the

major groove side, with helixAA pinning down the DNA molecule from the minor groove side, as mostly predicted from the electrostatic surface analysis and distribution of conserved residues of the truncated structure (Tsutakawa et al., 1999). With all base pairing maintained, an opening has been formed at the center of the DNA through intercalation of multiple protein side chains between two DNA base pairs (Figure 2). The DNA itself, which is primarily B form, has been cleaved on the 5 side of the mismatched thymidine with a 3 hydroxyl and a 5 phosphate at the termini, in complete agreement with the biochemical characterization of Vsr endonuclease activity (Hennecke et al., 1991). The conformation of the DNA sugars on either side of the cleavage site was clearly C3 -endo in the simulated annealed omit maps and may be related to Vsr endonuclease function. Although not in any type II restriction enzyme thus far, C3 -endo-form sugars at the cleavage site were also observed in I-PpoI homing endonuclease. The conformation is apparently determined by a combination of the steric complementarity with the protein interface and the coordination requirements of the metal(s). The protein surface shows a strong electrostatic and steric complementarity to the DNA duplex, with the basic regions following along the phosphate backbone (Figure 2B). The strong acidic patch on the protein surface close to the cleaved phosphate corresponds to the metalbinding sites in the catalytic center. This area would be repulsive against the negative charges of the phosphate backbone, partly explaining why divalent metal cations are required for specific binding in DNA mobility shift assays (data not shown). Intercalation of the DNA By far, the most remarkable feature of the protein/DNA complex is the intercalation of three aromatic residues

into the DNA next to the TG mismatch, on the side opposite to the cleavage site (Figures 2C, 2D, and 3). Inserting from the major groove side, Phe-67 stacks with the A/T base pair located at the center of the recognition sequence; Trp-68 directly onto the mispaired thymidine; and Trp-86 with the two sugars on the strand opposite to this thymidine. These three residues are invariantly conserved in the Vsr family (Tsutakawa et al., 1999). Almost as if pinching the DNA, Met-14 and Ile-17 come down from the minor groove side and leave only enough space for the phosphate backbone to pass on either side. Visually striking, the cleaved thymidine remains on one side of this intercalating door gate and separated from its covalently linked strand. The intercalation dramatically affected geometrical parameters of the DNA duplex for base pairs directly on either side of the intercalation site (Dickerson, 1998). For these two base pairs, TG and AT, the base-to-base ° distance (VRISE) increased by approximately 6 A, and the base pairs open up to the major groove by 57

(VROLL), although there is only a slight contraction of the interconnecting phosphate backbone. The overall bend is approximately 44 for the whole duplex DNA. A decrease in the twist angle by base pairs one or two away on either side of the intercalation site (comprised of bases 353­356 and 307­310) shows that the DNA has been significantly unwound, although it is not clear whether this unwinding would facilitate Vsr recognition and/or endonuclease activity or whether it is merely a result of the intercalation. Intercalation of amino acid residues in DNA duplexes has been observed in a multitude of proteins, most of which are involved in transcription. Generally, one to four hydrophobic residues partially insert from the minor groove side and are thought to be critical in bending the DNA (Werner et al., 1996). In the TATA-box DNA/ protein complex, two sets of two phenylanine residues wedging in between stacked base pairs assist in dramatically bending the DNA by almost 70 (Kim et al., 1993a, 1993b; Dickerson, 1998); in the purine repressor/DNA

complex, Leu-54 and its symmetry-related mate, Leu54 (Schumacher et al., 1994); in the high mobility group domain (HMG) of the Y sex reversal activator/DNA complex, Met-9, Phe-12, Ile-13, and Trp-43 (Werner et al., 1995); in the HMG domain of LEF-1/DNA complex, Met10, Met-13, and Phe-9 (Love et al., 1995); in the integration host factor/DNA complex, Pro-65 (Rice et al., 1996); in the PUT3 transcription activator/DNA complex, Ile69 and Val-70 (Swaminathan et al., 1997); in both Sac7D and Sso7d DNA/protein complexes, Val-26 and Met-29 (Gao et al., 1998; Robinson et al., 1998); and in the HMG protein HMG1/DNA complex, Phe-37 (Ohndorf et al., 1999). These residues generally form a small wedge that partially disrupts DNA stacking and that thereby contributes to the unwinding of the DNA to form more of an A-type DNA with a larger minor groove and a compressed major groove. The Vsr/DNA complex differs substantially from this class of protein DNA-intercalators. First, the three aromatic residues approach the DNA from the major groove side. Second, the two-sided intercalation door, formed together with Met-14 and Ile-17, completely separates the base pairs on either side of the intercalation site. Finally, both major and minor grooves are significantly widened, the latter of which is evidenced in the minor groove by the presence of an helix, which is usually sterically prevented. Intercalation and binding to the five­base pair­specific recognition sequence are supported by an extensive network of direct and water-mediated DNA/protein interactions (Figure 3). The DNA is approached from all directions, with multiple contacts to the phosphate

backbone as well as to both major and minor groove sides of the bases. A significant number of direct protein contacts came from the amide backbone, which would provide a less flexible interface, and almost 20% of the protein surface is buried in the DNA complex. The highest concentration of protein/DNA contacts was surprisingly not directed so much to the TG mismatch as to the phosphate backbone and base pairs of the central region, as if stabilization of the DNA intercalation is of primary importance.

Mismatch Recognition Unlike mismatched repair proteins, MutY glycosylase (Guan et al., 1998), and the uracil DNA-glycosylases (Slupphaug et al., 1996; Barrett et al., 1998; Parikh et al., 1998), which use base flipping of mismatched base pairs, Vsr recognizes the TG mismatch within the context of the DNA double helix. As seen in structural studies of TG mismatch­containing DNA duplexes (Kneale et al., 1985; Hunter et al., 1986, 1987; Allawi and SantaLucia, 1998), the TG mismatch forms a classical wobble pair with hydrogen bonds formed respectively by O6 and N1 of the guanine and N3 and O2 of the thymine (Figure 4A). The guanine is recognized from the major and minor groove sides with Lys-89 and with the main chain carbonyl of Met-14, respectively. Interestingly, for the other base in the mismatch, the only major groove contact that could differentiate thymine from cytosine would be made by an invariant Asn-93. Although specific recognition of the mismatch seems relatively meager, steric recognition is evident from the complementarity of the

protein surface to the DNA (Figure 2B) and after superimposition of the guanine group with that from a GC Watson-Crick base pair (Figure 4B). Consistent with previous studies of TG mismatch­containing DNA, the thymine has been significantly shifted into the major groove compared to the normal base pair. In Vsr, this shift is sterically encoded into the interface, and the normal Watson-Crick base pair would push against Thr19 and disrupt the N terminus, which has been shown to be important for endonuclease activity (Tsutakawa

et al., 1999). In addition, a Watson-Crick GC base pairing would move the scissile phosphate significantly out of the range of the catalytically essential residues, Asp-51 and His-69. Although the intercalation must be considered, examination of contacts to the phosphate backbone, deformed by the wobble base pairing, reveals multiple contacts (Figure 3). In addition to the apparent direct contacts with the TG base pair and to the deformed backbone, intercalation may also play a role in the recognition of the TG

mismatch. In the crystal structure of a B form DNA containing TG mismatches, the residues directly neighboring the TG mismatch are significantly perturbed (Hunter et al., 1987). In particular, the shift of the wobble pair into the major groove disrupts stacking with the base pair on the 5 side of the mismatched guanine and results in an increase in the distance between the two base pairs (RISE). In the Vsr/DNA complex, intercalation occurs on this particular side of the TG mismatch, thereby developing a role for intercalation in recognition of the disrupted stacking of a TG mismatched base pair. One of the questions that have been generated from this work is how Vsr initially recognizes and intercalates into the DNA. At a certain step in the binding, Trp-86 must flip out of the main plane of the Vsr protein core to intercalate and stack with the mismatched thymine. In addition, the proposed role of intercalation in recognition of the DNA explains how MutL and MutS may be involved in the Vsr system; loop formation, by MutL and MutS, would partially deform the DNA and further exaggerate the stacking deviations of the TG mispair, enhancing recognition and binding by Vsr. This form of recognition of damaged DNA is distinct

from other DNA repair enzymes, which often use a flipping-out mechanism in their identification and resolution of damaged DNA (Roberts and Cheng, 1998). These enzymes, which include two mismatch repair enzymes, UDG (Slupphaug et al., 1996; Barrett et al., 1998; Parikh et al., 1998) and MutY (Guan et al., 1998), are often base excision glycosidases, and in their catalytic mechanisms, base flipping facilitates the access of catalytic chemical groups to the damaged moiety. Vsr, on the other hand, only needs to recognize the mismatched base pair and initiates the repair process by nicking the more accessible phosphate backbone. Therefore, neither the recognition nor catalytic mechanisms, in the case of Vsr, require the bases to be flipped out. Structural Basis for Recognition of the Five­Base Pair Sequence In the structure of the DNA complex, recognition of the five­base pair sequence, 5 CTAGG/3 GGTCC, occurs through an interlaced network that includes bases from either strand and where one residue does not necessarily correspond to one base; over 80% of the interactions with the bases are from "shared" residues (Figure 3).

Crystal Structure of the Vsr/DNA Complex 621

Analysis of the contacts generally shows good agreement with the substrate specificity requirements quantified by in vitro activity assays (Hennecke et al., 1991; Glasner et al., 1995), with two notable observations. ¨ First, only one direct contact, R120, is involved in major groove side recognition of the base pair G356:C306, the fourth base pair, which has an absolute requirement for a GC base pair. Second, the third base pair, which can flexibly accept AT or TA, has the greatest number of interactions, of which the two direct contacts seem to be specific for only the AT base pair. Specificity may lie more in its ability to tolerate the intercalation. Magnesium­Water Clusters in the Catalytic Center The active site of Vsr endonuclease is located at the juncture between the short and long strands of the central sheet. The cleaved phosphate, on the 5 side of the mismatched thymine, enters into the active site and is coordinated directly to His-69, shown to be essential for endonuclease activity (Tsutakawa et al., 1999) and to two Mg2 ions (Figure 5). These Mg2 ions were identified by their octahedral shape in the electron density maps as magnesium­water clusters. The cleaved deoxy° ribose-3 -oxygen was observed at a distance of 2.3 A from one of the Mg2 ions, suggesting that the DNA is still in an intermediate stage where the oxygen has not yet been protonated; this distance between the cleaved oxygen was also observed in I-PpoI endonuclease to the single Mn2 atom found in their study (Flick et al., 1998) and in endonuclease IV to one of the three Zn2 atoms (Hosfield et al., 1999). In the DNA-free Vsr endonuclease, His-69 coordinated a Mn2 atom in metal soaking experiments of the crystals (Tsutakawa et al., 1999); the difference in the coordination scheme suggests a reorganization of metal sites in the catalytic center upon DNA binding. Notably, Asp-51, which is coordinating both Mg2 ions, is invariantly conserved and absolutely required for endonuclease activity (Tsutakawa et al., 1999). Magnesium­water clusters in endonucleases were recently found in the apoenzyme structure of Serratia endonuclease, where only one protein side chain, Asn119, is coordinated to a single Mg2 ion, whose preferred octahedral coordination geometry is fulfilled by five solvent molecules (Miller et al., 1999) and in I-PpoI, where the single metal is bound by four water molecules, Asn119, and the cleaved DNA ribose oxygen (Flick et al., 1998). In the case of Vsr, two and three water molecules, along with protein and DNA atoms, coordinate with each of the two Mg2 atoms. The importance of these clusters in Vsr endonuclease is supported by the facts that two residues, Glu-25 and His-64, which are within the hydrogen bonding distance of the clusters, are important for endonuclease activity and that all the side chains, which are within the hydrogen bonding distance of one of the clusters, are highly or invariantly conserved among Vsr family proteins (Tsutakawa et al., 1999). The occupancy of the two Mg2 atoms appears to be equivalent with B ° values of 24.9 and 22.5 A2 (Table 1) and with peaks heights of 13.7 and 13.8 , respectively, in a simulated annealed Fo Fc map where the magnesium­water clusters have been omitted. In addition, the similarity of the B values to that of the Zn2 atom, which has been shown

to be fully occupied (Tsutakawa et al., 1999), would suggest that these sites are also both fully occupied and that Vsr endonuclease employs a two-metal mechanism. This Vsr/DNA complex provides the structural basis for a potential mechanism for endonuclease activity. The phosphate oxygen coordinated by one of the Mg2 ions and by His-69 is likely to have been the attacking water molecule. Presumably, the Mg2 ion acted as a Lewis acid to activate the water, and His-69, whose pKa would be increased by the hydrogen bonding of the other nitrogen to Asp-97, would have acted as the proton acceptor. DNAseI, exonuclease III, and HAP1 endonuclease use a similar histidine­aspartate pair in their nuclease mechanisms (Weston et al., 1992; Mol et al., 1995; Gorman et al., 1997). The coordination of another scissile phosphate oxygen by both Mg2 ions may have stabilized the pentacoordinate intermediate as described in the classical two-metal mechanism (Beese and Steitz, 1991). For type II restriction enzymes, a neighboring DNA phosphate has been proposed to activate the water in a substrate-assisted mechanism (Pingoud and Jeltsch, 1997); in the Vsr/DNA complex, although the DNA on the 3 side of the cleaved phosphate coordinates one of the waters in the magnesium­water clusters, the geometry would suggest that it was not directly involved in Vsr catalysis (not shown in figure). The structure of the Vsr/DNA complex has revealed an enzyme that, while conserving certain elements with other endonucleases, has been specifically tailored to its functional requirements. Although the position and function of Asp-51 and the overall topology of Vsr are similar to type II restriction enzymes, the remainder of the catalytic center, such as His-64, Glu-25, and His69, has been customized to a mechanism involving the two magnesium­water clusters. Furthermore, the fully intercalated aromatic side chains into the DNA, which have not been observed yet in any other DNA-binding enzyme, appear to be a major factor for the recognition and binding of the TG mismatch, in addition to the many polar and steric interactions between protein atoms and the deformed backbone in close vicinity to the mismatched base pair.
Experimental Procedures Crystallization E. coli Vsr protein was expressed and purified as previously described (Tsutakawa et al., 1999). The 12-mer oligonucleotides, used to make the complex, were synthesized and purified twice by reverse phase HPLC (Becks). Single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were quantified by UV spectrometry, mixed with an equimolar amount of the complementary strand, and annealed in the presence of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5). The duplex DNA (1.5 mM), containing a TG mismatch, full-length protein (0.5 mM), and 20 mM MgCl2, were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and then mixed in a 1:1 ratio with Natrix solution #5 (Hampton Research). The final 1 crystallization solution, which also includes protein and DNA buffers, was 2.5% PEG 8K, 25 mM MES (pH 5.6), 100 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 6.5 mM Tris (pH 7.5), and 31.0 mM NaCl. Drops (4 l) were placed in Terasaki plates under 5 CS Silicone SH200 oil (Dow-Corning) and concentrated by a variation of the microbatch method. Single crystals, which appeared in 3 weeks at 20 C, were transferred into a cryoprotection harvest solution (4 crystallization solution and 30% glycerol) for less than 30 s and immediately placed into the cryostream at 100 K. Intensity data were collected at BL24A in SPring-8, Harima,

Cell 622

Japan (Table 1), and all data were processed by the use of the DENZO/SCALEPACK crystallographic data reduction package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The crystal belongs to the space group ° ° ° P65, with unit cell dimensions a 63.0 A, b 63.0 A, c 152.5 A, 90 , 90 , 120 , and contains one molecule of Vsr protein and one duplex DNA per asymmetric unit. Phasing, Model Building, and Refinement The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method, using AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The search model was the truncated Vsr structure (Tsutakawa et al., 1999) trimmed of potentially flexible regions and side chains, and the calculation was carried out for ° intensity data from 15 to 3.5 A. The correct solution, with a correlation of 44.0% and an R value of 47.7%, was clearly distinguishable from others, where the next highest solution had corresponding values of 31.8% and 52.0%, respectively. Initial density maps were generated using SFALL, SIGMAA, and DM implemented in the CCP4 program suite (1994). The truncated Vsr model, with all residues from 30 to 156, was placed into the density and was manually adjusted in QUANTA 97. Another round of SFALL, SIGMAA, and DM improved the map, and some of the DNA bases could be clearly placed into the model. After a third round of SFALL/SIGMAA/DM, 95% of the protein and DNA could be placed into the density, and the ° model was refined gradually to 2.3 A using rounds of CNS (Brunger et ¨ al., 1998) and manual adjustment. Five percent of the data was excluded during all stages of refinement for calculation of Rfree (Brunger, 1992). A maximum likelihood residual, bulk solvent correc¨ tion, a cutoff of two, and group or individual anisotropic B factor refinement was applied in CNS, and the low resolution cutoff was ° 22 A. The Zn2 atom coordination and the DNA hydrogen bonding, sugar puckers, and base planarity were restrained during refinement. Initially, all sugars were assumed to be C2'-endo, and four sugars (the two sugars on either side of the cleavage site and the sugars of nucleosides 307 and 362) were changed to C3 -endo in accordance with simulated annealed omit and negative difference Fourier maps. Water molecules were placed conservatively within ° 3.5 A of the protein or another water molecule and were removed Fc electron density was lower than 1 . As in many if the 2Fo crystallographic studies of DNA molecules, a number of significant ° electron density peaks were observed within approximately 2.4 A from phosphate oxygens, and they were modeled as water molecules, because of too low density to define them as metals. The side chains of Lys-77 and Glu-106 could not be modeled unambiguously, and their occupancy was defined as zero. On the Ramachandran plot by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), 90.7% of the backbone angles were in the most favored region, and 9.3% were in the additional allowed region. The DNA model was analyzed by FREEHEL98 (Dickerson, 1998), and conclusions are drawn with the caveat that the DNA molecule was a major crystallographic contact. Structural figures were drawn in QUANTA 97, unless otherwise stated. The solvent-accessible surface was calculated in GRASP ° (Nicholls et al., 1991) using a 1.4 A radius probe.
