We report a method for site-specifically incorporating L-lysine derivatives into proteins in mammalian cells, based on the expression of the pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS)-tRNAPyl pair from Methanosarcina mazei. Different types of external promoters were tested for the expression of tRNAPyl in Chinese hamster ovary cells. When tRNAPyl was expressed from a gene cluster under the control of the U6 promoter, the wild-type PylRS-tRNAPyl pair facilitated the most efficient incorporation of a pyrrolysine analog, Netert-butyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine (Boc-lysine), into proteins at the amber position. This PylRS-tRNAPyl system yielded the Boc-lysine-containing protein in an amount accounting for 1% of the total protein in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. We also created a PylRS variant specific to Ne-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine, to incorporate this long, bulky, non-natural lysine derivative into proteins in HEK293. The recently reported variant specific to Ne-acetyllysine was also expressed, resulting in the genetic encoding of this naturally-occurring lysine modification in mammalian cells.

Keywords: Pyrrolysine tRNA Acetyllysine Benzyloxycarbonyllysine Non-natural amino acid Protein engineering

The biosynthesis of proteins containing non-natural amino acids, or alloproteins [1], is a promising way to facilitate protein science and molecular biology. Non-natural chemical groups, such as photo-inducible crosslinkers and fluorescent groups, and naturally-occurring post-translational modifications have thus been incorporated into proteins [2­4]. The cell-based, site-specific incorporation of non-natural amino acids into proteins relies on the expression of the pair of a tRNA and an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) variant specific to a non-natural amino acid in the host organism [2]. This aaRS-tRNA pair should not cross-react with any endogenous aaRS or tRNA species in the host cell, thus being ``orthogonal" to the host aminoacylation system [5,6]. Therefore, an archaeal or eukaryal aaRS-tRNA pair has been used in Escherichia coli [2,7,8], whereas a bacterial pair has been employed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells [2­4]. The employed tRNA species are engineered to recognize nonsense codons, the amber (UAG), ochre (UAA), and opal (UGA) codons, and four-letter codons [2,9,10]. On the other hand, a variety of aaRS variants that specifically recognize non-natural amino acids have been created by engineering tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases

from E. coli [2­4] and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii [2]. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase [2], phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase [7,8], lysyl-tRNA synthetase [2], and leucyl-tRNA synthetase [2] have also produced useful variants. Thus, the genetic code has been expanded to include a variety of amino acids with an aromatic ring bound to the b-methylene group and several other amino acids with different backbone structures. Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS), found in certain archaeal and bacterial species, directly esterifies tRNAPyl with pyrrolysine (Fig. 1), a lysine derivative with the Ne atom in an amide linkage with a pyrroline ring [11,12]. tRNAPyl is a natural amber suppressor, and it has non-canonical primary and secondary structures that are recognized by PylRS. The introduction of the archaeal PylRS-tRNAPyl pair into E. coli cells reportedly resulted in the incorporation of pyrrolysine and its analog, Ne-cyclopentyloxycarbonyl-Llysine (Cyc), into proteins at the amber position [12­14]. The engineering of PylRS could facilitate the incorporation of non-natural amino acids with a bulky chemical group at the Ne atom of L-lysine. The structural basis for the substrate recognition has been elucidated by determining the crystal structures of Methanosarcina mazei PylRS complexed with its amino acid substrates [15­17]. The pyrroline ring of pyrrolysine as well as the pentane ring of Cyc is buried in a large, hydrophobic cavity at one end of the deep amino-acid-binding pocket of the enzyme. Based on the crystal structure, a variant specific to Ne-acetyllysine (AcLysRS) was recently created from Methanosarcina barkeri PylRS for use in E. coli cells;

the pcDNA4/TO lacking the sequence between the two PvuII sites, to create pOriP. For experiments with HEK293 c-18, the PylRS, LacZ(Am91) and GST(Am25) genes and 9ÂtRNAPyl, except for GRB2, were carried on pOriP. Amber suppression in mammalian cells. The plasmid transfection and the analysis of the expression of reporter genes were performed as described previously [3,4,20]. HEK293 c-18 cells were from ATCC (No.CRL-10852). To express tRNAPyl, PylRSs, and reporter genes, CHO or HEK293 c-18 cells were transfected with the corresponding expression plasmids. As for the expression of the T7-tRNAPyl gene, CHO cells were transfected with the PCR product of this gene and pT7RNAP. After transfection, the cells were incubated in the presence/absence of 1 mM Boc-lysine/Z-lysine in growth media for 16 h (CHO) and for 40 h (HEK293) before analysis. For the incorporation of acetyllysine, both types of cells were incubated for 16 h after transfection. Amber suppression in E. coli cells. The plasmids used for the expression of tRNAPyl and PylRS in E. coli are described, together with the methods for PylRS engineering, in Supplementary material.

Results the large, hydrophobic cavity is plugged in this variant by substitutions with bulky amino acids [18]. In the present study, we developed a method for the efficient, site-specific incorporation of L-lysine derivatives in mammalian cells with the PylRS-tRNAPyl pair from M. mazei. This method was applied, together with engineered PylRS variants, to incorporate Ne-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine (Z-lysine) (Fig. 1), which is larger than pyrrolysine, and acetyllysine into proteins. Materials and methods Amino acids. Boc-lysine, Z-lysine, and acetyllysine were purchased from Bachem. Z-lysine was dissolved in 1 M HCl at a concentration of 100 mM. Growth media supplemented with this solution were neutralized with 1 N NaOH before use. Plasmids used in mammalian cells. Four tRNAPyl genes were constructed. The first gene consisted of the tRNAPyl coding sequence (GGAAACCTGATCATGTAGATCGAATGGACTCTAAATCCGTTCAGCCG GGTTAGATTCCCGGGGTTTCCG), followed by the terminator (GACA AGTGCGGTTTTT), being cloned in the vector pCR4 Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen). The second consisted of the 50 -leader of the human tRNATyr gene (AGCGCTCCGGTTTTTCTGTGCTGAACCTCAGGGGACGC CGACACACGTACACGTC), the human tRNAVal sequence (GTTTCCG TAGTGTAGTGGTCATCACGTTCGCCTAACACGCGAAAGGTCCCCGGTT CGAAACCGGGCGGAAACA), a spacer (AGATCTTCTAGACTCGAG), the tRNAPyl sequence, and the terminator in this order, being cloned in pCR4 Blunt-TOPO. The third consisted of the human U6 promoter with the CMV enhancer [19], the spacer, tRNAPyl, and the terminator in this order, being cloned in pUC119. The fourth consisted of the T7 promoter, the spacer, tRNAPyl, and the terminator in this order, being cloned in pBR322. Nine tandem copies of the U6-tRNAPyl gene lacking the CMV enhancer were cloned in the SspI-EcoRV sites of pBR322. The wild-type PylRS gene, with an N-terminal FLAG tag, was cloned in the vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen). The T7 RNA polymerase gene was cloned in pcDNA4/TO to create pT7RNAP. The LacZ(Am91) and GRB2(Am111) genes were previously described [20]. Twenty-four residues (MASMTGGQQMGRD PGANSGVTKNS) were added at the N-terminus of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene from the vector pGEX (Amersham Biosciences). Met at the original N-terminus, now at position 25, was mutated into the amber codon to create GST(Am25). The oriP sequence from pCEP4 (Invitrogen) was cloned in the MunI site of Site-specific incorporation of Boc-lysine into proteins in CHO cells with the wild-type PylRS and tRNAPyl pair A pyrrolysine analog, Ne-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine (Boc-lysine), is recognized by the wild-type PylRS (Yanagisawa et al., unpublished data). This pair of Boc-lysine and the wild-type PylRS was used to develop a tRNAPyl expression system suitable for the efficient incorporation of L-lysine derivatives into proteins in mammalian cells. Amber mutant genes for GRB2 and LacZ were used as reporter genes to analyze the amber suppression caused by the PylRS-tRNAPyl pair, together with Boc-lysine supplemented in growth media at a concentration of 1 mM. The GRB2 and LacZ genes contained an amber codon at positions 111 and 91, respectively. The GRB2 gene was tagged with a C-terminal FLAG. The full-length product of GRB2(Am111)-FLAG is larger than that of the endogenous GRB2. An anti-GRB2 antibody detected both of these GRB2 molecules. Most of the prokaryotic tRNA genes, including tRNAPyl, lack the internal promoter sequence found among the eukaryotic tRNA genes, and are not expected to be expressed in eukaryotic cells. In fact, the introduction of the coding sequence for tRNAPyl (Fig. 2A, P1), together with the wild-type PylRS gene, into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was not sufficient for the expression of the GRB2 and LacZ reporter genes (Fig. 2B and C, respectively). Therefore, we examined the applicability of external promoters [21­24] for the expression of tRNAPyl. The human tRNAVal gene lacking its transcriptional terminator, the U6 promoter, and the bacteriophage T7 promoter were linked to the 50 end of the coding sequence for tRNAPyl (Fig. 2A). The U6 promoter was used together with the CMV enhancer to increase the amount of transcript [19], and for the use of T7 promoter, T7 RNA polymerase was expressed in the cell. Amber suppression occurred to produce GRB2-FLAG, when tRNAPyl was expressed using the human tRNAVal sequence, the U6 promoter, and the T7 promoter (Fig. 2B, lanes 9, 13, and 17, respectively) each in the presence of PylRS and Boc-lysine. The expressed GRB2-FLAG probably contained Boc-lysine at the amber position, because the amber suppression did not occur when Boc-lysine was removed from the growth medium (Fig. 2B, lanes 8, 12, and 16). Among the tested promoters, the U6 promoter provided the highest yield of GRB2-FLAG, which was comparable to the amount of endogenous GRB2 (Fig. 2B, lane 13). The b-galactosidase activity

obtained with the use of the U6 promoter was found to be 2-fold and 4-fold higher than those obtained with the use of the tRNAVal system and the T7 promoter, respectively (Fig. 2C). To further increase the yield of Boc-lysine-containing proteins, we next constructed a cluster of nine copies of the tRNAPyl gene, each expressed from the U6 promoter (Fig. 2A, P5); the CMV enhancer was removed from each copy to reduce the overall size of the gene cluster. This gene cluster (9 Â tRNAPyl system) successfully increased the amber suppression efficiency, by a factor of two as compared with a single copy of CMV-U6-tRNAPyl (Fig. 2C). Site-specific incorporation of Boc-lysine into proteins in HEK293 cells using the high-yielding EBNA1-oriP system We tested the applicability of the PylRS-tRNAPyl pair in another mammalian cell type, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. HEK293 cells constitutively expressing the EBNA1 protein from the Epstein­Barr virus, such as HEK293 c-18 cells, have been used for the high-level, transient expression of recombinant genes, which are carried on vectors with the oriP sequence [25,26]. This EBNA1-oriP system was used to produce lysine derivative-containing proteins, in combination with the PylRS-9 Â tRNAPyl system. The LacZ(Am91) and PylRS genes, and 9 Â tRNAPyl were each cloned on an oriP vector, and were then introduced into HEK293 c-18 cells. The growth media was supplemented with Boc-lysine. The full-length LacZ(Am91) was thus expressed in the HEK cells, and was purified by immunoprecipitation, yielding 8 lg for 6 Â 106 cells, which accounted for 1% of the total protein. The removal of Boc-lysine decreased the b-Gal activity due to the fulllength LacZ by a factor of 2000, indicating that Boc-lysine was incorporated at the amber position. This HEK293 system yielded a 15-fold larger amount of the Boc-lysine-containing LacZ than that obtained from CHO cells with the PylRS-9 Â tRNAPyl system. Finally, the incorporation of Boc-lysine was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene with the amber codon at position 25, GST(Am25), was similarly expressed

in HEK293 c-18 cells, and the full-length products of GST were subjected to trypsin digestion. The peptide corresponding to residues 23À33 contained Boc-lysine, whereas there was no signal indicating the occurrence of Boc-lysine in other peptides (Supplementary Fig. S1). Site-specific incorporation of lysine derivatives into proteins in mammalian cells with engineered PylRS variants To expand the system to incorporate bulky, non-natural lysine derivatives in mammalian cells, we engineered PylRS to be specific to Z-lysine by genetic selections using E. coli cells, as described in Supplementary material. The obtained variant (designated as ZLysRS) has the L309A and C348V substitutions at the pyrrolysine binding pocket (Fig. 3A and B) and three mutations at the other sites. ZLysRS, together with tRNAPyl, produced the full-length product of GST(Am25) in E. coli cells (6.9 mg/l in minimal medium containing 1 mM Z-lysine), whereas no corresponding product was produced in the absence of Z-lysine (Fig. 3E). A mass spectrometric analysis showed that Z-lysine was contained at position 25 of the GST, and there was no signal corresponding to peptides containing other amino acids at the amber position (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, ZLysRS recognizes Z-lysine specifically, and discriminates against the canonical amino acids. We expressed the ZLysRS-tRNAPyl pair and GRB2(Am111)-FLAG in HEK293 c-18 cells, in the presence of 1 mM Z-lysine in the growth medium. The full-length product of GRB2(Am111)-FLAG was detected by Western blotting, whereas no corresponding product was obtained in the absence of Z-lysine (Fig. 3F). This observation showed that ZLysRS specifically recognizes Z-lysine in the mammalian cell, and only Z-lysine was incorporated at the amber position. The applicability of Z-lysine as well as Boc-lysine was demonstrated in another eukaryotic system, S. cerevisiae, as described in Supplementary material. The feasibility of the incorporation of Ne-acetyllysine into proteins in mammalian cells was then examined. The four substitutions

(L305I, Y306F, L309A, and C348F) at the binding pocket out of the six mutations found in AcLysRS from M. barkeri were transplanted into M. mazei PylRS to create mAcLysRS. The binding-pocket residues are well conserved between the M. mazei and M. barkeri PylRSs [18]. The mAcLysRS facilitated the expression of the fulllength GRB2(Am111)-FLAG in mammalian cells, in the presence of 14 mM acetyllysine in the growth medium; the expression level was comparable to that of the endogenous GRB2 (Fig. 3G). This level was moderate for a use of the EBNA1-oriP system, because this system was used for the expression of only mAcLysRS and tRNAPyl, but not GRB2-FLAG. Discussion In the present study, we developed a method for the efficient, site-specific incorporation of L-lysine derivatives into proteins in mammalian cells. A variety of human cells and other mammalian cells will be available by using the EBNA1-oriP system [25­27]. Our results demonstrated that the PylRS-tRNAPyl pair is orthogonal to the eukaryotic aaRS-tRNA system. The orthogonality of this pair has been shown in E. coli. PylRS reportedly recognizes the noncanonical structure of tRNAPyl [14], which explains the observation that PylRS does not recognize the cytoplasmic tRNAs in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. On the other hand, tRNAPyl chemically ligated with fluorescent amino acids were used in an insect cell-free translation, indicating that tRNAPyl is not recognized by the insect aaRSs [28]. The double orthogonality of the PylRStRNAPyl pair allows the development of PylRS variants in E. coli and their subsequent use in eukaryotic cells. The modeling of the binding pockets of ZLysRS and AcLysRS explains the structural basis for the substrate recognition by these variants (Fig. 3B and C). The replacement of Leu309 by a smaller amino acid, Ala, occurs in these variants in common. In ZLysRS,

the space generated by this replacement allows the accommodation of the benzyloxy group, which is larger than a pyrroline ring, in a flat slot between Tyr306 and Val348. The enlarged size of the binding pocket fits the bulky Z-lysine (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, the same space allows the replacement of Cys348 by a bulky Phe in AcLysRS, which plugs the hydrophobic cavity for the pyrroline ring moiety, adjusting the size of the binding pocket to that of acetyllysine. By expanding the binding pocket, as in ZLysRS, large functional groups, such as biophysical probes and photo-crosslinking groups, could be introduced into proteins. The long, aliphatic linker keeps these bulky groups distal to the main chain of protein to avoid steric hindrance. Lysine acetylation is a reversible post-translational modification that occurs on histones [29] and many other proteins [30], including p53 [31], and is regulated dynamically by acetyltransferases and deacetylases. The translational incorporation of acetyllysine by the PylRS-tRNAPyl pair at defined positions of these proteins provides a useful tool for studying the biological roles of lysine acetylation in mammalian cells. In analyzing the dynamic regulation through lysine acetylation, the proteins synthesized with acetyllysine residues may be used to define the initial condition. These translationally modified proteins can be substituted for their endogenous counterparts in mammalian cells by using knock-out technology, such as RNA interference.
