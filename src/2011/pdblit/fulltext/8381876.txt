The three-dimensional structure of acyl-coenzyme A binding protein as encoded by the recombinant gene in Escherichia coli has been determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) spectroscopy. The structure consists of four cr-helices Al (residues 3 to 15), A2 (residues 20 to 36), A3 (residues 51 to 60), and A4 (residues 65 to 85). Al and A4, and A2 and A3, run in parallel pairs. A2 runs anti-parallel to Al and A4. The three-dimensional structure of the protein is reminiscent of a shallow bowl with a rim. The "rim" is characterized by many polar and charged groups, whereas the inside and outside surface is predominantly hydrophobic with patches of uncharged polar hydroxyl groups of threonyl, serinyl and tyrosyl residues. The inside bottom contains though two a-amino groups of lysine residues (Lysl3 and Lys32) suggesting that the binding site for the nucleotide part of the acyl-coenzyme A part of the ligand molecule is at the inside surface of the bowl. The structure determination was done on the basis of measurements of the intensities of nuclear Overhauser effects (NOES) and coupling constants that were translated into interatom distance restraints for 833 atom pairs, and 87 dihedral angle restraints, of which 23 were in chiral centers. In all, 42 hydrogen bonds were identified by n.m.r. and provided an additional 84 distance restraints. A total of 20 structures were calculated and the structures can be aligned to a root-mean-square deviation of 0.5 A for the backbone atoms of the residues in the four helices. A region of six residues could not be defined by the restraints obtained by n.m.r. The program Pronto was used for the spectrum analysis in general, and especially for the assignment of the individual NOES, the integration of the cross peaks, and the measurements of the coupling constants. The programs DIANA and X-PLOR have been used in the structure calculations and evaluations.

a distance restraint range between 1.8 and 2.0 A for the 0-HN distance and between 27 and 30 A for the O-N distance. The structure calculations were performed in 4 steps using firstly the program DIANA (Giinthert et al., 1991) followed by 3.75 ps simulated annealing at 1000 K (Nilges et al., 1988), 20 ps restrained molecular dynamics at 300K (Clore et al., 1985, 1986) without hydrogen bonds and finally 2.0 ps at 300 K with the hydrogen bond restraints included. The last 3 steps were performed using the program X-PLOR version 2.1 (Briinger, 1990). All calculations were performed on a Silicon Graphics 320 Power Station. Displays of structures were performed using the computer program Insight of Biosym Technologies Inc. (San Diego, CA). All geometrical and energetical structure parameters used for the evaluation and description of the structures obtained at each step of the structure calculation were obtained by using X-PLOR version 2.1 with the exception of a few statistical procedures. Average dihedral angles and their standard deviation were calculated as described by S. Ludvigsen & F. M. Paulsen (unpublished results).

2. Methods
The description of the experimental procedures concerning the recording of the data and processing of `H n.m.r. spectra and their assignments have been published (Andersen et al., 1991). All spectra were recorded on a Bruker 600 MHz AMX spectrometer, in contrast to our previous work on the assignment of the n.m.r. spectra and the determination of the secondary structure, which was carried out on the basis of spectrum recordings at 500 MHz. The nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra were recorded with mixing times of 50 and 200 ms, respectively. Improved resolution and technology has led to an increased number of signal assignments that will be made available in the submission of the structures to the Protein Data Bank?. The computer program Pronto (Kjsr et al., 1991) was used in the spectrum analysis providing the tools and facilities for assignment of the NOESY spectrum, integration of the NOE cross-peaks, and the measuring of 3JnNH. coupling constants (Ludvigsen et al, 1991). Stereospecific assignments were obtained from measurements of the `JNHp coupling constants of "N-enriched rACBP using the method described by Mont&one et al. (1989), and combined with measurements of 3Jn.HB1 and 3Jn.Hl~, and with measurements of HN-HB NOES. The position of the hydrogen bonds was obtained from the secondary structure determination using only those in the a-helices defined there (Andersen et al., 1991). For the conversion of the n.m.r. measurements to distance and angle restraints the NOES were divided into the 3 common classes of strong, medium and weak corresponding, respectively, to the 3 sets of distance boundaries with a common lower boundary of 18 A (1 A = 91 nm) and upper limits of 2.7 A, 3.3 A and 5.0 A, which were increased by 65 A in the cases where methyl group protons were involved in the NOE (Williamson et al., 1985; Clore et al., 1985, 1986). 3JuNH. were converted to &angles using the simple conversion that coupling constants larger than 7 Hz and a weak HN-H' NOE would set the &angle restraints between -80" and - 160", and coupling constants smaller than 6 Hz and medium HN-H' NOES would set the &angle restraint to Restraints for the the range between - 17" and -97". dihedral angles x1 were calculated on the basis of the stereospecific assignments and set respectively at 1 of the 3 staggered conformation allowing f 60" as the upper and lower boundary, respectively. Hydrogen bonds defined as distance restraints were sometimes applied and then set to

assigned NOES. Of these 833 were identified as socalled non-trivial NOES and subsequently used as distance restraints according to their intensities as 61 strong, 213 medium and 559 weak NOES. The distribution with respect to intra-residue, shortrange (i, j 1Ji -jl I 5), and long-range NOES were 124, 375 and 334, respectively, and the distribution by residue of these is shown in Figure 1. In all, 64 dihedral restraints for the &angles were applied in the calculations. The majority of these, 57, were in the u-helical range ( - 17" to -97") and obtained by measurements of 3JnNn" coupling constants smaller than 6 Hz, Only seven residues had &angles restrained in the range -80" to - 160", resulting from the measured coupling constants being larger
than 7 Hz. The conformation in 23 chiral centers was measured resulting in the determination of a

Finally the contributions to the total energy of the 20 structures were measured, these are summarized in Table 2. The four a-helices already described (Andersen et al., 1991) are the scaffold of the structure, helix Al (residues Ala3 to LeulB) is followed by helix A2 (residues Ala20 to Va136), which runs anti-parallel

to helix Al. In the peptide backbone of the residues (Gly37 to Lys50) between helix A2 and helix A3 the six residues between Pro44 and Phe49 are not well defined. The peptide, however, has the length required to make helix A3 (residues Gly51 to Glu60) run roughly parallel with helix A2. Helix A3 is followed by helix A4 (residues Ser65 to Gly85), which runs parallel to helix Al and anti-parallel to helix A2. Three turns were identified in the structure all between helix A3 and helix A4. They are

Tl (residues Trp58 to Leu61), turn T2 (residues Asn59 to Lys62) and turn T3 (residues Leu61 to Thr64). The slow hydrogen exchange of the amide hydrogen atoms observed for Leu61 and Thr64 (Andersen et al., 1991) is in agreement with these findings. No turn was identified with certainty in the sequence of four residues between Al and A2. Apart from the 42 hydrogen bonds identified by n.m.r., seven additional peptide backbone hydrogen bonds were present in the calculated structures. These were: 36 HN to 32 0, a regular extension of helix A2, 37 HN to 32 0, an irregular extension of this helix, 61 HN to 58 0, 62 HN to 59 0 and 64 HN to 61 0, defining the three turns between helix A3 and helix A4, and finally at the N-terminal part of

helix A4 the bonds 69 HN to 65 0 and 76 HN to 66 0 formed a regular extension of this helix. Helix Al is a typical amphipathic helix as seen in Figure 6(a) with residues Phe5, Ala8, Ala9 and Va112 being the interior non-polar side of the helix and residues Glu7, LyslO and His14 the polar sidechains that form one edge of the disc shaped structure. The a-amino group of Lysl3 is one of two amino groups on the otherwise hydrophobic surface. Helix A2 (Fig. 6(b)) is a central helix in the structure. The N-terminal part of the helix consists of three negatively charged residues Asp21, Glu22 and Glu23. The middle part of the helix is mixed with regard to polarity. One side has the residues Tyr28, Tyr31 and Lys32, the other side residues

Phe26, Ser29 and His30. The residues of this helix form contacts with residues of the other three

helices. At the same time the helix has residues present on the surface of each of the sides, respectively, of the molecule.

Helix A3 (Fig. 6(c)) is the shortest of the three helices, it also contains the two tryptophan residues of the protein. The helix has three positively charged residues in the N-terminal part, two of these seem to interact with the negatively charged residues on the N-terminal part of helix A2. Both the tryptophan residues (Trp55 and Trp58) are involved in interactions with Ile39 which is "sandwiched" between the two. Trp58 interacts with Tyr28 in helix A2 and Trp55 interacts with Arg43 in the middle of the loop region. Helix A4 (Fig. 6(d)) is the longest of the helices in the protein. Like helix -41 it is a typical amphipathic helix with residues Met70, Tyr73, Ile74, Va177, Leu80 and Tyr84 at one side of the helix and Asp68, Lys71, Asp75, Glu78, Glu79, Lys81, Lys82 and Lys83 on the other side of the helix. The global fold of rACBP is shown in Figure 7 and in Figure 8. The folding of the protein is determined by hydrophobic interactions between residues in all four helices. Helix Al, helix A2 and helix A4 are organized primarily by the interaction of three aromatic residues Phe5 of Al, Tyr31 in A2 and Tyr73 in A4. Tyr31 is also engaged in the interaction between helix A2 and helix A3 in an arrangement where the aliphatic part of Lys32 is sandwiched between the aromatic rings of Tyr28, Tyr31, Trp58 and Va136. Several aliphatic sidechains are framing this hydrophobic arrangement. These are Ala8, Ala9, Va112, Leu15, Ile27, Thr35, Ile74, Va177 and Leu80. At the N-terminal end of helix A3 tw o 1ysine residues, Lys50 and Lys54, bridge the gap to Asp21 at the N-terminal end of helix A2 suggesting a double salt-bridge between the two helices. The shape of the structure is reminiscent of a shallow bowl, and in this respect a top view of the molecule is shown in Figures 7 and 8. A hydrophobic cluster of residues of the protein surface is placed in the bottom part of the inner surface of the "shallow bowl" whereas the rim and upper outside

surface is characterized by a large number of charged residues, consisting in particular of polar residues from the hydrophilic residues of helices Al and A4 and the N-terminal parts of helices A2 and A3. On the inside bottom facing the viewer there are, in the otherwise hydrophobic environment, two lysine residues, Lysl3 and Lys32, whose a-amino groups are the only potentially charged residues there. On the outside bottom surface there is one potentially charged residue, HisSO. Both the inside and the outside bottom surfaces have uncharged polar groups like the hydroxyl groups of serine, threonine and tyrosyl side-chains. However, the n.m.r. studies suggest that the hydroxyl hydrogen atoms in Ser29, Thr35 and Thr64, whose resonances were clearly observed and assigned in the spectra (Andersen et al., 1991) are in relatively slow exchange with solvent and therefore probably hydrogen-bonded. An examination of the structures revealed that the HY' atoms of Ser29, Thr35 and Thr64 can form a hydrogen bond with the 0 of Leu25, Tyr31 and Leu61, respectively. An examination of the distribution of the hydrophilic groups on the "rim of the bowl" shows that in particular (given the view in Fig. 7) the right part of the molecule formed by the polar sides of the helices Al and A4 and the N-terminal part of A2 and A3 is very polar, whereas the lower and left part of the edge is less polar. In the top left part of the rim Leu47 and Phe49 are two non-polar residues right on the surface of the molecule. An examination of the n.m.r. spectra suggests unambiguously that these residues have no contacts with any other part of the molecule. In other words these two non-polar residues are apparently fully exposed at the surface of the molecule.
4. Discussion

The structure determination of rACBP has been obtained with an input of 833 distance and 87 angle restraints and in the final step an additional 84 distance restraints describing back-bone hydrogen bonds were included. In the final set of 20 structures there was one structure with one distance violation larger than 65 A. The r.m.s.d. between the calculated and the target inter-proton distance restraint,s

was 0*044( -&0002) A, the NOE restraint energy was 009 kcal/mol distance restraint per (1 cal= 4184 J) and the torsion angle restraint energy was 00004 kcal per mol per torsion angle restraint. The atomic r.m.s.d. when compared to the geometric average structure was @5 i% for the backbone atoms in the four a-helices and 1-OA for the backbone atoms in all residues. This summary of the structure determination of rACBP from distance and angle restraints obtained from n.m.r. measurements clearly indicate that the structure is both precisely and accurately determined for a major part of the structure. The number of structural restraints used in the structure determination is large given the size of the protein, however, the distribution of these on residues, as was shown in Figure 1, is uneven with a considerable number of restraints observed for a relatively small proportion of residues, typically of tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine. This has been important for the definition of the global fold of the protein because it has fixed most precisely the orientation of the four a-helices with respect to each other. The only chemical difference between ACBP and rACBP is the missing N-acetyl group in the latter. It has been of some interest to examine the difference between the two molecules. In our previous study of the assignment of ACBP and rACBP `H n.m.r. spectra (Andersen et aE., 1991) we noted that there were very few differences between the two molecules. This suggests that the two molecules indeed have very similar structures over all. With the three-dimensional structure determined of rACBP it is of interest to examine in structural terms the location of the atoms with differences in chemical shifts between the two molecules. The local changes due to the additional positive charge in rACBP seem to result in disruption of the N-terminal part of helix Al, which in ACBP seems to start at residue 1, whereas in rACBP it starts at Ala3. This clearly affects the chemical shifts of the HN resonances of residues 3 to 9 in the N-terminal part of the helix. Other resonances affected were from HN protons on residues in the N-terminal of helix A4, which is physically close to the N-terminal of the molecule. A qualitative comparison of the NOESY spectra of the two molecules revealed that they were mostly similar. Therefore, we could conclude that the structural differences between the two molecules are localized in the region of the molecule where the chemical difference is. Although the structure of rACBP consist of four a-helices, the structural topology is not a real fourhelix bundle as described by Presnell t Cohen (1989). The topology has a certain resemblance to the left-handed anti-parallel type bundle, with helices Al and A4 running in pairs parallel to helices A2 and A3, and helix A2 running anti-parallel to Al and A4. However, because helix A3 only interacts with residues of helix A2 and not with the two others the requirements for this topology are not, present.

We have examined the four helices for ideality. Essentially, all the requirements for a-helix configurations were observed in the n.m.r. data both with respect to the sequential NOES expected and with respect to the coupling constants 3J,,NH.. In a few cases though, we have observed non-ideal parameters for a-helices in the data. The coupling constants for Hisl4, in helix Al, Thr35 and Va136 in helix A2, and Tyr84 in helix A4 were all measured to be larger than 7 Hz suggesting the &angle in these residues to be outside the typical range for residues in a-helices. Accordingly the restraint limits for the &angle in the corresponding residues were set to cover the range -80" to - 160' in the structure calculations. In the resulting structures the four $-angles fall clearly outside the range of typical helices (Fig. 4(a)). Nevertheless, the backbones of the four residues remain an integral part of their respective helices with negative $-angles (Fig. 4(b)), and form typical hydrogen bonds in all cases even when the structure calculations did not apply the restraints for hydrogen bonds. We note that these deviations from normality in the helices all occurred in the C-terminal part of the respective helices. In the &$-plot (Fig. 5), we note that by far the majority of the $-$-combinations are well within the so called allowed regions. However, in one case, Glu42, the average &angle is positive, 74" +75". This reflects the fact that no &angle restraints were applied for this residue, and as a result of this a number of structures were seen to have Glu42 with positive &angles. The n.m.r. data for this residue are sparse, there are only a few NOES and the 3JHNH. could not be measured accurately. The data do not suggest that the &angle is positive, rather that the residue is mobile or close to a mobile environment in the structure. The apparent vertical lines in this plot arise from four residues, Ala3, Met46, Leu47 and Phe49, these were all constrained accor@g to their small 3JHNH. coupling constants. However, they are all in regions of the protein that are not sufficiently restrained to give a well determined structure. In the process of structure calculations the structures were calculated without application of the hydrogen bonds that could be derived from the secondary structure determination, using only the restraints obtained from angle and distance coupling constants and NOES, respectively. The structures obtained were practically identical to the structures presented here, with the exception that two hydrogen bonds, one from Ala8 to Glu4 in the N-terminal helix Al, and one from Glu79 to Asp75 in the middle of the C-terminal helix A4 were not formed and as a result these helices were bent. As, however, we had all indications that these hydrogen bonds were present from the sequential NOES, in particular the Glu79-Asp75 hydrogen bond because the amide exchange of HN in Glu79 was found to be slow (Andersen et al., 1991), it was decided to use this information by introducing a final step in the structure calculation of restrained dynamics with all the hydrogen bond restraints obtained from the

Three-dimensional determination of the secondary structure (Andersen et al., 1991). The ultimate purpose of this work is to determine the structure of the protein-ligand complex. This study is aimed at identifying the interaction sites between the ligand acyl-coenzyme A and the protein. Although the present work has primarily been to determine the three-dimensional structure of the protein itself this has nevertheless provided a structural outline that has allowed us to suggest the localization of the binding site for the ligand. Given that the structure could be described as a shallow bowl on which the rim is hydrophilic and both the inside and outside bottom is predominantly nonpolar, and given that on the inside surface we have identified two lysine residues, Lysl3 and Lys32, well fixed in the non-polar surface, we suggest that the inner surface of the shallow bowl could be the ligand binding site and the two positively charged amino
groups could well be the counter ions to the nega-

The ACBP, rACBP and the i5N enriched rACBP were prepared by Dr Jens Knudsen, Birthe Kragelund and colleagues (Department of Biochemistry, Odense University), we are grateful for their collaboration, help and many useful discussions. We wish to thank Mogens Kjrer, Svend Ludvigsen and Jens Chr. Madsen for useful discussions and help with the data recording and the computational aspects of the work. Flemming M. Poulsen is a member of the Danish Protein Engineering Center, (PERC).
