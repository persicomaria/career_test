A series of 2-(3-thienyl)-5,6-dihydroxypyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid inhibitors of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase enzyme are reported. Sulfonyl urea substituted analogs in this series proved to be the most potent active site non-nucleoside inhibitors of NS5B reported to date. These compounds had low nanomolar enzyme inhibition across HCV genotypes 1­3 and showed single digit micromolar inhibition in the HCV replicon assay. This improved cell-based activity allowed the binding mode of these compounds to be probed by selection of resistant mutations against compound 21. The results generated are in broad agreement with the previously proposed binding model for this compound class. Ó 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Around 2% of the world's population is infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and at risk of developing serious liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.1 HCV is a leading indication for liver transplantation and is thought to lead to around 10,000 deaths annually in the United States alone.2 The current standard of care for HCV, which is based on a combination of interferon-a and ribavarin, can cure HCV infections, but is often inadequate. In addition to serious side effects such as fatigue, flu-like symptoms, and hemolytic anemia3 interferon-based therapy also has a low success rate (<50%) in the main viral genotype.4 The need for improved therapies is pressing because although the incidence of new HCV infections is declining, mortality is expected to increase into the middle the next decade.5 The HCV genome is highly variable in sequence with six main genotypes that are encoded by (+)-stranded RNA's containing around 9.6 kilobases.6 Translation of the viral genome in hepatocytes and post-translational processing events liberate six non-structural (NS) proteins that comprise the viral replication machinery. The NS5B enzyme is one of these proteins, and has been identified as an RNA dependent RNA polymerase. NS5B is essential for replication since it both effects the synthesis of a (À)-stranded HCV RNA template and regenerates the (+)-stranded genomic RNA.7 The NS5B active site is located in the palm domain of the enzyme where two conserved aspartic acid residues chelate a pair of Mg2+ ions that catalyze the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. The Mg2+ ions have the dual role of activating the 30 -OH of the elongating RNA chain for nucleophilic attack, and stabilizing the

pyrophosphate leaving group on the incoming nucleoside triphosphate. The HCV polymerase enzyme is seen as an attractive target for drug intervention because of its fundamental role in viral replication. Clinical proof-of-concept for antivirals operating through an allosteric mechanism of action has now been demonstrated for several classes of NS5B inhibitors.8 However, allosteric compounds typically have genotype sensitivities that can result in drastically reduced effectiveness against HCV from genotypes 2 or 3.9 To date, clinical reductions in HCV viral load from allosteric compounds has been limited to patients infected with genotype 1 HCV.10 In contrast, the highly conserved active site of NS5B favors the development of inhibitors that are active across genotypes. Active site nucleoside inhibitors such as R7128 have shown comparably strong clinical effects in patients infected with all three of the main HCV genotypes (genotypes 1­3).11 Despite the attraction of the active site with a view to identifying pan-genotype inhibitors, very few series of non-nucleoside inhibitors have been reported. 5,6Dihydroxypyrimidine-4-carboxylic acids (e.g., 1) that evolved from a diketoacid lead12 are the most promising active site nonnucleosides reported to date. Our earlier work in this area (Fig. 1) demonstrated that replacement of the C2 phenyl group in 1 with five-membered ring heterocycles (such as 2-thiophene, 2) improved biochemical potency by an order of magnitude.13 Optimization of 2 led to the 30 -substituted thiophene 3 that shows good NS5B enzyme inhibition (IC50 158 nM) but has poor activity in the cell-based HCV replicon assay (EC50 10.9 lM).14 In a continuation of our pursuit for active-site inhibitors with improved potency we describe here our work in a related series of 3-thiophene substituted 5,6-dihydroxypyrimidine-4-carboxylic acids.

tion to more than 10-fold improved biochemical potency, this series provided for the first time active-site non-nucleoside inhibitors that are sufficiently active in the replicon system to allow the study of resistance to this compound class. 2-(3-Thienyl)-5,6-dihydroxypyrimidine-4-carboxylic acids were prepared following literature precedent as outlined in Scheme 1.14 Thus amidoximes 5a­d (available from the corresponding carbonitriles 4a­d) were condensed with dimethyl acetylene dicarboxylate and the resulting adducts were cyclized under thermal conditions. Routine hydrolysis of the pyrimidine methyl esters 6a­d furnished the target inhibitors 7­10. Based on previous work14 structure­activity investigations at the 20 - and 40 -position of 3-thiophene 7 were of interest. However, the free amine from N-Cbz deprotection of 6d proved to be unstable, and compound 10 was the only 20 -substituted 3-thiophene evaluated. In contrast, removal of the N-Boc protecting group from 6b (Scheme 2) afforded the free 40 -aminothiophene 11 that reacted smoothly with electrophiles. Thus treatment of 11 with 2-chlorobenzoic acid and N,N0 -carbonyldiimidazole followed by saponification gave the amide 12. Ureas 13­14 were prepared in the same fashion through reaction of 11 with the appropriate benzyl isocyanates. Sulfonyl ureas 15­24 were obtained from commercial sulfonyl isocyanates or with ethyl sulfonyl carbamates (that were prepared by treatment of the corresponding aryl sulfonamides with ethyl chloroformate). Table 1 summarises our initial exploration of 3-thiophene substituted 5,6-dihydroxypyrimidine-4-carboxylic acids. In line with results for the isomeric 2-thiophene analog 2, compound 7 (IC50 6.1 lM) had improved potency with respect to our original phenyl substituted lead 1 (IC50 30 lM).14 This is thought to stem from acidification of the pyrimidine 5-OH group when five-membered ring heterocycles are present at the pyrimidone C-2 position, an effect believed to favorably influence Mg2+ chelation in the

NS5B active site. The greater improvement for the 2-thiophene compound is in line with the somewhat stronger electron withdrawing effect for this isomer.15 Structure­activity relationships at the 40 -position of the thiophene ring of 7 proved to be somewhat changed with respect to those at the 30 -position of 2-thiophene 2. An example was the 2-chlorobenzyl amide 12 which brought only a modest improvement in potency over 7 (rather than the order of magnitude gain seen in the isomeric 2-thiophene series). The benzyl carbamoyl substituted 9, as well as its 20 -isomer 10, each improved potency by around 20-fold with respect to the unsubstituted analog 7. In contrast, no gain in potency came from the simple alkyl carbamate in 8. Benzyl ureas, which had given the most active inhibitors in the 2-thiophene series (i.e., 3) were extensively explored in the 3-thiophene area. Although gains in potency were achieved with respect to the simple benzyl urea 13 (IC50 873 nM) they were consistently modest; the 2-chlorobenzyl urea 14 again was optimal (IC50 258 nM). More notable improvements in potency came from introduction of a sulfonyl urea group at the 40 -position of thiophene 7 (Table 2). The phenyl sulfonyl urea 15 was around 100-fold more active than 7, and was also the first compound in this regioisomeric thiophene series to show cell-based activity (EC50 32 ± 12 lM). Efforts to

further improve the sulfonyl urea compounds focused on changes to the phenyl ring in the thiophene side-chain of 15. The introduction of substituents at the ortho-position gave analogs 16­18 that, despite similar biochemical potency to 15, had improved cellbased activities. In particular, the halogenated compounds 16 and 18 had efficacy in the replicon assay that was improved by around an order of magnitude. In contrast, compounds with a halogen substituent at the 3- or 4-positions of the phenyl ring (19­20) did not bring any improvement over 15. 2,3-Disubstituted aromatic rings such as the 1-naphthyl derivative 21 or the 2,3-dichloro compound 23 were the most active inhibitors in this study. Both these compounds are low nanomolar inhibitors of

the NS5B enzyme and show low micromolar inhibition in the cell-based assay.16 The importance of the position of the substituents on the phenyl ring was again apparent from the 2-naphthyl compound 22 that had much weaker cell based activity than its isomer 21.17 The improvement of inhibition observed for compounds with a sulfonyl urea side chain was thought likely to be related to the acidity of this group. This was confirmed by preparation of the methyl sulfonyl urea 24 that was 14-fold more active than the unsubstituted thiophene 7. Potency gains of this magnitude are not achieved when alkyl groups are attached to a thiophene through non-acidic linkers; the tert-butylcarbamate 8 is one such example. In line with our expectation that inhibitors targeting the highly conserved active site should block HCV replication for all viral genotypes, compound 21 displayed potent inhibition against NS5B isolates from all three of the major HCV genotypes. Thus 21 showed potent activity against the DC21 NS5B enzymes from genotype 1b (IC50 5.6 nM), 2a (IC50 2.1 nM), 2b (IC50 5.8 nM) and 3a (IC50 3.9 nM). Blockade of HCV in HUH-7 cells stably transfected with HCV RNA from the 2b genotype was also observed (EC50 9.6 lM) and cell-based activity was confirmed (for 21, 16 and 23) in a full-length genotype 2a infectivity assay (Table 2). Following intravenous administration of compound 21 (3 mg/kg) to rat, an excellent plasma half life (t1/2 = 15 h) was measured; this reflects the expected low volume of distribution (0.1 L/kg) and turnover (0.2 mL/min/kg) for this acidic compound that is highly bound to rat serum proteins (>99%). Oral exposure (3 mg/kg) was 3.3 lM h and though oral bioavailability was low (%Fp.o. = 2), high levels of systemic exposure could be achieved through intramuscular administration of the compound (%Fi.m. = 89). Under a modification to the replicon assay protocol, cell survival in response to antibiotic neomycin sulfate can be tied to HCV replication by incorporation of a neomycin phosphotransferase gene into the HCV RNA.18 Efficient suppression of HCV replication, as expected by inhibition of NS5B, sensitizes cells to antibiotic and links cell survival to the development of escape mutations that restore replication competency. These characteristics have been exploited for the selection of cell colonies resistant to compound 21 from the current series. Sequencing of the HCV genomes in the surviving

colonies revealed two specific mutations in the NS5B region, P156S and G152E, each of which was demonstrated by reverse genetics sufficient to confer resistance to 21. Thus when compound 21 was tested in HUH-7 cells transfected with sub-genomic HCV RNA harboring either mutation G152E or P156S, it showed at least a six-fold loss in activity. Compound 21, as well as the related sulfonyl urea 18, the urea 3 and the simple pyrimidone 25 were also tested against an isolated HCV NS5B enzyme containing either the P156S or G152E mutations. The results in Table 3 illustrate that sulfonyl ureas 21 and 18 as well as 3 all showed significant impairment of activity against the G152E mutant with IC50 values between five and eightfold reduced with respect to wild-type. In contrast, compound 25 (which has an unsubstituted thiophene ring) showed no decrease in response suggesting a role for the thiophene side-chain in conferring resistance. The loss of cell-based activity against P156S that had been seen in a cell-based setting was not recapitulated when this mutation was incorporated into a genotype 1b DC55 NS5B enzyme. Apparently the interaction between 21 and NS5B in the context of a cell-based replication complex is not fully recaptured in the in-vitro assay.19

In large part the resistance data observed are consistent with the binding model that we previously proposed for these active site inhibitors. In the C6/N1 amide tautomer (that has been found to have low ground state energy, and which preliminary SAR suggested may be the active species) the conformation of the sulfonylurea side chain would be dictated by an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the 3-NH group on the thiophene ring and the N3 atom of the pyrimidone. Modeling of 18 into the pyrophosphate binding region of the NS5B active site in this planar orientation (Fig. 2) highlights contacts between the sulfonylurea side chain and both the P156 and particularly the G152 residues. In light of the above considerations it became clear that compound 26 (Fig. 3) was an attractive target since it constrains both the side-chain orientation and pyrimidone tautomerism in our proposed binding model. Unlike the N-methylpyrimidone 27, the ring constrained analog 26 ought to have a conformation in which the thiophene and pyrimidone rings are approximately coplanar. The change of side chain orientation for N-methyl compounds such as 27 is thought to explain their reduced inhibition; compound 27 (IC50 600 nM) is an 8-fold weaker inhibitor than 16. Compound 27 was prepared as outlined in Scheme 3. Regioselective deprotonation of the thiophene 4b (LDA, À78 °C) followed by alkylation with TBS protected 1,2-iodoethanol furnished 29, albeit in modest yield. This compound was elaborated as previously described to the pyrimidine 31. Protection of the pyrimidine 5-OH as a pivaloate ester followed by TBS deprotection of the primary alcohol set up the cyclization step that was smoothly effected (50% yield) under Mitsunobu-conditions. Compound 33 was elaborated to the target

inhibitor by removal of the pivaloate and N-Boc protecting groups followed by installation of the side chain using 2-chlorophenylsulfonyl isocyanate; the synthesis was completed by methyl ester hydrolysis to give 26. Compound 26 was tested against the genotype 1b NS5B enzyme which it proved to have extremely weak potency (IC50 10 lM). This result was somewhat contrary to our expectation based on the structure activity relationships and modeling hypotheses generated across several series of inhibitor. A simple explanation may be that there is insufficient space to accommodate the newly formed six-membered ring that has been installed into the inhibitor in 26. However, this result may alternatively point to the importance of an alternative binding orientation, in which a 180° rotation occurs about the thiophene­pyrimidine bond (such as is constrained in compound 28). In summary, we have described a series of active site inhibitors of NS5B that achieved around a 15-fold improvement in biochemical potency over our previous work. Strong enzyme inhibition (c. 5 nM) was achieved against DC21 NS5B from HCV genotypes 1­3 and cell-based efficacy was improved to a level that for the first time allowed resistance to this compound class to be assessed. Mutation at either of residues P156 and G152 in NS5B was found sufficient to confer resistance to sulfonylurea 21, and compounds 3 and 18 showed cross-resistance. The binding model previously proposed for 5,6-dihydroxypyrimidine-4-carboxylic acids was supported by resistance data, but the weak inhibitor 26 (which was designed based upon this model) highlights that further studies are required to fully understand the interaction of this compound class at the active site.
