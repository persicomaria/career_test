Abstract This is a review of recent work on methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), a pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-containing enzyme catalysing the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde in methylotrophic bacteria. Although it is the most extensively studied of this class of dehydrogenases, it is only recently that there has been any consensus about its mechanism. This is partly due to recent structural studies on normal and mutant enzymes and partly due to more definitive work on the mechanism of related alcohol and glucose dehydrogenases. This work has also led to conclusions about the subsequent path of electrons and protons during the reoxidation of the reduced quinol form of the prosthetic group. D 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction This article is a brief review of the structure and function of methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), a soluble quinoprotein whose prosthetic group is pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) (for reviews, see Refs. [1­ 5]). It catalyses the first reaction in an unusual periplasmic electron transport chain responsible for oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde in methylotrophic bacteria [6,7]: MeOH ! MDH ! cytochrome cL ! cytochrome cH ! oxidase ! oxygen Although MDH is the most extensively studied of this class of dehydrogenases, it is only very recently that there has been any consensus about its mechanism. This consensus is partly due to recent structural studies on normal and mutant enzymes and partly due to more definitive work on the mechanism of related alcohol and glucose dehydrogenases (for review, see Ref. [8]). The structural work on

MDH and related quinohemoproteins has also led to conclusions about the subsequent path of electrons and protons during the reoxidation of the reduced quinol form of the prosthetic group.

2. The structure of MDH The X-ray structure has been determined for the MDH from Methylobacterium extorquens [4,9 ­11] and Methylophilus sp. [12 ­16]. MDH has an a2h2 tetrameric structure; each a subunit (66 kDa) contains one molecule of PQQ and one Ca2 + ion. The h subunit is very small (8.5 kDa) and folds around the a-subunit; it cannot be reversibly dissociated, its function is unknown and it is not present in any other quinoproteins. The large a subunit has a propeller fold making up a superbarrel of eight radially arranged h-sheets (the `propeller blades') (Fig. 1). The PQQ is sandwiched between the indole ring of a co-planar tryptophan residue and an unusual eight-membered disulfide ring structure formed from adjacent cysteine residues, joined by an atypical non-planar peptide bond. It might be expected that this unique structure would have some special biological function but this function has not been unequivocally defined. Site-directed mutagenesis of either or both of the cysteine residues (Cys103, Cys104) to serine led to production of only small amounts of MDH in M. extorquens and

this MDH had no activity [11]. Reduction of the disulfide bond is exceptionally rapid, leading to loss of activity, but reoxidation in air or carboxymethylation of the free thiols leads to return of activity [17]. That the carboxymethylated derivative is active rules out the possibility that the reduction of disulfide to free thiols is an important feature of the catalytic cycle. The disulfide ring is not present in the quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase in which electrons are transferred to membrane ubiquinone from the quinol PQQH2, and in which the semiquinone free radical is unlikely to be involved as a stable intermediate. It is possible, therefore, that this novel structure might function in the stabilization of the free radical PQQ semiquinone or its protection from solvent at the entrance to the active site in MDH [9,17]. Recent work with the quinohemoprotein (Type II) alcohol dehydrogenase suggests, however, that, although it does not become completely reduced, the disulfide ring is essential for intra-protein electron transfer in all the alcohol dehydrogenases [18]. The active site contains a single Ca2 + ion whose coordination sphere contains PQQ and protein atoms, including both oxygens of the carboxylate of Glu177 and the amide oxygen of Asn261 (Fig. 2). The PQQ atoms include the C5 quinone oxygen, one oxygen of the C7 carboxylate and, ° surprisingly, the N6 ring atom which is only 2.45 A from the metal ion (Fig. 2). The C4 and C5 oxygen atoms, which become reduced during the catalytic cycle, are hydrogen bonded to Arg331, which also makes hydrogen bonds between its NH2 and the carboxylate of Asp303, which is

the most likely candidate for the base required by the catalytic mechanism.

3. The mechanism of MDH MDH catalyses a Ping-Pong reaction, consistent with the reduction of PQQ by methanol and the release of formaldehyde, followed by two sequential single-electron transfers to the cytochrome cL, during which the PQQH2 is oxidised back to the quinone by way of the free radical semiquinone (Fig. 3). The rate-limiting step is the breaking of the methyl C ­ H bond which leads to a large deuterium isotope effect, and it is this step that is affected by the unexplained activation by ammonia [19,20,3,11]. The first step in the reaction mechanism is likely to be the abstraction of the proton from the alcohol group by an active site base, proposed to be Asp303 (Figs. 2­ 4). This proposal is supported by the properties of a modified MDH in which this aspartate was replaced by glutamate by sitedirected mutagenesis [11]. In the mechanisms described in Figs. 3 and 4 the Ca2 + ion acts as a Lewis acid by way of its coordination to the C5 carbonyl oxygen of PQQ, thus stabilising the electrophilic C5 for attack by the oxyanion (Fig. 3) or hydride (Fig. 4). In addition to the Ca2 + ion, the conserved arginine (Arg331) is also likely to be important in increasing the nucleophilicity of the C5 atom of PQQ. The C5 carbonyl of isolated PQQ is very reactive towards nucleophilic reagents, leading to the conclusion that a covalent PQQ ­ substrate complex (a hemiketal) may be involved [21] and, until recently, the balance of opinion has tended to be in favour of this addition/elimination mechanism (Fig. 3). The alternative proposal involves the same initial proton abstraction, but this is followed by a direct hydride transfer from the methyl group of methanol to

the C5 of PQQ [1 ­3,5]. The evidence is strongly in favour of this hydride transfer mechanism in the case of the soluble glucose dehydrogenase [22,23] and in the more closely related Type II alcohol dehydrogenase [18,24], and it has been argued that it is very likely that all these quinoprotein dehydrogenases have the same mechanism [8]. It has been pointed out [8] that the nonenzymic model studies that gave

apparent support for the addition/elimination mechanism (for example, see Ref. [25]) were carried out in acetonitrile (MeCN) and that conclusions from these studies cannot necessarily be transferred to the enzymic situation. A recent study of MDH showed a structure in which the PQQ is in the reduced form, with the C5 carrying a hydroxyl group (structure [3] in Fig. 4) [16] and a similar structure was

Fig. 5. The change in the active site of MDH in which the proposed active site base (Asp303) has been altered by site-directed mutagenesis to a glutamate [11]. Key differences are the heptacoordinate Ca2 + in the D303E-MDH due to a new coordination to the carboxyl of the Glu303; formation of a new hydrogen bond between OE1 of Glu303 and the O5 of PQQ; and the eradication of bonding of this carboxylate with Asn261 and Arg331. This structure is not consistent with the mechanism summarised in Fig. 3, but it is consistent with the direct hydride transfer mechanism (Fig. 4).

inferred from the X-ray structure of a mutant MDH in which Asp303 was changed by site-directed mutagenesis to a glutamate [11] (Fig. 5). In the X-ray structure of this MDH the Glu303 was able to form a hydrogen bond with the O5 oxygen of PQQ, which would only be possible if there is a hydroxyl in this position. This structure is not an intermediate in the addition/elimination mechanism (Fig. 3). Both of these studies lend considerable support to the conclusion that the mechanism of MDH is the direct hydride transfer mechanism. The position of the substrate in the active site has not been determined. The hydroxyl of the methanol must necessarily be near enough to be hydrogen bonded to the side chain of Asp303 (the proposed active site base), and the methyl group must be near to the C5 of PQQ and within the hydrophobic cavity bounded by side chains of Trp265, Trp540 and Leu556 as well as the disulfide ring. This raises the problem that MDH has a broad substrate specificity and can oxidise a wide range of primary alcohols including relatively large substrates such as pentanol and cinnamyl alcohol; it is not immediately obvious how these substrates could readily gain access to the active site, and understanding of this awaits solution of a structure containing one of these larger substrates.

The pathways of electron and proton transfer in methanol dehydrogenase During the reoxidation of the reduced quinol form of PQQ (structure [5], Fig. 4), the electrons are passed one at a time to the cytochrome cL, which is bound by carboxylate residues to lysyl residues on MDH [7].

MDH surface [26]. No structure of the MDH/cytochrome cL complex is available but it is reasonable to conclude that electrons pass by the shortest route from the reduced PQQ to the heme of the bound cytochrome cL. This route is likely to be similar to that calculated for electrons in the Type II quinohemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase (QH-ADH) in which the cytochrome is `built into' the enzyme, and the constraints in such pathways are fully discussed in the QHADH papers [18,24]. Based on the QH-ADH calculations and the similar structure of MDH, the shortest electron transfer route is likely to be the one involving the conserved disulfide ring, Asp105 and Asn52 and water molecules (Fig. 6). During the reoxidation of reduced PQQ the protons from the quinol must be released into the periplasm, and this is likely to be by way of a similar hydrogen bonded network of proton donor and acceptor groups, as has been shown in QH-ADH [18] involving amino acid side chains (Asp303, Arg331, Glu177) and a channel of water molecules leading out from the active site into the periplasm (Fig. 6). When measured with pure MDH and cytochrome cL, the rates of electron transfer between the proteins are very slow [11,27­ 29]. Part of the reaction (the reduction of PQQ by methanol) is rapid when activated (at pH 9) by ammonia, but this step is very slow at pH 7, the physiological pH at which the ferricytochrome cL is an excellent oxidant. It has therefore been assumed that, in addition to MDH, other proteins or co-factors may be involved in electron transfer between methanol and cytochrome cL, perhaps leading to activation of the first rate-limiting step at physiological pH values. A small, oxygen-labile factor that appeared to increase the rate of electron transfer has been described [28] but this does not appear to have been further investigated. That other proteins or cofactors are probably involved is also indicated by the observation that the operon coding for the two subunits of MDH and also for cytochrome cL includes other genes, such as mxaJ and mxaD [30 ­32]. There has been a report that the protein encoded by mxaJ may be a third subunit of MDH in one methylotroph [33] but this has not yet been confirmed in other systems. Preliminary observation of the mxaD mutant of M. extorquens has indicated that the mxaD protein is also somehow involved in electron transfer from MDH [34].
