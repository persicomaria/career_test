ABSTRACT The crystal structure of alkaline liquefying a-amylase (AmyK) from the alkaliphilic ° Bacillus sp. KSM-1378 was determined at 2.1 A resolution. The AmyK structure belongs to the GH13 glycoside hydrolase family, which consists of three domains, and bound three calcium and one sodium ions. The alkaline adaptation mechanism of AmyK was investigated by the ancestral sequence evolutionary trace method and by extensive comparisons between alkaline and nonalkaline enzyme structures, including three other protein families: protease, cellulase, and phosphoserine aminotransferase. The consensus change for the alkaline adaptation process was a decrease in the Lys content. The loss of a Lys residue is associated with ion pair remodeling, which mainly consists of the loss of Lys­Asp/Glu ion pairs and the acquisition of Arg ion pairs, preferably Arg­Glu. The predicted replacements of the positively charged amino acids were often, although not always, used for ion pair remodeling. Proteins C 2007;66:600­610. V 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words: detergent enzyme; alkaliphile; protein evolution; structural bioinformatics INTRODUCTION Alkaline enzymes have a long history as the detergent additives.1­3 Proteases, lipases, cellulases, and amylases are used in laundry detergents in order to digest stains or treat textures.4,5 Recently, the widespread use of automatic dishwashing machines has prompted the new application of the starch digesting enzymes, mainly a-amylases, to laundry and dishwashing detergents. High-durability under alkaline conditions containing detergent ingredients, such as surfactants, chelating reagents, and oxidative bleaches, is required for detergent enzymes. Therefore, most of the currently used enzymes have been extracted from alkaliphilic microorganisms.4,5 Suitable alkaline enzymes for detergent additives were investigated among the alkaliphilic bacteria, and Bacillus sp.

a-amylase AmyK (1,4-a-D-glucan glucanohydrolase; EC 3.2.1.1). AmyK belongs to the family-13 glycoside hydrolases (GH13),6 and it shows optimal enzymatic activity at pH 8.0.7 This enzyme has significantly higher activity under alkaline conditions when compared with the amylases previously used for laundry additives, such as those from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens,8 Bacillus stearothermophilus,9 and Bacillus licheniformis.10 AmyK demonstrated higher relative activity against starch, amylose, and glycogen when compared with the other industrial amylases, especially around pH 9.7 This alkaliphilic nature, along with its high-durability in several surfactants, made AmyK suitable as a detergent additive. Although alkaline adaptation is one of the important properties of industrial enzymes, its molecular basis has not been studied sufficiently, in comparison with that of protein thermostability. Since inside of the cells of alkaliphilic microorganism is maintained at near neutral pH, only extracellular proteins have been adapted to alkaline conditions.11 This fact restricts the number of proteins that can be used for analyses of protein alkaline adaptation. The previous crystal structure analyses of an alkaline protease and a cellulase of Bacillus species, together with the molecular phylogeny-aided investigations of their evolutionary process, have led to a proposed alkaline

adaptation mechanism for these enzymes.12,13 The loss of Lys and Asp residues and the acquisition of Arg and His residues were found to occur in the evolutionary process of alkaline adaptation. This amino acid replacement pattern decreased the number of Lys­Asp ion pairs in the protein molecules. The loss of the Lys­Asp pairs seemed to be compensated by the acquisition of Arg ion pairs. Since arginines generally have higher pKa values than lysine, this observation was thought to be relevant to the alkaline adaptation of the enzymes. It was experimentally demonstrated that the replacement of the surface residues of Trichoderma reesei endo-1,4-b-xylanase II with Arg resulted in an alkaline shift of the optimum pH of the enzymatic activity.14 Recently, X-ray crystallographic analyses of two phosphoserine aminotransferases from Bacillus alcalophilus and B. circulans subsp. alkalophilus at atomic resolution were reported.15 Based on the comparisons of the alkaline enzyme structures with those of the nonalkaline homologue from Escherichia coli, increased numbers of Hbonds and negatively charged amino acids on the molecular surface, enhanced hydrophobic interactions at the dimer interface, decreased molecular surface area, and fewer ion pairs on the molecular surface were proposed as the causes for the alkaline adaptation of the enzyme. Despite these efforts, a consistent view for the molecular bases of alkaline adaptation of proteins has not been obtained. To understand the alkaline adaptation mechanisms of AmyK, a promising detergent additive enzyme, ° its crystal structure was determined at a 2.1 A resolution. The adaptation process of the enzyme was extensively investigated by the ancestral sequence evolutionary trace method (abbreviated as ASET in subsequent sections) and by structural comparisons among the alkaline and nonalkaline homologues. In addition, three other families of alkaline enzymes, namely proteases, cellulases, and phosphoserine aminotransferases, were analyzed using the same criteria as for the amylases, to confirm the conclusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Preparation Recombinant AmyK was prepared as described previously.16 The pHSPAmyK construct, consisting of the hyperexpression vector pHSP64 (5.1 kb) and a 1.5-kb DNA fragment encoding amino acids Pro4 to Gln485 of AmyK, was introduced into Bacillus subtilis ISW1214 cells. Transformed cells were propagated in an optimized liquid medium (CSL broth) containing tetracycline (15 lg/ mL) at 308C for about 80 h. The recombinant AmyK was purified from the culture supernatant by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-Toyopearl 650M and CM-Toyopearl 650S columns (Tosoh). Crystallization and Crystallographic Analysis The AmyK crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. The initial conditions were 0.05M

The crystals were grown in 3­4 weeks at 48C to approximate maximum dimensions of 0.3 3 0.1 3 0.1 mm3. X-ray diffraction data of the crystal were collected using a DIP2030 imaging plate detector (Mac Science) with a mirror monochromator mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 cop° per-rotating anode X-ray generator (k ¼ 1.54 A) (Rigaku). The crystal was soaked in reservoir solution containing 15% (w/v) glycerol at 48C before flash-cooling in a liquidN2 bath. The crystals were kept in a 100 K dry-N2 stream (Rigaku) during data collection. The diffraction data were recorded on imaging plates, and were reduced by using the DENZO and SCALEPACK programs.17 The data collection statistics are summarized in Table I. The structure of the crystal was solved by the molecular replacement method, with B. licheniformis amylase (PDB code 1bli)18 as the search model, by using AMoRe.19 Crystallographic refinement was performed by CNS ver1.120 and TURBO-FRODO.21 The refinement statistics are also summarized in Table I.

Prot (Release 43) databases.23,24 Basically, the sequences with complete ORFs and without long disordered regions (if the 3D structure was known) that shared more than 25% identity with the alkaline enzymes (AmyK, 2die; Mprotease, 1wsd; CelK, 1g01; and phosphoserine aminotransferase from B. alcalophilus, 1w3u) were collected. The sequences were aligned by using the ClustalW program,25 and the alignment was manually refined on the XCED alignment editor.26 A total of 57 amylase, 66 protease, 53 cellulase, and 89 phosphoserine aminotransferase sequences were used to construct molecular phylogenies. The amino acid sequences of the following known structures were contained in the phylogenies: amylases: 2die (this work), 1ud3, 1wpc, 11vjs, 1ob0, 1bli, and 1e40; proteases: 1scd, 1wsd, 1st3, 1iav, 1ndu, 2tec, 1dbi, 1sbt, 1scj, 1mee; cellulases: 1g01, 1tvp, 1egz, 1w3l, and 1lf1; phosphoserine aminotransferases: 1w3u, 1w23, and 1bjo. Nonomitted versions of the molecular phylogeny are provided as Supplementary Figures 1­4. The ancestral sequence at each node of the molecular phylogenies was inferred by using the ASET application, which was improved to enable fully automated data processing from the previous work.27 ASET was designed to map the amino acid replacements of each molecular phyPROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

logeny branch onto protein 3D structures. ASET accepts multiple alignments of amino acid sequences in either the FASTA or ClustalW format and protein 3D data in the Protein Data Bank format (one of the sequences in the alignment must be that of the protein 3D). ASET prepared the input data (sequences and phylogeny) for the PAML application.28 PAML was called from ASET for maximum likelihood inference of ancestral sequences. The amino acid replacements on each branch of the molecular phylogeny were inferred by comparing the ancestral sequences on the both ends of the branch. The inferred replacements were then used to calculate the balance of amino acids on the branches. Balance of amino acid A was defined as (number of sites replaced by amino acid A on the corresponding branch) À (number of sites substituted from amino acid A on the same branch). The balances were calculated from nonalkaline to alkaline cluster's directions in Tables II and III. ASET output a New Hampshire/Newick formatted tree, in which the branch number and the bootstrap probability were assigned to each branch. ASET also generated a Rasmol script, in which the replacement position and the pattern at each branch in molecular phylogeny were mapped on the 3D structures. This script enabled a quick alloca-

tion of branch-specific replacements on the structures (Fig. 1). Comparison of Molecular Properties Between Alkaline and Nonalkaline Enzymes The molecular properties listed in Table IV were compared between the alkaline and nonalkaline enzymes. A nonpolar atomic contact was defined as the number of pairs of alkyl or ° aromatic carbon atoms existing within 3.5 A.12 An ion pair was defined as the number of residue pairs in which nega° tively and positively charged atoms existed within 4.0 A.12 The isoelectric points of the proteins (pIcalc) were evaluated with GENETYX ver.11.0 (Software Development). The accessible surface area was calculated with an inhouse program based on the Lee and Richards method.29 The molecular volume was determined as follows. Each molecular structure was first covered with a grid of points ° ° with 0.5 A intervals, and the points within 3.0 A from any of the protein atoms were judged to be inside the molecule. The molecular volume was defined as 0.53 3 (number of ° inside points) A3. Among the remaining grid points, those that were not connected to the points outside the molecules were judged to consist of cavities. Each of the molecular properties was compared within the four protein families, and put them together. The values were normalized using that of one nonalkaline enzyme as the standard, to allow comparisons between different protein families. The values of 1bli, 1mee, 1egz, and 1bjo were used as the standards for amylases, proteases, cellulases, and phosphoserine aminotransferases, respectively. If the

value of the standard protein was n and that of another cognate protein was m, then the normalized values of the standard and cognate proteins were 1 and m/n, respectively. The two-sample Student's t-value was then calculated for each molecular property. A negative sign was given to the t-values in Table IV, if the average was smaller for the alkaline enzymes. The P-values are two-side probabilities for all protein families in the same table.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Overall Structure of AmyK and Comparison With Close Relatives ° The crystal structure of AmyK was determined at 2.1 A resolution. AmyK adopts the canonical GH13 glycoside hydrolase fold. It consists of three domains, A, B, and C, comprising residues 5­106/210­398, 107­209, and 399­ 485, respectively (Fig. 2). AmyK was found to bind three calcium ions (Ca1-3 in Fig. 2) and one sodium ion (Na in Fig. 2) at the positions conserved in the related enzymes. The molecular phylogeny of the amylases that share more than 25% identity in amino acid sequence with AmyK is shown in Figure 3(a). The molecular phylogeny contains five enzymes with known 3D structures. Among the more than forty 3D structures of GH13 family amylases in the Protein Data Bank, those closest to AmyK were BHA from the alkaliphilic Bacillus halmapalus (PDB code 1w9x)30 and the amylase from the alkaliphilic Bacillus sp.707 (PDB codes 1wpc and 1wp6).31 The two enzymes shared 86% identity with AmyK in the amino

acid sequences, and their structures superposed on the ° ° AmyK structure with 0.52 A and 0.46 A rmsds, respectively, using 480 Ca atoms. AmyK38 from the alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. KSM-K38 (PDB code 1ud3)32 is also similar to AmyK. AmyK38 lacks the three calcium-binding sites that are known to be important for the structural integrity and are therefore conserved in GH13 family, including AmyK. AmyK and AmyK38 shared 67% sequence identity and were super° posed with a 0.91 A rmsd, using 477 Ca atoms. The alkaline amylases form a cluster on the phylogenetic tree, which suggests a single origin of the alkaliphilic nature of the enzymes [Fig. 3(a)]. According to the
PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

molecular phylogeny, the alkaliphilic nature of the enzymes was obtained on branch b1 in Figure 3(a). Then, AmyK38 first branched out from the others [branch b100 in Fig. 3(a)]. The loss of the calcium binding sites in AmyK38 occurred on branch b100 . The amino acid replacements that specifically took place on the branches in the molecular phylogeny were inferred. Figure 3(b) shows the positions of the residues that were replaced on the branches b1 (alkaline cluster root), b10 (from alkaline cluster root to AmyK relatives), and b100 (from alkaline cluster root to AmyK38) in the amylase phylogeny.

Comparison of AmyK and the Most Distantly Related Alkaline Amylase AmyK38 AmyK38 is the most distantly related alkaliphilic homologue of AmyK. The amino acid replacement sites in AmyK38 evolution (branch b1@) occurred throughout the molecule, including the B domain with the two calcium-

binding sites, while the replacements in branches b1 and b10 were mainly located in the A and C domains [Fig. 3(b)]. Accordingly, many of the Asp residues, which were used for calcium binding in AmyK and other alkaline amylases, were mainly replaced by Asn in AmyK38 [Fig. 4(a)]. Although the Asp residues were substituted at the calciumbinding sites, the total number of Asp residues increased

on the b1@ branch (Table II). The extensive modification of the B domain in AmyK38 suggests that the enzyme and other alkaline amylases adopted differently after the establishment of the alkaline cluster, as follows. The two residues, Arg181 and Gly182, of AmyK in the loop proximal to the calcium-binding sites were deleted in AmyK38 [Fig. 4(a)]. A deletion mutant of the two residues in AmyK resulted in thermostabilization and higher resistance to a chelating reagent.33 This suggests that AmyK38 is a natural chelator resistant strain, as a consequence of the removal of the calcium-binding sites and the residues Arg181-Gly182. The active site of AmyK consists of three acidic residues, Asp236, Glu266, and Asp333.6 These residues are conserved between AmyK and AmyK38 [Fig. 4(b)]. Met202 of AmyK exists in the proximity of the active site. The mutant AmyKMet202Leu demonstrated increased resistance of the enzymatic activity against oxidative reagents.34,35 The improvement in oxidative stability by replacements of the homologous site of AmyK-Met202 with nonoxdizable amino acids, such as Leu, Ala, Val, or Phe, was also reported for the B. licheniformis amylase.36 The Sg atom of Met202 is highly accessible to the solvent in the AmyK structure, which explains why the oxidation of this site has an inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity. Met residue and its conformation are conserved at this site. The atoms of the active ° sites and the Met residues were superposed with 0.53­1.28 A rmsd among the amylase structures used in this study. Only exception was AmyK38, in which the site has been modified from Met to Leu [Fig. 4(b)], suggesting that AmyK38 is also the natural resistant enzyme against oxidative stress. Searching for the Origin of the Alkaliphilic Nature of the Enzymes by ASET The evolutionary events responsible for the establishment of the alkaline enzymes were investigated. Previous
PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

studies of the alkaline protease and cellulase revealed that the acquisition of the alkaliphilic nature was concurrent with the loss of Lys­Asp ion pairs and the gain of those with Arg residues.12,13 However, the previous studies were done on a relatively small number of sequences and 3D structures, which were available at that time and were manageable for the primitive applications. The available information has increased since then, and so the analyses of the proteases, cellulases, and phosphoserine aminotransferases were repeated in the present study, along with those of the amylases, by using the current highly automated ASET application. From 3­10 times more sequences were used in the present study than those used before. Figures 3(a) and 5 show the molecular phylogenies of 59 amylases, 66 proteases, 53 cellulases, and 89 phosphoserine aminotransferases. The amylases and proteases each had one cluster of alkaline enzymes. The clusters were separated by branches b1 [Fig. 3(a)] and b2 [Fig. 5(a)] from the nonalkaline homologues, respectively. The cellulases and phosphoserine aminotransferases each had two clusters, which were defined by branches b3 and b4 [Fig. 5(b)], and branches b5 and b6 [Fig. 5(c)], respectively. These molecular phylogenies were used for the analysis of the alkaline adaptation evolutionary process. This analysis was based on a simple assumption: the evolutionary events that were responsible for the cluster founding should have occurred on the cluster root branches. The evolutionary events would be highlighted if the sequences before and after the branches were directly compared.27 Table III summarizes the amino acid balances on the alkaline adaptation branches. In Table III, the amino acids are sorted by the total balance on the branches. Because of the relatively low bootstrap probabilities for branches b1 (67%), b2 (44%), and b5 (48%), the replacements were evaluated for the b1 þ b10 , b2 þ b20 , and b5 þ b50 branches, respectively [Figs. 3(a) and 5].

ture comparison of the phosphoserine aminotransferases.15 It would be very interesting to define the differences in the molecular structure and the intramolecular interactions before and after alkaline adaptation. The proteins used for this study included 6 (4) amylases, 11 (4) proteases, 5 (3) cellulases, and 3 (2) phosphoserine aminotransferases for which the 3D structures have been determined (the numbers of alkaline enzymes are in parentheses) [Figs. 3(a) and 5]. These structures were extensively compared in terms of their amino acid contents, intramolecular interactions, and other molecular properties, such as molecular weight, volume, accessible surface area (ASA), and cavity volume (the examined properties are listed in Table IV). Hydrophobic Interactions Table IV summarizes the results of the comparisons. The differences between the alkaline and nonalkaline enzymes were assessed with the Student's t-value (a negative sign was added to the value if the average is smaller for the alkaline enzymes). The most significant difference between the two groups was the increase in Leu content (amino acid contents-L in Table IV, P ¼ 0.009). Reductions in Phe and Ile contents were also observed as significant events (amino acid contents-F and I in Table IV, P ¼ 0.037 and 0.039, respectively). These results imply that hydrophobic interactions were modified during the alkaline adaptation process, as proposed for phosphoserine aminotransferases.15 However, the Leu acquisition is contrary to the replacement pattern observed for the adaptation branches (Leu tends to decrease, and Phe and Ile did not show any strong tendency in Table III). In addition, the number of nonpolar contacts in the molecules was not significantly different before and after adaptation (No. nonpolar contacts in Table IV, P ¼ 0.550). Since the known structures of the alkaline and nonalkaline enzymes were separated by several branches, and most of these branches were not involved in the alkaline adaptation process [Figs. 3(a) and 5], the consistency between the ASET and structure comparison results should be concerned with detecting the most relevant features. When two different groups of molecules are compared, they usually differ in several features that are not necessarily responsible for functional variation. ASET was used in this study to eliminate the nonrelevant differences by assessing the events within a particular evolutionary process. Therefore, the importance of the hydrophobic interaction in alkaline adaptation is not conclusive at this point. Ion Pairs The second most discriminating feature was the lysine content (amino acid contents-K in Table IV, P ¼ 0.026), which tends to decrease in alkaline enzymes. The number of Lys­Asp/Glu ion pairs (K­D/E in Table IV, P ¼ 0.032) decreased in alkaline enzymes, and that of Arg­Glu ion pairs increased (R­E in Table IV, P ¼ 0.030). The loss of

The observed balance is basically consistent with the previous conclusion: Lys and Asp tend to decrease, and Arg and His tend to increase in the alkaline adaptation process.12,13 In this study, another charged amino acid, Glu, was found among those acquired in the adaptation process. Some hydrophobic amino acids also showed tendencies in alkaline adaptation. Leu was lost, and relatively smaller hydrophobic residues, Ala and Val, were acquired. Therefore, changes in hydrophobic interactions might be involved in the alkaline adaptation. 3D Structure Comparisons Between the Alkaline and Nonalkaline Enzymes The previous studies revealed that the Lys/Asp loss and Arg acquisition in the alkaline adaptation process resulted in the loss of Lys­Asp/Glu ion pairs, which was partly compensated by the acquisition of Arg­Asp/Glu ion pairs. On the other hand, changes in the number of H-bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and molecular surface area were important features determined from the struc-

The branches b10 and b1@ were not used for this analysis. Ion pair remodeling that is different from the consensus, Lys­Asp/Glu loss and Arg­Asp/Glu gain.

Lys residues and Lys­Asp/Glu ion pairs, and the acquisition of Arg­Glu ion pairs showed the same tendency for all four protein families, except for the amylases in which the number of Arg­Glu pairs slightly decreased. The acquisition of Arg­Glu/Asp pairs and the loss of Lys­Asp ion pairs (R­D/E and K­D for Cel in Table IV, P ¼ 0.012 and 0.028, respectively) were most remarkable for the cellulase family. These features are consistent with those derived from the ASET analysis, and also agree with the previous conclusion on proteases and cellulases. Therefore, the ion pair remodeling disfavoring Lys is thought to be the consensus and relevant phenomenon in the alkaline adaptation of proteins. The fractions of positively charged (K þ R in Table IV, P ¼ 0.114) and negatively charged (D þ E in Table IV, P ¼ 0.547) amino acids did not show significant differences, as reflected in the total charge balance of the molecules. The estimated isoelectric point only slightly shifted toward an alkaline pH in the adaptation process (pIcalc in Table IV, P ¼ 0.181). The modification of the charged amino acids appeared to be moderate.

and cavity number and volume did not show significant and consensus differences between the alkaline and nonalkaline enzymes (Table IV). Therefore, a drastic change in molecular properties is not generally required for alkaline adaptation. Although they were not found to be a consensus, several features showed significant differences for particular protein families. For example, a significant reduction in the ASA (ASA for Pro in Table IV, P ¼ 0.003) was observed for amylases and proteases. The reduction in molecular weight and molecular volume (MW and volume for Pro in Table IV, P ¼ 0.004 and 0.007, respectively) of the proteases should be the relevant events in the ASA reduction. The ASA reduction was also proposed for the alkaline phosphoserine aminotransferases,15 although it was not significant in this study due to the small sample number.

Ion Pair Remodeling in Alkaline Adaptation Ion pair remodeling appeared to be the most relevant and general event in alkaline adaptation, based on the structure comparisons. The loss of Lys residues led to the loss of Lys­Asp/Glu ion pairs. Since the total number of ion pairs did not significantly change (No. ion pairs for all in Table IV, P ¼ 0.596), the loss of Lys­Asp/Glu seemed to be compensated by the acquisition of Arg (mainly Arg­

Glu) ion pairs. Did these events actually take place on the alkaline adaptation branches? By mapping the ancestral sequences on the current 3D structures, the presence or absence of a particular interaction was anticipated. For example, if a site has been changed from Lys to another amino acid on a branch in the phylogeny, and if the side chain of any proximal Asp or Glu residue in contacts the side chain of the replaced Lys, then one Lys­Asp/Glu ion pair is considered to be lost on the branch. Note that this analysis is arbitrary to a certain extent, because the exact conformations of the ancestral proteins are not available. Table V shows the statistics of the ion pair changes caused by Lys/Asp loss or Arg/Glu acquisition on the alkaline adaptation branches. Lys residues tend to be replaced by Glu or Gln. When Lys was replaced by Glu (the top of Table V), Lys­Asp/Glu pairs were lost in five out of eight cases, and the five cases contained two cogenerations of Arg­Glu ion pairs. At the same time, however, the acquired Glu residues formed two new Lys­Glu ion pairs with neighboring Lys residues, which were contrary to the consensus direction of ion pair remodeling. In total, the loss of a Lys residue abolished 15 ion pairs out of 24 cases (15/24 ¼ 63%). When Arg residues were acquired, all of the cases resulted in the formation of Arg­ Asp/Glu ion pairs (6/6 ¼ 100%). In the structures used in this study, 42% of Lys and 54% of Arg residues on average are used for ion pairs. Since the rates of ion pair remodeling, 63% for Lys and 100% for Arg, are higher than the averages, the replacements of the positively charged residues appear to be oriented toward the ion pair remodeling.

On the other hand, Lys­Asp ion pairs were abolished in only 2 out of 13 cases (2/13 ¼ 15%) when Asp residues were lost. These processes also involved the loss of one Arg­Asp ion pair, which was contrary to the consensus direction of remodeling. Five Arg­Glu ion pairs were acquired by a total of 18 acquisitions of Glu residues (5/18 ¼ 28%), and four Lys­Glu ion pairs were formed concomitantly. Since an average of 34% of Asp and 42% of Glu residues are involved in ion pairs in the current proteins, the replacements of the negatively charged amino acids did not contribute to the remodeling of ion pairs very much. Distribution of Replaced Charged Residues and Remodeled Ion Pairs on the Amylase Structure It was suggested that not all of the replacements of charged amino acids were used for ion pair remodeling. For example, among the replacements in the alkaline adaptation of amylases, Gln86(Lys) and Gln394(Lys), and Gly460(Asp) were not involved in ion pairs (the amino acid before adaptation is in parentheses). On the branches b1, b10 and b200 [Fig. 3(a)], 3, 3, and 27 sites seem to have changed from Lys/Asp, or changed into Arg/Glu, respectively [Fig. 6(a)]. Among these sites, 0, 2, and 18 might have resulted in Lys­Asp/Glu loss or Arg­ Asp/Glu acquisition, respectively [Fig. 6(b)]. These sites are distributed throughout the molecule, except for the proximity of the active site. No preference in the location of the ion pair remodeling on the molecule was observed. Many of the remodeled ion pairs in the branch b100 (AmyK38 branch) were found on B domain, because the

Asp residues in the calcium-binding sites were replaced by Asn on the branch [Table II and Fig. 4(a)]. The replacements caused the removal of Lys­Asp ion pairs as well as the Asp­Ca2þ interaction. This suggests that the abolishment of the calcium-binding sites was a part of the alkaline adaptation process that occurred after the establishment of the alkaline amylase cluster. CONCLUSIONS The structure of the alkaline amylase AmyK was used for the analysis of its alkaline adaptation, along with the previously analyzed proteases, cellulases, and phosphoserine aminotransferases. The analyses in this study involved more sequence and structure data than before, and are also based on four different protein families, and thus provide a more reliable conclusion for the alkaline adaptation process. The results revealed that the consensus event of alkaline adaptation was the loss of Lys residues. The loss of Lys appeared to result in the loss of Lys­Asp/Glu ion pairs, which was partly compensated by the acquisition of Arg­ Asp/Glu ion pairs. It was also observed that the replacements of positively charged residues were preferentially, but not always, aimed at ion pair remodeling. However, this was not the case for the negatively charged amino acids. REFERENCES
