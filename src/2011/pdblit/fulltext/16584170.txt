ABSTRACT: The structures of class carbonic anhydrases ( -CAs) determined so far fall into two distinct subclasses based on the observed coordination of the catalytic zinc (Zn2+) ion. The subclass of -CAs that coordinate Zn2+ tetrahedrally with four protein-derived ligands is represented by the structures of orthologues from Porphyridium purpureum, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here we present the structure of an additional member of that subclass, that from Haemophilus influenzae, as well as detailed kinetic analysis, revealing the correspondence between structural classification and kinetic profile for this subclass. In addition, we identify a unique, noncatalytic binding mode for the substrate bicarbonate that occurs in both the H. influenzae and E. coli enzymes. The kinetic and structural analysis indicates that binding of bicarbonate in this site of the enzyme may modulate its activity by influencing a pH-dependent, cooperative transition between active and inactive forms. We hypothesize that the two structural subclasses of -CAs may provide models for the proposed active and inactive forms of the H. influenzae and E. coli enzymes.

Carbonic anhydrase (carbonate hydrolyase, EC 4.2.1.1) is a zinc metalloenzyme that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of CO2 and bicarbonate:

CO2 + H2O / HCO3- + H+

(1)

Six classes of convergently evolved forms of CA1 have been described to date. The R-form is found in animals and some eubacteria (1); a -form is represented in an archaebacterium (2); there are two diatom forms,  (3) and (4), the latter of which is apparently a cadmium metalloenzyme; and finally a carboxysome form ( ) has been reported (5). The remaining form of CA ( ) is widely distributed in plants and eubacteria

(6). The X-ray crystallographic structures determined for -CAs reveal two distinct zinc coordination spheres. In the enzymes from Pisum satiVum (7), Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (8), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1284 (9), the active site zinc ion is coordinated by one histidine and two cysteine residues, with a fourth coordination site occupied by water or a substrate analogue. In contrast, in the enzymes from Porphyridium purpureum (10), Escherichia coli (11), and M. tuberculosis Rv3588c (9) the active site water molecule has been replaced by an aspartate side chain, forming a noncanonical CA active site. The latter group of CAs is characterized by little or no CO2 hydration activity at pH values less than 7.0, compared to the former group. The nature of the relationship between these two subclasses of -CA poses an interesting problem. Do the different coordination spheres in these -CA subclasses imply that each has a fundamentally different catalytic mechanism? Or do these two structural variants of -CA represent alternate conformations of the protein that are the hallmarks of a regulatory process? Direct evidence to support either of these alternatives has thus far been lacking. For example, all carbonic anhydrases kinetically characterized to date indicate noncooperative, Michaelis-Menten behavior despite the fact that, among the various CA classes, a wide variety of homooligomeric forms are observed. However, no members of the P. purpureum-like -CAs have been rigorously kinetically characterized. To help to address these issues, and to further define the kinetic profile of this structural subclass, we report here the crystallographic structure determination and kinetic charac-

We also report structural evidence for a noncatalytic bicarbonate binding site in the E. coli (ECCA) and H. influenzae enzymes. For bicarbonate dehydration at chemical equilibrium, HICA exhibits substrate inhibition. In addition, this enzyme exhibits highly cooperative pH-rate profiles both at steady-state and at chemical equilibrium. These data suggest that bicarbonate has a role in the allosteric regulation of activity of both ECCA and HICA, and potentially other members of the -CA class. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Expression and Purification of Recombinant Enzymes. Recombinant ECCA was prepared as described previously (12). The entire gene encoding for HICA was PCR-amplified from plasmid obtained from clone HI1301 (American Type Culture Collection) using the oligonucleotide primers pHI1X (5-TGCCCATGGATAAAATTAAACTCTTT-3) and pHI2X (5-TGCCTGCAGTTATTATGTATTTTCAAGATG-3) which contain NcoI and PstI restriction sites, respectively (underlined). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the NcoI and PstI sites of pTrc99a, yielding the expression vector pHICA. The HICA coding sequence was verified by DNA sequencing (BigDye 2.0, PE Biosystems) using an ABI310 capillary electrophoresis sequencer (PE Biosystems). The HICA coding sequence of pHICA conforms to the expected coding sequence of HICA (GenBank NC·007146). HICA was overexpressed by inoculating 1 L of TB medium supplemented with 1 mM ZnSO4 and 100 µg/mL ampicillin with an overnight culture of E. coli (JM109) harboring pHICA. After growth at 37 °C with shaking to an OD600 of 0.6-1.0 (about 31/2 h), the culture was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG and shaken overnight at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000g for 10 min, resuspended in 40 mL of buffer A3 (20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 µM EDTA, pH 8.00), and subjected to lysis in a BeadBeater (Biospec). The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 48000g for 45 min, loaded onto a 26 × 100 mm Q-Sepharose fast-flow column (Amersham) at 4 mL/min, washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A3 containing 150 mM NaCl, and eluted with 3 column volumes of buffer A3 containing 300 mM NaCl. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the pooled eluate to bring it to 1.0 M, and this solution was loaded onto a 16 × 100 mm butyl-Sepharose fast-flow column (Amersham) at 4 mL/min, washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A3 containing 900 mM (NH4)2SO4, and eluted with 2 column volumes of buffer A3 containing 525 mM (NH4)2SO4. Pooled eluate was concentrated to 2 mL using centrifugal ultrafiltration (MacroSep, 30K MWCO; Filtron) and applied to a 16 × 600 mm Superdex 200 column (Amersham) equilibrated with buffer A3 containing 100 mM NaCl. This column was eluted at 1 mL/min with the same buffer, and the major protein peak fractions were pooled. Purified protein was concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration to 500 µL and stored at 4 °C. Active enzyme concentrations for both ECCA and HICA were determined by ICP-OES for Zn at 213.856 nm using a Perkin-Elmer Optima SC 3000. Steady-State Kinetics Methods. Saturated solutions of CO2 were prepared by bubbling CO2 gas into water in a vessel maintained at 25 ( 0.1 °C, and dilutions were prepared in

Cronk et al. the absence of air by coupling two gastight syringes as described by Khalifah (13). CO2 concentrations were calculated on the basis of a 33.8 mM saturated solution at 25 °C (14). All steady-state kinetic measurements were made at 25 °C using a Hi-Tech SF-61DX2 stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Initial rates of CO2 hydration were measured using the changing pH-indicator method described previously (13, 15, 16). All stopped-flow kinetic studies were carried out in the presence of 250 mM Na2SO4, which was required for maximum enzyme stability and activity in dilute solution. Values of kcat and Km were determined by nonlinear leastsquares fits to V/[E] vs [CO2] data using Origin 6.0 (Microcal). The kinetic constants kcat and kcat/Km are reported here on a per subunit basis. Oxygen-18 Exchange Kinetics Methods. The rate of exchange of 18O between species of CO2 and water (eqs 2 and 3) is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase (17):

HCOO18O- + EZnH2O / EZnHCOO18O- + H2O / CO2 + EZn18OH- + H2O (2) EZn18OH- + BH+ / H+ EZn18OH- + B / EZn18OH2 (+H2O) / EZnOH2 + H218O (3)
Using an Extrel EXM-200 mass spectrometer with a membrane permeable to gases, we measured the isotopic exchange of 18O shown in eqs 2 and 3 at chemical equilibrium and 25 °C (17). Solutions contained 250 mM Na2SO4 for maximum enzyme stability and activity. No added buffer species were present. This method determines two rates in the catalytic pathway (17). The first, defined as R1, is the rate of interconversion of CO2 and HCO3- at chemical equilibrium. The pH dependence of R1 is typically described by the equation (18):

R1 [E]

)

Rmax 1 (1 + KZn/[H+])(1 + [H+]/KCO2)

(4)

where Rmax is the maximal value of R1, KZn is the apparent 1 acid dissociation constant of enzyme-bound Zn-OH2, and KCO2 is the apparent acid dissociation constant of CO2. This method also determines a second rate, RH2O, which is the rate of release from the enzyme of water labeled with 18 O. A proton from a donor group (BH+ in eq 3) converts zinc-bound 18O-labeled hydroxide to zinc-bound 18O-labeled water, which readily exchanges with and is irreversibly diluted by unlabeled solvent H216O. The magnitude of RH2O can be interpreted in terms of the rate constant of proton transfer from a donor group to the zinc-bound hydroxide according to the equation:

RH2O [E]

)

kB (1 + KD/[H ])(1 + [H+]/KA)
+

(5)

where kB is the maximal rate of proton transfer, KD is the apparent acid dissociation constant for the donor group, and KA is the apparent acid dissociation constant for the acceptor group (19). Experimental data for R1 and RH2O were fit to modified versions of eqs 4 and 5 (see Results and Discussion

sections) using nonlinear least squares in Origin 6.0 (Microcal). Values of R1/[E] and RH2O/[E] are reported here on a per subunit basis. Crystallographic Methods. Rosettes of crystalline HICA were obtained in 48 h by the hanging drop method using 1.7 M (NH4)2SO4, 4% (v/v) PEG-400, 0.10 M HEPES, pH 7.50, and 8-12 mg/mL protein at 4 °C. Individual crystals were separated using a probe and transferred to artificial mother liquor supplemented with 25% glycerol for 30 s, followed by flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. To prepare HICA complexed with bicarbonate ion, individual crystals were soaked for 15 min in artificial mother liquor containing 25% glycerol and 100 mM NaHCO3. Data collection was performed with a rotating copper anode source (Rigaku RU200) and an R-Axis IV image plate detector using 0.5° oscillations at a temperature of 95 K. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (20) (HKL Research). An initial molecular replacement solution was obtained by using a modified ECCA (PDB entry 1I6P) search model using EPMR (21). This initial solution was subjected to rigid-body refinement, simulated annealing, and multiple rounds of refinement using CNS 1.1 (22) and model building in the program O (23). Crystals of ECCA in space group P4322 were grown as described previously (12) and transferred to 40% PEG-400 containing 250 mM NaHCO3 and 100 mM MES at pH 7.0. After being soaked for 20 min, the crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and diffraction data collected at 115 K using beamline 5.0.1 of the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories. The data, collected to 2.25 Å resolution, were indexed, reduced, and scaled using MOSFLM (24) and CCP4 (25). The previously determined structure for ECCA (PDB entry 1I6O), with all water molecules omitted, was used as a model. In this case, a

molecular replacement search was unnecessary. An initial rigid-body refinement, using CNS 1.1 (22), reduced the R factor from 0.382 to 0.294 (Rfree from 0.392 to 0.298). Phases calculated from the model were used in combination with experimental structure factor amplitudes to calculate electron density maps. The initial model was adjusted manually using the program O (23) to conform to 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc difference Fourier maps. Simulated annealing omit maps were used in verifying the correctness of the model, and positional and B-factor refinement was performed prior to addition of bicarbonate and solvent molecules to the model. The final model was arrived at following multiple rounds of individual torsional and B-factor refinement using CNS (22) and addition of solvent molecules, combined with inspection and manual adjustment. Data collection and refinement statistics for all three models are reported in Table 1. RESULTS OVerexpression and Purification of HICA. HICA was expressed in E. coli at levels of up to 40% of total protein, according to scanning densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. One liter of overnight bacterial culture (25 g wet cell paste) typically yielded 10-20 mg of homogeneous enzyme. The molecular mass of purified HICA, determined from its elution volume during the last purification step on a calibrated size exclusion column (Superdex 200, Pharmacia), was 99 ( 14 kDa. This value is consistent with a molecular mass of 105.26 kDa calculated for a tetramer of HICA, including the zinc cofactor. OVerall Structure of HICA. The structure of HICA (PDB entry 2A8C) was determined by molecular replacement from data collected from a single crystal in the C2 space group. Summary statistics are shown in Table 1. HICA has an overall fold and zinc coordination geometry that is essentially

identical to that of the ECCA structure determined previously (11). The CR RMSD between ECCA and HICA for residues 35-200 is 0.804 Å. Each subunit adopts an R/ fold, with a central -sheet composed mainly of four parallel strands (Figure 1). The zinc ion of each active site, located at the C-terminal edge of this sheet, is coordinated to four residues within the same monomer, Cys42, His98, Cys101, and Asp44, in an approximately tetrahedral geometry. The entire crystal structure shows that the native, biologically relevant tetramer is most likely a dimer of dimers.2 Subunits related by a 2-fold symmetry axis (which lies along the central horizontal in the projection shown in Figure 1) constitute the fundamental dimer. This dimerization interface between subunits extends the -sheet core and completes the formation of an active site pocket associated with the zinc ion bound by the opposing monomer. A second 2-fold axis (vertical in Figure 1) relates the two dimers of the native tetramer. The region between dimers, defined here as the tetramerization interface, contains four additional, strong electron density peaks >5.0, approximately spherical in shape. These symmetry-related regions of nonprotein density are surrounded by several basic residues: Arg160, Lys165, and Arg198 from one subunit, plus Arg124 from the neighboring subunit. This electron density has been interpreted as sulfate, which is present at high concentration in the crystallization conditions. The location of the sulfate binding sites in the biologically relevant unit is shown in Figure 1. Noncatalytic Bicarbonate Binding Sites. Strong electron density in Fo - Fc maps (>3) not explainable by protein or solvent is observed in ECCA and HICA crystals soaked in HCO3-. (PDB entries for these structures are 2ESF and 2A8D, respectively, with refinement statistics given in
2 The asymmetric unit of the crystal, contained in PDB entry 2A8C, is comprised of six subunits, designated A-F. Of the three dimers per asymmetric unit, two dimers (chains C and E and chains D and F) constitute a biologically relevant unit, the native tetramer. A second tetramer straddles the C2 axis in the unit cell and can be formed by applying crystallographic symmetry operators to chains A and B.

FIGURE 2: Noncatalytic bicarbonate binding sites in HICA (A) and ECCA (B). Fourier difference maps, shown in cyan at a contour of 3.5, were calculated as described in Experimental Procedures. In both cases, the final model in this vicinity is also shown, with some groups omitted for clarity. Key residues in the noncatalytic binding site are shown as ball-and-stick models. Thin lines denote the loop formed by residues 43-46. These figures were prepared using the program O (23) from PDB entries 2A8C and 2ESF, respectively.

Table 1.) We have interpreted this electron density, triangular and planar in shape, as bicarbonate (Figure 2). The plane of the bicarbonate ion, located approximately 8 Å from the zinc ion, is roughly perpendicular to the local plane of the central -sheet, nearest strand S1 (residues 37-43; see Figure 3). Two of the four zinc ligands, Cys42 and Asp44, are located near the C-terminal end of this strand, which is situated between strands S2 (residues 59-65) and S3 (residues 9199). Strand S2 lies along the dimerization interface, and the two other zinc ligands, His98 and Cys101, occur at or just after the C-terminus of S3. The bicarbonate site is thus in the vicinity of both the active site and the dimerization interface and, relative to the zinc ion, is on the opposite side of the Asp44 ligand, the proposed site for the catalytic activation of substrate (10, 26). The bicarbonate ion is surrounded by the side chains of Trp39, Arg64, and Tyr181. Each of these residues is in position to donate one or more hydrogen bonds to the bicarbonate ion. Main-chain groups do not play a significant role in direct interactions with bicarbonate, with the notable exception of the carbonyl oxygen of Val47, which is poised to act as a hydrogen bond acceptor. In addition to bicarbonate, this pocket contains two well-defined spherical peaks of electron density that we have

interpreted as water molecules. These waters are in position to form multiple hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms of the bicarbonate ion and protein functional groups. One of the water molecules is hydrogen-bonded to bicarbonate, the carbonyl oxygen of Cys96, and the main-chain amide of Cys42. This water, denoted henceforth as the common water, occurs in roughly the same location in most -CA structures determined to date, including those from P. satiVum (7) and P. purpureum (10). The second water molecule, the unique water, is also in a hydrogen bond with bicarbonate and is bound to the protein by the main-chain amides of Ser45 and Arg46, as well as the -cloud of the imidazole ring of His98. Finally, a hydrogen bond between the main-chain amide of Val47 and the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr181 further stabilizes the conformation of residues forming this pocket. The hydrogen-bonding network in the bicarbonate binding site is represented schematically in Figure 4. Steady-State Kinetics. The pH profiles of kcat and kcat/Km for the CO2 hydration reaction at steady state for HICA (Figure 5) exhibit strong pH dependence, consistent with a requirement for the loss of multiple protons in order to generate the active, basic form of the enzyme. The pH dependence of kcat (Figure 5A) can be adequately fit to a model, described by eq 6 , that requires the sequential loss

of two protons from two groups whose pKa values are in this case not significantly different and near 8.3 in order to generate active enzyme. In eq 6, kobs is the observed value of kcat at any pH, kmax is the maximal value of kcat at high pH, and Ka1 and Ka2 are acid dissociation constants corresponding to the stepwise ionization of the enzyme, EH2 / EH- + H+ / E2- + 2 H+, where the doubly deprotonated form is the active species. Values for these parameters are given in Figure 5. The kcat/Km data are consistent with a model, described by eq 7 (Figure 5B), that requires the

Reaction conditions were 25 °C, 40 mM buffer (1-methylimidazole, pH 7.00-8.25; 1,2dimethylimidazole, pH 8.25-9.25), 30-80 µM indicator dye (pnitrophenol with 1-methylimidazole; m-cresol purple with 1,2dimethylimidazole), 10 µM EDTA, 250 mM Na2SO4, and 0.4-15 µM enzyme.

Values for these parameters are given in the legend of Figure 5. Oxygen-18 Exchange Kinetics. The pH profiles of R1, RH2O, and kcat/Km (derived from 18O exchange data) also show highly cooperative pH-rate profiles not consistent with simple one-proton ionizations. The pH dependence of R1 can be fit to the equation:

which shows a four-proton dependence at low pH and a twoproton dependence at high pH (Figure 6A). In eq 8, R1/[E] is the observed value of this rate constant at any pH, kmax is the maximal, intrinsic value of R1/[E], KZn is the acid dissociation constant of the zinc-water complex, and Ka is the acid dissociation constant of four groups that must be deprotonated, EH4 / E4- + 4H+, to form the active species of the enzyme. Values for all parameters are given in Figure 6. Equation 8 is similar to eq 7, except for the expected additional pH dependence on the ionization state of the active site zinc-bound water as required by eq 4 (27). The denominator term for the ionization of substrate CO2/HCO3in eq 4 is neither necessary nor observable for the pH range of data reported here, since pKCO2 is approximately 6.3, and the data of Figure 6 is for pH values >7.5. For maximal R1/[E], eq 8 suggests that the active form of the enzyme has lost four protons cooperatively from a group or groups with a pKa of 8.2, and two groups of pKa 8.6, presumably ZnOH2, are protonated (Figure 6A). The pH dependence of RH2O is very similar in shape to that of R1 (Figure 6B), again with a four-proton dependence at low pH and a two-proton dependence at high pH, suggesting that the most active form of the enzyme must cooperatively lose four protons for maximal activity. Equation 9 describes how these data might be best interpreted, with the high pH limb of the data originating from two donor groups that are capable of protonating the active site zinc hydroxide (19) as described in eq 5. Here kmax represents the maximal, intrinsic value of RH2O/[E], and KD represents the acid dissociation constant of groups that donate protons to Zn-OH2 to enable loss of 18 O label to water (27). Ka has the same meaning as in eq 8. Values for all parameters in eq 9 are given in Figure 6. The

value of kcat/Km for the hydration reaction, calculated from 18 O exchange data (27), also fits well to a model described by eq 7 which requires the cooperative loss of four protons from groups with a pKa of 8.3 to generate the active enzyme (Figure 6C). HICA-catalyzed 18O exchange appears to be strongly inhibited by HCO3-. Indeed, at pH values below 8.0, it is difficult to observe R1 or RH2O at CO2 + HCO3- concentrations higher than 2 mM. At pH 8.75, where it is possible to accurately measure 18O exchange kinetics over a range of

CO2 + HCO3- concentrations, the substrate dependence of both R1 and RH2O is clearly biphasic. At low concentrations of CO2 + HCO3- these rates increase in a hyperbolic (Michaelis-Menten) fashion but at higher concentrations decrease in a cooperative fashion (Figure 7). These data can be adequately fit to a substrate inhibition model (see Discussion) in which HCO3- acts as both a substrate and an inhibitor:

Noncatalytic Bicarbonate Binding Site in -CA

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 14, 2006 4357 -CAs, bicarbonate acts as a regulator as well as a substrate. While bicarbonate is of course a ubiquitous metabolite and physiological buffer, catalytic and regulatory roles for it have been characterized. Bicarbonate stimulates the activity of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), an evolutionarily conserved class of adenylyl cyclases that act at an upstream position in various intracellular signaling pathways (28). Bicarbonate has also been shown to act catalytically as a general base in dizinc leucine aminopeptidase (29). The noncatalytic bicarbonate binding site in HICA and ECCA seems to be exquisitely designed for recognition of this ion. The side chains of Trp39, Arg64, and Tyr181, as well as two water molecules, donate no less than six hydrogen bonds to the negatively charged bicarbonate ion, and a lone, critical hydrogen bond acceptor interaction with the carbonyl of Val47 assists in discrimination between HCO3- and other competing anions that cannot act as a hydrogen bond donor. By virtue of the second hydrogen bond contributed by its main-chain amide, to Tyr181 OH, Val47 also participates in the formation of the bicarbonate binding pocket by pinning down the critical 44-47 loop. Two questions arise in light of these observations: How do other examples of bicarbonate reported in protein structures compare with the noncatalytic binding site in HICA and ECCA, and what role, if any, does the ligand play in the function of proteins in which it has been observed? A survey of protein structures containing bicarbonate reveals that, in general, proximity to an arginine side chain and ligation to metal ions are the most common structural features. Of the cases examined, the one that most resembles the present case is found in the structure of cystathionine -lyase from E. coli, where bicarbonate is bound tightly near the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor (30). The same side chains participate in HCO3- binding as in the -CA site, but the sites are stereochemically distinct and do not appear to be homologous. The conserved arginine acts as a carboxylate recognition motif for the enzyme's normal substrate, and bicarbonate apparently binds as a competitive inhibitor. In the case of sAC, where bicarbonate has been inferred to cause a presumably allosteric activation by promoting conformational changes at the active site and recruitment of a second catalytic metal ion, the location of its action has remained undefined (31). Thus, the noncatalytic binding site in HICA and ECCA appears to be novel. The biphasic, substrate inhibition kinetics of R1 and RH2O in HICA is not observed in other classes of CAs, nor in Arabidopsis thaliana -CA (18). In addition, the highly cooperative pH-rate profiles for kcat, kcat/Km, R1, and RH2O are not observed for other CAs. Indeed, to date no carbonic anhydrase has been observed to have cooperative kinetics, not the dimeric -CA from M. thermoautotrophicum (32), the trimeric -CA from Methanosarcina thermophila (33), nor the octameric plant -CAs from A. thaliana (18) and P. satiVum (34). It is perhaps significant that the plant -CAs, as well as the -CA from M. thermoautotrophicum, are missing key elements of the noncatalytic bicarbonate binding site described here for ECCA and HICA. In particular, in both P. satiVum and A. thaliana -CA, the equivalent of Trp39 in HICA is replaced by a valine residue. In the M. thermoautotrophicum enzyme, the equivalents of both Trp39 and Tyr181 in HICA are replaced by isoleucine, and the equivalent of Arg64 in HICA is replaced by lysine. Another

DISCUSSION The structure of uncomplexed HICA reported here is remarkably similar to that of uncomplexed ECCA and the other P. purpureum-like -CAs and represents the fourth structure of this class, with Asp44 in lieu of water as the fourth zinc ligand. The observation of this -CA structure for enzymes from four different organisms suggests that these structures are not crystallization artifacts or anomalous structures but are instead likely to be physiologically relevant. Likewise, the novel bicarbonate binding mode identified is common to both the HICA and ECCA structures and unlikely to be artifactual. The site of bicarbonate binding is quite distinct from the zinc coordination site at which the dehydration of bicarbonate as a substrate is expected to occur. This latter observation may be important in an explanation for the existence of two distinct coordination states in -CA structures. It has been previously suggested that the P. purpureum-like -CA structures represent inactive conformations of the enzyme (11) and that the equivalent of Asp44 in HICA might be a mobile, exchangeable zinc ligand (10). Building upon these suggestions, if bicarbonate binding were only compatible with an inactive conformation of the enzyme, it raises the possibility that a given type of -CA adopts either of these two distinct conformations depending on bicarbonate levels. In other words, with respect to certain

difference of note concerns the S1 residue immediately preceding the first zinc ligand, which is Gly41 in HICA and ECCA. The corresponding residue is also glycine in the P. pupureum and M. tuberculosis Rv3588c -CAs, while a nonglycine residue occupies this position in the plant, M. thermoautotrophicum, as well as the M. tuberculosis Rv1284 -CAs. The absence of a -carbon in this location creates space adjacent to the -sheet that may be a steric necessity for accommodation of bicarbonate. While the sampling of -CAs whose kinetics have been thoroughly investigated is admittedly small, nonetheless we note that -CAs that are missing the key features of the noncatalytic bicarbonate binding site observed in HICA and ECCA do not exhibit cooperative kinetics. Given the proximity of the noncatalytic bicarbonate binding site to the catalytically important zinc ion, it is reasonable to suspect that this site might in some way influence the catalytic activity of the enzyme. In a two-state model for cooperative kinetics (35), the class of -CA structures typified by the coordination of Asp44 as a fourth ligand to the catalytically important zinc ion provides an attractive model for an inactive conformation of -CA. The possibility that certain -CAs might adopt an alternative, inactive conformation in which Asp44 displaces the catalytically essential water molecule has been suggested previously (11), where the P. satiVum CA structure served as a model for the as yet unobserved active conformation of ECCA. A comparison of structures, discussed further below, in light of the noncatalytic bicarbonate binding site identified in HICA and ECCA, indicates that adoption of a P. satiVumlike structure by HICA or ECCA would disrupt the bicarbonate binding pocket. Strictly speaking, the inactive conformation could exist in the absence of allosteric bicarbonate binding. However, the existence of an active conformation with bicarbonate bound in this site appears to be highly unlikely due to structural constraints. For the purposes of this discussion, we will consider there to be two principally populated states, with the P. purpureum-like -CA structure observed in HICA/ECCA serving as a model for an inactive "T-state" that is stabilized by bicarbonate and the P. satiVum

CA structure (PDB entry 1EKJ) as providing the key elements of an "R-state" model. This scheme is illustrated in Figure 8. In P. satiVum CA, Asp44 is displaced by a water molecule, but remains as a hydrogen bond acceptor from the zinc-bound water, and is engaged in a salt bridge with Arg46.3 The conformation of the loop from residues 44-47, which includes important elements of the bicarbonate binding site, is radically different. The position of theVal47 side chain would overlap that of the unique water molecule (Figure 9). While the exact nature of the coupling between bicarbonate binding in the noncatalytic site and the equilibrium between the proposed active and inactive states is unknown, it is quite plausible that the binding of bicarbonate ion could exert and have influence on the coordination state of the zinc ion. We

Noncatalytic Bicarbonate Binding Site in -CA note that the bicarbonate ion and the water molecules that are directly associated with it interact with residues in or around the zinc-ligation sphere. For example, the water molecules bound to the bicarbonate interact with the zinc ligands His98 and Cys42 and also with the main chain of Arg46, which is predicted by the scheme represented in Figure 8 to interact with Asp44 in the active conformation. Bicarbonate ion and its ligand Tyr181 both interact with the main chain of Val47, which anchors the 44-47 loop over the bicarbonate binding site. The loss of bicarbonate from this site might lead to a reorganization of this loop that allows the carboxylate group of Asp44 to pair with Arg46 instead of ligating zinc. Additionally, in P. satiVum CA, the structural region corresponding to the noncatalytic bicarbonate binding pocket in HICA has collapsed to form a hydrophobic region surrounding the side chain of Val47, which occupies the approximate position of the bicarbonate ion in HICA. In P. satiVum CA the insertion of the Val47 side chain into the hydrophobic pocket comprised by Phe309, Ile218, and Ala159 significantly reorients the loop corresponding to residues 44-47 in HICA that contain the catalytically important Arg46 residue. Site-directed mutagenesis of the M. thermoautotrophicum enzyme suggests that the coordination of Arg36 (equivalent to Arg46 in HICA) is essential for orienting Asp44 to generate the active species of enzyme (8). Therefore, it seems likely that the side chain of Val47 could provide the mechanism to couple an inactive-active state conformational equilibrium to bicarbonate ion. That is, the binding of bicarbonate stabilizes the inactive state by preventing the rotation of the 44-47 loop required to insert the side chain of Val47 into the bicarbonate binding site which would thereupon allow the coordination of Asp44 and Arg46 to generate active enzyme with a zinc-bound water molecule. The bicarbonate-binding residue Arg64 has an apparently quite distinct role in the context of the P. satiVum CA structure. The Arg64 guanidinium group forms three different hydrogen bonds to the main-chain carbonyl oxygens of residues Cys42 and Asp44, providing structural stability to this particular local main-chain conformation (36), which here is characteristic of an active -CA. Loss of this stabilization would be concomitant with the redirection of the Arg64 guanidinium group to interaction with bicarbonate, as seen in HICA/ECCA, facilitating adoption of a main-chain conformation of residues 44-47 characteristic of an inactive -CA. The envisioned transition between states would be expected to occur in a concerted fashion, with changes involving Arg64 acting synergistically with the other changes discussed above. Furthermore, since both the active site zinc and the bicarbonate binding site lie at or near the dimerization interface, binding of bicarbonate ion in one subunit could also affect neighboring subunits. Indeed, the noncatalytic bicarbonate binding sites are only 15 Å apart in the principal HICA dimer (Figure 10). Arg64, located on -strand S2, is the bicarbonate-binding residue that lies closest to the neighboring subunit across the dimerization interface. In HICA, there are intersubunit hydrogen bonds between His63NH-Arg64O, Arg64O-Arg64NH, S43OH-Val62O, and Arg46NH-Asn33O. The corresponding residues in P. satiVum carbonic anhydrase are not involved in intersubunit contacts.

FIGURE 10: Cartoon diagram of a single dimer of HICA (PDB entry 2A8D). Individual monomer chains are colored blue and orange. Each monomer depicts the noncatalytic bicarbonate binding site, including bicarbonate ion (red and gray spheres), principal interacting side chains Trp39, Arg64, and Tyr181 (sticks), and the active site zinc ion (magenta spheres). A short helical segment (residues 48-54) has been rendered invisible for clarity. This figure was prepared using PyMOL (40).

While the structural data suggest that bicarbonate serves a likely regulatory role in HICA, the kinetics data additionally suggest that this role is allosteric in nature. The sharp pHdependent transition from inactive to active protein around pH 8 is seen in kinetics measurements of both CO2 hydration (Figures 5B and 6C) and HCO3- dehydration (Figure 6A,B). That all of these pH dependences have the same directionality for both the forward and reverse reactions, that is, the enzyme is most active at high pH for both hydration and dehydration reactions, indicates that the relevant proton ionizations are not integral to the catalytic mechanism, else the pH profiles for CO2 hydration and HCO3- dehydration would be inverse of each other. Rather, the steep pH dependence of kcat/Km, R1, or RH2O at lower pH values in Figures 5B and 6 must instead relate to processes which affect the fraction of active enzyme available, e.g., a pH-dependent equilibrium between active and inactive conformations. The simplest explanation for the pH-rate profiles of kcat/ Km, R1, and RH2O (Figures 5B and 6) at lower pH values is a cooperative transition of the biologically relevant tetramer between an inactive conformation at low pH to an active conformation at high pH, in which all four subunits act in a concerted fashion: (EH)4 / (E-)4 + 4H+. The most plausible ionization event that triggers this conformation change is that of the zinc-bound water molecule. At high pH, when the zinc-bound water has ionized to hydroxide, Asp44 is displaced from the active site and instead ion pairs with Arg46 in a manner similar to that seen in P. satiVum -CA; at low pH, protonation of the zinc-bound hydroxide to the more labile zinc-bound water allows its facile displacement by Asp44, leading to a catalytically impotent form of the enzyme. Furthermore, HCO3- additionally stabilizes the

4360 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 14, 2006 inactive state, with Asp44 ligated to the active site zinc, by binding to its noncatalytic pocket. This hypothesis is consistent with the profound bicarbonate inhibition of R1 and RH2O at chemical equilibrium, especially at low pH. An alternative explanation of the low-pH limb of the data of Figures 5B and 6 is that the principal allosteric unit is a dimer. In this model the cooperative low-pH transition of the pH-rate profiles of kcat/Km, R1, and RH2O (Figures 5B and 6) would necessarily be interpreted in terms of two successive two-proton ionizations: (EH2)2 / (EH-)2 + 2H+ / (E2-)2 + 4H+. In this case the term 1 + [H+]4/Ka4 in eqs 7-9 is replaced by the term 1 + [H+]2/Ka22 + [H+]4/Ka12Ka22. The latter term reduces to the former if Ka2 , Ka1 (i.e., the pKa values are "crossed") and the product Ka1 × Ka2 in the latter is equal to Ka in the former. Crossing the pKa values by as little as 0.5 pH unit from each other is sufficient to render these two models kinetically indistinguishable. While these two potential models cannot be distinguished kinetically, they do place some constraints on the interpretation of the pH-rate data. In the present case, if the allosteric unit is indeed a dimer rather than a tetramer, then there must be two ionizable groups in each monomer, both of which must be deprotonated to trigger the transition from inactive to inactive conformation. A possible scenario is that the deprotonation of the zinc-bound water (pKa2) triggers a structural change in the dimer that allows a second, unidentified residue with a lower pKa (pKa1) to deprotonate in each subunit of the dimer. In this scenario, the true pKa of the zinc-bound water would be higher and the pKa of the unidentified residue lower than the kinetically determined pKa using eqs 7-9. Several additional lines of evidence strengthen the hypothesis that the allosteric unit of HICA is a dimer. First, the high-pH limb of the pH-rate profiles of R1 clearly shows a two-proton dependence. That is, two groups must be cooperatively protonated to generate the active species of the enzyme. Because the high-pH limb of R1 (Figure 6A) tracks the ionization state of the zinc-bound water (27), this suggests that an active enzyme species for HCO3- dehydration can be formed by the protonation of only two, and not four, of the zinc hydroxides in the biologically relevant unit of HICA. Similarly, the high-pH limb of RH2O (Figure 6B) suggests that only two proton transfer donors (17) need be protonated to generate an active species for proton transfer in the HCO3- dehydration reaction. Third, the HCO3inhibition of R1 and RH2O at chemical equilibrium (Figure 7) can be satisfactorily modeled only if it is assumed that the inhibited species binds noncompetitively to two molecules of bicarbonate, e.g., (E)2 + 2HCO3- / (E-HCO3-)2, where E2 is the catalytically active species. This model predicts inhibition behavior as described by eq 10 and fits the data in Figure 7 very well. Finally, the structures of HICA and ECCA both have one tight and one loose interface between monomers, the former corresponding to the dimerization interface and the latter to the tetramerization interface. This suggests that intersubunit communication is more likely within the tightly bound dimer. The tight dimerization interface is where the catalytic and noncatalytic sites are located, and Arg64, which is located on this interface, is a likely candidate for mediating intersubunit communication. The structural and kinetic data presented here provide a strong case that HICA and ECCA can adopt two alternative

Cronk et al. conformations and that bicarbonate ion binding to a noncatalytic site stabilizes the inactive conformation. Although neither HICA nor ECCA have been crystallized in an alternative conformation to those reported here, the kinetic evidence here strongly suggests that it must adopt an alternative conformation in a highly cooperative fashion. The principal structural features seen in the noncatalytic HCO3binding site for HICA and ECCA are shared with other members of the -CA class, suggesting that there are other members of this class that may also exhibit cooperative kinetics, including the CAs from P. purpureum and M. tuberculosis Rv3588c. The physiological role for the allosteric regulation of certain -CAs is not clear, but it has been shown that ECCA (37) and a -CA from yeast (38) are essential for aerobic growth of these organisms, and it has been suggested that CA may be necessary to provide HCO3for lipid biosynthesis. One might speculate that the allosteric regulation of -CAs is used to maintain a critical concentration of HCO3- for biosynthesis during periods of high growth rates.
