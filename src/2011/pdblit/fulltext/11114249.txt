Abstract The affinity and enantioselectivity have been determined for designed propranolol derivatives as ligands for Cel7A by capillary electrophoresis (CE) at pH 7.0. These results have been compared to measurements at pH 5.0. In agreement with previous studies, the affinity increased at the higher pH. However, the affinity was not as dependent of the ligand structure at pH 7.0 as at pH 5.0, and the selectivity was generally decreased. Instead, at pH 7.0, the changes in binding were mainly dependent on the presence of additional dihydroxyl groups, indicating an increased importance of the electrostatic interactions. To evaluate the pH dependent variations in binding, changes in both the ligand and in the enzyme had to be taken into account. To ensure that the ligands had the same charge in all measurements, pKa-values of all compounds were determined. The ligand­protein interaction has also been studied by inhibition experiments at both pHs to evaluate the specific binding to the active site when competing with the substrate p-nitrophenyl lactoside (pNPL). With support of docking computations we propose a hypothesis on the effect of the ligand structure and pH dependency of the binding and selectivity of amino alcohols to Cel7A. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction The use of different kinds of proteins as chiral selectors is a well established method of separating enantiomers [1]. In particular, the cellulase cellobiohydrolase I (Cel7A), has been shown to be enantiomerically selective towards several biologically active amino alcohols [2]. One approach has been to use Cel7A adsorbed to silica as a chiral stationary phase (CSP) and the retention of several -adrenoceptor antagonists has been studied in liquid chromatography [3]. Cel7A has also been used as a chiral additive in the background electrolyte (BGE) in capillary electrophoresis (CE) [4,5]. It has been shown that the retention of chiral substances depends on several factors such as pH, temperature, counter ions and ionic strength [6,7]. In this study we compare affinity and enantioselectivity at pH 5.0 and 7.0 using CE.

Cel7A is an extracellular, cellulose degrading enzyme (Mw 65 000 g/mol) produced by the filamentous fungi Hypocrea jecorina. This enzyme hydrolyses the -1,4 -glycosidic bond of cellulose from the reducing end producing the disaccharide cellobiose [8]. The enzyme has a two domain organisation consisting of one large catalytic domain (Mw 55 000 g/mol) linked to a small cellulose binding domain (CBD, Mw 10 000 g/mol) [9]. The enzyme has a pI of 3.9 and the mechanism is established with a pH optimum of 4­5 [10,11]. Also, the enzyme is known to suffer from product inhibition [12,13]. Previous studies have shown that propranolol has an inhibitory effect on the protein [14]. The crystal structure of (S)-propranolol in the active site of the protein has been determined by Xray crystallography at pH 7.0 [15]. To show the importance of interactions with the catalytic amino acid Asp214 [7], the enantioselectivity of structurally different amines and acids have been studied over a range of pH using both wild type and mutated Cel7A as a stationary phase, Also, the importance of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions at the selective and the non-selective sites for metoprolol, alprenolol and propranolol has previously been studied by HPLC and dis-

cussed using a two-site binding model (Bilangmuir model) [16]. In a recent study we designed new ligands (Fig. 1) based on the known crystal structures, aiming at diversity as well as a higher affinity to be able to study the enantioselectivity of Cel7A. Both affinity and selectivity were determined at pH 5.0 to study the protein interaction in relation to the structural changes of the ligands [17]. The aim of this study is to further investigate the effect of pH on affinity and enantioselectivity for the designed ligands, as well as to verify interactions with the active site of the enzyme through their ability to function as inhibitors. This is also correlated to defined structural changes in the ligands and therefore the importance of hydrophobic and electrostatic effect could be demonstrated. CE was used to determine acidity constants, pKavalues, for all substances to exclude the possibility of changes in ligand charges. Using this combined knowledge together with illustrative computational dockings, we provide a further insight into the role of pH in the ligand­protein interactions. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals rac-Propranolol (99%) and Bis­Tris (98%) were purchased from Sigma­Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and p-nitrophenyl lactoside from Sigma (Steinheim, Germany). Millipore quality (mQ) water was used throughout the experiments. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. All compounds in Fig. 1 were synthesised as described previously and 1­6, 8, 9 had a chemical purity of >98% as determined by NMR and 7 had a chemical purity of only 91%, due to decomposition, as determined by HPLC. Compound (R)-9 was synthesised as previously described, giving a yield of 35% (mp = 117.7­120.4  C, [ ]d20 = +5.5 ) and all enantiomers had an ee of >99% as determined by HPLC [17]. 2.2. Apparatus All CE experiments were performed on a Hewlett Packard3D Capillary Electrophoresis system (Agilent Technologies, Wald-

bronn, Germany) using ChemStation Version A.06.01 for system control, data collection and data analysis. Further treatment of the CE data was performed using GraphPad 3.02 (San Diego CA, USA). Microtiter plates (96-well) were from Nunc A/S (Roskilde, Denmark). For plate analysis a Packard SpectraCount BS1001 with program version 3.0.34 was used. All inhibition data analysis was performed with GraphPad version 4.0 (San Diego, CA, USA). A Shimadzu UV-2401 PC (Kyoto, Japan) and a 744 pH Meter (Metrohm Ltd., Herisau, Switzerland) were also used. 2.3. Partial-filling technique Separations were performed in silica fused capillaries (Polymicro Technologies, LLC, Phoenix, Arizona, USA), with a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-coating [18]. The dimensions of the capillaries were 33 cm in over all length (effective length 24.5 cm) and 50 m ID (OD 375 m). UV detection was carried out at 214 nm for 1­4, 204 nm for 5­6 and 254 nm for 7. 10 mM Bis­Tris/AcOH, pH 7.0, was used as BGE. 10 mmol Bis­Tris (base) was dissolved in 500 mL mQ water and titrated with AcOH to pH 7.0 and finally diluted to 1 L. The sample solutions, protein and BGE were hydrodynamically injected at the anodic part of the capillary at a pressure of 34.5 mbar (instrumental setting). A constant temperature of 25  C and a constant current of 2 A were used. Samples were dissolved in BGE at a concentration of 15 M, degassed and filtered through 0.45 m syringe filters prior to analysis. Protein was dissolved in BGE and concentration calculated from UV, using 280 = 78800 M-1 cm-1 [19]. Protein concentrations at pH 7.0 were 27 M for 5, 19 M for 7, 16 M for 1 and 3, 6 M for 4 and 6, and 4 M for 2. All measurements were made in triplicate and the mean values were used for calculation of Kd -values. Prior to each run the capillaries were rinsed 5 min with BGE. Migration times for each analyte were measured at 5 different plug lengths of protein, 0, 21, 42, 64, respectively, 85% of the effective length of the capillary (a pressure of 34.5 mbar for 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 s), keeping the protein concentration constant for each analyte. A plug of protein was first injected, followed by analyte

(5 s) and finally a short plug of BGE (5 s) to prevent backward diffusion. 2.4. pKa-measurements of the ligands CE was used to determine the pKa-values of all ligands [20] and the instrument used is described above. However, for this purpose uncoated capillaries (Polymicro Technologies, LLC, Phoenix, Arizona, USA) of a total length of 33 cm and an effective length of 24.5 cm (50 m ID, OD 375 m) were used. Prior to each analysis the capillaries were conditioned by flushing 5 min with 1.0 M NaOH, followed by mQ water for 2 min and BGE for 5 min. Finally, a voltage of 10 kV was applied for 120 s. This cycle was repeated before each run in order to maintain reproducible migration. During all experiments a constant voltage of 10 kV was applied and the sample tray was kept at 25  C with an external water bath. To cover the entire pH range, different BGEs had to be prepared. In all cases the ion strength was adjusted to 50 mM with addition of KCl. The buffers used were based on Bis­Tris (pH 5.5­7), Tris (pH 7.5­9) and ethanolamine (pH 9.5­10.5). Samples were prepared using 1 mM stock solutions of compound 1­9 in methanol. The solutions were diluted to 100 M with addition of the BGE. All samples contained 1% acetone in order to establish the electroosmotic flow (EOF). 2.5. Protein purification Cel7A was purchased as the enzyme mixture Celluclast® from Novozymes (Bagsvaerd, Denmark) and was purified in accordance with previously described methods [21]. The purity of the protein was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulphate­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS­PAGE). 2.6. Inhibition experiment The rate of production of p-nitrophenol (pNP) from pNPL was determined with Cel7A as the catalyst in the presence of (S)-1, (S)-2, (S)-8, (R)-9, (S)-9 and cellobiose as inhibitors. All experiments were performed using Microtiter plates (96-well) and the concentration of pNP was measured at 405 nm using a Packard SpectraCount BS1001 plate reader. The conditions were the following at pH 5.0: each well was fitted with 1.5 mM p-NPL, 150 M inhibitor and 4 M Cel7A in 50 mM Bis­Tris/AcOH buffer at a total volume of 100 L and the plates were incubated at 25  C for 0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min. At pH 7.0 the catalytic rates were determined using 1.5 mM p-NPL, 100 M of inhibitor, as well as 25 M for (S)-9, and 16 M Cel7A in 50 mM Bis­Tris/AcOH buffer at a total volume of 100 L. The plates were incubated at 25  C for 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min. 100 M 0.5 M Na2 CO3 was added to ensure deprotonation of the p-NP before the concentration of the formed product was determined. A standard curve was constructed using 100 L 0.01­0.20 mM solutions of p-NP in the same buffer as for the measurements and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm, after addition of 100 L of 0.5 M Na2 CO3 . All data were fitted by linear-regression.

2.7. Calculations The Kd of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of all compounds were calculated according to Eq. (1) [22]: 1  × r 2 × ldet dt = × Kd t0,det dn (1)

where r is the radius and ldet is the length of capillary to detection window, t0,det is the migration time of the analyte when no protein is present and d t/dn is the slope of the linear correlation between the differences in migration time of the analyte in analyses with and without selector, t (s), and the total amount of selector, n (mol Cel7A). To be able to compare the enantioselectivity of the analytes, the intrinsic selectivity, i , was used. This was calculated according to Eq. (2). i = Kd (R) Kd (S) (2)

The pKa was calculated from a nonlinear regression fit according to Eq. (3) using Graph Pad 3.02 (San Diego CA, USA): e = BH+ 1 + 10(pH-pKa) (3)

where e is the effective mobility, and BH+ is the mobility of the fully protonated base. The effective mobility, e , was calculated according to: e = leff Ltot V 1 1 - tm tEOF (4)

where leff = the effective length of the capillary; Ltot = total length of the capillary; V = voltage applied, tm = migration time of the analyte and tEOF = the migration time of the EOF marker. 2.8. Computational modelling The dockings were performed using Glide (version 4.0) [23], both as Standard-Precision Glide (SP) and Extra-Precision Glide (XP) dockings [24] and the ligand conformational search was performed using MacroModel (version 9.1) [25] in Maestro [26] (version 7.5). All ligand structures were minimised by the Multiple Minimisation method in water using the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFFs), followed by localizing the global minimum conformations, which were determined by using Monte Carlo Conformational Search (TCNR (Truncated Newton Conjugate Gradient), in water). The conformation with the lowest energy for each ligand was used in the docking computations. The protein structure used was obtained from a complex with (S)-9 (to be published by Fagerstr¨ m et al). The structure was o prepared before being used in Glide as follows: the ligand was structurally adjusted, hydrogens were added to the structure, the Co2+ were removed, Asp214 was protonated and the carboxylic group was rotated 180 , and either Glu212 or Glu217 were protonated on each oxygen atom alternatively.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Affinity and selectivity A method based on capillary electrophoresis, CE, were utilised to determine affinity constants as well as enantioselectivity. Using the partial-filling technique, only small amounts of both analyte and selector were needed. The robustness and repeatability of the method were excellent, considering that measurements made on the same substance at different occasions gave close to identical results. To obtain Kd -values of all (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of the compounds binding to Cel7A, migration times of the racemic substances were determined through a series of different plug lengths of selector (Cel7A) as shown in Fig. 2. As the binding strength of an analyte increased, the concentration of selector was decreased, keeping plug lengths constant. The differences in migration times with and without selector were plotted versus the amount of Cel7A as shown in Fig. 3. The amount of protein was calculated from the UV absorbance and therefore Kd -values are only related to the total protein concentration and not the activity of Cel7A. The Kd of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of all compounds were calculated according to Eq. (1). To verify the order of elution of the enantiomers, enan-

tiomerically enriched samples were run, and it was shown that the (R)-enantiomer of all compounds were eluted first at both pH 5.0 and pH 7.0. However, neither compound 8, nor 9, could be dissolved in BGE at sufficiently high concentrations at pH 7.0 to allow comparative analyses. Also, to avoid backward migration of the ligand together with the enzyme, the increased affinity demanded too low protein concentrations to ensure an excess of protein as compared to the amount of ligand. All compounds showed a significant increase in affinity at higher pH (Table 1). However, compared with compounds 1, 3, 5 and 7, compounds 2, 4 and 6, containing the dihydroxy functionality, did not show the expected increase in affinity. Throughout the series, the only obvious structural modification affecting binding strength is the addition of hydroxyl groups and unexpected similarities in affinity were observed in contrast to at pH 5.0. This indicates that the electrostatic interactions are of greater importance at pH 7.0 than changes influencing the hydrophobic effects. To further elucidate the effect of pH on binding, the enantioselectivity of the analytes were compared using the intrinsic selectivity, i , which was calculated according to Eq. (2) and the results are given in Table 1. At pH 5.0 a higher affinity resulted in an increased selectivity, with the only exception of 7. All structural modifications of the ligand had an effect on both affinity and selectivity. On the other hand, at pH 7.0, the enantioselectivity was greatly reduced for all compounds, even if the affinity was increased as compared to pH 5.0. The structure dependency was greatly reduced at pH 7.0 and the main difference, in both affinity and enantioselectivity, was between compounds with or without the dihydroxy functionality. For all compounds having the unsubstituted isopropyl group (1, 3, 5 and 7) the selectivity decreased when compared to the selectivity at pH 5 and was of equal value throughout the series. The anthracene analogue 7 exhibited a surprisingly low i value at pH 5.0, in relation to its comparatively high affinity, and the same result was observed at pH 7. Compounds containing the dihydroxy functionality showed a similar behaviour, as to those without, and even if both affinity and selectivity varied at pH 5, the similarities through the series were striking at pH 7 showing a reduced enantioselectivity.

3.3. Inhibition The affinity measurements by CE show a total of all specific and non-specific bindings since determination of the exact binding site is not possible with this method. The ligand­protein interplay is not restricted to binding only to the active site and therefore it is necessary to confirm the interaction with the active site. In earlier studies it has been shown that propranolol also has a weak enantioselective binding site at the CBD [28]. Therefore, we can not assume a complete correlation between affinity and inhibition. However, this second selective site has a minor contribution at pH 6.8 and no measurable selectivity at pH close to 5 and it has been shown that a good correlation between inhibition constants and enantioselectivity is obtained for propranolol (1) [14]. Thus, simple inhibitory studies were performed on selected ligands (Table 3). In previous studies of enzyme activity of Cel7A, pnitrophenyl- -d-cellobioside has been used as substrate [29]. However, at lower substrate concentrations, the cellobiose produced may reach critical levels, inhibiting the catalytic reactivity of the enzyme. To avoid this situation, p-nitrophenyl-d-lactoside (p-NPL) was used as substrate. As references, cellobiose and propranolol were used, since inhibition by both compounds has been shown previously (Figs. 5 and 6.). Inhibition was studied at both pH 5.0 and pH 7.0 in Bis­Tris/AcOH. To show the reduction in catalytic activity, the amount of p-NP produced was studied by UV absorbance. The activity of the enzyme is reported as rate of substrate con-

One reason for this change in selectivity could be the fact that the protein is believed to get a second catalytic amino acid at the active site deprotonated at pH 7, as compared with at pH 5. This will affect the binding mode of the ligands, which may be why the selectivity is reduced for all compounds even though the affinity is increased. Another plausible reason is a change in the degree of protonation of the amines and together with the reduced solubility of compound 2, 8 and 9 at pH 7.0 this prompted us to determine pKa of all substances. 3.2. Ligand pKa Capillary electrophoresis is a convenient method for the determination of acidity constants. Thus, pKa was calculated for all compounds using Eq. (3), through experimental determination of the effective mobilities, e (Eq. (4)). A great advantage of this method is the small amounts of compound needed. Furthermore, the method shows a good reproducibility. The nonlinear regression gives an excellent fit for all compounds (Fig. 4) and the values are reported in Table 2. For comparison, the pKa value of our reference substance propranolol was in good agreement with previous determinations (pKa 9.5) [27]. The results showed that the pKa-values for all compounds with the dihydroxy functionality were 1.5 units lower than for the isopropyl analogues. This indicates that compound 2, 4, 6 and 9 are partially deprotonated at pH 7.0. However, the major amount will be present as the ionized species, why this is not believed to be the main reason for the changes in binding. With this result at hand, our attention was focused on the protein itself.

sumption. The substrate concentrations were in excess, but kept relatively low to optimize the study of the competitive inhibition and it was noticed that the low affinity ligands only showed a weak but still significant inhibition at pH 5.0. However, the stronger binding ligands exhibited a clear inhibitory effect even at lower ligand concentrations and higher substrate concentrations. As expected, the ligand with the highest affinity also showed the strongest inhibition of the enzyme activity. At pH 7.0 the activity of the enzyme is reduced since this is outside the pH optimum and therefore the enzyme concentration was increased at this pH. In these measurements no significant activity was shown in the presence of 9 when the same concentrations were used for all ligands. However, keeping the same conditions and only lowering the ligand concentration from 100 M to 25 M gave a low activity which could be measured. 3.4. Ligand docking The effect of protonation of the three catalytically active amino acids on the ligand binding to the protein was examined by docking computations. The X-ray crystal structure of a complex containing (S)-9 was used for our purposes. As available crystal structures contained (S)-enantiomers, this was the only enantiomer of the ligands to be docked for comparative reasons. Analysis of the X-ray crystal structure of Cel7A with (S)-propranolol bound suggested that Asp214 is the only protonated catalytic amino acid at pH 7.0 and the same could be concluded from the structure with (S)-9. The pKa value of Asp may range 2.0­9.9 depending on the environment in the protein [30]. The increase in pKa shown for Asp214 is not uncommon for aspartates when other carboxylic acids are within hydrogen bonding distance. Therefore, Asp214 is kept protonated in all docking experiments. It has been shown that the protonation state of the catalytic site changes twice, at pH 5 and pH 7 (personal communication from professor G. Johansson, Uppsala University). To model the effect of a second protonated catalytic amino acid we have performed docking experiments with either Glu212 or Glu217 in a protonated state and compared to our experimental results. The results show a general increase in the number of possible poses of the ligands, indicating weaker due to reduced hydrogen bonding. The docking experiments with Glu212 gave two results, protonation of the oxygen pointing

towards Asp214 gave a fair docking, but this protonation interferes with the hydrogen-bond towards Asp214 and is less likely in terms of lost interactions both with Asp214 and the ligand. When Glu212 was protonated at the oxygen towards Ser174 a rather scattered pattern of the ligand poses was observed. This oxygen is also expected to have hydrogen-bonds to the alcohol at the stereogenic centre of the ligands and therefore some effects on the selectivity would be expected. In mechanistic studies of the enzyme it has been determined that Glu212 acts as a nucleophile in the degradation of cellulose, while Glu217 acts as an acid/base with Asp214 present to maintain the correct protonaiton state of Glu212. The pH optimum of Cel7A is at pH 4­5 and the catalytic activity is strongly reduced at pH 7.0, where the deprotonation of the acid/base catalyst (Glu217) is expected to occur [10]. In the case of Glu217, protonation of the oxygen expected to have hydrogen bonding to the ammonium, the strong electrostatic interaction with the ammonium was lost and the ammonium was instead moved towards Asp173. Considering the experimental affinities and selectivity, this is rather unlikely. However, when Glu217 was protonated at the oxygen pointing away from the ligand, several poses from each ligand showed a rather good positioning in agreement with the crystal structure. However, a difference was noticed between the ligands with higher affinity (8 and 9) and the low affinity ligands 1, 3 and 5. The larger ring systems in 8 and 9 were positioned closer to Trp367 indicating a second aromatic interaction, which could explain the increase in affinity. This additional interaction resulted in very similar positioning of these ligands and the only difference was the torsion about the bonds in the side chain. Since 8 and 9 have a similar positioning, only the additional hydrogen bonding in 9 contribute to the increased affinity. Neither is the experimental selectivity as greatly affected as for the other compounds, which would be reasonable if the (R)-enantiomer has similar interactions. For the low affinity ligands a much greater flexibility was shown, in particular for 3 and 5. In these cases the main interaction focus was about the stereogenic centre and the ammonium, and even at these positions some variations were observed indicating a weaker ligand­protein interaction. On the other hand, 2, 4 and 6, containing the dihydroxy functionality, were more strongly positioned with respect to the side chain in relation to the catalytic amino acids and the aromatic system was positioned to optimise the interactions with Trp376 (Fig. 7). This is explained by further possible interactions to other amino acids such as Asp173, primarily through plausible hydrogen bonding with the additional hydroxyl groups. This fits well with the similar increase in affinity when comparing 1, 3 and 5 to their hydroxyl equivalencies. However, in the docking experiments, 4 and 6 were not as affected with respect to positioning of the ring system while compound 2 generally assumed a positioning of the naphthyl closer to the second tryptophane, Trp367, similar to the phenanthryl in 8 and 9. This effect was not observed for compound 1 where the interaction with Trp376 seems to be the only main interaction in the tunnel. Compound 3 and 5, on the other hand, did not seem to be as strongly positioned by this interaction (Fig. 8), why the inter-

actions with the catalytic amino acids become more important. This is in accordance with the greater increase in selectivity, for compound 4 and 6 as compared to 3 and 5. The addition of the dihydroxyl groups retains the side chain, containing the stereogenic centre, in a fixed position. The computations suggested that compound 7 could adopt a new orientation as shown in Fig. 9, where the straight aromatic ring-system was arranged in the catalytic cleft, with the side

chain directed out towards the entrance tunnel. This could be the reason to the generally low selectivity seen at both pH 5.0 and 7.0. Such an arrangement would not be possible for the phenanthryl, since this type of ring-system would not be able to fit as easily into the cavity. In all cases, both the general positioning of the ligand and the position of the stereogenic centre were affected in a way which correlates well with the experimental data obtained at pH 5.0. Hence, the increase in affinity does not show an equivalent increase in selectivity for the high affinity ligands 2, 7, 8 and 9, while the low affinity ligands (3 and 5) show a strong increase in selectivity when the affinity is increased through the addition of the dihydroxyl functionality (4 and 6). 4. Conclusion In conclusion, we have determined Kd -values for a series of propranolol derivatives at pH 7.0 and compared them to Kd values previously measured at pH 5.0. We have shown that a strong increase in affinity of the positively charged ligands occurs at increased pH and the elution order of the enantiomers is the same as at pH 5.0. On the other hand, a general decrease in selectivity and less diversity in both affinity and selectivity was observed at pH 7.0. To exclude the possible effect of changes in ligand charges at the higher pH, CE was used to determine pKa for all substances. It was determined that all ligands were charged within the pH-range studied. To show that the main interaction occurred at the active site of Cel7A the ligand­protein interactions were studied through inhibition of the enzyme catalysis. A strong inhibition was shown at both pH 5.0 and pH 7.0, which verifies an interaction with the catalytic site. The differences in the degree of protonation in the catalytic amino acids at pH 5.0 and pH 7.0 were examined in docking experiments. The poses of the ligands show that protonation of Glu217 gave an interaction pattern which fitted the exper-

imental results very well with respect to affinity and gives a possible explanation to the selectivity. However, at pH 7.0 a more unselective binding seems to take place, which partly may be due to increased importance of the electrostatic interactions and generally increased charge of the protein.
