Abstract We compared the effect of mecamylamine and fluoxetine on the hippocampal noradrenaline ZNA. release evoked by nicotine in vitro. Nicotine Z100 mM. increased the basal release of w 3 HxNA from rat hippocampal slices. This effect was blocked by the potent nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine in a dose-dependent manner ZIC 50 s 0.19 mM.. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ZSSRI. fluoxetine also antagonised the response to nicotine in a dose-dependent manner with a similar strength ZIC 50 s 0.57 mM.. Our data indicate that fluoxetine has nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist effect in the central nervous system. The possible clinical significance of this finding is discussed.

It has been shown that nicotine and nicotinic agonists increase the hippocampal noradrenaline ZNA. release both in vitro w1,3,13,17x and in vivo w2,9x. Previously we studied this phenomenon on rat hippocampal slices. We found that nicotinic agonists can increase the basal release of w 3 HxNA through stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ZnAChRs. consisting of probably a 3 and b 2 subunits w14,17x. In a subsequent study we showed that this nicotinic receptor-mediated response can be blocked by desipramine, nisoxetine and nomifensine w6x suggesting that these NA andror dopamine ZDA. uptake blockers possess nAChRs antagonist properties. On the basis of this finding the assumption arose that other monoamine uptake blockers may have similar effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the selective serotonin Z5-HT. reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, this widely used antidepressant drug, has any effect on the nicotinic agonist-evoked NA release. Male Wistar rats Z150­200 g. were killed by decapitation. The hippocampi were prepared and sliced into 0.4 mm thick sections. Slices were loaded for 45 min with w 3 HxNA at a concentration of 10 mCirml. After the incubation four slices were put into each chamber of a microvolume perfusion system w16x. The preparation was superfused with Krebs solution Zcomposition in mM: NaCl 113,

Subsequently, ten 3-min fractions were collected. Nicotine was added from the 3rd fraction and maintained throughout the experiments; fluoxetine was present in the medium from the beginning of preperfusion. Mecamylamine was added from the first fraction. At the end of experiments the slices were removed from the chamber and were homogenized in 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. A 0.5 ml aliquot of the superfusate or 0.1 ml of the tissue supernatant was added to 2 ml of scintillation cocktail ZUltima Gold, Packard.. Radioactivity was measured with a Packard 1900 TR liquid scintillation counter and was expressed in Bqrg tissue. The fractional release ZFR. was calculated ZFR s released radioactivityractual tissue content.. FR data were normalized to decrease variance between subjects.

Comparison of areas was performed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test, IC 50 values were calculated by a nonlinear regression ZInplot program..

Mecamylamine was obtained from Erypharm Italiana. w 3 HxNA Z37 MBq, 30­50 Cirmmol. was obtained from Amersham.

Nicotine at a concentration of 100 mM produced an excess release over the basal efflux of w 3 HxNA ZAUC 3 ­ 7 s 318.38 " 20.12%.. This response was completely blocked by mecamylamine ZAUC 3 ­ 7 s 11.81 " 8.78%, P - 0.001. and fluoxetine ZAUC 3 ­ 7 s 18.63 " 17.44%, P - 0.001. at a concentration of 10 mM ZFig. 1..

Mecamylamine inhibited the nicotine-evoked NA release with an IC 50 value of 0.19 mM. Fluoxetine was almost as effective as mecamylamine, its IC 50 value was 0.57 mM ZFig. 2.. It has been shown that uptake blocker-type antidepressant drugs have also some direct effect on different receptors. This affinity could account for their clinical side effects. Fluoxetine is one of the most frequently used antidepressant drugs. It is a potent and selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor ZIC 50 s 6.8 nM for 5-HT. with a selec-

tivity ratio of 54 and 735 for NA and DA, respectively w5x. Although it was described that fluoxetine in vivo produced subsensitivity to the hypothermic effect of nicotine w4x, up to now no evidence has suggested that it could exert any effect on nAChRs in the central nervous system ZCNS.. In this work we found that fluoxetine, similarly to mecamylamine, inhibited the nicotine-evoked increase of hippocampal NA release in a dose-dependent manner. From this point of view fluoxetine behaved like desipramine, nisoxetine and nomifensine in our previous experiments w6x It has been reported that the nicotine-induced exocytotic release of noradrenaline from isolated perfused guinea-pig heart was inhibited by desipramine and nisoxetine w12x. Desipramine could inhibit DMPPevoked depolarization and noradrenaline release in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells w15x and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that desipramine inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine receptors w11x. Behavioural effects of nicotine were antagonized by cocaine analogs in mice and receptor binding studies showed that cocaine analogs compete for the mecamylamine binding site with high affinity w7x. These results indicate that monoamine uptake blockers with different chemical structure and selectivity interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors which results in nAChR antagonist effect. This seems to be true also for fluoxetine but further investigations are necessary to clarify the mechanism and nature of this antagonism. Is there a clinical significance of this finding? In an open study of depressed patients the m ean plasmarcerebrospinal fluid ratio for fluoxetine was about 30 w8x. During fluoxetine treatment the plasma concentration is 1­2 mM w10x that is the CSF concentration is about 0.03­0.06 mM. We found that fluoxetine decreased the nicotinic agonist-evoked response with an IC 50 value of 0.57 mM. This concentration is approximately one order of

magnitude higher than the usual CSF concentration therefore under normal conditions the nAChR antagonist effect of fluoxetine is not predominating. However, under certain conditions Ze.g. decreased metabolism, drug interactions, attempted suicide, etc.. it may emerge since the difference between these concentration ranges is minimal. In conclusion, our data indicate that fluoxetine can inhibit nAChRs in the CNS which may have clinical significance under special conditions.
