Introduction. The SANT (Swi3, Ada2, N-Cor, and TFIIIB) module was first described as a putative DNAbinding domain with strong similarity to the helix-turnhelix DNA binding domain of Myb-related proteins.1­3 The X-ray structure of the C-terminal one third portion of the ATPase ISWI of Drospohila melanogaster, containing both SANT and SLIDE (SANT-Like ISWI Domain), confirmed the overall helix-turn-helix structural architecture of SANT as well as SLIDE.4 However, the DNAcontacting residues in Myb are not conserved in SANT and the structurally corresponding residues in the ISWI SANT domain are acidic, and therefore incompatible with DNA interaction. Recent studies suggested that SANT domains might be a histone-tail-binding module,5 including the DNA binding SANT domain of c-Myb.6 Here we present the X-ray structure of Xenopus laevis ISWI SANT domain, derived from limited proteolysis of a C-terminal fragment of ISWI protein. Materials and Methods. Identification of the SANTContaining Domain by Proteolysis: A fragment of Xenopus ISWI corresponding to amino acids 724 through 955 [Fig. 1(A)] was produced in bacteria and purified under denaturing conditions as previously described.7 The purified recombinant protein was renatured by dialysis as follows. First, the protein was dialyzed 1 h versus 1M urea, 2M NaCl, 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol. Next, dialysis buffer was changed to 0.5M urea, 2M NaCl, 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, and dialysis was continued for 3 h. Dialysis was performed overnight with buffer containing no urea. Finally, sodium chloride concentration was reduced by dialysis versus 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.9, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. Renatured Xenopus ISWI fragment (1.25 mg/mL) and papain (2 lg/mL) were incubated on ice for various times in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl [Fig. 1(B)]. The major fragment resulting from this proteolysis experiment was analyzed by Edman sequencing. Two potential amino termini were assigned corresponding to valine 737 (actual Edman sequence­­VSEPKV) and glutamic acid 739 (actual Edman sequence­­EPKVPK). Mass spectrometry analysis assigned two potential carC V 2007 WILEY-LISS, INC.

boxyl termini corresponding to isoleucine 900 and to leucine 918. In the study described here, we focused our structural analysis on the smaller fragment. The fragment includes the entirety of the classic defined $50-residue SANT motif. Crystallography: Residues 737­900 of Xenopus ISWI protein were fused to the sequence LEHHHHHH at the Cterminus and expressed in a pET expression vector with an N-terminal methionine. Bacterial cultures carrying the expression plasmid were induced with IPTG at 228C for 16 h. The protein was purified with a 5-mL Ni2þ chelating column (GE-Healthcare), a 6-mL UnoS column (Bio-RAD) and a Superdex S75 column (GE-Healthcare). The protein was concentrated to 60 mg/mL in 20 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol. Crystals were obtained by the hanging drop method with 0.1M Hepes pH 6.8, 42.5% PEG 3350, and 0.2M MgCl2 as the mother liquor. The presence of MgCl2 is essential for crystallization. Crystals were protected by paraffin oil before flash freezing in a cold nitrogen stream. Selenomethionine incorporated crystals did not yield sufficient phasing power as the protein contains only one SeMet at position 884, which is located in the flexible C-terminal helix aG (see below). Molecular replacement was performed using residues 734­845 of the structure of Drosophila mela-

Two solutions were found using CNS8 with Pattersoncorrelation refinement, treating residues 734­799 and 800­845 of the search model as separate rigid bodies. The structure was refined using CNS (Table I). Results and Discussion. The SANT domain of Xenopus ISWI (residues 737­900 identified by limited proteolysis) was crystallized with two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit [Figs. 2(A­C)]. The overall monomeric structure consists of seven helices (aA to aG) and an N-terminal 3-residue 310 helix, forming a L-shape ° single domain with dimensions of 55 3 40 3 25 A3 [Fig. 2(D)]. The N-terminal part of the molecule is largely responsible for the L-appearance: the N-terminal loop with six-prolines forms a nearly 908 bend at the double proline P748-P749. Helix aA and its following loop lie nearly perpendicular to helices aB and aC. The C-terminal part of the molecule is a tightly packed 3-helix bundle (aD, aE, and aF), which corresponds to the classically defined SANT motif spanning some 50 amino acids.10 The N- and C-terminal halves of each protomer are packed through a hydrophobic core [Fig. 2(B)], mediated by many aromatic residues from the N-terminal 310 helix (F757, F759, and F760), helices aD (W828, F833, and F836) and aF (Y866, F870, and W871). The importance of these intramolecular interactions is supported by the observation that most residues involved are invariant or conserved among the ISWI SANT sequences examined (Supplemental Figure S1). We suggest that the two halves behave as a single, folded structural module, explaining its resistance to proteolysis [Fig. 1(B)].

Except for the last helix aG, the two protomers in the asymmetric unit are very similar: least squares superpo° sition gave a root-mean-square-deviation of 0.55 A for 104 pairs of Ca atoms (residues 739­878). While helix aG is ordered in molecule A [green in Fig. 2(B)], which loosely packed against the 3-helix bundle, the corresponding helix is unstructured in molecule B (light blue) with residual, disconnected densities. This flexibility might be due to the missing C-terminal SLIDE domain (see below) or an indication of flexibility. Structural Comparison of Xenopus ISWI Structure with that of Drosophila: The structured portion of the Drosophila protein contains an additional N-terminal helix [red in Fig. 3(A)] and a C-terminal SLIDE domain.4 The red helix reposes on the concave L-surface. The residues flanking the red helix are disordered in the Drosophila structure. The interaction between the red helix and the rest of the protein is primarily mediated via a nonconserved residue corresponding to F765 of Xenopus ISWI, which complements a small area on the concave L-surface [Fig. 2(D), left panel]. The concave L-surface is highly polarized, containing many invariant or conserved charged residues including solvent exposed R747, R873, and E876 [Fig. 2(D), left panel], suggesting that they are involved in a conserved function and these invariant resDOI 10.1002/prot

Fig. 2. Structure of Xenopus SANT. (A) A dimer of SANT domain formed in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The dimer interface is formed between the N-terminal Pro-rich loop­­hydrophobic interactions involving proline residues (P743, P746, P748, and P749) and helix aA (Tyr775 and Tyr781) - and the helix aD (two salt bridges between invariant Arg803 of one protomer and invariant Asp804 of another protomer). The Stokes radius of the domain was consistent with a solution dimer: the 21-kDa protein eluted from S75 gel filtration column with apparent molecular weight of 41 ° kDa. The total area of dimer interface of 707 A2 is within the limits, though at the lower end, of the 32 homodimers examined.9 (B) A 908 rotated view from panel A. A Mg2þ ion, required for crystallization, is bound at the loop region between helices aE and aF.

idues in the Drosophila ISWI do not contact the redflagged helix. In the Drosophila ISWI structure,4 the structurally similar SANT and SLIDE domains are connected by a continuous long helix [Fig. 3(A)]. In our Xenopus structure, the proteolysis-derived fragment was cleaved right in the middle of the helix and the resulting shorter helix aG is ordered in one protomer and disordered in the other [Fig. 2(B)]. This observation indicates that the long aG could become unstructured to allow the individual, structurally similar domains to significantly move with respect to each other, reminiscent of the textbook example of the conformational changes in calmodulin-target interactions.12­15 Calmodulin has two domains, each consisting of a pair of EF-hand

motifs joined by a long flexible helix. Upon binding to the C-terminal a-helix of a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, the long helix linking the two EF-hands unwinds and folds back onto itself, allowing the two halves of calmodulin to clamp down around the target helix. Structural Comparison with c-Myb: The c-Myb transcriptional factor, a proto-oncogene, has three consecutive Nterminal SANT-type repeats (R1, R2, R3), each repeat containing a 3-helix bundle. The second and third helices of the R2 and R3 form a canonical helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif with the third helix being a recognition helix that is closely packed in the DNA major groove.2 We compared our Xenopus SANT helices (aD, aE, and aF) with that of the X-ray structure of c-Myb R2R3

the cellular predecessor. Recently, Mo et al. showed that, in addition to the recognition of cis-regulatory Myb-binding sites on DNA, the cellular c-Myb R2R3, but not its leukemogenic v-Myb cousin, interacts with the N-terminal tail of histone H3.6 The three mutations­­affecting the ability of v-Myb to interact with histone­­are located in the R2 repeat, replacing hydrophobic side chains I91, L106, and V117 by N, H, and D, respectively. Structural mapping showed that these three critical amino acid substitutions are located on the opposite side of Myb that faces away from the DNA [Fig. 3(C)]. A surface groove in c-Myb is evident that could be the binding groove for histone H3 peptide. One interesting finding of the comparison is that the position of Mg2þ ion in the SANT domain is equivalent to that of a sodium ion (Naþ) in the c-Myb R2 or R3 structure [Fig. 3(B), middle panel], interacting mainly through main chain atoms. While its importance is currently unclear, other than the essence for the crystallization, we suggest that the ion binding site may be a docking site for the histone H3 N-terminus. The main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms could form a hydrogen bond ``cage'' that recogþ nizes the amino (NH3 ) terminus of H3, as observed in PHD finger and H3 peptide interactions.16,17 Conclusions. We have described the crystallographic structure of the conserved region of the Xenopus ISWI SANT domain. The majority of the conserved residues are involved in structural stability, formation of a concave L-surface and a convex acidic surface that might provide a binding surface for highly basic histone tails.
