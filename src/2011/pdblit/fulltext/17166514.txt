To understand the principles underlying protein folding, many molecular modeling methods are being developed for predicting functional positions. In this work, fully flexible dinucleotides d(pApA), d(pApC), d(pApG), d(pApT), d(pCpA), d(pCpC), d(pCpG), d(pCpT), d(pGpA), d(pGpC), d(pGpG), d(pGpT), d(pTpA), d(pTpC), d(pTpG), and d(pTpT) were first docked onto the surface of scorpion polypeptide toxins (LqhIT2, PDB ID:2I61) and homology modeled ANEPIII. Automated docking was able to identify sites on scorpion polypeptide toxins where favorable nucleotide interactions can occur, and those sites were in agreement with the mutation data of this protein published recently [I. Karbat, R. Kahn, L. Cohen, N. Ilan, N. Gilles, G. Corzo, O. Froy, M. Gur, G. Albrecht, S.H. Heinemann, D. Gordon, M. Gurevitz, The unique pharmacology of the scorpion alpha-like toxin Lqh3 is associated with its flexible C-tail, Febs J 274 (2007) 1918­1931].

Recognition of functional sites is one of the key aspects of genomic DNA annotation [2]. A huge number of methods have been developed so far to address this problem. To understand the principles underlying protein folding, many molecular modeling methods are being developed for structural and functional site prediction. Attempts to determine the rules of this recognition began in the 1970s [3]. The recognition of a specific nucleotide sequence by a DNA- or RNA-binding protein is determined by atomic interactions between amino acids and nucleotides. Of all possible types of interaction, hydrogen bonds between amino acids and base edges were shown to be the most relevant [3,4]. Most Hbonds involve protein side-chains and contribute to the protein specificity, while interactions between nucleotides and the protein backbone seem to be important for the stabilization and orientation of the complex [5]. However, over the last decade, novel technologies have been developed to identify high affinity DNA and RNA sequences (ligands) for a wide variety of different targets, including nucleic acid binding proteins, peptides and small organic molecules (for review, see [6­8]). Among these technologies are the following: SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) [9], SAAB (Selected And Amplified Binding site imprint assay), REPSA (Restriction Endonuclease Protection Selection and Amplification) [10], CASTing (Cyclical Amplification and Selection of Targets), and other binding site selection procedures [11]. In general,

in vitro genetic analysis of the structural and functional properties of many nucleic acids is enhanced by the availability of methods for the amplification of nucleic acid sequences. Selected affinity-enriched sequences from combinatorial libraries are widely used for functional site recognition and site activity prediction. For example, analysis of the selected randomized ribosome binding sites in Escherichia coli with the determined translational yield of each site has enabled the calculation of a weight matrix for prediction of the translational yield on the sequence of ribosome binding sites [12]. The novel class of exonic splicing enhancers recognized by SR protein has been identified by using SELEX-like technologies [13]. The models reconcile hydrogen-bonded adenine recognition as well as ligand insertion and may explain the preference which the protein exhibits for adenine residues in the binding with DNA [14]. The importance of hydrogen bonding in base recognition (between deoxyguanosine residues and cyclic peptides) of the intercalating drug actinomycin has been reported by others [15]. Based on above, the principle for a computer modeling of the dinucleotides docking to protein is consistent with SELEX. Those sixteen fully flexible dinucleotides d(pApA), d(pApC), d(pApG), d(pApT), d(pCpA), d(pCpC), d(pCpG), d(pCpT), d(pGpA), d(pGpC), d(pGpG), d(pGpT), d(pTpA), d(pTpC), d(pTpG), and d(pTpT) were docked onto the surface of scorpion polypeptide toxins (LqhIT2, PDB ID:2I61and ANEPIII). Autodocking was able to identify sites on LqhIT2 where favorable interactions with nucleotides can occur, and those sites were in agreement with recently published LqhIT2 protein mutation data. By analyzing the phosphates of the docked

dinucleotides, we developed a model indicating where the functional structure site is located. We have also explored the possible DNA binding sites of the ANEPIII functional domain by docking sixteen dinucleotides to homology modeled ANEPIII. Simulation results suggested that dinucleotides docking is a molecular modeling method that could be developed for protein functional site recognition. Materials and methods Homology model of the ANEPIII. The results of the protein­protein BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search for a suitable template structure related to the target sequence (ANEPIII) showed that scorpion toxin from Leiurus Quinquestriatus Hebraeus (LqhIT2, PDB ID:2I61) chain A with an 88% sequence similarity was the most suitable template for modeling [16,17]. The homology model of the ANEPIII was generated using the ESyPred3D server [18]. Four disulphide bonds between Cys10 and Cys69, Cys14 and Cys35, Cys21 and Cys42, Cys25 and Cys44 were assigned employing the Biopolymer module in Sybyl 6.91 software package [19] on a Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) Fuel workstation under Irix6.5 platform. Energy minimization of the final structure was applied in three rounds. Partial charges were assigned to the protein after adding all the hydrogen atoms (residues Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg were considered ionized while all His were considered neutral by default), employing the Amber7 FF99 force field implemented in the Sybyl software package. In the first round, constraints to heavy atoms were applied, allowing mobility of all hydrogens. In the second energy minimization round, only the backbone chain was constrained, allowing the side chains to move. In the third energy minimization round, only alpha-C atoms were constrained, allowing the other atoms to move. Both energy minimization rounds were carried out using both steepest descent and conjugate gradient protocols. The final refined model was evaluated by the Procheck program. As shown in the Ramachandran plot, 85.4% of the residues are in the core region and 14.6% in the allowed region. No residue was found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot suggesting that no residue has a disallowed conformation. Automated docking. The AutoDock 3.05[20] was used to perform docking calculations. The sixteen different fully flexible 50 -phosphorylated dinucleotides that were docked to the entire surface of the LqhIT2 and ANEPIII, respectively, are as follows: d(pApA), d(pApC), d(pApG),d(pApT), d(pCpA), d(pCpC), d(pCpG), d(pCpT), d(pGpA), d(pGpC), d(pGpG), d(pGpT), d(pTpA), d(pTpC), d(pTpG), and d(pTpT). Those sixteen dinucleotides were built in the B-form conformation with the Sybyl software package [19] and minimized using the Tripos force field and assigned charges using the Gasteiger­Hückel method. Flexible torsions in the ligands were assigned with the Biopolymer module and all dihedral angles were allowed to rotate freely. The graphical front-end, AutoDockTools, was used to add polar hydrogens and partial charges for protein using the Kollman United Atom charges. Atomic solvation parameters and fragmental volumes for the proteins were assigned using the addsol utility in the program package. The docking procedure was applied to the whole protein target, without imposing the binding site (``blind docking"). A 45 Â 45 Â 50 Å grid box with a grid spacing of 0.375 Å was generated for LqhIT2 and ANEPIII that was large enough to cover the entire surface of the protein. Affinity grid fields were generated using the auxiliary program AutoGrid3.0. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) was used to find the appropriate binding positions, orientations, and conformations of the ligands. Default parameters were used, except for the number of generations which was set at 100. The resulting data were taken from docking experiments in which the lowest total docking energy was obtained.

Results and discussion Dinucleotides docking to LqhIT2 and contrastive analysis with mutagenesis studies of LqhIT2 Overall molecular and crystal structure of LqhIT2 The overall structure of the Scorpion depressant toxins (LqhIT2, PDB ID:2I61), 61 amino acid long polypeptides, that shows high preference for insect voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs), has a flat T-shape with dimensions of 27 Å Â 27 Å Â 17 Å and can be divided roughly into two perpendicular globular entities: the first incorporates the conserved a/b-core that typifies Nav scorpion toxins (core-globule), and the second incorporates the N and C terminal regions (NC-globule; Fig. 1). The core-globule is composed of an a-helix (residues 18-27) packed against a three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (residues 1­2, 31­34, and 43­47) and is stabilized by three disulfide bridges (Cys14­Cys35, Cys21­Cys42, and Cys25­Cys44). A forth disulfide bridge between Cys10 and Cys60 connects the C-tail with the N-terminal turn (residues 6­10). Two elongated grooves are formed at the intersection of the core and NC-globules. The N-groove appears at the region that precedes the a-helix, and the C-groove incorporates the loop penultimate to the C tail (Fig. 1). The surface topology at the N-groove region in LqhIT2 appears as a narrow saddle-shaped cavity, which occupies approximately half of the molecule perimeter. It is confined from one side by residues 13­17 of the loop preceding the a-helix and residues 39 and 40 of the loop connecting the second and third b-strands, and from the other side by Arg6, Asp8, and the solvent-exposed disulfide bridge Cys10­Cys60. The base of the cavity is hydrophobic in nature due to Val12 and the long aliphatic moiety of Lys11 that forms its surface. The unique conformation of Lys11 is maintained by multiple interactions between its charged amine moiety and part of its long aliphatic moiety with the aromatic rings of Tyr3 and Trp53. A similar amino acid cluster composed of a positive residue flanked by two aromatic rings is conserved in all scorpion b-toxins

excluding the excitatory toxins [21]. In most of these toxins the N and C-terminal loops are interconnected by a forth disulfide bridge generating a structural entity that protrudes from the core motif. Dinucleotides docking to LqhIT2 AutoDock3.05 was chosen because it used a fully flexible ligands in its docking algorithm (although it is still docked to a rigid protein) and provided satisfactory results in docking six dinucleotides to HIV-1 integrase [22­24]. From the 16 flexible dinucleotides docking simulation, we found that the low-energy conformational structures are mainly located in three regions, in the C-groove, the N-groove and between the a-helix and the bsheet (Fig. 2); mutagenesis studies also revealed the same functional domains [1]. Role of residues at the N-groove Docking data indicated that the frequency of dinucleotides docking to the LqhIT2 N-groove was higher than that of any of the other three regions. Some of these residues show positive charges on the surface, providing a favorable binding surface for negatively charged dinucleotides. During the interactions with dinucleotides, residues Lys11, Ala10, Ala41, Gly39, Asn58, Val12, Ser55, and Arg6 frequently form hydrogen bonds with dinucleotides, which suggest that they are functional sites (Fig. 3). These 10 residues are mainly located in the N-groove region and Ser55 and Asn58 (C-terminal loops), in which the N-groove and C-terminal loops are interconnected by a forth disulfide bridge, generate a structural entity that protrudes from the core motif [1]. Analyzing the results of the 16 dinucleotides docking to LqhIT2 by VIDA2 (OpenEye Scientific Software, Inc.), the residue order of the docked dinucleotides frequency to the N-groove is Lys11 > Ala10 > Ala41 > Gly39 >> Val12 > Asp8 > Arg6 > Ala13 > Arg7 > Leu15 > Gly9 > Ala14 > Leu40 > Ile16 > Thr37 = Trp38 = Ala42. Research by Izhar Karbat et al. indicated that the binding affinity of the toxin decreased markedly upon substitution of residues that line the N-groove (D8A/R, L15A, I16A, and G17A), and residues that form its hydrophobic bed (K11A/R, V12R, and A13E/R). Substitution of Tyr3 and Trp53 that stabilize the unique conformation of Lys11 (Y3F and W53V) also reduced the binding affinity. Substitution of Ala13 suggested it has a unique role in toxin function. They

also suggested that the N-groove region is involved in the voltagesensor trapping process [25] and concluded that both the surface topology and the overall hydrophobic nature of the N-groove are crucial for the insecticidal potency of LqhIT2. The conclusion of the Karbat study confirmed our docking prediction that the Ngroove is the main functional region of LqhIT2. Role of residues associated with the a-helix and its vicinity The residues ordering the frequency of dinucleotides docking to the a-helix is Glu24 > Ala27 > y28 > Lys26 >> Glu19 > Asp22 > Gly20 > Lys23 > Ala21 > Gly17 > Asn18 > Ala25. This docking result showed that Glu24 plays an important role in the a-helix. In previous studies, Cohen et al have suggested that all scorpion b-toxins share a common pharmacophore that contains a ``hot spot" composed of a negatively charged Glu on the a-helix flanked by hydrophobic residues that may occlude bulk solvent from the point of interaction with a channel residue [20,26]. Izhar Karbat also showed that Glu24 and its flanking Ile16 and Tyr28 formed a hotspot in the bioactive surface of LqhIT2, as shown for other b-toxins. The unique spatial arrangement of Asn58 suggests a bioactive role The residue order of the frequency of dinucleotides docking to the C-groove is Asn58 > Ser55 > Tyr28 > Ala60 > Lys51 > Trp53 > Gly61 > Asp50 > Lys54 > Thr59 > Glu45 > Thr57 > Asp49 > Gly29 > Pro48 > Gly30 > Thr52. As Strugatsky previously reported, the activity of depressant toxins decreased markedly when Asn58 was substituted by Asp3. Trp53 and Cys60 are stabilizing elements in the toxin structure with a limited degree of freedom dictating a defined orientation of the side-chain of Asn58, which seals the cavity. When Asn58 is substituted by residues that are unable to interact with Trp53 and Cys60, the seal of the cavity is hampered, and the adverse effects on toxin function may be due to an increased accessibility of the C-terminal segment interior to water. The observation that the Nd2 atom of Asn58 coordinates a co-crystallized sulfate ion provides additional support for this hypothesis. The research by Izhar Karbat involving the activity of mutants K54A, E56A, T57A, and the triple mutant K54A-E56A-T57A tested on blowfly larvae and on rat brain channels (Nav1.2a) expressed in Xenopus oocytes also suggested that the C-groove is not directly involved in the insecticidal features of LqhIT2.

(A­D) are 90°-rotated state of LqhIT2 separately; (D­G) are 90°-rotated state of LqhIT2 with d(pApA) dinucleotides docked. As shown, more d(pApA) dinucleotides are mainly located in the N-groove pocket than the other domains (C-groove; a-helix and b-sheet).

Dinucleotides docking to ANEPIII and predicting the ANEPIII functional site From the 16 flexible dinucleotides docking simulation, we found that the low-energy conformational structures are mainly located in three regions: the N-groove, C-groove and between the a-helix and the b-sheet (Fig. 4). Docking data indicated that the frequency of dinucleotides docking to the ANEPIII N-groove was higher than that of any of the other three regions (Fig. 4). During the interactions with dinucleotides, residues Lys11, Ala41, Gly39, Ser13, Asn58, Tyr3, Leu15, Glu24, Asn8, and Trp16 frequently form hydrogen bonds with dinucleotides, which suggests they should be functional sites. These 10 residues are mainly lo-

cated in the N-groove region but Tyr3 (b-sheet1), Glu24 (ahelix) and Asn58(C-terminal loops), which indicate the functional region located in the N-groove, as in the study of LqhIT2, the sites Tyr3 (b-sheet1), Glu24 (a-helix) and Asn58(C-terminal loops) of ANEPIII should be active sites in the other different regions. Analyzing the results of the 16 dinucleotides docking to ANEPIII by VIDA, the residues order of the frequency of dinucleotides docking to the N-groove is Lys11 >> Ala41 > Gly39 > Ser31 >> Asn8 > Leu15 > Trp16 >> Ser7 > Cys10 > Gly9 > Ile12 > Glu45 = Cys14. . .. . .. We also found that Lys11, Ala41, Gly39 and Cys10 had a close relationship during dinucleotides docking. This indicates that the functional region is an important binding domain.

The residues ordering of the frequency of dinucleotides docking to the a-helix is Glu24 > Glu19 > Gly20 > Asn18 P Gly17 > Cys21. . .. . .. The docking results suggested that Glu24 is important in the a-helix, just like the results obtained by Cohen et al who showed that all scorpion b-toxins share a common pharmacophore that contains a ``hot spot" made of a negatively charged Glu on the a-helix flanked by hydrophobic residues that may occlude bulk solvent from the point of interaction with a channel residue [20,25]. The residue order of the docked dinucleotides frequency to the C-groove is Asn58 >> Cys60 > Ser55 > Gly62 > Trp53 > Glu56 > Thr52 = Gly61 > Lys51 = Thr59 = Leu47 = Asp49 > Asp50 = Pro48 = Gly46 > Ser57 = Lys54. As Strugatsky previously reported, the activity of depressant toxins decreased markedly when Asn58 was substituted by Asp3. Trp53 and Cys60 are stabilizing elements in the toxin structure with a limited degree of freedom dictating a defined orientation of the side-chain of Asn58, which seals the cavity. Conclusions Based on the principle of SELEX, docking of dinucleotides to protein was performed. The 16 flexible dinucleotides d(pApA), d(pApC), d(pApG),d(pApT), d(pCpA), d(pCpC), d(pCpG), d(pCpT), d(pGpA), d(pGpC), d(pGpG), d(pGpT), d(pTpA), d(pTpC), d(pTpG), and d(pTpT) were docked onto the surface of scorpion polypeptide toxins (PDB ID:2I61) and ANEPIII. By analyzing the phosphates of the docked dinucleotides, we developed a model indicating where the functional structure site is located. The docking results suggested that dinucleotides docking is a molecular modeling method that could be developed for protein functional site recognition.
