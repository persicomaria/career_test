ABSTRACT: RIMs are large proteins that contain two C2-domains and are localized at presynaptic active zones, where neurotransmitters are released. RIMs play key roles in synaptic vesicle priming and regulation of presynaptic plasticity. A mutation in the RIM1 C2A-domain has been implicated in autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CORD7). The RIM C2A-domain does not contain the full complement of aspartate residues that commonly mediate Ca2+ binding at the top loops of C2-domains, and has been reported to interact with SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin 1, two proteins from the Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion machinery. Here we have used NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography to analyze the structure and biochemical properties of the RIM2 C2A-domain, which is closely related to the RIM1 C2A-domain. We find that the RIM2 C2A-domain does not bind Ca2+. Moreover, little binding of the RIM2 C2A-domain to SNAP-25 and to the C2-domains of synaptotagmin 1 was detected by NMR experiments, suggesting that as yet unidentified interactions of the RIM C2A-domain mediate its function. The crystal structure of the RIM2 C2A-domain using data to 1.4 Å resolution reveals a -sandwich that resembles those observed for other C2-domains, but exhibits a unique dipolar distribution of electrostatic charges whereby one edge of the -sandwich is highly positive and the other edge is highly negative. The location of the mutation site implicated in CORD7 at the bottom of the domain and the pattern of sequence conservation suggest that, in contrast to most C2-domains, the RIM C2A-domains may function through Ca2+-independent interactions involving their bottom face.

The release of neurotransmitters by Ca2+-triggered synaptic vesicle exocytosis is a central event in interneuronal communication. This process is highly regulated and involves several steps, which include docking of the synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic plasma membrane, one or more priming reactions that leave the vesicles in a release-ready state, and the actual Ca2+-evoked release of neurotransmitters when an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal (1). Release is restricted to specialized sites of the presynaptic plasma membrane known as active zones. The different steps that lead to exocytosis are controlled by a complex protein machinery. This machinery is formed in part by components that have homologues in all types of intracellular membrane traffic such as the SNARE proteins synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25,1 which play a key role in membrane fusion, and Rab3s, which are small GTPases that regulate neuThis work was supported by NIH Grant NS40944 to J.R.

rotransmitter release (reviewed in refs 2 and 3). In addition, neurotransmitter release is controlled by specialized proteins such as the Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin 1 (reviewed in refs 4 and 5) and the components of the active zone, among others. Active zones integrate presynaptic signals that regulate neurotransmitter release and are formed by a network of large proteins, which include RIMs, Munc13s, Bassoon, piccolo, ELKS, and liprins (reviewed in ref 6). Among these proteins, RIMs are particularly interesting because of the multiple roles in regulating release and organizing the active zone that have been suggested by genetic and biochemical experiments. RIMs were initially identified as Rab3 effectors (7) and include four genes in mammals (RIM1, RIM2, RIM3, and RIM4) (8) and one in Caenorhabditis elegans (unc10) (9). The mammalian RIM1 and RIM2 genes specify full-length transcripts encoding two closely related protein products (RIM1R and RIM2R, respectively) that contain an N-terminal zinc finger domain, a PDZ domain, and two C-terminal C2domains (called C2A-domain and C2B-domain). In addition, the RIM2 gene specifies a shorter transcript lacking the N-terminal zinc finger (RIM2 ) and an even shorter transcript (RIM2) that, like RIM3 and RIM4, only encodes the C2Bdomain and adjacent sequences (8). Unc10 mutants in C. elegans exhibit a drastic decrease in the level of release that is associated with a defect in synaptic vesicle priming (9). Deletion of RIM1R in mice leads to a milder phenotype, probably because of redundancy with RIM2R, but still results in less vesicle priming and alteration of short-term synaptic

RIM1R knockout mice exhibit severe defects in memory and learning (13) that most likely arise from these defects in neurotransmitter release and its regulation. The different domains of R-RIMs have been implicated in multiple protein-protein interactions. Thus, the N-terminal zinc finger domain and adjacent regions are involved in binding to Rab3s (7) and to Munc13-1 (14), an active zone protein with a key role in synaptic vesicle priming, while the PDZ domain binds to ELKS (also known as ERC or CAST) (15). On the other hand, the RIM C2A-domain was reported to bind to synaptotagmin 1 and to SNAP-25 (16), whereas the C2B-domain was also found to bind to synaptotagmin 1 and in addition to liprins (10). Finally, a prolinerich sequence between the two C2-domains binds to RIMbinding proteins (RIM-BPs) (17). These observations suggest that R-RIMs may act as scaffolds that help to organize the active zone through its multiple interactions with active zone proteins, and at the same time may regulate neurotransmitter release by binding to key components of the release apparatus. However, some of the biochemical studies that described these interactions relied largely on GST pull-down experiments, which are prone to artifacts (18); for instance, no binding of synaptotagmin 1 to the RIM2 C2A-domain was observed in GST pull-down experiments performed in a separate study (10). Moreover, little is know about the three-dimensional structures of the R-RIM domains. Due in part to this scarcity of structural and definitive biochemical information, there is currently a large gap between the extensive genetic and physiological data describing the functions of R-RIMs and the limited molecular understanding of these functions. In this study, we have focused on the structure and interactions of the RIM C2A-domain. This domain plays a critical role in the proper localization of unc10 in C. elegans (19), and its functional importance was emphasized by the observation that an R844H point mutation in the RIM1R C2A-domain segregates with autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CORD7) (20). However, the RIM C2A-domain is only distantly related to the C2-domains that have been more thoroughly studied, and it is unclear to what extent it shares their properties. C2-domains are widespread protein modules that usually bind phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner and have a -sandwich structure with loops emerging at the top and bottom of the sandwich (reviewed in ref 21). Multiple Ca2+ ions commonly bind to a motif formed by five conserved aspartate residues located at the top loops (22-25), which also mediate phospholipid binding (26, 27). However, some C2-domains do not bind Ca2+ or phospholipids. The RIM C2A-domain does not contain the full complement of aspartate residues that form the C2-domain Ca2+-binding motif. This observation suggests that the RIM C2A-domain does not bind Ca2+, but this prediction has not been tested. Moreover, because of the limited degree of sequence identity with C2-domains of known three-dimensional structure, it is unknown whether the RIM C2A-domain contains specific structural features that may be critical for its function. To shed light on these questions and provide a structural basis for understanding the role(s) of the C2A-domain from

Dai et al. RIMs, we have analyzed the biochemical properties of the RIM2 C2A-domain using NMR spectroscopy, and we have determined its crystal structure using data to 1.4 Å resolution. We find that the RIM2 C2A-domain does not bind to Ca2+, phospholipids, synaptotagmin 1, or SNAP-25 with significant affinity, suggesting that other interactions mediate its function. The RIM2 C2A-domain adopts a -sandwich structure that resembles those of other C2-domains such as the C2Adomain of synaptotagmin 1, but exhibits a striking dipolar distribution of electrostatic potential, with a highly positive potential on one edge of the -sandwich and a highly negative potential at the opposite edge. The location of the conserved arginine side chain implicated in CORD7 at the bottom of the domain and the pattern of sequence conservation in RIM C2A-domains suggest that these domains may function through Ca2+-independent interactions mediated by its bottom face, in contrast to the common involvement of Ca2+-dependent interactions of the top loops in C2-domain function. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Sample Preparation. DNA encoding GST fusion proteins of various fragments spanning the rat RIM2 C2A-domain were made using custom-designed primers and standard PCR cloning techniques and subcloned into the pGEX-KG expression vector. The R805H RIM2 C2A-domain point mutant (residues 722-859) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The fusion proteins were expressed at 25 °C in Escherichia coli BL21 and isolated by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose followed by on-resin cleavage with thrombin. The eluted proteins were further purified by gelfiltration chromatography on a S75 column (Amersham). Uniform 15N labeling was achieved by growing the bacteria in 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. NMR Spectroscopy. All NMR experiments were carried out at 27 °C on Varian INOVA500 or INOVA600 spectrometers with samples containing approximately 100 µM C2-domains dissolved in 20 mM MES (pH 6.0) and 150 mM NaCl. Ca2+ titrations monitored by 1H-15N HSQC experiments were performed as described previously (25). All the NMR binding experiments were carried out at 27 °C on Varian INOVA500 or INOVA600 spectrometers with samples containing 60 µM 15N-labeled proteins and 80 µM nonlabeled proteins dissolved in 20 mM MES (pH 6.0) and 150 mM NaCl in the presence or absence of 10 mM CaCl2. All NMR data were processed with NMRPipe (28) and analyzed with NMRView (29). X-ray Crystallography. Rat RIM2 C2A-domain (residues 722-859) dissolved in 20 mM MES (pH 6.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA was concentrated to 25 mg/mL and crystallized in 17.5% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5) at 20 °C using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Crystals appeared overnight and grew to a final size of 0.05 mm × 0.05 mm × 0.1 mm within 2 days. Prior to data collection, crystals were transferred into a solution of 20% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5), and 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and then flash-cooled in liquid propane.

Photon Source at 100 K to a Bragg spacing (dmin) of 1.41 Å. The crystals exhibited the symmetry of space group P21, contained one molecule per asymmetric unit, and had the following unit cell parameters: a ) 25.45 Å, b ) 44.81 Å, c ) 55.76 Å, and ) 103.86°. Data were processed and scaled in the HKL2000 program suite (30). The rat RIM2 C2A-domain structure was determined via molecular replacement using AMoRe (31). Initial model coordinates were obtained by modifying the coordinates of the human RIM2 C2A-domain (PDB entry 1v27). The rotation and translation function search was conducted with data between a dmin of 8.0 and 4.0 Å, and a single solution was obtained with a final correlation coefficient of 0.50. Model refinement was carried out with Refmac (32) of the CCP4 package (33) with a random subset of all data set aside for the calculation of Rfree. Manual adjustments to the models were carried out with O (34). The electron density clearly showed the presence of two sulfate ions. After refinement of the protein part was complete, solvent molecules were added where stereochemically reasonable. The model has good stereochemistry, with 87.7% of residues in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot and none in disallowed regions. Data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. RESULTS Definition of Domain Boundaries and Biochemical Analysis. The region of RIM2 that contains the predicted C2Adomain exhibits only a limited degree of sequence similarity with C2-domains of known structure, particularly at the C-terminus where C2-domains tend to be more variable. For instance, the synaptotagmin 1 C2B-domain contains two C-terminal R-helices that are not present in the synaptotagmin 1 C2A-domain and, as a result, is 20 residues longer (18, 22). To experimentally define the correct boundaries of the RIM2 C2A-domain, we expressed several constructs spanning residues 662-869 of RIM2, performed limited proteolysis experiments with trypsin and chymotrypsin, and identified proteolytically resistant fragments by mass spectrometry (data

not shown). On the basis of these experiments, we focused on a minimal fragment containing residues 722-859 of RIM2. A 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of a uniformly 15N-labeled sample of this fragment in the absence of Ca2+ (Figure 1, black contours) revealed an excellent chemical shift dispersion, demonstrating that the fragment is properly folded and thus contains the RIM2 C2A-domain. All experiments described below were performed with this fragment, which hereafter we will call the RIM2 C2A-domain for simplicity. In addition to providing information about the proper folding of a protein, 1H-15N HSQC spectra are also useful in analyzing interactions of a 15N-labeled protein in solution. 1 H-15N HSQC spectra contain one cross-peak for the amide group of each non-proline residue in the protein. The positions of the cross-peaks are very sensitive to the chemical environment of the amide groups. Hence, perturbations in these cross-peaks (shifts or broadening) report on interactions with ligands or other proteins. To analyze whether the RIM2 C2A-domain binds Ca2+, we acquired additional 1H-15N HSQC spectra in the presence of 1 and 20 mM Ca2+ (Figure 1, red and green contours, respectively). Addition of 1 mM Ca2+ did not induce significant perturbations, showing that the RIM2 C2A-domain does not bind Ca2+ at this concentration. A few cross-peaks exhibited small shifts in the presence of 20 mM Ca2+. This behavior is characteristic of C2-domains that do not bind Ca2+ with significant affinity and can be attributed to weak binding of Ca2+ to oxygen-rich clusters at the surface of a protein (35, 36). We also investigated whether the RIM2 C2A-domain binds negatively charged phospholipids using a fluorescence resonance energy transferbased assay (18), but we did not observe any significant binding in the absence or presence of Ca2+ (data not shown). The interactions of the RIM C2A-domain with SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin 1 were identified using pull-down experiments with GST fusion proteins immobilized on GST affinity resins (16). However, GST pull-down experiments are prone to artifacts that can yield false positive or negative results. For instance, we previously described that immobilized GST

fusions of the synaptotagmin 1 C2B-domain have a strong tendency to bind to polyacidic compounds that are very difficult to remove even with extensive washes of the resins

and that can induce artifactual binding or mask relevant interactions (37). To test whether the RIM2 C2A-domain binds to SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin 1 by an independent

Structure of the RIM2 C2A-Domain method, we used NMR spectroscopy. Addition of unlabeled SNAP-25 did not cause significant perturbation of the 1H15 N HSQC spectrum of the 15N-labeled RIM2 C2A-domain in the absence of Ca2+ (Figure 2A), showing that the RIM2 C2A-domain and SNAP-25 do not interact under these conditions. Only minor spectral changes were observed in analogous experiments performed in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+ (Figure 2B). These minor changes may reflect a very low affinity interaction that is likely to be nonspecific and that contrasts with the nanomolar affinity observed in GST pull-down experiments (16). To test for interactions between the RIM2 C2A-domain and synaptotagmin 1, we prepared 15N-labeled samples of the synaptotagmin 1 C A-domain and 2 C2B-domain and recorded the effects that addition of the unlabeled RIM2 C2A-domain has on their 1H-15N HSQC spectra in the absence and presence of 10 mM Ca2+ (Figure 2C-F). The RIM2 C2A-domain did not cause any significant perturbations in these spectra, showing that it does not bind to the synaptotagmin 1 C2-domains. It should be noted that these experiments were performed in solution with purified fragments that do not contain any tags (such as GST) and that have been extensively characterized by NMR spectroscopy. In addition, these experiments were performed at protein concentrations of 60-80 µM that favor the formation of protein complexes even if they have low affinity. Hence, we conclude that the RIM2 C2A-domain does not form binary complexes with SNAP-25 and the synaptotagmin 1 C2domains either in the presence or absence of Ca2+ with significant affinity. Three-Dimensional Structure of the RIM2 C2A-Domain at 1.4 Å Resolution. To investigate whether the RIM2 C2Adomain has specific structural features, we turned to X-ray crystallography. Crystals of the RIM2 C2A-domain grew overnight in 17.5% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5) at 20 °C. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using as a search model an NMR structure of the human RIM2 C2A-domain that was deposited in the PDB (entry 1v27) as part of a structural genomics initiative, but has not been described in the literature. The crystal structure was refined using data to 1.4 Å resolution. A ribbon diagram of the RIM2 C2Adomain is shown in Figure 3, and the structural statistics are summarized in Table 1. A portion of the electron density is shown in Figure 4A. Like other C2-domains, the structure of the RIM2 C2A-domain consists of a -sandwich formed by two four-stranded -sheets. The bottom of the domain contains a short 310-helix in the loop connecting strands 5 and 6, which often contains a short R-helix in other C2-domains, too. No electron density was observed for the loop connecting strands 6 and 7, which is usually called loop 3 and is commonly involved in binding of Ca2+ to C2domains (21). This loop is ordered in most C2-domains whose structures have been elucidated, but it is highly charged and somewhat longer in the RIM2 C2A-domain, which likely results in its greater flexibility. Two prominent, tetrahedrally shaped electron density peaks that can be attributed to sulfate ions are observed near the bottom loop of the RIM2 C2A-domain that contains the 310-helix (Figure 4A). One sulfate ion interacts with the backbone amide nitrogens of R805 and R806, two nitrogens from the guanidine group of the R806 side chain, and two water molecules. The other sulfate ion is also bound to the

guanidine side chain group of R806 and is coordinated by an additional water molecule. Figure 4B shows a ribbonand-stick diagram illustrating the relative orientations of the side chains in this region, which includes the R805 side chain. This side chain is in a position equivalent to R844 of the human RIM1R C2A-domain, which has been identified as a mutation site (to His) in CORD7 patients (20). The exposed nature of this side chain suggests that the Arg to His mutation does not affect folding of the domain, which we confirmed with the observation that the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the 15N-labeled R805H mutant RIM2 C2Adomain is similar to that of the wild-type RIM2 C2A-domain and exhibits only minor perturbations (data not shown). Thus, it is most likely that the mutation causes disease by interfering with an interaction(s) of the RIM C2A-domain with a target molecule. The observation of the two bound sulfate ions in the crystal structure of the RIM2 C2A-domain, which might mimic the negative charges of a target, also suggests that this region may act as an interaction site through its multiple positively charged residues. The potential importance of electrostatic forces for the interactions of the RIM C2A-domain was further emphasized by examination of its surface electrostatic potential. Intriguingly, this analysis revealed a striking dipolar distribution, with a highly positively charged surface on the edge of the -sandwich that includes the 310-helix region at the bottom, and a highly negatively charged surface on the opposite edge

Two views of the electrostatic surface potential of the rat RIM2 C2A-domain rotated 180° with respect to the vertical axis are shown. In the left panel, strands 7 and 8 are in the front, while in the right panel, strands 4 and 5 are in the front. Hydrogen atoms were generated using CNS (48), and the electrostatic surface potential was computed with GRASP (49) and rendered with PyMol. The electrostatic potential is contoured at the 5 kT/e level, with red denoting negative potential and blue denoting positive potential.

(Figure 5). The positively charged edge is formed by strands 4 and 5, and its highly positive potential is due in part to the abundance of basic residues in strand 4. The opposite edge of the -sandwich is formed by strands 7 and 8, both of which contain negatively charged residues. Overall, the basic and acidic residues that lead to the dipolar character of the RIM C2A-domain are generally conserved in RIM C2Adomains (Figure 6). Correspondingly, analysis of the surface electrostatic potential in models of the RIM C2A-domains from different species, built by homology with the structure of the rat RIM C2A-domain, also revealed a dipolar charge distribution, although this dipolar character is less pronounced

in the unc10 C2A-domain because of a lower degree of conservation of the charged residues (data not shown). Comparison of the RIM C2A-Domains with Other C2Domains. C2-domains usually form -sandwiches that can have two different topologies resulting from a circular permutation of the -strands (called topology I and II) (21, 38). The structure of the RIM C2A-domain conforms to topology I, which is also observed in other C2-domains involved in intracellular membrane traffic such as those from synaptotagmins (18, 22, 35, 39, 40) and rabphilin (41), as well as in some C2-domains involved in signal transduction such as those of PKCs (42, 43). A structural comparison performed with DALI (44) revealed that, as expected, the RIM2 C2A-domain is closely structurally similar to other C2-domains. The highest Z score yielded by DALI in the search (18.2) corresponds to the crystal structure of the synaptotagmin 1 C2A-domain (22), which exhibits a trace rms deviation of 1.7 Å for 119 equivalent CR atoms with respect to the RIM2 C2A-domain. A trace superposition of the synaptotagmin 1 and RIM2 C2A-domains (Figure 7A) shows that there is a remarkable similarity between the two structures in the -sheets, and that differences occur largely at a few loops connecting the -strands, particularly at the C-terminal loop connecting strands 7 and 8. Indeed, ribbon superpositions of the known C2-domain structures revealed that the conformation of this loop is highly variable in C2domains, as illustrated with the RIM2 C2A-domain, the synaptotagmin 1 C2A-domain and C2B-domain, and the PKC- C2-domain in Figure 7B. Note that some degree of diversity is observed in the structure of most loops, and in some cases, they can diverge considerably [e.g., the cPLA2 C2-domain contains an R-helix inserted in loop 1 (45)]. However, the high variability of the loop connecting strands 7 and 8 in basically all C2-domains is particularly pronounced. The alignment shown in Figure 6 compares the sequences of the RIM C2A-domains from different species together with those of the rat RIM C2B-domain and of other rat C2-domains

with type I topology. The alignment illustrates that the C-terminal sequences of C2-domains are in general more variable than the remaining sequences, particularly in the region connecting strands 7 and 8. This observation correlates with the structural diversity in this region. However, it is noteworthy that this region exhibits a relatively high degree of conservation in RIMs, and is included among several regions that are conserved in RIMs but differ in other C2domains (highlighted in blue in Figure 6; note that these regions may still be conserved in different species for a given C2-domain). Interestingly, the strand 7-strand 8 region contains several acidic residues that are selectively conserved in RIM C2A-domains and that contribute to their dipolar character. Strand 4 and adjacent sequences, which also contribute substantially to this dipolar character, contain

several basic residues that are selectively conserved in RIM C2A-domains. However, this region is basic in most C2domains, particularly in the synaptotagmin 1 C2B-domain (18), and thus includes basic residues that are conserved throughout the C2-domain family (highlighted in red in Figure 6). Overall, these observations suggest that the striking dipolar nature is a unique property of the RIM C2A-domains. A survey of the surface electrostatic potential of several C2domains revealed that some degree of charge separation is actually observed in several of them, although it is generally not as marked as in the RIM2 C2A-domain (Figure 1 of the Supporting Information). It is also worth noting that loop 3 at the top of the domain, which usually contains three of the aspartate side chains that coordinate Ca2+ in Ca2+-dependent C2-domains (23) and is

directly involved in phospholipid binding (26, 27), exhibits a relatively low level of sequence conservation in RIM C2Adomains. This contrasts with the high level of conservation of residues in the strand 3-strand 4 and strand 7-strand 8 regions at the bottom half of the domain, which also contains the R805 residue that is mutated in RIM1R of CORD7 patients. These observations suggest that the bottom part of the RIM C2A-domains may play a key role in their function, in contrast to the preponderant role that the top half plays in Ca2+-dependent C2-domains. The differences between the RIM C2A-domains and the C2-domains from synaptotagmins, rabphilin, and PKCs are emphasized in the dendogram shown in Figure 8, which was constructed on the basis of the sequence alignment of Figure 6. The dendogram shows that the synaptotagmin, rabphilin, and PKC C2-domains are more closely related to each other than to the RIM C2A-domains. This finding does not correlate

strictly with the inability of the RIM C2A-domains to bind Ca2+, since the synaptotagmin 4 C2A-domain is also unable to bind Ca2+ (35). In addition, the piccolo C2A-domain binds Ca2+ (46) but is more closely related to the RIM C2Adomains than to the synaptotagmin, rabphilin, and PKC C2domains (Figure 8). The rat RIM C2B-domain, which is also predicted to be unable to bind Ca2+, appears to be equally distant from the RIM C2A-domains and the synaptotagmin, rabphilin, and PKC C2-domains. DISCUSSION RIMs are large, multidomain proteins of the presynaptic active zone that play key roles in synaptic vesicle priming and regulation of short- and long-term presynaptic plasticity (9-12). These multiple roles are most likely associated with interactions of RIMs with target molecules. Indeed, multiple interactions of the RIM domains with active zone proteins

Structure of the RIM2 C2A-Domain and with proteins implicated in Ca2+-dependent membrane fusion have been described (7, 10, 14-17), suggesting that RIMs help to organize the active zone and regulate neurotransmitter release by directly influencing the membrane fusion apparatus. However, there is little information about the nature and the relevance of these interactions, as well as about the three-dimensional structures of the RIM domains. This scarcity of structural and biochemical information hinders the development of a molecular understanding of the functions of RIMs, which on the other hand have been extensively characterized by genetic and physiological experiments. To help develop such an understanding, in this work we have focused on the structure and interactions of the RIM2 C2A-domain. We find that this domain does not bind Ca2+, as predicted on the basis of the observation that the RIM2 C2A-domain does not contain the full complement of aspartate residues that form the canonical C2-domain Ca2+binding motif (see Figure 6). In addition, our data reveal no significant binding of the RIM2 C2A-domain to SNAP-25 and to the synaptotagmin 1 C2-domains either in the presence or in the absence of Ca2+. Binding of the RIM C2A-domain to SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin 1 had been previously investigated using pull-down assays with immobilized GST fusion proteins (16). These experiments were motivated by the observation that the RIM C2A-domain contains multiple basic residues in strand 4, which are also present in the synaptotagmin 1 C2B-domain and were implicated in its oligomerization as well as in interactions with other targets. However, this polybasic region of the synaptotagmin 1 C2Bdomain was shown to bind avidly to polyacidic compounds such as DNA and RNA, which are very difficult to remove from immobilized GST fusion proteins and could induce artifactual interactions (37). For instance, the purified synaptotagmin 1 C2B-domain was shown to be monomeric in solution (37). Thus, it seems likely that interactions of the RIM C2A-domain with synaptotagmin 1 and SNAP-25 observed with GST pull-down experiments (16), which we could not confirm with our NMR experiments, may arise from incomplete removal of acidic contaminants in the immobilized proteins. Indeed, mutations in the polybasic region of the RIM C2A-domain abolished binding to synaptotagmin 1 (16), consistent with this proposal. Our NMR data cannot rule out the possibility that the RIM C2A-domain interacts with synaptotagmin 1 sequences outside its C2domains, but it should be noted that no interaction between the RIM C2A-domain and synaptotagmin 1 from brain extracts was observed in separate GST pull-down experiments (10). On the basis of the crucial importance of the RIM C2A-domain for proper localization (19), it is tempting to speculate that an as yet unidentified interaction with another active zone protein may underlie the primary function of the RIM C2A-domain. The crystal structure of the RIM2 C2A-domain and the comparison with other C2-domains described here further emphasize the pattern of conservation and divergence that has been emerging from structural studies of these intriguing protein modules. On one hand, the similarity between the structures of the RIM2 C2A-domain and the synaptotagmin 1 C2A-domain (Figure 7A) shows the high degree of structural conservation of the core of the -sandwich. On the other hand, this and other structural comparisons between

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 41, 2005 13541 C2-domains (e.g., Figure 7B) illustrate the variability in the loops connecting the strands of the -sandwich, which thus appears to act as a scaffold for diverse sequences emerging at the top and the bottom. Particularly striking is the diversity of the loop connecting strands 7 and 8 at the bottom of the domain. While the significance of this diversity remains to be established, the functional importance of the bottom of the RIM C2A-domain is supported by the selective conservation of several residues in the strand 7-strand 8 region of the RIM C2A-domain, and by the implication of the RIM1R R844H mutation in CORD7. A key functional role for the bottom of the RIM C2A-domains would represent a new paradigm for the range of mechanisms of action of C2domains, which until now have been largely shown to function through the Ca2+-dependent interactions mediated by their top loops. A distinct mechanism of action for the RIM C2A-domains would not be surprising given the observation that the C2-domains of synaptotagmins, rabphilins, and PKCs are more closely related to each other than to the RIM C2A-domains (Figure 8). The finding that the RIM2 C2A-domain exhibits an unusual dipolar distribution of electrostatic charges that is conserved in most RIM C2Adomains suggests that this dipolar character may be critical for its role in neurotransmitter release. In particular, the presence of a highly positively charged surface that includes the arginine mutated in CORD7 patients suggests that an interaction of the RIM C2A-domain with a highly acidic target may be crucial for its function. Further research will be needed to test these ideas and identify which interaction(s) mediates the function of the RIM C2A-domain. The crystal structure of the RIM2 C2A-domain described here provides a framework for understanding the basis of this function.
