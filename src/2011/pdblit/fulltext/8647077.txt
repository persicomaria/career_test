The structure of the complex of Aeromonas proteolytica aminopeptidase, a two-zinc exopeptidase, with the inhibitor p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxarnate has been determined by X-ray crystallography. Refinement of the structure, which includes 220 water molecules, using data at 0.80- 0.23-nm resolution resulted in a crystallographic residual R value of 16%. The hydroxamate group adopts a planar conformation whereby the two oxygen atoms interact with the zinc ions. The N-hydroxyl group of the inhibitor is located between the two zinc ions, a position which is close to that occupied by a water molecule in the native structure. The carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitor binds to Znl, which becomes pentacoordinated while Zn2 remains tetracoordinated, in contrast to the native protein where both zinc ions were shown to be tetracoordinated and structurally equivalent. Interactions of the carboxylate oxygens of Glu151 with the hydroxamate group play an important role in the stabilization of the complex. Keywords: exopeptidase ; inhibitor; X-ray structure; zinc enzyme.

Aminopeptidases belong to a family of zinc-dependent enzymes that have one or two zinc ions per active site and are implicated in the metabolism of biologically active peptides. Aerornonas proteolytica aminopeptidase (AAP) is a member of the subclass of two-zinc exopeptidases that cleave the N-terminal residue from polypeptide substrates. The recently reported crystal structure of this enzyme has suggested the existence of a co-catalytic zinc unit (Chevrier et al., 1994), which is similar to the bovine lens leucine aminopeptidase (BLAP), a two-zinc aminopeptidase that was well characterized by crystallographic studies some years ago (Burley et al., 1990, 1992). Structural analyses of the complexes with the natural inhibitors bestatin (Burley et al., 1991, 1992; Kim et al., 1993) and amastatin (Kim and Lipscomb, 1993) have led to the formulation of a hydrolytic mechanism for BLAP (Kim and Lipscomb, 1994). AAP and BLAP exhibit similar kinetics (Bayliss and Prescott, 1986) and their C-terminal catalytic domains have homologous folds. Nevertheless, these two aminopeptidases show notable differences in the nature and arrangement of the ligands in the zinc coordination sphere, which suggest differences in their catalytic mechanisms. An essential water molecule that is coordinated to both zinc ions in AAP (Chevrier et al., 1994) was not observed in the

vicinity of the zinc ions in BLAP. Earlier kinetic studies showed that full activity of AAP could be restored by I mol zinclmol apoenzyme, which suggests that only one zinc ion is essential for catalysis (Prescott et al., 1983). Structural studies of enzyme-inhibitor complexes provide a good approach for the elucidation of the catalytic mechanism. Bestatin and amastatin were used for their capacity to mimic the hydrated scissile peptide bond of the substrate by their tetrahedral hydroxyl group. Hydroxamic acids are metal chelators widely used for metallopeptidase inhibition. N-Peptidyl-hydroxamates have been designed as inhibitors of biological metalloproteases such as angiotensin-converting enzyme, endopeptidase, collagenase, and arninopeptidases (Powers and Harper, 1986). A characteristic feature of hydroxamates is their ability to form bidentate complexes with transition metal ions via their carbonyl and hydroxyl oxygens (Parekh et al., 1989). Phenylalanine-hydroxamate inhibits AAP with a K, of 8.8 pM for the Lenantiomer and 0.8 pM for the racemic mixture, which indicates a better affinity for the D-isomer (Wilkes and Prescott, 1983). Its high affinity for AAP made it an attractive active site marker, and we therefore synthesized p-iodo-D-phenylalanine-hydroxamate for use as a heavy atom derivative. The p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate inhibitory constant, K, = 0.4 pM, is similar to that of phenylalanine-hydroxamate, which shows that the iodine atom does not affect its inhibitory properties. In this paper, we report the refined X-ray structure of AAP complexed with p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate at 0.23nm resolution. Since AAP contains two zinc ions in its active site, the AAP-p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate complex is clearly differentiated from the known one-zinc metalloproteasehydroxamate complexes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Synthesis of p-iodo-D-phenylalaninehydroxamate acid. 2(R)-Boc-amino-3-(4-iodophenylipP-opionic acid. The following were added to a suspension of 4-iodo-~-phenylalanine (Aldrich, 953 mg, 3.27 mmol) in methanol (15 ml): di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (786 mg, 3.60 mmol) and, dropwise, triethylamine (397 mg, 3.92 mmol) in methanol (5 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and the resulting clear solution was evaporated under vacuum. The residue was partitioned between water and chloroform. The aqueous layer was acidified with hydrochloric acid to pH 2, extracted with ethyl acetate, and dried over magnesium sulfate to give, after evaporation, 2-(R)-Boc-amino3-(4-iodophenyl)propionic acid as a white solid (1.076 g, 84% yield), melting point 142°C. 2-(R)-Boc-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(4-iodophenyl)propionamide.

RESULTS
The final refined structure consists of 291 amino acid residues, 2 zinc ions, 14 non-hydrogen atoms of p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate and 220 water molecules. The rms deviations from ideal bond lengths and ideal bond angles are 0.002nm and 3.2", respectively. The upper limit of error in atomic positions is between 0.015 nm and 0.020 nm according to the Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952). The final model of the inhibitor molecule is shown in Fig. 1. Inhibitor binding does not induce major conformational changes in the protein, since the structure of AAP alone and the structure

of the enzyme complexed with p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate can be superposed with a rms difference of 0.062 nm for all the 291 structurally equivalent Ca atoms. The relevant differences between the two structures occur in the active site, (Fig. 2). The p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate molecule is positioned in the active site pocket such that its hydroxyl group bridges the two zinc ions, replacing the water molecule present in the native protein. The phenyl ring of the hydroxamate is stacked on the ring of Phe244 while the ring of Phe248 is displaced to accommodate the inhibitor. p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate binding is further stabilized by a hydrogen bond between its amino group and the phenolic oxygen of Tyr225 (piodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate NH2 -Tyr225 OH : 0.30 nm). The hydroxamate moiety forms a bidentate contact with Znl ; as a result, Znl becomes pentacoordinated while Zn2

remains tetracoordinated. Table 1 summarizes the zinc-ligand distances in the native AAP and in the complex. The inter-zinc distance in the complex (0.37 nm) is slightly longer than that found in the native enzyme (0.35 nm). Such an increase has been previously reported in two inhibitor complexes of BLAP, the bestatin complex (Burley et al., 1992; Kim et al., 1993) and the amastatin complex (Kim and Lipscomb, 1993). It is interesting to note that the bridging hydroxyl group of the inhibitor is more strongly bound to Zn2 than to Znl. The side chain carboxylate oxygens of Glu151 form the key interaction with the hydroxamate group of p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate (Glul5 1 Ocl -p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate OH : 0.31 nm ; Glul51 0&2-p-iodo-~-phenylalanine hydroxamate NH : 0.33 nm) (Table 2).

These interactions are shown with dashed lines in Fig. 2.

DISCUSSION
Structural information on the binding mode of hydroxamates to metallopeptidases has been available only for one-zinc endopeptidases such as thermolysin and collagenases. In hydroxamate complexes of thermolysin (Holmes and Matthews, 1981), human fibroblast collagenase (Borkakoti et al., 1994; Spurlino et al., 1994) and human neutrophil collagenase (Bode et al., 1994; Stams et al., 1994), the catalytic zinc ion is pentacoordinated by three protein ligands and by the hydroxyl and carbonyl oxygen atoms of the hydroxamates, which act unambiguously as bidentate ligands. Our data show similarities with hydroxamate one-zinc endopeptidase complexes. The bidentate interaction of the hydroxamate to zinc ion in the latter is analogous to the interaction of Znl with the two hydroxamate oxygens at 0.21 nm and 0.24 nm distance in the AAP-p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate complex (Fig. 2 and Table 1). A specific feature of this complex is the hydroxyl oxygen of the hydroxamate bridging the two zinc ions localized roughly at the position of the catalytic water of the native enzyme. This oxygen is in close contact with Zn2 at a distance of 0.18 nm. However, in contrast to native AAP, this complex clearly differentiates the environment of the two zinc ions; Zn2 is tetracoordinated by one oxygen ligand from the hydroxamate and three ligands from the protein (namely His97, Asp179, and Aspll7) while Znl is

pentacoordinated by two oxygen ligands from the hydroxamate and three ligands from the protein (namely His256, Glul52, and Aspl 17). Because of its pentacoordination, Znl would be analogous to the catalytic zinc of thermolysin, which suggests a preponderant role for Znl in the AAP catalysis. The inhibitor complex is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the amino group of the p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate and the phenolic oxygen of Tyr225 (Table 2). The a-amino group does not interact with the zinc ions, which indicates a better affinity of the hydroxylamino group for the zinc ions. This is in good agreement with kinetic measurements, which showed that the presence of the rx-amino group in hydroxamate inhibitors is not an absolute requirement for good affinity (Wilkes and Prescott, 1983). Upon binding of p-iodo-D-phenylalanine hydroxamate to AAP, the CONHOH group adopts a planar conformation with the two oxygen atoms pointing toward the Zn ions (Fig. 2), which could be consistent with the Z-conformation of the keto form R(C = 0)NHOH or the tautomeric enol form RC(0H)NOH (Fitzpatrick and Mageswaran, 1989) :

Since the stability of metal-hydroxamate complexes follows the order of basicity of the ligands (Parekh et al., 1989), the hydroxamate is expected to bind Zn more tightly than the hydroxamic acid. Hydroxamic acids are weak acids, with pK, values in the range 8-9 (Bagno et al., 1994), values which are expected to decrease upon interaction with Zn. Metal-bound water
