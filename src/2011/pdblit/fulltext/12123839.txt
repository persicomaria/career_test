Abstract Pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (PYNP) catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of pyrimidines in the nucleotide synthesis salvage pathway. We have built a model of a closed active conformation of the three-dimensional structure of PYNP from Bacillus subtilis. Using docking, molecular dynamics, and hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical methods to study the reaction mechanics between PYNP and a substrate, we identiWed the role of each residue in the active site during the entire catalytic process. The results indicate that the function of His82, Arg169, and Lys188 is to stabilize the uridine in a high-energy conformation by means of electrostatic interactions and that these residues are involved in catalysis. In addition, the function of Asp162 is likely to activate Lys188 for phosphorolytic catalysis through polarization eVects. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction In lower organisms (e.g. Bacillus subtilis), pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (PYNP)1 accepts both thymidine and uridine as substrate, whereas in mammalian and other higher organisms, it is speciWc for thymidine (designated thymidine phosphorylase, TP). PYNP from B. subtilis, composed of 434 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 46 kDa, is reported to catalyze the phosphorolysis of both uridine and thymidine (Protein Sequence Database ID S49457). PYNP has 40% sequence identity to human

TP, and serves as a good model for better understanding of the structure­function relationship of this intriguing enzyme/growth factor (Avraham et al., 1990; Blank and HoVee, 1975; Schwartz, 1971; Suzuki et al., 2001; Tsukayama et al., 2002). To date, detailed structural information on TP has come from the crystal structure analysis of Escherichia coli TP (Pugmire et al., 1998; Walter et al., 1990). Each subunit of the TP dimer consists of a large mixed helical and -sheet domain ( / domain) separated from a smaller -helical domain ( domain) with a large cleft. The active site consists of a pyrimidine-binding site in the domain and a phosphate-binding site across the cleft in the / domain. The distance between the phosphateand pyrimidine-binding sites previously reported (Walter et al., 1990) is too large (i.e., 8­9 Å) for catalysis to occur unless the and / domains move together. Similar domain movement has been reported in other enzymes (Gerstein and Chothia, 1991; Gerstein et al., 1993; Pugmire and Ealick, 1998). The domain movement proposed for TP

would close the active-site cleft and bring the substrates into mutual proximity. Evidence of the proposed rigidbody movement of the two domains has been reported for E. coli TP, in that its two domains have moved under the packing constraint of diVerent space groups (Pugmire et al., 1998). We have built models of uridine and the closed active conformation of the three-dimensional structure of PYNP from B. subtilis. Using docking, molecular dynamics, and quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) methods to explore reaction between PYNP and the substrate, we have identiWed the role of each residue in catalysis in the active site. Our calculations reveal that the role of His82, Arg169, and Lys188 is to stabilize uridine in a highenergy conformation with the aid of electrostatic interactions, and that these residues are involved in the catalytic function. Moreover, the function of Asp162 is likely to activate Lys188 for phosphorolytic catalysis by virtue of polarization eVects. PYNP shares 40% sequence identity with human TP, and thus serves as a good model for better understanding of the structure­function relationship of this intriguing enzyme/growth factor (Avraham et al., 1990; Blank and HoVee, 1975; Schwartz, 1971; Suzuki et al., 2001; Tsukayama et al., 2002). Potent inhibitors of TP and PYNP might have a signiWcant therapeutic value in various chemotherapeutic strategies. The PYNP­substrate complex should provide valuable insight into the rational design of such inhibitors. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Preparation of the enzyme­substrate system A model of the three-dimensional structure of PYNP from B. subtilis was prepared on a Silicon Graphics workstation with the Insight II software package. The Insight II Homology module was used for homology modeling (Homology User Guide, 1999). Homology operates by copying coordinates of the backbone atoms from the template molecule to the model and adding new side chains. Structurally conserved regions (SCRs) were assigned coordinates from the template molecule to the model, whereas other regions were also assigned coordinates as designated loops. The Loop Search function was used to Wnd suitable loops from protein structures in the PDB database that have the correct number of residues and distance to bridge, and in which the adjacent residues have appropriate conformations (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970). The crystal structure of PYNP from the thermophilic bacteria Bacillus stearothermophilus (PDB No. 1BRW) was used as the template (Pugmire and Ealick, 1998). In addition, the crystal structure of E. coli TP was compared and contrasted with the model. We chose the initial structure from a snapshot of a 1.0-ns molecular dynamics simulation of the model of PYNP from B. subtilis, and then this initial structure was optimized with a CHARMM22 force Weld (Brooks et al., 1983). Subsequently, the accuracy and validity of the model

were tested with the ProWles 3D (Luthy et al., 1992; ProWle3D User Guide, 1999) module of Insight II, which performs Eisenberg analysis. The structure of the substrate uridine was built according to early experimental and molecular modeling studies. The substrate was then optimized using quantum mechanics at the B3LYP level with the 6-31G¤ basis set (Hehre et al., 1986). The ligand atom charges were obtained from electrostatic potential Wtted charges from the B3LYP/631G¤ QM calculation (Besler et al., 1990). The PYNP­substrate complex was constructed by docking the ligand into the equilibrated PYNP structure using Autodock 3.0.4 (Morris et al., 1998). Then the system was equilibrated with a series of minimizations interspersed by short molecular dynamics simulations and the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm. The resulting structure was used as the starting model for the QM/MM study, as well as for a 1.2-ns molecular dynamics simulation, and the resulting structure from molecular dynamics simulation was then optimized by means of a CHARMM22 force Weld (Brooks et al., 1983). It contained a total of 6646 atoms. 2.2. Hybrid QM/MM calculations In the current study, we used the pseudobond ab initio QM/MM approach (Liu et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 1999, 2000, 2001), which circumvents the major deWciency of the conventional link-atom QM/MM approach by providing a consistent and well-deWned ab initio QM/MM potentialenergy surface. For the QM/MM calculations, the enzyme­ substrate system prepared was Wrst partitioned into a QM subsystem and an MM subsystem. The reaction system used a smaller QM subsystem consisting of the substrate uridine and phosphate ion, and side chains of His82, Asp162, Tyr166, Arg169, Ser184, and Lys188, with a total of 97 QM atoms. The boundary problem between the QM and MM subsystems was treated using the pseudobond approach (Zhang et al., 1999). With this PYNP­substrate QM/MM system, an iterative optimization procedure was applied to the QM/MM system, with B3LYP/3-21G¤ QM/MM calculations, leading to an optimized structure for the reactants. 2.3. Other computational details The calculations were performed with Gaussian 03 and GROMACS 3.21 programs (Berendsen et al., 1981; Frisch et al., 2003; Lindahl et al., 2001; van der Spoel et al., 2001). For the substrate, criteria used for geometry optimization followed Gaussian 03 defaults. For all the MM minimizations, the convergence criterion used was that the rootmean square (RMS) energy gradient was less than 0.0001. The twin-range cutoV method for non-bonded interactions was used in the MM minimization, with a long-range cutoV of 14 Å and a short-range cutoV of 8 Å. We performed a 1.2-ns molecular dynamics simulation for the PYNP­substrate system. The simulations were performed using the GROMACS (GROningen Machine for

Chemical Simulation) package (version 3.21) at constant temperature and pressure in a periodic cubic box, and the TIP3P model for water (Berendsen et al., 1981; Jorgensen et al., 1983; Lindahl et al., 2001). The non-bonded interactions were evaluated using a twin-range cutoV of 8 and 14 Å. To correct for the neglect of electrostatic interactions beyond the 14-Å cutoV, a reaction Weld (RF) correction with a dielectric constant of 78.0 was used. Interactions within the shorter-range cutoV were evaluated at every step, whereas the interactions within the longer-range cutoV were updated only every Wve steps, together with the pair list. For the simulations in water, the coupling time was set to 1.0 ps and the isothermal compressibility was set to 4.6 £ 10¡5 bar¡1. To maintain constant temperature and pressure, a Berendsen thermostat was used (Berendsen et al., 1984). The protein, uridine, phosphonic acid ion, and solvent were independently coupled to a temperature of 300 K with a coupling time of 0.1 ps. The pressure was held at 1 bar, with a coupling time of 0.2 ps. The bond distances and bond angles of water were constrained using the SETTLE algorithm (Miyamoto and Kollman, 1992). Bond lengths within the protein were constrained with the LINCS algorithm (Hess et al., 1997). The time step used was 2 fs. Snapshots of the PYNP­substrate system were saved every 0.2 ps, and a total of 6000 snapshots were saved. 3. Results and discussion Comparability of the homologous sequence between PYNP of B. subtilis and the template is 66.7%. PYNP of B. subtilis has several loops and diVers from that of B. stearothermophilus. ProWles 3D analysis (ProWle-3D User Guide, 1999) of the model of this enzyme gave a value of 188, compared with an overall self-compatibility score of 198 and a lowest possible score of 89. This is a high Wgure, indicating high probability that the model is correct.

Comparison of the model of the three-dimensional structure of PYNP from B. subtilis with the crystal structure of E. coli TP showed similar distributions of secondary structures. In the secondary structure, there are 17 -helices, labeled H1­H17; a six-stranded mixed -sheet, labeled 1A­ 6A; a four-stranded antiparallel -sheet, labeled 1B­ 4B; and a three-stranded antiparallel -sheet, which are shown in Table 1. Comparison of the model of the three-dimensional structure of PYNP from B. subtilis with the three-dimensional structure of E. coli TP (2.8-Å X-ray diVraction) shows that the B. subtilis PYNP has one more -sheet, labeled 1C­ 3C (Walter et al., 1990). A topology diagram is shown in Fig. 1, which also shows the arrangement and labeling of the secondary structures. Values for the root-mean square deviation (RMSD) from the initial structure are stable after approximately 900 ps, as shown by the Xuctuations stabilizing around average values (Fig. 2A), indicating that the trajectories have equilibrated. The average RMSD for the backbone (excluding hydrogen atoms) is 0.34 § 0.017 Å for molecular dynamics (MD). The most preferential conformation of the complex is shown in Fig. 2B. After MD and QM/ MM calculations, the interactions of the substrate with

residues in the active site are shown in Fig. 3. The phosphate-binding site is located in the / domain, and the residues important in phosphate binding include His82 and His90. The uridine-binding site is located in the cleft between the and / domains, and the residues important in uridine binding include Arg169, Ser184, Lys188, Asp162, Tyr166, and His82. The hydroxyl group of Ser184 forms hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen 3-NH of uridine, the O4 of uridine forms a hydrogen bond with the guanidino group of Arg169, and the O2 of uridine forms a hydrogen bond with -NH3+ group of Lys188. In addition, the distance between the carboxyl of Asp162 and the -NH3+ group of Lys188 is 3.91 Å. The length of the glycosidic bond is increased to 1.66 Å (originally 1.53 Å), so the pyrimidine nucleoside is in a high-energy conformation that would likely put strain on the glycosidic bond. Glycosidic bond strain due to a high-energy nucleoside conformation, which is consistent with the catalytic mechanism proposed for the phosphorolysis of purine nucleosides (Saenger, 1984). To understand the role of each residue in catalysis, we analyzed the energy contribution of individual residues in the PYNP­substrate complex, and the results are shown

in Table 2. The charges for uridine were determined with B3LYP (6-31G¤) QM calculations, and those for PYNP with Kollman charges. The electrostatic and van der Waals' interaction energies between each residue and the pyrimidine ring were calculated classically for uridine with a glycosidic bond length of 1.53 and 1.66 Å, respectively. The atomic charges of diVerent uridine conformations are shown in Fig. 4. The results indicate that as well as a longer glycosidic bond, electrons Xow from the glycosidic bond to the pyrimidine ring. In Table 2, negative values indicate that the residue lowers the energy of uridine, whereas positive values indicate the opposite eVect. Because the eVects of conformational change and dielectric screening are absent in our analysis and QM/MM calculations were performed variationally, we use these values only as a qualitative indicator, rather than as a quantitative prediction. The classical electrostatic contributions of Lys188, Arg169, and His82 to lowering the energy of uridine with a glycosidic bond length of 1.66 Å are approximately ¡34.29, ¡25.36, and ¡15.19 kcal/mol, respectively, as shown in Table 2. Although these values are a qualitative rather than quantitative indicator, they suggest that the classical electrostatic interaction of the three residues is essential for catalysis.

The results indicate that, as well as a longer glycosidic bond and a Xow of electrons from the glycosidic bond to the pyrimidine ring, Lys188, Arg169, and His82 also stabilize the pyrimidine ring. Thus, the function of Lys188, Arg 169, and His82 is to stabilize uridine in a high-energy conformation through electrostatic interactions, with the eVect of Lys188 better than those of Arg169 and His82. Moreover, the distance between the carboxyl of Asp162 and the -NH3+ group of Lys188 is 3.91 Å, and the O2 of uridine forms a hydrogen bond with the -NH3+ group of Lys188. Thus, the function of Asp162 is likely to activate Lys188 for phosphorolytic catalysis through polarization eVects. Based on the structural information of the PYNP­substrate system from this work, a probable mechanism for pyrimidine phosphorolysis, which is similar to an SN1-type reaction, is proposed for PYNP (Saenger, 1984). Fig. 5 shows the positions of the residues around the substrate and the proposed catalytic mechanism. The following three major factors support this polarization. The Wrst is that the nucleoside could bind in a high-energy conformation, which would strain the glycosidic bond. The second is that the Xow of electrons from the glycosidic bond to the pyrimidine ring (presumably to O2 and O4) could be readily stabilized by the positive charges of Arg169 and Lys188. The last is that the resulting partial positive charge at C1 could be stabilized by the formation of an oxocarbenium ion at O4 . Once the partial positive charge at the C1 position has built up, the O1 with a negatively charged phosphate ion is then poised to

attack, resulting in a pyrimidine base and -ribose-1-phosphate as products (Pugmire and Ealick, 1998). Because the O1 of the phosphate ion only forms one hydrogen bond with the 3 OH of the ribose, this O1 is the closest oxygen to the C1 position of the ribose at a distance of 4.19 Å, and appears to be in a position to attack at the C1 position of the pyrimidine nucleoside.
