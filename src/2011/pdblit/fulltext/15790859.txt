synthetic capacity may explain why certain organisms have retained this route. This would be consistent with earlier proposals that CysRS (27, 28) and cysteine itself (22, 29, 30) were the last--or very late--canonical additions to the genetic code. The recent demonstration in mammalian cells (31) of the Ser-tRNASec to Sep-tRNASec conversion by a special kinase Epresent also in archaea (31)^ implicates the Sep moiety as an intermediate in Sec synthesis. As the conversions of Sep-tRNA to Cys-tRNA or Sec-tRNA are chemically analogous (using suitable sulfur or selenium donors, respectively), the addition of selenocysteine to the genetic code may have been patterned on an accepted route for cysteine formation, the SepRS/SepCysS pathway. Note added in proof: A recently published bioinformatics analysis has suggested that Mj1660 is a class II CysRS (32).

Structural Insights into the Activity of Enhancer-Binding Proteins

Activators of bacterial s54­RNA polymerase holoenzyme are mechanochemical proteins that use adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to activate transcription. We have determined by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) a 20 angstrom resolution structure of an activator, phage shock protein F [PspF(1-275)], which is bound to an ATP transition state analog in complex with its basal factor, s54. By fitting the crystal structure of PspF(1-275) at 1.75 angstroms into the EM map, we identified two loops involved in binding s54. Comparing enhancer-binding structures in different nucleotide states and mutational analysis led us to propose nucleotide-dependent conformational changes that free the loops for association with s54. Gene expression is regulated at the level of RNA polymerase (RNAP) activity. Bacterial RNAP containing the s54 factor requires specialized activator proteins, referred to as bacterial enhancer-binding proteins (EBPs), that interact with the basal transcription complex from remote DNA sites by DNA looping (1­4). EBPs bind upstream activating sequences via

their C-terminal DNA binding domains and form higher order oligomers that use adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to activate transcription (5, 6). The central s54-RNAP­ interacting domain of EBPs is responsible for adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity and transcription activation (7­9) and belongs to the larger AAAþ (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) family of proteins (10­12). Well-studied EBPs include phage shock protein F (PspF), nitrogen-fixation protein A (NifA), nitrogen-regulation protein C (NtrC), and C4-dicarboxylic acid transport protein D (DctD) (1­3, 7, 13).

PspF from Escherichia coli forms a stable oligomeric complex with s54 at the point of ATP hydrolysis (14). PspF-ADP.AlFx (a complex of adenosine diphosphate and aluminum fluoride, where x is the number of fluorine atoms equal to 3 or 4) alters the interaction between s54 and promoter DNA similarly to PspF hydrolyzing ATP (15) and was thus deemed a functional hydrolysis intermediate. Activator nucleotide hydrolysis­dependent events couple the chemical energy of hydrolysis to transcriptional activation. The highly conserved and EBP-specific GAFTGA amino acid motif (fig. S1) (16) is a crucial mechanical determinant for the successful transfer of energy from ATP hydrolysis in EBPs to the RNAP holoenzyme via the small N-terminal EBP-interacting domain of s54 (called region I, È56 residues and sufficient for PspF interaction) (1, 14, 17­19). The lack of structural information has hindered progress toward understanding the basis of this energy transfer process required for transcriptional activation. We now present a structure-function analysis of one such system using the following: (i) a cryo-EM reconstruction of PspF_s AAAþ domain Eresidues 1 to 275, PspF(1-275)^ in complex with s54 at the point of ATP hydrolysis (mimicked by in situ­ formed ADP.AlFx), (ii) the crystal structure of nucleotide-free (apo) PspF(1-275) at 1.75 ) resolution, and (iii) mutational analysis. Nanoelectrospray mass spectroscopy of a PspF(1-275)­s54 complex with ADP.AlFx established that six monomers of PspF(1-275) are in complex with a monomeric s54, consistent with AAAþ proteins functioning as hexamers (10, 12).

struction of the PspF(1-275)­ADP.AlFx­s54 complex (È240 kD) obtained by cryo-EM of native samples (figs. S3 and S4) shows a PspF(1-275) hexamer interacting with one s54. Class averages show well-defined ringlike structures displaying six subunits of PspF(1-275) within a simple ring and clear extra density for s54 located È15 ) above the ring (Fig. 1, A to C). The clear hexagonal ring structure has a diameter of È125 ) and a central pore of È20 ); from the side, the ring is È40 ) in height (Fig. 1C and fig. S5B). These dimensions are consistent with other hexameric AAAþ proteins (20, 21). Viewed from the side, the hexamer appears concave, with a central depression that readily accommodates the s54 density. A 90- rotation along the sixfold axis reveals that the s54 density, which runs along the ring, is elongated, bent, and thicker in the middle (fig. S5A). This Bhorseshoe[-shaped extra density resembles the envelope model of s54 (22). The estimated mass of s54 is È30 kD, which is much higher than the 6-kD region I and less than the 54-kD s54. Therefore, we postulate that although we see more than just region I, which is sufficient for PspF binding, there are parts of s54 that are not visualized in our reconstruction because they are mobile (23). To confirm the presence and integrity of s54 in the particles, we marked N- and Ctermini of s54 using nanogold beads. Singlecysteine s54 constructs E46Cs54 and 474Cs54 (24)^ were covalently linked to nanogold beads before forming the PspF(1-275)­ADP.AlFx­s54 complex. The negative stained samples were then analyzed with EM. Detection of nanogold beads in both experiments confirmed the presence and the integrity of s54 in the complex (Fig. 1D). When displayed at lower contour levels, the 3D electron density map shows weak densities connecting the PspF(1-275) ring to s54 (Fig. 1C, arrow). Based on earlier biochemical results (14, 18), we postulate that the connecting densities, found almost at right angles to the PspF(1-275) ring (Fig. 1C), mark the location of certain GAFTGA motifs within the PspF(1-275) hexamer in stable association with region I of s54. To facilitate localizing PspF, we determined the crystal structure of apo PspF(1-275) in space group P65 at 1.75 ) resolution using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing (table S1) (25). The structure displays a typical AAAþ protein organization, consisting of an a/b Rossmann fold followed by an a-helical domain (Fig. 2). The GAFTGA motif forms the tip of a loop (L1) inserted into helix 3 of the a/b domain. Another loop (L2), consisting of residues 130 to 139, is inserted between helix 4 and strand 4 (Fig. 2). The extremities of both loops (L1 and L2) show high degrees of flexibility, with the tip of L1 being the most flexible, and no electron

density was observed for this region (residues 82 to 89). Initially, a monomer of PspF(1-275) was visually fitted into the EM map as a rigid body, so that the a-helical domain sat in a Bclaw[ of the ring (Fig. 3A). This fitting positioned the L1 and L2 loops in close proximity to one of the weak connecting densities contacting s54 (Fig. 3, A and B). From the fitted model, we generated a hexamer and then visually readjusted individual subunits to better fit the EM map. L1 and L2 loops were either adjusted to fit the connecting densities or removed when no EM density was observed to account for them (fig. S6, A and B) (25). It appears that at least two adjacent PspF(1-275) monomers contact one s54 at the point of ATP hydrolysis. We infer that at the point of ATP hydrolysis, certain L1 and L2 loops extend upward to maintain a stable interaction of PspF with s54. When successfully engaged with s54, L1 and L2 are more structured. To investigate the link between the nucleotide-bound state and the location of the GAFTGA-containing L1, we compared the apo PspF structure with the structures of different forms of Aquifex aeolicus NtrC1 (Protein Data Bank codes 1NY5 and 1NY6), which has 47% sequence similarity to PspF in its AAAþ domain, including an ADP-bound state thought to be incompetent for stable s54 interaction (3). Our apo PspF(1-275) crystal structure and that of ATP-soaked crystals (data not shown) are similar, suggesting that the apostructure presented here is close to the ATP bound form, which is s54-interaction competent (15). Aligning on the conserved P loops resulted in overall good alignment (Fig. 4A), with differences in the relative orientation of the a-helical domain to the a/b domain as well as the position of helices 3 and 4, suggesting a nucleotidedependent change in domain relationships (12, 26). Closer examination reveals important differences in the properties and positions of L1 and L2 (Fig. 4, A to C). In NtrC1 (1NY6), the branch part of L1 is at a right angle to the stem part and points into the central pore of the ring, with a twisted L2 lying in close proximity (Fig. 4B) (13). Discrete interactions stabilize the branch part of L1 in NtrC1, notably the interactions between E212 in L1 (equivalent to E81 in PspF) and R262 (R131) and K267 (Q136) in L2 (16). Also, L263 (V132) of the tip of L2, F216 (F85) of the L1 tip, and A206 Ethe b carbon atom (Cb) of S75^ of helix 3 form a hydrophobic cluster that locks the GAFTGA motif in a buried and unfavorable conformation for stable s54 interaction (Fig. 4B and fig. S1). Based on our EM map, in this conformation the GAFTGA motif cannot stably contact s54. In PspF(1-275), the relative rotation of helices 3 and 4 disrupts the hydrophobic interactions between F85 of L1, V132 of L2,

and Cb of S75 of helix 3, whereas interactions between the stem part of L1 and helix 3 (i.e., between H80 and S75, and H92 and E76) are strengthened (Fig. 4C). We hypothesize that these changes in interactions are nucleotide dependent. Indeed, these interactions form part of a larger network that involves residues R95 and R98 of helix 3, and S62 of the central b sheet, which includes the Walker B motif (D107 and E108) and is responsible for nucleotide hydrolysis (Fig. 4C). This interaction network is well suited to relay nucleotidedependent movements of the central b sheet, which originate in the Walker B motif, to helix VOL 307

3 and more importantly to L1, with its GAFTGA motif. A similar network in NtrC1 appears to be based mostly on hydrophobic interactions To investigate the functionality of the interaction network believed to ultimately control the GAFTGA-containing L1, we conducted structure-based single amino acid mutational analyses. Disruption of the proposed network linking the ATP active site to the GAFTGA loop is predicted to cause a decrease in nucleotide-dependent activities of PspF(1-275). To examine this hypothesis, we mutated H92, which interacts with E76 of

helix 3 (Fig. 4C), either into F, to mimic the overall geometry while eliminating the charge effects, or into R, to maintain the overall charge (R is also the most frequent residue in this position in EBPs) (fig. S1). R95, on the other hand, which interacts with both E76 and S62 of the central b sheet, was mutated into either A or the more related K. PspF(1-275)R95A and PspF(1-275)H92F each fail in all measurable post­ATP binding activities (fig. S1 and table S2) (27). In both cases, the mutations severely disrupt the network of interactions and thus block any communication of the conformational signal beyond the mutated residues. In contrast, PspF(1-275)R95K and PspF(1-275)H92R retained most of the in vitro activities measured, including transcriptional activation (table S2). The Walker B­ to­L1 network is consistent with properties of many mutant forms of DctD and NtrC (28, 29), supporting the existence of a common EBP nucleotide-dependent communication pathway.

To determine the functionality of the hydrophobic interactions that lock the tip of L1 in the NtrC1 structure, we mutated F85 and V132. PspF(1-275)V132A retained its nucleotidebinding activity but lacked ATPase activity. PspF(1-275)F85A likewise lacked ATPase activity, but PspF(1-275)F85L and PspF(1-275)F85W showed ATP binding and some ATPase activity, with mutation to W leading to an increase in ATPase activity (table S2). These results suggest that the stability of the L1-L2 hydrophobic interaction has direct effects on the ATP hydrolysis cycle. PspF(1-275)V132A can engage s54 in an ADP.AlFx-dependent manner, suggesting an effect on the release of g-phosphate (table S2). Disrupting this interaction would impair this stage of the ATPase cycle, whereas strengthening it Ee.g., PspF(1-275)F85W^ would increase ATPase activity. PspF(1-275)F85W fails to stably bind s54, demonstrating that the integrity of the GAFTGA motif is crucial for s54 interaction (15, 18). The proposed communication pathway in PspF SCIENCE VOL 307
