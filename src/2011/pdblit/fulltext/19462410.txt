A novel ligand-binding site with functional implications has been identified in phospholipase A2 (PLA2). The binding of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent indomethacin at this site blocks both catalytic and anti-coagulant actions of PLA2. A group IIA PLA2 has been isolated from Daboia russelli pulchella (Russell's viper) which is enzymatically active as well as induces a strong anti-coagulant action. The binding studies have shown that indomethacin reduces the effects of both anti-coagulant and pro-inflammatory actions of PLA2. A group IIA PLA2 was co-crystallized with indomethacin ° and the structure of the complex has been determined at 1.4 A resolution. The structure determination has revealed the presence of an indomethacin molecule in the structure of PLA2 at a site which is distinct from the conventional substrate-binding site. One of the carboxylic group oxygen atoms of indomethacin interacts with Asp 49 and His 48 through the catalytically important water molecule OW 18 while the second carboxylic oxygen atom forms an ionic interaction with the side chain of Lys 69. It is well known that the residues, His 48 and Asp 49 are essential for catalysis while Lys 69 is a part of the anti-coagulant loop (residues, 54­77). Indomethacin binds in such a manner that it blocks the access to both, it works as a dual inhibitor for catalytic and anti-coagulant actions of PLA2. This new binding site in PLA2 has been observed for the first time and indomethacin is the first compound that has been shown to bind at this novel site resulting in the prevention of anti-coagulation and inflammation.

INTRODUCTION
Phospholipase A2 (PLA2, EC.3.1.1.4) enzyme specifically hydrolyses the 2-acyl ester bond of membrane phospholipids to produce arachidonic acid which is used as a substrate by the enzymes cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipooxygenase (LOX) (Smith et al., 2000) resulting in the production of eicosaniods (Dennis, 1983). In addition to catalytic action, snake venom PLA2 induces several pharmacological disorders including neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, cardiotoxicity as well as anti-coagulant, haemolytic, oedemainducing and platelet effects (Kini, 1997). Initially, it was thought that the catalytic activity and pharmacological properties were related and all the effects were based on the hydrolysis of specific and critical phospholipids (Rudrammaji et al., 2001). On the other hand, it has been reported that the pharmacological effects of venom PLA2 are not necessarily dependent on their catalytic function and that it might be based only on the protein­protein interactions involving a specific site on the protein surface (Kerns et al., 1999; Kini, 2005). These pharmacological sites are neither defined clearly nor their mode of interactions are characterized. Therefore, the potent chemical compounds have not been

designed so far for preventing the interactions of these sites so as to control the harmful pharmacological effects. On the other hand the catalytic residues and the substratebinding site are well characterized in PLA2 enzymes. Threedimensional structures of various isoforms of PLA2 from a number of sources have been determined (Thunnissen et al., 1990; Scott et al., 1990; Scott et al., 1991; Chandra et al., 2001; Singh et al., 2001; Banumathi et al., 2001; Gu et al., 2002; Matoba et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2003a, 2003b; Jasti et al., 2004; Lok et al., 2005). There have also been extensive investigations to understand their

N. SINGH ET AL. catalytic actions and various ligands have also been designed to inhibit their enzymatic function. The structures of several complexes of PLA2 with natural compounds (Chandra et al., 2002a, 2002d; Singh et al., 2006a), substrate analogues (Scott et al., 1990; Thunnissen et al., 1990; Scott et al., 1991; Sekar et al., 1997; Epstein et al., 2001; Pan et al., 2001; Hansford et al., 2003) and with other designed synthetic compounds (Schevitz et al., 1995; Chandra et al., 2002b, 2002c; Singh et al., 2003) have also been reported. The anti-inflammatory response of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been attributed to their binding to PLA2 (Singh et al., 2004, 2005, 2006b; Jabeen et al., 2005) and COX enzymes (Vane et al., 1998; Vane and Botting, 1998; Gierse et al., 1999). The anti-coagulant activity was first detected in snake venom PLA2 some decades ago (Boffa et al., 1976, 1980). It was reported that the anti-coagulant potency in various snake venom PLA2 varied greatly. According to their potencies, the PLA2 were classified into strong, weak and non-coagulant molecules (Verheij et al., 1980; Kini and Evans, 1987). The anti-coagulant site has been suggested to exist between residues 54­77. Although the precise nature of the structure of anti-coagulant loop is not yet clearly understood, it is indicated that the presence of basic residues at specific positions in the segment 54­77 contributes to the strong anti-coagulant action of PLA2. The present isoform of PLA2 from Daboia russelli pulchella contain five basic residues in the loop 54­77 indicating its potential to be a strong anti-coagulant. However, the mode of ligand binding for inhibiting the anti-coagulant action of PLA2 is not understood and hence the molecules could not be designed to stop the anti-coagulant effect of PLA2. Indomethacin is a well-known non-selective COX-2 inhibitor (Callan et al., 1996). In recent studies, indomethacin has also been reported to inhibit group II PLA2 but its unusual kinetic properties (Kaplan et al., 1978; Lobo and Hoult, 1994) could not be explained. The studies indicated very different binding characteristics when compared with other ligands that bind to PLA2 enzymes at the substrate-binding site. It was also reported that indomethacin abolishes the antithrombotic effect of PLA2 (Nygard et al., 1995). This indicated that indomethacin might be involved in blocking its anti-coagulant binding site. In order to understand the mode of binding of indomethacin to PLA2 and the mechanisms of its actions against both catalytic and anti-coagulant actions, PLA2 was co-crystallized with indomethacin and the detailed threedimensional structure of the complex with indomethacin has ° been determined at 1.4 A resolution. The structure determination of the complex of PLA2 with indomethacin has revealed a remarkable new ligand-binding site in PLA2. At this position, indomethacin binds to residues that are important for catalytic activity of the enzyme as well as for its anti-coagulant action. This suggests that ligands can be designed to block more than one function of PLA2. PLA2 was analysed on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) (Kratos, Shimadzu, Japan). The protein showed a single band on SDS-PAGE and a molecular weight of 13613 Da with MALDI-TOF. The determination of N-terminal sequence of first 20 amino acids indicated it to be a group IIA PLA2 (Chandra et al., 2001).

Kinetics and inhibition studies The kinetics studies of PLA2 were carried out using a chromogenic-based assay utilizing the conversion of hexadecylphosphocholine (HePC) into sulphahydril molecule by PLA2. HePC is a detergent substrate for PLA2 enzymes (Ikeda et al., 1984). The presence of the sulfahydril product is detected colorimetrically using Ellman's reagent [5,50 -dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB)], which forms a yellow product with the released sulfahydril. The assay was performed using a PLA2 Detection Kit (Assay Designs, Inc., catalogue No. 907-002). 100­500 mM concentrations of HePC and 0.1 mM of PLA2 in 1 ml of reaction buffer were used for the assay at 258C. 10 ml of colouring agent (DTNB) was added in each assay reaction. Indomethacin concentrations of 0.10, 0.20, 0.30 and 0.40 mM were used for studying its inhibitory effects on PLA2 catalysed reaction. The assay included a 30 min incubation of enzyme with indomethacin before adding the substrate in the reaction vial and the absorbance was measured at wavelength of 405 nm on a Perkin-Elmer UV spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, USA). All the measurements were repeated three times for estimating mean errors. In order to determine the nature of interactions, the observed reaction rates were plotted against substrate concentrations using Lineweaver-Burk method.

Measurements of binding of indomethacin to PLA2 The binding studies of indomethacin and PLA2 carried out using the BIACORE-2000 biosensor (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) installed at National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi. The sensor chips CM5, surfactant P20, the amine coupling kit containing N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), N-ethyl-N0 -3 (diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and ethanolamine hydrochloride were used. The running buffer used was 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 0.005% surfactant P20. The immobilization of PLA2 was performed at a flow rate of 10 ml/min at 258C. The dextran molecules on the chip were equilibrated with running buffer and carbomethylated matrix was activated with an EDC/NHS mixture. 210 ml of PLA2 (50 mg/ml) in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.8) was injected to the running buffer and unreacted groups were blocked by injection of ethanolamine (pH 8.5). The SPR signal for immobilized PLA2 was found to be 5049YRUs. The association of indomethacin to PLA2 was determined by injecting 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mg/ml of indomethacin separately at different cycles in 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) with 5 mM CaCl2 at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The dissociation of indomethacin was initiated by 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.0). The regeneration of the immobilized protein was performed using 10 mM glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.5). The kinetic parameters were obtained using the BIAevaluation software package (Nieba et al., 1996). The association (kon) and dissociation (koff ) rate constants for indomethacin binding to PLA2 were calculated and the value of the equilibrium constant (Kd) was estimated by the mass action relation, Kd ¼ koff/kon.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Purification of PLA2 The PLA2 used in these studies was purified from the venom of Russell's viper (Daboia russelli pulchella). The venom was obtained from the Irula Cooperative Snake Farm in Tamil Nadu, India. A locally developed method involving Cibacron blue affinity matrix and cation-exchange CM-Sephadex-C-25 columns were used for producing purified samples of PLA2 (Chandra et al., 2001). The

STRUCTURE OF PHOSPHOLIPASE A2 COMPLEX WITH INDOMETHACIN In vitro studies for anti-coagulant/coagulation tests The human blood of patients was obtained from the Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India and immediately mixed with 3.2% tri-sodium citrate to make the ratio of blood/tri-sodium citrate as 9:1. The whole blood was centrifuged using centrifuge Digicen 20-R (Orto Alresa, Madrid, Spain) at 3500 rpm for 5­10 min at 20 8C. The plasma samples were divided in three groups as control group, PLA2 treated group and PLA2 þ indomethacin treated group. The concentration of PLA2 used was 100 mg/ml, whereas the concentration of indomethacin used was 0.4 mg/ml. The clotting time was measured using STA Compact fully automated coagulometer (France). Coagulation test The effect of indomethacin on the anti-coagulant activity of the PLA2 was determined using two methods by measuring-- prothrombin time and thrombin time. Since both prothrombin and thrombin are present at the coagulation site, the assays for both thrombin and prothrombin were done in order to locate the inhibition of PLA2 in the extrinsic coagulation cascade (Stefansson et al., 1989). (a) Prothrombin time measurements: The prothrombin time was measured by adding 100 ml of plasma respectively from three groups as indicated above to 200 ml of thromboplastin reagent. The time in seconds was automatically measured by the instrument coagulometer. (b) Thrombin time measurements: The thrombin time was measured by adding 200 ml of plasma respectively from three groups to 200 ml of thrombin reagent. The thrombin time in seconds were automatically measured by the instrument coagulometer. Crystallization The purified samples of PLA2 were dissolved in 5 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.0. Indomethacin was dissolved in the same buffer, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 containing 10% acetonitrile. Both samples were mixed together at a PLA2/indomethacin molar ratio of 1:50. The solution was incubated for 3 h and then kept for crystallization using hanging drop vapour diffusion method. The drops containing 10 ml of protein sample was mixed with 5 ml of reservoir solution containing 0.2 M ammonium sulphate and 30% PEG-4000 (w/v). The drops were equilibrated against the reservoir solution and kept for crystallization at 208C. The crystals grew to a maximum size of 0.4 Â 0.2 Â 0.2 mm after 2 weeks. X-ray intensity data collection The crystals of the complex formed between PLA2 and indomethacin were stabilized in 0.3 M ammonium sulphate containing 30% PEG-4000 (w/v) for data collection at low temperature. A single crystal was mounted in a nylon loop and flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. The data were collected on a 345 mm diameter MAR research scanner with ° 1.54 A radiation generated by a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode X-ray Generator filled with Osmic mirrors (Rigaku USA, Woodlands TX, USA). The data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK from HKL package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The ° final data set was complete to 99.2% up to 1.4 A resolution. The

N. SINGH ET AL. were used as a search model. The rotation and translation ° functions calculated with data in the resolution range, 12.0­3.5 A yielded a unique solution with the first peak being very distinct. The stacking arrangement of the molecules in the unit cell for this solution yielded no unfavourable intermolecular contacts in space group P43 thus confirming it to be the correct space group. The transformed coordinates using AMoRe were subjected to 20 cycles of rigid-body refinement with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) from the CCP4 software suit (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). This reduced the R and Rfree factors to 24.3 and 26.6% respectively (2% of the reflections were used for the calculation of Rfree and were not included in the refinement). The manual model building of the protein using j2FoÀFcj Fourier and jFoÀFcj difference Fourier maps was carried out with the Graphics Program O (Jones et al., 1991) on a Silicon Graphics O2 Workstation. A continuous non-protein electron density at 1.5 s cut off was observed in the proximity of the active site that extended in a direction parallel to helix H2. The ligand was only included because it was well defined by unbiased (i.e. before inclusion of any ligand) jFoÀFcj map. The coordinates of indomethacin structure were taken from the studies of Cox and Manson (2003) and were fitted into the characteristic electron density (Figure 1). Occupancy refinement was done for indomethacin using SHELXL (Sheldrick and Schneider, 1997) which showed 77% occupancy for the ligand in the complex. Water molecules were added using ARP/REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997). The presence of three sulphate ions was also detected from the difference jFoÀFcj Fourier maps. Further anisotropic refinement was carried after adding the coordinates of indomethacin molecule, three sulphate ions and 256 water molecules. The final Rcryst and Rfree factors for the complete ° data in the resolution range of 20.0-1.4 A were 0.190 and 0.207 respectively (Table 1). The atomic coordinates of this structure have been deposited to protein data bank (PDB).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Inhibition of PLA2 by indomethacin The data generated by kinetics measurements clearly indicate that indomethacin inhibits the action of PLA2 but unlike other known inhibitors of PLA2 (Sekar et al., 1997; Epstein et al., 2001; Pan et al., 2001; Chandra et al., 2002a, 2002d; Hansford et al., 2003; Singh et al., 2004, 2005, 2006a, 2006b) it acts initially at low rate but picks up after its concentration is raised beyond 50 mM. Similar results were reported earlier using group II PLA2 from Russell's viper (Kaplan et al., 1978). The maximum inhibition was recorded up to 74% with 750 ml concentration of indomethacin. A more accurate binding parameter for indomethacin has been obtained using SPR data. The analysis was carried out using BIAevaluation software (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden) (Nieba et al., 1996). The association (kon) and dissociation (koff ) rate constants for the binding of indomethacin to PLA2 were calculated to be 1.0 Â 102/MS and 1.3 Â 10À4/S respectively. From these two values the value of the equilibrium constant (Kd) was calculated to be 1.3 Æ 0.2 Â 10À6/M. Inhibition of anti-coagulant effect The inhibition of anti-coagulation effect of PLA2 by indomethacin on human plasma was determined by prothrombin time. The normal prothrombin time ranges from 11.5­15.5 s. It was observed that the addition of PLA2 increased the prothrombin time from 12.5 s in control to 22.5 s in PLA2 group. The addition of indomethacin reduced the anti-coagulation effect of PLA2 to 16.7 s (Figure 2). The inhibition by indomethacin of the anti-coagulation effect of PLA2 on human plasma was also determined by measuring the thrombin time. The normal range of thrombin time is 15­21 s. It was found that addition of PLA2 did not interfere in thrombin time coagulation. All the values from three groups were within normal range. Quality of the final model The final model consists of 944 protein atoms, 25 atoms of indomethacin molecule, three sulphate ions and 256 water

STRUCTURE OF PHOSPHOLIPASE A2 COMPLEX WITH INDOMETHACIN molecules. The final j2FoÀFcj electron density map is continuous and well defined for both the backbone and the side chains of the protein. The r.m.s. deviations in bond lengths and ° angles are 0.01 A and 2.28 respectively. As calculated using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), 91.3% of the residues fall in the most favourable regions while the remaining 8.7% residues were observed in the additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran and Sasisekharan, 1968). The refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The refined atomic coordinates of the final structure have been deposited in the PDB with accession code 3H1X. Binding of indomethacin at new ligand-binding site Indomethacin placed in the new ligand-binding site formed by parts of helix H1, H2 and loop between helices H2 and H3. It is held parallel to helix H2 and forms interactions with surrounding residues (Figure 4a). The surface figure indicates that indomethacin fills the binding space at the new ligand site (Figure 4b). It did not seem to have diffused into protein from the same route of hydrophobic channel used by the substrate, substrate analogues and a number of ligands studied so far. However, it interacts with the residues involved in both hydrolytic and anti-coagulant activities (Table 2). Therefore, at this position indomethacin blocks both functions of PLA2 that include the

Overall structure The structure of PLA2 contains an N-terminal helix, H1 (residues: 2­12), a calcium-binding loop (residues: 25­35), a second a-helix, H2 (residues: 40­55), a short two stranded antiparallel b-sheet (residues: 75­84), referred to as the b-wing and a third a-helix, H3 (residues: 90­108) (Figure 3). The two helices H2 and H3 that form the core of the protein structure are antiparallel to each other. The overall folding of PLA2 observed in the complex with indomethacin is essentially same to that of native PLA2 (Chandra ° et al., 2001) with an r.m.s. shift of 0.7 A for the Ca positions. The only notable difference in the backbone folding of PLA2 when compared with the native structure (Chandra et al., 2001) was observed in the flexible calcium-binding loop. In the present structure calcium ion is not present in the calcium binding loop. This position is occupied by a water molecule. It has been shown before that the presence of a calcium ion is not essential for the activity of the PLA2 (Chandra et al., 2001).

conversion of phospholipids into arachidonic acid and anti-coagulant activity. Inhibition of catalytic activity As seen from Figure 4, indomethacin is located at an adjacent space to helix H2. Although the conventional substrate-binding site is empty, indomethacin still interacts effectively with the important residues of active site including, Asp 49 and His 48. O3 atom of the carboxylic group of indomethacin interacts with the catalytically important water molecule OW 18 in a manner

similar to those reported earlier with other inhibitors (Singh et al., 2004, 2005, 2006a, 2006b; Jabeen et al., 2005) and substrate analogues (Scott et al., 1990; Thunnissen et al., 1990; Scott et al., 1991; Sekar et al., 1997; Epstein et al., 2001; Pan et al., 2001; Hansford et al., 2003). In turn, OW 18 is hydrogen bonded to both His 48 Nd1 and Asp 49 Od1. OW 18 also forms a hydrogen bond with Cys 45 O. The carboxylic oxygen atom O3 also forms hydrogen bond with another water molecule OW 41 which in turn is hydrogen bonded to Gly 30 N. It also forms a hydrogen bond with one more water molecule OW 158 (Figure 5). The new-binding site does not overlap with the

A superimposition of the structures of PLA2 complex with indomethacin and diclofenac reveal that the two drugs bind to PLA2 without interfering with the binding space of each other (Figure 6) and can form drugs of relevance for proximity. Inhibition of anti-coagulant action The anti-coagulation region has been identified between residues 54 and 77 (Kini and Evans, 1987). This anti-coagulant region is positively charged with residues such as Lys 69, Arg 72, Arg 74, Lys 76 and Arg 77. It is remarkable to observe that carboxylic group oxygen atom O2 of indomethacin forms an ionic interaction with the side chain of Lys 69 at a ° distance of 2.6 A. In addition, indomethacin forms an array of van der Waals contacts with residues Pro 56, Cys 61, Asn 67 and Pro 68. As seen from Figure 4, indomethacin blocks the space on the side of anti-coagulant segment to interact with other molecules. Structure of indomethacin The binding of indomethacin does not alter the structure of PLA2 while indomethacin undergoes two notable variations in its structure (Figure 7). The chlorobenzene moiety in the complex has rotated by more than 308, whereas the carboxylic group has

rotated by 808 with respect to its conformation in the crystal structure of indomethacin. The orientation of chlorobenzene moiety of indomethacin in the present complex is identical to its orientation in the complex with that observed in the structure of indomethacin complexed with COX-2 enzyme (Kurumbail et al., 1996) but the rotation of carboxylic group is different by 1808 (Table 3).

CONCLUSIONS
This is the first structure that shows a ligand that can bind to PLA2 at a site other than the conventional substrate-binding site and yet with a significant affinity of 1.3 Â 10À6/M. Indomethacin binds in such a manner that it interacts with residues which are important for catalytic activity of PLA2 and hence inhibits the enzymatic function. The fact that it does not bind at the substrate-binding site makes it a useful drug to use it in combination with other anti-inflammatory drugs which bind at the conventional binding site. A superimposition of the complexes of diclofenac and indomethacin with PLA2 shows that the two compounds bind at the non-overlapping sites (Figure 7). It also interacts with the residues which are important for its anti-coagulant action as well as it physically hinders the binding of anti-coagulant region of PLA2 to other target proteins thus contributing to prevent the anti-coagulant role of PLA2. Therefore, indomethacin provides a good example of a single

compound involved in two functions simultaneously, which make it an excellent model for ligand design for inhibiting catalytic and pharmacological actions of snake venom PLA2.
