Stoddard3,* 1 Graduate Programs in Biomolecular Structure and Design and Molecular and Cellular Biology University of Washington Seattle, Washington 98195 2 Centre de recherche sur la Fonction la structure et l'Ingenierie des Proteines Pavillon Charles-Eugene Marchand Universite Laval Quebec G1K 7P4 Canada 3 Division of Basic Sciences Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center 1100 Fairview Avenue North Seattle, Washington 98109 At least four homing enzyme families have been identified (Belfort and Roberts, 1997; Chevalier and Stoddard, 2001). The largest family, LAGLIDADG, contains several hundred identified members, many of which are functional endonucleases (Dalgaard et al., 1997). The conserved LAGLIDADG sequence motif forms the core of the interface between endonuclease domains or subunits, and it also contributes conserved residues to the active sites (Duan et al., 1997; Heath et al., 1997). Endonucleases containing a single motif per polypeptide chain form homodimers that are generally constrained to cleavage of symmetric or nearly symmetric target sites. Gene fusion of these ORFS generates single-chain endonucleases, with each domain containing a single LAGLIDADG motif. The descendents of these initial fused enzymes are not constrained to recognition of symmetric targets, providing an evolutionary advantage for themselves and their associated introns or inteins. Therefore, the LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease family provides an excellent model system for the study of divergence in DNA binding protein specificities through gene fusion events and subsequent acquisition of asymmetric target site recognition properties. The basic structure/function relationships within LAGLIDADG endonucleases have been particularly well characterized for the homodimeric enzyme I-CreI (Chevalier et al., 2001, 2003, 2004; Durrenberger and Rochaix, 1993; Jurica et al., 1998; Thompson et al., 1992; Wang et al., 1997), the monomeric enzyme I-SceI (Moure et al., 2003; Perrin et al., 1993), and the intein-associated enzyme PI-SceI (Christ et al., 1999; Duan et al., 1997; Gimble et al., 2003; Gimble and Wang, 1996; He et al., 1998; Moure et al., 2002; Wende et al., 1996). These enzymes recognize long DNA target sites (22 pairs and longer), cleaving across the minor groove to generate cohesive 4 base, 30 overhangs. The enzymes bind their physiological target sites with dissociation constants ranging from 1 to 10 nM, and they exhibit rates of DNA strand cleavage of w0.1­1.0 min21. Estimates of overall site specificity for LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases approach 1 in 109 (Argast et al., 1998; Chevalier et al., 2003; Gimble et al., 2003). The diversification and spread of LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases have been elegantly visualized in green algal chloroplast genomes (Lucas et al., 2001; Turmel et al., 1993a, 1993b, 1995). The comparison of group I introns and their associated endonuclease ORFS within a single gene (the chloroplast large subunit [LSU] rDNA) demonstrates that at least 13 separate positions in that gene are interrupted by introns in a significant fraction of algal species (Figure 1A) (Turmel et al., 1993a). Many of these positions contain introns with LAGLIDADG endonuclease ORFS; the individual sites generally contain sequences encoding either homodimeric or monomeric endonucleases (Turmel et al., 1993a). These introns have been cloned and sequenced from a wide variety of species of green algae, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (the source of the I-CreI endonuclease), Monomastix sp. M722 (the source of I-MsoI), and Chlamydomonas eugametos (the source of

Summary Homing endonucleases are highly specific catalysts of DNA strand breaks, leading to the transfer of mobile intervening sequences containing the endonuclease ORF. We have determined the structure and DNA recognition behavior of I-CeuI, a homodimeric LAGLIDADG endonuclease from Chlamydomonas eugametos. This symmetric endonuclease displays unique structural elaborations on its core enzyme fold, and it preferentially cleaves a highly asymmetric target site. This latter property represents an early step, prior to gene fusion, in the generation of asymmetric DNA binding platforms from homodimeric ancestors. The divergence of the sequence, structure, and target recognition behavior of homing endonucleases, as illustrated by this study, leads to the invasion of novel genomic sites by mobile introns during evolution. Introduction Homing is the process by which mobile intervening genetic sequences are duplicated into cognate recipient alleles (Belfort and Perlman, 1995; Belfort et al., 1995; Belfort and Roberts, 1997; Chevalier and Stoddard, 2001; Dujon, 1989). The process is induced by an endonuclease encoded by a reading frame embedded within the intervening sequence. The endonuclease specifically recognizes a DNA target site corresponding to the intron insertion site, generates a DNA double-strand break, and induces cellular mechanisms to repair the break. If the intron-containing allele is used as a template, the endonuclease ORF is duplicated into the target site. Transfer of mobile introns can be extremely efficient, and they can occur between different subcellular compartments of unrelated organisms (Turmel et al., 1995) and allow introns to overrun diverse genetic lineages (Cho et al., 1998).

Figure 1. Phylogenetic Location and Structures of Algal Homing Endonucleases in This Study (A) Distribution of group I introns and homing endonuclease ORFs in the chloroplast LSU rRNA gene from various green algae. Hosts containing HEs of the I-CeuI family are restricted to the advanced class Chlorophyceae, whereas hosts containing HEs of the I-CreI/I-MsoI family are found in all four classes of the Chlorophyta. Only the nodes supported by more than 50% bootstrap values are shown; the nodes with less than 50% support have been collapsed. The subfamilies of the group I introns identified in the chloroplast large subunit rRNA gene of green algal taxa are denoted by symbols (black triangles: IA1 introns; black squares: IA3 introns; black circles: IB4 introns). The number associated with each insertion site corresponds to the position of the introns relative to E. coli 23S rRNA. Filled symbols represent introns hosting a putative HE gene. HEs whose activities have been experimentally demonstrated are denoted by asterisks. The I-CeuI, I-CreI, and MsoI HEs are denoted by the ``cross'' symbol and by red boxes.

homodimeric I-CeuI, encoded within a group I intron located at a different position in the same gene). I-CreI and I-MsoI are both encoded within the L6 loop of a group I intron that is inserted between base pairs 2593 and 2594 in the LSU rRNA gene (Lucas et al., 2001). The DNA bound structures of these two enzymes have been determined (Chevalier et al., 2003). The enzyme sequences are 38% identical (Figure 2A), display identical secondary structure elements and an rmsd be° tween all conserved atoms of 1.3 A, and have identical catalytic side chains, implying similar catalytic mechanisms (Chevalier et al., 2004). Their DNA target sites are 64% and 45% palindromic, respectively (Figure 2B). Despite nearly identical protein structures and DNA target site sequences, only 5 of the 25 residues in I-CreI that contact the DNA target are conserved in both identity and function in I-MsoI. These differences reflect a remarkable ability, during divergence of these enzymes,

for compensatory mutations to maintain recognition of similar target sites while continuing to maximize and extend flexibility of DNA recognition. In contrast, I-CeuI is encoded within the L6 loop of distinct group I intron that is inserted between base pairs 1923 and 1924 of the same host gene (Turmel et al., 1991). This enzyme also has a number of cousins, representing probable isoschizomers, that are encoded within introns that are found at the same position in homologous rDNAs (Turmel et al., 1995). I-CeuI displays w15% sequence identity to I-CreI and I-MsoI, and it contains 50 additional residues at its N terminus prior to recognizable homology with the N-terminal sequences of I-CreI and I-MsoI (Figure 2A). Its target site is highly asymmetric, with approximately two-thirds of the bases differing between the left and right half-sites (Figure 2B) (Marshall and Lemieux, 1991). DNA recognition and cleavage by I-CeuI have been characterized by

Figure 2. Sequence Alignment of I-CreI, IMsoI, and I-CeuI Proteins and DNA Targets Sites (A) The overall pairwise sequence identity between the enzymes is shown to the left of the alignment; the secondary structure elements for I-CeuI are shown above the alignment. Residues conserved between all three enzymes are red; those conserved between any two enzymes are blue. The LAGLIDADG motif is outlined; the metal binding acidic residue is indicated with an arrow. The a helices are numbered according to convention, and the helix containing the endonuclease core motif is denoted as ``a1.'' The N-terminal helices that form a unique structural elaboration in I-CeuI are denoted as ``a-2'' and ``a-1.'' Residues in I-CeuI involved in DNA contacts to the major groove base edges and to the phosphate backbone are denoted by black circles; residues involved in additional contacts to base edges in the minor groove are denoted by green circles. The alignment was generated by using CLUSTALW (Thompson et al., 1994). (B) The bases that are conserved between the left and right half-sites of each target are underlined. Bases conserved across all three sites are red; those conserved between any two sites are blue. The cleavage pattern of each enzyme is shown by staggered lines. The overall identity between sites is shown.

using a series of biochemical analyses, leading to the conclusion that its DNA binding affinity, the length of its DNA target site, and its cleavage mechanism are quite similar to those of I-CreI and I-MsoI (Marshall and Lemieux, 1991, 1992; Turmel et al., 1997). In this study, the structure of I-CeuI has been determined in complex with its DNA substrate in order to visualize the extent of its structural diversification relative to I-CreI and I-MsoI and to visualize the structural basis of asymmetric target recognition by a homodimeric DNA binding protein. The relative ability of the enzyme to cleave palindromic sites, derived from half-sites of the physiological homing site, was measured and compared with the asymmetric wild-type target. The extent of structural versus functional divergence provides a benchmark for future modeling efforts of LAGLIDADG enzyme homologs and other DNA modification enzyme systems, such as restriction endonucleases. Results and Discussion The structure of the I-CeuI construct bound to its cognate DNA target site, in which an active site glutamine residue is mutated to arginine (Q93R), was determined by using MAD phasing. Residue Q93 in I-CeuI corresponds to residue Q47 in I-CreI; mutations of this catalytic side chain in I-CeuI have been shown to prevent DNA cleavage (Turmel et al., 1997), and similar mutations in I-CreI have also been shown to prevent DNA cleavage while displaying little effect on DNA binding affinity or the structure of the enzyme-DNA complex (Chevalier et al., 2004). The structure was determined in complex with the asymmetric physiological DNA target site (Figure 2B and Experimental Procedures). The DNA sequence is significantly asymmetric; only four base pairs in each half-site are reflected in the opposing half-site. In all maps used for model building (both initial MAD syntheses and subsequent difference Fouriers), the DNA

was clearly present in a single orientation. The final structure was refined by using data that extended to ° 2.2 A resolution. Divergence of the LAGLIDADG Fold and Active Sites The core topology and fold structure of I-CeuI is similar to that of I-CreI and I-MsoI (Figures 1B, 3, and 4). The rootmean-square difference (rmsd) between the main chain atoms of I-CeuI and I-CreI across the core fold of individ° ual, superimposed subunits is w1.5 A (Figure 3). In complexes in which the enzymes are bound to their respective target sites, the relative orientation of the two DNA binding surfaces differs by w5º, in a plane perpendicular to the axes of the bound DNA (Figure 3A). The difference in orientations between the protein-DNA interfaces originates from differences in the internal packing of each enzyme subunit's core, which affects the packing of the LAGLIDADG helices against the immediately adjacent a helices (a2 and a3 in Figure 2A). This packing change is propagated through the structure, to the DNAcontact surface, resulting in a rigid body rotation of that region in one subunit, relative to its dimeric partner. The homodimeric I-CeuI enzyme, consisting of 218 residue subunits (436 residues in the functional dimer), is the largest free-standing LAGLIDADG enzyme visualized to date (over twice the size of the smallest visualized family member, I-DmoI; see Figure 4) and contains 2 structural elaborations on the core enzyme fold. Both of these regions participate directly in DNA contacts. First, I-CeuI contains a 50 residue N-terminal extension (Figure 2A). These residues form a two-helix amphipathic bundle (Figure 4, top) that adds an extra ``wall'' of basic residues to one side of the DNA-contacting b sheet surface. The first helix in this structural extension is positioned near the DNA backbone. Several side chains from the helix (including K21, N24, and K28) make direct contact with phosphate groups corresponding to bases 6 and 7 (Figure 5).

Figure 3. Superpositions of I-CeuI and I-CreI (A and B) Superposition of I-CeuI is shown in green, and superposition of I-CreI is shown in blue. Superpositions shown from the (A) side and (B) bottom of the enzyme. The LAGLIDADG helices are shown in the same orientations to the right. The rmsd for backbone atoms of individual sub° units is w2 A. The relative orientation of the two DNA-contacting b platforms, calculated from the bottom of the conserved LAGLIDADG helices, differs by w5º (indicated by a black arrow). This difference is caused by a shift in the packing of the LAGLIDADG helix against the corresponding enzyme core in each subunit (indicated by a red arrow for one subunit), rather than by a rigid body rotation of the two subunits. (C) Left: Magnification of the superimposed dimer interfaces of I-CeuI and I-CreI, which contain the conserved residues of their respective active sites. Right: The same orientation with only the I-CeuI interface and active sites shown. Catalytic residues of I-CreI are blue, and those of I-CeuI are colored by element type. A single bound calcium ion in the I-CeuI structure is shown; the corresponding anomalous difference density is shown in the right panel. The calcium is bound between the scissile phosphates and the corresponding metal binding residues. The Q93 residue of I-CeuI is modeled from the crystal structure of the Q93R mutant used to solve its structure.

In addition to the N-terminal extension found in I-CeuI, the enzyme also displays an extended loop connecting the final two helices in the structure (a5 and a6). This loop, which includes a 6 residue insertion unique to the I-CeuI lineage (Figure 2A), reaches around the bound DNA and makes additional contacts to base pairs +/23 and 4 within the minor groove. The enzyme forms relatively few contacts to these base pairs in the major groove, instead concentrating such contacts to base pairs +/25, 6, and 7. In contrast, I-CreI and I-MsoI establish DNA contacts and their corresponding binding

specificity solely through contacts to DNA bases within their major grooves and concentrate those contacts to base pairs 3, 4, and 5. As a result of the differences in contact motifs and patterns between I-CeuI and I-Cre/ I-Mso, we would predict that the specificity profile displayed by these enzymes should differ significantly, perhaps contributing to the ability of I-CeuI to recognize a highly asymmetric target (discussed further below). The active sites of I-CeuI, I-CreI, and I-MsoI are their most strongly conserved features (Figure 3C). A pair of acidic residues (D20 and 200 in I-CreI; E66 and 660 in

I-CeuI Structure and Asymmetric DNA Cleavage 873

active sites of the broader LAGLIDADG family are highly divergent, with a variety of polar residues diversely arranged around a pocket that positions several wellordered water molecules (Chevalier et al., 2004). Within I-CreI, the active site residues are Q47, K98, and R51. The glutamine is involved in metal binding (via contact with metal bound water), the lysine may assist in phosphoanion stabilization, and the arginine contacts the cleaved 50 phosphate. These residues are partially recapitulated in the I-CeuI active site: Q47 is directly conserved as Q93 (mutated to an arginine in this structure), and K98 is replaced with K153 from a neighboring b strand. However, a direct homolog of R51 is not found in I-CeuI; the closest residue is H94 (which is strictly conserved in the I-CeuI lineage). Therefore, 2 residues between the I-CeuI and I-CreI active sites are conserved in both sequence and structure (E66/D20 and Q93/ Q47); one residue has been replaced in the primary sequence while being conserved in the 3D structure (K153/K98), and one has been altogether replaced (H94/R51). The catalytic mechanism of the I-CreI and I-MsoI enzymes has been postulated to follow a typical two-metal hydrolysis mechanism, with the unique feature that the two active sites bind a total of three metal ions, such that one metal is shared between the two scissile phosphates and the LAGLIDADG aspartate residues of the otherwise independent active sites (Chevalier et al., 2001, 2004). However, in I-CreI, this shared metal ion has only been unambiguously visualized in a product complex, leaving open the possibility that it is bound only after completion of DNA cleavage. In the structure of I-CeuI, the mutation of Q93 to an arginine prevents DNA cleavage. In the resulting structure, a single bound metal ion (calcium) is observed in the active site and is bound at the shared position between the active sites and scissile phosphates (Figure 3C, right panel). The ``peripheral'' metal ion sites (which are coordinated in I-CreI by Q47, the homolog of Q93) are occupied by water molecules. DNA Recognition Like other LAGLIDADG enzymes visualized in complex with their DNA targets (I-CreI, I-MsoI, I-SceI, I-AniI, and PI-SceI) (Bolduc et al., 2003; Chevalier et al., 2003; Jurica et al., 1998; Moure et al., 2003; Sui et al., 2002), I-CeuI displays a limited set of contacts to individual hydrogen bond partners on the nucleotide bases and phosphate backbone (Figure 5). Of the 66 potential hydrogen bond donors and acceptors distributed throughout the major groove of the DNA target, 16 are observed to be engaged by either direct contacts to enzyme side chains (10 total contacts) or via water-mediated bridging contacts to additional side chains (6 additional contacts). Four additional hydrogen bond contacts are made to individual bases in the minor groove; again, these contacts are divided between direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds. The contacts to individual base pairs are largely concentrated at positions +/23­7 in each half-site. In addition to sparse sampling of the sequence-dependent DNA hydrogen bond network, a T:A base pair that is palindromically conserved at positions +/210 in each half-site is engaged in a hydrophobic van der Waals contact with a side chain methyl group

Figure 4. Structural Divergence and Elaboration across the LAGLIDADG Enzyme Family The endonucleases are arranged from the largest enzyme on top (I-CeuI, a homodimer with two 218 residue subunits; or 436 residues total) to the smallest enzyme on the bottom (I-DmoI, a free-standing monomeric enzyme containing 188 residues). I-CeuI displays two significant elaborations on the core LAGLIDADG fold that increase the total contact area to the DNA target: an N-terminal bundle of two a helices that provide nonspecific polar contacts to the DNA backbone (red arrows; also see Figure 2A), and an extended loop (denoted by blue arrows) between a helices 5 and 6 that provides contacts within the minor groove to bases +/23 and 4 in each half-site.

Unambiguous noncovalent contacts to individual bases are shown below. The scissile phosphate groups are red. Base pairs that are conserved between the left and right half-sites, and enzyme residues that are engaged in identical contacts to bases in each half-site, are shaded. Structured water molecules involved in contacts between the DNA target and the enzyme are indicated with circles; the single observed bound metal ion (calcium) is indicated by a circled ``M.'' This single metal ion is indicated twice in the figure, and it is shared between the scissile phosphates and the enzyme active sites. Residue 93, which is a conserved glutamine in the wild-type enzyme, is present in the structure as a catalytically inactivating arginine (Q93R); this side chain is in contact with the phosphate in each half-site directly 50 to the scissile phosphate. In structures of I-CreI and I-MsoI, the wild-type glutamine residue participates in coordination of a metal bound water molecule. (B) Ribbon diagram of the b sheet DNA binding platform and additional elaborations (a-2 and loop 5/6) from I-CeuI; residues participating in DNAcontacts are shown and labeled.

of leucine 76 of the two enzyme subunits. Finally, 18 phosphate groups are engaged in direct polar contacts with basic and hydrophilic side chains and the enzyme backbone. As has been observed previously for other LAGLIDADG enzyme-DNA complexes, w25% of potential contact positions along the DNA target are engaged by the protein in its cognate complex.

The distribution of contacts in the I-CeuI structure correlates well with previous mutational studies of its target site (Marshall and Lemieux, 1992). The enzyme most specifically recognizes the identity of the central 14 base pairs of the target site, while tolerating a small number of substitutions across that region. Interestingly, the specificity of base recognition measured in

Conservation of Residues in the I-CeuI Lineage of Homodimeric Endonucleases and Correlation of DNA-Contacting and Active Site Residues with Mutational Inactivation Data This figure is modified from Figure 4 of Turmel et al. (1997). The amino acid sequences of nine homing endonucleases that are all encoded within group 1 introns at site 1923 in algal LSU rDNA genes are aligned; residues conserved in this lineage are denoted with white-on-black characters. The sequence of I-CreI (from the lineage found in intron insertion site 2593) is shown below for comparison. Positions of residues involved in DNA recognition contacts are indicated with black spheres; positions of catalytically critical residues in the active site are indicated with arrows and labels (the active site residues of I-CreI are shown with gray arrows and labels below the alignment). Positions of residues that were found to be correlated with reduction or loss of endonuclease function, when substituted in a randomized point mutagenesis screen, are indicated with orange circles.

that study appeared to be significantly different at base pairs +/25, which are not conserved between the left and right DNA half-sites. The C:G base pair in the left half-site is refractory to substitution, whereas the corresponding T:A base pair in the right half-site can be freely substituted with modest losses of cleavage activity. This result correlates with the contacts made to each base pair (Figure 5A): the atoms of the G:C at position 25 are engaged in multiple contacts to enzyme side chains, whereas the corresponding T:A at position +5 is devoid of such contacts. The difference in contacts and in specificity in the two DNA half-sites demonstrates that recognition of individual base pairs is dependent on the context of neighboring DNA sequence, which can alter the participation of nearby side chains in forming proteinDNA contacts. The effect of random amino acid substutions in I-CeuI (Turmel et al., 1997) as well as a comparative sequence alignment to its closest relatives (Figure 6) indicate that (1) the enzyme displays a wide range of sensitivities to mutations of individual DNA-contacting residues, and that (2) many of those same residues have diverged significantly within the I-CeuI endonuclease branch. Out of 23 residues in each subunit that are unambiguously involved in DNA contacts, only 7 are strictly conserved in the closest I-CeuI homologs (endonucleases that are assumed to share very similar site recognition

properties). The 7 contacting residues that are conserved in this alignment (S68, R74, D86, T92, K116, N120, and T122) are either in close physical proximity to active site residues and the scissile phosphates or make contacts to palindromically conserved base pairs. Six of these seven conserved DNA contact positions were identified as important for endonuclease activity in a screen for enzyme point mutants with reduced cleavage activity. In contrast, those contact residues that are farther removed from the active sites appear more tolerant toward mutation and likewise are more diverged among enzyme homologs. This same mutagenesis screen correctly identified all 4 residues (E66, Q93, H94, and K153) that appear to play important roles in the active site and a small number of structural residues (many in the LAGLIDADG helices) that are also intolerant to mutation. Symmetry Recognizing Asymmetry A particularly unique feature of DNA recognition by the I-CeuI endonuclease is that this homodimeric enzyme's target site from C. eugametos is extremely asymmetric (Figure 2B), with only 4 out of 11 base pairs in the left half-site conserved in the right half-site. Previous studies indicated that the progress of the endonuclease reaction is itself asymmetric, with the top strand cleaved more rapidly than the bottom (Marshall and Lemieux,

Asymmetric DNA Binding and Cleavage by I-CeuI (A) Cleavage of the wild-type I-CeuI target (site 1923 from C. eugametos LSU rDNA) and of two palindromic variants corresponding to inverted repeats of the left DNA half-site (base pairs 21 to 211) and the right DNA half-site (base pairs +1 to +11), respectively. The progression of the reaction, and the DNA bend parameters for the bound wild-type site, are shown to the right. (B) Superposition of the individual I-CeuI subunits and the b sheet DNA binding platforms from their bound complex with the corresponding individual DNA target half-sites. The protein and/or DNA from the ``left'' half-site (bases 21 to 211 in Figure 5A) are green; the corresponding struc° ° ture of the ``right'' half-site is blue. The rmsd of all backbone atoms is less than 1.0 A; the rmsd of side chain atoms in the DNA interface is w1.7 A. Accommodation of differences in DNA base pair recognition by the two subunits, leading to binding and cleavage of the asymmetric target site, is almost entirely facilitated by small variations in side chain rotameric conformations and the position and use of bound intermediate solvent molecules (the latter feature is schematized in Figure 4A).

1992). The enzyme, as expected for a homodimeric protein, is capable of binding and cleaving palindromic variants of this site, which are composed of inverted repeats of the left or right half-sites (Figure 7A). These preferences are also markedly asymmetric, with cleavage of the right-right palindrome being much more efficient than corresponding cleavage of the left-left palindrome. However, both palindromic targets are cleaved less efficiently than the physiological, asymmetric target site. This result is also observed in the presence of manganese, in which the enzyme is less active overall (results not shown). A possible explanation for this observation is that bending of the DNA target prior to cleavage introduces physical strain near the center of the site that is more easily tolerated in the context of the central base pair sequence of the wild-type nonpalindromic target (50 -CCTAAG-30 ) than for either of the palindromic variants of that target (50 -CCTAGG-30 and 50 -CTTAAG-30 , respectively). An analysis of the DNA conformation in the bound complex involves significant asymmetric unrolling and unstacking (leading to a large negative roll angle and a correlated positive base pair twist) at the middle of the site (Figure 7A). The ability of a homodimeric enzyme such as I-CeuI to preferentially cleave a highly asymmetric DNA target, as well as both palindromic constructs constructed of individual halfsites (and presumably, many additional targets that are intermediates between these sequences), probably correlates with an elevated level of recognition promiscuity (i.e., relaxed fidelity) that may, in turn, correlate with greater ability to undergo horizontal transfer between highly divergent hosts. The structural basis of asymmetric DNA target recognition by I-CeuI is visualized directly in this study by virtue of the fact that the DNA in the crystal lattice is bound in a single unique orientation. DNA sequence differences between the two half-sites are accommodated entirely by changes in side chain rotameric torsion angles and the variable use of bridging water molecules (Figures 7B­7D). For example, positions 28 and 29 in the left half-site are two consecutive A:T base pairs, whereas the equivalent positions +8 and +9 in the right half-site are a G:C and a C:G, respectively (Figure 5A). These positions in the two half-sites are both bound in close proximity to residues D86 and 860 , respectively (Figure 7D, left panel). In the left half-site, the N3 nitrogen atoms of the adenine bases display water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the two carboxylate oxygens of the acidic D86 side chain. In contrast, this same residue in the right half-site makes a single water-mediated contact to the extracyclic oxygen of guanine +8, facilitated by a 90º rotation of the aspartate side chain around its chi-2 torsion angle. A similar rearrangement of bonded contacts is observed at base pairs +/25 and 6, where two consecutive C:G base pairs in the left half-site are changed to a T:A and A:T in the right half-site (Figure 7D, right panel). The carboxylate oxygens of the Glu88 side chain in the left half-site contact the extracyclic N4 nitrogens of the adjacent cytosine bases, whereas, in the

right half-site, the same side chain is shifted through a 20º rotation of chi-1 and forms a single water-mediated contact to the extracyclic nitrogen of adenine +6. In addition, R114 shifts slightly to make a van der Waals contact to the methyl group of thymine +6. The recognition of asymmetric DNA targets by homodimeric DNA binding proteins has been observed before, although not for sites longer than 12 base pairs, and generally not for symmetric palindromy of less than 67% (corresponding to 2 out of 3 base pairs identical between the DNA half-sites). For example, bHLH transcription factors such as Deadpan (Dpn) and sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) bind to asymmetric variants of palindromic E-box sequences (50 -CANNTG-30 ), in which symmetry is broken at one base pair for Dpn (50 -CACGCG-30 ) or at multiple positions for the SREBPs (50 -ATCACCCAC-30 ). Biochemical analyses of Dpn binding (Winston et al., 2000) and a cocrystal structure of SREBP-1a (Parraga et al., 1998) both indicate that these proteins accommodate asymmetric target recognition through alternate side chain contact patterns. Crystallographic studies of homodimeric transcription factors bound to asymmetric DNA sequences (the tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein TonEBP [Stroud et al., 2002] and the NF-kB family member p65-RelA [Chen et al., 2000]) also demonstrate the generation of unique hydrogen bonding patterns to nonconserved base pairs. In contrast, the HAP1 transcription factor, a homodimer with a Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster domain, binds to a tandem repeat DNA sequence (rather than to a symmetric, inverted palindromic repeat) by completely breaking homodimeric symmetry and the subsequent arrangement of the DNA binding zinc domains into a head-to-tail configuration through the use of a flexible linker region (King et al., 1999). Conclusions: Asymmetry from Symmetry in Nature and in Engineering It is believed that monomeric LAGLIDADG endonucleases, which contain two enzyme domains arranged in a single ORF as a tandem repeat, connected by a linker region, have arisen as a result of gene duplication events from homodimeric ancestors. The descendents of the progeny of such events would have a significant advantage over homodimeric enzymes, in that they are no longer constrained to maintain recognition specificities that correspond to symmetric DNA target sites, and therefore should exhibit enhanced genetic mobility. The fact that most, if not all, of the known homodimeric enzymes in this family can cleave pseudopalindromic targets, and that some of these enzymes, such as I-CeuI, are already capable of recognizing sites with extreme asymmetry (in this case, actually preferring the asymmetric target), implies that the immediate products of gene duplications might sometimes be capable of significant activity toward novel sites that are already almost entirely nonpalindromic. In other words, the homing endonuclease ORFS that encode small homodimer subunits may often be poised for subsequent divergence toward novel

asymmetric targets, as a result of initial gene duplication and fusion events. The exceedingly flexible use of multiple side chain and solvent contact patterns to DNA, by conserved protein backbone scaffolds, facilitates this feature of asymmetric and degenerate specificity, and it clearly accelerates the evolution and divergence of the enzyme family. LAGLIDADG homing endonucleases are under intense scrutiny as potential tools for targeted genetic applications, ranging from therapeutic applications (Wickelgren, 2003) to population engineering (Burt, 2003). The aim of such studies is to create enzyme variants that act at DNA sequences corresponding to physiological target sites. Currently, efforts rely on methods to generate combinatorial enzyme variant libraries (Arnould et al., 2006; Chames et al., 2005; Gruen et al., 2002; Seligman et al., 2002; Sussman et al., 2004). Such libraries are appropriate for the saturating randomization of limited positions within an enzyme scaffold. However, a comparison of I-CreI and I-MsoI (which recognize almost identical sites, but are only 38% identical) and I-CeuI (which recognizes a cognate site that is 50% identical to the Cre/Mso targets[s], but are only 15% identical to those enzymes) raises the possibility that complete specificity changes for an individual enzyme may be difficult to achieve. However, experiments have also indicated that the highly modular organization of these enzymes facilitates structural ``grafting'' between enzymes that might be useful for efficiently altering DNA cleavage specificity (Chevalier et al., 2002; Epinat et al., 2003; Steuer et al., 2004). The rapid pace at which branches of LAGLIDADG homologs are being discovered also promises to greatly aid in the ongoing efforts to harness homing endonucleases for targeted applications.
Experimental Procedures The amplification and sequencing of regions spanning chloroplast large subunit (LSU) rDNA from various green algae, and their intron insertion sites (including those corresponding to I-CreI, I-MsoI and ICeuI), has been previously described (Lemieux et al., 1988; Turmel

et al., 1995, 1997). Briefly, the strains were grown in modified Volvox medium or medium K. The PCR amplifications were performed from total cellular DNA or chloroplast DNA-enriched preparations. The PCR products were sequenced by using the dsDNA cycle sequencing system from Life Technologies Inc./BRL (Canada). The multiple protein sequence alignment shown in Figure 2 was generated with CLUSTALW (Thompson et al., 1994). I-CeuI Expression and Purification The gene encoding the I-CeuI endonuclease was PCR amplified and subcloned into the T7 promoter expression plasmid pET-30a(+) (Novagen) as previously described (Turmel et al., 1997). The expression plasmid encoding the Q93R variant of I-CeuI was transformed into BL21 (DE3(RIL)) E. coli cells for protein overexpression. Large-scale liquid cultures were grown to mid-log phase (OD600 of 0.5­0.8), and protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropylthio-b-D-galactosidase (IPTG). The cells were then incubated for an additional 3 hr at 37ºC for protein overexpression. The histidinetagged I-CeuI was purified by using TALON metal affinity resin (BD Biosciences Clonetech), and after protein concentration, the histidine tag was proteolytically cleaved by using a recombinant enterokinase kit (Novagen). The purified protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0). I-CeuI Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination The DNA construct used for crystallization purposes consisted of a top strand containing sequence 50 -acgataacggtcctaaggtagcgaa gc-30 and a complementary strand of sequence 50 -tgcttcgctaccttag gaccgttatcg-30 . The duplex formed by these strands contains 26 base pairs, with a single 50 base overhang at the end of each strand (A and T, respectively). The target sequence of I-CeuI (50 -ataacggtcc taaggtagcgaa-30 ) is centered in the resulting duplex. The protein concentration in the initial crystallization drops was 10 mg/ml, and the DNA was added to a final stoichiometric excess over the protein of 1.1:1.0. Cocrystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion in 26%­ 36% (v:v) PEG 400, 100 mM Tris (pH 8.1­8.7), 100 mM KCl, and 10 mM CaCl2. Crystals were looped and frozen in liquid nitrogen directly from the drop. The space group and unit cell dimensions ° from the I-CeuI/DNA cocrystals are P212121 and a = 50.0 A, b = ° ° 68.4 A, c = 168.7 A, a = 90º, b = 90º, and g = 90º, respectively. The ° native data set was collected to 2.2 A resolution. Phasing was performed by using selenomethionine replacement methods (Doublie, 1997). Isoleucines 23 and 182 were mutated to methionine based on a sequence alignment of I-CeuI with homologous proteins.

I-CeuI Structure and Asymmetric DNA Cleavage 879

Selenomethionine-substituted I-CeuI/DNA cocrystals were grown under similar conditions to the native crystals. A three wavelength MAD data set was collected at beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light ° Source (Berkeley, CA) to 2.8 A resolution. All six selenium atoms were located, and interpretable electron density was observed for the entire complex. There is one protein dimer/DNA complex in the asymmetric unit. Initial models were built into the electron density maps calculated from the MAD data set and subsequently used for molecular replacement into the high-resolution data set of the single mutant (Q93R) protein. The structure was refined to an Rcryst and Rfree of 21.9 and 23.1, respectively. Data collection and refinement statistics are in Table 1. Model building was performed with XtalView (McRee, 1999) and O (Jones et al., 1991). Refinement was performed with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) and CCP4 (CCP4, 1979). The stereochemistry of the model was monitored with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). I-CeuI Target Site Cleavage Assays Oligonucleotides for wild-type, palindrome left (PL), and palindrome right (PR) sequences, as well as their respective bottom strands, were synthesized by Operon Biotechnologies Inc. The oligos included additional flanking regions to aid in annealing and cloning by decreasing the overall palindromy and to provide the proper overhang for ligation. The sequences for WT, PL, and PR top and bottom strands are as follows (the recognition sequence is in italics): 50 AATTCgggttgataacggtcctaaggtagcgaagggtccatatccggtcC-30 (WT top), 50 -TCGAGgaccggatatggacccttcgctaccttaggaccgttatcaacccG30 (WT bottom); 50 -AATTCgggttgataacggtcctaggaccgttatgggtccat atccggtgC-30 (PL top), 50 -TCGAGcaccggatatggacccataacggtcctagg accgttatcaacccG-30 (PL bottom); 50 -AATTCgggttgttcgctaccttaaggta gcgaagggtccatatccggtgC-30 (PR top), 50 -TCGAGcaccggatatggaccc ttcgctaccttaaggtagcgaacaacccG-30 (PR bottom). Oligos were resuspended in water to a final concentration of 100 mM. Equal volumes of appropriate oligos were mixed and heated to 95ºC for 5 min. Samples were then slowly cooled to 22º over 1 hr. Annealed oligos were diluted in water to a final concentration of 50 nM and were ligated into a pBS II vector predigested with EcoRI and XhoI. Individual clones were miniprepped and sequence verified. A total of 600 ng WT-, PL-, or PR-containing plasmids was digested with 2.5 U I-CeuI purchased from New England Biolabs (NEB). One unit is described by NEB as the amount of protein necessary to cleave 1 mg linearized plasmid DNA (3.5 kb in length). Sequential 100 ng aliquots from these reactions were quenched at 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min by adding SDS to 0.5% w/v while heating to 65º for 20 min. An additional digestion of PL was done with 5 U enzyme to demonstrate cleavage of that substrate.
