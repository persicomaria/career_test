Cytochrome b5 in solution has two isomers (A and B) differing by a 1808 rotation of the protoporphyrin IX plane around the axis defined by the a and g meso protons. Homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy has been employed in order to solve the solution structure of the minor (B) form of the oxidized state of the protein and to probe its backbone dynamics in the ms±ms timescale in both oxidation states. A family of 40 conformers has been obtained using 1302 meaningful NOEs and 220 pseudocontact shifts and is characterized by high quality and good resolution (rmsd to the mean structure of 0.055 ^ 0.009 nm and 0.103 ^ 0.011 nm for backbone and heavy atoms, respectively). Extensive comparisons of the structural and dynamics changes associated with the A-to-B form interconversion for both oxidation states were subsequently performed. Propionate 6 experiences a redox-statedependent reorientation as does propionate 7 in the A form. Significant insights are obtained into the role of the protein frame for efficient biological function and backbone mobility is proposed to be one of the factors that could control the reduction potential of the heme. Keywords: backbone dynamics; cytochrome b5; oxidized B form; solution structure.

Cytochrome b5 is ubiquitous in living organisms and is involved in a wide variety of electron-transfer reactions [1±5]. Its hydrophilic domain, still retaining full activity (hereafter cyt b5), can easily be isolated [6,7] or expressed in Escherichia coli [8]. Among cytochromes, b-types have the peculiarity that the heme moiety is not covalently bound to the protein matrix, but is connected to it through two coordination bonds between the iron ion and two histidine residues [9]. Two isomers of cyt b5 have been identified which differ by a rotation of the heme plane of 1808 around the meso a and g protons [10] (reported schematically in Fig. 1), usually indicated as the A (major) and B (minor) forms [11,12]. X-ray crystal structures of the A form of cyt b5 from different sources are available [13,14], while no crystal structure of the B form of cyt b5 has been reported to date. For rat microsomal cyt b5 the relative population of the two forms is 6 : 4 (A : B) and both forms are well resolved through NMR spectroscopy. Recently, the solution structure of the A form (hereafter, cyt b5 Ared or Aox) has been obtained independently for both the reduced (diamagnetic) [15,16] and oxidized (paramagnetic) [17] states of the iron. The solution structure of the reduced B form (hereafter, cyt b5 Bred) has also appeared recently [16].

In this paper, we report the solution structure of the B form of the oxidized and paramagnetic rat microsomal cyt b5 (hereafter, cyt b5 Box) and the backbone dynamics of cyt b5 Box and Bred in the ms±ms timescale as monitored through heteronuclear (15N) rotating-frame NMR-relaxation experiments. By undertaking a detailed comparison of the available solution structures and backbone mobilities of the A and B forms in both oxidation states, we can present a complete report on the structural changes associated with A-to-B interconversion and on the role of the protein matrix for efficient function independent of the heme orientation. The question of the different reduction potential of the heme in the two forms [18,19] is also addressed. MATER I A L S A N D METH O D S The sample, NMR data (obtained on a Bruker Avance 800 NMR spectrometer, operating at a Larmor frequency of 800.13 MHz), calibration of distance constraints from NOESY volumes and structure calculation protocol were, deliberately, maintained exactly the same as for cyt b5 Aox [17]. A three-dimensional NOESY±heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiment (800 MHz) was acquired to better resolve some overlapping connectivities. Calibration of cross-peak intensity was performed using the program caliba [20]. In order to ensure equivalent calibration for all cross-peaks (degenerate and nondegenerate) their intensities were normalized by knowing that the ratio A : B is 6 : 4. Pseudocontact shifts were also used as constraints to calculate the structure through the pseudyana [21] and pseudorem [22] protocols as already performed for cyt b5 Aox. The diamagnetic chemical shifts needed as references were taken from the literature [15,23]. Nitrogen rotating-frame relaxation experiments were performed on the oxidized and reduced states of cyt b5 B, at a

magnetic field of 14.1 T on a 15N-labeled sample, as a function of the effective magnetic-field amplitude, in order to identify local motions in the ms±ms timescale. Some applications of this heteronuclear NMR method to probe protein-backbone mobility in an intermediate time range (ms±ms) have appeared recently [24±28]. The sample preparation, experimental protocol and data analysis were again, deliberately, maintained analogous to the case of cyt b5 Aox [29] in order to allow a meaningful comparison between the two forms (A, B) and the two oxidation states. As discussed in detail in Banci et al. [29], the experimentally measured relaxation rate, R1rOFF, can be corrected to account for the angular dispersion of the 15N resonances, to obtain R1rOFF,cor. This is measured as a function

of the effective magnetic-field amplitude (veff). If a backbone N nucleus is involved in a conformational-exchange process in the ms to ms timescale, then R1rOFF,cor displays a Lorentziantype dependence on veff and, after fitting, a correlation time (tex) associated with this process can be estimated.

R E S U LT S Sequence-specific assignment The A and B forms of oxidized cyt b5 are in slow exchange with each other, resulting in the splitting of most resonances. The assignment of the hyperfine-shifted proton signals [30,31] and of many signals in the diamagnetic envelope [32,33] has already been reported. A few more protons were identified and are available as supplementary material. The residues for which the two forms can be separately identified increases from 45% as reported previously [33] to 60% in the present study, basically because of the increased resolution provided by the 800-MHz NMR magnet. In summary, the assignment was extended to 95% of the residues and 75% of the protons. This result is analogous with that obtained in the case of cyt b5 Aox [17]. Structure calculations and description of the structure Structure calculations were carried out using 1302 meaningful upper distance limits from a total of 1765 cross-peaks and 220 pseudocontact shifts. (The number of meaningful NOE constraints in the previously reported structures were as follows: 1208 and 1203 for Ared in Dangi et al. [16] and Banci et al. [15], respectively, 1152 for Bred in Dangi et al. [16], 1372 together with 235 pseudocontact shifts for Aox in Arnesano et al. [17].) The program pseudyana [21] provided a family of 40 conformers [40] with average rmsd values to the mean structure of 0.056 ^ 0.009 nm and 0.105 ^ 0.012 nm for the backbone and for all heavy atoms, respectively, and a target function between 0.0023 and 0.0047 nm2 (average of 0.0038 ^ 0.0006 nm2).

Each member of the pseudyana family was then subjected to restrained energy minimization by including distance and pseudocontact shift constraints with the pcshift module of the Amber program package [22]. The resulting family of structures (Fig. 2), used in the analysis, has average rmsd values to the mean structure of 0.055 ^ 0.009 nm and 0.103 ^ 0.011 nm for backbone and for heavy atoms, respectively, and a penalty function between 20.8 and 43.7 kJ´mol ±1 (average 32.1 ^ 5.4 kJ´mol ±1). The contribution of the pseudocontact shift constraints to the penalty function is ,6%. The energyminimized average structure of the family has a penalty function of 26.2 kJ´mol ±1. Statistical analysis of the quality of the energy-minimized structure is available as supplementary material in the form of a table. The quality of the structure is equivalent to that of cyt b5 Aox, as shown in the same table. Overall, the solution structure is well resolved, including the regions near the paramagnetic center, because of the high number of constraints employed and their type (i.e. proton±proton distance constraints deriving from NOEs and proton±metal distance and angular constraints deriving from pseudocontact shifts). The iron ion lies on the heme plane as

determined by the pseudocontact shift constraints. The values of rmsd per residue for the backbone and all heavy atoms are very similar to those for cyt b5 Aox [17] and are shown in Fig. 3. The tertiary fold is that typical of cytochromes b5. Four helices, separated by the heme-binding histidines, together with a b-sheet, form the heme-binding pocket; two additional helices are present in the structure. As evaluated through PROCHECK±NMR [34] analysis, the four helices forming the heme-binding pocket span residues 33±39 (a2), 42±50 (a3), 54±62 (a4) and 66±74 (a5). The more peripheral helices span residues 8±14 (a1) and 81±87 (a6). Two antiparallel b-strands are found at 21±25, 28±32 and a third, antiparallel to the latter, is found at position 75±77. These secondary structural elements are very similar to those found in cyt b5 Aox [17], and cyt b5 Ared [15,16] and Bred [16]. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is characterized by the parameters Dx ax = (2.73 ^ 0.02) £ 10 ± 32 m3 and Dx rh = (1.04 ^ 0.01) £ 10 ± 32 m3. The z-axis makes an angle of 4.58 with the perpendicular to the heme plane and the x-axis an angle of 18.58 with the a±g meso axis. These values are very close to those obtained for cyt b5 Aox [17], concluding that the magnetic susceptibility tensor is very similar in the two forms. Structural comparison of cyt b5 Box with cyt b5 Aox The solution structures of rat microsomal cyt b5 Box and cyt b5 Aox [17] were obtained under the same experimental conditions and using the same calculation protocol. The resulting structures were both of high quality and equivalent good resolution thus allowing us to make a meaningful comparison. The comparison is performed by superimposing only three residues at a time (locally) or the whole structure at once (globally). The ribbon diagrams of the average minimized structures of the two forms are shown in Fig. 4, together with a stereoview of the superimposed structures. The local rmsd values between the two average structures are always within the rmsd of each family of structures. On the contrary, from inspection of the global rmsd values, larger parts of the protein appear not to be superimposable. These are composed by residues 12, 23±25, 28±32, 41±49, 53±55, 57±64, 68±69 and 75±76. It seems that isolated local conformational changes are capable of sliding whole elements of secondary structure resulting in a not-perfect superimposition of the two structures. The residues in van der Waals contacts with the heme, besides the two iron binding histidines, are Val23, Leu25,

Leu32, Phe35, Pro40, Val45, Leu46, Ala54, Phe58, Val 61, Ala67, Ser71 and Tyr74 (Fig. 1). Most of these, or residues very close to them, assume a slightly different conformation or position in the protein frame with respect to cyt b5 Aox. For example, residues Val23, Leu25 and Leu32 show a displacement in the protein frame to accommodate the main structural variation induced by the heme rotation. In particular, Val23 and Leu25 move slightly further away from the heme, while Leu32 moves closer to it in the B form occupying the space left by methyl 3 which replaces vinyl 2 present in the A form. The observed structural variations are confirmed by changes in several medium- and long-range NOEs. By examining the four a-helices forming the heme-binding pocket, we notice that all residues belonging to them, and that are in van der Waals contact with the heme, are also subject to small local displacements (moving either away from or closer to the heme skeleton) in order to accommodate the effect of `pseudomutation' (methyl-to-vinyl interchange) caused by the heme rotation. Structural comparison of cyt b5 Box with cyt b5 Bred The solution structure of the B form of reduced cyt b5 (cyt b5 Bred) has recently appeared [16]. The sample conditions were the same as in the present case, and a quite large number of experimental constraints was employed (1152 distance constraints) allowing us to perform a comparison between Ê the two structures. An overall rmsd value of 1.38 A , obtained by superimposing cyt b5 Box and Bred, indicates that the result for the two structures is quite similar. Larger local differences are obtained for the following residues: 34±35, 37±38 (helix a2), 55, 60 (helix a4) and 64±69 (helix a5). These are small conformational changes that contribute to a small opening of the heme cleft in cyt b5 Bred. A similar, slightly more open, heme cleft has been observed for cyt b5 Ared relative to Aox [17]. In this case, the conformation of propionate groups, which is an important feature in cytochromes (see Discussion), is better characterized by inspection of the available NOEs rather than by just looking at the average structures, since these groups are highly solvent exposed. The NOE constraints involving the propionate groups are reported in Table 1. The interresidue NOEs observed for propionate 6 in our structure are of the same type and number as those observed for propionate 7 in cyt b5 Aox [17] and vice versa. This indicates that, as a result of heme rotation, the two propionates interchange their roles. The same

also holds for the reduced forms, where however, the propionate groups are characterized by a smaller number of interresidue NOEs ([15] and unpublished data) resulting in larger structural disorder. Therefore, while in the A form propionate 7 undergoes a conformational change upon oxidation, it is propionate 6 that does it in the B form. Backbone dynamics of cyt b5 Box in the ms±ms timescale The R1rOFF [27,29] relaxation rates of 67 backbone nitrogens (34 of those unique for cyt b5 Box) could be integrated precisely, as they were not overlapping with other signals, and were then corrected for the variation in angle u, in order to obtain the R1rOFF,cor [27,29] rates. The dependence of the latter on veff was subsequently examined. Thirty-seven of these rates were found to be independent of the effective magnetic-field amplitude. Of those, 31 (nine unique for cyt b5 Box) show overall

a quite uniform behavior with an average value of R1rOFF,cor = 6.9 ^ 0.9 Hz. The six that remain (three unique for cyt b5 Box), correspond to the backbone nitrogens of residues 27, 31, 44, 54, 72 and 80, and display R1rOFF,cor rates 50±150% larger than the former 31. As discussed analytically in Banci et al. [27,29], the above relaxation behavior can be interpreted as follows: for the 31 residues with a uniform relaxation rate R1rOFF,cor = 6.9 ^ 0.9 Hz, one can conclude either the absence of a slow motion (t ex = 0) or that the chemical shift difference, dV, associated with the conformational exchange process we are interested in detecting is not large enough to sizably contribute to rotatingframe relaxation (R1r). The behavior observed for the remaining six residues is an indication of the presence of a conformational exchange process, whose timescale is faster than the one accessible with the available veff. Consequently, only an upper limit of 40 ms can be set for the correlation time, t ex, of these processes. The R1rOFF,cor values for the remaining 30 nitrogen backbone amides (22 unique for cyt b5 Box) displayed a monotone increase with decreasing veff. They correspond to residues: 5, 9, 10, 22, 24, 26, 30, 33, 34, 36, 39, 45±50, 52, 55, 57±60, 67, 69, 73±75, 79 and 84. This relaxation behavior, provides direct experimental evidence for the presence of conformationalexchange processes for these residues. Their correlation times, t ex, can be obtained by performing a fit of the experimental data to a Lorentzian-type curve (eqn 3 in [29]). This fit was already available for residues with a degenerate 15N resonance for the A and B forms (5, 9, 10, 22, 46, 59, 79 and 84) while for the remaining 22 (possessing a unique resonance for cyt b5 Box) it was successfully performed in the current study. The fitting procedure was equivalent to that described recently for cyt b5 Aox [29]. The only difference relative to Banci et al. [29] is that the lower limit of the average R1rOFF,cor is 6.0 Hz in the present case (5.9 Hz in Banci et al. [29]) and this is the value used as fixed in the fits. The values estimated for t ex for the 22 nondegenerate backbone nitrogens on cyt b5 Box were in the same time range within experimental error as those reported for cyt b5 Aox [29]. A representative fit is shown in Fig. 5. It corresponds to the backbone nitrogen of Thr55 and was chosen first because this is a nondegenerate resonance, and secondly because the 15N of Thr55 is one of the eight backbone nitrogens that display a conformational exchange process in cyt b5 Box but not in cyt b5 Aox (see Discussion). In total, 36 backbone nitrogens in rat microsomal cyt b5 Box were identified as participating in conformational-exchange processes in the ms±ms timescale. This corresponds to a 30% increase in local mobility in the ms±ms timescale with respect to cyt b5 Aox, where 28 such nitrogens were identified. The results for all 36 residues are reported in Table 2 together with those obtained for cyt b5 Aox [29] for comparison purposes (see Discussion). Backbone dynamics of cyt b5 Bred in the ms-ms timescale A similar analysis to the one described above was performed for 66 backbone nitrogens (of which 27 were nondegenerate) of cyt b5 Bred. The results of the analysis are also reported in Table 2, together with those obtained recently for cyt b5 Ared [29]. In summary, a total of 13 backbone nitrogens was identified as participating in conformational-exchange processes in rat microsomal cyt b5 Bred. Taking into account that 12 such nitrogens were identified in cyt b5 Ared [29], we can conclude that overall there was no significant increase in local mobility in the ms±ms timescale for the reduced form of cyt b5 upon change of the heme orientation.

DISCUSSION Upon A-to-B heme reorientation in oxidized rat microsomal cyt b5, the structural changes observed are clustered in the heme-binding pocket, mainly in the internal part, where interchange of the methyl and vinyl groups occurs. To accommodate this structural variation, the protein frame rearranges through small local conformational changes. The latter propagate through the polypeptide chain causing displacements of the main secondary structural elements which, however, are largely maintained. The observed rearrangements, even if small, are significant if we consider that, by itself, the rotation of the heme plane determines only a small change in steric hindrance due to the interchange in the same location of methyl and vinyl groups in that part of the heme buried in the polypeptide frame. The internal part of the heme pocket, being constituted almost exclusively of hydrophobic residues (with the only exception of Ser 71), provides a `greasy' environment which can host the hydrophobic edge of the heme in both conformations. The capability of rearrangement of such pocket allows the heme skeleton to be in a very similar position in the two forms. Furthermore, the mobility of the protein close to the heme pocket seems to facilitate heme reorientation. The protein backbone of cyt b5 Bred, which is less flexible than Box, displays `slow' motions for certain backbone nitrogens that are either in direct van der Waal's contact with the heme (Leu 25) or within one bond of such residues (Trp22, Arg47, Asp53, Asp66, Ile74). Something similar holds for cyt b5 Ared. The Box form is a quite flexible protein where 36 of its backbone nitrogens were identified as participating in conformational-exchange processes. It is interesting to note that cyt b5 Box contains eight more backbone nitrogens displaying `slow' motions relative to cyt b5 Aox and they are the following: Ile24, Thr33, Leu36, Ala50, Gly52, Thr55, Asn57 and Thr73. All, with the exception of Ala50 and Gly52, are very close (within one bond) to residues making van der Waals contacts with the heme. Our structural and dynamics results combined, provide strong experimental evidence for the importance of the protein frame of cyt b5 being designed as such; it possesses enough degrees of liberty to rearrange and accommodate both A and B forms of the heme with very similar final orientation so that they can efficiently perform their biological functions. One of the structural features in heme proteins that has been inferred as being critical for their function, is the interaction of the two charged heme substituents, namely the two propionate groups, with the polypeptide frame and the solvent. With the heme-binding pocket being quite open in both forms, the propionate groups point towards the external part of the protein and are in contact with the solvent. Of the two propionates, one (6-propionate in cyt b5 A) is exposed completely and has been proposed to be involved in the molecular recognition with the physiological partner [19]. In the solution structure of the A form it was found to be quite disordered. The other (7propionate in the cyt b5 A) is better ordered and was proposed [17,35] to be important in stabilizing the extra positive charge present in the oxidized state by forming a hydrogen bond with Ser 64, or at least by moving closer to the iron atom upon oxidation. This behavior was observed and suggested on the basis of the crystal structure of calf cyt b5 [35] and the solution structure of the A form of rat cyt b5 [17]. In addition, it has been observed that one propionate, and for the proteins characterized up until now, invariantly propionate 7, changes its conformation upon a change in oxidation state of the protein [15,17,36±41]. It has, therefore, been proposed to be involved

in the electron-transfer process and to act as a `gate' [17]. In the present B form, propionate 6 occupies the position of propionate 7 in the A form. Propionate 6 in cyt b5 Box experiences NOEs of very similar type and number to propionate 7 in Aox and, therefore, it is concluded that it behaves in the same way. These experimental NOEs (especially those between the b protons of the corresponding propionate and the HN of Ser 64) support the existence of a hydrogen bond between the NH of Ser 64 and one carbonyl oxygen of propionate 7/6 in Aox/Box, respectively. At the same time, propionate 7 of cyt b5 Box is characterized by very similar NOEs to those of propionate 6 in cyt b5 Aox. The latter two propionate groups are characterized by relatively large disorder due to a reduced number of interresidue NOEs ([17] and this work). Therefore, the specific `function' of the propionates is not determined by the heme properties and its substituents, but rather by the protein frame as in the A form it is propionate 7 and in the B form propionate 6 which experiences oxidation-state-dependent structural rearrangements (specifically rotation around the bond connecting the propionate Ca and Cb carbons). The biological importance of the protein possessing this specific folding and design is also implied from this conclusion. Concentrating on the study of the backbone dynamics of cyt b5 B, we should first point to the dramatic difference in mobility between the oxidized and reduced states: 36 vs. 13 backbone nitrogens in the two oxidation states, respectively, were shown to participate in a conformational-exchange process. This result is consistent with that already observed for cyt b5 A [29]. Its significant biological implications have been discussed extensively [29] and are also valid for cyt b5 B. However, the novel aspect of this study results from comparison of the backbone mobility of the A and B conformers of cyt b5 for a specific oxidation state. In the reduced state, no appreciable change is evidenced in the overall backbone mobility in the ms±ms timescale between the two forms. In fact three backbone nitrogens shown to participate in a conformational exchange process in cyt b5 Ared (44, 54, 58) do not show such evidence in cyt b5 Bred. However, four backbone nitrogens are shown to participate in conformational exchange in cyt b5 Bred while they did not in Ared (25, 47, 64 and 66). It should be noted here that in cyt b5 Ared, the backbone 15N of Asp66 had a relatively high value for R1rOFF,cor (8.9 Hz), however, it was not reported as participating in a conformational-exchange process due to the relatively high uncertainty in this specific measurement (8.9 ^ 1.4 Hz). Even though the backbone dynamics behavior in different timescales need not be correlated, it is interesting to note that, in the case of Ser64, a 10-fold increase in the hydrogen-exchange rate and a less restricted amide-bond vector in the ps±ns timescale were evidenced for cyt b5 Bred relative to cyt b5 Ared [16]. In contrast to the reduced state, an appreciable change is evidenced in the ms±ms backbone mobility between the A and B forms in the oxidized state of cyt b5. In fact, we observe an < 30% increase in mobility in the B form relative to the A form (all 28 backbone nitrogens identified also in the A form and eight more already mentioned above). In one of the first studies aimed at understanding the factors controlling the reduction potentials of heme proteins [18] it was shown that the minor (B) form of cyt b5 has a more negative reduction potential (by < 27 mV) relative to the major (A) form. The origin of this difference has previously been ascribed to the loss of a hydrogen bond between the backbone NH of Ser64 and one of the heme propionates in cyt b5 Bred relative to Ared. As discussed above, this hydrogen bond may partially be established with time in cyt b5 Box (present work) and Aox [17], which is consistent

with a set of nine interresidue NOEs for the corresponding propionate group. However, none of these NOEs were observed in cyt b5 Ared [16], where in fact no NOE constraints are reported to have been found between the propionate group and Ser64. In Dangi et al. [16], the existence of this hydrogen bond is weakly supported by interresidue NOEs (only one is actually reported) and subsequently its presence was basically implied from NH-exchange properties. In addition, 70 hydrogen bonds were imposed as structural constraints for the solution structure calculations. Thus, we conclude that the presence of the NH Ser64±carbonyl O of propionate 7 hydrogen bond in cyt b5 Ared, is not determined unequivocally. In any case, in order to further elucidate the factors controlling the reduction potential, experimental data are needed on both oxidation states available in the system examined and this is provided in the present study. While the structural differences are at the limits of the techniques (rmsd between cyt b5 Aox and Box = 0.091 nm and between cyt b5 Ared and Bred = 0.078 nm), the difference in backbone mobility between Aox and Box with respect to the similar mobilities of Ared and Bred is quite significant. The increased ms±ms backbone mobility of cyt b5 Box relative to Aox would correspond to increased entropy (S) for the B form. Because there is no such significant change between Ared and Bred of cyt b5 (and consequently no appreciable entropy change between the two), the documented difference in mobility between Aox and Box could partially account for the lower (more negative) reduction potential of the B relative to the A form. In summary, in the present work we have obtained a highquality structure of the B form of cyt b5 in the oxidized state and have studied the backbone dynamics in the ms±ms timescale of cyt b5 B in both oxidation states, in order to complete the structural and mobility studies of the A and B forms in both oxidation states. Significant insights have been provided on the importance of the design and folding characteristics of the protein frame, and mobility has been proposed to be one of the factors that could control the reduction potential of the heme.
