IMPORTANCE OF THE MEMBRANE IN LIGANDRECEPTOR INTERACTIONS
RONALD W. BEHLING*~ and LYNN W. JELINSKI$

*Squibb Institute for Medical Research, Princeton, NJ 08543; and *AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ 07974, U.S.A. Abstract-NMR data that underscore the importance of the membrane in &and-receptor interactions were obtained and analyzed. The following hypothesis for acetylcholine (ACh) binding to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is proposed: ACh first binds to the membrane, where it adopts its bioactive conformation, and it then rapidly diffuses along the membrane to bind to the AChR in its alreadycorrect conformation. Data used to support this hypothesis include (a) the NMR-determined binding constant of KM = (2.8 f 0.6) X lo3 M-l for the binding of ACh to the asolectin membrane, (b) the lipid dependence of AChR activity, (c) the location of the ACh binding site close to the membrane surface, and (d) the conformation of ACh in its membrane-bound state. Additional experiments to test this hypothesis are proposed.

Although it is well known that the lipophilicity of drugs is an important modulator of pharmacological activity, the details of the interactions of lipophilic drugs with membranes are largely unknown. Many drugs interact on the intracellular and extracellular surfaces of membrane bound receptors, and others are suspected to act at receptor sites in the membrane interior [1,2]. Furthermore, work with bioactive peptides has shown that they undergo conformational changes when added to membrane solutions [34]. These same coronations are thought to be the bioactive form of these peptides. For example, circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies have shown that endorphins adopt helical conformations in mixed solvents and when binding to membranes [6-l 11. Modification of the endorphin peptide sequence to destroy helix formation simultaneously eliminates biological activity [ 121. The lipid composition of membranes clearly has an important role in the activity of membrane-bound receptors. McNamee and coworkers 1131 have performed an elegant series of experiments studying the lipid dependence of the activity of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). They used iipids of defined composition and found that cholesterol and negatively charged lipids greatly enhance the ion response of vesicles [14]. They attributed this effect to vesicle size, but we note that it may aiso be related to interactions between the cationic acetylcholine receptor agonists and the lipid, or to membrane liquidity modulating the activity of the receptor itself. Furthermore, Zabrecky and Raftery [15] found that the optimum lipid composition for AChR activity is precisely the one found in nature, further emphasizing the importance of the membrane composition in receptor activity. The membrane lipid composition may affect the activity of membrane-bound proteins through direct lipid-protein interactions but Schwyzer and cot Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. 49

worker [X&18] and Herbette and coworkers [l, 19,20) propose that ligand interactions with the membrane are important because they optimize the ligand conformation and orientation for binding to the receptor. They also argue that much faster diffusion in the membrane than in bulk solution further enhances the binding rate to the receptor. Schwyzer points out that certain polypeptide hormones interact strongly and specifically with pure lipid membranes, and that these peptides have well defined conformations and orientations when bound to the membranes. He also suggests that the a~umulation of multivalent peptides near charged membr~es may enhance their activity, and he has used such a model to explain the activity of opioid peptides [17]. Herbette et al. [ZO]have experimental evidence for similar partitioning of cardiac drugs where they have shown that certain drugs adopt well-defined positions in the lipid membrane, and that this positioning is different for different drugs. They explain the different pharmaceutical properties of these drugs in terms of the interactions of the drugs with the lipid bilayers. They also calculated for model systems that the approach of a drug to its membrane receptor by diffusion in the lipid bilayer is about loo0 times faster than vision through the aqueous medium 1191. Direct fluorescence measurement show that diffusion of drugs in lipid bilayers is significantly faster than the overall binding to the receptor [l]. We previously used proton NMR relaxation measurements to study the binding of ACh and other agonists to the AChR [21], and transferred nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements to determine the conformation of ACh bound to the receptor [22]. We found that the conformation of ACh in solution is different from the ACh conformation when bound to the high-affinity (desensitized) state of the AChR. We also found the unexpected result that the confo~ations of ACh in the lipid and when bound to the receptor are the same. Our observations of ACh conformation and lipid affinity, taken together with the findings of Schwyzer

and Herbette, lead us to propose that the lipid plays an impo~ant role in the binding of ACh to the AChR. This hypothesis is shown schematically in Fig. 1. After ACh is released from the synaptic vesicles (Fig. la) it diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to the large exposed membrane on the target cell (Fig. lb). Once in the lipid, ACh undergoes a conformational change [22] and furthermore undergoes two-dimensional diffusion to the receptor site. Two-dimensional diffusion is much faster than three-dimensiona di~sion, and this reduced dimensionality would enhance collisions between ACh and the AChR [19]. Already in its bioactive conformation, ACh then binds to the AChR (Fig. lc). Although the exact location of the ACh binding site on the o-subunits of the AChR is unknown, it has

been localised recently to approximately residues 158-216 by several groups [Z&27]. This site has been localised at the membrane surface [27]. In this paper we examine the experimental data that support the hypothesis outlined in Fig. 1 and provide order-of-magnitude calculations that relate this hypothesis to relaxation data and to data in the literature. Experiments to test this hypothesis are proposed.

distributions and protein binding sites has been described previously [21]. NMR samples were prepared by vacuum concentrating affinity-purified receptors and dialyzing the concentrated (typically 60-1OO~M in binding sites) asolectin-protein preparation against three changes of dialysis buffer [20 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.4% cholate], followed by three more dialyses against the same buffer prepared with D20. The acetylcholine esterase activity of the protein preparation was inhibited by adding 1 PL diisopropyl fluorophosphate (Aldrich) to the NMR tube containing the receptor preparation. When needed for control experiments, a 3- to 4-fold stoichiometric excess of cu-bungarotoxin was added to the NMR sample to block ACh binding to the AChR. The NMR samples were stable for several days at 23" and for longer periods at 4". The binding activity of the receptors was destroyed by freezing the samples. All NMR measurements on the receptor system were mader on a Bruker AM 360MHz wide-bore spectrometer equipped with an Aspect 3000 data system. The binding of ACh to asolectin was measured on a JEOL GSXJOO by measuring selective relaxation times of the trimethylammonium protons of ACh in asolectin as a function of ACh concentration. The selective relaxation rates (Rttbs = l/T,,,,,) were fit by a least-squares routine to the equation:

pulse from the decoupler. The reported Tr values were determined by a three-parameter fit. The relaxation data were always single exponential over the entire range of T values. Two-dimensional NOE NMR data sets were obtained in the phase sensitive mode [29] at a temperature of 25". The mixing time for the receptorcontaining samples was 800 msec and the relaxation delay was 6 set; for the sample of ACh in D20 the mixing time was 2 set and the relaxation delay was 10 sec. The samples for NOE measurements contained 10 mM ACh and 91 PM AChR. The data were processed, and peak volumes were extracted with FTNMR from Hare Research (Woodinville, WA). A complete relaxation rate analysis and subtraction techniques were used to determine the conformations of ACh in DrO, in the lipid, and bound to the AChR. The details of this analysis have been described [22]. The cross-relaxation rates were used to determine a set of interproton distances, and these distances are repeated in Table 1 for completeness. The distances shown in Table 1 are not sufficient to provide a unique description of the conformation of ACh. Conformational energies corresponding to four possible families of structures were calculated using the Dreiding potentials of the Biograf 1.34 program (Biodesign, Pasadena, CA) as described previously [22]. The lowest energy conformation was calculated to be 7 kcal/mol higher in energy than the crystal structure conformation.

The distances obtained from analysis of the NOE results (Table 1) show that there are major conformational differences between ACh in its free state and in its lipid- and receptor-bound states. The major difference is that the arrangement of the N-C-CO backbone goes from gauche in solution to nearly tram in both the lipid-bound and receptor-bound states. These differences are presented in Fig. 2. The solution state conformation (Fig. 2a) is in agreement with the conformation determined by X-ray crystallography [30]. The gauche conformation that occurs in the crystal is stabilized by the interaction of the positively charged nitrogen group with the electron-rich oxygen. We hypothesize that this inter-

action is lost when the ACh molecule interacts either with the lipid or with amino acid sidechains in the active site of the receptor, allowing ACh to adopt a trans conformation. The similarity between the conformation of ACh interacting with the lipid and that bound to the AChR is interesting, as such a similarity has already been conjectured [31]. The selective relaxation data (Table 2) also point to an interaction between ACh and the lipid. The selective T,s of all the ACh protons decrease in going from a D20 environment to a lipid environment, and there is a larger decrease in going to the receptorbound environment. Upper bounds for the lifetimes of ACh in the lipidassociated and the receptor-bounds states can be estimated from the data in Table 2 using the equation: 1

in the T, observed when ACh associates with the lipid is fairly uniform (Table 2, column 2). The T1 differences between the lipid environment and the AChR-bound state (Table 3, column 3) show large differences. The largest changes are seen for the CH20(CO)CH3 and the acetyl methyl protons. These large changes may reflect specific ACh-AChR interactions at the binding state. Together with the literature cited at the beginning of the paper, the conformational data (Table 1) and the relaxation data (Table 2) support the hypothesis that the overall binding reaction ACh + R Z AChR involves two steps: [ACh-M] WhlPf

The upper bound on the lifetime of ACh in its lipidassociated state is about 500 msec, and for ACh in its receptor-bound state it is 6 msec. The data in Table 2 are more instructive if one calculates the factor decrease in the ACh Tl in going from the water environment to the lipid environment to the receptor environment (Table 3). The overall change in the Tl ranges from 2.2 for the choline methyl protons to 5.5 for the acetyl methyl protons (Table 3, column 1). The factor of 1.2 to 1.4 decrease

Membrane in ligand-receptor interactions where M and R refer to the membrane and receptor, as before, and + and - refer to the on- and off-rates respectively. The total free energy change for bindin of the ACh to the AChR is about -11 kcal Bmol as measured in radiolabeled ligand binding studies [33]. This energy will be divided between binding of the ACh to the membrane (AGM) and to the receptor (AGR). The conformational energy difference between ACh in D20 and ACh in lipid has been calculated in uucuo to be about +7 kcal/mol [22]. However, complete immersion of the ACh into the lipid is expected to be accompanied by an energy change of -9.25 kcal/mol based on surface area for ACh of 370 A2 (calculated using the CONGEN program [34]) and an expected energy change of 25 cal - mol-' . A-* [35]. This gives a net binding energy AGM = -2 kcal/mol. Selective spin-lattice relaxation rate measurements of ACh interacting with pure asolectin liposomes show that KM = (2.8 & 0.6) x lo3 M-`, so AGv = -4.7 kcal/mol. AGR is the remaining energy, which is -6.6 kcal/ mol. Using these values of AG, we now estimate the lifetimes of ACh in the membrane-bound (Q) and receptor-bound (rR) states to determine if they are within the limits set by the NMR measurements (r,,, < 500 msec; rR < 6 msec) . To estimate the lifetimes of ACh in the membrane bound and receptor bound states, it is necessary to evaluate the rate constants for the binding steps. Using the steady-state approximation for the formation of the complex ACh-M, and determining the rate of formation of ACh-R, it can be shown that The lifetime of the receptor-bound acetylcholine

For any reasonable choice of rates, it will be true that kh[A] +[ACh-R]ki. It is necessary to determine what range of rate constants will fit the observed binding in the stopped flow measurements and the NMR measurements. We will choose a value of k& and determine the remaining rate constants by rearranging Equation 7 to give

and by using k, = kh/Kw and k, = kfi/KR. In the NMR experiments, the total ACh concentration is 10 x 10e3 M. The exact total lipid concentration is unknown, but it is estimated that [Ml, = 5 x 10e3M. The [M] will therefore be about 3.15 x low4 M based on KM. Initially, the receptor concentration, [RI, is 90 x 10m6M. Using these numbers, along with k&, = 5.7 x 10' M-' see-' [32], the NMR-derived value for K,, and assuming that k;t, = 1 x lOa M-l set-1 (i.e. a diffusion-controlled reaction), we find that k, = 3.6 x lo4 see-`, and k, = 8.7 x kR+= 7.7 x lo7 M-' set-`, lo* M-l set-`. The lifetime of the membrane-bound ACh-M complex is: t,,, = [k$,[ACh] + k&]-l

There are several lines of evidence presented at the beginning of the paper that suggest that binding of ligands to membranes plays an important role in mediating the binding of a ligand to its receptor. The arguments by Schwyzer and coworker [16-181 and Herbette and coworkers [l, 19,201 are persuasive, but they lack direct evidence that the ligands diffuse in the membrane to the receptor site and that the conformation of the ligand in the membrane is related to the conformation of the receptor-bound ligand. The evidence that ACh binding to the receptor is mediated by the membrane is based on the observed affinity of ACh for the membrane, the lipid dependence of AChR activity [B-15], the location of the ACh binding site close to the membrane surface [26,27], and that the lifetimes of ACh bound to the membrane and receptor fall within the limits set by the NMR measurements. The key piece of evidence is that the conformation of ACh in the lipid is the same as the ACh conformation bound to the AChR. We suggest that the ACh first binds the membrane, adopting the conformation that will be recognized by the AChR, and then rapidly diffuses along the membrane to the AChR. Although the arguments presented here are suggestive, they do not prove the hypothesis. Proof will require information along the following lines. Detailed kinetic models of the multiple binding steps must be consistent with observed data from stoppedflow and other measurements. There must also be direct evidence that diffusion of ACh in the membrane is important, such as observing the activity of the AChR as a function of solution viscosity, or by slowing the diffusion of the AChR in the membrane by adding large amounts of other membrane-bound proteins to interfere with the diffusion of the ACh to the AChR. The final proof, of course, would be the direct observation of membrane-bound ligand binding to the AChR.
