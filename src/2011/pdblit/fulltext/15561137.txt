The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) family of single extracellular immunoglobulin receptors includes both activating and inhibitory isoforms whose ligands are unknown. TREM-1 activation amplifies the Toll-like receptor initiated responses to invading pathogens allowing the secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Hence, TREM-1 amplifies the inflammation induced by both bacteria and fungi, and thus represents a potential therapeutic target. We report the ° crystal structure of the human TREM-1 extracellular domain at 1.47 A resolution. The overall fold places it within the V-type immunoglobulin domain family and reveals close homology with Ig domains from antibodies, T-cell receptors and other activating receptors, such as NKp44. With the additional use of analytical ultracentrifugation and 1H NMR spectroscopy of both human and mouse TREM-1, we have conclusively demonstrated the monomeric state of this extracellular ectodomain in solution and, presumably, of the TREM family in general.

Keywords: crystal structure; activating receptors; TREM-1; innate immunity; immune system receptor systems have been characterized and include the paired immunoglobulin receptors,1,2 NKp443 human natural killer cell receptor and the SHPS-1 family. 4 Recently, a new family of receptors expressed exclusively on myeloid cells, termed triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREMs), was described5,6 and, as for NKp44, have only one Ig-like domain, which differentiates them from other multiple Ig-like domain activating receptors. The various isoforms of the TREM family share low sequence identity to each other and to other members of the Ig superfamily (Figure 1). TREM-1 is expressed by neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages and is a crucial mediator of septic shock and amplification of inflammatory responses to bacteria.5,7,8 TREM-2 is expressed by immature dendritic cells where it stimulates nitric oxide and regulates the development and function of dendritic cells, microglia and osteoclasts.9,10 Defects in human TREM-2 expression result in Nasu-Hakola disease, a rare condition causing bone cysts and presenile dementia.11,12 Murine TREM-3 is expressed in mouse macrophages, is upregulated in response to lipopolysaccharides and, like TREM-2, stimulates the release of nitric oxide.13 In humans, however, TREM-3 is a pseudogene.13

Introduction
During the initial stages of microbial infection, the host initiates an innate immune response to slow pathogen proliferation while the adaptive T- and B-cell responses are activated and matured. Monocyte and macrophage cells of the innate immune system lack the highly diverse repertoire of B- and T-cell receptors that define cells of the adaptive immune system. Instead, they express a variety of activating and inhibitory cell surface receptors, which have similarity in their extracellular region or ectodomains, but lack any cytoplasmic signaling domains. In order to transduce a signal, they must first associate with transmembrane adaptor proteins, such as DAP12, CD3z and FcRg, which contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Several immunoglobulin (Ig)-like activating receptor

Crystal Structure of Human TREM-1

Figure 1. Sequence alignment of the extracellular immunoglobulin domains in members of the TREM family and summary of constructs used in this study. Human TREM-1 was aligned with all known members of the TREM family. Secondary structure assignments correspond to human TREM-1. Complete sequence conservation is labeled white in red background, whereas red letters correspond to O60% sequence homology. The intrachain disulfide bridge cysteines and their flanking consensus sequences are boxed in black. Strand A 0 is not visible in monomer B. Sequences for the mouse and human TREM-1 Full Ig domains are italicized. The four N-terminal residues not included in the hTREM-1 Ig domain and Ig domainCstalk constructs are underlined.

TREM-1 is an important direct link between innate and adaptive immunity.14 Indeed, ligation of TREM-1 triggers the differentiation of primary monocytes into immature dendritic cells by stimulating the production of tumor necrosis factor-a and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor. TREM-1 also increases expression of antigen presenting molecules, CD86 and MHC Class II. Moreover, TREM-1 derived dendritic cells more ¨ efficiently present antigen to naive T-cells and stimulate interferon-g production by TH1 cells.15 Therefore, TREM-1 likely plays a role in both the adaptive and innate immune responses. Although no specific ligands have yet been identified, indirect evidence suggests that TREM-1 can recognize either bacterial products, similar to other pattern recognition receptors, or protein ligands.15 Thus, TREMs may work synergistically with the Toll-like receptors to sense and respond to microbial infections. Upon LPS stimulation, TREM-1 activates neutrophils and monocytes and induces the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, myeloperoxidase (neutrophils) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1, monocytes). TREM-1 expression is upregulated in patients with microbial sepsis and mice with LPS-induced septic shock.7 Moreover, when infected mice were treated with a TREM-1 extracellular domain--IgG F c fusion protein, cytokine production was reduced and mortality fell from 94% to 24%. More importantly, this protection was effective up to four hours after infection.7 Hence, TREM-1 has been implicated as a mediator of septic shock, which is caused by an excessive inflammatory reaction.16,17 More recently, soluble TREM-1 found in bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid of patients on ventilators was demonstrated to

be a clear indication of bacterial or fungal pneumonia.18 Human TREM-1 (hTREM-1) consists of an extracellular region of 194 amino acid residues (aa), a membrane spanning domain (29 aa) and a cytoplasmic tail (5 aa), with no signaling motifs. The extracellular Ig domain shows low sequence homology to members of the Ig superfamily (Ig-SF) and contains the motif Asp-X-Gly-X-Tyr-X-Cys, which corresponds to the signature of a V-type Ig domain.5,19 The Ig ectodomain is connected to the transmembrane region by an w60 residue, prolinerich linker containing three N-glycosylation sites, which account for the difference between the apparent molecular mass (w30 kDa) versus the predicted protein molecular mass (26 kDa).5 The transmembrane region contains a single Lys residue which is involved in the association of TREMs with the signal transducing molecule, DAP12. The DAP12 homodimer possesses immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in its cytoplasmic domains and associates with TREM-1 via formation of a salt-bridge with an Asp residue in the transmembrane portion of DAP12.5,20 Interestingly, the TREM gene cluster also encodes TREM-like transcripts (TLT) 1, 2 and 3, each of which contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in their cytoplasmic tails that may cause them to function as TREM inhibitors.21,22 The structure of TREM-1 is of particular interest for several reasons. The structure of TREM-1 is key to understanding the molecular and structural principles that determine recognition of the still elusive TREM ligands and to define the unique functions that may depend on the oligomerization

1239 filtration and anion exchange chromatography (see Materials and Methods). hTREM-1 crystallizes in ° ° spacegroup P61 (aZbZ110.94 A and cZ46.84 A), with two monomers per asymmetric unit. The crystal structure of the receptor was determined at ° 1.47 A by the multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method using the anomalous signal from five selenomethionine residues. Initial 3FoK 2Fc electron density maps were of excellent quality and facilitated the unambiguous building of residues 21­133 of monomer A and 26­135 of monomer B. After 14 iterations of model building and refinement, the final model consisted of 223 protein residues, one tartrate molecule from the mother liquor and 175 water molecules, with Rcryst and Rfree values of 19.5% and 21.2%, respectively (Table 1). Four residues, Ser50 and Ser51 of molecule A and Cys41 and Cys113 of molecule B, were found to have alternative side-chain conformations. Occupancies for each conformer were set to 0.5. Superimposition of monomer A onto monomer B gave root-meansquare deviations (rmsd's) for main-chain and all ° ° atoms of 0.81 A and 1.18 A, respectively. These relatively high rmsd values are due to significant

state of this activating receptor. Moreover, TREM-1 is a potential target for the development of septic shock therapeutics. Thus, we have determined the ° crystal structure of human TREM-1 at 1.47 A resolution. Comparison of the TREM-1 structure to other members of the Ig-V type fold demonstrates a close structural relationship, despite very low sequence identity and disparate functions. Furthermore, this structural study, coupled with rigorous biophysical characterization of both human and mouse TREM-1, clearly demonstrates the monomeric nature of the globular ectodomain of this receptor which differs from the conclusions of a previous structural study.23

The model stereochemistry is good (Table 1), with 93.4% of the residues in the most favored regions and one residue, Ser77, in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot.24 However, the electron density for Ser77 is excellent and locates the Ser (4Z758, jZ1408) to a tight type II b-turn between strands C 0 and C 00 . Furthermore, Ser77 is not conserved within the TREM family, or in the human natural killer cell receptor, NKp44. Comparison with Ig domain family members TREM-1 (Figure 2(a) and (b), cyan) maintains an overall structure that is homologous to other members of the Ig family, despite low sequence identity with the extracellular domain of human NKp44 (27.6%, PDB entry 1hkf, Figure 2(b), red), the mouse 2C TCR Va domain (15.6%, PDB entry 1tcr, Figure 2(b), green) and a mouse IgG VH domain (12.9%, PDB entry 1mfa, Figure 2(b), light blue). The 310 helix between E and F of TREM-1 is longer than that in the TCR Va and comparable in size to that in human NKp44. TREM-1 lacks the

extra stabilizing disulfide bond (Cys37­Cys45) present in the activating receptor NKp44. Furthermore, NKp44 contains a positively-charged groove,25,26 formed between the b-hairpins of C­C 0 and G­F, and the external face of the AGFCC 0 b-sheet, which ° ° ° is 15 A long, 7 A deep and 8 A wide, and lined with four basic residues, Arg47, His88, Arg92 and Arg.106 The largest difference between TREM-1 and other V-type Ig domains are the two b-hairpins, C­C 0 and G­F which protrude from the Ig domain b° ° sandwich. The TREM groove is 17 A long, 10 A ° deep and 6 A wide, which is narrower and deeper than that of NKp44. Comparison with the pre° viously published TREM-1 at 2.6 A resolution23 (PDB entry 1q8m) structure reveals a similar threedimensional structures (rmsd of all atoms and Ca ° atoms (110 of 110) 1.99 A and 1.58, respectively) (Figure 3), but with significant deviations in the G­F loop which represent a potential region of plasticity. Coordinates of TREM-1, NKp44, the TCR Va domain and the IgG VH domain were submitted for structural analysis using the program DALI.27 The DALI scores revealed similar structural homology of TREM-1 with NKp44 (15.4; PDB entry 1hkf), mouse IgG VH (12.4; PDB entry 1mfa), mouse TCR

Va (12.9; PDB entry 1tcr), human Vd9-Vg2 TCR Vg (10.8; PDB code 1hxm) and with itself as a control (25.3). The rmsd for the respective core regions (57 ° Ca) between TREM-1 and NKp44 (0.72 A), mouse ° ° IgG VH (0.98 A) and mouse TCR Va (0.89 A) further confirms the close structural relationships among members of this subset of Ig-SF family members despite disparate biological functions (Figure 2). TREM-1 ectodomain is a monomer The web-based program Jpred28 predicted the first several amino acid residues of the TREM-1 coding sequence to be unstructured and were, therefore, removed from our construct to increase the likelihood of success in the crystallization experiments. The two TREM-1 molecules in the asymmetric unit pack with the N and C termini oriented in the same direction (Figure 4). This interaction is asymmetric with no 2-fold NCS in which molecule A is rotated w908 relative to B and only the first three residues (strand A) of molecule A hydrogen bond to b-strand B of molecule B. There was no interpretable electron density for the first five N-terminal residues of molecule B. Although these two monomers make extensive crystal pack-

ing contacts with other symmetry-related molecules in the crystal, none of these interactions are symmetric or suggestive of a biologically-relevant oligomer. Furthermore, while the calculated shape complementarity index (Sc) between monomer A and B was good (0.70),29 relatively little (10%, ° 655 A2) of the total surface area of each monomer is buried in this interface. It is possible that the unusually high protein concentrations (50­100 mg mlK1) used in crystallization experiments resulted in a non-natural oligomeric state. However, during purification, TREM-1 Ig (residues 21­139, MW 13.7 kDa) existed as an 11.4 kDa monomer as observed by gel filtration (Figure 5(a), brown). The hTREM-1 IgC stalk (residues 21­194, MW 19.9 kDa) eluted as a w35 kDa protein (Figure 5(a), black) but its behavior was altered, due to its helical stalk region, that permitted protein flow around matrix beads, not through them, thus reducing the retention time. To more rigorously assess the solution state of the TREM-1 Ig domain and hTREM-1 IgCstalk, we used sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation over a broad range of protein concentrations (0.5­15 mg mlK1). Sedimentation equilibrium scans of lysozyme were

1243 that strand A (including the initiating methionine and next four residues) of one monomer hydrogen bonds with strand B of its opposing monomer. Strand A 0 then bonds to the G strand of the opposing b-sheet before continuing with the canonical hydrogen bonding to strand G 0 of its own b-sheet. In our TREM-1 structure, strand A 0 forms the canonical hydrogen bonds to strand G in the same domain. This TREM-1 "domain-swapped" dimer also has good surface complementarity, ScZ 0.67, but with a much more extensive buried surface ° area of w1700 A2, corresponding to about 25% of the total monomer surface. The dimer buried ° surface area is still substantial (w1000 A2), even when the first five amino acid residues, including the initiating methionine, are removed to re-create the actual N-terminal truncation in our construct. The dimer interface is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and two intermolecular salt bridges between Asp60 to Arg72 and Glu62 to His123, whereas we observed an intramolecular salt bridge between Glu62 and Arg128 in molecule B. The presence of this "domain-swapped dimer" could be partially attributed to the significantly higher crystallization salt concentrations (2.1­2.4 M ammonium sulfate), that would help mediate hydrophobic interactions in addition to fortuitous complementarity of the charged residues involved in these intermolecular salt bridges. Given the extent of the buried surface area and the extensive nature of the intermolecular interactions at the dimer interface, it was surprising that we failed to observed this dimer in our structural studies. Hence, to address the possibility that the four N-terminal amino acid residues absent from our construct were responsible for dimer formation, we used 1D 1H NMR, gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation on both human and mouse TREM-1 full Ig domains to ascertain the oligomeric nature of these longer constructs. To probe the solution state of the TREM-1 full Ig domains (residues 17­139) and assess the effect of pH on the oligomerization state, measurements of the transverse relaxation times (T2) of the amide protons were carried out using a 1D 1H one-one spin echo experiment31,32 at various pH values in the range from 5.5 to 8.5. At different lengths of the echo delay (100 ms and 2.9 ms), the intensity of the amide proton signals were differently modulated so as to enable a determination of the transverse relaxation time. The intensities of 10 separated amide resonances between 8.0 and 10.4 ppm were used to extract an average T2 relaxation time (Table 2). At pH 5.5, the average T2 relaxation times for the human and mouse proteins were 18.0G2.4 ms and 17.0G1.6 ms, respectively. For

best fit using a single species fit which yielded a molecular mass of 15,120 Da, close to the calculated mass of 14,400 Da (data not shown). Velocity data analyzed by the c(s) method30 gave Svedberg values (Figure 5(b)) of 1.65 for the hTREM-1 Ig domain and 1.90 for the hTREM-1 IgCstalk protein, also suggestive of monomeric states. For comparison, S-values of lysozyme (14,400 Da) and the bifunctional human aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC), an w128,000 Da dimer, were 1.8 and 6.0, respectively. The sedimentation equilibrium profiles of hTREM-1 Ig (Figure 5(c)) and hTREM-1 IgC stalk (Figure 5(d)) proteins were best fit using single species models giving molar masses of 13,438 Da for the Ig domain and 20,206 Da, for the full length protein, in excellent agreement with their respective calculated monomer masses of 13,736 Da and 19,882 Da. Therefore, we concluded that our hTREM-1 construct is a monomer in solution. Recently, the crystal structure of the human ° TREM-1 extracellular domain at 2.6 A was published in which a "domain-swapped" homodimer was proposed (Figure 6; PDB code 1q8m).23 The first seven amino acid residues (16­22), including the initiating methionine and the four N-terminal amino acid residues that were not present in our construct, are involved in the domain swap, such

comparison, lysozyme, which is known to be a monomer in solution with molecular weight 14,400 Da,33­35 had an average T2 relaxation time of 15.6G1.8 ms. Similarly at pH 6.5, human and mouse TREM-1 had average T2 relaxation times of 18.8G2.7 ms and 17.9G2.2 ms, respectively, as compared to 16.9G3.1 ms for lysozyme. Spectra taken at pH 7.5 yielded T2 relaxation times for human and mouse TREM-1 and lysozyme of 15.2G 1.2 ms, 14.7G1.0 ms and 11.1G1.0 ms, respectively. Finally, at pH 8.5, the average T2 relaxation times for human and mouse TREM-1 were 13.6G1.6 ms and 11.9G0.9 ms, respectively, as compared to 10.9G 1.4 ms for lysozyme. Thus, as assessed by NMR, the TREM-1 proteins in solution are monomeric and show no pH dependent higher-order association. As assessed by gel filtration, both human and mouse TREM-1 full Ig domains eluted at 12.1 kDa and 15.1 kDa, respectively, that approximates their expected monomeric size of w14 kDa (Figure 5(a)). In addition, the sedimentation equilibrium scans of the human (Figure 5(e)) and mouse (Figure 5(f)) proteins were best fit using single species models giving molar masses of 13,594 Da for the human and 13,259 Da, for the mouse proteins, again, in close agreement with their respective calculated masses of 14,205 Da and 13,994 Da. Sedimentation equilibrium scans of lysozyme were also best fit using single species fits which yielded a molecular mass of 15,120 Da, close to the calculated mass of 14,400 Da (data not shown). Furthermore, sedimentation velocity experiments gave c(s) distributions with a single large peak corresponding to a Svedberg value of 1.55 for both the human and mouse TREM-1 full Ig domains, also suggestive of monomeric solution states (Figure 5(b)). The S-values of two control proteins, lysozyme and ATIC were 1.8 and 6.0, respectively. Moreover, although asymmetric homodimers are possible,36 they are extremely rare in biological systems. Hence, when taken together, the biophysical and crystallographic evidence presented here, strongly suggest that in solution the globular head of the TREM-1 ectodomain is monomeric. Its oligomeric status could certainly be influenced when the intact receptor is embedded in the membrane of the cell

surface or on ligand engagement, as observed for other cell membrane receptors, such as the Erythropoietin receptor.37,38 Biological implications Surfaces and electrostatic potentials were calculated with INSIGHTII in an attempt to identify the region on TREM-1 that might be responsible for interaction with potential ligands; however, no such region could be identified. The predicted isoelectric point for the extracellular domain of TREM-1 is 7.15, which mirrors the overall dispersed surface electrostatic potentials, in that there is no specific localization of electrostatic charge that would suggest a potential ligand binding site (Figure 7). The structural differences of the F-G loop (Figure 3) between our hTREM-1 model and the previously published model suggests an area of flexibility which may move in response to ligation. The unique "head-to-tail" dimer of the previously published TREM-1 structure predicts two separate ligand binding sites comprised of the equivalent CDR binding loops (Figure 6). However, given the likely monomeric state of TREM-1, and presumably of the TREM family, this bi-valent recognition mode is highly unlikely. Our data do not, however, eliminate possible homo-dimeric association upon ligand binding or of the membrane tether, as discussed above. While data presented here do not allow for more informed speculation on ligand binding sites, TREM-1 recognition of its cognate ligand using antibody-equivalent CDR loops, in an analogous fashion to TCRs, CD8 and CTLA-4, is highly feasible. In summary, by combining crystallography and biophysical measurements, we have conclusively demonstrated the monomeric solution state of the TREM-1 globular ectodomain. Further identification of actual TREM-1 ligands and the structure of the TREM-1/ligand complex are the next crucial steps in elucidating the mechanism by which TREMs mediate the innate response to microbial products.

Protein expression and purification The plasmid, pET-22b(C) (Novagen, Wi, USA) encoding residues 21­139 (Ig domain), 17­139 (full Ig domain) or 21­194 (hTREM-1 IgCstalk) of hTREM-1 or residues 17­139 (full Ig domain) of mouse TREM-1, was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) RIL-codon plus cells (Stratagene, CA, USA) and grown at 37 8C. After reaching an O.D. of 0.8 at 600 nm, recombinant expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for three hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. Inclusion bodies were purified and solubilized in 8 M urea, 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 mM and 100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , diluted to 2 mg mlK1 and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.4 M arginine, 0.25 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM GSH, 0.1 mM GSSG and 0.05% PEG 4K for 24 hours at 4 8C. Refolded protein was then dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, pH 8.5 and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol for 24 hours at 4 8C and centrifuged to removed precipitated protein. Soluble, refolded protein was then purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75 16/60, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) as a single peak. It was further purified by anion exchange chromatography (Mono Q 10/10, Pharmacia) using a gradient (0­100%) in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.5 and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol to 10 mM Tris, pH 8.5 and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol with 1 M NaCl. The

single, large peak containing the protein was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration (Superdex 75 26/60, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) into 20 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT. Typical yield was 30 mg refolded protein LK1 cell culture. Selenomethionine-substituted protein was made by growing cells in methionine-deficient minimal medium supplemented with 50 mg LK1 Se-met (Sigma). Se-Met containing hTREM-1 Ig was purified as described above. Se-Met incorporation was 100% as assessed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

Crystallization and data collection Crystals of hTREM-1 Ig (residues 21­139; 50­ 100 mg mlK1) grew from 20% PEG 4K and 0.2 M diammonium tartrate, pH 6.3 at 4 8C, after three weeks using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals were `flash-cooled' to K180 8C in cryoprotectant consist° ing of well buffer and 25% glycerol. A 1.47 A native data set was collected on a single crystal at beamline 5.0.1 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) in Berkeley (Table 1). Data for MAD phasing were collected from a second ° single crystal at three wavelengths (Table 1) to 2.05 A on beamline 5.0.2 at the ALS in Berkeley. Data were processed and scaled with HKL2000.39 The spacegroup ° is P61 with unit cell dimensions aZbZ110.94 A and cZ ° 46.84 A, and two hTREM-1 molecules per asymmetric

° unit (VmZ3.0 A3/Da) corresponding to a solvent content of 60%. Structure determination and refinement The positions of the selenium atoms (5 of 6) and initial phases determined by SOLVE40 were improved by density modification using RESOLVE,40 which resulted in the overall figure of merit (FOM) increasing from 0.40 to 0.66. The sixth selenium atom is located in a highly disordered region. These initial electron density maps ° were of excellent quality. The 2.05 A maps were used for initial automated model building (8 chains, connectivity index 0.94) and refinement with ARP/wARP41 and facilitated building of residues 21­133 of monomer A and 26­135 of monomer B using O.42 Refinement using ° the native data set to 1.47 A was performed using Crystallography and NMR System software (CNS version 1.1).43 NCS restraints were not incorporated due to the exceptional quality and resolution of the electron density maps. The model was further rebuilt into sA-weighted 3FoK2Fc, and FoKFc electron density maps in O. One molecule of tartrate from the mother liquor was included in the refinement after the third round of manual rebuilding. Water molecules were assigned automatically in CNS at O3s FoKFc difference density peaks and verified by manual inspection in O. After convergence in CNS (RcrystZ23.1%, RfreeZ24.7%), refinement was continued with REFMAC5 using TLS refinement and with riding hydrogens.44 Care was taken to keep the Rfree test set intact during all refinement steps. The final model (RcrystZ19.3%, RfreeZ20.6%; Table 1) is composed of 175 water molecules, one tartrate molecule and all residues except residues 134­139 of monomer A and 21­25 and 136­139 of monomer B, which showed no interpretable electron density. The quality of the model was analyzed using the program PROCHECK.24 All surface area calculations used the program SC from the CCP4 suite ° with a probe radius of 1.7 A and a dot density of 25. Coordinates Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 1SMO. Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation The hydrodynamic molecular masses of the human and mouse TREM-1 proteins and control proteins lysozyme and human ATIC, were determined by sedimentation equilibrium measurements with a temperature-controlled Beckman XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge equipped with either An-60 Ti or An-50 Ti rotors using both interference and absorbance optics (Beckman Instrument Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Protein samples were loaded in a double-sector cell equipped with a 12 mm Epon centerpiece and sapphire optical windows. The proteins were dialyzed into the crystallization buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT) except the control protein, lysozyme, which was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, due to its low solubility in the TREM-1 crystallization buffer. Samples at concentrations ranging from 0.5 mg to 15 mg mlK1 were monitored at rotor speeds of 12,000­ 50,000 rpm at 20 8C and the data analyzed by a non-linear least squares approach using WinNonLin (Pharsite, Mountain View, CA) using single species and monomerdimer models. The molar masses presented are the results of global, simultaneous fits using three rotor speeds and

three or four concentrations of each protein, while the figures show a single representative fit from the set of globally fit scans. The sedimentation profiles of the human and mouse TREM-1 were best fit using single species models giving molar masses in near perfect agreement with the sequence masses. In the highest concentrations of hTREM-1 Ig (15 mg mlK1), some nonspecific higher order oligomerization was observed as evidenced by the higher mass of a single species fit, the inability to fit to a dimer and by non-random residuals. Sedimentation velocity Sedimentation velocity experiments of the human and mouse TREM-1 proteins were used for species comparisons and sedimentation coefficient determination. The proteins were dialyzed into the crystallization buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA and 5 mM DTT) except the control proteins, lysozyme and human aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC), which were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, due to low solubility in the TREM-1 crystallization buffer. The data were collected on a temperature-controlled Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an An-60 Ti rotor and photoelectric scanner. A doublesector cell, equipped with a 12 mm Epon centerpiece and sapphire windows, was loaded with 400­420 ml of sample. Samples at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 15 mg mlK1 were monitored with both absorbance and interference optics at a rotor speed of 50,000 rpm in continuous mode at 25 8C, with a step size of 0.003 cm employing an average of one scan per point. Scans were analyzed using the c(s) method from the program Sedfit, with RI and TI noise as fitted variables.30 After initial fits, meniscus and cell bottom positions were allowed to float for the final analysis. NMR Spectroscopy 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy of the human and mouse TREM-1 full Ig domains (Figure 1) and lysozyme (Sigma, St Louis, MO; used without further purification) was used to determine the average transverse 1HN relaxation time (T2). The unlabeled protein samples were concentrated to between 0.7 and 2.0 mM (10­30 mg mlK1) and dialyzed into PBS at pH 5.5, 6.5, 7.5 or 8.5. The NMR samples consisted of 600 ml of 90% H2O/10% D2O containing PBS, 5 mM deuterated DTT and 0.03% mM NaN3, except lysozyme, which contained no DTT (CIL, MA, USA). All NMR measurements were performed at 298 K on a Bruker Avance600 spectrometer equipped with five radio-frequency channels and a triple resonance probe (TXI-HCN-z gradient). The lengths of the echo delays were 100 ms and 2.9 ms. The intensities of 10 separated amide proton resonances between 8.0 and 10.4 ppm were used to extract an average T2 relaxation time. Care was taken to compare the same 1HN lines at each pH value. The spectra were processed and analyzed using the program Xwinnmr3.5 (Bruker, Billerica, USA).
