Macromolecular NMR Section Structural Biophysics Laboratory, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick MD 21702-1201, USA The complex and interrelated function of the interleukin cytokines relies on a range of pro-in¯ammatory and anti-in¯ammatory immune responses mediated by an array of receptors, and there is considerable cross-reactivity for related cytokines. Recent ®ndings continue to elucidate the expression patterns of interleukin receptors associated with a range of diseases, including cancer. We report here the ®rst experimentally determined high-resolution structure of human interleukin-13 (IL13). The experimental structure is signi®cantly different from an earlier homology model, which could have led to improper estimation of receptor interaction surfaces and design of mutational experiments. Similarities between the presented IL-13 structure and the homogolous interleukin-4 (IL-4) are discussed. Additionally, mutation data for IL-4 and IL-13 are analyzed and combined with a detailed structural analysis of the IL-4/ IL4Ra interface that leads us to postulate interactions at the IL-13/receptor interface. The structural comparison is used to interpret the different af®nities for various receptors and establishes the basis for further mutational experiments and antagonist design.

Introduction
Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokine that elicits both pro-in¯ammatory and antiin¯ammatory immune responses. At least two receptors exist for IL-13, one of which is shared with interleukin-4 (IL-4). The shared receptor is a heterodimer composed of IL4Ra and IL13Ra1, and it is expressed by numerous cells, including endothelial cells, synovial cells, and several cancer cells.1,2 The relatively low af®nity of IL-13 for

IL13Ra1 is increased by approximately tenfold in the presence of IL4Ra.1,3 A chimeric IL-4/endotoxin protein, which was shown to target the shared receptor, has recently entered clinical trials for treatment of high-grade gliomas (HGG).4 The second receptor, IL13Ra2, is not shared with IL-4, has 27 % identity with IL13Ra1, is over-expressed in several cancers (including HGGs), and has been characterized as a cancer testes antigen (CTA).5 IL13Ra2 is believed to be non-signaling and may serve as a ``decoy'' receptor.5,6 The decoy characteristic is supported by the discovery of a soluble receptor, homologous to IL13Ra2, found in both the serum and urine of mice.6 Interestingly, a highly malignant HGG, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), has been found to express predominantly the non-shared receptor, and an IL-13 mutant has already shown promise for radioimmunodetection and radioimmunotherapy.7,8 Recently, IL-13 has been implicated as a regulator of tumor immunosurveillance.9 IL-13 also plays a role in a number of other diseases, such as asthma, leishmaniasis, and helminthic infections.10,11 Thus, IL-13 and the IL-13/receptor complexes provide attractive targets for structure-based drug design.

232 IL-13 has been categorized as a member of the short-chain (Sc) cytokines, which includes GMCSF, IL-2, IL-3, and IL-4, as compared to the longchain (Lc) cytokines that include hGH, IL-6, IL-12, G-CSF, and LIF. IL-13 has 25 % sequence identity with IL-4 and contains two of the three disul®des present in IL-4;12-14 hence, it has been presumed to adopt a four-helix bundle motif with an up-updown-down topology (termed helices A, B, C, and D). The high helical content predicted for IL-13 was con®rmed by circular dichroism.13 ± 15 Recently, we reported the secondary structural elements of IL-13 to be four helices spanning residues 10-21 (helix A), 43-52 (helix B), 61-69 (helix C), and 92110 (helix D), along with two b-strands spanning residues 33-36 and 87-90.16 Mutational studies have indicated several IL-13 residues that may be involved in the IL4Ra interface.17 However, little is known about the interface between IL-13 and IL13Ra1 in the shared receptor or between IL-13 and IL13Ra2 in the non-shared receptor.17,18 For clinical purposes, efforts have already begun to engineer IL-13 mutants with higher af®nity to its receptor than wild type IL-13, yet progress has been hampered by the inability to determine the positions of important residues accu-

rately within the context of the three-dimensional structure.17 ± 19 Here, we report the NMR solution structure of human IL-13. The structure of IL-13 is con®rmed to be a four-helix bundle with an overall structure similar to that of IL-4.20 ± 22 Additionally, we use this structure and the recently determined X-ray crystal structure of the IL-4/IL4Ra1 complex23 to interpret available mutational studies and identify potentially critical residues involved in IL-13/receptor engagement.17,18

IL-13 Solution Structure
The solution structure of IL-13 is shown as a stereo superposition in Figure 1(a). It exhibits a high degree of similarity to IL-4 as shown in Figure 1(b) and (c), illustrating the predicted upup-down-down four-helix-bundle topology. The IL-13 solution structure differs from an earlier homology model19 that failed to correctly pair the cysteine residues into two disul®de bonds, resultÊ ing in a rather poor r.m.s.d. of 5.9 A over helices A, B, C, and D. In the solution structure, helix A of IL-13 is de®ned to include residues 7-21, which is slightly extended from our previous report.16 The longer helix is supported by NOEs and backbone

233 is presented in Table 2. The small differences in interhelical angles may, in part, be due to the extra disul®de bond in IL-4, which connects helices A and D. However, all of these differences are less than 14  . A structural alignment of the lowestenergy IL-13 structure with the IL-4 crystal structure,21 using the Dali algorithm,25 yields an Ê r.m.s.d. over the backbone atoms of 2.5 A over 90 residues. The three-dimensional structural alignment is shown in Figure 3(a) and (b) and the corresponding sequence and secondary structure alignments are presented in Figure 3(c). The conserved Cys residues comprising the two disul®de bonds (C29-C57 and C45-C71) are also highlighted. The anti-parallel b-sheet in IL-13, which is located similarly to the b-sheet in IL-4, connects the ABloop and CD-loop, and is stabilized via the hydrogen bond between Val34 and Ile90. This short bsheet is found in all but one of the Sc cytokine structures determined to date (IL-3 has a slightly altered topology26), and is found, to a lesser extent, in Lc cytokines.27 The overall topology of IL-13 is similar to that of IL-4 and other helical cytokines, with the most sig-

dihedral angles determined from chemical shifts. The structure is determined to high precision Ê (r.m.s.d. of 0.55 A for the backbone atoms of the helices), and the structural statistics are presented in Table 1. There was no NOE violation greater Ê than 0.21 A. Those segments of the structure with lower precision (1-6, 24-27, 76-88, and 111-113), see Figure 2(a), were found to correspond to regions having lower heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE values of 0.55 Æ 0.15, as compared to values of 0.73 Æ 0.09 for the ordered regions that were composed primarily of the helices (Figure 2(b)). The lower values of heteronuclear NOEs indicates conformational ¯exibility and genuine disorder, and this ¯exibility is supported by the inability to observe the HN amide resonances of Ser81 and Ser82 due to exchange broadening. Complete relaxation data (T1, T2, and NOE at 500 and 600 MHz, data not shown) reveal dynamics that re¯ect effects qualitatively similar to those seen for the AB and CD loops in IL-4.24 The details of these effects will be discussed elsewhere.

ni®cant differences in the lengths of the helices. While helices A and D are of similar lengths for both cytokines, helices B and C of IL-13 are approximately half the length of the corresponding helices in IL-4. A comparison to other Sc cytokines for which structures have been determined (GMCSF, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, and IL-5) reveals that helix B of GM-CSF is similar in length to helices B and C of IL-13.28 Unlike IL-4, GM-CSF shares little identity with IL-13, and these two proteins do not share any known receptor, but all three cytokines are found in close proximity on the same chromosome in humans and mice.1 This suggests that

evolutionary sequence divergence followed gene duplication. Several other elements common to the Sc cytokines29 are conserved in IL-13. Like other cytokines, the helices of IL-13 contain numerous residues that contribute to its hydrophobic core, several of which are highly conserved.12,30 These include Leu17 on helix A and Phe95 at the N-terminal segment of helix D that are both conserved across most of the Sc cytokines. A conserved Thr located at the N terminus of helix D in IL-2, IL-4, M-CSF, and GM-CSF is found in a similar position, Thr88, in IL-13. Also, an exposed acidic residue

Insights into Receptor Interfaces
The crystal structure of IL-4 bound to IL4Ra23 and the mutagenesis data currently available for both IL-4 and IL-13, can be used to postulate interactions in IL-13/receptor engagement. Since both IL-13 and IL-4 will bind the shared receptor, IL4Ra/IL13Ra1, it is reasonable to examine whether IL-13 presents a similar surface to this receptor as IL-4 presents to IL4Ra. Studies of the IL-4/IL4Ra complex have shown that Glu9 on helix A and Arg88 on helix C are the largest contributors to the binding free energy.31 Glu9 of IL-4 forms numerous hydrogen bonds to IL4Ra, and Arg88 forms a salt-bridge to Asp72 of IL4Ra. These residues are conserved in IL-13 as Glu12 and Arg65, respectively, and mutations of either residue result in reduced signaling in the shared receptor but have no effect on the af®nity of IL-13 for the non-shared receptor, IL-13Ra2.8,17,32 Furthermore, Arg85 in IL-4, which is analogous to Lys62 of IL-13, has been found to be important in complex formation. Thus, this cluster of charged residues found at the interface of IL-4/IL4Ra on helices A and C (Glu9, Arg85, and Arg88) is conserved in IL-13 (Glu12, Lys62, and Arg65) as shown in Figure 4(a) and (b). The conservation of these residues support at least some features of a common epitope for the IL-13 and IL-4 interaction with IL4Ra.

IL-13 has no measurable af®nity for IL4Ra in the absence of IL13Ra1,33 hence there must also be some differences in the binding determinants between the two cytokines and IL4Ra. The surface of IL-13 presumed to interact with IL4Ra by comparison to IL-4 in the receptor complex exhibits a signi®cantly different electrostatic surface potential in IL-13 compared to IL-4 (Figure 4(c)-(f)). IL-13 contains more acidic residues at the interface than IL-4, e.g. Glu15 and Glu16 in IL-13 compared to Lys12 and Thr13 in IL-4. This interface may result in an electrostatically unfavorable interaction between IL-13 and IL4Ra or loss of hydrogen bonds to IL4Ra (vide infra) thus increasing the binding free energy. The Glu15/Glu16 surface of IL-13 would not have to interact directly with IL4Ra (Figures 4(e)-(f), and 5) to affect binding, because the charge of the adjacent positive cluster formed by Lys62 and Arg65 would be partially shielded or neutralized, resulting in a smaller net attraction to IL4Ra. In order for IL-13 to bind IL4Ra/IL13Ra1, Glu15 of IL-13 may engage in salt-bridge contacts with IL13Ra1, reducing the unfavorable charge interaction and allow subsequent binding to IL4Ra. These putative interactions are illustrated by positioning IL-13 in the receptor complex via a superposition of IL-13 upon the position of IL-4 in the IL-4/IL4Ra structure (Figure 5(a)). The importance of the proposed repulsive interactions is supported by mutagenesis data, where IL-13 E15K was found to be more active than wild type IL-13.17 This mutation makes IL-13 more like IL-4, therefore increasing its af®nity

to IL4Ra. The implication is that position 15 of IL13, which is analogous to position 12 of IL-4, may interact with different receptors depending upon the charge of the amino acid present. This conclusion is supported by the close spatial proximity of the interactions with the different receptors (vide infra). For completeness, it should be pointed out, however, that adjustment for differences in charge may come about by conformational changes in the receptor complex. Another set of interactions at the IL-4/IL4Ra interface highlight residues that can be compared

with those in IL-13. In the IL-4/IL4Ra crystal structure, Glu9 of IL-4 forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond to Asn89 that stabilizes its orientation and may facilitate complex formation (Figure 5(b)). Murine IL-4 also has a hydrogen bonding partner (i.e. Ser) at the position analogous to Asn89; however, this is not the case for either human or murine IL-13 (Figure 5(a)), where the analogous residue is hydrophobic (Met66 and Ile68, respectively). Additionally, Lys12 and Thr6 of IL-4 form intermolecular hydrogen bonds from their sidechains to the IL4Ra receptor. These hydrogen bonds cannot be maintained by IL-13, which has Glu15 and Ala9 at the analogous positions. Thus, several residues critical to IL-4/IL4Ra complex stability are not conserved between IL-13 and IL-4, explaining the lower af®nity of IL-13 for IL4Ra. Little information exists about the binding region formed between IL-13 and either IL13Ra1 or IL13Ra2. Both IL-4 and IL-2 initiate signaling events by binding to shared receptors involving gc, via residues on the surface formed by helices A and D. Analysis of mutational data and a comparison of these surfaces of IL-13, IL-4, and IL-2 may therefore help to elucidate speci®c residues involved in the IL-13 interface with IL13Ra1 or IL13Ra2 (Figure 6). A mutation on IL-4 of Arg121 to either Asp or Glu results in a loss of binding to the IL4Ra/IL13Ra1 shared receptor, but retains af®nity to IL4Ra/gc.34,35 Thus, Arg121 is important for the interaction of IL-4 with IL13Ra1, and this basic charge is conserved in IL-13 as Lys104. A mutation of either Tyr124 of IL-4 or Arg108 of IL-13, positioned analogously at the C terminus of helix D in both structures, to Asp disrupts signaling in cells that express IL4Ra/IL13Ra1. In the case of IL-4, Y124D was found to retain binding to IL4Ra, while in the case of IL-13, R108D failed to signal through the IL4Ra/IL13Ra1 receptor complex or to bind to IL13Ra2.17,36 Thus, position 108 in IL-13 and 124 in IL-4, occupied by two very different types of amino acids, is essential for each respective cytokine-receptor binding complex. In the case of IL-13, the binding interface interacts with either IL13Ra1 or IL13Ra2, while in the case of both IL-4 and IL-2 it interacts with gc.1 Examination of mutation data in the context of the IL-4 structure has revealed a cluster of uncharged residues in IL-4, de®ned by Ile11, Asn15, Tyr124, and Ser125, that are important for binding to the gc receptor.37 There is a homologous cluster of residues, Leu18, Gln22, Ile129, and Ser130 in the structure of IL-2.38 In IL-13, there are several charged residues, Arg108 and Glu109, in the analogous cluster positions (Figure 6) that would alter the electrostatic potential of this surface. This may explain why IL-13 does not bind to gc. Few mutations of IL-13 (R108D being the only known exception, vide supra) have affected its binding to the non-shared, GMB-associated receptor, IL13Ra2. It is interesting to note that a chimeric cytotoxin composed of either the IL-13 mutant

E12K or E12Y has been found to target this nonshared receptor better than IL4Ra/IL13Ra1.8,39 Since Glu12 most likely comprises part of the binding epitope for IL4Ra and Arg108 is implicated in the binding epitope for both IL13Ra1 and IL13Ra2, the binding epitope for IL13Ra2 may be coincident with both interfaces. Future mutational studies, based on the structure of IL-13, may help to delineate this interface further.

Conclusions
In summary, we have determined the high-resolution NMR structure of IL-13. The overall fold is similar to that of IL-4 and other Sc cytokines, consisting of a four-helix bundle with the characteristic up-up-down-down topology that includes a bsheet formed between residues in the AB-loop and CD-loop. Segments with low precision (high r.m.s.d. values) corresponded well with lower values of heteronuclear NOEs, indicating that these regions are generally ¯exible in solution. Although several residues of IL-13 are positioned analogously to critical residues of IL-4 that interact with

the shared receptor components IL4Ra (i.e. Glu12, Lys62, and Arg65) and IL13Ra1 (i.e. Lys104), there are several signi®cant differences. The variations result in very different electrostatic surface potential that may explain the relative af®nities of IL-13 and IL-4 for the subunits of the shared receptor complex. These differences include Ala9, Glu15, and Glu16 of IL-13 that are unable to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with IL4Ra, as compared to Thr6, Lys12, and Thr13 of IL-4.23 Some of these interactions can be viewed in the context of the receptor, as shown in Figure 7. Several charged residues from both cytokines are positioned to form similar contacts with IL4Ra, and residues such as Glu15, Lys104, and Arg108 of IL-13, and Arg121 and Tyr124 of IL-4 are positioned to generate an exposed surface (Figure 7(c) and (d)) that could bind to IL13Ra1. The determination of the solution structure of IL-13 enables an interpretation of most of the mutational studies to date. The structure may aid in the design of further mutagenesis experiments aimed at using this cytokine as a potential drug, while future solution studies with soluble receptor components may aid in the design of small-molecule antagonists.40

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation IL-13, corresponding to the processed, mature, human protein, was expressed as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein (MBP) and cleaved in vivo by constitutively expressed tobacco etch virus protease. The cleaved protein formed into inclusion bodies that were processed to yield pure, refolded protein as described.13 This previous work indicated that inclusion bodies from a 1 l growth in M9 minimal medium could be solubilized in denaturant and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (2.6 cm diameter x 60 cm length). Although the resolution from this column was suf®cient for both unlabeled and 15N-labeled protein, it was poor for 13C,15N-labeled protein. This unexpected result was overcome by reducing the amount of material loaded onto the column ($0.5 l growth). The yield of pure, isotopically labeled human IL-13 was approximately 3-4 mg/l of M9 minimal medium. Samples for NMR experiments were approximately 1 mM in IL-13 and were prepared in 25 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 6.1), 50 mM NaCl, 0.01 % (w/v) NaN3, 1 mM EDTA. The solvent was either 95 % H2O/5 % 2H2O or 99 % 2H2O as appropriate.

NMR spectroscopy and resonance assignments
1 H, 13C, and 15N assignments16 were made using a combination of experiments acquired using 13C,15N- and 15 N-labeled samples collected on Varian Unity-plus 500 MHz or 600 MHz spectrometers (Palo Alto, CA). We have assigned 95 % of the side-chain resonances, including 60 % of the aromatic resonances. Stereospeci®c assignments along with side-chain restraints for Hb resonances were determined by a qualitative comparison of intensities in the 3D HNHB and HN(CO)HB.41 Methyl groups from a total of 21 of the combined 22 residues were stereospeci®cally assigned by the method of Neri et al.42 The protonation state of the three histidine residues was determined using the two-bond coupling pattern observed in a modi®ed HSQC experiment.43 Distance restraints were determined using NOEs derived from a 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC with tmix  150 ms, a simultaneous 13C and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC with tmix  120 ms, a 3D 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC in 2H2O with tmix  100 ms, a 4D 13C,15N HMQC-NOESY-HSQC with tmix  120 ms, and a 4D 13C,13C HMQC-NOESYHSQC with tmix  100 ms.44 Heteronuclear 1H-15N NOEs were measured at a 1H resonance frequency of 600 MHz using the pulse sequence reported by Farrow et al.45 Spectra were processed using NMRPipe software46 and analyzed using Ansig 3.3 software.47

IL-13 Structure and Receptor Interfaces Structure calculations Structure calculations were performed using CNS version 1.0 with an all-hydrogen force-®eld (proteinallhdg.param and protein-allhdg.top).48 Hydrogen bond restraints for helical segments were used only for those residues determined unambiguously to be within helices by both the chemical shift index (CSI)49 and TALOS.50 In addition, hydrogen bond restraints were added between Val34 and Ile90 upon evaluation of preliminary calculated structures that revealed the close proximity of their respective amino and carboxyl groups. These two amide protons have a deuterium exchange half-life of over ®ve hours, which supports their involvement in a strong hydrogen bond (data not shown). Torsion-angle molecular dynamics using CNS, beginning from an extended strand, were employed using a modi®cation of the protocol described by Stein et al.51 Following 1000 steps of Powell minimization of the extended strand, four steps were employed as follows: (1) torsion-angle molecular dynamics heating consisting of 4000 steps of 0.015 ps increments at 40,000 K using a distance restraining force constant, kdist, and a hydrogen bond force constant, Ê kHbond, of 100 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2, a dihedral force constant, kcdih, of 200 kcal molÀ1 radÀ2, and a van der Waals scaling factor, svdW, of 0.1; (2) torsion-angle molecular dynamics cooling consisting of 2000 steps of 0.015 ps increments beginning at 10,000 K and cooled to 300 K, kdist and kHbond increased linearly from 100 kcal molÀ1 Ê Ê AÀ2 to 200 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2, kcdih of 200 kcal molÀ1 radÀ2, and svdW increased linearly from 0.1 to 0.5; (3) Cartesian molecular dynamics cooling consisting of 1000 steps of 0.001 ps increments beginning at 300 K and cooled to Ê 100 K, kdist increased from 200 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 to Ê 400 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2, kcdih of 200 kcal molÀ1 radÀ2, and svdW increased from 1.0 to 4.0; (4) Powell minimization consisting of 15,000 steps with kdist and kHbond equal to Ê 200 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2, kcdih of 5 kcal molÀ1 radÀ2, and svdW equal to 4.0. The force constant for the two disul®de bonds was set to zero for the torsion-angle molecular Ê dynamics and set to 1000 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 during Cartesian molecular dynamics and minimization. After an initial round of calculations using 1447 unambiguous distance restraints (80 long-range, i À j > 4), ARIA52 calculations were implemented with an additional 449 ambiguous distance restraints, using the following criteria for nine iterations (P values are listed ®rst followed by the assignment cutoff distance in parentheses): 0.999 (10), 0.999 (5), 0.99 (2), 0.99 (1), 0.98 (0.5), 0.96 (0.25), 0.93 (0.25), 0.90 (0.20), 0.8 (0.20). Fifty structures were calculated for each round and the ten with the lowest total energies were used for the following iteration. After nine iterations of ARIA, a total of 1668 unambiguous NOEs (179 long-range), 62 ambiguous NOEs, 58 pairs of f,j torsion angles, 32 side-chain dihedral restraints, 36 hydrogen bond restraints, and two disul®de bond restraints (29-57 and 45-71)12,13 were used in a ®nal set of calculations to generate 200 structures. Good convergence was found and the 20 lowest-energy structures were chosen for further analysis. Data deposition Resonance assignments have been deposited in the BMRB (accession code 4843). The coordinates have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (accession code 1GA3). #US Government
