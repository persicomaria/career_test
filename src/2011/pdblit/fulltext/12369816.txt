ABSTRACT: The three-dimensional structure of the precursor form of the Arabidopsis thaliana trypsin inhibitor (ATTp, GenBank entry Z46816), a 68-residue (7.5 kDa) rapeseed class proteinase inhibitor, has been determined in solution at pH 5.0 and 25 °C by multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The protein contains one R-helix and two strands of antiparallel -sheet, with a type IV -turn connecting the two strands. The R-helix and the inhibitory loop are connected to the -sheet through three disulfide bridges; a fourth disulfide bridge connects the N- and C-termini. The overall structural topology of ATTp is similar to those of the sweet tasting protein brazzein (rmsd of 3.0 Å) and the antifungal protein RsAfp1 [a knottin protein from radish (Raphanus satiVus), rmsd of 2.7 Å]. The precursor segment in ATTp is disordered, as visualized by the final 20-conformer ensemble and as confirmed by 15N heteronuclear NOE analysis. The overall fold of ATTp is distinct from those of other classes of serine proteinase inhibitors except in the inhibitor loop; therefore, it represents a new inhibitor fold.

Genomic DNA sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant from the mustard family (1-3), revealed a group of isogenes (ATT isogenes) that belong (Figure 1) to the recently described rapeseed class of serine proteinase inhibitors, which includes MTI-21 purified from white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) seed (4) and RTI purified from oil rape (Brassica napus var. oieifera) seed (5). MTI-2 and RTI each inhibit trypsin

and, at 1000-fold lower affinity, chymotrypsin. The physiological functions of this new class of serine proteinase inhibitors have not been fully explored. Because both RTIIII and MTI-2 and related proteins are found in plant seeds, Ryan speculated that they may regulate endogenous proteinases during seed dormancy and serve as a storage source of protein (6). The function of MTI-2 under certain circumstances has been attributed to plant defense (7, 8). The ATT gene sequences encode N-terminal protein extensions that presumably are removed in the mature inhibitors as with MTI-2 (9). The precursor sequences of different ATT genes have slight differences; these may modulate protein maturation through the endoplasmic reticulum and lead to differential targeting within the organism (10). The rapeseed class is one of a few serine proteinase inhibitor families for which a representative tertiary structure has not been reported (11). The reactive site loop in this class of inhibitors contains a unique P3-P3 sequence (-CysAla-Pro-Arg-Ile-Phe/Tyr-Pro-) and cysteine as the P6 residue (Figure 2). The primary sequence of this inhibitor contains eight conserved cysteine residues that form a disulfide arrangement similar to that seen in brazzein and a subgroup of knottin proteins (Q. Zhao, Y. K. Chae, M. M. Vestling, and J. L. Markley, manuscript in preparation). It has been difficult to obtain homogeneous samples of rapeseed inhibitors from natural sources because the plants produce multiple forms of the protein (12, 13). Efforts have been made toward recombinant production of MTI-2, the rapeseed-type inhibitor from white mustard (S. alba L.), either by itself in Pichia pastoris (10) or as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli (14, 15). However, no complete structural description of any rapeseed inhibitor has been reported. As described here, we have

observed for the high-pH conformer of the Ascaris class of serine proteinase inhibitors. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Taq DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase were from Promega. Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Porcine pancreatic trypsin type IX, proteinase substrates N-R-benzoyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide (BNPNA) and 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate (MUGB), citric acid, K2HPO4, and NaH2PO4 were from Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). HPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol were from Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA), and HPLCgrade trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was from Pierce (Rockford, IL). E. coli strain XL1Blue was used for DNA transformation and for routine plasmid storage. 15NH4Cl, [13C]glucose, and [13C]methanol were from Isotech, Inc. (Miamisburg, OH). DNA Synthesis and Sequencing. Oligonucleotides used as primers were synthesized at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. DNA sequencing was carried out at the Biotechnology Center with an ABI Prism automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Plasmid Constructions and Site-Directed Mutagenesis for ATTp Production in E. coli. The original A. thaliana genomic DNA clone, BAC vector T1o024, containing ITI3 (GenBank entry AJ249958), an isogene of ATT, was used as the template in PCR amplification reactions. This gene was cloned into an expression system that led to the production of ATTp as a fusion with staphylococcal nuclease with an engineered cyanogen bromide cleavage site. Protein Production in E. coli. ATTp was produced from E. coli cultures and labeled with 15N and/or 13C for NMR investigations. Full details will be published elsewhere. MALDI MS Analysis of ATT. The molecular mass of purified ATTp was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center.

produced the putative precursor form of the inhibitor (ATTp) heterologously in E. coli. Truncated forms of the inhibitor (ATTm and ATTm+4) lacking the precursor sequence have been produced in P. pastoris. We have carried out chemical shift assignments for ATTp (1H, 13C, and 15N), ATTm+4 (1H and 15N), and ATTm (1H, 15N, and 13C) and have determined that the three forms of the protein have very similar threedimensional structures (Q. Zhao, Y. K. Chae, M. M. Vestling, and J. L. Markley, manuscript in preparation). We report here the solution structure of ATTp, the first three-dimensional structure of a member of the rapeseed family of serine proteinase inhibitors. The overall fold of ATTp is similar to those of CSR proteins and a subgroup of knottins. The conformation of the reactive site loop, although slightly noncanonical, is similar to the novel form

12286 Biochemistry, Vol. 41, No. 41, 2002 the chromogenic substrate N-R-benzoyl-L-arginine p-nitroanilide (BNPNA) (16). Trypsin activity was determined with the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl p-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride (MUGB) (17). The Ki of ATTp toward porcine trypsin was calculated as described previously (9). The chymotrypsin activity test was performed on TLCKtreated R-chymotrypsin as previously described, with N-Rbenzoyl-L-leucine p-nitroanilide (BLPNA) as the substrate (16). The inhibitory activities of ATTp toward thrombin, plasmid, and papain were also tested. Full descriptions of these procedures are in the Supporting Information. NMR Spectroscopy. NMR samples contained 1 mM ATTp, 50 mM perdeuterated sodium acetate at pH 5.0, and 0.1 mM DSS. NMR data were collected at 25 °C. The parameters shown in Supporting Information (Table S1) were used to record two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D, respectively) NMR data sets for resonance assignments on Bruker DMX spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance 1 H, 13C, 15N probes and triple-axis pulse field gradients. Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions was achieved by either the States-TPPI (19) or echo/antiecho (20) method. Gradient pulses, as a combination of xand z-gradients at the "magic angle" (21), were used for coherence selection in experiments with sensitivity enhancement (SE) to maximize water suppression. Two-dimensional NOESY spectra with a mixing time of 100 ms were acquired for unlabeled ATTp samples, one dissolved in D2O and one in H2O. Two data sets were acquired for [U-15N]ATTp; a 3D 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC (22) data set obtained with a mixing time of 100 ms was used as a source of distance constraints, and an HNHA (23, 24) data set was used in determining 3JHNHR coupling constants, which were used as angular constraints. Tripleresonance 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (25) data sets with mixing times of 80, 100, and 150 ms were acquired for [U-13C,15N]ATTp and were used to obtain additional stereospecific assignments and distance constraints. Pulsed field gradient pulses were applied along the magic angle to suppress the water resonance (21). NMR data were processed with FELIX95 or FELIX98 software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). With threedimensional NMR data sets, the indirect dimension with the least amount of digitization was extended with linear prediction equivalent to the original data size. Time domain convolution was used to remove the residual water signal during processing. A 90°-shifted square sine-bell window function was first applied in each dimension. Then the dimension was zero-filled to the final matrix size, Fourier transformed, and phase corrected. The initial values for incremented delays in the multidimensional experiments were set in a manner that allowed predictable phasing in each dimension and minimized rolling and offset of the baseline (26). All 1H dimensions are referenced to internal DSS, and 13 C and 15N dimensions are referenced indirectly to DSS (27). Processed NMR data were analyzed using the SPARKY [http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/Sparky (28)] and XEASY (29) software packages. Choice of a Temperature for Data Collection. Because fewer cross-peaks than predicted were resolved in the 2D homonuclear spectra of ATTp, we suspected initially that resonances from aromatic side chains overlapped. However, because no additional 1H signals from aromatic rings were

Zhao et al. obtained from analysis of the 3D 13C TOCSY CT-HSQC and NOESY CT-HSQC data sets, we hypothesized that that the signal loss results from line broadening caused by ring flipping of aromatic rings at intermediate rates on the NMR chemical shift time scale. This assumption was confirmed through examination of one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of an ATT sample in 99% D2O collected at different temperatures on a Bruker DMX 500 MHz spectrometer. The best resolution was obtained at 298 K, and signals were seen to broaden at higher or lower temperatures (spectra not shown). Sequence Specific Backbone Assignments of ATTp. HNCA and HN(CO)CA spectra of ATTp were first analyzed to obtain sequential connectivities among 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances (see Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). Data from the HNCO experiment were used in assigning backbone carbonyl carbon signals. The connectivities were verified through analysis of the HNCACB spectrum. The full BMRB statistics for chemical shifts of diamagnetic proteins (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/ref_info/statful.html) were used in distinguishing individual amino acid types, and the following rules were applied in the analysis. (i) No glycine spin system contains a 13C peak. (ii) In serine and threonine spin systems, generally (13C ) > (13CR). (iii) Proline spin systems are characterized by connectivity breaks because they lack an HN atom. Side Chain Assignments. Side chain 13C and 1H resonances of ATTp were assigned by analyzing results from the following experiments: HNCACB, 3D C(CO)NH-SE, H(CCO)NH-SE, HCCH-COSY, and HCCH-TOCSY. The combination of C(CO)NH-SE and HCCH-COSY proved to be very efficient for the unambiguous determination of assignments for side chain 1H-13C units. 3D 15N-separated TOCSY HSQC and 3D HNHA data sets were collected from a sample of [U-15N]ATTp; these experiments provided complementary assignment information and precise proton chemical shift values. Asn and Gln Side Chain Assignments. HNCO and HNCACB data sets collected for ATTp with side chainoptimized delay values were used to confirm assignments to the side chains of the three asparagine and three glutamine residues. Stereospecific Assignments. Stereospecific assignments of prochiral protons were determined in part by methods developed by Wuthrich and co-workers (30, 31). The ¨ procedure is summarized as follows. (i) For proline, the amplitudes of the intraresidue NOE cross-peaks between the R-proton and the two -protons are compared. Since HR is always closer to H 3 than to H 2, the identification is straightforward. (ii) For Asn and Gln, one of the two amide N-H protons is always closer to the peripheral methylene group than the other; therefore, stereospecific assignments can be deduced from a comparison of NOE intensities between the Hs and H 2/ 3 signals (for Asn) or H s and H2/3 signals (for Gln). (iii) The prevalent 1 rotamer and the stereospecific assignments of the H 2/ 3 protons, when separately resolved, can be determined by comparison of 3J coupling values and NOE intensities. Relaxation Data. 1H-15N steady state NOE (htNOE) values were obtained by recording spectra with and without 1 H presaturation with a duration of 3 s (32). The SPARKY (28) software package was used in determining NOE cross-

Biochemistry, Vol. 41, No. 41, 2002 12287 were used to identify additional hydrogen bonds. The arrangement of disulfide bonds consistent with these structures was in full agreement with the pattern determined biochemically (Q. Zhao, Y. K. Chae, M. M. Vestling, and J. L. Markley, manuscript in preparation). The input for subsequent structure determinations included additional constraints for disulfide bonds. The TALOS program (35) was used to generate additional backbone dihedral angle constraints in regions of secondary structure. The NOESY peaks were reinvestigated, and iterative rounds of structure calculations generated the final set of distance constraints. In the following cycles of DYANA calculations, 50 conformers were obtained that satisfied the input restraints. Of these, the 10 conformers with the lowest overall energy were selected for analysis by the programs DYANA and PROCHECK (36), and the programs DYANA1.5 and MOLMOL (37) were used to determine their rmsds. Again, all violated constraints were investigated, and consistently violated constraints (less than 2% of total constraints used in the calculation) were removed. This process was repeated until all the distance and angle restraints produced a set of structures that had no NOE distance violations of >0.3 Å and no dihedral angle violations of >5°. Once the final set of restraints had been obtained, a new family of 50 structures was generated using DYANA1.5; the 20 conformers with the lowest penalty functions were retained for further structural analysis. The mean structure from the final ensemble of conformers was regularized by a 1000-step minimization in DYANA. MOLMOL and PROMOTIF (38) were used in structure visualization and analysis. The regularized mean structure and NMR restraints have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (entry 1JXC). RESULTS ATTp Produced from the E. coli Expression System. The yield of ATTp after the final reverse phase (RP) HPLC purification step (at which the protein eluted as one sharp peak) was 10 mg/L of cell culture. The inhibitory constant (Ki) of ATT against porcine trypsin was 1.15 ( 0.23 nM. ATTp was found to inhibit chymotrypsin and thrombin but not plasmin or papain (details are provided in the Supporting Information). The molecular mass of the ATTp product from MALDITOF MS was 7452 ( 2 Da (within 0.01% of the calculated value of 7443 Da for the monomer); this clearly indicates that the protein is a monomer. The molecular mass determined for [13C,15N]ATTp was 7900 ( 10, which indicates a level of enrichment of more than 99% for each isotope. Extent of the Assignments for ATTp. It was possible to resolve signals and assign chemical shifts to 80% of all the 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclei of ATTp. Stereospecific assignments of H protons for 31 of 47 residues and the side chain amides for two of three Asn residues and two of three Gln residues were obtained through analysis of 15N-NOESY, 15NTOCSY, and 13C-NOESY spectra. Partial assignments for the side chain resonances of seven of seven aromatic residues (two Tyr residues, four Phe residues, and one Trp residue) were achieved through analysis of 2D 1H-NOESY and TOCSY, CT 13C-HSQC, and 3D NOESY CT-HSQC and TOCSY CT-HSQC data sets. Regions of the molecule that remained unassigned are primarily those affected by ex-

where Isat and Iunsat represent the measured intensities of a resonance in the presence and absence, respectively, of proton saturation. Hydrogen Exchange Experiments. A solution of [U-15N]ATTp was lyophilized to dryness and dissolved in 500 µL of H2O. It was lyophilized again and dissolved in 500 µL of 100% D2O. A series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra were collected at 25 °C at different time intervals following the addition of D2O solvent. Residues whose HN-N cross-peaks remained observable after >7 h were classified as having slowly exchanging backbone amide protons. Experimental Restraints and Structure Calculations. The program SPARKY (28) was used in the manual assignment of the 3D 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC spectra and to measure peak intensities. These peak intensities were converted to distance constraints in XPLOR (33) format with a UNIX shell script created by Z. Zolnai in NMRFAM, and corrections for pseudoatoms were added. The above constraints were used subsequently as input to DYANA (34) and converted to DYANA upper limits for later rounds of calculations. 3JHNHR coupling constants calculated from the cross-peak to diagonal-peak intensity ratio in the HNHA experiment were used as follows to constrain backbone dihedral angles: 3JHNHR < 5.5 Hz,  ) -57 ( 20°; 3JHNHR > 7.7 Hz,  ) -139 ( 30°. Hydrogen bond restraints were introduced for backbone amide protons only in cases where the amide proton exchanged slowly, the 3JHNHR coupling constant was small, and medium-range NOEs were consistent with the presence of an R-helix. No disulfide bond restraints were imposed in the initial stages of the structure calculations. The program DYANA1.5, which employs simulated annealing combined with molecular dynamics in torsion angle space (33), was used to generate structural models. An iterative process of calculation was employed in which the results of successive rounds of structure calculations were used to make further NOE assignments. During the initial rounds of structure calculations, 10 000 simulated annealing steps were used to generate each structure; 100 such structures were determined, and among these, the 25 with the lowest target function values were retained for analysis of hydrogen bonds and long-range NOEs. After the initial structures were obtained, we used the ASSIGN function of DYANA to automate NOE assignments from three data sets: the 2D homonuclear NOESY of the sample in H2O, the 2D homonuclear NOESY of the sample in D2O, and the 3D 15N-edited NOESY. Distances derived from the additional NOE peaks were calibrated separately for each data set. The newly generated distance constraints were added into further rounds of structure calculations. All violated constraints were investigated, and consistently violated constraints (never more than 5% of the constraints) were removed. The automated NOE assignment procedure was performed until no new constraints could be generated and no new NOE peaks could be assigned. These structures

12288 Biochemistry, Vol. 41, No. 41, 2002 change broadening. These include the N-terminal residue Cys1, Pro26, the side chains of several aromatic amino acids (Tyr15, Phe21, Phe23, Tyr34, Trp50, and Phe62), and the C , N1, N2, H11, H12, H21, and H22 atoms of the five arginine residues. NMR assignments have been deposited at BMRB (entry 5056). Oxidation State of the Cysteine Residues. An excellent correlation was reported recently between cysteinyl 13CR and 13 C chemical shifts and the oxidation state of the cysteine side chain (39). We have applied the two methods described by these authors to investigate the redox states of the eight cysteines of ATTp that are conserved in all rapeseed inhibitors. Signals were not resolved for the nonconserved cysteine of ATT (Cys1). The first method is based on cysteine 13C chemical shifts. Cysteine residues in which (13C ) > 35 ppm can be classified as oxidized, while cysteine residues in which (13C ) < 32 ppm can be classified as reduced. If only one (13C ) lies in the gray area between 32 and 35 ppm, its oxidation state can be determined by considering the redox states of the other cysteine residues (39). All but one of the eight conserved cysteines in ATTp has a (13C ) of >35 ppm; the remaining conserved cysteine has a (13C ) in the gray area [Cys60 (13C ) ) 34.3 ppm]. The second method for determining the oxidation state of cysteines utilizes the Cys (13C ) and (13CR) chemical shifts as well as the local secondary structure. In a plot of (13C ) versus (13CR) for each cysteine, oxidized and reduced cysteines fall into different regions, which are dependent on the secondary structure in which they are located. The analysis of ATTp shows all conserved Cys residues in the oxidized region, with the exception of Cys60, which is located in an indeterminate area but clearly not in the region of a reduced cysteine (see Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). Thus, we conclude that all eight conserved cysteines participate in disulfide bridges. The following disulfide bridges of ATTm+4, a truncated form of ATT, were subsequently identified by chemical methods: C1-C8, C2-C5, C3-C6, and C4-C7 [where the numbers indicate the order of appearance of the conserved cysteine in the sequence (Q. Zhao, Y. K. Chae, M. M. Vestling, and J. L. Markley, manuscript in preparation)]. These disulfide bond constraints were applied in later rounds of structure calculation. Secondary Structure. Secondary structural elements for ATTp were deduced from the assigned chemical shifts and three-bond J couplings. The consensus chemical shift index (CSI) (40) was determined from the combined experimental 1 R 13 R 13 H , C , C , and 13C chemical shifts (Figure 3). The following rules were applied in deriving secondary structure from J coupling constants. (i) Two or more consecutive 3 JHNHR values of >7.7 Hz imply -strand, and (ii) more than three consecutive 3JHNHR values of <5.0 Hz imply R-helix. The combined results (see Table S2 of the Supporting Information) indicate that ATT contains three -strands, one short helical element, and one R-helix. Alignment of the secondary structural elements of ATT with those of other sequence-related proteins reveals an excellent match to brazzein and the group of scorpion toxins with known structure (Figure 4). A similar alignment of the secondary structural elements of ATT with those of snake venom toxins and epidermal growth factors domains with known structure (Figure 4) shows much less agreement. From this compari-

son, it appears to be clear that ATT is structurally distinct from snake venom toxins and epidermal growth factors. The pattern of dRN(i, i + 3) and dR (i, i + 3) connectivities (Figure 5) identified the presence of an R-helix. A series of strong dRN sequential connectivities, together with the pattern of slowly exchanging amide hydrogens, led to elucidation of the -strands. A short 310-helix (residues 21-24) was suggested by dRN(i, i + 2) connectivities, 3JHNR values, and TALOS predictions; however, although observed in a few of the final structures, the 310-helix was not present in the final minimized mean structure. Residues 12-15, which correspond to a -strand in brazzein and a subgroup of knottin proteins, were found not to adopt a -strand conformation in ATT. Comparisons of Chemical Shifts of ATTp with Those of Other Proteins. CSR proteins contain a C1,,C2-XXX-C3,, G-X-C4,,C5-X-C6 motif. The 1HR resonances of the G, C4, C5, and C6 residues within this motif are deshielded by the proximity of the disulfide bridges between C2 and C5 and between C3 and C6 (26). To compare the chemical shifts of ATTp with those of other CSR proteins for which NMR data are available, we calculated the deviations of the 1HR chemical shifts from the standard random coil values used in CSI analysis (40), which are available from the BMRB website (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/ref_info/csishift.txt). The secondary 1HR chemical shifts of the cysteines of ATT were compared with those of the sequence-aligned cysteines of snake venom toxins and EFG-like domains (see Figure S3 of the Supporting Information). Whereas seven of eight cysteines of the three snake venom toxins in the comparison exhibit very similar 1HR chemical shifts, only two of the cysteines of ATT have comparable chemical shifts. Because it had been proposed that the first six cysteine residues of ATT have the same disulfide pairing topology as EGF domains (12), we compared the secondary chemical shifts of these six cysteines; however, the dissimilarity of the chemical shift patterns failed to support this hypothesis (see Figure S3 of the Supporting Information). Structure Calculations. More than 500 1H-15N NOESY cross-peaks, assigned manually with the program SPARKY (28), yielded 438 unique DYANA upper limit constraints.

The PDB codes (italic) for the tertiary structures and BMRB accession numbers (bold) for the chemical shift assignments are as follows: (1) ATT (5056), (4) brazzein (1BRZ and 4067), (5) charybdoxin (2CRD and 114), (6) pandinotoxin (1C49 and 4760), (7) toxin 2 from Centruroides noxius hoffmann (1CN2 and 4218), (8) Centruroides sculpturatus Ewing toxin I (1B3C and 4279), (9) cardiotoxin II (1CRE and 1376), (10) cardiotoxin III (2CRS), (11) toxin FS2 (1TFS), (12) cardiotoxin A3 (4966), (13) murine epidermal growth factor (1EGF and 2201), (14) fibrilin (two domains) (1EMO), and (15) the EGF domain of protein S (4728) (chemical shift assignments are available for both major and minor conformational forms of the protein).

A total of 20  and  angle constraints were obtained from analyzing 3JHNHR data; 14 of these were within the R-helix segment (Ile32-Glu39). The R-helical segment was further verified by the slow exchange of amide protons for residues Thr35-Glu39 and by dRN(i, i + 3) connectivities deduced from NOE cross-peaks. Therefore, eight hydrogen bond constraints (four upper and four lower limits) were used in the initial calculations for the R-helical region (residues 32-39). The initial structures were investigated to identify hydrogen bonds in the -sheet structure. These observations were compared with amino acid sequence alignments and were verified by hydrogen exchange measurements; hydrogen bond constraints for the -sheet were added in later rounds of structure refinement. After iteration of the structure calculations and NOE assignments, we obtained initial structures that suggested disulfide bridges between Cys11 and Cys63 and between Cys24 and Cys48. In addition, we observed H -H NOE cross-peaks linking Cys11 to Cys63, Cys24 to Cys48, and Cys37 to Cys60. These results confirmed those of an independent mass spectrometric study of proteolytic fragments ATTm+4, a truncated version of ATT that lacks the precursor sequence (Q. Zhao, Y. K. Chae, M. V. Vestling, and J. L. Markley, manuscript in preparation). Constraints for the Si-Sj and SiC j distances of each of the four disulfide bonds (12 upper limit and 12 lower limit restraints) were added in the final

Hydrogen Bonds. Slowly exchanging amide hydrogens were identified at positions 13, 15, 35-39, 43, 45, 47, and 59-61. With the exception of residue 13, all hydrogen bond acceptors were identified (Table 2). In seven of the 20 final structures, a hydrogen bond was indicated between residues 41 and 43 within the type IV -turn (residues 40-43). However, this hydrogen bond was not indicated in the minimized mean structure. All hydrogen bonds within the R-helical region were identified. The hydrogen bonds forming the antiparallel -sheet and the observed NOEs supporting this secondary structure are shown in Figure 7. Order and Dynamics. Well-defined backbone torsion angles (angular order parameter S > 0.8) were observed within or adjacent to the regions of recognizable secondary structure (Ile32-Asn40, Lys44-Arg49, and Cys56-Cys62) and in other residues with low rmsd values and large numbers of distance constraints (Figure 7B-E). Regions with poorly defined backbone torsion angles included the precursor peptide (Cys1-Ala6), the three residues at the C-terminus (residues 65-67), and the connecting loop regions (residues 7, 8, 17, 41-43, and 50-52); these regions exhibited S angular order parameters of <0.6 (for  and/or ) and larger rmsd values (2.25 ( 0.60 Å for the backbone and 2.88 ( 0.59 Å for heavy atoms). The rmsd values for the inhibitor loop (residues 24-30) were 1.17 ( 0.44 Å for backbone and 2.34 ( 0.76 Å for heavy atoms. In the inhibitory loop, residues Cys24 (P4) to Arg27 (P1) yielded low angular order parameters, whereas residues Ile28 (P1) to Pro30 (P3) were better ordered (angular order parameter S > 0.7). The C-terminal residue (Gln68), which was constrained by few medium- and long-range NOEs, exhibited a moderate angular order parameter (S ) 0.63); the rmsd values for backbone and heavy atoms at this position were >3 Å. The internal mobility of ATTp was investigated by measuring 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE (ht-NOE) values for most of the backbone hydrogen and nitrogen atoms. Negative ht-NOE values were obtained for residues 3-6; such values are indicative of large amplitude motions (on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale) and a lack of defined structure (32). Residues with below average htNOE values (indicative of higher mobility) included the region immediately adjacent to the precursor sequence (Gln7-Cys11), the reactive site P1 residue (Ile28), the residues connecting the two -strands (Gly53-Asn55), and residues near the C-terminus (Asp65, Thr66, and Gln68) (Figure 7A). DISCUSSION Characteristics of the ATTp Structure. As determined by the program PROMOTIF (38) (Figure 6B), ATTp contains one R-helix (residues 31-39) and an antiparallel -sheet in a -hairpin conformation, which consists of two -strands (residues 45-48 and 58-61) connected by a type IV -turn (residues 52-55). The putative reactive site loop is solventexposed, with the P1 residue (Arg27) pointing outward to the solvent (Figure 6C). The side chains of the aromatic residues are mostly exposed to solvent (Figure 6D). The structure is

refinement stages. The TALOS program was used to generate additional backbone dihedral angle constraints from chemical shifts within individual secondary structural elements. The final refinement made use of 953 upper limit constraints derived from NOE data (155 long-range, 123 medium-range, 286 short-range, and 389 intraresidue). This corresponds to an average of 14 restraints per residue. The NOE-derived restraints were supplemented by 26 upper limit constraints (14 for hydrogen bonds and 12 for disulfide bonds), 26 lower limit constraints (14 for hydrogen bonds and 12 for disulfide bonds), and 32 dihedral angle ( and ) constraints. In the absence of lower bound disulfide constraints, several Cys S atoms were too close to each other. Structure Validation. Structural statistics are summarized in the Supporting Information (Table S3). The average value of the DYANA target function was 1.10 ( 0.17 Å. This indicates that the family of conformers agrees well with the experimental constraints. The minimized mean structure had a target function value of 1.15 Å. For residues 10-64, the average pairwise rmsd between the minimized structure and members of the 20-structure ensemble of conformers was 1.08 ( 0.31 Å for backbone atoms and 1.85 ( 0.42 Å for all heavy atoms. Ramachandran plot analysis of residues 7-67 of the ensemble of 20 conformers showed that 54% of the nonglycyl residues fall into the most favored regions of torsion angle space, 28% of the residues are in other allowed regions, and 15% of the residues fall in the generously allowed region. All residues in the secondary structural elements of ATTp lie in the allowed regions of torsion angle space. Eight residues (25, 27, 28, 31, 41, 43, 52, and 54) were found to be in disallowed regions in at least one of the 20 conformers (see Figure S4 of the Supporting Information). Few mediumor long-range constrains were found for residues 25, 27 (the P1 residue of the reactive site), 28 (the P1 residue of the reactive site), 41 (loop), and 52 (loop). Most of these residues have low angular order parameters (S < 0.5) for backbone dihedral angles (S or S) and high standard deviations for angles  and/or  (Table 1). Residues 27, 52, and 54 also have below average htNOE values (Figure 7A). Interestingly, almost all of these residues (except Ile28) are located adjacent to a Pro or Gly residue. For residues 10-64, the ensemble of conformers representing the ATTp structure (Figure 6A) has an average rmsd with respect to mean structure values of 0.91 ( 0.25 Å for backbone atoms and 1.54 ( 0.28 Å for all heavy atoms. For the most structured regions (residues 12-15, 32-29, 45-48, and 58-61), average rmsd values with respect to the mean structure were 0.42 ( 0.14 Å for

stabilized by four disulfide bonds; the solvent accessibilities of the eight cysteines that form these linkages are lower than average. The internal mobility of ATTp was probed by analyzing the angular order parameters, the backbone rmsd values, and the htNOE data (Figure 7A-D). The regions of secondary structure are all well-defined, whereas the connecting loop regions and the precursor sequence are less ordered. Comparison with Other Structures. When we determined the structure of brazzein, we predicted on the basis of sequence alignments that ATT might be structurally similar to the family of CSR proteins (41; Figure 8A). The structure presented here confirms this hypothesis. The ATTp sequence is also similar to those of a subgroup of knottin proteins (represented by Rs-Afp1). The rmsd value calculated with the

DALI software package (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/) between ATTp and brazzein (PDB entry 2BRZ, 28% identical and 38% homologous in primary sequence to ATTp) was 3.0 Å; that between ATTp and Rs-Afp1 (PDB entry 1AYJ, 28% identical and 36% homologous in primary sequence to ATTp) was 2.7 Å. Within the regions of secondary structure, the similarity was still higher: 2.2 Å between ATTp and brazzein and 1.9 Å between ATTp and Rs-Afp. We also superimposed the structure of ATTp (minimized mean structure) with those of five related plant proteins (PDB entries 1AYJ, 1MYN, 1GPT, 1BRZ, and 1BK8) using the best structure from each ensemble in the case of NMR structures. The superposition (Figure 8B) resulted in a good alignment of secondary structures. The major differences among the structures were in loop 1 connecting the first

conserved -strand to the beginning of the R-helix (residues 16-30 in ATTp) and loop 3 connecting the second and third conserved -strands (a third strand was not observed in

ATTp). It has been suggested that these two regions are important for the antifungal and receptor binding activity of Rs-Afp (42). Furthermore, homologues of Rs-Afp that lack antifungal activity show the largest sequence divergence from Rs-Afp in these two regions (43). The largest structural differences between the two families of plant defensins exemplified by Ah-Amp1 (1BK8) and Rs-Afp are observed in these regions and have been implicated in their different functional activities (44). In the case of brazzein, singleamino acid substitutions of several residues in these two regions decreased its sweetness (45). In ATTp, the reactive site (residues 25-30) is located in loop 1, which connects the first conserved -strand of the CSR fold to the beginning of the R-helix. Therefore, the differential activities and specificities of homologous CSR proteins of plant origin may reside in these regions. We also compared the topologies of the disulfide bonds ( ss angles) of ATTp with those of brazzein and a subgroup of knottin proteins, a total of 14 structures (best structure of the ensemble in cases of NMR structures; see Table S4 of the Supporting Information).

ATTp can be characterized (38) as a right-handed hook (first disulfide bond, Cys11-Cys63), a left-handed spiral (second disulfide bond, Cys24-Cys48), and a right-handed hook (third disulfide bond, Cys33-Cys63). The conformation of the fourth

disulfide bond (Cys37-Cys60) does not fit any of the more common topologies. The conformations observed in ATTp, however, are observed in the homologous disulfide bridges of all 14 structures.

Zhao et al. present) is in the trans conformation. The cis conformation of the P3 prolyl peptide bond probably orients the BBI inhibitory loop to the canonical form. The P2 proline of ATTp is not present in BBI, and both the P2 and P3 prolines of ATTp occupy the trans conformation. The unique sequence of the ATTp inhibitory loop (P3-Cys-Ala-Arg-Ile-Phe-ProThr-Ile-Cys-P6) seems to be responsible for the uncommon conformation in this region. The inhibitory mechanism for this class of inhibitors needs to be investigated further. Comparison of the Conformation of the ReactiVe Loop of ATTp to Those of ATI-Type Inhibitors. The Ascaris trypsin inhibitor from the common round worm is the prototypical ATI inhibitor. Structures of ATI-type serine proteinase inhibitors have been determined by NMR (48) and X-ray (49) techniques. Sequence alignments and the common disulfide-paring pattern are shown in Figure 11. For ATI, the conformation of the reactive loop is dependent on pH; at pH e2.4, the reactive loop adopts the conventional conformation observed in BBI and Kazal inhibitors among others, and at pH >4.5, the conformation of the P2, P1, and P1 residues is noncanonical. The P3-P3 backbone dihedral angles for this class are provided in the Supporting Information (Table S5). In the structure of ATTp, which was determined at pH 5.0, the backbone dihedral angles of the P3-P3 residues, particularly the  angle of P1, are reminiscent of the ATI class of inhibitors at high pH. We have also found that the P1  angles in a couple of ATI class inhibitors, at pH g4.5, are also negative (50, 51), similar to that in ATTp. In contrast, at lower pH (2.4 and 2.5) (48, 52) or in a complex (49), the P1  angles become more canonical. Upon superimposition of the reactive loops (P3-P3) of ATTp, ATI inhibitors, and a Bowman-Birk serine proteinase inhibitor determined by NMR (53), it is apparent that the conformation of the P1 side chain of ATTp resembles those of ATI-type inhibitors at high pH (Figure 11A) rather than those of ATI-type inhibitors at low pH or when complexed with a proteinase (Figure 11B). In the ATI structures, the orientation of the P1 side chain is nearly opposite in the low- and high-pH forms. In contrast, the ATI-type inhibitors at low pH (1ATB, 1CCV, and 1EAI) share the same reactive loop conformation with BBI (2BBI) (Figure 11C). This leads us to speculate that the reactive loop of ATTp may undergo similar changes either at low pH or in complex with proteinase.

Conformation of the ReactiVe Site Loop. The reactive sites of canonical serine proteinase inhibitors share a conserved backbone conformation with common  and  angles for residues P3-P3 (11, 46, 47). On comparing the P3-P3 loop conformation of ATTp with those of other types of serine proteinase inhibitors Kazal, Kunitz, Bowman-Birk (BBI), and squash], we found that only the  angle of P1 (Arg27) in ATTp lies outside the common region (see Table S5 of the Supporting Information). When all restraints (sequential and nonsequential) were removed from the loop region (residues 25-30) prior to structure determination, the  and  angle values for Arg27 continued to lie outside the consensus range in all the calculated conformers, but with increased errors. The anomaly might be due to the paucity of constraints for this region resulting from the solvent exposure of the loop or of internal mobility. The htNOE value for the P1 residue is below average. Panels A-C of Figure 9 show superpositions of the P3P3 loop region of ATTp with those of five other serine proteinase inhibitors (three from the squash family and two from the BBI family). With the exception of ATTp, all have nearly identical P3-P3 backbone conformations. The reactive site loop of ATTp and the other five inhibitors exhibit two similarities: the orientation of the peptide bond connecting P1 and P1 and the conformation of the side chain of the P1 residue (Ile28 in ATTp). ATTp differs from the others in three aspects. (i) Pro26, a residue at the P2 position only in ATTp, causes a kink in the backbone of the reactive loop not observed in the other five inhibitors (Figure 9A). (ii) The orientation of the P1 residue of ATTp differs from those of the other inhibitors (Figure 9B). (iii) The side chain of the P2 residue in ATTp has an orientation different from those of the other inhibitors (Figure 9C). Rapeseed and Bowman-Birk are the only two classes of serine proteinase inhibitors that have cysteines flanking the reactive site (P4 and P6 for ATTp and P3 and P6 for BBI) as well as proline at the P3 position. The P3 Pro in BBI is always in the cis conformation, and the P4 Pro (when
