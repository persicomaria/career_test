The crystal structure of glycerol kinase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis (Tk-GK) in a dimeric form was deter° mined at a resolution of 2.4 A. This is the first crystal structure of a hyperthermophilic glycerol kinase. The overall structure of the Tk-GK dimer is very similar to that of the Escherichia coli glycerol kinase (Ec-GK) dimer. However, two dimers of Ec-GK can associate into a tetramer with a twofold axis, whereas those of Tk-GK cannot. This may be the reason why Tk-GK is not inhibited by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, because the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate binding site is produced only when a tetrameric structure is formed. Differential scanning calorimetry analyses indicate that Tk-GK is a highly thermostable protein with a melting temperature (Tm) of 105.4 °C for the major transition. This value is higher than that of Ec-GK by 34.1 °C. Comparison of the crystal structures of Tk-GK and Ec-GK indicate that there is a marked difference in the number of ion pairs in the a16 helix. Four ion pairs, termed IP1­IP4, are formed in this helix in the Tk-GK structure. To examine whether these ion pairs contribute to the stabilization of Tk-GK, four Tk-GK and four Ec-GK derivatives with reciprocal mutations at the IP1­IP4 sites were constructed. The determination of their stabilities indicates that the removal of each ion pair does not affect the stability of Tk-GK significantly, whereas the mutations designed to introduce one of these ion pairs stabilize or destabilize Ec-GK considerably. These results suggest that the ion pairs in the a16 helix contribute to the stabilization of Tk-GK in a cooperative manner.

Glycerol kinase (EC 2.7.1.30; ATP: glycerol 3-phosphotransferase, GK) catalyses the Mg,ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glycerol to produce glycerol 3-phosphate, which is an important metabolic intermediate for glycolysis [1­4]. GK is a member of the ATPase superfamily, which includes hexokinase, actin and heat shock protein [5]. These proteins share a common bbbababa folding motif. The mem-

bers of this superfamily are known to change conformation greatly on substrate binding as a result of interdomain motion. GK is widely present in all three kingdoms of living organisms, including bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. Amongst these GKs, Escherichia coli GK (Ec-GK) has been most extensively studied with respect to its function and structure.

Crystal structure of hyperthermophilic glycerol kinase

Ec-GK exists in a dimer­tetramer equilibrium with an apparent dissociation constant of 61 nm in solution [6]. Kinetic studies have suggested that the dimer is active and the tetramer is inactive [7,8]. The crystal structure of Ec-GK complexed with the substrate analogue indicates that Ec-GK forms an asymmetric dimer with one subunit in an open conformation and the other in a closed conformation [9]. These conformational changes are brought about by interdomain motion. The open conformation, in which the active site is open, is required for efficient catalysis of Ec-GK. Two allosteric inhibitors of Ec-GK, fructose 1,6bisphosphate [Fru(1,6)P2] and the subunit of the glucose-specific complex of enzyme II in the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (IIAGlc), have been well studied for their regulation mechanisms of enzymatic activity [6,9­17]. Fru(1,6)P2 selectively binds to the tetramer and inhibits Ec-GK activity by preventing interdomain motion [16]. In contrast, IIAGlc binds to both dimer and tetramer, and noncompetitively inhibits GK activity for both substrates: glycerol and ATP [10]. The IIAGlc binding site, which is different from the Fru(1,6)P2 binding site, is located far from the active site [13]. GK from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis (Tk-GK) is more stable than Ec-GK [18]. Tk-GK is highly resistant to heat inactivation and fully retains its enzymatic activity on incubation at 90 °C for 60 min; in contrast, Ec-GK loses 90% of its enzymatic activity on incubation at 50 °C for 60 min. Tk-GK shows a high amino acid sequence identity of 57% to Ec-GK. Construction of the chimeric genes of Tk-GK and Ec-GK by DNA shuffling, followed by screening for those encoding chimeric proteins, which are more stable than Ec-GK, indicate that Ec-GK is greatly stabilized by replacing its C-terminal 83 residues with the C-terminal 88 residues of Tk-GK [19]. However, the structural basis for the high stability of the resultant chimeric protein E / T-GK419 and Tk-GK remains to be understood. In addition, unlike Ec-GK, Tk-GK exists only in a dimeric form, is not sensitive to Fru(1,6)P2 inhibition and does not show negative cooperativity for ATP binding [18]. To understand the stabilization mechanism, oligomeric state and unique enzymatic properties of Tk-GK at the atomic level, it is necessary to determine its crystal structure. We have recently succeeded in crystallizing Tk-GK and have performed a preliminary X-ray diffraction study [20]. In this report, we determined the crystal ° structure of Tk-GK at a resolution of 2.4 A. Comparison of this structure with that of Ec-GK reveals that

there is a notable difference in the number of ion pairs in the C-terminal region, especially at the C-terminal helix (a16). To examine whether these ion pairs contribute to the stabilization of Tk-GK, four Tk-GK and four Ec-GK derivatives with reciprocal mutations at these sites were constructed and their stabilities were analysed. We discuss the role of the ion pairs in protein stabilization based on these results.

Results and Discussion
Overall structure The dimeric structure of Tk-GK was refined at a reso° lution of 2.4 A to a crystallographic factor of 17.6% (Fig. 1A). Both subunits, which are termed O and Y, contain 494 of 497 residues. Electron density for the C-terminal three residues is not observed probably because of structural disorder. Subunits O and Y associate into a dimer with a twofold noncrystallographic axis. Each subunit consists of two large domains with a deep and narrow interdomain cleft. Each domain contains a typical bbbababa fold of the ATPase superfamily. The conformation of each subunit is highly similar to that of Ec-GK in an open or closed confor° ° mation, with an rmsd of 1.3 A or 1.4 A, respectively, for all Ca atoms of Tk-GK. However, unlike Ec-GK, which forms a tetramer with a twofold axis in the crystal lattice, Tk-GK forms a hexamer with a threefold axis in the crystal lattice (Fig. 1B). In this structure, three O­Y dimers assemble, such that each subunit is hexagonally arranged. Superposition of the dimeric Tk-GK structure on the tetrameric Ec-GK structure indicates that the interactions between two Tk-GK dimers at the O­X and Y­Z interfaces are too weak to form a tetramer (Fig. 1C). This Ec-GK structure consists of two symmetric dimer structures, in which all four active sites are occupied by one glycerol and one ADP molecule [13]. At the O­X or Y­Z interface of the Ec-GK structure, two a1 helices associate into an antiparallel coiled coil. This coiled coil structure is stabilized by Ala54, Ser58, Val61, Glu62 and Ala65 through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. However, these residues are replaced by Asp52, Arg56, Lys59, Asp60 and Gln63, respectively, in Tk-GK. Four are charged residues. A large decrease in hydrophobicity and large increase in electrostatic interactions at the interface of the coiled coil structure undoubtedly prevent the formation of the coiled coil structure, and thereby prevent the formation of the O­X or Y­Z interface. It has been reported that Tk-GK exists as a dimer in solution, even at relatively high concentrations [18]. It

remains to be determined whether a hexameric form of Tk-GK has any physiological significance. Kinetic and biophysical studies have suggested that the dimer and tetramer are active and inactive forms, respectively, of Ec-GK [7,8]. However these studies cannot exclude the possibility that an active tetramer also exists. Our result that Tk-GK cannot form a

of the interdomain cleft (Fig. 1C). All residues forming this site are fully conserved in Ec-GK (Fig. 2), suggesting that glycerol binds to the active sites of Tk-GK and Ec-GK in a similar manner. Likewise, Asp9 and Asp239 probably form a metal cofactor binding site and Asp239 acts as a catalytic base, as proposed for the corresponding residues of Ec-GK. Some electron density was observed in the glycerol binding site of Tk-GK. The resolution of this electron density was too low to determine the substance. Because the protein was crystallized in the absence of glycerol, several water molecules may bind to this site. In the Ec-GK structure, the ATP binding site is located just above the glycerol binding site in the interdomain cleft [13]. This site is formed by Arg17, Gly266, Thr267, Gly310, Ile313, Gln314, Ala326, Leu381, Ile384, Gly411, Ala412 and Asn415. All of these residues, except Ile313, which is replaced by Val (Val306) in Tk-GK, are conserved in Tk-GK (Fig. 2), suggesting that ATP binds to the active sites of Tk-GK and Ec-GK in a similar manner. Fru(1,6)P2 and IIAGlc binding sites Ec-GK and Tk-GK exhibit approximately 20% [15,16] and 71% [18] of their enzymatic activities in the presence of 1 and 20 mm Fru(1,6)P2, respectively. Two Fru(1,6)P2 binding sites are located at the O­X and Y­Z interfaces of the tetrameric Ec-GK structure [15].

Each site is formed by the two loops (Ile229­Arg236) from different subunits. Two guanidino groups of Arg236 from different subunits are involved in Fru(1,6)P2 binding. On binding of Fru(1,6)P2 to EcGK, its interdomain motion is inhibited, and therefore its enzymatic activity is greatly reduced. The loop (Lys223­Glu229) corresponding to that forming the Fru(1,6)P2 binding site in Ec-GK is located at a similar position in the Tk-GK structure (Fig. 1C). However, the Fru(1,6)P2 binding site is not formed in Tk-GK, because the O­X or Y­Z interface is not formed in Tk-GK. In addition, Arg236 is replaced by Glu229 in Tk-GK and the conformation of this loop in Tk-GK is changed significantly compared with that of Ec-GK. This may be the reason why the enzymatic activity of Tk-GK is not inhibited significantly, even in the presence of 20 mm Fru(1,6)P2 [18]. Likewise, the IIAGlc binding site may not be formed in Tk-GK. According to the crystal structure of Ec-GK complexed with IIAGlc, glycerol and ADP [13], the region containing the N-terminal half of the last a helix and its preceding loop (Pro472­Tyr481) is involved in IIAGlc binding. The structure of this region is well conserved in Tk-GK. However, the amino acid sequence of this region is poorly conserved in Tk-GK (Fig. 2). It has been shown that GK from Enterococcus casseliflavus is regulated in an alternative manner [21,22]. Enterococccal GK is inhibited by Fru(1,6)P2, but not

by IIAGlc. It is activated by a phosphoenolpyruvatedependent, phosphotransferase system-catalysed phosphorylation of a single His residue (His232). This His residue is located near the Fru(1,6)P2 binding site, which is formed at the dimer­dimer interface of the tetrameric structure [22]. However, this His residue and the surrounding aromatic residues are not conserved in Tk-GK. In Tk-GK, this His residue is replaced by Glu (Glu225). Therefore, it seems unlikely that Tk-GK is activated in a similar manner. It has been reported that the regulatory inhibition of GK is essential to prevent the accumulation of toxic glycolytic intermediates and to promote the preferential use of glucose over glycerol [1­4]. The observation that Tk-GK is insensitive to Fru(1,6)P2 and IIAGlc may suggest that hyperthermophilic archaea have developed a unique system to regulate GK activity. Structural features for the thermostabilization of Tk-GK It has been reported that hyperthermophilic proteins are stabilized by various factors, including an increased number of ion pairs [23­28], higher core hydrophobicity [29], increased packing density [30], shorter surface loops [31], oligomerization [32­34], increased number of Pro residues at loop regions [35] and increased number of disulfide bonds [36,37]. A combination of these strategies increases the denaturation temperature of the protein up to 150 °C [38]. However, Tk-GK does not contain any disulfide bond. In addition, no significant difference is detected in the molecular compactness, size of the surface loop, number of Pro residues at loop regions (15 for Tk-GK and 14 for Ec-GK) or the stability of the O­Y interface between Tk-GK and Ec-GK. The solvent-accessible surface area of each monomer buried by the formation of the O­Y inter° ° face is 1653 A2 for Tk-GK and 1631 A for Ec-GK. These values are similar to each other. The most striking feature of this interface is the formation of an antiparallel b sheet between two b20 strands from different molecules (Fig. 1C). Ile356, Ile357, Ile358 and Ile360 located in the b20 strand stabilize this b sheet by hydrophobic interactions. Three of these residues are replaced by Ala, Phe and Leu in Ec-GK. However, all are hydrophobic, suggesting that the stability of the O­Y interface of Ec-GK is not changed significantly relative to that of Tk-GK. To examine whether other factors contribute to the stabilization of Tk-GK, the contents of surface charged and buried apolar residues, and the number of ion pairs of the Tk-GK dimer, were compared with

those of the Ec-GK dimer. The results are summarized in Table 1. The content of surface charged residues of Tk-GK is considerably higher than that of Ec-GK, whereas the content of buried apolar residues of TkGK is comparable with that of Ec-GK. The numbers of ion pairs and ion pair networks of Tk-GK are also considerably greater than those of Ec-GK. Here, these numbers are calculated on the basis of the assumption that ion pairs are formed between two oppositely ° charged groups located within a distance of 4 A and ion pair networks are formed by at least five charged residues. Ion pair networks have been reported to be energetically more favourable than an equivalent number of isolated ion pairs [39,40]. These results suggest that an increased number of ion pairs and ion pair networks, especially the latter, contributes to the stabilization of Tk-GK relative to Ec-GK. Core hydrophobicity may not contribute significantly to this stabilization. Thermal stability of Tk-GK We have shown previously that Tk-GK is much more stable than Ec-GK to irreversible heat inactivation [18]. To compare the thermal stability between TkGK and Ec-GK more quantitatively, heat-induced unfolding of these proteins was analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As the thermal unfolding of these proteins was not reversible under any conditions examined, the thermodynamic parameters for the unfolding of these proteins could not be determined. However, the thermal unfolding curves of both proteins were reproducible, unless the protein concentration, pH and scan rate of DSC were changed significantly. The thermal unfolding curves of both proteins did not show a single transition (Fig. 3), suggesting that the denaturation processes of these proteins consist of multiple steps. The minor transitions for the initial steps may reflect the dissociation of an oligomer into dimers and a dimer into two monomers. The major transition for the last step may reflect unfolding of a monomer. The melting temperature (Tm) of Tk-GK for the major transition

was determined to be 105.4 °C, whereas that of EcGK was determined to be 71.3 °C (Table 2), indicating that Tk-GK is more stable than Ec-GK by 34.1 °C in terms of Tm. Heat-induced unfolding of the chimeric protein E / TGK419, which consists of the N-terminal 418 residues of Ec-GK and the C-terminal 88 residues of Tk-GK (410­497), was also analysed by DSC. The shape of the thermal unfolding curve of this chimeric protein was similar to those of Ec-GK and Tk-GK (data not shown). The Tm value for the major transition of the thermal unfolding curve was determined to be 78.9 °C (Table 2). The difference in Tm values between Ec-GK and E / T-GK419 accounts for 54% of that between Ec-GK and Tk-GK.

The DSC curves of Tk-GK (black), Ec-GK (grey), E467T-Tk-GK (green), K468TTk-GK (blue), E471N-Tk-GK (red) and E479K-Tk-GK (magenta), which were measured at a scan rate of 1 °CÆmin)1, are shown. The proteins were dissolved in 20 mM Gly­NaOH (pH 9.5) at 0.4­0.5 mgÆmL)1.

Construction of the mutant proteins According to the crystal structure of Tk-GK, the C-terminal 88 residues are folded into three helices (a13­a16) and two strands (b20, b21), which are located at the surface of the protein molecule (Fig. 1C). When these structures are compared with those of Ec-GK, a marked difference is observed in the number of ion pairs in the a16 helix (Fig. 4). Four ion pairs, termed IP1­IP4, are formed between Glu466 and Lys468, Glu467 and Arg470, Glu471 and Arg382, and Glu479 and Lys482, respectively, in Tk-GK. These ion pairs are not formed in Ec-GK, because Glu467, Lys468, Glu471 and Glu479 are replaced by Thr476, Thr477, Asn480 and Lys488, respectively, in Ec-GK. In order to examine whether these ion pairs contribute to the stabilization of TkGK, four Tk-GK and four Ec-GK derivatives with reciprocal mutations at the IP1­IP4 sites were constructed. The four Tk-GK derivatives (K468T-, E467T-, E471N- and E479K-Tk-GKs) were designed to remove IP1, IP2, IP3 and IP4, respectively, and the four Ec-GK derivatives (T477K-, T476E-, N480E- and K488E-Ec-GKs) were designed to introduce IP1, IP2, IP3 and IP4, respectively. All mutant proteins, except K488E-Ec-GK, were overproduced in E. coli in a soluble form and purified to give a single band on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The far-UV CD spectra of these mutant proteins were similar to those of the parent proteins, suggesting that the structure of the protein was not changed significantly by the mutation (data not shown). The enzymatic activities of these mutant proteins were also comparable with those of the parent proteins. K488EEc-GK was overproduced in E. coli in both soluble and insoluble forms. However, attempts to purify this protein in a soluble form have so far been unsuccess2637

ful, suggesting that the Lys488 fi Glu mutation greatly destabilizes Ec-GK. Stability of the mutant proteins The stabilities of the Tk-GK derivatives were analysed by DSC. The shapes of their thermal unfolding curves were similar to that of Tk-GK (Fig. 3). The Tm values for the major transition of their thermal unfolding curves are summarized in Table 2. The Tm value of E479K-Tk-GK, which is designed to remove IP4, was lower than that of the wild-type protein by 3.2 °C, whereas those of the other mutant proteins were comparable with that of the wild-type protein. These results suggest that the removal of each ion pair in the a16 helix does not affect the stability of Tk-GK significantly. The Glu479 fi Lys mutation not only removes IP4, but also introduces positive charge repulsion between Lys479 and Lys482. It has been reported that unfavourable interactions by charged residues on the protein surface are more critical than favourable interactions for protein stability [41]. Therefore, E479K-Tk-GK is destabilized probably as a result of the introduction of positive charge repulsion rather than the removal of IP4. It has been reported that ion pairs are not effective for protein stabilization at moderate temperatures, especially when they are fully exposed to the solvent [42], because the desolvation energy for the formation of ion pairs offsets the energetic contribution of charged interactions [43]; however, they are effective at high temperatures because of the reduced desolvation energy for the formation of electrostatic interactions [44]. Our mutational studies on Tk-GK, however, suggest that each ion pair in the a16 helix is not effective for protein stabilization, even at high temperatures. The stabilities of the Ec-GK derivatives were analysed by incubating the proteins at various temperatures for 20 min and determining the residual activities at

Of the four mutant proteins, only T477K-Ec-GK, which is designed to introduce IP1, was more stable than Ec-GK by 5 °C in terms of T1 / 2, whereas those designed to introduce IP2 or IP3 were less stable than Ec-GK by 5 and 8 °C in terms of T1 / 2, respectively. The stability of T477K-Ec-GK was also analysed by DSC. The shape of the thermal unfolding curve of this mutant protein was similar to that of Ec-GK (data not shown). The Tm value for the major transition of the thermal unfolding curve was determined to be 78.9 °C (Table 2). The difference in the Tm values between Ec-GK and T477K-Ec-GK accounts for 40% of the difference between Ec-GK and E / T-GK419. The stabilities of T476E- and N480E-Ec-GKs were

not analysed by DSC, because there is no doubt that these mutant proteins are less stable than the wildtype protein. It should be noted that the effects of the reciprocal mutations at the IP1­IP4 sites on the stabilities of Tk-GK and Ec-GK are not complementary. For example, the mutations designed to remove IP1, IP2 or IP3 from Tk-GK do not affect the stability of Tk-GK significantly. In contrast, the mutation designed to introduce IP1 into Ec-GK stabilizes EcGK considerably, and those designed to introduce IP2 or IP3 into Ec-GK destabilize Ec-GK considerably. Likewise, the mutation designed to remove or introduce IP4 destabilizes both Tk-GK and Ec-GK, but Ec-GK more significantly. These results suggest that the ion pairs in the a16 helix contribute to the stabilization of Tk-GK in a cooperative manner. Stabilization mechanism of T477E-Ec-GK Of the four mutant proteins of Ec-GK, only T477KEc-GK, which is designed to introduce IP1, is more stable than Ec-GK. It remains to be determined whether IP1 is formed in T477K-Ec-GK. However, the stability of T477K-Ec-GK was comparable with that of Ec-GK in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl (data not shown), suggesting that IP1 contributes to the stabilization of T477K-Ec-GK. Electrostatic interactions are normally greatly reduced at high salt concentration. The mechanism by which other mutations destabilize Ec-GK remains to be determined. Unfavourable electrostatic interactions, instead of ion pairs, may be introduced by these mutations. The optimization of electrostatic interactions has been reported to be important for protein stability [45­48]. It has been reported that the N-cap greatly stabilizes the protein [49,50]. N-cap is the residue located one residue ahead of the helix, and forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH group of the first, second or third (most favourably third) residue in this helix through the oxygen atom of its side-chain. Because Glu475 is located at the N-cap position in Ec-GK, this residue probably contributes to the stabilization of T477K-Ec-GK as the N-cap by the formation of IP1 with Lys477 (second residue in the helix).

lized by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method using 0.1 m Tris / HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.2 m MgCl2 and 30% poly(ethylene glycol)400, as described previously [20]. The crystals belonged to space group R3 (H3) (unit cell parame° ° ters: a = b = 217.48 A, c = 66.48 A) and contained two protein molecules per asymmetric unit.

X-ray diffraction data collection and structure determination
X-ray diffraction data were collected at a wavelength of ° 0.9 A with the beam line BL44XU station at SPring-8, Harima, Japan. Diffraction data were processed using the hkl2000 program suite [51]. The structure was initially solved by molecular replacement with the structural model of Tk-GK [18] using molrep [52] in the ccp4 program suite. Model building and refinement of the structure were completed using the programs Coot [53] and refmac [54]. Progress in the structural refinement was evaluated at each stage by the free R factor and by inspection of the stereochemical parameters calculated by the program procheck [55]. The Ramachandran plot produced by procheck showed that almost all the residues in the structure were in the favoured region. The statistics for data collection and refinement are summa-

Experimental procedures
Crystallization
The overproduction and purification of Tk-GK were carried out as described previously [18]. Tk-GK was crystal-

P P Rmerge# = |Ihkl)<Ihkl>| / Ihkl, where Ihkl is the intensity measurement for reflection with indices hkl and <Ihkl> is the mean intensity for multiply recorded reflections. b Rfree was calculated using 5% of the total reflections chosen randomly and omitted from refinement.

rized in Table 3. The figures were prepared by pymol (http://pymol.sourceforge.net).

the codon for Thr476, Thr477, Asn480 or Lys488 of EcGK was changed to GAG for Glu, AAG for Lys, GAA for Glu or GAA for Glu, respectively.

Structure analysis and comparison
The secondary structures of Tk-GK and Ec-GK were defined by the dssp program [56]. The solvent-accessible surface area of the protein was calculated using a probe radius ° of 1.4 A with the program insight II (Biosym / MSI, Tokyo, Japan). Ion pair interactions in both Tk-GK and Ec-GK structures were identified with the program contact in ccp4 [57], using the criterion that the distance between two ° oppositely charged groups is less than or equal to 4 A.

Overproduction and purification
The overproduction of His-tagged E / T-GK419 using the E. coli BL21(DE3) transformants with the pET-28a derivative and purification of the protein were carried out as described previously [19]. Ec-GK was overproduced in the E. coli BL21(DE3) transformants with pET-ecgk as described previously for Ec-GK in a His-tagged form [19], and purified as described below. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min, suspended in 100 mm Tris / HCl (pH 7.5), disrupted in a French pressure cell and centrifuged at 15 000 g for 30 min. The protein in the supernatant was collected by ammonium sulfate precipitation, dissolved in 20 mm Tris / HCl (pH 7.5) and applied to a HiTrapQ HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted from the column by linearly increasing the NaCl concentration from 0 to 1 m. The fractions containing the protein were combined and applied to a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Scale CHT20-I; Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8). The protein was eluted from the column by linearly increasing the buffer concentration from 5 to 500 mm. The fractions containing the pure protein were combined, dialysed against 20 mm Tris / HCl (pH 7.5) and used for further characterization. The protein was concentrated to approximately 2 mgÆmL)1 for storage at )20 °C. The overproduction of the mutant proteins of Tk-GK and Ec-GK, using the E. coli BL21(DE3) transformants with the pET-tkgk and pET-ecgk derivatives, and the purification of these proteins were carried out as described previously for Tk-GK [18] and described above for Ec-GK. The purity of the protein was analysed by SDS-PAGE [58], followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The protein concentration was determined from the UV absorption at 280 nm on the basis that the absorbance of a 0.1% (1 mgÆmL)1) solution at 280 nm is 1.7 for Tk-GK, Ec-GK, E / T-GK419, and Tk-GK and Ec-GK mutants. This value was calculated from the absorption coefficient of 5225 m)1Æ cm)1 for Trp and 1576 m)1Æcm)1 for Tyr at 280 nm [59].

Protein data bank accession number
Coordinate and structural factors for the structure of Tk-GK have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 2ZF5.

Plasmid construction
Plasmid pET-tkgk, which has previously been designated as pET-pkgk, for the overproduction of Tk-GK [18] and the pET-28a derivative for the overproduction of the chimeric protein E / T-GK419 in a His-tagged form [19] have been constructed previously in our laboratory. Plasmid pET-ecgk for the overproduction of Ec-GK was constructed according to the following procedures. The Ec-GK gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of E. coli by PCR using forward (5¢-GGGACAATTACATATGACTGAAAAA-3¢) and reverse (5¢-CGCCGGAATTCTATTATTCGTCGTG-3¢) primers, where the bases in italic represent the NdeI site for the forward primer and EcoRI site for the reverse primer. After digestion with NdeI and EcoRI, the PCR fragment was ligated into the NdeI­EcoRI sites of plasmid pET-25b (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). PCR was carried out with a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) for 35 cycles using KOD polymerase (Toyobo, Kyoto, Japan). The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by a Prism 310 DNA sequencer (GE Healthcare). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Hokkaido System Science (Sapporo, Japan).

Site-directed mutagenesis
Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Tokyo, Japan). Plasmids pET-tkgk and pET-ecgk were used as templates. Four combinations of the 5¢ and 3¢ mutagenic primers were designed for both Tk-GK and Ec-GK, such that the codon for Glu467, Lys468, Glu471 or Glu479 of Tk-GK was changed to ACG for Thr, ACG for Thr, AAC for Asn or AAA for Lys, respectively, and

DSC measurements
DSC measurements were carried out on a high-sensitivity VP-DSC controlled by the vpviewer software package (MicroCal Inc., Tokyo, Japan) at a scan rate of 1 °CÆmin)1. The protein was dissolved in 20 mm Gly­NaOH (pH 9.5) at a concentration of 0.4­0.5 mgÆmL)1. Rescanning of the sample indicated that the thermal denaturation of all proteins examined was irreversible.

Crystal structure of hyperthermophilic glycerol kinase

Enzymatic activity
The enzymatic activity of GK was determined by a two-step procedure, as described previously [19]. In this procedure, glycerol is first phosphorylated to glycerol 3-phosphate by GK at various temperatures, and the amount of glycerol 3-phosphate is determined colorimetrically at 37 °C by coupled enzymatic reaction catalysed by glycerol 3-phosphate oxidase and peroxidase, which were kindly donated by Toyobo.

CD spectra
The far-UV (200­260 nm) CD spectra were measured on a J-725 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic, Tokyo, Japan) at 20 °C. The protein was dissolved in 20 mm Gly­ NaOH (pH 9.5). The protein concentration and optical path length were 0.15 mgÆmL)1 and 2 mm, respectively. The mean residue ellipticity h, which has the unit of degÆcm2Ædmol)1, was calculated using an average amino acid molecular mass of 110.
