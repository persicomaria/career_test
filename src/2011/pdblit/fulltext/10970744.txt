The three forms of alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) within a given strain of Drosophila melanogaster are composed of similar, if not identical, peptide chains as shown by amino acid analysis and peptide fingerprinting. After feeding [carbonyl-`%]nicotinamide to flies, label is associated with only two of the three forms in the ratio 1:2. Similarly, a fluorescent compound is associated with the same two forms. After purification of this compound and characterization of it by thin layer chromatography and mass spectroscopy, we conclude that the multiple forms of Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase appear to be caused by the noncovalent binding of 1 and 2 mol of an NAD-carbonyl compound addition complex to the enzyme.

Adh is the structural gene for alcohol dehydrogenase (Alcohol:NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.1) in Drosophila melan,ogaster. Over the past few years, it, and its ultimate gene product, have become of increasing interest to investigators in a variety of disciplines. For example, several groups have employed naturally occurring and mutageninduced variants ofAdh to study the control of gene function (l-3). Others have examined the physiology of ethanol utilization using variants ofAdh (4, 5). Finally, a large number of laboratories have studied several aspects of population and ecological genetics, making use of the electrophoretic and heat-sensitive variants that are known to exist at the Adh locus (6). Yet, at least one difficulty exists in this system that complicates interpretations in many of these studies: the presence of mul' Contribution No. 992 from the Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University. This investigation was supported by grants from the NIH (GM-18254), from the NIEHS (ES-01527), and a contract from the Dept. of Energy (EY-76-S-02-2965). Drs. Schwartz and O'Donnell were supported by predoctoral fellowships from the NIH (GM-57). 2 Present address: Department of Biological Sciences, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15121. < t

tiple forms of the enzyme. As shown schematically in Fig. 1, each of the electrophoretic variants that map to the Adh locus (Adh", Adhs, and Adh") exhibits three zones of alcohol dehydrogenase activity. The electrophoretic variants have been shown to be caused by genetically controlled differences in the primary structure of alcohol dehydrogenase (7), but the multiple forms within a given variant appear to originate by an epigenetic mechanism. As first observed by Johnston and Denniston (8), and subsequently by Ursprung and Leone (9), each of the multiple forms shows a consistent pattern of enzyme activity and stability after electrophoresis: The most cathodally migrating form appears to be the most enzymatically active but the least heat stable; the least cathodally migrating form the least active and the most heat stable; and the intermediate form intermediate with respect to both these properties [Fig. 1, (lo)] [Electrophoresis of extracts derived from heterozygous flies produce more complicated zymograms (Fig. 1). It is thought that the bands that are not found in the parental strains are due to the formation of heteropolymers.

The detection and characterization of that molecule form the bulk of this report.
METHODS Drosophila cultures. Dwsophilu ttrelaxogastev (IL'; Adh') were grown in mass culture according to the method of Mitchell and Mitchell (16) for use in most enzyme purification procedures. About 4 days after eclosion, the flies were collected with a vacuum cleaner and immediately frozen. They were stored at -20°C for up to 2 months prior to use. Radiolabeled populations were raised in half-pint bottles containing Formula 4-24 Blue Instant Dlosophiln Medium (Carolina Biological) reconstituted with an equal volume of water containing [carbonyl-llC]nicotinamide. Alcohol dehydrogeuuse pz~tijcatio~~. Alcohol dehydrogenase was purified according to the procedures of Sofer and Ursprung (17) and Borack and Sofer (18), as modified by Schwartz ef al. (19). Two types of purified preparations were obtained. One contained ADH-5 alone; the other, a mixture highly enriched for ADH-3 and ADH-1. In the [carbon yl-`?C]nicotinamide labeling experiment, 40,000 K; Adh' eggs were distributed among 42 bottles of instant medium which contained a total of 250 PC1 of [cnrbonyl-`"Clnicotinamide (50 mCi/mmol). Twenty grams of labeled adults were collected 19 days later and the standard enzyme purification procedure was followed with the following modification. After protamine sulfate and ammonium sulfate (40-60%) precipitations of the crude extract, the enzyme was dialyzed overnight against 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6). After removing the precipitate by centrifugation, the supernatant fluid was passed through a 1.5 x 96.cm column of Sephadex G-25 (Fine) in 0.2 M ammonium bicarbonate. The fractions containing alcohol dehydrogenase from the column were pooled and dialyzed against 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The enzyme was chromatographed on hydroxylapatite previously equilibrated with 0.01 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) and eluted with the same buffer. Assays. One unit of alcohol dehydrogenase activity is defined as that amount of enzyme catalyzing the reduction of 1 nmol of NAD+/min. The assay has been described by Schwartz et al. (19). The histochemical test for alcohol dehydrogenase activity has been described by Grell ef al. (10) and modified by O'Donnell et al. (20). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry as modified by Rutter (21) using bovine serum albumin as a standard, or, for purified enzyme preparations, the absorbance at 280 nm (assuming that a 1 mg/ml solution has an absorbance of 1). Amino acid at~alysis. Samples were hydrolyzed (1 ml constant boiling HCl, 10 ~16% phenol) in evacuated tubes at 110°C for 24,48, or 72 hs. Amino acid analyses

m-ally occurring AdhF variant. These are termed ADH-5," ADH-3, and ADH-1 (Fig. 1). Presumably, the multiple forms observed after electrophoresis of other variants of Adh originate by the same mechanism, so that these studies probably apply to them as well. Jacobson and his co-workers have published a number of reports on the nature and origin of the multiple forms from Adh" (11-15). They postulated that all three have the same primary structure, that their heterogeneity is caused by a conformational change that may be induced by NAD+ or acetone. Their evidence for this hypothesis comes from model experiments. They incubated ADH-5 with NAD' or acetone and generated two new electrophoretic species of alcohol dehydrogenase that behaved like ADH-3 and ADH-1. The chief disadvantage of this approach is that it is indirect. Moreover, the newly generated species are not exactly like the naturally occurring ones (15). We decided to be more direct, to examine the multiple forms as they occur naturally. First, we tried to confirm that they all had the same primary structure. Then, when they in fact were shown to be indistinguishable, we looked for the presence of a molecule bound differentially to some of the multiple forms.

Cystine and cysteine were measured as cysteic acid after performic acid oxidation by the method of Hirs (22). Peptitle jfilryerptinti?lg. Trypsin (250 Kg) was added to between 5 and 10 mg of heat-denatured (5 min, 100°C) alcohol dehydrogenase dispersed in 0.05 M ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.3). Preliminary experiments using an automatic titrator showed that digestion was essentially complete after 40-50 min at 37°C. In the experiments reported here we carried out the digestions for 5-6 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by bringing the solution to pH 6.5. The samples were then frozen, thawed, centrifuged (to remove a very small amount of undigested protein) and lyophilized. The digest was then dissolved in 0.01 XI ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.3) just before chromatography. The tryptic peptides were analyzed by the procedure of Bennett (23). Approximately 0.05 pmol of protein was applied to a 44 x 57.cm sheet of Whatman 3MM paper for descending chromatography in )i-butanol/ acetic acid/water (4/l/5, by volume). After chromatography for 13 h, the paper was dried, turned through 90", and electrophoresis was carried out at 2000 V for 70 min at 25'C in pyridineiacetic acid/water (1:10:89. by volume). Peptides and amino acid markers were visualized by dipping the papers in buffered ninhydrin (24). Tryptophan-containing peptides were stained by the Ehrlich reaction (24). G~JI electtophorcsis. Agar gel electrophoresis was done according to Ursprung and Leone (9). After electrophoresis, the gel was placed in alcohol dehydrogenase histochemical stain. When staining was complete, the gel was fixed in a mixture of 75% ethanol and 5% glacial acetic acid for at least 2 h. Polyacrylamide electrophoresis was carried out using the procedure of Davis (25) with the omission of the spacer and sample gels. Samples in glycerol were layered onto 5%~ acrylamide gels (0.5 x 8 cm). Bromophenol blue was added as a tracking dye. Electrophoresis was carried out for 1.5-2 h at 4°C at 3 mA/tube. Gels were stained for protein with Coomassie blue and destained by diffusion or stained for enzyme activity with histochemical stain. For the determination of radioactivity, the gels were frozen and sliced into l-mm slices using a Mickle gel slicer. Individual slices were incubated at 50°C for 2 h in 0.5 ml of NCS reagent/H,0 (911, by volume) and counted on a Nuclear Chicago Model 720 scintillation counter in 10 ml of Omnifluor.

Alcohol dehydrogenase (enriched for forms 3 and 1) in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate (pH 9.4) was denatured by bringing the enzyme solution to a concentration of 75% ethanol, followed by incubation for 15 min at 40°C.

Protein precipitates were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 18,000 y. The supernatant fluid was dried in a rotary evaporator and redissolved in l-2 ml of distilled water or 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate. The preparation was then applied to a 0.9 x 55 cm Sephadex G-15 column and l-ml fractions were collected. The fluorescence of each fraction was measured. (A Turner fluorometer was used. The primary filter was a Corning No. l-76; the secondary filters ivere numbers 47B and 2A.) The fractions containing fluorescent material were pooled, dried in a rotary evaporator, and redissolved in 0.01 M ammonium bicarbonate. The solution was applied to a DE-52 cellulose column and eluted with a linear (0.01-0.3 M) ammonium bicarbonate gradient. The fractions were monitored as before, and those fractions containing fluorescent material were pooled and dried in a rotary evaporator, redissolved in water, and dried several more times to remove traces of ammonium bicarbonate.

ADH-5 could be prepared free of contaminating proteins and completely separated from ADH-3 and ADH-1. As shown in Fig. 2, ADH3 and ADH-1 were purified as a mixture in order to conserve material, and all the preparations always contained ADH-5 (Fig. 2) [Our model for the origin of the multiple forms predicts that ADH-1 and ADH-3 are in equilibrium with each other and with ADH-5 (see Discussion)]. Comparisons were therefore made between ADH-5 and a mixture of forms enriched for ADH-3 and ADH-1. The latter preparation is termed ADH-M (for mixture). Arrko

FIG. 2. Enzyme mixtures enriched for ADH-3 and ADH-1. After hydroxylapatite chromatography, the mixture was electrophoresed on 5% acrylamide gels for 2 h at 3 mA per tube in Tris-glycine buffer (pH 9.3). Gels were stained with Coomassie blue and scanned at 550 nm in a Gilford gel scanner attached to a Beckman DU spectrophotometer equipped with a Gilford Model 2000 recorder. (A) Composition of the mixture used for the amino acid analysis reported in Table I. It contained approximately 36% ADH-5, 45% ADH-3, and 19% ADH-1. Crude extracts of the WEP strain contain about 60% ADH-5, 30% ADH-3, and 10% ADH-1. (B) Composition of the mixture used for the peptide map in Fig. 3 (top). It contained approximately 29% ADH-5, 45% ADH-3, and 26% ADH-1.

Five or ten microliters (approximately 1 pg) of stand ards or unknowns was spotted on a 20 x 20.cm cellulose plate. The chromatograms were allowed to develop 2-3 h. Discontinuous thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-impregnated cellulose was carried out according to the procedure of Greenman et trl. (28). NAD+-addition compounds were detected as fluorescent spots when viewed under an ultraviolet lamp. Quarternary pyridinium compounds were detected by their reaction with methyl ethyl ketone (29).

Amino acid analysis of ADH-5 and ADH-M are shown in Table I. No significant difference in composition was detected. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3, the peptide "fingerprints" of tryptic digests of the two preparations were indistinguishable. These data indicate that ADH-5, -3, and -1 contain very similar, if not identical, polypeptides. From the peptide mapping we were also able to estimate the number of subunits in the enzyme. Previously we had determined that the molecular weight of native alcohol dehydrogenase was 4.8 x lo4 (17,30). From the number of moles of lysine (32-34) and arginine (lo- 12) per mole of protein, we calculate that if alcohol dehydrogenase were composed of one polypeptide chain, we should find 43-47 spots after fingerprinting. If alcohol dehydrogenase were composed of two identical chains, about one-half that number should be found. Twenty-three spots were observed. This number is consistent with the interpretation that all forms of the enzyme are composed of two identical

After chromatography, the paper was dried and amino acid markers (aspartic acid and arginine) were spotted just below the solvent front.

FIG. 4. Final step in the purification of alcohol dehydrogenase from flies fed [cccrbo?lyl-14C]nicotinamide. Chromatography was carried out on a 1.5 x 26.cm column of hydroxylapatite equilibrated with 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Four-milliliter fractions were collected at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. Onemilliliter aliquots of every other fraction were counted in Aquasol (10 ml) on a Nuclear Chicago Model 720 scintillation counter.

points should be noted concerning these data. First, as can be seen by comparing Figs. 5A and B, ADH-1 tends to elute first from hydroxylapatite, ADH-3 next, and ADH-5 last. (Compare Fig. 5A with B. Figure 5A summarizes the results from fraction No. 26, Fig. 5B from fraction No. 32.) This had been repeatedly observed and contrasts with the behavior of these isozymes on QAE-Sephadex or DEAE-cellulose, where ADH-5 elutes first, and then ADH-3 and ADH-1. Second, after electrophoresis radioactivity is associated with ADH-3 and ADH-1, but not with ADH-5 (Figs. 5A and B). This occurred whether the multiple forms were separated by hydroxylapatite or by ion-exchange chromatography. Third, this kind of experiment can be used

to calculate the ratio of counts associated with ADH-3 to those associated with ADH-1 on a per protein basis. In three experiments, we found that there was 1.9-fold more radioactivity in the ADH-1 fraction (per protein) than in the ADH-3. Again, each time no significant radioactivity was associated with ADH-5. Finally, the radioactivity was not covalently bound to alcohol dehydrogenase, since 73% could be released from the enzyme by denaturation with ethanol (acid denaturation and/or heating to 100°C were equally effective).

The radioactive labeling experiments had indicated that some substance, originally derived from [carbo?7;yZ-14C]nicotinamide, was bound to ADH-3 and ADH-1, but not to ADH-5. Since, in addition, our data indicated that this material was noncovalently bound to alcohol dehydrogenase, we attempted to release it from the enzyme in order to study it in more detail. ADH-M and, as a control, ADH-5, were therefore denatured with ethanol, the precipitated proteins centrifuged, and the supernatant fluids examined.

FIG. 7. Incubation of ADH-5 with ADH factor. Fifty micrograms of ADH-5 in 30 ~1 of 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, was diluted with 200 ~1 of H,O (A) or 200 ~1 of ADH factor (in H,O) (equivalent to about 9 pmol of NAD+) and incubated at 17°C for 17 h. Fifteen micrograms of A and 25 pg of B were subjected to acrylamide electrophoresis and subsequent protein staining. Densitometry readings are shown here.

Fluorescence spectra of ADH factor are shown in Fig. 8A. Note the pronounced shift in maxima with pH. Clearly, these spectra are not similar to those of nicotinamide, NMN, NAD, NADH, NADP, or NADPH. The spectra are, however, virtually identical to those of a class of compounds described by Burton et al. (30-32), Dolin and Jacobson (33), and Everse et al. (26, 34): NAD+carbonyl compound addition complexes. Three of these compounds, NAD-acetone, NAD-acetoin, and NAD-acetaldehyde, were synthesized and their spectra compared with ADH factor. Figure 8B shows the fluorescence spectra at two different pH's for NAD-acetone. (The other compounds have similar spectra.)
Thin Layer Chromatography

Most of the fluorescent material was recovered in peak B. We term this fluorescent material "ADH factor." The evidence that it is responsible for the multiple forms of alcohol dehydrogenase can be summarized as follows. (i) This fluorescent material is found after denaturation of ADH-M, not after denaturation of equal or greater amounts of ADH-5. (ii) Supernatant fractions derived from the denaturation of ADH-5 fail to have an effect on native ADH-5. By contrast, crude supernatant fractions derived from denaturation of ADH-M, as well as purified fluorescent material from peak B (but not the other fluorescent peaks), cause the formation of multiple forms when incubated with native ADH-5 as shown in Fig. `7. (iii) Finally, as shown below, our characterization of the fluorescent substance indicates that it is a low-molecular weight, nicotinamide derivative. Thus it would be expected to contain labeled nicotinamide when [carbonyl-`4C]nicotinamide is fed to flies and to display the properties exhibited

ADH factor, NAD+, NADH, NMN, NAD-acetone, and NAD-acetaldehyde were subjected to thin layer chromatography in four solvent systems. The compounds were detected by their fluorescence under ultraviolet light either before or after treatment with methyl ethyl ketone. (Methyl ethyl ketone is used to detect NAD+ and NMN and other N'-nicotinamide compounds.) Only a single fluorescent spot was observed upon chromatography of ADH factor. It moved differently from NMN, NAD+, or NADH, and similarly (but not identically) to NAD-acetone and NAD-acetaldehyde. (Figure 9 shows the results from one solvent system.) Upon treatment with phosphodiesterase, the fluorescent spot associated with the factor now moved to a different position. In this respect it again behaved similarly to phosphodiesterase-treated NAD-acetone and NAD-acetaldehyde, but not NAD+, NADH, or NMN (Fig. 9).

tained. The spectra of nicotinamide (M, 122) and NAD+ (&f,663.5) are essentially identical. The spectrum of NAD+ is shown in Fig. 10A. The highest mass ion for both NAD+ and nicotinamide is 122, the parent ion of nicotinamide. Since NAD+ and its derivatives are nonvolatile, pyrolysis of the compound apparently caused a fragmentation at the nicotinamide-ribose bond [also observed by Dolin and Jacobson (33)]. Thus, we are observing the fragmentation pattern of only the nicotinamide portion of the molecule. Apparently the remainder of the molecule is not volatilized at this temperature. The highest mass peak for NAD-acetone is 160 and for NAD-acetoin, 190 (Figs. 10B and 1OC). These molecules seemed to fragment in a manner similar to NAD+ since these values are much lower than the molecular weight of either compound. They are also less than expected for the sum of the molecular weights of nicotinamide plus acetone or nicotinamide plus acetoin by 18 mass units. This observation is consistent with the proposed loss of a water molecule on formation of the addition compounds (32). The highest mass peak and the apparent parent ion in the spectrum of ADH factor is mass 220 (Fig. 10D). The molecular mass of the compound, based on the parent ion intensities and using the calibration standard, perfluorotri-N-butylamine, was computed to be 220.16 2 0.1 daltons. A mass measurement of the peak at mle 205 was also made, and the computed mass of this fragment was 205.05 ? 0.1 daltons. Possible molecular formulas for the ions at

based on the mass measurements of the ions. Only one formula for the parent ion had a corresponding formula at mass 205 daltons, which is probably due to the loss of a methyl group. This formula CllH12N203, and its corresponding M-15 formula is C,,H,N,O,. If it is assumed that the factor is an NAD+addition compound, then the mass spectrum should represent nicotinamide plus an unknown carbonyl compound. The molecular

spectrum of the methanol-released compound was identical to that of the ethanol product.
Quantitation of ADH Factor

Ethanol denaturation of the enzyme was chosen as the method for release of the factor because it was thought to be less likely to cause degradation or alteration of the bound molecule than other, harsher methods. However, the possibility remains that ethanol itself was in some way acting upon the ligand, particularly since ethanol is a substrate for Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase. Therefore, attempts were made to release the factor by other means. When ADH-M was denatured with methanol, which is not a substrate for this enzyme, a highly fluorescent material was obtained. It eluted from Sephadex G-15 in precisely the same position as the ethanolreleased compound, and the fluorescence

In order to measure the absolute amount of ADH factor bound to each of the multiple forms of alcohol dehydrogenase (rather than the relative amounts), we electrophoresed an aliquot of ADH-M extracted from flies fed on radioactive nicotinamide on acrylamide gel. After staining and densitometry of the gel, the amount of protein in ADH-3 and ADH-1 was calculated utilizing ADH-5 as a standard. Another aliquot was denatured with ethanol and centrifuged in order to pellet the protein. The supernatant fluid was then evaporated to dryness, dissolved in water, and the pH adjusted to 2.5 with acetic acid. A portion of this solution was taken for radioactive analysis. It was found that 73% of the counts originally associated with the enzyme was recovered. When the fluorescence of this material

was measured and then compared with known amounts of NAD-acetone, we were able to calculate that we had released 3.7 nmol of an NAD-addition compound. The ADH preparation contained 1.4 nmol of ADH-1 and 2.4 nmol of ADH-3. If there were 1 mol of addition complex bound per mole of ADH-3 and 2 mol of complex bound per mole of ADH-1, then 5.2 nmol of fluorescent compound should have been released. Thus the 3.7 nmol represent 71% of the expected value. This compared well with the recovery of radioactivity associated with labeled nicotinamide. We therefore conclude that ADH-1 has approximately 2 mol of this compound bound per mol of protein while ADH-3 has approximately 1 mol bound.

FIG. 12. The mechanism of formation of the multiple forms of alcohol dehydrogenase. The model 0 hypothesizes that NAD+ and some carbonyl compound or compounds (R-C-R') form complex I in the presence of alcohol dehydrogenase. Complex I binds tightly to the enzyme (perhaps at the active site) and forms the multiple forms. Upon denaturation, I cyclizes into II, the reduced carbonyl addition complex, which in turn may be oxidized in the presence of oxygen to III or IV. Compounds II, III, and IV are fluorescent (34).

moved by centrifugation, and the supernatant fluid incubated with native ADH-5, we observe the formation of new electrophoretie forms of the enzyme that behave similarly to ADH-3 and ADH-1. A supernatant fluid derived from ADH-5 has no such effect. These data suggest a simple model (shown in Fig. 12) for the multiple forms of alcohol dehydrogenase. We hypothesize that in the presence of NAD+ and certain carbonyl compounds (carbonyl compounds that have structures similar to substrates of alcohol dehydrogenase), alcohol dehydrogenase will catalyze the formation of the covalent addition complex, I. Compound I is believed to bind to the enzyme tightly. Since compound I is negatively charged, its binding results in the formation of two additional forms: molecules of alcohol dehydrogenase with 1 or 2 mol of I attached. These forms are in equilibrium with ADH-5. We postulate that the binding lowers the enzymatic activity of the enzyme and tends to stabilize it against denaturation. Upon denaturation, I is released from the enzyme. In ethanolic solution [as noted by Everse et al. (34)], it tends to cyclize and form compound II, the reduced addition complex. In turn, in the presence of oxygen, II spontaneously oxidizes to III or IV (depending upon the pH). It is these last two compounds that we detected after denaturation of alcohol dehydrogenase. This sequence of events is virtually identical to that proposed by Everse et aZ. (26,34)

who have studied the interaction of a variety of dehydrogenases with NAD and carbonyl compounds. Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase apparently differs from some of the other enzymes studied in that the binary complex (enzyme, NAD- carbonyl compound) is sufficiently stable so that it persists through various separative techniques and manifests itself in the formation of multiple forms. The model makes several testable predictions. One is that upon an increase in the concentration of the hypothesized carbonyl compound(s), ADH-3 and ADH-1 should form at the expense of ADH-5. We could not make a direct test of the hypothesis because the carbonyl compound tentatively identified by mass spectroscopy is not commercially available. Instead, we fed flies a number of commercially available alcohols and carbonyl compounds. Some of these compounds cause a shift in the isozyme pattern, with ADH-3 and ADH-1 forming at the expense of ADH-5 (35). These results tend to confirm our model. Those compounds that are most effective in shifting the isozyme pattern are secondary alcohols and ketones, a fact that correlates well with the marked substrate preference of Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase for secondary alcohols (17). Again, the fact that the model allowed us to make and verify this prediction seems to us to be a powerful confirmation of its validity. Nevertheless, some of the data upon which the model is based should be critically

evaluated. For example, the presence of radioactivity associated with ADH-3 and ADH-1, but not with ADH-5, was one of the first observations that led us to propose the model. However, we have no direct evidence that the counts associated with alcohol dehydrogenase detected after feeding radioactive nicotinamide are in the same compound(s) purified and characterized in our biochemical studies. In fact, we have no direct evidence that the label remains in nicotinamide. Efforts to liberate labeled material from alcohol dehydrogenase and then to purify and characterize it by thin layer chromatography have failed for lack of sufficient counts in the material. A second problem comes from the observation that NAD+ by itself can cause a change in the distribution of the multiple forms when incubated with alcohol dehydrogenase ill vitro (15). This objection is not as serious as the first, because Jacobson has shown that NAD-acetone is formed in frozen alkaline solutions and that commercial preparations of NAD+ contain acetone (33). Thus we argue that NAD+ itself might not be causing the interconversion of ADH-5 to ADH-3 and ADH-1. Instead, impurities in the NAD+ preparation might form addition complexes. In accord with this is the observation that high concentrations of NAD+ are necessary to cause this effect. Also, we, and Jacobsonet al. (15), have both observed that relatively low concentrations of NAD+-acetone can cause conversion. Despite these questions, the model seems to be the simplest and strongest explanation of the data. If it is correct, one can ask what the role of the NAD+-carbonyl compound-ADH complex is in the fly. We do not know. Any postulated role must take into account the fact that the addition complexes seem to be inhibitory to the enzyme but also seem to stabilize it against heat denaturation. The answer to the question of exactly what role the multiple forms play may have to come from the isolation of mutants that lack these forms.
