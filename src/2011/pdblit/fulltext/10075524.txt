The crystal structure of malate dehydrogenase from Escherichia coli has been determined with a resulting R-factor of @187 for X-ray data from 8.0 to 1.87 8. Molecular replacement, using the partially refined structure of porcine mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase as a probe, provided initial phases. The structure of this prokaryotic enzyme is closely homologous with the mitochondrial enzyme but, somewhat less similar to cytosolic malate dehydrogenase from eukaryotes. However. all three enzymes are dimeric and form the subunit'-subunit interface through similar surface regions. A citrate ion, found in the active sit,e, helps define the residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis. Two arginine residues, R81 and R153, interacting with the citrate are believed to confer substrate specificity. The hydroxyl of the citrate is hydrogen-bonded to a histidine, H177, and similar int8eractions could be assigned to a bound malate or oxaloacetate. Histidine 177 is also hydrogen-bonded to an aspartate, D150, to form a classic His. Asp pair. Studies of the act,ivr site cavity indicate that the bound citrate would occupy part of the site needed for t'he rornzymr. In a model building study, the cofactor. NTAD, was placed into the coenzyme site which exists when the citrat'e was converted to malate and crystallographic water for molecules removed. This hypotheGca1 model of a ternary complex was energy minimized comparison with the structure of the binary complex of porcine cytosolic malatr E. coli malate dehydrogenase. Many residues involved in cofactor binding in the minimized dehydrogenase structure are homologous to coenzymr binding residues in cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. In the energy minimized structure of the ternary complex, the C-4 atom of NAD is in van der Waals' contact wit,h the (J-3 atom of the malatr. A catalytic cycle involves hydride transfer between these two at,oms.

(M(~Alister-Henn rt al., 1987: Sutherland & McAlister-Henn. 1985). Tn eukaryotic cells, at least two forms of t,hr enzyme can be found. One form is a principal enzvme of the citric acid cycle operating within the mttochondria. The other is found in the cytosol where it participates in the malatelaspartate shuttle. This shuttle exchanges reducing equivalents across the mitochondrial membranes in t'he form of malate/oxaloacetate rather t)han as NAD/NADH. A third isozyme can be found in the glyoxysomes of yeast, where it' functions to convert malate that is produoed from glyoxylate in the glyoxylate cycle (Minard B McAlister-Henn, 1991). The crystal structures of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenases. both from porcine heart, have been determined (R&rick &

transfer of the hydride ion to either face of the nicotinamide ring depends on the syn versus anti orientation of the glycosidic bond leading to type A and type B dehydrogenases. The closest structural homology exists between subclasses. Both MDHases and lactate dehydrogenase (LDHase) are in the same subclass and are structurally homologous in both the NAD binding domain and the catalytic domain. The structural similarit,y between the MDHases and LDHases is presumably related t'o the similarity in the substrates; both catalyze the interconversion of a-hydroxyacids to u-ketoacids. Although the amino acid sequences of LDHase are only about 20% homologous with those of eMDHase and mMDHase, it is believed LDHases utilize t,he same catalyt,ic mechanism to reversibly oxidize lactate to pyruvate. Comparisons between LDHase and MDHase indicate that they have similar catalytic residues.

The carbon atoms are numbered as they will be referred to in the ensuing text. Here, we describe the refined structure of eMDHase at 1.87 ,% resolution. The crystalline enzyme contains a citrate ion bound in the active sit,e. Citrate is very similar in structure to malate as is shown above, and mimics malate in the active site without itself bring oxidized. More import)ant than the structural similarity, the interactions of citrate with residues in the active site clearly indicate that citrate is a substrate analog and point to all of the residues involved in the binding of substrate and some that are involved in catalytic function. The active site region of the MDHase-citrate complex resembles the structure of the active sit'e region of the t'ernary complex of porcine LDHase with S-lactate, covalent,ly linked to NAD, serving as a substrate analog (Grau et al., 1981). However, the eMDHase structure shows with greater clarity the residues specific to malate binding and to catalysis. Th e greatest degree of structural similarity among t,he dehydrogenases can be found in the NAD binding domain. In general, the dinucleotidr coenzyme binds to this domain in an open or extended conformat'ion. MDHases and LDHasen both belong to i.he type A group of dehydrogenases in which the sterrospecific transfer of the hydride takes place on {`he A side of the nicotinamide ring. due to the anti orientat.ion of the glycosidic bond. The structural similarity between eMDHase and cMDHase. along w&h analysis of the cofactor binding cavity adjacent to the active site in eMDHasr. led us t'o attrmpt the docking of the

Molecular replacement techniques from the XPLOR program package were used to obtain initial phases (Brunger, 1990: Brunger & Krukowski. 1990). The first step was to perform a rot,ation function to orient the homologous structure or probe in the eMDHase unit cell. The partially refined structure of porcine heart mMDHase with an R-factor of 025 at 2.5 w resolution was used as the probe model. The range of the data used to calculate the Patt,erson maps for bot)h eMDHase and mMDHase was from 7.0 to 3.0 x resolution. Out of' the 198 unique rotation function peaks detected. a single peak at 3140 above background was found. with the next highest peak at 1.92a. A model consisting of conserved residues from the probe. mMDHasr. but wit'h alaninr residues subs& tuted for all non-identical residues was also used in the rotation function and confirmed the init>ial solution. The unambiguous rotation function solution was then used for a rigid body refinement without the need for Patterson correlation refinement) as implement,ed in SPLOR. The next step was a translation search t.o find the Il,cation of t,he newly oriented probe structure in the unit cell. The original complete m1lDHasr model and data from 7.0 to 3.0 A$ were also used for the translation t'unc*tion. The translation search yielded an unequivocal solution at 8.3~ over background to give an init)ial X-fac%or of 0.483 from 8.0 to 2..5A resolution.

Franc?). As the electron density became more int,erpretabie. thr correct side-chain atoms for eMDHase were added to the model. When no major errors remained in the structure, at an R-fact,or of 0.272, least-squares refinement with X PT,OR without molecular dynamics was used. ITnac:caounted-for electron density in the act,ive site region. similar in form to a citrate, was fitted wit,h a model of t,he Atrate ion. The presence of numerous hydrogen-bonding interact,ions between the citrate molecule and catalytic residues of t,he rMDHase further confirmed the existencne of this substrate analog in the structure. Wat,er molecules were eventually inserted into the structure in regions of electron densit,y having values ofa,t least P.T,a on fob- FC maps and 1.5a on PF,- Fc maps, providrd the water molecules were not less than a hvdrogrtl-bonding distance of 2.8 ip to neighboring atoms. -4fter all the csorrecatside-chains for rMl>Hase were in place and most of the water molecules were inserted, restrained temperature factor refinement was also carried out. The final st.ages of refinement involved interactive (*y&s of least-squares refinement. temperature factor refinement. watrbr insertion and model adjustment. Refinement was caonsidered finished when no correct,ablr errors were visi hle in the model. no further improvement in grometry should br made. and the R-factor would not clec*rrasr despitcl cahanges made to the (*o-ordinates.

Ntructure

The secondary structure present in eMDHase, on the basis of the met,hods of Kabsch & Sander (1983}.

is visible in cartoon form in Figure 4(a) or in st'ereo in Figure 4(b). A t,otal of 11 P-strands forming three p-sheets are present. The first' six B-strands `in the protein are parallel to each other and connected by a-helical segments to form a single p-sheet. This is the dinucleotide binding domain of eMDHase and is homologous with the same region in c_MDHase and mMDHase. Tn Figure 4(a), the six strands st.art at the bottom right and continue diagonally upward to the left. A second P-sheet (II) is made up of t'wo antiparallel P-strands. BG (172 t,o 176) and PH (181 to 1871, shown in Figure 4(b), with a degree of righthanded twist that is somewhat greater than that seen in sheet, I.

In each row, the averaged temperature factor for the backbone atoms are plotted on the bottom half and the averaged for the side-chain atoms are plotted on the upper half.

another sheet (III), The first' half of sheet III consists of two antiparallel strands that twist approximately 90" to form the second half. In the second half, however, a third strand, PM, also antiparallel in direction, interacts with the two other strands. Therefore, P-sheet III includes /?K (249 to 259), /?I, (264 to 271) and PM (276 to 280). For the most part, p-strands are in the interior of the molecule and are not exposed to solvent,; only the turns connecting the B-strands protrude significantly into solvent, except for the /?G-/?H turn mentioned above. However, the p-strands /?C and /?M lie on the outer surface of t,he molecule and are in direct contact with the solvent. The location of /IM correlates with the elevated temperature factors seen for this area. Three long a-helices have distinct bends in them. In each case, at the site of the bend, a helical hydrogen bond is disrupted and is mediated instead by a water molecule (Blundell et al.. 1983). The helical bends, including residues 87 to 109, 195 to 216 and 284 to 312, are visible in Figure 4(b). The aDE helix, which constitutes a part of the connection between strands BD and BE in b-sheet I, bends about 45" at N93. The missing helical H-bond is

replaced by an intermediate water molecule (W319. B = 23.9 A') linking the carbonyl group of N92 with the peptide nitrogen atom of G96. Water molecules with B values in the same range as those of protein atoms (18.8 A*) suggest well occupied sites. Water molecules with H values greater than 35 are probably poorly occupied sit,es. The alG/crBG helix bends at N207 about 50". Although it appears as one long bent helix, it has been divided into two segments, ctlG and cr2G, in accordance with the nomenclature that has been used previously for dehydrogenases (Rossmann et al., 1975). It is unusual in that it is bent in a concave manner with respect to the rest of the subunit. In the ctlG/a2G bend, the carbonyl groups from three residues do not have normal helical hydrogen bonds but. instead, interact with water molecules. The carbonyl group of R205 forms a hydrogen bond with W381 (B = 23.7 A*), the carbonyl group of 1206 with W317 (B = 7.7 A*) and finally the carbonyl group of Q207 with W318 (B = 12.4 A*); which is, in turn, hydrogen bonded to the peptide nitrogen of G210. The final and longest secondary structure element in the molecule is the ctH helix at the C terminus,

Segments of undesignated secondary structure, usually random coils, are indicated by the rope-like segment's. Classification of secondary structure is based primarily on the configuration of the main-chain as described by G$/IJ angles and on the hydrogen bonding pattern observed. The beginning and end of an a-helix or /?-strand are the first and last residues making the appropriate hydrogen bonds between peptide carboxp and amide groups. Regions not conforming to any known secondary structure element are called random coil. (b) The stereo drawing is an a-carbon representation of the eMDHase structure.

atom of G294 is only 3.4 A from W363 mentioned above. Finally, the carbonyl group of M295 forms a 3,,, type hydrogen bond with T298, while 1,296 forms a normal helical H-bond with L300. The helix then continues for 12 additional residues. Each of the three bent, helices mentioned above are on the

1981; Birktoft & Banaszak, 1983). The histidineaspartate proton relay system first found in cMDHase and later in LDHase is present in eMDHase (Birktoft et al., 1989a,b). It is also shown in Figure 6. Note that both side-chain oxygen atoms of DI50, ODI and ODZ are hydrogen-bonded to SD1 of H177. This arrangement apparently alters the pK of the imidazole ring. Histidine 177 is also hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl oxygen atom of citrate oia NE1 As in the homologous dehydrogenases, it is in position to accept or donat'e the substrate hydroxyl proton during catalysis. Also hydrogen-bonded to the substrate hydroxyl oxygen at.om is NE of R87. The nearby positively charged R87 could serve to stabilize the oxygen atom in the anionic state after proton transfer to the His-Asp pair (Clarke et aE., 1986). R87 is located on a loop called the /j'DcrD loop. In the apostructures of LDHases and cMDHase, this same loop region extends into the solvent. Upon binding of substrate, the /?DaD loop in this family of enzymes changes conformation by folding over the active site. The structure of the ternary complex of LDHase with S-lac-NADf indicates the equivalent loop folded over the active site and an arginine residue in close proximity to the substrate. but not hydrogen-bonded to it (Grau et al., 1981). Comparisons of models of the structure of eMDHase reveal that when R87 is deleted from the loop, t,he active site is a continuous cavity that. reaches to the surface of the molecule as found in structures with the loop in the extended position. sit)e, When the loop is folded over the active however. R87 blocks the exit of substrate and shields the site from solvent. The loop, presumably. assumes the same extended conformation as the region in cMDHase or the LDHases. homologous when substrate or citrate is not present,. but little direct evidence for that conformation can be inferred from the crystallographic eMDHase-citrat'e complex reported here. Based on temperature factors, the same loop region in cMDHase, when not engaged in binding substrate, is less ordered (Birktoft it al.. 1989a,b). A structure of lactate dehydrogenase from dogfish (Scybiorrhinus canicolus) with a citrate ion in the active site has also been solved; however, the position of the citrate offers little information in terms of subst,rat~e binding or c:atalysis (Abad-Zapatero ef al., 1987). One hydrogen bond is formed to an oxygen atom on each carboxyl group, which indicates a mode of citrate specific binding but indicates no reasonable pattern from which binding of lactate or malate could be inferred. A hydrogen bond is made between the catalytic histidine and a carboxyl oxygen atom, hut not to the hydroxyl group. An attempt) was made to locate a citrate molecule bound to the putative allosteric site, but none could be found, nor could an allosteric site be identified (Mullinax et al., 1982). It is possible that the binding of citrate in the active site may alter the conformation of the enzyme to preclude binding at an allosterir site.

Work is in progress on preparing suitable crystals of the binary complex of eMDHase and SAI).

Tt is no surprise> that t.hr panforma&n of the domain in t,he eMDHase struc'turr is extn>mely similar t,o that of the SXI) binding domain in cMDHase and dogfish I,I)Hasr. In all cases there are significant numbers of non-polar residues lining the cavity. However. the cY1DHase structure contains bound NAD molrc&~s. one per monomeric subunit, thus indicating that the conformation of t.he domain changes little af'ttxr the cofactor binds. To facilitate visualization of the caavity in the NA r> binding domain, the cavities were modelled as filled spaces. The cavities calculated from the crystal co-ordinates (Levitt, & Banaszak, 1991) without bound water molecules art' shown in the present-e of citrate and malate. see Figure i(b) and (c). respectively. Figure 7(a) shows the c*avity in the overall rrystallographic struct.ure. The cavity search procedure finds a large number of indentations and small ctavitirs, but the ones illustrated in Figure 7(a) and (b) are adjacent to the sub&rate binding site and agree with the location of the cor~~vme binding site based on the &DHase homolog\-. sate that, the available coenzyme cavity in the presence of (titrate is considerably smaller than in the presence of malate (Fig. 7(b) ~t~rsus (c)). `Thtl volume of the cornzyme cavity is decreased from 509 to 451 .A3 for malate brcaause the when citrate is substituted additional arm, C-5 and carboxylatr (`-6 of citrate. protrudes into the NAD cavity.

water molecules. also in the cavity, were removed from the co-ordinate list. The eMDHase-malateNAD ternary complex was then submitted to energy minimization with no atoms restrained. The structure was minimized well before 200 cycles at substantially lower energy than the starting structure. The r.m.s. deviation from the cryst'allographic co-ordinates of eMDHase is 0.45 ,L. Without the const'raint of X-ray data, the geometry, of course. improved significantly: r.m.s. deviation is 0.008 AA for bonds and 2.56" for angles. The overall conformation of the NAD in the energy minimized eMDHase-NAD complex differs little from that seen in the crystallographic cMDHase structure. It is shown in Figure 8. Note t,hat the nicotinamide and adenosine rings remained planar and both glycosidic bonds are anti. Both riboses have 2'.endo puckering. As can be seen in Figure 8, the largest difference occurs at the 3' oxygen atom on the nicotinamide ribose. In the crystal structure of cMDHase. it is in an axial while in the energy minimized orientation. eMDHase complex, it appears more equatorial. The only identifiable reason for this change in the eMDHase structure is a hydrogen bond that, appears to occur between the carbonyl oxygen atom of WC1 and the 3'WH of the nicotinamide ribose. After the energy minimization, t'he adenosine and pyrophosphate moieties remain similar in conformation to the corresponding atoms of NAD in t,he cMDHase cryst'al st'ructure as well as in the minimized cMDHase structure. In eMDHase, however,

there is a definite shift of the plane of the nicotinamide ring so that the C-4 position of the ring is approximately O.`i,? w closer to the malate than it was in the st'arting structure. A possible cause for this diffference could be due to the presence of a sulfatta ion in the cMDHase struct'ure rather than a substrate analog. Another contributing fact'or could be the difference in loop positions. closed in eMDHase but open in cMDHase. There was no change in the position of the loop in either eMDHase or cMDHase during minimization. By comparing Figures 6 and 8. one can see t)hat the position of the substrate and the active site residues changes little when the cofactor is added. All the hydrogen bonding int'eractions found in t)he binary complex are preserved in the hypothetical t,ernary complex. One difference detected. however, is that the imidazole ring of H177 moves approximately 0.5 L& toward the P1'4D, presumably t'o allow hydrogen bonding with 0-1X of the carboxyamide group. Malate rotates slightly t'o accommodate the cofact)or and the interact'ion with the histidine. In speculation about the catalytic mechanism, it is of interest that the C-4 of the nicotinamide ring moves to within 3.4 A of the C-3 of malat'e. It is between these two atoms that hydride transfer must occur during a catalytic cycle and the proposed trajectory is marked by a heavy broken line in Figure 8. Although the ordered mechanism states t'hat the cofactor binds before substrate, there appear to be no steric constraints t#o prevent the binding of substrate first.

For t'he sake of comparison and to reaffirm t,he energy minimization approach described above. the original cMDHase-SAD binary complex was also refined with XPLOR. combining X-ra)- data and t'he XPLOR' energy terms. Next, it was energ) minimized without X-ray dat'a, as in the case of eMDHase-NAD-malate. described above. The X-ray R-factor from the XPLOR positional retinement stage is 0.178 compared to 0167 using TST as et al., 1989a,b). The described previously (Birktoft r.m.s. deviation of the XPLOR refined structure from the original (Birktoft rt ab., 1989n.b) is 0.36 .% for both subunits. The energy minimization without .X-ray dat'a gives a structure that has an r.rn.s. deviation from the XPLOR refined structure of 0.48 A. The SAD molecules of the original cbMI)Hase--NAD binary complex, the XPLOR refined and the energy mmlmized structures are all highly superimposable, essent,ially ident'ical. The XPLOR refined and then energy minimized structure differs from the original in only one respect. the 3' oxygen on the nicotinamide ribose is shifted from an axial to a more equatorial posit'ion as was found in the minimized eMDHase-NAD structure. One can conclude t,hat further refinement of the original least-syuares refined cMDHase-NAD structure with XPLOR essentially made it more similar to t,he minimized e)IDHase-NAD st'ructure. The energ). rninimization of t,he c,MDHase holo-structure appears to be a reasonable cont,rol for the predicted eMDHas+ NACmalate comples.

Table 3 lists the major hydrogen bonding interactions present between the protein and the eoenzyme in the energy minimized structures of In both cases, backbone eMDHase and GDHase. amide groups and carbonyl oxygen atoms plaq major roles in forming polar bonds to the ribose and phosphate oxygen atoms. Homologous residues are involved in similar interactions with NAD. For instance. 1)34 in eMDHase and 1141 in cMDHase both bind to 0-BR and 0-3R, and Nl 19 in eMDHaae and S130 in c&lDHase bind to Cl-SQ. The caat'alytic histidine anchors the nicotinamide by binding to t'he carboxyamide oxygen atom of the nicotinamide moiety. Water interactions are also abundant. As in the original crystal structure of the et nl.. 1989n,b). where the c,\ilDHase dimer (Birktoft interactions between the enzyme and the (sofactor are not ident,ical in the two subunits. different intera&ions caan be seen in the energy minimized c:MDHase-N.41) subunits as well. As can be seen in Table 3, the interactions found in the eMDHa,se9AD complex are shared with either subunit A or 13. or both in the &DHase-NAD crystal structure. The slight variation in binding modes of NA4D to different enzymes. or to separate subunits of the same enzyme (c?olDHase). leaves open the question of a single "caorrec+" mode of binding.

The fortuitous binding of citrate in the active site and the high resolut,ion of the st'ructure provided a unique opportunity to view catalytic residues int,eracting with a substrate analog and to observe the interactions between subunits. The four additional atoms contained in citrate as opposed to the substrate malate, do not interact directly with the protein. Studies of the nearby coenzyme cavity indicate that they protrude into t,he Z?AD binding site. When these atoms are removed. it is possible to dock XAD into a site that corresponds to the coenzyme binding site in After docking, t'he NAD-rMDHase cMDHase. complex can he energy minimized without any dramatic alterat'ions in the enzyme or the coenzyme conformation. This hypothetical model then contains the co-ordinates of the enzyme, coenzyme and the substrate. I>-malate. A control experiment with cMDHase produced little change in the crystallographic: co-ordinat,es. Nonetheless, it is necessary to recognize that the eMDHase-NXD-malate sterpochemical arrangement is only a hypothetical model of the eM DHase active site. In t)he active site. the (`-2 hydroxJ;l of malate. by virtue of its hydrogen bond interactlon with H177, is in the correct posit)ion for proton removal by the ternay His. Asp pair. In the energy minimized complex. the Hl77. I>150 pair is intact while a hydrogen bond is formed bet*ween H177 and the oxygen atom of the rarboxyamide group of the NAD. This suggests that H177 is not only responsible for the proton removal from t,he hydroxvl group of malate, but may also help hold the nicot%inamide ring in posit,ion. During the catalytic reaction, t,he (`-4 position of the nicotinamide ring is thought to
awept a hydride ion from the substrate C-2. In the cwergy minimizc,d structure, these two carbon atoms XSF (DMB 8941746) the Supewomputer Institute. and the
