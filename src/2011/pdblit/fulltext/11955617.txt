Transcription factor 1 (TF1), a type II DNA-binding protein encoded by the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPO1, has the capacity for sequence-selective DNA binding and a preference for 5-hydroxymethyl2 -deoxyuridine (HmU)-containing DNA. In NMR studies of the TF1/HmU-DNA complex, intermolecular NOEs indicate that the flexible b-ribbon and Cterminal a-helix are involved in the DNA-binding site of TF1, placing it in the b-sheet category of DNAbinding proteins proposed to bind by wrapping two b-ribbon ``arms'' around the DNA. Intermolecular and intramolecular NOEs were used to generate an energy-minimized model of the protein ­ DNA complex in which both DNA bending and protein structure changes are evident. 1997 Academic Press Key Words: transcription Factor 1; nuclear magnetic resonance; protein­DNA complex.

The study of interactions of proteins with their target sites has resulted in exciting advances in our understanding of biological mechanisms of gene regulation. Many DNA-binding motifs have been identified such as helix-turn-helix, homeodomain, zinc finger, steroid receptor, leucine zipper, helix-loop-helix and b-sheet motifs (1). Type II DNA-binding proteins (DBP II)2 are a family of abundant, basic, and dimeric prokaryotic proteins characterized by a binding motif consisting of a b-sheet and a b-ribbon ``arm'' that is proposed to wrap around the DNA (2). This general understanding of the interactions of DBP II proteins with DNA has been

gained from indirect techniques, such as DNA footprinting and site-directed mutagenesis. In recent years, a number of investigations have demonstrated the increasing capability of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography to examine protein­DNA interactions (3, 4). We have studied a DNA complex of transcription factor 1 (TF1), a DBP II protein, by NMR, and have developed a model of its DNA binding based on experimentally determined intermolecular contacts. TF1 (encoded by the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage SPO1) (5, 6), HU (encoded by Bacillus stearothermophilus (Bst.) and Escherichia coli) (7, 8), and integration host factor (IHF) (encoded by E. coli) (8, 9) are the most studied of the type II DNA-binding proteins. While these three proteins are proposed to bind DNA in the same general manner, they exhibit different biological functions. Various HU proteins (ca. 20 kDa) exist as homodimers or as heterodimers of closely related subunits; IHF (21.9 kDa) forms a heterodimer (10, 11), and TF1 (22 kDa) forms a homodimer. While HU does not exhibit sequence-specificity in DNA binding (12), IHF (13) and TF1 display sequence-specificity. All DBP II proteins, however, are predicted to have a preference in binding to a DNA with enhanced flexibility. This could account for the presence of A-T base pairs in the binding sites of IHF and the specific binding of HU to DNA that contains single-stranded nicks or gaps (14). In addition, TF1 binds preferentially to DNA containing 5-hydroxymethyl-2 -deoxyuridine (HmU) in place of thymine (5). While the amino acid sequences of the DBP II proteins are highly conserved, these three prototypes do differ significantly near their carboxyl termini: HU monomers, IHFa and IHFb, and TF1 monomers consist of 89­94 (15), 98 and 93, and 99 amino acids, respectively. Our current understanding of the structural features of DBP II protein family has been derived primarily from structural studies of HU and IHF. It has been shown that HU perturbs the overall structure

of duplex DNA from linear to bent during binding (16, 17). The structure of the Bst-encoded HU protein has been solved by X ray (18) and NMR (19, 20). The structure suggests a novel mode of interaction with DNA, one in which a pair of two-stranded b-ribbon arms (amino acids 52 ­ 77) encircle the DNA double helix. These b-ribbon arm regions were not resolved in the original crystallography-derived structure, indicating flexibility. Like HU, IHF perturbs the shape of duplex DNA. Detailed studies, however, demonstrate that this perturbation does not affect the overall topology of DNA as HU does (21). Based on footprinting, photochemical crosslinking, and electrophoresis mobility measurements and genetic analysis (8), Nash and Yang (11) proposed a model for the interaction of IHF with a 28to 30-base-pair (bp) DNA site, in which the main features are the following: the close contacts of IHF with the DNA site are located in the b-ribbon arms and the carboxy-terminal a-helix, IHF protein contacts the DNA through the minor groove, and the DNA bends around the protein at least 140 . Cocrystals of IHF with a preferred binding site in a 35-bp DNA fragment have been prepared. The structure of IHF bound to this 35bp fragment has been recently solved by X-ray crystallography (22). The DNA is bent more than 160 , making a U-turn around the protein. There is considerable evidence that the mode of binding of TF1 is similar to that of HU and IHF. TF1 was suggested to bend DNA based on the enhancement of the time-resolved fluorescence polarization anisotropy of intercalated ethidium, indicating a substantial decrease in the average DNA torsional flexibility in the SPO1 DNA ­ TF1 complex (23). Schneider et al. (24) studied the bending of the DNA when TF1 binds at a preferred site in HmU-containing DNA by analyzing the electrophoretic mobilities of TF1 complex. This study shows that TF1 bends DNA very sharply. The magnitude of the bending angle and the size of the binding site suggest that the DNA makes multiple contacts with a TF1 dimer. In addition, it has been suggested that the b-ribbon arms and a-helix ``tails'' of the TF1 dimer are involved in these contacts with the DNA (24). Sequence-specific 1H and 15N NMR assignments were determined for TF1 (25, 26). The structure of TF1 has been recently solved by NMR, closely resembling the Bst­HU structure, except for the nine-amino-acid tail of TF1 (amino acids 91­99) (27). The nine-aminoacid tail forms an a-helical extension of a-helix 3 (amino acids 83­90) with a distortion at the amino acids 92 and 93 (27). The purpose of the study presented here is to develop a model of TF1/HmU-DNA binding based on experimental data of proton­proton distances between the two macromolecules and demonstrate that (i) both b-ribbon arm and a-helix tail resi-

dues are involved in the binding of the DNA, the bribbon arm region wraps around the DNA, and a considerable change in orientation of the a-helix tail region occurs upon DNA binding; (ii) Tyr-94 is in close proximity with the DNA in the bound complex; (iii) protein­ DNA contacts are established throughout the entire central 16 bp of the DNA which undergoes plane bending and bends around the core of the protein; and (iv) DNA bending begins at the HmU-A base pairs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of partially protiated TF1. In order to investigate the binding of DBP II proteins to DNA, selectively protiated TF1, IDFPQ-TF1, was produced in E. coli DL39 containing the TF1-overproducing plasmid pTF1X (28­30). Ile, Asp, Phe, Pro, and Gln were selected for protiation because these amino acids occur in the bribbon arms of TF1, the expected DNA-binding domain. Biosynthetic 2 H labeling can give rise to a significant amount of metabolic interconversion of protiated amino acids, resulting in additional protiated amino acids. This was taken into consideration during the assignment of resonances. NMR spectroscopy of TF1/HmU-DNA complex. The symmetric double-stranded DNA 16-mer (5 -CHmUCHmUACACGHmUGHmUAGAG-OH-3 )2 , designed to mimic a preferred TF1 binding site (24), was synthesized and its structure determined (31). Aliquots of 12­30 ml of a 2.5 mM protein stock solution of TF1 was added to 0.5 mM duplex HmU-DNA in 0.5 ml of 0.1 M NaCl which contained 10 mM NaN3 to inhibit bacterial growth. Binding of TF1 to the 16-mer was followed by carrying out one- and two-dimensional NMR experiments, and spectra were acquired at 20 and 27 C, respectively (data not shown). Spectra were collected on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer with a proton frequency of 500.13 MHz. The carrier frequency in the proton channel was set on the water resonance. Two-dimensional NOESY (nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy) spectra were obtained at [IDFPQ-TF1]:[HmU-DNA] ratio of 1.34:1 in both H2O and D2O. No changes in the 1H NMR resonance positions were observed after lyophilization, indicating that the resolubilized protein­DNA complex retains its native conformation. NMR samples contained 0.1 M NaCl and 10 mM NaN3 to inhibit bacterial growth. Assignment of intramolecular NOEs of TF1/HmU-DNA complex. Resonance assignments for TF1 and HmU-DNA binding site were obtained from previously published reports (25­27, 31). These assignments were initially compared to protein and HmU-DNA resonances in spectra of the TF1/HmU-DNA complex in order to identify spin systems associated with each amino acid and nucleotide. Resonances of the amino acids and nucleotides of the TF1/HmU-DNA complex were then accomplished by identification of the individual spin systems in the spectra of TF1/HmU-DNA complex. Once the individual resonances of TF1 and HmU-DNA for the bound state were located, we assigned the NOE cross peaks connecting these individual components. We were able to assign nine NOE cross peaks between TF1 and HmU-DNA. Virtually all resonances in the TF1/ HmU-DNA complex spectra could be identified thus NOEs between DNA and protein could be clearly distinguished from any intermolecular NOEs (protein or DNA). Molecular dynamics. In order to analyze the mode of binding and bending, and the major structural changes of TF1 and HmU-DNA upon binding, we calculated a model based on these intermolecular NOE cross peaks. The model of the TF1/HmU-DNA complex was derived in a twostage procedure: orientation determination and energy minimization. The general assumption of symmetry was made. This is a reasonable assumption based on the NMR data. Typically, formation of nonsymmetric complexes results in splitting of single peaks into two

bone dihedral angle constraints were determined from 15NH exchange data (26). Interstrand, inter- and intranucleotide for free HmU-DNA were determined from NOESY spectra obtained using 80 ms mixing time in H2O and D2O (31) and dihedral angle constraints were determined from DQF COSY spectra in D2O (31). Intermolecular NOEs were identified from NOESY spectra of the TF1/ HmU-DNA complex as described above. Molecular modeling was performed on a SGI Challenge compute server using MSI software (InsightII 95.0, Discover 2.9.7). The relative energies varied from 1800 to 34,000 kcal. Those models with associated energies of less than 2400 kcal were pooled and orientation of the DNA was noted. This orientation was used in subsequent modeling. The second stage consisted of the docking of the oriented DNA with 10 different open conformations of TF1 followed by the same energy minimization protocol mentioned above. The DNA was placed in a different orientation each time with pairwise displacement rang° ing from 2.0 to 11.1 A from the average orientation. Ten final models ° were obtained with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 2.48 A ° (all atoms) for the DNA and 2.05 A (all atoms) for the protein.

RESULTS

1D Titration of TF1 with HmU-DNA Binding of TF1 to the 16-mer was followed by onedimensional NMR experiments at 20 C. Figure 1 shows the spectral changes in HmU-DNA aliphatic resonances upon addition of IDFPQ-TF1 protein. Two changes can be detected: (i) line width broadening of HmU-DNA resonances, and (ii) additional peaks not associated with either TF1 or HmU-DNA free in solution (resonances around 0.9 and 0.5 ppm in Fig. 1). Both of these changes indicate the presence of a third species, the TF1/HmU-DNA complex. Intermolecular NOEs NOESY spectra of the bound complex at TF1:HmUDNA ratio of 1.34:1 acquired in both H2O and D2O show evidence of nine NOE cross peaks (per monomer) between the protein and the DNA (see Table I).

IDFPQ-TF1 protein was added until a protein ratio of 1.34 was achieved (B­H). The 1D spectrum of IDFPQ-TF1 free in solution (I) is shown in order to demonstrate that additional resonances appear in the spectra of TF1 or HmU-DNA free in solution (see H, resonance 1).

peaks. Splitting of resonances was not observed during the formation of the complex by one- or two-dimensional NMR. In the first stage, a standard TF1 binding site B­DNA duplex (modified to reflect HmU residues) was generated using MSI software (InsightII 95.0). Counterions were included for the HmU-DNA. An ``open'' conformation, in which the two b-ribbon arms are extended, was chosen as the starting TF1 model (27). Fourteen starting Cartesian coordinate files were generated. In each file the DNA was ° placed at least 30 A away from the protein and in a different orienta° tion, with pairwise displacements ranging from 6.8 to 97 A from the average placement. The CFF91 forcefield (32, 33) was applied to all starting files. Docking of the DNA and TF1 was carried out by energy minimization. The first 1000 steps were carried out using the method of steepest descent, and this was followed by 10,000 steps of conjugate gradients minimization until the maximum derivative in the ° gradient was 0.01 kcal mol01 A01. The NOE constraints determined for the free TF1 (dimer) and HmU-DNA along with the 18 experimen° tally determined intermolecular NOEs set at 5 A were applied during minimization. All distance constraints for free TF1 were extracted from a series of previously determined NOESY spectra (with mixing times of 75, 100, 150, and 200 ms) for each of eight selectively deuterated TF1 variants (26). Inter- and intramonomeric NOEs were determined using isotopic double half-filter NMR techniques (27). Back-

Molecular Dynamics Initial molecular dynamics were carried out on TF1 and HmU-DNA with the two components placed randomly in space as described in detail under Materials and Methods. Energy minimization with the application of all known intra- and intermolecular constraints resulted in relative energies varying from 1800 to 34,000 kcal. Those models with associated energies of less than 2400 kcal were pooled and orientation of the DNA was noted. This calculation indicates that the DNA binds between the two b-ribbon arms as previously proposed. This orientation was utilized in subsequent energy minimization calculations. Ten final models were obtained with an rmsd ° ° of 2.48 A (all atoms) for the DNA and 2.05 A (all atoms) for the protein. The use of experimental NMR data clearly limits the conformational space to be searched, thus improving the accuracy of the docking simulation over those models generated without experimental data. Figure 3 shows the result of this modeling. Three features in particular are to be noted. The b-ribbon arms show less variation of orientation and conformation than in the free TF1, and are in association with the DNA. The two a-helices that composed the tail drastically change their positions, moving toward the DNA. The HmUDNA is also close to the a-helix tail of TF1, as shown in Fig. 3.
DISCUSSION

FIG. 2. Expanded region of the NOESY spectrum in D2O at 27 C showing NOEs between HmU-DNA and IDFPQ-TF1 protein. The spectrum was recorded at protein:DNA ratio of 1.34:1. This section displays NOE crosspeaks between (i) Ala-98 Ha and G16 H1 and (ii) Ala-89 Ha and C3 H1 . Additional resonances seen in this expansion have been assigned and belong to the HmU-DNA.

ment of these intramolecular NOEs was accomplished by a detailed analysis of the spin systems of both the DNA and the protein in the TF1/HmU-DNA complex spectra. An example of this is depicted in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2 a portion of the spin systems associated with cytidine 1 (H1 to H2 , and H1 to H2 NOEs) can be seen. None of the intermolecular NOEs are observed in the core of the protein (a-helix 1, first turn, a-helix 2, second turn, and b-sheet 1 of each monomer). Two NOEs involve amino acids Pro-52 and Gln-66 in the flexible b-ribbon arm of the protein. One NOE arises from an amino acid in b-sheet 2, Ile-50, located at the base of the b-ribbon arm. The other NOEs arise from amino acids, Ala-89, Glu-90, Leu-92, Tyr-94, and Ala-98, in the C terminal a-helix tail of the protein (Fig. 2). As noted above, linewidth broadening occurs during the formation of the protein­DNA complex due to the higher molecular weight of the protein­DNA complex. The resulting difficulty of broad NOEs can usually be dealt with by increasing concentrations of NaCl. In this case, however, gel retardation studies indicate that NaCl concentrations greater than 0.1 M result in loss of DNA binding (data not shown). Thus, while NOE crosspeaks are broad in spectra acquired at NaCl concentration appropriate for this study, they are sufficiently resolved to enable assignment. It should be noted that since selective partial protiation is necessary in order to achieve spectral resolution of such complex systems, the set of intermolecular NOE's generated is considered to be a subset of all potential contacts.

These data confirm the predictions, based on IHF (11), that the b-ribbon arm and a-helix tail regions of TF1 are involved in DNA binding. It is interesting that six of the nine NOEs (per monomer) are located in this a-helix tail of TF1, a region missing or truncated in HU and IHFb, reinforcing the suggestion that the ahelix tail region of TF1 may play a critical role in differences in function, specificity, affinity, and structure of the DBP II family of proteins (24). It is also very interesting to note that the bound DNA shows intermolecular NOEs with base pairs distributed along the entire 16-mer, showing continuous contacts with the protein. In this model (Figs. 3A, 3B, and 3C), HmU-DNA binds between the b-ribbon arms (amino acids 52­77) and bends along the core of TF1, suggesting that the lateral surface of the core region may play a critical role in DNA binding. Figures 3A, 3B, and 3C display different orientations of the model of the complex. The model indicates that the HmU-DNA bends in the plane (approximately two 60 bends) around TF1 (Fig. 3A), is displaced out of this plane by 30 , and undergoes over- and undertwisting. Figure 4 displays the change in the orientation of the bases in the DNA. Interestingly, we observe that the bound HmU-DNA shows the highest degree of bending throughout the terminal 4

DNA flexibility (31). In recent DNA affinity studies greater flexibility in this region has been shown to increase TF1 binding (34). DNA sites consisting of mismatch-loops separated by 9 bp increase the affinity for TF1 to thymine-containing DNA. Several structural changes in the protein are evident upon binding. Figure 3D depicts the superimposition of TF1 monomer in the unbound (white) and the bound (pink) states. The core of TF1 does not change significantly between the unbound and the bound states. Significant changes occur, however, in the b-ribbon arm and the a-helix tail. Comparison of the models of free and DNA-bound TF1 indicates that the a-helix tail ° (amino acids 83­99) moves by up to 14.5 A and changes orientation relative to the b-sheet 3 (amino acids 78­ 82) by approximately 60 during binding (Fig. 5). We found two NOE cross peaks in the complex between Tyr-94 and HmU-DNA, verifying that Tyr-94 is in close proximity to DNA in the bound complex. Previous data suggested that Tyr-94 is of intermediate mobility, suggesting that solvent is accessible in the free dimer (25). Fluorescence studies (28) also indicated that in the bound state Tyr-94 is located in the vicinity

Change in orientation of the a-helix ``tail'' during binding (also seen in Fig. 3D, white square), depicting the degree of movement of the a-helix ``tail'' of TF1 from the unbound (A) to the bound form (B). Comparison of the change in angle between a-helix ``tail'' and b-sheet 3 was performed by superimposing the b-sheet 3 of the unbound (A) and bound (B) models. The model indicates that there is a 60 change in the relative orientation of the a-helix ``tail'' and the b-sheet during binding.

start of the bending of HmU-DNA is located at the positions 5 -HmU4-A5-3 and 5 -HmU12-A13-3 ; (x) the TF1 b-ribbon arm region is less flexible in the bound state; and (xi) considerable change in the relative orientation of the a-helix tail region occurs upon DNA binding. It should be mentioned that while this particular study of the TF1/HmU-DNA complex by NMR clearly shows the overall features of the binding mentioned above, the data represent only a subset of all contacts between protein and DNA. This occurs due to the partial deuteration required for spectral resolution of a large system such as this. Studies utilizing other isotope labeling and patterns will surely provide additional information regarding the binding. In addition, the use of a longer piece of DNA will provide additional information about contacts with the core of TF1. The growing understanding of these intermolecular interactions provides the basis for our understanding of gene regulation.

of DNA in the complex. Thus, our data confirm that Tyr-94 is in close contact with the DNA during binding and supports the previously proposed model that Tyr94 moves from a solvent-accessible to a solvent-inaccessible position during binding (25, 28). Figure 3E depicts the comparison of a DNA footprinting study (24) and the TF1/HmU-DNA model. DNA has been colored to reflect the unprotected (blue) residues determined by hydroxyl radical cleavage and methylation interference in both the free and bound DNA models (24). This display shows that those residues found to be protected in footprinting lay along the protein binding pocket while those residues found to be unprotected in the footprinting studies lie furthest from the protein binding pocket (24). In conclusion, based on the observed intermolecular NOEs, this model provides the following information regarding TF1 binding: (i) both b-ribbon arm and ahelix tail residues are involved in the binding of the central 16 bp of the DNA; (ii) protein­DNA contacts are established throughout the entire central 16 bp of the DNA; (iii) TF1 b-ribbon arms wrap around the DNA as described in models of other DBP II proteins (11, 35); (iv) the TF1/HmU-DNA solution complex appears similar to the IHF complex in the crystal form (22); (v) Tyr-94 is in close proximity, based on observed NOEs, with the DNA in the bound complex; (vi) the central 16 bp of TF1-bound DNA undergoes plane bending of 60 at the 5 -HmU4-3 base pair, and 60 at the 5 -A133 base pair; (vii) the DNA is bent around the core of the protein; (viii) the DNA bending involves a displacement of 30 out of the plane at the 5 -HmU4-3 base pair, and also 30 at the 5 -A13-3 base pair; (ix) the
