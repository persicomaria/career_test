Abstract cDNAs specifying four active phosphoribosyl diphosphate synthase isozymes were isolated from an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library. In contrast to other phosphoribosyl diphosphate synthases the activity of two of the A. thaliana isozymes are independent of Pi . Amino acid sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis indicate that these two isozymes belong to a novel class of phosphoribosyl diphosphate synthases. ß 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Ribosyl-K-1-diphosphate (RPP) is required for the de novo biosynthesis and salvage of purine, pyrimidine and pyridine nucleotides, as well as for the synthesis of histidine and tryptophan [1]. PRPP synthase (EC 2.7.6.1) catalyses the formation of PRPP by transfer of an intact diphosphoryl group from ATP to Rib-5-P [2]: Rib-5-P+ATPCPRPP+AMP. PRPP synthase is believed to be essential for all free living

organisms, and, consequently, these organisms contain at least one PRS gene specifying PRPP synthase. Only the two obligate intracellular parasitic microorganisms Chlamydia trachomatis and Rickettsia prowazekii appear to lack PRPP synthase [3,4]. Several eukaryotic organisms have more than one PRS gene. The mammals Rattus norvegicus and Homo sapiens contain two and three PRS genes, respectively [5^7]. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains ¢ve genes whose products show a high degree of sequence similarity with PRPP synthases [8]. Genome sequencing has revealed at least two PRS genes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and two PRS genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In the present study we describe the cloning and sequencing of four Arabidopsis thaliana PRPP synthase-encoding cDNAs and analyse their synthesis in Escherichia coli. In addition, the A. thaliana genome sequencing project has revealed a ¢fth member of this new gene

family. This gene, which we designate PRS5, is located on chromosome II. Wild-type A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia) cDNA fragments harboured in the VYES vector were provided by R.W. Davis (Stanford University, California, USA) [9]. This V vector contains lox sites of the bacteriophage P1 site-speci¢c recombination system at each end of an inserted plasmid (pSE936). Following infection, the DNA between the lox sites may loop out of the V phage to form a plasmid, provided that the cre gene, another component of the P1 sitespeci¢c recombination system is supplied in trans. The cre gene may be provided by VKC. A lac promoter is positioned to allow expression of the cloned DNA fragment. To clone PRPP synthase encoding genes by complementation, a VKC lysogen of E. coli strain HO773 (vprs-4) [10] was infected with the cDNA library at a multiplicity of infection of 0.006. Plasmid DNA was allowed to loop out and express ampicillin resistance followed by plating in NZY medium containing ampicillin (100 Wg/ml) [11]. Strain HO773 requires guanosine, uridine, histidine, tryptophan and NAD. Guanosine, uridine, histidine and tryptophan are present in NZY medium, whereas NAD is not. Thus Prs transformants can be selected on NZY medium [12]. Complementing PRS cDNA-harbouring V phages appeared at a frequency of approximately 7U1036 . Plasmid DNA was puri¢ed from the 66 transformants obtained and submitted to restriction endonuclease digestion, which revealed the presence of four di¡erent cDNAs. The four cDNAs were designated PRS1, PRS2,
6

PRS3 and PRS4 and their gene products PRPP synthase isozyme 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Plasmids harbouring a representative of each cDNA were chosen for further analysis: pHO254 (PRS1), pHO257 (PRS2), pHO275 (PRS4) and pHO300 (PRS3). The nucleotide sequences were determined on both strands with complete overlaps by cycle sequencing with dye terminators using a Model 377 Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The four PRS cDNAs varied in length from 1190 to 1382 bp. Each sequence contained one open reading frame su¤cient in length to code for a PRPP synthase polypeptide (Fig. 1). The sequences around the proposed initiation AUG codons of PRS3 and PRS4 were almost identical to the consensus initiation sequence (AACAAUGGC) [13], whereas the sequence around the proposed initiation AUG codon of PRS1 poorly matched the consensus initiation sequence described above. Sequence analysis revealed that PRS2 speci¢ed a polypeptide with translation initiating from lac sequences of the vector and with nine amino acids fused to the amino-terminal end of the sequence shown in Fig. 1. The mRNA sequences of PRS1, PRS3 and PRS4 each contained a polyadenylate sequence at their 3P end. Polyadenylation signals [14] were found less than 30 nucleotides upstream of the 5P ends of polyA sequences of the PRS1 (AAUAUA) and PRS3 (AAUAAU) mRNAs. Possible polyadenylation signals were found further upstream in PRS2 and PRS4 mRNAs (data not shown).

The open reading frames of the four PRS cDNAs accommodate polypeptides with calculated molecular masses: 38 247 Da (PRS1), 33 782 Da (PRS2), 35 946 Da (PRS3) and 37 536 Da (PRS4). In addition, PRS5, which is a computer-assisted generation of the coding sequence derived from the genome se-

quence, speci¢ed a polypeptide of 41 812 Da. The deduced amino acid sequences of PRPP synthase isozyme 1 and 2 are 96% similar, whereas the similarity of the gene product of PRS5 with isozyme 1 and 2 is 81% and 88%, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences of isozymes 3 and 4 are 71% similar. In

contrast, the similarity of isozyme 1, 2 or the gene product of PRS5 with isozyme 3 or 4 is only 21% to 26%. The sequence motifs for binding of divalent cation-nucleotide (Fig. 1, Region A) [15] and PRPP/Rib-5-P (Fig. 1, Region B) [15,16] could be identi¢ed in all ¢ve sequences. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the four A. thaliana PRPP synthase isozymes and the deduced amino acid sequence of the A. thaliana PRS5 open reading frame with the amino acid sequences of 21 PRPP synthases from 17 other organisms is shown in Fig. 1. Only seven amino acids are identical in all 26 sequences. Two of these, His-168 and Phe-176 of the A. thaliana isozyme 1, are located within the divalent cation^nucleotide binding site, and two, Asp-259 and Asp-260 of the A. thaliana isozyme 1, are located within the PRPP/Rib-5-P binding motif. In addition Pro-128, Gly-211 and Leu-275 of the A. thaliana isozyme 1 are conserved as well. However, extensive homology is found when pairwise comparisons are performed. The comparison shown in Fig. 1 reveals that amino acids are conserved throughout the entire sequence with a clustering of similarity around the seven residues mentioned above. Apart from the identi¢cation of the divalent cation^nucleotide binding site, the PRPP/Rib-5-P binding motif and the proposal of amino acids involved in ATP binding (Fig. 1, Regions 1, 2 and 3) [5], little is known about the function of these conserved amino acids. The phylogenetic relationship of A. thaliana PRPP synthase isozymes to PRPP synthase sequences from 31 di¡erent organisms was analysed (Fig. 2). The phylogenetic relationship suggests that an ancestral PRPP synthase polypeptide may have evolved into six families: (i) A. thaliana isozymes 3 and 4 are
6

resolved as a divergent branch forming a separate family re£ecting a dissimilarity to any other PRPP synthase sequence; (ii) A. thaliana isozymes 1, 2 and 5 together with the enzymes from Synechococcus and Synechocystis, which are also photosynthetic organisms, constitute a subfamily closely related to the subfamilies of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; (iii) vertebrates, nematodes and fungi. The human and rat PAP sequences belong to a separate branch. These polypeptides, which show a high degree of similarity with PRPP synthases, are catalytically inactive; (iv) Borrelia burgdorferi and Treponema pallidum; (v) Archaea, represented by Pyrococcus sp., Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum and Archaeoglobus fulgidus; (vi) Leishmania donovani, Mycoplasma genitalium, M. pneumoniae and Giardia intestinalis. The phylogenetic tree of all reported PRPP synthase polypeptides con¢rms the general evolutionary relationship, as the major grouping within eubacterial and eukaryotic domains is maintained. PRPP synthase activity speci¢ed by the four A. thaliana PRS cDNAs harboured in the PRPP-less E. coli strain HO773 was assayed in vitro in crude extracts by the procedure described previously [17]. Pi -Independent conditions were obtained by dialysis of extracts against Pi -free Tris^HCl bu¡er (pH 7.6). All four PRPP synthase isozymes were able to produce PRPP in a Rib-5-P-dependent manner. The activity of PRPP synthase isozymes 1 and 2 was 470 and 130 nmol/min per mg protein, respectively, when assayed in the presence of Pi . In the absence of Pi the activity was only 2% of the activity obtained with Pi present. The activity of isozyme 3 was 660 nmol/min per mg protein in the presence of Pi and 760 nmol/

min per mg protein in the absence of Pi . The activity of isozyme 4 was 68 nmol/min per mg protein in the presence of Pi and 49 nmol/min per mg protein in the absence of Pi . PRPP synthase isozymes 1 and 2 resemble the `classical' PRPP synthases from bacteria and mammals, which are dependent on Pi for activity. In contrast, isozymes 3 and 4 appeared to be independent of Pi for activity. This Pi -independent behaviour of PRPP synthase isozymes 3 and 4 is novel among PRPP synthases. We suggest that the A. thaliana isozymes 3 and 4 constitute a novel class of PRPP synthases based on both their low sequence similarity and apparent phylogenetic divergence from the bacterial and mammalian PRPP synthases as well as their independence of Pi for activity. We are grateful to Ron Davis for generously providing the A. thaliana gene library. Tonny D. Hansen and Anne L. MÖller are acknowledged for pertinent technical assistance. We thank Jim McGuire for careful reading of the manuscript.
