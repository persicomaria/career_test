Figure S1. Stereo representations showing the active-site region of the IPNS:FeII:L -TBH com plex: A) The IPNS:FeII :L -TBH complex with an with mFo-DFc difference electron density map calculated from a simulated-annealing refinement using CNS [34] of a model with the atoms within 3.5 A of the substrate and iron omitted, contoured at 2.5 sigma (green mesh). B) an overlay structure showing IPN 2 (green) and L -TBH 4 (blue) overlaid to compare binding of the two compounds in the IPNS active site. Water molecules included in this figure are those within 3 Å of substrate or iron(II) (orange); water molecules in salmon-pink are those from the cyclobutanone complex, those in red are from the IPN complex.
