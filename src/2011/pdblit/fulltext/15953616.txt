The multidomain E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 catalyzes p53 ubiquitination by a "dual-site" docking mechanism whereby MDM2 binding to at least two distinct peptide motifs on p53 promotes ubiquitination. One protein­protein interaction occurs between the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 and the transactivation motif of p53, and the second interaction occurs between the acidic domain of MDM2 and a motif in the DNA-binding domain of p53. A flexible N-terminal pseudo-substrate or "lid" adjacent to the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 has a phosphorylation site, and there are distinct models proposed on how the phosphorylated lid could affect MDM2 function. Biochemical studies have predicted that phosphomimetic mutation will stabilize the lid on the surface of MDM2 and will "open" the hydrophobic pocket and stabilize the MDM2­p53 complex, while NMR studies proposed that phosphomimetic mutation "closes" the lid over the MDM2 pocket and inhibits MDM2­p53 complex formation. To resolve these discrepancies, we utilized a quantitative fluorescence-based dye binding assay to measure the thermal unfolding of wild-type (wt), Lid, and S17D N-terminal domains of MDM2 as a function of increasing ligand concentration. Our data reveal that S17D lid mutation increases, rather than decreases, the thermostability of the N-terminal domain of MDM2 in the absence or in the presence of ligand. Lid mutation, by contrast, increases MDM2 thermoinstability. This is consistent with biochemical data, using full-length MDM2, showing that the S17D mutation stabilizes the MDM2­ p53 complex and increases the specific activity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase function of MDM2. These data indicate that phosphomimetic lid mutation results in an "opening," rather than a "closing," of the pocket of MDM2 and highlight the ability of small intrinsically disordered or unstructured peptide motifs to regulate the specific activity of a protein.

cytokine signaling, and metabolic change.1 The induction and suppression of hundreds of p53responsive genes coordinately mediate cellular repair and survival or cell death.2 As such, the activity of p53 is under strict control through a negative feedback loop driven by the oncoprotein MDM2, which suppresses the full activity of p53 under nonstressed conditions. MDM2 is a multidomain protein that is involved in a range of protein­protein interactions that control gene expression and regulate protein half-life. These domains include (i) an N-terminal hydrophobic pocket that drives protein­protein interactions between MDM2 and proteins such as p53 with the peptide-binding consensus FxxxWxxL;3,4 (ii) a central domain rich in acidic amino acids that directs

Mutation of the MDM2 Lid Stabilizes Ligand Binding

415 R175H murine equivalent allele transgenic animals sensitize the mutant p53 to enhanced MDM2-dependent degradation in normal murine transgenes.15 These data highlight a dual-site mechanism of p53mediated ubiquitination by MDM2 and the importance of p53 conformation in vivo in sensitizing it to MDM2-mediated ubiquitination. However, the ubiquitin ligase CHIP can also interact directly with MDM2 to regulate p53 folding in vitro14 and in vivo,16,17 suggesting that mutant p53 ubiquitination will involve an in vivo interplay between MDM2 and the chaperone degradation machinery. In order to understand how this dual-site mechanism of MDM2 is regulated, we can turn our attention to characterizing additional regulatory motifs built into the three subdomains of MDM2 reviewed above. The RING domain has an imbedded ATP motif that regulates the molecular chaperone function of MDM2.18,19 The central acidic domain of MDM2 has a flanking highly conserved zinc finger20 whose mutation alters MDM2 interaction with ribosomal proteins and regulates ribosomal stress response.21 The N-terminal hydrophobic pocket has an adjacent pseudo-substrate motif or "lid" that can regulate the conformation of the hydrophobic pocket.22 Of these three motifs, only the effects of the N-terminal lid on E3 ubiquitin ligase function have so far been analyzed biochemically.23 The N-terminal domain of MDM2 containing the hydrophobic pocket is conformationally flexible, and it was shown through NMR that this minidomain can adopt different conformations depending on the length of the peptide in its hydrophobic pocket.24 Molecular dynamic modeling also highlighted the striking flexibility of the N-terminal MDM2 domain when bound to ligand.25 MDM2 has a PI3-kinase-like phosphorylation site within the Lid at serine 17 whose function in cells is not well defined. 26 Another NMR study highlighted a phosphomimetic mutation (S17D) in the so-called N-terminal pseudo-substrate motif or "lid" that changed the conformation of the N-terminal domain of MDM2. This mutation in the lid was predicted to drive the lid to cover the hydrophobic pocket and to destabilize the MDM2­p53 complex. Indeed, with the use of NMR on apo-MDM2 domain, the MDM2 lid was shown to predominate over the pocket but to also exist in equilibrium outside the pocket.27,28 However, subsequent biochemical studies have shown that this phosphomimetic mutation actually stabilizes the MDM2­tetrameric p53 complex by a mechanism that appears to drive the lid equilibrium to interact with basic amino acids on the surface of the N-terminal lobe.23 This was supported by making an artificial MDM2 mutant protein with MDM4 equivalent substitutions at codons 97 and 98: this mutant MDM2 was refractory to the activating effects of the S17D mutation.23 In the latter report, it was also shown that the S17D-Lid mutation in fulllength MDM2 increases the affinity of MDM2 for peptides derived from the ubiquitination signal in the DNA-binding domain of p53. Presumably, allosteric effects induced by the S17D mutation

MDM2 binding to a large range of signaling enzymes that can contain the generalized consensus SxxLxGxxxF;5­7 and (iii) a C-terminal RING finger domain that forms a C2H2C4 dimeric protein­protein interaction domain.8 The N-terminal domain of MDM2 mediates the ability of MDM2 to suppress the transcriptional activity of p53 through binding of MDM2 to the transcriptional activation domain of p53.9 Drugs like Nutlin-3 can compete with p53 binding to MDM2 and result in the release of p53 from negative control by MDM2.10 The central acidic region forms a domain that promotes binding of MDM2 protein to the ubiquitination signal in the DNA-binding domain of p53.5­7 Together, these three domains of MDM2 play critical roles in controlling the specific activity of MDM2 as a p53 inhibitor. Multiprotein-catalyzed ubiquitination is an enzymatic reaction mechanism that is challenging to solve. The general players have been defined and include (i) a limited number of so-called E1 components that form the first thiol­ester ubiquitin transfer scaffold; (ii) more diverse sets of E2 components that accept the transfer of ubiquitin, which in turn interacts with an E3 component; and (iii) an E3 component like a HECT domain that directly forms either a covalent linkage with ubiquitin that precedes substrate ubiquitination or a RING-like domain that acts as a scaffold for allowing E2-mediated ubiquitin transfer to substrate.11 The detailed dynamics and allosteric properties of these multicomponent protein­protein interactions are largely undefined. MDM2 forms a model E3 ubiquitin ligase that can be used to understand the dynamics of a ubiquitination reaction. Its substrate, p53, is tetrameric, and monomeric forms of p53 cannot function as substrates for MDM2-mediated p53 degradation12 or p53 ubiquitination.13 However, whether p53 tetramers dissociate into monomers or dimers upon interaction with MDM2 is not known, but it has previously been shown that MDM2 can cooperate with HSP90 and CHIP to "unfold" p53 tetramers.14 Thus, changes in p53 tetramer structure might play a role in priming the substrate p53 for ubiquitin transfer by the MDM2­E2­ubiquitin complex. The features that regulate this oligomerization dependence in ubiquitination are undefined, since there is no available structure of the full-length MDM2­p53 complex. MDM2 itself has two distinct docking sites in p53 that are required for ubiquitination; an interaction with the N-terminus of p53 induces undefined allosteric effects that can drive MDM2 docking to a "ubiquitination signal" in the DNA-binding domain of p53.6 It is not known whether these docking sites form intramolecular or intermolecular scaffolds for MDM2. Furthermore, mutations in p53 that destabilize the folding of the p53 tetramer (F270A, within the second MDM2 binding site in p53, or R175H, a conformationally destabilizing mutant that opens the second MDM2 binding site) render p53 sensitive to hyperubiquitination in cancer cell lines,13 and

416 "open" the acidic domain of MDM2, but the molecular basis for this effect on the MDM2mediated dual-site ubiquitination reaction is not defined. In this current report, we subject the isolated N-terminal domain of MDM2 to solution-phase ligand binding assays to determine whether the phosphomimetic mutation in the pseudo-substrate motif stabilizes or destabilizes the interaction of the isolated N-terminal domain of MDM2 with its ligands. It remained possible that other domains of MDM2, such as the RING or acidic domain, were essential for the phosphomimetic lid effects on MDM2 binding to p53. Our data indicate that ligand binding increases the thermal stability of the isolated MDM2 N-terminal domain and that the S17D mutation in the pseudo-substrate motif further elevates the thermostability of the N-terminal domain. These data are consistent with the model indicating that phosphomimetic mutation on the N-terminal pseudo-substrate motif directly effects the N-terminal MDM2 domain conformation, "opens" the hydrophobic pocket, and stabilizes the full-length MDM2­p53 complex.

Mutation of the MDM2 Lid Stabilizes Ligand Binding

Results and Discussion
S17D mutation increases the thermal stability of the N-terminal peptide-binding domain of MDM2 As reported previously,23 phosphomimetic mutation of full-length MDM2 at codon 17 (S17D) produces a protein that forms a more stable complex with tetrameric full-length p53 (Fig. 1a). This enhanced binding of full-length MDM2 as a result of the S17D mutation also increases its stability for the FxxxWxxL motif3,4 in the BOX-I domain of p53 (Fig. 1b) and for the SxxLxGxxxF motif5­7 in the BOX-V domain of p53 (Fig. 1b).23 Enhanced BOX-I binding is attributed to binding by the N-terminal domain of MDM2 (amino acids 1­110), and enhanced BOX-V binding is attributed to an interaction of the acidic domain (amino acids 220­300) of MDM2 with the core DNA-binding domain of p53 (Fig. 1b).6 Based on the known flexibility of the MDM2 lid,27,28 we identified surface residues at codons 97 and 98 that might form salt bridges with the phosphomimetic lid motif and maintain the MDM2 hydrophobic pocket in an "open" conformation (Fig. 1c).23 This model is distinct from that based on an NMR study of the isolated S17DMDM21­126 domain, where data were interpreted to suggest that the phosphomimetic mutant lid (S17D) was stabilized over the MDM2 pocket and that this would prevent p53 binding to MDM2 (Fig. 1d).22 All of the abovesummarized research demonstrating enhanced binding of S17D-MDM2 to p53 was evaluated using full-length untagged MDM2 protein. It is not known therefore whether (i) the isolated N-terminal domain of S17D-MDM2 (Fig. 1e) has an intrinsically higher affinity for the BOX-I domain of

p53 compared to full-length S17D-MDM2, or (ii) whether the isolated N-terminal domain of S17DMDM2 is in fact inactive in p53 binding because the phosphomimetic lid motif does in fact fit over the hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 and preclude p53 binding. For example, it is possible that the phosphomimetic lid equilibrium can change due to interdomain/intradomain interactions in full-length MDM2. Mutations in the RING domain increase the specific activity of full-length MDM2 in a BOX-I peptide binding assay and can change the conformation of MDM2 at amino acids 66­69.29 These latter data suggest the possibility that the enhanced binding of full-length S17D-MDM2 to p53 might require the RING domain. Thus, it is possible that both data have valid interpretations--that fulllength S17D-MDM2 might be more active in p53 binding because the phosphomimetic lid is stabilized outside the hydrophobic pocket,23 and that S17DMDM21­126 (i.e., in the absence of the RING domain) might be less active because the lid is stabilized over the pocket.22 To discriminate between these possibilities and to determine whether the S17D mutation has a localized effect on the N-terminal MDM2­domain interaction with ligands, we cloned and purified wt, S17D, and "Lid-deleted" versions of MDM21­126 (Fig. 1e) to evaluate their biophysical properties. The reduced electrophoretic mobility of S17D-MDM21­126 compared to that of wt-MDM21­126 (Fig. 1f) suggests that phosphomimetic mutation changes the conformation of the isolated MDM2 minidomain to alter its denaturation by SDS and resultant electrophoretic mobility, as reported for other phosphorylation sites on proteins.30 Using these three miniproteins, we evaluated whether the affinity of MDM2 variants for its ligands changes on thermal shift assays. These assays can measure the relative affinity of a ligand for a target protein based on the energetic coupling between ligand-binding reactions and heat-induced protein-unfolding reactions.31 An increase in protein denaturation or unfolding as a function of temperature can be measured by interactions with SYPRO Orange, a dye that binds to hydrophobically exposed or unfolded regions of proteins and results in fluorescence. 31 An increased mid-point melting temperature (Tm) of MDM21­126 due to phosphomimetic change (without a bound ligand) would indicate that the RING domain is not required for activating the effect of the S17D mutation and that localized conformational changes are induced in response to this lid mutation. By contrast, a decrease in the thermal shift transition of MDM21­126 due to the phosphomimetic change would suggest that the lid could lie over the pocket, destabilize MDM2, and reduce its specific activity as a p53 binding protein. The change in the binding of SYPRO Orange to wtMDM21­126 (in the absence of ligand), leading to fluorescence changes as a function of increasing temperature, highlights a relatively high level of fluorescence at low temperature that actually decreases generally as a function of increasing temperature (Fig. 2a; titration from 38 °C to 89 °C).

418 This high level of the basal binding of wt-MDM21­126 to SYPRO Orange at 38 °C (baseline fluorescence of approximately 3500­4200 U; see Fig. 2e, "0" ligand) is presumably due to an interaction of the hydrophobic pocket of native wt-MDM21­126 with SYPRO Orange, since the addition of ligands to wt-MDM21­126 substantially reduces the baseline fluorescence of the N-terminal domain at a nondenaturing temperature of 38 °C (Fig. 2e). Nutlin-3 suppresses the baseline fluorescence of SYPRO Orange MDM2 better than the p53-mimetic peptide 12.1 (Fig. 2e, left versus right), consistent with the higher affinity of Nutlin-3 for MDM2 than for the peptide. Despite the high basal level of fluorescence of wt-MDM21­126 at 38 °C in the absence of ligand, a single unfolding transition maximum can be observed for wt-MDM21­126 at 75 °C when the change in the rate of fluorescence is plotted as a function of increasing temperature (Fig. 2b). By contrast, S17D-MDM21­126 exhibits an unfolding transition at 77 °C (Fig. 2b), which is 2° higher that the wild-type (wt) counterpart. These data indicate that even in the absence of ligand, the phosphomimetic mutation in MDM2 can induce thermoresistance to the isolated MDM2 N-terminal domain and can induce localized changes in its conformational stability and that the RING domain is not essential for this effect. By contrast to the S17D mutation, deletion of the MDM2 lid (amino acids 1­24; Lid-MDM225­126) increases the thermoinstability of MDM2 by 9 °C (Fig. 2c and d; Table 1). These latter data indicate that the "Lid" can function as a positive regulatory domain and can have an intrinsic stabilizing effect on the MDM2 N-terminal domain. Effects of ligands on the thermal stability of the phosphomimetic mutant and the Lid deletion mutant of MDM2 Thermal shift assays were used to measure the effect of ligand (p53-mimetic peptide) binding on MDM2 thermostability. An increased thermal shift transition of MDM21­126 due to ligand binding would highlight a stabilizing effect of the ligand on thermostability. Indeed, with the use of wtMDM21­126 (compared to the single thermal shift phase maximum from 75 °C without ligand; Fig. 2),

Mutation of the MDM2 Lid Stabilizes Ligand Binding

there is a ligand-dose-dependent increase in thermal phase shift up to 78 °C as a function of increasing peptide concentration (Fig. 3a­c; Table 1). There is also a second ligand-dependent unfolding transition induced at approximately 50­53 °C that does not show ligand dose dependency at these concentrations of ligand (10­40 M) (Fig. 3a­c). The second ligand-dependent phase shift at lower temperature is suggestive of a biphasic denaturation pathway that involves possibly two different conformations of the ligand-bound MDM2. We next evaluated whether the phosphomimetic lid mutation increased or decreased the thermal shift of MDM2. An increased thermal shift (i.e., stabilizing effect) after ligand addition would indicate further that the RING domain is not required for activating the effect of the S17D mutation, and the N-terminal domain with the phosphomimetic mutation alone can recapitulate the behavior of full-length S17D-MDM2. However, a decrease in the mid-point melting temperature (Tm) of S17D-MDM21­126 would suggest that the lid might in fact cover the pocket on the truncated MDM2, consistent with the interpretation based on NMR. This might also infer that the RING domain could contribute to the ligand-bound thermal stability of full-length S17D-MDM2. When thermal shift assays were used to measure S17D-MDM21­126 stability, a trend similar to that obtained with wt-MDM21­126 was observed. First, compared to the single thermal shift phase maximum from 77 °C without ligand (Fig. 2), there is a ligand-dose-dependent increase in the thermal phase shift up to 80 °C as a function of increasing peptide concentration (Fig. 3a­c). The increase in the thermostability of S17D-MDM21­126 in the presence of ligand is consistent with the model indicating that phosphomimetic mutation induces a more stable complex between the N-terminal lid and the surface of MDM2 (Fig. 1c).23 This also indicates that the RING domain is not required for this allosteric effect. Interestingly, S17D-MDM21­126 also exhibited the second ligand-dependent unfolding transition induced at approximately 50­55 °C that does not show ligand dose dependency (Fig. 3a­c). Furthermore, this second ligand-dependent phase shift at 50­55 °C is not affected by the S17D mutation, as is

Mutation of the MDM2 Lid Stabilizes Ligand Binding

In order to further evaluate the relevance of the two-phase shifts in the presence of ligand, we performed the experiment above using Nutlin-3 instead of the p53-mimetic peptide. A qualitatively similar trend was observed, although Nutlin-3induced thermal shifts occurred at a higher temperature compared to the p53 peptide. This is consistent with the known higher affinity of Nutlin-3 for MDM2 relative to peptide and with the established ability of thermal shift assay to discriminate ligand affinities as a hit identification or lead molecule screening assay.31 With wt-MDM21­126, there is a ligand-dose-dependent increase in the thermal phase shift from 75 °C without ligand up to 85 °C at the highest concentration of Nutlin-3 (Fig. 4a­c). The second ligand-dependent unfolding transition induced at approximately 51 °C again does not show ligand dose dependency at these concentrations of Nutlin-3 (10­40 M) (Fig. 4a­c). This latter result is consistent with that acquired using the p53mimetic peptide (Fig. 3). With S17D-MDM21­126, there is a ligand-dosedependent increase in thermal phase shift from 77 °C without ligand to 86 °C with the highest Nutlin-3 concentration (Fig. 4a­c). The increase in the thermostability of S17D-MDM21­126 in the presence of ligand is consistent with data showing that phosphomimetic mutation induces a more stable complex between the full-length S17D-MDM2 and Nutlin-3.23 S17D-MDM21­126 also exhibited the second liganddependent thermal phase shift induced at approximately 50­53 °C that, similar to the wt counterpart, does not show Nutlin-3 dose dependency (Fig. 4a­c). As with the wt counterpart, this second liganddependent phase shift at 50­53 °C is not affected by the S17D mutation. In order to determine whether we could identify experimental conditions where the "two-phase" thermal unfolding transitions could be uncoupled, we evaluated MDM2 unfolding as a function of

temperature at relatively low (1 M) ligand concentrations (Fig. 5). Two notable events were observed. First, using peptide 12.1, we induced the two-phase thermal shift only in wt-MDM21­126 (Fig. 5a) under conditions where Tm (77 °C) was higher than that without ligand, but lower than that with 10 M ligand. This further highlights the ligand concentration effect on the unfolding transition. By contrast, with the use of Nutlin at this lowest concentration, there was an increased Tm of unfolding (Fig. 5b) compared to unliganded MDM2, but the  50­53 °C transition was absent. These data together demonstrate that the highest temperature transition is dependent on the ligand concentration, but that the modes of binding of Nutlin and peptide (via stabilizing effects) are distinct. Lastly, in order to evaluate the fundamental effects of the Lid itself on MDM2 N-terminal domain thermostability in the presence of ligand, we used the MDM21­126 mutant with Lid deletion (amino acids 1­24 removed; Lid-MDM225­126). This mutant has reduced thermostability compared to the MDM21­126 variants (Fig. 2). Increasing concentrations of the p53mimetic peptide 12.1 induced a dose-dependent increase in the Tm values of Lid-MDM2 25­126 (from 66 °C without ligand to 74 °C) (Fig. 6a­c). The lowered basal and peptide­ligand-induced changes in the mid-point melting temperature are consistent with a positive effect of the Lid on the stability of the MDM2 N-terminal domain. The evaluation of LidMDM225­126 unfolding transition as a function of increasing Nutlin-3 (Fig. 7a­c) similarly demonstrated ligand concentration dependence in the thermal transitions of Lid-MDM225­126 (from 66 °C without ligand to 79 °C). However, Lid-MDM225­126 exhibits a Tm lower than that of S17D or wt-MDM21­126, further consistent with the general stabilizing role of Lid on MDM2 conformation.

Conclusion
MDM2 is a multidomain E3 RING domain containing ubiquitin ligase. The ubiquitination reaction mechanism requires at least three functional MDM2 minidomains: the N-terminal hydrophobic pocket, the central acidic peptide-binding domain, and the C-terminal RING domain. This multidomain structure drives a "dual-site" docking of MDM26 to

at least two distinct peptide motifs on the p53 tetramer: the first in the transactivation domain of p53,32 and the second in the DNA-binding domain at a conformationally flexible motif that is commonly unfolded on mutant p53.6,7,33 This dual-site docking model was challenged by asking what effect the Nterminal pseudo-substrate or "lid" would have on dual-site docking (i.e., Would the data thus acquired be consistent with the dual-site docking by MDM2 or would the data drive a substantial modification or reworking of that model?). We observed that the phosphomimetic mutation "opened" the MDM2 structure as defined by the elevated stability of the MDM2­p53 tetramer complex and MDM2 binding to the DNA-binding domain,23 consistent with the dual-site docking model. The Lid deletion, by

contrast, increased the thermoinstability of the MDM2 domain. These data also appeared to contradict a model based on data obtained by NMR, which suggested that the phosphomimetic mutation should "close" the lid over the MDM2 pocket and preclude p53 binding.22 As the latter study used the N-terminal domain of MDM2 and the former study used full-length MDM2, we attempted to resolve this controversy by defining the effect of S17D mutation on MDM2 1­126 peptide binding activity: Would this mutation open or close the pocket? We utilized a quantitative assay (fluorescence thermal denaturation assay) that measures protein stability as a function of ligand binding. This real-time binding assay has the advantage in that protein­ligand stability can be measured without the

use of a solid phase and that indirect detection of the MDM2­ligand complex is not required (i.e., we do not require the use of a "tag" on the MDM2 protein or the use of an antibody targeted to the MDM2 protein, which might perturb MDM2 conformation).

Our data reveal the following conclusions (as in Table 1): (i) the isolated N-terminal domain of wt-MDM2, Lid-MDM225­126, and S17D-MDM2 exhibits one thermal phase shift; (ii) the isolated Nterminal domain of wt-MDM2, Lid-MDM225­126,

Mutation of the MDM2 Lid Stabilizes Ligand Binding

Fig. 8. MDM2 lid is in a dynamic equilibrium between an `open' state and a `closed' state. (1) The N-terminal domain of MDM2 (hydrophobic pocket; e.g., Hy) has a pseudo-substrate motif or "lid" that is in equilibrium in different conformations22,27,28 (arrows). (2) Phosphomimetic mutation (D; in red) stabilizes the Lid via an interaction with the MDM2 N-terminal domain, and this "opens" the hydrophobic pocket to stabilize p53 interactions. Our previous study developed a model invoking an interaction with the phosphomimetic Lid on the Nterminal domain of MDM2 using full-length untagged S17D-MDM2.23 Our current study demonstrates that the isolated MDM2 N-terminal domain can respond to the S17D Lid mutation (or Lid deletion) and indicates that other domains are not essential for this effect. However, we still cannot rule out the possibility that the Lid interacts with other regions on full-length MDM2. Nevertheless, the data (Figs. 2­7) support one possible model whereby mutation at serine 17 to the phosphomimetic aspartic acid drives the lid equilibrium to a site where D17 interacts stably with R97 and K98 (Fig. 1c), thus leading to MDM2 in an `open' conformation, making it more thermoresistant and favoring ligand binding. (3) The Lid can still regulate the MDM2­p53 ligand complex without phosphomimetic mutation (Figs. 6 and 7). Although phosphorylation of the Lid is not essential for MDM2 to interact with p53, it raises the specific activity of MDM2, and this might be physiologically relevant in vivo. Furthermore, deleting the lid on full-length MDM2 induces MDM2 protein instability in cells,23 and our current study indicates that Lid deletion in the isolated Nterminal domain similarly induces thermoinstability to MDM2. These data indicate that the Lid can function as a positive regulatory motif and that phosphorylation could further increase its positive role by elevating the specific activity of MDM2 as a p53 binding protein. These data suggest that Lid phosphorylation in cells would increase the interaction of MDM2 with p53. The effects of this Lid phosphorylation on MDM2 functions in vivo are not necessarily evident, since MDM2 can target p53 in a variety of positive and negative manners, including increased p53 protein translation,37 ubiquitination after X-irradiation to facilitate p53 stabilization,38 ubiquitination and degradation of p53 in undamaged cells,39 chaperoning and p53 protein folding,14,18 and p53 transcription suppression in the nucleus.9

and S17D-MDM2, in the presence of ligand, exhibits two ligand-dependent thermal transitions; and (iii) in the presence of ligand, the S17D mutation increases thermal stability by approximately 2 °C, and the Lid deletion decreases thermostability by 6­9 °C. These data also indicate that (i) phosphomimetic mutation increases, rather than decreases, the affinity of the isolated MDM2 domain for its ligand and is consistent with the model indicating that this type of mutation "opens" the MDM2 pocket (Fig. 1c);23 and (ii) the RING domain is not essential for the stimulatory effect of phosphomimetic mutation in the MDM2 lid on ligand binding. The data thus reveal that S17D lid mutation has an intrinsic ability to stabilize the isolated N-terminal domain of MDM2 (amino acids 1­126) in the absence or in the presence of ligand. This suggests that the phosphomimetic lid mutation "opens," rather than "closes," the pocket and also indicates that neither the RING domain nor the acidic domain plays an essential role in this process. However, given the striking effect of RING mutation on the stimulation of the N-terminal peptide binding activity of MDM2,29 we cannot rule out the possibility that the RING domain does interact allosterically with the N-terminal domain of S17D-MDM2 (full length) under physiological situations. Interestingly, a recent report that is relevant to our current results has highlighted the use of molecular dynamics simulations at high temperatures as an approach to evaluating helix­helix interactions that occur during ligand binding by MDM2. Due to constraints on the timeframe of simulations compared to real-time binding, the reverse reaction (i.e., unfolding of the N-terminal domain of MDM2) was modeled at high temperature in the absence and in the presence of ligand.34 The authors identified a potential two-stage unfolding of MDM2 in the absence or in the presence of ligand in the simulations; in our experimental work, we do see a twophase unfolding reaction, but only in the presence of ligand. However, the molecular simulations did uncover a difference between simulated unfolding in the absence of ligand and simulated unfolding in the presence of ligand. In the presence of ligand, the unfolding proceeded through the following stages: p53 unbinding, tertiary unfolding, and, lastly, secondary structure unfolding--helix III first and then helices I, II, and IV. In the absence of ligand, unfolding proceeded through a partial reversal: helix III unfolding, tertiary unfolding, and unfolding of helices I, II, and IV. Thus, if our experimental data were to complement theoretical data, we could predict that the two stages of unfolding in the presence of ligand are due to the independent stability of the tertiary structure and helices, whereas the first unfolding of helix III in apoMDM2 is rate limiting, resulting in rapid loss of structure. Furthermore, as the two-phase shift is dampened in the S17D-MDM2 mutant, this suggests that the lid shifts the MDM2 domain away from the two-phase stable unfolding transition to a singlephase transition. Regardless, molecular simulations

and experimental data now provide a complement to begin to develop mutagenesis approaches to defining how helix stability effects lid control over MDM2 function. Together, these data provide further evidence that modification of the relatively small peptide lid of MDM2 can regulate the thermostability, specific activity, and conformation of MDM2 protein (Fig. 8). This also underscores the growing realization that small intrinsically unstructured or disordered peptide binding motifs on proteins provide significant specificity for and information on regulating the specific activity and protein­ protein interaction properties of an enzyme.35

Materials and Methods
Protein purification and protein binding assays MDM2 minidomains were expressed as glutathione-Stransferase-tagged proteins using pGEX-6P1 and purified from soluble Escherichia coli lysates using glutathione beads (GE Healthcare). Cells were lysed with 10% sucrose, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM benzamidine, 150 mg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitors for 40 min on ice prior to sonication. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione beads for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation, followed by four washes with 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.1% NP40. Protein was cleaved off the column using Precision protease (GE Healthcare) into 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol. Recombinant human MDM2 protein and p53 protein binding assays were developed as described previously.23 Thermal protein-unfolding assay Extent of protein unfolding was measured using fluorescent SYPRO Orange dye31 (Invitrogen). Either wt, Lid, or S17D-MDM2 proteins were diluted to a final concentration of 10 M in buffer [20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol] in the presence or in the absence of increasing concentrations of ligand (10­40 M p53-mimetic peptide 12.136 or Nutlin-310 ) before the addition of SYPRO Orange. Samples were aliquoted onto a 96-well PCR plate and sealed with optical-quality sealing film (Bio-Rad). The rate of protein unfolding was measured using an iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad) by heating samples from 20 °C to 90 °C at 1 °C increments with a 30-s incubation at each increment. Fluorescence intensity was measured using excitation/emission wavelengths of 485 nm/575 nm in relative light units, and thermal denaturation graphs were plotted as a function of the gradient of protein unfolding against the temperature gradient [d(RFU)/dT].
