Abstract Objectives. To analyze expressions of the EphB2 and EphB4 receptors in ovarian carcinomas and explore their clinicopathological correlations and prognostic value. Methods. 115 patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma FIGO IIB to IV were involved. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to examine the expressions of EphB2/B4 receptor mRNA and protein. Correlations between protein expression and clinicopathological factors were also analyzed. Results. Ovarian carcinoma patients with age elder than 60 years had higher EphB2 expression than younger patients. Expression of EphB2 and EphB4 protein did not significantly correlate with any other clinical variables, including FIGO stage, residual tumor, histological type and differentiation grade. No significant correlation between mRNA and protein expression level for both of these receptors was seen. It was found that patients with strong immunostaining for EphB2 ( P = 0.03) or EphB4 ( P = 0.003) receptors had poorer survival, and patients with strong immunostaining for EphB4 receptor showed poorer response to chemotherapy ( P = 0.036). Conclusions. These studies suggest that EphB2 and B4 receptors are of prognostic value and EphB4 receptor may be an independent predictor of chemotherapy response in ovarian cancer patients.

Introduction Tyrosine kinases (TK) are enzymes catalyzing transfer of the g phosphate of ATP to the hydroxyl groups of tyrosines on signal transduction molecules [1]. More than 90 known TKs have been identified in human genome. Among these, 58 are of transmembrane receptor type and 32 of cytoplasmic non-receptor type [2]. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their ligands are implicated in processes like cell division cycle, cell migration, cell metabolism, and survival, as well as cell proliferation and differentiation. Current data reveal that they are overexpressed and functionally altered in malignant cells [3,4]. The Eph receptor family constitutes one of the largest RTK families [5], and all members share a similar structure including a ligand binding extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. 16 Eph

receptor members have been recorded in vertebrate species and are divided into two subfamilies: EphA (A1 ­A10) and EphB (B1 ­B6) receptors, based on different ligand binding. EphA is bound by ephrinA (A1 ­ A5), which is anchored to membrane by GPI, glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol. EphB is bound by ephrinB (B1 ­B3), which is anchored to the membrane by a transmembrane domain. The main characteristic of Eph receptors is the high promiscuity in interaction between receptors and ligands. Not only Eph receptors and ephrin ligands can bind with each other within the same class, but interactions between subclasses are also found. EphA4 can be bound and activated by ephrinAs as well as by ephrinB2 and B3 [6]. EphB2 can bind to ephrinA5 and be activated, forming heterodimer different from the tetrameric EphB2 ­ ephrin B2 structure [7]. Many Eph members in the same subclass have overlapping regions, and an overlapping with ligands is also seen. Furthermore, Eph members and their ligands are well-known for their two ways of signal transduction, forward and reverse signaling [8]. The activities of Eph receptors and their ligands are not only limited to the

Negative controls for EphB2 and EphB4 were done by substitution of the antibodies with corresponding non-immune IgG of the same concentration from the same source. In addition, negative control for EphB2 was also performed by EphB2 peptide (sc-1763p, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, CA, USA) blocking according to the manufacturer's recommendation. All controls gave satisfactory results.

nervous system, but they have widespread expression in different cell types and influence a diverse array of physiological functions ranging from cardiovascular development to immune regulation, early embryonic cell movements and tumorigenesis [9­ 11]. The incidence of invasive ovarian cancer in Scandinavia is among the highest in the world, and the age-adjusted rate in Norway in 2001 [12] was 13.4/105. The prognosis is unfavorable. Residual tumor after surgery, grade of differentiation, and clinical stage are important prognostic factors. Recently, Cyclooxygenase-2 [13], CD24 [14], P53, Bcl-2, and Bax [15,16] were all reported to be of prognostic significance in ovarian cancer patients. An association between histological grade and level of Eph expression has been reported for many tumor types [17 ­19]. The expression status of EphB receptors in ovarian cancer is not available in literature, although it has been reported that, in normal ovarian tissues, EphB1/B2/B4 and ephrinB1/B2 mRNA expressions are detected in human luteinizing granulosa cells in corpora lutea of the early luteal phase [20]. Most ovarian carcinomas are thought to arise from the transformation of ovarian epithelial cells. In this study, we aimed to examine the expression profiles of EphB2 and EphB4 receptors in ovarian cancer, the correlation to chemotherapy response, and the prognostic value of these factors in advanced ovarian carcinoma patients.
Materials and methods Patients and specimens
This study includes 115 patients with ovarian cancer stage FIGO IIB ­ IV. All patients had primary surgery performed at the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, The Norwegian Radium Hospital during the period of 1993 to 2000. After surgery, the patients received platinum-based chemotherapy. An informed consent was obtained from all the patients enrolled in this study. Clinical data and follow-up information were collected from the medical records. Pertinent clinical data are given in Table 1. The median age of the patients was 59.7 years (range 38 ­ 81). All patients were followed until death or December 1, 2004. Median follow-up time for patients still alive was 71 months (range 26 ­ 128 months). Surgically removed material was divided into two parts. One was formalinfixed and paraffin-embedded for histological evaluation and immunohistochemistry, and another was frozen at À70-C in a freezer for later RNA isolation.

Laser captured microdissection (LCM)
In total, 28 frozen tumor tissue specimens were chosen for LCM and RNA isolation. From these tumors, two frozen sections were made, one was 5 Am and another was 8 Am. The 5 Am was fixed in formalin, stained with hematoxylin ­ eosin (HE), and used for morphological orientation. Pure tumor cells without lymphocytes and stromal cells were chosen. The HE-stained sections served as guidance for LCM. LCM was done by using a PixCell laser capture microscope (Arcturus Engineering Inc., Mountain View, CA). The 8 Am section was first fixed with acetone for 5 min, stained with HE, dehydrated in graded alcohol, and xylene, and then air-dried for 5 min. The LCM parameters were as follows: a laser power of 70 mW, laser pulse duration of 1.2 ­ 3.5 ms, and laser spot size of 7.5 ­ 15 Am diameter. The infrared laser was pulsed over the selected cells, and the cells were captured by focal melting of the membrane through laser activation. The number of tumor cells obtained ranged from 50 to 200.

RNA isolation and RT-PCR
RNA from the 28 LCM specimens was extracted using an Absolutely RNAi Nanoprep Kit (Stratagene Inc. La Jolla, USA) following the manual. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was done by Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, USA). The total reaction volume was 25 Al. The reaction system was as follows: 5 Al 5Â Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR buffer, 5 Al 5Â Q solution, 200 AM dNTP, 0.6 AM of each forward and reverse primer of target gene, 0.2 AM forward and reverse GAPD primer, 2 Al RNA, and 1 Al Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR enzyme mix. The reaction condition was: 50-C for 30 min for reverse transcription of RNA followed by 95-C for 15 min for cDNA denaturation and then 35 cycles at 94-C for 60 s, 60-C for 30 s, and 72-C for 1 min. A final extension was performed at 72-C for 10 min. The primer pair sequences are given in Table 2. The results were evaluated by comparison of the intensity of the target band and the GAPD band. GAPD primers were used in each reaction to control an Table 1 EphB2 and EphB4 immunostaining in relation to clinicopathological parameters in 115 patients with advanced ovarian cancer EphB2 staining scores Total 1 Age group 60 years >60 years FIGO stage IIB ­ IIIB IIIC IV Residual tumor None Any Histological type Serous Non-serous Grade of differentiation G1 G2 G3 58 57 8 70 37 20 95 94 21 7 28 80 2 3 P EphB4 staining scores Total 0 1 2 3 P 13 23 16 6 0.13 10 22 10 15 1 4 2 1 0.94 14 29 14 13 8 12 10 7 4 8 4 4 0.99 19 37 22 17 20 37 18 19 0.24 3 8 8 2 2 3 2 0 0.311 4 16 4 4 17 26 20 17

Immunohistochemistry
Slides for immunohistochemistry were stained using the Dako EnVisioini+ System, Peroxidase (DAB) (K4007 and K4011, Dako Corporation, CA, USA) and Dakoautostainer. Deparaffinized sections were microwaved in 10 mM citrate buffer pH 6.0 to unmask the epitopes. After incubation with 0.03% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min to block the endogenous peroxidase activity, the slides were washed with TBS (from DakoCytomation) and incubated with primary antibodies, goat polyclonal antibody EphB2, and rabbit polyclonal antibody EphB4 (sc-1763, sc-5536, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, CA, USA) for 30 min at room temperature. For EphB2, slides were incubated with mouse anti-goat IgG diluted 1:100 for 30 min and then incubated with peroxidase-labeled polymer conjugated to goat anti-mouse for 30 min. For EphB4, the slides were incubated with peroxidase-labeled polymer conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted to 1:100 for 30 min. Slides were stained for 10 min with 3,3V-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and then counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted in Diatex.

If the target band was of an intensive illumination, it was scored as ``+++''. ``++'' was given if the illumination intensity of the target band was between ``+'' and ``+++''.

Results Immunohistochemistry Positive EphB2 staining was detected in all 115 carcinomas. Among these, 22 (19%) showed weak, 50 (44%) moderate and 43 (37%) strong immunoreactivity (Fig. 1A). A homogenous cytoplasmic staining was observed in both carcinoma and endothelial cells. For EphB4 immunostaining, 23 carcinomas (20%) were negative, while 92 tumors (80%) demonstrated positive EphB4 immunostaining. Among the tumors with positive staining, 45 (49%) were weakly stained, 26 (28%) moderately and 21 (23%) strongly (Fig. 1B). The tumor cells immunoreactivity in the invasive front was stronger than in the center of the tumor areas. All staining immunoreactivity was in the cytoplasm. Some stromal cells were also immunoreactive. No association was found between the immunostaining patterns of the two Eph receptors (Table 3). mRNA expression To determine whether mRNA levels of EphB2/B4 corresponded with protein levels, 28 cases of frozen tissues were used (Figs. 2A and B). From each slide, 50­ 200 tumor cells were obtained by LCM. For EphB2, 6 out of 12 cases with low RNA expression had weak staining of EphB2 protein, 2/5 and 3/5 cases with moderate RNA expression had moderate and high protein expression, and 6/11 and 4/11 cases with strong RNA expression had moderate and high protein expression respectively. It seemed that there was a correlation between RNA and protein expression levels of EphB2, but no statistically significant difference was found. Also no significant difference was found for EphB4 receptor. Clinicopathological correlations Patients older than 60 years had higher EphB2 expression than younger patients ( P = 0.005). No significant correlation

Statistic analysis
SPSS12.0 was used for the statistical analysis. Differences in frequency among groups were evaluated by the Chi-square test. Overall survival was calculated from the date of surgery until the date of death or December 1, 2004 and subjected to Kaplan ­ Meier method. The log-rank test with a test for trend in the case of ordered variables was used for univariate analysis, and a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for multivariate analysis of survival. P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

protein was significantly associated with shortened overall survival ( P = 0.01), while strong staining of EphB2 did not obtain significance ( P = 0.07). Patients with primary tumor strongly positive for both EphB4 and EphB2 protein had poorer clinical outcome ( P = 0.008). Discussion Among gynecological cancers, ovarian carcinoma has the most unfavorable prognosis due to its insidious onset, diagnosis at late stage, and tendency to develop chemotherapy resistance. Ovarian carcinoma is responsible for half of the deaths caused by malignant tumors in the female genital tract. The 5-year relative survival rate in Norway is 41.7% [12]. EphB expression has been reported in various cancers, including carcinomas of the colon, lung, neuroblastoma, and oesteosarcoma [22 ­25]. Nakada et al. [26] reported that, in five glioma cell lines, actively migrating glioma cells had increased expression and phosphorylation of EphB2, and laser capture microdissected glioblastoma cells from tumor tissue showed high expression in both RNA and protein levels. Eph receptors play important roles in tumor development, probably by promoting tumor cell invasion and stimulating angiogenesis [27,28]. Eph receptors and their ligands have been reported to have diagnostic and prognostic value in tumors. Many findings implicate EphA2 as a powerful oncogene in metastatic cancer [29]. Higher levels of EphA2 together with moderate to high level of EphrinA-1 protein expressions in cervical squamous carcinomas have been reported to be predictive for a shorter overall survival [30]. EphA2 overexpression also correlates with poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [18]. The ligand of EphA2, Ephrin-A1 protein, has been related to decreased survival in melanoma patients [31]. Increased EphB2 protein expression is negatively associated with overall survival in breast cancer patients [32]. The significant reduction of EphB6 expression is associated with melanoma progression to metastatic disease [33]. EphrinB ligands may be poor prognostic markers in osteosarcomas [25] and gliomas [24]. In our present study of 115 cases of advanced ovarian carcinomas, 94 were of serous type. Patients with no residual disease after surgery had a considerably better prognosis than patients with residual tumor after surgery. Patients having first

was found between the expression of EphB2 or EphB4 and FIGO stage, residual tumor, histological type and grade of differentiation (data not shown). IHC and response to chemotherapy Response to primary chemotherapy was evaluable in 72 patients (Table 4). Out of patients with negative to moderate expression of EphB2, 21/45 (46.7%) patients obtained complete response, compared to 9/27 (33.3%) patients with strong EphB2 expression ( P = 0.57). Out of patients with negative to moderate expression of EphB4, 28/55 (50.9%) obtained complete response compared to 2/17 (11.8%) with strong EphB4 expression ( P = 0.036). Survival analysis In univariate analysis of survival, strong immunostaining for EphB2 and EphB4 was significantly associated with a poorer prognosis (Fig. 3A, P = 0.03; Fig. 3B, P = 0.003). A combined variable of immunostaining of the two variables showed the best survival for patients with tumors with negative ­ moderate staining for both receptors and the most unfavorable survival for patients with strong staining for both receptors ( P = 0.001) (Fig. 3C). Patients with no residual disease after surgery had a considerably better prognosis than patients with residual tumor ( P < 0.05). Patients having first line chemotherapy with a platinum compound plus paclitaxel had a considerably better survival than patients treated with either platinum alone or the platinum-based regimen without paclitaxel ( P < 0.05). In Cox multivariate analysis with overall survival as end point, FIGO stage, age group, residual tumor after surgery, grade of differentiation, histological type, and type of chemotherapy were included. Residual tumor and type of chemotherapy were the only clinicopathologic variables obtaining statistical significance. Strong staining for EphB4

line chemotherapy with a combination of a platinum and paclitaxel had a considerably better survival than patients treated with either platinum alone or platinum-based regimen without paclitaxel. This is in line with previous reports [34,35]. In this study, high levels of EphB2 and EphB4 protein expression were shown to be associated with a poorer prognosis in ovarian cancer patients in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, high levels of EphB4 protein expression were also significantly associated with poorer survival, but EphB2 did not. However, the most unfavorable prognosis was seen in patients with tumors strongly immunopositive for both receptors, indicating that both EphB2 and EphB4 are negative survival factors for ovarian carcinomas. Chemotherapy resistance is a common feature of ovarian cancers. In the present study, we found that strong immunostaining for EphB4 but not B2 indicated a poorer response to chemotherapy. Eph receptors take effects through interaction with their ligands, and the precise signaling mechanisms are complex and not fully understood yet. They may interact with a variety of intracellular targets and potentially induce distinct responses in different cell types. Many downstream proteins are reported to interact with Eph receptors, such as p59fyn, PI3-kinase, Grb2, Grb10, RasGap, Nck, Crk, Src-like protein, SLAP, AF6, the low-molecular weight phosphotyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP), and the docking protein p62dok [36 ­ 40]. Among these cascade proteins, P21-Ras protein is pivotal in the propagation of the signal originated from many RTKs. Ras is reported to be important in mediating resistance to radiotherapy [41,42]. Messina et al. [43] also demonstrated that targeting the Ras signaling pathway resulted in an enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapy of human glioblastoma patients. Therefore, studies of signal transduction between EphB4 and Ras in ovarian epithelial tumors are required. Two important issues should be concerned in interpreting the present results. Although we found that higher levels of EphB2/ EphB4 protein expression in the ovarian tumors were correlated with poorer survival and higher levels of EphB4 protein expression were significantly associated with chemotherapy resistance, their protein expressions were not associated with the classical clinical factors like histological grade and clinical stage. This discrepancy might be due to a bias introduced by the limited number of cases in our present study since we had only 115 patients. Therefore, it merits further study with larger series of materials. Another one is the disagreement between the immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR results of the clinical samples. Before we applied these methods to these samples, we tested them in the ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR3 and SKOV3 in our laboratory as well to evaluate the reliability of the immunohistochemistry method. The RNA levels detected with

between immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR in the clinical specimens might be due to the following factors: the laser microdissected cells were not completely representative for the whole slide because these two receptors were not always evenly expressed in the tissue; different post-transcriptional level regulations may exist in the clinical samples than that in the cultured ovarian cancer cells since tumor cells in the surgical specimens are located in a more complex environment. In a recently published article, Batlle et al. reported that EphB2 and EphB4 might be tumor suppressors in colon cancer [44]. In addition, mutationally inactivated EphB2 has been indicated as tumor suppressor in the prostate cancers [45]. We do not know the phosphorylation status of the EphB2 and EphB4 proteins in the highly expressed ovarian tumors in our series. It cannot be excluded that the overexpressed EphB2 and EphB4 proteins in the tumors were largely not phosphorylated, therefore, they were inactivated as well. It could be easily understood if this is the truth. Eph receptors have been found to have therapeutic effect in tumor treatment. Mao et al. [46] conjugated a monoclonal antibody 2H9 against extracellular sequence of EphB2 to monomethylauristatin E through a cathepsin B cleavable linker. This conjugate specifically killed EphB2 expressing cancer cells of colorectal cancer cell line and in human colon tumor implant model. In pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, knocking down EphA2 expression transiently causes suppression of cellular invasiveness, anoikis resistance, and substantially reduced tumor growth and metastasis [47]. Antibody targeting of the EphA2 inhibits mammary cellular behavior, such as the soft agar colonization [48]. A combined action of the Eph receptors/ligands may significantly influence the clinical ­ biological behavior of the given tumor. Therefore, manipulating single Eph receptor may be not enough for clinical application. In summary, we have shown that the ovarian epithelial carcinoma patients with tumors strongly positive for EphB2 and EphB4 receptors have an unfavorable overall survival, and patients with strong EphB4 receptor immunostained tumor have poorer response to chemotherapy, suggesting that EphB2 and EphB4 may have a role as prognostic factors in epithelial ovarian cancer patients and EphB4 may be a negative predictor for chemotherapy response.
