A novel series of aminopyridine N-oxides were designed, synthesized, and tested for their ability to inhibit p38R MAP kinase. Some of these compounds showed a significant reduction in the LPS-induced TNFR production in human whole blood. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed that N-oxide oxygen was essential for activity and was probably a determinant factor for a marked selectivity against other related kinases. Compound 45 was identified as a potent and selective p38R inhibitor with an appropriate balance between potency and pharmacokinetics. In vivo efficacy of 45 was demonstrated in reducing TNFR levels in an acute murine model of inflammation (ED50 = 1 mg/kg in LPS-induced TNFR production when dosed orally 1.5 h prior to LPS administration). The oral efficacy of 45 was further demonstrated in a chronic model of adjuvant arthritis in rats with established disease when administered orally (ED50 = 4.5 mg/kg).

Introduction The p38R mitogen activated protein (MAP ) kinase is an intracellular serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase that is activated by a range of environmental stimuli such as TNFR, IL-1, and stress.1,2 Activation of p38R occurs through bisphosphorylation by the dual-specificity Ser/Thr MAP kinases MKK3 and MKK6 on the Thr180-Gly181-Tyr182 motif located on the activation loop.2,3 In its activated state, p38R phosphorylates a range of intracellular protein substrates that post-transcriptionally regulate the biosynthesis of TNFR and IL-1. The pathophysiological consequence of excessive production of TNFR and IL-1 is thought to be significant mediation of the progression of many inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease.4-7 The proven ability of p38R MAP kinase to efficiently regulate both the release and the activity of those pro-inflamatory cytokines has attracted numerous pharmaceutical companies and independent

researchers into pursuing p38R inhibitors primarily as novel anti-inflammatory drugs.8 Since the first report in 1994 of the pyridylimidazole-based p38R inhibitor SB203580 (Figure 1),9 several compounds have advanced into clinical trials and some of them have dropped out due to various reasons.10,11 Candidates from Vertex (VX745, Figure 1),12,13 Boehringer Ingelheim (BIRB-796),14,15 Pfizer (SD-006),16 Amgen (AMG-548),17,18 and Scios (SCIO469)19,20 have maintained, or in some cases improved, potency and/or minimized liabilities that were identified in the original pyridylimidazole series. VX-745 was one of the first orally bioavailable discovered compounds that progressed to phase IIb clinical trials. This inhibitor was shown to have anti-inflammatory activity in rodent models and established proof-of-principle in RA patients21 before being discontinued due to issues associated with adverse neurological effects in animal models.22 The prototypical p38R inhibitor SB203580 contained a 4-aryl 5-(4-pyridinyl) motif and was found to interact competitively with the p38R ATP binding site. An example of the binding orientation is shown in Figure 2, where key interactions of this inhibitor with the active site of the enzyme are depicted. Two key interactions with the hinge region connecting the N- and C- terminal lobes of the kinase domain are observed with this compound, as well as with most known23 p38R inhibitors: a hydrogen bond through the pyridyl nitrogen to the backbone amide NH of Met109 and a significant lipophilic interaction of the inhibitor with the deep hydrophobic pocket I. This pocket I (also called the "selectivity pocket") displayed in our proposed binding model (Figure 2) is a region not occupied by the ATP when bound to the kinase. It is known24 that the binding of an aryl group into this pocket imparts selectivity for p38 against other related kinases.

Many of the early compounds presented a diaryl heterocyclic scaffold and have been shown to bind to the p38R active site in an orientation similar to SB203580.25-28 Of the nonvicinal diaryl scaffolds, Merck inhibitor 1 (Figure 3) has been shown to be a potent and very selective inhibitor. This p38R MAP kinase inhibitor displayed potent activity (p38R IC50 = 0.74 nM) and selectivity for p38R over a variety of other closely related kinases, including ERK1 and JNK1-3 (>10000 fold).29 The exquisite selectivity of Merck's compound could be based on an optimum interaction with the hydrophobic pocket I as well as on the ability of the carbonyl oxygen of this ligand to establish two key hydrogen bond contacts with both the backbone amide NH of Met109 and the NH of Gly110, inducing a conformational change in the hinge region of the enzyme, as depicted in Figure 4a. This disposition can be clearly confirmed in the X-ray crystallographic studies carried out with 1 in the active site of p38R.29 Although many kinases show a high degree of analogy at their catalytic sites, this conformational flexibility is an almost exclusive feature of p38R and p38 due to the presence of the small Gly110. Other related kinases contain bulkier residues on this position, which makes the conformational change virtually impossible.29 As part of our strategy to identify novel, potent, and selective p38R MAP kinase inhibitors, we focused our interest in the unprecedented level of selectivity exhibited in 1. This compound is derived from a dihydroquinolinone core30,31 and is characterized by the presence of two pendant aromatic rings that are critical for the enzymatic potency. The combined finetuned occupation of the hydrophobic pocket I with the already mentioned conformational change (peptide flip of the Gly110) approach provides a great opportunity to design novel and selective p38R inhibitors, which should interact within the catalytic site in a unique way. With the aim of identifying a potent and selective p38R inhibitor based on a simple core which displays a binding mode similar to 1, we focused on published Bayer pyridinones A (Figure 5). This original structure had been claimed by Bayer scientists as p38 MAP kinase inhibitors for the treatment of different inflammatory conditions (in particular asthma and COPD), showing enzymatic inhibition values in the submicromolar range.32,33 On the basis of this core, we proposed an isosteric change, using a novel aminopyridine N-oxide scaffold B as a suitable alternative for the development

of potential new p38R inhibitors (Figure 5). A plausible intramolecular hydrogen bond between the carbonyl's oxygen and the amino group would arrange a pseudobicyclic scaffold and place the rest of substituents in a suitable conformation within the active site of the enzyme. As depicted in Figure 4b, the N-oxide oxygen would be located in an appropriate disposition to simultaneously interact with the backbone amide NH of Met109 and the NH of Gly110 within the hinge region, resulting in the described conformational change (peptide flip of the Gly110) to reach good potency and an improved selectivity profile, while the pendant aromatic rings are assumed to make essential interactions with the enzyme by occupying the two key hydrophobic regions. Chemistry Aminopyridine N-oxides 34-61 were prepared following the synthetic route depicted in Scheme 1. Starting from N-(pyridin-3-yl)pivalamide 2,34 an ortho-directed lithiation at the 4-position of the pyridine followed by subsequent addition of the corresponding aldehydes gave carbinols 3a-e. Benzylic oxidation with MnO2 followed by the removal of pivaloyl group in acidic media afforded ketones 4a-e, which were converted into their corresponding N-oxides 5a-e via a smooth oxidation with mCPBA. Treatment of the latter with POBr3 furnished, in a regioselective way, key bromopyridines 6a-e, which were reacted with the appropriate boronic acids or esters (method A) under standard palladiummediated coupling conditions35,36 to afford compounds 7-33. For the preparation of 20 and 22, the arylation of bromopyridine 6e with sterically hindered phenylboronic acids was achieved in good to acceptable yields by using a mixture of S-Phos and Pd2(dba)3 in toluene37 (method B). In the case of 21 and 28, the introduction of the o,o-difluorophenyl rings was successfully carried out by taking advantage of a Negishi38,39 coupling reaction between 6e and the corresponding in situ formed o,o-difluorophenyl zinc derivatives (method C). Subsequent mCPBA oxidation at the pyridine nitrogen cleanly provided N-oxides 34-61. Alternatively, compounds 58 and 59 were synthesized in an additional step by standard alkylation or amide formation reactions, respectively, following the N-oxidation reaction (Scheme 2) in order to avoid interferences with other basic nitrogen atoms present in the molecule. Results and Discussion On the basis of our initial design of a simple aminopyridine template B (Figure 5), non-N-oxide compound 7 (precursor of 34) was tested for its ability to inhibit in vitro the p38R MAP

kinase. Some enzymatic inhibition was seen (p38R IC50 = 2.2 M) and revealed 7 as an initial hit for further optimization. To our delight, we could observe that the presence of an oxygen attached to the nitrogen of the pyridine core (aminopyridine N-oxide analogue 34, Table 1), which would be responsible for the postulated interactions with the hinge region, afforded a reasonable inhibitory potency in the enzymatic (p38R IC50 = 0.967 M) and in the cellular (LPSinduced TNFR release in THP-1 cells, IC50=1.63 M) assays. To our knowledge, this was the first example of a highly

decorated 3-aminopyridine N-oxide scaffold to be identified as an inhibitor of p38R MAP kinase. Preliminary SAR studies were developed in this series in order to further explore its full potential. Our binding model of B proposes a fit of the phenyl ring located into the hydrophobic pocket II (Figure 4b), a relatively open solvent exposed area. As demonstrated in Table 1, compounds 35 and 36, possessing ortho substituted phenyl rings in R2, were markedly more potent than their unsubstituted analogue 34. The role of this substituent seems to be the maintenance of the ring in an appropriate (orthogonal) orientation with respect to the aminopyridine core, increasing the lipophilic interactions with the hydrophobic pocket II. The postulated binding model is consistent with the observed SAR. Substitution at the para position of the aryl ring by lipophilic groups with no substitution at the ortho positions, as in 37, did not improve the enzymatic inhibition (p38R IC50 = 2.53 M). The postulated binding model (Figure 4b) suggests that not very large substituents would be tolerated in the para position of the phenyl group in R1 due to its proximity toward the hinge region.40 In contrast, relatively bulky substituents would be allowed in the ortho position. To investigate the effect of substitution on this group, a small number of compounds (38-41) were synthesized, keeping the 2-Clphenyl substitution pattern in R2, and their potency in the enzymatic assay measured (Table 2). As postulated above, a chlorine atom in the ortho position (38) was well tolerated and significantly increased the p38 inhibitory potency (7-fold) with respect to the R1 unsubstituted lead 35. This substituent also afforded a substantial improvement (5-fold) with respect to 35 in the LPS-induced TNFR production assay in human whole blood (HWB). We put particular emphasis on this assay as a key driver for compound selection41 because it provided surrogate efficacy in a physiologically relevant environment in the presence of serum albumin and other proteins. As the size of the ortho substituents on R1 notably increased, there was a remarkable loss in potency (enzymatic and cellular), as can be seen in compounds 39 and 40, suggesting that this deep hydrophobic pocket is very sensitive to accommodate larger substitutions on this ring.40 More interestingly, compound 41, which combines two fluorine substituents in the ortho and para positions, as in Merck

inhibitor 1, exhibited good potency in both the enzymatic (p38R IC50 = 39 nM) and cellular assays (TNFR in HWB IC50 =79 nM). After this preliminary exploration, the 2,4-difluorophenyl ring was considered as an optimum R1 substitution pattern. Taking this into consideration, a thorough analysis of the SAR around the R2 moiety was thus carried out with the aim of finding suitable substituents that would optimally fit the hydrophobic pocket II, providing more potent analogues. As we have previously mentioned, ortho substitution on the R2 aryl group is preferred over para and meta, as can be seen in compounds 41-43 (Tables 2 and 3). The introduction of bulkier groups in the ortho position resulted in a loss in potency (analogue 46). Interestingly, the ortho substitution by an electron-donating group, as in derivative 44, gave a very potent compound in the enzymatic assay (IC50 = 23 nM) but there was a clear shift in the cellular assay (TNFR in HWB IC50 = 291 nM). However, 2-methyl analogue 45 displayed good potency in both assays (p38R IC50 = 21 nM and TNFR in HWB IC50 = 170 nM). We have already assessed that the increased activity of these analogues is in agreement with the fact that a substituent in ortho forces the orthogonality of the rings, optimizing the lipophilic interactions with the hydrophobic pocket II.42-44 Following this premise, a series of 2,6disubstituted phenyl analogues in R2 were synthesized in order to maximize the lipophilic interactions in this region. Gratifyingly, we could observe that 2,6-dichlorophenyl analogue 47 exhibited and excellent in vitro enzymatic potency (p38R IC50 = 9 nM), 4-fold more potent than its monosubstituted analogue 41. Surprisingly, this compound suffered from a considerable drop in potency in the cellular HWB assay (77-fold loss). The presence of the smaller fluorine atoms in 48 afforded the most potent compound of this series tested in the cell-based assays (TNFR in HWB IC50 = 37 nM) showing also a very good enzymatic activity (p38R IC50 = 17 nM). 2,6-Dimethylphenyl analogue 49 revealed a similar trend to 48, with excellent values in all assays. In a comparable manner to 44, electron-donating groups on the ring in 50 give nice enzymatic values but fail again in the HWB assay (41-fold drop). In general, the 2,6-disubstituted derivatives showed an increase in the enzymatic potency with respect to their monosubstituted analogues.

Carrying out a variation at the phenyl substitution pattern, it was seen that both the 2,3-disubstituted analogues 51 and 52 were potent against p38R activity but again showed a significant shift in the cellular HWB assay. The 2,4-disubstitution pattern on the phenyl R2 ring offered a new approach to interact with the hydrophobic pocket II. 2,4-Difluorophenyl compound 53 displayed modest potency compared to its 2,6-difluorophenyl analogue 48 (7-fold drop in both assays). A combination of methyl and chlorine in 54 gave a better p38 inhibitory potency (IC50 = 38 nM), but it was still far from the 2,6-disubstituted derivatives. Interestingly, the 2,4,6-trisubstituted compound 55 significantly increased the enzymatic inhibitory activity, leading to the most potent molecule found in the series (p38R IC50 = 5 nM); unfortunately, its lack of potency in the HWB cellular assay (40-fold loss with respect to 48) meant that this compound was not characterized further. Among all of the compounds synthesized up to this point, analogues 41, 45, 48, and 49 displayed the best p38R inhibitory and cellular (THP-1 and HWB) potency values. However, these molecules exhibited rather limited solubility (Table 4, entries 1-4), increasing the risk of a poor oral bioavailability.45 For this reason, our next strategy focused on the

improvement of this physicochemical property, installing either polar or ionizable functional groups directly or indirectly attached (via an appropriate linker) to the para position of the R2 aryl ring, pointing out toward the solvent exposed area (Table 5). The presence of a hydroxyl group in 56 slightly improved the enzymatic potency (2.6-fold compared to 45), but there was a big drop in the cellular assays, particularly in

HWB (IC50 = 7 ) and, to our surprise, displayed poorer solubility values than its precursor 45 (Table 4, entry 5). When a carboxylic acid was installed in this position (57), the potency clearly decreased (24-fold loss in p38R with respect to 45), although its solubility at neutral and basic pH dramatically increased (Table 4, entry 6). The insertion of a residue containing a basic group (compounds 58 and 59), as expected, led to a dramatic improvement in solubility at acidic pH (Table 4, entry 7). Unfortunately, although 58 and 59 retained or slightly improved the enzymatic activity, a tremendous drop in the cellular assay potency was observed. On the basis of these results, the introduction of nonbasic solubilizing polar substituents was considered. Unfortunately, solubility was not increased (Table 4, entries 8 and 9) and the synthesized derivatives 60 and 61 did not demonstrate noticeable advantages with respect to their basic counterparts 58 and 59. At this

point, we could speculate that the tremendous drop between the enzymatic and HWB assays in 56-61 could be related to the increased polarity of the compounds, although we were not able to find a common trend to all the compounds of the series. Despite the efforts to increase the solubility, compounds 41 and 45 still displayed a useful compromise between desirable physical properties (solubility) and potency in both enzymatic and cellular (HWB) assays and were selected as suitable leads for further characterization. The pharmacokinetic parameters of compounds 41 and 45 in rat are summarized in Table 6. Compound 41 was slowly absorbed (tmax = 3.5 h), showing very good oral exposure (AUC0-6). The low values of clearance (Cl) and volume of distribution in the steady state (Vss) translated into a very long terminal half-life (t1/2 = 14.8 h). Moreover, this compound

exhibited a modest bioavailability (F = 23%). On the other hand, compound 45, with a more rapid absorption (tmax =0.75 h) and still good oral exposure, displayed moderate clearance and low volume of distribution in the steady state, affording a shorter half-life (t1/2 =1.6 h). Additionally, analogue 45 exhibited a 3-fold increase in rat oral bioavailability (F = 75%), which led to its selection as an advanced lead for additional profiling. To confirm the proposed binding mode for our aminopyridine N-oxide scaffold B (Figure 5), compound 45 was cocrystallized with unphosphorylated p38R.46 Pleasantly, the X-ray structure (Figure 6) revealed a novel binding mode according to that previously proposed in Figure 4b and was consistent with the structure activity relationships (SAR) generated. Of particular interest were the two hydrogen bond interactions generated between the N-oxide oxygen, the backbone amide NH of Met109, and the NH of Gly110, resulting in the described conformational change ("Gly flip"). Overlying X-ray crystal structures of 4546 with that of Merck inhibitor 1 (Figure 6)28 clearly confirmed the similarities of the key hydrogen bond interactions of both compounds with the hinge region of the enzyme. More interestingly, the suggested pseudobicyclic scaffold of B was nicely established in the crystal structure of 45, with the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen and the amino group, placing the pending aryl rings in a similar conformation to those of 1 within the p38R active site. The selectivity of 45 was assessed by the screening of this compound against a panel of 21 tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases.47 Impressively, 45 was found to be highly selective for p38R/ over all tested kinases (e.g., c-Raf, JNK1-3, MK2, IC50 > 10 M). Its ability to inhibit different cytochrome P450 isoforms was also evaluated. Compound 45 did not inhibit any of the most relevant P450 isoforms (1A2, 3A4, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6) at a concentration of 10 M. Compound 45 was tested for in vitro cytotoxicity against a Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell line, showing a clean cytotoxic profile (IC50 > 200 M). In relation to the cardiovascular safety package, analogue 45 did not have a significant effect on the inhibition of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel (4.7% at 3 M) expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells. In Vivo Pharmacological Evaluation. Key compounds were tested in vivo in an acute model based on rat-LPS induced TNFR (Table 7). In this model, compounds were dosed orally one hour prior to LPS administration and the amount of TNFR in plasma was measured 1.5 h later (coinciding with the peak of TNFR production). Compound 34 dose-dependently inhibited TNFR production with and ED50 similar to that obtained for BIRB-796 reference compound. In contrast, compound 45 was much more potent at inhibiting TNFR production in this model with an ED50 of 1.03 mg/kg (95% CI, 0.5-2). These results are in accordance with those obtained in enzymatic and cellular assays for both compounds. The adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) model was selected as a chronic disease model to evaluate compound efficacy (Table 7). Upon arthritis induction, compounds were administered orally once daily for 7 days. Compound 34 dosed at 10 mg/kg produced a slight inhibition (17%) of the contralateral paw volumes (versus vehicle-treated animals). In contrast, 45 dose-dependently inhibited arthritis progression with an ED50 of 4.5 mg/kg (95% CI, 2-11). These results demonstrate a superior efficacy of 45 versus other clinically

tested reference compounds like BIRB-796 and VX-745 when dosed in the same manner (Figure 7 and Table 7). Conclusions The initial hypothesis of inducing a conformational change in the hinge region of p38R to develop inhibitors with an improved selectivity profile against other kinases has generated a variety of selective inhibitors based on a novel aminopyridine N-oxide scaffold. After an extensive SAR exercise, compounds 41 and 45 were identified as potent p38R inhibitors and were able to effectively inhibit the production of TNFR in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells as well as in human whole blood. The proposed binding mode for this novel series of inhibitors is consistent with the crystallography results obtained from inhibitor 45 within the p38R active site. This compound displayed an excellent selectivity for p38R/ versus a panel of 21 related kinases as well as good pharmacokinetic properties in Wistar rats. In vivo pharmacological data for 45 confirms that this compound is orally bioavailable and is active both in acute and chronic inflammation models, clearly reflecting the contribution of its potent cellular activity and the plasma levels attained.

The mixture was submitted to three vacuum-argon cycles, and then [1,10 -bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II) complex with dichloromethane (1:1) (0.035 mmol) was added and the mixture purged in the same way. The reaction was stirred at 80 °C under argon for 17 h. Subsequently, water was added to the cold reaction mixture and it was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 Â 50 mL), the organic solution was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica flash, using a mixture of hexanes and ethyl acetate as eluent, to yield the compounds 7-19, 24-27, 29, and 30. Method B. In a Schlenk tube were charged the compounds 6a-e (0.50 mmol), the corresponding boronic acids (1.00 mmol), potassium carbonate (1.50 mmol), and toluene (4 mL). The mixture was submitted to three vacuum-argon cycles, and then S-PHOS (0.030 mmol) and tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (0.015 mmol) were added and the mixture purged in the same way.

Subsequently, water was added to the cold reaction mixture and it was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 Â 50 mL), the organic solution was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica flash, using a mixture of hexanes and ethyl acetate as eluent to afford compounds 20, 22, and 23. Method C. n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 1.20 mmol) was dropwise added to a solution of the corresponding benzene derivative (1.30 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (2 mL) at -78 °C under argon, and the resulting mixture was stirred at that temperature for 30 min. Then, the reaction mixture was warmed up to -50 °C and ZnCl2 (0.5 M in THF, 1.30 mmol) carefully added. After 20 min, the corresponding compound 6a-e (0.65 mmol, in 1.5 mL of THF) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (0.061 mmol) were sequentially added. The mixture was then submitted to three vacuum-argon cycles and warmed, first to room temperature for 15 min and then to 40 °C for 48 h. After this time, the reaction was cooled down and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude was purified by column chromatography on silica flash using a mixture of hexanes and ethyl acetate as eluent to yield the compounds 21 and 28.

Biological Methods. p38r Kinase Inhibition Assay. Enzymatic activity assay was performed in 96-well microtiter plates (Corning, catalogue no. 3686) using a total volume of 50 L of an assay buffer composed of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1.75 mM Na3VO4. Various concentrations of the test compound or vehicle controls were preincubated for one hour with 0.055 g/mL of the human p38R (SAPKa) enzyme (obtained from University of Dundee). The reaction started by addition of biotinylated ATF2 substrate and ATP in concentrations around their Km values (final concentration 0.62 and 60 M, respectively) and took place for one hour at 25 °C. Addition of the detection reagents, streptavidin-XL665 and antiphosphoresidue antibody coupled to Europium cryptate, caused the juxtaposition of the cryptate and the XL665 fluorophore, resulting in fluorescence energy transfer (FRET). The FRET intensity depends on the amount of bounded cryptate antibody, which is proportional to the extent of substrate phosphorylation. FRET intensity was measured using Victor 2 V spectrofluorometer. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression (Hill equation) to generate a dose-response curve. The calculated IC50 value is the concentration of the test compound, which caused a 50% decrease in the maximal FRET intensity. Inhibition of TNFr Production Induced by LPS in the Human Monocytic Cell Line THP-1 Assay. For this purpose, 2 Â 105 cells/well were plated in tissue-culture treated round-bottom 96-well plates in RPMI (containing 10% FCS, L-Gln 2 mM, Hepes buffer 10 mM, sodium pyruvate 1 mM, glucose 4.5 g/L, NaHCO3 1.5 g/L and -mercaptoethanol 50 M), together with compounds at the desired test concentration and LPS (Sigma, L2630) at a final 10 g/mL concentration. Compounds were resuspended in 100% DMSO at a concentration of 1 mM and titrated thereof in 10Â dilutions in medium. Controls included unstimulated and stimulated cells treated with the highest concentration of compound vehicle (1% DMSO). Cells were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cell supernatant was recovered by centrifugation and diluted 5-fold prior to testing in a standard human TNFR ELISA (RnD systems). Inhibition of TNFr Production Induced by LPS in Human Whole Blood Assay. Healthy volunteer donor blood was collected by venipuncture in heparinized tubes. Two L of 10-fold compound concentrations in 100% DMSO were mixed with 200 L of LPS-stimulated blood in microtiter plates. Controls included unstimulated and stimulated blood treated with the highest concentration of compound vehicle (1% DMSO). Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with shaking. Supernatant was recovered by centrifugation and diluted one-sixth prior to testing in a standard TNFR ELISA (RnD systems). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression (Hill equation) to generate a dose-response curve. The calculated IC50 value corresponds to the concentration of the test compound, causing a 50% decrease in the maximal TNFR production (absolute IC50). In Vivo Assays. LPS-Induced TNFr in the Rat. One hour prior to LPS administration, rats were dosed orally with the compounds suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose/0.1% Tween80. LPS (5 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally, and 1.5 h later, rats were anesthesized and retroorbital blood collected in heparin tubes. Plasma was separated by centrifugation and diluted one-fifth prior to assaying in a standard rat TNF-alpha ELISA (RnD Systems). Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis (AIA) Model. Arthritis was induced by intraplantar administration of 100 L Mycobacter-

ium tuberculosis suspension (5 mg/mL in paraffin oil) in the left paw of male Wistar rats (Day 0). On day 11 postinoculation, animals were weighed and paw volume measured by plethismometry. Animals with left paw volumes ranging between 3.5 and 5 mL and right paw volumes between 2 and 3 mL were randomized in the required treatment groups (7 animals/ group). Treatment was started and continued for 7 consecutive days. On each day, animals were weighed and appropriately dosed orally with the indicated doses of compounds suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose/0.1% Tween 80. Paw volumes were monitored every other day. A healthy control group was inoculated with paraffin oil on day 0 and monitored thereafter for paw volumes and weight. At the end of the study, animals were euthanized with CO2. Inhibition percentage was calculated using last day contralateral (right) paw volumes.
