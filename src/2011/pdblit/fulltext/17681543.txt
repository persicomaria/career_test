Abstract
L-Glutamine:D-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase, also known as glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (GlcN6P synthase), which catalyzes the first step in a pathway leading to the formation of uridine 50 -diphospho-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), is a key point in the metabolic control of the biosynthesis of amino sugar-containing macromolecules. The molecular mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by GlcN6P synthase is complex and involves amide bond cleavage followed by ammonia channeling and sugar isomerization. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the present knowledge on this multi-faceted enzyme emphasizing the progress made during the last five years. Ó 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway starts from Dfructose-6-phosphate (Fru6P)2 which is produced from glucose via the glycolysis pathway. The Fru6P is converted into D-glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) by the rate-limiting enzyme glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (GlcN6P

synthase). Depending on its prokaryotic, lower or higher eukaryotic origin, GlcN6P synthases have been termed GlmS, Gfa or Gfat. This is the sole biosynthetic route to GlcN6P known to date. The latter can be deaminated into Fru6P and ammonia by the glucosamine-6P deaminase [1]. This enzyme, which essentially performs the opposite reaction to that of GlmS, is part of the catabolic pathway for the utilization of amino sugars as carbon sources. The two activities must be separated within the cell to avoid formation of a futile cycle. In the biosynthetic route GlcN6P is then isomerized into D-glucosamine-1-phosphate (GlcN1P) by the phosphoglucosamine mutase, and further converted into uridine diphospho-N-acetyl D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) by the GlcN1P acetyltransferase (Scheme 1). UDP-GlcNAc is an essential structural building block for the bacterial peptidoglycan, the lipopolysaccharide of Gram-negative bacteria, chitin, and mannoproteins of the fungal cell wall. Moreover, mannosamine and galactosamine derivatives used in the synthesis of polymers, such as chondroitin and keratan sulfates, are obtained through

epimerization of C-2 or C-4 of UDP-GlcNAc. This sugar nucleotide is also a substrate for virtually all glycosylation pathways potentially implicated in the regulation of glucose. The fact that GlcN6P synthase is controlling the amino sugar biosynthetic pathway has emphasized its role as a therapeutic target for the development of antifungal drugs [2], and more recently to prevent pathogenic complications resulting from type-2 diabetes [3]. In this context, it is of utmost importance to understand the molecular details of enzyme catalysis. We review here the state of the art in the study of GlcN6P synthase mainly on a chemical and enzymological basis. Since the Escherichia coli and Candida albicans enzymes have been recently reviewed [4,5] this article will mainly focus on the recent developments and on the questions that remain to be solved. GlcN6P synthase is a member of the L-glutamine-dependent amidotransferases (GATs) class of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of the amide nitrogen of L-glutamine to a wide variety of acceptors. In this family of close to 20 enzymes [6,7] some (e.g. those involved in the biosynthesis of histidine or tryptophan) are restricted to microorganisms. Other GATs (involved in de novo biosynthesis of nucleotides and aminosugars) are ubiquitous. Biochemical analyses of recombinant enzymes and determination of several structures by X-ray crystallography [4,5,8­20] have considerably improved our understanding of this particular class of enzymes. Comparisons of the mechanism of ammonia generation within this family led to the identification of two main sub-classes: class I enzymes use a catalytic triad whereas class II enzymes use the catalytic machinery of the N-terminal cysteine to perform the L-glutamine

amide bond cleavage. GlcN6P synthase belongs to the second subfamily. GlcN6P synthase (L-glutamine: D-fructose-6P amidotransferase, EC 2.6.1.16) converts Fru6P into GlcN6P using L-glutamine (Gln) as a nitrogen donor according to Eq. (1): d-fructose-6P þ l-glutamine ! l-glutamate þ d-glucosamine-6P ð1Þ

The enzymes from several eukaryotic sources, e.g., human [21­23], rat [24], mouse [25], and yeast [26,27], have been isolated. Two different genes encoding GlcN6P synthase have been found in the case of mice, humans and the nitrogen-fixating bacterium Rhizobium leguminosarum. The two versions of the mammalian gene are known as gfat1 and gfat2, respectively. Their deduced amino acid sequences from the same organism are 79% identical. In addition, Gfat1Alt, the mRNA variant transcribed from the gfat1 gene is specific to striated muscle cells. It differs from its Gfat1 counterpart by a 54-base pair (bp) insert at nucleotide position 686 of the coding sequence and is supposed to be a splice variant [28]. There is evidence indicating that the human genes may differ with respect to their expression level in various tissues [29], but no data is available on the possible differences in the properties of the gene products. The human gfat1 gene is located on the 2p13 chromosome [30]. In legume plants, nodM codes for the GlcN6P synthase involved in production of GlcNAc oligomers serving as signaling molecules to induce nodule formation [31]. Among GlcN6P synthases, the E. coli enzyme (GlmS) is the best characterized protein.

Enzyme organization Escherichia coli GlmS is functional as a homodimer [32]. Each monomer is formed by two structural domains. The N-terminal glutaminase domain (NGlmS, residues 1­239) of 27 kDa hydrolyzes glutamine to glutamate and ammonia and the C-terminal synthase domain (CGlmS, residues 249­608) of 40 kDa utilizes ammonia for the synthesis of GlcN6P. The latter domain is formed by the association of two synthase (SIS) domains related by a pseudo-dyad axis of symmetry. This class of domains, recently identified [33] from alignment studies, has been found in a variety of proteins that have a common role in phosphosugar isomerization and more generally that are able to bind phosphosugar. Structures of the whole enzyme [15,17] have shed light on the arrangement of the domains relative to each other. The dimer interface is formed by two synthase domains related by a 2-fold crystallographic axis. The two corresponding glutaminase domains are located on opposite sides of the dimer (Fig. 1A) [14,34]. The synthase and glutaminase domains are connected by a flexible linker (residues 240­248), which allows large movements of the glutaminase domains relative to the synthase domains during the catalytic cycle. These movements, which are triggered by substrate binding, ensure the signaling between the domains. The intramolecular mobility of the glutaminase domains of Fru6P-bound GlmS is presumed to facilitate the 23° hinge-bending motion of the glutaminase domain relative to the synthase domain that occurs upon glutamine binding and so allows the maintenance of the dimer interface [35,36]. Comparison of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic GlcN6P synthases Sharing 35­55% sequence identity with their bacterial homologues, GlcN6P synthases from higher organisms conserve all the active-site residues, which suggest a similar catalytic mechanism. However they possess an additional region of 50­70 amino acids at the C-terminal end of the glutaminase domain. While the bacterial enzyme is dimeric, the eukaryotic enzyme is tetrameric in solution as shown by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) for GlcN6P synthase from C. albicans, Gfa1 [19]. Several crystal structures of the Gfa1 synthase domain revealed that the tetramer of Gfa1 can be described as a dimer of two tight dimers with the architecture of one tight dimer resembling that of GlmS (Fig. 1B). Residues whose side-chains are involved in the tetrameric interface in Gfa1 within the synthase domain are not conserved in E. coli. In both GlmS and Gfa1, each synthase domain is formed by two topologically identical subdomains displaying an a/b structure characteristic of nucleotide-binding proteins which seem to have evolved by gene duplication and subsequent dimerisation (Fig. 1). The secondary structures of the synthase domains of GlmS and Gfa1 are similar except that Gfa1 possesses one addi-

tional helix between strand C3 (residues 516­519 in GlmS) and helix CF (residues 525­538 in GlmS) but does not have helix CE (residues 500­509 in GlmS). Superposition of the synthase active sites of one synthase monomer of E. coli GlmS in complex with Fru6P and Gfa1 in complex with UDP-GlcNAc and Fru6P [19] (Fig. 2) highlights large differences in the relative orientations of subunits forming a dimer, in particular concerning the position of helix CF, which interacts with the His-loop (residues 503­505 in GlmS). Although most of the residues involved in the inter-subunit contacts are conserved in the two enzymes, their interactions are different. Given the disorder of the C-tail and histidine loop in Gfa1, the different dimer interfaces of GlmS and Gfa1 might result from an active state of the synthase site in GlmS versus an inactive state in Gfa1 rather than depend on their bacterial or eukaryotic origin. Enzyme mechanism Despite its apparent simplicity, this irreversible enzymatic reaction (i.e., no Fru6P formation from GlcN6P [37]) raises a number of basic questions concerning the mechanism of the catalysis: (i) How does the enzyme perform amide bond cleavage? (ii) How is the released nitrogen transferred to fructose-6P and in what form? (iii) What is the nature of the reaction occurring on the sugar? (iv) Is the mechanism similar in the enzymes from different sources? Among all the known GlcN6P synthases, the E. coli protein is the only one for which the kinetic mechanism has been investigated in detail. It follows an ordered bi­bi process where Fru6P binds before Gln. Following glutamine hydrolysis, ammonia transfer and isomerization of the ammonia:sugar adduct, GlmS successively releases glutamate (hemi-synthase activity) and GlcN6P (synthase activity) [38]. In the absence of Fru6P, the enzyme exhibits only a weak hydrolyzing activity of glutamine into glutamate (glutaminase activity) whereas in the absence of glutamine it shows a phosphoglucose isomerase-like activity leading to Fru6P/Glc6P equilibration (isomerase activity) [39]. Scheme 3 illustrates the four activities which can be measured in GlcN6P synthases. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters A broad range of values of the kinetic parameters have been reported (Table 1) for the different known GlcN6P synthases. They not only depend upon the origin of the protein, the purification strategy and the phosphorylation state, but also on the enzyme assay used. No direct measurements of the dissociation constant for the substrates or the products have been reported. Nevertheless, the KD of Fru6P has been estimated from indirect experiments. It varies from 0.33 lM [40] to 50 lM [41] for the E. coli enzyme and from 2.4 lM [42] to 5 lM [22] for the human one. In the case of Gln, a KD of 99 lM [43] has been

Like other N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases, the GlmS glutaminase domain is composed mainly of antiparallel b-sheets. The C-tail (residues 600­608, brown coil), which plays a key role in sugar binding, catalysis and communication between the two active sites, lies at the interface between one glutaminase and one synthase domain of the same monomer. The His-loop (residues 503­505, orange coil) of the neighboring subunit also participates in shielding the synthase site. The Q-loop (residues 73-81, pink coil) covers the glutaminase site upon glutamine binding. Linear Fru6P is shown in pink stick representation. (B) Candida albicans Gfa1. The synthase domains of Gfa1 are organized as a tetramer. Each monomer is shown in different shades of green. A loop (residues 522­528, pink coil) linking helix NH (residues 505­521) and strand CA (residues 529­549) from chains A and D (or B and C) together with interactions between chains A and C (or B and D) through arginines 394 and 442 (shown in stick representation in the middle) are responsible for the tetrameric interface of Gfa1. The His-loop when ordered is shown by an orange coil and Glc6P in yellow stick representation.

Fig. 2. Comparison of one synthase dimer of GlmS and Gaf1. The secondary structure elements in one synthase dimer of GlmS (monomers in blue and cyan) and Gfa1 (monomers in light and dark green) are preserved, except helix CE (residues 500­509 in GlmS), which follows the His-loop (in magenta), which is present only in GlmS, and the helix between strand C3 and helix CF (in red), which is present only in Gfa1. When two corresponding monomers are superimposed (right), the other monomers (left) are oriented differently, the angle between the CF helices being around 30°. In Gfa1, the His-loop is either disordered or adopts a different conformation than the His-loop in GlmS (orange coil) and the entire C-tail as well as the four preceding residues are disordered. In GlmS, the latter residues interact with the main chain of helix CE through four H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions so that, in Gfa1, their disorder is probably linked to the disorder of the His-loop and the absence of the CE helix. In addition, the residue following the His-loop is an isoleucine in Gfa1 (instead of a proline in GlmS) and the residue that makes a salt bridge with the lysine residue of the His-loop in GlmS (Glu535#) is not conserved (Gln638# in Gfa1), which probably contributes to the flexibility of the His-loop. Linear Fru6P is shown in yellow or pink for Gfa1 and GlmS, respectively. Other elements are colored as in Fig. 1.

nitrogen donor [32]. They are subject to a 74 [18]­130 [13]-fold Fru6P induced activation of glutamine hydrolysis (kcat hemisynthase/kcat glutaminase), which might be considered as a strategy to save glutamine in the cell. Some other ligands of the Fru6P binding site, such as GlcN6P or GlcNAc6P, have the ability to stimulate this Gln hydrolytic activity in hGfat1 [42], but this has not been systematically studied. The recent crystallographic structures provide a rational explanation for this highly regulated activity (see below). Molecular mechanism The desire to understand this rather complex reaction at the molecular level has motivated a large number of kinetic, biochemical, and structural studies mainly focused on the E. coli and C. albicans enzymes. The crystal structures of the E. coli glutaminase domain (NGlmS) in complex with glutamate and with c-glutamyl hydroxamate (Scheme 2) [13] and of the E. coli synthase domain (CGlmS) in complex with GlcN6P, Glc6P or 2-amino-glucitol-6P (Scheme 2) [14,34] allowed to identify the binding site residues and to propose a mechanism at each active site [5]. Subsequently, various structures of the whole GlmS protein have been determined: alone [36], in complex with Fru6P [17], with both Glc6P and the glutamine analog DON (Scheme 2) [17], and with GlcN6P [36]. GlmS is the first glutamine amidotransferase for which the structure has been determined for more than two reaction intermediates. Comparison of these structures allowed to obtain information on the conformational changes that might occur during the catalytic cycle (See Table 2). The overall reaction involves three steps (i) hydrolysis of glutamine, (ii) transfer of the released ammonia to Fru6P,

and (iii) isomerization of the resulting fructose-imine-6P. Furthermore, it has been shown, at least in the case of GlmS [38], that the reaction is initiated upon binding of Fru6P, making this event a key step of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Although the molecular mechanism of the isomerization step was quite well established at the time of the previous reviews [4,5], those of all the other steps were still unclear or unknown. In the present report we describe these different steps in the presumed order of the enzymatic process with a special emphasis on the recent findings. Fructose-6P binding to the isomerase domain GlcN6P synthase catalyzes the formation of GlcN6P from Fru6P, which is present in solution as a mixture of two cyclo-furanosides (b and a) and a linear form in a ratio of 82/16/2 at equilibrium (Scheme 2) [44]. While the use of the linear keto form to generate the Fru6P imine intermediate is necessary, there is still an uncertainty about the form that is first recognized by the enzyme as well as its access to the active site. On the one hand, the data arguing for recognition of the open form are the following: (i) the rates of spontaneous ring opening of the a and b fructofuranose-6P forms, respectively 18 and 21 sÀ1, are comparable to the catalytic rate of GlmS and therefore compatible with the use of the linear form; (ii) none of the structures of the protein complexes obtained in the presence of Fru6P reveals the presence of the cyclized furanose. In the case of the GlcN6P deaminase, which catalyzes the reverse reaction, it has been demonstrated that Fru6P is recognized and processed as the linear form [45]. On the other hand the data arguing for cyclic form recognition cannot be neglected: (i) the reduced linear analogs of the keto sugar, glucitol-6P [39,46] and mannitol-6P (Scheme 2) are very

poor competitive inhibitors of GlmS with KI far beyond the estimated KD of Fru6P (mM versus lM); (ii) the mixed-type inhibition, in the millimolar range, caused by the carbocyclic analog of fructofuranose-6P [5] argues for the recognition of cyclic furanose by the enzyme. By analogy with the mechanism of action of other sugar isomerases and analysis of the GlmS crystal structures, a mechanism for the binding and consecutive opening of the cyclic sugar has been proposed (Scheme 4) [5,34,36]. The Fru6P binding site of the synthase domain consists mainly of the C-terminal-tail (residues 600­608) and the main-chain residues of the sequence Lys503#-His504#Gly505# (His-loop, #indicates that the residue belongs to the neighboring monomer) from the neighboring monomer (Fig. 3A). Comparison of the structures of GlmS alone and in complex with sugar indicates that the last seven residues of the C-tail become ordered upon sugar binding and cover the synthase site (Fig. 3A). In the structures of GlmS or C GlmS in complex with cyclic pyranose sugars, the synthase site is closed in a relaxed way because of few interactions between the C-tail and the synthase domain. On the contrary, linear sugars are buried in the synthase site, directly contacting the Glu488 and Lys485 catalytic residues. By comparing the structures of various GlmS complexes, it has been suggested that, after binding a cyclic sugar, the ordering of the glutaminase domains triggers a conformational change of the side-chain of Lys503# that strengthens the interactions between the C-tail and the synthase domain (Fig. 3A) [36]. This would lead to sugar ring opening by His504# and to burying of the newly formed linear sugar. The synthase site becomes completely inaccessible to solvent and the reaction can proceed further. However, in the case of the Gfa1 synthase domain complexed with GlcN6P, the corresponding His-607 is out of hydrogen bonding distance. The observed binding mode of cyclic Glc6P leaves no room for the imidazole ring of the catalytic histidine to bind as in GlmS [19]. The synthase binding site, which is constituted mostly by the C-tail and the His-loop in GlmS, is not properly formed in Gfa1. The His-loop is either disordered or has a very different conformation compared to that in GlmS. Furthermore,

the entire C-tail and the five preceding residues are disordered in each subunit of all structures. It is probable that, in Gfa1, an ordering of the C-tail is required for the correct positioning of the sugar, so that the catalytic histidine is ready to open the sugar ring. Glutamine hydrolysis Activation of the glutaminase active site upon binding of the acceptor substrate is a general feature of GATs. These enzymes have evolved mechanisms for transmission of the acceptor substrate binding information to the glutaminase active site. Furthermore, GlcN6P synthases are among the few GATs that possess no ammonia-dependent activity and thus are totally dependent on the hydrolysis of glutamine for ammonia supply. A detailed mechanism for this hydrolytic reaction has been proposed based on structural, mutational, affinity labeling and inhibition studies [4,5,13] (Scheme 5). Recent structures highlight the shielding of the activesite residues and the activation of several catalytic residues involved in the glutamine hydrolysis upon ligand binding. Comparison of the structures of GlmS in complex with Fru6P and in complex with Glu6P and DON (Scheme 2, affinity labeling reagent for the Cys1 SH group) reveals the conformational changes occurring upon occupation of the glutamine binding site (Fig. 3B). Upon DON binding, the glutaminase site is closed by the Q-loop (residues 73­81) and the 121­125 loops. These two loops contribute to the precise positioning inside the glutaminase site of the glutamine analog through hydrogen bonds between its acarboxyl group and Arg73, and between its a-amino group and Asp123, respectively [17]. Moreover, the hydroxyl group of Thr606 of the C-tail is reoriented to form an Hbond with the a-amino group of Cys1. This enhances the basicity of the terminal a-amino group, which acts as a general base, and induces the deprotonation of the Cys1 thiol group via the relay of a water molecule. The activated nucleophilic thiolate so formed can attack the amide carbon of the substrate and generate an oxyanionic tetrahedral intermediate. In addition, Asn98 is repositioned to contribute to the oxyanion hole that stabilizes the negative

Fig. 3. Conformational changes in GlmS upon ligand binding. (A) Conformational changes upon sugar binding. Superposition of the synthase sites of the structures of GlmS alone (synthase domain in yellow and orange) and in complex with Fru6P (synthase domain in light and dark blue, glutaminase domain in cyan) shows that the C-tail becomes ordered and covers the synthase site when a sugar is bound. Upon ordering of the glutaminase domains via the anchoring of Trp74 on the C-tail, Lys503# undergoes a conformational change. The concomitant conformational change of His504# and the His-loop backbone opens the sugar ring and buries the newly formed linear sugar. (B) Conformational changes upon Gln binding. Superposition of the glutaminase sites of the structures of GlmS in complex with Fru6P (in cyan) and in complex with Glc6P and DON (in green) shows that, upon Gln binding, the glutaminase site is closed by the Q-loop, Arg73 and Asp123 are repositioned to anchor the a-amino and a-carboxyl groups of glutamine, Cys1 and Asn98 are repositioned in a catalytically active conformation.

charge developing on the carbonyl oxygen atom of glutamine. The correct relative positioning of the Cys1 and Asn98 activates glutamine hydrolysis. After accepting a proton from the water molecule, ammonia is released and transferred to the acceptor site. Deacylation of the c-glutamyl thioacyl enzyme intermediate involves another water molecule that can be activated through the same mechanism. Although the recent structures do not permit a definite explanation of the activation of glutamine hydrolysis triggered by the acceptor binding, a two-step activation process involving ligands of the synthase site and glutamine, similar to that recently proposed for glutamate synthase (class II GAT), can be envisaged [47]. In the case of hGfat1, glutamine hydrolysis activation has been reported with Fru6P, GlcN6P, and GlcNAc6P [42]. However it is still not known if this phenomenon is ligand specific or just relies on the occupancy of the sugar binding site.

Ammonia transfer The first structure of native GlmS [15] revealed that the ° glutamine and the sugar phosphate sites are 20 A apart, which suggested intramolecular channeling of the nascent ammonia between the remote active sites. Shielding ammonia from bulk solvent through hydrophobic channels to avoid its protonation and to retain its nucleophilic character now appears to be a common feature of the GATs [12,20,48]. Based on more recent structural, molecular dynamic and mutational studies, information about the formation of the ammonia channel and the mechanism of the transfer has also been gained for GlmS [17,49]. The C-terminal loop, the backbone of the His-loop as well as the indole group of Trp74 and the main-chain of Arg26 from the glutaminase domain constitute the walls of the ammonia channel in its open conformation (Fig. 4). The channel is not formed in the free enzyme in which the C-

terminal loop is disordered. Its formation is initiated upon sugar binding and continued upon ordering of the gluta-

minase domains through the positioning of the Trp74 and Arg26 main-chains. The indole group of Trp74 blocks

the channel when the glutaminase site is empty [15,17], which explains why, unlike most other GATs, GlmS cannot use exogenous ammonia as the nitrogen donor. It may also act as a solvent barrier preventing water molecules from entering the channel [49], which is therefore fully functional only upon glutamine binding. A similar channel structure and role of the homologous Trp97 as a gate has been proposed for Gfa1 [18]. The driving force leading the ammonia molecule through the channel to the sugar remains unknown. However, molecular dynamics simulations [49] have highlighted the role of local flexibility and seem to implicate two water molecules found in the channel as described for indole-3glycerol phosphate (IGP) synthase [50,51]. Although it was initially believed that among the class II GATs, asparagine synthetase [52] was the only one for which the glutaminase and synthetase activities appear to be imperfectly coordinated, recent results have shown that it is also the case for GlmS although to a lesser extent. As a result, L-glutamate and GlcN6P are formed in a 1/0.84 ratio under steady-state conditions [49]. This 16% leakage of ammonia has not really been rationalized yet, but could result from GlcN6P-induced activation of the glutaminase activity as observed in the case of hGfat1 [42]. From a heuristic point a view, producing slightly more ammonia than actually required may be a means to ensure full activity of the sophisticated machinery in charge of the GlcN6P synthesis. Phosphosugar isomerization The channeled ammonia is transferred to a putative activated linear form of Fru6P to generate the corresponding ketimine (Scheme 4). This form has been proposed to be a covalent imine adduct between the keto group of Fru6P and the e-amino group of Lys603 of GlmS (called a Schiff base in the following) [53]. Trapping experiments demonstrated the formation of a Schiff base between Lys603 and pyridoxal 50 -phosphate, a competitive inhibitor of Fru6P. Moreover replacement of Lys603 by Arg, using site-directed mutagenesis, resulted in a 40-fold decrease in kcat for GlcN6P synthesis without affecting the Km for Fru6P [54]. While the involvement of Lys603 in the mechanism is undeniable, the limited effect of its substitution and the absence of any other experimental evidence makes the existence of the proposed imine still a matter of debate. In the case of IGP synthase [55], a class I GAT using also a sugar-imine as intermediate, no Schiff base activation is required. The only Lys present in the substrate binding-site participates in the interdomain communication through hydrogen bonding with the substrate. However in the case of pyridoxal phosphate synthase, another class I GAT, the existence of two different Schiff bases between two Lys of the active site and the substrate ribulose-5P, has been proven unambiguously by crystallography [56] and mass spectrometry [57]. Mutations of either one of them completely abolished the enzyme activity, thus allowing the assignment of their respective roles [56]. One of them forms a Schiff

base with ribulose-5P to properly position the activated carbon at the end of the channel. This Schiff base then undergoes transimination with the ammonia channeled from the glutaminase site to afford the ribulose-5P imine. In the GlmS case, a similar role could be assigned to the Schiff base with Lys603. The consecutive isomerization step involves a stereospecific abstraction of the pro-R hydrogen from the C1 of the sugar, formation of a cis-enolamine intermediate and subsequent protonation of C2 at the same Re-face of the intermediate [37]. Glu488 is likely to be responsible for transferring the proton from C-1 to C-2 of the substrate. Tritium transfer experiments demonstrated the participation of a single enzyme base with an estimated pKa of 7.3, which is in good agreement with a carboxylic residue with reduced acidity [37]. In the crystal structures, the carboxylate group of Glu488 of GlmS (or Glu591 of Gfa1) is at van der Waals type interaction distance of the C1 and C2 of the linear Fru6P [19]. It forms only one hydrogen bond with OH-1 of 2-aminoglucitol-6P, an analog of the open form of the product [15], but two hydrogen bonds with OH-1 and NH-2 of 2-aminomannitol-6P, the C2 epimeric analog [19]. For the latter compound the amino group is located at the position of the proton normally transferred during the reaction. It has been also suggested that Lys485 may abstract a proton from the O1 hydroxyl of the enolamine intermediate. Different versions of the same mechanism have been proposed [17,34,46]. The last step of the process is the release of the product as a cyclic pyranose. In the structures of GlmS or CGlmS in complex with cyclic pyranose sugars, the synthase site is closed in a relaxed way because of few interactions between the C-tail and the synthase domain. Thus, the cyclic sugar is not deeply bound in the synthase site. It interacts with the synthase site residues via water molecules, but makes numerous direct contacts with the C-tail. According to kinetic studies, imine formation and GlcN6P release should represent the two steps of highest energy of the reaction with the first one requiring 1.9 kcal/mol more than product release [37]. Enzyme regulation GlcN6P synthase is present in all known organisms. Due to its central role in amino sugar biosynthesis, it is not surprising that the activity of this enzyme is tightly controlled. The nature of this regulation is highly species dependent. Regulation in prokaryotic organisms Transcriptional regulation In E. coli, the enzymes of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway are encoded by the glmUS operon. GlmU is a bifunctional enzyme that sequentially converts GlcN1P to GlcNAc1P then UDP-GlcNAc (Scheme 1). The glmUS operon is transcribed from two promoters that are both located upstream of glmU. Since no promoter has been

P. Durand et al. / Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics 474 (2008) 302­317

313

detected upstream of glmS, this implies that the glmU and glmS genes are strictly co-expressed. Initially, it was observed that the GlmS protein level decreased in the presence of exogenous amino sugars [58]. This was shown to be due to NagC, the transcriptional factor of the N-acetylglucosamine (nag) regulon, acting as an activator for the glmU p1 promoter in the absence of N-acetylglucosamine [59]. This observation, which explained the increased level of both GlmU and GlmS in the absence of an environmental supply of amino sugars, was not fully satisfactory: GlmU, which catalyses the first committed step in the biosynthesis of essential cell wall peptidoglycan and outer membrane lipopolysaccharide components, is required whether amino sugars are derived from the medium or are synthesized by GlmS. This paradox has been clarified by the recent observation of a very complex post-transcriptional regulation of glmS expression. Post-transcriptional regulation The glmUS mRNA was found to be processed by RNaseE at the level of the glmU termination codon [60]. Mutations in at least two loci led to a substantial stabilization of the processed glmS transcript and therefore to enhanced GlmS protein levels. Proteomic analysis of a pcnB mutant showed about 20-fold more GlmS than in the wild type strain [60]. pcnB encodes poly(A) polymerase (PAP1); it has been demonstrated by macroarray analysis, that more than 90% of the transcripts corresponding to open reading frames (ORFs) are polyadenylated by PAP1 in exponentially growing cultures of E. coli [61]. It is currently believed that the major role of PAP1 in prokaryotes is the addition of oligoA tails to facilitate the degradation of structured RNAs by exoribonucleases. However, it was not clear that the very strong and specific stabilization of the glmS mRNA could be due to a direct effect of PAP1 on the processed glmS mRNA. Simultaneously, Kalamorz et al. [62] showed that stabilization of the glmS mRNA was also caused by a decrease in GlmS enzyme activity, which would account for a logical feedback regulation of GlmS levels by that of GlcN6P. Two different small RNAs (sRNAs) have been implicated in this retroregulation in E.coli. They are now called GlmZ [62] and GlmY [63] and, when overexpressed, either of these sRNAs also caused the accumulation of the glmS transcript and the GlmS protein [62,63]. These small RNAs, unlike most sRNAs in E.coli, enhance gene expression rather than inhibiting translation or leading to mRNA degradation. Their stabilization of the processed glmS mRNA, is probably responsible for the uncoordinated expression of glmU and glmS. Another clue to this complex regulation was the discovery that a mutation in an uncharacterized gene, yhbJ, of the rpoN operon, also produced high level expression of GlmS and stabilization of the processed glmS transcript [62]. GlmS overexpression produced by the yhbJ mutation, was dependent upon the GlmZ RNA and moreover the yhbJ mutation led to the stabilization of the GlmZ sRNA.

With these elements to hand, Kalamorz et al. [62] proposed a model for GlmS regulation (Scheme 6). They hypothesize that YhbJ somehow senses GlcN6P levels, which in turn controls the level of full length GlmZ sRNA. Thus low GlcN6P concentrations will enhance GlmZ stability, glmS mRNA and protein levels. Many questions remain to be answered, not least how is the GlcN6P concentration sensed and what are the relative roles of the GlmZ and GlmY sRNAs. In Bacillus subtilis, GlmS levels are also subject to GlcN6P-sensitive regulation. However as opposed to E. coli, which uses trans-acting sRNAs to control glmS expression, this regulation is achieved via a cis-acting riboswitch, which is also a ribozyme [64]. This structured RNA, belongs to a new class of riboswitches that are able to regulate gene expression upon binding of a small metabolite [65]. The glmS ribozyme is the first example of a ribozyme that is also a riboswitch (Scheme 7). It is activated by the natural metabolite GlcN6P and thus couples GlcN6P levels with mRNA cleavage [66,67]. The ribozyme is highly specific for GlcN6P which produces a 1000-fold acceleration in the spontaneous cleavage rate. The cleavage, which has been shown to reduce expression of a glmS-lacZ fusion, occurs in the untranslated leader 245 bp upstream of the glmS AUG codon. The mechanism by which this cleavage affects glmS mRNA translation or stability has not been investigated. Through biosynthetic end-products GlmS is inhibited by the reaction product, GlcN6P, but only at millimolar concentrations [68]. This property of the prokaryotic enzyme, which has been observed for many different bacterial species seems to be a common feature, but it is not known whether it is of physiological importance. Prokaryotic GlmS are not affected by UDP-GlcNAc, the final product of the hexosamine biosynthesis

When the amount of GlcN6P exceeds that needed for cell growth, it activates the ribozyme to cleave the mRNA and the segment coding for the synthase is not translated. When the amount of GlcN6P is too low, the ribozyme is inactive, and more GlmS is made.

pathway which is responsible for the feedback regulation of eukaryotic Gfat [3,69]. Regulation in eukaryotic organisms Transcriptional regulation Several examples of transcriptional regulation of Gfat expression in eukaryotic cells have been found. Expression of the yeast gene is strongly enhanced upon the action of a mating pheromone, a-factor, on haploid cells. The DNA sequence for pheromone control of transcription is present in the promoter region of the gene [7]. The regulation of the gfa gene expression in yeast cells has also been reported to involve Glc7p protein phosphatase [70]. The analysis of the promoters of gfat1 and gfat2 from mouse showed that they contain a CCAAT box, several GC boxes, Sp1, AP-1, and AP-2 sites but lack a canonical TATA box [71,72]. On the other hand, Angiotensin II, via the AT1 receptor, activated the gfat promoter in mesangial cells [73]. Gfat is also subject to a strict tissue-dependent regulation [29] in mammals. In humans, the expression of the two gfat isoforms [21,28,71,72,74,75] is highly regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Gfat1 expression is generally predominant over that of gfat2 in all cell types except kidney [74]. In liver, no signal of gfat2 was detected. Post-transcriptional and translational gene regulation Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have distinct compartments for transcription and translation, and mRNA are monocistronic. There are also speculations that a riboswitch-mediated control mechanism might play an important role in eukaryotic gene expression. These riboswitches can be found in the 30 or 50 untranslated regions (UTRs) or within introns [76]. Nothing similar has been reported in the Gfat case. Through biosynthetic end-products inhibition Eukaryotic GlcN6P synthases are feedback inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc: the KI reported vary from 4 lM for hGfat1 and 6 lM for the rat liver enzyme up to 0.7 mM for Gfa1 from C. albicans [42,69,77]. The inhibition of hGfat1 from

fibroblasts was reported to occur at concentrations of UDP-GlcNAc above 25 lM [78]. This product inhibits the rat liver enzyme competitively with respect to Fru6P and non-competitively with respect to Gln [79]. The inhibition is non-competitive with respect to both substrates in the case of C. albicans and Neurospora crassa [77,80], while it is uncompetitive in the case of the Aspergillus nidulans protein [81]. In the case of the enzyme from Blastocladiella emersonii, the inhibition is uncompetitive with respect to Gln and competitive with respect to Fru6P [82]. In the case of Gfa1, tryptophan fluorescence-based mechanistic studies have suggested that a conformational change of the isomerase domain is triggered by UDP-GlcNAc binding. This is subsequently transmitted to the glutaminase domain through interdomain interactions and affects the amidohydrolysing activity [18]. The crystal structure of the tetrameric isomerase domain of Gfa1 in complex with UDP-GlcNAc was recently reported [19] and allowed the ° identification of the UDP-GlcNAc binding site 10 A away from the synthase site. The residues responsible for binding UDP-GlcNAc are conserved only among eukaryotic sequences. The uridyl moiety of the inhibitor interacts with the protein while the glucosamine moiety points away from it. Gly474 and Gly490 that shape the binding pocket of UDP-GlcNAc in Gfa1, are replaced by alanines in GlmS. The rigidity of Ala together with its bulkiness would not allow UDP-GlcNAc to bind to GlmS. Moreover the 381­ 388 loop of Gfa1 that binds the phosphate and the ribose ring of UDP-GlcNAc has a very different conformation in GlmS. As the structures of the synthase domain with or without UDP-GlcNAc are very similar, it is likely that the structure of the whole enzyme is necessary to unveil the molecular basis for the inhibition by UDP-GlcNAc. The nucleotide binding site bears no relationship to the hypothetical site identified from in silico homology modeling [83]. A recent study revealed that GlcN6P is also a potent inhibitor of hGfat1 [42]. The early reports of an activator behavior of vitamins K1 and K3 [84] and the antagonist properties of cholesterol and hydrocortisone [85] on rat liver enzyme are certainly worthy of further investigation.

Through post-translational phosphorylation Analysis of the primary structures of Gfat revealed a number of potential phosphorylation sites for different protein kinases. Gfats are subjected to phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA upregulated the activity of Gfat from rat liver [86], Drosophila melanogaster [87], and C. albicans [77]. In contrast, in vitro phosphorylation of recombinant hGfat1 by PKA reduced enzyme activity [88]. The authors argued that PKA regulation might be isoform-dependent. Two putative PKA sites (Ser205 and Ser235) are present in hGfat1, while only one is present in hGfat2 (Ser205). Indeed mouse Gfat2 was stimulated by PKA in vitro [25]. Overexpression of hGfat1 in insect cells [22] revealed that hGfat1 is phosphorylated in vivo. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, Ser243 was identified as a novel phosphorylation site [23]. The comparison of the biochemical properties of the wild type and the Ser243Glu mutant of hGfat1, overexpressed in E. coli, provided evidence that phosphorylation at Ser243 stimulates GlcN6P synthesizing activity, lowers glutaminase activity (GlUPA hydrolysis without Fru6P) and causes a 2-fold decrease of the Km value for Fru6P. However, it has no effect on UDP-GlcNAc inhibition. On the basis of the sequence consensus analysis, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) sites were predicted and their phosphorylation site was specifically identified as Ser243 in vitro. Phosphorylation by these two kinases results in a 1.4-fold increase of hGfat1 activity. These findings suggest for the first time that hGfat1 may be regulated by kinases other than PKA. Two recent proteomic studies performed on nocodazole or epidermal growth factor treated HeLa cells, independently identified Ser243 as the phosphorylation site in hGfat1. This finding unequivocally confirms that Ser243 is a basal phosphorylation site in living cells [89,90]. Although the physiological relevance of this finding awaits further investigation, it is of particular interest since it indicates a potential direct link between hexosamine biosynthesis and the AMPK signaling pathway via hGfat regulation. AMPK is proposed to be a metabolic switch, whose downstream substrates include key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and glucose transport [91]. A recent study showing that AMPK activity is regulated by hexosamine biosynthesis in adipocytes constitutes the first report to confirm the functional link between the pathways [92]. The B. emersonii enzyme exists in two forms, which are interconvertible through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of serine residues. UDP-GlcNAc plays a dual role in hexosamine and chitin synthesis in zoospores: it not only inhibits the phosphorylated form of the enzyme, but it also prevents its dephosphorylation by inhibiting protein phosphatases 2A and 2C [82,93]. Taken together, it is clear that the regulation of eukaryotic Gfat is complex which has just started to be understood.

Conclusion and perspectives The understanding of the molecular events governing GlcN6P synthase catalysis has indisputably progressed during the last few years. Such improvement results from the combination of the mechanistic enzymology investigations of an increasing number of GATases with the resolution of several X-ray structures trapped at different steps of the catalytic process. Despite a better understanding of the GlcN6P synthase organization and the analysis of its conformational changes a number of mechanistic problems, that have been addressed in this review, remain to be solved. The current syntheses of substrate and high energy intermediate analogs with locked conformations or with modified reactivities will help investigating the nature of the recognized substrate (acyclic/cyclic sugar and anomeric preference, tolerance to substitution. . .) as well as the mechanism of reaction between Fru6P and ammonia. Besides the in-depth knowledge of its catalytic mechanism, these detailed data should be helpful in the design of specific inhibitors of this key enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Indeed, Gfa1 inhibition has already been shown to promote fungi cell death arguing for potential application of inhibitors in antimicrobial therapy. The recent discovery of regulation mechanisms specific to prokaryotes might be a new strategy to selectively control microorganism proliferation. The recent implication of hexosamine biosynthetic pathway as one of the routes responsible for the type 2 diabetes complications makes the human enzyme an attractive therapeutic target to be validated. Although new compounds have emerged from screening experiments, there is still a long road to reach potential applications. Acknowledgments This research was supported by the C.N.R.S.
