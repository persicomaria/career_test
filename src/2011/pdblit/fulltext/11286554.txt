The structure of the T  3 single stranded RNA tymovirus, physalis motÊ tle virus (PhMV), has been determined to 3.8 A resolution. PhMV crystals belong to the rhombohedral space group R3, with one icosahedral particle in the unit cell leading to 20-fold non-crystallographic redundancy. Polyalanine coordinates of the related turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) with which PhMV coat protein shares 32 % amino acid sequence identity were used for obtaining the initial phases. Extensive phase re®nement by real space molecular replacement density averaging resulted in an electron density map that revealed density for most of the side-chains and for the 17 residues ordered in PhMV, but not seen in TYMV, at the N terminus of the A subunits. The core secondary and tertiary structures of the subunits have a topology consistent with the capsid proteins of other T  3 plant viruses. The N-terminal arms of the A subunits, which constitute 12 pentamers at the icosahedral 5-fold axes, have a conformation very different from the conformations observed in B and C subunits that constitute hexameric capsomers with near 6-fold symmetry at the icosahedral 3-fold axes. An analysis of the interfacial contacts between protein subunits indicates that the hexamers are held more strongly than pentamers and hexamer-hexamer contacts are more extensive than pentamer-hexamer contacts. These observations suggest a plausible mechanism for the formation of empty capsids, which might be initiated by a change in the conformation of the N-terminal arm of the A subunits. The structure also provides insights into immunological and mutagenesis results. Comparison of PhMV with the sobemovirus, sesbania mosaic virus reveals striking similarities in the overall tertiary fold of the coat protein although the capsid morphologies of these two viruses are very different.

Most small spherical viruses consist of an RNA genome that is encapsidated in a protein shell made up of identical or a small number of chemically distinct subunits. The rigid structures of the capsids of simple isometric viruses have enabled detailed structural studies on their crystals by X-ray diffraction techniques (Harrison, 1983, 1995). Many of these isometric viruses consist of three chemically identical but structurally independent subunits in the icosahedral asymmetric unit designated as A, B and C (Figure 1; Harrison et al., 1978). X-ray diffraction studies on single crystals of virus particles provide detailed information on the

coat protein fold, molecular interactions between protein subunits and role of metal ions and other ligands in the stability of the capsid. They also provide insights into the mechanism of assembly and disassembly, and on evolutionary relationships that could exist between biologically distinct viruses. Examination of these three-dimensional structures also help in understanding the role of different polypeptide segments in the assembly of the viral capsid. For example, in viruses like southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV; AbadZapatero et al., 1980), tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV; Harrison et al., 1978), turnip crinkle virus (TCV; Hogle et al., 1986, Sorger et al., 1986) and sesbania mosaic virus (SMV; Bhuvaneswari et al., 1995) assembly of the virion is thought to be initiated by the formation of the so called b-annulus, made up of the ordered N-terminal regions of the three C subunits related by icosahedral 3-fold symmetry (Harrison, 1983, 1995). The disordered basic N-terminal arms of the A and B subunits are thought to interact with the viral nucleic acid, partially neutralizing the negative charges of the RNA phosphate groups. In turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV; Canady et al., 1996), the type member of the tymogroup of plant viruses, the N-terminal arm has been proposed to be important for the formation of hexameric capsomeres at the icosahedral 3-fold axes (Canady et al., 1996). Experimental veri®cation of these proposals requires systematic investigations on homologous virus structures and on the structures of deletion mutants of the coat proteins of these viruses.

Physalis mottle virus (PhMV) is a highly infectious virus that belongs to the tymo group of plant viruses. It was initially isolated in the state of Iowa in the United States. Due to its serological relationship to the European strain of belladonna mottle virus, it was earlier called as belladonna mottle virus-Iowa strain. Initial studies on this virus were published under this name (Munshi et al., 1987; Hiremath et al., 1990; Savithri et al., 1987; Suryanarayana et al., 1989; Jacob et al., 1992). However, detailed sequence comparisons, made after the coat protein sequences of a number of tymoviruses became available, indicated that this virus is not a strain of the European belladonna mottle virus and hence the virus was renamed as physalis mottle virus (Jacob et al., 1992). Comparison of the sequences of non-structural proteins also suggests that PhMV is distinct from BDMV-European isolate (Ranjith-Kumar et al., 1998). PhMV particles Ê have a diameter of about 300 A and are comprised of 180 protein subunits, each of 21 kDa, organized on a T  3 icosahedral lattice (Caspar & Klug 1962), encapsidating a single-stranded, positive sense RNA of size 6.3 kb (Jacob et al., 1992). PhMV particles require polyamines for their stability. Irrespective of the host plant used for propagation, virus particles are found to contain polyamines like putrescine and spermidine (Savithri et al., 1987; Cohen & Greenberg, 1981). Removal of these polyamines from the virions at alkaline pH leads to release of nucleic acid and formation of empty protein shells. Natural preparations of tymoviruses are comprised of particles containing the full-length genomic RNA but also empty protein shells (top component) suggesting the ability of the protein subunits to assemble into virus-like particles in the absence of viral nucleic acid. This observation suggests that protein-protein interactions are very strong in tymoviruses. In viruses like SBMV (Savithri & Erickson, 1983) and SMV (Gopinath et al., 1994), in vitro reassembly has been successfully demonstrated by mixing the isolated RNA and coat protein subunits. However, in viruses stabilized by strong protein-protein interactions, it is dif®cult to isolate coat protein subunits under non-denaturing conditions. Hence, in vitro reassembly experiments are not possible and the assembly of these viruses have to be studied using bacterially expressed recombinant viral coat protein and its mutants. The full-length gene coding for the PhMV coat protein (CP) and several genes coding for CP deletion mutants have been cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli (Sastri et al., 1997). The recombinant proteins were found to self assemble into virus like particles (see the accompanying paper Sastri et al., 1999). Some of these recombinant capsids have also been crystallized (unpublished results). Here, we present the structure of the wild-type virus.

921 The map contained signi®cant density in the Ê region between 90 and 104 A, as anticipated by statistics (see the molecular replacement section in Materials and Methods) of preliminary molecular replacement computations. The most striking result was the additional density observed at the N terminus of the A subunits. In TYMV, the N terminus of B and C subunits are ordered, while the ®rst 27 residues of A subunits are disordered (Canady et al., 1996). It was clear that a much larger portion of the PhMV A subunit's N terminus is ordered. It was possible to build residues 10-27 despite the low resolution of the map. A typical segment of this additionally ordered region of PhMV is shown in Figure 2(b). The models of A, B and C subunits that have been built account for almost all of the electron density of the ®nal map. The overall quality of the structure as judged by the stereochemical parameters (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968; Laskowski et al., 1993) is reasonably good for the resolution (Table 1), with about 2 % of the residues lying in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran diagram. Tymoviruses are known to contain polyamines. However, these polyamines are attached to RNA (Savithri et al., 1987) and no electron density that could be attributed to polyamines has been observed. Also an examination of the ®nal Fo À Fc difference Fourier map did not show any signi®cant density for possible polyamines or cations. Polypeptide fold As in other T  3 viruses, the icosahedral asymmetric unit consists of three independent but chemically identical subunits. These subunits (Figure 1) are designated as A, B and C following the nomenclature used by Harrison et al. (1978). The polypeptide folds into the now very familiar

Results
Structure solution Based on the cross-rotation function results, it was initially assumed that re®nement of TYMV polyalanine model suitably placed in the PhMV cell, followed by difference Fourier calculations would be suf®cient for obtaining the structure of PhMV without model bias. However, the results clearly indicated that this approach has severe limitations. Perhaps, the phase error with the polyalanine model and the limited resolution of the X-ray diffraction data (Table 1) do not lead to maps with signi®cant density for the majority of the sidechains. In contrast, real space electron density averaging based on the same initial phases led to a very high-quality map with signi®cant density for the majority of the side-chains and for the additionally ordered N-terminal segment of the A subunits. Electron-density map The electron-density map had density corresponding to most of the side-chains (Figure 2(a)). Interpretation of the electron density map was straightforward due to the availability of the homologous TYMV structure. The electron density was continuous throughout the main chain of all the three subunits. However, electron densities for residues 1-10 of the A subunit, ®rst residues of B and C subunits and the side-chains of residues E39, F43, Q51, T61, R68, Q71, Q107, K153, R177, R179, K182 and I186 of the A subunit, T26, T80, I108, K153, Y157, S165, Q173, L180 and K182 of the B subunit and K8, Q55, V86, I108, K153, Q173 and K182 of C the subunit were not visible in the map.

b-barrel motif found in the structures of many plant and animal viruses (Figure 3). The b-barrel consists of two b-sheets, each consisting of four strands. Following the nomenclature used in other viruses, the strands are designated as BIDG and CHEF (Figure 3). The structure mostly contains bstrands, connected by short segments and a few minor helices. These helical segments occur mostly in the virus exterior (Figure 3). The centroids of the A, B and C subunits are at Ê distances of 120, 122 and 124 A, respectively, from Ê the viral center and extend from 92 to 158 A in the Ê in B and C subunits, A subunit and 105 to 145 A respectively. Structural superposition of AB, BC and CA subunits shows that the A subunit's N-

terminal arm has a conformation very different from that of the latter two subunits. There is also substantial difference in the region 115-125 between A and B/C subunits. This segment of the polypeptide is a loop that approaches the icosahedral 5-fold axis in the pentameric A subunits, while it is near the icosahedral 3-fold in the hexameric BC subunits (Figure 3). The non-equivalent interactions near the symmetry axes contribute to the observed differences. The B and C subunits also display signi®cant differences in the structure of the N-terminal segment 1-27 re¯ecting the inherent ¯exibility of the N-terminal region of the polypeptide.

Five A subunits make up pentameric capsomeres at the icosahedral 5-fold, while BC subunits constitute hexamers at the icosahedral 3-fold axes. The secondary structures were determined by the program STRIDE (Frishman & Argos 1995).The A subunits are shown in green, the B subunits in red and the C subunits in cyan. (b) MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) diagram illustrating the strands of PhMV b-jelly roll motif. The nomenclature for the BIDG and CHEF strands follows Harrision et al. (1978).

The ordered part of the N terminus of A subunits starts at Lys10. This residue has been shown to cross-link with the nucleic acid upon UV irradiation (Kekuda et al., 1993). The N terminus starts on the RNA-facing side of the protein coat and is not accessible to solvent until residue 35. Comparison with TYMV The polypeptide fold of PhMV is very similar to that of TYMV. The orientation of the three subunits

with respect to the icosahedral symmetry and the centroids of B and C subunits are almost identical in the two viruses. However, the centroid of the A Ê subunit is closer to the viral center by about 2 A in PhMV. This is due to the additionally ordered Nterminal segment in PhMV. The centroids of the portion of A subunits ordered in both the viruses are nearly identical. Thus, although the amino acid sequence identity between TYMV and PhMV is small (32 %), the two viruses have a remarkably similar architecture. TYMV is longer by two resi-

924 dues at the C terminus, while PhMV has one additional residue at the N terminus. Figure 4(a)(c) illustrate the deviation of consecutive Ca atoms when the A, B and C subunits of PhMV are superimposed on the corresponding subunits of TYMV. Ê Deviations of about 3 A or more are observed at

the N terminus and at residues around 163. The differences at the N terminus re¯ect the ¯exibility of this segment. The residues 160-170 occur as a loop in the external surface of the virus. These differences are probably signi®cant, as similar deviations are observed in all the three compari-

925 123  . The angle between these rotation axes is about 9  . These architectural features are common to TYMV and a few other plant viruses, such as comoviruses and bromoviruses (Speir et al., 1995). Table 2 lists the type and number of contacts between subunits related by 5-fold, quasi-3-fold, quasi-6-fold, icosahedral 2-fold and quasi-2-fold axes. In these aspects, it is similar to TYMV although the number and type of interactions themselves are not well conserved (Table 2). Within the hexamers, the number of contacts in TYMV and PhMV are comparable (C-B2 and B5C). However, the contact between hexamers and pentamers (B5-A) are fewer in PhMV when compared to TYMV. Similarly, the contacts within the pentamers (A-A5) are fewer in PhMV. One of the remarkable features observed in the present case is the interaction of the N-terminal arm of A subunits with the quasi trimer of a neighboring icosahedral asymmetric unit. The capsid consists of 60 ABC subunits related by quasi-3-fold symmetry. The N-terminal arm of each of the 60 A subunits is associated with an ABC trimer (Figure 5). Speci®cally, the arm that interacts with the icosahedral asymmetric unit consisting of ABC subunits, is from the A2 subunit. This is illustrated in Figure 5(a). The A2 subunit's N-terminal arm travels beneath a B subunit and approaches a C subunit at the quasi-3-fold. It is not possible to dislodge a pentamer from the capsid without a conformational change of this arm (Figure 5(b)). This is of signi®cance in light of the results of neutron-scattering measurements, which suggest that a pentamer is removed from virions upon freezing and thawing (Katouzian-Safadi & Berthet-Colominas, 1983; Witz & Kruse, 1983; Witz et al., 1993).

sons. Additional differences are also observed between the A subunits of the two viruses at residue 124. In the A subunit, the largest difference is in the residues 10-27, which are ordered in PhMV but not in TYMV. The additional ordered residues in the A subunit have a conformation very different from the conformation seen for the arm in B and C subunits, the latter two being similar. In B and C subunits, the N-terminal arms bend and wrap around the respective subunits and towards the end assume b conformation with hydrogenbonding interactions with b-G (Figure 3). Intersubunit interactions As in other T  3 viruses, the coat protein consists of three icosahedrally independent subunits designated A, B and C (Figure 1). These subunits cluster as pentamers at the icosahedral 5-fold axes (A subunits) and hexamers (B and C subunits) at the icosahedral 3-fold axes (Figure 3). The hexamers and pentamers have a characteristic protrusion such that the virus extends maximally at the 5folds, signi®cantly at the 3-folds but is shallow at the quasi-3-fold. The rotation required to superpose C on B2 and C on B5 (quasi-6-fold relations) are 61.6  and 58.4  . These rotation axes are at an angle of 3.7  . Thus, the hexamer obeys nearly exact 6-fold symmetry. The quasi-2-fold axis relates the icosahedral 5-fold to the quasi-6-fold axis. This axis is at an angle of 34  and 35  from the icosahedral 5-fold and 3-fold (quasi-6-fold) axes and relates the A and B5 subunits. The rotation required for the superposition of these subunits is 177  . The subunits related by quasi-3-fold symmetry (A, B and C) could be superimposed on each other by rotations varying between 118 and

Pattern of residue conservation in tymoviruses Figure 6 shows the alignment of eight tymoviral sequences available in the SWISS-PROT database. It appears that the N-terminal half of the polypeptide is less well conserved when compared to the

C-terminal half. There is no contiguous stretch of sequence that is particularly well conserved. Figure 7 highlights the residues conserved in tymoviruses. Most conserved regions belong to segments involved in quasi-3-fold interactions. The residues involved in quasi-6-fold (icosahedral 3-

Of the 150 residues that constitute the PhMV coat protein b-barrel, 135 Ca atoms could be superposed onto SMV Ê with a RMS deviation of 2.65 A. All the insertions and deletions are con®ned to the loops that connect the secondary structural elements (Figure 8). Also, the helical segments occurring in loops connecting strands of the barrel are either eliminated or shortened in PhMV. Therefore, tymoviruses have a lower helical content and shorter loops between strands when compared to sobemoviruses.

In comparison, the residues that contribute to packing in the interior of the jelly roll barrel are not particularly well conserved. Comparison with SMV Systematic sequence comparison of tymo, sobemo (SMV, SBMV) and cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV; Speir et al., 1995) do not show signi®cant sequence similarity. Optimal alignment of SMV and PhMV sequences by the GAP program of GCG suite, shows only 8 % sequence identity. Despite this insigni®cant sequence identity, com-

acid identity and 1.4 minimum base change per codon (MBC) required to convert structurally equivalent SMV residues to those of PhMV. However, even this alignment is not signi®cant when examined by the GAP program. Visual examination of the aligned structures (Figure 8) reveals a remarkable similarity in the overall tertiary fold of these two coat proteins. The two viruses, however, differ in the orientation of the subunits that form the pentamers and the hexamers with respect to the icosahedral axes. In sobemoviruses such as SBMV and SMV (Abad-Zapatero et al., 1980; Bhuvaneswari et al., 1995), the N-terminal arm shows partial ordering in C subunits. The arm bends sharply and interacts with b-B strands. Thus the disposition of the N terminus in the B and C subunits of tymo and sobemo viruses are on opposite edges of the rather similar BIDG strands of the b- jelly roll motif (Figure 8). Modelling the sobemo viral arm to resemble tymoviruses leads to severe short contact between the arm and helix aB and penetration of the arm into the loop joining strands E and F. In the A subunit of PhMV, the arm exhibits yet

another variation. Here, it extends away from the body of the A subunit and interacts closely with the B and C subunits (Figure 5). Tymoviruses have striking similarities to CCMV in external morphology (Canady et al., 1996). Both viruses display prominent protrusions at the icosahedral 5 and 3-fold axes. Despite this similarity in external appearance, the PhMV polypeptide shows larger differences from CCMV when compared to SMV (Table 3). Only 120 of the 150 residues comprising the b-barrel are structurally equivalent between CCMV and PhMV, with a RMS deviation Ê of 3.65 A between corresponding Ca atoms, which Ê is substantially larger than that of SMV (2.65 A).

Discussion
Physalis mottle virus belongs to the tymovirus group of isometric plant viruses. A comparison of the tymoviral coat protein sequences (Figure 6 and Ranjith-Kumar et al., 1998) shows that these do not form a hierarchial cluster. Although PhMV and TYMV are both tymoviruses, they share only 32 % amino acid identity. Therefore, the close similarity

between the polypeptide folds observed in their coat proteins is surprising. At 32 % sequence identity, usually a number of deletions and insertions are anticipated between homologous proteins. However, the only insertion/deletion in the coat protein sequences of PhMV and TYMV are con®ned to the N and C-terminal ends. The C terminus in PhMV is shorter by two residues when compared to TYMV. The C-terminal deletion mutants of the PhMV CP were insoluble (Sastri et al.,1997). Recently, it has been shown that deletion of even a single residue at the C terminus leads to instability of the assembled capsids and disassembly (see the accompanying paper). The Cterminal residue is involved in a large number of intra-molecular interactions (data not shown).

Therefore, it is not surprising that deletion of even a single residue at this end results in capsid instability. This part of the polypeptide is conformationally distinct from that of TYMV. PhMV has the shortest C terminus when compared to other tymoviral sequences. As observed in TYMV (Canady et al., 1996), the N-terminal arms of the B and C subunits interact near the quasi-6-fold axis. The N terminus is not particularly well conserved between the two viruses despite this interesting similarity in their interactions. The interactions of the arm with the neighboring quasi-6-fold related subunit predominantly involve main-chain atoms from the N-terminal arm and from the loops close to the quasi-6fold (residues 114 and 129-131) and hence these

930 residues are probably not under evolutionary constraint. The N-terminal arms in the A subunits of PhMV are in a conformation different from those of B and C subunits. In the latter two subunits, the N terminus wraps around the subunit and assumes the bconformation, forming hydrogen bonds with b-G. In contrast, the arm in the A subunit has a very different conformation at residue 25 and extends towards the center of a quasi-trimer. The residues that are very different in conformation between A and B/C subunits are Asn25 and Thr26 (Figure 5(b)). Immunological examination of intact virus particles using monoclonal antibodies has suggested that the region around residue 22-26 is accessible (Kekuda et al., 1993; Sastri et al., 1997). However, in the structure, this region is completely buried. It is likely that this region is considerably mobile in solution and might get transiently exposed. This assumption is strengthened by the observation that the corresponding region in the TYMV A subunit is disordered. Also, the B and C subunit N-terminal arms show signi®cant conformational differences (Figure 4(a) to (c). The observed mobility might be due to the inherent ¯exibility of this region. Such structural dynamics have been reported for poliovirus (Li et al., 1994; Fricks & Hogle, 1990). The observations on the structures of PhMV and TYMV are interesting from the point of view of the ready formation of empty protein shells under a variety of conditions. Freezing and thawing, alkaline pH, and chemical denaturants lead to release of RNA and the formation of empty protein shells (Hirth & Givord, 1988). From neutron scattering measurements (Katouzian-Safadi & BerthetColominas, 1983; Witz & Kruse, 1983; Witz et al., 1993), it has been demonstrated that a pentamer is released from the capsid along with the RNA. In both PhMV and TYMV, the interactions holding the pentameric capsomeres are fewer than those stabilizing the hexameric capsomeres. Also, comparison of the inter-subunit contacts in PhMV with those of TYMV (Table 2) reveals that the number of contacts linking the subunits within a pentamer and the contacts linking pentamer and hexamer are signi®cantly fewer in PhMV. On the contrary, the number of contacts contributing to the stability of hexameric capsomeres are comparable. This makes release of a pentameric capsomere easier in PhMV when compared to TYMV. PhMV capsids are more sensitive to alkaline pH than TYMV capsids (TYMV; Savithri et al., 1987; Katouzian-Safadi et al., 1980). This higher susceptibility is also due to the fact that polyamines are more easily exchanged with other monovalent and divalent cations in PhMV when compared to TYMV (Savithri et al., 1987). These observations are consistent with the strengths of inter-subunit interactions in these two viruses. It is likely that the N-terminal segment of A subunits plays a crucial role in the disassembly of

Structure of Physalis Mottle Virus

PhMV. The segment clearly can assume alternative conformations, one in which speci®c interactions with other subunits are established, while in the other it is essentially disordered. This ¯exibility might be crucial both for the removal of a pentameric cap (®rst step of disassembly) and for the addition of a cap to a partially assembled particle (last step of assembly). The stability of the partially assembled capsids might be mediated by the interaction of the N-terminal arms of the B and C subunits near the quasi-6-fold axes and the dimeric interaction between the C subunits at the icosahedral 2-fold axes. Initially, diffusion processes might lead to the insertion of the A subunit arms into the cavity at the 5-fold axis of a pre-assembled hexameric capsomere. The ¯exibility of the arm will allow it to probe the half-formed structure. Once speci®c interactions (Figure 5) are established with the B and C subunits, the pentamer could ®ll the cavity, thus capping the capsid and completing the assembly. The mechanism envisaged here would suggest that the N-terminal arm is crucial for the controlled assembly and disassembly of the virus particles. However, studies on CP deletion mutants have demonstrated that recombinant capsids resembling T  3 particles are easily formed even when some 26 residues are removed from the N terminus (Sastri et al., 1997, 1999). Further, the 26 residue deletion mutant capsid was found to be more stable than the native particles. The structure of the recombinant capsids, now in progress, might provide further insights into the mechanism of assembly. Tymoviral coat protein sequences do not exhibit signi®cant similarities to those of sobemoviruses. In spite of this, the polypeptide folds of these two distinct classes of viruses show surprising similarities. Despite the close similarity in their external morphologies, CCMV and PhMV/TYMV coat protein tertiary structures show large differences. For the degree of sequence identity between tymo and sobemoviruses, the number of gaps observed are small and are con®ned to the loop regions connecting strands of the barrel. As Murzin (1998) has noted, divergent evolution is likely to result in similarities in certain details of structural organization that are not anticipated if similarity results from convergent evolution. For example, the structurally similar break in the strand b-G and the placement of helical segments in structurally equivalent loops in both SMV and PhMV (Table 3 and Figure 8) are not easily accounted for by convergent evolution. These observations suggest that the tymo and sobemo viruses are probably related by divergent evolution. If this assessment is right, it demonstrates that the relative position and orientation of capsid protein subunits could undergo substantial alterations in the course of viral evolution and the organization of the ¯exible arm could have substantial differences in homologous viral capsids.

function of resolution between PhMV observed and computed amplitudes. The agreement shows that the structure of TYMV is suitable for the initial phasing of the PhMV data, although the amino acid sequence identity between the coat protein sequences of these two viruses is only 32 %. The polyalanine models of the three icosahedrally independent subunits were subjected to crystallographic È re®nement using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992). Data between Ê 10 and 3.8 A were used for re®nement. The initial Rfactor of 46.5 % dropped to 42 % after 20 cycles of rigid body re®nement with strict icosahedral constraints. A 2Fo À Fc Fourier calculated at this stage revealed density for only a few side-chains. These side-chains were built using the interactive graphics program O (Jones et al., 1991) and included in further cycles of X-PLOR re®nement. The next 2Fo À Fc map revealed density only for a few additional residues. Subsequent cycles of re®nement did not result in the appearance of signi®cant density for a large fraction of the side-chains. Molecular replacement computations Attempts were made to re®ne the phases by direct space electron-density averaging. Initially, shells of different inner and outer radii were used to represent the viral protein envelope. Although TYMV protein starts Ê only at 104 A, it was found that the ®gures of merit, viz. R-factor and correlation coef®cient between observed and computed structure factor amplitudes, were better if Ê the region 90-104 A was included in the averaging, suggesting that the RNA or some other region in PhMV Ê is ordered at distances less than 104 A from the center of Ê the virus. Use of a radius greater than 147.5 A led to interpenetration of the particles related by crystal transÊ lation (R3 cell edge 295 A). TYMV particle exhibits prominent protrusions at the icosahedral 5-fold and 3-fold

Materials and Methods
Virus purification, crystallization and data collection PhMV was maintained on N. glutinosa plants in an insect-free glass house. The virus was puri®ed from infected leaves ten days after inoculation and crystallized Ê (space group R3, a  294.56 A, a 59.86  ) following previously established procedures. The methods used for the crystallization of the virus, X-ray diffraction data collection, processing and interpretation of rotation functions have been reported (Suryanarayana et al., 1989; Munshi et al., 1987; Hiremath et al., 1990). Structure determination Recently, the structure of TYMV has been determined (Canady et al., 1996). In order to examine the suitability of this virus structure as a starting model for the phase determination of PhMV, cross-rotation functions were computed in various resolution shells. The TYMV model was placed in the PhMV crystal cell such that the symmetry axes of the TYMV particle placed at the R3 cell origin aligned with the corresponding PhMV selfrotation function peaks. After creating an electron density based on the atomic positions, structure factors were computed using Agarwal's FFT procedure (Agarwal, 1978). Cross-rotation functions were computed using the resulting intensities. Figure 9 shows a typical crossrotation function obtained by rotating the TYMV Patterson about a 5-fold axis as determined by self-rotation function of PhMV. The quality of the cross-rotation function with signi®cant peaks (7s) separated by 72  shows that the TYMV coordinates provide a good approximation to the PhMV structure. A polayalanine model of TYMV was used for all further calculations. Table 1 records the R-factors and correlation coef®cients as a

Figure 9. Locked cross-rotation function between PhMV and TYMV. Intensity for TYMV was obtained by Fourier transformation of a polyalanine model of TYMV placed in PhMV R3 cell so as to align the particle symmetry elements along the corresponding directions of PhMV self-rotation function peaks. Rotation function was evaluated Ê as a function of rotation about a 5-fold axis. The radius of integration was 100 A.

axes, while there are deep valleys at the quasi-3-fold axes. In PhMV crystals, assuming that it will have a structure similar to TYMV, these 5-fold protrusions are oriented along the quasi-3-fold axis of a neighboring particle, thus accommodating the protrusions in the depression of a neighboring particle (Hiremath et al., 1990). Therefore, an outer radius that includes all the residues of the reference virus particle that also avoids overlap with neighboring particles could not be selected. Therefore, the limits of particle inner and outer radii Ê were selected as 90 and 140 A, respectively. The regions Ê beyond 140 A from the particle center that belongs to the protein coat were included in the averaging in terms of the volumes of the atoms of TYMV. These atoms of TYMV contributed to the envelope as spherical regions Ê of 3 A diameter at each atomic position. This ensured that most of the protein was included in the averaging procedure. Phase re®nement by electron density averaging and Ê solvent ¯attening was carried out to 3.8 A using a new computational procedure. In this procedure, grid positions in the coat protein envelope of the virus were associated with two values. The ®rst value, an integer number, represented the number of non-crystallographic equivalent points that have contributed to the electron density at the grid point at any stage of computation. The second number represented the sum of electron densities at these points. The grid coordinates, associated integer number and electron-density value were written as randomly accessible records of 1000 grid positions. At the start of the program, the electron-density value and the integer number associated with all grid positions were set to zero. The entire unaveraged map was read in many passes. The two numbers associated with grid points in the random access ®le were updated once for each pass. Starting from the ®rst electron-density map section, as many sections as could be accommodated in the core memory were read in each pass. For each grid position of the randomly accessible record, the electron densities at all points related by non-crystallographic symmetry that fell in the map sections in core were evaluated. The positions related by non-crystallographic symmetry are, in general, non-integral grid points. Electron densities at these positions were obtained by linear interpolation of values associated with the eight nearest integral grid positions. The electron density associated with the grid position was incremented by the sum of the interpolated electron-density values. The associated integer number was incremented by the number of contributing positions. At the end of the last pass that contained the terminal sections of the electron-density map in core, the integer number associated with all grid positions should be equal to the number of non-crystallographic symmetry (20 in this case) and the value equal to the sum of electron density of the related positions. An averaged map suitable for FFT back-transformation was constructed from the random access ®le. The initial R-factor for the TYMV polyalanine model Ê placed in the PhMV R3 cell was 48 % for the 5.5 A data. The molecular replacement calculations were initiated at Ê Ê 5.5 A resolution and extended in small steps to 3.8 A resolution. In each of these steps, initial phases for the re¯ections in the extended shell of reciprocal space were obtained from the atomic model of TYMV and were further re®ned by averaging. A total of 310 cycles of averaging was carried out. In the ®nal rounds of Ê averaging (3.8 A), the electron density was sampled at 480 and 240 grid points along the cell edge of the R3 crystal in the unaveraged and averaged maps,

Structure of Physalis Mottle Virus respectively. The overall R-factor and correlation coef®cient at the end of molecular replacement calculations were 30.5 % and 0.56, respectively. (R is de®ned as 100Æ(jFo À Fc j)/ÆFo and correlation coef®cient as Æ((Fo À hFoi)j(Fc À hFci)/(Æ(Fo À hFoi)2)(Æ(Fc À hFci)2)1/2). Also the overall phase change from the starting values Ê between the resolution limits of 10 and 3.8 A was 58  . The progress of density averaging is illustrated in Figure 10. The ®nal electron-density map was transformed to skew sections in a Cartesian cell with edges parallel with viral icosahedral 222 symmetry axes. Examination of the electron-density map and model building Polypeptide models for the A, B and C subunits of PhMV were built using the interactive graphics program O (Jones et al., 1991) into the averaged electron-density map. Initially, the polyalanine model of TYMV subjected to rigid body re®nement was displayed with the PhMV molecular replacement electron-density map and sidechains corresponding to PhMV sequence were added. These side-chains were adjusted for optimal ®tness to the electron density. The main chain also had to be adjusted for a few segments. The resulting atomic coordinates were re®ned initially by rigid body re®nement and then subjected to 250 cycles of positional re®nement È (Brunger, 1992). At all stages of re®nement, strict icosahedral symmetry was imposed. This ensured that there were suf®cient re¯ections for each parameter re®ned. È Rfree (Brunger, 1993, 1997) as a cross-validation index for structures of high non-crystallographic symmetry is of È doubtful signi®cance (Brunger, 1997; Had®eld et al., 1997). However, it is still likely to be a useful indicator,

However, throughout the re®nement, Rfree was within 1 % of the working set Rfactor. The X-PLOR re®nement statistics are shown in Table 1.
