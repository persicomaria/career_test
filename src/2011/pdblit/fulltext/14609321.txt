Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague, secretes a eukaryotic-like protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) termed Yersinia outer protein H (YopH) that is essential for virulence. We have determined, for the first time, the crystal structure of the YopH PTPase domain in complex with a nonhydrolyzable substrate analogue, the hexapeptide mimetic Ac-DADE-F2Pmp-L-NH2. As anticipated, the mode of ligand binding in the active site is similar to the way in which the corresponding phosphohexapeptide binds to the structurally homologous human PTP1B. Unexpectedly, however, the crystal structure also revealed a second substrate-binding site in YopH that is not present in PTP1B. The mode of binding and structural conformation of the hexapeptide analogue is quite different in the two sites. Although the biological function of the second substrate-binding site remains to be investigated, the structure of a substrate analogue in the active site of Y. pestis YopH opens the door for the structurebased design and optimization of therapeutic countermeasures to combat this potential agent of bioterrorism.

ABSTRACT:

Yersinia pestis utilizes a contact-dependent (type III) secretion apparatus to inject six cytotoxic effector proteins (YopE, YopH, YopM, YopJ/P, YopT, and YpkA) directly into the cytosol of mammalian cells, where they conspire to defeat the innate immune response of the infected organism by interfering with signaling pathways that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and inflammation (1-3). One of the effectors, YopH, is a powerful eukaryotic-like protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase). Upon translocation into mammalian cells, YopH disrupts signal transduction pathways required for the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix and phagocytosis by dephosphorylating a variety of proteins associated with the focal adhesion, including focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK), paxillin, p130cas, p105casL, Fyn-binding protein, and the Src-associated adaptor protein SKAP-HOM (4-9). Because its PTPase activity is essential for virulence (10), YopH is a valid molecular target for antiplague therapeutics that could be used to combat weaponized strains that have been engineered to be resistant to conventional antibiotics. YopH is a modular protein that is composed of two independently folded domains. The N-terminal domain (residues 1-130) binds tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in a phosphoryl-dependent manner and evidently plays a role in the recognition of at least some substrates in vivo (5, 11).

structure of the N-terminal domain of YopH (12, 13) does not resemble those of the eukaryotic Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, nor does it bind phosphotyrosine in a similar manner (14). The C-terminal domain of YopH (residues 164-468) is the seat of its PTPase activity (15). The structure of the Yersinia YopH PTPase domain is very similar to the structures of eukaryotic PTPases (16), suggesting that it may have been acquired by lateral gene transfer. The X-ray crystal structure of the catalytic domain of YopH was among the first PTPase structures to be solved (17). Phosphate-, tungstate-, nitrate-, and vanadate-bound structures were subsequently determined (17-20). Although these structures provided valuable information about enzymeanion interactions and the reaction mechanism, they did not reveal how YopH recognizes its phosphotyrosyl substrates. Such information is required for the structure-based design of more potent and specific inhibitors of the Yersinia PTPase. In this report, we describe the structure of the catalytic domain of YopH in complex with a hexapeptide mimetic (Ac-DADE-F2Pmp-L-NH2) derived from an autophosphorylation site of the epidermal growth factor receptor cytoplasmic domain. MATERIALS AND METHODS Synthesis of the Phosphotyrosyl Mimetic-Containing Hexapeptide. The nonhydrolyzable substrate analogue AcDADE-F2Pmp-L-NH2 was first reported as a high affinity inhibitor of PTP1B (21). The peptide employed in the present

13114 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 45, 2003 study was synthesized by using the F2Pmp1 residue as its free phosphonic acid, according to a modification of the procedure described by Gordeev (22). This involved introduction of the F2Pmp residue using BOP, DIEA, HOBt, and DMAP. Subsequent residues were added in the same fashion. The finished product was cleaved from the resin and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Protein Expression and Purification. The PTPase domain of YopH (residues 164-468) was overproduced in Escherichia coli as described (15). The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.7), 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (buffer A), and then disrupted with an APV Gaulin model G1000 homogenizer at 10 000 psi for three passes. After centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was applied to a carboxymethyl (CM) Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed extensively with buffer A, after which the bound protein was eluted with a gradient of 0.050.5 M NaCl in buffer A. The peak fractions containing YopH were subsequently run on a Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column equilibrated with 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.7), 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. The S-100 fractions containing pure YopH PTPase were pooled and concentrated by diafiltration to 10.3 mg/mL in 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.7), 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. Crystallization and Data Collection. The protein-ligand complex was prepared by adding a 10-fold molar excess of the substrate analogue to a concentrated solution of YopH PTPase (10.3 mg/mL). The first crystals were grown by the hanging drop, vapor-phase diffusion method at 18 °C by mixing 2 µL of the protein-ligand complex with 2 µL of a precipitant solution consisting of 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 20% (w/v) PEG 4000, and 10% (v/v) 2-propanol. The crystals initially grew in clusters that were not suitable for X-ray diffraction. However, a nice looking rod was dissected from the bunch and crushed for microseeding. The concentrated seed solution (10 µL) was diluted 200-fold, and then 0.5 µL was added to drops that had been preequilibrated for 3-8 h. The composition of these drops was either the same as the original conditions from which the seed source was obtained; 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 20% PEG 3350, and 200 mM NaCl; or 100 mM Bicine (pH 9.0), 20% PEG 4000, and 5% 2-propanol. Single, rod-shaped crystals measuring approximately 0.05 × 0.06 × 0.20 mm were observed after a few days. During the optimization process, it was found that this crystal form could also be obtained from a solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 18% PEG 8000, 200 mM NaF, and 5-15% (v/v) dioxane. In any scenario, a single prismatic rod was immersed in either 20% PEG 4000 and 15% (w/v) glycerol or 20% PEG 8000 and 15% glycerol, and then flash-frozen at 100 K for data collection at the SER-CAT insertion device beamline (22-ID, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory). The data were reduced using the HKL2000 suite of programs (23). The protein-ligand complex crystallized in the P1 space group as a dimer in the unit cell with specific

Structure Determination and Refinement. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the AMoRe program (25) using the coordinates of unliganded YopH PTPase (PDB code: 1YPT) as the search model. Two solutions were found after rigid body fitting with a correlation factor of 72.6 and R-factor of 31.8, corresponding to two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 1). The dimer model was refined with CNS (26), using maximum likelihood targets and noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints. Analysis and manual correction of the structure were carried out with the graphics program O (27). A summary of the crystallographic and refinement statistics is presented in Table 1. Strong and continuous electron density was observed for amino acids 168-468 of YopH. An Fo-Fc simulated annealing OMIT map revealed stretches of density corresponding to the structure of the substrate analogue in the active site and also in a second binding site on the opposite side of the protein.

No electron density corresponding to the Nterminal acetyl group of the ligand was observed in either binding site. RESULTS Cocrystallization of the YopH PTPase Domain with a Substrate Analogue. Using site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification to analyze the contributions of each amino acid surrounding an autophosphorylation site of an epidermal growth factor receptor-derived sequence (DADEpYLIPQQG) to substrate binding and catalysis, Zhang and co-workers concluded that the hexapeptide DADEpYL is the smallest derivative of this sequence that is still an efficient substrate for YopH (28, 29). It was also shown that the nonhydrolyzable phosphotyrosine mimetic phosphonomethylphenylalanine (Pmp) could be incorporated into the hexapeptide without distorting the geometry of the substrate, but the Pmp-containing peptide binds with reduced affinity because the methylene carbon atom cannot make the hydrogen bonds that are normally formed by the tyrosyl oxygen (30). Accordingly, the addition of two fluorine atoms to the methylene carbon of the Pmp moiety enhanced the potency of the hexapeptide inhibitor (21). Although the epidermal growth factor receptor is not known to be one of the natural targets of YopH in vivo, its autophosphorylation site is unquestionably the best-characterized substrate in vitro. Additionally, the DADE-pY-L-NH2 hexapeptide had previously been cocrystallized with a catalytically inactive mutant of human PTP1B (31). For these reasons, a nonhydrolyzable analogue of this hexapeptide (Ac-DADE-F2Pmp-L-NH2) was prepared and cocrystallized with the PTPase domain of YopH. Mode of Ligand Binding in the ActiVe Site. The substrate analogue Ac-DADE-F2Pmp-L-NH2 binds to the active-site

pocket of YopH in a manner that is very similar to the way in which the corresponding phosphohexapeptide binds to the catalytically inactive human PTP1B C215S mutant (31). The phosphotyrosyl mimetic is inserted into a 10 Å long crevice that is capped by a loop at the end of strand 8 (nomenclature as defined in ref 17) and the first turn of helix R5, which has been termed the phosphate-binding loop or P-loop (Figures 3 and 4A). This highly conserved structural motif is shared by nearly all PTPases and characterized by the sequence (H/V)CX5R(S/T) (32-34). The phosphate moiety is surrounded by the main chain amide groups of the P-loop

(residues 404-409), which donate six hydrogen bonds, the side chain of Arg409, which forms two salt bridges with the phosphate oxygen atoms, and a structural water molecule, Wat138, that is hydrogen-bonded to oxygen O2P (Table 2). At the center of the P-loop lies the catalytic cysteine, Cys403, whose thiolate group is located 4.2 Å from the phosphorus atom. A highly flexible loop (residues 350-360) containing the invariant Trp-Pro-Asp (WPD) triplet (35) is in the closed conformation, effectively sealing the ligand in the active site. The aromatic part of the pTyr mimetic is nestled in an aliphatic corridor created by invariant hydrophobic amino acids that line the crevice just outside the P-loop. The leucine in the +1 position of the hexapeptide rests in a shallow cleft formed by residues Ile232, Ile443, Gln446, Asp231, and Arg205 of YopH, and the edge of the phosphotyrosine analogue. The carboxyl side chain of Asp231 forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone amide groups at the F2Pmp and +1 positions of the hexapeptide. The acidic residues in the -1 and -2 positions of the substrate analogue are stabilized by ionic interactions with the guanidino group of Arg230, whereas the residues in the -3 and -4 positions protrude into the solvent and are disordered in the structure.

This mode of substrate binding in the active site of YopH is consistent with the observation that deleting residues -3 and -4 from the DADEpYL hexapeptide had only a modest effect (5-fold reduction) on catalytic efficiency (28). Conformational Changes Induced by Ligand Binding. The structure of the apoenzyme (PDB code: 1YPT) aligns very closely with that of the enzyme-hexapeptide complex, with an overall CR RMSD of only 0.6 Å for all residues except amino acids 350-360 (Figure 3B). The latter residues correspond to the flexible WPD loop with the general acid/ base Asp356 that swings into the active site to participate in substrate sequestering and catalysis (18, 36). The carboxyl side chain of Asp356, which is equivalent to Asp92 in Vaccinia H1-related phosphatase (VHR) and Asp181 in PTP1B, acts as a general acid to donate a proton to the leaving tyrosyl hydroxyl group, generating the phosphoenzyme intermediate. In the second step of the reaction, where the cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate is hydrolyzed, kinetic data for the VHR D92N mutant suggested that the conserved aspartic acid behaves as a general base to activate a nearby water molecule for nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus (18). Upon binding of the nonhydrolyzable substrate ana-

Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 45, 2003 13117 Comparison with Anion-Bound Structures. The structure of the YopH PTPase/substrate analogue complex can be aligned with the structures of the enzyme-nitrate, -tungstate (20), and -sulfate (19) complexes with an average RMSD of only 0.4 Å for all CR atoms. Their flexible WPD loops are all in the "closed" conformation, poised for catalysis. The side chains that need to rotate to accommodate the new loop position also adopt similar conformations in all of these structures. Movement of the R3 helix (residues 286-297) relative to the unliganded structure is also observed in the anion-bound enzymes, but to a lesser extent. The carboxylate group of Asp231 has a similar conformation in the tungstateand hexapeptide-bound structures, whereas in the two other anion-bound structures its conformation corresponds to that observed in the apoenzyme. This implies that both rotamers probably exist in solution because neither interacts with the ligands in any of these structures. The ligand-binding side chain of Arg230 adopts quite different conformations in all four structures, with the greatest difference occurring in the structure of the enzyme-hexapeptide complex. The side chains of Gln446 and Asp356 have different orientations in the hexapeptide complex because of the presence of the fluorine atoms in the phosphotyrosine mimetic. In all four structures, Arg205 adopts a conformation that permits hydrogen bonding with the backbone carbonyl of Gln446, which does not occur in ligand-free enzyme. Finally, the tungstate ion is almost superimposable with the phosphoryl moiety of the phosphotyrosine mimetic. Its apical oxygen (O4) coincides with the methylene carbon, while the sulfate ion extends 0.6 Å further into the P-loop of the C403S mutant. The dissimilarity can be explained by the chemistry of the C403S substitution (19). Comparison with the Human PTP1B/Ac-DADEpYL-NH2 Complex. Although YopH and human PTP1B share only 20% sequence identity in the catalytic domain (35), their three-dimensional structures are remarkably similar (17, 37). When the P-loop and WPD-loop from the PTP1B/ Ac-DADE-pY-L-NH2 complex (PDB code: 1PTU) are aligned with their counterparts in the YopH/Ac-DADEF2Pmp-L-NH2 structure, the overall CR RMSD is only 0.350 Å. The phosphoryl moiety in both complexes is similarly positioned in its respective phosphate-binding loop. Inevitably, however, there are a number of differences between the two structures because their amino acid sequences are so dissimilar. In the YopH complex, Gln357 interacts with the pro-R fluorine (Figure 3C), while the corresponding Phe182 in PTP1B forms part of the binding site for the phenyl ring of phosphotyrosine. Phe182 pushes Gln262 away from the phosphate group such that it now lines the pocket for the phosphotyrosine phenyl group. The corresponding residue in YopH is Gln446, which also moves to create the binding site for the F2Pmp moiety, but instead of rotating away from the phosphate headgroup, it turns upward to form hydrogen bonds with the pro-S fluorine (Figure 3C). In the PTP1B/TPI complex (PDB code: 1BZC), which also contains the F2Pmp moiety, Gln262 adopts the same rotamer as in the PTP1B/hexapeptide structure and does not interact with the fluorine atom (38). Nonetheless, unlike its counterpart in the PTP1B/hexapeptide complex, Asp181 in the PTP1B/TPI complex rotates away from the F2Pmp moiety in much the same way as Asp356 does in the structure of the YopH/hexapeptide complex.

logue to YopH, Asp356, and Gln357 move 6.3 and 7 Å closer to the active site, respectively. However, the side chain of Asp356 rotates away from the ligand due to the presence of the fluorine atoms on carbon CH of the F2Pmp moiety (Figure 3C). In addition, the guanidino group of Arg205 moves 4 Å to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of Gln446, which also shifts its position to create part of the binding site for the phenyl moiety of the pTyr mimetic.

Description of the Second Substrate-Binding Site. The second, noncatalytic substrate binding site is located in a long, shallow groove alongside helix R4 and the 6/ 7 hairpin, on the opposite side of the molecule from the active site (Figure 4B). Structural alignment of the F2Pmp moieties demonstrates that the ligands adopt very different conformations in the two binding sites (Figure 5). In the noncatalytic binding site, the phosphoryl moiety forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Ser388, Ser389, and the backbone amide group of Ser389 (Figure 6). A bidentate salt bridge is formed between the guanidinium ion of Arg278 and phosphate oxygens O1P and O3P. The fluorine atom FH is 3.36 Å from atom NZ of Lys342 (Table 2). The major interaction with the difluoro moiety is contributed by Arg295 from a crystallographic symmetry mate of the same subunit type,

such as B-B or A-A (Arg295). The plane of the Arg295 guanidino group is perpendicular to the plane formed by the methylene carbon and the fluorine atoms. The pro-R fluorine FH is hydrogen-bonded to atom NE of Arg295 (3.13 Å), and the pro-S fluorine FH2 makes hydrogen bonds with atoms NH1 and NH2 at 3.33 and 3.37 Å, respectively. Arg295 also forms a bidentate salt bridge with the carboxyl side chain of the glutamic acid at position -1 in the hexapeptide (Glu604), and hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygens of Lys386 and Gly387. The phenyl ring of the F2Pmp is packed against the side chain of Tyr383 and the aliphatic portions of Lys386 and Glu604, where it also makes hydrophobic contacts with Lys342, Ile344, and Met382. The leucine at position +1 in the substrate analogue (Leu606) engages in hydrophobic interactions with the CG2

Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 45, 2003 13119 cells (40, 41). Nevertheless, YopH clearly exercises some degree of substrate selectivity because it preferentially targets certain proteins associated with the focal adhesion (e.g., p130Cas, paxillin, and FAK). All of these proteins contain multiple phosphorylation sites in a variety of sequence contexts and in no case is it known precisely which phosphates are removed by YopH. Circumstantial evidence suggests that YopH may favor sequences of the general form pY-Xaa-Xaa-P (6, 29), but thus far there has been no experimental confirmation of this conjecture. The lack of specific information about the sites that are dephosphorylated by YopH in its "natural" targets discouraged us from attempting to cocrystallize the enzyme with substrate analogues derived from these proteins. The phosphotyrosine-containing peptide DADE-pYLIPQQG, which corresponds to an autophosphorylation site (Tyr992) in the epidermal growth factor receptor, is by far the best characterized and most efficient substrate reported for YopH, with a rate constant (2.23 × 107 M-1 s-1) that is near the diffusion-controlled limit (28). A systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships within this phosphopeptide revealed that the hexapeptide derivative DADE-pY-L is dephosphorylated with nearly equal efficiency (28). It therefore seemed plausible that the structure of YopH in complex with a nonhydrolyzable form of this hexapeptide would afford a suitable starting point for the structure-based design and optimization of more potent and specific YopH inhibitors. Accordingly, the difluorophosphonomethylphenylalanine derivative Ac-DADE-F2Pmp-L-NH2 was prepared for cocrystallization with the enzyme. The mode of ligand binding in the active site of YopH is generally consistent with the results of structure-activity studies conducted by Zhang and co-workers (28, 29). The residues in the -3 and -4 positions of the substrate analogue protrude into the solvent in the cocrystal structure and do not make contact with the enzyme. Removing them from the hexapeptide reduces catalytic efficiency only 5-fold (28). The acidic residues in the -1 and -2 positions of the substrate analogue are stabilized by ionic interactions with the guanidino group of Arg230. Accordingly, removing these residues or replacing them with alanine results in more dramatic effects on catalytic efficiency (28, 29). The Glu at position -1 appears to be especially critical; an otherwise identical hexapeptide with alanine in this position is a 126-fold less efficient substrate for YopH (28). There are strong hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions between the side chain of Asp231 and the main chain amides of the F2Pmp moiety and the leucine residue at position +1 in the hexapeptide. Yet, the side chain of the C-terminal leucine residue makes very few favorable contacts with the protein. These observations are consistent with the finding that deleting residues C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine has more severe consequences than replacing them with alanine (28, 29). Potential Function of the Noncatalytic Substrate Binding Site. The activity of many PTPases is regulated not only by the sequence context in which the phosphotyrosine residue resides, but also by subcellular localization and accessory modules that participate in substrate recognition (42). Such is the case for YopH. Persson and co-workers determined that the surface loop sequence 223-226 functions in localizing YopH to peripheral focal complexes (43). Moreover,

atoms of Thr335 and Thr343. The side chain of Glu604 is hydrogen-bonded to that of Lys342, and its main chain carbonyl oxygen accepts a proton from Lys386 NZ. The carboxyl side chain of the aspartic acid in position -2 of the hexapeptide (Asp603) forms hydrogen bonds with the OH and NH1 groups of Thr343 and Arg337, respectively. The residues at positions -4 (Asp601) and -3 (Ala602) of the hexapeptide do not interact directly with the protein. Instead, they make intrapeptide interactions with the side chain of Asp601 hydrogen bonding to backbone amides of Asp603 and Ala602. In another intrapeptide interaction, hydrogen bonds are accepted by the side chain of Asp603 from the main chain amide groups of F2Pmp (FPY605) and Leu606. Interestingly, Asp603 effectively mimics the function of the enzyme's Asp231, which forms similar hydrogen bonds with the substrate analogue in the active site (Figure 3A). In the structure of human PTP1B/Ac-DADE-pY-L-NH2 complex, the corresponding Asp48 also stabilizes the backbone conformation through the same hydrogen-bonding pattern (32). DISCUSSION Structural Insights into Substrate Specificity. Kinetic studies with many different types of substrates have shown that the PTPase domain of YopH is not a highly selective enzyme (28, 29, 39). Indeed, given sufficient time, YopH will dephosphorylate a wide range of proteins in eukaryotic

13120 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 45, 2003 together with the C-terminal catalytic domain, the N-terminal domain of YopH plays a role in substrate recognition by independently binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated sites (5, 11). In principle, either or both of these factors could contribute to the specificity of YopH in vivo. Yet, whereas deleting the N-terminal domain of YopH or abolishing its ability to bind phosphotyrosyl peptides by site-directed mutagenesis reduced the rate of substrate dephosphorylation in vivo, it did not diminish the intrinsic specificity of the PTPase domain (5). It therefore seems likely that the role of the N-terminal substrate-binding domain is to anchor the enzyme to the target so that its catalytic machinery can operate processively on multiple phosphotyrosines. A similar phenomenon had been observed for the two-headed ATPhydrolyzing motor protein that progresses along the length of its target in "end over end" mechanical steps (44). The fact that the known targets of YopH possess multiple phosphorylation sites in tandem is consistent with this hypothesis. The unexpected discovery of a second substrate-binding site in the catalytic domain of YopH raises the possibility that it too may contribute to the processive action of the enzyme in vivo. It is interesting that there seem to be more specific interactions between the protein and ligand in the second site than the active site, especially outside of the F2Pmp moiety. Unlike the way in which phosphopeptides adhere to a shallow groove on the surface of the N-terminal domain of YopH (14), the second substrate analogue in the structure described here binds in a very well-defined cleft (Figure 4B). Further work will be required to determine whether this binding site contributes to the activity of YopH in vivo, and if so, what its specificity is. Prospects for the DeVelopment of YopH Inhibitors. The presence of multiple phosphotyrosine binding sites in YopH has the potential to complicate the development of inhibitors for this enzyme. Yet, because there is no direct way to measure the binding of inhibitors to these auxiliary sites, the active site of the enzyme remains the most practical target. The structure of the YopH PTPase domain in complex with a hexapeptide mimetic represents an important first step in this direction. The cocrystal structure suggests that the tetrapeptide analogue DE-F2Pmp-L-NH2, which encompasses the bulk of the interactions with the enzyme active site, would be a good starting point for further optimization. The side chain of the C-terminal leucine residue appears to be a particularly good prospect for modification because it projects into but does not make optimal contacts with the body of the enzyme. The crystal structure of the YopH/hexapeptide complex also suggests additional ways in which the inhibitor could be modified to take advantage of adjacent hydrophobic and polar pockets on the surface of the protein. The challenges that lie ahead are formidable. As in any drug development project, specificity, toxicity, and bioavailability are major concerns. Yet, the specter of antibioticresistant plague, unleashed by terrorists or rogue nations, demands immediate attention and YopH is presently the most promising target for the development of antivirulence drugs. A noteworthy advantage of drugs that directly target essential virulence factors such as YopH is that it would probably be very difficult to engineer organisms that are resistant to antivirulence agents but that can still cause disease. With the structure of YopH in complex with a nonhydrolyzable

Phan et al. substrate analogue now in hand, we are potentially one step closer to the eradication of this deadly bioterrorist threat. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors wish to thank Dr. Zhong-Yin Zhang for his gift of the YopH PTPase expression vector. REFERENCES
