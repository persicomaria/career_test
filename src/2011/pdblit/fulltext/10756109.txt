Abstract
An immunosuppressive agent, cyclosporin A (CsA), has antimalarial activity in several Plasmodium species. Cyclophilins of several species including Plasmodium fulcipurum exhibit peptidyl-prolyl cis-frans isomerase activity which is inhibited by CsA. A gene encoding P. falciparum cyclophilin (PFCyP) was cloned and characterized. This gene has the entire coding sequence for the mature protein plus a 39-amino-acid-long N-terminal extension. Most of the amino acids predicted to be involved in the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity and CsA binding are present in the cloned gene. The PFCyP also has the single highly conserved tryptophan residue that is a major determinant in the inhibition of PPIase activity by CsA. The PFCyP coding sequence with or without the N-terminal amino-acid extension was used to construct recombinant expression vectors which were transformed into E. coli. Both vectors produced enzymatically active mature PFCyP proteins that were sensitive to CsA. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from the synchronized parasite cultures verified the expression of PFCyP in all erythrocytic stages of the parasite, but at variable levels. The highest level of expression was observed in ring-stage parasites, a stage shown to be more susceptible to CsA. Inhibition of P. fulciparum growth in vitro by CsA was re-evaluated for chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of the parasite. Essentially, there was no difference between the two strains for the concentration of CsA required to yield 50% inhibition in 48 h of exposure (0.25-0.4 PM).

lion people are infected worldwide by these parasites and about 1.5 million die each year [1,2]. Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the majority of these deaths. The Plasmodium species are increasingly resistant to the most common antimalarial drug, chloroquine [2,3]. As a result, new drugs must be synthesized in order to combat this disease. Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive drug (for review, see Ref. 41, binds to cyclophilins (EC. 5.2.1.8) from several species [5]. Cyclophilin catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of an Xaa-proline peptide bonds and accelerates the rate-limiting steps

in the refolding of several proteins in vivo [6-lo]. Hence, it is also called peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase or rotamase). The PPIase activity of many eukaryotic cyclophilins is strongly inhibited by CsA [ll]. Since CsA is known to suppress the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in many mammalian species, it is expected that this drug would enhance the susceptibility to infections by Plasmodium species. In contrast, CsA acts as a potent inhibitor for the growth of rodent malaria parasites (P. berghei, P. chabaudi and P. yoelii) in mice [12-151 and P. falciparum in vitro [13,16,17]. In addition, several non-immunosuppressive analogues and weak-immunosuppressive analogues of CsA have significant antimalarial activity against P. falciparum in vitro similar to CsA [16,18]. A possible target for CsA in malaria parasites is cyclophilin. Recently, Bell et. al. [18] presented evidence for the presence of cyclophilin PPIase activity in P. falcipar-urn that is inhibited by CsA and its analogues [18]. Detailed knowledge about the parasite cyclophilins will enable us to determine their involvement in the CsA inhibition. In addition, the information will be valuable for the design of potent inhibitors against malaria. In this article, cloning, sequence analysis and expression of a P. falciparum cyclophilin gene is described. The RNA from synchronized blood stage parasites cultured in vitro is also analyzed in order to determine the stage specific expression of the cloned gene. In addition, inhibition of P. falciparum growth in vitro by CsA is re-examined for chloroquine-resistant and -sensitive parasite strains.

lated by the SDS-proteinase K method [21]. Total RNA was isolated from mixed cultures by the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction procedure [22]. 2.2. DNA sequencing The nucleotide sequence was determined for both DNA strands by performing dideoxy chain-termination reactions [23]. Primers used for sequencing include T3, T7 promoter primers, and two internal primers: MGPl (S-TCCACCTTGAATCATAAAATCITITA'ITACCC-3') and MGP2 (S-AAACATGATAAAGAAGGACGTATGGC-3'). Location of these primers in Fig. 1 is from nt 477 to 446 of the - strand and 553 to 585 of the + strand, respectively. 2.3. Analysis of nucleic acids Restriction-enzyme-digested genomic DNA and total RNA were resolved on agarose gels and transferred onto nylon membranes essentially as described [24]. DNA filter hybridizations were performed at 65°C 1201, and were washed once at room temperature in the presence of 6 X SSC (1 X SSC is 150 mM NaCl/lS mM Na, . citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.5% SDS for 10 min, followed by two washes at 52°C for 30 min in buffer containing 2 X SSC/O.l% SDS. The final stringent wash was performed at 52°C for 30 min in the presence of 0.1 X SSC and 0.1% SDS. Low-stringency hybridization was performed under the above conditions, but at 50°C. This filter was washed essentially as above for the first three washes, except that the second and third washes were performed at 50°C. The final wash was performed at 50°C in the presence of 1 X SSC/O.l% SDS for only 15 min. Hybridization and washing conditions for RNA filter hybridizations were the same as for the stringent hybridization to Southern blots. The 5' RACE (rapid amplification of c-DNA ends) was performed [25] to determine an additional sequence 5' to the genomic sequence determined from 0017M. Approx. 10 pg of total RNA was treated with 5 units of RQ DNAse I (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for 10 min at 37°C. At the end of incubation, RNA was phenol-extracted and

ethanol-precipitated. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from this DNA-free RNA after annealing with the oligonucleotide primer, MGPl (see above). At the 3' end of the first-strand synthesis, a dC tail was added using terminal transferase. Double-stranded cDNA was PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplified using a gene-specific primer and an oligo(dG) primer. In the absence of reverse transcriptase, no PCR product was generated (as judged by the hybridization with 0017M clone insert). Subsequently, PCR products were cloned into the EcoRV site of

the plasmid, Bluescript SK + . Several recombinant clones were selected for sequencing. 2.4. Expression of P. falciparum cyclophilin in E. coli Expression of P. falciparum cyclophilin (PFCyP) was performed in E. coli using the expression vector,pET9A (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) to obtain large quantities of protein [26]. The entire protein coding sequence of PFCyP, including the N-terminal

amino-acid extension sequence was amplified by PCR with 5' and 3' end specific primers from the genomic DNA (Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) was used to minimize the error rate of PCR). The primers were designed as follows: 5' primer 1; S-GAGGTACCATATGAAAAA TAATGATAATAAAAG-3' 3' primer; 5'-GAGCTCGGATCCTCATAATTCTCCGCATICTAC-3'. Unique restriction sites (WeI and BumHI) were designed in these primers for directional cloning into the vector. The underline sequence letters represent the sequence of PFCyP. To prepare a construct without the N-terminal amino-acid extension sequence, another primer (5' primer 2: 5'-GTCGGAATTCATATGAATCCTGTTGTATTTATG-3') was also designed to eliminate the first 39 amino acids but included the initiation codon at the 5' end to begin the expression. The recombinant constructs with (PET-PFCyPC) or without (PET-PFCyP.P) the signal sequence and a non-recombinant vector (pET9A) were transformed into the E. coil strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The bacteria were grown to a mid-log phase and the target protein expression was induced by the addition of IPTG (final concentration of 0.4 mM). Cells were harvested at 4 time points and crude extracts were prepared essentially as described in the PET system manual of Novagen. Soluble and insoluble extracts from these constructs were analyzed by 10% SDSPAGE. 2.5. Assay for PPIase activity of PFCyP PPIase activity of PFCyP was assayed in a Beckman DU series 650 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA, USA) essentially as described [7,27]. This assay measures the cis to trans isomerization of the alanine proline peptide bond in the synthetic peptide N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phepnitroanilide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). In a typical assay, 750 ~1 of assay mixture containing 50 mM HEPES buffer pH S.O/lOO mM NaCl/lOO PM synthetic peptide/ mg of a-chymotrypsin was equilibrated in a 1 ml cuvette for 2 min at 10°C (initially, the peptide will have the mixture of cis and trans isomers at equilibrium. The truns isomer of the peptide will be degraded immediately by cu-chymotrypsin since it is the substrate). The reac-

tion was then initiated by adding 15 ~1 of extract. The additional color developed due to cleavage of the newly formed trans isomer of the peptide was monitored by the change in the absorption at 395 nm [7,27]. In assays containing CsA (final concentration of 1 PM), the extract was pre-incubated for 2 min at 10°C and the reaction was initiated with (Ychymotrypsin and peptide. 2.6. Inhibition of the growth of P. falciparum by CsA CsA was dissolved in ethanol to give a concentration of 1 mg ml-' and was diluted further in the culture media to yield the desired drug concentration. 250 ~1 of non-synchronized culture, with a parasitemia in the approx. l-2% range, was used for inhibition experiments for 48 h by the micro-dilution technique [28]. Media containing CsA was replaced once after 24 h while maintaining the desired drug concentration. Inhibition of the uptake of a radiolabeled nucleic acid precursor, [ 3H]hypoxanthine (1 &i), for 4 h by the parasite served as the indicator for antimalarial activity [28]. Radiolabeled genomic DNA was extracted [29] and [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. Each experiment was performed at least twice.

cy-

Recently, we have reported sequence tags from 400 P. fulciparum (HB3 isolate) genomic DNA clones prepared by the `genease' activity of mung bean nuclease [20,30]. Clone 0017M is one among them that has significant homology to cyclophilins of several species, suggesting that it contains a coding sequence for a PFCyP protein [20]. In this study, the entire sequence of this clone from both strands was determined (Fig. 1). The 668-bp sequence of 0017M (sequence in capital letters in Fig. 1) has an open reading frame extending from nt 2 to 625 (208 amino acids long). In addition, it has 43 nt of sequence 3' to the coding sequence. The earliest in-frame ATG was found at nt 125 to 127 (corresponding to in-frame amino acid 421, but the homol-

ogy search using the BLAST server [31] to protein and translated GenBank databases indicated that the predicted 37th amino acid of this clone corresponds to the 2nd or 3rd amino acid of many cyclophilins (data not shown). These results suggested that the 0017M contains the complete coding sequence for the mature protein but lacks the initiation codon. The sequence 5' to the homologous region may encode for a signal peptide, a common feature of cyclophilins from organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum [32,33]. Alternatively, this sequence may represent an intron 5' to the coding sequence. This issue was resolved by determining the cDNA sequence which is described below. 3.2. RNA analysis The total RNA from mixed in vitro cultured parasites was analyzed by the 5' RACE method [25]

and by Northern blot analysis [24]. An additional sequence 5' to 0017M was determined from cDNA clones prepared by the 5' RACE method. Several cDNA clones were identified, all of which had additional sequence 5' to the genomic sequence (the longest being 164 nt; sequence in small letters in Fig. 1). An initiation codon, ATG was identified at 8 nt 5' to the 0017M sequence. Stop codons were found 5' to this ATG in all three forward frames. The data from cDNA and genomic clones defined the entire coding sequence for the PFCyP. The cDNA sequence was confirmed from the genomic DNA after PCR amplification and subsequent cloning and sequencing of the PCR product (Oligos MGPl and 5' oligol; 5'-ATATAATACTTTTTATCCTTTTA-3 (its location on the + strand is at nt 1 to 23 in Fig. 1) were used in the PCR). Results from genomic DNAPCR and subsequent sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the cDNA sequence and provided no

Lanes 1 to 5 represent RNA from schizonts, early rings, late rings, early trophs and late trophs respectively; whereas M represents RNA from mixed parasites. Hybridization signals were quantified on a phosphor imager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Filters were re-hybridized with P. berghei 32P-labeled ribosomal DNA insert [41] to measure the amount of ribosomal RNA (rRNA1 present in each lane. The quantity of the PFCyP transcript expressed was calculated relative to rRNA. This experiment was performed three times and the relative accumulation of the PFCyP transcript with error bars is presented.

evidence for the presence of introns at the 5' end of the gene. RNA filter hybridization analysis identified a 1.4kb-long transcript (not shown). This was almost twice the size of the predicted coding sequence. These results suggested that the transcript has approx. 0.6 kb of untranslated sequence. Transcripts of several genes from P. falciparum have unusually long untranslated sequences [34]. 3.3. Southern blot analysis Filter hybridization of P. falciparum (HB3) genomic DNA, digested to completion with DraI, EcoRI, EcoRV and SpeI, was performed using 0017M as the probe [24] (this probe does not contain sites for these enzymes). One hybridization signal was identified from each digest under stringent hybridization and washing conditions (Fig. 2A). Lowstringency hybridization was also performed which yielded additional very faint cross hybridizing signals (data not shown). These faint signals may represent heterologous gene copies. In Neurospora crassa, there is only one gene for cyclophilin [35], which is transcribed into two mRNAs with different 5' terminal sequences. One is the cytosolic mRNA without a signal sequence and the other is for the mitochondria with the N-terminal signal sequence. Although it is possible to have only one gene copy for cyclophilin in P. falciparum, similar to the situation in N. crassa, the results from the low-stringency hybridization experiment did not provide conclusive evidence for the number of copies present in the genome.

3.4. Variable expression of PFCyP transcript in the erythrocytic stages of the parasite PFCyP transcript levels were analyzed using synchronized cultures to determine the level of expression in various erythrocytic stages of the parasite. Synchronization of parasite growth was performed with sorbitol essentially as described in [36] and was assessed by counting parasites at various stages of development from a thin blood smear (Table 1). Total RNA isolated from 5 different time points was analyzed by RNA filter hybridization to quantitate the levels of expression of PFCyP. The quantity of the PFCyP transcript expressed was calculated relative to rRNA present in each lane. The results (Fig. 2B) indicated that the PFCyP is expressed at all of the 5 different time points of development, but at variable levels. The highest level of expression was observed in the late-ring stage parasites (in the late trophozoite stage, marked variation in the levels of the transcript was observed in the three experiments performed. However, despite these variations, the levels of expression was consistently lower than the late ring stage parasites). The variation in the levels of transcript at different stages may lead to altered levels of the protein synthesized (remains to be determined). In earlier reports, clearance of malaria parasites (P. yoelii and P. berghei) in mice treated with CsA was reported [13,14]. These studies indicated that the parasite's response to CsA is different in different stages (ring and schizont stages are cleared more rapidly than the trophozoite stage parasites). Assuming that cyclophilins of murine malaria

The P. fulciparum culture at 10% parasitemia (predominantly rings) was treated with 5% sorbitol at room temperature for 5 min [36]. Synchronization was monitored by analyzing thin blood smears. Approx. 1400-2000 RBC were counted to assess the stage of the parasite. The percent of total parasites present in each stage were calculated. At 0 h, cultures were in the early-ring stage. Each schizogonic cycle took 38 h for completion under culture conditions. Normal duration for the P. falciparum schizogonic cycle is between 36-48 h [43].

parasites are also expressed stage-specifically, and that their function is disrupted by CsA, then the observed variations in clearance of parasites could be explained due to the marked inhibition of cyclophilin function(s) by CsA. This needs to be established. 3.5. Multiple sequence alignment A multiple sequence alignment of PFCyP with three different human cyclophilins; cyclophilin A (CyP-A), cyclophilin B (CyP-B) and cyclophilin 3 (CyP-3) (GenBank accession Nos. X52851, M80254 and M60857, respectively) was performed to determine the similarities and differences between the host and parasite cyclophilins (localization of the

human cyclophilins; CyP-A, cytosol; CyP-B, endoplasmic reticulum; and CyP-3, membrane and/or organelles (the precise localization of the CyP-3 is not known, but it is homologous to rat mitochondrial CyP)). The alignments are presented in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 includes the consensus sequence below the multiple sequence alignment. At numerous positions, amino acids are conserved in PFCyP and in all of the three human cyclophilins. Most of the conserved amino acids are predicted to be involved in the PPIase activity and CsA binding [5]. The PFCyP has the single highly conserved tryptophan (W) residue at position 163 (shaded `W' with a # above it in Fig. 3), which corresponds to position 121 in human cyclophilin A [37].

The amino-acid sequence of PFCyP was aligned with the three human cyclophilins by using GCG programs PILEUP and PRETTY [42]. The amino acids in capital letters indicate that they are conserved in 3 or more sequences and they are also used at sites where conserved substitutions were observed. Consensus sequence is provided below the multiple alignment. The * above certain amino acids (the shaded amino acids) indicates that they are involved in CsA binding [5,38,39]. The shaded Tryptophan (W) (which is identified by # above it) refers to the sole amino acid critical for CsA inhibition [37].

human and E. coli cyclophilins define this residue as the major determinant in the inhibition of PPIase activity by CsA [37]. In addition, all the amino acids thought to be involved [38,39] in CsA binding are present in the translated sequence (shaded amino acids with a * above them in Fig. 3) with one exception. Histidine (H), a basic amino acid at position 126 in human CyP-A is a conserved amino acid [38,39] which is changed in PFCyP to asparagine (N), an uncharged polar amino acid (this amino acid is located at position 168). In addition, PFCyP protein sequence is expanded in two regions which adds 8 additional amino acids to this protein. The presence of all amino acids involved in CsA binding and PPIase inhibition in other known enzymes suggest that the PFCyP is a CsA binding protein. Because of these similarities, PFCyP may also be sensitive to CsA. These results support the data presented in the recent report by Bell et. al. [18], who demonstrated the presence of PPIase activity in P. falciparum that is inhibited by CsA [18]. It is possible that the observed differences in the primary structures of PFCyP and human cyclophilins may provide PFCyP with slightly altered functional properties in comparison to host cyclophilins. This remains to be established. The N-terminal amino-acid extension of the PFCyP showed no homology with the human cyclophilins. However, its position in the alignment suggests that it may represent a signal peptide similar to the human CyP-B and CyP-3 [32]. In addition, PFCyP appeared more similar to human CyP-B and CyP-3 than the CyP-A. These results may indicate that the cloned PFCyP encodes a parasite cyclophilin that is targeted to an organelle. 3.6, High-level expression of PFCyP gene product in E. coli usingpET9A vector Expression of PFCyP was performed in E. coti using the pET9A vector to obtain high levels of functional recombinant protein. Human CyP-B is expressed in. E. coli with the N-terminal signal sequence in an expression construct [32,33], which is processed by E. coli to yield mature recombinant protein that lacks the signal peptide 132,331. Although the human CyP-B is processed, the recovery of the functional protein is significantly higher for a

Lanes 1-4, 5-8 and 9-12 indicate four time points (0, 30, 90 and 180 min) after the induction. The lanes l-4 contained cell extracts prepared from the E. coli with non-recombinant pET9A vector, whereas the lanes 5-8 and 9-12 contained extracts from the E. cob having constructs, PET-PFCyP.C and PET-PFCyP.P, respectively. Data from the insoluble extracts are presented. High-level expression of the predicted proteins are distinct in 30, 90 and 180-min time points for constructs PET-PFCyP.C and PET-PFCyP.P (approx. 28 and approx. 22 kDa, respectively). Lanes 7 and 8 also have a protein band approx. 22 kDa that is simiIar to the expressed protein in lanes 10-12. Lane M refers to protein standards as molecular mass markers.

construct that does not contain the signal sequence [32]. Therefore, the N-terminal amino-acid extension of PFCyP was included in the expression construct (PET-PFCyP.C) to test for processing by E. coli, and a second construct (PET-PFCyP.P) was also prepared that lacked the N-terminal extension. Extracts prepared from E. coli containing these constructs and from a negative control (E. coli containing non-recombinant pET9A) were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Results from an insoluble fraction of the extract are presented in the Fig. 4. High-level expression of the predicted protein bands was observed in the extracts of the induced recombinant plasmids in E. coli (based on the theoretical analysis, the predicted masses of the expressed proteins for constructs PET-PFCyP.C and PET-PFCyP.P are 27.78 and 22.72 kDa, respectively). In contrast, no such proteins were observed for extracts obtained from E. coli having the non-recombinant pET9A plasmid. Extracts from the PET-PFCyP.C construct yielded one predominant band at approx. 28 kDa and

a second, faint band at approx. 22 kDa (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8) that was similar to the protein expressed in PET-PFCyP.P construct (lanes 10-12). No such protein band was observed in the control extracts (lanes l-4). This 22-kDa protein band may represent a processed mature protein without the N-terminal extension which may suggest that the N-terminal sequence codes for a signal peptide that is processed by E. coli similar to human cyclophilin B [32,33]. Alternatively, it is also possible that the 22-kDa protein band may represent a stable breakdown product of the recombinant protein. 3.7. Assay for PPIase

The soluble cell lysates of PET-PFCyP.C, PETPFCyP.P and pET9A were prepared and tested for PPIase activity. P. falciparum extract (Dd2 strain) was also prepared and assayed essentially as reported recently for the FCH5.C2 strain [18]. The results for PET-PFCyP.C and control (no extract) are presented in Fig. 5. PPIase activity was detected in all the

The inhibition experiments were performed twice as described in Materials and methods in triplicate wells at varying concentrations of the drug. The average values for one of the experiments were plotted against the concentration of CsA. 50% inhibition is observed at 0.3-0.5 pg ml-' concentration.

extracts including the P. falciparum extract. With the exception of the extract from E. coli containing pET9A (which should have only E. coli cyclophilin that is not sensitive to CsA [40]), pre-incubation of the extracts in the assay mixture with 1 PM CsA decreased the activities to a level observed in the absence of any extracts (Fig. 5). The steady increase in the absorbance of any extract was due to spontaneous isomerization of the peptide. These results from the PET-PFCyP.C and PET-PFCyP.P indicate that a portion of protein produced by the expression vectors folds into functionally active enzyme that is inhibited by the CsA. The PPIase activity was also detected in P. falciparum extracts that was sensitive to inhibition by CsA (not shown). 3.8. Inhibition of P. falciparum

The data for the soluble extract from PET-PFCyPC construct in the presence or absence of 1 PM CsA is presented. Control refers to the data obtained for an assay with no extract. The steady increase in control assay was due to spontaneous isomerization of the peptide. The initial absorbance values varied for each assay; they were reset to zero at the zero time point for convenience.

Antimalarial activity of CsA was re-examined for the chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) and chloroquine-resistant (Dd2) P. falciparum strains cultured in the presence of the drug for 48 h. The data from these

experiments (Fig. 6) indicated that CsA inhibits the parasite growth in both strains. 50% inhibition was observed at a concentration of 0.3-0.5 pg ml-' (0.25-0.4 PM). These values are slightly lower than the previously reported (OS-1 pg ml-`) for parasites exposed in the presence of CsA for 72 h [13,16,17]. The observed differences could be due to minor variations in the experimental conditions. However, these results provide additional evidence for inhibition of P. falciparum growth in vitro by CsA. Further, there is no difference in the sensitivity to CsA for chloroquine-sensitive or resistant strains of the parasite. In summary, a P. falciparum CyP gene with the complete coding sequence was cloned and characterized. The cloned gene possesses PPIase activity that is sensitive to inhibition by CsA. In addition, evidence was presented for the stage specific expression of the cloned gene. Although, the direct role of the PFCyP in the action of CsA on P. falciparum is not yet demonstrated, the recombinant PFCyP will be a useful tool for studying the molecular basis for CsA inhibition. Understanding of the mechanism(s) by which CsA compounds inhibit the parasite growth will be valuable to design potent inhibitors against malaria.
