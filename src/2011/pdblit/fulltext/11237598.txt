The N-carbamoyl-D-amino-acid amidohydrolase (D-NCAase) is used on an industrial scale for the production of D-amino acids. The crystal structure of D-NCAase was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering using xenon and gold derivatives, and re®ned Ê to 1.95 A resolution, to an R-factor of 18.6 %. The crystal structure shows a four-layer a/b fold with two six-stranded b sheets packed on either side by two a helices. One exterior layer faces the solvent, whereas the other one is buried and involved in the tight intersubunit contacts. A long C-terminal fragment extends from a monomer to a site near a dyad axis, and associates with another monomer to form a small and hydrophobic cavity, where a xenon atom can bind. Site-directed mutagenesis of His129, His144 and His215 revealed strict geometric requirements of these conserved residues to maintain a conformation of a putative catalytic cleft. A region located within this cleft involving Cys172, Glu47, and Lys127 is proposed for D-NCAase catalysis and is similar to the Cys-Asp-Lys site of N-carbamoylsarcosine amidohydrolase. The homologous active-site framework of these enzymes with distinct structures suggests convergent evolution of a common catalytic mechanism.

D-amino acids to produce D-amino acids with release of carbon dioxide and ammonia (Syldatk et al., 1990) (Figure 1). Together with a D-speci®c hydantoinase, the hydantoinase-NCAase reaction process is currently applied on an industrial scale to convert speci®c hydantoins into D-carbamoyl derivatives and subsequently into D-amino acids such as D-phenylglycine and D-p-hydroxyphenylglycine, the basic building blocks of b-lactam antibiotics (Takahashi et al., 1979; Olivieri et al., 1981). D-NCAase activity is produced by several microorganisms including Agrobacterium (Olivieri et al., 1981; Runser et al., 1990; Grifantini et al., 1996; È Nanba et al., 1998), Arthrobacter (Moller et al., 1988), and Comamonas (Ogawa et al., 1993). Thermotolerant bacteria such as Blastobacter sp. A17p-4 (Ogawa et al., 1994) and Pseudomonas sp. strain KNK003A (Ikenaka et al., 1998) are also isolated in an attempt to obtain a thermostable D-NCAase for more ef®-

cient industrial production. Biochemical and sequence studies of D-NCAases point to several interesting properties of this enzyme. First, D-NCAases share low sequence identities among different species; there was 61 % amino acid identity between Agrobacterium and Pseudomonas D-NCAases and 32 % amino acid identity between Agrobacterium and Methanobacter D-NCAases. D-NCAases, nevertheless, require a strict D-enantiomer of the N-carbamoyl amino acid as their substrate and they are negatively affected by oxidizing È conditions and sulfhydryl reagents (Moller et al., 1988; Ogawa et al., 1993, 1994). Biochemical and site-directed mutagenesis analysis suggest that a solvent-accessible cysteine residue Cys172 is a prime target for these reagents and is thus proposed as an active site residue (Grifantini et al., 1996). In addition, D-NCAase exists as an oligomeric form in solution; D-NCAase forms as a dimer in A. radiobacter (Grifantini et al., 1996) or a trimer in Blastobacter sp. A17p-4 (Ogawa et al., 1994). The importance of D-NCAase in the pharmaceutical industry prompted us to determine the atomic-resolution structure to gain an understanding of structural properties, the catalytic mechanism, and substrate speci®city of this enzyme. We have previously described the expression and preliminary crystallographic studies of D-NCAase from Agrobacterium radiobacter CCRC 14924 (Hsu et al., 1999). Ê Here, we report a 1.95 A crystal structure of D-NCAase solved by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (MIRAS) using xenon derivatives and a gold derivative. Mutagenesis data involving three conserved histidine residues allow us to identify the catalytic cleft in which Cys172 is situated. A catalytic Cys172Glu47-Lys127 site is therefore proposed for D-NCAase and is similar to the putative Cys-AspLys active site in N-carbamoylsarcosine amidohyÄ drolase (CSHase, EC 3.5.1.59) (Romao et al., 1992).

Results and Discussion
Structure description Ê The 1.95 A resolution and quality of the ®nal electron density map allowed us to build an accurate structural model of D-NCAase that includes a large number of well-de®ned water molecules (Figure 2). The model of the homotetramer (ABCD) has overall 222 symmetry and approximate dimenÊ Ê Ê sions of 70 A Â 70 A Â 65 A. Figure 3(a) shows

that the A and B (and C-D) subunits are related by a non-crystallographic dyad (179.8  ), whereas the A and D (and B-C) subunits are related by another local 2-fold axis (179.6  ). Subunits A and C (and BD) are related by the third local dyad (179.6  ), which is nearly perpendicular to the other two axes. Deviations from the non-crystallographic symmetry are small, with root-mean-square deviÊ ations (rmsd) between Ca atoms of 0.33 A for the Ê AB dimer and 0.24 A for the AD subunits. The largest deviations are found in two loops involved in crystal packing interactions: the A3-A4 hairpin (residues 101-106) and the most protruding region (residues 133-143) of the A5-H4 loop. The ®nal electron density is continuous from Arg3 to Phe304 for each of the four subunits. Poor density is seen for Met1 and Thr2, possibly because they are disordered in the N terminus. These residues are thus not included in the ®nal model. The segment of each monomer visible from Arg3 to Phe304 continuously in the crystal has a globular form with overall dimensions of Ê Ê Ê 35 A Â 35 A Â 40 A. Each subunit folds into a four-layer structure (Figure 3(a) and (b)). In the center, there are two six-stranded b sheets (sheets A and B) packed against each other. Sheet A consists of three parallel strands (A1, A2 and A3), followed by two antiparallel strands (A4, and A5), and strand A6 (residues 268-276), which is antiparallel to strand A1 (Figure 3(c)). Sheet B has a folding topology similar to that of sheet A (Figure 3(c)). In one exterior layer, there are two a helices (H1 and H3), whereas H5 and H6 are in the other surface layer. The adjacent layers are held together

primarily by hydrophobic contacts. Two helices H5, H6 along with the residues near the C terminus are buried in the tight AB intersubunit contacts. By contrast, H1 and H3 on the other surface are solvent-accessible and shield the interior sheets from the solvent. Several long loops connecting two secondary elements appear in one end of the four-layer structure. The A5-H4 loop, H4, and the following H4-B1 loop link together to form an extraordinarily extended loop (A5-H4-B1, residues 128-157) protruding outward. Likewise, the A2-H2 loop, H2, and the H2-H3 loop constitute a single

long loop (A2-H2-H3, residues 46-77) extending in from the same end. At the other end, there are all short turns or loops except for a long C-terminal segment (residues 277-304). It extends after strand A6, followed by two short a helices (H7 and H8) and runs over the neighboring subunit like a voluminous bulge near the dyad axis, and associates with another monomer. The main-chain and sidechain atoms of the loop region residues are well de®ned except for the 134-142 region. The average B-factor for atoms in the ¯exible 134-142 region is Ê Ê 43 A2, being highest for Tyr139 (50 A2), compared

254 Ê to an average B-factor of 26 A2 for all atoms in the tetramer. The intersubunit interaction The intersubunit contacts among the four subunits are very different (Figure 3(a)). Subunits A and B form a tight dimer, whereas the interaction of the A-D subunits and of the A-C subunits is looser. The total solvent-accessible surface of the Ê tetramer is 38,037 A2 as determined by use of a Ê probe (calculated by Areamol in CCP4) 1.4 A (CCP4, 1994). The total interface area between A Ê and B subunits is 2472 A2 as compared with Ê Ê 641 A2 for the A-D subunits and 372 A2 for the AC subunits. Buried residues at the A-B intersubunit interface are largely from the H5 and H6 helices and the C-terminal region of each monomer. There are 336 intersubunit interactions (atoms on differÊ ent subunits within 4.0 A) including 19 hydrogen bonds. The participation of the side-chains of Ile128, Pro152, Phe157, Trp177, Pro178, Val183, Leu186, Val205, Leu211, Phe214, Leu218, Tyr225, Thr255, Ile286, Phe287, Pro295, Tyr298, Leu300, Ile301, Ala302 and Phe304 in dimerization suggests that the interface is mostly hydrophobic. The high level of conservation of the residues forming the dimer interface, and in particular their hydrophobic character, suggests a stable AB dimer for D-NCAases. For the loosely packed A and D subunits, there are 56 interactions including four hydrogen bonds involving Thr263 and Arg278. For A and C subunits, there are only 17 interactions and no hydrogen bonds. The central region near the intersection of the three local axes is quite hydrophilic and ®lled with a number of water molecules. Xenon binding sites in the AB intermolecular cavities Xenon atoms were located by difference-Fourier calculations and further re®ned by SHARP (de la Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997). In the xenon derivative crystals, two xenon atoms are located on the A-B non-crystallographic 2-fold axis (Figure 4(a)) and are related to each other by the A-D dyad axis. As shown in Figure 4(b), xenon binds to a small, Ê Ê Ê closed cavity (4.2 A Â 4.2 A Â 4.2 A) formed by the intersubunit A-B contacts, similar to that observed in the case of the mosquitocidal d-endotoxin CytB (Li et al., 1996). The hydrophobic character of this pocket is apparent as judged by the absence of water molecules and by the interaction of the xenon atom with the hydrophobic portions of side-chains from Pro178, Glu179, Arg182 and Ile301 from each of the A and B subunits, respectively. The carboxyl group of Glu179 forms salt bridges or hydrogen bonds with the guanidinium group of Arg182, further stabilizing this pocket. Our results support those of previous studies suggesting that the xenon atoms bind in hydroÂ phobic cavities (Prange et al., 1998).

Site-directed mutagenesis of three conserved histidine residues In parallel with the structural analysis, sitedirected mutagenesis studies of three conserved histidine residues, His129, His144, and His215 were carried out. The H129A, H144A, and H215A mutants were ®rst generated and expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzymatic analysis showed greatly reduced activity for those mutants (Table 1): there was only 5 % and 17 % of relative activity for H144A and H215A, respectively, and no detectable activity for H129A. Two additional mutants of His129 were prepared, H129R and H129N. These mutants also lacked any detectable activity, indicating that His129 was essential in D-NCAase activity. Structural analysis of D-NCAase shows that His129 and His144 both lie at the longest A5-H4 loop, whereas His215 is situated at H6 (Figure 5(a)). The imidazole ring of His144 faces toward a sol-

255 respectively. These four residues are highly conserved among D-NCAases (Figure 3(d)). Given that Cys172, a putative active-site residue (see below) (Grifantini et al., 1996), is situated just next to Ile171 and Asp174, it is conceivable that His129 is required to provide a stable active-site fold around Cys172. The observation that all three mutants of His129 (H129A, H129R, and H129N) displayed no activity supports the crucial role of His129 in catalysis. For His144, there are 38 interactions between Ê His144 and its nearby residues (44.0 A) (Pro55, Pro131, Gly132, His133, Gln143, Leu145, and Glu146) including ionic interaction and a hydrogen network (four hydrogen bonds) among His144, His133 and Glu146 (Figure 5(c)), ®xing the sidechain geometry of His133, His144 and Glu146. His144 is also near a water molecule (Wat84) that is close to the -SH of Cys172. We therefore assume that replacement of His144 with Ala disrupts several of the interactions that are essential to maintain the stable conformation for catalysis, resulting in a signi®cant drop in the enzymatic activity. There are 51 interactions found for His215: 34 are intramolecular interactions (Arg176, Leu211, Thr212, Ser213, Phe214, His216, Leu217, Leu218 and Ser219) including three hydrogen bonds Ê (His215 (N)-Leu211 (O), 2.85 A, His215 (O)-Ser219

vent-accessible cleft, whereas that of His129 faces away from that cleft and is embedded inside of the protein. The side-chain of His215 is buried in the tight intersubunit contacts. For His129, there are 50 Ê interactions (44.0 A) with its nearby residues including Lys127, Ile128, Leu130, Pro131, Phe157, Asn173, Asp174, Trp177, Thr180, HisB292 and TyrB298 (B designates a residue from the B subunit). His129 makes hydrogen bonding or ionic interaction with Asp174 and TyrB298 (His129 (N)Ê Asp174 (Od1), 2.93 A, His129 (Nd1)-Asp174 (Od1), Ê Ê and His129 (Ne2)-TyrB298 (OZ), 2.60 A). In 2.72 A addition, a hydrogen network is formed among His129, Asp174, Ile171, and TyrB298 (Figure 5(b)), thus connecting the A5-H4 loop to the B2-H5 loop and to the C-terminal fragment from the B subunit,

256 Ê Ê (N), 3.24 A and His215 (O)-Ser219 (Og), 2.93 A) and 17 are intermolecular contacts (TyrB225 and ThrB255). It is especially noteworthy that the residues involved in intermolecular interactions are close to the proposed active-site cleft, thus implying that dimerization is required for enzyme function. Replacement of His215 with Ala led to a decrease of the relative activity to only 17 % supporting the structural role of His215. Our data thus collectively suggest strict geometric requirements of these 3 histidine residues in D-NCAase catalysis; His129 and His144 are required to maintain a stable conformation of the putative catalytic cleft, whereas His215 is crucial for maintaining the tight dimer essential for the enzyme activity. The active site Several lines of evidence indicated that Cys172 is an active-site residue. First, Cys172 is unusually reactive and can be speci®cally labeled with iodoacetate, resulting in an inactive form (Grifantini et al., 1996). Second, site-directed mutagenesis of Cys172 produces a non-functional mutant (Grifantini et al., 1996). Third, as discussed above, three conserved histidine residues, His129, His144, and His215, play an important role in maintaining the conformation of a solvent-accessible cleft, where Cys172 is also situated. Cys172 lies at the bottom of this cleft (Figure 5(a)), formed by three large loops (A2H2, A5-H4 and B3-H6), a short loop (B2-H5) and a C-terminal fragment from a neighbor subunit. Each subunit consists of one active site and the two sites in the AB dimer are close pairwise across the dyad axis. Within this pocket, there are eight water molecules that are surrounded by sidechains from 14 residues including Glu47, Phe53, Lys127, Pro131, His144, Glu146, Cys172, Asn173, Arg175, Arg176, Asn197, Thr198, Pro199, and Asn202. A comparison of the aligned D-NCAase primary sequence indicated that ®ve of these 14 residues were highly conserved among Agrobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Methanobacter D-NCAases: Glu47, Lys127, Glu146, Cys172, and Arg176. These ®ve residues are close to each other, clustered near the ¯oor of this cavity, and are most likely involved in amidohydrolytic catalysis. Cys172 is particularly close to the polar groups of Ê Glu47 and Lys127 (Glu47 (Oe1)-Cys172 (Sg), 3.39 A, Ê Glu47 (Oe2)-Cys172 (Sg), 3.99 A and Lys127 (Nz)Ê Cys172 (Sg), 3.76 A) which may increase the nucleophilicity of Cys172 toward its substrate. The side-chain (Nz) of Lys127 is stabilized by forming ionic interaction and hydrogen bonding with residues Glu47 (Oe2) and Glu146 (Oe1 and Oe2), whereas the side-chain of Glu47 is stabilized by interacting with residues Asn197, Asn110 and Ê Lys127 (Glu47 (Oe1)-Asn197 (N), 3.13 A, Glu47 e1 d1 Ê , Glu47 (Oe2)-Asn110 (O )-Asn197 (O ), 2.96 A Ê Ê (Nd2), 2.85 A and Glu47 (Oe2)-Lys127 (Nz), 2.84 A). Three water molecules are identi®ed near the Sg Ê atom of Cys172 (Figure 2): Wat58 (3.10 A), Wat84 Ê ), and Wat203 (3.63 A). These water Ê (3.50 A

molecules may also stabilize the binding pocket via interacting with Glu47, His144, Glu146 and Arg176 Ê (Wat58 (O)-Glu47 (Oe1), 2.79 A, Wat58 (O)-Glu146 e2 Ê , Wat58 (O)-Wat84 (O), 2.93 A, Wat84 Ê (O ), 2.80 A Ê (O)-His144 (Ne2), 3.29 A, Wat203 (O)-Arg176 (Ne), Ê Ê 3.18 A, Wat203 (O)-Arg176 (NZ2), 2.97 A). In an effort to understand the catalytic mechanism, the D-NCAase-D-p-hydroxyphenylglycine complex was modeled. The reactive carbamoyl group is positioned to be near side-chains of Cys172, Glu47 and Lys127 (see Materials and Methods). Figure 6(a) shows that Sg of Cys172 is close to the carbon atom of the carbamoyl moiety of the D-p-hydroxyphenylglycine and may subject to a nucleophilic attack. Residues including Phe53, Lys127, Pro131, His144, Glu146, Cys172, Asn173, Arg175, Arg176, Asn197, Thr198, Pro199 and Asn202 enclose the substrate. These residues form several intramolecular interactions that constitute a continuous envelope surrounding D-p-hydroxyphenylglycine. Since the dimensions of the envelope formed by this network are approximately Ê Ê Ê 8 A Â 8 A and 10 A deep, it can easily accommodate a large substrate such as D-p-hydroxyphenylglycine. Extensive interactions (59) are found Ê between D-NCAase and the substrate (44 A), particularly in the carbamoyl and the carboxyl moieties. For the carboxyl moiety, there are 24 interactions (Cys172, Asn173, Arg175, Arg176, Asn197 and Thr198) including three hydrogen bonds (Arg175, Arg176, and Thr198) (Figure 6(a)). For the carbamoyl moiety, there are 24 interactions (Phe53, Lys127, Pro131, His144, Glu146, Cys172, Asn197 and Pro199) including four hydrogen bonds (His144, Glu146 and Asn197) (Figure 6 (a)). Conceivably, these two groups of interactions would determine the substrate speci®city, thus enabling a ligand to bind with both the N-carbamoyl and a-carboxyl moieties. Given the ®xed orientation of these two groups, a relatively large volume for a side-chain of D-enantiomer is thus allowed. Instead, there is very limited space for a side-chain of the L-enantiomer. The observation that D-NCAase shows broad substrate speci®city toward N-carbamoyl-D-amino acid indeed supports this model. In addition, D-NCAase possesses preference for substrates such as D-phenylglycine, D-methionine, and D-leucine, that have a long/bulky hydrophobic side-chain (Ogawa et al., 1993; Nanba et al., 1998), suggesting that a substrate that provides more van der Waals contacts can bind better in this pocket. Based on this model, three nearby residues, Cys172, Glu47 and Lys127 are most likely to participate in the amidohydrolytic reaction. A plausible catalytic mechanism that consists of two stages is thus proposed. The ®rst stage is an acylation reaction of D-NCAase with the carbamoyl moiety, resulting in a cleavage of the susceptible C-N bond and the liberation of an NH3 molecule: (i) the Sg atom of Cys172 carries out a nucleophilic attack on the C atom of the carbonyl group, (ii) the adjacent carboxyl group of Glu47 then accepts the proton of

the -SH group, (iii) the Nz of Lys127 possibly stabilizes an acquired transient tetrahedral intermediate carrying an oxyanion near it, and (iv) the proton held by Glu47 is then donated to the nitrogen atom of the susceptible C-N bond, which thus is cleaved and produces an ammonia molecule. The next stage involves the deacylation of the acylenzyme intermediate. A water molecule may take the place occupied earlier by the amine component of the substrate, followed by reactions similar to those at the previous stage, with water substituting for the amine component: (i) Glu47 draws a proton away from water, (ii) the resulting OHÀ ion attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of the acyl group that is attached to Cys172, (iii) a transient tetrahedral intermediate is formed, which is stabilized by Lys127, and (iv) Glu47 then donates the proton to the sulfur atom of Cys172, which then releases the acid component that may further decomposes into a D-amino acid and a CO2 molecule. Comparison with other protein structures Based on the analysis by the program DALI (Holm & Sander, 1994), there is no signi®cant similarity with other proteins currently in the Protein Data Bank. However, the four-layer a/b sandwich seen in the D-NCAase structure is not uncommon and has been found in members of N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) amidohydrolases including glu-

tamine PRPP amidotransferase (Smith et al., 1994), penicillin acylase (Duggleby et al., 1995), the 20 S È proteasome (Lowe et al., 1995) and aspartylglucosaminidase (Oinonen et al., 1995). The amino-terminal residue (cysteine, serine, or threonine) of the Ntn hydrolases, situated in the deep pocket of the funnel-shaped catalytic site, acts as the catalytic nucleophile and uses its own a-amino group as a general base for an autocatalytic, self-cleavage reaction. This fold is found also in other functionally unrelated proteins, like purple acid phosphatase (Klabunde et al., 1996), metallo b lactamase (Concha et al., 1996), and deoxyribonuclease I (Lahm & Suck, 1991). Despite the lack of any signi®cant sequence identity among these proteins, the similar topologies suggest that the four-layer a/b fold provides a stable domain with distinct active-site organization to support a variety of different functions. During preparation of this manuscript, we became aware that Nakai et al. (2000) reported the crystal structure of D-NCAase from Agrobacterium sp. strain KNK712, which shared 97 % sequence identity with the enzyme from Agrobacterium radiobacter CCRC 14924. Since the coordinates are not available, these two structures cannot be directly compared. The overall fold of these structures, nevertheless, is the same, based on their report. We thus compare the D-NCAase structure to the Ä CSHase structure (Romao et al., 1992), which is the

258 only other enzyme of a known three-dimensional structure that catalyzes the amidohydrolytic reaction of an N-carbamoyl moiety. It appears that there is a low level of similarity in sequence or overall tertiary structure between these two enzymes. Instead of a four-layer sandwich, CSHase has a three-layer structure (a central six-stranded parallel b sheet packed by helices on either side). These two enzymes, nevertheless, have a similar homotetramer quaternary arrangement. In addition, superposition of the active-site region for these two enzymes reveals an interesting similarity; the disposition of three active-site residues (CysA177, AspA51, and LysA144) in CSHase coincides roughly with that of Cys172, Glu47, Lys127 in D-NCAase (Figure 6(a) and (b)), in accordance with their common amidohydrolytic catalysis. There are, however, apparent differences in other regions of their binding pockets. For instance, the residues proposed to be responsible for the interaction with the carboxyl moiety in Ä CSHase (ArgA202 and LysB217) (Romao et al., 1992) and in D-NCAase (Arg175, Arg176 and Thr198) have distinct orientations relative to the Cys-Glu/Asp-Lys active site. In addition, a hydrophobic pocket (Phe63, Ile115, Leu120, and Trp111) that can bind to the N-methyl group of the carbamoylsarcosine molecule is not seen in the D-NCAase structure, in accordance with the fact that CSHase is highly speci®c towards carbamoylsarcosine, whereas D-NCAase shows a substrate speci®city towards various N-carbamoyl-D-amino acids. The common active-site framework and functional similarity but rather different structures between these two enzymes thus suggests that the Cys-Glu/Asp-Lys active site provides an ef®cient way of catalyzing the cleavage of the C-N bond in a carbamoyl moiety and may be a result of convergent evolution.

Crystal Structure of D-NCAase screening of the transformants on glucose-minimal medium. Single-stranded DNA from the mutant clones was prepared and subjected to dideoxy sequencing to con®rm the successful mutations. Enzyme activity was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography using N-carbamoyl-D-p-hydroxyphenylglycine as substrate (Louwrier & Knowles, 1996). Data collection and processing Before data collection, crystals were transferred to mineral oil for a few minutes and then ¯ash-frozen in a liquid nitrogen stream. Data were collected at À150  C using an MSC X-Stream Cryo-system with a doublemirror-focused CuKa X-ray radiation generated from a Rigaku RU-300 rotating-anode generator. Additional native and xenon derivative data sets were collected using a MAR Research detector at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beamline 7-1. Data were processed and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). For data collected at SSRL, MOSFLM (Leslie, 1987) and the CCP4 (1994) suite of programs were used to index and merge each individual data set. Structure determination A search for derivatives revealed that several heavyatom compounds including (NH4)2U2O7, Hg(NO3)2, KAuCl4, Ru(NH3)6Cl3 were able to bind to the crystalline protein. However, these derivatives were not isomorphous with the native crystals and shared one or two common sites. Two xenon derivatives were prepared according to Stowell et al. (1996) and were processed Ê Ê to 2.3 A, 2.6 A, respectively, using X-ray source from rotating-anode generator: one was treated with 220 (1 psi % 6.9 kPa) psi of xenon gas for ®ve minutes (XeI) and the other was treated with 220 psi of xenon gas for 15 minutes (XeII). Another one was treated with 220 psi of xenon gas for eight minutes (XeIII) and was collected Ê to 1.74 A resolution at SSRL. Because of the low I/sigma Ê I in the outer shells, the data were truncated at 1.95 A. Heavy-atom re®nement was done by the program SHARP (de la Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997). Phases for the D-NCAase were obtained by MIRAS in the xenon derivatives. The best results were obtained when the inhouse collected KAuCl4 and two xenon derivative data were combined with the native and xenon derivative data collected at SSRL. The two in-house xenon derivative data sets were treated individually, as two ``crystals'' of the same ``compound'', whereas the xenon derivative data collected at SSRL was treated as another ``compound'', following SHARP terminology. The Ê MIRAS phases were re®ned and extended to 1.95 A using the solvent ¯ipping procedure in the program SOLOMON (Abrahams & Leslie, 1996). Model building and refinement The MIRAS electron-density map was readily interpretable and the main-chain trace was built into the density using the program O version 6.2 (Jones et al., 1991). We also used the program wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999) for automatic model tracing. Remarkably, wARP was able to automatically trace 93 % of the four subunits, con®rming the manual chain tracing and ®tting of the amino acid sequence in the density.

Materials and Methods
Enzyme purification and crystallization D-NCAase was expressed, puri®ed and crystallized as described (Hsu et al., 1999). Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method using protein solutions containing $15 mg/ml protein in 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.02 % (w/v) sodium azide and reservoirs consisting of 1.15 M lithium sulfate, 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.0 at 23  C). The crystals belong to space Ê group P21 with unit cell dimensions a  70.23 A, Ê Ê b  67.53 A, c  137.48 A, and b  96.12  . There are four molecules per asymmetric unit. Site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme assays For site-directed mutagenesis, the BamHI-HindIII fragment containing the D-NCAase gene was cloned into phage M13mp19 to generate pM19-DNCA. The uridinylated DNA template of pM19-DNCA was prepared in E. coli CJ236 and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed according to Kunkel et al. (1987) by use of the Muta-Gene M13 in vitro Mutagenesis kit from BioRad. E. coli MV1190 was used as the recipient strain for

Crystallographic re®nement was carried out using the maximum-likelihood program REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) coupled to ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1993), which was used to add water molecules automatically. The structure was re®ned against native diffraction data Ê to 1.95 A. The ®nal model has an R-factor of 0.186 for È 88,788 re¯ections. The free R-factor (Brunger, 1992) calculated using 4682 re¯ections omitted from the re®nement, is 23.9 %. The ®nal electron density consists of a homotetramer (ABCD) per asymmetric unit and is continuous from Arg3 to Phe304 for each of the subunit. The protein model was assessed using the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Based on the Ramachandran plot, a total of 937 (91.9 %) non-glycine and non-proline residues have their f, j, angles in the most-favored region, whereas the remaining 79 (7.8 %) non-glycine and non-proline residues are in the additional allowed region. Only one residue, Cys172, lies in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot, but Ê has well-de®ned density and the B factor is low (20 A2). The unusual geometry is probably stabilized by three hydrogen bonds around this peptide unit: Cys172 O Á Á ÁN Asn174, Cys172 O...NZ1 Arg175, and Cys172 N Á Á Á O Gly195. A summary of data collection and the re®nement statistics is shown in Table 2. Structure comparisons were carried out with the program DALI (Holm & Sander, 1993). Figure 2 was prepared using BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1999); Figures 3(a) and (b), and 4-6 were generated with the programs MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) and Raster 3D (Merrit & Murphy, 1994). Modeling of the D-NCAase-substrate complex N-Carbamoyl-D-p-hydroxyphenylglycine was chosen as a substrate to attempt to build a D-NCAase-substrate model. The modules Dock, Builder and Discover (with the CVFF force®eld) in Insight II 98.0 software package (BIOSYM/MSI) were used in the modeling. A roughly docked complex was ®rst obtained by manually docking the substrate into the pocket such that the Sg atom of Cys172 was close to the carbon atom of the carbamoyl moiety and the side-chain (Nz) of Lys127 was close to the oxygen atom of the carbamoyl moiety and that the oxygen atom of a-COO- was close to the guanidinium group of Arg176, whereas the hydroxyphenyl group pointed toward an empty space. The Monte Carlo method in combination with in vacuo energy minimization using a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4 was then employed to obtain the model of the enzyme-substrate complex. Molecular dynamics simulations were subsequently performed with a time-step of 1 fs for 5000 fs and a temperature of 300 K. Protein Data Bank accession number The coordinates of D-NCAase have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession code 1FO6.
