Yeast hypothetical protein YBL036C (SWISS-PROT P38197), initially thought to be a member of an 11-protein family, was selected for crystal structure determination since no structural or functional information was available. The structure has been determined independently by MIR and MAD methods Ê to 2.0 A resolution. The MAD structure was determined largely through automated model building. The protein folds as a TIM barrel beginning with a long N-terminal helix, in contrast to the classic triose phosphate isomerase (TIM) structure, which begins with a -strand. A cofactor, pyridoxal 5H -phosphate, is covalently bound near the C-terminal end of the barrel, the usual active site in TIM-barrel folds. A singledomain monomeric molecule, this yeast protein resembles the N-terminal domain of alanine racemase or ornithine decarboxylase, both of which are two-domain dimeric proteins. The yeast protein has been shown to have amino-acid racemase activity. Although selected as a member of a protein family having no obvious relationship to proteins of known structure, the protein fold turned out to be a well known and widely distributed fold. This points to the need for a more comprehensive base of structural information and better structure-modeling tools before the goal of structure prediction from amino-acid sequences can be realised. In this case, similarity to a known structure allowed inferences to be made about the structure and function of a widely distributed protein family.

1. Introduction
Protein sequences generated by the Human Genome Project and other associated projects are revealing many proteins with related sequences that can be grouped together as families of similar folds and/or functions. Some of these groups have functional information but not structural information, while others lack both. It is also possible for groups distant in sequence similarity to have structural or fold similarity. Grouping of proteins on the basis of sequence homology is based on the assumption that related proteins will have similar function. However, if structural information is available, it may be possible to determine the function even if the sequence similarity is distant (Murzin & Patthy, 1999). The function of a protein is better determined by the threedimensional structure than by the sequence itself (Oliver, 1996). Amino-acid residues separated in sequence space come together to form a functional site in three-dimensional space. Often, distantly related sequences contain similar sequence motifs that form a functional site. Accordingly, the threedimensional structures of proteins are required at the atomic level to ultimately understand the function. Also, protein domains with similar sequences share similar folds, although

occasionally proteins with low sequence similarity may also share similar folds (Orengo et al., 1994). Hence, the determination of the three-dimensional structure of one representative member of a protein family will provide a model for the entire family and thus provide insight into their possible function (Moult & Melamud, 2000). The structural genomics approach thus provides a general approach to study the function of a class of proteins (Bork & Eisenberg, 2000). Such an approach has become possible because of technological advances in methods of cloning, expression, puri®cation and structure determination on a large scale. The sequence information coupled with structural and functional information would provide an information-intensive database that could be used for various applications including medicine, agriculture etc. (Montelione & Anderson, 1999). The aim of the Structural Genomics Project is to understand the structure and function of the several thousand proteins involved in the genome (Burley et al., 1999). For a target organism we selected the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, since it is a eukaryote with a known genome sequence and with many genes having human homologues, is easily manipulated biochemically and genetically for studies of protein function and is the focus of intensive study by a large research community who could bene®t from almost any structure determined (Sanchez & Sali, 1998). Details of proteins selected for study in this Structural Genomics Project can be found on our home page http://www.proteome.bnl.gov. The crystal structure of a yeast hypothetical protein, YBL036C (SWISS-PROT P38197) referred to as P007 is presented here. from Stratagene, was used for PCR reactions. All chemicals used for reagents and buffers were reagent grade and solutions were made up with Milli-Q water. All puri®cation steps were carried out at 295 K. The gene representing the coding sequence of P007 was obtained by PCR using yeast genomic DNA as a template. Primers were designed which were complementary to the 5H and 3H regions of the coding sequence and which included a NdeI or a BamHI restriction site, respectively, for insertion into the T7 expression vector pET13a (Gerchman et al., 1994). Sequences were veri®ed with ¯uorescent sequencing techniques. The resultant clone was transformed into Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3), which contains the T7 RNA polymerase gene on the host chromosome under the control of the lac promoter. Protein expression resulted from induction with isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Studier et al., 1990). P07pLK 834DE3 cells were cultured in 1 l of TBYG broth (containing 10 g bacto-tryptone, 5 g NaCl, 5 g yeast extract and 0.4% glucose) in a 3 l Fernbach ¯ask shaken at a constant temperature of 310 K. The medium was supplemented with 25 mg mlÀ1 of kanamycin to maintain the plasmid. Upon reaching an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm, the culture was induced with IPTG to a ®nal concentration of 0.5 mM. After 3 h, the culture medium was harvested by centrifugation at 7000 rev minÀ1 in a Sorvall GSA 3000 rotor for 10 min. Approximately 6 g of wet cell paste was obtained per litre of culture medium.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Target selection

Yeast hypothetical protein YBL036C (SWISS-PROT P38197) was chosen for structure determination. At the time of selection, this protein belonged to a family of 11 proteins, UPF0001 (uncharacterized protein family) in SWISS-PROT, with a wide evolutionary range, including human. The sequence homology among the family members extended over almost the full length of each protein, but no functional information was available for any of them. None of the proteins had signi®cant sequence similarity by PSI-BLAST analysis to any protein whose structure was available in the PDB. A structure for the yeast protein would provide a template for homology modeling of other proteins in the family and might provide clues to the function of this well conserved and widely distributed family. At the present time, Pfam lists 43 proteins as members of this family (Pfam accession No. PF01168).
2.2. Cloning and expression

Genomic DNA was isolated from the wild-type S. cerevisiae strain S288c obtained from the Yeast Genetics Stock Center at the University of California at Berkeley. Primers were ordered from Life Technologies. DNA polymerase PFU, purchased

E. coli cells ($5 g) containing the overexpressed protein were thawed and resuspended in a homogenizer in 50 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) containing 0.05 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ¯uoride and 0.05 mM benzamidine hydrochloride. The cells were lysed by the addition of lysozyme (Sigma) to 1 mg mlÀ1 and 0.8%(w/v) deoxycholate to a ®nal concentration of 0.04%. The cell suspension was incubated on ice for about 15 min or until high viscosity was attained. To the cell lysate were added 1 mM MnCl2, 10 mM MgCl2 and 20 mg mlÀ1 DNAse I. The mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min. Nucleic acids were precipitated with the addition of 10%(v/v) Polymin P to a ®nal concentration of 0.5%. The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 12 000 rev minÀ1 in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. The pellet was reextracted with 25 ml of lysis buffer and centrifuged again as described above. The supernatants were combined and loaded onto a 1 Â 20 cm Fractogel EMD TMAE-650 (M) column (EM Separations Technology). The target protein was eluted with a 10 column-volume linear gradient between 0 and 0.5 M NaCl with 25 mM HEPES pH 8.0. Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled, concentrated and loaded onto two SEC columns connected in series (TSK G3000PW and G3000SW, both 21.5 mm Â 60 cm) equilibrated with 25 mM MES pH 6.5 and 200 mM NaCl. Fractions containing pure protein were identi®ed by electrophoresis on 8±25% SDS± PAGE, pooled, concentrated on a Centriprep-10 concentrator

Crystals were grown in acetate buffer pH 4.6 by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Mother liquor containing equal volumes of protein (10 mg mlÀ1) and precipitant consisting of 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate and 30% PEG MME 2000 yielded crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction. Data from the native crystals were collected at 100 K at beamline X8C of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory using a MAR Research image plate and were processed with DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Rsym is 0.064 for 17 243 re¯ections and the completeness is 99.5%. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 and diffracted to better Ê than 2.1 A resolution. Data were collected from a number of heavy-atom derivative crystals (Au, Hg, Pt etc.) at NSLS beamlines X12B and X12C. For every derivative, the wavelength was adjusted to the corresponding absorption edge of the heavy atom in order to optimize the anomalous signal. Ê Most of the derivative crystals diffracted to 2.7 A or better. Selenomethionine-derivatized protein was subsequently prepared and crystals were grown under similar conditions to check the feasibility of accelerated structure determination by the multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) procedure (Ramakrishnan & Biou, 1997). MAD data from a selenomethionine-derivative crystal were collected at the X12C beamline of the NSLS. Three data sets, at peak Ê Ê Ê (0.9800 A), edge (0.9803 A) and remote (0.9300 A) wavelengths, were collected with the inverse-geometry method using an automated procedure (Skinner & Sweet, 1998). Data were processed with DENZO and merged with SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Data-collection statistics for MAD data are included in Table 1.
2.5. Structure determination and refinement 2.5.1. MIRAS method. The structure was solved by the multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (MIRAS) method. Good heavy-atom derivative data were obtained with crystals soaked in potassium gold cyanide, mersalyl acid and potassium hexachloroplatinate(IV). The heavy-atom positions were obtained using the program PHASES (Furey & Swaminathan, 1997) and were re®ned using the isomorphous difference with the native and the anomalous difference of the derivative data. The number of heavy-atom positions obtained for each derivative and the re®nement statistics are presented in Table 1. Phases were further improved by solvent ¯attening. The electron-density map with these phases revealed a TIM-barrel structure with a few gaps. The backbone model was built in O using the `baton' option. The side chains were manually ®tted into the electron density. 24 residues of the possible 257 could not be seen in the electron density and the polypeptide was discontinuous in two places.

cofactor was modeled as pyridoxal 5H -phosphate (PLP) since UV/VIS absorption spectrum measurements indicated the presence of PLP and also because addition of PLP greatly increased the protein yield during puri®cation. The R value and Rfree dropped to 0.297 and 0.346, respectively, upon the inclusion of PLP for re®nement. A composite omit map was calculated at this stage using CNS and the model was further È adjusted (Brunger et al., 1998). The model was further re®ned with CNS. Finally, 161 water molecules were added in stages to account for the residual density in the ' A-weighted 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps and re®ned.

The phases were re®ned by SHARP (de La Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997) and further improved by solvent ¯attening and phase extension with SOLOMON (Abrahams & Leslie, 1996). The data Ê collected at the remote wavelength (0.93 A) were used for re®nement of the model. With the experimental phases and Ê structure amplitudes of re¯ections extending to 2.0 A resolution as input, ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999) completed the initial model building. The ARP/wARP model had ®ve chains and 211 residues (of the possible 257 residues) with a connectivity index of 0.95. The side-chain building/docking of ARP/wARP placed 111 residues (53%) of the side chains correctly. Also, the electron density for the cofactor was ®lled with free atoms. The remaining side chains and the cofactor, pyridoxal 5H -phosphate, were built with O. Water molecules were added with ARP/wARP and REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) was used for re®nement. The ®nal R and Rfree values are 0.196 and 0.245, respectively. 28 amino acids are missing in this model, as in the case of the MIR model.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and fold

This hypothetical protein exists as a monomer and folds as a TIM barrel (Banner & Waley, 1975), a known superfold adopted by many protein families. The structure comprises eight consecutive / motifs with parallel -strands (1±8) forming a barrel covered by -helices (1±8), as shown in Fig. 1. The electron density for the model and the cofactor is very good except for two loops and the C-terminal region (Fig. 2). The ®rst three residues are missing because of poor electron density in that region. Five residues, Val35±Ala39, Figure 1 between 1 and 1, eight residues, Asn187±Lys194, between A RIBBONS (Carson, 1991) representation of the fold of the yeast hypothetical protein with the numbering of the secondary-structure 6 and 6, and 11 residues, Ala247±Ile257, at the C-terminal motifs. -Helices and -strands are represented in red and green, are not visible in the electron-density map. Accordingly, these respectively. two loops of the protein, together with the 11 C-terminal residues, are not included in the model. The cofactor is covalently bound to Lys49 at the C-terminal end of the ®rst strand, 1. The side-chain conformation of residues Lys100, Glu204 and Glu229 must be treated with caution as the electron density is weak for these side chains. The TIM barrel starts with a long -helix unlike most TIM-barrel structures, e.g. triose phosphate isomerase (Banner & Waley, 1975), xylanase (Natesh et al., 1999) and mandelate racemase (Neidhart et al., 1990) listed in TIM-DB (Pujadas & Palau, 1999), which all start with a -strand. This type of barrel has recently been seen in a few other structures containing the cofactor pyridoxal Figure 2 5H -phosphate (PLP; Kern et al., 1999; Shaw et ' A-weighted 2Fo À Fc map showing the electron density for PLP and residues in the putative active site.

O1P of PLP is hydrogen bonded to Gly241 N and Ser224 O. O2P interacts with Ala225 N through a water molecule (Wat314). O3P interacts with Thr242 O1.

3.2. Pyridoxal 5H -phosphate in TIM barrel

The PLP is covalently bound to Lys49 and is located at the C-terminal side of the barrel. Lys49, Asn70, Ser224, Arg239, Gly241 and Thr242 constitute the putative active site. It is located in the middle of the opening at the C-terminal end of the barrel, with C4A of the pyridine ring forming a covalent bond with Lys49 N4 at the surface of the barrel (Fig. 3). O3 of the PLP forms a hydrogen bond with Asn70 N2. N1 of the pyridine ring forms a hydrogen bond with N4 and NH2 of Arg239. The rest of the barrel is ®lled with a network of hydrogen-bonding interactions between side chains. All the nitrogen centers of Arg239 are involved in hydrogen bonding. Arg239 NH1 forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with O and O of Ser220, while Arg239 NH2 forms a hydrogen bond with Thr182 O. Other side chains involved in hydrogen-bond network are those of Ser220, Glu112, Glu237 and His89. This

A search for families of structurally similar proteins (FSSP; Holm & Sander, 1996) brings up alanine racemase (ARC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) structures with Z scores of 18.6 and 16.2 (high Z scores indicate good structural simiÊ larity); the r.m.s.d.s are 2.7 and 2.8 A, respectively, although these proteins did not show up in the family of proteins with similar sequence during the initial target-selection procedure (Kern et al., 1999; Shaw et al., 1997). When compared with the classical TIM barrel of triose phosphate isomerase, the Z score Ê is 9.5 and the r.m.s.d. is 3.8 A. P007, ARC and ODC all contain an N-terminal -helix unlike the classic TIM-barrel fold, although the length of the -helix is longer in P007. The major difference between the yeast hypothetical protein and the other two structures is that the yeast hypothetical protein is a single-domain structure while the other two are two-domain structures with a TIM-barrel domain and a -sheet domain. Also, ARC and ODC exist as dimers, unlike P007. The agreement between P007 and ARC was poor when the C atoms of the entire TIM barrel were used in the least-squares ®t. The best matches show good agreement for four strands (1, 2, 7 and 8) and part of two more strands (3 and 6). The rest of the structure did not match, although the topology is the same.

It is interesting to note that in spite of this structural similarity, the structure of P007 could not be determined by the molecular-replacement method by us using ARC as a search model. P007 is the only single-domain structure known to contain a PLP molecule in the TIM-barrel fold. The electrostatic potential surface (Fig. 5) shows the depth of the cavity and the location of the cofactor in P007. The mode of binding of PLP in P007 is similar to that in ARC and ODC. A lysine from the C-terminal end of the ®rst -strand of the TIM barrel forms a Schiff base with the PLP Figure 4 in all three structures. The residues involved Superposition of P007 and the TIM-barrel domain of ARC shows similarity near the active site. The helices and the strands at the other side deviate considerably. The brute-force in the PLP site of P007 and ODC are Ê alignment of LSQMAN matched 154 atoms with an r.m.s.d. of 1.72 A. different except for the Schiff base. Speci®cally, N1 of PLP interacts with an arginine in P007 and ARC, but with an aspartic acid in ODC. The putative active site and the conserved residues of P007 resemble ARC. The hydrogenbonding interactions, N1 of the pyridine ring to N4 of an arginine and O1P of the phosphate group to O of a serine, are the same, in addition to the Schiff base (Fig. 6). Apart from these three conserved interactions, there are some similarities and dissimilarities. In ARC, Tyr43, Tyr354 and Arg136 interact with PLP, although Tyr354 belongs to the second domain and not to the TIM-barrel domain. The interactions of the tyrosines are through their hydroxyl groups. Spatially, Thr242 of P007 is between the positions of Tyr43 and Tyr354 and its hydroxyl group interacts with the PLP. The most important difference is the interaction of Tyr265 (not shown in the ®gure) of the second monomer in ARC. This interaction is absent in P007 since P007 exists as a monomer. It has been reported (Watanabe et al., 1999) that Lys39 abstracts hydrogen from d-alanine to convert it into l-alanine while Tyr265 does the same thing for l-alanine. In the absence of an interaction similar to Tyr265, it is not clear how the racemization from lto d-alanine can take place in P007. In ARC, His166 forms a bridge between Tyr265 and Arg219, and helps in making Figure 5 Tyr265 negatively charged (Sun & Toney, 1999), while in P007 Surface potential (Nicholls et al., 1991) and active-site cavity of P007, with this His166 is absent. These differences suggest that if P007 is the cofactor placed in the cavity. The negative and positive potentials are an alanine racemase, the conversion from d to l could be represented in red and blue, respectively. The stick model in pink is PLP and that in white is lysine, with N4, which makes the Schiff base, in blue. explained in a similar way to that by ARC, but not the conversion from l to d. Since three of the PLP-site interactions are the same for P007 and ARC, it was suspected that P007 may be an amino-acid racemase and accordingly it was tested for d-alanine racemase activity. Though it exhibited d- to l-alanine racemase activity, further tests are required to verify l- to d-alanine activity and to Figure 6 Comparison of the active sites of the P007 and ARC structures.

Additional residues Tyr43 and domain, which presumably determines Tyr354 of ARC are not present in P007.

The structure determination of this protein helped to model 45 other proteins in this family with the TIM-barrel fold by sequence similarity using Modeler (Sanchez & Sali, 1998). Since the models are based on sequence similarity, neither ARC nor ODC is in the list of proteins modeled. A careful comparison of the PLP site might give some clue to the activity of these proteins. This structure has also been used as a template in ProDom to model a family of 42 uncharacterized proteins (including P007) that might bind to PLP. Members of the family are found in prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins, including proline synthetase-associated protein in eubacteria and human. The sequence alignment of these proteins with

P007, together with the secondary-structural elements of P007, is given in Fig. 7. The sequence corresponding to the ®rst -helix does not align well with other proteins. The ®ve residues Lys49, Asn70, Ser224, Arg239 and Gly241 involved in PLP binding in P007 are either identical or highly conserved in all of them. Also, residues corresponding to Val47, Ile91 and Met223 that sit on either side of the pyridine ring in P007 are almost conserved in the whole family. The conservation of these residues suggests that the orientation of PLP might be the same in all of them. According to PROSITE, the consensus sequence of this family is [FW]-H-[FM]-[IV]-G-x-[LIV]-Q-x-[NKR]-K-x3[LIV] and extends from residues 88 to 102 of P007. Interestingly, this includes neither the conserved residue Lys49 which is covalently bound to PLP nor the other residues interacting with the PLP molecule. This is true for all the proteins shown in Fig. 7. It may be that the consensus sequence is required for substrate recognition in these proteins. The residues in the consensus sequence lie in helix 3, strand 4 and the loop connecting them. In ARC and ODC, the respective consensus sequence contains the conserved residue lysine attached to PLP. In ARC, the consensus sequence follows a left-handed helix with Lys39 at the beginning of the helix (Kleywegt, 1999). In P007, Lys49 is at the C-terminus of the 1 strand and there is no left-handed helix. However, the next residue Leu50 has positive 9±2 values and lies just outside the generously allowed region in the Ramachandran plot, which could be a consequence of the constraint on Lys49 attached to PLP. In ODC there is also no left-handed helix for the consensussequence region.

The crystal structure was ®rst determined by the MIRAS method before the selenomethionine protein became available. A number of derivatives were used and the model was built manually by a conventional method using O. The whole process from data collection to re®nement took about a month. This was largely because of the synchrotron time that was readily available to us at the time. Subsequently, selenomethionine protein became available and the structure was redetermined by the MAD method (Hendrickson & Ogata, 1997). This structure determination was performed in a highthroughput manner without any reference to the MIRAS

model. Since the model was built by ARP/wARP, the structure determination was completed in a week. Since one of the major concerns in structural genomics projects is data-collection time and the ef®cient use of synchrotron beam time, a few further structure-determination trials were carried out using the available data. The SIRAS (single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering) method on the gold derivative was tried, as the phasing power for this derivative was high. Though the solvent-¯attened phases gave a good electron-density map, the model could not be built easily as the map had lot of discontinuities. The structure was also determined by the SAD (single-wavelength anomalous dispersion) method using the data collected at the peak wavelength (data not presented). This was again performed in a high-throughput manner. This was perfomed to test whether minimum synchrotron beam time could be used for structure determination. The method worked very well and gives us con®dence that SAD data are suf®cient to solve the structure, as has been shown by many others. In order to estimate which experimental method gives the best initial set of phases, the experimental and solvent-¯attened phases were compared with the calculated phases from the ®nal model. In the case of the SIRAS method the ®nal model was taken as the MIRAS model, whereas for MAD and SAD the corresponding re®ned models were considered. The results are presented in Table 3. The large average phase difference in the case of SIRAS is probably the reason why it was dif®cult to trace the polypeptide chain. The MIR and MAD structures were considered as independent models and compared by a least-squares ®t. The Ê r.m.s. deviation between these two models is 0.266 A (when comparing the C positions of 227 common residues). Except for lysine residues and Glu24, the side-chain conformations agreed well in the two structures. Most of the water molecules bound to the protein were well conserved. However, there was less agreement in the second-layer water molecules. Also, probably owing to the map quality, the MIR model had a lesser number of water molecules. In both cases the models are of excellent quality as judged by the Ramachandran plots (about 90% of residues in the most favored regions) and the real-space correlation coef®cients between the model and the corresponding ' A-weighted 2Fo À Fc electron-density maps (Fig. 8). ences, and suggests that P007 might have a limited racemase activity. The structure determination of this protein helped in modeling several related proteins with the TIM-barrel fold by sequence similarity.

4. Conclusions
Proteins selected on the basis of very low sequence similarity to known structures are expected to reveal new folds in many cases. However, in the case of P007 the molecule folds in the well known and well distributed TIM-barrel fold, with the difference that P007 starts with a long N-terminal -helix while the conventional TIM-barrel structures start with a -strand. It is not surprising that the target selection missed molecules such as alanine racemase and ornithine decarboxylase with a similar fold and also containing PLP as cofactor, since the sequence similarity was very low. Comparison of the PLP-binding sites revealed that these sites of P007 and ARC are very similar, with only minor differActa Cryst. (2003). D59, 127±135
