ABSTRACT The human IMPA2 gene, which encodes myo-inositol monophosphatase 2 (IMPA2), is mapped onto 18p11.2, a susceptibility region for bipolar disorder. This chromosomal region has also been proposed to include a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia and febrile seizures. Here we report the crystal structures of human IMPA2 and its complex with calcium and phosphate ions. Human IMPA2 comprises an a­b protein with a five-layered sandwich of a-helices and b-sheets (a­b­a­b­a). The crystal structure and analytical ultracentrifugation results indicated that IMPA2 exists as a dimer in solution. The overall structure of IMPA2 is similar to that of IMPA1, except for the loop regions. In IMPA1, the loop region (31­43) is located at the entrance of the active site cavity. In the corresponding region (42­54) of IMPA2, the residues are disordered and partially form an a-helix. The structural difference in the opening of the active site cavity suggests that the substrate specificity differs between IMPA1 and IMPA2. The widely opened cavity of IMPA2 implies that the physiological substrate may be a larger compound than inositol monophosphate. The structure of IMPA2 complexed with Ca2+ revealed two metals and one phosphate binding sites, which were the same sites as in IMPA1 complexed with Mn2+ and phosphate, suggesting that the mechanism of the enzymatic reaction is similar to that of IMPA1. The crystal structures of human IMPA2 are useful for understanding the effect of nonsynonymous polymorphism reported in IMPA2, and will contribute to further functional analyses of IMPA2 that potentially predisposes to the vulnerabilities of bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and febrile seizures.

Following the report of a linkage to bipolar disorder in the broad centromeric region of chromosome 18,1 a genetic analysis with densely-spaced markers on the same pedigree series localized the maximal peak of excess allele sharing in affected-sib-pairs to 18p11.2.2 The most replicated and common linkage interval of bipolar disorder on 18p11.2 is localized between D18S464 and D18S323,2 spanning $1.8 Mb. Increased allele sharing in this region has also been reported in other independently ascertained pedigrees.3,4 The human IMPA2 gene, which encodes myo-inositol monophosphatase 2 (IMPA2)4 with 288 amino acids, was cloned from chromosome 18p11.2, a susceptibility region for bipolar disorder.5 It shares 54% amino acid identity to human myo-inositol monophosphatase 1 (IMPA1) (Fig. 1), and homology to the inositol monophosphatases of other organisms. Myo-inositol monophosphatase (EC 3.1.3.25) is an enzyme that dephosphorylates myo-inositol monophosphate to generate free myo-inositol. This enzymatic pathway is important in cellular functions since myo-inositol is a precursor of the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol (PI) (reviews9,10).

IMPA1. Here we report the crystal structures of human IMPA2 and discuss its structural aspects. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Expression and Purification The human IMPA2 cDNA, encoding human myo-inositol monophosphatase 2, was cloned into the modified pENTR vector with a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage site, derived from pENTR1A (Invitrogen). The expression vector pET44-TEV-IMPA2 was constructed using GATEWAY technology (Invitrogen) with pENTRTEV-IMPA2 and pET44-GATEWAY bearing a T7 promoter, an N-terminal NusA (Nus)-tag, a His-tag (pET-44a(þ), Novagen), and a GATEWAY reading frame cassette A (Invitrogen). The expression vectors of the proteins with a Histag, a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tag, a thioredoxin (Trx)-tag, and a maltose binding protein (MBP)-tag were constructed using GATEWAY technology in a similar way. The IMPA2 protein was expressed as a fusion with an Nterminal Nus-tag, a His-tag and a TEV protease cleavage site in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. The cells were disrupted by sonication in 20 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 500 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole. The protein was first purified by metal affinity chromatography on a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) with a linear gradient from 10 to 500 mM imidazole in 20 mM Tris­ HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 500 mM NaCl. The N-terminal-tag was cleaved by N-terminally His-tagged TEV protease (S219V)22 ($13 lg/mL) at 308C for 20 min and then at 48C for 16 h. The N-terminal-tag and the Histagged TEV protease were removed by chromatography on a HisTrap column. The protein was purified further by anion exchange chromatography on Mono Q column (GE Healthcare) with a linear gradient from 0 to 1M NaCl in 20 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM DTT, and was purified by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT. The yield of the purified IMPA2 protein was $5 mg from a 6 L culture. The construct that was used for crystallization contained the extra sequence, GGSHMELPGSS, at the N-terminus. Crystallization and Data Collection The crystallization screening of the IMPA2 protein was carried out using Crystal Screen, Crystal Screen 2, Index, SaltRx, Crystal Screen Cryo (Hampton Research), and Wizard I, II (Emerald BioStructures) crystal screening kits, by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method, at 208C. The preliminary crystals of IMPA2 were obtained under condition No. 42 (0.04M potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 16% PEG8000 and 20% glycerol) of the Crystal Screen Cryo crystal screening kit (Hampton Research) by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The crystallization conditions were refined further to obtain better crystals. The crystals of IMPA2 used for structure determination were obtained in drops, composed of 1 lL of 3­5 mg/mL protein solution (20 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing

ated derivatives (phosphatidylinositol phosphate; PIP) play crucial roles in intracellular signal transduction via the production of second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Lithium salts are effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder and have been shown to inhibit inositol monophosphatase activity (reviews10,11). Reduced mRNA expression of IMPA2 in lymphoblastoid cells12 from bipolar disorder patients was reported. A genetic association between IMPA2 promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and bipolar disorder, in Palestinian Arab13 and in Japanese (T. Ohnishi et al., in preparation), has also been detected. The evidence renders IMPA2 a tempting candidate gene in bipolar disorder. In addition, the region of chromosome 18p11.2 has been proposed to include a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia, and a significant association with GNAL (G-olfa) has been reported.14 GNAL and IMPA2 are in close physical proximity,15 and association studies suggested that IMPA2 may also contribute to a genetic risk for schizophrenia.16 Furthermore, a febrile seizure susceptibility locus on chromosome 18p11.2 was identified by a genomewide linkage screening, and a genetic association between IMPA2 and febrile seizure was detected.17 On the other hand, as for IMPA1, no genetic evidence has been demonstrated in mental disorders.13 Several functional and structural analyses of the human IMPA1 protein have been published (reviews9,10). The crystal structures of human IMPA1 were reported, and its enzymatic reaction mechanism was discussed.18­20 Although IMPA2 is an especially important target for neuropsychiatric illnesses, a structural and functional analysis of the IMPA2 protein has not been reported. Recently we characterized the enzymatic activity of IMPA2, revealing its distinct properties from IMPA1.21 To analyze the functional and structural details of human IMPA2, its structure should be determined and compared with that of

RESULTS Bacterial Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of Human IMPA2

R. ARAI ET AL.

To overexpress the IMPA2 protein in Escherichia coli, we tried to use fusion protein systems with several N-terminal tags, such as a His-tag, a GST-tag, a Trx-tag, a

MBP-tag, and a Nus-tag. The IMPA2 protein with the His-tag was not expressed. The fusion proteins with the GST-tag and the Trx-tag were both expressed, but were mostly insoluble. The IMPA2 fusion proteins with the MBP-tag and the Nus-tag were both highly expressed, and about half of the produced proteins were both obtained in the soluble fraction. We purified the IMPA2 fusion protein with the Nus-tag. The protein was first purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography, since the Nus-tag has an additional His-tag, and then the Nustag was cleaved by TEV protease. The protein was purified further by anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography steps. The highly purified protein, which was suitable for crystallization and other analyses, was obtained in a yield of $0.8 mg/L culture. The crystallization screening of the IMPA2 protein was carried out using several crystal screening kits by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The preliminary crystals of IMPA2 were obtained with a precipitant solution containing 40 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 16% PEG8000, and 20% glycerol at 208C. The crystallization conditions were further refined, and then several rod-like crystals (100­200 3 50­100 3 30­50 lm3), which were suitable for data collection, were obtained within about 2 weeks. Overall Structure of Human IMPA2 We determined the structures of four crystals of human IMPA2. The crystal structures were solved using the molecular replacement method with the crystal structure of human IMPA1 (PDB entry: 2HMM)20 as a search model. The crystallographic data are summarized in Table I. Crystals 1 and 2 were crystallized with the precipitant solutions containing 2 mM MgSO4, and they belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 and the trigonal space group P3121, respectively. In Crystal 1 (P212121), there are two IMPA2 monomers in the asymmetric unit, ° and the structure was refined to 2.7 A. In crystal 2 (P3121), there is one IMPA2 monomer in the asymmetric ° unit, and the structure was refined to 2.9 A. Crystal 3 was crystallized with a precipitant solution containing 5 mM LiCl, and belongs to the orthorhombic space group P212121. In crystal 3, there are two IMPA2 monomers in the asymmetric unit, and the structure was refined ° to 2.7 A. Crystal 4 was crystallized with a precipitant

solution containing 5 mM CaCl2, and belongs to the trigonal space group P3121. In the Crystal 4, there is one IMPA2 monomer in the asymmetric unit, and the struc° ture was refined to 3.0 A. The IMPA2 monomer comprises an a-b protein with a five-layered sandwich of a-helices and b-sheets (a-b-a-ba) [Fig. 2(A)]. There is one disulfide bond between Cys90 and Cys229; however it may be artifactual, since IMPA2 is an intracellular protein and disulfide bonds do not usually form in intracellular proteins in vivo. The overall structures of IMPA2 of the four crystals were almost the same, except for the a4 helix and some loop regions [Fig. 2(B)]. The angles of the a4 helix were slightly different between the orthorhombic crystals and the trigonal crystals, probably due to crystal packing effects. In Crystals 1 and 3, with the orthorhombic space group P212121, chains A (red) and B (green) in the asymmetric unit form a dimer [Fig. 2(C)]. In Crystals 2 and 4, with the trigonal space group P3121, the two A chains dimerize by the crystallographic two-fold symmetry axis, similar to the dimerization in the orthorhombic crystals [Fig. 2(D)]. According to the analytical ultracentrifugation, the molecular weight of IMPA2 was 64.9 kDa [Fig. 3(A)], indicating that the IMPA2 protein exists as a dimer in solution, since the molecular weight of the IMPA2 monomer with the additional sequences was 32.4 kDa. The dimer interface is predominantly hydrophobic, with principal dimerization contacts involving several hydrophobic clusters [Fig. 3(B,C)]. The residues involved in these interactions include Leu183, Leu187, Met190, Leu194, Val201 and Val203, and Phe113, Leu169, Ile204, and the aliphatic moieties of His111 and Arg202. The dimer interface is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the main chain atoms of Val203-Val203, and between the side chain atoms of His111-Asp220 and Asn108-Arg202.

relatively low magnesium ion concentration, and the magnesium ion concentration required for enzymatic activity in IMPA2 was higher than that in IMPA1.21 In crystal 2 (P3121, 2 mM MgSO4), a water molecule was located near the active site instead of a phosphate, and there was also no magnesium ion [Fig. 4(B)]. In the structure of crystal 3 (P212121, 5 mM LiCl), there are some waters in the active site [Fig. 4(C)]. Lithium ion is an uncompetitive inhibitor for inositol monophosphatase. The site of the lithium ion was unclear, since a lithium ion has only two electrons and therefore is virtually invisible in an X-ray crystallographic experiment. In crystal 4 (P3121, 5 mM CaCl2) of IMPA2, two calcium ions and one phosphate ion are bound to the active site of the IMPA2 monomer [Fig. 4(D)]. Calcium ion is a competitive inhibitor with respect to magnesium ion. Cal° cium ion 1 is located 2.0­2.4 A from the carboxylates of Glu81 and Asp101, and the carbonyl of Ile103. Calcium ° ion 2 is located 2.5­2.7 A from the carboxylates of Asp101, Asp104, and Asp231. The phosphate is located ° with oxygen O2, 2.3 A from both calcium ions, and oxy° from calcium ion site 1. gen O3, 2.1 A

Comparison of the Human IMPA2 and IMPA1 Structures The superimposition of the main chain structures of human IMPA2 (crystal 4) and IMPA1 (PDB entry: 1IMD)18 is shown in Figure 5(A). The overall structure of IMPA2 is remarkably similar to that of IMPA1, except for some loop ° regions (RMSD ¼ 1.21 A over 242 Ca atoms (chain A)). The superimposition of the active site regions of IMPA2 (crystal 4) with those of IMPA1 (PDB entry: 1IMD),18 complexed with manganese and phosphate ions, indicated that the binding sites of the two calcium and one phosphate ions of IMPA2 and their ligand residues in the proteins were almost the same sites as in IMPA1 complexed with the two manganese and one phosphate ions [Fig. 5(B)], indicating that the recognition mechanism of the metal ions in IMPA2 is the same as that in IMPA1. Figure 5(C) shows the surface representation of IMPA2 (crystal 4) and IMPA1 (PDB entry: 1IMA)19 in the entrance of the active site cavity. The complex of IMPA1 with the substrate indicated that the size of the active site cavity was suitable for myo-inositol-1-monophosphate. On the other hand, the active site cavity of IMPA2 was opened widely and laterally. In IMPA1, the loop region (31­43) is located at the entrance of the active site cavity [Fig. 5(D)]. In the corresponding region of IMPA2 (crystal 4), the residues 42­45 are disordered and the residues 46­54 form an a-helix [Fig. 5(D,E)]. In IMPA1, the important interactions at the loop region are the hydrophobic interactions

Active Site Region of Human IMPA2 In human IMPA1, the active site region consists of Glu70, Asp90, Ile92, Asp93, Asp220, and two or three magnesium ions.18,31,32 A sequence comparison between human IMPA1 and IMPA2 (Fig. 1) revealed that the corresponding residues of the IMPA2 active site are Glu81, Asp101, Ile103, Asp104, and Asp231. The structure of the active site of IMPA2 in the crystal 1 (P212121, 2 mM MgSO4) and the composite-annealed omit electron density map are shown in Figure 4(A). Although magnesium ions are required for the enzymatic activity of IMPA131,33,34 and IMPA2,21 an electron density for a magnesium ion was not found. There is an electron density, which is probably a phosphate ion, near the active site region. Some reasons why the magnesium ion was not found might be that the crystallization conditions involved a low pH and a

between Met31 and Phe98, and between Leu35 and Leu42, which contribute to the structural stability [Fig. 5(D)]. The residues Met31 and Leu35 in IMPA1 are replaced with Lys42 and Thr46 in IMPA2, respectively, suggesting that the interactions of IMPA2 are weaker than those of IMPA1, and consequently this region of IMPA2 forms a different structure from that of IMPA1.

DISCUSSION The structural conservation of the active site region with the two metals and one phosphate binding sites between IMPA2 and IMPA1 [Fig. 5(B)] suggests that the enzymatic reaction of IMPA2 involves two metal ions, in the same way as IMPA1.18,31 Recently, the high resolution structure of bovine inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) was reported, and the three-metal mechanism was proposed.32 The coordination sphere of the metal at Site 3 consists of a single protein ligand (Glu70 in bovine

IMPase) and five water molecules.32 Since the ligand residue (Glu81) is conserved in IMPA2, it is conceivable that a third metal is located at Site 3 at higher metal concentrations. The reaction mechanism can be estimated, in a similar way as for human IMPA118,31 and/or bovine IMPase,32 as follows: The enzyme catalyzes phosphate ester hydrolysis by promoting the attack of a metalbound water, which binds to Mg2þ-1 (and Mg2þ-3), on the phosphate group of the substrate. The metal-coordinated water nucleophile becomes activated by hydrogen-bonding interactions with Thr106. Asp101, Asp104, and Asp231 form a second metal binding site, from which Mg2þ-2 would coordinate the ester oxygen and stabilize the development of a negative charge as the phosphate ester is cleaved. The difference in the opening of the active site cavity suggests that the substrate specificity differs between IMPA1 and IMPA2 [Fig. 5(C)]. The widely opened cavity of the IMPA2 active site region, which is unfavorable for inositol phosphate, implies that the physiological substrate may be a larger derivative of inositol monophosphate. The phophatase activity of IMPA2 with myo-inositol-1-monophosphate and myo-inositol-4-monophosphate as substrates were indeed weaker than those of IMPA1.21 We speculated that one possible substrate may be phosphatidylinositol (PI) phosphate derivatives. However, the enzymatic assays with PI-3-P1, PI-4-P1, and PI-3,4-P2 indicated that both IMPA2 and IMPA1 lacked hydrolysis activity with these substrates.21 Although the physiological substrate(s) and optimal reaction conditions of IMPA2 still remain elusive, the current structural information could greatly foster resolving these issues. Several polymorphisms in IMPA2 have been identified in the screening of bipolar disorder,15,35 schizophrenia,13 and febrile seizure patients.17 To date, three missense mutations of IMPA2 have been reported: 468C > T (His76Tyr),15 443G > A (Arg148Gln),35 and 784C > T (Ala181Val).16 The sites of the missense mutation residues are located on the surface regions, as shown in Figure 6. Since His76 is located on the surface, the hypothesis that the Tyr mutation site is possibly phosphorylated16 may be conceivable.

CRYSTAL STRUCTURE OF HUMAN IMPA2

741

The Arg148Gln mutation changes the electrostatic surface potential and the Ala181Val mutation increases the hydrophobicity at the surface, suggesting that the mutations affected the stability and solubility of the protein. CONCLUSION In this work, we showed the crystal structures of human IMPA2 and its complex with calcium and phosphate ions. The overall structure of IMPA2 is similar to that of IMPA1, except for the loop regions. The structural difference in the opening of the active site cavity suggests that the substrate specificity differs between IMPA1 and IMPA2. The structure of IMPA2 complexed with calcium and phosphate ions revealed two metals and one phosphate binding sites, which were the same sites as in IMPA1 complexed with manganese and phosphate ions, suggesting that the mechanism of the enzymatic reaction is similar to that of IMPA1. The present study will contribute toward further functional analyses of IMPA2, the putative susceptibility gene for bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and febrile seizures, and designing an inhibitor for IMPA2, a potential drug candidate for these diseases.
