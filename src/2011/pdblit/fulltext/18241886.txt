Thioredoxins (Trxs) are small oxidoreductases that are involved in redox homeostasis and are found in large numbers in the subcellular compartments of eukaryotic plant cells, including the chloroplasts. Also present in chloroplasts are two forms of thioredoxin reductase (TR), which use either NADPH or ferredoxin as an electron donor. In other compartments, two additional TR forms also use NADPH: one is distributed in all photosynthetic organisms and is similar to prokaryotic enzymes, whereas the other is restricted to algae and is similar to mammalian selenoproteins. Here, we review current knowledge of the different forms of TRs across organisms and discuss the possible evolutionary fate of this class of enzymes, which provide an example of convergent functional evolution. Thioredoxin isoforms in plants: their subcellular localization and mode of reduction Thioredoxins (Trxs) are small oxidoreductases that are involved in the redox homeostasis of the cell and have a high catalytic activity for dithiol disulfide exchange reactions [1]. These reactions are essential for many cellular processes, including the regulation of Calvin cycle enzymes by light [1,2]. Unlike non-photosynthetic organisms, eukaryotic plants contain a large number of Trx isoforms located in several subcellular compartments, including the cytosol, mitochondria, chloroplasts (plastids) and nuclei [3­6]. Recent phylogenetic analyses have classified plant Trxs into 15 categories, and 49 and 41 genes of Trx and Trxlike sequences have been found in Populus trichocarpa and Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively [7]. Chloroplasts and plastids contain the f-, m-, x-, y- and chloroplast droughtinduced stress protein (CDSP)32-type Trxs; h-type Trxs are present in cytosol and mitochondria; and o-type Trxs are present only in mitochondria [3,4]. The f-, m- and h-type Trxs, as well as several of their target proteins, have been characterized structurally up to the 3D level [8­ 10]. By contrast, other plant Trxs, such as Clot, HCF164 (high chlorophyll fluorescence 164), nucleoredoxin, Trxlike type and lilium-type Trxs, are as yet uncharacterized [7]. The reasons for the expansion of Trx and Trx-like sequences in plants compared with other living organisms

are still uncertain but could be related to the increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) linked to the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and also to genome duplications in terrestrial plants [4]. Because plants contain many Trxs in different subcellular compartments, several reduction systems are also present in those compartments. Chloroplasts contain two thioredoxin reductases (TRs). The first, ferredoxin:thioredoxin reductase (FTR), is a heterodimer with an iron­sulfur (Fe­S) center and a disulfide that is reduced by ferredoxin (Fdx) [10]. The second, NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase (NTR) of chloroplasts (NTRC), is reduced by NADPH and is a fusion between a TR module and a Trx module [11,12]. In cytosol and mitochondria of higher plants, the reducing system is NADPH dependent, and, like NTRC, prokaryotic-type NTR contains a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor and a disulfide at the active site [13]. In addition, diatoms, haptophytes and most green algae have an elongated form of NTR, similar to the mammalian NTRs, which contains a FAD and a selenosulfide active site [14,15]. Trxs constitute a prototype of small oxidoreductases with a specific fold and a conserved active site (WCGPC, with some variations) [1]. They have given rise to a variety of related macromolecules with similar architecture but with different active sites, namely glutaredoxins (Grxs, typically with a YCPYC active site, with many variations) and protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs, classically with a WCGHC active site) [16,17]. Grxs and PDIs have less electronegative redox potentials than do Trxs and are involved in different reactions, such as deglutathionylation and protein folding, respectively [18]. Interestingly, Grxs are generally reduced via glutathione (GSH), the reduction of which is maintained by glutathione reductase (GR) and NADPH. Structural analyses have revealed that NTRs and GRs have high homology at the structural level, although they are not closely related at the primary sequence level [19]. Here, we review current knowledge about the different forms of TRs across photosynthetic organisms. In addition, by analyzing the arrangement of genes encoding TR and redoxins (Trxs, Grxs, Fdxs and peroxiredoxins [Prxs]) in prokaryote genomes and the existence of genes encoding fusion proteins between TR and redoxins both in

prokaryote and eukaryote genomes, we also discuss the possible evolutionary fate of this class of enzymes. We argue that the differences in the 3D structures of the four types of TR found in photosynthetic organisms provide an example of convergent functional evolution. Genome arrangement analyses and substrate specificity of thioredoxin reductases To obtain a functional view of TRs in photosynthetic organisms, we looked at TR representatives and at the distribution and organization of TR genes in all sequenced prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Using the `Protein Clusters' tool available through the NCBI homepage, 2243 prokaryotic genomes were analyzed, whereas eukaryotic genomes were searched by using blast analyses. We focused our analysis on genes encoding all types of NTR and the catalytic subunit of FTR (FTRc) that were either fused or adjacent to genes encoding proteins of the redoxin family (Trx, Grx, Fdx or Prx). In most organisms, Trx and TR are encoded by separate genes found at distant positions, but the genomic data highlighted novel and diversified organizations of TRs (Figure 1). Some of these genomic associations are consistent with recent biochemical and functional studies in plants, which have demonstrated that the Trx- and Grx-reducing systems are not independent pathways, as was initially believed [20,21]. In particular, this analysis sheds light on how the TRs evolved and why some of them can reduce Grxs or oxidized glutathione (GSSG). FTRc genes are only found in photosynthetic organisms and, in eukaryotic photosynthetic cells, the protein is restricted to plastids such as chloroplasts or amyloplasts [22,23]. Some bacterial and archaeal phyla contain a FTRclike protein similar to the catalytic subunit of FTR [24,25]. In terrestrial plants, green algae and diatoms, the gene is nuclear encoded and the protein has a chloroplastic-targeting sequence that is absent in cyanobacterial and plastidencoded isoforms from red algae [26]. Although FTRs are known to reduce plastidial Trxs, the particular gene organizations found in some prokaryotes suggest that alternative targets exist. For example, in some organisms, such as Desulfotalea psychrophila, the FTRc-like gene is fused to Grx or NrdH genes (the latter encoding a Grx-like protein that was identified first as a component of the bacterial ribonucleotide reductase operon [Nrd]), whereas in some proteobacteria and archaea, the FTRc-like gene is separated from these genes by a few nucleotides (Figure 1). Moreover, in some organisms belonging to the Euryarchaeota or Chloroflexi phyla, the FTRc-like protein is longer and exhibits, in addition to the three CxC motifs, a rubredoxin (Rbx) domain at the C terminus with five additional conserved Cys forming two CxxC motifs. It is still uncertain whether these motifs are reduced by the FTRc-like module. Collectively, these data suggest that a functional linkage occurs between FTRc and Grxs or Rbxs in organisms that contain these proteins. This is supported by recent biochemical evidence showing that an intramolecular disulfide bridge, which formed during the normal catalytic cycle of a Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Grx that exhibited a monothiol active site with a CGFS sequence, was reduced by FTR [27].

Finally, two selenoFTR sequences from unidentified microbial marine organisms, with one or two selenoCys (SeCys) residues instead of Cys in the CxC motifs, have been identified among selenoprotein-encoding sequences collected as part of the GOS (Global Ocean Sampling) project [28]. Given that most selenoprotein-rich samples belong to a marine environment associated with high temperatures (25 8C), rather than to a marine environment associated with lower temperatures (12 8C) or to a non-marine environment, it has been proposed that the former condition favors selenium utilization. The identification of these two selenoFTR sequences leads to the question of which, out of the SeCys- and the Cys-containing FTRs, was the prototypic protein? Because life appeared in water, we can hypothesize that the subsequent passage to terrestrial life led to the replacement of the selenoproteins by Cys-containing proteins. Alternatively, selenoFTR might have been selected from Cys-containing proteins in specific environments, such as those found in warm oceans. The same questioning might also be true for selenoNTRs, because they are found specifically in algae, including most marine algae sequenced so far (Figure 1). Although it is evident from phylogeny studies and sequence analyses that small and large NTRs and FTRs have followed separate evolutionary pathways, some TR members from each type can reduce Grxs [14,27,29­33]. Indeed, although the presence of Grx or Grx-like proteins in the genomes of organisms lacking GR or GSH, including Archaea, strongly suggests that Grxs could react with either type of TRs, biochemical evidence for the reduction of Grxs by TRs has been obtained in recent years, even in organisms with GSH biosynthetic and recycling pathways. NrdH and Grxs of the monothiol (CxxS) and dithiol (CxxC) types from unrelated organisms can be regenerated by TRs [27,29­33]. In addition, the existence of functional Grx­TR hybrid proteins, called Trx glutathione reductases (TGRs), supports these observations [34]. Specific Trxs and Grxs are likely to have evolved from a common ancestor from which the GSH-dependent Grxs were derived by the acquisition of a GSH-binding site [29]. Hence, we can hypothesize that intermediate situations exist: some Grxs have acquired the residues involved in GSH binding but conserved the possibility to be reduced by TRs. Another possibility for Trx reduction exists in some organisms, given that genetic and biochemical approaches have shown that Trxs can be reduced through the GR­GSH­Grx system [20,35]. Structural and functional properties of FTR FTR is a 20- to 25-kDa ab-heterodimer composed of one variable and one catalytic subunit. The size of the variable subunit ranges from 7 to 13 kDa in different species, and their primary structures also differ significantly (<15% identical residues within terrestrial plants) [2,24]. Except when fused to a Grx or Rbx domain, the size of the catalytic subunit is constant (13 kDa), and its primary structure is highly conserved (>55% identical residues within terrestrial plants), including six Cys organized in two CPC and one CHC motifs. Four of these Cys ligate the Fe­S cluster and the remaining two form the adjacent redox-active disulfide bridge of the active site [36].

Small NTRs and FTRs are encoded by a single gene in most prokaryotes and eukaryotes and can be either far apart in the genome or separated by only 1­150 nucleotides from genes encoding redoxin proteins (e.g. Trx, Grx, Fdx or Prx). These genes are likely to form operons, and this organization suggests that the proteins are functionally linked. In addition, some TR genes (encoding either small or large NTRs and

The two subunits also differ at the level of their 3D structure [37]. The variable subunit is an open b-barrel structure, whereas the catalytic subunit is an a-helical structure sitting on top of the variable subunit (Figure 2a). Together, the two subunits form a thin, concave,

highly conserved and ideally suited for simultaneous docking of a negatively charged Fdx on the cluster side and different Trxs on the disulfide side [38]. The main function of the variable subunit seems to be the stabilization of the catalytic subunit, particularly of its active site region. This has been deduced from observations that the catalytic subunit cannot be expressed alone [2,39]. By contrast, the catalytic subunit functions to transform an electron signal (Fdx) into a dithiol signal (Trx). Given that Trx reduction requires two electrons and Fdx is a oneelectron donor, a two-step mechanism has been proposed involving a one-electron reduced intermediate: a transient covalent complex between FTR and Trx [40,41]. This reaction mechanism suggests simultaneous interaction of FTR with both Fdx and Trx. Experimental evidence has been obtained for all protein complexes proposed in the reaction scheme [42,43], and their structures have been solved by using X-ray crystallography [38] and NMR [44]. The results show that Fdx and Trx dock on opposite sides of the FTR and that all intermolecular interactions occur exclusively with the catalytic subunit (see the FTR­ Trx complex in Figure 3a). Structural and functional properties of short NTRs The short NTRs are homodimers with subunits of 320 residues that contain a redox-active CxxC motif. The plant NTRs are homologous to prokaryotic NTRs (the A. thaliana NTR [AtNTRB] has 45% sequence identity with the Escherichia coli NTR). As expected, the plant NTR 3D structure is similar to that of prokaryotic enzymes, such as that of E. coli [45]. The NTR subunit is divided by a cleft into two similar a/ b-domains: one that binds FAD and one that binds NADPH (Figure 2b). The redox-active disulfide is located in the NADPH domain and is in close contact with the isoalloxazine moiety of FAD in the A. thaliana NTR structure [45]. A mechanism for the reduction cycle has been determined for E. coli NTR, which involves conformational changes to enable NADPH to reduce FAD. FAD then reduces the disulfide, followed by a large domain rotation to enable reduction of Trx by a disulfide­dithiol exchange reaction [46­48]. Based on the sequence identity and structure similarity between plant and E. coli NTRs, a similar mechanism should be relevant for plant NTRs. Properties of elongated selenoNTRs All enzymes belonging to the large TR subgroup display a CxxxxC motif that is involved in the reversible formation of a disulfide. The selenoNTRs also contain a SeCys (U) in their C-termini as a CU motif, explaining the broader substrate specificity of these enzymes [49]. Because SeCys is a more reactive nucleophile than Cys and also has a lower pKa, the selenoNTRs are likely to be more efficient reductases than Cys-containing NTRs, although the introduction of a SeCys residue instead of the regular Cys into Drosophila TR did not confirm this assumption [49]. However, the so-called large or elongated NTRs are represented by four types of molecular organization; the differences concern the presence of SeCys, the size of the proteins and the catalytic motifs present in N- and C-termini (Figure 1). NTRs from the Apicomplexa (first type) exhibit a second

CxxxxC motif in the C-terminal part instead of the more traditional CC motif found in Insecta (second type) or CU motif found in Mammalia, Algae, Platyhelmintha, Cnidaria and Chordata (third type). Furthermore, although mammals have one to three TR genes, a larger diversity compared with other organisms might occur owing to the existence of several alternatively spliced isoforms [50]. Owing to alternative splicing, some mammalian TR isoforms, referred to as TR1, can contain an N-terminal

Grx domain fused to the selenoNTR module, making them similar in domain organization to the TGR (alternatively named TR2) isoforms (fourth type) [50]. Nevertheless, although this Grx domain prevents full TR activity in TR1 proteins, in TGR, it enables TR, GR and Grx activity to be displayed [34,50]. A Drosophila TR, which does not contain the Grx module, also exhibits GR activity [51]. The 3D structures of mammalian selenoTRs have been determined; most recently, the structure of SeCys-containing human and rat enzymes was solved [52,53]. The selenoTRs differ in structure from the small TRs and have an extra dimerization domain as GRs. The selenenylsulfide at the C terminus is first reduced by the CxxxxC motif in the FAD domain of the other subunit of the homodimer and then itself reduces Trx. The selenoNTR from C. reinhardtii is homologous to the mammalian enzymes and has a sequence identity of >50%, thus allowing modeling (Figure 2c). In this model, the human and algal TRs differ in chain length at two places. The C. reinhardtii TR is four residues shorter than the human TR in a loop at the surface of the NADP domain in the only place where sequence identity is low. The other difference is a loop in the dimerization domain that is eight residues longer in algal TR than in mammalian TR. Properties of NTRC The sequencing of many prokaryote and eukaryote genomes reveals diversified gene organization linked to putative redox pathways used by these organisms. It was shown first in mycobacteria that at least three different gene organizations exist within a single bacterial genus [54]. In most mycobacterial strains, the two genes, encoding Trx and TR, are located in separate regions of the genome, but in pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, both genes are found on the same locus, overlapping by one nucleotide (the Trx gene being systematically in the 30 part of NTR); finally, in Mycobacterium leprae, TR and Trx are encoded by a single gene encoding a functional fusion protein [54]. NTRC is present in photosynthetic organisms and is an analog of the M. leprae TR­Trx fusion protein [11]. This chloroplastic protein seems to be dedicated to the reduction of 2-Cys Prx types. A similar organization is also found in some bacterial species for proteins called AhpF (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit F)-like proteins (Figure 1). Although AhpF-like proteins and NTRC have a similar domain organization, the former is larger by 100 amino acids; in addition, based on our phylogenetic analysis of all small NTRs, they do not have a common origin and seem to have evolved separately (data not shown). The opposite situation also exists; that is, a Trx gene situated only a few base pairs away in the 50 part of the NTR gene or fused to it. The latter bacterial proteins are called AhpF and are also devoted to the reduction of Prxs called AhpC. In many cases, in addition to a Trx or Grx gene, there is a gene encoding a Prx or a glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) on either side of the small TR gene, especially in Clostridiaceae (Figure 1). In several organisms, it has been shown that the AhpF­AhpC couple, or more generally the TR­Trx­Prx system, is an important

NADH- or NADPH-dependent pathway for peroxide degradation [30,55]. A similar variety of gene organization is found for small NTRs and Grx and NrdH in Clostridiaceae and Thermotogae or between small NTRs and Fdx in other bacterial species (Figure 1). In these cases, the redoxin gene is never fused to the TR gene but it is situated a few base pairs away, either in the 50 or the 30 part of the TR gene. In Thermotogae, there is one gene encoding a protein composed of two Grx modules with putative CPYC or CQYC active sites. It has been demonstrated in an archaean, Pyrococcus horikoshii, that this protein accepts electrons from a TR homolog [56]. Surprisingly, the TR genes situated close to Fdx genes do not have the CxxC redox motif that is characteristic of small NTRs, suggesting that electrons can be transferred directly from the FAD moiety of NTR to the Fe­S cluster of Fdx or in the opposite direction, depending on the redox potential of these cofactors. Although not located in the proximity of an Fdx gene, this type of NTR gene is found in other prokaryotes, suggesting that this pathway is conserved in several microorganisms. The structural model and amino acid comparisons have shown that the small NTR in NTRC is connected to the Trx domain by a linker of 20 residues at the C terminus of the NADP domain (Figure 2d). Modeling of NTRC positions the Trx domain closer to the active site of the second subunit of the dimer, which is probably the active form of NTRC [12], creating the possibility of a catalytic crosstalk between the subunits. Alternatively, because part of the protein is also found in a monomeric form, we cannot exclude that a large conformational rearrangement brings the Trx domain close to the dicysteine motif of NTRC, with subsequent intramolecular electron transfer, but a more thorough investigation is needed to elucidate this point. Convergent structural evolution of thioredoxin reductases There are several examples of enzymes or proteins with the same function but unrelated primary sequences and 3D structures, as exemplified by the type A and B methionine sulfoxide reductases [57]. This is also the case for Trx reduction in plants, where the reduction of the redox-active disulfide or selenylsulfide of the small or large TR is achieved by NADPH-FAD in NTR and by Fdx through an Fe­S center in FTR. In FTR, this center is in close contact with the disulfide and, in NTR, the isoalloxazine ring of FAD is in close contact with the disulfide or selenylsulfide. Although FTR has a different structure from that of all forms of NTR, both reduce Trxs. This is a clear case of convergent functional evolution. There is also a striking difference between how the two forms of TR interact with Trxs. For FTR, the binding of Trx can be achieved without any significant perturbations of the protein structure (Figure 3a). For NTR, as demonstrated structurally for the short E. coli NTR, the NADPH domain, which contains the redox-active Cys, has to make a large rotation to be able to contact and reduce Trx (Figure 3b) [48]. The different NTRs have a complex evolutionary history. The structures of the NADPH and FAD domains of the short NTR are similar to those of GR and elongated

Box 1. FTR and NTR analysis: an example of the limits and wonders of computational and structural biology
Without the biochemical background acquired during the late 1970s and early 1980s showing that FTR is a heterodimer [22], computational analysis of the conserved FTR catalytic subunit using the STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) database (http://string.embl.de/) [58] would fail to detect the interaction of the catalytic subunit with the variable subunit. This is because the two genes are never fused and have never been found to be clustered in any sequenced genome. However, this interaction is essential for the formation of the functional heterodimer in photosynthetic organisms. Likewise, with present tools, determination of the 3D structure of FTR would have failed to assign it a TR fold or function if analyzed in the absence of the known biochemical background. However, when the structure is analyzed with the previous knowledge that FTR and NTR both catalyze the reduction of Trx, the structural homologies become apparent, that is, the similar relative positions of the disulfide and Fe­S center or FAD and the formation of a large groove forming a Trx-binding site in both proteins. Trx and Grx also have a similar fold and molecular volume, and this supports the possibility that TRs can also reduce Grxs. The analysis of putative FTR partners using the STRING web-tool indicates that this reductase and Grxs are indeed associated, supporting some biochemical observations and confirming that the Trx and Grx pathways are interconnected rather than independent. The presence of the FTR catalytic subunit, as detected by computational biology, in some archaeans and bacterial species indicates that the function of this protein is not restricted to light regulation of photosynthetic enzymes. It is thus likely that, in these organisms, another reduction pathway is used, and a pathway via NADPH, Fdx-NADP oxidoreductase and Fdx is the most probable, as has been proposed for Trx reduction in amyloplasts [23]. In addition, the apparent absence of the variable subunit also suggests that the protein has a simpler organization and structure in these moreprimitive, non-photosynthetic organisms.

chloroplasts or plastids that do not exist in mammalian cells. By contrast, the extended selenoTR, which is similar to that of mammalian systems, has clearly been lost during the evolution of plants, being present in algae but absent in terrestrial plants. Another important feature is the relative versatility of some TRs, some of which are able to reduce both Trxs and Grxs. This observation suggests that there is a delicate interplay among these redox systems in photosynthetic cells that deserves future investigation.

selenoNTR. However, compared with short NTR, there is an extra dimerization domain that creates a different dimeric structure in both large NTRs and GRs. In addition, the catalytically active disulfides are located in the FAD domain in large NTRs but in the NADPH domain in short NTRs and on the opposite side of the isoalloxazine moiety. Their catalytic mechanism is also different due to the involvement of SeCys. The differences between small and large NTRs or GRs in primary sequences, in 3D structures and in reaction mechanisms might thus also represent another example of convergent evolution [19]. It has been suggested that the large NTR originated from a prokaryote GR that developed a C-terminal extension containing the SeCys [14]. Finally, the FTR and NTR analysis proposed here is a demonstration of the need to carry on with experimental biology to confirm and extend suggestions based on computational analyses. We detail in Box 1 how biochemical experiments are a necessary complement to computational and structural biology analyses. Concluding remarks Trxs and their next of kin Grxs are present as expanded multigene families in photosynthetic organisms and most notably in terrestrial plants, which have over 30 genes for each category compared with less than ten in non-photosynthetic organisms. This expansion is accompanied by a diversification of TRs with two additional forms in the
