Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are recommended components of preferred combination antiretroviral therapies used for the treatment of HIV. These regimens are extremely effective in suppressing virus replication. Structure-based optimization of diaryl ether inhibitors led to the discovery of a new series of pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridazine NNRTIs that bind the reverse transcriptase enzyme of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-RT) in an expanded volume relative to most other inhibitors in this class. The binding mode maintains the 13 and 14 strands bearing Pro236 in a position similar to that in the unliganded reverse transcriptase structure, and the distribution of interactions creates the opportunity for substantial resilience to single point mutations. Several pyrazolopyridazine NNRTIs were found to be highly effective against wild-type and NNRTI-resistant viral strains in cell culture.
Introduction Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors bind to an induced hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the polymerase active site of HIV-reverse transcriptase and prevent the progression of DNA synthesis from the viral RNA template.1 Clinical studies have demonstrated that therapy with a combination of NNRTIsa and nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors is able to provide a sustained reduction of viral replication in treatment-naive patients.2 Nevertheless, a single nucleotide mutation in the HIV-genome can produce a virus that is highly resistant to NNRTIs, and treatment failure is often accompanied by the emergence of resistant viruses.3 Many research groups have therefore attempted to discover new NNRTIs that inhibit commonly observed NNRTI-associated resistant viruses and that have a higher genetic barrier to resistance.4-6 Binding of NNRTIs to HIV-RT is thought to restrict the motion of key residues in the polymerase active site and prevent incorporation of nucleotides into the DNA chain during reverse transcription.7 The reverse transcriptase enzyme is very flexible, and lead optimization using structure-based drug design and computational analysis of ligand affinity is complicated by the dynamic nature of the induced ligand binding site.8-10 Relative to the apo enzyme, NNRTI-bound reverse transcriptases show large conformational adjustments in backbone positions and side chain rotamers, particularly of Tyr181, Tyr183, and Tyr188, that create the NNRTI pocket (Figure 1).11,12 This induced

conformation also maintains a remarkable degree of plasticity, as the geometry and volume of the final protein pocket are sensitive to the shape and properties of the bound ligand. All NNRTIs form direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone of lysine residue Lys101 or Lys103.13 Inhibitors that maintain hydrogen bond interactions with Lys101 include efavirenz,14 etravirine,15 and trovirdine16 (Chart 1). In structures of most smaller K101-binding inhibitors, strands 13 and 14 (residues 232-241) are displaced relative to their position in the apo structure. Pro236, which is located on the intervening turn, translates approximately 3 Å.14 This movement allows for the formation of a direct hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of Pro236 and the Lys103 amide NH and provides favorable hydrophobic interactions between the aniline portion of the inhibitors and hydrophobic elements of the underlying shifted sheet (Figure 1b). Another class of NNRTIs contains a hydrogen bond acceptor that directly interacts with the Lys103 backbone NH. In addition to delavirdine, this group includes many "next-generation" inhibitors that maintain potency against the commonly observed Lys103Asn mutant virus.4,6 Structural analysis of these compounds bound to HIV-RT shows that the 13- 14 turn region is in a position similar to that found in the unliganded structure (Figure 1c). The inhibitors that interact with the backbone of Lys103 fill the space adjacent to the loop with functionality capable of maintaining substantial hydrophobic contacts with P236 and F227. For example, the investigational drug candidates 31 (GW678248)17 and 32 (RDEA806)18 contain an aromatic

amide functionality in which the amide portion of the inhibitor interacts with the Lys103 NH while the substituted phenyl group makes extensive hydrophobic contacts (Chart 2). In earlier studies of diaryl ether NNRTIs, we had discovered that triazolinones related to structure A are potent inhibitors of viral replication (Figure 2).19 Structural analysis revealed that the triazolinone ring simultaneously forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl and amide NH functionality of Lys103. Modeling of the triazolinones A and similar amide-based inhibitors B indicated that the amides made more extensive contact with the 13- 14 region. This observation led to the design of annulated pyrazole NNRTIs C, which should make hydrogen bonding interactions similar to those of the triazolinone while more effectively engaging in hydrophobic interactions with the distal portions of the 12- 14 sheet. In this paper, we describe the

discovery of annulated pyrazole NNRTIs that maintain excellent activity against wild-type and NNRTI-resistant viruses.20 Structural analysis reveals a distribution of significant interactions between the most potent inhibitors and HIV-RT. These contacts allow this class of compounds to inhibit a broad range of NNRTI-resistant viruses. Chemistry The synthesis of the diaryl ether NNRTIs commenced with a highly regioselective reaction between phenol and 2,3,4trifluoronitrobenzene as described in Scheme 1. A malonate addition/decarboxylation sequence allowed for the installation of the acetic acid ester group in good yield. Reduction of the nitro functionality and a Sandmeyer reaction with the resulting aniline gave ester 14. The ethyl ester could be converted to the corresponding tert-butyl ester 15 using standard procedures. The synthetic procedure used for the preparation of annulated pyrazole NNRTIs starting from 14 is exemplified for compound 4 in Scheme 2. In the key transformation, a Claisen condensation between an acylimidazole and the sodium enolate of ester 14 or 15 provided -ketoesters that could be decarboxylated and treated with hydrazine to provide the annulated pyrazole inhibitors. This route proved to be generally useful for the preparation of pyrazoles that contained different functionality on the annulated phenyl ring. The acid utilized for the preparation of pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridazines 6 and 8-10 was prepared in four steps starting from commercially available 3-carboxy-2,6-dichloropyridazine (Scheme 3). Similarly, pyrazolopyridone 3 was prepared employing acid 24 (synthesis

Results and Discussion The inhibitors 1-7 were evaluated in enzymatic and cellular assays using standard procedures, and the results are displayed in Table 1. Inhibition of HIV polymerase activity was initially assessed using purified recombinant wild-type or Lys103NAsn/ Tyr181Cys HIV polymerase and a poly(rA)/oligo(dT)16 templateprimer. The ability of the NNRTIs to reduce HIV replication in cell culture was determined in MT-4 cells using wild-type virus and clinically relevant mutant strains. Further details are provided in the Experimental Section. In order to test the hypothesis that annulated pyrazole compounds would be potent inhibitors of polymerase activity, compound 1 was initially prepared (Table 1). Modeling had suggested that the nitrile substituent of the indazole ring would emerge from the binding pocket through an opening that separates Lys104 and Pro225, and we were encouraged to find that this compound did exhibit strong inhibition of polymerase activity in the enzyme assay. Furthermore, 1 displayed good potency in the cellular antiviral assay. Replacement of the nitrile of the indazole ring with an amino group (2) or conversion of the indazole phenyl ring to a methylated pyridone (3) did not significantly alter activity against the wild-type or mutant viruses. Pyrazolopyridine 4, which contains a single nitrogen atom in the 7-position of the phenyl ring, had excellent activity in the cellular assay. This potency was maintained for regioisomer 5. Additional activity was gained for the pyrazolo[3,4c]pyridazine 6, which significantly inhibited virus replication at subnanomolar concentrations in the cellular assay. Isomeric

described in Scheme 4). The ester intermediate used for the synthesis of compound 10 was prepared in four steps as described in Scheme 5. A nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction between phenol 25 and fluorobenzene 26 provided the diaryl ether. Acetic acid ester 29 was prepared by reduction of the nitro group with iron, followed by a palladium-catalyzed reaction with 2-tert-butoxyethylzinc chloride. A Sandmeyer reaction was then used to install the desired halogen.

compounds in which the nitrogen atom in the 6-position was moved to other positions (e.g., 7) generally had inferior potency in the cellular assay, particularly in tests with the Lys103Asn/ Tyr181Cys mutant enzyme. The pyrazolopyridazine heterocycle found in inhibitor 6 was used to prepare a small family of NNRTIs (Chart 3). Compounds 8 and 9 were also found to maintain good potency against the wild-type and mutant viruses. Inhibitor 10, which was prepared in order to test the requirement for a meta disposition of the methylene and ether linkages about the central phenyl ring, had reasonable activity against the wild-type virus but did not inhibit the Lys103Asn/Tyr181Cys mutant at tested concentrations. Further investigation revealed that 10 also did not maintain good potency against the Lys103Asn or Tyr181Cys single mutant viruses (IC50(wt) ) 30 nM, IC50(Lys103Asn) ) 120 nM, IC50(Tyr181Cys) ) 800 nM). Compound 8, which had an excellent preliminary antiviral profile and moderate molecular weight (MW ) 415 Da), was selected for further profiling. Tests with a large panel of NNRTIresistant mutant viruses revealed that single nucleotide mutations of the wild-type virus do not significantly reduce the potency of this compound (Table 2). In particular, 8 strongly inhibits replication of the prevalent 103Asn, 181Cys, and 190Ala mutants. For comparison, data obtained with efavirenz are also shown. Inhibitor 8 was more potent than efavirenz against several NNRTI resistant mutants and the wild-type virus. The relative potencies of efavirenz and 8 in this assay against the Lys103Asn mutant were particularly striking. The potential of compound 8 to prevent the replication of NNRTI-resistant viruses that contain several mutations of the viral genome was assessed in testing against a panel of NNRTIresistant clinical isolates (Table 3). These viruses were selected (PhenoScreen, Monogram Biosciences) on the basis of their reduced susceptibility to efavirenz, and the diversity of viral isolates was chosen to represent the majority of NNRTI resistance patterns that have been described in clinical practice. Etravirine, which has shown excellent potency against NNRTIresistant viruses,15 was also tested for its ability to inhibit the

replication of the isolates. Compound 8 and etravirine were able to effectively inhibit a similar proportion of viruses in this panel (effective inhibition defined as (IC50 mutant)/(IC50 wild-type) < 10). Importantly, compound 8 maintained potency against all viruses that contained the common K103 and Y181 mutations. A substantial (>10-fold) reduction in potency was observed only for isolates that contain the Y188L/G190A and A98/V108/G190/F227 combination mutations. Pharmacokinetic profiling revealed that 8 is also stable in vivo (Table 4). This inhibitor had a moderate volume of distribution, and acceptable half-lives were observed in several preclinical species. The structures of compounds 6 and 10 bound to wild-type HIV-RT were solved in order to further understand the binding mode of the inhibitors to HIV-RT (Figures 3 and 4). As designed, the compounds induce the expanded NNRTI pocket where Pro236 and the flanking ends of strands 13 and 14 are in a position similar to that found in the apo structure. This configuration is stabilized by the pyrazolopyridazine moiety. The pyrazole makes hydrogen bonds to both the backbone amide and carbonyl of Lys103. The pyridazine extension parallels the face of Pro236 of the 13- 14 hairpin, and its amphipathic edges are well suited to the site: the hydrophobic edge faces the pocket interior, packing with Phe227 and Leu234, while the polar nitrogen atoms of the six-membered ring are exposed to solvent through one of the few openings of the highly buried cavity (Figure 5). The diaryl ether system of both 6 and 10 partly overlaps the "butterfly wing" binding region of the early NNRTIs,21 but the two inhibitors maintain markedly different angles through the ether linkage. Both 6 and 10 sit closer to strands 6 and 10 than most NNRTIs, which allows Tyr181 to remain in the general position it occupies in apo or DNA-bound RT structures.22,23 Concomitantly, Tyr188 rotates slightly to form aromatic stacking interactions with the terminal phenyl ring of the inhibitors. This portion of the molecule is also braced against the conserved Trp229 residue, and a distortion of strand 12 and the primer grip region similar to that observed in firstgeneration NNRTIs is achieved. The large bromine on the core ring of 6 fills the volume between Val106, Val179, Tyr181, and Tyr188, with closest approach (3.5 Å) to the backbone carbonyl of Tyr188, suggesting a favorable halogen-carbonyl interaction as seen in other recent examples.24 The primary difference between compounds 6 and 10 is the relative disposition of the substituents about the central phenyl ring (Figure 6). Compound 10 also extends more broadly across the binding pocket, reaching slightly closer to both Trp229 at the back of the pocket and Lys103 at the opposite side. While the amino acids on each end of the pocket shift outward slightly to accommodate the ligand, the tightness of fit and the lower potency of 10 compared to 6 suggests that the organization of the inhibitor may extend beyond the optimal size for the wild type pocket. The central phenyl ring of 10 is pivoted such that the bromine atom does not interact significantly with the Tyr188 carbonyl group and has fewer contacts in this hydrophobic subpocket. The central phenyl ring of 10 is also removed from the carbonyl group of K101 relative to the more potent inhibitor

Figure 3. Structure of compound 6 in the NNRTI binding pocket (3DYA). The diaryl ether fills the core hydrophobic pocket. The pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridazine forms hydrogen bonds to the backbone of K103 and stabilizes Pro236 in an apo-like position, creating an expanded pocket volume relative to efavirenz.

6. Many NNRTIs maintain a strong hydrogen bond donoracceptor relationship with the carbonyl group of Lys101, and it is possible that the CH-hydrogen bond through which 6 interacts with this moiety contributes to the activity of the inhibitor (Figure 3).25 As has been noted previously, NNRTI-resistant HIV-reverse transcriptases generally have an expanded pocket volume relative to the wild type enzyme.12 That is, the majority of NNRTI resistance-pathways involve the substitution of residues that make hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme inhibitor. As a consequence of the larger size of compound 6 and the expanded binding pocket that it induces in the reverse transcriptase enzyme, the interactions of this inhibitor are spread across a larger area of the protein than first generation NNRTIs. All portions of the molecule are making significant interactions with the enzyme, and no individual position appears to provide a majority of the interaction energy. This conclusion is supported by the observation that perturbation of the significant interactions

between the pyrazolopyridazine compounds and mutable residues such as Val106, Tyr188, and Phe227 does not significantly impact the inhibition potency. In addition, the architecture of 6 includes malleable linkages that allow for conformational and positional adjustment.26-28 As a consequence of the soft energy potentials around those connections, binding energy is lost as the compound adapts to the mutant protein's changed surface. Finally, specific polar interactions target invariant backbone atoms rather than mutable side chain groups. These motifs are again spread across the binding pocket and include traditional hydrogen bond interactions with the pyrazolopyridazine heterocycle, CH-hydrogen bond interactions of the central phenyl ring, and halogen-carbonyl interactions of the bromine atom. Some of these interactions are not observed in the structure of the enzyme complex with inhibitor 10, and their absence may contribute to the relatively poor potency of this inhibitor. Conclusions Structure-based design of novel inhibitors that interact with the K103 backbone of HIV-reverse transcriptase has led to the discovery of NNRTIs that contain an unusual 1H-pyrazolo[3,4c]pyridazine heterocycle. This heterocycle stabilizes a large binding pocket with many structural features less changed from the apoprotein conformation than seen in early NNRTIs. The optimized fit to this expanded pocket provides compounds that potently inhibit the replication of wild-type and NNRTI-resistant

RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity was measured using a biotinylated primer oligonucleotide and tritiated dNTP substrate. Newly synthesized DNA was quantified by capturing the biotinylated primer molecules on streptavidin coated scintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads (Amersham). The sequences of the polymerase assay substrate were as follows: 18nt DNA primer, 5-biotin/GTC CCT GTT CGG GCG CCA-3; 47nt RNA template, 5-GGG UCU CUC UGG UUA GAC CAC UCU AGC AGU GGC GCC CGA ACA GGG AC-3. The biotinylated DNA primer was obtained from the Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., and the RNA template was synthesized by Dharmacon. The DNA polymerase assay (final volume 50 µL) contained 32 nM biotinylated DNA primer, 64 nM RNA substrate, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP (each at 5 µM), 103 nM [3H]dATP (specific activity ) 29 µCi/mmol) in 45 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 45 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM Mg(CH3COO)2, 0.045% Triton X-100 w/v, 0.9 mM EDTA. The mixtures contained 5 µL of serial compound dilutions in 100% DMSO for IC50 determination, and the final concentrations of DMSO were 10%. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 30 µL of the HIV room temperature enzyme (final concentrations of 1-3 nM). Protein concentrations were adjusted to provide linear product formation for at least 30 min of incubation. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reaction was quenched by addition of 50 µL of 200 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and 2 mg/mL SA-PVT SPA beads (Amersham, RPNQ0009, reconstituted in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM EDTA, and 1% BSA). The beads were left to settle overnight, and the SPA signals were counted in a 96-well top counter-NXT (Packard). IC50 values were obtained by sigmoidal regression analysis using GraphPad. Antiviral Assay. Anti-HIV antiviral activity was assessed using an adaptation of the method of Pauwels et al.29 The method is based on the ability of compounds to protect HIV-infected T lymphoblastoid cells (MT4 cells) from cell death mediated by the infection. The end point of the assay was calculated as the concentration of compound at which the cell viability of the culture was preserved by 50% ("50% inhibitory concentration", IC50). The cell viability of a culture was determined by the uptake of soluble, yellow 3-[4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and its reduction to a purple insoluble formazan salt. After solubilization, spectrophotometric methods were employed to measure the amount of formazan product. MT4 cells were prepared to be in logarithmic-phase growth and a total of 2 × 106 cells infected with the HXB2-strain of HIV at a multiplicity of 0.0001 infectious units of virus per cell in a total volume of between 200 and 500 µL. The cells were incubated with virus for 1 h at 37 °C before removal of virus. The cells are then washed in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2, before being resuspended in culture medium for incubation in culture with serial dilutions of test compound. The culture medium used was RPMI 1640 without phenol red, supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, L-glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum (GM10).

Test compounds were prepared as 2 mM solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Four replicate, serial 2-fold dilutions in GM10 were then prepared and 50 µL amounts placed in 96-well plates over a final nanomolar concentration range of 625-1.22. Fifty microliters GM10 and 3.5 × 104 infected cells were then added to each well. Control cultures containing no cells (blank), uninfected cells (100% viability, four replicates), and infected cells without compound (total virus-mediated cell death, four replicates) were also prepared. The cultures were then incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air for 5 days. A fresh solution of 5 mg/mL MTT was prepared in 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2, and 20 µL added to each culture. The cultures were further incubated as before for 2 h. They were then mixed by pipetting up and down 170 µL of Triton X-100 in acidified isopropanol (10% v/v Triton X-100 in 1:250 mixture of concentrated HCl in isopropanol). When the formazan deposit was fully solubilized by further mixing, the absorbance (OD) of the cultures was measured at 540 and 690 nm wavelength (690 nm readings were used as blanks for artifacts between wells). The percent protection for each treated culture was then calculated from the equation

% protection ) {[(OD drug treated cultures) (OD untreated virus control cultures)] / [(OD uninfected cultures) (OD untreated virus control cultures)]} × 100%
The IC50 can be obtained from graph plots of percent protection versus log10 of the drug concentration. Antiviral Assay Using Clinical Isolates. Viruses were selected from a panel of clinical isolates available at Monogram Biosciences based on their reduced susceptibility to efavirenz. Compounds were evaluated in the PhenoScreen single cycle antiviral assay at Monogram Biosciences as described previously.29b Crystallization and Structure Determination. Amino acids 1-561 of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase were overexpressed in E. coli. Supernatant from disrupted and centrifuged cell pellet was passed over Q Sepharose, heparin HP, C3 HIC, SP Sepharose, and Superdex 200 SEC columns, concentrated to 12 mg/mL, and stored in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.8, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT at -80 °C. An aliquot of thus purified p66/p51 heterodimer reverse transcriptase was mixed with 0.4 mM 6 or 10. Crystals were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion over a reservoir of 1.15 M sodium malonate, 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 5% ethylene glycol. Crystals were exchanged into a cryoprotectant of 2 M sodium malonate, 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 0.5 M sodium ascorbate including 0.1 mM compound. Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen and data collected at the Advanced Light Source beamline 5.0.2 and Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 9.2. Data were reduced with HKL2000 and phased using coordinates from an internal structure (i.e., rigid-body refinement in Refmac rather than a full molecular replacement search). Model inspection, building, and refinement were done using PyMOL,30 COOT,31 and Refmac.32,33 Statistics and further details are included in the Supporting Information.
