Using heavily methionine-substituted T4 lysozyme as an example, it is shown how the addition or deletion of a small number of methionines can simplify the location of selenium sites for use in MAD phasing. By comparing the X-ray data for a large number of singly substituted lysozymes, it is shown that the optimal amino acid to be substituted by methionine is leucine, followed, in order of preference, by phenylalanine, isoleucine and valine. The identi®cation of leucine as the ®rst choice agrees with the ranking suggested by the Dayhoff mutation probability, i.e. by the frequency of amino-acid substitutions in the sequences of related proteins. The ranking of the second and subsequent choices, however, differ signi®cantly.

When a selenomethionine-substituted protein is used to facilitate X-ray structure determination (Hendrickson et al., 1990; Hendrickson, 1991), the ®rst requirement is to locate the positions of the Se atoms. Although increasingly powerful methods are becoming available (Weeks & Miller, 1999), this can become more dif®cult as the number of sites is increased and may be a limitation for larger proteins which contain many methionines or for cases in which there are several protein molecules in the asymmetric unit. The situation can be illustrated by a mutant of T4 lysozyme that contains a total of 12 methionines. It should be emphasized that the location of 12 Se atoms is by no means at the limit of present technology; a successful 70-site analysis has been reported (Deacon & Ealick, 1999). The lysozyme example is used because the data are available and serve to illustrate an approach which should be applicable in more demanding contexts. Five of the methionines present in the mutant lysozyme, Met1, Met6, Met102, Met106 and Met120, are present in the wild-type protein. The additional seven were introduced by the following site-directed substitutions: Leu843Met, Leu913Met, Leu993Met, Leu1183Met, Leu1213Met, Leu1333Met and Phe1533Met (Gassner et al., 1996). The Harker section of the Patterson map for this variant, calculated with the coef®cients (F12-SeMet À F12-Met)2, is shown in Fig. 1(a). Although there is reasonably good agreement between the locations of the expected vector peaks and those observed, the interpretation of such a map is complicated by peak overlap and by the weakness of some of the expected peaks. In such cases, one can obtain a much simpler starting point by engineering a related protein in which a small number of methionines have either been added or subtracted. This approach

can be illustrated by consideration of the 12-methionine and the 10-methionine lysozymes which are identical except for the Leu1333Met and Phe1533Met replacements. By combining the diffraction data for crystals of these two proteins, one can calculate a Patterson map with coef®cients (F12-SeMet À F10-SeMet)2 to give the result shown in Fig. 1(b). Here, the two highest peaks correspond to the expected vector peaks from the Se atoms at sites 133 and 153. The interpretation is straightforward and knowledge of these two sites can be used in the standard way to help locate the remaining Se atoms. Although the example uses isomorphous differences, the extension to use anomalous scattering or multiple-wavelength data is obvious. The approach can readily be generalized to mutants that include different numbers or combinations of methionine residues. Additionally, by using proteins that differ by a single methionine, the location of that amino acid in the unit call can be determined. Leahy et al. (1994) have previously shown how methionines can be engineered into a protein in order to assist in the determination of its structure. They also discussed a possible strategy for the selection of suitable sites of substitution. In selecting sites for either addition or subtraction of methionines, one wants to choose replacements that will not interfere with the growth of crystals, will leave the crystal structure as isomorphous as possible with the parent and will result in well ordered (i.e. non-mobile) sites. The obvious residues that suggest themselves for replacement with methionine are leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine and possibly valine. The ®rst three Ê have side-chain volumes of 76, 76 and 87 A3, respectively, which are comparable with that of Ê methionine (76 A3). The value for valine

Ê (57 A3) is somewhat lower (Creighton, 1993). Additionally, all such residues are likely to occupy internal sites within a protein (Rose et al., 1985), minimizing the chance of interfering with crystal contacts and maximizing the likelihood that the methionine introduced will be well ordered. In order to give possible guidance in the choice between the above alternatives, we have collected together in Table 1 the relevant statistics for all T4 lysozyme mutants in which methionines have been substituted at different sites in the protein. In all 19 examples, the side chain of the residue is at least 90% buried. The difference in structure amplitudes between wild-type lysozyme and a given methionine mutant, i.e. the isomorphous difference, will arise from three factors: (i) the difference in scattering between the methionine and the amino acid it replaces; (ii) non-isomorphism introduced by the substitution and (iii) errors in the data. Because each of the side chains involved scatters fairly weakly and, in any case, should be roughly comparable, at least for methionine, leucine, isoleucine and valine, we assume that the ®rst term can be ignored. The errors in the data can be estimated from Rmerge. Taking the average value of Rmerge (5.5%) and bearing in mind that it is calculated from intensities rather than structure amplitudes, the average contribution to the isomorphous difference from errors in the data can be estimated as about 0.055. Actually this is, if anything, an overestimate, since Rmerge is calculated to the limit of the data, whereas the isomorphous difference is calculated at lower resolution (Table 1). This suggests that a mutant such as Leu99Met, for which the isomorphous difference is low Ê (0.081 at 2.5 A resolution), is highly isomorphous with wild type. Indeed, the Leu99Met structure has been shown to be extremely similar to wild type, with shifts in Ê the backbone not exceeding about 0.2 A (Eriksson et al., 1993). Conversely, mutants for which the isomorphous difference is large (e.g. 0.217 for Val111Met) would be expected to be rather non-isomorphous. This is also the case: the Val1113Met mutation causes some backbone shifts of up Ê to 2 A (Gassner, 1998). Of the substitutions tested in Table 1, the lowest average isomorphous difference is for Leu3Met, suggesting that this is the preferred choice for introducing additional methionines for MAD phasing. This is consistent with the fact that a methionine side chain can, at least to some degree, adopt a conformation so as to occupy the space vacated by the leucine (Gassner et al., 1996). This choice also supports the rationalization of Leahy et al. (1994), who argued that leucine should be preferred because it is the most common replacement for methionine based on comparisons of the amino-acid sequences of related proteins, i.e. on the Dayhoff mutation probability (Jones et al., 1992). As suggested by Table 2, the second-best substitution is Phe3Met rather than Ile3Met, although it should be emphasized that this is based on a small number of examples. Val3Met appears to be least favorable, re¯ecting the fact that the larger volume and different shape of a methionine side chain do not usually allow it to replace that of valine without some disruption of the structure. This ranking does not, however,

(a) Section z = 1/3 of a Patterson map calculated with coef®cients (F12-SeMet À F12-Met)2, where F12-SeMet is the observed structure amplitude for lysozyme crystals containing 12 selenomethionines and F12-Met is the observed Ê structure amplitude for the related crystals containing 12 methionines (Table 1). The resolution is 3.5 A and the map is contoured at Æ0.6', where ' is the root-mean-square density throughout the unit cell. The space group of T4 lysozyme is P3221 (Weaver & Matthews, 1987) and the positions of the expected selenium±selenium vectors, indicated by solid circles, were calculated from the re®ned structure of the 12-selenomethionine protein. For simplicity, only one set of unique vector peaks is identi®ed, the numbers corresponding to the Se atoms at sites 1, 6, 84, 91, 99, 102, 106, 118, 120, 121, 133 and 153. (b) Section z = 1/3 of the Patterson function calculated with amplitudes (F12-SeMet À F10-SeMet)2, where F12-SeMet and F10-SeMet are the observed structure amplitudes for T4 lysozymes containing 12 selenomethionines and ten selenomethionines, respectively (Table 2). The proteins are identical except that the 12-selenomethionine variant has selenomethionine at sites 133 and 153, whereas the 10selenomethionine protein has leucine and phenylalanine, respectively, at these sites. The Harker peaks that Ê correspond to the Se atoms at these two sites are labeled (cf. Fig. 1a). The resolution of the map is 3.5 A and it is contoured at Æ0.6', where ' is the root-mean-square density throughout the unit cell.

The mutants were puri®ed and crystallized using methods described previously (Eriksson et al., 1993; Gassner et al., 1996, 1997; Gassner, Baase, Lindstrom et al., 1999). Except for mutant Ile78Met, for which the data were measured with an R-AXIS IV detector, all X-ray data   were collected using a San Diego Multiwire Area Detector System (Hamlin, 1985). Rmerge = 100 jIhkl À I hkl ja I hkl , where the Ihkl are independent measurements of the intensity of a given re¯ection and I hkl is the average. Rmerge is calculated to the limit of the measured Ê data.  The isomorphous difference, Riso, is calculated to two representative resolutions, 2.5 and 3.5 A, and is de®ned as Riso =  jFMut À FWTÃ ja FWTÃ , where FMut is the structure amplitude for the mutant crystal and FWT* is that for pseudo wild-type lysozyme, which is the reference protein from which all the mutants were constructed. WT* lysozyme crystallizes in space group P3221 with unit-cell Ê parameters a = b = 60.9, c = 96.9 A. Data for mutants Leu99Met and Phe153Met are from Eriksson et al.

X-ray data for the 12-Met lysozyme were measured with a San Diego Area Detector System as described previously (Gassner et al., 1996). Data for the other variants were collected in the same way. The selenomethionine-containing variants were expressed in RR1 (Muchmore et al., 1989), a strain of bacteria not auxotrophic for methionine, using an adaptation of the procedure of Van Duyne et al.

We do not have direct experimental data to test this, but have collected together in Table 3 the data that are available, namely for the replacement of the methionines in T4 lysozyme with leucine and with alanine. The former mutants were constructed as a possible way to stabilize the protein (Hurley et al., 1992; Lipscomb et al., 1998), while the latter were generated primarily to investigate the hydrophobic stabilization of proteins (Blaber et al., 1995; Baldwin et al., 1998; Xu et al., 1998). It will be noticed that, as a group, the replacements of methionine with leucine have larger isomorphous differences than do the replacements with alanine. This is because, in the case of Met63Leu for example, there are large structural perturbations [and, in addition, the protein is substantially destabilized (by 2.8 kcal molÀ1 or 11.7 kJ molÀ1)]. The replacement of methionine with alanine occurs with relatively low frequency in the Dayhoff mutation probability matrix presumably because such substitutions, if at internal sites, are likely to reduce protein stability owing to decreased hydrophobic stabilization and possible cavity formation. In terms of maintaining isomorphism, however, Table 3 suggests that there may be an advantage in simply truncating a methionine to alanine, rather than replacing it with an amino acid of different shape and incurring the risk of structural non-isomorphism induced by steric clash.

agree with that based on the frequency of amino-acid substitutions in related proteins. Rather than the overall ranking of Leu, Phe, Ile and Val seen here, sequence comparison suggests Leu, Ile, Val, Thr and Phe (Jones et al., 1992; Leahy et al., 1994)
Acta Cryst. (1999). D55, 1967±1970

If it is desired to remove methionines from a protein without disruption of the structure, amino-acid sequence comparison suggests that the optimal replacements, in order of choice, are Ile, Leu, Val, Thr and Phe (Jones et al., 1992; Leahy et al., 1994).
