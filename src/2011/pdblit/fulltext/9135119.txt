DNA structural engineering using immobile junctions
Nadrian C. Seeman
New York University, New York, USA Immobile DNA branched junctions are a complex macromolecular system whose structural features are readily tractable to a simple sequence-design algorithm based on the minimization of sequence symmetry. This algorithm has been applied to the construction of Holliday recombination analogs and to multiply-connected geometrical objects, including a DNA molecule with the connectivity of a cube. Current Opinion in Structural Biology 1991, 1:653-661

Introduction
The initial motivation for designing stable branched DNA molecules derives from the role of branched DNA in recombination, a process that promotes genetic diversity within all living species from viruses to humans. The basic feature of recombination is the interaction of two pieces of DNA to yield new genetic material which may exhibit insertions, deletions, changes of sequence, rearrangements, or exchanges of flanking markers. A central intermediate in recombination is the four-arm Holliday junction [1]; this type of structure is known to arise from site-specific recombination [2-5] and is also thought to be involved in homologous recombination

[6].
As shown in Fig. 1, the Holliday junction structure may be formed by the exchange of homologous strands, so that its branch point is free to move over the entire region of homology. This isomerization reaction, known as branch migration [7,8], makes it difficult to study naturally occurring Holliday junctions and the recombination enzymes that interact with them, because a population of junctions may have branch points at different posiIons. Immobile junctions [9-11] fix the branch point precisely, whereas partially mobile junctions [2,9,12-15] limit migration to a specific number of steps. It is important to emphasize that immobile junctions are lowsymmetry analogs of the Holliday structure; this low symmetry may introduce features that differ from those of true Holiday junctions. It is also important to recognize that a related system, cruciforms extruded from superhelical circles [16,17], may be an inappropriate model for Holiday junctions because of possible residual torsional stress in the supercoiled arms. The extensive characterization of the physical properties [11,15,18-26,27"-31"] and enzymatic resolution [32,33,34",35",36-39] of these systems is largely beyond the scope of this article. In addition to their role as Holliday junction analogs, immobile junctions can also be used to construct geo-

metrical objects from DNA [9]. The versatility of DNA molecules as a self-assembling system for structural applications has been largely unappreciated. The inherent ditficulty in imagining DNA molecules as an appropriate starting material for nanoscale construction is that in living systems they are organized about linear helix axes. The double helix may be writhing, supercoiled or even knotted over a long distance, but the helix axis remains unbranched. From a structural point of view, this means that double-helical nucleic acids correspond to line segments, which can only form longer lines or linear cycles; however, immobile DNA junctions add nucleic acid vertices to the DNA structural repertoire. With this addition, one can imagine constructing stick figures whose edges are double helical DN& and whose vertices are the branch points of junctions. It has been suggested that individual and periodic objects made from branched DNA molecules might be used as molecular scaffolding with which to orientate and juxtapose other molecules [9]. DNA is particularly well suited for use as a scaffolding medium as it is thick (2 nm diameter), stiff over a range of a few nanometers [40], and its structure is unlikely to be perturbed markedly by the attachment of smaller non-interactive molecules. The motivations for pursuing these constructions include the formation of macromolecular 'zeolite' lattices to allow diffraction analysis of complex guest molecules that are not readily crystallized [9], the caging of active biological macromolecules to form new multi-functional enzymes, as well as drug delivery systems for therapeutic macromolecules [41], mechanical control on the nanometer scale [42], and the assembly of molecular electronic components [43,44]. In keeping with the emphasis of this section of the issue on engineering and design, this article will stress sequence assignment algorithms, some constructions of DNA geometrical objects, and recent studies of the components of the branched-DNA assembly system.

Fig. 1. The Holliday junction in recombination. Stages of recombination are identified by letters in parentheses, the processes that
produce them are identified by Roman numbers. (a) Two homologous double helices of DNA align with each other. The two strands of each duplex are indicated by the two pairs of lines terminated by half arrows, which indicate the 3' ends of the strands. Each of these two homologous regions carries a flanking marker, A and B for the strands on the left, and o[ and ~ for the strands on the right. (b) The homologous pairs have formed a Holliday intermediate by exchanging strands. The two crossover strands are composite strands formed through any of a number of possibilities for process I. The twofold sequence symmetry of this structure permits it to undergo the iterative isomerization process, II, known as branch migration; movement in the direction indicated would result in (c). The crossover point defines four arms, one above and one below the crossover, on each of the two double helical domains. The Holliday intermediate may or may not undergo isomerization process III to produce (d), in which the strands are switched. This process only has meaning if the Holliday intermediate has twofold rather than fourfold symmetry. If process II1 occurs an odd number of times, cleavage (process IV) of the crossover strands yields (e), although (e') results if III occurs an even number of times before cleavage. Ligation (process V) of (e') generates a pair of linear duplex DNA molecules that contain heteroduplex DNA because of branch migration, but which have retained the same flanking markers. Ligation of (e) yields molecules that have exchanged flanking markers. A parallel motif has been used for the structure of the junctions, although recent data suggest an antiparallel structure for the immobile Holliday junction analog. This is clone to prevent confusion between the genetic consequences and the physical structures associated with these intermediates.

Design of nucleic acid structures by sequence-symmetry minimization
In the early 1980s, the desire to model branched DNA molecules led to the development of the sequencesymmetry-minimization algorithm [9] to promote their formation in oligonucleotide systems. This algorithm selects sequences with the goal of minimizing sequence similarities between segments of molecules; thus, the chances of undesired associations are decreased and control over secondary structure is improved. Although not physically comprehensive, this procedure is probably the strictest means of sequence selection in use; minimization of symmetry maximizes control over the system. Sequence-symmetry minimization has

been employed successfully in a number of applications [11,27°,45,46,47..], but it is worth noting that the sequences of some branched DNA molecules do not minimize sequence symmetry without untoward effects [35°]. It is very difficult to predict the secondary structure of a nucleic acid molecule of arbitrary sequence [48,49], but it has not been difficult to design sequences for molecules so that they will assume a targeted secondary structure [11,27o,45,46,47.o]. The basic premise underlying the sequence-symmetry-minimization procedure is that DNA will form continuous, perfectly paired, Watson--Crick double-helical segments in preference to other arrangements; given enough perfect pairs, one can force one or more oligonucleotide strands to assume sec-

In addition to being unique, none of the 52 tetramer elements in J1 is complementary to a tetramer that spans the junction. The use of sequences complementary to a region designed not to be perfectly complemented (e.g. branch points or single-stranded loops) increases sequence symmetry. The key to engineering molecules so that they form a particular structure is to enhance the difficulty of adopting alternative structures [9,51"]. In addition to repetitive features of the sequence, branch migration at junctions can be eliminated [9] or limited [2,9,12-15] by prohibiting twofold symmetry across the branch point beyond a desired range.

Fig. 2. A stable DNA branched junction. The junction shown, called Jl, is composed of four strands of DNA, labeled I-IV. The 3' end of each strand is indicated by the half-arrows. Each strand is paired with two other strands to form four double helical arms (I-IV). The hydrogen-bonded base pairing that forms the double helices is indicated by the dots between the bases. The sequence of this junction has been optimized to minimize symmetry and non-Watson-Crick base pairing. Because there is no homologous twofold sequence symmetry flanking the central branch point, this junction cannot undergo the branch-migration isomerization reaction.

ondary structures that otherwise would not form spontaneously. It is one of the ironies of the branched-junction system that smaller junctions are harder to design than large ones, because their arms contain fewer base pairs favoring formation of the branch point. Sequence assignment would be easiest if one had a 'vocabulary'. of many different sets of complementary bases, such as those recently synthesized by Benner and colleagues [50°-]; however, only the hydrogen-bonding schemes defined b); the base pairs A.T and G.C are readily available. One can increase the size of the vocabulary by treating longer contiguous segments as unique components, generating 256 tetramers, 1024 pentamers and 4096 hexamers. For example, the well characterized branched junction complex, J1 [11,18-22,31 °] shown in Fig. 2 contains four hexadecamer strands designed in this way; each hexadecamer strand consists of 13 overlapping tetramers, and each of the 52 tetramer elements in the entire complex is unique. Thus, competition with the designated structure comes from Watson-Crick pairing segments containing three or fewer base pairs.

Fig. 3. A tethered junction in which stacking domains are determined by the length of the tether. The junction shown is tethered to assume a parallel structure. The arms above the crossover point are 15 nucleotide pairs long, whereas those below the crossover point are 10 nucleotide pairs long. When the tether consists of dT6, one stacking structure is seen, but a different stacking structure is seen if the tether is loosened by making it dTg.

The design of nucleic acid secondary structure must often include more than the combinatorial considerations discussed above; it may be necessary to model possible molecular geometries. For example, when designing loops that link different helices together, it is necessary to allow enough space to avoid undue strain on the molecule. In a recent study by Kimball et al. [52"], a short tether between two helices within a single junction (Fig. 3) altered the preferred stacking dominance pattern [18]; lengthening the tether from dT 6 to dT 9 restored the stacking dominance pattern seen in untethered junctions.

Fig. 4. Formation of a two-dimensional lattice from an immobile junction with 'sticky' ends. A is a sticky end and A' is its complement. The same relationship exists between 13and B'. Four of the monomeric junctions on the left are complexed in parallel orientation to yield the structure on the right. A and B differ from each other, as indicated by the pairing in the complex. DNA ligase can close the gaps left in the complex, which has maintained open valences, so that it can be extended by the addition of more monomers.

Construction of DNA objects
Genetic engineering with unbranched DNA molecules uses cohesive 'sticky' ends on different fragments to direct their assembly in a particular order [53]: these single-stranded regions pair with complementary singlestranded regions on the molecules to form complexes that are then annealed to covalency by DNA ligase. Nucleic acid branched junctions can be treated in the same way. Attachment of particular sticky ends to a branched nucleic acid structure converts it, in principle, to a highly specific valence cluster with addressable ends [3,54,55] that will cohere specifically with complementary molecules. These branched molecules are building blocks that can, in principle, be assembled into stick figures and multiply connected networks. A key concept here is 'connectedness', which is the number of edges of a closed object or a lattice that meet at a vertex; the number of arms of the junction at a given vertex limits the maximum connectedness of that vertex. Thus, threeconnected objects and lattices can be built with threearm junctions, and four-connected structures can be built with four-arm junctions. The largest number of arms designed into a junction so far is six [56"]. Figure 4 illustrates four four-arm junctions serf-assembling to form a four-connected square complex that has the potential for lattice formation.

Experiments in which three-arm and four-arm junctions have been oligomerized into macrocycles suggest that they are flexible; trimers, tetramers, pentamers and higher macrocycles can be formed by oligomerization of the same molecule [46,57]. The assembly of four three-arm junctions into a pre-designed specific quadrilateral [41] is illustrated in Fig. 5. The quadrilateral shown has its vertices separated by approximately 1.5 helical turns of DNA, and thus consists of two hextuply linked cyclic single strands. The assembly was analysed by using the restriction sites on the exocyclic arms for selectively digesting and sequencing the molecule. The sequence-symmetryminimization procedure has recently been revised to permit the sequence assignment of large multiply-connected objects [51"]. The formations of macrocycles and the quadrilateral are effectively two-connected syntheses. Very recently, this system has been extended by the construction of a threeconnected object, a molecule whose helix axes have the connectivity of a cube or a rhombohedron [47"']. This object is illustrated in Fig. 6. The molecule is a hexacatenane of six cyclic single-stranded circles; each circle corresponds to a face of the molecule. Each edge is designed to be two turns of DNA long; thus, every face is doubly linked to each of its four nearest neighbors. Each of its 12 edges contains a separate restriction site for analytical purposes. The sequence of the molecule has been

5. The scheme of synthesis of a DNA quadrilateral. The individual reactant junctions are shown on the left of the figure and the product is shown on the right. For clarity, the double helix of the DNA has been represented merely as parallel lines in the vicinity of the branch sites, and twisting is confined to regions distal to the branch sites; nevertheless, all the twisting expected on the main cycle is shown on both sides of the figure. On the left, filled strands and unfilled strands are associated in pairs to form three-arm junctions, in which one 'excocyclic' arm is closed in a hairpin loop. Arrowheads represent the 3' ends of individual strands (numbered 1-8). The 5' and 3' symbols indicate the sense of the single-stranded overhangs. The overhangs are all on the short strands. The filled region in the exocyclic stem formed by strand 6 represents a restriction site, while the filled region in the stem of strand 4 corresponds to a different restriction site. When the ligation is complete, the four junctions are expected to form two intersecting DNA circles that are linked six times.

designed by application of the sequence-symmetry-minimization algorithm. The product has been formed by joining two hybridized quadrilaterals into a belt-like ladder structure which, after purification, is cyclized to form the target molecule [47.-]; the direction of cyclization is not currently known. The belt-like ladder intermediate can be formed with 20 nucleotide pairs per edge, but cannot be formed with 21 nucleotide pairs per edge; this suggests that the effective twist through a three-connected three-arm junction is smaller than that through a two-connected two-arm junction.

porphyrins [61"]. If these studies bear on junctions when they are incorporated into geometrical objects, these objects may be well suited for the non-covalent transport of molecules that interact with DNA. Previous studies of four-arm immobile Holliday junction analogs have established that the analog has a roughly twofold symmetrical [15,18,22-25], antiparallel [22-25] structure in which the four arms form two dominant stacking domains; the bases nearest the branch point determine which domain pair (e.g. I-II and III-W, or I1-III and W-I, see Fig. 2) is dominant [15,23]. A recently constructed five-arm junction shows no stacking dominance, but a single dominant stacking domain is seen in a sixarm junction [56"]. Five-arm and six-arm junctions are less stable than three-arm and four-arm junctions, and require longer arms to stabilize their structures [56"]. For reasons of economy, the three-arm junction has been used extensively in DNA constructions such as the cube-like molecule; hence its equilibrium structure is of interest. Duckett and Lilley [62.] have performed Cooper-Hagerman electrophoresis experiments [22] in which the electrophoretic mobility of pairwise-extended arms is monitored; those experiments on three-arm junctions demonstrate no difference in mobility between the

Structural studies that bear on engineered DNA objects
The possible use of branched DNA objects in drugdelivery systems makes it inlportant to determine the binding properties of the branch point. Kallenbach and colleagues [58,59"~51"] have probed four-arm junctions with a number of ligands, and found that the branch point is an excellent site for binding intercalative drugs, including propidium [58,59"], Stains-All dye [60.] and

have the connectivity of a cube. The molecule shown consists of six cyclic strands that have been catenated together in this particular arrangement. They are labeled by the first letters of their positional designations: up (U), down (D), front (F), back (B), left (L) and right (R). Each edge consists of two turns of double-helical DNA, and hence each strand is doubly linked to each of its four nearest neighbors. The vertices correspond to the branch points of three-arm DNA junctions. The structure is drawn with the major-groove portions of the helices on the outside at the vertices, but whether they are inside or outside has not been determined. As each edge contains 20 base pairs of DNA, it will be about 68 A long. From model building, the axis-to-axis distance across a square face appears to be about 100A, with a volume (in a cubic configuration) of approximately 1760nm 3, when the cube is folded as shown, so that major grooves form the outsides of the corners; it is markedly smaller when the corners are formed from minor grooves.

References and recommended reading Concluding remarks
The sequence-symmetry-minimization algorithm has been used successfully for sequence assignment in the engineering of nucleic acid secondary structure; it has been used in the design of several DNA branched junctions and also in the design of a molecule whose helix axes have the connectivity of a cube. The assembly of multiply connected objects from branched DNA molecules is a nascent structural endeavor. The formation o f a cube-like molecule from polyanionic backbones is a difficult synthesis because of the repulsion likely to result from the small average inter-edge angles. Although they are more complex, better approximations to the sphere [64] may be easier to form. This system will achieve much of its potential when it is possible to synthesize three-dimensional periodic arrays out of branched DNA components. Nevertheless, this is a difficult goal to achieve, because of the inherent inability to exploit symmetry minimization in building a lattice [42,54].

They demonstrate that the commonly used Forster equation alone does not provide a quantitative description of fluorescence energy transfer in nucleic acid systems. Although their measurements are in qualitative agreement with earlier measurements of the angles between arms derived by other means, they caution against quantitative interpretation of fluorescence energy transfer in these systems.

In order to explore the con~quences of junctions with fixed conformational isomers, tethered junctions based on J1 have been constructed. These correspond to the four canonical isomers of the Holliday junction, parallel and antiparallel stacking domains constructed from both sets of stacking domains. It is possible to make these junctions, and they give characteristic Fe(ll).EDTA2 auto-footprints. The stacking dominance in the parallel case is a function of tether length.

WANGY, MULLERJE, KEMPERB, SEEMANNC: The Assembly and Characterization of 5.Arm and 6-Arm DNA Branched Junctions. Biochemistry 1991, 30:5667-5674. The connectivity of objects constructed from DNA is limited by the number of arms in the junction. The five-arm and six-arm junctions constructed here extend the range of connectedness. Both require longer arms to be stable than do three-arm and four-arm junctions. The fivearm junction has no dominant stacking domains, but the six-arm junction contains a single one. In principle, five-connected and six-connected lattices and objects, such as icosahedral deltahedra can now be constructed using these components. 57.

47. CHEN SEEMANNC: The Synthesis from DNA of a Molecule J, ·o with the Connectivity of a Cube. Nature 1991, 350:631~533. Ten DNA strands are annealed to form two squares that are covalendy linked via two adjacent arms on each complex. The triply catenated single-stranded belt so formed is purified from failure products, reconstituted to a double helix and then cyclized to form a molecule with the connectivity of a tetragonal prism. Proof of synthesis is by cleavage of the original triple catenane, corresponding to the left-front-right sides of the cube, yielding a second triple catenane that corresponds to the up-back-down sides of the object. The final object is a hexacatenane of single strands, each corresponding to a face, and each doubly linked to each of its four nearest neighbors. Each edge of the three-connected molecule is double-helical DNA. 48. JAEGER JA, TURNER DH, ZUKER M: Lmproved Prediction of Secondary Structures for RNA. proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1989, 86:7706-7710.

Footpdnting with Cu(I)-(O-phenanthroline)2 permits localization of the binding site of propidium to the branch point of the J1 molecule. Excess propidium appears to reverse the stacking dominance pattern of the junction. 60. , Lu M, G u t Q, SEEMAN NC, KALLENBACHNR: Drug Binding by Branched DNA: Selective Interaction of the Dye Stains-All with an Immobile Junction.

Footprmting experiments using methidiumpropyt-EDTA-Fe(II) and Cu(1)-(O-phenanthroline)2 are used to show that the dye binds to the branch point of the junction. The dye binds over a hundred times more tightly than methidium or ethidium. 61.
