Chronic colonization of the lungs by opportunist bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the Bcc (Burkholderia cepacia complex) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality among CF (cystic fibrosis) patients. PA-IIL (lecB gene), a soluble lectin from Ps. aeruginosa, has been the subject of much interest because of its very strong affinity for fucose. Orthologues have been identified in the opportunist bacteria Ralstonia solanacearum, Chromobacterium violaceum and Burkholderia of Bcc. The genome of the J2315 strain of B. cenocepacia, responsible for epidemia in CF centres, contains three genes that code for proteins with PA-IIL domains. The shortest gene was cloned in Escherichia coli and pure recombinant protein, BclA (B. cenocepacia lectin A), was obtained. The presence of native BclA in B. cenocepacia extracts was checked using a proteomic approach. The specificity of recombinant BclA was characterized using surface plasmon resonance showing a preference for mannosides and supported with glycan array experiments demonstrating a strict

specificity for oligomannose-type N-glycan structures. The interaction thermodynamics of BclA with methyl -D-mannoside demonstrates a dissociation constant (K d ) of 2.75 × 10-6 M. The X-ray crystal structure of the complex with methyl -Dmannoside was determined at 1.7 Å (1 Å = 0.1 nm) resolution. The lectin forms homodimers with one binding site per monomer, acting co-operatively with the second dimer site. Each monomer contains two Ca2+ ions and one sugar ligand. Despite strong sequence similarity, the differences between BclA and PAIIL in their specificity, binding site and oligomerization mode indicate that the proteins should have different roles in the bacteria. Key words: bacterial lectin, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia cepacia complex, mannose-binding lectin, Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

INTRODUCTION

The Bcc (Burkholderia cepacia complex) is a collection of genetically distinct but phenotypically similar bacteria that are divided into at least nine species [1]. They colonize plant­rhizosphere systems, and aquatic and human environments, and their abilities to degrade organic compounds and to produce antimicrobial compounds give them environmental and biotechnological potential [2]. However, the Bcc bacteria are also opportunistic pathogens. Among them, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Burkholderia multivorans cause variable lung infections in CF (cystic fibrosis) patients, the most dangerous being `cepacia syndrome', which is characterized by a rapid decline in lung function [3­5]. Some strains with resistance to antibiotics are also responsible for nosocomial infections. Bacteria of the Bcc share many characteristics with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both are opportunistic bacteria that are found in various environments, including soil, water and vegetation. They can both form biofilms, and the occurrence of mixed biofilms has been demonstrated with the use of common signal molecules in the quorum-sensing system [6]. Moreover, a frequent exchange

of genetic material has been confirmed between the two organisms [7]. Among the virulence factors deployed by Ps. aeruginosa in the infection progress, soluble lectins PA-IL (Ps. aeruginosa lectin 1), coded by the lecA gene, and PA-IIL (Ps. aeruginosa lectin 2), coded by the lecB gene, have high affinity for galactose and fucose respectively [8,9]. Their ability to bind to the carbohydrate moiety of mucus or glycoconjugates at epithelial cell surfaces make them good candidates for host recognition and cell-surface adhesion. PA-IIL has also been proposed to play a role in biofilm formation [10]. Although orthologues of the lecA gene have not been identified in other pathogenic bacteria at the present time, lecB-like sequences are present in the genomes of Ralstonia solanacearum and Chromobacterium violaceum [11,12], two opportunistic pathogens that can cause rapid infections and septicaemia in immunocompromised humans. Sequence and structural comparisons have shown that the three lectins PA-IIL, RS-IIL (R. solanacearum lectin 2) and CV-IIL (C. violaceum lectin 2) share the same tetrameric arrangement with the unique characteristic of the presence of two Ca2+ ions in the monosaccharide-binding site [13­15]. These lectins have unusually

high affinity for their monosaccharide ligands (in the micromolar range) and they can bind both L-fucose and D-mannose, with their preference depending on a particular stretch of three amino acids in the binding site [9]. Since bacteria of the Bcc are closely related in behaviour and taxonomy to Ps. aeruginosa, it is perhaps not surprising to locate lecB-like genes in the recently sequenced genome of some strains, particularly of B. cenocepacia. Indeed, several genes coding for lectins or lectin domains with similarity to PA-IIL have been identified in each strain. In most cases, an uncharacterized N-terminal domain is attached to the lectin. However, we have demonstrated in the present study that the resulting Burkholderia lectins are rather different to PA-IIL and the other members of this family. In the present paper, we describe the cloning, production, specificity and structure of BclA (B. cenocepacia lectin A), the product of the smallest lecB-like gene from B. cenocepacia J2315 which is the ET12 lineage epidemic strain that has caused significant mortality among CF patients in the U.K. [16].
EXPERIMENTAL Partial purification of native BclA and MS characterization

performed against the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) protein database and against a local database containing corresponding protein sequences.
Gene cloning

The oligonucleotide primers were as follows: 5 -GGAGAAACATATGGCTGATTCTCAAACGTC-3 (30-mer) and 5 -GTAAGCTTAGCCGATCGGCCACTG-3 (24-mer). The former was designed for the introduction of NdeI and the latter for HindIII restriction sites (underlined sequences). PCR was performed using Pfu polymerase (Promega) and genomic DNA from B. cenocepacia strain J2315 as a template. After digestion with NdeI and HindIII, the amplified fragment was introduced into the multiple cloning site of pRSET vector (Invitrogen), resulting in plasmid pRSETbcla.
Lectin expression, purification and characterization

B. cenocepacia strain J2315 (CCM 4899, LMG 16656) obtained from the Czech Collection of Microorganisms at Brno, Czech Republic, was grown with shaking at 37 C in LB (Luria­Bertani) medium overnight. Batches of LB medium (250 ml in 1 litre Erlenmeyer flasks) were inoculated with 2.5 ml of the overnight culture, and D-mannose was added to a final concentration of 50 mM. Cells were incubated at 30 C with shaking for 4 days. Afterwards, cells were removed by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min (4 C), resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and disintegrated by sonication. The cytosolic extract was separated by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min (4 C), filtered through a 0.22-m-pore-size sterile filter and applied to a D-mannose­agarose HR5/10 column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl and 100 M CaCl2 . Bound proteins were eluted by 0.1 % SDS, dialysed overnight against distilled water and freeze-dried. Freeze-dried proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE (14 % gel) and stained with Coomassie Blue R250. A band corresponding to the expected molecular mass of the BclA lectin was excised from the gel and analysed by MS. After destaining, the protein was incubated with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) at 37 C for 16 h. Digested peptides were extracted from gels using 50 % acetonitrile solution with 5 % methanoic (formic) acid. Protein digests were analysed by MALDI (matrix-assisted laserdesorption ionization)-MS and subsequently using LC (liquid chromatography)­MS/MS (tandem MS). MALDI-MS analyses were performed on a Bruker Reflex IV (Bruker Daltonik) operated in reflector mode with detection of positively charged ions using -cyanohydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. LC­MS/MS experiments used an HPLC system consisting of a gradient pump (Ultimate), autosampler (Famos) and column switching device (Switchos; LC Packings) coupled with an Esquire 2000 ion-trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik). Tryptic digests were concentrated and desalted using a PepMap C18 trapping column (300 m × 5 mm; LC Packings) with a typical sample volume of 10 l. After washing with 0.1 % methanoic acid, the peptides were eluted from the trapping column using an acetonitrile/water gradient (4 l/min) on to a fused silica capillary column (320 m × 180 mm, 4 m pore size; Jupiter Proteo, Phenomenex), for peptide separation. The MASCOT 2.0 (MatrixScience) search engine was used for processing the MS and MS/MS data. Sequence searches were

Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing the plasmid pRSETbcla were cultured in LB broth medium at 37 C. When the culture reached a D600 of 0.5­0.6, IPTG (isopropyl -Dthiogalactoside) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Cells were harvested after 3 h incubation at 30 C, washed and resuspended in equilibrating buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, 100 mM NaCl and 100 M CaCl2 , pH 7.5). The cells were broken by cell disruption (Constant Cell Disruption System). After centrifugation at 50 000 g for 30 min at 4 C and filtration, the supernatant was purified further on a D-mannose­agarose column (Sigma­Aldrich). BclA was allowed to bind to the immobilized mannose in equilibrating buffer. After washing with buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl, 1 M NaCl and 100 M CaCl2 , pH 7.5), it was eluted using 20 mM Tris/HCl, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5). The purified protein was extensively dialysed against 5 mM CaCl2 for 2 days and against distilled water for a further 4 days, freeze-dried and stored at - 20 C. A Superose 12 column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 20 mM Tris/HCl and 0.3 mM NaCl (pH 7.5) and run at 0.75 ml/ min, was used to estimate the molecular mass and oligomeric state of the purified BclA protein. A calibration curve for molecular size estimation was generated by individually loading cytochrome c, myoglobin, ovalbumin and BSA. Further characterization of the BclA lectin was made using DLS (dynamic light scattering) and DSC (differential scanning calorimetry). DSC experiments were performed on a VP-DSC differential scanning micro-calorimeter (Microcal) at a BclA concentration of 1.1 mM and scan rate of 1.0 K/min in 20 mM Tris/ HCl, 100 mM NaCl and 100 M CaCl2 (pH 7.5). A background scan collected with buffer in both cells was subtracted from each scan. The DSC data were fitted to a non-two-state unfolding model, which allows estimation of the calorimetric heat change ( H) and the van't Hoff heat change ( Hv) of the thermal unfolding transition. DLS measurements were carried out with a Zetasizer Nano-ZS machine (Malvern Instruments) using DTS software for data acquisition and analysis. Five different concentrations of BclA ranging from 0.4 to 2 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris/HCl, 100 mM NaCl and 100 M CaCl2 (pH 7.5) were prepared, and size distribution of the particles by intensity and volume were measured.
SPR (surface plasmon resonance)

All SPR experiments were performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument at 25 C using HBS (Hepes-buffered saline: 10 mM Hepes and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.005 % (v/v) Tween 20 and a flow rate of 5 l/min. Two experimental arrangements were used to evaluate the sugar preference of the lectin.

In the first experimental set-up, measurements were carried out simultaneously on three measuring channels using different immobilized sugars: D-galactose, D-mannose and L-fucose. Biot­ PAA (biotinylated polyacrylamide) probes bearing sugar moieties (Lectinity Corp) were trapped on a CM5 sensor chip that was coated with streptavidin using the standard procedure. Each Biot­ PAA­monosaccharide (50 l at concentration 200 g/ml) was injected to the selected channel. Direct binding curves of the lectin to immobilized sugars were measured over the concentration range 0.06­1 mg/ml. For the inhibition studies, BclA was diluted in running buffer to 200 g/ml and mixed with 10 × concentrated carbohydrate competitor in a 9:1 ratio. This mixture (20 l) was injected on to the CM5 chip at a flow rate of 5 l/min. The CM5 chip was regenerated using 100 mM EDTA. Binding was measured as RU (resonance units) over time, and data were evaluated using the BIAevaluation Software, version 4.1. As BclA does not bind to D-galactose, the corresponding channel was used as a blank. Data were fitted using a kinetic model for 1:1 binding. For IC50 evaluation, Req (RU corresponding to steadystate equilibrium), calculated from fitted curves, were taken as the amount of BclA bound to the sugar surface in the presence of competing monosaccharide. In the second experimental set-up, direct measurements were performed with BclA immobilized on the carboxymethyldextran surface of the CM5 chip. Similarly to the streptavidin immobilization, the chip was activated with EDC (N-ethylN -[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodi-imide)/NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) solution and BclA in 10 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.5) was injected into the flow channel. Finally, the sensor surface was blocked with 1 M ethanolamine. The blank channel was treated similarly, except for the lectin injection. Carbohydrate solutions (20 l with concentrations between 0.97 and 500 M) in running buffer were injected into the flow cells using the kinject mode. As the association and dissociation kinetics of monosaccharides was fast, further regeneration of the chip surface was not necessary. The equilibrium response (after subtraction from the response of the reference surface) of each experiment was used to create curves of analyte binding, which were both evaluated using Scatchard plots and fitted to a 1:1 steady-state affinity model using Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab Corp.).
Glycan microarray analysis

using a single-site binding model (Origin 7.0). Fitted data yielded the association constant (K a ) and the enthalpy of binding ( H). Other thermodynamic parameters, i.e. changes in free energy, G, and entropy, S, were calculated from the equation: G= H-T S = -RT ln K a where T is the absolute temperature and R = 8.314 J · mol-1 · K-1 . Two to three independent titrations were performed for each ligand tested.
Crystallization and data collection

Freeze-dried protein was dissolved in water (15 mg/ml) in the presence of methyl -D-mannoside (400 g/ml). Initial crystallization conditions were screened using the complete Hampton Screens I and II (Hampton Research). Crystals in the form of thin plates appeared after several days in the presence of ammonium sulfate and PEG [poly(ethylene glycol)] 3350, 5000MME (monomethyl ether) or 8000. Crystals were cryocooled at 100 K after soaking them for as short a time as possible in 15 % (v/v) glycerol mixed with precipitant solution. One such crystal was used to obtain a first set of diffraction data collected to 1.95 Å (1 Å = 0.1 nm) resolution. It belongs to space group C2 with cell dimensions a = 153.7 Å, b = 49.6 Å and c = 114.3 Å, and  = 125.9. Optimization of the initial crystallization conditions yielded crystals resembling small triangles from 2.5 l of BclA (14 mg/ml) solution in complex with methyl -D-mannoside (700 g/ml) mixed with 2.5 l of reservoir solution consisting of 30 % PEG 8000 and 0.2 M ammonium sulfate. This crystal form belongs to space group C2221 with cell dimensions a = 50.0 Å, b = 185.7 Å and c = 187.5 Å. After seeding, one thicker crystal was obtained and was cryo-cooled at 100 K after soaking for as short a time as possible in 20 % (v/v) glycerol mixed with precipitant solution. Diffraction data to 1.7 Å resolution were obtained. Both data sets were collected at ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility), Grenoble, France, on stations ID14­2 and ID14­3 using an ADSC Q4R CCD (charge-coupled device) detector (Quantum Corp.) Diffraction images were integrated using MOSFLM [18] and scaled and converted into structure factors using the CCP4 program suite [19]. Statistics for the two data collections are shown in Table 1.
Structure solution and refinement

BclA was labelled with Alexa Fluor® 488­TFP (tetrafluorophenyl) (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and purified on a D-Salt polyacrylamide desalting column (Pierce). Alexa Fluor® 488-labelled BclA was used to probe the printed glycan arrays [17] following the standard procedure of Core H of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (http://www. functionalglycomics.org/).
Microcalorimetry

Titration calorimetry experiments were performed using a Microcal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. All titrations were carried out in 0.1 M Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 3 M CaCl2 at 25 C. Aliquots of 10 l of each carbohydrate at various concentrations from 1.5 to 3 mM, dissolved in the same buffer, were added at 5 min intervals to the lectin solution present in the calorimeter cell. In the titrations, the protein concentration in the cell varied from 0.15 to 0.4 mM. The temperature of the cell was controlled to + 25 - 0.1 C. Control experiments performed by injection of buffer into the protein solution yielded insignificant heats of dilution. Integrated heat effects were analysed by non-linear regression

A monomer of PA-IIL (PDB code 1GZT, with removal of ligands and water molecules) was used as a probe for molecular replacement for the monoclinic crystal form of BclA using the program MOLREP [20]. Five monomers were located, and, after an initial refinement cycle, the electron-density maps of this complex showed glycerol instead of methyl -D-mannoside in the binding site. This structure was not refined further, but was used as the search probe for the orthorhombic crystal, again giving five monomers in the asymmetric unit. After refinement, the electrondensity maps of this complex showed clear features corresponding to one methyl -D-mannoside molecule and two Ca2+ ions per monomer. Crystallographic refinement was carried out with the program REFMAC [21] and manual model building was achieved using Coot [22]. Alternative conformations were constructed where necessary (with occupancies estimated from the refined relative B-factors of the conformations). The final model consists of all 630 residues with five sugar molecules, ten Ca2+ ions, four sulfate ions, zero glycerol molecules and 1164 water molecules with an Rcrys of 16.9 % and Rfree of 20.3 % to 1.7 Å resolution.

The B. cenocepacia J2315 genome sequence consists of three chromosomal replicons and a small plasmid. Three lecB-related genes, with sizes of 384, 732 and 816 bp, are present in the second chromosome, and the corresponding gene products are referred to as BclA (129 amino acids without the initiating methionine residue), BclB (244 amino acids) and BclC (272 amino acids) (Figure 1, top panel). A fourth gene with sequence similarities to lecB was identified on the third chromosome. This last gene is invalidated due to a frameshift, but in the genome of other Burkholderia species such as B. cepacia R18194-ATCC17660 (DOE) or Burkholderia sp. SAR-1, it could code for a protein of 289 or 296 amino acids respectively. In the present study, we focused on the analysis of BclA, the shortest protein encoded by a lecB-like gene in B. cenocepacia. This gene was identified in five strains of B. cenocepacia and one strain of B. ambifaria, as well as an environmental sample from the Sargasso sea that is likely to contain B. (ceno)cepacia. An alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences is shown in Figure 1(B). All Burkholderia BclA protein sequences are very similar, having 32 % identity with PA-IIL. The amino acids involved in the binding of the two Ca2+ ions are conserved, as well as the C-terminal glycine residue that is involved in the architecture of the binding site through dimer formation. However, the BclA sequences are longer than the PA-IIL one, with seven additional amino acids at the N-terminus and a nine amino acid insertion in the region corresponding to Asn85 of PA-IIL (all sequence numbering is given without initial methionine residues). The amino acids involved in sugar binding are partly conserved with a specificity loop consisting of Ala29 -Ala30 -Glu31 in BclA compared with Ser22 -Ser23 -Gly24 in PA-IIL. The higher affinity for mannose over fucose has been previously mainly attributed to the presence of an alanine residue instead of a serine residue at the first position of the specificity loop triplet in RS-IIL from R. solanacearum [15], and BclA would therefore be predicted to display some preference for mannose.
Identification of BclA in B. cenocepacia

Co-ordinates have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank under code 2VNV. Molecular drawings were prepared using Molscript [23].
RESULTS Occurrence of lecB-like gene in Burkholderia genomes

The Burkholderia genus comprises more than 40 Burkholderia species [24], 12 of which have had their genome sequenced or are in the process of being sequenced. Among them, the Bcc is represented by several strains of B. cenocepacia and others. A similarity search based on the lecB sequence allowed the identification of genes coding for related proteins in several of these genomes, all of them corresponding to species both belonging to the Bcc and reported in CF isolates (see Supplementary Table S1 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/411/bj4110307add.htm), namely B. cenocepacia, B. cepacia, Burkholderia ambifaria and Burkholderia dolosa. However, no lecB-like sequence could be found in the completed genomes of Burkholderia thailandensis, a soil inhabitant, or of Burkholderia mallei or Burkholderia pseudomallei, which are primary pathogens that cause glanders in animals and melioidosis in humans respectively. Surprisingly, in all genomes from Bcc species where it was identified, the lecB-like gene does not appear as a single copy, as previously observed in Ps. aeruginosa, R. solanacearum and C. violaceum, but at the 3 -terminus of several genes coding for proteins of various sizes (Supplementary Table S1).

Expression of native BclA lectin in B. cenocepacia strain J2315 was tested under different growing conditions, including cultivation on minimal and rich media in the presence and absence of iron and various sugars. Finally, 4 days of cultivation on rich medium in the presence of D-mannose resulted in a reasonable amount of protein for MS analysis after purification. The results of a search using MASCOT based on the MALDI-MS and LC­ MS/MS analyses of the prepared tryptic digest against the NCBI database indicated the presence of protein BcenP_01004462 (B. cenocepacia PC184) (gi 84353445), which is a BclA orthologue from another B. cenocepacia strain. The search found five protein fragments matching the protein sequence with a final score of 77. In addition, a sixth matching fragment with a signal close to noise could be detected in the spectrum. The same result was obtained with a search against a local database containing data from B. cenocepacia strain J2315 (data from The Sanger Institute, which are not included in the NCBI sequence database). The search identified the BCAM0186 protein (chromosome 2, residues 216624­217013) that corresponds to BclA. The peptides identified in the BclA sequence are shown in Figure 2.

the purified protein per litre of culture. The resulting protein was purified by affinity chromatography on D-mannose­agarose and ran as a sharp band of approx. 14 kDa on SDS/PAGE. MS analysis confirmed the molecular mass of 13764 Da, corresponding to the BclA amino acid sequence lacking the initial methionine residue. In contrast with the other PA-IIL-like proteins, size-exclusion chromatography clearly demonstrated that BclA is a dimer in solution (Figure 3). In order to characterize further the lectin, DLS and DSC experiments were performed (see the Supplementary material at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/411/bj4110307add.htm). DLS showed the hydrodynamic size of the lectin particle to be 5 nm. This corresponds to the overall globular shape of the dimeric protein as observed in the crystal structure (see below). The thermal unfolding transition for BclA was measured using DSC + to be at 87 - 0.5 C with a calorimetric heat change ( H) to van't Hoff heat change ( Hv) ratio of approx. 0.5 (concentration normalization was carried out on a per mol of monomer basis).

An SPR binding assay was used to determine the affinity of BclA to sugars immobilized on the chip. The results show that, although BclA does not interact with fucosylated and galactosylated surfaces, it does bind strongly to the mannosylated polyacrylamide surface. Figure 4 (top, left-hand panel) shows typical sensorgrams obtained after injection of different concentrations of BclA. The association phase is rapid, but the dissociation is very limited because of the density of mannoside available for binding. The shape of the sensorgrams suggests that the lectin probably undergoes some rebinding phenomenon. The use of EDTA allows a rapid and total removal of the lectin for regeneration of the surface. The lectin preference for different monosaccharides or monosaccharide derivatives was tested by their inhibition power on the binding of circulating BclA to the mannose surface. Figure 4 (top, right-hand panel) shows the sensorgrams obtained in the presence of increasing concentrations of methyl -D-mannoside pre-incubated with BclA before injection. A concentration of 30 M significantly inhibited the binding. The experimental binding curves obtained in the presence of competing sugar were fitted using a kinetic model for 1:1 binding (see the Supplementary material). Req were calculated from fitted curves and taken as the amount of BclA bound to the chip surface in the presence of competing sugar. The IC50 values for the different compounds were derived from such competition experiments. The results show that D-mannose is an excellent inhibitor with an IC50 of 39 M (Table 2), whereas D-galactose does not bind

significantly to the lectin. Some inhibition effects are shown by the monosaccharides of the L-galacto series, such as L-fucose, Darabinose and L-galactose, but are two orders of magnitude weaker than D-mannose, indicating that BclA has a high specificity for mannose. As classically observed in lectin­carbohydrate interactions, the BclA lectin has higher affinity towards mannose derivatives with a hydrophobic aglycone group such as methyl (methyl -D-mannoside) or phenyl (benzyl -D-mannoside), with IC50 values approx. 3-fold smaller. To take into account the accessibility of the BclA-binding site, which could be modified when binding to the polymeric sugar on the surface, SPR experiments were also conducted by evaluating the direct binding of ten monosaccharides (benzyl -D-mannoside, methyl -D-mannoside, D-mannose, L-fucose, D-arabinose, methyl -L-fucoside, D-galactose, L-galactose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine) to BclA immobilized on the surface. The sugars were tested at two different concentrations: 500 M and 25 mM. Although the mannose and mannosylated derivatives already showed site saturation at 500 M (see the Supplementary material), for all of the other sugars, only partial saturation was observed (at 25 mM: L-fucose, 86 %; D-arabinose, 73 %; methyl -L-fucoside, 45 %; L-galactose, 33 %; and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and N-acetylD-glucosamine, <10 %). Such results indicate that dissociation constants for these other tested sugars are weaker than millimolar values. Since oligosaccharide specificity could be correlated with the possible function of the bacterial lectin in tissue recognition, binding to a broad spectrum glycan array was performed at the Consortium for Functional Genomics. The screening results show that BclA has a strict specificity for oligomannose-type N-glycans, only binding to oligosaccharides with an -mannoside-capped branch (Figure 5). The terminal disaccharides that are bound are -Man1­2Man, Man1­3Man and Man1­6Man, indicating that the specificity for the linkage is not strict. The lectin can

also tolerate xylose substitution on the non-terminal mannose. Hybrid structures with the presence of N-acetylglucosamine on one antenna are also recognized if terminal -mannoside residues are available on the second antenna.
Thermodynamics of binding

The three best ligands, i.e. mannose and its methyl and benzyl derivatives, were used to characterize further the interaction between BclA and its ligands by titration microcalorimetry, a method that is well suited for the characterization of protein­ carbohydrate interactions [25]. A typical titration curve for methyl -D-mannoside binding to BclA is shown in Figure 6, upper panel. Injection of the ligand yielded strong exothermic peaks in the first phase until reaching a stoichiometry close to 1. Fitting of the integrated peak values to theoretical models yielded the curves shown in Figure 6, lower panel. The fitting is not perfect for a classical one-site model, because of a clear increase in the exothermic reaction during the first ten injections. Such a phenomenon can only be explained by the existence of several binding sites that either have different stoichiometry or have binding co-operativity. Since gel-exclusion experiments demonstrated that BclA is a homodimer in solution, it is possible that binding of mannoside at one site increases the affinity of the other site. Indeed, a fitting procedure using a co-operative twosite model gave excellent agreement with the experimental data (Figure 6, lower panel). Data obtained by averaging over three experiments for mannose and its derivatives are listed in Table 3. The co-operative binding models indicate the presence of a high-affinity binding site with micromolar affinity that facilitates binding to a second site, with slightly lower affinity (7­12 M depending on the ligand), but with higher enthalpy. Since both sites do not have very different characteristics, the one-site model gives an `apparent' thermodynamic behaviour that reflects the overall binding behaviour. For

This favourable entropy of binding is unusual in protein­carbohydrate interactions, but has been reported in this Ca2+ -dependent family of bacterial lectins and is attributable to the involvement of the two Ca2+ ions in sugar binding [26,27].

the one-site model, BclA displays a very high affinity for mannose with a dissociation constant of 5 M, i.e. a much stronger affinity than classically observed for plant or animal lectins. The methyl or benzyl derivatives display twice the affinity, with a K d of 2.75 M for the interaction of BclA with methyl -D-mannoside. This micromolar affinity is due both to a strong enthalpy of binding with H values ranging between - 23 and - 27 kJ/mol and to a favourable entropy of binding with T S between 3 and 9

BclA was crystallized in presence of methyl -D-mannoside, and crystals were obtained after a few days in the presence of ammonium sulfate and PEG, in both monoclinic C2 and orthorhombic C2221 space groups. The X-ray structure of the C2 form was determined by molecular replacement using the PA-IIL structure as the probe, but was not refined further as no ligand was observed in the binding site. The C2221 form structure, diffracting to 1.7 Å resolution, was in turn determined using the C2 form co-ordinates from the first molecular replacement (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains five BclA monomers, corresponding to two dimers (on a pseudo 2-fold axis) and a half dimer (forming a dimer by a crystallographic 2-fold axis). The Nterminal extremities exhibit disorder for the first eight amino acids of chain A and the first residue of chain C that could not therefore

Dimerization is created by strong complementary packing of the hydrophobic curved -sheet to its counterpart and

via sheet extension (Figure 7A). This is the first description of a dimeric form for a bacterial lectin that is dependent on two Ca2+ ions, with all structures reported previously adopting a tetrameric organization. Each BclA monomer is associated with two Ca2+ ions and one mannose residue, the electron density of which is shown in Figure 7(B). The two ions are located close together, 3.73 ( + 0.2) Å apart, with a classical seven-ligand co-ordination, - mainly involving one loop via the side-chains of Glu109 , Asp113 , Asp115 , Asn117 and Asp118 (Figure 7C and see Supplementary Table S2 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/411/bj4110307add.htm). A second loop is involved through the side-chain of Asn28 . In addition, the acidic group of the C-terminal Gly128 of the other monomer, which is involved in the head-to-tail interaction, also participates in the co-ordination of the Ca2+ ions. The methyl -D-mannoside molecule participates directly in the co-ordination of the Ca2+ ions with hydroxy groups O2, O3 and O4, in a similar fashion to the PA-IIL­D-mannose complex [28]. The O2, O3, O4 and O6 hydroxy groups are also involved in hydrogen bonds with amino acids Asn28 , Ala30 , Glu31 , Asp110 , Asp113 , Asp115 and Asp118 , and with the terminal carboxy group of Gly128 of the neighbouring monomer (Figure 7C, and see Supplementary Table S2). Two types of hydrophobic contact can be observed. First, the methyl group at the anomeric position is close to the methyl group of Ala30 and His112 . This histidine residue has no equivalent in the other related bacterial lectins and seems to play a special role. Analysis of the electron density indicates that His112 adopts a double conformation with approx. 50/50 occupancy in all of the five binding sites. In one orientation,

similar proteins present in two opportunistic bacteria: RS-IIL from R. solanacearum [15] and CV-IIL from C. violaceum [14]. The three proteins have very similar sequences (60­ 70 % identity), with identical fold and tetrameric arrangements. The BclA protein belongs to the same family of proteins, but displays clear differences from the lectins mentioned above. The central -sandwich monomer fold is conserved, but variations in loop conformation can be observed (Figure 8A). The most visible difference is the extension of the N-terminus, with seven additional amino acids for BclA for which electron density is clearly defined, except in monomer A. The loop between strands 7 and 8 is also much longer in BclA thanks to an insertion of nine amino acids. The differences in peptide sequence also influence the oligomeric arrangement. BclA is a dimer in solution as well as in the crystal structure. Superposition of dimeric BclA on tetrameric PAIIL (Figure 8B) shows that the additional N-terminal amino acids (particularly Arg9 ) and the longer loop (particularly Pro98 ) would not allow the creation of the dimer­dimer interface that is observed in the other structures of the family. A thorough examination of the contact region also reveals that bulky amino acids such as Arg85 create steric conflicts when trying to build a tetramer by homology modelling.

it creates hydrophobic contacts with the C5 and C6 atom of the D-mannose hydroxymethyl group. In this conformation, the ND1 nitrogen of His112 can give a hydrogen bond to the sidechain of Asp110 , while its CE1 creates hydrophobic contact with CG of Glu31 , therefore creating a rather `closed' conformation of the binding site (Figure 7D). In the other conformation, the same histidine residue adopts a different side-chain orientation and makes hydrophobic contact with the hydrophobic faces of mannose (C3 and C5) and with the methyl group at C1. This is the first evidence of flexibility in the binding site of a Ca2+ dependent bacterial lectin.
DISCUSSION Novel quaternary arrangement in two Ca2+ -dependent bacterial lectins

The first crystal structure of a soluble lectin dependent upon two Ca2+ ions has been reported for PA-IIL from Ps. aeruginosa [13]. Later, two related structures have been described from

The three lectins characterized previously from opportunistic bacteria have a rather large range of specificity, each binding to several monosaccharides. Their main stereochemical requirement is the presence of one axial hydroxy group located next to two equatorial ones, a sequence that is present in L-galacto sugars (O4 is axial, and O3 and O2 are equatorial) such as L-galactose, L-fucose, D-arabinose and D-fructopyranose, but also in D-manno sugars (O2 is axial, and O3 and O4 are equatorial) such as Dmannose [12,15,29]. However, the specificity is correlated with the nature of a stretch of three amino acids located in the so-called `specificity loop'. It has been established that the sequence Ser22 Ser23 -Gly24 (in PA-IIL) does not favour the binding of mannose whereas the Ala-Ala-Asn series of RS-IIL does. A comparison showed that, in PA-IIL, Ser22 makes a hydrogen bond to the sidechain of Asp96 , preventing it from binding to O6 of mannose. We have demonstrated recently that, by mutating the specificity loop residues, the sugar specificity can be engineered, with the S22A PA-IIL mutant binding more strongly to mannose than to fucose [30]. The situation is very different in BclA since the protein has a strict preference for mannoside. The competition experiments performed using SPR indicate some inhibition power for fucose, but microcalorimetry experiments with the same monosaccharide and SPR experiments using direct binding of BclA to the fucosylated surface did not show any signal, indicating that the binding is at least 1000-fold weaker than for mannose. Indeed, the triplet in the specificity loop is Ala29 -Ala30 -Glu31 which therefore allows O6 of mannose to form a strong hydrogen bond to the sidechain of Asp110 (Figure 8D). Furthermore, it seems that fucose binding is excluded because His112 , only present in BclA, stacks favourably against C6 or C1 of mannose (depending upon sidechain orientation), but would collide with the O1 of -fucose (Figure 8C). BclA also has further differences with the other bacterial lectins when considering the interaction thermodynamics. All of the Ca2+ -dependent soluble bacterial lectins studied to date display micromolar affinity for monosaccharides [26], with a strong enthalpy of binding and a small favourable entropy, an unusual

behaviour for protein­carbohydrate interactions that has been correlated with the presence of Ca2+ [27]. All of the experiments could be fitted to a one-site model, which is in agreement with the crystal structures. BclA also displays strong affinity for mannoside, but it was not possible to fit the experimental data using a one-site model. In the case of BclA, only once cooperativity between the two binding sites of the monomers was included in the model was a good agreement between fitted and experimental curves obtained. This behaviour can be correlated with the unusual flexibility of His112 in the binding site and/or to the unusually long loop in the region of residues 90­100 that only exists in BclA. Indeed, this loop is located very close to the His112 loop of the other monomer and it can be postulated that binding of mannose in one site alters the dynamics of one loop which
c The Authors Journal compilation c 2008 Biochemical Society

in turn affects the second binding site. A molecular dynamics study will be performed for a better understanding of this unusual co-operativity mechanism.

Conclusions

Strong interest has been shown in bacterial lectins recently because of their novel structure and carbohydrate-binding modes, their high affinity for carbohydrate ligands and their possible role in host recognition, in adhesion and in biofilm formation. A series of such lectins, all based on the sequence of the PA-IIL lectin, has been identified and subsequently studied from several bacteria. They all have a common fold and tetrameric

structure, but different sugar specificities while being dependent upon a special two-Ca2+ co-ordination. The surprising discovery of several such lectins also in the genome of B. cenocepacia led to the characterization (structurally and thermodynamically) of the smallest gene product, BclA. The role of the lectin in bacterial infection has yet to be elucidated, but the present work has yielded significant progress in the elucidation of structure, affinity and specificity of this new lectin. The present study shows this lectin to have a core fold identical with that of PA-IIL, but tetramer formation is hindered because of the presence of additional loops. The BclA lectin also differs with an apparent novel co-operative binding across the dimer, compared with the purely single-site binding of PA-IIL and its

family. BclA is indeed a member of the PA-IIL lectin family, dependent on two Ca2+ ions, with a core -sheet structure, but is the first member to associate only as a dimer and to present site co-operativity. Its specificity is for mannoside sugars and the glycan array experiment shows specificity for oligomannose-type oligosaccharides that are present on human glycoproteins.
