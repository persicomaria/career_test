HRVl A, HRV2, and HRV14 were found to be resistant whereas in serotypes HRV49 and HRV89 degradation of VP2 was observed. However, exposure to low pH followed by neutralization, a treatment which causes irreversible conformational changes in the capsid, led to rapid cleavage by trypsin of VP1 in HRVl A, HRV2, and HRV49 at defined sites followed by degradation of VP2. In the case of HRV2, the cleavage site in VP1 was determined by direct protein sequencing and was shown to occur between Arg260 and Thr261, close to the C-terminus. HRV49 behaves similarly to HRV2 as expected from extensive sequence similarity in this region, whereas VP1 in HRVlA is most probably cleaved at a site closer to the Cterminus than that in HRV2. Although HRV14 contains the same amino acid pair present in HRV2 and HRV49, it was not cleaved under these conditions. HRV89, which lacks a basic residue at the corresponding position, was also insensitive. Examination of the cleavage site on the three-dimensional structural map of native HRVP reveals that it is most probably buried inside the capsid and thus not accessible. Structural rearrangements of the viral capsid are thus necessary to o w8sAcademic PWSS. IIIC. account for the cleavage observed after low pH treatment.

Human rhinoviruses, members of the picornavirus family, are known to undergo irreversible structural changes upon incubation at low pH (1). For poliovirus, similar changes have been observed which are, however, reversible upon return to physiological pH (2). It has been shown that similar changes occur also in viva during the infection cycle leading to the uncoating of the viral RNA in endosomes (3). The three-dimensional shape of several picornaviruses has been elucidated recently and casts light on their antigenic properties and the interaction of these viruses with cellular receptors (4-6). Thus, a detailed picture of the surface architecture of several representatives of the picornavirus group in their native conformation is available; however, little is known about the structural changes occurring upon transfer to a low pH environment. In an attempt to probe the surface accessibility of several rhinovirus serotypes, we examined whether conformational changes would uncover potential protease cleavage sites. Unlike poliovirus types 1 (Sabin) and 3 (Leon and Sabin), which are cleaved in their native conformation in the surface loop of VP1 which constitutes a major antigenie site (7), three of the rhinovirus serotypes examined (HRVl A, HRV2, and HRV14) were found to be stable against proteolysis by trypsin in their native state even at a 5O:l total protein:enzyme ratio, whereas in HRV49 and HRV89 VP2 was degraded (Fig. 1 two left

lanes in each case). When incubated at low pH, however, a site in VPl, suitable for cleavage by trypsin, became exposed in HRVlA, HRV2, and HRV49 and was processed in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, incubation times O-60 min). Two or more sequential cleavages were observed; processing at the first site was thus quickly followed by a second and possibly third cleavage close to the primary site as estimated from the migration of VP1 on a polyacrylamide gel. Following the time course of the digestion one can see that longer exposure to the protease led to extensive degraTABLE 1

FIG. 1. Polyacrylamide gel analysis of viral proteins of HRVl A, HRV2, HRV14, HRV49, and HRV89 after treatment with trypsin at 20" for the time periods as indicated. Viruses were grown in HeLa (Ohio) monolayers. labeled with [35S]methionine and purified as previously described (16) and mixed with bovine serum albumin (BSA) at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in order to maintain a constant protein-to-enzyme ratio during the trypsin digestions. For alteration of the capsid structure, radiolabeled virus in Tris-HCI, 10 m M (pH 7.4) MgClp, 2 m M, was incubated for 30 min at 20" with the same volume of 1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5. The sample was cooled to 0' and the same volume of cold 0.75 M Tris-base was added to bring the pH to 7.4. Native virus (protein:enzyme 50: 1, w/w) and low-pH-treated virus (protein:enzyme 500: 1, w/w) were incubated with trypsin (Miles Laboratory) at a final buffer concentration of 0.3 M Na acetate, 0.225 M Tris (pH 7.4) for 60 min (native) or for the times indicated (low-pH-treated). The digestions were stopped by addition of l/4 vol 5X Laemmli sample buffer (17) and the samples were run on 10% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of SDS (17) and fluorographed.

dation of VP2, suggesting that the cleavage of VP1 is necessary to increase the exposure of VP2. HRV14 and HRV89 showed only minimal degradation of VP2 under these conditions. It thus appears that trypsin sites in VP2 of HRV89 are accessible in the native conformation but disappear upon low pH treatment whereas HRV14 is stable in its native as well as in its low-pH-induced conformation (Fig. 1). To determine the limit of digestion of VP1 of HRV2, 2 mg of unlabeled virions was adjusted to pH 5, neutralized, and digested to completion. The truncated VP1 was eluted from a polyacrylamide gel and cleaved with CNBr, and the peptides were isolated by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a reversed-phase column as previously described (8). Comparison of the elution profile with the one obtained from CNBr peptides generated from inact VP1 revealed that the peak

on VPl. The last amino acid derived from CN8 was identified as Arg260, indicating that the cleavage had occurred between Arg260 and Thr26 1. As seen in Table 1, two additional potential trypsin cleavage sites are present four and eight amino acids, respectively, to the C-terminus from the terminal Arg in the fragment. Presumably, one of these sites is the first one which is processed in HRV2 since cleavage at Arg277/Pro278 is rare (8). An alignment of the amino acid sequences (9) in this region was examined for the presence of possible trypsin cleavage sites in the other serotypes. As seen in Table 1, no correlation between the presence of basic residues at corresponding positions and the trypsin cleavage pattern is observed, as HRV14 not only has an identical amino acid pair to the one cleaved in HRV2 but also contains several other basic amino acid residues in this region. Moreover HRV89 is also resistant against trypsin despite the presence of a Lys-Tyr pair at a position almost identical to the presumed cleavage site in HRVlA. Interestingly, VP2 in HRV14 is stable in the native as well as in the low-pH-induced conformation whereas VP2 of HRV89 is degraded only in the native conformation. The vicinity of Arg260/Thr261 of VP1 in HRV2 was examined with a PS300 Evans and Sutherland display unit using the program SYBYL and the three-dimensional map of HRV2 (based on the experimentally obtained coordinates of HRV14 (4, 10)). Figure 3 shows all atoms within a distance of 9 A of the peptide bond between Arg260 and Thr261 in VP1 as a space filling model. It can be clearly seen that the cleavage site is surrounded by tightly packed amino acid residues of the viral capsid and is thus most probably not accessible in its native conformation. Therefore a considerable displacement of the polypeptide backbone must take place upon exposure to low pH in order to allow attack by the protease. HRVl4 and HRV89 belong to the major receptor group, whereas the other serotypes examined in this study are members of the minor group (1 l- 15). The different behavior of the representatives of these two groups toward trypsin might thus reflect variations in conformation in this particular region in the Iow-pH-induced conformation. In summary we have presented results demonstrating profound changes of the capsid structure upon low pH treatment using a proteolytic enzyme to probe for the accessibility of potential cleavage sites. It is clear that residues of the C-terminus of VP1 which are buried in the capsid become accessible at low pH in HRVlA, HRV2, and HRV49. Their removal subsequently leads to exposure of VP2 which is degraded whereas VP3 remains stable.

The interest in determining the low-pH-induced conformation in more detail lies in its assumed role during the uncoating process in endosomes. Experiments aimed at investigating these structural changes during the infection pathway in more detail are in progress. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
