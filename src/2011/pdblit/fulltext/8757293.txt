Abstract The vasculitis autoantigen proteinase 3 was purified from neutrophil primary granules using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. It was shown to be free of important contaminants, was enzymatically active and was antigenic to sera containing antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies with a cytoplasmic pattern (C-ANCA) by indirect immunofluorescence. Development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that this preparation could be used to detect autoantibodies in Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis. Assays based on reverse phase HPLC-purified proteinase 3 will be valuable in diagnosis and monitoring of treatment, and should increase our understanding of the autoimmune response in primary systemic vasculitis.

ANCA in vasculitis have been identified; proteinase 3 (Pr3) is the target of ANCA producing a cytoplasmic pattern by immunofluorescence on ethanol-fixed neutrophils (C-ANCA) (Jennette et al., 1990; Jenne et al., 1990) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) is the target of ANCA producing a perinuclear pattern (P-ANCAXFalk and Jennette, 1988). Anti-Pr 3 antibodies in particular appear to have a high specificity for vasculitis, especially for Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) (Pusey and Gaskin, 1993). Other neutrophil constituents, such as cathepsin G, lactoferrin and elastase, may also be recognised by autoantibodies, but this appears to be more common in diseases outside the spectrum of primary systemic vasculitis, for example inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis (Peter et al., 1993).

At present, assays for ANCA are most commonly performed by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using ethanol-fixed neutrophils. This technique has been standardised by an international workshop (Wiik, 1989), and the required equipment is widely available in clinical immunology laboratories. However, interpretation of results is observer-dependent, and it is time-consuming to quantify antibodies by titration in large numbers of sera. Solid-phase assays can overcome these difficulties, and so both radioimmunoassays and enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) have been developed (Savage et al., 1987; Ludemann et al., 1988). These have generally employed crude protein mixtures as the solid-phase ligand, and so do not allow either the identification of the target antigen, or the distinction between antibodies to neutrophil constituents which are specific for vasculitis, and those which are not. Even the `alpha extract' (Rasmussen et al., 1990) which reliably detects anti-Pr3 antibodies contains a mixture of granule proteins; selectivity appears to depend on preferential antigen coating of the plates and requires precise manipulations of the coating conditions. Furthermore, the first phase of a study directed by the European Community BCR (Hagen et al., 1993) demonstrated that different solid-phase assays for C-ANCA using crude neutrophil extracts gave widely differing results, and indicated a need for standardised assays using purified Pr3. Purified MPO is commercially available, and the use of ELISAs for anti-MPO antibodies is increasing (Lee et al., 1990). In contrast, Pr3 is not yet widely available, and reliable techniques for purification are critical to the provision of specific assays. We have used reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (rpHPLC) to isolate Pr3 from neutrophil primary granules and have demonstrated that it can be used in ELISA to detect autoantibodies in vasculitis. 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Purification of neutrophil granules

Neutrophils were isolated from the blood of healthy donors by dextran sedimentation of erythrocytes, centrifugation of the leucocyte-rich fraction on Ficoll-Hypaque (Nycomed), and hypotonic lysis of remaining erythrocytes. Subcellular components were released by nitrogen cavitation at 350 psi for 20 min (Kontes mini-bomb cell disruption chamber, Burkhard Scientific). The cavitate was centrifuged to pellet unbroken cells and nuclei, and the supernatant was applied to the surface of chilled discontinuous gradients of Percoll (Sigma) in 38.5 ml capacity Ultraclear centrifuge tubes (Beckman), approximately 10 ml to each tube. Gradients consisted of 14 ml Percoll diluted to a density of 1.12 g/ml, underlayered beneath an equal volume of Percoll diluted to a density of 1.05 g/ml and were designed to reproduce the results of Borregaard et al. (1983). Following centrifugation for 15 min at 48000 x g (Beckman SW28 rotor), each tube contained three opaque bands, at levels corresponding to densities of 1.02-1.03 g/ml, 1.07-1.1 g/ml, 1.125-1.15 g/ml, as judged by marker beads (Pharmacia) run in a parallel gradient. The lowest band was the thickest, and was green. The same densities were reported previously for plasma membranes, secondary granules and primary granules respectively (Borregaard et al., 1983). Before further analysis, Percoll was removed from each fraction by ultracentrifugation at 180 000 X g for 120 min at 4°C (Beckman SW55 rotor). The presence of primary granules in the lowest band was confirmed by the detection of MPO in three ways: (iI by generation of a coloured product from diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide when granules were slot-blotted onto nitrocellulose, (ii) by sandwich ELISA using polyclonal and monoclonal anti-MPO antibodies (Dako), and (iii) by ELISA reactivity with human anti-MPO-containing sera. A detergent extract of this band was also antigenic to sera containing C-ANCA. Primary granules were pooled and stored at -70°C. 2.2. Separation of primary granule proteins Granules were disrupted by seven cycles of freezing and thawing, followed by sonication at 10 pm. A ten-fold excess of 0.2 M sodium acetate

Primary granules were obtained using a modification of the method of Borregaard et al. (1983).

(pH 4) was added and after 40 min at room temperature with regular mixing, insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 100 000 X g. The extract was subjected to rpHPLC on a C4 column (Vydac 214TP, 4.6 mm x 25 cm> using Gilson solvent pumps, solvent mixer, UV detector, fraction collector and control software (Anachem). Proteins were eluted in 1 ml fractions using an acetonitrile/water/O.l% trifluoroacetic acid gradient at 1 ml/min, using a modification of the methods of Gabay et al. (19891, Campanelli et al. (1990) and Wilde et al. (1990). This was designed to maximise resolution of the four `serprocidins': cathepsin G, elastase, proteinase 3 and azurocidin. These are proteins with extensive homology and similar molecular weight; the first three are serine proteinases. 2.3. Identification of proteinase 3

ing absorbance at 410 nm. Confirmation of the specificity of the reaction was achieved by inhibition experiments using cY,-proteinase inhibitor (the main physiological inhibitor of Pr3), and testing in parallel on a specific elastase nitroanilide substrate, Sue-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA. 2.3.4. Antigenicity to monoclonal antibodies Fractions were also tested for antigenicity to monoclonal antibodies to Pr3 by ELISA, in a parallel study - the second phase of the European Community BCR study on ANCA assay standardisation referred to earlier designed to examine preparations of purified Pr3 as possible solid-phase ligands. The monoclonal antibodies were kindly donated by J. Hoidal and W.L. Gross to the EC study group for confirmation of identity of chemically purified antigens. 2.4.

Eluting solvents were removed by centrifugation in a Speedvac. Fractions were resuspended in aqueous solution and separated by electrophoresis under non-reducing conditions on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE), which were subsequently silver-stained (Phast mini-electrophoresis system, Pharmacia). 2.3.2. N-terminal amino acid sequencing Selected fractions were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing by automated Edman degradation (Applied Biosystems 477a sequencer). 2.3.3. Serine proteinase activity of proteinase 3 All preparative steps were performed in the absence of proteinase inhibitors. Proteolytic activity of Pr3-containing HPLC fractions was tested using the synthetic serine proteinase substrate N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA, a nitroanilide which is cleaved to yield yellow nitroaniline (Rae et al., 1991). The substrate was used at a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml in DMSO; lo-400 ~1 was added to 0.1 M Tris/HCl/O.OS M NaCl buffer pH 8.8 containing 0.05% Triton X100 to a total volume of 1490 ~1, before adding 10 ~1 Pr3. Proteolysis was quantitated by measur-

Fractions containing Pr3 were tested for reactivity with C-ANCA containing sera by immunoblotting and by ELISA. Specificity of binding in ELISA was confirmed by comparison of binding of C-ANCA to PD-coated and uncoated wells, and to Pr3-containing and other HPLC fractions, and by specific inhibition of ELISA binding by pre-incubation with Pr3. 2.5. Development of proteinase 3 ELISA Proteinase 3 was pooled from successive runs and used to develop an ELISA. Assay conditions were optimised in preliminary experiments and finalised as follows. Pr3 was coated at 50 pi/well at approximately 3 pg/ml in 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate/carbonate buffer pH9.6 onto microtitre plates (Nunc Maxisorb) overnight at 4°C. After coating, the plates were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween (PBST). Similar washes were performed between all subsequent stages, which used 100 ~1 volumes. Test and control sera were applied at a dilution of l/100, and antibody binding was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (y chain-specific, Sigma) at a concentration of l/1000. Both incubations were

performed in PBST containing 2 g/l bovine serum albumin (Sigma) to minimise non-specific binding, at room temperature for 60 min. The revealing substrate was p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma 104) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in sodium bicarbonate/carbonate buffer pH 9.6 containing 5 mM magnesium chloride. Optical densities at 405 nm were read at 45 min in a Titertek Multiskan plate reader. After subtraction of the optical density registered by a no-serum control, results were expressed as % of the signal generated by a positive reference serum (OD at 405 nm usually 1.2-1.3), and the upper limit of the normal range was calculated from the mean of 100 blood bank normals (North London Blood Transfusion service) + 3 standard deviations. Sera taken from 27 patients with WG (all containing C-ANCA) and 28 patients with MP (14 containing C-ANCA and 14 containing P-ANCA) were tested in the ELISA; all sera were taken at the start of treatment in patients with active vasculitis.

3. Results 3.1. Purification of proteinase 3 Granule proteins extracted in sodium acetate retained antigenicity to C-ANCA sera in ELISA, and so were further purified by reverse phase HPLC. In total, 12 peaks were reproducibly present in the elution profile (Fig. 1). Probable identities were assigned according to molecular weight by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) and the elution order reported in other studies of neutrophil proteins (Gabay et al., 1989; Campanelli et al., 1990; Wilde et al., 1990). The predicted identity was confirmed for two of the serprocidins, Pr3 and Cathepsin G by N-terminal sequencing of 20 and 10 residues respectively (Fig. 31, and by reactivity with specific antibodies. Proteolytic activity of Pr3 was confirmed using the nitroanilide substrate N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA; enzyme activity was inhibited by the addition of cY,-proteinase inhibitor (Fig. 4). Failure to cleave a specific elastase substrate excluded elastase as the source of proteolytic activity. Purity of Pr3 was indicated by the presence of only a 29 kDa

In this assay, C-ANCA serum did not show significant binding to uncoated wells, and specificity of binding to Pr3 was similarly confirmed for a range of sera by comparing binding to Pr3-coated wells and uncoated wells (Fig. 6).

ods section. Optical densities produced by sera from healthy blood donors were invariably low, and these results were used to calculate a normal range. Antibodies to Pr3 were demonstrated in 37/41 C-ANCA-containing sera from patients with WG and microscopic polyangiitis (MP) and O/14 P-ANCA sera with specificity for MPO from patients with MP (Fig. 9). Sera from patients with a range of other diseases (including other forms of glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus) did not contain antibodies to Pr3.

4. Discussion Reverse phase HPLC is a powerful technique for separating proteins with marked similarities. It has previously been used to separate neutrophil granule proteins for functional characterisation (Gabay et al., 1989; Campanelli et al., 1990) and the present study has confirmed that it can be used in a single-stage purification of Pr3 from primary granules. We have demonstrated a high degree of purity and shown that antigenicity

and proteolytic activity are retained, suggesting that rpHPLC-purified Pr3 is suitable for use in immunoassays to detect autoantibodies in systemic vasculitis. This was confirmed by the finding of positive results in the majority of CANCA-containing vasculitis sera, but not in PANCA-containing or healthy control sera. Not all C-ANCA sera were positive, and this is compatible with the results of others, which suggest that a minority of C-ANCA sera in WG recognise antigens other than Pr3 (Jennette et al., 1990). Interestingly, Pr3 antibodies were seen not only in WG sera, but also in sera from some patients with non-granulomatous small vessel vasculitis, MP. This is consistent with the finding of C-ANCA by IIF in these sera, and positivity in an `alpha extract' assay (Gaskin et al., 1990), and suggests a close relationship between the two conditions, supported by common clinical findings and a similar response to treatment (Gaskin and Pusey, 1992). Other methods of purifying Pr3 have been reported, typically using a combination of chromatographic separations, exemplified by the method of Kao et al. (1988). Multiple steps will inevitably increase losses, and may also permit proteolytic autodigestion of the granule proteins if the separations are performed in aqueous solution at a favourable pH; proteinase inhibitors are then required, which usually prevent examination of the proteinase properties of the product. rpHPLC is performed in conditions which are unfavourable for enzyme activity, and the total run length is less than 2 h. Pr3 is eluted in approximately 50% acetonitrile and this can readily be evaporated to yield a lyophilised product which is not subject to proteolysis. A purification method depending on affinity for a monoclonal antibody to the C-ANCA antigen has also been reported (Niles et al., 19891, although the precise identity of the antigen was not confirmed as Pr3 at the time the method was published. Although available in certain research institutions, monoclonal antibodies to Pr3 are not commercially available, and their use has not generally been extended to affinity purification of a ligand for solid phase assays, even in the limited number of laboratories with access to them. A reliable biochemical

method of antigen purification may permit the production of further monoclonal antibodies for purification and characterisation of assay reagents. We conclude that, while the method described in our paper is by no means the only way of purifying Pr3, it may be the most appropriate for specialised laboratories. Furthermore, it is likely to be useful in studies into the pathogenesis of systemic vasculitis, in addition to providing a reagent for routine detection of autoantibodies. When solid-phase assays employing purified antigens, including rpHPLC-purified Pr3, become widely available, the clinica value of assays for ANCA will be enhanced. The use of individual neutrophil proteins will permit discrimination between antibodies likely to be vasculitis-associated (recognising Pr3 and MPO) and other less specific types of ANCA (including those which recognise cathepsin G and lactoferrin); these distinctions will no longer depend on the identification of subtle differences in immunofluorescence patterns. In long-term monitoring of therapy, easy quantification of ANCA by ELISA will identify patients with rising antibody concentrations who are at risk of vasculitic relapse (Cohen Tervaert et al., 1989). Finally, studies using purified antigens should improve our understanding of the relationship between ANCA specificity and pattern of disease, and it will be possible to prepare and characterize reagents for in vitro studies of the ANCA immune response in the pathogenesis of vasculitis.
