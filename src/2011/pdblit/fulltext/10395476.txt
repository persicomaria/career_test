Previous efforts in the search for molecules capable of blocking the associations between the activated tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors and the SH2 domain of Grb2 had resulted in the identification of 3-amino-Z-pTyr-Ac6c-Asn-NH2, a high-affinity and selective antagonist of this SH2 domain. In the present paper, we report the successful replacement of asparagine in this compound by a -amino acid mimetic, which brings us closer to our objective of identifying a Grb2-SH2 antagonist suitable for pharmacological investigations.
Introduction The adapter protein Grb2 is an essential component of the molecular machinery used by tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors to transmit mitogenic signals inside the cell.1-3 Grb2 contains a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain whose function is to specifically associate with phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-containing motifs present in the intracellular part of the activated receptors. Interruption of the transmission of mitogenic signals in deregulated cancerous cells by chemical blockade of these associations is regarded as a possible strategy to discover new antitumor agents.4-6 Using the minimal peptide sequence pTyr-Ile-Asn retaining micromolar affinity for the Grb2-SH2 domain as an initial lead structure, we have engaged in a medicinal chemistry effort based on this concept. We recently reported the structure-based design of several modifications imparting high affinity to the minimal sequence.7-9 In particular, attachment of a 3-aminobenzyloxycarbonyl (Z) N-terminal group combined with replacement of the central isoleucine residue by 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid (Ac6c) resulted in 3-amino-Z-pTyr-Ac6c-AsnNH2 (1), a potent (IC50 ) 1 nM in an ELISA assay) and selective antagonist of the Gbr2-SH2 domain. The high potency of this compound prompted us to undertake additional efforts directed at reducing its peptidic character. Along this line, we present here the design, synthesis, and confirmation of the binding mode by X-ray crystallography of an analogue of 1 in which the Asn residue has been replaced by a nonproteinogenic cyclic -amino acid mimetic without loss of activity. Design The X-ray crystal structure of the Grb2-SH2 domain complexed with the phosphotyrosyl peptide H-Lys-ProPhe-pTyr-Val-Asn-Val-NH2 (the 174-180 sequence of the BCR-abl protein) has been determined in our group.10 This has revealed with full atomic details the structural basis of ligand recognition by the Grb2-SH2 domain. One of the key elements for recognition is the

The asparagine of the ligand makes two hydrogen bonds in a bidentate manner with the backbone NH and carbonyl of Lys D6 and one hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Leu E4 (dashed lines). The -turn intramolecular hydrogen bond between the NH of residue pTyr + 3 and the backbone carbonyl of pTyr is also represented.

asparagine residue in position pTyr + 211 of the sequence of phosphopeptide ligands.12,13 In the X-ray structure, this asparagine occupies position i + 2 of a type I -turn allowing the carboxamide group of its side chain to make three specific hydrogen bonds with the peptide backbone of the SH2 domain at residues Lys D6 and Leu E414 as depicted in Figure 1. Using this structural information, we looked for possible mimetics of asparagine in 1. The C-terminal carboxamide group of 1 corresponds to the peptide bond connecting residues Asn (pTyr + 2) and Val (pTyr + 3) in the phosphopeptide of the X-ray structure. Inspection of the latter shows that this amide bond has no interactions with the SH2 domain. However, its NH group is involved in the intramolecular hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of the phosphotyrosine residue that stabilizes the -turn conformation.

replacement of Asn by -alanine, leading to a molecule which retains the capacity to make the same hydrogen bonds as with the side chain of asparagine but lacking the C-terminal carboxamide group, resulted in a dramatic loss of affinity for the Grb2-SH2 domain.15 This result suggested the importance of introducing conformational restriction in potential mimetics of the asparagine moiety. Interactive modeling based on the X-ray structure showed that it was possible to construct a ring connecting the R and carbons of the phosphopeptide asparagine while preserving the orientation of the side chain carboxamide necessary to form the three hydrogen bonds. In addition, the ring did not clash with the SH2 domain if it was built in the direction opposite to residue Trp EF1 of the protein. This led to the idea of replacing asparagine by a cyclic -amino acid, providing rigidity. Following this direction, a substructure search in the chemical archives of the company based on the query shown in Figure 2 was performed. The search returned cis-2-amino-cyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid (cis-Achec) as an available six-membered ring -amino acid synthesized in an unrelated project. Molecular modeling confirmed the suitability of this amino acid as a substitute for asparagine. As shown in Figure 3, cisAchec-NH2 constructed as the (1S,2R) enantiomer in a half-chair conformation with equatorial and axial positions for the amino and carboxy groups, respectively, can adequately mimic the asparagine of the ligand in its interactions with the SH2 domain. Thus, Asn in 1 was replaced by cis-Achec resulting in compounds 2a and 2b. Although still able to form the three hydrogen bonds with Lys D6 and Leu E4, the compound containing the (1R,2S) enantiomer of cis-Achec was expected to be less potent due to steric clash of its cyclohexene ring with the SH2 domain residue Trp EF1. Chemistry and Biology The cyclic -amino acid 3 was prepared as depicted in Scheme 1. rac,cis-7-Azabyciclo[4.2.0]-oct-4-en-8-one (4) was synthesized by known procedures16 using sodium sulfite for the reduction of the N-chlorosulfonyl -lactam.17 The cis orientation assigned to the fused -lactam is that expected for a dipolar addition of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate with olefinic substrates.17 After protection of the amino functionality with the tertbutoxycarbonyl group, the -lactam was hydrolyzed with lithium hydroxide to afford the N -Boc protected cyclic -amino acid 6. For synthetic reasons, the Boc group was removed under acidic conditions and replaced with the Fmoc group.

Compound 2 (3-amino-Z-pTyr-Ac6c-(cis)-Achec-NH2) was synthesized manually on a Rink amide MBHA resin,18 employing the Fmoc/tert-butyl strategy.19 The protected cyclic -amino acid 3 and the required NRFmoc-amino acids were incorporated to the solid support using standard coupling protocols. After completion of the synthesis, the peptide resin was simultaneously cleaved and deprotected with 95% TFA-water (19:1, v/v). The HPLC trace of the crude phosphopeptide displayed two main products with identical masses (Figure 4). As expected from the use of the racemic -amino acid 3, the two main compounds (2a and 2b) correspond to the two diastereomers of phosphopeptide 2, which were purified to homogeneity by preparative reversed-phase MPLC (Figure 4).

The errors quoted correspond to the standard error in the fits of the data. b Stereochemistry assignment based on X-ray structure.

The Grb2-SH2 inhibitory activity of compounds 2a and 2b was determined in our EGFR assay (Table 1). This assay measures the potency of a compound to inhibit the binding of the phosphorylated intracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to the Grb2-SH2 domain. The most potent diastereomer is 2b which, remarkably, has a binding affinity almost identical to that observed for our reference compound, the asparagine-containing phosphopeptide 1 (IC50 ) 1.6 nM versus 1.0 nM). In addition, we found that 2b binds selectively to the SH2 domain of Grb2 as testified by the lack of affinity of the compound for the SH2 domain of p56lck, a SH2 domain having a different specificity than that of Grb2 (no inhibition at a concentration of 10 µM in a phosphopeptide competition assay previously described9). The X-ray structure of the Grb2-SH2 domain complexed with compound 2b allowed the determination of the configuration of the cylic -amino acid in the highly potent diastereomer. X-ray Crystallography. The Grb2-SH2 domain was cocrystallized with compound 2b and the X-ray structure of the complex solved at 3.0 Å resolution. The structure revealed the expected (1S,2R) configuration of cis-2-amino-cyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid in 2b. The main interactions of the ligand with the SH2 domain are shown in Figure 5. As can be seen, the asparagine mimetic functions as designed. Its carboxamide moiety forms two hydrogen bonds in a bidentate manner with the backbone carbonyl and NH of Lys D6 and an additional one with the backbone carbonyl of Leu E4. Moreover, the structure confirms the validity of earlier design. As predicted, one observes a stacking interaction of the phenyl ring of the 3-amino-Z N-terminal group with the guanidinium moiety of Arg RA2,7 and Ac6c adopts a right-handed 310 helical conformation with its side chain making hydrophobic van der Waals contacts with Phe D5 and Gln D3.8 Other important interactions are identical to those seen in the X-ray structure of the Grb2-SH2 domain complexed with the phosphopeptide H-Lys-Pro-Phe-pTyr-Val-Asn-Val-NH2.10 In particular, the phosphotyrosine binds exactly the same way, its phosphate group forming hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Arg B5 and Arg RA2. The backbone NH of residue pTyr + 1 is also involved in a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of His D4. Conclusion In phosphotyrosyl peptides, specificity for binding to the SH2 domain of Grb2 is determined by the presence of asparagine in position pTyr + 2 of the sequence. We have identified a suitable replacement for this residue.

As shown by X-ray crystallography, the -amino acid (amino protected), cis-2-amino-cyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid, mimics the hydrogen bond interactions of asparagine with the SH2 domain in full agreement with our design. Thus with 2b, we have obtained a high-affinity ligand of low molecular weight in which two of the three initial natural amino acids of the minimal sequence have been replaced by nonproteinogenic amino acids. Furthermore, our asparagine mimetic allows the elimination of one peptide bond (the C-terminal carboxamide group involved in the -turn intramolecular hydrogen bond) compared to previously described compound 1. Therefore, the work reported here constitutes a progress in our effort to identify an antagonist of the Grb2-SH2 domain suitable for pharmacological investigations. Experimental Section

The synthesis of peptide 1 was published previously.8 Phosphopeptide 2 was synthesized manually on a 4-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl-aminomethyl)-phenoxy resin, employing the fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl strategy. Fmoc removal was with piperidine/DMA (1:4, v/v; 6 × 2 min), followed by washing with MeOH (3 × 1 min), NMP (2 × 1 min), MeOH (3 × 1 min), and NMP (3 × 2 min). Coupling was achieved by first dissolving the Fmoc-amino acid (2 equiv), DIEA (5 equiv), and HATU or TPTU (2 equiv) in NMP, waiting 3 min for preactivation, adding the mixture to the resin, and finally shaking for at least 2 h. The incorporation of 1 and Fmoc-1-aminocyclohexyl carboxylic acid was accomplished with HATU (first coupling) and TPTU (second coupling) as described above. Na-Fmoc-Tyr(PO3H2)-OH was coupled with TPTU (first coupling) and HATU (second coupling) as described above. 3-N-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-aminobenzyl-4-nitrophenyl-carbonate (3 equiv8) was coupled to the N-terminal residue of the peptide resin in the presence of an equimolar amount of DIEA in NMP during 17 h at room temperature. The complete peptide resin obtained after the last coupling step was simultaneosly deprotected and cleaved by treatment with 95% TFA/5% H2O for 3 h at room temperature. The filtrate from the cleavage reaction was precipitated in diisopropyl ether/petroleum ether (1:1, v/v, 0 °C), and the precipitate collected by filtration. The crude peptide was purified by medium-pressure liquid chromatography using a C18-column eluted with H2O/0.1% TFA (buffer A) and MeCN/0.09% TFA (buffer B): 7 min with 100% buffer A, 7 min linear gradient from 0% to 10% buffer B, 30 min from 10% to 16% buffer B, 15 min from 16% to 18% buffer B, and 7 min from 18% to 19% buffer B; detection at 215 nm.

Compound inhibition was calculated as a percentage of the reduction in absorbance in the presence of each inhibitor concentration compared to the absorbance obtained with GST/SH2 in the absence of inhibitor. Doseresponse relationships were constructed by nonlinear regression of the competition curves with Grafit (Erithacus Software, London, U.K.). Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were calculated from the regression lines (Figure 6). X-ray Crystallography. Cloning and expression of the Grb2 SH2 domain have been described earlier.10 A solution of pure protein (Grb2 55-153) was concentrated with a Centricon (Amicon Grace Company) to 10-10.4 mg/mL and mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of 2b. Small crystals of the complex with 2b were obtained after a few days in 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1.4 M sodium acetate by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with lattice constants 73.8 × 93.3 × 232.8 Å and diffract to 3.0 Å resolution. One of these crystals (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.05 mm3) was cryocooled at 100 K, and data were collected at this temperature on a MAR area detector mounted on an FR591 rotating anode X-ray generator (Enraf-Nonius) operating at 4.1 kW and producing graphite monochromated Cu KR radiation. Frames (exposure: 25 min, crystal rotation: 0.5°) were processed using the MARXDS and the MARSCALE software programs.22 The Rmerge for all data between 30.0 and 3.0 Å is 20% with a 3.9fold redundancy. The overall completeness of the data is 96%, and the same for data in the shell between 3.5 and 3.0 Å. The large crystal unit cell (1.6 × 106 Å3) indicates the presence of many molecules of the complex in the asymmetric unit (Vm ) 2.9 Å3/Da of protein for 12 protein molecules). A model comprising a dimer of the protein, which has been observed in the five different crystal forms obtained so far in our laboratory, was used as a probe for molecular replacement with the program AMORE.23 The highest 10 peaks obtained in the rotation function were applied in the translation function. Due to the weakness of the data it was not possible to define unambiguously to which orthorhombic space group the crystal belongs to. The translation function had to be repeated in the four possible space groups (P222, P2221, P21212, and P212121) plus the four axis permutations in space groups P2221 and P21212. Only the space group P212121 gave acceptable results in the calculation of the translation function, giving a strong indication that it was the correct space group. Nevertheless, the peak obtained for the first dimer was not completely convincing (correlation factor ) 0.249, Rfactor ) 0.493). In the course of iteration of the translation function with additional dimers, the correlation factor increased constantly while the Rfactor decreased considerably. After the introduction of six dimers in the model the correlation factor was 0.642 and the Rfactor 0.369. Visual inspection confirmed that the resulting packing in the crystal cell unit was reasonable. The refinement was performed with the program XPLOR, 24 and manual rebuilding of the models was performed with the program O.25 All data between 30.0 and 3.0 Å were used, and a bulk solvent correction was applied. A first cycle of rigid body refinement was performed to position the 12 molecules

EGFR Assay. The EGFR assay has already been described in detail previously.10 Briefly, phosphorylated MBP-EGFR immobilized on a solid phase (polystyrene microtiter plates, NUNC MAXYSORB) was incubated with a GST/Grb2-SH2 fusion protein capable of binding to it, in the presence of phosphopeptide in buffer or buffer alone. Bound SH2 was detected with polyclonal rabbit anti-GST antibody. Following washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit antibody was added. Peroxidase activity is monitored at 655

High-Affinity Antagonists of the Grb2-SH2 Domain more precisely. The second step consisted of refinement of the protein alone using strict noncrystallographic symmetry. Visual inspection of an electron density map confirmed the presence of the ligand in the active site and allowed its complete insertion into the model. Further refinement was performed, followed by minor modifications of the protein and addition of two solvent molecules per protein monomer. The final model consists of 96 protein residues, 53 inhibitor atoms, and 4 water molecules. The Rfactor (Rfree) dropped to 0.305 (0.318) with acceptable deviations of ideal geometry (rms deviation 0.027 Å and 2.536° for bonds and bond angles, respectively). Analysis of main chain torsion angles using PROCHECK26 showed that 86% of the residues are located in the most favored regions, the remaining 14% occurring in the additional allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. All the atoms of the inhibitor have been located within the electron density (Figure 7). The coordinates of the X-ray structure have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank with accession code 1CJ1 for immediate availability. Molecular Modeling. The modeling work was performed in MacroModel v.4.027 ("in house" version enhanced for graphics by A. Dietrich, unpublished results). Energy minimizations were performed using the AMBER force field28 in conjunction with the GB/SA water solvation model.29 The conformation of cis-Achec necessary to mimic the asparagine of 1 (shown in Figure 3) is of low energy (within 1 kcal/mol of the calculated global minimum). The two-dimensional query shown in Figure 2 and the subsequent substructure search were made using the ISIS DRAW-ISIS BASE software, version 2.1.3d (MDL). The full Novartis corporate database of compounds was searched. The search gave 10 hits from which cis-Achec was selected as an available and rigid building block.
