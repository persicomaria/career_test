ABSTRACT: Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of polyamines, and it has been identified as a drug target for the treatment of African sleeping sickness, caused by Trypanosoma brucei. ODC is a pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme and an obligate homodimer. X-ray structural analysis of the complex of the T. brucei wild-type enzyme with the product putrescine reveals two structural changes that occur upon ligand binding: Lys-69 is displaced by putrescine and forms new interactions with Glu-94 and Asp-88, and the side chain of Cys-360 rotates into the active site to within 3.4 Å of the imine bond. Mutation of Cys-360 to Ala or Ser reduces the kcat of the decarboxylation reaction by 50- and 1000-fold, respectively. However, HPLC analysis of the products demonstrates that the mutant enzymes almost exclusively catalyze a decarboxylation-dependent transamination reaction to form pyridoxamine 5-phosphate (PMP) and -aminobutyraldehyde, instead of PLP and putrescine. This side reaction arises when the decarboxylated substrate intermediate is protonated at C4 of PLP instead of at the CR of substrate. For the reaction catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme, this side reaction occurs infrequently (<0.01% of the turnovers). Single turnover analysis and multiwavelength stopped-flow spectroscopic studies suggest that for the mutant ODCs protonation at C4 occurs either very rapidly or in a concerted reaction with decarboxylation and that the rate-limiting step in the steadystate reaction is Schiff base hydrolysis/product release. These studies demonstrate a role for Cys-360 in the control of the CR protonation step that catalyzes the formation of the physiological product putrescine. The results further provide insight into the mechanism by which this class of PLP-dependent enzymes controls reaction specificity.

Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)1 is a pyridoxal 5phosphate (PLP) dependent enzyme that catalyzes the formation of the polyamine putrescine, an essential and ubiquitous cell growth factor (1). ODC has been studied as a drug target for the treatment of a number of proliferative diseases, a point illustrated by the finding that R-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a suicide inhibitor of ODC, cures African sleeping sickness and is now used clinically for treatment of the disease (2, 3).

PLP-dependent enzymes catalyze a wide range of reaction chemistry involving amino acids, including decarboxylation, transamination, racemization, - or -elimination, and carboncarbon bond formation (4). Five separate structural classes of PLP-dependent enzymes have been identified (5). All enzymes that utilize PLP in a catalytic role bind the cofactor via a Schiff base to an active site Lys residue (Lys-69 in ODC). Substrate displaces the Lys residue in a transimination reaction to form the external aldimine species (Figure 1). Formation of this species allows the cofactor to serve as an electron sink to stabilize the carbanion generated by cleavage of one of three bonds to the CR-carbon. Reaction specificity is dictated by the specific nature of the enzyme active site. For example, the CR-carboxylate bond is cleaved by decarboxylases, and the CR-proton bond is cleaved by transaminases and racemases. In the second step of these reactions, protonation occurs at CR (decarboxylation and racemization) or at C4(transamination) depending on the reaction chemistry. To control the reaction specificity, the enzyme promotes the physiologically productive reaction while limiting the vast array of potential side reactions. The fidelity of the reaction chemistry has been studied in a number of PLP-dependent enzymes. For the decarboxylases, studies on methionine (6, 7) and glutamate (8) decarboxylase found that decarboxylation-dependent transamination occurs as a rare side reaction with the physiological substrates (1 time in 104 catalytic events), while it occurs more frequently with nonphysiological substrates (e.g., for 2-methylglutamate 1% of the product

FIGURE 1: (A) Reaction mechanism for ODC. Protonation at CR leads to formation of the physiological product, putrescine, while protonation at C4 leads to transamination to form PMP and ABA. (B) Reduction of ABA produces pyrrolidine. The spectral properties of the PLP intermediates were taken from (10, 33) and represent the major band observed at pH 7.5.

is incorrectly protonated by glutamate decarboxylase). This reaction, which converts the active PLP cofactor into an inactive form, PMP, occurs if the quinoid that is generated upon decarboxylation is protonated at C4 instead of CR (Figure 1). Dunathan proposed that PLP-dependent enzymes control the bond cleavage step by orienting the scissile bond perpendicular to the plane of the  electrons of the imine bond with PLP (9). Less is known about how these enzymes control the specificity of the protonation step. The proper positioning of a general acid and/or the exclusion of water from inappropriate positions in the active site are potential mechanisms for controlling the selectivity of this step. The reaction mechanism of ODC has been studied by stopped-flow multiwavelength spectroscopy (10). Formation of the external aldimine is followed by decarboxylation to generate a putative quinoid intermediate that is protonated on the CR-carbon to produce the product putrescine (Figure 1). Product release, which includes Schiff base hydrolysis, has been identified as the likely rate-determining step in the reaction. The X-ray structures of ODC from several eukaryotic sources [mouse (11), T. brucei (12), and human (13)] have recently been solved, and the catalytic roles of a number of the active site residues have been delineated (14-16). Cys-360 was identified as the nucleophile that is labeled by the mechanism-based inhibitor DFMO (17). Further mutation of Cys-360 to Ala in both mouse (18, 19) and T. brucei (20) ODC decreases the steady-state kcat for decarboxylation of L-Orn. Comparison of the X-ray structures of unliganded ODC with the DFMO-bound enzyme shows that the side chain of Cys-360 points away from the active site in the unliganded enzyme; however, upon reaction with DFMO, the side chain rotates 145°, positioning the sulfur group to within 4 Å of the CR carbon. These data suggested that Cys360 plays a role in the reaction chemistry of the enzyme. In this paper, we demonstrate that substitution of Cys360 with either Ala or Ser alters the reaction specificity of

T. brucei ODC. Both mutant enzymes catalyze decarboxylation-dependent transamination as the primary reaction. The kcat for steady-state decarboxylation has been reduced by 50and 1000-fold for C360A and C360S ODC. Single-turnover experiments demonstrate that the rate of the decarboxylation step is also decreased by these mutations, but to a lesser extent than kcat. The rate-limiting step in the steady-state reaction is Schiff base hydrolysis/product release to form -aminobutyraldehyde (ABA) and PMP. X-ray analysis of wild-type T. brucei ODC in complex with putrescine demonstrates that rotation of the Cys-360 side chain into the active site occurs upon ligand binding and it does not depend on the formation of a covalent bond between Cys-360 and DFMO. These data demonstrate that Cys-360 is positioned to play a role in the reaction chemistry and that this role is essential for formation of the physiological product.

Methods Site-Directed Mutagenesis, ODC Expression, and Purification. The construction of the clone encoding C360A T. brucei ODC has been previously described (20). The clone encoding C360S T. brucei ODC was created by standard Kunkel mutagenesis (21) using the oligo 5-GGGGTCCCACTAGTGATGGTCTTG-3 to substitute the codon for Ser (underlined) at position 360 and to introduce a silent SpeI site. Wild-type and mutant ODCs were expressed from the cloned gene as His-tag fusion proteins in BL21/DE3 cells,

Tight noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were kept for the four monomers in the asymmetric unit until the last cycles of the refinement. Relaxation of this restraint yielded only slight structural changes. The peptide torsion angles for 1110 out of 1246 well-defined nonglycine and nonproline residues fall within the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, as defined in the program PROCHECK (29). There are no residues in disallowed regions. pH Dependence of the Spectra of PLP Bound to C360A and C360S ODC. Spectra of C360A and C360S ODC (30 µM) were recorded on a Beckman DU-650 spectrophotometer over a pH range of 7-9 using 0.1 M NaPO4 (pH 6.56.75), Hepes (pH 7-8), or Bicine (pH 8.25-9) buffers as described (16). To account for the contribution of unbound PLP, the sample was subjected to ultrafiltration using Centricon-10 units (Amicon). The flow-through for every sample was collected, and the spectra were recorded and subtracted from the corresponding initial spectra. The spectra were recalculated to millimolar absorptivities. The minimal model that describes the spectral pH titration data for C360A or C360S ODC requires a cooperative 2H+ dissociation. Millimolar absorptivities observed at 420 nm ( obs420nm) were fitted to eq 1, which describes the interconversion of the two spectrally distinct forms (E and EH2), having extinction coefficients of E420nm and EH420nm.

from the T7 promoter. The enzyme for kinetic analysis and for crystallization was purified by Ni2+-agarose column chromatography and gel filtration as previously described (10). Protein for crystallization was further purified by removal of the His-tag as described (22). The buffer in the protein samples was exchanged with 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5, using a Fast Desalting HR 10/10 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer prior to use in kinetic studies. The protein concentration in all ODC samples was determined by absorbance spectroscopy using a previously determined extinction coefficient of ) 0.85 OD (mg/mL)-1 cm-1 (20). Crystallization. The putrescine-complexed crystals were prepared as follows: ODC (25 mg/mL ODC in 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.01% Brij-20) was preincubated with D-Orn (15 mM), pH 7.5, for 10 min at room temperature before crystallization. The crystals were obtained at 16 °C by vapor diffusion, mixing equal volumes of ODC-D-Orn mixture and well solution (20% PEG 3350, 0.2 M NaOAc, 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT). This procedure resulted in mostly twinned crystals that were used for microseeding into sitting drops containing the solution described above. Most crystals grew in clusters and were twinned. However, a few single crystals were located near the edges of the drop. Crystallographic analysis indicated that the D-Orn was decarboxylated into putrescine; thus, the final structure represents ODC bound to putrescine. Samples were cryo-protected and frozen in liquid nitrogen as described previously (22). Data Collection and Processing. Diffraction data were collected at 124 K on beam line 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS, Berkeley). Data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (23). A summary of the data processing statistics is given in Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinement. Initial phases were calculated from a molecular replacement [program AMoRe (24)] solution obtained using the T. brucei ODC K69A/DFMO structure (pdb accession no. 2tod) as the search model, where DFMO was removed from the structure (12). The model was built in O (25). The structure was refined with CNS (26-28) using molecular dynamics and energy

Like wild-type ODC, significant loss of PLP from the active sites of C360A or C360S ODC did not occur until the pH was above 9.0. Steady-State Analysis of the Reaction of L-Orn with ODC by Determination of CO2 Production. Decarboxylation was followed at 37 °C using a modification of the previously described spectrophotometric assay where CO2 production is coupled to NADH oxidation via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase (20). The following reaction conditions were used: 0.1 M Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.32 mM NADH, 2.2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 0.05-0.2 mM PLP, 0.25-10.0 mM L-Orn, 10% reagent B (Sigma CO2 detection kit 132-B which contains 2.5 units/mL plant phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and 15 units/mL porcine heart malate dehydrogenase), and ODC (wild-type ODC, 5-50 nM; C360A ODC, 1-4 µM; C360S ODC, 2-10 µM) in a final volume of 0.5 mL. Absorbance units were converted to moles of CO2 produced based on the extinction coefficient of NADH (6.2 mM-1 cm-1) and the assumption that 1 mol of CO2 is produced for every mole of NADH oxidized. Single TurnoVer Kinetic Analysis of the Reactions of ODC with L-Orn. Single turnover data were collected under conditions in which the concentration of ODC (0.05-1.1 mM) was in excess over the concentration of 1-14CO2-LOrn (17 µM). At various time points, the reaction was quenched with NaOH (1 M) and cold L-Orn (25 mM). 14CO2 was driven from solution by acidification (6 M HCl), and the unreacted 1-14CO2-L-Orn was quantitated by scintillation counting. This method was used previously to monitor

the decarboxylation rate for K69A ODC (14); however, because this mutant enzyme catalyzed the reaction very slowly, rapid mixing protocols were not required. For wildtype, C360A, and C360S ODC, the reaction occurred fast, and quenching was performed in an SFM4 mixer (Biologic, France) equipped with a quench-flow exit valve, no delay line in DL1, and a 0.09 mL delay line in DL2. The exact mixing protocol was as follows. The four syringes are set up with the following reaction components: syringe 1 (S1; 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5); syringe 2 (S2; 0.1-2.2 mM ODC in 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5); syringe 3 (S3; 34 µM, 1.7 µCi/ mL, 1-14CO2-L-Orn diluted in 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5); and syringe 4 (S4, 2 M NaOH with 50 mM L-Orn). The mixer is purged with 0.2 mL from S1, 0.05 mL from S2, and 0.05 mL from S3, followed by 0.7 mL from S1. This mixture is discarded. After 2.5 s, which allows for the collection tube to be positioned, the mixer is primed with 0.024 mL of ODC from S2, and the reaction is initiated with 0.054 mL from both S2 (ODC) and S3 (1-14CO2-L-Orn). After the sample is allowed to age, the reaction is collected by expelling with 0.34 mL of buffer from S1 and quenched with 0.34 mL from S4 (NaOH and L-Orn). Aging times were obtained using interrupted flow. The decay of 14CO2 from solution under single turnover conditions (e.g., [E] . [S]) follows first-order kinetics, and the data were fitted to eq 2A to obtain kobs (the observed first-order rate constant for the decarboxylation of L-Orn), where b is an offset to account for a nonzero baseline.

Pre-Steady-State Kinetic Analysis of the Reaction of L-Orn with ODC by MultiwaVelength Stopped-Flow Spectroscopy. The pre-steady-state kinetics of C360A and C360S ODC reacting with L-Orn were monitored using a Biologic SFM3 mixer equipped with a TC-100 quartz cell (path length of 1 cm) coupled to a J&M Tidas16 256 diode array for multiwavelength data collection (Molecular Kinetics, Pullman, WA). The SFM3 using the TC-100 cell has a dead time of 3 ms with a flow velocity of 12 mL/s. The diode array has a spectral acquisition time of 0.8 ms at a wavelength resolution of 2.1 nm over a range of 190-730 nm. The mixer parameters and reaction setup were as previously described (10). The final mixtures contained L-Orn (10 mM), ODC (0.12 mM ODC), and buffer (0.1 M Hepes,

pH 7.5). Multiwavelength data were collected from 310 to 500 nm over 3-60 000 ms. A typical collection regime is as follows: a spectrum was collected every 1 ms for the first 250 ms, every 50 ms for the next 10 s, and every 1000 ms for the final 60 s. Multiwavelength data were analyzed using Specfit 2.12 (Spectrum Software Associates, Chapel Hill, NC) which uses singular value decomposition (SVD analysis) to solve for the spectral eigenvectors (31). The eigenvectors were then used to reconstruct the spectra of chemical species and their kinetics using a model-dependent multivariate least-squares implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (32). The data for C360A and C360S ODC were fitted to a threestep model (Scheme 2). Steady-State Analysis of the Reaction of L-Orn with ODC by Chromatographic Determination (HPLC) of Product Formation. ODC (0.5 µM for wild-type ODC, 2.5 µM for C360A ODC, and 4.5 µM for C360S ODC) was incubated with L-Orn (2 mM) and PLP (0.2-2 mM) in buffer (15 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mM DTT) for a range of times (60-8000 s) at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of TCA (final concentration of 4%). Cadaverine (final concentration 0.15-0.3 mM) was added as an internal standard. An aliquot of the sample was treated with NaBH4 (10 mg/mL for 5 min at ambient temperature). Aliquots (2-4 µmol) of both the NaBH4-treated and the untreated samples were derivatized using the AccQ,TAG kit (Waters, Milford, MA). Derivatized ligand was analyzed by HPLC on an AccQ,TAG column equilibrated with buffer A (140 mM sodium acetate, 17 mM triethylamine, pH 5.1) and eluted with the following gradient: 0 min, 0% B; 1 min, 5% B; 10 min, 30% B; 35 min, 100% B; where B is 60% acetonitrile. The column was calibrated using the retention times (RT) of the following standards (25-100 pmol) derivatized as above: L-Orn (RT ) 13.3 min), putrescine (RT ) 19.0 min), cadaverine (RT ) 21.2 min), pyrrolidine (RT ) 15.6 min), PMP (RT ) 13.0 min). The concentration of putrescine, pyrrolidine, and PMP in the analyzed samples was determined from a standard curve generated from known concentrations of the compounds, with respect to the internal standard. A conversion factor for ABA was generated assuming 1 mol of ABA is converted to 1 mol of pyrrolidine upon reduction. Rates of product formation (putrescine, pyrrolidine, ABA, or PMP) were calculated from reaction mixtures in which <25% of the PLP and L-Orn were consumed. For wild-type ODC, the transamination rate was determined by following the decrease in absorbance at 420 nm. Data were collected in 0.1 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, over a time range of 2-3 min after mixing L-Orn (250 mM) with ODC (25 µM). The steady-state rate was estimated from the initial rate phase of the curve. Absorbance units of PLP were converted to moles using the extinction coefficient for PLP (4.4 mM-1 cm-1 at 420 nm). RESULTS X-ray Structure Analysis of Wild-Type T. brucei ODC Bound to Putrescine.

mutant K69A in complex with DFMO (12). In the native structure, the side chain of Cys-360 is rotated out of the active site, but in the DFMO-bound structure, the Cys-360 side chain points into the active site, forming a covalent bond with the CR-methyl group of DFMO. The rotation of Cys360 into the active site suggests that it may be involved in the chemistry of catalysis; however, because of the covalent nature of the interaction between Cys-360 and DFMO, this structure may not be representative of the position of Cys360 in the substrate-complexed structure. Further, none of the current structures of any eukaryotic ODC determine the position of Lys-69 in the presence of a bound ligand. To address both questions, we determined the X-ray structure of T. brucei ODC bound to putrescine. Crystals were grown in the presence of D-Orn as described under Experimental Procedures. D-Orn binds T. brucei ODC (Kd ) 0. 27 mM), but it is not decarboxylated during the time course of a standard assay (2 h at 37 °C, 50 mM D-Orn, 0.01 mM ODC). Data were collected, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using the T. brucei K69A DFMO bound structure as the search model (Table 1). The crystals belong to space group P21 (a ) 67.3 Å, b ) 151.6 Å, c ) 86.4 Å, ) 103.2°) and diffract to 2.0 Å resolution. Two homodimers occupy the same asymmetric unit. Rep-

resentative electron density in the active site region of the molecule is displayed in Figure 2. Electron density is observed for the side chain of the bound ligand. Surprisingly, no electron density was observed for the CO2 moiety of D-Orn, strongly suggesting that D-Orn was decarboxylated in the crystal to form putrescine. While D-Orn is not decarboxylated during the course of a standard assay, the extended time of incubation between D-Orn and enzyme during crystallization allows decarboxylation of the nonphysiologic stereoisomer to occur. Thus, this X-ray structure represents the structure of the wild-type enzyme in complex with the product putrescine. The final model comprises 1496 residues of 4 noncrystallographic symmetry-related T. brucei ODC protein chains, 4 PLP, 4 putrescine, and 380 water molecules. The R-factor is 23.7% (Rfree ) 28.0%) for 8-2.0 Å resolution (F > 0) data, with the model constrained to preserve noncrystallographic symmetry. When noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were relieved, only slight differences between the subunits were observed. Regions including the Nterminus (residues 1-13), the C-terminus (residues 409425), and two loops (residues 160-164 and residues 297311) were disordered, and the density could not be interpreted. However, interpretable electron density was observed for

11252 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 37, 2000 amino acid residues 14-30 in all monomers and for residues 410-422 in two of the four monomers. These regions of the structure were disordered in both of the previous T. brucei ODC structures (12). There were indications of double occupancy in the active site, with both putrescine-bound and unliganded molecules contributing to the density. The Lys69 NZ and putrescine CR positions have variable electron density in the four active sites. As was observed in the DFMO-bound structure, the side chain moiety of putrescine is in an extended conformation and forms interactions between the -amino group of the ligand and two Asp residues (Asp-361 and Asp-332) from different monomers (Figure 2A). In comparison to the unliganded native structure, only two significant structural rearrangements are observed. First, Cys360 is rotated toward the active site (Figure 2A), positioning the sulfur to within 3.4 Å of the CR-carbon of putrescine (it is 6.8 Å away in the native structure). The position of the Cys-360 side chain is similar to that observed in the DFMObound structure. Second, Lys-69 swings away from the C4 atom of PLP, breaking the Schiff base bond to form new interactions with Glu-94 and Asp-88 from the same subunit (Figure 2B). This structural change provides putrescine access to the cofactor to form a Schiff base with PLP in place of Lys-69. These data suggest that Glu-94 and Asp88 prevent Lys-69 from displacing the substrate during the course of the reaction, explaining why mutation of either residue to Ala decreases the steady-state kcat for the reaction with L-Orn by 30- and 200-fold, respectively (15). UV/Vis Spectral Analysis of C360A and C360S ODC. Similarly to wild-type ODC, C360A and C360S ODC display absorption spectra for the enzyme-bound PLP cofactor with band maxima at 335 and 423 nm (Figure 3), which are characteristic of a Schiff base between Lys-69 and PLP (internal aldimine; Figure 1). The relative intensities of the two bands change with pH, such that the 335 nm band increases, while the 423 nm band decreases with increasing pH. The simplest model that describes the pH titration requires two spectrally distinguishable forms, interconverting with a cooperative 2H+ transition, where both groups have the same pKa (Figure 3 insets). The pKa's of the titrating group(s) are 8.5 ( 0.1 for C360A ODC and 8.3 ( 0.1 for C360S ODC. These data are nearly identical to the data obtained for the wild-type enzyme (pKa ) 8.7). For the wildtype enzyme, the 423 nm band has been proposed to arise from the PLP species where both the imine nitrogen and the pyridine nitrogen are charged (16). Either deprotonation of the pyridine nitrogen or formation of a tetrahedral adduct by addition of a deprotonated nucleophile (e.g., Cys) to the imine double bond could give rise to the 335 nm band at high pH (16). Cys-360 would be expected to have a pKa in the range of the titrating group and is within 3.4 Å of the imine bond. However, the finding that mutation of Cys-360 to Ala or Ser results in the same spectral pH titration as for wild-type ODC suggests that this residue is not involved in the spectral pH titration. Previous analysis of E274A ODC suggested that the spectral change corresponded to loss of the proton on the pyridine nitrogen (16). Steady-State Analysis of C360A and C360S ODC. Steadystate kinetic analysis of the decarboxylation of L-Orn catalyzed by C360A and C360S ODC was followed by measuring CO2 formation in a coupled enzyme assay in the

presence of excess PLP (Experimental Procedures). Mutation of Cys-360 to Ala or to Ser decreases the kcat for the decarboxylation of L-Orn by 50- and 1000-fold, respectively, while the Km for the reaction decreases by 5-10-fold, such that the effects of the mutations on kcat/Km are 14- and 130fold for C360A and C360S ODC, respectively (Table 2). The kinetic term, kcat/Km, is sensitive to the steps in the reaction up to the first irreversible step, which in this reaction is decarboxylation. Thus, the steady-state data demonstrate that Cys-360 plays a role in facilitating both halves of the reaction, e.g., steps up to and including decarboxylation and those that occur after decarboxylation. Because the effects on kcat are larger than on kcat/Km, mutation of Cys-360 has a larger effect on steps that occur after decarboxylation. To measure these effects directly, single turnover and pre-steadystate kinetic analyses were performed. Single TurnoVer Analysis of the Reaction of C360A, C360S, and Wild-Type ODC with 1-14CO2-L-Orn. The intermediates formed during the reaction of wild-type ODC with L-Orn were previously characterized by stopped-flow multiwavelength spectroscopy (10). The data suggested that the decarboxylation step occurred with a rate constant of 20

s-1, while the overall rate-limiting step of the reaction was product release, which occurred at 1 s-1 (at 4 °C). Both rate constants were estimated to be 10-fold faster at 37 °C, and at this temperature, Schiff base formation was complete during the dead time of the mixer (<3 ms). The quantitation of CO2 formed during the reaction of 1-14CO2-L-Orn with ODC under single turnover conditions ([ODC] . [L-Orn]) measures the kinetics of the reaction steps up to and including decarboxylation. Reaction steps that occur after decarboxylation (CR-protonation and product release) do not contribute to the observed kinetics in this analysis. The single turnover decarboxylation rate can be limited by the rates of Schiff base formation or by decarboxylation; thus, the method provides an alternate method to measure the minimal rate of the decarboxylation step. The reaction of 1-14CO2-L-Orn with wild-type, C360A, and C360S ODC was followed under single turnover conditions at 37 °C. The single turnover reaction for wild-type ODC was also monitored at 4 °C for comparison to the prior results obtained by stopped-flow multiwavelength spectroscopy. The decay of 1-14CO2 from the reaction solution follows first-order kinetics (Figure 4), and the data were fitted to eq 2A to obtain kobs. The kobs values obtained at different enzyme concentrations were well fit by eq 2B (Figure 4 insets), which describes a one-step binding reaction followed by an irreversible decarboxylation step (Scheme 1). The kinetic parameters (kdecarb and Km.decarb; Table 2) were determined from the fit. The first-order rate constant, kdecarb, represents the ratelimiting step up to and including the decarboxylation step. For wild-type ODC, the single turnover rates at 4 °C are in excellent agreement with the rates of decarboxylation measured in the stopped-flow spectral analysis, confirming the assignment of the rate constant. Compared to the wildtype enzyme, kdecarb is decreased by 12- and 65-fold for Cys360A and C360S ODC, respectively. For all three enzymes, kdecarb is significantly faster than the overall steadystate rate (kcat), showing that the decarboxylation step is not rate-limiting for either the wild-type or the mutant enzymes.

are sensitive to the electronic and tautomeric state of the cofactor providing a mechanism to monitor the formation and decay of key reaction intermediates. The reactions of C360A and C360S ODC with L-Orn (10 mM) were followed by multiwavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy at 37 °C (Figure 5). For both mutant enzymes, three kinetic phases are observed. The first phase is characterized by an increase in absorbance at 423 nm. This phase is followed by a decrease in the absorbance at 423 nm, concomitant with an increase in absorbance at 335 nm. The final slow phase is characterized by a continued decrease in absorbance at 423 nm for both mutants. For C360A ODC, a blue shift in the 335 nm band is also observed in the final stages of the reaction, while for C360S ODC a decrease in absorbance at 335 nm is observed. In addition for C360A ODC, the 423 nm peak is asymmetric at some of the intermediate time points, suggesting that multiple species may contribute to the spectra. In contrast, for C360S ODC the bands at both 335 and 423 nm are symmetric at all time points.

Global kinetic analysis of the multiwavelength data (310500 nm) was performed as described under Experimental Procedures. The data were well fit by a three-step sequential model (Scheme 2) in which intermediates A-D form and decay as described by three rate constants (kobs1, kobs2, kobs3). The model-derived spectra of the intermediates for C360A ODC are displayed in Figure 6. The analysis produced similar results for the C360A and C360S mutants, except that the species arise at different rates in the two mutants. The analysis was not able to resolve any additional species in the case of C360A ODC, despite the asymmetric nature of some of the spectra. The spectra of intermediates A and B are characteristic of either the internal or the external aldimine species (Figure 1), suggesting that A represents the internal aldimine with Lys-69 (starting spectra), that B represents the external aldimine with L-Orn, and that Schiff base formation is described by kobs1. The spectra of intermediates C and D are characterized by an intense band at 335 nm, with little to no 423 nm band character. Spectral analysis of PLP-dependent aminotransferases [e.g., aspartate aminotransferase (33)] demonstrates that these spectra are

characteristic either of a ketimine intermediate or of PMP. A spectral species consistent with PMP is not formed upon similar incubation of these mutant enzymes with putrescine, suggesting that a decarboxylation-dependent transamination is catalyzed by the mutant enzymes. These results are consistent with a reaction in which the quinoid intermediate is incorrectly protonated on C4 instead of at CR, to produce the ketimine intermediate, followed by Schiff base hydrolysis/product release to form PMP and ABA (Figure 1). For both mutant enzymes, the magnitude of kobs2 is the same as kdecarb measured by single turnover analysis, while kobs3 is similar in magnitude to kcat obtained by steady-state analysis (Table 2). These data suggest that kobs2 represents the decarboxylation/protonation steps to form ketimine and that kobs3 represents product release (which is likely to be dominated by Schiff base hydrolysis) to form PMP and ABA.

Reaction Specificity of Ornithine Decarboxylase Product Analysis of the Steady-State Reaction of L-Orn with Wild-Type, C360A, and C360S ODC by HPLC. To confirm that the formation of the 335 nm absorption band during the reaction with L-Orn results from a decarboxylation-dependent transamination event, the reaction products were analyzed by HPLC after derivatization using the AccQ, TAG kit (Waters, Milford, MA). The AccQ,TAG column was calibrated using known concentrations of derivatized L-Orn, putrescine, and pyrrolidine. If L-Orn undergoes both decarboxylation and transamination, the expected product is ABA. While no good commercial source of ABA exists to serve to standardize the column, reduction of ABA with NaBH4 produces pyrrolidine (Figure 1B), which is commercially available. Thus, reaction products were analyzed both before and after NaBH4 reduction, and pyrrolidine was used as a standard for the decarboxylation-dependent transamination reaction. The analysis provided good chromatographic separation of all major substrate and product species, allowing the rates of formation of putrescine, PMP, pyrrolidine, and ABA to be determined. Cadaverine was added to all samples as an internal standard for quantitation. The reaction of ODC with L-Orn (2 mM) was carried out in the presence of excess free PLP (0.2-2 mM) so that PMP formed during the reaction could be exchanged for free PLP to restore the catalytically competent form of the enzyme. For wild-type ODC, the reaction with L-Orn produced putrescine (Figure 7A). A small peak is observed at the retention time of pyrrolidine in the NaBH4 reduced sample. However, this peak was also present in control samples containing putrescine and the other assay components without enzyme. There is no evidence for PMP or ABA formation in any of the wild-type samples. In contrast, for C360A ODC, two additional peaks are observed in the NaBH4 reduced sample corresponding to pyrrolidine and to PMP (Figure 7B). In the nonreduced sample, a novel peak is present with a retention time of 12.5 min. This peak disappears upon reduction, allowing the peak to be assigned to ABA. Similar results were obtained for C360S ODC (data not shown). The rates of product formation were determined using the HPLC assay (Table 3). For steady-state analysis of the reaction rates, the reactions were followed for multiple turnovers (25-250 for C360A; 20-100 for C360S ODC; 200-600 for wild-type ODC) corresponding to depletion of no more than 25% of either L-Orn or PLP during the reaction. At longer incubation times, both C360A and C360S ODC were capable of driving the near-complete conversion of PLP to PMP. Thus, PMP readily exchanges with PLP to allow multiple turnovers of the reaction, consistent with the finding that the affinity of the enzyme for PMP is weaker than for PLP (16). In short, PLP functions as a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by the mutant enzymes. For wild-type ODC, the rate of putrescine formation is in excellent agreement with the rate of steady-state decarboxylation (Table 2). For C360A and C360S ODC, putrescine formation accounts for only 10% of total product formation, while ABA, quantitated by ABA in the nonreduced samples or by pyrroldine in the reduced samples, accounts for 90%. The rate of PMP formation is similar to the rate of ABA formation. These data demonstrate that for the mutant enzymes 90% of the substrate that is decarboxylated goes on to be transaminated. The rates of product formation catalyzed by C360S ODC are about 10-fold slower than for

C360A ODC; however, the product ratios (putrescine/ABA) are similar for the two mutant enzymes. For wild-type ODC, decarboxylation-dependent transamination could not be detected by the HPLC assay. However, in the presence of a large excess of substrate (L-Orn ) 250 mM), which allows the reaction to be followed for many

11256 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 37, 2000 turnovers, conversion of PLP to PMP could be detected by following the absorbance change of the cofactor at 420 nm. The rate of PMP formation was determined during the steady-state phase of this reaction. For wild-type ODC, decarboxylation-dependent transamination occurs in only 1/104 catalytic events (ktransam ) 0.001 s-1). Thus, for C360A ODC, the rates of the transamination side reaction (Table 3) have increased by 200- and 30-fold, while the rates of the on-pathway reaction to produce putrescine have decreased by 600- and 4000-fold for C360A and C360S ODC, respectively. DISCUSSION The PLP cofactor is inherently capable of catalyzing a wide range of reactions, including decarboxylation, racemization, and transamination of L-amino acids. The reaction specificity of a PLP-dependent enzyme is therefore dictated by the specific nature of the enzyme active site, which promotes the physiological reaction, while discouraging potential side reactions. As has been reported for other PLPdependent decarboxylases (6-8), wild-type T. brucei ODC is capable of a very high level of reaction fidelity. The enzyme promotes decarboxylation of L-Orn to produce putrescine almost exclusively. The one observed side reaction, decarboxylation-dependent transamination to produce -aminobutyaldehyde (ABA) and PMP, occurs at a rate that is approximately 104-fold slower than the preferred reaction. In contrast to the high level of reaction specificity that is achieved during catalysis by wild-type ODC, mutation of the active site residue Cys-360 to either Ala or Ser converts ODC into a decarboxylation-dependent transaminase. For the reaction of the C360A and C360S mutant enzymes with L-Orn, ABA represents 90% of the product that is formed, while putrescine is produced in only 10% of the catalytic events. This change in reaction specificity is a result of both an increase in the rate of the side reaction to produce ABA (200-fold for C360A and 30-fold for C360S) and a decrease in the observed rate of putrescine formation (600-fold for C360A and 4000-fold for C360S). ABA formation would be promoted along the reaction pathway if the decarboxylated substrate (quinoid) intermediate is protonated at C4 instead of at CR (Figure 1). Mutation of Cys-360 allows protonation of C4 by H2O (or another acid in the active site) to compete effectively with the reaction at CR. Thus, the mutant enzyme remains capable of selectively cleaving the correct bond between CR and CO2, but is incapable of correctly performing the protonation reaction. The X-ray structure of T. brucei ODC bound to putrescine demonstrates that the Cys-360 side chain rotates into the active site upon ligand binding, positioning the sulfur to within 3.4 Å of the CR-carbon. These data are consistent with a role for Cys-360 as a general acid to guide correct protonation of the decarboxylated reaction intermediate at CR. The finding that Ser, which has a similar size to Cys but a much higher pKa, is unable to replace the function of Cys is also consistent with this hypothesis. A Cys residue has recently been shown to serve as a general acid in the reaction catalyzed by T. cruzi S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, contributing specifically to the steps involved in Schiff base formation and hydrolysis (34). However, the high pKa of the hydroxyl group may not be the only factor affecting the ability of the Ser side chain to replace the function of the Cys residue. The Ser side chain

Jackson et al. may also be unable to fully rotate into the active site. As an alternative to functioning as a general acid, Cys-360 may serve to inhibit access of water to the C4 atom, thereby preventing the transamination side reaction. For wild-type ODC, the rate of the decarboxylation step had previously been assessed by multiwavelength stoppedflow analysis at 4 °C (10). Measurement of the decarboxylation reaction under single turnover conditions provides an alternate method to determine the minimal rate of the decarboxylation step. For wild-type ODC, the decarboxylation rate measured in the single turnover reaction (Table 2) is in excellent agreement with the rate of decarboxylation determined by stopped-flow spectroscopy (10), confirming the assignment of the observed spectral change to the decarboxylation step. For the C360A and C360S mutant enzymes, the rate of single turnover decarboxylation reaction decreased by 12- and 65-fold, respectively, in comparison to the wild-type enzyme. This rate could be limited either by Schiff base formation or by the decarboxylation step. However, like the wild-type enzyme, the multiwavelength stopped-flow data (below) suggest that Schiff base formation is faster than the single turnover decarboxylation rate and, thus, the method provides a measure of the decarboxylation step. Furthermore the observed carbon-13 isotope effect for C360A ODC was near the intrinsic level, suggesting that the decarboxylation step occurs at a slower rate than Schiff base interchange (35). Therefore, Cys-360 plays a role in facilitating decarboxylation. Global kinetic analysis of the pre-steady-state spectral data for the reaction of L-Orn with C360A and C360S ODC demonstrates that both reactions are well fit by a simple three-step sequential model (Scheme 2). The model-derived spectral characteristics of the intermediates are consistent with a reaction mechanism in which formation of the external aldimine (species B) occurs with a rate constant of kobs1 (Table 2). This step is followed by slower formation of the ketimine intermediate (species C) with a rate constant of kobs2 and by formation of products (species D) with a rate of kobs3 (Table 2). For wild-type ODC, Schiff base formation with L-Orn occurs in the dead time of the mixer (>500 s-1 at 37 °C). The mutations at C360 slow the rate of this step (kobs1) by at least 10-fold. These data suggest a role for Cys-360 in the acid/base chemistry of Schiff base formation. In the next step, ketimine formation (species C) occurs at the same rate as the single turnover decarboxylation step for both mutant enzymes (kobs2 ) kdecarb), providing strong evidence that the rate-limiting step in ketimine formation is decarboxylation. Thus, either protonation at C4 to form the ketimine intermediate must occur in a concerted reaction with decarboxylation, or the rate of the protonation step is very fast in comparison. Finally, the magnitude of kobs3 is very similar to the steadystate kcat measured for both mutant enzymes, suggesting that this step represents Schiff base hydrolysis to form the products, PMP and ABA, or the rate of release of one of the two products. Thus, as for wild-type ODC, Schiff base hydrolysis/product release remains the rate-limiting step; however, the rate of this step has been slowed significantly. This finding is not surprising considering that the acid/base chemistry of the enzyme active site is optimized to cleave a Schiff base bond between the R-amino group and C4 and not to cleave the bond between the R-amino group and CR.

Reaction Specificity of Ornithine Decarboxylase In support, carbon-13 isotope data suggest that the off-rate of L-Orn was not altered by the mutation. For wild-type ODC, the carbon-13 isotope data (12k/13k ) 1.033) suggest that the rate of the decarboxylation step is similar to the rate of Schiff base hydrolysis to release L-Orn (35). For C360A, the decarboxylation rate has been slowed by 12-fold in comparison to the wild-type enzyme, yet the carbon-13 isotope effect (12k/13k ) 1.0525) is near the intrinsic limit. Since the decarboxylation rate is only 12-fold slower in the mutant enzyme, any slow-down in the off-rate of L-Orn relative to wild-type ODC would have been expected to suppress the isotope effect below the intrinsic limit. In summary, Cys-360 has a catalytic role in three of the essential reaction steps catalyzed by ODC: Schiff base formation, decarboxylation, and protonation. Analysis of the kinetic mechanism of the K69R mutant T. brucei ODC demonstrated that Lys-69 also played multiple roles in the catalytic mechanism, catalyzing Schiff base formation, Schiff base hydrolysis, and decarboxylation (14). Thus, it appears likely that the ODC active site has been optimized to utilize active site residues in multiple roles, suggesting that the catalytic residues in the active site act synergistically to stabilize the multiple transition states formed during the reaction pathway. Despite the fact that the PLP cofactor is capable of catalyzing such diverse chemistry, few mutagenesis experiments that alter reaction specificity, as opposed to substrate specificity, have been reported. Aspartate aminotransferase was converted by three active site mutations into a -decarboxylase, a reaction that is not catalyzed to a significant extent by the wild-type enzyme (36). The change in reaction specificity occurred as a result of both an increase in the novel decarboxylase activity and a decrease in the physiological transaminase activity. Likewise, the change in reaction specificity for C360A and C360S ODC occurrs both because of an increase in the rate of the side reaction transamination and because of a decrease in the rate of the physiological reaction. Engineering novel reaction specificity into PLP-dependent enzymes will require a thorough understanding of the structural features in the active sites that control this specificity. To understand the structural basis for the reaction specificity in ODC, two steps need to be considered: (1) How does the enzyme control bond cleavage to the CR-carbon, and (2) how does the enzyme control the protonation of the decarboxylated reaction intermediate to form putrescine? These data demonstrate that Cys-360 is a major determinant in the control of the protonation step. Finally, mutation of Cys-360 provides a strategy for creating a novel transaminase activity in this class of PLP-dependent enzymes. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We are grateful to L.
