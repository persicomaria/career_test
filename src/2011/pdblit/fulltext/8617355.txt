The structure of the wild-type human procathepsin B has been re®ned to a crystallographic R-value of 0.18 and R-free of 0.23 exploiting the data Ê obtained from new crystals that diffract beyond 2.5 A resolution. The structure con®rms two previously presented, lower-resolution structures. The structure of the propeptide chain folds on the surface of the enzyme domains and blocks access of substrate to the already formed active site. Abundant solvent molecules ®ll the cavities between the propeptide and the enzyme part of the molecule. The propeptide structure is compared with a substrate model in the S2, S1, S1H and S2H binding sites. In this crystal form the cathepsin B occluding loop residues adopt yet another conformation. The structures show that the occluding loop region between the residues Cys108 and Cys119 behaves quite independently from the rest of the structure and easily adapts to changes in environment. The variety of the observed conformations of the occluding loop is in agreement with other data showing that the loop is responsible for limiting cathepsin B activity to that of a carboxydipeptidase. The region before Cys108 is essentially the same as in the mature structure, whereas the region from Cys119 to Thr125 is raised compared to the mature form by the propeptide squeezed between it and the enzyme domains, surface. The structure strongly suggests that processing of procathepsin B during its autoactivation is not unimolecular.

Introduction
Most proteases are synthesized as inactive precursors, which represent a natural control of activity (Neurath, 1984, 1993). Under certain physiological conditions these zymogens are converted to the mature active enzymes by limited proteolysis, either by other proteases or by autocatalysis (Kassel & Kay, 1973). Lysosomal cysteine proteases are synthesized as glycosylated precursors and undergo proteolytic maturation to active enzymes (Nishimura et al., 1988; Kominami et al., 1988). Their major role is intracellular protein degradation and turnover (Bond & Butler, 1987) and antigen processing (Guagliardi et al., 1990). The proteolytic

activity of these proteases is involved extracelluÂ larly in bone remodeling (Delaisse & Vaes, 1992) and in many pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (Cataldo et al., 1991), osteoporosis Â (Delaisse et al., 1991), arthritis (Mort et al., 1984), tumor invasion and metastasis (Sloane et al., 1994). Cathepsin B is very abundant and the most thoroughly studied lysosomal cysteine protease. It is the only papain-like cysteine protease exhibiting carboxydipeptidase activity (Aronson & Barrett, 1978; Bond & Barrett, 1980; Takahashi et al., 1986) as a result of the incorporation of a large, approximately 20 residue long insertion (occluding loop) into the sequence. The role of the loop as the anchor for a carboxyl group of a peptide substrate (or inhibitor) was inferred from the crystal structure of human cathepsin B (Musil et al., 1991) and con®rmed in its complex with a speci®c cathepsin B inhibitor (D. Turk et al., 1995). A mutant cathepsin

775 including hydrogen-bonding patterns, positioning of the side-chains and solvent molecules. Since we submitted our ®rst structures of human procathepsin B, the structures of three other cysteine protease proenzymes have been published, rat procathepsin B (Cygler et al., 1996), human procathepsin L (Coulombe et al., 1996) and papaya procaricain (Groves et al., 1996). However, the structure of human procathepsin B presented here reveals the active site residues (Cys29-His199 catalytic pair) at a suf®ciently high resolution to allow the description of the active site of a cysteine protease zymogen in atomic detail.

B lacking the occluding loop additionally showed that the loop is essential for the exopeptidase activity (Illy et al., 1997). Procathepsin B is synthesized in vivo as a 322 residue protein (Chan et al., 1986). While the mechanism of processing in vivo is still not clear, in vitro experiments have shown that it is possible to cleave the propeptide chain with various proteases. Pepsin and papain (Rowan et al., 1992; Mach et al., 1992), extracellular neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (Dalet-Fumeron et al., 1993) and lysosomal cathepsins B, D, L (Rowan et al., 1992) can all process procathepsin B. In all these cases the processed active enzyme contains an additional few residues at the N terminus (Rowan et al., 1992; Mach et al., 1994b; Kuhelj et al., 1995). It was shown (Rowan et al., 1992) that the combined use of cathepsin B and lysosomal aminodipeptidase cathepsin C (dipeptidylpeptidase I) results in the natural N terminus of cathepsin B. The ®nding that cathepsin B with a short N-terminal extension is present in culture media of human breast tumor obtained from explants and from purulent sputum (Mach et al., 1994a) suggests that trimming of cathepsin B to its mature N terminus is con®ned to lysosomes. At low pH, procathepsin B is capable of autocatalytic processing (Rowan et al., 1992; Mach et al., 1993, 1994b), the optimal pH being about 4.5 (Mach et al., 1994b). The autocleavage site is in the C-terminal part of the proregion between MetP56 and PheP57, and it was proposed that the autoactivation and autoprocessing of cathepsin B are intramolecular events (Mach et al., 1994b). The structures of human procathepsin B based on orthorhombic and hexagonal crystal forms difÊ Ê fracting to 3.2 A and 3.3 A, respectively, that were brie¯y described previously (Turk et al., 1996), as Ê well as that of rat procathepsin B to 2.8 A resolution (Cygler et al., 1996), revealed the fold of the propeptide that shields the active site from the solvent and thereby inhibits the enzymatic activity of the proenzyme. The mature enzyme structure, including the two domains and the active site cleft, is already formed in procathepsin B, whereas the occluding loop region (residues 105 to 126), which in the mature form packs down onto the surface of the enzyme, is kept by part of the propeptide in a raised conformation. The propeptide chain begins on the top of the molecule and folds on the rightdomain surface into a small region, which ends above the active site. From there the peptide chain runs in the reversed direction to the substrate above the active site and then across the interdomain interface in a loose conformation until the ®rst residue of the mature enzyme (Turk et al., 1996). The structure of procathepsin B has now been reÊ ®ned at 2.5 A resolution exploiting approximately double the amount of diffraction data compared to our previous structures. The lower-resolution models are con®rmed but it is now possible to describe the structure of procathepsin B in detail,

Results
Overall structure The crystal structure of human procathepsin B consists of the propeptide residues (ArgP1 to LysP62) and enzyme residues (Leu1 to Asp254) using the nomenclature proposed by Musil et al. (1991). An additional residue, MetP1A, was included at the proenzyme N terminus for technical Ê reasons. Comparison of the 2.5 A resolution hexaÊ gonal form structure with the 3.3 A resolution hexÊ agonal and 3.2 A resolution orthorhombic form structures presented by Turk et al. (1996) con®rms the basic correctness of the two structures with some obvious local differences, particularly in the linker part of the propeptide and in the occluding loop regions. The proenzyme chain is well de®ned by the electron density maps (Figure 1). The parts that are not well de®ned by the electron density are the ®rst N-terminal propeptide residues (MetP1A to HisP7), the two residues in the propeptide linker region (ThrP58 and GluP59), Asn47, the occluding loop residues Glu109 to Ser115, the two C-terminal residues and a few side-chains. The model of procathepsin B derived on the basis Ê of 2.5 A resolution data set includes 115 water molecules. The unit cells of the two hexagonal form crystals Ê Ê are slightly different (a  b  78.75 A, c  153.64 A Ê Ê Ê and a  b  77.55 A, c  153.16 A, for 3.3 A and Ê 2.5 A resolution structures, respectively). The slight differences between the two crystals arises from slightly different orientations of procathepsin B molecules. A root-mean-square (RMS) ®t calculation shows that the two hexagonal structures are rotated 3.3 relative to each other. The RMS distances of structurally equivalent CA atoms of cathepsin B in both hexagonal structures before Ê optimization was found to be 1.13 A with a maxiÊ (for 224 equivalent CA mum greater than 2.0 A atoms), while after the ®t the values decreased to Ê Ê 0.37 A and 0.75 A (for 273 equivalent CA atoms), Ê respectively. A comparison of the 2.5 A resolution hexagonal structure with the orthorhombic crystal form of the procathepsin B structure and the mature cathepsin B structure (Musil et al., 1991) after optimizing the structurally equivalent CA atoms Ê Ê yields values of 0.46 A (with maximum 1.11 A, for

Ê 275 equivalent CA atoms) and 0.40 A (with maxiÊ mum 1.07 A, for 232 equivalent CA atoms), respectively. These values are a good estimate of coordinate error. The propeptide chain wraps around the enzymatic domains in a C-shape fold, forming almost a complete circle (Figure 2). The disordered N-terminal part of the propeptide starts somewhere on the top of the molecule. The chain runs into a small region with de®ned secondary structure elements and continues as a loosely packed linker peptide towards the cathepsin B N terminus (Leu1; Figure 3). The linker peptide runs in an extended conformation across the active site cleft in the direction opposite to bound substrate and continues in multiple turns further along the interdomain interface. The access of a substrate molecule to the active site is thereby prevented (Figure 4). The propeptide structure The small propeptide folded region is composed of two structural motifs (a three-turn a- helix/antiparallel b-strand and a two-turn a-helix) connected by a short, kinked intermediate region. The a-b structural motif consists of a three-turn a-helix (AspP11 to AsnP21) and an extended b-strand (ThrP23 to HisP28) running antiparallel to it. The helix dipole is stabilized by two negatively charged residues (AspP11 and GluP12) at its N-terminal end and by two positively charged residues (LysP19 and ArgP20) at its C-terminal end. The motif's hydrophilic side faces the solvent, while its hydrophobic side-chains (AlaP26, TrpP24, ValP17, ValP14 and LeuP13) as well as LeuP9, merge into a substantial hydrophobic core on the top of the

enzyme's right domain. The antiparallel arrangement of the helix and b-strand is internally stabilized by two hydrogen bonds: the imidazole ring of HisP28 is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen atom of LeuP9 and the AsnP18 side-chain is hydrogen-bonded to both the carbonyl oxygen and the amide hydrogen atoms of AlaP26 (Figure 5). The kinked region is formed by a six-residue connection (AsnP29 to AspP34). The general conformation of this region is essentially the same in all three human procathepsin B structures. It is a bstrand-like structure with a wide kink in the middle, where the polarity of the peptide bonds reverses. The chain continues from the six-residue connection down to the catalytic residues as a two-turn a-helix, which tightens at the bottom into a 310 helical hydrogen-bonding pattern (CysP42). It is a typical amphipathic helix with its hydrophobic side (MetP35, LeuP38 and LeuP41) turned against the hydrophobic core on top of the structure. The latter is formed by the residues of the right domain and those of the proenzyme a-b structural motif (Figure 5). Structure of the enzymatic domains The two domains (referred as the R and L domains according to their right and left position in the standard view, respectively, shown in Figure 2) constitute the mature enzyme. They interact through an extended polar interface. The two active site residues Cys29 and His199 are located at the bottom of a V-shaped interdomain cleft. The structure of the two enzymatic domains in the proenzyme is virtually identical with their structure in the mature form (Musil et al., 1991; and see Figure 3). The structure of the substrate-binding sites from S2 to S2H is already formed, including the catalytic thiolate-imidazolium ion pair (Figures 1 and 2).

The distance between Cys29 SG and His199 ND1 Ê atom is about 3.2 A. The mature enzyme has a chain break between Asn47 and Val50. In procathepsin B residues 48 and 49 form part of a broad loop. In the hexagonal form crystals these region lies close to a symmetry 2-fold axis with Asn47 only weakly de®ned by electron density. In the orthorhombic form structure, the electron density map allowed us to position these residues unambiguously. The occluding loop structures The major and striking difference between the proenzyme and the mature enzyme structure is the positioning of the occluding loop (residues Ile105 to Pro126). In the proenzyme structure the loop is lifted by the propeptide above the enzyme surface, whereas in the mature form it is tightly packed onto the enzyme surface (Figure 6), forming a broad loop with the two histidine residues His110 and His111 providing a positively charged anchor for a substrate carboxylic group. The part of the loop that shows the major conformational change comprises the residues between Cys108 and Cys119. The positioning of the loop residues is different among all three crystal forms' structures (Figure 6). In the orthorhombic form the loop residues are Ê well de®ned, whereas the 3.3 A resolution hexagonal form lacks electron density for residues beÊ tween Asn113 and Ser115, and the 2.5 A resolution hexagonal form structure lacks density for almost the whole loop between the two cysteine residues (108 and 119), which are connected by a disul®de bond. The density in the occluding loop region of Ê the 2.5 A structure is far from being randomly scattered (Figure 7), raising the possibility of a limited number of conformations of the loop in this crystal form. The close packing of the equivalent parts of the symmetry-related molecules in the hexagonal

Interactions between the propeptide and mature enzyme domains The interface between the propeptide and mature enzyme domains contains no disul®de bridge (Mach et al., 1994a,b). The interface exhibits hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic character. Only a few

781 ment. The helix C-terminal LeuP41 carbonyl group points towards the hydrogen bond donor environment formed by the side-chains of His199 and Gln23. The propeptide residues do not distort the Cys29-His199 pair nor do any of them enter the oxyanion hole formed by the Cys29 main-chain and Gln23 side-chain amide groups. The hydrophobic side-chains of the helix (residues LeuP38, and LeuP41) point into the active site cleft (Figure 1). They, together with the hydrophobic residues of the kink region (PheP30 and ValP33), sit on the top of the hydrophobic S1H (Leu181, Leu182, Met196 and Trp221) and S2H (Trp221, Trp225 and Phe180) binding sites. The side-chains of TyrP37 and ArgP40 are located beneath the occluding loop residues Cys119 and Glu122, thus raising the occluding loop away from the enzyme surface. TyrP37 is squeezed between the occluding loop disul®de bridge 108-119 and the body of the enzyme. The side-chains of ArgP40 and LysP39 are in electrostatically favorable environments, although they are not involved in salt-bridge formation. The guanidinium group of ArgP40 is placed above the disul®de bond 26-71 and spans between the Ser25 carbonyl group and the side-chain of Asn72. The amino group of LysP39 is located close to the negative charge of the Glu194 side-chain and it approaches the negative environment of Asp69 from a symmetryrelated molecule. The position of the two-turn helix inside the active site cleft suggests an additional stabilization of the structure. The tandem arrangement of the two-turn helix and the central helix means that their dipoles stabilize each other electrostatically. (The central helix is the longest helix, starting at the active site Cys29 and running down to the bottom of the L-domain (Figures 2 and 3)). As the propeptide chain exits the two-turn helix (residues LeuP41, CysP42, GlyP43 and ThrP44) it runs across the substrate-binding sites (S1, S2) in the direction opposite to a bound substrate (Figure 4). The carbonyl group of LeuP41 points in the direction of Gln23 NE2 and the side-chain of His199 forming two hydrogen bonds (Figure 5). Figure 4 clearly shows that carbonyl groups of LeuP41 and GlyP43 superimpose with the carbonyl groups of the modeled P2H and P1 substrate residues, furthermore the CA-C bond of LeuP41 superimposes with the N-C bond connecting P2H and P1H substrate atoms, and the CA-CB bond of ThrP44 superimposes with the CA-CB bond of a P2 residue. The LeuP41 side-chain orientation similar to that of the carboxylic group of an P2H residue and the CysP42 side-chain binds into the S1H binding pocket. The small residue GlyP43 is positioned close to the S1 binding site with È,É angles (À106 ,44 ) somewhere between the helix and b-strand. The ThrP44 side-chain is pointing into the S2 binding site. Figure 4 shows that the orientation of the carbonyl group and the amide proton from the CysP42GlyP43 peptide bond is opposite the orientation of

main-chain:main-chain interactions are observed in the interface. Side-chain interactions prevail, but no salt bridge is formed (Figure 5). Several cavities in the interface are ®lled with solvent molecules mediating hydrophilic interactions between the propeptide and the enzyme domains. The total Connolly surface of procathepsin B in Ê the 2.5 A resolution structure is approximately Ê 14,000 A2, of which the enzyme moiety accounts Ê Ê for 10,200 A2 and the propeptide part 3800 A2. The surface of the enzyme domains by themselves is Ê 11,540 A2 and the surface of the propeptide by itÊ self is 5020 A2. The interaction surface between the Ê two is thus approximately 1300 A2, which is about 10% of the surface of the enzyme domains and about 25% of the propeptide surface. The propepÊ tide covers 550 A2 of the surface of the Phe174 to Ê His199 loop, of which 250 A2 are accounted for the by hydrophobic part of the surface. The a-b structural motif sits on the top of the Rdomain. The contact area on the latter is formed by the residues between Phe174 and His199, coming out of the R-domain b-barrel. Part of the short extended propeptide b structure (ThrP23-HisP28) runs in an antiparallel b-strand arrangement along the loop residues Lys184 and Val187. The indole ring of the only tryptophan residue in the propeptide sequence (TrpP24) anchors the bottom of the hydrophobic surface of the motif in the middle of the R-domain hydrophobic loop (Figures 3 and 5). The surface of the upper layer of the a-b structural motif, which is exposed to solvent, is hydrophilic (AspP11, GluP12, AsnP15, TyrP16, LysP19, AsnP21 and GlnP25). The TrpP24 ring is embedded in a layer of enzyme hydrophobic side-chains (Leu182, Val191) on top of which a layer of propeptide hydrophobic residues (LeuP13, ValP14, ValP17, ArgP20 and AlaP26) is packed. The TrpP24 NE1 atom forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of Gln189 and its rings are packed almost perpendicular to the Tyr188 aromatic ring lying underneath. In this way the indol closes the cluster of aromatic residues (Tyr183, Trp225, Phe231, Phe174 and Phe180) comprising the middle of the R-domain b-barrel. The residues of the kinked region AsnP32 to AspP34 are placed against occluding loop residues Cys119 and Thr120 in a parallel b-packing arrangement. The amide nitrogen atom of AspP34 is hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen atom of Cys119. Other interactions between the kinked region and the occluding loop are not resolved in the Ê 2.5 A resolution model because we could not unambiguously trace the residues between Glu109 and Asn115 through the electron density. In the orthorhombic form however, the occluding loop residues (His110 to Thr120) form a wall that interacts with the structure of the kink with several interdigitating hydrogen-bond connections. The two-turn a-helix is located in the middle of the V shaped active site cleft. All helix side-chains are well anchored into the corresponding hydropathic character of the R and L-domain environ-

782 the equipositioned bond of the bound substrate model. The carbonyl group does not point into the oxyanion hole but into the solvent on the opposite side, where it links into the hydrogen-bond network of a well-de®ned cluster of solvent molecules (Figure 1). The GlyP43 amide proton is involved in a hydrogen bond with the active site negatively charged side-chain of CysP29 (the N-SG distance is Ê about 3.2 A). The GlyP43 carbonyl group is stabilized by a hyÊ drogen bond to the amide proton of Gly74 (3.2 A) as usually described for the substrate analogue inhibitors (Drenth et al., 1976) and reverse binding inhibitors (Varughese et al., 1992). However, the aromatic ring of Trp30 (26 in papain nomenclature), whose ring lies in the plane of the peptide Ê bond and whose CD1 atom is only 3.0 A away from the carbonyl group, is also a possible hydrogen bond donor. The tryptophan residue at this position is a conserved residue throughout the family. We think that its relevance in binding of substrate and reverse binding inhibitors has probably not been noticed, because aromatic rings are usually not considered as hydrogen-bond donors or acceptors. ThrP44 and PheP45 are ®xed to the bottom of the active site cleft between the R and L-domains by forming hydrogen bonds to Gly198 and Gly74, respectively (Figure 5). The side-chains of ThrP44 and LeuP46 are arranged around the S2 binding site, but do not enter it. The ThrP44 OG1 atom is stabilized between the negatively charged SG atom of Cys29 and the amide proton of Ala200. The ThrP44 hydroxyl group obviously signi®cantly contributes to the tightness of propeptide interaction with the active site. Several solvent molecules were located above the propeptide residues running across the active site cleft (Figure 5), an additional indication that these two propeptide residues sit tight in the active site cleft. The chain from LeuP46 to LysP50 wraps around Glu245. The amide nitrogen atom of GlyP47 is oriented towards the carboxyl group of Glu245, which is the only charged group on the cathepsin B surface in direct contact with a residue of the propeptide. One would expect that the LysP50 side-chain to be involved in a salt bridge formation with the nearby Glu245, but it points into the solvent, away from the Glu245 side-chain. The relatively large volume between the propeptide and enzyme surface around the Glu245, including the S2 binding site, is occupied by several solvent molecules, which ®ll the cavity (Figure 5). The general location of the backbone chain of the linker peptide from GlyP47 to LysP62 is similar in the three models of human procathepsin B, but they differ in the positions of the side-chains. The Ê peptide region from ProP52 to LeuP61 in the 2.5 A resolution structure is shifted almost one amino acid residue towards the N terminus in comparison with the other two structures (Turk et al., 1996). Re®nement enforcing similarity among the various crystal forms using non-crystallographic

similarity constraints only raised the crystallographic R-value, so we concluded that the differences among the structures from the three crystal forms are real. They appear to be a consequence of different crystal packing arrangements. Residues ThrP58 and GluP59 are poorly resolved in the electron density. The chain in this region is slightly lifted from the enzyme surface. It starts in a b-strand conformation (GlnP53 to ThrP58: Figure 5) that continues as a broad helical turn (GluP59 to LeuP61), with hydrophobic residues (PheP57 and LeuP61) facing the enzyme surface and, together with residues Leu1 and Ala162, form a small hydrophobic cluster. Kinetic measurements The values of the kinetic and equilibrium constants obtained for the inhibition of the two forms of cathepsin B by chicken cystatin are: kass  3.15 (Æ0.21) Â 106 MÀ1sÀ1, kdiss  2.22(Æ0.05) Â 10À3sÀ1, Ki  0.71(Æ0.06) nM for the wild-type and kass  6.20 (Æ0.42) Â 106 MÀ1sÀ1, kdiss  0.44(Æ0.02) Â 10À3sÀ1, Ki  0.07(Æ0.01) nM for the Asp224Asn mutant form.

Discussion
Comparison with other related proenzyme structures The structures of procathepsin L (Coulombe et al., 1996) and procaricain (Groves et al., 1996) show a mode of propeptide binding to their enzyme domains similar to that observed in the procathepsin B structures (Cygler et al., 1996; Turk et al., 1996). With its shorter propeptide and longer enzyme region, cathepsin B is a member of a different subfamily of the papain superfamily from cathepsin L and caricain (Karrer et al., 1993; Berti & Storer, 1995). The interactions that stabilize the propeptide structure in procathepsin B appear to be those with the occluding loop and other, tighter interactions with the underlying enzyme surface (for example the TrpP24 side-chain), whereas in the cathepsin L subfamily the part of the propeptide that is structurally equivalent to cathepsin B interacts strongly with the additional residues (relative to cathepsin B propeptide) on the propeptide N terminus (Coulombe et al., 1996; Groves et al., 1996). Comparison of the active site structures of human procathepsin B and of rat procathepsin B with active Cys29 mutated to Ser (Cygler et al., 1996), with human procathepsin L with the same Ser replacement (Coulombe et al., 1996) has shown a difference in orientation of the peptide bond placed above the active site between the procathepsins B and L. In procathepsin B the CysP42-GlyP43 peptide bond oxygen atom points away from the active site (Figure 4) and the amide nitrogen atom makes a hydrogen bond with the Cys29 SG atom. In cathepsin L the equivalent peptide bond carbonyl group points in the direction of the oxyanion

783 ture and proenzyme forms, presuming that the propeptide assumes the same structure upon binding to the enzyme as within the procathepsin B. This further suggests that cysteine protease inhibitors of the cystatin superfamily also displace the occluding loop from its position in the active site cleft, on binding to cathepsin B. A crystallographic study of the cathepsin B-cystatin C complex supports this suggestion (C. Huber, personal communication). The occluding loop displacement can thus account for the several orders of magnitude higher inhibition constants for cathepsin B when compared to papain (Machleidt et al., 1991; Hall ÏÏ È et al., 1993; Lenarcic et al., 1993; Bjork et al., 1994; Pol et al., 1995). To verify the role of the ¯exibility of the occluding loop when binding to inhibitors, a mutant Asp224Asn was constructed, weakening electrostatic interaction between the enzyme body and the occluding loop residue Arg116. The kinetic measurements showed that the inhibition constant for the interaction with chicken cystatin was decreased about tenfold, con®rming the hypothesis. Maturation of the enzyme The processing of procathepsin B into the mature active enzyme has been well studied (Rowan et al., 1992; Mach et al., 1992, 1993, 1994a,b). Procathepsin B can be cleaved in vitro by different intracellular and extracellular proteases and via an autocatalytic mechanism under acidic conditions. The cleavage of the non-autoactivatable mutant of procathepsin B (Cys29Ser) by cathepsin B shows that processing can be intermolecular (Rowan et al., 1992; Mach et al., 1994b). Mach et al. (1994b) showed that both activation and proteolytic cleavage of human procathepsin B are concentration-independent reactions, suggesting that maturation of the enzyme is an intramolecular process. However, knowing the three-dimensional structure of the proenzyme, intramolecular cleavage does not seem to be possible, because the propeptide lies in the active site cleft in a reverse direction to that of a substrate. In addition, only one cleavage site (the bond between MetP56 and PheP57; Figure 3) was found (Mach et al., 1994b). In order to be cleaved, a peptide bond should present its carbonyl group in the proper orientation. The carbonyl group of the CysP42-GlyP43 peptide bond (which could be a potential S1H -S1 scissile bond) is pointing away from the Cys29 nucleophilic side-chain and from the oxyanion hole (Figure 4), which is needed for the stabilization of a tetrahedral intermediate in a common substrate cleavage. The nearest carbonyl atom in the proenzyme that could be attacked by Ê Cys29 is that from GlyP43 (SG-C distance 3.5 A), which in the structure again points away from the oxyanion hole. The closest carbonyl group pointing in the direction of the oxyanion hole is that from LeuP41, but this is still too far away to be reached Ê by Cys29 (SG-C distance 4.8 A), which makes the cleavage of the CysP42-LeuP41 peptide bond highly unlikely.

hole, forming hydrogen bonds to the side-chain of Gln19 (equivalent to Gln23 in procathepsin B), to the Ser25 (mutated active Cys25) amide nitrogen atom and to its OG atom. It appears that the Ser mutant (Cygler et al., 1996), although abolishing the negative charge of the SG atom, does not affect the binding geometry of the propeptide in procathepsin B. The structures reveal some other differences between the cathepsins. The cathepsin B propeptide appears to exhibit tighter interactions with the active site cleft than the cathepsin L propeptide, because the hydrophilic side-chain of the procathepsin B ThrP44 residue forms an additional hydrogen bond with the active site residue Cys29 (Figure 5), which the hydrophobic side-chain of the equivalent procathepsin L residue, Leu78p, is not capable of forming. The effect of the propeptide structure on the stability of the proenzyme In contrast to mature cathepsin B (Turk et al., 1994) procathepsin B is stable in neutral and slightly basic pH as seen from the folding conditions of the unfolded proenzyme chain (Mach et al, 1994a,b; Kuhelj et al., 1995). The extended pH stability range of procathepsin B appears to be a consequence of several structural features. The propeptide shields large portions of the enzyme's hydrophobic surface behind the S1H substrate-binding site from solvent and exposes its own hydrophilic surface. It also binds into the active site cleft forming tight interactions with residues of the Rdomain and L-domain polar interface (Figures 1, 2 and 5). Flexibility of part of the occluding loop is important for inhibitor binding It has already been shown that the loop is involved in interactions with the propeptide (Cygler et al., 1996; Turk et al., 1996). The availability of the third human procathepsin B structure enables us to suggest which parts of the loop are more important for the zymogen structure formation as cathepsin B must somehow compensate for the shorter propeptide chain and its smaller structural motifs when compared with other cysteine protease propeptides. Figure 6 reveals that particularly the occluding loop region between the disul®de bridge (Cys108 and Cys119) exhibits large structural differences, whereas the residues between Cys119 and Thr125 appear to be much more ®xed. They build a rim of the active site cleft and are positioned in the proenzyme structures only slightly higher than in the native cathepsin B structure. The presence and the accommodation of the propeptide in the active site cleft (from ArgP40 to PheP45) is the obvious reason for this higher positioning. Inhibition of cathepsin B by its propeptide (Fox et al., 1992) indicates that the occluding loop can reversibly exchange its conformation between ma-

784 Intramolecular cleavage of the MetP56-PheP57 (Figure 3) scissile bond also seems highly unlikely. In procathepsin B this site is not accessible to the active site of the same molecule. A complex scenario would be required to bring the scissile bond into a productive substrate-binding orientation in the active site. It would involve complete separation of the propeptide from the enzyme domains and movement of several enzyme N-terminal residues that would have to wrap around the two enzyme domains across the opposite side as observed in the proenzyme structure. A simple modeling study has shown that at least the residues preceding Asp6 should be moved, assuming that the occluding loop residues stay in the position observed in the proenzyme structure, thereby not blocking access to the active site cleft from the back. After processing, the N-terminal residues should return to the positions observed in the structure of mature cathepsin B (Musil et al., 1991), which are the same as in the proenzyme. On the other hand, the structure of the cleavage site ful®ls the generally accepted criteria for accessibility and ¯exibility of a peptide bond susceptible to intermolecular cleavage. It is exposed to solvent and quite loosely packed, so that an exposed active site from another molecule can approach and hydrolyze the peptide bond. We conclude therefore that proteolytic maturation must be an intermolecular process. Autoactivation of procathepsin B at low pH implies that the change of ionization state of certain proton acceptor group(s) triggers separation of the propeptide from the enzymatic domains. The interface of the enzyme and propeptide does not include any such group. The only carboxyl group that is involved in interactions between the propeptide and enzyme structure is Glu245, which stabilizes attachment of the propeptide linker region to the enzyme surface. It seems very unlikely that neutralization of the Glu245 negative charge could be enough to repel the already quite loosely attached linker peptide strongly enough to trigger propeptide removal from the active site. The synthetic propeptide of cathepsin B is a tight-binding inhibitor with Ki 0.4 nM at pH 6.0, but is a weak inhibitor at pH 4.0 when it is slowly degraded by the enzyme (Fox et al., 1992). This indicates that the activity of the enzyme is much less affected than the inhibitory properties of the propeptide when pH is lowered. As the interaction surface between the enzyme and its propeptide does not include any possible pH-dependent triggers, they should be looked for within the propeptide itself. Thus we assume that in acidic pH the propeptide three-dimensional structure gets disrupted. The human propeptide contains ®ve acidic residues (AspP11, GluP12, AspP34, GluP59 and AspP60). The last two (GluP59 and AspP60) are loosely de®ned in the part of the chain without any ordered secondary structure and show no interaction with the rest of the molecule, and are

thus probably not involved in pH-dependent structural rearrangement. However, the other three acidic side-chains are placed at the N termini of the two helices in the propeptide structure, thereby additionally stabilizing their dipoles. We suggest that in procathepsin B a moderate change in pH affecting the propeptide acidic residues exposed to the surface destabilizes the propeptide secondary structure and invokes autoactivation of the enzyme. The loss of the propeptide structure leads to distortion of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interaction with the mature part. This results in a propeptide dissociation from the enzyme surface, leading to intermolecular proteolytic cleavage and release of active mature cathepsin B molecules. A similar two-step mechanism was proposed for the in vitro autoactivation of procaricain by Groves et al. (1996). A low pH may be essential for activation of procathepsin B in vivo, and processing could be the beginning of the enzyme degradation, disabling its return into its zymogen form. It is however clear that more work is required to understand the in vivo activation pathways of cathepsin B and other related enzymes.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization and X-ray data collection Recombinant human procathepsin B was prepared as described (Kuhelj et al., 1995). The protein was stored in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at a concentration of about 10 mg/ml. Crystals were grown at 22 C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method against 2 M ammonium sulfate (pH 5.7). Droplets were formed by mixing 3 ml of protein solution with 3 ml of the reservoir solution. The crystals were obtained from the amorphous precipitate after two weeks. Diffraction data beyond Ê 2.5 A resolution were collected on 18 cm MAR image plate detector system using a Rigaku rotation anode with copper radiation as the X-ray source. During the data collection process the crystal was rotated for 92.5 with 0.5 increments. The measurement was done at 15 C. The diffraction data were processed, scaled, merged and reduced using the HKL program suite (Otwinowski, 1993; Minor, 1993). The crystallographic data and their statistics are shown in Table 1. Structure determination In spite of evidently similar cell constants, the model Ê of procathepsin B determined at 3.3 A resolution (Turk et al., 1996) did not ®t exactly into the new electron density, which was calculated from the model and the new jFobsj. As a consequence of this, the new orientation and position of the procathepsin B molecule were found using the AMoRe suite of programs (Navaza, 1994; Ê CCP4, 1994). The model of procathepsin B at 3.3 A resolution was used as the search model. The rotation and translation functions were computed using data between Ê Ê 15 A and 3.5 A resolution. The best R-factor value that was obtained was 0.356. The computer program MAIN (Turk, 1992) was used interactively for electron density map calculations, model building and analysis, electron density averaging and crystallographic structure re®ne-

ment, using Engh & Huber (1991) force-®eld parameters. The structure re®nement included the conventional energy restrained re®nement procedures of positional Ê parameters. The positional re®nement started at 3.3 A resolution with temperature factors of all atoms set to Ê 22 A2. The shape of the j2jFobsj À jFcalcjj electron density map showed some differences from the starting model. Resolution of the data was gradually expanded to Ê 2.5 A, and the combination of crystallographic re®nement and model building improved the electron density and brought the R-factor to 0.25. Individual B-factor re®nement was applied using bond and angle restraints. The minimum allowed temperature factor was set to Ê Ê 5 A2 and the maximum one to 80 A2. The mean values

and RMS standard deviations of temperature factors are shown in Figure 8. In all, 115 water molecules were progressively added using the MAIN automatic procedure and by manual inspection of the electron density map. When the R-factor dropped below 0.20 the ``kicked'' omit maps were used for re®ning the coordinates of the amino acid residues with ambiguous position. Kicked omit maps were calculated from randomly displaced atoms by omitting the region of interest from the structure factor calculation. The R-free value was calculated by omitting one twelfth of the re¯ections from the re®nement. The atom coordinates were ®rst randomly disÊ Ê placed by 0.25 A and B-values by 6 A2. The positional and B-factor re®nement was then calculated using the re-

¯ections without the members of the selected subgroup. After a positional and B-value re®nement procedure, the R-free value dropped to 0.23. The quality of the procathepsin B model was frequently inspected during the model building and re®nement sessions for deviations from geometry, density and B-value restraints. Inspections were based on searches for local spots of high energy, correlation of model with electron density maps, Ramachandran plot, searches for hydrogen-bonding patterns and crystal packing. At the end of re®nement a lot of hints for structure corrections came from kicked omit maps and from RMS deviations from the average B-values of residues along the chain. The crystallographic R-factor value of the ®nal model is 0.18. The results of the re®nement and analysis of the ®nal model are shown in Table 1. The RMS deviations of bond distances and bond angles were calculated using MAIN. All residues except the propeptide residue AsnP32 lie in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, the vast majority lying in the most favorable regions. AsnP32 is only poorly de®ned by the electron density maps, which prevented de®nition of its precise conformation. For this reason, subsequent re®nement could not result in a good stereo-chemistry for the residue. For the calculations of pairs for RMS ®t between the equivalent CA atoms, only the cathepsin B part, excluding the occluding loop region (residues 108 to 124) and a dipeptide 47-48, was used. The crystal packing of the procathepsin B molecule shows no bad contact between the symmetry-related molecules. All calculations and model building were performed on Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 (Irix 5.3) and Alpha (Digital Unix 4.0) workstations. Site-directed mutagenesis Mutagenesis was performed by the method of Michael (1994). The oligonucleotide used for the mutagenesis was as follows (the altered base is underlined): Asp224Asn replacement: 5H -GAACACTAACTGGGGT-3H . After refolding, the wild-type and the mutant forms of procathepsin B were activated as described (Kuhelj et al., 1995), to give rise to enzymatically active proteins. Kinetic measurements The kinetics of interaction of chicken cystatin and with cathepsin B and its Asp224Asn mutant were analyzed at 25 C as described (B. Turk et al.,1993, 1995). All the experiments were performed under pseudo-®rst-order conditions with at least tenfold molar excess of inhibitor, using 10 mM Z-Arg-Arg-AMC as the substrate. No correction for substrate concentration was needed, as the substrate concentration used was substantially lower than the Km values for both enzymes (245(Æ63) mM for the wild type, 291(Æ42) mM for the Asp224Asn mutant, determined in separate experiments).
