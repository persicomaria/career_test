Nucleolin is an abundant 70 kDa nucleolar protein involved in many aspects of ribosomal RNA biogenesis. The central region of nucleolin contains four tandem consensus RNA-binding domains (RBD). The two most N-terminal domains (RBD12) bind with nanomolar af®nity to an RNA stem-loop containing the consensus sequence UCCCGA in the loop. We have determined the solution structure of nucleolin RBD12 in its free form and have studied its interaction with a 22 nt RNA stem-loop using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. The two RBDs adopt the expected babbab fold, but the position of the b2 strand in both domains differs from what was predicted from sequence alignments. RBD1 and RBD2 are signi®cantly different from each others and this is likely important in their sequence speci®c recognition of the RNA. RBD1 has a longer a-helix 1 and a shorter b2-b3 loop than RBD2, and differs from most other RBDs in these respects. The two RBDs are separated by a 12 amino acid ¯exible linker and do not interact with one another in the free protein. This linker becomes ordered when RBD12 binds to the RNA. Analysis of the observed NOEs between the protein and the RNA indicates that both RBDs interact with the RNA loop via their b-sheet. Each domain binds residues on one side of the loop; speci®cally, RBD2 contacts the 5H side and RBD1 contacts the 3H .

Introduction
Nucleolin is a multidomain multifunctional protein of $70 kDa which comprises about 10 % of the nucleolar proteins. In spite of its ubiquitous presence in the nucleolus, the functional roles of nucleolin (as well as the other major non-ribosomal nucleolar proteins ®brillarin and B23) in ribosome biogenesis are only beginning to be elucidated

(Ginisty et al., 1999; Srivastava & Pollard, 1999). Nucleolin has been implicated in the regulation of nucleolar structure and RNA polymerase I transcription (i.e. rDNA), pre-rRNA processing, and nucleolar targeting of some ribosomal proteins. The domain structure of nucleolin is illustrated in Figure 1(a). The N-terminal domain contains repeated TPXKK motifs ¯anked by stretches of acidic amino acid residues. This domain is extensively phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase during mitosis and casein kinase (CKII) in interphase (Belenguer et al., 1989, 1990; Peter et al., 1990). The central region of the protein contains four consensus RNA-binding domains (RBD), also known as the RNA recognition motif (RRM). The C-terminal domain is an RGG domain, also called a GAR domain, which is characterized by an abundance of glycine, arginine, and phenylalanine residues. The RGG domain of nucleolin also binds RNA, but the binding is non-speci®c and weak (Ghisol® et al., 1992a,b).

Nucleolin associates tightly with pre-rRNA (Kd 50-100 nM ). This association appears to take place on the nascent transcript and to persist throughout transcription (Ghisol®-Nieto et al., 1996; Herrera & Olson, 1986). Initial mapping of nucleolin interactions with the 5H ETS (external transcribed spacer) of various species revealed a conserved UCCCGA binding motif. The sequence speci®c binding of nucleolin to sites on the pre-rRNA was further characterized by in vitro selection (SELEX) (Ellington & Szostak, 1990; Irvine et al., 1991)

experiments (Ghisol®-Nieto et al., 1996). These studies identi®ed the 18 nucleotide consensus motif, 5H -CCGAAA(U/G)CCCGAAGUAGG. The sequence can form a stem-loop secondary structure, and further experiments con®rmed that a stem-loop structure with a conserved UCCCGA motif in the loop is required for nucleolin binding (Figure 1(b)) (Ghisol®-Nieto et al., 1996; Serin et al., 1996). This nucleolin recognition element (NRE) has been found in 11 sites on the human rRNA 5H ETS as well as 4, 2, 4, 9, and 3 sites on the 18 S,

229 individual domains. While both RBDs adopt the expected babbab topology, they are signi®cantly different from one another. In RBD12, the two domains have the same structure as in the individual domains and are separated by a ¯exible linker. This ¯exible linker becomes ordered when the protein is bound to the 22 nt sNRE (selex NRE) RNA. Both the tertiary structure of the RBDs and therefore some of their predicted interactions with the RNA differ from a model structure based on biochemical data and genetic studies (Bouvet et al., 1997). Analysis of the interactions between RBD12 and the RNA reveals that the surface of the b-sheet of RBD2 and RBD1 contact the 5H and 3H sides of the loop, respectively.

ITS1 (internal transcribed spacer), ITS2, 28S, and 3H ETS, respectively (Serin et al., 1996). Similar sites are found in the mouse pre-RNA. Nucleolin appears to interact in vivo all along the pre-rRNA. It has been suggested that these interactions may play a role in transcriptional regulation of rRNA as well as in rRNA processing (Ginisty et al., 1998; Serin et al., 1996). The high af®nity sequence speci®c interaction of the NRE with nucleolin has been localized to the ®rst two nucleolin RNA-binding domains (RBDs) (RBD12) (Bouvet et al., 1997; Serin et al., 1997). Both RBDs are required for binding, and no interaction is found with RBD3 and RBD4. The RBD is an 8090 amino acid sequence which contains two highly conserved sequences, the RNP-1 octapeptide and the RNP-2 hexapeptide (Birney et al., 1993). This domain is found in a large number of different kinds of RNA-binding proteins involved in virtually all aspects of post-transcriptional gene regulation, i.e. pre-RNA splicing, poly(A) tail synthesis and maturation, translational control, mRNA stability and transport (Burd & Dreyfuss, 1994; Varani & Nagai, 1998). Structural analysis of RBDs from several different proteins has shown that the domain is characterized by a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet packed against two a-helices arranged in a babbab topology (Avis et al., 1996; Crowder et al., 1999; Garrett et al., 1994; Inoue et al., 1997, 2000; Ito et al., 1999; Lee et al., 1994; Lu & Hall, 1997; Nagai et al., 1990; Nagata et al., 1999a,b; Shamoo et al., 1997; Wittekind et al., 1992; Xu et al., 1997). Despite the ubiquitous occurrence of RBDs in proteins involved in RNA processing, the structures of only a very limited number of RBD protein-RNA complexes have been determined. These are U1A (Allain et al., 1996; Oubridge et al., 1994; Varani et al., 2000), U2BHH (Price et al., 1998), sexlethal (Handa et al., 1999), and the polyA binding protein (Deo et al., 1999). One RBD protein, hnRNPA1, has been solved in complex with singlestranded telomeric DNA (Ding et al., 1999). Like nucleolin, U1A and U2BHH bind speci®cally to an RNA stem-loop but only one RBD is necessary to achieve speci®city, whereas nucleolin requires two RBDs (Serin et al., 1997). Sex-lethal, hnRNPA1 and polyA binding protein need two RBDs to achieve speci®city but bind only single-stranded RNA (or DNA), whereas nucleolin binds a stem-loop. The mode of binding of nucleolin to RNA must have elements in common with the binding of the other RBDs, but it must also differ from them in a signi®cant way, since the two RBDs are required to bind a stem-loop RNA but do not bind singlestranded RNA. We have determined the solution structure of the two N-terminal RBDs of nucleolin, RBD12. This provides the ®rst structural information on this important protein and is the ®rst RBD structure determined for a protein involved in ribosomal RNA processing. We adopted a modular approach by ®rst determining the structure of the

Results and Discussion
Modular approach: structure determination of the individual domains of nucleolin RBD1 and RBD2 Since RBD12 is a fairly large protein to study by NMR spectroscopy, we adopted a modular approach of studying the two RBDs separately in order to facilitate spectral assignment and structure determination (Campbell & Downing, 1998). The protein constructs used are shown in Figure 1(c). RBD1 and RBD2 were overexpressed in unlabeled, uniformly 15N-labeled, and uniformly 15N, 13Clabeled forms for use in the NMR study. Spectra were recorded at 293 K, pH 6.2 in 100 mM KCl. Representative 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of RBD1 and RBD2 are shown in Figure 2(a) and (b). These spectra show the expected chemical shift dispersion and linewidths of well behaved, folded globular proteins. Almost complete 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments were obtained by analysis of a suite of standard triple-resonance experiments (Cavanagh et al., 1996). The only resonances not assigned are the amide resonance of Asn53 which is not observable at 293K due to line broadening and a few Lys Hd and He which overlap. 2D homonuclear nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) and 3D sensitivity enhanced gradient selected (PEP-PFG) 15N NOESY-HSQC (Cavanagh et al., 1996) and 13C-edited HSQC-NOESY (Majumdar & Zuiderweg, 1993) spectra were analyzed to obtain interproton distance restraints used to calculate the three-dimensional structures of RBD1 and RBD2. 1335 nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE)-derived distance constraints (including 425 long-range) were collected for RBD1 and 1209 NOE-derived distance constraints (including 356 long-range) were collected for RBD2 (Table 1), and used to calculate precise tertiary structures. Schematic representations of the observed interstrand NOEs which de®ne the bsheet of RBD1 and RBD2 are shown in Figure 2(c) and (d), respectively.

bone atoms) and RBD2 (34 structures, rmsd 0.81 Ê (/ À 0.35) A for the backbone atoms) are shown in Figure 3. Both RBD1 and RBD2 adopt the expected babbab fold of RBDs (Nagai et al., 1990) (Figures 3 and 4). Although they share a common fold, nucleolin RBD1 and RBD2 are signi®cantly different from one another. RBD1 has a longer a-helix 1 (by one turn) and a shorter b2-b3 loop (four amino acid residues instead of 8) than RBD2 (Figure 4). In addition, RBD2 has a short 310 helix at its N terminus (S93-A99) which points away from the domain (Figures 3 and 4(b)), whereas the N terminus of RBD1 is not helical (S10-T12) and interacts with the

b-sheet. The presence of the N-terminal helix and of the longer b2-b3 loop, both of which point away from the compact domain, explains the larger rmsd obtained for RBD2 (Table 1). The structures of the RBD1 and RBD2 domains of U1A (Avis et al., 1996; Lu & Hall, 1997; Nagai et al., 1990) and U2AF65 (Ito et al., 1999) also differ signi®cantly from each other. In contrast, the RBD1 and RBD2 domains of sex-lethal (Crowder et al., 1999), HuC (Inoue et al., 2000), polyA binding protein (Deo et al., 1999) and hnRNPA1 (Shamoo et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1997), which all bind single-stranded RNA, are almost superimposable on each other. The structural differences between the two domains of

nucleolin RBD12 are likely important elements in its speci®c recognition of the target stem-loop structure. Comparison of the structures of nucleolin RBD1 and RBD2 with other RBD structures While both RBD1 and RBD2 adopt the expected tertiary fold, the location of the b2 strands of RBD1 and RBD2 differs from what was predicted based on sequence alignment alone (Birney et al., 1993; Bouvet et al., 1997). The b2 strand of RBD1 was predicted to be from L43 to R49 but it is shifted to from V45 to G51 (Figure 2(c)). The important consequence of this is that the b2-b3 loop of RBD1 is shorter (only four amino acid residues instead of 6) and a-helix 1 is longer (15 residues instead of 12) than originally predicted. In similar way, for RBD2 the b2 strand was predicted to be from L128 to K134 but is actually from A123 to V129 (Figure 2(d)). In this case, the b2-b3 loop of RBD2 is longer (eight amino acid residues instead of three) and a-helix 1 is shorter (nine residues instead of 11) than originally predicted. A similar disagreement between a predicted secondary structure and the actual structure was also observed for the recent NMR structure of RBD1 domain of U2AF65 (Ito et al., 1999) (see Figure 4). It is interesting to note that it is always the position of the b2 strand that is incorrectly predicted. The dif®culty in predicting the position of b2 comes from the fact that there is no strong sequence conservation among the different RBDs in the b2 strand (Birney et al., 1993). In addition, the length of a-helix 1 and the loops before and after the b2 strand are not highly conserved. The variability in the sequence and location of the b2 strand may be related to its

importance in the RNA-binding speci®city of RBD proteins. In all of the structures of protein-RNA complexes solved to date, side-chains of the b2 strand are found to interact with RNA and contribute to the speci®c recognition (Allain et al., 1996; Deo et al., 1999; Handa et al., 1999; Oubridge et al., 1994; Price et al., 1998). In several cases the b2 strands have been involved in inter-domain interactions or protein-protein interactions. Examples include the polyA binding protein (Deo et al., 1999) and sex-lethal protein-RNA complexes (Handa et al., 1999), in which the b2 strand of RBD2 interacts with the b4 strand of RBD1, and the U2BHH U2AH -RNA ternary complex (Price et al., 1998), in which the b2 strand of U2BHH interacts with U2AH . As discussed, the tertiary fold of nucleolin RBD1 shows that a-helix 1 has one extra turn at its N terminus compared to what is predicted for most RBDs based on sequence alignment as well as most of the structures solved to date (Figure 4). A similarly located long a-helix 1 is found in the structures of the N-terminal RBD (RBD1) of U1A (Avis et al., 1996; Nagai et al., 1990) and U2BHH (Price et al., 1998). The RBD1 of U2AF65 also has a long a-helix 1, but the extra turn is at the C rather than the N terminus of the helix (Figure 4). Although the fold is similar, nucleolin RBD1 differs from U1A RBD1 by the presence of a very short b2-b3 loop (four amino acid residues compare to seven for U1A) (Figure 4). The region just N-terminal of b1 of RBD1 (S10-T12) interacts with the surface of the b-sheet of RBD1; speci®cally, S10, T11 and T12 contact V46, D47 of b2 and D60 of b3. This is similar to what was found in the free U1A (Avis et al., 1996) and hnRNPA1 (Shamoo et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1997) proteins, where a helix (C-

233 residues of RBD12 (Figure 5(b)). Regions of ¯exibility, as assessed by low 1H-15N NOEs (Kay et al., 1989), are found primarily in the ®rst ten or so residues at the N terminus of RBD1, which are not part of the RBD consensus, the RBD12 linker region, and the b2-b3 loop of RBD2. Most of the residues in the linker between RBD1 and RBD2 (89-100), particularly K89 through K94, show low 1 H-15N NOEs of between 0.25 and 0.5, indicative of a ¯exible region. In the a-helical part of the linker (93-99), the residues appear somewhat more rigid. The two RBDs in both sex-lethal (Crowder et al., 1999; Handa et al., 1999) and HuC (Inoue et al., 2000) have also been found to be joined by a ¯exible linker and not to interact in the free proteins. The two RBDs of hnRNPA1 also have a ¯exible linker, but in contrast to nucleolin RBD12, sex-lethal, and HuC the two domains interact extensively in the free protein via their a-helix 2 (Ding et al., 1999; Shamoo et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1997). The ¯exibility of the b2-b3 loop of RBD2 is consistent with the lower precision of the structure found in this region of the protein (Figure 3). Flexible b2-b3 loops were found in the NMR structures of several other RBD proteins, i.e. sex-lethal (Lee et al., 1994), hnRNP D0 (Nagata et al., 1999b), HuC (Inoue et al., 2000), U2AF65 RBD2 (Ito et al., 1999) and Musashi 1 (Nagata et al., 1999a). Interaction of RBD12 with its RNA recognition element RBD12 binds speci®cally to RNA stem-loops containing the sequence (U/G)CCCG(A/G) in the loop (Ghisol®-Nieto et al., 1996). The length of the loop can vary from 7 to 14 nt, but the loop needs to contain the six nucleotide consensus sequence in order for the protein to bind with high af®nity. We have studied the interaction of RBD12 with the RNA for which it has the highest af®nity (2 nM), a 22 nt stem-loop RNA containing the sequence identi®ed via SELEX (Ellington & Szostak, 1990; Ghisol®-Nieto et al., 1996; Irvine et al., 1991) (Figure 1(c)). Titration of the RNA into the protein showed that the complex is in slow exchange on the NMR time scale (data not shown). Good linewidths were obtained for the complex despite its fairly large molecular weight (28 kDa), as shown in Figures 6(a) and 7(a). The assignments of the resonances of the protein in the complex were obtained by analysis of three 3D spectra

terminal to the b-sheet in U1A, N-terminal in hnRNPA1) interacts with the surface of the b-sheet. In contrast to RBD1, the tertiary fold of nucleolin RBD2 is most similar to the majority of RBDs for which structures have been determined, e.g. sexlethal (Crowder et al., 1999; Lee et al., 1994), U2AF65 RBD2 (Ito et al., 1999), polyA binding protein (Deo et al., 1999), HuC (Inoue et al., 2000), U1A RBD2 (Lu & Hall, 1997), Musashi 1 (Nagata et al., 1999a), hnRNP D0 (Nagata et al., 1999b), hnRNP C (Wittekind et al., 1992) and hnRNPA1 (Shamoo et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1997), with a shorter a-helix 1 and a longer b2-b3 loop (Figure 4). The RBD2 construct also includes residues 93 to 100 of the linker region near the C terminus. These residues form a C-terminal 310-helix from S93 to A99. This helix is similar to the ones found in the linker region between the RBDs 1 and 2 of U1A (Howe et al., 1994), sex-lethal (Handa et al., 1999), hnRNPA1 (Ding et al., 1999), and polyA binding protein (Deo et al., 1999). In RBD12, RBD1 and RBD2 do not interact The 1H-15N TROSY (Czisch & Boelens, 1998; Salzmann et al., 1998) spectrum of the free RBD12 protein is nearly superimposable on the sum of the two 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the individual domains (compare Figure 5(a) and Figure 2(a) and (b)). Most of the resonance assignments of RBD12 were therefore easily obtained by comparison of the RBD12 spectra with the spectra of the individual RBD1 and RBD2. The assignments of the linker resonances were obtained using a 3D 15N total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY)-HSQC and a PEPPFG 15N NOESY-HSQC (Cavanagh et al., 1996). Since no chemical shift changes are observed outside the linker region, we conclude that the two domains adopt the same structure in the full protein as the individual domains. Furthermore, the lack of interdomain NOEs indicates that they do not interact stably with one another. In the structure of nucleolin RBD12, the linker region (89-100) is ¯exible, with residues 89 to 92 unstructured and 93 to 99 forming the same helix that is found at the N terminus of the individual domain of RBD2 (Figures 3(c) and 4). Therefore, the orientation of the two domains with respect to one another is not de®ned in solution. To con®rm that the linker region is indeed ¯exible, we measured the 1H-15N NOEs for the amide

Since the linker region (green) is ¯exible and no NOEs are observed between the two RBDs, the orientation of the two RBDs relative to one another is not de®ned in solution. The structure shown has the two RBDs oriented in such a way that their b-strands can interact with the RNA. Side-chains of F17, Y58, L103, and Y140 shown on the structure have intermolecular NOEs to the RNA loop nucleotides (Figure 7).

resonances do not show signi®cant chemical shift changes upon complex formation (Figure 6(b)), indicating that the fold of the protein in the free state is largely conserved in the complex. Only very small chemical shift changes are observed for most of the residues in the a-helices. The largest chemical shift differences (jÁNdj  jÁHdj > 100 Hz) between main-chain amide resonances of the free protein and of the complex are observed for residues of the b-sheet of both RBDs, the linker (K89

to R100), the b2-b3 loop of RBD1 (T52-K55), the region N-terminal to RBD1 (S10,T11), the region Cterminal to RBD2 (G172,E173), and surprisingly the loop between b1 and a-helix 1 of RBD1 (N22 to A28) (Figure 6(b)). Large chemical shifts (between 1 and 2 ppm down®eld) are also observed for the arginine He-Ne of R49 (b2 of RBD1), R91 (linker) and R127 (b2 of RBD2) (Figures 5(a) and 6(a)). Note that except for V129, D132 and K136, the amide resonances of the b2-b3 loop of RBD2 (V129

to K136) do not show major chemical shift changes. Chemical shift mapping of other RBD proteins bound to RNA, i.e. hnRNP C (Gorlach et al., 1992), U1A (Howe et al., 1994), sex-lethal (Lee et al., 1997) and HuC (Inoue et al., 2000) has shown chemical shift differences of similar magnitude. Analysis of the difference between the 1H-15N NOE (Kay et al., 1989) intensities in the complex and in the free protein shows that the main region of signi®cant difference between the two is in residues of the interdomain linker (Figure 6(c)). This indicates that the linker, which is ¯exible in the free protein, becomes ordered in the complex. Since this is also a region which shows some of the largest chemical shift changes between the free protein and the complex, the linker appears to play a signi®cant role in the protein-RNA complex. In contrast, the b2-b3 loop of RBD2 is ¯exible in both the free protein (Figure 5(b)) and in the complex (Figure 6(c)), indicating that it probably does not interact with the RNA. Both sex-lethal (Handa et al., 1999) and hnRNPA1 (Ding et al., 1999) also have a ¯exible interdomain linker which becomes ordered upon binding to RNA and DNA, respectively. In a similar way, multiple zinc-®nger proteins are also connected by ¯exible linkers which become ordered in the protein-DNA complexes (Wuttke et al., 1997).

Intermolecular NOEs: evidence for stacking of RNA bases on protein aromatic rings of RBD1 and RBD2 In addition to the chemical shift perturbation experiment, which gives only a qualitative idea of where the RNA binds on the protein, we were able to observe and assign intermolecular NOEs between the protein sidechains of F17, Y58, L103, and Y140 and the RNA bases (Figure7(a)). The location of these side-chains on the surface of the b-sheet of RBD1 and RBD2 are shown in Figure 3(c). These intermolecular NOEs unambiguously show that Y140 of RBD2 stacks on C10 (NOEs from Y140 Hd and He to C10 H5 and H6) and that Y58 of RBD1 stacks on G13 (NOEs from Y58 Hd and He to G13 H8 and H1H ). These intermolecular NOEs together with the ones between L103 and U9 and between F17 and C12 (schematically shown on Figure 7(b)) provide a preliminary view of how the protein interacts with the RNA. The assigned NOEs indicate that RBD2 interacts with the 5H end of the RNA loop (U9 and C10) and RBD1 interacts with the 3H end of the loop (C12 and G13). These data correlate well with the genetic screening of the same protein-RNA complex which identi®ed a possible interaction between C10 and R127

238 of RBD2 (Bouvet et al., 1997). R127 is positioned very close to Y140 in RBD2 (Figure 2(d)). Since C10 stacks on Y140, R127 is likely in a position to interact with C10. R127 He is also one of the resonances which has the largest chemical shift change upon RNA binding (compare Figures 5(a) and 6(a)), which is also consistent with an interaction with the RNA. The observed NOE interactions are consistent with mutagenesis studies of nucleolin RBD12 which showed that mutations of F17 (Bouvet et al., 1997) Y58, and Y140 (Serin et al., 1997) decreased the binding af®nity for the sNRE (Serin et al., 1997). Based on these results it appears that RBD1 and RBD2 play equally important roles in the sequence speci®c recognition of the RNA, with each domain recognizingon opposite sides of the loop on at least two nucleotides via the surface of their b-sheet. This differs from the proposed model based on a genetic screening alone (Bouvet et al., 1997) which predicted that RBD1 played the predominant role and RBD2 interacted with the RNA only via its b2-b3 loop. Comparison with other RBD12-RNA complexes In spite of the large number of proteins containing RBDs and their importance (Varani & Nagai, 1998), the structures of only a few RBDs have been determined in complex with RNA, speci®cally U1A (Allain et al., 1996; Oubridge et al., 1994; Varani et al., 2000), U2BHH (Price et al., 1998), sexlethal (Handa et al., 1999), polyA binding protein (Deo et al., 1999), and hnRNPA1 in complex with DNA (Ding et al., 1999). Like nucleolin, U1A and U2BHH bind speci®cally to an RNA stem-loop but only one RBD is necessary to achieve speci®city, whereas nucleolin requires the two N-terminal RBDs. Sex-lethal, polyA binding protein, and hnRNPA1 need two RBDs to achieve speci®city, but they bind only single-stranded nucleic acids whereas nucleolin binds a stem-loop. We have found that RBD1 of nucleolin is very similar to the RBD1 of U1A and U2BHH , but that it lacks the long b2-b3 loop which is so important for the RNA binding speci®city of U1A and U2BHH . Therefore the mode of recognition of a stem-loop RNA by nucleolin must be different. It is clear from our study that, like sex-lethal, polyA binding protein, hnRNPA1 and more recently HuC (Inoue et al., 2000), nucleolin uses the b-sheet surfaces of the two RBDs to bind the RNA. It is interesting that for nucleolin RBD12 and these other proteinRNA complexes, the mode of binding has three elements in common. First, RBD2 always recognizes the 5H end of the single-stranded RNA and RBD1 recognizes its 3H end (Figure 7). Second, the mode of binding for both RBDs involves stacking between RNA bases and aromatic amino acid sidechains. Third, the linker region between the two RBDs becomes ordered in the complex (Figure 6(c)). However, since nucleolin RBD12 does not bind single-stranded RNA, the speci®c recognition of its RNA stem-loop substrate must be achieved in a

different way than the previously solved complexes. The solution structure of the complex should provide the molecular basis of this speci®c binding.

Material and Methods
Preparation of RBD1, RBD2 and RBD12 of nucleolin Protein constructs of subdomains of nucleolin containing the amino acid sequences for RBD1, RBD2, and RBD12 (Figure 1) were made as described (Serin et al., 1997), except that M9 media was used for the unlabeled protein preparation. The ®rst four amino acid residues (GSHM) in each protein are not from the nucleolin protein but come from the initiation of translation in the pET-15b vector. Unlabeled proteins for the NMR studies were expressed in BL21(DE3)plysS cells and grown as described (Serin et al., 1997) except that minimal media was used (Maniatis et al., 1982). The his-tagged proteins were puri®ed under denaturing conditions on a Qiagen Ni2 nitrilotriacetic acid resin column (QIAGEN) with 8 M urea. The protein was renatured on the column. After removal from the column, the proteins were further puri®ed using a Heparin Sepharose column (Pharmacia, Inc). For the initial studies, the His(6) tag was removed by cleavage with thrombin, but later studies were done with the His(6) protein. In the ®nal step of puri®cation, the proteins were loaded onto a Mono-Q column (Pharmacia) and eluted with a 50 mM-1 M KCl gradient (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.7)). Typical yields were 30 mg/l for RBD12 and RBD2 and 15 mg/l for RBD1. The proteins were concentrated by centrifugation on Centricon 10 (Amicon). Final sample conditions were $1 mM protein in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.2), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM deuterated DTT. Samples were prepared in 2H2O by lyophilization and redissolving in 99.996 % 2H2O. Proteins uniformly labeled with 15N or 15N, 13C were prepared as above, except that 1 g/l of 15NH4Cl and 4 g/l of 13C glucose were used in the minimal media. Preparation of the sNRE RNA The RNA sequence used here 5H (GGCCGAAAUCCCGAAGUAGGCC) (Figure 7(b)) was synthesized by in vitro transcription of a DNA template using T7 RNA polymerase (Milligan et al., 1987) and unlabelled NTPs. After enzymatic synthesis, the RNA was puri®ed by gel electrophoresis on 18 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gels followed by electroelution, DEAE column chromatography and desalting on a G15 column. The resulting RNA was lyophilized and used to prepare the NMR samples. Preparation of the protein-RNA complexes Since the protein denatures under low salt conditions, while the free RNA forms a hairpin only at low salt, RNA-protein complexes were formed by titrating the RNA into the protein. The protein was added to aliquots of lyophilized RNA (usually three to four times) until a 1:1 complex was obtained. Since the RNA in the complex is in slow exchange on the NMR time scale, the titration could be easily monitored by acquiring short 2D 1H-15N HMQC (Bax et al., 1983) spectra and observing resonances from the free protein disappearing and resonances from the complex appearing. Final sample conditions were 1 mM protein-RNA complex in a 1:1 ratio, in

Structure of Nucleolin RBD12 50 mM potassium phosphate, 100 mM KCl (pH 6.2). The protein-RNA complex is stable at temperatures ranging from 275 to 328 K. Most spectra of the complex were acquired at 293 and 303 K. NMR spectroscopy and assignment methodology All the NMR spectra were acquired at 500 MHz or 600 MHz on Bruker DRX spectrometers. Spectra were processed with Bruker Xwinnmr and analyzed using Felix97 and XEASY (Bartels et al., 1995). For RBD1 and RBD2, spectra were recorded at 293 K, for RBD12 at 293 K and 303 K, and for RBD12 in complex with RNA at 293 K, 303 K and 318 K.. RBD1 and RBD2 resonance assignments were obtained using the following methodology. Both double and triple resonance experiments were acquired for spectral assignment. HNCA and HNCOCA (Bax & Ikura, 1991) spectra were used for the sequential assignment of the backbone NH, N and Ca resonances. CBCACONH (Grzesiek & Bax, 1992b) and CBCANH (Grzesiek & Bax, 1992a) experiments were used to extend the correlations from NH to the Cb resonances. The sequential Cb connectivities identi®ed in these spectra were used to resolve ambiguities in the Ca connectivities. A series of 3D 15N NOESY-HSQC, 15N TOCSY-HSQC (Cavanagh et al., 1996), 13C HSQCNOESY (Majumdar & Zuiderweg, 1993) in 90 % H2O/ 10 % 2H2O and 13C NOESY-HMQC (Marion et al., 1989) (150 ms for the NOESY mixing time) and HCCH-TOCSY (Bax et al., 1990) in 2H2O spectra were acquired to complement the triple resonance experiments and to provide information as to the amino acid type and sequential NOEs. All NH detected spectra were acquired in 90 % H2O/10 % 2H2O using WATERGATE for water suppression (Piotto et al., 1992). A series of 3D 15N NOESY-HSQC, 15N TOCSY-HSQC, 13 C NOESY-HMQC, 13C HSQC-NOESY (tm  150 ms for all 3D NOESY experiments) were acquired on the free RBD12 protein and on RBD12 in complex with RNA. These spectra were suf®cient to obtain unambiguously assignments of RBD12 in the free state and in complex with the RNA. 2D 1H-15N TROSY (Czisch & Boelens, 1998; Pervushin et al., 1998) and 1H-15N NOE (Kay et al., 1989) measurements were done as described. Structure calculation of RBD1 and RBD2 Inter-proton distance constraints were obtained from 2D homonuclear NOESY spectra with mixing times of 30, 60, 90 and 150 ms and 3D 15N and 13C separated NOESY spectra with 150 ms mixing time recorded in 90 % H2O/10 % 2H2O and 99.9 % 2H2O. The NOE crosspeaks assigned in the 2D and 3D 15N-separated NOESY were integrated by SPSCAN and the volumes were converted into distance constraints using the CALIBA subroutine of XEASY (Bartels et al., 1995). Because of the spectral overlap observed in the 3D 13C-edited NOESY, the distance restraints derived from the assigned NOEs Ê were given only qualitative upper limits of 3.5, 5 or 7 A (plus a pseudo atom correction) based on the intensity of the cross-peak. 1335 and 1209 NOE-derived distance constraints were collected for RBD1 and RBD2, respectively (Table 1). In addition, hydrogen-bond constraints were added based on the observation of slowly exchanging amide protons after transfer of the protein from H2O to 2H2O. Twenty-eight and 35 were found for RBD1 and RBD2, respectively.

The ®rst rounds of structure calculations were done in dihedral space using the program DYANA (Guntert et al., 1997) using the standard protocol included in the program. When a good convergence rate (over 50 %) and Ê precision (below 1 A for the backbone atoms of the proteins) were achieved, calculations were run using the simulated annealing protocol implemented in X-PLOR 3.8 to obtain better van der Waals contacts. In the ®nal round of calculations, ®fty structures were calculated for each domain. The 33 and 34 lowest energy structures from the ensemble of converged structures for RBD1 and RBD2, respectively, were further analyzed and described (Table 1, Figure 3). RCSB Protein Data Bank accession codes The coordinates for the 33 and 34 lowest energy structures of RBD1 (accession number 1FJ7) and RBD2 (accession number 1FJC) have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank.
