Probing the Supramodular Architecture of a Multidomain Protein: The Structure of Syntenin in Solution

Clearly, a better understanding of the behavior of multidomain proteins in solution requires development of alternative approaches, including a synergistic use of X-ray diffraction models and NMR-derived data. Such an approach has been made possible with the introduction of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) as an alternative and complementary approach that has greatly expanded the scope of NMR methodology (Prestegard et al., 2000; Bax et al., 2001; de Alba and Tjandra, 2002; Bax, 2003). The RDCs make it possible to determine the orientation of specific bonds, such as 1H-15N peptide moieties for partially oriented molecules. While the determination of RDCs still requires full assignment of chemical shifts, the spectra can be analyzed in a significantly shorter time than standard NOE-based experiments. Furthermore, unlike the chemical shifts that cannot be predicted with very high accuracy, RDCs can easily be computed based on a set of crystallographic coordinates, making it easy to combine crystallographic and NMR data to generate a comprehensive description of structural properties of a given protein in solution. An even more powerful technique involves a combination of RDCs and the socalled ambiguous chemical shift restraints (Clore and Schwieters, 2003). This approach has been previously used in the docking of protein-protein complexes (Clore and Schwieters, 2003). In this report, we use this methodology to characterize the solution supramodular architecture of syntenin, a 32 kDa scaffolding protein with two PDZ domains arranged in a tandem, and N- and C-terminal fragments, hitherto presumed to be unstructured based on secondary structure prediction. PDZ domains--between 80 and 90 amino acids in size--are the most ubiquitous protein-protein interaction domains, and they are found exclusively in cytoplasmic, multidomain proteins, often in conjunction with one or more domains of other types (Nourry et al., 2003). They typically function by selective binding of C-terminal oligopeptides of other proteins, notably channels and receptors (Doyle et al., 1996; Hillier et al., 1999), and thus play a critical role in the organization of signaling complexes (Fan and Zhang, 2002). Syntenin was originally identified as a binding partner of the cytoplasmic domain of vertebrate syndecans (Grootjans et al., 1997). It is widely expressed, strongly associated with membranes, and plays a role in cytoskeleton-membrane organization (Zimmermann et al., 2001), protein trafficking, cell adhesion, and activation of the transcription factor Sox4 (Geijsen et al., 2001). These diverse physiological functions arise from the interactions of syntenin with a number of other proteins, including, among others, ephrins (Lin et al., 1999) and neurexins (Lin et al., 1999; Grootjans et al., 2000). Both the PDZ tandem of syntenin and the isolated second domain (PDZ2) have been studied by X-ray crystallography (Kang et al., 2003a, 2003b, 2004). These studies revealed that the PDZ tandem forms a head-totail homodimer, suggesting that dimerization may be a biologically relevant phenomenon, in concert with

Summary Full understanding of the mechanism of function of multidomain proteins is dependent on our knowledge of their supramodular architecture in solution. This is a nontrivial task for both X-ray crystallography and NMR, because intrinsic flexibility makes crystallization of these proteins difficult, while their size creates a challenge for NMR. Here, we describe synergistic application of data derived from X-ray crystallography and NMR residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) to address the question of the supramodular structure of a two-domain protein, syntenin. Syntenin is a 32 kDa molecule containing two PDZ domains and is involved in cytoskeleton-membrane organization. We show that the mutual disposition of the PDZ domains clearly differs from that seen in the crystal structure, and we provide evidence that N- and C-terminal fragments of syntenin, hitherto presumed to lack ordered structure, contain folded structural elements in the full-length protein in contact with the PDZ tandem. Introduction A large fraction of genes in eukaryotic genomes code for large, multidomain proteins, many of which are critically responsible for complex pathways of cell regulation. While X-ray crystallography and NMR have been successful at structural characterization of isolated domains and their binary complexes, the task of characterizing solution structures of full-length, multidomain proteins is an immense challenge to the two techniques. The intrinsic flexibility of most multidomain proteins makes it very difficult to grow diffracting single crystals, unless they can be induced to form a "closed," compact conformation. There is also the danger that crystal-packing forces may distort the structure of a protein with a high degree of intrinsic flexibility, or stabilize a conformer that is not representative of the structure in solution. On the other hand, while not dependent on crystalline samples, NMR methodology becomes

Crystal Structure of the Syntenin PDZ Tandem Dimer with Residues Colored According to the Extent of Differences in Chemical Shifts between Isolated PDZ Domains and in the Tandem Chemical shift differences were calculated according to the formula  = | HN| + 0.11*| N|. Red (PDZ1) and blue (PDZ2) correspond to residues with the largest chemical shift changes (  > 0.16 ppm), while yellow (PDZ1) and cyan (PDZ2) indicate smaller differences (0.16 >  > 0.08 ppm).

some other biochemical data (Koroll et al., 2001). The crystal structure showed a rigid supramodular architecture, which made it possibile for domain swapping to occur within the homodimer (Figure 1). Since the relative disposition of PDZ domains within multi-PDZ proteins is increasingly recognized as having an important biological role, our study was intended to answer the following unresolved issues: (a) is full-length syntenin dimeric or monomeric in solution?; (b) can we detect domain-swapping events in solution?; (c) do the domains retain in solution the supramodular architecture observed in the crystal?; (d) do the N and C termini, presumed to be unstructured, contain any folded elements interacting with the PDZ tandem? By combining the NMR-derived information based on the RDC measurements with the known crystal structures, we show that, in solution, syntenin is monomeric, and that its supramodular structure is significantly different from that seen in the crystal. We also present evidence that the C terminus affects the structure of the tandem, while the N-terminal fragment is unstructured. This investigation provides a powerful illustration of the complementary role of crystallography and solution NMR, and it shows how the combination of these techniques allows one to overcome the limitations of each of these methods when applied in isolation. Results Chemical Shift Analysis of Syntenin PDZ Domains As the first step in the study of the supramodular structure of syntenin in solution, we needed to compare

chemical shifts of the two isolated PDZ domains with those of the tandem. Both of the PDZ domains, PDZ1 and PDZ2, were individually expressed and purified (see the Experimental Procedures). As a prerequisite for the RDC analysis, it was necessary to obtain reasonably complete chemical shift assignments for amides by using samples of 15N-labeled proteins. This was accomplished based on the analysis of 15N-edited HSQCTOCSY, 15N-edited HSQC-NOESY, and HNHA experiments. The NMR 1H-15N HSQC spectra of both isolated PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains are well dispersed. Assignments of 1HN, 15N, and 1H chemical shifts were 100% and 90% complete for PDZ1 and PDZ2, respectively. Interestingly, the chemical shift assignment of the PDZ2 domain revealed that the backbone amide of Asn215 is strongly downfield shifted (HN = 12.66 ppm). Since there are no aromatic rings in the proximity of this amide, the unusually large chemical shift (one of the largest amide chemical shifts reported in the literature) must result from a very short hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp251. This is further corroborated by a large temperature coefficient for the amide of Asn215 ( HN/ T = -5.8 ppb/K) (Cierpicki et al., 2002). The crystal structure (PDB code 1N99) shows that the distance between the backbone nitrogen of Asn215 and the side chain oxygen of Asp251 is 2.56 Å. In order to compare the isolated PDZ domains to the PDZ tandem in solution, we also measured the 1H-15N HSQC spectra for the tandem. The comparisons of the spectra indicate that most of the amide chemical shifts do not vary significantly between the isolated domains and the tandem. Thus, the knowledge of the chemical shifts for the isolated domains was of significant help in the assignment of the PDZ tandem; consequently, 96% of the 1HN, 15N, and 1H resonances, including those corresponding to the linker region between the PDZ domains, were assigned. The observed differences in 1HN and 15N chemical shifts between isolated domains and the tandem are summarized in Figure 1. Interestingly, much stronger changes are observed for PDZ2 than for PDZ1, with the largest differences in residues 213­218 and 234­241. The crystal structure of the PDZ tandem shows that three aromatic rings (Phe154, Phe195, and Phe273) are buried in the surface between the PDZ domains; thus, ring current effects may be the source of some of the observed chemical shift changes. However, in spite of these localized differences, there are no substantial changes for residues within close proximity to the peptide binding sites. The PDZ Tandem in Solution The crystal structure of the PDZ tandem is consistent with a homodimeric structure, arranged head-to-tail; thus, PDZ1 in one monomer makes extensive contacts with PDZ2 of the other monomer in the asymmetric unit (Kang et al., 2003b). Probing whether the dimeric or monomeric state is predominant in solution, we carried out measurement of 15N relaxation times. The estimated correlation times, inversely proportional to the tumbling rate of the molecules in solution, determined for PDZ1, PDZ2, and for the tandem from 15N relaxation time ratios (T1/T2) are 4.7 ± 0.2, 4.5 ± 0.5, and 10.0 ±

0.5 ns, respectively. The predicted values, assuming an axially symmetric model for the tandem, are 13 and 26 ns for a monomeric and dimeric species, respectively (see the Experimental Procedures). Thus, the experimental NMR data for the tandem are consistent with a predominantly monomer state of the protein in solution. In order to gain a qualitative insight into the backbone mobility within the tandem, we compared the 15 N{1H} NOEs for each isolated domain with those measured for the tandem. A relatively uniform distribution of NOEs was observed with average values of 0.77 ± 0.05, 0.76 ± 0.03, and 0.75 ± 0.08 for PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ12, respectively. Interestingly, the NOE values for the residues within the linker region between PDZ1 and PDZ2 (i.e., Phe195, Glu196, and Arg197) are not diminished. This strongly suggested that the two PDZ domains have fixed relative orientations within the tandem. The Relative Orientation of the PDZ Domains in the Tandem Next, we determined the mutual dispositions of the two PDZ domains in the tandem, based on the RDCs. To measure the latter, several samples with different gel compositions were used to find optimal conditions for inducing the weak alignment. We observed an alignment of the tandem in compressed copolymer polyacrylamide gels (see the Experimental Procedures). Two sets of 1DHN values were measured, and the experimental values of RDCs ranged from -14 to +15 Hz and from -11.5 to +14.5 Hz for 50+M and 75+M, respectively. However, the correlation coefficient between the two data sets (r) is 0.97, and the alignments are virtually identical. Qualitative compatibility between dipolar couplings and the corresponding crystal structures were evaluated by using the quality factor Q (Cornilescu et al., 1998). A value of zero indicates a perfect fit, while, in reality, a value of approximately 20% corresponds to a very good fit between the two sets of observations (Ottiger and Bax, 1999). In order to select structures of the component PDZ domains that most accurately represent the structure in solution, we compared the quality factors (Q) for individual domains from the tandem. Values of Q calculated by using the 75+M data set for monomer A are 22.3% (PDZ1A) and 22.1% (PDZ2A), and, for monomer B, Q values are 28.5% (PDZ1B) and 22.5% (PDZ2B). Thus, monomer A represents the structure in solution better. However, the quality factor calculated for the crystal structure of the tandem (PDZ12A) is 27.7% (Table 1), which is significantly higher than that of the individual domains, indicating a possibility of altered interdomain orientation in solution. Indeed, the magnitudes of alignment tensors obtained from the best fit of measured and calculated RDCs based on the crystal structures of individual PDZ domains are very similar, although the relative orientations of PDZ1 and PDZ2 are noticeably different (Table 1). We then used the RDCs for each individual PDZ domain to determine the relative orientations of these modules in the PDZ tandem in solution. We first aligned the coordinates of the PDZ tandem to the alignment tensor frame of PDZ1 and rotated the crystal structure by -26°, 18°, and -42° about the x, y, and z axes,

respectively. Under those circumstances, the alignment tensor of PDZ2 is rotated with respect to that of PDZ1 by -5°, 3°, and -23° around the x, y, and z axes, respectively (Table 1). Application of the above transformation to PDZ2 yielded the architecture of the PDZ tandem that is consistent with the dipolar couplings recorded in solution. The resulting quality factor calculated for the tandem upon reorientation of the PDZ domains dropped from 27.7% to 22.7% and is similar to that calculated for the individual domains. The magnitude of the angular errors in domain orientation calculated from the residual dipolar couplings has been evaluated by using the jack-knife procedure (Mosteller and Tukey, 1977) and through a comparison of two sets of dipolar couplings. The two data sets are very similar, and the differences do not exceed 1.5° in rotation about each of the axes. Since the analysis of the RDCs from a single alignment gives rise to 4-fold degeneracy with respect to orientations of the fragments, we had to consider the possibility of an alternate interdomain arrangement. Thus, we constructed a domain-swapped tandem represented by PDZ1A and PDZ2B, and we assessed the compatibility of this model with the experimentally determined RDCs. The agreement was poor, as judged by the very high value of the quality factor (72.8%), and adjusting alignment tensors would require significant reorientation of the PDZ2 relative to PDZ1 (rotation by 73°, -55°, and -69° about the x, y, and z axes, respectively). Furthermore, the domain-swapped structure is less consistent with the chemical shift data (Figure 1). Supramodular Structure of the PDZ Tandem Although the RDCs allow for an accurate determination of the relative orientations of the domains, they do not provide information regarding the relative translations. To obtain a complete structural description of the tandem, it is necessary to obtain additional information with respect to the interdomain interface. Such information can be derived from the comparison of chemical shifts between isolated PDZ domains and the PDZ tandem (Figure 1) and their use in the form of ambiguous distance restraints for structure calculations (Clore and Schwieters, 2003). The structure of the PDZ domain tandem calculated by using RDCs is shown in Figure 2A. An extensive set of intradomain restraints was used to preserve a rigid backbone structure during the simulation. The root mean square deviations (rmsd) between main chain atoms of the ten lowest-energy conformers of PDZ1 and PDZ2 relative to crystal structure are 0.10 Å and 0.17 Å, respectively. While the relative orientation of PDZ domains was restricted during the simulation due to the use of dipolar couplings, the key point to obtain a compact structure of the PDZ12 was the application of ambiguous distance restraints derived from chemical shifts analysis. The ambiguous distance restraint was not violated more than 0.2 Å in the final structures of PDZ12, and there are no steric clashes at the interface between the PDZ domains. Nevertheless, we observed that, in three out of ten structures calculated by using the 75+M set of RDCs, one domain is translationally shifted relative to the second domain by 4 Å (not shown).

Highly ambiguous distance restraints constructed on the basis of chemical shift comparison do not discriminate between interdomain contact and small intradomain structural changes. Thus, they may contain erroneous information, eventually leading to a set of incorrect structures. Such errors can be eliminated by inspecting all sets of calculated structures (Clore and Schwieters, 2003). The translational movement is very unlikely to occur, since it decreases the contact area between the PDZ domains. The three incorrect structures were accordingly eliminated from further analysis. Such structures have not been observed in calculations with a second set of RDCs (50+M). Comparison of the tandem structures calculated by using 50+M (magenta) and 75+M (green) RDC data is shown in Figure 2A. A superposition of a representative solution conformer of PDZ12 (blue) and the crystal structure of PDZ12_A (green; monomer A from the crystal structure) is shown in Figure 2B. Relative rotation of PDZ2 is clearly visible, and root mean square deviation between main chain atoms of the two PDZ2 domains is 3.9 Å.

As a consequence, a number of backbone atoms are translationally shifted by more than 5 Å relative to the crystal structure. In order to examine whether isolated PDZ domains are able to interact in solution, we performed an NMR titration experiment in which unlabeled PDZ2 was added to 15N-labeled PDZ1 in a 1:1 molar ratio (data not shown). Since no chemical shifts of PDZ1 were affected, we concluded that the covalent linker between the domains is necessary to maintain the contact between the PDZ domains. The N and C Termini Structural analysis of modular proteins is often limited to domains with well-defined tertiary structures. While the protein-protein interactions are frequently mediated by these globular domains, the presence of full-length, intact proteins including unfolded fragments is necessary for the expression of full biological function. Detailed study of such unstructured fragments is difficult. In the case of syntenin, over 45% of the polypeptide

chain extends beyond the domain boundaries. The crystal structure of the PDZ tandem (Kang et al., 2003b) did not include the N- and C-terminal fragments. In order to address the question of whether the terminal fragments of the protein form any contacts with PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains, possibly modulating their structure and interactions, we prepared 15N-labeled full-length syntenin (FL). Despite the large size of the FL protein, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum shows relatively narrow signals corresponding to the PDZ12 fragment. Additionally, the severely overlapped region in the center of the spectrum is characteristic of the unstructured N and C termini (Figure 3). Interestingly, the detailed comparison of the full-length protein and tandem spectra indicates distinct differences, including an increase in the number of signals in the folded region (see below). In order to evaluate the effects of the N and C termini, we analyzed two additional syntenin constructs: N-PDZ12 (residues 1­273) and PDZ12-C (residues 113­298). Comparison of 1H-15N HSQC spectra for all syntenin fragments measured under identical conditions is shown in Figure 4. The spectrum of N-PDZ12 is very similar to that of the PDZ tandem and contains a number of additional resonances arising from the N terminus (as seen for FL in Figure 3). All of these extra signals are found to lie within the random-coil region, indicating that this fragment is unstructured. However, the addition of the N-terminal extension causes numer-

ous shifts for resonances within the tandem portion (Figure 4A). In order to unambiguously assign these changes, we prepared an additional sample by mixing equimolar amounts of 15N-labeled N-PDZ12 and PDZ12. In such an experiment, two peaks with diminished intensities should be observed for all amides that differ in chemical shifts between PDZ12 and N-PDZ12. We analyzed all of the signals that were not overlapped with the N terminus and found that all amides with affected chemical shifts belong to PDZ1 and lie in close proximity to the N terminus. Thus, in spite of the fact that numerous amides have been affected, it is most likely that all perturbations of chemical shifts are caused by the attachment of the N-terminal polypeptide that is most likely unstructured and does not interfere with the PDZ tandem. Unlike the spectrum of N-PDZ12, the spectrum of PDZ12-C shows numerous broadened resonances (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the sample of PDZ12-C is not stable in solution and tends to precipitate even at low concentration. The observed signal broadening may indicate an increased propensity of the protein to aggregate upon addition of the 25 C-terminal residues to the tandem. The spectrum of PDZ12-C indicates numerous chemical shift changes relative to the PDZ tandem alone (Figure 4B); however, due to strong signal broadening, a reliable assignment of the affected residues is not possible. Interestingly, full-length syntenin is more

ple, the spectrum of the full-length protein reveals the presence of an upfield-shifted amide with a proton chemical shift of 6.34 ppm (Figure 3). A complete assignment of full-length syntenin would be necessary to localize these changes to specific residues. However, this would require a substantial effort due to the protein size and the complexity of the spectra and thus falls outside the scope of this project. The comparison of the different fragments and the full-length protein shows that the presence of both termini is necessary for maintaining the proper structure of syntenin. It is likely that residues from the C-terminal fragment of syntenin, and possibly the N terminus, are at least partly structured and interact with the PDZ domains. Discussion Regulatory and scaffolding proteins often contain multiple PDZ domains, frequently closely spaced along the sequence (Jelen et al., 2003; Nourry et al., 2003). Such architecture is important for their function, as has been demonstrated, for example, for the first two PDZ domains of PSD-95, a protein mediating ion channel clustering (Imamura et al., 2002). At least some multi-PDZ proteins have defined supramodular architectures, and their interactions with binding partners display a higher level of complexity (Feng et al., 2003; Im et al., 2003; Long et al., 2003). Furthermore, sequence analyses indicate that PDZ domains are frequently connected by short linkers of conserved length, which may impose constraints on the mutual disposition of the adjacent domains. The structure of the PSD-95 PDZ domain tandem revealed restricted orientation of PDZ domains, leading to concerted orientation of peptide binding sites (Long et al., 2003). Similarly, the solution structure of the tandem of PDZ4 and PDZ5 from the glutamate receptor interacting protein (GRIP) revealed that PDZ domains form a compact structure with a fixed interdomain architecture (Feng et al., 2003). Supramodular organization may also result from multimerization of PDZ domains. The recently reported structure of the Shank PDZ domain shows a tightly associated dimer that is maintained both in solution and in the crystal (Im et al., 2003). A dimeric association may facilitate binding to dimeric ligands such as PIX (Im et al., 2003). Despite their small size and simple structure, PDZ domains display a broad spectrum of interaction modes, the knowledge of which is crucial for the understanding of the architecture of signaling complexes. In this report, we address the question of the domain orientation and supramodular structure of the syntenin's PDZ tandem, as determined by using residual dipolar couplings and chemical shifts. Our study shows that the PDZ tandem is monomeric in solution, and that the two domains tumble as a single unit with a rotational correlation time of 10 ns. The mutual arrangement of the PDZ domains in solution has also been determined from residual dipolar couplings. While the rearrangement is similar to that seen in the crystal structure, the domains are rotated approximately -5°, 3°, and -23° about the x, y, and z axes, respectively (Figure 2B). This difference leads to a rearrangement of the buried surfaces at the PDZ1/PDZ2 interface. In the crystal struc-

stable relative to PDZ12-C, and a high-resolution spectrum was measured (Figure 3). A comparison of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the full-length protein and PDZ12 reveals broader signals (Figure 4C), but this effect can be attributed to a larger molecular weight of full-length syntenin (32 kDa relative to 19 kDa for PDZ12). The most interesting feature of the FL spectrum is that nearly all resonances are shifted relative to the tandem. Furthermore, we could identify additional signals indicating that, most likely, several residues outside the PDZ domains are structured as well. For exam-

ture of the PDZ tandem, this interface is actually much smaller than the intermolecular contact, i.e., the interface between the PDZ1 and PDZ2 that belong to the different monomers (Kang et al., 2003b). While the intramolecular surface area buried between the two PDZ domains within monomers A and B is 283Å2 and 340 Å2, respectively, the intermolecular contacts are almost twice as extensive (547 Å2 and 573 Å2 for PDZ1A-PDZ2B and PDZ1B-PDZ2A, respectively). Thus, reorientation of the domains observed for the solution structure is most likely driven by a significant increase of the intramolecular contact surface between PDZ1 and PDZ2, which we estimate to be w480 Å2. Clearly, the crystallization process and crystal-packing forces select a conformation that is significantly different from the one in solution. Similar effects have been reported in other cases. For example, the solution structure of lysozyme derived from RDCs differs from the crystal structures, and the cleft between the two domains is significantly larger in solution (Goto et al., 2001). Similarly, the MBP/-cyclodextrin complex has a different architecture in solution than in the crystalline state (Evenas et al., 2001). It is clear that synergistic application of residual dipolar couplings and crystal structures of individual domains leads to a much more accurate determination of the architecture of modular proteins in solution. Our work also illustrates the structural consequences of the presence of partly unfolded fragments in the protein. This is supported by the NMR spectrum of the fulllength syntenin. While the addition of the N-terminal fragment affects only signals within PDZ1, the presence of the C-terminal fragment leads to strong chemical shift changes accompanied by a severe signal broadening effect as a result of aggregation. The full-length syntenin has a noticeably lower tendency to aggregate, and, consequently, high-resolution spectra can be recorded. The comparison of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the full-length protein relative to those of the tandem reveals an increased number of amide resonances with non-random-coil chemical shifts. This indicates that there are fragments extraneous to the PDZ domains that are structured in the full-length protein. It is likely that this involves the C-terminal fragment, although an interaction with the N terminus should not be ruled out. This observation is in agreement with thermodynamic studies previously reported for syntenin that show that the full-length protein unfolds cooperatively and is more stable by 2 kcal/mol compared to the isolated tandem (Kang et al., 2003b). Whether or not this effect modulates syntenin's function and/or peptide binding requires further study.
Experimental Procedures Theory The residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) emerge from incomplete averaging of dipole-dipole interactions in solution NMR and provide information about the orientation of internuclear vectors relative to the magnetic field (Prestegard et al., 2000; Bax et al., 2001; de Alba and Tjandra, 2002; Bax, 2003). RDCs between pairs of nuclei are defined by: DIS = - 0hIS 3 Aa(3cos2 - 1) + Arsin2cos2f , 3 163rIS 2

where I and S are gyromagnetic ratios of interacting nuclei, rIS is a distance between I and S,  and f describe the orientation of the IS intermolecular vector relative to molecular alignment tensor, and Aa and Ar are axial and rhombic components of the alignment tensor, respectively. The dipolar coupling between a pair of 1H and 15N nuclei can be simplified as follows: DIS = Da (3cos2 - 1) +

[

3 Rsin2cos2f , 2

]

(2)

where Da is the magnitude of the alignment tensor normalized to interaction between 1HN and 15N nuclei, and R is rhombicity. Parameters of the alignment tensor (Da and R) can be obtained from best fitting experimental RDCs to the known structure (Losonczi et al., 1999). This procedure additionally yields the Euler angles (, , and ) defining rotation of molecular coordinates relative to the alignment tensor frame. Thus, a combination of RDCs and structures determined by either NMR or crystallographic analysis may be conveniently used to establish the relative orientation of molecular fragments in solution (Fischer et al., 1999). Protein Purification Six different syntenin fragments have been prepared: full-length protein (1­298), N-PDZ12 (1­273), PDZ1 (113­193), PDZ2 (197­270), PDZ12 (113­273), PDZ12-C (113­298). All proteins were uniformly 15 N labeled by overexpression in minimal media containing (15NH4)2SO4 as a sole nitrogen source. Purification of GST-fused proteins has been carried out according to a previously published protocol (Kang et al., 2003b). All NMR samples contained between 0.2 and 0.6 mM protein, 1 mM DTT, and 150 mM NaCl in either 50 mM phosphate buffer ( pH 6.5) or 50 mM TRIS buffer (pH 7.5). NMR Spectroscopy NMR spectra were collected by using Varian Inova 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers. NMR experiments have been typically collected at 30°C. Chemical shift assignment was based on a series of threedimensional experiments: 15N-separated HSQC-TOCSY (Zhang et al., 1994), 15N-separated HSQC-NOESY with 150 ms mixing time (Zhang et al., 1994), and HNHA (Vuister and Bax, 1993). Measurement of residual dipolar couplings was based on two-dimensional IPAP-type 1H-15N HSQC spectra (Ottiger et al., 1998). Transformation of and analysis of NMR spectra were carried out in NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995) and Sparky (Goddard and Kneller, 2004). Relaxation and Dynamics A standard set of experiments at 600 MHz was used to collect data for determination of 15N T1 and T2 relaxation times and 15N{1H} NOE (Farrow et al., 1994). Measurements have been carried out for 0.5 mM proteins in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 6.5), 150 mM NaCl with the addition of 1 mM DTT. Two sets of measurements for PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ12 have been carried out at 25°C and 30°C, respectively. T1 relaxation was obtained from a series of experiments with 10, 80, 160, 240, 400, 650, 900, and 1400 ms time delays. For T2 measurements, seven delays were used: 10, 30, 50, 90, 130, 170, and 230 ms. 15N{1H} NOE was obtained by recording one experiment with very little excitation of protons and a second experiment at saturating power with a 3 s irradiation period (Farrow et al., 1994). Experimental correlation times were calculated from the R2/R1 ratio by using r2r1_tm (Lee et al., 1997). Prediction of global correlation times for monomeric and dimeric structures of the PDZ tandem was obtained by using HYDRONMR, assuming axially symmetric models (Garcia de la Torre et al., 2000). Alignment in Polyacrylamide Gels Strained polyacrylamide-based hydrogels were introduced recently as inert and very stable orienting media (Sass et al., 2000; Ishii et al., 2001). Further modifications of the gel composition makes it possible to prepare charged copolymers that are stable at low concentrations and are suitable for studying large proteins (Meier et al., 2002; Ulmer et al., 2003). In our initial studies, we were unsuccessful with achieving alignment of the syntenin tandem by using DMPC:DHPC bicelles (Bax and Tjandra, 1997) and negatively charged polyacrylamide copolymer gels (Meier et al., 2002), due to very strong broadening of protein signals. Recently, we developed

a series of charged copolymers that are suitable for inducing the weak alignment of proteins (Cierpicki and Bushweller, 2004). The alignment of the syntenin tandem was successfully obtained by using two positively charged gels: 50% (3-acrylamidopropyl)-trimethylammonium chloride/50% acrylamide (referred to hereafter as 50+M) and 75% (3-acrylamidopropyl)-trimethylammonium chloride/25% acrylamide (referred to hereafter as 75+M). Analysis of RDCs Values of 1DHN were calculated from the difference between coupling constants measured in the absence and the presence of the gel. Determination of alignment tensor parameters (Da and R) and Euler angles (, , and ) defining rotations of molecular coordinates about the x, y, and z axes, relative to the principal axes frame of alignment tensor, was carried out by using PALES (Zweckstetter and Bax, 2000) and the crystal structure of the PDZ tandem (PDB code 1N99). Compatibility between experimental and calculated RDCs was evaluated based on quality factors Q calculated from the formula: Q = rms(Dcalc - Dobs)/rms(Dobs) (Cornilescu et al., 1998). Analysis of Domain Orientation Initially, we carried out fitting of experimental 1DHN to crystal structures of individual PDZ domains. For calculation of quality factors, we selected PDZ12A as the best representative of PDZ domain structures in solution. All subsequent rotations have been performed relative to the coordinate system from the original crystal structure, with the origin located near the linker between PDZ1 and PDZ2. Euler angles determined for PDZ1 were used to rotate the tandem structure to the principal axis frame of the PDZ1 alignment tensor. For the transformed coordinates, we calculated Euler angles for PDZ2 defining the rotation necessary to match alignment of PDZ1. Applying the transformation to PDZ2 only, we obtained the tandem structure with reoriented domains that is consistent with RDC data. Evaluation of the error in determination of alignment tensor and domain orientation has been done by using the jackknife procedure (Mosteller and Tukey, 1977) by performing 100 cycles of calculation with random elimination of 10% of the data. Structure Calculation The calculation of the syntenin tandem structure has been carried out by using low-temperature simulated annealing with rigid body structures of individual domains (Goto et al., 2001), with the addition of ambiguous interdomain distance restraints derived from 1 N 15 H / N chemical shift changes (Clore and Schwieters, 2003). In order to keep a rigid backbone conformation of the PDZ domains, we applied tight distance and dihedral angle restraints derived from the crystal structures. Separate sets of constraints for PDZ1 (residues 113­193) and PDZ2 (residues 198­270) were generated with Molmol (Koradi et al., 1996). Distance constraints were created for all pairs of backbone N, C, and C atoms separated by less than 6 Å, and the dihedral angles were composed for f, , and  angles. Furthermore, we included a list of residual dipolar couplings and ambiguous distance restraints describing interdomain contacts. In order to transform information from chemical shift analysis into highly ambiguous distance restraints, we used a procedure similar to that proposed by Clore and Schwieters (2003). The difference in chemical shifts between isolated PDZ domains and the tandem have been calculated by using the following formula:  = | HN| + 0.11*| N|. Highly ambiguous distance restraints were created between all amides from PDZ1 and PDZ2 with  > 0.08 ppm. For the constructed distance, we arbitrarily assigned lower and upper bounds of 2 Å and 5 Å, respectively. All calculations were performed with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) with similar parameters to those described previously (Goto et al., 2001). Torsion angle dynamics at 200 K for 15 ps and 3 fs time steps were followed by a slow cooling stage in 5 K steps during a 150 ps simulation. Van der Waals scaling factor was ramped from 0.1 to 1 kcal/mol, while the force constant for dipolar couplings was ramped from 0.05 to 0.5 kcal/mol Hz2. Distances and dihedral angles were restrained with a force constant of 200 kcal/mol Å2 and 500 kcal/mol rad2, respectively. At a final stage, the structures were minimized with ten cycles of conjugate gradient minimization.

The initial model of the PDZ tandem oriented by using RDCs has been used to calculate 100 structures. A family of ten structures with the best agreement between experimental and calculated RDCs has been selected for analysis. No distance violations larger than 0.2 Å or dihedral angle violations exceeding 5° were observed in the calculated structures. Separate calculations were performed for each set of RDCs.
