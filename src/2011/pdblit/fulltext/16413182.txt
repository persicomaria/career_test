Chronic hepatitis C infection is the primary cause for cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma leading to liver failure and transplantation. The etiological agent hepatitis C virus produces a single positive strand RNA that is processed further with the help of NS3 serine protease to produce mature virus. Inhibition of this protease can potentially be used to develop drugs for HCV infections. Boceprevir is a ketoamide derived novel inhibitor of HCV NS3 protease that has been progressed to clinical trials and proven to be efficacious in humans. Herein, we report our efforts in identifying an aza-peptide derivative as a potential second generation compound, that lacks electrophilic ketoamide group and are potent in enzyme and replicon assay.

Hepatitis C virus is the primary etiological agent responsible for non-A, non B infections of the liver.1 The prognosis for patients infected with hepatitis C is poor with a majority of these infections turning chronic progressing to cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. Pegylated alpha-interferon in combination with ribivirin is the primary standard of care which is effective in $50% of genotype-1 infected patients.2 Patients infected with genotype-2 respond better to Pegylated alpha-interferon with >80% of patients demonstrating sustained reduction in viral RNA.2 Lack of effective methods to treat genotype-1 infections and patients relapsing from interferon therapy necessitate discovery of new drugs. Significant efforts are now directed towards development of therapies that target key enzymes vital for HCV replication and maturation.3 Hepatitis C virus is a positive strand virus that encodes a single polyprotein of $3000 amino acids. This polyprotein which contains all the structural and functional proteins is post translationally modified by HCV NS3 protease.4 This enzyme with the assistance of cofactor NS4B catalyzes the cleavage of NS2­NS3, NS3­NS4A, NS4A­NS5B junctions to form functional proteins. HCV NS3, a serine protease has a shallow active site on the surface of the enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of cysteine­serine or a cysteine­threonine bond. Inhibition of this vital enzyme has been extensively investigated in an effort to develop potential drugs for the treatment of HCV infections. Boceprevir 15 and VX-950 are two ketoamide derived inhibitors that have been advanced to Phase-III clinical trails and demonstrated excellent efficacy in humans. In addition, macrocyclic inhibitors ITMN-191, MK7006 and TMC435350 have also been progressed to clinical studies and have demonstrated excel-

lent viral load reduction in patients. These compounds are currently being evaluated at various phases of clinical development. Boceprevir 1 (Fig. 1), is a ketoamide containing inhibitor that readily epimerizes in human serum under physiological conditions at the P1 center. The (S)-diastereomer at this center is the more potent isomer whereas the (R)-isomer is less active. Several attempts to avoid this epimerization by introduction of quaternary amino acids have resulted in significant loss in potency. A recent publication from a group at Boehringer Ingelhiem demonstrated that novel hydrazide derived inhibitor 2 spanning from P6 to P01 demonstrated excellent enzyme binding6 (Fig. 2). However these compounds were peptidic and no cellular activity in the replicon based assay was reported. From our experience in developing ketoamide derived clinical candidate 1, we discovered appropriate modifications of P2, P3 and P4 moieties allowed truncation of inhibitors spanning from P6 to P01 achieving compounds with lower molecular weights, desirable binding and pharmacokinetic profile. In this present work we envisioned that introduction of hydrazide analogs in our class of inhibitors may potentially provide compounds with better binding

than 2 and compounds with desirable cellular activity. In addition these modifications would depeptidize our compounds and provide inhibitors that are free of labile stereocenters which epimerized under physiological conditions. Pursuant to our identification of 1 we had also discovered that introduction of novel depeptidized P3 caps allowed improvement in binding and cellular activity of 1.7 In this Letter we disclose our efforts to identify novel hydrazide derived inhibitors with excellent binding and cellular activity. Synthesis of these hydrazide inhibitors is outlined in Schemes 1 and 2. Condensation of Boc-carbazate 3 with desired aldehyde resulted in hydrazone of type 4 which were reduced to alkylated hydrazides using NaBH4 and toluenesulfonic acid. The resulting alkylated hydrazides were acylated with acid chlorides or isocyanates to yield desired amides or ureas of type 6. These acylated derivatives were deprotected to form hydrazide salts of type 7 that were further used for syntheses of inhibitors. Coupling of dimethylcyclopropanated proline derivative 88 with P3 amino acid using HATU coupling agent9 resulted in dipeptides of type 9. The Boc group of 9 was deprotected using 4 M HCl in dioxane and capped with appropriate P3-capping group using corresponding isocyanate to yield compounds of type 10. The methyl ester 10 was hydrolyzed with aq lithium hydroxide and the resulting acid was coupled with hydrazide salt of type 7 to obtain azapeptide inhibitors of type 11. Synthesized inhibitors of type 11 were evaluated for their ability to inhibit HCV NS3 protease in a continuous assay as previously described10 to obtain a Ki. Compounds with good binding were further evaluated in a replicon based cellular assay to determine EC90. Based on our experience from ketoamide derived inhibitors we decided to evaluate inhibitors derived from dimethylcylclopropanated proline as P2, and glutarimide derived P3 capping. We first

evaluated various novel P01 groups derived from amides, carbamates and ureas (Table 1). Introduction of benzamide at P01 resulted in compound 12 that demonstrated a Ki = 52.0 lM (Table 1). Replacement of benzamide moiety with acetamide group resulted in compound 13 with Ki = 22 lM, a marginal improvement in potency compared to 12. However, introduction of cyclopropyl amide resulted in compound 14 with improved binding Ki = 3.0 lM and EC90 = 15.0 lM. Similarly, incorporation of a phenethyl amide at P01 resulted in compound 15 with much improved binding Ki = 0.72 lM and EC90 = 3.5 lM. This was our first compound in this series to demonstrate a binding less than 1 lM. We next explored the incorporation of carbamates and ureas at this position. Synthesis of the tert-butyl carbamate analog resulted in compound 16 with Ki = 3.1 lM and EC90 = 24.0 lM whereas introduction of tert-butyl urea resulted in compound 17 with Ki = 1.6 lM. Since the urea analogs demonstrated partially better binding than carbamates, we further explored SAR of the ureas analogs by synthesizing cyclohexyl, cyclopropyl and phenyl urea derivatives. The cyclohexyl urea analog 18 demonstrated a Ki = 1.3 lM with an EC90 = 16 lM whereas the cyclopropyl analog demonstrated a binding activity Ki = 0.75 lM and EC90 = 6.0 lM. The phenyl urea analog 20 had a Ki = 0.95 lM a similar activity as cyclopropyl derivative 19 but demonstrated a better cellular activity (EC90 = 2.4 lM). A close analysis of Table 1 showed that the phenethyl amide derivative 15 and phenyl urea analog 20 were the more active compounds with enzyme binding less than 1 lM. To further improve binding in this series we decided to evaluate the SAR by incorporating a-methylbenzyl urea present in 2 (Table 2). This was also observed as the desirable group in identification of 2. Concomitant to this modification we evaluated the effect of modification of the P1, P3 and P3-capping groups. Introduction of amethylbenzyl urea had a profound effect on the binding activity of these inhibitors. a-methylbenzyl urea analog with bicyclic imide cap and P1 cyclopropylmethyl group resulted in compound 21 with Ki = 0.25 lM and EC90 = 1.1 lM. Replacement of bicyclic P3 cap with dimethylcyclohexylimide cap resulted in compound 22 with Ki = 0.20 lM similar in activity to compound 21 and five fold improvement in activity compared to phenylurea 20.

We next evaluated the effect of modification of the P3 group and its capping. Incorporation of methylsulfonamide derived cap with n-propyl P1 residue resulted in compound 23 with Ki = 0.11 lM and EC90 = 0.7 lM; a 10-fold improvement in binding compared to 20. This was the first compound with sub micro-molar cellular activity in this series of inhibitors. Introduction of pyridylsulfonamide derived P3 cap with P3 cyclohexyl glycine and P1 propyl residue resulted in compound 24 with Ki = 0.23 lM a two fold loss in binding compared to methylsulfonamide derivative 23. Compound containing, dimethylglutarimide P3-cap, P1 propyl group, P01 a-methylbenzyl urea resulted in inhibitor 25 with much improved binding (Ki = 0.064 lM) and EC90 = 0.3 lM. This was an aza-peptide analog with an EC90 comparable to our first generation clinical candidate 1. Analog 25 was evaluated for its selectivity against human neutrophil elastase a structural homologous enzyme to HCV NS3 protease. The selectivity was determined to be Ki(HNE)/Ki(HCV) = 960. Incorporation of bicyclic imide derived P3 cap with P1 propyl group and P01 a-methylbenzyl urea resulted in compound 26 with a binding of Ki = 0.032 lM and EC90 = 0.25 lM. This compound was more potent in binding and replicon cellular activity than the dimethylcyclohexylimide analog 25. It was also slightly more active than our first generation compound 1.

In conclusion we have identified a series of novel aza-peptide derived series of HCV NS3 protease inhibitors that demonstrated excellent binding and cellular activity. This provides a possible avenue for depetidization of peptidic analogs of our first generation compound 1. By truncation of P6 --P01 derived inhibitors we have identified a series of novel imide P3-capped aza-peptide analogs that demonstrated excellent inhibition of HCV NS3 protease. SAR investigation of P01 identified a phenethyl amide analog 15 and phenylurea derivative 20 which demonstrated submicro-molar enzyme binding activity and moderate cellular activities. Further modification of P01 P3 and P3-capping residue resulted in identification of potent analogs such as 25 (Ki = 0.064 lM; EC90 = 0.30 lM) and 26 (Ki = 0.032 lM; EC90 = 0.25 lM) that contained imide P3 capping and a-methylbenzyl urea P01 and a propyl P1 groups. These inhibitors are similar in potency to our first generation clinical candidate Sch 503034, but desirably lack the electrophilic trap and epimerizable ketoamide center. In addition the urea carbonyl moiety is non-electrophilic and serine does not make a covalent bond with the inhibitor. References and notes
