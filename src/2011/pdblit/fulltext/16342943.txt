ABSTRACT: Dialkylsilanediols have been found to be an effective functional group for the design of activesite-directed protease inhibitors, including aspartic (HIV protease) and metallo (ACE and thermolysin) proteases. The use of silanediols is predicated on its resemblance to the hydrated carbonyl transition-state structure of amide hydrolysis. This concept has been tested by replacing the presumed tetrahedral carbon of a thermolysin substrate with a silanediol group, resulting in an inhibitor with an inhibition constant Ki ) 40 nM. The structure of the silanediol bound to the active site of thermolysin was found to have a conformation very similar to that of a corresponding phosphonamidate inhibitor (Ki ) 10 nM). In both cases, a single oxygen is within bonding distance to the active-site zinc ion, mimicking the presumed tetrahedral transition state. There are binding differences that appear to be related to the presence or absence of protons on the oxygens attached to the silicon or phosphorus. This is the first crystal structure of an organosilane bound to the active site of a protease.

The design of metalloprotease inhibitors for adaption as new pharmaceuticals has become commonplace (1-5). Structurally novel enzyme inhibitors have also led to a deeper understanding of enzymatic action and ligand-receptor interaction (4, 5). Inhibitors of the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme were the first protease inhibitors to become commercially successful drugs (6), and many other metalloproteases are potential or actual pharmaceutical targets (7, 8). Thermolysin was one of the first metalloproteases to have its structure solved crystallographically (9), revealing an active-site zinc ion that activates the scissile amide bond (1, Figure 1) toward the attack by water (2), and stabilizes the resulting tetrahedral intermediate (10). At the center of the metalloprotease inhibitor design is selection of a functional group that will interact with the metal. Thiols 4 have an intrinsic affinity for zinc and have been commonly deployed in this capacity (4, 5, 11). Ketones (hydrated as in 5) have been found to be useful metalloprotease inhibitors (12), and the strong chelation of zinc by hydroxamic acids 6 has given

rise to potent inhibitors (13). Anionic groups, such as carboxylates 7 and phosphinates 8, in which the charge provides a Coulombic attraction to the zinc cation, are found in many successful inhibitors (4, 5). Silanediols 9 are recently introduced mimics of the unstable hydrated carbonyl 2, employing a central silicon atom, the element most similar to carbon. Silanediol-based protease inhibitors have been prepared by substitution of the silanediol into a known inhibitor in three instances: replacing the alcohol in 10b to give an HIV protease inhibitor 10a (Figure 2) (14), replacing a ketone in 11b to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme with 11a (1517), and replacing a phosphinic acid in 12b for inhibition of thermolysin with 12a (18, 19). Thermolysin inhibitors 12a-d employ the second row elements silicon and phosphorus, which are of similar size, to create the zinc-binding moiety. For the silanediol 12a, the oxygen (Y) of phosphorus acids

12b-d was replaced with a methylene group, a consequence of the strongly acidic conditions used to prepare the silanediol (20). The replacement of a Cbz (benzyloxycarbonyl) group (Y ) O, 12b-d) with a dihydrocinnamoyl group (Y ) CH2, 12a) was expected to be of little consequence, because that oxygen has no significant interaction with the enzyme. While the advantages of using a phosphorus anion (12bd, at pH > 4) for the interaction with the active-site zinc cation are obvious, the use of these phosphorus groups as pharmaceutical agents requires their delivery in the form of an uncharged ester prodrug that must be hydrolyzed in ViVo (21). The neutrality of a silanediol group could allow its use without protection or activation. Silanediols 11a and 12a are both low nanomolar inhibitors of metalloproteases, yet dialkylsilanediols are not well-known for their abilities to bind metals. A cyclic siloxane surrounding a potassium ion has been reported (22), and structures of zinc ions chelated by silicates have been published (23). Trialkylsilanols have also been promoted as transition-metal ligands (24, 25). To more fully investigate how a silanediol group interacts with the active site of a metalloprotease, the silanediol 12a was crystallized with thermolysin. Phosphinic acid 12b has been discussed by Bartlett et al. (26) and Grobelsky et al. (27). Here, we describe the crystal structure of the silanediol 12a bound to thermolysin and compare this to complexes between the thermolysin and phosphonamidate 12c [PDB ID 5TMN (28)] and phosphonate 12d [PDB ID 6TMN (29)]. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Inhibitor/Enzyme Preparation and Crystallization. The silanediol was prepared as previously reported (19). Thermolysin from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus was purchased from Calbiochem and stored at -20 °C. Hexagonal crystals (space group, P6122) were grown using vapor diffusion with sitting drops based on the procedure described by Hausrath et al. (30). Briefly, the protein was dissolved at 100 mg/mL in 50 mM MES at pH 6.0 and 45% (v/v) DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). With a well solution of 30% (w/v) ammonium

sulfate, sitting drops of 10 µL of protein and 10 µL of buffer (50 mM MES at pH 6.0, 45% (v/v) DMSO, and 1.0 M NaCl) were then prepared. After the crystals grew for several days, they were transferred in one step to a solution of 25 mM MES at pH 6.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, and 5% (v/v) DMSO. The crystals were then soaked for 3 days in the above buffer with 50 µM silanediol added. Crystallography. After the crystal with bound ligand was mounted in a glass capillary tube, diffraction data were collected using a Rigaku rotating anode X-ray source and R-Axis IV image plate detector. A total of 50 images were recorded, each with an exposure time of 15 min during a 1.0° oscillation. The images were processed with Mosflm (31), and the data were reduced with Scala (32). Refinement was carried out with TNT (33) against a working set of 18 553 reflections, with a random test set of 1015 reflections (or about 5%) excluded from the refinement process for cross-validation (34). Using a native thermolysin structure (PDB ID 8TLN) as a starting model, an initial Fosilanediol Fonative electron-density map was ambiguous, in part because of the presence of a dipeptide in the active site in the native structure (35). For refinement, to decouple the test set and working set, all solvent molecules and ligand atoms were removed from the starting model, the B factors were set to the Wilson B factor (16.4) and a random coordinate shift was applied to all atoms such that the rms shift was 1.0 Å (33, 34). Some refinement was then done using rigid-body refinement of the whole molecule followed by individual atom positional refinement using conjugate direction minimization of a least-squares target function (33). The binding mode for the silanediol could then be discerned from a Fosilanediol - Fcomit electron-density map. The ligand was built into this map; solvent molecules were added; and the structure was further refined with several rounds of map

Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 1Y3G). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The structure of the thermolysin/silanediol complex is well-refined with acceptable geometry and excellent agreement with the diffraction data (Table 1). The silanediol inhibitor 12a binds with the tetrahedral silicon center mimicking the proposed transition state for peptide hydrolysis, with the zinc ion interacting with both silicon hydroxyls (Figures 2 and 3). Glu 143, which is thought to help activate the attacking water molecule, interacts preferentially with one of the silicon oxygens (Figure 3). Additionally, a DMSO molecule is seen binding next to and interacting with the inhibitor. Overall, the silanediol inhibitor 12a binds similarly to the phosphonamidate 12c and phosphonate 12d (Figure 4). There are some differences, which increase as one moves along

a The contact distances between the hydrogen donor and acceptor for all potential hydrogen bonds made by the silanediol or the phosphonamidate inhibitor to the enzyme or solvent are listed. Hydrogen bonds were determined with HBPLUS (44) using a 3.2 Å donoracceptor cutoff from the coordinates for the complexes between the thermolysin and silanediol (PDB ID 1Y3G) and the thermolysin and phosphonamidate (PDB ID 5TMN). Non-hydrogen-bonding interaction distances were calculated with EdPDB (45). Bold interaction distances indicate that the contact satisfies HBPLUS hydrogen-bonding requirements. Regular-type interaction distances indicate that the contact does not satisfy hydrogen-bonding requirements, either because of incorrect angles or incompatible donor and acceptor. We show these regulartype distances for comparison purposes. b Inhibitor atoms are listed by the inhibitor residue number (e.g., I1-I4, corresponding to Figure 4) and atom name. In most cases, the inhibitors contact the same atoms in both structures.

the inhibitor from its C-terminal leucine to its N-terminal Cbz group. The C-terminal residues are positioned essentially the same relative to the enzyme. The silane group is shifted somewhat from the phosphate group, and the N-terminal benzyl group is repositioned substantially. There are three principal binding differences, and these can be rationalized on the basis of the structural differences between the inhibitors (Table 2 and Figure 4). Phosphorus and silicon have slightly different covalent radii (1.06 Å for phosphorus and 1.11 Å for silicon), as well as differences in their intrinsic bond angles (38). With the silanediol

FIGURE 4: Wall-eyed stereoview showing the binding detail, comparing the silanediol 12a (white carbons) to the phosphonamidate 12c (gray carbons). The amino acids or amino acid analogues comprising the inhibitors are labeled I1-I4. The atoms labeled X, Y, and Z are identical to those in Figure 2. Some key potential hydrogen bonds that are discussed in the text are indicated with dashed lines. The phosphonate 12d (not shown) binds essentially identically to the phosphonamidate 12c (maximum difference of 0.2 Å) (29). The figure was prepared with MOLSCRIPT (36).

Silanediol Thermolysin Inhibitor Structure inhibitor 12a, the silicon atom has hydroxyl substituents, while the phosphorus of the phosphonamidate 12c has oxyanion substituents. This accounts for two of the observed differences. First, His 231 shifts about 0.3 Å closer to one of the silicon hydroxyls compared to its distance from the equivalent phosphorus oxygen (Table 2). Histidine 231 is considered to make a critical interaction between the enzyme and the hydrated transition state (39, 40), and the close interaction with the silicon hydroxyl reflects the outstanding hydrogen bonding associated with silanols (41, 42). Second, a DMSO molecule has a close interaction (2.6 Å) between its oxygen and the other hydroxyl of the silanediol (Figure 3), suggesting that the DMSO oxygen, which should have no attached hydrogens, is accepting a hydrogen bond from the silanol. This would not be possible with the phosphonamidate oxygen, and no DMSO was observed at this site in the phosphonamidate complex. The second structural difference between the inhibitors is that the silanediol 12a has a carbon (Z, Figure 2) attached to the silicon (X), whereas there is a nitrogen bonded to the phosphorus of the phosphonamidate 12c and an oxygen in the case of the phosphonate 12d (Figure 2). This carbon (Z) precludes formation of the hydrogen bond between the backbone carbonyl of Ala 113 and the nitrogen of 12c, which leaves the Ala 113 backbone carbonyl free to interact with the backbone amide of the N-terminal inhibitor residue of 12a. This altered role for Ala 113 appears to cause a 0.5 Å enzyme shift in the region of Ala 113-Phe 114, one of the largest shifts in the active site (Figure 4). In terms of the inhibitor, this interaction, in combination with steric interactions with the DMSO, appears to make the benzyl group favor the alternative conformation seen in the silanediol complex. While the phosphonate 12d is similar to the silanediol 12a in that it cannot make a hydrogen bond between (Z) and the Ala 113 carbonyl, its benzyl group remains in the conformation of the phosphonamidate 12c. This suggests that a combination of factors and not just the absence of a single hydrogen bond results in the alternative benzyl conformation seen in the silanediol 12a. The third structural difference between the inhibitors occurs at site Y, where the carbon of the silanediol 12a is replaced with the oxygen of the phosphonamidate 12c. With the phosphonamidate, this oxygen atom is 3.3 Å from a water molecule. Such an interaction might be unfavorable with the carbon of the silanediol, which would also make the benzyl residue favor its alternative conformation. Given that the conformational differences in both enzyme and inhibitor are easily explained by the structural differences between the inhibitors, the implications for future inhibitor design are good. With this work, the possibility of using silicon to create nonhydrolyzable tetrahedral centers for inhibitors and other ligands has now been realized. The structures suggests that silanediols will bind as one would predict; therefore, they can now be used with confidence as structural motifs for drug design. In summary, we report here the first structure of an organosilane bound to a natural receptor where the silicon interacts with the binding site (43). In this case, the ligand binds very similarly to phosphorus-based ligands used in previous studies, with some differences associated with the chemical and structural differences between the respective molecules. The similarities in binding for the phosphorus-

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 50, 2005 16527 and silicon-based inhibitors, both in terms of Ki and modes of binding, might seem surprising based on the neutrality of the silanediol and the anionic nature of the phosphorus groups and their interaction with the cationic zinc ion. Nevertheless, the use of silanediols as rational components for drug design is now on firmer footing. REFERENCES
