New insight into the catalytic mechanism of chorismate mutases from structural studies
Chorismate mutase catalyzes the rearrangement of chorismic acid to prephenic acid, which is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. Its catalytic mechanism has been much studied, but is poorly understood. Recent structural information on enzymes from two species, and on an antibody that catalyzes the same reaction, has shed new light on this topic.

Chorismic acid is the key branch point intermediate in the +kimate pathway of bacteria. fLungi, and higher plants [I ]. It can be converted either into prephenic acid, evmtually leading to tyrosine and phenylalanine, or into mtliranildte. eventually producing tryptophan. The intramolecular rearrangement of chorismic acid to prephenic acid (Fig. 1) is catalyzed by chorismate mutate. Thi\ enzyme accelerates the reaction some two millionfold, yet. despite its central role in the aromatic biosyw thetic pathway. the enzyme's catalytic mechanism relnains poorly underctood [3,3]. Recent structural studies on sweral naturally occuring chorismate mutases [4-h], and on m mtibody that catalyzes the same reaction 171, mav now have provided some insight into the catalytic nlcchanisnx used by these proteins. Interdisciplinary studies on chorismate mutax by chenusts, biochemists and enzymologists have taken many forn~s.The kinetics of the reaction have been investigated using wlvcnt, substituent, and isotope effects [3.8-131; protein modific,xtion has been used to identie key amino-acid residues [ 14-l 61, and several competitive inhibitors and alternative substrates have been synthesized

[I 7-211. As well as these approaches, the mzyme has been studied by NMK and infrared spectroscopy [Y-Z], and theoretical calculations have been used to propose models for the transition state involved in rexrangement [3,29-331. Genetic, immunological, and evolutionary analyws [33-3.53 have also provided information on the characteristics of the eiizyiiie. Efforts to mimic the catalytic mechanism of chorimlate mutase have ranged from the design of cimple cryptandc (crypt-like, bridged cro\vn ethers) [36] to the production of monoclonal antibodies generated against a putative transition-state analog 137,38].Two groups have ,lchieved antibod~-ill~di~lt~[~ catalysis of the rearrangement of (-)-chorismic acid: antibody 1 F7 [7.30,40] gave a rate enhancemrnt of 2JO-fold, while antibody 1 1Fl -2E1 1 [-I I ] gave a 1O'-fold rate enhancement.

IF7 171 were obtained in complex with the inhibitor Fhown as compound 3 in Fig. 1. Most recently, we have 0 been able to determine the 2.2 A resolution X-ray structure of the monofunctional amino-terminal chorismate mutase domain (E&M) engineered from the bifunctional E.&ric/~io m/i enzyme chorismate niutaseprephenate dehydratase (P- protein) 1431 in complex with inhibitor 3. Comparison of the three structurec allows an informed evaluation of the various mechanistic hypotheses which have been advanced for chorismate nlutase catalysis. Both the B. mbrilis and the E. c-o/i mutases appear to exploit electrostatic and hydrogen bonding effects in an unusual fashion to achieve catalysis.
The f. co/i chorismate mutase

EcCM consists of residues l-l 09 of the P-protein. It has three helical segments (residues h-42, 39-65, 70-l 00) mhich cause the peptide backbone to adopt a shape like the figure 1. Coiled-coil and helix-helix interactions between the two longest segments create a catalytically functional, elongated honmdimrr with two equivalent, elbo\v-shaped active sites that are highly charged and completely enclosed. Although access to the active site is possible from different directions, as might be expected in the parent bifuuctional enzyme, charged Arg, Asp and Glu side-chain residues on different faces of the protein shield the catalytic region from solvent (Fig. 2).
The B. subfilis enzyme

the kinetic parameters of EcCM and BsCM are similar, both the amino-acid sequence and the secondary structure of BsCM are strikingly different. Standard alignment methods indicate less than 20 "/;I similarity in the EcCM and BsCM sequences (indeed, there is very little sequence similarity between any of the known mutases from different organisms). The high-resolution crystal structure of BsCM in complex with compound 3 [4,5] shows that the peptide backbone ofBsCM adopts a fivestranded mixed P-sheet containing one a-helix (residues 1X-34) and a two-turn 3,,, helix. BsCM is a symmetric trinler packed to form a pseudo-&P-barrel, with adj,cent subunits forming three equivalent clefts that constitute the active sites. In striking contrast to EcCM, the active site in BsCM is open and accessible to solvent, and the protein itself makes no important contacts with the Cl 0 carboxyl group of the inhibitor (Fig. 3).

The three-dimensional structure of the monoclonal 1 catalytic antibody 1 F7 has been determined to 3.0 A resolution as the Fab'-inhibitor complex 1401. Ligand binding occurs at the confluence of six loops made up of heavy (Hl-H3) and light (Ll-L3) chain variable domains. The active site displays a bowl-like shape or cleft, and interacts with compound 3 using a combination of electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic effects (Fig. 4). As with most antibodies to small molecules, ligand cornplernentarity resides mainly on the heavy chain; only a single residue of the light chain (Tyr-L94) interacts with compound 3.The active site of

thus resembles those of E&M and BsCM in that active sites of these enzymes are also dimeric, and contacts again consist mainly of contributions from monomer chain.

The rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate is a one substrate-one product process, and is one of very few chemical transformations where the enzymatic process can be compared directly with its unimolecular solution counterpart.The uncatalyzed rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate occurs about 10" times faster than the rearrangement of ally1 vinyl ether [20,43], and for this reason has attracted considerable interest. It seems reasonable that an understanding of the intrinsically fast rearrangement of chorismate might shed light on, or provide clues about, the nature and role of substl-ate and transition-state binding interactions in the mutase process. Both the enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions proceed via chair-conformation transition structures [ 10.1 1 1. Secondary tritium isotope effects on the uncatalyzed rearrangement are evident at C.5 (C-O bondbreakage), but not at CY (C-C bond formation) [9]. No comparable i\otopc effect is seen in the mutase-catatyzed rearrangement, although a small (k,/k, = 0.96) inverse secondary isotope effect is observed by tritiation at CJ- [ 121. Judging from activation parameters for a variety of catalysts (Table I), and assuming that activation parameters for EcCM and BsCM resemble the other nati\:e enzymes sl~own in Table 1, the ability of

mutases to restrict conformational degrees of freedom is important in promoting rearrangement. In the case of 1 F7, however, the activation parameters suggest that the antibody's modest rate acceleration results from a reduction in AH* for the reaction 1391 rather than from entropic control. Substrate conformation How does chorismate mutase achieve the experimentally observed enhancement in the rate of chorismate rearrangement? Several possible ways have been suggested. Since the entropy of activation is reduced effectively to zero in the catalyzed process (Table l), the enzyme-substrate complex must orient the ring of the substrate in the pseudo-diaxial conformation, while rotation about C5-07 and U-07 must be severely restricted to lock the enol pyruvate side chain in the rearranging chair conformer. As lo-20 % of chorismate exists as the pseudo-diaxial form in dynamic equilibrium

with the pseudo-diequatorial form, Knowles and colleagues [25] have suggested that the enzyme binds the diaxial conformer, and that the enzyme-substrate complex then undergoes rearrangement via some intermediate from which product formation is rapid. The inverse secondary tritium kinetic isotope effect at C4 noted earlier is thus rationalized in terms of the effect of tritium on the conformational equilibrium of chorismate (T prefers to be equatorial; thus, k,,/kT = 0.95). Enzyme-substrate binding The functional groups of chorismate offer several possibilities for noncovalent binding in the enzyme-substrate complex (see Fig. 1). For example, the two charged carboxylate groups are capable of strong electrostatic interactions with protonated active-site residues. Suitable partners may also form H-bonds with chorismatei carboxy1 and hydroxyl groups. Inhibition studies with both aliphatic and aromatic diacids indicate that the vinyl ether oxygen is important [21,24], and that hydrophobic forces may contribute to binding [2]. Finally, there is the possibility of r-electron interactions with chorismate's diene system [ 21. There have been a number of attempts to observe the enzynie-substrate complex and other ligand interactions directly using 13C-NMK [26,27]. Although neither free nor bound chorismate can be detected, difference spectra reveal significant perturbations between C5 and C6 in bound prephenate, perhaps caused by changes in electron

density and/or molecular geometry in that region 127,281. In support of the role of electrostatic interactions, studies using synthetic analogs and esters of chorismate indicate that the only functional groups required on the ally1 vinyl ether framework in chorismate for mutase-catalyzed rearrangement are the two carboxylic acid groups 1231. The X-ray crystal structures of EcCM and BsCM provide useful information on enzyme-substrate complex formation. When the two active sites are compared by superimposing the atoms of the bound inhibitor, conpound 3, a common motif emerges in the highly charged region created by the presence of adjacent, protonated residues (Lys30, Argl 1' and Arg5 I in EcCM; Arg90 and Arg7 in &CM). This electropositive wall interacts strongly with the left flank (Cl-C4) of chorismate through an elaborate network of bridging H-bonds involving both 07 and the Cl 1 carboxylate of the en01 pyruvate (Figs 2b, 3b). In retrospect, an early clue to this concentration of positive charge came from the work of Gorisch, who concluded from inhibition of the Stvc~pronl)~ccs auvr~ficieur~ mutase by small inorganic anions that at least two cationic groups were present in the active site 121. Working with E. roli chorismate mutaseprephenate dehydratase (the source of EcCM), Gething and Davidson [ 151 further noted the singular importance of a lysine residue (almost certainly Lys3'3; Fig. 2b) whose modification led to complete loss of mutase activity without affecting the dehydratase domain.

Mechanism Conformational trapping Besides promoting enzyme-substrate complex formation through electrostatic effects, the positively charged residues in the EcCM active site are strategically arranged to orient and lock chorismate in the requisite chair conformer for rearrangement.We propose that free chorismate may enter the active site in extended conformation, shown as structure 4 in Figure 5, which minimizes electrostatic and n-n repulsive interactions. Initial contact between the enol pyruvate carboxylate and Lys39 forms an electrostatic bond. Clockwise rotation about CS-07 enables the side-chain carboxylate group to form a second H-bond to Argl l', as shown in structure 5. Further clockwise rotation forms the highly stabilized guanidine-carboqlate pairing shown in structure 6, together with a third H-bond between 04 and Lys39, ef&ctively freezing the rotation of the carboxylate group about U-Cl 1 and suspending the enol ether n-system over the carbocyclic ring, approximately parallel to an axis defined by C2-C4. An incremental rotation about C.5-07 forms a fourth H-bond between 03 and the bound water molecule bridging Argll' and tightly ArgS 1. With its structure gradually made more compact through favorable H-bonding and electrostatic effects, chorismate ic thus drawn deeper into the active site as the rearranging conformation is achieved in the enzynie-substrate complex. At the same time, an electron lone pair on 07 becomes accessible for H-bonding to Lyc39 and GlnXri of EcCM (. see structure 7; this will be discussed further below). Comparable entropic restriction of chorismate by &CM could also result from similar interactions between the Cl 1 carbosylate of chorismate (see Fig. 1) and Arg90, Arg7 and Tyr108, which bring 07 into proximity with Asp48 and Glu52. Antibody 1 F7, however, contains only a single cationic residue (Arg-HS)S).The X-ray structure of 1 F7 Lvith bound compound 3 indicates just two Hbonds to the C 11 carboxylate, and no side-chain residues are within H-bonding distance of 07. Instead of acting like an entropy trap, this protein displays an unfavorable decrease in ASP (Table 1). What is the role of the Cl0 carboxylate ion in substrate binding? It has been shown that the E. mli enzyme will not catalyze the rearrangement of dimethyl chorismate, C I O-monomethyl or Cl I -monomethyl chorismate 1231. This absolute requirement of EcCM for both of the carboxylic acid groups of chorismate is perhaps not surprising in view of the additional H-bonding interactions of between Arg2X and SerX4 and the Cl0 carboxylate conlpound 3 (Fig. 2b). In contrast, HsCM forms no active site contacts with the ring carboxyl group of the substrate, and it is not known whether this enzyme can promote the rearrangement of Cl 1 -monomethyl chorismate. Given the quite similar steady-state kinetic profiles of &CM (k,,, = 50 s-l; K, = 100 FM) [43] and EcCM (Ic~,,~ = 72 SC', K, = 290 PM) [4S] and their comparable behavior 1%.ith inhibitor 3 (K1 = 3 FM for &CM; K, = 2 PM for EcCM) (H.B.

Rotation around the C5-07 bond then allows formation of a second hydrogen bond; 04 replaces 03 in the hydrogen bond to Lys39, while 03 moves to hydrogen-bond to Argl 1' (structure 5). Further rotation around the C5-07 bond moves 03 to yet another position (structure 6) and increases the number of hydrogen bonds formed to three. Rotation is highlighted by the shaded rectangle, whose long axis lies along the 07~C8 bond. Once the rotation is complete, a lone pair of electrons becomes accessible for hydrogen bonding to Lys39 and Gln88 (structure 7). At this point, the substrate is essentially frozen in a conformation close to that of the transition state. E-S complex, enzyme-substrate complex.

According to this hypothesis, a torque is exerted on chorismate's ally1 vinyl ether system, forcing Cl and C9 closer together to facilitate rearrangement. Despite their elegance and simplicity, both of these hypotheses are invalidated by the fact that the Cl 0 carboxylate in BsCM, insofar as can be determined from the X-ray structural data (Fig. 3), makes no significant bonding contacts with the enzyme [4,5]. Knowles and colleagues considered a mechanism in which anchimeric assistance by chorismate's C4 hydroxyl might result in transient formation of an oxirinium ion 1121. This mechanism cannot, however, explain the catalyzed rearrangement of 4-deoxychorismate and chorismate methyl ether mentioned earlier 1231. A rateenhancing solvolysis of the C4-hydroxyl group, based on known substituent effects in pericyclic processes 143,461, is also excluded by the viability of +deoxychorismate as a mutase substrate (k,,, 21 s-`; k,., for chorismate = 51 s-1) [12,23]. A nucleophile-assisted, dissociative pathway for chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase mediated rearrangement has also been considered 1121. This hypothesis relies on the fact, first noted almost forty years ago by Goering and Jacobson 1471 and independently by White et al. [4X], that some Claisen rearrangements are more rapid in polar solvents.These processes are currently thought to involve dipolar or dissociated transition states [20,49], although Gajewski and colleagues [50,51] have argued that the magnitude of the observed solvent effect is substantially weaker than would be expected if bond heterolysis were important. As depicted in structure 8 (Fig. 6), the enzyme-substrate complex could undergo rate-limiting, heterolytic cleavage of the ether bond with general acid catalysis. Concomitant attack by an enzyme nucleophile leads to the covalently bound intermediate 9 which then forms

data) it seems probable that the two enzymes have similar mechanisms; this would imply that the Cl0 carboxylate has a relatively minor role in substrate binding for both enzymes. Complexes of EcCM or BsCM with substrate may also derive additional noncovalent stabilization from the formation of two H-bonds with the C4 allylic alcohol (05). In EcCM, 05 has one H-bond each with Asp48 and with the y-carboxyl of Glu52 (Fig. 2). Comparable H-bonds are seen with Glu78 and Cys75' in BsCM (Fig. 3). The importance of these interactions in enzyme-substrate complexation is not clear. In the case of the E. di bifunctional enzyme chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydrogenase (the T-protein: a second mutase similar to the P-protein), the C4 hydroxyl of chorismate is apparently not essential for substrate binding, since both 4-deoxychorismate and chorismate methyl ether are substrates for mutase-catalyzed rearrangement 1231. Comparable tests with these substrates using BsCM have not been reported. However, indirect evidence from studies on the E. c&Tprotein suggest that Cys75' in BsCM is important in binding chorismate. Of the four cysteines identified in the T-protein, alkylation of one with iodoacetamide results in complete loss of mutase activity [16]. Since only one cysteine (Cys96) is found in the amino-terminal (i.e. mutase) domain of the T-protein, that residue may have a role comparable to that of Cys75' in BsCM. Similar modification studies on the E. coli P-protein (from which EcCM originates) indicate that none of the four cysteines in the structure is directly involved in mutase activity 1161. The catalytic mechanism Historically, most mechanistic hypotheses about chorismate mutase have considered both carboxylic acid groups in the substrate to be important. Gorisch [2] proposed that chorismate binds the enzyme through ionic interactions at both carboxylates, with the requisite diaxial conformation gaining further stabilization from H-bonding. Alternatively, the enzyme-substrate

The product could then be formed by expelling the nucleophile in an S,2' process.

observed solvent effects [50,51], this hydrogen-bonding effect suggests how chorismate mutases might reduce AH~. In the case of EcCM, formation of the enzyme-substrate complex 7 (Fig. 5) rotates the lone pairs on 07 of chorismate into position for H-bonding with Lys39 and Gln88. By disrupting n-r* conjugation in the conformationally constrained vinyl ether, Hbonding by these residues would raise the free enerW of the enzyme-substrate complex and reduce the activation enthalpy for rearrangement. The specific hydrogen bonds formed would depend on the detailed structure of the enzyme-substrate complex. If bound chorismate is conformationally constrained without H-bonding at 07, then two new H-bonds with Lys39 and GlnXX created in the transition state will significantly accelerate the rearrangement of chorismate. For AS* to remain zero, however, a corresponding number of H-bonds must be broken elsewhere in the rearrangement transition structure. Alternatively, some H-bonding to 07 already present in the EcCM enzyme-substrate complex may become more pronounced as the rearrangement proceeds, with a compensatory weakening in H-bonding elsewhere in the transition state, most likely in the Cl 1-carboxyl group as the enol pyruvate side chain migrates to Cl. In the case of BsCM, 07 may likewise form two hydrogen bonds with ArgW to promote the pericyclic rearrangement, while maintaining ASS - 0 by forfeiting hydrogen bonds elsewhere in the active site. In antibody 1 F7, however, there are no residues proximal to 07 that are capable of forming even one H-bond to the vinyl ether moiety (Fig. 1). Thus we propose that (i) adjacent, protonated, active site residues exert conformational control in the chorismate mutase enzyme-substrate complex, and (ii) hydrogen bonding between active site residues and 07 of bound chorismate catalyzes the rearrangement step. Both mechanistic hypotheses are consistent with all available experimental data on the chorismate mutase reaction, and are amenable to experimental tests on several fronts. These hypotheses also suggest what to look for in the modest sequence similarities found to date in known mutases. One may further expect that antibody 1 lFl-2Ell (which enhances rearrangement by 104) will display one or more of the key elements that are found in the enzyme structures when the solid-state structure of this protein is elucidated. Future possibilities Striking differences between the shallow, exposed active site of BsCM and the enclosed, but more spacious, active site of EcCM suggest the possibility of designing speciesspecific mutase inhibitors. More interestingly, these findings suggest that with proper placement of charged groups in the substrate, new enzymes may be engineered to promote a wide range of pericyclic rearrangements based on similar catalytic motifs.

product by expelling the nucleophile in an S,3' process. The observation of a significant D,O solvent isotope effect for the T protein (>2 on both kcnr and kcd,/K,) is consistent with a general acid-proton transfer in the rate-limiting step.
III the case of BsCM, however, no 11,O solvent isotope effect is observed, and the enzymatic reaction is insensitive to acid or base [2h]. Although mechanistic deductions based on solvent isotope effects are risky, the fact that no significant change in kc,,/K, is evident between pH 5-C) with BsCM argues against the participation of an ionizable nucleophilic group, including Cys75'. Gray and Knowles [2X] conclude from kinetic and spectroscopic parameters that the mutase reaction is an encounter-controlled pericyclic process, although perhaps asynchronous like its uncatalyzed counterpart. The enzymatic rearrangement is thought to be accelerated by selective binding of the reactive pseudodiaxial chair conformer, with some rate enhancement possible as a result of electrostatic stabilization of the transition state [as].

Hydrogen bonding X-rav crystallographic studies on EcCM and BsCM inhiditor complexes reveal another common structural motif which may be responsible for the lower AN of the catalyzed reaction. Each enzyme forms two H-bonds with 07 of the bound inhibitor (Figs 2b, 3b). In a recent Monte Carlo simulation of the effect of hydration on Claisen rearrangements, Severance and Jorgensen 1521 show that the transition state for ally1 vinyl ether rearrangement in water is better hydrated than the reactant.The authors suggest that enhanced hydration, that is, increased H-bonding in water, may account for a several hundredfold rate enhancement over the Claisen rearrangement of ally1 vinyl ether in the gas phase. By disrupting the well known II-T* conjugation in vinyl ether\ IS-?], H-bonding would raise the energy of the reactant and reduce the activation enthalpy for rearrangement (Fig. 7). Thus, two effects might explain the observed acceleration of Claisen rearrangements in polar solvents: (i) stabilization of a heterolytic transition state through solvent-promoted dissociation, and/or (ii) destabilization of the reactant through hydrogen bonding with water or alcohols. Besides accommodating the concerns of Gajewski and colleagues over the magnitude of the

202

It is also possible that understanding how chorismate mutase catalyzes its rearrangement may allow the development of rational approaches to the next generation of mutase inhibitors. Such inhibitors could be important leads for new antibiotics and herbicides. The shikimate pathway is the effective site of action of such successful drugs as trimethoprim (an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase) and the sulfa antibiotics (p-aminobenzoate mimics which disrupt folate biosynthesis). Chorismate mutase inhibitors could join the ranks of these therapeutic agents, either as stand-alone drugs or as part of a dualblockade strategy for antibiotic chemotherapy. In either case, mutase inhibitors represent a form of treatment against which no resistance mechanisms have yet emerged. Arknowledgements: This
