Abstract Translesion synthesis is an important cellular mechanism to overcome replication blockage by DNA damage. To copy damaged DNA templates during replication, specialized DNA polymerases are required. Translesion synthesis can be error-free or error-prone. From E. coli to humans, error-prone translesion synthesis constitutes a major mechanism of DNA damage-induced mutagenesis. As a response to DNA damage during replication, translesion synthesis contributes to cell survival and induced mutagenesis. During 1999­2000, the UmuC superfamily had emerged, which consists of the following prototypic members: the E. coli UmuC, the E. coli DinB, the yeast Rad30, the human RAD30B, and the yeast Rev1. The corresponding biochemical activities are DNA polymerases V, IV, , , and dCMP transferase, respectively. Recent studies of the UmuC superfamily are summarized and evidence is presented suggesting that this family of DNA polymerases is involved in translesion DNA synthesis. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction DNA is frequently damaged by endogenous and environmental agents. DNA lesions can be removed by base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair. However, some DNA lesions often persist in the genome during replication, especially under circumstances such as (a) when cells sustain significant DNA damage; (b) when a particular damage is poorly repaired; (c) when some genomic regions are inefficiently repaired; or (d) when DNA damage occurs during the S phase of cell growth. Since many lesions block replicative DNA polymerases, these unrepaired lesions pose a serious problem for the cell. Without completion of DNA replication, the cell would die. In

response, cells have evolved a sophisticated damage tolerance system to enable replication of the damaged DNA templates. Translesion synthesis represents one of the damage tolerance mechanisms. Translesion synthesis requires a specialized DNA polymerase (Pol) to copy the damaged DNA template. In 1989, Morrison et al. [1] recognized that the REV3 gene product of the yeast S. cerevisiae is probably a translesion synthesis polymerase. Seven years later, Nelson et al. [2] found that the yeast Rev1 dCMP transferase is additionally involved in translesion synthesis of apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. During 1999­2000, five specialized DNA polymerases were discovered in an explosive manner, the E. coli polymerases IV and V and the eukaryotic Pol , Pol , and Pol . All these five DNA polymerases and Rev1 share conserved protein sequence motifs. Thus, the UmuC superfamily of proteins had emerged. Meanwhile,

biochemical studies of the UmuC family of DNA polymerases also yielded explosive information, which points them to translesion synthesis. The turn of the 21st century was indeed a turning point for the field of translesion synthesis. In this review, recent studies of the UmuC superfamily are summarized and evidence is presented suggesting that this is a family of translesion synthesis polymerases.

2. Translesion synthesis: error-free versus error-prone Based on the outcome, translesion synthesis can be divided into two categories: error-free and errorprone. The former is also referred to as accurate translesion synthesis and the latter as mutagenic translesion synthesis. Error-free translesion synthesis predominantly incorporates the correct nucleotide opposite the damage, whereas error-prone translesion synthesis frequently incorporates an incorrect nucleotide opposite the damage. Consequently, error-free translesion synthesis is a mutation-avoiding mechanism, whereas error-prone translesion synthesis is a mutation-generating mechanism. When an incorrect nucleotide is preferentially incorporated opposite the damage and is subsequently extended, a clear case of error-prone translesion synthesis is demonstrated. However, if the correct nucleotide or an incorrect nucleotide is incorporated by a DNA polymerase with similar probability, the subsequent extension step becomes important in determining the likelihood of mutation opposite the lesion. In this case, if the extension step does not drastically favor the correct nucleotide opposite the lesion, error-prone consequence of the translesion synthesis is predicted. In some cases, the distinction between error-free and error-prone translesion synthesis may not be obvious based on in vitro biochemical experiments and may require genetic analysis to determine the in vivo consequence of lesion bypass by the DNA polymerase.

3. The UmuC superfamily of proteins UmuC is an indispensable component of the SOS mutagenesis, also called the UmuDC mutagenesis pathway, in E. coli. This is the major mechanism of

DNA damage-induced mutagenesis in E. coli and is under the control of the SOS response. DNA damaging agents can switch on the SOS response, which induces the expression of 30 genes including umuC, umuD, and dinB [3,4]. After autocleavage to remove the N-terminal 24 amino acids, UmuD protein is converted to the active form UmuD , which in turn interacts with the UmuC protein, forming a tight complex UmuD2 C [4]. In 1999, it was demonstrated that the UmuD2 C complex is DNA polymerase V and catalyzes error-prone translesion synthesis during SOS mutagenesis [5,6]. UmuC is the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase V [6]. Studies on DNA damage-induced mutagenesis in the yeast S. cerevisiae led to the cloning of several genes including REV1, REV3, and REV7 [1,7,8]. Larimer et al. [7] recognized that Rev1 protein shares some homology with the E. coli UmuC protein. Based on homology to the E. coli DinB protein, a yeast gene was cloned whose inactivation led to cellular sensitivity to UV-radiation [9,10]. Thus, this gene was named RAD30 [9,10]. Searching Rad30 homologues in humans identified three genes. One RAD30 homologue turned out to be the XPV gene [11,12]. The second gene was named RAD30B [13]. The third gene is more related to the E. coli dinB and was therefore named DINB1 [14,15]. Then, it became clear that a group of proteins related to the E. coli UmuC and DinB has evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans, and this group is now referred to as the UmuC superfamily [13,16]. The prototypic members of the UmuC superfamily were originally considered as the E. coli UmuC, the E. coli DinB, the yeast Rev1, and the yeast Rad30 [13,16]. However, based on most recent studies (discussed in Section 6), the human RAD30B protein is more appropriately separated out as an independent prototypic member of the UmuC superfamily (Fig. 1). The human REV1 gene has also been cloned [17,18], and is shown to be a DNA template-dependent dCMP transferase [17]. In a search for the biochemical activity of the yeast Rad30 protein, Johnson et al. [19] surprisingly discovered that this protein is a DNA polymerase (Pol ) capable of efficient error-free lesion bypass of a cis-syn TT dimer, a major UV-induced DNA lesion. In parallel, Masutani et al. [20] discovered that their purified xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) protein is a DNA polymerase capable of efficient

error-free lesion bypass of a cis-syn TT dimer. Shortly after, the human XPV was shown to be the yeast Pol counterpart [11,12]. Following these exciting discoveries, the human RAR30B and DINB1 proteins were soon found to be DNA polymerases and were named as Pol and Pol , respectively [21­27]. The E. coli DinB turned out to be DNA polymerase IV [28]. Hence, except Rev1 as a dCMP transferase, the rest members of the UmuC superfamily form a new class of DNA polymerases. S. cerevisiae dose not have Pol and a human DINB1 homologue. Recently, the eighth S. cerevisiae DNA polymerase was identified as the TRF4 gene product and was named Pol [29]. This polymerase is involved in sister chromatid cohesion [29], but it is not related to the human Pol encoded by the DINB1 gene. By searching the genome sequencing database, a human DINB1 homologue was found in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

4. DNA polymerases IV and V The dinB gene coding for DNA polymerase IV plays an important role in the untargeted mutagenesis in E. coli [30,31]. Untargeted mutagenesis refers to induced mutations that arise in undamaged regions of DNA. Normally, untargeted mutagenesis in E. coli is induced by DNA damaging agents that switch on the SOS regulon. However, artificially overexpressing the dinB gene in E. coli is sufficient to trigger untargeted mutagenesis in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, resulting in mostly -1 deletions [31]. Thus, it has been

proposed that DNA polymerase IV may somehow act on the replicative polymerase III to decrease its fidelity [31]. Since dinB gene is inducible in response to DNA damage, the involvement of DNA polymerase IV in translesion synthesis is a likely possibility. Indeed, recent genetic analysis of E. coli by Napolitano et al. [32] suggests that DNA polymerase IV is involved in both error-free and -1 frameshift translesion syntheses of benzo[a]pyrene-damaged DNA. Genetic and biochemical studies have unequivocally established that DNA polymerase V is a translesion synthesis polymerase. In vitro, DNA polymerase V is able to bypass a cis-syn TT dimer, a TT (6-4) photoproduct, and an AP site [6,33]. Translesion synthesis is highly stimulated by RecA, and SSB [6,33]. Additionally, it was reported that the subunit (processivity clamp) and the subunit (clamp loader) of polymerase III holoenzyme are also required for efficient translesion synthesis [33]. Purified DNA polymerase V preferentially incorporates a G opposite the 3 T of a TT (6-4) photoproduct, and an A opposite an AP site [6,33]. Such incorporation specificity of DNA polymerase V agrees well with the in vivo mutation spectrum of the corresponding lesion, indicating that the UmuDC mutagenesis pathway is indeed the major mechanism for generating targeted mutations at sites of TT (6-4) photoproduct and AP lesions. In light of the recent indications that DNA polymerases II and IV participate in bypass of certain DNA lesions [32], it is important to examine the in vitro response of DNA polymerase V to other types of DNA damage. Purified DNA polymerase V is much less accurate than the replicative polymerase III in copying

62

undamaged DNA templates [33,34]. This property may provide the basis for a role of DNA polymerase V in untargeted mutagenesis [34]. It is critical that DNA polymerases IV and V are under control of the SOS response [3,4]. DNA polymerase V is further controlled post-translationally through the cleavage of UmuD [4]. Without control, the untargeted mutagenesis activities of DNA polymerases IV and V would seriously compromise the genomic stability of E. coli under normal growth conditions.

5. DNA polymerase Pol is very efficient in error-free lesion bypass of a cis-syn TT dimer [19,20]. Kinetic analysis of purified human Pol showed that nucleotide incorporation opposite a cis-syn TT dimer is as efficient as that opposite the undamaged TT sequence [35]. Once it was established that the human XPV gene codes for Pol [11,12], the phenotype of the human hereditary disease XPV became immediately understandable at the molecular level. XPV patients show sensitivity to the sunlight and a predisposition to skin cancer [36]. Consistent with the clinical phenotype, XPV cells are sensitive to killing by UV-radiation and are hypermutable following UV-radiation [36­38]. These cellular characteristics of XPV are predicted by the loss of the error-free translesion synthesis activity of Pol . Based on these genetic studies of XPV cells and biochemical characterizations of Pol , it is unequivocally established that Pol is a translesion synthesis polymerase. Detailed analysis of mutation spectrum revealed that XPV cells show a high proportion of C  A transversions at cytosine-containing photoproducts [38]. Thus, it is likely that Pol also performs error-free translesion synthesis opposite cytosine-containing cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD). Supporting this expectation, Yu et al. [39] observed that mutations at a CC and a TC sequence were elevated in yeast cells without Pol . However, this study did not determine whether Pol is involved in error-free bypass of CPDs or (6-4) photoproducts [39]. Therefore, definitive prove of error-free bypass of C-containing CPDs will await for biochemical studies of Pol in response to these lesions in vitro. Originally, it was believed that Pol is an error-free translesion synthesis polymerase specific to

UV-radiation. However, Yuan et al. [40] demonstrated that purified yeast Pol is also capable of error-free nucleotide incorporation opposite an AAF-adducted guanine (AAF-G). This result was later confirmed with purified human Pol [41] (Zhang, Wang, unpublished results). Consistent with these biochemical results, Cordonnier et al. [42] reported that translesion synthesis of AAF adducts in XPV cell-free extracts is deficient. Vaisman et al. [43] reported that human Pol can accurately bypass a cisplatin or an oxaliplatin adduct at the GG sequence. However, Masutani et al. [41] reported that while the correct C is preferentially incorporated opposite the 3 G of the cisplatin adduct, A insertion is favored by human Pol opposite the 5 G of the lesion. Discrepancies between these two studies may reflect differences of the sequence context surrounding the lesion. Short wave UV-radiation also produces another class of major DNA lesions, the (6-4) photoproducts [3]. In contrast to a TT dimer, a TT (6-4) photoproduct cannot be bypassed by Pol [20,44]. However, this polymerase is able to effectively incorporate a G opposite the 3 T of the TT (6-4) photoproduct before aborting DNA synthesis [44]. This result is consistent with the in vivo mutagenic property of a TT (6-4) photoproduct in mammalian cells in that major mutations occur as G misincorporation opposite the 3 T of the lesion [45]. Whether Pol contributes to G misincorporation opposite the 3 T of a TT (6-4) photoproduct in vivo remains to be vigorously examined by genetic experiments. 8-Oxoguanine is a major form of oxidative damage in DNA and represents a miscoding lesion that base-pairs with C or A [46]. The probability of C versus A insertion opposite 8-oxoguanine varies widely with different DNA polymerases [46]. Regardless of C or A incorporation opposite the lesion, further DNA synthesis is efficiently carried our by many polymerases tested [46], including Pol and human Pol [44,47]. Yeast Pol preferentially incorporates C opposite 8-oxoguanine [40], whereas human Pol incorporates C or A opposite the lesion with similar efficiencies [44]. Even slight changes, presumably, in the active sites of yeast and human Pol could significantly alter the coding specificity of 8-oxoguanine in DNA. Extension of A from opposite 8-oxoguanine by human Pol to the next template base is only 1.7-fold slower than extension from C opposite the lesion

Z. Wang / Mutation Research 486 (2001) 59­70

63

[44]. Thus, bypass of 8-oxoguanine by human Pol is error-prone and is expected to result in frequent G  T transversions. An AP site in DNA is non-instructional, since it can be derived from A, T, C, or G. Thus, any polymerase that can perform translesion synthesis opposite an AP site will be error-prone. In vitro, yeast Pol incorporates a G and less frequently an A opposite a template AP site [40]. Human Pol , on the other hand, prefers A incorporation than G opposite an AP site [41,44]. Nucleotide incorporation opposite an AP site is not significantly affected by the template base 5 to the lesion [44]. However, significant -1 deletion (50% of bypassed products) was observed with human Pol when the template base 5 to the AP site is a T, probably as the result of misaligning the primer terminal A with the next template T by the polymerase [44]. Human Pol also effectively catalyzed translesion synthesis opposite a template (+)-trans-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-N2 -dG adduct in an error-prone manner, predominantly incorporating an A, less frequently a T, and least frequently a G or a C [44]. This specificity of nucleotide incorporation would result predominant G  T transversions, less frequent G  A transitions, and even less frequent G  C transversions. The (+)-trans-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-N2 -dG bulky adduct is the major lesion formed in cells after exposure to the strong carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene, and it is highly mutagenic as tested in the monkey COS cells [48,49]. Remarkably, the specificity of nucleotide incorporation by human Pol correlates well with the mutagenic specificity of this lesion in COS cells [48,49]. Such an agreement between the in vitro and the in vivo results suggest a role for Pol in mutagenic bypass of the (+)-trans-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-N2 -dG lesion in mammalian cells.

6. DNA polymerase Human Pol is a very unique DNA polymerase. It is the only known DNA polymerase from any biological source that violates the Watson­Crick base-pairing rule opposite the template T [21­23]. Depending on the sequence context, human Pol incorporates G opposite the template T at 3­10-fold higher rates than A [21­23]. Opposite the template C, misincorpora-

tions by human Pol also occur at unprecedented rates [21­23]. Furthermore, human Pol is catalytically very inefficient opposite a template C or T [21,23]. Zhang et al. [21] noticed that following predominant G incorporation opposite the template T, the resulting T­G base-pair is less efficiently extended by human Pol compared to the Watson­Crick base-pairs. Consequently, DNA synthesis by human Pol frequently aborts opposite the template T, a property designated as the T stop [21]. This T stop and low catalysis opposite template pyrimidines restrict human Pol to a very short stretch of DNA synthesis. These unique features suggest that Pol may play a specialized function. Wang and Woodgate laboratories proposed that such a specialized function may be the somatic hypermutation during immunoglobulin development [21,22]. Somatic hypermutation involves the enormous mutation rates of 10-3 to 10-4 per base-pair per generation in rearranged heavy and light chain variable regions of antibody-coding genes [50]. It is widely believed that an error-prone DNA polymerase is responsible for generating this extreme mutation rate, about 106 -fold higher than that in other genes in mammalian cells. However, the identity of this hypermutation DNA polymerase has been elusive so far. The biochemical requirements for a hypermutation DNA polymerase could be satisfied by Pol [21,22]. Responses of human Pol to several DNA lesions have been examined in vitro. Surprisingly, this polymerase incorporates one nucleotide opposite a template AP site more efficiently than opposite a template T [21]. The nucleotide incorporated opposite the AP site follows the order from most frequent to most infrequent: G > T > A > C [23,47]. Following one nucleotide incorporation opposite the AP site, further DNA synthesis is aborted, regardless of the sequence context 5 to the lesion [23,47]. In response to 8-oxoguanine in DNA, human Pol predominantly incorporates C opposite the lesion [47]. Since 8-oxoguanine is a miscoding lesion [46], it is surprising that human Pol is significantly blocked right before this lesion [47]. Hence, the inability of 8-oxoguanine to block a DNA polymerase is not universally true. Human Pol is able to incorporate the correct C opposite the bulky AAF-G [47]. However, further DNA synthesis is blocked by the lesion [47].

64

In response to a template TT (6-4) photoproduct, human Pol prefers A incorporation opposite the 3 T of the lesion [23,47,51]. This is remarkable considering the fact that G was much preferred by this polymerase opposite the undamaged template T [21­23]. Again, after incorporating one nucleotide opposite the 3 T of the TT (6-4) photoproduct, further DNA synthesis was blocked by the lesion [21,23]. In drastic contrast to Pol , human Pol is largely unresponsive to a cis-syn TT dimer in DNA [21,23]. Zhang et al. [47] observed that even very limited nucleotide incorporation (mainly T) opposite the 3 T of the cis-syn TT dimer requires large excess of human Pol and prolonged reaction time. T insertion by human Pol opposite the 3 T of the TT dimer was also observed by Tissier et al. [51]. Two hallmarks distinctly separate human Pol and Pol apart: (a) efficient error-free bypass of the cis-syn TT dimer by Pol ; and (b) preferential incorporation of G opposite the undamaged template T by human Pol . Additionally, the C-terminal region of human Pol is quite different from that of Pol [52]. Therefore, it is more appropriate to separate human Pol out as a prototypic member of the UmuC superfamily (Fig. 1).

7. DNA polymerase Translesion synthesis activity of purified human Pol has been examined in vitro using several DNA lesions. Purified human Pol is unable to perform translesion synthesis opposite either a cis-syn TT dimer or a TT (6-4) photoproduct [25,27]. In contrast, 8-oxoguanine is efficiently bypassed by this polymerase in an error-prone manner, preferring A incorporation opposite the lesion [25]. Human Pol most frequently incorporates A opposite a template AP site [25,27]. However, efficient further extension from opposite the AP site requires T as the next template base, and is mediated mainly by a -1 deletion mechanism [25,27]. Thus, following A incorporation opposite the AP site, human Pol probably misaligns the primer terminal A with the next template T, looping out the template AP site during subsequent DNA synthesis [25,27]. Supporting this model, when the template base 5 to the AP site is substituted with A, C, or G, primer extension by human Pol is largely stopped

after incorporating one nucleotide opposite the AP site [25,27]. Furthermore, with an A, C, or G template base 5 to the AP site, lesion bypass is significantly less efficient and is achieved mainly by a mechanism of A insertion followed by extension without deletion [25,27]. This dramatic effect of sequence context 5 to the AP site on translesion synthesis is unique to Pol . Human Pol slightly favors T incorporation than C opposite an AAF-G [25­27]. Less frequently but significantly, A is also incorporated opposite the AAF-G and G incorporation occurs least frequently [25,27]. After transforming the monkey COS cells with a shuttle vector containing a site-specific AAF-guanine, Shibutani et al. [53] observed that A, T, and G were misincorporated opposite the lesion resulting in 8 G  T, 6 G  A, and 2 G  C mutations, respectively, from 156 clones analyzed. The in vitro results are in general agreement with this in vivo genetic results. Thus, Pol may contribute to AAF-induced mutagenesis in mammals. Error-free AAF bypass by Pol may account for the fact that the majority of recovered shuttle vector from COS cells did not contain mutations opposite the lesion [53]. The (-)-trans-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-N2 -dG is one of the bulky adducts formed by cellular exposure to benzo[a]pyrene. Human Pol efficiently bypassed this lesion in vitro in an error-free manner by incorporating C opposite the lesion [25]. This observation suggests that Pol may play an important role in suppressing benzo[a]pyrene-induced mutagenesis in humans [25]. Supporting this conclusion, Napolitano et al. [32] found recently that DNA polymerase IV (Pol homologue) participates in error-free bypass of a benzo[a]pyrene DNA adduct in E. coli cells.

8. The Rev1 dCMP transferase In yeast, a major error-prone translesion synthesis mechanism is the Pol mutagenesis pathway. In this pathway, several genes have been cloned, including RAD6, RAD18, REV1, REV3, and REV7 [1,7,8,54­56]. Rad6 is a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme [57] and forms a complex with Rad18 [58]. Rad18 is a zinc finger protein and possesses ATPase activity and single-stranded DNA binding activity [58,59]. The Rad6­Rad18 complex is thought to function at an early step of the Pol mutagenesis pathway

[58]. In 1996, Nelson et al. [2] reported a crucial finding that yeast Rev1 is a dCMP (deoxycytidyl) transferase, which can efficiently insert a C opposite a template AP site. Rev1 activity opposite additional DNA lesions remains to be determined. Elucidation of Rev1 as a dCMP transferase has served as an important prelude to the discovery of Pol 3 years later [19]. Rev3 protein is the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase (Pol ) [60]. Rev7 strongly interacts with Rev3 and stimulates the Rev3 polymerase activity. Hence, Rev7 is considered a subunit of DNA Pol [60]. DNA Pol and Rev1 are thought to be involved in the translesion DNA synthesis step in the Pol mutagenesis pathway [2,60]. Most recently, Huang et al. [61] found that the Pol32 subunit of yeast Pol , a replication polymerase, is involved in the Pol mutagenesis pathway. Most likely, additional genes in this mutagenesis pathway remain to be identified. It has been shown in yeast that the vast majority of mutations induced by UV-radiation, acetylaminofluorene, and AP sites are generated by the Pol mutagenesis pathway [1,62­66]. Furthermore, it appears that significant amounts of spontaneous mutations are also generated by the Pol mutagenesis pathway [63,67]. Therefore, the Pol pathway is thought to function as a major and general mechanism of DNA damage-induced mutagenesis. However, even in this

simple eukaryotic model organism, much of the Pol mutagenesis mechanism remains unknown. Nevertheless, impressive progresses have been made in recent years. Based on our current knowledge, a hypothetical model of the Pol pathway in eukaryotes is shown in Fig. 2. In humans, two RAD6 homologues, HHR6A and HHR6B, have been identified [68]. Recently, the human RAD18, REV1, REV3 and REV7 genes have been cloned [17,18,69­73]. The human REV3 gene product is predicted to be a DNA polymerase [71,72] and it interacts with the human REV7 protein [73]. Lin et al. [17] demonstrated that human REV1 protein is also a dCMP transferase. Human RAD18 strongly interacts with HHR6A and HHR6B [69,70]. Human cells with reduced RAD18 show sensitivity to several DNA damaging agents, including UV-radiation [70]. Furthermore, Gibbs et al. [18,72] showed that UV-induced mutagenesis in cultured human cells requires the REV1 and REV3 genes. These molecular, biochemical, and genetic studies clearly show that the Pol mutagenesis pathway is also operational in humans. Ubiquitous expression of RAD18, REV1, and REV3 genes in various human tissues is consistent with the notion that the Pol pathway may also be a major mutagenesis (error-prone translesion synthesis) mechanism in mammals [17,69,71].

9. Copying damaged DNA templates: why multiple polymerases It is apparent that the UmuC superfamily is a group of specialized enzymes for translesion DNA synthesis. While some lesions such as AP sites and AAF-adducted guanines may be responded to by multiple polymerases, other lesions such as TT dimers may require a specific polymerase for translesion synthesis. Functional redundancy would empower the cell an enhanced efficiency for translesion synthesis during DNA replication. More importantly, it is perhaps the functional specificity that underscores the importance of evolving multiple DNA polymerases for translesion synthesis. Missing even one translesion synthesis polymerase may be sufficient to trigger health problems in humans, such as the case of the XPV disease in which Pol activity is lost [11,12]. It is important to note that very efficient lesion bypass by a DNA polymerase, such as Pol response to a TT dimer, is a rare exception for translesion synthesis. The majority of DNA lesions tested inhibits the DNA polymerase activity to varying degrees. Conceptually, low efficiency of translesion synthesis would not be a serious problem for cells. While replication polymerases need to be extremely efficient such that up to billions of base-pairs must be accurately copied in minutes to hours, translesion synthesis polymerases may have minutes to hours to just copy a few base-pairs from the damaged DNA template, a much lower efficiency compared to replication, but efficient enough to get the job done like repair proteins. It has been observed that translesion synthesis of several DNA damage by polymerase V is highly stimulated by accessory proteins in E. coli [6,33]. Thus, it is possible that some translesion synthesis may also be stimulated by accessory proteins in eukaryotes. The presence of multiple translesion synthesis polymerases raises the possibility that some lesion bypass may involve coordinated actions of two polymerases. This is probably needed when a polymerase incorporates one nucleotide opposite the lesion but cannot effectively continue DNA synthesis further, such as the case of Pol response to an AP site in DNA [40,41,44]. Indeed, Yuan et al. [40] found that while yeast Pol and Pol cannot bypass a template AP site individually under the conditions used, the combined activities of both polymerases lead to AP

site bypass following one nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion by Pol . Thus, one important role for Pol in translesion synthesis may be its activity to extend DNA primers from opposite some lesions that strongly inhibit other polymerases. This notion of sequential actions by two polymerases in lesion bypass was later adopted by Johnson et al. [23] to show that human Pol and yeast Pol together can bypass a template AP site and a TT (6-4) photoproduct in vitro. More biochemical and genetic studies are needed to test the two-polymerase two-step hypothesis of Yuan et al. [40].

10. A mechanistic model of translesion synthesis To understand how the UmuC family of DNA polymerases is able to copy damaged DNA templates, a loose-and-flexible active site model has emerged from several laboratories [25,74,75]. Lesion bypass polymerases may have evolved to contain a loose-andflexible pocket at its active site. Undamaged template would fit the pocket loosely without the stringent geometry constraints for highly accurate Watson­Crick base-pairings, resulting in extraordinarily low fidelity DNA synthesis. The loose pocket of these polymerases, however, would be able to fit some damaged templates, leading to nucleotide incorporation opposite the lesion. Since translesion synthesis polymerases respond to many lesions differently, the loose pocket of each polymerase likely retains certain specificity as to what lesions can fit into it. Supporting the loose active site model, DNA synthesis fidelity of E. coli DNA polymerase V is much lower than the replication polymerase III on undamaged template [6,33]. In eukaryotes, Pol , Pol , and Pol are all associated with extraordinarily low fidelity of DNA synthesis when copying undamaged DNA templates [21­23,35,74,76,77]. Apparently, these specialized polymerases are excluded from normal DNA replication in order to maintain a genomic stability. At least three factors can be considered that may largely confine these polymerases to sites of DNA damage. First, expression of these polymerases may be controlled to a low level under normal growth conditions. Indeed, the E. coli DNA polymerases IV and V are controlled by the SOS response system [3,4], and the yeast Pol expression is induced upon

cellular exposure to DNA damaging agents [9,10]. Secondly, access of the polymerase to DNA template may be limited to sites of DNA lesions during replication by a recruitment mechanism, about which nothing is known at present time. Thirdly, DNA synthesis by these polymerases are generally distributive, i.e. only one or a few nucleotides are synthesized before the polymerase dissociates from the template. The result is very short patches of translesion DNA synthesis, thus, limiting the contribution of these polymerases from synthesizing DNA far away from the lesion.

mains to be learned about these translesion synthesis polymerases. Nevertheless, we have made giant steps in the field of translesion synthesis, which promise more exciting discoveries in the years to come. Given the possibility of targeting damage-induced mutagenesis for cancer prevention and therapy, the potential for benefiting human health from translesion synthesis research is enormous.

11. Biological significance of translesion synthesis Translesion synthesis is an important cellular response to DNA damage during replication. The biological significance of translesion synthesis is of two-fold: (a) enhancing cellular resistance to the killing effect of DNA damaging agents; and (b) providing mutations. While the benefit of (a) to an individual life is obvious, benefit of (b) is perhaps even more important when considered in the context of a species. Mutations empower the cell to evolve and adapt, especially under genotoxic stress conditions. Many mutations may be harmful for an individual, such as those that cause hereditary human diseases and cancer. However, mutations are building blocks for evolution and adaptation, which help a species to survive and subsequently proliferate in a changing environment. The UmuC superfamily is biochemically capable of translesion synthesis in response to damaged DNA templates, as demonstrated by in vitro studies summarized in this review. Whether Pol and Pol in eukaryotes also play important roles in lesion bypass in vivo remains a challenge to the field of translesion synthesis. Genetic experiments are indispensable in order to fully understand the biology of these polymerases including the REV1 dCMP transferase. Mutant cells or mutant transgenic animals are valuable resources for these genetic experiments. Efforts in constructing transgenic mice with Pol or Pol knockout are underway in several laboratories and these studies are eagerly awaited. Knocking out Pol in mice, however, unexpectedly lead to embryonic lethality [78­80], which underscores how much re-
