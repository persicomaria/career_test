An endo-xylanase (1,4-fl-D-xylanxylanohydrolase EC 3.2.1.8) was isolated from the culture filtrate of Paecilomyces varioti Bainier. The enzyme was purified 3.2 fold with a 60% yield by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The purified enzyme had a molecular weight of 25,000 with a sedimentation coefficient of 2.2 S. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was 3.9. The enzyme was obtained in crystalline form. The optimum pH range was 5.5-7.0 and the temperature, 65°C. The Michaelis constant was 2.5 mg iarchwood xylan/ml. The enzyme was found to degrade xylan by an endo mechanism producing arabinose, xylobiose, xylo- and arabinosylxyio-oligosaccharides, during the initial stages of hydrolysis. On prolonged incubation, xylotriose, arabinosylxylotriose and xylobiose were the major products with traces of xyloletraose, xyiose and arabinose.

A l t h o u g h enzymes that break down xylan have been studied for over 35 years, it is only in recent years that a number o f reports have issued from various laboratories regarding h o m o g e n o u s xylanases and the mechanisms involved in the break down o f xylan. Many microorganisms have been reported to produce extracellular xylanase (1,4fl-D-xylanxylanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.8) (1-6). Xylan degrading enzymes from mesophilic sources have been extensively studied. Relatively less i n f o r m a t i o n is available regarding xylanases o f thermophilic origin. Xylan, the most p r e d o m i n a n t hemicellulose, is a complex heteroglycan. The xylans differ in their substituents according to their origin. They could be arabinoxylans, 4 - 0 methylglucuronoxylans or arabino-4-O-methylglucuronoxylans. The present investigation was carried out to analyse the mechanism o f hydrolysis of xylan from Eleusine coracana. A xylanase was isolated from the culture filtrate of Paecilomyces varioti. Purification, characterization and the mode o f action o f the enzyme are reported in this paper.
MATERIALS AND METHODS Organism and culture conditions The thermophilic fungus P. varioti maintained on YPSS (Yeast-Starch) Agar was used. F o r p r e p a r a t i o n of the enzyme, the fungus was grown in aqueous medium containing shredded duplicating paper as the carbon source at a concentration o f 4%o. The medium was supplemented with peptone (0.25%), yeast extract (0.25O/oo) a m m o n i u m sulfate (0.4%), magnesium sulfate (0.05%), calcium chloride ( 0 . 0 1 ~ ) , potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (0.24%), dipotassium hydrogenorthophosphate (0.16°//00) and Vogel's trace elements (0.1 ml//). The shake cultures were maintained at 50°C for 14 d and then harvested by filtration through a cotton bed. The culture filtrate was used as the crude enzyme solution. Enzyme assay Xylanase activity was measured on the basis o f reducing sugar released from xylan by the enzyme, using the Somogyi (7) method. The assay mixture

consisted of 0.1 ml of 2%o larchwood xylan, 50pl o f enzyme solution and 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 5.9) made up to a final volume o f 2 ml. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 50°C. One unit of xylanase activity was defined as the a m o u n t o f enzyme which releases l p m o l o f reducing sugar per minute under the assay conditions. In the column effluents, the protein was determined by measuring the absorbance at 280nm. In the pooled sample, the protein was estimated by L o w r y ' s method (8). Purification of endo-l,4-fl-xylanase Crude enzyme in the culture filtrate was precipitated with a m m o n i u m sulfate (80%o saturation). The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation at 4 6 0 0 × g for 10rain and dissolved in distilled water. The enzyme solution was desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column and then c h r o m a t o g r a p h e d on a Sephadex G-50 column (2.5 × 4 0 c m ) equilibrated with distilled water. Elution was carried out with distilled water at a flow rate of 20 m l / h with a fraction volume of 5 ml. Fractions with xylanase activity were pooled and subjected to ion exchange c h r o m a t o g r a p h y on a D E A E - S e p h a d e x A50 column (1.5 × 50 cm) equilibrated with 0.05 M Tris-HC1 buffer (pH 7.5). Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of NaC1 from 0.1 to 0.3 M in the same buffer. The flow rate was 28 m l / h with a fraction volume of 3 ml. Fractions with xylanase activity were pooled, concentrated and r e c h r o m a t o g r a p h e d on a D E A E - S e p h a d e x A-50 column ( 1 . 5 × 3 0 c m ) equilibrated with 0 . 0 5 M acetate buffer (pH 4.8). The protein was eluted with a linear NaC1 gradient from 0.1 to 0.2 M in the same buffer. The flow rate was 30 m l / h and the fraction volume 3 ml. Fractions with xylanase activity were pooled, lyophilized, stored at 4°C and used for further studies. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Gabriel (9) using 12.6°//00 gels with Tris-glycine buffer (pH 8.3). 7 0 p g of protein were loaded on the gel and the electrophoresis was p e r f o r m e d at 160 V for 3-4 h. The protein was detected by staining the gels with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Crystallization of xylanase The enzyme was crystallized from a solution in distilled water at concentrations of 50-70 m g / m l kept at 4°C for 10-12 h.

lsoelectric focusing Isoelectric focusing was performed using polyacrylamide gels (5%, 1 m m thickness) on a P h a r m a c i a FBE 3000 apparatus. The gels were prefocused for 30 min at 30 W, 150 m A and 2000 V. Focusing was done at 3 0 W , 1 5 0 m A and 2000V for 105 min. The gels were fixed in a 10% T C A - 5 % sulfosalicylic acid mixture for one hour and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G. pI marker proteins having values 3.5-9.3 were used as references. Molecular weight determination The molecular weight o f the enzyme was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described by Weber and Osborn (10) using the following marker proteins: Bovine serum albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (43,000), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20,100) and lysozyme (13,000). The molecular weight was also determined by gel filtration on an Ultrogel AcA-54 column ( 1 . 5 × 3 5 c m ) equilibrated with 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.4). The calibration proteins used were bovine serum albumin (67,000), ovalbumin (43,000), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20,100) and lysozyme (13,000). Analytical ultracentrifugation The sedimentation coefficient of the purified protein was determined by analytical ultracentrifugation on a Beckman Prep U.V Scanner L8-70 M at 50,000 rpm and 20°C using a protein concentration o f 500-600/~g/ml. Carbohydrate content The total c a r b o h y d r a t e content o f the enzyme was determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid m e t h o d of Dubois, et al. (11), using glucose as the standard. 1.0 ml of 5%0 (w/v) phenol in water was added to the sample and incubated at r o o m temperature for 10 min. This was followed by the addition of 5 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid rapidly to ensure p r o p e r mixing. After 20 min, the colour which developed was read at 490 nm. Amino acid analysis The enzyme was hydrolyzed with 6 N HC1 at 110°C for 24 h according to the method reported by M o o r e and Stein (12). The amino acid composition o f the hydrolysate was determined by an amino acid analyzer (Model LKB-4400). T r y p t o p h a n was determined by the m e t h o d of Bencze and Schmid (13). The cysteine residues were estimated as cysteic acid by performic acid oxidation according to the method o f Hirs (14). Analysis of xylan hydrolysate Xylan was extracted from the straw o f E. coracana (15) and hydrolysed by the enzyme. The hydrolysates were analysed by paper c h r o m a t o g r a p h y on W h a t m a n no. 3 c h r o m a t o g r a p h i c paper using n-butanol : pyridine : water (6 : 4 : 3) as the solvent system. Products were detected with phthalic acidp-anisidine spray reagent (16) which gave a pink color with pentoses, green with hexoses and brown with uronic acids. The hydrolysis products were isolated by preparative paper c h r o m a t o g r a p h y . One end of the paper was stained to identify the products and the corresponding strips were

cut out and eluted with water for 3 - 4 h . The oligosaccharities thus obtained were further purified by repeated paper c h r o m a t o g r a p h y using the same solvent system mentioned above.

Determination of the degree of polymerization of oligosaccharides Total sugar in the purified oligosaccharide preparation was estimated by a modification of the orcinol method (17). To 1 ml of the sugar solution, 2 ml of a 0.2%/00 solution o f orcinol in 70%/00sulfuric acid were added. The reaction mixture was boiled for 20 rain in a water bath and the color which developed was read at 505 urn. Reducing sugar was determined by the Somogyi method (7). The ratio of the total sugar to the reducing sugar was taken as the degree o f polymerization o f the oligosaccharide. Chemicals Xylan (larchwood), which was used as the substrate for the xylanase assay, xylose and calibration proteins were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA. Sephadex G-50, D E A E Sephadex A-50 and Sephadex G-25 for c h r o m a t o g r a p h y were obtained from P h a r m a c i a Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden. Ultrogel AcA-54 for the determination of molecular weight was obtained from LKB, Sweden. The pI marker proteins and A m p h o l i n e were from P h a r m a c i a Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden. Arabinose was obtained from S . A . F Hoffman L A Roche and C o m p a n y Ltd., Switzerland. W h a t m a n no. 3 chromatographic paper was purchased from W h a t m a n Ltd., U.K. Yeast extract and peptone were from Difco Laboratories, U.S.A. Duplicating paper was obtained locally. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade.

RESULTS A N D DISCUSSION
The endo-l,4-fl-xylanase was purified from the culture filtrate of P. varioti grown in medium containing duplicating paper as carbon source. The results are summarized in Table 1, indicating a 3.2 fold purification with a yield of 60%. The specific activity of the final preparation was 490 u n i t s / m g protein. The purity o f the final preparation was checked by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at p H 8.3. A single band of protein was observed as shown in Fig. 1. P. varioti produces a single xylanase in contrast to Aspergillus niger (2) which produces several xylanases. Purified as well as crude enzyme solutions (desalted a m m o n i u m sulfate precipitate, 50-70 m g / m l ) in distilled water led to the formation o f well defined crystals when stored at 4°C for 10-12h (Fig. 2). A yield of 25%0 was obtained from crude enzyme preparations. The crystals were insoluble in distilled water and were therefore dissolved in 50 m M phosphate buffer, p H 6.4. The specific activity of the crystals was found to be 4 8 5 u n i t s / r a g protein. However, the crystals were associated with colour and

further c h r o m a t o g r a p h y using ion exchange gels was necessary to remove the color. Other xylanases which have been obtained in the crystalline form are from Bacillus subtilis (18) and Trichoderma viride (19). The molecular weight o f the enzyme was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as well as gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA-54. It was estimated to be 25,000 by S D S - P A G E and 33,000 by gel filtration. These results indicate that the xylanase from P. varioti is a monomeric

enzyme. The molecular weights of several xylanases have been reported, ranging from 20,000 to 30,000 (1, 20, 21). Xylanases of high molecular weight are also known to exist. The xylanases from Talaromyces byssochlarnydoides YH-50 have molecular weights ranging from 45,00070,000 (22). The sedimentation coefficient, Sw. 2o of the protein determined by analytical ultracentrifugation, was found to be 2.2× 10 ~3s. The sedimentation pattern recorded at regular time intervals indicated that the protein sediments as a single homogenous species. The amino acid composition of the enzyme is shown in Table 2. The enzyme was found to be rich in aspartic acid and glycine similar to other xylanases (3, 20, 23). It was found to contain substantial amounts o f tyrosine. Methionine residues were absent. Xylanase from A. niger (24) has been reported to be p o o r in methionine while xylanase from Humicola lanuginosa lacks methionine residues (20). The enzyme was found to be a glycoprotein with a total c a r b o h y d r a t e content o f 4.5%o. Xylanases from several sources have been reported to be glycoproteins (1, 2, 22). The isoelectric point o f the enzyme was 3.9 (Fig. 3). The pI values of many xylanases have been reported. A majority o f the xylanases are acidic with pl values ranging from 3.9-4.6 (1). However, neutral ( p I = 7 . 0 ) (25) and alkaline ( p i - - 8 . 5 , 8.3) (21) D-xylanases do exist. The conditions optimal for enzyme activity were studied. The reaction was carried out at various temperatures from 32 to 80°C for 30min. The optimal temperature for enzyme activity was 65°C. Many xylanases which are optimally active at high temperatures have been reported (4, 5, 21). The thermal stability was checked by determining the residual activity after incubation at various temperatures between 50-80°C for 60 rain. The enzyme was found to be stable up to 60°C. At 70°C, the residual activity of the enzyme after 60 min was 65%o and at 80°C, the enzyme was completely inactivated by 40 rain. The optimum p H for enzyme activity was checked at various pHs from 4.0 to 8.5. M a x i m u m activity was obtained between p H 5.5-7.0. The enzyme was found to

be stable over a wide range of pH from 3-10. o-Xylanases of fungal origin have been reported to be active over a wide range of p H and tend to be rather thermostable, being totally inactivated only at temperatures greater than 65°C (1). The Km value of xylanase for larchwood xylan was calculated from a Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot. It was found to be 2.5 m g / m l . The reported Km values of fungal D-xylanases range from 0.27-14 mg of hemicellulose/ml (1). However, these values are dependent on the detailed structure of the hemicellulosic substrates. The substrate specificity of the enzyme was checked. The enzyme had no activity on carboxymethyl cellulose, soluble starch, p-nitrophenyl-fl-glucoside, p-nitrophenylfl-xyloside or p-nitrophenyl-a-glucoside (30 rain reaction in all cases). However, it was able to hydrolyse TABLE 3. Degree of polymerization of xylo- and arabinosylxylooligosaccharides
