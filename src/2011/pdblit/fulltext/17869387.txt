Abstract 2,3-Aziridino-g-lactones are versatile synthons for the preparation of polysubstituted a- or b-amino acids. With the intention of preparing a,a-disubstituted a- or b-amino acids, regioselective electrophilic substitution of aziridino-g-lactones at C2 was realized using two different methods. In the first, the anion was generated at C2 with LDA in the presence of the electrophilic agent. In the second method, the anion was trapped with TMS. Subsequent treatment of the C2 silylated product with a fluoride ion source regenerated the anion, which then reacted in situ with various electrophiles. Intramolecular aziridine opening of the C2 benzyl derivative prepared by the first method allowed access to a novel furan derivative, a direct precursor of an a,a-disubstituted b-amino acid.

1. Introduction Chiral non-racemic aziridine carboxylic esters are easily prepared compounds which, by virtue of their propensity to nucleophilic attack at C3 by all types of nucleophiles, allow a convenient access to a wide variety of a-amino acids.1 In order to allow preparation of more complex a-amino acids, and particularly their a-substituted versions,2 several groups have studied the possibility of generating stabilized anion species from such aziridine esters or their equivalents and reacting these with electrophiles.3 The first reported attempts in this direction were those of Seebach and co-workers.4 While treatment of aziridine esters with LDA in THF at À78  C led only to degradation or self-condensation, replacement of the carboxylate function by a thiol ester (1) allowed formation of the C2 anion under the same conditions and subsequent incorporation of substituents at this position (Fig. 1).

of the ester functionality into an oxazoline (2a) or thiazoline (2b) also allowed Florio and co-workers5 to generate the C2 lithiated species using n-butyllithium at À78  C, which could be reacted with a variety of electrophiles. Using a tert-butyl ester to minimize self-condensation and a 2-methoxy-1-phenylethyl group on the aziridine nitrogen to stabilize the anion (3), Husson and co-workers6 were able to prepare the C2 lithiated derivative with LDA in THF at À78  C. They obtained C2 substituted aziridines in reasonable yields and with generally excellent retention of configuration in contrast to results with the thiol esters. More recently, Wulff and co-workers7 described the successful lithiation/electrophilic substitution at C2 of C3-substituted N-benzhydryl protected aziridine

2-carboxylates (4) also using LDA. Interestingly, the selfcondensation product was observed only when no substituent was present at C3 (R¼H). Both retention and inversion of configuration at C2 were observed depending on the electrophile. In our laboratory, 2,3-aziridino-g-lactones (5) have been used as synthetic tools for the preparation of polysubstituted a- or b-amino acids as demonstrated by the synthesis of (e)polyoxamic acid (6),8 (2S,3S,4S )-3,4-dihydroxyglutamic acid (7),9 and APTO (8), the b-amino acid fragment of microsclerodermins C and D (Fig. 2).10 In contrast to aziridine carboxylic esters, this possibility of preparing either type of amino acid is due to a particular feature of 2,3-aziridino-g-lactones whereby they are attacked regioselectively at C2 or C3 by soft or hard nucleophiles, respectively.11

g-lactones as a first step toward the synthesis of a,a-disubstituted amino acids. Preliminary results concerning intra- and intermolecular nucleophilic ring opening of these substrates are also presented. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Preparation of 2,3-aziridino-g-lactones We have previously shown that 2,3-aziridino-g-lactones of type 5 can be conveniently prepared in three steps starting from D-ribonolactone.8,12 For the purposes of this study, the primary hydroxyl group of the latter was first selectively protected with a trityl13 or a TBDPS14 group (Scheme 1, 12a and 12b, respectively). These were treated with triflic anhydride/ pyridine at À78  C to generate the corresponding enol triflates 13a (81%) and 13b (78%). The aziridines 14a and 14b were then formed in good yields (64%) by way of a Michael-type 1,4-addition of 3,4-dimethoxybenzylamine (DMBNH2) in DMF with concomitant cyclization. As previously demonstrated,8 the DMB group can be easily replaced by an electron-withdrawing substituent in order to activate aziridine ring opening (vide infra).

By analogy with the formation of lithiated aziridine carboxylic esters and their derivatives, we decided to investigate the possibility of preparing C2 lithiated aziridino-g-lactones and their subsequent reaction with electrophiles. The resulting new a-substituted aziridine-g-lactones formed (9) can be envisaged as synthons for the preparation of a,a-disubstituted a- or b-amino acids such as 10 and 11, respectively (Fig. 3). In comparison with aziridine tert-butyl esters 3 or the C2 oxa- and thiazolines 2, the lactone function of our synthons was anticipated to be particularly sensitive to strong lithiating bases. On the other hand, the rigid nature of these substrates was expected to guarantee the configurational stability of the anion generated.

2.2. Electrophilic substitution of 2,3-aziridino-g-lactones We first investigated formation of aziridine-g-lactone anions using Husson's6 reaction conditions for the lithiation of tert-butyl aziridine-2-carboxylates (3). Thus, treatment of 14b with 2 equiv of freshly prepared LDA in THF at À78  C for 1 h followed by addition of methyl iodide and DMPU led exclusively to formation of the self-condensation product 15 (25%) accompanied by degradation products (Scheme 2). Use of a 5:1 mixture of DME and Et2O as solvent6 led, in the absence of DMPU, essentially to the same result. Hodgson and co-workers15 have shown that aziridine anions can be effectively generated using very short exposure to LTMP as base followed by addition of the electrophile. In our hands, treatment of 14b with 3 equiv of LTMP in THF for 90 s at À78  C followed by addition of methyl iodide led once more to formation of dimer 15 in 35% yield as the only

A similar observation was made by Kobayashi and coworkers16 during the course of their study of the anion derived from an a,b-epoxy-g-butyrolactone. A solution to this problem was found by generating the anion in the presence of an excess of the electrophilic agent, in their case, TMSCl, thereby trapping the anion before it can react to form the dimer. We were thus pleased to observe that addition of a solution of aziridine 14a and of excess TMSCl in THF to a solution of LDA in THF at À78  C led, after 0.5 h at room temperature, to formation of the desired C2-trimethylsilyl aziridine-g-lactone derivative 16a, obtained in 89% yield after flash chromatography. Under the same reaction conditions, the 5-O-TBDPS aziridine-g-lactone 14b furnished the analogous TMS derivative 16b in 85% yield (Scheme 3).

Using this methodology (Table 1), a variety of electrophiles could now be introduced at C2 of aziridines 14a in generally reasonable to good yields and starting material was recovered in almost all cases. Thus, while use of methyl iodide still gave no C2-alkylated product starting from 14a, the use of another alkyl halide, benzyl bromide, gave a low but reproducible yield of the expected C2 benzyl derivative 18a (25%, entry 2). In contrast, benzaldehyde gave a satisfactory yield of the addition product from 14a, isolated as the more stable tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivative 19a by treatment of the crude product with TBSOTf/ Et3N (51%, entry 3). Use of pivaldehyde as electrophile also gave a good yield of addition product 20a (66%, entry 4) while enolizable aldehydes such as isobutyraldehyde and butyraldehyde were less satisfactory (21a, 30%, and 22a, 15%, entries 5 and 6) as was trans-cinnamaldehyde (23a, 28%, entry 7). In contrast to the analogous results of Kobayashi using epoxy-g-butyrolactone substrates,16 no appreciable diastereoselectivity was observed with respect to the newly created chiral center in these products. Reaction of ketones with the aziridine anion of 14a gave more consistent results. Thus, the use of cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, and 3-pentanone afforded the expected products 24a, 25a, and 26a, respectively, in 44, 56, and 45% yields (entries 8e10). Other electrophiles such as benzenesulfonyl

The yields were calculated based on the recovery of starting material. Isolated as the silylated derivative (TBSOTf, Et3N, CH2Cl2).

fluoride and tri-n-butylstannyl chloride also provided the corresponding C2 substituted aziridine lactones 27a and 28a in good yields (62 and 55%, entries 11 and 12) while iodine gave the 2-iodo product 29a in 41% yield (entry 13). Use of the 5-O-TBDPS aziridine-g-lactone 14b as starting material in these reactions gave essentially similar results for the electrophiles tested (entries 2, 8, 10, and 12) except in the case of methyl iodide whereby the C2 methylated aziridino-g-lactone 17b could finally be isolated, albeit in low yield (10%, entry 1). The poor results with methyl iodide are probably due to its incompatibility with a strong lithiated base such as LDA.17 As demonstrated by Kobayashi and co-workers16 using epoxy-g-butyrolactones and Aggarwal and co-workers18 using simple aziridines, treatment of their C2 TMS derivatives with a fluoride ion source at room temperature or at 40  C, respectively, generates the corresponding anion, which reacts

cleanly with diverse electrophiles. Application of this technique to the TMS aziridine-g-lactones 16a and 16b, obtained in very high yields from 14a and 14b, respectively would thus present an alternative route to the C2 substituted derivatives described in Table 1. In initial experiments, a solution of the silylated aziridine 16a and excess aldehyde (benzaldehyde, propionaldehyde) in THF treated at À40  C or at À30  C with 1 equiv of TBAT (tetrabutylammonium triphenyldifluorosilicate)19 resulted only in recovery of starting material. On the other hand, when the reaction was conducted at room temperature, the product of desilylation 14a was obtained suggesting that the anion is indeed formed under these conditions but is insufficiently reactive with respect to the aldehyde. Finally, addition of a mixture of silylated aziridine 16a and benzaldehyde to a solution of TBAT in THF held at 40  C gave, after 30 min and after in situ silylation of the secondary hydroxyl group, product 19a in 51% yield (entry 3, Table 2) identical to that obtained by the previous method (entry 3, Table 1). Again, no diastereoselectivity was observed in this reaction in contrast to the results observed by Aggarwal and co-workers.18 This methodology was applied to other electrophiles in order to compare its efficiency with that of the one-step procedure

shown in Table 1. Except in the case of benzaldehyde (entry 3) the yields of C2 substituted aziridines were consistently lower using the other aldehydes (isobutyraldehyde, butyraldehyde, entries 4 and 5) and ketones (cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, 3-pentanone, entries 6e8) as electrophiles. Similarly, benzenesulfonyl fluoride and iodine gave lower yields of C2 substituted products 27a and 29a, respectively (32 and 16%, entries 9 and 11, compared to 62 and 41% via the one-step procedure). In contrast to the one-step procedure, however, neither methyl iodide, benzyl bromide nor tri-n-butylstannyl chloride gave the expected products starting from silylated aziridine 16a (entries 1, 2, and 10, respectively). This procedure thus appears to be generally less satisfactory than the direct lithiation/electrophilic substitution method. 2.3. Intra/intermolecular opening of the C2 substituted aziridino-g-lactones: preliminary results To examine the reactivity and the regioselectivity of nucleophilic ring opening of C2 substituted aziridino-g-lactones, the DMB group was first replaced by a more activating Cbz group (Scheme 4).8,20 Thus, treatment of the C2 silyl and benzyl aziridino-g-lactones 16b and 18b with DDQ in wet CH2Cl2 at room temperature for 8 h followed by reaction of the crude products with CbzCl in pyridine provided the corresponding N-Cbz aziridine derivatives 30 and 31, respectively. Treatment of compound 30 with excess thiophenol (solvent) in the presence of BF3$Et2O, conditions shown previously by us to provide high yields of aziridine ring opened products when the C2 position is unsubstituted (i.e., of type 5),11 gave in this case only the product of Cbz cleavage, compound 32. Alternatively, treatment of compound 31 with methanol and BF3$Et2O at reflux for 18 h led to degradation products with no observable formation of the desired C3 ring-opened product 33. This unexpected lack of reactivity of these C2 substituted aziridino-g-lactones may be attributed to the high steric hindrance provided by the combination of the C2 substituent and the OTBDPS group at C5. We thus proceeded to remove the latter by treating compound 31 with TBAF in THF, affording compound 34 in 68% yield (Scheme 5). Interestingly, treatment of alcohol 34

with BF3$OEt2 in CH3CN at room temperature provided bicyclic lactone 35 in 56% yield, the product of regioselective intramolecular aziridine ring opening at the more substituted carbon (C2) with concomitant inversion of configuration. The regioselectivity of attack was confirmed by a COSY experiment, which indicated a coupling between the hydrogen atom of the amine and H7. The formation of compound 35 opens the way to the preparation of potentially valuable, highly substituted, optically pure tetrahydrofuran derivatives (36) after hydrolysis of the lactone. 3. Conclusion In conclusion, we have demonstrated that regioselective substitution at C2 of 2,3-aziridino-g-lactones by a variety of electrophiles is possible using two different but complementary methodologies. The more direct method, involving LDA treatment of the aziridine substrate in the presence of the electrophile, generally presented better results than that in which the anion is first trapped by a TMS group and is afterward regenerated by fluoride ion. Attempts at intermolecular aziridine opening have so far failed, most likely for reasons of steric hindrance around both electrophilic sites. However, intramolecular aziridine opening at C2 by the 5-hydroxy group of the 2-benzyl aziridine-g-lactone 34 was successful, providing a precursor of a tetrahydrofuran derivative having three contiguous stereogenic centers. The latter (36), particularly rich in synthetic possibilities, may also be seen as an a,a-disubstituted b-amino acid. The possibility of improving the yields of lithiation/electrophilic trapping of aziridino-g-lactones by incorporating an N-substituent able to chelate the C2 anion is currently being investigated as is the use of less sterically encumbered substrates, which can facilitate intermolecular aziridine opening of the C2 substituted derivatives. 4. Experimental 4.1. General Melting points, measured in capillary tubes and recorded using a Buchi B-540 melting point apparatus, are uncorrected. ¨ Infrared spectra were recorded on a PerkineElmer Spectrum BX FT-IR spectrometer. Optical rotations were determined with a JASCO P-1010 polarimeter. Proton (1H) and carbon (13C) NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker spectrometers: AC 250 (250 MHz), Aspect 3000 (300 MHz), Avance 300 NMR or 500 NMR (300 and 500 MHz, respectively). Chemical shifts (d) are reported in parts per million (ppm) with

reference to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. NMR experiments were carried out in deuterochloroform (CDCl3) or in deuterobenzene (C6D6). The following abbreviations are used for the multiplicities: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet for proton spectra. Coupling constants (J ) are reported in hertz (Hz). Mass spectra were obtained either with an AEI MS-9 instrument using electron spray (ESI-MS) or with a MALDI-TOF instrument for high resolution mass spectra (HREIMS). Thin-layer chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 plates with a fluorescent indicator and visualized under a UVP Mineralight UVGL-58 lamp (254 nm) and with a 7% solution of phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol. Flash chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 (40e63 mm, 230e400 mesh ASTM) at medium pressure (200 mbar). All solvents were distilled and stored ° over 4 A molecular sieves before use. Benzaldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, butyraldehyde, cyclopentanone, and cyclohexanone ° were dried over CaSO4, distilled and stored over 4 A molecular sieves before use. Et3N and pyridine were dried over so° dium metal, distilled and stored over 4 A molecular sieves. All reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers unless otherwise stated. Organic extracts were, in general, dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) or sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). Elemental analyses were performed at the ICSN, CNRS, Gif-sur-Yvette, France. 4.2.

After 30 min of stirring at 0  C, the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for an additional 30 min. The reaction solution was diluted with EtOAc (35 mL) and water (35 mL).

After 30 min of stirring, a solution of the aziridine 14a (100 mg, 0.19 mmol) and of the electrophile (0.57 mmol) in THF (3 mL) was added to the LDA solution via cannula. The final concentration of the aziridine was 0.032 M. The color of the reaction turned to transparent brown. The reaction mixture was then gradually allowed to reach room temperature under constant stirring. After 2 h, the reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl and washed successively with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2Â2 mL) and then with saturated aqueous NaCl (2Â2 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The resulting crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using a gradient of EtOAc/heptane. This method was also used for aziridine 14b utilizing reagents of same molarity. 4.9.2. General method B To a solution of TBAT (92 mg, 0.17 mmol) in THF (1 mL) at 40  C was added a solution of aziridine 14a (100 mg, 0.17 mmol) and of the electrophile (0.51 mmol) in THF (3 mL) via cannula. After 30 min of stirring, the reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl and washed successively with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2Â2 mL) and then saturated aqueous NaCl (2Â2 mL).
