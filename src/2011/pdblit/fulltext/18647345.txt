The cold-active protein tyrosine phosphatase found in psychrophilic Shewanella species exhibits high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures as well as low thermostability, both of which are characteristics shared by many coldactive enzymes. The structure of cold-active protein tyrosine phosphatase is notable for the presence of three hydrophobic sites (termed the CA, Zn-1 and Zn-2 sites) behind the loop structures comprising the catalytic region. To identify the structural components responsible for specific enzyme characteristics, we determined the structure of wild-type cold-active protein ° tyrosine phosphatase at high resolution (1.1 A) and measured the catalytic efficiencies of enzymes containing mutations in the three hydrophobic sites. The bulkiness of the amino acid side chains in the core region of the Zn-1 site strongly affects the thermostability and the catalytic efficiency at low temperatures. The mutant enzyme I115M possessed a higher kcat at low temperatures. Elucidation of the crystal structure of I115M at a resolution ° of 1.5 A revealed that the loop structures involved in retaining the nucleophilic group and the acid catalyst are more flexible than in the wild-type enzyme.

At low temperatures, the chemical reactions essential for maintaining homeostasis in living organisms proceed at lower rates. In general, the rates of biochemical reactions are reduced by two- to three-fold for each 10 °C drop in temperature, so enzyme activity at 0 °C is expected to be 16- to 80-fold lower than that at 37 °C [1]. As a strategy for adaptation to cold environments, psychrophilic microorganisms (also known as cryophilic microorganisms) and ectothermic organisms (also known as poikilothermic organisms) produce

`cold-active enzymes'. Cold-active enzymes exhibit higher catalytic efficiencies at low and moderate temperatures but are less thermostable than mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes [2­4]. In light of these characteristics, cold-active enzymes have attracted considerable interest due to their potential for improving the efficiency of various industrial processes [5,6]. Previous studies of several cold-active enzymes have revealed two mechanisms contributing to high catalytic efficiencies at low temperatures. Some cold-active enzymes

exhibit higher kcat values compared to their highertemperature counterparts, whereas the Km values are virtually unchanged. For example, Alteromonas haloplanctis a-amylase exhibits an approximately four- to seven-fold increase in kcat compared to its porcine counterpart, without a change in the Km value [7]. Other enzymes, including a serine protease found in Gadus morhua [8] and an alkaline phosphatase found in Shewanella species [9], increase the catalytic efficiency (kcat / Km) through a combination of increased kcat and reduced Km. Thus, all cold-active enzymes display high kcat values at low temperatures. The value of kcat is dependent on both the plasticity and the elasticity of the catalytic site, which in turn depend on the flexibility of the surrounding structure [7]. A thermodynamic study of the thermal unfolding of cold-active phosphoglycerate kinase from the Pseudomonas species TACII18 suggested that the enzyme is composed of thermolabile and thermostable domains, which are respectively involved in catalytic reactions and substrate-binding [10]. Based on these observations, Lonhienne et al. [11] proposed the concept of `local flexibility and rigidity' (i.e. that flexibility in particular regions is primarily responsible for the increase in kcat at low temperature). However, the structural characteristics for eliciting high kcat at low temperatures have not been adequately examined at the molecular level. To investigate the structural characteristics responsible for eliciting high kcat values at low temperatures, we isolated cold-active protein tyrosine phosphatase (CAPTPase) with high catalytic efficiency at low temperatures and low thermostability from a psychrophilic Shewanella species [12,13]. The structural characteristics of this enzyme have been determined from biochemical experiments [14], nucleotide sequence determination [15] and X-ray crystal structure analysis ° at 1.82 A resolution [16]. The catalytic residue of CAPTPase is histidine instead of the cysteine common in protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). CAPTPase contains the `phosphoesterase motif' (Asp-X-His)-(GlyAsp-X-X-Asp-Arg)-(Gly-Asn-His-Asp / Glu), which is conserved among metallophosphoesterases, including protein serine / threonine phosphatases of bacteria [17], bacteriophage k [18] and archaea [19]. These conserved residues exist in loop structures connecting the bababfold and form the catalytic site with a dinuclear metal center, in a manner similar to other metallophosphoesterases, but not in PTPases. The presence of the phosphoesterase motif renders CAPTPase unusual with respect to other PTPases. A notable structural characteristic of CAPTPase is the large number of hydrophobic residues situated behind the loop structures comprising the catalytic site
4318

[16]. Because hydrophobic interactions are weakened as the temperature decreases [20], it has been speculated that the hydrophobic interactions play an important role in the expression of high kcat at low temperatures. In the present study, we discuss the conformation of the wild-type enzyme in further detail, examine the effect on kcat values obtained from amino acid substitution within the hydrophobic region, and describe the crystal structure of the I115M mutant enzyme, which possesses a higher kcat than the wild-type. We also discuss the structural features essential for the enzymatic characteristics of CAPTPase at low temperatures.

Results and Discussion
Detailed structure of wild-type CAPTPase Crystallographic measurements of the CAPTPase molecule using synchrotron radiation provided intensity ° data at a resolution of 1.1 A. The high-resolution data improved the measurement of anisotropic temperature factors for all non-hydrogen atoms, although the refinement was slightly low (89.2%). Our current model contains 338 amino acid residues, two metal ions and 772 water molecules in an asymmetric unit. The improved data enabled determination of the previously ambiguous locations of six residues, from Glu337 to Gln342 at the C-terminal region [16]. The improved model of CAPTPase consists of three b-sheets, termed Sheet I, Sheet I¢ and Sheet II, and 14 a-helices from aA to aN (Fig. 1A). Sheet I has three parallel b-strands and three anti-parallel b-strands. The three parallel b-strands in Sheet I form a bababfold with aB and aC. The babab-fold is a secondary structural motif that is conserved among many protein serine / threonine phosphatases, including bacteriophage k protein serine / threonine phosphatase (kPPase) [21], human calcineurin [22] and human protein serine / thre° onine phosphatase-1 [23,24]. The 1.1 A-resolution model revealed new features that were not observable ° in the previous 1.82 A structure [16]. The main chain from Ser56 to Glu58 at the beginning of the first a-helix (aA) adopted one of two conformations. Side chains with two or three conformations were found in 36 residues. Almost all residues with multiple conformations were exposed to the solvent. The catalytic site of CAPTPase consists of a catalytic Asp­His dyad (containing Asp117 and His150, a putative acid catalyst) and a dinuclear metal center (Fig. 1B). The His150 residue is linked by hydrogen bonding to water molecule W3 with the Ne2 atom of Asn149 and the oxygen atom of water molecule W1.

The dinuclear metal center is formed from two metal ions, the metal ligand residues Asp78, His80, Asp114, Asn149, His207 and His286, and the coordinating water molecules W1 and W2. Metal analysis of CAPTPase indicated the presence of 1.79 mol of Zn per mole of CAPTPase molecule, in contrast to much lower levels of Mg, Ca and Mn. The Bijvoet difference map (Fig. 1C) displayed significant peaks only at the dinuclear metal center. It was therefore concluded that the metal center of CAPTPase contains two Zn atoms. Each of the Zn ions is coordinated by five ligands in distorted pyramidal arrangements, including Asp114 and either W2 (for Zn1) or Nd1 of His286 (for Zn2) as the apical ligands (Fig. 1B). The distance between

° the two Zn atoms is 3.24 A. Other distances among amino acid residues, Zn atoms and water molecules in the catalytic site are indicated in Fig. 1D. Comparison of CAPTPase catalytic site with those of other phosphoesterases The combination of a dinuclear metal center and an Asp­His dyad is found in the catalytic sites of many phosphoesterases possessing the conserved phosphoesterase motif, including human calcineurin [25], bacteriophage kPPase [21], kidney bean purple acid phosphatase (PAP) [26] and Escherichia coli periplasmic 5¢-nucleotidase (5¢-NT) [27].

of the catalytic site of CAPTPase with those of calcineurin, PAP, kPPase and 5¢-NT suggests that the two metal atoms and the metal ligand residues of these phosphoesterases are similarly arranged (Fig. 2). Occasional differences appear in the metal ligand residues adjacent to the metal atom corresponding to Zn1 in the CAPTPase: a histidine residue in PAP or a glutamine residue in 5¢-NT was present at the position of W2 in CAPTPase, and a tyrosine residue in PAP was present at the position of His80 in CAPTPase. In superposition, the coordinating atoms of these residues were located at almost identical positions. Many phosphoesterases with a dinuclear metal center appear to have different metal ion requirements, leading to a classification of the phosphoesterases into two groups. The first group consists of enzymes with mixed-valence metal clusters. PAPs from different animal and plant species have been purified as Fe(III)­ Fe(II), Fe(III)­Zn(II) and Fe(III)­Mn(II) [26,28­31], and calcineurin contains a dinuclear Fe(III)­Zn(II) center [25]. The requirement of a mixed-valence Fe(III)­M(II) (M = Fe, Zn) cluster for the activities of PAPs and calcineurin parallels redox-dependent behavior. Unlike PAPs and calcineurin, CAPTPase and kPPase [21] have a dinuclear M(II)­M(II) center (M: Zn in CAPTPase and Mn in kPPase) [32], and these phosphoesterases may therefore be classified as a second group. The catalytic reactions of CAPTPase in this group were found to proceed independently of the redox potential of the metal ions. Nucleophilic group and reaction mechanism of CAPTPase In many metallophosphoesterases, the dinuclear metal centers are involved in the deprotonation of a water molecule to convert it into a nucleophilic group. As
4320

candidates for the nucleophiles of CAPTPase, two water molecules were observed near the dinuclear Zn­Zn center (Fig. 1B). One of the water molecules is a bridging water molecule (W1) between the two Zn atoms and the other is a coordinated water molecule (W2) of Zn1. W1 appears to be the nucleophilic group for three reasons. First, one of the obvious possible roles for the Zn atoms is to activate a water molecule by lowering the pKa. Due to its bridging form, W1 should have the lowest pKa among the water molecules at the catalytic site and should therefore most easily form a hydroxide ion. Second, a terminally coordinated water molecule, which has been identified as the nucleophile in PAP [26] and 5¢-NT [33], is not present in CAPTPase. The corresponding coordination site in CAPTPase is `empty' (Fig. 1B). Third, other metal ions besides the two Zn ions may activate the W2 water molecule, but inductively coupled plasma analysis and the Bijvoet difference map (Fig. 1C) eliminated the possibility of the presence of a third metal ion at the catalytic site. A previous model had proposed the presence of an acetic acid molecule at the catalytic site [16] and therefore the reaction mechanism of CAPTPase was unclear. Our current model is consistent with catalysis by CAPTPase proceeding by the following mechanism. First, the phosphate moiety in the substrate, phosphotyrosine, is stabilized by coordinate bonds to the two Zn atoms and by hydrogen bonding to the Ne2 atom of His150. Nucleophilic attack by W1 on the phosphorus atom results in the cleavage of one of the double bonds between the oxygen and the phosphorus atom, forming an intermediate phosphate moiety with five oxygen atoms. The anionic oxygen atom then immediately attacks the phosphorus linkage and the phosphomonoester bond of the substrate molecule is broken by protonation with His150 as a general acid

catalyst. Finally, another water molecule coordinates with the two Zn ions and the product phosphate ion leaves the catalytic site. Hydrophobic sites around the catalytic site CAPTPase contains many hydrophobic residues situated behind the loop structures comprising the catalytic site (Fig. 3A). In general, hydrophobic interactions are weakened as the temperature decreases [20]. Accordingly, the structural components affecting the plasticity and elasticity of the catalytic site at low temperatures are assumed to be localized within the

hydrophobic moieties. The hydrophobic moieties of CAPTPase may be segregated into the CA, Zn-1 and Zn-2 sites (Fig. 3A). The CA site is located behind the secondary structures containing the catalytic pair of residues Asp117 and His150, and behind the Zn2-coordinating residue Asn149. The site is composed of Phe116, Met147, Leu159, Val162 and Val232 in loop structures, Leu155 in aD, Tyr166 in aE, Tyr177 and Tyr181 in aF, and Leu191 in aG. The Zn-1 site interacts with the loop structures through Asp78, His80 and Asp114, which are coordinated with the Zn1 atom. The site is formed by the residues Val79, Met111, Ile115 and Leu145 in loop structures and by

the surrounding residues Val85, Leu86, Leu89, Leu90, Met109, Val125, Leu126, Met129, Val143 and Ile307. The Zn-2 site maintains loops with His207 and His286 coordinated with the Zn2 atom. The site is formed by the residues Leu146, Met206, Ile210 and Val284 in the loops and by the surrounding residues Val110, Ile197, Leu204, Tyr205, Trp214, Tyr260, Ile273, Phe277, Ile282 and Val300. To determine which hydrophobic sites affect the activity of CAPTPase, mutant enzymes were prepared in which various hydrophobic residues were substituted with Ala. Specific activity measurements for enzymes possessing the mutations V79A, V85A, I115A, L145A and I307A at the Zn-1 site exhibited remarkably lower activities, which were less than 5% of the wild-type (Fig. 3A). By contrast, substitution of hydrophobic residues at the CA and Zn-2 sites did not result in large reductions in activity. The three hydrophobic residues Val79, Ile115 and Leu145 form a hydrophobic core centering Met111 in the Zn-site, whereas Val85 in aB and Ile307 in aN form an outer core. The substitution of these residues by Ala may lead to disadvantageous flexibility at the catalytic site and a pronounced reduction in catalytic activity. The two hydrophobic cores are therefore considered to be particularly important with respect to the functional structure of CAPTPase. We also examined the low-temperature dependence of kcat on the hydrophobicity and bulkiness of the side chains of the five residues. The mutant enzymes, in which the five amino acid residues were substituted with other hydrophobic amino acids, were prepared as homogeneous proteins. Table 1 contains estimates for the kinetic parameters of the mutant enzymes at 5 °C. The rank orders of the kcat values were Val (wild)  Ile > Leu > Ala = Met for Val79 variants, Val (wild) > Leu > Met > Phe  Ala for Val85 variants, Phe > Met > Ile (wild) = Leu = Val  Ala for Ile115 variants, Leu (wild) = Met > Phe > Ala = Val for Leu145 variants, and Ile (wild)  Met > Leu > Phe = Ala for Ile307 variants. The hydrophobicity and bulkiness of the hydrophobic amino acids followed the order Leu = Ile > Val > Phe > Met > Ala [34] and Phe > Met > Ile > Leu > Val > Ala [35]. These rankings coupled with the experimental results indicate that, at low temperatures, kcat is dependent on the bulkiness of the hydrophobic residues rather than the hydrophobicity. It is necessary that the 79th residue, situated below Met111 in Fig. 3A, be valine. In kPPase [21], kidney bean PAP [26] and human calcineurin [25], this position is occupied by the bulkier Ile or Leu. The leucine residue at position 145 on the upper side of Met111

can be replaced by the more bulky amino acids Met or Phe, but not by the more compact Ala or Val. Substitution of Ile115 by bulky amino acids such as Met or Phe produced mutant enzymes (I115M and I115F) exhibiting higher kcat values than the wild-type enzyme. The increased kcat values and the decreased Km values resulted in I115M and I115F exhibiting catalytic efficiencies that were 1.65- and 1.88-fold higher (kcat / Km) than the wild-type. Substitution of Ile307 by other amino acids led to lower kcat values independent of the hydrophobicity or the bulkiness. The kcat value of the respective Val85 variant was reduced as the valine was substituted with residues of increasing bulkiness. To achieve a high kcat value for CAPTPase at low temperature, it is essential that the compact hydrophobic residue (Val79) and the bulky residues (Ile115 and Leu145) in the loop structures are arranged correctly with respect to Met111. Optimum performance was achieved when the 85th and 307th residues were Val and Ile, respectively. The hydrophobic interaction between Val85 and Ile307 might be important for maintaining the conformations of aB and aN, judging from the location of these residues.

In many cold-active enzymes, the higher catalytic efficiency at low temperatures is accompanied by lower thermostability [3]. The thermostabilities of the I115M and I115F mutant enzymes, which exhibited higher catalytic efficiency than the wild-type enzyme, were measured and compared with the wild-type (Fig. 4). During a 60 min incubation at 30 °C, the activity of the I115M mutant enzyme gradually decreased to 62%, whereas the activity of the I115F mutant decreased to 38%. At 40 °C, the activities decreased to 48% for I115M and 10% for I115F. By contrast, the wild-type enzyme maintained 80% and 75% activity after incubation at 30 °C and 40 °C, respectively, for 60 min. Increased hydrophobicity generally increases the stability of the globular proteins. However, the rank order of the thermostability was wild > I115M > I115F. It therefore appears that the thermo stability also depends on the bulkiness of the 115th residue. The conformation of the hydrophobic core in the mutant enzymes appears to be better suited for low-temperature activity than the wild-type.

model has 331 amino acid residues, two Zn ions and 629 water molecules in an asymmetric unit. The main chain structure of the I115M mutant enzyme was found to be the same as that of the wild-type (Fig. 5A). However, the side-chain conformations of the hydrophobic amino acid residues at and near the 115th residue at the Zn-1 site differ considerably between the mutant enzyme and wild-type (Fig. 5B) in several ways. The side chains of the Met115 and Met111 residues in the I115M mutant enzyme adopt alternative conformations that are not observed in the wild-type enzyme. Additionally, the side chain of Leu145 in the I115M mutant enzyme is located a greater distance from Met115. The alternative conformation of Met111 and the conformational shift of Leu145 are the result of either repulsive or extrusive effects caused by the alternative conformation and the bulkier side chain of Met115. Interference within the side chains of Met111, Met115 and Leu145 might explain the increased flexibility of the loop structures containing these residues. The influence of the conformational difference in Met111 and Leu145 on the flexibility of the loop structures in the catalytic site was examined by comparison of the normalized B-factors between the I115M mutant and the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5C). As a result, the loop structure containing Asp78 and His80, the loop containing Asp114 and Asp117, the loop containing Asn149, and the helix structure aD containing His150 of the I115M mutant enzyme exhibited higher B-factor values for the main chain atoms than the wild-type, as did several regions of the molecular surface. The metal ligand residues Asp78, His80, Asp114 and Asn149 coordinate the Zn2+ ions retaining the nucleophilic water molecule, whereas His150 acts as the acid catalyst by hydrogen-bonding to Asp117 (Fig. 1B). Replacement of Ile115 with Met could increase the flexibility of the loop structures. The increased flexibility of the loop structures provided relatively higher perturbation (approximately 1.1-fold higher than the wild-type) of the metal ligand residue side chains (Asp78, His80, Asp114, Asn149 and His207) and the catalytic pair composed of Asp117 and His150 (Table 2). By contrast, the normalized B-factor of the nucleophilic W1 in the I115M mutant enzyme was relatively low, suggesting that increased flexibility might facilitate the placement of W1 at the appropriate location for nucleophilic attack. Substitution of Ile115 with Met could result in higher perturbation of the acid catalyst His150 and the appropriate location of the nucleophilic group (Fig. 6). It was confirmed that a bulkier side chain at position 115 in the hydrophobic core of CAPTPase yields higher catalytic efficiency at low tem4324

Fig. 6. Illustration for the relationship between the flexibility of the loop structure in the catalytic site and the catalytic efficiency at low temperature. Substitution of Ile115 with Met leads the alternative conformation of Met111 and the conformational shift of Leu145. The interference within the side chains of Met111, Met115 (in I115M mutant enzyme) and Leu145 increases the flexibility of the loop structures with the metal ligand residues (Asp78, His80, Asp114 and Asn149) and Asp117 in the catalytic dyad. The more flexible loop structures in I115M mutant enzyme than those in wild-type represent as red lines. The increased flexibility of these loops provides the metal ligands and the catalytic dyad with higher fluctuation and, putatively, the nucleophile with a more appropriate location for the catalysis of CAPTPase. As a result, the I115M mutant enzyme can elicit a lower Km value, a higher kcat value and a higher catalytic efficiency (kcat / Km) at low temperature. Dashed line represents the hydrogen bond between His150 and Asp117 and dotted lines represent the coordinate bonds to Zn atoms (Zn1 and Zn2).

peratures as well as lower thermostability, by increasing the flexibility of the loop structures in the catalytic site. In conclusion, the bulkiness of the amino acids forming the hydrophobic core in the Zn-1 site increases the flexibility of the loop structures and dominates the plasticity and elasticity of the catalytic site. The hydrophobic core in the Zn-1 site is therefore an essential structural component for catalytic efficiency at low temperatures and is also responsible for the low thermostability of CAPTPase.

was purchased from Seikagakukogyo Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). The pT7-Blue and pET22b plasmid vectors and competent E. coli AD494(DE3) cells were purchased from Merck Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents were of analytical grade.

Expression and purification of wild-type and mutant enzymes
Mutant genes were constructed using the overlap extension PCR method [36] and synthetic oligonuleotides. The genes encoding the mutant enzymes were inserted between the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites of the expression plasmid pET22b. E. coli AD494 (DE3) was transformed with the resultant plasmid to express the mutant enzymes. The expressed enzymes were purified using a series of chromatographic columns: stepwise elution with 0.22 m NaCl through a Q-Sepharose FF column, stepwise elution with 150 mm sodium phosphate through a Cellulofine-HAP column, and gradient elution through a Mono-Q GL5 / 50 column using a linear gradient of 0­0.15 m NaCl.

Measurement of metal content in CAPTPase
The magnesium, calcium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper and zinc contents of the enzymes were analyzed by means of inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry using a Shimadzu ICPS-8000 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The torch was operated at a power of 1200 W and a height of 11 mm, the coolant gas flow was adjusted to 14.0 LÆmin)1, the plasma gas flow was 1.2 LÆmin)1, and the carrier gas flow was 0.70 LÆmin)1. The analysis wavelengths were 279.553 nm for magnesium, 393.366 nm for calcium, 257.610 nm for manganese, 238.892 nm for cobalt, 231.604 nm for nickel, 324.754 nm for copper, and 213.586 nm for zinc.

[39]. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 3. The models were evaluated using procheck [40]. Figs 1, 2, 3 and 5 were obtained using raster3d [41], bobscript [42], molscript [43] and pymol [44].

Measurement of activities
Phosphatase activity was measured in 100 lL of a reaction mixture containing 50 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.0), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate and the desired amount of enzyme. After incubation at 5 °C for 2 min, 1.0 mL of 0.1 m NaOH was added to stop the reaction, and A410 was measured. When the thermostabilities of the wild-type and mutant enzymes were examined, the activities were determined at 20 °C for 2 min, during which the reaction proceeded linearly. The concentration of the enzyme reaction product was determined using a calibration curve based on p-nitrophenol.

Crystallization, data collection and improvement of model
The protein concentration at crystallization was 4.5 mgÆmL)1. Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method [37] using a reservoir solution containing 30% (w / v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m ammonium acetate and 0.1 m Tris­HCl (pH 8.5). The structures of the wild-type and mutant enzymes were determined using ° the phase of the model for the wild-type at 1.82 A [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1V73]. The X-ray diffraction images of the CAPTPase crystals were obtained at a resolu° ° tion of 1.1 A (wild-type) and 1.5 A (I115M mutant enzyme) with a charge-coupled device detector (Jupiter210; Rigaku MSC Co., Tokyo, Japan) using synchrotron radiation at the beam line BL38B1 of SPring-8 (Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan). During acquisition, the crystal was cooled to 100 °K under a nitrogen gas stream. The images were processed using the hkl-2000 program package (Denzo and Scalepack) (HKL Research, Inc., Charlottesville, VA, USA) [38]. The cell dimensions were refined by the least-squares method. Model building was performed using the graphics program turbo-frodo (AFMB-CNRS, Marseille, France) on a Silicon Graphics Octane computer, and the refinement calculations were carried out using the shelx-97 program package
