ABSTRACT: NMR spectroscopy in aqueous and dimethyl sulfoxide/water solutions is used to determine the three-dimensional structures of microcystin-LR, a cyclic cyanobacterial heptapeptide toxin which is a potent inhibitor of type 1 and type 2A protein phosphatases. The conformations of this toxic peptide are studied using a simulated annealing (SA) protocol followed by refined SA calculations in Vacuo and free MD simulations in water. Only one conformational family in each solvent is found. The peptide ring has a saddle-shaped form, essentially the same in both solvents. The structural difference observed between the two solution structures is located to the part consisting of Mdha, Ala, and Leu. This peptide segment is not present in nodularin, a cyclic pentapeptide of similar toxicity. The Arg side chain is very flexible, while the side chain of Leu is well defined. The side chain of Adda, essential for toxicity, is constrained in the vicinity of the backbone ring but appears to be flexible in the more remote part.

Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) grow world-wide in eutrophic fresh and brackish water as well as in marine environments. They frequently cause animal and human water-based toxicosis (Carmichael, 1988a; Codd et al., 1989) as they produce a number of different toxins. Several species among the cyanobacterial genera Microcystis, Oscillatoria, Anabena, and Nostoc produce certain cyclic heptapeptide hepatotoxins called microcystins (Botes et al., 1984; Meriluoto et al., 1989; Rinehart et al., 1994; Carmichael et al., 1988b). These peptides have a common invariable cyclic structure (Scheme 1) with certain variable sections. The main structural difference between different microcystins is the variation of the two L-amino acids labeled X and Z in Scheme 1. Omitted methyl substitutions of D-erythro- methylaspartic acid (Masp)1 and N-methyldehydroalanine (Mdha) are also common structural modifications (Namikoshi et al., 1992). More than 40 different microcystins have been isolated and characterized (Rinehart et al., 1994). The most prevalent toxin of this type is microcystin-LR (Scheme 1),

A brackish water cyanobacterium, Nodularia spumigena (Rinehart et al., 1994; Sivonen et al., 1989), produces a related cyclic pentapeptide hepatotoxin called nodularin (Scheme 1).

Microcystins contain a dehydroalanine moiety while nodularin has a 2-(methylamino)-2-dehydrobutyric (Mdhb) acid unit. A cyclic pentapeptide toxin designated motuporin, which is closely related structurally to nodularin, has been isolated from the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei (de Silva et al., 1992). The structure of motuporin is that of (L-Val2)nodularinsa variation of the arginine residue in nodularin which corresponds to the variation of the X,Z-amino acid residues in microcystins. Microcystins, as well as nodularin and motuporin, are biologically and biochemically highly interesting compounds as they are potent and specific inhibitors of type-1 and type2A protein phosphatases, two of the major serine-/threoninespecific protein phosphatases in eukaryotic cells. Their inhibitor activities are similar to those of okadaic acid and calyculin-A (Matsushima et al., 1990; Sivonen et al., 1992a; MacKintosh et al., 1990; Eriksson et al., 1990). All of these compounds have been a considerable asset in elucidating the in ViVo functions of protein phosphatases. Interestingly, microcystins and presumably nodularin are also tumour promoters (Fujiki et al., 1991; Nishiwaki et al., 1992) with potencies equal to those of okadaic acid and calyculin-A (Fujiki et al., 1989). The stereochemistry of the Adda residue seems to be essential for activity and toxicity of microcystins (Harada et al., 1990a; Namikoshi et al., 1990). When the configuration of the Adda double bond system is altered from (4E,6E), to (4E,6Z), the resulting stereoisomer shows no toxicity (Harada et al., 1990a,b). Hydrogenation or ozonolysis of this diene system also gives nontoxic products.2 Some variations of the Adda structure are, however, without effects on the biological activity. The toxicity of microcystins with an acetoxy group at the Adda C-9 position is equal to that of microcystins with a methoxy group at the same position (Namikoshi et al., 1990). The amino acid Adda is itself reported to be a nontoxic component (Namikoshi et al., 1989). While there is ample information as to the toxicity and mechanisms of action of these cyanobacterial peptides, their three-dimensional structures are only now emerging. Preliminary NMR spectroscopy studies have been performed on microcystin-LR and microcystin-LY in DMSO (Bagu et al., 1995) and on microcystin-LR and motuporin in water (Rudolpf-Bohner et al., 1994). In these studies, the various ¨ structures proposed for the peptides have been based exclusively on distance geometry calculations. The crystal structure of protein phosphatase-1, complexed with microcystin-LR, has recently been determined (Goldberg et al., 1995). The biological relevance of the examination of peptides in DMSO been discussed (Saulitis et al., 1992). Since the receptors for these molecules most likely are composed of both lipophilic and hydrophobic portions, DMSO will presumably better mimic these properties than can aqueous solutions. Furthermore, in order to mimic the viscosity in cells, a DMSO-d6/H2O (80/20, v/v) cryoprotective mixture

was chosen as solvent. The viscosity varies from 10 to 2 cp in the temperature range of 265-315 K vs a viscosity of 0.8 cp for water at room temperature (Shichman & Amey, 1971). At low temperature this mixture has properties close to that of water at room temperature (Motta et al., 1988; Amodeo et al., 1991). Here we present the structures of microcystin-LR in water and in DMSO/water as obtained from restrained MD calculations in Vacuo. In addition, the possibility of conformational exchange has been explored by J-coupling analysis, by amide proton exchange studies, and by unrestrained MD simulations in water. This has enabled an evaluation of whether the resultant restrained MD structures represent reasonable pictures of the solution structures or if they represent averages of substantially different conformations in rapid exchange. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Sample Preparation. Microcystin-LR was purified (Meriluoto et al., 1989) from Microcystis aeruginosa collected from a natural bloom in the lake Akersvatn, Norway (Berg et al., 1987). For the NMR measurements, two samples, one in DMSO-d6/H2O (80/20, v/v) and the other in H2O/ D2O (94/6, v/v), were prepared from the lyophilized peptide. The DMSO/water solution contained 2-2.5 mg of freezedried microcystin in 0.56 mL of DMSO and 0.14 mL of 20 mM phosphate buffer giving a pH value of 5.9. The aqueous sample was prepared by dissolving 1.4-1.6 mg of material in water (including D2O) to yield a concentration of approximately 2 mM. The pH was then adjusted to 5.6 with NaOH and HCl. Later the peptide was relyophilized and dissolved in D2O for exchange rate measurements. The samples contained a stereoisomer of microcystin-LR as a minor component (<5%). An estimated 20 mM concentration of acetonitrile remained in the water sample as an impurity emanating from the purification medium. NMR Experiments. The NMR spectra of the sample dissolved in DMSO/water were acquired at 500 MHz (Varian Unity 500 and Bruker AMX2 500), while the NMR spectra of the sample dissolved in water were acquired at 600 MHz (Varian Unity 600). In all experiments the solvent signal was suppressed by continuous presaturation ( 1  100 Hz) during the relaxation delay of 2-3 s. The 2D NMR spectra were acquired in a phase sensitive mode in t1, i.e., TPPI (Bruker) or States-TPPI (Varian). Parameters for the NMR experiments are compiled in Table 1. The NMR experiments were conducted at 4 °C in DMSO/ water and at 1 °C in water. The molecular tumbling is in a

Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 10, 1996 3199 the experimental data were used as starting models for the MARDIGRAS calculations. Three structures having substantially different conformations, i.e., structures with a pairwise rms deviation of more than 2 Å for backbone heavy atoms, were used. (An initial model of microcystin-LR with correct local geometry was subjected to unrestrained MD calculations at 1000 K to generate 10 different structures from which the three mutually most dissimilar structures were chosen.) Upper and lower bounds for interproton distances were obtained by comparing the results of the MARDIGRAS calculations while varying the starting models. All calculations were performed with a rotational correlation time, c, of 2 ns in DMSO/H2O and 1 ns in H2O, respectively. These correlation times were derived from the relation between the experimental spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and the spin-spin relaxation time (T2) (Suzuki et al., 1986). Simulations of DQF-COSY cross peaks, using the programs SPHINX and LINSHA (Widmer & Wutrich, ¨ 1986), were employed to allow an accurate determination of vicinal coupling constants from the spectrum recorded in DMSO/H2O. This enabled determination of proton-proton coupling constants in the backbone as well as in the side chains. The J-doubling algorithm (McIntyre & Freeman, 1992) was used to extract coupling constants from spectrum recorded in H2O. The obtained vicinal 3JNH,H-C(R) coupling constants were corrected for the electronegativity effect of the C(R) substituents using the relation 3JNH,H-C(R) ) 1.09Jobs (Bystrow, 1976). Dihedral angles were calculated from the coupling constants by the Karplus equation (Bystrow, 1976) with the coefficients A ) 9.4, B ) -1.1, and C ) 0.4 Hz for 3JNH,H-C(R) and A ) 9.4, B ) -1.4, and C ) 1.6 for 3J 3 H-C(R),H-C( ). For this study the JNH,H-C(R) coupling constants were used as conformational constraints when greater than 8.0 Hz or smaller than 5.0 Hz: 3JNH,H-C(R) > 8.0 suggesting a  between -80 and -125, 3JNH,H-C(R) > 10.0 suggesting a  between -100 and -140 and 3JNH,H-C(R) < 5.0 Hz suggests  between 155 and 195 (Glu). For Masp and Adda the dihedrals HA-CA-CB-HB were set to 55 ( 20 and 150 ( 30, respectively. Restrained MD Calculations. The ab initio simulated annealing protocol (Nilges et al., 1988), described in the manual of the X-PLOR 3.0 program, was used to determine the three-dimensional structure of microcystin-LR. A set of 73 (97)3 interproton distance restraints comprising 22 (26) interresidue and 51 (71) intraresidue distances and 8 (8) dihedral constraints were used for the calculation of the structure in DMSO/H2O (H2O/D2O). Among the interresidue distances one originated from a NOE cross peak between Masp3 and one of the -protons in Glu6 and in water also between Leu2HN and the same -proton. The starting structures for the SA calculations were varied to ascertain that the results represented a global energy minimum of the conformational space. Structures with different conformational properties were generated by exerting unrestrained MD at an elevated temperature (Vide supra). The three most divergent of these structures, with a pairwise rms deviation of 2 Å or more for backbone heavy atoms, were used as a variable in the SA calculations. One hundred calculations using the SA protocol were carried out per template. Initial velocities were assigned from a Maxwellian distribution at 1000 K. The high temperature period

region of slow motion [(c)2 . 1] at these conditions. Hydrogen to deuterium exchange was also observed at 1 °C. Variable temperature experiments were conducted in the range from 1 to 41 °C. ROESY experiments were performed to examine dynamic processes such as possible conformational exchange. Proton relaxation times, T1 and T2, were measured using inversion-recovery and CPMG pulse sequences, respectively. All 2D data were zero-filled and then Fourier transformed to 2K × 1K data matrices. Chemical shifts were referenced to solvent signals, i.e., 2.50 ppm for DMSO/water and 5.01 ppm for water. Extraction of Parameters for MD Calculations. All spin systems were identified from TOCSY and COSY/DQFCOSY spectra. The sequential assignment was derived from the connectivities in the NH/H-C(R) region of NOESY spectra. An expanded portion of a NOESY spectrum is shown in Figure 1. The chemical shifts of the nonexchanging protons are in good agreement with previous published assignment of microcystin-LR in deuterated methanol (CD3OD) (Harada et al., 1990a). Stereospecificity of geminal protons was concluded from 3J coupling constants and NOE data. 2D NOE cross peak integration was carried out as a simple sum of points in a region with an optional subtraction of an average baseline per point. For every cross peak, a zoom box was adjusted to surround the region of integration. For more accurate determination of the volumes, surface fitting was applied with a convergence criterion of 0.01%. Interproton distances were generated from the 2D NOE cross peak integrals by using the program MARDIGRAS (Borgias & James, 1989, 1990). A complete 2D NOE relaxation matrix was set up using the geometry of a starting structure to account for all those interproton NOEs not available from

consisted of 10 000 steps followed by 5000 steps for the cooling to 100 K. In subsequent refined SA calculations 7000 steps were used. The integration step was chosen to 0.003 ps. All SA calculations were followed by 300 steps of Powell's minimization algorithm. The number and size of distance-constraint violations and R factors have been exploited as a measure for the agreement between the model structure and NMR data. Unrestrained MD Simulations. Unrestrained MD simulations of the molecule in water were performed by using the program CHARMm (Brooks et al., 1983). The structure with the lowest energy from restrained MD simulation was immersed in a box (34.1 × 27.9 × 27.9 Å3) containing 863 water molecules. All water molecules closer than 2.8 Å to the solute molecule were removed. The entire system, comprised of the peptide and 795 water molecules, was subjected to free MD calculation with periodic boundary conditions. Initial velocities from a Maxwellian distribution were given at 98 K for all atoms. During the first picosecond the system was heated to 298 K and, after every 100 steps, the velocities were reassigned. The reassignment of the velocities was continued during the second picosecond if the temperature of the system was outside the desired temperature with more than (10 K. Using the same criterion during the next 20 ps, the velocities were rescaled. The simulation after 22 ps was performed without any external perturbations. Integration of equations of motion was carried out using a step size of 1 fs. The lists for nonbonded and hydrogen bond interactions were updated after every 20 fs. The cut-off value of nonbonded interactions was set to 13 Å. Coordinates for all atoms in the system were recorded every 100 steps. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Quality of the Structures. The spectra of microcystin-LR in both solvents contain only one set of signals at low temperature. Thus, there are no indications of exchange on the NMR time scale. Of the 300 calculated structures in each solvent, 228 structures in DMSO and 292 structures in water passed the acceptance test, which consisted of the ranges of bonds, angles, distance constraints, and dihedral constraints violations. The criteria for acceptance were as follows: rmsd for bonds, < 0.01 Å; rmsd for angles, < 2°; no NOE violations, > 0.3 Å; no constraint dihedral violations, > 5°. The quality of the accepted structures has been analyzed using R factors, constraint violations, and rms deviations. The rmsd for all heavy atoms and backbone heavy atoms as compared with the average structure (Table 2) clearly shows that the cyclic backbone is very well defined. The major part of rmsd originates in the side chains. The rmsd from the average structure as a function of atom number, shown in Figure 3, varies substantially within each calculation (DMSO/water and water, respectively). Bearing in mind that the backbone atoms contribute very little to the total value of rmsd, the significant variation of rmsd's calculated per residue originate largely from the different

The disadvantage of using this R factor is its tendency to favor strong cross peaks associated with short distances (<2.5 Å). Instead, a modified R factor, R1x, is preferred. R1x utilizes the sixth-root relationship between NOE intensities and appropriate distances (Thomas et al., 1991):

structures (228 for DMSO/H2O and 292 for H2O). As the NOE density per atom in the Adda residue is significantly lower in comparison to the other residues, the R1x factor calculated with and without inclusion of NOEs in the Adda side chain is shown. Description of the Structures. The two families of solution structures of microcystin-LR are shown in Figure 3 (panels A and B). Superpositions of 20 structures, randomly chosen from all accepted structures in each solvent, are shown. The peptide ring is saddle-shaped in both solvents with carboxyl residues (Masp and Glu) on the sides (roughly in the "stirrup positions"). In both solvent systems, the Adda side chain is directed away from the cyclic backbone and also well defined in the proximity to the ring. No structures were found in which the Adda chain, which is essential for hepatotoxicity (Harada et al., 1990a,b), was bent into a position above the ring as has been suggested (Rudolph-Bohner et al., 1994). ¨ Figure 4 depicts the superposition of the average structures of microcystin-LR in DMSO/water and water, respectively. The backbone segment Masp3-Arg4-Adda5-Glu6 of the structure in the cryosolvent mixture is superimposed on the same

backbone atoms in the water structure. The rmsd for backbone heavy atoms in this part of the structure is only 0.36 Å, and 0.65 Å for all heavy atoms in the backbone. The largest differences between the two structures can be seen in the segment containing the other three residues, i.e., Mdha7, Ala1, and Leu2. The conformational differences between the backbones in this region are due to changes of the backbone dihedrals in the vicinity of the amide bond between Mdha7 and Ala1 (see Table 5). As a result, the Ala1NH in the two solvents points in different directions. It is interesting to see that the differences in the chemical structure between microcystins and nodularins are localized to the specific peptide portion in which the conformational difference between the two solution structures of microcystin-LR is obvious. Hence, we suggest for nodularin a very similar structure to microcystin-LR for the remaining homologous segment. These structural features are likely to be responsible for their similar biological properties. The temperature dependence of the Masp3NH and the Adda5NH chemical shifts is minimal and very similar for both solvents (Table 6). This observation, as well as the presence of slow hydrogen to deuterium exchange rates

During the first 3 h, the LeuNH and GluNH exchanged entirely, while the intensity of the AddaNH was not reduced by more than 20% even after 15 h. The NH of Masp remained essentially unaltered.

(Figure 5), indicates that these protons are shielded from the solvent and that microcystin-LR has a well-defined structure. Using the cut-off criteria of 2.8 Å for the distance between donor and acceptor and 60° deviation of the hydrogen bond from linearity, we find only weak hydrogen bond interactions. In water, the NH of Leu2 can pair with CO of Glu6 while the distance between donor and acceptor is too long in DMSO/water. The difference in temperature dependence for the Leu2NH between the two solvents supports this. We also find that Glu6NH and Adda5NH can pair with COOof Masp3 in both solvent environments. The Ala1NH and Arg4NH are directed outward and thereby exposed to the solvent. The difference in temperature dependence between the two solvents can be explained by the conformational divergence between the backbones in this region. The restrained MD calculations result in one conformational family in each solvent that is clearly indicated by the low value of rmsd for the backbone heavy atoms. This is in contrast to results obtained by Bohner et al. (Rudolph¨ Bohner et al., 1994), who reported the existence of three ¨ conformational families in DMSO as a result of distance geometry calculations. These authors describe their family structures by defining a plane array of the peptide backbone of the amino acids Adda5-Glu6-Mdha7. Considering this segment as a flat part of the peptide backbone, our structures are in agreement with one of their families, with Arg protruding in one direction from this flat part and Leu-Masp on the opposite side. The saddle shape of the ring in our structures is in agreement with that of the DG calculated solution structures (aqueous) presented by Bagu et al. (1995) but differ from the results obtained by Lanaras et al. (1991) and Taylor et al. (1992), who predicted a planar ring using molecular modeling methods. Our calculated conformations of microcystin-LR are very similar to the crystal structure, where the toxin is complexed with protein phosphatase-1 (Goldberg et al., 1995). Interestingly, it appears that the DMSO/H2O structure has the same conformation for Mdha, Ala, and Leu as compared to the phosphatase complex. Hence, the observed difference in solution structures represents the conformational change which microcystin-LR has to adopt upon binding to the enzyme in a water environment.

Results from Free MD Simulation and Comparison with Restrained MD Calculation. The disadvantage with restrained MD calculations is that possible flexibility within the molecule is neglected. In order to gain more insight into dynamic processes of microcystin-LR in solution, unrestrained MD simulations of the molecule in water were performed (Saulitis et al., 1992). Molecular dynamics calculation of microcystin-LR with explicit included water molecules was continued up to 372 ps. The temperature profile as a function of simulation time shown in Figure 6a, indicates a well-behaved and stable calculation. Additionally, the rmsd of the backbone atoms from the starting structure (Figure 6b) indicates a stable dynamic behavior of microcystin-LR during the whole simulation. The average value of the rmsd calculated for the total trajectory is 0.78 Å. Consequently, the 20 superimposed structures, chosen every 16 ps from the trajectory and shown in Figure 3C, appear to be very similar to the structures calculated using NMR constraints (Figure 3A,B). The greater flexibility of the Adda side chain during the free MD simulation is also obvious, while a conformation with the Adda side chain positioned over the ring, as suggested by Rudolpf-Bohner ¨ et al. (1994) was not observed. Twenty-one out of the twenty-five torsion angles, defined along the backbone of microcystin-LR, show only small fluctuations at their starting values. This finding also strengthens the suggestion that microcystin-LR occurs in one major conformation only, at least on the subnanosecond time scale. The time development of the remaining four torsion angles, with changes over time, are shown in Figure 7. The average values of all backbone torsion angles are assembled under "free MD" in Table 5. Two values of the angles are given in the cases where the torsion angles clearly exist in two different states. The interproton distance restraints generated from the 2D NOESY spectrum recorded in water were compared with their counterparts obtained as averages from free MD simulation. The difference, , between the distance given by the latter and the closest value of the upper or the lower bound of corresponding restraint was calculated. Five distances for which  exceeds 0.5 Å are shown as profiles for the whole simulation time in Figure 8. Three of those,

Leu2HA-Leu2HG, Adda5H4-Adda5HN, and Adda5H5Adda5HB, involve side chain atoms, and therefore their deviations from the values predicted, using the NOESY spectrum, are reasonable in the light of their shorter rotational correlation times. The latter two distances, which are partially responsible for the alignment of the Adda side chain with the backbone of the peptide, occur in free MD simulation as two different states that are correlated in time with the observed rotation of the dihedral HB-CB-C4H4 about the single bond C3-C4 in Adda (data not shown). The NOE data rules out that the conformation with the longer interproton distance could represent the solution structure. However, only a small population of the second conformation gave rise to the observed NOE intensity due to the inverse sixth power dependence on distance. Accordingly, the NOE intensity cannot distinguish between different population ratios. In contrast, experimental J coupling constants represent the time average of the existing conformations. The experimental coupling constant 3J(H-CB/H-C4) (9 Hz) represents an average of the angles found in the MD trajectory. Consequently, both NOE and J coupling data are convertible with two local conformations in rapid exchange. The fluctuation of the Glu6HN-Adda5HN distance correlates in time with the changes of the torsion angles C3N4-CA4-C4, N4-CA4-C4-N5, CA4-C4-N5-CB5, and C4-N5-CB5-CA5 (see Figure 7) for which two different states were detected. The proton-proton coupling constant, corresponding to the dihedral C3-N4-CA4-C4, evaluated from the COSY spectrum, is 10.3 Hz, while the average value from the free MD is 4.8 Hz. However, in the range between 100 and 200 ps, the back-calculated mean value of this coupling constant is 10.7 Hz. Thus, the observed coupling constant indicates that the conformation found between 100 and 200 ps in MD is the predominant

one. Moreover, the NOE data confirm the relevance of this suggestion since the observed NOE intensity gives the long distance found in this conformation, i.e., 2.5 Å rather than 2.1 Å. Finally, the last distance with a large  value is the distance between Leu2HN and Glu6HB2. In free MD, the observed distance is in the range 3-6 Å. Thirteen percent (13%) of all saved structures have a distance shorter than 3.8 Å, which is the upper bound in the restrained MD calculations. Considering the relatively large error for long distances and the inverse sixth power dependence on distance, the experimental data are in agreement with the MD. In general, the solution structures based on NMR measurements might represent time-averaged structures of rapidly exchanging conformations. The differences between the experimentally derived and the dihedral angles from the trajectory of the peptide in the free MD simulation are listed in Table 5. Relatively large deviations for angles in the Mdha part of the peptide can be seen. It might very well be so that the free MD simulation better describes the structure that does the SA calculation, as there are few constraints where Mdha is involved [no 3J(NH,H-CR) coupling constant and overlapping signals]. The Leu2 side chain is well defined for both solvent structures of microcystin-LR. The 3 J(H-CR,H-C ) coupling constants can reveal conformations of the side chains (Montelione et al., 1989; Mierke & Kessler, 1993). If both 3JR coupling constants are smaller than 5 Hz, or if they differ by more than 5 Hz, the side chain has a well-defined conformation. For Leu2, these coupling constants are 11.0 and 4.0 Hz, which clearly supports the results from the restrained MD calculations (11.3 and 5.0 Hz, respectively). The corresponding values obtained from the simulation in water are 9.3 and 6.7 Hz, respectively. The

Arg4 side chain is highly disordered in both derived structural families. The mean values of the 3J(H-CR,H-C ) coupling constants for this residue, calculated from SA structures, are 5.0 and 7.9 Hz. The result from the free simulation is 6.2 and 8.0 Hz, respectively. The coupling constants for the Adda side chain (Table 8) indicate that the structure should be flexible in the remote part but better defined close to the backbone ring, since the coupling constant is 9 Hz between H-CB/H-C4 and H-C7/ H-C8. The superimposed structures obtained from the restrained MD calculations (Figure 3A,B) show that the Adda side chain is well-defined for the part C4-C7, i.e., the entire conjugated system essential for the toxicity. The line widths also support this interpretation, as they are sharper for more distant protons.

a Vicinal coupling constants are calculated for each structure from Pachler's form of the Karplus equation where account is taken into the substituent effect (Pachler, 1972) and then averaged. b The MD calculations were performed without using dihedral constraints in the Adda chain.

Conclusions. The present results indicate that microcystinLR in solution essentially adopts a single backbone conformation. The backbone of the peptide is saddle shaped with the flat-like part including the residues Adda5-Glu6-Mdha7. The side chains of Arg4 and the remote part of Adda5 are quite flexible without any well-defined structure. No conformation with the Adda side chain positioned over the ring was observed as earlier suggested. These results are supported by the restrained MD calculation (simulated annealing) based on NMR measurements as well as free MD simulation of microcystin-LR in water. Structural differences are found in the residues Mdha7, Ala1, and Leu2 for the two solvents. The DMSO/water structure resembles more closely the structure of microcystin-

Conformation of Microcystin-LR in Solution LR complexed with protein phosphatase-1. However, these structural differences appear not to affect the toxicity, since this part of the molecule is absent and substituted by 2-(Nmethylamino)-2-butenoic acid (Mdhb) in the equally toxic cyclic pentapeptide nodularin.
