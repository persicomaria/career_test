We investigated the soluble forms of the earliest activation antigen of human leukocyte CD69. This receptor is expressed at the cell surface as a type II homodimeric membrane protein. However, the elements necessary to prepare the soluble recombinant CD69 suitable for structural studies are a matter of controversy. We describe the physical, biochemical and in vivo characteristics of a highly stable soluble form of CD69 obtained by bacterial expression of an appropriate extracellular segment of this protein. Our construct has been derived from one used for CD69 crystallization by further optimization with regard to protein stability, solubility and easy crystallization under conditions promoting ligand binding. The resulting protein is stable at acidic pH and at temperatures of up to 65 °C, as revealed by long-term stability tests and thermal denaturation experiments. Protein NMR and crystallography confirmed the expected protein fold, and revealed additional details of the protein characteristics in solution. The soluble CD69 refolded in a form of noncovalent dimers, as revealed by gel filtration, sedimentation velocity measurements, NMR and dynamic light scattering. The soluble CD69 proved to be remarkably stable in vivo when injected into the bloodstream of experimental mice. More than 70% of the most stable CD69 proteins is preserved intact in the blood 24 h after injection, whereas the less stable CD69 variants are rapidly taken up by the liver.

CD69, an earliest activation antigen of lymphocytes and a versatile leukocyte signaling molecule, plays a key role in a large number of immune effector functions. This receptor is constitutively expressed at the

surface of CD3bright thymocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, epidermal Langerhans' cells and platelets, and appears very early upon the activation of T-lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and some other cells of

hematopoietic origin [1]. Biochemically, CD69 is a disulfide-linked homodimer with two constitutively phosphorylated and variously glycosylated polypeptides [2]. It belongs to the type II integral membrane proteins possessing an extracellular C-terminal protein motif related to C-type animal lectins [3­5]. Functional studies using a series of CD69 / CD23 chimeras clarified the role of individual protein segments in the biology of this receptor [6]. While the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are responsible for signaling and cellular expression, the `stalk' region of CD69 containing the dimerization Cys68 is important for the formation of homodimers and for proper surface expression [7,8]. CD69 is associated with G-proteins, and its rapid surface expression by transition from the intracellular stores can be induced by cellular activation or by heat shock, independently of new RNA and protein synthesis [9]. It has also been shown that in killer lymphocytes, such as cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, CD69 is important for the activation of cytotoxic functions [10] and forms a part of the signalization network involving activating as well as inhibitory (e.g. CD94) receptors on these cells [11]. However, more recent studies using CD69 deficient mice revealed that this receptor may be important in the downregulation of the immune response, mostly through the production of the pleiotropic cytokine transforming growth factor-b [12]. Moreover, CD69) / ) mice that could not activate killer cells through an engagement of CD69 receptor were unexpectedly more resistant to experimentally induced tumors [13], probably due to the fact that activated killer lymphocytes were protected from apoptosis. From these experiments, a working hypothesis was proposed suggesting that cross-linking of CD69 on the surface of killer cells by tumor membrane bound ligands may cause hyperactivation of these cells, and their subsequent elimination by apoptosis or other mechanisms [12]. According to this concept, the inhibition of the above cross-linking by either soluble CD69 ligands, or by soluble CD69 receptors might protect CD69+ killer cells from apoptosis, and render them more available for killing of the tumors. Structural and biochemical studies have been performed to define the protein fold of soluble CD69, and to identify its physiological ligands that may become useful as potential modulators of many reactions in the immune system. The globular protein segment corresponding to the carbohydrate recognition domain of C-type lectins (Ser84 to Lys199) mediates the binding of most monoclonal antibodies used for receptor crosslinking. Moreover, this region, which is able to function independently of the rest of CD69 receptor, is
5590

assumed to bind physiological ligands [6]. The structure of this part of the molecule has been solved by protein crystallography [14,15] in the crystallized CD69 dimers, and shown to consist of the compact C-type lectin fold stabilized by three disulfides. Two soluble recombinant protein forms used in structural studies and additional forms used previously for ligand identification [8,16­18] comprise potential candidates for testing their immunological activities. In the present study, we report the results of our physicochemical, biochemical and biological studies of soluble CD69 receptors, which show remarkable in vitro and in vivo stability that is compatible with their potential use for therapeutical applications.

Results
Design and optimization of the expression construct for soluble CD69 Previous studies using soluble CD69 receptors (for amino acid sequence, see Fig. 1A) have provided some insight into the elements necessary for the stability of these proteins. These studies have emphasized the limited stability of the `short carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD)' construct compared to the `long CRD' variant, and supported the importance of Cys68 for the formation of covalent CD69 dimers [8­13]. We decided to investigate these features systematically, and produced four different expression constructs, starting with Gln65, Gly70, Val82 and Ser84, designated CD69CQ65, CD69NG70, CD69NV82 and CD69NS84, respectively (Fig. 1A). Only the protein expressed from the first construct contains the interchain dimerization cysteine Cys68, thus predisposing it to occur as a covalent dimer (CD69C). Despite previously published work on the production of disulfide-dimerized soluble CD69 [16], only a very limited amount of this protein could be produced after on-column refolding, removal of the histidine tag and reverse phase separation. SDS / PAGE under nonreducing and reducing conditions (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively), as well as MS-ESI (Fig. 1C), confirmed the expected characteristics of the protein. It was observed that, from the remaining three human proteins predicted to occur as monomers or noncovalent dimers (CD69N), the longest construct containing an extended stalk region starting with Gly70 (i.e. CD69NG70) displayed a number of interesting characteristics, even if its initial production using Protocol I led to some problems. Proteins prepared using this protocol appeared homogenous by

SDS / PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1C, lane 5), whereas there was a notable shift in mobility under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1C, lane 4), most probably because of the more compact arrangements of the protein subunits cross-linked by three disulfide bridges. When examined by high resolution FT-ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) MS, the protein displayed a notable degradation of the N-terminal part of its stalk region as shown by a clear ladder of the degradation products that stopped only at Val82 (Fig. 1D). However, by employing an alternative purification protocol (Proto-

col II), much more stable preparations predominantly displaying the expected molecular peak at m / z 15119 could be obtained (Fig. 1E). The latter molecular form represents the one expected for the protein sequence with the initiation methionine removed, and all three disulfide bonds closed. The complete removal of the initiation methionine during prokaryotic protein production was also confirmed by extensive N-terminal sequencing (up to 45 cycles of automated Edman degradation performed with reduced protein having the cysteine residues modified by acrylamide).

For the last two constructs (CD69NV82 and CD69NS84), homogenous proteins displaying similar molecular characteristics could be prepared in high yield and purity (Fig. 1C, lanes 6­9). High resolution FT-ICR mass spectra of these proteins were very similar and the results for CD69NV82 are shown in Fig. 1F. No extensive N-terminal degradation occurred in these proteins and the minor heterogeneity observed may be assigned to the incomplete removal of the initiation methionine from these proteins during recombinant production. CD69NG70 has unusual solubility and stability To assess the solubility and stability of the recombinant preparations of CD69, we concentrated both CD69NG70 and CD69NV82 using a Centricon 10 device, and were able to confirm their very high solubility. Both protein preparations could be concentrated up to 40 mgÆmL)1 without any signs of precipitation or aggregation (these experiments could not be performed with CD69CQ65 and CD69NS84 because of the limited amounts of material available). To further evaluate the stability of CD69 preparations, we performed thermal denaturation experiments using UV spectroscopy. Upon protein unfolding, many aromatic amino acids forming the protein core become exposed with the concomitant increase in the molar extinction coefficient of the protein, and thus the increase in absorbance in the aromatic region. Shortly thereafter, a gradual unfolding of the protein occurs that results in the increase of turbidity, aggregation and precipitation. Interestingly, when CD69NG70 was tested at moderately high concentration (0.5 mgÆmL)1) in standard Mes buffer at pH 5.8, it displayed unusually high temperature stability, and no unfolding of the protein could be seen, even after 1 h of incubation at temperatures as high as 60 °C (Fig. 2A). To verify the critical role of disulfide bridges in this thermal stability, we performed similar experiments in the presence of dithiothreitol. Exploratory studies employing the mobility shift of the oxidized form in SDS gels revealed that at least 3 mm dithiothreitol is required for a complete and quantitative breakage of all three disulfides in CD69 (results not shown). The addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol during the thermal denaturation experiment indeed caused a significant reduction in the thermal stability with notable unfolding starting already at 44 °C (Fig. 2B). The disulfide-independent unfolding of the protein is also a function of the pH of the reaction buffer and is higher in the alkaline environment. Thus, the unfolding temperatures at pH 6.8 or 7.8 were found to be 40 °C and 30 °C,
5592

respectively (Fig. 2C and data not shown). On the other hand, the protein is very stable in the acidic environment and is not denatured or precipitated, even at pH 2.0 in the presence of 40% acetonitrile (i.e. the conditions used during its purification on the reversed phase column). FTIR spectroscopy represents an alternative method for looking at the thermal stability of CD69 proteins because the changes in the amide I and II bands (Fig. 2D) are sensitive indicators of the change in contents of the individual secondary structure elements. This metodology was therefore employed to investigate the stability of the produced proteins under thermal and pH stress. The content of secondary structure elements upon heating remained constant up until 5 °C below the temperature of denaturation (Td) determined by differential scanning calorimetry, when the peripheral a-helices started to unfold, and there were less b-turns in some instances (see Table S1). To examine the stability under pH stress, the content of secondary structure elements was measured in buffers with different pH at temperatures set to 5 °C below the Td. Most of the studied proteins retain their structure under a broad range of pH, except the alkaline (pH 9.0), where they are less stable, in particular CD69NV82 and CD69NS84 (Table S2). Taken together, these investigations support the hierarchy of stability of soluble CD69 proteins in which the somewhat longer proteins (CD69QC65, CD69NG70) appear to be more stable than the shortened ones. We routinely maintain the stocks of soluble CD69 concentrated to 10 mgÆmL)1 in moderately acidic buffers [10 mm Mes (pH 5.8), with 49 mm NaCl and 1 mm NaN3] at both 4 °C and 24 °C. Under these conditions of storage, we could not observe any signs of precipitation or biochemical degradation, even after several months. Addition of common salts containing monovalent ions (NaCl, or KCl, up to 1 m concentrations) appeared to have little influence on the stability of the protein. Also, the use of several other common protein stabilizers (mannitol, glycerol, non-ionic detergents) had very little effect on protein stability. From several bivalent ions tested, calcium ion (Ca2+) was the only one with a moderate stabilizing effect. For example, if the stability experiment described in Fig. 2B was performed in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2, the initial unfolding temperature was increased by approximately 2 °C (data not shown). However, calcium bound to CD69 during refolding does not dissociate from the protein at pH up to 5.5, and the protein decalcified in acidic environment can be easily recalcified upon the addition of the external calcium (results not shown).

(1 mgÆmL)1 of protein in 10 mm Mes buffer, pH 5.8), the degradation of the protein depends solely on the production protocol, and thus probably reflects the purity of the final product. For example, as already

mentioned, CD69NG70 prepared using Protocol I is degraded by approximately 50% to its lower molecular mass variant, CD69NV82, after 3 days at 37 °C (Fig. 2E). However, the same protein purified using Protocol II is completely stable under these conditions (Fig. 2F). A summary of all the protein stability data for the four different protein variants under study is provided in Table 1. It is evident that, when purified using Protocol II, CD69NG70 is the best protein from the point of view of both its physical and long-term stability. Protein CD69CQ65 displays an exceptional physical stability upon heating up to 67 °C but it has a much lower long-term biochemical stability. Interestingly, the stability of the short proteins CD69NV82 and CD69NS84 is much lower using these criteria, both from the point of view of their physical stability upon heating and their biochemical stability. CD69NG70 is a monodisperse, compactly folded protein Considering the protein stability results as well as the practical aspects such as production yield and complexity of the purification protocol, CD69NG70 appeared to be the best candidate for the stable soluble form of human CD69. To prove its correct fold, we applied NMR analysis as well as protein crystallography. We produced CD69NG70 in bacteria growing on minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source and purified the uniformly labeled protein (> 95% as judged by FT-ICR MS). The 1H-15NHSQC spectrum of 0.3 mm solution of this protein is shown in Fig. 3A indicating good dispersion of the backbone and side-chain signals (the latter including those assigned to tryptophane indole groups in the

6 months, essentially identical results were obtained, again pointing to the high stability of the protein preparation. Even spectra measured using several different batches of the protein looked very similar (data not shown), indicating reproducibility of the refolding and purification protocol. The crystallization of CD69 has been until now performed in weakly acidic environment (pH of around 4.0) [14,15], supporting both the stability of the protein and its efficient crystallization. At the same time, these conditions prevent the binding of ligands to CD69 because most suggested ligands are at least halfdissociated, even at a slightly acidic pH of around 5.5 [17]. The major incentive of the present study was an attempt to crystallize soluble CD69 in buffers with neutral or slightly alkaline pH under conditions compatible with binding of potential ligands. We succeeded in crystallizing the very stable CD69NG70 protein using l-arginine hydrochloride as buffer and stabilizing agent at pH 7.0 (Fig. 3B). However, in our crystallization trials, we found that attempts to crystallize either the longer CD69CQ65, corresponding to the one used by Natarajan et al. [14], or the shorter protein CD69NV92, identical to that used previously by Llera et al. [15], produced only small crystals of insufficient quality. The solved structure provided a classical C-type lectin-like protein fold composed of two a-helices and three b-sheets in which the first 11 N-terminal amino acids were not structurally ordered possibly due to their flexibility (see below). CD69NG70 formed noncovalent dimers structurally ordered into the hexagonal crystal lattice. A single dimer can be roughly described as an ellipsoid with three axes extending to 7, 3.8 and 3.1 nm (including the solvation shell), thus indicating the very compact folding of the polypeptide chain (Fig. 3B). The dimer interface is built by short intermolecular b-sheet and hydrophobic aromatic side chains. Both overall fold and dimer arrangement are identical to those described previously [14,15]. NMR 15N relaxation measurements were performed to monitor flexibility of the CD69NG70 backbone. To interpret the data, resonance frequencies of the backbone amides were assigned as described in the Experimental procedures. Chemical shifts of alpha and beta carbons and of backbone amide protons and nitrogens were deposited together with the measured relaxation data in the BioMagResBank (http:// www.bmrb.wisc.edu) under Accession No. 15703. The obtained assignment covered 77% of the sequence, with most of the unassigned residues between Glu87 and Phe98. Order parameters calculated from the relaxation data (Fig. 4D) revealed a low flexibility of

most residues, with the exception of the N-terminal region, where the order parameter gradually decreased from 0.75 (Val82) to 0.08 (Phe74). This finding is in agreement with the X-ray structure where the residues Gly70 to His81 are missing as disordered. Because we were interested in co-crystallization of CD69 with its low molecular weight ligands suggested previously [17] in the crystal structure, calcium chloride was added both to the protein and precipitant solution (see Experimental procedures). Based on anomalous Fourier, three structurally ordered anomalously contributing atoms were located in the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure of CD69 (the asymmetric unit comprises one dimer of CD69 and three Cl) anions). Every monomer binds two Cl­ anions, one in a shallow pocket at the side of the molecule and the second one forming crystal contact with a neighboring dimer in the crystal structure (Fig. 3B,C). Neither of these two binding sites resembled the well-known calcium binding site for classical C-type lectins (such as the mannose binding protein) or the site predicted from our calcium binding data and computer docking experiments [17]. Furthermore, the amino acid neighbourhood of these ions (Ser, Thr, Val, Tyr, Lys) and their distances from the nearest ° atoms (3.1­3.3 A) would be rather atypical for the calcium cation, but appropriate for the chloride anion, which has approximately the same intensity of anomalous scattering signal. We therefore assigned these three ions to chlorides. We also tried to crystallize CD69 in presence of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (in concentrations in the range 1 mm to 1 m), as well as several branched oligosaccharide structures based on GlcNAc that were available in our laboratory [18]. Despite the fact that we were able to collect high resolution data for most of these co-crystals (a total of eight complete datasets with ° resolution 1.8­2.2 A), we could not observe any extra electron density corresponding to these potential ligands (data not shown). The crystal structure with best resolution was selected for deposition (accession number Protein Databank code 3CCK). Examination of the native size of soluble CD69 Because the crystals of CD69NG70 contained molecules packed as noncovalent dimers, we were interested to determine the native size and the monodispersity of the protein in solution. Gel filtration with a Superdex 200 column used for the final purification of the monodisperse proteins strongly suggested that all four proteins examined elute exclusively as dimers (Fig. 4A).

Fig. 4. Estimation of the native size of soluble CD69. (A) The native size of the four different soluble CD69 proteins was determined by gel filtration using a Superdex 200HR column (GE HealthCare) equilibrated in Mes buffer and eluted at 0.4 mLÆmin)1. From top to bottom: CD69NS84 (blue), CD69NV82 (yellow), CD69NG70 (green) and CD69CQ65 (red). (B) Two hundred microlitres of 0.3 mM solution of CD69NG70 was applied onto the sucrose linear gradient (5­20% sucrose in Mes buffer, pH 5.8) and spun at 392 000 gav. and 30 °C in a SW-60 rotor (Beckman Coulter). In the initial experiment, the optimal time for the separation of the protein markers ovalbumine (44 kDa) and lysozyme (14 kDa) was found to be 15 h. The mobility of CD69NG70 separated under the same conditions, and also in the presence of 0.5% detergents (SDS, Chaps, octyl glucoside or lauryl maltoside, respectively), is shown in the corresponding lanes. (C) Sedimentation velocity measurement. The dialyzed sample was spun at 130 000 gav. and individual scans were recorded at 5 min intervals. (D) Apparent values of rotational diffusion coefficient, obtained from NMR 15N relaxation data fitted separately for each residue (red crosses), are compared with the apparent mean rotational diffusion coefficients calculated by the software HYDRONMR for monomeric (green circles) and dimeric (blue triangles) CD69 structures. Triangles (up and down) distinguish subunits of the dimer; small symbols and light colors refer to individual structures of ensembles with the disordered N-terminal region modeled. (E) DLS measurements were performed as described in the Experimental procedures.

To investigate further the stability and the native size of CD69NG70, we employed hydrodynamic studies, protein NMR and light scattering experiments. When we sedimented CD69NG70 in sucrose density gradients in a preparative ultracentrifuge, it appeared as a single species with a mobility between that of ovalbumin (45 kDa) and lysozyme (14 kDa) (Fig. 4B). Moreover, we used the conditions of this experiment to investigate the chemical factors affecting the dimeric arrangement. The addition of non-ionic detergents such as CHAPS, octyl glucoside or lauryl maltoside did not change the sedimentation behavior of the soluble CD69 receptor but incubation in the presence of the anionic detergent SDS under mild conditions was able
5596

to cause dissociation of the dimer into single subunits (Fig. 4B). The single separated subunit remained folded under these experimental conditions because the totally unfolded CD69 obtained by boiling in the identical SDS concentration remained at the top of the centrifugation cuvette (not shown). Moreover, monomeric CD69 subunits remained stable for up to 1 week when stored at 4 °C, displaying an identical sedimentation as in the original experiment. However, upon heating to room temperature, these subunits unfolded with a half-time of several hours, as shown by additional sedimentation analyses not presented here. Additional experimental techniques confirmed that both CD69NG70 and CD69NV82 are present

exclusively as noncovalent dimers (under the experimental conditions used). Sedimentation velocity measurements (Fig. 4C) in the analytical ultracentrifuge (AUC) provided a value of sedimentation coefficient of 3.51 ± 0.03 S for CD69NG70. When these values were used for molecular mass calculation, a value 30 kDa was obtained, which corresponded very well to the expected mass for the dimer (30.2 kDa). The corresponding values for the CD69NV82 protein were 2.95 ± 0.04 S, and the calculated molecular mass was 27 kDa, again very close to the calculated molecular mass of the dimer (27.5 kDa). The results obtained using sedimentation equilibrium were very similar (data not shown). Moreover, the apparent values of the overall correlation time derived from NMR relaxation measurements (Fig. 4D, see below) are compatible with the dimeric arrangement. Finally, dynamic light scattering (DLS), a modern, fast and versatile experimental technique, confirmed the monodispersity of the CD69 preparation (Fig. 4E), and provided an additional estimation for several of the molecular parameters measured by the previous techniques. These included the radius of gyration [r = 1.91 nm (crystallography) and 2.04 nm (DLS)], the translational diffusion coefficient [D = 8.53 · 10)7 cm2Æs)1 (AUC) and 8.47 · 10)7 cm2Æs)1 (DLS)], the rotational diffusion coefficient [Dr = 12 · 106 s)1 (NMR relaxation, see below) and 9.36 · 106 s)1 (DLS)], and the sedimentation coefficient [s = 3.51 S (AUC) and 3.02 S (DLS)]. A more detailed picture of the rotational diffusion was derived from the NMR 15N relaxation data. To monitor the effect of the real shape of the molecule on its tumbling, the values of the apparent rotational diffusion coefficient Dr were evaluated for each residue not effected by spectral overlap or slow conformational exchange as described in the Experimental procedures. The apparent Dr values were compared with the values predicted from hydrodynamic calculations of several molecules, including the crystal dimer, its monomeric subunit, and sets of dimeric and monomeric structures with the disordered N-terminal tail modeled in various conformations (Fig. 4D). The comparison clearly showed that largely overestimated Dr values were predicted for the monomeric structures, including those with the N-terminal residues added. On the other hand, values predicted for the X-ray dimer structure closely matched the data obtained form NMR 15N relaxation for the wellordered portion of the protein. The experimental Dr values for the N-terminal residues deviated from the average apparent Dr, estimated for the rigid core of the protein, and from the values predicted by the rigid-body hydrodynamic calculations. This indicates

that motions of the disordered N-terminal residues are largely independent and have a little effect on the rotational diffusion of the well-ordered portion of the protein. In conclusion, NMR 15N relaxation combined with hydrodynamic calculations demonstrated the presence of the dimer. Somewhat higher apparent Dr values (approximately 12 · 106 s)1) compared to those obtained from DLS (see above) reflect the fact that tumbling of the rigid portion of the protein is largely independent of the motions of the disordered N-terminal tail. Production of soluble rat and mouse CD69 For in vivo stability studies in mice, it was desirable to compare the properties of the variant soluble human CD69 proteins with the corresponding rat and mouse orthologs [18,19] that are more compatible with the experimental model used. Therefore, we prepared the corresponding soluble rat and mouse CD69 proteins using the expression constructs having an extended `stalk' similar to that found in the most stable human CD69, CD69NG70. Thus, in the expression constructs used, there were 15 amino acids before the first cysteine residue defining the `long' CRD in the human CD69NG70 protein, whereas there were 12 and 15 amino acid residues in the corresponding rat and mouse orthologs, respectively. The rat and mouse CD69 refolded and purified efficiently, giving rise to homogenous proteins on SDS / PAGE (Fig. 1B, lanes 10­13). Moreover, the physical and biochemical stability of the three proteins also appeared to be comparable (Table 1; see also Supporting information, Tables S1 and S2). Interestingly, although the mouse CD69 appeared to form noncovalent dimers similar to human CD69, the rat CD69 protein appeared to be monomeric [18] (Table 1). Stability of soluble CD69 preparations in vivo To assess the suitability of soluble CD69 preparations for in vivo therapeutic applications, we radioiodinated these proteins and followed the plasma clearance of these proteins. When injected into the bloodstream of C57BL / 6 mice, three of the soluble proteins (CD69CQ65, CD69NG70 and CD69NV82) displayed a prolonged circulation. After the initial dilution caused by binding and retaining in the tissues, the blood level of these proteins stabilized within 4 h, and then remained nearly unchanged for up to 24 h after injection (Fig. 5A). The circulation half-life for these proteins (approximately 40 h) is comparable to that of the endogenous serum proteins (Table 2). Moreover,

graphy, very little degradation could be seen for these proteins (Fig. 5B). Only the shortest soluble CD69 protein, CD69NS84, was quickly eliminated from the circulation with half-life of approximately 1.4 h (Table 2) concomitantly with the disappearance of this protein (Fig. 5A,B). Both the rat and the mouse CD69 exhibited a prolonged circulation in the blood of mice, which was comparable with the most stable human CD69, CD69NG70 (Fig. 5A), and remained intact and circulating in the blood for up to 24 h (Fig. 5B). Western blot analyses of CD69 proteins extracted from the serum of experimental mice using antibodies recognizing conformation sensitive epitopes on CD69 proteins provide further evidence for the long-term stability of the above mentioned preparations (Fig. 5B). Finally, the best evidence for good in vivo stability is provided by the rapid GlcNAc binding test indicating that even the biological (carbohydrate binding) activity of soluble CD69 proteins was preserved under these conditions (Table 3). Upon killing of the mice 24 h after the injection of the proteins, we collected the most important organs and body fluids for scintillation counting. Interestingly, only approximately 10% of the initial radioactivity was recovered outside the animals, and could be found in urine and faeces (Fig. 6A,B). Otherwise, there were only two major compartments that together accounted for 60­70% of the injected radioactivity, namely liver and blood. The distribution of CD69 radioactivity between these two compartments appeared to be reciprocal. Thus, for long-circulating proteins such as human CD69NG70, and rat and mouse CD69, up to 40% of the injected radioactivity could be recovered in the blood 24 h after injection, whereas the liver took up approximately 20% of the initial dose. On the other hand, CD69NS84, which could serve as an example of a protein rapidly cleared from the blood (Fig. 5A), was taken up predominantly by the liver, which accumulated more than 60% of the initial dose

Discussion
Although several soluble CD69 proteins have previously been described in the literature by our group [8,17,18], as well as in other studies [14­16], the physical, biochemical and in vivo stabilities of these proteins have not been systematically studied. In the present study, we describe a detailed structure stability investigation of soluble human CD69 receptor using a series of N-terminal deletions. Previous results have demonstrated the critical importance of this N-terminal `stalk' region and of the three disulfide bonds for CD69 stability [8,16]. However, we now report seminal findings that argue for the importance of the `extended stalk' region starting just after the dimerization cysteine Cys68, where a short sequence of 11 amino acids (Gly70-His81) appeared to be particularly critical. This short peptide segment is not structurally organized, as shown by a lack of corresponding signals in all the available crystal structures of CD69, as well as by the high mobility of these residues in the NMR relaxation experiments. Yet, despite being structurally unordered, this segment contributes significantly to the physical and biochemical stability of the soluble CD69 receptors, promotes efficiently the formation of noncovalent dimers during in vitro refolding, and allows the crystallization of the corresponding protein under conditions compatible with the binding of ligands. Soluble CD69 expressed as covalently linked dimeric protein appeared to be physically even more stable but, on the other hand, posed a number of disadvantages, including a complicated production strategy, difficult purification and low yields. On the other hand, the noncovalent dimeric CD69NG70 protein can be easily purified in high yields (10 mgÆL)1 of bacterial culture) over a period of 2­3 days using the commonly available equipment in an average biochemical laboratory. CD69NG70 was therefore selected as the best candidate for the stable and easily available form of soluble CD69 receptor displaying remarkable long-term stability. The biochemical stability of this preparation was even better than that for CD69CQ65 expressed as a covalent dimer, and was superior to that of the shorter proteins CD69NV82 and CD69NS84. In particular, the latter protein, although being just two amino acids shorter, displayed a significantly reduced stability. This corresponds well with our previous findings showing that further reduction of this protein in this area, and particularly the removal of the amino acids forming the third stalk disulfide bridge, is detrimental to the stability of such soluble CD69 proteins [17,18]. The exceptional stability of CD69NG70 is most probably related to its dimeric arrangement, which has

been demonstrated by a number of experimental techniques, including gel filtration, sedimentation velocity analysis, measurement of NMR relaxations and DLS. Our studies attempting to dissociate the dimer in SDS under mild conditions provided further support for such a conclusion. It would appear from these experiments that single globular carbohydrate-recognition domains of CD69, even when stabilized by detergent at the disrupted dimer interface, comprise short-lived molecules that are only moderately stable at low temperatures (4 °C) and start to unfold when heated to ambient temperature. However, the general validity of this conclusion appears to be challenged by the data for rat CD69, which appears to be monomeric. The remarkable in vitro stability of the human soluble CD69 receptor, CD69NG70 protein, makes it a strong candidate for a protein that is potentially useful for therapeutic purposes. Therefore, it was critical to test the in vivo stability of this protein and to compare it with the stability of its rat and mouse orthologs that are more compatible with the experimental models in use. The results of these tests revealed both the long circulation and the intactness of the most stable human CD69 protein (together with its rat and mouse orthologs) in the blood of mice. For these proteins, approximately 40% of the initial dose could be still recovered 24 h after injection. Moreover, the exclusion of the protein in urine and faeces, and uptake by the liver, was relatively low. On the other hand, the least stable human CD69NS84 protein displayed a rapid plasma clearance connected with the transfer into the liver that took up more than 60% of the injected dose. Progress in our knowledge of CD69 biology has advanced rapidly, allowing to propose the individual therapeutic modalities involving the stable soluble CD69 receptors described in the present study. One such protocol may involve the reactivity of the soluble long cirulating CD69 protein with the tumor surface ligands, leading to their blocking or reduced availability for the reaction with the cellular form of CD69 at the surface of the killer lymphocytes. This should result in the protection of these critical cells of antitumor immunity from apoptotic cell death following their hyperactivation by tumor surface ligands [12]. Such a possibility is further supported by recent results obtained by our group as well as in studies by others [20­23]. We have recently shown that mimetics of tumor surface ligands for CD69, when presented in a highly multivalent form, can bind strongly to CD69+ lymphocytes and cause their death by a massive trigger of apoptosis. Graham et al. [20] recently reported that hyperstimulation of human T lymphocytes with ligands
5600

for CD28 or integrins results in their activation, as demonstrated by high surface expression of CD69, and massive cell death. North et al. [22] recently described NK cells that, when primed by incubation with the tumors, acquire the ability to lyse leukemic cell lines and even solid tumors primarily through CD69 receptors, as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit such lysis with soluble recombinant CD69 protein. These results appear to be supported by our histochemical evidence showing that tumor infiltrating lymphocytes significantly upregulate CD69 expression [21]. An increased occurrence of CD69 positive lymphocytes in tumor sites may also be related to its recently described function as a downregulator of lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs due to the downmodulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 [23]. Konjevic et al. [24] reported the predictive value of CD69 expression during the clinical response to chemoimmunotherapy in patients with metastatic melanomas. Collectively, these results appear to support the role of CD69 as one of critical receptors involved in the recognition and killing of tumors, including clinically important solid tumors. In view of all these results, the availability of long-circulating and in vivo stable soluble CD69 proteins with a low toxicity for experimental animals would be an advantage for their use in experimental tumor therapy models using rats or mice [21]. In conclusion, our systematic studies of soluble CD69 receptors that have been refolded in the form of covalent or noncovalent dimers demonstrate large variation in the solubility and stability among these proteins and allow us to select the human protein containing amino acids Gly70 to Lys199 (and the rat and mouse orthologs) as the most physically and biochemically stable variant. We have proven an exceptional in vivo stability and low toxicity upon injection into the blood of experimental mice in which these proteins remain intact for the prolonged periods of time necessary to elicit their therapeutic effects in our animal tumor therapy models [21]. The availability of such soluble CD69 receptors now opens the way for their testing in various animal experimental models of CD69 related diseases, such as malignant or autoimmune diseases.

the entire extracellular part of the CD69 was described previously [8].

Expression and purification of recombinant soluble human CD69 receptors
For the production of the covalent dimeric CD69, CD69CQ65, an expression plasmid similar to that described previously [16] was used. DNA was amplified using forward primer 5¢-CTCGAGACAATACAATTGTCCAGG-3¢, and reverse primer 5¢-ACAAAGCTTATTTGTAAGGTTTGTT ACA-3¢, and the PCR product was cloned into pBSK+ vector using the SmaI restriction site, and then into pRSETB vector using XhoI and HindIII restriction endonucleases. His-Tag was removed using mild tryptic digestion targeted to the two basic amino acids (Arg coded by the XhoI site was followed immediately by CD69 sequence Lys) preceding Gln65. For the production of soluble CD69 refolded as noncovalent dimers, three different DNA fragments coding for the extracellular portion of human CD69 were amplified by PCR using Deep Vent DNA polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) as the amplification enzyme, pCDA401 as a template and the following primer pairs: for CD69NG70, 5¢-ACATATGGGCCAATACACATTC-3¢ and 5¢-ACAAAGCTTATTTGTAAGGTTTGTTACA-3¢; for CD69NV82, 5¢-ACATATGGTTTCTTCATGCTCTG-3¢ and 5¢- ACAAAGCTTATTTGTAAGGTTTGTTACA-3¢; and for CD69NS84, 5¢-ACATATGTCATGCTCTGAGGACTGG GTT-3¢ and 5¢- ACAAAGCTTATTTGTAAGGTTTGTT ACA-3¢. PCR products were directly cloned into pBSK+ cloning vector (Stratagene, LaJolla, CA, USA) using the SmaI restriction site and the desired expression constructs were subsequently cloned into pRSETB expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) using the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites introduced by the amplification primers. Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) RIL or Gold strains (Stratagene). Bacteria were grown in 2 L Erlenmeyer flasks with 0.5 L of LB broth at 37 °C with ampicillin and tetracycline (Gold) or chloramphenicol (RIL) as antibiotics. Induction of protein production with isopropyl thio-b-d-galactoside was not necessary, and the culture was left to grow for 16­24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and inclusion bodies were isolated [25]. Inclusion bodies were dissolved in 50 mm Tris­ HCl (pH 8.0) with 6 m guanidine-HCl and 100 mm dithithreitol, centrifuged, and adjusted to 10 mgÆmL)1 protein. In vitro refolding of denatured protein was carried out by rapid dilution into the refolding buffer. Clarified protein solution was quickly diluted 100-fold into the refolding buffer composed of 50 mm Tris­HCl (pH 8.5), 0.4 m l-arginine, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaN3, 18 mm cysteamine, 1 mm cystamine, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 lgÆmL)1 leupeptine and 1 lgÆmL)1 pepstatine. After slow stirring at 4 °C for 5 h, the refolding mixture was dialyzed against 8 L

of 10 mm Tris­HCl (pH 8.5), 0.5 m NaCl and 1 mm NaN3 for 6 h, and then against 10 L of 10 mm Tris­HCl (pH 8.5), 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm NaN3 for 12 h at 4 °C. Two protocols were used further. In Protocol I, protease inhibitors were added to the dialyzed protein, and the pH of the solution was adjusted with acetic acid to 5.5. The insoluble precipitate of misfolded protein was centrifuged at 20 000 g for 30 min at room temperature. The refolded CD69 protein was then captured on SP-Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare Europe, Munich, Germany) equilibrated in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5), 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm NaN3. The column was eluted by linear gradient of NaCl from 50 mm to 2 m. Fractions containing CD69 protein were pooled and applied onto a reverse phase column Vydac C4 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid as mobile phase A and eluted by linear gradient of mobile phase B composed of 95% acetonitrile and 5% of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid from 30% to 40% B over 60 min. Concentrated fractions were further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR 10 / 30 column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mm Mes (pH 5.8) with 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm NaN3, and concentrated to 10 mgÆmL)1 using a Centriprep and Centricon device (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). In Protocol II, dialyzed protein without any acidification was passed through Q-Sepharose FF column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The protein passed through the column, and was concentrated by ultrafiltration using PLGC regenerated cellulose membranes (Millipore) with a 10 kDa cut-off. The concentrated protein was finally purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR 10 / 30 column, and concentrated as described in Protocol I. The preparation and analysis of rat CD69 has been described previously [18]. DNA fragment coding for mouse CD69 [5,19] was amplified from RNA prepared from spleens of C57BL / 6 mice using RT-PCR with the forward primer 5¢-TGCATATGGGCCTTTACGAGAAGTTGGAA-3¢ containing the NdeI cloning site and the reverse primer 5¢-TGA AGCTTCATTATCTGGAGGGCTTGCTGCA-3¢ containing the HindIII site. The amplified NdeI­HindIII fragment was transferred into the pRSETB expression vector, and the protein was produced as described above, and purified using Protocol II.

Characterization of the purified soluble proteins
The identity of the prepared protein was confirmed by sequence mapping of tryptic digests with MALDI-TOF MS with a good sequence coverage. The total mass of the protein was measured by means of FT-ICR MS. The size distribution and polydispersity of human CD69 preparation were assessed by DLS at a concentration of 2 mgÆmL)1 in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) with 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm NaN3. Samples were loaded into a 45 lL quartz cuvette and particle size distribution measurements were performed

repeatedly at 291 K using a Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Estimates of hydrodynamic radii of the expected molecular species were calculated with the software hydropro [26]. The structures of monomers and dimers of the human CD69 in the present study, and as reported previously [15] (Protein Databank code 1E87), were used as input coordinates for the calculations. The dimer of hCD69 in the Protein Databank record 1E87 was generated using symmetry operators. Calculated Stokes radii were compared with experimental values.

Protein crystallography and data collection
Recombinant human CD69 was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion method using 24-well plates (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA). Initial crystallization conditions were established at 291 K using selected precipitants from JBScreen kits (Jena Bioscience, Jena, Germany). Each drop was prepared by mixing equal volumes (1 lL) of the protein and the precipitant solution and each drop was equilibrated against 1 mL of precipitant solution. After optimization of poly(ethylene glycol) molecular weight and concentration, and after exchange of precipitant buffer, we determined the suitable crystallization conditions. Needleshaped, but regular crystals were obtained by mixing 1 lL of protein at a concentration of 5 mgÆmL)1 in 10 mm BisTris­HCl (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm NaN3 with 1 lL of reservoir solution containing 0.1 m Arginine.HCl (pH 7.0), 20% PEG 3400, 10 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm NaN3. Crystals appeared within 1 week. For X-ray data collection, crystals were mounted in nylon loops and cryoprotected by soaking in the reservoir solution containing 25% glycerol as a cryoprotectant and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The dataset was collected at 100 K at beamline 19-ID of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL, USA). The diffraction data were processed using the hkl-3000 software suite [27] (Table 4). The structure was ° first determined to 4.0 A resolution by molecular replacement. A search model constructed from the crystal structure of CD69 (Protein Databank code 1E8I) [15] was used for the simultaneous rotation and translation search of two molecules by the software epmr [28]. The search yielded an unambiguous solution in the P61 space group with an initial Rcrys of 42.2% and a correlation coefficient of 0.57. In the rigid body refinement, both molecules of the dimer were allowed to move independently. During the restrained refinement procedure, noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied to the CD69 monomers. Rigid body refinement and subsequent restrained refinement protocol were performed with the software refmac 5.1.24 [29] from the ccp4 package [30]. For manual model rebuilding, the software coot was used [31]. The structure was refined to a ° crystallographic R-factor of 19.0% at 1.8 A resolution. Further refinement statistics are shown in Table 4.

Structure coordinates
The coordinates and structure factors have been submitted to the RCSB Protein Databank under accession code 3CCK.

Thermal denaturation experiments
Recombinant proteins were diluted to 0.5 mgÆmL)1, and UV spectra were taken in the 200­300 nm range in Beckman DU-70 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) equipped with the heated cuvette. The initial UV scan was taken at 25 °C, after which the temperature in the cuvette was increased in 5 °C increments up to the denaturation temperature indicated by sudden increase in the absorbance. The experiment was performed in 10 mm Mes (pH 5.8) with 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm NaN3, in the same buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, and also in 10 mm Pipes buffer (pH 6.8) with 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3 and 5 mm dithiothreitol, and in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.8) with 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3 and 5 mm dithiothreitol. From the complete spectra, only the absorbance at 280 nm was extracted and plotted because of technical difficulties with buffer subtraction in the far UV region. Alternatively, protein stability was followed using FTIR spectroscopy. Infrared spectra were recorded with a Bruker IFS-66 / S FTIR spectrometer (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) using a standard MIR source, a KBr beamsplitter and an MCT detector. Four thousand scans were collected with 4 cm)1

spectral resolution and a Happ­Genzel apodization function. Aqueous protein solution was measured at the indicated temperature in a thermostated CaF2-BioCell with 10 lm path length (BioTools, Jupiter, FL, USA). The spectral contribution of a buffer was corrected using the standard algorithm [32]. The spectrum of water vapors was subtracted and finally the spectrum was normalized. The fraction content of the secondary structure elements was calculated using the procedure contin with a set of 16 reference proteins [32].

consecutive absorbance scans were taken, one at the end of 18 h period, and another after additional 2 h. The equilibrium distribution from three different loading concentrations and up to three different rotor speeds (24 000, 14 000 and 7500 gav, respectively) were analyzed using the nonlinear curve fit algorithm in the software package supplied with the centrifuge [33].

NMR measurements
All NMR experiments were run at 300 K on Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with the cryogenic H / C / N TCI probehead. 1H-15N HSQC spectra were used as a routine check of protein folding and stability during the sample preparation; 0.9 mm 13C / 15N-labeled and 0.3 mm 15N-labeled CD69NG70 samples were used for the assignment and relaxation measurements, respectively. The sample buffer consisted of 10 mm Mes (pH 5.8), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3 and 10% D2O. The standard set of triple resonance experiments [34] and 13C / 15N-edited NOESY [35] were used to obtain sequential assignment. The assignment was confirmed by checking side-chain resonances of selected residues in the HCCH-TOCSY spectra [34]. The 15N T1, T2 and steady-state 1H-15N NOE experiments were run as described by Farrow et al. [36]. The T1 and T2 relaxation delays were sampled at 11, 56, 134, 235, 381, 560, 896, 1344 ms and 16, 31, 62, 94, 156, 219, 250, 406 ms, respectively. All spectra were processed using the software nmrpipe [37] and analyzed using the software sparky (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, sparky 3; University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA).

Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium measurements
Initial sedimentation measurements were performed in the preparative ultracentrifuge (Beckman Optima LE-80) using the discontinuous sucrose gradient [1 mL each of 40%, 30%, 20% and 10% sucrose in 10 mm Mes buffer (pH 5.8) with 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm NaN3] placed into the UltraClear polycarbonate tube (Beckman Coulter). The sucrose gradient was overlayed with 0.2 mL of protein samples (10 mgÆmL)1) that were spun in SW-60 rotor for 16 h at 392 000 gav. Then, 0.35 mL samples were collected from the top to the bottom of the tube, and the protein distribution was examined in 10 lL by 17.5% SDS / PAGE. Further sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed using an analytical ultracentrifuge ProteomeLabXL-I (Beckman Coulter) using (depending on the sample concentration) absorbance or laser interference optics and an An50Ti rotor. Before the experiment, 0.5 mL samples of recombinant CD69 were dialyzed for 20 h against 2 L of 10 mm Tris­HCl (pH 7.8) with 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm NaN3. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 130 000 gav using an Epon aluminium-filled centerpiece (Beckman Coulter). Sample (400 lL) and dialysate (450 lL) were loaded in the sample and reference cells, respectively. Absorbance scans were performed at 280 nm at 5 min intervals and 0.003 cm spatial resolution, and the data were analyzed by the second-moment method using the software provided by the manufacturer. The partial specific volume of CD69NG70 (0.73 mLÆg)1) was calculated using the software sednterp (http:// www.rasmb.bbri.org). The molecular mass of CD69NG70 was calculated using the approximation for the spherical molecules, as described previously by Lebowitz et al. [33], according to the formula: Ssphere ¼ 0:012ð½M 2=3 ð1 À mqÞ=m1=3 Þ: For sedimentation equilibrium experiments, the protein was examined at three different concentrations (0.8, 0.4 and 0.2 mgÆmL)1) in three different sample cuvettes placed into an An50Ti rotor. The rotor was spun at 130 000 gav for 2 h, followed by 24 000 gav for 18 h. Thereafter, two

Relaxation analysis and hydrodynamic calculations
The backbone amide dynamic parameters were derived in the spirit of the Lipari­Szabo model-free approach [38,39] using the software relax [40,41]. The apparent rotational diffusion coefficient (defined as 1 / 6sm, where sm is the overall correlation time) was fitted separately for each residue for the sake of comparison with the hydrodynamics simulations. The internuclear N-H distance of 0.102 nm and 15N chemical shift anisotropy of 160 p.p.m. were used. The hydrodynamic calculations were performed using software hydronmr [42]. Viscosity was set to 0.852 mPaÆs. Default effective radius (0.32 nm) and minibeads of six radii in the range 0.15­0.2 nm were used. The structural models were derived from the X-ray structure (Protein Databank code 3CCK). Coordinates of the dimeric and monomeric structures were taken directly from the Protein Databank file. In addition, sets of monomeric and dimeric full-length structures were modeled by adding 11 N-terminal residues and running short molecular dynamics simulations using the software cns 1.2. The atoms taken from the X-ray structure

were kept fixed during the simulation, whereas the added 11 N-terminal amino acids were restrained by the measured chemical shifts only. The simulation protocol consisted of a 15 ps high temperature (50 000 K) torsion dynamics run, two 15 ps cooling stages (the first one employing torsion dynamics, the second one employing cartesian dynamics) and gradient minimization. Out of 100 structures calculated for each set, 20 structures with the lowest energy were used in hydrodynamics calculations.

NMR data
NMR data were submitted to the BioMagResBank database with an accession number 15703.

Protein distribution in vivo
All animal experiments were approved by the Institute Ethical Committee and were performed in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 (86 / 609 / EEC). Recombinant proteins for animal studies were made free of lipopolysaccharide using polymyxin B resin (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), radiolabeled using Na125I (GE Healthcare) to a specific activity of 106 BqÆlg)1, and repurified by reverse phase chromatography to remove the noncovalently bound iodine. Ten micrograms of each radiolabeled protein was administred in 50 lL of NaCl / Pi into the tail vein of two male C57BL / 6 mice, aged 7­8 weeks old (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA) that had been accommodated for at least 2 weeks in the conventional housing facility. Blood samples (50 lL) were collected 1, 4, 10 and 24 h after the administration of radioactivity in view of our experience with the rapid effect of the ligands for these receptors on the immune system [21]. From each sample, 20 lL was mixed with 80 lL of 10 mm NH4Cl and after 1 h at room temperature to lyse the erythrocytes, was used for hemoglobin determination by direct spectrophotometry at 400 nm, and for radioactivity counting. From the remaining 30 lL of sample, the most abundant serum proteins were removed using IgY12 resin (Beckman Coulter), and two 10 lL aliquots of the remaining proteins were resolved by 15% SDS / PAGE, and the gels were exposed to the autoradiographic films Agfa CP-VB (Agfa-Gevaert, Mortsel, Belgium) with intensifying screens, or developed by western blotting using mouse monoclonal antibodies against human CD69 (BL-Ac / p26) [17], rat CD69 [5] and mouse CD69 (Invitrogen), and ECL detection (GE Healthcare). The remaining 10 lL of the clarified protein was used for the solid phase binding using GlcNAc agarose (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Plasma half-life was calculated using the formula: c = c0 · e(­kt), where c is the concentration at the indicated time, c0 is the initial concentration and k is the first order rate constant [43]. The calculation of the plasma clearance and the apparent volume of distribution was based on a

one-compartment kinetic model with instantaneous absorption according to the equation: CP = (D / Vd) · e(­CL / Vd)t, where CP is the plasma level at time t, CL is the clearance, D is the administered dose and Vd is the apparent volume of distribution [43]. For organ distribution studies, mice were killed 24 h after injection of the radiolabeled protein, individual organs (spleen, kidney, liver, muscle, skin) were collected, and dissolved completely (60 °C, 48 h) in NCS-II tissue solubilizer, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare) before scintillation counting. The difference between the total initial dose of radioactivity, and the sum of radioactivities recovered in the individual organs, and in the urine and faeces, was designated as the rest of the body (rest), consisting mostly of the bowel, heart, bones, brain and reproductive organs. Because all six mice were housed in a single cage during the experiment, the radioactivity recovered in urine and faeces represents the average value. In an alternative time course experiment, liver and kidney were collected after 1, 4, 10 and 24 h after injection, and processed as described above.
