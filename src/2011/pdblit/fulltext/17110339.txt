The Golgi apparatus: defining the identity of Golgi membranes
Sean Munro
The Golgi apparatus is a stack of compartments that serves as a central junction for membrane traffic, with carriers moving through the stack as well as arriving from, and departing toward, many other destinations in the cell. This requires that the different compartments in the Golgi recruit from the cytosol a distinct set of proteins to mediate accurate membrane traffic. This recruitment appears to reflect recognition of small GTPases of the Rab and Arf family, or of lipid species such as PtdIns(4)P and diacylglycerol, which provide a unique `identity' for each compartment. Recent work is starting to reveal the mechanisms by which these labile landmarks are generated in a spatially restricted manner on specific parts of the Golgi.

in different parts of the stack recruit distinct sets of coat proteins to form the various types of vesicles that return to the ER, move within the stack or mediate transport to other parts of the cell. In addition, the Golgi acts as an acceptor compartment for vesicles from the ER, vesicles moving between cisternae, and carriers returning from the endosomal system to recycle receptors and components of the trafficking machinery that have left the TGN. These carriers fuse with only a subset of cisternae, and it appears that soluble protein complexes and coiledcoil proteins are recruited to tether vesicles before fusion and hence provide some, if not all, of the specificity of membrane traffic [4]. Thus the Golgi represents a formidable organizational problem for the cell, with the different cisternae having to recruit different sets of cytosolic coats and vesicle tethering factors. Moreover, if the cisternae are maturing, then the pattern of recruitment must change rapidly in the 10­20 minutes in which the cisternae must traverse from cis to trans (a time inferred form the rate at which cargo traverses the stack in mammals). In those cases that are well understood, the recruitment of these peripheral membrane proteins reflects their recognition of activated GTPases of the Rab and Arf families, or of specific lipid species. This has lead to recent interest in how the correct pattern of spatial determinants is generated so as to define an `identity' for the different cisternae. This issue is likely to be important not only for membrane traffic, but also for other processes. For example, some peripheral membrane proteins are specifically targeted to the Golgi to deliver precursors for lipid biosynthesis [5]. In addition, there is growing evidence that several signal transduction events occur on Golgi membranes and are mediated by kinases and GTPases specifically recruited from the cytoplasm. In this review I will discuss recent progress in understanding how cytosolic proteins recognize the Golgi, and in particular how particular GTPases and lipid species are generated on a subset of cisternae. In addition, I will briefly discuss recent work on the role of palmitoylation, which is emerging as an important mechanism to control the subcellular distribution of proteins.

Introduction
The Golgi apparatus comprises a stack of distinct compartments or cisternae arranged from cis to trans. The cis side receives transport vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) carrying newly made membrane and secreted proteins. This cargo then moves through the stack to the trans side, or trans-Golgi network (TGN), where it is sorted into carriers moving to different destinations in the cell, including the plasma membrane, lysosomes and, in some cell types, storage compartments for regulated secretion. The transport from cis to trans has been proposed to occur either by forward moving vesicles, or by whole cisternae forming at the cis side and then progressing to the TGN to be replaced by more cisternae forming behind them [1,2]. In both cases there would be vesicles moving in a retrograde fashion to recycle membrane or maintain the location of resident membrane proteins within the stack. A detailed discussion of this debate can be found elsewhere in this issue [3]. However, what is undisputed is that the membrane traffic activities of the various cisternae are very different. Thus, cisternae

Activation of Rab family GTPases on the Golgi
The GTPases of the Rab family play a key role in many, if not all, membrane traffic steps. As is the case with other compartments, there are particular Rabs that are found exclusively on specific parts of the Golgi, where they recruit coiled-coil proteins that may tether vesicles or organize Golgi structure, and also recruit motor proteins that allow Golgi membranes to move on the cytoskeleton.

396 Membranes and organelles

The question of how Rabs are directed to specific organelles has been an enduring enigma [6,7]. These GTPases are attached to the membrane by a C-terminal tail comprising a flexible `hypervariable' region followed by two geranylgeranyl lipid groups. Initial studies on endosomal Rabs suggested that this hypervariable region acts as an organelle-specific targeting signal [8]. However, a recent study of a wide range of Rabs, including two on the Golgi, has shown that this region is neither necessary nor sufficient for organelle-specific localization [9]. Instead, it appears that multiple parts of the rest of the protein contribute to organelle specificity. This may reflect recognition of the Rab by the relevant GTP exchange factor (GEF), as those Rab GEFs so far identified also show organelle-specific distributions. However, the situation is likely to be more complex than this, as Rabs from the Golgi and elsewhere also bind to members of two families of wellconserved small membrane proteins, the YIP1 and PRA1/ YIP3 families [6,7,10]. This binding may facilitate initial delivery of the Rab to the right organelle by GDP displacement inhibitor (GDI), the protein factor that carries GDP-bound (i.e. inactive) Rab across the cytosol. The GEF would then activate the Rab, preventing it from being removed by GDI and hence stabilizing its association with the correct membrane. Interestingly, Yip1 interacts with Golgi Rabs, and yet also appears to recycle between the ER and the Golgi and, unlike the Golgi Rabs, is required for efficient formation of COPII vesicles [11,12]. This has lead to the proposal that Yip1 could play a role in coordinating the formation of ER-derived vesicles with the subsequent recruitment of Rabs to the cis-Golgi compartment that receives these vesicles [11,12].

(a Golgi coiled-coil protein), Gmh1 (a membrane protein of unknown function) and Drs2 (a P-type ATPase) [17­ 19]. However, none of these interactions appears to be essential for Golgi targeting, and so the mechanism of recruitment remains unclear. Interestingly, photobleaching of a GFP­GBF1 fusion protein shows it is in rapid exchange with cytoplasm (t1/2=15­30s), and membrane association is stabilized by appropriate mutations or by BFA, both of which promote interaction with the GDPbound form of Arf1 [20,21]. If the early cisternae are maturing and hence only briefly have a `cis' identity then this rapid exchange may ensure that the recruitment of GBF1 is restricted to cisternae in the early part of the stack. Moreover, the interaction with Arf1­GDP raises the interesting possibility that before activation Arf1­ GDP is recruited to Golgi membranes by some factor other than the GEF. If this were the case then the location of Arf1­GTP would be dictated by other factors in addition to the distribution of the Arf GEFs. Evidence that multiple proteins can control the location of an Arf family GTPase has also come from studies of the `Arf-like' GTPase Arl1. This protein is found on the transGolgi of a wide range of eukaryotes and is required for retrograde traffic to the Golgi from parts of the endosomal system [22]. Arl1­GTP interacts with several effectors, the best characterized being long coiled-coil proteins with a C-terminal GRIP domain, a 45­55 residue motif to which Arl1­GTP binds directly [23]. Studies in yeast have found that Golgi targeting of Arl1 is dependent on a second Arf-like GTPase, Arl3 (ARFRP1 in humans), and a small four-transmembrane protein, Sys1 [24,25]. Unlike other Arf family proteins, Arl3 is not myristoylated at the N terminus, but instead is acetylated, and this modification is required for recruitment of Arl3 to the Golgi by Sys1 (Figure 1). Presumably, Arl3­GTP activates or recruits an as-yet-unidentified GEF for Arl1. This unusual targeting pathway may allow regulation of Arl1 activity via Sys1 or acetylation.

Activation of Arf family GTPases on the Golgi
The Arf family GTPases are central to the organization and function of the Golgi, as clearly illustrated by the fact that inhibiting the Golgi Arf GEFs with Brefeldin A (BFA) causes a rapid collapse of the Golgi into the ER. Arf1 recruits several vesicle coat proteins including COPI, GGAs and AP1/clathrin [13]. Recent work has shown that other effectors are also recruited by direct binding to Arf1, including Rud3p (a coiled-coil protein of the yeast cisGolgi) and ARHGAP10 (a GAP for Rho1) [14,15]. These findings show that the specific activation of Arf1 on Golgi membranes is critical for giving these membranes their unique identity. This raises the question of how the Arf GEFs are localized to Golgi membranes, a question made more complex by there being at least two classes of Arf GEF on the Golgi [16]. The two classes comprise related 200kD peripheral membrane proteins with a central Sec7 domain that has GEF activity in those proteins examined. Thus one class, GBF1 (Gea1/2 in yeast), is found on the cisGolgi and the second class, BIG1/BIG2 (Sec7 in yeast), on later compartments. GBF1, or its yeast homologues, have been reported to bind to several proteins including p115

PtdIns(4)P and Golgi membranes
Although Arf1 is a key landmark protein that allows coat proteins and other effectors to locate Golgi membranes, it has become clear that the recruitment of these effectors must involve more than direct binding to Arf1­GTP. This is because many Arf1 effectors show a more restricted distribution in the stack than Arf1 itself. In addition, some effectors even bind to Arf family GTPases from other membranes in vitro, even though the effectors are not located to these membranes in vivo. It is likely that this reflects Golgi binding in vivo being mediated by combinatorial recognition of Arf1 and additional determinants. In the case of coat proteins this may, in some cases, involve interaction with the cytosolic tails of cargo proteins [26]. A more general determinant of Golgi identity that acts in conjunction with Arf1 is the lipid PtdIns(4)P. This lipid is found at the plasma membrane, where it acts as substrate

Activation of the small GTPase Arl1 on Golgi membranes. Recruitment of yeast Arl1 to the trans-Golgi requires a second GTPase Arl3 (ARFRP1 in mammals). Arl3 is acetylated (denoted by Ac) at its N terminus by the NatC complex, and this modification is essential for it to bind, perhaps directly, to the integral membrane protein Sys1 [24,25]. An as-yet-unidentified GTP exchange factor (GEF) then activates Arl3, and the GTP-bound form of Arl3 is thought to recruit or activate an unknown GEF for Arl1. This GEF converts Arl1 from the GDP-bound form, which is only weakly associated with membranes, to the GTP-bound form, which binds tightly to membranes via its amphipathic helix. The GTP-bound form of Arl1 is then recognized by GRIP-domain coiled-coil proteins (Imh1 in yeast) and other peripheral membrane proteins that need to bind to the trans-Golgi.

for synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2; however, it is also synthesized on the Golgi, where it is probably not converted to PtdIns(4,5)P2 but rather is directly recognized by several proteins. These include OSBP, FAPP1 and CERT, a set of lipid-binding proteins with closely related pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that bind to both PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2, but which also require Arf1 for Golgi recruitment [5,27­29]. Similarly, the AP1/clathrin coat requires these two determinants for trans-Golgi binding [30]. Thus the presence of Arf1­GTP and PtdIns(4)P in combination may be a defining feature of the TGN. Again, this raises the question of how the Golgi pool of PtdIns(4)P is synthesized and, as with the activation of Arfs, the situation appears more complex than one might expect or hope. Mammalian cells and yeast have two classes of PtdIns 4-kinase, type II and type III (type I transpired to have a different activity) [31]. Yeast have

one type-II kinase, Lsb6, and two type-III kinases, Pik1 and Stt4. Of these three, Pik1 appears to be solely responsible for Golgi PtdIns(4)P synthesis [32,33]. In mammalian cells there are two kinases of each type, of which two appear to be on the Golgi: a type-III kinase, the Pik1 homologue PI4KIIIb, and a type-II kinase, PI4KIIa [34,35]. Both kinases are peripheral membrane proteins, but how they are themselves recruited to Golgi membranes is as yet unresolved. A recent study has suggested that PI4KIIIb might interact with Rab11, although this GTPase is usually regarded as endosomal, and the yeast Rab11 homologue Ypt31 does not appear to recruit Pik1 [36,37]. In addition to the role of the PtdIns 4-kinases, recent work has shown that the intracellular distribution of PtdIns(4)P is also specified by the localized degradation of the lipid. In yeast, the major PtdIns(4)P-phosphatase is

Sac1, a resident membrane protein of the ER that is also conserved in humans [38]. Removal of Sac1 results in a 10-fold increase in total PtdIns(4)P levels and causes pleiotropic defects in membrane traffic and the actin cytoskeleton [39,40]. This excess PtdIns(4)P appears to accumulate at multiple locations, including the plasma membrane and the vacuole as well as the ER [33,39]. Sac1 appears to restrict the distribution of PtdIns(4)P by recycling between the ER and the early Golgi, and may exert an effect on the plasma membrane and vacuole by contacting these membranes from the ER via junctions where the two membranes are closely apposed [41]. In addition, a recent study has shown that yeast Sac1 moves from the ER to the Golgi when growth is slowed by nutrient limitation, and that this is associated with a concomitant reduction in PtdIns(4)P levels in the Golgi [42]. Thus Sac1 appears to restrict the distribution of PtdIns(4)P to the late Golgi, and (at moderate levels) the plasma membrane by degrading it elsewhere in rapidly growing cells, and may shift its location to reduce Golgi PtdIns(4)P levels when required.

way -- they form a localized labile determinant that is bound non-covalently by cytosolic proteins. However, this is not the only way that peripheral membrane proteins can be targeted to a specific organelle. It has long been known that many peripheral and integral membrane proteins have palmitoyl (C16:0) fatty acyl groups attached to specific cysteine residues. A single palmitoyl group does not confer stable membrane binding, but in combination with another acyl group or a prenyl group will attach a protein firmly to a bilayer. Thus the site of action of the palmitoyltransferase will dictate which of the cell's organelles a particular protein will first associate with. Of course, once associated the protein could be trafficked to other parts of the cell if the lipid modification is not reversible, but if palmitoylation is reversible then a protein could accumulate at the site of lipid addition, or cycle between the organelle where it is added and a downstream organelle where it is removed. Until recently, understanding the dynamics and biology of palmitoylation has been hampered by the difficulty of isolating the protein acyltransferases (PATs) responsible for palmitoyl addition [49]. This changed in 2002 with the identification of two PATs in yeast [50,51]. Both PATs are polytopic membrane proteins that share a `DHHC' motif. This motif is found in many other membrane proteins in both yeast and mammals, and hence defines a family of putative PATs, which presumably have different locations and substrates [50­52]. A detailed discussion of this rapidly emerging field is beyond the scope of this review, but it is worth emphasizing in this context that recent work has shown that at least some of these PATs are localized to the Golgi, and it may be that the Golgi is one of the major cellular sites of protein palmitoylation. In particular, it has recently been found that a Golgi pool of H-Ras and K-Ras is maintained by a cycle of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation (Figure 2). The Ras proteins are palmitoylated on the Golgi, moved by vesicular transport to the plasma membrane and then depalmitoylated and transferred back to the Golgi through the cytosol for repalmitoylation [53]. These observations raise the possibility that the Golgi is able to recruit other proteins by such `acylation trapping', and there is recent evidence that the SNARE protein Ykt6 is recruited to the Golgi and vacuole by reversible palmitoylation [54,55]. This SNARE lacks a transmembrane domain, but instead its C-terminal tail is modified with both prenyl and palmitoyl groups, with the latter addition being required for Golgi localization and Ykt6 function. Indeed, it has long been known that several peripheral membrane proteins, including eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase), SCG10 (a microtubule destabilizing protein) and GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase), are recruited to the Golgi via short palmitoylated sequences, and recognition of these proteins by Golgi-specific PATs could explain these observations [49].

Diacylglycerol and Golgi function
It has long been known that high levels of diacylglycerol (DAG) are generated in the Golgi when lipid head groups are removed for transfer to ceramide during sphingolipid synthesis. The precise fate of this DAG is unclear, although the recent cloning of the Golgi sphingomyelin synthase should open the way to an understanding of the biology of this process [43]. Nonetheless it appears that DAG is required for exit from the TGN, and some proteins appear to use DAG as a means to recognize the Golgi. In particular, a proportion of the cellular pools of three related protein kinases, PKD1 (PKCm), PKD2 and PKD3 (PKCn), are directed to Golgi membranes via DAG-specific cysteine-rich domains, and these kinases have been reported to be required for the efficient formation of basolaterally directed carriers leaving the TGN in polarized cells [44­46]. As DAG is also generated at the plasma membrane during signal transduction events, DAG-binding proteins must presumably recognize other compartment-specific markers to ensure correct targeting. A recent study has highlighted the importance of Golgi DAG levels by showing that Nir2/PITPNM1, a member of the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein family, is also required for generation of Golgi DAG, and is required for the exit of proteins from the TGN in mammalian tissue culture cells [47]. Mice lacking the PITPNM1 die during early development, but null alleles of RdgB, the only Drosophila homologue, develop normally and only show perturbation of retinal and olfactory signalling, suggesting that the PITPNM family may only be required for secretion in some cases [48].

Control of protein localization by reversible palmitoylation. Protein acyltransferases (PATs) attach palmitoyl groups to cysteines on specific cytosolic proteins. If the protein already has an intrinsic affinity for lipid bilayers, for instance if it has an attached prenyl group, then the palmitoylation will cause the protein to accumulate on the membrane that contains the PAT. The effect of this `acylation trapping' on the localization of the protein will depend on if, and where, the palmitoyl group is removed. As shown in (a), a palmitoyl group attached in the Golgi could be removed in the same organelle, and hence the protein would have a transient association with only Golgi membranes. This is proposed to be the case for the SNARE Ykt6, with it being suggested that depalmitoylation may occur following SNARE complex assembly and membrane fusion [54,55]. Alternatively, the palmitoyl group may not be removed in the Golgi, but rather the anchored protein could leave from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) for the plasma membrane (b). Action of an acyl-protein thioesterase (de-PAT) at the plasma membrane would allow the protein to return to the Golgi to repeat the cycle. Such a cycle has been demonstrated for H-Ras and N-Ras, which have two and one palmitoyl attachments, respectively [53]. The nature of the thioesterase that acts on Ras is not clear, although cytosolic proteins with acyl-protein thioesterase activity have been identified [50]. In addition, several proteins are palmitoylated in the Golgi but then accumulate at the plasma membrane, perhaps because they are not depalmitoylated [49]. These systems may allow the cell to restrict the localization of particular proteins to a subset of organelles and the vesicles that connect them.

An interesting hint that palmitoylation in the Golgi might have additional roles apart from directly anchoring proteins to the membrane comes from the crystal structure of Bet3, a subunit of TRAPP. This soluble complex acts on the cisGolgi as a GEF for one or more Golgi Rab proteins. How TRAPP is recruited to Golgi membranes is unknown, but the X-ray structure of Bet3 reveals a long hydrophobic pocket, and in the crystal of bacterially expressed Bet3 this pocket was found to contain either a palmitoyl or a myristoyl acyl chain [56,57]. This acyl group does not appear to need to be attached covalently to Bet3 in yeast, but mutations that block the pocket interfere with Bet3 function, suggesting that recognition of a palmitoyl group on another molecule may help Bet3, and thus TRAPP, bind to the Golgi, and hence initiate production of the Rab proteins that help define the cis-Golgi.

Conclusions
Small GTPases and specific lipids play a central role in defining the identity of all the membranes of the secretory and endocytic pathways. The complex structure and roles of the Golgi apparatus probably account for the

particularly large number of such molecules found on this organelle. If, as is now widely believed, the cisternae of the Golgi form at the cis side and then mature to the trans side, there may well be a hierarchy of recruitment whereby the earliest determinants recruit the factors responsible for generating later determinants. In addition, the multiplicity of these determinants may be important for the independent regulation of different transport steps that impinge on a single cisterna. At present there is still much to be learnt about the molecular mechanisms by which GTPases and lipids are generated on particular parts of the Golgi. So far it seems that many of the key regulatory molecules, including GEFs and lipid kinases, are themselves peripheral membrane proteins, which may ensure that the identity of the cisternae can be rapidly created following ER exit, and then altered if the cisternae are maturing. However, recent studies have highlighted several integral membrane proteins that also play important roles, such as the YIP families (whose members bind to Rabs), Sys1 (which binds Arl3/ARFPR1) and the PATs. These membrane proteins may allow recruitment of trafficking proteins from the cytosol to be coordinated

with events inside the cisternae as the latter mature. In addition, they may be of particular importance to vesicles involved in transport, which must somehow be distinguished from the compartment from which they have budded to ensure that the target organelle fuses with the vesicle and not its source. It is clear that as more is learnt about how Golgi-specific GTPases and lipids are generated, more will be revealed about the underlying organization and logic of the Golgi.

Defining the identity of Golgi membranes Munro 401

The targeting of Golgi-localized PH domains, such as those of FAPP and OSBP, depends on PtdIns(4)P and as a result they are sometimes used as intracellular reporters of PtdIns(4)P, despite their also binding PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro. This paper clearly shows that these PH domains do not recognise all PtdIns(4)P in yeast, presumably reflecting the known additional requirement for Arf1 for Golgi binding. In addition, the membrane binding of the PH domain from the yeast protein Osh2 appears to be solely dependent on PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2, allowing a clearer examination of the subcellular distribution of these lipids. 34.

J Cell Biol 2005, 168:185-191. This paper shows that the PtdIns(4)P-phosphatase Sac1 is retained in the ER by binding another ER protein, but that when nutrients are limiting Sac1 redistributes to the Golgi and hence reduces Golgi PtdIns(4)P levels. 43.

Science 2005, 307:1746-1752. This paper reveals that H-Ras and N-Ras undergo a cycle of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation that maintains their distribution on both the Golgi and the plasma membrane. Depalmitoylation appears to allow activated Ras to translocate across the cytosol to the Golgi, where it can recruit effectors. 54.
