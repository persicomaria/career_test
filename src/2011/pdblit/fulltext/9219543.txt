The three-dimensional solution structure of the lantibiotic actagardine was determined at high resolution by homonuclear and heteronuclear two-dimensional and three-dimensional NMR spectroscopy in [2H3]acetonitrile/H,0 (7 : 3). 133 non-trivial distance and 22 torsional-angle constraints were derived from the NMR data. An ensemble of 15 low-energy structures was calculated by distance geometry followed by an iterative relaxation-matrix-refinement procedure. The rmsd of the backbone coordinates with respect to the average structure was 17 pm. The two distinct thioether ring systems 1-6 and 7-19 were even better defined, with backbone rmsd of 10 pm and 14 pm, respectively. Actagardine shows a rigid compact globular shape based on the constraining bridging pattern, which is composed of an N-terminal lanthionine ring from residues 1-6 and three intertwined C-terminal methyllanthionine rings comprising residues 7-12, 9-17 and 14-19. In addition, this C-terminal ring system is stabilised by a short antiparallel / l sheet. A feature of the actagardine structure is the presence of two putative binding pockets. A pocket is generated by the covalent constraints of the C-terminal thioether ring system. The rim of this pocket is built up by a loop structure comprising residues 12- 19, whose backbone amide protons are all directed to the centre of the pocket. The second pocket is formed by an L-shaped orientation of the N-terminal and C-terminal thioether ring systems. The only two hydrophilic amino acid residues of actagardine, Glull and Ser2, are directed to this pocket. A region of high sequence similarity with the related lantibiotic mersacidin is located exactly at the position of the second pocket (residues 3-12). This suggests that the second pocket is responsible for the antibiotic mode of action of actagardine and mersacidin as inhibitors of the murein biosynthesis of gram-positive bacteria.

Lantibiotics are polycyclic peptide antibiotics with characteristic sulfide bridges, which are formed by the unusual thioether amino acids (2S, 6R)-meso-lanthionine and (2S, 3S, 6R)-3methyllanthionine. The biosynthesis of lantibiotics comprises the ribosomal synthesis of a prepeptide followed by posttranslational modification and cleavage of a leader sequence (Jung, 1991, 1992; Sahl et al., 1995). The lantibiotic actagardine (formerly known as gardimycin) consists of 19 amino acid residues with one lanthionine bridge and three methyllanthionine bridges. A primary structure of actagardine was first published by Kettenring et al. (1990). Based on two-dimensional and three-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, electrospray mass spectrometry, and Edman degradation after

chemical modification, the primary structure was subsequently revised by Zimmermann et al. (1995) (Fig. 1). In constrast to the well known antibiotic penicillin, which acts by inhibition of the murein glycopeptide transpeptidase, the mode of action of actagardin probably consists of inhibition of the glycopeptide transglycosylase. The pathway of transglycosylase inhibition by actagardine differs from that of the antibiotic vancomycin, which is active by binding to the C-terminal muramyl-tripeptide L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala. Brotz et al. (1995) showed that the activities of mersacidin and actagardine were not influenced by this tripeptide. For vancomycin, however, the tripeptide was able to compete successfully with the native muramyl peptide substrate. Therefore, actagardine must have a distinct unknown mode of action of transglycosylase inhibition. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of actagardine could help to unravel the mode of inhibition and interaction with the murein monomer units.

600 spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz ('H). The acquisition and processing parameters including 'H and 13C assignments were described previously (Zimmermann et al., 1995). The present structure of actagardine is based on the following series of spectra: clean-TOCSY (Griesinger et al., 1988), NOESY (Jeener et al., 1979; Macura und Emst, 1980), rotating-frame NOESY (Bothner-By et al., 1984; Bax and Davis, 1985), three-dimensional NOESY/TOCSY (Griesinger et al., 1989), primitive exclusive correlation spectroscopy (PE-COSY) (Mueller, 1987 ; Bax and Lerner, 1988) gradient-enhanced sensitivity-enhanced 'H,I3C and 'H, 15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (Kay et al., 1992; Schleucher et al., 1994), ' H , ' T heteronuclearmultiple-quantum-coherence-TOCSY (Lerner and Bax, 1986) and gradient-enhanced 'H,I3C heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (Bax and Summers, 1986; Bax and Pochapsky, 1992). The NMR data set for conformational analysis comprised NOESY spectra at 296 K recorded with mixing times of 50, 150 and 450 ms, and PE-COSY spectra recorded at 305 K. To maximize the accuracy of the NOE measurements, the acquisition and processing parameters, with the exception of the mixing time, were identical for all three NOESY spectra. The NOESY spectra were recorded consecutively to minimize errors resulting from different shimming, temperature and sample conditions. Water suppression was achieved by continuous irradiation during the relaxation delay (1.5 s) and during the mixing time of the NOESY spectra. The carrier frequency was placed on the water resonance utilizing a sweep width of 7200 Hz in w, and 0,. Quadrature detection in the indirect detected dimensions was employed by time-proportional phase incrementation (Marion and Wuthrich, 1983). Time-domain matrices of the NOESY and PE-COSY spectra were processed with the Bruker UXNMR software as described by Zimmermann et al. (1995). The final resolution of the spectra was 2.2 Hz/point (1.1 Hz/point for the PE-COSY) in w2and 7.0 Hz/point in wl. All frequency-domain matrices were transferred from Bruker format to the FELIX 2.3 NMR software (Biosym Inc.) for further analysis. Interproton distance constraints and NOE volumes. Cross-peaks from NOESY spectra with mixing times of 50, 150 and 450ms were integrated with the FELIX 2.3 software. Interproton distances were calculated on the basis of the isolated

spin-pair approximation (ISPA) model with r-6 dependence of the NOE build-up rates (Neuhaus and Williamson, 1989). The well-resolved P-methylene cross-peaks of Alal2 and Ala19 were used as reference distances (178 pm) for calibration. Upper and lower bounds were generated by adding 20% or subtracting 15% to the interproton distances. Partially overlapping NOE cross-peaks and peaks close to the water resonance were treated qualitatively with distance bounds from 180 ppm to 500 pm, and were not stored in the volume lists for relaxation-matrix refinement. Torsional-angle constraints and stereospecific assignment. When possible 3JHN.Ho coupling constants were directly extracted from the resolution-enhanced Lorentz to Gauss transformed one-dimensional proton spectra. Otherwise, antiphase splittings of HN-Ha cross peaks of the PE-COSY spectra were used for determination of 3JHN.Ha. 3JH,.Hp The coupling constants were determined by investigation of passive in-phase Ha-HP splittings in the PE-COSY multiplets of HP-Hj? cross-peaks. Accordingly, the passive Ha-HP couplings could be measured in HN-Ha cross peaks as passive in-phase splittings, if the antiphase splittings of the active HN-Ha coupling were large enough to be resolved. Constraints for the backbone torsional angle 4 were derived from the 3JHN.Ho coupling constants according to the Karplus curve calibrated by Pardi et al. (1984). 3JHN values Ha less than 5.5 Hz constrains 4 in the a-helical range from -90" to -40", 33H,.,, values greater than 8.0 Kz are related to 4 angles in the P-sheet region from -160" to -80". For the D-configurated Ala and 2-aminobutanoic acid (Abu) residues, we used the same 4 ranges as for the L residues but with positive sign. The range of the xl torsional angle was calculated according to the Karplus curve calibrated by Demarco et al. (1978). The stereospecific assignment of diastereotopic P-methylene protons was achieved by inspection of 3JH,.Hp coupling constants and HN-HP NOE effects as described by Basus (1989). Diastereotopic groups, for which stereospecific assignmens were not available, were introduced as pseudo atoms according to (Wuthrich, 1986). Structure calculations. The structure calculations of actagardine were based on the following protocol. A low-definition structure ensemble was generated by distance geometry based

Zirnrnerrnann and Jung (Eul: J. Biochern. 246) on distance constraints from build-up rates of NOESY crosspeak volumes at mixing times of 50, 150 and 450 ms, including dihedral restraints from 'J-coupling constants and chiral constraints for stereocenters with established chirality. The actagardine structure ensemble consisted of 15 individual conformations with lowest distance-geometry error functions of 100 distance-geometry starting structures. The distance-geometry ensemble was refined by an iterative relaxation-matrix approach utilizing the ensemble averaging method. The iterative relaxation-matrix approach (IRMA) ensemble was additionally minimized by a molecular-dynamics and energy-minimisation protocol. The complete structure-calculation protocol was carried out with the NMRchitect module of the Insight11 molecular-modelling software package, version 2.3.0 (Biosym, 1993) installed on Silicon Graphics IRIS Indigo R4000 Elan and R3000 XS workstations. For distance-geometry calculations, the software module DGII was used (Havel, 1991). The relaxation-matrix analysis was carried out with the IRMA subsystem (Boelens et al., 1988, 1989). Molecular dynamics and energy minimisation were carried out with the molecular-mechanics system DISCOVER 2.9 using the Biosym consistent-valence force field (Dauber-Osguthorpe et al., 1988). The thioether bridges were introduced as three different amino acid residues, corresponding to D-Abu, D-Ala without sulfur and L-Ala with sulfur. Distance geometry with the DGII package. Distance ranges based on the NOE build-up rates, and converted distance bounds from dihedral constraints were smoothed by applying triangle inequalities. Subsequently, the distance bounds were transformed to the metric matrix as input for the embedding procedure to obtain Cartesian coordinates from distance space. Geometries from embedding are usually very poor and require additional optimisation. The optimisation procedure used for actagardine within DGII comprised a simulated-annealing protocol utilizing an error function that includes penalty energies for distance violations, Van der Waals' interactions and chiral volumes of stereocenters. For details concerning the different steps of the DGII algorithm, refer to Havel et al. (1991). IRMA with ensemble averaging. The IRMA procedure provides an accurate determination of distance bounds by calculation of the complete relaxation matrix based on mixed model and experimental NOE intensities (Boelens et al., 1988, 1989). In the relaxation-matrix approach, multistep cross-relaxation is explicitly considered, whereas the simple ISPA frequently used in the literature leads to errornous distance bounds caused by spin-diffusion effects. The IRMA procedure can be summarized as follows. From an arbitrary starting structure and a known or estimated molecular-correlation time, the relaxation matrix R is calculated. Diagonalisation of R leads to an NOE-intensity matrix A, which is mixed with the experimental NOE intensities of the different mixing times. This mixed intensity matrix A (experimental + model) is itself diagonalised, yielding relaxation matrices R for the different mixing times, which are subsequently averaged into an mean relaxation matrix (R). From this relaxation matrix, improved distance bounds can be derived, which are themselves used as input for structure generation, usually by distance geometry or small simulated-annealing protocols. For actagardine, DGII was used to calculate the improved structures. From these improved coordinates, the procedure described above is perfomed in an iterative fashion until the difference between experimental and model NOE intensities is minimal and constant. These differences provide a direct estimation of the structure quality obtained by the IRMA procedure and are referred as NMR R factors, according to the related R factors in

with experimental and calculated NOE intensities A , between protons i and J averaged over the different mixing times t. , The quality of the IRMA structures can be further improved by a procedure developed by Bonvin et al. (1993) using ensemble-averaged coordinates as input for the relaxation-matrix calculations. This ensemble approach provides a more accurate interpretation of NOE data in terms of local mobility, which is reflected by the mean positions of the corresponding protons in the averaged structures. For actagardine, distance-geometry ensembles comprising the 15 structures with lowest DGII error functions were used for coordinate averaging within the IRMA cycle. As starting structures, the distance-geometry ensemble from NOE build-up rates were used. To compensate for fast internal motions, methyl groups and aromatic rings were treated with an r-3 motional model. The molecular correlation time of actagardine was estimated to be 0.8 ns, based on the known correlation time and molecular mass of the protein crambin (7, = 2 ns, M , = 4715) and assuming a linear dependence between correlation time and molecular mass, which is itself based on the Stokes-Einstein equation of molecular motion of spherical molecules. Refinement by molecular dynamics and energy minimisation. Molecular coordinates obtained from an IRMNdistance-geometry procedure require further minimisation by molecular-mechanics calculations with a well-established force field, because the error function of distance-geometry programs is made intentionally simple due to performance reasons. For actagardine, a small molecular-dynamics and energy-minimisation protocol at moderate temperature was applied on the final IRMADGII ensemble utilizing DISCOVER 2.9 and the consistent-valence forcefield. The molecular-dynamics and energy-minimisation procedure is given in Table 3.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Distribution of NOE effects. For actagardine, 133 non-trivial NOE distance constraints of 184 NOESY cross-peaks were used for structure calculations. The experimental distance constraints comprised 56 intraresidual, 48 sequential and 29 long-range NOE effects. Fig. 2 shows the NOE connectivity map of actagardine, indicating the two distinct thioether ring systems 1- 6 and 7-19 with many NOE contacts between the rings but no longrange NOE effects between the two particular ring systems. The sequence-specific distribution and frequency of NOE effects is depicted in Fig. 2. In the NOE distribution map (Fig. 2) the two glycines at positions 3 and 13 could be readily recognized by the small amount of NOE effects based on lacking side chain contacts. Coupling constants and stereospecific assignments. Dihedral constraints for the backbone torsional angle 4 could be derived for 13 of 19 residues (Table 1). Ile16 and Alal8 showed small 3JHN.H,, coupling constants, constraining the corresponding 4 angles to the a-helical region. Residues Trp4, Va15, Abu9, IlelO, Ala12, Abul4, Va115, Ala17 and Ala19 showed 'JH,.,,-coupling constants beyond 8.5 Hz. Therefore, these residues were constrainted to the P-sheet range from -80" to - 160". The methylene groups of Trp4, Ala6, Glull, Ala12 and Ala19 could be stereospecifically assigned (Table 1).

Structure ensembles of actagardine at different stages of optimisation. First stage: distance geometry with DGII. The first optimisation stage comprised DGII calculations based on NOE build-up-rate-derived distance constraints, dihedral angles and chiral volumes from known amino acid configurations. In addition to the NOESY spectra with 50-ms and 150-ms mixing times, the NOESY spectrum with 450-ms mixing time was used for the build-up-rate calculation due to the superior signal-tonoise level. The success rate of 100 initial structures that passed the limit of 1.0 of the DGII error function was between 17% in the first DGII step and 90% in the final DGIIDRMA cycle. Although spin-diffusion effects have to be considered at 450-ms mixing time, the resulting raw DGII ensemble was well defined for a first-stage calculation, showing only few distance violations. The good quality of the 15 best DGII structures with

lowest error functions demonstrated by the small backbone rmsd of 81 pm (Table 4). The calculated structure ensemble is shown in Fig. 3. Determination of the configuration of meso-lanthionine Alal -S-Ala6. The unusual thioether amino acids of lantibiotics are biosynthesised by stereospecific addition of the thiol group of L-CYSon dehydrated serine or threonine residues resulting in a inversion of the Ca atoms of the Ser and Thr precursors (Schnell et a1., 1988). Therefore, all lantibiotics discovered show 2S, 3S, 6R configuration for p-methyllanthionine and a 2S, 6R configuration for the lanthionine residues. If the sequential position of the (2S, 3S)-Abu moieties of the p-methyllanthionines are known, as for actagardine (Zimmermann et a]., 1995), the configuration of the corresponding Ala moieties can be directly derived to be R from the NMR assignment of the thioether bridges. Lanthionine Alal -S-Ala6, however, can be arranged in two possible sequential configurations, namely (2S, 6R)-Alal-S-Ala6 or (2R, 6S)-Alal-S-Ala6. To resolve this ambiguity, we inspected the NOES and coupling constants related to the Alal-S-

Ala6 ring for both configurations. Consequently, the DGII procedure described before was accomplished for both possible meso-lanthionine configurations by means of pseudoatoms for Ala(l,G)-HP, Hf. We found a 37% decrease of the DGII error function for the (2S, 6R)-Alal-S-Ala6 configuration. Correspondingly, the constraint violations and the rmsd values were significantly lowered for the ( 2 S , 6R)-Alal-S-Ala6 configuration. Considering only the backbone atoms of the first Alal-SAla6 lanthionine ring, the distance violations greater than 20 pm were decreased by 64 %. The two DGII calculations of actagardine based on the same input distance and dihedral angle input data strongly support a (2S, 6R)-Alal-S-Ala6 configuration of the first meso-lanthionine ring. This result corresponds to the well-known preference of thioether-bridge formation from the C-terminus to the N-terminus, which was always found in A-type lantibiotics (Sahl et al., 1995). Therefore, further optimisation of the DGII ensemble was performed with the (2S, 6R)-Alal-S-Ala6 configuration. The mirror (2R, 6s)-configuration of the first meso-lanthionine bridge of actagardine, however, can still not be excluded completely. The amount of distance violations and the value of the distance geometry error function are just at the limit where inherent errors from the utilised ISPA model can compensate the differences between the two configurations. Hence, without

knowledge of the strucutural gene of actagardine, the question of the configuration of Alal and Ala6 cannot be answered. Second stage: IRMA with ensemble averaging. The IRMA calculations were based on cross-peak volumes of the NOESY spectra with mixing times of 50, 150 and 450 ms, and the starting ensemble resulting from the first-stage DGII calculations. The ensemble average of the 15 best DGII structures 100 starting structures were used to calculate the relaxation matrix. The IRMA cycle produced improved distance boundaries, which were subsequently put in another DGII analysis. This IRMA/ DGII cycle was repeated until convergence of the R values. After four iterations, the R values were constant. Third stage: molecular dynamics and energy minimisation o the final IRMMDGII ensemble. To relax remaining local tenf sions and steric conflicts, the IRMA/DGII structure ensemble was further optimised by means of a small molecular-dynamics and energy-minimisation protocol (Table 3). After minimisation and temperature equilibration, a 5-ps restrained molecular-dynamics simulation of the whole ensemble was performed at 300 K, followed by a final energy minimisation. The overlay plot of the 15 minimum conformations after the molecular-dynamics procedure is shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding energy values during the different steps of the protocol are depicted in Table 3.

R factors and constraint violations of actagardine ensembles at different stages of optimisation. The distance-constraint violations at subsequent IRMA-optimisation levels, R factors, and corresponding rmsd values are summarised in Table 4. The backbone rmsd for the 15 best structures of an actagardine ensemble decreased from 81 pm for the DGII starting structure to 30 pm after the relaxation-matrix analysis. The rmsd values of the two distinct N-terminal and C-terminal thioether ring systems decreased to 13 pm for the Alal-S-Ala6 ring A and to 24 pm for the methyllanthionine ring system 7- 19 (ring B). After simulating annealing, the rmsd of the total structure dropped to 10 pm (ring A), 14 pm (ring B), and 17 pm for both ring systems. The precision of the actagardine structure compares to a third-generation protein structure according to the nomenclature of Clore et al. (1994), which is usually reached with more than 10 constraintslamino acid residue. A more detailed look at the optimisation levels (Table 4) showed that the value of the DGII error function increased from the DGII start run to the first IRMA optimisation stage. The

reason for this increase of the error function was the narrower distance limits produced by the IRMA optimisation. These more narrow distance limits led at the first IRMA/DGII run to a increased DGII error function. Nevertheless, the DGII error function decreased beyond 0.1 after the fourth IRMA cycle, which indicates the good convergence of the IRMA procedure. Correspondingly, the amount of distance violations increased from the DGII starting analysis to the fourth IRMA/DGII cycle from 4.7 to 9.1. This result is based on the narrower distance ranges produced by the first and subseqent IRMA cycles. After optimisation with molecular dynamics and energy minimisation, 6.5 distance violations over 15 pm were observed for the final structure ensemble. If the more relaxed distance ranges of the first build-up-rate DGII analysis were used for calculation of distance violations, the final optimised structure ensemble revealed on average only one violation greater than 15 pm (Table 4). The R values of the IRMA calculations of actagardine were, with values around 0.5, somewhat higher than one might expect

from the low rmsd values of the actagardine structure ensembles. To resolve this discrepancy, we compared our results with an ensemble IRMA refinement of the protein crambin (Bonvin et al., 1993). The crambin IRMA calculations showed a backbone rmsd of 0.7 pm with a final R value of 0.36. The increased Rvalues of actagardine compared with those of crambin were, in our opinion, mainly based on the small or in some cases lacking NOE intensities of the short NOESY mixing times, corresponding to a medium-sized molecule near wz,= 1.12. Therefore, the NOE-intensity matrices of the short mixing times could not be filled exactly with experimental intensities. Instead, the theoretical NOE intensities of the structural model were filled in the intensity matrices when experimental intensities were missing. This resulted in differences between model and experimental intensity values, and correspondingly increased R values. Another source of error of the higher R value of actagardine compared with that of crambin might have been the selection of an incorrect correlation time. We have investigated this possibility during our IRMA procedure and have tested several correlation times to obtain the lowest possible R value. Our results showed, that R values changed only slightly ( -C 15 %) on variation of the correlation time from 0.4 ns to 1.2 ns. The selected crambin-based correlation time of 0.8 ns gave the lowest possible R value. Summarising our observations, it is, in our opinion, very important for medium-sized molecules around wz, = 1.12 to incorporate mixing times greater than 400 ms in the refinement process, because only at this rather long mixing times do small

NOE effects, which correspond to long distances, become visible. The spin-diffusion effects occuring for short distances at long mixing times were compensated by IRMA, hence, leading to a better quantification of long-mixing-time-NOESY spectra.

Description and discussion of the three-dimensional structure of the lantibiotic actagardine. Overall structure. Actagardine can be described as a compact, globular species with a spacial dimension of 2.3X2.1X1.2 nm. Because of the thioetherbridging pattern, actagardine is divided in two distinct ring segments, named A and B (Figs 6 and 7). Ring A is formed by the lanthionine bridge Alal -S-Ala6. The second ring segment B is built from three intertwisted P-methyllanthionine bridges, Abu7S-Alal2, Abu9-S-Ala17 and Abul4-S-Alal9. From the two ring systems, 1-6 and 7-19, the N-terminal ring A shows the best definition, with a rmsd value of 10 pm. The C-terminal D-methyllanthionine ring system B exhibits a very rigid conformation, demonstrated by the low rmsd of 14 pm. Numerous NOE contacts between ring systems A and B lead to fixed torsional angles of the interconnection segment Ala6-Abu7 between rings A and B. Based on these constraints, ring segments A and B were arranged together in a plane and exhibit an L-shaped orientation with respect to each other. Actagardine shows a rigid and defined tertiary structure. This result is further demonstrated by the low rmsd value of the total structure ensemble of 17 pm. Conformation o the ring segment Alal -S-Ala6. The conforf mation of lanthionine ring A of actagardine is defined with high accuracy by numerous inter-ring NOE effects and coupling con-

stants. Ring A is build up from 19 atoms and has a diameter of 1 nm. The Alal-S-Ala6 ring is not planar, but revelals a tub-like arrangement. The base of the tub lies near residues Val5 and Ser2, whereas the sides of the tub are formed by the thioether side chain of Alal and Gly3 (Fig. 7). Actagardine has three short P-sheet segments. The three-dimensional structure of actagardine shows some structural elements that were not found before in lantibiotic structures. In ring segment 7- 19 (ring B), hydrogen-bond distances were found for Alal8-HN to Abu9-CO and Glull-HN to Alal8-CO. This hydrogen-bond pattern corresponds to a short P-sheet segment of segments 10-12 and 18-19. Due to the structural constraint of the thioether link of P-methyllanthionine Abu7-S-Alal2, a /l-

turn structure is formed between residues Abu7 and Glull, where IlelO-HN and Abu7-CO are arranged close to H-bond distance. Because of the ring tension induced by the covalent thioether link, an ideal P-turn conformation could not be formed. The antiparallel P-sheet segments, residues 7-8 and 10- 11, are followed by the parallel p-sheet segment, residues 9-12 and 17-19. Residues 7-8, 9-12 and 17-19 form a small, three8 stranded , sheet with two parallel strands and one antiparallel strand (Figs 5 and 6). This partial structure is linked with the big loop segment between the thioether bridge starting points Ah12 and Ala17. The /l-methyllanthionine bridges Abu7-SAla12 and Abu9-S-Alal7 elongate this loop and form an oval, planar cycle built from 29 atoms with a spatial dimension of

to incorporate a H-bond acceptor. This binding pocket cannot be formed by mersacidin and is therefore a molecular property found only in the actagardine structure. G u l l and Ser2 form a hydrophitic binding pocket. The sequence of actagardine is built from mostly hydrophobic amino acid residues. The only hydrophilic residues, Glull and Ser2, form the outer rim of a binding pocket, which is spanned by the L-shaped arrangement of ring systems A and B with the segment Ser2-Alal-S-Ala6-Abu7-S-Alal2-Glull 5 and 9). This (Figs pocket is located exactly within the region that shows sequence similarity with the mode-of-action-related lantibiotic mersacidin. The sequence of actagardine from Gly3 to Alal2 is very similar to the sequence of mersacidin residues Gly9 to Ah18 (Fig. 1). Actagardine and mersacidin possess in this region the same thioether-bridging pattern. Furthermore, the relative position of Glul 1 is the same in both lantibiotics. This coincidence between the two structures leads to the conclusion that this binding pocket, with the conserved Glull residue, has a central function in the mode of action of the inhibition of the murein transglycosylase.

Summary. The three-dimensional structure of actagardine was determined with very high precison and accuracy. The structure calculation was performed by distance geometry followed by IRMA refinement. Actagardine is comprised of two distinct thioether ring systems, which are linked by a short linear segment. A feature of the actagardine structure is the formation of two putative binding pockets. The first pocket results from the characteristic cyclisation pattern of the C-terminal ring system. The rim of this pocket is built from a loop structure, whose amide functions are directed to the center of the pocket. The Cterminal ring segment is additionally stabilised by a short threestranded p sheet. Due to Van der Waals' interactions, the N-terminal lanthionine ring has an almost perpendicular position with respect to the C-terminal methyllanthionine ring system. A second binding pocket is formed by this L-shaped orientation of the two thioether ring systems in such a manner that the only two hydrophilic residues, Glull and Ser2, are directed to the centre of the second pocket. Since the mode of action of actagardine with respect to inhibition of the murein biosynthesis has not been covered by any therapeutic agent, the structural elements and arrangement of the binding pockets found in the three-dimensional structure of actagardine might serve as a lead structure for the development of antibiotic drugs.
