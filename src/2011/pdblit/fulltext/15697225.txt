ABSTRACT: Assignment of heteronuclear and homonuclear multidimensional NMR spectra permits determination of the first three-dimensional solution structure of a higher-plant thioredoxin h. The collection of 1906 distance restraints, 137 TALOS-derived dihedral restraints, and 66 hydrogen bonds was used in the restrained molecular dynamics protocol to calculate the structure of the reduced form of thioredoxin h1 from poplar with an atomic rmsd of 0.60 ( 0.12 Å. This enzyme exhibits an unusual active site with the sequence WCPPC and original properties in terms of stability and specificity. Compared to other known thioredoxin structures, thioredoxin h1 from poplar adopts the classical "Trx fold". Its atypical active site possesses a conformation similar to that of other common thioredoxins but appears to be more rigid. Moreover, the hydrogen bond network, stabilizing the in-core -sheet, is tighter than in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, explaining the difference in thermostability.

Thioredoxins (Trxs)1 belong to a superfamily of oxidoreductases, the function of which is either to create disulfide bonds (protein disulfide isomerases) or to reduce disulfide bonds (glutaredoxins and thioredoxins) (1). Thioredoxins are ubiquitous small proteins (ca. 120 amino acids in the mature form), generally very stable, and excellent catalysts for disulfide reduction. Although thioredoxins can be quite divergent in their primary structure, they seem to be related, at the three-dimensional level, to all proteins characterized so far possessing a similar architecture, named the thioredoxin fold (2). Genome sequencing has revealed that there are numerous thioredoxin genes in plants (at least 20 in Arabidopsis thaliana) (3). The h class of thioredoxins is specific to plant organisms. It represents a large multigenic family involved in various processes as protection against oxidative stress and carbon and nitrogen metabolism regulation, but their exact role and cellular distribution remain unclear at least for some isoforms. In higher plants, several members of a subgroup of thio This research was supported by the CNRS, the Universities of Nancy I, and INPL.

redoxin h, called subgroup I (4), present unique functional and structural features as a variant active site with two Cys residues and the sequence WCPPC. These "CPPC enzymes" have been studied biochemically in vitro with the poplar and Arabidopsis proteins, and found to possess catalytic properties similar to those of the CGPC enzymes (5, 6). The use of yeast mutants suggests, however, that the CPPC enzymes may act specifically in some oxidoreduction reactions, including sulfate assimilation, where they cannot be replaced with the CGPC isoforms (7). No structural study has been reported about thioredoxin h from higher plants, but the closest structure known is that of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (8), the sequence of which is only 53% identical with that of poplar thioredoxin h1. Thus, to understand the consequence of the G to P mutation for the structure, properties, and specificity of thioredoxin, we have overexpressed poplar thioredoxin h1 (PtTrxh1) and purified isotopically labeled samples. We report here the first structure of a higher-plant thioredoxin h, determined by NMR spectroscopy, and the structural comparison with other thioredoxins possessing the more classical CGPC active site. As a first step in this study, we recently reported the nearcomplete (97%) 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shift assignment of reduced thioredoxin h1 from poplar (9). These chemical shifts were deposited in the BioMagResBank as entry BMRB-6079. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Preparation. The coding sequence of thioredoxin h1 from Populus tremula was cloned into the pET-Trxh1 expression vector and used to modify the expression of Escherichia coli strain BL21. The 15N- and 13C-labeled

sample was prepared by growing cells at 37 °C in minimal medium M9, supplemented with 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as the sole nitrogen source and with 13Clabeled glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as the only carbon source. Purification and concentration were carried out as described by Behm and Jacquot (5). The sample purity and molecular mass (12 444 Da for 113 residues) were checked by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry, respectively. The uniformly 15N- and 13C-labeled NMR sample had a protein concentration of 1.85 mM (95% H2O and 5% D2O) in 50 mM phosphate buffer and 10 mM 1,5-dithiothreitold10 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) (pH 5.9) and sealed under argon. NMR Spectroscopy and Experimental Restraints. All spectra were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker DRX 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a gradient three-axis TXI probe.

Spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker) and analyzed with XEASY (10). TSP-d4 (Euriso-top) was used as an internal reference for 1H chemical shifts and as external reference for calibration of 13C chemical shifts. Indirect referencing was used for the 15N chemical shift (11). Backbone amide 1HN, 1HR, 15N, 13CR, and 13C resonances were assigned using 1H-15N HSQC (Figure 1), HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, and 1H-15N HSQC-TOCSY experiments, and side chain 1H and 13C resonances were assigned using 1H-15N HSQCTOCSY and HCCH-TOCSY experiments. Interproton distance restraints were derived from three-dimensional 1H13 15 C/ N HSQC-NOESY experiments with mixing times of 75 and 150 ms; a particular 1H-13C HSQC-NOESY experiment was performed with the 13C frequency carrier set to 150 ppm (corresponding to the aromatic carbons) and mixing times of 70 ms, for assignment of the aromatic protons. NOE

Solution Structure of Reduced Thioredoxin h1 from Poplar cross-peaks were classified as strong, medium, weak, and very weak, and converted into upper limits of 2.5, 3.5, 5.5, and 6.5 Å, respectively. Restraints involving pseudoatoms were systematically overestimated. Backbone  and  dihedral restraints were derived from TALOS (12) using as input the 1H, 13C, and 15N backbone chemical shifts determined previously. Only TALOS prediction with 10 matches agreeing was used as  and  dihedral restraints which are fixed by the average values with a standard deviation range with a minimum of 10°. All peptide bonds were kept planar and trans, with the exception of that between Met80 and Pro81 which was restrained to be planar and cis on the basis of the observation of a strong CRH(i)CRH(i + 1) NOE between Met80 and Pro81 (13), and C and C chemical shifts of Pro81 (C ) 34.86 ppm, C ) 25.56 ppm) (14). 1H-15N HSQC experiments were performed at different temperatures (279.2, 284.7, 289.2, 294.9, 299.6, and 305.4 K) to determine the temperature coefficient (/T) for each observable HN on the 1H-15N HSQC spectra. This method permits us to include a priori experimental hydrogen bond restraints in the calculation on the basis of a weak observed temperature coefficient (15) correlating with the secondary structure prediction (see Table S1 of the Supporting Information for details about temperature coefficients). Hydrogen bond restraints were treated as two distance restraints with an upper limit of 2.4 Å between the hydrogen and the acceptor heavy atom and an upper limit of 3.5 Å between the acceptor and donor heavy atoms. Experimental restraints are summarized in Table 1. Structure Calculations. Initial structures were calculated with DYANA (16). Three hundred randomized structures were generated, and simulated annealing calculations were performed with DYANA. The five structures with the lowest target function were selected for refinement. The structures were refined by a minimization protocol using DISCOVER (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) and the cvff force field (17) with a distance-dependent dielectric constant set to 4r, by means of 100 steps of steepest descent followed by 10 000 steps of a conjugate gradient algorithm. The five minimized structures were used as starting structures for restrained molecular dynamics at 300 K; after an equilibration period of 200 ps, each of the five structures was recorded every 5 ps over the course of 50 ps to generate 50 structures. The 20 best-fitting structures were selected as the final set. An arithmetic average was computed with MOLMOL (18) to describe the mean structure. Tables and figures were created using DYANA, MOLMOL, PROCHECK-NMR (19), and INSIGHT II. The coordinates of the 20 final structures have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank as entry 1TI3. RESULTS NOE Assignments and Structure Determination. After the required backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N assignments had been made (9), the three-dimensional HSQCNOESY spectrum was examined. A first set of approximately 900 unambiguous restraints (including dihedral restraints and hydrogen bonds stabilizing evident secondary structure elements) allows us to define the overall topology of PtTrxh1. Taking this topology into account, we then found it easier

to assign ambiguous correlations and to identify the heavy atom acceptor for HN exhibiting a low temperature coefficient (as HN 137 or HN41), and to gather the final set of 1906 distance restraints used for the calculation procedure described below (NOEs are represented in Figure 2). Structural Statistics. The 20 final structures of reduced PtTrxh1 exhibit an atomic rms distribution about the mean coordinate positions of 0.5 ( 0.1 Å for the backbone atoms and 0.90 ( 0.15 Å for all of the heavy atoms, excluding the two N- and C-terminal residues, which are ill-defined. The restrained molecular dynamics protocol has the advantage of offering a dynamic view of the structure, and most of the restraint violations are less than 0.1 Å. The structure set fits the experimental restraints with no interproton distance and torsion angle violations greater than 0.2 Å and 10°, respectively (Table 1). As shown in Figure 3, the rms distribution is not homogeneous along the sequence, which indicates a degree of flexibility in some regions (loops or turns). All of the backbone torsion angles of the non-glycine residues fall in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, with the exception of Lys90 which is implicated in the -bulge (Table 1). Description of the OVerall Structure. The overall structure of PtTrxh1 adopts a classical Trx fold that consists of a fivestranded -sheet surrounded by four R-helices. Figure 4A shows the superposition of the 20 backbone structures and a schematic view of the regular secondary elements of the most representative structure. Approximately 80% of the

residues in PtTrxh1 are involved in regular secondary structures. The noncanonical active site forms a protruding loop from the end (Ala35) of the second -strand to the beginning (Lys42) of helix R2. Hydrogen Bonding. Most of the imposed hydrogen bonds are present in the structure with a frequency greater than 80%. Four other important bonds are observed; the HN54,,, O51 bond, which appears in 70% of the calculated structures, is certainly due to the local disorder at the last turn of helix R2 that generates a bifurcated hydrogen bond for HN54. The H82,,,O79 hydrogen bond (55% occurrence) seems to stabilize the loop between R3 and 4. The HN89,,,O87 bond, which participates to the loop between the 4 and 5 strands, and the HN4,,,O52 hydrogen bond are certainly modeling artifacts due to the absence of an explicit solvent; in fact, these two latter HN protons present high temperature coefficients that are incompatible with the presence of hydrogen bonding (-9.3 × 10-3 and -7.13 × 10-3 ppm/K, respectively). -Sheet. The core of PtTrxh1 consists of a five-stranded -sheet. The individual strands comprise residues from Val6 to Cys9 ( 1), Leu28 to Thr34 ( 2), Val58 to Asp64 ( 3), Thr82 to Lys87 ( 4), and Val92 to Val96 ( 5), this last strand being interrupted by the -bulge (from Lys90 to Val92). Both parallel (p) and antiparallel (a) arrangements of the strands display the pattern 1(p) 3(p) 2(a) 4(a) 5. HN65 forms a hydrogen bond with O34 that would allow us to include Val65 in 3,

but the dihedral angles ( ) -54.4 ( 5.5° and  ) -38.5 ( 7.3°) suggest that Val65 should belong to a type III -turn from Val65 to Leu68 stabilized by the HN68,,,O65 hydrogen bond [this turn is characterized by the strong RN(65,68) NOE correlation]. The -sheet has the characteristic right-handed twist. Helices. PtTrxh1 contains four R-helices surrounding the -sheet core. The first helix, R1, extends from Val12 to Gly22 with three turns of regular R-helix. The second helix, R2, is also regular and extends from Pro39 to Lys54 (including the Pro39-Cys41 fragment of the active site). A small distortion in the axis of this helix is caused by Pro46, and this helix displays a regular helical hydrogen bond network with four turns. The third R-helix, R3, extends from Lys69 to Asn76 with two turns of regular R-helix. The fourth and last R-helix, R4, extends from Gly102 to His110, with two regular turns and with the three final residues irregularly included as an incomplete turn because of the significant flexibility of that segment (shown by an important rmsd, 0.7 ( 0.3 Å, on the last three residues) but with retention of the HN111,,,O107 hydrogen bond in 100% of the structures. ActiVe Site. PtTrxh1 possesses a noncanonical active site with the Ala35-Ser36-Trp37-Cys38-Pro39-Pro40-Cys41-Lys42 sequence, which is very well defined with a local backbone rmsd of 0.4 ( 0.1 Å (0.5 ( 0.1 Å for heavy atoms). As shown in Figure 4C, the active site forms a protruding loop outside the protein; residues Ala35-Cys38 are located on the

loop between 2 and R2 and residues Pro39-Lys42 initiating the first turn of R2 which is stabilized by both HN42,,,O38 and HN43,,,O39 hydrogen bonds. The aromatic ring of Trp37 is on the protein surface and interacts with its spatial neighboring residues (Ala35 and Met80), a strong hydrogen bond between H 37 and O66 (H 37 exhibits a temperature coefficient near 0 ppb/K) being observed in 90% of the structures. Cys38 and Cys41 are in their sulfhydryl form, and a hydrogen bond between HN41 and S38 is found in 100% of the structures (HN41 exhibits a small temperature coefficient of -1.8 × 10-3 ppm/K), stabilizing the spatial structure of the active site. Asp32, which is supposed to

facilitate the thiol deprotonation of Cys41 (20), is correctly located on strand 2 (see Table S2 of the Supporting Information for the statistical data about the active site). Aromatic Side Chains. Eight aromatic residues contribute to the structural stability of the protein hydrophobic core: Trp15 (which is specific to class I of thioredoxin h) (4), His18, Phe33, Phe48, Phe60, and Trp75 (which is specific to plant thioredoxin h, and not found in Trxh from C. reinhardtii, for example), Phe83, and Phe85. As shown in Figure 5A, residues Phe33, Phe60, Phe83, and Phe85 are located on the inner side of the -sheets and His18 and Phe48 are situated on the inner side of amphipathic helices and interact within

the hydrophobic core. Trp15 and Trp75 interact with one another (and certainly with His18) in a groove formed by helices R1 and R3. Moreover, several NOE correlations can be observed between the two Trp15 and Trp75 side chains. In addition, Phe55, which is conserved in thioredoxins (21), is positioned at the end of a groove formed by helices R2 and R4 and Phe19 in the groove between helices R1 and R3, near Trp15 and Trp75. As shown in Figure 5B, other nonaromatic hydrophobic side chains participate in the hydrophobic core. DISCUSSION Comparison with Other Known Thioredoxin Structures. Thioredoxins can be quite divergent in their primary structures, although all of the structures resolved up to date adopt the Trx fold. In that context, it is interesting to compare our solution three-dimensional structure of PtTrxh1 with other well-known thioredoxins, the closest one being thioredoxin h from C. reinhardtii (CrTrxh1) (8). The sequences of these two proteins are only 50% identical, although the overall tertiary structures are very close; the different secondary structure elements have the same size and position. As in human thioredoxin (22), the R1 and R3 helices are longer than in the bacterial thioredoxin and R3 helix is clearly identified as a regular R-helix. Also, some differences can be observed with the structure of thioredoxin h from C. reinhardtii (CrTrxh1), the N-

terminus of PtTrxh1 being much longer than that of CrTrxh1 and freely exposed to solvent. The Lys23-Lys27 loop of PtTrxh1 (located between R1 and 2) is quite different from the Lys21-Lys25 loop of CrTrxh1. In the case of PtTrxh1, Lys23-Lys27 form an irregular R-turn (stabilized by the HN25,,,O21 hydrogen bond) ending the R1 helix; this loop interacts closely with the Asp88-Leu91 one (extending from 4 to 5); for CrTrxh1, the Lys21-Lys25 loop remains unstructured. The -bulge is also more structurally defined in PtTrxh1 than in CrTrxh1, introducing slight conformational differences between the Asp88-Leu91 (PtTrxh1) and Ap87-Lys90 (CrTrxh1) loops. It was reported that CrTrxh1 is less thermostable than PtTrxh1 (5). A closer examination of the structural differences between the two proteins might explain this observation. The first idea is that Trp75 contributes to the reinforcement of the hydrophobic core, thus increasing the thermal stability. Indeed, this residue is not present in CrTrxh1 (substituted for Ala), but an experimental A74Y mutation in CrTrxh1 did not change the thermal properties of this enzyme (23). The number of hydrogen bonds in each structure shows that the -sheets in PtTrxh1 are stabilized by a greater number of hydrogen bonds than in CrTrxh1 (24), 25 instead of 20. This observation could explain the difference in thermal stability between these two proteins. Moreover, this observation supports the idea that this family

Solution Structure of Reduced Thioredoxin h1 from Poplar

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 6, 2005 2007 Thioredoxins h from subgroup I are found in the phloem sieve tubes. Since these proteins are synthesized in the companion cell, they are able to be transferred through plasmodesmata to the enucleate sieve tube elements (28). The N-terminal motif AEE, necessary for this cell to cell transfer, is a recognition sequence, and in agreement, it is largely exposed to solvent. It does not exhibit any particular conformation and seems to be particularly flexible except that the two glutamate side chains must face the solvent, allowing a possible protein-protein interaction. Moreover, the fourth following glycine residue in the sequence may increase the flexibility of the AEE fragment and its conformational adaptability. CONCLUDING REMARKS The solution structure of thioredoxin h1 from poplar described in this paper is the first reported structure of a higher-plant thioredoxin h. On the basis of the particularities of that protein, we have focused on the understanding of the structural determinants of its specificity and thermostability. Along with the similarities found between this protein and other thioredoxins, we showed its specific conformation to be mandatory for its redox activity. In that context, it will be of a great interest, by means of NMR studies, to investigate interaction mechanisms of different proteinprotein complexes involving thioredoxin h1 with other in vivo partners such as NADP thioredoxin reductase (NTR) or glutaredoxin (GRX) (29).

of protein is more stabilized by the inner -sheet disposition (and its hydrogen bonding network) than by hydrophobic packing forces. As reported above, the PtTrxh1 active site is well-defined and consists of a protruding loop between 2 and R2, including the first turn of R2. Backbone superposition between the active site of PtTrxh1 (W37C38P39P40C41) and that of E. coli Trx (W31C32G33P34C35) (25) leads to a rmsd of 0.98 Å as shown in Figure 6A. The same superposition with the active site of the oxidized CrTrxh1 give a rmsd of 1.14 Å as shown in Figure 6B. It has been reported that the difference between oxidized and reduced forms of a Trx from a given organism is negligible (26, 27). Assuming that backbone position and side chain orientations of the PtTrxh1 active site are very close to that observed in classical thioredoxins, we can conclude that the G to P mutation does not give rise to important conformational changes but leads to more rigid structural characteristics. First, the presence of a second proline in the active site seems to decrease the flexibility of the loop as revealed by a low rmsd on the Ala35-Lys42 segment; second, the portion of the active site, included in the R2 helix, adopts a more regular R-helical turn than in other structures where this turn is commonly considered to be rather loosely defined. Structure-Function Relationship. As reported below, the atypical active site adopts a classical spatial disposition, suggesting that the conformation of the Cys-X-X-Cys loop is necessary for the redox activity. The presence of a proline instead of a glycine residue may play a singular role in specificity and/or in redox potential. No explanation can be formulated about structural determinants for PtTrxh1 specificity, but the characteristics induced by Pro and/or the chemical nature of the side chains surrounding the active site probably play an important role in specificity. PtTrxh1 exhibits an important propensity to polymerize at high concentrations; this type of covalent aggregation may occur for the oxidized form of thioredoxin h, suggesting the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bridge involving a cysteine residue other than Cys38 or Cys41. The only single cysteine (Cys9) present in the PtTrxh1 sequence may participate to the formation of an intermolecular covalent bond. In fact, this cysteine is situated on strand 1 and is relatively exposed to the solvent, a position in favor of the formation of a heterodisulfide bridge.
