ABSTRACT: The solution structure of the oxidized, paramagnetic form of cytochrome b562 from Escherichia coli (106 amino acids) is here reported as obtained from 1653 meaningful NOEs (from a total of 2051 unique NOEs), 33 3JHNHR values, and 339 pseudocontact shifts. The structure displays the typical fourhelix bundle motif, and a disordered loop between helices R2 and R3, as found in the solid state. The solution structure has a conformation intermediate between the two independent solid-state molecules, although different orientations are observed for a few residues. The magnetic susceptibility tensor is similar to that of cytochrome c, which has the same ligands, although the anisotropy is somewhat smaller. This difference in the electronic structure is consistent with the thermal accessibility in cytochrome b562 of states with S > 1/2. The structure is also compared with the solution structure of the apoprotein, and some information on the role of the cofactor on the protein folding and mobility is obtained. Helix R4 seems to be the most sensitive to the chemical environment in terms of structure and mobility. The pKa values affecting the hyperfine-shifted signals are also discussed. Quite intriguing is the comparison of the structure of cytochrome b562 with the available structures of cytochromes c which display a similar folding motif and similar pKa values but very little sequence similarity.

An understanding of the role of cofactor binding to polypeptide in the folding of a protein is fundamental to our ability to design and build useful metalloproteins with defined electronic and catalytic properties. The four-helix bundle protein fold has been the subject of protein folding studies (1, 2) and also the target for metalloprotein design (3, 4). Nature has used this motif for proteins of diverse functions, including heme binding proteins (5, 6) and dinuclear iron metalloproteins (7). Cytochrome b562 (cyt b562 hereafter)1 is a monomeric, fourhelix bundle protein found in the periplasm of Escherichia coli (8). The protein of 106 residues binds noncovalently a single heme as prosthetic group. The iron ion is essentially low-spin, 6-coordinate, with methionine and histidine providing the axial ligands. The ease of overexpression of this protein in E. coli and the availability of structures for both the apo- and oxidized holoproteins have made this an excellent model system for the study of the role of cofactor binding in protein folding. As such, it is currently the subject

of investigation in several laboratories, despite the fact that its function in vivo remains unknown. The properties of this protein are highly pH dependent, and the protein is tolerant of a variety of mutations without compromising the heme binding ability. Recent studies have investigated the linkage between the stability of the cytochrome b562 polypeptide and its affinity for heme (9-11). These have highlighted the large increase in protein stability afforded by binding of heme, especially in the reduced state (10), which has been utilized for electron-transfer-induced folding studies (12). Our interest in this protein is directed toward the understanding of the large differences in properties between it and the cytochrome c primes (cyt c). The latter contain a c-type heme as the prosthetic group, the iron ion being high-spin, 5-coordinate. These cytochromes are present in photosynthetic species and are found as dimers in many species, although their 4-helical folds are highly homologous to that of cytochrome b562. The structure of the oxidized cyt b562 holoprotein has been solved by X-ray crystallography to high resolution (13). In that structure the protein is a dimer in the asymmetric unit with a significant region of intermolecular contact involving the C-terminal helix. This crystal packing may influence the structure of the protein in this important region of the polypeptide that provides one of the ligands (His 102) to the heme iron. The solution structure of the apoprotein has been determined using constraints from multidimensional NMR experiments (14). However, due to the nature of the protein in this state, only a moderate number of constraints were available for structure determination. Despite this, the structure of the apoprotein provides an interesting view of

8658 Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 27, 1999 the protein in a partially folded or molten globule state that may be relevant to the folding and assembly of the holoprotein. Here we present the solution structure of the paramagnetic, oxidized holoprotein, under similar conditions to those used for the apoprotein, obtained by NMR spectroscopy. Indeed, a description of the solution structure is also required for detailed analyses of the folding of this protein. This paramagnetic system provides another test of the methodology required to assign NMR signals and also affords additional constraints for structural definition. The resulting structure is compared with both the crystal structure of the oxidized protein and the NMR structure of the apoprotein. This is the necessary starting point for detailed structural analysis of mutants designed to mimic the functional properties of cytochrome c. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Isolation and Preparation. Unlabeled protein samples were prepared following the procedure described in (15). To prepare the 15N-labeled samples, E. coli strain TG2 cells were transformed with the plasmid pPB10 (harboring the gene of E. coli cyt b562; Barker, unpublished) and plated onto TY agarose containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin and 0.1 mg/mL glucose. Then 10 mL of 2 × TY media containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin was inoculated from a single colony, and cultured overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The inoculum was then transferred to a 2 L flask containing 1 L of minimal media with 50 µg/mL ampicillin. The culture was grown with shaking at 37 °C up to an OD600 of about 0.8, and then induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside. The culture was harvested by centrifugation after 15 h from induction. The protein was extracted from the E. coli cells as previously described (15). Significant amounts of apoprotein were found to be present in the medium and were collected by concentrating the culture supernatant through ultrafiltration. The protein samples obtained from the cell lysis and from the culture media were combined, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7. The apoprotein was then saturated with exogenous heme (Sigma), and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. From this solution, holo cyt b562 was purified as previously described (15). The minimal medium used for cultures consisted of M9 salts supplemented with MgSO4, trace metal, and vitamin solutions. The nitrogen source was 15NH4Cl (1 g/L), and the carbon source was glucose (4 g/L). The samples used for NMR spectroscopy were ca. 3 mM in protein, in 500 mM phosphate buffer. NMR Spectroscopy. All NMR spectra except the TOCSY spectra were acquired on a Bruker Avance 800 spectrometer, operating at a proton nominal frequency of 800.13 MHz. The TOCSY experiments were recorded on a Bruker Avance 600 operating at 600.13 MHz. A triple resonance 5-mm probe has been used on both spectrometers. All the experiments described below were performed on a sample at pH 4.8. In addition, 2D NOESY experiments were replicated on samples at pH 7.0 and 9.2. 3D TOCSY-15N HMQC (16) and NOESY-15N HMQC (17) experiments were recorded in H2O solution with 1024(1H) × 100(15N) × 512(1H) data points. In these experiments, the delay between the 1H 90° pulse following the mixing

Arnesano et al. period and the first subsequent 15N 90° pulse was set to 5.5 ms (1/2JNH), the mixing time was 80 ms for TOCSY-15N HMQC and 100 ms for NOESY-15N HMQC, and the acquisition was carried out by positioning the carrier frequency in the center of the amide proton region at 7.35 ppm. Spectral windows of 26, 6.5, and 12.0 ppm were used, respectively, for 15N, direct 1H dimension, and indirect 1H dimension. To detect connectivities among hyperfine-shifted signals, two 2D NOESY experiments (18, 19) with spectral widths of 90 and 15 ppm in both frequency dimensions, with a recycle time of 450 ms, and with 40 ms mixing time were acquired. In addition, 2D NOESY (18, 19) (either on the H2O or on the D2O samples) and TOCSY (20, 21) spectra were acquired with a mixing time of 100 ms and a spinlock time of 70 ms, respectively, and a recycle time of 900 ms. A DQF-COSY (22) experiment was acquired with a spectral width of 15 ppm in both dimensions. All data consisted of 4K data points in the acquisition dimension and of 1K experiments in the indirect dimension. Connectivities involving the hyperfine-shifted broad signals of the iron axial ligands were detected through 1D NOE's, using the reported methodology (23), by irradiating the signals at -8.1 and -21.1 ppm. Detection of broad signals was enhanced by acquiring spectra with the SuperWEFT pulse sequence (24, 25), using very short recycle times. The HNHA experiment (26) was performed to determine 3J HNHR coupling constants. These were used to obtain constraints for  torsion angles. The spectrum was recorded as a 200(1H) × 100(15N) × 1024(1H) data set using Pulsed Field Gradients (PFG) along the z axis. The mixing time was 100 ms. Spectral windows of 43, 13, and 13 ppm were used, respectively, for 15N, direct 1H dimension, and indirect 1H dimension. For all the experiments, quadrature detection in the indirect dimensions was performed in the TPPI mode (19), and water suppression was achieved through the WATERGATE sequence (27), except in the NOESY experiments performed to detect connectivties between paramagnetically shifted resonances, where presaturation was used. All 3D and 2D spectra were collected at 298 K, processed using the standard Bruker software (XWINNMR), and analyzed on IBM RISC 6000 computers through the XEASY program (28). Constraints Used in Structure Calculations. The solution structure was determined for the major form of oxidized cyt b562. The majority of the peaks used for the structure calculations (90%, see later) were integrated in the NOESY map acquired over the diamagnetic window at 298 K in H2O by using the WATERGATE sequence for solvent suppression. Dipolar connectivities involving hyperfine-shifted protons were integrated in the NOESY spectrum acquired over the 90 ppm spectral window. Intensities of dipolar connectivities were converted into upper distance limits, to be used as input for structure calculations, by using the approach provided by the program CALIBA (29). Connectivities measured in NOESY maps acquired with different mixing times were calibrated independently. A scaling factor for the calibration parameters was estimated and found to be comparable with that obtained from the integration of well-defined and isolated peaks occurring in both spectra acquired at different mixing times. The calibration curves

Solution Structure of Oxidized cyt b562 were adjusted iteratively as the structure calculations proceeded. The proton-proton distance constraints derived from 1D NOE's were introduced as upper distance limits of 5.0 Å. Stereospecific assignments of diastereotopic protons were obtained using the program GLOMSA (29). 3J HNHR coupling constants were converted into constraints for the backbone torsion angle , by means of the appropriate Karplus curve (26). Ambiguity between different angles corresponding to the same value of the 3JHNHR coupling constant were resolved by looking at structures obtained from PSEUDYANA (30) calculations run without the ambiguous torsion angle constraints. All angles were given a (20° uncertainty. Hydrogen bond constraints were introduced for backbone amide protons which were observed to be nonexchanging in D2O solution and that were found to be within hydrogen bond distance and to have the correct orientation with respect to hydrogen bond acceptors in structural models obtained without inclusion of these constraints. The distance between the amide proton and the hydrogen bond acceptor was constrained to be in the 1.8-2.0 Å interval by inclusion of the corresponding upper and lower distance limits in structure calculations. In addition, upper and lower distance limits of 3.0 and 2.7 Å between the N and the acceptor atoms were included in calculations. No constraints were introduced for nonexchanging amide protons for which it was not possible to unambiguously identify the corresponding acceptor. Pseudocontact shifts (pcs hereafter) were employed as additional constraints for the structure calculations (31-33). Pcs values were obtained by subtracting from the chemical shifts measured in the oxidized form of cyt b562 the diamagnetic chemical shifts calculated from a preliminary structure obtained with NOE and 3J constraints with the program SHIFT (34) using the random coil chemical shifts reported by Merutka et al. (35). No pseudocontact shift constraints were used for exchangeable protons, as it is reported that SHIFT cannot calculate accurately their diamagnetic chemical shift (34). A tolerance of 10% of the estimated pcs was used in the PSEUDYANA calculations (30) (see later) with a minimum value of 0.5 ppm for all protons. The hyperfine shifts of the heme and of the axial heme ligands (Met 7 and His 102) were not included in the calculations since they experience a nonnegligible contact shift. A total of 339 pcs constraints were used. Structure Calculations. The structure calculations were performed using PSEUDYANA (30), which is a modified version of the program DYANA (36) adapted to include pcs as additional restraints. A preliminary family of 20 conformers obtained using only the NOE constraints was used as an input model to the program FANTASIAN (37, 38) to provide the initial values of  ax and  rh. These calculations were performed for each of the 20 preliminary structures, and the average values of  ax and  rh were used as starting values in the PSEUDYANA structure calculations. The PSEUDYANA protocol needs only the initial values of the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy tensor and not its direction cosines; i.e., no specific initial orientation is provided for the tensor. A special residue, called LTNS, formed by dummy atoms is used to define the position of the metal center and the directions of the magnetic susceptibility tensor in the dihedral angle coordinate space. The dummy atoms of this residue have their van der Waals radii set to zero so that it can freely

Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 27, 1999 8659 penetrate into the protein. An upper distance limit of 0.2 Å was set between the pseudoatom defining the metal ion and the iron atom. The location of this residue and the tensor orientation were optimized during the structure calculations. After each cycle of structure calculations, the magnetic anisotropy parameters were reevaluated and used as input for the following calculation until the final values did not deviate more than 5% from the initial ones. Three cycles were needed to reach convergence. The heme group was included in the calculations by defining a new residue in the amino acid library according to the previously described procedure (39). The two axial ligands (Met 7 and His 102) are linked to the iron atom through upper distance limits of 2.35 and 2.10 Å with the sulfur atom of Met 7 and with the N 2 of His 102, respectively. This approach does not impose any fixed orientation of the axial ligands with respect to the heme. In all structure calculations, the relative weight of all classes (NOE, pcs, and J couplings) of constraints was kept equal to the default PSEUDYANA values. A total of 200 random conformers were annealed in 10 000 steps using the above constraints. The 35 conformers with the lowest target function constitute the final family. Restrained energy minimization was then applied to each member of the family using the AMBER 5.0 Package (40). The distance constraints were applied within the molecular mechanics and dynamics module of SANDER, and the pcs were included as constraints by means of the module PCSHIFTS (38). The force field parameters for the heme and its ligands, as well as the overall calculation procedure, were set up as previously reported for similar systems (39, 41). The initial values of the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy used as input in PSEUDOREM were the values on the final PSEUDYANA family. On the final PSEUDOREM family, the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy parameters deviate less than 5% from their initial values (i.e., before energy minimization). The program CORMA (42), which is based on relaxation matrix calculations, was used to back-calculate the NOESY cross-peaks and to check the validity of the structure. It has been also used to locate a few more cross-peaks between already assigned resonances. The quality of the structure was evaluated in terms of deviations from ideal bond lengths and bond angles and through Ramachandran plots obtained using the programs PROCHECK (43) and PROCHECK-NMR (44). Structure calculations and analyses were performed on an IBM SP02 parallel computer. RESULTS Sequence-Specific Assignment. This study was performed on the oxidized form of cyt b562 at a protein concentration of 2-3 mM in 500 mM phosphate buffer, at pH 4.8. In these conditions, the protein does not experience aggregation, which occurs at concentrations larger than 4 mM (45, 46). Thus, the protein provides sharp hyperfine-shifted NMR signals (Figure 1). The protein exists in solution as two species, in which the orientation of the heme groups differs by a 180° rotation around the R- axis, in the ratio of ca. 7:3 (46) and referred to as forms A and B, respectively. Besides the heme substituents and the iron axial ligands,

proton resonances from these two species differ in chemical shift at most by 0.2 ppm. However, the presence of a minor form did not prevent assignment of the major form. For a large number of residues, mainly around the heme, the two forms can be resolved, thanks to the fact that the spectra were acquired at a magnetic field as high as 800 MHz, increasing the resolution. A 1H-15N HMQC spectrum is reported in Figure 2 which shows the level of resolution achieved. We will focus hereafter on form A. Assignments in the diamagnetic region were performed through 3D NOESY-15N HMQC and TOCSY-15N HMQC experiments. The dispersion of the resonances in the 15N dimension in the 3D maps allowed us to resolve most of the connectivities in the fingerprint region, which were instead overlapped in 2D spectra. This overlap, involving mainly HR protons, can been attributed to the large content of helical structure elements (see later). The first assigned residues were glycines, due to their specific 15N chemical shifts, and threonines, alanines, and valines, as they have easily recognizable spin patterns. For some residues, the TOCSY connectivities, if not absent at all (around 10% of the residues), were restricted to backbone atoms or to the protons while those of the rest of the side chain were not detectable. This is similar to what is observed for the apo form of cyt b562 (hereafter apo cyt b562) (47). The missing resonances were assigned based on COSY spectra and/or on the analysis of the NOESY spectra in light of the structural models obtained without such assignments. The assignment spans all 106 residues, and is reported in detail in the Supporting Information. In the present oxidized form of the protein, the occurrence of one unpaired electron on the iron atom, in the predominant S ) 1/2 spin state, gives rise to paramagnetic shifted signals (45, 46). These proton resonances were easily located in the 2D NOESY experiment recorded at shorter mixing times on the larger spectral window, optimized for the detection of

connectivities among fast relaxing signals. This spectrum has been used to assign the heme resonances and some other paramagnetic shifted signals due to protons of residues in the proximity of the heme. The observed NOE pattern among heme resonances is such that it is possible to "walk" from propionate 6 to propionate 7 passing through all heme substituents, thus giving confidence in the present assignment. The -meso proton (i.e., the proton between the two propionates) could not be assigned. The assignment of the broad hyperfine-shifted signals from the axial iron ligands was achieved using 1D NOE experiments. One H proton of the axial Met was assigned to the signal at -8.1 ppm, and the H 1 proton of the histidine ring was assigned to the signal at -21.1 ppm. From 1D NOE experiments, where the latter signal has been saturated, and 1D SuperWEFT experiments, the resonance of H1 at 8.1 ppm has been located. 1D NOE experiments at 276 K allowed us to detect and assign the resonance of the CH3 of Met 7 at -6.5 ppm. The assignment of the paramagnetically shifted signals essentially is in agreement to that already reported (46), except for the R-meso proton, which is assigned at 3.7 ppm instead of -1.1 ppm, as previously reported. We have also followed the 1D NMR spectra with pH, and confirmed the previously available results (45). The pH dependence is consistent with the two reported pKa's at 6.8 and 9.0 (45). In total, 106 residues out of 106 were assigned; 85.1% and 85.0% of the expected 1H and 15N resonances, respectively, were assigned (Supporting Information). Secondary Structure from NMR Data. The elements of secondary structure can already be identified by analyzing the pattern of assigned NOEs (48). Short- and medium-range NOEs were used to generate Figure 3. In general, strands are expected to give strong dRN intraresidue and sequential connectivities and weak dNN connectivities, while helical structures can be identified by the high number of sequential

and medium-range connectivities such as dNN(i,i+1), dNN(i,i+2), dRN(i,i+3), and dRN(i,i+4), dR (i,i+3). Four elements of helical secondary structure can be predicted similarly to the characteristic secondary structure elements present in the cyt b562 crystal structure (13, 49). These are commonly referred to as helices R1, R2, R3, and R4, and in the present case they involve residues 3-21, 23-43, 55-83, and 84104. Thus, about 80% of the protein residues are involved in R-helices. The region involving residues 45-55 constitutes a long loop between helices R2 and R3. Here, the experimental NOE pattern suggests the presence of a helical structure for residues 46-51. Figure 3 also shows residues whose backbone amide protons were still observable, with full or partial intensity, after the sample had been dissolved in D2O for 3 days. Most residues in the sequential stretches formed by residues 4-20 (besides residue 6, helix R1), 26-43 (besides residue 27, helix R2), and 57-80 (besides residues 60 and 69, helix R3) are nonexchanging, or display reduced intensity due to partial exchange. This is consistent with the presence of stable R-helices in these regions, in agreement with the observed NOE patterns. For the region 84-104, for which the

experimental NOE pattern is indicative of the presence of an helical structure, only the amide protons of a few residues are not exchanging (88-91, 94-96, 99) or partially exchanging (84-85), indicating that this helix is more solventaccessible than the other three. The longest stretch of exchanging backbone amide protons is that of residues 4454 (which contains three prolines), whereas the second longest involves the C-terminus of the protein, spanning residues 100-106. Solution Structure Calculations and Secondary Structure Analysis. A total of 3527 NOESY cross-peaks were assigned, integrated, and transformed into upper distance limits with the program CALIBA. These corresponded to 2051 upper distance limits, of which 1653 were found to be meaningful (nonmeaningful distance constraints are those which cannot be violated in any structure conformation and those involving proton pairs at fixed distance). The number of NOEs per residue is reported in Figure 4. No correction has been introduced to compensate for the fact that peaks between signals that are degenerate in the two forms are stronger than peaks between resolved signals due to protons at the same distance. Neglecting the correction determines an increase

of the upper distance limits derived from the peaks between resolved signals of 6-7%, which is well below the uncertainty on such distance limits due to the integration error. It

should be noticed that despite the paramagnetism of the system, the heme protons provided 200 NOEs, while the axial ligands His 102 and Met 7 provided 30 and 24 NOEs,

respectively. Some of them have been obtained from 1D NOE. In addition to the above NOE constraints, 33 3JHNHR couplings obtained from the HNHA 3D spectrum were employed in structure calculations. Hydrogen bond constraints for 36 amide protons which fulfill the requirements described under Materials and Methods were used at later stages of structural calculations. A total of 34 proton pairs were stereospecifically assigned through the program GLOMSA. In particular, the H protons of the axial histidine were assigned stereospecifically. All the constraints used for structure calculations and the obtained stereospecific assignments are reported in the Supporting Information. The 35 conformers constituting the family obtained with the above constraints have an average target function of 0.78 ( 0.07 Å2, and a RMSD from the mean structure for the backbone atoms of residues 3-105 of 0.97 ( 0.20 Å (see later for the analysis). The structure was also calculated using pcs as further constraints (see Materials and Methods). The latter were used within the point dipole approximation, i.e., where the electron is considered localized on the iron atom. The relation between pcs and nuclear coordinates is (50):

where  ax and  rh are the axial and the rhombic anisotropies of the magnetic susceptibility tensor, ri is the distance of nucleus i from the ion, and li, mi, and ni are the direction cosines of the position vector of atom i with respect to the orthogonal reference system formed by the principal axes of the magnetic susceptibility tensor. The first use of pcs for solution structure determination dates back to 1996 (37), and a critical analysis is reported in (30, 38, 51, 52). Pcs are properly defined for the nuclei

of the residues not directly bound to the metal ion. In this case, His and Met and the heme protons are not considered. Pcs are defined as the difference between the actual shift and the shifts experienced by the same nucleus in the absence of the unpaired electron. Two points should be kept in mind in this treatment: (i) the electron is indeed delocalized on the heme moiety and on the axial ligands, thus undermining the validity of eq 1 (see below); (ii) the shifts for the species without unpaired electrons (diamagnetic shifts) can only be estimated. As reported under Materials and Methods, point (i) is overcome by introducing a tolerance proportional to the actual pcs; larger pcs, which are experienced by protons close to the paramagnetic center and are more affected by electron delocalization, are considered to have a larger indetermination. As far as point (ii) is concerned, the diamagnetic chemical shift can be calculated from the structure obtained from NOEs or from the shifts of the reduced diamagnetic protein. In the latter case the oxidized and reduced proteins are assumed not to differ in structure so much to provide a difference in the diamagnetic chemical shift larger than the indetermination of pcs. Such indetermination is reflected in the tolerance given to the pcs in the structure determination protocol. In the present case, the diamagnetic chemical shifts were calculated with the program SHIFT (34) from the energy-minimized average structure obtained from NOEs. These calculated shifts were compared with those calculated from the X-ray structure. They compare well to each other, having a mean difference of 0.05 ( 0.23 ppm, and are reported in the Supporting Information. Since such calculations provide a considerable error, a tolerance of 0.5 ppm was given to all pcs. If some pcs were wrong they would be identified as they would induce an increase in the target function of the NOEs. The new family of 35 structures obtained with the inclusion of pcs has no increase in the target function of the

NOEs (0.74 ( 0.13 Å2) with respect to the family obtained without pcs and essentially the same RMSD (0.93 ( 0.20 Å for residues 3-105). In addition, the contribution to the target function of the pcs constraints is small (ca. 0.05 Å2). The consistency of the two sets of constraints indicates that the assignment of protons is correct and the structure is reliable. The obtained family was then subjected to a refinement with the program AMBER as already reported (38). The PSEUDOREM family has an NOE and pcs penalty function of 96 ( 17 kJ mol-1, corresponding to an average PSEUDYANA NOE and pcs target function of 0.8 Å2. The average violation per NOE constraint is 0.0173 ( 0.0014 Å (Table 1). This family is taken as representing the solution structure. A superposition of the backbone atoms of the family is shown in Figure 5. Table 1 reports calculation statistics and the structure quality analysis for the final family. These low values of the target function indicate that the obtained family is in very good agreement with the experimental constraints. The average backbone RMSD from the mean structure for residues 3-105 is 0.93 ( 0.21 Å, whereas the heavy atoms RMSD is 1.39 ( 0.20 Å. These values drop to 0.42 ( 0.09 Å and 0.96 ( 0.09 Å, respectively, when the disordered region formed by residues 52-61 is excluded. The RMSD values per residue of the final family from the mean structure are shown in Figure 6. The largest backbone RMSD values are obtained for residues 52-61; the rest of the protein is, on the contrary, very well-defined, with local RMSD maxima, as usual, for the N- and C-terminal residues.

The high RMSD of residues 52-61 is due to the paucity of NOEs in this region (Figure 4). In particular, almost no longrange NOEs were obtained for residues 51-60; the highest RMSD is obtained for residue 56, which has the lowest number of NOE constraints (Figure 4). Residues 50-55 constitute the C-terminal part of the loop connecting helices R1 and R2. This loop points away from the core of the protein, making it intrinsically poor in the number of observable NOEs. In addition, this region contains two prolines, which break up the sequential connectivities. This region is also quite disordered in the X-ray structure (see later). The final family of conformers was analyzed in terms of secondary structure with PROCHECK-NMR (44). According to this program, helical structures were found for residues 3-18 (R1), 22-41 (R2), 45-49 (310), 62-82 (R3), and 83105 (R4); and in the energy-minimized mean structure, residues 3-18 (R1), 22-41 (R2), 45-49 (310), 55-82 (R3, with a break at residue 61), and 83-106 (R4). This result is similar to that obtained from the analysis of NOE patterns (see above). Only helix R3 is sizably shorter than what is expected on the basis of the sequential NOEs. From inspection of Figure 6, it can be noticed that three of the four R-helices are very well-defined, with an average backbone RMSD lower than 0.5 Å, whereas the N-terminal part of helix R3 (residues 55-60) is rather poorly defined, due to the low number of NOE constraints in this region

Solution Structure of Oxidized cyt b562

Biochemistry, Vol. 38, No. 27, 1999 8665 essentially orthogonal to the heme plane (within 2-3°). This holds both in the X-ray and in the present solution structure. Similar deviations had already been reported for other c-type cytochromes (41, 58). Once the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy tensor is available, it is possible to evaluate through eq 1 the pcs contribution to the total hyperfine shift experienced by nuclei of the heme moiety and of the axial ligands. The diamagnetic values for the heme protons, which are necessary to determine the hyperfine shifts, are taken from the previously reported shifts of reduced, diamagnetic cyt b562 (15). The diamagnetic values of the axial ligands were instead taken from average values measured in diamagnetic c-type cytochromes (59, 60), and are in excellent agreement with preliminary assignments of reduced cyt b562 obtained in this lab (not shown). When the pcs are subtracted from the total hyperfine shifts, the contact shifts are obtained. The results are shown in Table 2. The pattern of contact shifts observed for the methyls is in good agreement with what is expected on the basis of simple Huckel calculations and the present ¨ arrangement of the ligands (57). The most striking feature observed in the present system is the fairly large difference between the contact shifts of methyls 5 and 1, which are instead expected to be equal. DISCUSSION The solution structure of oxidized E. coli cyt b562 consists of four long R helices, packed together in an antiparallel fashion (Figure 5). This arrangement corresponds to the wellknown four-helix bundle topology. As can be seen from Figure 6, the largest values of the RMSD are observed for residues 51-61. Local maxima of the RMSD are also observed for the N- and C-terminal parts of the protein, as it is customary for solution structures of proteins. The heme cofactor is located between helices R1 and R4. Table 1 shows that the present PSEUDOREM structure is in very good agreement with the experimental constraints, having no violation larger than 0.3 Å. The relatively low average RMS violation of the long-range NOE constraints ensures that this class of constraints, which is the most important in defining the overall fold of the protein, has not been calibrated too tightly. Comparison with the X-ray Structure. The overall fold of the present solution structure is essentially identical to that observed in the solid state (13). The X-ray structure of cyt b562 (PDB entry 256B) showed that two nonequivalent molecules are present in the unit cell. These two molecules are slightly different, with a mean backbone RMSD for the superposition of residues 3-51 and 62-105 of 0.26 Å. The RMSD for the same region between the energy-minimized mean solution structure and the two solid state conformers is 0.94 Å for molecule A and 1.02 for molecule B. The largest differences between the two solid-state molecules are observed for the region 50-57, which is a portion of the long loop between helices R2 and R3, and for the C-terminal helix R4. The first region is highly disordered in the crystal structure, and indeed only a very weak electron density could be observed for residues 45-59 at a resolution lower than 2 Å (13). In the solution structure these residues constitute the region with the highest RMSD values (Figure 6). It is thus conceivable that this loop spans a number of

(Figure 4). Indeed, despite the poor definition, the NOE pattern indicates that segment 55-60 is part of the R3 helix. The present family of conformers has ca. 85% of the residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, and ca. 13% in the allowed regions. No residues were in the disallowed regions. In the energy-minimized average structure, 88% of the residues are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, 11% of the residues are in the allowed regions, and only 1 residue is in a generously allowed region. Magnetic Anisotropy Tensor and Contact Shift Pattern. The final  ax and  rh values are (1.60 ( 0.05) × 10-32 m3 and (-0.69 ( 0.08) × 10-32 m3, respectively. The z axis of the magnetic susceptibility tensor deviates slightly from the normal to the heme plane, making with it an angle of about 20°. The y axis makes an angle of 27° with the FeN(pyrrole I) direction. The arrangement of the tensor with respect to the heme moiety and the ligands is shown in Figure 7. It is known that the directions of the magnetic susceptibility tensor axes are determined by the relative arrangement of the side chains of the axial ligands (53). Indeed, when a single axial ligand, giving rise to an asymmetric  interaction with the metal (e.g., His), is bound to the iron ion, the y axis of the magnetic susceptibility tensor rotates counterclockwise when the His plane rotates clockwise, by essential the same angle (37, 54-56). The y axis coincides with the normal to the His plane when the latter is aligned along a N-N direction. The same would hold if a methionine were the single axial ligand, with the nodal plane of the lone pair of the sulfur taking the place of the His plane. When, as in the present case, there are two axial ligands, the two effects sum up, scaled by the relative strength of their  interaction with the iron ion. In the present case, the His plane makes an angle of about 30° with the N(pyrrole II)-N(pyrrole IV) direction, whereas the nodal plane of the lone pair of the sulfur atom of the Met makes an angle of about -5° with the same direction. By simply averaging the two rotations, one would expect the y direction of the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy tensor to make an angle of 12.5° with the N(pyrrole I)-N(pyrrole III) direction, which is in good agreement with the observed value of 27°, confirming that the  interactions with the iron ion of the two axial ligands are of comparable strength (57). The deviation of the z axis from the normal to the heme plane is rather small, consistent with the fact that both Fe-N 2 and Fe-S bonds are

alternative conformations both in the crystal and in solution, in thermodynamic equilibrium. Backbone amide hydrogen exchangeability indicates that residues 44-54, which are located just before helix R3, are solvent-accessible whereas residues 57-59 (constituting the N-terminal portion of helix R3) are not (Figure 3). This suggests that the first half of region 50-60 is more exposed than the second half. Helix R4 is well-ordered in the crystal structure (i.e., electron density could be observed for this region of the molecule), but its RMSD between the two molecules of the cell is larger than in the rest of the protein. Helix R4 is also very welldefined in the NMR structure, having an average RMSD from the mean of 0.4 Å. There is a significant deviation between the backbone conformation of helix R4 observed in solution and in the two X-ray structures, with an average RMSD of ca. 1.0 Å with respect to both solid-state molecules (when the molecules are superimposed on the backbone atoms of residues 3-51 and 62-105). Backbone amide proton exchange shows that this region is accessible to the solvent. All of these findings are consistent with the idea of helix R4 being structurally sensitive to the chemical environment. Table 3 reports a comparison of each individual secondary structure element at the time. It is readily observed that the largest local (i.e., neglecting changes due to different relative orientations of the helices) conformational rear-

rangements occurring when passing from the crystal to the solution are localized in helix R4. The conformations of several side chains of charged residues (Asp, Glu, Arg, Lys) and of Leu 76 differ sizably in the two solid-state molecules. Unsurprisingly, these side chains also show a marked displacement when comparing the crystal and solution structures. In the latter, most of them are found in conformations comparably different from those observed in each molecule of the crystal. Exceptions are observed for Glu8 and for the neutral side chain of Leu 76, which are much closer to the molecule indicated as B in the crystal structure than to that indicated as A. The side chains whose conformation is the same in the two crystal conformers, but which changes when passing to solution, are again involving charged residues. Among these, Lys 42 is experiencing a large change. This residue is located at the surface of the molecule, and forms a salt bridge in the solid-state structure with Asp 39. In solution, this salt bridge is not present, as the two side chains are extending in solution. The two molecules present in the crystal cell are in close contact with each other in region 99-103. The superposition of this region for the solution and crystal structures reveals that its local conformation is maintained when passing from the solid state to the solution. The conformation of propionate 7 in the X-ray structure is different in the two molecules (13). In solution, its conformation is rather well-defined, and it is similar to that observed in the molecule identified as B in the crystal structure (Figure 8). It is noteworthy that in this conformation the propionate is not forming any hydrogen bond to surrounding residues either in solution or in the crystal. In the A molecule of the X-ray structure, propionate 7 forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Glu 4, and with the carboxylate of Glu 8. In the present structure, the carboxylate of Glu 8 is at 8 Å from the carboxylate of propionate 7. The carbonyl oxygen of Glu 4 is at 6 Å from the propionate.

Propionate 6 is less defined than propionate 7 in the present structure, but its conformation is close to that observed in the crystal (which is very similar in the two molecules) (Figure 8). In the crystal structure, propionate 6 formed hydrogen bonds only with surrounding water molecules. Also in solution, no hydrogen bonds to the protein were observed. Comparison with the Apoprotein Structure. The solution structure of apo cyt b562 (PDB entry 1APC) (14) displays large deviations from both the X-ray and the present NMR structures of the holoprotein. Indeed, the RMSD between the present mean solution structure and the mean structure of apo cyt b562 is 3.3 Å (for the superposition of residues 3-51 and 62-105), whereas the RMSD between the latter and the X-ray structure of the holoprotein is 3.1 Å. A superposition of the present structure and that of apo cyt b562 is shown in Figure 9. The largest differences between the present structure and the structure of the apoprotein are observed for helix R1 (mean backbone RMSD for residues 3-23 of 3.1 Å), the loop (3-7 Å), and the last part of helix R4 (mean backbone RMSD for residues 82-104 of 4.5 Å). Helix R2 is the most similar between the two solution structures of the apo- and holoprotein. The above is true also for comparison between the X-ray structure of the holoprotein and the solution structure of the apoprotein (14). It is

interesting to observe that when the apo- and holoprotein solution structures are superimposed on one element of the secondary structure at a time (i.e., by best-fitting the coordinates of the backbone atoms of the residues involved in each helix or loop), helix R4 displays the largest RMSD values among the four helices (Table 3). This shows that this helix undergoes extensive local conformational rearrangements when the heme cofactor is removed from the protein. Comparison with Cytochromes c. The crystal structures of several cytochromes c from different organisms are available (Rhodopseudomonas palustris, PDB entry 1A7V; Chromatium Vinosum, PDB entry 1BBH; Alcaligenes denitrificans, PDB entry 1CGN; Alcaligenes sp., PDB entry 1CGO; Rhodobacter capsulatus, PDB entry 1CPQ, 1RCP; Rhodobacter capsulatus strain St. Louis, PDB entry 1CPR; Rhodocyclus gelatinosus, PDB entry 1JAF; Rhodospirillum molischianum, PDB entry 2CCY). The sequence identity between cyt b562 and the various cytochromes c is rather low, ranging from 10% to 20%. Among the cytochromes c, the sequence similarity is somewhat higher, with 20-50% amino acid identity (besides the Alcaligenes denitrificans and Alcaligenes sp. proteins, whose sequences differ only at four positions).

is His102 (cyt b562 numbering). Conservative substitutions are found at positions 10, 17, 89, 105, and 106. Five to nine additional residues with respect to the sequence of cyt b562 are present at the N-terminus of the cytochrome c sequences, and two to four at the C-terminus. Most of the insertions and deletions occur in the loops connecting the four helices. Despite this low homology, the two classes of proteins display an impressively similar folding, with the typical fourhelix bundle motif. The largest RMSD values between the cyt b562 solution structure and the above-mentioned cytochrome c structures are observed in the loop regions, and at the termini of the protein. If these regions are discarded, the average RMSD values for the superposition of the backbone atoms of the above structures are in the 1.5-2.5 Å range, indicating that the global fold is substantially maintained. Also the orientations of the heme cofactor and of the plane of the axial histidine in cyt b562 are the same as in the cytochrome c structures. pH-Dependent Properties of the Solution Structure. Previous studies had shown that the hyperfine-shifted signals in the 1H NMR spectra change shifts with pH, indicating the presence of two titrable groups with pKa's of 6.8 and 9.0 (45). The reduction potentials were also found to be pH dependent, with the presence of three acid-base equilibria with pKa's differing in the oxidized with respect to the reduced form (45, 61). While two groups have the same pKa's in the oxidized form as those obtained from the NMR studies (45), the third has a value below 5. On the basis of the X-ray structure (and of other spectroscopic measurements, e.g., EPR), these pKa's have been attributed to the ionization of heme propionate 7 (pKa ) 6.8) and of the iron-bound histidine (pKa ) 9.0), and possibly to the ionization of a carboxylate group for the pKa below 5. The two former pKas are relatively different from those expected for the corresponding residues. The increase in the pKa of propionate 7 was attributed to its involvement in a hydrogen bond network. The pKa of the axial histidine, on the contrary, is relatively low, which was proposed to be

due, besides to the coordination to iron(III), to the vicinity of a positively charged group. Arg 106, which in the 1.4 Å resolution X-ray structure was found at 3.7 Å from the His, can stabilize the negative charge of the histidinate anion. The pH dependence of the hyperfine-shifted signals, measured in the present study, confirmed the previous results, showing that by changing the pH from 4.8 to 7 the most affected hyperfine-shifted resonances are those of 8-CH3 and propionate 7. From the analysis of the 2D NOESY map recorded at pH 7, it appears that the folding of the protein is completely maintained at this pH. All the R-helices are still present and encompass essentially the same protein segments as at pH 4.8. In particular, helix R4, which was found to be disrupted in the apoprotein, is completely maintained. The region around propionate 7 shows changes both in terms of variation in the shift resonances and in the pattern and intensity of the NOEs. These structural changes are consistent with propionate 7 either being the ionizable group with the pKa of 6.8 or involved in an acid-base network. Indeed, propionate 7, as suggested from the X-ray structure and confirmed by the present solution structure, is close to several negatively charged groups which would increase one apparent pKa. These groups are Glu 4 (whose carboxylate oxygen atoms are at 6 Å), Glu 8 (at 7.5 Å), and, of course, propionate 6. The carboxylate moieties of Asp 2 and Asp 5 are at 5 and 7 Å from the carboxylate of Glu 4, and therefore capable of affecting one another. These titratable groups must be interacting electrostatically, with at least one of the carboxylates having a high pKa. Preliminary results suggest that the electrostatic properties in this region of the protein are little perturbed by single mutation of these acidic residues or esterification of the heme propionate groups (Barker, Fersht, and J. K. Rice, unpublished observations). This interpretation is further supported by comparison with the behavior of cytochromes c. The R. gelatinosus and C. Vinosum proteins experience also three pKa values at about 5, 6.5, and 9.5, which have been attributed, on the basis of the analysis of the NMR data (62) in light of the available

Solution Structure of Oxidized cyt b562 X-ray structures(63), to the ionization of a carboxylate group, of a propionate group, and of the axially bound histidine, respectively. In the R. molischianum (64) and R. palustris (65) cytochromes c, only the two higher pKa's were observed. The deviation of the ionization constants from the normal values for the specific moiety has been interpreted as due to the vicinity of charged groups, as proposed for cyt b562. It is quite relevant that these proteins, which adopt a similar fold despite their low homology, also exhibit a very similar ionization behavior, with residues with similar properties surrounding the ionizable groups. These observations might point to a similar biological function of these two classes of proteins. CONCLUSIONS In this paper the solution structure of oxidized cyt b562 from E. coli was solved. Despite the paramagnetism of the molecule, the quality of the structure is satisfactory, as was observed for similar proteins (52), and allows a meaningful comparison with the X-ray structure of the same protein, and with the solution structure of the apoprotein. It appears that the four-helix bundle structure is maintained, and that the loop between helices R2 and R3 is very disordered. Helix R4 is the most sensitive to the chemical environment in terms of both its structural and its dynamic properties. Propionate 7 and the acidic groups surrounding it in solution are more similar to the molecule indicated as B in the crystal structure, than to the A molecule. Despite the very low sequence similarity, the overall fold and the conformation of the ironbound histidine are found to be essentially the same in the present protein and in cytochromes c, as already noted (13). The X-ray structure of cyt b562 shows a large protein-protein interface which may lead to consideration of the system as a dimer. In solution, there is a large tendency to dimerization as the protein concentration increases (46). The known cytochromes c, except for the one from R. palustris, are also always dimers even at low protein concentration, but the protein-protein interface is more extensive, and the residues involved in the interaction are in different regions of the protein with respect to cyt b562. The high structural similarity and the low homology in the primary sequence are interesting features for the investigation of protein folding and folding prediction. In the present system, at least one high spin state for the Fe3+ ion is thermally accessible at room temperature (46), at variance with the case of cytochromes c, which have the same iron ligands. However, at the present resolution no structural strains, nor structural variation with respect to cytochromes c, possibly explaining this behavior could be observed. This implies that some small variations in the ligand field (e.g., arising from a different distortion of the heme moiety) are responsible for the different electronic structure. The tensor anisotropy and the direction of the magnetic susceptibility tensor axes are in fair agreement with the arrangement of the iron axial ligands. The magnetic anisotropy of the present system is somewhat smaller than that of cytochromes c. Finally, the pH-dependent structural properties of cyt b562 have been investigated, showing that heme propionate 7
