Heterotrimeric G proteins relay extracellular cues from heptahelical transmembrane receptors to downstream effector molecules. Composed of an subunit with intrinsic GTPase activity and a heterodimer, the trimeric complex dissociates upon receptormediated nucleotide exchange on the subunit, enabling each component to engage downstream effector targets for either activation or inhibition as dictated in a particular pathway. To mitigate excessive effector engagement and concomitant signal transmission, the G subunit's intrinsic activation timer (the rate of GTP hydrolysis) is regulated spatially and temporally by a class of GTPase accelerating proteins (GAPs) known as the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) family. The array of G protein-coupled receptors, G subunits, RGS proteins and downstream effectors in mammalian systems is vast. Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity is critical for a comprehensive mapping of the G protein system. Here, we present the 2.9 Å crystal structure of the enigmatic, neuronal G protein G o in the GTP hydrolytic transition state, complexed with RGS16. Comparison with the 1.89 Å structure of apo-RGS16, also presented here, reveals plasticity upon G o binding, the determinants for GAP activity, and the structurally unique features of G o that likely distinguish it physiologically from other members of the larger G i family, affording insight to receptor, GAP and effector specificity.
G protein GAP RGS

any extracellular cues ranging from photons to neurotransmitters are detected with high specificity by G proteincoupled receptors that in turn elicit an intracellular response by promoting GTP exchange on the subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein. The heterotrimeric G protein, composed of an subunit exhibiting endogenous GTPase activity and a heterodimeric subunit, dissociates, enabling each component to activate downstream effectors until GTP is hydrolyzed on the subunit and the heterotrimeric complex reforms. The subunit's endogenous GTP hydrolysis rate is relatively slow, therefore the cell uses GTPase accelerating proteins (GAPs) to increase the rate to suit the time scale and magnitude needed for a specific physiological response. The regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are a class of heterotrimeric G protein GAP first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sst2) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Egl10) (1, 2). Studies, both biochemical and structural, have shown an overall preference for RGS domains to bind G subunits in their transition state (mimicked by the analog GDP AlF4 ) and to accelerate GTPase activity by stabilizing the transition state of hydrolysis, thereby optimizing the endogenous GTPase activity of the G subunit without directly contributing to the hydrolytic mechanism (3­5). RGS proteins serve to quench the G protein signal temporally and spatially, either independently, or coupled (in cis or in trans) to an effector (6, 7). Thirty-seven RGS proteins have been identified in the human genome, cataloged into eight subfamilies based on the protein family the RGS domain resides delineated as RGS subfamilies R4, R7, R12, RZ, and RhoGEF RGS (rgRGS); G proteincoupled receptor kinases (GRKs); sorting nexins; and Axin (8­10). Each member displays a unique expression and localization pattern

(11). With the number of RGS proteins greatly exceeding the number of G subunits, RGS proteins are likely to be finely tuned, titrated, and localized to regulate specific signaling pathways within a G subunit's repertoire of effector targets. To mediate the specificity and fidelity requisite for accurate signal transmission, the G subunit and its binding partners (GPCR, G , RGS, and effector) must have specific reciprocating molecular determinants to minimize the convergence of independent signaling pathways. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis for G engagement with its activators, regulators, and effectors is critical for elucidating specificity determinants. RGS subfamilies pair with distinct cognate G substrates via unique stereochemical binding determinants. The RGS subfamilies R4, R7, and R12 engage G i/o (3, 12, 13); the R4 subfamily also engages G q (14); the rgRGS subfamily engages G 12/13 (15); and the RZ subfamily engages G z and G i (3, 16, 17). It is noted that G ­RGS interaction modes observed in R4, R7 and R12 (5, 7) [see accompanying article by Soundararajan et al. (18)] contrast with the unique interlocking geometry observed between p115RhoGEF rgRGS and the G 13/i1 chimera (19) and the effector-like binding mode observed between GRK2 and G q (20). G o is a member of the G i family, which includes G i1-3 and G t. Although G o is the most abundant G subunit in the human brain, little is known about the pathways it is involved in, in stark contrast to our understanding of G i1-3 and G t. Much of the work on G o to date has implicated a role for its cognate G subunit in the activation of Ca2 channels (21). Additional evidence points to G o involvement in signaling from A1adenosine receptors (22), dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) (23) and -opioid signaling (24). A G o effector molecule has been reported, GRIN1, which promotes growth cone neurite extension in the mammalian brain (25). The implicated role of G o as a mediator and regulator of core neurological and cognitive GPCR-coupled pathways positions G o as a prime target for pharmaceutical intervention. A molecular understanding of downstream signaling components is a key step toward identifying potential therapeutic points of drug intervention used

alone or in combination with GPCR-targeted drugs to minimize side effects (26). Here, we report the first crystal structure determination of G o, presented in the transition state of hydrolysis, complexed with the R4 subfamily RGS protein RGS16 (27). G o displays a number of unique determinants that likely affords it specificity in receptor, RGS, and effector engagement. We discuss the conserved nature of the RGS GAP mechanism, structural aspects that confer specificity, and the plasticity of the RGS domain required to engage and maintain binding during the transformation of G o from the GTP-bound state to the transition state by comparing the G o GDP AlF4 RGS16 complex to our independently determined structure of apo-RGS16, also presented here. The G ­RGS interactions noted in our determination of G o complexed to RGS16 dovetails with specificity findings presented in an accompanying article by Soundararajan et al. (18), facilitating the first examination of an RGS protein complexed to different G subunits. Results and Discussion
o RGS16 Complex. Mouse G o was complexed with mouse RGS16 and purified over gel filtration in the presence of GDP and AlF4 to simulate the transition state of GTP hydrolysis. The complex was crystallized in the space group P3221 with two protomers in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined by molecular replacement, using coordinates from the G i1 GDP AlF4 RGS4 structure (5) and refined to a resolution of 2.9 Å. Crystallographic, phasing, and refinement statistics are presented in supporting information (SI) Table S1. The architecture of the G o GDP AlF4 RGS16 complex resembles those observed in G i1 GDP AlF4 RGS4 and G i1/t GDP AlF4 RGS9 structures (Fig. 1) (5, 7). The RGS domain is positioned almost exclusively on the G o switches regions I and II. This is the first structural determination of the G o subunit; thus, it cannot be compared with previously solved states of G o; but, when compared with the solved structures of G i1 and G t, the G o switch conformations most closely resembles that observed in the transition state structures: G i1 GDP AlF4 and G t GDP AlF4 (28, 29). G o retains the overall domain architecture observed in previously solved G structures delineated by a Ras-like GTPase domain encompassing three nucleotide-dependent switch regions and a helical domain, inserted within the Ras-like domain and tethered by two linker regions (28, 30, 31). RGS16, like RGS4 and RGS9, is delineated by nine helices, 1­ 9, segregated into two subdomains: one formed by helices 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 and the other by helices 4, 5, 6, and 7 arranged in an antiparallel four-helix bundle (5,

7). The two subdomains are united by a conserved hydrophobic interface that constitutes the structure's core. RGS16 is a conserved member of the R4 RGS subfamily and retains central conserved elements that define RGS domains except for one component, Thr-158, which replaces the conserved isoleucine or valine found in the equivalent position across all other RGS members (Fig. S1). Thr-158 is buried in the hydrophobic core between the two subdomains. It enhances stabilization through a hydrogen bond to the residue 154 backbone carbonyl and engages the side chain of Phe-93 in a unique geometry independently confirmed by Soundararajan et al. (18).
The RGS16 GAP Mechanism. The RGS16 RGS domain engages the G switch regions via a conserved interface that buttresses their transition state conformation. The interaction is structurally similar to that observed in G i1 RGS4 and G i1/t RGS9 structures (5, 7). Although the total group of interactions between the RGS domain and the G switch regions is not identical between these pairs, key conserved RGS residues are used in identical interactions (Fig. 2A). Three critical RGS16 residues are involved near the G o active site. RGS16 Asn-90 forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of the G o Thr-183 side chain. In the G t GDP AlF4 structure, this switch I threonine is rotated 60° from switch II (29). The orientation observed in the G o RGS16 structure allows the Thr-183 side chain to contact switch II residues Lys-211 and Glu-208. This clamps switch I and II together, further stabilizing the transition state conformation from that observed in the G t GDP AlF4 structure. A second RGS16 residue, Asp-165, positioned next to switch I, forms a hydrogen bond to the Thr-183 peptide amide. This interaction orients the G o Thr-182 backbone carbonyl into the ideal geometry for hydrogen bonding to the nucleophilic water. A third RGS16 residue, Asn-130, is inserted between G o residues Lys-181 and Glu-208. Interactions with these two G o side chains dictate the orientation of the Asn-130 side chain. In this conformation, the Asn-130 side chain amide forms a hydrogen bond with the G o Gln-205 side chain carbonyl. This resolves the torsional ambiguity of the glutamine side chain, orienting it for both stabilization of the nucleophilic water and the planar intermediate. Through these means, RGS16, upon binding G o in the activated GTP-bound state, reorients G o switches and the residues involved in GTP hydrolysis from their GTP-bound state into their transition state conformation. Posttranslation modifications have been implicated in increased RGS16 GAP activity. One reported modification is palmitoylation of Cys-98 (Cys-97 in mouse RGS16) (32). Cys-97

projects off helix 4 into the RGS core. A dramatic reorganization of the RGS fold would be required for palmitoylation to occur and any resulting palmitoyl group would project toward the G subunit. A second modification, phosphorylation of Tyr-168 (Tyr 167 in mouse RGS16) was also reported to increase RGS16 GAP activity (33). The Tyr-167 hydroxyl engages the backbone carbonyl groups of Trp-61 and Arg-62 on helix 1. Tyr-167 phosphorylation would likely precipitate a torsional rotation outwards from its buried position. No apparent contacts between phospho-Tyr-167 and a G subunit would be predicted, but allosteric modulation of RGS16 GAP activity may result.

G ­RGS Specificity Determinants. Interactions between the RGS domains and G subunits determined to date are centered primarily on G switch regions I and II. Residues in switches I and II that contribute to RGS binding are nearly invariant across G subunits and do not vary at all across G i members G o, G i1, G i2, G i3, and G t (Fig. S2). Outside the G i family, RGS specificity is likely to be modulated by the substitution of a lysine at position 181 (relative to G o) with either a proline or alanine as found in G q and G 12/13 family members or a leucine as found in the RGS-GAP incompetent family G s. RGS­G interactions, however, are not limited exclusively to the nucleotide-dependent switch regions, but may also involve electrostatic interactions with components of the helical domain (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2) (7). A higher degree of variation, both within the composition of the G helical domain and the RGS residues that contact it, provides a platform for specificity proximal to, but independent of, the nucleotide-dependent switch regions. G ­RGS complex structures determined to date have all used different G subunits and different RGS members. In an accompanying article by Soundararajan et al. (18), the human cognate pair G i1 RGS16 is presented, enabling us to directly compare the interactions between G i family members (G i1 and G o) bound to the same RGS member. Analysis of contacts between RGS16 and G i members shows that a core set of interactions involving 11 pairs of residues is constant for both G i1 and G o (Fig. 2B). A number of G i1­RGS16 pairs are unique, including interactions formed between Arg-236­Asp137 and Arg-90­Glu-135. In the latter pair, an arginine, specific to G i1 and G i3, spans the interaction distance that could not be attained by the equivalent G o residue, Thr-90. Unique G o­RGS16 interactions include an interaction with the GTPase domain Thr-182­Asp-165; interactions with the helical domain including A residues Asp-65­Lys-172, Ser-75­Lys-164, and Arg-86­Glu-134; and an interaction between RGS16 Lys164 and Thr-117 on the G o B­ C loop. In addition, residues are used in van der Waals contacts between G o and RGS16, including G o His-236 (an alanine or valine residue in G i family counterparts) that contacts the side chain of RGS16 Asp-132 forming a 4 Å electrostatic interaction between its N group and the Asp-132 carbonyl. As discussed below, prime differences between G o and G i1 reside in the helical domain, specifically in terms of side chain diversity and the organization of the B­ C region. The differential set of interactions between RGS16 and G o vs. G i1 is reflected in the total area of solvent accessible surface buried upon complex formation. Analysis of the two G i1 RGS16 structure protomers shows each complex burying 738 Å2 and 802 Å2, respectively. In contrast, G o RGS16 structure protomers bury 897 Å2 and 873 Å2, respectively, an average of 115 Å2 more than those observed in the G i1 RGS16 structures, the majority of the differential due to RGS domain­G o helical domain contacts. The G helical domain's role in conferring specificity is likely to be one of a number of factors involved. Although binding determinants between the helical domain and the RGS domain 7 and 8 helices have been observed in G i1 RGS4 (5), G t/i1 RGS9 (7), and the G i3 RGS8 and G i3 RGS10 structures (see ref. 18), no contacts were observed between the G helical domain and the RGS domain in the G i1 RGS1 and G i1 RGS16 structures. Conformational Changes in RGS16. The independently determined

structure of RGS16 alone and in complex with G o allows analysis of any conformational changes that occur upon binding the G o subunit. A least-squares fitting of the two RGS16 structures over the RGS domain shows little variation in the backbone of the segments that contact G o (Fig. 3). Minor movement is noted along the backbone at the 7­ 8 linker and N-terminal to 6. Examination of the RGS16 backbone outside

the binding region shows a minor reorientation of the N- and C-terminal subdomain formed by 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 . In the apo state, this region is pivoted away from the G o binding face. This is primarily due to movements in 1, 2, and 9. The N- and C-terminal subdomain is more highly ordered in the apo state with electron density evident for more residues at the N and C termini, potentially indicative of subdomain plasticity when complexed with G o. RGS16 side chains involved in G o switch stabilization undergo a variety of conformational changes. Residues along 3 and 4, including Glu-85, Phe-86, Glu-89, and Asn-90 undergo modest changes in orientation. In contrast, significant conformational changes are noted for Glu-125 and Asn-130 with large torsional movements ( 120° for Asn-130) to facilitate hydrogen bonding to cognate G o residues. The reorientation of Asn-130 is likely coupled to movement of its binding partner, the G o residue Gln-205. The corresponding residue in G t (Gln-200) was observed to undergo a conformational change between the GTP-bound state and the transition state (29). RGS16 may recognize the key G o residue Gln-205 in the active GTP-bound state and dynamically reposition it into the transition state observed in the G o GDP AlF4 RGS16 structure. RGS16 side chain movements of note also occur along the 6 helix, including His-133 and Glu-134 and along the 1 helix, where the Leu-161 side chain rotates toward the binding interface interior, and Asp-165 and Arg-169, linked in a stabilized triad with Glu-85 via the Arg-169 -guanido group. This triad undergoes a planar shift of their hydrogen-bonding network facilitated by a rearrangement of Arg-169 into an alternative rotamer via rotations along the C ­C and C ­N bonds. The orientation of this triad mediates the critical interaction between

the independently determined structures of RGS16 in the companion article by Soundararajan et al. (18). Domain and side chain rearrangements are a key mechanistic feature of the RGS domain. Although the RGS domain has the highest affinity for G in the transition state, it must be able to recognize and bind the activated GTP-bound state and maintain engagement as it reconfigures the complex into the transition state. Subsequently, after releasing G -GDP, it must reconfigure, priming itself for subsequent engagement of another activated G subunit.
o. G o is a member of the G i family and is most closely related to G i1 (34, 35). A comparison of identical vs. nonidentical residues between G o and the G i family shows that the majority of differences occur in the helical domain, primarily in the B helix and the B­ C loop (Fig. 4C and Fig. S2). Although no evidence exists that the helical domain serves any function in regard to effector coupling, the differences between G o and G i1 raises that possibility. A least-squares fitting of the two molecules reveals a large difference in the B­ C region. The difference relative to G i1 and G t is primarily the result of a proline insertion N-terminal to C, displacing the B­ C region 6 Å from its comparable position in G i1 and G t (Fig. 4 A and B). Temperature factors for this region of G o are slightly elevated above the average main chain temperature factor, likely indicative of mobility within this region. The B­ C region is a central point of divergence among G subunits, particularly for the G 12/13 family caused by insertions in the B­ C loop (Fig. 1B). The structures of chimeric G i/12 and G i/13 with intact G 12 and G 13 helical domains reveal a loop for G 12 and an additional helix for G 13 that extends from B and C toward the switch regions of the GTPase domain (Fig. 4B) (36). It is likely that diversity within the B­ C region is a critical element for GEF, effector, and GAP specificity given its proximity to the nucleotide-dependent switch regions. In strong support for this observation is the finding that GoLoco guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) motifs target G subunits with specificity determinants mediated by the G helical domain and the GoLoco C-terminal region. GoLoco motifs from RGS12, RGS14, and AGS3 exert GDI activity on G i1-3 but not G o (37­39). The helical domain's role as a determinant in GDI GoLoco specificity was confirmed through analysis of a G i1­G o chimera in which the helical domain of G i1 was replaced with the G o helical domain, thus preventing GoLocomediated GDI activity on the G i1 GTPase domain (39). To delineate residues that functionally distinguish G o from other G i family members, we mapped residues that are identical across G i1-3 and G t but are not identical in G o and a second tier of residues that are identical across G i1-3 but are not identical in G o (Figs. 1B and 4C). The majority of residues unique to G o under these criteria map to the helical domain along the B­ C region. Additional unique residues reside on the opposite face of the G subunit, although most also diverge from G i1-3 in G t. Although the nucleotide switch regions are highly conserved, a number of unique residues occur in G o including Asp-218 in switch II and Gln-233, His-236, Thr-250, and Thr-251 in switch III. The threonine residues on switch III reside proximal to RGS16, implicating them as key nucleotidedependent determinants for effector­GAP coupling. His-236 of switch III (alanine or valine in G i family counterparts) engages

RGS16 as mentioned above, contributing van der Waals contacts and electrostatic interactions with RGS16 Asp-132. Gln-233 is buried between the GTPase domain and the helical domain. Asp-218 of switch II (a glycine in G i family counterparts) is solvent exposed, and, although distal to the RGS domain (14 Å separation), it may also contribute to nucleotide-dependent effector­GAP coupling determinants. Conclusion The heterotrimeric G protein subunit is a molecular switch efficiently designed to transmit signaling information from upstream receptors to downstream effectors with high fidelity. G protein subunits must orchestrate a unique signal transduction pathway amidst hundreds of G protein-coupled receptors and scores of downstream effectors. Functionally, this requires the encoding of higher level specificity. The requirements placed on the G subunit include time-dependent activation (endogenous GTPase activity), conformational change to regulate binding partners (nucleotide-dependent switch regions), and binding specificity (unique structural determinants). To regulate subunit activation temporally and spatially, GAP proteins, including members of the RGS family, are used to bind and enhance the subunit's endogenous GTPase activity. Although RGS proteins quench G protein activity in vitro, it is critical at the cellular level to ensure signal transmission to downstream effectors before inactivation. This paradigm is best illustrated in the visual system where effector­GAP coupling between phosphodiesterase and RGS9-G 5 ensures efficient, temporally regulated G t-mediated signal transmission. To extend this paradigm to other G subunits, specific effector binding determinants proximal to and nonoverlapping with the subunit's RGS binding domain are critical. As illustrated in our structure of G o and by comparison with G i and G 12/13 family members, the subunit's helical domain is a key component with all of the requisite features to facilitate specificity in both effector­GAP coupling and receptor-mediated GEF activity. Highly enriched in the brain, G o likely engages a variety of RGS proteins across anatomical regions, each RGS pairing honed to desensitize G o on time scales calibrated for specific neuronal and cognitive tasks. RGS16 localization is specific for the principal relay and midline/intralaminar thalamic nuclei and hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, sites critical for circadian rhythms and processing sensory input (40). RGS16 and G o are uniquely positioned to modulate information dissemination in the brain. Analysis of RGS16 knockout mice or use of inhibitors specifically designed to perturb G o or RGS16 function will provide great insight into the neuronal mechanisms the pair govern.
