Abstract a-Conotoxin PIA is a novel nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist isolated from Conus purpurascens that targets nAChR subtypes containing a6 and a3 subunits. a-conotoxin PIA displays 75-fold higher affinity for rat a6/a3b2b3 nAChRs than for rat a3b2 nAChRs. We have determined the three-dimensional structure of a-conotoxin PIA by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The a-conotoxin PIA has an ``x-shaped'' overall topology as other a4/7 subfamily conotoxins. Yet, unlike other neuronally targeted a4/7-conotoxins, its N-terminal tail Arg1-Asp2-Pro3 protrudes out of its main molecular body because Asp2-Pro3-Cys4-Cys5 forms a stable type I b-turn. In addition, a kink introduced by Pro15 in the second loop of this toxin provides a distinct steric and electrostatic environment from those in a-conotoxins MII and GIC. By comparing the structure of a-conotoxin PIA with other functionally related a-conotoxins we suggest structural features in a-conotoxin PIA that may be associated with its unique receptor recognition profile.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligandgated ion channels activated by the endogenous neurotransmitter acetylcholine and the tobacco plant alkaloid nicotine [1,2]. In mammals, 11 different neuronal nAChR subunits have been cloned. These homologous subunits combine with a variety of possible subunit combinations in a pentameric complex to form an ion channel. The receptor subunits are widely expressed throughout the nervous system; nevertheless, there is distinct regional expression of various subunits. The subunit compositions of nAChRs determine a number of pharmacological and functional properties, including affinity for agonist and antagonist, agonist efficacy, and desensitization rates [1]. The ability to discriminate among a variety of subtypes

of nAChRs is important for drug development to treat pain, memory disorders, ParkinsonÕs disease, schizophrenia, and nicotine addiction. The a6 subunit of nAChR is expressed in catecholaminergic neurons and in retina [3,4] and appears to be central to important physiological and possibly pathological conditions. For example, the a6b2* (asterisk indicates the possible presence of additional subunits) nAChRs seem to play a key role in the modulation of dopamine release [5] and are significantly reduced in primate 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) models of ParkinsonÕs disease [6]. Conus is a large genus of predatory snails that feed on fish, snails, and marine worms [7]. Their venoms are complex, often containing hundreds of different peptides. These peptides are notable for their small size, potency, and target receptor subtype selectivity. One of the most common types of peptides across the 500 different species is the

a-conotoxins, a series of structurally and functionally related peptides that act as antagonists of the nAChR [8]. a-Conotoxins may act at the muscle subtype, a7-homomers, a3b2, a3b4, a6b2b3, or at a6b4 subunit combinations of nAChR (Table 1) [8]. The a6 subunit of nAChR is highly homologous with a3 subunit, having sequence identity of $80% in the ligand-binding extracellular domain [9]. a-Conotoxin PIA is the first conotoxin ligand to discriminate between nAChRs containing closely related a6 and a3 subunits [10]. It has an unusual preference for a6 versus a3 subunit and potently blocks rat a6/a3b2b3 nAChRs with a $75-fold lower IC50 than rat a3b2 and blocks rat a6/a3b4 nAChRs with a $17-fold lower IC50 than rat a3b4 nAChRs. Generation of more selective antagonists for discriminating among nAChRs containing a6 and a3 subunits is particularly challenging but potentially valuable for the treatment of ParkinsonÕs disease. There are five known subfamilies of nAChR-targeting conotoxins. The a4/7 subfamily, like the a4/3 and a4/4 subfamilies, targets neuronal nAChRs with the exception of a-conotoxin EI (Table 1). Such a characteristic of the a4/7 subfamily differs from that of the a3/5 or aA subfamilies that target neuromuscular nAChRs. In this report, we describe the solution structure of a-conotoxin PIA, the first a-conotoxin that binds preferentially to a6 subunit containing nAChRs over a3 subunit containing subtypes. Materials and methods
Peptide preparation. a-Conotoxin PIA, originally purified from the venom of Conus purpurascens, was synthesized and purified as previously described [10]. The mass of the peptide was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. NMR experiments. Samples for the NMR studies were prepared in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O with a final concentration of 10 mM at pH 3.92. The pH was measured as a direct reading from a combination microelectrode calibrated at two reference pHs. All NMR experiments were performed using a Varian UNITY INOVA 600 spectrometer at 10 and 20 °C in order to obtain unambiguous resonance assignment. Mixing times of 100­400 ms for NOESY and 87 ms for TOCSY experiments were used. The 3JHNHa Table 1 a4/7 subfamily of nAChR-targeting conotoxins

coupling constants for backbone torsion angles were measured using phase-sensitive double-quantum-filtered COSY experiments. Typical twodimensional NMR data consist of 2048 complex points in the t2 dimension with 256 complex t1 increments. Spectral widths were 8 kHz in both dimensions. All NMR data were processed and analyzed on a Sun SPARCstation using a Varian Vnmr software and an nmrPipe/nmrDraw software. Structure calculations. Interproton distance restraints used for structure calculation were derived primarily from the NOESY spectrum recorded with a mixing time of 200 ms obtained at 10 °C. The Sparky program was used for peak picking and quantification of NOE volumes. The NMR-derived NOE restraints included 200 unambiguous NOE-derived interproton distance restraints [84 intraresidue, 63 sequential, 38 medium-range (|i À j| 6 3), and 15 long-range (|i À j| P 4) inter-proton restraints]. The 10 dihedral angle restraints were derived from 3JHNHa coupling constants. Backbone torsion angle / was set to À120° (±20°) when 3JHNHa > 8 Hz and to À65° (±20°) if 3JHNHa < 6 Hz. Using these experimental restraints, a family of 50 structures were calculated using the simulated annealing and energy minimization protocols within CNS_SOLVE 1.1 [11]. Out of 50 structures calculated, 20 low energy structures of a-conotoxin PIA were selected and a quality analysis of them was performed using the program PROCHECK [12].

Results NMR spectroscopy Resonance assignment for a-conotoxin PIA was accomplished using 1H homonuclear two-dimensional NMR methods by following the standard sequential resonance assignment strategy [13]. An unambiguous assignment of His13 was possible in TOCSY spectra without relying on the NOE connectivity information due to its unique ``back-transfer'' crosspeaks. Resonances of Pro3, Pro8, Val9, Pro15, and Ile17 were assigned based only on the COSY and TOCSY spectra following their characteristic coherence transfer patterns. For the other residues, classification of spin systems in a TOCSY spectrum along the backbone NH resonances preceded the sequential resonance assignment procedure. Strong sequential dad type NOE cross peaks representing interproton distances of less ° than 2.5 A were clearly observed for all the prolines (Pro3, Pro8, and Pro15), indicating that they are in trans configuration. Due to trans­cis isomerization of prolines minor peaks originating from a cis conformer were noted. Similar cis conformers have been observed in other a-conotoxins as well [14,15]. Detailed analyses of NMR data and structure calculation were carried out for the trans isomer. Shown in Fig. 1 are short- and medium-range NOEs used for the resonance assignment, 3JHNHa, and chemical shift index (CSI) [16] along the amino acid sequence of a-conotoxin PIA, where presence of secondary structure elements including an a-helix in the middle of the molecule and a few short turns near the termini is visible. Structural characteristics of a-conotoxin PIA Fig. 2 is the final ensemble of 20 superimposed structures of a-conotoxin PIA. The overall statistics for structure calculation summarized in Table 2 show that the

structure is well defined. The quality evaluation by PROCHECK [12] indicates that 85.8% and 14.2% of backbone dihedral angles of all non-glycine and non-proline residues reside within the most favored region and additional allowed region of the Ramachandran plot, respectively. The backbone fold of a-conotoxin PIA is x-shaped, a common structural characteristic of a4/7 a-conotoxin subfamily. Detailed secondary structure analysis by PROMOTIF [17] reveals that the residues Asp2-Cys5, Pro3-Ser6, and Cys4-Asn7 constitute three consecutive type I b-turns whereas the residues Asn14-Ile17 and Pro15-Cys18 form type IV b-turns. Notable in the structure of a-conotoxin PIA is the N-terminal extension (Asp2-Pro3-Cys4) that forms a type I b-turn (Fig. 2) and protrudes out of its main molecular body, a feature not observed in other a-conotoxins. Found at the bottom of the overall x-shaped fold is a two-turn a-helix composed of residues Val9-Asn14 (Fig. 4). A hydrophobic face along this amphipathic a-helix is formed by Pro8, Val12, and Pro15 seen on the front side of the molecule. The hydrophobicity of this face is augmented

by Val9 on the back side of the molecule. This hydrophobic surface is surrounded by several hydrophilic residues such as Asn7, Cys10, His13, and Asn14 on the back side and Thr11 on the front side of a-conotoxin PIA. The Gln16 of a-conotoxin PIA lies at the molecular plane of Fig. 4 and protrudes horizontally to the right when viewed from the front. Another interesting structural feature of a-conotoxin PIA is associated with the fact that the 5th residue in its second loop is a proline. Approximately half of the neuronal a4/7 conotoxins have a proline at the same position (Table 1). Yet, among three neuronal a4/7 conotoxins (MII, GIC, and PIA) targeting a6/a3 subunit containing nAChR subtypes a-conotoxin PIA is the only one that has a proline

(Pro15) at this position. A kink in the backbone produced by Pro15 generates a surface pattern that is different from those in a-conotoxins MII and GIC [18,19]. Shown in Fig. 3 is the backbone superimposed structures of six a4/7 subfamily conotoxins. Residues 4­18 of a-conotoxin PIA are superimposed with residues 4­18 of a-conotoxin EI and 2­16 of the other a4/7 members. The ° backbone RMSDs over the aligned region are 0.80 A ° with PnIA with EI (PDB code: 1K64) [20], 0.92 A ° ° (1PEN) [21], 1.02 A with MII (1M2 C) [18], 1.13 A with ° with GID (1MTQ) [22], GIC (1UL2) [19], and 1.57 A respectively. Despite their similar backbone topology these toxins display different receptor selectivity profiles (Table 1) as the x-shaped backbone fold serves only as a scaffold orienting various side chains towards certain directions that would be favorable for appropriate interactions with particular nAChR subtypes [14,19,20]. As mentioned above, a-conotoxin PIA has an extended Arg-Asp-Pro triad at its N-terminus which protrudes out of its main x-shaped molecular framework. Two other members of the a4/7 subfamily, EI and GID, have similar extended N-terminal tails, which however do not form a stable secondary structure [19,20]. While the Nterminal tail sequences of these three a-conotoxins differ from one another, it is interesting that all contain a common Arg-Asp motif. Structure comparison among three functionally related a-conotoxins PIA, MII, and GIC So far, three a4/7 conotoxins, MII, GIC, and PIA, have been discovered to target nAChRs containing both a6 and a3 subunits (Table 1). Among these only a-conotoxin PIA prefers a6 subunit to a3 subunit by nearly two orders of magnitude [10]. a-conotoxins MII and GIC fail to distinguish between the two nAChRs. Upon superposition of the residues 4­18 of a-conotoxin PIA with the residues 2­16 of a-conotoxins MII and GIC, the backbone RMSDs ° are 1.02 and 1.13 A, respectively. Superimposition of the

residues 9­14 of a-conotoxin PIA, that form an a-helix at the bottom of the x-shape, with the residues 7­12 of the other two toxins gives backbone RMSD values of 0.65 ° and 0.49 A, respectively. Therefore, other than the protruding N-terminal tail of a-conotoxin PIA the overall structures of three a-conotoxins are similar. Nevertheless, when analyzed for detailed surface properties three toxins display similarities as well as differences as shown in Fig. 4. A prominent contiguous hydrophobic cluster is present in common at the lower left part of the front side of all three toxins (left panel in Fig. 4), which probably represents one structural factor enabling binding of these toxins to both a6 and a3 subunits. This hydrophobic cluster is formed mainly by the hydrophobic residues in the first loop of these toxins and in fact exists in all neuronal a4/7 conotoxins. The hydrophobic cluster in a-cono-

toxin PIA, however, is larger than that in a-conotoxin MII or GIC because of its Pro15. Furthermore, this particular proline introduces a kink in the second loop of a-conotoxin PIA. In the right panel of Fig. 4 where the back side of three a-conotoxins is shown one finds Leu15 of a-conotoxin MII and Ile15 of a-conotoxin GIC at the upper left part of the molecule. In the case of a-conotoxin PIA, however, one cannot find a similar hydrophobic residue. Instead, a hydrophilic Gln16 is situated near the corresponding position despite the fact that Ile17 in a-conotoxin PIA corresponds, in terms of amino acid sequence, to Leu15 of a-conotoxin MII and Ile15 of a-conotoxin GIC. Hydrophilic faces on the front side of a-conotoxins MII and GIC are similar, but Ala9 in a-conotoxin GIC makes the size of its hydrophilic face smaller than that in a-conotoxin MII. In a-conotoxin PIA, the size of this

hydrophilic face is even smaller due to Pro15 and Ile17 (Fig. 4). On the back side, the hydrophilic face in a-conotoxin GIC is formed by three residues, Asn11, Asn12, and His14, whereas that in a-conotoxin MII by two residues Glu11 and His12. The hydrophilic region at the back of a-conotoxin PIA is long stretched including Gln16. The N-terminal tail of Arg1-Asp2-Pro3 in a-conotoxin PIA sticks out prominently. Discussion Notwithstanding the significance of the recent EM ° image of nAChR at 4 A resolution [23] and the high resolution X-ray structures of AChBP, a soluble homolog of the extracellular domain of nAChR [24,25], a high-resolution three-dimensional structure of the nAChR itself by X-ray crystallography or by NMR spectroscopy is not available to date. Two main strategies have been used to delineate the mechanism of nAChR­ligand interactions without relying on direct structural knowledge of the nAChR. One has been to delineate receptor residues that interact with ligands and the other has been to delineate pharmacophores in ligands that make contact with receptors. A large number of potentially important ligand-binding residues have been suggested by producing receptor mutants and testing their ligand-binding characteristics or by using ligands to affinity label receptors [26,27]. In particular, several conserved residues in the a-subunits of nAChR or in AChBP such as Tyr89, Trp143, Tyr185, Cys187, Cys188, and Tyr192 (AChBP sequence numbering) have been identified. Four of these (Tyr185, Cys187, Cys188, and Tyr192) belong to the so-called cholignergic receptor fragment encompassing residues 180­205 [28]. Double mutant cycle analysis was particularly powerful since it points out critical residues both in the receptor and in the ligand [29]. In addition, several residues from non-a subunits of the nAChR located in the complementary face of the ligand binding subunit interface were also suggested to influence ligand binding [30,31]. As these non-a subunit residues are more variable than those from a subunits they are likely to be associated with specific binding to a particular nAChR subunit. Most of these residues suggested by the receptor modification strategy appear to be capable of directly influencing ligand binding as they are present in close proximity to pharmacophores of various ligands as shown in the recent homology modeled structures of nAChRs [32] and in the X-ray structure of an AChBP with a bound a-conotoxin PnIA [24]. Another strategy for studying nAChR­ligand interactions has been to determine high-resolution structures of nAChR ligands themselves and identify potential receptor-contacting pharmacophores within these ligands [14,15,28]. Such an approach is possible since most nAChR ligands are small and are relatively easily amenable to structural analysis by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. A quaternary ammonium moiety or hydrophobic motifs in acetylcholine, nicotine, epibatidine

or tubocurarin and a positively charged residue in the second loop of neuromuscular a3/5 conotoxins were shown to make important contribution to receptor binding via p-cation or hydrophobic interaction [28,30]. Structures of a-conotoxins and their analogs have been solved mostly by NMR [14,15,18­20,33]. While information generated by this approach is restricted to the ligands, nevertheless, these structures obtained at high resolution have been useful in several aspects. First, a common two-turn helix motif at the bottom of the x-shaped fold of a4/7 subfamily conotoxins was identified as a common backbone scaffold for proper receptor recognition [14,19,20]. Second, superposition of structures of a4/7 subfamily conotoxins, a3/5 conotoxins, and aA-conotoxins along with the structures of snake toxins has helped to predict the size of the ligand-binding pocket to be ° ° ° $20 A · 20 A · 15 A [20], which has been confirmed by other independent methods [23]. Third, the presence of a common a-subunit selective face that is composed of the first loop hydrophobic residues of a-conotoxin has been delineated [15,19,20]. The recent AChBP-bound structure of PnIA [24] shows that there is a strong hydrophobic interaction between the first loop of the a-conotoxin and aromatic residues from the a subunits of nAChR such as Tyr89, Trp143, and Tyr192 that form the primary face of the ligand binding pocket. Fourth, comparative structural analysis among a-conotoxin structures with similar or different receptor recognition profiles suggested residues of a-conotoxins potentially important for specific binding of a particular a-conotoxin to a particular nAChR subtype [14,15,19,20]. For example, mutation of Glu11 in a-conotoxin MII suggested by comparative structural analysis indeed affects receptor binding of a-conotoxin MII [9]. Yet, it appears that receptor binding, in particular, the subtype selectivity of a-conotoxins is extremely subtly controlled by minute differences in their surface characteristics, making it difficult to establish a straightforward correlation between the structure of an a-conotoxin and its receptor recognition profile. Proposed critical residues of a-conotoxins serve as priority guides when generating analogs of a-conotoxins and are not conclusive until confirmed by generation of many a-conotoxin analogs with relevant mutations and testing their receptor binding profiles, which often involve substantial effort. Taken together, structural studies on a- and aA-conotoxins have enabled one to propose a tentative nAChR­ligand binding model that accounts for the facts that the ligand binding pocket in nAChR consists of two faces, primary and complementary, and that a- and aA-conotoxins have a common hydrophobic face interacting with the a subunits of nAChR. Completion of this model would require accurate determination of receptor residues and pharmacophores in a-conotoxins that determine receptor subtype specificity of a particular a-conotoxin. Table 3 shows that the affinities of a-conotoxins, PIA, MII, and GIC, for a6 subunit containing nAChR subtype are similar ($1 nM). On the other hand, the affinity of

a-conotoxin PIA for the a3b2 nAChR subtype is substantially lower (75 nM). The preference of a-conotoxin PIA towards a6 subunit containing nAChR subtypes is not due to its higher affinity for the a6 subunit, but to its lower affinity to a3 subunit containing nAChRs. As the four residues in the first loop of a-conotoxin PIA, Ser-Asn-ProVal, are exactly the same as that in a-conotoxin MII and very similar to that in a-conotoxin GIC the reduced a3 subunit affinity of a-conotoxin PIA must be caused either by the N-terminal tail residues or by differences in its second loop. Removal of the N-terminal tail from a-conotoxin GID significantly reduces its ability to block the a4b2 nAChR subtype [22]. Noting the fact that the N-terminal tails in a-conotoxins GID and PIA protrude out (Fig. 3), one may expect a similar reduction in receptor binding when the N-terminal tail in a-conotoxin PIA is truncated. Such an expectation is supported by the recent result which shows that when a-conotoxin PnIA is bound to AChBP [24] its N-terminus points towards the primary face of the ligand binding pocket. It is reasonable that a long N-terminal tail of a-conotoxin PIA, which is absent in a-conotoxin PnIA, influences receptor binding by interacting with the primary face of the ligand binding pocket. Amino acid sequences in the extracellular domains of an a3 and an a6 subunit differ most ($20 sites) along residues 120­180 which precede the C-loop cholinergic receptor fragment that is critically involved in ligand binding. A bulky charged N-terminal protrusion in a-conotoxin PIA may disfavor its binding to an a3 subunit without affecting its interaction with an a6 subunit as the N-terminal tail of a-conotoxin GID affects its binding only to an a4 subunit without changing its affinity to a7 and a3 subunits [22]. In the case of a-conotoxin EI, its N-terminal tail bends

towards its C-terminus (Fig. 3) and hence lies proximal to the complementary side of the ligand binding pocket formed by non-a subunits of nAChR. Such an orientation of the N-terminus of a-conotoxin EI seems to be associated with its higher affinity to a d subunit of Torpedo nAChR than a c subunit. Other neuromuscular a-conotoxins which do not have such an N-terminal tail show higher affinity towards a c subunit of Torpedo nAChR. In terms of the three-dimensional structure, three residues, Thr11, His13, and Gln16 (not Ile17) in a-conotoxin PIA occupy the same locations as His9, Glu11, and Leu15 in a-conotoxin MII, respectively. These three residues of a-conotoxin MII were shown to be critical for discriminating between a3 versus a6 subunits in a previous alanine scanning study as summarized in Table 3 [9]. The fact that a kink produced by Pro15 in a-conotoxin PIA alters the spatial position of Gln16 and Ile17 supports an idea that an altered surface environment of a-conotoxin PIA may be responsible for its reduced affinity for a3 subunit containing nAChRs. Gln16 of a-conotoxin PIA is exposed outside of the a-conotoxin MII surface when a comparative surface exposure strategy is applied to a-conotoxins PIA and MII by superimposing the first loop Cys5-Cys10 segment (data not shown).
