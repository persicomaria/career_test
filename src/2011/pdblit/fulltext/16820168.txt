Abstract Sarcosine oxidase from Corynebacterium sp. U-96 is a heterotetrameric enzyme. Here we report the crystal structures of the enzyme in complex with dimethylglycine and folinic acid. The a subunit is composed of two domains, contains NAD+, and binds ° folinic acid. The b subunit contains dimethylglycine, FAD, and FMN, and these flavins are approximately 10 A apart. The c subunit is in contact with two domains of a subunit and has possibly a folate-binding structure. The d subunit contains a single atom of zinc and has a Cys3His zinc finger structure. Based on the structures determined and on the previous works, the structure­function relationship on the heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase is discussed. Ó 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The concentration of serum creatinine is widely used as an indicator of renal function [1]. Sarcosine oxidase (SO) [sarcosine: oxygen oxidoreductase (demethylating), EC 1.5.3.1] has been used in the enzymatic determination of creatinine in the clinical laboratory. SO has been isolated from various bacterial strains [1]. It was first purified from Corynebacterium sp. U-96 and shown to be a heterotetrameric enzyme (Mr 174,000) [2]. The enzyme is composed of four nonidentical subunits (a, Mr 110,000; b, Mr 44,000; c, Mr 21,000; d, Mr 10,000) [2]. Since then, heterotetrameric SO has been purified from various sources: Corynebacterium sp. P-1 [3], Arthrobacter ureafaciens

[4], and Arthrobacter sp. 1-IN [5]. We have been studying SO from Corynebacterium sp. U-96 (SO-U96), and have characterized it [1,6­9]. To understand the structure­ function relationship of SO-U96 more in detail, we aimed to determine the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. This paper describes the crystal structure of SOU96. Based on the structure and on the previous works by us and others, the structure­function relationship on the heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase is discussed.

Materials and methods
Crystallization. Recombinant SO-U96 (recSO-U96) was expressed and purified as previously described [6], except that the chromato¨ graphic procedures were performed by AKTA prime system (Amersham Biosciences), using HiTrap DEAE FF, HisTrap HP, HiTrap Phenyl FF, Resources Q, and HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade columns (Amersham Biosciences). The recSO-U96 had the same enzymatic properties as the native one [6]. The homogeneity of the purified SO-U96 was confirmed by SDS­PAGE. The purified recSO-U96 in 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0) was concentrated to

approximately 5 mg/ml in an Amicon Ultra (Millipore) at 277 K. Crystallization was performed by vapor diffusion method. Preliminary screening of crystallization conditions was performed using Hampton Research Crystal Screen kits and Emerald Biostructure Screen kits at 293 K. Flower-like crystals were obtained by ammonium sulfate as a precipitant. Refinement of the crystallization conditions to 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.5), 1.9 M ammonium sulfate, and 10 mM CuSO4 improved the quality and size of the crystals. The crystals grew to approximate dimensions of 0.2 · 0.2 · 0.3 mm within a few weeks. The isomorphous heavy-atom derivative was prepared at 293 K by soaking the native crystal in crystallization buffers containing 0.1 mM HgSO4 for 1 day. The crystal of folinic acid (FON) complex was prepared by soaking the native crystal in the crystallization mother liquor containing 10 mM FON for 30 min at 293 K. Data collection, structure solution, and refinement. Diffraction data for HgSO4 derivative data sets and native data set were collected on NW12 in PF-AR using an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector, and FON complex data set was collected on BL5 in PF using an ADSC Quantum 315 CCD detector. A crystal of the protein was frozen using a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% (v/v) glycerol in the crystallization mother liquor. The data were processed using the MOSFLM [10] and scaled using the SCALA [11]. The crystal structure was solved using mercury derivative crystal and MAD method. The experimental phase was calculated to a resolution of ° 2.9 A with SOLVE [12] and density modification with RESOLVE [13]. The structure factor replacement for the native data and phase ° extension to 2.15 A resolution were carried out by DM [14]. Initial model building was carried out automatically by ARP/wARP [15], and additional model building was manually performed with O [16]. Refinement of the model was carried out using CNS [17]. Ten percent of the data set was selected for free R factor calculations. Water molecules were assigned automatically by ARP/wARP. The initial structure of FON complex was derived from the native model. The structure was refined with CNS, and manual modifications were made with O. A summary of the statistics for structural determination is given in Table 1.

Results and discussion Overall description The three-dimensional structure of recSO-U96 is shown in Fig. 1A. Overall dimension of the molecule ° ° ° is approximately 65 A · 85 A · 120 A. The missing residues (a 964; b 403, 404; c 1­5; d 91­98) have no electron density. The initiator Met has been removed in the a and b subunits of the native enzyme [20], but not in the d subunit [20,21]. As for c subunit, the N-terminal sequence (MANDT) has been removed [20,21]. The a subunit is composed of two large domains, the N-terminal half (nicotine domain, residue 1­565) and the C-terminal half (folate domain, residue 576­963). These two domains are linked with a 10 residue chain. The nicotine domain contains 1 mol NAD+, and the folate domain binds 1 mol folinic acid (FON) to a probable site of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-THF) synthesis. The b subunit contains flavin cofactors, 1 mol of noncovalent FAD and 1 mol of covalent FMN, and 1 mol of dimethylglycine. The flavin cofactors are ° approximately 10 A apart. The c subunit is along the linker between the nicotine and folate domains of the a subunit (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the c subunit and the part of folate domain are related by a noncrystallo-

graphic two-fold axis (Fig. 1B). The d subunit contains a single atom of zinc and has an unexpected structure, Cys3His zinc finger structure (Fig. 1A). To our knowledge, no zinc finger structure has been reported for oxidoreductases. The crystal structure shows a large spheroid-like cav° ° ° ° ity (15 A · 25 A · 30 A) with approximately 10,000 A3, containing 130 mol H2O and 1 mol ammonium sulfate. Fig. 1C shows a cross-section of the structure in Fig. 1A, implying to represent the structure of the large cavity with a surface inside the four subunits. The large cavity is accessible from the surface of the molecule through three channels. The channels are formed at the surface between the c subunit and N-terminal region of d sub-

unit, between the C-terminal region of d subunit and the FON-binding site of a subunit, and at the FONbinding site of a subunit. In the following, we discuss the structure­function relationship of the enzyme, based on the present crystal structure, relating with the previous works reported by our group and others. Sarcosine oxidase reaction The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of sarcosine to form glycine, formaldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide [1,2]. The site of the reaction is believed to be in the b subunit [1]. Two flavins are bound to b subunit, and

electrons flow from sarcosine to oxygen as: sarcosine fi FAD fi FMN fi oxygen. The binding of sarcosine to the FAD-binding site is the first event in the reaction. Therefore, the structure surrounding FAD is interesting. The electron density map shown in Fig. 2A resembled a dimethylglycine bound close to the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. The binding of dimethylglycine with recSO-U96 explains our previous observation on the recSO-U96. We observed the initial lag phase in the oxygen uptake in the oxidation of sarcosine by recSO-U96, but the lag disappeared by the preincubation of the enzyme with sarcosine under aerobic conditions (data not shown). The dimethylglycine is not a substrate of the enzyme [2], so the lag phase must be derived from the time needed to dissociate dimethylglycine from the site. Similar lag phase was reported for recSOP1 in the NADH peroxidase-coupled assay [24], and the lag was explained by assuming that the covalent FMN forms an adduct between a Cys residue and the 4a position of the isoalloxazine ring, and that the lag is attributed to the adduct dissociation [24]. But our SO-U96 structure did not support the proposal, since no Cys residue was observed around the covalent FMN (see Fig. 2C). The structure at the noncovalent FAD-binding site is similar to the active site of monomeric sarcosine oxidase (MSO) [25] (Fig. 2B). Chemical modification studies on SO-U96 showed that substrate analog, (sodium) acetate

prevents the modification of Lys358 by iodoacetamide (IAM) [8,9] and of His by diethylpyrocarbonate [26], suggesting the presence of Lys and His residues in the sarcosine-binding site [8,9,26]. The structure of the active site clearly supports these studies. That is, the amino acid residues surrounding dimethylglycine are Arg69, Lys358, Tyr271, and His269 (see Fig. 2B). This His residue is important in optimizing the orientation of the bound substrate in MSO [25], and protonated in dimethylglycine oxidase (DMGO) [27] from Tyr residue which acts as a nucleophile to the substrate. The N atom of dimethylglycine is in close contact with the C4a atom of FAD, and the methyl group is in close contact with the N5 atom [27]. Similarly, in recSO-U96, we assume that His269 and Tyr271 residues abstract N­H hydrogen from sarcosine, and FAD N5 atom from the methyl group of sarcosine. However, the distance from His269 to the N atom of dimethylglycine is approximately ° 11 A and is too long to reach (see Fig. 2B). Moreover, the C-terminal chain (399­402) of b subunit occupies a site of these residues (Fig. 2B). It is therefore likely that additional rearrangements take place to accommodate sarcosine molecule in the active site. Questions of the substrate location and of the mechanism and the pathway of hydrogen transfer will have to await crystallographic studies on the dimethylglycine-free recSO-U96. The next step in the sarcosine oxidase reaction is the hydrogen transfer from the reduced FAD to the oxi-

dized FMN. Our stopped-flow kinetic studies suggest that the transfer is rapid [7], indicating a good channel of hydrogen (probably, proton and electron) between these cofactors. The distance from the flavin N5 of FAD to that of FMN is estimated to be approximately ° 10 A. So, the direct transfer of hydrogen must not be possible. How they are transferred from FAD to FMN? Between these cofactors, there are hydrogenbonding networks comprised of the structured H2O, Thr65, Ser273, and Glu279 (Fig. 2C). We predict that the networks facilitate the transfer of electron and proton. The proton may be transferred by proton-jumping. On possible pathway will be: FAD fi Thr65 fi H2O fi Ser273 fi H2O fi Glu279 fi FMN. The binding of flavin C8a-methyl group to Ne2 of His172 [9,28] is confirmed as shown in Fig. 2C. More-

over, the relatively large space around the e amino group of Lys171 is suggested, since 2 mol of IAM reacts with Lys171 [9]. This is confirmed by the structure shown in Fig. 2C. The last step in the sarcosine oxidase reaction is the reaction of the reduced FMN with oxygen. As Fig. 2D shows, the isoalloxazine ring of the covalent FMN is opened to the surface of the enzyme protein, so oxygen can freely reach the reduced FMN, and H2O2 produced easily exits from the site. 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate-forming reaction SO from Corynebacterium sp. P-1(SO-P1) binds folates and catalyzes the formation of 5,10-CH2-THF [29­32]. It was proposed that the C-terminal domain

of the a subunit is the active site of the reaction [31,32]. As for SO-U96, the 5,10-CH2-THF-forming reaction has not been studied, but the C-terminal half (515 residues long) of the a subunit of SO-U96 [6] is in 90.5% identity with the corresponding region of SO-P1 [31]. So, we discuss on the structure of SO-U96 assuming that SO-U96 catalyzes the 5,10-CH2-THF-forming reaction. As SO-P1 binds folates [29,30], so we soaked the recSO-U96 crystal with FON to get the X-ray diffraction data. FON was selected, since the compound is stable under neutral and alkaline conditions [33]. As Fig. 1 shows, 1 mol of FON is bound to the a subunit, and the c subunit has a structure quite similar to the FONbinding site of a subunit (Fig. 1B). It is therefore possible that c subunit binds folates. This is confirmed by the observation that SO-P1 binds 2 mol of THF and that FON binds weakly with SO-P1 as compared with THF [29]. The binding site of FON is assumed to be the active site of the 5,10-CH2-THF-forming reaction. The FONbinding site is located at the folate domain of a subunit (Figs. 1B and 3). Moreover, the pteridine ring faces the large cavity and the glutamate residue is located on the surface of the domain (Fig. 1C). Therefore, THF and 5,10-CH2-THF are freely bound to the active site of the 5,10-CH2-THF-forming reaction. The NAD+-binding site and zinc finger structures Fig. 4 shows the NAD+-binding site of the enzyme. The nicotine ring is stacked with the hydrophobic residues (Phe380 and Leu422). But many water molecules are surrounding these residues (Fig. 4). So, unlike usual NAD+-dependent enzymes, the NAD+ binds strongly to the a subunit like a prosthetic group, rather than being a substrate-like cofactor. The strong binding of NAD+ is supported by the observation that recSO-U96 is prepared as the NAD+-bound form and that the bound NAD is released by the acid treatment [6]. The role of the bound NAD+ is not clarified at present, even though the amino acid residues interacting with the NAD+ are known. One of the Cys residues in the d subunit was assumed to form a 4a-adduct of the covalent FMN [24,32]. But, the overall structure clearly shows that all the Cys residues in d subunit form zinc finger structure (Fig. 5). By our knowledge, no paper has been published on oxidoreductases having a zinc finger structure, and previous works on heterotetrameric SOs did not give us any indication of the presence of zinc finger structure. A large cavity ``A large cavity'' in oxidoreductases is reported for bacterial alcohol dehydrogenase [34], DMGO [27], and pyranose 2-oxidase [35]. The volume of cavity is

° reported to be >5000 A3 [27] and approximately ° 15,000 A3 [35]. The cavity of DMGO has a channel to the outside of the protein and a role that the cavity enables sequestration of the reactive intermediate prior to reaction with THF and avoid formation of toxic formaldehyde produced by the enzyme action [27]. It is uncertain at present if a role similar to the cavity of DMGO is applicable to that of SO-U96. As Fig. 1C shows, recSOU96 has three channels leading from the surface into the cavity. We assume that through the channels substrates (sarcosine, THF) must enter the cavity, and products (HCHO, glycine, and 5,10-CH2-THF) must exit from the cavity. In the three channels, we predict that the channel at the FON-binding site is the pathway of THF and 5,10-CH2-THF, since the narrow channel is well fitted to the folates (Fig. 1C).

Concluding remarks The three-dimensional structure of heterotetrameric SO from Corynebacterium sp. U-96 has opened the complex structure of the flavoenzyme. As for the oxidase reaction, a possible hydrogen transfer pathway from sarcosine to oxygen is presented, but how substrate sarcosine interacts with the amino acid residues in the active site awaits further crystallographic study of the enzyme. An unexpected structure, zinc finger structure was found in the d subunit. The finding of the structure opens up a

new aspect of the flavoenzymes. The nicotine-binding site is located in the a subunit, but the role of bound NAD+ is not known. One folate-binding site is located in the a subunit, and a probable folate-binding structure is found in the c subunit. A large cavity is found in the molecule, but further analysis of the structural data is required to clarify the role of the large cavity.
