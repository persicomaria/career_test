Trimeric calf spleen purine nucleoside phosphorylase has been complexed with hypoxanthine via phosphorolysis of inosine in the presence of phosphate. The resulting ``Michaelis'' complex (three hypoxanthine molecules per trimer), presumed to be formed under these conditions, crystallized in the cubic space group P21 3, with unit cell dimension a = 94.11 Å and one monomer in the asymmetric crystal unit; the biologically active trimer is located on the crystallographic 3-fold axis. High-resolution X-ray diffraction data were collected using synchrotron radiation (EMBL outstation, Hamburg, c/o DESY). The crystal structure has been determined by molecular replacement and refined at 2.15 Å resolution to an R-value of 0.18. In the hypoxanthine binding site, a cis-peptide bond between Asn243 and Lys244 is observed. Side-chains of Glu201 and Asn243, as well as one integral water molecule located in the base binding site, form hydrogen bonds with the hypoxanthine N-1 H, N-7 H and O-6. A second water molecule links the base positions N-3 and N-9 with an adjacent pocket, which presumably is the phosphate-binding site. This pocket is filled completely by a cluster of six water molecules. Hence all possible donor/acceptor-positions of hypoxanthine are saturated by hydrogenbonding to protein side-chains or integral water molecules. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase isolated form human tissues is a primary target for chemotherapeutic intervention, and the more stable calf enzyme has similar physico-chemical and kinetic properties, as well as response to inhibitors. Hence the high-resolution structure presented here may serve for design of inhibitors with potential pharmacological applications.

Introduction
Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP, purine nucleoside: orthophosphate ribosyl transferase EC 2.4.2.1) catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of ribo- and 2'-deoxyribonucleosides of guanine and hypoxanthine in higher organisms, as well as those

of adenine in some prokaryotes (e.g. in Escherichia coli ), as follows: b-nucleoside + Pi _ base + a-D-pentose 1-phosphate Although the reaction equilibrium favors nucleoside synthesis, the enzyme in vivo normally operates in the phosphorolytic (degradative) direction because of the rapid metabolic removal of the cleavage products (Stoeckler, 1984). PNP has a very high substrate turnover in human tissues, especially in lymphocytes and erythrocytes (Parks et al., 1975; Van der Weyden & Bailey, 1982). The whole-body activity of erythrocytic PNP can cleave

203 Furthermore, although there is no report that mammalian PNPs are metal-dependent enzymes, it has been shown that the presence of Zn2+ results in a marked decrease of the apparent inhibition constant of the best reported bisubstrate analog inhibitor (Kelley et al., 1995). The threedimensional crystal structure could be useful in clarifying the existence of possible metal-binding sites of PNP. The mechanism of phosphorolysis catalyzed by mammalian PNPs is still not adequately characterized, but some proposals (Kline & Schramm, 1993; Bzowska et al., 1993) point to enzymatic preprotonation of N-7 of the nucleoside, a mechanism similar to non-enzymatic acid hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond (Zoltewicz et al., 1970). Furthermore, it has been shown that, in the absence of phosphate, calf PNP catalyzes (with a very low turn-over) the hydrolysis of inosine to give a tight-binding ``conformation'' complex of the enzyme with one hypoxanthine molecule per trimer (Kline & Schramm, 1992). Comparison of the three-dimensional structure of such a complex with that described below should be helpful in attempts to clarify the reaction mechanism. The crystal structure of human erythrocyte PNP ° has been reported to a resolution of 2.75 A (Ealick et al., 1990a,b, 1991; Brookhaven PDB entries 1ULA and 1ULB). The crystals were grown from ammonium sulfate at pH 5.5, conditions where the enzyme activity is significantly decreased (Agarwal & Parks, 1969), and the phosphate binding site is fully occupied by a sulfate ion, hampering studies with bisubstrate analog inhibitors that interact with the phosphate binding site. Furthermore the human enzyme is also inherently unstable (Bzowska et al., 1991) and is a mixture of several isoelectric variants (Edwards et al., 1971; Zannis et al., 1978), which may partially account for the limited quality of the crystals obtained. These circumstances directed our attention to the calf spleen enzyme, which is stable in solution, does not exhibit isoelectric variants, while its physicochemical and kinetic properties, as well as response to inhibitors, differ only minimally from those of the human enzyme (Agarwal et al., 1975; Stoeckler et al., 1978a; Bzowska et al., 1990, 1991, 1994). Its sequence of 284 amino acid residues (Bzowska et al., 1995), however, with a monomeric molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa, differs somewhat from that of the human enzyme, lending added interest to comparison of its structure with that of human PNP. Like most other PNPs of mammalian origin (Stoeckler, 1984), the calf spleen enzyme appears to exist as a trimer in solution (Stoeckler et al., 1978a). The postulated existence of enzymatically active monomers in solution has been reported (Ropp & Traut, 1991), but we have been unable to reproduce these findings. We report here the three-dimensional structure of the calf phosphorylase in a ``Michaelis'' complex (Kline & Schramm, 1992) with three hypoxanthine ° molecules per trimer at 2.15 A resolution.

more than 10 g of inosine per minute (Stoeckler et al., 1986a). PNP has been a primary target for chemotherapeutic intervention since Giblett et al. (1975) reported that a child suffering from lymphopenia and exhibiting severe deficiency of cellular immunity but normal B-cell function, completely lacked PNP activity. The symptoms of PNP-deficiency suggest several chemotherapeutic applications for potent inhibitors of this enzyme. They may serve as selective immunosuppressive agents to suppress the host versus graft response in organ transplantations, to treat T-cell leukemias, and to counter T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis (Stoeckler et al., 1980a; Kazmers et al., 1981; Stoeckler, 1984). PNP inhibitors are also promising as co-drugs in therapy with purine nucleoside analog (e.g. dideoxyinosine with anti-HIV activity), which are readily cleaved intracellularly by PNP before reaching the target cells (Stoeckler et al., 1980b). Because of the high level of activity of PNP in humans, biologically active inhibitors that would be able to simulate PNP deficiency in vivo should have inhibition constants at least in the nanomolar range. Despite the strong interest in developing potent PNP inhibitors (Parks et al., 1981; Kazmers et al., 1981; Stoeckler et al., 1986a,b; Shewach et al., 1986; Stein et al., 1987; Sircar et al., 1987, 1992; Gilbertsen et al., 1991; Bzowska et al., 1991; Halazy et al., 1991; Secrist et al., 1993), a clinically useful agent is not yet available, although some analogs with inhibition constants as low as several nM have been identified (e.g. see Tuttle & Krenitsky, 1984; Erion et al., 1993; Montgomery et al., 1993; Kelley et al., 1995). The most potent candidates are bisubstrate analog inhibitors that bind to both nucleoside and orthophosphate binding sites, but carry negative charges that preclude efficient transport through the cell membrane. This is illustrated by the fact that the most potent reported inhibitor (Kelley et al., 1995) with Ki = 3 nM at 1 mM phosphate, exhibits only weak activity against human leukemic T-cells in vitro. Since bisubstrate analog inhibitors interact with the phosphate-binding site, measured Ki values are, in fact, apparent values and depend strongly on phosphate concentration, being frequently much lower in 1 mM than in 50 mM phosphate (typical assay conditions for non-saturation and saturation of PNP with orthophosphate, respectively). The extracellular phosphate concentration is 2 mM, whereas the intracellular concentration is in the range 1 mM to 5 mM, depending on cell type (Murray et al., 1990, Traut, 1994). Since the Michaelis constant, Km , for orthophosphate is 00.9 to 3 mM for the human erythrocyte PNP (Bzowska et al., 1990; Ropp & Traut, 1991), analogs with low Ki at 1 mM phosphate may not be sufficiently potent for simulating PNP deficiency in vivo, since even small changes in phosphate concentration may change the Ki significantly, depending on the cell type (Traut, 1994).

Results and Discussion
Overall structure of the PNP monomer The overall structure of the refined model is shown in Figure 1. The secondary structural elements (helices and b-sheets) are listed in Table 1 with their residue numbers. The core of the enzyme is formed by an extended b-sheet arrangement. After Hutchinson & Thornton (1996), it is characterized as a nine-stranded mixed b-barrel. It is surrounded by nine a-helices and two short 310-helices. These elements are connected by extended loops, a characteristic feature of the PNP molecule. The longest loops are between 310-helix H2 and b-strand S3 (15 residues, partly disordered or flexible), between H6 and H7 (27 residues, running like a belt from one side of the monomer to another at the surface of the molecule, Figure 1 in red) and between b-strand S9 and helix H10 (20 residues, partly disordered or flexible). The hypoxanthine molecule, one integral water molecule in the base binding site, and six water molecules filling the presumed phosphate binding site, are indicated in black (Figure 1). The features of the active center are discussed below. As regards the fine details of the secondary structure, only a few need to be mentioned. The loop connecting S8 and H9 contains a g-turn (Ser220-Val222), which forms part of the phosphate binding motif (see below). In this very tight turn the backbone conformation of Thr221 is sterically strained, as indicated by unfavourable f/c-angles (-47°/-50°) in the Ramachandran plot (not shown). In solution, calf spleen PNP, like PNP from other mammalian sources, exists as a trimer, which is the enzymatically active form (Stoeckler et al., 1978a; Stoeckler, 1984). In the crystal structure, the identical monomers in the trimer are related by a 3-fold crystallographic axis, as for human PNP (Ealick et al., 1990b). The contacts between trimers, however, are completely different in the calf (cubic space group P21 3) and human (rhombohedral space group R32) PNP structures. In calf spleen PNP, the packing is tight, with a water content of about 45% as compared to 80% in the R32 structure (estimated as described by Matthews, 1968). This may be one of the reasons for the substantially better diffracting power of calf spleen PNP crystals. In the R32 structure, pairs of trimers form loosely bound hexamers, whereas in the present study no hexamers are observed (Figure 2). Although the solvent content of the calf spleen PNP crystals is relatively low, there are only few direct protein-protein contacts between trimers (four hydrogen-bonding contacts listed in Table 2). Most of the interactions between trimers are mediated by water molecules: protein-water-protein (Table 2). In addition to the direct protein-protein and water-bridged contacts, the trimers are linked by two cations, one of which is probably Mg2+. As noted above, Mg2+ was found to be necessary for crystallization of calf spleen PNP. The cation is surrounded by six water molecules with

The trimers, which are present in solution, are indicated by triangles.

° cation · · · water distances of 2.06 to 2.29 A (Table 3) in almost ideal octahedral geometry. This octahedron of water molecules links two trimers via contacts to residues 44 to 46 (b-strand S2) of one molecule and residues 50 to 56 (helix H2 and adjacent b-turn) of a neighboring monomer of the other trimer (Figure 3, Table 3). Since Mg2+ itself has no direct contact to the protein, it is the metal ion together with its complete hydration shell that connects the trimers in the crystal packing arrangement. Adjacent to the Mg2+-site, the electron density for eight amino acid residues (59 to 66, part of the long loop between helix H2 and b-strand S3)

is only weak or missing. This is apparently a disordered or flexible part of a loop extending into a solvent channel neighboring the Mg2+-site. In the crystal structure of human erythrocyte PNP, this part of the molecule is involved in crystal packing contacts and is therefore not disordered. The second metal-binding site, situated on a 3-fold axis connecting trimers in the crystal lattice, shows the highest positive peak of about 27 × r.m.s in the difference electron density map. This high electron density is indicative of a heavy atom, and excludes Mg2+. Since there is no heavy atom or transition metal salt in the crystallization protocol,

we assume that this is due to a contaminant in one of the chemicals used in the preparation and/or crystallization of PNP. This is not a unique observation, since the same site has been observed in all isomorphous crystal structures of calf PNP with several different inhibitors (unpublished results). Attempts to characterize this metal ion by atomic spectroscopy gave no unambiguous results. No transition metal was found in chemicals used for crystallization, i.e. PEG 4000, MgCl2 or Tris from Merck company. It was not possible to analyze the content of transition metal in the crystal, since crystals of calf spleen cannot be dissolved in water or low-salt solution, conditions necessary for typical atomic absorption spectroscopy. Further attempts to identify this metal ion should probably employ solid-state atomic analysis. Considering the height of the difference peak, this atomic site could be occupied by an ion with a molecular mass similar to that of Ni2+ or Zn2+. Although there is no experimental evidence that mammalian PNPs are metal-dependent enzymes, Kelley et al. (1995) reported that the presence of

Zn2+ markedly enhanced the inhibitory potency of their best bisubstrate analog inhibitor with human erythrocyte PNP; the mechanism was not elucidated. The possible Zn2+ binding position observed ° in this study is located 14 A from the active site and the potential role of this cation-binding site, either in binding of some inhibitors, or simply in crystal packing, requires further investigation. As shown in Figure 4, this unidentified cation is surrounded roughly tetrahedrally by three symmetry-related histidine residues (His20 Ne, dist. ° ° 2.2 A) and one water molecule Wat433 (dist. 2.76 A, angle 104°). A second water site, Wat432, is located ° at a distance of 3.15 A; if it is also regarded as a near-neighbor contact, this would result in a trigonal bipyramidal surrounding of the metal ion. Since these water and metal ion sites are situated on a 3-fold axis, and present refinement programs (XPLOR and TNT) cannot handle such special positions satisfactorily, these positions (distances and angles) are less reliable than the rest of the structure, and some uncertainty concerning the geometry of this metal-binding site remains.

The location of the unidentified metal cation (see also Figures 2 and 4) is shown as a circle with enlarged van der Waals radius in each monomer. Direct contacts between monomers forming the trimer are mainly from the loop between residues 141 and 168 of one monomer, which is the longest loop belting the monomer from one side (in red, see also Table 4). Drawn with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).

Figure 2 exhibits the arrangement of the PNP trimers in the unit cell. The site of the unidentified metal ion on the 3-fold axis is shown as a small sphere, and metal-protein contacts as broken lines. Structure of the trimer The present study reveals that calf spleen PNP exists as a trimer of three identical monomers, the arrangement of which is shown in Figure 5. The possible hydrogen-bonding interactions between PNP monomers forming the trimer via 3-fold crystallographic symmetry are given in Table 4. The majority of close contacts between monomers consists of the loop 142-167 of one monomer, which is the longest loop observed belting the molecule from one side (see Figure 1, in red) and different regions of the second monomer. The cis-proline 198 is adjacent to the contacts forming the trimer. These direct contacts are accompanied by water-mediated interactions (Table 4). Close to the active site is a region where there are only protein-water-protein contacts: from region 248 to 257 of the partially disordered or flexible loop to residues Asp143, Phe159 and Ser163 located in the longest loops belting the monomer from one side. The three active sites of the trimeric enzyme are occupied by one hypoxanthine (Hx) molecule each. This is in line with kinetic data for possible PNP-Hx complexes. In solution, a ``Michaelis'' complex is formed from inosine in the presence of phosphate (i.e. three hypoxanthine molecules are complexed

per protein trimer), whereas in the absence of phosphate a tight-binding complex (one hypoxanthine molecule per trimer) is formed (Kline & Schramm, 1992). The complex presented here was obtained with a large excess of phosphate, hence formation of the Michaelis complex must be expected. Mean temperature factors for the protein ° and the base are similar (28.3 and 23.3 A2, respectively), indicating that the hypoxanthine site is fully occupied. The phosphate molecule is not observed in the calf spleen PNP structure (see Materials and Methods and below). Base binding site Possible hydrogen bonds between calf spleen PNP and hypoxanthine are given in Table 5 and Figure 6. In addition, there are two water molecules (Wat302 and Wat342) forming possible hydrogen bonds with hypoxanthine. Because of the cis conformation of the peptide bond between Asn243 and Lys244 (see above), the Lys244 side-chain is directed away from the active site, possibly forming an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly119. Cis-peptide conformations are rather rarely described in protein structures and, if they occur, they are almost invariably found in regions involved in the function of the protein (Herzberg & Moult, 1991). Although no direct hydrogen bond contact is observed between the hypoxanthine and the cis-peptide bond Asn243-Lys244 of the active site, we presume that

this strained conformation plays a role in enzyme catalysis. The architecture of the base binding site clearly explains the high affinity of hypoxanthine for calf PNP (Ki = 2.5 mM, Kulikowska et al., 1986). O-6 of hypoxanthine forms two hydrogen bonds with Asn243Nd and the integral water molecule Wat302 present in the base binding site. All four base nitrogen atoms are involved in hydrogen bonding with either protein (N-1 H to Glu201 Oe and N-7 H to Asn243 Od ) or Wat342, located between the base and the presumed phosphate binding site (N-3 and N-9). The N-7 H tautomer of the base appears to be the preferred ligand of calf spleen PNP, in line with the lower affinity of nucleosides (e.g. inosine, guanosine) in comparison to the corresponding bases (Krenitsky, 1967; Krenitsky et al., 1968; Stoeckler, 1984; Kulikowska et al., 1986), since the

N-7/N-9-tautomeric equilibrium is excluded for nucleosides. The reason for the low affinity of 7-methylated bases (Bzowska et al., 1988), e.g. 7-methylhypoxanthine and 7-methylguanine (Ki e 1.5 mM and 0.4 mM, respectively) can be explained as follows: the methyl group prevents formation of the N-7-Asn243 Od hydrogen bond, but the Asn243 side-chain is probably sterically displaced, which will affect the second hydrogen bond formed by O-6 and Asn243 Nd. The foregoing is in line with kinetic data for human PNP (Krenitsky et al., 1968). Methylation of N-7 increases the inhibition constant of hypoxanthine from 10 mM to 3.9 mM. Methylation of N-9, N-3 and N-1 has a similar effect, the respective inhibition constants being 1.4 mM and 2.5 mM for 3-methyl- and 1-methylhypoxanthine, and 6.7 mM

Figure 6. Mode of binding of hypoxanthine in the active site of calf spleen PNP. Possible hydrogen bonds are indicated by broken lines (oxygen atoms are blue, nitrogen atoms pink). N-7 and N-1 of hypoxanthine probably donate hydrogen bonds to Asn243 Od and Glu201 Oe, respectively, while N3, N-9 and O-6 are acceptors. In addition, there are base-protein hydrophobic interactions with Ala117 C, Ca; Gly118 Ca; Phe200 Cd, Ce (shown schematically); and Glu201 Cd. One integral water molecule, Wat302, in the base binding site, and the network of six water molecules in the presumed phosphate binding site, as shown, should be taken into account in considering design and location of potential inhibitors. The positions of four of these water molecules (blue, dotted) are occupied by atoms of the acyclic chain of N-7-acycloguanosine inhibitor in a previously determined complex with calf spleen PNP (Bzowska et al., 1995). Drawn with SCHAKAL (Keller, 1988).

for 1,9-dimethylhypoxanthine. Such methylation prevents formation of hydrogen bonds with either the protein or water molecules Wat302 and Wat342. Water 342 appears to occupy a key position, since it links the base and presumed phosphate binding sites, and forms two hydrogen bonds with N-3 and N-9 of hypoxanthine, one with the main-chain

Met219 N and two additional hydrogen bonds with other water molecules (Wat389 and Wat328), which occupy the presumed phosphate binding site (see below). The inhibition constants (Krenitsky et al., 1968) for 6-methoxypurine and hypoxanthine (6-oxopurine) differ by a factor of 6 (Ki 60 mM and 10 mM

Trimer surface C terminus

Trimmer surface, surface of the trimer formed by PNP monomers. Trimer contact, contacts between monomers forming the trimer. All other substitutions do not lead to structural changes and are located on the trimer surface (11K : Q, 12N : D, 15E : K, 23H : Q, 47I : T, 72F : I, 93L : F, 104H : R, 109D : E, 123K : N, 152D : E, 157D : V, 169T : D, 173R : K, 175L : H, 208V : L, 262A : E, 277I : L), on trimer contacts (210Q : R, 211K : N), on the trimer axis (144Q : E) and only one in the protein core (29I : V).

for the human enzyme, respectively), presumably because the methyl group is located at the site of Wat302, thus preventing formation of a hydrogen bond between Wat302 and the side-chain of Glu201. An alternative binding geometry, with the methyl group located in the position of the side-chain of Asn243, would result in deletion of two hydrogen bonds between Asn243 side-chain and the base, and reduce the binding constant. This should increase the inhibition constant by at least two orders of magnitude, as observed for other methylated hypoxanthines (Kretnisky et al., 1968), and points to Wat302 as an integral water molecule with an important role in the protein structure. In addition to the hydrogen-bond network, three van der Waals contacts between the base and the protein are observed (see Figure 6). Ala117 and Gly118, as well as side-chain atoms of Phe200 (Cd1, Ce1 and Ce2 of the phenyl ring) are involved in van ° der Waals interactions ranging from 3.51 to 3.87 A. These atoms are located ``above'' the plane of the hypoxanthine ring, and the phenyl ring of Phe200 is oriented perpendicular to the base-plane. Phosphate binding site Prior to crystallization, calf spleen PNP was released from the affinity column with inosine and phosphate. However, probably due to the weak affinity of the latter for the calf enzyme (KM = 0.86 mM, Bzowska et al., 1990; Km 0 3 mM, Ropp & Traut, 1991), no phosphate is observed in the crystal structure. This is in line with additional kinetic data, since no ternary complex enzymebase-Pi was observed in solution for mammalian PNPs. Such ternary complex would represent a dead-end reaction, since the second substrate in the synthesis of purine nucleosides catalyzed by PNP is a-D-pentose 1-phosphate (see reaction scheme, Introduction, and next section). The active site of PNP is a well-defined pocket, and the presumed

phosphate binding site is occupied by water molecules. Next to the base binding site a network of six water molecules fills the pocket completely, pointing to ordered defined water sites, see Table 5 and Figure 6. As previously reported (Bzowska et al, 1995) the inhibitor N-7-acycloguanosine, with the acyclic chain attached to N-7 of the base, binds in an inverted orientation with respect to hypoxanthine. The acyclic chain -CH2-CH2-NH2+ -CH(CH2 OH)2 , located in the region probably occupied normally by the ribose and phosphate, is engaged in several hydrogen bonds with protein side-chains through the primary hydroxyl groups and the quaternary nitrogen atom. Comparison of these two structures shows that the first carbon atom (C-10) of the acyclic chain of N-7-acycloguanosine, the nitrogen atom of the acyclic chain and the two terminal hydroxyl groups occupy the same positions as Wat342, Wat328 and water molecules Wat418 and Wat324, respectively. These four water positions are marked in Figure 6. Note in particular, that Wat342 is located in the presumed reaction center of PNP, i.e. close to the probable position of C-1' of the ribose (see also the next section). Comparison of the calf spleen PNP-hypoxanthine complex with the human erythrocyte PNP-guanine complex (PDB entry code 1ULB) The amino acid sequence of calf spleen PNP differs from that of human erythrocyte PNP in that its C terminus is truncated by five residues, and 32 residues are replaced by other amino acid types (Bzowska et al., 1995). The majority of these are located either on the trimer surface or in the region involved in contacts between monomers forming the trimer. Most of the replacements are conservative so that the electrostatic features of the residues are maintained (see Table 6 for an overview of changes). The overall structure of the calf spleen

Crystal Structure of Calf Spleen PNP

211 The complexes, i.e. human PNP-Gua (PDB entry 1ULB) and calf spleen PNP-Hx, were determined at different resolution levels, therefore location of the integral water molecules can be considered more reliable for calf spleen PNP. This may be one reason for the observed differences in the base binding site. The second may be that the human PNP-Gua complex is in fact a ternary complex with sulfate occupying the phosphate-binding site. Such a complex shows probably a dead-end reaction, since the second substrate in the synthetic reaction is a-D-pentose 1-phosphate, but not phosphate (see reaction scheme, Introduction). It is not clear whether such a ternary complex enzyme-Hx-sulfate exists in solution or whether it is formed only because of the high sulfate concentration used for crystallization (up to 3 M ammonium sulfate, Ealick et al., 1990b). Furthermore, it should be pointed out that hypoxanthine, but not guanine is able to form a tight-binding ``conformation'' complex with the calf spleen PNP (Kline & Schramm, 1992), suggesting that these two bases, although very similar, do not necessarily interact with the enzyme in a similar mode. Consequently, the observed differences may reflect real changes in the base binding site and may not be attributed to resolution, crystallization conditions or enzyme source. Finally, it should be stressed that the crystallization conditions used in the present study are of physiological relevance, since the pH is close to the reaction optimum for PNP (Agarwal & Parks, 1969; Kulikowska et al., 1986) and no precipitating agent interacts with the enzyme active site. These crystallization conditions may be employed for further experimental studies of the PNP enzymatic mechanism and bisubstrate analog inhibitors that interact with the phosphate binding site. Since calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNPs show similar inhibition patterns, the calf spleen PNP model should be useful in drug design.

PNP is extremely similar to that of the human enzyme. Although none of the changes in the sequence is located in the active center, one interesting difference, relative to human PNP is the mode of binding of the base. Whereas in human PNP there is a direct contact between Lys244 Nz and the guanine O-6, the atomic position of Lys244 Nz in the human PNP is occupied by a water molecule ° (Wat302), bridging hypoxanthine O-6 (dist. 2.96 A) in calf spleen PNP. This is a consequence of the cis-peptide bond Asn243-Lys244. In the human PNP-guanine complex, the peptide bond between Asn243 and Lys244 is in the trans-conformation, but both torsion angles of the backbone are found in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Asn243 f/c 174/-126°; Lys244 f/c 84/148°). We assume that this observed structural difference between the human PNP-guanine (Gua) complex and the calf PNP-hypoxanthine complex may be due to the much higher crystallographic resolution of the latter. A further difference is found in the relative position of the phenyl ring of Phe200 with respect to the purine plane. In the calf spleen PNP-Hx complex, the side-chain of Phe200 is rotated by 90° with respect to the human PNP-Gua complex, so that aromatic stacking is no longer observed. Since the human PNP-Gua complex was crystallized with ammonium sulfate as precipitating agent, the phosphate binding site is occupied by sulfate. In the calf spleen PNP-Hx complex, the position of this ion is occupied by water molecules 324, 328 and 418. All the resulting hydrogen bonds with the protein are conserved, involving Ser33 N, Arg84 Nh, Ala116 N and Ser220 Og (see Table 5 for complete contacts of the water network). In the human PNP structure a second sulfate binding site was found in the region of the loop formed by residues 32 to 42 (between b-strands S1 and S2). It is not clear whether this second binding site is observed due to the high excess of sulfate used as precipitating agent and whether it binds sulfate also in solution. Kinetic data for calf PNP suggest that there is a second phosphate binding site that may play a regulatory role (Ropp & Traut, 1991). The loop where the second sulfate binding site is observed in the human PNP-Gua complex is not well defined in the calf spleen PNP crystal structure, because it is located in a wide solvent channel. Hence no equivalent to the second sulfate binding site can be described in the present study. The trimer of calf spleen PNP is similar to that of human PNP, but there are some additional possible hydrogen-bond interactions between monomers forming the trimer (see Table 4 for comparison). One major conformational change is observed in the region 195 to 200. In human PNP this segment is a random loop, while in calf spleen PNP sequence changes at positions 195, 196 and 199, and the cis-conformation of Pro198 permit formation of a b-turn (197G-200F, type IV; Hutchinson & Thornton, 1996).

Materials and Methods
Purification Calf spleen purine nucleoside phosphorylase (Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis MO, USA), with specific activity of 16 to 21 units/mg, exhibits a single band on SDS-PAGE with silver staining, indicating an enzyme purity of e99%. Unfortunately, only poor-quality crystals could be grown from this material. Therefore the protein was further purified by affinity chromatography as described for human erythrocyte PNP by Osborne (1980). The affinity gel consisted of the weak PNP inhibitor 6-hydroxy-9-p-aminobenzylpurine coupled to Sepharose CL-6B via trichloro-s-triazine (Osborne, 1980). All operations were performed at 4°C. The enzyme was removed from the affinity column by an excess of substrates: 4 mM inosine and 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol. During elution, phosphorolysis is active and produces hypoxanthine and ribose 1-phosphate. The active fractions were washed several times with 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.9) containing 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol on 30 kDa cut-off Amicon membrane filters. Affinity of hypoxan-

thine (Ki = 2.5 mM; Kulikowska et al., 1986) is very high in comparison to both phosphate (Km = 0.86 mM; Bzowska et al., 1990) and ribose 1-phosphate (Km = 0.5 mM; Krenitsky, 1967), so that the PNP-hypoxanthine binary complex is formed in this procedure. In the final washing cycle, the enzyme was concentrated to between 10 and 12 mg/ml, with specific activity of 34 units/mg. Gel electrophoresis (Phast system, Pharmacia) exhibited a single band (silver staining), and gel filtration (FPLC, Superose 12 Hr 10/20 column, Pharmacia) showed one symmetrical peak. Protein concentration was measured spectrophotomet280 rically in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) with E1% = 9.6, similar to that for human erythrocyte PNP (Stoeckler et al., 1978a,b). Enzyme activity was determined as described (Bzowska et al., 1995). Crystallization The PNP-hypoxanthine complex was crystallized at 18°C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method (24-well tissue culture Linbro plates). The 4 ml drops, consisting of 2 ml of 10 to 12 mg/ml PNP-hypoxanthine complex in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.9) containing 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol and 2 ml of reservoir solution, were equilibrated against 0.7 ml of reservoir containing 11 to 16% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.04 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.2 to 8.5) and 0.08 M MgCl2 . Dome-shaped crystals with dimensions up to 0.3 mm appeared after two weeks. The presence of magnesium ions is apparently essential for crystallization under these conditions. Calf spleen PNP could be crystallized at pH 5.2 to 5.6 (0.05 M citrate buffer) from PEG 4000 or ammonium sulfate. These conditions (with ammonium sulfate as precipitant) were previously used to obtain X-ray suitable crystals of human erythrocyte PNP (Cook et al., 1981). However, crystals of calf spleen PNP obtained at

this pH appeared as aggregates of thin plates, unsuitable for X-ray diffraction studies. X-ray data collection The PNP-hypoxanthine complex crystallizes in the cubic space group P21 3 with unit cell dimension ° ° a = 94.11 A (V = 833,500 A3 ), Z = 12, with one monomer in the asymmetric crystal unit. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 4°C with monochromatic synchrotron ° radiation (l = 0.9204 A) using a Mar Research Image Plate detector at the EMBL Outstation at DESY (Hamburg) on beamline X31, 21 frames of 1.2° oscillation. Data were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Minor, 1993; Otwinowski, 1993). Measured intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes using the program TRUNCATE incorporated in the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). Intensity data statistics are given in Table 7. Structure solution and refinement The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (Navazza, 1994) incorporated in the CCP4 program package (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). Atomic coordinates of the model structures of human PNP (Ealick et al., 1990b) were of the following quality: Brookhaven PDB code 1ULB (space group R32 with one monomer per ° asymmetric unit), R-factor 0.18 for data up to 2.75 A, ° r.m.s. deviations from the ideal bond lengths 0.019 A and from the ideal bond angles 3.0°. A rotation search for the monomer of PNP in the space group P21 3 gave no interpretable results. Hence the rotation search was undertaken with a trimer model of human PNP, generated by applying the 3-fold symmetry of space group R32 to human PNP monomer coordinates.

were extended to the corresponding isomorphous ° subgroup P21 21 21 (resolution range 9 to 5 A). Cross-rotation calculation showed one prominent maximum (correlation coefficient 13.0, approximately 1.5 times that of the next highest maximum). This orientation was used to calculate the translation function for the monomer in ° the correct space group P21 3 (resolution range 8 to 4 A, correlation coefficient 43.8). Rigid body refinement resulted in an R-value of 46%. In several refinement cycles, using the TNT program package (Tronrud et al., 1987), the amino acid sequence of calf spleen PNP (Bzowska et al., 1995) was fitted to the electron density. Model building was done at an ESV-workstation using the graphical program FRODO (Jones, 1978); electron density maps (>Fo = - =Fc > and

>Fo = - =Fc > were calculated with CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994): 131 water sites with good hydrogen-bonding geometry were included in the model. For several atoms in side-chains, the electron density was weak: Asn40 (Cg, Od and Nd ), Glu58 (Cg, Cd, Oe1 and Oe2 ), Gln184 (Cg, Cd, Oe1 and Ne2) and Gln252 (Cg, Cd, Oe1 and Ne2); parts of two peripheral loops are disordered or flexible and could not be located in the electron density maps (Ser59 to Ala65 and Tyr249 to Glu250). The three N-terminal amino acid residues could not be defined so that the coordinate set starts with position Tyr4. Sequence tracing ends at position Ile282, because Pro283 and Val284 are not visible in the electron density map. The final coordinate set (PDB entry code 1VFN) contains 2102 protein atoms, the ten atoms of the hypoxanthine

The final R-value is 0.18 for 15,158 unique data in the resolution range 20.0 ° to 2.15 A, with no s cut-off applied. Refinement statistics are given in Table 8. Two cis-peptides were fitted to the electron density map. At position 198, there is a cis Pro, and another cis-peptide conformation is located at position Asn243Lys244. To confirm the energetically unfavorable conformation of the latter, and to minimize model bias, omit-map techniques were applied around residues 241 to 246 (with water oxygen atoms and inhibitor model omitted). This comprises conjugate-gradient minimization with TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987) and a simulatedannealing slow-cooling protocol with a starting ° temperature of 300 K at 20 to 2.15 A resolution (Brunger, ¨ 1992; Hodel et al., 1992). Both omit methods clearly verify the cis-peptide conformation. Tentative introduction of a trans-peptide at Asn243-Lys244 leads to an unallowed f/c combination. The omit Fo - Fc density of the critical region resulting from the simulated-annealing procedure is given at the 2.5 × r.m.s level in Figure 7.
