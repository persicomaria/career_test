ABSTRACT Structural data are reported for two highly potent antifolates, 2,4-diamino-5-[30 ,40 -dimethoxy-50 -(5-carboxy-1-pentynyl)]benzylpyrimidine (PY1011), with 5000-fold selectivity for Pneumocystis carinii dihydrofolate reductase (pcDHFR), relative to rat liver DHFR, and 2,4-diamino-5-[2methoxy-5-(4-carboxybutyloxy)benzyl]pyrimidine (PY957), that has 80-fold selectivity for pcDHFR. Crystal structures are reported for NADPH ternary complexes with PY957 and pcDHFR, refined ° to 2.2 A resolution; with PY1011 and pcDHFR, ° refined to 2.0 A resolution; and with PY1011 and ° mouse DHFR (mDHFR), refined to 2.2 A resolution. These results reveal that the carboxylate of the x-carboxyalkyloxy side chain of these inhibitors form ionic interactions with the conserved Arg in the substrate binding pocket of DHFR. These data suggest that the enhanced inhibitory activity of PY1011 compared with PY957 is, in part, due to the favorable contacts with Phe69 of pcDHFR by the methylene carbons of the inhibitor side chain that are oriented by the triple bond of the 1-pentynyl side chain. These contacts are not present in the PY957 pcDHFR complex, or in the PY1011 mDHFR complex. In the structure of mDHFR the site of Phe69 in pcDHFR is occupied by Asn64. These data also revealed a preference for an unusual parallel ring stacking interaction between Tyr35 of the active site helix and Phe199 of the C-terminal b sheet in pcDHFR and by Tyr33 and Phe179 in mDHFR that is independent of bound ligand. A unique His174­His187 parallel ring stacking interaction was also observed only in the structure of pcDHFR. These ring stacking interactions are rarely found in any other protein families and may serve to enhance protein stabilC ity. Proteins 2006;65:959­969. V 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

INTRODUCTION Opportunistic infections from Pneumocystis carinii (pc) and Toxoplasma gondii (tg) pathogens are still among the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in patients with AIDS or other forms of immunosuppression.1­3 The primary treatment for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP) combines a sulfonamide drug with trimethoprim (TMP) [Fig. 1(a)], an antifolate antibacterial that targets folate biosynthesis. In some cases, the antifolate piritrexim [PTX, Fig. 1(b)] has also been used clinically. The sulfa drugs target dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), while TMP and PTX inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). TMP has wide use as an antibiotic because it is a highly selective inhibitor of bacterial DHFR (IC50 (lM) 0.0001 for E. coli; 9000 for human; and 12 for pcDHFR).7­10 Although these drugs are widely used, combination therapy is not always successful, as TMP has limited efficacy and can result in drug resistance.7,8 Therefore, there is still a great need to develop more effective treatments, in particular lipophilic DHFR inhibitors that can combine the species selectivity of TMP with the potency of PTX. Earlier studies by Kuyper and coworkers9,10 had presented the hypothesis that 50 -(x-carboxyalkyloxy) derivatives of TMP would enhance ionic interactions with the positively charged active site residues in bacterial DHFR and thereby improve selectivity. The inhibitory activity data measured for a series of 50 -(x-carboxyalkyloxy) analogues showed that the most potent compound was the 50 -(x-carboxypentyloxy) derivative [Fig. 1(c)], which increases inhibition of E. coli DHFR 55-fold.

two of these analogues validated the interactions with the conserved Arg57 in the active site of E. coli DHFR.10 Concurrent studies on a series of related TMP analogues with a 40 -Br substituent (brodimoprim) that had 50 -O substituents revealed that the 4,6-dicarboxylate analogue [Fig. 1(d)] showed a 1000-fold tighter binding to Lactobacillus casei (lc) DHFR than brodimoprim, which was itself more potent than TMP.11,12 Analysis of the solution NMR data12 showed the carboxylates of this brodimoprim derivative interact with Arg57 and His28 of lcDHFR. Together these data support the hypothesis

that the interactions with the conserved active site Arg contributes significantly to inhibitory potency. As part of a larger program to design lipophilic DHFR inhibitors that would contain structural features of both TMP and PTX, Rosowsky and coworkers have synthesized a number of compounds that incorporated the 20 ,50 -dimethoxybenzyl substitution pattern of PTX with the diaminopyrimidine-5-(30 ,40 ,50 -trimethoxybenzyl) pattern of TMP.4­6 Additionally, the 50 -methoxy group was replaced by a series of O-alkyl or O-(x-carboxyalkyl) groups. These data (Table I) showed that the 20 -methoxy-50 -carboxybutyloxy derivative (PY957) [Fig. 1(e)] was the best inhibitor in this series with an 80-fold increase in selectivity and potency when compared with TMP.4 There was a similar pattern of enhanced potency and selectivity when the 50 methoxy oxygen was replaced by a carbon­carbon triple bond [PY981, Fig. 1(f)].5 However, the most significant enhancement in potency and selectivity came about when -x-50 -methoxy group in TMP is replaced by a -(5-x-carboxy1-pentynyl) substituent. This resulted in the compound PY1011 [Fig. 1(g)], which was 5000 fold selective for pcDHFR over rat liver DHFR.6 Both solution and solid state structural data have been reported for TMP and its derivatives as binary or ternary complexes with NADPH and DHFR from E. coli (ec),10­14 L. casei (lc),15,16 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb),17 chicken (ch),14,18 mouse (m),19,20 pc,21 human (h),22,23 bovine (b),24 and Staphylococcus aureus (sa).25 As illustrated in Table II and Figure 2, the conformation of DHFR-bound TMP or its analogues is similar for most DHFR enzyme structures. There are three major exceptions to this general profile--the conformation of TMP observed in the crystal structures of the binary complex with chDHFR (#14, Fig. 2), for Epiroprim observed in the ternary NADPH complex of the F31G mutant of hDHFR (#8, Fig. 2), and for the binary solution structure of bDHFR (#16, Fig. 2).

The conformational angles for the aromatic rings in TMP and Epiroprim may be affected by the size and conformation of the residue at position 31 in the active site of these DHFR enzymes. In chDHFR, position 31 is Tyr, observed in an alternate, less populated conformation (14), thus leaving a larger volume available for ligand binding. In the Epiroprim ternary NADPH complex with hDHFR, Phe31 is replaced by Gly, again leaving a large open volume that could permit an alternate conformation for ligand binding. Since position 31 in bovine DHFR is Phe, it is not clear why an unusual conformation was observed for TMP.24 Analysis of the structures of TMP in the complex with E. coli and chDHFR13,14 showed differences in the interactions of the trimethoxybenzyl moiety with the enzyme binding pocket that reflect differences in its conformation when compared with other TMP complexes (Fig. 2). In addition, there was a loss of a hydrogen bond between the 4-amino group of the pyrimidine ring that caused TMP to lie more deeply in the active site pocket of chDHFR. These data were interpreted to indicate that these changes contributed to the weaker binding of TMP in chDHFR and hence its lower inhibitory potency than to E. coli DHFR. Further analysis of these data suggests that additional conformational subgroups are possible. As shown (Fig. 2), there is a clustering in the distribution according to whether the DHFR structure is a ternary complex (diamonds) with conformations around the torsion angle C4­ C5­C7­C10 [TMP, Fig. 1(a)] of 1808 and torsion angle C5­ C7­C10 -C20 ) of 758, or a binary complex (circles) with torsion angles near 2008 and 708. Also these data show that the solution NMR conformations (Fig. 2, open symbols) tend to be observed near the extremes of the clusters for ternary or binary complexes. There is one exception to the tight cluster of ternary complexes which places the ecDHFR-TMP14 binary complex (Fig. 2, #13) in the ternary complex profile. The reason for this conformational exception is not clear.

° ° complex to 2.2 A resolution, and to 2.2 A resolution for the mDHFR PY1011 complex. Data were collected to ° 1.6 A resolution on beamline A1 at CHESS (Cornell University) for the pcDHFR PY1011 complex; however, ° much of the data was sparse beyond 2.0 A resolution. All data were processed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK.31 The lattice parameters and crystal properties are listed in Table III for these ternary complexes. Structure Determination and Refinement All structures were solved by molecular replacement methods with CNS32 using coordinates for pcDHFR (1D8R) and for mDHFR (1Ok7). Models of PY957 and PY1011 were generated from the crystal structure of TMP and optimized with SYBYL (Tripos, 1997). Between least-squares minimizations, the structures were manually adjusted to fit difference electron density and verified by a series of omit maps calculated from the current model with deleted fragments. Simulated annealing methods using the program CNS were used to refine the DHFR inhibitor complexes in combination with the modeling building program CHAIN.33 The Rfree was based on a test set with 10% selection criteria in each data set. All calculations were carried out on a Silicon Graphics Impact R10000 Workstation. Data were refined to their resolution limits (Table III). The initial difference electron density map, calculated with structure factors based on the protein model only, resulted in electron density corresponding to the inhibitor and cofactor for all structures. The Ramachandran conformational parameters generated by PROCHECK35 for the final model from the last cycle of refinement are listed in Table III. The lack of interpretable electron density for loop 83­88 in both pcDHFR complexes indicates that this region is highly mobile and represents an alternate conformational state when compared with those observed in other pcDHFR complexes.36­39 Models for the mouse DHFR structure were similar to those previously reported.19,20,40 Coordinates for these structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (Table III). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Overall Structure The overall characteristics of the fold in the mDHFR and pcDHFR complexes are similar to those reported previously (Fig. 3).36­40 The lack of interpretable electron density for loop 83­88 of these pcDHFR complexes indicates that this region is highly mobile and represents an alternate conformational state when compared with those observed in other pcDHFR complexes.36­40 There is also a cis peptide linkage between Arg67 and Pro68 and Gly124 and Gly125, as observed in other pcDHFR complexes. Similar observations are made for the mDHFR ternary complex. Inhibitor Binding The interactions of the 2,4-diaminopyrimidine ring of PY957 and PY1011 preserve the overall pattern of contacts with invariant residues in the mDHFR and pcDHFR

Other examples of DHFR complexes with antifolates that have a 2,4-diaminopyrimidine ring are the potent pc-selective compound TAB26 and the antimalarial pyrimethamine (PYR) bound to the bifunctional DHFR-TS (thymidylate synthase) enzyme from Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax.27,28 To understand these pcDHFR inhibitor structure-activity data, we report herein the first structural data for the NADPH ternary complexes of the potent and selective pcDHFR inhibitors, PY1011 and PY957 with pcDHFR, and of PY1011 with mDHFR. These structures are compared with other TMP DHFR complexes.13­22 METHODS Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection Recombinant pcDHFR was cloned, expressed, and purified as previously described.29 The protein was washed in a centricon-10 three times with 46 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0), 100 mM KCl, and concentrated to 17.5­19.0 mg mL­1 of pcDHFR. The protein was incubated with a 10-fold excess of PY957 or PY1011 and NADPH at 48C for 2­4 h prior to crystallization using hanging drop vapor diffusion methods at 48C. Protein droplets of pcDHFR complexes contained 33% PEG 2K, 46 mM MES, pH 6 with 100 mM KCl. mDHFR was expressed and purified as described elsewhere.30 The mouse protein was washed with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and concentrated to 26.2 mg mL­1. Crystals of mDHFR grew from solution #28 (0.17M Na acetate, pH 6.5, 0.085M Na cacodylate, 25.5% PEG 4K) in the Hampton Cryo Screen (Hampton Research). Cryogenic solutions for the pcDHFR crystals were prepared using mother liquor with a 16­ 24% gradient of ethylene glycol. These crystals tended to grow as thin plates. This may have resulted in the poor statistics observed for some of the resolution ranges. Data were collected at liquid nitrogen temperatures on a Rigaku RaxisIV area detector for the pcDHFR PY957

active sites (Fig. 4). As observed in other DHFR inhibitor complexes, a hydrogen bond network involving structural water, the conserved residues Thr144, Trp27 and the acidic function (Glu32, pcDHFR numbering), and the N1 nitrogen and 2-amino group of PY957 and PY1011, is maintained. Similarly, the inhibitor 4-amino group maintains its contacts with the conserved residues Ile9 and Tyr129 and NADPH (pcDHFR numbering). The binding orientation of the diaminopyrimidine ring of these analogues is similar to that observed for most TMP DHFR complexes,13­22 but differs from that observed for the potent diaminopyrimidine antifolate, TAB,26 in which the tilt of the pyrimidine ring plane was nearly 208 from that of TMP.21 Trimethoprim has two principal degrees of conformational flexibility with respect to rotation about the C5­C7 and C7­C10 bonds [Fig. 1(a)]. As illustrated [Table II, Fig. (2)], the torsion angles for the TMP bridging group in PY957 [#1, Fig. (2)] fall outside the tight grouping for the cluster of ternary complexes and differ from those observed for the PY1011 ternary complexes with pcDHFR and mDHFR (#2,3, Fig. 2). It is of interest to note that the approximate orthogonal orientation of the pyrimidine and benzyl rings of PY957 (#1, Fig. 2) places the 20 -methoxy substituent over the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor NADPH in a way as to allow that the 20 -methoxy carbon to form close ° hydrophobic contacts (2.9­3.1 A) with the nicotinamide ring atoms C, C2, and C5. The only other contact to the ° 20 -methoxy substituent is to Leu25 (4.0­4.1 A).

The orientation of the benzyl ring of PY1011 is twisted away from perpendicular plane (#2,3, Fig. 2) in both the pcDHFR and mDHFR NADPH PY1011 ternary complexes. This conformation places the benzyl ring further away ° from the nicotinamide ring (3.5 A) and closer to Leu25 ° (3.5­3.8 A), similar to that observed in the mtbDHFR and pcDHFR TMP NADPH ternary complexes.17,21 The intermolecular contacts to the 40 -methoxy substitutuent of PY1011 in mDHFR or pcDHFR ternary complexes with both are weaker than those for the 30 methoxy substitutent in either the mDHFR or pcDHFR PY1011 or pcDHFR NADPH TMP.21 The closest hydrophobic contacts to the 40 -methoxy carbon atom of ° ° PY1011 are to Phe31 CZ (3.8 A) and Leu25 CD1 (4.5 A) ° ) and Leu25 CD1 in mDHFR, and to Ile33 CD1 (5.2 A ° (4.2 A) in pcDHFR. In the ternary complex of pcDHFR with TMP and NADPH, these contacts are tighter with ° ° Ile33 CD1 (4.1 A) and Leu25 CD1 (3.8 A).21 The most notable feature of PY957 and PY1011 binding in these DHFR complexes is the orientation of the 50 -xcarboxyalkyloxy side chain. As anticipated, the carboxylate group of both inhibitors forms close contacts to the conserved Arg75 [Fig. 5(a)]. Additionally, the conformation of Phe69 in the two pcDHFR complexes is similar. Differences in the inhibitor bridge conformation of PY957 and PY1011 (Table II, Fig. 2), and the orienting effect of the partially rigid 1-pentynyl moiety result in placing the methylene carbons of the PY1011 side chain

° closer to Phe69 than those in PY957 (3.8 vs 4.3 A). These contacts are not present in the structure of the mDHFR PY1011 NADPH complex, as position Phe69 in pcDHFR is replaced by Asn64 which normally interacts with the p-aminobenzoyl carbonyl of folates or MTX. The closest approach of the methylene carbons in the ° side chain of PY1011 in mDHFR to Asn64 is 4.9 A. These differences may help explain the enhanced potency of PY1011 for pcDHFR when compared with that for mDHFR or for PY957 with pcDHFR. In the case of TMP bound to pcDHFR, the inhibitor does not fill the substrate glutamate binding pocket, allowing Phe69 to adopt an alternate conformation21 [Fig. 5(b)]. A detailed analysis of the intermolecular contacts involving the inhibitor side chain carboxylate and the conserved active site Arg revealed that the orientation and conformation of Arg75 of pcDHFR or Arg70 in mDHFR is fixed by a network of conserved hydrogen bond contacts from the side chain of residues Thr40 and Ser41 of the active site helix in pcDHFR [Fig. 6(a)] or Thr38 and Thr39 of mDHFR [Fig. 6(b)], and the backbone carbonyl and amide groups of Lys73 and Phe69 of pcDHFR or Lys68 and Asn64 in mDHFR. Additional contacts are mediated through a structural water molecule that connects the inhibitor with the C-helix (residues 64­75 in pcDHFR). In the case of the mDHFR PY1011 NADPH ternary complex [Fig. 6(b)], the conformation of Lys68 is such that its amine group occupies the water position and forms hydrogen bond contacts with the inhibitor carboxylate and with the backbone carbonyl function of Asn64. Cofactor Binding The cofactor NADPH is bound in an extended conformation similar to other pcDHFR cofactor complexes.36­40 The conformations along the cofactor backbone in these complexes more

closely resemble those observed in the MTX ternary pcDHFR complex36 than those for the TMP ternary pcDHFR complex.21 The carboxamide group of the nicotinamide ring, which is syn to the nicotinamide ring N, makes a series of strong hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyls of the conserved residues Ile10 and Ile-123 in pcDHFR and Ile7 and Val115 in mDHFR. The conserved cis peptide linkage between the invariant Gly124 and Gly125 permits interaction with the pyrophosphate oxygens positioned at the end of the central helix C (residues 64­75 pcDHFR numbering).

Ring Stacking Interactions Further analysis of the tertiary structure of these DHFR complexes revealed the presence of unusual parallel ring stacking interactions between Tyr35 of the active site helix and Phe199 near the C-terminal b-sheet in pcDHFR and Tyr33 and Phe179 in mDHFR (Fig. 7). These stacking interactions are independent of bound ligand in the enzyme active site, and are present in other DHFR structures (see 1dhy.pdb). The contact dis° tance between ring centroids is 3.5 A. A search of the literature reveals that such parallel ring stacking is not common in proteins in general, as most aromatic ring ° intramolecular contacts are observed at 5.6 A with an angle of 578 from their centroids.42,43 It is of interest to

note that in these structures, ring stacking involves a Phe seven residues from the C-terminus of the enzyme sequence (Table IV). Since the ring stacking involves a residue near the C-terminus of the DHFR sequence, these contacts may help stabilize the enzyme structure and anchor the active site helix. Further analysis of the pcDHFR structure revealed a second ring stacking interaction involving His174 and ° His187 (closest approach 3.7 A) (Fig. 7). In the pcDHFR structure, His174 is at the end of a short helix while His187 is in a long loop section. Inspection of the pcDHFR structure reveals that the two ring stacking sites are connected via a water molecule that makes

hydrogen bond contacts to the ND1 atom of His174 ° ° (3.0 A) and to the backbone carbonyl of Phe199 (2.8 A). As illustrated (Fig. 8), when the mDHFR structure is compared with pcDHFR, this loop segment is shorter. When the structure of mDHFR was analyzed, no His interactions were observed. Inspection of the DHFR sequences for these structures (Table IV) reveals that there are only two histidine residues in mDHFR, three in hDHFR and six in pcDHFR. None of the histidine residues in mDHFR or hDHFR are close enough to make contact. These unusual parallel stacking interactions in the pcDHFR structure may help stabilize a highly flexible region of the pcDHFR sequence.

CONCLUSIONS This is the first reported structural analysis of pcDHFR and mDHFR as NADPH ternary complexes with the potent and selective antifolates PY1011 and PY957. The data provide insight into the features that contribute to the 5000 fold enhanced selectivity of PY1011 for pcDHFR when compared with that for the mammalian enzyme. These compounds validate the hypothesis that 2,4-diaminopyrimidines with an extended x-carboxyalkyloxy side chain at the 50 -position of the trimethoprim (TMP) benzyl ring form more favorable interactions with pcDHFR than with the mammalian enzyme. This analysis also shows the TMP bridge conformation for PY957 (179/918) to be outside the tight cluster observed for PY1011 both in pcDHFR and mDHFR (179/ 748), as well as other ternary TMP complexes (Table II, Fig. 2). In this conformation the PY957 20 -methoxy substitutent makes close intermolecular contacts with the entire nicotinamide ring. Furthermore, this conformation also permits the

50 -x-carboxybutyloxy side chain to interact optimally with the conserved Arg in the active site. In the case of PY1011, the TMP bridging torsion angles are similar in both the pcDHFR and mDHFR complexes, and the 208 tilt (#2,3, Fig. 2) from the PY957 conformation, moves the benzyl ring away from the nicotinamide ring when compared with PY957. However, it is the directing effect of the semi rigid 1pentynyl substitutent of the side chain that helps maintain the optimal carboxylate contacts with the conserved Arg75 of pcDHFR (Arg70 mDHFR). As shown [Fig. 5(a)], there is a difference in the conformation of the PY1011 50 -(x-carboxy1-pentynyl) side chain in pcDHFR and mDHFR complexes that permits enhanced hydrophobic interactions of the PY1011 methylene carbons with Phe69 in pcDHFR that are not present in the mDHFR complex, in which Phe69 is replaced by Asn64. The addition of the 30 , 40 -methoxy substitution pattern in PY1011, compared with the 20 -methoxy substitution pattern in PY957 mimicking the TMP benzyl ring sub-

However, the 40 -methoxy hydrophobic interactions of PY1011 in the mDHFR ternary complex are more compact, as the in-

hibitor makes closer hydrophobic contacts with Phe31 and Leu22. These differences may contribute to the increased selectivity of these inhibitors for pcDHFR. Analysis of these structures has also brought to light unique intramolecular interactions not been previously described for DHFR structures. Parallel ring stacking

interactions were observed in both pcDHFR and mDHFR between Tyr35 (pcDHFR numbering) on the active site helix and Phe199 seven residues from the end of the Cterminal b-sheet. Such parallel ring stacking interactions are also not common in protein structures.42,43 Since these contacts involve a C-terminal b-sheet element, they may play a role in stabilizing the DHFR structure. In addition, unusual antiparallel ring stacking interactions between His174 and His187 were observed in pcDHFR but not in mDHFR. As illustrated (Fig. 7), this His­His stacking occurs in a long, highly flexible loop region of pcDHFR. Although this region of mDHFR is also in a loop region, it is much shorter and therefore may be more stable. Since there are few His residues in mammalian DHFR sequences (Table IV; mDHFR has two His; pcDHFR has six His), the role of this interaction in pcDHFR may be in stabilizing its tertiary structure. Mutagenesis studies can be carried out to better understand the role of these interactions in DHFR enzyme stability.
