Received 30 June 1992 Site-directed nautagen¢fi5was used to investigate the role of acidic amino acid residues close to the active site of Torpedo acetylcholinesterase. The recently determined atomic structure of this enzyme shows the conserved Glu.327, together with His-440 and Set-200 as forming a catalytic triad, while the adjacent conserved Asp-326 points away from the active site. Transfeetioa of appropriately mutated DNA into COS cells showed that the mutation of Asp-326~Asn had little effect on catalytic activity or the molecular forms expressed, sulggestin8no crucial structural or functional role for this residue. Mutation of Glu-327 to Gin or to Asp led to an inactive product. These results support the conclusionsof the structural analysis for the two acidic residues.

1. I N T R O D U C T I O N The principal biological role of acetylcholinesterase (ACHE, EC 3.1.1.7) is the termination of impulse transmission at cholinergic synapses by hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine [1]. In keeping with this functional requirement, AChE is an extremely rapid enzyme, operating, under optimal conditions, at a rate approaching that at which substrate diffusion becomes rate-limiting [2]. Kinetic studies suggest that the catalytic mechanism of AChE is rather complex. The chemical steps of acylation and deacylation of the active-site serine are preceded by a conformational step [3]. In addition, the influence of the isotopic ratio in D20/H.~O solvents indicates the transfer of a single proton, suggesting that a charge relay system, such as that believed to operate in the serine proteases [4], which involves several protons, is not functional in this case [2,5]. The recent determination of the three-dimensional atomic structure of AChE from Torpedo californicaper. mits, for the first time, direct visualization of its active site [6]. In particular, this structure shows that the active-site serine (Set-200) forms a catalytic triad similar to that observed in chymotrypsin [4]. The participation of His-440 in such a triad had previously been inferred,

since it is the only histidine residue conserved within the family of cholinesterases and homologous enzymes [7], and its mutagenesis to glutamine totally abolished catalytic activity [8]. The three-dimensional structure indeed placed His-440 within hydrogen-bonding distance of Ser2000~,nm~ [6]. The acidic member of the thud, Glu327, had not been identified previously. In all serine hydrolase structures solved hitherto, this residue was an aspartic acid. Torpedo AChE [6], and the structurally related lipas¢ from Geotrichumcandidum, the structure of which was also solved only recently [9], are the first cases reported in which Asp is replaced by Glu. It is interesting that Glu-327 is replaced by an aspartic residue in some of those esterases which present a clear homology of their primary structure with that of the cholinesterases [7]. In addition, this residue is immediately preceded by an aspartic acid in all known primary structures of cholinesterases. In the present study we report the effect of site-directed mutagenesis o f Asp- 326 and Glu-327 on the catalytic activity of TorpedoACHE. 2. M A T E R I A L S A N D M E T H O D S

This sequence corresponds to nucleotides 1017-1060, in the coding orientation; it contains a Balll r~triction site (underlined). Either one or two of the O nucleotides marked by asterisks (I 048, 105 i, and 1053) were replaced by other nucleotldgs: G ~as~-Cfor Glu-327---~Asp, G ~0~.C for Glu-327~GIn, G ~ - A for Asp-326~Asn, and a combination of the last two changes for the double mutation Asp.326~Asn/Olu. 327~Gln. The common primer was in tile antisense orientation, and was complementary to nucleotides 1671-1695 of 2AChE 15-2: 5'TCG'I'FTGGG1-rTCCAOTCTTTGCO-3'.

buffer, and sterile water to 50/el. Amplification was per/brined as follows: 40 cycles of I rain at 92°C; 1 rain at 55'C; 3 rain at 72°C, in an Hybaid heating block. The amplification mixture was electrophoresed in an agarose gel, and the amplification product was extracted, digested by Bglll and Nsil, and ligated to CDMg-AChF.-r, from which the corresponding fragment had b e e n removed by digestion with Bgfll and Nsil, as described previously [11]. Competent bacteria were transformed with the ligation product, and plasmidic DNA from selected transformants was fully sequenced and used for transfecting COS cells aa described [11]. After four days at 27°C, the transfected cells were extracted in 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris-HCI pH 7, and the extract was assayed for AChE activity colorimetrically, according to Ellman et al. [12] using acetylthiocholine as the substrat¢, or radiometrically, according to Johnson and Russell II 3], using [~H]ac~tylcholine as substrate. Activesltc titration, using the organophosphate inhibitor, O-athyl-S"-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonothionate, was performed accordin~ to Vigny et al. [14]. Western blots were performed with the rabbit anti-Torpedo AChE antiserum, Tor-152, as described [11], Sucrose gradient analysis of molecular forms was carried out as d~seribed previously [11].

Fig. 1. Western blots showing the production of Torpedo AChE protein in translated COS cells. Extracts from cells transfeeted with the wild-type and mutated constructions were analyzed in Western blots, using tile monoclonal antibody Tot-ME8 (1/200). The amino acids at positions 326 and 327 are indicated below each lane; the right hand lane corresponds to the wild-type sequence. In all cases, the T subunit appears at the same position in the gel, with a similar intensity. It does not correspond to any Tor-ME8 reactive protein in non-transfected COS cells.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We showed earlier that transfected COS cells produce active Torpedo AChE when transferred from 37°C to 27°C [11]. In the present experiments, we transfected COS cells with CDM8 vectors carrying the coding sequence of the T catalytic subunit (which generates collagen-tailed AChE in Torpedo electric organs), either in its wild-type form or after mutagenesis of either Asp326 or Glu-327. The mutagenized sequences were constructed by exchanging restriction fragments in the wild-type vector, CDMS-AChEv. Since the vectors differ only at the mutagonized options, expression is unlikely to be affected by the mutations. We checked, however, that all transfeetions produced similar amonnts of To#Te¢loAChE protein, as recognized by the monoclonal antibody, TotME8 [15) (Fig. 1). The product of the mutation Asp-326--~Asn was expressed at a level of catalytic activity similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. Under the conditions of the radiometric assay, active-site titration showed it to have a specific activity ca. 50% of that of the wild-type, Moreover, the mutation did not modify the pattern of molecular forms of A C h E produced in -the trr, nsfected C O S cells,yielding O~", G" and a low level of G~ forms [l I]. It is thus clear that Asp-326 is not essential either for the catalytic machinery of A C h E or for the establish422 ment and maintenance of the correct conformation. It should be remembered that, even at 27°C, COS cells produce mostly inactive, most probably misfolded, Torpedo ACHE. A perturbation in the acquisition of the correct folding pattern would, therefore, be expected to decrease the yield of active enzyme markedly. Although Asp-326 is conserved in cholinesterases [7], the lack of a substantial effect upon its replacement by Asn is consistent with the fact that it is substituted by other amino acids in a number of eholinesterase-like proteins: Glu in some cases, but also His, Ser, Met or Gly [7]. In contrast, mutations Glu-327---~Gln, Glu327---)Asp, and the double mutation, Asp-236--~Asn/ GIu-327~GIn, resulted in almost complete loss of enzymic activity, in agreement with the involvement of Glu-327 in a catalytic-site triad, whether as part of a charge-relay system or in a different functional or structural capacity [5]. Similar findings have been reported recently for human AChE [16]. It is particularly interesting that aspartatc cannot substitute for glutamate in ACHE, even though some eholinesterase-like enzymes (viz. Drosophila esterase P ~na esterase 6, rat !ysophospholipase) possess an asuartie acid at the homologous position [7]. It is also worth noting that the non-catalytic cholinesterase-like proteins also present acidic residues at this position, either

Glu (Drosophila neurotactin) or Asp (Drosophila glutactin, mammalian thyroglobulin). In addition, these proteins contain a histidine residue at the position expected for that element of the catalytic triad, but do not possess a serine at the predicted position. The presence of both the acidic residue and the histidine in noncatalytic proteins may represent a non-functlonal inheritance from catalytically active ancestors; alternatively, an interaction between these two residues may be a requirement for maintaining the three-dimensional structure of the protein. In the three-dimensional structure of Torpedo ACHE, as determined by Sussman et al. [6], the spatial arrangement of the three segments of the polypeptide backbone which bear the residues of the catalytic triad is such that an aspartic residue at position 327 would be too short to interact with His-440. The fact that we do not find any activity in the Glu-327-.->Asp mutant shows that the structure is not flexible enough to compensate for the 3-A distance. This rigidity contrasts with the apparent existence of an induced-fit step preceding the acylationdecylation reactions [3]. The present results confirm the existence of a catalytic triad, Glu-327/His-440/Ser-200, in TorpedoACHE. This is quite consistent with kinetic evidence indicating the presence of a charge-relay system in the homologous enzymes, butyrylcholinesterase and cholesterol esterase. In these latter enzymes, proton inventory analyses of the influence of the isotope ratio in D~.O/H:O media indicate the transfer of several protons during catalysis (D. Quinn, personal communication). The fact that similar analyses show that a single proton is transferred in AChE illustrates the originality of this exceptionally rapid enzyme. Its detailed mechanism remains a puzzle, and a fascinating subject for future research.
