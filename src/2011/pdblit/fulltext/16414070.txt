A disulfidc bond-forming enzyme was purified from the cytosol of the archaebactcrium SulJolobrtssoljkuricus, strain MT-L The enzyme, assayed by its ability to oxidize and reactivate reductively denatured ribonuclcasc A, had a small molecular size and displayed a high thcnostability. The N-terminal amino acid sequence is reported. Archaebacteria; Disulfide bond formation: Thermostable enzyme

1. INTRUDUCTION In vivo disulfide bond formation occurs during or soon after translation. This process is significantly faster than in vitro oxidative folding systems, so the need for in vivo biocatalysts ha8 been recognized for a long time. The best characterized system is the formation of native disulfide bonds catalyzed by protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) (reviewed in [l]). PDI, as detected in most vertebrate tissues, is a homodimer (2 x 57,000 Da) with a highly acidic PI. The fomlation, reduction and isomerization of disulfide bonds can be catalyzed by PDI, the product of its action depending on the initial substrates and imposed redox potential. The enzyme is usually assayed by observing the rearrangement of scrambled ribonuclease A (srRNAse, the form containing incorrectly paired disulfide bonds) to the native enzyme in the presence of a low thiol concentration. The primary structure of PDI shows two homologous regions closely related to the thioredoxin active site, that is a redox dithioYdisulfide center formed by vicinal cysteine residues. Thioredoxin (TH) is a small (~12,000 Da) acidic protein found in prokaryotes, yeast, plants and mammalian cells (reviewed in [2]). It is a multifunctional protein which catalyzes disulfide reduction and participates in other redox processes. Pigiet and Schuster [3] demonstrated that TH can reactivate both

srRNAse and reductively denatured ribonuclease (rdRNAse), raising the possibility that TH can have an additional in vivo role in protein folding. A metalloglycoprotcin, named sulfhydryl oxidase, from bovine milk (M, 300,000) is known to catalyze the de novo synthesis of disulfide bonds in cysteinecontaining peptides and proteins [4]. A soluble sulfhydryl oxidase (Mr 66,000) which also catalyzes disulfide bond formation in proteins has been isolated from the mammalian male reproductive tract [5J. Unlike PDI, sulfhydry1 oxidase does not catalyze disulfide interchange. To date, no PDI or sulfhydryl oxidase from bacterial sources have been reported. Because disulfide bond formation is a general process for newly synthesized polypeptide chains, we searched for a protein catalyzing this event at high temperature in extracts of the extreme thermophilic archaebacterium Sulfolobus solfataricus, strain MT-4, which grows at 87'C. The purificrltion of a highly thermostable enzyme which oxidizes and reactivates rdRNAse is reported here. The molecular weight and N-terminal amino acid sequence of this disulfide bond-forming (DBF) enzyme have been determined. 2. EXPERIMENTAL

Samples were incubated al LOO"C 15min in 2% SDS, 5% 2.mercaptoethanol,5% glycerol; the for run was performed using a 5% stacking gel and a 15%separating gel, The calibration kit in the range 43-2.3 kDa was supplied by Gibco BRL. Proteins were revealed by the Sigma silver staining kit. 2.8. N-TerWtd who acid ,wquence The sample from exclusion chromatography was dialyzed against water and loaded on a C,, reverse-phase HPLC column (Varian, 4x150 mm) developed with a O-SO% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The sequence analysis was performed by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Mod. 477A Sequencer. The method used was that supplied by the manufacturer.

RNAse activity was determined according to Kunitt [lo], by following the decrease at 300 nm of a solution of 0.5 m&n1 yeast RNA in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.2, at 30°C. 2.5.2. Reoxidation and reactivation of rdRNAse. A solution of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. containing 15,&I rdRNAse and DBF (approx# 50 fig) was incubated at 30°C in a vial exposed to air. An identical mixture containing buffer in the place of the enzyme represented the control (air oxidation rate). At lhe desired times, duplicate samples were removed to measure the sulfh~ dry1 concentration and the RNAse activity. The percent of activity regained was calculated relative to the rate obtained with an equivalent amount of native RNAse (100% activity). 2.5.3. Disulfide reduction of insulin (thioredoxin-like activity). The catalytic reduction of insulin by DTT was measured at 30°C by the method of Holmgrcn [I 11,DBF (approx. 100 ~6) was added in 1 ml of 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7,O.conlaining 2 mM EDTA and 1 mg of bovine insulin. A control cuvette contained only buffer and insulin. The reaction was started by the addition of I mM DTT to both cuvettes. increasing turbidity from precipitation of insulin B chain was recorded at 650 nm. 26. PuriJiw~ionof DBF en:yntuUc ociisity The extreme thermoacidophilic archaebactcrium, S~rljolobusSO/J& ruricrrs, strain MT-4, was grown aerobically al 87'C and pH 3.0 [ 121. 50 g of bacteria underwent freeze-thawing twice, were added to 50 g sand and 10 ml 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 M NaCI. 5% glycerol, and homogenized in a Homni Mixer. The homogcnate was centrigufed at 4,000 x g for 20 min to remove [he sand: the supernatant solution wascentrifuged at 160,000 xg for 90 minat 4°C and the residue was discarded. From a typical prcparalion, about 2.3 g of protein were obtairled starting from 50 g of bacteria. The crude extract was stored at -20°C in aliquots of 200 mg. 2.6.1. Step 1: DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography. The crude extract (200 mg) was extensively dialyzed (Spectra/Par membrane tubing cut-off 3,500) against 100 ~01s.of 10 mM Tris-HCI buffer, pH 8.4 (Buffer A). The dialyzed solution was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia, 1.5~15 cm) previously equilibrated with Buffer A at 4°C. Flow rate was 30 ml/h. The Bow-through, containing all DBF activity, was concentrated by a vacuum centrifuge. 2.6.2. Step 2: Mono Q FPLC chtomalography The enzyme solution (2s mg) was dialyzed overnight against Buffer A and applied in 2 separate runs to a Mono Q column (PharmacL,

3. RESULTS The enzyme (designated DBF) has been purified by a procedure which exploits its charge and molecular size. The lack of time-consuming steps allows one to obtain pure enzyme in a few days. Fig. I shows the SDS-PAGE analysis of the active sample after each purification step. DBF did not bind to strong anionic exchanger Mono Q at pH 8.4, thus revealing its extremely basic nature. The protein peaks eluted from DEAE and Mono Q columns by salt gradients behaved as a control when assayed for rdHNAse oxidation activity. The active sample after Mono Q displayed a marked increase of activity with respect to the preceding step. The gel filtration chromatography gave rise to almost pure DBF, as judged from SDS-PAGE. Cationic chromatography (strong or weak exchanger) performed at pH 6.0 (phosphate buffer), 7.0 or 8.0 (phosphate and Tris buffers) markedly inactivated DBF. The elution volume of DBF on Superdex 75 column corresponded to a molecular weight below cytochrome c. The enzyme ran as a band of Mr 6,200 on reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). 3.2. Kinetic studies The active sample was recognized throughout the purification steps by its ability to reoxidize and reactivate rdRNAse. The enzyme obtained from gel filtration chromatography was utilized for all kinetic studies. No ribonucfease activity was measured when the rdRNAse substrate was omitted from the incubation mixture. Fig. 2 shows typical data for DBF-catalyzed reoxidation and reactivation of rdRNAse at 30%; DBF greatly en-

ual thiol groups of rdRNAse were 2 and 1.3 at 45 and 55°C respectively, vs. 4.2 detected at 30°C (see Fig. 2). The first 12 amino acid residues of DBF were AlaThr-Val-Lys-Phe-Lys-Tyr-Lys-Gly-Glu-GIu-Lys. This sequence did not indicate any homology to those PDIs whose sequences have been determined. DBF shared the first 4 residues with thioredoxin isolated from Gorynebacrerium nephridii 1141. 4. DISCUSSION

hanced thiol oxidation and RNAse activity regain compared tb a control. The absence of a linar relationship between the oxidation of -SH groups and RNAse activity regain is well known for the rdRNAse renaturation process. Even at room temperature DBF catalyzed a significantly faster reaction with respect to the spontaneous event (not shown). DBF was completely ineffective in catalyzing the disulfide reduction of insulin (thioredoxin-like activity). DBF was highly thermostable: heating to 90°C for 2 h did not cause loss of activity. DBF is a real thermophilic biocatalyst in that the reaction rate increased with increasing temperature: after 30 min incubation, resid-

This communication describes the purification from the cytosol of the archaebacterium Sulfolobus solfrtruricus, strain MT-4, of a low molecular weight enzyme (designed DBF) which catalyzes the disulfide bond formation in reductively denatured RNAse. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the isolation of a disulfide bond-forming enzyme from an extreme thermophile. DBF differed from classical PDIs in molecular size and charge. On the other hand, DBF failed to catalyze the specific thioredoxin-dependent reduction of disulfide bonds in bovine insulin. Work is under way to understand whether DBF can catalyze re-folding from randomly oxidized scrambled RNAse. Determination of the complete primary structure of DBF is at present being carried out in order to provide further information. DBF showed a high thermostability (complete inactivation occurred after 7 h at 90°C) and it was active even at moderate temperatures. Enzymes isolated from thermophilic microorganisms are resistant to denaturing agents [15]; in this respect, DBF displayed a good stability in the presence of urea, methanol or SDS (unpublished results). Given its low molecular size, DBF could be a suitable tool to investigate the protein-assisted folding of thermostable proteins and, eventually, find practical application. In fact, recombinant proteins expressed in foreign hosts often accumulate in the cell in an inactive form (inclusion bodies) and enzymes like DBF can be very useful in assisting misfolded proteins to gain their active form.
