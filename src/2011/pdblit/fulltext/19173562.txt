Six 5-deoxy-5-morpholine, piperidine, and pyrrolidine of pyrimidine nucleosides have been synthesized and characterized. Their inhibitory action to ribonuclease A has been studied by biochemical analysis and X-ray crystallography. These compounds are moderate inhibitors of RNase A with mid-to-upper micromolar inhibition constants (Ki). The high resolution X-ray crystal structures of the RNase A-inhibitor complexes have shown that all inhibitors bind at the enzyme catalytic cleft with the pyrimidine nucleobase at the B1R2 subsites while the 5 group binds away from the main subsite P1, where P-O5 bond cleavage occurs, toward the solvent close to subsite P0. Structure-activity relationship analysis has demonstrated that the compounds with the larger group in the 5 position are more potent. Comparative structural analysis of these RNase A complexes with other similar RNase A-ligand complexes provides a structural explanation of their potency and suggests ways to improve their efficiency and selectivity. These inhibitors can be the starting point for the development of compounds that can be used as pharmaceuticals against pathologies associated with RNase A homologues such as human angiogenin, which is implicated in tumor induced neovascularization. 1. Introduction
Ribonucleases (RNases) are endonucleases that control posttranscriptionally the RNA population in cells. RNases and in particular RNase A,a have proven to be excellent model systems for the study of protein structure, folding and stability, and enzyme catalysis. However, during the past decade, members of the RNase A superfamily, the only enzyme family restricted to vertebrates,1 have also attracted considerable biomedical interest because their biological activities were linked to a variety of malignancies and infectious diseases.2 Further studies 3-6 have shown that most of these pathological conditions are linked to the ribonucleolytic activity of these proteins, and hence, inhibitors of their enzymatic activity could be potential pharmaceutical agents.7 The availability of high resolution structures for several members of the RNase A superfamily (human angiogenin, eosinophil ribonucleases) and the wealth of structural information from a large number of inhibitor complexes,

particularly with RNase A, have prompted structure assisted drug design efforts to discover potent and selective inhibitors for these enzymes. Several subsites exist within the central catalytic groove of RNases, where substrate RNA binds. These are defined as P0 · · · Pn, R0 · · · Rn, and B0 · · · Bn according to the phosphate, ribose, and base of RNA that bind, respectively (n indicates the position of the group with respect to the cleaved phosphate phosphodiester bond where n ) 1).8 In all RNases the main subsite P1 is conserved, whereas subsites B1 and B2 on each side of P1 are partially conserved. Nevertheless, B1 binds pyrimidines, while B2 has a strong base preference for purines. Structure-assisted inhibitor design efforts have mainly focused on the parental protein, RNase A, because of the high degree of conservation of the active site among the members of this superfamily and the feasibility for crystallographic studies with this protein. So far the binding of mononucleotide and dinucleotide substrate analogues has been studied,7,9-11 with the majority of these inhibitors having acidic groups such as phosphate or sulfate.11,12 All these compounds bind by anchoring their polar phosphate or sulfate group at the central subsite P1 of the enzyme and are rather moderate inhibitors with dissociation constants in the mid-to-upper micromolar range. The best inhibitor so far is pdUppA-3p with Ki values of 27 nM, 180 nM, and 360 µM for RNase A, EDN, and angiogenin, respectively,9,13,14 whereas transition state theory predicts pM values for genuine transition states.2 However, the major problem associated with these compounds is their transport across the biological membranes. The high negative charge on the phosphate group makes them difficult to use in vivo.7 More recently aminonucleosides with a carboxylate group have been identified as a new class of inhibitors of RNase A and angiogenin15 and the binding of the most potent in this series (Ki ) 103 µM), 3-N-piperidine-4-carboxyl-3-deoxy-ara-uridine (3Ne) was studied by X-ray crystallography,16 revealing a novel ligand-binding pattern.

The polarity of all these compounds may hinder their potential pharmaceutical use, since it may impede their cell permeability and bioavailability. Hence, we have turned our attention toward less polar compounds and we have synthesized and studied the binding of a series of uridine and thymidine analogues that have a morpholino, piperidino, or pyrrolidino group at the 5 position. Here, we present the synthesis, kinetic evaluation, and the high resolution crystal structures of the RNase A in complex with six compounds from this series. Their inhibitory potency is moderate, and their binding mode reveals that polar acidic groups are not necessary for the anchorage of the inhibitor in the active site. Furthermore, it seems that the 5 groups have a significant role in the potency of these inhibitors. This evidence can be the starting point for further design, since it indicates ways for improving their selectivity and efficiency.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Chemistry. The synthetic routes toward the 5-deoxy5-alkylaminouridine derivatives U1S-U4S and 5-deoxy-5alkylaminothymidine derivatives T3S and T4S are outlined in Schemes 1 and 2, respectively. 2.2. Biology. The inhibitory activity of the synthesized compounds against RNase A was initially studied by the agarose gel-based assay (Figure 1a). Lane 1 of the gel shows the most

intensity because of the presence of only control tRNA. As a result of the degradation of tRNA by RNase A, lane 2 has the least intensity. Lanes 3-5 of each gel contain tRNA and RNase A with increasing concentration of synthesized compounds U1S-U4S and T3S and T4S individually. The difference in intensity between lane 2 and lane 3 is maximum for compound U1S, and these differences gradually increase in lanes 4 and 5. The other uridine derivatives U2S, U3S, and U4S also exhibit some inhibitory activity as observed qualitatively, while the thymidine derivatives T3S and T4S show less activity. In a comparative agarose gel with equimolar concentrations of the compounds, the uridine analogue shows better activity than the thymidine analogue (Figure 1b). The ribonucleolytic activity of the compounds was further assessed by the precipitation assay (Figure 2). The percent reduction of the ribonucleolytic activity of all compounds for RNase A at the same concentration (0.32 mM) was compared. The activity of RNase A is reduced by 30% by compound U1S, while values for U2S, U3S, and U4S range from 17% to 12%. Compounds T3S and T4S show little inhibitory activity (reduction of ribonucleolytic activity around 5%). For determination of the inhibition constants by kinetic experiments, the reciprocal of reaction velocity has been plotted against inhibitor concentration for three different substrate concentrations (Figure 3). The linear Dixon plot for the three different concentrations of the same substrate intersects at an inhibitor concentration equal to the negative reciprocal of the inhibitor association constant. The plots of compound U1S and U2S are given in parts A and B of Figure 3, respectively, while those of compounds U3S, U4S, T3S, and T4S are given in the Supporting Information. The nature of the plots is indicative of competitive inhibition. The chemical structure and the inhibition constant values of the RNase A enzyme for the six compounds are shown in Table 1. Compound U1S is the most potent of the six compounds, and T3S and T4S are the least potent. 2.3. X-ray Crystallography. To elucidate the structural basis of inhibition, we have determined the crystal structure of RNase A in complex with U1S, U2S, U3S, U4S, T3S, and T4S. The crystallographic asymmetric unit of the monoclinic RNase A crystals used in this study contains two protein molecules (A and B).16 However, inhibitor molecules were found bound only in molecule A of the noncrystallographic RNase A dimer. This partial binding has also been observed in previous crystallographic studies with the same monoclinic crystals of RNase A 10,16-18 and might be attributed to the crystal lattice that impedes access to the active site of molecule B in the asymmetric unit. This phenomenon provided us with two structures (one free and one inhibitor complexed) from the same crystal, thus facilitating a comparative structural analysis of the binding of each ligand to RNase A. Upon binding to RNase A, each of the inhibitor displaces five water molecules from the active site of the free enzyme. There are no significant conformational changes in the catalytic site of RNase A upon ligand binding. The rms distances between the structures of free RNase A16 and those of the U1S-, U2S-, U3S-, U4S-, T3S-, and T4S-RNase A complexes are 0.13, 0.20, 0.15, 042, 0.21, and 0.21 Å for the CR atoms for 124 equivalent protein residues, respectively. The rms deviation of the CR positions between all six complexes ranges between 0.2 and 0.5 Å, revealing that the structural differences between the six complex structures are very small. These are mainly concentrated on the loop regions and are not related to the binding of the different inhibitors.

The structures of the U1S, U2S, U3S, and U4S complexes are defined at 1.6 Å resolution and contain 329, 312, 378, and 348 water molecules, respectively. The structures of the T3S and T4S complexes are determined at a slightly lower resolution (1.7 and 2.0 Å) and contain 213 and 166 water molecules, respectively. In addition, complexes U3S, U4S, and T3S contain two citrate molecules from the crystallization media while complex T4S contains one. Numbering scheme definitions for U2S and T3S are presented in Figure 9, and the same definition was used for the rest of the inhibitors. All atoms of the six inhibitor molecules are well defined within the sigmaA weighted 2Fo - Fc electron density map of the RNase A complexes (Figure 4). The only exception is inhibitor U1S where there is no sufficient electron density for the carboxyethyl group, and hence, this part of the inhibitor was not included in the model. The 5-morpholino, piperidino, or pyrrolidino group has higher temperature factors than the rest of the molecule and appears to be more mobile. Upon binding to RNase A, all inhibitor molecules adopt similar conformations. The glycosyl torsion angle adopts the frequently observed19 anti conformation. The ribose adopts the quite rare C4-exo puckering in the uridine derivatives, while

in the thymidine analogues T3S and T4S are found in the C2exo and O4-exo conformations, respectively. The rest of the backbone torsion angles are in the common range for protein bound pyrimidines.19 The morpholino, piperidino, and pyrrolidino moieties adopt the chair conformation, whereas the fivemembered pyrrolidine ring adopts an envelope conformation (Figure 5). The anchoring point for all six inhibitors is the pyrimidine base which binds at subsite B1 in the same manner as previous pyrimidine inhibitors (Figure 5). Subsite B1 is a pocket formed by His12, Val43, Asn44, Thr45, Phe120, and Ser123. The primary functional component of this subsite is Thr45, which forms two hydrogen bonds with pyrimidine: its main-chain NH donates a hydrogen to O2 of the uracil or thymine, and its O1 donates a hydrogen to N3 of thymine or uracil (Figure 6). In all six crystal structures of RNase A complexes the Thr45 side chain also hydrogen-bonds with the carboxylate of Asp83 like in previous RNase A-uridine complexes.20 Ser123 O forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with O4 as in previous RNase A complexes.21-23 The phenyl group of Phe120 sits on one side of the pyrimidine ring near O2, making van der Waals contacts. His12 C1 also contacts O2 on the same side of the ring. Val43 and Asn44 occupy the space on the opposite side, the mainchain carbonyl and R carbon of Asn44 contact O2, whereas the side chain atoms of Val43 lie in van der Waals contact distance from the pyrimidine ring. The ribose binds at subsite R2, and it is held in place by hydrogen bond interactions of its hydroxyl groups with the side chain atoms of Lys41 and His119 and by participating in an extended water-mediated hydrogen-bonding network along with the protein (Table 2). The 5-substituent group is pointing toward the solvent in a location close to but not at subsite P0, adopting a conformation imposed probably by the stereochemistry of the ligand (Figure 6). In all free RNase A structures reported so far the side chain of the catalytic residue His119 adopts two conformations, denoted as productive ( 1  160°) and nonproductive ( 1  -80°), which are related by a 100° rotation about the CR-C bond and a 180° rotation about the C -C bond.16,24-27 These conformations are dependent on the pH28 and the ionic strength

of the crystallization solution.29 Previous studies21 have shown that binding of ligand groups in P1 induces the productive conformation of the side chain of His119. In complexes U1S, U3S, U4S, and T4S the side chain of His119 is found in both alternative conformations, while in complexes U2S and T3S the side chain adopts the nonproductive conformation. These observations are consistent with the binding of the inhibitors away from subsite P1. Upon binding to RNase A, inhibitor molecules become partly buried. The solvent accessibilities of the free ligand molecules U1S, U2S, U3S, U4S, T3S, and T4S are 483, 477, 479, 465, 488, and 490 Å2, respectively. When bound, these molecular surfaces shrink to 241, 233, 241, 222, 241, and 225 Å2, respectively. This indicates that approximately 50% of the

surfaces of the ligand molecules become buried. Compounds U1S, U2S, and U4S on binding to RNase A make a total of 5 hydrogen bonds and 17 van der Waals interactions (U1S, 7 nonpolar/nonpolar, 10 polar/nonpolar; U2S, 5 nonpolar/nonpolar, 12 polar/nonpolar; U4S, 6 nonpolar/nonpolar, 11 polar/nonpo-

lar). U3S makes a total of 6 hydrogen bonds and 20 van der Waals interactions (9 nonpolar/nonpolar and 11 polar/nonpolar). T3S and T4S make a total of 3 hydrogen bonds and 19 and 15 van der Waals interactions, respectively (T3S, 8 nonpolar/ nonpolar, 11 polar/nonpolar; T4S, 5 nonpolar/nonpolar, 10 polar/ nonpolar). van der Waals interactions of the six ligands are presented in Table 3. Although the structures presented here are based on soaking experiments, data from RNase A cocrystallized with 5 mM of each inhibitor were also available at 2.0 Å resolution. Crystallographic analysis of these structures showed that all inhibitors were bound in exactly the same way as in the soaked crystals. 2.4. SAR Analysis. The kinetic results are summarized in Table 1. It seems that the diversity of structural skeleton of the 5-group has an impact on RNase A inhibition, since the potency of the six compounds ranges from 77 to 423 µM. Earlier kinetic studies13,30,31 had demonstrated that thymidine nucleotides bind to RNase A with Ki values comparable with those of uridine inhibitors. However, the uridine compounds tested in this work are more potent than the thymidine ones. This can be attributed to the interactions of the 2-hydroxyl group of the ribose with RNase A residues in the uridine compounds which are not possible with the thymidine compounds since these lack this group. The 2-hydroxyl group participates in hydrogen-bond interactions with the side chain atoms of P1 residues His12 and Lys41 (Table 2). Furthermore, they are also involved in watermediated interactions with His119 and Phe120 (Table 2) and van der Waals interactions with His12 and Lys41 (Table 3). These interactions are important for RNase catalysis and cannot be observed in most substrate analogues, which are frequently deoxynucleotides. Furthermore, it seems that the potency of the uridine inhibitors increases with the size of the 5-substituent with U1S which has the largest group, being the most potent of all six inhibitors, while U2S and U3S with 5-groups of similar size are almost equipotent. Similarly, T3S is slightly more potent than T4S, which has a slightly smaller 5-group (one atom difference). Therefore, it seems that despite the fact that the 5-group does not participate in any direct hydrogenbond interactions with the protein in any of the six inhibitors, it has a significant contribution to the potency of the inhibitor. In complexes U1S-U4S and T4S the 5-group does not

participate in any van der Waals interactions with protein residues either (Table 3). In contrast, in the thymidine complex with T3S, this group is involved in van der Waals interactions with Val43 (Table 3). U1S has a more polar group at the 5 position than the other five ligands, and although its position is not defined in the electron density map, we cannot rule out that it may also affect its capacity. 2.5. Comparative Structural Analysis. The B1 subsite has been shown to exhibit a strong base preference for pyrimidines,32 and the interactions of pyrimidine bases in this site have been examined by crystallography or NMR [complexes with d(CpA),23,33 UpcA,22,34 2,5-CpA,33,35 U3p, U2p,10 3CMP,23 araUMP,11 dUppA-3-p,36 pdUppA-3-p,14 pTppA-3p,37 and N3e 16]. From the kinetic constants it seems that all six inhibitors are moderate inhibitors of RNase A and the uridine inhibitors (U1S-U4S) have similar potency to the 3-N-alkylamino-3deoxy-ara-uridines (Ki ) 103 µM for the best inhibitor 3Ne of this family)15 and to 3CMP (Ki ) 103 µM)38 but much lower than that of araUMP (Ki ) 6 µM)11 and pTppA-3p (Ki ) 0.041 µM).13 Like the alkylamino-ara-uridines they also lack a phosphate or a sulfate group. Structural comparison of the binding of the pyrimidine derivatives presented in this study to the binding of araUMP to RNase A11 and to that of 3CMP38 shows that the pyrimidine bases and the ribose of the inhibitors superimpose well while the 5 groups do not superimpose onto the phosphate group of araUMP or 3CMP which binds at subsite P1 (parts c and d of Figure 7). Both 3CMP and araUMP exploit interactions with subsite P1 through their phosphate group which cannot be utilized by the pyrimidine compounds we studied, since they lack such a group. The weaker binding of our compounds compared to araUMP could be attributed to the phosphate interactions of araUMP with residues in subsite P1 which our compounds does not exploit. On the basis of the similar potency of our compound and 3CMP, it seems that the binding of the uracil or thymine to subsite B1 is stronger than the cytosine binding at this subsite. Although a comparison of kcat/Km values for cytidylyl and uridylyl substrates9,32 shows that the B1 site of RNase A has a small preference for cytosine over uracil, mutational studies by delCardayre and Raines39,40 have shown that the hydrogen bond between the pyrimidine N3 and Thr45 O1 in RNase A favors uracil over cytosine. The two key findings in these studies were as follows: (i) substitution of Ala for Asp83 decreases activity toward uridylyl nucleotides by 10-fold but barely affects cleavage of cytidylyl substrates and (ii) replacement of Thr45 by Gly in D83A-RNase lowers activity toward uridylyl and cytidylyl substrates similarly, by 11-fold and 6-fold, respectively. These results suggested that the observed hydrogen bond between Thr45 O1 and N3 of the pyrimidine ring is functionally important and that its strength is modulated by the additional interaction of the threonine side chain with O of Asp83. In the absence of Asp83, the hydrogen bonds with N3 of cytosine and uracil are nearly comparable in avidity; Asp83 selectively improves the interaction with uracil, probably by increasing the partial negative charge on Thr45 O1 and by aligning the hydroxyl appropriately. This preference together with the hydrogen-bond interactions of the 3-hydroxyl group of our compounds compensates for the hydrogen bond interactions between the 3-phosphate group of 3CMP and RNase A residues in subsite P1. U-2-p and U-3-p are more potent inhibitors of RNase A with Ki values of 7.1 and 82 µM, respectively,38 than the four uridine inhibitors presented in this study. Structural superposition of the four RNase A-uridine inhibitor complexes onto the U-2-p and U-3-p complexes reveals that the uridine moiety of

and U4S is bound away from the catalytic cleft toward the solvent. This results in the loss of the hydrogen interactions with His119 and a decrease in the potency of inhibitors U1S, U2S, U3S, and U4S. The structure of the RNase A-3Ne complex in RNase A revealed two inhibitor molecules bound in the central RNA binding cavity of RNase A exploiting interactions with residues from peripheral binding sites rather than from the active site of the enzyme.16 In the RNase A-3Ne complex, one of the inhibitor molecules is bound with its carboxylate group at subsite B1, and it was postulated that the carboxylate imitates the carbonyl groups of uracil.16 Structural superposition of our RNase A-inhibitor complexes onto the RNase A-3Ne complex (Figure 7b) shows that uracil or thymine superimposes onto the carboxylate group of one of the two 3Ne molecules in the active site. Unlike in the 3Ne complex none of the 5-group of ligands U1S-U4S, T3S, and T4S can imitate the carbonyl groups of uracil or thymine, and hence, the binding mode of these morpholino, piperidino, and pyrrolidino nucleotides follows a more rational pattern (i.e., the nucleotide base, uracil, or thymine binds at subsite B1 and the 3-hydroxyl group interacts with residues from subsite P1) in comparison to the 3Ne binding pattern. Structural superposition of each of the RNase A uridine or thymidine complexes onto the RNase A-pdUppA-3-p and the RNase A-pTppA-3-p complexes reveals that the uridine or thymidine part of the inhibitors superimposes onto the uridine part of pdUppA-3-p and the thymidine part of pTppA-3-p while the 5-morpholino, piperidino, or pyrrolidino group is close to

3. Conclusion A new class of non-natural 5-nucleotides has been identified as RNase A inhibitors. These compounds have a morpholino, piperidino, or pyrrolidino group at the 5-position and are moderate inhibitors of RNase A. The structural basis of their inhibition has been revealed by X-ray crystallography at high resolution. All inhibitor molecules bind to RNase A with their uridine or thymidine moiety in subsites B1R2, while the rest of the molecule projects to the solvent close to P0. This was not anticipated, since there is no obvious reason for why the binding of these inhibitors does not follow the binding pattern of similar pyrimidine nucleotides to place the 5 morpholino, piperidino, or pyrrolidino group at subsite P1, but instead it binds away from it. This observation shows that even small modifications of the inhibitor's chemical structure can generate profound alterations in its mode of interaction with the target protein. These findings also emphasize the importance of obtaining direct structural information on each new inhibitor complex on the optimization pathway. Structure assisted design for new inhibitors requires detailed knowledge of the protein-ligand interactions and a significant number of protein-ligand complex structures. Thus, any new structural data on complexes between RNase A and substrate analogues are of important use for a better understanding of inhibitor binding and enzyme catalytic mechanism. Comparative structural analysis of the RNase A in complex with U1S, U2S, U3S, U4S, T3S, and T4S, with other RNase A-ligand complexes (3Ne), suggests ways to improve their potency, and this study could be the starting point for the design of better inhibitors. Thus, we propose adding a suitably longer group at the 3-hydroxyl group of the ribose moiety of U1S, U2S, U3S, U4S, T3S, and T4S that can form additional interactions with residues at subsite B2, yielding a much more potent inhibitor. 4. Experimental Section
4.1. Chemistry. Materials and General Methods. Ethyl isonipecotate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and all other

reagents were from SRL India. Column chromatographic separations were done using silica gel (60-120 and 230-400 mesh). Solvents were dried and distilled following standard procedures. TLC was carried out on precoated plates (Merck silica gel 60, f254), and the spots were visualized with UV light or by charring the plates dipped in 5% H2SO4-MeOH solution or 5% H2SO4/vanillin/EtOH or 5% ninhydrin in MeOH solution. 1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were recorded on Bruker NMR instrument. All 1 H NMR in D2O were recorded using CH3CN as internal standard. All 13C NMR in D2O were recorded using DMSO-d6 as internal standard. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm,  scale). 5-Deoxy-5-N-(ethyl isonipecotatyl)uridine U1S. A mixture of 5-O-tosyl-2,3-O-isopropylidineuridine 141 (1.50 g, 3.42 mmol) and ethyl isonipecotate (12 mL) was heated at 60 °C. After 24 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and diluted with EtOAc (50 mL). The EtOAc solution was washed with water (3 × 20 mL), separated, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness and the solid residue was purified over a silica gel column to afford compound 2a (0.91 g, 63%). Compound 2a (0.20 g, 0.47 mmol) was stirred with 70% trifluoroacetic acid in water (5 mL) at room temperature. After 3 h, the solvent was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and coevaporated with ethanol (2 × 5 mL). The residue was purified over a silica gel column by using CHCl3 and MeOH solvent to obtain compound U1S (0.11 g, 57%).

(C) Inhibition Kinetics with RNase A. The inhibition of RNase A by compounds U1S-U4S, T3S, and T4S was assessed individually by a spectrophotometric method as described by Anderson and co-workers.38 The assay was performed in 0.1 M Mes-NaOH buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.1 M NaCl using 2,3-cCMP as the substrate. Experiments were repeated at least three times for each set. The inhibition constants (Ki) were determined from initial velocity data. The reciprocal of initial velocity was plotted against the inhibitor concentration (Dixon plot) according to the following equation:

concentration 0.67 mM) separately to a final volume of 100 µL, and the resulting solutions were incubated for 3 h. The 20 µL aliquots of the incubated mixtures were mixed with 20 µL of tRNA (5 mg/mL tRNA freshly dissolved in RNase free water) and incubated for another 30 min. Then 10 µL of sample buffer which consists of 10% glycerol and 0.025% bromophenol blue in RNase A free water was added to the mixture and 15 µL of it extracted and loaded onto a 1.1% agarose gel. The residual tRNA was visualized after ethidium bromide staining under UV light. (ii) Inhibition of RNase A by compounds U2S-U4S, T3S, and T4S were assayed qualitatively by the degradation of tRNA in a comparative agarose gel. In this method, 20 µL of RNase A (stock concentration 6.29 µM) was mixed with 80 µL of the compounds U2S-U4S, T3S, and T4S (stock concentration 0.17 mM) separately, and the resulting solutions were incubated for 3 h. Then gel was run according to the method described above, and the residual tRNA was visualized after ethidium bromide staining under UV light. (B) Precipitation Assay with RNase A. Inhibition of the ribonucleolytic activity of RNase A was quantified by the precipitation assay as described by Bond.45 In this method 10 µL of RNase A (stock concentration 11.04 µM) was mixed with 40 µL (stock concentration 0.80 mM) of compounds U1S-U4S, T3S, and T4S to a final volume of 100 µL and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. An amount of 20 µL of the resulting solutions from the incubated mixtures was then mixed with 40 µL of tRNA (5 mg/mL tRNA freshly dissolved in RNase A free water) and 40 µL of Tris-HCl buffer of pH 7.5 containing 5 mM EDTA and 0.5 mg/mL HSA. After incubation of the reaction mixture at 25 °C for 30 min, 200 µL of ice-cold 1.14 N perchloric acid containing 6 mM uranyl acetate was added to quench the reaction. The solution was then kept in ice for another 30 min and centrifuged at 4 °C at 12 000 rpm for 5 min. An amount of 50 µL of the supernatant was taken and diluted to 1 mL. The decrease in absorbance at 260 nm was measured and compared to that of a control set.

Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Refinement. Bovine pancreatic RNase A (type XII-A) and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Athens, Greece). Native crystals of RNase A grown in the monoclinic lattice C2 as described previously17 were soaked with compounds U1S, U2S, U3S, U4S, T3S, and T4S at a concentration of 80 mM in a buffered solution (20 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 25% PEG 4000) prior to data collection. Diffraction data were collected on station PX9.6 ( ) 0.92 Å) SRS, Daresbury, U.K., at 100 K, using a ADSC CCD detector. Data were processed using the HKL package,46 and intensities were transformed to amplitudes by the program TRUNCATE.47 Phases were obtained using the structure of free RNase A from monoclinic crystals at 100 K as starting model.16 Alternate cycles of manual building with the program COOT48 and refinement using the maximum likelihood target function as implemented in the program REFMAC49 improved the model. Inhibitor molecules were modeled using the Dundee PRODRG server (http:// davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/programs/prodrg/), and they were included in the refinement procedure during its final stages. A final round of TLS (translation/libration/screw) refinement within the program REFMAC49 using TLS groups for the protein generated by the TLSMD Web server50 improved considerably the final model. Details of data processing and refinement statistics are provided in Supporting Information. The program PROCHECK51 was used to assess the quality of the final structure. Analysis of the Ramachandran ( -) plot showed that all residues lie in the allowed regions. Solvent accessible areas were calculated with the program NACCESS.52 Figures were prepared with the program MOLSCRIPT53 or BOBSCRIPT54 and rendered with Raster3D.55
