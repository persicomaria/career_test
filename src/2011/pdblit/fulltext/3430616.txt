(Received 3 November 19R6) The bilin binding protein of the butterfly Pieris brassicae has been prepared, crystallized and its crystal structure determined at high resolution using film and FAST area detector intensity data. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains a tetramer of identical subunits with a molecular weight of about 90,000. The crystal structure was determined by isomorphous replacement. Use was made of the molecular symmetry to improve phases. A molecular interpretation of the electron density distribution and partial tracing of the polypeptide chain was possible without amino acid sequenceinformation, as the fold is very similar to retinol binding protein. It is characterized by a /?-barrel formed by two orthogonal P-sheets and an a-helix. The bilin pigment seemsto be bound within the p-barrel analogously to retinol in retinol binding protein. The tetramer in the crystal has C2 symmetry and is a dimer of dimers of quasi-equivalent subunits.

1. Introduction Bilin pigments, open-chain tetrapyrroles, are widely distributed in the insect orders, with considerable differences in the type or isomer of the bilin. Butterflies and moths have biliverdin 1x7, a blue-green pigment (for a review, seeKayser, 1985). Bilindiones are biosynthetically derived from porphyrins by oxidative opening of the macrocycle (for a review, see Kikuchi & Yoshida, 1980). The mechanism of heme degradation by a microsomal heme oxygenase system seems to be conserved in insects, mammals and cyanobacteria. Bilins are usually associated with proteins. The blue chromoprotein from the moth Manduca sexta has been purified and characterized (Cherbas, 1973; Goodman et al., 1985) sequenced (Riley et al., 1984) and c*rystallized (Petratos & Tsernoglou, 1987; Holden et al., 1986). Preliminary characterization of these crystals has been carried out. The protein is a trimer or tetramer of subunits with 189 amino acid 423

residues each. Each subunit is associated with a biliverdin pigment molecule. The protein from the butterfly Pieris brassicae (insect order Lepidoptera) has been partially characterized (Zipfel, 1982; Kayser & Zipfel, unpublished results). The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis indicates a close relation between the proteins from M. sexta and P. brassicae with about 60% identity in the first 60 residues (H. Deuzmann, unpublished results). The function of the insect biliproteins is unclear. They obviously contribute to the coloration, together with yellow carotenoid pigment protein complexes in particular, when deposited in the interlamellar space of the wings or in the epidermis. Biliverdins are also effective quenchers of oxygen radicals and may function in photoprotection, as do the carotenoids (McDonagh, 1979). It' has been suggested that biliverdin is involved in photoreception in P. brassicae (Vuillaume & Dattee, 1980). It is quite remarkable that large quantities of

et al. photographs showed symmetry and systematic absences in accord with space group P2,2,2. The cell dimensions are a = 132.7 A, b = 121.9 A, c = 63.9 8. 6' = 1.034 x lo6 A3. The volume of the unit cell suggests 3 or 4 protomers of molecular weight 20,000 in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to packing densities of 4.02 and 3.02 A3/dalton, respectively. The crystal structure analysis shows that a tetramer forms the asymmetric unit. X-ray intensity data were collected by film methods and with the FAST television area detector. Film data collection was with rotation camera (Huber, Rimsting and Enraf Nonius, Delft) using graphite monochromatized CuKcr radiation from a Rigaku Denki Ru200 rotating anode generator, operated at 4.5 kW and with an apparent focal spot size of 0.3 mm x 0.3 mm in a cold room at -3°C. The cameras had a crystal to film distance of 6.5 cm. The crystal to focus distance was 30 cm. The rotation range was usually 1" to 1.5". Three films (Kodak, DEF-2) in a pack were exposed for about 8 h. The diffraction photographs were densitometered on an Optronics drum film scanner P and evaluation with the FILME program system (Schwager et al., 1975, as modified by W. S. Bennett). Film data were collected from 3 crystals of native material to high resolution by rotation around the b axis (92" range of rotation) and from 1 crystal by rotation about the bc diagonal (18" range of rotation). The FAST television area detector (Enraf Nonius, Delft) was operated with a conventional X-ray generator and an AEG microfocus tube with Cu anode run at 0.8 kW with an apparent focal spot size of 0.1 mm x 0.1 mm. The diffractometer is located in a hood, which is cooled to about 10°C by a stream of cold air (2 to 3"C), with a diameter of about 10 cm, directed towards the crystal. By this arrangement, the capillary in which the crystal is sealed is at a constant temperature of 2 to 3°C over its entire length. The diffractometer is interfaced to a VAX 1 l/725 computer. The data were evaluated on-line using the program system MADNES (Pflugrath & Messerschmidt. 1986). This program system also allows determination and refinement' of crystal setting parameters. crystal crll constants and camera parameters. These constants are initially determined by scanning 2 slices of the reciprocal lattice that are 90" apart. The crystal setting parameters are thereafter continuously updated during the intensity data collection on the basis of the observed positions of t,he reflections evaluated. Frames had a width of 0.1" and were taken in 100 s. MADNES has a number of opt,ions concerning the procedure of intensity evaluation. which were tested and used for the measurement of native and heavy-atom derivative data reported in Table 1. The procedure used now routinely shall be described briefly. It is based on the dynamic mask technique of Sjiilin & Wlodawer (1981). The 3-dimensional boxes of raw intensity data (x, y detector plane co-ordinates. and a,crystal rotation) were smoothed and the size of a mask defined. The mask assigns the raw data into peak. background and neither peak nor background pixels. The mask parameters are determined for 16 different areas into which the detector plane is divided and updated during the course of crystal rotation. Systemat,ir shifts of the centre of gravity of strong reflections from the calculated positions in the 16 areas of the detector plane are followed and updated during crystal rotation and applied to weaker reflections. For weak reflections, t'he masks determined from medium and strong reflections from the same area of the detector are used. Background due to dark current and electronic noise of

biliverdin accumulate in many insect species that lack hemoglobin. Heme functions solely as an intermediate in biliverdin synthesis here. The synthesis of insect biliproteins in the epidermis is dependent on the developmental state and regulated by hormones (Kayser, 1984; Kayser & Krull-Savage, 1984; Goodman et al., 1985). Biliverdins are rather insoluble at neutral pH, so that the association with protein may be required for transport. Our interest in the insect biliprotein arose from studies of cyanobacterial biliproteins, components of the light-harvesting organelles of these bacteria. We aim at an understanding of the spectroscopic and functional properties of these protein pigment complexes, which have biliverdin IXa covalently bound (Schirmer et al., 1985, 1986). It is clear that configuration and conformation as well as environinfluence the spectroscopic ment profoundly properties of bilin pigments (Falk, 1985), so that an analysis of the structure of an insect biliprotein broadens the experimental basis for understanding these properties. It also adds to our understanding
of the biological role of these protein pigment,

complexes.
In this paper, we describe crystallization. crystallographic analysis and preliminary molecular model of the bilin binding protein from Pieris brassicae.

2. Materials and Methods
The biliprotein was prepared according to the procedure of Zipfel (1982). The BBPf used for crystallographic work represents the main biliprotein (fraction I, -900/b) of P. brassicae. BBP was isolated from whole butterflies on a large scale, as outlined below. An extract was made with 0.2 M-potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) and cleared by a short heat treatment (55"C, 2 min). BBP was precipitated with ammonium sulphate at 65% to 85% saturation (2O"C), passed over a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 0.025 M-imidazole . HCl (pH 7.4), and concentrated by ultrafiltration. The proteins were fractionated by chromatofocusing on a PBE 94 column (Pharmacia) with polybuffer 74 (Pharmacia) adjusted to pH 5.0. The purity of biliprotrin fractions was determined by spectrophotometry at 383 nm and 280 nm. Concentration of pure fract,ions and removal of polybuffer was performed on a column of phenyl-Sepharose equilibrated with 6Ooi, saturated ammonium sulphate. BBP was eluted with water, further concentrated by ultrafiltration, and finally lyophilized. Details of the purification and physicochemical properties of BBP will be reported elsewhere. Pieris BBP was crystallized by vapour diffusion according to the following procedure. A droplet of 5 ~1 of a solution of 20 mg protein in 1 ml water was mixed with 1 ~1 of buffer (2.8 M-ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M-imidazole, pH 7) and concentrated over the same buffer. Crystallization in large prismatic crystals occurred within about a week in the cold room. The crystals were harvested and transferred into the same buffer.

the detector system is determined by images with the shutter closed and subtracted pixel by pixel from the assigned peak and background values. Dark current images are measured in intervals of about 5 h, but found to be rather constant. The correction for non-uniformity of detector response is applied pixel by pixel to the data. The non-uniformity is determined by measuring unobstructed radiation from the X-ray tube as a source of uniform radiation over the surface of the detector. Spatial distortion of the detector is measured similarly with a metal grid placed in front of the detector. Both corrections were found constant over the period of nearly 2 years the diffractometer was in use. The measured intensity data were divided into batches of 2.5" width of crystal rotation and were loaded, scaled, and merged by programs of the PROTEIN system (Steigemann, 1974). Heavy-atom derivatives were prepared by soaking the crystals in solutions of the following compounds: HG,JO: 5 mg K2H,I,/ml in 2.7 M-ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M-imidazole, pH 7 for 6 days PTCN: 7.4 mg K,Pt(CN),/ml in the same buffer for 4 days AUCL: 3.7 mg KAuCl,/ml in the same buffer for 5 days PTCL: 5.2 mg K,PtCl,/ml in the same buffer for 10 days. The derivatives were analysed by routines of the PROTEIN program system, which included a vector search procedure of self and cross-vectors of potential heavy-atom sites. These sites were correlated between the different derivatives and confirmed by phase calculation and difference Fourier methods. Heavy-atom parameters were refined by a least-squares method. The absolute configuration of the derivatives was indicated by the correlation coefficients between signs of the amplitude measured and calculated differences of Friedel pairs of reflections for the various derivatives. Local symmetry elements were analysed in the Patterson function with the rotation function operating in direct space (Huber, 1969) as implemented in the PROTEIN program system. In a later stage, orientations and positions of the local dyad axis of symmetry (relating subunits A and B with C and D) and the general rotation axes (relating A with B and C with D; respectively) were determined and refined as follows. The electron density corresponding to a tetrameric molecule was isolated by a mask using programs of G. Remington for a Genisco raster display and transported in a cubic unit cell using programs of Bricogne (1976). It was Fourier transformed and a Patterson map calculated. A rotation function allowed to determine the rotational symmetry operator within the molecule. The t#ranslational components were determined by selecting maxima from the molecular electron density; these were transformed by the rotational symmetry operation determined above and scanned in the molecular electron density in the 3 directions until optimal superposition was found using the SEARCH routines of the PROTEIN program system. Solvent, flattening was applied following the procedure of Wang (1985) with programs by M. Schneider to determine the molecular boundary. It was performed in cycles consisting of electron density calculation, solvent flattening, Fourier transformation, combination of calculated phases with phases from isomorphous replacement and electron density calculation. Phases were combined weighting the calculated phases and isomorphous phases

according to Sim (1959) and the figure of merit, respectively. The final electron density map was averaged applying the molecular dyad that relates A and B to C and D. Averaging was performed in cycles consisting of electron density calculation, averaging, Fourier transformation, combination of calculated phases with phases after solvent flattening, and electron density calculation. The phase combination step was omitted in the last cycles. The programe system of Bricogne (1976) was used for the averaging operation. All other operations were performed with the PROTEIN program system. Atomic models were built and model comparisons performed on a PS300 Evans and Sutherland graphics system with the program system FRODO (Jones, 1978). Subunit A was transformed to generate subunit) B, whose positions was refined by optimal fitting into the electron density map applying the SEARCH routines. A partial model of the tetramer was used to improve phases by a weighted combination of calculated phases with the final phases after solvent flattening and cyclic averaging. Comparison of amino acid sequences of BBP biliprotein with retinol binding protein (RBP) was performed with the program system iiLIGN (Orcutt et al.. 1982).

3. Results and Discussion
(a)

Data collection

A summary of the results of intensity data collection is presented in Table 1. Intensity data were collected for native crystals by film methods on rotation cameras. Significant data at the one standard deviation (s u.) level comprise 76% of the theoretically possible intensities to 2-Ow resolution. In the outermost shell from 2.03 to 2.0 A, 32% were measured. The quality of the data is satisfactory, as indicated by the merging R-values of 5 to 8% on the basis of intensities. Partially recorded reflections were evaluated. The quality of these is only slightly worse compared to fully recorded reflections, as shown by column 9 in Table 1, where merging R-values of all measurements are compared with those of fully recorded reflections. The search of heavy-atom derivatives and data collection was done with the FAST television area detector. A distance of 6 cm between crystal and detector plane was required for sufficient resolution of the diffraction spots. I:nder these conditions, and with symmetrical detector setting, the rectangular aperture of the detector limits reflections to 3.5 a and 4.0 L%in the vert'ical and horizontal directions, respectively. The FAST data are complete at the 2.5 s.T). level to about 7096 to 3.5 A resolution. In the outermost shell (3.56 to 3.5 A), about 30 to 40% of all possible data have been measured. Completeness to 4 A resolution where diffractometer and detector setting allows full recording is around S5o/o. Apparently, film data are more complete. There are three reasons to account for this. (1) Film data were collected with a stronger and monochromatized

(2) The and evaluation of intensities, background, estimated errors differs in the FILME program and in MADNES and quite generally yields rather low estimated errors in FILME. (3) Film and FAST data were rejected at different levels of standard deviation, 1.0 and 24 s.D., respectively. The diffraction experiments for film and FAST data collection were performed in the cold, at -3 and 2"C, respectively. The lifetime of the crystals in the X-ray beam was 200 to 300 hours on the rotation camera until deterioration could be detected. In the FAST experiment, total exposure times were about 30 hours and no deterioration during this time was observed. The crystal structure of BBP was solved on the basis of FAST data for native and derivative crystals alone. The high-resolution film data served and serve for structure refinement. (b) Zsomorphous
replacement

In a preliminary search for heavy-atom derivatives, the stability of small crystal fragments was tested under the microscope. It was found that a large number of heavy-metal compounds caused decolorization of the crystals, which eventually

dissolved, probably indicating removal of the bilin pigment. Five derivatives were measured, as noted in Table 1. It was found that all produced substantial diffraction intensity changes, but AUCN was not interpretable even in difference Fourier maps calculated in later stages and PTCL was nearly useless. The interpretation of the HGJO derivative difference Patterson map by a vector search procedure was straightforward. The highest maxima in the search for self-vectors were confirmed by searches for cross-vectors between them and by difference Fourier methods using phases calculated from this single derivative. The AUCL derivative had a somewhat less clear difference Patterson map but was interpretable by the combined use of vector search procedures and difference Fourier methods. The PTCN derivative was solved by difference Fourier methods based on phases from HGJO and AUCL. No attempt was made to resolve Hg and I atoms in the HGJO compound. We believe that the anisotropic temperature factor refinement is able to model the anisotropic (HgI,)2 - adequately at this resolution. Refinement of heavy-atom positions and thermal parameters proceeded by a least-squares refinement minimizing the lack of closure. The phasing power indicated by the relation of heavy-atom contributions and residual is weak, in particular at high

(c) Solvent $attening A Fourier map calculated with the isomorphous phases determined above showed the molecular boundary and indicated a tetramer of the 20,000 M, subunits in the asymmetric unit. The molecular boundary was determined assuming a value of 40% of the cell volume occupied by protein. The solvent area was set to zero and the modified electron density Fourier transformed. The calculated phases were combined with the phases from isomorphous replacement and a Fourier map calculated (Table 3), five cycles comprising these four steps were performed, cycles 1 and 2 at 4A resolution, cycles 3 and 5 at 3.5 A resolution. The R-value comparing observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes decreased to 0.26. The figure of merit increased to 0.8 and the phase difference between combined phases and calculated phases decreased from about 18" to 13" during these cycles.

The final electron density map at 3.5 A resolution showed a very clear molecular boundary as expected, but also had many features recognizable as polypeptide strands associated in sheets as well as a single a-helix.

Dyad 1 was then refined by alternate orientational and translational correlations in the Fourier map, whose resolution was extended to 4A (Table 4, 1st entry). After the molecular interpretation of the electron density map, it became clear that dyad 3 does not intersect dyad 1, and dyad 2 has a large screw component. Therefore, dyad 1 is valid for the entire tetramer, while dyads 2 and 3 relate dimers within the tetramer only. This explains the lower correlations of dyads 2 and 3 in the rotation function, and the lack of a significant correlation in the Fourier map. The A to B and B to D symmetry relations reported in Table 4 were obtained by fitting a preliminary model of subunit A to the electron densities corresponding to subunits B and D, respectively, by alternate orientational and translational correlations in the Fourier map. The A and B to C and D operation represents a perfect dyad axis of symmetry (operation 1) roughly in the direction of the ab diagonal of the crystal cell and tilted about 13" out of the ab plane. The B to D and A to C operations (operation 3) correspond also to exact dyads, which have a very small screw component and are nearly perpendicular to dyad 1 but do not intersect it. The A to B and D to C operations have 172.5" rotations and large screw components of 7 A. The consecutive searches in the Patterson and Fourier maps provide an efficient means to separate orientational and translational components of the local symmetry operator. Symmetry operation 1 is reflected in some heavyatom positions (PTCN2-PTCNS) (AUCLI-AUCL5) (AUCL2-AUCL6). The various transformations are summarized in Table 4. They refer to tetramer 1, whose centre of gravity is located at 33.7, 34.5, 53.1 (A). The arrangements of subunits A to D is shown in Figure 4. Symmetry operation 1 was used in cyclic averaging.

the basis for the analysis of the symmetry relation between the protomers used for the cyclic averaging procedure. (d) Symmetry relations

The exact symmetry relations between the protomers in the tetramer were determined by superposition of equivalent electron densities. An envelope enclosing a tetramer was generated and the mask and the electron density contained therein transported into a cubic cell with a cell length of 120 A. This molecular electron density was Fourier transformed and a Patterson function at 5 A resolution calculated, whose symmetry was explored by a two-dimensional rotation function in direct' space at x = 180" corresponding to 2-fold axes: 5735 peaks were selected in a shell between 5 and 30 A from the origin of the Patterson function. The correlation yielded three peaks with heights of 49.8% (operation l), 39.9% (operation 2) and 33.8% (operation 3) of the identity operation at polar angles cp+$,rct 40",194",180"; 90",102",180"; 52",10",180". The mean value of the function was 16.9. These solutions indicate three approximately perpendicular dyad axes of symmetry. Limited three-dimensional scans showed that the maxima were at k = 180". It is quite obvious that dyad 1 is obeyed better than dyads 2 and 3. The translation components of the rotation operations were searched in the Fourier map of the crystal ceil by selecting 2101 maxima from the electron density corresponding to a tetramer within a radius of 30 A from the approximate origin of the tetramer. These maxima, after application of the rotational local symmetry operator, were scanned in a limited region that had been selected by visual examination of equivalent parts in the Fourier map. Operation 1 yielded a high and sharp maximum

P. brassicae Bilin (e) Averaging The electron density obtained after solvent flattening was averaged within the envelope of one tetramic molecule using symmetry operation 1. From the averaged density, a unit cell was generated applying the space group symmetry operations, and Fourier transformed. The resulting phases were combined with the phases obtained after solvent flattening. A Fourier map with these phases and the observed structure factor amplitudes was calculated and averaged. This cycle was performed twice. Three cycles followed without phase combination. Table 3 summarizes the results. The R-value comparing observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes decreased from 0.30 to 0.22. The final electron density map was the basis of the initial model interpretation. The fourfold repetition of the structural motif in the asymmetric unit would have allowed fourfold averaging by choosing an envelope enclosing one subunit and the symmetry operations relating the individual subunits. As these are partly improper syrnmetry operat'ions, the procedure is slightly more complex. We were already satisfied by the result of the averaging about the molecular dyad and omitted this step. (f ) Model interpretation The arrangement of B-sheets of polypeptide strands and a single a-helix within the subunits suggested a close similarity in structure to retinol binding protein (Newcomer et al., 1984). A quantitative fit of RBP to the electron density of subunit A was made by superimposing equivalent atoms selected upon visual inspection. In a second step, polypeptide strands of RBP were quantitatively correlated with the electron density, allowing small rotations and translations to find the highest correlation value. The fitted RPB model served as a guideline to interpret the electron density of subunit A in terms of polypeptide main chain. Partial tracing of the amino acid sequence was possible on the basis of the preliminary amino acid sequence of the N-terminal region of the P. bras&cue protein (Deuzmann, unpublished results) and the amino acid sequence of the related M. sexta protein (Riley et al., 1984).

This partial model of subunit A was transformed to fit the density of subunit B by quantitative correlation with the electron density using C" carbon positions. Subunits C and D were generated by applying symmetry operation 1. A summary of these transformations is given in Table 4. The correlation of model B obtained by transformation from subunit A with its associated electron density is 80% of that of model A, demonstrating a very close similarity of the subunits in the tetramer. The model contained essentially main-chain atoms of the well-defined B-sheet regions and the cc-helix. It comprised about one half of the atoms of the tetramer. Structure factors were calculated from this model to 3.0 A resolution and phases combined with the phases obtained after solvent flattening to 3.5 A resolution. The Fourier map at 3.0 A resolution was averaged by symmetry operation 1, Fourier transformed and these operations repeated three times. Table 5 summarizes the results. It is worth noting that the final R-value of cyclic averaging at 3.0 A resolution was 0.24. This is close to the value at 3.5 A resolution before model incorporation, indicating that symmetry operation 1 is valid to high resolution. The resulting Fourier map was indeed considerably improved in resolution and interpretability of parts not used for phase calculation. It allowed the identification of the first 60 residues of the P. bras&cue amino acid sequence. The related M. sexta sequence fitted reasonably well to the rest of the molecule concerning the disulphide linkages, many aromatic side-chains, and the arrangement of polar and apolar residues (see note added in proof). A nearly complete model of the polypeptide main chain was built from residue 9 to 175. In addition, many amino acid side-chains identified by their conspicuous electron density were incorporated. This preliminary model forms the basis of the structural interpretation given below. It must be regarded as tentative until the amino acid sequence has been determined and incorporated into the crystal structure and refined. (g) Molecular structure

The molecular structure is characterized by an up and down /I-barrel of eight antiparallel P-strands.

chain fold of BBP showing the 2 perpendicular b-sheets. The amino acid numbers correspond but must be regarded as tentative, as the polypeptide chain has not been completely correlated

The b-barrel is arranged in two stacked orthogonal P-sheets (Fig. 1). P-sheet 1, in front of Figure 1, consists of strands 165-168, 30-33, 130-136, 112117 and 102-109; B-sheet 2 consists of strands 2428, 43-52, 55-63, 67-77, 87-94 and 97-102. Segments 24-33 and 97-109 are shared by both B-sheets. A short N-terminal a-helix is formed by residues 20 to 23. The longer C-terminal cl-helix is made up from residues 144 to 155. It leans against B-sheet 1. Defined electron density ends with Cys175 linked to Cys43 of B-sheet 2. In the N-terminal segment, the electron density is defined from Cys9, which forms a disulphide link to Cysll9, which is located in a turn of strands of p-sheet 1. The strands of the B-barrel are wrapped around the surface of a cone, which is widely open at one end and closed at the other (Fig. 2). There is electron density not accounted for by the protein inside the cone, which probably represents the bound bilin pigment. It is in contact with a

number of aromatic and also polar residues of the protein. We have not attempted to interpret this electron density in detail, but postpone model building until completion and refinement of the crystal structure analysis (see note added in proof). (h) Subunit
association

The iV. sexta BBP is oligomeric. Molecular weight determinations suggested trimers (Goodman et al., 1985) or, supported by a variety of experimental data, tetramers (Riley et al., 1984). In the P. brussicae BBP so far only monomers have been observed in solution but the crystals contain tetramers with closely associated subunits. The tetramer is a dimer of quasi-equivalent dimers and has C2 symmetry. The molecular dyad (operation 1) relates subunits A and B with C and D. Subunits A and B and C and D, respectively, are related by non-intersecting rotation axes that have a rotation of 172" and screw components of about

7 A (operations 2' and 2 in Table 4 and Fig. 4). The heterologous contact between A and B and C and D, respectively, is through residues 143 to 169, comprising the C-terminal cc-helix and the following segment. B and C, related by the molecular dyad are in isologous contact via residues 159 to 164, while A and D, related by the same symmetry operation, and far removed from each other. There is little contact between A and C, and B and D, respectively, which are related by dyads (operations 3 and 3'). The subunit association in the tetramer is obviously determined by a balance of contacts made from the four C-terminal cr-helices and adjacent strands, which participate in all contacts. These segments do not pair in an isologous fashion with D2 symmetry but as dimers of dimers with C2 symmetry only. The B-C contact absent in A and D is the main source of inequivalence of subunits A and B, and C and D, respectively. Structural differences of the quasi-equivalent subunits are very small, as shown by the very close correspondence of subunits A and B. It will require careful refinement to define them.

It is unclear whether the Pieris BBP tetramer in solution is a dimer of dimers, as in the crystals, or a symmetrical tetramer. In a symmetrical tetramer, the C-terminal segments would have to pack very differently in the centre of the molecule. This might be energetically disfavoured. Alternatively, crystal packing could cause deformation of a symmetrical tetramer. We will explore this question in detail at a later stage when a complete model and sequence is available. Figure 4 is a view of the tetramer along the molecular dyad. It shows clearly the dyads relating A and C, and B and D, respectively, and the screw axes relating A and B, and C and D, respectively, which do not intersect. (i) Crystal packing The four tetramers in the crystal are located ;n the space between the set of crystallographic dyads along c. There is weak contact between molecules in the ab plane, but tight packing in columns along c, which might exert strain on the tetramer and be responsible for the lower C2 symmetry.

(j) Comparison

of Pieris BBP

and RBP

structures

BBP and RBP have a very similar fold, as shown by Figures 1 and 3. The central parts of b-sheets 1 and 2 and the C-terminal a-helix can be superimposed almost exactly. There are large deviations in external loop regions. Retinol and, most likely, biliverdin are located in equivalent sites inside the cone-shaped p-barrel of the protein. The detailed interactions, however, between ligand and protein are likely to be rather different in view of the chemical and structural differences of the two ligands. The mutual structural similarity between P-lactoglobulin and RBP (Sawyer et al., 1985; Papiz et al., 1986) suggests also similarity to Pieris BBP. This is indeed obvious from a comparison of stereo drawings, a detailed analysis is yet to be made, however. (k) Comparison
of BBP and RBP acid sequences
amino

The amino acid sequencesof BBP from M. sexta (Riley et al., 1984) and RBP (Rask et al., 1979) were aligned and compared with the program system ALIGN (Orcutt et al., 1982). The score for the matching residues was defined by the Mutation Data Matrix with 10 added to each value. A penalty of 10 was assigned to a break. The best alignment had a score 95 higher than the mean score of randomized sequence corresponding to 4.5 S.D. This indicates marginally significant homology and is insufficient evidence for structural similarity, in contrast to the very high degree of structural relatedness observed. Parts of the sequence that show the highest homology (around residues 18 to 50, and 105 to 120, BBP sequence numbering) are indeed structurally equivalent. A sequence homology between RBP and fl-lacto-

blobulin has been recognized (Pervaiz & Brew, 1985) and can now be extended to BBP. A preliminary alignment of BBP and ZUactoglobulin shares the most homologous segments with RBP. Table 6 was composed from the pairwise alignment of the sequences of BBP with RBP and p-lactoglobulin, respectively. It has not been matched with the three-dimensional structures in detail. This will be done when the BBP crystal structure analysis is completed. It will then be possible to define accurately the gaps introduced in the sequences.RBP and j?-lactoglobulin were found to have amino acid sequence homology to an a,-glycoprotein (HC) of unknown function from human urine (Pervaiz & Brew, 1985; Ekstrom et al., 1975; Teiler & Grubb, 1976; Takagi et al., 1981; Lopez et aZ., 1981). HC is obviously homologous also to BBP. Its yellowish-brown colour suggests the presence of a pigment that has not been chemically identified. It was speculated that it may be a retiniod (Pervaiz & Brew, 1985). On the basis of the relation of HC to BBP, bile pigments of porphyrins should also be considered. (1) Pieris BBP
function

Mammalian plasma retinol binding protein seems to serve as a carrier of the water-insoluble retinol from its site of synthesis in the liver to the peripheral tissues. The control of retinol release from the liver and directed delivery to retinolrequiring cells seems to occur via RBP synthesis and secretion (for a review, see Goodman, 1984). RBP circulates in plasma as a complex with prealbumin (transthyretin), possibly to prevent glomerular filtration and renal catabolism. Pieris BBP is very similar in structure to mammalian RBP, and probably serves as a carrier

protein for biliverdin. It may have similar control functions for biliverdin synthesis and delivery as RBP has for retinol. As with RBP, BBP biosynthesis is highly regulated. The similarity of their carrier proteins might point to common functional properties of retinoids and biliverdins. Retinoids are visual pigments and biliverdins may indeed be involved in photoreception in insects (Vuillaume & Dattee, 1980). Insects also have substantial amounts of carotenoid protein complexes, which may be related to BBP and represent the link to mammalian RBP. The RBP structural motif seems to be particularly suited for the construction of proteins to act as a bag for chemically quite diverse ligands. We are grateful for the financial contribution of the Sonderforschungsbereich 143. Dr T. A. Jones helped us by providing the RBP model co-ordinates; he also made important suggestions concerning the model comparisons.
