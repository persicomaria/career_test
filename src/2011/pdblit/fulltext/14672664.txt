Toxin­antitoxin systems are highly abundant in plasmids and bacterial chromosomes. They ensure plasmid maintenance by killing bacteria that have lost the plasmid. Their expression is autoregulated at the level of transcription. Here, we present the solution structure of CcdA, the antitoxin of the ccd system, as a free protein (16.7 kDa) and in complex with its cognate DNA (25.3 kDa). CcdA is composed of two distinct and independent domains: the N-terminal domain, responsible for DNA binding, which establishes a new family of the ribbon-helix-helix fold and the C-terminal region, which is responsible for the interaction with the toxin CcdB. The C-terminal domain is intrinsically unstructured and forms a tight complex with the toxin. We show that CcdA specifically recognizes a 6 bp palindromic DNA sequence within the operator­promoter (OP) region of the ccd operon and binds to DNA by insertion of the positively charged Nterminal -sheet into the major groove. The binding of up to three CcdA dimers to a 33mer DNA of its operator­promoter region was studied by NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry and single point mutation. The highly flexible C-terminal region of free CcdA explains its susceptibility to proteolysis by the Lon ATP-dependent protease.

Introduction
Toxin­antitoxin (TA; also called poison-antidote systems or plasmid addiction systems) modules are highly abundant in bacterial plasmids and chromosomes.1 They participate in plasmid stabilization through the expression of two small proteins: a stable toxin and a short-lived antitoxin and form a short operon whose transcription is autoregulated.

Plasmidic TA modules contribute to the stability of these mobile genetic elements in the growing host bacterial population by killing daughter cells that have not inherited a plasmid copy (post-segregational killing mechanism, PSK). Upon plasmid loss, de novo synthesis of the plasmid-encoded TA pair ceases and, as a result of antitoxin degradation, the toxin is liberated and causes cell death. A growing number of such TA modules have been found to be encoded on various plasmids (e.g. ccd, parDE, phd/ doc, kis/kid, pemI/K, pasABC, hig, , yefM/yoeB). Since TA modules are also found in bacterial chromosomes,1,2 including pathogenic ones (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae), and archaea (e.g. relBE, mazEF)1,3 their function is still under debate. It has been hypothesized that chromosomal TA modules help bacteria to deal with nutritional stress by adjusting the rates of protein and DNA synthesis via down-regulation of translation and replication.1 Alternatively, they might induce programmed cell death when it becomes beneficial to the community to sacrifice a portion of the popu-

171 properties of CcdA after heat-denaturation in a modified purification protocol. Correct folding of CcdAR70K obtained by this heat treatment was verified by short 2D 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) data compared to a freshly made sample without heating. Identical folding of heat-stabilized CcdA and CcdAR70K was ascertained with 2D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra. Therefore, from now on we will refer to CcdAR70K as CcdA. The purity of a freshly made sample of CcdA was established by SDS­PAGE and analytical gel-filtration chromatography. The amino acid sequence of CcdA is shown in Figure 1(a). The 2D 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of double-labeled CcdA shows mainly well-dispersed signals (Figure 1(b), black contours). This indicates that the protein is well folded, at least within certain regions. Surprisingly, the number of NH-resonances of a highly purified sample of CcdA was found to be larger than the number of amino acid residues, pointing to the presence of multiple conformations. The separate sets of resonances observed for each of the conformers also indicate that they interconvert slowly. Sequential backbone and side-chain assignments localized the well-dispersed signals to residues 3­40. Values closer to random coil shifts were observed for the C-terminal 30 residues, together with three different conformations (labeled "a", "b" and "c" in Figure 1(b) and (c)). These provide evidence that CcdA consists of two domains, a structured N terminus (CcdAN; Gln3­Arg40) and a much more flexible C terminus (CcdAC; Ala41­ Trp72) which adopts different, partially stable conformations. Two of these conformations (labeled "a" and "c" in Figure 1(b)) show shifts close to random coil values and are flexible or disordered within the C terminus. Since conformers "a" and "c" are characterized by different chemical shifts there must be some residual structure in the Cterminal region of at least one of them. However, this partial structure is not stable enough to be amenable for a structure determination by NMR. Proline cis-trans isomerization can be excluded based on the complete absence of proline residues in CcdA (see Figure 1(a)). One conformation (labeled "b" in Figure 1(b)) gives resonances more typical for a structured protein. Based on integrated signal intensities in 2D 15N-1H HSQC spectra, the relative amounts of conformers "a", "b", and "c" are 45%, 45% and 10%, respectively. However, these ratios should to be interpreted with caution, since different relaxation properties of these conformers limit a direct relationship between peak intensity and conformer population. Upon heating up to 55 °C signals from conformer "a" and "c" merged, but resonances of conformer "b" stay almost unchanged. The limited stability of CcdA samples at temperatures above 55 °C prohibited the investigation of possible conformational exchange at higher temperatures by NMR. The relative amounts of each conformer did not change up to 55 °C based on HSQC peak intensities.

lation.4 TA modules are a major factor contributing to the persistence of antibiotic resistance and virulence in bacteria. 5 Therefore, TA modules might constitute a novel class of antimicrobial drug targets. Apart from the importance of these modules for plasmid and bacterial physiology, TA modules also play an increasing role for biotechnological applications to stabilize autonomously replicating vectors used in recombinant bacteria.6,7 The ccd (control cell death) system of the Escherichia coli F plasmid was discovered as the first TA module. The co-expressed gene products encoded in the ccd operon are the unstable antitoxin CcdA (72 amino acid residues) which is degraded by the Lon ATP-dependent protease and the CcdB toxin (101 amino acid residues). CcdB targets the DNA gyrase, an essential type II topoisomerase. Both form homodimers in solution.8,9 CcdA is a bi-functional protein whose major functions are: toxin antagonizing and autorepression. Under normal growth conditions the antitoxin CcdA inhibits the toxic activity of CcdB by forming a tight CcdA2­(CcdB2)2 complex.10 Once a bacterium loses its plasmid, the short-lived CcdA is not replenished by de novo synthesis leaving the long-lived toxin unopposed in the cytoplasm.11 As a result, CcdB traps DNA­ gyrase complexes and mediates cell death.12 The ccd system is negatively autoregulated at the level of transcription by binding of a CcdA2-CcdB2 complex to the operator­promoter (OP) region of the operon.13-16 Structural data on TA modules are just beginning to emerge. Besides CcdB, structural data are available for the structurally related toxin Kid, several toxin­antitoxin complexes (22,17 MazE2MazF418 RelE2-RelB2,19 YoeB2YefM420) as well as the antitoxin MazE bound to a camel antibody.21 However, no 3D structure of free antitoxins or antitoxin­DNA complexes has been reported. Here, we present the structure of the CcdA antitoxin in a free state and in complex with its cognate DNA. We are able to show that CcdA consists of two structural modules: the Nterminal domain (CcdAN), which is responsible for DNA binding forms a well-structured ribbon-helixhelix (RHH) fold and the C-terminal region, which binds to CcdB is highly flexible in the unbound state. The C terminus (CcdAC) becomes structured upon toxin binding. The antitoxin­DNA interaction is described by the solution structure of CcdA bound to a 12 bp OP­DNA stretch comprising a 6 bp palindromic sequence.

The backbone NHs are labeled according to their sequence number and amino acid. Three sets of signals observed for some residues in the C-terminal regions belonging to the three different conformers are labeled "a", "b" and "c". Most likely due to intermediately fast dynamics, certain resonances for the C-terminal region could not be detected for all three confomers, (conformer "a": Arg43­ Val46 and Val53; conformer "b": Arg43­Met52, Ile59­Phe65, Glu68­ Trp72, conformer "c": Arg43­Val55, Arg57­Phe58, Met61­Asn62, Ala66­ Trp72). (c) Specific peak shifts due to DNA binding, especially from the N-terminal region are displayed in the enlarged spectra.

The solution structure of CcdA free and bound to DNA was determined using nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs), dihedral angles and residual dipolar couplings. Intermonomer (within the dimer) NOEs were obtained on a sample of 15N/13C-labeled CcdA mixed 1:1 with unlabeled CcdA (see Materials and Methods for details). Structural statistics for CcdA are displayed in Table 1. CcdAN consists of two subunits; each comprises a -strand followed by two -helices, connected by short loop regions (Figure 2). Its topology and DNA-binding characteristics classify CcdAN as a member of the ribbonhelix-helix fold.22-28 An intermonomer antiparallel -sheet is formed by residues Arg4 to Thr8 and Arg4 to Thr8 (primed residues refer to the second monomer in the homodimeric structure). A loop region from Asp10 to Ser13 connects the -strand with -helix 1 (Tyr14­Tyr20). A second loop from Asp21 to Ile24 leads into -helix 2 (Ser25­Arg38). The hydrophobic core is formed by apolar residues from both monomers, in particular from the strands (Ile5 and Val7) and the -helices (Tyr14, Leu17, Ile24, Val28 and Met32). Strong intermolecular NOEs between 2/2 (e.g. Val28­Met32,

Thr31­Thr31) and between 1/1 and 2/2 (e.g. Tyr20­Leu39) fix the relative arrangement of the helices. CcdAC of conformer "a" is very flexible, showing only trivial and short-range NOEs. In contrast, in conformer "b" strong NOEs (Ala66 and Asp67 to Tyr20, Leu39, Val22) show that these C-terminal residues fold back onto CcdAN and bury hydrophobic side-chains (Figure 2(c)). Removal of this back-fold by deletion of the 11 C-terminal residues in the CcdA-11 mutant significantly destabilized the antitoxin. Only minor amounts of CcdA-11 were detectable by Western blot (L. Van Melderen, unpublished results), which most likely is the result of an enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis. Apolar residues were also buried in a small hydrophobic cluster between residues Val53 and Arg57. However, these residues did not show any NOEs to the N-terminal domain. In order to analyze the dynamical properties of CcdA 15N spin-lattice relaxation times (T1), 15N spinspin relaxation times (T2), and steady-state {1H}-15N NOEs were acquired. Higher mobility of the individual residues is indicated by lower T1, higher T2 and lower (or more negative) {1H}-15N NOEs.

a Due to the paucity and low intensity of signals belonging to conformer "c", the structures were calculated only for conformer "a" and "b". A total of 200 and 150 structures of similar energies for conformer "a" and "b" were calculated with CNS, respectively. In each case the 20 structures with the lowest energies were used for the calculation of structural statistics. b Backbone atoms are N, C, C. c Including residues 3­38/3­38. In some structures the residues attributed to generously allowed and disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot map to residues in loops (V9, D10, D21 and V22). If only regions comprising secondary structure elements are taken into account the distribution is 92.3, 7.7, 0.0, 0.0 (conformer "a") and 88.5, 11.5, 0.0, 0.0 (conformer "b").

Increased mobility in CcdAC, as indicated by the absence of long range NOEs is evidenced by the relaxation behavior. The relatively short T2 relaxation times (70 ms; Figure 3) within the secondary structural elements of the RHH motif in free and DNA-bound CcdA point to their rigidity. More flexible residues with T1  550 ms and T2  100 ms are located in the loops connecting the -sheet with 1 as well as 1 with 2. In conformer "a", CcdAC has the shortest T1 and longest T2 values as expected. Together with the residual dipolar couplings, which averaged to zero, these data indicate that CcdAC tumbles isotropically in solution. Even though in all conformers CcdAC is generally much more mobile than CcdAN, a region of decreased mobility was detected between residues 53 and 68, which is most obvious in conformer "b". In this conformer, the residues folding back upon the highly structured region (Ala66­Asp67) and those burying their hydrophobic side-chains (Val53­Arg57) show greatly reduced flexibility compared to conformer "a". It is noteworthy that several NOEs indicative of an -helix have been found between residues Val53

and Arg57. However, due to the enhanced flexibility of this region no defined helix was found in the calculated structure. Although a complete structure determination of conformer "c" could not be performed, relaxation data show that in this conformation CcdAC is highly flexible as well. CcdA­CcdB interaction To map the regions of CcdA involved in the binding to the toxin CcdB a titration of unlabeled CcdB with increasing amounts of uniformly 13 C/15N labeled CcdA was carried out. Significant chemical shift changes were observed for NH resonances of residues located within the C-terminal region of CcdA only (residues between Val46 and Asp71) and addition of CcdB had no effect on the N-terminal domain (Figure 4(a)). Thus, the CcdAC region is solely responsible for the binding to CcdB and no significant structural changes are induced in CcdAN. Traces of proteases remaining in the CcdB solution digested CcdAN while CcdAC was protected against proteolysis even after weeks at room

temperature. The remaining signals of CcdA could be assigned with a 3D HNCA and several amino acid-type specific MUSIC experiments.29,30 They were all located in the C-terminal region (Figure 4(a)). This points to a very tight complex between CcdB and the 30 carboxy-terminal residues of CcdA. Normalized chemical shift changes ( norm = |(1H)|+ 0.2*|(15N)|) between free and CcdB bound CcdA for the remaining residues are shown in Figure 4(b) for conformer "a" (white bars) and conformer "b" (black bars). CcdA­DNA interaction DNA-binding experiments indicated that the ccd proteins bind to several sites spaced over a 113 bp fragment encompassing the promoter of the ccd operon and the beginning of the CcdA ORF.13 This region contains a 6 bp palindromic sequence (5-

GTATAC-3) which has been suggested to be the nucleation site for binding of multiple CcdA-CcdB complexes.10 We confirmed the binding of CcdA to this palindromic sequence by titration experiments with DNA fragments containing either the 5GTATAC-3 sequence or a random sequence. Binding (as observed by chemical shift mapping) was found only for the fragment containing the palindromic region. Therefore, we carried out structural investigations on CcdA in complex with a 12 bp DNA duplex fragment d(5-TATGTATACCCG-3) of the ccd OP region comprising the 6 bp palindrome (starting at position 4). Upon complex formation large chemical shift perturbations were induced for several resonances of CcdA (Figure 1(b)), especially those near the N terminus (Figure 1(c)) and for the 12-mer DNA duplex (G4­C9, G4­C9). However, the overall structure of CcdA in the complex is essentially the same as in the free state based on

NOEs and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). For structural statistics see Table 2. The backbone r.m.s. d. value between the structure in the free and DNAbound states of CcdAN for the Gln3­Arg38 region was 1.4 Å. CcdAN is bound to DNA by insertion of the highly positively charged -sheet into the major groove (Figure 5). The two helices 1 are positioned parallel to the DNA strand. Nucleic acid binding buries a surface of approximately 1000 Å2 and shields a strongly positively charged region of CcdA. The structure reveals that the 5-GTATAC-3 palindrome in d(5-TATGTATACCCG-3) is specifically recognized by the antitoxin. CcdAN grasps the backbone of the DNA strand, making potential hydrogen bonding contacts between phosphate groups on this strand and both side-chains (OH of Thr8HN, Thr8HN, Ser25 and Ser25) and mainchain amides (Thr6HN and Thr6HN) of the protein. These backbone interactions position the domain over B-form DNA so that two basic residues (Arg4 and Arg4) as well as two threonine residues (Thr6 and Thr6) bind specifically to the bases of the major groove. Thereby, the guanidinium groups of Arg4/ Arg4 form hydrogen bonds to the O6 and/or N7

atoms of G4 and/or O4 of T5, as indicated by NOEs detected between the Arg4H/Arg4H and the methyl groups of T7/T7. The amino protons of A6/ A6 and A8/A8 can mediate additional interactions with the nitrogen atoms of the guanidinium group of Arg4/Arg4. However, the absence of NOEs to the guanidinium head group prohibits an unambiguous contact assignment. The positioning of Arg4/ Arg4 would be incompatible with cytosine at position 5/5. Further specificity is achieved by hydrophobic interactions between Thr6H/Thr6H and the methyl groups of T5/T5. Based on all these observed base-specific interactions, we conclude that maximum interaction is achieved with an 5XTATAY-3 (X = A, G; Y = C, T) core motif. In order to confirm the specific DNA recognition CcdA was also titrated with a 15 bp DNA duplex comprising the random sequence d(5-TTTCGGACCTTTACC-3). Absence of binding of this DNA oligonucleotide to CcdA was confirmed by unchanged chemical shifts in the 15N-1H HSQC experiment even at a fivefold excess of DNA. 15 N relaxation data were also obtained for the CcdA­DNA 12mer complex (Figure 6). Besides a

Chemical shift changes were observed for all NH resonances of residues located within CcdAC. No chemical shift changes were observed for CcdAN. The residues located in CcdAC (green peaks; labels written in circles) were unaffected by residual proteases in the CcdB solution which successively digested CcdAN.

general trend towards lower T2, higher T1 and more positive {1H}-15N NOE values as typically found for larger systems, the binding of CcdA to DNA did not change the overall relative flexibility. The N-terminal domain was still quite rigid and the C terminus very flexible. In addition to the 6 bp palindrome (labeled I in Figure 7) two 4 bp TATA palindromes (II and III) are present within the ccd operon upstream to the 6 bp palindrome. Chemical shift titrations of CcdA with DNA fragments comprising region I (12 bp, one potential binding site), region I­II (22 bp, two potential binding sites) and region I­III (33 bp, three potential binding sites) at high ionic strengths were performed. We were able to study a 71 kDa (CcdA2)3­DNA complex by NMR chemical shift

mapping. Decreasing average dissociation constants were determined by chemical shift titrations of CcdA with DNA comprising one (KD = 149( ± 30) M), two (KD = 71( ± 24) M) and three (KD = 59( ± 17) M) binding sites. This increasing binding constant (decreasing dissociation constant) for three binding sites points to cooperative binding. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that CcdA binds the region I­III fragment with 1:6 stoichiometry in agreement with a (CcdA2)3­DNA complex. The titration curve could not be fitted using a single or two different dissociation constants. However, a very good fit was obtained using a three-site binding model and allowed extraction of three different binding constants from the isothermals (Figure 8).

a Due to the paucity and low intensity of signals belonging to conformer "c", the structures were calculated only for conformer "a" and "b".

dissociation constants probably represent interaction of CcdA with the two 4 bp palindromes (regions II and III) upstream of the higher-affinity (KD = 2.5( ± 0.5) M) 6 bp palindrome. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were also carried out using DNA region I only. However, due to its reduced binding strength a large amount of DNA was needed and this rendered the fitting procedure unreliable. The center-to-center distance between the potential binding sites is between 10 bp and 12 bp, indicating that the binding sites align on the same side of DNA and that the three CcdA homodimers are close enough to interact. Looking at the orientation of the CcdA dimer bound to DNA (see Figure 5) shows that the loop between 1 and 2 is oriented in such a way that the side-chains of the residues located in the loop (around V22) might form hydrophobic contacts and mediate cooperativity. A complete structure determination of a 48 kDa

complex of two CcdA2 dimers bound to region I­II DNA using NMR is not feasible due to size limitations. However, we probed the potential protein oligomerization interface with paramagnetic Gd-diethylenetriaminepentaacetate-bis(methylamide) (Gd-DTPA-BMA). This agent has been reported to be very inert against proteins and is therefore suited to probe protein­protein interactions. Paramagnetic metal ions enhance T1 relaxation of nearby spins. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs) of amide protons were determined for the complex of CcdA with the region I­II and the region I DNA fragments. Minor relaxation enhancements were measured for the amide protons buried in hydrophobic cores and by ligands such as DNA. Residues exposed to the solvent and therefore located in spatial proximity to the paramagnetic center are strongly affected. For the region CcdAregion I DNA complex (Figure 9(a)) we determined low PRE factors for the 1H spins located in the -

sheet buried by the cognate DNA (Gln3­Val9) as well as for all residues buried in the hydrophobic core (Leu16, Leu17, Leu27 and Val28). In contrast, higher relaxation rates upon addition of Gd-DTPABMA were observed for the solvent exposed residues located in loops (Asp10­Ser13 and Asp21­ Asn23), -helices and the intrinsically unstructured CcdAC domain. Investigation of CcdA-region I­II

DNA complex (Figure 9(b)) revealed similar relaxation enhancements as observed for CcdA­region I DNA complex but a strong reduction of PRE factors for Asn21 and Val22 located in the loop between 1/ 1 and 2/2 (Figure 9(c)). As a decrease of relaxation rates indicates less solvent accessibility of the 1H spins, our results strongly suggest that this loop is responsible for dimer­dimer interactions of

multiple CcdA dimers bound to longer DNA stretches. In order to confirm that the dimer­dimer interaction involves Val22, we tested the ability of the CcdAV22H (Val22 to His) mutant to repress transcription of the ccd operon in the presence of CcdB. This mutant was partially defective for autoregulation (Figure 9(d)), which confirms the NMR results and also establish their significance in vivo.

Discussion
Four structurally different toxin­antitoxin complexes 17-20 and one complex of the N-terminal domain of an antitoxin bound to a specific camel VHH fragment have been reported21 so far. Bound antitoxins have different structures ranging from a three-helix bundle (22), a partially -helical structure extensively wrapped around the toxin (RelB) to a -barrel (MazE).17-19 Here we present the structure of the antitoxin CcdA in a free state and in complex with its cognate DNA. CcdA forms a dimer

The isotherm was fitted to a three-site binding model.

both free and bound to DNA and it displays a unique fold among the structurally characterized antitoxins. It shares sequence identities below 15% to any other protein, but the DNA binding and topology of secondary structural elements assign CcdAN to the RHH fold. There are large deviations of CcdAN to the currently structurally characterized members of the RHH superfamily22-28 therefore classifying a new family within this fold. The main differences are the lengths of the first helix and the loop between the two helices, which are quite short in CcdA compared to all other known RHH proteins. In addition, the -sheet in CcdA is not as curved as in other RHH proteins. In contrast to the well-structured N-terminal domain of CcdA the C-terminal region is very mobile. CcdAC forms three different conformations, all of which are highly flexible. CcdA is an unstable protein that is degraded by the Lon ATP-dependent protease.9,11 The lack of structure of CcdAC is most likely responsible for the instability of CcdA. We observed that in one of the conformers, the residues 66 and 67 of CcdAC fold back onto CcdAN. The foldback might have an important role in providing some intermediate stability to the antitoxin, since it shields hydrophobic residues which would otherwise be exposed to the solvent. Deletion of this region in the CcdA-11 mutant increased its instability. It might also reduce the energy barrier

upon complex formation between CcdA and the CcdB toxin by "preforming" structural elements needed for the interaction between the two partners. Indeed, the CcdAC flexible region is responsible for the binding to CcdB.31 We observed that upon binding to CcdB, CcdAC becomes structured and that residues 46 to 72 are shielded in the complex. The Lon recognition site(s) or residue(s) might lie in this region, since binding to CcdB stabilizes CcdA.9,11 Intrinsically unstructured regions have also been detected in other antitoxins.32,33 These regions encompass either the C-terminal region (MazE and ParD)18,32 or the full-length protein (Phd and YefM)33,34 and as for CcdA they seem to be involved in toxin binding. In addition to interact with their cognate toxins to inhibit their lethal activity, antitoxins are transcriptional regulators. Expression of both the antitoxin and the toxin is regulated at the level of transcription by the antitoxin alone or by a toxin­antitoxin complex (autoregulation). Although CcdA has the capacity to bind DNA in vitro,35 CcdA and CcdB are required for autoregulation of the ccd operon.16 The structure of the CcdA­DNA complex is the first of any antitoxin bound to its cognate DNA. Binding of CcdA to DNA is mediated through insertion of the N-terminal -sheet into the major groove of DNA. The base-specific interactions involve residues Arg4, Thr6 and Thr8 whereby Arg4 forms most of the hydrogen bonds with a high affinity site (6 bp palindrome 5-GTATAC-3). The importance of Arg4 has already been shown by mutational studies. CcdAR4A was unable to mediate autoregulation as well as binding to the OP DNA in vitro.15 Single mutations of Thr6 and Thr8 (T6A and T8A) resulted only in a slight reduction of the autoregulatory function, while the CcdAT6AT8A double mutant was 25% less efficient for repression than wild-type CcdA establishing the involvement of Thr6 and Thr8 in DNA binding in vivo.36 We have identified two additional CcdA binding sites of lower affinity upstream of the high affinity site (2 palindromes of 4 bp: 5-TATA-3). The binding of three CcdA dimers to DNA enhances the overall binding strength and specificity for the CcdA operon region. Our NMR data show that CcdA binds to these three sites and that CcdA dimers bridge each other via involvement of Val22. Two types of CcdA­CcdB complexes are able to form, depending on the CcdA:CcdB ratio. 9,35 When the CcdA:CcdB ratio is higher or equal to 1, a complex composed of a dimer of CcdA and a dimer of CcdB (CcdA2­CcdB2) is formed. This complex has a strong DNA-binding activity in vitro and is thought to be the repression complex. When the CcdA:CcdB ratio is lower than 1, a complex composed of a dimer of CcdA and two dimers of CcdB (CcdA2­CcdB4) is formed. This complex is devoid of repression activity.35 The biological relevance is that under conditions in which the toxin is in excess, the repression is alleviated and synthesis of both proteins is achieved. By ensuring an antitoxin:toxin ratio greater than 1, this me-

chanism could prevent the harmful effect of CcdB. Our electrophoretic mobility shift assay show that maximum retardation of the region I­III is achieved when the CcdB:CcdA:DNA ratio was 6:6:1 (Figure 10(b), rightmost lane), confirming the binding of three (CcdA2­CcdB2) complexes to the three binding sites. Increasing ratios of CcdB:CcdA (going from right to left in Figure 10(b)) first give looser DNA binding of an intermediate (CcdA2­CcdB2-4)three­ DNA complex and at CcdB:CcdA ratios above  2 completely disrupt binding to DNA. Based on this result and on our NMR data, we propose that the CcdA dimers (CcdA2) are involved in two types of interaction: (i) they interact with each other via Val22; and (ii) they interact with CcdB through the CcdAC region, each CcdAC region interacting with a different dimer of CcdB (Figure 10(a)). Thus, one dimer of CcdB bridges two dimers of CcdA. Addition of another CcdB2 to the (CcdA2­CcdB2)­

DNA complex causes sterical hindrance and therefore, loosens the interaction of the proteic complex with DNA. Thus, CcdA forms the basis for a repressor switch that is dependent upon the concentration of the toxin. The DNA binding properties of ParD and Phd were already biochemically investigated and allowed location of the specific binding sites within a 23 and 10 bp DNA duplex, respectively.37,38 By inspection of the OP regions downstream the ORFs of ParD and Phd we found 6 bp fragments representing the inverted (ParD; 5-CATATG-3) or highly similar (Phd; 5-GTACAC-3) DNA stretches. This points to a structurally similar mode of antitoxin­DNA interaction within these systems, for which our data provide a model. Large similarities in the 3D structures of CcdB and MazF have been reported based on their 3D crystal structures, although the toxins function quite differently.18,21 Surprisingly, the N-terminal do-

Figure 10. Mechanism of CcdA autoregulation. (a) Model of the molecular mechanisms of autoregulation in the ccd system. Various CcdA­CcdB­DNA complexes are formed depending on the concentration of unbound CcdB2. At low CcdB2 concentrations CcdA2 binds to at least three palindromes within the ccd operon in vitro. The cooperativity between CcdA dimers rapidly increases the binding constant when more than one binding site is occupied. At a CcdB:CcdA ratio of up to 1 the affinity of CcdA for its cognate DNA approaches a maximum by formation of a 1:1 (CcdA2)n(CcdB2)n complex (DNA33: n = 3), which represses transcription in vivo. CcdB interacts with the CcdA dimers, which are ideally spaced along the DNA stretch. At increasing CcdB concentrations a CcdA2­(CcdB2)2 complex is formed which sterically loosens a DNA­(CcdB2)3(CcdA2)3 complex. As a consequence no cooperative DNA-binding is achieved, and the affinity of CcdA for DNA decreases and more antitoxin is transcribed. (b) Bandshift assay of the CcdA­CcdB­DNA33 complex. The ratio CcdB:CcdA increases from right to left. The concentration of DNA and CcdA remains constant. Positions of free DNA and of the DNA­(CcdB2)3(CcdA2)3 complex are labeled.

mains of CcdA and MazE adopt completely different protein folds. In addition CcdAN is not affected at all upon binding to CcdB, although a direct interaction between the N-terminal region of MazE with MazF has been found.18 These differences between antitoxin structures for two TA systems with very similar toxin folds confirm the recent proposal that TA loci have evolved through gene shuffling or partner switching during evolution.39 In conclusion, our study provides a structural basis for the molecular interactions of CcdA with its cognate DNA and toxin. CcdA is composed of two structural modules that have distinct functions: (i) CcdAN has a dimeric ribbon-helix-helix arrangement that binds DNA; and (ii) CcdAC is very flexible and is involved in toxin binding. We proposed that formation of the (CcdA2­CcdB2)3­ DNA complex involves interactions between CcdA dimers and the bridging of two CcdA2 by a dimer of CcdB. Addition of CcdB modifies these interactions to give rise to a CcdA2­CcdB4 that is unable to interact with DNA. CcdA inhibits the toxicity of CcdB through the binding via an intrinsically unstructured region at the C terminus and is

susceptible to proteolysis in free form because of its large unstructured region.

Preparation of protein, DNA and complex samples Unlabeled wild-type CcdA and uniformly 15N/13C- and N-labeled CcdAR70K (for the amino acid sequence see Figure 1(a)) were expressed in SG22623 Escherichia coli strains carrying the pKK-ccdA or pKK-ccdAR70K vectors. The purification was carried out according to a slightly modified protocol.9 Bacteria were grown in LB broth for unlabeled or in 15N or 13C/15N labeled Silantes media for labeled CcdA. A heat treatment, where the protein solution was heated to 80 °C and cooled down afterwards, resulted in a stable protein.32 For NMR spectroscopy, the buffer was changed to 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide and the protein was concentrated to about 0.5 mM. 10% 2 H2O was added. For the 2D-13 C,15 N-filtered, 13 C,15 N-edited NOESY-HSQC experiment, 15 N/13 Clabeled CcdAR70K was mixed 1:1 with unlabeled CcdAR70K, heated to 80 °C and cooled down afterwards in order to produce a 15N/13C-labeled/unlabeled-dimer

For the calculation of the protein­DNA complex we included additional dihedral angles for the deoxyribose residues and base-pair planarity, as well as excluding-NOEs. The phi/psi dihedral angle restraints were calculated from chemical shifts of backbone N, C and C using TALOS.49 Hydrogen bonds were imposed as distance restraints exclusively for regions of regular strand or -helical structure and DNA base-pairing. The Ramachandran map, hydrogen bonds, secondary structure elements and root-mean-square deviations were calculated and analyzed using MOLMOL.50 Structure and folding similarity searches were performed using DALI51 and VAST.52 Isothermal titration calorimetry Prior to analysis the samples were dialyzed against 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 100 mM NaCl and concentrated. The titrations were carried out at 30 °C in a MSC-ITC (MicroCal) calorimeter. 33 bp DNA (0.206 mM, concentratuin determined by absorbance at 254 nm) was injected into the calorimetry cell comprising CcdA (0.034 mM; determined by absorbance at 280 nm). For adjustment of the baseline control injections of 33 bp DNA into buffer were used. Data were extracted and processed with the MicroCal Origin 5.0 software package. Bandshift assay Experiments were carried out by applying 10 l of a solution containing 2.5 M 33-mer DNA, 15 M CcdA and increasing concentrations of CcdB as indicated by the CcdB:CcdA ratio (buffer 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 100 mM NaCl). These samples were applied on Invitrogen Novex 6% DNA retardation gels, run at a constant voltage of 100 V for 50 min and stained with ethidium bromide. Promoter activity assay CSH50 E. coli strains containing the pULB2600 (O/P ccd::lacZ) and the pULB2707 (wt CcdA) or its ccdAV22H derivative were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB containing chloramphenicol (20 g/ml) and tetracycline (15 g/ml). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:400, samples were removed and -galactosidase assays were performed on a Spectramax 250 spectrophotometer.53 Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement Gd-DTPA-BMA was obtained by chromatographic purification of the commercially available reagent OmniscanTM on a reversed phase column.

The 13, 23 and 34-mer oligonucleotides comprising fragments of the ccd OP region were annealed and the quantity of the annealing verified by NMR spectroscopy. CcdA­DNA complexes were prepared by addition of equimolar DNA solution after protein heat treatment. Dialysis and concentration were performed as described above but at 100 mM NaCl. pULB2600/pULB2707ccdAV22H (CcdAV22H mutant) was constructed in pULB2707 (pKT-ccd) resistant to tetracycline (15 g/ml). pULB2600/pKT279 and pULB2600/pULB2707 (wt CcdA) were expressed in E. coli CSH50 for the -galactosidase assay as described elsewhere.15 NMR spectroscopy Spectra were acquired at 25 °C on Varian Unity INOVA 600 MHz and Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz (single axis z-gradient cryo-probe) NMR spectrometers in 90% aqueous buffer/10% 2H2O solvent except for the 3D HCCH-TOCSY (100% 2H2O). Data were processed using NMRPipe41 and analyzed in NMRView.42 1H, 15N and 13 C resonances and NOE cross-peaks were assigned using 2D homonuclear and standard triple resonance experiments.43 Inter- and intramolecular NOEs were differentiated by a 2D 1H-1H version of a 15N,13C-edited, 15 N,13C-filtered NOESY-HSQC44 which was acquired on a complex of 13C,15N double-labeled and unlabeled CcdA as well as on 13C,15N double-labeled CcdA in complex with its cognate unlabeled DNA. NH RDCs of CcdA and CcdA-DNA12 were measured from 1JNH differences in 2D IPAP 15N-1H HSQCs, in the presence or absence of 10 and 16 mg ml- 1 Pf1 filamentous phage, respectively.45 15N longitudinal (T1), 15N transverse (T2) and {1H}­15N heteronuclear NOE relaxation data46 were obtained using standard methods and fitted using the NMRView rate analysis tool.42 Relaxation delays from 0 to 3000 ms and 10 to 230 ms were employed for T1 and T2 measurements. The {1H}­15N heteronuclear NOEs were obtained for 1H-saturated and-unsaturated spectra (3 s saturation time). The effect of DNA and CcdB binding was monitored by 15N-1H HSQCs of CcdA in the buffer mentioned above at different amounts of NaCl (CcdB, 500 mM; DNA, 300 mM). Data were collected using 0.3 mM 15N-labeled CcdA titrated with DNA12, DNA22, DNA33 or unlabeled CcdB titrated with 0.5 mM 13C/15N-labeled CcdA until no more changes were observed (1:5 molar ratio) and a 1:1 complex was formed, respectively.
