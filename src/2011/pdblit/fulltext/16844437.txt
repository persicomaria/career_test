2-Hydroxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate (Cisopropyl-HODA) hydrolase (CumD), an enzyme of the cumene biodegradation pathway encoded by the cumD gene of Pseudomonasfluorescens IPOl, was purified to homogeneity from an overexpressing Escherichia coli strain. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration demonstrated that it is a dimeric enzyme with a subunit molecular mass of 32 kDa. The pH optima for activity and stability were 8.0 and 7.0-9.0, respectively. The enzyme exhibited a biphasic Arrhenius plot of catalysis with two characteristic energies of activation with a break point at 20°C. The enzyme has a K, of 7.3 pM and a keptof 21 s-l for 6-isopropyl-HODA (150 mM phosphate, pH 7.5, 25"C), and its substrate specificity covers larger C6 substituents compared with another monoalkylbenzene hydrolase, TodF. Unlike TodF, CumD could slightly hydrolyze 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate (6-phenyl-HODA). A mutant enzyme as to a putative active site residue, S103A, had 105-fold lower activity than that of the wild-type enzyme.

Aromatic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and monoalkylbenzenes are exceptionally stable xenobiotics, and many of them are suspected carcinogens (1). As a consequence of their widespread use and subsequent introduction into the environment, these compounds have become some of the most serious environmental pollutants. To improve the biological degradation of these compounds, detailed study for engineering of the catalytic activity and of the specificities of component enzymes in the degradation pathway is required (2). pathway occurs in the degradation prometa-Cleavage cesses for various aromatic compounds such as biphenyls, toluene, ethylbenzene, and cumene (isopropylbenzene) (Fig. 1) (3). The meta-cleavage compounds (2-hydroxy-6-oxohexa-2,4-dienoates; HODAs) are then hydrolyzed, and the resulting 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoates are further converted to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (4, 5). The hydrolases (HODA hydrolases) responsible for the degradation of biphenyls, toluene, ethylbenzene, and cumene, are called BphD (EC 3.7.1.8) (6), TodF (EC 3.7.1.9) (7), EtbD (8), and CumD/IpbD (9, lo), respectively. In addition, the genes encoding homologous enzymes involved in the catabolism of a variety of other aromatic compounds have been cloned (see Fig. 2 in Ref. 11). Some studies have indicated * Corresponding author. e-mail: asfushi@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp phone: +81-(0)3-5841-5151 fax: +81-(0)3-5841-5337

that the substrate specificity of meta-cleavage compound hydrolase is a key determinant of the overall selectivity of the pathway with respect to the degradation of various aromatic compounds and their halogenated derivatives (1216). Moreover, some studies have indicated that BphD limits the rate of the degradation of PCBs through this pathway (13, 14, 17, 18). Although some examples of biochemical characterization of HODA hydrolases have been reported (19-25), quantitative data on the substrate specificity are only available for MhpC from Escherichia coli (21), BphD from Burkholderia cepacia LB400, TodF from Pseudomonas putida Fl (12), and ThnD from Sphingomonas macrogoltabidus TFA (11). Recently, the crystal structure of BphD from Rhodococcus sp. RHAl was reported (26). The metabolism of cumene (isopropylbenzene) was initially studied for p putida Fl (27) and I? putida RE204 (28). P j' uorescens IPOl was isolated from soil by means of enrichment culture in a minimal medium containing cumene as the sole source of carbon and energy, and the genes for cumene degradation have been cloned (29, 30). This strain can grow on cumene, toluene, and various other aromatic compounds, but not on biphenyl. In studies involving resting cells of E. coli harboring the cum genes, it was indicated that the degradation of biphenyl is blocked by CumD (9). In a preliminary study, a crude extract of recombinant E. coli cells harboring the cumD gene showed considerable enzymatic hydrolase activity toward 6-isopro-

The specificity of the enzyme for various HODAs was studied as to means of steady-state kinetics. MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ethylbenzene, cumene, and 2,3-dihydroxybiChemicals phenyl were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka). 3-Methylcatechol was purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo (Tokyo). The enzymes used for DNA manipulation were obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Tokyo), New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA, USA), Takara Shuzo (Kyoto), and Toyobo Biochemicals (Osaka). Other chemicals were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries or Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto), unless otherwise noted. DNA was manipuDNA manipulation and mutagenesis lated using standard protocols (3 1). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with a Mutan-Super Express Km Kit (Takara Shuzo), and the DNA fragments were sequenced to check the mutations. Oligonucleotides 5' -TCG TAG GTA ATG CAT TCG GTG G-3' , 5' -GAT TAT TCA TGG TCG CGA GCC TCA GGT TGT TC-3' , and 5' -GGG CGA TGT GGC GCC TGG ACA CAA ATT G-3' were synthesized to obtain mutant enzymes S103A, D224A, and H252A, respectively. From the expression vector for the wild-type enzyme, pIP140 (9), a l374-base pair HindIII-BarnHI fragment containing the whole cumD gene was replaced with HindHIBumHI fragments of mutant enzymes to construct expression vectors. Expression and purification of the CumD enzyme E. coli JM109 cells harboring the expression vector were grown at 37°C for 10 h in 1L 2 x YT medium (I .6% tryptone, 1.O% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) containing 50 ug/ml ampicillin and 1 mM isopro-

pyl- I -thio-fl-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) from a I % (v/v) seeding of an overnight pre-culture. 8.5 g of the cells were harvested by centrifugation and then suspended in 45 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCI buffer (pH 7.5), which was used throughout as described below. Purification was performed at low temperature (4°C) throughout the following steps. After disruption of the cells by sonication, the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation. From the supernatant obtained, an active fraction was separated on a column of DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.5 M NaCI. Then, solid ammonium sulfate was slowly added to the active fraction with stirring to I .6 M. The enzyme was further purified on a column of butyl-Toyopearl 650 M (Tosoh, Tokyo) with a decreasing linear gradient of I .6 to 0 M with ammonium sulfate. The final step of purification was performed on a Mono-Q HR 515 column with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.3 M NaCI. The purity of the proteins was checked by SDS-PAGE (32), followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein concentrations were determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Preparation of substrates and determination of their extinction coefficients 6-Isopropyl-HODA was prepared from cumene by the resting cell method. E. co/i JM109 cells harboring pIPlO (9), which contains cumABC gene (cumene dioxygenase, dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and 3-isopropylcatechol dioxygenase genes of p jluoYescens IPOI), were grown at 37°C in 2xYT medium containing 50 ug/ml ampicillin. When the cell growth reached an optical density of about 0.7 at 660 nm, IPTG (final concentration, 0.5 mM) was added to the culture medium. After further cultivation for 5 h, the cells were harvested, washed twice with 50mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH7.0), and then re-suspended in the same buffer. The cells were adjusted to an optical density of 7.0 at 660 nm and then incubated with 7.16 mM cumene for 13 h at 30°C. The supernatant was acidified to pH 3 with I M HCI and then extracted two times with ethyl acetate. Solid anhydrous sodium sulfate was added to the ethyl acetate phase for dehydration and then removed by filtration using absorbent cotton. The samples were concentrated with a centrifugal evaporator. The purity of each substrate was checked by Thin-Layer chromatography, and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using ODS120T column (Tosoh) monitored by absorption at 2 10 nm. As stock solutions, the samples were flushed with nitrogen gas, and then stored in a cold (-20°C) and dark place. 6-Methyl-HODA and 2hydroxy-6-oxoocta-2,4-dienoate (6-ethyl-HODA) were prepared from 3-methylcatechol and ethylbenzene in a similar manner, respectively. 6-Phenyl-HODA was prepared from 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl using E. coli JM I09 cells harboring pUCAl22 (33), which contains the carB gene (2' -aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol 1,2-dioxygenase gene of Pseudomonas resinovorans strain CA IO). The following extinction coefftcients (mM_` cm-` at pH 7.5 and ) 25°C were employed: for 6-methyl-HODA, 1 I .9 at 389 nm; for 6-ethyl-HODA, 10.2 at 391.5 nm; for 6-isopropyl-HODA, 10.7 at 395 nm; and for 6-phenyl-HODA, 19.8 at 434 nm (12). To determine the effect of pH on the enzyme activity, the molar extinction coefficients (25°C) of 6-isopropyl-HODA at different pHs were determined in solutions comprising 16.6-50 uM 6-isopropylHODA in 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.0-5.5), sodium phosphate (pH 6.0-7.0), Tris-HCI (pH 7.5-8.5), and Ches-NaOH (pH 9.010.0) buffers (Table I). The reported value at pH 7.5 was used as a standard for calibration. Kinetic measurements Enzymatic activity was measured by following the consumption of the yellow substrate with a DU 7400 spectrophotometer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA, USA) equipped with a thermojacketed cuvette holder. Initial velocities were determined by a least squares analysis of the progress curve using the software associated with the spectrophotometer. The standard

activity assay was performed in a total volume of 200 ~1 of 150 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 25°C containing the indicated concentrations of various HODAs. A reaction mixture before the addition of the enzyme served as a reference. The reaction was monitored at appropriate wavelength for each substrate. The amount of enzyme used in each assay was adjusted so that the progress curve was linear for at least 2 min. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that converted 1 pmol of substrate/min. Initial velocities determined at different substrate concentrations were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA). At 25"C, the effect of slight thermal inactivation cannot be excluded (see Results section). Therefore, initial velocity of the enzymatic reaction was measured within 10 min, in which the inactivation does not appear. Gel filtration The relative molecular weight of the native protein was determined with a Superdex 200 HR10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) operated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elution buffer was 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mM NaCl. A calibration curve was obtained using the following proteins (Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo): carbonic anhydrase (M,=29,000), bovine serum albumin (M,=66,000), alcohol dehydrogenase (M,= lSO,OOO), pamylase (M,=200,000), and apoferritin (M,=443,000).

RESULTS Expression, purification, and characterization of CumD 1 mM IPTG was added at the time of seeding of an overnight pre-culture, because no difference was detected if the IPTG was added when the cell growth reached an optical density of about 0.8 at 660 nm. Using E. coli JM109 cells harboring the expression vector derived from pUC 119 (34), a total 22 mg of CumD was obtained through three column chromatography steps, as summarized in Table 2. The purified CumD sample migrated as a main protein band (Fig. 2)

on SDS-PAGE, its apparent relative molecular mass being estimated to be 32,000, which was nearly identical to the value deduced from the amino acid sequence (3 1,489). Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time Of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis with a Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) gave a peak at 3 1,368 m/z (data not shown). The relative molecular mass of the native protein was approximately 58,000, as estimated by calibrated gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). CumD was strongly inhibited by 10 FM PMSF, the activity being undetectable. Effect of pH and temperature on the activity and stability The optimum pH for the enzyme activity was 8.0 (Fig. 3A). Buffers containing carboxylic acid such as sodium acetate and sodium citrate seemed to inhibit the enzyme. The enzyme was stable in the pH range of 7 to 9 at 4°C for 3 d (Fig. 3B). The optimal temperature for the enzyme activity was around 47.5"C (Fig. 4). Determination of the activation energy revealed that the enzyme exhibited a biphasic or discontinuous Arrhenius plot with two characteristic energies of activation and a break point at 20°C (Fig. 4, inset). The Arrhenius activation energies were 47 kJ.mol-' between 5 and 2O"C, and 17kJ.mol-' between 20 and 47.5"C. The enzyme retained its full activity up to 20°C for 30 min, and about 80% between 30 and 50°C. The enzyme was almost completely inactivated above 60°C (data not shown).

Enzyme activity was assayed at 25°C in the following buffers (100 mM concentration); sodium acetate (circles), sodium citrate (crosses and dotted line), sodium phosphate (squares and dotted line), and Tris-HC1 (diamonds), containing 60 PM 6-isopropyl-HODA. (B) Effect of pH on the stability of CumD. The enzyme solution (0.04 mgiml) was incubated at 4°C for 3 d in the following buffers (50 mM concentration); McIlvaine N+HPO,-citric acid buffer (circles), Tris-HCI (squares and dotted line), Ches-NaOH (diamonds), and Caps-NaOH (crosses and dotted line). After the incubation, 5 pl of each enzyme solution was mixed with 495 pl of 150 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 89 pM 6-isopropyl-HODA, and then assayed at 25°C.

tate residues conserved in alp hydrolases The three completely conserved residues of CumD, Ser103, Asp224, and His252, were replaced with alanine residues by site-directed mutagenesis. However, the D224A and H252A mutants were found in the insoluble fraction (data not shown). Only the S103A mutant was found in the soluble fraction, and could be purified by the same steps as for the wild-type enzyme. Gel filtration and CD spectroscopic analysis from 190 to 240 nm showed that the S103A mutant enzyme had the same relative molecular weight and secondary structure content as those of the wild type enzyme (data not shown). The catalytic activity of the S 103A mutant enzyme was less than 6.1 x 1o-4 U/mg, which is less than 6 x 10' fold to that of the wild type enzyme. DISCUSSION Gel filtration and SDS-PAGE analyses revealed that CumD is a dimer of two identical subunits. XylF from l? putida mt-2 (20), TodF from l? putida Fl (7), MhpC from E. coli (21), EtbDl from Rhodococcus sp. RHAl (24), and CmtE from p putida Fl (35) were reported to be homodimeric. The HODA-degrading enzymes from l? putida NCIB 10015 and 9865 (19) were found to be tetrameric. BphD from B. cepacia LB400 was reported to be tetrameric with a 222 molecular symmetry (12). Two hydrolases purified from Sphingomonas wittichii strain RW 1 were found to be monomeric (25), whereas the BphD from Rhodococcus sp. RHAl was octameric. As mentioned already (12, 24), the oligomeric structures of the enzymes are not correlated with the substrate specificity, nor with the phylogenetic grouping. The optimum pH (8.0) for CumD was similar to those reported for the Pseudomonas enzymes. The optimum pHs of the HODA hydrolases from &! putida NCIB 10015 and NCIB 9865, and F1putida mt-2 were reported to be 8.6 (19), and 7.0-7.5 (20), respectively. MhpC from E. coli has a

Steady-state kinetic analysis CumD showed classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics for all of the substrates used here. The steady-state kinetic parameters of CumD with 6methyl-, 6-ethyl-, 6-isopropyl-, and 6-phenyl-HODA are shown in Table 3, and compared with those of TodF from fl putida Fl and BphD from B. cepacia LB400. The enzyme concentrations of CumD subunit in the reaction mixtures were 1.2 nM for 6-methyl- and 6-isopropyl-HODA, and 0.47 nM for 6-ethyl-HODA. Because of the very low catalytic activity toward 6-phenyl-HODA, the assay was carried out with 70 nM in the reaction mixture with this substrate. The obtained K,,, value for 6-phenyl-HODA (0.74 PM) was only about 10 times larger than the enzyme concentration. Judging from the k,,,/K,,, value, the enzyme was most specific for 6-ethyl-HODA, and its specificity decreased in the order ethyl > isopropyl > methyl > phenyl. Analysis of the specificity in terms of K, and kCatshowed that the differences in activity were for the most part the result of greater catalytic activity as to the C6 substituent (k,,,) rather than a preferential binding capacity (K,). The kCatvalue of CumD for 6-isopropyl-HODA was about 50 fold higher than that of TodF. Mutagenic analysis of the serine, histidine, and aspar-

similar optimum pH, 8.5-9.0 (21). On the other hand, BphD and EtbDl from Rhodococcus sp. RHAl showed significantly low optimum pHs (pH 6.0 and 6.5) (24). The activation energy at temperatures below the break point was found to be about 2.8fold higher than that above 20°C 47 kJ.mol-' vs. 17 kJ.moll' Discontinuous Arrhenius . plots have been obtained for some enzymes (36-39). As for the RadA protein from hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum islandicum, the activation energies below and above the break point (7S' C) are 31.7 kJ.mol-` and 14.7 , kJ.mol-` , respectively. Interestingly, the tendency of a change in activation energy is similar between CumD and RadA, and the break points are lower than the optimum growth temperature of the organism. A possible hypothesis for the break in the Arrhenius plot is the existence of two conformational states of the enzyme above and below the break point, each with a different catalytic competence (40). We replaced three residues comprising the putative "catalytic triad", Ser103, Asp224, and His252, with alanine residues. However, the D224A and H252A mutants aggregated into inclusion bodies. Only the S 103A mutant was found in the soluble fraction and thus could be purified. As expected from previous results (24, 41, 42), the S 103A mutant was almost completely inactive, and the wild-type enzyme was inhibited by PMSF. Recently, the catalytic mechanism of MhpC was shown to proceed via initial ketonization of a dienol substrate, followed by stereospecific fragmentation (21, 22). Despite the implications of the active site serine residue in the CL/~hydrolase family, the results did not support nucleophilic attack of an active site serine, but rather base-catalyzed attack of water (23). The serine residue is implicated to be the base residue of the HODA hydrolases. An interesting feature of the substrate specificity of CumD enzyme becomes apparent on comparison with those of other HODA hydrolases. The members of the HODA hydrolase family can be divided into several groups based on the results of sequence analysis (11). The substrate specificity of these enzymes for the C6 side chains of substrates corresponds well to this classification. Most of the enzymes in the group III (monoalkylbenzene group) are involved in the biodegradation of monocyclic compounds with a short C6 side chains such as toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, and

cumene. On the other hand, most of the enzymes in the group I (biphenyl group) are involved in the biodegradation of bicyclic molecules, producing substrates with larger side chains such as biphenyls, carbazole, or tetralin. On comparison with the values of TodF from p putida Fl and BphD from B. cepacia LB 400 reported by Seah et al. (12), CumD showed the highest k,, and kC,,lK, for 6-isopropylHODA (Table 3). CumD could also efficiently hydrolyze 6-methyl- and 6-ethyl-HODA. The K,,, values of CumD showed no correlation to the size of the C6 substituent, and the K,,, for 6-phenyl-HODA was the smallest among all substrates studied. On the other hand, TodF and BphD showed the smallest K, values for their cognate substrates. So, CumD acquired its preference for larger substrates by increasing its catalytic efficiency, resulting in the best k,, value among all three enzymes shown in Table 3. The substrate specificity of the CumD enzyme is well correlated with the specificity as to the utilization of aromatic carbon sources of p jluorescens IPOl (29), indicating that CumD is the major determinant of the degradation capacity of this strain. The cumD gene is located at a separate downstream position from the cluster of other cum genes for the degradation pathway and followed by a putative transposable element (IS1406) (9). So, the cumD gene might have been recruited separately from other genes. Because HODA hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step of the cumene degradation pathway during the cultivation in the enrichment culture of cumene, CumD may be evolved to increase kCat, presumably in the high concentration of the 6-isopropyl-HODA. These results clearly indicate that CumD can utilize substrates with larger substituents at the C6 position than TodF. HODA hydrolases in the monoalkylbenzene group seems to be specific for substrates with various side chains, at least up to the size of an isopropyl group (volume of C6 side chain, 149.9 A3) (12). In addition to the specificity for isopropyl side chain, CumD can hydrolyze 6-phenyl-HODA, although the k,,,/K,,, is 71 times smaller than that for 6-isopropyl-HODA. It seems to be difficult for HODA hydrolases to effectively hydrolyze both biphenyl (274.3 A3) and monoalkylbenzene substrates with a short C6 side chain, because no such example has been found to date (11, 20, 21, 24, 43). However, BphD from B. cepacia LB400 can de-

grade substrates with an intermediate-sized C6 side chain, such as 6-isopropy-HODA and 6-ethyl-HODA, at a certain extent (Table 3). On the basis of the crystal structure, the hydrophobic surface of the "D-part" and Met1 11 of BphD from Rhodococcus sp. WA1 are assumed to play key role in determining the substrate specificity of HODA hydrolases (26). Analysis of the crystal structure of CumD is now in progress (unpublished data). The residues on the surface of the "D-part" of CumD are somewhat different from those of BphD, because insertions and deletions in the lid domain resulted in considerable difference of the 3D-structure. On the other hand, the difference of substrate specificity between CumD and TodF seems to be caused by only a few different residues on the surface of the "D-part", because these enzymes are highly homologous (63.8% identity), and the residue corresponding to Met111 of BphD from Rhodococcus sp. RHAl is phenylalanine in both CumD and TodF. The mechanism underlying the substrate specificity of HODA hydrolases will be elucidated by 3D-structure analysis of CumD enzyme. ACKNOWLEDGMENT
