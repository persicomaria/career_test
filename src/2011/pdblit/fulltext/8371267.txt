Abstract1. Neuraminidase was obtained by (A) bromelain solubilization or (B) by treatment with N-lauroylsarcosine. 2. 5-N-acetyl-2-O-(3-methoxyphenyl)-a-D-neuraminic acid, employed as substrate, avoids the interference produced by the thiobarbituric acid method. and is not interfered by the ampholytes. 3. Only about 20% of original enzyme activity was lost after electrofocusing. The sample from procedure A showed two peaks, corresponding to pIs 4.4 and 5.6. The sample from procedure B, having a higher activity, showed only one peak at pI 4.4. 4. Samples A and B showed different K, and hydrolysis rate with N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose and glycophorin A. It was not found significantly different with other substrates: z,-acid glycoprotem. brain gangliosides. 5-N-acetyl-2-0-(3-methoxyphenyl)-a-D-neuraminic acid and 2'-(4-methyl umbelliferyl)-%-oN-acetylneuraminic acid

INTRODUCTION

The purification of the influenza viral neuraminidase (acylneuraminyl hydrolase, EC 3.2.1.18, sialidase) requires the release of the neuraminidase from the outer surface of the virion either by proteolytic cleavage, which removes a part of the neuraminidase molecule, or by addition of detergents, anionic or neutral, or organic solvents. Both detergents and organic solvents destroy the lipid layer of the virus envelope (Drzeniek, 1974). Proteolytic agents such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, pronase and B. subtilis protease, and detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulphate, Triton X-100, Tween 20 and NP40 have been extensively employed for the purification of viral neuraminidase (for reviews, see Bucher & Palese, 1975; Bottex & Fontanges, 1976). Although the use of bromelain (EC 3.4.22.4) for removing the neuraminidase from the influenza A viruses surface has been reported by Compans et al. (1970) and later by other authors (Bachmayer & Schmidt, 1972; Brand & Skehel, 1972; Aitken & Hannoun, 1980) and from influenza B viruses (Tobita & Kilbourne, 1975). its use has not been generalized. On the other hand, only a few papers (Skehel & Schild, 1971; Stantely er al., 1973; Aitken & Hannoun, 1980)
requests should be addressed.

report the use of the detergent N-laurosylsarcosine for the solubilization of the viral neuraminidase. The degree of stability during the "release", "solubilization" or "liberation" of the viral neuraminidase shows a wide variability and depends: (i) on the subtypes and strains of the different myxoviruses; (ii) on the solubilization procedures. It seems therefore that some published data on properties and purification levels of viral neuraminidase must be viewed with caution (Rosenberg & Schengrund, 1976). The use of isoelectric focusing should provide the possibility for both the characterization and the isolation of pure neuraminidase. In the present paper we report the results of the application of electrofocusing as a step in the study of the neuraminidase from influenza virus A/3QB/68 (H3N2). The enzyme was obtained after treatments of the virus by bromelain and N-lauroylsarcosine. In addition, some characteristics (molecular weight, chemical composition and kinetics) of the neuraminidase obtained by both procedures from the same viral strain are described.

Preparation qf G-us and pur~cation of neuruminidase The 3QB strain (Fazekas de St. Groth & Hannoun. 1973) of type A influenza virus A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2). was the virus used. It was grown in the allantoic cavity of 1 l-day old chick embryos, harvested and treated essentially as described by Skehel & Schild (1971) for virus purification Two procedures (A and B) were employed for purification of neuraminidase: (A) The method of Bachmayer & Schmidt (l972), based on that of Compans et al. (1970) was used, with some modifications. The purified virus (1OOmg) was suspended in 10 ml 0.1 M Tris-HCI buffer (uH 7.2) containing 0.1 mM dithioerythritol and 1 mM EDNA. Then, the sample was treated with bromelain (1 mg ml` * final concentration). After incubation at 37°C for 3 hr. the digestion mixture was centrifuged at 110,OOOg for 1 hr and the solubilized fractton was chromatographed on a Sephadex G-200 column equilibrated with 50 mM NH,HCQJ (pH 7.X) (sompla A). (B) The techniques of Stanley et al. (1973) and Aitken & Hannoun (1980) were employed. with some modifications, The pellet from the above mentioned centrifugation was resuspended in IOml 0.1 M Tris-HCI buffer (pH 7.2) and an aqueous solution of ~-lauroylsarc(~s~ne (sodium salt) was added to give a final concentration of 2.5",, in N-lauroylsarcosine. After incubation at 37 C for I hr. the suspension was dialyzed against 0.1 M Tris---HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.05", N-lauroylsarcosine and centrifuged at 110,OOOg for 1 hr. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-50 (2.5 x 20cm) column equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. Elution was carried out using a linear NaCl (O-1.5 M) gradient in the same buffer. Fractions containing neuraminidase were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration on a PM10 Amicon membrane. Aliquot portions of the neuraminidase fraction were either layered on a (2.6 x 100 cm) Ultrogel AcA-34 column equilibrated with 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 mM EDTA (sample B) or layered on a (2.5 x 1OOcm) Sephadex G-200 column equilibrated with 5OmM NH,HCO, (pH 7.8) containing 0.05",, M-lauroylsarcosine (sumpie B'). Isoelectric focusing These tests were carried out by the method described by Vesterberg (1969) in a 1fOml electrofocusing column with samples of enzyme dialyzed against distilled water. The ampholyte concentration was I"/ (w/v), in a pH range from 3.5 to 10.0 or from 4.0 to 8.0, in a sucrose gradient from 0 to 50:, (w/v). Voltage was 350 or 600V and the run was performed in 72 or 36 hr. 2-ml fractions were collected and the pH of each fraction was measured at 2'C with a Radiometer pH M-62 digital pH-meter. The neuraminidase activity in the sample both before and after electrofocusing was determined using the MeOPhe-NeuAc procedure (Santer rr al., 1978). Neuraminidase assays The incubation volume (100 or 200~1) contained the enzyme preparation (in the range between 0.44 and 2.20 pg for sampie A. and between 0.08 and 0.4Opg for sample B) and 10 or lOOfl(i of 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). The incubations were carried out at 37"C, generally for 10 min. The periodate-thiobarbiturate method of Warren (1959) modified by Aminoff (1961) was employed to determine the activity of the enzyme on the following natural substrates: N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose (Sigma, grade I, containing 85% x2-3 isomer and 15% ~2-6 isomer); fetuin (Sigma,

type III, purified by dialysis); human %,-acid glycoprotein (Pentex): gangliosides of horse brain (obtained in this laboratory by Reglero et al., 1980); glycophorin A (a gift of Dr H. Furthmayr, New Haven, Connecticutt, U.S.A.); and equine submaxillary mucin (a gift of Dr R. Pfeil, Kiel, Germany). MeOPhe-NeuAc was also used as a substrate. lOOnI of enzyme preparation were incubated at 37°C with lOO$ of the substrate solution (containing 0.40 or 0.625 pmol ml- t) for 1 hr 45 min. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 150~1 1.3 mM 4-aminoantipyrine in 1 M TrissHCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 1.334; ethanol (viv). The colored quinone yielded by the liberated methoxypheno1 with 4-aminoantipyrine in the presence of 50 /d 5 mM potassmm ferricyanide was determined at 500 nm, according to the method of Santer et ul. (1978). The stability of this substrate at the isoelectric focusing conditions was checked as follows: 100~1 of the substrate solution were incubated (in the absence of the enzyme) at 37°C for 2 hr with 100~1 of two different buffer solutions: (i) 500 mM citric-citrate (pH 4.5); (ii) 500 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 9.5); then. incubation was carried out, and addition of the 4-aminoantipyrine and potassium ferricyanide solutions, The synthetic substrate 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-a-a-Nacetylneuraminic acid (a gift of Dr T. W. Warner, la Jolla, California, U.S.A.) was also assayed and the enzymic hydrolysis was determined using 100/11 substrate solution (0.1 mg ml-`) with the substrate dissolved in 0.5 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) and 25 pl enzyme preparation. After 5 min incubation at 37°C. the reaction was stopped by addition of 2 ml 0.5 M glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 10.6) and the fluorescence was measured with excitation at 365nm and emission at 450 nm in an Aminco SPF 125 fluorimeter. The concentrations of total sialic acids were determined in the natural substrates by the resorcinoi procedure of Svennerhoim (1957) as modified by ~iettinen & TakkiLuukkainen (1959). Hemugglutinin and protein determination,~ The hemagglutinin was tested by the antibody blocking test (Webster & Darlington. 1969). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (195 1) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Polyacrylamidr gel electrophoresis This assay was carried out employing essentially the method of Ornstein (1964) and Davis (1964) with 5% acrylamide gels, run at room temperature for 60min. using Tris-glycine buffer (pH 8.3). Estimation ofmoiecuiar weight by ger~~frffr~on

Aliquots of the neuraminidase sample A (1.125 mg protein in 5 ml) and B (I.97 mg protein in 5 ml) were passed through a Sephadex G-200 column (75 x 2cm), equilibrated and eluted with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 5.8). The following proteins were used as markers in both assays: ovalbumin (mol wt approx. 44,000). bovine serum albumin (65,000). ~-globulin (160.~) and catalase (240,000). The neuramimdase position in the eluted fraction was determined using MeOPhe-NeuAc as a substrate (Santer et a/.. 1978). Amino-acid analysis Samples of neuraminidase A and B (5 pg protein) were sealed under vacuum in glass tubes containing 100~1 of constant boiling HCI and 0.1% phenol. The samples were hydrolysed at lfo'C for 24 hr and then dried under vacuum. The hydrolysed samples were dissolved in lOOn of 0.2 M sodium citrate buffer. pH 2.2. and then analysed on a Durrum MBF amino-acid analyzer with fluorescent detection using u-phthalaldehyde.

Purity of the neuraminidase Only some aliquot portions of sample A (derived after treatment with bromelain) were well separated from hema~Iutinin after Sephadex G-200 chromatography. In contrast, sample B (obtained after treatment with ~~-la~iroylsarcosine) was completely separated from hemagglutinin after chromatography on Sephadex G-200. By polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, only one band with neuraminidase activity was located using sample B and MeOPhe-NeuAc as a substrate. Sample A showed a main band accompanied by another very slight band, by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Isoelectric foaising Neuraminidase activity was determined in the electrofocused fractions, without dialysis, using MeOPheNeuAc. In the absence of enzyme, no liberation of methoxyphenol was detected. The neuraminidase derived after bromelain treatment (sample A) revealed some heterogeneity of pl. with a peak at about p1 4.4 and another one at about pI 5.6 (Fig. 1). Electrofocusing with A samples at two different enzyme concentrations, at the experimental conditions indicated in the Materials and Methods section, always produced more than one peak. However, only one peak of the enzymic activity with a pl value about 4.4 was found for both samples B and B

Electrofocusing with A samples was carried out at two different enzyme concentrations (4.5 mg enzyme preparation, -0; 2.25 mg enzyme preparation, G.-O). Other experimental conditions are indicated in the text.

The activity of sample A was about 38"/:, that of sample B (1.0 ,ug of the enzyme preparations liberated 0.18 and 0.47 nmol methoxyphenol per min, respectively). Sample A had about 25% activity towards N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose in comparison with sample B. On the other hand, about 80% of the neur~jnidase activity was recovered in the electrofocus~ samples (the activity of the samples immediately before electrofocusing was considered as 100%). Thy hydrolysis rate was the highest for N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose, followed by fetuin and by q-acid glycoprotein using both samples A and B (Fig. 3).

The K, values, calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plots, are summarized in Table 2. The K, values of the samples A and B of this neuraminidase were only different when N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose was employed as a substrate; this K, was lower for sample A. The K, corresponding to fetuin was the lowest for both neuraminidase samples. Unexpectedly, the hydrolysis rate produced by sample B on gly~ophorin (a glycoprotein with a very high N-acetylneuraminic acid concentration, according to Yoshima er al., 1980) was lower than that produced by sample A at the assay conditions (Table 3); in addition, both samples of viral neuraminidase were less active on this substrate than Vibrio cholrrae

DISCUSSION

any, of free sialic acid yielded with this substrate. The synthetic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-NeuAc was split by all the neur~inida~s of this study (Table 3), with the same hydrolysis rate, respectively, by both bacterial enzymes, and both viral samples. The hydrolysis rate of horse brain gangliosides was highly increased when sodium cholate was added to the mixture of gangliosides (Fig. 4). The results of the degradation of plurisialogangliosides to monosialogangliosides are shown in Fig. 5. Monosialoganglioside GM, was resistant to this viral enzyme, as usual for viral neuraminidases.

The liberation of neuraminidase from the whole virion by bromelain treatment results of the degradation of the enzyme molecules: bromelain treatment releases a proportion of the total amount of neuraminidase which is then set free, but with a small fragment missing; this fragment remains in the outer surface of the treated virion. Ulterior treatment with detergents contributes to dissolve the lipid membrane and releases complete molecules of neuraminidase (and hemagglutinin). The different molecular weight values of the neuraminidase that we have obtained after bromelain and N-lauroyl sarcosine treatments agree with this interpretation. It seems that the enzyme can therefore be obtained under two molecular forms.

It may be deduced that the neurarninidase active centre is greatly resistant to proteoIyti~ agents, since

the enzymic activity remains after this kind of treatment. Nevertheless, this activity is lower than that of the enzyme obtained by using detergents such as N-iauroyisarcosine (see Results). On the other hand, the carbohydrate residues of the neuraminidase perhaps play a protecting role and regulate the stability and degradation of this enzyme as it does for other giycoproteins. The purification of the neuraminidase by eiectrofocusing produced fin our experimental conditions) oniy about 20% of activity loss. Therefore, preparative

electrofocusing may be employed not only as an analytical tool but as a purification procedure also, at least for the neuraminidase of this source. In addition, we have used MeOPhe-NeuAc for the first time as a substrate to measure the neuraminidase activity in the electrofocused fractions. Sucrose or glycerol of the gradients do not interfere with this substrate, as they do in the thiobarbituric acid assay, a common method employed for the determination of the neuraminidase activity. Using MeOP~e-~euAc~ the neuraminidase activity may be determined directly in the fractions, without dialysis (employed for the elimination of the disturbing substances) or radioactivity counting (used in other pracedures). Furthermore, this substrate is not interfered with the ampholytes employed. The pi of the influenza virus neuraminidase has been determined in some virus strains by several authors (Neurath et al., 1970; Gregoriades, 1972; Kendal rt al., 1973; Leavitt ur al., 1979) and significant variation in the pI values of this enzyme has been reported. Neurath et ai. (1970) have described the heterogeneity of p1 for the N2 neuraminidase prepared from the A2/Aichi/68 and B/Mass/66 viruses after treatment with pronase. Kendal PI al. (1973) have also found heterogeneity for the native N2 neuraminidase from Asian (A2/1957) strain (with pI of about 5.2. 5.3, 5.5, 5.8, 6.2 and 6.5) and for its tryptitally digested neuraminidase subunits (PI about 3.6 to 4.4). Leavitt et at, (1979) have also found heterogeneity of pl for the neuraminidase from four strains of influenza virus A (H3N2). In contrast, the same authors (Leavitt er al., 1979) have reported homogeneity (pi = 6.1) for the neuraminidase from thirteen influenza virus A (HlNl) strains and for one A (liZN2) strain (PI = 5.9). Gregoriades (1972f has found to be homogeneous (,pI = 6.0) the Nl neuraminidase derived by nonionic detergents from the WSN virus strain. Some bacterial neuraminidase at least are also homogeneous (Neurath et al.. 1970; Stahl & O'Toote. 1972). To our knowledge, all the above mentioned

GD,, GD,, and GMt as major g&ghosides) (see Reglero et al., 1980); G + B, mixture of horse brain gangliosides + neuraminidase sample B; G + A, mixture of horse brain gangliosides f neuraminidase sample A; GM,. ganglioside standard GM,; NANA, NeuAc released from the ganglioside mixture. All bands were resorcinol purple, except those indicated inside a broken-line rectangle which were yellow-brown coloured, corresponding to asialogangliosides produced in the hydrolysis. Other details are described in the text.

data on the pi belong to neuraminidases obtained by only one procedure. The results that we have found show that the neuraminidase obtained by the two described procedures from the same influenza virus strain exhibits different pi profiles (see Fig. l), which are probably due to the lability of the neuraminidase molecules in the treatments carried out in the separation and purification. The different concentration of some amino acids of both samples (Table 1) is in agreement with this interpretation. Thus, the pI heterogeneity found in some neuraminidases may probably be produced by the treatments employed in the purification of the enzyme. On the other hand, Kendal et al. (1973) consider that the pI heterogeneity might be the result of variable degrees of conformation-dependent variations in the acid-base dissociation of carboxyl groups. This hypothesis does not seem to be in opposition with the results here reported. Furthermore, since influenza and parainfluenza virus giycoproteins do not contain sialic acid (Klenk & Choppin, 1970; Klenk et al., 1970a,b; Palese et al., 1974), their heterogeneity cannot be attributable to the charge due to the variable number of residues of this carbohydrate. The presence of hexosamines which could provide positive charges should require that the amino groups were deacetylated (Raghow et al., 1978; Nakamura &

Compans, 1979). Leavitt et al. (1979) have also suggested that the heterogeneity of the neuraminidase may result from sulfation or modifications such as deamidation or variation in the sites of proteolytic cleavage. We have compared both samples A and B employing several substrates under identical conditions (same sialic acid concentration, pH and incubation time); but, it was not possible to use the same enzyme concentration, since the activities of both samples were very different. We have deduced that both samples A and B split, not only linkages ~2-3 of substrates such as N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose and fetuin, but also linkages ~2-6 which, according to Yoshima et al. (1980), occur in the glycophorin A. Furthermore, the possibility of hydrolysis by both samples A and B of linkages x2--4, which have been found in @,-acid glycoprotein (see Drzeniek, 1974), is not discarded. The activities of both neuraminidase samples are relatively high (Figs 3 & 4) even for lo-min incubation, which is the time that we have usually employed. We have avoided the use of incubation time higher than 90min (exceptionally, the incubation time was 2 hr 30 min for the assays with gangliosides indicated in Fig. 5). Drzeniek (1972. 1974) has outlined that, under prolonged incubation time (24 hr), an excess of viral neuraminidase released a high percentage of the a2-6 or ~2-8 linked NeuAc. Therefore, he recommends (1972) for the studies to use standard conditions such as incubations for 15 min at 37°C. On the other hand, the K, values of both neuraminidase samples of the present work are generally similar to those of other viral neuraminidases (for review, see Drzeniek, 1974; Bucher & Palese, 1975; Rosenberg & Schengrund, 1976). In this work, glycophorin A has been employed as a substrate for a viral neuraminidase and for I/: cholerae and C. pe$:fringen.s neuraminidases; this assay with a viral neuraminidase is probably described for the first time. The hydrolysis rate was lower with neuraminidase sample B than with sample A under the assay conditions (Table 3). Although the role of the neuraminidase in the propagation of the influenza virus is not yet well understood (see Bucher & Palese. 1975; Rosenberg & Schengrund, 1976), it may be deduced from our resuits that the sialic acid of the glycophorin A (which is the predominant sialoglycoprotein of the total glycoprotein fraction in the human erythrocyte membrane, according to Tomita ef a/., 1978) is released by this enzyme. As expected, practically no release of sialic acid from equine submaxillary mucin was detected. The occurrence of 4-0-a~tyl-~-acctylneuraminic acid in this glycoprotein probably abolishes the enzyme activity, as it does with other neuraminidases (Schauer & Faillard, 1968; Veh et al., 1979; Schauer et a[., 1979). The addition of sodium cholate remarkably increased the activities of both samples A and B towards the mixture of gangliosides (Fig. 4) but it had no effect on hydrolysis of GM L (Fig. 5). Similar results have been reported by other authors for other neuraminidases using sodium cholate (Schauer et al., 1980), sodium taurocholate (Wenger & Wardell, 1972) or sodium taurodeoxycholate (Gatt et al., 1980). Finally. Suzuki et ul. (1980) have reported that Senday
