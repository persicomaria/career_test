Abstract A novel 18-metallacrown-6 compound, [Mn6(H2O)6 (abshz)6] ∆ 36H2O (abshz = N-acetyl-5-bromosalicylhydrazide), has been prepared and characterized. The crystal structure contains a neutral 18-membered metallacrown ring which is formed by the succession of six structural moieties of the type [Mn(III)≠N≠N]. Due to the meridional coordination, the ligand enforces the stereochemistry of the Mn3+ ions as a propeller configuration with alternating K/D forms. Antibacterial screening data showed that the complex has strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. ” 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Metallacrowns and its analogies have attracted considerable attention since the first report of metallacrown ether [1]. In the structure, the presence of transition metal ions in the metallacrown ring leads to a class of molecules with features distinct from the simple organic crowns, such as strong visible absorption spectra, redox activity, magnetism, molecular recognition and bioactivity. Metallacrowns have two types of molecules. Among them, one type has a cyclic structure with interlinked [M≠ N≠O] repeat unit, the other has a [M≠N≠N] repeat unit. In the second type of metallacrown, nitrogen atoms replace all oxygen atoms in the cyclic structure, while there is no central metal ion in the center of the ring structure. One, two or three dimensions of networks of metallacrown could be connected via facial interactions and anion bridging [2]. To this day, metallacrowns, with Mn(III), Fe(III), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Ga(III) and V(V)O metal ions, [9MC-3] [3], [12-MC-4] [4≠6], [15-MC-5] [7], [12-MC-6] [8], [16-MC-8] [9], [18-MC-6] [10], [18-MC-8] [8], [30-MC-10] [11], stacking metallacrowns [12] as well as a variety of dimers and fused metallacrowns [5,7,13] have been

reported. Metallacrowns are typically prepared using hydroxamic acids and/or ketonoximic acids as constructing ligands, while suitable organic molecules such as salicylhydrazides [10,11], picoline-tetrazolylamides [14], diethyl ketipinate [15], 3-hydroxy-2-pyridone [16] or 3-thione-1,2dithione-4,5-dithiolato [17] have also been used. In the previous studies, with an attempt to examine the mode of binding and possible antagonistic or synergetic effects, antibacterial screening data showed that 15MCMn(III)N(shi)-5 and 12-MCMn(III)N(shi)-4 metallacrowns are more active than the simple manganese herbicide or carboxylate complexes [18,19]. Taking into account that all the metallacrowns relative to the studies are the type of hydroxamic acids our interest was focused on the type of salicylhydrazides (Scheme 1). In the present paper, we report a new potential pentadentate ligand N-acetyl-5-bromosalicylhydrazidate (1) [20] (H3abshz, Scheme 1) and a novel manganese(III) 18-metallacrown-6 compound, [Mn6(H2O)6 (abshz)6] ∆ 36H2O (2) [21] (Scheme 2). The Ligand H3abshz was synthesized by reacting 5-bromosalicylhydrazide (12.4 g, 50.0 mmol) with acetic anhydride (6.8 g, 66.8 mmol) in 120 mL of chloroform at 0 ∞C, then slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred for 8 h. After staying for overnight at

refrigerator, the resulting white precipitate was filtered and rinsed with chloroform and diethyl ether. H3abshz (0.27 g, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in 100 mL methanol, and 0.20 g (1.0 mmol) of MnCl2 ∆ 4H2O (0.20 g, 1.0 mmol) in 10 mL 50% methanol was added. The mixture was stirred for 10 min, then the solution was adjusted to pH 4≠5 with 1% sodium hydroxide. The resulting dark brown solution was filtered. After standing for a week, dark brown block crystals were obtained from the filtrate. In the IR spectra, the ligand 1 shows stretching bands attributed to C@O, C@N, C≠OH (phenolic) and NH at 1659, 1641, 1126 and 1178, and 3181 cm¿1, respectively [22]. Bands at 3302, 2932 and 2683 cm¿1 are assigned to t(O≠H) vibrations which may be involving intramolecular hydrogen bonding, while band at 1126 and 1178 cm¿1 is attributed to t(O≠H) (phenolic) [23,24]. In addition, a strong band found at 1597 cm¿1 is assigned to CANAN @C group [22≠24]. In the title compound 2, the absence of the N≠H and C@O stretching vibration bands is consistent with the deprotonation of the CONH groups and coordination to the Mn(III) ion. The broad band at 3415 cm¿1 is reasonably assigned to OH stretching vibrations, and the band is attributable to coordinated H2O molecules [25]. The disappearance of the bands at 3302, 2932 and 2683 cm¿1 and the appearance of the bands at 1305 and 1234 cm¿1 support the involvement of phenolic oxygen in coordination through deprotonation. This is confirmed by the band at about 458 cm¿1 assigned to Mn≠O (phenolic). The title compound 2 crystallizes in the Rhombohedral system and space group R-3 c [26]. A diagram of the crystal structure of complex 2 is presented in Fig. 1. The structure exhibits a hexanuclear ring of manganese atoms linked by six hydrazide N≠N groups. The deprotonated ligand abshz3¿ acts as a trianionic pentadentate ligand, one phenolate oxygen, one carbonyl oxygen and one hydrazide

nitrogen in the ligand are bound to one Mn3+ cation, and the other carbonyl oxygen plus the other hydrazide nitrogen in the same ligand are chelated to an adjacent Mn3+ cation. Therefore, the ligand is forcing all Mn3+ cations into a propeller configuration with alternating K/D stereochemistry as DKD or KDK forms (Fig. 1). The two faces of the disc-shaped hexanuclear ring have opposite chiralities to each other. This organization results in the 18-membered hexanuclear core ring system with an [≠Mn≠N≠N≠] repeat unit. The approximate dimensions of ∞ the oval-shaped cavity are about 6.757 A in diameter at ∞ at its diameter at the center of the cavity. entrance, 9.543 A It is also observed that all atoms in the ligand are almost in co-plane and the all manganese atoms in title compound 2 are in an octahedral MnN2O4 environment. The average ∞ neighboring Mn¡ ¡ ¡Mn separation is of 4.869 A. There are 36 of solvent water molecules, with the presence of disordered lattice, around the cavity of metallacrown in the title compound. But there are not any solvent molecules in the `host' cavity of metallacrown. Besides, there are intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the O≠H group from coordinated water and the oxygen atom from solvent water. The O≠H¡ ¡ ¡O hydrogen bond distances range from ∞ 1.783(19) to 3.240(15) A. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of the complexes 1 and 2 against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus vulgaris are listed in Table 1. As can clearly be seen from Table 1, both compounds do not indicate specificity against Gram-positive or Gramnegative bacteria in spite of it is generally expected that a much greater number would be active against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria [27]. While compound 1 has formed relatively weak antimicrobial effect against all tested microorganisms, compound 2 has showed the most

potent antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli and B. subtilis. Similar anti-microbial behavior (MIC = 50≠ 100 lg/mL) has been previously reported for other metallacrowns [18,19]. However, comparison of the MIC values did not suggest that an increase in the metallacrown ring size case results in increased antimicrobial activity. In summary, one new 18-metallacrown-6 2 compounds containing Mn3+ as ring ions with the ligand of 1 have been synthesized and structurally characterized. Due to the meridional coordination of the ligand to the Mn3+ ion, the ligand enforces the stereochemistry of the Mn3+ ions as a propeller configuration with alternating K/D forms. The other important structural feature in [Mn6(H2O)6 (abshz)6] ∆ 36H2O is that there is not only a vacant cavity in the center of 18-metallacrown-6 core ring, but also the opposite chiralities on the two faces of the metallacrown ring system. This novel manganese 18-metallacrown-6 compound has shown strong antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, E. coli and B. subtilis.
