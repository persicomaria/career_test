Structure of Yeast Poly(A) Polymerase Alone and in Complex with 3 -dATP
Joel Bard,1 Alexander M. Zhelkovsky,2 Steffen Helmling,2 Thomas N. Earnest,3 Claire L. Moore,2 Andrew Bohm1,4*
Polyadenylate [poly(A)] polymerase (PAP) catalyzes the addition of a polyadenosine tail to almost all eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The crystal structure of the PAP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Pap1) has been solved to 2.6 angstroms, both alone and in complex with 3 -deoxyadenosine triphosphate (3 -dATP). Like other nucleic acid polymerases, Pap1 is composed of three domains that encircle the active site. The arrangement of these domains, however, is quite different from that seen in polymerases that use a template to select and position their incoming nucleotides. The first two domains are functionally analogous to polymerase palm and fingers domains. The third domain is attached to the fingers domain and is known to interact with the single-stranded RNA primer. In the nucleotide complex, two molecules of 3 -dATP are bound to Pap1. One occupies the position of the incoming base, prior to its addition to the mRNA chain. The other is believed to occupy the position of the 3 end of the mRNA primer. Polyadenylation provides a universal handle by which transport and translation machinery can recognize and physically manipulate mRNAs. In eukaryotic organisms, addition of the poly(A) tail facilitates the transport of

mRNA from the nucleus (1) and helps regulate mRNA stability (2). Interactions between proteins bound to the poly(A) tail and the 5 end of mRNA in the cytoplasm are thought to cause circularization of the message and increase the efficiency of translation (3). Polyadenylation of mRNA is also observed in prokaryotes and appears to facilitate mRNA degradation (4). Poly(A) tails are formed by a multiprotein complex which recognizes a polyadenylation signal at the 3 end of a nascent transcript and cleaves the precursor RNA. PAP then adds the poly(A) tail [reviewed in (5)]. PAPs are well conserved across phyla with the first 400 amino acids showing considerable se-

quence identity (6). The catalytic function of PAP resides in its NH2-terminal domain (7), which shows sequence similarity to members of the nucleotidyl transferase (NT) family that includes DNA polymerase (Pol ), CCA-adding enzymes, and several bacterial antibiotic resistance enzymes (8). Pap1 retains polymerase activity when separated from the holoenzyme assembly and can processively add long stretches of adenosine nucleotides to an RNA primer in vitro. Although it employs the same catalytic mechanism as other nucleic acid polymerases, PAP is significantly different in that it does not utilize a template strand to select and position the incoming nucleotide. We have determined the the structure of both the apo and 3 -dATP­ bound states of a Pap1 truncation mutant ( 10PAP), which contains the NH2-terminal 537 of the 568 amino acids in wild-type Pap1 (9). This truncated enzyme exhibits wild-type activity in vitro and is capable of rescuing an otherwise lethal disruption of the yeast PAP1 gene (10). Crystals formed from 10PAP contain two copies of Pap1 in the asymmetric unit cell (ASU). The structure was first solved to 3.2 Å by selenomethionine multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD), and later refined against higher resolution data sets with and without 3 -dATP and divalent cations soaked into the crystals (Table 1) (11). At first glance, Pap1 looks like many other polymerases. A large 20 Å by 30 Å by 45 Å cleft is bounded by three globular domains (Fig. 1). In other polymerases, this arrangement has been likened to a hand in which the substrates are held between the thumb and fingers and presented to an active site in the palm (Fig. 1, inset) (12). Pap1 differs from these polymerases, however, in that the

thumb domain is missing. The catalytic palm domain forms a wall of the cleft rather than sitting at its base. The base of the cleft interacts with the phosphates of the incoming nucleotide and is therefore functionally analogous to the fingers domains of other polymerases (13). The COOH-terminal domain forms the other wall of the cleft. Specificity determinants near the NH2- and COOH-termini of 10PAP are known to interact with other components of the 3 end processing machinery (14). These regions are on opposite sides of the structure, consistent with biochemical evidence that they function independently in regulating Pap1 activity. The palm domain of Pap1 is structurally similar to the palms of other members of the NT family of proteins (15, 16). Three conserved acidic residues (aspartates 100, 102, and 154) coordinate the two metal ions required for catalysis. These metal ions and the incoming nucleotide are clearly visible in difference maps calculated using the native data and data from crystals soaked in 3 dATP and either MgCl2 or MnCl2 (Fig. 2A) (17). The positions of the metal ions and phosphates correspond well with those observed in the active complex of Pol (Fig. 2C) (15). Although the metals and phosphates exhibit very strong electron density, that of the ribose and base is weaker, suggesting that these parts of the substrate may be flexible (18). We also observe electron density consistent with the presence of the sugar and base of a second 3 -dATP molecule (Fig. 2, A and B). Like that of the incoming nucleotide, the position of this density is very similar in both crystallographically independent copies of the complex. The second nucleotide occupies the position where the 3 end of the primer would be expected based on the Pol structure. The bases of the two nucleotides do not appear to stack, but are close enough to allow hydrogen bonding between N6 of the primer and N3 of the incoming nucleotide. This interaction does not, however, satisfactorily explain the selectivity of Pap1 for ATP as the incoming nucleotide (14). In other polymerases, formation of a correct base pair between the incoming nucleotide and the template is only detected in the "closed" conformation of the palm and fingers domains (19). It may be that Pap1 adopts a similar closed conformation during the catalytic cycle. Slight rotation of the fingers domain relative to the palm (see below) could place the conserved residue N226 within hydrogen bonding distance of the adenosine-specific N6 atom of the incoming nucleotide (20). In contrast to the incoming nucleotide triphosphate, the mononucleotide primer shows extensive interactions with Pap1 (Fig. 2, D and E). The base of the primer 3 -dATP molecule stacks against the functionally important residue V141 (21). When the palm domains of Pap1 and Pol are superimposed, Pap1 F140, which sits at the apex of the -hairpin containing V141, occupies the same position as the 1 nucleotide of the Pol template DNA. This -hairpin may thus serve to compensate for the absence of a template in binding and positioning the primer. In addition, a hydrogen bond between the N6 amino group of the primer base and the main chain carbonyl of R186 could select for adenine over guanine. The fingers domains of other polymerases

Residues 445 to 456 and 473 to 478, which were not modeled in molecule B are based on the equivalent residues from molecule A. Two divalent cations (orange) are shown bound to the active site and to the phosphates of the incoming 3 -dATP (red). The mononucleotide primer is shown in yellow. The residues which form each secondary structure element are listed in a table adjacent to each subdomain. A model of T7 DNA polymerase [1T7P (36)] is shown in the inset for comparison. The color scheme for the palm and fingers domain is similar to that of Pap1. All figures were generated using three programs in sequence: MOLSCRIPT (37), R3D_TO_POV, and PovRAY.

rotate upon formation of the catalytic ternary complex with primer and NTP (19). Although we see no large-scale differences between the apo and the nucleotide-bound structures of Pap1, the two crystallographically independent molecules differ by 5° in the orientation of the palm relative to the fingers. Interactions between the fingers domain and the incoming nucleotide are strongly affected by this rotation. In molecule B, Y224 and K215 are quite close to the incoming 3 -dATP, with the -phosphate and K215 coordinating a water molecule (Fig. 2E). Molecule A, however, is in a more open conformation, and Y224 and K215 instead appear to interact with pyrophosphate (22), the by-product of the polymerase reaction (Fig. 2, A and D). K215 may therefore function to neutralize the pyrophosphate anion after catalysis. It has been proposed that similarly positioned lysines assume an analogous role in Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (23) and T7 DNA polymerase (24). The COOH-terminal domain of Pap1 binds the RNA primer/product. Residues 525 to 537 define a COOH-terminal RNA binding site (C-RBS) which is required for Pap1 processivity and for ultraviolet cross-linking to the upstream region of the RNA primer (10, 14). The C-RBS of Pap1 appears to be flexible, and we cannot model the electron density beyond residues 523 and 530 in molecules A and B, respectively (25). Those residues of the C-RBS which have been modeled extend away from the cleft, perhaps explaining why cross-linking to the Pap1 CRBS is not observed when RNA is labeled only at its 3 end (10). There is considerable structural homology between the COOH-terminal domain and a number of nucleic acid binding proteins, including ribosomal protein S6 (26), and members of the RRM family of single-stranded RNA binding proteins (27). The strongest similarity was to S6 where the C atoms of 70 residues may be superimposed with an rmsd of 2.5 Å (Fig. 3A). The face of S6 which binds the 16S RNA is analogous to the outside surface of Pap1, near the C-RBS. A group of conserved basic residues comprising K513 and a KKEK sequence in the loop preceding helix Q is also located in this region, suggesting that this part of the molecule may also play a role in RNA binding. Although the shortest path between the active site and the C-RBS involves the RNA exiting the cleft from the front of the molecule (as viewed in Fig. 1), we have repeatedly observed weak electron density extending from the active site toward the rear of the cleft when short oligonucleotides are soaked into the crystals. A model in which the RNA exits from the rear of the cleft and wraps around to the C-RBS must therefore also be considered, particularly since the rear of the cleft is both more highly conserved and more basic than the front (Fig. 3B). Regardless of which path the RNA takes, binding of the poly(A) product to the inside face of the COOH-terminal domain could allow movements relative to the palm to disengage the RNA from the active site, as would be expected during translocation after addition of a new adenosine residue. Such movements of the COOH-terminal domain would occur as a result of the rotation of the attached fingers domain during catalysis. Additional binding at the C-RBS would then maintain processivity while allowing the translocated product to be released from the inside face of the COOH-terminal domain as the new 3 end of the primer assumes its position for the next round of catalysis.

Although PAPs are more active and less selective in the presence of Mn2 , no significant differences between the MgCl2- and MnCl2-soaked crystals were seen at this resolution. The structure presented here has been refined against the MnCl2 data because these data were of better quality. The identity of the manganese sites was confirmed by examining anomalous difference Fourier maps. 18. Initial difference Fourier maps were unclear about the orientation of the base. Refinement using a betaversion of BUSTER (35) showed the orientation of the base clearly.

Untagged PAP was expressed and purified essentially as described (10), with the exception that the published heparin purification step was replaced with a Source S (Pharmacia) chromatography step. The peak fractions were concentrated to 40 mg/ml using a finger dialysis concentrator (Schleicher & Shuell, Keene, NH), exchanged into 75 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate ( pH 6.8), 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DT T), and 20% glycerol and stored at ­ 80°C, prior to crystallization. Typical yields of pure protein from this procedure were 1.2 mg/liter of E. coli culture for the full-length PAP, and 2.2 mg/liter culture for the 10 truncation. Selenomethionine was incorporated into the protein using an auxotrophic strain of E. coli into which the pLysS plasmid had been transformed and M9 growth media in which selenomethionine replaced methionine. The purification of the selenomethionine-incorporated protein was identical to that described above, however, the yield was significantly lower. PAP was crystallized at 4°C by vapor diffusion in hanging drops over wells containing 13.5% ethylene glycol, 9% PEG 8K, 6% glycerol, 100 mM Hepes ( pH 7.24), and 2 mM DT T. The crystallization drops contained equal volumes of well solution and concentrated protein. Although full-length, bacterially-produced Pap1 is soluble to at least 35 mg/ml, it does not form crystals, and from dynamic light scattering measurements, it appears to be significantly aggregated. Crystals of Pap1 were initially grown using a 25­amino acid COOH-terminal deletion of the full length protein generated with endoproteinase Glu-C. The endoproteases Lys-C, thermolysin, and chymotrypsin produced similar fragments, suggesting that the COOH-terminus of Pap1 is intrinsically flexible. To improve the reproducibility of crystallization and quality of diffraction, data was collected from crystals formed from a previously characterized truncation of Pap1, 10PAP. 10. A. M.

Data from the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL) beamline 19-ID was processed with HKL2000. Rotating anode data was processed with XDS (30). Eight of the 16 selenium positions were found by SOLVE (31), and the remaining sites were found by difference Fourier methods using solvent flattened phases derived from the initial selenium sites. Phase refinement was initially done using G. Van Duyne's GVX suite. Later, SHARP (32) was used to improve the quality of the selenomethionine MAD maps. The model was built using O (33) and refined using the simulated annealing torsion angle refinement protocol in CNS (34). 12. D. L. Ollis, P. Brick, R. Hamlin, N. G. Xuong, T. A.

Differential Clustering of CD4 and CD3 During T Cell Recognition
Matthew F. Krummel,1 Michael D. Sjaastad,2 Christoph Wulfing,1* Mark M. Davis1 ¨
Whereas T helper cells recognize peptide­major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II complexes through their T cell receptors (TCRs), CD4 binds to an antigen-independent region of the MHC. Using green fluorescent protein­ tagged chimeras and three-dimensional video microscopy, we show that CD4 and TCR-associated CD3 cluster in the interface coincident with increases in intracellular calcium. Signaling-, costimulation-, and cytoskeleton-dependent processes then stabilize CD3 in a single cluster at the center of the interface, while CD4 moves to the periphery. Thus, the CD4 coreceptor may serve primarily to "boost" recognition of ligand by the TCR and may not be required once activation has been initiated. In higher vertebrates, T lymphocytes systematically scan cells and tissues for non-self antigens embedded in molecules of the MHC.

ognition of these peptide-MHC complexes is achieved through the TCR, and signal transduction occurs through phosphorylation of the tightly associated CD3 , , , and polypeptides (1). Several receptors on T cells can potentiate the response of the T cell, and their engagement is often required for successful activation in vivo. One of these is CD4 on T helper cells, which binds to relatively invariant sites on MHC class II molecules outside the peptide-binding groove (2, 3) and accumulates at the T cell­antigen-presenting cell (APC) interface (4). During activation, CD4 increases T
