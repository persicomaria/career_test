Abstract
We studied the transition metal ion requirements for activity and sulfhydryl group reactivity in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-carboxykinase; ATP:oxaloacetate carboxylase (transphosphorylating), EC 4.1.1.49), a key enzyme in the energy metabolism of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi. As for other PEP-carboxykinases this enzyme has a strict requirement of transition metal ions for activity, even in the presence of excess Mg 2+ ions for the carboxylation reaction; the order of effectiveness of these ions as enzyme activators was: Co2+> Mn2+> Cd2+> Ni 2+ >> Fe2+> VO 2+, while Zn 2+ and Ca 2+ had no activating effects. When we investigated the effect of varying the type or concentration of the transition metal ions on the kinetic parameters of the enzyme the results suggested that the stimulatory effects of the transition metal center were mostly associated with the activation of the relatively inert CO 2 substrate. The inhibitory effects of 3-mercaptopicolinic acid (3MP) on the enzyme were found to depend on the transition metal ion activator: for the Mn 2+-activated enzyme the inhibition was purely non-competitive (Kii = Kis) towards all substrates, while for the CoZ+-activated enzyme the inhibitor was much less effective, produced a mixed-type inhibition and affected differentially the interaction of the enzyme with its substrates. The modification of a single, highly reactive, cysteine per enzyme molecule by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) lead to an almost complete inhibition of MnZ+-activated T. cruzi PEP-carboxykinase; however, in contrast with the results of previous studies in vertebrate and yeast enzymes, the substrate ADP slowed the chemical modification and enzyme inactivation but did not prevent it. PEP and HCO 3 had no significant effect on the rate or extent of the enzyme inactivation. The kinetics of the enzyme inactivation by DTNB was also dependent on the transition metal activator, being much slower for the C02+-activated enzyme than for its Mn 2+-activated counterpart. When the bulkier but more hydrophobic reagent N-(7-dimethylamino-4methylcoumarinyl)maleimide(DACM) was used the enzyme was slowly and incompletely inactivated in the presence of Mn 2+ and ADP afforded almost complete protection from inactivation; in the presence of Co 2+ the enzyme was completely resistant to inactivation. Taken together, our results indicate that the parasite enzyme has a specific requirement of transition metal ions for activity and that they modulate the reactivity of a single, essential thiol group, different from the hyperreactive cysteines present in vertebrate or yeast enzymes.

lating], EC 4.1.1.49) is a key enzyme in the intermediary metabolism of parasitic trypanosomatids such as Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, and several Leishmania species where it catalyzes and regulates the catabolic breakdown of amino acids and carbohydrates according to the cell's energy requirements and substrate availability [1-3]. This role contrasts with the well-known gluconeogenic function of the GTP-dependent enzymes (EC 4.1.1.32) in vertebrates [4-7]. The protozoan enzyme has been purified to homogeneity and its kinetic and regulatory properties characterized [8] as

well as its inhibition by 3-mercaptopicolinic acid (3MP) in vitro and in vivo [9]. From these studies it was concluded that the parasite enzyme presents distinct differences with its homologue of the vertebrate host in terms of substrate specificity's, allosteric regulation by ATP [8] and sensitivity to 3MP. Consistent with these conclusions, the recent cloning of the gene coding for the enzyme in T. cruzi epimastigotes and the comparison of its predicted primary and secondary structures with those from several sources showed that ATP and GTP-dependent PEPCK's have very little structural similarity [10], which suggested a case of convergent evolution. A dual requirement of Mg 2+ at milimolar concentrations (presumably required to form a nucleotide chelate) and micromolar concentrations of transition metal ions for the activity of vertebrate's PEPCK is well documented [4,11-16]. A similar type of requirement has been found for ATP-dependent PEPCK's such as the yeast [17], T. cruzi [8] and bacterial [1:8] enzymes but no information on the activation mechanism was available in these cases. The presence of reactive sulfhydryl groups in vertebrate (GTP-dependent) and yeast (ATP-dependent) PEPCK's has received considerable attention and the reactive cysteine groups have been identified in the primary sequence of the respective proteins [19-28]. However, the precise role of these residues on the structure or catalytic mechanism of PEPCK still is poorly understood. Thus, for the chicken mitochondrial enzyme magnetic resonance studies concluded that the hyperreactive cysteine located near the nucleotide binding region is too remote from the active site to fulfill an active role in substrate binding or catalysis [23]. Similarly, the equivalent residue in the yeast enzyme (Cys-364) is absent t!he homologous ATP-dependent PEPCK's from T. brucei [29] or T. cruzi [10] enzymes suggesting again that it is not essential for substrate binding or catalysis. In the present study we found that the transition metal ion requirement for activiity in T. cruzi PEPCK differs both qualitatively and quantitatively from that reported for the vertebrate, yeast and bacterial enzymes. Furthermore, we found that this enzyme also contains contain a single reactive cysteine group 'whose modification lead to complete loss of activity but whose properties differ from those described for the above mentioned enzymes; the reactivity of this thiol group is strongly dependent on the transition metal ion activator. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials All chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, FRG), Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA) and Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and were of the highest purity available. Chelex 100 is a product of Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA, USA) and 3MP (SK&F 34288) of

SmithKline Beecham (King of Prussia, PA) the latter was obtained from SmithKline Beecham de Venezuela (Caracas, Venezuela). 2.2. Culture methods T. cruzi epimastigotes (EP stock) were cultivated in liver infusion-tryptose (LIT) medium at 28°C, with constant shaking as described before [30]. 2.3. Isolation, purification and assay of PEP-carboxykinase The enzyme was isolated and purified as described previously [8]. Routine SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that it was > 95% pure; in the present experiments the inclusion of 10 /~g/ml of leupeptin (Sigma) in the purification procedure led to a consistent subunit molecular mass of ca. 60 kDa instead of the 42 kDa previously reported [8]. Its activity was assayed for the PEP-carboxylation reaction at 25°C by coupling the production of oxaloacetate to NADH oxidation in the presence of malate dehydrogenase [8,31]. The latter was followed in a diodearray Hewlett-Packard 8452A UV-Vis spectrophotometer under the control of a HP 386 Q S / 1 6 S computer. A typical assay mixture contained 1 mM ADP, 2 mM PEP, 20 mM HCO 3, 50 mM Pipes, 90 mM KC1, 3 mM MgC12, 666 /zM of the transition metal activator, 500 /zM EGTA, 1 mM /3-mercaptoethanol, 200 /zM NADH, 5 units/ml of malic dehydrogenase and 0.085-0.42/~M ~ ( 5 - 2 5 / z g / m l ) of T. cruzi PEPCK (pH 7.0). No effects of the PEPCK inhibitor 3MP were detected on the coupling enzyme up to the highest concentration used (300 /zM). In the study of the effects of different transition metals on the enzyme activity (in the presence of excess Mg 2÷) all solutions of substrates, cofactors and coupling enzyme were prepared in Pipes buffer which had been passed through a Chelex 100 column to remove contaminating transition metal ions; also, pure PEPCK was concentrated by precipitation with 90% ammonium sulfate and desalted by passing it through a Sephadex G-25M column with 2 cm of Chelex 100 resin on top. In the assays the enzyme activity was recorded in the absence of any added transition metal ions, then the test ion was added and the initial reaction rate was recorded within 10 s, using the assay medium described above without EGTA. It was found in all cases that the reaction was linear with time for at least 4 min. 2.4.

I Although the original report of the cloning and sequencing of the pepck geni in T. cruzi [10] predicted a molecular mass of 52.5 kDa, a revised sequence has since then been obtained wich predicts a 58.9 kDa molecular mass (ref. [32] and Linss et al., unpublished corrected sequence deposited in GenBank under the accession number M91163) and this value has been used in all calculations done in this work.

the substrate HCO 3 (CO 2) was lowest due to the relatively large value of K app. We also investigated the dependence of these kinetic parameters as a function of the concentration the transition metal ion activator Mn 2+. Table 3 gives the kinetic parameters of the enzyme in the carboxylation reaction at three different concentrations of the activator ion, in the presence of excess Mg 2+. It can be seen that variation the transition metal activator concentration from 15 to 150 /xM (which is the range of the apparent Kam for Mn 2+, see Table 1) produced only pp moderate effects on Vapp with no significant effects on K app when the variable substrates were ADP and PEP, while for HCO 3 we observed a significant reduction in K app and a corresponding increase in Vavp, which accounted for the effects of the activator on the overall reaction (Table 1). 3.3. Inhibition effects of 3MP on T. cruzi PEPCK and their dependence on the transition metal ion activator Table 4 show that 3MP, a potent and specific inhibitor of PEPCK's from different origins [9,36,37] acted as a

pure non-competitive (Kii=Ki~) inhibitor for all substrates of the carboxylation reaction for the Mn2+-activated T. cruzi PEPCK, in agreement with a previous report [9]. However, for the C02+-activated enzyme the inhibitor was much less effective and produced a mixed-type inhibition. For PEP and HCO 3 (CO 2) its lower potency could be explained by a large value of the enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constant (Ki~ >> Kii), leading to a predominantly Vm effect, while that for ADP the poor inhibitor activity is due to the large value of the (enzyme-substrate)-inhibitor dissociation c o n s t a n t (Kii > K i s ) , giving a predominantly K m effect. 3.4. Effects of sulfl~ydryl-modifying reagents on T. cruzi PEPCK activity and their dependence on the transitionmetal ion actiiJator We have previously shown that sulfhydryl-modifying reagents are potent inhibitors of T. cruzi PEPCK activity [8].

The enzyme in the absence of substrates was very rapidly inactivated, reaching 50% of its original activity in approx. 1.5 min. The presence of saturating (1 raM) concentrations ADP slowed the inhibitory effect of DTNB but did not prevent it: the time required to reach 50% of the basal activity increased tenfold but after 60 min :80% of the activity was lost. On the other hand, the combined presence PEP and HCO 3 (at 2 and 20 mM, respectively) did not protect the enzyme from inactivation, as the time required to reach 50% of the original activity and the residual activity after 60 min were not significantly different from those obtained with the

It can also be seen that the inactivation process in the absence of substrates or in the presence of 2 mM PEP plus 20 mM HCO 3 had an initial rapid phase which accounted for the loss of 90% of

For the Co2+-activated enzyme (Fig. 2, top panel) the kinetics of the inactivation process in the absence of substrates was slower (ca. 9-fold) than that for its Mn2+-activated counterpart, and both in this condition and in the presence of 1 mM ADP a single inactivation process was observed, which correlated with the modification of only one sulfhydryl group per enzyme molecule (Fig. 2, bottom panel and Table 4). In the presence of 2 mM PEP plus 20 mM HCO 3 the inactivation process was faster and a biphasic process was again observed. When we studied the modification of the enzyme by the

bulkier but more hydrophobic reagent DACM at a concentration two-fold higher than that of the enzyme, we found that the inactivation process induced by this compound in the Mn 2+-activated enzyme was slower than that observed with DTNB but had the same biphasic character (Fig. 3 and Table 5), while for the Co2+-activated enzyme no significant inactivation was observed after 60 min of incubation. It was found that in this case the presence of the ADP at 1 mM was able to protect almost completely the Mn2+-activated enzyme from inactivation while PEP and HCO 3 (at 2 and 20 mM, respectively) provided no significant protection (Table 5); neither substrate modified the complete stability of the Co2+-activated enzyme against inactivation by DACM. In all cases the activity of the enzyme in the absence of sulfhydryl-modifying reagents did not changed significantly (less than 10% reduction) during the observation period.

4. Discussion The dual requirement of Mg 2+ and a transition metal ion, demonstrated by the synergistic effects of these ions on the enzyme activity is a property shared by all known PEPCK's (refs. [4,8,11-18] and the present work) except for the Escherichia coli enzyme, where the second activating cation is Ca 2+, Mn 2+ being ineffective [38]. There are, however important differences, both qualitative and quanti-

tative, in the activating effects of transition metal ions on the carboxylation reaction catalyzed by the T. cruzi and vertebrate enzymes. First, Fe 2+, which is, together with Mn 2÷, the best activator of vertebrate enzymes [11,12,16] is almost totally ineffeclive in parasite's PEPCK; it must be stressed that in our assays the enzyme activity was measured within seconds of the addition of the transition metal ion, to avoid possible oxidative damage of the enzyme produced by free radicals arising from the autooxidation of the divalent cations, notably Fe 2+ [16]. Second, it is noteworthy the low relative affinity of the parasite enzyme for Mn ?'÷, as the measured value for its apparent K m were one order of magnitude higher than those reported for the vertebrate enzymes (see Table 1 and refs. [11-16,39,40]). Third, the best activator of the parasite enzyme in vitro is Co 2÷ as a consequence of its high affinity for the enzyme (low K m) and high V leading to a m catalytic efficiency 100--fold higher than that of Mn 2÷ (Table 1). In the vertebrate enzymes Co 2÷ ions activate with a catalytic efficie~acy comparable or significantly inferior to that of Mn 2÷ under similar conditions [12,13]. The results of the experiments aimed to investigate the effects of the type and concentration of the transition metal ion on the kinetic properties of the enzyme (Tables 2 and 3) indicated than the activation of T. cruzi PEPCK by transition metal ions is mediated mostly through the activation of the relatively inert substrate CO: and, to a lesser extent, of PEP. Similar results have been obtained for the GTP-dependent PEPCK from rat liver cytosol where the transition metal ions modify drastically the kinetic parameters (particularly Vm ) for the carboxylation reaction, which requires the activation of CO 2, but not for the decarboxylation process [11,12]. However, for the chicken liver mitochondria enzyme the variation of the transition metal activator modified K m but not Vm towards PEP [13]. The proposition that the transition metal ion is mostly involved in the activation of CO 2 and PEP is also supported by the differential inhibitory effects of 3MP depending on which substrate is varied and the transition metal activator present (Table 4): again, towards CO 2 and PEP the inhibitory action differed from that towards ADP. These differential effects are probably mediated by the electronic properties of the active site a n d / o r conformational changes induced in the enzyme by the transition metal ion. The occurrence of conformational changes in T. cruzi PEPCK associated with the replacement of the transition metal ion activator could also be inferred from the different reactivity of sulfhydryl groups in the Mn 2+ and Co2+-activated enzymes (Figs. 1-3; see below). The role of the transition metal ion (particularly Mn 2+ ) in the reaction mechanism catalyzed by PEPCK's has been investigated by several authors, using steady-state kinetics and magnetic resonance methods and it has been generally concluded that the transition metal ion serves to catalyze the phosphoryl transfer from the PEP to the nucleotide acceptor [39-42]. Howew~r, the evidence for direct coordi-

nation of the phosphoryl groups by Mn2+is not unequivocal: thus, although Miller et al. [39] proposed a direct interaction of these atoms with the coordination sphere of the Mn 2+ ion, more detailed inter atomic distance measurements obtained by Nowak's group [40-42] indicated only outer sphere complexes for both PEP and ADP. However, other possible roles for the transition metal ion in the catalytic mechanism of PEPCK could be envisaged: activation of CO2 by transition metal centers is a wellknown chemistry [43] and in particular its reactions with unsaturated substrates have been studied by several authors and may be rationalized in terms of electrocyclic transformations with heterocyclic intermediates containing the metal ion in the ring [43-46]. If a mechanism of this type underlies the catalytic activity of PEPCK's, CO 2 (through its electrophilic carbon or its C = O bond system) and PEP (trough its olefinic region) would be the substrates directly associated to the coordination sphere of the transition metal ion and this could be tested experimentally. The results of the experiments with sulfhydryl modifying reagents show that in T. cruzi PEPCK the modification of a single cysteine group of high reactivity (out of 10 present in the primary structure of the protein, see refs. [10] and [32]) is enough to reduce the enzyme activity by > 90%. This result is similar to that obtained with both the vertebrate (GTP-dependent) and yeast (ATP-dependent) enzymes [19-28]. However, one important difference is that in all the above mentioned studies the presence of saturating concentrations (1 mM) of the nucleoside diphosphate substrate (IDP or ADP) completely protected the enzymes from both chemical modification and inactivation while in the case of T. cruzi PEPCK this substrate slowed the inactivation process for the Mn2+-activated enzyme but did not prevent it. Also the hydrophobic but bulky reagent DACM, which rapidly inactivates the rat enzyme (100% inactivation in < 10 min under conditions comparable to our experiments, see ref. [20]) produces a much slower and incomplete inactivation of T. cruzi PEPCK. These different behaviors can be explained by the fact that the cysteine residue modified in the parasite's enzyme is most probably distinct from the reactive group in other PEPCK's: thus, the single hyperreactive cysteine in the vertebrate enzymes (Cys-288 in rat liver enzyme, see refs. [20,22] and Cys-273 in chicken mitochondrial enzyme, see refs. [23,47]) is present in a highly conserved region found in the primary structure of all GTP-dependent PEPCK's but absent from ATP-dependent enzymes [10]. On the other hand, the reactive cysteine in yeast PEPCK is Cys-364, which is found in a consensus region of the primary sequence of ATP-dependent PEPCK's associated to the adenine binding site [27,28]; however this cysteine residue is one of the non-conserved amino acids in this region and is absent from both the T. cruzi [10] and the T. brucei [29] enzymes. Current work is aimed at the precise identification of the reactive residue on the primary structure of the T. cruzi protein. In any case, it is noteworthy the strong depen-

dence of the reactivity of this residue on the type of transition metal activator present, being much smaller in the C02+-activated enzyme. This could indicate that this residue is directly involved in the transition metal binding site or that the binding of the metal activator induces conformational changes in the enzyme which modify the accessibility of the residue to the modifying reagents as suggested by Colombo et al. [12] for the rat liver enzyme. In conclusion, our results indicate that the requirement of transition metal ions for the activity of T. cruzi PEPCK is mostly related to the activation of CO 2 in the carboxylation reaction and that they modify the chemical properties of a single hyperreactive cysteine group present in the protein. These properties resemble those of previously described PEPCK's; however, the parasite enzyme has qualitative differences in their transition metal ion requirements and sulfhydryl group reactivity with its vertebrate (GTP-dependent) counterparts which could reflect important structural differences between the two type of enzymes. This conclusion agrees with the results derived from the comparison of the predicted primary and secondary structures of these proteins [10].
