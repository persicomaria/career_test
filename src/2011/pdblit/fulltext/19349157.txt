STRUCTURAL INFLUENCES OF STYRYL-BASED INHIBITORS ON EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR AND ~56'~~ TYROSINE-SPECIFIC PROTEIN KINASES. Terrence R. Burke, Jr.*' Zhen-Hong Li, 2,3Joseph B.

Summary: Astructure activity study was conducted on two important members of the styryl class of tyrosine-specific protein kmase inhibitors to examine relative roles which the aryl rings and vinyl side chains play in their inhibitory activity. The ability of four analo s (la-d) to inhibit au! tophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ~56'~ tyrosine kinases was examined, with results showing that both the pattern of aromatic hydroxylation and the type of side chain functionality can greatly influence both selectivity and potency. Tyrosine-specific protein kinases (TPKs) constitute an important class of phosphoryl transfer enzymes which serve vital regulatory functions in cellular growth and differentiation.' In view of the fact that several TPKs are the products of proto-oncogenes, inhibitors of these kinases offer a potential approach toward the treatment of various proliferative disorders. Since the isolation of erbstatin la from a culture of Strepromyces2 and the demonstration of its potent inhibitory properties in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) TPK (IC,, = 3 CLM)~ large number of a inhibitors bearing general structure 1 have been reported.4-16These styrene-containing compounds are generally competitive with respect to substrate and can be envisioned to function at the catalytic Studies which have shown the imporsite as peptidomimetics of tyrosine-containing peptides. 17*r8 tance of aromatic hydroxyl groups for inhibitory activity in this class of compounds" support the hypothesis that the aryl ring mimics features of the 4-hydroxyphenyl ring of tyrosine itself while the vinylic side chain provides recognition features normally present in the tyrosyl amide bonds. At the present time a lack of three dimensional structural information of TPKs either free or bound with inhibitors necessitates reliance on structure-activity studies to probe the nature of these interactions.

Structurally, styryl-based inhibitors can be differentiated according to aryl (2, Figure 1) and vinyl substitution (X and Y, Figure 1). Two important nuclei which have emerged within this class of inhibitors are the formamido-containing compounds, such as erbstatin la,4and the CISince cyanocinnamamido-based analogs typified by lb. 8~12~14~15 it is known that TPK inhibitors can exhibit selectivity with respect to various families of TPKs,16.rsa limited study was undertaken to examine how these aryl and side chain moieties contribute to the TPK inhibitory profile of la and lb. Both compounds were accordingly dissected into their respective aryl and side chain portions and two new analogs lc and Id were prepared from the exchange of side chains between the two (Figure 2). Derivative lc incorporates the aryl ring of erbstatin la with the side chain of lb, while analog Id combines the 3,4_dihydroxyphenyl ring of lb with the formamido side chain of erbstatin (Figure 2). Synthesis of the formamido analogs was performed as previously described" (la mp 148 "C; lit.*O mp 149-151 "C and Id mp 196-198 "C; lit.*' mp 185-187 "C) and preparation of the a-cyanocinnamamido-based analogs was according to the method of Gazit et al." (lb mp 234 dec.; lit.`* 231°C and lc mp 188-190 "C; lit.* mp 200 "C).

The TPK inhibitory activity of these analogs was then compared using immunopercipitated EGFR and ~56'"' preparations as previously describedz3 (Figure 3). The data indicate a high degree of structural specificity between EGFR and p561Ck these analogs. In EGFR assays, compounds for lb and Id, bearing the 3,4_dihydroxyphenyl ring, were poor inhibitors ( IC, values > 1000 PM), while inhibitors la and lc, bearing the 2,5_dihydroxyphenyl ring, were better inhibitors. In the latter group the formamido side chain-containing la exhibited both a slightly better IC,, value (5 PM) (reported3 IC,, = 3 l_tM)and a greater level of maximal inhibition (90%) than analog lc, which bears the cr-cyanocinnamamido structure (IC,, = 10 PM with 60% maximal inhibition). The poor inhibitory properties of the 3,4_dihydroxyphenyl analogs lb and Id were not consistent with previously reported values against EGFR (lb IC,, = 4 l.tMr5; Id IC,, = 7 pM4). However, previous estimates of inhibition evaluated EGFR kinase activity following addition of EGF, while in the present case, inhibitory activity was measured using basal EGFR kinase activity. An interesting feature exhibited by these compounds is that maximal inhibition varies greatly (Figure 3). While this has previously been observed with (+/-)-phenazocine in the same EGFR assay system," the reasons for this behavior are not clear.

In the ~56'"~ assays compounds la and Id, bearing the formamido side chain were essentially inactive regardless of ring substitution, while the a-cyanocinnamamide-based analogs showed significant activity (lb IC,, = 7 l_tM;lc IC,, = 100 l.tM). A variation in maximal inhibition was also observed, similar to that seen in the EGFR system. This is the first example of a comparison of inhibitory potencies between EGFR and ~56'~~ for the styryl class of compounds. These findings are consistent with previous reports that certain inhibitors can exhibit marked differences in potency among select TPKs.s~ls~le While previous work has shown that TPK inhibitory potency increases as hydroxyls are added to the aryl ring,r5 the present study indicates that the hydroxyl substitution pattern is also of great importance. Results of this study show that the 2,Sdihydroxyphenyl ring confers specificity for EGFR relative to ~56'"~. Additionally, while the formamido side chain exhibited good activity in EGFR, it was inactive in ~56"~ regardless of ring substitution.This study, while limited in scope, supports previous findings that significant changes in both potency and specificity can be achieved by selective modification of either ring or side chain portions of this very important class of inhibitors. Further studies are in progress to more fully exploit this behavior in the development of inhibitors selective for specific TPKs.
