Tryptophan synthase, an allosteric molecular factory
Thomas RM Barends1, Michael F Dunn2 and Ilme Schlichting1
Tryptophan synthase (TrpS) is a pyridoxal phosphatecontaining bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the last two steps in the biosynthesis of L-tryptophan. Indole, an intermediate generated at the active site of the a-subunit is ° channeled via a 25 A long tunnel to the b-active site where it reacts with an aminoacrylate intermediate derived from L-serine. The two reactions are kept in phase by allosteric interactions between the two subunits. The recent development of novel a-site ligands and a-reaction transition state analogs combined with kinetic and crystal structure analysis of Salmonella typhimurium tryptophan synthase has provided new insights into the allosteric regulation of substrate channeling, the reaction mechanisms of the a and b active sites, and the influence of structural dynamics.

Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2008, 12:593­600 This review comes from a themed issue on Mechanisms Edited by James Naismith and Gideon Davies Available online 31st July 2008 1367-5931/$ ­ see front matter # 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. DOI 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.07.011

Imagine being a chemist having to perform a tricky synthesis using just one catalyst, involving a reaction between two intermediates that are difficult and costly to prepare and that can easily escape from the system or take part in unwanted side reactions. Ideally, one would prepare each molecule of the two intermediates precisely at the moment it is required, that is, producing one molecule of the one intermediate and keeping it sequestered until a molecule of the other intermediate has been prepared, and then bringing the two molecules together immediately so that side reactions and material losses are virtually excluded. Although such a system would seem impossible, bacterial tryptophan synthases have evolved to do just this. Tryptophan synthase (TrpS) is a bienzyme complex that catalyzes the last two steps in the biosynthesis of L-Trp.

TrpS has an a- and a b-active site in an ab heterodimer ° that is part of an a2b2 oligomer, connected by a 25 A long tunnel (Figure 1). The a-site cleaves 3-indole-D-glycerol 30 -phosphate (IGP) to give indole and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) (Figure 2). The tryptophan-generating b-reaction requires a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) cofactor and occurs in two stages (Figure 2): In Stage I, the external aldimine of L-Ser undergoes a b-elimination reaction to give the external aldimine of a-aminoacrylate, E(A-A); in Stage II, indole reacts with E(A-A) to give LTrp. In order to prevent escape of indole by diffusion through the cell membranes, indole is channeled from the a-site to the b-site via the tunnel (for reviews see [1,2,3]). In order to keep the two reactions in phase, the a-reaction and b-reaction regulate each other through reciprocal allosteric interactions. An important feature in TrpS allosteric regulation is the shuttling between open, low-activity, and closed, high-activity conformations of the active sites, with the equilibrium depending on the ligands bound to the a-active site and the covalent intermediates formed at the b-active site. For instance, production of the aminoacrylate at the b-site activates the a-site, ensuring timely production of indole [1,3,4­7]. TrpS is a model system for substrate channeling, allosteric communication, and PLP biochemistry. Thus, a wealth of structural, kinetic, and mechanistic data on TrpS has been gathered over decades, and a great deal is known about the overall mechanisms of the a-reaction and b-reaction (see e.g. [3,8,9]). Nevertheless, as summarized here, in the past couple of years, significant progress has been made in understanding the structural basis of allosteric regulation of TrpS, the mechanisms of the a-reaction and the b-reaction, and the roles played by conformational change in modulating the activities of the two catalytic sites. These advances have been made possible by new IGP analogs, a-reaction transition state analogs generated in situ, active site mutants, advanced kinetic studies, and crystal structures of reaction intermediates, in particular of the b-site quinonoid intermediate. Since a recent in-depth review had a strong emphasis on the kinetic aspects of these studies [3], the current review will mainly focus on recently developed insights into the structural determinants of TrpS catalysis and allosteric regulation.

Non-cleavable IGP mimics and transitionstate analogs
The a-site cleaves the C3­C30 bond of IGP to yield G3P and indole. Recently, several novel synthetic analogs of IGP have been introduced [10,11]. It has been shown that some of these a-site ligands (ASLs) promote the closed form of the a-subunit and are potent allosteric

Molecular graphics were prepared using PyMol [47]. Figure 2

Overview of reactions catalyzed by TrpS. The a-site splits indole glycerol phosphate (IGP) into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and indole. Indole diffuses through a tunnel to the b-site. The b-reaction is shown counterclockwise, starting with the covalent PLP-enzyme complex, the internal aldimine E(Ain) which is shown in the upper right corner. Reaction with serine results in the external aldimine of serine E(Aex). This is in equilibrium with its dehydration product, the external aldimine of aminoacrylate E(AA), the production of which concludes Stage I of the b-reaction. Indole emerging from the tunnel reacts with E(AA) in Stage II of the b-reaction, resulting in the quinonoid intermediates E(Q2) and E(Q3) and the external aldimine of tryptophan E(Aex2), from which tryptophan is cleaved, resulting in the internal aldimine and restoration of the b-site. For clarity, the geminal diamine intermediates occurring between internal aldimines and external aldimines and the quinonoid intermediate E(Q1) [39] occurring on the pathway between the external aldimine and the aminoacrylate are omitted.

The a-site (a) Reaction mechanism of the a-reaction. aGlu49 transfers a proton from C30 -OH to C3 using a push­pull mechanism, while aAsp60 stabilizes the developing positive charge on N1. (b) In the a-site, indoline reacts with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to form an indoline-G3P adduct that is a transition-state mimic. (c) Stereo figure showing a close-up of the a-sites of the indoline-G3P adduct/quinonoid complex (light gray, pdb code 3CEP [15]) and the IGP complex (dark gray, pdb code 2RH9). Loop aL2 is colored green, aL6 is colored magenta. Two conformations of the catalytic aGlu49 exist, an active one, oriented toward the indoline-G3P adduct and interacting with the atoms corresponding to C3 and the C30 -OH, and an inactive one, hydrogen bonded to aTyr173. aGlu49 resides in a hydrophobic pocket formed by aLeu127, aLeu100, aPhe22 and aIle232. Closure of the active site involves a hydrogen bond between aAsp60 on loop aL2 and aThr183 on loop aL6. The methyl group of the aThr183 side chain pushes the indole group of IGP toward the catalytic aGlu49 and helps the C3 atom attain a tetrahedral configuration that is required in the transition state.

effectors, affecting the E(Aex)/E(AA) equilibrium in the b-site and increasing the apparent L-Ser affinity of TrpS as do IGP and G3P [12]. Since these synthetic ASLs are non-cleavable, they can be used to probe allosteric interactions with the early intermediates in Stage I of the breaction. In this way it was shown that in the internal aldimine E(Ain) state the b-site switches from a lowaffinity to a high-affinity state in response to ASL binding [13]. In the transition state of the a-reaction, the IGP C3 atom is sp3-hybridized (Figure 3a). By allowing G3P to react in

the a-site with a nucleophilic indole analog like o-aminophenol or indoline, two a-reaction transition state analogs were prepared in situ, which each have an sp3hybridized atom at the C3-equivalent position [12,14,15] (Figure 3b). Crystal structures showed that like the binding of IGP, G3P, indole propanol phosphate (IPP) [1,6,16­19] and the novel non-cleavable ASLs [12,20], these transition state analogs induce the closed conformation of the a-site in which loop aL2 (a53 to a60) moves toward the active site and loop aL6 (a179 to a193) becomes ordered (Figure 3b), binding to aL2 via a crucial hydrogen bond between aThr183 on aL6 and aAsp60 on

aL2 [14,15]. This orients aAsp60 so that it can stabilize the charge developing on the indole N as the indole is cleaved off. The C30 ­OH proton is transferred to C3 by the catalytic aGlu49 in a push­pull mechanism, probably involving a neutral aGlu49 given the apolar surroundings of this residue [3,14,15] (Figure 3c). Crystal structures show two different conformations for aGlu49: an inactive one pointing away from the substrate [21], and an active one pointing toward the positions of the C30 ­OH and C3 moieties [14,15,17,22]. Switching between these conformations of aGlu49 is probably an important factor in turning the a-site on and off [14].

b-Site reaction specificity
Whereas the a-site produces indole from IGP, the b-site produces aminoacrylate from serine, using a PLP cofactor to activate it by binding it as an external aldimine. PLP can stabilize negative charges, making substrates bound to PLP liable to many kinds of reactions including b-elimination and decarboxylation [23,24]. The reaction specificity in a PLP enzyme can be understood using the Dunathan hypothesis (Figure 4a): Stereoelectronic considerations predict that of the three bonds to the a-carbon atom bound to PLP, the one that is perpendicular to the plane of the PLP p-system will be most easily cleaved [25­27]. In TrpS, the conserved loop bL3 (b109­b115) on the COMM domain forms a highly specific binding site for the carboxylate group of the substrate and various intermediates of the b-reaction. This places the bond to the Ha of the serine external aldimine perpendicular to the plane of the PLP p-system, setting up the system for removal of the a-proton and subsequent b-elimination. Mutations to loop bL3 have been studied to further the understanding of the reaction mechanism and specificity of TrpS [20,28,29]. The bThr110Val mutation, which replaces a hydrogen bonding partner to the substrate carboxylate with a methyl group severely decreased the ability to form the aminoacrylate external aldimine E(AA) and consequently severely impaired b-reaction and ab-reaction. This is probably due to a widening of the b-active site and a reorientation of the communication or COMM domain (see below) as demonstrated in the crystal structure. The bGln114Asn mutation, which shortens the bGln114 side chain connecting the bL3 loop with the rest of the protein, resulted in two fractions of enzyme; a yellow one with wild-type-like properties and ­ surprisingly ­ a red one inactivated by a side reaction typical for PLP enzymes [30]: Just like the substrate and product external aldimines, the aminoacrylate external aldimine can be cleaved off via a geminal diamine intermediate. In the E(AA) case this leads to the formation of an internal aldimine with bLys87 and highly reactive, free aminoacrylate (Figure 4b) as in for example tyrosine phenol-lyase [31]. Like in other PLP enzymes [30,32], the aminoacrylate external aldimine is not as easily cleaved as the substrate or product external
Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2008, 12:593­600

aldimines [20]. Nevertheless, unbound aminoacrylate may form and if not released to the solvent to give pyruvate and ammonia, can attack the internal aldimine with its acrylate C3 atom to form a C­C bond at C-40 of the PLP moiety resulting in the inactivation of the tightly bound cofactor and thus the enzyme [33,34]. This side reaction is enhanced in the bGln114Asn mutant because in the mutant the closed state of the b-site is stabilized, presumably keeping unbound aminoacrylate in the b-site long enough for inactivation to occur. Thus, in determining the reaction specificity at the b-site not only the orientation of the scissile bond (as in Dunathan's hypothesis) but also the rate of interconversion between the opened and closed states is crucial [20]. This phenomenon was hinted at by other mutants that exhibited altered reaction specificity, for example, bAsp305Ala [35].

Communication in TrpS: a switchboard in the COMM domain
The key structural element that coordinates the activities of the a-sites and b-sites is a single domain formed by residues b102­b189, which has been called the movable [16] or COMM domain [6]. The positioning of this domain defines the open state and closed state of the b-subunit: In the open state PLP is accessible to the solvent [21], whereas in the closed state, the COMM domain moves toward PLP and forms crucial interactions with the rest of the enzyme [12,15,20]. Within the COMM domain, helix bH6 (b165­b181) is emerging as the switchboard for allosteric communication within the enzyme [3]: Comparing structures of open and closed a-sites and b-sites shows that in the open conformation, bAsn171 on bH6 interacts with the catalytic aAsp60 on aL2, whereas in the closed conformation bH6 is displaced by one turn owing to the closure of aL6, placing bArg175 in contact with aAsp60 (and aPro57) and a hydrogen bond is formed between aGly181 on aL6 and bSer178 on bH6 (Figure 5). Mutations of bSer178 severely affect allostery [19,36,37]. Moreover, the network of interactions between bH6, aL2, and aL6 in the closed state probably assists in the closure of the a-site. Also, substitution of bLeu169 and bCys170 on bH6 occludes the tunnel leading to indole accumulation [38]. Thus, bH6 is at the center of allosteric communication, functioning as a hub for communication involving the a-active sites and the b-active site and possibly also the tunnel.

Reaction of indole with aminoacrylate: structure of a quinonoid intermediate
The next step in the enzymatic sequence is the reaction of the aminoacrylate external aldimine with indole. The formation of E(AA) leads to 30-fold activation of the a-site [5,28]. As soon as indole has been produced, it diffuses through the tunnel and reacts with the

b-site reaction specificity. (a) Application of Dunathan's hypothesis [25­27] to TrpS. Loop bL3 fixes the position of the substrate's carboxylate group, placing the Ca­Ha bond perpendicular to the PLP p-system. Upon removal of the a-proton, the bonding electrons can thus be easily accommodated in the PLP p-system, and this destabilizes the Ca­Ha bond. (b) Cleavage of the aminoacrylate external aldimine results in the formation of aminoacrylate and E(Ain). When released to the solvent, aminoacrylate is converted to pyruvate and ammonia, but when kept inside the b-site may react with E(Ain) with its C3 atom resulting in inactivation of the cofactor [20,33,34].

aminoacrylate to first form a quinonoid intermediate E(Q2), which is deprotonated to form quinonoid intermediate E(Q3) [39,40]. Quinonoid intermediates play a key role in the catalytic mechanism of PLP-dependent enzymes. Despite this importance, a high-quality structure of a PLP-quinonoid has been determined only recently. In TrpS, lifetime and occupancy of the fleeting quinonoid species can be increased significantly by

The 2.1 A resolution electron density map of this indoline quinonoid shows the expected flat configuration of the conjugated system (Figure 6b).

Conclusion
network between bArg141, bAsp305, bSer297, bSer299, bAsp138, and bLeu166 [6,12,16,35,43]. Given its position with respect to the indoline moiety, bGlu109 could, after a small side chain rotation, act to stabilize the charges developing on the indole N during the reaction with E(AA), as had been proposed before (see [12] and [44] and references therein). This shows that bGlu109 plays a dual role: It facilitates dehydration of E(Aex) to form the aminoacrylate [12,29,44] and stabilizes the charges developing upon the formation of the indole quinonoid. Moreover, bLeu166 moves into the active site to complete the indole-binding pocket, which it forms together with bPhe306 and bThr190. Also, the structure implicates bLys87 as an acid/base catalyst in the conversion of

The past few years have seen the accumulation of important new kinetic and structural data on catalysis and allosteric regulation in TrpS, thanks in no small part to the development of powerful new tools like non-cleavable ASLs that allow control over the state of the a-site and thus of the allosteric signals sent by it. Transition state analogs prepared in situ have shed light on the a-reaction mechanism and associated signaling, and the in situ preparation of a quinonoid species in the b-site has allowed a structural study of Stage II of the b-mechanism and its allostery. Also, mutations to the b-site have revealed a new layer of complexities associated with b-site reaction specificity, in particular its structural dynamics. As TrpS is a paradigm for two central themes in protein biochemistry, allosteric regulation and catalysis by PLP, the recent
