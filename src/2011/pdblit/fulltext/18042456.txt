The negative regulator)' genes. PHO,~O and PH085. involved in transcriptional regulation of the )'east repressible acidphosphatase-encoding gene. PH05. have been cloned. Expression of PH080 and PH085 has been studied by means of h~cZ fusions. We show here that these expressions are inorganic phosphate (P~) independent and that they are controlled b) the PH080 gene product; moreover, PHO,vO expression is controlled by PHO85. We also present genetic evidenc,: for an interaction between the PHO80 and PHOs5 proteins" increas~:d PH085 gene dosage partially compensates for the Nu;8o-1 mutation and this effect is allele-specific. The ph¢,,~o-1 allele !",as been cloned and sequenced. The mutation changes GIv -'-''~ to Asp. This region was shown to be essential for PHO80 fi,,nction by C-tc:minal deletion analysis.

INTRODUCTION

Expression of the PH05 gene encoding the so-called 'repressible acid phosphatase' in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is repressed by Pi. Regulation of this gene occurs at the transcriptional level (Kramer and Andersen, 1980; Rogers et al., 1982; Lemire et al., 1985) and involves a complex regulatory system consisting of, at least, five regulatory genes: PH02, PH04, PH080, PH081 and PH085. A genetic model assigning a function to each of these regulatory genes has been proposed by Oshima (1982). This 1982

model states that two activators, PHO2 and PHO4, are necessary for PH05 transcription. In repression conditions (high P~ concentration in the culture medium), a negative regulatory complex, formed by the PHO80 and PHO85 gene products, should interact with the PHO4 protein, preventing it from activating PH05 transcription. In derepression, conditions (low Pi concentration in the culture medium), the PHO81 protein is supposed to interact with the negative complex, releasing the positive factor PHO4; this factor is thus free to activate PH05 transcription in concert with the PHO2 factor. According to this regulatory model, all the PHO regulatory genes are expressed constitutively. We have previously shown that transcription of PH04 and PH02 is P, independent (Legrain et al.. 1986' Berben et ai.. 1988). However, studies on PH08I transcription have demonstrated that this latter one is controlled by the P, level through the action of the PHO regulatory genes (Yoshida et al.. 1989). Moreover. on the basis of Northern-blot analysis of PH080 transcript. Toh-e and Shimauchi (1986) have suggested that transcription of PH080 is strongly diminished in a ph,85
rnnll:~nt

182 We show here that PH080 expression is enhanced in pho85 or pho80 mutants and that PH085 expression is affected by the PH080 gene product. We also present evidence of a protein-protein interaction between PHO80 and PHO85. Moreover, our results lead to the localization of a region essential for PHO80 function. coding sequence. This latter region includes a fragment, extending 637-bp further in tae 5' direction of the 1.8-kh fragment, necessary for full expression of PH080. The nt sequence of this fragment was previously reported (Giili. quet et al., 1987b). The PH085 gene was isolated from a yeast DNA library, kindly provided by Dr. E. Dubois (Free University of Brussels) and prepared by inserting yeast DNA fragments, produced by partial digestion of total DNA from the strain 1278b with Sau3A, into the BamHl site of pFLI (described by Chevalier et al., 1980). E. coil strains bearing this library were screened, by colony hybridization, with a 19-nt synthetic oligo probe (5'-CACCCTCTACGGc CATCCG) homologous to the region between nt + 128 and + 146 in the PH085 coding sequence (Uesono et al., 1987). Restriction analysis of plasmid pU 1-1, isolated from a posi, tire clone, showed that it contains a 3.7-kb yeast genomic DNA insert. Comparison of the restriction map of this fragment with the one sequenced by Uesono et al. (1987) indicates that it contains the whole PH085 gene (Fig, IB).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

(a) Cloning of the PH080 and PH085 regulatory genes A recombinant plasmid containing the PH080 gene was recovered from a yeast gene library, constructed in YCp50 (Rose et al., 1988), by selecting fi~r its ability to complement a pho80-1 mutation in S. cerevisiae (Gilliquet et al., 1987a). Restriction analysis of this plasmid (pC2-1)indicated that it contains a 6.6-kb DNA insert. Integration of this fragment was performed and genetic analysis of the integrant strain proved that integration occurred at a site closely linked to the pho80 locus (data not shown). The restriction map of this fragment (Fig. 1A) shows that it contains the 1.8-kb fragment, carrying the PH080 coding region flanked 5' by l l6-bp, isolated and sequenced by Toh-e and Shimauchi (1986); it contains also an additional 5' non-

flGal activities were measured in the transformants ~rown under repression or derepression conditions (Table i). From the results shown in Table I, we can deduce that steady-state levels of PHO80 and PHO85 are not affected bY P~ and that the production of PHO85 is considerably higher than that of PHO80. Moreover, we show that the steady-state level of PHO80 is enhanced in pho80 and pho85 mutants; this indicates a negative control of PHO80 synthesis by itself and by PH085. In the same way, production of PHO85 is enhanced in a pho80 mutant: PH080 seems to repress PHO85 synthesis. Production of PHO85 is also slightly decreased in a pho85 mutant; however, this latter result is due to diminished copy number of the plasmid bearing a PH085: :lacZ fusion. TABLE I

· pC2-70 is a muiticopy vector bearing the PH080: :hwZ fused gone. It was constructed by in frame fusion of a !. l-kb Sstl-Clal fragment carrying the ' 750-bp 5'.non-cod!ng region and the first 305 bp of the PH080 coding region to the lacZ gone in YEp357 (Myers et ai., 1986). pUI-4 is a multicopy vector bearing the PHO85::iacZ fused gone. it was constructed by in-frame fusion of a 1.9-kb Hindlil-BamHl fragment carrying the 5'-noncoding region and the first 25 bp of the PH085 coding region to the lacZ gone in YEp357. YEp356MpPH05 :: lacZ is a multicopy vector bearing the PH05 :: lacZ fused gone. it was constructed by inserting, in YEp356M, a 600-bo BamHI.Sall fragment isolated from pJD7 (Dumont et al., 1989) and carrying the PH05 promoter with the start codon, YEp356M is derived from YEp356R (Myers et al., 1986) where the Asp718 site has been rendered blunt by filling-in the ends with Pollk. Strain VG51, bearing the deleted phoSO allele, was constructed as follows: a 557-bp Xba [ fragment was removed from plasmid pC2-2, a lobe-copynumber plasmid (YCp50) bearing a 4.2-kb Bam HI yeast genomic fragment containing the PH080 gene (see restriction map Fig. I A), and replaced by a Xhol.Sall fragment, bearing the LEL~ gene. The Barn HI fragment, consisting of LEL~ with PH080 flanking sequences, was used to transfi~rm .~east strain YH40 (MA T~, ura3-167, leu2, trpi. his3 ) to Lcu protou ophy. Deletion of the PH080 gene in strain VG51 was verified by genetic anal.~sis. Strain VGI0I, bearing the deleted pho85 allele was coustructed as follows: a 515-bp Sstl.Asp718 fragment was removed from plasmid pU I-I (see .~ectiona) and replaced by a Xhol-Sall fragment bearing the LE~.2 gone to obtain plasmid pUI-3. The Bgll-BamHl fragment, consisting of LEU2 ,~ith PHO,~¢5 flankingregions, was isolated from pUI-3 and used to transform yeast YH40 to leucine prototrophy. Genetic analysis has verified deletion of the PHO,'~5 gone in strain VGI01. High P~ and low P~ medium were as described in Legrain et al. (1986). d ~Gal activity was measured, according to Miller ( 1~J72),on cell extracts prepared by breakage in a French press. The yeast cells were grown to a density of 1.5 x 107 cells/ml at 29°C. One unit ofenzyme a:ctivity is defined as the amount of enzyme liberating 1 #tool of o.nitrophenol/h mg of protein. The protein concentration of the extracts was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (1951).

184 Strains VG49a(pho80-1), VGP2.2A(phoS0-2) and VG51 carrying a wt genomic PH085 allele were transformed with a high-copy plasmid bearing the PH085 gene ( p U l - l ) . The effect of overexpression of PH085 on the repression of APase activity was examined (Table II). The results shown in Table II demonstrated clearly that, with increasing numbers of PH085 copies, partial repressior ofPH05 occu:s in a pho80-1 mutant and that this effect is specific to this mutation. Moreover, we have shown that thi~, ~ffect is due to the PH085 gene: a high-copy plasmid carrying the PH085 gene disrupted by LEU2 (plasmid pU1-3; Table I, footnote b) can not complement a phoSO-I mutation (data not shown). These results can account for a protein-protein interaction between P H O 8 0 and PHO85. Similar results of dosage suppression have been obtained with CKSI in cdc28 ts mutants (Hadwiger et al., 1989) and with SNF1 in snf4 amber and deletion mutants (Celenza and Carlson, 1989). Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation of the C K S I and CDC28 proteins (Hadwiger et al., 1989) and of S N F I and SNF4-/~Gal fusion proteins (Celenza et al., 1989) has been realized and proven to be a physical association of these proteins. We have also examined the effect of an increased PH080 copy number on PH05 repression in a pho85 null mutant. Strain VG 10I (pho85-Al :: LEU2) was transformed with a high-copy plasmid carrying the PH080 gene. The APase activity of a transformant and of a control pho85 null s t r ~ transformed with YCp50 was determined by the colony staining method (Toh-e et al., 1973). In this case, overex.

(2) Sequence of the wt PH080 gelne published by Madden et ai. (1988). (3) Sequence of the wt PH080 allele from which the phoSO.l mutation has been obtained (accession number with GenBank M35088-YAYi02). This allele has been cloned as follows: DNA from strain YATi02 (MATa, pho3, pho81, argl, trpl) was isolated and digested with Sstl. The fraction containing the ¥H080 gene was localized, after gel electrophoresis, by Southern analysis. This fraction was purified and subsequently cloned into the Sstl site of pBlucscript plasmid (Stratagene). The resultingvector has been used to transform E. coll. By hybridization with a PH080 probe, we have found one clone, containing the PH080 gene. The upper lines (s) are the nt sequences and the lower hnes (b) the deduced aa sequences. The site of the phoSO-i mutation is boxed.

from the plasmid pC2-13 bearing the P H 0 8 0 gone by one additionai Sstl site located in the 3' non-coding region at about 450 bp downstream from the stop codon (Fig. 2B). Localization of the. fragment bearing the pho80-1 mutation was done by replacing fragments containing the pho80-1 mutated gone by their homologous wt fragments (Fig. 2C). As can be deduced from the analysis depicted in Fig. 2C, the pho80-1 mutation maps downstream from the Xbal fragment. A segment of 250 bp downstream from this Xbal site has been sequenced by the dideoxy sequencing method on double-stranded D N A (Chen and Seeburg, 1985). Comparison of this sequence with those published by Toh-e and Sbimauchi (1986) and by Madden et ai. (1988) reveals several differences (Fig. 3A). These differences, but also discrepancies in the restriction maps suggest a great genetic variabiiity between the P H 0 8 0 genes isolated from different strains. We therefore cloned the wt allele identical to the one t'rc~m which the pho80-l allele has been obtained (see Fig. 3 legend) and sequenced its 3' end. Comparison of this sequence with that of the pho80-1 mutant shows that the mutant phenotype is due to a G ~ A

transition, causing a substitution of a Gly for an Asp at 229 in the P H O 8 0 protein.

(e) Analysis of the C terminus of PHO80
P H O 8 0 is a 293-aa protein. Comparison of its sequenh with those contained in the N B R F - P I R d a ta bank (rele~ 18.0), using the Lipman and Pearson (1986) algorith~ reveals no obvious homologies. The main characteristic this protein is the presence, at its C terminus of a 39-aa region rich in Ser and Thr and in basic aa. To assess the role of the C-terminal region on P H O 8 0 function, C.te~i, nal deletions were constructed and their phenotypic effects were examined. Ability of the various constructions to repress P H 0 5 e::pression in a pho80-1 mutant has I ~ tested (Fig. 4). To exclude any intera|lelic complementatio~ effects with the pho80-1 copy through multimeric prot~ structure, these constructions were also tested in the phoSO -deleted strain VG51. The results obtained are similar to those obtained with the pho80-1 mutant. As depicted in Fig. 4, the P H O 8 0 protein might be shot. toned by up to 48 aa at its C terminus without greatly

Plasmid pC2-45 was constructed as follows: a 0.2.b fragment containing translational stop codons and the CYCI terminator was introduced in the Pvull site of the PH080 coding region. The 1.9-kbHadli fragment containing the disrupted PH080 gene has been introduced in the Pvull site of pFL 1. pC2- ! 3d2, pC2-13d3 and pC2-13d7 have been obtaind by 3' terminal deletions realized as follows: plasmid pC2-13 was linearized with Asp718 and digested with BAL31 nuclease (0.4 units//~g DNA, 30°C, 2 mint to remove 750-950 bp. After treatment with ['4 DNA polymerase, the resulting vector was ligated with a 2.0-kb 12 fragment containingt~ streptomycin-resistant gone flanked by inverted repeats carrying translational stop codons (Prentki and Krisch, 1984).The resulting vectors were selectd in E. coilstrain C600 pyrF(rk, mk, pro, are. pyrF ) tbr streptomycin resistance. Sequence analysis to determine the exact endpoint of each deletion we~ realized on double-stranded DNA after cloning of the fragments bearing the PHO80-deleted gone in the pUCI8 vector (Yanisch-Perron et al., 1985[ pC2-24 has been constructed by inserting a 6-bp oligo (5'-GGGCCC; TAB linker, Pharmacia) in the Pvull site of the PH080 gone borne by the YCp~. vector. The construction has been verified by sequencing. (b) pho80.1 strain (VG49a) is described in Table II, footnote b. pho80-deleted strain (VGSI) is described in Table I, footnote b. (¢) APase activity of intact yeast cell suspension was measured as described in Table II, footnote c. The bars indicati which part of the PHO80 protein is present. The mutants that retain PHO80 function are indicated by shaded bars, the one that partially retains a pH080 function, by a hatched bar, and those that are not functional by open bars. The exact endpoints of each deletion are indicated by the numbers in the ?HOB0 sequence' column, and the added numbers in this column indicate the number of additional aa before a translational stop. Thus ,+5' f0t PHOg0-P-- Ser-Thr-Val-lle-Asp; '+6' for PHOS0-d2 = Gly-Asp-Pro-Val-Ile-Asp; '+5' for PHOS0.d7= Atg.Cdy-Ser-Cdy-Asp: "+4' for PHO80-d3~ Ser-Gly-Ile-Arg 6P represent the insertion of Giy and Pro between a~ 226 and 227 in the PHOS0 protein.

affecting function, its

but when PHO80 is shortened by ,~other 7 aa, its function in repression of PH05 expression is affected (Fig. 4, PHO80-d2, PHO80-d7, PHO80-d3). lvloreover, the PHOSO protein shortened by 67 aa is not functional(Fig. 4, PHOSO-P). Our results clearly show that the 48-aa terminus containing the 39-aa region rich in Ser and Thr and in basic aa has no function in repression of 71t05 expression. We have shown that the pho80-1 mutation corresponds to a substitution at aa 229 (section d) and that the PHO80-P containing the N-terminal 226 aa has lost PHO80 activity. To study the importance of this region, we have analysed the effect of an insertion of 2 aa (Gly and Pro) between aa 226 and 227. This insertion abolished PHO80 activity (Fig. 4, PHO80-M). This loss of activity could be due to a nwdification in the secondary structure of the protein. Indeed, predictions of the secondary structure of the C-terminallymodified and of the wt protein were done by using the Gamier (1978) procedure and showed the emergence, in the modified protein, of a//-turn within a/~-sheet. Our results show that the region upstream from aa 245 is necessary for PHO80 function and that the mutated aa coded by pho80-1 is located in this region, at aa 229. It is noteworthy that this region contains a consensus site for protein kinase C phosphorylation (aa 238-240, Ser-ArgLys). Function of PHO80 could be regulated by phosphorylation: the PHO80 protein is likely to be a protein kinase (Toh-e et al., 1988) and we have shown that PHO80 and PIle85 could interact. It should also be noted that a modification of the potential phosphorylation site in PHO80 partially affects its function: in the mutated PHO80-d2 protein, the potential phosphorylation site Ser.Arg-Lys becomes Ser-Gly-Asp.

qf) Conclusions (l)The PH080 and PH085 genes have been cloned. (2) We show that expression of PH080: :iacZ and PH085::iacZ fusion genes is independent of Pi. Our results indicate that expression of PH085 is repressed by PH080; moreover, they indicate that expression of PH080 is repressed by itself and by PH085. This last result is contrary
to the results of Toh-e and Shi~aauchi (1986) which have s~ggested that PH085 is necessary for PH080 transcription. (3)Analysis of PH085 overexpression in phoSO mutants shows that PH085 can partially complement a pho80.1 mutation and that this effect is allele-specific. This result can account for a protein-protein interaction between PHO80 and PHO85. (4)A region necessary for PHO80 function was localized, by C-terminal deletion analysis, upstream from aa 245. Moreover, the mutated aa coded by pho80-1 is located in this region, at aa 229.
