Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have been shown to be a key component of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The use of NNRTIs has become part of standard combination antiviral therapies producing clinical outcomes with efficacy comparable to other antiviral regimens. There is, however, a critical issue with the emergence of clinical resistance, and a need has arisen for novel NNRTIs with a broad spectrum of activity against key HIV-1 RT mutations. Using a combination of traditional medicinal chemistry/SAR analyses, crystallography, and molecular modeling, we have designed and synthesized a series of novel, highly potent NNRTIs that possess broad spectrum antiviral activity and good pharmacokinetic profiles. Further refinement of key compounds in this series to optimize physical properties and pharmacokinetics has resulted in the identification of 8e (MK-4965), which has high levels of potency against wild-type and key mutant viruses, excellent oral bioavailability and overall pharmacokinetics, and a clean ancillary profile.
Introduction Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIsa) are a key component of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). NNRTIs target an allosteric binding pocket on the reverse transcriptase enzyme, and their binding is noncompetitive with respect to dNTPs and template/primer.1 There are currently three commercially available first generation NNRTIs: efavirenz, nevirapine, and delavirdine (Figure 1).2 Despite the demonstrated clinical efficacy of these compounds, the emergence of clinical resistance has become a key issue and a major cause of treatment failure. Recently, the second generation NNRTI etravirine (TMC-125, Figure 1) has been approved by the FDA and has demonstrated activity toward a number of clinically observed mutations.3 However, the need remains for alternative second generation NNRTIs that have a broad spectrum of activity versus mutant viruses and a high genetic barrier to the selection of new resistant strains. Since compliance is also a key issue in anti-HIV therapy, the need also exists for compounds that are safe, are easy to dose orally once a day, and have low potential for drug-drug interactions. Our efforts have focused on the design and synthesis of novel NNRTIs with potent and broad spectrum mutant activity that are also safe and have pharmacokinetics suitable for once a day oral dosing.

bioavailability that precluded its further development. Further efforts in this series have focused on preparing more soluble versions of 1 that we hypothesized would have better overall physical properties and improved pharmacokinetic profiles after oral dosing. Crystallographic studies with 14 showed that the lower edge of the indazole C ring lies under the P236 residue along the enzyme/solvent interface (Figure 3), and as such, we hypothesized that this region should be amenable to functionalization with polar, solubilizing substituents. We proposed to prepare a number of analogues of 1 in which the phenyl ring of the indazole moiety was replaced with a pyridine ring, with the goal of finding a close derivative that showed enhanced solubility and oral bioavailability while retaining the desirable overall biological profile seen with 1. In this manuscript, we describe the design, synthesis, and biological profile of this series of pyridine analogues that has led to the discovery of novel NNRTIs suitable for clinical development. Chemistry Target compounds were prepared by the generic method shown in Scheme 1. SNAr reaction of phenol 2 and aryl fluoride 3 provided the protected diaryl ether intermediate 4 in good yield. Removal of the methyl protecting group with boron tribromide progressed in excellent yield to give the key phenol intermediate 5. The target compounds were then prepared in a two-step sequence via alkylation of the phenol 5 with the 1-Boc3-bromomethylpyrazolopyridines 6a-d, followed by removal of the Boc protecting group with TFA to give the target compounds 8a-d. The critical bromo intermediates 6a5 and 6d5 were prepared via literature methods; however, bromides 6b and 6c were not known in the literature and were prepared by modification of related literature methodologies6,7 as detailed in Scheme 2. Ortho directed metalation of 4-chloropyridine 9 and reaction with the Weinreb amide provided the ketone intermediate 10. Heating 10 with hydrazine in the presence ot titanium isopropoxide effected ring closure to the 3-methylpyrazolopyridine 11. Compound 11 was protected selectively in the 1-position using standard conditions, and the protected intermediate 12 was brominated with NBS to provide the desired bromide 6b in moderate yield. Bromide 6c was synthesized in a similar manner, starting from 3-amino-4-methylpyridine 13. Protection of the amino group using sodium hexamethyldisilazane and Boc anhydride gave the protected intermediate 14 in

good yield. The methyl group in the 4-position was homologated to an ethyl group via directed metalation and treatment with iodomethane to give 15. Removal of the Boc protecting group with TFA and subsequent diazotization/cyclization of the amino intermediate 16 yielded the 3-methylpyrazolopyridine derivative 17. Compound 17 was converted to the desired bromide 6c via a two-step protection/bromination as described above. The 6-amino-7-aza derivative 8e was synthesized using a strategy similar to that detailed above (Scheme 3). Ortho directed metalation of 2,6-difluoropyridine (19) and subsequent quenching with the requisite Weinreb amide gave the ketone 20 in modest yield. Numerous attempts to modify the conditions of this metalation failed to provide increased yields. The intermediate ketone 20 was treated with hydrazine in the presence of titanium isopropoxide to give the hydrazone intermediate, and the hydrazone was refluxed in ethanol to effect efficient cyclization to the 3-methyl-6-fluoropyrazolopyridine intermediate 21. In a manner similar to that described previously for the des-fluoro analogues, 21 was Boc protected and brominated to give the bromide intermediate 23. In a procedure similar to that described above (Scheme 1), alkylation of the phenol 5 with bromide 23 provided 24 in good yield. Displacement of the fluorine of 24 with PMB amine also removed the N1-Boc protecting group to provide the protected intermediate 25. Heating 25 in neat TFA provided the desired target compound 8e in good yield. Results and Discussion Table 1 details the in vitro biological data for efavirenz, 1, and 8a-e. Compounds were evaluated for intrinsic enzyme inhibitory potency versus WT RT (wild type HIV-1 reverse transcriptase), as well as the K103N and Y181C mutant RTs.8 Compounds were also evaluated for antiviral potency (CIC95) against WT and the key mutant viruses in the presence of 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum; WT and mutants) as well as 50% NHS (normal human serum; WT) to evaluate the effects of protein binding.9 In general, inhibitory activity and antiviral activity improved as the nitrogen was moved around the aromatic ring from the 4-position (8a) to the 7-position (8d) in accord with our earlier hypothesis. The 7-aza analogue 8d exhibited highly potent enzyme inhibitory activity versus WT and the key mutants and also showed excellent antiviral potency against the same panel. Pharmacokinetic studies with 8d (Table 2) showed that the compound possessed promising pharmacokinetics after both iv and po dosing in several species, and as such, 8d became a compound of high interest in our program. Crystallographic studies with 8d10 (Figure 4) demonstrate that the compound binds to the K103N mutant-NNRTI binding pocket in a manner analogous to that reported previously for 1 in the WT binding site. All of the key interactions of the western A ring and central B ring with the Y181C-Y188C-W229 lipophilic binding pocket are maintained as seen previously with the structure of 1 bound to the WT enzyme. The Y181 side chain is rotated by 90° as seen in previous crystal structures that we have reported in this series.4 The two nitrogens of the pyrazolo moiety maintain two key hydrogen bonding interactions with the backbone carbonyl oxygen and NH of the K103 residue, and it is likely that this key interaction is critical for the high levels of potency observed versus the K103N mutant. The pyrazolopyridine heterocycle makes a stacking interaction with Y318 and also appears to make lipophilic interactions with the side chains of F227, P236, and V106. The bottom edge of this pyridyl ring lies along the enzyme-solvent interface as anticipated, and the nitrogen atom appears to be solvent exposed.

Further evaluation of 8d versus a wider panel of clinically relevant mutant viruses11 (Table 3) showed that the compound possessed broad activity versus most of the mutants tested. Only the Y188L mutation provided notable decreases in potency; this is presumably due to the direct interaction between the phenyl ring of 8d and the aryl ring of the Y188 residue. When the residue is mutated to a leucine, much of the interaction between the phenyl ring and the side chain is lost because of the decreased size of the side chain as well as the loss of the -stacking interaction. Y188L is a rare mutation, occurring in only 0.6% of clinical isolates.12 The Y188L mutation requires a two-base change in its codon, indicating that progression to this mutation occurs in a stepwise manner via several intermediate mutations.12 While the Y188L virus itself exhibits good fitness, the intermediate mutation Y188H is a much less fit virus, and the Y188F intermediate mutation appears to be slow growing.12 In-house cell culture selection experiments with later members of this class have failed to select for the Y188L mutation under a variety of conditions (details of the data for the final development candidate will be presented later in this

manuscript). While these studies suggest that the Y188L mutation may not be a serious issue for this series of compounds, it is also possible that secondary mutations could confer added fitness to one of the Y188L intermediates given the preexisting pool of viral mutations in a treatment experienced population. Therefore, only actual clinical experience with a compound of this class will provide a suitable answer to this question. On the basis of its excellent overall profile, 8d became a development candidate and was designated as MK-1107.8 Full ancillary evaluation of 8d showed the compound to be devoid of significant off-target activities, and the compound was also negative in preliminary genotoxicity determinations. Unfortunately, as 8d was being studied in depth to support its further development, difficulty was encountered producing a formulation that could provide the high exposures necessary to support po dosing in these safety studies. Further in vivo studies showed that the compound was orally bioavailable only when dosed as a solution, and this became an issue given the low solubility of the compound especially as higher doses/exposures were needed. While 8d did have improved solubility versus 1 (solubility of

8d at pH 7 is 0.1 µg/mL, while the solubility of 1 is so low that it cannot be determined), it appeared that further enhancements in solubility would be necessary to provide a compound whose exposure was not limited by solubility. As a result, development of the compound was halted, and we were forced to reevaluate our efforts in an attempt to further enhance the solubility and physical properties of this series. Once again, we sought to make minor changes to the structure of 8d in an effort to retain the aforementioned excellent biological profile of the compound. Using 8d as a starting point, we hypothesized that by adding an amino group in the 6-position of the pyridine ring, we could further enhance the basicity and possibly increase the solubility (especially at acidic pH) of this series of compounds while also maintaining the excellent overall profile of previous compounds in this series. A pyridyl nitrogen was reasonably well tolerated at the 6-position in a previous analogue in this series (Table 1, 8c), suggesting that the introduction of an amino group at this position might also be well tolerated. Molecular modeling

studies13 suggested that this compound would be accommodated by the active site in a similar manner to 1 and 8d, with the 6-amino group lying in the solvent exposed region and not making any detrimental interactions with the enzyme. Compound 8e was synthesized (Scheme 3) and was shown to possess enzyme inhibitory activity and antiviral activity similar to that observed with 8d (Table 1). 8e was shown to be several orders of magnitude more soluble than 8d especially at acidic pH (solubility of 8d is <0.1 µg/mL at pH 2; solubility of 8e is 10 µg/mL at pH 2), and these data encouraged further evaluation of the compound. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of 8e (Table 2) demonstrated that this compound possessed a similar profile to 8d in several species. More importantly, additional in vivo studies with 8e showed that the compound was fully orally bioavailable in a dose proportional manner when dosed as either a suspension or a solution. Evaluation of 8e (Table 3) against a wider panel of clinically relevant mutations confirmed that the compound retained excellent antiviral activity versus most

of the mutants that were evaluated. Once again, only the Y188L mutant showed notable decreases in antiviral potency, as observed with previous compounds in this series. Cell culture selection experiments with this compound have shown that the Y188L mutation does not appear to arise after treatment with the inhibitor. Under low MOI (multiple of infection) conditions ((1-5) × CIC95), small amounts of Y181C, P236L, and V106A are observed. Under higher MOI conditions at a 200 nM concentration, the V106A mutation is selected after 36 days. Under the highest MOI conditions (1000 nM), no mutations are observed after multiple months of treatment. Crystallographic studies14 with 8e were performed in the WT and Y181C mutant enzymes. Figure 5 shows the crystal structure of 8e bound in the WT active site. The WT crystal structure is essentially identical to the previous structures we have reported in this series, with all previously noted interactions with the active site maintained. Figure 6 shows the crystal structure of 8e in the Y181C mutant binding site. The binding mode in the Y181C mutant is strikingly similar to that seen in the WT enzyme. The binding of the compound is completely uninfluenced by the mutation of the 181 residue, as the inhibitor does not make any direct interaction with this residue. In total, all crystal structures that we have reported for this series demonstrate remarkably similar binding modes for the inhibitors in the WT and mutant active sites, with only very subtle differences in the central aryl ether conformation and slight movements of the compounds' relative positions in the site noted. It has been proposed in the

literature that the ability of NNRTIs to be somewhat conformationally flexible is of critical importance for their broader spectrum antiviral activity.15 Our results are consistent with this hypothesis; however, the differences in binding modes between the wild-type and mutant enzymes are more subtle. It is likely that the ability of compounds such as 8e to make direct interactions with the backbone of residue 103 and the ability to avoid direct interaction with Y181 are critical factors in determining the mutant profile of the compounds. Further preclinical evaluation of 8e showed the compound to be free of major ancillary activities, including no effects on QTc, heart rate, or blood pressure in a conscious cardiovascular dog model up to 55 µM plasma levels.16 8e demonstrates balanced metabolism in human microsomes via two pathways: oxidation by CYP3A4 on the methylene linker between the central ring and the pyrazolopyridine ring and glucuronidation at N1 of the pyrazolopyridine.16 In accord with its improved solubility, the compound did not exhibit any difficulties with formulation and had sufficient exposures in safety assessment studies. On the basis of available comparative in-house data, we believe that the overall pharmacokinetic profile of 8e

As such, the compound was moved forward as a clinical development candidate, labeled as MK-4965.8 8e was shown to have a low potential for drug-drug interactions in preclinical assessments and was clean in genotoxicity assessments, and no major issues were observed in safety assessment studies.16 On the basis of the results of these studies, 8e was advanced into phase I clinical trials. Further details of the early clinical studies with 8e, as well as the pharmacokinetics, formulation, process development, and more extensive SAR studies in this series, will be presented in subsequent publications from our laboratories.

(13) Compound 8e was placed in the NNRTI binding pocket based on prior knowledge of related compounds in NNRTI crystal structures. Approximately 30 conformations of each compound was generated using two algorithms: a distance geometry (ref (a)) and a knowledge based (ref (b)) method. All conformations were then subjected to energy minimization using the distance dependent dielectric constant of 2 and applying the MMFFs force field (ref (c)). All figures were created in PyMol (ref (d)). Modeling discussion references: (a) Crippen, C. M.; Havel, T. F.
