The structure of human telomeric DNA is controversial; it depends upon the sequence contexts and the methodologies used to determine it. The solution structure in the presence of K+ is particularly interesting, but the structure is yet to be elucidated, due to possible conformational heterogeneity. Here, a unique strategy is applied to stabilize one such structure in a K+ solution by substituting guanosines with 8-bromoguanosines at proper positions. The resulting spectra are cleaner and led to determination of the structure at a high atomic resolution. This demonstrates that the application of 8-bromoguanosine is a powerful tool to overcome the difficulty of nucleic acid structure determination arising from conformational heterogeneity. The obtained structure is a mixed-parallel / antiparallel quadruplex. The structure of telomeric DNA was recently reported in another study, in which stabilization was brought about by mutation and resultant additional interactions [Luu KN, Phan AT, Kuryavyi V, Lacroix L & Patel DJ (2006) Structure of the human telomere in K+ solution: an intramolecular (3+1) G-quadruplex scaffold. J Am Chem Soc 128, 9963­9970]. The structure of the guanine tracts was similar between the two. However, a difference was seen for loops connecting guanine tracts, which may play a role in the higher order arrangement of telomeres. Our structure can be utilized to design a small molecule which stabilizes the quadruplex. This type of molecule is supposed to inhibit a telomerase and thus is expected to be a candidate anticancer drug.

Highly repetitive sequences called telomeres exist at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomeres serve to protect against nonhomologous end-joining and nuclease attack [1­3]. The telomeres of somatic cells become shorter on replication, whereas those of germ cells and cancer cells maintain their lengths through elongation by telomerase, which is active in these cells [4]. Human telomeric DNA is 5­8 kb long and composed of repeats of the d(TTAGGG) sequence, with a 3¢ single-stranded overhang of  200 nucleotides [5,6]. DNA rich in guanosine residues tends to form a quadruplex with guanine-tetrad planes as core structures

[7]. Telomere DNA is rich in guanosine residues and thus its quadruplex structure is supposed to play certain roles in the regulation of telomere length. In particular, the finding that telomerase activity is inhibited by formation of the quadruplex [8­10] has attracted attention in terms of the development of novel anticancer drugs [11­17]. The solution structure of telomeric DNA in the presence of Na+ was determined using NMR for d[AGGG(TTAGGG)3] and was found to be an antiparallel basket-type quadruplex (Fig. 1A) [18]. Later, the crystal structure of telomeric DNA in the presence

of K+ was determined for the same sequence, and a quite different structure of a parallel propeller-type quadruplex (Fig. 1B) was found [19]. It should be noted that this structure is similar to the solution structure found for GGA-triplet repeat DNA in the presence of K+ [20­22]. Currently, the solution structure of human telomeric DNA in the presence of K+ is a hot topic, as this structure is believed to be biologically most relevant when a high intracellular K+ concentration is concerned. However, structure determination has not been feasible because of conformational heterogeneity. Recently, we suggested that in a K+ solution d[AGGG(TTAGGG)3] exists as a mixture of a mixedparallel / antiparallel quadruplex (Fig. 1C) and another structure, the former being the major form. This was based on CD and NMR examination of the structure and the thermal stability of a series of systematic derivatives of telomeric DNA in which guanosines were substituted with 8-bromoguanosines, which favor the syn conformation. This allowed determination of the syn / anti conformations of each guanosine in the naturally occurring structure, which led to the suggestion of
3546

a fold [23,24]. Here, we determined the structure of the mixed-parallel / antiparallel quadruplex at high resolution by means of proper substitutions that stabilize the naturally occurring major structure, and details of the structure are given. Our success demonstrates that 8-bromoguanosine is a powerful tool to overcome the difficulty of the structure determination arising from conformational heterogeneity. It is likely that this method with 8-bromoguanosine can be applied for structure determination in other difficult systems. The mixed-parallel / antiparallel fold has also been proposed for a variant of human telomeric DNA, d[AAAGGG(TTAGGG)3AA], in which the residues flanking the guanine tracts were mutated [25]. Very recently, the mixed-parallel / antiparallel structure, also called the (3+1) structure, was reported for another variant DNA with similar mutations, d[TTGGG(TTA GGG)3A] [26]. The (3+1) fold was adapted in a mixture with other structures for some DNAs with natural overhangs at their 5¢- and 3¢-ends [26,27]. Consistency regarding the mixed-parallel / antiparallel fold has been seen between our structure and that reported by Luu et al. [26], which were stabilized using different strategies. However, a difference between the two structures was seen for loops and sugar puckering. Mutation and resultant additional interactions in the Luu et al. case may be responsible for these differences. It is possible to design a small molecule which binds to and stabilizes the quadruplex of human telomeric DNA based on our determined structure, without introducing the mutation, in a K+ solution. This type of molecule is supposed to inhibit a telomerase and is thus expected to be a candidate anticancer drug.

Results
Two different strategies for exploring the quadruplex structure of human telomeric DNA in a K+ solution Two dimeric quadruplex structures of human telomeric DNA in a K+ solution have been reported for d(TAGGGTTAGGGT) and d(GGGTTAGGGTTA GGGT), respectively [28,29]. However, a naturally occurring unimolecular quadruplex structure in a K+ solution was not reported until recently. The difficulty with the structural determination is because the corresponding NMR spectrum is poor due to conformational heterogeneity. Recently, we succeeded in determining the fold of the unimolecular quadruplex structure in a K+ solution for d[AGGG(TTAGGG)3] [23,24]. This sequence is exactly the same as that for antiparallel and parallel quadruplexes reported under

Telomeric DNA structure in a K+ solution

Na+ solution and K+ crystal conditions, respectively. We overcame any difficulties by using the unique method of proper substitutions of guanosines with 8-bromoguanosines. It is known that 8-bromodeoxyguanosine takes on the syn conformation [30]. This was used to determine the syn / anti conformations of the quadruplex structure of d(TTTGG)4 [30]. It was shown that substitution of a guanosine in the syn conformation with an 8-bromoguanosine increased the thermal stability of the quadruplex, allowing determination of the syn / anti conformations [30]. This method has been used to explore the structure of human telomeric DNA in a K+ solution [23,24]. We tried to stabilize, or `freeze', the major structure of human telomeric DNA using the proper substitutions with 8-bromoguanosines. We synthesized many derivatives of human telomeric DNA having a series of systematic substitutions with 8-bromoguanosines. The positions to incorporate 8-bromoguanosines were searched for and optimized on the basis of the following guides: when a `proper' guanosine, which takes on the syn conformation in the native structure, is substituted with an 8-bromoguanosine, the CD spectrum should not change much, if at all, and the thermal stability should increase. Thus, we obtained ODN10 (Fig. 2A), in which incorporation of the substitutions with 8-bromoguanosines was optimized to stabilize, or freeze, the naturally occurring major structure [23,24]. The validity of the procedure was confirmed by the CD spectra of ODN1 and ODN10, which are very similar (Fig. 2I) and the thermal stability of ODN 10 (melting temperature: > 100 °C), which is much higher than that of ODN1 (melting temperature: 68 °C) (Fig. 2J). In this way, the position of the syn conformation for the major quadruplex structure was identified. The fold of the quadruplex structure had been determined previously [23,24], as shown in Fig. 1C. Ambrus et al. and Luu et al. used a different strategy to overcome the difficulty in exploring the structure of human telomeric DNA [25,26]. They mutated the residues flanking the four guanine tracts. The mutations stabilized the structure, probably by introducing additional interactions. Actually, the formation of an additional base pair involving a mutated residue was found [26]. It is hard to completely exclude the possibility that the mutations may have caused the change in the native structure. With our strategy, the sequence is not mutated. Proper substitutions with 8-bromoguanosines stabilize, or freeze, the naturally occurring major structure just by stabilizing the naturally occurring syn conformation, without introducing any additional interactions.

Resonance assignments Figure 2B shows the imino proton spectrum of native 22mer DNA without 8-bromoguanosine substitution, ODN1, in the presence of K+. The spectrum is complex because of conformational heterogeneity. Figure 2C shows the imino proton spectrum of ODN10 in the presence of K+. The 12 resonances between 10.7 and 11.9 p.p.m. are consistent with our previous report on the fold of telomeric DNA, which is composed of three guanine-tetrad planes (Fig. 1C). It is notable from the excellent spectrum that, due to stabilization or freezing of the naturally occurring major structure by proper incorporation of 8-bromoguanosines, heterogeneity is largely repressed and virtually a single conformation prevails. The melting temperature of ODN10 in K+ solution did not depend on the concentration of ODN10, which indicates that the formed structure is unimolecular. The narrow NMR line width of  4 Hz for nonexchangeable protons at 25 °C also supports the formation of a unimolecular structure. Figure 2D shows the imino proton spectrum of ODN10 in the presence of Na+. In contrast to in the presence of K+, a very broad and poor spectrum was obtained. In Na+ solution, the original telomeric DNA forms an antiparallel basket-type quadruplex, in which G3, G8, G10, G15, G20 and G22 take on the syn conformation (Fig. 1A). Substitution with 8-bromoguanosines in ODN10, by contrast, forces G2, G8, G14, G15 and G20 to take on the syn conformation. It is supposed that this conflict causes destabilization of the native structure in Na+ solution and produces structural heterogeneity resulting in the poor spectrum shown in Fig. 2D. This illustrates that it is critical that substitutions are made at the proper positions to stabilize the native structure and obtain a good spectrum suitable for structure determination. Figure 2F shows the H1¢(i-1)­H6 / H8(i)­H1¢(i) connectivities. The connectivities are interrupted at the 8-bromoguanosine positions because of the lack of H8, and thus are divided into several pieces. Based on a knowledge of the positions of 8-bromoguanosines, the number of connectivities expected for each piece can be predicted. This is utilized for the assignment. For example, eight intra- and interresidue connectivities are expected for the BrG15­A19 segment, and they are identified in Fig. 2F. The remaining ambiguity in the assignment was resolved by making use of the spectra obtained for five derivatives of ODN10, in which one of the five 8-bromoguanosines was changed back to a guanosine (Fig. 2A). A similar pattern of connectivities was observed for each derivative (Fig. 2G), which

indicates that the destabilization caused by each reverse-substitution is relatively moderate and that the structure of each derivative is rather similar to that of ODN10. These spectra for the derivatives facilitated and confirmed the assignments. As an example, the use of ODN10(G8) is explained. In the case of ODN10, the connectivities continue from A13 to BrG8 until the G9H8­G8H1¢ correlation peak and are interrupted by the absence of the following G8H8­G8H1¢ correlation peak, due to the lack of H8 for BrG8 (Fig. 2F). By contrast, in the case of ODN10(G8), in which H8 of
3548

G8 is restored, the G8H8­G8H1¢ peak can be found through horizontal walking, starting from the already identified G9H8­G8H1¢ peak (Fig. 2G). This confirms that the assignment for the BrG8­A13 segment is correct. In the same way, the assignments of the other segments were also confirmed, based on the appearance of the intraresidue H8­H1¢ correlation peak for the G residue in which H8 was restored through reverse-substitution. Thus, all of H1¢ and H6 / H8 were unambiguously assigned and confirmed by using the spectra of the five derivatives. Starting from

these assignments, the other nonexchangeable protons were also assigned, as described for other DNA [20,21,31,32]. Assignments were consistent with the H3¢(i-1)­P(i)­H5¢(i) / H5¢(i) / H4¢(i) correlation peaks of HetCor (data not shown). Imino protons (H1) of guanosines were unambiguously assigned on the basis of through-bond H8­C5 and H1­C5 correlation peaks for each guanosine in JRHMBC (Fig. 2H). The imino protons of 8-bromoguanosines were assigned in the same way based on the corresponding correlation peaks observed in the spectrum of each derivative of ODN10. In this way, all imino protons of ODN10 were unambiguously assigned. Configuration of the three guanine-tetrads Observation of imino-H8 and imino-imino NOESY cross-peaks established the formation of guaninetetrads for BrG2:BrG8:G16:BrG20, G3:G9:BrG15:G21 and G4:G10:BrG14:G22 (Fig. 3). The imino protons of guanosines / 8-bromoguanosines belonging to the G3:G9:BrG15:G21 tetrad exclusively gave strong NOESY cross-peaks to imino protons of guanines / 8-bromoguanines belonging to both the BrG2:BrG8: G16:BrG20 and G4:G10:BrG14:G22 tetrads (Fig. 3). This indicates that the G3:G9:BrG15:G21 tetrad is located between BrG2:BrG8:G16:BrG20 and G4:G10: Br G14:G22. This configuration is consistent with the finding on the H / D exchange that imino protons belonging to the G3:G9:BrG15:G21 tetrad survive in D2O (Fig. 2E). Structure of human telomeric DNA in a K+ solution The applied constraints and structural statistics for the 10 final structures are summarized in Table 1. The rmsd values for the 10 final structures versus the mean structure for all heavy atoms were ° 1.3 ± 0.3 A for a whole molecule. They were ° 0.8 ± 0.1 A for a core region. Figure 4A shows a stereoview of the superposition of the 10 final structures. A representative structure with the lowest energy is shown in Fig. 4B. Three guanine-tetrads can be seen, as already shown qualitatively. BrG2, Br G8, BrG14, BrG15 and BrG20 take on the expected syn conformation, although dihedral angle constraints to restrain these residues in the syn conformation were not explicitly included in the calculation. The other residues take on the anti conformation. Thus, one guanine-tetrad is of the syn:syn:anti:syn conformation and the other two are of the anti:anti: syn:anti conformation. The four d(GGG) guanine-

tracts take on the mixed-parallel / antiparallel, or (3+1), architecture, in which three guanine-tracts, Br G2­G3­G4, BrG8­G9­G10 and BrG20­G21­G22, are aligned parallel, and the other one, BrG14­Br G15­G16, is antiparallel. The (3+1) architecture has been observed in the structure of Tetrahymena telomeric DNA [33], the dimeric structure of human telomeric DNA [29], and the structure of a variant sequence of human bcl-2 promoter DNA [34]. The four guanine-tracts in our structure are joined with a double-chain reversal and two lateral loops along the sequence. Thus, the fold we reported previously [23,24] has now been determined at high resolution. Comparison of the structures obtained by two different strategies Last year, the fold of the mixed-parallel / antiparallel quadruplex of telomeric DNA in a K+ solution was independently determined by our group [23,24] and Ambrus et al. [25] by utilizing different strategies, which were described above. The reports by the two groups are consistent regarding the mixed-parallel / antiparallel fold. A detailed comparison is not feasible, because the structure at high resolution has not yet been reported by Ambrus et al. Very recently, the structure of the mixed-parallel / antiparallel quadruplex at high resolution was reported by Luu et al. [26]. They used a similar strategy for mutations to that used by Ambrus et al. [25]. Their structure and ours are similar with regards to the region of the guanine tracts. However, a difference was seen for loops connecting the guanine tracts between the two structures stabilized by means of different strategies. Figure 5A shows the comparison for a T11­A13 loop between the two structures. The T11­A13 loop forms a compact structure in our case, in which all three bases are closely located. In their case, the T12 (which corresponds to our T11) base points downward and the A14 (which corresponds to our A13) base flips out. It is likely that an additional reversed Watson­Crick A:T base pair between T13 (which corresponds to our T12) and a non-native adenosine A24 (no corresponding residue in our sequence) distorted the structure of this loop in their case. It should be noted that our sequence does not contain the mutation and that an additional base pair involving a non-native residue is not present. For a T17­A19 loop, although the similarity is seen to some extent between the two structures, T17 (which corresponds to their T18) points rather downward in our case (Fig. 5B), which is supported by many experimental distance constraints. The numbers of intra- and

Discussion
By substituting guanosines with 8-bromoguanosines, this study revealed the formation of a mixed-parallel / antiparallel quadruplex at high resolution for telomeric DNA, d[AGGG(TTAGGG)3], in a K+ solution. It should be noted that this sequence is the same as that for which antiparallel and parallel quadruplexes were reported under Na+ solution and K+ crystal conditions, respectively [18,19]. Despite the large amount of attention, determination of the major structure of telomeric DNA in a K+ solution has not been feasible because of conformational heterogeneity. In this study, we succeeded in demonstrating that 8-bromoguanosine is a powerful tool to overcome such difficulties. It is likely that this method with 8-bromoguanosine can be applied to structure determination of other difficult systems. We examined the possible effect of substitution with 8-bromoguanosine on a native structure. In the course of reaching ODN10, as explained, we substituted the guanosines which take on syn in a native structure. It has been pointed out that the 8-bromoguanosine substitution at a syn position does not lead to steric hindrance because the Br atom is placed in the groove [30]. Therefore, the effect of the substitution on a native structure is expected to be rather moderate. Differences between two structures by our group and Luu et al. [26] are found for loops. The loop, a TTA segment, does not contain 8-bromoguanosine. Thus, the effect of the substitution on a native loop structure should be moderate. Our T11­T12­A13 loop is more compact than that of Luu et al. [26] and three residues in the loop in our structure are located even closer to the guanine-tetrad, G4:G10:BrG14:G22, which contains 8-bromoguanosine. Therefore, steric hindrance involving 8-bromoguanosine cannot be the cause of the different loop structures. Similarly, the difference in the loop structure of a T17­T18­A19 segment is not caused by steric hindrance involving 8-bromoguanosine. We also confirmed that no steric hindrance is produced even when the guanosines in Luu et al.'s structure [26] are substituted with 8-bromoguanosine. This strongly suggests that steric hindrance involving 8-bromoguanosines is not the cause of the two different loop structures. The possibility that electrostatic interaction involving the Br atom may have some effect on a native structure not be completely excluded, although it is not likely. At present, it is not clear why a mixed-parallel / antiparallel structure is preferred in a K+ solution. This structure may allow optimal interaction between K+ ions and the carbonyl oxygen of guanosine without any

interresidue distance constraints for the T11­A13 loop are 66 and 44, respectively, in our case, and 23 and 27, respectively, for Luu et al. [26]. The numbers for the T17­A19 loop are 67 and 37, respectively, in our case, and 24 and 30, respectively, for Luu et al. [26]. Thus, our loop structures rely on more distance constraints than their loop structures. The difference was also seen for the T5­A7 loop. The difference was seen for sugar conformation, also. In our structure, all residues except for A1 exhibit sugar puckering of the B-form, C2¢-endo or C1¢-exo. In the structure of Luu et al. [26], by contrast, T7 and G15, which correspond to T6 and BrG14 of ODN10, respectively, exhibit sugar puckering of the A-form, C4¢-exo or C3¢-endo. This difference may also be related to the additional reversed Watson­Crick A:T base pair.

steric hindrance involving the guanine-tetrads and intervening three loops. Alternatively, specific interactions of K+ ions with residues of loops connecting the guanine tracts may drive formation of the mixed-parallel / antiparallel structure. Detailed energy calculations may provide a hint, but this is beyond the scope of this study. For native telomeres, it is supposed that many mixedparallel / antiparallel quadruplexes comprising four guanine tracts are formed and linked by a TTA segment between two quadruplexes. It is suggested that direct stacking of two quadruplexes is unlikely [35]. Instead, there is the possibility that the T17­A19 loop interacts with a TTA linker located between the current quadruplex and a preceding quadruplex. In fact, we identified NOE contacts between the A19 residue of the T17­A19 loop and the A1 residue, which corresponds to the first A residue of the TTA linker. This implies an interaction between the loop and the linker in native telomeres.

Similarly, the T11­A13 loop may interact with another TTA linker located between the current and following quadruplexes. It has been found that telomerase activity is inhibited by formation of the quadruplex [8­10]. Therefore, a small molecule that binds to and stabilizes the quadruplex is expected to be a candidate anticancer drug. Our structure, determined in a K+ solution, can be utilized to design and develop such a molecule. Precise structures for loops and sugars may be useful in such design and development. Determination of the unique quadruplex structure must also serve as a basis to understand the interactions of various telomere-binding proteins with telomeres. There are differences regarding loops and sugars between the two structures by our group and Luu et al. [26]. Our structure does not include the mutation and the resultant additional base pair, and this may be

responsible for these differences. When the structure is utilized to understand the higher order arrangement of telomeres and their interactions with telomere-binding proteins, and also to develop an anticancer drug, these differences may be critical. Therefore, it is important to present the structure stabilized by proper incorporation of 8-bromoguanosines, without introducing the mutation.

exchange column as described previously [31]. Each oligonucleotide was dissolved in a solution comprising 100 mm KCl, 10 mm K-phosphate (pH 6.3) and 3 mm NaN3. The concentration of each oligonucleotide was in the range 0.5­1.3 mm. Sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propane-1-sulfonate was used as an internal chemical shift reference. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by gradual cooling to room temperature prior to measurement.

Experimental procedures
Sample preparation
ODN10 and its derivatives (Fig. 2A) were synthesized and purified by HPLC as described previously [23]. Each oligonucleotide was desalted by treatment on a DEAE-cellulose column using a volatile elution buffer, i.e. triethylammonium bicarbonate. Counter cations were replaced first with pyridinium ions and then with K+ using a Dowex 50 cation-

NMR spectroscopy
NMR spectra were recorded with Bruker DRX600 and DRX800 spectrometers equipped with a cryoprobe with a Zgradient. The following NMR experiments were performed to assign the resonances, and to obtain distance and dihedral angle constraints; NOESY,1 TOCSY, DQF-COSY, 1H-13C HSQC, 1H-15N HSQC, 1H-31P HetCor and JRHMBC [36]. Spectra were processed and analyzed with xwin-nmr (Bruker), nmrpipe [37], capp / pipp / stapp [38] and sparky [39].

Distance and dihedral angle constraints
Interproton distances were calculated from NOESY spectra with mixing times of 50 and 200 ms, as described previously [20,21,32]. In total, 582 distance constraints were obtained. Dihedral angle constraints for the d, and endocyclic m0, m1, m2, m3 and m4 torsion angles were derived from the 3JH1¢­ 3 3 H2¢, JH2¢­H3¢ and JH3¢­H4¢ couplings [40,41], as described previously [20,21,31,32]. The sugar pucker was determined as follows on the basis of the results of analysis of the intensities of the H1¢­H2¢, H2¢­H3¢ and H3¢­H4¢ crosspeaks in the DQF-COSY spectrum: C2¢-endo conformation for the BrG2, G4, A7, BrG8, G10, G16, T18, A19 and Br G20 residues, C1¢-exo conformation for the G3, T5, T6, G9, T11, T12, A13, BrG14, BrG15, T17, G21 and G22 residues, and O4¢-endo conformation for the A1 residue. Sugar conformations were consistent with the C3¢ and C4¢ chemical shift values [42]. The d and endocyclic m0­m4 torsion angles of the residues taking on the C2¢-endo conformation were moderately constrained, leaving the sugar free to take on any conformation without an energy penalty between C1¢-exo and C3¢-exo including C2¢-endo in the pseudorotation cycle. In the same way, those of the residues taking on the C1¢-exo conformation were constrained between O4¢-endo and C2¢-endo including C1¢-exo, and those of A1 between C4¢-exo and C1¢-exo including O4¢-endo. It is known that the incorporation of bulky bromine at the C8 position forces a guanosine to take on the syn conformation [30]. However, a dihedral angle constraint to restrain an 8-bromoguanosine in the syn conformation was not included in the calculation, in order to avoid the bias caused by nonexperimental constraints.

Structure calculation
Structure calculations were carried out using distance and dihedral angle constraints with a simulated annealing protocol supplied with x-plor v. 3.851 [43]. Hydrogen-bonding constraints for each G:G base pair of the three tetrads were also included. Twenty final structures were selected from 100 calculations on the basis of the criteria of the smallest residual energy values. None violated the distance ° constraints by more than 0.4 A or the dihedral angle constraints by more than 7°.
