It is regretted that the following errors occurred in the above paper: The third author's name should be spelt Waldmann not Waldman. Abstract, line 7: the penultimate word should be ``complexed'' not ``complexes.'' Page 295, column 2, line 25: should read ``new potential stacking partners'' not ``now potential stacking partners.'' Legend to Figure 4; legend to Figure 6; and page 299, column 2, 6 lines from the bottom: the citation of Nicholl & Honig should appear as in the reference list and not as ``Nicholls & Honig'' as printer each time. References: The journal title in the reference by Gilliland et al. should be ``J. Immunol'' not ``Immunol.''
