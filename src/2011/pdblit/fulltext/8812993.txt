Abstract

Complexes of Con A with a-D-glycosides were studied using 1H-NMR, ESR and fluorescence methods. Correlation times, ~'c, for the interaction of the aglycon protons with the manganese ion, present at the S1 site of the protein, were calculated from T1 measurements at two frequencies. The protons of aromatic aglycons have ~'c values comparable to the rotational correlation time of the protein molecule, whereas those of non-aromatic aglycons have zcs 10 to 100 times lower. The correlation times were combined with the experimentally acquired paramagnetic contributions to proton relaxation due to the presence of the manganese ion to yield manganese-proton distances. These distances show that aromatic aglycons have additional favorable contacts with the protein which stabilize the lectin-saccharide interaction. The results are compared to the crystal structure of the methyl a-D-glycopyranoside complex with Con A and to models earlier proposed for the binding of monosaccharides to Con A.

1. Introduction

Concanavalin A (Con A) is a legume lectin with well known and very important biological properties which make it an invaluable tool in biochemical research [1]. These properties are derived from its ability to form complexes with derivatives of the specific sugars a-Dmannose and a-o-glucose. The sugars bind to Con A mostly through their terminal units [2]. In glycosides the binding constant for the Con A-sugar complex depends on the nature of the aglycon [3]. Association constants of carbohydrates to Con A have been obtained from UV spectroscopy by a technique based on their ability to displace 4-nitrophenyl a-D-mannopyranoside from its complex with the lectin [4] and from

fluorescence substitution titrations using 4-methylumbelliferyl a-D-mannopyranoside as the indicator ligand [5]. The kinetics of interaction of a- and /3-monosaccharides with Con A have been studied by fluorescence and spectral stopped-flow techniques [6-8]. The structure of Con A crystals of space group I222 has been solved by X-ray diffraction studies [9,10]. Carbon-13 and fluorine NMR relaxation measurements in aqueous solutions were used to calculate the distance of the ligands methyl a- and fl-o-glucosides and of N-trifluoroacetyl D-glucosamine from the S1 metal site of Con A and to estimate the binding orientation of the sugar [11-13]. Since the 1222 crystals of Con A dissolve on addition of saccharides, it was not possible to solve the structure of Con A-saccharide complexes until complexes of the lectin with some iododerivatives of glucose were crystallized in space group C2221:X-ray studies at 6 ,~ resolution confirmed the location of the carbohydrate binding site found earlier by NMR. In 1989 [14] the structure of the Con A complex with methyl a-D-mannopyranoside crystallized in space group P2~ 2121 was reported. We present here the results of proton NMR relaxation studies on complexes of Con A with a series of cosides. Earlier attempts to calculate distances in these complexes from proton NMR data have given results incompatible with a3C- and 19F-NMR data [15]. The nov-

elty in the present work is that correlation times were obtained experimentally for more than one protons of the ligand; their use has led to meaningful distances and to some important indications on the influence of the aglycon on the sugar binding. In the ligands studied the sugar was mannose or glucose and R was methyl, 4-nitrophenyl, 4-methylumbelliferyl, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl and TEMPO (Fig. 1).

2. Materials and methods

The synthesis of ct-PG and ot-TG was carried out according to Plessas and Goldstein [16] using slightly modified conditions [17]. The two glycosides were identified by melting points, 1H-NMR (a-PG: H-1 (5.31 3), H-I' (4.42 8), H-2' (2.40 and 2.47 8) CH 3 (1.65 and 1.67

B), H-2' (2.40 and 2.47 8) CH 3 (1.65 and 1.67 8)) or X-ray crystallography (a-TG [18]). Con A was obtained from Sigma (Type IV, highly purified, lyophilized, watersoluble), methyl a-D-mannoside, p-nitrophenyl a-D-mannoside, p-nitrophenyl OL-D-glucoside, 4'-methylumbelliferyl Ct-D-glucoside, and 4'-methylumbelliferyl a-D-mannoside from SERVA. All solvents and chemicals used in the synthesis and preparation of buffer solutions were analytical grade or purified by distillation and crystallization. The protein concentrations were measured by UV absorbance (E]8~ om= 12.4 at pH 5.6) [2]. Zn-Con A and Mn-Con A were prepared from native Con A according to Borrebaeck and Mattiason [3] with a slight modification in the technique of obtaining fragment-free Con A: the addition of NH4HCO 3 (1%, w / v ) took place in the presence of NaC1, 1 M. In this way, the process of precipitation was slowed down resulting in better yields of intact protein.

2.1. Fluorescence measurements The binding constants were calculated from fluorescence measurements using the substitution titrations method [5] on a Jasco FP 77 spectrofluorimeter at 295 K. Observed fluorescence intensities were corrected for dilution during the titration and for blanks. For each experimental point the cuvette was removed from the cavity, the appropriate amount of ligand solution was added and the samplewas thoroughly mixed by magnetic stirring. The magnet bar remained in the cuvette throughout the experiment. The substitution titrations of Con A with c~-TG using a-MUM as the fluorescent indicator ligand were carried out by first adding protein to a solution of the fluorescent ligand and measuring the decrease in intensity. When no further decrease was observed, titration with the non-fluorescent ligand was started until the new equilibrium point was reached. The equilibria holding in the system are: P + L = eL, K L = [ P L ] / [ P ] [ L ] P + I = PI, K 1= [ P l ] / [ P ] [ I ] where P denotes protein, L fluorescent indicator, I compet, ing ligand, and PL and PI the complexes of the protein with L and I, respectively. The fluorescence of the indiCator (excitation 315 nm, emission 380 n m ) i s totally. quenched in the complex PL. The competing iigand and the complex PI do not fluoresce.

The linewidth A v at half-height depends on T2 and r m. It is known that as the temperature increases r m decreases, whereas T2 and T1 in liquids increase. The temperature dependence studies are carded in the presence of excess ligand. Under these conditions Xb T2m + Zm = ~r( A v _ XfAvo) (7)

This relation holds provided % does not depend on frequency. The correlation time contains three terms: ~'R, the rotational correlation time, rs, the electron relaxation time and ~'m: l / r c = 1//'T R -{- 1/~" s + 1 / ' r m (9)

The rotational correlation time and the lifetime of the complex are independent of frequency. It was found experimentally [15] that the electron relaxation time is also independent of frequency in the region 90-270 MHz. The correlation time of TEMPO free radical in the Con A complex with a-TG was obtained from the relative intensities of the M ( - 1), M(0) and M(1) ESR peaks [19].

3. Results

3.1. Association constants
Table 1 shows the association constants, Ka, measured by fluorescence experiments. The values of K a for a-MM, ct-MG, a-PNG and a-MUM are, within experimental error, comparable to values given in the literature for these glycosides taking into consideration the differences in the temperature at which they were measured [6,7]. The association constants of a-PG and a-TG are practically identical. Since the piperidinyl and TEMPO groups are very

close in structure, differing only at position 4 of the heterocyclic ring, it is expected that they would behave, as far as the lectinic interaction is concerned, in similar ways. We have shown previously that free TEMPOL quenches the fluorescence of Con A (excitation band at 295 nm, emmission at 340 nm) with an apparent association constant K ' = 9.2.103 M -1 [17]. Addition of a-MM does not perturb the TEMPOL-Con A interaction.TEMPOL does not displace a-MUM from the lectin sugar binding site. Substitution titration of the a-MUM-Con A complex with TEMPOL yielded a negative K a (Table 1) the absolute value of which is of the order of the experimental error. Consequently, a-TG has two modes of interaction with Con A, one as a glycoside (lectinic interaction) and a second as a nitroxide quenching non specifically the aromatic fluorophores on the surface of the protein, not necessarily those situated in the vicinity of the sugar binding site.

3.2. Lifetimes of complexes
A plot of log ( X J T r ( A u - Xf Avo)) vs. 1 / T is given in Fig. 2. The curve shows the dependence of the sum T2M + ~'m on temperature. In the region 274 to 295 K T2M does not change appreciably while the exchange rate goes from slow to intermediate. Therefore the change in the quantity A v - X f A v o reflects the change in the lifetime of the complex: the tangent to the experimental curve labelled ~'m is used to obtain ~'m at a given temperature. Above 295 K T2M starts increasing because the spin-spin relaxation process is slowed down and this accounts for the change in slope of the experimental curve. At 293 K the lifetimes of the Con A complexes studied here are comparable: a mean value ~'m = 0.0015 s was used for the calculations of T1p.

a Ka for u-MUG, ot-PNM and a - P N G measured at 298 K are taken from

3.3. Times and distances f r o m M n 2 +

Correlation times were calculated for the ligand protons of Con A complexes with a-MUM, a-PNM and a-PG. Because of technical reasons measurements of T1 in the complexes with a-PNG and a-MUG were performed only at one frequency (100 MHz). For the calculation of proton

distances in these complexes it was assumed that the correlation times of the corresponding mannosides(a-PNM and a-MUM) could be used. Tables 2 and Table 3 show the relaxation parameters obtained at 100 and 200 MHz, 293 K. The correlation times for ligand protons calculated from the above data are given in Table 4. Fig. 3 shows that accurate correlation times can be calculated only if the

The values of ~'c range from 10 -8 to 1 0 - 1 ° S. In previous NMR studies for the determination of ligand distance from the S1 site in Con A-glycoside complexes a single ~'c was used for all ligand nuclei [11-15]. As far as the pyrannose carbons are concerned this is a good approx-

Therefore it is safer to use experimentally determined rc's to obtain distances from the Solomon-Bloembergen equation. Our experimental results show that the ligand protons in each complex are characterized by individual correlation times reflecting their individual mobilities. Two groups of protons can be distinguished: In the first, ~-c is of the order of 10 -8 s, that is of the order of r R, the rotational correlation time of the protein-glycoside complex as obtained from fluorescence measurements [21], in the second, r c is of the order of 10 -1° to 10 - 9 S. To the first group belong the aromatic protons of a-PNM, a-PNG and aMUM; clearly those are more strongly bound to the protein. To the second group belong the methyl group and hydrogen-3' of a-MUM and the piperidinyl protons of a-PG. The decrease in r~ of the a-MUM methyl protons

must be due to the rotation of the methyl group; hydrogen-3' which is coupled to methyl ( J = 1.3 Hz) is probably relaxing through it [22]. In the case of a-PG the correlation time reflects the freedom of motion of the piperidinyl group as a whole. For a-TG, where NMR T1 measurements cannot be carried because of the presence of the free electron, freedom of motion of TEMPO was detected by ESR. The ESR spectra of the Con A - a-TG complex are expected to be a superposition of spectra of the free and bound ligand in equilibrium. The spectrum of the free ligand consists of three sharp equidistant peaks. Protein-bound nitroxides give in general broadened unsymmetrical spectra due to the reduction in mobility of the free radical. Working with the complex of TEMPO-a-D-galactopyranoside and Griffonia simplicifolia I isolectin A4, which has a dissociation constant of 8 . 1 0 - 5 M , Goldstein et al. [23] were able to detect a decrease in the intensity of the free spectral component and the appearance of new broad lines due to the lectin-bound fraction. We obtained ESR spectra of a-TG in the presence of twofold excess protein. Under these conditions, according to the value of Ka, the association constant of the complex, 18% of the ligand should be bound. However, new lines attributable to immobilized TEMPO did not appear; there was only a broadening of the triplet lines (Fig. 4) implying that the correlation time of the bound nitroxide is much smaller than the rotational correlation time of the protein complex. From the relative intensities of the M ( - 1), M(0) and M(1) ESR peaks we estimated the correlation times of the bound nitroxide to be 1.5.10 -1° s, two orders of magnitude lower than r R of the protein complex. It appears that the TEMPO group is not interacting with the protein surface but is ' hanging' out of the binding site. Table 5 gives distances, r, of ligand protons from the metal ion. All distances conform with the molecular geometry of the ligands and are in agreement with 13C and 19F-NMR data [11-15].

4. Discussion Correlation times and distances obtained from NMR data are averaged over an ensemble of conformations [24]. In this respect they reflect more truly the actual situation in biological systems than the crystallographic data. Indeed, more than one crystal structures have been obtained for Con A and its complexes with simple sugars. This may be due to slight conformational changes of the binding site induced by cooperative effects of sugar substituents in general and, more precisely, by the nature of the aglycon in glycosides. Accordingly, one should not expect identical orientations for all mannosides or glucosides binding to Con A. The only X-ray crystallographic study detailing the saccharide binding concerns the Con A complex to an

alkyl mannoside (a-MM) [14]. The a-anomeric substituent of carbon-1 is directed out of the site making no contact with the protein; no electron density is detected for the methyl group. Crystal structures for Con A complexes with aryl glycosides are not available. A study of the ability of recta-substituted alkylphenyl fl-o-glucopyranosides to inhibit the binding of Con A to polysaccharides [25] has provided evidence for the existence of a relatively non-polar area adjacent to the specific carbohydrate binding site which could accommodate aromatic structures attached to the anomeric oxygen. The correlation between the inhibiting potencies of the arylglucosides and the Hammett electronic substituent constant was poor indicating that 7r-rr charge-transfer bonding is not a dominant factor in determining the binding t o Con A. It was suggested that interactions of aromatic aglycons with alkyl side chains may be responsible for the cooperative effects observed. The results on R-ot-o-glucosides and R-ot-o-mannosides presented here support this hypothesis. The binding constant K a (Table 1) is larger for R =-aryl, increasing for

glycosides from tetramethylpiperidinyl and tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl to methyl, p-nitrophenyl and 4-methylumbelliferyl substituents in that order. A similar trend is observed in mannosides. In a model proposed for the binding of a-MG to Con A [26] the methyl group is pointing outside onto the surface of the protein in agreement with the X-ray results for a-MM. The correlation time and proton distance data for a-PG and a-TG given in Tables 4 and 5 also indicate that the alkyl aglycons are pointing to the surrounding solvent. Because of the size of the piperidinyl and TEMPO groups an additional factor of steric hindrance comes into play which seems to perturb the binding so that the association constants for a-PG and a-TG are less than for a-MG (Table 1). It is noteworthy that the correlation times of non-aromatic protons presented here are of the same order of magnitude (10-1° to 10 -9 s) as those reported by Fuhr et al [15] for the methyl group of a-MG. However, the distances calculated from their data are not compatible with the position of the sugar binding site as determined from X-ray crystallography. They have assumed, for calculating distances, that outer sphere relaxation of the unbound ligand by the bound manganese ion makes an important contribution to Tlf. It turns out that this is not true. Correlation times of glucoside aryl protons (a-PNG and a-MUG) are not available since we were not able to perform T1 measurements at two frequencies. We can safely assume that they are of the same order to those measured for arylmannosides (Table 4). In arylmannosides the protons of aromatic aglycons have zc values comparable to the rotational correlation time of the protein molecules suggesting that they are firmly held to the lectin binding site. In a model which we have proposed earlier for the binding of a-PNM to Con A (Fig. 5), based on semi-empirical energy calculations and interactive graphics, we have indicated the possibility of some favorable interactions of the aglycon with the protein as, for exam-

ple, the formation of a hydrogen bond involving 0 7 of the NO 2 and OG1 of T226 [27]. This is in good agreement with the results of the inhibition studies. On the contrary, the orientation of the p-nitrophenyl group in our model is not compatible with the specific 7r-Tr interaction of the aromatic ring with the residues Y12 and Y100 of Con A proposed by Farina and Wilkins [6]. Fig. 4 shows that, in the model, the tyrosine residues are at the entrance of the sugar binding site, whereas the aromatic ring of a-PNM is lying on a groove of the protein with the NO 2 group near residue T226. Notice that the distances reported for the p-nitrophenyl protons of a-PNM in our earlier paper were r = 13.84 A for H-2' and r = 15.09 ,~ for H-Y vs. a mean value r = 14.83 ,~ for the aromatic protons given in the present paper. Although the difference is well within experimental error we trust more the present result obtained on more modern equipment. The distances of the aromatic protons from the manganese ion reported in Table 5 imply that the same protein region might accommodate the aryl aglycons of both glucosides and mannosides. Our results show that the Solomon-Bloembergen equation can be applied to 1H-NMR relaxation data to obtain meaningful distances of ligand protons from protein paramagnetic centers provided the correct correlation times are used. Besides, the values of r c for these protons provide, per se, a measure of their interaction with the protein and can be used to estimate their involvement in cooperative effects on the sugar binding.
