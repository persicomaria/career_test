Many lines of evidence reveal that bisphenol A (BPA) functions at very low doses as an endocrine disruptor. The human estrogen-related receptor c (ERRc) behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription, although the endogenous ligand is unknown. We have recently demonstrated that BPA binds strongly to ERRc (KD = 5.5 nM), but not to the estrogen receptor (ER). BPA preserves the ERRc's basal constitutive activity, and protects the selective ER modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen from its deactivation of ERRc. In order to shed light on a molecular mechanism, we carried out the X-ray analysis of crystal structure of the ERRc ligand-binding domain (LBD) complexed with BPA. BPA binds to the receptor cavity without changing any internal structures of the pocket of the ERRc-LBD apo form. The hydrogen bonds of two phenol-hydroxyl groups, one with both Glu275 and Arg316, the other with Asn346, anchor BPA in the pocket, and surrounding hydrophobic bonds, especially with Tyr326, complete BPA's strong binding. Maintaining the `activation helix' (helix 12) in an active conformation would as a result preserve receptor constitutive activity. Our results present the first evidence that the nuclear receptor forms complexes with the endocrine disruptor, providing detailed molecular insight into the interaction features. Key words: binding assay, bisphenol A, estrogen-related receptor c (ERRc), nuclear receptor, X-ray crystal structure.

Bisphenol A (BPA), 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, has a symmetrical chemical structure of HO-C6H4-C(CH3)2C6H4-OH. BPA is used mainly in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Its worldwide manufacture is $3.2 million metric tons per year. BPA had been acknowledged as an estrogenic chemical able to interact with human estrogen receptors (ERs) (1, 2). In recent years, many lines of evidence reveal that BPA functions at its very low doses as an endocrine disruptor (3­7). All of these so-called `low-dose effects' of BPA have been explained as the output effects of steroid hormone receptor ERs (8). However, since BPA's binding to ER and hormonal activity is extremely weak, 1,000­10,000 times lower than for natural hormones, the intrinsic significance of low-dose effects has been intangible and obscure. BPA's low-dose effects have been peerreviewed by the National Toxicology Program of the

United States (9), and extensively reviewed by vom Saal and Hughes (7). The discrepancy on low-dose effects prompted us to enquire whether BPA may interact with nuclear receptors (NRs) other than ER, and as a BPA receptor we have recently identified the human estrogenrelated receptor g (ERRg) (10). The ERRg belongs to the orphan subfamily of NRs (11), all members of which (ERRa, ERRb and ERRg) are closely related to ERs (12, 13). ERRg behaves as a constitutive activator of transcription, presumably with intrinsic roles in differentiation and maturation of the foetal brain. Although the endogenous ligand is unknown, we have shown that BPA binds strongly to ERRg, but not to ER (10). BPA preserves the ERRg's basal constitutive activity, and protects the selective ER modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) from its deactivation of ERRg. In order to explain such BPA's activities at the structural basis, we carried out the crystallization of the ERRg ligand-binding domain (LBD) complexed with BPA. We here report the structure of the complex and shed light on a molecular mechanism between BPA and 517

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A. Matsushima et al. column of glutathione-sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). GST was cleaved on the resin by using a specific enzyme, PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences), for 4 h at 48C. After incubation, ERRgLBD was eluted and its concentration determined by the Bradford method using a CBB solution (14). Crystallization of Protein Complex Followed by X-Ray Data Collection and Processing--Purified ERRg-LBD was concentrated by ultrafiltration. Co-crystallization with a 3-fold molar excess of BPA was carried out with the hanging drop vapour diffusion method. The crystals used for data collection were from a drop of 2 ml of ERRg-LBD solution mixed with BPA and 2 ml of reservoir solution (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.75 M sodium citrate and 5% glycerol). For data collection, crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant solution containing 24% glycerol in reservoir solution, then mounted in a nylon loop and flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the beamline BL38B1, SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). The data were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 package (16). Structure Determination and Refinement--A monomer model of ERRg-LBD/4-OHT (1S9Q) was used as a search molecule for molecular replacement using MOLREP (17) in CCP4 (18). The position of the monomer in the asymmetric unit was located and the structure refined ° at 1.6 A using REFMAC5 (19) in CCP4. Manual adjustment and rebuilding of the model including BPA and water molecules were performed using the program Coot (20). The final model contained residues 232­458 of ERRg, one BPA, three glycerol and 387 water molecules. Multiple conformers were applied to Lys236, Ser239, Ile249, Tyr250, Val278, Lys284, Ser290, Met298, Ser303, Ser319, Ser358, Ile382, Gln389, Asp393, Gln400, Asp401, Gln406, His407, Met419, Ser428, Gln433 and Leu454. The final model was validated with PROCHECK (21). Date collection and structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Minimum-energy Calculations--For the energy calculations of the geometry optimization of BPA, the conventional Hartree­Fock (HF) method was used on a computer program Gaussian (v. 03) with the 6-31G(d, p) basis set.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Materials--3-[3-(Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]1-propanesulfonic acid (CHAPS), EDTA, HEPES and g-globulin were obtained from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). Glycerol was from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto), and all other chemicals used were of analytical grade and purchased from Wako (Osaka). Methods--The concentration of nuclear receptor protein was estimated by the Bradford method (14) using the protein assay solution with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) (Nacalai Tesque). Mass spectra of proteins were measured on a mass spectrometer VoyagerTM DE-PRO (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA, USA) using the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) method. Construction of Recombinant Plasmid--The cDNA fragment encoding human ERRg-LBD (corresponding to amino acid residues 222­458) were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from kidney QUICKCloneTM cDNA (Clonetech, Mountain View, CA, USA) using specific primers. The amplified product was cloned into the expression vector pGEX 6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) using EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites to express the product as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Site-directed Mutagenesis of ERR--The constructed plasmid were served as a template for Ala-substituted mutants. The PCR method was carried out to introduce the single-point mutations by using a series of overlapping sense and antisense primer pairs. The PCR fragments containing the E275A, M306A, L309A, R316A, Y326A, N346A and F435A mutations were cut with EcoRI and XhoI, and then subcloned into the expressing vector pGEX 6P-1. Saturation Binding Assay--Saturation binding assay was conducted essentially as reported (15) at 48C overnight to minimize degradation of the ligand receptor complex in a final volume of 100 ml of binding buffer [10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM CHAPS and 2 mg/ml g-globulin]. GST-ERRg-LBD of 30­3000 ng and [3H]BPA (185 GBq/mmol, America Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St Louis, MO, USA) with or without addition of unlabelled BPA (final concentration of 10 mM) to quantify the non-specific binding. Free radio-ligand was removed by centrifugation (48C, 10 min, 14,000 r.p.m.) or filtration after incubation with 100 ml of 1% dextran-coated charcoal (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) in PBS (pH 7.4) for 10 min at 48C. Specific binding of [3H]BPA was calculated by subtracting the non-specific binding from the total binding. Protein Expression and Purification--GST fusion protein of the ERRg-LBD was expressed by using Escherichia coli BL21 as described previously (10). Purification was carried out by using an affinity

Dimeric Structure of ERR-LBD--The crystals usable for data collection were obtained from a ERRg-LBD solution mixed with BPA in the following reservoir solution: 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.75 M sodium citrate and 5% glycerol. We solved the crystal structure of the resulting ERRg-LBD in a complex with BPA at a ° resolution of 1.6 A (space group P41212) (Table 1). The ERRg-LBD crystallized in homodimeric form using crystallographic 2-fold symmetry, indicating that BPA binding does not interfere with homodimer formation (Fig. 1A). Homodimer formation of the purified ERRgLBD is also observed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 2), in agreement with the reported homodimeric binding of ERRs to DNA (22). A BPA molecule in the complex with ERRg-LBD is defined very well from its electron density (Fig. 1B).

ERRg binds to the ERR-response element (ERRE), but as a monomer. ERRg can also bind to functional estrogen response elements (EREs) in ER target genes, suggesting a possible overlap between ERR and ER action (12). Homodimers formed by the hydrophobic interactions between the interfaces of a-helix 10 (H10), which is supported by a-helix 7 (H7). Thus, in a homodimer, four a-helices are arranged in tandem to form the sequence H7­H10­H10­H7 (Fig. 1A, right). In the dimerization interface of H10­H10, such amino acid

pairs as Pro422­Pro422, Arg425­Gln426 and Gln426­ Arg425 appear to make a specific intermolecular interaction (Fig. 3A; the residues in italic characters are of the second molecule of ERRg dimer). At the interface between H7 and H10, Tyr356­Thr420 and Met359­ Met417 pairs are likely to underlie the intramolecular interaction (Fig. 3B). Leu418 and Leu421 in H10 are oriented towards the centre of the ERRg-LBD and are conserved among almost all the NRs. In addition, almost all NRs conserve Leu399 in H9, and this Leu399 together with Leu418 and Leu421 in H10 take part in forming a hydrophobic core, which probably plays an intrinsic role in structural construction for homodimerization (Fig. 3C). Binding Site of Bisphenol A--The binding site of BPA is constructed by a series of amino acid residues.

Matsushima et al. ° Those in a range of 5 A include Leu268, Cys269, Leu271, Ala272, Glu275 from H3; Trp305, Met306, Leu309, Val313, Arg316 from H5; Tyr326 from b-strand 1 (S1); Leu342, Leu345, Asn346, Ile349 from H7; Phe435 from H11 and Phe450 from H12 (Fig. 4A). In the BPA molecule, the two C6H4­OH (phenol) groups bind to the sp3 carbon atom (sp3-C) together with the two CH3 groups, and thus their benzene-carbons adjacent to sp3-C are arranged at the vertexes in a regular tetrahedron (Fig. 4B). It should be noted that BPA in the ERRg-LBD complex is superimposed almost completely with BPA in the minimum-energy conformation (Fig. 4B). This demonstrates that BPA is present in the ERRg-LBD binding pocket without any steric hindrance. Thus, BPA's phenol-hydroxyl oxygen atoms, C6H4­OH, are placed with a bond angle (O­sp3­C­ O) of about 1058, and are arranged to cross-link between Glu275/Arg316 and Asn346.

Superimposition of BPA (red) with DES (green) or 4-OHT (cyan) is carried out for a-helices to be overlaid. H12 in the BPA/ERRg-LBD complex are shown in purple in all figures. H12 in the DES/ERRg-LBD complex and in the 4-OHT/ERRg-LBD complex are widely separated from a position in the activation conformation, and thus those are out of superimpositions between the BPA/ERRgLBD and the DES/ERRg-LBD and 4­OHT/ERRg-LBD complexes (C and D, respectively).

One of the two phenol-hydroxyl groups of BPA is anchored by hydrogen bonds with Glu275 (H3) and Arg316 (H5) at the one side of the ligand-binding pocket (LBP), while another hydroxyl group makes a hydrogen bond with Asn346 in H7 at the other side (Fig. 4C). Thus, BPA cross-links the residues Glu275/Arg316 and Asn346 with three hydrogen bonds. This is in stark contrast to the fact that diethylstilbestrol (DES) cross-links Glu275/ Arg316 and His434 in H11 on the other side of the cavity (23). BPA's phenol-hydroxyl groups are not far enough apart to bridge between these Glu275/Arg316 and His434. Key Amino Acid Tyr326 for Binding of Bisphenol A-- Asn346 (H7) has been reported to interact with Tyr326 in S1 through a hydrogen bond (23, 24). This hydrogen bond is also maintained in the BPA/ERRg-LBD complex. In particular, we found that Tyr326 in the complex becomes the chief amino acid residue for BPA to be placed in the ERRg-LBP, providing an appropriate and fitting space to pack BPA, having two phenol groups and two methyl groups. More importantly, Tyr326 interacts directly with BPA. The phenol group of the Tyr326 side chain keeps BPA's phenol-benzene rings A and B in the pocket by two strong interactions; i.e. by the hydrophobic edge-to-face-type, or T-shaped / interaction with BPA's benzene ring A, and by the OH/ interaction with BPA's benzene ring B (Fig. 4D and E). The Tyr-phenol benzene ring is able to make T-shaped / interactions with the aromatic side chains of amino acids such as Phe, Tyr, His and Trp (25, 26). When one of six edges or vertexes of the benzene ring directs towards the  face of the counterpart aromatic ring, it makes so-called T-shaped / interaction(s). As seen in Fig. 4D, Tyr326's benzene ring indeed
Vol. 142, No. 4, 2007

make a T-shaped / interaction with BPA's benzene ring A. It should be noted that, at another  face on the opposite side, BPA's A ring interacts further with the Leu309 isobutyl-methyl groups (Fig. 4D). This interaction is also classified as a CH/-type hydrophobic interaction. Consequently, there is a fascinating formation of sandwiched hydrophobic interactions of the A ring with Leu309 and Tyr326 (Fig. 4D). This is definitely a powerful driving force holding BPA in the LBD of ERRg. The Tyr326-phenol hydroxyl group makes another important interaction with BPA's benzene ring B. As shown in Fig. 4E, these are an OH/ interaction (27, 28). OH/ interactions are one of the strongest interactions between amino acid side-chains (25, 26). As a result, BPA's phenol B is tethered in the ERRg-LBP complex by two essential interactions, the hydrogen bond with Asn346 and the OH/ bond with Tyr326. It is noteworthy that Tyr326 has multiple interactions with BPA. In fact, Tyr326 might be in an ideal position to accept BPA in the ERRg-LBP complex. When superimposition between ERRg-LBD from the BPA/ERRg-LBD complex and the ERRg-LBD apo form (PDB code 1TFC) (23, 24) was carefully checked, significant deviation was found for the Tyr326-phenol group (Fig. 5A and B). As shown in Fig. 5B, the Tyr326-phenol group in the BPA/ ERRg-LBD complex is pulled towards Asn346, shifting it through an angle of approximately 108. This deviation keeps Tyr326-phenol group in the range of still stronger ° hydrogen bonds with Asn346, at a distance of 2.7 A. All other amino acid residues in LBD are in exact agreement. In particular, the inside of the pocket is totally compatible with that of the apo form (Fig. 5A).

Interaction of Methyl Groups in Bisphenol A--BPA also has two methyl groups on the sp3-C atom. One of these faces Phe435 (H11), and indeed the BPA-CH3 and ° Phe435-phenyl groups are in close proximity (3.7 A) to each other (Fig. 4F). On the other hand, another BPACH3 group faces the Met306 sulphur atom with a non° covalent electron pair (3.6 A between BPA-CH3 and Met306-S) (Fig. 4F) making a form of electrostatic interaction. These interactions have been demonstrated by the drastically decreased binding activity that occurs in hexafluoro-BPA (designated as bisphenol AF), HO­C6H4­C(CF3)2­C6H4­OH, in which both CH3 groups in BPA are replaced with trifluoromethyl CF3 group. Electron-rich CF3 would repel the electron-rich Phe-phenyl group and the Met-sulphur atom. As mentioned earlier, BPA in the ERRg-LBD complex is superimposed almost completely with BPA in the minimum-energy conformation (Fig. 4B). This implies that BPA fits spontaneously to the binding pocket of ERRg-LBD without any conformational constraints, and binds specifically to each attachment position. It is likely that ERRg possesses a binding pocket specifically adapted to the space requirements of the naturally occurring BPA-like ligand.

Superimposition of Bisphenol A/ERR-LBD Complex with Other Complexes--Superimposition of BPA and DES (1S9P) (23) in the ERRg-LBD complexes shows conformational differences that can readily account for the differences in binding modes to the binding pocket. The phenol A ring of BPA superimposes almost completely with the corresponding A ring of DES, whereas the B rings orient in completely different directions (Fig. 5C). As a result, the phenol B ring of BPA heads towards H7 to capture Asn346 by its hydrogen bond, while that of DES goes towards H11 to restrain His434 also by a hydrogen bond. Superimposition of the BPA complex and the 4-OHT complex (1S9Q) (23) of ERRg-LBD, on the other hand, shows structural differences that make clear the difference in their activity mediated through the ERRg. As before, the phenol A ring of BPA superimposes almost completely with the corresponding A ring of 4-OHT (Fig. 5D). Incontrast, the aromatic B ring of 4-OHT goes towards H11 with no hydrogen bond. The aromatic C ring of 4-OHT directs itself towards H12. Greschik et al. (23) have reported that the binding of DES and 4-OHT to ERRg-LBD dissociates the H12 region from the LBD body.

X-ray Crystal Structure of ERR Receptor Complex with Bisphenol A activities were explained by the three-dimensional structure of the DES/or 4-OHT/ERRg-LBD complex, in which helix 12 is widely separated from a position in the activation conformation. Indeed, their H12s are out of superimpositions between the BPA/ERRg-LBD and the DES/ or 4­OHT/ERRg-LBD complexes (Fig. 5C and D). This repositioning of H12 by DES and 4-OHT deactivates ERRg, because the receptor becomes unable to recruit coactivator proteins at the appropriate position. The LBD structure of ERRg apo form has also been solved (23, 24), and as expected from its very high constitutive activity, H12 of this non-liganded ERRg-LBD is folded in the activation conformation (Fig. 5A). Bisphenol A Holds ERR-LBD in the Activation Conformation--One of the most important findings in the present study is that H12 in the BPA/ERRg-LBD complex is in the transcriptionally active conformation. H12 is associated firmly with the LBD body, where the coactivator binds. When we compared this crystal structure with the reported crystal structure (1TFC) of the apo form of ERRg-LBD (23), almost no conformational changes were shown for almost all the atoms including both the main and side chains from H1 to H12 (Fig. 5A). Superimposition of the ERRg-LBD from the BPA/ERRg-LBD complex and the apo ERRg-LBD shows their exact and entire agreement. In particular, the positioning and conformation of H12 is totally compatible with that of the apo form (Fig. 5A and B). Although H12's activation conformation in the apo form appeared to be maintained by the presence of a peptide derived from the coactivator protein SRC-1, H12 in the BPA/ ERRg-LBD complex is in fact in the activation conformation without the SRC-1 peptide. These conformational consequences verify the high functional activity of BPA. ERRg per se elicits a very high basal activity in the luciferase reporter gene assay. BPA was found to maintain this high spontaneous constitutive activity in ERRg for a range of concentrations from 10À10 to 10À5 M BPA (10). Furthermore, BPA reverses the deactivation activity of 4-OHT, indicating that BPA displaces 4-OHT and repositions the H12 from the transcriptionally inactive conformation to the active conformation. It should be noted that the compounds that deactivate the receptor are termed as `inverse agonist,' whereas those that inhibit such inverse agonists are defined as `inverse antagonist.' Thus, BPA indeed acts as an inverse antagonist against the inverse agonist 4-OHT in ERRg. Structural Demonstration of the Binding Sites by Sitedirected Mutagenesis--The amino acid residues in the BPA-binding site of ERRg-LBD were substituted with Ala by means of the site-directed mutagenesis. Those included Glu275, Met306, Leu309, Arg316, Tyr326, Asn346 and Phe435 in the binding pocket. The resulting mutant receptors were examined by the saturation binding assay using tritium-labelled BPA (Fig. 6A and B). When Glu275 and Arg316 were substituted simultaneously, the mutant receptor exhibited almost no specific binding (Fig. 6C), indicating that these residues are critically important to bind BPA to the pocket. In contrast, [3H]BPA was found to bind to Asn346Ala mutant receptor (Bmax = 18.5 nmol/mg) as well as

wild-type receptor (18.2 nmol/mg), although its binding affinity for the mutant was approximately 2-fold weaker (KD = 9.51 nM) than that for the wild-type (5.54 nM) (Fig. 6D). All other mutant receptors exhibited considerably reduced specific binding and drastically weakened binding ability (10­20-fold larger KD values). The results clearly evidenced that the structural elements complementary to BPA are indeed its binding sites. Conclusion and Perspectives--The present study clearly indicates that the nuclear receptor ERRg possesses a space in its LBD to which BPA can bind highly specifically and selectively. It is still not clear whether, under physiological conditions, ERRg can function without an endogenous ligand, nor what ERRg's physiological functions may be. The results we present imply that ERRg may in fact have a BPA-like endogenous ligand, and will facilitate the design of novel specific agonist and antagonist compounds. The binding affinity of [3H]BPA to ERRg-LBD is extremely high, with a KD value of 5.5 nM. Thus, it is an immediate and important requirement to evaluate whether the previously reported effects of BPA at low doses are mediated through ERRg and its specific target gene(s). At the same time, it is necessary to clarify what the physiological roles of ERRg are, and to examine the extent of, and direction in which, BPA may influence these. This is particularly important because ERRg is expressed in a tissue-restricted manner, for example, very strongly in the mammalian foetal brain and also in the placenta, at sites that could have important outcomes for the newborn.
