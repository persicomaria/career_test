The structural relationships between histone-binding proteins and DNA-binding proteins are important, since nucleosome-interacting factors possess histone-binding and/or DNA-binding components. S. cerevisiae (Sc) Cia1p/Asf1p, a homologue of human CIA (CCG1-interacting factor A), is the most evolutionarily conserved histone chaperone, which facilitates nucleosome assembly by interacting with the nucleosome entry site of the core histones H3/H4. The crystal structure of the evolutionarily conserved domain (residues 1­169) of Cia1p (ScCia1p-DC2) was determined at 2.95 s resolution. The refined model contains 166 residues in the asymmetric unit. The overall tertiary structure resembles a b-sandwich fold, and belongs to the ``switched'' immunoglobulin class of proteins. The crystal structure suggests that ScCia1p-DC2 is structurally related to the DNAbinding proteins, such as NF-jB and its family members. This is the first examination of the structural similarities between a histone chaperone and DNA-binding proteins. We discuss the possibilities that the strands b3 and b4, which possess highly electronegative surface potentials, are the important regions for the interaction with core histones, and that the histone chaperone ScCia1p/Asf1p and the DNA-binding protein NF-jB may have evolved from the same prototypal protein class. Key words: ASF1, chaperone, CIA, gene regulation, NFAT, NF-jB, nucleosome, p53, structure, transcription.

Eukaryotic genomic DNA is wrapped around the core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, resulting in a nucleoprotein complex called the nucleosome (1). The regulation of the interactions between DNA and histones is important for controlling the active and/or inactive states of DNA (2), and is modulated by three types of chromatin-associated factors: histone modification enzymes, nucleosome remodeling factors and histone chaperones (3­5). To assemble and disassemble nucleosome efficiently, these chromatinassociated factors should interact with and modify the DNA and/or core histones (2). In fact, the complexes involving histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and nucleosome remodeling ATPase contain both DNA- and histone-interactive

subunits (6). However, although the possibility that histone chaperones themselves might have inherited DNA-binding domains is intriguing, it is not known whether histone chaperones contain DNA-binding subunits, and the binding mode of histone chaperones to nucleosomal DNA has yet to be elucidated. Human histone chaperone CIA (hCIA; CCG1-interacting factor A) was isolated as an interacting factor of the bromodomain of CCG1/TAF1/TAFII250 (7, 8), the largest subunit of TFIID (9, 10). CIA is the most conserved histone chaperone, and it shares high sequence conservation with its yeast homologue (anti-silencing function-1; ScCia1p/ Asf1p) (11, 12). Both hCIA and ScCia1p/Asf1p have nucleosome assembly activity (7, 12), and ScCia1p also has the ability to disassemble nucleosomes (13, 14). CIA binds to histone H3 through (i) the region responsible for the formation of the (H3/H4)2 tetramer (15), and (ii) the starting and ending points of the interactive region between the core histones and DNA in the nucleosome core particle (7, 16). Although little evidence exists for the involvement of the histone chaperone CIA in the DNA-binding reactions, previous studies implied that CIA itself also contains a DNA-binding motifs in addition to the histone-binding motif: (i) CIA regulates several DNA-mediated reactions, including transcription (8, 13), gene silencing (10, 17, 18), DNA replication (19­21), DNA repair (22­25), cell cycle 821

822 (11, 26), cell death (27), and spermatogenesis (28), and (ii) CIA interacts with various proteins that function in DNA/ nucleosome-mediated reactions, including histone acetyltransferases CCG1 (7, 8) and the SAS complex (17, 18), the core histones H3 and H3/H4 (7, 19), the transcription corepressors Hir1p and Hir2p (29, 30), the DNA repair factor Rad53 (22, 23), the DNA replication factor C (RFC) (20), the Tousled-like kinase (31), the histone chaperone CAF-I (24), and the chromatin remodeling ATPase brahma complex (32). Several DNA-binding domains exist among DNAbinding proteins, and the domains utilized in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes differ from each other. In addition, there are many DNA-binding proteins that interact not only with naked DNA but also with nucleosomal DNA (33). For example, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding to its recognition sequence within the nucleosome results in the disruption of the local chromatin structure, the assembly of a transcriptional complex over the TATA box, and the induction of transcriptional activation (34). GR is well suited to interact specifically with nucleosomal DNA, with only a slight reduction in its affinity relative to naked DNA. This interaction is dependent on the precise position of the nucleosome as well as the translational position of the GR-binding site within the nucleosome (33). In addition, the activated GR complexes bind tightly to histones H3 and H4 (35). Although the relationship between these naked/nucleosomal DNA-binding domains and histonebinding domains is still unclear, these studies have provided information leading to a possible interaction mechanism of DNA-binding proteins with nucleosomal DNA and core histones. Thus, the possibility that DNA-binding proteins and histone chaperones are structurally and functionally related to each other should be investigated. In our previous study, we reported the purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic studies of ScCia1p-DC2 (comprising residues 1­169 of Cia1p), which has nucleosome assembly activity (12, 36). Here we report the tertiary structure of ScCia1p-DC2 at 2.95 s resolution, and discuss the surprising result that it shares structural similarities with several eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

B. Padmanabhan et al. factor Xa (Amersham Biosciences) at 20 C for 16 h. Benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the mixture to remove the factor Xa. The ScCia1p-DC2 fraction was loaded on a Poros QE column (Applied Biosystems), which was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.2 to 1.5 M NaCl, and then the protein was fractionated by gel filtration on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prepgrade column (Amersham Biosciences). The purified ScCia1p-DC2 protein was concentrated to 4 mg/ml by Centriprep YM-10 ultrafiltration (Millipore). Microcrystals initially appeared within 2­3 d when a precipitant solution containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5 at 20 C), 35% PEG 8000, and 0.2 M ammonium sulfate was used. Systematic screening of buffer pH, PEGs (4K, 6K and 8K) and different salts did not improve either the crystal size or morphology. Hence, the streak seeding method was employed to improve the growth of these microcrystals. Clusters of thin plate crystals (0.1­ 0.15 mm) appeared in 7­10 d, with 30% PEG 8000, 0.18 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M MES (pH 6.5). Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal on the beam line BL18B, using an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector, at the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. A complete data set was collected at room temperature to a maximum resolution of 2.95 s, and was processed and scaled with the programs DPS/MOSFLM (37) and SCALA from the CCP4 package (38). The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212, with unit-cell parameters a = 106.70, b = 46.92, c = 40.60 s. The data collection statistics are shown in Table 1. An exhaustive screening for heavy-atom derivatives was performed, but none of the derivatives yielded data with

Protein Purification, Crystallization, and X-Ray Data Collection--The expression, purification and crystallization of ScCia1p-DC2 were recently reported (36). Briefly, E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring the pGEX5X-2-ScCia1p-DC2 plasmid was grown at 27 C in TBG-M9 medium (7), containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin and 30 mg/ml chloramphenicol, to an OD650 of 0.8­1.0. GST-ScCia1p-DC2 expression was induced for 3 h by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 0.4 mM. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 500 mM KCl, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF, 20 mg/ml leupeptin and 20 mg/ml pepstatin A, and lysed by EmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin). The cell lysate was centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was applied to GlutathioneSepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences). After washing the resin, GST-ScCia1p-DC2 was eluted and cleaved by

Structural Similarity between Cia1p/Asf1p and NF-kB sufficient quality for MIR structure determination. Since the protein has no methionine residue in its sequence, the protein was mutated to place methionine residues at the positions Val94Met and Leu97Met, and Se-methionines were subsequently incorporated at these positions. The Se-Met incorporated ScCia1p-DC2 protein crystals were obtained in a drop containing 18% PEG4000, 50 mM CaCl2 and 0.1 M Na-Hepes pH 7.5. The cell parameters of these crystals were different from those of the native crystals. In addition, the diffraction from these crystals was very poor, with a limit of not beyond 5.0 s resolution, and was highly anisotropic. During the screening to obtain suitable crystals for the Se-MAD data collection, the structure of the N-terminal conserved domain (comprising residues 1­155) of ScCia1p was solved (39). We used this protein structure (yAsf1N) as a model to solve our ScCia1p-DC2 structure. Structure Determination and Refinement--The structure was determined by molecular replacement with AMoRe (40), using normalized structure factor amplitudes and with the yAsf1N protein structure (39) as the search model. Molecular replacement calculations were carried out with diffraction data in the resolution range of 15­3.0 s. The peaks in the cross-rotation function used for the translation function (TF) search, with subsequent rigid-body refinement, gave a high contrast peak with a correlation coefficient of 31.3 and an R-factor of 50.8%. The model generated from this solution revealed good crystal packing when inspected on a graphics terminal. After rigid body refinement, the structure was subjected to molecular dynamics simulated annealing from 3,000 K to reduce the model phase bias, using the program CNS (41). A test data set containing 5% of the reflections from a data set was selected to examine the Rfree throughout the entire refinement process. Based on the (2 m|Fo|-D|Fc|) and (m|Fo|-D|Fc|) electron-density maps, the structure was rebuilt with the graphics program O (42). The initial value of R-factor and Rfree were 28.9% and 34.6%, respectively, and the (2 m|Fo|-D|Fc|) map generated by CNS, calculated after the 1st cycle of refinement, showed that the model fitted the electron density well and many side chains were readily interpretable (Fig. 1A). Several rounds of simulated annealing with grouped temperature-factors were performed until all possible side chains were identified. A series of omit maps was used for inspection, particularly in the flexible loop regions between b5 and b6, and b7 and b8, and confirmed the amino acid assignment. As the electron density for the side-chain of Lys129 was not visible, it was truncated to Ala during the refinement. At the final stage of refinement, water molecules were added to the peaks above 2.2 s in the (m|Fo|-D|Fc|) difference Fourier map using WATERPICK in CNS, but were only retained in the model that had good spherical electron density and suitable hydrogen bond geometry. The stereochemistry of the refined structure was analyzed with the program PROCHECK (43). The program LSQKAB from CCP4 was used to calculate the r.m.s. deviations for the superposition of the molecules. The figures in this paper were generated by using ESPript (44) and PyMOL (Delano Scientific LLC). Protein Data Bank Entry--The refined atomic coordinates of ScCia1p-DC2 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, under the accession code 1WG3.

Overall Structure of ScCia1p-DC2--The crystal structure of ScCia1p-DC2 was solved by the molecular replacement method and refined to 2.95 s resolution (Fig. 1A). The final structure contains 166 residues, including 6 tagged residues at the N-terminus (tagged residues: 2­7; ScCia1pDC2: 8­167). The region Met8­Asp167 in the structure corresponds to Met1­Asp160, as defined in Swiss-Prot (Entry name: ASF1_YEAST) (Fig. 1B). The actual protein sequence numbering is used for all further discussions. The structure of ScCia1p-DC2 mainly consists of eight antiparallel b-strands, which form a b-sandwich domain topped by short a-helices (Fig. 1, B and C). The topology of ScCia1pDC2 falls into the ``switched'' immunoglobulin class of proteins (45). It possesses two antiparallel b-sheets packed against each other, and a similar Greek key strand topology. The front sheet is formed by antiparallel b-strands (b3, b4, b6, b7, and b9), and the other b-sheet is formed by the other antiparallel b-strands (b1, b2 and b5). A shallow concave groove exists on the front side of the first b-sheet, which possesses a highly hydrophobic surface. In the present ScCia1p-DC2 protein structure, a long chain with an unspecified secondary structure (from Asp154 to Asp160) resides at the C-terminal region. This region is quite flexible and protrudes away from the globular sandwich domain without the bona-fide C-terminal region (Fig. 1, C and D). Since the rest of the C-terminal region is composed of a highly polyanionic stretch, this flexible chain probably separates the two distinct domains (the conserved globular sandwich domain and the polyanionic stretch domain) and enhances their conformational flexibility, which would facilitate binding with other proteins. The electron density for the residues Leu161 to Val169 is completely absent. Since the full length ScCia1p protein was not expressed well, this protein is likely to be degraded with various C-terminal truncations, based on biochemical results and a secondary structure prediction (12). The truncated targets were screened for their expression and purification levels, and the present ScCia1p-DC2 (Met1­Val169) protein yielded good results. Although it produced tiny crystals, we were able to collect a native data set up to 2.95 s resolution. However, we had many difficulties in obtaining heavy-atom derivatives, and none of them gave a good diffraction dataset. After solving this structure by the molecular replacement method, using the recently determined yAsf1N structure (39), we observed an extra, long tail at the C-terminal region (Fig. 1, B and E). This flexible region was probably the main reason for the major hurdles in the various experimental stages, from expression to structure refinement. A comparison of the ScCia1p-DC2 structure (Ile3 to Trp153) with the recently determined yAsf1 structure (39) revealed that the overall structures of these two proteins are almost the same (Fig. 1E). A superposition of the Ca atoms of these two structures (ScCia1p-DC2 : 3­153; yAsf1N: 3­153) yielded an average r.m.s. deviation value of 1.1 s. However, as observed in Fig. 1E, the long loops between b5 and b6 (Asp77­Ser91), and between b7 and b8 (Asp118­His134) did not superpose well, because of their flexibility. Interestingly, insertions and deletions exist in these regions of the S. pombe cia1 sequence (positions 89 and 130­142 in S. pombe cia1) (Fig. 1B) (12), which

suggests that the sequences of these two intervening regions (where loops and short helices are formed) not only diverged throughout evolution but also are loosely structured in ScCia1p. The tertiary structure of the Nterminal domain of hCIA (1­156), determined by NMR, was recently reported (46). Although the overall tertiary structure of ScCia1p-DC2 is similar to that of hCIA, substantial structural variations exist in the loop regions connecting the b-strands b5 and b6, and b7 and b8 (Fig. 1E). The structural deviations occurring in these regions reflect the significant sequence dissimilarity between yeast Cia1p and hCIA (Fig. 1B), and hence may contribute to functional differences between the yeast and human proteins. Surface Potential Analysis--The electrostatic potential analysis revealed that the ScCia1p-DC2 structure possesses a few potential regions for protein­protein

interactions. One is the hydrophobic surface region (concave groove region), which is a protein­protein­interacting region formed by the conserved residues Val45, Val92, Leu96 and Tyr112 (Figs. 1D and 2). Another is the electronegative surface potential arising from the charged residues Asp37, Glu39, Asp58, and Asp77, which are positioned on the b3 and b4 strands (Figs. 1, C and D, and 2). The residues Asp37, Glu39, Asp58, and Asp77 are completely conserved from yeast to human (7, 12). Recent studies have suggested that electronegative surfaces may function as histone-binding determinants (5), and thus it is likely that this conserved region might interact with histones. Another study (46) revealed that the hCIA protein associates with the C-terminal region of histone H3, through the conserved hydrophobic residue Val94, which is located in the hydrophobic concave groove. In addition, the study
J. Biochem.

Structural Similarity between Cia1p/Asf1p and NF-kB showed that the charged residues surrounding the groove, such as Asp54 and Arg108, also contribute to the H3 interaction, though to a lesser extent. Further structural analyses of ScCia1p-containing complexes, such as those with the core histones H3/H4 (19), will be essential to understand not only the functional role of ScCia1p but also the mechanism of the nucleosome assembly processes. Comparison of CIA-I and CIA-II with the ScCia1p-DC2 Structure--Although only one CIA homologue exists in unicellular eukaryotes, multiple genes are present in multicellular organisms, such as CIA (CIA-I) and CIA-II

825 in mammals (28). To understand the structural and functional difference between these family members, we mapped the positions of the divergent amino acids on the ScCia1p-DC2 structure (Fig. 3A). The non-conserved regions, which are mainly clustered in the loop connecting the strands b7 and b8, and on the b-sheet surface (Figs. 1C and 3A), may be responsible for generating the functional differences between these two isoforms. Comparison of Other CIA Homologues with the ScCia1pDC2 Structure--We mapped the evolutionarily conserved residues on the ScCia1p-DC2 structure (Fig. 3B). Many of the conserved residues are distributed on the concave side of the b-sheet. The residues that lie on the interface between the two b-sheets are highly conserved from yeast to human. This conserved region may be responsible for performing the common functional roles of CIA, such as the interaction with H3. However, a closer analysis revealed that the b1 and b5 strands (Figs. 1C and 3B), on the opposite side of the concave groove, possess more non-conserved residues. In addition, the residues residing on the loop connecting the strands b5 and b7 (Figs. 1C and 3B) display more diversity among the species. The residue at position 69 is hydrophobic in the yeast protein (Val69/Ile69) (Fig. 1B), whereas this position is occupied by a basic residue (Arg69) (Fig. 1B) in the human form. Similarly, hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues reside at position 86 in the yeast and human CIA homologues, respectively (Fig. 1B). Another interesting feature of the sequence diversity exists in the loop that connects the strands b7 and b8 (Fig. 1, B and C). The presence of a five-residue insertion, found in S. pombe (Sp), suggests that this region might be responsible for the distinct functional role of the Sp CIA homologue (Spcia1), as compared to those of ScCia1p and hCIA. In addition to this insertion, the sequence of this long loop region is highly divergent from yeast to human. Analyses of the species-specific functions among the S. cerevisiae, S. pombe and human CIA homologues revealed that ScCia1 is dispensable and Spcia1 is indispensable for cell viability, and that ScCia1 could

complement the cell growth defect caused by the deletion of Spcia1, while hCIA could not (11, 12). Hence, we propose that these sites with sequence diversity are likely to be responsible for the functional differences among the various species.

The structure of ScCia1p-DC2 falls into the immunoglobulin-like b-sandwich fold family, which includes various DNAbinding proteins such as NF-kB, involved in the activation of immunoglobulin genes (Fig. 4A), NFAT1, involved in the activation of T cells (Fig. 4B), and p53, involved in tumor suppression and apoptosis (Fig. 4C), although their sequence similarities are low. A maximum sequence identity of about 10% was observed in the DALI results. This is the first time to point out the structural similarities between a histone chaperone and DNA-binding proteins. As expected from the low sequence similarities, the surface potential profiles among these proteins are divergent (Fig. 5, A, B, and C), and they are distinct from that of ScCia1p (Fig. 5D). To gain insight into the functional role of ScCia1p and its relationship with DNA-binding proteins, we carefully analyzed the DALI homology search results. We found that the ScCia1p-DC2 structure is related to

the C-terminal dimerization domain of the p65 subunit of NF-kB (48), with a z-score of 4.2 (Fig. 4A). Superposition of the ScCia1p-DC2 structure with the NF-kB structure yielded an r.m.s. deviation value of 3.4 s, with small gaps for the Ca atoms corresponding to the b-sandwich core region. The NF-kB p50/p65 heterodimer is the classical member of the Rel family. The Rel family transcription factors regulate diverse cellular functions, such as immune response, cell growth, and development. The heterodimer binds to DNA through the edges of the N- and C-terminal domains, which possess the b-sandwich immunoglobulin fold (49). The NFAT1 dimer protein, which also belongs to the Rel family, binds to DNA containing the HIV-1LTR kB site, through the RHR-N and RHR-C subdomains containing the immunoglobulin fold (50). The ScCia1p-DC2 structure is also related to the RHR-C subdomain of NFAT1, with small gaps (z-score = 3.9) (Fig. 4B). Thus, since the bsandwich core region might constitute a potent proteinprotein interaction surface, ScCia1p may form a dimer through this region. This notion is consistent with our finding that the ScCia1p proteins interact with each other in a yeast 2-hybrid assay system (data not shown). In addition to its potential protein­protein interactions, ScCia1p may also interact with DNA through the edges of its b-sandwich domain. However, the DNA-binding mode

Structural Similarity between Cia1p/Asf1p and NF-kB of ScCia1p might be different because an extra region of ScCia1p-DC2 (126­140) (Fig. 1B), as compared to NF-kB and NFAT1, extends from the region responsible for DNAbinding by NF-kB and NFAT1 (shown in a dotted circle in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively). On the other hand, as the b-sandwich fold region of ScCia1p is responsible for its histone chaperone activity, it is plausible that the Rel family proteins (e.g. NF-kB, NFAT1, etc.) might have similar histone chaperone activities. Other DNA-binding proteins with histone chaperone activity may be identified by comparisons to the tertiary structures of other histone chaperones. Another member of the Rel family, p53, forms a tetramer associated with DNA through its first and second subunits (51). Each core domain adopts a b-sandwich fold. Two large loops, at the edge of the b-sandwich, are bound together by a tetrahedrally-coordinated Zn atom. The helix and the loop bind to the major groove of DNA and contact the edges of the base pairs. In contrast to NF-kB and NFAT1, there are large gaps between the ScCia1p-DC2 and the DNA-binding domain of p53 (shown in a dotted circle in Fig. 4C), in spite of the significant fold similarity (z-score = 4.1) (Fig. 4C). p53 has three extra regions (115­ 133, 174­212, and 279­289) as compared to ScCia1p-DC2, and ScCia1p-DC2 contains one extra region (115­132) (Fig. 1B) as compared to p53. Thus, if ScCia1p-DC2

827 binds to DNA, like p53, then it is likely that the DNAbinding by ScCia1p-DC2 and p53 is accomplished in quite different manners, because ScCia1p-DC2 lacks the residues Lys120 and Arg280 of p53, which are important for its DNA-binding activity, and the extra region of ScCia1p-DC2 extends from the area responsible for the DNA-binding by p53. Structural and Functional Relationship between Histone Chaperones and DNA-Binding Proteins--The tertiary structure of the histone chaperone ScCia1p revealed that ScCia1p forms the ``switched'' immunoglobulin class of the b-sandwich fold, which is totally different from the structures of nucleoplasmin family members (52­54). This implies that the nucleosome assembly and/or disassembly reactions involving the histone chaperones are composed of multiple steps, which may utilize different histone chaperones at distinct reaction steps. Surprisingly, we found that ScCia1p shares structural similarity with the DNAbinding domain of the Rel family proteins (Fig. 4). This suggests that a prototypal b-sandwich fold protein previously existed, which interacted with both core histones and naked DNA in ancient organisms (Fig. 6). The histone chaperone CIA, and DNA-binding proteins such as NF-kB, might have evolved from a common prototype to specifically interact with core histones or a particular DNA sequence, respectively (Fig. 6). This hypothesis has been partially confirmed by our recent finding that one of the DNA-binding proteins has histone chaperone activity (unpublished results). Further structural and functional analyses of histone chaperones and the DNA-binding proteins that share structural similarity with them will be required to understand their interaction mechanisms with histones and/or DNA.

Fig. 6. Proposed model for the origin of CIA family proteins from the nucleosome-binding prototype. The NF-kB type protein and ScCia1p, and their putative ancestor (a nucleosomebinding prototype), are depicted as examples of eukaryotic proteins that bind to naked DNA, core histones and/or nucleosomes. The Rel family transcription factors bind to the nucleosomal DNA by interacting through the edges of their b-sandwich immunoglobulin-like folded structures. As the histone chaperone CIA possesses a similar tertiary structure, we propose that histone chaperones and Rel family transcription factors may have evolved from a common prototype during evolution.
