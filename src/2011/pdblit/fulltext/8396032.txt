The structure of the complex of ribonuclease from Streptomyces aureofaciens (RNase Sa) with
ex0 guanosine 2',3'-cyclophosphorothioatehas been refined against 0.2-nm resolution synchrotron

data using, as a starting model, coordinates from the RNase Sa: 2'-GMP complex. The refinement was based on all data over 1.0-0.2 nm and converged to a crystallographic R factor of 11.9%. This is the first structure of a microbial ribonuclease complexed with a 2',3'-cyclophosphorothioate, which is a thio analogue of the intermediate of the two-step reaction. However, ex0 guanosine 2`,3`cyclophosphorothioate is bound in a non-functional mode and is not hydrolysed. This structure therefore does not provide direct evidence on the identity of the amino acid residues responsible for catalytic cleavage of the substrate. However, based on present and previous results, a plausible model is proposed for the complex of the cyclic intermediate which acts as substrate for the second step of the catalysis.

RNase Sa is one of the increasingly numerous members of the microbial ribonuclease family originally described by Hartley (1980) and Hill et al., (1983). The enzyme consists of 96 amino acid residues and its relative molecular mass, determined from the primary sequence is 10054 (Shlyapnikov, et al., 1986). RNase Sa is a highly specific endoribonuclease which hydrolyses the phosphodiester bond of RNA at the 3`-side of guanosine nucleotides (Zelinkova et al., 1971). The structures of native RNase Sa and its complexes with 3'-GMP and 2`-GMP have been reported previously (Sevcik et al., 1991 ; 1993). The structures of the two complexes clearly showed the guanine-specific recognition site, formed by main-chain atoms of residues 38-40 and the carboxylic group of Glu41. The sequences for a number of microbial RNases have been determined. These are either bacterial or fungal. Threedimensional structures are known for a number of bacterial enzymes, including RNase Ba from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (Mauguen et al., 1982), Bi from Bacillus intermedius (Pavlovsky et al., 1983), St from Streptomyces erythreus (Nakamura, et al., 1982) and the present RNase Sa. In addition, several fungal RNase structures are known: RNase TI from Aspergillus oryzae (Heinemann and Saenger, 1982), C, from Aspergillus clavatus (Polyakov et al., 1987) and Pb, from Penicillium brevicompactum (Borisova et al., 1986). The primary structures have been aligned taking the three-dimensional structures into account (Sevcik et al., 1990). The similarity is higher within either the bacterial or fungal groups than between members of the two groups. Only five residues

are totally conserved over all the sequences. In RNase Sa these are Asn39, Glu41, Glu54, Arg69 and His85. The OE atoms of Glu41 H-bonded to the guanosine base. Asn39 appears important in maintaining the conformation around the binding site for the nucleotide. The side chains of Glu54, Arg69 and His85 are proposed as catalytic residues (Hill et al., 1983). The bacterial RNase Sa has similar enzymic properties to the representative fungal RNase T, (Both et al., 1991, Yakovlev et al., 1992) in spite of very low similarity in both sequence and structure, except for the conserved structural motif composed of a three-stranded antiparallel p-pleated sheet and the nucleotide-binding site (Sevcik et al., 1990). There is a difference at the catalytic site of the two enzymes ; RNase Sa has no residue equivalent to RNase TI His40, which appears to be essential for the catalytic activity in RNase T I (Steyaert et al., 1990). The cleavage of substrate by microbial ribonucleases is a two-step reaction; the first step is a transesterification and results in the formation of the intermediate, guanosine 2`,3`cyclophosphate, which is hydrolysed in the second step to yield 3'-guanylic acid (Takahashi, 1970). Guanosine-2`,3'cyclophosphorothioate (2',3'-GCPT) is an analogue of the reaction intermediate, with a sulphur substituting one of the two free phosphate oxygen atoms. There are two isomers of 2',3'-GCPT, endo and ex0 (Fig. 1). The isomers have identical structures except for the phosphate oxygen and sulphur atoms which are interchanged. The endo isomer is hydrolyzed by RNase Sa while the ex0 is not (I. Rybajlak, unpublished results). The same has been observed for RNase T, (L. Wyns and I. Zegers, unpublished results). Direct structural identification of residues involved in cleaving substrate and their role poses a severe problem: if the contacts between the enzyme and a cyclophosphate were functional, the ligand

From the structure of this and previously studied complexes we propose a model for the complex with the endo isomer and hence for the natural complex with the cyclic reaction intermediate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallisation
RNase Sa was isolated from the culture medium of Streptomyces aureofaciens essentially as described earlier (Gasperik et al., 1982). Crystals of RNase Sa were grown by hanging drop vapour diffusion from a 3% protein solution in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, using ammonium sulphate as precipitant (Sevcik et al., 1982). The crystals are in space group P2,2,2, with unit cell dimensions of a = 6.47 nm, b = 7.87 nm, c = 3.91 nm with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, isomorphous with the native and other complex crystals. Endo and ex0 2',3'-GCPT were synthesised as described previously (Eckstein et al., 1972) and a procedure for their separation developed (A. F. Haikal, unpublished results). The complex was prepared by diffusion of exo-2',3'-GCPT into RNase Sa crystals in mother liquor. The concentration of 2',3'-GCPT was about 1.6 mg/ml. Crystals were soaked for three days before mounting in capillaries. Data were collected 6 days later from a single crystal of size approximately 0.5 X 0.5 X 0.4 mm'.

Data collection and processing
Data to 0.2-nm resolution were collected on the EMBL X11 beam line at the DORIS storage ring, DESY, Hamburg, equipped with an imaging plate scanner. 92" of data were covered by 23 images with 2" rotation followed by 46 images with 1" rotation. The crystal axes were sufficiently offset from the rotation axis to minimize the number of non-measurable reflections in the blind region. A summary of data collection is given in Table 1. The characteristics of the data are very similar to those for RNase Sa complexes with 3'GMP and 2'-GMP and are not presented in detail. Statistics of the data as a function of resolution are shown in Table S1.

Refinement
Refinement was carried out by restrained least-squares minimisation (Konnert & Hendrickson, 1980; Baker & Dodson, 1980). No sigma cutoff was applied to the amplitudes. Rebuilding of the model after each refinement step was carried out on an Evans and Sutherland PS300 graphics station

using the program FRODO (Jones, 1978). As a starting model, coordinates of two molecules, referred to as A and B, in the asymmetric unit of the structure of the 2'-GMP complex were used. Only about 75% of the water molecules (290) with low B values were included. No ligand atoms were included in the first stages of refinement. The initial R factor was 24%. After a few cycles, the electron density for 2',3'-GCPT at the active site of molecule A became very clear while that at molecule B was weaker. Both 2',3'-GCPT molecules were built into the model with occupancy for all the atoms in molecule B set to 0.5. An occupancy of 0.5 was also given to side-chain atoms of the disordered residues Asp1 A, Asp25A, Asp25B, Gln38B, Arg40B and Gln77B, for which the electron density was poor. Two positions were modelled for Ser31A OG and for Cys72A and B SG; the occupancies were estimated from the respective electron densities. Close to Arg63A a sulphate ion was modelled. New water molecules were assigned by an automatic water-search program (V. Lamzin, unpublished results). Their densities were checked after each cycle and those with densities lower

than 300 ehm' were rejected. Table S2 summarizes the stereochemical restraints which were applied to the parameter5 of the final model together with the final deviations. Thermal parameters are given in Table S3. The refinement was accomplished in six steps of five cycles each; yielding a final R factor of 11.9%. The model contains 745 protein atoms and 23 2',3'-GCPT atoms for each enzyme molecule, as well as 1 sulphate ion and 466 water molecules.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
There are no major differences in the protein itself between the present structure and those previously reported; native RNase Sa and its complexes with 3'-GMP and 2'GMP. The fold of the protein is therefore not further discussed. The (2F,-F,) electron density for ex0 2',3'-GCPT at the active site of molecule A is shown in Fig. 2. 2',3'-GCPT

binds in the same manner but at lower occupancy to molecule B. Therefore, the rest of the discussion is restricted to molecule A. Interactions between 2',3'-GCPT and enzyme are given in Table 2. Stereo views of 2',3'-GCPT and associated amino acid residues superimposed on the 2`-GMP and 3'-GMP complexes are shown in Fig. 3 a and b, respectively. Superposition was carried out by least-squares minimisation for all pairs of CA atoms. The base lies in essentially the same position as for 2'-GMP and 3'-GMP and forms an identical network of hydrogen bonds with the enzyme in all three complexes. The ribose and cyclophosphate form an essentially rigid moiety. The conformation of the ribose relative to the base in the exo 2',3'-GCPT complex is similar to that for 3'-GMP and quite different from that for 2'-GMP. The free phosphate oxygen forms hydrogen bonds with Arg69 NE and NH1 as in the 3'-GMP complex. The sulphur atom could not form such contacts and thus these bonds determine the orientation of the cyclophosphate, and hence the ribose, in the complex. The sulphur atom points away from the enzyme interior and the closest contact with the enzyme is His85 NE2 at a distance of 0.32 nm. The distances between the 2',3'-GCPT 02' and 03' and the catalytic atoms of Glu54 and His85, respectively, are too long for hydrogen bonds. Indeed, these atoms are placed such that 02' points to His85 and 03' to Glu54 in conflict with the accepted mechanism (Takahashi, 1970). This explains why the ligand is not cleaved. The configuration of the S and 0 atoms in the phosphate of the ex0 isomer forces it to adopt this non-functional conformation. Thus, the ex0 2',3'-GCPT complex does not provide direct experimental identification of the residues responsible for catalytic cleavage of the substrate. However, on the basis of the three known complex structures (ex0 2',3'-GCPT, 2'-GMP and 3'-GMP), we can develop a plausible model for the productive intermediate, guanosine 2',3'-cyclophosphate or its endo thio analogue. Endo 2',3'-GCPT is cleaved by RNase Sa and thus the contacts formed in its complex with enzyme must be productive, in contrast to those of the ex0 isomer. The configuration of the S and 0 atoms is inverted in the endo isomer relative to the exo. Building of the model for the endo isomer was based on the following. (a) The position of the base is very similar in the three complexes and results from the specificity of the enzyme. We started by assuming a position for the base as in the 3`GMP complex, the true reaction product. (b) The two rigid parts of the nucleotides, the base and ribophosphate, can rotate relative to one another around the N9-C1' bond, as is seen in their different mutual orientations in the complexes. (c) It was supposed that two factors determine the orientation of the ribophosphorothioate. These are firstly the bonds between the phosphate oxygen and the residues to which it is bound and, secondly, the relatively large S atom, which is unable to form such bonds, points away from the protein. (d) The conserved residues Glu54, Arg69 and His85 should be involved in catalysis. Rotation of the ribophosphate of the endo isomer around the N9-C1' bond by about 120"relative to its position in the ex0 isomer satisfies these requirements. There are H bonds between the phosphate oxygen and the N atoms of either or both of the active-site arginines, Arg69 or Arg65. Which particular H bonds are formed is critically dependent on the exact conformation chosen for the 2',3'-GCPT and of the arginine side chains which are likely to be somewhat flexible. The ribose moiety occupies a position close to that found in the 2'-GMP complex with the C5' atom pointing away from the active site as expected for the real substrate. The sulphur atom points away from the enzyme and makes no contacts with it. Slight adjustment of the Glu54 side chain allows its OD1 to form a hydrogen bond with the ribose 02'. In the second step of the catalytic cleavage of substrate, the cyclophosphate is hydrolysed. In this process a water molecule carries out nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom. In the model, the distance between His85 NH2 and the P atom, about 0.6 nm, is long enough to be bridged by such a water molecule. In addition, there is a water molecule close to this position in the structure of native RNase Sa. The proposed model for the binding of endo 2',3'-GCPT, or indeed the real intermediate, is shown in Fig. 4. This work was partly financed by Slovak Academy of Sciences grant no. 2/999138/92.
