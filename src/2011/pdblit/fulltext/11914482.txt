Double-mutant cycles are widely used in the Æeld of protein engineering to measure intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. Ideally, there should be no structural rearrangement of the protein on making the two single mutations and the double mutation within the cycle. However, structural pertubation on mutation does not preclude the use of this method, providing the sum of the changes in the single mutants equals the change in the double mutant. In this way, the energy associated with any structural rearrangement cancels in the double-mutant cycle. Previously, the contribution of a buried salt bridge between Arg69 and Asp93 in barnase to the stability of the folded protein has been determined by double-mutant cycle analysis. In order to determine whether the measured interaction of ¿14.0 kJ mol¿1 represents the true interaction energy, the crystal structure of each mutant within the double-mutant cycle was solved. Although mutation results in structural shifts, the majority of those in the single mutants are also found in the double mutant; their energetic effects in the double-mutant cycle are therefore cancelled. This study highlights the robust nature of the double-mutant cycle analysis.

1. Introduction
The experimentally determined contribution of salt bridges to the stability of proteins is highly context dependent. Engineered and wild-type salt bridges on the surface of barnase, T4 lysosyme and CI-2 (Dao-Pin et al., 1991; de Prat Gay et al., 1994; Horovitz et al., 1990; Sali et al., 1991; Serrano et al., 1990) contribute between 0.4 and 2.1 kJ mol¿1 to the overall stability of the protein. Formation of networks of salt bridges, however, can increase the contribution of each individual salt bridge to the stability of the protein by energetic coupling of the structurally linked salt bridges (Horovitz et al., 1990; Marqusee & Sauer, 1994). Buried salt bridges in chymotrypsin and T4 lysosyme have been observed to contribute between 12.5 and 20.1 kJ mol¿1 to stability relative to a state in which one partner is mutated leaving a charged unpaired residue (Anderson et al., 1990; Fersht, 1972). Several recent studies have shown that buried salt bridges are destabilizing relative to their hydrophobic counterparts owing to the large and unfavourable energy required to desolvate charges (Hendsch & Tidor, 1994; Waldburger et al., 1995; Wimley et al., 1996). The role of salt bridges in determining the rate and pathway of folding and unfolding has been investigated for several proteins (Cavagnero et al., 1998; Waldburger et al., 1995, 1996). Salt bridges have also been shown to be important for the speciÆcity of a fold. This has been demonstated conclusively for -helical coiled coils in both designed de novo peptides and

basic leucine zippers from transcription factors such as GCN4, the Fos and Jun proteins and members of the C/EBP and ATF/ CREB families (Monera et al., 1994; O'Shea et al., 1992; Schneider et al., 1997; Vinson et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 1994b). Tissot et al. (1996) have determined the contribution of a buried salt bridge to the stability and folding of barnase, a small extracellular endonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (Mr = 12 382). This salt bridge is between Arg69, in loop3 and Asp93 in -turn3±4 linking the third and fourth -strands (Fig. 1). Using a 9-value analysis (Fersht et al., 1992; Horovitz, 1992) the salt bridge was determined to be almost fully formed in the transition state of the folding pathway. This interaction is therefore formed early in the folding process. These results were conÆrmed in a study examining the effect of pH on the folding rate of the mutant Asp933Asn compared with the wild type (Oliveberg & Fersht, 1996). Further, this study showed that disrupting the Arg69±Asp93 salt bridge in this way alters the folding pathway of the protein. The strength of the salt bridge in the fully folded protein was also measured using double-mutant cycle analysis and calculated to be worth 14.0 kJ mol¿1 (Table 1). Double-mutant cycles can be used to determine the interaction of two residues X and Y in a folded protein E-XY relative to their interaction in the unfolded state (Carter et al., 1984; Horovitz, 1987; Horovitz & Fersht, 1990; Serrano et al., 1990). The interaction energy ¡¡Gint is deÆned as ¡¡Gint  ¡¡GE-XY3E-X ¿ ¡¡GE-Y3E Y 1

in which X has been mutated and E, the double mutant in which both X and Y are mutated. A thermodynamic cycle is set up between the wild type, each of the single mutants and the double mutant. The difference in the energy of parallel sides of the cycle is ¡¡Gint. ¡¡Gint is an estimate of the interaction between the two residues involved in the ideal situation where there is no structural rearrangement on mutating X and Y or if the energies associated with any resulting structural changes cancel in the thermodynamic cycle. This has been described in detail previously (Fersht et al., 1992; Serrano et al., 1990). In order to determine whether the interaction energy measured by Tissot et al. (1996) for the buried salt bridge between Arg69 and Asp93 in barnase is a true estimate of the strength of the interaction, we have crystallized and solved the structure of the wild type and each mutant in the doublemutant cycle by X-ray diffraction. These are Arg693Ser (mutant RS69), Asp933Asn (mutant DN93) and the double mutant combining the two (mutant RS69:DN93). The extent of destabilization of these mutants relative to the wild type is listed in Table 1. We show that in the case of this buried salt bridge the majority of the new interactions made in the single mutants are also made in the double mutant. The energetic terms associated with these changes cancel in the double-mutant cycle. The estimate of the interaction energy for this salt bridge (Tissot et al., 1996) is therefore reasonable.

Wild-type barnase and the three salt-bridge mutants Arg693Ser (RS69), Asp933Asn (DN93), Arg693Ser: Asp933Asn (RS69:DN93) were expressed and puriÆed as previously described (Tissot et al., 1996). PuriÆed protein was dialysed into water, concentrated to 10±15 mg ml¿1 and stored in aliquots at 203 K. All barnase salt-bridge mutants were crystallized under the same conditions as the wild type. Crystals were grown using the hanging-drop method (McPherson, 1982) at 288 or 285 K. A 5 ml drop containing 8±12 mg ml¿1 protein, 6 mM ZnSO4, 0.1 M (NH4)2SO4 (Ænal concentrations) was suspended over a 1 ml well. The well conditions were 2.58±2.73 M ammonium

Normally crystals grew within two weeks of set-up; however, crystals of RS69 grew in a drop which was six months old. Initially, crystalline precipitate was observed in this drop. Dissolution of this precipitate by suspending the drop over a well containing 1.89 M ammonium phosphate buffer pH 6.1 was followed by re-equilibration of the drop over the original well solution. Streak-seeding of this `re-used' drop induced crystallization for this mutant. Wildtype and mutant crystals grew isomorphously as hexagonal rods of average size 75 ¬ 75 ¬ 250 mm.

Data were collected in-house, using Cu K radiation from an Elliot GX13 rotating anode, on a MAR Research image plate. The salt-bridge mutant RS69 was the exception; data for this mutant were collected at Daresbury synchrotron. Data sets were indexed and the reØection intensities measured using MOSFLM (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The CCP4 suite was used for data reduction (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). 5% of the data set for each mutant was Øagged for calculation of » the free R factor (Brunger, 1992a, 1993) during reÆnement. The same reØections were Øagged for all structures to minimize coupling of reØections between calculated and observed » structure factors (Kleywegt & Brunger, 1996).

The crystals belong to space group P32, with three molecules per asymmetric unit.

Cycles of maximum-likelihood reÆnement using REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) and model building in O (Jones et al., 1991) were used to further improve the model. NCS restraints were used for all structures. During reÆnement, at least one round of » simulated annealing in X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992b) was included in the early stages and the geometry of the model was checked regularly using OOPS (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994a) and PROCHECK (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The reÆnement was considered complete when the free R factor could be reduced no further. Structural comparisons of mutants with the wild type were based on a least-squares Æt of C atoms of the two structures. LSQMAN (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994b) was used for this purpose. Hydrogen-bond lengths and angles were calculated using CONTACT (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994).

Cameron, 1992; Mauguen et al., 1982). Existing crystal structures were solved from data collected at 277 K. Data for the mutants of the Arg69±Asp93 salt bridge were collected from cryocooled crystals at 100 K; therefore, to eliminate differences owing to the temperature of data collection, the structure of the wild-type protein was also determined from data collected at 100 K.

3. Results
The structure of wild-type barnase is known from both crystallographic and solution studies (Bycroft et al., 1991;
Acta Cryst. (2002). D58, 591±600

Arg69 is situated in loop3 in barnase and Asp93 is in -turn3±4 between the third and fourth -strands (Fig. 1). Loop3 is the longest loop, spanning 14 residues from Phe56, whose side chain is in the long cleft forming the active site, to Arg69. It is naturally divided into two sub-loops by Leu63, the side chain of which is anchored in hydrophobic core3. The Ærst seven residues of loop3, 56±62, form the guanosine-binding loop; during RNAse activity, a characteristic set of hydrogen bonds to guanosine give barnase G-base speciÆcity (Buckle & Fersht, 1994; Guillet et al., 1993). The remaining residues, 64±69, are referred to here as loop3b. The side chain of Arg69 Ælls the centre of loop3b, packing against the main chain of Gly65 and Lys66 (Fig. 2). -turn3±4, a type I -turn, comprises a hydrogen bond between Ser91 O, the C-terminus of the 3-strand, and Trp94 N, the N-terminal residue of the 4-strand. The salt bridge comprises hydrogen bonds between Arg69 NE and Asp93 OD1, both of which are completely buried from solvent, and between Arg69 NH2 and Asp93 OD2, with a combined solvent-accessible surface area   (ASA) of 28.0 A2. The side chains of Arg69 and Asp93 are close to the favoured rotamer conformations (Ponder &

Richards, 1987), apart from the torsion angles deÆning the orientation of the guanidinium group and the carboxylate group: 14 and 12 are 155 and ¿17 , respectively, and the guanidinium group and the carboxylate group form a slightly twisted plane. This side-on geometry is typical of an intramolecular arginine±aspartate interaction (Mitchell et al., 1992). The salt-bridge partners make several additional interactions. These hydrogen bonds, as well as other interactions made between loop3b and -turn3±4, are illustrated in Fig. 2.
3.2. Inherent flexibility of loop3 in wild-type barnase

There are three protein chains in the asymmetric unit of wild-type barnase: A, B and C. A least-squares Æt of C atoms of each chain to every other gives a mean r.m.s. deviation of   0.4 A. Loop3b has a higher than average deviation (Fig. 3a). The electron density for loop3 in the A and B chains is poor compared with the rest of the chain: in the A chain density contoured at 1' [' is the r.m.s. deviation in (2Fo ¿ Fc) density] is weak along the backbone of Arg59 and Gly68 and several side chains have no density beyond C; in the B chain density for these residues is continuous only when contoured at 0.6'. By contrast, the C chain has well deÆned density for both the main chain and side chains in loop3 (Fig. 3b). The mean temperature factor per residue for loop3 in the A and B chains is signiÆcantly higher than the overall mean value (Fig. 3c). Once again, the C chain is the exception, with temperature factors close to the mean for the chain. A comparison of the crystal contacts made by each chain reveals that loop3b in the

and 20 such contacts, with mean contact distances of 4.1 and   3.9 A, respectively. Considering loop3 as a whole (including the GR loop), the C chain makes a total of 92 contacts of less   than 4.5 A, compared with only 17 and 28 for the A and B chains. Considered together, the least-squares Æt of NCS-related molecules, the electron density and the temperature factors suggest that loop3 is inherently Øexible. Deviations from the wild-type position of this loop have been observed elsewhere (Baudet & Janin, 1991; Buckle & Fersht, 1994; Guillet et al., 1993). Loop3b in the C chain does not exhibit similarly high deviations in temperature factors and electron density because of the restrictions imposed by crystal packing. All structural comparisons are carried out for the C chain of barnase.

A control is needed in order to distinguish differences arising from the inherent Øexibility of loop3b from those arising from mutation. This is provided by considering the variation in position of loop3b in several independently solved structures of wild-type barnase. Three wild-type structures at 277 K have been solved from crystals grown at pH 6.0 (PDB code 1bni; Cameron, 1992), pH 7.5 (A. M. Buckle, personal communication) and pH 9.0 (PDB code 1bnj; Cameron, 1992); these are subsequently referred to by the pH at which the crystal was grown. A fourth structure was solved in this study using data collected at 100 K from crystals grown at pH 7.5 (see x2). This is abbreviated to wt herein, since it is the reference wild-type structure for the salt-bridge mutants. Table 3 lists the results of a least-squares Æt of the C chains of each wild-type structure to every other. The superposition of structures at pH 6.0 and pH 9.0 has the smallest deviation, closely followed by the Æt of the pH 7.5 structure with wt (both at the same pH but with different temperature of data collection).

frozen and unfrozen structures or the structure at pH 7.5 with other pH values, all have larger r.m.s. deviations and larger maximum deviations in loop3b. In the equivalent Æts for the A and B chains, the maximum deviation of loop3b is considerably   larger (the majority are greater than 1 A; data not shown), further emphasizing the restricted Øexibility of loop3b in the C chain. In this study, the pH of crystal growth and the temperature of data collection is the same for the wild-type and salt-bridge mutants which have been solved. The inherent deviation of loop3b is therefore unlikely to be greater than that observed for structures at the same pH but different   temperature (0.4 A).

The deviation of C atoms for each residue in the Æt of wild   type and DN93 is shown in Fig. 4. The r.m.s. deviation is 0.2 A for C atoms; for residues 64±70 and 91±95 only, this value is   0.5 and 0.3 A, respectively (Table 4). The deviation observed  for all C atoms is low compared with those amongst different wild-type structures. Overall, this mutant resembles the wild type. There is an outward shift of Ser67±Arg69 to a maximum   of 0.9 A away from the side chain of Asn93 (Fig. 5a). Despite this backbone movement, the side chain of Arg69, in particular the guanidinium group, remains in approximately the same position as in the wild type. In -turn3±4, there is a   backbone shift of up to 0.5 A for Asn93 and Trp94 away from

loop3b. This conservative mutation does not create a cavity, as predicted (Tissot et al., 1996). The amide group of the mutated Asn93 changes orientation relative to the wild type. 12 changes to 137 ; steric hindrance from Ser91 OG prevents a more favourable angle being occupied. This new 1 angle increases the solvent accessibility     of this side chain to 55 A2, compared with 46 A2 in the wild type. The relative orientation of the OD1 and ND2 atoms of the amide group of Asn93 in this mutant is unclear from the electron density and the temperature factors. It seems likely, however, that the shortest interaction between the guanidinium group and the amide group is between atoms of opposite polarity. In this case, Asn93 OD1 is solvent accessible and forms a charge± polar hydrogen bond with Arg69 NH2; Asn93 ND2 is inaccessible to solvent, pointing towards the centre of the loop (Fig. 6a). In this orientation, the singlemutant atoms Asn93 OD1 and Asn93 ND2 are structurally equivalent to wild-type Asp93 OD2 and Asp93 OD1, respectively. The separation of the interacting arginine and Asn93 has increased by more than   0.5 A relative to the wild type. Although the separation of Asn93 OD1 and Arg69 NH2 is the shortest distance between the two residues, it is still relatively long for a strong hydrogen bond. Asn93 ND2 makes a single hydrogen bond with the only new water molecule, Wat147, observed in this mutant (Fig. 6a). No new hydrogen bonds between loop3b and -turn3±4 are formed and all other interactions made in the wild type are made in this single mutant. There is no signiÆcant increase in the mean temperature factors per residue of loop3b relative to the mean value for the whole chain and in this respect DN93 also resembles the wild-type protein. This suggests that the salt bridge alone is not responsible for maintaining the mean temperature factors of this loop. As well as the changes in main-chain position around the site of mutation, residues 32±33 at the C-terminus of the 2 helix   show shifts greater than 0.5 A in the Æt of this mutant to the wild type (Fig. 4). These changes are a result of crystal packing, however, since they make contacts with loop3b and are observed in all three mutants of the double-mutant cycle.

    0.4 A and that for residues 91±95 is 0.2 A (Table 4). The  overall deviation of C atoms is the same for DN93; however, DN93 has larger deviations in loop3b and -turn3±4. Residues Gly65 and Lys66 collapse to a small extent into the cavity created by the mutation of the Arg69 side chain (Fig. 5b). Ser67±Ser69 shifts in the opposite direction, away from the wild-type position and the rest of the protein, by a   maximum of 0.7 A. The main chain from Ser91 to Leu95 changes little compared with the wild type. All side chains in loop3b and -turn3±4 remain in the same conformation as in the wild type, except for the salt-bridge partners Ser69 and Asp93. The electron density clearly deÆnes two possible conformations for the side chain of Ser69. The A rotamer maintains approximately the same 11 angle as the wild-type Arg69; this is close to one of the preferred rotamers of the serine side chain (Ponder & Richards, 1987). In this rotamer the hydroxyl group lies in the plane of the loop, whereas in the B rotamer the side chain points out of the loop. On deletion of the guanidinium group of Arg69, the side chain of Asp93 changes conformation (11 and 12 are ¿59 and 121 , respectively; Fig. 5a). In its new conformation, Asp93 OD1 forms a hydrogen bond with each rotamer of the mutated disordered Ser69 OG, which together count as a whole. The direct hydrogen bond with Ser91 OG made in the wild type is lost and is replaced by a water-mediated hydrogen bond in this mutant. In addition to the new interaction with the carboxylate group of Asp93, each rotamer of the Ser69 side chain makes a new hydrogen bond with Ser92 OG, which together can be considered as a whole. Four new water molecules enter the cavity created at the centre of the loop by the mutation of the arginine group and the change in the conformation of the aspartate side chain. These are Wat78, Wat429, Wat454 and Wat254. Wat78 and Wat429 occupy the space equivalent to the arginine side chain in the wild type. Wat454 sits in front and Wat254 behind this. A

network of hydrogen bonds are made by these water molecules (Fig. 6b). The remaining interactions made by loop3b and -turn3±4 in the wild type are made in this single mutant. Two waters which hydrogen bond to the guanidinium group of Arg69 in the wild type have no equivalent in this mutant. These are Wat257 and Wat323, which form hydrogen bonds with Arg69 NH1 and NH2, respectively (the latter is long for a hydrogen bond). Temperature factors for loop3b in RS69 increase signiÆcantly relative to the mean overall temperature factor for the C chain. This suggests that the interactions made by Arg69 in the wild type are important for reducing the Øexibility of loop3b.

resembles the single mutant RS69. The loop is therefore considerably more Øexible than in the wild type.
3.7. Structural rationalization of stability changes

The Æt of the C chain of this double mutant to the wild type   has an r.m.s. deviation of C atoms of 0.2 A (Table 4). For   residues 64±70 and 91±95, the r.m.s. deviation is 0.6 and 0.3 A, respectively, which is a higher deviation than for either of the single mutants. There is a collapse of the backbone at Lys66 of   up to 0.49 A into the site of the Ser69 mutation. By contrast, Gly68 and Ser69 shift away from the wild-type position by up   to 0.9 A. Around the site of the Asn93 mutation no shift is observed for the main chain of residues 91±93; however, the backbone of Trp94 and Leu95 moves away from loop3b by a   maximum of 0.5 A. The side chain of Ser69 in the double mutant has approximately the same 11 angle as the wild-type arginine; the side chain therefore lies in the plane of the loop (Fig. 5c). The mutated side chain of Asn93 stays in roughly the same position as in the wild type; however, the side-chain dihedral angles become unfavourable (11 and 12 of 16 and 120 , respectively). The strained conformation allows both OD1 and ND2 of Asn93 to form hydrogen bonds. Asn93 ND2 points into loop3b, where it forms one hydrogen bond with Ser69 OG (Fig. 6c). This interaction is equivalent to that made between Ser69 OG and Asp93 OD1 in the single mutant RS69. Asn93 OD1 maintains the interaction with Ser91 OG found in the wild type. In addition to its interaction with Asn93, Ser69 OG forms a hydrogen bond with Ser92 OG. This hydrogen bond is also made in the single mutant RS69. Four new water molecules, Wat136, Wat325, Wat326 and Wat333, enter the created cavity, with Wat136 and Wat326 occupying the space of the truncated arginine and Wat325 and Wat333 in front of and behind this, repectively. They form a network of hydrogen bonds within the created cavity (Fig. 6c). Three of the four new waters observed have a direct equivalent in the single mutant RS69: Wat325 is equivalent to Wat454 in the single mutant, and Wat326 and Wat333 to Wat429 and Wat254, respectively. The wild-type water molecule Wat323, which hydrogen bonds to Arg69 NH2, has no equivalent in this double mutant. It is also missing from the single mutant RS69. The average temperature factor per residue increases dramatically for loop3b in the double mutant relative to the mean of all residues. This distribution of temperature factors

All mutations in this double-mutant cycle result in only minor local rearrangement despite each mutant being considerably destabilized relative to the wild type (Table 1). The mutant with greatest destabilization, DN93, most resembles the wild type in structure. In DN93, two of the three amino groups in the unpaired side chain of Arg69, NH1 and NH2, make charge±polar hydrogen bonds. A possible explanation for the large destabilization of this mutant is that the third amino group, NE, which is buried within loop3b, makes no interactions. The importance of fulÆlling hydrogen-bonding potential has been noted previously in T4 lyosyme (Alber et al., 1987). These results contrast with the structural consequences of disrupting a buried arginine±asparate salt bridge in chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (Gibbs et al., 1990). In this protein, mutating the asparate to asparagine results in both partners of the salt-bridge changing conformation entirely, as well as other local side-chain rearrangements and backbone   movements up to 20 A from the site of mutation; all polar and charged groups of the mutated salt bridge form hydrogen bonds in their new orientations. Interestingly, this mutant has the same stability as the wild-type protein. The least destabilized salt-bridge mutant RS69 replaces arginine, a hydrogen-bond donor, with serine, which can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds. In the single mutant, the hydroxyl group of the mutant Ser69 donates a hydrogen bond to the remaining salt-bridge partner Asp93 and accepts a hydrogen bond from the hydroxyl group of Ser92 in -turn3±4. The structures of this mutant and the double mutant resemble one another, but the double mutant is 3.2 kJ mol¿1 less stable. In RS69:DN93, Ser69 forms an equivalent hydrogen bond with residue 93, although in this case the hydroxyl group accepts a H atom from Asn ND2. This hydrogen bond is a polar±polar interaction compared with the charge±polar interaction of the single mutant RS69. Deleting a charged hydrogen-bonding group at an enzyme±substrate interface decreases the binding energy by more than twice that of a polar±polar interaction (Fersht et al., 1985). This may be the primary source of the destabilization of the double mutant relative to RS69. In addition, the side chain of Asn93 in the double mutant has considerably fewer favourable torsion angles than its equivalent in RS69 and, unlike RS69, there is no water-mediated interaction between Asp93 and Pro64. In both RS69 and the double mutant the cavity created by the truncation of the arginine side chain is Ælled by four water molecules. A similar mutation at a dimer±dimer interface of gene V protein (GVP) from Ff phage, Arg823Cys, results in the collapse of a neighbouring side chain into the site of mutation; no water is observed in the created cavity (Su et al., 1997). It has been suggested that the Arg69±Asp93 salt bridge contributes to the folding of barnase by limiting the number of conformations available (Oliveberg & Fersht, 1996; Tissot et al., 1996), since buried but unpaired charges are highly

destabilizing. Consequently, Arg69 has been proposed as an example of a `structural' arginine (Borders et al., 1994; Mrabet et al., 1992; Tissot et al., 1996). Examining the temperature factors for loop3b in the wild type and each of the mutants clearly illustrates that it is primarily the arginine side chain and not the salt bridge which is responsible for maintaining native-like Øexibility of this loop, thus further supporting the original observation (Tissot et al., 1996).
3.8. The double-mutant cycle in relation to the single- and double-mutant structures

For the interaction between X and Y in a protein E-XY, a thermodynamic cycle is contructed consisting of the wild type, E-XY, two single mutants in which X and Y are mutated to A and B, respectively, and the double mutant in which both X and Y are simultaneously mutated to A and B. The difference between parallel sides of this cycle is the interaction energy, ¡¡Gint, ¡¡Gint  ¡¡GE-XY3E-XB  ¡¡GE-AY3E-AB  ¡¡GE-XY3E-AY  ¡¡GE-XB3E-AB X 2

Ideally, there are no changes in structure on mutation of E or any structural changes in the single mutant are also present in the double mutant and the energy associated with these changes will cancel in the cycle. ¡¡Gint then reduces to the interaction energy plus the change in solvation of X and Y on mutating their partner (Fersht et al., 1992; Serrano et al., 1990). From an analysis of each structure within the cycle constructed for the Arg69±Asp93 salt bridge, it is clear that all direct hydrogen bonds formed between residues in loop3b and -turn3±4 cancel. The exception is the interaction between Asp93 and Ser91. The direct hydrogen bond made between these residues in the wild type is lost in the single mutant DN93; however, it is replaced by a water-mediated interaction, so it is compensated for to some extent. Changes in solvation parallel the changes in structure in that DN93 resembles the wild type and RS69 resembles the double mutant. The formation of a new hydrogen bond with a water molecule at the surface of a protein is an isoenthalpic process (Fersht et al., 1985), since in bulk solvent the water will hydrogen bond with another water. There is, however, an entropy cost in localizing the water molecule at the protein surface. This has been estimated to be worth 8.4 kJ mol¿1 per water (Dunitz, 1994). Considering only water molecules which make hydrogen bonds with the salt-bridge residues and those which enter the site of mutation, a net of zero water molecules are localized within the cycle. Analysis of the structural changes in this double-mutant cycle therefore reduces to the set of interactions formed between residues 69 and 93 in each structure. In the single mutant RS69 and the double mutant RS69:DN93 there is one hydrogen bond, between the hydroxyl group of Ser69 and side chain of Asp93 and Asn93, respectively. These interactions therefore cancel, leaving the Arg69±Asp93 interaction in the wild type and the Arg69±Asn93 interaction in the single mutant DN93. In the wild type this comprises two hydrogen

bonds plus the electrostatic component. In DN93 this is a single charge±polar hydrogen bond. Consequently, the measured interaction energy of ¿14.0 ∆ 0.62 kJ mol¿1 (Table 1) is the sum of the electrostatic component of the Arg69±Asp93 interaction plus a single hydrogen bond. The strength of a hydrogen bond varies widely depending upon the context of the interaction. Deletion of largely buried hydrogen bonds in barnase and T4 lysosyme destabilize the protein by $2.1±8.4 kJ mol¿1 (Alber et al., 1987; Chen et al., 1993; Serrano et al., 1992). Deletion of uncharged hydrogenbonding groups involved in substrate binding reduces the binding free energy to tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase by 2.1± 6.3 kJ mol¿1, whereas deletion of a charged group reduces the binding free energy by 12.5±18.8 kJ mol¿1 (Fersht et al., 1985). It is difÆcult, therefore, to estimate precisely the strength of the electrostatic interaction; however, it could potentially have a maximum value near 12.5 kJ mol¿1. Elsewhere, the contribution of buried salt bridges to protein stability has been estimated by measuring the change in pKa on titration of a one partner in the salt bridge (Anderson et al., 1990; Fersht, 1972), by desolvation experiments on de novo designed peptides (Wimley et al., 1996) and by substitution of the charged residues by hydrophobic residues (Hendsch & Tidor, 1994; Waldburger et al., 1995). Interaction energies measured from the double-mutant cycle are fundamentally different from the energies estimated from these methods. The double-mutant cycle analysis (Carter et al., 1984; Horovitz, 1987; Horovitz & Fersht, 1990; Serrano et al., 1990) of the electrostatic interaction between residues in a salt bridge gives an estimate of their true interaction energy in the ideal situation where there is no structural rearrangement on mutation to the single and double mutants in the cycle (Fersht et al., 1992; Serrano et al., 1990). It is a measure of the strength of the electrostatic interaction in the folded relative to the unfolded state, where in a random coil conformation they are presumed to interact only with solvent and not with each other. Since double-mutant cycles were Ærst used to measure the cooperative effects of residues within the active site of tyrosyl tRNA synthetase on binding of ATP (Carter et al., 1984), the method has been incorporated as an additional tool within the Æeld of protein engineering (Horovitz & Fersht, 1990; Wells, 1990), measuring the strength of speciÆc interactions between proteins (Ackermann et al., 1998; Goldman et al., 1997; Schreiber & Fersht, 1995), within proteins (de Vos et al., 1992; Horovitz et al., 1990; Jackson & Fersht, 1994; Licata & Ackers, 1995; Loewenthal et al., 1992; Marqusee & Sauer, 1994; Sali et al., 1991; Serrano et al., 1990, 1991) and designed helical peptides (Krylov et al., 1994; Zhou et al., 1994a) and during the folding process (Horovitz, 1992; Horovitz et al., 1991; Itzhaki et al., 1995). In many of these examples the energetic analysis is accompanied by structural studies, notably using NMR techniques, conÆrming that the mutations do not lead to signiÆcant structural changes. This study underlines the importance of structural information in interpreting interaction energies measured using this method and highlights the robust nature of the double-mutant cycle analysis.
