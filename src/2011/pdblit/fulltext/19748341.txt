Abstract A novel copper-containing enzyme named COI (catechol oxidase I) has been isolated and purified from tobacco by extracting acetoneemerged powder with phosphate buffer, centrifugation at low temperature, ammonium sulfate fractional precipitation, and column chromatography on DEAE-sephadex (A-50), sephadex (G-75), and DEAE-celluse (DE-52). PAGE, SDS-PAGE were used to detect the enzyme purity, and to determine its molecular weight. Then the secondary structures of COI at different pH, different temperatures and different concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) were studied by the FT-IR, Fourier self-deconvolution spectra, and circular dichroism (CD). At pH 2.0, the contents of both -helix and anti-parallel -sheet decrease, and that of random coil increases, while -turn is unchanged compared with the neutral condition (pH 7.0). At pH 11.0, the results indicate that the contents of -helix, anti-parallel -sheet and -turn decrease, while random coil structure increases. According to the CD measurements, the relative average fractions of -helix, anti-parallel -sheet, -turn/parallel -sheet, aromatic residues and disulfide bond, and random coil/ -turn are 41.7%, 16.7%, 23.5%, 11.3%, and 6.8% at pH 7.0, respectively, while 7.2%, 7.7%, 15.2%, 10.7%, 59.2% at pH 2.0, and 20.6%, 9.5%, 15.2%, 10.5%, 44.2% at pH 11.0. Both -helix and random coil decrease with temperature increasing, and anti-parallel -sheet increases at the same time. After incubated in 6 mol/L guanidine hydrochloride for 30 min, the fraction of -helix almost disappears (only 1.1% left), while random coil/ -turn increases to 81.8%, which coincides well with the results obtained through enzymatic activity experiment. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction Catechol oxidase or o-diphenol: oxygen-oxidoreductase (CO, EC 1.10.3.1), which catalyses the oxidation of odiphenol and its derivatives to diquinones, is a member of the copper-containing polyphenol oxidase (PPO) family, which consists of catechol oxidase, laccase or p-diphenol: oxygenoxidoreductase (EC 1.10.3.2) and cresolase or monophenol monooxygenase (EC 1.18.14.1). PPO is widely distributed in higher plants, but its biological function has not been defined clearly, although many possible roles have been proposed [1,2,3]. At present, the most likely functions for PPO are its involvement in plant resistance against diseases and insect herbivory [4,5]. For most plant tissues, PPO is com

partmentalized in plastids, whereas its phenolic substrates are located in vacuoles [6]. The action of PPO only occurs when this compartmentation is disrupted after tissues have been wounded, as observed in diseased tissues or those damaged by insect attack. However, an increase in PPO mRNA has been detected in artificially wounded tissues [7,8]. In some plants, the increase in PPO activity and PPO mRNA have been related to the production of compounds (jasmonic acid and methyl jasmonate) of the octadecanoid signal transaction pathway [9,10], but this does not appear to be universal, as several plants had little or no induction of PPO by wounding or treating with methyl jasmonate [11]. Phenoloxidase, similar to PPO, has also been studied [12]. There are four levels of protein structure [13]. The first level is the sequence or primary structure, which can be derived today easily from the polynucleotide sequence that codes the consecutive amino acid residues in a polypep-

tide chain. The next level, the secondary structure or conformation, refers to the arrangement of the backbone of the polypeptide chain. Examples of regular arrangement are the -helix, anti-parallel -sheet, -turn/parallel -sheet, and random coil/ -turn. The folding of segments of secondary structure into a compact molecule is called the tertiary structure. Proteins composed of more than one polypeptide chain, which are arranged in a regular manner also show a fourth level of organization, the quaternary structure. A variety of analytical tools are available to study protein conformation, such as X-ray diffraction, circular dichroism (CD), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), and Raman resonance. Of these methods, FT-IR has been proved to be the most versatile. It allows to analyse protein conformation in different kinds of environments. The versatility of FT-IR is based on the long wavelength of the radiation, which minimizes scattering problems. In addition, a wide range of sampling methods have been developed using transmission, reflection, or emission technique [14]. It is common to compare infrared spectra of a protein recorded in different physical states or sampling techniques on shape, position, and intensity of infrared absorption bands. Although FT-IR has become a common technique to study protein conformation, it is not without pitfalls. Moreover, CD is another effective method to investigate the secondary structure of proteins, especially in solution. The far-UV range of the CD spectrum provides informative data for identifying -helices and sheets on various proteins. In this work, we studied the secondary structure changes of COI from tobacco in the solid state (thin film) at different temperatures, in aqueous solution at different pH and different concentration of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) through determining the far-CD spectra and/or FT-IR spectra.

Sephadex (A-50), Sephadex (G-75), and DEAE-celluse (DE52). PAGE, SDS-PAGE, and MALDI-TOF were used to determine the enzyme purity and its molecular weight. All purification procedures were carried out at 4  C.

2.3. Assay of protein content, activity and purity Protein content was determined according to Bradford method [15] using BSA as the standard. COI activity was determined by spectrophotometric method in a 3-ml cuvette at 25  C. Fifteen microliters of catechol oxidase solution was added to 3 ml of 50 mmol/L catechol in 50 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.3). After standing for 5 min, the reaction mixture was determined for its absorbance at 420 nm. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of the enzyme that causes an increase of 0.01 in absorbance at 420 nm/min under the described conditions. PAGE in the case of nondenaturing was conducted using discontinuous electrophoresis method with Phastsystem, pH 8.3, 250 V, 10 mA, in the concentration gel and 250 V, 30 mA in the separation gel. Protein was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. For SDS-PAGE, the sample was heated in boiling water for 5 min with 2% SDS and -mercaptoethanol, respectively. Gels were also stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. Molecular markers used were lactalbumin (14.4 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20.1 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30.0 kDa), ovalbumin (43.0 kDa), bovin serum albumin (67.0 kDa) and phosphorylase (94.0 kDa).

2.4. FT-IR determination and data analysis Infrared spectra were obtained on a Fourier-transformation spectrometer (Magna-IR-750). The IR cell consisted of a temperature­controlled cell mount and a KBr pellet. The cell temperature was controlled using a thermostat and monitored with a thermocouple placed in close proximity to the KBr pellet. For the pH experiment, the samples were prepared as the follows: 30 L of 30 mg/mL COI solution (pH 7.0, 2.0 and 11.0, respectively) were purged by nitrogen, then mixed with KBr pellet. The cell was assembled and placed in the IR instrument. Each spectrum was an average of 128 scans at a resolution of 2 cm-1 at room temperature within ±0.5  C. As for the thermal experiment, the cell temperature controller was programmed to increase the temperature to desired values. After a 30-min interval at each temperature set for thermal equilibration, the IR spectrum of the sample was collected under the same conditions as above except the temperature. Composite bands of the amide I, amide II and amide III were obtained by using Fourier self-deconvolution (FSD) with an enhancement factor of K = 1.8 and a half width of 30.2 cm-1 .

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials The fresh and light yellow tobacco leaves (Nicotiana tobacum) were harvested directly from the test field belonged to USTC, washed, weighed, packed, and stored at -18  C in refrigerator. DEAE-sephadex A-50, DEAE-celluse DE-52, and sephadex G-75 were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Corporation (Sweden), all of them were pretreated before use; guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl, ultrapure) was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). All other chemical reagents were analytical grade. 2.2. The purification of COI from tobacco COI was isolated and purified from tobacco by using acetone-emerged powder, extraction with phosphate buffer, centrifugation at low temperature, ammonium sulfate fractional precipitation, and column chromatography on DEAE-

2.5. CD studies All CD measurements were performed on a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter at room temperature as previously reported [16]. The spectra of the solution samples were recorded over a wavelength range of 185­245 nm using a cuvette of 1-mm path length at a scanning speed of 10 nm/min and a time constant of 0.125 s. The concentration of each sample was about 0.2 mg/mL (about 5.0 × 10-5 mol/L) in a buffer of 25 mmol/L Tris­HCl and 50 mmol/L NaCl (pH 7.0). The obtained values were normalized by subtracting the baseline recorded for the buffer having the same concentration of salts under similar conditions. The results were expressed in a mean residue ellipticity [] in  cm2 /dmol, which was defined as [] = 100 obs (lc)-1 , where  obs is the observed ellipticity in degree, c is the concentration in residue mol/L, and l is the length of the light path in centimeter.

Fig. 2. Chromatography of COI obtained from the column of Sephadex G-75 on a DEAE-celluse DE-52 (2.6 cm × 60 cm). After the column had been equilibrated with 10 mmol/L sodium phosphate (pH 7.3), the column was washed with a linear gradient of total volume of 1000 mL generated from 500 mL each of 10 mmol/L (pH 7.3) and 100 mmol/L (pH 6.3) sodium phosphate, at the flow rate of 0.25 mL/min and the volume of fraction was 4 mL ( : A280 ; : enzymatic activity).

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Purification of COI from Nicotiana tobacum Two isoenzymes of catechol oxidase from tobacco, named COI and COII, respectively, have been isolated and purified as homogeneous purity determined by PAGE. COI, a monomeric protein, has a molecular weight of 38,000 Da (see Fig. 1), which is further confirmed by MALDI-TOF (not shown), and contains two antiferromagnetically coupled copper ions. The optimal pH and optimal temperature of COI are about 6.5  C and 40  C, respectively. COI does not show the activity of the catalytic oxidation to p-diphenol or mdiphenol, and only possesses a little lower activity to chlorogenic acid. The elution profile of the COI on DE-52 is shown in Fig. 2. The peak of the protein is consistent with that of the enzymatic activity of COI, also indicating the enzyme to be highly pure. The eluate containing COI from the column of DE-52 was pooled together, lyophilized, and used to the determination of CD, FT-IR and Fourier self-deconvolution spectra. 3.2. Effect of pH on the secondary structure of COI 3.2.1. FT-IR results A protein conformation can be defined by a set of dihedral angles i and i and by short-or long-range interactions between different peptide groups, i.e. hydrogen bonding. The relationship between the conformation and the band

Protein was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. The sample was heated in boiling water for 5 min with 2% SDS and -mercaptoethanol, respectively (molecular masses of the standard proteins from top to last second are 97400, 43000, 31000, 20100, 14400, respectively, and the last is bromphenol blue).

position can be understood using the following equation [16,17]: (,  ) = 0 + Dj cos(j) + Dj cos(j )

where the first term 0 corresponds to the unperturbed amide frequency;  and  are the phase angles (0 or ) between adjacent groups in the same chain or in the neighboring chain connected by a hydrogen bond; Dj and Dj are the coupling constants corresponding to the intrachain or interchain interactions. The above equation can describe in principle the splitting and polarization of the amide I band in different conformations. However, it does not provide direct information concerning numerical frequency values or relative intensities. Some vibrations might be so weak as to be virtually unobservable. Others might overlap, resulting in odd-shaped bands with apparently ill-defined absorption maximum [18]. Vibrational spectroscopy is the method usually chosen for detecting and characterizing H-bonded polypeptide conformations. The amide group gives rise to several strong IR bands, the fine structure of which depends on the various types of H-bonded secondary structures and their relative amounts [19]. Like CD, vibrational spectroscopy has a fast time scale (10-3 s). Amide A (N H stretching, between 3450 cm-1 and 3300 cm-1 ) and amide I (carbonyl stretching coupled with in-plane N H bending and C N stretching modes, at 1695­1610 cm-1 ) bands are shifted to lower wavenumber during the formation of hydrogen bonds, while amide II (N H bending and C N stretching, at 1575­1480 cm-1 ) band shifts to higher wavenumber. For example, a change in hydrogen bonding distance of only ° 0.002 A shifts the wavenumber of the amide A band of a polypeptide by approximately 1 cm-1 [20]. This shift is well within the limits of detection of most IR and Raman instruments [20]. Free and hydrogen-bonded species can be visualized as separate bands in the vibrational spectra in contrast to NMR spectra where only time-averaged structures are revealed. The most intense band in the IR spectrum, i.e. the amide I band, consists of a series of overlapped component as a result of the secondary structures in polypeptides. The analysis of the amide I band permits to determine the secondary structures of polypeptides or proteins [19,21,22,23]. In the case of Raman spectra, amide II and amide III (IR inactive, C N stretching, and N H bending, around 1320­1220 cm-1 ) bands can be used to determine the secondary structures of polypeptides [24,25]. The experimental and theoretical bases of IR and Raman band assignments for the secondary structures of polypeptides and proteins containing random coil, -helix and -sheet structures are well established and discussed in several IR [19,21,22,23] and Raman [24,25] reviews. For larger peptides and proteins, the prediction of secondary structures from IR spectra is reliable (the difference between predicted-, X-ray crystallographyand NMR-based structure contents ranges only from 3% to 8%) for proteins containing relatively high percentage of sheet, random coil and -helix but 0% or only small amount

of turns [19]. Especially, the estimation of -sheet structures from IR spectra gives the best results. The infrared spectrum of native COI between 4000 cm-1 and 500 cm-1 is shown in Fig. 3(a). The peak at 3292.9 cm-1 corresponds to the N­H vibration of COI. The peak at 2958.5 cm-1 is caused by C­H vibration. Peaks at the ranges of 1750­1600 cm-1 , 1600­1500 cm-1 , and 1350­1200 cm-1 are assigned as amide I, amide II, and amide III, respectively [26,27]. At pH 2.0 or pH 11.0 (see Fig. 3(b) and (c)), both of amide I and amide II peaks show a little change in the position, but greatly increase in intensities, while the peak at 1286.2 cm-1 of amide III nearly disappears. Fig. 4(a) displays the FSD spectra between 1800 and 1200 cm-1 at pH 7.0. The strong amide I peak at around 1658.5 cm-1 is definitely due to -helix. Peaks, at around 1610 cm-1 (shoulder) and 1286.2 cm-1 , are assigned as the anti-parallel -sheet. The peak at around 1674 cm-1 is caused by -turn [14,28,29,30,31]. The band of random coil at around 1650 cm-1 may overlap with -helix [27,28,29,30]. The peak at 1728.5 cm-1 may be caused jointly by the red shift of 1738 cm-1 assigned as `Free' C O group [31] and the blue shift of 1719 cm-1 assigned as hydrogen bonded C O group [32]. In the acidic condition (pH 2.0, see Fig. 4(b)), a weak band at 1639.8 cm-1 appears clearly, which is designated to the extended peptide chain [33]. At the same time, the intensity of the peak at 1658.5 cm-1 assigned as -helix decreases slightly, and that of the peak at 1538.2 cm-1 (red shift from 1542.6 cm-1 ) caused by random coil is strengthened apparently. The band at 1286.2 cm-1 assigned as the anti-parallel -sheet decreases abruptly, and the peak at 1610 cm-1 almost disappears. From all the above results, we can conclude that the contents of both -helix and anti-parallel -sheet decrease, and that random coil increases while -turn retain unchanged, compared with those at neutral condition. At the basic condition (pH 11.0, see Fig. 4(c)), the absorption at around 1658.5 cm-1 decreases largely compared with pH 7.0 (neutral condition), but increases slightly compared with pH 2.0, which means that COI is a resistance-toalkali protein. The peaks at 1639.8 cm-1 and 1538.2 cm-1 (red shift from 1542.6 cm-1 ), which are assigned as extended polypeptide chain and random coil, respectively, appear obviously. The band at 1610 cm-1 assigned as the anti-parallel -sheet disappears, and the band at 1286.2 cm-1 assigned as the anti-parallel -sheet decreases abruptly. All these indicate that at high pH, -helix contents decreases largely, and that anti-parallel -sheet and -turn also decreases, but that random coil structure increases at the same time. The peak at 1512 cm-1 is caused by the tyrosine ring vibration [18,26,34,35]. 3.2.2. CD spectra Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, the most widely used chiroptical method, has an extreme sensitivity toward protein secondary structure [36]. CD spectroscopy was the first method, which delivered reliable data on the secondary

structure of proteins in solution, in the first place on the ratio of -helix and -sheet conformation [37]. Greenfield and Fasman first proposed a quantitative method of determining protein secondary structure from CD spectra of a synthetic polypeptide, (Lys)n , which can adopt three different conformations under different conditions [38]. The other approach is the determination of basic spectra for a combination of secondary structures from the CD spectra of proteins of known 3D structure [39]. Methods using data sets of proteins with known X-ray crystallographic structure generally decompose the CD spectra into four components: -helix, -sheet, random coil, and turn [40,41]. Generally, CD spectroscopy provides more precise estimates for the -helix [42]. Vibrational spectroscopy (infrared and Raman) was applied from the late 1960s as a complementary approach to CD in determining polypeptide and protein secondary structures [19,43]. The CD spectra of COI from tobacco at different pH are shown in Fig. 5(a and b). At neutral condition, the spectra present two negative peaks at 208 nm and about 222 nm, respectively, indicating that it comprises both -helix and sheet structures. The negative broad peak at 222 nm is usually used to analyse -helix qualitatively, i.e. the higher the absolute value at 222 nm, the more the -helix content is. It is shown that, from pH 7.0 to 6.0, there is a slightly decrease in the absolute value at 222 nm as compared with that at

208 nm. The possible explanation is that COI undergo subtle rearrangements from pH 7.0 to 6.0. It is likely that COI at pH 7.0 appears more compact compared with that at pH 6.0, and that some flexible residues tend to adopt an ordered structure. From pH 6.0 to 5.0, the peak at 208 nm changes a little, but that at 222 nm decreases greatly. From pH 5.0 to 4.0, both of the peaks at 208 nm and 222 nm decrease greatly, indicating that resulting in large decrease in regular arrangement has occurred in COI, which is consistent with our previous studies [44]. From pH 4.0 to 2.0, both of the peaks go on reducing smoothly. From pH 7.0 to 10, the peaks at 208 nm and 222 nm reduce smoothly with no abrupt changes. It can be seen from Fig. 5(b) that both CD spectra at pH 10.0 and 11.0 are nearly superimposable, which means that the secondary structure of COI exhibits a very little change. The relative average fractions of -helix, anti-parallel -sheet, turn/parallel -sheet, aromatic residues and disulfide bond, and random coil/ -turn are calculated using the method of Perczel et al. [45] (see Table 1). 3.3. Effect of temperature on the secondary structure of COI The effect of temperature on the secondary structure of COI was monitored through the measurement of Fourier self-deconvolution (FSD) spectra after incubating

the protein for 30 min at different temperature. The transmittances of the three peaks, which are assigned as -helix (1658.5 cm-1 ), random coil (1538.2 cm-1 ) and anti-parallel -sheet (1286.2 cm-1 ), respectively, are used to evaluate the changes in the secondary structure of COI as a function of temperature. The FSD spectra of COI at 25  C and 150  C are chosen and shown in Fig. 6.

Table 2 shows the effect of the temperature on the secondary structure of COI from tobacco at the temperature range of 25­150  C. On increasing the temperature, there is a decrease in the intensity and a shift in the position of the peak at 1658.5 cm-1 (to 1662.3 cm-1 finally). This shift may be caused by the emergence of 1674 cm-1 assigned as -turn [28,29,30]. This trend can be interpreted in terms of

is difficult to say whether random coil decreases with temperature increasing. There is a decrease in absorbance at 1286.2 cm-1 and it indicates that anti-parallel -sheet reduces with temperature increasing, too. 3.4. Effect of GdnHCl on the secondary structure of COI Our previous experimental results indicated that incubating COI at 6 mol/L GdnHCl for 30 min at 25  C inactivated the enzymatic activity completely (not shown). In this work, we determined the effect of GdnHCl concentration on the CD spectra of COI. The solution for the CD experiments were prepared from the stock solution of the protein and GdnHCl prepared in 20 mmol/L Tris­HCl buffer, pH 7.2. The concentration of the concentrated stock solution of GdnHCl was determined refractometrically [46]. According to the method described by Muzammil et al. [47], different volumes of the buffer were added to a stock protein solution first, and then the denaturant to get the desired concentration of GdnHCl. The final solution mixture was incubated at 25  C for 30 min before CD measurements. Fig. 7 is the CD spectra of COI performed at different concentrations of GdnHCl. We can conclude that the abrupt unfolding of COI starts between 0.0 and 1.0 mol/L GdnHCl and nearly completes at about 5.0 mol/L. The relative

an increase in -turn structure at the expense of -helical structure at higher temperatures. Nevertheless, significant helical absorption is observed at 1662.3 cm-1 (jointly caused by 1658.5 cm-1 assigned as -helix and 1674 cm-1 assigned as -turn) up to 150  C, revealing that COI from tobacco retains secondary structure at high temperature. On increasing temperature, the band at 1538.2 cm-1 also decreases gradually and shifts its position to 1530.5 cm-1 at 150  C, which exceeds the normal range of 1538.2 ± 2 cm-1 , therefore it

average fractions of -helix, anti-parallel -sheet, turn/parallel -sheet, aromatic residues and disulfide bond, and random coil/ -turn at different concentrations of GdnHCl are also calculated using the method proposed by Perczel et al. [45] (see Table 3). After COI has been incubated in 6 mol/L GdnHCl for 30 min, the fraction of -helix almost disappears (only 1.1% left), while random coil/ -turn increases to 81.8%, which coincides well with the result obtained through enzymatic activity experiment.

4. Conclusion From tobacco, a novel copper-containing enzyme named COI has been isolated and purified to homogeneous purity. PAGE and SDS-PAGE are used to detect the protein purity, and to determine its molecular weight. COI is a monomeric protein, and has a molecular weight of 38,000 Da, which is further confirmed by MALDI-TOF, and contains two antiferromagnetically coupled copper ions. The optimum pH and optimum temperature of COI are about 6.5 and 40  C, respectively. COI does not show the activity of the catalytic oxidation to p-diphenol or m-diphenol, and only possesses a little lower activity to chlorogenic acid. At pH 2.0, the contents of both the -helix and the anti-parallel -sheet decrease, and that of the random coil structure increases while the -turn retain unchanged, compared with those at neutral condition (pH 7.0). At pH 11.0, the results indicate that the contents of -helix, anti-parallel -sheet and -turn all decrease, but random coil structure increases at the same time. According to the CD measurements, the relative average fractions of -helix, anti-parallel -sheet, -turn/parallel -sheet, aromatic residues and disulfide bond, and random coil/ -turn are 41.7%, 16.7%, 23.5%, 11.3%, and 6.8% at pH 7.0, respectively, while 7.2%, 7.7%, 15.2%, 10.7%, 59.2% at pH 2.0 and 20.6%, 9.5%, 15.2%, 10.5%, 44.2% at pH 11.0. Both -helix and random coil decrease with temperature increasing, and anti-parallel sheet increases at the same time. It is interesting that random coil doesn't increase with the temperature increasing. After COI has been incubated in 6 mol/L GdnHCl for 30 min, the fraction of -helix almost disappears (only 1.1% left), while random coil/ -turn increases to 81.8%, which coincides well with the result obtained through enzymatic activity experiment.
