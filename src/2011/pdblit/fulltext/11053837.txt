The atomic resolution structure of bucandin, a novel toxin isolated from the Malayan krait, determined by direct methods
Bucandin is a novel presynaptic neurotoxin isolated from Bungarus candidus (Malayan krait). It has the unique property of enhancing presynaptic acetylcholine release and represents a family of three-®nger toxins with an additional disul®de in the ®rst loop. There are no existing structures from this sub-category of three-®nger toxins. The X-ray crystal structure of bucandin has been determined by the Shake-andBake direct-methods procedure. The resulting electrondensity maps were of outstanding quality and allowed the automated tracing of 61 of the 63 amino-acid residues, including their side chains, and the placement of 48 solvent Ê molecules. The 0.97 A resolution full-matrix least-squares re®nement converged to a crystallographic R factor of 12.4% and the ®nal model contains 118 solvent molecules. This is the highest resolution structure of any member of the three-®nger toxin family and thus it can serve as the best model for other members of the family. Furthermore, the structure of this novel toxin will help in understanding its unique ability to enhance acetylcholine release. The unique structure resulting from the ®fth disul®de bond residing in the ®rst loop improves the understanding of other toxins with a similar arrangement of disul®de bonds.

1. Introduction
Snake-venom toxins are used as research tools and play an important role in the development of therapeutic agents. These toxins belong to a small number of protein superfamilies. Among these, the three-®nger toxin family is a well characterized group of non-enzymatic polypeptides. They exhibit diverse pharmacological effects. Members of this family include postsynaptic neurotoxins, cardiotoxins and cytotoxins, fasciculins, platelet-aggregation inhibitors and speci®c ion-channel blockers. The three-dimensional structures of several three-®nger toxins have been determined to date. These include cardiotoxin (Rees et al., 1990), fasciculin (Le Du et al., 1992), erabutoxin a and b (Cor®eld et al., 1989; Smith et al., 1988), - and -bungarotoxin (Love & Stroud, 1986; Dewan et al., 1994) and -cobratoxin (Betzel et al., 1991). Despite the functional diversity, they all share similar protein-folding characteristics: three -stranded loops extending from a central core, containing four conserved disul®de bonds. Some members, such as the long-chain neurotoxins and -bungarotoxins, have an additional disul®de bond in loop 2 which serves to lock its extremity (Menez et al., 1992; Rees & Bilwes, 1993; Menez, 1993, 1998). Bucandin consists of 63 amino-acid residues and a comparison (Fig. 1) of toxin sequences shows that it is most similar to the toxin S6C4 isolated from Dendroaspis j.

kaimosae (68.8% identity). A sequence identity of 30±40% is found when comparing bucandin with other three-®nger toxins. This high degree of sequence homology results mostly from the conserved disul®de bonds (which constitute 10±15% of the sequence identity) and some additional residues forming the core -sheet lattice in which the functional residues are most likely to be located. Bucandin is a novel presynaptic toxin. Most presynaptic toxins are either phospholipase A2 enzymes or contain these enzymes as an integral part of the neurotoxin complex. These toxins inhibit the release of acetylcholine (ACh). However, the mechanisms of inhibition vary and have not yet been completely delineated. Dendrotoxins, in contrast, bind to potassium channels and thus induce the release of ACh (Rees & Bilwes, 1993; Menez, 1993). Atrotoxin is a presynaptic neurotoxin isolated from the venom of the black widow spider Latrodectus tredecimguttatus (Menez, 1993). It exerts toxic effects in the vertebrate central nervous system by increasing the internal concentration of calcium ions and thereby depolarizing neurones and also by stimulating uncontrolled exocytosis of neurotransmitters from nerve terminals. Bucandin is the ®rst toxin that enhances the release of ACh. Therefore, it is important to understand the structural features of this novel toxin. In this paper, we report the identi®cation, characterization, sequencing and structure determination of a new snakevenom toxin, bucandin. The structure of this toxin will help in understanding its unique ability to enhance acetylcholine release. column; the proteins in this peak were further fractionated on a reversed-phase HPLC column. The major protein peak was named bucandin. It was shown to be homogeneous by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Bucandin has a molecular mass of 7275.43 Æ 0.32 Da and represents about 2±3% of the crude venom. Amino-terminal sequencing of the native and pyridylethylated protein (Cavins & Friedman, 1970; Kini & Evans, 1989) was performed by automated Edman degradation using a Perkin±Elmer Applied Biosystems 494 pulsed liquid-phase protein sequencer (Procise) with an on-line 785A PTH amino-acid analyzer. This allowed the precise identi®cation of all amino-acid residues and revealed the complete sequence of both native (blank cycles where Cys residues are found) and pyridylethylated bucandin samples. Bucandin consists of 63 amino-acid residues including ten cysteine residues. The calculated mass is 7275.24 Da.
2.2. Crystallization

Crystallization conditions were established using the sparsematrix method. The bucandin crystals were grown by vapor diffusion from hanging drops containing a 1:1(v/v) ratio of protein stock solution (3 ml, 10 mg mlÀ1) to well solution (3 ml) at room temperature. The well solution contained 30% 2-propanol, 0.1 M Tris±HCl pH 8.5 and 0.2 M ammonium acetate. Crystals belong to the space group C2, with unit-cell Ê parameters a = 76.97, b = 22.52, c = 32.60 A,  =  = 90,  = 100.23 , and contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit.
2.3. X-ray data collection and processing

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Isolation and purification

Bucandin was puri®ed to homogeneity by a two-step protocol as follows. The B. candidus venom was isolated from its native source by separating the crude venom into seven fractions on a Superdex 30 gel-®ltration column. The last protein fraction was eluted after the salt volume of the

Following the addition of 2 ml of 50% glycerol as a cryoprotectant to the crystallization drop, a single crystal of bucandin with approximate dimensions 20 Â 20 Â 250 mm was rapidly immersed into a stream of evaporated liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at SSRL BL9-1 at a temperature of 183 K maintained by a cold nitrogen-gas stream (Bellamy et al., 1994). A MAR345 imaging-plate detector was mounted on the beamline, which was operated at Ê a wavelength of 0.98 A. A total of 33 363 re¯ections were measured in the resolution range 32.0± Ê 0.97 A. The data were integrated and scaled using MOSFLM (Leslie, 1991) and SCALA (Evans, 1993) and resulted in a 99.5% complete data set, with a multiplicity of 3.7 and an Rmerge of 5.5% (Table 1).

implementations of the Shake-and-Bake dual-space directmethods procedure (Weeks et al., 1994) were used to derive independent ab initio solutions from the X-ray diffraction data. For the SnB v2.0 structure determination, normalized structure-factor magnitudes (E values) were calculated for all Ê diffraction data in the resolution range 32.0±1.1 A using the programs LEVY and EVAL (Blessing et al., 1996), which are built into the SnB v2.0 program. The 5000 largest of these E values were then used to generate 50 000 triplet invariants. A total of 542 random trials were processed and each trial was subjected to 500 cycles of real-space (peak-picking) and reciprocal-space (parameter-shift) re®nement. The ®nal minimal functions of these trials were clearly bimodal (Hauptman, 1991), where the minimal function of one of these trials (Rmin = 0.452) was signi®cantly lower than the rest of the trials (Rmin = 0.475±0.502). The SHELXD program calculates its own E values. Data Ê were cut to a resolution of 1.05 A, as the average I/'(I) fell below 2.0 beyond this resolution. Starting from a trial set of random atoms, phases were re®ned by the tangent formula (Karle, 1968) in reciprocal space, alternating with the selection of the 150 highest peaks in an E map calculated using the strongest E magnitudes (3452 E values > 1.4). An average of 98.8 triplets were used for each phase. One-third of these potential atoms were then eliminated at random. After 150 such real-space/reciprocal-space iterations, possible solutions were screened by checking the value of the correlation coef®cient (CC) between observed and calculated normalized structure-factor amplitudes based on all data (Fujinaga & Read, 1987). Partial solutions with a CC of above 40% invariably led to a full structure solution. These partial solutions were expanded by eight cycles of progressively incorporating more atoms coupled with peak-list optimization (Sheldrick & Gould, 1995). Peaks were eliminated from bottom to top whenever this led to an improvement in the CC. These full solutions were characterized by a ®nal CC of

greater than 78%. After 1000 random trials, the structure had been solved ®ve times, each leading to the correct location of 500 atoms. The presence of ®ve disul®de bridges accelerated the structure solution because it enabled a relatively small subset of atoms ($100) to be located within the internal loop using only the strongest data. Bucandin is the largest structure determined de novo by the SnB v2.0 program, although the program has been used on some larger test cases such as triclinic lysozyme (Deacon et al., 1998); it is also one of the largest structures determined by SHELXD, although two larger all light-atom structures (V-amylose and mersacidin) with 624 atoms plus 147 solvent sites and 750 atoms plus 100 solvent sites, respectively, have been solved recently (Gessler et al., 1999; Schneider et al., 2000). The resulting electron-density maps were of excellent quality (Figs. 2a and 2b). In principle, it was possible to build an initial model by selecting individual peaks from one solution or by subjecting a ' A map (Read et al., 1986) obtained Â after B-value re®nement of an unexpurgated solution (Uson et al., 1999) to standard protein map-tracing methods. However, in our case the phases output from the SnB v2.0 solution were input directly into the program wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999), which proceeded quickly from an initial trace of 48 residues broken into four discrete chains to a ®nal trace, after ten cycles, of 61 residues in a single polypeptide chain. Subsequent automated side-chain docking against the known amino-acid sequence allowed the correct placement of 70% of the sidechain groups. An additional two residues at the C- and N-termini and the remainder of the side chains were ®tted manually using the XtalView suite of programs (McRee, 1992). The complete SnB solution and automated tracing and building were accomplished within 24 h.
2.5. Structure refinement

The subsequent re®nement of the initial model against the diffraction data was carried out with SHELXL (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). The data-to-parameter ratio of 5.8 allowed the re®nement of anisotropic temperature factors, as judged by a drop of 4.97% in the Rfree (based on 5% randomly

selected re¯ections which were omitted from all re®nement cycles except for the ®nal round). The standard conjugategradient least-squares re®nement converged after two rounds of manual re®tting to a crystallographic R factor of 13.2% Ê (Rfree = 15.8%) for all data in the resolution range 32.0±0.97 A. This was followed by full-matrix least-squares re®nement in which the model, containing H atoms, was re®ned against all data. This converged to an R factor of 12.4%. The ®nal model contained all 63 amino-acid residues, of which three show two distinct conformations, and 118 solvent molecules. The side chain for Glu20 was disordered and could not be interpreted from the electron-density maps and was omitted from the ®nal model (truncated to the CB position). A ®nal round of fullmatrix least-squares re®nement in SHELXL allowed the estimation of standard deviations on the atomic coordinates from the inversion of the least-squares matrix. This indicated Ê an average coordinate error of about 0.029 A. The ®nal model exhibited good stereochemical geometry (Table 2). All stereochemical parameters are within the expected margins and the Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran et al., 1974) shows 86.2% of residues in the most favoured and 13.8% in the additional allowed region, with none in the generously allowed or disallowed region as de®ned in PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Electrostatic potentials for bucandin were calculated with GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Description of the overall structure

The structure of bucandin comprises two antiparallel -sheets. The ®rst sheet contains two strands: 1 (residues 1±5) and 2 (residues 13±17) from loop 1, while the other contains four strands: 3 (residues 23±28), 4 (residues 35±39), 5 (residues 45±48) and 6 (residues 51±57) from loops 2 and 3 (Figs. 3a and 3b). This is the ®rst known toxin structure to have an additional fourth strand (5) in the main -sheet. The formation of this fourth strand causes the bucandin molecule to be extremely ¯at, with dimensions of Ê approximately 36 Â 24 Â 12 A. Bucandin contains ®ve disul®de bonds, of which four (Cys3ÐCys24, Cys17ÐCys39, Cys43ÐCys55 and Cys56ÐCys61) occur in the central core of the molecule, similar to many other three-®nger toxins. As expected, the ®fth disul®de (Cys6ÐCys11) is located in the ®rst loop, where it disrupts the -sheet and stabilizes an unusual kink, causing the -strands to turn nearly 90 with respect to the rest of the molecule. There are exposed hydrophobic residues on both faces of the molecule. One face (face A) has three tryptophans all facing out from the molecule (Fig. 4a). This face also has two small patches of negative and two small patches of positive charge. The opposite face (face B) has a large patch of positive charge located centrally within the molecule (Fig. 4b). Indeed, a dipole vector was calculated which demonstrated the large differences in charge between the two faces of the molecule (Figs. 4a and 4b). The crystal packing diagram does not show any obvious multimer conformations.

Most three-®nger toxins exhibit their pharmacological effects through interaction with speci®c receptors. Erabutoxin, -bungarotoxin and cobratoxin all bind to the postsynaptic ACh receptor (AChR) of the neuromuscular junction (Rees & Bilwes, 1993). Another member of the three-®nger toxin family, -neurotoxin, acts on postsynaptic AChRs of the central nervous system rather than the peripheral neuromuscular junctions (Menez et al., 1992), while cardiotoxins have a multitude of effects with poorly understood mechanisms. The platelet-aggregation inhibitor dendroaspin binds to

®brinogen-receptor glycoprotein IIb±IIIa complex and disrupts its interaction with ®brinogen (Sutcliffe et al., 1994), whereas calciseptine binds to L-type calcium channel and blocks the calcium current (Menez, 1993). The mechanism of the presynaptic action of bucandin is unknown; however, its structure does suggest some possibilities. The unusual kink in the ®rst loop could be useful in isolating this portion of the structure and preventing any interference with the charges in the rest of the molecule or it could also function to rigidify the molecule and thereby facilitate some speci®c interactions. This is unlike other -neurotoxins, which have loops that are in closer proximity to the rest of the molecule (Fig. 5). The A side with its unique tryptophan array may be involved in interacting with an unidenti®ed presynaptic receptor/acceptor protein, while the electrostatic charges could provide some initial speci®c coulombic interactions, similar to toxins which target AChR. Alternatively, the hydrophobic patch on side A

this general membranedisruption hypothesis less likely than bucandin acting as a neurotoxin upon a speci®c receptor. Further studies are essential to identify the precise interaction site and understand its structure±function relationships. Such studies will help in developing therapeutic agents against myasthenia gravis, where even though the ACh is released normally, its effect on the post-synaptic membrane is reduced owing to a decrease in the number of AchRs (Drachman, 1994). Bucandin may provide a better alternative to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, leading to substantial ACh accumulation at the neuromuscular junction and a prolonged enhancement of neuromuscular transmission.

4. Conclusions
The atomic resolution structure of bucandin reveals the unique feature of the ®fth disul®de, which twists the ®rst loop away from the rest of the molecule. The highly dipolar nature of the molecule suggests that the molecule may be attaching to a hydrophobic patch on a complementary receptor surface after being attracted to its binding location by the charged residues on the opposing face of the ¯at bucandin molecule. The twist in the ®rst loop could also serve to help isolate it away from the rest of the molecule and thereby allow the rest of the molecule to participate in interactions with its receptor. Alternatively, the twist could facilitate interactions between bucandin and its receptor by creating a more rigid molecule, allowing more speci®c interactions. Further biochemical studies of bucandin and structural studies of other three-®nger toxins with similar disul®de arrangements will allow a better correlation between this unique structural property and the molecular function.
