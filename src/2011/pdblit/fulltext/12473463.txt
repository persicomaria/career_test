The crystal structure of cyanovirin-N (CV-N), a protein with potent antiÊ viral activity, was solved at 1.5 A resolution by molecular replacement using as the search model the solution structure previously determined by NMR. The crystals belong to the space group P3221 with one monomer of CV-N in each asymmetric unit. The primary structure of CV-N contains 101 residues organized in two domains, A (residues 1 to 50) and B (residues 51 to 101), with a high degree of internal sequence and structural similarity. We found that under the conditions of the crystallographic experiments (low pH and 26 % isopropanol), two symmetrically related monomers form a dimer by domain swapping, such that domain A of one monomer interacts with domain BH of its crystallographic symmetry mate and vice versa. Because the two swapped domains are distant from each other, domain swapping does not result in additional intramolecular interactions. Even though one of the protein sample solutions that was used for crystallization clearly contained 100 % monomeric CV-N molecules, as judged by various methods, we were only able to obtain crystals containing domain-swapped dimers. With the exception of the unexpected phenomenon of domain swapping, the crystal structure of CV-N is very similar to the NMR structure, with a root-mean-square Ê deviation of 0.55 A for the main-chain atoms, the best agreement reported to date for structures solved using both techniques.

Introduction
Virucides interact directly with virions to reduce or inhibit viral transmission. The highly potent virucidal protein cyanovirin-N (CV-N) irreversibly inactivates diverse strains of human immunode®ciency virus (HIV). CV-N was originally isolated from an extract of the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum (blue-green algae), after its activity was detected in an anti-HIV screen. However, the physiological function of CV-N in N. ellipsosporum remains unknown. Biochemical assays have shown

that CV-N binds with a high degree of af®nity to the viral surface envelope glycoprotein gp120 (Boyd et al., 1997; Mori et al., 1997a,b), and that such binding is essential for the antiviral activity of CV-N. Immunoblots did not show signi®cant binding of CV-N to HIV proteins other than gp120 (Boyd et al., 1997). The binding of CV-N to soluble gp120 did not interfere with the binding of either soluble CD4 or antibodies directed to the V3 loop or the CD4 binding site, suggesting that CV-N interferes with the interactions of gp120 and other cellular receptors and/or with the conformational changes of gp120 required for viral fusion and entry. Recent studies employing cell-associated gp120 indicated that CV-N could block both CD4dependent and CD4-independent binding and fusion of HIV-1 with cells (Esser et al., 1999).

404 CV-N offers considerable promise as a focus for novel prevention, and possibly also treatment strategies for AIDS, in part due to its broad spectrum of activity against immunode®ciency retroviruses. CV-N can irreversibly inactivate diverse laboratory strains and primary isolates of HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunode®ciency virus (SIV; Boyd et al., 1997). Due to the high mutation rate of HIV, drugresistant strains can evolve rapidly following administration of most anti-HIV drugs. Thus, a drug that could effectively prevent initial viral infection would be more likely to prevent the emergence of drug-resistant virus. Although cellto-cell fusion and transmission of HIV infection can be irreversibly inhibited in vitro at low nanomolar concentrations of CV-N, this protein is not toxic to CEM-SS cells or peripheral blood lymphocytes, even at concentrations as high as 9 mM (Boyd et al., 1997). Finally, CV-N is highly stable and resistant to irreversible denaturation caused by elevated temperature or other denaturation agents (Boyd et al., 1997). In addition to direct virucidal applications, another potential application of CV-N in AIDS therapy is its successful use in creating a recombinant chimeric toxin molecule in which the translocation and cytotoxic domains of Pseudomonas exotoxin A are linked to CV-N (Mori et al., 1997b). In this chimeric molecule, CV-N serves as the targeting moiety that searches for HIV-infected cells expressing gp120. The chimeric molecule shows enhanced cytotoxicity for HIV-infected H9 cells compared with uninfected H9 cells, indicating the feasibility of using CV-N to selectively target and destroy HIV-infected host cells. CV-N is a single polypeptide chain consisting of 101 amino acid residues, with a calculated molecular mass of 11,013 Da. Based on its primary structure, CV-N was expected to contain two domains with a high degree of similarity in both the primary and tertiary structures (Gustafson et al., 1997). These similarities were indeed observed in the NMR solution structure of CV-N (Bewley et al., 1998). With the exception of this internal sequence similarity, sequence comparison searches showed no signi®cant similarity between CV-N and any other protein. CV-N contains four cysteine residues that form two intramolecular disul®de bonds (Cys8 - Cys22 and Cys58 - Cys73), which are well aligned with each other within their domains except for a single amino acid gap. These disul®de bonds are important for the structural stability and anti-HIV activity of CV-N. Reduction of the bonds and alkylation of the resulting free cysteine residues abolished the anti-HIV activity (Gustafson et al., 1997). The solution structure of CV-N was solved by NMR using a number of novel restraints, including 1 H and 13C shifts, 3J couplings, and residual dipolar couplings (Clore & Gronenborn, 1998). The latter, in contrast to other NMR observations that are dependent on close spatial proximity of atoms Ê (<5 A), provide a priori long-range structural infor-

mation (Tjandra et al., 1997). Although the resulting ensemble of structures has a high degree of internal consistency (with a backbone precision of Ê 0.2 A), the impact of re®nement against residual dipolar couplings on the resulting coordinate accuracy has not been previously validated by comparison to a subsequently solved high-resolution X-ray structure. Moreover, comparison of the high-resolution X-ray and NMR structures of CV-N provides an opportunity to compare the results of these two principal methods of determining atomic protein structures, this time for high-resolution/high-quality structures, as opposed to lower resolution/ quality structures which were the subject of most comparisons in the past (Baldwin et al., 1991; Rozwarski et al., 1994).

Results
Crystals of CV-N belong to the space group Ê P3221, with unit cell parameters of a  b  48.07 A, Ê c  79.08 A (Table 1) and with one monomer in each asymmetric unit. The Matthews coef®cient Ê and the solvent content are 2.39 A3/dalton and 48.2 %, respectively. Using the NMR structure of CV-N as the search model, we readily found a solution with the correct space group enantiomorph, using molecular replacement methods as implemented in the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). Several cycles of re®nement, followed by manual adjustments of a number of side-chains and by the addition of water molecules, reduced the È crystallographic Rcryst and Rfree (Brunger, 1992a) to Ê 19.2 % and 21.1 %, respectively, at 1.5 A resolution. The re®ned crystal structure based directly on the NMR model was well determined, except for residues 50 to 53, which are part of the linker region between the two domains that form a compact molecule in the NMR-determined structure. In that structure, the linker did not show any apparent disorder, as indicated by similar positional deviations of the main-chain atoms of the linker when compared with the other parts of the protein. In the initial crystallographic re®nement of CV-N in which a monomeric model was assumed, however, the electron density around the linker was practically non-existent (Figure 1). This result was

In addition, in the 2Fo À Fc map contoured at the 1 s level, we observed continuous electron densities that connected residue 49 of one molecule

to residue 53 of its crystallographic symmetry mate (Figure 2). To con®rm this observation, we built and re®ned a model of CV-N that consisted of two domains from two monomers connected by a new linker. Hereinafter, we refer to this new model as the domain-swapped (dimeric) structure (Figure 3). Re®nement of the domain-swapped structure reduced the average temperature factors of resi-

Ê dues 50 to 53 to slightly more than 20 A2 (Table 2). The electron density around the new linker is of acceptable quality and, in addition, signi®cant positive electron-density peaks appeared around this region in the omit Fo À Fc map after the occupancies of the four residues were set to zero (Figure 2(c)). The result that CV-N exists in crystals only as a domain-swapped dimer was unexpected, in view of the predominantly monomeric nature of the protein in solution. Therefore, we also grew crystals from a sample that was independently determined to be monomeric by gel ®ltration and NMR. A Ê data set extending to 1.75 A was collected from one of these crystals. In a procedure identical with the one described above, the NMR solution structure was used as the starting model for an inde-

pendent re®nement; nevertheless, the domainswapped structure was again observed. Compared with its conformation in the NMR structure, the linker region is extended in the domain-swapped structure. The distance between Ê the Ca atoms of residues 49 and 54 is 10.2 A in the Ê in the domainNMR structure, whereas it is 13.8 A swapped crystal structure. The program PROCHECK showed that all four linker residues in the domain-swapped structure are in the most favored Ramachandran region for random coil, whereas for the crystallographic monomeric structure, one is in the most favored and three are in the generously allowed region. The good geometry of the linker in the domain-swapped structure is further evidence of its existence in the crystals. Although only the residues from Gln50 to Asn53 needed large adjust-

407 in the puri®cation procedure, or those of the crystallization procedure. A mixture of monomeric and dimeric CV-N is readily obtained by subjecting pure monomeric CV-N to reverse-phase HPLC under acidic conditions (0.05 % tri¯uoroacetic acid). A 1H-15N correlation spectrum of a lyophilized sample of the HPLC-eluted material dissolved in 90 % H2O/10 % 2H2O with a measured pH of 2.1 exhibits two sets of cross-peaks in a ratio of about 7:3. The average 15N T2 for the minor cross-peaks was $20 ms, corresponding to dimeric CV-N, whereas that of the major species was 40 ms, corresponding to monomeric CV-N. Following direct injection of this low pH sample onto an analytical gel ®ltration column equilibrated in 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7), 20 % of dimeric CV-N was observed and eluted before the remaining 80 % monomeric CV-N. When the low pH sample was adjusted to pH 6.2 and then analyzed by both analytical gel ®ltration (on a column equilibrated in 50 mM PBS, pH 7) and 1H-15N correlation spectroscopy, less than 5 % of the dimeric form of CV-N was observed. Moreover, when the pH was lowered again from 6.2 to 3.0 with HCl, the 1H-15N correlation spectrum showed the presence of only a single set of crosspeaks corresponding to monomeric CV-N. Thus, the monomeric form is stable and not easily converted to the dimeric form except by repeating the HPLC puri®cation procedure or by subjecting it to crystallization conditions (low pH and 26 % isopropanol). Two suggestions have been offered for the ambiguity in de®ning the two domains of CV-N (Bewley et al., 1998). Based on the high degree of internal sequence similarity, the ®rst and second halves of the molecule can be de®ned as domains A and B, which we refer to as sequence-based domain de®nition. By this de®nition, the interactions between the two domains bury a total of Ê about 3085 A2 of accessible surface in the NMR structure (Bewley et al., 1998). To eliminate these interactions, domain A can also be de®ned as consisting of residues 1 to 39 and 90 to 101 and domain B as consisting of residues 40 to 89 (Bewley et al., 1998), which we refer to as structure-based domain de®nition. With the observation of domain swapping, the ambiguity in de®ning the domains may be resolved. The domain-swapped crystal structure shows a ¯exible linker, or a hinge, extending between residues 49 and 54. Thus, the two sequence-based domains move around the hinge as rigid bodies, forming either a monomer by intramolecular domain interactions (domain A with domain B) or a dimer by intermolecular domain swapping (domain A with domain BH , and domain B with domain AH ). There are no interactions between domains A and AH , or B and BH , except for Glu41. Thus the sequence-based domain de®nition may be more accurate in the case of CV-N. Domain swapping is a phenomenon that has been discussed for a long time, although its importance has been emphasized only recently

ments, comparison of the f and c torsion angles showed that the linker extends from Trp49 to Phe54, since the differences in these angles exceed 20  for these residues (Table 3). Except for the linker region and some ¯exible side-chains, the domain-swapped structure shares all other structural features of the NMR structure (Bewley et al., 1998), with a high degree of structural similarity between the two domains (Figure 4). The shape of the monomer in the domainswapped CV-N structure resembles a bent dumbbell, rather than the football-like monomeric structure. Because there are no direct interactions between the two domains, this structure is probably stable only in the dimeric form. The individual domains in the domain-swapped structure are very similar to each other and to their counterparts in the monomeric crystal structure. Comparing the NMR and crystal structures, we found that the positional RMS deviations of all main-chain atoms Ê Ê between domains A and B are 1.32 A and 1.31 A, respectively (Figure 4). Domains A and B in the crystal structure can be ®tted separately with their counterparts in the NMR structure, and the positional RMS deviations of all main-chain atoms Ê Ê except for the linker region are 0.52 A and 0.54 A, respectively. If domains A and BH in the dimer are ®tted to the whole monomer of the NMR structure, the positional RMS deviation of all main-chain Ê atoms except for the linker region is 0.55 A.

Discussion
CV-N crystal structures indicated the presence of domain swapping, regardless of whether the crystals were grown from a mixture of dimers and monomers or from purely monomeric samples. However, there is no question that the monomer is the predominant form of CV-N in solution (Figure 5). In particular, analytical ultracentrifugation of the major fraction eluted from a preparative gel ®ltration column (>95 %) yielded a measured molecular mass of 10,850 Da compared with a predicted mass of 11,013 Da. Furthermore, the sample behaves well, with no evidence of intermolecular association or the existence of a mixture of noninterconverting monomeric and dimeric species. At 35 C, the samples of CV-N used for NMR had 1HN and 15N T2 values of $40 ms and 150 (Æ2) ms, respectively, with a rotational correlation time of 4.5 ns and a diffusion anisotropy of 1.5. The values of these relaxation and hydrodynamic parameters are consistent only with a monomer of 10 to 11 kDa. In addition, the measured dipolar couplings are not consistent with the relative orientations of the two halves (A/BH and AH /B) observed in the dimeric crystal form. Because the form that crystallized is a domainswapped dimer, we investigated the origin of the dimeric form. It appears that the domain-swapped dimer can be formed under certain suitable conditions such as those of reverse-phase HPLC used

408 (Schlunegger et al., 1997). It was ®rst reported for RNase A more than 35 years ago (Crest®eld et al., 1962), and its ®rst description in a high-resolution structure was provided for a related BS-RNase (Mazzarella et al., 1993; Piccoli et al., 1992). Since then, a number of other proteins, such as diphtheria toxin (DT; Bennett & Eisenberg, 1994; Bennett et al., 1995) and CksHs2 (Parge et al., 1993), have been found to share this feature. The mechanism and evolution of domain swapping have been analyzed (Xu et al., 1998) and reviewed (Bennett et al., 1995). With both monomeric and dimeric states discovered, CV-N provides another example of such a phenomenon. In this particular case, it is

clear that the monomeric state is predominant under physiological conditions, as shown by ultracentrifugation, analytical gel ®ltration, and NMR. In the experiments described here, it seems that the dimeric form of CV-N can be generated either during puri®cation by reverse-phase HPLC or during crystallization (low pH and 26 % isopropanol). Under these conditions, the pH of the solution can be quite acidic and the local protein concentration can be much higher. Interestingly, these are also the conditions required for the dimerization of DT (Bennett & Eisenberg, 1994). The decrease in pH was proposed to convert monomeric DT to an open form, which then dimerizes by domain swap-

ping at the high concentrations of the eutectic mixture as the pH returns to neutral during thawing (Bennett & Eisenberg, 1994). Similarly, RNase A is also believed to form an open monomer at low pH and during lyophilization (Crest®eld et al., 1962). Domain swapping has been proposed as one of the possible pathways for the evolution of protein oligomerization (Bennett et al., 1995; Xu et al., 1998). Instead of the unlikely event of mutating pairs of residues on the dimer interface simultaneously, domain swapping provides a stable prototype of a dimer for further evolution (Bennett et al., 1995). The crystal structure of interleukin-10

(IL-10) may provide a good example of such a phenomenon (Zdanov et al., 1995). IL-10 forms a tight dimer made of two interpenetrating subunits that are stabilized by one intramolecular disul®de bond. The normal monomer of IL-10 cannot exist in solution, since it has many exposed hydrophobic residues. However, rotating a segment of one monomer to the position of its counterpart in the other monomer is prohibited by the intramolecular disul®de bond. It seems that the evolutionary process results in the elimination of the monomeric IL10 and only the dimeric form is allowed to exist. CV-N has some unique features compared with IL-

10, DT, and other domain-swapped proteins. The sequence of CV-N indicates that a single molecule of CV-N is probably the result of gene duplication, so that the two domains have a high degree of similarity, whereas the domains of other domainswapped proteins are usually unrelated. Thus, the interactions between domains A and B in monomeric CV-N molecules may also represent domain swapping or segment swapping. From the solution data, it is clear that CV-N is predominantly monomeric at neutral pH and the conversion of the minor dimeric form seen after HPLC puri®cation at low pH to the monomeric form upon raising the pH is largely irreversible. We observed, however, that HPLC may not be the only condition leading to dimerization, since crys-

tals containing domain-swapped dimers were also grown from purely monomeric protein, so that the presence of the precipitating agents might also lead to domain swapping. Crystallographic data verifying these phenomena are quite unambiguous. Although the absence of the electron density connecting residues 50 and 53 in the monomeric model would not by itself be suf®cient to postulate such molecular organization, the presence of a clear electron density connecting the two crystallographically related molecules cannot be disregarded in the structure re®ned at a resolution as Ê high as 1.5 A. Although the dimeric species was the minor components or not present in the samples used for crystallization, only that form of protein could be crystallized. Crystallization of other minor components of protein samples has been reported previously (Duquerroy et al., 1994). The exclusive crystallization of the domainswapped form of CV-N would have led to incorrect identi®cation of the normal state of the mol-

Crystallization trials were also set up using a nearly 100 % monomeric CV-N sample under the crystallization conditions described above. A single crystal diffraction data set was collected on a Mar345 image plate detector using CuKa radiation generated by a Rigaku rotatinganode X-ray generator. A crystal was ¯ash-frozen at 100 K using an Oxford Cryosystems device. The data set Ê was processed at 1.75 A using the HKL suite (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997), and the structure was re®ned using CNS as described above. Protein Data Bank accession numbers

At this time we do not know if the domain-swapped form of CV-N has any relevance to its antiviral activity, although the possibility that such structures exist should be kept in mind when analyzing the interactions with its viral target.

Materials and Methods
Recombinant CV-N was expressed in Escherichia coli; the cloning and initial puri®cation methods are described elsewhere (Mori et al., 1998). Final puri®cation of the sample employed reverse-phase HPLC eluting with an acetonitrile-water gradient containing 0.05 % tri¯uoroacetic acid. Acetonitrile was removed from the CV-N-containing HPLC eluant by rotary evaporation; the residual water and tri¯uoroacetic acid were removed by lyophilization. Lyophilized CV-N was dissolved in deionized water, and crystallization conditions were established using the Crystal Screen I kit from Hampton Research. After several days of hanging-drop vapor diffusion experiments (Wlodawer & Hodgson, 1975) many small crystals were observed in a droplet containing 20 % (v/v) isopropanol, 0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.2 M calcium chloride (pH 4.6). The mother liquor conditions were further re®ned to 26 % (v/v) isopropanol, 0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.15 M calcium chloride, 5 % (v/v) polyethylene glycol 400, pH 4.4. Crystals grew to the size of 50 mm Â 50 mm Â 50 mm after two or three days. A single CV-N crystal was ¯ash-frozen at 100 K and a Ê 1.5 A resolution X-ray diffraction data set was collected Ê at the wavelength of 0.9795 A, with a four-element ADSC CCD detector on the synchrotron beamline F2 at CHESS (Cornell University). Diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL suite (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The structure was solved by molecular replacement methods using the NMR structure as the search model by the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). È The early stages of re®nement utilized X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992b) and SHELXL-97 (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997), and ®nally, CNS using maximum-likelihood methods È (Brunger et al., 1998). The molecular graphics program O (Jones & Kieldgaard, 1997) was used to rebuild the model, and PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) was used to assess the quality of the structure. Several experiments were conducted to investigate the transformation between the dimer and the monomer. Equilibrium sedimentation studies were carried out using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge at 20  C and analyzed using the Beckman XL-A analysis software. Analytical gel ®ltration studies were performed using both a Superdex-75 column (10 mm Â 30 cm, Pharmacia Biotech, NJ) and a Superdex peptide column (10 cm Â 30 cm, Pharmacia Biotech, NJ) with 50 mM PBS (pH 7), and a ¯ow rate of 0.5 ml/minute. 15N T1 and T1r relaxation data were acquired and analyzed (Tjandra et al., 1996). The rotational correlation time and diffusion anisotropy were determined by least-square minimization on the basis of the measured relaxation times and the orientations of the internuclear vectors in the NMR structure (Tjandra et al., 1996) and by analysis of the distribution of 15N T1/T1r values (Clore et al., 1998).
