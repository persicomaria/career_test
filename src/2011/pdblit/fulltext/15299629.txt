Abstract
The crystal structure of the purine-pyrimidine alternating octameric RNA helix, r(GUAUAUA)d(C), carrying a 3'-terminal deoxycytidine residue, has been determined at 2.2/~ resolution. The molecule crystallizes in the rhombohedral space group.R3 (hexagonal cell constants: a -- b - 43.07,c -- 59.36 A;ot -- fl = 90,y -- 120~)with one duplex in an asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined with 83 and 2/3 solvent molecules and 2/3 sodium ions to a final R factor of 15.6% using 1775 reflections (86%). The duplexes are approximately linear, their global helix axes are inclined by 10° with respect to the 32-screw axes, and they are stacked on top of each other in a head-to-tail fashion. The twist between the junction base pairs of the stacked duplexes is negligible resulting in a discontinuity of the helix backbones and grooves. The sodium ions on the threefold axis play a significant role in the organization of the packing network. The helical parameters, particularly the twist and the roll, of this alternating sequence are in accord with Calladine's rules. Almost all the T-hydroxyl groups are involved in specific hydrogen-bonding interactions, either directly to the sugar ring oxygens 04' on the 3' side, or, through water bridges, to the sugars, phosphates, or bases. This hydrogen bonding of the U-hydroxyl groups restrains the conformation of the sugar-phosphate backbone and the glycosidic torsion angles of this RNA fragment. The lack of intermolecular packing contacts in the grooves provides a clear picture of the groove solvation.

Only recently problems with automated RNA synthesis and product purification have been overcome which is expected to increase the number of RNA crystal structures in the same fashion as DNA (Wahl & Sundaralingam, 1995). Although several RNA duplex crystal structures are available (Dock-Bregeon et al., 1988, 1989; Holbrook, Cheong, Tinoco & Kim, 1991; Leonard et al., 1994; Betzel et al., 1994; Cruse et al., 1994; Portmann, Usman & Egli, 1995; Schindelin et al., 1995; Baeyens, De Bondt & Holbrook, 1995), only one of them (Dock-Bregeon et al., 1988, 1989) exhibits a long stretch of alternating sequence. The current octamer structure, r(GUAUAUA)d(C), is completely alternating, but the packing scheme is very different from the above.

2. Experimental
2.1. Oligonucleotide synthesis and purification
The oligonucleotide was synthesized by thc solidphase phosphoramidite protocol on an ABI nucleic acid synthesizer (Model 391). After cleavage from the synthesis column, using 3:1 ammonium hydroxide/ethanol, and deprotection of the bases in an overnight incubation at 328 K, the material was lyophilized and the 2'-hydroxyl groups deprotected at room temperature in 2 M tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF (100 lal base -t, 24 h). The sample was further purified by reverse-phase FPLC, employing a step gradient from 0 to 30% acetonitrile, and a subsequent ethanol precipitation. Aldrich chemicals were used without further purification. Residues for the duplex are numbered 1-8 in strand 1 and 9-16 in strand 2 in the 5'-to-3 ~ direction.

1. Introduction
There is tremendous interest in the principles which govern tertiary RNA structure to improve our understanding and modeling capabilities of large RNA folds (Michel & Westhof, 1990). Since the initial investigations on the tRNA structure (for a review see e.g. Sundaralingam, 1979), there was a pause in the elucidation of the tertiary structure of RNA, until the determination of the structures of the tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complexes (Rould, Perona, $611 & Steitz, 1989; Ruff et

Refinement statistics using reflections in the 8--4 A range with intensities of at least 30 (303 reflections). A solution was obtained with an R factor of 48%. At this point a rigid-body refinement was performed, gradualloy increasing the resolution in three steps to 10-2.4 A, followed by a positional least-squares refinement to an R factor of 36%. Visual inspection with the program FRODO (Jones, 1985) of the model in 2Fo-Fc and F o - F , . difference maps confirmed the correctness of the solution. The A's and U's at the ends of the duplex were replaced by G's and dC's, respectively. One round of simulated annealing followed by further positional and temperature-factor refinement dropped the R factor to 22.3%. Placement of 46 water molecules, represented by O atoms, produced an R factor of 18.0%. Manual fitting in FRODO using difference and difference omitmaps followed by a positional and temperature-factor refinement yielded an R factor of 17.8% for 1481 reflections. Upon inspection of the molecular geometry with the program NUPARM (Battacharyya & Bansal, 1990), three a and 7 backbone bonds were found in the trans configuration. These were switched to the more preferred gauche-/gauche ÷ form and the structure again refined. The transltrans configurations appeared again and were therefore maintained. Subsequently, all data above 20" up to 2.2/~ resolution were incorporated into the refinement and an additional 41 water molecules were located, giving a total of 87 water molecules which were confirmed in F o - Fc difference omit maps. Water B values were restricted to approximately three times the average phosphate group B value. Waters which refined with higher B values were removed from the structure. Four water molecules refined directly on the threefold axis. Upon inspection, one of these had an octahedral coordination with coordination distances ranging from 2.34 to 2.42/~ and a very low B value (4/~2) indicating that it could be a metal ion instead of water. Sodium and cobalt were present in the crystallization and we tried both. Sodium was selected because it was consistent with the complete lack of color of the crystals and the peak heights and coordination distances in the difference Fourier maps. A second site on the threefold axis had a tetrahedral coordination with coordination distances around 2.4/~ and a low B value (2 ,~2) and was, after a similar examination, also considered a sodium ion. The B values did not change significantly upon replacement of the O atoms with sodium ions. The coordination distances of the presumed metal ions were not restrained during the refinement because a reasonable geometry was maintained. The other two water molecules on the threefold axis were kept as O atoms because they were coordinated to one and three neighbors, respectively, at distances of around 2.8 ,~,. The four residues on the threefold axis were given 1/3 occupancy and all other atoms were refined with full occupancy.

2.2. Crystallization and data collection Crystals were grown by hanging-drop vapor diffusion from a solution which initially contained 2 ktl oligonucleotide (2 mM double-stranded concentration), 0.5mL cobaltic hexamine trichloride (6mM), 1.6t.tl sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0, 100 mM), 5 l,tl water, and 1 l.tl MPD. By equilibration against l ml of 60% MPD, crystals formed in about one week and continued to grow for another week. A crystal measuring 0.6 x 0.2 × 0.2 mm was used in the data collection at 295 K. No crystal decay was observed after several days in the X-ray beam. Data up to 2.2 ,A, resolution were collected with two ~ (180 °) and one oJ (70 °) scans (0.25 ° frame -l) on our in-house four-circle Siemens goniostat equipped with a multiwire area detector and a Macscience rotating anode, generating ographite-monochromated Cu Kc~ radiation ( A - 1.5418A) at 4 0 k V and 100mA. The crystalto-detector distance was 12.0cm. There were 1775 data above 20 between 10 and 2.2 ,A,, constituting 86% of the theoretical value. Indexing of the reflections in the rhombohedral space group R3 with unit-cell dimensions a = b = c = 31.78 ]k, ~ = 3 = 7 = 85 .330 yielded an Rsym of 1.71%. The rhombohedral cell was transformed to a hexagonal cell for the structure solution and refinement (Table 1). An asymmetric unit contained one RNA duplex.

2.3. Structure solution and refinement The structure of the oligonucleotide was solved by molecular replacement and refined using the program package X-PLOR 3.0 (Brtinger, 1988). The central octamer sequence r(AU)4, consisting of nucleotides ( A 3 - U 10).(A 19-U26) of r[U(UA)rA] (Dock-Bregeon et al., 1989), was the model in a rotation-translation search

The R value when all 83 2/3 solvent molecules and 2/3 sodium ions were omitted was 20.7%. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The atomic coordinates have been deposited.*

3.1. Asymmetry in the molecular structure
The chimera, r(GUAUAUA)d(C), containing RNA residues throughout except for the 3'-terminal dC residue, crystallizes as a right-handed A-form double helix. The two independent strands in the duplex are conformationally different (r.m.s. deviation 0.8 ~) and are related by an approximate twofold axis (178.3 ° rotation, 0.07 ~ translation). The differences in the two strands arise from differences in the conformation of the deoxyriboses 8 and 16 (sugar pucker), and the trans/trans ~e/'y backbone bonds of residues A3 and A7 on strand 1 which are complemented by U I4 and U10 on strand 2, respectively, having the gauche-/gauche ÷ backbone. The duplex is compressed and deviates from the average fiber model for A-RNA (r.m.s. deviation 0.9~). The octamer helix is slightly bent at two positions, as revealed by analysis with the CURVES algorithm (Lavery & Sklenar, 1988). A 6 ° bend is seen between residues U2 and A3, and a 15° bend between residues U6 and A7, both of which are directed towards the deep (major) groove. The bending may result from the backbone assuming the extended conformation about ~e/'y (trans/trans) in one strand but not in the other. 3.2. Conformational parameters duplex

positive or negative values for ApU steps (average 3.6°). The average propeller twist is -17.8 (3.4) ° the inclination is 13.0(9.1) °. A's seem to be associated with slightly smaller X values (-157.9 °) than U's (-155.5 °) although this dependence is not very clear-cut. Excluding the terminal base pairs, the lowest values for the glycosidic torsions are correlated with the trans/trans (A3 and A7) and high gauche-/gauche + (A13) conformations of backbone torsion angles ~ and "y. Stacking interactions are very similar for analogous steps in the duplex. Partial interstrand stacking of purines at UpA steps is observed while ApU steps exhibit pure intrastrand stacking. The stacking pattern of the UpA steps is prone to clashes in the shallow groove due to the base-pair propeller twist. Such clashes can be avoided through alternating rolls and twists (Calladine's rules), which is actually observed. The helical parameters twist, roll, inclination, and x displacement oscillate throughout because of the alternating base sequence (Fig. 1). Alternation of the propeller twist and the rise is interrupted at the center of the sequence, the two halves of the molecule exhibiting the same trend, while the tilt values for the two halves are out-of-phase. Although the sequence is selfcomplementary, the alternation in the top half of the duplex is bigger than in the bottom half (Fig. 1).

The conformational parameters, calculated with the program NUPARM (Battacharyya & Bansal, 1990; Fig. 1) place the molecule into the A-form family where the major groove is deep and narrow (width 5.5 ]k), while the minor groove is wide and shallow (average width 10.4 ]k). The duplex has an average of 10.6 residues per turn, 34.0(1.6) ° twist and 2.8 (0.4)/~ rise. All ribose rings are in the northern hemisphere (N-type) of the pseudorotation cycle (C3'-endo). However, one of the terminal deoxyriboses, dCl6, displays C3'-exo sugar puckering (S-type) while the other, dC8, adopts the C3'endo (N-type) pucker. When dCl6 is manually forced into a C3'-endo conformation the R factor rises by 0.2% and after several cycles of refinement the sugar reverts to C3'-exo. The average intrastrand phosphate-phosphate distance is 5.84 ]k. Roll angles alternate between large positive values for UpA steps (average 13.3 °) and small

Fig. 1. Some of the conformational parameters determined for the current chimera show alternation between high and low values, which could reflect the alternation of purines and pyrirnidines in the sequence. Particularly the twist, the roll, the inclination, and the x displacement show clear alternation. Also in the propeller twist and the rise some oscillation between high and low values is visible. The tilt alternates out-of-phase in the two molecular halves. The torsion angles around the glycosidic bonds show no clear dependence on the nature of the associated base. If alternating structural properties are associated with certain sequences it is conceivable that these could be recognized by ligand molecules.

PURINE-PYRIMIDINE ALTERNATING RNA DOUBLE HELIX r(GUAUAUA)d(C) atoms of U's, and N3 atoms of A's. Unlike in A-tract B-DNA, which usually carries a single string of water molecules in the minor groove, the shallow groove here is flat and wide and easily accommodates short stretches of a double spine and more complicated networks of waters. At the backbone, single waters bridge some of the consecutive O1P phosphate O atoms but there is no continuous chain of such solvent molecules (not shown). 3.4. Solvation of the 2t-hydroxyl groups 2~-hydroxyl groups make direct or water-mediated intraduplex contacts to various parts of the nucleotide residues, i.e. to the bases, phosphate groups, and ribose

3.3. Solvent structure The duplex appears to be uniformly enveloped with solvent molecules. Of the 85 solvent molecules, 31 are in the deep groove, 24 in the shallow groove, and the remainder on the backbone and in the second hydration sphere. In the deep groove (Fig. 2a) waters form a continuous solvent column throughout the stacked duplexes, being anchored to the N7 atoms of purines, 0 4 of U's, and N4 of dC's without adopting an obvious pattern or network. In the shallow groove the water molecules form a discontinuous multiple spine (Fig. 2b). The waters mainly attach to the sugar ring 0 4 ~, the exocyclic 0 2 ~ sugar O atoms, the exocyclic N2 atoms of G's, 0 2

sugars. Contacts are both of the intranucleotide and internucleotide types. 11 of the 14 T-hydroxyl groups are hydrated. Three of them, G l, A7 and U 12, are involved in direct lattice interactions. In addition, these three U-hydroxyl groups and the U-hydroxyl group of A11 use water molecules or sodium ions to achieve indirect lattice contacts. The T-hydroxyl groups of residues A3 and U I2 carry single hydrogen-bonded waters which make no further contacts. A 2'-hydroxyl is hydrogen-bonded directly to the 0 4 ' atom of the following 3' residue four times and twice to the 0 5 ~ atom of the 3'-side residue. These types of interactions both occur between residues 15 and 16 and are lost when dC16 assumes the C3'-endo conformation. There are two examples in which an 0 2 ' is connected

via water molecules to the 04' atom of the following residue. In one case the 0 2 ' and 04' atoms on the same residue are linked through a water. Water-bridged 0 2 ' - 0 3 ' atoms are not frequent, but a unique feature of this structure is the hydrogen bonding of 0 2 ' and 0 3 ' of A7 to the exocyclic amino group of a symmetry-related

Interestingly, some of the interactions which were previously seen with one bridging water, are mediated by two water molecules here. Among the T-hydroxyl group-base interactions, a two-water bridge between the U-hydroxyl and the 0 2 of the corresponding uracil appears particularly frequently (four times, Fig. 3a). Several other two-water-bridged patterns are seen: a double-water bridge between OU and N3 of residue

Onewater analogs of the bridges shown in (a)-(c) are known and the insertion of an additional water does not seem to change any of the nucleolide conformational parameters by a large measure. From the figures it is obvious that the 2t-hydroxyl groups are important handles in RNA, involved in long-range contacts to various parts of the double helix. The bridging of 2t-hydroxyl groups across the shallow groove by two water molecules as in O) accounts r for the stretches of doublespine hydration seen in the shallow groove.

These connections give the impression of a multiple spine of hydration in the shallow groove. There are other interstrand interactions across the shallow groove, e.g. between N3 of A ' s and the 2'-hydroxyl groups (Fig. 3g).

A portion of the electron density showing the two-water bridge between 0 2 of U 10 and its 2~-hydroxyl group is shown in Fig. 4.

Early fiber-diffraction studies have demonstrated that the conformation of DNA is highly dependent on the humidity of the environment (see e.g. Saenger, 1984). The solvation patterns of nucleic acids have been studied previously (Westhof, 1988; Schneider et al., 1993). Interestingly, although the two halves of r ( G U A U A U A ) d ( C ) have identical sequence, the solvent structure is quite different (Fig. 5). It is possible that this asymmetry may transiently exist in solution and is trapped in the crystal lattice. The solvation can, in part, explain the observed variations in conformation. The exocyclic O atoms of pyrimidine residues are linked via water molecules to exocyclic O atoms of pyrimidines in the opposite strand. This interaction is observed in three of the four possible cases and stabilizes the propeller

Fig. 5. Stereoviews of the superposition of the two molecular halves including the waters. Although the sequences of the two half-molecules are identical, no common hydration patterns are observed in either (a) the deep groove or (b) the shallow groove. Differential hydration may have an influence on the different conformations found in the two halves of the duplex or the two strands, or could be the result of different packing forces.

M. C. WAHL et al. twist and possibly the roll angle. In the deep groove, the 0 6 of the terminal G's are in direct hydrogen-bonding contact with the exocyclic amino groups of A's in the complementary strand, further reinforcing the observed propeller twist. In addition, there is a water-mediated interaction between 0 4 of U6 and 0 4 of U I0 which nicely complements the bridging of the 02 atoms of U6 (with 0 2 of UI2) and U10 (with 02 of dC8) in the shallow groove. Analogous hydration patterns for the bases have been observed in alternating A-DNA structures (Kennard et al., 1986). Because of the Aconformation of the duplex, the U-hydroxyl groups point into the shallow groove and are instrumental in organizing the water structure. The intra- and interstrand water involving the U-hydroxyl groups can be expected to lend additional rigidity to the RNA helix compared with A-DNA. 3.6. Co'stal packing - the role o f water and sodium ions A deoxy residue was chosen for the 3' end of the oligomer because we thought that the duplex might crystallize in a pattern analogous to octamer A-DNA's with the terminal base pair of one duplex stacking on the flat shallow groove of a symmetry-related molecule (Shakked et al., 1983; Jain & Sundaralingam, 1989). Although such a stacking pattern has been observed for RNA (Dock-Bregeon et al., 1988), there is the possibility that the T-hydroxyl group of the 3'-terminal residue could interfere with the packing. However, the packing scheme for the present octamer turned out to be quite different from what we had expected and the duplexes were stacked on top of each other. So far we have not obtained diffraction-quality crystals of the alI-RNA analog. We have no explanation as to why crystals are obtained only when the terminal residue is d(C) but not r(C). Preparation and crystallization procedures were exactly the same for the two molecules. Each duplex is surrounded by three threefold axes and three 31-screw axes (Fig. 6a) so that the central duplex is surrounded by six neighboring duplexes. Corresponding to the three threefold axes, a duplex laterally faces three different crystal environments. These three lateral regions can be clearly seen for any pair of stacks of three duplexes (Fig. 6b). Direct and water-mediated contacts are observed only in two of the three regions (contact regions 1 and 2; Fig. 7). Many of these interactions involve U-hydroxyl groups. In contact region 1 (Fig. 7a) the duplexes interact with each other through the backbone of one duplex and a short stretch of the shallow groove of the other. In the upper part of contact region 1, 02' of A7 hydrogen bonds to both N2 of G1 ~ and 02 of U2 ~ (s denotes the symmetry-related duplex). In the lower part, 0 2 ' of U12 contacts O2P of A3 ~. In addition, waters mediate contacts between N3 of A11 and 0 2 ' of U2 ~, 02 of U6 and 03 ~ of U2 ~, and O2P of U12 and O2P of U4 ~. In contact region 2 (Fig. 7b), 0 3 ' of dCl& is hydrogen bonded to both 03 ~ of U I4 and O2P of A I5. Waters

As seen from the neighborhood of the duplex situated in the lower right corner of the unit cell in (a), lhere are six nearest neighbors to each duplex related by three threefold axes (two into the negative a direction, two apwoximately into the negative b direction and two in the positive a direction with respec! to the reference duplex). The three groups of lateral nearest neighbors account for three different close-approach areas around each helix as shown in (17). Only in two of the groups we observe direct and water-mediated contacts. The duplexes themselves are positioned on 32-screw axes which accounts for their head-to-tail pseudocontinuous stacking along the c direction (b). Because the helix axes are slightly inclined with respect to the c axis, the screw symbols do not appear centered in the deep groove (a).

The hydrated sodium II is connected to the 2'-hydroxyl of U10 through waters 21 and 60 (2.8/~,). Further along the axis, water 101 is associated with water 58 and its equivalents (Fig. 9c). Water 58 is connected to water 21 and 0 2 of dC8 which completes the connectivity. Water 101 would have to be disordered to engage in three identical contacts. The 2 ~hydroxyl groups, which are RNA specific, are intimately involved in the hydrogen-bonding network. 3.7. Helical junction and duplex stacking There are clear discontinuities across the gaps between the stacked helices. The helical twist and the rise across the gap are ,~1 ° and 2 A, respectively. Pseudointerstrand purine ring stacking is emphasized at the junction instead of pseudo-intrastrand purine/pyrimidine stacking. The stacking is reminiscent of the O # sugarring O atoms of the guanines on top of the deoxycytosine bases as observed in crystal structures of nucleotide building blocks (Bugg, Thomas, Sundaralingam & Rao, 1971). Similar stacking behavior is found for the dC

connect O2' and O3' of A5 to O3' of A3 ~ and O2P of U4 ~, respectively. In both these cases the water bridges are weak with water distances of ,~3.8/~ to one of the contact partners. RNA helices may be arranged in this fashion in large RNA molecules. The U-hydroxyl groups may be instrumental in this packing scheme. The global helix axis of the octamer duplex is inclined by ,~10 ° with respect to the 3e-screw axis of the crystal. The screw axis relates molecules which are stacked on top of each other in a head-to-tail fashion (Figs. 6b and 8). Interestingly, the approximate 11-fold helix of the RNA is almost perfectly superimposed on the crystallographic 3z-screw axis. The helical twist is such that the octamer repeats approximately every 238 °, fortuitously matching closely the 240 ° repeat of the 32-screw. Two water molecules (100 and 101) and two sodium ions on the threefold axis make direct or watermediated contacts to the three residues, dC8, U10, and A11. Waters 20, 21, 58, 60 and 75 together with their symmetry-related equivalents are involved in an elaborate hydrogen-bonding network, which can be grouped into three layers centered around sodium I, sodium II and water 101, respectively (Fig. 9). Sodium I is tetrahedrally coordinated (2.4-2.5/~) by the 2'-

The large purine rings maximize their interactions while the pyrimidine rings stack above the sugar rings of a symmetryrelated molecule.

The stacking is different to the stacking between terminal base pairs in r ( C G C G A A U U A G C G ) (Fig. 10; Leonard et al., 1994) where pseudo-intrastrand stacking is observed. R N A can, therefore, modulate the coaxial stacking through the chemical identity of the helix termini and/or the interactions in distal parts of the duplexes, which may be exploited in coaxially stacked helices in large R N A molecules. Although the groove widths in short oligonucleotides can be measured at only a small number of points (in octamers, e.g., only one measurement of the deep groove is possible), grooves formed between two stacked

663

duplexes can be evaluated. In the current structure both grooves are contracted between duplexes (Figs. 8 and 11). Four motions of the stacked duplexes relative to each other may influence the width of the grooves across the junction: the rise and the twist across the gap, and sliding and inclination of the two helices with respect to each other. In the current example, the sliding of the duplexes across one another in order to allow the purine-purine interstrand stacking, the decreased rise across the junction, and the inclination of the helix axes lead to the observed groove contraction across the gap. In order to satisfy the preference of the purine rings to efficiently stack upon each other across the junction, a small twist angle, as observed, may be favored.

4. Discussion
4.1. Alternating RNA structures Alternating structural parameters, as observed in the current octamer, could be exploited by ligand molecules, such as proteins, which could also modulate the alternation upon binding. In the RNA duplex, r[U(UA)6A], having a long stretch of alternating base sequence determined at a similar resolution (Dock-Bregeon et al., 1989), alternation of the roll angles was also observed, while alternation in other helical parameters was lacking, possibly due to the use of an analysis program which employed a linear global helix axis. This is consistent with the theoretical models of Sprner and Kypr (Sprner & Kypr, 1991) who predicted that Calladine-type clashes in the minor groove at pyrimidine-purine steps can be avoided by a positive roll. Although the predicted clashes are less severe for UpA steps than for CpG steps, due to the lack of the guanine 2-amino group, the sequences are still observed to have clear roll alternation.

4.2. Hydration of RNA at A. U base pairs The present crystal structure and that of r[U(UA)6A] (Dock-Bregeon et al., 1989) contain extended stretches of A.U base pairs. Analysis of the two structures reveals some common hydration motifs for the A.U base pairs, starting to outline a consensus hydration pattern. The tendency to link the base through one or two water molecules to the U-hydroxyl group seems to be more pronounced for U's than for A's, 0 2 of U's being, in general, more often hydrated than N3~s of A. The number of waters does not significantly influence the glycosyl X angle or the sugar pucker, the two parameters which could most influence the distance between the U-hydroxyl group and the base hetero atom. In some instances the bases are bridged in the shallow groove between 0 2 of U and N3 of A by a water molecule but more commonly the two atoms are separately hydrated with no hydrogen bond between the water molecules.

Fig. 10. Stacking of the terminal base pairs in (a) the current structure and (b) in the crystal structure of r(CGCGAAUUCAGCG)(Leonard et al., 1994) in which the sequence alternation is changed from 5'-C-3'-G to 5'-G-3'-C. The stacking behavior is analogous to the alternating steps within the continuous duplex. (c) and (d) show the pseudocontinuous stacking of the pseudouridine stem on the amino-acid acceptor stem of tRNAA~pand tRNAPhe, respectively. Because of the change of the sequence the deep groove widths are different by almost 2 A.

M. C. WAHL et al. it was found that G.C pairs in RNA often contain a string of three water molecules in the shallow groove connecting the 2'-hydroxyl groups and hydrating each shallow groove-exposed hetero atom of the bases. Such a string of waters may be interrupted in A.U pairs because of the lack of an exocyclic substituent at the C2 position of A. In the deep groove the N7 atoms of A's are almost always hydrated but the water molecule does not seem to make further contacts. In some cases a single water molecule bridges U (04) and A (N6) in analogy to that found in the G C pairs (Wahl, Rao & Sundaralingam, 1996). Comparison of the three UpA steps in the present structure and the six UpA steps in r[U(UA)6A] shows that the consensus hydration is restricted to the base pair and reveals no new features and bridges for the step. The observed hydration pattern involving the 2'-hydroxyl groups probably reinforces the A-form conformation of the duplexes. 4.3. Helix asymmetry Although the two halves of the current duplex have an identical base sequence, they are hydrated differently.

There is no extended common hydration network in the two halves in either groove. The asymmetry of the hydration is matched by the asymmetry of the structural parameters (different degree and phase of alternation). It is possible that the differential hydration is to some degree due to the crystal packing because the duplex does not face the same crystal environment in each direction. The water molecules that mediate the interactions between the helices could lead to an increased flexibility of their conformation and of their geometrical arrangement. A similar asymmetry in the hydration and the geometry can be seen in the structure of the self-complementary sequence r[U(UAh~A]. However, the duplexes in the r[U(UA)~,A] structure pack in the common A-DNA fashion with the terminal base pair of one contacting the shallow groove of a symmetryrelated molecule. This type of crystal packing, with extensive contacts in the grooves, is likely to locally perturb the RNA structure and be the source of the structural asymmetry of the two molecular halves. 4.4. Helix stacking Long continuous helices are seldom encountered in naturally occurring RNA's. Short helical stretches, however, can stack pseudocontinuously on top of each other; e.g. stacking of helices is known as an organizing motif in tRNA's. It was also observed in the recent structures of the hammerhead ribozymes (Pley, Flaherty & McKay, 1994; Scott, Finch & Klug, 1995). In addition, Cech's group introduced a general method to test for coaxially stacked helices and identified them in the catalytic core of the tetrahymena ribozyme (Murphy, Wang, Griffith & Cech, 1994). In almost all of the published RNA crystal structures, duplexes in the crystal lattice stack on top of each other forming pseudo-infinite helices. Again in the current example, helix stacking seems to be a major organizing theme in the crystal, particularly in light of the lack of extensive inter-duplex hydrogenbonding interactions. The frequency of its occurrence, pointing to the effectiveness of this type of interaction, matches the high degree of ordering achieved when helices stack in an RNA molecule. Helical stacking, therefore, should be a guiding motif in attempts to predict RNA tertiary structure. From the comparison of the current octamer to the non-alternating structure of r(CGCGAAUUAGCG) (Leonard et al., 1994) it is obvious that the pseudocontinuous stacking of the terminal base pairs is analogous to the stacking behavior of base pairs within the continuous duplexes, with 5'pyrimidine-3~-purine steps showing extensive interstrand stacking and 5'-purine-3'-pyrimidine steps exhibiting exclusive intrastrand stacking (Fig. 10). 4.5. Groove accessibility Although the deep groove of A-form RNA contains a larger number of potential hydrogen donor and ac-

Sequence Fig. I1. Across the stacking junction, where bridging phosphate groups are missing, the widths of the grooves formed by two stacked duplexes can be determined. The groove widths were measured as the closest cross-strand P - - P distance (minus 5.8 ,~ tot two phosphate van der Waals radii) across the respective groove. Distances measured between phosphates of the same duplex are shown as solid circles and distances measured between phosphates of two different duplexes as open circles. While the shallow groove is mainly made up of residues from the same duplex the deep groove is mainly formed by residues from different duplexes. Both grooves are contracted when extended into a coaxially stacked molecules. The geometry of the stacking junction determines this modulation of the groove widths for stacked helices.

ceptor atoms than the shallow groove, which could be used for specific interactions with ligands, it is rather narrow and, therefore, inaccessible. Weeks and Crothers demonstrated with chemical acylation experiments that structural perturbations, afforded e.g. by internal loops, which lead to a loss of stacking enthalpy, can serve as efficient helix terminators and result in more accessible deep grooves, while coaxially stacked helices could efficiently maintain helix continuity and therefore inaccessibility of the deep groove (Weeks & Crothers, 1992). The latter notion is clearly confirmed by the current X-ray structure. However, comparison with other RNA duplex structures (Fig. 10) suggests that the stacking geometry can be modulated by the chemical nature of the terminal bases and/or by interactions in distal parts of the duplex. A similar situation may be found with coaxially stacked helices in natural RNA molecules which could lead to differentially accessible grooves. The coaxially stacked helices found in natural RNA's usually display one consecutive strand and a nick in the opposite strand, as opposed to the double-strand nicks seen between duplexes in crystals. In the crystal structures of tRNA Phe (Suddath et al., 1974; Robertus et al., 1974; Stout, Mizuno, Rao, Swaminathan & Sundaralingam, 1978) and tRNA g~p (Moras et al., 1980) the pseudouridine stem is stacked on the amino-acid acceptor stem. The base pairs involved are (U7/sMeC49).(G65-A66) in tRNA phe and (A7/SMec49).(G65-U66) in tRNA A~p. Although the consecutive strand may be expected to somewhat restrain the stacking interaction, the change from a nonalternating step (tRNA Phe) to a purine-pyrimidine alternating step (tRNA A~p) changes the deep groove width by about 2 ~, estimated from the phosphate-phosphate distances between residues 7 and 65 (Fig. 10). Such modulations in the groove widths may allow or deny access for ligands, such as proteins or the third strand in an RNA triplex.
