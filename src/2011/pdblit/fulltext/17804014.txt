Met467, the axial ligand to type I Cu in a multicopper oxidase, Myrothecium verrucaria bilirubin oxidase was substituted with a non-coordinating Phe and Leu to transform the spectral and magnetic properties and oxidase activities of the enzyme into those of fungal laccases, but the mutated type I Cu center showed properties characteristic of phytocyanins, blue copper proteins with an axial coordination of Gln, due to compensatory binding of the distal Asn459 as evidenced by a double mutation.

Keywords: Bilirubin oxidase Multicopper oxidase Type I Cu Laccase Blue copper protein Compensatory binding

Bilirubin is a metabolite of heme and its concentration in blood has been utilized for the diagnosis of liver disorders such as jaundice and liver diseases such as cirrhosis [1]. Detection of bilirubin has been performed non-enzymatically using diazo-compound or enzymatically using bilirubin oxidase from Myrothecium verrucaria (MvBO) [2]. MvBO is multicopper oxidase containing four Cu ions, a type I Cu, a type II Cu, and a pair of type III Cus [3,4]. The type I Cu mediates the transfer of an electron from the substrate to the trinuclear Cu center composed of the type II Cu and two type III Cus, where a dioxygen molecule is converted to two water molecules without releasing activated oxygen species. The type I Cu center in MvBO, as well as that in other multicopper oxidases, is coordinated by a set of amino acids, 1Cys2His1Met, while fungal laccases have a non-coordinating amino acid such as Phe and Leu in place of the axial Met, realizing high redox potentials (Supplementary Figure S1) [5]. MvBO has also received special attention as the benchmark for the cathodic catalyst in biofuel cells among multicopper oxidases such as CueO, laccase, and ascorbate oxidase [6­8]. We have constructed heterologous overexpression systems of MvBO using Aspergillus oryzae and Pichia pastoris as hosts, and performed kinetics studies of the recombinant enzyme and mutants, Cys457Ser and Met467Gln/Gly/His/Arg for the type I Cu center, His94Val for the type II Cu center, His456Val/His458Val and His134Val/His136Val for the type III Cu centers, and Asp105Glu/

Ala/Asn for a putative proton donor [9­13]. Met467Gln is the mutant, in which the type I Cu center is changed into that found in a class of blue copper proteins, phytocyanins [3,4], although this type of Cu center with a highly rhombic character and relatively low redox potential has not been found in multicopper oxidases. The activities of Met467Gln for oxidizing bilirubin and laccase substrates such as 2,20 -azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), p-phenylenediamine (p-PD), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol drastically decreased due to a shift in redox potential of ca. 0.2 V toward negative potential [9,10,13]. In the present study, we substituted Met467 with Phe and Leu to study the properties and reactions of the MvBO mutants containing the type I Cu center found in fungal laccases [3,4]. However, the spectral properties of the mutants suggested that a nearby Asn or Gln residue occupied a vacant coordination site of the type I Cu center. In order to ascertain and avoid this compensatory binding, we performed double mutations at Met467 and a putative compensatory ligand, Asn459. Materials and methods The gene fragments for preparing Met467Leu and Met467Phe were synthesized by PCR using oligonucleotide primers shown below together with the appropriate M13 primers and the template plasmid pBSBO containing the gene coding for MvBO [13]: M467L(+), 50 -ggatcacgatctgatggctgc-30 ; M467L(À), 50 -gcagccatc agatcgtgatcc-30 ; M467F(+), 50 -ggatcacgatttcatggctgc-30 ; M467F(À), 50 -gcagccatgaaatcgtgatcc-30 (the site of mutation is under-

lined). The PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes SnaI and NotI, and exchanged with the corresponding fragments of pBSBO to give pBSBO-M467L and pBSBO-M467F. After verification of the mutagenesis by DNA sequencing, mutated MvBO genes were treated with EcoRI and NotI and cloned into the expression plasmid pPIK9K (Invitrogen). To obtain the gene fragments for double mutants, Asn459Ala/Met467Leu, Asn459Ala/ Met467Phe, Asn459Val/Met467Leu, and Asn459Val/Met467Phe, the following primers were used with the M13 forward primer and pBSBO-M467F or pBSBO-M467L as a template: N459V(+), 50 -gt gtatacatgttccattgccacgttttgattcacgagg-30 ; N459A(+), 50 -gtgtataca tgttccattgccacgctttgattcacgagg-30 . The PCR products were treated as described above. The expression and purification of mutants were achieved as reported previously [13]. The purity of the mutants was checked by SDS­PAGE. Specific activities of the mutants for oxidizing laccase substrates and Fe(II) were determined from changes in absorption as reported previously [8­13]. Measurements of absorption, circular dichroism (CD), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and atomic absorption spectra were also performed as reported previously [8,9, and papers cited therein]. The redox potential of type I Cu was determined by cyclic voltammetry using a BAS CV-50W voltammetric analyzer with a three-electrode system containing an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a platinum plate counter electrode, and a 4,40 -dithiodipyridine-modified Au working electrode under an Ar atmosphere or in site measurements of the absorption spectra and potential of the partly reduced mutants using hexacyanoferrate(II/III) and octacyanotungstate(IV/V) as mediators. Three-dimensional models of MvBO were generated as reported previously [13]. Results and discussion According to the atomic absorption spectroscopy, Met467Phe and Met467Leu contained 3.7 and 2.2 Cu ions per protein molecule, respectively (experimental error, ca. 10%). Met467Phe exhibited a pale blue color when isolated, but the intensity increased after the reaction with a slight excess of hexacyanoferrate(III), indicating that Met467Phe was expressed in a mixed state including a partly reduced form unreactive with dioxygen. On the other hand, Met467Leu showed a more intense blue color than Met467Phe when isolated, but the intensity did not increase further in spite of the reaction with hexacyanoferrate(III). The reactions of Met467Leu with Cu(I) and Cu(II) under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively, did not lead to an increase in Cu content. Absorption spectra of Met467Phe reacted with hexacyanoferrate(III) (red line) and Met467Leu as isolated (blue line) are shown in Fig. 1A together with that of the recombinant enzyme (black line). The spectral features of Met467Phe and Met467Leu are similar except that the intensity of the band at 598 nm of the latter is

56% of that of the former. However, their spectral characteristics are apparently different from those of the recombinant enzyme in that a clear band coming from the charge transfer, His to the type I Cu, was observable at ca. 440 nm. In addition, the band coming from the d­d transitions of type I Cu shifted from 740 to ca. 850 nm in the mutants (Fig. 1A). All these spectral features derived from type I Cu in Met467Phe and Met467Leu are characteristic of phytocyanins, a class of blue copper proteins such as stellacyanin and mavicyanin, which have an axial coordination of Gln in place of Met [4] (Supplementary Figure S1). In addition, the spectral characteristics of Met467Phe/Leu as above are the same as those

Spectra of the recombinant MvBO, Met467Phe, Met467Leu, Asn459Ala/Met467Phe reoxidized with air after the reduction by dithionite, and Asn459Ala/Met467Phe reacted with hexacyanoferrate(III) are shown with black, red, blue, light green, and dark green lines, respectively. Absorption and CD spectra were measured at room temperature and the X-band EPR spectra, at 77 K with a microwave frequency of 9.2 GHz, microwave power of 4mW, modulation of 1.0 mT at 100 kHz, amplitude of 400­1000, sweep time of 4 min, and time constant of 0.03 s. EPR spectra were normalized to give analogous intensities. Only the hyperfine structure of the type I Cu signal is shown in each EPR spectrum expect for Asn459Ala/Met467Phe reoxidized with air after the reduction by dithionite, in which the type II Cu signal is dominant. The strong absorption of Met467Phe at around 400 nm in Fig. 1A is due to a slight excess of hexacyanoferrate(III). The weak EPR signal at 273 mT marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1C probably originates in the uncoupled type III Cu (MI = À3/2) [11]. The unit in ordinate, the molar circular dichroism, can be converted into mean residue ellipticity by multiplying 3298.

of the Met467Gln mutant of MvBO [9,10,13] and the Met150Gln mutant of the Cu-containing nitrite reductase from Achromobacter cycloclastes [14]. In contrast, fungal laccases having a non-coordinating Phe or Leu in place of Met exhibited spectral features analogous to those of the type I Cu center coordinated by Met as the fourth ligand. On the other hand, the absorption intensity at ca. 330 nm of both Met467Phe and Met467Leu originating in the charge transfer from the bridged OHÀ to type III Cu(II), was considerably lower than that of the recombinant enzyme (differing from other multicopper oxidases, the recombinant MvBO does not give a clear shoulder at 330 nm in spite of the strong absorption intensity) because the trinuclear Cu center was in the mixed state including the partly reduced form and the unbridged form between the type III Cus (vide infra). In the CD spectra of Met467Phe and Met467Leu (Fig. 1B), the 440 nm band was prominent and the d-d band shifted from 770 nm to longer wavelengths. CD spectral features of both Met467Phe and Met467Leu due to the charge transfer, Cys(SÀ)r to Cu(II), at around 530 nm were modified as observed in Met467Gln (the sign for the weak charge transfer band, Cys(SÀ)r to Cu(II), is reversed), while that due to the charge transfer, Cys(SÀ)p to Cu(II), at ca. 600 nm was not affected [9,13]. EPR spectra of Met467Phe and Met467Leu (Fig. 1C) also indicated that the structure of the type I Cu center changed. The type I Cu of the recombinant MvBO gives a signal with an axial symmetry: the spin Hamiltonian parameters are g|| = 2.21, g\ = 2.07, and A|| = 8.5 Â 10À3 cmÀ1 (black line). However, the type I Cu signal in Met467Phe (red line) exhibited a rhombic symmetry with spin Hamiltonian parameters of gz = 2.30, gy = 2.08, gx = 2.02, Az = 4.3 Â 10À3 cmÀ1, and Ax = 5.6 Â 10À3 cmÀ1, while the parameters of type II Cu, g|| = 2.24, g\ = 2.07, and A|| = 18 Â 10À3 cmÀ1, did not change. The highly rhombic nature of the type I Cu EPR signal is characteristic of phytocyanins, in which the amide oxygen in the side chain of a Gln residue coordinates with the type I (or blue) Cu center in place of the thioether sulfur of the Met residue. The total amount of the Cu(II) of Met467Phe detectable by EPR spectroscopy was 2.2 per protein molecule (Experimental error, ca. 10%). Type III Cu was in the mixed state including the antiferromagnetically coupled Cu(II) form (Cu(II)AOHACu(II)), the Cu(I) form, and the uncoupled type III Cu(II) form (Cu(II) Cu(II)) to give a signal at around 273 mT (multicopper oxidases sometimes give a MI = À3/2 signal originating in the uncoupled type III Cus [10], asterisk in Fig. 1C). Judging from the detection of the type II Cu EPR signal and the low intensities of 330 nm in the absorption and CD spectra (Fig. 1A­C), it appears that an appreciable proportion of type III Cus is in the reduced form. Differing from hemocyanin and tyrosinase containing only the type III Cu center [15], however, bilirubin oxidase cannot react with dioxygen, if the trinuclear Cu center is not fully reduced. Therefore, Met467Phe is kept in the mixed valence state when isolated. Met467Leu (blue line) gave a similar EPR spectrum to Met467Phe, although the feature at around 285 mT was slightly different because of the presence of an undefined minor component. The total amount of EPR-detectable Cu(II) including types I and II was 1.0 per protein molecule, indicating ca. 50% of Met467Leu to be in the apo-form. The absorption, CD, and EPR spectral features of Met467Phe/Leu suggest that an amide oxygen in the side chain of a Gln or Asn residue or a backbone amide group occupied an axial position of the coordination-unsaturated type I Cu center. According to the amino acid sequence alignment of multicopper oxidases (Supplementary Figure S1), Asn459 in MvBO is adjacent to the conserved His-CysHis sequence to connect the type I Cu center and the trinuclear Cu center: 454Met-Phe-His-Cys-His-Asn-Leu-Ile-His-Glu-Asp-HisAsp-Met-468Met. The crystal structure of MvBO (personal communication with Dr. Mizutani et al.) indicated that the amide oxygen in the side chain of the distal Asn459 approaches the type I Cu cen-

ter from ca. 5 Å to less than 4 Å, if the b-carbon atom rotates (Fig. 2 shows the three-dimensional models constructed using the crystal structure of laccases and CotA as a template [16­18]). This does not take place in other multicopper oxidases, since non-coordinating amino acid residues such as Ile, Leu Val, and Phe are located in the corresponding position (Supplementary Figure S1). An analogous mutation has been performed for CotA, but Ile did not induce compensatory coordination, while the mutant was unstable and did not fully incorporate Cu ions at the active sites [18]. In order to prove this possible compensatory coordination of Asn459, we performed double mutations at Asn459 and Met467. Of the four mutants, Asn459Ala/Met467Phe, Asn459Ala/ Met467Leu, Asn459Val/Met467Phe, and Asn459Val/Met467Leu, only the first one incorporated 1.5 Cu ions in a protein molecule. The others were in the apo-form, although highly expressed. The Cu content of these double mutants did not increase in spite of reactions with Cu(II) and Cu(I) under aerobic and unaerobic conditions, respectively. Asn459Ala/Met467Phe was pale blue when expressed (not shown), but the intensity of the charge transfer band, Cys(SÀ)p to Cu(II), increased on reduction with a small amount of dithionite and subsequent oxidation with air (light green line in Fig. 1A), and increased further after a reaction with hexacyanoferrate(III) (dark green line, the absorption maximum wavelength shifted from 608 to 602 nm). Features of both absorption and CD spectra (Fig. 1A and B) were now analogous to those of the recombinant enzyme except in the CD spectrum at around 350 nm due to the dominating contributions at <320 nm: the d­d band appeared at ca. 740 nm and no prominent absorption was observed at ca. 440 nm. The EPR signal of type II Cu (g|| = 2.24, g\ = 2.07, and A|| = 18 Â 10À3 cmÀ1) was conspicuous before the reaction with hexacyanoferrate(III) because type I Cu was partly in the reduced state when isolated (light green line in Fig. 1C). However, the type I Cu EPR signal with an axial symmetry (g|| = 2.20, g\ = 2.07, and A|| = 8.7 Â 10À3 cmÀ1) became noticeable after the reaction with hexacyanoferrate(III), although the parameters were different from those in MvBO. The total amount of EPR-detectable Cu(II) was 0.8 per protein molecule, being consistent with the total Cu content of 1.5 per protein molecule and the lowered absorption intensity, ca. 44% of that of the recombinant enzyme). The incorporation of less Cu has also been reported for other multicopper oxidase mutants [9,10,12,18,19]. Oxidase activities of Asn459Ala/Met467Phe for bilirubin, ABTS, p-PD, and Fe(II) ion were prominently reduced to less than ca. 1% of those of the recombinant MvBO. Nevertheless, the reduction of Asn459Ala/Met467Phe with dithionite and the subsequent oxidation with air could occur, indicating that Asn459Ala/Met467Phe was a mixture of holo- and apoproteins (ratio of two to three).

By following the slow oxidation of the reduced double mutant with air, the redox potential of type I Cu was determined as 0.60 V (n = 1.0) (Supplementary Figure S2), slightly lower than that of the recombinant enzyme, 0.62 V (The reported redox potential of MvBO ranges from 0.49 to 0.67 V, showing different reduction and oxidation curves [19,20]). On the other hand, the redox potential of Met459Phe and Met467Leu was determined as 0.42 and 0.38 V, respectively, by cyclic voltammetry (Supplementary Figure S3), consistent with that of Met467Gln, 0.43 V [6,13]. Therefore, the prominent reduction in the oxidizing activities of Asn459Ala/Met467Phe for various substrates (Table 1) is not ascribable to a change in the redox potential of type I Cu. On similar mutations of a multicopper oxidase, CotA [18], and a blue copper protein, rusticyanin [21], there was a shift toward a positive potential by 0.09 and 0.06 V, respectively. The slight shift toward a negative potential might have been derived from an increase in local polarity around the type I Cu center due to a loosening of the molecular packing, although the CD spectrum in the region, 190­250 nm, did not change after the double mutation (not shown). Otherwise, the binding of Asn459 adjacent to one of the type III Cu ligands, His458, might have significantly affected the dioxygen-binding or -reducing ability of the trinuclear Cu center. The compensatory binding of a nearby Met (Met62) has been reported for the Met150Gly mutant of nitrite reductase containing type I Cu and type II Cu [22]. At the very early stages of our study on MvBO, we prepared Met467Gly together with a variety of mutants as potential Cu ligands [9,10]. The substitution of Met467 with Gly had induced spectral changes and prominent reductions of the oxidizing activities for laccase substrates similarly to Met467Phe/Leu, although we then did not notice the possible compensatory binding of Asn459 because of poor information about the protein structure of MvBO. The present results strongly suggest that the distal Asn459 occupied an axial position of the coordination-unsaturated type I Cu center in the MvBO mutants. Therefore, one has to note the presence of an amino acid residue functioning as a compensatory ligand when performing mutations in the ligand for a metal center.
