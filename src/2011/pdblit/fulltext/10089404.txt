High-resolution structures of three new trypsin± squash-inhibitor complexes: a detailed comparison with other trypsins and their complexes
An anionic trypsin from Atlantic salmon and bovine trypsin have been complexed with the squash-seed inhibitors, CMTI±I (Cucurbita maxima trypsin inhibitor I, P1 Arg) and CPTI±II (Cucurbita pepo trypsin inhibitor II, P1 Lys). The crystal structures of three such complexes have been determined to Ê 1.5±1.8 A resolution and re®ned to crystallographic R factors ranging from 17.6 to 19.3%. The two anionic salmon-trypsin complexes (ST±CPTI and ST±CMTI) and the bovine-trypsin complex (BT±CPTI) have been compared to other trypsin± inhibitor complexes by means of general structure and primary and secondary binding features. In all three new structures, the primary binding residue of the inhibitor binds to trypsin in the classical manner, but with small differences in the primary and secondary binding patterns. Lysine in CPTI± II binds deeper in the speci®city pocket of bovine trypsin than lysine in other known lysine±bovine-trypsin complexes, and anionic salmon trypsin lacks some of the secondary binding interactions found in the complexes formed between squash inhibitors and bovine trypsin. The ST±CMTI complex was formed from the reactive-site-cleaved form of the inhibitor. However, well de®ned electron density was observed for the P1ÐP1H peptide bond, together with a hydrogen-bonding pattern virtually identical to those of all serine-protease± protein-inhibitor complexes, indicating a resynthesis of the scissile bond.

1. Introduction
Proteolytic enzymes are found in organisms living in extremely cold to extremely warm environments. Among these, the serine proteinases are one of the most extensively studied groups of enzymes; they have been well characterized for both mammals and cold-adapted ®sh species. The gene coding for trypsin, a member of this family, is found in at least four different isoforms in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar): three anionic forms and one cationic form (Male et al., 1995; GenBank/EMBL codes SalTRP-I, SalTRP-IA, SalTRP-II and SalTRP-III). The anionic and cationic isoforms differ in both physical behaviour (Outzen et al., 1996) and three-dimensional structure (Schrùder et al., 1998). The anionic form follows the trend of other enzymes from cold-adapted species Á Á (e.g. Asgeirsson et al., 1989; Asgeirsson & Bjarnason, 1991; Kristjansson & Nielsen, 1992; Simpson & Haard, 1984; Osnes & Mohr, 1985; Gildberg & éverbù, 1990; Feller et al., 1994) where increased catalytic ef®ciency is at the expense of reduced temperature stability compared with the mammalian counterparts. The cationic form, on the other hand, resembles the mammalian trypsins in these respects. For a speci®c

substrate, the anionic ®sh enzyme is almost 40 times more ef®cient, measured by the kcat/KM ratio, than the mammalian counterparts (Outzen et al., 1996). KM (the Michaelis±Menten constant) is reduced by a factor of up to 20, while kcat (the catalytic rate constant) is about twice as high. Thus, the increased catalytic ef®ciency observed for anionic salmon trypsin is primarily due to a higher binding af®nity of the substrate. This suggests differences in the substrate-binding region; in this study the trypsin±squash-inhibitor complexes of both salmon and bovine trypsins serve as models for studying differences in substrate binding. A thorough comparison of Ê bovine and anionic salmon trypsins has been made by Smalas et al. (1994) and Heimstad et al. (1995), but the structural basis for the differences in physical behaviour are not yet fully understood. Of particular importance in the determination of the strength of association with trypsin is the P1 residue at position 5 [P1, P1H etc.; notation according to the nomenclature of Schechter & Berger (1967)], which forms almost half of all contacts with the enzyme (Bode et al., 1989). Truncation of this side chain to a Gly residue removes about 70% of the total association energy (O. Buczek, M. Dadlez & J. Otlewski, unpublished results). Interactions of basic side chains in the S1 binding pocket of trypsin thus form a `hot spot' of enzyme± inhibitor interaction and precise explanation of their structural accommodation seems crucial. The role of the P1 residue is further supported by free-energy calculations, which indicate that the P1 residue plays a dominant role in the binding energy of trypsin complexes (Krystek et al., 1993). In a more intensive study of the importance of the P1 residue in complex formation, we intend to use inhibitors with various P1 amino acids. In this paper, we describe the X-ray structures of three squash-inhibitor complexes with either Arg or Lys side chains at position P1. The squash inhibitors Cucurbita maxima trypsin inhibitor I (CMTI-I) and Cucurbita pepo trypsin inhibitor II (CPTI±II) are identical, except for two residues. The reactive-site P1 residue which extends into the speci®city pocket of trypsin is arginine in CMTI±I and lysine in CPTI±II, and residue 21 is exchanged from a valine in CMTI±I to an isoleucine in CPTI±II. The P1 arginine and P1 lysine side chains make favourable contacts inside the S1 pocket of trypsin. P1 Arg and P1 Lys squash inhibitors recognize bovine and anionic salmon trypsins with association constants in the 1011±1012 MÀ1 range. The two enzymes bind the squash inhibitor with P1 lysine with approximately similar association constants (about 8 Â 1011 MÀ1). The association constant is 3 and 6 times lower for binding the inhibitor with P1 arginine to bovine and salmon trypsins, respectively (Otlewski & Zbyryt, 1994; Otlewski, unpublished data). Structure determination and association-energy measurements for P1 side chains should provide detailed information about trypsin speci®city and, more generally, about the role of `hot spots' in the determination of the energy of protein±protein complexes. The present salmon- and bovine-trypsin complexes are compared with other trypsin complexes with squash inhibitors and the corresponding complex with the slightly larger (58 residues) bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI; Bode & Huber, 1992). Proteinase inhibitors from squash seeds form an uniform family of small proteins consisting of 27±33 aminoacid residues, cross-linked with three disul®de bridges (for reviews, see Otlewski, 1993; Otlewski & Krowarsch, 1996). Squash inhibitors are highly stable and rigid proteins. They inhibit a number of serine proteinases, including trypsin, plasmin, kallikrein, cathepsin G and blood-clotting factors Xa and XIIa (Otlewski et al., 1990). Squash inhibitors inhibit different serine proteinases via the standard mechanism of inhibition (Laskowski & Kato, 1980; Otlewski & Zbyryt, 1994). According to the mechanism, the inhibitors are substrates and their P1±P1H reactive-site peptide-bond residues can be cleaved by the cognate proteinase. An inhibitor with a cleaved reactive site forms the same stable complex with the enzyme as an inhibitor with the reactive site intact. Thus, complex formation from the cleaved inhibitor and proteinase comprises resynthesis of the reactive site. The character of the complex formed from the cleaved inhibitor, to the best of our knowledge, has never been structurally veri®ed.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Crystallization and data collection

Anionic salmon trypsin (ST) was complexed with the squash-seed inhibitors from Cucurbita maxima (CMTI±I) and the inhibitor from Cucurbita pepo (CPTI±II), and bovine trypsin (BT) was complexed with CPTI±II. For crystallization experiments, CMTI with a cleaved reactive site (P1ÐP1H peptide bond) was used, while the peptide bond was intact in CPTI. The reactive-site peptide-bond-hydrolyzed form of the inhibitor was prepared by a 48 h incubation of 70 mg of the inhibitor in 50 mM sodium formate and 20 mM CaCl2, pH 2.8, with 0.2 mg of bovine trypsin (Worthington Chemical Corp.) in a total volume of 3 ml at 295 K. Trypsin was subsequently removed by chromatography on a Bio-Gel P-10 column equilibrated with 50 mM formic acid pH 1.5. The inhibitor fraction was subsequently applied to a SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mM sodium formate pH 3.2. Intact and cleaved inhibitor were resolved by a linear gradient of NaCl (0±0.3 M). Finally, the cleaved inhibitor was desalted on a Biogel P-2 column in 50 mM formic acid pH 1.5 (Otlewski & Zbyryt, 1994). Anionic trypsin from salmon was puri®ed from pancreatic extract using af®nity ion-exchange and gel-®ltration chromatography (Outzen et al., 1996), while bovine trypsin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. The complexes between squash inhibitor and trypsin were formed by mixing the components in a 2:1 molar ratio, yielding a ®nal protein concentration of 20 mg mlÀ1. The complexes were crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Both salmon-trypsin complexes were crystallized from 1.0 M citrate buffer at pH 6.0±6.4 at 277 K. The BT±CPTI complex was crystallized as described by Bode et al. (1989). All crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, and there is one complex molecule in the asymmetric unit for all complexes. The salmon-trypsin crystals diffracted beyond

3. Results
3.1. General description

The orientation of the anionic ST±CMTI complex was determined by molecular replacement using X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992). The search model was the bovine--trypsin± CMTI complex (Protein Data Bank entry 1PPE; Bernstein et al., 1977; Bode et al., 1989), in which the bovine trypsin was replaced with the coordinates for anionic salmon trypsin Ê (Protein Data Bank entry 2TBS; Smalas & Hordvik, 1993). Re¯ections with F > 2'(F) were used throughout the molecular replacement. A real-space Patterson rotation search was Ê performed using data in the resolution range 15.0±4.0 A. One well separated solution 10' above average and 4' above the second highest peak was found at Eulerian angles 1 = 202.15, 2 = 66.95 and 3 = 61.09 . The rotated and translated model provided an R value of 42.0% in the resolution range 8.0± Ê 2.5 A.

The quality of all structures is, in general, good. The mean coordinate error estimated from a Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) Ê is about 0.1 A for all complexes, while the corresponding r.m.s. coordinate errors calculated by the ' A method suggested by Ê Ê Read (1986) are 0.20 A for the CMTI complex and 0.18 A for both CPTI complexes. The Ramachandran plots of 9,2 angles (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968) show that about 90% of the non-glycine residues fall within the most favourable regions of the plot for all structures. The remaining 10% lie within the additional allowed regions as de®ned in PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), except for one residue. As reported for both BT±CMTI (Bode et al., 1989) and PT± MCTI [complex between porcine trypsin and inhibitor from Momordica charantia seeds (Huang et al., 1992)], the È and É

values for inhibitor residue Ala18I are outside the allowed regions. The electron density is, in general, well de®ned for the trypsin part of all complexes. Regions where the density is weak are generally in loop regions exposed to solvent. The anionic salmon-trypsin main chain is well de®ned in both complexes, except for the three terminal residues at the Cterminus, a feature similar to that of the benzamidine-inhibÊ ited salmon trypsin (Smalas & Hordvik, 1993). Only the side chains of residues Tyr97 and Ser148 are completely missing in both salmon-trypsin complexes. In addition, the side chain of Arg62 is also completely missing in ST±CMTI. Residues 24 and 28 in anionic salmon trypsin were identi®ed as prolines (Fig. 1). These residues are alanines in previously solved structures of the ®sh trypsin. Although some trypsin side chains are poorly de®ned in BT±CPTI, all of them can be interpreted. The electron density of the inhibitors in the salmon-trypsin complexes is, in general, not as well de®ned as for the trypsin molecules or the inhibitor part of the mammalian-trypsin complex. The orientation of the main chain of Arg1I is not clear and residue Glu24I is completely missing in both salmon-trypsin complexes. Only the segment from Val2I to Leu7I, in contact with the enzyme, is fully de®ned in the two complexes. Regions of the salmon-trypsin complexes where the squash inhibitor has poor or missing electron density include the side chain of Arg1I, the loop from residus 9I to 13I, residue 19I and the loop from 23I to 27I. The inhibitor part of BT±CPTI is involved in several packing interactions with symmetry-related molecules, resulting in an electron density which is considerably better compared with those of the salmon-trypsin complexes. These interactions probably have a stabilizing effect on the loop 9I±13I in the bovine-trypsin complexes, and the presence of the Arg1I side chain in the bovine-trypsin complex stabilizes the 23I±27I loop. The three internal waters in the squash inhibitors reported by Bode et al. (1989) and Huang et al. (1993) are also found in the three new structures. Ê The re®ned average B factor of all atoms is about 22 A2 for both salmon-trypsin complexes (Table 1) and Ê 18.6 A2 for the BT±CPTI complex. All values correspond reasonably well with the Wilson B factor from scaling of the data sets.

Both maps clearly identify residues 24 and 28 as prolines. The coordinates of the ®nal re®ned model are superimposed on the simulatedannealing maps. The ®gure was produced using BOBSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991; Esnouf, 1997).

Ribbon-style diagram of the complex between salmon trypsin (red) and CPTI (blue). The P1 lysine residue of CPTI penetrating the active site of trypsin is indicated along with the structurally bound calcium ion (green) of trypsin.

The three new structures are compared to the structures formed between bovine trypsin and CMTI and porcine trypsin (PT) in complex with MCTI (inhibitor from Momordica charantia seeds) (for illustration, see Fig. 2). The complex formed between bovine trypsin and BPTI is added for comparison of lysine binding. In Table 2, all main-chain atoms of the trypsin part of the trypsin-inhibitor complexes are compared with the benzamidine-inhibited bovine (Bode & Schwager, 1975) and anionic Ê salmon (Smalas & Hordvik, 1993) trypsins. The inhibitor part of the complexes is compared to CPTI of the BT±CPTI complex. Differences between trypsins from different species are in the same range as those between other trypsin Ê structures (Smalas et al., 1994) and the mean differences between different crystal structures of the salmon or bovine trypsins (0.25 and Ê 0.34 A, respectively) are within the range expected from uncertainties in coordinate positions and effects from different packing environments. Regions that appear with peaks Ê higher than 0.5 A in the main-chain r.m.s. plots (not shown) between various trypsin structures are, in most cases, external loops that are known to be ¯exible in trypsin (Heimstad, 1996): the N1±N2 loop (residues 37±40), the calciumbinding loop (68±80), the N5±N6 loop (91± 103) and the `autolysis' loop (141±155).

² All main-chain atoms of the inhibitors are superimposed on the fold of the inhibitor in the bovine-trypsin±CPTI complex.

main-chain atoms of residue 191 and 192 at the entrance to the speci®city pocket also deviate from the benzamidine-inhibited Ê trypsin by more than 0.5 A for both salmon-trypsin complexes. These differences are most likely to be caused by inhibitor binding. The corresponding deviations for the bovine-trypsin complexes are somewhat lower. As expected, the CPTI complex superimposes well on the CMTI complex for both the salmon- and bovine-trypsin complexes, with mean main-chain r.m.s. differences of 0.073 Ê Ê and 0.167 A for the trypsin part, and 0.114 and 0.153 A for the inhibitor part, respectively. The trypsin part of the complexes has a fold which is very similar to those found for the benzamidine-inhibited complexes, with an r.m.s difference of Ê 0.25 A for the salmon-trypsin complexes. The r.m.s. values are slightly higher for the corresponding bovine-trypsin Ê complexes (0.34 A). R.m.s. values were also calculated for selected segments or residues of the polypeptide chains: all main-chain atoms of the speci®city pocket (residues 189±193 and 214±220), all atoms of the catalytic triad (His57, Asp102, Ser195), all main-chain atoms of the inhibitor-binding loop (P3±P2H ) and, ®nally, all atoms of the reactive P1 residue (data not shown). The general impression is that the tertiary fold is slightly more conserved upon complex binding for the salmon trypsin than for the bovine trypsin. This is seen by the lower r.m.s. values for salmon trypsin both when the squash complexes are compared to each other and when they are compared to the benzamidine-inhibited complex. The r.m.s. differences for the catalytic triad atoms are of the same order for the squash-inhibitor complexes when compared to the Ê benzamidine complexes ($0.44±0.48 A). The orientation of the catalytic triad is less well conserved for the two bovine-

trypsin±squash-inhibitor complexes (BT±CMTI versus BT± Ê Ê CPTI, 0.122 A; ST±CMTI versus ST±CPTI, 0.095 A). The His57 side chain in BT±CMTI is rotated about 10 (11 = 78 ) relative to the BT±CPTI complex and the salmon-trypsin± squash-inhibitor complexes. The higher r.m.s. value for the Ê Ê bovine P1 residues, which is 0.225 A compared with 0.171 A for the salmon-trypsin±squash-inhibitor complexes, is also probably caused by differences in the 11 values (BT±CMTI, À64 ; BT±CPTI, À73 ; ST±CMTI, À75 ; ST±CPTI, À75 ). The BT±BPTI complex is generally, and not surprisingly, more similar to BT±CPTI than ST±CPTI. However, the P1 residue seems to have a conformation more similar to those of the salmon-trypsin complexes. The large r.m.s. values for the binding loop are primarily caused by the difference in aminoacid sequence at positions P2 and P3. In general, the tertiary fold of the trypsin±squash-inhibitor complex seems to be better conserved when lysine is bound than when arginine is bound. The orientation of the reactive residue is practically identical for the P1-lysine complexes, and the orientation of the catalytic triad is better conserved for the CPTI complexes. The difference in the speci®city pocket and the inhibitorbinding loop seems to be of the same order for P1 arginine and P1 lysine.
3.3. Enzyme±inhibitor contacts

The binding-loop fold of the inhibitor is well conserved in all trypsin±squash-inhibitor complexes. The orientation of the P1 residue is also reasonably well conserved, regardless of whether it is lysine or arginine, and the N atoms of the lysines occupy almost the same position as the C atoms of the arginine residues. Only short segments of the 29-residue-long squash inhibitors (cf. Fig. 3) are in direct contact with the trypsin molecule in the complex. In total, 17 different trypsin residues are in contact with the inhibitor in each of the six complexes compared. Of these, only four amino acids differ between the three trypsins. Residue 39 is serine in the porcine trypsin and tyrosine in the bovine and salmon trypsins. Residue 151 is tyrosine in the mammalian trypsins and aspartic acid in salmon trypsin. Residue 175 is methionine in salmon trypsin and glutamine in the two mammalian trypsins. Finally, residue 217 is serine in the bovine trypsin and tyrosine in the two other enzymes. The P4±P2H segment of the squash-inhibitor complexes with P1 arginine forms about 130 enzyme±inhibitor contacts Ê shorter than 4.0 A (Table 3). For the squash-inhibitor P1lysine complexes the number is about 120. An additional 11±14 such contacts are formed between the inhibitor Arg1I residue and the bovine and porcine trypsins. Well de®ned electron density is not observed for the P5 residue of the salmontrypsin complexes. A maximum of 11 contacts are formed by residues other than Figure 3 the P5±P2H binding loop.

where 22 are formed by residues other than the P5±P2H loop. 12 of those are formed by the BPTI secondary binding loop [residues 36I±39I, (Scheidig et al., 1997)] and the remaining ten are formed by P3H (2) and P4H (8). The ®ve residues from P3 to P2H (Cys3I, Pro4I, Arg/Lys5I, Ile6I and Leu/Tyr7I) form Ê contacts shorter than 3.4 A to the enzyme in all complexes. The equivalent residues of BPTI form contacts with the enzyme in the bovine-trypsin BPTI complex. Such contacts are also formed by the P4 residue (Val/Ile2I) in all squashinhibitor complexes having arginine as the P1 residue, and by the P5 residue (Arg1I) in the four mammalian squash-inhiÊ bitor complexes. Other contacts shorter than 3.4 A are formed by Cys28I in ST±CMTI, Tyr27I in BT±CPTI, Met-17I and Lys19I in PT±MCTI, and Ile19I and Arg39I in BT±BPTI. 3.3.1. Primary binding contacts. As the primary binding residue (P1) is changed from a lysine in BT±BPTI, BT±CPTI and ST±CPTI to an arginine in BT±CMTI, ST±CMTI and PT± MCTI, the binding pattern at the bottom of the primary binding pocket differs between the two groups of trypsin complexes. Intermolecular contacts between the P1 amino acid of each inhibitor and the trypsin molecules for the six complexes compared are listed in Table 4, while additional enzyme±inhibitor contacts are listed in Table 5. As shown in Table 4, the main chain of the P1 residue is bound to the enzyme in the classical manner described by Bode & Huber (1992) for all six complexes (for illustration, see Fig. 4). Since the lysine side chain is about one CÐC bond shorter than the arginine side chain, substrates and substrate analogues with P1 lysine are known to bind to the substratebinding Asp189 via a water molecule (Marquart et al., 1983). This is also observed for the ST±CPTI and BT±CPTI complexes. In addition, the BT±CPTI complex forms a Ê hydrogen bond directly to Asp189 O2 (3.19 A). This hydrogen bond is also observed to some extent in the ST± Ê CPTI complex, where the distance is 3.41 A. This direct hydrogen bond is also observed in the complex formed by bovine trypsin with an engineered subtilisin inhibitor (Takeuchi et al., 1992) and bovine trypsinogen complexed with pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (Bolognesi et al., 1982). Ê The distance is 3.63 A in the BT±BPTI complex. Four hydrogen-bonding-type interactions between the main-chain P1 residue of the inhibitor and trypsin are common to the squash-inhibitor complexes and BT±BPTI. The peptide carbonyl O atom of P1 is bound in the oxyanion hole (193 N and 195 N) with similar hydrogen-bonding distances for the squash inhibitors. Both the amide N atom and the carbonyl O atom of P1 participate in hydrogen-bonding contacts with the hydroxyl O atom of Ser195. In the squash-inhibitor complexes, the P1 amide N atom also forms a relatively strong hydrogen

bond to the carbonyl O atoms of Ser214. In BPTI, the cysteine and BT±CMTI PT±MCTI proline preceding the P1 residue have switched places compared with the 11 14 squash inhibitors, and the main chain 120 125 7 5 takes a completely different orientation from that of the P3 residue; hence, the distance between the P1 amide N atom and 214 O of trypsin is longer in the BT±BPTI Ê complex (3.56 A). Whether the longer distances in the P1±S1 and P3±S3 binding sites of the BPTI complex are solely caused by the difference in the amino-acid sequence of the binding loop is not yet quite clear. The dihedral 2 angles of all squashinhibitor P1 residues are about À90 , compared with À116 in the BT±BPTI complex. The cysteine in the P2 position of BPTI could be responsible for forcing the P1 2 angle into a different conformation. The width of the speci®city pocket is approximately determined by the distance between the peptide planes of residues 215 and 191 on opposite sides of the pocket. This distance is Ê $7.90 A in both benzamidine-inhibited trypsin complexes. The distance between the carbonyl C atoms of these residues for the six trypsin±protein inhibitor complexes (Table 4) shows that there is a signi®cant enlargement of the pocket upon complex formation with the protein inhibitors compared with the benzamidine-inhibitor structures. The enlargement is more pronounced for the squash P1-Lys complexes, and less for the mammalian P1-Arg complexes. BT±BPTI and ST± CMTI fall in between. 3.3.2. Secondary binding contacts. The binding-loop residues from P5 to P2H of the squash inhibitors and residues from P3 to P4H and residue 39I of BPTI form close contacts with four to seven residues of trypsin in addition to those formed by the P1 residue (Table 5; Figs. 3 and 4). In addition to P4± P2H , MCTI also forms contacts to trypsin with residues 17I and 19I in the PT±MCTI complex. MCTI differs from the other two squash inhibitors by the deletion of residue 25I and longer side chains for residues 17I and 19I, and hence gives rise to additional contacts with trypsin. The main difference in binding properties between BPTI and the smaller inhibitors of the squash family is that the residues on the C-terminal side of the P1 residue are more heavily involved in contacts in the former (see Bode & Huber, 1992). BPTI forms seven such hydrogen bonds, while all ®ve squash inhibitors only form the one between P2H and 41 O, with almost identical lengths. Owing to its larger and more extended shape, BPTI forms additional contacts with two loops in trypsin: residues 39±40 and 97. The number of hydrogen bonds formed between the inhibitor and the enzyme on the N-terminal side of the P1 residue varies among the complexes. The P5±S5 (P5 N217±O ) interaction is only found in the two bovine-trypsin complexes owing to the difference in amino-acid composition. Only the hydrogen bond between P3 N and 216 O is conserved in all squash-inhibitor complexes and has a similar distance, except Ê for BT±CMTI where it is about 0.2 A longer than in the other complexes. This bond is not formed in BT±BPTI owing to the amino-acid difference in the inhibitor-binding loop. The

second P3±S3 bond (P3 O±216 N) is conserved among all complexes having lysine as P1. This interaction is only found in the salmon-trypsin complex when P1 is arginine. The distance is similar for all four complexes. The P2±S2 interaction from P2 O to 192 N42 is also conserved among the P1-lysine complexes, but with differing distances. This interaction is also observed for PT±MCTI. The side chain of the Nterminal arginine (I1) forms a strong ion-pair with the squashinhibitor C-terminal carboxyl group in both bovine-trypsin± squash-inhibitor complexes. Furthermore, the positively charged N-terminus forms a strong hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Ser217 of trypsin. The larger tyrosine at position 217 of salmon trypsin cannot participate in a corresponding bond in the squash-inhibitor complexes, as Tyr217 in ST±CPTI and ST±CMTI partly occupies the same space as the N-terminal of the inhibitor in the complexes with bovine trypsin, thus forcing the N-terminal arginine to a different position and probably disrupting possible salt-bridge formation with the C-terminus. This salt bridge is probably an important stabilizing factor of the squash inhibitors, and lack of the salt-bridge could be a reason for the generally less well de®ned inhibitor structure seen for the salmon complexes. Residue 217 is also a tyrosine in porcine trypsin, and should not participate in a hydrogen bond with the N-terminal of the inhibitor in the PT±MCTI complex. However, a salt bridge between the N-terminal arginine and the C-terminus is reported for this complex (Huang et al., 1993), albeit with very high mean temperature factor and hence low stability. Accomodation of the P5 arginine side chain in the porcine

complex is probably possible because of a slightly more ¯exible Tyr217 side chain. The mobility of this side chain in the salmon-trypsin complexes is restricted because of the formation of hydrogen bonds between Glu221 O41 and Asn224 O1 and a proline at position 222 of extension loop 2 (nomenclature according to Hedstrom et al., 1992). The positioning of the Arg1I side chain between the inhibitor and residue 217 probably prevents the formation of a hydrogen bond between P3 O and 216 N in BT±CMTI and PT±MCTI, as the enzyme and inhibitor are forced slightly apart. The length of the P3±S3 bonds in the BT±CPTI complex are of the same order as for the salmon complexes. The water molecule (OW1) which bridges P1 N4 and Asp189 O2 for the P1-lysine complexes causes a shift in the position of residue 216 relative to the P1 arginine complexes. The water±216 C distance is within close Ê van der Waals contacts (3.37 A). 3.3.3. Waters in contact region. All inhibitor complexes have two water molecules bound at the bottom of the binding pocket. One of the molecules has approximately the same position in all complexes, regardless of whether P1 is lysine or arginine (OW2; Fig. 4). In addition to the water molecules buried in the active-site pocket (OW1, OW2 and OW3; Fig. 4), the P1-lysine and P1-arginine squash-inhibitor complexes have three to four (BT±CMTI only) water molecules serving as bridges between trypsin and the inhibitor. Two of those are common for all six squash-inhibitor complexes (OW4 and OW6). OW5 is also present at approximately the same position in all squash-inhibitor complexes, but a hydrogen bond to residue 151 in the salmon-trypsin complexes is impossible

Stereoview of the primary and secondary binding of the squash-seed inhibitors to anionic salmon trypsin. (a) The two amine groups of the guanidino group of P1 arginine substrates bind to both O atoms of the Asp189 carboxy group. (b)The N atom of P1 lysine contacts the carboxy group of Asp189 through one direct hydrogen bond to O1 and through a water molecule to O2. (c) Of the ®ve hydrogen bonds found in the secondary binding site of ST± CPTI, only the two on the C-terminal side of the scissile bond are conserved for the six trypsin-inhibitor complexes studied. Two of the hydrogen bonds on the N-terminal side are conserved for all complexes with lysine as the reactive residue. The ®gure was produced using BOBSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991; Esnouf, 1997).

Omission of constraints on the inhibitor scissile bond during re®nement yielded a reactive-site geometry for all three complexes which is very similar to those of the already known bovine-trypsin complexes (Marquart et al., 1983). The distance between the reactive hydroxyl O atom of Ser195 and the carbonyl C Ê atom of the P1 residue is about 2.6 A, which is not signi®cantly different to that found for other comparable complexes (Table 6), and is intermediate between the van der Waals distance and a covalent bond, as discussed by Bode & Huber (1992). All other inter- and intramolecular distances at the reactive site, including the oxyanion-hole interactions, are also similar to those of previously determined trypsin complexes. The scissile peptide bond is intact for all three complexes, indicating that a resynthesis of the scissile bond must have taken place in the initially cleaved CMTI inhibitor. For both salmon-trypsin complexes Ê the scissile bond is shorter (1.23 and 1.25 A) Ê ) and the than a mean peptide bond (1.33 A scissile carbonyl double bond is longer (1.34 Ê Ê and 1.35 A relative to 1.23 A), indicating a higher degree of delocalization of the double bond. In all the mammalian complexes the CÐ Ê N bond is typically 1.33 Æ 0.1 A, except for the BPTI complex where both the scissile CÐN Ê and CÐO distances are 1.26 A. The CÐO distance for the BT±CPTI complex is longer than for the other complexes with mammalian trypsins, but shorter than for the salmontrypsin complexes. As in the ovomucoid-inhibitor complexes (Bode & Huber, 1992), no out-of-plane distortion of the carbonyl C atom was observed for the three new complexes in the present study. However, the importance of these observations should not be overestimated, as the differences, after all, are less than the crystallographic coordinate errors.

4. Discussion

owing to a different fold of the bovine-trypsin autolysis loop. Tyr151 occupies the same position in all mammalian complexes, but MCTI has a deletion at position 25I, thus forming a tighter loop which disables formation of the hydrogen bond from OW5 to Tyr151 O. OW8 is only found in BT±CMTI and links the inhibitor to the autolysis loop. OW7 in the salmon-trypsin complexes occupies the position close to the guanido group of Arg1I in the bovine-trypsin complexes.

The crystal structures of the salmon-trypsin complexes reveal a new form of salmon trypsin. The electron density clearly shows prolines at positions 24 and 28. From the genetic studies, gene loci coding for four different trypsins were identi®ed and sequenced (Male et al., 1995). One of these has a proline in position 28 (SSTRYPII), as do the bovine and porcine trypsins, but all known anionic salmon trypsins have alanine at position 24. However, additional forms of trypsin from Atlantic salmon are not surprising, since salmoid ®sh species are well known for their complex isoenzyme patterns (see, for

However, interactions between P1 lysine (CPTI), bind to the active sites of both salmon and mutants of BPTI, STI (soybean trypsin inhibitor) or squash bovine trypsins in a classical manner in most respects. The inhibitors with bovine and salmon trypsins, show only a approximate sixfold and threefold (salmon and bovine trypmoderate preference for lysine or arginine. Comparing the sins, respectively) higher association of CPTI (P1 lysine inhiantibody±antigen and proteinase inhibitor complexes in terms bitor) compared to CMTI (P1 arginine inhibitor) is, however, of the hydrogen-bonding network does not easily account for not straightforwardly interpretable from these results. The the observed thermodynamic differences. present study reveals that lysine at P1 is able to form direct Studies of association between trypsin and small synthetic hydrogen-bond interactions with the trypsin-speci®c Asp189 inhibitors which form interactions exclusively with the P1 at the bottom of the binding pocket, and not only through a binding pocket (Os & Otlewski, unpublished results), show water molecule as previously assumed. The relatively close that anionic salmon trypsin binds both lysine and arginine interaction between the P1-lysine N atom and the carboxylate Ê analogues up to 20 times more strongly than the bovine O atom of Asp189 (3.2 and 3.4 A for BT±CPTI and ST±CPTI, counterpart. Also, the Michaelis±Menten constant (KM) for respectively) is not found in the BT±BPTI complex. The the binding of small synthetic substrates indicates that salmon shorter distance for the CPTI complexes seems to arise from trypsin forms interactions within the primary-binding pocket the substitution of a cysteine in position P2 of BPTI by a stronger than those formed by porcine and bovine trypsins proline in CPTI. This introduces a different dihedral 2 angle (Outzen et al., 1996). However, association constants for on the P2 peptide, allowing the P1 lysine to bind slightly salmon and bovine trypsins are very similar for both squash deeper in the binding pocket.

inhibitors. From these results it is likely that the increased primary binding observed for salmon trypsin is compensated for by weaker secondary interactions, which results in similar values of the association constant Ka for the binding of squash inhibitors to bovine and salmon trypsins. The ST±CMTI complex was crystallized with the P1±P1H peptide bond of CMTI in a hydrolyzed state. The crystal structure of the complex, however, shows that the peptide bond is intact and that there are no differences between this bond and the corresponding bond in the other complexes where the peptide bond was initially intact. A resynthesis of the cleaved bond has thus taken place during the formation of the complex. This is probably accomplished from the strong binding to trypsin, forcing the terminals of the cleaved peptide into a position where resynthesis can occur. The crystallographic re®nements of all three complexes were carried out with no energy constraints on the P1 peptide, thus allowing an unbiased judgment of the state of the reactive site. There is no out-of-plane distortion for the reactive peptide in any of the three complexes, and no indication of partly cleaved inhibitors. On the other hand, as reported for other proteinase± inhibitor complexes (Bode & Huber, 1992), the distance between the active serine hydroxyl group of trypsin and the P1 peptide carbonyl C atom is shorter than expected from their Ê van der Waals radii. The O ±C distances of about 2.6 A indicate that the interaction is intermediate between a van der Waals interaction and a covalent bond. It should also be stressed that clear resynthesis of the reactive-site peptide bond and also all other interactions developed in the ST±CMTI complex indicate that the complex is exactly the same as that formed from the reactive-site-intact inhibitor.
