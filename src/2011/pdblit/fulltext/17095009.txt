The Thiobacillus denitrificans genome contains two sequences corresponding to ATP sulfurylase (Tbd_0210 and Tbd_0874). Both genes were cloned and expressed protein characterized. The larger protein (Tbd_0210; 544 residues) possesses an N-terminal ATP sulfurylase domain and a C-terminal APS kinase domain and was therefore annotated as a bifunctional enzyme. But, the protein was not bifunctional because it lacked ATP sulfurylase activity. However, the enzyme did possess APS kinase activity and displayed substrate inhibition by APS. Truncated protein missing the N-terminal domain had <2% APS kinase activity suggesting the function of the inactive sulfurylase domain is to promote the oligomerization of the APS kinase domains. The smaller gene product (Tbd_0874; 402 residues) possessed strong ATP sulfurylase activity with kinetic properties that appear to be kinetically optimized for the direction of APS utilization and ATP + sulfate production, which is consistent with an enzyme that functions physiologically to produce inorganic sulfate.

``PAPS synthetase" in which the two sulfate activating enzyme activities are co-located on a single polypeptide chain. ATP sulfurylase plays three different roles in nature: (a) In fungi, yeasts, most heterotrophic bacteria, algae, and higher plants, this enzyme catalyzes the first intracellular reaction in the reductive assimilation of inorganic sulfate into organic molecules (cysteine, methionine, etc.). Algae, plants, and some bacteria use APS directly as the substrate for the reductive assimilation pathway, while other sulfate assimilators use PAPS. All organisms use PAPS as the sulfuryl donor for sulfate ester biosynthesis, e.g., chondroitin sulfate, heparin, and sulfated cell surface glycoproteins in animals; choline-O-sulfate in fungi; flavinol sulfates in plants. (b) In anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria (e.g., Desulfovibrio), ATP sulfurylase forms APS solely to serve as the terminal electron acceptor of heterotrophic metabolism. (c) In certain chemoand photolithotrophic bacteria (e.g., Aquifex, Thiobacillus, Chromatium), ATP sulfurylase catalyzes the final reaction in the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds to sulfate, i.e., the physiological reaction is in the opposite direction compared to that in sulfate assimilators and sulfate reducers. In sulfur chemolithotrophs, APS is formed by the AMP-coupled oxidation of inorganic sulfite. (The sulfite is produced from sulfide, thiosulfate, or other reduced inorganic sulfur compounds in the organism's environment.) Sulfur chemolithotrophs and sulfate assimilators that reduce APS might still possess an active APS kinase if they also need sulfate esters. A comparison of the kinetic properties of ATP sulfurylases from various sulfate assimilators with chemolithotrophs like Aquifex

aeolicus [1] and the Riftia pachyptila symbiont [2] suggested that the kinetic constants of the enzyme are well adapted to the physiological direction used by the host organism. That is, ATP sulfurylases from chemolithotrophs have rather high Km and Ki values for inorganic sulfate compared to the values for sulfurylases from sulfate assimilators. This difference makes sense considering that under physiological conditions, chemolithotrophs form and release sulfate into high-sulfate environments. However, both Aquifex and the Riftia symbiont are marine organisms and the former is a thermophile (but the enzyme kinetics were performed at 30 °C). Consequently, it was not immediately certain whether the differences noted were reflections of the physiologically relevant reaction direction, or related to the organisms' marine environment or optimum growth temperature. To help settle the question, we examined the functional properties of ATP sulfurylase from Thiobacillus denitrificans, a terrestrial mesophilic chemolithotroph. Upon initiating the project, we saw that the genome of T. denitrificans appeared to possess sequences of two different ATP sulfurylases (genes Tbd_0210 and Tbd_0874). The larger gene product (Tbd_0210) contained a C-terminal domain that exhibited homology to APS kinase and was thus annotated to be a bifunctional enzyme. (The T. denitrificans genome does not possess any other genes that display homology to APS kinase.) This report describes the cloning, expression, and kinetic analysis of these gene products. Results revealed that the bifunctional enzyme is incorrectly annotated because it only displayed APS kinase activity. The smaller ATP sulfurylase gene product proved to be catalytically active with kinetic parameters similar to other chemolithotrophs. Materials and methods Cloning of ATP sulfurylase Thiobacillus denitrificans ATCC 25259 genomic DNA was obtained from Dr. Sherry Huston (Douglas C. Nelson Laboratory, University of California, Davis). The open reading frame encoding the putative ATP sulfurylase (Tbd_0874) was amplified by PCR using primers listed in Table 1. The 30 lL PCR mixture included 0.1 lL Pfu Turbo Cx (Stratagene), 3 lL of 10Â Pfu DNA polymerase buffer (Stratagene), 5% DMSO, 84 lM each of dATP, dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP (Promega), approximately 1 lM of each primer, and approximately 3.3 ng/mL template DNA. The mixture was subjected to 30 PCR cycles consisting of 1 min melting at 95 °C, 1 min annealing at 55 °C, and 3 min extension at 72 °C, and a final incubation of 10 min at 72 °C to ensure any partially extended products were completed. This process introduced NdeI (50 ) and XhoI (30 ) restriction sites. In order to hybridize with the stretch of thymine bases in the TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), a poly adenine tail was added to the DNA by adding Taq polymerase (Qiagen) and incubating at 72 °C

for 10 min. The gene was then ligated into the TOPO cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) using a standard protocol. Plasmid DNA was isolated from colonies using the Qiaquick Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). The gene sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing using T7 and M13 Reverse primers (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA). The gene was then subcloned as an NdeI/XhoI (New England Biolabs) fragment into pET-22b(+) (Novagen) with a C-terminal 6Â His tag. This plasmid was chemically transformed into BL21-DE3 (Stratagene) for protein expression. Cloning of APS kinase The open reading frame encoding the putative bifunctional ATP sulfurylase/APS kinase (Tbd_0210) was amplified by PCR using primers listed in Table 1. The gene was cloned using the protocol described above. Cloning of APS kinase C-terminus The open reading frame encoding the C-terminus of the putative bifunctional ATP sulfurylase/APS kinase was amplified by PCR using primers listed in Table 1. Two separate constructs of the C-terminus were created, one starting at residue Arg-365 and another starting at Arg-326. The second construct contains a stretch of two helices between the ATP sulfurylase-like domain and the APS kinase domain. The genes were cloned using the protocol described above. Protein expression and purification One milliliter of overnight culture grown at 37 °C in LB media containing 100 lg/mL of ampicillin (Fisher) was added to each of six 2-L baffled flasks containing 1 L of LB medium. Inoculated media were incubated at 37 °C with shaking until the OD600nm reached approximately 1. Cultures were cooled to 15 °C and protein expression was induced with 2 mM a-lactose. Protein expression was allowed to continue for 12­15 h at 15 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000g for 15 min using a Beckman JLA 8.1000 rotor in a Beckman-Avanti J-20 centrifuge. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 mL buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, and 10 mM imidazole, pH 8) at 4 °C and passed through a Watts Fluidair Microfluidizer three to four times to lyse the cells. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 39,000g for 20 min using a Beckman JLA 16.250 rotor in the same centrifuge as above. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The soluble portion was then loaded onto a Sigma His-Select column (equilibrated with buffer A). The column was washed with buffer A for approximately 15 column volumes, followed by 30 column volumes of wash buffer B (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, and 20 mM imidazole, pH 8) until the A280nm was below 0.02. The enzyme was eluted with buffer C (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8) into 2 mL fractions over 15 column volumes total. Fractions containing the major A280nm peak were examined by SDS­PAGE and then pooled. The pooled fractions were dialyzed against 2 L of 40 mM Tris­Cl buffer, pH 8.0 at 4 °C. The C-terminal construct of APS kinase required a separate dialysis buffer to maintain stability. This buffer consisted of 20 mM Tris­Cl, pH 8.0 at 4 °C containing 200 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, and 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Purified protein was concentrated in Millipore spin concentrators to 5­15 mg/mL. Protein concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm. The molar extinction coefficients used were 56,150 MÀ1 cmÀ1 (APS kinase), 47,090 MÀ1 cmÀ1 (ATP sulfurylase), and 12,450 MÀ1 cmÀ1 (truncated APS kinase) as calculated by Vector NTI Advance 10.3 (Invitrogen). All proteins were >95% pure as estimated by SDS­PAGE.

Chemicals and coupling enzymes Assay components including ATP, NADH, NADP , PEP, and coupling enzymes were purchased from Sigma as listed previously [1]. Recombinant APS kinase from Penicillium chrysogenum was prepared as described previously [3]. ATP sulfurylase assays All assays were performed in buffer D (50 mM Tris­Cl, pH 8) at 30 °C. Activity in the APS synthesis direction was measured by the continuous spectrophotometric assay described previously [1,2,4]. In this assay, the formation of APS is coupled to NADH oxidation in the presence of excess APS kinase, inorganic pyrophosphatase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase. This assay quantifies the rate of ADP formed by the coupled APS kinase reaction. Activity with molybdate, a ``short-circuiting" inorganic substrate was measured by following the formation of AMP. In this assay, APS kinase was replaced by excess myokinase (adenylate kinase). (However, a low level of APS kinase was usually included to deal with trace amounts of APS that might be formed from contaminating sulfate in the reagents.) The reaction was started by adding the inorganic substrate. Activity in ATP formation direction was measured by the APS plus PPi-dependent reduction of NADP+ in the presence of glucose, excess hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [1,2,4]. The reaction was started by adding APS. Absorption measurements at A340nm were measured on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda model 11. ATP sulfurylase concentrations in the range 30­150 and 3­15 ng/mL were used for assays in the APS formation direction and ATP synthesis direction, respectively. Because T. denitrificans ATP sulfurylase was found to be unstable at high dilutions, the stock enzyme solution was diluted appropriately just prior to the assay. APS kinase assays

where [A] is the MgATP concentration, [B] is the MoO4 2À concentration, and [APS]0.5 is the concentration of APS yielding 50% inhibition. (The equation assumes that MgATP and MoO4 2À add randomly and that APS is competitive with both substrates, as observed for other ATP sulfurylases that have been studied.) KmQ (Michaelis constant of ATP sulfurylase for APS in the ATP synthesis direction) was estimated as the APS concentration remaining when the steady state rate had decreased to one-half of the Vmax value in a reaction progress measurement starting at 10 lM APS and 500 lM PPi. (Vmax was estimated separately at 100 lM APS and 500 lM PPi.) Keq for the ATP sulfurylase reaction in the direction of APS synthesis was estimated using the Haldane equation:

KmP is the Michaelis constant for total PPi at saturating APS concentration, Kia is the dissociation constant for the EÁMgATP complex, and KmB is the Michaelis constant for SO4 2À at saturating MgATP.

KmB and Vmax correspond to the apparent constants for APS at fixed concentrations of MgATP. KIB is the apparent inhibition constant for [APS] (i.e., substrate B) binding to the EÁMgADP (i.e., the EÁQ complex) to form a dead end EÁBÁQ complex at the fixed [MgATP] [3,5,6]. The v versus [MgATP] at [APS]opt velocity curves for APS kinase were fitted to the Henri­Michaelis­Menten equation. Results and conclusions

APS kinase activity was assayed by the pyruvate kinase + lactate dehydrogenase + nuclease P1 coupled spectrophotometric assay [1,3,5]. Nuclease P1 maintains a constant concentration of APS by dephosphorylating PAPS at the 30 position. All assays were performed in buffer D at 30 °C. Unlike studies of P. chrysogenum APS kinase, 200 mM NaCl was not needed to resolve the activity peak near the optimum APS concentration [6]. Before starting the assay, T. denitrificans APS kinase was incubated at approximately 7.5 mg/ mL with 10 mM DTT at 30 °C for 30 min. (DTT cannot be added directly to the reaction mixture because it inactivates Nuclease P1.) APS kinase (and the DTT) was diluted extensively immediately before assay. The enzyme was present at ca. 750 ng/mL in the assay mixture. Reaction rates were measured as described above. Data analysis Primary velocity curves for families of varied [MgATP], [SO4 2À ], [MoO4 2À ], and [PPi], as well as non-linear replots were fitted to the Henri­Michaelis­Menten equation using DeltaGraph 4.05.

ATP sulfurylase activity The sequence of the larger gene product (gene Tbd_0210; designated T.d. APSK) resembles that of the P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase in that it contains an N-terminal ATP sulfurylase-like domain and a C-terminal APS kinase-like domain. X-ray crystallographic studies (PDB ID 3CR8) [8] indicate that this two-domain enzyme is hexameric, resembling the fungal [9,10] and yeast [11] sulfurylases. The C-terminal domains of the fungal and yeast enzymes have no APS kinase activity. Rather, in the P. chrysogenum enzyme, the C-terminal domain provides an allosteric site for binding PAPS, which down regulates the ATP sulfurylase activity. In the yeast sulfurylase, that domain is highly degenerated and appears to function solely to foster hexamerization. The primary sequence of the two-domain T. denitrificans protein also resembles the ATP sulfurylase/APS kinase enzyme from A. aeolicus, a thermophilic sulfur chemolithotroph. In that protein, both domains are catalytically active [1], but it only assembles into a dimer [12]. However, the two-domain T. denitrificans protein had no detectable ATP sulfurylase activity in either the APS synthesis or the ATP synthesis directions. Nor did it display ``short-circuit" (AMP + PPi-producing) activity with molybdate, or tungstate, or selenate replacing sulfate. (It did, however, possess APS kinase activity ­ see below.) Examination of the primary sequence provides reasonable explanations for the absence of sulfurylase activity (Fig. 1). For example, in the highly conserved active site stretch corresponding to 197 QTRNPMHRAH206 in P. chrysogenum ATP sulfurylase (P.c. ATPS), the T. denitrificans sequence (T.d. APSK) has three substitutions. These are (a) T?A at the position that normally hydrogen bonds

Limiting constants were obtained from the appropriate non-linear replots (Vmax,app versus [cosubstrate]). The data were also analyzed by double reciprocal plots and appropriate linear slope and intercept replots [7]. Kiq (the dissociation constant of the EÁAPS complex) was calculated from the degree of inhibition exerted by APS against the molybdolysis reaction (in the absence of added APS kinase) according to Eq. (2)

Q at a position that normally hydrogen bonds to the pyrophosphoryl or adenine ring of ATP. (d) In addition, Ala-295 of P.c. ATPS whose main chain amide hydrogen bonds to an oxygen of bound sulfate or APS, is replaced by Phe in T.d. APSK. But more significantly, the highly conserved 291GRDH294 of P.c. ATPS, which forms a turn that orients Ala-295, is replaced by AR­N. Indeed, a large upstream part of the active site pocket (corresponding to 280RKNHGATHFIVGRDHA295 in P.c. ATPS) is missing

eight residues in T.d. APSK. T.d. APSK is also missing several residues in a mobile loop called the ``active site switch" (residues 228­239 in P.c. ATPS). This stretch is in a ``closed" or ``down" position in the R state of allosteric P.c. ATPS when APS is bound at the active site [9]; it is in an ``open" or ``up" position in the T state of this enzyme when the active site is empty [10]. In P.c. ATPS, a large movement of this loop accompanies the R/T transition. Smaller movements of the loop may play a role in the normal catalytic cycle. This suggestion is based on the observation that the ``active site switch" residues, including Asp-234 (P.c. ATPS numbering), are

114

conserved in all active ATP sulfurylases that have been sequenced, most of which are not allosteric or display cooperativity. In the ``down" position, Asp-234 of the loop interacts with (and thus, partially neutralizes the charge of) Arg-199 at the sulfate binding site. This charge interaction may promote a redistribution of the two negative charges of sulfate and/or a small shift in the position of the bound sulfate leading to a more favorable approach to the transition state. (Mutant P. chrysogenum enzymes, R234A and R234N, are almost completely inactive with sulfate as the inorganic substrate although they still have measurable activity with molybdate, which does not form a stable APMo product [manuscript in preparation].) The shorter T. denitrificans gene product (gene Tbd_0874; designated T.d. ATPS) displayed strong ATP sulfurylase activity, as expected from conserved sequences in catalytically important regions (Fig. 1). All primary initial velocity plots were hyperbolic. The primary plots and appropriate replots [7] yielded the kinetic constants summarized in Table 2. This enzyme has a higher specific activity in either direction than ATP sulfurylases from filamentous fungi [13­15], yeast [16], mammals [17,18], and other chemolithotrophs [1,2]. ATP sulfurylases from higher plants have high specific activities similar to those of the enzyme from chemolithotrophs [19]. Like ATP sulfurylases from other chemolithotrophs that have been studied, the Michaelis constant of T.d. ATPS for inorganic sulfate is more than an order of magnitude higher than the values for sulfurylases from sulfate assimilators (Fig. 2). Hanna et al. [1] and Renosto et al. [2] suggested that the poor sulfate ``affinity" of ATP sulfurylases from sulfur chemolithotrophs may reflect the enzyme's optimization for the direction of MgATP + SO4 2À formation. At first glance, this seems reasonable considering that the chemolithotrophs usually reside in high-sulfate environments, e.g., 30 mM in seawater [20] and coelomic blood of symbiont hosts [21]. But if chemolithotrophic ATP sulfurylases evolved first, the major evolutionary pressure may have been exerted on non-chemolithotrophic sulfate assimilators to optimize the enzyme for the APS synthesis direction. In spite of the differences in kinetic constants between ATP sulfurylases from sulfur chemolithotrophs and sulfate assimilators, the Keq value of the reaction calculated from the Haldane equation

(Eq. (3)) is, as expected, the same in all cases (ca. 10À7 in the APS synthesis direction) [1,2,16­19]. (This value is a thermodynamic property of the reaction and not a property of the enzyme.) APS kinase activity The larger protein possessed APS kinase activity. As with other APS kinases, the v versus [MgATP] curves were hyperbolic at all fixed APS levels, but the v versus [APS] curves display substrate inhibition (Fig. 3). Enzyme activity was much lower without a prior 30-min incubation in the presence of 10 mM DTT (data not shown). This effect is similar to that observed with the bifunctional enzyme from A. aeolicus [1]. The substrate inhibition exerted by APS is a consequence of the sequential ordered kinetic mechanism. In this mechanism, MgATP (A) binds before APS (B). Once this EÁAÁB complex forms, phosphoryl transfer occurs followed by an ordered release of products. PAPS (P) dissociates before MgADP (Q) [22]. Substrate inhibition occurs because APS binds to the EÁMgADP transient complex to form a dead end EÁBÁQ complex [6,22,23]. The optimal APS concentration decreases as MgATP concentration increases, a feature consistent with the proposed uncompetitive substrate inhibition mechanism [5]. At a near-saturating level of MgATP, the optimal APS concentration is 10 lM which is about the same as that reported for the bifunctional enzyme from A. aeolicus [1] and human tissues, but is higher than that found for monofunctional APS kinases from Arabidopsis thaliana (1­2 lM) [24], P. chrysogenum (3­5 lM) [3,6,22], and Escherichia coli (1­3 lM) [25]. Other relevant kinetic constants are summarized in Table 3. Truncated APS kinase activity To determine if the N-terminal domain of T.d. APSK influenced the APS kinase activity of the C-terminal domain, two truncated forms of the protein were constructed using the primers shown in Table 1. One form starts at Arg-326 and the other at Arg-365. Both starting points were located in the tail end of the ATP sulfurylase domain. Both expressed enzymes behaved similarly in that Vmax,app and vopt were about 1% that of the full length protein and APS did not display substrate inhibition until its concentration

The results suggest that the C-terminal domain of T.d. APSK, although devoid of ATP sulfurylase activity, was retained in order to promote catalytic activity in the N-terminal APS kinase domain ­ possibly by facilitating dimerization (twofold within the hexamer) of the latter as seen in other active APS kinase structures [12,23,27,28].

Discussion ATP sulfurylase is one of three enzymes encoded in the T. denitrificans genome that can catalyze the terminal step in the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds. Of the other two, one is a sulfite dehydrogenase that oxidizes sulfite directly to sulfate through a two electron oxidation [29]. It is not known whether this process is coupled to ATP formation. The other enzyme is APS:phosphate adenylyltransferase (APAT), which is sometimes referred to as ADP sulfurylase [30]. APAT uses inorganic phosphate and APS to produce sulfate and ADP [29]. It has been suggested that the major role of ATP sulfurylase in chemolithotrophs is to recycle PPi produced by biosynthetic reactions in a maximally efficient manner [1]. (For each mole of sulfite oxidized to sulfate via

the coupled APS reductase + ATP sulfurylase sequence, one mole of PPi plus one mole of AMP would be converted directly to ATP). Two ATP sulfurylase-like genes from T. denitrificans were cloned, expressed in E. coli, and purified. The shorter gene product (402 residues, designated T.d. ATPS) is a monofunctional ATP sulfurylase. The amino acid sequence of T.d. ATPS is 58% similar and 44% identical to the ATP sulfurylase from the R. pachyptila (hydrothermal vent tube worm) symbiont [31,32]. Even higher sequence identity (68%) exists between T.d. ATPS and the putative ATP sulfurylase from Candidatus Ruthia magnifica, the Calyptogena magnifica (hydrothermal vent clam) symbiont [33]. Like the other sulfur chemolithotroph sulfurylases that have been studied, T.d. ATPS has much higher Michaelis and dissociation constants for sulfate than any of the sulfurylases from sulfate assimilators [1,2]. This characteristic is independent of the chemolithotroph's environment (marine or terrestrial) or optimum growth temperature (thermophile or mesophile). The structural basis for the kinetic differences is still unknown. Crystal structures of the enzymes from two sulfur chemolithotrophs (Riftia symbiont and A. aeolicus) show a sulfate subsite region that is constructed identically to that of the enzyme from sulfate assimilators. Perhaps the kinetic difference

results from small sequence differences in the ``active site switch" that influences the interaction of the loop's Asp with the sulfate subsite Arg. That is, the ``active site switch" may spend a larger fraction of the turnover time in the ``up" (low sulfate affinity) position in chemolithotroph sulfurylases. The larger gene product (544 residues, designated T.d. APSK) appeared to be a bifunctional protein in that it was composed of an N-terminal ATP sulfurylase-like domain and a C-terminal APS kinase-like domain. However, the protein was devoid of ATP sulfurylase activity. The absence of activity could be correlated with numerous amino acid substitutions in critical regions (Fig. 1). The protein did possess APS kinase activity. As observed in all other native APS kinases [1,6,17,24,25,34,35], the enzyme displays substrate inhibition with respect to APS. Preincubation with DTT was necessary in order to observe maximal APS kinase activity. No disulfide bonds were found in a recent crystal structure of the enzyme (PDB ID 3CR8) [8] although eight Cys residues are present. Six are buried in the interior of the enzyme, but Cys-274 and Cys-482 are located within disordered regions of the model structure. Based on sequence and structural alignments, Cys-274 is located in a region corresponding to the apex of a surface loop in other ATP sulfurylase structures [9,10,12,31]. This region is far from the APS kinase active site. On the other hand, Cys-482 lies within the kinase domain and is located in a region corresponding to the mobile active site lid in other APS kinase enzymes [12,23,28,36]. The analogous residue in the B chain of the A. aeolicus bifunctional enzyme makes a disulfide bond with a Cys on the P-loop [12]. However, there is no Cys residue in the P loop of T.d. APSK (residues 376­382 ­ see Fig. 1). It is likely then that the effect of DTT is to reduce disulfide bonds formed between enzyme molecules randomly during purification. The origin of the N-terminal sulfurylase-like domain found in T.d. APSK is unknown. The two ATP sulfurylase-like regions of T.d. ATPS and T.d. APSK are only 18% identical suggesting that one did not arise from the other by gene duplication. The APS kinase domain from T.d. APSK shares 48% sequence identity to the bifunctional ATP sulfurylase/APS kinase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides [37]. Given that the two sulfate activating enzymes from T. denitrificans share higher sequence identity to enzymes from other

organisms than they do to each other suggests that T.d. APSK may have arisen by lateral gene transfer.
