YUKO HAZAMA,* K. HAZAMAt and L. EHRENBERG
Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Stockholm University (Received 22 October 1962) Abstract--Barley seeds were soaked in solutions of paramagnetic ions and irradiated with y-rays after desiccating back to low water contents. The modification of the radiation sensitivity produced by the paramagnetic ions was measured by the difference in the reduction of seedling height, or induced sterility, between treatments with paramagnetic and similar diamagnetic ions. In dry seeds, paramagnetic ions demonstrated a protective action under one atmosphere of air, but in some cases, e.g., at a high water content, in the absence of oxygen, or under a high oxygen pressure, this protection could not be detected. These facts demonstrated that paramagnetic ions exerted their protective action at a very early stage of events, possibly through a quenching of excited triplet states. R6sum&--Des graines d'orge ont 6t6 trempfes dans des solutions d'ions paramagn6tiques et, aprbs dess6chement jusqu'~t de faibles teneurs en eau, elles ont 6t6 irradi6es par les rayons y. La modification de sensibilit6 produite par les ions paramagndtiques a 6t6 mesur6e par la diminution de hauteur des plantules ou de la st6rilitd induite entre des traitements par des ions paramagn6tiques et des ions diamagndtiques similaires. Dans le cas de graines s6ches, les ions paramagndtiques ont montrd une action protectrice sous une atmosphere d'air mais, dans quelques cas, par ex. avec une teneur 61ev6e en eau, en l'absence d'oxyg~ne, ou ~t nne pression 61evfe d'oxyg~ne, une telle protection ne s'est pas rdv616e. Ces faits ont ddmontr6 que l'action protectrice des ions paramagn6tiques s'exerce ~ des stades tr~s prdcoces probablement par l'extinction des 6tats triplets excit0s.

Die verursachte Ver~inderung der Strahlenempfindlichkeit wurde als Unterschied an Zuwachshemmung der Keimpflanzen oder an induzierte Sterilit~it zwischen Behandlungen mit paramagnetischen und ~ihnlichen diamagnetischen Ionen gemessen. In trockenen Samen in Gleichgewicht mit Luft zeigten die paramagnetischen Ionen eine Schutzwirkung, die aber unter Umst~inden, z.B. bei erh6htem Wassergehalt, bei Abwesenheit yon Sauerstoff oder unter hohem Sauerstoffdruck nicht nachgewiesen werden konnte. Die Ergebnisse sind damit vereinbar, dass die Schutzwirkung durch einen sehr frtihen Eingriff der paramagnetischen Ionen in die Reihenfolge der radiobiologischen Ereignisse zustandekommt, m6glicherweise durch eine quenching (Erstickung) yon angeregten Triplet-Zust~inden.

ones, and the difference was greater than could be expected from oxygen-conditioned, slow after-effects. This raises the question of whether a quenching of excited molecules could be provoked by high concentrations of paramagnetic centers at high dose-rates. EHRENBERG et al.(7) give very indirect evidence that the protection of m e d i u m water contents in seeds is due to some kind of degradation of excitation energy. This evidence is supported by KAPLAN'S(12) data for the considerably greater influence of the water content on the sensitivity to U V irradiation (of bacteria and DNA) than has been found in different materials irradiated with X- or 7-rays. T h e fate of an excited molecule or atom m a y be different. An excited singlet returns to the ground state very rapidly (in about 10 -9 sec), with or without the emission of light, the singlet-triplet transition being more or less "forbidden". The decay of an excited triplet to the (singlet) ground state is equally forbidden; this increases the probability that a molecule excited to tile triplet state will react, e.g. with oxygen, a reaction which usually leads to a hydroperoxide molecule. Further, if the energy of the excited triplet is sufficiently high, the molecule m a y be decomposed, e.g., into free radicals. I n tile presence of paramagnetic molecules and heavy atoms, the forbiddenness of singlettriplet and excited triplet-ground state transitions is less rigorous. Effects interpreted along these lines have been demonstrated in chemical systems as a quenching of fluorescence and phosphorescenceO4,~2); PORTER and WRIGHT(19) found that paramagnetic ions and, still more effectively, oxygen, nitric oxide (NO), and triplet anthracene, quenched triplet naphthalene, and BEUKERS and BERENDS(1) demonstrated that paramagnetic ions and oxygen protected pyrimidines against a certain type of UV-produced chemical change, dimerization, also known to be induced in DNA.( TM With such possibilities in mind, we have studied exploratorily the influence of paramagnetic ions on the radiation sensitivity of plant seeds. T h e advantage of this experimental material is that, before the onset of germination, the seeds are relatively insensitive to the toxic

Seeds of two-rowed barley (Sval6f's variety 02102) were predominantly used in the present study, but seeds of Agrostis stolonifera (Weibull's variety Z104) were used for a preliminary determination of free radicals by means of electron spin resonance (ESR). The seeds were irradiated with 6°Co It-radiation at a dose rate of 9,000 rad/min. T h e irradiation was carried out in equilibrium with air, and water, similarly in equilibrium with air, was added immediately after irradiation. In some cases, the irradiation was made in nitrogen or under high oxygen pressure; in the former case air-free water was added after irradiation. The following ions were used: Paramagnetic ions : M n 2+, Fe 2+, Co 2+, Ni ~+, Cu 2+, and Fe(CN)~ Diamagnetic ions : Mg 2 +, Zn 2 +, and Fe(CN)64 All positive ions were given as the sulfates, and the iron cyanide complex ions were given as the potassium salts, KsFe(CN)6 and K~Fe(CN)n respectively. The salts were mostly introduced by soaking the seeds for 4 hr in water solutions at 20°C, the weight of which were ten times those of the seed samples treated. Before irradiation the seeds were then desiccated to low water contents. Since it was known that the metal ions mentioned above are more or less toxic to the seedling growth, the degree of this toxicity of each ion was determined before the irradiation experiment. It was found that all ions exhibited a strong toxicity when the seeds were sown without prior washing, but the concentration of some ions, such as Fe 2+, M n 2+ and Mg 2+, could be decreased below the toxicity level by washing with water. The duration of the washing was 24 hr. Although tile toxic effects of other ions could not be abolished totally by this method, washing with 1 per cent E D T A for the first 4 hr was effective for this purpose. T h e

INFLUENCE OF PARAMAGNETIC IONS ON RADIATION SENSITIVITY were always identical with the diamagnetic control series. Tiffs demonstrates that the action of the paramagnetic ions is not produced by some kind of interference with (the late) biochemical reactions. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that under certain conditions--high water content or very high or very low oxygen tension--the ions do not modify the radiation sensitivity even when present during irradiation. I n the dry seeds, the net effect of oxygen consists in an increase of the radiation damage in accordance with the experience from most materials, part at least of the effect being dependent on the formation of harmful peroxy radicals or peroxides.(s,6) A decrease of the intracellular oxygen tension, or a reduction of positive ion radicals or other radiation-chemically produced oxidized molecules, constitute other mechanisms of protection to be considered, especially for such easily oxidizable ions as Fe 2+ and M n 2+ (as a matter of fact, certain experiments indicate that Fe ~ + exerts an action by decreasing the oxygen content), but this mode of'action is less plausible for Cu 2 +, Ni 2 +, Co 2 ÷ (unless certain complexes with favourable oxidation potentials are formed), and, especially, Fe(CN) 3 -. C o m m o n to all the paramagnetic ions studied is, however, their ability to catalyze the decomposition of peroxides, an action mechanism which our experiments can not at present exclude. In a simple system such reactions would not a priori decrease the n u m b e r of long-lived free radicals. In experiments with CoSO 4 absorbed in seeds of Agrostis stolonifera or absorbed on starch, a decrease by about 20 per cent of the ?-ray induced free radicals was noted, however, in comparison with the controls treated with MgSO4, ZnSO4, or H 2 0 . (Unlike the other ions studied, Co 2 + does not behave as a free radical, and it permits therefore the measurement of the ESR spectrum of the radiation induced free radicals without the complication of a superimposed signal from the paramagnetic ion.) This effect supports the idea, that at least part of the action of the paramagnetic ions is due to a quenching of excited states, decreasing their time to react, e.g., to decompose into free radicals. The ESR measure-

be extremely complicated (it suffices to compare wittl the radiobiologic mechanisms of oxygen, which are not definitely clarified in spite of hundreds of papers dealing with the subject) and m a n y further experiments are needed to give a complete picture. T h e present experiments must therefore be regarded as very preliminary and permit only a superficial discussion. It must be pointed out that very little is known of the excited states formed by energy rich radiations, most investigations dealing with the lowest singlet obtained with u.v. or visible light, and its transition to the more long-lived excited triplet.(22) In the complicated system of tissue exposed to ionizing radiation practically nothing is known about which excited states are formed primarily and secondarily, nor about the relative roles of decomposition (decomposition of excited singlet molecules probably rare in liquid or solid tissue), degradation to vibrational energy and reactivity. In the highly viscous, almost solid material represented by dry seed embryos, it could be expected, however, that excited triplet states are fairly long-lived (cf. PORTER and WRIGHT(19) and the discussion following their paper(2°)). One possible mechanism of the action of the paramagnetic ions consists in the deactivation of the excited triplet, i.e., in an increase of the rate of tim otherwise forbidden triplet-ground state transition, thus decreasing the probability of tbrmation of harmful peroxides in reactions of excited triplets with oxygen or equally harmful free radicals formed in the decomposition of the triplets. The degradation of the excitation energy to heat and the restoration of the original state of the molecule will thus lead to a protection. Since these changes occur within a very short time after irradiation, the quencher must be present at the time of irradiation in order to be effective. Most of the common paramagnetic ions participate in biochemical reactions, e.g., as activators in metal enzymes or as enzyme inhibitors. T h e protective action of the metal ions could only be demonstrated when the ion in question was present during irradiation. Repeated parallel series, where the ion was present after irradiation, by soaking the irradiated seeds in the respective salt solutions

Y. HAZAMA, K. HAZAMA and L. EHRENBERG ments must be regarded as preliminary, however, since they were made after irradiation with about 1 Mrad, i.e., about 100 times the doses applied in the radiobiological experiments. T h e fact that, in the present experiments, the effects of the paramagnetic ions could be observed only under certain rather specific conditions (low water content, medium oxygen tension) indicates a rather specific mechanism of action, not only excluding interference with the late biochemical and physiological reaction chains during germination. I f we suppose, at present as a working hypothesis, that the protective action of M n 2+, Co s+, Ni e+, Cu 2+, and Fe(CN) 3- reflects a quenching of excited molecules before they have time to react with oxygen, it is easy to produce plausible (but yet unproved) explanations of the absence of effects of the ions under some conditions. At high water contents a water conditioned decay of triplets m a y mask that caused by the paramagnetic ions. A masking effect m a y also be at hand at high oxygen tensions, oxygen being, apart from its peroxy and peroxide forming ability, an extremely efficient quencher of excited molecules. Absence of the influence of paramagnetic ions under anoxic conditions is also comprehensible considering that harmful peroxides can not be produced, either by direct reaction of oxygen and excited triplet, or from free .radicals, the seeds being soaked in oxygen-free water immediately after irradiation. In their extremely careful experiments with bacterium spores, permitting very small experimental errors, POWERS et al.(21) find N O and 02, when present during irradiation, to enhance the radiation sensitivity by some 20 per cent compared to the effects obtained when these gases are added immediately after irradiation in an N z or He atmosphere. T h e y refer this effect to a "Class I I d a m a g e " which might be caused by a quenching action of the paramagnetic molecules on luminescence, i.e., on excited molecules. It should be pointed out that in the present experiments with plant seeds, the action of the paramagnetic ions is opposite to the effect observed by POWERS et al.~~1) Discrepancies of this kind must be further elucidated before generally valid interpretations can be formulated. The concentration of M n 2 + in the seeds after

4 hr soaking in a 0.2 NI solution, a treatment which clearly decreased the radiation sensitivity of the seeds, was determined by activation analysis to make the embryos about 0"05 M with respect to total manganese--i.e, about forty times the normal concentration.(s) Assuming the quenching efficiency of Mn 2+ to be 100-1000 times less than that of molecules in radiationinduced triplet states such as triplet naphthalene,(19) the presence of the M n 2+ ions will correspond to the same amount of paramagnetic centers as that produced by an irradiation, in every moment, with about 10,000 rad of y-radiation. T h e Mn 2 + effect will therefore be sufficient to support an explanation, on the basis of a quenching of excited molecules, of the decrease of the effectiveness of y-irradiation with increasing dose rate.Or) Acknowledgements--The authors are grateful to the Scientific Bureau of the Japanese Government for the award of a fellowship to K.
