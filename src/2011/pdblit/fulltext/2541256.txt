We present a calculation of the relative changes in binding free energy between the complex of ribonuclease T, (RNase T,) with its inhibitor 2'-guanosine monophosphate (B'GMP) and that of RNase T,-2'-adenosine monophosphate (2'AMP) by means of a thermodynamic perturbation method implemented with molecular dynamics. Using the available crystal structure of the RNase T,-B'GMP complex, the structure of the RNase T,-2'AMP complex was obtained as a final structure of the perturbation calculation. The calculated difference in was 2.76 kcal/mol. This compares well with the the free energy of binding (AAG,& value of 3.07 kcal/mol. The encouraging agreement in AAGbind suggests that experimental tbe interactions of inhibitors with the enzyme are reasonably represented. Energy component analyses of the two complexes reveal that the active site of RNase T, electrostatically stabilizes the binding of S'GMP more than that of 2'AMP by 44 kcal/mol, are similar in the two complexes. The analyses suggest while the van der Waals' interactions that the mutation from Glu46 to Gln may lead to a preference of RNase T, for adenine in contrast to the guanine preference of the wild-type enzyme. Although the molecular dynamics equilibration moves the atoms of the RNase T,-2'GMP of the G to A in the active system about 0.9 A from their X-ray positions and the mutation site increases the deviation from the X-ray structure, the mutation of the A back to G reduces the deviation. This and the agreement found for AAG,ind suggest that the molecular dynamics/free energy perturbation method will be useful for both energetic and structural interactions. analysis of protein-ligand

I. Introduction RNase T, from the fungus Aspergillus oryzae degrades single-stranded RNA by a reaction mechanism involving formation of an intermediate 2' to 3' cyclic phosphate followed by hydrolysis to yield a terminal 3'.phosphate (Sato & Egami, 1957). This stable and acidic enzyme contains 104 amino acid residues (Takahashi, 1971, 1985). This enzyme is specific for guanylic acid residues as the site of hydrolysis of RNA, namely it cleaves the phosphodiester bonds of RNA specifically at the 3'-end of guanosine (Egami et al., 1980). The rate of hydrolysis of dinueleotide monophosphates by RNase T1 is only mildly affected by the nature of the neighboring base (Takahashi, 1965; Irie, 1968). In contrast, RNase A is strongly influenced by the nature of the base adjacent to the point of hydrolytic attack (Witzel & Barnard, 1962), which means that RNase T, specifically recognizes one base in the RNA (Campbell & Ts'o, 1971). B'GMP acts as inhibitor for the hydrolysis reaction of RNase T,. 197

RNase T1 has been the target of extensive biochemical and biophysical research, a,nd threeco-ordinates and thermodynamic data dimensional are available for the complex of this protein with its inhibitors (Egami et aZ., 1980; Takahashi & M.oore, 1982). The three-dimensional structure of the complex has been determined by RNase T,-B'GMP X-ray crystallography at 1.9 A (1 A = 8.1 nm) resolution (lrnt: registered in the Protein Data Bank) (Heinemann & Saenger, 1982; Sugio et al., 1985; Arni et al., 1987, 1988). Dissociation constants (Kd) of the 2'GMP and 2'AMP complexes with RNase T, have been measured to be 2.4 x lop5 and 4.3 x lop3 at pH 50, 25"C, respectively (Campbell & Ts'o, 1971; Egami et al., 1980). It appeared to us that RNase T, was an ideal model with which to begin examining the basis for protein-nucleic acid interactions and their specificity. It is smaller and computationally more tractable than repressor or endonuclease-DNA complexes and, yet, has a substantial selectivity. To calculate relative binding specificities, we made

cycle-perturbation use of the thermodynamic method (Zwanzig, 1954), which involves changing the molecular mechanical parameters during the molecular dynamics simulation and determining the free energy change for the process (Postma et al., 1982; Tembe & McCammon, 1984; Lybrand et al., 1986; Singh et al., 1987). Figure 1 shows a simplified mechanism for enzyme-inhibitor complex formation involving T, binding of B'GMP and B'AMP. The difference in binding free energy for the two inhibitors to the enzyme is AAGbind = AG, -AC,. The processes shown in Figure 1 that involve horizontal arrows are straightforward to measure experimentally, but difficult to study by molecular dynamics/ free energy methods. AG, and AG, were determined constants (AC: = -RT In from the dissociation (l/K,)) and are -6.30 kcal/mol and -3.23 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4184 J), respectively. The processes represented by the vertical arrows, which although not physically measurable, are straightforward to simulate. As free energy is a state function, the results of computer simulations can be related to AAGbind = is the change in free energy AGbind - AGso~solv. AGso~solv upon mutating the inhibitor B'GMP to B'AMP in water. This quantity is the relative free energy of solvation of the two inhibitors in water. AGbi,d is the change in free energy for the same mutation with the inhibitor bound to the enzyme. AGsO1, and AGbind were calculated by the thermodynamic perturbation method and the difference, AAGbind, was compared with the experimental value of AGz - AG,

The characterization of states A and B, and calculation of interaction energies, are done with an empirical force field (Weiner et al., 1984, 1986), using the software AMBER 3.0 (Weiner & Kollman, 1981; Singh et al., 1986). The AMBER program automatically carries out &he transformation between the 2 states, name1 y 2'GMP(I = 1) and 2'AMP(3,=0), during which intermediate energy values for each interval are accumulated, stored and reported. The GIBBS program for free energy calculations and the methodology have been described in more detail (Singh et al., 1987; Bash et al., 1987a; Kollman et al., 1987; Rao et al., 1987). The entire inhibitor is used as the "perturbed group". The first calculation was to determine the difference in solvation free energy between the 2 inhibitors (AG,,,,): and the second was to determine the difference in the free between the 2 inhibitor-enzyme complexes energy (AG,,&. The difference (AGbind- AGsolv)is equal to the difference in aqueous solution binding free energies of the 2 inhibitors, AAGbind.The BAGbindhas been estimated to be 3.07 kcal/mol from the dissociation constants determined experimentally. The 2'GMP inhibitor, in its initial conformation taken from the X-ray structure of the complex, was placed in a box of 605 TIP3P water molecules (Jorgensen et al.; 1983) generated by a Monte Carlo simulation. The system was optimized using energy minimization until the root-meansquare value of the energy gradients was below @05 kcal/(mol A). After that, the system was equilibrated using molecular dynamics for 8 ps at constant temperature and pressure using periodic boundary conditions (Berendsen et al., 1984) with SHAKE (Van Gunsteren i?r. Berendsen, 1977) to constrain all bond lengths to their equilibrium values. The free energy perturbation was carried out in a series of 20 windows with da. = -@OFi. At q?ch 1, 500 steps of equilibration (0002 ps time steps) are followed by 500 steps of data collection (0002 ps time steps). The initial state for the complex was the X-say structure of the RNase T,-2'GMP complex crystallized at pH 4.4. The side-chain atoms of Glu102 (Cp: C', 0" and 0"`) are not included in the lrnt co-ordinate set, due to disorder. We set their initial Cartesian co-ordinates using the internal co-ordinates of Glu in the AMBER data base (Weiner et al., 1984, 1986). B'GMP binds to RNase T, in a C2'-endo-syn conformation. Histidines 27, 40 and 92 were designated to be in a protonated + I charge state in accordance with experimental evidence (Riiterjans & Pongs, 1971; Arata et aE., 1979). All Lys and Arg residues were positively charged and Glu and Asp residues negatively charged. The phosphate of 2'GMP was given a net charge of -1.0 and the atomic charges that are different from those in the AMBER data base are the anionic phosuhates of the inhibitor IP: + l-420.

and P. A. Kollman The calculation in the enzyme system was performed in a similar manner as the solution system. The resultant free energy changes of the RNase T,-2'GMP complex are 1045 kcal/mol (+) -11.46 kcal/mol (-) for A-+B, and and - 10.66 kcal/mol ( +) and 8.65 kcal/mol (- ) for B-A. The average is 163Oi 1.19. The average for the free energy changes of the inhibitor in the enzyme and in solution for both A-+B and B-+A is 2.76(*@67) kcal/mol, and the experimental value for this pair is 3.07 kcal/mol. The quality of agreement is quite good, if one considers the complexity of the calculation. Table 1 summarizes calculated and experimental free energy changes and the meaning of the error limit,s. It is not clear what is the best/most realistic way to estimate the error. One finds the error limits of &- 0.67 quoted above by comparing matched pairs in the solution and enzyme simulations. On the other band, separate summing of the errors in the solution and enzyme simulations and dividing by h/2 gives an error estimate of + 1%3, and using all 16 differences in Table 1 gives Ifr 1.68. There is a reason for favoring the matched pairs and it has to do with the likely similarity of hydrogen-bonding interactions of G in various environments and of A in various environments. As one mutates G-+A there will be errors associated with going through nrtistatistical fieial states that involve neither good hydrogen bond donating nor good accepting, and correctly sampling these is a challenge. Such sampling errors will be minimized in the determination of AA@ if matched pairs are used. Nonetheless, we do not consider the argument for using matched pairs as watertight, so that the true uncertainty in the free energy may be + 1.68 or f 1.88 kcal/mol. (b) Interactions RNase T,

force field parameters (Weiner et al., 1984). Furthermore, to include the effects of solvation, we add a spherical "cap" of 218 water molecules within 15 A of the Cl' atom of Z'GMP, and harmonic radial forces restrained (@6 kcal/(mol 8')) any water leaving this 15 L% boundary (Brooks et aZ., 1985). The complex was also optimized
using energy minimization until the root-mean-square value of the potential gradients was below 605 kcal/(mol 8). Next, it was equilibrated using molecular dynamics for 8 ps at constant temperature with

SHAKE. The free energy perturbation was carried out in a series of 20 windows with dL = -0-05. At each 1, 500 steps of equilibration (0002 ps time steps) are followed by 500 steps of data collection (0002 ps time steps). The
protocol for the simulations is summarized in Fig. 2.

3. Results
(a,) Binding free energy change

The interaction energy of the inhibitor with the solvent at values of its parameters (L+dL) and (,LdA) were evaluated and designated as ( + ) and (-), respectively. This provided an internal check on the method, since the sum of these two energy changes over all the intervals should be identical. The resultant free energy changes are 8.36 kcal/mol (+) and -904 kcal/mol (-). Using the final coordinates from the A+ B simulation, we equilibrated the system for eight picoseconds using the AMBER GIBBS routine. After that, we carried out a second run for the B+A transition with resultant ( + ) and free energy changes of - 7-02 kcal/mol 575 kcal/mol ( -). This inverse transformation was done to check the dependency of the result on the starting configuration. The changes from A-+B and R+ A occurred over a total period of 80 picoseconds. The average of the free energy changes in solution is 7.54( + 1.46) kcal/mol. The solvation free energy changes for guanine -+ adenine is calculated to be 6.95 F 0.54 (Bash et al., 1987b). These values are in good agreement and the difference in the values, 96 kcal/mol, could be due to the presence of the sugar and phosphate groups in the current simulation, although both values are equivalent within the statistical errors. In any case, it is clear that the desolvation of B'GMP is much more difficult than that of B'AMP.

We obtained a structure of the RNase Tr-YAM model complex as a final structure of the free energy calculation beginning with the crystal structure of the RNase T,-B'GMP complex. Table 2 shows a root-mean-square (r.m.s.7) deviation of each complex structure from the X-ray structure.

The side-chain atoms of Asn43, Ser72, Asn98 and Asn99 had large deviations from the X-ray structure. These atoms moved to form hydrogen bonds to water molecules and have different geometries from those in the X-ray structure. The main chain of the enzyme and the inhibitor molecule in RNase T,-B'GMP (2 = 1 structure) was quite similar to that in the X-ray structure. RNase T,-2'AMP and RNase T,-2'GMP (2 = O+ (a = 1 +O structure) 1 structure) are the averaged structures of four picoseeonds of molecular dynamics after the forward GIBBS calculation and backward GIBBS calculation, respectively. The r.m.s. deviation of RNase T,-B'AMP (2 = 1 -+O structure) was 0.928 A. The base moiety of 2'AMP and the side-chain atoms of Asn36, Asn43, Glu46, Ser72, Va178, Asn98 and Asn99 of the complex have large deviations, while the main chain of the enzyme does not show large movement. The r.m.s. deviation (9909 A) of RNase Ti-B'GMP (A = 0-t 1 structure) is larger than that of the J = 1 structure, but is smaller than that of the RNase T,-Z'AMP structure. The r.m.s. deviations of RNase T,-2'AMP (2 = structure) and RNase T,-2'GMP(I = O-+ 1 structure) from RNase T,-S'GMP (A= 1 structure) are also shown in Table 2. The r.m.s. deviation of the /z = O-+ 1 structure from the 1= 1 structure is quit,e small (0.367 A). Thus, it appears that the

perturbation of the structure carried out here is reasonably reversible. The model structure of RNase T,-B'AMP (2 = 1 +O structure) is possibly correct because the binding free energy change of the RNase T,-2'GMP complex compares well with the experimental value. Thus, we have a, reasonable candidate for the geometry of 2'AMP binding to RNase T, and it will be interesting to see how accurate this turns out to be when more extensive experiments have been done. A referee has noted that our use of a,n anionic charge distribution of Glu58 may be incorrect, particularly at the pH of the crystal structure (4.4) or of the enzyme inhibition study (50), and given the experiments of Iida & Ooi (1969), which show that the pK, of one carboxylate group is shifted from 4.9 to 7.8 on binding of 2'GMP, and the crystal structure, which shows a short Glu58-phosphate distance. The experimental results are not unequivocal, however, as to whether Glu58 or the phosphate of the inhibitor bears the proton in the hydrogen bond. Instead of protonating the Glu, we used a phosphate group with a - 1 rather than -2 charge and the OH of the phosphate was a proton donor to Glu58 (Figs 7 and 8). Since the pKa of secondary phosphate ionization of AMP is 6.67 and et al., 1965) and the that of GMP is 6.66 (Phillips distance between OE2 of Glu58 and OlP of 2'GMP is 2.38 A in the X-ray structure of the RNase T,-B'GMP complex, assignment of the proton to the phosphate group of the inhibitor seems reasonable. Although our proton location may not be correct, it does allow the hydrogen bond between the phosphate and carboxylate, and the same net charge for the pair. Furthermore, given the distance between Glu58 and the base, it is very unlikely that changing state will have a profound effect on its protonation the AAG value calculated. We calculated the interaction energies of B'GMP and 2'AMP with their surroundings in the water agreement in AAG and/or enzyme. The encouraging suggests that the interactions of inhibitors with the enzyme are reasonably described, although there is no guarantee that it is not a fortuitous cancellation of errors. The final values for the energy and its components are presented in Table 3. It is seen that the total interaction energy of B'GMP with the surrounding water in the aqueous system is - 325 kcal/mol (non-bonded van der Waals' energy: - 23.5, electrostatic energy: - 292~7, hydrogen-

more difficult than that of B'AMP (AGSolV = 7.54 kcal/mol). How are these positive interaction energy values consistent with the negative free energies of binding observed experimentally for both inhibitors! What has been left out of these analyses is the change in solvent-solvent (solution) and internal protein energies (enzyme) upon inhibitor solvation and binding. For typical solvation interaction of ions, the attractive water-solute interaction is balanced by an increase in water-water energies upon solvation that is about half as large in magnitude as the water-solute interaction energies. In fact, we have pointed out that the unfavorable water-water energies upon solvation, in contrast to the smaller increase in internal macromolecule energy upon binding, is the key driving force for ligand macromolecular association and catalysis (Bash et al., 1987b; Caldwell & Kollman, unpublished results). The averaged structure of the RNase T,-2'GMP complex during eight picoseconds of molecular dynamics is shown in Figures 3 and 4. This averaged structure is similar to the crystal structure (r.m.s. deviation = 0.873 8). Tn the RNase T,-B'GMP complex, the hydrogen bonding potential of the guanine base is completely saturated. In addition to tbe hydrogen bonding, the base of 2'GMP is interposed between the phenolic side-chains of Tyr42 and Tyr45. The phenolic rings approach the base at angles of about 20" and 40", respectively. The binding mode of Z'GMP is shown schematically in Figure 5 and the hydrogen bonding distances are listed in Table 4. The model of 2'AMP binding to RNase T,, as observed in the averaged structure of the complex

after molecular dynamics perturbatioa runs, is shown in Figures 6 and 7: and is quite different from the RNase T,-2'GMP complex. In t)he RNase T,-S'AMP complex, the hydrogen bonding potential of the adenine base is not saturated and the base of

2'AMP is no longer interposed between the phenolic side-chains of Tyr42 and Tyr45. Angles of the phenolic rings and the adenine base are about 55" and 75", respectively. S'AMP binds to RNase T, in a rotated orientation of about 35" compared with B'GMP. The binding mode of B'AMP is shown schein Figure 8, and the hydrogen bonding matically distances are listed in Table 5. Hydrogen bonds between the base of S'AMP and residues Asn44, Tyr45 and Glu46 do not exist. These hydrogen to be important for substrate bonds are thought recognition by RNase T, (Heinemann & Saenger, 1982; Arni et al.: 1988). Instead, two additional hydrogen bonds between 2'AMP and the protein are formed. One is HN6 to Tyr42 (OH) and the other is 03P to Asn36 (HN6), which does not exist in the RNase T,-2'GMP complex. In any case, it is clear that the interaction of 2'AMP with RNase T, is weaker than that of 2'GMP. (c) Interaction energy decomposition contributing group by

van der Waals' interaction energies between Z'GMP and B'AMP (see Table 6). The differences depend mainly on the changes of interaction of the base moiety with Tyr42 and Tyr45, which result from t,he lack of stacking between the adenine base of B'AMP and phenolic rings of Tyr42 and Tyr45. But this in van der Waals' interaction energy difference between 2'GMP and B'AMP is still only 1.7 kcallmol.

residues in the active site of RNase T, interacted more favorably with B'GMP than B'AMP by about 44 kcal/mol. The difference is mainly due to the electrostatic and hydrogen bonding energies. The understanding of solvation and desolvation of nucleic acids is critical as well as that of stabilization energies if the intermolecular interactions of are to be described nucleic acids with enzymes (Bash et al., 19876; Caldwell & Kollman, 1988). A comparison has been made between the molecular mechanical interaction energy of deoxyguanosine $-phosphate (dGMP) and deoxythymidine 5'-phosphate (dTMP) with staphylococcal nuclease (Caldwell & Kollman, unpublished results). The calculations have shown that it is more difficult to desolvate guanine than thymine by 11% kcal/mol,

although dGMP interacts more strongly with the enzyme by about 6 kcal/mol. This has been thought to be the reason why dTMP is a better inhibitor of the enzyme than dGMP. In contrast to staphylococcal nuclease, RNase T, binds B'GMP by 3 kcaljmol more strongly than B'AMP, although it requires about 8 kcal/mol more free energy to desolvate B'GMP than S'AMP. RNase T, seems to be well suited to stabilize preferentially the binding of guanine.

duce the experimental difference in free energy of binding of a 2'GMP inhibitor compared to 2'AMP (calculated : 2-76 k 0.67 (or f 1.68); experimental: 3.07 keal/mol). Although this is not the first successful reproduction of AAGbind by this method, the challenge posed by this mutation is considerably greater than substitution of a single functional group or the substitution of a hydrogen bonding one. Here we amino acid by a smaller, hydrophobic repiace a nucleic acid base (G) that forms seven hydrogen bonds to protein with another (A) with similar hydrogen bond potentiality but with extensive alterations of the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor functionality. Thus, the A base forms only three hydrogen bonds to the protein. However, the large loss of about, 10 kcal/mol of free energy of interactions in the protein when G is mutated to A is modulated by a difference of about 7 kcal/mol in solvation free energy. Guanine has a much larger dipole moment than adenine and is thus expected to interact significantly more strongly with water. A referee has suggested that. one run the perturbations longer to assess further statistical errors. This has been done for smaller systems (Singh et al., 1987) and the simulation protocol employed here gave little statistical error in the methanol -+ ethane mutation. The perturbation done here involved much larger changes, so it would be expected to require much longer runs to achieve the free energies of errors (about 0.3 kcal/mol) found for methanol + ethane. This does not appear to us to be warranted because the protein simulation would probably require even longer simulations to ensure convergence to that accuracy. The actual AGsolv has been calculated to be about 7 kcal/mol when 2'GMP was mutated to P'AMP. The same value was obtained

for the calculation of just the bases (Bash et al., 19876), which provides an independent confirmation of the correctness of the solution AGsolV being about 7 kcal/mol. The difference between the two calculations is small and within the statist,ical error. This is further encouraging support for the previous predictions and also suggests that the effect of sugar and phosphate on relative base solvation is small. The suggestion is intuitively reasonable, given latter solvation group additivity considerations. It is not clear that this will always be the case when highly polar and charged groups such as sugar and phosphate are involved. From the point of view of protein structure, our simulations predict the structure of the RNase complex (Figs 5, 6 and 8). It, is particuT,-B'AMP larly encouraging that the molecular dynamics simulations are at least able to restore some of the properties of the X-ray crystal structure of the RNase T,-B'GMP complex; i.e. the final structure after mutation of the complex to 2'AMP and back again to 2'GMP was closer to the original X-ray structure than to the B'AMP structure intermediate in the perturbation calculation. This is further supported by comparing t`he simulated structures (second column in Table 2) in which the interRNase T,-B'AMP structure was 0,756 A mediate from the equilibrated RNase T,-2'GMP and the final RNase T,-S'GMP structure deviated by only 0.367 A. Thus, although the molecular dynamics simulations have certainly moved t,be atom positions from those observed in the X-ray structure, and the mutation of 2'GMP -+ 2'AMP has caused further distortions in the active site of the enzyme, the reverse mutation has restored some of the features of t,he original structure. Thus, although

208

our force field and simulat,ion protocol are far from ideal, they are able to simulate experimental reality in a qualitative way. Improvements in force fields, longer simulation time and more complete environmental representations will be subjects of future research, but, we think, the simulations presented here have "stretched the boundaries" for successful and useful applications of free energy perturbation calculations in protein-ligand systems. Our simulations also have a more general message in the development of our understanding of protein-nucleic acid interactions. As one can see, RNase T, acquires its guanine specificity because its active site has a 10 kcal/mol stronger free energy of interaction with a G than an A base, which compensates for the 7 kcal/mol difference in solvation free energy. It is obvious that one should be able to design an A-specific protein with much higher selectivity than a G-specific protein. In fact, a purely hydrophobic binding pocket would be expected to bind A better than G by about IO', because of the greater ease of desolvation of A. From the point of view of a base specificity, it is interesting to compare the amino acid sequences of several ribonucleases. Figure 9 shows the amino acid sequences of RNase T,, U1, M, and UZ (Takahashi, 1965, 1971, 1985; Sato & Uchida, 1975; Watanabe et al., 1982; Kanaya & Uchida, 1986; Takahashi & Hashimoto, 1988). The asterisks indicate the hydrogen-bonding residues to B'GMP or 2'AMP observed in our free energy calculations RNase U, (from Ustilago sphaerogena) is a guanine-specific RNase like RNase T, (Hashimoto et al., 1971; Kenny & Dekker, 1971). RNase M, (from the mould Aspergillus saitoi, EC 3.1.4.23) has been shown to cleave at all four nucleatides, with some preference for guanosine (Ohgi & Irie, 1975; Irie & Ohgi, 1976). RNase UZ (from Ustilago sphaerogena) is purine-specific, but unlike the other ribonucleases, it prefers an adenine to a guanine (Sato & Uchida, 1975; Kanaya & Uchida, 1986). The residues involved in catalysis, His40, Glu58, Arg77 and His92 (Takahashi & Moore, 1982) are all well conserved in the four ribonucleases (Hashimoto et al., 1973; Hashimoto & Takahashi: 1977; Takahashi & Hashimoto, 1988). The region from residues 42 to 51 is especially noticeable in that the sequences are identical between RNases Tl and U,, which are guanine-specific, whereas the sequence of RNase M,, which is mainly guaninespecific but still has a small adenine specificity, is partially different and that of RNase U,, which is mainly adenine-specific, is quite different. Since this difference should not be due to a species difference, it has been suggested that it is related to the functional difference. In particular, residues 42 to 46 are thought to be involved in the recognition of bases from X-ray crystallographic bY ribonucleases, studies (Heinema'nn & Saenger, 1982; Sugio et al., 1985) and our calculations" We mentioned that among the residues Glu46 interacts most favorably with the base of Z'GMP, whereas it interacts unfavorably with the base of Z'AMP because the side-chain of Glu46 is repulsive to the N atom at the

adenine 1 position. The residue of RNase UZ is Ala46, which would not give a specific interaction with either adenine or guanine. However, because of the relative solvation free energies alone, the mutation from Glu46 to Ala could lead RNase T, to an adenine specificity. Furthermore, the mut'ation from Glu46 to Gln is expected to lead to a, side-chain that would form a hydrogen bond to the base of Z'AMP and whose NH, would form a repulsive interaction with the guanine Nl-H or BNH,. The residues 44 and 45 are observed to be close to an amino group at the adenine 6 position in the RNase T,-B'AMP complex obt,ained from our calculations. It is thus interesting that the residues of RNase U, are Asp44 and Glu45, which have hydrogen bond acceptor functionalities. Whether these cause this region of the protein to flip and the side-chains to point toward the inhibitor remains to be seen. In any case, mutating Glu46, which contributes significantly to the G preference, will certainly generate an enzyme that is less G-specific and may generate an enzyme t,hat is significantly A-specific, although the backbone NH groups of Asn44 and Tyr45 "ay stil favor a C=O at the purine 6 position. In a more general sense, our analysis of solvation and binding issues may be relevant to the consideration of specific binding to DNA by proteins such as Cro (Anderson et al., 1981; Ohlendorf et al., 1982), CAP (McKay & Steitz, 1981; McKay et al., 1982), lambda (Jordan & Pabo, 1988) and Trp (Schevitz et al., 1985; Lawson et al., 1988) repressors, and B%oRI endonuclease (McClarin et al., 1986), etc. One can easily imagine getting AT preferences at operator sites without, any specific protein-DNA interactions, given that desolvation will be much less costly in energy for AT than GC sequences. On the almost certainly other hand, a GC preference suggests a specific protein-DNA contact.
