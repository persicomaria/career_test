Abstract--A series of xanthine mimetics containing 5,5 and 5,6 heterocycle fused imidazoles were synthesized as dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors. Compound 7 is potent (h-DPPIV Ki = 2 nM) and exhibits excellent selectivity and no species specificity against rat and human enzymes. The X-ray structure confirms that the binding mode of 7 to rat DPPIV is similar to the parent xanthines. Ó 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The incretin hormones glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) play an important role in glucose homeostasis with effects on the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, muscle tissue, and brain.1,2 GLP-1 enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from the b-cells of the pancreas,3 promotes insulin biosynthesis,4 and inhibits postprandial glucagon secretion.5 Administration of GLP-1 reduces the rate of gastric emptying,6 suppresses appetite and, importantly, promotes b-cell mass.7 Exenatide, a potent GLP-1 mimetic administered subcutaneously, is currently approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes.8 Under physiological conditions, the incretin effect is brief because of the short half-life of the incretin hormones due to the action of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) enzyme. DPPIV is a serine protease that cleaves a dipeptide from the N-terminus of the active form of GLP-1, GIP, neuropeptides, and chemokines, and renders them inactive. This discovery has led to the development of DPPIV inhibitors to increase the half-life of circulating incretin hormones and normalize glucose homeostasis.9 DPPIV has now become a validated target with several small molecule inhibitors in late stage clinical trials for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.10

DPPIV inhibitors can be broadly categorized into peptidic and non-peptidic series, with a majority of the inhibitors that have successfully advanced to late stage trials being of peptidyl origin.10 DPPIV inhibitors related to xanthines include purine, uracil, imidazole, pyrimidine, and pyridine analogs.11 Each of these subclasses serves as a core to direct key peripheral groups in a direction important to maintain several points of contact needed for potent DPPIV inhibition. Takeda San Diego (formerly Syrrx) recently disclosed SYR-322 which bears a central uracil moiety.12 SYR-322 was reported to be in phase III clinical trials making it likely that compounds in this class will play an important role in DPPIV inhibition and type 2 diabetes therapy (Fig. 1). A high throughput screen of the Abbott library of compounds for potential DPPIV inhibitors revealed several xanthine analogs exhibiting low micromolar potency

for the enzyme. Preliminary SAR on the xanthine revealed that N-7 alkylation of the xanthine moiety was needed, preferably with a (2-cyano) benzyl group. Substitution at the 8-position was also required with 3amino piperidine being optimal. N-1 substitution was tolerated but not required. A protein X-ray crystallographic study of the most potent screening lead 6,13 bound within the active site of rat DPPIV, was in accordance with these early SAR observations.14 Groups at the 7- and 8-positions of the xanthine ring system made specific protein contacts. In addition, a hydrogen bond between the 6-carbonyl oxygen and the backbone N­H of Tyr 632 of the protein was observed. Positions 1 and 2 were in close proximity to the protein but had no direct interaction, while N-3 and N-9 appeared to be in a large solvent pocket (Fig. 2). Based on the X-ray data, we embarked on a synthetic program which targeted xanthine analogs that retain the imidazole and 6-carbonyl moieties but possess alternative A-ring heterocycles. We envisioned that such a change would still enable the core to orient the vital N-7 benzylic and the C-8 (3-amino)-piperidine pharmacophores in a similar direction as the xanthine to maintain potent DPPIV inhibition while providing the flexibility to modulate the pharmacokinetic properties of the compounds. To aid the medicinal chemistry strategy, a convergent procedure was developed to obtain 5,5 and 5,6 ring fused xanthine mimetics. A Cu1 mediated cyclization utilizing the acyclic guanidine derived from 3-amino piperidine was the key step (Scheme 1).15 Alkyl-

ation at N-7 and deprotection provided DPPIV inhibitor 6. Related fused imidazole compounds were synthesized by similar procedures. The in vitro activity of the compounds was tested against human and rat DPPIV enzyme. Data for selected compounds are shown in Table 1. Xanthine 6 with an ortho-cyano benzyl group off the imidazole (N-7) nitrogen was extremely potent (h-DPPIV Ki = 2 nM). The potency is retained when the A ring of the xanthine is replaced with a methyl maleimide as in 7 (h-DPPIV Ki = 2 nM) or methyl pyridazinone as in 8 (h-DPPIV Ki = 5 nM). The ortho-cyano group can be substituted with small electron-withdrawing groups such as a chloro as in 9 (h-DPPV Ki = 9 nM) or trifluoromethyl as in 10 (h-DPPIV Ki = 10 nM) with a 5-fold loss in potency. Larger groups such as a trifluoromethoxy as in 11 (h-DPPIV Ki = 22 nM) are less desirable with a 10-fold loss in DPPIV activity compared to 7. Notably human DPPIV inhibition is dramatically weakened when the ortho-cyano group is moved to the meta-position as in 12 (h-DPPIV Ki = 1200 nM). Modeling of meta-substituents indicated that a meta acetonitrile as in 13 would allow the cyano group to reorient to be similar to 8. As modeling predicted, potency was re-established with 13 (h-DPPIV Ki = 11 nM). The SAR indicates that both the benzylic moiety and a small electron-withdrawing group (EWG) are important for potent DPPIV inhibition and the optimum orientation for the protein­ inhibitor interaction is when the small EWG is at the ortho-position of the aryl group. Extended groups at the A ring are less desirable. For example, benzyl maleimide as in 14 (h-DPPIV Ki = 29 nM) was less potent than methyl maleimide 7. Similarly naphthoquinone as in 15 (h-DPPIV Ki = 25 nM) was less potent than 7. Not all heterocyclic substitutions at the A ring were tolerated. Substitution of the C-6 carbonyl of the uracil moiety of 6 with a fluoro group as in 16 (h-DPPIV Ki = 57 nM) diminished potency while a pyridine N-oxide as in 17 (h-DPPIV Ki = 300 nM) was weakly active. The location of the C-6 carbonyl group relative to the benzyl moiety off the imidazole is also critical. For example when the ortho-cyano benzyl group is attached to the imidazole N-9 nitrogen distal to the carbonyl of the pyridazinone as in 18 (h-DPPIV Ki = 260 nM) the potency decreased sharply.

The X-ray structure of 7 bound to rat DPPIV (pdb code 2I3Z) assisted in further rationalizing the SAR by revealing critical binding features necessary for potent DPPIV inhibition (Fig. 3). Analysis of the crystal structure revealed that the 3-amino piperidine was in an ideal position to interact with Glu 203 and Glu 204. The maleimide was oriented to form a p stacking interaction with Tyr 548. The ortho-cyano benzyl group is in the vicinity of Ser 631 (the catalytically active serine in DPPIV). Unlike the cyano pyrrolidine DPPIV inhibitors that have been reported in the literature14,16 there was no direct interaction between the nitrile of 7 and the hydroxyl group of Ser 631. However, the nitrile is being directed to a shallow hydrophobic pocket in P114 increasing the inhibitor­protein interaction. This result possibly explains the similar potencies observed when

the nitrile was replaced with a chloro or trifluoromethyl group as in 9 and 10 (Table 1). The crystal structure depicts the benzyl group to be orthogonal to the plane of the heterocycle. It is likely that steric and electronic properties of the adjacent carbonyl of the maleimide are contributing to the orthogonality of the benzyl group as predicted by AM1 modeling. Methyl maleimide, 7, seems to be optimum and larger groups or extensions may be in the way of the protein, as demonstrated by the diminished potency of 14 and 15. Compound 7 was unstable in rat plasma and showed a poor pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in Sprague­Dawley

fused imidazoles. Compound 7 was found to be a potent and selective DPPIV inhibitor, but it showed a significant loss of activity in the presence of plasma. Compound 20 showed minimal potency changes in the presence of plasma. Hence the shift in potency of 7 was attributed to plasma instability and not protein binding. X-ray analysis of 7 bound to DPPIV indicates that the binding mode is similar to the parent xanthine 6. Xanthine mimetics allowed us to unravel the key structural features important for potent DPPIV activity while providing good selectivity and no species specificity enabling them to be studied in rodent models of diabetes. These attributes make them excellent compounds to study DPPIV inhibition in vivo as well as assist in designing future DPPIV inhibitors based on this important class of heterocycles.

rats with a high clearance rate and low oral bioavailability. We reasoned that the low plasma stability was partly due to the electrophilicity of the carbonyl groups which made the maleimide susceptible to nucleophilic attack. In an attempt to make more stable DPPIV inhibitors, 7 was reacted with either N-methyl amine to convert the A ring to the ring opened diamide 19 or reacted with N,N 0 -dimethylhydrazine to prepare the corresponding pyridazine dione 20 (Scheme 2). Compounds 7, 19, and 20 were tested against human and rat DPPIV enzyme in the presence of 2% and 18% rat plasma to study the effects of plasma stability on DPPIV inhibition (Table 2). Xanthine 6, maleimide 7, and pyridazinedione 20 did not show species specificity against human and rat DPPIV enzymes in the absence of plasma. Xanthine 6 is stable in rat plasma with a mere 2-fold shift in potency in the presence of 18% rat plasma (r-DPPIV Ki = 3­7 nM). Confirming the PK and plasma instability result, a significant shift in potency was observed for 7 against DPPIV in the absence of plasma (r-DPPIV Ki = 2 nM) compared to 18% rat plasma (rDPPIV Ki = 600 nM). The ring opened analog 19 was weak against h-DPPIV. The ring expanded product 20 was 5-fold less potent than 7 (h-DPPIV Ki = 11 nM). However, the compound was stable in rat plasma without a significant shift in potency in the presence of plasma (r-DPPIV Ki = 17­24 nM in 18% plasma). Human peptidases including DPP7, DPP8, DPP9, and POP are structurally or functionally related to DPPIV and most importantly inhibition of DPP8 and/or DPP9 is associated with significant toxicity.17 The compounds were screened and found to be inactive against these isozymes (Table 3). In summary, we have discovered novel, potent, and selective xanthine mimetics based on 5,5 and 5,6 ring
