Two major glycoforms of recombinant antithrombin which differ 10-fold in their affinity for the effector glycosaminoglycan, heparin, were previously shown to be expressed in BHK or CHO mammalian cell lines (I. Bjork, et al., 1992, Biochem. J. 286, 793­800; B. Fan ¨ et al., 1993, J. Biol. Chem. 268, 17588­17596). To determine the source of the glycosylation heterogeneity responsible for these different heparin-affinity forms, each of the four Asn residue sites of glycosylation, residues 96, 135, 155, and 192, was mutated to Gln to block glycosylation at these sites. Heparin-agarose chromatography of the four antithrombin variants revealed that Gln 96, Gln 135, and Gln 192 variants still displayed the two functional heparin-affinity forms previously observed with the wild-type inhibitor, whereas the Gln 155 variant showed only a single functional high heparin affinity form. These results demonstrate that heterogeneous glycosylation of Asn 155 of recombinant antithrombin is responsible for generating the low heparin affinity glycoform. Analysis of heparin binding to the higher heparin affinity forms of the four variants showed that all exhibited increased heparin affinities of two- to sevenfold compared to wild-type higher heparin affinity form or to plasma antithrombin, with the Gln 135 variant showing the largest effect on this affinity. The extent of heparin-affinity enhancement was correlated with the distance of the mutated glycosylation site to the putative heparin-binding site in the X-ray structure of antithrombin. All variants dis1 This work was supported in part by National Institutes of Health Grant HL-39888 (to S.T.O.) and by Swedish Medical Research Council Grant 4212 and EU Biomed 2 Grant BMH4-CT96-0937 (to I.B.). 2 To whom correspondence should be addressed.

played normal kinetics of thrombin inhibition in the absence and presence of saturating heparin, indicating that the carbohydrate chains solely affected heparin binding and not heparin-activation or proteinasebinding functions. These results indicate that all carbohydrate chains of recombinant antithrombin adversely affect heparin-binding affinity to an extent that correlates with their relative proximity to the putative heparin-binding site in antithrombin. 1997

Antithrombin is the major plasma glycoprotein inhibitor of blood clotting serine proteinases [for reviews, see (1, 2)]. This inhibitor is a member of the serpin superfamily of proteins, most of which function to regulate the activity of proteinases in a number of key physiologic processes including blood clotting, inflammation, fibrinolysis, and host defense (3). The inhibition of proteinases by antithrombin and other serpins occurs through the formation of stable equimolar complexes which block the proteinase active site. This inhibition is slow in the case of antithrombin but is accelerated up to several thousandfold when the inhibitor binds the glycosaminoglycan effector, heparin (1). Heparin acceleration results in part from a conformational change induced in antithrombin by a sequence-specific pentasaccharide region in the glycosaminoglycan (4 ­ 9). Current approaches to elucidating the mechanism of heparin activation of antithrombin have used sitedirected mutagenesis of recombinant antithrombin to

map the functional residues responsible for heparin binding and activation of the inhibitor (10­12). One problem with this approach has been the heterogeneous glycosylation of the recombinant inhibitor expressed in mammalian cell lines, which results in multiple glycoforms having variable affinity for heparin. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to eliminate possible effects of glycosylation on heparin binding when mutations are used to map the heparin-binding site (13, 14). This problem cannot be overcome by expression in prokaryotic cells, which do not glycosylate, since functional antithrombin is not produced in such expression systems, possibly because of incorrect disulfide pairing or of the importance of glycosylation in the correct folding of the protein (15). Attempts to overcome this problem have involved mutating one of the four Asn-linked glycosylation sites of the inhibitor, which is known to affect heparin binding, the Asn 135 site (16­18). About 10% of plasma antithrombin thus lacks carbohydrate at the Asn 135 glycosylation site (designated b-antithrombin) and has a higher heparin affinity, presumably because the Asn 135 carbohydrate chain lies adjacent to the putative heparin-binding site and interferes with heparin binding (16). Mutation of Asn 135 to Gln has been shown to reduce but not to eliminate the several recombinant antithrombin glycoforms with different heparin affinities produced in BHK cells, suggesting that other glycosylation sites also affect heparin binding and that glycosylation heterogeneity at these other sites contributes to the multiple glycoforms (17). In the present study, we compare the effects of deleting each of the four Asn-linked carbohydrate chains of antithrombin by mutagenesis on the heparin-binding affinity of the inhibitor and on the generation of glycoforms differing in this affinity in the BHK cell expression system. Our results indicate that all four carbohydrate chains reduce heparin-binding affinity, although to varying extents, consistent with the relative proximity of these chains to the putative heparin-binding site in the tertiary structure of antithrombin (20, 21). Removal of the Asn 155 carbohydrate chain but not any of the other three chains is further shown to eliminate the lower heparin affinity form of the two major glycoforms produced by the BHK expression system. Such results demonstrate that heterogeneous glycosylation of the Asn 155 oligosaccharide chain is responsible for generating the two major glycoforms differing in heparin affinity. They further support the recent proposal that differential fucosylation of the Asn 155 oligosaccharide in these glycoforms is largely responsible for this heterogeneity (35).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Heparin and proteins. High-affinity heparins with a single antithrombin binding site and an average molecular weight of Ç8000

or Ç13,000 were isolated as described (22). Concentrations of the glycosaminoglycan were determined as antithrombin-binding sites by stoichiometric titrations of the inhibitor with polysaccharide, monitored from the intrinsic protein fluorescence enhancement which accompanies heparin binding (22). Site-directed mutagenesis of wild-type antithrombin cDNA in M13-based vectors, transfection of mutant cDNA in SV40-based vectors into stable BHK cell lines, and selection of cell lines expressing the mutation in high yield (3­9 mg/L) were done as described previously (23, 24). Wild-type and mutant recombinant antithrombins were purified from pooled serum-free medium cycles of expressing cells in roller bottle cultures by batchwise adsorption and elution from heparin-agarose followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialysis as described (25). Plasma antithrombin was purified as previously described (22). Concentrations of the plasma inhibitor were determined from the 280-nm absorbance using a molar absorption coefficient of 37,700 M01 cm01 (26). Because contaminating DNA released into the medium by cell death at later stages of growth can contribute to the absorbance of recombinant inhibitors, the protein concentration of recombinant antithrombins was determined by the Micro BCA assay (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer, using plasma antithrombin as standard. Typically, these concentrations were at most 20% lower than those determined by protein absorbance using the same absorption coefficient as plasma antithrombin, confirming that such contamination was minor. Resolution of antithrombin glycoforms with different heparin affinities. The number of glycoforms with different heparin affinities present in the purified recombinant antithrombins was analyzed by heparin-agarose chromatography of the variants with salt gradient elution (13, 14). Samples containing 3­5 mg purified protein were dialyzed overnight against starting buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4), applied to a preequilibrated heparin­Sepharose column (1 1 8 cm, Pharmacia Biotech) and then eluted with a 100-ml linear salt gradient up to a limit buffer containing 2.0 M NaCl. The flow rate was held constant at 0.3 ml/min with a pump, and protein elution from the column was continuously monitored by a Pharmacia Biotech UV absorbance detector at 280 nm. Pools of two major heparin affinity forms eluting at Ç0.5 M NaCl and Ç0.9­1.1 M NaCl (Fig. 1) were made as decribed in the legend to Fig. 1. The homogeneity, relative heparin affinities, and activities of the pooled major peaks of antithrombin variants obtained from heparinagarose chromatography were determined by rechromatography on the heparin-agarose affinity matrix. Antithrombin variant pools (5­ 100 mg) were chromatographed on a 5-ml Econo-Pac heparin cartridge column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) controlled by a Waters HPLC system and Millenium software. The chromatography program following sample injection was a 10-min wash with 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.4, followed by elution with a 25-min linear salt gradient from 0.1 to either 1.5 or 3 M NaCl in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was subsequently washed with 3 column volumes of buffer containing 3 M NaCl prior to reequilibration with 6 column volumes of starting buffer. Elution of antithrombin was monitored by protein fluorescence with excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 340 nm, respectively, using a Shimadzu fluorescence detector. NaCl concentrations corresponding to elution peaks were calculated based on a 6-min lag between the column and the detector. In some cases, 1-ml fractions were collected for activity and protein analysis. Measurement of functional inhibitor concentrations. Functional inhibitor concentrations in pooled low heparin affinity and high heparin affinity fractions were determined by stoichiometric titrations of thrombin with the inhibitors (22). Briefly, 50-ml volumes containing 50 nM thrombin and increasing levels of antithrombin up to a slight molar excess over proteinase were incubated overnight at 25 C (Ç16 h) in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% PEG 8000. Residual enzyme activ-

Assays for total antithrombin concentration were done by measuring the protein fluorescence of the fraction (lex 280 nm, lem 340 nm) and calculating the concentration from a calibration curve which related the fluorescence of plasma antithrombin to its concentration. Kinetics of antithrombin inhibition of thrombin. Second-order rate constants for the inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin variants in the absence and presence of heparin (Mr 8000) were determined under pseudo-first-order conditions as previously described (13). Briefly, reactions contained 50 nM antithrombin, 0­5 nM heparin, 0.5 nM thrombin, and 200 mM p-aminobenzamidine in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4, buffer. p-Aminobenzamidine was included to slow the rate of heparin-catalyzed reactions (27). Uncatalyzed reactions were performed both in the absence and in the presence of 100 mg/ml polybrene. Identical reaction samples of 50 ml were incubated at 25 C for various times and then quenched with 0.95 ml 50 mM tosyl-Gly-ProArg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin containing 100 mg/ml polybrene. The residual enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis fluorimetrically as indicated above. Observed pseudo-first-order rate constants for enzyme inactivation (kobs) were obtained by the fitting of enzyme inactivation data to a single exponential decay function (22). Second-order rate constants for the uncatalyzed antithrombin­thrombin reaction were obtained by dividing kobs by the inhibitor concentration and, for reactions conducted in the presence of p-aminobenzamidine, correcting for the competitive effect of p-aminobenzamidine (27). Second-order rate constants for heparin-catalyzed antithrombin­thrombin reactions were determined from the slope of the linear dependence of kobs on heparin concentration given by the equation (13) [AT]0 1 [H]0 / kuncat 1 [AT]0 , KAT,H / [AT]0

Elution profiles are shown for anti), N135Q ( -- - - -), N155Q (- - -), and thrombin variants N96Q ( N192Q ( -- -). Profiles were normalized to equivalent peak 2 absorbances arbitrarily given a value of 1. The thin dashed straight line shows the calculated NaCl concentrations of the fractions and the arrow indicates the single elution peak of plasma antithrombin chromatographed under identical conditions. Pools of the two major heparin-affinity forms were made as follows: N96Q , peak 1, fractions 20 ­ 35, peak 2, fractions 45 ­ 65; N155Q, peak 1, fractions 20 ­ 38, peak 2, fractions 50 ­ 70; and N192Q, peak 1, fractions 20 ­ 40, peak 2, fractions 50 ­ 65. For N135Q, fractions 36 ­ 103 were pooled, dialyzed, and rechromatographed on the column to reduce the amount of a low-affinity form corresponding to inactive antithrombin. The two major antithrombin fractions pooled from the second chromatography of N135Q were peak 1, fractions 36 ­ 45, peak 2, fractions 55 ­ 70.

ity was then measured by addition of 0.95 ml 100 mM D-Phe-Pip-Argp-nitroanilide (Chromogenix) and monitoring of the initial linear rate of substrate hydrolysis at 405 nm. The functional inhibitor concentration was obtained by least-squares analysis of the linear dependence of residual enzyme reaction rates on inhibitor concentration and equating the abscissa intercept corresponding to complete enzyme inhibition with the enzyme concentration. A similar stoichiometric assay was used to analyze the amount of functional inhibitor in fractions obtained by rechromatography of variant antithrombin pools. In this case reactions contained 1 nM thrombin and 1 mM high-affinity heparin (Mr 13,000) in the above buffer plus between 2 and 20 ml of the antithrombin fraction in a total volume of 100 ml. After incubation at 25 C for 1 h, residual enzyme activity was measured by addition of 0.9 ml 50 mM tosyl-GlyPro-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) plus 100 mg/ml polybrene (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI) and monitoring of the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis from the increase in fluorescence using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 440 nm, respectively. Indistinguishable results were obtained when reactions were allowed to proceed overnight, confirming that a stoichiometric endpoint was being measured. The concentration of enzyme inactivated was equated with the concentration of functional inhibitor in the assay. The different amounts of salt added to the activity assay did not significantly affect completion of the reaction (despite a reduced heparin rate acceleration at higher salt concentrations), but did affect the amount of inhibitor reacting as a substrate (22). This resulted in maximally a 30% underestimation of the functional inhibitor concentration. This uncertainty did not affect functional assays done in the absence of heparin since

where [H]0 and [AT]0 represent the total heparin and antithrombin concentrations, respectively, kH and kuncat are apparent second-order rate constants for heparin-catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions measured in the presence of p-aminobenzamidine, and KAT,H is the dissociation constant for heparin binding to antithrombin. The slope was obtained by linear regression analysis, divided by the factor [AT]0/ (KAT,H / [AT]0), representing the extent of saturation of the added heparin by antithrombin, to yield kH , and then corrected for the competitive effect of p-aminobenzamidine as for the uncatalyzed reaction. Equilibrium binding of heparin to antithrombin. Dissociation constants for high-affinity heparin binding to antithrombin were measured by inhibitor titrations with heparin (Mr 8000), monitored by intrinsic protein fluorescence changes (4, 28). Titrations were performed by making successive additions of heparin to an acrylic cuvette containing antithrombin in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4, at 25 C. The fluorescence changes were monitored in an SLM 8000 fluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 340 nm, respectively. Plasma or variant antithrombins (peak 2 pools) were titrated at concentrations around the dissociation constant (20 nM) to best determine KD and at concentrations exceeding the dissociation constant (100­660 nM) to assess binding stoichiometry. At least two titrations of each variant were done at each inhibitor concentration (four to six total titrations per variant). These titrations were individually computer fit by nonlinear regression analysis to the equation,

RESULTS

Isolation of Multiple Forms of Recombinant Antithrombin Glycosylation Variants Heterogeneous glycosylation of recombinant human antithrombin expressed in BHK or CHO mammalian cell lines was previously shown to be responsible for the isolation of distinct forms of the inhibitor which differed in their affinities for the glycosaminoglycan effector, heparin (13, 14). To investigate the source of this glycosylation heterogeneity, we determined whether eliminating any one of the four carbohydrate chains of antithrombin reduced the number of glycoforms with different heparin affinities. Four antithrombin variants with single amino acid substitutions of Gln for each of the four Asn residue sites of glycosylation, Asn 96, Asn 135, Asn 155, and Asn 192, were thus made by site-directed mutagenesis to block glycosylation at each of these sites. The effect of removing one of the carbohydrate chains on the number of heparin affinity glycoforms of recombinant antithrombin was examined by salt-gradient elution of each recombinant inhibitor variant from heparin-agarose, following their purification by batchwise adsorption and elution from the heparin-affinity matrix (25) (Fig. 1). Each variant showed two major peaks of protein absorbance centered at about 0.5 and 0.9­1.1 M NaCl and also, in most cases, a third minor peak eluting at Ç1.5 M NaCl, similar to the elution pattern previously observed when the wild-type recombinant inhibitor was chromatographed under the same conditions (14). However, further experiments indicated the presence of a distinct nonfunctional inhibitor form in the peak 1 fractions which had to be accounted for before the number of functional inhibitor forms in these variants could be ascertained. The existence of a nonfunctional form of the inhibitor was first indicated when all Gln 135 variant fractions beyond 35 in Fig. 1 were rechromatographed to better resolve the high heparin affinity fraction from the low heparin affinity fraction. This rechromatography thus resolved two major heparin affinity peaks eluting at

Ç0.7 and Ç1.1 M NaCl and a third minor low heparin affinity peak eluting at Ç0.5 M NaCl (not shown). Analysis of the thrombin inhibitory activity of pools of these peaks revealed that only the two peaks eluting at higher salt represented functional inhibitor (60­70%), whereas the peak eluting at the lowest salt concentration appeared to be nonfunctional (14% active). Pools of the two functional inhibitor peaks were made for subsequent analyses of this variant (see legend to Fig. 1). The presence of a distinct nonfunctional inhibitor form also in the peak 1 fractions of Gln 96, Gln 155, and Gln 192 variants was suggested from their low functional activities (10­40% active). By contrast, the peak 2 fractions of all variants consisted of mostly functional inhibitor (see next section). To determine whether the peak 1 fractions of all variants contained a functional low heparin affinity glycoform distinct from the high heparin affinity glycoform eluting in the peak 2 fractions, the peak 1 and peak 2 fractions were rechromatographed on an analytical scale and assays for total and functional inhibitor protein were performed (Fig. 2). This rechromatography demonstrated the presence of a nonfunctional inhibitor peak eluting prior to one or more functional inhibitor peaks in peak 1 fractions of Gln 96, Gln 135, and Gln 192 variants. Moreover, a predominant functional inhibitor form in peak 1 fractions was eluted in all cases at lower salt concentrations than that required to elute the major functional inhibitor form in peak 2 fractions rechromatographed identically.3 Notably, when the Gln 155 variant peak 1 fraction was rechromatographed, only a nonfunctional low heparin affinity fraction was found with all of the activity present due to a small amount of high heparin affinity peak 2 fraction which contaminated the peak 1 fraction. The existence of two major functional forms differing in heparin affinity in Gln 96, Gln 135, and Gln 192 variants was confirmed by rechromatography of mixtures of the functional low and high heparin affinity fractions and assaying the fractions for activity (not shown). Two functional forms were thus clearly resolved for each of these three variants. Together, these results suggest that deletion of the Asn 155 oligosaccharide eliminates a functional low heparin affinity form of the recombinant inhibitor. The presence of nonfunctional antithrombin in the recombinant inhibitor variants lacking one of the carbohydrate chains may reflect the greater propensity of deglycosylated serpins to spontaneously transform to more stable, but inactive, conformations with reduced heparin

The somewhat reduced functional compared to total inhibitor concentration in some peak 2 fractions results from as much as a 30% underestimation of the functional inhibitor in the heparin-based functional assay due to the reaction of some of the inhibitor as a substrate (see Experimental Procedures).

Rechromatography of peak 1 and peak 2 fractions of recombinant antithrombin variants. 5- to 100-mg samples of pooled peak 1 and peak 2 fractions of recombinant antithrombin variants from heparin-agarose chromatography (see Fig. 1 legend) were rechromatographed on heparin-agarose and fractions assayed for protein and activity as described under Experimental Procedures.

affinity, through intra- or intermolecular insertion of their reactive center loops into b-sheet A (31­34). Examination of the two major peak fractions of each variant antithrombin obtained from the first heparinagarose chromatography by SDS gel electrophoresis demonstrated a diffuse band for each fraction with a mobility greater than that of recombinant wild-type antithrombin (not shown), consistent with each form representing an antithrombin variant missing one carbohydrate chain. The diffuseness of the bands of all recombinant forms of antithrombin relative to plasma antithrombin reflects their heterogeneous glycosylation, since enzymatic deglycosylation of the wild-type recombinant inhibitor eliminates this diffuseness (13, 14). Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis of the two major forms of the variants further demonstrated that all forms were mostly monomeric antithrombin, although higher molecular weight species were evident in some cases in the low heparin affinity fractions, especially in the Gln 192 variant (not shown). Aggregation may

thus account for some of the inactive inhibitor in the low heparin affinity fractions (31, 32). Because the peak 1 pools (except for the Gln 155 variant) consisted of a mixture of nonfunctional and functional low heparin affinity forms of the inhibitor which could not be well resolved, we focused our attention on the characterization of the high heparin affinity peak 2 fractions whose glycosylation and heparin affinity in the case of the wild-type inhibitor most closely match that of plasma antithrombin (13, 14). Rechromatography of samples of pooled peak 2 fractions on heparin-agarose showed primarily a single inhibitor peak for all glycosylation variants with only minor amounts of the peak 1 fraction (Figs. 2 and 3). Moreover, the peak elution position of the Gln 96, Gln 155, and Gln 192 variants corresponded to a salt concentration similar to or slightly higher than that of plasma antithrombin chromatographed under the same conditions, whereas the peak of the Gln 135 variant eluted at a much higher salt concentration. The latter obser-

vation is in agreement with previous studies of natural and recombinant antithrombins lacking the Asn 135 carbohydrate chain (16­18). Kinetics of Thrombin Inhibition by Antithrombin Variants The higher heparin affinity peak 2 forms of each variant were further examined for their ability to inhibit thrombin and bind heparin. SDS gel electrophoresis demonstrated the ability of all peak 2 variants to form stable complexes with thrombin (not shown). Stoichiometric titrations of thrombin with these variants confirmed that the inhibitors were mostly active (63­83%). The small loss in functional activity appeared to reflect inhibitor instability, since further decreases in activity were evident upon storage. Table I shows the measured second-order rate constants for the reactions of the recombinant antithrombin variants with thrombin in the presence or absence of heparin, which were calculated based on the functional inhibitor concentration. The rate constants for thrombin inactivation by the variant inhibitors were indistinguishable from those of plasma antithrombin in the absence or presence of the polysaccharide activator, indicating that removal of any one of the carbohydrate chains did not affect proteinase inhibitory activity.

and Gln 192 variant antithrombins were similarly found to display normal inhibitor activity with thrombin in the absence of heparin when this activity was calculated based on the functional inhibitor concentration (kon Å 8­12 1 103 M01 s01).4 The peak 1 and peak 2 major fractions of the recombinant antithrombin variants thus differ only with regard to their heparinbinding activity and not their proteinase-binding activity, as was previously found with the wild-type inhibitor (13).

Thus, the weighted average KD values measured from five titrations of the Gln 135 peak 2 pool and four titrations of the Gln 155 peak 2 pool of these alternative preparations at inhibitor concentrations ranging from 50 to 200 nM were 2.8 { 0.7 and 9.3 { 1.0 nM, respectively, in excellent agreement with the data in Table II. Such results suggested that the presence of small amounts of low heparin affinity form in the high heparin affinity fraction of the recombinant antithrombins did not significantly affect measured heparin-binding affinities of this fraction.5
DISCUSSION

FIG. 4. Heparin-binding titrations of high heparin affinity glycoforms of recombinant antithrombin variants. Representative titrations of 100 nM antithrombin (A) or 20 nM antithrombin (B) with high-affinity heparin were monitored from tryptophan fluorescence changes accompanying the inhibitor­polysaccharide interaction as described under Experimental Procedures. Solid lines are nonlinear regression fits of data to the equilibrium binding equation of the text. Titrations shown are for plasma antithrombin (l), N96Q ( ), N135Q ( ), N155Q ( ), and N192Q (X).

The present study has shown that deletion of the Asn 155 carbohydrate chain of recombinant antithrombin expressed in BHK cells is sufficient to eliminate the lower heparin affinity form of two major glycoforms differing in heparin affinity which were previously shown to be produced in this expression system (13, 14). By contrast, deletion of the Asn 96-, Asn 135-, or Asn 192-linked oligosaccharides fails to affect the generation of these glycoforms. A similar finding has been made in the case of a BHK cell-derived variant antithrombin lacking just the Asn 135-linked oligosaccharide (17). Heterogeneous glycosylation of recombinant wild-type antithrombin in the BHK cell expression system was previously shown to be responsible for the generation of the two major glycoforms, the two forms differing in the extent of their glycosylation (13, 14). The low heparin affinity form thus possesses more car5 Nonfunctional low heparin affinity forms of recombinant antithrombins are expected to have greatly reduced affinity for heparin and thereby to not influence the binding of heparin to the functional high heparin affinity forms (31, 33).

bohydrate, characteristic of a greater degree of processing of the four glycosylation sites than the high heparin affinity form. Different extents of sialylation of the carbohydrate chains does not appear to be responsible for the different heparin affinities of the two glycoforms since enzymatic desialylation of these glycoforms does not normalize their heparin affinities (13). The elimination of the lower heparin affinity glycoform by deleting the Asn 155 carbohydrate chain, but not any of the other oligosaccharide chains of the recombinant inhibitor, indicates that heterogeneous glycosylation at Asn 155 is responsible for generating the two glycoforms. This conclusion is supported by a recent analysis of the carbohydrate chain compositions of the two major glycoforms of an Asn 135 r Gln variant expressed in BHK cells which revealed a clear correlation between the heparin affinity of the glycoforms and their extent of fucosylation of the Asn 155 oligosaccharide (35). Thus, the low heparin affinity glycoform was fully fucosylated, whereas the high heparin affinity form completely lacked fucose. By contrast, the Asn 96 and Asn 192 oligosaccharides of the Asn 135 r Gln variant were both completely fucosylated (35). These findings together with the present results therefore strongly suggest that differential fucosylation of the Asn 155 carbohydrate chain is responsible for generating the 10-fold difference in heparin affinity of the two glycoforms (13, 14). This conclusion is consistent with the greater extent of glycosylation of the low heparin affinity form since fucosylation represents a later stage in processing of the carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins and thus is associated with a greater extent of glycosylation (36). It is further supported by the ability to eliminate the two glycoforms with an N135Q/N155Q double mutant of antithrombin expressed in the BHK cell system (35). While these previous studies could not resolve whether the Asn 135 oligosaccharide also contributed to generating the two major glycoforms in wild-type antithrombin, the present study strongly suggests that the Asn 155 oligosaccharide alone is responsible for generating these two forms. Fucosylation of the Asn 155 oligosaccharide presumably reduces heparin affinity by anchoring the oligosaccharide to the protein in a manner which limits its conformational flexibility and orients it toward the heparin-binding site (35, 37). The lack of fucosylation of recombinant antithrombin expressed in a baculovirus system may explain why only a single glycoform of an N135A variant was observed (18). A third minor glycoform lacking carbohydrate at the Asn 135 glycosylation site is also produced in mammalian expression systems as well as normally in vivo (b-antithrombin) as a result of the lower efficiency of glycosylation of the Asn-X-Ser consensus sequence at the 135 site compared to the Asn-X-Thr sequence of the other three glycosylation sites (14, 19). This form

was apparent in the case of wild-type recombinant antithrombin as a third very high heparin affinity form eluting at Ç1.4 M NaCl. This minor glycoform lacking the Asn 135 carbohydrate chain also appears to be evident in the Asn 96, Asn 155, and Asn 192 variants, but not the Asn 135 variant as would be expected, as a third peak eluting at Ç1.4­1.5 M NaCl (Fig. 1). Our ability to account for this minor glycoform previously in wild-type and presently in the four variant antithrombins suggests that the four sites of glycosylation in the wild-type inhibitor and the three glycosylation sites in the variants are fully glycosylated in the two major glycoforms. Only the major high heparin affinity glycoforms of the four glycosylation variants were fully characterized in this study because these glycoforms were readily purified in a mostly functional state and, in the case of the wild-type recombinant inhibitor, this glycoform resembles plasma antithrombin in its heparin affinity and extent of glycosylation (13, 14). The characterization of the heparin-binding affinity of the variants demonstrated that deletion of any one of the four carbohydrate chains of recombinant antithrombin enhances the heparin binding affinity of the inhibitor to varying extents ranging from two- to sevenfold, with removal of the Asn 135 carbohydrate chain having the largest effect on this affinity. The altered heparin affinities of the variant antithrombins relative to the wild-type inhibitor were clearly established by measuring the affinities over a wide range of inhibitor concentrations where both the stoichiometry and the affinity of the interactions were well determined. Previous studies have reported similar effects of the Asn 135 carbohydrate chain on heparin affinity (16­18). Another earlier study of an N155Q recombinant antithrombin found that deletion of the Asn 155 carbohydrate chain enhanced the heparin-affinity of the inhibitor, but no attempt was made to determine the number of heparinaffinity glycoforms present (23). That Asn-linked oligosaccharides other than the Asn 135 oligosaccharide influence the heparin affinity of the inhibitor is supported by the observation that a recombinant N135A variant antithrombin expressed in a baculovirus system containing smaller N-linked oligosaccharides than plasma- or BHK cell-expressed antithrombins exhibits a higher heparin affinity than comparable forms of the latter antithrombins lacking the Asn 135 oligosaccharide (38). The different effects of each of the four carbohydrate chains on heparin binding can be rationalized by the relative proximity of these chains to the putative heparin-binding site in the X-ray structure of antithrombin (20, 21) (Fig. 5). Based on studies of natural and engineered antithrombin variants with defects in heparin-binding, the heparin-binding region is thought to lie along the D helix, with residues from the amino-

maximal enhancement of this rate constant by heparin is unaffected (14, 17, 18, 38). This observation has suggested that deletion of the Asn 135-oligosaccharide leads to a small extent of antithrombin activation in the absence of heparin by increasing slightly the stability of the activated conformation of the inhibitor which is induced by heparin. Whether other Asn-linked oligosaccharides similarly affect the activated conformation of antithrombin is presently not clear, but remains an intriguing possibility since the Asn 96, Asn 155, and Asn 192 regions of the polypeptide may be involved in the conformational changes thought to accompany inhibitor activation (41).
