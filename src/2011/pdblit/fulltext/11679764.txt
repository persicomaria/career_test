The structure of the YlxR protein of unknown function from Ê Streptococcus pneumonia was determined to 1.35 A. YlxR is expressed from the nusA/infB operon in bacteria and belongs to a small protein family (COG2740) that shares a conserved sequence motif GRGA(Y/W). The family shows no signi®cant amino-acid sequence similarity with other proteins. Three-wavelength diffraction Ê MAD data were collected to 1.7 A from orthorhombic crystals using synchrotron radiation and the structure was determined using a semiautomated approach. The YlxR structure resembles a two-layer / sandwich with the overall shape of a cylinder and shows no structural homology to proteins of known structure. Structural analysis revealed that the YlxR structure represents a new protein fold that belongs to the ± plait superfamily. The distribution of the electrostatic surface potential shows a large positively charged patch on one side of the protein, a feature often found in nucleic acid-binding proteins. Three sulfate ions bind to this positively charged surface. Analysis of potential binding sites uncovered several substantial clefts, with the largest spanning 3/4 of the protein. A similar distribution of binding sites and a large sharply bent cleft are observed in RNA-binding proteins that are unrelated in sequence and structure. It is proposed that YlxR is an RNA-binding protein.

1. Introduction
Structural genomics is ¯ourishing owing to tremendous progress in genome sequencing as well as recent advances in computer and software technology and third-generation synchrotron beamlines for macromolecular crystallography. One of the foremost goals of structural genomics is to map the entire protein-folding space. This can be accomplished by solving the structures of a large number (15 000±20 000) of carefully selected proteins that show no signi®cant sequence homology to each other and are therefore likely to include the majority of unique protein folds (Vitkup et al., 2001). It is anticipated that this effort will expand knowledge of protein structure and will facilitate solving the structures of other proteins. For many proteins, function has not yet been established. It is expected that structural genomics will help to assign functions to proteins when assignment is not possible with amino-acid sequence comparisons alone (Shazand et al., 1993; Christendat et al., 2000). This is especially important as thousands of newly identi®ed open reading frames (ORFs) representing putative protein genes became available from genome-sequencing programs. Structural

information may provide important functional clues. The selection of proteins for structure determination is key to the structural genomics approach (Linial & Yona, 2000). In this work we applied the following three criteria: (i) uniqueness of amino-acid sequence, to increase chances of identifying a new protein fold, (ii) unknown function, to aid function assignment to a new class of proteins, and (iii) origin from a pathogenic bacterium, to provide a basis for future investigation of the protein as a potential target for new drugs. These criteria were met by the YlxR homologue from S. pneumonia: a 97 amino-acid protein of unknown function whose gene is located 21 bp downstream of the nusA gene and 248 bp upstream of the infB gene. The YlxR name was given to the S. pneumonia ORF to re¯ect its similarity to the YlxR protein of Bacillus subtilis (Fig. 1) (Overbeek et al., 2000; http://selkov.mcs.anl.gov/ WIT2/CGI/prot.cgi?prot=RPN00578&user). YlxR belongs to a small 13-member protein family (COG2740; Tatusov et al., 2001; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/COG/ palox?COG2740) predicted to be nucleic acidbinding proteins and implicated in transcription termination. YlxR shows no signi®cant sequence similarity to any other protein,

infB) is a translation-initiation factor associated with ribosomes and plays a crucial role in translation initiation (Grill et al., 2000). NusA, IF2 and RbfA are cold-shock proteins (Bae et al., 2000). No function has been assigned to the remaining four proteins encoded by the operon, including YlxR (Overbeek et al., 2000).

2. Material and methods

including proteins of known structure, as determined by analysis of the ProtoMap Database (Portugaly & Linial, 2000; http:// www.protomap.cs.huji.ac.il/). YlxR is located in the putative nusA/infB operon of S. pneumonia which consists of seven genes. Three of these genes, rbfA, nusA and infB, are present in other bacteria. RbfA is a conserved protein that binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and is believed to be involved in ribosomal maturation (it is essential for 16SrRNA processing) and/or translation initiation (Dammel & Noller, 1995). NusA, which is unique to prokaryota, is essential for bacterial viability and is involved in the modulation of RNA polymerase processivity leading to transcription antitermination (Vogel & Jensen, 1997; Mah et al., 1999). Homologues of NusA are also found in archaebacteria. IF2 (product of

The ylxR gene was ampli®ed by PCR with the NdeI and BamHI sites engineered at the translation start codon and immediately downstream of the translation stop codon, respectively, and cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET15b vector (Novagen) in frame with the His tag and the thrombin cleavage site. Expression of the His-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21[DE3] carrying the pMAGIC vector was induced with isopropyl--dthiogalactoside. Cells were harvested after 4 h culture at 310 K, suspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10 mM mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol and lysed by sonication. The fusion protein was puri®ed by af®nity chromatography using Ni-NTA Super¯ow resin (Qiagen). The His tag was removed by digestion with thrombin and the resulting protein was puri®ed following the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). In this design, three amino-acid residues were added at the N-terminus of YlxR. The protein was further puri®ed on an SP

Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia) using 0.5 and 1.0 M NaCl two-step elution and concentrated with simultaneous buffer exchange using Centriplus-3 (3 kDa cut-off; Amicon). A 2 mM protein stock solution in 10 mM Tris±HCl pH 7.4, 20 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT was used for crystallization. Selenomethionine (SeMet) labeled YlxR protein was prepared by a standard procedure using methionine-biosynthesis inhibition (Walsh et al., 1999). Equal volumes of YlxR protein stock solution and buffers were mixed in hanging drops and equilibrated against 1 ml of solutions from Hampton Research sparse-matrix crystallization screening kits. YlxR was crystallized from 0.2 M potassium sodium tartrate, 100 mM sodium acetate pH 5.6 and 2 M ammonium sulfate at 283 K. Crystals (0.2 Â 0.2 Â 0.1 mm) were brie¯y rinsed in cryoprotectant solution consisting of 25% glycerol in the crystallization solution and ¯ash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the 19BM beamline of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Crystals of native YlxR protein and its SeMet derivative Ê diffracted to 1.35 and 1.7 A, respectively. Ê MAD data were collected to 1.7 A resolution from a single crystal containing SeMetlabeled protein at three different X-ray wavelengths near the Se edge. The inversebeam strategy was used. The absorption edge was determined by a ¯uorescent scan of the crystal as described in Walsh et al. (1999). The data were processed using the HKL2000 suite (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Crystal characteristics and datacollection statistics are presented in Table 1. The structure of YlxR was determined using the MAD approach. A single SeMet site was selected from the asymmetric unit and MAD phases were calculated using the CNS suite (Brunger et al., 1998) (Table 2). These MAD phases were improved using density modi®cation as implemented in CNS. Electron-density maps were high quality and allowed autotracing of the amino-acid chain using the wARP program (Perrakis et al., 1999). The procedure provided an initial model containing 91 out of 100 amino-acid residues. The model was Ê re®ned using 1.35 A data with the REFMAC program from the CCP4 suite (Murshudov et al., 1999). Manual adjustment and model building using the program O (Jones et al., 1991) allowed the addition of three more amino-acid residues. Application of anisotropic re®nement of B factors as implemented by REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1999) improved the R factor and Rfree to 15.7

Six amino-acid residues present at the N-terminus of the protein were not visible in the electron density: the three residues remaining from the af®nity-tag fusion and the ®rst three residues of YlxR. Residues 4 and 5 of YlxR were modeled using a partial occupancy of 62% because of the disorder of the protein N-terminus. 13 amino-acid side chains (residues 6, 12, 21, 30, 31, 39, 41, 45, 51, 64, 74, 75 and 88) showed double occupancy. Partial occupancies of alternate conformers were calculated with the program SHELXL (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997).

The protein structure resembles a two-layer / sandwich with an overall cylindrical shape (Fig. 2). N-terminal residues 1±19 do not form any regular secondary structure. This segment is followed by a very short 310-helix (residues 20±22). The central part of the protein consists of three antiparallel -strands (1, 2 and 3). The Cterminal part of the protein forms two relatively long -helices (1 and 2). 1 is bent at Lys63 by approximately 60 , giving rise to two sub-helices (1a and 1b). Helix 1b interacts with 3; helix 1a is parallel to and interacts with 2. Helix 2 also interacts with 2 and closes the cylindrical structure (Fig. 2b). A well de®ned hydrophobic core is formed by the residues of helices 1a and 1b, the loop between 1 and 2, the N-terminal part of 2, all three -strands and Val12 and Val13. The Protein Data Bank was searched (DALI server; Holm & Sander, 1993) to identify proteins with structural similarity to YlxR.

tial interaction of proteins such as YlxR with DNA/RNA phosphate groups. We have searched for potential binding sites on the surface of YlxR using the program SURFNET (Laskowski, 1995). This analysis revealed several clefts (gap regions) on the protein surface (Fig. 4). The largest cleft (labeled in red in Fig. 4), with a volume Ê of 2885 A3, runs around 3/4 of protein surface, encompasses two sulfate ions and is near the third sulfate ion. The cleft is sharply bent ($100 ) near conserved Arg9, Arg25 and Tyr48 and could accommodate an L-shaped RNA (tRNA-like) molecule. Sulfate ions 1 and 2 are located at the position where the cleft is bent. A strikingly similar distribution of binding sites and a large sharply bent cleft is observed in RNAbinding protein U1A of Hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (PDB code 1cx0; Ferre-D'Amare et al., 1998). Furthermore, because the majority of genes that ¯ank ylxR gene in the 13 known nusA/infB operons code for proteins that bind RNA and/or participate in processes involving RNA (Vogel & Jensen, 1997; Mah et al., 1999; Dammel & Noller, 1995; Bylund et al., 1998; Grill et al., 2000), we propose that YlxR, consistent with the prediction made for COG2740 (Tatusov et al., 2001; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/COG/ palox?COG2740), is very likely to be an RNA-binding protein.
