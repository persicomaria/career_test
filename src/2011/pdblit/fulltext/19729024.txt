Crystal structures of Bacillus stearothermophilus TRS40 neopullulanase and its complexes with panose, maltotetraose and isopanose were determined ° at resolutions of 1.9, 2.4, 2.8 and 3.2 A, respectively. Since the latter two carbohydrates are substrates of this enzyme, a deactivated mutant at the catalytic residue Glu357 ! Gln was used for complex crystallization. The structures were refined at accuracies with r.m.s. deviations of bond ° ° lengths and bond angles ranging from 0.005 A to 0.008 A and 1.38 to 1.48, respectively. The active enzyme forms a dimer in the crystalline state and in solution. The monomer enzyme is composed of four domains, N, A, B and C, and has a (b/a)8-barrel in domain A. The active site lies between domain A and domain N from the other monomer. The results show that dimer formation makes the active-site cleft narrower than those of ordinary a-amylases, which may contribute to the unique substrate specificity of this enzyme toward both a-1,4 and a-1,6-glucosidic linkages. This specificity may be influenced by the subsite structure. Only subsites 2 1 and 2 2 are commonly occupied by the product and substrates, suggesting that equivocal recognition occurs at the other subsites, which contributes to the wide substrate specificity of this enzyme.

Introduction
Neopullulanase (EC 3.2.1.135) from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been shown to be a member of a-amylase family 13.1 The enzymes of this family possess common feature in the threedimensional and primary structures. They have strictly conserved three catalytic residues, but differ in other parts that constitute the active site depending on their substrate specificity.2 Neopullulanase is one of the family enzymes with a unique substrate specificity, hydrolyzes pullulan to produce panose, maltose and glucose in a final molar ratio of 3:1:1.3,4 This enzyme hydrolyzes a1,4 and a-1,6-glucosidic linkages, and catalyzes transglycosylation reactions to form both a-1,4 and a-1,6-glucosidic bonds.5 Recently, this enzyme was shown to exhibit high specificity toward cyclodextrins (CDs) and the order of specificity is

CD . amylose . pullulan.6 There have been extensive studies on enzymes that exhibit similar substrate speci-ficities,7,8 which suggested that these homologous enzymes might form a family.9 In this family, which typically consists of four subclasses of enzymes, cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase), maltogenic amylase (MAase), Thermoactinomyces vulgaris a-amylase II (TVAII) and neopullulanase have been studied independently. The three-dimensional structures of one or more members of these enzyme subclasses have been determined.9 ­ 11 These studies have revealed common three-dimensional structural motifs: the presence of an N-domain, the presence of a (b/a)8-barrel, and dimeric or oligomeric structures with an active site formed between the N-containing and barrelcontaining domains, as well as sequence homology. Very recently, the identity of these enzyme subclasses has been proposed;9 however, they still show characteristic distinguishing biochemical and structural features. We undertook a threedimensional X-ray structure analysis of neopullulanase and its substrate-complexed structures, to better understand the detailed structural mechanism that gives rise to the fine specificity toward

Structure and Substrate Binding of Neopullulanase

Results
Overall structure Neopullulanase forms a dimer in the crystalline state and in solution. The monomer and dimer structures are shown in Figure 1. Domain N, residues 1­ 123, is specific to neopullulanase and other homologues, and is composed of 12 antiparallel b-strands, with a typical b-sheet composed of strands Nb4, Nb7 and Nb9, as shown topologically in Figure 2. Domain A, residues 124 ­246 and 300 ­ 506, contains a (b/a)8-barrel structure that is found commonly in enzymes of the a-amylase family. The fifth a-helix and the sixth b-strand in domain A are incomplete compared to ideal structures. Domain B, residues 247­ 299, is small and contains only one a-helix of one and a half turns, with non-regular secondary structures in the other part. Domain C, residues 507 ­588, consists of an antiparallel eight-stranded b-sheet. One calcium atom was found in each enzyme molecule of a dimer in the asymmetric unit (Figure 1(a)). The two enzyme molecules, denoted as Mol-1 and Mol-2, in the asymmetric unit of the crystal form a homodimer as shown in Figure 1(b). The r.m.s. deviations of the main chains between Mol-1 and Mol-2 in the native state and in complexes with panose, maltotetraose and isopanose ° are 0.84, 0.84, 0.60 and 0.54 A, respectively, which indicates that these monomer enzymes have an almost identical conformation. However, small but significant structural differences are found in domain N. In complexes with maltotetraose and isopanose, loops in domain N are flipped toward the active cleft so as to bind substrates, as described later. In these two crystals, the molecules are packed somewhat differently than they are in the native state, causing slight changes in the unit ° ° ° cell dimensions, from 72.8 A to 74.4 A and 73.8 A in the b-axis of the maltotetraose and isopanose complexes, respectively. The r.m.s. deviations from the native dimer for the main-chain atoms of complexed dimer molecules with panose, malto° ° tetraose and isopanose are 0.41 A, 0.84 A and ° 0.87 A, respectively. Calcium binding One calcium-binding site was found in each monomer, as shown in Figure 1(a). The location of this site is different from the conserved primary calcium-binding site in most enzymes in the a-amylase family. Instead, it is located in the ° periphery of the (b/a)8-barrel, at about 25 A from the catalytic center. The calcium ion is bound to Asn147 OD1, Asn149 O, Ser153 OG, Gly172 O, Asp174 OD2 and one water molecule, to give a distorted octahedral configuration (Figure 3). The distance between the calcium ion and the above atoms in the native form is 2.40, 2.58, 2.51, 2.45, ° 2.38 and 2.48 A, respectively. A calcium ion is found at this site in the structures of the panose,

substrate, as well as the differences between these homologous enzymes. This is the first report demonstrating the dual specificity of the enzyme toward a-1,4 and a-1,6-glucosidic linkages based on structural analyses of the complexes with the enzyme and substrates. The strong transglycosylation activity of neopullulanase is discussed on the basis of the structural analyses.

maltotetraose and isopanose complexes, and the coordination configuration is almost identical with that in the native state. However, the electron densities at this site in these complexed structures were not high, and it was difficult to determine the location of the calcium ion without knowing its location in the native form. This result suggests that binding to the calcium ion is not essential for either catalysis or structural stabilization.

Dimer structure The dimer is formed by Mol-1 and Mol-2 making contact with each other at the surfaces of domains A, B and N, as shown in Figure 1(b). In contrast to the active cleft of the monomer, which is wide and shallow, that in the dimer is narrower. The results of dynamic light-scattering and equilibrium ultracentrifugation showed that neopullulanase exists

as a dimer even in solution. A similar dimer structure has been reported for homologous enzymes.9 ­ 11 Thus, dimer formation may be thought to be essential for these homologous enzymes to exhibit unique substrate specificity common to these homologous enzymes. There are 36 intermolecular amino acid residueamino acid residue hydrogen bonds between the monomer molecules in the dimer, and there are 332 van der Waals contacts whose distances are ° less than 4 A. The list of intermolecular hydrogen bond atom pairs and distances are given as Supplementary Material. Since the dimer molecules are related by an approximate twofold axis, the combinations of atom pairs are mostly repeated twice. A total of 138 water molecules are located in the region of contact between Mol-1 and Mol-2. While most of the intermolecular contacts are formed by usual hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions, some arginine residues make contact with each other despite possible repulsive interaction. The side-chain atoms of residues Arg2, Arg339 and Arg367 in each of the dimer molecules make contact at distances of about ° 3.5 A. It is possible that the side-chains of residues Arg339 and Arg367 form intramolecular saltbridges with Asp369 and Asp12, respectively, to reduce the repulsive force. However, it has been reported that the guanidium groups of arginine residues can make p-stacking interactions, juxtaposed to each other, as observed in the recognition of antigen by antibody.12,13 Thus, in the dimerization of neopullulanase, p-stacking may partly provide attractive interaction. Structure in substrate binding Bound substrates were identified as electron densities in the region of the active site where the catalytic residues Asp328, Glu357 and Asp424 are located. While the active site in a monomer enzyme is shallow and wide, a narrow cleft is formed by dimer formation. The resulting cleft, formed by domain A and part of B of Mol-1 and domain N of Mol-2, is slightly curved and open at

both ends. Domain N contributes significantly to the definition of the cleft structure. The electron densities in the complexes with panose, maltotetraose and isopanose were clearly identified at the active cleft. One substrate molecule was found in each monomer. The structural models of these substrates superimposed on 2Fo 2 Fc omit maps around the active cleft are shown in Figure 4, indicating satisfactory agreement. Drawings of the resulting binding between the enzyme and these substrates are shown in Figure 5, for panose, maltotetraose and isopanose-complexed structures. In this Figure, hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and substrate atoms are indicated by ° dotted lines for those of distances less than 3.4 A. The subsite numbers are shown. In the panosecomplexed structure (Figure 5(a)), three glucose units of bound panose are designated Glc 2 3 to Glc 2 1 from the non-reducing toward the reducing end. In the same manner, those in the maltotetraose (Figure 5(b)) and isopanose (Figure 5(c)) complexes are indicated as Glc 2 2 to Glc þ 2 and Glc 2 2 to Glc þ 1, respectively. Only subsites 2 2 and 2 1 are commonly occupied in these substrate complexes. The list of hydrogen bonds between amino acid and substrates atoms in the active site are given for both of Mol-1 and Mol-2 in the Supplementary Material. The structures of the individual complexes are described below. Panose binding Panose is bound by its maltose moiety at subsites 2 1 and 2 2, as shown in Figure 5(a). The side-chain atoms of the catalytic residues Asp328, Glu357 and Asp424 form hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups of Glc 2 1 and there is close contact between Asp328 OD1 and C1 of Glc 2 1 ° (2.7 A). Close contact between C1 and a catalytic aspartic acid residue has been observed in other amylases.14,15 The side-chain atoms of residues His247, Arg326 and His423 form hydrogen bonds with O6, O2 and O2 plus O3 of Glc 2 1 with dis° tances of 2.7, 2.9, 3.3 and 3.3 A, respectively. Overall, ten hydrogen bonds are formed between Glc

2 1 and the enzyme. In addition to these hydrogen bonds, the side-chains of Phe289, Tyr207 and Val329 make hydrophobic contact with the same glucose unit. The extensive hydrogen bonds and these hydrophobic interactions indicate strong binding of the substrate at subsite 2 1. There are five hydrogen bonds in Glc 2 2 and one in Glc 2 3, and, in addition, these sugar residues have hydrophobic interactions with the side-chains of His205, Pro167 and Val292. Maltotetraose binding The glucose residues in bound maltotetraose occupy four subsites, 2 2 to þ 2 (Figure 5(b)), with a sharp bend at the glucosidic linkage between Glc 2 1 and Glc þ 1. At subsites 2 1 and 2 2, the interactions between the enzyme and substrate are similar to those in the panose-complexed form. The distance between C1 of Glc 2 1 and ° Asp328OD1 is close to 2.8 A. The interactions between Glc þ 1 and the side-chains of Phe289, Val329 of Mol-1 and Tyr45 of Mol-2 are mainly hydrophobic. The side-chain atoms of mutated catalytic residue Gln357 form a hydrogen bond with O3 (Glc þ 1), and have close contacts with O4 ° (Glc þ 1) with distances of 3.1 and 3.2 A, respectively. The glucose moiety on the reducing end (Glc þ 2) has stacking interactions with the sidechains of Trp359 and Tyr377. The atoms in Glc þ 2 form contacts with the loop atoms (residues

105­ 113) in domain N of Mol-2, which is brought into close proximity by the induced fit, to make contact with the side-chain atoms of Arg83 and Thr111. With this induced fit, the Ca atom of ° Thr111 is moved about 5 A relative to that in the native form.

Isopanose binding In this complex, careful model-fitting to the electron density revealed that the a-1,6-glucosidic linkage is located between subsites 2 1 and þ 1, reflecting a-1,6 bond cleavage. The maltose moiety of isopanose is bound at subsites 2 2 and 2 1, as in the other complexes. Since the glucose unit at the reducing end is bound to maltose via an a-1,6 linkage, the subsite of this glucose unit should be designated differently from those in other complexes. Thus, this site is denoted Glc þ 10 , as shown in Figure 5(c). The atoms in glucose residue Glc þ 10 have only hydrophobic contacts with the side-chains of Phe289, Val329 and Trp359 of Mol-1, and Tyr45 of Mol-2. However, in the active site of Mol-2, the contact with Trp359 is lost, suggesting that the intermolecular forces at this site are not very strong. This lack of rigorousness at subsite þ 1 (þ 10 ) results in the dual recognition of a-1,4 and a-1,6-glucosidic linkages. The contacts in the region of subsites 2 1 and 2 2 are similar to those in the maltotetraose-complexed form.

Discussion
Dual recognition of a-1,4 and a-1,6-glucosidic bonds B. stearothermophilus neopullulanase has been shown biochemically to hydrolyze both a-1,4 and a-1,6 linkages. The present analysis based on its complexes with three different kinds of the product and substrates showed that these reactions must take place at the same catalytic site. The conformations and relative arrangement of the catalytic residues Asp328, Glu(Gln)357, and Asp424 and other important residues with respect to the scissile bond of the bound substrates are almost identical in these complexes, as shown in Figure 6. These facts suggest that both a-1,4 and a-1,6-glucosidic linkages may be hydrolyzed by neopullulanase and other a-amylases in the same manner, as

has been shown in previous studies.16 ­ 18 This duality arises from characteristic features of the subsite structures of the enzyme, which will be discussed later.

Substrate binding and specificity The modes of subsite binding for the product and substrates to the present enzyme are illustrated by Figure 5, and superimposed substrates structures at the active site in Figure 6. In the panose, maltotetraose, and isopanose complexes, the cleavage point is located at the reducing end, at the central glucosidic bond, and at the a-1,6 bond, respectively, as shown schematically in Figure 7. These results suggest that the enzyme prefers to bind substrates with subsites 2 1 and 2 2 occupied by a-1,4-linked glucose residues. The specific activity of the enzyme toward substrates decreases in the order cyclomaltodextrin . amylose . pullulan. The novel specificities toward CD and pullulan may be due to this subsite affinity, since in these substrates only two a-1,4linked glucose residues can be bound onto subsites 2 1 and 2 2 in the active cleft of the enzyme. The features of subsite structure different from that in isoamylase16 when the presence of a leucine residue Leu376 in the region 2 of isoamylase blocks the binding of a-1,4 linked glucose at subsite þ 1, giving rise to the substrate specificity solely toward an a-1,6 linkage. A preference for the hydrolysis of CDs has been suggested in the structures of the homologous enzymes TVAII19 and MAase,8 in which phenylalanine residues, Phe286 and Phe289, respectively, help to bind CD at the active cleft. Furthermore, aromatic side-chains, tryptophan (Trp47) and tyrosine (Tyr45), in the other subunit enzyme in the MAase dimer make hydrophobic interactions with

In isopanose binding, the subsite at the reducing end is denoted þ10 , since this has a different binding mode (a-1,6 linked) from the others (a-1,4 linked).

CD, which enhances the activity toward CDs significantly. Dimer formation in the present and homologous enzymes causes narrowing of the active-site cleft compared to a-amylases. This may make it more difficult for a linear amylose chain, whose natural conformation is a loose helix, to bind than for CDs. While there has been no previous report on the direct measurement of the specific activities of neopullulanase and a-amylase toward amylose, we evaluated their relative activities toward amylose on the basis of published data using the same enzyme assay procedure for neopullulanase and Bacillus licheniformis (BLA) and Bacillus subtilis (BSA) a-amylases. We obtained a value of 37 units/mg for neopullulanase20 toward potato amylose, in contrast to 1600 and 360 units/mg for BLA21 and BSA,22 respectively. In addition to dimer formation, the above-described affinity specific to subsites 2 1 and 2 2, may underlie the selective hydrolysis of the present enzyme toward cyclomaltodextrins, amylose and pullulan, in this order. Induced-fit movement A significant induced fit was observed at the active site of the present enzyme upon binding to maltotetraose. In the native enzyme structure, the regions of residues that form the cleft, Asn49 and Thr111 from the N-domain of the other molecule of the dimer, showed different conformations between Mol-1 and Mol-2, where the maximum ° deviations of the main-chain atoms were 7.5 A ° , respectively. This shows that these and 5.4 A regions are inherently flexible, and form loops at the reducing end of the bound maltotetraose. Upon binding maltotetraose, the region near residue Thr111 has moved toward the bound maltotetraose so as to make a hydrogen bond between Thr111OG1 and O2 (Glc þ 2), at a distance of ° 3.2 A. An induced fit occurred in the side-chain of Arg83, and this formed a hydrogen bond between Arg83 NH2 and O2 (Glc þ 2), at a distance of ° 3.3 A. Although the loop region around Asn49

was not involved in substrate binding, it showed significant movement upon binding to maltotetraose. This is thought to be caused by the induced-fit movement of the Thr111-centered loop such that the Trp52 side-chain in the loop makes ° new contact (3.5 A) with the side-chain methyl group of Thr111, probably via C ­H· · ·pinteraction at the pyrrolidinyl ring of the tryptophan sidechain. This shows that an induced-fit further induced a movement of the loop composed of residues around Asn49. Possible acceptor binding for transglycosylation Neopullulanase strongly catalyzes a transglycosylation reaction to form both a-1,4 and a-1,6 linkages.5 In the complexes in the present analysis, we observed a significant electron density in close proximity to the bound maltotetraose and isopanose molecules, as shown in Figure 8. The electron density approximately corresponds to that of maltose. Although mutant enzymes were used in the crystals of these complexes, it is possible that maltose is produced by hydrolysis of maltotetraose or isopanose, as seen with other amylase enzymes.14,23 This maltose may be a potential acceptor in the transglycosylation reaction of neopullulanase. The position and shape of the electron density shown in Figure 8 enables suitable contacts between the side-chains of Tyr45, Trp47, and Phe289, with distances suggesting van der Waals contact. A similar feature has been observed in the analysis of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase,24,25 which shows strong transglycosylation activity. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that this electron density can be assigned to maltose, which may work as a reactant for transglycosylation.

Isopanose was prepared from the hydrolysate of pullulan by isopullulanase according to the method described by Sakano et al.26 Preparation and purification Escherichia coli TG-1 was used as a host to prepare neopullulanase from B. stearothermophilus TRS40, as described.27 E. coli TG-1 carrying a recombinant plasmid, pUNP129 (Apr nplT þ, structural gene of the neopullulanase from B. stearothermophilus TRS40), was incubated overnight in 120 ml of L broth containing 100 mg/ml of ampicillin at 30 8C. Next, 1 l of L broth containing 100 mg/ml of ampicillin in a 2 l Sakaguchi flask was inoculated with 10 ml of the overnight preculture and shaken at 30 8C to the mid-log phase (absorbance at 660 nm ¼ 0.6). Isopropyl-b, D -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; final concentration 1 mM) was added as an inducer of the lac promoter, and cultivation was continued at 30 8C for 15 hours from the time of inoculation. Overall, 10 l of this cell culture was used for enzyme purification. The cell-culture sample was harvested by centrifugation (8000 g for five minutes) and washed with buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5). The cell pellet was then suspended in buffer A containing 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The cells were disrupted by sonication (19.5 kHz, 4 8C for 20 minutes), and the cell extract was treated at 60 8C for ten minutes to denature the proteins derived from E. coli. The remnant was removed by centrifugation (10,000 g for 20 minutes). Ammonium sulfate (final 70% saturation) was added to the supernatant, and the solution was kept

overnight at 4 8C. After centrifugation (10,000 g for 20 minutes), the precipitate was dissolved in about 100 ml of buffer A containing 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and dialyzed against buffer A containing 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme solution was applied to a column (26 mm £ 200 mm) of Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Active enzyme was eluted with a 0 ­ 0.4 M NaCl gradient. Ammonium sulfate was added to the enzyme fraction to a final concentration of 0.6 M, and the mixture was applied to a column (26 mm £ 100 mm) of Phenyl-Toyopearl 650 M (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.6 M ammonium sulfate. The active fraction was eluted with 0.6 M ­ 0 M ammonium sulfate gradient and dialyzed against buffer A containing 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The neopullulanase was finally purified to homogeneity using a Source 15Q (Pharmacia) column (10 mm £ 100 mm) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme was eluted with a 0.15 M ­ 0.5 M NaCl gradient. Mutated neopullulanase (Glu357 ! Gln; E357Q) gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli,20 and purification was performed in the same way as for the native enzyme. Dynamic light-scattering and equilibrium ultracentrifugation Prior to crystallization, the protein solution was checked for its suitability for crystallization. Dynamic light-scattering was performed and analyzed using a Dyna-Pro 810TC instrument (Protein Solution Inc.), with a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in 5 mM phosphate

Crystallization Crystallization of the uncomplexed native form was performed by the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method. The reservoir solution was 100 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), containing 180 mg/ml of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 and 300 mM sodium chloride. The enzyme was dissolved in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer solution at pH 6.5 containing 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The ratio of protein to reservoir solution in the crystallization drop was 1:1 (vol). Crystallization was performed at 20 8C, and crystals appeared within two weeks. To prepare substrate-complexed crystals, after several trials, panosecomplex and maltotetraose-complex crystals were obtained by co-crystallization with the native form and mutant E357Q, respectively. The reservoir solution in this co-crystallization was the same as that of the native form, with concentrations of panose and maltotetraose in the drop of 30 mM and 25 mM, respectively. An isopanose-complexed crystal was obtained by soaking in the same solution with the cryoprotectant described below containing 20 mM isopanose for ten minutes, since this did not form crystals by co-crystallization. For X-ray diffraction experiments, these crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant solution buffered with 50 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5) containing 300 mg/ml of PEG8000 and 200 mM sodium chloride.

Data collection and processing The intensity data of the native and substrate-complexed crystals were collected on an ADSC CCD area detector at the BL40B2 beamline in SPring-8 (Hyogo, ° Japan) using a wavelength of 1.0 A. All data collection was performed at 100 K. Diffraction data sets were processed with the program DPS/Mosflm28 and SCALA in the CCP4 program package.29 The statistics of data collection are summarized in Table 1.

Structure determination and refinement The native structure was determined at a resolution ° of 1.9 A by the molecular replacement method using the structure of the TVAII10 as a search model with the program AMoRe30 in the CCP4 program package. The substrate-complexed structures were determined by the same method using the native structure as a search model. The models were refined with the program CNS,31 and manual model corrections were performed with the program O.32 The statistics of refinement are given in Table 1.

Protein Data Bank accession numbers The atomic coordinates and structure factors of the native form and complexes with panose, maltotetraose and isopanose have been deposited in the RCS Protein Data Bank33 under accession codes 1J0H, 1J0I, 1J0J, and 1J0K, respectively.
