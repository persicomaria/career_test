11 -Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 -HSD1) catalyzes the conversion of 11dehydrocorticosterone to its active form corticosterone in rodents (or cortisone to cortisol in humans). The reductive reaction of the 11-keto to 11-hydroxyl is the pivotal switch in the activation of glucocorticoids. An excess of active glucocorticoids has been shown to play a key role in metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. Therefore, 11 -HSD1 represents an important therapeutic target for the treatment of these diseases. To facilitate the iterative design of inhibitors, we have crystallized and determined the three-dimensional structures of a binary complex of murine 11 -HSD1 with NADP(H) to a resolution of 2.3 Å and of a ternary complex with corticosterone and NADP(H) to a resolution of 3.0 Å by X-ray crystallography. The enzyme forms a homodimer in the crystal and has a fold similar to those of other members of the family of short chain steroid dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs). The structure shows a novel folding feature at the C-terminus of the enzyme. The C-terminal helix insertions provide additional dimer contacts, exert an influence on the conformations of the substrate binding loops, and present hydrophobic regions for potential membrane attachment. The structure also reveals how 11 -HSD1 achieves its selectivity for its substrate.

ABSTRACT:

Glucocorticoids play important roles in a variety of physiological and cellular processes, including the regulation of metabolic enzymes, inflammatory responses, and blood pressure (1-3). The active hydroxyl form of glucocorticoids binds to nuclear receptors and subsequently influences gene transcriptions. The two isoforms of 11 -HSDs catalyze the interconversion between the 11-keto forms and the active 11-hydroxyl forms of glucocorticoids (Figure 1). Type 1 acts as a reductase, whereas type 2 acts as a dehydrogenase. A level of cortisol regulation is achieved by the differential tissue distribution of the two isoforms. 11 -HSD11 is expressed predominantly in liver, adipose, and brain, and type 2 is expressed mostly in kidney. A variety of diseases, including insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity, are induced by glucocorticoid excess. The therapeutic potential of 11 -HSD1 inhibition has been demonstrated by gene knockout and transgenic mouse models (4). Specifically, 11 -HSD1 null mice were found to resist high-fat diet-induced obesity. An

improved lipid and lipoprotein profile, hepatic insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance have also been reported for the 11 -HSD1 gene knockout mice (5). The phenotype of transgenic mice overexpressing 11 -HSD1 selectively in adipose tissue has shown marked insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia (4). Further studies of these transgenics also linked overexpression of 11 -HSD1 to hypertension (6). 11 HSD1 inhibitors have been synthesized and shown to be able to lower the expression levels of gluconeogenic enzymes and blood glucose and thus provide some degree of validation for the therapeutic potential of this class of inhibitors (7). Improving the potency and pharamaceutical properties of 11 -HSD1 inhibitors will be critical for the successful discovery of effective human therapeutic agents. 11 -HSD1 belongs to the SDR family of enzymes and uses NADPH as a cofactor. This family is characterized by a consensus GXXXGXG nucleotide binding motif and a conserved S-Y-K catalytic triad. Only the tyrosine residue is completely invariant. While most SDRs are soluble enzymes, 11 -HSD1 is linked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by an N-terminal single transmembrane segment with the catalytic domain localized in the lumen of the ER (8, 9). Although native 11 -HSD1 is glycosylated, the unglycosylated enzyme is fully active (10). 11 -HSD1 possesses some unusual enzymatic properties. Although it acts as a reductase in vivo, it is bidirectional in vitro. The unidirectional function in vivo is a consequence of the high local concentration of the NADPH cofactor regenerated by hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (11). 11 -

FIGURE 1: Reaction scheme in vivo. 11 -HSD1 acts as an oxoreductase converting dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone in rodents and cortisone to cortisol in humans using NADPH as a cofactor. 11 -HSD2 acts as a dehydrogenase catalyzing the reverse reaction using NAD as a cofactor. Dehydrocorticosterone and cortisone are the inert forms of the hormone, whereas corticosterone and cortisol are the active forms of the hormone.

HSD1 has a low affinity for its substrate. The reported Km of the enzyme, ranging from low micromolar to submicromolar values, is higher than the low nanomolar freecirculating substrate concentration (12, 13). One explanation for this paradox is that the local concentration of the substrate is higher at the ER membrane. The biophysical characterization of the enzyme has yielded controversial results on the oligomerization state of the active enzyme due to the complications resulting from the presence of detergent for this membrane-associated protein. Both dimeric and tetrameric forms of the enzymes have been observed in solution (12, 14). Here we present the structures of the catalytic domain of murine 11 -HSD1 bound to NADP(H) in the presence and absence of the product corticosterone. The structure reveals a unique arrangement of the two C-terminal helices relative to other SDRs. These helices make additional cross-subunit interface contacts, and contribute to the conformations of the substrate binding segments. They also contain a cluster of hydrophobic residues on the protein surface that might be embedded in the membrane lipid bilayers. The atomic structure will aid in understanding the molecular basis for steroid recognition and in the structure-based drug design of potent and selective inhibitors of 11 -HSD1. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Expression and Purification. Murine 11 -HSD1 (residues 24-292) is expressed in Escherichia coli with a His6 tag at the amino terminus. A PCR fragment comprising residues 24-292 (GENPEPT entry S75207) was amplified and subcloned into the NdeI-XhoI sites of a proprietary plasmid expression vector (15). PCR primers were designed to generate a gene fragment encoding residues 24-292 with addition of a 5 NdeI site and a 3 XhoI site. The 5 primer also added coding sequence downstream of the NdeI site for the histidine tag. The amplified PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and subcloned into the plasmid expression vector. Fermentation of E. coli containing the

DNA sequence-confirmed plasmid was carried out at 37 °C during the initial growth phase and then shifted to 20 °C for chemical induction. Cell paste was suspended in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM benzamidine. The cell suspension was broken with two passes through a microfluidizer, and mixed with a buffer containing 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mM imidazole. The mixture was loaded on a NiNTA column. The Ni-NTA eluate was concentrated and processed by size exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S200, Pharmacia) in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton, 5% glycerol, and 2 mM EDTA. The pool from the S200 column was concentrated and frozen at -80 °C. A frozen sample was thawed and passed through a Pierce Extracti-Gel D column using the same buffer without the detergent at room temperature and concentrated to 25 mg/ mL for crystallization experiments. Crystallization and Data Collection. The enzyme was crystallized by the vapor diffusion method using hanging drops. The protein sample was mixed with an equal volume of well solution of 1.8 M Li2SO4 and 0.1 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) at room temperature. The crystals belong to space group P4122 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit with the following cell dimensions: a ) b ) 96.72 Å and c ) 219.30 Å. A heavy atom derivative of the crystal was obtained by adding 1 mM ethylmercuric chloride to the crystal drop. The ternary complex was obtained by soaking 0.05 mM corticosterone and 1 mM NADPH into the crystal. Data were collected at beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source using an ADSCQ315 detector and processed using HKL2000 (16). The cell dimensions for the ternary complex are close to the native crystal: a ) b ) 96.99 Å and c ) 218.15 Å. The data statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structure Solution and Refinement. The phases were obtained by single isomorphous replacement with the anomalous signal method using SOLVE (17). The overall figure of merit (from 40 to 2.5 Å) was 0.3. The electron density map was further improved using DM in the CCP4

The model was refined using CNX (19), and the refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. RESULTS OVerall Fold of the Subunits. The final model contains two monomers that form a homodimer. There is clear electron density for residues 25-289 for each monomer. Representative electron density maps are shown in Figure 2 with the atoms labeled for the two different structure solutions. The CR trace of one monomer is shown in Figure 3. The overall fold is similar to those of other SDR family members (20). The consensus fold consists of the central seven-stranded parallel -sheet, flanked by six parallel R-helices (Figure 3). There are four short R-helix insertions relative to the consensus fold (Figure 4): REF (residues 171-174) between RE and RF, RFG (residues 220-228) between F and RG, and two sequential helices (RH1 and RH2) following G. The RFG insertion is also part of the substrate entry loop (residues 216-231). Helices RH1 and RH2 are located at the C-terminus of the enzyme. The pseudo-2-fold axis places the amino termini on the same face of the dimer so that the amino-terminal residues for each chain point in the same direction toward the membrane. The orientation of the N-termini makes it possible for the cluster of the solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues on C-terminal helices RH1 and RH2 to become embedded in the membrane. Contrary to previous studies (8), none of the cysteine residues form disulfide bonds. The closest approach of the cysteines is made by C213 and C241, but the sulfur atoms are more than 8 Å apart. Subunit Interface. The enzyme was crystallized with a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The structures of the two

subunits superimpose well on each other with an rms deviation of 0.24 Å for the backbone atoms in the NADP(H) complex and an rms deviation of 0.31 Å for the ternary complex. The two subunits are related by a pseudo-2-fold axis, designated as the Q-axis using the convention described by Ghosh (21) (Figure 5). The total buried surface area of the dimer interface is large, 5129 Å2. Although RH1 and RH2 do not make direct contacts with the substrate, they make intimate interactions with two of the substrate binding loops in the other subunit. This is in contrast to the 7R-HSD structure in which the C-terminus wraps back on the same subunit and forms part of the substrate-binding site (22). Helices RH1 and RH2 in 11 HSD1 may support the substrate binding loops to adopt the proper conformations to accommodate the substrate. The segment of residues 273-284 (RH2) interacts with the REFRF turn (residues 174-178) in the substrate binding loop (residues 170-183) as described below. The segment of residues 283-288 (RH2) makes contacts with residues 231233 (RFG-RG loop), the C-terminal residues of the substrate

entry loop (residues 216-231). The only major interactions of helices RH1 and RH2 with the same subunit are between two nitrogens of the guanidinium group of R273 in RH2 and the two carboxylate oxygens of D191 in RF. C-Terminal cross-subunit contacts have also been observed for two other SDRs, 17 -HSD (23) and (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogease (25). As in the Q-axis interfaces in other SDRs, the 11 -HSD1 dimer interface also consists of a four-helix bundle of RE and RF from each monomer. In addition to the helix-helix interactions, helix-loop packing also occurs at the interface. Four segments are involved in the intermolecular contacts: 127-152 ( D-RE turn and RE), 174-204 (REF-RF turn and RF), 229-233 (RFG-RG turn), and 267-288 (RH1 and RH2) (Figure 5). The D-RE turn (F129) packs against RF; the REF-RF turn (residues 174-178) packs against RH2, and the REF-RF turn (residues 176-179) packs against RF. Cofactor NADP(H) Binding Site. In the crystals grown without the addition of corticosterone, an NADP(H) molecule was bound in the enzyme (Figure 2b), even though no additional NADP(H) was added during the protein purification or crystallization process. The conformation and orientation of NADP(H) are very similar to those found in other SDRs, shown in Figure 3. It sits in a cleft formed by seven segments of the enzyme: residues 41-46, 65 and 66, 9193, 119-121, 168 and 169, 183-187, and 215-222 (Figure 3 and Table 2). The NADP(H) makes extensive polar and charged interactions with the enzyme, as shown in Table 2 and Figure 6. The hydrophobic interactions are mostly through the nicotinamide and adenine portions of the cofactor. The nicotinamide makes contacts with the corticosterone and the side chain of L215. The orientations of the nicotinamide and adenine are also stabilized through polar or charged interactions as shown in Table 2. The side chain R66 neutralizes the negative charge of the 2-phosphate of NADP(H) and makes hydrophobic stacking interactions with the adenine of NADP(H). However, in human 17 -HSD (26), the 2-

phosphate neutralizing arginine residue at the equivalent position does not have the stacking interaction with the adenine group. In the trihydroxynaphthalene reductase structure, R39 that comes from a different structural element interacts with the 2-phosphate of NADPH (27). While it appears that a neutralizing arginine residue interacting with the 2-phosphate of NADPH is required to distinguish whether an SDR will use NADPH or NADH as a cofactor, the arginine residue can occur at different locations in the primary sequence. The backbone atoms of the 215LGLI218 loop in 11 -HSD1 form four hydrogen bonds with the nicotinamide of the cofactor: L215 O and C5N (3.4 Å), G216 O and C4N (3.0 Å), I218 N and O7N (2.7 Å), and I218 O and N7N (3.3 Å). Hydride transfer occurs on C4 of nicotinamide in the pro-S configuration during catalysis. Therefore, the conserved interaction of the backbone carbonyl group of G216 with the pro-R hydrogen of C4 of the nicotinamide has been suggested to be important for catalysis (28). The Pro-Gly sequence, equivalent to L215 and G216 of 11 -HSD1, is preferred for SDR enzymes. Although this sequence has variations, the three hydrogen bonds between C4N, O7N, and N7N of the nicotinamide and the enzyme backbone atoms have been observed in all the known SDR structures. The backbone carbonyl group of L215 also forms a hydrogen bond with the L171 backbone nitrogen atom. Most of the SDR enzymes also have similar hydrogen bonds such as L215 in 11 -HSD1: the carbonyl group of L215 with the backbone nitrogen atom of the residue after the catalytic serine and with C5 of nicotinamide. However, L215 interactions do not appear to be essential for catalysis, because in the structure of the rat (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, equivalent interactions of L215 are absent (25). The catalytic residue K187 makes bifurcated hydrogen bonds with O4 and O5 of the nicotinamide ribose, whereas the OH group of catalytic residue Y183 is hydrogen bonded with O5 of the same ribose. Similar interactions have been observed in most known SDR structures. This is consistent

with the catalytic mechanism in which K187 maintains the orientation of the nicotinamide ribose and aids in deprotonation of the hydroxyl of Y183 (22). Substrate-Binding Site. For both structures determined in the presence and absence of corticosterone, there is strong electron density in the substrate-binding site (Figure 2a). In the structure grown in the absence of substrate, a detergent molecule is observed and was modeled as an eight-carbon chain bound in the steroid-binding site with an extended conformation leading toward the bulk solvent. For the crystals soaked with corticosterone, the molecule is clearly visible in the difference density maps. We presume that it is still in the reduced state because excess NADPH (1 mM) was added with corticosterone (0.05 mM) to form the ternary complex. The resolution of these structures is not sufficient to determine the oxidation state of the reactants. They can be modeled into the electron density equally well in either oxidation state. The lack of a structural preference for the substrate or product is consistent with the reversibility of the enzyme. In the corticosterone complex structure, the corticosterone is positioned between three substrate-binding segments of the protein: residues 121-126 ( D-RE turn), 170-183

(REG, REF-RF turn, and RF), and 216-231 ( F-RFG turn, RFG, and RFG-RG turn). The detailed interactions are shown in Figure 6. The corticosterone is mostly buried with only 13% of its surface accessible to the solvent. The polar oxygens at opposite sides of the substrate are open to solvent by two different channels. The possible hydrogen bonds are listed in Table 2. The R-side of the corticosterone interacts with residues G216, L217, T220, T222, A223, E226, I227, and I231 of the substrate entry loop of residues 216-231, and the nicotinamide from the cofactor. The total buried surface area between the substrate and NADP(H) is 65 Å2. The R-side of corticosterone makes contacts with I121, T124, and L126 from the binding loop of residues 121-126 and S170, L171, A172, Q177, I180, and Y183 from the binding loop of residues 170-183. The hydroxyl groups of catalytic residues S170 and Y183 interact directly with the O11 atom of corticosterone. O21 and O20 hold a trans conformation in the refined model. This orientation was the best fit to the original electron density maps and maintained that orientation throughout subsequent refinement. It should be noted that the trans conformation in steroids has not been observed before. Considering the medium resolution of the X-ray data,

3.0 Å, we cannot rule out the possibility that O21 may hold an energetically more favorable cis conformation with respect to O20. The energy loss due to the missing intramolecular hydrogen bond of O21 and O20 in the trans conformation may be compensated by favorable interactions with the cofactor. O21 acts as both a hydrogen bond acceptor from N7N of the nicotinamide and a hydrogen bond donor to the O1N atom of the NADPH. Although SDRs share a similar fold, their substrate-binding loops and the C-terminus of the enzyme have shown the most divergent conformations. Consequently, the overall shape, solvent accessible regions, and polar composition of the steroid-binding groove are very different among SDR

members. While the pocket is composed of mostly hydrophobic residues, the hydroxyl groups of Y183 and S170 and the backbone nitrogen atoms of L171 and A172 provide potential polar interactions with inhibitors. The two solvent channels on either end of the steroid-binding site provide regions where inhibitor design efforts may be exploited. The REF R-turn (residues 171-174) immediately following the catalytic residue S170 exists in all known SDR structures that contain a catalytic serine residue. It was first described in the structure of rat (3R)-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogease (29). The SDRs that do not contain the catalytic serine residues, e.g., enonyl-ACP reductase (30), also lack the REF R-turn. In the 11 -HSD1-corticosterone structure, the hydroxyl group of S170 forms two possible hydrogen bonds with two backbone nitrogen atoms, L171 N (2.7 Å) and A172 N (3.2 Å) in REF. These two backbone amide groups serve as hydrogen bond donors to the S170 hydroxyl group and position the proton of the OH group of S170 close to the 11 -oxygen of the corticosterone. This important proton network suggests that the REF turn plays an essential role in catalysis. This is consistent with the structural conservation of REF among the SDRs with an S-Y-K catalytic triad. The residues of the steroid-binding sites show minimal movement upon binding of substrate. The only significant

conformational change is that the hydroxyl group of S170 turns 90° toward the corticosterone and forms a hydrogen bond. It forms four possible polar interactions with L171 N (3.4 Å), A172 N (3.4 Å), G173 N (4.0 Å), and Y183 OH (3.1 Å) in the absence of the substrate. It might be possible that after catalysis occurs, a hydrogen bond also forms between the OH groups of catalytic residues S170 and Y183 so that the interactions between the enzyme and product are weakened to facilitate the process of the product leaving the active site. In the SRD enzyme family, the segment containing residues 216-231 is called the substrate entry loop because it often adopts different conformations in structures with and without substrate. In the 11 -HSD1 structures reported here, the substrate entry loop does not change conformations when the reaction product is soaked in. One reason might be that the detergent molecule in the substrate site holds the substrate entry loop close to the steroid-bound conformation. Alternatively, it might be that the crystal lattice prevents dramatic conformational changes since the structure is obtained by soaking in the product. The rms deviation of structures with or without corticosterone is only 0.12 Å. For many other SDR family members, two proline residues are postulated as the hinges for the movement of the substrate entry loop as in E. coli 7R-HSD (22). However, in 11 -HSD1, there are no corresponding prolines. Comparison of the Murine and Human Structures. The murine and human enzymes share virtually identical folds and dimeric organization (Figure 7a). The rms deviation of the CR atoms of the murine and the human dimers (molecules A and B from PDB entry 1XU7) is only 0.46 Å. The two subunits of the murine dimer are more similar, with a CR rms deviation of only 0.13 Å, whereas the CR rms deviation of the two subunits of the human dimer is 0.42 Å. The larger difference results from the different conformations of the segment of residues 228-233 in the human enzyme. The segment of residues 228-233 in the mouse enzyme is aligned well with molecule B of the human enzyme and takes

different conformations with molecule A of the human enzyme. This segment is part of the substrate entry loop and has been observed to be the most flexible in most SDRs. The corresponding residues surrounding NAPDH in the human enzyme are almost identical to those in the murine enzyme with only one conservative substitution at position 168: an isoleucine residue in mouse and a valine residue in human (Figure 7b). Although the natural substrates for human and murine 11 HSD1 are different by an additional hydroxyl group in the C17R position, the active site residues are mostly conserved. There are five amino acid substitutions (Figures 4 and 7b) with most of them being conservative substitutions: isoleucines at positions 180, 277, and 231 in the murine enzyme and valines in the human enzyme. The substitution closest to the C17 position of the substrate is residue 226. The side chain of E226 in the human enzyme points toward the solvent, and the C atom is aligned well with the C atom of A226 in the mouse enzyme. The largest difference is Q177 in mouse, and Y177 in human enzyme, but this residue is not near the C17 position. Despite the fact that the different species utilize slightly different forms of the steroid, there are comparable kinetics for the human enzyme using the mouse substrate and the mouse enzyme will recognize the human substrate. The Km for cortisone in the mouse enzyme is 842.6 ( 130.8 nM, and the Km for the human enzyme is 696.6 ( 339.5 nM (unpublished data). The slight difference in the Km of cortisone is consistent with the small changes in the substrate-binding site residues. There are no obvious clashes when the human substrate is modeled into the mouse active site; therefore, the murine 11 -HSD1 structure is a reliable model for the design of inhibitors of the human enzyme. Most of the conserved residues have similar orientations between the murine and human enzymes with only one exception for S170 (Figure 7b), which has been shown to be able to take different conformations in the murine enzyme upon substrate binding.

FIGURE 7: (a) Stereoview of the superimposition of CR atoms of the murine and human 11 -HSD1. The CR atoms of the murine and human enzymes are colored blue and purple, respectively. NADPH and corticosterone in the murine complex are colored blue. The two segments that have a more pronounced structural difference, residues 228-233 and 263-268, are labeled. The CR atoms in these segments of the murine enzyme are represented by spheres. (b) Stereoview of the steroid-binding site of the superimposed murine and human structures. Carbon atoms of the murine are colored blue and the human atoms purple. The steroid carbon atoms from the murine structure are colored yellow. The five nonconserved active site residues are indicated with the human residue in parentheses. The conserved serine 170 position is shown for the murine structure as complexed with the steroid. The conformation of the human serine 170 occupies a similar position as the murine binary structure in the absence of the steroid.

DISCUSSION The structures of the murine 11 -HSD1 complexes reported here provide a detailed analysis of the substrate recognition and structural elements for catalysis. 11 -HSD1 has been widely recognized as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of a variety of diseases such as diabetes type II, obesity, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. The distinctive steroid-binding site revealed by the structure makes the enzyme an ideal target for structure-based inhibitor design. The arrangement of the C-terminal helix insertions, RH1 and RH2, is unique compared with the arrangements of other SDR family members. They play multiple roles in maintaining the enzyme structure. They form an extensive dimer interface, and interact with the substrate-binding loops. More importantly, they present a large continuous hydrophobic region on the protein surface for potential interactions with the membrane lipid bilayer. The recently reported human 11 -HSD1 structure shows virtually the same fold as the mouse enzyme in both monomeric and dimeric forms (14). A tetramer of the enzyme of the human enzyme was found in one crystallographic asymmetric unit and was proposed to be the functional unit in vivo. In the murine enzyme, a crystallographic 2-fold axis perpendicular to the pseudo-2-fold axis of the dimer gives rise to a similar tetrameric organization. C-terminal helices

RH1 and RH2 from each monomer form a pseudo-four-helix bundle in this interface. Consequently, the hydrophobic region on the protein surface from the C-terminal helix insertions becomes buried in this interface. Membrane-associated proteins are known to aggregate in solutions, so the observed dimer-dimer formation of the murine enzyme in the crystal lattice may be an artifact in vitro. The total buried area in the Q-axis dimer interface, 5129 Å2, is consistent with other known interfaces; however, the buried area of the dimer-dimer interface is only 618 Å2 which is comparable to that formed by crystal lattice contacts. In a study of protein interactions, the smallest observed protein dimer interface was 1150 Å2 (31). Given the very small contact area in the dimer-dimer interface, it is likely that the enzyme exists as a dimer with C-terminal helices buried in the membrane lipid bilayer while the enzyme is linked to the ER membrane. The proximity of the enzyme to the membrane suggests that a potentially higher substrate concentration in the ER membrane by metabolism can drive the catalysis even though the enzyme has low affinity for its substrate. Interestingly, the C-terminal helix insertions that make extra dimer contacts result in an unusually large interface, 5129 Å2, 18.8% of the molecular surface. The "large" contact area in protein dimers ranges from 2000 to 4600 Å2 according to a study of protein structures dated to 1998 (31).

6956 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 18, 2005 The large contact area might be needed as a fail-safe mechanism to ensure that dimer formation is not disrupted by the presence of a nearby membrane lipid. The short REF R-helix following the catalytic serine residue is a conserved structural element for SDRs containing the S-Y-K catalytic triad. We propose that the REF helix may play a crucial role in positioning the hydroxyl group of catalytic residue S170 and thus be essential for catalysis. It will be interesting to see whether future SDR structures maintain the correlation between the presence of an REF segment and the catalytic serine in the S-Y-K triad. Despite the fact that the natural ligands for mouse and human 11 -HSD1 are different, the murine structure will provide a reliable model for the design of inhibitors for the human enzyme. There are relatively few amino acid changes in the active site. Moreover, we have identified a number of inhibitors that do cross react (unpublished data). Selectivity between 11 -HSD1 and 11 -HSD2 is also essential for human therapeutic use because they are antagonistic to each other in vivo. Although some inhibitors such as glycyrrhetinic acid and carbenoxolone can inhibit both enzymes, most of the reported 11 -HSD1 inhibitors are selective for type 1 over type 2 (32, 33). This is expected because there is only 15% sequence identity between 11 -HSD1 and 11 -HSD2. This set of structure determinations provides significant aid in the design of potent and selective inhibitors of 11 -HSD1 for the treatment of a number of human diseases. We have developed a system in which the detergent molecule can be replaced by a ligand in the crystal, so it is now possible to soak in novel inhibitors for an efficient iterative rational drug design process.
