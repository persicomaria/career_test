Chemosensory Proteins (CSPs) represent a family of conserved proteins found in insects that may be involved in chemosensory functions. BmorCSP1 is expressed mainly in antennae and legs of the silkworm moth Bombyx mori and was cloned from antennal cDNA. Here we report the determination of the structure of Bombyx mori CSP1 (BmorCSP1) by NMR. The overall fold of BmorCSP1 is globular and comprises six -helices. These helices span residues 10­14, 17­27, 35­49, 57­72, 75­85, and 92­100. The internal hydrophobic sides of the helices are formed mostly by leucine and isoleucine residues and, therefore, well suited to constitute a binding site for hydrophobic ligands. Arch.

INTRODUCTION
In insects, two different soluble protein groups have been identified in the antennal lymph. The first group comprises the odorant binding proteins (OBPs). These proteins are approximately 150 residues long, contain six highly conserved cysteines forming three disulfide bridges, and are involved in the binding of pheromones and odorant molecules (Vogt and Riddiford, 1981, 1986; Vogt et al., 1985). The second group is formed by chemosensory proteins (CSPs; Angeli et al., 1999). CSPs are smaller proteins of around 110 amino acids that contain only four cysteines linked by two disul-

fide bridges (McKenna et al., 1994; Pikielny et al., 1994, Angeli et al., 1999). The disulfide bridges are arranged differently in OBPs and CSPs; they are interhelical in OBPs and rigidify the structure (Leal et al., 1999; Scaloni et al., 1999) whereas they form two small loops in CSPs that do not rigidify the structure (Angeli et al., 1999). The signature motif of CSPs is CX6CX18CX2C (Maleszka and Stange, 1997). The first proposed role of CSPs was based on their tissue localization. They are mainly expressed in chemosensory sensillae in antennae, legs, proboscis, and other chemosensory organs and thus they have been attributed a role in carrying chemo-

sensory or gustatory molecules (Maleszka and Stange, 1997; Angeli et al., 1999). However, no binding to taste or odor molecules has yet been demonstrated (Angeli et al., 1999; Ban et al., 2002; Jin et al., 2005). On the other hand, binding to pheromone compounds and fatty acids has been shown in Mamestra brassicae (Bohbot et al., 1998; Jacquin-Joly et al., 2001; Lartigue et al., 2002; Campanacci et al., 2003) and in Apis mellifera (Briand et al., 2002). Moreover, they have a role in solubilizing cuticular hydrocarbons in ants (Ozaki et al., 2005). Thus, the role of CSPs can be extended to carrier proteins for hydrophobic ligands. The striking feature of CSPs is their diversity within and between the different insect species (Wanner et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2006). Three classes of CSPs that share 50% identity and differ by their localization within the insect body have been found in Schistocerca gregaria (Angeli et al., 1999; Jin et al., 2005). The same diversity has been found in other insect species including Bombyx mori, Heliothis virescens, and A. mellifera (Picimbon et al., 2000, 2001; Forêt et al., 2007; Gong et al., 2007). Moreover, CSPs are differently expressed during development in Drosophila melanogaster, A. mellifera, and Chroistoneura fumiferana, and their expression can be regulated by ecdysone (Sabatier et al., 2003; Wanner et al., 2005; Forêt et al., 2007). In A. mellifera, CSP5 is implied in integument synthesis during embryogenesis (Maleszka et al., 2007). CSPs are also induced in response to viral infection or to sceptic injury in D. melanogaster or in the regenerating legs in Periplaneta americana (Kitabayashi et al., 1998; Sabatier et al., 2003) suggesting a role of some CSPs in tissue development and remodeling. An important step towards understanding the physiological role(s) of CSPs at the molecular level is the determination of their three-dimensional structure. So far, only two CSP structures have been determined, the CSPA6 from M. brassicae (CSPMbraA6 also called CSP2; Lartigue et al., 2002; Mosbah et al., 2003; Campanacci et al., 2003) and the CSPsg4 from S. gregaria (Tomaselli et al., 2006). CSPMbraA6 is localized in antennae and proboscis in M. brassicae (Bohbot et al.,

1998; Nagnan-Le Meillour et al., 2000; JacquinJoly et al., 2001) and CSPsg4 is localized in antenna and other chemosensory organs in S. gregaria (Angeli et al., 1999). Both proteins have a similar structure consisting of six -helices forming two parallel arches closed at the bottom by a helix and forming a ligand binding pocket able to accomodate long carbon chains of fatty acids (Campanacci et al., 2001, 2003; Lartigue et al., 2002; Mosbah et al., 2003; Tomaselli et al., 2006). The genome of B. mori has been sequenced (Mita et al., 2004; Xia et al., 2004). In B. mori, 15 CSPs have been identified (Gong et al., 2007). The CSP1 of B. mori (BmorCSP1) has a molecular weight of 12,895 Da (Picimbon et al., 2000). BmorCSP1 shares 70% identity with CSPMbraA6, but these two proteins differ by their tissue localization. CSPMbraA6 is localized in antennae and proboscis, whereas BmorCSP1 is expressed mainly in male and female antennae and legs but it is also found at lower amounts in thorax and abdomen (Picimbon et al., 2000). Therefore, moderate structural variations may have resulted in different physiological roles of these proteins as suggested by their differential tissue localization. Here we report the determination of the solution structure of BmorCSP1 by NMR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Cloning of BmorCSP1
The BmorCSP1 gene was amplified by PCR on antennal cDNA from B. mori, obtained as described earlier (Picimbon et al., 2000). The sense 5 GGTACCGACGACGACGACAAGGATGATAAGTACACT 3 and antisense 5 CTCGAGTCATTCAGGGATGACGATGCCCTTGGCCTT 3 primers were used. These primers included two restriction sites, KpnI in 5 and XhoI in 3 and an enterokinase site in 5. BmorCSP1 was subcloned in the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid was digested by KpnI and XhoI (New England Biolabs) during 4 h at 37°C, and the insert was ligated into pET32a vector (Novagen) overnight at 16°C. The resulting plasmid, pET32a-CSP1 was sequenced and shown to encode the mature BmorCSP1.

Expression and Purification of BmorCSP1
The plasmid containing the correct BmorCSP1 sequence was cloned into Escherichia coli BL21. Single colonies were grown in 5 ml LB medium containing 100 mg/l ampicilin overnight. The 5ml cultures were used to inoculate M9 medium supplied with 2 g/l [13C]-glucose and 1 g/l [15N]NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA) and bacteria were grown at 37°C. When the optical density reached 0.6, the expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropylthio-D-galactoside (IPTG) and the protein was expressed for 4 h at 37°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mM phosphate buffer, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, and lysed by sonication. BmorCSP1 was purified on Ni2+ chelated resin. The crude lysate extract was applied onto the column, the column was washed with the purification buffer (20 mM phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), and the protein was eluted with 10 mM imidazole. The protein was concentrated and the thioredoxin hexahistidine part was removed by enterokinase cleavage (Invitrogen), using 0.66 enterokinase units per mg protein, overnight at 4°C, followed by a second purification on the Ni2+ chelated resin. Purified BmorCSP1 was dialysed overnight at 4°C in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and concentrated to 1 mM. The size and purity of the protein were checked by SDS-PAGE analysis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

NMR Structure Determination
The NMR samples consisted of 1.0 mM 13C,15Nlabeled BmorCSP1 in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 50 µM sodium azide and 10% deuterium oxide. All NMR spectra were recorded at 20°C on Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer, equipped with the cryogenic 1H/13C/15N TCI probehead. Backbone assignments were obtained from the standard triple-resonance experiments (Sattler et al., 1999), including HNCACB, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH (optimized for NH and NH2), HN(CO)CA, and HNCO. Aliphatic and aromatic side-chain assignments were based on HCCHTOCSY spectra. A simultaneously 13C,15N-edited NOESY spectrum (Xia et al., 2003) with the 13C carrier frequency of 26 ppm and 13C-edited NOESY spectrum with the 13C carrier frequency of 126 ppm were recorded using the mixing time of 120 ms. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were extracted from 1H-15N IPAP-HSQC (Ottiger et al., 1998), v HN[C]-S3E (Zídek et al., 2001) and coupled HNCO (Grzesiek and Bax, 1992) spectra, measured on the isotropic sample, described above, and on a comparable sample aligned with 15 mg/ml filamentous phage Pf1. The spectra were processed using NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995) and analyzed using Sparky (T.D. Goddard and D.G. Kneller, UCSF, San Francisco, CA). Chemical shifts were indirectly referenced to DSS (1H and 13C) and liquid ammonia (15N). Torsion angle restraints were determined from the chemical shift values analyzed by the program TALOS (Cornilescu et al., 1999). Distance restraints were assigned, calibrated, and structures were calculated using program ARIA 2.0 (Habeck et al., 2004) utilizing CNS 1.1 (Brünger et al., 1998). Program CNS 1.1 (Brünger et al., 1998) was also used for structure refinement. The following refinement protocols were used in this study: Protocol A was based on the default setup of the program and used TALOS dihedral angles, hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds, and NOE distances assigned by ARIA-2.0. Protocol B differed by employing RDC restraints using module ISAC (Sass et al., 2001). Based on preliminary tests, the final value of the force constant of the RDC term was set to

MALDI-TOF MS Analysis
Mass spectra of the protein were recorded on a Reflex IV (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) operated in the linear mode with detection of positive ions. Sinapinic acid (Sigma) was used as a matrix. Saturated matrix solution was prepared in 1% trifuoroacetic acid of 50% acetonitrile solution. Protein samples were mixed with the matrix solution in a ratio 1:2. Equine myoglobin (Sigma) was used for internal mass calibration. The XMASS 5.1.5 software (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) was used for data processing.

0.3. Protocol C used the CNS input scripts obtained from the authors of the RECOORD database (Nederveen et al., 2005) and the same set of restraints as Protocol A. Programs PROCHECK-NMR (Laskowski et al., 1996) and WHATIF (Vriend, 1990) were used to check quality of the calculated structures. The calculated structures were visualized and analyzed using MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996). Program PASS (Brady and Stouten, 2000) was used to identify internal cavities in the protein structures. The coordinates of ten calculated structures with the lowest energy and the experimental restraints were deposited at the Protein Data Bank at RCSB (http:// www. rcsb.org/pdb/) as entry 2JNT.

RESULTS
Recombinant BmorCSP1 was expressed as a thioredoxin-fused precursor. Cleavage of the thioredixin tag occurred specifically between Lys 3 and Tyr 4 of the native CSP1 as shown by MALDI-TOF mass spectra (Fig. 1). The observed mass of (12,534 ± 3) Da (obtained by internal calibration using bovine myoglobin, data not shown) corresponded well to the theoretical mass of the proposed cleavage product (12,534 Da). In this report, the residue numbering starts at the N-terminal tyrosine.

The total yield of purified protein was 12 mg per liter medium. As the protein sample aged, some degradation of the protein was revealed by additional peaks in the mass spectra. Therefore, after a week of measurement the protein was replaced with a fresh sample. NMR measurements were performed as described in Materials and Methods. Almost complete resonance assignment was obtained and deposited in the BioMagResBank (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu) under Accession No. 6943, as reported previously (Jansen et al., 2006). Analysis of the chemical shifts using the program TALOS (Cornilescu et al., 1999) showed that most of the residues are present in a helical conformation. The identified secondary structures were restrained by 41 hydrogen bonds (represented by 82 distance restraints) and torsion angles determined by TALOS in all structure calculations. The list of NOE distances was obtained in two successive runs of ARIA 2.0, each consisting of eight iterations and of the refinement with the explicit solvent. The default protocol was used, with the exception of the simulated annealing time, which was doubled. A set of 67 manually selected longrange NOEs and a set of 78 long-range NOEs selected from the output of the first run were used as starting values in the first and second ARIA 2.0 run, respectively. The refinement was performed

using the protocols described in Materials and Methods. First, 100 structures were calculated using Protocol A. The electrostatic interactions and explicit solvent molecules were not included in the preliminary calculations. Ten structures with the lowest total energy were then analyzed. The orientation of the helices was further investigated by employing the RDCs (Protocol B). In order to minimize the effect of experimental error, only 37 most reliable RDCs were selected as restraints. The selection was based on checking the internal consistency of RDCs within the peptide bond plane v (Zídek et al., 2003) and/or in the regular helices (Mesleh and Opella, 2003). The use of Protocol B resulted in a substantial increase of the correlation coefficient (to 0.989) for the back-calculated vs. experimental RDCs. The structure quality, assessed by PROCHECK-NMR and WHATIF, did not change significantly from structures calculated by Protocol A. No deformation of the covalent geometry and no violations of the distance restraints were observed in the structures refined using Protocol B. In order to improve quality of the calculated structures, the CNS input scripts from the authors of the RECOORD database (Nederveen et al., 2005) were used in the final refinement (Protocol C). As the use of the RDCs was not implemented in the input scripts, the RDC restraints were not used in Protocol C. A total number of 750 structures has been calculated; 50 of them were further minimized using water molecules as an explicit solvent. A bundle of ten final structures with the lowest energy is shown in Figure 2. Statistics of the final structure calculations is summarized in Table 1. The quality of the structures refined using Protocol C was significantly improved in comparison to the structures obtained by Protocols A and B. Ten structures

with the lowest energy provided satisfactory WHATIF Z-scores for all parameters, with the exception of the Ramachandran distribution and backbone conformation (see Table 1). All residues in the generously allowed and disallowed regions were of the poorly defined N-terminal region, with the exception of a loop residue W 91 and disulfide-bonded C 55. Figure 3 shows comparison of helix orientation in the structures refined using Protocol C with the structures calculated with the RDC restraints (Protocol B). In spite of the large effect on the correlation between the back-calculated and experimental RDCs, the structures differ only slightly (deviations of the helical axes less than 6° and RMSD of 0.74 Å between the backbone heavy atoms in the helices of the average structures calculated from ten lowest energy structures in each set). As the quality of the structures was greatly improved when Protocol C was used (compared to the results of Protocol A and B, i.e., regardless of whether the RDCs were used or not), and as the RDCs used in Protocol B did not change the overall fold of the protein, we decided to use structures calculated using Protocol C as final structures, at the price of not including the RDCs in the final refinement.

DISCUSSION
The obtained structures contain six well-defined helices, labeled as A (L10-L14), B (K17-V27), C (P35-E49), D (E57-K72), E (L75-F85), and F (R92K100) in this report (Fig. 4). The helices are arranged into a shape of a prism. Two walls of the prism are formed by V-shaped motifs consisting of pairs of helices A-B and D-E. The third wall is closed by helix C, which is perpendicular to the helices of the V-shaped motifs. Helix F is packed

against the face formed by helices D and E. All helices are amphiphilic, with the hydrophobic sides formed mostly by leucines and isoleucines. Helices A, B, D, and E form an internal prism-like cavity closed at the top by helix C. This cavity is delimited by the hydrophobic sides of these helices, and therefore well-suited to constitute a binding site for hydrophobic ligands. The observed fold of CSP1 of B. mori is similar to that of related chemosensory proteins CSPMbraA6 of M. brassicae (Lartigue et al., 2002; Campanacci et al., 2003) and CSPsg4 of S. gregaria (Tomaselli et al., 2006). Figure 5 shows the comparison of BmorCSP1 to CSPMbraA6 and CSPsg4. Interestingly, the N-terminal helix A starts only at Q 11 of our construct (corresponding to residue 14 of the native protein), similarly to CSPsg4 (Tomaselli et al., 2006) and to the ligand-bound CSPMbraA6 (Campanacci et al., 2003), but in contrast to the long helix A observed in one of two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal of the apo form of CSPMbraA6 (Lartigue et al., 2002). Helix E has the same length as in the NMR structure of CSPsg4 and X-ray structure of CSPMbraA6, being longer than the corresponding helix in the solution structure of CSPMbraA6

(Mosbah et al., 2003). Helix F is somewhat shorter than helix F of CSPMbraA6 (Lartigue et al., 2002; Mosbah et al., 2003), but longer than helix F of CSPsg4. Also, the orientation of the helices somewhat differs among the structures. No ligand binding data are currently available for BmorCSP1. Different CSPs have been reported to bind moth (Jacquin-Joly et al., 2001) and honeybee (Briand et al., 2002) pheromones. Fatty acids and other long-chain hydrocarbon derivatives were reported to bind to CPSs of honeybee A. mellifera (Briand et al., 2002), cabbage moth M. brassicae (Lartigue et al., 2002), wasp P. dominulus (Calvello et al., 2003), and locust L. migratoria (Ban et al., 2002, 2003). Cuticular hydrocarbons were identified as CSP ligands of the carpenter ant Camponotus japonicus (Ozaki et al., 2005). Structural data are available for free and ligand-bound MbraCSP6 of M. brassicae. In MbraCSPA6, the ligand binding pocket consists of a 14-Å-long hydrophobic tunnel running through the protein between the two V-shaped structures. This channel is able to accommodate three molecules of a ligand, the 12-bromododecanol (Lartigue et al., 2002; Campanacci et al., 2003). It should be emphasized that the large binding cavity is formed only in the presence of the ligand. The alignment of the two structures of MbraCSPA6 and BmorCSP1 (Fig. 5) shows that both proteins can form a binding pocket between the V-shaped motifs and helix C, and thus bind structurally similar ligands. The internal cavities, identified by program PASS (Brady and Stouten, 2000), are found in somewhat different positions, reflecting the different orientation of helices A and B in BmorCSP1 and CSPMbraA6 (see Fig. 5A and C). However, the differences between free forms of BmorCSP1 and CSPMbraA6 are insignificant when compared to the extensive conformational changes that occur upon binding three ligand molecules in CSPMbraA6, resulting in a formation of a large cavity occupied by the ligands (Fig. 5C). Considering structural similarity of free BmorCSP1 and CSPMbraA6, large structural changes may also occur upon ligand binding to BmorCSP1. Such conformational changes are difficult to predict and make attempts to define the

putative binding cavity unreliable, as the chemical structure and number of ligand molecules bound to a single BmorCSP1 molecule are not known in advance. Therefore, we do not present a structural model of ligand-bound BmorCSP1 in this study.
