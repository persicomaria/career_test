We have determined the crystal structure of a-pokeweed antiviral protein, a member of ribosome-inactivating proteins, at 0.23 nm resolution, by the molecular-replacement method. The crystals belong to the space group P2,2,2 with unit-cell dimensions a = 4.71, b = 11.63 and c = 4.96 nm, and contain one protein molecule/asymmetric unit based on a crystal volume/unit protein molecular mass of 2.1 X 10-3nm3/Da. The crystallographic residual value was reduced to 17.2% (0.6-0.23 nm resolution) with root-mean-square deviations in bond lengths of 1.9 pm and bond angles of 2.2". The Ca-Ca distance map shows that a-pokeweed antiviral protein is composed of three modules, the N-terminal (Alal -Leu76), the central (Tyr77-Lys185) and the C-terminal (Tyrl86-Thr266) modules. The substrate-binding site is formed as a cleft between the central and C-terminal modules and all the active residues exist on the central module. The electrostatic potential around the substrate-binding site shows that the central and C-terminal module sides of this cleft have a negatively and a positively charged region, respectively. This charge distribution in the protein seems to provide a suitable interaction with the substrate rRNA.

Three isozymes of pokeweed antiviral protein [l -31 have been isolated from Phytolacca americana ; pokeweed antiviral protein from spring leaves (PAP), pokeweed antiviral protein-2 from summer leaves (PAP-2) and pokeweed antiviral protein-S from seeds (PAP-S). Recently, a-pokeweed antiviral protein (a-PAP), encoded by a type-a genomic clone [4] which had been cloned based on the amino acid sequence of PAP-S, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli (266 amino acid residues found to be 77% and 74% identical to amino acid sequences of PAP-S and PAP, respectively [4]). These PAPS belong to a family of plant ribosome-inactivating proteins which includes ricin from Ricinus communis [ 5 ] , trichosanthin from Trichosanthis kirilowii Maxim [6], and Mirabilis antiviral protein from Mirabilis jalapa [7]. These ribosome-inactivating proteins are also homologous to a family of bacterial toxins which includes the A chain of Shiga toxin from Shigella disentaria, and a Shiga-like toxin from

E. coli [8]. These are RNA N-glycosidases that release adenine from a specific adenosine residue of rRNA [9, 101. aPAP also cleaves the N-glycoside bond at adenine4324 of rat liver 28s rRNA [4], the structure around which adenine has a double helical stem and a 17-base loop with a nucleotide sequence of GA4324GA [ ll] . Ribosome-inactivating proteins are proposed to exert their RNA N-glycosidase activity in three processes, i.e. identification of a substrate rRNA, binding to the substrate and hydrolysis of a specific N-glycoside bond. In the hydrolysis process, the active residues of the ricin A chain are proposed to work on the rRNA[12] as follows; both Tyr80 and Tyr123 sandwich the adenine ring with an energetically favorable stacking conformation, Argl80 stabilizes an anion charge on the adenine through protonation, and Glu177 stabilizes a cation charge on the ribose in the transition state. In the identification and binding of a substrate, for example of a polarized molecule such as rRNA, a charge interaction between the protein and the substrate might play a major role. In light of this, the charge distribution of the protein shown by the electrostatic potential is thought to have a unique ability to stabilize the charge of the substrate. It is believed that several proteins, considered as modules combined to form a new protein in the course of evolution; a newly formed interface between the proteins would work as an active site for a new activity[l3]. If a-PAP acquired its rRNA N-glycosidase activity through the combination of modules in the course of evolution, a postulated module structure would have characteristic electrostatic features and

a characteristic location of active residues thought to be essential to exhibit activity. Thus, we determined the three-dimensional structure of a-PAP at 0.23-nm resolution and discussed it based on its module structure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
a-PAP was prepared as described previously [14]. Crystal ScreenTM [15, 161 was used for initial screening of crystallization conditions as an incomplete factorial approach [17]. The hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method, where a drop containing equal volumes of the protein (8 mg/ml) and a precipitant was equilibrated against 0.7 ml precipitant in a reservoir, was used. The best crystals (0.8X0.8X0.5 mm) grew in two months at room temperature in 0.2 M sodium citrate, pH 6.5, using 21% (masshol.) poly(ethy1ene glycol) 4000 as a precipitant. The crystals belong to the space group P2,2,2 with unit-cell dimensions of n = 4.71 nm, b = 11.63 nm and c = 4.96 nm, and contain one a-PAP molecule/asymmetric unit based on a crystal volumehnit protein molecular mass of 2.1 X 10-'nm3/Da 1181. Three sets of intensity data were collected using the three crystals on a Xuong-Hamlin multiwire area detector system [191 and a MacScience MXCl8 rotating-anode X-ray generator operating at 40 kV/100 mA with graphite monochromated CuKa radiation. Each data set was processed using the UCSD cloned data processing program [20] and were merged with each other using the Protein [21]. A total of 21034 reflections were measured, resulting in 13 157 reflections unique to 0.23-nm d spacing. The completeness of the data set was 98.9%. The overall merging R value

from Protein Data Bank [23, 241 (registration code 1PAF). To determine the position of the PAP molecule in the unit cell of a-PAP, the automatic processing program system Automr [25] on an IBM RS-6000/550 was applied. The minimum crystallographic residual value ( R value) of the molecular-replacement model was 44.6%, significantly lower than those of other solutions. The molecular replacement model was refined by the X-Plor [26] (0.60-0.23 nm). In the first refinement, the R value was reduced to 19.3%. After this refinement, 121FJ - IFJ, aca,c and I IFJ - IFc[, acalc I I electron density maps were calculated and amino acid residues of PAP were substituted for those of a-PAP using the Frodo [27] on an Evans and Sutherland PS39ONAX8530. Five further cycles of refinement and rebuilding were performed. In these cycles, 95 water molecules were included in the model, but the first five residues (Alal-Pro-Thr-LeuGlu5) used as a linker peptide for overexpression in E. coli [14] were not included in the model because their electron densities were insufficient, while the N-terminal sequence of the crystallized sample was found to be identical to the linker peptide. The final R value for data at 0.60-0.23 nm (IFol > 30) was 17.2% with root-mean-square deviations in bond lengths of 1.9 pm and bond angles of 2.2'. The overall coordinate error in the atomic positions was estimated according to the Luzzati plot [28], from which the root-meansquare error in the atomic coordinates were estimated to be under 0.025 nm. The atomic coordinates and structure-factor amplitudes have been submitted to the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (registration code 1APA).

overall dimensions of 5.8X4.3X4.0 nm. It has eight a helices (A-H), a six-stranded p sheet (a-f), a two-stranded /3 sheet (g and h) and two disulfide bonds (Cys39-Cys263 and Cys89-Cyslll). Seven a helices, all except for helix B, are sandwiched between the two p sheets. Helix B is attached to the six-stranded p sheet on the solvent surface. The overall structure of a-PAP is similar to that of PAP except that four N-terminal amino acid residues (Ile6-Asn-Thr-Ile) extend in a different direction (Fig. 1). The root-mean-square deviation of the corresponding Ca atoms between a-PAP and PAP is 0.09 nm. The Ca-Ca distance map [29] of a-PAP, where pairs of Ca carbons separated by >2.7 nm [30] are contoured, is shown in Fig. 3. This map shows that a-PAP can be divided into three very compact modules ; the N-terminal module (Alal -Leu76), the central module (Tyr77-Lysl85) and the C-terminal module (Tyrl86 -Thr266), although some alternative modules with slightly different boundaries could be postulated. The joint between the N-terminal and central modules is at the head of strand d and the other joint between the central and C-terminal modules is at the head of helix F. Ribosome-inactivating proteins have four highly conserved residues that are thought to be active residues relating to N-glycosidase activity. The active residues of a-PAP were found to be Tyr77, Tyr128, Glu180 and Arg183 based on the structural comparison of a-PAP and a complex of ricin A chain and formycin monophosphate [12] from Protein Data Bank (registration code 1FMP). As shown in Figs 1 and 4,

in a-PAP these residues are located in the central module, three of which exist near the outer edges and the other which exists at the center of the sequence of the central module. The distance maps of the ribosome-inactivating proteins for which atomic coordinates are available (i.e. rich A chain and PAP) show that these proteins also have a three-module structure and that the corresponding four active residues are also located in the central module. Therefore, the cleavage of the N-glycoside bond is carried out by the central module and the central module presented is thought to be a functional unit. Until now, it has been believed that the module structure of a protein reflects the structure of a genomic gene, and that one module is often derived from one exon which is separated by introns, as is the case for hemoglobin [13, 301. Furthermore, the exon-intron structure in a genomic gene has been proposed to be closely related to the evolution of a protein [32]. One intron has been found in the genomic gene of Mirubilis antiviral protein [33] and is located between residues Lys178 and Ile179 in the amino acid sequence of Mirubilis antiviral protein. In a-PAP, the corresponding position is between residues Phe184 and Lys185, and is close to the joint between the central and C-terminal modules (Fig. 4). Although the genomic gene of a-PAP has been found to be constructed with only one exon [4] and does not seem to be related to the module structure, we can speculate that two introns might exist in the ancestral a-PAP gene, and might have been deleted during evolution.

Charge distribution of the active site An electrostatic potential around an active site, as well as the overall shape of the active site is important for binding a large charged molecule, such as rRNA, to the active site. The electrostatic potential of a-PAP, calculated by Quanta Ver3.3 [34], shows suitable features for binding to the substrate rRNA. As shown in Fig. 5 , a-PAP has an active site which is formed by a cleft at the interface between the central and C-terminal modules. At the bottom of the active site there is a pocket that includes the four active residues. In PAP and ricin A chain, the substrate analog formycin is reported to sit in the active pocket in such a way that the formycin ring and ribose moieties face to the central and the Cterminal modules, respectively, and the phosphate group is located on the upper right side of the active pocket [12, 221. Rat liver rRNA substrate has a structure that surrounds adenosine4324 with a double-helical stem and a 17-base loop with a ribonucleoside sequence of GAGA [9- 111. Therefore, the phosphate group of guanosine432.5 is thought to be placed in a location opposite to that of adenosine4324, meaning that it could exist on the upper left side of the active pocket when the substrate-binds to the protein. In a-PAP, the region where the negatively charged phosphate group of guanosine4325 would interact is most positively charged (violet) due to the existence of $JNof Lys257. Therefore, charge interaction between the protein and the substrate seems to stabilize binding when the specific partial structure of the substrate and the active site of the protein bind to each other, as has been found in the ricin A chain and formycin complex. In amino acid sequence alignment of ricin A chain, abrin A chain, trichosanthin, Mirabilis antiviral protein and saporin

6, the corresponding amino acid residue is shown to be a neutral or a basic amino acid residue, Val, Leu or Lys [34]. In PAP and PAP-S, it is a neutral amino acid residue, Asn (Fig. 4). An acidic amino acid residue which supplies a negative charge, unfavorable for binding, never appears at this position. In addition, the charge distributions on the surfaces of the protein and the substrate seem to provide a suitable interaction. As shown in Fig. 5, the active site of a-PAP has a positively charged band (violet and blue) around the C-terminal module side, due to the presence of Lys72, Lys214, Lys234, Lys240 and Lys257, and a negatively charged region (red and yellow) around the central module side caused by the presence of Asp96, Glu102, Asp125, Glu132, Glu180 and Glu210. Although a structure of the 17-base loop of rRNA suitable for calculating the electrostatic potential has not yet been proposed, the structures of several RNA tetra loops have been determined [35]. The proposed tetra loop structures indicate that the phosphate groups and the base groups of the all ribonucleotides except the attacked adenine ring, are located on the outside and the inside of the loop, respectively. These structures indicate that a negative charge is distributed on the bowed surface of the loop along its main chain and a positive charge exists on both sides of the plane defined by the loop. It is reported that ricin A chain catalyzes both the tetra and 17-base loops [36], therefore the electrostatic potential features of the sections of these loops where ricin A chain interacts should be similar to each other. If this is the case concerning the interaction between a-PAP and the 17-base loop of rRNA, the positively charged band around

Most positively and negatively charged regions are shown in violet and red, respectively. The N-terminal, the central and the C-terminal modules are drawn in blue, yellow and red solid lines, respectively.

the C-terminal module and the negatively charged region around the central module may have some role in the determination of the rotational orientation of a-PAP and the loop, in addition to stabilization of the binding. When the active site and the substrate approach each other with proper orientation, Coulombic force induced by their charges could work as an attractive force, producing a more favorable approach

and, in the case of improper orientation, it would work as a repulsive force, resulting in an unfavorable approach.
