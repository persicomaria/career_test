Churchill, a Zinc Finger Transcriptional Activator, Regulates the Transition between Gastrulation and Neurulation
Guojun Sheng, Mario dos Reis, and Claudio D. Stern* Department of Anatomy and Developmental Biology University College London Gower Street London WC1E 6BT United Kingdom within 2 hr, but unless cells are exposed to other (unknown) signals, this expression is lost and cells revert to an epidermal fate. We have also found that 5 hr exposure to either organizer-derived (Hensen's node) signals or to FGF8 are required to sensitize cells to BMP antagonists, which then stabilize the expression of Sox3 (Streit et al., 1998). It therefore became important to define the differences between cells that have or have not been exposed to an organizer for 5 hr. To achieve this, we designed a differential screen to identify genes whose expression is regulated after 5 hr exposure to the organizer. Here, we report the isolation and functions of one of these genes, Churchill (ChCh). This encodes a zinc finger protein that acts as a transcriptional activator, yet it represses the induction of mesoderm (Brachyury and Tbx6L) by FGF, suggesting that at least one of its targets is a transcriptional repressor. We identify one putative target, Smad-interactingprotein-1 (Sip1) and show that ChCh is required for normal expression of Sip1 as well as for neural plate development. ChCh also sensitizes cells to neural-inducing signals from the organizer and regulates the cell movements of mesoderm formation. Together with the expression patterns of these components, these results suggest that ChCh functions as an important switch between gastrulation (mesoderm/endoderm formation) and neurulation. It also appears to act as a gate separating two different functions of FGF signaling: in mesendoderm formation and in neural induction. Finally, this provides a simple explanation for why cells exposed to FGF for 5 hr become sensitive to BMP signaling. Results Churchill: a Zinc Finger Gene Expressed in the Developing Nervous System Chick epiblast cells that are not destined to form neural plate require a minimum of 5 hr exposure to the organizer (Hensen's node) before they become responsive to BMP antagonists (Streit et al., 1998). To uncover the events that take place during these 5 hr, we performed a differential screen between cells that have or have not been exposed to a node graft for 5 hr (Streit et al., 2000). One of the genes isolated encodes a 112 aa protein, containing two putative C4-type zinc fingers. Within each finger, the spacing between the two CXXC motifs (23 aa and 24 aa for the N- and C-terminal fingers, respectively) is different from that of other known C4-type zinc finger proteins (Teakle and Gilmartin, 1998). We named it Churchill (ChCh; Figure 1A), by analogy to Sir Winston's famous gesture. Northern analysis of RNA from chick embryos from stage 4 (primitive streak) to stage 13 (2 day) shows a single transcript of the predicted size (Figure 1C). Database searches reveal clear homologs in human, rat (and other mammalian species), and Fugu but none of these has been studied to date. Using a combination of cDNA library screening and degenerate PCR, we obtained full-length sequences from mouse, Xenopus, and zebrafish. Sequence comparisons

Summary Gastrulation generates mesoderm and endoderm from embryonic epiblast; soon after, the neural plate is established within the epiblast--both events require FGF signaling. We describe a zinc finger transcriptional activator, Churchill (ChCh), which acts as a switch between different roles of FGF. FGF induces ChCh slowly; this activates Smad-interacting-protein-1 (Sip1), which blocks further induction of the mesoderm markers brachyury and Tbx6L by FGF. ChCh is first expressed as cells stop migrating through the primitive streak, and we show that it regulates cell ingression. We propose a simple mechanism by which FGF sensitizes cells to BMP signals. These results reveal that neural induction requires cessation of mesoderm formation at the midline in addition to the decision between epidermis and neural plate. Introduction During gastrulation, the early embryo establishes three cell layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) by coordinating multiple signaling events with complex cell movements. Then, the ectoderm becomes subdivided into neural and nonneural (mainly epidermis) subregions. A large body of work has revealed that these complex processes are controlled by just a handful of signaling factors, and that the molecular pathways are conserved throughout the Animal kingdom. Among the most important signals are the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which are required for mesoderm formation (Kimelman and Kirschner, 1987; Paterno and Gillespie, 1989; Amaya et al., 1991; Christian et al., 1992; Cornell and Kimmelman, 1994) and migration (Sun et al., 1999; Ciruna and Rossant, 2001; Yang et al., 2002), for neural induction (Launay et al., 1996; Sasai et al., 1996; Streit et al., 2000; Wilson et al., 2000) and for caudalization of the neural plate (Cox and Hemmati-Brivanlou, 1995; Holowacz and Sokol, 1999; Domingos et al., 2001). These processes occur in the ectoderm, very close to each other in time and space: how do the receiving cells decide on the appropriate response? Previous studies have revealed that FGF signaling is required, but not sufficient for neural induction (Streit et al., 2000; Wilson et al., 2000). FGF8 induces the expression of the early preneural genes Sox3 and ERNI

(J and K) A graft of quail Hensen's node induces ChCh expression in the area opaca of a chick host. Quail cells (QCPN staining) are shown in brown, ChCh RNA in purple. K is a section through the grafted region, showing expression in the chick epiblast overlying the graft. (L) FGF8b-soaked beads induce ChCh expression in the area opaca. This embryo received a graft on each side.

(Figures 1A and 1B) show that the unusual 23­24 aa spacing within the zinc fingers is conserved among all of these; each species appears to have only one gene with these characteristics. Although the differential screen was performed in the extraembryonic area opaca, any genes involved in neural induction must be expressed in the prospective neural plate of the normal embryo. Consistent with this, in situ hybridization (Figures 1D­1I) reveals that ChCh is expressed specifically in the entire prospective neural plate starting at stage 4 (Figure 1D); it continues to be expressed in the neural plate throughout its formation (Figures 1E­1H) until at least stages 11­13 (data not shown). Churchill Expression Is Regulated by FGF Some genes (ERNI, Sox3) are induced very quickly (1­2 hr) in response to a graft of the node (Streit et al., 2000), while others require a longer time (9 hr for Sox2). To place ChCh within the cascade, we grafted a quail Hensen's node into the area opaca of a stage 3 chick host and assayed for ChCh induction in time course: 4 hr contact are required (2 hr: 0/4; 3 hr: 1/11; 4 hr: 6/6;

5 hr: 19/20; Figures 1J and 1K). Node grafts into stage 5 and older hosts which have lost competence for neural induction (Streit et al., 1997) do not induce ChCh (0/7). Induction of ERNI and Sox3 by a grafted node requires FGF signaling, and FGF4 or FGF8 alone will induce their expression (Streit et al., 2000). We therefore tested whether these FGFs can also induce ChCh. Heparin beads soaked in FGF4 (28/28) or FGF8b (20/23; Figure 1L) induce ChCh with the same time course as a node. By contrast, neither control beads (0/4), Chordin (0/12), Noggin (0/18), HGF/SF (0/16), nor Cerberus (0/6) induces ChCh. Moreover, FGF8 induces ChCh even in the presence of BMP4 (7/8), indicating that this induction is insensitive to BMP signaling. These results show that the expression of Churchill, a gene encoding a zinc finger protein, is regulated within 4­5 hr in response to signals from the organizer and by FGF in a BMP-independent way. Churchill Represses Mesoderm Markers, but Is a Transcriptional Activator To determine the intracellular site of action of ChCh, we injected myc-tagged ChCh mRNA into Xenopus em-

The chick embryo is shown in whole mount (C) and two sections through the electroporated region (D and E). (F­J) ChCh inhibits induction of Brachyury by eFGF in Xenopus. (F) shows the results of an animal cap assay. The animal pole was injected with water (H2O), ChCh, ChChVP16, or ChChEnR RNA. At the blastula stage, the animal cap was excised and treated with eFGF. Expression of Brachyury (XBra) and EF1 as a loading control were examined by RT-PCR. (G­H) show the effects of misexpressing ChCh by injection of RNA into the region fated to express XBra.

bryos. At or before stage 8 (Figure 2A), staining is detected in the cytoplasm; however, the protein becomes strongly concentrated in the nucleus at stage 81/2 after midblastula transition (Figure 2B). Likewise, chick embryos electroporated with a tagged expression construct reveal nuclear localization in the epiblast at stage 6 (Figures 2C­2E). Since the predicted protein sequence does not include a nuclear localization signal, and since the protein does not localize to the nucleus until midto-late blastula, it is likely that ChCh is carried to the nucleus by another protein that appears at this time. What is the function of ChCh? As an initial approach, we injected ChCh mRNA into 2­4 cell stage Xenopus embryos and grew them to neurula stage. The gross appearance of these embryos (data not shown) was very similar to the phenotype of embryos injected with a dominant-negative FGF receptor, having severe body curvature and axial truncations (Amaya et al., 1991). This suggested that ChCh may inhibit FGF signaling. To test this more directly, we examined the effect of ChCh misexpression on the induction of the mesoderm marker Brachyury (XBra), an "immediate-early" target of FGF signaling in Xenopus (Smith et al., 1991), in animal cap assays. Indeed, ChCh RNA injection represses the induction of XBra by eFGF (Figure 2F). To determine whether ChCh is a transcriptional activator or a repressor, we fused ChCh to the VP16-activator or the engrailed-repressor (EnR) domains. In animal cap assays, the VP16-activator construct also represses XBra induction by eFGF, while the EnR construct does not (Figure 2F). Likewise, when injected into the pre-

sumptive marginal zone (the future XBra expressing region), ChCh (23/34 68%; Figure 2H) and ChCh-VP16 (42/45 95%; Figure 2I) but not control injections (0/36) or ChCh-EnR (0/29; Figure 2J), inhibit XBra expression in intact embryos. Similar results were obtained by electroporation of ChCh in the chick: ChCh and ChChVP16 repress both cBra (Figures 2K­2O) and the related mesodermal gene, Tbx6L (Knezevic et al., 1997) (for Brachyury: ChCh-5/10 50%; ChChVP16-17/21 81%; ChChEnR0/5; control GFP-2/17 12%; for Tbx6L: ChChVP164/7 57%; GFP-0/8). Analysis of several other markers in the electroporated cells revealed no change in the expression of neural (Sox2, Sox3) epidermal (GATA2, GATA3, E-cadherin) or neural plate border (Msx1) markers apart from downregulation of cBra and Tbx6L. In all of these experiments, the VP16 construct had a stronger effect than the wild-type protein, again suggesting that ChCh may normally act with a cofactor. These results suggest that Churchill may be a DNA binding protein. Using an in vitro DNA binding selection assay, we determined the optimal binding sequences for ChCh protein from a pool of random oligonucleotides flanked by constant sequences. Comparison of the selected sequences yielded an optimal binding site of CGGG(GAT(GAC) (Figure 3A). This consensus is similar, but not identical to binding sites reported for other zinc finger proteins. To test this, we performed gel mobility shift and competition experiments, which confirmed that ChCh can bind specifically to this sequence (Figures 3B and 3C). Thus, although ChCh can repress the mesoderm markers Bra and Tbx6L, the above results suggest

XBra (Verschueren et al., 1999; Lerchner et al., 2000; Papin et al., 2002). We therefore cloned a fragment (encoding amino acids 582­936) of chick Sip1 (Figure 4). Its expression pattern is indistinguishable from that of ChCh (compare Figures 1D­1I with Figures 5A­5G). We examined putative regulatory regions of human and mouse Sip1 to see if they contain target sequences for ChCh. Thirteen such sequences, highly conserved between the two species, are found tightly clustered in a putative 480 bp enhancer immediately upstream of the translation initiation codon of Sip1. More extensive analysis of a 4 Kb region including exons 1 and 2 revealed that the number (120) of ChCh sites found in this region is statistically nonrandom (Monte Carlo analysis, log-L ratio 478.72, P 0.001; see Supplemental Data available at http://www.cell.com/cgi/content/full/115/5/ 603/DC1). As a more direct test that Sip1 is a target of Churchill, we electroporated a fluorescein-labeled morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) against chick ChCh into the future rostral neural plate of stage 4 chick embryos. By stages 7­9, not only was Sip1 expression absent (Figures 5J, 5K, 5N, 5O, and 5Q), but the neural plate had either not formed (Figures 5N and 5O) or was greatly diminished in thickness (Figure 5R) in the electroporated region (9/15 60% with this result), consistent with the effects of gain and loss of XSip1 in Xenopus (Eisaki et al., 2000; Papin et al., 2002). By contrast, electroporation of either a MO against a related sequence (11 bp changes) or of an unrelated "standard control" (Gene Tools) (0/10 and 0/16 respectively; Figures 5H, 5I, 5L, 5M, and 5P) had no effect on Sip1 expression or neural development. As additional controls, we tested the specificity of the MOs by their ability to knock down translation of chick ChCh protein. Tagged cChCh mRNA was coinjected into Xenopus embryos, either together with the chick ChCh MO or with the closely related MO. Staining for the tagged protein revealed that the chick ChCh MO specifically reduced translation of chick ChCh protein, while the related MO did not (Supplemental Figure S1 available on Cell website). In conclusion, Sip1 is a likely target of ChCh, which can account for the finding that ChCh represses Brachyury.

that it may function as a transcriptional activator, raising the possibility that other genes are upregulated in response to ChCh action (e.g., via CGGGRR DNA motifs) that can block Bra and Tbx6L expression. Evidence for Smad-Interacting Protein (Sip1) as a Target of Churchill The consequences of ChCh misexpression are very similar to the phenotype of Xenopus embryos injected with Smad-interacting-protein-1 (Sip1; also known as ZEB-2 and ZFHX1B)-- a direct transcriptional repressor of

Churchill Regulates Cell Ingression through the Primitive Streak Brachyury is an important regulator of mesoderm formation during gastrulation (Wilson et al., 1995; Wilson and Beddington, 1997; Tada and Smith, 2000). We therefore investigated whether ChCh affects gastrulation movements through the primitive streak. Cells in the epiblast near the primitive streak (stage 3­3 ) were electroporated with ChCh-IRES-GFP, ChChVP16-IRES-GFP, or control constructs IRES-GFP or ChChMutVP-IRES-GFP (containing mutated zinc fingers), and cell movements followed in time lapse (Figures 6A­6D and Supplemental Movies S1 and S2 available on Cell website). Cells expressing either of the two control constructs moved to the primitive streak, ingressed through it, and emerged migrating anterolaterally in the mesoderm underneath (Figure 6A). By contrast, cells expressing ChCh (Figure 6B) or ChChVP16 (Figure 6C) moved normally toward the primitive streak, but failed to ingress and to move

away from the streak to form mesoderm (see Supplemental Movies [control and Churchill] available on Cell website). This suggests that ChCh functions to control mesoderm formation at the primitive streak by regulating

cell movements. The onset of normal expression of ChCh at the end of stage 4 is consistent with this role, since ingression of epiblast through the anterior parts of the streak to form mesoderm and endoderm ends

Time lapse sequences showing the movements of cells electroporated with IRES-GFP (control, A), ChChIRES-GFP (B), and ChChVP16-IRES-GFP (C). In (A), cells move normally toward and out (white arrows) of the primitive streak to form mesoderm. In (B) and (C) cells, converge to the streak but become trapped within it and do not emerge as mesoderm. (D­S) Downregulation of ChCh promotes cell ingression. Cells electroporated at stage 4 with a control-MO (D at t 0, green) do not ingress and contribute only to neural plate (E, H, I; blue). Cells with ChCh-MO (F at t 0, green) ingress through the streak and contribute to mesoderm (G, J, K; blue, arrows). This effect can be rescued by coelectroporation of Xenopus ChCh (L, M, P, and Q) or of Xenopus Sip1 (N, O, R, and S). In (P­S), note that the blue cells (which received MO alone) still migrate into mesoderm (arrows) while cells that received the rescuing construct (brown) remain in the epiblast, where they integrate normally into the neural tube (P and inset). (T­W) A quail node graft into the area opaca at stage 5 does not induce the neural marker Sox2 (T and U) unless the epiblast (arrows) has previously been electroporated with ChCh (V and W).

soon afterward (Nicolet, 1965, 1970; Rosenquist, 1966, 1971, 1972; Gallera, 1975; Garcia-Martinez et al., 1993; Hatada and Stern, 1994; Psychoyos and Stern, 1996; Joubin and Stern, 1999). To test this hypothesis, we electroporated fluorescein-labeled control or ChCh morpholinos lateral to the anterior streak at stage 4 (when these cells should no longer ingress) and followed their movements. Cells with control-MO remained in the epiblast, underwent convergent extension, and contributed exclusively to neural plate (n 5; Figures 6D, 6E, 6H, and 6I), while large numbers of cells with ChCh-MO ingressed through the streak and gave rise to paraxial mesoderm (n 7; Figures 6F, 6G, 6J, and 6K). To test the specificity of the

morpholino, we coelectroporated Xenopus ChCh together with the cChCh-MO; this leads to a mosaic of cells receiving XChCh, cChCh-MO, or both. Cells that only received cChCh-MO enter the mesoderm as in the MO experiment (blue in Figures 6L, 6M, 6P, and 6Q) while cells receiving XChCh or both (brown in Figures 6L, 6M, 6P, and 6Q) remain in the epiblast and give rise to neural plate. Likewise, coelectroporation of Xenopus Sip1 with cChCh-MO rescues the phenotype of the morpholino (Figures 6N, 6O, 6R, and 6S). In both cases, the rescued cells not only remain in the epiblast but also participate normally in neural tube formation (e.g., Figure 6P and inset). Furthermore, Sip1 is sufficient to overcome the thinning of the neural plate that results from

Churchill in Gastrulation and Neural Induction 609

loss of ChCh function (cf. Figures 5R and 6S). These results show that ChCh function is required to stop gastrulation movements through the anterior primitive streak. Since Sip1 is sufficient to rescue the effects of ChCh loss of function, Sip1 is likely to be the major effector of ChCh in controlling cell movements through the primitive streak. Churchill Regulates Competence to Neural-Inducing Signals Epiblast cells surrounding Hensen's node and the anterior part of the primitive streak that escape ingression through the streak and remain on the surface of the embryo eventually contribute to the nervous system. Could ChCh play a role in sensitizing these cells to neural-inducing signals emanating from the node? Since the nonneural epiblast loses competence to respond to neural-inducing signals from the node between stages 4 and 4 (Gallera and Ivanov, 1964; Dias and Schoenwolf, 1990; Storey et al., 1992), sensitization can be tested by assessing whether ChCh can maintain the responsiveness of epiblast to node signals beyond stage 4 . We therefore electroporated ChCh-IRES-GFP into one side of the epiblast of the area opaca at stage 4, incubated the embryo to stage 5 and grafted a quail node in contact with the electroporated cells. As a control, a second node was transplanted into the contralateral side. In 6/9 cases, the grafted node induced the neural marker Sox2 in the host chick epiblast on the electroporated side (Figures 6V and 6W) but not on the control side (0/9) (Figures 6T and 6U). This suggests that ChCh can maintain the competence of the epiblast to respond to neural-inducing signals from the node. Discussion Gastrulation involves multiple processes: establishment of the germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm), orchestration of cell movements and ingression of the epiblast to form mesoderm and endoderm, and subdivision of the ectoderm into future epidermal and neural subdomains. Our results implicate Churchill in all of these processes (Figure 7). Churchill Separates Different Functions of FGF Signaling FGFs have multiple functions during the early stages of vertebrate development (see Introduction). These functions are incompatible with one another, yet occur very close to each other in time and space. How do the receiving cells decide how to respond? Our findings suggest a mechanism that can switch between mesoderm- and neural-inducing activities of FGF (Figure 7). Ectoderm cells exposed to FGF (perhaps in conjunction with Nodal and/or Wnt; (Bertocchini and Stern, 2002) turn on the mesodermal markers Brachyury and Tbx6L, and ingress through the primitive streak to generate mesendoderm. After 4 hr exposure to FGF, however, Churchill is induced; this in turn induces Sip1 which blocks further induction of Brachyury and Tbx6L by FGF, as well as cell ingression through the primitive streak and thus mesendoderm formation. Cells remaining in the epiblast which express Churchill can now be exposed

to further signals from the organizer; these signals will stabilize the "preneural" state established in the epiblast by earlier exposure to FGF (Stern, 2001), by maintaining or enhancing the competence of the responding epiblast to other neural-inducing signals emanating from the node. This mechanism would effectively separate the processes of gastrulation and neurulation, both of which require FGF but which are mutually incompatible. Role of Churchill in Mesoderm Formation A significant feature of the expression pattern of ChCh (and of Sip1) in the chick is that transcripts first appear in the epiblast adjoining the anterior primitive streak at the same stage as ingression of the epiblast to form mesendoderm ceases. Churchill misexpression does not prevent convergence of epiblast cells toward the primitive streak, but it does block the emergence of mesendoderm from it. Conversely, knockdown of ChCh after the end of gastrulation causes cells to continue to ingress. The former effect resembles those of Sip1 misexpression in the frog (Verschueren et al., 1999; Papin et al., 2002), and the phenotype of mice mutant for brachyury (Wilson et al., 1995), Tbx6 (Chapman and Papaioannou, 1998), FGF8 (Sun et al., 1999), or FGF receptor-1 (Ciruna et al., 1997). The roles of FGF8 in gastrular ingression have recently been ascribed to chemorepulsion for the emerging mesoderm (Yang et al., 2002). However, the FGF targets Brachyury and Tbx6 are also essential for cell movements through the primitive streak (Wilson et al., 1995; Chapman et al., 1996; Wilson and Beddington, 1997; Chapman and Papaioannou, 1998; Ciruna and Rossant, 2001), even though they are unlikely to be involved in repulsion, and FGF4, which does not act as a repellant (Yang et al., 2002), induces ChCh just as well as does FGF8. It was recently shown (Postigo, 2003; Postigo et al., 2003) that Sip1 binds to the activated forms of both Smad1/5 (BMP targets) and Smad2/3 (TGF /activin/ nodal targets) and that it inhibits activin-dependent Brachyury expression and thus mesoderm formation, which requires activin/nodal-related signals in cooperation with FGFs (Kimelman et al., 1992; LaBonne and Whitman, 1994; Cornell et al., 1995). Churchill/Sip1 could therefore act in three separate ways in mesendoderm formation: changing the responses of cells to BMP signaling, blocking mesendoderm induction by TGF- / activin/nodal FGF, and ending ingression movements through the primitive streak. Roles of Churchill in Neural Induction Node grafts induce the early neural markers ERNI, Sox3, and Otx2 in 1­2 hr in the area opaca, but if the graft is removed before about 13 hr, this expression is lost and the cells revert to a nonneural fate (Gallera, 1971). Inhibition of BMP by Chordin after 5 hr exposure to a node will stabilize the expression of Sox3 (Streit et al., 1998). The differential screen that identified Churchill was designed to understand why 5 hr signaling from the organizer is required for cells to become sensitive to BMP (Streit et al., 2000). The conclusion that Sip1 is a target of Churchill provides an attractive explanation for the initial observation. Sip1 was identified in a screen designed to find partners of Smad1, a protein required for

Figure 7. Model Summarizing the Regulation and Functions of ChCh during Early Development (A­D): the embryologist's view; (E): the geneticist's view. In (A­D), embryos are shown at four stages, with their germ layers exploded. (A) At stages XI­XII, the hypoblast (brown) emits FGF8, which induces the early preneural genes ERNI and Sox3 (orange) in the overlying epiblast (yellow), but the cells in this domain are still uncommitted. At this stage Nodal is expressed in the posterior (right) epiblast but is inhibited by Cerberus secreted by the hypoblast. (B) At stages XIII-2, the hypoblast is displaced from the posterior part of the embryo by the endoblast (white) which allows nodal signaling, in synergy with FGF, to induce Brachyury and Tbx6L and ingression (red arrows) to form the primitive streak (red). (C) At stages 3 ­4, continued FGF signaling now induces Churchill in a domain of the epiblast (turquoise). The border of the epiblast territory destined to ingress to form mesoderm is shown with a dashed black line. (D) At the end of stage 4, Churchill induces Sip1, which blocks Brachyury, Tbx6L, and further ingression of epiblast into the streak. The epiblast remaining outside the streak (blue) is now sensitized to neural-inducing signals emanating from the node (blue arrows). (E) The same model shown as a genetic cascade. Interactions described in this paper are shown as black lines; those from the literature are faint. The time axis runs vertically, wherein the color gradients indicate progressive commitment to epidermis (yellow), neural (blue), and mesoderm (red). BMP/Smad/Sip1 interactions regulate the epidermis-neural plate border, while ChCh/Sip1/FGF/Bra/Tbx6 regulate the mesoderm-neural decision.

BMP4 activity (Verschueren et al., 1999). The association of Sip1 and Smad1 only takes place when Smad1 is activated by phosphorylation (Verschueren et al., 1999; Postigo, 2003; Postigo et al., 2003), raising the possibility that Sip1 acts as a sensor for the status of BMP signaling in the cell. Our findings therefore suggest a simple mechanism by which the node (or FGF) might sensitize cells to BMP antagonists after 5 hr (Streit et al., 1998): induction of ChCh by either a node or by FGF requires 4 hr, then, Sip1 is induced by ChCh, providing cells with a sensor for the status of BMP signaling (Figure 7E). The mechanism by which Sox3 transcription is stabilized is not clear, but Sip1 may play an important role. Two possibilities worth exploring are that association of Sip1 with phospho-Smad1 modulates activating and repressing activities of Sip1 so as to regulate Sox3 transcription,

and that the complex activates proteins that affect the turnover of Sox3 mRNA. Although Churchill is clearly not a neural-inducing factor, our results implicate it in several aspects of this process. By blocking ingression of epiblast through the primitive streak at the end of gastrulation, it allows prospective neural plate cells to remain in the ectoderm, separating the processes of gastrulation and neurulation. As a necessary regulator of Sip1, it controls neural plate and neural crest development (Eisaki et al., 2000; Cacheux et al., 2001; Wakamatsu et al., 2001; Yamada et al., 2001; Van de Putte et al., 2003). It also provides a simple and plausible mechanism by which 5 hr exposure to FGF can sensitize cells to BMP signaling as predicted by previous work (Streit et al., 1998). Finally, by maintaining or enhancing the competence of epiblast

Churchill in Gastrulation and Neural Induction 611

to inducing signals from the node, it sensitizes to neuralinducing signals and may contribute to confine their effects to the prospective neural plate (where ChCh is expressed). Importantly, a recent study of the regulatory regions of Sox2 revealed several binding sites for Sip1 (Uchikawa et al., 2003), and Sip1 misexpression in Xenopus induces neural markers (Papin et al., 2002; Postigo et al., 2003). Neural induction has classically been viewed as a choice between neural and epidermal fates, mainly because it has been studied through grafts of the organizer into prospective epidermal domains. Our results suggest that in the normal embryo a major fate decision is between neural and mesodermal fates, by establishing the boundary that limits cell ingression during gastrulation. This clarifies the otherwise surprising finding that mice mutant for Tbx6 lack paraxial mesoderm and instead make an excess of nervous system (Chapman and Papaioannou, 1998). Churchill May Act with a Cofactor Several observations suggest that although Churchill is an essential regulator of Sip1, it requires one or more cofactors. First, misexpression of Churchill far from its normal domain of expression (e.g., in the area opaca) does not induce Sip1 even though Sip1 contains numerous binding sites for ChCh and despite the finding from morpholino experiments that ChCh is required for normal expression of Sip1. Second, ectopic expression of Churchill in either chick or frog embryos does not induce or repress any of a large panel of markers analyzed (including the neural markers Sox3, ERNI, and Sox2, the epidermal markers E-cadherin, GATA-2 and -3, and the neural plate border markers Msx1 and BMP4). Third, in Xenopus, ChCh protein localizes to the nucleus only shortly before gastrulation, suggesting that nuclear localization is facilitated by a cofactor that is not present at earlier stages. Finally, fusion of ChCh with the VP16 activator domain enhances the effects of wild-type ChCh. By analogy with GATA factors (Fox et al., 1999; Morin et al., 2000; Newton et al., 2001; Patient and McGhee, 2002), one possibility is that one of the zinc fingers binds DNA while the other associates with other proteins, and that these are required for its biological activity. Upstream of Churchill Since a 4 hr lag for induction by either a node or by FGF is a relatively long period, this induction must be indirect. Preliminary examination of genomic sequences of human, mouse, and rat homologs of ChCh revealed a highly conserved 480 bp sequence immediately upstream of the coding region, which contains putative binding sites for 12 transcription factors, of which at least five (GATA-3, SP1/SP5, C/EBP, CREB, and Oct-1) are present in early embryos. Future experiments will establish whether the convergence of several pathways could account for the slow induction of ChCh by FGF. Conclusions Our findings strongly implicate Churchill as a key regulator of the position and timing of subdivision of the epi-

blast into neural and ingressing mesendoderm domains during gastrulation. Since Churchill is induced slowly by FGF yet inhibits some of its targets, this provides a mechanism by which the early embryo can separate, in time and space, two different functions of FGF: a role in mesendoderm formation and a function in early neural development. In addition, FGF4 and -8 can have different activities in different assays, yet both regulate ChCh expression in our system. Thus, FGFs presumably act by multiple different mechanisms in their various roles related to mesoderm induction and migration and the switch to neural induction. The ChCh/Sip1 module reflects one part of a mechanism whose complexity we are only beginning to understand.
Experimental Procedures Chick Embryology Fertile hens' eggs (White Leghorn: SPAFAS, U.S.A.; Henry Stewart & Co., UK) and quails' eggs (Strickland, U.S.A.) were incubated at 38 C to the desired stages. For electroporation and grafts, embryos were explanted and cultured using a modified New culture method (Stern and Ireland, 1981). Methods for Hensen's node grafts (Storey et al., 1992), implantation of sources of secreted factors (FGF4- or FGF8b-soaked heparin beads: Streit et al., 2000; HGF-SF-soaked AG1X2 beads: Streit et al., 1997; or cells expressing Chordin, Noggin, Cerberus, or BMP4: Streit et al., 1998; in situ hybridization and whole mount immunocytochemistry: Stern, 1998) followed published protocols. Fluorescein-tagged morpholinos (ChCh-MO: CGT GCCCACACAGCCCCCGCACATC; control-ChCh: CCTGCTGGACG CAGCCTCCGCACAT and "standard control"; Gene Tools) were electroporated into chick embryos (see below). After in situ hybridization, morpholinos were revealed by antifluorescein immunostaining. Cloning and Sequence Analysis The differential screen for early response genes to Hensen's node was described previously (Streit et al., 2000); this identified an initial clone of chick Churchill containing the entire open reading frame. This was confirmed by screening two chick cDNA libraries (stages 2­4 and stages 12­15). Xenopus ChCh cDNA was obtained from a Xenopus stage 10 cDNA library (kind gift of A. Hemmati-Brivanlou). Human, rat, and mouse ChCh sequences were obtained from database searches, and were confirmed by PCR (for mouse and human) and genomic DNA analysis (for mouse). Zebrafish and Fugu ChCh sequences were obtained from database searches and confirmed by in situ hybridization (in zebrafish). For Northern analysis, 5 g of total RNA from chick embryos at various stages were electrophoresed and the blot probed with a radiolabeled ChCh probe containing the entire open reading frame. Selection A GST-ChCh fusion protein was made by cloning the chick ChCh coding sequence into pGEX-2T. The fusion protein (attached to Glutathione-agarose beads) was used for in vitro binding sequence selection. Selection was carried out in 50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.0125% Triton X-100, 20 g/ml BSA, and 2 g/ml dI-dC. 1 g of annealed oligonucleotides (random 12 mer with constant regions at both ends) were mixed with 100 ng of fusion protein in 500 l selection buffer. After incubation (4 C, 1 hr), the beads were washed three times with ice-cold buffer. Beads were then resuspended in 30 l water and heated at 95 C degrees for 2 min. The oligonucleotides were used for PCR amplification (30 s at 94 C, 30 s at 40 C, and 30 s at 72 C for 25 cycles). 10 l of PCR product was used for the next round of selection, and this repeated five times. PCR products were cloned using pGEM-TEasy. About 30 clones from the selection and mock selection procedures were sequenced. Xenopus Embryology Xenopus oocytes were fertilized in vitro and embryos staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (1967). To make capped mRNA,

Cell 612

the Xenopus ChCh coding sequence was cloned into p- UT3 for wild-type ChCh, p- UT3-EnMT for engrailed repressor, and p- UT2VP16 (vectors kind gift of R. Patient) for VP16 fusion proteins. Capped mRNA was made with mMessage mMachine kits (Ambion). Microinjection was performed as described (Hemmati-Brivanlou and Harland, 1989). For animal cap assays, cap explants from injected embryos were isolated and cultured in 0.5 MMR. RT-PCR primers for Xbra were designed as described (Smith et al., 1991). The Xbra probe was kindly provided by C. Chang (A. H. Brivanlou lab). In situ hybridization was carried out as described (Harland, 1991). Electroporation and Time Lapse Microscopy pCAB-GFP (kind gift of A. Lumsden), encoding GFP driven by the chick -actin promoter, was used to construct pCAB-IRES-GFP, used for all electroporations. An internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) was cloned into a ClaI site in the polylinker (and the 3 ClaI site subsequently destroyed). Chick embryos at stage 3­3 were placed in a plastic chamber containing a Pt cathode embedded in the bottom, exposed to the saline through a 1.5 mm window. The embryo was positioned over the window (dorsal side up), and DNA applied between the dorsal side of the embryo and an adjustable anode (sharpened Pt wire). Three 50 ms pulses of 4­6 volts were given with a TSS10 pulse generator (Intracel). Embryos were then grown to the desired stages. For time lapse microscopy, embryos were photographed every 2 hr using a fluorescence-dissecting microscope; movies were made with a Princeton Instruments cooled CCD camera and Metamorph software (Universal Imaging).
