The signal transduction protein CheY displays an a/b-parallel polypeptide folding, including a highly unstable helix a4 and a strongly charged active site. Helix a4 has been shown to adopt various positions and conformations in different crystal structures, suggesting that it is a mobile segment. Furthermore, the instability of this helix is believed to have functional signi®cance because it is involved in protein-protein contacts with the transmitter protein kinase CheA, the target protein FliM and the phosphatase CheZ. The active site of CheY comprises a cluster of three aspartic acid residues and a lysine residue, all of which participate in the binding of the Mg2 needed for the protein activation. Two steps were followed to study the activation mechanism of CheY upon phosphorylation: ®rst, we independently substituted the three aspartic acid residues in the active site with alanine; second, several mutations were designed in helix a4, both to increase its level of stability and to improve its packing against the protein core. The structural and thermodynamic analysis of these mutant proteins provides further evidence of the connection between the active-site area and helix a4, and helps to understand how small movements at the active site are transmitted and ampli®ed to the protein surface.

Introduction
CheY is the best-characterized member of a large family of bacterial signal transduction proteins (Volz, 1993). This 14 kD protein plays a key role in the control of the bacterial movements in response to environmental chemotactic stimuli (Parkinson, 1978). The chemotactic response is mediated by the transfer of a phosphoryl group from the histidine kinase CheA onto Asp57 of Mg2-bound CheY (Sanders et al., 1989; Lukat et al., 1990). When phosphorylated, CheY binds to the motor of the ¯agellum and switches its rotation from the default counter clockwise mode to a clockwise mode, inducing tumbling behavior (Barak & Eisenbach, 1992; Roman et al., 1992). The deactivation of CheY

through dephosphorylation is due to both its own autophosphatase and CheZ phosphatase activities (Hess et al., 1988). The structures of CheY apo-form from Escherichia coli (Volz & Matsumura, 1991) and Salmonella typhimurium (Stock et al., 1989), the corresponding Mg2-bound forms (Bellsolell et al., 1994; Stock et al., 1993) and complexes with the P2 domain of the protein kinase CheA (Welch et al., 1997; McEvoy et al., 1998) have been determined by Xray crystallography. Moreover, the NMR structure of CheY from Escherichia coli has been determined in the absence, (Bruix et al., 1993; Santoro et al., 1995; Moy et al., 1994) and in the presence, of Mg2 (Bruix, M., personal communication; Moy et al., 1994). CheY is a 129-residue protein, arranged in an a/b parallel motif with a ®ve-stranded parallel b-sheet surrounded by ®ve a-helices. The b-strands and a-helices alternate along the sequence and are connected by loops. The active site is in a pocket

214 located at the C terminus of the central b-sheet and consists of three aspartic acid residues (Asp12 and Asp13 within loop b1-a1, and Asp57 at the C terminus of strand b3) and a lysine residue (Lys109 at the C terminus of strand b5), which are tightly grouped and form a highly negatively charged cluster (Stock et al., 1989; Lukat et al., 1990; Volz & Matsumura, 1991). These residues interact with each other directly or through water molecules. A ®fth residue of the active site, Thr87, either a threonine or a serine residue, is strongly conserved among receiver domains (Volz, 1993). Sometimes it takes part in the hydrogen-bond network of the active site (Santoro et al., 1995) and it can also interact with the b4-a4 loop backbone (Volz & Matsumura, 1991). The magnesium ion is coordinated by two aspartic acid residues (Asp13 and Asp57) and the carbonyl main-chain oxygen atom of Asn59, and three water molecules, like that hydrogen bonding Asp12 and Lys109 (Bellsolell et al., 1994). Although structural information is abundant, no data are available on the active phosphorylated form of CheY, mainly because of its short lifetime. However, the functional study of several mutants and the structural comparison between the apo and metal-bound forms suggested that a conformational change occurs upon CheY activation. In the E. coli CheY-Mg2 co-crystal structure, the loop between strand b5 and helix a5, proximal to the acidic pocket, show signi®cant conformational differences, as well as regions far from the active site, such as loop b4-a4 and helix a4. The latter has been described as an intrinsically ¯exible area (Bellsolell et al., 1994, 1996; Santoro et al., 1995) The recent structure determination of the phosphorylated forms of the related proteins FixJ (Birck et al., 1999) and NtrC (Kern et al., 1999) has con®rmed that major structural changes occur in these areas of loop b4-a4 and helix a4 upon phosphorylation. Furthermore, all these segments have been reported to be functionally important (Roman et al., 1992; Sockett et al., 1992; McEvoy et al., 1999; Shukla & Matsumura, 1995; Zhu et al., 1997b), but the transmission of the signal from the active site to the b5-a5 and b4-a4 regions, allegedly involved in passing the signal to the downstream target, remains unknown. In order to analyze the stability structural determinants of these functionally important areas in detail, we have undertaken a thermodynamic and crystallographic study of point mutated forms. The amino acid residues selected for substitutions are the three catalytical aspartic acid residues and different residues from helix a4.

Results
Design of the mutants In order to analyze the contribution of speci®c residues to the stability of the whole protein CheY, we designed two sets of mutants (Figure 1) after

inspection and comparison between the apo-CheY (PDB code 3CHY; Volz & Matsumura, 1991) and Mg2-bound structures (PDB code 1CHN; Bellsolell et al., 1994). The design of the active-site Â mutants has been described elsewhere (LopezÂ Hernandez & Serrano, 1996) and, in summary, it entailed the elimination of the interaction between a speci®c side-chain and the rest of the protein, and the subsequent measurement of some unfolding parameters in order to characterize the transition state. To that end, the three active site aspartic acid residues Asp12, Asp13 and Asp57 (for CheY numbering see Table 1 by Volz, 1993) were substituted one by one by an alanine, a smaller and apolar residue which should show fewer interactions than the mutated residue. Accordingly, three single-point mutants were produced: D12A (Asp12Ala), D13A (Asp13Ala) and D57A (Asp57Ala). Another set of mutations affected the helix a4 area (Figure 1). We know from circular dichroism and NMR studies using peptides based on the CheY sequence, that the helix a4 (residues 91 to 99) has a very low intrinsic a-helix potential and that it shows a tendency to nucleate from Asn94, which Ä could act as a good N-cap (Munoz et al., 1995). The helix is weakly packed against the rest of the protein, leaving a large cavity below Ala98. We introduced several mutations to this helix following two strategies: increasing the intrinsic helical stability of helix a4, and improving the packing against the protein core. The helix-coil transition algorithm Ä AGADIR (Munoz & Serrano, 1997; Lacroix et al., 1998) was used for the design of these helix a4 mutations. This algorithm has been successfully

used to increase the helical propensities of proteins containing a-helices, such as the activation domain of procarboxypeptidase A (Villegas et al., 1996) and CheY with a set of mutations in a4 different from Â Â the ones described here (Lopez-Hernandez et al., 1997). Three mutants were made in the region of helix a4 of CheY. The ®rst mutant (Hel41) bears a Lys91Asp mutation to provide the helix a4 with favorable N-capping (Serrano & Fersht, 1989), together with the removal of unfavorable electrostatic negative interactions with the helix dipole. In general, it is dif®cult to ®nd Lys as an N-cap (the most common residues are Ser, Asn, Gly, Asp and Thr; Richardson & Richardson, 1988). Accordingly, we replaced the residue Lys91 by another one with a greater tendency to act as an N-cap, and we found that Asp was the best candidate for helices with a highly exposed N terminus (Serrano & Fersht, 1989). The second mutant (Hel42), designed to increase further helix stability, contains the mutations Lys91Asp, Lys92Ala and Ile96Lys. Ala was introduced in position 92 on the grounds of its high tendency to adopt an a-helical conformation (Chakrabartty et al., 1991) and to prevent a destabilizing interaction with the helix macrodipole (Nicholson et al., 1991). The two residues with the greatest tendency to adopt the helix conformation are Ala, which is a good helix initiator, and Leu (Lyu et al., 1993). Finally, the exposed Ile96 was substituted by Lys, which shows both a higher level of hydrophilicity and a-helix propensity (Serrano et al., 1992), and introduces a favorable

electrostatic i,i À 3 interaction (with Glu93). The third mutant (Hel43) contains the three mutations of Hel42 plus mutation Ala98 to Leu, designed to improve the packing of the helix against the protein core. This residue is ¯anking the cavity between helix a4 and the central b-sheet of CheY where Tyr106 intercalates, as seen in the Mg2 CheY variant (Bellsolell et al., 1994). The predicted increase in a-helical propensity of peptides corresponding to these mutant helices is given in Table 2. Mg2 binding and stability of the active site and helix a 4 mutants As summarized in Tables 1 and 2, the mutants designed show more stability than the native apoprotein. The suppression of a negatively charged side-chain results in a less electronegative active site for proteins D12A, D13A and D57A, implying a reduction of repellent interactions in the catalytic cleft. Comparing the active-site mutants with each other, D57A and D13A are slightly more stable than D12A (Table 1). Neither D13A nor D57A increase their level of stability in the presence of Mg2, but the addition of the metal signi®cantly enhances the stability of the apo-protein and mutant D12A. This results could correlate with the fact that residues Asp13 and Asp57 are directly involved in the coordination of the metal ion (Bellsolell et al., 1994), while the interaction of Asp12 with the cation is mediated by a water mol-

216 ecule and Lys109. Therefore, the mutants D13A and D57A have probably lost the ability to bind the metal, unlike D12A that can still bind it. This agrees with the fact that the mutant D12A could only be crystallized in the presence of magnesium. As a whole, all these results show that decreasing the total negative charge of the active site, either by mutations that eliminate a negative polar residue or by the introduction of a positive charge such as the magnesium cation, increases the level of protein stability (Meiering et al., 1992). All the mutants designed at helix a4, Hel41, Hel42 and Hel43 have gained stability (Table 2). Figure 2 shows the changes in ¯uorescence emission of the mutants upon the addition of varying amounts of urea. Fitting the data to a two-state transition curve allows us to determine the free energy of unfolding for the different proteins. As expected, the introduction in Hel41 of a good N-capping residue (Lys91Asp) improves protein stabilization. Further stabilization (of about 1 kcal molÀ1 with respect to the apo-protein) is obtained by adding the mutations Lys92Ala and Ile96Lys (mutant Hel42) to Lys91Asp. Finally, the introduction of mutation Ala98Leu to increase the packing of the protein by ®lling a cavity signi®cantly increases the level of stability of the mutant Hel43 (0.8 kcal molÀ1 in comparison with Hel42). Titration with magnesium shows that the stabilization of helix a4 results in a decrease of the Kd for this cation (Table 2). Overall structure comparison between the mutants and apo-CheY In order to interpret structurally these stability results, we analyzed the structure of the previously mentioned mutants D12A, D13A, D57A and Hel43 by X-ray. The polypeptide fold of mutants D13A and D57A is basically identical to that of the apoprotein (Figure 3a,b) as exempli®ed by the root mean square (rms) deviations of the Ca position of Ê the proteins, which yielded values of 0.43 A and Ê , respectively. For D12A, the differences are 0.25 A Ê larger and the overall Ca deviation is 0.91 A, with Ê a maximum of 4.5 A at position 90. The analysis of the D12A mutant structure shows that the areas altered are far away from the active site and coincide with those distorted when magnesium ions are added to the crystallization condition solution (Bellsolell et al., 1994). Nevertheless, the Ca superposition deviation between D12A and the Ê Mg2-bound CheY mentioned is higher (1.3 A) than with the apo form, indicating that the threedimensional structure of this mutant is closer to the apo-protein than the metal-bound one. The rms differences between Ca for all residues of the mutant Hel43 and native apo-CheY are Ê 0.26 A, revealing a strong similarity between them, although signi®cant differences appear in the zone Ê where the mutations are located: 0.7 A for the helix a4 Ca atoms.

Mutations Asp13Ala and Asp57Ala have local effects The D13A crystal structure shows local adjustments of the loops around the active-site pocket (Figure 4(a)): the loop b3-a3 (residues 60-63) moves towards the space freed by the Asp13 to Ala mutation, with a maximum Ca deviation from the Ê apo-protein at residue Asn62 (1.5 A), approximating Pro61 to Ala13, which create an hydrophobic cavity. In addition, Phe14, which is exposed to the solvent in the apo structure, slightly moves both its Ê main and side-chains (the ®rst by 0.7 A and the  second by rotation a about w1 of 18 ) to the new apolar space created by the mutation. Furthermore, Asp also rotates to make a new hydrogen bond between the Od1 and the backbone N of Phe14. The overall changes in D57A are negligible. In the D57A active site (Figure 4(b)), Lys109 looses a very important electrostatic partner due to the mutation. This residue displaces its Nz from its position inside the active pocket (where it was bound to Asp57 in the apo-protein), towards Met17 which, in turn, moves its side-chain. The amino group of Lys109 shows greater mobility than in the apo-CheY, as a weak electron density is observed for Nx. The mutation Asp12Ala at the active site strongly alters loop b 4-a 4 a The Asp12 to Ala substitution in the mutant D12A has structural effects not only on the residues around the mutation but also on the loops located at the C terminus of the central b-sheet that surround the active site (Figure 3(a)).

(b) Stereo representation of the area region around residue Leu98 in the mutant Hel43. Atoms interacting with the Leu98 side-chain are highlighted as spheres. The inner orientation of Tyr106 in the apo-CheY (PDB entry 3CHY; Volz & Matsumura, 1991) is shown in darker thin bonds.

First, the free space released by the elimination of the carboxyl chain is partially occupied by residues from the loop b1-a1 (residues 13 to 17, Figure 4(c)). In particular, two residues move their side-chains towards Ala12: Met17 by displacing its Ê sulfur atom by almost 3 A, and Phe14 by rotating w1 28  . Here the latter shows its tendency to avoid hydrophilic environments. Phe14 is, in the wildtype protein, an exposed and rather destabilizing residue whose replacement to alanine or asparaÄ gine increases the stability of the molecule (Munoz et al., 1994; Wilcock et al., 1998). Asp13 avoids steric clashes with the new position of Phe14 by breaking its bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Asp59, rotating w1 from gauche À to gauche , and being now exposed to the solvent.

Second, since the Met 17 side-chain is located between the Lys109 and Phe111 side-chains (residues at the loop b5-a5), its displacement also affects the whole b5-a5 loop (for instance, the Ê Pro110 Ca moves 1.5 A). The main-chain of Lys109 is also displaced but the Nx atom keeps the position found in the apo-CheY, interacting with Asp57. The carboxylic plane of the aspartyl sidechain has rotated almost 90  with respect to apoCheY, and the chain has both carboxylic oxygen atoms interacting with the Nx group instead of having the single oxygen atom observed in the apo-CheY structure. Moreover, due to the Asp57 carboxylic plane rotation, the interaction between its Od2 and the Asn59 backbone amide group is broken. Halfway between the mutated Asp12 and

The side-chains of key residues are shown, including Trp58, Thr87 and Tyr106. The inwards alternative orientation of Tyr106 in the apo-CheY was not drawn for clarity.

the rotated Asp13 appears a new water molecule that hydrogen bonds to three different atoms: the Asp13 amide (as the Asp12 Od2 does in the apostructure), the Od2 of Asp57 and the carbonyl O atom of Asn59. The amide nitrogen atom of Lys109 and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Thr87 establish the last hydrogen bond between b-strand 4 and b-strand 5. The backbone displacement at residue 109 towards the loop b4-a4 (residues 89 to 91) enlarges the active site and pushes the Thr87 main-chain, thus starting a disarrangement cascade at loop b4-a4 which extends to helix a4 (Figure 4(d)). It might be noted that in the D12A active-site mutant, the loop b4-a4 is the area where major main-chain displacements occur. The B-factors in this loop region are rather high when compared to those found in the apo-Chey and the other active-site mutants (i.e. the difference between the mean B-factor of the loop and the rest of the protein is about twofold higher

in the D12A mutant), an indication of its increased level of mobility. The movement of the Thr87 Ê main-chain (1.3 A at its Ca) relocates its side-chain as well, which results in the loss of the interaction between its g-hydroxyl and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Glu89 (at loop b4-a4 backbone). Instead, a new hydrogen bond between the Thr87 Og1 and the Nd2 of Asn94 (from helix a4 and to which the threonine residue was waterbridged in the apoprotein) is formed, involving an approximation of Ê both the C terminus of strand b4 (displaced 2.2 A at Ala88 Ca) and the N terminus of the helix a4 Ê (moved 2.5 A at Lys92). Besides, the b4-a4 turn moves out towards the solvent, with Ala90 disÊ placed 4.8 A and completely exposed at the furthest point of the loop arch. The neighboring residues Ala88 and Glu89 ¯ip their backbone angles, and Lys91 looses its involvement in the helix a4 hydrogen bond system, so that Lys92 is the ®rst residue of the helix.

219 protein structure, Tyr106 was modeled as two different rotamers: an inner rotamer, occupying the hydrophobic cavity, and an outer rotamer, exposed to the solvent (Volz, 1993). A third rotamer, with the hydroxyl group pointing towards helix a4, was found in the Mg2-CheY structure (Bellsolell et al., 1994). Functional and structural studies have established a link between the rotameric orientation of this residue and the signaling ability of the protein (Zhu et al., 1996, 1997a). In mutant D12A, Tyr106 is in the outer conformation, since the inner conformation is hindered by the new positions of Thr87 and Ile95.

The approximation of the N terminus of helix a4 to strand b4 causes a rearrangement, narrowing the interface between a4 and strands b3 and b4 and changing the spatial disposition of Trp58 and Tyr106 side-chains. Changes in the active site result in a ¯uorescent quenching for Trp58 (Lukat et al., 1990), probably as a result of an activating conformational change of the protein (Kar et al., 1992). Indeed, a movement of the Trp58 moiety was described in the Mg2-CheY structure (Bellsolell et al., 1994), where unwinding of the helix a4 was concomitant with the substitution of the Trp58 stacking partner Asn94 for Glu93. In the apo-

220 Structure of the quadruple mutant Hel43 The structure of Hel43 shows a displacement of helix a4 from its original position in the apo-protein (Figure 5(a)). The N terminus helix a4 moves away from the protein core, in particular from b4. The displacement affects residue Thr87 again, at Ê the C terminus of b4, whose Ca atom moves 0.5 A (see Figure 5(b)) although it maintains the same interactions with loop b4-a4 as observed in the native apo-CheY. The displacement increases for every residue along from the sequence from Thr87, Ê reaching a maximum at Ala90 (1.3 A) at the b4-a4 loop. The subsequent helix a4 is affected up to Ê Ala99, with Ca displacements between 0.4 and 1 A. From residue Ala99 on, both Hel43 and apo-CheY proteins are practically identical. On the other hand, the active sites of the two proteins are equivalent. In the native apo-structure, the initial helix a4 main-chain nitrogen atoms (corresponding to the residues Lys91, Ala92 and Glu93) are exposed to the solvent, and the amide nitrogen atom of Ile95 has the ®rst intra-helical interaction, in particular with the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of Lys91. A Lys residue is not appropriate for an helical N-cap; in the native structure, the side chain is completely exposed, and the Nz is far away from the helix. In contrast, in the Hel43 mutant, the electron density maps show very clearly that the side-chain of Asp91 is located right over the helix cylinder of a4, in a suitable conformation for acting as an N-cap through its interaction with the helix dipole. The Asp91 side-chain position over the helix is clear for molecule A in the asymmetric unit but not for the other three molecules, where the electron density is weak, showing that the mutations have not eliminated completely the helix a4 intrinsic ¯exibility. In agreement with the new capping interaction, the Hel41 protein is more stable than the WT by $0.4 kcal molÀ1. The hydrophobic cavity between the helix a4 and the protein core is ®lled up now by the side-chain of Leu98 (Figure 5(c)-(d)), resulting in the displacement of the side-chain of Trp58, a small adjustment to accommodate the bulkier leucine side-chain. In the Hel43 mutant, Tyr106 is found in the outer conformation (Figure 3(b)), since the inner conformation would cause clashes with the side-chain of Leu98.

Stabilizing Mutations in CheY

helix 4 mutant containing all stabilizing interactions. The interpretation of the results sheds a new light on the CheY activating mechanism. CheY is an unstable protein In CheY, disruption of the active-site electronegative charge results in a signi®cant stabilization of the protein (up to 4 kcal/mol), as described for other enzymes (Meiering et al., 1992; Shoichet et al., 1995). Likewise, as expected from a switch region, helix a4 packs poorly with the rest of the protein. Improving either the local stability of the helix or its packing with the rest of the protein results in signi®cant stabilization of the protein ($1.8 kcal/ mol). This means that, in the native apo-protein, the other areas are somehow keeping both the active site and the helix a4 unstable conformations. In CheY and other two-component receiver modules, the preservation during the evolution of such instability can be interpreted if the functional role of the area is taken into account, as the ¯exibility of the b4-a4 zone allows the proteins to suffer large conformational signaling changes when a small modi®cation occurs at the active site pocket. Therefore, the receiver modules can act as a regulable and signaling molecular switch. Mg binding CheY is phosphorylated only in the presence of Mg2. This cation binds to the three aspartic residues of the active site, either directly (Asp57 and 13) or through a water molecule (Asp12) (Bellsolell et al., 1994). Our results show that the level of CheY stability increases when the metal is present, which shows that the binding is taking place. As expected, deletion of the aspartic residues 13 or 57 abolishes the magnesium binding, as shown by the immutability of the stability either in presence or absence of the cation. This is not the case for D12A, where the increase of the stability when Mg2 is present indicates that the molecule can still bind the cation, although a waterbridge from the octahedral sphere of the metal co-ordination is lost. Concerning the helix a4 mutants, we observe a similar decrease of the binding constant for Mg2 (Table 2) in the three Hel41, Hel42 and Hel43. Only the Lys91 to Asp mutation is shared by the three mutants, and it is the only one present in Hel41. The structure of Hel43 reveals that the new aspartic at position 91 is involved in a new capping interaction that stabilizes the helix. Electrostatic surface representation (data not shown) indicates that the mutation also results in an increased electronegative charge in an area bordering the activesite face. The substitution of the positively charged Lys side-chain for the negatively Asp residue is therefore likely to increase the degree of af®nity for the cation by a pure electrostatic attractive effect. Unfortunately we were unable to obtain crystals of the mutant proteins bounded to the metal. However, in agreement with the above mentioned

Discussion
We have analyzed the communication between the active site of CheY and the b4-a4 loop, one of the regions thought to interact with the ¯agellum motor and CheZ. To that end, we have solved the three-dimensional structures of three punctual mutants affected in one of the three active-site aspartic residues, which were substituted by alanine. At the same time we have stabilized the helix a4 through local interactions, improved the packing of this helix against the rest of the protein, and determined the three-dimensional structure of the

hypothesis, we observed that, in another mutant series, mutation of Lys91 to Gly also increases the af®nity for Mg2, but to a lesser extent (Lacroix, E., Cronet, P., E.L., P.C. & L.S., unpublished results). Structural analysis and implications for the switch mechanism As Asp57 is the site of phosphorylation, and given that a mutation of Lys109 results in the inactivation of the protein (Lukat et al., 1991), it has been suggested that this lysine residue is a key residue that transmits the events that occur in the active site to the rest of the protein through an activating conformational change which includes the breakage at the Asp57-Lys109 interaction (Lukat et al., 1991; Bellsolell et al., 1996). In the D57A mutant, the interaction is obviously lost, but the subsequent Lys109 side-chain movement does not seem to alter the structure which, among the three mutants, is the most similar to the apo-protein structure. On the other hand, mutation of Asp12 to Ala does not disrupt the interaction Asp57-Lys109, but has a long-range effect on loop b4-a4 and helix a4, which are far from the activesite pocket and are considered as part of the CheY signaling surface (Sockett et al., 1992; Roman et al., 1992; McEvoy et al., 1999; Shukla & Matsumura, 1995; Zhu et al., 1997b). These results indicate that the simple loss of the interaction between the Asp57 and the Lys109 side-chains does not necessarily lead to conformational changes in the CheY structure. However, when a concomitant Lys109Thr87 main-chain movement occurs, as is observed in the D12A mutant, the b4a4 area is clearly distorted. These two highly conserved residues, Lys109 and Thr87 (Volz, 1993), seem to transmit changes from the catalytical cleft to the signaling b4-a4 surface, through loop b5-a5 main chain movements and loop b4-a4 main chain distortions. Mutational and functional studies suggest that the Thr87 residue is, like Lys109, required for the activation of CheY (Ganguli 1995, Appleby 1998). Structural data indicate that Thr87 is topologically in contact with the Lys109 main-chain, interacts with active-site water molecules in the apo-CheY, and participates in the structural arrangement of the b4a4 area (Volz & Matsumura, 1991; Bellsolell et al., 1994, 1996; Santoro et al., 1995; Wilcock et al., 1998; this work). The structure of the FixJ receiver phosphorylated at the active site has also shown structural changes at the b4-a4 loop concomitant with a reorientation of the equivalent threonine residue (Birk et al., 1999). In the Mg2-CheY structure (Bellsolell et al., 1994), there is also a displacement of Lys109 main-chain, but in a different direction from the D12A mutant. Although loop b5-a5 undergoes different movements in both structures, a distortion in the b4-a4 area occurs and, in particular, the Thr87 g-hydroxyl is no longer involved in the architectural loop organization in either case. Therefore, the analysis of all the data obtained so far suggests that Thr87 stabilizes the

Material and Methods
Site directed mutagenesis and mutant protein preparations The mutants were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis derived from the polymerase chain reaction (Landt et al., 1990). The cloning was performed using a vector derived from the Ptz18U (Pharmacia). Detailed procedures of the cloning, expression and puri®cation of the mutants have been described elsewhere (Bruix et al., Ä Â Â 1993; Munoz et al., 1994; Lopez-Hernandez & Serrano, 1996). Denaturation Urea-induced denaturation experiments were monitored by the changes in ¯uorescence emission upon Ä Â unfolding, as reported (Munoz et al., 1994; LopezÂ Hernandez & Serrano, 1996; Filimonov et al., 1993) on a SLM Aminco Bowman Serie 2 ¯uorometer using 1 cm path length cuvettes, with excitation at 290 nm and emission at 315 nm. The unfolding curves data were ®tted with the same equation described in the work mentioned (Filimonov et al., 1993). Each curve was repeated twice. Protein crystallization Crystals of mutants D12A, D13A, D57A and Hel43 where grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 4  C. Aliquots of 6 ml containing 9.6 mg/ml of D12A, 0.1 M magnesium acetate, 10 % polyethyleneglycol (PEG) 8000 and 50 mM cacodilate buffer (pH 6.5) were equilibrated against 0.2 M magnesium acetate, 20 % PEG 8000 and 100 mM cacodilate buffer (pH 6.5). Both D13A and D57A crystallization drops contained 12.5 % PEG 8000 and 50 mM cacodilate buffer, and either 8.25 mg/ml of D13A (pH 7.2) or 6.8 mg/ml of D57A (pH 7.0), both equilibrated against 25 % PEG 8000, 100 mM cacodilate buffer at the corresponding pH. Crystals of mutant Hel43 were from 8 ml hanging drops containing 3.9 mg/ml of protein, 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.5) and 1.2 M ammonium sulfate, equilibrated against a reservoir containing 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.5) and 2.4 M ammonium sulfate. All of the mutant protein crystals were mounted in capillaries for data collection after stabilization in a solution containing the mother liquor with increased amounts of precipitant: 25 % PEG 8000 (D12A and D13A), 30 % PEG 8000 (D57A) or 3.0 M ammonium sulfate (Hel43). Data collection and processing The mutants crystallized in two forms: the Hel43 crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P21 and all the active-site mutants belong to the P212121 orthorhombic space group. Only the D12A and D57A crystals are isomorphous with the native apo crystal (Volz & Matsumura, 1991). All data sets were collected using a Mar Research Imaging Plate area detector, processed with XDS (Kabsch, 1988) and scaled and merged with PROTEIN (Steigemann, 1991) (Table 2). X-ray diffraction

data for D12A and D13A were obtained in-house at 20  C using an Elliot GX21 rotating anode generator. The Ê D12A crystals unit cell dimensions are a  40.1 A, Ê Ê Ê b  54.3 A and c  60.6 A, and a 2.0 A resolution data set was collected. The D13A crystals have unit cell Ê Ê Ê dimensions of a  46.1 A, b  49.4 A and c  53.7 A, and a data set was collected at a maximum resolution of Ê 1.9 A. For D57A, high and low resolution X-ray diffraction data were collected separately from the same crystal, using synchrotron radiation at beamline X-31 of the Hamburg synchrotron (DESY-EMBL outstation). The high and low-resolution data sets were scaled and merged together with PROTEIN (see Table 3 for statistics). The unit cell dimensions of D57A crystals are Ê Ê Ê a  45.8 A, b  47.7 A and c  54.1 A. The Matthews parameter (Matthews, 1968) indicated that the three active-site mutant crystals contained one molecule per Ê asymmetric unit with VM values of 2.4 A3/Da for D12A, Ê Ê 2.2 A3/Da for D13A and 2.1 A3/Da for D57A. For mutant Hel43, two data sets were collected from two crystals at 4  C. The ®rst data set was collected to a maxiÊ mum resolution of 2.1 A in-house, and the second at beamline X-31 at DESY to a maximum resolution of Ê 1.75 A. The results of the merging and scaling of both data sets are shown in Table 3. The Hel43 crystal belongs to the space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of Ê Ê Ê a  53.85 A, b  109.76 A, c  54.00 A, and b  111.09o, with four protein molecules in the asymmetric unit Ê (VM  2.65 A3/Da). Structure determination and refinement All structures were solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The starting model for the D12A mutant was the structure of the triple mutant Phe14Gly-Ser15Gly-Met17Gly previously solved in our laboratory (PDB entry 1YMV; Bellsolell et al., 1996). The R-factor and correlation coef®cient of the solution peak were 29.3 % and 76.4 %, respectively, contrasting clearly with the rest of the peaks. For D13A, D57A and Hel43 the coordinates of the E. coli apo-protein CheY were used as a starting model (PDB entry 3CHY; Volz & Matsumura, 1991). For the two-active site mutants D13A and D57A, clear peaks were obtained with R-factors of 29.8 % and 27.2 %, and correlation coef®cients of 77.5 %

and 79.0 %, corresponding to the respective solutions, which were clearly higher than the rest of the molecular replacement peaks. In order to locate the four molecules in the asymmetric unit of Hel43, the translation function was sequentially calculated over four rotation function solutions previously found. A ®rst translation was calculated using the rotation with the highest correlation coef®cient. This rotation-translation solution was then ®xed in order to start a new translation search over the second rotation solution, and so on, until the four positions of the molecule were located in the asymmetric unit. At the end, the molecular replacement search yielded a peak with a correlation coef®cient of 69.4 % and an R-factor 32.0 %, which corresponded to the ®nal solution. During the re®nement process 10 % of the re¯ections È were set aside for the R-free calculation (Brunger, 1992a). È The re®nement was carried out with X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992b), while model building was performed with TURBO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1989). In general, the re®nement procedures started using Ê data up to 3.5 A and the resolution was increased in Ê steps to 3.0 A. At this stage, 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps were calculated. The interpretation of the D13A and D57A electron density maps was straightforward, while loop a4-b4 and helix a4 of D12A needed extensive manual building. The Fourier maps of Hel43 were initially noisy in the mutated helix a4 region and therefore solvent ¯attening and NCS averaging was applied with PHASES (Furey et al., 1990), which enabled us to ®t correctly the mutated residues in the electron density. NCS restraints were used for Hel43 at the early stages of re®nement. The re®nement continued with positional re®nement and a few simulated annealing cycles, increasing the Ê resolution stepwise to 2.4 A when atomic isotropic B-factors were re®ned with restraints imposed on atoms directly bonded. Solvent molecules were included in the structure and more cycles of positional re®nement, B-factor re®nement and manual building were perÊ formed, increasing the resolution to a maximum of 1.9 A Ê (Hel43 and D13A) and 2.0 A (D12A and D57A). With the exception of some residues at the N terminus of the proteins, all other residues are clearly visible in the electron density: all residues plus the initial methionine residue were included for D12A, residues 3 to 129 for D13A,
