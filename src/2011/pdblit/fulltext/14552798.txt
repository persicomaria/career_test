Roche Research Center Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. Nutley NJ 07110, USA We report crystal structures of the human enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) with and without bound substrates. These structures are the ®rst to be determined for a GTP-dependent PEPCK, and provide the ®rst view of a novel GTP-binding site unique to the GTPdependent PEPCK family. Three phenylalanine residues form the walls of the guanine-binding pocket on the enzyme's surface and, most surprisingly, one of the phenylalanine side-chains contributes to the enzyme's speci®city for GTP. PEPCK catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the metabolic pathway that produces glucose from lactate and other precursors derived from the citric acid cycle. Because the gluconeogenic pathway contributes to the fasting hyperglycemia of type II diabetes, inhibitors of PEPCK may be useful in the treatment of diabetes.

Introduction
In healthy individuals, gluconeogenesis serves to maintain normal blood sugar levels during periods of fasting. In diabetic patients, gluconeogenesis contributes signi®cantly to fasting hyperglycemia.1,2 The large number of individuals affected (15 million in the United States) lends urgency to the search for better treatments. Novel therapies based on reducing the ¯ux through glu-

coneogenesis could help normalize fasting blood glucose levels in diabetic patients.3 The rate-limiting enzyme in the gluconeogenic pathway, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate (OAA) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The high-energy phosphate bond is derived from GTP in animals, in the reversible reaction: OAA  GTP  PEP  CO2  GDP In the reaction catalyzed by PEPCK from bacterial, fungal, and plant sources, ATP is the phosphate donor. The three-dimensional structure of the Escherichia coli enzyme has been reported, as well as its complexes with ATP and OAA analogs.4 ± 6 Although the overall sequence identity between the mammalian and bacterial enzymes is less than 20 %, a number of residues at the active site are conserved across all species, and the reaction mechanism is thought to be the same in mammals and bacteria. In order to gain insight into the speci®city of the mammalian enzymes for GTP and obtain a solid basis for drug design, we have

Results
Complex with GTP The structure of PEPCK with b,g-methylene GTP bound reveals a new binding-site for GTP, unique to the PEPCK family. The nucleotide base of the GTP analog ®ts snugly into a pocket on the enzyme surface (Figure 2). The aromatic residues Phe517, Phe525, and Phe530 form three walls of the pocket, with the guanine base sandwiched between the side-chains of Phe517 and Phe530. Phe517 is strictly conserved in the GTP-dependent PEPCK family; residues 525 and 530 are either Phe or Tyr in all members of the family. Searches of the Protein Data Bank for structures with binding sites

consisting of a similar motif of three Phe or Tyr residues yielded no hits, indicating the binding site is unique to the GTP-dependent PEPCK fold.7 Several hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and the guanine base ensure speci®city for GTP over ATP and other potential nucleotide substrates (Figure 2). The C6 carbonyl oxygen atom of the guanine base accepts two hydrogen bonds from Phe530 (backbone NH) and Asn533 (side-chain NH2). A water molecule accepts a hydrogen bond from the guanine N1 while in turn donating two hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl groups of residues Trp516 and Trp527. The guanine's exocyclic N2 amino group is appropriately positioned to donate a hydrogen bond to the water molecule Ê as well, although the distance (3.2-3.3 A) suggests a weak interaction. A second water molecule accepts hydrogen bonds from N7 of guanine and the side-chain of Trp516, while donating a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly289. In addition, the p electron system of Phe525

259 the N termini and in the loops between secondary structural elements. More marked differences are seen in comparing the bound nucleotide substrates and their interactions with the two enzymes. In the complex between the human enzyme and GTP, the guanine base and ribose moiety are anti with respect to one another, while in the E. coli structure ATP is bound with the adenine base and ribose moiety in the syn conformation (Figure 3(c) and (d)). The X-ray structure agrees with recently reported results of an NMR study.13 The NMR results showed that in the complex between GTP and the rat liver cytosolic PEPCK, the GTP binds with the guanine base and ribose moiety in anti geometry. The pocket that accepts the adenine base in the E. coli enzyme differs dramatically from the guanine-binding pocket of the human enzyme. In the E. coli enzyme's complex with ATP, the adenine base is sandwiched between the side-chain of Ile452 and the guanidinium group of Arg449. The walls of the binding pocket are formed by different residues in the E. coli enzyme; residues 441 to 455 of the E. coli enzyme span a ¯exible region that adopts a different conformation in the absence of ATP. In contrast, a comparison of the GTP-bound and GTP-free human enzyme structures reveals only minor differences in the architecture of the guanine-binding pocket. Hence, the switch in speci®city from ATP to GTP involves a major redesign of the binding pocket for the nucleotide substrate's base, both in terms of the residues utilized to construct the pocket and the ¯exibility of the pocket's walls in the absence of a bound nucleotide. Further comparison of the E. coli and human PEPCK structures shows that the interactions between the enzymes and the ribose moiety of the nucleotide substrate are not conserved. In the structure of human PEPCK with GTP, the ribose 3H and ring oxygen atoms accept hydrogen bonds from the side-chain of Arg436, which also donates hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl group of Ala287. In the E. coli complex, the side-chain of Glu297 accepts a hydrogen bond from the ribose 2H -hydroxyl group, and a water molecule mediates hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and the ribose 3H -hydroxyl group. The residues involved in liganding the Mg2 and Mn2 metal ions at the active site are identical in the ATP and GTP-utilizing PEPCKs, as was predicted by sequence comparisons. The structural similarity in this region of the active site is not unexpected, as the bacterial and mammalian enzymes carry out the same decarboxylation and phosphotransfer reactions in converting OAA to PEP. In the human enzyme complexed with the GTP analog, the Mg ion is coordinated octahedrally by oxygen atoms from the b and g phosphate groups of the nucleotide, the sidechain of Thr291, and three water molecules (Figure 3(c)). The Mn ion is coordinated by an oxygen atom of the g phosphate group, the side-

appears to be involved in a favorable interaction with the exocyclic N2 amino group of the guanine base. The importance of this interaction is supported by biophysical data on the enzyme's af®nity for different nucleotides. The dissociation constants measured by isothermal titration calorimetry were 0.5 mM for GTP, 4 mM for ITP, and >100 mM for XTP. The amino-p interaction is possible only when GTP is bound. The interaction is missing when ITP is bound, and replaced by an unfavorable interaction between a carbonyl oxygen atom and the p electrons when XTP is bound. This mode of GTP binding, with a substantial component of the af®nity derived from an amino-p interaction, has not been seen to date in structures of other GTP-bound proteins. Sequence comparisons of GTP-dependent and ATP-dependent PEPCKs have been used to predict which residues of the GTP-dependent family might be responsible for GTP-binding.8,9 The X-ray structure reported here shows that the predictions have been accurate with respect to the residues of the Ploop involved in phosphate binding, but efforts to predict residues involved in speci®city for GTP were not successful. The purine repressor (PurR) provides an interesting comparison, in that it achieves speci®city for guanine via a different mechanism. The crystal structure of PurR bound to the corepressor guanine shows that the exocyclic N2 amino group of the purine base donates a hydrogen bond to a water molecule, which in turn donates hydrogen bonds to a glutamate side-chain and backbone carbonyl oxygen atom.10 Hypoxanthine, which lacks an exocyclic substituent at C2, functions as a corepressor while xanthine does not. The factors that prevent xanthine from being recognized as a corepressor are the mismatched hydrogen bonding capability of the exocyclic O2 oxygen atom and the poor electrostatic complementarity between xanthine and the binding site. Other examples of enzymes speci®c for guanine nucleotides are known: hydrogen bonds between the purine base and protein main-chain atoms, side-chain atoms, or bound water molecules can all be exploited to discriminate between GTP and other nucleotides as substrates.11,12 PEPCK is unusual, in that the p system of a phenylalanine residue is involved in the discrimination. Thus, several structural solutions to the problem of discriminating between alternate nucleotide substrates have been discovered, and the features of the binding sites that are responsible for discrimination are not easy to predict in the absence of three-dimensional structural information. Comparison with ATP-dependent PEPCK Despite the low level of sequence similarity between the bacterial and mammalian enzymes, the fold of the human enzyme is very similar to that of the Escherichia coli enzyme (Figure 3(a) and (b)). Slight differences in the folds can be seen at

261 (Figure 4(a)). Two of the water ligands bridge the Mn2 and the terminal oxygen atoms of PEP's phosphate moiety. PEP binds as a 1:1 complex with a Na ion. The negative charge on the phosphate is counterbalanced by the side-chains of Arg87, Arg405, and the Na ion. The carboxylate group of PEP is held by interactions with the main-chain NH groups of Arg87 and Gly417 and the side-chain amide group of Asn403. The edge of the aromatic side-chain of Tyr235 forms part of the Ê binding site for the carboxylate group, 3.3 A from one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms. This edge-on interaction between a carboxylate oxygen atom

phosphate groups of the GTP analog are positioned such that their oxygen atoms are nearly eclipsed. By stabilizing a high-energy conformation of the terminal phosphoanhydride linkage of the nucleotide substrate, the enzyme is thought to lower the activation energy for phosphoryl group transfer. Complex with PEP In the complex of human PEPCK with PEP, no Mg ion is present, and the Mn ion is liganded by Lys244, His264, Asp311, and three water molecules

262 and an aromatic side-chain is energetically favorable, in contrast to the oxygen-p interaction discussed earlier.14 The carboxylate group of PEP actually displaces the side-chain of Tyr235 when it binds (Figure 4(b)). In the ligand-free structure, Tyr235's hydroxyl group accepts a hydrogen bond from the side-chain amide group of Asn403. In the PEP-bound structure, the hydrogen bond between Tyr235 and the side-chain of Asn403 is broken and replaced by a hydrogen bond between the Tyr hydroxyl group and the main-chain carbonyl group of Asn403. Aligning the structures of the PEP and GTP comÊ plexes results in a 0.28 A rms deviation in the posa itions of the 603 C atoms. The overall similarity of the structures of the complexes suggests that binding of either substrate could occur ®rst during the reaction. No dramatic conformational change occurs upon binding either GTP or PEP, which blocks access to the unoccupied OAA or GDPbinding sites. Substrate-free enyzme The structure of the ligand-free human enzyme is very similar to the structures of the complexes. As was the case for the PEP complex, the unliganded enzyme contains a bound Mn ion and no bound Mg2. After aligning the ligand-free and PEP-bound structures, the rms deviation in the Ê positions of the 603 Ca atoms is only 0.22 A; the Ê if the ligand-free corresponding ®gure is 0.29 A and GTP-bound structures are compared. The large domain motion seen in the E. coli form of the enzyme has not been observed in any of the crystals of the human PEPCK. In the E. coli structures, a 20  rotation of one domain relative to another occurs concomitantly with ATP binding, yielding a more compact form of the enzyme which resembles the human enzyme structures. The possibility that crystal packing induces such a domain motion in the human enzyme cannot be ruled out, but it is nonetheless clear that the enzyme can adopt a compact conformation in the absence of bound substrates or products. The reactive cysteine residue identi®ed in biochemical experiments as Cys288 can be seen in Figure 3(c). The sulfhydryl group is not exposed to solvent in the GTP-bound complex, consistent with the biochemical data showing that nucleotides protect Cys288 from modi®cation.13,15 The Cys288 sulfhydryl group is more exposed to solvent in the substrate-free structure, with a water Ê molecule within 2.8 A of the sulfur atom. In the structure with no substrate bound, residues 286 290 of the P loop display increased mobility, as evidenced by their higher B-factors, and movements of main-chain atoms of the loop allow solvent to gain access to the sulfhydryl group of Cys288. Binding of GTP simultaneously expels the water molecule and reduces the mobility of the P-loop. Given that the Cys288 side-chain is buried when GTP is bound, it seems likely that

GTP-dependent PEPCK Structure

modi®cation of Cys288 prevents the P-loop from adopting the conformation required for productive GTP binding. The conformation of the Ploop is known to be critical for high-af®nity binding of nucleotides in another well-studied system. The GTP-bound form of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) ferries charged tRNAs to the ribosome during protein synthesis, and hydrolyzes the GTP to GDP as the aminoacyl-tRNA is released to the ribosomal A-site. Slow release of GDP would be detrimental to the recycling of EF-Tu during protein synthesis, and another elongation factor, EF-Ts, binds to the EF-Tu ÁGDP complex and stimulates GDP release. Structures of EF-Tu bound to EF-Ts show that EF-Ts lowers the af®nity of EF-Tu for GDP by altering the conformation of the P-loop.16,17 In the case of PEPCK, the conformation of the P-loop compatible with GTP binding in a productive mode buries the Cys288 side-chain in an environment shielded from solvent. Modi®cation of Cys288 can occur only when the P-loop explores other conformations that expose the Cys288 sulfhydryl group, such as that observed in the substratefree structure.

Discussion
In summary, the structures reported here provide the ®rst glimpse of a novel GTP-binding site, unique to the GTP-dependent PEPCK family. The guanine-binding pocket is an attractive target for inhibition by small molecules, given the opportunities for forming a number of hydrogen bonds in an otherwise hydrophobic environment shielded from water. The completion of the human genome sequence has yielded a vast number of potential targets for the pharmaceutical industry, and choosing among them is not an easy task. X-ray crystallography can help in the prioritization process by identifying proteins with suitable binding sites for small molecules, and by giving an indication of how dif®cult it will be to achieve speci®c inhibition of the desired target. By those criteria, PEPCK with its unique GTP-binding site is an attractive target for further work. Given that PEPCK catalyzes the rate-limiting step of gluconeogenesis, inhibition of the enzyme should result in reduced glucose production by the liver. Development of a PEPCK inhibitor may lead to a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of type II diabetes.

Materials and Methods
Structure determination Recombinant human, cytosolic PEPCK was expressed as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in E. coli. The GST-PEPCK fusion protein was puri®ed by af®nity chromatography using glutathioneSepharose 4B (Pharmacia) according to the protocol supplied by Pharmacia. The GST-tag was removed by cleavage with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. The

GTP-dependent PEPCK Structure digestion mixture consisted of 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mg/ml of GST-PEPCK, and 167 units of TEV per mg of protein. The digestion proceeded for 48 hours at 4  C. Undigested GST-PEPCK and free GST were removed by af®nity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The TEV protease was removed by af®nity chromatography with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). The unbound material was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 (HR26/20) column (Pharmacia). The protein was eluted in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT. The TEV digestion left three residues (GEL) from the expression construct fused to the N terminus of PEPCK. Mass spectrometry yielded a molecular mass of 69,448 daltons for the recombinant protein after removal of the GST tag. DNA sequencing was performed to reconcile the difference between the observed molecular mass and that predicted from the sequence in the Swiss-Prot data bank. Sequencing indicates there are three differences between our sequence and the Swiss-Prot data bank entry P35558: Ile267Val, Glu586Asp, and Glu597Val. Crystals of native and selenomethionyl-substituted protein were grown at 16  C via vapor diffusion in hanging drops with PEG1500 as precipitant. The space Ê Ê group is P1 with cell edges a  45.39 A, b  60.54 A, Ê c  61.83 A and angles a  88.36  , b  70.39  , g  72.36  . Crystals were frozen for data collection after transfer to a cryoprotectant consisting of 15 % (v/v) ethylene glycol, 25 % (w/v) PEG1500, 0.1 M Mes (pH 6). X-ray diffraction data sets were reduced with the HKL software package.18 The structure of the complex between PEPCK and the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, b,g-methylene GTP, was solved by MAD phasing with data collected at three wavelengths around the Se edge. Se sites were identi®ed using direct methods as implemented in the CCP4 version of RANTAN.19,20 Phases were calculated with SHARP21 and a model built into the electron density map with O.22 Representative electron density is shown in Figure 1. The model includes 603 of the 622 amino acid residues of PEPCK, the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, and two metal ions. Nine residues at the N terminus and ten residues in two ¯exible loops at the protein surface were not visible in the electron density. One residue (Met500) was modeled with alternate conformations to account for two distinct Se sites. Re®nement against the MAD data collected at the high-energy remote wavelength was performed using REFMAC,23 with 5 % of the data ¯agged for calculation of the free R-factor. A crystal grown from Ê native protein yielded a high-resolution 1.85 A data set for the b,g-methylene GTP complex. In the highresolution GTP-bound structure, what appears to be an acetate ion occupies the PEP site and displaces the solvent coordinating the Mn ion. The substrate-free and PEP complex structures were solved using the GTP-bound form as a starting model. Statistical indicators of data and model quality are given in Table 1. The Figures were prepared with the Ribbons program.24 Coordinate entries for the structures described here are 1KHB, 1KHE, 1KHF, and 1KHG. Binding of nucleotides Calorimetric measurements were carried out at 25  C by titration of 40 mM GST-PEPCK with 270 mM nucleotide in an argon-purged buffer consisting of 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.45), 100 mM KCl, 10 % (v/v) dimethylsulf-

263
oxide, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.075 mM MnSO4, 1 mM DTT. Binding constants were determined by the ®tting routines provided by MicroCal. For XTP, measurements were performed at both 15  C and 25  C, and no evidence of binding was observed at either temperature.
