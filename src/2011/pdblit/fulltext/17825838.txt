Structural Switch of the g Subunit in an Archaeal aIF2ag Heterodimer
Laure Yatime,1 Yves Mechulam,1 Sylvain Blanquet,1 and Emmanuelle Schmitt1,* 1 Laboratoire de Biochimie ´ Unite Mixte de Recherche 7654 CNRS-Ecole Polytechnique F-91128 Palaiseau cedex France A site. There, once correct pairing between the anticodon of the tRNA and the codon on the mRNA has been checked, GTP is hydrolyzed. EF1A:GDP releases the correct tRNA in the A site and dissociates from the ribosome. EF1A:GDP is further recycled to its GTP bound form through complex formation with the nucleotide exchange factor EF1B. EF1A is composed of three domains. The G domain, domain I, is responsible for binding of the nucleotide. Domains II and III are b barrels. In all known structures, domains II and III are in the same relative orientation and are therefore considered as a single structural unit. Two flexible regions in EF1A (called ``switch regions'') govern the transition from an active GTP bound state to an inactive GDP bound state. In the active form of EF1A, the G domain is packed onto domains II and III (closed conformation), and the switch regions adopt a conformation termed ``switch on.'' In the inactive form, there are no contacts between the G domain and domain II, and a large hole is present in the middle of the molecule between all three domains (open conformation). The switch regions adopt a conformation termed ``switch off'' (Abel et al., 1996; Berchtold et al., 1993; Jurnak, 1985; Kjeldgaard et al., 1993; Nissen et al., 1995; Polekhina et al., 1996; Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001). e/aIF2 is a complex of three subunits, a, b, and g (Barrieux and Rosenfeld, 1977). The g subunit forms the core of the heterotrimer (Flynn et al., 1993; Nika et al., 2001; Schmitt et al., 2002; Thompson et al., 2000). It makes contacts with both the a and the b proteins. In the trimer, the a and b subunits do not interact. The structures of aIF2g from Pyroccoccus abyssi (Pa-aIF2g; Schmitt et al., 2002) and Methanococcus jannaschii (Mj-aIF2g; Roll-Mecak et al., 2004) have been solved. aIF2g is made of three domains, which will be noted with roman numerals. Domain I (G domain) contains the nucleotide binding site. Domains II and III are b barrels. The domain arrangement in aIF2g is very similar to the closed conformation of EF1A, encountered in the active, GTP bound form, complexed with aminoacylated tRNA. However, the conformation of the switch regions is in the ``off'' state, and the position of the G domain in Pa-aIF2g differs from that of EF1A by a 14º rotation (Schmitt et al., 2002). Superimposition of domains II and III of an EF1A: GTP:Phe-tRNAPhe complex on the corresponding domains in Pa-aIF2g:Gpp(NH)p enabled us to position Phe-tRNAPhe on the surface of the archaeal initiation factor. This docking leads to few atomic clashes (Schmitt et al., 2002). Nucleotide binding in native Pa-aIF2g crystals was studied by soaking with GDP-Mg2+, GTP-Mg2+, or Gpp(NH)p-Mg2+ solutions. Crystals were also obtained by seeding Pa-aIF2g solutions containing one of the above-described nucleotide with microcrystals of the apo form of aIF2g (Schmitt et al., 2002). Only subtle conformational changes were observed when comparing the GDP and GTP bound forms to the free factor. In particular, the conformation of the two switch regions did not change, but remained in the ``off'' state. This result renders the well-established GTP dependence of aIF2

Summary Eukaryotic and archaeal initiation factors 2 (e/aIF2) are heterotrimeric proteins (abg) supplying the small subunit of the ribosome with methionylated initiator tRNA. This study reports the crystallographic structure of an aIF2ag heterodimer from Sulfolobus solfataricus bound to Gpp(NH)p-Mg2+. aIF2g is in a closed conformation with the G domain packed on domains II and III. The C-terminal domain of aIF2a interacts with domain II of aIF2g. Conformations of the two switch regions involved in GTP binding are similar to those encountered in an EF1A:GTP:Phe-tRNAPhe complex. Comparison with the EF1A structure suggests that only the g subunit of the aIF2ag heterodimer contacts tRNA. Because the a subunit markedly reinforces the affinity of tRNA for the g subunit, a contribution of the a subunit to the switch movements observed in the g structure is considered. Introduction In eukaryotes and archaea, the heterotrimeric e/aIF2 factor plays a key role in the initiation of protein biosynthesis. In its GTP bound form, e/aIF2 delivers methionylated initiator tRNA to the small subunit of the ribosome (Barrieux and Rosenfeld, 1977; Picciano et al., 1973; for reviews, see Kapp and Lorsch, 2004b; Merrick and Hershey, 1996; Pestova et al., 2001; Sonenberg and Dever, 2003; Trachsel, 1996). After the correct pairing between the AUG initiation codon on mRNA and the CAU anticodon of the initiator tRNA has been assessed, GTP is hydrolyzed and e/aIF2:GDP is released from the ribosome (Huang et al., 1997; Unbehaun et al., 2004). In eukaryotes, eIF2:GDP is regenerated through the action of a heteropentameric guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. Archaea have no equivalent of eIF2B, and the exchange between GDP and GTP is thought to be spontaneous (Kyrpides and Woese, 1998). Therefore, the hydrolysis of GTP on e/aIF2 controls stringent selection of the initiation codon (Huang et al., 1997). More generally, guanine nucleotide binding proteins are essential components for the control of the accuracy of the translational process. Extensive studies of the elongation factor EF1A have shown how each conformational state of the protein is governed by its nucleotide ligand. EF1A:GTP:aa-tRNA complexes carrying a cognate or a noncognate tRNA are directed to the ribosomal

in tRNA binding difficult to explain (Schmitt et al., 2002; Trachsel, 1996; Yatime et al., 2004). Recent studies show that the presence of the aIF2a subunit strongly reinforces the affinity of aIF2g for Met-tRNAiMet (Yatime et al., 2004; Pedulla et al., 2005). aIF2a is made of three domains (aIF2a domains will be noted with arabic numerals). Domains 1 and 2 form a rigid body linked to a mobile third domain (Ito et al., 2004; Yatime et al., 2005). This third domain (aD3) enables the binding of aIF2a to aIF2g, as shown by native gel electrophoresis and molecular sieving experiments. Moreover, it gives an aD3g heterodimer full tRNA binding capacity, identical to that measured with the intact aIF2 heterotrimer (Yatime et al., 2004). In this study, we report the crystallographic structure of an aIF2ag heterodimer from Sulfolobus solfataricus (Ss-aIF2ag) bound to Gpp(NH)p-Mg2+. In the heterodimer, aIF2g is in a closed conformation, and its G domain is packed on domains II and III. Domain 3 of aIF2a is bound to domain II of aIF2g. Conformations of the two switch regions involved in the nucleotide binding are identical to those encountered in an EF1A:GTP: Phe-tRNAPhe complex. Comparison of the EF1A structure with that of the aIF2ag heterodimer enables us to easily dock tRNA onto the g subunit. With this docking, the a subunit does not establish contacts with the tRNA. On the other hand, we observe that the a subunit markedly reinforces the affinity of the tRNA for the g subunit. To explain this behavior, a contribution of the a subunit to the switch movements observed in the Gpp(NH)pMg2+ bound g structure is considered. Results and Discussion Domain Arrangement of a and g Proteins in the ag Heterodimer Crystals containing aIF2a and aIF2g:Gpp(NH)p were obtained by using PEG 6000 as a precipitating agent. They ° belong to space group P212121 and diffract to 3.0 A resolution. A molecular replacement solution was obtained with PHASER by using the 3D model of Pa-aIF2g. The quality of the electron density map was sufficient to rebuild the model corresponding to the Sulfolobus solfataricus g subunit (Ss-aIF2g) and to detect the position of the C-terminal domain of Ss-aIF2a (domain 3). During refinement, the quality of the electron density improved, and domains 1 and 2 of Ss-aIF2a were built. The model ° was refined at 3.0 A resolution with an R factor of 22.4% (Rfree = 29.1%, Table 1). The final model comprises the entire Ss-aIF2g subunit (with the exception of residues g36­g43 and g262­g266) and the entire Ss-aIF2a subunit (residues a48­a52 are not visible). The overall domain organization of the Ss-aIF2g subunit is similar to that of Pa-aIF2g and Mj-aIF2g (RollMecak et al., 2004; Schmitt et al., 2002); the G domain (domain I) is packed onto domains II and III (Figure 1A). As in Pa-aIF2g and Mj-aIF2g, a four-cysteine cluster (gC59, gC62, gC74, gC77) forms a zinc binding knuckle protruding outside of the G domain. The three structural domains of the e/aIF2a subunit are found in the asymmetric unit. Domain 1 is a b barrel, domain 2 is an a helix, and domain 3 possesses a babbab fold (Figure 1A). Each isolated domain can be superimposed on the corresponding domain in Pa-aIF2a (Yatime

et al., 2005). As previously observed, the orientation of domain 1 with respect to domain 2 is similar to that of other e/aIF2a structures (Dhaliwal and Hoffman, 2003; Ito et al., 2004; Nonato et al., 2002; Yatime et al., 2005). However, when the structure of Ss-aIF2a is superimposed on that of Pa-aIF2a, a rotation of domain 3 by nearly 180º around the N-Ca174-Ca175-N dihedral angle is observed. This may reflect a mobility of domains 1 and 2 with respect to domain 3 in e/aIF2a, as already discussed (Ito et al., 2004; Yatime et al., 2005). The C-Terminal Domain of aIF2a Interacts with Domain II of aIF2g Overall, the aIF2ag heterodimer has an extended shape. The a and g molecules are held together by a single region of contact. The anchoring region involves domain II of Ss-aIF2g and domain 3 of Ss-aIF2a (Figure 1A). The ° surface of contact is 1700 A2. As shown in Figure 1B, two loops of Ss-aIF2a domain 3 (aL1, between b6 and a6, and aL2, between b7 and b8; Figure 2B) are buried in two pockets at the surface of Ss-aIF2g domain II (Figure 1B). One of these pockets is bordered by the long, protruding gL1 loop. The second pocket is bordered by b11. The small aA helix is at the hinge between the two pockets (Figure 1C). Main chain interactions between the gL1 loop and Ss-aIF2a involve gG227 and gT228, which both interact with aT221, and gF230, which interacts with aI219 (Figures 1C and 2). Moreover, gF230 is stacked on aI200, and the side chain of gL233 makes van der Waals contacts with both the side chain of aT221 and that of the strictly conserved residue aY227. Also, the NH group of gL233 interacts with N3 of aK197. Notably, in the e/aIF2a sequences, a K or an R residue is systematically encountered at this position. In the second pocket, the carbonyl group of gY300 interacts with the amide group of aV193, and the side chain of gD302 interacts with the NH group of aT187. The acidic character of the residue found at the position of gD302 is

In the Ss-aIF2g subunit, the three structural domains are colored as follows: G domain (residues 1­210) in green, domain II (residues 211­320) in yellow, and domain III (residues 321­415) in orange. The zinc ion is represented as a green sphere. The Gpp(NH)p molecule is drawn in yellow sticks, and the Mg ion is drawn as a yellow sphere. In SsaIF2a, the three structural domains are colored as follows: domain 1 (residues 1­85) in dark blue, domain 2 (residues 86­175) in marine, and domain 3 (residues 176­266) in cyan. Secondary structure elements are labeled according to the numbering used for the Pa-aIF2a and Pa-aIF2g structures (Schmitt et al., 2002; Yatime et al., 2005). The gL1 loop involved in the binding of aIF2a is indicated by an arrow. (B) Close-up view of the interface region between aIF2a and aIF2g. Domain 3 of aIF2a is drawn as a cyan cartoon.

systematically conserved in all available e/aIF2g sequences (Figure 2A). The gL1 loop corresponds to an idiosyncratic region, specific to the initiation factors and not found in elongation factors (Schmitt et al., 2002). Its involvement in the binding of the aIF2a subunit was previously established by using a truncated mutant of Pa-aIF2g (Yatime et al., 2005). The gDL1 mutant, resulting from the replacement of residues 222­228 of Pa-aIF2g loop 1 by a glycine, no longer binds the a subunit, but it retains the capacity to bind the b subunit (Yatime et al., 2004). Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis experiments with Mj-aIF2g showed that aIF2g-L256D (corresponding to gL233 in Ss-aIF2g) and aIF2g-D325A (corresponding to gD302 in Su-aIF2g) exhibited dramatic reductions in their aIF2a binding capacities (Roll-Mecak et al., 2004 and Figure 2A). Therefore, the present structure convincingly

explains the behavior of all of these mutants as well as the crucial role of the specific gL1 loop in the binding of e/aIF2a to e/aIF2g. The conformation of the gL1 loop in Ss-aIF2g is similar to that observed in Mj-aIF2g (Roll-Mecak et al., 2004). Moreover, domain II has the same main chain conformation in all three known aIF2g structures (domains II and III of Pa-aIF2g and Mj-aIF2g can be superimposed on the corresponding domains in Ss-aIF2g with an identical ° rmsd of 1.17 A, for 177 compared C-a atoms). Domains 3 of Pa-aIF2a and Ss-aIF2a are also similar (Table 2). Altogether, these comparisons suggest that the docking pocket on aIF2g is preformed for aIF2a.

The alignment shown is deduced from a multiple sequence alignment with 50 eukaryotic eIF2g sequences, 22 archaeal aIF2g sequences, and 97 EF1A sequences from the 3 life domains. Strictly conserved residues (defined as displaying no more than four exceptions) in e/aIF2g and EF1A sequences are colored in cyan. Strictly conserved residues (no more than four exceptions) in e/aIF2g are colored in red. Positions with conservative replacements (residues of the same family with no more than four exceptions) are in green. Conservation families are as follows: hydrophobic (A, V, I, L, M, F, and C), aromatic (W, Y, and F), basic (R and K), acidic (D and E), small (G and A), and hydroxyl groups (S and T). For the sake of clarity, the N-terminal sequence of Mj-aIF2g has been truncated until residue 27. Methionine 1 of EF1A is omitted. The numberings and the secondary structure elements of Ss-aIF2g and Thermus thermophilus EF1A are schematized below the sequences. Dots symbolize undefined regions in the electronic density. Red dots show residues involved in tRNA binding according to site-directed mutagenesis experiments (see text and Figure 4B). Green triangles designate residues involved in the binding of aIF2a.

Strictly conserved residues are in red (no more than 4 exceptions out of the 66 analyzed sequences). Positions with conservative replacements are in green. Conservation families are the same as those described above. The numbering and the secondary structure elements of Ss-aIF2a are schematized at the bottom of the sequence. Dots below the sequence indicate an undefined region in the electronic density. Green triangles correspond to residues involved in the binding of aIF2g.

metal ion are well defined in the electron density of the Ss-aIF2ag heterodimer. Similar to all G proteins, the nucleotide binding pocket is formed by the 184SALH187 and 149NKxD152 motifs, which surround the nucleotide ring, and by the 21GKT23 loop, which interacts with the phosphate moiety (Figure 3A). Two supplementary regions are involved in the nucleotide binding. These are mobile regions, called switch 1 and switch 2. They display various conformations according to the nucleotide bound.

The Mg2+ ion coordinates five oxygen ligands from the Ss-aIF2g:Gpp(NH)p complex in a square pyramidal geometry (Figure 3B). In the equatorial plane, there are two oxygens from the b and g phosphates and two oxygens from the side chains of gT23 (GKT motif) and gT46 (switch 1). In an apical position, one water molecule is bound to the magnesium ion. This water molecule is also held by the side chain of gD93 and the carbonyl group of gA94 (93DAPGH97, switch 2 loop; Figure 3A).

The conformations of the switch regions in SsaIF2g:Gpp(NH)p can be compared to those observed in Pa-aIF2g complexed with GDP (Figures 3A and 3C; Schmitt et al., 2002). Upon transition from the GDP to the Gpp(NH)p form, the switch 2 helix (a2) is displaced. Compared to Pa-aIF2g:GDP, the position of a2 in SsaIF2g:Gpp(NH)p is shifted by three residues with

respect to the amino acid sequence (a2 from Ss-aIF2g, a2 from Pa-aIF2g, 94EALMTTML101; Figures 2A and 3A). Such a translation of helix a2 along the sequence was also observed in EF1A (Berchtold et al., 1993; Kjeldgaard et al., 1993). In the Ss-aIF2g structure, unwinding of the N-terminal part of a2 extends the loop preceding a2, therefore allowing interaction of gD93 and gA94 with the magnesium ion, as well as interaction of gG96 with the g phosphate. In addition, the switch 1 loop, which is far from the nucleotide in Pa-aIF2g:GDP, flips toward Gpp(NH)p in Ss-aIF2g, allowing gT46 to interact with the magnesium ion (Figures 3A and 3C). Finally, the conformations of the two switch regions involved in the binding of the Gpp(NH)p molecule in Ss-aIF2ag are similar to those described in the EF1A:Gpp(NH)p and EF1A:Gpp(NH)p:tRNA complexes (Berchtold et al., 1993; Kjeldgaard et al., 1993; Nissen et al., 1995; Figure 3C, left and middle-left views). In switch 1, the counterpart of helix A00 of EF1A is not visible in the electron density of Ss-aIF2ag:Gpp(NH)p (residues

For the sake of clarity, only domain I of Pa-aIF2g:GDP is shown as a slate-blue cartoon. The Gpp(NH)p molecule bound to Ss-aIF2ag is drawn as a stick.

The movement of the switch 1 loop from the GDP state (Pa-aIF2g:GDP structure) to the Gpp (NH)p state (Ss-aIF2ag:Gpp(NH)p structure) is underlined with an arrow. This arrow illustrates how the movement of the switch region opens the channel between domains I and II, therefore favoring tRNA binding.

Domain 1 of Ss-aIF2g was used as the reference. In all four panels, switch 1 is colored in orange, switch 2 is colored in red, and the region that links switch 1 to switch 2 is colored in green. The bound nucleotides are drawn as sticks. The positions of the crucial residues corresponding to the conserved threonine of switch 1 and to the conserved aspartate of switch 2 are shown. Magnesium and zinc ions are drawn with green spheres. Left view: Switch regions of Ss-aIF2ag:Gpp(NH)p. Middle-left view: Switch regions of EF1A:Gpp(NH)p:tRNA. Middle-right view: Switch regions of Pa-aIF2g:Gpp(NH)p. Right view: Switch regions of Pa-aIF2g:GDP. Note the limited movements of the switch regions observed in the case of Pa-aIF2g crystals soaked either in Gpp(NH)p or GDP nucleotide solutions. The most affected region corresponds to the loop of switch 2, which, upon binding of Gpp(NH)p, is displaced in such a way that D90 no longer interacts with the magnesium ion (Schmitt et al., 2002).

g36­g43; Figures 2 and 3C). In EF1A, this part of the effector region interacts with the tRNA moiety, but it also interacts with the magnesium ion via a water molecule. Indeed, in T. thermophilus EF1A, residue D51 forms a hydrogen bond with a second apical water coordinating the magnesium ion (Nissen et al., 1995). This interaction does not exist in Ss-aIF2ag:Gpp(NH)p, and no other water molecule is seen in the electron density map. Therefore, the octahedral coordination of the metal observed in the available EF1A:GTP complexes (Nissen et al., 1995; Berchtold et al., 1993; Kjeldgaard et al., 1993) appears as a square pyramidal one in Ss-aIF2ag: Gpp(NH)p. In EF1A, the A0 and A00 helices participate in the binding of an aminoacylated elongator tRNA molecule (Nissen et al., 1999). The absence of Met-tRNAiMet in our aIF2ag:Gpp(NH)p structure may explain why the A00 helix could not adopt a stable conformation. One can imagine that, upon tRNA binding, S36 of aIF2g plays a role similar to that of D51 in EF1A (Figure 2) and stabilizes the octahedral coordination of the magnesium ion. aIF2a Plays a Crucial Role in the Binding of Methionylated Initiator tRNA Dissociation constants of Met-tRNAiMet from an aIF2: Gpp(NH)p:Met-tRNAiMet complex can be estimated by following deacylation rates in the presence of various aIF2 concentrations at a fixed tRNA concentration (Yatime et al., 2004). This approach was used to measure equilibrium constants (Kd) for the P. abyssi Met-RNAiMet: Pa-aIF2 complex (90 6 30 nM; (Yatime et al., 2004). Very similar constants were obtained with E. coli MettRNAfMet (120 6 30 nM; Yatime et al., 2004), which is a close homolog of P. abyssi Met-tRNAiMet. Here, because initiator tRNA from S. solfataricus is very close to both P. abyssi and E. coli initiator tRNA, we used the bacterial tRNA to characterize complex formation with Ss-aIF2. Using heterotrimeric Ss-aIF2, a Kd value of E. coli MettRNAfMet of 1.5 6 0.5 nM was measured at 51ºC (Table 3, row 1). With the Ss-aIF2ag heterodimer, the binding affinity was of the same order of magnitude (7.5 6 1.0 nM, Table 3, row 3). Using Ss-aIF2g alone, no protection of Met-tRNAfMet against deacylation was observed (Table 3, row 2, Kd > 100 mM). These results agree with those of Pedulla et al. (2005). Nevertheless, the lack of protection of Met-tRNAfMet against deacylation by isolated Ss-aIF2g remains intriguing. Indeed, with Pa-aIF2g, a protection was observed and a Kd value of 5 6 3 mM was measured at 51ºC (Yatime et al., 2004). Possibly, this difference reflects the different conditions of growth of these two organisms (Cohen et al., 2003; Zillig et al., 1994). Finally, a C-terminal domain of Ss-aIF2a (Ss-aD3) was added to Ss-aIF2g. The resulting heterodimer bound Met-tRNAfMet with an affinity identical to that measured with intact Ss-aIF2ag (Table 3, row 5). Therefore, in agreement with the results previously obtained with Pa-aIF2 (Yatime et al., 2004), domain 3 of Ss-aIF2a is sufficient to confer on aIF2g full tRNA binding ability. Docking of Met-tRNAiMet onto the aIF2ag:Gpp(NH)p Heterodimer Because of the movements of the switch regions, SsaIF2g in the ag heterodimer is closer to EF1A complexed with Gpp(NH)p and tRNA than Pa- or Mj-aIF2g are.

The shown values are derived from plots of the deacylation rate as a function of the concentration of aIF2 variants. Experiments were performed at 51ºC in the presence of 2 nM Met-tRNAfMet, the E. coli initiator tRNA, and of the indicated nucleotide (1 mM).

global superimposition of Ss-aIF2g on EF1A:Gpp(NH)p: ° tRNA, the rmsd is 1.64 A for 302 Ca atoms (148 Ca atoms from domain I, 80 from domain II, and 74 from domain III). Upon superimposition of either Pa- or Mj-aIF2g on ° EF1A:Gpp(NH)p:tRNA, rmsd values of 1.95 A each are obtained (for 253 Ca atoms). Actually, in the Ss-aIF2ag structure, the movement of switch 1 opens a channel that allows the 30 -aminoacylated end of tRNA to dip within the putative methionine binding pocket (Figure 3A). From the superimposition of the EF1A:Gpp(NH)p:tRNA structure on that of the Ss-aIF2ag heterodimer, a tight docking of Met-tRNAiMet was deduced (Figure 4). The model obtained indicates binding of the terminal A76 base in a pocket formed by strands b11 and b14, at the surface of domain II of e/aIF2g. The methionyl moiety esterified to tRNA is accommodated in a cleft formed by b7, b8, and b14 of domain II on the one side and by the switch 1 region on the other side (Figures 3A and 4). We could achieve this docking without any movement of domains II and III with respect to domain I. The obtained docking solution explains the effects of mutations altering the tRNA binding capacity of the g subunit of yeast (Y142H, [Erickson et al., 1997]; R319D, G397A, [Roll-Mecak et al., 2004]; R510H, [Dorris et al., 1995]) and of the g subunit of P. abyssi (G236D, [Schmitt et al., 2002]; for all proteins, the amino acid numbering starts at Met1). Equivalent residues in Ss-aIF2g are gY51, gR219, gG239, gA296, and gR406. In our Ss model, gY51 belonging to switch 1 is stacked against the aminoacyl moiety and would play an equivalent role to that of H76 in EF1A:Gpp(NH)p:tRNA. Residues gR219 (b7), gG239 (b8), and gA296 (b14) contribute to the binding of the amino acid moiety and to that of the terminal adenosine. These residues correspond to D227, T239, and G287 in EF1A (Figure 2; Nissen et al., 1995). R406 in domain III is predicted to contact the T stem of the tRNA (Figure 4). In the Ss-aIF2ag structure, the side chains of gY51, gR219, and gF221 (b7) adopt positions different from those observed in the Pa- and Mj-aIF2g structures. These new positions are likely to result from motions of the switch regions. They may reflect the reshaping of the tRNA binding site inside the ag heterodimer. Role of Domain 3 of aIF2a in tRNA Binding Domain 3 of the a subunit is required to give aIF2 its full tRNA binding affinity (Pedulla et al., 2005; Yatime et al.,

Figure 4. Docking of Phe-tRNAPhe onto the Ss-aIF2ag Heterodimer The docking model was directly deduced from superimposition of the entire Ss-aIF2g molecule on the entire EF1A:Phe-tRNAPhe complex (PDB ID: 1TTT). The docking did not require any adjustment. (A) Surface representation of the Ss-aIF2ag heterodimer; basic residues are drawn in blue, and acidic residues are drawn in red. The tRNA molecule is drawn as a stick. (B) A transparent molecular surface of the Ss-aIF2ag heterodimer is represented. Cartoons of the model are visible by transparency. The color code is the same as that used in Figure 1: g domain I is in green, g domain II is in yellow, g domain III is in orange, a domain 3 is in cyan, and a domain 2 is in marine. The surface of the Gpp(NH)p molecule is in white. The position of gL1 is indicated. Residues important for tRNA recognition, as discussed in the text, are drawn as sticks and are labeled.

2004; this study). This property may indicate some contact between the a subunit and the tRNA ligand. Indeed, in gel shift experiments, an isolated domain 3 of PaaIF2a was shown to weakly bind RNA, though in a nonspecific manner, since both tRNA and rRNA binding were detected (Yatime et al., 2004). However, NMR titration experiments of a 15N-labeled human eIF2a domain 3 with free tRNAiMet did not detect any interaction between these molecules (Ito et al., 2004). The above-described docking model does not enable us to propose a contact between the a subunit and the tRNA molecule (Figure 4B). Therefore, other hypotheses have to be examined to explain the role of domain 3 in tRNA binding: (1) upon tRNA binding to aIF2g, further

conformational changes result in contacts between the polynucleotide and the a subunit; (2) the participation of aIF2a in tRNA affinity is indirect. To assess the first hypothesis, we searched for residues close to the interface between a and g. At the surface of Ss-aIF2a domain 3, two basic residues, aR186 and aR226, point toward the tRNA binding site. They might interact with the polyphosphate chain of tRNA, in the case in which a movement of domain 3 would follow tRNA binding. We prepared mutated aIF2a proteins (aR186A and aR226A) and assembled them with native Ss-aIF2g. The resulting mutated heterodimers were tested for their ability to protect Met-tRNAfMet from spontaneaous deacylation. aIF2agR186A binds MettRNAfMet with an affinity equivalent to that measured for the wild-type heterodimer (Table 3, row 6). The binding affinity of aIF2agR226A to Met-tRNAfMet was lowered by a factor of only 3 (Table 3, row 7). Although significant, this effect is not sufficient to guarantee direct involvement of aR226 in tRNA binding. Finally, it should be underlined that large conformational changes to allow interaction between aIF2a and tRNA would require a large distortion of the a/g interface. Such a distortion seems unlikely, given the apparent rigidity of this interface. Two other aIF2g structures are available. That of PaaIF2g was obtained free or complexed to Gpp(NH)p or to GDP. The structure of Mj-aIF2g was solved in the apo form. In all of these structures, closed domain conformations were systematically observed, making it unlikely that these conformations are due to lattice packing effects (Roll-Mecak et al., 2004). In the case of Pa-aIF2g, only a few conformational changes were observed between the GDP and Gpp(NH)p forms. In particular, the switch regions have the same structure in the two nucleotidic forms (Figure 3C, middle-right and right views; Schmitt et al., 2002). Here, the 3D structure of the Ss factor is the first one in which the switch regions of aIF2g occupy conformations similar to those observed in EF1A:Gpp(NH)p (Figure 3). Possibly, these conformations are related to cocrystallization in the presence of Gpp(NH)p. Indeed, in the case of Pa-aIF2g, nucleotide binding was studied from soaked or seeded crystals (Schmitt et al., 2002), and conformational changes may have been hindered by the crystal lattice. A second possibility is that the presence of the aIF2a subunit helps aIF2g to reach and maintain the switch conformations induced by the presence of Gpp(NH)p. This idea sustains the hypothesis of an indirect effect of aIF2a on the affinity of the tRNA molecule for the g factor. Mutation of aY227 into alanine does not impair the formation of an ag heterodimer. However, it lowers the binding affinity of aIF2aY227Ag for Met-tRNAfMet by a factor of 3 (Table 3, row 8). Y227 is involved in a van der Waals interaction with gL233. Therefore, a slight perturbation at the aIF2ag interface has moderate, but significant, effects on tRNA binding affinity. In this view, the behavior of the Pa-gDL1 mutant can also be recalled (Yatime et al., 2004). In this mutant, residues Pa-g222 to Pag228 of loop 1 are replaced by a glycine. The mutant no longer binds the a subunit. Moreover, it no longer interacts with Met-tRNAiMet. Possibly, this behavior reflects a reciprocal link between the aIF2a binding site and the acquisition of a productive tRNA binding

Structure 126

conformation in aIF2g. In this view, it is notable that the affinity of GTP (but not of GDP) is slightly higher for the Ss-aIF2 heterotrimer compared to the isolated Ss-aIF2g subunit (Pedulla et al., 2005). To fully assess the mechanism of action of e/aIF2a in tRNA binding, further structural studies involving e/aIF2:Met-tRNAiMet complexes are required. At the present stage, the strong similarity between the tertiary structure of Ss-aIF2g:Gpp(NH)p and the EF1A ternary complex favors the idea of an interaction of tRNA with the g subunit only.

The Open Conformation of e/aIF2 Is Not Observed In yeast, the eIF2:Met-tRNAiMet binding affinity is 20 times larger in the presence of GTP than GDP. The GTP bound state was proposed to allow positive interactions with the methionine moiety of Met-tRNAiMet, whereas the binding site corresponding to the body of the tRNA was supposed to remain identical between the two nucleotidic states (Kapp and Lorsch, 2004a). In S. solfataricus, the aIF2ag:Met-tRNAiMet binding affinity is 80 times larger in the presence of GTP than GDP (Table 3, rows 3 and 4). In agreement with the abovementioned idea, we show that, in the Ss heterodimer, formation of a precise tRNA site may result from the movements of the switch regions. Although comparison of Ss-aIF2ag:Gpp(NH)p to Pa-aIF2g does not indicate major domain rearrangements, movement of switch 1 creates the methionine binding pocket. This convincingly explains the marked observed GTP dependence of Met-tRNA binding by aIF2. Additionally, from all available structural data regarding e/aIF2, it appears that the switches' conformational changes between the GDP bound (or apo) and GTP bound forms are accompanied by only subtle adjustments between domains. This markedly contrasts with that of EF1A, which undergoes a drastic conformational change upon transition from the GTP to the GDP form (Abel et al., 1996; Berchtold et al., 1993; Kjeldgaard et al., 1993; Polekhina et al., 1996). Such a change in EF1A is postulated to occur throughout all domains of life (Andersen et al., 2003; Vitagliano et al., 2001). Interestingly, the open conformation of EF1A:GDP was systematically observed in ternary complexes containing the nucleotide exchange factor (Andersen et al., 2000; Jeppesen et al., 2005; Kawashima et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1997). Therefore, it remains possible that the open conformation observed in the presence of GDP is mainly related to the presence of this nucleotide exchange factor. Such an idea would explain why an open structure of aIF2 has not been obtained to date. Indeed, archaea are likely devoid of an exchange factor, and nucleotide exchange is believed to occur spontaneously. The marked structural difference between the GDP form of EF1A and that of aIF2g may also suggest distinct mechanisms for the release of these factors from the ribosome. In the case of yeast eIF2, a GTPase-activating factor, eIF5, triggers GTP hydrolysis and, subsequently, the release of eIF2 (Unbehaun et al., 2004). Such a factor does not exist in archaea. Possibly, in archaea, other factors yet to be described, or the small ribosomal subunit itself, are involved in GTP hydrolysis and the subsequent release of aIF2 from the small ribosomal subunit.

Concluding Remark From the structure of the aIF2ag heterodimer it is tempting to make a ribosome docking model. This model can be envisaged by using the position of the P site tRNA deduced from the T. thermophilus 70S ribosome structure (Yusupov et al., 2001). If the aIF2ag heterodimer is docked onto the P site tRNA in an EF1A-like manner, domain 1 of the aIF2a subunit comes close to nucleotide 1473 of helix H44 in the 16S RNA. H44 plays a crucial role in the ribosome function. Indeed, nucleotides 1492 and 1493 of H44 form part of the A site decoding center (Clemons et al., 1999). Furthermore, H44 also forms part of the P site. Domain 1 of aIF2a is a b barrel that has RNA binding properties (Yatime et al., 2004, 2005). Therefore, such a tentative positioning of aIF2ag on the 30S subunit might give an idea as to the manner by which the a subunit participates in the accuracy of start codon selection (Cigan et al., 1989).
Experimental Procedures Expression and Purification of aIF2 Subunits from Sulfolobus solfataricus The genes encoding wild-type a, b, and g subunits of S. solfataricus aIF2 were amplified by PCR and were cloned in a modified version of pET3a. The resulting vectors were introduced in E. coli Rosetta pLacI-RARE cells (Novagen). Cultures (500 ml) were grown in 2xTY medium containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin and 34 mg/ml chloramphenicol. Expression of each subunit was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM when the OD650 reached 1.6. The cultures were then allowed to continue for 6 hr at room temperature. The DNA coding for domain 3 of aIF2a (D3) was obtained by PCR amplification introducing a start codon at position 174. The amplified PCR product was then recloned into a pET3a derivative. Single point mutants of the a subunit were constructed by using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned gene (Stratagene; La Jolla, California). Purification of aIF2 Cultures (500 ml) of cells overproducing each of the three subunits were harvested, mixed in 100 ml buffer A (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM benzamidine) and disrupted by sonication. 100 mM GTP plus 1 mM MgCl2 were added to stabilize the protein factor. After centrifugation, the supernatant was heated for 10 min at 65ºC. After pelleting the nonthermostable proteins by centrifugation, the supernatant was directly loaded onto a S-Hiload column (16 mm 3 20 cm; Amersham) equilibrated in buffer A. The assembled heterotrimer was eluted by applying a step of buffer B (400 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM benzamidine). At this stage, 1 mM GTP plus 1 mM MgCl2 were added to the elution peak. The sample was concentrated to a small volume (<5 ml) and finally loaded onto a Superdex75 column (16 mm 3 60 cm; Amersham) equilibrated in buffer C (200 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM benzamidine). Either 1 mM Gpp(NH)p-Mg2+ or 1 mM GDP-Mg2+ was added to the recovered protein. Routinely, 30 mg purified protein was obtained from the three mixed 500 ml cultures corresponding to each subunit. Purification of aIF2ag: Wild-Type and Mutant The same protocol as that described for aIF2 purification was applied after mixing a 500 ml culture of aIF2g with a 500 ml culture of aIF2a. Purification of aIF2g Overproducing cells corresponding to a 500 ml culture were disrupted by sonication in 50 ml buffer D (500 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM benzamidine). 100 mM GTP plus 1 mM MgCl2 were added to stabilize the protein. After centrifugation, the supernatant was heated for 10 min at 65ºC. After centrifugation, the crude extract was directly loaded onto a Q-Hiload column (16 mm 3 20 cm; Amersham) equilibrated in buffer D. The flowthrough was recovered, and 1 mM GTP plus 1 mM MgCl2 were added. The sample was

then dialyzed against buffer E (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM benzamidine) and then loaded onto a S-Hiload column (16 mm 3 20 cm; Amersham) equilibrated in the same buffer. The sample was eluted with a step of buffer B. 1 mM GTP plus 1 mM MgCl2 were added to the elution peak. The sample was then concentrated to a small volume (<5 ml) and finally loaded onto a Superdex75 column (16 mm 3 60 cm; Amersham) equilibrated in buffer C. Either 1 mM Gpp(NH)p-Mg2+ or 1 mM GDP-Mg2+ was added to the recovered protein . Nearly 5 mg purified protein was obtained.

Protection Assay The protocol for the assay based on protection of Met-tRNAfMet against spontaneous deacylation was essentially as described in Yatime et al. (2004). Briefly, reaction mixtures (150 ml) contained 20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mg/ml BSA (Bovine Serum Albumine; ROCHE), 5% glycerol, 1 mM GDPNP, and 2 nM [35S]-Met-tRNAfMet (10000 dpm per picomole, [35S]-Met from Perkin Elmer). Concentrations of aIF2 or of its variants were varied from 1 nM to 200 nM according to the Kd value to be measured. The mixtures were incubated at 51ºC. To determine the rate constant of deacylation, 25 ml aliquots were withdrawn at various times (5­30 min) and precipitated in 5% TCA in the presence of 80 mg yeast RNA as carrier. In all cases, the deacylation curve as a function of time could be fitted with a single exponential. Rate constants measured at variable protein concentrations were fitted to simple binding curves from which the dissociation constant of the studied protein:tRNA complexes could be deduced with the MC-Fit program (Dardel, 1994).

Crystallization of aIF2ag Initial screening for crystallization conditions of aIF2ag was performed with the sitting drop technique (2 ml drops) by using a TECAN genesis rsp100 robot and commercial screens from Hampton Research. Crystals were grown at 24ºC by using protein at 9 mg/ml in buffer C plus 0.02% NaN3, 1 mM Gpp(NH)p, 1 mM MgCl2. Crystals were obtained within 1 week by using 10% PEG 6000 and 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0). Microseeding was then used to allow for growth of new crystals. Before data collection, these crystals were soaked in a solution containing 10% PEG 6000, 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0), and 20% ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. They were directly flash cooled within a nitrogen gas stream. Native crystals belonged to ° ° space group P212121 with cell parameters of a = 39.6 A, b = 112.9 A, ° and c = 194.1 A. No crystals were obtained when Gpp(NH)p was replaced by GDP.

Structure Determination and Refinement Data corresponding to aIF2ag crystals were collected at 100K by using the synchrotron source at the ESRF (Grenoble, France; ID14eh1 beamline; Table 1). Diffraction images were analyzed with XDS (Kabsch, 1988), and the resulting data were processed with programs of the CCP4 package (CCP4, 1994). The structure of aIF2ag was solved by molecular replacement by using PHASER (Storoni et al., 2004). First, the three domains of aIF2g were searched separately. Domain I, domain II, and domain III were searched successively, in this order, by using the corresponding domains of Pa-aIF2g as models. Three unique solutions (z score = 7.6, z score = 11.6, and z score = 14.1, respectively) were found and were used to calculate an initial map. No matter which structural model was used, no solution was obtained by molecular replacement for the a subunit. The structure of the g subunit was refined by cycles of manual model building and energy minimization with CNS ° (Brunger et al., 1998) by using data between 12 and 3.0 A resolution (2 sigma cutoff). After a few steps of refinement, the density around the g subunit became more organized. This allowed for the positioning of domain 3 of aIF2a from P. abyssi in the density map. A new round of manual model building and energy minimization was then used, and, successively, domain 2 and domain 1 of aIF2a from P. abyssi were positioned in the refined map. A last set of refinement steps led to the final model. The final working and free R factors for aIF2ag were 22.4% and 29.1%, respectively. All residues are within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.
