Multihaem cytochromes play a key role in electron-transport reactions in the periplasm of sulfate- and sulfur-reducing bacteria. The redox proteins grouped in the c3 superfamily also display metal-reducing activities, which make them interesting biotechnological tools. The crystal structure of the fully oxidized cytochrome c7 from Desulfuromonas acetoxidans has been solved by combined molecularreplacement and MAD methods. The structure has been Ê re®ned at 1.9 A resolution to an R value of 19.1% (Rfree = 24.3%) and includes three haems and 116 water molecules. The protein displays the cytochrome c3 fold in a highly minimized form, while haem 2 and the surrounding protein environment are missing. The geometry of haem packing and of the haem axial ligands and propionates are described and compared with that of c3 cytochromes. The crystal structure is compared with the solution structure recently obtained by NMR methods and with its homologue cytochromes of the c3 superfamily. Comparison of the high number of available structures makes it possible to analyze the structural role of the few highly conserved residues, in addition to the cysteines and histidines that link the porphyrin rings and the Fe atoms to the protein chain.

1. Introduction
Cytochrome c7 is known to be the smallest representative of the multihaem cytochrome c3 superfamily (Bruschi, 1994), with 68 amino acids and three haem groups (Ambler, 1971). This class of cytochromes, de®ned by Ambler as type III (Ambler, 1980), was ®rst identi®ed in the 1950s by Postgate (1954) and Ishimoto et al. (1954). A large number of multihaem cytochromes with different haem contents, varying from three to 16 haem groups per polypeptide chain, are currently known. The crystal structures of tetrahaem (Czjzek, Payan, Guerlesquin et al., 1994; Haser, Pierrot et al., 1979; Higuchi et al., 1984, 1994; Matias et al., 1993, 1996; Nùrager et al., 1999), Ä octahaem (Czjzek et al., 1996, Frazao et al., 1999) and nonahaem (Matias et al., 1999) cytochromes c3 demonstrate that these proteins are variants and/or multimers of the tetrahaem cytochrome c3 motif. The recently obtained NMR solution structure of cytochrome c7 (Assfalg et al., 1998) revealed that this cytochrome is no exception and, as has been predicted by sequence alignments, it is the haem 2 and the corresponding protein chain that are missing in this shortest version of cytochromes c3. The main characteristic of these small soluble cytochromes is the bishistidinal axial ligation of all the haem groups in the molecule, which present low, albeit different, redox potentials (between À50 and À400 mV). Although the amino-acid

composition, sequence homology, formal charges and isoelectric points of these cytochromes may be very different, the haem packing geometry is highly conserved in all the proteins studied. The highly conserved core of these redox proteins, consisting of the four (or three) haem cluster, the cysteines covalently linking the haems to the polypeptide chain and the axial ligands, is primarily responsible for the observed thermostability of these cytochromes (Dolla et al., 1999; Florens et al., 1995). Cytochrome c7 is the most abundant cytochrome in the periplasm of D. acetoxidans and, like most of the cytochromes c3, is most probably reduced physiologically by an [NiFe]hydrogenase (Brugna et al., 1999). The Desulfuromonas bacteria cannot reduce sulfate but requires sulfur as an obligatory respiratory electron acceptor, using acetate as oxidizable substrate. The oxidation of acetate to CO2 is

The protein was extracted and puri®ed as previously described (Probst et al., 1977). The crystals were grown in hanging drops by mixing 4 ml of protein (9 mg mlÀ1 in 20 mM Tris pH 7.6) with 2 ml of reservoir solution containing 20±22% PEG 1000, 0.1 M Tris buffer at pH 7.6. These conditions are close to those previously described (Haser, Payan et al., 1979). Microseeding was necessary in order to obtain suitable crystals for the X-ray diffraction experiments. The crystals belong to space group P212121 and have unit-cell parameters a = 37.55, Ê b = 44.10, c = 45.08 A. The native data set was collected from a single crystal on a Rigaku rotating-anode generator (Cu K), equipped with a MAR Research imaging-plate detector at room temperature, while the MAD data sets were collected from a single crystal on beamline D2AM (Fanchon et al., 1995; Roth et al., 1992) at the ESRF. The crystal for the MAD experiment was cryocooled by transferring it into a solution of mother liquor containing 20% ethylene glycol prior to freezing in an N2 stream at 100 K. The unit-cell parameters Ê changed to a = 37.19, b = 43.83, c = 44.80 A. The data were collected at four wavelengths (Table 1) chosen from the XANES spectrum at the iron K edge measured directly from the protein crystal. No attempt was made to optimize the quality of the anomalous signal by aligning the crystal along any crystallographic axes in order to record Bijvoet re¯ection pairs on the same image. All data were processed with XDS (Kabsch, 1988) and scaled with SCALA (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The data-collection and processing statistics are given in Table 1.

2.2. Structure determination

The structure was solved by the molecular-replacement method using the AMoRe program (Navaza, 1994). The ®rst set of atomic coordinates of the NMR solution structures with PDB code 1new was used as search model. The initial R factor and correlation coef®cient obtained were 0.475 and 0.340, Ê respectively, in the resolution range 13.0±3.8 A. The correlation coef®cient for the next solution was about 0.10 lower. After one cycle of torsion-angle re®nement using the slowcooling protocol as implemented in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) the R factor fell to 24% (Rfree = 38%). However, the 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps calculated at this stage of the procedure were not very instructive and still had signi®cant discontinuities. The MAD data collected on D2AM for a crystal of cytoÊ chrome c7 were only available to 3.8 A resolution owing to the

geometrical arrangement of the goniometer and CCD detector on D2AM combined with the long wavelength at the Ê iron edge (1.74 A). For the same reasons, the X-ray diffraction data sets were insuf®ciently complete (83±87% complete). The Patterson maps were extremely noisy and could not be deconvoluted. However, the use of the iron positions obtained from the molecular-replacement solution gave a set of phases with a mean FOM value of 0.716 with the program SHARP (de La Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997). This led to 729 phased re¯ections (Table 2). The maps calculated with the experimental phases were of very low resolution and did not resolve the structure. In order to enhance the maps obtained from the molecularreplacement solution, the phases obtained from the model were improved by solvent ¯attening and then combined with the MAD phases by Bricogne's adaptation of Sim's weighting scheme (Bricogne, 1976) using the option `combine part' from the program SIGMAA (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The phasecombination statistics are given in Table 2. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the phase combination led to clearly de®ned electron-density maps and the model correction and re®nement were subsequently straightforward. The re®nement was performed with the program CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). The water molecules were placed on inspection of the electron-density maps and three residues (Thr5, Thr14 and Ser55) were modelled in two alternate conformers. When re®ning against the native data Ê set at 1.9 A resolution collected at room temperature, the R factor converged to 19.1% (20± Ê 1.9 A, 5213 re¯ections) for the ®nal model with the inclusion of 116 water molecules. The ®nal re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 3.

conformations), three haem groups and 116 water molecules. To facilitate structural comparison, the same haem nomenclature has been adopted as in Assfalg et al. (1999). According to the convention for cytochromes c3, the haems present in cytochrome c7 are called haem 1, haem 3 and haem 4 in sequential order. The stereochemical quality of the re®ned structure was veri®ed using the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), which shows that 87.9% of the residues are in the most favoured region of the Ramachandran plot and 10.3% are in the additional allowed region. The overall structure resembles that of tetrahaem cytochrome c3, where the region corresponding to haem 2 is simply replaced by a straight polypeptide connection. Analysis of the temperature factors as a function of residue number (colour coded in the representation of Fig. 2b) shows that the B-factor values are highly correlated to the r.m.s. deviation, as obtained for the same residue number in the NMR solution structures with respect to a mean structure (Fig. 2c). Overall, the model obtained from the crystal structure superposes well with the structure determined by NMR methods. Some differences, however, concern the haem geometry and the orientation of the haem axial ligands (Table 4). In particular, the histidineplane angles with respect to each other and with respect to the haem plane show some striking differences, while the overall geometry of the haem packing ®ts quite well (Table 4). The most marked difference concerns His53, the ®fth axial ligand of haem 3, where the hydrogen bond formed with Pro59 (Table 5) is completely missing in the NMR solution structure and the histidine plane takes a different orientation. To a minor extent, the same is true for His30 and His66. The regions for the residues 31±33 and 57±60 have been reported to lack NMR constraints (Assfalg et al., 1998, 1999), which makes these regions dif®cult to determine by NMR methods. They have the highest r.m.s.d. values within the family of NMR structures and this most likely explains the discrepancies between the reported NMR structures and the present crystallographic structure. Moreover, the regions around the haem groups (i.e. the histidine ligands) in the fully oxidized cytochrome structure are particularly dif®cult to obtain by NMR methods, since the oxidized iron is paramagnetic and broadens the NMR lines. The orientation of the histidine plane with respect to the haem plane is known to in¯uence the redox potential of the haem iron (Guigliarelli et al., 1990). Compared with those observed in the homologous cytochromes c3 (Czjzek, Payan & Haser, 1994; Nùrager et al.,

1999), the values obtained from the crystal structure of oxidized cytochrome c7 are very similar and re¯ect well the high conservation of the haem-core and haem-coordination geometry (see Table 4). Throughout the determined structures, exceptions are only observed for the values of the histidines that are the sixth axial ligand of haem 1, haem 3 and haem 4, respectively. In occurrence, the plane of the histidine which is the sixth axial ligand of haem 4 in cytochrome c3 from Desulfomicrobium baculatus Norway (Dmbn) is oriented in an almost perpendicular manner to those of the equivalent histidines in all the other cytochromes c3. It had been postulated that this change in orientation was the result of a highly conserved tyrosine residue missing in cytochrome c3 from Dmbn that shields the sixth axial ligand from the solvent in all other cytochromes c3 (Czjzek, Payan & Haser, 1994).

However, site-directed mutagenesis experiments on dimeric octahaem cytochrome c3 (cc3) from Dmbn, where this tyrosine Tyr73 has been replaced by a glutamic acid (the equivalent residue in cytochrome c3 from Dmbn) show that this mutation did not in¯uence the histidine orientation. On the contrary,

the mutation Tyr73Glu in cc3 perturbs the interaction with the periplasmic [NiFeSe] hydrogenase (Czjzek et al., 1996). Another feature de®ning the histidine-plane orientation is the hydrogen-bonding pattern involving the N1 atoms of the histidine residues (Table 5). The pattern is highly conserved throughout the cytochrome c3 structures (Czjzek, Payan & Haser, 1994; Matias et al., 1996) and involves conserved water

molecules close to haem 1 which are also present in cytochrome c7. Interestingly, the sixth axial ligand of haem 4 in the crystal structure of cytochrome c7 has the same orientation as in cytochrome c3 of Dmbn and the conserved tyrosine is also missing in the sequence of cytochrome c7 (Fig. 3). Structurally, a lysine residue takes the place of the tyrosine, shielding the histidine from the solvent (Fig. 4). This is obviously a second example where a changed orientation of the plane of the histidine that is the sixth axial ligand of haem 4 is coupled to the lack of a highly conserved residue. However, as has been shown above by the mentioned mutagenesis studies, the conserved tyrosine residue is apparently not the only factor governing the histidine-plane orientation. Another example of the histidine planes having an exceptional different orientation is encountered for His17 in cytochrome c7 and the equivalent His24 in the acidic cytochrome c3 from Desulfovibrio africanus (Nùrager et al., 1999). The sequence alignments in Nùrager et al. (1999) and in Fig. 3 reveal that these cytochromes are both missing an extremely well conserved proline residue close to the N-terminus. This proline residue, which precedes the ®rst -strand, has its ring plane approximately parallel to the histidine that is the sixth axial ligand of haem 1 in all other structures reported for the superfamily cytochrome c3, including the octahaem cytoÄ chromes c3 (Frazao et al., 1999; Czjzek et al., 1996) and the nonahaem cytochrome (Matias et al., 1999). These examples seem to point out that, together with other factors, the highly conserved proline and tyrosine residues are to some extent responsible for the His-plane orientation. Furthermore, these two residues, the proline in the N-terminal region and the tyrosine in the C-terminal region, are each facing the solvent, shielding the neighboring histidine on the most solventexposed edge of the corresponding haem group. This could implicate that these residues are important either for electron transport and/or for the interaction of the concerned haem groups and the interacting physiological partners. Indeed, numerous studies have demonstrated that in cytochromes c3 it is haem 4 which lies in the site interacting with the periplasmic

hydrogenase (Brugna et al., 1998; Dolla et al., 1991; Guerlesquin et al., 1985; Haladjian et al., 1987). As in other cytochromes c3, the region around haem 4 in cytochrome c7 contains a cluster of lysine residues (see Fig. 4a) responsible for a global positive charge around haem 4. We therefore conclude again that haem 4 is the most probable site of electrostatic interaction of cytochrome c7 with its physiological partners. molecule faces haem 4 of a symmetry-related molecule Ê (FeÐFe distance 19.3 A; Fig. 5a) and haem 4 of the same molecule faces haem 3 of another symmetric molecule Ê (FeÐFe distance 16.7 A; Fig. 5b). These distances are of the same order as those observed for the intramolecular FeÐFe distances of the haem groups (Table 4). Since the driving forces for crystallization are governed by intermolecular protein±protein attraction, which are most often of electrostatic nature, and the same is true for the interaction of redox proteins with their physiological partners along the electron3.2. Crystal packing and intermolecular interactions transport pathway, these interacting regions may be of functional relevance. Furthermore, kinetic studies have In the crystal each molecule makes intermolecular contacts demonstrated a cooperative process for some cytochromes c3, with nine neighbours. The crystal consists of a lattice of closewhich is most easily explained by intermolecular interactions packed molecules interwoven with extremely small canals of Ê (Brugna et al., 1998). solvent (about 5 A in diameter), corresponding to a volume The ®rst contact region, bringing haem 1 close to haem 4 of fraction of 32%. The asymmetric unit contains one molecule a symmetry-related molecule, is interesting because the and the arrangement of the molecules in the crystal packing propionate groups of haem 1 are facing two lysine residues, creates two intermolecular close contacts that bring the Lys41 and Lys42, in proximity to haem 4, but no direct salt respective haem groups close to each other. Haem 1 of one bridge is formed (Fig. 5a). The involvement of lysine residues in the interaction of multihaem ctype cytochromes with their redox partners has been long established (Dolla et al., 1991; Stewart et al., 1989). A very interesting feature can be observed at the other interacting region, involving Lys10 and Lys62. Here, haem 4 of one molecule is facing haem 3 of a symmetry-related molecule and the haem planes are almost parallel to each other (Fig. 5b). This parallel but offset arrangement is often observed in electron-transport proteins containing haem groups, such as cytochrome c554 (Iverson et al., 1998) and the photosynthetic reaction centre, between the two bacteriochlorophyll groups that form the special pair (Deisenhofer et al., 1985). All in all, only a limited number of haem packing motifs have been observed (Iverson et al., 1998) and they may re¯ect favourable Figure 5 haem±haem interactions that Intermolecular contacts in the crystal packing bringing haem groups of symmetry-related molecules into close proximity.

Ê 3 A). This close contact between cysteine±vinyl linkages intriguingly resembles that observed at the dimer interface of the octahaem cytochrome c3 (Czjzek et al., 1996) between the two haem 1s of each monomer. Recently, a very similar contact between a cysteine±vinyl linkage on one side and a cysteine±Fe bond of a Fe4S4 centre on the other has also been observed in the electron-transfer complexes of ferredoxin (Morelli, Dolla et al., 2000) and [NiFe]-hydrogenase with the cytochrome c553 (Morelli, Czjzek et al., 2000) of Desulfovibrio species. All these examples favour the assumption that this close contact is one possible relevant arrangement for favourable electron transfer between haem groups. It is noteworthy that thin solid ®lms of cytochrome c3 from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki display a particularly low resistance when exposed to electrodes (Kimura et al., 1979). Moreover, kinetic studies of this type of cytochrome have shown that they reduce their physiological partner, the hydrogenase, in a cooperative process (Brugna et al., 1998). This cooperativity was explained by cytochrome±cytochrome interactions forming a `chain' of c3-type cytochromes. When analyzing the crystal packing, it can be noticed that this close contact between haems 4 and haem 3 of an adjacent molecule expands throughout the crystal in a one-dimensional zigzagging chain (Fig. 5c). It is therefore possible to conclude that this contact could lead to an intermolecular electron-transfer pathway between cytochrome c7 molecules.
