The interactions of N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-1-methyl-4-[1-methyl-4-[4-formamido-1-methylimidazole-2carboxamido]imidazole-2-carboxamido]imidazole-2-carboxamide (AR-1-144), a tri-imidazole polyamide minor groove binder, with DNA have been investigated by NMR and CD spectroscopy. A series of DNA oligonucleotides with a C/G-containing four-bp core, i.e. CCGG, CGCG, GGCC, and GCGC, have been titrated with AR-1-144 at different ratios. AR-1-144 favors the CCGG sequence. The flanking sequence of the CCGG core also influences the binding preference, with a C or T being favored on the 3 H -side of the CCGG core. The threedimensional structure of the symmetric 2 : 1 side-by-side complex of AR-1-144 and GAACCGGTTC, determined by NOE-constrained NMR refinement, reveals that each AR-1-144 binds to four base pairs, i.e. at C5-G6-G7-T8, with every amide-imidazole unit forming two potential hydrogen bonds with DNA. The same DNA binding preference of AR-1-144 was also confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy, indicating that the DNA binding preference of AR-1-144 is independent of concentration. The cooperative binding of an AR-1-144 homodimer to the (purine)CCGG(pyrimidine) core sequence appears to be weaker than that of the distamycin A homodimer to A/T sequences, most likely due to the diminished hydrophobic interactions between AR-1-144 and DNA. Our results are consistent with previous footprinting data and explain the binding pattern found in the crystal structure of a di-imidazole drug bound to CATGGCCATG. Keywords: anti-cancer drug; drug design; DNA structure; sequence specific recognition.

Cooperative DNA±binding interactions have been observed for minor groove binders (MGBs). Distamycin A (Fig. 1A), an N-methylpyrrole-containing anticancer antibiotic, can bind to the minor groove of DNA duplexes at a stretch of A-T base pairs, either in a monomeric [1] or a side-by-side dimeric [2±4] binding mode. In a 1 : 1 drug/DNA binding mode, DNA with a GC-containing sequence has amino protons protruding from G in the minor groove which present steric hindrance to the N-methylpyrrole (Py)-containing drug and prevent the drug binding. Moreover, GC sequence is generally associated with a wider minor groove than that of AT sequences [5±7]. This makes a single drug fit to GC sequences less snugly, reducing the favorable hydrophobic interactions between the drug and DNA minor groove walls [8]. On the other hand, GC sequences can accommodate two drug molecules without a significant additional widening of the minor groove. Studies of MGBs have been reviewed recently [9,10]. An extension of such an analysis is that it is possible to take advantage of the additional G-N2 amino group in the minor

groove for specific recognition. If the Py unit is replaced with an N-methylimidazole (Im) unit, its imino nitrogen atom then can receive a hydrogen bond from the guanine base. In a 2 : 1 binding mode the two Im-containing molecules could move to the respective DNA strands away from the center, forming favorable hydrogen bonds with G-C base pairs. Therefore, it may be assumed that Im-containing polyamides have G-C specificity. The issue related to the recognition associated with an Im/Im pair had been addressed with the synthesis of a number of Im-containing polyamides whose preferred binding-sequences analyzed by methidium-propylethylene-diaminetetraacetateiron(II) [MPE´Fe(II)] footprinting experiments [11]. The results suggested that the preferred sequences indeed involve G-C sequences, particularly a string of Gs (e.g. TCGGGCT for triIm polyamide) [11]. However, it is less clear what is the order of preference among the GC-rich sequences. More recently, sequence-specific compounds have been designed by exploiting the binding of side-by-side antiparallel homo- and heterodimers of Py- or Im-containing oligopeptides to the minor groove of DNA, and they have been subjected to a variety of biochemical and biophysical studiues [3,4,12±21]. Significantly, some of them can recognize longer `mixed' sequences [22,23]. Through such studies on the binding preference of unlinked and linked homo- and heterodimers of synthetic polyamide peptides, significant understanding of the molecular basis of DNA binding specificity of different types of polyamides has been obtained. A `recognition rule' derived from combination of various motifs has been proposed [24], where the Im/Py pair is better suited for the recognition of G-C, but not C-G, or

Sample preparation AR-1-144 was prepared as described previously [11]. The AR-1-144 stock solution (30 mm) for NMR studies was prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of AR-1-144 in 500 mL of a 90% H2O/10% D2O solution plus 10 mL of dilute HCl solution to increase the solubility of the drug. The DNA oligonucleotides GAACCGGTTC, GATCCGGATC, GTGCCGGCAC, GAACGCGTTC, GAAGCGCTTC, GATGGCCATC were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer in the Genetic Facility at University of Illinois, purified by Sepharose G-50 (Pharmacia) column chromatography and lyophilized. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving the oligonucleotides in 530 mL phosphate buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 90% H2O/10% D2O). For the drug/DNA titration monitored by 1D 1H NMR, small scale DNA samples (0.5 mm doublestranded DNA) were prepared. For structural analysis, a large scale GAACCGGTTC sample (1.25 mm) was used to collect 2D-NMR data. DNA samples were titrated by stepwise addition of AR-1-144, monitored by 1D 1H NMR. For the nonexchangeable proton NMR experiments, samples were prepared as described previously [26]. NMR data collection NMR measurements were made on a Varian Inova 750 MHz or on a Varian VXR500 500 MHz spectrometer. 1D 1H NMR spectra in H2O were recorded using the 1-1 pulse sequence [27] for all samples at 2 8C. The chemical shift in parts per million (p.p.m.) were referenced to the HDO peak, which is calibrated to sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propane-1-sulfonate at different temperatures. Phase sensitive NOESY spectrum of the AR-1144/GAACCGGTTC complex in D2O was recorded at 750 MHz at 15 8C with 2048 points in the t2 dimension and 512 complex FIDs in the t1 dimension with 32 scans per FID [28]. The recycle delay was 6 s with an average T1 of 3 s, and the mixing time was 200 ms. A TOCSY spectrum of the complex was also recorded with 2048 points in the t2 dimension and 512 complex FIDs in the t1 dimension with eight scans per FID. The 2D-NOESY spectrum of the complex in H2O was recorded at 500 MHz at 2 8C using the 1±1 pulse sequence as the read pulse [27]. All NMR data sets were processed with the program felix v.1.1 (formerly from Hare Research, Woodinville, WA) and felix 97 (Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego, CA) on Silicon Graphics workstations. The 2D-NOESY and TOCSY in D2O and 2D-NOESY spectra in H2O were used to assign (by the standard sequential assignment procedure) the resonances of all nonexchangeable and exchangeable protons. Structural refinement The initial model of the symmetrical 2 : 1 complex was constructed by docking two AR-1-144 molecules in a side-byside orientation to the minor groove of GAACCGGTTC using quanta (version 4.0, Molecular Simulation Inc., San Diego, CA) and midas (University of California), guided by the NOE data and the crystal structure of Chen et al. [3]. Two alternative models with symmetric drug binding sites were generated by sliding the two drug molecules toward or away from each other. The displacement of the alternative binding site from the Ê original site is about 1.5 A for each drug. Then, five models were generated for each of the three initial complexes by

A-T/T-A, base pairs [24], whereas an Im/Im pair has ambiguous sequence-specific and weaker binding properties. The latter observations seem to disagree with the aforementioned results from the chemical footprinting experiments, in which the tri-Im polyamide did show a sequence-preference for certain G-rich sequences (e.g. for TCGGGCT) [11]. Therefore, it remains to be determined what are the preferred binding sequences for Im-containing polyamides among the GC-rich sequences, and their molecular basis for the recognition between Im-containing polyamides and DNA. Moreover, how might those MGBs modulate the target sequences for potent anticancer alkylating drugs like CC-1065 and duocarmycins [25]? Can those MGBs have sequence specificity toward unusual base pairings (e.g. the T-G mismatched base pair)? As a first step in addressing these issues, we used high resolution NMR and CD spectroscopy to probe the binding mode of a tri-Im polyamide molecule, AR-1-144 (Fig. 1B). Our results show that AR-1-144 exhibits a cooperative binding mode as a homodimer to the (purine) CCGG(pyrimidine) core sequence and the structural basis for such a binding mode has been provided.

following the simulated annealing protocol as described in xplor [29]. The root-mean-square deviations of the 15 starting models (see below) from the `average structure' Ê Ê Ê were 1.129 A for the complex, 1.097 A for DNA and 1.267 A for the drug (Table 1). The structural refinement was carried out by the procedure spedref [26]. The procedure calculates the simulated 2D NOE spectrum using the full matrix relaxation method (from morass [30]) on the basis of a molecular model. The volume of all NOE peaks is measured and compared between the experimental and the calculated spectra. The difference of the experimental and the simulated volumes is minimized by a conjugated gradient procedure in xplor to adjust the interproton distances and generate a new starting model. The procedure is interative and a NMR R-factor is used to monitor the progress of the refinement. The NOE-restraints were applied during refinement using the asymmetric biharmonic energy functions according to Ê Ê Ê the interproton distances (, 2.2 A; 2.2±3.5 A; 3.5±4.5 A; and Ê ) as described in xplor. Overlapped peaks were . 4.5 A deconvoluted as described before [26] to maximize the information retrieved from the experimental data. The use of the full-matrix relaxation theory (which takes spin diffusion into consideration) on the basis of a molecular model reduces the need for collecting multiple 2D-NOESY data at different mixing times. We have chosen a mixing time of 200 ms, which provided a compromise of optimal number of NOE crosspeaks and moderate spin diffusion. Fifteen exchangeable proton 2D-NOESY crosspeaks between drug and DNA were measured and included as part of the constraints. As the exact exchange rate of the exchangeable protons was not known, the NOE-restrained energy functions

were given a more `flattened' curve, reflecting the greater uncertainty associated with those NOE terms. The force field parameters of AR-1-144 were generated through the standard database in xplor whose all-atom force field for DNA was used with explicit hydrogen-bond potentials. The 15 starting models were each subjected to 40 refinement cycles of NOE-restrained conjugate gradient minimization using xplor. Twofold symmetry constraints of the complex were also applied in the refinement. The experimental NMR correlation time (tc) was determined to have an optimal value of 9 ns by testing empirically a range of tc values in the NMR refinement. The optimal tc was associated with the best refined structure (lowest R-factor and lowest energy for the model). The `average structure' of the 15 refined structures was energy-minimized and further subjected to another 40 cycles of NOE-restrained conjugate gradient refinement, and it is used for further discussion. The NMR R-factor is defined as R-factor = S|No ±Nc|/SNo, where No and Nc are the experimental and calculated NOE integrals, respectively. The refinement and structural statistics are listed in Table 1. A total of 1474 NOE restraints have been retrieved from the experimental data by deconvolution, of which 283 NOEs have overlaps of less than 30%. It should be noted that the reliability of the NOE information depends on the degree of overlap; the less overlapped the peaks are, the more reliable the NOE information. The number of `reliable' NOEs (<30 NOEs per nucleotide) is comparable to that used by other workers in the field. The final coordinates and all relevant NOE constraints have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Databank (Accession number 1b0s for coordinates and r1b0smr for NMR restraints).

CD titration studies All experiments were performed with a continuous flow of nitrogen purging the Jasco-710 spectropolarimeter. A path length cell of 1-mm was used and all experiments were performed at room temperature. The studies were conducted using 0.05 mm (bp) of oligonucleotide solutions (100 mL). Specific aliquots of a 1.0-mm solution of AR-1-144 (prepared with one equivalent of HCl in water) were titrated into the DNA solutions that corresponded to the following r H (moles of ligand to DNA base pairs ratio) values: 0, 0.025, 0.050, 0.075, 0.100, 0.125, 0.150, 0.175, 0.200, 0.225, 0.250, 0.275, 0.300, 0.325, 0.350, 0.375, 0.400, 0.450, 0.500, 0.600, 0.700, 0.800, 0.900, 1.00. The standard scan parameters for all experiments were as follows. The wavelengths were scanned from 400 nm to 220 nm. The sensitivity was set at 1 mdeg and the scan speed was set at 500 nm per minute. Three scans were accumulated and averaged by the computer.

Formation of drug-DNA complexes In order to find a suitable DNA sequence with that AR-1-144 forms a stable complex for 2D-NMR studies, various DNA oligomers including GAACCGGTTC, GATCCGGATC, GTGCCGGCAC, GAACGCGTTC, GAAGCGCTTC and GATGGCCATC were titrated with AR-1-144 and analyzed by 1D 1H NMR. Addition of AR-1-144 to solutions of the DNA decamers caused extensive changes in their NMR spectra as monitored by the DNA imino and drug amide proton resonances (Fig. 2). This region of the resonances is located far downfield from most other resonances (i.e. less overlap), thus convenient for following the titration. Inspection of the titration spectra reveals several interesting results. First, it is evident that of the four C/G-containing core sequences, i.e. CCGG, CGCG, GGCC, and GCGC, only the CCGG-containing decamers have well-resolved spectra for the drug/DNA complexes (Fig. 2A,C,D). Addition of AR-1-144 to the three remaining DNA sequences GAACGCGTTC, GAAGCGCTTC and GATGGCCATC resulted in broad spectra (Fig. 2E for GATGGCCATC and the rest not shown), suggesting that either no stable drug/DNA complexes and/or complexes with multiple binding modes were formed. Therefore only sequences containing the CCGG core sequence provide a good binding site for AR-1-144. Note that in the spectrum of the 2 : 1 ratio solution of AR-1-144 and GAACCGGTTC (Fig. 2A and 2B), the resonances from both the free DNA and the complex coexist. The chemical shifts of the free DNA resonances remain unchanged, suggesting that the exchange rate between the free DNA and bound DNA is slow on the NMR time scale. Close inspection of Fig. 2A suggests that there are prominent chemical shift changes of most amide protons between the free and bound AR-1-144 (e.g. a <2 p.p.m. chemical shift difference for NH2). In addition, there is only one set of resonances arising from the complex which remain unchanged throughout the titration. The new resonances are from the symmetrical 2 : 1 complex as shown by the structural analysis (see below). During the titration analysis, some resonances, which are either from free DNA or other species not from the 2 : 1 complex, were observed until the drug/DNA ratio reached 3 : 1. The resonances from the unbound drug, especially that of the terminal amino-methyl group, could be observed in the 1D profile at a ratio of 3 : 1 AR-1-144/DNA (Fig. 2B). These

The arrows in (B) indicate the TM1/TM2 methyl resonances of the dimethylamino group from the excess free drug in solution. Their chemical shifts are more downfield than those of the free drug due to the exchange between the bound and the unbound drugs. (F) Titration of both distamycin A and AR-1-144 to GAACCGGTTC indicates that the Dist/AR-1-144/DNA heterodimer complex is more stable than the AR-1-144/DNA homodimer complex.

observations suggest that a 3 : 1 drug/DNA ratio is needed to get a fully formed 2 : 1 drug/DNA complex, indicating that the formation of the 2 : 1 complex has only a moderate affinity. Nevertheless, 44 intermolecular 2D-NOE crosspeaks (less than 30% overlap) between AR-1-144 and GAACCGGTTC (see below) could be measured and used for structural analysis of the 2 : 1 complex (Table 1). Interestingly there are differences in the titration behavior among the four CCGG-containing sequences, depending on the flanking sequences. When the flanking A-T sequence is reversed from ACCGGT (Fig. 2A) to TCCGGA (Fig. 2D), the general binding property remains similar, but some differences are found. Note that more free DNA resonances of GATCCGGATC remain than does GAACCGGTTC in the 2 : 1 solution, which indicates a lower binding affinity of GATCCGGATC. When the flanking sequence is changed from ACCGGT (Fig. 2A) to GCCGGC (Fig. 2C), the binding property appears to be similar for the two sequences. Therefore

the binding of AR-1-144 to the ACCGGT and GCCGGC sequences is tighter than to the TCCGGA sequence, i.e. a pyrimidine (C or T) on the 3 H -side of the CCGG sequence is preferred. This conclusion is supported by the circular dichroism study discussed later. Structure of the AR-1-144/DNA complex Many important intermolecular NOEs (some are listed in Table 2) were used to position AR-1-144 in the DNA minor groove. Some notable NOEs [e.g. ARH13C4H1 H (peak a),

ARH13C5H1 H (peak b)], shown in Fig. 3A, indicate that the Im1 unit is close to the C4 and C5 sugars. In addition, the formyl H1 proton is close to the C4H1 H , C4H2 H H , C5H1 H , and C5H4 H protons, suggesting that the formyl end of AR-1-144 is close to the C4 and C5 nucleotides (Table 2). The methylene protons of the positively charged dimethylamine tail show NOEs to A13H2 and several C14, T8 and T9 protons, suggesting that tail is close to the A13-T8 base pair. There are NOEs between the two symmetry-related AR-1-144 s which further constrain the relative positioning of the two drugs in the minor groove (Table 2). In fact the formyl

H1 proton has quite strong NOE crosspeaks to the methylene protons of the dimethylamine tail, validating the head-to-tail arrangement of the homodimer of AR-1-144 in the minor groove. Fifteen starting models (Fig. 4A, left) were refined to NMR R-factors of <22%, and the agreement between the experimental and simulated NOESY spectra can be partly seen in Fig. 3A. Some parts of the complex, including the A3-T18 (= A13-T8) and the terminal base pairs, are flexible, resulting in multiple conformations (Fig. 4A, right). The central portion (CCGG) of the refined `average structure' is shown in Fig. 4B. The refined structures from all starting models have an overall Ê rmsd about 0.5 A, suggesting that the NOE-restrained refinement procedure described here is capable of arriving at convergent refined structures. The binding of two AR-1-144 ligands in the minor groove of B-DNA widens the DNA groove width at the binding site to Ê 8.4 A, compared with other relevant minor groove widths (calculated by the closest P-P distance across the groove, then Ê minus 5.8 A to represent van der Waals radii of two phosphate Ê groups) of idealized B-DNA (5.7 A), uncomplexed G,C-rich Ê DNA from two crystal structures of CCAGGCCTGG (5.2 A) Ê [5] and ACCGCCGGCGCC + GGCGCCGGCGGT (7.4 A)

[31], respectively. The value seen in the AR-1-144/DNA complex is not very different to those found in other Ê Ê MGB-DNA complexes which range from 7.3 A to 7.9 A [3,4,21]. Exchangeable proton NMR data suggesting hydrogen bonding schemes Additional information can be obtained from the exchangeable proton NMR data. All five DNA imino proton resonances of the AR-1-144/GAACCGGTTC complex were detected at 2 8C, even for the terminal G1 imino (Fig. 2A). Figure 3B shows the exchangeable proton 2D-NOESY data of the imino/amide-toaromatic/H1 H /H5/amino crosspeak regions. The sequential imino proton connectivity can be traced from G1 on one end to G6 in the center without interruption, suggesting that the duplex is mostly intact. The NOE connectivities between the imino protons and amino protons and the base nonexchangeable proton (AH2) (e.g. G-imino to C-amino across the G-C base pair and T-imino to AH2 across the A-T base pair), establish the Watson±Crick pairing at all base pairs. Both imino protons of T8 and T9 were observed. However, the N6 amino proton

resonances of A3 are so broad that no distinct T8NH3-A3N6H crosspeak was detected. This observation is consistent with the dynamic property of A3-T18/A13-T8 base pairs in the refined models (Fig. 4A, right). It is likely that the proximity of the dimethylamino tail of AR-1-144 to these two base pairs may cause the dimethylamino tail to interfere with the openingclosing process of the A3-T18/A13-T8 base pairs, resulting in instability of the base pairs. Note that the G6N2/G7N2 amino protons are detected as well-resolved peaks, suggesting that the rotation about the C2-N2 bond in these two guanines is slow, consistent with the fact that the G-N2 amino group is involved in the hydrogen bonding interaction with the Im nitrogen of AR-1-144 (Fig. 4 and 5). For example, the strong crosspeaks between ARNH2 amide proton and G6N2 amino protons (Fig. 3B) indicate that the Im2 unit is close to G6 base. The crosspeaks between ARNH1 amide proton and G16N2 as well as G17N2 amino protons are also detected (Fig. 3B; note that only one set of resonances is arising from the symmetrical complex). NOE crosspeaks of ARNH13G16N2 are stronger than those of the ARNH13G17N2, which also indicate that Im1 unit is close to C5 base of the C5-G16 base pair. The model of the complex is schematically shown in Fig. 1C, and key intermolecular hydrogen bonds are illustrated in Fig. 5.

Sequence preference of AR-1-144 Figure 4B shows the close-up view of the homodimer of AR-1-144 bound with the CCGG sequence. Each Im unit forms two hydrogen bonds with a G-C base pair. Each amide NH proton of Im1, Im2 and Im3 units donates a hydrogen bond to C5O2, G6N3 and G7N3, respectively. At the same time, each imino-nitrogen atom of Im1, Im2 and Im3 units receives a hydrogen bond from the N2 amino group of G16, G6 and G7, respectively. The observation of two resolved N2 amino proton resonances (Fig. 3B) of both G6 and G7 bases supports the proposed hydrogen bonding interactions. Interestingly, the fourth amide proton NH4 forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with both T8O2 and C14O2 (Fig. 5). The observed hydrogen bonding network defines the sequence preference of 5 H -CCGG for recognition. Note that in each AR-1-144 molecule, the Im2 and Im3 parts recognize the G6-G7 step by having an one-to-one match of Im unit with a single guanine base. Therefore, the side-by-side homodimeric binding of AR-1-144 would favor a CCGG sequence due to the twofold symmetry. The N2 amino group of the central guanines (G6 and G16) is involved in a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atoms from the Im1 and Im2 rings. In this arrangement, the Im1 unit from one AR-1-144 is stacked over

the carboxyl end of the Im2 unit from the other AR-1-144. The two positively charged dimethylamine groups are located on the opposite ends of the dimers in the minor groove (Fig. 1C). For the GGCC sequence, the favorable interactions between two consecutive Im-Im units with the GpG sequence would put the two positively charged dimethylamine groups of AR-1-144 molecules close to each other, which would destabilize the sideby-side interactions of the two AR-1-144 s. When the core sequence of the complex is changed to CGCG or GCGC, our modeling study reveals that some of the hydrogen bonds between AR-1-144 and DNA no longer exist, especially those between the Im2 unit and C6 in the CGCG sequence, and those between the Im3 unit and C7 in the GCGC sequence. Our structural analysis of the sequence preference is consistent with the results from 1D-NMR titrations shown in Fig. 2. Circular dichroism study Binding of AR-1-144 to the same series of oligonucleotides was also studied by CD spectroscopy. Interaction of MGBs with DNA generally produces intense induced CD bands characteristic of the p3p* transition of the ligand, at about 300 nm [32,33]. Stoichiometric titration of AR-1-144 to the GAACCGGTTC, GATCCGGATC, GATCGCGATC, and GATGGCCATC were performed, and in each case DNA-induced bands at < 330 nm was recorded. A set of representative overlaid titration curves for GAACCGGTTC is given in Fig. 6A, and plots of molar ellipticities of the induced bands vs. r H values for

all four oligonucleotides are depicted in Fig. 6B. Because the AR-1-144 does not exhibit a CD spectrum, appearance of the induced band in each case provides evidence of its binding to the oligonucleotides. Note that, each oligonucleotide interacted differently with AR-1-144, as indicated by the different levels of induced molar ellipticities at <330 nm for similar r H values in the titration studies (Fig. 6B). It is clear that titration of AR-1-144 to GAACCGGTTC gave the strongest binding as indicated by the steepest rise in the molar ellipticity of the induce band, followed by GATCCGGATC, then GATCGCGATC, and finally GATGGCCATC. Following a sharp rise in the molar ellipticity of the induced band for GAACCGGTTC,

the signal reached a saturation point as evidenced by a decline in the intensity at r H of about 0.33 (or about 2/6). These CD results are consistent with the NMR data. Saturation points were less clear for GATCCGGATC and GATCGCGATC, and nonevident for GATGGCCATC. Further analysis of the overlaid titration spectra for GAACCGGTTC given in Fig. 6A shows an isodichroic point at <310 nm, indicating that the drug is binding to the DNA through a single motif.

DISCUSSION
The intra- and intermolecular NOE crosspeaks for the AR-1-144/GAACCGGTTC 2 : 1 complex established the homodimer of AR-1-144 binding to the minor groove in a side-by-side arrangement. There are specific interactions (which are within possible hydrogen bonding distances) in the homodimeric binding of AR-1-144 to GAACCGGTTC as illustrated in Fig. 5. Note that every Im ring receives a possible hydrogen bond from N2 amino group of G and its amide proton donates a possible hydrogen bond to the N3 of the same G. Such a hydrogen bonding pattern explains the preference for the CCGG sequence of AR-1-144. However, the binding of AR-1-144 to the CCGG sequence is less tight than the binding of distamycin A to A/T-sequences (either 2 : 1 or 1 : 1 binding mode). As shown in Fig. 2, in order to achieve the full formation of the 2 : 1 complex, an excess of 2 : 1 ratio of AR-1-144 to DNA is needed. In contrast, the formation of the 2 : 1 distamycin/DNA complex is complete without any excess of distamycin [2]. This is consistent with the earlier analysis by others [24,34]. Interestingly, when we titrated distamycin A into a solution containing 1 : 1 ratio of AR-1-144 and GAACCGGTTC duplex, all resonances associated with the symmetric 2 : 1 AR-1-144/ GAACCGGTTC complex (seen in Fig. 2A) were replaced by new resonances derived from the asymmetric 1 : 1 : 1 distamycin/AR-1-144/GAACCGGTTC ternary complex (Fig. 2F). Our results suggested that the hetero Py-Py-Py/Im-Im-Im dimer has a stronger DNA binding affinity than the homo Im-Im-Im/Im-Im-Im dimer. The data is consistent with the interpretation that in the absence of a competitor like distamycin A, molecules containing only the Im unit (like AR-1-144) can still have a certain sequence preference. It is interesting to ask what is the basis for this affinity difference, even though more hydrogen bonding interactions are found in the AR-1-144/DNA complex than in the distamycin/DNA complex. It is likely that the hydrophobic interactions between the pyrroles of distamycin and the minor groove surface of DNA (including the sugar and AH2 atoms) contribute significantly for the distamycin binding to DNA. In contrast, the hydrogen bonds between the Im of AR-1-144 and DNA can be fulfilled without a net gain of free energy by those derived from water molecules. Four amide protons of AR-1-144 all form possible hydrogen bonds with DNA, specifically NH1 with C5O2, NH2 with G6N3, NH3 with G7N3 and NH4 with both T8O2 and C14O2, via a bifurcated hydrogen bond (Fig. 5). These hydrogen bonds define the binding specificity toward the CCGG sequence. Ring 1, ring 2 and ring 3 of one AR-1-144 stack on the third, second and first amide group of another AR-1-144, respectively (Fig. 1C). The stacking energies contribute to stabilize the homodimer formation in the minor groove. Our analysis also explains the recent crystal structure of the 2 : 1 complex between a di-Im MGB with CATGGCCATG, in which the di-Im MGB is bound toward one end of the duplex in the minor groove [19]. One drug is packed against the

C7-A8-T9-G10 strand, whereas the other drug is packed against the G14-G15-C16-C17 strand. As discussed earlier, Im-containing MGB prefers binding to the GG sequence, with the positively charged dimethylamine group of drug pointing toward the 3 H -side of the GG sequence. Consequently the partner drug would bind to base pairs on the 3 H -side of the complementary CC sequence on the opposite strand, which was observed in the crystal structure [19]. The results from the CD study are consistent with those from the NMR study. Since the CD study was carried out at a 50 mm (duplex) concentration, nearly 20 times lower than that of the NMR concentration, the results suggest that the sequence preference of AR-1-144 is not concentration-dependent. In summary, the CD and NMR results presented in this paper, and supported from published MPE´Fe(II) footprinting results [11], provide evidence that Im-containing analogues of distamycin can effectively bind to specific sequences of DNA in the 2 : 1 side-by-side dimer motif. Studies here and elsewhere [23] will improve the understanding of the interactions of those MGBs and DNA, which may lead to better designs of new ligands with novel biological activities [35,36]. There remain new questions to be answered. For example, while our preliminary results indicated that the binding affinity for a homodimeric mode of AR-1-144 is lower than that of the heterodimeric mode in conjunction with distamycin, the exact binding mode of the 1 : 1 : 1 distamycin/AR-1-144/GAACCGGTTC complex remains to be determined. More recently, we discovered that Im/Im pairs show a strong binding affinity toward sequences containing T-G wobble base pairs (unpublished results). Therefore, while an Im/Im may not have an ideal sequence recognition property toward Watson-Crick base pairs, it may be used in certain specifically designed MGBs to probe noncanonical DNA structures. Finally, while AR-1-144 itself does not have strong cytotoxicity [37,38], it may be combined or linked with other potent anticancer compounds such as duocarmycin to create new dimeric agents. A similar strategy has been used for a distamycin-analog (lexitropsin) and enediyne compound [38,39]. As a first step toward this goal, we are interested in finding out how AR-1-144 modulates the alkylating sequence of duocarmycin A and CC-1065 [25]. Those studies are underway, and some of those results from this will be presented elsewhere [40].
