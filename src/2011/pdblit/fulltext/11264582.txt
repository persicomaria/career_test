Identification of a small-molecule binding site at the dimer interface of the HIV integrase catalytic domain
Integration of the reverse-transcribed HIV cDNA into the host DNA is a required step in viral replication. The virusencoded integrase protein catalyzes the initial DNA breaking and joining reactions that mediate cDNA integration. Here, the identi®cation by X-ray crystallography of a small-molecule binding site on the integrase catalytic domain is reported. The small-molecule family studied consists of a core of arsenic or phosphorus surrounded by four aromatic groups. Two arsenic derivatives were visualized bound to integrase. In each case, two molecules bound at symmetry-related sites on the catalytic domain dimer interface. The ®rst compound studied, tetraphenyl arsonium, did not inhibit integrase. However, a synthetic compound substituting a catechol for one of the phenyl rings, dihydroxyphenyltriphenylarsonium, bound to the same site and did inhibit the enzyme. Changes in the vicinity of the catalytic site were seen with the inhibitory compound only, potentially explaining its mechanism of action. Further substituting phosphonium for arsonium yielded a compound with an IC50 in the low micromolar range. These ®ndings may be useful in designing new inhibitors of integrase, which is at present the only one of the three HIV enzymes for which clinically useful inhibitors are not available.

1. Introduction
The human immunode®ciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes three enzymes, reverse transcriptase (RT), protease (PR) and integrase (IN). Drugs targeting RT and PR are in wide use, but owing to the development of resistant strains new drugs are needed. HIV IN is an attractive target since it is the third HIV enzyme and there are no known cellular enzymes that function similarly, raising the hope that integrase inhibitors could be relatively non-toxic (Hansen et al., 1998; Bushman et al., 1998; Pommier et al., 1997; Cof®n et al., 1997). HIV-1 IN is composed of three functional domains (Eijkelenboom et al., 1997; Cai et al., 1997; Yang & Steitz, 1995; Dyda et al., 1994; Bujacz et al., 1995). The N-terminal domain is comprised of residues 1±50 and contains a HHCC motif that binds zinc ions. The catalytic domain (comprised of amino acids 50±212 and henceforth referred to as 50±212), contains a triad of invariant acidic amino acids [the D,D(35)E motif] which is required for catalysis. These residues bind two metal atoms that carry out the chemical steps of catalysis. X-ray crystallographic analyses of the avian sarcoma virus (ASV) IN and HIV IN catalytic domains have revealed that they share very high structural homology. Both contain a

mixed -helix -sheet fold found in diverse polynucleotide phosphotransfer enzymes. The C-terminal domain, residues $212±288, resembles the Src homology 3 (SH3) fold and is known to bind DNA strongly but not speci®cally. All three integrase domains are required for full catalytic activity, although the puri®ed catalytic domain can carry out a permissive back reaction called disintegration (Chow et al., 1992; Bushman et al., 1993; Vink et al., 1993). Puri®ed recombinant proteins comprising each domain can form dimers and full-length integrase is known to act as a multimer (Engelman et al., 1993; van Gent et al., 1993). The recent determination of X-ray structures for two-domain fragments containing the catalytic and C-terminal domains has begun to reveal the higher order structure of integrase complexes (Yang et al., 2000; Chen, Krucinski et al., 2000; Chen, Yan et al., 2000). IN protein carries out the initial DNA breaking and joining reactions responsible for the attachment of HIV cDNA to host DNA. Prior to integration, two nucleotides are removed from each 3H -end in the linear cDNA precursor (terminal cleavage) (Roth et al., 1989; Katzman et al., 1989; Sherman & Fyfe, 1990; Craigie et al., 1990). This reaction may be important to the virus by preparing a de®ned substrate for subsequent reaction steps (Patel & Preston, 1994; Miller et al., 1997). The recessed 3H -ends are then joined to protruding 5H ends of breaks made in the target DNA (strand transfer) (Craigie et al., 1990; Bushman et al., 1990; Katz et al., 1990). The remaining DNA strands are then attached, probably by the action of host DNA-repair enzymes, to complete formation of an integrated provirus. The terminal cleavage and strand-transfer reactions can be modeled in vitro by using puri®ed recombinant IN protein. Under simple reaction conditions, puri®ed IN can form a covalent bond between a double-stranded DNA substrate that mimics the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) and another DNA mimicking the integration target. Systematic screening of potential inhibitors has been undertaken using mostly puri®ed IN-based assays. From such screens several IN inhibitors have now been identi®ed, but to date no clinically useful inhibitors have been developed and only a handful display antiviral activity (Hansen et al., 1998; Pommier et al., 1997; Hazuda et al., 2000; King & Robinson, 1998; Reddy et al., 1999). Alternatively, one can identify small molecules that bind to the integrase catalytic domain using X-ray crystallographic analysis of small molecule±integrase complexes and attempt to build up speci®city and af®nity groups into the compound. Where possible, we have used compounds that contain heavy atoms that have useful X-ray absorption properties (anomalous scattering) as the starting material to facilitate inhibitor identi®cation. Here, we describe the crystal structures of 50±212 in complex with tetraphenylarsonium chloride (1) or 3,4-dihydroxyphenyltriphenylarsonium bromide (3). These compounds were found to bind speci®cally at the 50±212 dimer interface in the crystal. Although the mechanism of inhibition is not fully clari®ed, we have shown that one such chemical derivative we synthesized possesses an inhibitory activity with an IC50 in the low micromolar range.

2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Crystallization and structure determination

HIV integrase core domain (50±212) was puri®ed as previously described (Jenkins et al., 1995; Greenwald et al., 1999). Crystals of 50±212 were obtained by vapor diffusion (1:1 mixture with the protein at 10 mg mlÀ1) at 277 K using 15% PEG 8000, 100 mM cacodylic acid pH 6.5, 200 mM (NH4)2SO4, 5 mM DTT, 5 mM MnCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2 as a precipitant (Greenwald et al., 1999), essentially as reported by Dyda et al. (1994). It is known that in this crystallization condition two cysteines (Cys65 and Cys130) are covalently modi®ed by arsenic originating from the cacodylate buffer. The cacodylation causes a local conformational alteration. The size of the crystals was increased by feeding fresh protein into a drop which contained a few large crystals. In this way, we could grow crystals that were over 0.5 mm on a side and Ê diffracted to 2 A on a rotating-anode X-ray source and to Ê at a synchrotron. 1.5 A

The compounds (1) and (3) were introduced into the crystallized protein by soaking the crystals in a solution of cryoprotectant with 2.5 mM compound. The cryoprotectant consisted of the same components as the crystallization solution with the addition of 30% ethylene glycol and the reduction of PEG to 10% and (NH4)2SO4 to 100 mM. The crystals were soaked for 24±72 h and then ¯ash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. Data for the complex of 50±212 with compound (1) were collected at SSRL beamline 1-5 using the

Data for the complex of 50±212 with compound (3) were collected using a Cu K X-ray source on a rotating anode. We used the inversebeam collection strategy to complete the F  and F À anomalous pairs, to reduce systematic errors introduced by data collection and to increase the data redundancy. The data were indexed with DENZO and integrated with SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993). The data were re®ned with REFMAC using PDB entry 1b9d as a starting model (Greenwald et al., 1999). The X-ray data and re®nement statistics are listed in Table 1.

incomplete. The use of anomalous scattering was crucially instrumental to resolving the bound small molecules described below. One strategy for choosing compounds began with the identi®cation of a negatively charged pocket on the protein surface comprising the active site. In an effort to ®ll this pocket, bulky positively charged compounds were soaked with crystals and analyzed by X-ray crystallography. Cationic arsenic compounds were studied, since they are both capable of anomalous scattering and are positively charged.

3.2. X-ray analysis

3. Results
3.1. Inhibitor search strategy

We ®rst sought to identify compounds that bind the integrase surface to provide starting points for inhibitor design. Many compounds were used in soaking crystals of the integrase catalytic domain (residues 50±212), which were then analyzed by X-ray crystallography. For these studies we used two different integrase mutants. One contained the F185K mutant, which improves solubility as previously reported (Jenkins et al., 1996). The second form contained the F185K and W131E mutations. This mutant crystallizes in a different space group (Goldgur et al., 1999). The ®rst small-molecule binding site was identi®ed with compound (1) (Fig. 2) and was only resolvable in the F185K mutant, not the F185K/W131E form. Modi®cation of compound (1) yielded inhibitors, as is discussed below, and one (compound 3) was visualized bound to the same binding site on the protein surface. For these studies, we favored, where possible, inhibitors containing atoms with useful anomalous scattering properties. This facilitates the identi®cation of the inhibitor-binding site, particularly in cases where the occupancy of the site is

The binding site of compound (1) was identi®ed by locating the As atom ®rst in anomalous difference Fourier maps. The (2Fo À Fc) and (F  À F À ) electron-density maps were calculated for this region with the phases from the model without the compound (Fig. 2a). Compound 1 binds at the dimer interface near the C-terminal end of the long helix (extending from residue Ala150 to Ala169) (Fig. 3). These data did not clearly resolve the four tetrahedrally oriented phenyl rings surrounding the As atom. These results indicate that these phenyl rings are either positionally ¯exible or the occupancy of the compound is signi®cantly less than one per site, as re¯ected by their high temperature factors in the re®ned structure. We have not attempted to estimate the fractional occupancy based on the peak height of the electron density. The binding speci®city of (1) appears to be a consequence in part of a strong charge±charge interaction with the carbonyl O atom of Gln168, which is pointing directly towards the arsenic center. Probably as a result, the side-chain atoms of Gln168, which are disordered in the unliganded structure (Greenwald et al., 1999) and thus invisible, became ordered in the presence of (1), making a direct contact with the tip of one of the phenyl rings in (1). In addition, there are two Trp residues (Trp131 and Trp 132) in this pocket that stack with one of the phenyl rings in (1). Compound (1) has a positively charged center which is Ê partially balanced by a counter-ion that is bound 7 A from the As atom in compound (1). Of the two major types of anions present in the crystallization solution, ClÀ and SO2À, ClÀ 4 appears to be more consistent with the observed electron density. We also collected diffraction data on complexes of integrase formed with the other chemical derivatives of (1) described below. X-ray diffraction data from a complex of 50±212 with (3) were collected at Cu K wavelength to a resolution of Ê 2.3 A. At this wavelength, the anomalous signal is too weak to clearly locate the As atom from anomalous difference maps. However, the standard Fo À Fc maps clearly located the arsenic position of (3), placing it in the same location as the As of (1) (Fig. 2b). This is expected since the only difference between the two compounds is the presence in (3) of a catechol group (a phenyl ring with two hydroxyl groups). The positions of the four phenyl rings were less well de®ned than

for compound (1). It was therefore not possible to establish the position of the catechol. Comparison of the two complexes, however, indicates that there are signi®cant differences between the two. In the case of compound (3), binding caused a structural change distant from its binding site (Fig. 4). There are two covalently bound As atoms in this crystal form, resulting from covalent modi®cation of the protein by cacodylate present in the buffer (Dyda et al., 1994). Both covalently bound As atoms are attached to Cys residues that lie in small hydrophobic cavities. The As atoms are bound to Cys65 and Cys130, allowing the position of these side chains to be assessed by monitoring the As signal. The binding of (3) to 50±212 causes the CÐC bond in Cys65 to rotate by about 80 around the CÐS bond. This altered conformation is named the `out' form to distinguish it from the `in' form in the unliganded structure. This rotation causes the covalently bound Ê As atom to change position by 3 A. The occupancy of the cacodylate is approximately 40 and 60% in the in and out positions, respectively. Analysis of ten other data sets (unsuccessful attempts to soak in other inhibitors) showed C65 in the in position only (data not shown).

Only one phenyl ring is shown, as the position of the others was uncertain.

More than 20 small molecules related to (1) were tested for their ability to inhibit the terminal cleavage (TC) and strand-transfer (ST) activities of integrase (Table 2, Fig. 5 and data not shown). Tests used model oligonucleotide substrates mimicking one end of the unintegrated viral DNA and target DNA. Products of integration reactions were separated by electrophoresis and quantitated by PhosphorImager scanner. The IC50 values for the compounds in this series are summarized in Table 2. Compound (1) did not display signi®cant inhibitory activity against integrase. Compound (2), which substitutes the As atom of (1) with phosphorus, also was not inhibitory. Compound (3) differs from (1) by the presence of a catechol ring in place of a phenyl ring. The catechol group has often been often found in compounds identi®ed as integrase inhibitors. Compound (3) did show modest though clear activity against integrase.

Substitution of the arsenic center in compound (3) with phosphorus yielded compound (4), the most active inhibitor in the series. Compound (4) inhibited in the low micromolar range, comparing favorably to other integrase inhibitors in this class. An analog with methoxy groups in place of hydroxyl groups in (4) was completely inactive, indicating the importance of the catechol unit (data not shown). Furthermore, the precise position of the catechol group is important. Addition of a methylene unit between the catechol ring and the P atom of compound (4) yielded an inactive derivative (compound 5). This result shows that small changes in the inhibitor structure can produce large variations in the biological properties. As a control, the active compounds were tested for activity against the MCV topoisomerase enzyme (Hwang et al., 1998) and found to be inactive, demonstrating speci®city for integrase.
3.4. Inhibition of isolated catalytic domain

Inhibition of 50±212 was also tested, since this is the form of the enzyme studied by crystallography. For tests of the inhibition of the catalytic domain, the disintegration assay was used (Chow et al., 1992). The substrate for the disintegration assay contained branched DNA substrates mimicking the product of integration. Disintegration by the catalytic domain cleaved off the viral DNA end and resealed the target DNA. The results of disintegration assays testing inhibition of 50±212 are shown in Fig. 5(b). Substrates were end labeled on the target strand, so disintegration produces a longer DNA product (arrow on ®gure). Compounds (1) and (2) did not display detectable inhibitory activity. Compounds (3) and (4) did inhibit, with compound (4) displaying the lower IC50. Thus the rank order of inhibitors was the same with full-length integrase and 50±212, though the IC50 values were higher with 50±212. This is probably because the disintegration reaction catalyzed by 50±212 has been found to be less sensitive to inhibitors than terminal cleavage and strand transfer in several previous studies (Reddy et al., 1999; Farnet et al., 1998). In our X-ray studies of compounds (1) and (3), the 50±212 F185K form modi®ed by arsenic (from the cacodylate buffer) was used because only this crystal form permitted the bound inhibitor to be identi®ed. Previous studies have suggested that the presence of the covalently bound As atoms at Cys65 and

Cys130 distort the positions of several enzyme side chains, raising the question of whether the structure observed was biologically relevant (Goldgur et al., 1999). We therefore examined whether the cacodylate-modi®ed form of 50±212 retained disintegration activity (Fig. 5d). The 50±212 F185K enzyme was pre-incubated with 100 mM cacodylate and 10 mM DTT for 30 min and the disintegration activity was assayed. Fig. 5(d) shows that the disintegration activity remains intact despite cacodylate treatment.

4. Discussion
4.1. Small molecules that bind the 50±212 dimer interface

Here, we describe the identi®cation of compounds that bind at the dimer interface of the HIV-1 integrase catalytic domain. Ê The binding pocket is $5 A deep and displays an overall negative charge. Although compound (1) occupied the dimer interface site, it was not inhibitory. In an effort to generate an inhibitor, we converted one of the phenyl rings to a catechol, a group often found in integrase inhibitors. This yielded an inhibitor (3), which displayed modest potency (IC50 = 150 mM). X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that compound (3) bound to the same dimer interface site as compound (1). Further derivatives were then synthesized with the goal of increasing potency. The most signi®cant improvement came with substituting the As atom with phosphorus (4), which yielded a roughly tenfold decrease in IC50. Given that the active site of integrase is rather ¯at, this dimer interface pocket represents a potential new target for inhibitory ligands. Why does compound (3) inhibit integrase, whereas compound (1), apparently bound to the same site, does not? Our crystallographic and enzymatic analysis cannot rule out the possibility that the binding of the compounds at the dimer interface is a crystallographic artifact and that binding to other unidenti®ed sites on the protein or on the protein±DNA comFigure 5 plexes could be directly Inhibition of HIV-1 integrase in vitro by arsenic-containing compounds.

Other mechanisms are also conceivable. For example, the catechol moiety might bind a metal atom, a known property of this group, thereby forming a larger `knob' on the protein surface that could sterically interfere with activity. A previous study led to the suggestion of such a mechanism for catecholcontaining integrase inhibitors based on other data (Farnet et al., 1998). Two observations suggest the compounds (3) and (4) may inhibit assembly of integration complexes. First, the catechol derivatives did not inhibit reactions with preassembled preintegration complexes isolated from infected cells (data not shown). Second, we ®nd that the IC50 is increased twofold to fourfold if IN is preassembled with DNA substrates prior to adding (3) or (4) (data not shown). We thank people in the groups of A. McCammon, J.

4.2. Exploiting anomalous scattering in inhibitor development

Compounds that contained atoms that exhibit an anomalous scattering signal facilitated the localization of the binding site on 50±212. The results emphasize the usefulness of anomalous scatterers in screening for bound ligands (see Hendrickson, 1991 for detailed discussion). This is particularly useful in early stages of study in which weak signals arising from partial occupancy are often encountered. In our experiments, the presence of anomalous signal was crucial to locate the As center of the compounds. The inclusion of an anomalous scatterers such as As, Se or Br can help to locate the compound with less ambiguity in initial crystallographic screening of inhibitors. We are attempting to exploit this approach systematically by assembling a library of compounds containing anomalous scattering atoms to facilitate the identi®cation of small-molecule binding sites in the course of crystallographic analyses.

4.3. Three binding sites for integrase inhibitors

This study reports the third inhibitor-binding site on the surface of integrase proteins identi®ed to date: a binding site at the catalytic domain dimer interface. Previously, Lubkowski et al. (1998) have reported a structure of the avian sarcoma virus integrase catalytic domain complexed with an inhibitor bound to a site near the catalytic pocket. Goldgur et al. (1999) reported another structure of the HIV catalytic domain containing a small molecule bound to a part of the active site. Some caution is warranted in interpreting data from all three complexes, since the inhibitors in each case make contacts to multiple integrase monomers in the crystal lattice and these potentially non-biological contacts may in¯uence the conformation observed (Striffer et al., 2000). However, these data taken together suggest that it may be possible to develop inhibitors of integrase that bind to multiple sites. Potentially, the HIV virus would need independent mutations in the integrase coding region to evade inhibition by molecules binding to each site. This raises the exciting hope that it may be possible to develop multiple combination therapy of integrase to add to the antiviral armamentarium.
