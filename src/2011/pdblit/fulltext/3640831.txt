Three isomorphous heavy-atom derivatives have been used to calculate a 2.5 A resolution electron density map of tosyl-elastase at pH 5.0, from which an accurate atomic model has been constructed. Atomic co-ordinates measured from this model have been refined using model building, real-space refinement and energy minimization programs. The three-dimensional conformation of the polypeptide chain is described in terms of conformational angles, hydrogenbonding networks and the environment of different types of amino acid side-chain. Difference Fourier calculation of the high resolution structure of native elastase at pH 5.0 shows it to be virtually identical to that of the tosyl derivative, except near the tosyl group. The conformation of the catalytically important residues in native elastase is very similar to that of native or-chymotrypsin, except for the orientation of the active centre serine oxygen. The significance of important structural similarities and differences between these two enzymes is discussed. Elastase contains 25 internal water molecules which play an important role in stabilizing the active conformation of the enzyme. Many of these water molecules are in identical positions to those found in the interior of cr-chymotrypsin.

1. Introduction
The determination of the three-dimensional structure of porcine pancreatic elastase at 3.5 B resolution (Watson et al., 1970; Shotton & Watson, 1970a,b; Shotton et al.. 1971) has permitted comparison with the atomic structures of two other pancreatic serine proteinases, a-chymotrypsin (Matthews et al., 1967; Sigler et al., 1968; Birktoft et al., 1969,197O; Birktoft & Blow, 1972; Tulinsky et al., 1973a,b; Vandlen & Tulinsky, 1973), and trypsin (Stroud et al., 1974), giving a deep insight into the unity and diversity of structure and mechanism which exists within one enzyme family.

enzymes possess a common molecular architecture. apparently shared by serim proteinases from non-mammalian species (Olsen et al., 1970; McLachlan & Shobton. 1971; Johnson & Smillie, 1972; Delbaere et al., 1975) in which the essentia,l residues at the active site occupy identical spatial environments to provide a common catalytic mechanism, while differences elsewhere in the molecules contribute to the variations in substrate specificity. To enable a more precise comparison to be made with the other serine proteinases. we have extended our structure determination of elastase to 2.5 A resolution. In a preliminary communication (Sawyer et al., 1973), we reported the construction of a skeletal model of tosyl-elastase which accurately fitted an electron density map of this derivative calculated at 2.5 A resolution, and listed the unrefined atomic co-ordinates measured from that model. We now wish to describe the details of this high-resolution structure determination, and to report the results of computer refinement of the tosyl-elastase atomic co-ordinates, of difference Fourier calculations to determine the structure of native elastase and of detailed comparisons made between the molecular structures of elastase and a-chymotrypsin. To facilitate further study and comparison. the contents of many Tables and Figures in this paper have intentionally been made to resemble those in Birktoft & Blow's (1972) report of the atomic structure of tosyl-xchymotrypsin.

2. Methods
(a) Crystallization and

derivative

preparation

elastase was prepared from Trypsin l-300, an acetone powder of porcine pancreas (Nutritional Biochemicals, Cleveland, Ohio), according to the procedure of Shotton (1971). Orthorhombic crystals of native elastase, space group P2,2,2, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, were grown at 2°C or at 20°C by the daily addition of a small volume (2 ~1 to 10 ~1) of 1 M-sodium sulphate to 0.5-ml portions of a solution of elastase (20 mg/ml in 10 mM-sodium acetate, pH 5.0), until crystallization occurred at final sodium sulphate concentrations ranging between 5 and 80 mM (Shotton et al., 1968). Solutions were freed from nucleation particles by centrifugation, and crystallization was carried out in small flat-bottomed, acid-washed glass vials which permitted convenient microscopic examination and subsequent handling of the crystals. Crystals of the inhibited derivatives, p-toluenesulphonyl elastase (tosyl-elastase) and p-chloromercuribanzenesulphonyl elastase, were prepared following inhibition of native elastase solutions by tosyl fluoride and pCMBSt fluoride, respectively, as reported by Watson et al. (1970), except that freeze-drying of the dialyzed inhibited enzyme was often omitted. In the new procedure, solutions of elastase (20 mg/ml) were inhibited, dialyzed against 10 mlcr-sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and then centrifuged to remove precipitated microcryst,als of the derivative. The clear saturated solutions of the inhibited enzyme thus obtained were assayed to ensure complete (> 98%) inhibition, and used directly for growing crystals, somewhat higher final concentrations of sodium sulphate (40 to 200 XnM) being required to initiate crystallization than for the native enzyme. This was especially true for pCMBS-elastase, which at these higher salt concentrations often formed crystals elongated along their c axis rather than their b axis (Shotton, 1969). Selected crystals with a maximum dimension of 0.5 mm for precession photography or 1.0 mm for diffractometer data collection were transferred to a standard working solution of 1.2 M-sodium sulphate, 0.05 M-sodium acetate (pH 5.0).

For the 2.5 A% resolution structure determination, we utilized the same 4 derivatives of elastase previously used in the 3.5 A structure determination (Watson et al., 1970). Tosyl-elastase was again used as the parent compound, for the reasons described previously, with pCMBS-elaataae, uranyl tosyl-elastaae and uranyl ~CMBS-elastase forming 2 single-site and 1 double-site isomorphous heavy-atom derivatives, respectively. Such was the quality of these derivatives that excellent high resolution phase information was obtainable using only 2 independent heavy-atom sites, that of the mercury atom covalently attached by the benzenesulphonyl group to the y-oxygen atom of the active centre serine residue, Ser195t. of the two pCMBS-elastase derivat,ives, and that of a single many1 iotl bound non-covalently at the uranyl loop (residues 66 to 83; Shotton & Watson, 197Oh) of the 2 many1 derivatives. For each derivative a complete 3-dimensional set of X-ray diffraction data between 3.64 A and 2.50 A resolution was measured with a computer-controlled Hilger and Watts 4-circle diffractometer using CuKa radiation, utilizing the ordinate analysis data collection procedure previously described (Watson et al., 1970). Two crystals of each derivative were used to collect each high resolution data set. Reciprocal lattice layers z = 0 t,o 9 (5706 intensity measurements) were collected from crystal 1 and layers z = 10 to 20 (5500 intensity measurements) from crystal 2. Bijvoet pairs of reflexions were collected within minutes of one another, and data sets from the different derivatives were collected in the same order to minimize errors in,each of the various scaling procedures. Each crystal was irradiated for about 100 h, during which time the mean intensity of 3 high-resolution axial reference reflexions fell by less than 10%.

The measured X-ray intensities of each data set were corrected for background radiation intensity, no attempt being subsequently made to remeasure the small number of very weak reflexions rejected from each data set at this stage because the apparent peaks of these reflexions lay near the edges of the collection scan.

The data from each crystal were first checked for internal consistency by comparing t I I$' measurements of individual Bijvoet pairs, a very small number of pairs (6 or less from cacll crystal) being rejected because the differences between members of the pairs were greatc>r than would be expected from anomalous scattering effects.

After averaging the structure amplitudes of members of each Bijvoet pair, the 2 nonoverlapping parts of the tosyl-elastase high resolution data set collected from tosylelastase crystals 1 and 2 were combined by scaling them to the tosyl-elastase scaling crystal data set. Reflexions between 3.64 A and 2.50 A resolution were then selected from the combined data sets to form the complete tosyl-elastase high-resolution parent data set of 5448 independent reflexions, while those with spacings greater than 3.64 A resolut,ion were used to bring the data employed in our 3.5 A structure determination on to the same scale aa the new high resolution data.

against the tosyl-elastase parent data set, bringing these data all on to a common scale. Dat#a from crystals 1 and 2 were then combined to give a complete 3-dimensional data set between the resolution limits of 3.64 A and 2.50 A for each derivative. Table 2 shows the values of the scale and temperature factors required to equate the heavy-atom derivative and the parent data sets, and lists the mean observed differences in structure amplitudes between parent and derivative data. Two-dimensional difference Patterson syntheses calculated from these high resolut'ion data sets were unambiguously interpretable for all 3 heavy-atom derivatives, confirming tile heavy atom positions determined by our previous study at 3.5 A resolution (Watsorl et Cl/.. 1970).

The parameters derived from the last. cyelr of refinement are given in Tables 3 and 4. For subseqursnt Fourier calculations, anomalous dispersion data were included in tire phase determination (North, 1965), using the sense which we had previously shown to gl\~x that correct structural enantiomorpl~ (Watsotl et al., 1970).

being virtually identical to that of the contributing single-site derivative. Inclusion of incorrect anomalous scattering data in this situation favours one of these two possible choices, thus automatically increasing the figure of merit, but at the same time increasing the lack of closure of the phase triangle. As with the 3.5 A resolution data (Watson et al., 1970), this effect is particularly marked for pCMBS-elastase, owing to the greater weighting given to the anomalous contribution from the uranyl ion. In contrast, Table 4 shows that when the anomalous scattering data were included correctly in the refinement, there was both a large increase in the figure of merit and a significant decrease in the lack of closure of the phase triangles for all 3 derivatives. Following least-squares refinement using selected medium intensity data, the final heavy-atom parameters were used to calculate the centroid phases (Blow & Crick, 1959) of all 5448 independent tosyl-elastase highresolution structure amplitudes, incorporating the anomalous dispersion data (North, 1965). The ratio of the mean heavy-atom structure amplitude to the lack of closure of the phase triangles obtained from phasing the complete data set was greater than 2.5: 1 for each heavy-atom derivative (Table 4), showing that all 3 derivatives were providing accurate high resolution phase information. The mean figure of merit averaged over all high resolution reflexions was 0.858, corresponding to a mean error in phase angle of 31". The achievement of such good phasing was aided by the essentially full occupancy of the heavy-atom sites and the high degree of isomorphism between derivatives. In addition,

The variations of the mean parent and heavyatom structure amplitudes, and of the accuracy of the phase determination as a function of resolution, are shown in Fig. 1, from which it can be seen that the figure of merit, m, is almost constant over the entire resolution range. Attempts to extend the refinement of the data used to calculate the 3.5 A resolution electron density map of tosyl-elastase did not lead to any improvement in the phase determination. Consequently, these data were used directly, after first scaling them against the low resolution scaling data set, to bring them on to a common scale with the high resolution data. The values of c and 6 used for this process, defined as in Table 2, were 1.581 and - 0.432, respectively. Reflexions with spacing less than 3.64 A were eliminated from these scaled data, which were then combined directly with the high resolution data to give a complete set of 8170 accurately phased structure amplitudes between 16 A and 2..5 k resolution for crystalline tosyl-elastase at pH 5.0t. t The tosyl-elastase ERS4 set of atomic co-ordinates and torsion angles, and a table of structure factors giving h, k, 1, IPI, na and CLfor the complete tosyl-elastase data set used to compute the 2.5 A resolution Fourier, have been deposited with the British Library Lending Division, Boston Spa, Yorkshire LS23 7BQ, England, as Supplementary Publication Number SUP 40012.

of the comparator, and using Kendrew-Watson skeletal components (Cambridge Repetition Engineers, Greens Road, Cambridge, England), a new atomic model of tosyl-elastase was built which accurately fitted the 2.5 A resolution electron densit'y map. The map itself was very clear and unambiguously interpretable. As in the 3.5 A resolution electron density map, the single polypept'ide chain of each elastase molecule is represented by an unbroken column of high electron densit'y. cross-linked by four prominent disulphide bridges. In contrast to the previous map. clearly defined main-chain protrusions, with slightly greater elect'ron density tha,n that representing the cc-carbon and main-chain nitrogen atoms (see Fig. 2). indicatr the positions and orientations of all the peptide carbonyl groups in the molecule except for those of Glp219, Gly36B and Ser36C and that of the carboxyl terminal residue Asn245. where the electron density is somewhat diffuse. Where carbonyl oxygen atoms lie within hydrogen-bonding distance of hydrogen bond donors. the electron density of the acceptor and donor atoms is often connected by a single contour. The small "insertion" loop (Shotton & Hartley. 1970) comprising residues Ser36A. Gly36B, Ser36C and Ser37, projects from the molecular surface and has no contacts with neighhouring molecules. As in the 3.6 A resolution map, bhis loop is bhe only region where the main-chain electron density is weaker and less well-defined than for t,he rest of t#he molecule, thus indicating an additional degree of thermal motion. While the general position of the side chains and t'he course of the main chain through this loop is clear, difficulty was experienced in obtaining a good fit between t)he model components and t'he electron density for residues Gly36B and Ser36C, whose listed co-ordinettes cannot therefore be treated wit,h the same level of confidence as t,hosft from the rest of the molecule. ljensity representing the atoms of amino acid side-chains can be clearly seen branching at regular intervals from the a-carbon atom positions on the main chain. Ma,rked improvement in side-chain resolution over the 3.5 A electron density map is also clearly apparent, dimpling of six-membered rings and forking of branched sidechains being for the most part obvious. The electron density of the carboxyl terminal a-helix is ext'remely well resolved and has a central hole running throughout its length. while the sulphur atoms of each disulphide bridge are just resolved from one anot'her and appear at twice the main-chain densit#y. The sulphate ion. SU-1, which at pH 5.0 is bound between the side chains of Arg145 and Arg230 of adjacent molecules (Shotton PI nl.. 1971). the &phony1 moiety of the tosyl inhibitor atbached to Ser195. and the sulphur at'oms of t'he two methionine residues in the molecule are equally prominent features in the map. In addition to the electron density of the polypeptide chain? the tosyl group and t'h(b hound sulphato ion SU- 1, the map shows many other small isolated peaks which were nob obvious in the 3.5 A resolution map. These peaks are often as dense as the main chain it)self and are located in the intermolecular spaces in the crystal latticr. at the enzyme surface and also buried within small internal cavities formed by the folding of the elastase polypeptide chain, and are interpreted as representing solvent molerules. The isola,ted internal peaks all make contact with hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. While it might be possible to confuse the electron density of a loos~~ly bound disordered acetate or sulphate ion with that of a tightly bound sodium ion 01 water molecule. we think that most' of these peaks represent trapped water molecules, sinc,c t,here are no compensating charged groups.

During the model-building procedure, which was greatly facilitated by the clarity with which carbonyl protrusions and side-chain conformations appeared in the map, most of the amino acid residues could be identified from their electron density alon?, without reference to the chemically determined amino acid sequence (Shotton & Hartley, 1970,1973). It is known from this sequence study that Asn186 is very susceptible to deamidation, and indeed the electron density at this point, which shows the terminal atoms of the side chain of residue 186 to be within hydrogenbonding distance of two obligate hydrogen bond donors, the c-nitrogen atom of Arg188A and the main-chain nitrogen atom of Va1187, suggests that, in the crystal, this side chain is present in its deamidated, free carboxyl form. In subsequent refinements this amino acid was therefore classified as aspartic acid. In the case of eight surface residues, the extremities of their long polar side chains are not represented by electron density in the map and are thus assumed to be in free rotation beyond their fl or y carbon atoms, while for a further t'en residues the sidechain density is very weak or diffuse. These side chains were positioned in the model in a, fully extended conformation, and the co-ordinates derived for their constituent atoms are indicated in Table 6 by an asterisk. A few other side chains had diffusca but interpretable electron density. For all other residues, electron density representing t)he entire side chain is present and well-resolved. For the most part these side chains are in a fully staggered conformation, but there arc a few cases where, in ordtxr to tit bhe model components to the electron density, the CY atom was placed in the eclipsed position facing HQ (x for Ca-Co bond of approx. - 120"). Allowing for such irregularit'ies encountered during model building, full details of which are presented in Table 7. our interpretation of the 2.5 a electron density map of tos.yl-elastase is in harmon) with and confirms the chemically determined amino acid sequence.

4. Measurement

of Atomic

Co-ordinates

To measure atomic co-ordinates, we used a simplified version of the device described by Salemme & Fehr (1972), in which we replaced the Perspex sheets in the opt'ical comparator with a point light source which could be positioned anywhere behind t'he half-silvered mirror by movement along three mutually perpendicular, graduated axes. By bringing this point light source into coincidence with the reflected image of any atom in the model, the co-ordinates of t'hat atom could be recorded. This method of recording co-ordinates eliminates many of the errors and difficulties associated with the conventional "ruler and plumb-line" procedure, and to some degree automaticall> corrects for inaccuracies which may be introduced during model building by distortions in the mirror. However, a problem of depth perception in the direction perpendicular to the mirror, both while building the model and measuring its co-ordinates, is intrinsic to an optical comparator and produces a systematic variation in t'he accuracy of the measurement in this dire&ion. We have been able to estimate ttlcl error using a model building program (Diamond, 1966) designed to fit amino acid residues wit'h standard bond lengths and angles to the measured co-ordinates. It was found that the mean error in the x-co-ordinates measured by our system increases from approximately 0.06 A for those atoms closest to the mirror to twice t'hat valuca for those furthest away. In a separate publication (Sawyer et al., 1973) we havt: illustrated this variation in the accuracy of the x-co-ordinate and have tabulated the unrefined atomic co-ordinates of tosyl-elastase. measured directly from the modcll. This published data set was used for the structure refinements described below.

5. Refinement

of Atomic

Co-ordinates

The co-ordinates measured from the model, Bl, were used as input to a mod~~l I)uiltling program (Diamond, 1966) to check for any gross inaccuracies and to generatr :I set of "standardized" co-ordinates for later refinement. T(G), hut not W> was allo\vetl to vary at this stage and the mean value for the 240 atoms \vas 110.4". The r.m.s. difference of the measured data from those of the "standardized" model, Ml, \vas 0.188 A, with only a few side chains giving rise to differences in excess of 0.5 A (SCV below). The first cycle of real space refinement (Diamond, 1971,1974), resulting in coordinate set RSl was made using a molten zone of five residues and a margin length of one peptide unit. 4, 4, x, w, 7 and 19 were given relative weights of 3.7, 3.7. 3.2. 0.5, 0.3 and O-1, respectively. A value for the atom radius (1.2 w) considerably smaller than could be justified on the basis of the electron density map was chosen in order to avoid instability in ill-defined regions of the electron density map. No unduly large movement was indicated at this stage and internal regions containing His57 and tosyl-Ser195 were subsequently refined with the radial constraint removed, between cycles RX1 and RS2. This calculation gave a mean radius for the atoms included (~340) of I.68 a & 0.21 8, with few values greater than 1.9 A. The expe&cd increase in effective radius with distance from the Ca t,owards side-chain terminal atoms was observed (see also Diamond, 1974). The mean radius of all atoms in Asp194 was 1.45 A f 0.06 d, as might be expected when one ion pair and t'hree hydrogen bonds to main-chain atoms help to locate this residue. In subsequent refinement. t8hc effective atomic radii for all atoms were t'aken to be 1.68 A. The next full cycle of real space refinement, from co-ordinate set RSI, produced set RS2 from which a difference electron density map was calculat'ed. This map, in conjunction with the wire model, was used to check that atomic shifts generated by the refinement were consistent with an improvement in the fit to the electron density. Some obvious discrepancies showed up in those side chains which had produced large apparent errors when using the model building program. These discrepancies arose from the computational model building which produced an incorrect fit for a felt extended side chains. Some atoms moved away from centres of density and these were critically examined before the implied shifts were accepted. The movement of neighbouring groups, especially those associated with the branched side chains. occasionally proved contradictory. In one or two places t,here seemed to be too much density in the map and, as a result, the positioning of the wire model had been rather unsatisfactory. For example, x1 of the side chain of Thr96 had moved 49" but appeared to fit the density equally well. Similarly, after refinement the plane of the peptidr unit 219-220 seemed to be roughly 40" from the longer axis of its density. Alterations deemed necessary were applied to the co-ordinate set RS2, using modifications to the real space refinement program which allow intervention in the refinement procedure without causing any loss of chain continuity. With these new program facilities, positional movements can be specified as an alteration in coordinates or as a change in angle parameters, either absolutely or relatively, and can be acted upon with or without reference to the elect'ron density. Required shifts are edited into the input list together with a negative number. the product of whose modulus and the number of electrons in the atom is the weight used for the refinement. Since the numbers in the relevant field of the co-ordinate list are posit.ive unless

negated by intervention, the atoms are driven towards their input positions and thus do not move. Those with negative numbers, however, are driven towards their new positions. It is necessary to decouple neighbouring atoms from their current positions in order that they may take up suitable sites between the fixed parts of the moleculrb and those being moved. To do this without relaxing the chain constraints, it is suBicient to specify a very small weight for these neighbouring atoms, and to reposition a side chain decoupling need go no further than its own 0. Main-chain movements require additional freedom for at least two residues on either side of the "offending" residue. A program option, allowing changes in angle parameter to be acted upon before the refinement proper begins, allows major conformational alterations t,o be made simultaneously with the refinement against the electron density. Using these program modifications, major repositioning was made to the side chains of Arg36, Arg61, Glu80 and Lys87, the peptide bond 219-220 and the distal ends? of the disulphide bridges. Smaller, somewhat tentative movements were made to several residues and some 20 external water molecules were included in the refinement. Furt.her cyeIes of refinement against the electron density, RS3 and RS4, were carried out over those regions which had been modified. The major structural alterations were confirmed but the smaller, more tentative structural changes were invariably reversed, in agreement with the observation of Huber et ccl. (1974) that it is virtually impossible to identify minor inaccuracies at this resolution. Some small improvcments occurred near the disulphide bridges, since correcting the distal CQ atoms. previously fixed during refinement, allowed the neighbouring residues to take up better positions, but these movements were less than 0.3 A. The resulting co-ordinates, RS4, were further refined by the energy minimisation procedure of Levitt (Levitt & Lifson, 1969; Levitt, 1974) in order to relieve any undue strain imposed by the real space refinement. The r.m.s. deviation of co-ordinate set ERS4 from RS4 was O-211 A. In all, 85 atoms moved by more than 0.4 8, all of which were in external regions of the molecule and, in general, poorly defined. One notable shift was that, of Thr96, which reverted to its built position some 40" away from that given by the real space refinement. In this new co-ordinate set some 65 close contacts (<3*0 A for C-C, <2.8 A for C-O and C-N, and <2.6 A for O-O, O-N and N-N) occurred, of which 24 involved adjacent residues, 27 involved water molecules and I1 were "short" hydrogen bonds. A final check on co-ordinate set ERS4 was made using the real space refinement program by allowing only the scale factor and atomic radii to refine. Of the refined radii, 166 were greater than 2.0 8, with 49 of them at the 2.5 A limit. In general, these atoms were located on the surface of the molecule where the refinement procedure ha.d increased the effective radii in an attempt to compensate for the lack of elect.ron density. Table 5 contains a summary of the refinement procedure. The large increase in r.m.s. shift between RS2 and RS3 reflects the repositioning of the various side chains, as do the changes in R and C, which indicate a worsening fit to the electron density map. Changes in R and C also occur between sets RS4 and ERS4, where the energy minimisation procedure relaxes the molecule without reference to the elect,ron density map. This is mirrored in the lowering offs and the increase in a(Ap). We feel

6. Assignment

of Hydrogen

Bonds

The 3.5 A resolution electron density map of tosyl-elastase permitted only wide generalizations to be made about possible hydrogen bonding networks within the molecule. In the 2.5 A resolution electron density map the positions of almost all hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups are well-defined, and hydrogen bonds can be assigned with some degree of confidence. Table 7t lists the hydrogen bonds which are judged to be present in crystalline tosyl-elastase, together with the intermolecular hydrogen bonds important for stabilizing the crystal lattice. This Table also identifies hydrogen bonds which are considered to be weak, either because they were unduly long (>3*2 A) or because the angular alignment of the bonding groups was poor (T(H, 0, C)<lOO'), and those tentatively assigned to groups not fully resolved in t,he map which have been positioned by model building alone. Most of the polar groups located on the surface of the elastase molecule point out into the interstitial solution and do not make hydrogen bonds with other groups on the same or neighbouring molecules. We presume that they bond in an irregular manner to disordered water molecules and solute ions. However, about 100 of the surface polar groups are within hydrogen bonding distance of one of the many clearly defined non-protein peaks visible in the map near the surface of the elastase molecule. The hydrogen bonds made to these groups which, with the exception of the prominent sulphate ion that forms a salt bridge between Arg145 and Arg230 of adjacent molecules, are assumed to be water molecules (see Table 7 and Section 9, below). Most of the internal polar groups form good hydrogen bonds either with other protein groups or with one or more of the 25 water molecules which lie internally between the folds of the elastase polypeptide chain in positions inaccessible to free solvent. These internal water molecules serve an important stabilizing role by forming hydrogen bonds with otherwise unsatisfied buried polar groups and are discussed in more detail in section 9, below. Despite the presence of these water molecules, there remain ten amido and eight carbonyl groups occupying internal positions in the molecule, which can be seen in the electron density map to be unable to form satisfactory hydrogen bonds with other main-chain or side-chain groups (see Table 7). For example, one of these eight carbonyl groups, that of Leul60, is pointing into a hydrophobic pocket and appears to be the only unsatisfied hydrogen bond donor or acceptor group in that region of the molecule. In a thorough examination of amide interactions, Hagler & Lifson (1974) have shown that interlayer packing arrangements involving anti-parallel carbonyl groups can more than compensate for the lack of intra-layer hydrogen bonds. It is perhaps not surprising therefore to find that CO-160 is antiparallel to CO-136 with a separation of about 3.8 A. A second similar arrangement exists between CO-132 and Cod"-164, and the main-chain
t The IUPAC-IUB (1970) nomenclature conventions are followed throughout t,his paper. In t,hr Tables the Latin equivalmt,s of Greek supnrscipt,s are used for clarity, 7 being transliterated as EH rather than H to avoid confusion with the symbol for hydrogen, and the residue numbers identifying atoms and groups are hyphenated (e.g. CO-143), rather t,han parenthesized (e.g. CO(143)) as recommended in the IUPAC-IUB conventions.

Hydrogen bonds are mentioned without comment if bot,h their length and orientation appear reasonable. Where a hydrogen bond appears probable on stereo-chemical grounds, but the distance calculated from the co-ordinates exceeds 3.2 A, the distance is given. Entries followed by a question mark in parentheses represent hydrogen bonds with atoms positioned by model building, for which the electron density is diffuse or weak. The classification I (internal), E (external), or S (surface) has been made with reference to the native enzyme, in the absence of the tosyl group, as follows: I, inaccessible to external water, although possibly accessible to internally bound water molecules; S, in the case of side chains, only a portion of the side chain is accessible to external water; in the case of main-chain amide and carbonyl groups, these are on the surface and probably accessible to external water; E, clearly projecting from molecular surface and accessible to external water. All cases where an int,ernal hydrogen bond donor or acceptor appears unable to participate in any hydrogen bond are discussed under the heading Comments. Entries are mado in t.he Table for external and surface hydrogen bond donors and acceptors only where these atoms clearly participate in hydrogen bonds with other protein atoms or with bound solvent molecules which are visible in the map. The 25 internal water molecules are arbitrarily numbered IW-1 to IW-25, while ext,ernal water molecules which can bo clearly seen in the electron density map to be hydrogen-bonded to the enzyme arc indicated by EW, and are numbered only if they are directly hydrogen-bonded to 2 or more protein atoms in t.he same or neighbouring molecules. Atoms of neighbouring elastase molecules in the crystal lattice involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonds are shown in parentheses. SIT-1 is a bound sulphate ion discussed in the text, whose co-ordinates are given in Table 14A. Residues in capitals are homologous between olantase and chrymotrypnin-A (Shotton C Hartley, 1970).

The conformation of a polypeptide main chain may conveniently he described it1 terms of the dihedral angles (&,b) which relate the planes of successive peptide bonds to the Ca atoms through which t'hey are linked (Venkatachalam, 1968). The conformational angles for tosyl-elastase corresponding to the final co-ordinate set ERM are listed in Table 8.

Both co-ordinate sets RS2 and RS4 produce a spread of values similar to those reported by RirktoR & Blow (1972) for a-chymotrypsin but significantly wider than those presented for elastase in Figure 4. The elastase p-branched residues have a slightly smaller mean value than the remainder but only the proline residues (114.1") appear to have values of T(C") which differ significantly from the mean of 112.7". The torsion angle about the peptide bond, W, was allowed to vary in all refinement steps following computational model building. A histogram of the final values is

Previous studies revealed a great similarity to exist between the polypeptide chain conformations of elastase and cc-chymotrypsin (Shotton & Watson, 1970a,b), as had been predicted from their amino acid sequence homologies. Now that both enzymes have been studied at high resolution, more detailed comparisons are possible. Following the least-squares procedure described by McLachlan (1972), the ERS4 set of co-ordinates was compared with set EA3 of tosyl-or-chymotrypsin (Birktoft & Blow, 1972). The matrix below was obtained by superimposing all common mainchain and side-chain atoms, between residues 16 to 145 and 149 to 245. This matrix, whilst perhaps not the best obtainable for the active site region alone, suffers least from any subjective decisions and has been used for all equivalence operations described in this paper -0.816 -0.269 0.511 O-367 -0.925 0.099

The r.m.s. difference between main-chain atoms in elastase and chymotrypsin is 1.80 A, with the major differences located round sections where the insertions and deletions occur. Figure 5 shows the elastase polypeptide chain in the same orientation as that of a-chymotrypsin shown in Figure 12 of Birktoft & Blow (1972). Despite the

The molecule has the same orientation as that of a-chymotrypsin in Fig. 12 of Birktoft & Blow (1972). Bonds on either side of insertions in the elastase sequence, relative to that of a-chymotrypsin (Shotton & Hartley, 1970), are hatched. Residue 146 is a deletion in elastase. Disulphide bonds are stippled. Viewpoint, (- 12.2, - 12.4, 96), centre of projection plane (-5.6, 26.6, 39.7).

close structural similarities, these enzymes exhibit only 39% identity (51% homology?) in their amino acid sequence (Shotton & Hartley, 1970). The sequence differences are largely confined to external loops, within which are found most of the "insertions" in the elastase sequence relative to that of u-chymotrypsin, while the homologous residues are mostly located in the internal regions of each molecule. where they provide common hydrophobia nuclei of highly stabilized conformation,
t Homologous residues are those which are identical or chemically similar to their counterparts in corresponding positions along the polypeptide chain of another serine proteinase. Chemical similarity is defined as Arg = Lys, Asp = Glu, Asn = Gln, Asp = Asn, Glu = Gln, Ser == Thr, Val = Ile, Ile = Leu and Phe = Tyr = Trp (Shotton & Hartley, 1970).

Because the pancreatic serine proteinases share a common structural plan, descriptions of the tertiary structures of these molecules will inevitably bear many similarities.

the common features of these three molecules, although emphasis is given to specific structural differences which exist between elastase and a-chymotrypsin. The elastase molecule is composed of two distinct halves which lie in intimate contact, and which are joined covalently in the vicinity of residue 120 where the single polypeptide chain of necessity passes from one half to the other. Hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions in the contact region hold together these two halves, which both participate in forming the catalytic and substrate binding sites on the enzyme's surface. The molecule is further stabilized by two surface "transmolecular straps" (Stroud et al., 1971) formed by the N-terminal region and C-terminal u-helical "tail". which fold over from opposite sides of the molecule to make various favourable contacts and non-covalent bonds with the surfaces of the C-terminal and N-terminal halves of the molecule, respectively (see Fig. 5).

The plot represents the molecular vectors between all of the a-carbon atoms and shows the striking similarity of the two structures. The Figure also shows approximate mirror symmetry about the line running from the top right to the lower left of the diagram. This confirms previous observations by Shotton & Watson (1970) and Nishikawa & Ooi (1974) that these molecules can be regarded as having a main-chain fold from the middle to the carboxyl terminus which is similar to that of the first half of the molecule when traced from the centre towards the amino terminus. Figure 7 is an alternative pictorial representation of the elastase molecule showing the distance of each Cm from the active centre. In this Figure, approximate mirror symmetry can be seen between right and left-hand halves of the diagram.

Within the N-terminal half of the molecule, the polypeptide chain is folded in long loops to form an irregular, b-pleated sheet (Pauling & Corey, 1951) composed of six antiparallel chains stabilized by hydrogen bonds. The sheet has a distinct righthanded twist (Chothia, 1973) and is curved back on itself in such a way as to create a closed cylindrical surface. Not all the hydrogen bonds typical of a regular B-sheet are made, and the cylinder (cylinder 1, Fig. 8(a)) is rather irregular and somewhat

Within the C-terminal half of the molecule, another six antiparallel stretches of chain form a topologically similar cylinder (cylinder 2, Fig. 8(b)). which is even more distorted than cylinder 1. The space enclosed by the polypeptide "ribcage" of each cylinder is filled with the aliphatic side chains of alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine (see Table Q), creating

The exclusion of water on forming the hydrophobic cores of these two cylindrical structures must contribute substantially to the initial formation and subsequent stability of the fddea equilibrium form of the enzyme. Despite their distortions and extraneous loops, these cylinders, which lie with their surfaces in contact and their axes approximately perpendicular to one another, therefore form the principal structural elements of the elastase molecule. The surface loops, runs and helices which comprise the rest of the chain lie against their surfaces, so that the complete elastase molecule has a fairly compact globular shape, in which the individual cylinders arc> hard to identify (Fig. 5). All four elastase disulphide bridges are involved in stabilizing the cylinders. Thesth residues are homologous with the four disulphide bridges common to the t'rypsins and the chymotrypsins, have the same handedness as their counterparts in a-chymotrypsin (42 to 58 and 168 to 182 left-handed; 136 to 201 and 191 to 220 right-handed) and show a remarkable similarity in their atomic co-ordinates (r.m.s. deviation between 0, CD and SY atoms of elastase and chymotrypsin is 0.86 A f 0.25 PI), emphasizing their importance in maintaining the structural integrity of the molecule after the zymogen polypeptide chain has folded. The contact regions between cylinders 1 and 2 and between the N-terminal transmolecular strap and the underlying residues are much less hydrophobic in nature than the interiors of each cylinder, involving hydrogen bonds and ion pairs as well as hydrophobic interactions. The contacts which the C-terminal cc-helix makes with the rest of the molecule are entirely hydrophobic in character, with the probable exception of an external salt-bridge between the side chain of ArglO7 (for which no electron density beyond Cd appears in the map) and t'he C-terminal carboxylate group. Details of the amino acids involved in these various contacts are given in Table 9. (iii) Main-chaiu hydrogen bond homologies

Figure 9 is a diagrammatic representation of the complete elastase polypeptide chain which shows all the main-chain hydrogen bonds?. In it the two cylinders have been "opened out" to reveal their topological similarities and to illustrate the p-pleated sheet hydrogen bonding patterns which stabilize their antiparallel chains. This Figure is based on Figure 5 of Shotton & Watson (1970a), although it has been rearranged slightly to clarify the local hydrogen bonding patterns, especially those of the methionine loop and the C-terminal a-helix. As might be expected from the structural similarity between elastase and a-chynlotrypsin, t#hese t'wo enzymes exhibit a striking resemblance in their hydrogen bonding patterns, as is shown in Figure 9.

Frc:. I).-cont. The antiparallel p-sheet cylinder within each half of the elastase molecule has been "opanntl out," by breaks in the chain at residues 84-85 and 161-162 to allow the 3-dimensional structure and bonding patterns to be represented on a plane surface, while preserving as far as possible the contiguity of amino acid residues in the chain. Helical regions and some reverse turns have been drawn straight to simplify the Figure, and their hydrogen bonds are indicated by curved lines. The internal homologous regions of cylinders 1 and 2 lie in the central portions of the 2 halves of the diagram, those residues whose side chains fill the hydrophobic core of each cylinder (see Fig. 8 and Table 9A) being boxed with heavy outlines. The Figure is based on Fig. 6 of Shotton & Watson 1970b). where t,he significance of the topologically similar folding in the 2 halves of the molecule is discussed.

elastase, 110 are also made between corresponding residues in r-cliymotrypsin. Of these, 66 of the 76 /?-sheet or reverse-turn hydrogen bonds, 12 of the 15 hydrogen bonds found in reverse turns elsewhere in the molecule, 19 of the 22 hydrogen bonds which occur in the helical segments, and 13 of the remaining 15 main-chain hydrogen bonds which link sequentially distant parts of the molecule are common to both enzymes. The differences in the main-chain hydrogen bonding networks are analysed in Table 10. Most of these differences occur near "insertions" in the elastase sequrncc~. while the rest are probably attributable to small but real packing differences between the polypeptide chain induced by different side chains, to minor errors in the atomic co-ordinates or to slightly different criteria being employed when deciding in doubtful situations whether or not a hydrogen bond actually exists between two adjacent, groups. (iv) Reverseturns For a sequence of four amino acid residues, Venkatachalam (1968) described three general types of allowed conformation, one helical and two non-helical, in which a hydrogen bond, formed between the carbonyl oxygen of the first residue and the amido group of the fourth, completes a loop of ten atoms. The helical conformation which he called type III, is part of a 3.0,, helix (Bragg ef al., 1950; Donohue, 1953), while conformations I and II involve a reversal in the direction of the polypeptide chain such as is found in antiparallel B-structure. Type 1 turns are possible for any sequence of L-amino acids, except that proline cannot be accommodated in position 3. In type II turns, the middle bond is turned through approximately 180" relative to its orientation in type I, a conformation usually possible only when the third residue is glycine. The type I' and type II' turns are closely related in structure to the type I1 and type I turns, respectively, but both have a further sequence restriction in that glycine residues are usually found in position 2 for type II' turns and in positions 2 and 3 for type I'. The possibility of exceptions to these general rules was discussed b-v Venkatachalam (1968), and such exceptions have been shown to exist in proteins of known tertiary structure by Crawford et al. (1973). The residues which make reverse turns ("hairpin loops" or /3 bends) in the elastase molecule are analysed in Table 11. Those residues which, according to Birktoft & Blow (1972), form a reverse turn in a-chymotrypsin but fail to do so in elastase are also listed. It can be seen that the positions of the majority of the reverse turns in elastase and a-chymotrypsin are identical, the two major causes of differences being elastase insertions at the end of antiparallel loops and slight differences in hydrogen bonding patterns within the C-terminal a-helix. Glycine residues are found in the required positions for the type II and II' turns in elastase, with the exceptions of turns II (131 to 134) and II (145 to 149), where asparagine is found in position 3? and turn II (221A to 224), where arginine occupies the third position. In elastase, residues 125 to 128 form a type II turn, residue 127 being a glycine, whereas in a-chymotrypsin. where this residue is a serine, a type I turn is found. Conversely, residues 23 to 26 in elastase form a type I turn, with asparagine in position 3, while in a-chymotrypsin, where this residue is a glycine, a type II turn is made.

(v) Iielices
As in a-chymotrypsin and trypsin, three regions in elastase show some degree of helical character (see Fig. 9). Residues 55 to 60 form a single turn of irregular 3.0,,

In the methionine loop between residues 164 and 177, the irregular disulphide-bridged helix with mixed 3~0,~ and 3*6,,-type hydrogen bonds found in a-chymotrypsin is further disrupted in elastase by insertions Serl7OA a,nd Serl7OB, altering the hydrogen bonding pattern a little and lessening its helical character (Fig. 9). The most extensive helix present in the molecule is the C-tjerminal x-helix, made by residues 234 t,o 244. These residues form almost three turns of quite regular u-helix. in which all the residues make classical 3*6,,-type hydrogen bonds (Pauling & Corey, 1951). In addition, the two terminal residues Ser244 and Asn245 appear to make poor 3.0,,-type hydrogen bonds to Va1241 and lle242, respectively, as in a-chymotrypsin, thus terminating the helix. As in a-chymotrypsin, the a-helix is preceded by a single turn of 3.0,, helix, whose axis makes an angle of about 40" wit'h t,he cc-helix. This is formed by residues 230 to 234, which make two 3.0,,-type hydrogen

for x1, xz and x3 are shown in Figure 10. During model building a preference was given to staggered conformations for the side chains whenever the electron density was sufficiently diffuse to allow a choice. Subsequent real space and energy refinements have freed the co-ordinates from this strong subjective bias, so that the values presented here correspond as nearly as possible to the observed electron density. Of the 191 recorded x1 values, 174 (91"/") fall within ASO0 of the preferred staggered positions, in reasonable agreement with the results from cc-chymotrypsin (Birktoft & Blow, 1972). (b) Atomic co-ordinate

comparisonswith u-chymotrypsin

An analysis of the conformational similarity between elastase and u-chymotrypsin has been made using the procedure outlined in section 7(b), above. The differences observed between homologous side chains are greater than for the equivalent mainchain groups but the overall similarity between the two structures is striking. The r.m.s. difference between all equivalent atoms of 1.92 A falls to 1.80 A for the mainchain atoms alone. Huber et al. (1974) have also compared bovine trypsin from the

ATOMIC

STRUCTURE

OF

ELARTARE

trypsin-trypsin inhibitor complex with u-chymotrypsin. In order to facilitate the comparison between the three structures, we have also compared the positions of the atoms in segments 16 to 33,39 to 58,69 to 71,79 to 94, 102 to 124, 133 to 142, 152 to 168, 173 to 183, 191 to 201, 211 to 216 and 225 to 245 (see Huber et al., 1974) of a-ch;ymotrypsin with elastase. The r.m.s. difference for all atoms was 1.15 A (0.93 A for main-chain atoms only) compared with the equivalent value for trypsin of 0.75 8. Of the major structural differences reported by Huber et al. (1974) for trypsin (> 1.5 A), only those of residues 116, 161 and the carboxy-terminus appear as major differences in the comparison of elastase with a-chymotrypsin. (c) Side chain hydrogen bond homologies

All the internal polar side-chains of elastase, as well as several surface and external side-chains, make hydrogen bonds to main-chain atoms, internal water molecules or other side chains (see Table 7). These bonds leave no internal side-chain potential hydrogen bond donor or acceptor unsatisfied. Because of the sequence differences between elastase and u-chymotrypsin, there is naturally a considerable difference in the hydrogen bonding patterns made by their amino acid side-chains. What is remarkable is the degree of similarity which exists despite these sequence differences. Of the 60 elastase side-chain hydrogen bonds, 26 are also found to be present in a-chymotrypsin, all but three being made by homologous side-chains (see Fig. 11). Eight of the 26 similar, and only three of the 34 dissimilar side-chain hydrogen bonds link the two halves of the elastase molecule. The differences in the hydrogen bonding pattern of the homologous residues, and also t'he four structurally similar hydrogen bonds formed by non-homologous side-chains. are listed in Table 12. (d) Di&bution of side chains

The low degree of sequence homology between amino acid residues which make up the molecular surfaces of elastase and u-chymotrypsin renders them quite dissimilar in t,erms of specific groupings of amino acid side-chains, thus giving them little if any antigenic cross-reactivity. The general distribution pattern for the side chains of these enzymes resembles that observed in other proteins. The environment in which the different side chains and functional groups are located within the native elastasc molecule are analysed in Table 13. (i) Charged residues

With three important exceptions, discussed below, all the charged residues of elastase lie in solvatable positions on or protruding from the molecular surface. The charges are fairly evenly distributed, and the enzyme carries a net positive charge in the physiological pH range of between 5+ and 11+, depending on the ionization states of the six histidine residues. Gertler (1971) has shown that maleylation of the three lysine residues in elastase abolishes its ability to bind to and digest elastin. Kagan et al. (1972) and Kagan & Jordan (personal communication) have extended these observations by showing that preincubation of elastin with low concentrations of anionic detergents stimulates elastolysis, while cationic detergents have the reverse effect. This is probably due to alteration of the surface charge of the substrate. because maleylation of the lysine residues of elastase is found to restore partially the abilny of the enzyme to attack the positively charged elastin-cationic detergent

complex. Thus it would appear that non-specific enzyme-substrate charge attraction is an important initial step in the productive binding of elastase to large insoluble substrates such as elastin. despite the fact that there are no lysine residues and feupositive charges in the immediate vicinity of the catalytic site of the enzyme, and that no basic residues seem to be involved in binding tetrapeptide substrates (Shotton et aE., 1971 ; Atlas, 1975). Several of the charged surface residues make stabilizing intermolecular salt bridges and hydrogen bonds to neighbouring molecules in the elastase crystal (see Table 7). The only possible int,ramolecular surface salt bridge is that between the N@ atom of Argl70 (for which no clear density appears in the map beyond Cd) and the carboxyl group of the C-terminal residue, Asn245. Like the equivalent salt bridge made by LyslO7 in a-chymotrypsin, this would play a significant role in holding the C-terminal helix in place, stabilizing the enzyme and protecting it from digestion by carboxypeptidase-A, in the presence of which elastase has to function in vivo. (ii) Uncharged polar side-chains mostly between groups on the positions where edge of a tryptothe rest of the

A few uncharged polar side-chains are found in internal positions, the two cylinders, making good hydrogen bonds with other internal prctein or with water molecules. The rest lie in surface or external they can be solvated, often only the t.ip of the side chain or the Ncl phan ring emerging from the hydrophobic environment in which residue lies. (iii) Non-polar side chains

The molecular interior of elastase is generally hydrophobic and shows a high degree of sequence homology, especially within the centres of the two cylinders discussed in section 7, above. While many aliphatic side-chains are involved in forming these two hydrophobic oil drop regions (see Table 9), approximately half of the hydrophobic residues in elastase, as in a-chymotrypsin and most other proteins, are located in dispersed surface or external positions of low sequence homology (Shotton & Hartley, 1970; see Table 13). Other regions in elastase rich in non-polar side-chains include the N-terminal region and the inner face of the C-terminal a-helix, together with those residues which make up their van der Waals' contact surfaces in the body of the molecule (see Table 9). (iv) Aromatic residues

The aromatic residues tend neither to occupy the hydrophobic cores of the cylinders nor to project far into the solvent, but rather to lie within the surface layer of the enzyme between the water-protein interface and the polypeptide rib cage of the two cylinders. Here, in contrast to the aliphatic and polar side-chains, they are often found in clusters. For example, the rings of Trp27, Tyr137, Tyr159, His200 and T.yr207 form a very prominent cluster of stacked aromatic rings whose hydrophobic interactions help to hold the base of the N-terminal transmolecular strap to the other ha,lf of the molecule, and those of His91, Tyr93, TyrlOl, Tyr234 and Trp237 serve the same stabilizing function at the base of the C-terminal a-helix. A study of the accessibility of the 11 tyrosines in elastase (Gorbunoff t Timasheff, 1972) shows that eight tyrosine hydroxyl groups are freely accessible, two are partially so, and one

Here side-chain differences of a compensatory nature are observed, one enzyme having a small residue and an adjacent large one in place of the large side chain and neighbouring small one found at the corresponding points in the other enzyme, thereby preserving the conformational identity and common hydrogen-bonding patterns of the main chains without creating intermolecular cavities or overcrowding, Examples of such side-chain differences are Ser29 and His200 in elastase in place of Trp29 and Va1200 in a-chymotrypsin (Fig. 12 (a) and (b) and the cluster of side chains made by Leu130, Ala208 and His210 in elastase and by Phel30, Thr208 and Va1210 in a-chymotrypsin (Fig. 12 (c) and (d)). Hartley (1966,1970,1974) has pointed out tha.t the occurrence of such compensatory changes cannot be accounted for by random single-base point mutations from a common ancestor, unless gene duplication occurs to relieve the selection pressure for full catalytic competence from the evolving enzyme. (However, the entrapment, of a water molecule could compensate for the loss of a bulky side chain if the resulting cavity were lined with hydrophilic groups. In section 9(b), below we discuss a situation in elastase in which we observe such a substitution of a bulky side-chain by a water molecule.

About 90 of the many external water molecules visible in the map form single hydrogen bonds with surface polar groups on the elastase molecule (see Table 7). A further 21 water molecules, arbitrarily numbered EW-1 to EW-21, lie close to the enzyme surface and bind to at least two groups on the enzyme, as shown in Table 14A. Of these only EW-2, EW-8 and EW-15 occupy positions similar to those occupied by bound water molecules (W-39, W-38 and W-l, respectively) in a-chymotrypsin

We observed 25 water peaks within the folds of the elastase polypeptide chain, where they make good hydrogen bonds with neighbouring protein groups. These internal water molecules have been arbitrarily numbered IW-1 to IW-25, as listed in Table 14B. A total of 14 internal water molecules have been reported for cc-chymotrypsin (Birktoft & Blow, 1972), but in other enzyme families the occurrence of such buried water molecules seems much more unusual. In elastase there is a noticeable tendency for these water molecules to occur in clusters, forming hydrogen bonds to one another as well as bo the enzyme. The locations and bonding patterns of three of the four clusters (see Fig. 11) are very similar to those observed in u-chymotrypsin. The first cluster (IW-9, IW-10, IW-11, IW-12, IW-22, IW-23 and IW-24 in elastase; W-15, W-16, W-17 and W-18inc+chymotrypsin), shown in Figure 13, lies near the end of cylinder 1 and serves to stabilize both the uranyl loop (residues 66 to 83 ; Shotton & Watson, 1970b) and the turn which the N-terminal stretch of chain makes at this point. Another group (IW-13, IW-14 and IW-15 in elastase; W-6, W-7, W-9 and W-14 in u-chymotrypsin) is shown in Figure 14. It lies between cylinders 1 and 2, linking them together and at the same time stabilizing the active centre serine region. The third homologous cluster (IW-19, IW-20 and IW-21 in elastase; W-10 and W-11 in cr-chymotrypsin), illustrated in Figure 15, is also located between cylinders 1 and 2, apparently helping to hold the tip of the aspartate loop (residues 85 to 110) against the C-terminal half of the molecule in the active centre region. By increasing the dielectric constant in that region, these water molecules probably help to stabilize the enzyme by delocalizing the negative charge of the

nearby buried carboxylate group of Aspl02, the active centre aspartic acid residue. In elastase, where residue 100 is a glycine, we find an extra water molecule, IW-21, occupying the space filled in chymotrypsin by the side-chain of AsnlOO (cf. Fig. 17 of Birktoft & Blow, 1972). Figure 16 shows the fourth cluster (IW-5, IW-6, IW-7, IW-8, IW-17 and IW-lS), of which only IW-18 has a direct counterpart (W-50) in x-chymotrypsin. This group lies at one end of cylinder 2 and links the bases of the methionine loop (residues 161 to 185) and the C-terminal helix together with that stretch of the polypeptide chain around residue 130 which joins N and C-terminal halves of the molecule. Of the remaining internal water molecules in elastase, IW-1. IW-2, IW-3 and IW-4 are all located fairly close to one another, between the loops made by excursions of the polypeptide chain from the surface of cylinder 2. Of these, only IW-1 has a homologue (W-5) in cr-chymotrypsin. In u-chymotrypsin several water molecules are thought to help stabilize the charged N and C-terminal residues by charge delocalization (Birktoft & Blow, 1972). These water molecules (W-13. W-27 and W-28) have no counterparts in the elastase structure. The other two internal waters, IW-16 and IW-25, occupy positions near other loops in the polypeptide chain. The ligands which bind IW-25 (Table 14B) are identical to those found by Bode & Schwager (1975a,b) to bind a calcium ion in bovine fi-trypsin. In the tosyl-elastase electron density map, the IW-25 peak is well-defined but not significantly denser than other internal water molecules. The size of this peak may have been influenced by the proximity of the uranyl site used in phasing, and therefore we are unable to decide whether or not IW-25 is a bound

In a previous study (Shotton et al., 1971) it was demonstrated that crystalline elastase at pH 8-O shows a high degree of catalytic competence against the small, easily diffusible ester substrate N-benzoyl-L-alanine methyl ester (Kaplan & Dugas, 1969), and that at 3.5 A resolution the structures of the native enzyme at pH 5.0 and pH 8.5 are indistinguishable from one another, differing from the structure of tosylelastase only in the immediate vicinity of the active centre. The pH 5.0 structure determination has now been extended to 2.5 A resolution to facilitate comparison with the high-resolution structure of tosyl elastase. A complete set of three-dimensional 2.5 A resolution diffraction data was collected from a crystal of native elastase in equilibrium with 1.2 M-sodium sulphate, 0.05 M-sodium acetate (pH 50), and then scaled to the tosyl-elastase parent data set using the procedures described in Methods.

sections were plotted on Perspex sheets and viewed in the optical comparator t,ogether with the skeletal model of tosyl-elastase, which was then modified as shown in Figure 17 to represent the native structure. The native elastase active site coordinates were recorded and checked using the computer model-building procedure described in section 5 and are presented in Table 15. (b) The native conformdon The results of this comparison confirm the conclusions made from previous studies that the conformational differences between tosyl-elastase and native elastase are restricted to the immediate vicinity of the catalytic site. At pH 5-O the covalent attachment of the tosyl group to the 0~ at,om of the active centre serine residue Ser195 to form tosyl-elastase causes a small conformational change in that residue. The tosyl group itself is unable to bind in the S, subsite (nomenclature of Schechter & Berger, 1967) as it does in a-chymotrypsin (Steitz et al., 1969), because of the reduced size of this binding pocket in elastase (Shotton & Watson, 1970b; Shotton et al., 1971). Instead, it projects from the molecular surface, displacing a sulphate ion, SU-2, which in the native enzyme at pH 5.0 is bound about 3.4 A and 4-O A from the side-chain atoms 0~ and Nc2 of the active centre residues Ser195 and His57, respectively. Tulinsky & Wright (1973) have reported a sulphate ion strongly bound in a similar position at the active site of native u-chymotrypsin and Bode & Schwager (19756) have found a similar high density peak at the active site of benzamidine-inhibited trypsin . The presence of the bulky tosyl group also displaces the imidazole side-chain of His57 from its native position in which the Ndl atom forms a hydrogen bond with the C)dl atom of Aspl02, to an exposed surface position in which this interaction is impossible. This involves rotations of the His57 side-chain about its Ca-Co and CY--Cy bonds: x1 and x2 changing from 95" and -118" in native elastase to - 160" and -5" in tosyl-elastase, respectively (see Tables 8 a,nd 15). This further results in the displacement of two external water molecules, EW-22 and EW-23, which in native elasta,se appear to form a hydrogen-bonding bridge between the carboxyl group of Asp60 and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Thr96.

similady

It was clear from previous work (Shotton et al., 1971) that the catalytic sites of native elastasr and u-chymotrypsin were closely similar. The elastase high-resolution structure study and subsequent refinement of both these enzymes now allow us to quantify and qualify the similarity. The r.m.s. difference between main-chain and side-chain atoms of seven of the residues (16, 57> 102, 193, 194, 195 and 214) which are essential for catalysis, substrate binding or maintenance of the active conformat'ion is 0.72 d. The degree of similarity can be clearly seen in Figure 18, which shows the active site conformation of elastase and the atomic difference vectors between it and that of a-chymotrypsin. The most striking difference between the two active sites involves the orientation of 0~ of Ser195, the active site serine residue. In achymotrypsin, x1 is +93", while in native elastase (pH 5.0) x1 is -84" (Table 15) and resembles closely the orientation found in the other serine proteinases. The implications of this for substrate binding have been fully discussed by Bode et al. (1976).

(b) The charge relay system The three buried charged residues in elastase, AsplOB, Asp194 and the E-terminal residue Va116, are, as in a-chymotrypsin, all essentially involved in catalysis. RIO\\ et al, (1969) proposed a charge relay system to account for the catalytic activities of the serine proteinases. Sn this the 0 d1 atom of the buried carboxyl group of Asp102 forms a hydrogen bond with the Ndl atom of the active centrc histidine residue His57, while the NE' atom of the histidine hydrogen bonds with the 0~ atom of Ser195. This binding arrangement would allow the unfavourable free energy contribution of the negatively charged carboxylate group, buried in a hydrophobic environment, to be reduced by charge delocalization, leading to an increase in t)he nuclrophilicity of the active centre serine residue Ser195. It is clear from the pH 5.0 native elastase electron density difference map that the histidine No1 atom points directly towards the protonated Odl oxygen of the Asp102 carboxyl group, as for the other serine protinases. In their initial work on DIPtrypsin at pH 7.5, Krieger et al. (1974) suggested that the histidine No1 atom made a symmetrical interaction with AsplO2, pointing between O*i and 062 and making a bifurcated hydrogen bond with both oxygens. Further refinement of the DIP-trypsin as shown that this is not the case, but rather structure (Chambers & Stroud, 1977) h that the N*l nitrogen atom makes a direct hydrogen bond with only one of the oxygen as in the other enzymes. (062 in their nomenclature), Fersht $ Sperling (1973) have interpreted their t'itration studies as showing that' both in chymotrypsin and in chymotrypsinogen the carboxyl group of Asp102 i* deprotonated and charged above pH 4.3. The more specific nuclear magnetic resonance studies reported by Hunkapiller et al. (1973) have shown that, in a-lytic proteasc (a homologous bacterial serine proteinase) the pK, value of the equivalent aspartic acid residue is 6.7, while that of the single histidine equivalent to His57 is below 4.0. If this is also true for elastase, then the pK, value of about 6.7 observed for elastasc activity corresponds to the deprotonation of AsplOB, leaving these residues at the pH optimum for catalysis of about pH 85 bearing one net negative charge, formall? located on the carboxylate group of AsplO2. OY of Ser195 in native elastase is 3.4 A from Nc2 of His57. It lies close to the plane defined by the imidazole ring, but the angle it makes with the Xc2 atom is highl) unsuitable for the formation of a strong hydrogen bond (Fig. 18). Krant and his colleagues have discovered that other serine proteinases share this "unsuitable" conformational alignment of 0~ and NE~ atoms, and have discussed the implications of these findings for the charge relay system theory and for the catalytic mechanism of the serine proteinases (Mathews et al., unpublished work). (c) The ValltSL4sp194 ion pair

Upon activation of the zymogen proelastase by proteolytic removal of a small peptide N-terminal to residue Vall6 (Gertler & Birk, 1970), the enzyme undergoes a conformational change leading to the formation of an internal ion pair between the newly created amino group of Vall6 and the carboxylate group of Asp194. Together with the carboxylate group of AsplO2, these two charged groups are the only ones which occupy buried internal positions in t,he elastase molecule. There has been considerable confusion about the role of this buried ion pair in stabilizing the active conformation of elastase since the report of Kaplan & Dugas

(1969), in which they claimed that the amino group of Va116 could be fully acetylated without loss of esterase activity. This seemed to be in contradiction to a growing body of evidence on elastase (Gertler 6 Hofmann, 1970), trypsin (Scrimger & Hofmann. 1967 ; Robinson el: al., 1973) and chymotrypsin (Oppenheimer et al., 1966: Ghelis et al.. 1970; Garel $ Labouesse, 1970; Hess, 1971) which pointed to the essential role of t'he N-terminal amino group in stabilizing the active conformation of these enzymes. In particular, the careful studies of Fersht t Requena (1971) and Fersht (1972) revealed that for a-chymotrypsin this ion pair contributes a stabilization energy of 12.2 kJ mol-l to the active conformation, there being a delicately balanced equilibrium between the active conformation in which NH,f (Ile16) is internal and involved in forming this ion pair, and an inactive conformation in which it is exposed and readily accesssible to reagents. Karibian et al. (1974) have now shown that the NH: (Va116) of elastase is essential for activity. This residue shows a low reactivity to reagents (Kaplan et al., 1971: Kurosky t Hofmann, 1972), indicating that for most of the time it is buried in thr molecular interior. For example, it is possible to acetylate or maleylate the amino groups of the three surface lysine residues of elastase while leaving the N-terminal amino group unmodified. In this modified form the enzyme retains full activity against small synthetic substrates, although its ability to bind to and hydrolyse elastin is decreased (Gertler & Birk, 1970; Gertler, 1971; Karibian et al., 1974). However. Karibian et al. (1974) have shown that if severe conditions are used, the N-terminal amino group can also be acylated to some extent, enzymic activity being lost in proportion to the fraction of molecules in which the N-terminal group is modified. Furthermore, if the inactive and the active elastase molecules from a partially inhibited preparation are separated, they found that the inactive elastase possesses no detectable free amino group, while the N-terminal amino group of the active enzyme is completely unmodified. Under no conditions was it possible to obtain modification of the amino group of Vall6 of elastase without loss of enzymic activity. Thus it would seem that the situation in elastase is essentially the same as that in the other pancreatic serine proteinases, and that the increase in catalytic efficiency upon activation of the zymogens of these enzymes can be explained by a unified theory. Upon proteolytic cleavage of the 15-16 peptide bond, a conformational rearrangement occurs in which the 16-194 ion pair, the S, substrate binding site and the "oxyanion hole" (see below) are formed (Wright, 1973a,b; Robertus et al., 1972). This active conformation of the native enzyme exists in equilibrium with a more zymogen-like inactive conformation, the balance of the equilibrium in favour of the catalytically active conformation being dependent, on the stabilization energy provided by the buried ion pair. Thus the integrity of this ion pair, which depends on both the carboxylate group of Asp194 and the N-terminal amino group of residue 16 being unmodified and ionized, is of great importance for the catalytic activitv of all members of this enzyme family. (d) Extended substrate binding site

The differing substrate specificities of trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase, which hydrolyse peptide bonds on the carboxyl-terminal side of basic, aromatic and small aliphatic amino acid residues, respectively, seemed initially to be explainable on the basis of a few simple amino acid substitutions in the substrate binding pockets of these enzymes (Steitz et al., 1969; Shotton t Watson, 1970a,b; Shotton, 1971;

Thompson t Blout (1970. 1973a,b,c,d) and Powers BE Tuhy (1972,1973) has shown that for elantase the situation is more complex. Both chymotrypsin and trypsin possess a deep substrate binding pocket adjacent to the catalytic site (Steitz et al., 1969; Stroud et al., 1971) into which fits the side chain of the substrate specificity residue P, (nomenclature of Schechter & Berger. 1967). The binding energy derived from the very favourable interaction between the correct P, amino acid side-chain and this binding pocket (subsite S,) is sufficient to render the binding energy contributions of the other substmbe residues at other subsites relatively insignificant in determining the overall substrate specificity and strength of binding. By contrast', the S, binding pocket in elastase is occluded by t,hr occurrence of two bulky amino acid side-chains, those of Va1216 and Thr226 (Shot,ton & Watson, 19706) in place of the two glycine residues found in these positions in trypsin and chymotrypsin. Consequently, only relatively small aliphatic side-chains bind at subsite S,. To compensate for the relat'ively weak substrat!r binding intclractions possible at this occluded S, substrate binding sit,e. c>lastasc possesses au extended substrate binding site which has now been shown to involve eight. subsites (Atlas, 1975), each of which contributes significantly t,o the total binding energy. giving very efficient binding for natural peptide substrates. The 3.5 A resolution studies of the binding of free di-, tri- and tctrapeptide substmte analogues to the active site of native elastase at a variety of pH values (Shot'ton et ab.. 1971) lead to the surprising indication that the orientation and binding interactions of substrate residues on the amino terminal side of residue P, were quite different from those observed in pancreatic chymotrypsin and trypsin. In complexes of covalently linked chloromethyl ketone peptides to y-chymotrypsin (Segal et al., 1971), of free peptides to cr-chymotrypsin (Steitz rt ul.. 1969) and of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor to a-chymotrypsin (Blow et al.. 1972) and trypsin (Riihlmann et al., 1973), the substrate residues P,, P, and P, in each case are thought to form a short stretch of antiparallel ,&structure wiOh residues 214, 215 and 216. In elastase this appears not to happen. Instead, those residues of the peptide substrate analogue which are N-terminal to P, bind in almost the opposite orientation. in t'hc vicinity of the main-chain atoms of Thr41 and Gln192. While the difference electron density maps obtained from the 3.5 A resolution measurements are not sufficient'ly detailed to permit the assignment of hydrogen bonds and Do reveal the intricacies of the hydrophobic contacts between the substrate and the enzyme. they do show with great clarity (see Figs 5, 6 and 7 of Shotton et al.. 1971) the general position of binding of these peptides in the groove between the two halves of the elastase molecule. This alternat#ive substrate binding mode is supported by the results which have been obtained from solution studies designed to explore the nature of the different subsitcs in the extended binding site (Atlas, 1975, and references therein). Perhaps this difference in the mode of substrate attachment is essential if elastase is to express its specificity for cleavage next to small aliphatic amino acid residues, in the absence of the tight binding of a large P, side-chain at subsite S1.

of the amido nitrogens of Gly193 and Ser195 in forming stabilizing hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate peptide bond undergoing hydrolysis (see also Henderson, 1970; Henderson et al., 1971). Robertus et al. (1972) have shown that the functional equivalents of these two amido groups in subtilisin, namely NH(Ser221) and Nd2(Asn155), are equally important in stabilizing its substrate. They have emphasized, however, that in subtilisin these stabilizing hydrogen bonds can only be formed after the carbonyl carbon of the susceptible peptide bond has been distorted from the planar conformation of the Michaelis complex to a tetrahedral intermediate, by the nucleophilic attack of the 0~ atom of the active centre serine residue Ser221. In that situation, a closer contact between the enzyme and substrate becomes possible and the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate, which now carries a formal negative charge, moves into a position termed the oxyanion hole where it can now be stabilized by the formation of these two hydrogen bonds to NH(Ser221) and Nd2(Asn155). This extra stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate over the Michaelis complex lowers the free energy of activation for the rate-limiting transition state and promotes substrate hydrolysis. By analogy, Robertus et al. (1972) suggest that a similar situation exist,s in the pancreatic serine proteinases, and that the various schemes put forward for catalysis in a-chymotrypsin (Henderson, 1970; Robillard et al., 1972; Wright, 19736). in which the hydrogen bonds from the amido groups of Gly193 and Ser195 to the substrate carbonyl oxygen are made prior to distortion of the carbonyl carbon at)om to the tetrahedral intermediate, are in need of revision. In native elastase the amido groups of Gly193 and SerlO5 are situated so as to form an oxyanion hole for the carbonyl oxygen of an incoming substrate, as in a-chymotrypsin, although the 3.5 A substrate binding studies (Shotton et al., 1971) are not sufficient to determine whether such hydrogen bonds are formed in the Michaelis complex or only in the tetrahedral intermediate. More recent high-resolution studies of the binding of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor to bovine trypsin (Bode et al., 1976) have clearly shown that, upon binding, the carboxyl carbon of the substrate's susceptible peptide bond forms strong hydrogen bonds with the amido groups of Gly193 and Ser195 and in doing so is severely distorted towards the tetrahedral conformation. facilitating the subsequent nucleophilic attack of the active centre serine oxygen.
