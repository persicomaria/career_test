ABSTRACT Methylation of the exocyclic amino group of guanine is a relatively common modification in rRNA and tRNA. Single methylation (N2-methylguanosine, m2G) is the second most frequently encountered nucleoside analog in Escherichia coli rRNAs. The most prominent case of dual methylation (N2,N2-dimethylguanosine, m22G) is found in the majority of eukaryotic tRNAs at base pair m22G26:A44. The latter modification eliminates the ability of the N2 function to donate in hydrogen bonds ` and alters its pairing behavior, notably vis-a-vis C. Perhaps a less obvious consequence of the N2,N2-dimethyl modification is its role in controlling the pairing modes between G and A. We have determined the crystal structure of a 13-mer RNA duplex with central tandem m22G:A pairs. In the structure both pairs adopt an imino-hydrogen bonded, pseudo-Watson­Crick conformation. Thus, the sheared conformation frequently seen in tandem G:A pairs is avoided due to a potential steric clash between an N2-methyl group and the major groove edge of A. Additionally, for a series of G:A containing self-complementary RNAs we investigated how methylation affects competitive hairpin versus duplex formation based on UV melting profile analysis.

INTRODUCTION Post-translational modifications of rRNA, mRNA, tRNA, and snRNA are ubiquitous and concern both the sugar and nucleobase moieties (Grosjean and Benne 1998; Rozenski et al. 1999). Methylation of bases and the ribose 29-hydroxyl group are particularly common, but the functional purpose of modifications has remained mysterious in many cases. The rRNAs in Escherichia coli contain five m2G, three m5C, and four 29-O-methylated residues among the 24 methylated nucleotides (Møller Andersen and Douthwaite 2006). Crystal structures of the E. coli ribosome (Schuwirth et al. 2005) allow detailed insights into the individual environment of the five m2G residues and site-specific RNA methyltransferases involved, and the potential functions of

m2G residues in rRNAs have recently been reviewed (Sergiev et al. 2007). The m2G residues map to three clusters of modified nucleotides in the decoding and peptidyltransferase centers and the subunit interface. It is hypothesized that methylation either serves the formation of a hydrophobic contact with protein or RNA or a structural purpose such as the prevention of base triples involving the minor groove (Lesnyak et al. 2007; Sergiev et al. 2007). The m22G nucleotide is found in the bend between the dihydro-uridine stem and the anticodon stem in the vast majority of eukaryotic tRNAs (Edqvist et al. 1992; Grosjean and Benne 1998). At that location, m22G26 is paired with A44 and flanked by C27:G43 on one side and the m2G10-C25-G45 triple on the other. Both G10:C25 and the adjacent C11:G24 pair serve as identity elements for the dimethylating enzyme targeting G26. It has been pointed out that the presence of m22G in cytosolic tRNAs most likely prevents them from folding into atypical structures adopted by mitochondrial tRNAs (mtRNAs) that do not feature the six canonical base pairs in the anticodon stem (Steinberg and Cedergren 1995). This interpretation is supported by the fact that bacterial tRNAs are unable to adopt such alternative folds, thus precluding the need for 2125

On the other hand, it is noteworthy elucidate their base pairing and stacking interactions at the that base methylation affects the equilibrium of the duplexatomic level. In solution, methylation can affect hairpin/ hairpin conversion with RNA oligonucleotides (Micura duplex equilibria of self-complementary sequences. Howet al. 2001). The effects of base methylation on the ever, it is not yet well understood whether this effect is a duplex-hairpin conversion were systematically investigated consequence of methylation itself (leading to increased with the self-complementary sequence r(CGCGAAUUCG hydrophobicity, and consequently, altered hydration) or CGA), which forms a stable Watson Crick base-paired rather the result of a change in the base-pairing mode duplex under a variety of buffer conditions.

Conversely, the duplex structure is retained and even stabilized by replacement of a central nucleotide with m2G or N4methylcytidine (m4C). By comparison, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) represented a borderline case. Although generally a duplex-preserving modification, the data indicated that m6A in strand position 5 and at low-strand concentrations is able to bring about duplex-to-hairpin conversion. The role of base methylation on the conformation of the ribosomal helix-45 sequence motif (small subunit), r(GACCm2GGm62Am62AGGUC), was ¨ also assessed (Hobartner et al. 2002).

profile analyses for self-complementary oligoribonucleotide sequences with G:A mismatch pairs and the corresponding methylated counterparts. Although melting profiles deliver a qualitative rather than a quantitative picture, they nevertheless serve as a useful framework for the main focus of the present work, the crystal structure of a 13-mer RNA with ° central m22G:A pairs that was determined at 1.8 A resolution. This structure allows detailed insights into the geometry of the m22G:A pair and its hydration relative to the native imino-type G:A pair, as well as the differences due to stacking compared with duplexes containing tandem G:A pairs of the sheared type (SantaLucia and Turner 1993; Heus et al. 1997; Jang et al. 2004). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Influence of the m1G and m22G modifications paired with A on the thermal stability of RNA and the duplex-hairpin equilibrium We initiated our investigation by selecting three selfcomplementary oligoribonucleotide sequences to assess how methylated guanosine residues opposite A (underlined below) affect RNA stability and secondary structure. These are the 11-mer 59-GACGGACGUCU (11GA), the 12-mer 59-CGCGAAUUAGCG (12GA), and the 13-mer 59GGACGGACGUCCU (13GA) (Fig. 1). All three sequences can, in principle, adopt hairpin and duplex secondary structures (Fig. 2). Both 11GA and 13GA feature 39terminal dangling Us and central tandem G:A pairs (duplex) or unpaired G and A within the loop (hairpin). In contrast, 12GA forms a blunt-end duplex or hairpin and single G:A pairs are separated by four central A:U pairs (duplex), or G:A forms the loop-closing base pair stacked onto the stem of the alternative hairpin structure. The corresponding methylated oligonucleotides are referred to as 11m22GA, 12m1GA, 12m22GA, 13m1GA, and 13m22GA (Fig. 1). In both the 11-mer and 13-mer RNAs, the sequence of the central tetramer is 59-GGAC, and thus, G and A can be expected to pair via imino-hydrogen bonding in the duplex form. Tandem G:A pairs were generally found to exhibit this pairing type when the first G:A was preceded by G (as in 59-GCGGACGC) or in cases where the positions of tandem G:A pairs were switched (as in 59GGCAGGCC) (Wu and Turner 1996). Conversely, tandem G:A pairs in RNAs containing, for example, the tetramers 59-CGAG (SantaLucia and Turner 1993; Jang et al. 2004) or 59-UGAA (Heus et al. 1997), displayed the sheared conformation (Fig. 1; Table 1). In the case of the 12GA duplex, the two isolated G:A mismatches adopted the iminohydrogen bonded conformation as established by X-ray crystallography (Leonard et al. 1994; Li et al. 2007). We carried out concentration-dependent UV-melting experiments with a total of 10 self-complementary RNAs (12GA, 13GA, 12m1GA, 13m1GA, 12m22GA, 13m22GA,

11GA, 11m22GA, 8GA, and 8m1GA) to obtain a qualitative picture of the influence of G/A base-pair methylation on RNA secondary structure and stability (Fig. 2; Supplemental Fig. S1 [derivative profiles]). All RNAs were measured in a concentration range between z1 and z100 mM. Concentration dependence of Tm values versus concentration independence of Tm values was used as a primary criterion to distinguish between duplex and hairpin formation. In addition, hyperchromicity and the shape of the melting profiles provided further hints as to the (co)existence of hairpin and duplex secondary structures in solution. We are aware that for the quantification of hairpin/duplex ratios, other methods such as gel-shift assays under native conditions (Bernacchi et al. 2005, 2007; Ennifar et al. 2007; Sun et al. 2007) or NMR spectroscopy are required (Micura et al. 2001). Here, the set of RNAs was exclusively investigated by UV absorbance/temperature profiles. Nevertheless, this study provides a useful qualitative picture of how the sequence context in which the GA mismatch is embedded impacts secondary structure and stability of the respective RNAs. For example, 12GA shows a melting transition at 57.4°C that hardly changes with concentration (Fig. 2A, left). This behavior clearly refers to a hairpin transition in solution and is in accordance with the relatively small change in hyperchromicity of about 11%, due to melting of the small number of base pairs in the hairpin stem. At increasing RNA concentrations, a second transition appears for 12GA at around 15°C, indicating competing duplex formation. At first sight, the melting of the duplex appears low when compared with other GA mismatch containing duplexes (Morse and Draper 1995). However, the Watson­Crick paired regions in the 12GA duplex consist of two terminal CGC/GCG tracks and one central AAUU/UUAA track, separated by the G:A mismatches. These Watson­Crick paired duplex regions are at the nucleation limit (three to four nucleotides) (Saenger 1984). Moreover, the bimolecular species is a blunt-end duplex with two terminal G:C pairs, prone to base-pair fraying. This feature, together with a central track that consists of ``weak'' A:U pairs, may constitute the major reason for the low melting of the duplex form of 12GA. When G is replaced by m1G, the melting transition for 12m1GA is observed at 61°C (increase of 3.5°C compared with 12GA) and remains concentration independent (Fig. 2B, left). Also, the hyperchromicity is comparable to nonmodified 12GA (z11%), thus supporting hairpin formation. For higher concentrations (>40 mM) a second transition emerges around 10°C, pointing to duplex formation. Likewise, replacement of G by m22G (12m22GA) yields a melting behavior comparable to nonmodified 12GA: The N2 doubly methylated guanine increases hairpin stability by the same amount as m1G does (Fig. 2C, left).

high concentrations allow a rough estimation, suggesting a destabilization of the duplex by methylation. The 13GA RNA shows a melting behavior that--at first sight--implies a hairpin structure due to concentration independence of the melting process (Fig. 2A, right). A more detailed analysis of the profiles at different concentrations suggests that dominant hairpin formation is encountered only at low concentrations according to the small hyperchromicity of z18% (2 mM) compared with z28% at the highest concentration measured (85 mM). Moreover, deviation from an ideal sigmoid shape of the profile at 5-mM concentration indicates competition with an alternative structure. The slight ``step'' around 50°C moves to higher temperatures with increasing RNA concentration and suggests duplex formation with a Tm value in the same range as the hairpin's Tm. This interpretation makes sense when compared with the melting behavior of the corresponding methylated counterparts 13m1GA (Fig. 2B, right) and 13m22GA (Fig. 2C, right). For these modified RNAs, the concentration-dependent, ``low hyperchromicity'' transition is observed at lower temperatures. Thereby, it is significantly separated from the concentrationindependent, ``high hyperchromicity'' transition, allowing more accurate determination of Tm values for the two melting transitions. To summarize, the thermal hairpin stability of 13GA remains rather unaffected by m1G replacement (13m1GA) and is slightly destabilized (1°C) by m22G replacement (13m22GA). Concerning duplex stabilities within this series, the melting profile analysis suggests significant destabilization, which is more pronounced for replacement of G by m22G than for replacement by m1G. The 13GA sequence differs from 11GA by formation of an additional G:C base pair at the termini of the duplex or respective hairpin. The effects of the shortening are dramatic in that the melting profiles for 11GA show nearly ideal sigmoid shapes together with a clear concentration dependence

of the Tm values, characteristic for duplex formation (Fig. 2D, left). Also, the hyperchromicity of about 30% is consistent with the higher number of base pairs that are broken (upon melting of the duplex) and is significantly larger compared with the 18% hyperchromicity observed for the hairpin-forming 13GA RNA (at low concentration) (Fig. 2A, right). Interestingly, replacement of G by m22G in 11GA results in an ambivalent melting behavior (reminiscent of that triggered by N6 methylation of adenosine-5 in rCGCGAAUUCGCGA; Micura et al. 2001). At low RNA concentrations, high Tm values are observed with small hyperchromicity. By increasing the concentration of the RNA, Tm values first decrease and then increase again. Such a behavior is characteristic for a mixture of hairpin and duplex structures with duplex Tm values slightly lower than the respective hairpin's Tm values (Micura et al. 2001). In addition to the series of 11GA, 12GA, 13GA, and the corresponding methylated counterparts, we investigated a short eight-nucleotide, tandem GA sequence motif where hairpin formation is significantly less likely compared with duplex formation because of a very short (and therefore less stable) stem region in the hairpin alternative. Indeed, both 8GA and 8m1GA show nearly ideal sigmoid melting profiles, with a pronounced concentration dependence (Fig. 2E). These RNAs exist as duplexes and their melting profiles are included for comparison with those of longer sequences and support our argumentation above. Both 8GA and 8m1GA show two-state melting behavior (as opposed to most of the RNAs discussed above) and the thermodynamic data can be determined reliably (Supplemental Fig. S2). Crystal structure of a 13-mer RNA duplex with tandem m22G:A pairs To gain insight into the conformational consequences of tandem m22G:A pairs in an RNA duplex and the geometrical differences between G:A and m22G:A base pairs, we determined the crystal structure of the 13m22GA duplex ° at 1.8 A resolution. The structure was determined by the Molecular Replacement technique using a canonical 12mer duplex with Watson­Crick base pairs as the search model. An example of the quality of the final electron density, as well as the sequence and numbering of residues, are depicted in Figure 3A (residues in strands 1 and 2 of the duplex are numbered G1 to U13 and G14 to U26, respectively).

All sugars are in the expected C39endo conformation, and the only change at the global level beside the widening in the center is a slight bend into the 2130

Terminal uridines are unstacked and engage in lattice interactions with neighboring duplexes (see Supplemental Fig. S3A,B). The base moiety of U13 is sandwiched between the phosphate group of G2# from a symmetry-related duplex and the 29-hydroxyl group of C17## from a third duplex (the distances between O1P# and ° O29## and the center of the uracil ring are 3.21 A and ° , respectively) (Supplemental Fig. S3A). In addition, 3.08 A the 29-hydroxyl group of U13 forms a hydrogen bond with ° the above phosphate oxygen (2.71 A). At the other end, U26 is tucked against the minor grooves of two neighboring duplexes (Supplemental Fig. S3B). In the case of the first symmetry mate (#), the interactions concern the center of the minor groove, in close vicinity to m22G:A pairs. The 29-hydroxyl group of U26 forms hydrogen bonds with both ° N3 and O29 of A7# (2.98 and 3.04 A, respectively) and, in addition, forms a contact to O29 of G22## from a second ° symmetry mate (distance 3.42 A). The 29-hydroxyl group # of A7 is also involved in a hydrogen bond with O39 (U26; ° 2.77 A).

creased (37°) relative to the average value of 33° for A-form RNA duplexes. The geometry of m22G:A pairs differs significantly from that of G:A base pairs. In order to compare the two, we used the G:A pairs in the 12GA duplex, whose crystal ° structure had previously been determined at 1.12 A resolution as a reference (Li et al. 2007). The 12GA duplex is located on a crystallographic twofold rotation axis in space group C2, and therefore the two G:A pairs assume an identical geometry. The two m22G:A pairs in the 13m22GA duplex, the G:A pair in the 12GA duplex, and a superimposition of the m22G6:A20 and the native pair are depicted in Figure 4. A common feature of these purine:purine pairs is the virtual absence of propeller twisting that amounts to about À15° on average for other base pairs in the two duplexes.

° to one of the N2-methyl groups of m22G19# (3.42 A; Supplemental Fig. S3B). The presence of tandem m22G:A pairs leads to several conformational changes at the local level. It is likely that some of them are not directly related to N2,N2-dimethylation of G, but are mere adjustments of the A-form sugarphosphate backbone required to accommodate the wider imino-type purine:purine pairs. For example, backbone torsion angles a, b, e, and z of G5 that is located 59adjacent to m22G:A pairs exhibit significant changes relative to the conformations of corresponding angles in all other residues (see Supplemental material file, output of the program CURVES [Lavery and Sklenar 1989]). The a angle adopts the -sc conformation, but is contracted by z10° (À58°), b changes from the ap conformation to +ac (139°), e (normally ap) becomes acÀ (À127°), and z opens up from Àsc to -ac (À112°). Interestingly, these variations occur in the same region as the kink into the major groove. Thus, it is possible that the angle changes underlie the compression of the major groove, and that bending provides an indication for an increased plasticity of the RNA duplex near tandem G:A pairs. Judging from the so-called local interbase parameters, the duplex is also underwound at that site, as the helical twist between base pairs G5:C21/ m22G6:A20 is only 14° (the roll of 21° and the shift, Dx, of ° ­1.8 A there represent the highest values for the respective parameters in the entire duplex). On the other hand, the twist at the adjacent m22G6:A20/A7:m22G19 step is in-

(Fig. 4A). The base-pair opening amounts to À10° (toward the major groove), and no appreciable shearing between the G and A bases was observed. Conversely, the lengths of the above hydrogen bonds in m22G:A pairs are different; the (G)N1-H. . .N1(A) bond is longer than the (G)O6. . .H° ° N6(A) bond (3.24 A vs. 2.75 A in the m22G6:A20 pair and ° ° 3.15 A vs. 2.84 A in the A7:m22G19 pair). The m22G6:A20 pair displays an opening of À35° (Fig. 4B,D). The A7:m22G19 pair also shows a significant opening of 23° (Fig. 4C). Undoubtedly, the geometric perturbations in the N2,N2-dimethylated G:A pairs help minimize potentially repulsive interactions between methyl groups and atoms from paired or stacked residues. However, the lengthening of hydrogen bonds in m22G:A pairs comes at a price and can be expected to reduce RNA thermodynamic stability, consistent with the lower Tm values measured for duplexes with m22G:A pairs compared with those harboring G:A pairs. Water structure around m22G:A and G:A pairs and comparison with the geometry of the m22G26:A40 pair in tRNAs Hydration patterns around the native and N2,N2-dimethylated G:A pairs are depicted in Figure 4. As expected, the minor groove around m22G:A pairs is relatively dry. In principle, N3 of A can form a hydrogen bond to a water molecule. However, one of the dangling 39-terminal uridines of a neighboring duplex resides in the minor groove, in close vicinity to the tandem m22G:A pairs (see Supplemental Fig. S3B). Thus, N3 of A7# is engaged in a hydrogen-bonding interaction with O29 of U26 (see above). Thus, the presence of methyl groups disrupts the water structure in the center of the minor groove. In particular, water bridges with 29-hydroxyl groups from residues on opposite strands serving as bridgeheads are missing (Egli et al. 1996). The closest contacts involving N2-methyl groups are observed to C2-H of the pairing ° ° partner (3.45 A, m22G6. . .A20; 3.27 A, m22G19. . .A7) and the O2 keto oxygen atoms of cross-strand cytosines stacked ° ° above A7 (3.32 A, C8. . .m22G19) and A20 (3.81 A, ... 2 C21 m 2G6) (Fig. 5A). By comparison, the major groove exhibits a regular hydration pattern around both the G:A and m22G:A pairs (Fig. 4). Some of the observed changes may be due to the different resolutions at which the two ° ° structures were determined (1.12 A vs. 1.8 A). However, 2 the overall reduced hydration around m 2G:A pairs is consistent with the detrimental effect of methylation on thermodynamic stability. The single imino-hydrogen bonded m22G26:A44 pair in tRNA (i.e., tRNAPhe [Shi and Moore 2000]) exhibits a geometry that differs significantly from that of the tandem m22G:A pairs in the 13m22GA duplex. Unlike the tandem pairs that feature minimal propeller twist and buckling, the m22G26:A44 pair shows considerable propeller twisting and 2132

buckling. In addition, m22G26 exhibits a relatively loose stacking interaction with the adjacent C27 residue (Fig. 5B). Instead, the main stacking interaction is between m22G26 and m2G10. And, unlike with m22G:A pairs in the structure of the 13m22GA duplex, the lengths of hy° drogen bonds between (m22G)N1-H and N1(A) (2.87 A) 2 6 6 ° ) are nearly the same. and (m 2G)O and H-N (A) (2.84 A Thus, instead of base-pair shearing and opening as seen with tandem m22G:A pairs, propeller twisting and buckling here may serve to relieve a potentially short contact between the N2-methyl group and C2-H of A. No water molecules are found in the vicinity of methyl groups and ° the shortest contacts are to C2-H of A44 (3.26 A) and the 2 ° to the ring centroid). In imidazole ring of m G10 (3.29 A the latter case, the N2-methyl group pointing away from A44 sits directly above that ring of m2G10 and is most likely engaged in a stabilizing H. . .p interaction (Fig. 5B). CONCLUSIONS Methylation of nucleobases can affect RNA structure and function in multiple ways, i.e., by controlling secondary and/or tertiary structure and interactions with proteins. We show here that m22G has a destabilizing effect on RNA duplexes in cases where the N2,N2-dimethylated G forms an imino-hydrogen bonded pair with A. This destabilization occurs independently of whether m22G:A exists in an isolated form embedded in an otherwise canonical Watson­Crick base-paired stem or as part of a tandem in the central section of an RNA duplex. Depending on the

sequence context and the length of the RNA, m22G can drive the duplex-hairpin equilibrium toward the hairpin. Double methylation of the exocyclic amino group of guanine affects pairing with A in a variety of ways. The crystal structure of an RNA duplex with m22G:A pairs determined here reveals subtle changes of the iminohydrogen-bonded pairing geometry as a result of methylation. The observed differences in the case of tandem m22G:A pairs differ somewhat from those seen in the case of the single pair in many eukaryotic tRNAs. Nevertheless, our observations with regard to stability, pairing mode, and pairing geometry of m22G:A pairs support the conclusion that this G analog does not just prevent pairing of G26 with C in the tRNA D-stem, but also controls the pairing mode with A. Specifically, m22G rules out the common sheared orientation between G and A and limits the pairing mode to the more stable imino-hydrogen bonded form. MATERIALS AND METHODS Oligonucleotide synthesis and purification
The modified nucleotide phosphoramidites m1G and m22G were ¨ synthesized according to published procedures (Hobartner et al. 2003) and were incorporated into oligoribonucleotides by automated RNA solid-phase synthesis. In all cases, the synthesis was at the 1.3 mM scale and the ribose 29-hydroxyl group of the building blocks was protected by the [(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]methyl (TOM) group (Pitsch et al. 2001). All oligonucleotides were deprotected and cleaved from solid support using the following conditions: (1) CH3NH2 in ethanol (8 M, 700 mL) and CH3NH2 in water (41%, 700 mL) for 6 h; (2) TBAFÁ3H2O in THF (1 M, 950 mL) for 12 h; and (3) neutralization with triethylammonium acetate buffer in water (1 M, 950 mL). The samples were desalted using a Sephadex G10 column (30 3 1.5 cm), monitored by UV detection at 270 nm and elution with water, followed by evaporation to dryness. For purifications we used ion-exchange chromatography (semipreparative Dionex DNAPac column, 9 3 250 mm at 80°C, flow rate 2 mL/minute, detection at 265 nm) with buffers A and B being 25 mM Tris-HCl, 6 M urea, in water (pH 8.0), and 25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaOCl4, 6 M urea, in water (pH 8.0), respectively. Following purification, fractions were desalted once again by loading onto a C18 SepPak cartridge (Waters/Millipore), followed by elution with aqueous 0.1­0.2 M (Et3NH)HCO3 and then water/CH3CN (6:4, v/v). The combined fractions containing the oligonucleotide triethylammonium salts were lyophilized to dryness and analyzed by MALDI-TOF.

cycle at a rate of 0.7°C/minute. Melting transitions were reversible for all sequences and essentially the same with respect to the four different wavelengths. Tm values were determined by calculating the first derivative (all corresponding curves depicted in the Supporting Information) and represent the mean of at least three individual measurements. Variation of Tm values within such a series was always less than 60.2 K. Sample preparation: Oligonucleotides were lyophilized to dryness, dissolved in the corresponding buffer from stock solutions, and subsequently degassed in the quartz cuvette. A layer of silicon oil was placed on the surface of the solution.

Crystallization and diffraction data collection
The concentrations of oligonucleotide stock solutions were adjusted to z1 mM in water, and crystallization experiments were performed with the Nucleic Acid Miniscreen (Hampton Research) (Berger et al. 1996) using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique. Diffraction-quality crystals could only be grown for the self-complementary 13-mer with central tandem m22G:A mismatches. Crystals for diffraction data collection were obtained from 2-mL droplets containing 0.5 mM oligonucleotide, 5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 20 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0), 6 mM spermine-4HCl, and 40 mM sodium chloride, that were equilibrated against a reservoir of 1 mL of 35% MPD at 291 K. Crystals appeared in about a week's time. Crystals were mounted in cryo-loops without further protection and diffraction data were collected at 120 K on the bending magnet beamline of the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT, 22BM) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). Data were processed with XGEN (Howard 2000) and selected crystal data and data collection parameters are summarized in Table 2.

Structure determination and refinement
The structure was determined by the Molecular Replacement method with the program MOLREP (CCP4 1994; Vagin and Teplyakov 1997) using a canonical A-RNA dodecamer search model (residues U13 and U26 omitted) that was generated with the program TURBO-FRODO (Cambillau and Roussel 1997). Initial refinement cycles were carried out with the program CNS (Brunger et al. 1998) by performing simulated annealing, followed by a few cycles of gradient minimization and refinement of individual isotropic temperature factors. Water molecules (z15 in each cycle) were added into regions of superimposed (2FoÀFc) sum and (FoÀFc) difference Fourier electron density after the gradient minimization cycles. At this stage, the terminal uridine residues (U13 and U26) could be clearly traced in the electron density map. Further isotropic and TLS refinements (Winn et al. 2001) were performed using the program REFMAC (Murshudov et al. 1997), followed by inspection of the electron density and addition of water molecules. After additional cycles of refinement, the N2,N2-dimethylguanosine residues were added and the dictionary file for REFMAC adapted. The dictionary file was generated with the program PRODRG (version 041117.0531; Schuettelkopf and van Aalten 2004) and the refinement mode was then made anisotropic. After reaching an Rfree of 0.277, all reflections were included in the final rounds of refinement. Final refinement parameters are listed in Table 2. Illustrations in Figures www.rnajournal.org

UV melting experiments
Absorbance versus temperature profiles were recorded at 250, 260, 265, and 270 nm on a Varian Cary-1 spectrophotometer equipped with a multiple cell holder and a Peltier temperature-control device. Each oligonucleotide was measured at four or five different concentrations ranging from about 1 to 100 mM in buffer solutions of 10 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.0) containing 150 mM NaCl. Data were collected after a complete cooling and heating
