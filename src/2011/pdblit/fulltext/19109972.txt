Abstract--The two Neurospora crassa catalase genes cat­1 and cat­3 were shown to encode Cat­1 and Cat­3 large monofunctional catalases. cat­1 and cat­3 genes are regulated differentially during the asexual life cycle and under stress conditions. A stepwise increase in catalase activity occurs during conidiation. Conidia have 60 times more catalase activity than exponentially growing hyphae. Cat­1 activity was predominant in conidia, during germination and early exponential growth. It was induced during prestationary growth and by ethanol or heat shock. Cat­3 activity was predominant during late exponential growth and at the start of the conidiation process. It was induced under stress conditions, such as H2O2, paraquat, cadmium, heat shock, uric acid, and nitrate treatment. In general, Cat­1 activity was associated with nongrowing cells and Cat­3 activity with growing cells. The Cat­3 N-terminus sequence indicates that this catalase is processed and presumably secreted. Paraquat caused modification and degradation of Cat­1. Under heat shock both Cat­1 and Cat­3 were modified and degraded and Cat­1 was resynthesized. Paraquat and heat shock effects were observed only in the presence of air and are probably related to in vivo generation of singlet oxygen. Purified Cat­3 was modified with a photosensitizing reaction in which singlet oxygen is produced. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

INTRODUCTION

The asexual life cycle of the ascomycete Neurospora crassa has been used as a model to study cell differentiation [1,2]. When growing hyphae in a liquid medium are filtered and the resulting mycelial mat is exposed to air, a synchronous process of conidiation is started. Hyphae in direct contact with air adhere to each other during the first 40 min. Aerial hyphae begin to grow from the adhered hyphae after 2 h of air exposure. The tips of aerial hyphae start forming conidia after 8 ­9 h air exposure. A hyperoxidant state is detected at the start of each of these morphogenetic transitions. A hyperoxidant state is defined as an unstable, transient state in which reactive oxygen species surpass the antioxidant capacity of the cell [3,4]. In each transition, massive total protein oxiAddress correspondence to: Wilhelm Hansberg, M.D., Ph.D., Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Fisiologia Celular, Universidad ´ ´ Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Apartado Postal 70-242, 04510 Mex´ ´ ´ ico City, D.

dation and degradation is detected [5] and specific enzyme oxidation takes place [6]. Loss of NAD(P)H reducing power, glutathione disulfide excretion, and glutathione oxidation characterizes the conidiation process [7,8]. Oxygen dependent chemiluminescence is detected and antioxidants inhibit chemiluminescence and cell differentiation [9]. Induction of catalase and other antioxidant mechanisms is an expected consequence of a hyperoxidant state [4]. Jacob and Orme-Johnson [10] characterized a catalase activity from N. crassa. This catalase is induced by nitrate and was reported to contain a high-spin ferric dihydroporphyrin [10,11]. Chary and Natvig [12] described the presence of three catalases in N. crassa that are differentially expressed during the asexual life cycle and in response to different stress conditions. Lledias et ´ al. [13,14] reported that catalases are oxidized in vitro and in vivo by singlet oxygen (1O2), giving rise to different catalase activity bands in zymograms. To determine the role of catalases in cell differentiation, it is important to establish the correspondence of genes and

catalase activities and the conditions under which the different catalase activities are induced and/or oxidized. Here we determined the correspondence of cat­1 and cat­3 genes with the two large monofunctional catalases of N. crassa, Catalase­1 (Cat­1) and Catalase­3 (Cat­3). A third catalase activity and gene correspond to a catalase-peroxidase called Catalase­2 [15]. A fourth gene predicting a catalase found in the N. crassa genome (Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research) (www.genome.wi.mit.edu) has not been characterized. Accumulation of mRNA and regulation of Cat­1 and Cat­3 activities during the asexual life cycle and under stress conditions was determined. Paraquat added to a culture caused modification and disappearance of Cat­1. Under heat shock conditions, both Cat­1 and Cat­3 were modified and probably degraded. However, these effects were only observed in the presence of air. The in vitro and in vivo electrophoretic mobility shift of catalases was only observed under conditions in which 1O2 is generated ([13,14] and this report), suggesting that 1O2 is probably formed under heat shock and paraquat treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Gel electrophoresis One-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was done according to the Laemmli method but without sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS); samples had no -mercaptoethanol and were not boiled. For the two dimensional PAGE, the isoelectrofocusing was done in 5.5% acrylamide gel in capillaries, containing the following ampholites: 0.75% pH 3.5­10, 5%, pH 4.0 ­ 6.6, 1.7% pH 5.0 ­7.0, and 0.8%, pH 2.5­5.0. Samples contained 1% pH 3.5­10 and 5% pH 4 ­ 6.5 ampholites and 15% glycerol. H3PO4 12 M was used as anolyte and 20 M NaOH as catolyte and electrophoresis was run in a MiniProtean II (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) chamber 10 min at 500 V followed by 3.5 h a 750 V. One millimeter thick plate gels were cast with the gels of the first dimension layered on top and were run at 150 V for 2.5 h. After the two-dimensional electrophoresis, gels were fixed and stained for catalase activity. Position in the stained gels was determined with purified Cat­1 and Cat­3. Catalase induction during the cell cycle and under different stress conditions Catalase induction during the cell cycle was measured in 10 ml liquid cultures grown from 3 105 conidia/ml, incubated at 30°C and 150 rpm. At different times, cultures were recovered by filtration, half of each culture was ground in liquid nitrogen for total RNA isolation, and the other half was treated with acetone and used for determination of catalase activity. Ten milliliter cultures grown from 3 105 conidia/ml in 400 ml Vogel's medium, at 30°C, 200 rpm, were filtered and immediately transferred into 10 ml of fresh medium plus one of the following compounds: 10 mM H2O2, 5 mM paraquat, 0.35 M CaCO3, 0.66 mM FeSO4-7H20, 2.52 mM CuSO4, 0.15 mM CdSO4, 1 M NaCl, or 1 M sorbitol. Other cultures were heat shocked at 43°C, incubated without a carbon source, or with 4% ethanol as a sole carbon source, without a nitrogen source, or with 4.76 mM uric acid as a sole nitrogen source. Induction of catalase by NaNO3 was performed according to Jacob and OrmeJohnson [10]. After each treatment samples were processed as described above. Conidiation was induced using mycelium grown from 1 106 conidia/ml in 400 ml, incubated for 15 and 20 h at 30°C, 200 rpm. Ten or 50 ml of culture were filtered and exposed to the air [1]. Adhered and aerial mycelia were isolated and divided into two parts for RNA isolation and catalase activity determination.

Strains and culture conditions The 74-ORS23-1A wild type strain obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC) was grown in Vogel's minimal medium supplemented with sucrose. Catalase activity Catalase (hydrogen peroxide:hydrogen peroxide oxido-reductase) (EC 1.11.1.6) activity was measured by determining the initial rate of dioxygen production with a Clark microelectrode [16]. Reaction was started by injecting catalase, usually 5 l or less, into a sealed chamber filled with 2 ml of 10 mM of H2O2 in 10 mM phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.8 adjusted by mixing Na2HPO4 and KH2PO4 solutions. Units (U) are defined as moles O2 produced per min per mg protein under these conditions. Activity was measured in samples just before loading them on a gel for electrophoresis. Catalase activity in polyacrylamide gels was determined by incubating the gel after electrophoresis, 5 min in 5% methanol and then, after rinsing three times with tap water, 10 min in 10 mM H2O2. The gel, rinsed with tap water, was incubated in a 1/1 mixture of freshly prepared 2% potassium ferric cyanide and 2% ferric chloride. Blue color developed in the gel except at zones where H2O2 was decomposed by catalase [12,17]. Staining was stopped by soaking the gel in a 10% acetic acid and 5% methanol solution.

The sequence was cloned into pCRII (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) yielding pSM7, which was used to hybridize the Orbach/ Sachs cosmid library (FGSC). Cosmid D8, E3, E12, F10 Y H7 gave a positive signal and all gave the same digestion pattern with EcoRI, HindIII and KpnI in a Southern blot assay. The H7 cosmid was used for direct sequencing of cat­1 using the Sanger automatic fluorescent sequencing method (ABI PRISM310 from Perkin-Elmer); sequences were assembled using the GCG software. cat­1 sequence was deposited in the GeneBank under accession number AY027545. Cloning of genomic cat­3 A chromosomal DNA KpnI fragment (10.4 kDa) from N. crassa containing an open reading frame (ORF) that had similarities to catalases was cloned into a pUC19. The cat­3 gene was identified using a portion of the cat­R gene of Aspergillus niger [18] in heterologous hybridization experiments employing a N. crassa cosmid library [19] (FGSC). A cosmid (G11H8) carrying the cat­3 gene was mapped to the right arm of linkage group III by restriction polymorphism map analysis [20]. This position is consistent with the location of the gene previously designated cat­1 [12]. The cat­3 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcripttion-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with 3 RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends (GIBCOBRL, Rockville, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer 5 -CCCCATATGCGTGTCAACGCTCTT-3 containing the ATG of cat­3 and a NdeI restriction site was used to amplify a 2.3 kb product using total RNA and the Elongase enzyme mix from GIBCO. This sequence was amplified and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBKS to yield pSM1. The genomic and cDNA of cat­3 were sequenced by the Sanger method and assembled using the GCG software. cat­3 sequence was deposited in the GeneBank under accession number AY027544. Isolation of nucleic acids and hybridization analyses Total RNA was isolated with TRIZOL (GIBCO-BRL) according to manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of RNA was loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and run at 60 V. Nucleic acids were transfer to Hybond-XL membranes (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) with a Vacuum Blotter (BIORAD) according to manufacturer's instructions and fixed

with UV light. Hybridization analysis was carried out with a 2.3 kb SpeI cat­3 cDNA fragment from pSM1 and a 600 bp EcoRI cat­1 fragment from pSM7. Probes were labeled with the Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany). In vivo and in vitro modification of catalases Fifty milliliters from liquid culture grown for 15 h from 106 conidia/ml were transferred to fresh medium containing 5 mM paraquat or subjected to a heat shock of 48°C [12]. Some cultures were aerated by agitation at 300 rpm, others were put in closed Falcon tubes filled to avoid any air chamber. Purified Cat­3 was modified by a photosensitization reaction [13]. Cat­3 (50 U/10 l) in 10 mM PB containing 10 mM uric acid was illuminated with a fluorescent light source (0.4 W/cm2) in the presence of 1.37 mM riboflavin. Histidine (30 mM) and 5-aminosalisylic acid (5 mM) were used as quenchers of singlet oxygen. Catalases were separated by PAGE, loading 50 U of catalase activity in each lane, and analyzed by zymogram.
RESULTS

Increased catalase activities during conidiation Catalase activity increased during the stationary growth phase. Activity was higher in adhered hyphae than in growing mycelia and even higher in aerial hyphae. Conidia had 60 times more catalase activity than growing mycelium (Fig. 1A). Cell extracts of the different cell structures analyzed by PAGE under nondenaturing conditions gave different bands of catalase activity in the gel (Fig. 1B). The band of lower mobility corresponds to Cat­1 that is accumulated in conidia. Cat­1 is oxidized by singlet oxygen giving rise to more acidic enzyme conformers [13]. Some of these bands, Cat­1c and Cat­1e, are observed in the adhered hyphae, aerial hyphae, and conidia (Fig. 1B). In the zymograms, the partially oxidized Cat­1c co-migrated with Cat­3 activity. A third catalase activity, Cat­2, exhibited a higher electrophoretic mobility than Cat­1 and Cat­3 and appeared in aerial hyphae and in conidia (Fig. 1B). Cat­2 is a typical catalase-peroxidase similar in sequence and biochemistry to the bacterial enzymes [15]. Cat­1 and Cat­3 are regulated differentially during the asexual life cycle To determine which catalase activities are present throughout the asexual life cycle, cell extracts from the different cell structures were analyzed by zymograms

using two-dimensional PAGE. Cat­1 was the main catalase activity in conidia, during germination of conidia, and initial growth (Fig. 2). The low amount of Cat­3 activity in conidia disappeared during germination and reappeared after several hours of filamentous growth. At the end of the exponential growth phase, Cat­3 was the predominant catalase activity; Cat­1 was a minor component (Fig. 2). Cat­3 activity increased with adhesion of the mycelium. Adhesion marks the start of the conidiation process and aerial hyphae grow from the adhered mycelium [1]. Both enzymes coexisted in aerial hyphae. Concurrent to conidia formation, Cat­1 activity increased and accumulated in conidia (Fig. 2) [4]. Cloning of cat­1 and sequence comparison with other catalases Based on the amino acid sequence of two Cat­1 peptides, degenerate oligonucleotides were designed and used for PCR reactions. A 600 bp genomic DNA fragment was then used to obtain the entire cat­1 gene from a cosmid

A long ORF predicts a large catalase that corresponds to the Cat­1 activity (see below). cat­1 is in contig 2.552 (Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research) (www.genome.wi.mit.edu); the nearest marker is con-6 (contig 2.549) of chromosome II. Amino acids for heme binding and for activity are conserved in the catalases shown in Fig. 3. Cat­1 amino acid sequence is 76% identical to Podospora anserina CatA (AJ011298), 64% to Aspergillus fumigatus CatA (U87630) [21], and 60% to Aspergillus nidulans CatA (U37803) [22]. Two in frame ATG codons could generate a Cat­1 of 765 or 736 amino acids and 85,511 or 82,263 Da.

Sequenced peptides are labeled in light gray; intron position in the corresponding gene; active site amino acid;  amino acid for heme binding.

By sequence comparison of the homologous catalases, introns in cat­1 were deduced. The cat­1 has only one intron and it has the consensus signal sequences for processing. This intron position is conserved among P. anserina catA and A. fumigatus catA but is not conserved in A. nidulans catA. A second conserved intron in A. fumigatus and A. nidulans genes was absent in cat­1. Cloning of cat­3 and amino acid sequence comparison with other catalases A chromosomal DNA KpnI fragment from N. crassa containing a putative catalase gene was cloned, sequenced and subjected to ORF analysis. A long ATG-initiating ORF predicts a catalase of 716 amino acids (78,850 Da) that corresponds to Cat­3 activity (see below). cat­3 is in contig 2.42 (Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research) (www.genome.wi.mit.edu) the nearest marker is mip­1 in chromosome III. The predicted Cat­3 sequence is

73% identical to P. anserina CatB (AJ01130), 68% to Claviceps purpurea Cat1 (AJ001386) [23], 63% to A. nidulans CatB (U80672) [24], and 62% to A. fumigatus CatB (U87850) [25]. Amino acids important for binding of the heme and for activity are conserved in all these catalases (Fig. 4). A putative signal peptide consisting of a highly hydrophobic and basic sequence at the N-terminus is present in all of them (Fig. 4) and is probably used for secretion [21,23] (see below). A cat­3 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and the resulting DNA fragment was cloned and sequenced. cat­3 has two introns with consensus splice signals. The first intron is conserved in all five catalase shown in Fig. 4; the second intron is present only in C. purpurea cat­1. Primer extension experiments indicate that cat­3 transcription initiates at 250, 87, 36, and 11 (not shown). Other minor sites are rather improbable starting sites. The termination and poly­adenylation sites were determined by sequence analysis (AY027544).

cat­1 encodes Catalase­1 and cat­3 encodes Catalase­3 N. crassa has four catalase activities. To establish the correspondence between genes and activities, three N. crassa catalases were purified and N-terminal or internal peptide amino acid sequence determined. Purified Cat­1 was digested with endolysin-C and the resulting peptides were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). One 15 and

two 12 amino acid long sequences are predicted by the sequence in Fig. 3, indicating that cat­1 gene encodes Cat­1. Only 5­10% of the analyzed Cat­3 for the N-terminus generated a 27 amino acid sequence that correspond to a processed Cat­3 enzyme (Fig. 4). The rest of the catalase seemed to have a blocked N-terminus. To eliminate a possible contamination with another catalase, an internal peptide of Cat­3 was sequenced. The sequence of 18

In aerial hyphae cat­3 mRNA was detected at the start of conidiation (8 ­9 h) and decreased afterwards, and cat­1 increased when conidia are formed and thereafter (10 ­18 h) (Fig. 5B). Regulation of cat­1 and cat­3 under stress conditions Growing mycelium was subjected to different stress conditions and, after 3 or 6 h under stress, total catalase activity and zymograms, and cat­1 and cat­3 mRNA levels were determined. There was a substantial increase in total catalase activity with paraquat and heat shock, and a moderate increase with uric acid and transition metal ions. Other stress conditions produced no or only slight changes in total catalase activity (Fig. 6). Increased Cat­1 activity and accumulation of cat­1 was observed with high salt and with ethanol as sole carbon source (Fig. 6, lanes 9 and 13). Under the other stress conditions, cat­1 mRNA decreased or disappeared. Cat­3 activity and cat­3 mRNA accumulation increased with H2O2, paraquat, cadmium, heat shock, uric acid, and nitrate. The induction of Cat­3 and cat­3 mRNA by paraquat was higher than with H2O2 (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4). A high concentration of CaCO3 in the growth medium increases catalase activity due to H2O2 production by induced glucose oxidase activity [26]. Under such condition accumulation of cat­3 mRNA also increased (Fig. 6, lane 5). Transition metal ions, such as Cu(II), Fe(II) and Cd(II), increased Cat­3 activity, but after 6 h cat­3 mRNA accumulation was only observed with cadmium (Fig. 6, lanes 6 ­ 8). High salt did not affect Cat­3 activity and sorbitol decreased it. Heat shock increased Cat­3 activity and accumulation of its mRNA (Fig. 6, lane 11). Other stress conditions assayed included carbon starvation, growth with ethanol as a sole carbon source, nitrogen starvation, and growth with uric acid as a sole nitrogen source. Only in the last condition was increased Cat­3 activity and cat­3 mRNA accumulation observed (Fig. 6, lane 15). In comparison to ammonium, nitrate as nitrogen source increased Cat­3 activity and cat­3 mRNA accumulation (Fig. 6, lanes 16 and 17). Cat­1 and Cat­3 are modified during the asexual life cycle and under stress conditions Cat­1 is modified in vitro and in vivo conditions when singlet oxygen is formed [13,14]. During the asexual cell cycle, mobility changes of Cat­1 and Cat­3 were observed (Fig. 2). For Cat­1 this was particularly evident in conidia and after 6 h germination; Cat­3 modification was always observed but not when it is synthesized after 6 h germination. A mixture of unmodified and modified Cat­3 was observed in the adhered hyphae (Fig. 2).

(B) Northern analysis using cat­1 and cat­3 cDNA as probes and total RNA from adhered mycelium and aerial mycelium at different times. rRNA is shown as a loading control.

amino acids from an endolysin-C digestion peptide confirmed the correspondence between Cat­3 and the predicted sequence from cat­3 (Fig. 4). Because the five catalases shown in Fig. 4 contain a putative signal peptide for secretion, our results suggest that Cat­3 is processed at the amino terminus for secretion. Regulation of cat­1 and cat­3 during the N. crassa life cycle Only cat­1 mRNA was accumulated in conidia, but disappeared at the start of germination (Fig. 5A). However, cat­3 mRNA is observed in germinating conidia when subjected to stress conditions such as intense light, a source of singlet oxygen, or when carotenes are absent [14] (see below). cat­3 mRNA appeared in growing mycelia (9 h), accumulated in the late exponential growth phase (18 ­24 h) and decreased in the stationary growth phase (Fig. 5A). cat­1 mRNA progressively accumulated during the prestationary and early stationary growth phase (18 ­33 h) and decreased thereafter (Fig. 5A). cat­3 and cat­1 mRNA were present during adhesion of hyphae (Fig. 5B), and both diminished after 1 h.

Fig. 6. Cat­1 and Cat­3 in mycelia under different stress conditions. Grown mycelium was transferred into fresh medium and subjected to stress conditions for 3 or 6 h. Half of each culture was used for catalase activity determination and the other half for RNA extraction and northern analysis. Bars indicate catalase specific activity, below bars there are zymograms and northern blots using either cat­1 or cat­3 cDNA as probes and rRNA as loading control. Lanes 1 and 2, without stress for 3 or 6 h; stress conditions for 3 or 6 h, indicated in each lane, were: 10 mM H2O2; 5 mM paraquat; 0.35 M CaCO3; 0.66 mM FeSO4-7H2O; 2.52 mM CuSO4; 0.15 mM CdSO4; 1 M NaCl; 1 M sorbitol: HS heat shock at 43°C; C( ) without a carbon source; EtOH 4% ethanol as a sole carbon source; N( ) without nitrogen source; uric acid 4.76 mM uric acid as a sole nitrogen source; NH4 grown in NH4Cl as nitrogen source; NO3 grown in Na2NO3 as nitrogen source.

Stress conditions in which Cat­3 was induced were tested for modification of Cat­1 and Cat­3. Paraquat is a redox cycling compound that requires the presence of O2. Thus, paraquat was added to a culture in the presence or absence of air. In the course of 6 h in air, Cat­1 activity disappeared, and there was a marked increase in Cat­3 plus Cat­1c activity. This latter change was not observed in the absence of air (Figs. 7A and 7B). Catalase activities from heat shocked cultures in the presence or absence of air were analyzed by PAGE and zymograms of the gels. Catalase activity increased during the first 3 h of heat shock. During this period, most of Cat­1 and Cat­3 underwent a shift in electrophoretic mobility. These effects were only observed in the presence of air (Figs. 7C and CD, lane 5). Cat­1 reappeared after 6 h of heat shock and a prominent smear indicated the generation of modified catalase conformers (Fig. 7C, lane 6). No changes were apparent in the zymograms in the absence of air. These results suggest that under heat

shock induction, modification, and turnover of catalases depend on the presence of O2. Because catalase oxidation (Cat­1 and Cat­2) has been only observed under conditions in which singlet oxygen is produced [13,14], purified Cat­3 was subjected to a photosensitization reaction that produces singlet oxygen. After 3 h in the presence of riboflavin and light, the electrophoretic mobility of Cat­3 increased (Fig. 7E) similarly to other catalases. The presence of singlet oxygen quenchers such as histidine and 5­aminosalicylic acid prevented this change.

DISCUSSION

Two catalase genes cat­1 and cat­3 were cloned and the corresponding enzymes Cat­1 and Cat­3 identified. Regulation of these enzyme activities during the asexual life cycle of N. crassa and under stress conditions was

determined. Both catalases were oxidized in vivo probably by the reaction of 1O2 with the porphyrin. Catalase genes and activities The two genes reported encode large catalases ( 80 kDa monomer). Like N. crassa, A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, and P. anserina, also have two large catalases ([21,22,24,25], AJ011298; AJ011309). These enzymes belong to a family of catalases from bacteria and fungi that have a flavodoxin-like domain at their C-terminal [27]. In contrast to small catalases ( 60 kDa monomer), the presence of this domain impairs binding of NADPH in large catalases [28,29]. At the protein level overall sequence identity between Cat­1 and Cat­3 is 36%, with only 29% sequence identity in the C-terminal domains. If the C-terminal is not considered, sequence identity rises to 44%. Despite this relative low similarity, the threedimensional structure of the C-terminal domain from both enzymes is very similar among them and similar to the corresponding HPII from Escherichia coli ([30], Diaz ´

et al., in preparation). The function of this domain remains to be determined. In contrast to small catalases, Cat­1 and Cat­3 are thermo- and photo-resistant and withstand denaturation by extreme pH and high concentrations of denaturants [31]. Both enzymes have a chlorin instead of ferroprotoheme IX [11,13], both endure molar concentrations of H2O2 and have a lower sensitivity to azide inactivation ([31], Diaz et al., unpublished). ´ The sequence of the Cat­3 N-terminus and of the processed enzyme indicates that this catalase is probably secreted. Catalases homologous to Cat­3 have a similar signal peptide that is processed for secretion [3,21]. In fact, catalase activity was detected in the growth medium, which could correspond to Cat­3. cat­1 has two in frame translation initiating codons. Alignment with the Cat­1 homologues (Fig. 3) and test code prediction favors the second initiation site. Besides, only this site is in the right context (CCCACCAUG). Thus, translation from the first site is unlikely. If translated from the second site, Cat­1 would still have a long

and loose N-terminus, similar to the homologous E. coli HPII. No defined electron density for the first 26 amino acids was found in the HPII crystallographic structure [30]. This was also observed in the Cat­1 structure (Diaz ´ et al., in preparation). The N-terminus of the Cat­1 does not have a recognizable signal peptide, however, the enzyme was found to be associated mainly to the cell wall of conidia [32]. Because both enzymes are at least partially extracellular, their resistance could be related to the harsh conditions of the environments where fungi germinate and grow. In contrast, small catalases in animal cells only require acid resistance for their peroxisomal localization. Catalase regulation during the asexual life cycle and under stress conditions Cat­1 and Cat­3 are present throughout the asexual life cycle of N. crassa but are expressed differentially. Due to its accumulation in conidia, Cat­1 accounts for most of the activity during germination and initiation of growth. The homologous catalase of Cat­1 in A. nidulans, CatA, is specifically accumulated in spores and conidia from a CatA mutant strain are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide [22]. This indicates the importance of catalase for germination in substrates, such as plant material, that can generate considerable amounts of hydrogen peroxide through NADPH oxidase [33]. Cat­1 was the main activity during the early exponential growth phase in nutrient liquid medium under non-stressed conditions. On the other hand, during the late exponential growth phase, Cat­3 was the predominant activity and cat­3 mRNA accumulated. However, a low level of Cat­1 activity was always present during growth. In the prestationary growth phase when growth is restricted by increasing limitation of nutrients, the Cat­1 and cat­1 mRNA increased. There was a stepwise increase in catalase activity from the growing mycelium to the quiescent conidium. A hyperoxidant state is generated at the start of each morphogenetic transition of the conidiation process [3,4]. Thus, an increase in catalase activity with the appearance of each differentiated cell structure is an expected consequence of a recurrent hyperoxidant state during the conidiation process. In aerial hyphae, cat­3 mRNA increased transiently at the start of conidiation. The largest increase in catalase activity occurs after formation of conidia when cat­1 mRNA is accumulated and Cat­1 builds up to constitute 0.6% of total conidial protein [31]. At the start of germination a hyperoxidant state is developed; this leads to total protein oxidation. The apparent Cat­1 turnover increases in conidia subjected to stress conditions that can generate singlet oxygen [14]. When these results were published only one gene had

been detected (Baldwin, J. L., and D. O. Natvig, Abstr. 18th Fungal Genetics Conf., abstr. 15, p. 31, 1995) and it was suggested that under those stress conditions it was cat­1 mRNA the one accumulated [14]. With the identification of the two genes encoding Cat­1 and Cat­3 (this report), we now know that the mRNA accumulated in conidia under stress corresponds to Cat­3, and not Cat­1. Cat­3 activity and cat­3 mRNA increased in mycelia subjected to stress conditions, such as H2O2, paraquat, cadmium, heat shock, uric acid, and nitrate treatment. cat­1 mRNA accumulated only in a nutrient depleted medium or with an inadequate carbon source for N. crassa such as ethanol. Thus, both genes are differentially regulated during the asexual life-cycle and in response to stress conditions. Cat­3 activity probably increases when cells respond to stress conditions that can be rapidly compensated and growth is resumed. Cat­1 activity augments when cells have to respond to severe stress that impairs growth and a resistant cell structure for survival has to be made, such as arthrospores or conidia. Cat­3 associated to growing and Cat­1 to nongrowing conditions can be observed in the transition from exponential growth to the prestationary and early stationary growth phase, and in the transition from growing aerial hyphae to nongrowing conidiated aerial mycelium. In general, catalase activity in N. crassa is regulated at the level of mRNA concentration, in contrast to the A. nidulans CatA that is regulated at the level of translation [34]. However, catalase regulation also operates at the level of enzyme degradation (see below). Because both catalases are apparently very similar, it would be interesting to know if there are particular aspects that makes one more suitable for growing and the other for nongrowing cells. Alternatively, this regulation could only be a reflection of gene expression of a similar enzyme under different conditions. Because Cat­1 is present at a low level in a growing liquid culture, it would be interesting to determine if Cat­1 is localized to the nongrowing parts and Cat­3 to the growing tips of hyphae. Oxidation of catalases by 1O2 Cat­1 and all catalases so far tested are oxidized in vitro [13] and in vivo [14] under conditions in which singlet oxygen is generated. Modification was traced to the heme ([13], Diaz et al., in preparation). During the ´ asexual life, mobility changes of Cat­1 and Cat­3 were observed (Fig. 2). Further evidence that Cat­1 and Cat­3 are oxidized in vivo are presented in Fig. 7. Cat­1 was modified when growing mycelium is subjected to heat shock or paraquat. Paraquat treatment caused Cat­1 to disappear in the course of 6 h and heat shock for more

than 2 h produced a smear of Cat­1 activity. Rapid electrophoretic mobility shift of catalase occurs when singlet oxygen is produced; Cat­1 proteolysis was excluded and other reactive oxygen species do not modify the electrophoretic mobility of catalases [13,14]. Thus, changes observed in Figs. 7A and 7C probably indicate oxidation of Cat­1 and Cat­3 by singlet oxygen. With paraquat Cat­1 is oxidized and degraded, and Cat­3 is synthesized. Under heat shock both Cat­1 and Cat­3 are oxidized and degraded and Cat­1 is resynthesized. Total activity increased during the first 3 h and decreased thereafter, suggesting simultaneous synthesis and degradation. Cat­1 and Cat­3 activity is hardly affected upon modification by singlet oxygen (Fig. 7E) (Diaz et al., in preparation). In the absence of O2, no ´ changes were observed with paraquat or heat treatment, indicating O2 involvement in Cat­1 and Cat­3 modification. These experiments and previous dada suggest intracellular singlet oxygen formation [13,14]. Under photosensitization conditions that can form singlet oxygen, purified Cat­3 was modified giving rise to a more acidic enzyme conformer. The shift in electrophoretic mobility observed in Cat­3 is smaller than in Cat­1. The reason for this difference is not known. The results in Fig. 7 also suggest that modified Cat­3, like oxidized Cat­1, turns over more rapidly than the nonmodified enzymes. The half-life of the different enzyme conformers is currently being investigated.
