We report the discovery of potent benzamide inhibitors of 11 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 -HSD1). The optimization and correlation of in vitro and in vivo metabolic stability will be described. Through modifications to our initial lead 2, we discovered pyridyl compound 13. This compound has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile across three species and showed a dose-dependent decrease in adipose 11 -HSD1 activity in a monkey ex vivo pharmacodynamic model.
Introduction Glucocorticoids regulate glucose and lipid homeostasis, acting through intracellular glucocorticoid receptors in the liver, adipose, and brain tissues.1 Elevated levels of glucocorticoids can result in insulin resistance by impairment of insulin dependent glucose uptake, enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis, increased lipolysis, and the inhibition of insulin secretion from pancreatic -cells.2 As a result of sustained glucocorticoid excess, like that observed in Cushing's syndrome, patients can develop dyslipidemia, visceral obesity, and other symptoms of metabolic syndrome.3 The 11 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I (11 -HSD1a) enzyme catalyzes the conversion of cortisone to the active glucocorticoid hormone cortisol, thus regulating the local activation of glucocorticosteroid receptors (Figure 1).1 Its counterpart, 11 -HSD2, catalyzes the reverse reaction of cortisol to cortisone. Evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of selectively inhibiting 11 -HSD1 for the treatment of type II diabetes and obesity has been obtained from mouse genetic models. Fat-specific 11 -HSD1 transgenic mice developed symptoms of metabolic syndrome (i.e., increased levels of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and visceral fat accumulation).4 Conversely, 11 -HSD1 knockout mice showed impaired induction of gluconeogenetic enzymes, improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and resistance to obesity when fed a high fat diet.5 These data, coupled with the increasing incidence of obesity and diabetes today, have generated significant interest

from the pharmaceutical industry toward the development of an 11 -HSD1 inhibitor.6 As part of our drug discovery effort to develop small molecule inhibitors of 11 -HSD1, we aimed to identify a novel chemical series based in part on the structure-activity relationships (SARs) derived from our previously reported sulfonamide analogues (e.g., 1, Figure 2).6c Specifically, we envisioned that an amide moiety could serve as a suitable isosteric replacement of the sulfonamide core present in compound 1. Indeed, we discovered that benzamide compound 2 demonstrated potent activity toward full length recombinant human 11 -HSD1 (IC50 ) 1.3 nM).7 While the potency of compound 2 was satisfactory at this stage, the molecule demonstrated poor in vitro metabolic stability, which translated into poor in vivo rodent pharmacokinetics. Improvement of the unfavorable metabolic profile was our initial objective in progressing this new series. In addition to the necessary improvements in the pharmacokinetics of these benzamide 11 -HSD1 inhibitors, our paradigm for compound advancement required the demonstration of 11 -HSD1 activity in an ex vivo model. This report describes the evolution of benzamide compound 2 toward 11 -HSD1 inhibitors that exhibit improved pharmacokinetics and significant primate ex vivo activity. Chemistry Generally, benzamide inhibitors were prepared in two steps from the corresponding cyclohexanone intermediate as shown in Scheme 1. The incorporation of ethyl, cyclopropylmethyl, and cyclopropyl substituents on nitrogen was accomplished by reductive amination of cyclohexanone 3 (R1 ) H) with the appropriate amine. The cyclohexylamines 4 were then coupled to optically pure (S)-4-(1,1,1-trifluoro-2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)benzoic acid 17, prepared from 4-acetylbenzonitrile 16, using

standard amide coupling conditions to afford the targeted analogues 2, 8, and 9. Compound 7 was prepared via a different synthetic route starting from cyclohexylamine 5. Acylation of cyclohexylamine with trifluoroacetic anhydride, followed by reduction of the resultant amide carbonyl with borane, gave the N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)cyclohexylamine 6, which was coupled to (S)-4-(1,1,1-trifluoro-2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)benzoic acid 17 through intermediate formation of the more reactive acid chloride. The synthesis of 4-substituted cyclohexane benzamides was accomplished in a straightforward manner, starting with the appropriate 4-substituted cyclohexanone 3 (R1 * H) (Scheme 1). For compounds 10-12, the commercially available 4-phenyland 4-(4-cyano)phenylcyclohexanones (3, R1 ) Ph and 4-CNPh, respectively) were elaborated to the corresponding benzamides in two steps via reductive amination with cyclopropylamine followed by amide bond formation.8 For analogues 13 and 14, the 4-substituted cyclohexanone intermediates (3, R1 ) 3-pyridyl and CH2CH2CN, respectively) were prepared according to literature prodecures.9,10 The preparation of 4-fluorocyclohexanone 19, a precursor to derivative 15, was achieved in three steps from known 4-hydroxycyclohexyl benzoate 18 as detailed in Scheme 2.11 Results and Discussion All compounds were screened for 11 -HSD1 enzyme activity in a scintillation proximity assay (SPA).7 Select compounds were then tested for cellular activity in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293 or h293) that stably express recombinant fulllength human 11 -HSD1 and nontransfected human fat stromal cells (adipocytes) expressing endogenous levels of 11 -HSD1.12

In the cellular assays, inhibitors were tested in the presence and absence of human serum albumin (HSA) to measure the impact of protein binding. The 11 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase selectivity profile of compounds was determined by measuring 11 -HSD2 activity using the SPA assay and comparing the results to 11 -HSD1 enzyme activity. Initial characterization of compound 2 revealed that it was rapidly metabolized in vitro, showing nearly complete consumption in both human and rat liver microsomes after a 30 min incubation period.12 In vivo pharmacokinetic data also showed compound 2 to be rapidly cleared in rats (CL ) 3.1 L/h/kg). The identification and quantification of metabolites formed from human and rat liver microsomes (HLM and RLM, respectively) showed three major routes of oxidative metabolism: N-dealkylation (2a) and oxidation of both the N-ethyl (2b) and Ncyclohexyl (2c) substituents (Figure 3). Furthermore, the metabolite identification data revealed significant species differences. Specifically, N-dealkylation was primarily observed in humans, shown from quantification of 2a (26% from HLM and <1% from RLM). The amount of N-ethyl oxidation was comparable in both species (i.e., 2b); however, oxidation of the cyclohexyl ring occurred more extensively in rat, (2c, 62% from RLM vs 44% from HLM). With these data in hand, we sought to improve the metabolic stability of compound 2 via modifications to the ethyl and cyclohexyl substituents. We planned to use our in vitro assay to measure initial improvements in metabolic stability of synthesized compounds. Promising analogues would then be advanced to rodent pharmacokinetic studies. Analogues containing N-ethyl replacements were initially explored, and it was found that the different nitrogen substituents were generally tolerated in regard to potency (Table 1). Compound 8 showed a slight reduction in potency, especially in the cellular assays; however, this compound was tested as a racemic mixture. On the basis of our metabolite identification studies described above, we expected improvements in stability to be greater in human liver microsomes over rat liver microsomes. Indeed, compounds 7-9 all showed improvements in HLM stability, while no stability gains were observed when evaluated in the rat microsome assay. Compound 9, containing the N-cyclopropyl substituent, was found to be optimal in the HLM stability assay (81% remaining after 30 min). In addition to improved microsomal stability, the cyclopropyl-substituted analogue 9 showed a slight increase in potency (11 -HSD1 IC50 ) 0.8 nM) compared to the parent compound 2. Having improved the in vitro stability in human liver microsomes, we then turned our attention to the optimization of metabolic stability in rats. The N-cyclopropyl group was maintained in subsequent analogues, which was predicted to have an additive effect with any improvements made in rat microsomal stability. It was found that, in general, substitution at the 4-position on the cyclohexane ring resulted in significant improvements in microsomal stability. The stereochemistry of this substituent was determined to be important because only

the trans isomers showed improved microsomal stability. For example, the 4-phenyl trans derivative 10 was stable in both human and rat liver microsomes (>90% remaining after 30 min), while the corresponding cis analogue 11 was rapidly consumed (9% and <5% remaining in HLM and RLM after 30 min, respectively, Table 2). These results demonstrated that concomitant modifications to the N-ethyl and N-cyclohexane groups led to highly improved stability in the in vitro microsomal clearance assay in humans and rats, as predicted from the metabolic identification studies of parent compound 2. In addition to significant improvements measured in the microsomal stability assay, compounds containing a substituent at the 4-cyclohexane position were highly potent. It was found that trans aryl (10, 12), heteroaryl (13), alkyl (14), and fluorine (15) substituents were tolerated. The 4-phenyl cis analogue 11 showed slightly diminished 11 -HSD1 activity (5-fold) relative to the corresponding trans derivative 10 in the noncellular assay, and this result exemplified the general SAR trend for the cis and trans stereoisomers. A shift in potency was observed in h293 cells for all compounds tested, ranging from 2-fold to 17-fold. The cellular potency was further lowered in the presence of HSA, ranging from 4-fold to 21-fold. The potency profile of pyridyl compound 13 exemplified the general trend: 11 -HSD1 (SPA) IC50 ) 1.4 nM, h293 11 -HSD1 IC50 ) 5.8 nM (4-fold shift), and h293 (+3% HSA) 11 -HSD1 IC50 ) 124 nM (21-fold shift). 11 -HSD1 enzyme inhibition in the adipose tissue is believed to be important for achieving efficacy in vivo.4 Thus, we measured the ability for compounds to inhibit 11 -HSD1 activity in human adipocytes (Table 2). The -cyanoethyl analogue 14 showed exquisite potency across all assays, including in the adipocyte assay where subnanomolar potency of 0.2 nM was

measured. Typically, IC50 values measured in adipocytes were comparable to the noncellular biochemical potency data. The trans-4-substituted cyclohexane benzamides were also tested against the 11 -HSD2 enzyme in the SPA assay to determine 11 -HSD selectivity. In all cases, the compounds were inactive (>10 µM). Since compounds 12-14 demonstrated satisfactory in vitro metabolic stability, these compounds were examined in rodent pharmacokinetic experiments (Table 3). It was found that in vivo results exhibited a correlation to the in vitro microsomal stability data. For example, the 4-(4-cyano)phenyl derivative 12 was found to have a very low clearance in rats (CL ) 0.11 L/h/kg) as predicted from the rat liver microsome data (>90% remaining after 30 min). Analogues 13 and 14 were found to have moderate clearance in rats (CL ) 1.0 and 1.28 L/h/kg, respectively), also reflected in the in vitro data (Table 2). Further pharmacokinetic evaluation of compound 13 was carried out in two separate species, cynomolgus monkey and dog. The measured clearance of 13 in cynomolgus monkey and dog (CL ) 0.50 and 0.60 L/h/kg, respectively) was found to be about 2-fold lower than the rat clearance, which resulted in a low predicted clearance in humans based on allometric scaling.13 Pyridine analogue 13 had excellent oral bioavailability in rats (F ) 72%) and cynomolgus monkeys (F ) 64%), but the bioavailability in dogs was poor (4%).14 Overall, molecules 12 and 13 showed the most promising pharmacokinetic profiles, characterized by low clearances, long half-lives, and high exposures. In addition to the excellent potency and pharmacokinetic profile, compound 13 had suitable activity in a recombinant cynomolgus monkey 11 -HSD1 enzyme assay (IC50 ) 39 nM). We selected compound 13 for further evaluation in our cynomolgus ex vivo pharmacodymanic model in which we measured, in vitro, the 11 -HSD1 enzyme activity in intact fat tissues collected from animals dosed with the molecule. This ex vivo model is useful in that it can quantify the 11 -HSD1 activity not only in the tissue of choice but also at a time point of choice. In the ex vivo study, cynomolgus monkeys were dosed orally with 2 and 10 mg/kg of inhibitor 13. At 2 h postdose, the animals were sacrificed and the mesenteric fat tissue was removed. Following incubation of these tissues in media containing [3H]cortisone, 11 -HSD1 activity was measured through detection of tritiated cortisol levels using a scintillation proximity assay. Relative to controls, both dose groups showed a decrease in [3H]cortisol production in mesenteric fat, corresponding to an ED50 in cynomolgus monkey of 2 mg/kg12 (Figure 4). Compound exposure levels were measured to be approximately 2.5 times greater in the adipose (levels ranged from 1510 to 2890 ng/g) than in the plasma, which showed that the compound effectively distributed to the target fat tissue. These results demonstrated that inhibitor 13 was effective in

lowering 11 -HSD1 adipose activity in cynomolgus monkeys when administered orally. Insight into the binding mode of the benzamide class of 11 HSD1 inhibitors was obtained by X-ray crystallography, and the data were compared to our previously studied sulfonamide inhibitors (e.g., compound 20, Figure 5d).6c,15 Specifically, an X-ray cocrystal structure of compound 13 with human 11 HSD1 enzyme containing NADP cofactor was generated (Figure 5). Benzamide 13 binds in a V-shaped conformation in the steroid substrate binding pocket with the amide carbonyl forming a central hydrogen bond interaction with hydroxyl of S170 (Figure 5a), one of the three residues that define the catalytic triad for 11 -HSD1 activity.16 The rest of the molecule forms a number of van der Waals (VDWs) contacts with the enzyme as well as the cofactor NADP. The pyridine ring is positioned toward the solvent exposed area of the dimer interface region of the protein and does not make any specific interactions, which may explain the tolerability of polar groups at this position (Figure 5b). The cyclopropyl moiety forms close van der Waals interactions with the side chains of L171 and Y177 and the

backbone of L215, and the trifluoromethyl tertiary alcohol positions toward the cofactor NADP with the trifluoromethyl group in close VDWs contacts with T124, S125, L126, and A226. In comparison to the benzamide compound, our previously reported sulfonamide inhibitor 20 also binds in the active site with a similar V-shape binding mode.15 The cyclopropane carboxamide group points toward the dimer interface region,

similar to the area occupied by the pyridyl ring in 13 (Figure 5c). However, the isosteric sulfonamide core moiety does not form any direct hydrogen bond interactions to the catalytic triad residues, as observed in the cocrystal structure of inhibitor 13. Instead, the sulfonamide oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of A172, which represents a notable difference in the key binding interactions of the benzamide and sulfonamide inhibitors. Conclusion In summary, we have identified a novel class of 11 -HSD1 inhibitors containing a benzamide core structure. Our initial lead compound 2, in the benzamide series, was highly potent, but showed poor metabolic stability. Significant improvements in metabolic stability were achieved by identifying the primary metabolites of compound 2 and utilizing these data to systematically modify the proposed structural liabilities. Modification of the parent compound 2, which included incorporation of an N-cyclopropyl group and a trans-disposed substituent at the 4-position on the N-cyclohexyl ring, resulted in dramatically improved metabolic stability, as exemplified by compound 13. In vitro microsomal stability data were predictive of pharmacokinetics and were used as a tool to select compounds for in vivo experiments. Pyridyl compound 13 possessed a desirable pharmocokinetic profile in three different species (rat, cynomolgus monkey, and dog) and was demonstrated to be orally efficacious in lowering adipose 11 -HSD1 activity in a monkey ex vivo model. Finally, X-ray cocrystallographic data of compound 13 with 11 -HSD1 revealed key interactions important for inhibitor binding. Experimental Section
Unless otherwise noted, all materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without purification. Dry organic

solvents (DriSolv) were purchased from EMD Chemicals and packaged under nitrogen in Sure Seal bottles. Reactions were monitered using thin-layer chromatography on 250 µm plates or using Agilent 1100 series LCMS with UV detection at 254 nm and a low resonance electrospray mode (ESI). Purification of title compounds was accomplished by flash column chromatography using silica gel 60 (particle size 0.04-0.063 mm, 230-400 mesh) or medium pressure liquid chromatography on a CombiFlash Companion (Teledyne Isco) with RediSep normal phase silica gel. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer (400 or 500 MHz) at ambient temperature, with the exception of compounds 2, 7, and 8, which were recorded at 120 °C.

It should be noted that in most cases, reductive amination of 4-substituted cyclohexanones typically gave a 1:1 mixture of cis and trans amines, which were readily separable by column chromatography. For compounds 10, 11, and 15, separation of the cis and trans isomers was accomplished via flash column chromatography after amide bond formation (see Supporting Information for additional details).
