Abstract Cu-containing nitrite reductases (NiRs) perform the reduction of nitrite to NO via an ordered mechanism in which the delivery of a proton and an electron to the catalytic type 2 Cu site is highly orchestrated. Electron transfer from a redox partner protein, azurin or pseudoazurin, to the type 1 Cu site is assumed to occur through the formation of a protein­protein complex. We report here a new crystal form in space group P212121 of the Met144Leu mutant of NiR from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (AxNiR), revealing a head-to-head packing motif involving residues around the hydrophobic patch of domain 1. Superposition of the structure of azurin II with that of domain 1 of one of the Met144Leu molecules provides the first glimpse of an azurin II­NiR protein­protein complex. Mutations of two of the residues of AxNiR, Trp138His (Barrett et al. in Biochemistry 43:16311­16319, 2004) and Met87Leu, highlighted in the AxNiR­azurin complex, results in substantially decreased activity when azurin is used as the electron donor instead of methyl viologen, providing direct evidence for the importance of this region for complex formation.

Introduction Copper-containing dissimilatory nitrite reductases (NiRs) play a key role in the nitrogen cycle by carrying out the first committed step in denitrification, the one-electron reduction of NO2­ to NO [1­3]. High-resolution crystallographic structures together with biochemical data for several NiRs and their mutants have provided a detailed insight into the global mechanism of nitrite reduction [3­ 9]. In particular, it has been demonstrated that an ordered mechanism [5] is operational where nitrite binds to the catalytic type 2 Cu (T2Cu) centre in the Cu(II) state, displacing bound water. An electron is initially transferred to the type 1 Cu (T1Cu) site from a redox partner protein. Subsequent internal electron transfer from T1Cu to T2Cu occurs through the Cys130 fi His129 [4, 10] bridge,1 which links the two metal centres in a ``hard-wired'' manner and is controlled through a substrate sensor/signalling loop (His94­Asp92­His89) so that the premature reduction of the T2Cu and thus its inactivation is avoided [11, 12]. On the basis of crystal structures and biochemical data for NiR from several organisms, a ``hydrophobic patch'' on the surface of NiR and near to the T1Cu has been proposed as the binding site for the redox partner protein [6, 13­15]. There has been some discussion as to the nature of the periplasmic electron donor to NiRs in different organisms

but it is apparent that azurin, pseudoazurin and cytochrome c551 have putative roles. A. xylosoxidans is an organism that unusually expresses two distinct azurins with very similar physicochemical properties [16]. Both are equally effective in electron donation to AxNiR in vitro. Despite much effort by several groups, a crystal structure of the protein­protein complex between a CuNiR and its redox partner(s) has not been determined.2 This difficulty is probably a reflection of the low free energy for complex formation and short lifetime that is conducive to rapid electron transfer in such complexes. It is likely that complex formation between azurin and AxNiR proceeds via one or more transient ``encounter complexes''. Nonspecific collisions guided primarily by electrostatic interactions would lead to a range of different such encounter complexes prior to the formation of the productive electron transfer complex. Such transient complexes have been characterised by NMR in the case of the formation of the bacterial phosphotransferase complex [18, 19]. In the case of AxNiR, mutation of residue Trp138, located near to the hydrophobic patch, to histidine decreased the catalytic activity substantially when azurin was used as the electron donor; however, the mutation had no effect when an artificial electron donor was used, suggesting that Trp138 is part of the intermolecular electron transfer pathway between the T1Cu sites of azurin and NiR when

the complex is formed [20]. For several cupredoxins, including azurins from A. xylosoxidans [21] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [22], and rusticyanin from Thiobacillus ferrooxidans [23], crystal structures have revealed a ``head-to-head'' packing motif where the T1Cu sites of two adjacent molecules are in close proximity (Fig. 1). This head-to-head encounter has been suggested to be of relevance to the electron self-exchange reaction in cupredoxins. For AxNiR and its redox partner azurin, a computational docking model based on surface complementarity and electrostatics has been proposed which is consistent with this type of head-to-head interaction and which ° positions the T1Cu centres of the two proteins some 13 A apart and where the hydrophobic patch of AxNiR is involved in the complex formation [6]. Structure­function studies of amino acid substitutions in T1Cu ligands and other mechanistically important residues in AxNiR have indicated [4, 5, 20] that direct transfer of electrons from the redox partner protein (azurin) to the catalytic T2Cu centre does not occur and that the ratedetermining step of catalysis is most probably the intermolecular electron transfer from azurin to the T1Cu centre of NiR. However, in the case of NiR from A. faecalis, it has recently been suggested that the rate-limiting step is the electron transfer from the T1Cu to the T2Cu centre [24]. In this study, we crystallised the Met144Leu mutant3 of AxNiR in a crystal form where two copies of domain 1

pack head-to-head in a similar manner to that observed for several cupredoxins. We are persuaded that this region is important in complex formation between AxNiR and its redox partner, azurin. Superposition of the azurin II structure (PDB 2ccw [25]) onto domain 1 of Met144Leu NiR was used to generate the NiR­redox partner complex, which reveals that the electron-donating Cu centre of azurin is in an appropriate orientation for electron transfer to the T1Cu centre of AxNiR to occur.

Materials and methods The Met144Leu mutant of AxNiR was expressed and purified as described previously [4]. Briefly, the periplasmic fraction was obtained from a chemical lysis of the cells, followed by centrifugation. After centrifugation, proteins were precipitated by the addition of 65% (w/v) ammonium sulphate. The precipitate was resuspended in, and dialysed against, 20 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulphonic acid (MES) pH 6.0 containing 1 mM CuSO4, followed by three further dialysis steps against 20 mM MES pH 6.0 before purification was initiated. Mutant NiR was purified using a CM-cellulose column equilibrated first with 20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)­HCl pH 8.5 then with 2 vol water. The column was washed with 20 mM Tris­HCl pH 6.5 to remove any unbound proteins and NiR was collected by elution with 75 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris­HCl pH 6.0. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used routinely to assess the purity of the protein samples. For pure preparations of NiR the protein concentration was estimated using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 1.54 M­1 cm­1. X-ray data collection and data reduction Crystals of Met144Leu AxNiR were grown using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Two microliters of protein solution at a concentration of 8 mg ml­1 in 50 mM MES pH 6.0 was suspended over a reservoir solution consisting of 1.7 M ammonium sulphate and 0.1 M citric acid, pH 4.2. Single crystals of an intense blue colour grew within 1 week. A crystal was soaked for approximately 2 min in cryoprotectant solution consisting of 20% ethylene glycol in mother liquor and flash frozen to 100 K in a nitrogen cryostream. Data were collected from a single crystal on station 14.1 at the SRS, Daresbury Laboratory, ° using an ADSC-Quantum4 detector to a resolution of 2.4 A ° at a wavelength of 1.488 A. The data were scaled and merged with HKL2000 [26]. The protein was found to be ° in a large unit cell with dimensions of a = 171.96 A, ° , c = 181.06 A in space group P212121. The ° b = 175.91 A data processing statistics are summarised in Table 1.

Values in parentheses are for the outer resolution shell

Structure solution and refinement The structure was solved by molecular replacement in Molrep [27] using a symmetry-generated trimer from the ° 1.9-A resolution structure of the Met144Leu mutant in space group H3 [4] (PDB 2bp0) as the search model. The solution indicated that two trimers were present in the asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 79.8%. The structure was refined by maximum likelihood methods using REFMAC5 [28] within the CCP4 program suite [29]. Rebuilding of the model between refinement cycles was done using O [30]. A total of 1,291 solvent molecules were added to the model using ARP/WARP [31] and by manual methods. The model was subjected to translation/libration/ screw refinement implemented in REFMAC 5, resulting in a final R factor of 17.0% (Rfree = 19.1%). The final model consisted of 15,398 protein atoms, 1,281 water molecules and 12 Cu atoms. The model was assessed using PROCHECK [32]. The Ramachandran plot [33] shows 90.8% of the residues to be

in the ``most favoured'' region and 9.2% in the ``additionally allowed'' region. The estimated standard uncertainty [34], based on the R factor, as calculated in ° REFMAC5 was 0.093 A and the root mean square (RMS) deviations from ideal bond lengths and angles were ° 0.009 A and 1.2°, respectively. A summary of the quality indicators for the structure is given in Table 1.

posing trimers A and B gave an RMS deviation of 0.38 for the main-chain Ca atoms. Head-to-head packing of AxNiR trimers The Met144Leu structure presented here is to lower resolution than our previously published structure in space group H3; hence, the copper site parameters, which are similar to those described previously, are not discussed here. The Met144Leu structure contains two AxNiR trimers in the asymmetric unit (in a P212121 space group) in contrast to the previous Met144Leu structure [4] where only two monomers were present. Moreover, this is the first crystal structure, amongst several reported, of any copper NiR that has been crystallised with two complete trimers in the asymmetric unit. These are found to be orientated in a head-to-head fashion with domain 1 (as defined by Dodd et al. [11]) of one of the monomers from each trimer named as the ``head'' of the trimeric molecule. The two Cu atoms of the T1Cu sites of subunit E and subunit F for trimers A ° and B, respectively, were 19.5 A apart (Fig. 2a). The two ° His139 ligands of the T1Cu sites are separated by 17 A. The head-to-head binding motif has been reported previously for cupredoxins, the proposed group of proteins that may act as electron donors to Cu NiRs; however, this is the first evidence of this packing arrangement for NiR. The crystal structure of azurin II [21] revealed that the two

Results General description of the structure Met144Leu AxNiR crystallises in space group P212121 with two trimers in the asymmetric unit. As a consequence of the high solvent content (approximately 80%), the structure is partially disordered with an overall mean ° temperature factor value of 47.7 A2. Despite the high B factor, with the exception of the N- and C-termini and some short loop regions on the protein surface, the 2Fo­Fc electron density map, contoured at 1r, was continuous over the main chain of both trimers. Superposition of each tri° mer with the 1.9-A structure of Met144Leu AxNiR in space ° group H3 [4] resulted in an RMS deviation of 0.31 A for ° for trimer B. Given the modest restrimer A and 0.34 A ° olution (2.4 A) of the present structure, these differences are considered to be nonsignificant. Similarly, superim-

symmetry-related azurin molecules packed together in a head-to-head fashion, positioning the copper ions some ° 14.7 A apart. The solvent-exposed histidine residues ° His117 from each molecule were 6.7 A apart. Similarly, the Met148Gln mutant of rusticyanin from T. ferrooxidans [23] again showed two molecules packed head-to-head, ° with the Cu ions in this case being separated by 15 A, and the equivalent histidine residues His143 being linked by a series of ordered water molecules. These data have provided support for the concept that an electron transfer complex between cupredoxins and NiRs would proceed via a similar head-to-head interaction. The intermolecular contacts between Met144Leu AxNiR trimers involve only one monomer from each trimer--namely monomer E for trimer 1 and monomer F for trimer 2. Most interacting residues belong to domain 1 and are found to be involved in hydrophobic interactions, most of which are common to both trimers (Fig. 2b). A number of solvent molecules participate in the interaction between the two NiR molecules. Residues Ala83 to Pro88 form a contact region in both trimers and provide the largest binding surface, but the interaction with neighbouring residues differs between the two trimers. Asn85O of chain E (trimer A) is hydrogen-bonded to Ala194N of monomer F (trimer B) via Wat13, whereas the nearest atom (again O) of the same residue in trimer B (monomer F) is in contact with Met87 Ce of trimer A (monomer E). The second region of domain 1 that forms part of the interface includes residues 110­112. Residues Ala194 and Tyr197 of domain 2 from trimer A and residues Thr192, Ala194 and Glu195 from trimer B form contacts in the interaction area mainly through van der Waals interactions. The accessible protein ° surface buried in the trimer­trimer interface is 2,991.5 A2 per trimer, as calculated using the program GRASP [35]. A full list of interatomic distances in the interface region is given in Table 2. Azurin­AxNiR complex and the effect of mutations in AxNiR on activity Met144Leu AxNiR has been crystallised in the P212121 space group with a solvent content of nearly 80%. The ° T1Cu atoms in the two trimers are some 19.7 A apart, similar to that observed in azurin­azurin head-to-head complexes [21, 22, 36]. Each monomer of AxNiR consists of two domains, each of which adopts a fold similar to that of the cupredoxin family, of which azurin is a member. A ° superposition of the 1.13-A structure of azurin II (PDB 2ccw) [25] with domain 1 of Met144Leu NiR gave an ° RMS deviation of 1.82 A (Fig. 3a). The T1Cu atoms adopted near-identical positions. Given the close structural homology between AxNiR domain 1 and azurin, we are persuaded that this superposition provides a good ``in

silico'' model for the protein­protein complex between AxNiR and azurin. However, we note that this may represent either an initial ``encounter complex'' as described for the bacterial phosphotransferase system [18], or an intermediate between such an encounter complex and the productive, electron-donating form of the complex. In addition, the presence of domain 2 of the second trimer of AxNiR in the Met144Leu crystal structure may prevent domain 1 from adopting the precise orientation which would be adopted by azurin II in a solution protein­protein complex. In this model for an AxNiR­azurin complex, close contacts are formed between residues Lys38, Met39 and Ala40 of azurin, and residues Ala86, Met87 and Pro88 and Met135 of NiR. In addition, the side chain of Lys38 of azurin is within interaction distance of Met87, Trp138 and Ala194 of NiR (Fig. 3b). These residues are in close proximity to His139, the solvent-exposed ligand of T1Cu in NiR and which is considered to be the primary link for the electron transfer from the redox partner. These residues are part of the ``hydrophobic patch'' of residues on the protein surface. We have mutated Met87 to leucine.4 This mutation results in a reduction in activity (85% activity) when the physiological donor azurin is used as the electron donor, consistent with a role for Met87 in complex formation and/or intermolecular electron transfer. The mutant is shown to retain more than 95% activity when the artificial electron donor methyl viologen (where complex formation with azurin is not a factor) is used as the electron donor. In addition, we have previously mutated Trp138, which had implied its involvement in the electron transfer
4

pathway between azurin and NiR. The Trp138His mutant has only 10% of the activity of native AxNiR with azurin as the electron donor [20]. These functional studies on the aforementioned mutants provide strong support for the validity of the model for an encounter complex. Finally, there is an interaction region between residues 40­43 (azurin) with Asn109 and Glu112 (NiR). We note that several additional interactions occur between residues in two copies of domain 2 in Met144Leu AxNiR and these would not participate in this mode of binding between azurin and NiR. The accessible protein surface buried in this encounter ° complex, calculated using GRASP, is 1,337.5 A2 (Fig. 3c). This is a significantly smaller area than that in the Met144Leu trimer­trimer interface, in part because interactions of domain II are not present in this case. This model may be compared with the results of a rigid-body docking study [6] between AxNiR and azurin (henceforth referred to as the docking model). In that case, although a head-tohead interaction was predicted, the orientation of the azurin molecule was different such that the Cu positions in the docked azurin molecule and the azurin molecule superimposed onto domain 1 of Met144Leu NiR were approx° imately 15 A different. In the docking model, residues involved in the docking interface from the azurin molecule were Val42, Leu68, Tyr72 and Met64 and from NiR the residues involved were Met87, Met135, Ala194 and Tyr197. The docking model did not predict the involvement of Trp138 in the azurin­NiR interface. This difference between the two positions of azurin may be a limitation of the rigid-body docking process, or may represent different stages of the encounter, recognition and electron transfer conformations adopted during the complex-formation process. A comparison of the two azurin positions is given in Fig. 3d.

Conclusion The head-to-head packing observed between trimers of AxNiR in the Met144Leu crystal structure provides evidence that NiR can self-associate through this surface contact region. Similar interactions have also been previously observed in several structures of cupredoxins, including azurin and rusticyanin. In these structures the cupredoxin fold is organised so as to place the T1Cu sites close together, providing a structural model for the transient complex that leads to the electron self-exchange exhibited by azurin in solution [36]. These findings of the juxtapositioning of AxNiR domain 1 in the crystal provides strong support for the hypothesis that NiR and its redox partner form a complex in which the T1Cu sites from each ° protein are positioned approximately 20 A apart, with the

The Met87Leu mutant was produced using a similar protocol to that used for the Met144Leu mutant [4]. NiR activity was determined using two independent methods using methyl viologen/dithionite ion mixed assay or azurin as a reductant as described in [6, 37].

Mutation of two of these residues (Trp138His, Met87Leu) has already been carried out, resulting in decreased activity when azurin is used as the electron donor instead of methyl viologen, thus providing strong support for the validity of the model.
