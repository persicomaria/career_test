Membrane fusion in cells involves the interaction of SNARE proteins on apposing membranes. Formation of SNARE complexes is preceded by tethering events, and a number of protein complexes that are thought to mediate this have been identified. The VFT or GARP complex is required for endosome-Golgi traffic in yeast. It consists of four subunits, one of which, Vps51, has been shown to bind specifically to the SNARE Tlg1, which participates in the same fusion event. We have determined the structure of the N-terminal domain of Tlg1 bound to a peptide from the N terminus of Vps51. Binding depends mainly on residues 18­30 of Vps51. These form a short helix which lies in a conserved groove in the three-helix bundle formed by Tlg1. Surprisingly, although both Vps51 and Tlg1 are required for transport to the late Golgi from endosomes, removal of the Tlg1-binding sequences from Vps51 does not block such traffic in vivo. Thus, this particular interaction cannot be crucial to the process of vesicle docking or fusion.

GTPases ­ rho GTPases in the case of the exocyst (3), Ypt1 with COG (4), Ypt6 and Arl1 with VFT (5,6) and Ypt7 with HOPS (7). Ultimately, however, they must operate in conjunction with SNAREs. Whether their function is simply to hold membranes in close apposition, so that SNAREs can engage, or to actively catalyse the SNARE assembly reaction, is not known. Some interactions with SNAREs have been reported. The HOPS complex includes the Sec1 homologue Vps33, which interacts with the SNARE Vam3 (7­9). The COG complex has been reported to interact with Sed5 and other Golgi SNAREs, although these interactions have not been characterized in detail (4). In this article, we examine the interaction between the VFT complex and the SNARE Tlg1. VFT contains four subunits and, unlike the octameric COG and exocyst complexes, is dispensable for growth. It is, however, required for the efficient recycling of membrane proteins from endosomes to the Golgi (5,10). The individual VFT subunits, Vps51, 52, 53 and 54, appear to be held together by a bundle of coiled coils (11). The complex is recruited to Golgi membranes by the GTP form of Ypt6, which binds to Vps52 (5,11). The fusion step, which it promotes, requires the four SNAREs Tlg1, Tlg2, Vti1 and Snc1 (or the almost identical Snc2), which form a single complex (12,13). Cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that Tlg1 and perhaps indirectly Tlg2 are associated with VFT even when its recruitment to the Golgi is blocked by mutation of Ypt6 (5,14). This interaction has been traced to the smallest subunit, Vps51 (11,15). Interaction between Tlg1 and Vps51 can be observed in vivo even when functional VFT/GARP complex is absent because of deletion of the VPS52 gene (15). Vps51 has 164 residues, of which residues 1­30 and 103­142 are well conserved between yeast species. The second conserved region comprises a coiled-coil domain and is required for association with the VFT complex; the first 30 residues bind to the N-terminal domain of Tlg1 (11). The VFT­Tlg1 interaction could have several functions. It could link Tlg1 on an incoming vesicle to VFT on the Golgi, thus mediating the tethering event. However, because Tlg1 cycles between Golgi and endosomes and will be present on both the fusing membranes, it is not obvious how such trans interactions would be favoured over cis ones. Alternatively, it has been suggested that Tlg1 might, like the plasma membrane SNAREs syntaxin 1 and Sso1, be auto-inhibited by interaction of its N-terminal domain with the C-terminal SNARE motif and that, by binding to the N-terminal domain, Vps51 could prevent this interaction and thus activate Tlg1 for fusion (11,15). A third

Specific fusion of transport vesicles with their targets requires the combined actions of SNAREs, which mediate the fusion event and accessory factors that help vesicles adhere to the target membrane and which may also aid the formation of SNARE complexes. So-called tethering factors include two distinct classes of protein, those with elongated coiled-coil structures and large multisubunit complexes (1,2). Examples of the latter are the HOPS/Class C Vps complex on yeast vacuoles, the TRAPP complexes on the early Golgi and the COG, VFT (also known as GARP) and exocyst complexes which may share a distant structural relationship with each other and act at the early Golgi, late Golgi and plasma membrane, respectively (1). Large tethering complexes are typically recruited by, or at least interact with, small membrane-associated

possibility is that the association of VFT and Tlg1 serves simply to keep them co-located, thus aiding their co-operation in the docking and fusion events. Here, we present the structure of the N-terminal domain of Tlg1 bound to a peptide from Vps51. The peptide forms a partial helix that lies along a groove in the three-helix bundle formed by Tlg1. Binding is dependent on interactions between a hydrophobic cluster of amino acids in Vps51 and a pocket in the SNARE. However, deletions or point mutations that eliminate binding do not prevent recycling from endosomes to the Golgi in vivo. As with some other interactions with SNAREs, it seems that the association of VFT with Tlg1 may help to keep the proteins together but does not make a critical contribution to membrane docking or fusion.

GST-Vps51, but not of GST alone, could readily be detected. The complex appeared surprisingly stable, dissociating only very slowly under these conditions, which prevented estimation of an affinity constant. This stability may, however, be a consequence of the dimeric nature of GST ­ bivalent interactions with immobilized proteins can result in very low off-rates. Such tight binding was not observed with a monomeric Vps51-maltose-binding protein chimera (unpublished observations). The specificity of the binding was confirmed by point mutations. Previous deletion analysis showed that removal of residues 27­30 of Vps51 prevented binding to Tlg1 (11). Using the BIAcore technique, we found that single substitutions of Phe27 to Leu or Tyr28 to Ala were sufficient to abolish binding completely (note the different concentrations of proteins used in Figure 1B). Because it had been suggested that the N- and C-terminal domains of Tlg1 might associate, we also tested a GST fusion containing the C-terminal SNARE motif of Tlg1, but no binding was detected even at high concentration (Figure 1C). The specific nature of the Vps51­Tlg1 interaction encouraged us to attempt structure determination. An untagged version of the Tlg1 N-terminal domain (residues 1­101) was expressed and crystallized in combination with a synthetic peptide comprising residues 2­30 of Vps51, and the structure determined using selenomethionine substitution of Met62 for phasing. This first structure showed the

Results
Previous work has shown that the first 30 residues of Vps51 can bind to Tlg1 in yeast extracts (11,15). To verify that this interaction is direct and requires only the N-terminal domain of Tlg1, we expressed residues 1­103 of Tlg1, followed by a single cysteine and a His tag in Escherichia coli. Binding of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Vps51(1­30) was then measured by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore), the Tlg1 fragment being immobilized via its cysteine residue. Figure 1A shows that binding of

peptide in a partially alpha helical configuration, binding to a groove in the three-helix bundle formed by Tlg1. However, the Phe27 residue of Vps51 that is critical for binding in solution made contacts not with the Tlg1 molecule with which the peptide was closely associated, but with the C-terminal part of an adjacent Tlg1 domain. This suggested that some distortion of the complex had occurred during crystal formation. To avoid this, we prepared a new Tlg1 construct comprising residues 1­95, lacking the residue contacted by Phe27. In addition, because the N-terminal region of the Vps51 peptide was disordered in the first structure, we used a different peptide comprising residues 9­32 of Vps51. These changes resulted in crystals very similar to the initial ones, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement. In this structure, Phe27 of Vps51 forms hydrophobic interactions with the Tlg1 molecule to which the rest of the peptide is bound. Figure 2 shows an overview of the final structure. The Tlg1 N-terminal domain has a three-helix structure very similar to that of other SNAREs such as syntaxin 6 (the closest mammalian homologue of Tlg1) (16), with a root ° mean square deviation of 2.3 A for 84 of the 95 alpha carbon atoms in the structure. Helices a, b and c comprise residues 7­28, 38­63 and 71­92, respectively. Residues 16­30 of Vps51 form a helix that lies in the groove between the a and the b helices of Tlg1, with residues 9­15 extending along this groove in a non-helical

configuration. The orientation of the two molecules is such that the C terminus of Vps51, to which the rest of the VFT complex is attached, is far from the C terminus of the Tlg1 domain, which is linked to the SNARE motif and membrane anchor. Leu30 forms a hydrophobic interaction, capping the cluster of interactions that include Phe27. Although important for binding, Tyr28 does not directly contact Tlg1; it may be required to position Phe27 or to stabilize the short helix of Vps51. In addition to the complex, we also obtained quite different crystals of the Tlg1(1­95), domain alone. These contained domain-swapped dimers, in which the a and b helices of one molecule were associated with the c helix of another, which is probably an artefact of crystallization. Despite this anomaly, the arrangement of the helices relative to each other was very similar to the structure depicted in Figure 2 (data not shown). Thus, it seems likely that the Tlg1 structure is a stable one that forms independently, to which Vps51 binds without inducing any significant conformational change. To verify that the binding site seen in the crystal corresponds to the interactions in solution, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to measure interaction in vivo between mutated versions of both the Tlg1 domain and the Vps51 N terminus (Figure 3). In Vps51, the mutations F27L, Y28A and L30A completely abolished the two-hybrid

Vps51 is the most critical determinant and specifically the hydrophobic interactions at its C-terminal end. Interestingly, comparison of Vps51 sequences from some related yeasts (Figure 3B) suggests that the pattern of conservation can only partly be accounted for by the interactions with Tlg1. In agreement with the structure, F27 changes only to Y, and Y28 and L30 are conserved, but N29 is more variable, and residues 13­15 are sometimes missing. However, residues 1­9 are strongly conserved, even though they are not required for binding and were not ordered when present in the crystal. This portion of Vps51 is thus likely to have some other function. The particular importance of the C-terminal contacts of the Vps51 peptide was borne out by random mutagenesis of the Tlg1 domain (Figure 3C). Mutations P7A and V11A, which alter part of the hydrophobic binding site for the Vps51 helix, abolished binding. From a screen for mutants that affected Vps51 binding, we also isolated F8L and L55S, but these form parts of the hydrophobic core of the Tlg1 helical bundle and thus may affect its folding or conformation. In contrast, mutations affecting other possible contacts had little effect ­D14A, Q18A, R57A and V61A. Again, this may be because individual changes can be accommodated while retaining much of the contact area. However, mutation of D54 abolished binding. This residue lies between R57 of Tlg1 and R20 of Vps51; neither of these is required for binding, but D54 may help to prevent their mutual repulsion. An independent way to assess the importance of the Vps51-binding site in Tlg1 is to examine the evolutionary conservation of the binding surface. Figure 4 shows three views of the structure, facing each of the three possible grooves between helices, coloured to indicate the degree of conservation of each Tlg1 residue among 14 ascomycete fungi. Although not all of these have identifiable Vps51 proteins, there is nevertheless a strikingly higher conservation of the contact region compared with other parts of the surface, suggesting that binding to this groove is indeed a conserved feature at least among these fungi. By contrast, although mammals do contain homologues of the other VFT subunits, Vps52, 53 and 54, no Vps51 equivalent has yet been identified, and the structure of the Tlg1 relative, syntaxin 6, shows a rather narrow groove between the a and b helices. The syntaxin 6 sequence is very similar in different vertebrates, making it hard to ascertain any preferential conservation within these species. However, mapping the conservation of residues across a wide range of non-fungal species onto the structure of syntaxin 6 did not reveal a preferentially conserved face (Figure 4). This suggests either that a Vps51­Tlg1 interaction is not a universal phenomenon or that the proteins have coevolved, so that the interaction interface is not itself conserved. Nevertheless, it is striking that some of the contact residues we have identified in Tlg1 are also present in syntaxin 6 (P7, F8, V11, D54, L55). 185

Surprisingly, L23A, R20A, D19A and R12A, all of which affect residues that interact with Tlg1 in the crystal, did not affect the two-hybrid signal indicating that these interactions are not critical. This may be because the interacting surface is relatively large, the buried surface ° ° comprising 860A2 on Tlg1 and 1000A2 on Vps51, and the Vps51 peptide quite flexible, allowing individual mutations to be accommodated without loss of other interactions. In agreement with this, deletion of the first 11 or 17 residues of Vps51 allowed weak growth, but deletion to position 19 or further did not.

Three views of the structure are shown, each as ribbon diagrams and as surfaces rendered according to the degree of conservation, with darker colour indicating greater conservation. For Tlg1, conservation is estimated by degree of sequence identity between 14 fungal species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae, Saccharomyces bayanus, Saccharomyces kudriavzevii, Saccharomyces castellii and Saccharomyces kluyveri, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, Debramyces hansenii, Yarrowia lipolytica, Eremothecium gossypii, Kluyveromyces lactis and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. For Syntaxin 6, the comparisons are between a wide range of non-fungal species: Rattus norvegicus, Xenopus laevis, Danio rerio, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Drosophila melanogaster, Anopheles gambiae, Apis mellifera, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Dictyostelium discoideum.

Role of the Vps51­Tlg1 interaction in vivo Having established that there is a specific and direct interaction between Vps51 and Tlg1 in vitro, we next sought to determine whether this interaction is needed for membrane traffic in vivo. Genetic studies have shown that the VFT complex is required for recycling of proteins from endosomes to the Golgi in yeast. Deletion of Vps52, 53 or 54 blocks this process and also makes cells temperature sensitive for growth (5,10). Deletion of Vps51 has a similar but somewhat weaker phenotype (11,15). Without Vps51, the other subunits can still assemble and bind to Golgi membranes, although the amount of the complex appears lower (11). To address specifically the role of the Vps51­Tlg1 interaction, we complemented vps51 null mutant cells with versions of Vps51 containing point mutations that abolish binding. These cells were then transformed with a plasmid expressing a GFP-tagged variant of the plasma membrane SNARE Sso1 to which an NPFxD endocytosis signal had been added. Previously, we have shown that this construct is endocytosed and rapidly recycled via the Golgi to the cell surface, giving it a steady-state location at the plasma membrane (17). In a Vps51 mutant, however, recycling to the Golgi is inhibited and the NPF-Sso1 186

instead accumulates (Figure 5A).

As shown in Figure 5A, mutation of F27 or Y28 did not affect Vps51 activity as assayed in this way. Even more strikingly, we found that complete deletion of the first 50 residues, including the entire binding region of Vps51, did not abolish function (Figure 5A). Similar results were obtained when recycling of the SNARE Snc1, which follows the same path as NPF-Sso1, was examined (data not shown). Another phenotype of vps51 null mutants is that their vacuoles are fragmented, but the small amounts of NPF-Sso1 that reached the vacuolar membrane showed that vacuoles were restored to normal size by the mutant versions of Vps51, as shown also in Figure 5B when the dye FM4-64 was used to stain vacuoles. Thus, despite the specific and readily detectable binding of Vps51 to Tlg1, this particular interaction does not seem to be needed for function. Because detectable interaction between the VFT/GARP complex and the Tlg1 is completely dependent on Vps51 (15), our results imply that either no such interaction is required for function or there is a cryptic binding site elsewhere in the Vps51 protein. To rule out the latter Traffic 2006; 7: 182­190

in vivo two-hybrid data (Figure 3A). Hence, the N-terminalbinding site on Vps51 is dispensable for function, and there does not appear to be any other strong interaction between the VFT complex and Tlg1. We conclude that the phenotype of vps51 null cells is not due to loss of a VFT­Tlg1 interaction, but more likely reflects a decreased abundance and/or stability of the VFT complex, because of the absence of the Vps51 C-terminal coiled coil that interacts with the other subunits of the complex.

Discussion
We have shown that Tlg1, like several other SNAREs (16), has an N-terminal domain that forms a three-helix bundle. Vps51 binds to this domain via a short peptide sequence, which forms a helix and interacts with a hydrophobic groove on the surface of the SNARE. Binding is highly specific. Indeed yeast Syn8, which is predicted to have a similar Nterminal domain and which can substitute for at least some of the functions of Tlg1 (18), does not bind Vps51 under comparable conditions (our unpublished observations). Although superficially analogous to the intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal domains of plasma membrane SNAREs Sso1 and syntaxin 1 with their C-terminal SNARE motifs (19,20), the Vps51 interaction site differs in its location, being between helices a and b, whereas the SNARE motifs bind between helices b and c. The SNARE motif is also much longer than the Vps51 helix. Furthermore, we could find no evidence for binding between the N- and the C-terminal domains of Tlg1 using the BIAcore assay, and we have also failed to see interaction using a yeast twohybrid assay (unpublished observations). Similar negative results have been reported for the mammalian homologue of Tlg1, syntaxin 6 (16). Thus, although we cannot rule out the possibility that one role of Vps51 is to compete for a binding site normally occupied by the SNARE motif of Tlg1, there is at present no evidence to support this. In fact, our most striking observation is that Vps51 mutations that completely eliminate the interaction with Tlg1 that we have characterized do not affect the ability of a protein to recycle from endosomes to the Golgi, a function that normally does require both Vps51 and Tlg1. It follows that recognition of Tlg1 by the N terminus of Vps51 is not the prime function of the VFT complex nor the primary mechanism of vesicle docking. It seems curious that such a prominent binding interaction is dispensable, but there are precedents for this. The SM protein Sly1 binds tightly to a peptide sequence at the N terminus of the early Golgi SNARE Sed5, yet mutations that prevent this do not affect endoplasmic recticulumGolgi transport or even the localization of Sly1 to Golgi membranes; it seems that the important function of Sly1 may involve other, weaker interactions with SNAREs (21). Similarly, the vacuolar SNARE Vam3 binds to the HOPS 187

This we have found to be a much more sensitive and robust assay than cross-linking in intact cells. As shown in Figure 5C, binding of Tlg1 to full-length Vps51 was readily detected. In contrast, no binding to Tlg1 could be detected with the deletion mutant, in agreement with the Traffic 2006; 7: 182­190

complex via Vps33, an SM protein that forms part of the complex. Deletion of the entire N-terminal domain of Vam3 prevents this interaction yet does not affect vacuole fusion in vivo (22,23). In vitro there is a reduction in the efficiency of fusion, suggesting that the interaction does help in the assembly or action of the fusion machinery, perhaps simply by keeping key components together (22). It may be that the Vps51­Tlg1 interaction similarly contributes to the efficiency of SNARE complex assembly and vesicle fusion by ensuring co-location of these components, or by aiding docking, but that its contribution is sufficiently minor that no phenotype is discernable under the in vivo conditions that we have tested. We cannot rule out the possibility that other weaker interactions between the tethering and SNARE complexes make the particular binding sites that we have investigated redundant or that there are growth conditions in which recruitment of Tlg1 by the tethering complex is more important. A role that requires only that the VFT complex is linked to the SNARE complex, together with the rather minimal sequence requirements for Tlg1 binding, can account for the considerable evolutionary divergence of Vps51. It is currently unclear whether a direct homologue of Vps51 exists outside the fungi or whether syntaxin 6 has a binding site for such a protein. It has very recently been reported that syntaxin 6 does not bind to a human form of the VFT/ GARP complex (24). However, specific binding was detected between human Vps52 and a closely related SNARE, syntaxin 10. The significance and generality of this interaction is not yet clear, especially because syntaxin 10 is only found in a subset of mammals. Moreover, the syntaxin 10 used was a short form found in cDNA libraries which has an internal deletion that removes helix c of the Nterminal domain, and binding was to overexpressed Vps52 rather than to the VFT/GARP complex as a whole (24). Nevertheless, if the association is physiological, it would suggest that a new SNARE­VFT interaction has evolved in humans to take the place of the Tlg1-Vps51 binding. Our results document, for the first time at the atomic level, the interaction of a tethering complex with the SNARE machinery. However, it is still far from clear how the VFT complex contributes to vesicle fusion. So far, only two interactions of the complex are known: that of Vps52 with Ypt6, which recruits it to Golgi membranes, and the dispensable one between Vps51 and Tlg1. Because the VFT complex itself is very important for endosome Golgi transport, there must be other, perhaps weaker, interactions that contribute crucially to function yet remain to be discovered.

After overnight induction with IPTG at 28  C, cells were harvested and frozen. After thawing, they were lysed using an EmulsiFlex C-5 homogenizer (Avestin Inc., Ottowa, Canada), and a cleared supernatant chromatographed on DE52 ion exchange resin in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 2 mM dithiothreitol, eluting with a gradient of 0­400 mM NaCl. Further purification was on Superdex 200 in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol. The protein was then concentrated to 8 mg/mL.

Structure determination
The structure was initially solved from crystals of SeMet Tlg1(1­101) grown in 66% saturated ammonium sulphate, 100 mM sodium citrate pH 5.5 with a threefold molar excess of the peptide AEQISHKKSLRVSSLNKD RRLLLREFYNL (Vps51 2­30) and frozen in 20% glycerol. These crystals ° ° belong to space group P3221 with unit cell a ¼ b ¼ 65.4 A, c ¼ 62.5 A. Three-wavelength MAD datasets were collected from two crystals, at Daresbury Synchroton Radiation Source and at the European Synchroton Radiation Facility (Table 1). All datasets were integrated with Mosflm (25), scaled with Scala (26) and processed with CCP4 programmes (27). One Se site was located by Patterson methods. Phasing was rather weak from both crystals. Phases were calculated separately for each crystal with Sharp (28), and the combined phases were improved by solvent flattening (50.8% solvent) with Solomon (29). The model was partly built using Arp/wArp (30), completed with O (31) and refined with Refmac (32) and Coot (33) against data merged from all three wavelengths from the ESRF dataset (Table 2). The model contained one sulphate ion in addition to the protein. Crystals of SeMet Tlg1(1­95) on its own were grown from 8% PEG8000, 80 mM K phosphate, frozen in 22.5% glycerol. They belong to space group ° ° ° P212121, unit cell a ¼ 44.7 A, b ¼ 46.1 A, c ¼ 117.9 A. Data were col° lected to 2.1 A resolution on a rotating anode (Table 3). The crystals contained a domain-swapped dimer in the asymmetric unit. The loop between helices b and c is straightened out to a continuous helix, but helix c forms identical contacts with helices a and b as in the other structures; only residues 65­69 have a different structure. Crystals of SeMet Tlg1(1­95) complexed with a threefold molar excess of the peptide KSLRVSSLNKDRRLLLREFYNLEN (Vps51 9­32) were grown in 66% saturated ammonium sulphate, 100 mM sodium citrate pH 6.25 and frozen in 20% glycerol. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (34,35) using the Tlg1 model from the first crystal form (Table 4). The model contained four sulphate ions. This is the definitive structure for discussion of the function. All three structures have been submitted to the Protein Data Base (PDB codes 2c5i, 2c5j and 2c5k respectively).

Binding assays
Surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out on a BIAcore 2000 apparatus (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). The Tlg1 N-terminal domain was coupled via the added cysteine to a CM5 chip using standard protocols. After activation of the carboxymethyl groups to N-hydroxysuccinimide esters with a freshly prepared mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide (50 mM in water) and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (195 mM in water) for 4 min (flow rate 10 mL/min), a reactive disulphide group was introduced with a 20 mL injection of 80 mM 2-(2-pyridinyldithio) ethaneamine hydrochloride in 0.1 M borate buffer pH 8.5. Tlg1N-cys (the ligand; 5 mg/mL in 150 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.8) was injected for 5­10 min (flow rate 10 mL/ min) onto the chip. Remaining activated thiol groups were deactivated by injection of 20 mL 50 mM L-cysteine, 1 M NaCl in 0.1 M formate buffer pH 4.3 for 5 min (flow rate 10 mL/min). A total of 1000 RU of Tlg1N-cys were immobilized by this method. The association and dissociation of Tlg1N-cys with GST-Vps51 peptides was investigated at a flow rate of 20 mL/min using HBS (10 mM HEPES with 0.15 M NaCl, 3.4 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic

Yeast two-hybrid assay and mutant selection
Constructs used in the two-hybrid system were pGADT7Vps51(full)WT and pGBKT7Tlg1N WT. They were transformed into the AH109 strain (MatchMaker 2-Hybrid system, Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). Random mutations were introduced into the Tlg1 construct by errorprone polymerase chain reaction, performed in the presence of excess of the nucleotides dATP and dGTP (36). Clones that did not grow in the absence of histidine and remained white on X-Gal plates were sequenced. The number of mutations in each clone was between two and six. Based on the results, single point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). This approach identified mutations in P7, F8 V11 and L55 prior to structure determination. Further mutations were made based on the structure. Single point mutations and deletions in Vps51 were also studied in this way. Individual mutations are listed in the figures.

Functional assays
Vps51 alleles were cloned into yeast expression vectors based on pRS416 (CEN URA3), with the TPI1 promoter. They were expressed in a vps51 null strain derived from SEY6210 (11) either alone or together with a plasmid (CEN LEU2) expressing NPF-GFP-Sso1 (17). Cells were analysed in early log phase. To label vacuoles, we incubated cells in 40 mM FM4-64 in growth medium for 15 min, then washed and reincubated in medium for a further 30 min. Images of live cells in water were obtained with a Bio-Rad (Hemel Hempsted, UK) Radiance confocal microscope.
