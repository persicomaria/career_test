Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase from Bacillus strarothermophilua is a dimeric molecule of approximately 90,000 M,. The crystal structure originally reported by Irwin et nl. (1976) has been re-interpreted using a new density-modification technique. The reinterpretation is confirmed by the complete amino acid sequence (D. Barker & (:. Winter, personal communication). The structure consists of an amino-terminal T/B domain, a domain containing five t-helices, and a region of 99 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus, which appears to be disordered. The re-interpretation reveals two new ti-helires in the *//3 domain. and some changes in chain connections. The strands of the /I-sheet are in the order A, F, E, B, C, D, with A antiparallel to the others. The arrangement of strands B to F is topologically identical to arrangements found in many other proteins, including the first five strands of the sheet in the NAD-binding domain of the dehgdrogenases. Strands B, C. D form a mononucleotide-binding fold. In the complex with tyrosyl adenylate (Rubin & Blow, 1981), an intermediate in t,he reaction catalysed by the enzyme. the adenine lies near the carboxyl-terminal end of strand F of the /?-sheet, with the ribose between the ends of strands B and E. This is similar to the nicotinamide position in dehydrogenases. The tyrosine moiety occupies a pocket at one side of the sheet, close to strands B and C. This tyrosine orientation is quite different from any part of the coenzyme in dehydrogenases. The ends of strands C and D of the sheet are buried, and binding of a nucleotide to the mononucleotide-binding fold formed by strands B. C. D would require a substantial structural change.

1. Introduction

by Irwin et al. (1976) from diffraction measurements to 2.7 x resolution for tbr parent enzyme and three isomorphous derivatives. The re-interpretation was based on the results of a density-modification procedure. Because of t,he poor phasing power of two of the derivatives, and the relativeI> weak diffraction patt,erns obtained from rather small crystals, the quality of the 2.7 A map was poorer than the nominal resolution implies. The peptide chain was recognized as forming an %//3 domain containing a six-stranded /3 sheet. linked at its carboxyl-terminal end to an n-helical domain containing at least, four `r-helices. This peptide chain was sufficient to account for only two-thirds of the molecular weight of the monomer unit, and t,here were several breaks in the chain. The density for many amino acid side-chains could be observed. but in most cases with insuff%ent detail to allow a positive side-chain identification to be made. A preliminary study of the amino acid sequence was made by Dr G. Koc*h (personal communication. 1975), which contained numerous uncertainties requiring further work. Sequences were published by Winter PI al. (1979) for two lengthy peptides of I 18 and 209 amino acids, referred to below as segment,s 1 and 2. Segment, I is the amino-t)erminal sequence. The interpretation given beloa depended on the recognition of these sequencses in the electron density but, has received final confirmation from the complete amino acid sequence derived from t>he cloned gene (U. Barker and G. Winter. personal communication, 1981). Segment, 2 is now known to begin at residue 172 of the complete sequence.

2. Techniques
(a) First round of dr)LSit!l-)II(X1ifiCI2tiott The elect,ron density map of Irwin et rrl. (1976) was subjected to a tlensit?--modific:atiorl procedure, which is described fully elsewhere (Rhat R: Blow. 1982). In brief. the procedure selected all electron-density above a chosen threshold. which was linked and well-connected to points identified as atomic positions in a starting model. In the first round of densitymodification. the starting model included main-chain atoms only. By t,his technique. not only density representing the polypeptide main-chain, but also the associated side-chain densities were included. even though the chemical identity of the side-chain was not known. Phases were calculated from the electron density array so identified. and these were combined with the results of multiple isomorphous replacement to produce improved phases. These phases were used to compute a modified electron density map. which formed the basis for a second cycle of the same procedure. This cyrlic process converged rapidly to givr modified electron density map I.

In segment, 2 of the sequence given by Winter et rrl. (1!179) there are % short stretcshes ricxh in aromatic and aliphatic hvdrophobic residues (249 to 256 YEFYQFWI and 264 to 271 IRYIKYF). In the modibed electron density map I. a new l-helix c-ould be recognized leading into the helical domain. Its density appeared strong t,owards the centre of the domain. where several aromatic side-chains can be recognized. but weak or absent towards the exterior. This re-interpretation allowed 249 to 256 to be assigned to the new helix (helix 1 of the helical domain) and gave a good fit for the aromatic residues at 264 to 271 on helix 2. Residues 278 to 285 (IAIEQEL) could now be recognized on helix 3. forming a pattern of hydrophobic interactions between the 3 helixes. and a satisfactory sequence alignment rould then be made throughout the helical domain.

t The axes of 2.heliws were computed from C" positions the axes of fi-strands by an analogous method.

The unit formed by parallel strands B, C, D is topologically equivalent to the mononucleotide-binding fold defined by Rossman et al. (1977) (see Rao Br Rossmann, 1973). Each linkage between the strands includes an x-helix that is almost antiparallel to the adjacent strands, and each linkage forms a right-handed turn (Richardson, 1976 ; Sternberg & Thornton, 1976; Nagano, 1977). The angles and distances between the strands and antiparallel helices are given in Table 2. The loops between the strands are, however, all longer than the loops in the dehydrogenases, especially the long loop bet,ween strand C and D, which contains two helices. The right-handed linkage between strands D and E is even longer: it contains 66 residues and four distinct oc-helices. One of the helices is antiparallel to strand D, and in contact with it. These two long loops include all the poorly ordered structure close to the molecular 2-fold axis, mentioned in the previous section. Parts of these long loops are also involved in the tyrosine-binding site. The loop between strands E and F is right-handed, and includes a helix in contact with and roughly antiparallel to strand E. The fifth antiparallel helix and sixt,h parallel p-strand needed to form a complete dinucleotide-binding domain are absent, and the chain enters the helical domain immediately after strand F. (b) Substrate binding Branden (1981) points out that the right-handed connections of the loops linking a sheet will mean that connections are made on opposite sides of the sheet when the strand order is reversed. Thus a cleft is likely to be formed between the ends of adjacent strands, when the strand order changes: in TyrRS this happens between strands B and E. The catalytic intermediate tyrosyl adenylate binds, straddling the carboxyl-terminal end of the sheet, with the ribose at the point where strands B and E separate (Monteilhet & Blow, 1978; Rubin & Blow, 1981). This corresponds exactly with the principles proposed by Brand&r, and shows a partial similarity to the orientation observed for NAD in the dehydrogenases. A more detailed comparison shows the adenine of tyrosyl adenylate in TyrRS to be placed rather similarly to the nicotinamide of NAD in dehydrogenases. The

706

adenine makes contact, with the continuation of the F strand towards the carboxy t'erminus. It lies on the surface of the molecule with its G-amino group pointing into the solvent. The adenine also makes contacts with side-chains of the helix linking strands B and C. It is not near the helix axis, and it seems unlikely that t,here would be an orientation effect from a dipolar interaction as proposed by Ho1 et al. (19T8). The tgrosine part of tyrosyl adenylate occupies a pocket close t,o strands B and c', on the opposite side from t,he helix that links them. The back of this pocket is formed by t,he helix linking strands E and F, and the helix leading into the bottom of strand E. This part of the substrate is oriented quite differently from the adenosine part of NAB in the dehydrogenases. which is much closer to the ends of' the first three parallel strands of t)he sheet. In the X/B domain, the amino acids in /Lsheet appear much more clearly in the electron density, and are apparently better ordered. than those in a-helix. The main interactions stabilizing the dimer are between n-helical regions of the l//3 domains. Helical and disordered region

(c)

domain

The chain leading into the first helix of the helical domain is poorly defined in the electron density map. The remainder of the domain is well ordered, and poses few problems of interpretation up to Glu320. The remaining 99 amino acid residues (I). Barker and G. Winter, personal communicat,ion. 1981) apparently constitute a, domain that has substantial static or dynamic disorder. Systematic study of the electron density maps reveals a large continuous volume of density (1500 A3), which is well above the background level. Its features are not clear enough for any definite interpretat,ion. and it would correspond to only a small part of the remaining sequence. In the same part) of t,he map there are several other regions of electron density that are above the background level. Some of this density can be seen in Figure 2. It appears to extend above the a-helical region, and probably makes contact (in the crystals) with an adjacent molecule. This contact is close to the site occupied by t,yrosyl adenylate when this catalyt,ic intermediate is bound to crystals (Mont,eilhet & Blow, 1978; Rubin dt Blow, 1981).

4. Discussion
One of the formidable puzzles about the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is that they must have existed in some rudimentary form as soon as any system for reliable translation of nucleic acid messages into protein emerged, though it seems inevitable that the most primitive translation system must have lacked accurately synthesized protein. In proposing the adaptor hypothesis, Crick (1958) suggested that a sufficiently reliable system to support evolution would require adaptors to recognize the components of the nucleic acid message, and a set of enzymes to join each of these to a particular amino acid. In all surviving biological systems t'hese are aminoacyl-transfer RNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are large and complex proteins. To learn how they developed is not going to be easy, but something can be learned from the

TYROSYLtKNA

707

conservation of their structure over the different forms of life. In prokaryotes there seems to be only one type of synthetase for each amino acid, though in eukaryotes, mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own special set of synthetases. With a few doubtful exceptions, the subunit organization of a particular aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase appears to be the same in all organisms (see Table 1 of Schimmel, 1979). The work of amino acid sequence comparisons has hardly begun, but the acceleration of amino acid sequence analysis int'roduced by nucleic acid sequencing techniques may allow this to proceed very rapidly. If these molecules do represent some of the earliest protein molecules, what can be inferred from the appearance of something like a nucleotide-binding fold, a structural motif that has been found in many different enzymes1 Ytitsyn suggests that a fold of this kind is one of very few likely ways of forming an a/,3 domain (Ptitsyn et al., 1979). On this view, the fold found in TyrRS is a fairly unsurprising one. and serves to further emphasize the limited possibilities that exist for making satisfactory proteins. Rossmann has pressed the view that these relationships give specific and far reaching evidence about evolutionary history of enzymes (Rossmann et al., 1976). On Rossmann's assumptions, we are looking here at a close relative of some very early structural precursor that has developed again and again into new enzymes throughout the whole history of life. The diversity of quaternary structures shown by the different aminoacyl-tItNA synthetases adds another dimension to the puzzle. It is even more baffling to find virtually no sign of primary structure similarity between two molecules of similar subunit organization, tyrosyl- and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (Winter et al. i 1979). Can this simply reflect the amino acid changes that have occurred throughout biological history, hiding the underlying similarity of structure, which will be revealed by the three-dimensional structure? Putney et al. (1981) determined the primary structure of Escherichia co2i AlaRS, and pointed out a stretch of 17 residues of the E. coli TyrRS sequence which can be aligned to show 11 identities with AlaRS, after four deletions have been assumed in the AlaRS sequence, If the same alignment is made with the B. stearothermophilus TyrRS sequence (Winter et al., 1979), only seven identities remain. The amino acid sequence in question spans the antiparallel strand /3,, of the TyrRS structure, and one of the assumed deletions in AlaRS corresponds t'o Gln8 in the a-helix near the amino terminus. Contrary to the suggestion of Putney et aI. (1981) these residues are remote from the adenylate-binding site in TyrRS. These facts make the proposed homology less likely to be significant. Risler et al. (1981) and Zelwer et al. (1982) present a tertiary structure for a fragment of MetRS that contains five parallel strands of sheet with the same topological relationship as strands B to F of TyrRS. The IX//~domain also contains some extended loops that appear rather similar to those in TyrRS. There is an nhelical domain on the same side of the sheet as in TurRS. MetRS is also an Q dimer. but its subunits are almost double the size of the TyrRS subunits. It appears that the structure described by Risler et al. (1981), like the structure described here, does not account for the complete chain of the protein. TyrRS has no editing function (Fersht et al., 1980). It now seems probable that the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that are composed of a single type of small

708

subunit (Asn, Asp, Cys, Glu, His, Lys, Trp, Tyr and possibly ,4rg and Gin) (ban all perform adequately without an editing function. These enzymes do not have to distinguish an isosteric amino acid, nor a slightly smaller amino acid that does not possess a differing polar function (Fersht, 1979). Met,RS has an editing function (Fersht & Dingwall, 1979). It also differs from TyrRB in containing a zinc atom (Posorske et al.; 1979), which is doubtless involved in recognition of the sulphur atom of the amino acid (Fersht et al., 1980). The fragment of MetRS studied b) Risler ef al. (1981) lacks the carboxyl terminus of t,he intact molecule, and is not dimeric. Hence, in contrast to TyrRS, the dimerization does not depend exclusively on amino acids near the N t,erminus. For these reasons it may be premature to use the preliminary result on MetRS as the basis of a theory based on a structural homology between all the amino acid activating enzymes, though such an idea is very att,ractive. More structures are needed, and the structure of tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase may be especially interesting (Carter & Carter, 1979). In order to transfer the aminoacyl group t,o a tRNA molecule, the amino-acyltRNA synthetases need to bind the 3'-terminal adenosine of a tRNA molecule close to the n-amino group of the aminoacyl moiety. In TyrRS this brings it near to the p-sheet', one end of which (strands A, F and E) is already identified as binding another substrate, ATP. An obvious inference is thab the binding site for the terminal adenosine of tRNA would be near the ends of strands B, C and D, which do form the three-stranded unit that has been termed the mononucleotide-binding fold. This would be a position roughly equivalent to the position of adenosine 01 NAD in the dehydrogenases. There is no free space in the TyrRS structure for the binding of adenosine near the ends of strands B, C and D. The ends of strands C and D are buried. Any binding of tRNA to the mononucleotide-binding fold formed by strands B, (1 and D would require a structural change, which would almost certainly have a strong effect on the dimer association. Our experiments in binding oligonucleotide analogues of the 3' terminus of tRNA to crystalline TyrRS have not indicated an? specific binding to the enzyme (Rubin & Blow, 1981).
