Cstnpetition studies with thiophanol indicate that one cyanide can be displuced by thiolate from one type of site 1IT] and further SXAFS studies indicutethat cyanide may bind io Mo [ IS] . PreviousEXAFSstudies have suggested that molybdenum may not be the binding site for thiophenol and phenylselenol [ 91. The structure of isolated FeMoco of necessity differs from the protein-bound form since the Fe-cysteine and Mo-histidine linkages of FeMoco to the protein must be seveled during the extraction process. One would therefore expect that at least these two sites on free FeMoco could be available for binding, i.e., solvent (N or 0 in the case of NMF) or added thiolateor selenolatecould bind either to Fe or to Mo. In order to uefine better the structural parametersrelating to the intcrac.tionof such ligunds with FeMoco, the binding of a variety of chalcogcno-ligands to the FcMoco from K. pneumorticru lllas been studied by X-ray absorption spect r' oscopy at the Fe, Se, and in case of ligand 1, MOk-edges.

Fe kedge spectra were collected on EXAFS station 8.1, where a slit-less double crystal Si( 111) monochromator and a toroidalmirror were employed in order to maximise the photon intensity on the samples without any degradation of the energy resolution of the monochromatic beam.

In all cases agreement with crystallographically determined distances for shells of I 3 8, was 0.02 8, or better, and coordination number better than f 10%. The EXAFS data were weighted by k3to compensate for the diminishing amplitude at high k. Data were analysed between k=3.0 and k- 15.7 (native,) or k= 14.9 (ligated samples) at the Fe kedge, and between k-2.8 and k= 11 and 14 at the Se and MO k-edges, respectively. Difference spectra were obtained by subtraction of the EXAFS of FeMoco or the simulated model (as specified) from the EXAFS of FeMoco plus ligand.

al. 1281and Liu et al. f 181,we also observe minor interactions in the 4-6 A range at both the Fe and MOk-edges. In view of their small contribution to the data and the inability of EXAFS analysis to deal with a large number of minor components, especially at longer distances, no attemptshave been made to fit them. There has been debate over the existance of a light atom contribution at 1.8-2.0 8( in the Fe k-edge $XAF§ of extractedFeMoco. Arber et al. [ 121point out that the inclusion of 0.5 O/N in this range resulted in a small improvment in the fit, but that on wfinement, the distance obtained was unreasonable.Chen et al, [ "81 include a small contribution at 1.84 A with caveats. The high quality and wide data range used here reveals that the standardfour-shell model of the Fe k-edge visually incompleteon the low-r side of the S shsll. IS Subtractionof an ` only first shell'model from the experiS mental data rt;veals n peak at * 1.9 A twice the intensity of the noise. This is best simulatedas 0.5 O/N at 1.90A, which is in agreement with Fourierfiltering of the first sulfur shell. Addition of 0.5 O/N at 1.90 8, to the standard four-shell model improves the tit by 9%. With this five-shcZmodel, the distance for the new shell is well defined. However, due to the small contribution the shell makes to the data and the correlation between the coordination number and DebyeWailer factor, the amount of O/N present cannot be determined more accurately than 2-3 per cofactor. Clearly, although relatively minor, such a contribution needs to be included in the simulation. A light atom contribution could nrisc from the Q/N-atom of u ligand, such as NMF, which tnrryoccupy the coordinationsite freed on the trrmimzlFe of FeMncs upon its removal from the protein.

pendent of the inclusion of oxygen in the mndel. These observations would be consistent with the displacement of a weak O/N-donor ligtiud from an Fe by pheglthlol. Both of these models are visually incomplete in the Fourier transform as they do not fit the new small shell in the 3-3.3 A region. To ensure that the new small peak in the ligated samples was not an artefact arising from truncation of the Fourier transform, the unligated data were Fourier transformed over the same data range. (The data range for the unligated cofactor was slightly longer than for ligated s: npies.) This showed that the new small peak was not due to differences in the data range compared to the unligated sample. Additionally, Fourier transforms of the ligated data over various data ranges showed the new peak to be consistently present. Normally we would not include such a small peak in the model because of the very small contibution it makes to the EXAFS. However, since the peak is greater than the noise, is absent in the ` native'spectrum and the distance is ideal for the a-carbon of rhe ligand, identification was attempted. Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting both the native data and the theory. These suggest that the peak could arise from carbon, possibly from a non-bonding interaction bridged by a ligand sulfur: i.e. Fe, I+M,rr,,-S-C, ,,,,,. However, when these parameters are added to the full data. the small improvement in the fit is not sufficient to warrant its inclusion. The Fe k-edge XANES with and without 10 equiv. of 2bromaphenylthiol are identical. However, there are minor differences in the EXAFS. The Fourier transform reveals a smell decrease in intensity of the sulfur shell, a larger increase in the intensity of the mixed-mcM (~/MO) shell. ml n small new peak a1 approximetely 3.1 A.

However, all the chmgos CUIIhe dequately modelled using the basic four-shell model Li)runcomplexed RMoco by allowing puramcters lo tlorrl freely. This leads lo QIIobserved increase in the cootdinution number for S (to 3.1) and decrease in the iron coordination numbers (to 2.1 aid 0.5) with corresponding changes in theit Debye-Wallet factors (0.008 snd 0.002 A" compared with 0.014 and 0.003 A"for uncomplexed FeMoco) . Alternatively, a bromine contribution at 2.53 ,&can also be used to model the increased intensity. but its inclusion is nat statistically ,jusUied. AddiGonally. the difference spectrum (minus uncomplexed ) supports the notion that the increased intensity is due solely to Fe, not Bt. The reduction in the Fe coordination numbers and Debye-Wailer factors was uncxpoctcd. Attempts to increase the amount of Fe observed by having a 2-i- I split shell between 2.6-2.7 A were not successful, Inclusion ofO.2-4~.S oxygen at I .9 A does margin~2llytcduce the Fit Index. resulting in a reduction of the S coordination number to 2.6 ( similar to that for the uncomplexed cofactor, both with and without oxygen included). However, the coordination number and Debye-Waller factor for the oxygen do not behave well on

refinement. This sample illustrates the difficulty in assessing a liaht atom contribution within such a heavy scattering matrix due to correlationbetween parameters. Because ofthis correlation, oxygen has not been included in the simulation (see Table 1 and Figs. 4 and 5). It appears that in gene&, the average coordination in the primary Fe sphereis approximately 3, consisting of 2.5-3 S with the balance being light atoms. The new peak at w 3.1 W is less intense than with phenylthiol bound and is too weak to attempt identification. The addition of 1, 10 and 20 equiv. of phenylselenol to FeMoco was investigated. There were no significant changes to the Fe k-edge XANES compared to the uncomplexed cofactor. The Fourier transforms reveal a sharpening of the long Fe-Fe peak and no primary oxygen ligzmd is required, At higher ratios, there is a new shell at * 3.3 A of comparable intensity to the 3.6 A Fe shell. Although there are differences for shells of < 3 A, it is possible to obtain a fit without adding a selenium shell (that is, using the basic four-shell model and allowing coordination numbers and Debye-Waller factors to float freely ). However, in this situation the Fe-MO DebyeWallet factor refines to zero or negative, which is implausible. Subrtaction of the data for the uncomplexed cofactor from complexed data at all three ratios, clearly tevealsan additional contribution at * 2.4 A. Theonly satisfactory fit wasobtained using 0.2 f 0.04 Se at 2.356 f 0.002 8, with a Debye-Wallet factor of 0.009 A" ( 10:1 ratio). Addition of this shell to the basic four-shell model adequately simulates the data fot shells < 3 A without rhe need for significant further refinement.The selenium distance and coordination number are well defined when included in the full simulation. In this situ&on. the Se caordination number refines to 0, I2 ( i.e. approximately I pet coli\ctor) with rhe I: I date, whereas there ate 0.27 Se ( upproximntely 2 per cofaclor) iit higher ratios. Althou inclusion al'0.12 Se is the I : I data does marginally improve the Fit Index. the conrribulion is too small to be statistically significant. lsolarion of the new * 3.4 A peak (in the IO:1 and 20: 1 dnttk1 from the tlifferenct! spectrum su this long shell is also selenium ( -0.62 per iron) a( 7 ` 8. 4 The ratio of the two selenium-shell coordinalion nun,bets is plausible, suggesting one or possibly two irons dhzcrly binding selenium, with three to four of the remaining irons seeing the selenium(s) at a longer distance. The data for the I: IO and 1:20 ratios ate identical at the Fe k-edge. Therefore p:trumeters for the 1;1 and 1:IO ratios only are given in Table 1, The data and simulation of the I : IO data are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The binding of selenium to iron in FeMoco is clearly demonstrated by EXAFS data obtained a1the Se k-edge for a I: I sloichiometry of phenylselenol to cofactor.

km the results presented here. the ligands cxanriucd can be divided into two classes: f i) the phenylthiulate-like lipmds, for which either direct f in the cuscof phrnylselenulW1 or indirect ( i.e. the reduction in bound O/N and the observationof a new shell at approximately3.1 A) evidence has beenobtained indicating that iron is the site of ligaud

binding, and (ii) cyanate and thiocyanate, for which no evidence of binding was obtained. If the ratio of bound anion to iron was low, such binding may not be obvious at the iron edge due to averaging over all the irons in the cofactor. However, direct binding to iron of stmng multiple scatterers such as the inorganic anions chosen should be clear, especially given the high quality of the data. Although EPR studies suggest that cyanate and thiocyanate interact with FeMoco, in that a sharpening of the typical S= 3/2 spectrum 14,171 occurs on addition of these anions to FeMoco in NMF (not shown), no evidence to support this contention has been obtained from EXAFS. A bromine contribution at 2.53 A from Fe could be modelled using the 2-bromophenylthiolate-containing data. Although it could be argued that such an additional contribution led to the increase in intensity of the second shell, this was better modelled simply by decreasing the Debye-Wailer factor for the 2.61 8, Fe shell. The concomitant reduction in coordination number for this shell was unexpected and is difficult to explain. It is possible that rhe bromine has too many degrees of freedom, and thence too high a DebyeWailer factor to be detected by EXAFS or that the simpler simulation (without Br) is in fact inadequate. Accurately identifying the irc)n-to-selenium ratio from the iron edge was difiicult due to the averaging of the selenium contribution over the entire iron cnvironmcnt. However, the
vnlues obtainedare entirely consistent with Se k-edgeduto Obtlincd by ourselves und others 1 191. It should be borne in

These results, together with earlier studies of ligsnd binding to FeMoco in which a variety of other ligands were examined [ 9 I, reinforces the notion that molybdenum is unlikely to be involved directly in binding thiolate and selenolate ligands. The observed differences in behaviourbetween thiolate ligands may be related to steric factors reflecting the hulk of the ligand but further speculation based on current data is not profitable. Our data, together with those of Conradson et al. [ 191, clearly demonstrate that phenylthiolate and phenylselenolate bind an Fe site on FeMoco, presumably by displacement of a relatively weak ligand such as NMF, as discussed above. Whilst it is not possible to distinguish whether the bound iron is the terminal one originally ligated by CYS""~in the protein. or one of the other six irons in the FeMoco structural unit. nevertheless we intuitively favour the former site. It would follow from this and other evidence that cyanide binds to both Fe and MO in FeMoco [ 161 and that competitive binding between thiolate and cyanide to FeMoco [ 171 results in the terminal Fe being bound by thiolatc and the Mo by cyanide.
