The 23mer RNA corresponding to HIV-1 subtype-F DIS was purchased from Dharmacon and purified as described in [1]. RNA in water at a 120 µM concentration was heated at 90°C for 3 min and cooled to room temperature to mainly form DIS duplex instead of DIS hairpins [2]. For co-crystallization with aminoglycosides, buffer was added for a final concentration of 300 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM sodium cacodylate pH 6.2. RNA was then concentrated on a Centricon 10 K (Millipore) to a final concentration of 360 to 720 µM. Aminoglycosides were purchased from Sigma. Co-crystals of DIS duplex/aminoglycoside complexes were obtained by mixing 7 µl of RNA sample with 1.8 µl of a solution made with ribostamycin sulfate 5 mM in 30% (w/v) 2,4 methylpentanediol (MPD), with 1.0 µl lividomycin sulfate 2.5 mM in 30% MPD, with 1.0 µl paromomycin sulfate 5 mM in 30% MPD, or with 1.0-1.2 µl neomycin sulfate 5 mM in 30% MPD. Sitting drops were equilibrated over 1 to 7 days at 37°C against a reservoir containing 50% MPD, 300 mM KCl, 50 mM sodium cacodylate pH 6.2, 20 mM MgCl2. To obtain crystals of unbound DIS duplex, 1.0 µl of a solution containing 50 mM spermine chloride in 20-30% MPD was added to 7 µl of the RNA sample at 540 to 720 µM concentrations and drops were equilibrated against reservoir solution over 1 to 2 weeks at 37°C. These latter crystallization conditions are almost identical to the one reported for unbound subtype-A and subtype-B HIV-1 DIS duplex [1,
3]

. Another crystal form leading to nice and large crystals was obtained using a buffer made with 150 mM KCl, 25 mM sodium

cacodylate pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2 for the RNA sample and after 2-3 days at 37°C, but it diffracts only poorly and we did not try to improve the quality of these crystals. Crystals were then transferred at 20°C and frozen in liquid ethane for data collection. Flash freezing in liquid nitrogen or gas nitrogen at 90 K led to poorly diffracting crystals. For structure solving, uridine 3 of the DIS RNA was substituted into a 2'methylseleno-uridine

in complexes involving neomycin, lividomycin and ribostamycin. Data were collected with 1° oscillation
[6]

at 90 K on various beamlines (Table 1) at the ESRF synchrotron (Grenoble, France) and processed using the HKL package [5]. The structure of the ribostamycin/DIS complex was solved by MAD using the program SHARP (with 40% solvent content) with the DM program in the CCP4 package refined with the CNS package neomycin using MOLREP

, followed with a solvent flattening

resolution range. The unbound duplex was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP using the HIV-1 subtype-A duplex [3] as a starting model. No correct solution could be found using free HIV-1 subtype-B duplex aminoglycosides. or subype-F duplex bound to

Supplementary figure 7: Detailed view of the HIV-1 subtype-F DIS duplex/paromomycin complex: intramolecular contacts observed for A273 masking the paromomycin from the solvent in the drug pocket. Contacts observed are N1(A273)-2'OH(C281'), N6(A273)-N2(G271) and N6(A273)-O4'(A282'). The solvent accessible surface of the paromomycin is represented.

Supplementary figure 8: Comparison of DIS duplex/aminoglycoside complexes (phosphates 274 to 280 of both strands were superimposed; the r.m.s.d. lies between 0.26 and 0.59 Å). Ribostamycin is in orange, lividomycin in red, neomycin in blue and paromomycin in green. RNA strands are represented from light to dark grey in the same order. The bulged-out A273 residue folded back to the minor groove in the duplex/paromomycin complex is shown with a back arrow. This picture shows the rigidity of the ribostamycin core, whereas rings IV and V of aminoglycosides are more flexible. It also emphasizes the similarity of all RNA structures, except for A272 and A273 that are highly mobile.

The duplex in absence of drug is shown in light red and green and the structure obtained with paromomycin is shown in red and green. The solvent accessible surface of the paromomycin is also represented. The top figure is the superimposition obtained with all phosphates, whereas only phosphates of the "stem" region are superimposed on the bottom (residues 265 to 271 and 281 to 287).

Phosphates of residues 274 to 280 of each strand were superimposed. a) Stereo overall view of each DIS-ribostamycin complex. This figure shows that the DIS kissing-loop complex length is about 3 Å longer that the DIS duplex one. b) Stereo view emphasizing differences in DIS duplex and kissing-loop bound to ribostamycin due to the RNA topology (duplex vs. loop-loop interaction), and despite the excellent agreement for each 'A site motif'.
