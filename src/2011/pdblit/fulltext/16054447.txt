Abstract We devised a growth-based strategy for screening phosphotriesterase mutant libraries for variants with enhanced activity towards organophosphates that generate dimethyl phosphate when hydrolysed. Phosphotriesterase mutants were screened for activity by growing transformed Escherichia coli on agar plates containing methyl paraoxon as a sole phosphorus source. E. coli is capable of growth under these conditions when coexpressing the phosphotriesterase from Agrobacterium radiobacter P230 (OpdA) and the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase from Enterobacter aerogenes (GpdQ). The latter enzyme can hydrolyse the dimethyl phosphate produced by the phosphotriesterase to methyl phosphate, which can then be used by E. coli as a source of phosphate. Phosphotriesterase was expressed from the lac promoter at levels such that its activity was growth-rate limiting. Cultures of the largest colonies (1% of the transformants) were assayed for activity towards paraoxon spectrophotometrically in microtitre plates. This process produced E. coli variants with higher whole cell activity than wild-type, which was found to be a consequence of increased protein expression rather than any increase in enzymatic activity. The mutations present in these mutant enzymes with increased expression were exclusively in the coding region, suggesting the improvement occurs post-transcriptionally.  2005 Elsevier Inc.

Organophosphate triesters have been widely used as insecticides for the last 60 years. Their primary mode of action is the irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, which results in retardation of nerve signal transduction and consequential death to the organism [1]. Although toxic to humans, bacteria have evolved ways of degrading these compounds so that they do not accumulate in the environment. Bacterial phosphotriesterases catalyse the hydrolysis of a broad range of phosphotriesters with varying eYciencies. For example, the kcat/Km of the phosphotriesterase from Agrobacterium radiobacter P230 (OpdA) for methyl paraoxon hydrolysis is nearly diVusion rate limited (107 M¡1 s¡1), whereas

the kcat/Km towards ethyl demeton hydrolysis is considerably lower (103 M¡1 s¡1) [2]. A variety of techniques have been used to evolve phosphotriesterases for increased activity towards relatively poor substrates. The phosphotriesterase from Pseudomonas diminuta MG (OPH) has been modiWed by altering amino acid residues previously identiWed as those most likely responsible for substrate selectivity based on well-deWned crystal structures with substrate analogues. This rational design approach has been used successfully to enhance its phosphodiesterase activity [3], enhance or reverse the stereospeciWcity [4], and increase the activity towards relatively poor substrates like diisopropyl Xuorophosphate [5] and ethyl demeton [6]. A slight variation to this approach involves the screening of mutant libraries generated by randomising the amino acid composition at such positions. Most

recently, Hill et al. [7] used this approach to improve the activity of OPH towards a chromogenic analogue of the phosphonoXuoridate soman by nearly 1000-fold. GriYths and TawWk [8] identiWed variants with a 63-fold enhancement in kcat towards ethyl paraoxon from a large library (107) of OPH mutants using a combination of in vitro compartmentalisation and Xow cytometry. Two approaches screening randomly generated libraries in vivo have been documented. Cho et al. [9,10] have successfully screened a randomly generated OPH library expressed on the cell surface of Escherichia coli for increased activity towards methyl parathion and chlorpyrifos by use of agarose overlays or plates containing these substrates. Similarly, Yang et al. [2] used hydrolysis of a Xuorigenic substrate (coumaphos-o-analogue) present in the growth media to identify E. coli colonies expressing OPH variants with the greatest activity. Cultures of these isolates were then assayed spectrophotometrically against a selection of substrates (coumaphos-o-analogue, methyl parathion, and methyl paraoxon) to identify the most active variants. Both of these methods were successful in producing mutant enzymes with increased activity toward a range of organophosphate triesters. An alternative approach for screening phosphotriesterase variants is to use the reaction product as a source of nutrition. If the phosphotriesterase activity is regulated such that it was growth-rate limiting, then mutants with increased activity would enable the host cell to grow faster than its neighbours. One advantage of such a strategy is the capacity to screen mutants speciWcally for enhanced activity towards substrates that do not generate a coloured or Xuorigenic product. Another advantage is the potential for screening larger libraries than can be screened using other in vivo methods. In a previous study, we demonstrated that E. coli coexpressing the phosphotriesterase, OpdA, and the non-speciWc glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase from Enterobacter aerogenes, GpdQ, can grow on minimal media plates using methyl paraoxon as a sole phosphorus source [11]. The catabolism of a phosphotriester to phosphate is outlined in Fig. 1. OpdA was expressed

at low levels from a lac promoter cloned into a derivative of the medium copy number plasmid pACYC184. OpdA expression was largely repressed by the expression of lacI repressor protein from the lacIq allele cloned into the same plasmid. The E. aerogenes GpdQ was expressed under phosphate-limiting conditions from its native promoter as part of a putative glycerol-3-phosphate uptake operon (ugp) cloned into the high copy number plasmid pBluescript. This operon enables the E. coli strain DH10B to grow using dimethyl phosphate (DMP), a hydrolysis product of many phosphotriesters, as a sole phosphorus source. In this study, we report the directed evolution of enhanced phosphotriesterase activity in OpdA using the strategy of coupling its activity to E. coli growth as a means of selecting more active variants. We found that using this approach as the Wrst component of a twotiered screening process was useful for identifying mutants that are better expressed in E. coli.

Materials and methods Strains, plasmids, and chemicals The plasmids used in this report are listed in Table 1. The methods used to construct the plasmids pSYM1 and pSYM5 were previously described [11]. The gene encoding OPH (opd) was cloned between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pSYM5 in a similar manner to that used for the gene opdA, to make pSYM6. The E. coli strain DH10B transformed with pSYM1 (GpdQ+ cells) was used to screen OpdA mutant libraries for activity. pSYM5 was used for both the screening of OpdA mutant libraries and subsequent protein overexpression. Cells expressing mutant libraries were grown on modiWed MOPS minimal media using 0.1 mM methyl paraoxon as the sole phosphorus source [11,12]. Under these conditions, the phosphotriesters were stable for at least 2 weeks at 4 °C. Otherwise, cells were grown using LB media. Growth media were supplemented with ampicillin (100 g ml¡1) and/or chloramphenicol (34 g ml¡1) as required. Methyl

paraoxon (paraoxon) was purchased from Chem Service. Dimethyl phosphate (DMP) was purchased from Acros Organics. The purity of the organophosphates was > 95% as stated by the manufacturers. Molecular biology reagents were purchased from NEB or Roche. Biochemicals were purchased from Sigma. DNA puriWcations were done using QIAGEN kits. Library creation Two rounds of mutagenesis and screening for higher activity toward the substrate methyl paraoxon were performed. The Wrst round of mutagenesis was performed using error-prone PCR ampliWcation of opdA using Vent exo-DNA polymerase essentially as described [13]. The primers used were: fp 5 TTAAATAAGGAGGAATAAACCATGG 3 and rp 5 TCTCGAGCTCGGATCCCGTTATTAC 3 . After 30 cycles, the PCR product was puriWed and then digested with NcoI and BamHI restriction enzymes. The digested 1 kb band was gel extracted and ligated into the same dephosphorylated sites of pSYM5 (with opdA wild-type removed). The second round of mutagenesis involved the gene shuZing of those mutant genes selected from the Wrst round of screening. The method used was essentially as described [14]. ModiWcations are as follows: after incubation on ice for »45 min, DNaseI digestion of PCR product was stopped with SDS (0.1%) and the DNA concentrated by ethanol precipitation. Following restriction digest, the Wnal primer PCR product was cloned into pSYM5 as above. The eVects of mutagenesis were monitored by DNA sequencing analysis of a random selection of transformants. Library screening for increased paraoxon hydrolysis The best variants from the library generated using error-prone PCR were selected by their growth on paraoxon plates. DH10B pSYM1 electrocompetent cells were transformed with the puriWed library ligation mix by electroporation. After the 1 h recovery incubation, the transformation mix was rinsed of media with water three times before being plated on paraoxon plates. The total number of colonies screened per round of mutagenesis was »200,000 at a cell density of »2000 colonies per plate. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2­4 days. The largest 1­3 colonies from each plate were streaked

on these selection plates and incubated at 37 °C for 1 day (»220 colonies). Three millilitre lots of LB media were inoculated with the restreaked cells and incubated at 37 °C, 200 rpm, »15 h. For paraoxon screening, cultures were diluted 1:50 in water. Five microlitres of diluted cultures was transferred to microtitre plates, then assayed for paraoxon activity by addition of 95 l of reaction mix (100 mM Mops, pH 7.0, 1% MeOH, and 0.1 mM paraoxon), and monitored for the the release of p-nitrophenol at 405 nm over 30 min at room temperature. The plasmids from the 40 most active cultures were extracted and pSYM1 was linearised by SmaI digest, to remove this plasmid from future transformations. DH10B was transformed with the digestion mix, then incubated at 37 °C overnight on LB plates. Two colonies from each of the 40 plates were restreaked on LB plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Three-millilitre lots of LB media were inoculated with single colonies and incubated at 37 °C, 200 rpm, »15 h. Cultures were diluted and assayed for activity as above in duplicate. The plasmid DNA from the 14 most active isolates was used as the template for DNA shuZing. After screening the shuZed library in a similar manner, the expression level of OpdA in the 10 most active isolates was analysed by SDS­PAGE of crude lysates. The DNA from 10 cultures was extracted and opdA sequenced. Preparation of puriWed phosphotriesterases Cells expressing OPH, OpdA wild-type, or mutants were grown in LB media (1 L) to OD595 D 0.5. Phosphotriesterase expression was induced with addition of 0.5 mM IPTG and incubated at 37 °C, 200 rpm for another 3 h. All of the following steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were pelleted and then resuspended with 20 mM Hepes, pH 8.0. Cells were lysed using a French press (14,000 p.s.i.) and the soluble fraction was isolated after centrifugation. The soluble fraction was passed through a DEAE­Fractogel column (Merck) at 1 ml/min. Active Xow-through fractions were dialysed versus 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, overnight. The dialysate was loaded onto a SP­Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) at 1 ml/min. A linear NaCl gradient (0­1 M) was applied over 10 column volumes to elute bound proteins. Eluted fractions were assayed for phosphotriesterase activity by reaction of 1 l of eluate in 100 l of 10 M

coumaphos-o-analogue in 100 mM Hepes, pH 8.0. Phosphotriesterase activity was eluted at »150 mM NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and found to be »95% pure by SDS­PAGE analysis. The pooled fractions were dialysed versus 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CoCl2·6H2O, pH 7.5, overnight. Protein concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and using a molar extinction coeYcient of 29,160 M¡1 cm¡1. In vitro assays of puriWed phosphotriesterases All in vitro assays were performed at room temperature in 100 mM Tris­Cl, 2% MeOH, pH 8.5. The kcat/Km of puriWed phosphotriesterases towards paraoxon hydrolysis was determined by measuring release of pnitrophenol at 405 nm ( 405 D 18,050 M¡1 s¡1) [15]. Phosphotriesterases were diluted in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mg ml¡1 bovine serum albumin before use. Assays were conducted in duplicate.

These sequences were unique. Cultures of 30 randomly selected transformants were assayed for paraoxon activity. Fifty percentage of isolates had between 10 and 100% of OpdA wild-type activity, whereas the other 50% of isolates had <10% of OpdA wild-type activity. DNA shuZing was used to recombine mutations isolated from Round 1 without incorporating new mutations. Therefore, a high Wdelity DNA polymerase was used (Pfu DNA polymerase). To determine the mutation rate of DNA shuZing using the described protocol, opdA wild-type was used as the sole template. The mutation rate and the activity proWle were determined as for the errorprone PCR library. The library generated using shuZing had a mutation rate of 0­1 amino acid changes per gene (mean D 0.1). Ninety-four percent of the transformants had OpdA wild-type activity, whereas 6% of the isolates had between 10 and 50% of OpdA wild-type activity. Library screening for increased paraoxon hydrolysis After the Wrst round of mutagenesis and screening, it was found that 10 unique mutants had activity up to 1.3-fold higher than wild-type towards paraoxon. The amino acid changes are listed in Table 2. Interestingly, the mutation A80V was found in 5 of the 10 mutants. One mutant exhibited lower activity than wild-type over 30 min, but was able to hydrolyse a greater amount of paraoxon after 3 h than wild-type (1.82). SDS­PAGE demonstrated that the majority of these mutants were expressed at greater levels than wild-type OpdA in E. coli. ShuZing and screening the genes from the best Round 1 mutants produced 12 mutants with up to two times wildtype activity, that all expressed at greater levels than wildtype. The amino acid changes of these 12 mutants are also listed in Table 2. Amino acid mutations were lost at nine positions from Round 1 to Round 2, while two new mutations were introduced. The A80V, L249H/F, V250I, and A259G mutations were all signiWcantly over-represented. To investigate whether diVusion of substrate across the cell membrane was an activity-limiting factor for the in vivo assays, the activity of whole cells and lysed cells towards paraoxon was compared. Lysates of cells expressing PTE, OpdA wild-type, and the 12 mutants selected from Round 2 of the paraoxon screen were prepared by freeze/thawing lysozyme-treated cells [16]. It was found that the activities of intact cells and cell lysates were similar for PTE and OpdA. However, the whole-cell activity of the most active Round 2 isolates was up to 3-fold less than that of cell lysates (Table 3). The most active mutant had a cell lysate activity »3-fold higher than OpdA wild-type (2.242).

Results Growth rate comparison of OpdA¡, OpdA+, and OPH+ cells To test the ability of this screening method to diVerentiate phosphotriesterase variants of diVerent activities, the growth rates of OpdA¡, OpdA+, and OPH+ cells on paraoxon plates were compared. GpdQ+ cells were transformed with pACYC184, pSYM5, pSYM6, or a mix of all three plasmids, then plated on the selection plates. After incubation at 37 °C for 2­3 days, 10 large and 10 small colonies from each plate were streaked on LB plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Overnight cultures were assayed for whole cell activity towards paraoxon as described above. On paraoxon plates, OpdA+ cells grew to »1 mm after 2­3 days, whereas OPH+ cells had grown to »0.2 mm after the same period. Assays on overnight cultures of 10 large and 10 small colonies from the mixed plate found that all 10 large-colony cultures exhibited OpdA-like activity, whereas all 10 small-colony cultures exhibited OPH-like activity. SDS­PAGE examination of OPH and OpdA expression in uninduced overnight cultures shows that the expression level of OpdA was »2-fold higher than that of OPH. Previous assays on puriWed OPH and OpdA showed that OpdA exhibits 12fold greater kcat/Km towards paraoxon than OPH [2]. Library creation The library generated using error-prone PCR had a mutation rate of 1­5 amino acid changes per gene (mean D 2.4, SD D 1.3) as determined by DNA sequencing of 10 randomly selected transformants.

activity towards phosphotriester pesticides via the coupling of phosphotriesterase activity to growth rate. This strategy was tested using the substrate methyl paraoxon. Mutagenesis and screening identiWed one primary class of mutants that were expressed at higher levels than wild-type in E. coli while retaining signiWcant activity. The potential use of this strategy for the identiWcation of mutants that are better able to be expressed in E. coli may be of interest to those considering the use of phosphotriesterases for bioremediation or industrial purposes, where the activity per cell is of greater importance than the speciWc activity. Directed evolution has been used to increase the cellular activity of proteins by selecting for variants with a combination of higher speciWc activity and improved expression levels [17­19]. The identiWcation of isolates with increased activity per cell, and the inability to isolate a mutant with greater speciWc activity towards paraoxon, suggests that no further improvement in speciWc activity towards this substrate was possible using this strategy. These Wndings also suggest that if a mutant with enhanced speciWc activity were generated, it would probably be identiWed by the secondary screen. For our strategy to work most eVectively, it is important that the phosphotriesterase activity is regulated such that it is growth-rate limiting. Ideally, phosphotriesterase activity should be high enough to produce suYcient phosphate for growth, yet low enough so that any increase in activity results in faster colony growth. Given the logistics of reducing expression level by modiWcation

of the promoter or ribosome binding site, the ultimate use of this strategy may be the screening out from a library those mutants with signiWcant reductions in activity, rather than the direct selection of improved mutants. The relationship between phosphotriesterase activity and the production of phosphate is more complicated than anticipated. In a previous study, we described how addition of paraoxon inhibited the growth of GpdQ+ cells using DMP as a phosphorus source [11]. Subsequent in vitro assays showed that paraoxon was a substrate for GpdQ, albeit a poor one. Assuming that paraoxon inhibits GpdQ+ cell growth by competing with DMP at the GpdQ active site, the inhibitory eVect will be greater in the absence of supplementary DMP, as is the case when using the phosphotriester as sole source of phosphorus. Our strategy may have certain limitations. First, the phosphotriester must not be broken down either in the media or by an E. coli enzyme at a rate that renders OpdA activity superXuous for growth. In a previous study, GpdQ was found to have signiWcant activity towards the phosphorothiolate methyl demeton [11]. OpdA¡ GpdQ+ and OpdA+ GpdQ+ strains grew at similar rates using methyl demeton as a sole phosphorus source. In the event that the target phosphotriester is a substrate of the phosphodiesterase, then we suggest that an alternative phosphodiesterase with greater speciWcity towards DMP can be used [20]. Second, we have not investigated whether this strategy can be used to select for phosphotriesterases with increased activity towards phosphotriesters with diethyl substituents. However, as it has been previously shown that GpdQ has activity towards diethyl phosphate, we suspect that this strategy may be useful for such substrates [21]. Papers describing the surface expression of OPH in E. coli have suggested that transport of phosphotriesters across the cell membrane may limit the turnover rate of organophosphates [22]. We found that this was the case only when the cellular activity level of OpdA

mutants towards paraoxon rose above that of OpdA wild-type. These results indicate that while rapid detoxiWcation is probably most eYciently done using cells expressing phosphotriesterase on the cell surface, diVerentiation of cells expressing phosphotriesterases with varying activities can be made inside the cell when the expression level is low. Over two rounds of directed evolution of OpdA toward paraoxon, no signiWcant improvement in catalytic activity was detected. However, as a consequence of increased expression, E. coli colonies were selected that possessed signiWcantly greater activity than E. coli expressing wild-type OpdA. The abundance of these mutant enzymes that were expressed at higher levels than wild-type OpdA was interesting. Analysis of the nucleotide and amino acid changes of the most active paraoxon mutant identiWed from the secondary screen, 2.242, shows Wve amino acid changes from Wve single nucleotide changes (Table 2). Of these changes, the A80V, L249H/F, V250I, and A259G mutations were all signiWcantly overrepresented in the most active mutants. We have not undertaken a detailed investigation into the causes of the increased expression. We suspected that as OpdA was derived from a diVerent organism to E. coli in A. radiobacter [23], the mutations might have optimised the codon usage of the gene for expression in its new host. However, examination of codon changes found that only one might produce a signiWcant improvement. The codon change (AGA ! AAA) that caused the R91K mutation represents a change from an infrequently used codon to one more commonly used, while retaining a positive charge. However, R91K occurred in only 2 of the 14 best Round 2 mutants, suggesting that its inclusion is probably of minimal importance. If the change conferred an evolutionary advantage by allowing higher expression of OpdA, then it would be expected to occur with greater frequency in the population of improved mutants. In contrast, the A80V, L249H/F, V250I, and A259G mutations result in little change to codon usage. Assuming that codon usage is not a factor, other possible advantages the observed changes may provide include more eYcient protein folding or increased mRNA/protein stability. Structural analysis shows that all mutations identiWed in Round 2, with the exception of V250I, were located on the surface of the protein, suggesting they may contribute to protein stability. IdentiWcation of mutants that are expressed at higher levels in E. coli may be of interest to those considering the use of phosphotriesterases for bioremediation or industrial purposes, where the activity per cell is of greater importance than the speciWc activity of the enzyme. In this case, directed evolution has been used to increase the cellular activity of proteins by selecting for mutants with improved expression levels [17­19]. The inability to isolate a mutant with greater speciWc activity towards paraoxon suggests that no further improvement

in speciWc activity towards this substrate was possible using this strategy. We envisage that the screening of randomly generated mutant libraries using the strategy described in this paper may prove useful for the identiWcation of mutants with improved activity of phosphotriesterases towards poor substrates.
