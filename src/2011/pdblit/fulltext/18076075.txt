INTRODUCTION Cyclophilins belong to a ubiquitous protein family that catalyses the reaction of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) on their ligand proteins, and they play a crucial role in protein folding.1­3 Proteins in the cyclophilin family are found in a variety of organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, including humans.4 Five isoforms are known among human cyclophlins.2,5,6 One of these isoforms, cyclophilin D (CypD), is a mitochondriaspecific cyclophilin.2 CypD is known to play a pivotal role in mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), which leads to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DC), mitochondrial swelling, rupture of the outer membrane, and finally necrotic cell death.7 CypD knock-out mice do not have any detectable phenotypic anomalies, but they resist ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury in the heart8,9 and brain.10 Although the exact target protein molecule for CypD PPIase activity is still unknown, these findings reported to date have suggested CypD as a potential drug target to treat cerebral and myocardial infarctions. An immunosuppressive compound, cyclosporin A (CsA), is known to bind to the proteins of this family and inhibits PPIase activity of cyclophilins and MPT.3, 11 Several crystal structures of cyclophilin including that of CypD have been determined,12­14 but thus far, no structures of CypD complexed with ligands have been determined. It is essential to obtain structural information about CypD-ligand interactions for the development of a

CypD-specific inhibitor as an anti-infarction drug. Accordingly, we have determined the ultrahigh resolution ° crystal structure of CypD in complex with CsA at 0.96-A resolution. MATERIALS AND METHODS The human CypD expression system starting from Gly2 was constructed as described by Schlatter et al.14 The calculated molecular weight of this CypD recombinant is 17.8 kDa. The gene was cloned into a pET-21a vector (NOVAGEN) using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, and a mutation of Lys133 into Ile was introduced on the CypD gene. Expression was conducted in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Cell culturing and the induction of CypD expression were also performed as previously described.14 Purification was performed with Hi-trap SP, RESOURCE Q, and Superdex 75 chromatography instead of with the EMD COO2, Q-sepharose, and EMD BioSEC columns used by Schlatter et al.14 The

supernatant of the cell homogenate was applied to a Hitrap SP column equilibrated with buffer A (100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.8, 2 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT). Bound CypD proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0­0.5 M NaCl. The CypD fractions were desalted with dialysis against buffer A and applied onto a ResourceQ column equilibrated with buffer A. CypD did not bind to the column, and the flowthrough fraction was further purified with a Superdex75 column equilibrated with buffer B (50 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT). Thirteen milligrams of CypD were harvested from 5 g of E. coli cells. For the crystallization, 25 mg/mL of purified CypD in buffer B was used. CsA, isolated from the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum, was purchased from CALBIOCHEM. Two milligrams of CsA powder were incubated with 100 lL of CypD solution for 5 days in order to obtain the CypD and CsA complex. The nondissolved CsA was removed with a 0.22-lm filter. Rod-shaped crystals of the complex were obtained within a day using 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 45 mM sodium-citrate buffer at pH 2.9 as a precipitant solution. The crystals were grown to an approximate maximum rod-length of 1.0 mm. The crystals were dipped in a cryoprotectant buffer (35% polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium-citrate buffer at pH 2.9) for 10 s and were flash-frozen in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Two sets of diffraction data were collected at the beamline NW12A at Photon Factory, Ibaraki, and at the beamline BL41XU at SPring-8, Hyogo, Japan. The initial dataset was collected with a wavelength ° of 1.000 A in Photon Factory. The crystal was exposed for 1.0 s for 1.08 oscillation with a 0.5-mm aluminum attenuator for the low-resolution dataset, and for 3.0 s for 0.58 oscillation without the aluminum attenuator for the high-resolution dataset. The images were integrated ° with HKL200015 from 50 to 2.2 A and from 2.5- to ° resolution for the low- and high-resolution data1.06-A sets, respectively. The merged data were phased with the molecular replacement method using Molrep.16,17 The structure of human apo-CypD (PDB ID: 2BIT) was employed as a search model. Model-building and refinement were carried out using COOT18 and REFMAC5,19 respectively. The second dataset was collected at SPring-8 with a 0.1-s exposure for 1.08 oscillation with a 0.3-mm alumi° num attenuator using a wavelength of 1.000 A X-ray for the low-resolution dataset, and with a 0.4-s exposure for 0.58 oscillation without the aluminum attenuator, using a ° wavelength of 0.85 A X-ray for the high-resolution data° set. Integration was performed from 200 to 2.2 A and ° for the low- and high-resolution datafrom 2.5 to 0.96 A sets, respectively. The integrated intensities were scaled and merged into one dataset. Model building was carried out based on the partially refined structure using the initial dataset at Photon Factory. The structure was finally

Preparation of the crystallization sample

A K133I mutant of human CypD, instead of the wildtype enzyme, was employed to obtain the present crystal of the CypD-CsA complex, because it was reported that this mutant showed the reasonable solubility in water and the similar activity with the wild-type enzyme, and afforded crystals suitable for the X-ray work.14 CsA shows low solubility for water. CsA is usually soluble in organic solvents such as DMSO and ethanol, which are unsuitable for protein crystallization. We therefore prepared the CypD-CsA complex without the use of organic solvents, and instead utilized the high solubility of CypD in water and its strong affinity to CsA. The addition of a small amount of CsA in ethanol to the aqueous CypD solution resulted in the immediate formation of white precipitants. This precipitation might have been CsA, the solubility of which is very low in water. However, the precipitation disappeared after 3 days of incubation. This result implied that CsA was

soluble in the aqueous CypD solution, and that the CypD-CsA complex could be formed by the incubation of a CypD solution with CsA powders. In order to drive all CypD molecules in the solution to form a complex with CsA, excess CsA was added to the aqueous CypD solution and the mixture was incubated for 5 days. As described in the following paragraph, the crystal structure indicated that the CypD-CsA complex was successfully formed according to this protocol, which can be applied for the crystallization of protein­ligand complexes with various water-insoluble ligands.

unit. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.
Overall structure

The structure of human CypD is composed of eight b-strands, two a-helices, and one 310 helix [Fig. 1(A)], and this structure is similar to that of the other known cyclophilin structures. The RMSDs between the Ca atoms of the present structure and those of CypA-CsA, CypB° CsA, CypC-CsA, and CypE(apo) are 0.50 A (for 164 ° ° atoms), 0.67 A (159 atoms), 0.68 A (158 atoms), and ° 0.68 A (161 atoms), respectively. The Fo-Fc map phased only with the CypD structure showed additional clear electron densities corresponding to the CsA molecule, confirming that the crystal was composed of the CypD-CsA complex [Fig. 1(B)]. The ° averaged B-factors of CypD and CsA are 6.7 A2 (2812 ° 2 (179 nonhydrogen nonhydrogen atoms) and 6.5 A atoms), respectively. This suggests that the CsA molecule is rigidly bound to the CypD molecule to form the stable CypD-CsA complex. This finding is consistent with the very strong affinity of CsA to CypD (KD5 13.4 nM).14 The CypD structure in the present complex is very simi° lar to that of apo-CypD (RMSD of Ca 5 0.48 A for 164 atoms), suggesting that CypD does not need to undergo a conformational change in order to bind with CsA, in spite of the fact that CsA (1.2 kDa) has one-fifteenth of the molecular weight of CypD (17.8 kDa). The mutated Ile133 was involved in the important intermolecular contacts in the apocrystal.14 In the present crystal composed of two CypD-CsA complexes in an asymmetric unit, one of the two CypD complexes makes no contact with the other complex via Ile133, but Ile133 on the other CypD molecule is directly involved in the intercomplex interaction. Therefore, wild-type CypD is not considered to form the present crystal packing arrangement found in the case of apo-CypD.
Binding with CsA

binding site. Residues Ser59, Ser81, Arg82, Ile117, Lys148, and Ser149 of CypD are located around the CsA binding site, and they are not well conserved in the other cyclophilins (CypA, CypB, CypC, and CypE). These residues are thought to specifically recognize the ligand proteins. Molecules that bind to these residues could be a leading compound as CypD-specific inhibitors, and they may therefore serve as potential targets for the development of anti-infarction drugs.

The binding mode of CsA with CypD is shown on Figure 1(C). One-half of CsA residues (Sar3-Dal8) is exposed to the solvent region and the other half (Bmt1, Aba2, and Mle9-Mva11) is buried in the CypD molecule. Since CsA is a cyclic peptide composed of hydrophobic residues, the molecule interacts with CypD primarily via hydrophobic contacts. Hydrogen bonds are formed only using main-chain N and O atoms of CsA [Fig. 1(C)]. The amino-acid sequence identities of CypD with CypA, CypB, CypC, and CypE are 75%, 61%, 58%, and 67%, respectively. These highly conserved residues are distributed across the molecular surface, as shown in Figure 1(D). All residues in contact with CsA are completely conserved in all human cyclophilins. The PPIase active site is known to be located at the bottom of the CsA
