The Saccharomyces cerevisiae GPR1 (G-protein coupled receptor) gene was isolated using two-hybrid system with a heterotrimeric GTP binding protein a subunit Gpa2p as a bait. The GPR1 gene encodes 961 amino acids with predicted seven transmembrane segments and two large cytosolic regions as third cytosolic loop with 350 amino acids where asparagine-rich region was found and the C-terminal region with 283 amino acids. The Gpr1p interacted with Gpa2p at Cterminal region with 131 amino acid residues as well as third cytosolic loop. Disruption of the GPR1 gene was not lethal and did not affect to the cell growth. The Gpr1p-GFP fusion protein localized at the cell surface. These results suggest that Gpr1p is a G-protein coupled receptor which localized at plasma membrane. It is likely that a Gpr1p monitors the extracellular signal such as nutrition and transduce it via Gpa2p a possible positive regulator of cAMP level. 1997 Academic Press

via a cAMP dependent manner (2). It was also shown that the GPA2 is necessary for normal growth on rich medium in cells that lack Ras2p (2). These results indicated that a Gpa2p was involved in the regulation of intracellular cAMP level, most likely as a positive regulator of adenylyl cyclase. In the present study, we describe the isolation of GPR1 gene encoding a putative receptor molecule with possible seven transmembrane region which interacts with Gpa2p. Our results suggest that the Gpr1p interacted with Gpa2p at two regions, a third cytosolic loop and a C-terminal end. It was also shown that the Gpr1p-GFP fusion localize at the plasma membrane. Thus, it is likely that a Gpr1p monitors the extracellular signal such as nutrition and transduce it via Gpa2p to regulate the intracellular cAMP level. MATERIAL AND METHODS
Yeast strains and media. The yeast strains used in this experiment are haploid strains SH4848; W303-1A(a) ura3-1 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 his3-11,15 ade2-1 and SH4849; W303-1B(a) ura3-1 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 his3-11,15 ade2-1 which were isolated from W303; MATa/ MATa ade2-1/ade2-1 his3-11,15/his3-11,15 leu2-3,112/leu2-3,112 trp1-1/trp1-1 ura3-1/ura3-1. YPD medium contained 2% pepton, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose. SD medium contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) and 2% glucose. SD medium was supplemented with auxotrophic requirements. Cloning. A DNA fragment containing GPA2 gene was amplified by PCR (3) with primers (5 -CTCCTAATAGCGTCGTTGGT-3 and 5 -TGGTCAAATGGTAATAAGGA-3 ) using genomic DNA from S. cerevisiae as a template. A 4kb of amplified DNA fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (PROMEGA). A 2.9 kb DNA fragment of GPR1 was amplified by PCR with primers (forward; 5 -TCTCCAACTCCATATGATAACTGA-3 , reverse; 5 -ATTCATGTCGGCTACTTGTC-3 ). The forward primer was synthesized to introduce Nde I site at the start codon of GPR1 with 2 mismatched nucleotides (underlined) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector to construct pGEM-T/GPR1-Nde I. The cloning of genomic DNA containing GPR1 was also performed. The Eco RV digested genomic DNA fragments around 5kb in size were subcloned into plasmid pRS413 (Stratagene) and transformed E. coli DH5a to construct size fractionated yeast

The heterotrimeric G-proteins are key regulators of growth and development in eukaryote cells. In mammalian cells, many heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein a subunits modulate cAMP levels through adenylyl cyclase, while Ras functions to regulate the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway in response to growth factors. In S. cerevisiae, there found two distinct Gprotein a subunit genes (GPA1 and GPA2). But only GPA1 has been well studied and shown to be involved in negative regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway upon pheromone stimulation. Though GPA2 has been thought to be involved in cAMP regulation, detailed study has not yet been done (1). Very recently, it was reported that the Gpa2p regulates the growth and pseudohyphal development in S. cerevisiae

BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS I fragment (containing GFP ORF) of pS65T-C1(Clontech) in which Eco RI site had been removed was subcloned into Xba I-Pst I site of pUC119 to construct pUC119/GFP. A 3.8kb PstI fragment of pUC119/GPR1 was subcloned into pUC119 which lack Sma I and Afl III sites to construct pUC119/GPR-AS0 in which GPR1 ORF lies in reverse direction to lac promoter. A 0.1kb of Sac I fragment was removed from pUC119/GPR-AS0 to construct pUC119/GPR1-ASS0. The 0.65 kb of Pst I-Sma I fragment of pUC119/GPR1-ASS0 was replaced by Sma I-Pst I fragment of pUC119/GFP to construct pGPR1-GFP. A 3.8 kb of Sac I fragment of pGPR1-GFP was subcloned into YEp type vector pYE1 to construct pGPR1-GFP/YEp which produce Gpr1p-GFP fusion protein. Microscopic analysis. To determine the localization of Gpr1pGFP fusion protein in S. cerevisiae, SH4848 cells were transformed with plasmid pGPR1-GFP/YEp. The transformants were grown in SD media supplemented with adenine, L-histidine, uracil, L-leucine at 30 C for 12h. The Cell culture was spotted on a microscope slide and covered with a coverslip. Slides were mounted on an Olympus fluorescence microscope BX50 and viewed with both Nomarski and a Olympus U-MWIB filter for fluorescein fluorescence with illumination at 460-490nm and emission at 515nm. Images were taken directly from an Olympus CCD camera HCC-600 attached to the microscope and printed out by a Hitachi color video printer VY170.

genomic library. A GPR1 genomic clone (4.9kb) was isolated by colony hybridization with 2.9kb of PCR amplified GPR1 fragment as a probe. A 3.8 kb Pst I fragment of the GPR1 genomic clone was subcloned into pUC119 and pRS416 (Stratagene) to construct pUC119/ GPR1 and pRS416/GPR1, respectively. All sequence amplified by PCR was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Two-hybrid analysis (4). A Mlu I and Sph I fragment (1.4kb) of the GPA2 was blunted and subcloned into SmaI site of pAS2-1 two hybrid DNA binding domain vector in-frame to construct pAS2-1/ GPA2. Chromosomal DNA extracted from S. cerevisiae was partially digested with Sau 3AI and ligated into the BamHI site of the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain vector pACT2 and E. coli DH5a was transformed to construct two-hybrid genomic library with 3 1 105 independent clones. The plasmid DNA was isolated directly from transformed E. coli DH5a colonies. S. cerevisiae Y190 cells were cotransformed with the pAS2-1/GPA2 and the pACT2 genomic library plasmid using the lithium acetate method (5). The final transformation mixture was plated on SD plates that lacked L-tryptophan, Lleucine, and L-histidine but that contained 25mM 3-aminotriazole. The obtained His/ transformants were subjected to b-galactosidase assay as a second screening. To examine the interaction of the Gpr1p with Gpa2p precisely, a series of pAS2-1/truncated-GPR1 and pACT2/GPA2 fusion proteins expression vectors were constructed as follows (Fig.3). A pACT2/4CC was obtained from two-hybrid screening which contains 4.5kb of Sau3AI fragment ligated in-frame to express C-terminal end (831961aa.) of GPR1 as a fusion protein. The 2kb of Nco I-Eco RI fragment of pACT2/4C-C was subcloned into Nco I-Eco RI site of pAS2-1 to construct pAS2-1/4C-C. A 0.55kb of Eco NI and Sma I fragment of pUC119/GPR1 was blunted and subcloned into Sma I site of pAS2-1 in-frame to construct pAS2-1/4C-N which express C-terminal region lacking C-terminal end of GPR1(679-862aa.) as a fusion protein. A pUC119/GPR1 was digested with Eco NI and blunted, then digested with Pst I. The 1.2kb of obtained fragment was ligated into Sma IPst I site of pAS2-1 in frame to construct pAS2-1/4C which express long C-terminal region (679-961aa.) of GPR1. A 1kb of Dra I-Sal I fragment of GPR1 was subcloned into Sma I-Sal I site of pAS2-1 and this construct was digested with Sal I and Pst I followed by partial deletion using deletion kit (TAKARA Shuzo. Co.) and selfligated. Several deletion clones were subjected to DNA sequencing and one clone which express 3rd. cytosol domain (318-587aa.) of GPR1 was selected as pAS2-1/3C. A 2.9kb of Nde I and Eco RI fragment of pGEM-T/GPR1-Nde I was subcloned into Nde I and Eco RI site of pAS2-1 to construct pAS2-1/ORF which express whole ORF (1-961aa.) as a fusion protein. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and subjected to two-hybrid assay as described manufacture's protocol. To verify the interaction we switched cloning vectors by moving the inserts from pACT2 to pAS2-1 and vice versa, and repeated the two hybrid assay. Construction of gene disruption vectors. A pUC119/GPR1 carrying 3.8 kb Pst I fragment of GPR1 genomic clone was digested with Hpa I and Bst 1107I to remove 2.1kb of internal region of the GPR1 ORF and blunted and ligated with Leu2 or Ura3 cassette with both ends blunted. The resultant plasmids were digested with Pst I and transformed S. cerevisiae haploid strain SH4848 or SH4849 to construct GPR1::Leu2 allele or GPR1::Ura3 allele. The gene disruption alleles were identified by PCR and southern hybridization in all disruptants. Gene manipulation. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (6) using the Sequenase ver.2 (USB). The other procedures were performed according to Sambrook et al.(7). Construction of the Gpr1p-GFP fusion protein expression vector. An expression vector for Gpr1p-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein (8) was constructed as follows. The 0.77kb of Nhe I-Pst

RESULTS Cloning of GPR1 Gene To screen the proteins which are involved in the regulation of intracellular cAMP level, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic library was screened using the yeast two-hybrid system (4) with Gpa2p as a bait. Sixty one His/ clones obtained from 1 1 106 transformants were subjected to b-galactosidase assay and 3 of them were identified to be positive. DNA sequencing of the insert DNA fragment in pACT2 from three positive clones showed that the 4.5kb of identical Sau3AI fragment in which 3 -region of one ORF was ligated in-frame to GAL4 transcriptional activation domain. MIPS yeast genome data base search (11, 12) revealed that the cloned DNA fragment was located on the left arm of chromosome IV which encodes the C-terminal region (120 amino acids) of unknown gene (yeast protein data base ORF name:YDL035C). This gene encodes 961 amino acids with predicted 7 transmembrane regions and thought to be a G-protein coupled receptor and designated as GPR1 (G-protein coupled receptor) (Fig.1). The deduced amino acid sequence of GPR1 did not show strong sequence similarity with other proteins. The Gpr1p has an extremely large loop (273622aa.) between 5th and 6th transmembrane region and a long C-terminal region (679-961aa.), both of which are thought to be locate intra-cellular. In the large third cytosolic domain, there is an asparagine rich domain (471-587aa) found in many phosphorylation proteins. There are five potential phosphorylation sites by cAMP dependent protein kinase in the second, third intracellular loop and C-terminal region (9). There are also many serine and threonine residues at the C-terminal tail which is also found in mammalian

Disruption of the GPR1 Gene The GPR1 allele in haploid strains SH4848(a) and SH4849(a) which were isolated from W303 diploid strain were disrupted as described in Materials and Methods. The structure of disrupted allele, in which 2.1 kb of HpaI and Bst1107I fragment (/100 to /2231 nucleotides) was replaced by LEU2 or URA3 cassette was shown in Fig.2. The disruptants were viable and

we concluded the GPR1 gene is not essential for the growth of the yeast cells. Two Hybrid Analysis To examine the interaction of the Gpr1p with Gpa2p precisely, a series of truncated GPR1 fragments were subcloned into pAS2-1 to construct the expression vectors for fusion proteins of the GAL4 DNA binding domain and Gpr1p fragments (Fig.3). The S. cerevisiae Y190 cells were cotransformed with each pAS2-1/truncated-GPR1 vectors and pACT2/ GPA2 followed by two-hybrid analysis (Fig.3). The pAS2-1/4C-C contains the same DNA fragment ob-

tained from two-hybrid screening which express Cterminal end (831-961aa.) of GPR1. The S. cerevisiae with pAS2-1/4C-C grew on selection medium and showed strongest signal on b-galactosidase filter assay (Fig.3). The pAS2-1/4C-N express C-terminal region lacking C-terminal end (679-862aa.) of GPR1. The S. cerevisiae with pAS2-1/4C-N neither grew on selection plate nor showed any signals on b-galactosidase assay (Fig.3). Interestingly, the S. cerevisiae with pAS2-1/4C which express long C-terminal region (679-961aa.) of GPR1 did not show any signals even pAS2-1/4C contains the 4C-C region which strongly interacted with Gpa2p. These results indicate that in the 4C-N region, there is a domain which may inhibit the interaction between the C-terminal end (831-961aa.) and Gpa2p. S. cerevisiae cotransformed with pAS2-1/3C which express the 3rd. cytosolic domain (318-587aa.) of GPR1 and pACT2/GPA2 also grew on selection medium and showed a positive signal on filter assay of b-galactosidase (Fig.3). The cells with pAS2-1/ORF express whole ORF (1961aa.) of GPR1 did not grow on selection plate and did not show positive signals on b-galactosidase assay because of the seven transmembrane region which might disturb the nuclear localization of the fusion proteins which is necessary for two-hybrid assay. These results indicate that the Gpr1p interact with Gpa2p at the 3C and 4C-C region.

FIG. 4. Yeast strains expressing the GPR1::GFP fusion genes. SH4848 cells transformed with pGPR1-GFP/YEp were grown for 12h as described. Cells were harvested, washed, and examined for GFP fluorescence (Left) or Nomarski (Right), as described in Materials and Methods. (Bar Å 5mm.)

Distribution of Gpr1p-GFP in Living Yeast Cells The cells expressing Gpr1p-GFP fusion proteins were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Comparison of the fluorescence from the GFP fusion (Fig.4; Left) with that from the Nomarski (Fig.4; Right) showed that the Gpr1p-GFP was localized at cell surface indicating the Gpr1p may localized at plasma membrane. DISCUSSION The GPR1 gene encodes 961 amino acids with predicted 7 transmembrane regions and thought to be a Gprotein coupled receptor. The Gpr1p has an extremely large third cytosolic loop (350 amino acid residues) and a long C-terminal region (283 amino acid residues), and both of which interact with Gpa2p. The 4C-N domain (679-862aa.) in the C-terminal region (679-961aa.) shows an inhibitory effect to the interaction between the C-terminal end (831-961aa.) and Gpa2p. This might be because that the receptor can not interact

with Gpa2p by inhibitory effect of the 4C-N domain in the absence of the ligand binding. And after the ligand binding, the conformational change of the receptor may permit the C-terminal region to interact with Gpa2p to transduce signal. The five potential phosphorylation sites by cAMP dependent protein kinase found in the second, third intracellular loop and C-terminal region may be involved in desensitization by phosphorylation. The serine and threonine rich domain found in the C-terminal end is also involved in the desensitization found in Gs coupled receptors as b2-adrenaline and D1-dopamine receptor as the phosphorylation sites by receptor kinase (10). Very recently, it was suggested that the Gpa2p positively regulates the intracellular cAMP levels through a new pathway parallel to the Ras2p pathway which is also involved in pseudohyphal development (2). In that paper it was shown that the disruption of GPA2 was not lethal but affected to the pseudohyphal development. Since Gpr1p interacted with Gpa2p at two regions of the third cytosolic loop as well as C-terminal

end and the gene disruption of GPR1 was not lethal and did not affect to the cell growth, it is quite possible that GPR1 gene disruption might affect to the pseudohyphal development which is involved in the new pathway via Gpa2p. To obtain more evidence for the functional coupling between Gpr1p and Gpa2p, further study is necessary. The result from fluorescence microscopic analysis that Gpr1p-GFP fusion protein localize at the plasma membrane also suggests that the Gpr1p plays a role at cell surface. Thus, it is likely that a Gpr1p monitors the extracellular signal such as nutrition and transduce it via Gpa2p to positively regulate the intracellular cAMP level. It has not yet been shown if the Gpa2p also localize at cell surface. Since GPA2 encodes a potential transmembrane region (308-324 aa.), the Gpa2p might co-localize with the Gpr1p at the plasma membrane. Identification of signals for Gpr1p must await further investigation. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
