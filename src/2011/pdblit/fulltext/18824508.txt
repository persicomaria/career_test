Abstract The protein kinase CK2 (former name: ``casein kinase 2'') predominantly occurs as a heterotetrameric holoenzyme composed of two catalytic chains (CK2a) and two noncatalytic subunits (CK2b). The CK2b subunits form a stable dimer to which the CK2a monomers are attached independently. In contrast to the cyclins in the case of the cyclin-dependent kinases CK2b is no on-switch of CK2a; rather the formation of the CK2 holoenzyme is accompanied with an overall change of the enzyme's profile including a modulation of the substrate specificity, an increase of the thermostability, and an allocation of docking sites for membranes and other proteins. In this study we used C-terminal deletion variants of human CK2a and CK2b that were enzymologically fully competent and in particular able to form a heterotetrameric holoenzyme. With differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) we confirmed the strong thermostabilization effect of CK2a on CK2b with an upshift of the CK2a melting temperature of more than 9°. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) we measured a dissociation constant of 12.6 nM. This high affinity between CK2a and CK2b is mainly caused by enthalpic rather than entropic ° contributions. Finally, we determined a crystal structure of the CK2b construct to 2.8 A resolution and revealed by structural comparisons with the CK2 holoenzyme structure that the CK2b conformation is largely conserved upon association with CK2a, whereas the latter undergoes significant structural adaptations of its backbone.

(Jones and Thornton 1996), or as a challenge for theoretical prediction (Lensink et al. 2007). The Ser/Thr protein kinase CK2 (former name: ``casein kinase 2'') provides a prime example of a physiologically relevant protein­protein interaction. In vertebrates, CK2 predominantly occurs as a heterotetrameric holoenzyme, i.e., as a complex of two catalytic subunits (CK2a) attached to a stable central dimer of two noncatalytic subunits (CK2b) (Niefind et al. 2001). CK2a is a close relative of the cyclin-dependent kinases and the MAP kinases. It is catalytically active already as a monomer,

but the association with CK2b significantly changes its enzymological properties, e.g., its substrate specificity (Pinna 2003), its ability to dock to membranes (Sarrouilhe et al. 1998), or even to penetrate them (Rodriguez et al. 2008). Moreover, CK2a-independent roles for CK2b have been suggested (Bibby and Litchfield 2005; BolanosGarcia et al. 2006). However, the recruitment of CK2a for the CK2 holoenzyme complex is so far the only validated function. Therefore, the lack of the modulatory impact of CK2b on CK2a may be the reason for the nonviability of CK2b knockout mice (Buchou et al. 2003). To test this hypothesis and to reveal more details of the physiological role of the CK2a/CK2b interaction, small molecule antagonists of CK2b are desirable. First attempts to develop such substances have been published recently (Laudet et al. 2007; Raaf et al. 2008). These efforts can be supported by structural and biophysical insights about the CK2a/CK2b interaction. Therefore, we present here the first unbound threedimensional (3D) structure of a CK2b construct that is fully capable of CK2a recruitment and we quantify its affinity to CK2a thermodynamically. This structure supplements existing structures of unbound human CK2a (Ermakova et al. 2003; Niefind et al. 2007; Raaf et al. 2008) and of the ``bound case,'' i.e., the human CK2 holoenzyme (Niefind et al. 2001); thus, it allows a comprehensive view on the conformational changes that occur at the CK2a/CK2b interface upon association. Results and Discussion Thermodynamic background For our analysis we used hsCK2b1­193, a C-terminally truncated mutant of human CK2b, in order to avoid aggregation problems as reported for the 215-aminoacids-long wild-type protein (Chantalat et al. 1999b). HsCK2b1­193 was among a set of 21 CK2b mutants characterized by Boldyreff et al. (1993). This study demonstrated that the ability of CK2b to bind CK2a critically depends on the C-terminal segment: While hsCK2b1­180 retained this competence only to a significantly reduced amount, hsCK2b1­193 was the shortest construct to be similarly functional as the wild type. In other words, the CK2b segment from Asn181 to His193 is a key region for the formation of the CK2 holoenzyme. We confirmed these results as far as they refer to hsCK2b1­193 with micro-calorimetric methods. First, we used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to determine the melting temperatures of hsCK2b1­193, of hsCK2a1­335--a fully active C-terminal deletion mutant of human CK2a (Ermakova et al. 2003)--and of a tetrameric complex of both. The resulting temperature scans (Fig. 1A) demonstrate that the melting point of hsCK2b1­193 changes only marginally

by complex formation, while that of hsCK2a1­335 increases from 45.6°C to 54.7°C. This strong thermostabilizing impact of hsCK2b1­193 on hsCK2a1­335 is fully consistent with former results obtained with the wild-type proteins using circular dichroism spectroscopy (Issinger et al. 1992), and it demonstrates a high affinity between both proteins. To quantify this affinity we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Fig. 1B). Assuming that a hsCK2b1­193 dimer possesses two equivalent binding sites for hsCK2a1­335, we determined a dissociation constant of 12.6 nM at 35°C. This value falls in a range typically reported for transient heterocomplexes (Nooren and Thornton 2003). It is in the same order of magnitude as the Kd value of 5.4 nM, measured for the interaction of full-length CK2b with a CK2a/gluthation-S-transferase fusion protein using surface plasmon resonance (Martel et al. 2002). This equivalence demonstrates that the final 22 amino acids of human CK2b contribute only marginally to the affinity to CK2a. Remarkably, the association of hsCK2a1­335 and hsCK2b1­193 is strongly exothermic. The standard free enthalpy DG° for the complex formation amounts to À46.6 kJ/mol and stems exclusively from the enthalpic term (DH° ¼ À49.0 kJ/mol), while the entropic contribution (ÀT*DS° ¼ +2.4 kJ/mol) slightly disfavors the binding (Fig. 1B). This result is surprising since, according to the CK2 holoenzyme structure (Niefind et al. 2001), the critical patch on the CK2a surface--which is located at the outer surface of the b-sheet typical for the N-terminal domain of eukaryotic protein kinases (indicated in Fig. 2A)--is characterized by a cluster of hydrophobic side chains (Fig. 1C). Therefore, one would expect the formation of hydrophobic interactions between the subunits, a release of ordered water molecules, and correspondingly, a significantly positive entropic term. A structural comparison of bound and unbound human CK2a suggests a possible explanation of this paradox. In all unbound structures (Ermakova et al. 2003; Niefind et al. 2007; Raaf et al. 2008) the just mentioned surface patch is not directly accessible for CK2b; rather the neighboring b4b5-loop occurs in a closed and CK2b incompatible conformation (see two representative examples in Fig. 1C). In this state the hydrophobic patch is reduced to a cavity that at best can harbor flat-shaped small molecules (Raaf et al. 2008). As a consequence unbound human CK2a cannot release a major amount of ordered water molecules during CK2b association. Only when CK2b binds, the b4b5-loop adopts an open conformation as it is found in the case of human CK2a so far exclusively in both CK2a chains of the CK2 holoenzyme (Fig. 1C; Niefind et al. 2001). Possibly this open state of human CK2a is energetically more relaxed than the unbound one with the closed b4b5-loop, meaning that the conformational change of CK2a is a potential source

of the heat released upon complex formation (Fig. 1B). This notion is currently speculative but it fits conspicuously to the observation that CK2a from Zea mays has an open b4b5-loop in nearly all of its crystal structures (Niefind et al. 1998), and simultaneously a significantly higher tendency to exist in vivo in a monomeric (unbound) state than its orthologs from higher animals (Dobrowolska et al. 1992). Further structures together with site-directed mutagenesis and ITC data are required to decide whether the b4b5-loop really plays a key role in the context of the CK2 holoenzyme formation. 2182

Crystal structure of hsCK2b1­193 Does CK2b--similar to CK2a--change its conformation at the interface region upon CK2 holoenzyme formation? So far this question could not be answered, since for CK2b no true unbound case structure existed. Rather the only available structures of free CK2b dimers (Chantalat et al. 1999a; Bertrand et al. 2004) were obtained with Cterminal deletion mutants without the aforementioned key region from Asn181 to His193, so that they miss the ability to form a CK2 holoenzyme. To close this gap we

Each hsCK2b1­193 monomer consists of a body comprising two domains (subunit A: blue/red; subunit B: green/yellow) and a C-terminal tail. The b-sheets of the N-terminal CK2a domains of the CK2 holoenzyme structure (Niefind et al. 2001) were drawn as black Ca traces after structural superimposition to indicate the location of the CK2a/CK2b interface. Two sulfate ions found at the juxta-dimer interface region are covered with FoFcomit density (cutoff level 3 s above the mean).

The purple dotted lines indicate hydrogen bonds; distances are given in angstroms. For comparison the backbone of the equivalent region of the CK2 holoenzyme together with some side chains are drawn in black. The figure was prepared with BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf 1997) and Raster3D (Merrit and Bacon 1997). (C) Stereo picture of the anion binding sites at the juxta-dimer interface region. The sites are occupied by sulfate ions in the hsCK2b1­193 structure, by phosphate ions (black) in the CK2 holoenzyme structure (Niefind et al. 2001), and by negatively charged side chains from a crystallographic neighbor (ball-and-stick representation of reduced size) in one of four dimers per asymmetric unit of the CK2b2­182 structure (Bertrand et al. 2004).

crystallized hsCK2b1­193 and determined its structure to ° 2.8 A resolution (Table 1). The asymmetric unit of the crystals contains two hsCK2b1­193 chains that are arranged as a dimer via a zinc-stabilized interface as described for the first time for human CK2b1­182 (Fig. 2A; Chantalat et al. 1999a). Similar to previously published CK2b structures (Chantalat et al. 1999a; Bertrand et al. 2004) the N-terminal segment (residues Met1 to Glu5) and parts of the so-called ``acidic loop'' (Fig. 2A; residues Glu60 to Asp64) are flexible and undefined by electron density. Like CK2a-bound CK2b within the CK2 holoenzyme (Niefind et al. 2001), each CK2b monomer consists of a ``CK2b body'' (Glu6­Ala180) composed of two folding domains and a ``CK2b tail'' (remaining C-terminal segment) (Fig. 2A). This tail is well defined by electron density up to the C terminus of the construct (His193; Fig. 2B). The CK2b tail of each monomer makes no contact to its own CK2b body; rather it crosses the dimer interface and is closely attached to the body of the second chain (Fig. 2A). Together with helix aF (and some smaller parts) of that body it forms the surface patch that can recruit a CK2a chain (Fig. 2A). A remarkable detail of the hsCK2b1­193 structure is two sulfate ions bound at the so-called juxta-dimer inter-

face region (Fig. 2A), whose function as a preferred anchor for several other proteins has been predicted bioinformatically (Bolanos-Garcia et al. 2006). Conspicuously, the CK2b dimer within the CK2 holoenzyme structure (Niefind et al. 2001) contains phosphate ions at very similar locations (Fig. 2C). Finally, in the CK2b2­182 structure published by Bertrand et al. (2004), one of a total of four CK2b2­182 dimers per asymmetric unit uses the equivalent positively charged surface patch to coordinate acidic side chains from a crystallographic neighbor (Fig. 2C). This coincidence reveals an anion binding capability of the juxta-dimer interface region that may in fact be utilized by some of the many interaction partners of CK2b (Bibby and Litchfield 2005). The CK2b conformation is preformed for CK2 holoenzyme formation To check the adaptability of CK2b at the interface region to CK2a we fitted the hsCK2b1­193 dimer structure on the CK2b dimer of the CK2 holoenzyme. For this purpose we used the LSQ_improve subroutine of the program O (Jones et al. 1991) that optimizes an initial least-squares fit of equivalent Ca atoms by iterative inclusion of more residues. The result of this fit was an RMS deviation of ° 1.1 A for 361 Ca atoms which are 98.6% of the ordered residues. The only deviations occur in the flexible acidic loop regions, while the tail zones from Asn181 to His193 match well to each other as well as the helices aF, which also contribute to CK2a binding. These results together with the structural overlay in Figure 2B demonstrate the preformed character of the CK2b dimers, which contrasts strongly with the aforementioned adaptability of CK2a in the contact region (Fig. 1C). At least up to Ile192 (Fig. 2B) no significant backbone adaptations occur in CK2b as a consequence of or as a condition for CK2a binding. Like in the CK2b dimer of the holoenzyme the final section of hsCK2b1­193 forms a small two-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (b-strands 4 and 5) with Tyr188 at the tip of the connecting loop (Fig. 2A,B); however, due to the higher resolution the b-strand geometry is better defined here than in the CK2 holoenzyme structure. The only distinct conformational changes in that region refer to the C-terminal His193 and to the side chain of Phe190 (Fig. 2B). In the case of His193, this is probably a crystal packing artifact, since this residue additionally has different (but well defined) conformations in the two hsCK2b1­193 monomers. Phe190, however, is known as one of the ``hot spots'' of the CK2a/CK2b interaction from the CK2 holoenzyme structure (Niefind et al. 2001) and from a recent kinetic and site-directed mutagenesis study (Laudet et al. 2007). This crucial role of Phe190 fits nicely to the change of its side-chain rotamer after CK2a attachment, illustrated in Figure 2B.

Taken together, while CK2a undergoes large conformational changes in the contact region upon docking, the critical part of CK2b is preformed. The reduced adaptability of CK2b ensures specificity of its interactions with CK2a and possibly a few other protein kinases (Bibby and Litchfield 2005); moreover, it increases the prospects of theoretical docking calculations with the hsCK2b1­193 structure and the chance to develop CK2b antagonists of high selectivity. Materials and Methods Protein expression and purification
HsCK2a1­335 and hsCK2b1­193 were expressed recombinantly in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. To generate the CK2 holoenzyme, mixed lysates of the bacterial cells containing the expressed hsCK2a1­335 and hsCK2b1­193 proteins were incubated overnight at 4°C. The three proteins--hsCK2a1­335, hsCK2b1­193, and the holoenzyme (hsCK2a1­335)2(hsCK2b1­193)2-- were purified with a two-step chromatographic procedure. The first purification step in all three cases was a phosphocellulose chromatography. The column was equilibrated with 300 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. After protein application and washing, a gradient elution was performed using 1 M NaCl, 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, as a high-salt component. The second step for hsCK2b1­193 was an anion exchange chromatography with a HiTrap Sepharose Q column (GE HealthCare). The equilibration and low-salt solution of the gradient was 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, and the high-salt component was again 1 M NaCl, 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. For hsCK2a1­335 and the holoenzyme, the second purification step was affinity chromatography with a HiTrap Heparin HP column (GE HealthCare). The equilibration and low-salt solution of the gradient was 400 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, and the high-salt component was 1 M NaCl, 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. Finally, the proteins were concentrated and rebuffered in 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5 by ultrafiltration using AMICON Ultra-15 tubes.

ment consisted of 25 injections of 10 mL. The injections were made over a period of 20 s with a 300-s interval between subsequent injections. The raw ITC data (Fig. 1B, upper panel) were processed with ORIGIN software (version 7), Origin Lab, assuming a binding model of a single set of two equivalent sites (meaning two hsCK2a1­335 ligands bind to one hsCK2b1­193 dimer). The final values (inset of Fig. 1B) are averages of three repetitions.

Crystallization
All crystallization experiments with hsCK2b1­193 were performed at 20°C with the vapor diffusion technique. The optimized crystallization condition was 0.17 M ammonium sulfate, 0.085 M sodium cacodylate, pH 6.3, 25.5% w/v PEG 8000, and 15% v/v glycerol for the reservoir. The crystallization drop contained 2 mL of a hsCK2b1­193 solution (6.6 mg/mL) and 3 mL reservoir. The crystals were directly transferred from the mother liquor to liquid nitrogen for cryo-protection.

Diffraction data collection and structure determination
X-ray diffraction data (Table 1) were collected at a temperature of 100 K at the beamline X12 of the EMBL outstation in ° Hamburg. The wavelength was 0.9 A. All diffraction data were processed with the HKL package (Otwinowski and Minor 1997). The structure of hsCK2b1­193 was determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 1994) and refined with REFMAC (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 1994). Manual corrections were performed with O (Jones et al. 1991). The structure was validated with PROCHECK (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 1994).

Protein Data Bank Deposition
The final atomic coordinates and structure factor amplitudes of hsCK2b1­193 are available from the PDB (accession code 3EED).

Acknowledgments DSC measurements
For DSC data collection we used a VP-DSC differential scanning calorimeter. For each of the three proteins three temperature scans were performed from 20°C to 80°C at a scan rate of 25°C/h. The protein concentrations varied between 64 to 96 mM for hsCK2a1­335, between 30 and 69 mM for hsCK2b1­193, and between 30 and 68 mM for the holoenzyme (hsCK2a1­335)2 (hsCK2b1­193)2. In all cases the protein buffer was 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5. Processing of the raw data was performed with ORIGIN software (version 7), Origin Lab.
