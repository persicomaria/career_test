The crystal structure of FMN-binding protein (FMN-bp) from Desulfovibrio vulgaris Miyazaki F was solved by the multiple isomorphous replacement method and re®ned to an R factor of Ê 15.1% at 1.3 A resolution. FMN-bp exists in a dimeric form in the crystal, in contrast to the monomeric structure determined by NMR. R.m.s. deviations between the crystal structure and the solution Ê structure are more than 2 A, which implies signi®cant differences. There are some hydrophobic residues in the interface between the two monomers. In particular, Leu122 in the C-terminus has a close contact with the o-xylene moiety of FMN, while solvent molecules may cover the o-xylene moiety in the solution structure.

1. Introduction
FMN-bp is composed of 122 amino acids and is the smallest of the known proteins which bind FMN (Kitamura et al., 1994). The function of FMN-bp in vivo is still unclear, but it may take part in the electron-transfer pathway. A structural study of FMN-bp as a monomer in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has previously been reported (Liepinsh et al., 1997, 1998). It is suggested that FMN-bp has a structural relationship to the C-terminal domain of chymotrypsin. Subsequently, another possibility was noticed: a structural relationship between FMN-bp and the FAD-binding domain of ferredoxin reductase (Murzin, 1998). We have carried out an X-ray structure analysis at rather high resolution with synchrotron radiation and have found the molecule to exist in the dimeric form. Here, we mainly report the differences between the crystal structure and the solution structure.

2. Experimental and structure determination
FMN-bp was puri®ed as described previously (Kitamura et al., 1994). The protein solution subjected to crystallization contained 15 mg mlÀ1 FMN-bp, 0.1 M Tris±HCl pH 8.0 and 200 mM sodium chloride, in which FMN-bp is oxidized. Single crystals were grown using polyethylene glycol by the vapordiffusion method with the micro-seeding technique. The reservoir contained 0.1 M buffer solution (MES pH 6.5 or Tris±HCl pH 7.5), 20%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 or

8000, 0.2 M sodium acetate and 20% glycerol (Suto et al., 1999). The diffraction intensity data of native crystals were collected using synchrotron radiation at beamlines BL-6A and BL-18B at the Photon Factory, KEK, Japan (Table 1). The programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) were used for data processing. For the individual data sets, the overall Rmerge was in the range 2.6±4.8% and Rmerge for the highest shell was less than 20% with I ! '(I). All crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P21, with unit-cell parameters a = 37.22 (3), b = 84.59 (5), Ê c = 41.10 (2) A,  = 94.07 (5) . Assuming that two molecules are present in the asymmetric unit, their Vm values are within the range Ê 2.35±2.36 A3 DaÀ1, which is reasonable for protein crystals. Although molecular replacement using X-PLOR was attempted with the structures obtained by NMR methods, no likely solutions were found. Consequently, the structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement. Three derivatives were prepared. Crystals were soaked in solutions containing K2PtCl6, K2IrCl6 or UO2(NO3)2. The data from the derivative soaked in K2PtCl6 solution were collected using synchrotron radiation at the BL-6A beamline and the data from the other derivatives were collected using Cu K X-rays on a MacScience DIP3000 imaging plate. The data processing was carried out in a similar way to that used for the native data. Heavy-atom positions were determined by difference Patterson map from native 1 using XTALVIEW (McRee, 1993). Phase calculation and re®nement of heavy-atom positions were carried out using MLPHARE (Collaborative

Computational Project, Number 4, 1994), followed by solvent ¯attening and histogram mapping using DM (Cowtan, 1994). Some parts of molecules could be located in the electrondensity map. A non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) matrix was calculated from the partial model, because NCS could not be de®ned clearly from the self-rotation function È using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1993) and CCP4. The whole model was built after the map had been improved with successive solvent ¯attening, histogram mapping and NCS averaging. Re®nement was carried out using X-PLOR against native 1 with NCS restraints to the resoÊ lution limit 2.0 A and using SHELX97 (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997) against native 2 Ê to 1.30 A. The ®nal Rwork was 15.0% and Rfree was 18.2% for native 2 in the resolution range Ê 8.0±1.30 A. The Ramachandran plot of FMN-bp shows that the percentage of residues with (9, 2) conformational angles in the most favoured region is 93.1% (188 residues) and that all remaining residues (6.9%, 14 residues) are in additional allowed regions. The four terminal residues, ten proline and 28 glycine residues were excluded from these calculations. R.m.s. deviations and distances were calculated using X-PLOR and LSQKAB (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Figures were drawn using MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) and RASTER3D (Merrit &

There are two FMN-bp molecules in the asymmetric unit. They are related by a noncrystallographic twofold axis and are considered to form a dimer as shown in Fig. 1(a). We designate the two molecules as molecule A and molecule B; the amino-acid residues or cofactors belonging to each molecule are distinguished with superscripts (for example, APhe104) when necessary. The r.m.s. deviation of main-chain atoms between the two molecules is no more than Ê Ê 0.16 A with an average B factor of 14.4 A2, which indicates that the two molecules are almost identical. The secondary structure consists of seven -strands, three -helices and a short 310 helix as follows: residues 1±215(1), 26±32 (2a), 37±39 (2b), 43±48 (3), 63±74 (4), 79±92 (5), 109±120(6), 4±10 (1), 34±35 (310), 52±60 (2), 96±99 (3). In addition, two turns and a loop are assigned as follows: residues 22±25 (T1), 39±42 (T2) and 75±78 (L3). The molecular interface is ¯at and mainly hydrophobic (see Fig. 1b); Ala17, Ala19, Pro26, Leu28, Leu65 and Leu84 take part in the association of the two monomers. In addition, many hydrogen bonds are formed in the peripheral part of the interface. A Glu21 O4 is bonded to BGln21 N4, A Asn30 N is bonded to AThr67 O and the two AArg63 NH2 atoms are bonded to B Asp24 O, where molecules A and B can interchange. Thus, the association of the two molecules into the dimer involves hydrophobic interactions in the central part as well as the hydrophilic interactions surrounding them. The contacting area seems to be signi®cantly broad. The accessible surface area of an FMN-bp monomer is Ê calculated to be 6500 A2 per molecule. In the case of the dimer, the accessible surface Ê area is 10 200 A2. Therefore, an area of Ê 2 is lost on dimerization. The mole1400 A cular weight was estimated to be 17 500 Da by the gel-®ltration method; this was higher than that calculated for the monomer (Kitamura et al., 1994). This suggests that FMN-bp at least partially exists as a dimer in solution. The cofactor FMN is situated in the groove near the interface and is held in place by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions (Fig. 2a). The numbering scheme in the FMN molecule is the same as

ribityl phosphate moiety is held in place by hydrogen bonds to the side-chain atoms of His27 and Thr54, the main-chain atoms of Lys53 and Thr54, and three water molecules. The atoms in the 2,4-pyrimidinedione (uracil) moiety are bound tightly by hydrogen bonds to surrounding residues; for example, the O(2) atom to the main-chain N atoms of Gly49 and Gly50, the N(3) atom to the main-chain O atom of Pro47 and the O(4) atom to Thr31 O1 with a distance of Ê 2.78 A. The N(1) atom of the 2,4-pyrimidinedione moiety forms a hydrogen bond with the O(4)* atom of the ribityl side chain in FMN. An o-xylene moiety of FMN is located near Trp32 and Val115. It is noteworthy that Leu122 in the pairing molecule also shows hydrophobic interactions. These three residues contacting the o-xylene moiety form a hydrophobic core. The loop Gly75± Pro79 seems to cover this hydrophobic core. At the back of the 2,4-pyrimidinedione moiety of FMN, the side chain of Met51 runs parallel with the ribityl side chain towards the 2,4-pyrimidinedione moiety, in contrast to the case in most ¯avoproteins, where the methionine side chain is found below the o-xylene moiety. This difference suggests that Met51 is indispensable for the activity of FMN-bp and might be responsible for the difference in redox potential between FMN-bp and other ¯avoproteins (Druhan & Swenson, 1998). In the crystal structure, FMN lies at the bottom of the hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 2b). It is interesting to note that there are some exposed aromatic residues at the back of the pocket. Tyr35, Trp106 and Phe104 are exposed to the solvent regions and may participate in the electron transfer. Tyr35 and Phe104 are located within interacting Figure 2 distance.

3.2. Comparison of the crystal structure with the solution structure

The most remarkable feature of the X-ray structure is that FMN-bp forms a dimer, in contrast to the structure deduced from NMR spectroscopy in which there was no consideration of the possibility of a dimeric form. 20 sets of coordinates of the NMR structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 1axj (Liepinsh et al., 1997, 1998). The r.m.s. deviation of main-chain atoms in each structure from the Ê average structure is no more than 0.54 A, which is low considering the number of residues (Fig. 3a). On the other hand, the r.m.s. deviation of the main-chain atoms of the X-ray structure from the average NMR Ê structure is as much as 2 A, which suggests signi®cant discrepancies are observed between the two structures. The deviations between corresponding atoms in the main chains of the two structures are also plotted against the amino-acid sequence. The monomeric NMR structure is superimposed on the dimeric X-ray structure in Fig. 3(b). It is clear that the conformations of the residues around Asn77, forming L3, have the most remarkable differences. A large discrepancy between the X-ray and NMR structures is also observed in the vicinity of the C-terminal region and is compared in Fig. 3(c). In the X-ray structure, as described before, ALeu122 is located near the o-xylene moiety of BFMN. This hydrophobic part is covered by the reverse turn formed by residues AGly75, AArg76, AAsn77 and A Gly78. In contrast, the hydrophobic side chain of Leu122 is buried under the hydrogen-bond network among the side chains of AArg76, AAsn77 and the mainchain atoms of ALeu122, AGly80 etc. in the NMR structure. This discrepancy might arise from the fact that FMN-bp forms a dimer in the crystal, whereas it is postulated to exist as a monomer in solution where the NMR experiment was carried out. As described, the o-xylene moiety of FMN interacts with Leu122 of the pairing molecule and is therefore not exposed to solvent in the X-ray structure. The solventaccessible surface area of FMN calculated for the dimeric form is 13%, in agreement with other ¯avoproteins, although it was 34% for the NMR structure. The lower accessibility of FMN in the crystal seems to be natural, as a rather low dissociation constant of 0.43 nM (unpublished data) is observed. In addition, the hydrophobicity around FMN, particularly around the o-xylene moiety, seems to play an important role in the oxidative and reductive behaActa Cryst. (2000). D56, 368±371

viour of FMN (Druhan & Swenson, 1998). The second and third largest differences are found at 2 and T1. The difference in the location of 1 could not be accounted for. The structure of T1 is quite reasonable and it occupies an appropriate location, whereas the NMR structure could not form a stable dimeric form because the T1 part would be in contact within the van der Waals radius (Fig. 3b). Both differences are also concurrent with dimerization. As the other -strands and helices have a small decrease in their angles, the distances between the models become larger in all loops and turns. In this case, the rigid structure of FMN-bp is easily changed by hydrophobic interactions at two cores and the direction of the C-terminal residue. We would like to thank Drs N. Sakabe, N.
