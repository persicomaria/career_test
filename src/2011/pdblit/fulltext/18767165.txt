ABSTRACT In this article, we report crystal structures for inhibitor-kinase complexes in which the inhibitor has different binding orientations and hydrogen-bonding patterns with extracellular-signal regulated kinase 2 and insulin receptor tyrosine kinase. Our crystallographic studies, and sequence and structural analyses of 532 coordinates of kinases held in the Protein Data Bank, suggest that the length of the ``specificity linker'' described here is a key structural element of the hydrogen-bonding patterns between protein kinases and their inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION Recent genomic and proteomic studies have identified more than 500 protein kinases (PKs) encoded in the human genome, which constitute one of the largest known protein families.1 Many PKs function by activating one another via ATP-dependent phosphorylation of serine, threonine, or tyrosine hydroxyl residues on their oxygen atoms. These phosphorylation cascades regulate diverse cellular events and control many different biological functions within the human body. Therefore, compounds that inhibit the activation of specific PKs that are recognized as therapeutic targets can be useful drugs.2­5 The mode of ATP binding is believed to be conserved among all kinases. The adenine moiety of ATP is bound by two hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl and amide groups of two nonconsecutive residues, R1 and R3, in the hinge region [Fig. 1(a)]. The N1 and N6 amino groups of the adenine moiety form hydrogen bonds with the main-chain oxygen on R1 (R1-O) and the main-chain nitrogen on R3 (R3-N), respectively. Adenine mimetics, such as quinazoline, indolinone, and pyrrolopyrimidine, act as scaffolds for synthesizing PK inhibitors and have adjacent donor and acceptor sites that are similar to those in ATP. However, the hydrogen bonds that are formed with PKs by inhibitors based on these scaffolds differ from those that are formed by the adenine moiety of ATP; for example, Purvalanol B [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1CKP] and NU2058 (PDB code 1E1V) form hydrogen bonds with main-chain oxygen on R3 (R3-O) and R3-N of CDK2 [Fig. 1(b,c)]. As hydrogen bonding is recognized as a crucial factor in determining the binding of PK inhibitors that act as competitive inhibitors of ATP, predicting hydrogen-bonding patterns between scaffolds and the linker regions of target PKs is essential for effective structure-based drug design. Here, we report the crystal structures of one PK inhibitor in complex with two PKs, extracellular-signal regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (IRK). This PK inhibitor was found to have opposite binding orientations with differ-

ent hydrogen-bonding patterns in each kinase. This seemed to result from the difference in the length of the loop between the hinge region and the aD helix. This mechanism for the control of the hydrogen-bonding pattern of a ligand can be extrapolated to most of the PKs with structures deposited in the PDB. MATERIALS AND METHODS

Crystallization of human IRK

The expression and purification of phosphorylated human IRK were carried out as described previously with minor modifications.7 IRK crystals were grown at 48C using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. The reservoir solution was 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2M sodium formate, and 0.1M HEPES (pH 7.0). The hanging drop consisted of 2 lL of 5 mg/mL IRK protein, 2 lL of 1 mM compound 1, and an equal volume of reservoir solution. X-ray crystallographic data were collected with a Weissenberg camera on imaging plates (400 mm 3 800 mm) using synchrotron radiation by the BL-6B beam line at the Photon Factory of the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Japan. The data collection proceeded at room temperature, as the crystal is sensitive to changes in the physical property of the solvent. The completeness of the ° data up to 3.25 A was 96.3%.
Structure solution and refinement

posited in the PDB before June 2006. Among them, 367 complex structures were selected for analysis of the hydrogen-bonding pattern based on the following criteria: first, that any atom of the ligand makes a hydrogen bond with R1-O, R3-N, or R3-O; and second, that the molecular weight of the ligand is more than 100. It has been reported that hydrogen bonding between an aromatic CH and a carbonyl oxygen is not uncommon and can sometimes play an important role in the interaction between PKs and their inhibitor.8 Incorporation of this type of interaction into the docking score improve the accuracy of docking simulation.9 However, we did not include this type of interaction because it was difficult to estimate the relative importance of such a nonstandard hydrogen bond when compared with a traditional hydrogen bond. All manipulations, including the detection of hydrogen bonds, were carried out using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOETM) Version 2006.08 (Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada) with minor modifications.

The structures of the PK-inhibitor complexes were analyzed using the Patterson search method, based on models of free and active forms of ERK2 (PDB code 3ERK) and IRK (PDB code 1IR3). The structure of the inhibitor molecule was built using QUANTA software (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) and fitted to the electron-density map using the X-LIGAND module. The models were refined by alternating cycles of manual rebuilding using the X-BUILD module and simulated annealing using the CNX module (Accelrys). The final statistics for the refined models are summarized in Supplementary Table IV, and the electrondensity map around Compound 1 is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. The coordinates for the complexes described in the article have been deposited in the PDB (PDB codes 2Z7L and 2Z8C) for immediate release on publication.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Different binding modes of compound 1 complexed with ERK2 and IRK

The ability of Compound 1 to inhibit human IRK and ERK2 (purchased from UBI, Hauppauge, NY) was measured using fluorescence resonance-energy transfer assay kits (Z-Lyte, PanVera, Madison, WI), according to the PV3191 or PV3176 protocols recommended by the supplier. Assay solutions were prepared using the kinase buffers supplied in the kit, which contained 50 ng activated enzyme, 250 lM ATP, and 10 mM Mn for IRK, or 10 ng activated enzyme and 25 lM ATP for ERK2. Serial dilutions of Compound 1 were added to an assay tube in 1% DMSO as a final concentration. The fluorescence intensity was measured using a Safire microplate reader (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).
Analysis of PK coordinate data in the PDB

We searched for and selected 532 coordinates of PKs ° with a resolution value of 3.3 A or less that had been de-

In the course of optimizing novel kinase inhibitors, we identified [4-({5-carbamoyl-4-[(3-methylphenyl)amino]pyrimidin-2-yl}amino)phenyl]acetic acid (1) as an inhibitor of both ERK2 and IRK, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 750 and 2800 nM, respectively. Compound 1 was cocrystallized with ERK2 or IRK (crystallographic data and refinement statistics are available in Supplementary Table I). Our analysis revealed that binding of Compound 1 did not result in significant overall conformational changes in either ERK2 or IRK. Compound 1 consists of a carboxamide pyrimidine scaffold and two aniline-derived substituents. It was found to occupy the ATP-binding site in both kinase complexes, with the carboxamide pyrimidine moiety acting as an adenine mimetic and anchoring the compound to the hinge region by hydrogen bonds. Surprisingly, the hydrogen-bonding patterns were different in these two complexes [Fig. 2(a­c)]. In the complex with ERK2, the N1 and N2 amino groups on the scaffold formed hydrogen bonds with R3-N and R3-O, respectively (see Fig. 2 for details of the amino acids corresponding to R1, R2, and R3 in ERK2 and IRK). By contrast, in the complex with IRK, the N5 carboxamide moiety formed hydrogen bonds with R1-O and R3-N [Fig. 2(b)]. Consequently, the N2 substituent of Compound 1 occupied the same position in the complex with ERK2 as the N4 substituent in the complex with IRK and vice versa.

(c-Abl).10,11 This occurs because the ``DFG-in'' conformation of Syk cannot provide the secondary binding site accessed by Gleevec, as observed in the ``DFG-out'' conformation of c-Abl. This differs from the case of the binding of Compound 1 with ERK2 and IRK, in which the molecule occupies a similar portion of the ATP-binding site in both structures. As the two substituents of Compound 1 have the same aromatic features, and the carboxylate moiety shows no electrostatic interaction with either of the PKs, we suggest that the primary factor determining the mode of binding of the compound is not the interactions between the substituents and the PKs, but rather the interactions between the carboxyamide pyrimidine scaffold and the PKs. Structural comparisons of the complexes of Compound 1 with ERK2 and IRK revealed that R3-O in ERK2, but not in IRK, was oriented toward the center of the adenine pocket so that it could accept a hydrogen bond from the scaffold [Fig. 2(c)]. When ERK2 and IRK were superimposed with the backbone N-Ca-C atoms of R1-R3 [root mean square ° deviation (RMSD) 5 0.15A], R3-O was displaced by 0.9 ° in the two complexes. This difference was also characA terized by the F and C angles at the R3 residues, which were 21068 and 2788 for IRK and 2948 and 2178 for ERK2, respectively. Although the F angles at R3 in ERK2 and IRK were similar, the C angle at R3 in IRK was 608 greater than that in ERK2. Consequently, R1-O, R3-N, and R3-O were favorable for hydrogen bonding in ERK2, but R3-O was unfavorable in IRK.

To confirm whether this is a specific case for Compound 1, we determined another five complex structures of PK inhibitors with IRK and 10 complex structures of PK inhibitors with ERK2 (data not shown). The average values of the F and C angles at the R3 residues were 2102 Æ 128 and 286 Æ 78 for IRK and 294 Æ 128 and 227 Æ 158 for ERK2. The C angle at the R3 residue of IRK was larger than that of ERK2 by $608. Note that the C angles at the R3 residues of unliganded IRK were also larger than that of ERK2 by $508 (PDB code 5 1P14 for IRK and 1ERK for ERK2). Furthermore, eight out of the 10 PK inhibitors complexed with ERK2 made hydrogen bonds with R3-O, while none of the PK inhibitors complexed with IRK made hydrogen bonds with R3-O. These results indicated that the displacement of R3-O occurred in a ligand-independent manner and was responsible for the hydrogen-bonding pattern of PK inhibitors in IRK and ERK2. To investigate the mechanism of this displacement, we carried out sequence and structural analyses. The superposition of IRK and ERK2 coordinates indicated that the Ca atoms of the hinge region and the first residue of the aD helix (L110 in ERK2 and L1084 in IRK) overlapped well in these two PK structures. The Ca atoms of the hinge region should overlap well because R1-O and R3-N are hydrogen-bonded with the substrate ATP. It also stands to reason that the first residues of the aD helix were in the same position spatially because this residue was in a hydrogen-bonding network with the residues of b7 (C1138 in IRK and L153 in ERK2) and b8 (K1147 in

IRK and K162 in ERK2), which reinforced the inter-subdomain interactions among subdomains V, VIb, and VII, to form a part of the ATP-binding pocket (the definition of subdomains follows Hanks et al.12). By contrast, we found that the length of the peptide connecting the hinge region and the aD helix differed in the two PKs [Fig. 2(d)]. This region, which we referred to as the ``specificity linker'' because it contributed to the ``specificity surface,'' had three residues in ERK2 (E107-D109) and four residues in IRK (A1080-D1083). Consequently, it was likely that IRK and ERK2 were unable to adopt the same conformation at the specificity linker, because of the different lengths of residues in the same distance, which resulted in the displacement of the R3-O adjacent to the specificity linker.
Structural and sequence analysis of PKs deposited in the PDB

These observations of ERK2 and IRK led us to speculate that the length of the specificity linker, which affected the orientation of R3-O, was a key structural element of the hydrogen-bonding patterns of kinase­ligand complexes in general. To confirm this hypothesis, we classified the PKs deposited in the PDB according to the number of amino acid residues in their specificity linkers and analyzed the F and C angles at the R3 position (Supplementary Table II). Based on the sequence and structural alignment of the residues of the hinge region and the aD helix, we found that the majority of PKs had specificity linkers containing three or four amino acids. We therefore suggest that PKs can be classified into two groups on this basis: Group A, the member of which are kinases containing a specificity linker of three residues; and Group B, the member of which are kinases containing a specificity linker of four residues. Our proposal is novel and is not consistent with the widely recognized classification of PKs into two main subdivisions on the basis of substrate: protein-tyrosine kinases (TKs) and protein-serine/threonine kinases. The latter are further divided into subfamilies, such as the protein kinase A, G, and C (AGC) and the cyclin-dependent kinase, mitogenactivated protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3, and CDC-like kinase (CMGC) families. According to our new classification, all CMGCs, including ERK2, are members of Group A, whereas most AGCs and TKs, including IRK, are members of Group B. Fig. 3(a) shows the Ramachandran plot of R3 residues in the 532 crystal structures of PKs deposited in the PDB. The two groups of PKs, based on the length of their specificity linkers, are separated in this plot. There are several outliers at the top and bottom of the plot (C angle 5 >908 or < 21508) corresponding to some coordinates of p38,13 SRPK1-like kinase in yeast (Sky1P)14 and ERK2,15 the backbones of which are reported to be flipped at the hinge regions. This peptide flip can occur

The blue circles represent group A kinases with specificity linkers of three amino acids, and the red circles represent group B kinases with specificity linkers of four amino acids. The outliers at the top and bottom of the plot are p38, Sky1P, and ERK2. The cyan circles represent kinases with specificity linkers of five amino acids. (b) The plots represent 367 complex structures that are color-coded according to their hydrogen bond patterns. Yellow circles represent kinases that are hydrogen-bonded to ligands by the R3-O atom, which are distributed over a similar region to group A kinases. Green circles, showing a random distribution, represent kinases that do not use R3-O for hydrogen bonding.

when the next residue of R3 is a glycine due to the lower steric hindrance of the small side chain.13,14 ERK2, the corresponding residue of which is a glutamate, is an exceptional case, in which the unfavorable interaction between ERK2 and its inhibitor is avoided by this peptide flip.15 With the exception of these outliers, the average values of the C angles of R3 residues are 234 Æ 198 for 214 Group A kinase coordinates and 274 Æ 158 for 276 Group B kinase coordinates. These values are similar to those that we found for ERK2 and IRK, respectively, indicating that R3-O adopts one or the other orientation in Group A kinases and Group B kinases, as we characterized in ERK2 and IRK. Fig. 3(b) shows the Ramachandran plot of R3 residues for 367 kinase­ligand complex structures deposited in the PDB. In a large number of the complex structures analyzed in Group A without outliers (62%, 100 out of 162), R3-O is involved in hydrogen bonding with a ligand as well as R1-O and R3-N. Therefore, in Group A kinases, all three sites, R3-O, R1-O, and R3-N could potentially make hydrogen bonds with a ligand. By contrast, only in a small number of the complex structures analyzed in Group B (15%, 26 out of 178), R3-O is utilized in hydrogen bonding with PK inhibitors.

example, as for c-Abl, the average value of the C angles of R3 residues in the DFG-out conformation (PDB codes: 1FPU, 1IEP and 1OPJ) is 268.28 and that in the DFG-in conformation (PDB codes: 1M52, 1OPK, 2F4J, 2FO0, 2G1T, 2G2F, 2G2H, and 2G2I) is 271.28 (Supplementary Table II). Although some complex structures of c-Abl make hydrogen bonds with PK inhibitors by the R3-O atoms despite the specificity linker with four residues, this is not due to the difference in the conformation of the DFG-loop.
Reliabilities of the parameters in this work

Although we did not exclude medium-resolution structures deposited in the PDB, to ensure diversity of the PKs (see Materials and Methods section), we repeated the analysis with different resolution criteria and confirmed that the same tendencies were observed as those reported in this work (Supplementary Tables III and IV). CONCLUSIONS This report suggests that the number of the amino acids in the region, which we have defined as the specificity linker, is a key structural element of the hydrogenbonding pattern between PKs and their ligands (see Fig. 5). Although the length of the specificity linker alone does not determine the hydrogen-bonding pattern as mentioned earlier, it provides useful information for the prediction of the binding mode of the PK inhibitor. The specificity linker is located at the rim of the ATP-binding pocket of kinases. Crystallographic studies of PKs have shown that most PK inhibitors do not interact with the protein surface around the specificity linker. However,

The outliers referred to in the text (C angle 5 >908 or < 21508) are excluded from these plots. Yellow bars correspond to kinases that are hydrogenbonded to ligands by the R3-O atom. Green bars correspond to kinases that do not use R3-O for hydrogen bonding and are hydrogen-bonded to ligands by the R3-O atom.

Fig. 4 highlights the difference in the C angles of R3 residues and the hydrogen-bonding pattern between Group A kinases and Group B kinases shown in Fig. 3. All these data indicate a good correlation among the orientation of R3-O, the length of the specificity linker, and the hydrogen bonds formed between PKs and PK inhibitors. Although the orientation of R3-O in class B kinases is unfavorable for hydrogen bonding with PK inhibitors, it does not exclude the possibility of hydrogen bonding. Fifteen percent of class B kinases utilize R3-O in hydrogen bonding with PK inhibitors probably because of the contribution of the surrounding amino acids at binding site and/or chemical structures of PK inhibitors. It has been reported that several PKs adopt two different conformations: DFG-in and DFG-out.5 The orientations of R3-O are generally similar in both states. For

specific PK inhibitors have been shown to interact with this region such as SU5402 with the fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase 1.16 In such cases, the specificity linker is thought to be important not only for contributing to the hydrogen-bonding pattern indirectly but also for determining the specificity of kinase­ligand interactions.
