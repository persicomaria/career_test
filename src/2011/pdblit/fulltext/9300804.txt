The effect of charged amino acids on the active site chemistry of heme proteins is a subject W-68 Ku-61 of continuing interest.`s2 Although it is clear that _~ local electrostatics have a substantial influence on W-67 CT the redox chemistry and spectroscopic properties P PC of the heme group, the specific interactions responsible for these effects are not well understood. To investigate these effects, charged His-93 amino acids were introduced into the active site % of horse heart myoglobin (Mb) by site-directed mutagenesis. The hydrophobic residues Va167 c and V68, located within the distal heme pocket, histidine A&W Of Site HorSe MyO@Obh Har( and were replaced by arginine respectively (V67R and V68H), and S92, located adjacent to the proximal histidine ligand, was replaced by an aspartic acid residue (S92D). The E, of the V67R mutant was found to be 119.6 f 0.55 mV vs. NHE (pH 6.0,25"C, p = 0.10 M (NaCl)) compared to a value of 64.3 f 0.1 mV for wild type Mb. In addition, the pK,, for titration of the distal water molecule [Fe(III)-H,O + Fe(III)-OH- + H'] has been determined to be 8.0 for V67R, compared to 8.9 for wild-type metMb. For the S92D variant, the reduction potential was 98.7 f 1.0 mV vs. NHE (pH 6.0,25"C, u = 0.10 M (NaCl)), and the pKs, for the distal water molecule was 9.0. Examination of the electronic spectrum of the V67R and S92D variants has revealed features that differ substantially from that of wildtype Mb. For example, the spectrum of deoxyMb exhibits new absorption maxima at 625.5 nm for V67R Mb and 624.5 nm for S92D Mb that are not present in the spectrum of wild-type deoxyMb. The effect of the introduction of a histidine residue at position 68 is currently under investigation. (Supported by the Protein Engineering Network of Centres of Excellence.) 1. J. Eccles, B.
