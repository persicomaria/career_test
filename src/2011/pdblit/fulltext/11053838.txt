Crystallographic studies of the interaction between the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase and ferredoxin from the cyanobacterium Anabaena: looking for the elusive ferredoxin molecule
Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) and its physiological electron donor ferredoxin (Fd) from the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC7119 have been co-crystallized. The unit-cell Ê parameters are a = b = 63.72, c = 158.02 A and the space group Ê is P212121. The crystal structure has been solved with 2.4 A resolution synchrotron data by molecular replacement, anomalous dispersion and Rmin search methods. For the computations, the crystal was treated as a merohedral twin. The asymmetric unit contains two FNR molecules and one ferredoxin molecule. The packing of the FNR molecules displays a nearly tetragonal symmetry (space group P43212), whereas the ferredoxin arrangement is orthorhombic. This study provides the ®rst crystallographic model of a dissociable complex between FNR and Fd.

1. Introduction
Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductases are FAD ¯avoproteins that catalyze the reduction of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) to NADPH during photosynthesis in higher plants, algae and cyanobacteria. They accomplish this process by mediating the transfer of two electrons from photosystem I to NADP+ via a [2Fe±2S] ferredoxin in two successive one-electron steps (reviewed by Arakaki et al., 1997). Electron transfer between ferredoxin and FNR requires the formation of a ternary NADP+±FNR±Fd complex (Batie Â & Kamin, 1984; Sancho & Gomez-Moreno, 1991). The crystal structures of the individual FNR [in its oxidized state (Serre et al., 1996) and reduced state (unpublished data)] and Fd (also in both redox states; Morales et al., 1999) from the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC7119 have been determined. Here, we report the co-crystallization of the two physiological protein partners FNR and ferredoxin from the same organism. The aim of this study was to provide a structural basis for further understanding of the catalytic mechanism of NADP+ reduction during photosynthesis and, more generally, of protein±protein interactions and intermolecular electrontransfer processes.

Ferredoxin and FNR from the cyanobacterium Anabaena PCC7119 were puri®ed separately as described previously Â (Pueyo & Gomez-Moreno, 1991). Crystals containing Fd and FNR were obtained by vapour-diffusion techniques at 293 K in hanging drops, under conditions similar to those used to grow the original FNR crystals in solutions devoid of salt (Serre et al., 1996), with an excess of FNR over Fd.

solution contained 0.7 mM oxidized FNR, 0.5 mM oxidized Fd buffered with 0.1 M Tris±HCl pH 8.0; the reservoir solution contained 0.1 M MES pH 5.5, 18±21%(w/v) PEG 6000 and 0.1%(w/v) sodium azide. The droplet was initially formed by mixing 2 ml of the reservoir solution, 1 ml of a 5% -octyl glucoside solution and 2 ml of the protein solution. The crystals grow as red±orange tetragonal bipyramids (0.1 Â 0.1 Â 0.3 mm), sometimes together with yellow hexagonal bipyramid crystals typical of native FNR crystals (Fig. 1). This red± orange colour of the crystals gave the ®rst indication that they contained ferredoxin. In any case, the crystals were dif®cult to obtain reproducibly.

Prior to X-ray data collection, a crystal was soaked in the reservoir solution with 20% glycerol added. The diffraction intensities were collected at 100 K on a MAR Research imageÊ Ê plate detector to 2.38 A resolution with ! = 0.98 A at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF beamline ID2) in Grenoble. The crystal appeared to belong to the tetragonal space group P42212, with unit-cell parameters Ê a = b = 63.7, c = 158.0 A and the general re¯ection conditions h00, h = 2n; 0k0, k = 2n; 00l, l = 2n. The data were processed in the point group 4/mmm with the MOSFLM (Leslie, 1991), SCALA and TRUNCATE programs (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994; Table 1). Attempts to posiÊ tion the FNR and Fd molecules with 10±3.5 A resolution data by molecular replacement with AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) and the Anabaena PCC7119 oxidized FNR and Fd X-ray models (Serre et al., 1996; Morales et al., 1999) were unsuccessful. However, the 00l, l = 4n re¯ections were far stronger (jFj = 60') and 00l, l = 4n + 2 re¯ections weaker (jFj = 5') than the average re¯ection (jFj = 8'). Therefore, we attempted to position the FNR and Fd molecules with AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) for the two enantiomorphic space groups P41212 or P43212, for which the 00l re¯ection condition is l = 4n. This time, we easily positioned one FNR molecule in the asymmetric unit for the space group P43212 (with data in the Ê resolution range 10±3.5 A; R = 0.39, CC = 0.55). The resulting electron-density map of FNR was clearly interpretable, except for some stretches corresponding to the putative ferredoxin-

binding zone. By contrast, we could not locate any ferredoxin molecule, either by ' A 2&o À &c or &o À&c maps using phases calculated from the re®ned position of the FNR (`FNR phases') or by molecular replacement.

A Fourier map was then calculated using the anomalous amplitudes and `FNR phases'. In this map, two well resolved peaks (above 4') were observed in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2a), which were assigned to the two Fe atoms (named Fe1 and Fe2) of a ferredoxin [2Fe±2S] cluster since (i) their Ê separation (2.75 A) was comparable to that observed in the [2Fe±2S] cluster of the PCC7119 Fd (Morales et al., 1999) and Ê (ii) they were close to the FAD C8M of the FNR (7.4 A) as predicted by biochemical and biophysical experiments (Walker et al., 1991). To position the Fd molecule, the Fd model was manually rotated on a graphic display using O (Jones et al., 1991) around the Fe1±Fe2 axis, keeping the two Fe atoms of the [2Fe±2S] cluster superimposed on the two anomalous peaks. One of the two possible assignations (i.e. Fe1 Fe2 or Fe2 Fe1) of the Fe atoms to these anomalous peaks was quickly discarded because it led to extensive overlaps between Fd and FNR. For the second assignation, the Fd was rotated in steps of 5 and in each step the complex between the FNR and the rotated Fd was re®ned by rigid-body minimization with X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992a). The corresponding R and Rfree factors È (Brunger, 1992b) fell sharply and signi®cantly within a narrow range of the Fd rotation angle (30 ; Fig. 2b). All the Fd positions obtained within this angular range were identical. However, this optimal (Rmin) position (coloured red in Fig. 2c) intersected with the crystallographic dyad axis [110] so that it extensively overlapped with a symmetry-related Fd (coloured blue). At this stage, crystal packing analysis showed that the crystal contained twice as many FNR as Fd molecules, with a Ê VM of 1.96 A3 DaÀ1 (Matthews, 1968). Therefore, the symmetry of the Fd packing within the crystal could not be tetragonal. When the weak re¯ections l = 4n + 2 are taken into account, the general re¯ection conditions (h00, h = 2n; 0k0, k = 2n; 00l,

electron-density map was obtained in which the density of the ferredoxin was visible. However, the map was not interpretable owing to the presence of an overlapping density related by a pseudo-dyad axis parallel to [110]. Not surprisingly, the same results were obtained for the other possible position of the ferredoxin.

This prompted us to consider that the two possible orientations of the ferredoxin molecule in the orthorhombic cell might be accounted for by a twinned crystal with the twin components related by a dyad axis parallel to [110], even though the ratio hI2i/hIi2 = 2.1 suggested that the data were untwinned (Yeates, 1997). The asymmetric unit of each component contained two FNRs (named FNR1 and FNR2) and one Fd (Fig. 3). The re®nement was then performed against intensities with the SHELX97 twin option (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). The Ê ®rst re®nement cycle, using 15±2.5 A resolution data, led to an R and Rfree of 0.27 and 0.33, respectively (Table 2). The resulting electron-density map of the two FNRs and Fd was then fully interpretable (Fig. 4). Stepwise extension of data to Ê the 2.38 A maximum resolution, remodelling of several FNR and Fd zones and the introduction of 91 water molecules in the model resulted in a ®nal R = 0.22 and Rfree = 0.29. The re®ned fractional contribution of each twin component was 0.5. Re®nement statistics are given in Table 2.

l = 2n) could also correspond to the orthorhombic space group P212121. Accordingly, our X-ray data set were re-indexed for an mmm point group. Using these reindexed data, two FNR molecules were easily positioned within the P212121 asymmetric unit by molecular replacement with AMoRe (Navaza, Ê 1994) (for 10±3.5 A resolution data, R = 0.39, CC = 0.54). These two FNR positions are related to their corresponding positions in the tetragonal cell by a (±1, 0, À1) translation 4 8 vector. However, no position for any Fd molecule could be found within the P212121 asymmetric unit either by molecular replacement or by Fourier calculations using the `FNR phases'. Therefore, the ferredoxin molecule was positioned in the orthorhombic asymmetric unit by translating one of the two ferredoxins, symmetry-related by the [110] crystallographic axis in the tetragonal cell, by a vector (1, 0, 1). 4 8 Following a new round of re®nement cycles of a model including the two FNRs and this Fd (using data in the Ê resolution range 10±3 A; R = 0.36 and Rfree = 0.36), an

The ®nal electron-density map accounts for the FNR and Fd chemical sequences except for residues 1±10 of both FNR1 and FNR2 and residue 68 and the side chain of Asp62 of Fd, the electron densities of which are not visible. This lack of density probably re¯ects the known ¯exibility of the FNR N-terminal region (e.g. Serre et al., 1996), which points to the solvent channels, and the disorder of some ferredoxin residues in direct contact with FNR1. It is of interest to note that in contrast to the X-ray studies of the individual FNR or of its complex with NADP+ (Serre et al., 1996), the electron density of the loop 106±112 is well de®ned. It should also be pointed out that the ferredoxin electron density is well de®ned, Ê although its average B factor is very high (65 A2; Fig. 4; Table 2). In comparison with the uncomplexed structures (Serre et al., 1996; Morales et al., 1999), the FNR conformational changes are a consequence of the FNR packing in the asymmetric unit and do not involve any residue interacting with Fd, whereas the Fd changes only result from a strong interaction with FNR1, particularly through Ser64 and Phe65. The ferredoxin is not involved in crystal packing interactions. Futhermore, the interactions between Fd and FNR1 are more

2.6. A posteriori molecular-replacement calculations

As two FNR molecules (molecular weight 2 Â 35 kDa) and one Fd molecule (MW = 11 kDa) are present in the asymmetric unit, the contribution of Fd to the diffraction pattern is rather weak (about one-sixth of the scattering matter). This probably explains the failure of the ab initio molecular-

replacement calculations. To check this hypothesis, rotationfunction calculations were resumed, this time using the difference amplitude values |Á| corresponding to the scattering of the Fd component alone. The set of these |Á| values Ê (1274 data in the resolution range 10.0±6.0 A) was obtained by subtracting the calculated FNR structure factors |Fcalc|, properly scaled to take into account their contribution to the diffraction pattern (i.e. about 5/6), from the observed amplitudes |Fobs|. The resulting |Á| = |Fobs| À 0.85|Fcalc| were then truncated by eliminating all difference amplitudes larger than a cutoff value of 300.0 to provide the data set used for rotation-function calculations (891 |Á| values). The rotationfunction calculations were carried out using Crowther's fast rotation function (Crowther, 1972). The Fd search model was placed at the origin of an orthorhombic P1 cell of dimensions Ê 70 Â 70 Â 70 A. The limiting radii used during the compuÊ tations were 6.0 and 35.0 A. The calculations showed a solu tion in section  = 15 as the third peak of the rotation function and the top peak in this section (Rf value = 108, maximum = 129, mean Rf value = 3) which only differed from the previous solution by 5 along both  and . The rotated search model was then used for translationfunction calculations with the program BRUTE (Fujinaga & Read, 1987), keeping the two FNR molecules ®xed. This allowed the translation search to be undertaken using the Ê measured set of |Fobs| (in the resolution range 10.0±4.0 A) instead of the |Á| values used in the previous step. The

translation-function calculations were carried out in a series of three searches over intersecting planes, each search using only the symmetry operations corresponding to one of the 21 screw axes in space group P212121. However, the three translation sections showed many resolved peaks. Therefore, to rapidly select the translation vector we used the positions of the [2Fe±2S] cluster Fe atoms that had previously been obtained from anomalous dispersion maps. The ®gures were produced with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991), BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997) and Raster3D (Merritt & Bacon, 1997).

3. Discussion
Crystals containing FNR and Fd could only been obtained with an excess of FNR over Fd in the crystallization solutions (FNR:Fd molar ratio of 1.4 or 2). This is reminiscent of the co-crystallization of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) complexed with horse heart cytochrome c [cc(H)] [CCP/cc(H) ratio = 2.0; Pelletier & Kraut, 1992] and more recently of a complex between one domain of the Staphyloccoccus aureus protein A and a human antibody Fab fragment (Graille et al., 2000). Under these conditions, the presence of a moiety containing two FNR molecules per ferredoxin in the asymmetric unit is not surprising. It follows that the ferredoxin (Fd) makes little contribution to the overall X-ray scattering. This explains the dif®culties experienced in locating Fd within the crystal, which is further complicated by the packing of the FNR molecules showing a nearly tetragonal symmetry, whereas the Fd molecule packing is orthorhombic. The modelling of the crystal as a twin, at odds with the statistical analysis, proved to be a very powerful tool in obtaining fully interpretable electron-density maps of the ferredoxin. It is of interest to note that a similar strategy has been recently used to re®ne a RNA heptamer double helices (Mueller et al., 1999). However, the possibility that the asymmetric unit actually contains two FNR1±FNR2±Fd moieties with two possible orientations around [110] cannot be excluded. This would imply that the c parameter is doubled Ê (i.e. 316 A). Within the asymmetric unit, the interactions between Fd and FNR1 (Fd/FNR1; Table 3) are quite comparable to those observed in other biologically relevant crystallographic complexes (Pelletier & Kraut, 1992; Lo Conte et al., 1999). Moreover, a body of biological and biophysical studies in Â solution (e.g.Walker et al., 1991; Hurley et al., 1997; MartõnezÂ Julvez et al., 1998 and citations therein) strongly suggests that this Fd±FNR1 association could mimic a catalytically competent electron-transfer complex between Fd and FNR. Although the association of Fd and FNR2 or the crystallographic moiety Fd±FNR1±FNR2 are more extended than for usual crystal packing interactions (Janin, 1997), they cannot be considered to be functionally relevant (Table 3). Fd±FNR2 cannot represent an ef®cient electron-transfer complex because the two redox centres are too far away from Ê each other (14.5 A). Moreover, the FNR1±Fd±FNR2 moiety has to be considered merely as a crystallization artefact as the FNR1 and FNR2 NADP+ binding sites are buried.
