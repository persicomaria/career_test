Crystal Structure of the Amino-terminal Coiled-coil Domain of the APC Tumor Suppressor
Catherine L. Day and Tom Alber*
Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, 229 Stanley Hall #3206, Berkeley, CA 947203206, USA Coiled coils serve as dimerization domains for a wide variety of proteins, including the medically important oligomeric tumor suppressor protein, APC. Mutations in the APC gene are associated with an inherited susceptibility to colon cancer and with $75 % of sporadic colorectal tumors. To de®ne the basis for APC pairing and to explore the anatomy of dimeric Ê coiled coils, we determined the 2.4 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal dimerization domain of APC. The peptide APC-55, encompassing the heptad repeats in APC residues 2-55, primarily forms an a-helical, coiled-coil dimer with newly observed core packing features. Correlated asymmetric packing of four core residues in distinct, standard rotamers is associated with a small shift in the helix register. At the C terminus, the helices splay apart and interact with a symmetry-related dimer in the crystal to form a short, anti-parallel, four-helix bundle. N-terminal fraying and C-terminal splaying of the helices, as well as the asymmetry and helix register shift describe unprecedented dynamic excursions of coiled coils. The low stability of APC-55 and divergence from the expected coiled-coil fold support the suggestion that the APC dimerization domain may extend beyond the ®rst 55 residues.

Introduction
The a-helical coiled coil is a broadly distributed motif that mediates protein associations (Lupas, 1996). Coiled coils are comprised of two to ®ve helices wrapped around each other in a shallow superhelix. This general fold is encoded by a characteristic seven-residue repeat, (a-b-c-d-e-f-g)n, in which hydrophobic residues generally occur in the a and d positions and hydrophilic amino acid residues commonly occur elsewhere. Residues in positions a and d are buried in the interhelical interface, and residues in positions g and e mediate interhelical interactions on the edge of the interface. A central puzzle is to understand how diverse sequences give rise to distinct coiled-coil oligomers with unique functional properties. Crystal structures for a variety of coiled coils have been determined, allowing key elements controlling oligomerization to be identi®ed (Woolfson

& Alber, 1995; Lupas, 1996; Wolf et al., 1997). Studies of coiled-coil mutants suggested that the packing of the core residues in the different helical bundles strongly in¯uences oligomer choice (Harbury et al., 1993, 1994). The most common coiled coils are parallel dimers. The available structures of this motif are largely restricted to leucine zippers, which function as short dimerization elements in bZIP and bHLH-ZIP transcription factors (O'Shea et al., 1991; Ellenberger et al., 1992; Konig & Richmond, 1993; Ferre-D'Amare et al., 1993; Glover & Harrison, 1995; Junius et al., 1996). With Leu at the d positions of the heptad repeats, leucine zippers show a limited variety of core sequences. Because the sequences of dimeric coiled coils generally show greater variation, additional structures must be determined to understand structure/function relationships and to accurately model this protein family. A dimeric coiled coil with particular medical importance occurs at the amino terminus of the protein APC. Mutations in the APC gene are associated with a genetic predisposition to colon cancer, and they occur early in the progression of sporadic human colorectal tumors (Groden et al., 1991; Nishisho et al., 1991).

148 of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas in the Western population, APC mutations are among the most common disease-linked genetic lesions. APC acts as a tumor suppressor. Loss-of-function mutations are associated with polyp growth, and restoration of the wild-type allele into an APC mutant cell line can lead to reversion of the transformed phenotype (Morin et al., 1996). APC functions as a binary switch that promotes cell migration and down-regulates b-catenin, a key transducer in the Wingless-Wnt signaling cascade (Rubinfeld et al., 1993; Su et al., 1993b). Inactivating mutations in APC reduce degradation of b-catenin, which in turn binds the Lef and Tcf transcription factors and alters expression of genes (e.g. c-myc; He et al., 1998) responsive to these activators. Glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK3b) and axin also associate with APC and in¯uence b-catenin stability (Rubinfeld et al., 1996; Behrens et al., 1998; Kishida et al., 1998). In addition, APC associates with plakoglobin, tubulin, EB1 and the tumor suppressor hDLG (Kinzler & Vogelstein, 1996). These associations may re¯ect additional, uncharacterized functions. APC oligomerization has been proposed to play a role in the disease phenotype. APC proteins, each containing $2800 residues, comprise a family of variants produced by alternative mRNA splicing. The C-terminal region contains a tubulinbinding domain (Smith et al., 1994; Deka et al., 1998), and sequences in the middle third of APC mediate interactions with b-catenin (Su et al., 1993b) and axin (Kishida et al., 1998). Residues 453766 contain seven copies of the 42-residue armadillo repeat, a putative protein-binding motif with unknown speci®city. The amino terminal 900 amino acid residues of APC contain hydrophobic heptad repeats characteristic of a-helical coiled coils, suggesting the capacity for dimerization. Among the hundreds of different APC mutations identi®ed in both sporadic and familial carcinomas, most predict the expression of truncated proteins (Smith & Kinzler, 1993). Truncated and wild-type polypeptides co-immunopreciptate with antibodies speci®c for a C-terminal epitope absent from the mutant proteins, suggesting that APC forms homooligomers in vivo (Su et al., 1993a). Such pairing with mutant chains may inactivate the wild-type protein and contribute to the genetic dominance of APC mutations. Sequences necessary for oligomerization have been mapped to the amino-terminal 171 amino acid residues of APC (Su et al., 1993a). The aminoterminal 55 residues, which contain a continuous heptad repeat, are suf®cient to form a parallel, ahelical dimer in solution (Joslyn et al., 1993). Deletion of the ®rst 45 residues of APC (corresponding to exon 1 of the gene) signi®cantly reduces the dimerization capacity of larger APC fragments (Joslyn et al., 1993; Su et al., 1993a). Interestingly, truncated variants retaining 157 or fewer amino acids produce an attenuated polyposis phenotype (Spirio et al., 1993). These results suggest that the

amino terminus contains a functionally crucial, dimeric coiled coil. To understand better the sequence-structure relationships in dimeric coiled coils and to de®ne the oligomerization domain of APC, we deterÊ mined the 2.4 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of residues 2-55 (APC-55). Residues 6-41 form a coiled coil that reveals a variety of new interactions. Fraying of the N terminus and splaying of the C terminus illustrate unexpected alternate structural states.

Results
The ®rst heptad-repeat region of APC ends at Ile55. Using the program PAIRCOIL (Berger et al., 1995), residues 1-55 of APC give a score of 0.84 for the likelihood of a coiled-coil fold (Figure 1(a)). A peptide corresponding to this fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli, and crystals containing a dimer in the asymmetric unit were obtained at 4  C. The crystals were fragile and radiation sensitive, requiring freezing in liquid nitrogen for X-ray data collection. The structure was determined by the single isomorphous replacement method using a K2PtCl4 derivative (Table 1). Initial experimental phases were calculated using native and derivative data to Ê 3.0 A resolution, and the phases were extended to Ê 2.5 A resolution by solvent ¯attening and histogram matching (Cowtan, 1994).

149 itions (where prime denotes the other chain). Three of six possible g-to-eH ion pairs are apparent in the APC coiled-coil segment. In addition to these similarities, the APC-55 structure expands available descriptions of coiledcoil anatomy. Newly observed, core side-chain interactions include Tyr6, Leu27, Leu34 and Ala41 at a positions and Asn30 at a d position (Figure 3). Tyr6 packs in the core, and the side-chain hydroxyl group is within hydrogen bonding distance of the main-chain carbonyl group of Ala4H of the opposing chain. This interaction requires a non-helical conformation for the amino terminal residues. Leu27, Leu34 and Asn30 adopt distinct rotamers on each chain (Figure 3(b) and (c)). A novel arrangement also is observed at Ala41, which fails to ®ll the core space and allows ordered solvent molecules between the helices (Figure 3(d)). On the edge of the dimer interface, a hydrogen-bonded, g-eH interaction is apparent between HisA33 and GluB38 (Figure 3(e)). Consistent with the underlying asymmetry of the core Leu34 residues, the analogous gH -e residues HisB33 and GluA38 are sterically excluded from making direct contacts. Thus, despite the complementary charged residues on both sides of the dimer, the core asymmetry precludes simultaneous formation of both ion pairs. Although the two chains are chemically identical, considerable structural asymmetry is apparent in the APC-55 coiled coil. The asymmetry of core side-chains (Figure 3) is associated with similar backbone conformations (Table 2), but the helices Ê are shifted slightly (0.8-1.4 A) out of register (Figure 4(a)). Remarkably, the asymmetric core packing interactions are tightly coupled. Helix A contributes the asymmetric rotamers of Asn20, Leu27, Asn30 and Leu34 that point ``outward'' toward the solvent, and helix B contributes all the equivalent side-chains pointing ``inward'' toward the interface (Figure 4(b)). Near Ala41, the helices straighten and splay apart (Figure 5). Met44 is the last residue to make direct intradimer contacts in the interface. The subsequent core residues mediate contacts to a symmetry-related dimer in the crystal, producing a short, anti-parallel, four-helix bundle. The helices in the four-helix bundle motif are straighter than those in the coiled coil (Figure 4(a)). Unlike parallel coiled coils, each cross-sectional layer of the C-terminal four-helix bundle contains two a residues and two d residues that alternate around the layer. The helices fray at the carboxyl terminus, and the density is weak for residues A53-A55.

tron density map (Figure 1(b)) clearly showed the helices and allowed the sequence register to be determined unambiguously. Due to the anisotropic X-ray scattering, model re®nement using data to Ê 2.4 A resolution bene®ted from the use of anisotropic scale factors. The re®ned model, containing 107/108 residues in the dimer, 34 water molecules and one sulphate ion, has good geometry and R and free R values of 23.26 % and 27.46 %, respectively (Figure 1(c); Table 1). In agreement with circular dichroism experiments (Joslyn et al., 1993), the APC-55 peptide is mainly a-helical. Three distinct motifs are apparent in the structure (Figure 2). The central part of the sequence, residues 6-41, forms the expected parallel, two-stranded coiled coil. The coiled coil ends near Ala41, where the helices straighten and splay apart to form a short, anti-parallel, four-helix bundle by associating with a symmetry-related dimer in the crystal (Figure 2(a)). Residues 2-5 adopt a non-helical conformation. Some of the interactions in the APC-55 coiled coil are similar to those in previously determined structures of leucine zippers. The helices generally display canonical knobs-into-holes packing, in which the side-chains at the a and d positions form successive layers (Figure 2(b)), and contacts are made with four residues from the opposing helix. The a-position side-chains point out of the helix interface and the d-position side-chains point into the interface. These arrangements correspond to the ``parallel'' and ``perpendicular'' packing modes ®rst observed in the GCN4 leucine zipper (O'Shea et al., 1991; Harbury et al., 1993, 1994). Despite differences in sequence context, core residues that are identical to those in leucine zippers adopt the same rotamers as those observed leucine zipper structures (O'Shea et al., 1991). Examples in APC include the leucine residues at d positions and valine residues and asparagine at a positions (Figure 3(a)). The similarities even extend to the asymmetric arrangement of the a-position Asn20 in APC-55, which adopts distinct rotamers (w1  À 69  and À5  , w2  À 166  and À100  ) in the two monomers. Notwithstanding the increased sequence diversity, APC-55 resembles the simpler leucine zippers in overall structural features, such as interhelical distances and superhelical pitch (Table 2). Like parallel coiled coils in general, hydrogen bonded ion pairs occur between oppositely charged residues at g and succeeding eH pos-

Discussion
APC mutations play a critical early role in the development of colon tumors (Groden et al., 1991; Nishisho et al., 1991). Available evidence indicates that the N-terminal, heptad-repeat region is important and suf®cient for dimerization (Joslyn

et al., 1993). The crystal structure of APC-55 con®rms the expectation from sequence analysis and biochemical data (Joslyn et al., 1993) that this sequence forms a coiled coil. Splaying of the C terminus in the structure, however, coupled with evidence from solution studies and genetic experiments (Joslyn et al., 1993), suggests that the APC dimerization domain may extend beyond the N-terminal coiled coil. The APC-55 tetramer trapped in the crystals is likely to be rare in solution, where the dimeric coiled coil likely continues to the C terminus (Joslyn et al., 1993). Equilibrium sedimentation data on APC-55 alone and fused to the l repressor headpiece provide evidence only for the presence of dimers (Joslyn et al., 1993). More directly, the Ile55Cys mutant of APC-55 undergoes facile disulphide crosslinking to produce a two-chain species. This crosslinking is not expected on the basis of the APC-55 crystal structure, where the C termini are Ê separated by $18.5 A (Figures 2(a) and 5). MoreÊ over, the surface area (700 A2/dimer) buried by each helix pair in the four-helix bundle in the crystal is too small to support the expectation of substantial stability (Janin et al., 1988). Consequently, we conclude that the C-terminal ten residues of APC-55 are trapped by crystal contacts in a nonnative conformation.

The divergence of the APC-55 C terminus in the crystals supports the idea that additional sequences or other proteins may enhance APC dimerization. Consistent with this conclusion, the APC-55 dimer shows unexpectedly low thermal stability, with a Tm of only 36  C (Joslyn et al., 1993) at a peptide concentration (8 mM) much higher than the in vivo concentration of APC. The modest thermal stability of the APC-55 peptide is not due to its small size. Coiled coils of only 33 residues that resist boiling have been reported (Harbury et al., 1993). Moreover, an APC fragment containing residues 46-256 apparently mediates weak oligomerization in E. coli of a fused reporter protein, the DNA-binding domain of the cI repressor of phage l (Joslyn et al., 1993). Because the APC segment encompassing residues 46-55 is too short to form an autonomous coiled coil (Su et al., 1994), these results suggest that additional oligomerization motifs may occur in the ®rst 256 residues. A candidate second pairing motif, a heptadrepeat segment with a PAIRCOIL (Berger et al., 1995) score of 0.69, occurs from residues 125-156. This region corresponds to a genetically de®ned functional boundary. Compared to the attenuated phenotype in individuals with APC truncations at residue 157 or shorter, colon cancer is more aggressive in patients who inherit mutations leading to

truncation of APC at or beyond residue 168 (Spirio et al., 1993). Two explanations have been proposed for this functional boundary. The shorter polypeptides may regain an activity that contributes to the normal role of APC, or the shorter chains may lack an activity required for APC mutants to have a dominant negative effect on APC function (Spirio et al., 1993). The predicted coiled-coil segment at the genetic boundary, in conjunction with the instability and ¯exibility of APC-55, support the idea that the shorter APC fragments associated with the attenuated phenotype may be de®cient in dimerization. The APC-55 structure is consistent with the proposal that APC chains shorter than

168 residues display a reduced level of pairing af®nity (Spirio et al., 1993). The switch of the C terminus between the parallel dimer and anti-parallel tetramer highlights the compatibility of hydrophobic heptad repeat sequences with distinct folds and oligomers. The transition between the coiled-coil and four-helixbundle motifs occurs near core residues, Ala41 and Met44, that are both capable of mediating local ¯exibility. Core alanine residues, presumably because they are small and leave a cavity in the helix interface, destabilize coiled coils relative to larger hydrophobic residues (Gonzalez et al., 1996; Monera et al., 1996; Moitra et al., 1997).

Figure 5. Helix separation in the APC-55 crystal structure. Interhelix distance plotted as a function of residue number. The axes of the helices were calculated from the centroid of the main-chain coordinates over a sliding seven-residue window. The helices diverge in the fourhelix bundle, starting at Ala41.

Figure 4. Helix asymmetry. (a) Superposition of the backbones of residues 6-41 in helix A and helix B (bottom) shows that the individual helices in the coiled-coil segment have similar main-chain conformations. The helices in the C-terminal, four-helix bundle superimpose poorly. The register shift in the coiled coil is evident as a small horizontal misalignment of the top helices. (b) Backbone superposition of residues 18-25, 25-32 and 32-39 shows that the core side-chains and corresponding g-eH interactions display coupled conformations. Asymmetrically disposed core side-chains from the helix on the left point into the interface, and g and eHn  1 residues form ion pairs on the corresponding side of the dimer (top). In contrast, the same core side-chains from the helix on the right point out of the interface. These core rotamers block the close approach of the adjacent g and eHn  1 residues (bottom) except for Glu19 and Arg24, which are positioned to form distinct ion pairs on both sides of the dimer.

ionine residues also promote ¯exibility. In the GCN4 leucine zipper, for example, an a-position Met residue at the border of the basic region extends to maintain interhelix contacts in the DNA complex (Alber, 1993). Met44 in APC-55 shows that Met in a d position also can mediate helix separation. Such conformational plasticity may account for the signi®cant enrichment of Met at the core positions of coiled coils (Woolfson & Alber, 1995). Most of the APC-55 sequence forms a standard, dimeric coiled coil. Similarities with previously determined leucine-zipper structures support the view that many features of coiled coils are modular, with identical core residues adopting equivalent rotamers in different sequence contexts

(Figure 3). This commonality applies not only to canonical leucine residues at d positions and valine residues at a positions, but also to the dynamic asymmetry of the a-position Asn residue. Such conserved features support the notion that the non-native structure of the extreme C terminus trapped in the APC-55 crystal does not disrupt standard features of the coiled coil in the ®rst 41 residues. Overall, the repeated conformational motifs observed in APC-55 imply that a catalog of core interactions could facilitate accurate modeling of coiled-coil structures. The APC-55 coiled coil also reveals new core packing motifs (Figure 3) and provides unprecedented evidence for coiled-coil dynamics (Figure 4). The ¯exibility of APC-55 is apparent from the asymmetry of the coiled-coil region. Core sidechains of Asn20, Leu27, Asn30 and Leu34 adopt distinct rotamers in the two helices. Analogous, asymmetric, position-a Asn residues in leucine zippers have been shown by NMR measurements to undergo rapid conformational interconversion (Junius et al., 1995, 1996; MacKay et al., 1996). In APC-55, the approximately isosteric Asn20, Leu27 and Leu34 at a-positions adopt similar rotamer pairs, consistent with the idea that packing, rather than polarity, provides the basis for the asymmetric structure. In contrast, the asymmetry of the d-position Asn30, unlike the canonical symmetric leucine residues, is apparently governed by the polarity of the Asn side-chain. The asymmetry of the core extends to the ¯anking residues, where the core side-chains that point out of the interface block close contacts between g and succeeding eH residues on one side of the dimer (e.g. Figure 3(e)). The asymmetry is re¯ected not only in the rotamer distribution, but also in the register of the helices themselves. Superposition of one helix on

154 the other shows that the two helices in the coiled coil adopt similar main-chain conformations (Figure 4(a), bottom). Unlike the GCN4 leucine zipper, however, the APC-55 coiled-coil helices are slightly out of register along the superhelical axis (Table 2; Figure 4(a), top). This global shift of Ê $0.8 A for the residues in the center of the coiled coil is too large to be an artifact of model building or re®nement procedures. The register shift in the APC coiled coil may be associated with coupled core asymmetry. At the four asymmetric core positions (Asn20, Leu27, Asn30 and Leu34), all the side-chains that point out of the interface come from helix A (Figure 4(b)). Assuming that only two rotamers (minus and trans) are favored in helices (McGregor et al., 1987), the chances of trapping this state by chance are approximately 2À3, or 1/8 if the rotamers were uncorrelated. Thus, the APC-55 structure suggests an almost 90 % chance that the rotamers of asymmetrically disposed side-chains are coupled between layers in the coiled coil. This coupling would be associated with exchange of g-to-eH ion pairs from side-to-side of the dimer and a small shift in helix register that would drive the helices in the coiled-coil segment back and forth passed each other (Figure 4(b)). As a result, core asymmetry may facilitate local and long-range conformational transitions in dimeric coiled coils. Analogous piston motions of coiled coils have been proposed to propagate transmembrane conÊ formational changes >200 A upon aspartate binding to the aspartate chemotaxis receptor (Otteman et al., 1999). The mechanism of this conformational change, however, has not been determined at high resolution. It will be of interest to see if coupled rotamer ¯ips are generally associated with longitudinal changes in coiled-coil structures. The modular character of coiled coils supports the expectation that the new features observed here can provide the basis for improved modeling of coiled coils with locally similar sequences. In addition, the fraying and splaying of the helices, as Ê well as the register shift of $1 A between APC helices, provide evidence for previously uncharacterized structural ¯exibility. Thus, the APC-55 coiled coil affords an improved basis for detailed models of coiled-coil dynamics, structure and function.

Structure of a Dimeric Coiled Coil from APC continued to grow for up to ten days. The crystals have the symmetry of space group P6522, with unit cell Ê Ê dimensions of a  b  66.86 A, c  127.47 A. Anisotropic Ê diffraction was observed to 2.4 A resolution. The crystals were temperature sensitive, radiation sensitive and dif®cult to manipulate. Structure determination Prior to data collection, the crystals were brie¯y transferred to reservoir solution containing 20 % (v/v) MPD and frozen in liquid nitrogen. All X-ray data were obtained at low temperature using an MSC cryostream instrument. Data were collected with a R-Axis IIC image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator (50 kV, 150 mA). The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) and scaled using the CCP4 suite of programs (CCP4, 1994). The structure was solved by the single isomorphous replacement (SIR) method using a derivative obtained by soaking a crystal for two hours in mother liquor saturated with K2PtCl4. To screen for derivatives, ¯akes of heavy atom compounds were added to the drops in which the crystals grew, because we were unable to ®nd a stabilizing solution into which the crystals could be safely transferred. Two heavy atom sites were identi®ed from inspection of the isomorphous difference Patterson maps, and these sites were con®rmed using the program Ê SHELX (Sheldrick, 1990). Using 20.0-3.0 A resolution data, the sites were re®ned and SIR phases were calculated using MLPHARE (CCP4, 1994). Phases were Ê extended to 2.5 A resolution with DM (CCP4, 1994) using iterative cycles of solvent ¯attening and histogram matching in thin shells of increasing resolution. Solvent ¯attening signi®cantly improved the map and allowed a polyalanine model to be built for $80 % of the structure using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). The location of a number of side-chains was obvious at this time, and the register of the helices was unambiguous. In successive re®nement rounds, side-chains were added as their density became apparent in maps calculated using combined model and experimental phases. Refinement Cycles of positional least squares re®nement with Ê TNT (Tronrud, 1992) using 20-2.4 A resolution data >2s, combined with model building using the program TURBO FRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1991) reduced the R-factor to 28.7 %. After much of the model had been built, highly restrained B-factor re®nement was carried out and water molecules were added. At this stage, the R-factor dropped to 25.5 %. Further improvement was obtained by accounting for the anisotropic nature of the diffraction. The ®nal stages of re®nement were carried out using anisotropic temperature factor correction in È the program CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). The free R-value was calculated with 723 re¯ections (10.2 % of the data). The model consists of residues 2 to 55 in chain A, residues 3 to 55 in chain B and 34 water molecules. The C terminus of chain A has weak density and Ile55 is modeled as alanine. The model displays excellent stereochemistry as determined by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), with 98 % of the residues in the most favored region in a Ramachandran plot. Ribbon diagrams were made using the program MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996).

Materials and Methods
Peptide purification and crystallization Recombinant APC-55 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and puri®ed as described (Joslyn et al., 1993). The composition of the peptide, including removal in vivo of the N-terminal Met residue, was con®rmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Crystals of APC-55 were obtained using the sitting drop method. Drops of 2 ml of peptide (20 mg/ml) were mixed with 2 ml of reservoir solution (15 % (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 M ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.8)) at 4  C. Crystals appeared after two days and
