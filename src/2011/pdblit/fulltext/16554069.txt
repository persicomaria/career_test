The three-dimensional structure of human tissue inhibitor of metalloproÊ teinases-2 (TIMP-2) was determined by X-ray crystallography to 2.1 A resolution. The structure of the inhibitor consists of two domains. The N-terminal domain (residues 1-110) is folded into a b-barrel, similar to the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold otherwise found in certain DNA-binding proteins. The C-terminal domain (residues 111-194) contains a parallel stranded b-hairpin plus a b-loop-b motif. Comparison of the structure of uncomplexed human TIMP-2 with that of bovine TIMP-2 bound to the catalytic domain of human MMP-14 suggests an internal rotation between the two domains of $13 upon binding to the protease. Furthermore, local conformational differences in the two structures that might be induced by formation of the protease-inhibitor complex have been found. The most prominent of these involves residues 27-40 of the A-B b-hairpin loop. Structure-based alignment of amino acid sequences of representatives of the TIMP family maps the sequence differences mainly to loop regions, and some of these differences are proposed to be responsible for the particular properties of the various TIMP species.

Introduction
Enhanced turnover of connective tissue is a characteristic feature of many physiological and pathological conditions. These include extensive tissue remodeling during developmental processes, wound healing and pregnancy, as well as tissue destruction involved in in¯ammatory or autoimmune diseases and cancer metastasis (BirkedalHansen, 1995; Liotta & Stetler-Stevenson, 1990; Stetler-Stevenson et al., 1993). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of Ca2-dependent Znenzymes, with the potential to degrade all components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), play a major role in these processes (Banyai et al., 1994).

Controlled extracellular proteolysis requires a delicate balance of activation and inhibition of MMPs. Most MMPs are secreted as latent proenzymes, which require activation by the removal of a propeptide (Van Wart & Birkedal-Hansen, 1990). One way of controlling extracellular MMP activity is thus the activation of the proenzymes, another means of control being a group of speci®c inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). To date, there are four known members of the TIMP family, termed TIMP-1 to TIMP-4, glycosylated or non-glycosylated proteins with molecular masses ranging from 20 ±30 kDa (Gomez et al., 1997). TIMPs speci®cally inhibit activated matrix metalloproteinases by forming a noncovalent stoichiometric complex with the catalytic site of active MMPs. TIMP-2 can bind to the latent form of MMP-2 through additional interactions with the hemopexin domain (Olson et al., 1997). The physiological relevance of this activity is not entirely clear, but the proMMP-2-TIMP-2 complex has been proposed to play a key role in the physio# 1998 Academic Press

1134 logical activation of MMP-2 by the membranebound MT1-MMP (MMP-14; Butler et al., 1998; Zucker et al., 1998). MMP-2 (72 kDa type IV collagenase, gelatinase A) is widely expressed in the stromal cells during development (Reponen et al., 1992) and is thought to be mainly responsible for basement membrane turnover, as well as for that of stroma. It is strongly expressed in stromal cells at the front of invading cancer cells (Pyke et al., 1992, 1993). Therefore, this enzyme has been a major target for the development of drugs that could prevent cells from crossing tissue borders, such as in tumor metastasis. Since TIMPs, and particularly TIMP-2, are central components of this process, rational design of speci®c therapeutic antagonists would bene®t from structural knowledge of both MMPs and TIMPs, as well as their complexes. Sequence analyses have suggested a two-domain structure for TIMPs and it has been shown that the N-terminal domain is suf®cient for metalloproteinase inhibition (Murphy et al., 1991). A low-resolution NMR structure has been reported for the N-terminal domain of TIMP-2 (Williamson et al., 1994). This study revealed that this domain contains an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold otherwise found in certain DNA/oligosaccharide-binding proteins (Murzin, 1993). The crystal structure of TIMP-1 in complex with the catalytic domain of MMP-3 (Gomis-Ruth et al., 1997) showed that the inhibitor is a contiguous wedge-like molecule slotting with its entire edge into the active-site cleft of the target MMP. NMR chemical shift perturbation provided further evidence for which peptide regions of TIMP-2 are involved in the interactions with MMP-3 (Williamson et al., 1997). Here, we report the crystal structure of fullÊ length human TIMP-2 at 2.1 A resolution. Comparison with the three-dimensional (3D) structure of bovine TIMP-2 bound to the catalytic domain of MMP-14 (Fernandez-Catalan et al., 1998) suggests that global and local conformational changes

accompany the formation of the protease-inhibitor complex.

Results and Discussion
Structure solution and quality of the electron density map Expression of TIMP-2 with a baculovirus/insect cell system and puri®cation by a combination of standard and HPLC ion-exchange steps yielded isoelectrically pure TIMP-2 1± 2 mg per litre conditioned medium. Crystals obtained after macro Ê and micro seeding diffracted X-rays to 2.1 A using synchrotron radiation. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with cell dimenÊ Ê Ê sions of a  72.05 A, b  52.7 A, c  46.1 A. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using a model of bovine TIMP-2. The ®nal electron density map (Figure 1) for the re®ned model contains continuous electron density for residues 1-182 of the polypeptide chain. No electron density was found for the C-terminal 12 residues, indicating disorder for this part of the chain. Weak electron density and high B-factors, were obtained for residues 152-158 and for some surface side-chains, especially in the A and B b-strands. Pro137 which is within a tight loop formed by Cys133-Cys138 is in cis conformation. The ®nal model re®ned to Rfree  27.1% and R  23.8%, consists of 1415 protein atoms and 63 solvent molecules. No residue is found in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot and the average B-factor for of the ®nal Ê model is 34.0 A2. Details of the re®nement are summarized in Table 1. Overall structure of TIMP-2 The 194 amino acid residues of human TIMP-2 are folded into two domains (Figure 2), making few packing interactions to each other. The overall È fold is similar to that of TIMP-1 (Gomis-Ruth et al., 1997). The N-terminal domain, comprising 110 residues, is dominated by a b-barrel structure motif,

the OB fold (Williamson et al., 1994). The C-terminal domain is characterized by a b-hairpin plus a b-loop-b motif of parallel strands. A survey of the atomic coordinates available at the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank using the program TOP (Lu, 1996) did not reveal any protein with a folding topology similar to this domain. At the N terminus there is a short extended stretch of seven residues bound to the barrel core

by two disul®de bridges (Cys1-Cys72, Cys3Cys101). After helix a1, which accommodates sidechains responsible for the interaction with the C-terminal domain, the course of the peptide chain turns via a short loop, entering the b-barrel at strand A. Strand A forms the ®rst, long stave of the b-barrel. It makes a long curved exposed b-hairpin with the antiparallel strand B of the b-barrel (Figures 2 and 3). The chain continues,

1136 antiparallel to B, with strand C where the chain changes direction via a 310-helical turn and connects to strand D. The OB motif as initially described (Murzin, 1993) contains an a-helix in this connecting segment. Strand D is very curved and the ®rst part is inserted between strands A and F, while the second half is outside strand E. The bbarrel is completed by strand F, which in the OB fold (Murzin, 1993) is a continuation of strand E. The overall fold of this domain as revealed by crystallography is in agreement with the low-resolution structure of the N-terminal domain of human TIMP-2 determined by NMR (Williamson et al., 1994). The chain enters the C-terminal domain via three short helices, a 310-helical turn, an a-helix parallel with a1, and one more 310-helix. It then folds into a motif consisting of two pairs of b-strands separated by a loop with the short helices, a6 and a7. The ®rst sheet is formed by the parallel b-strands G and H, connected via an extended chain of eight residues. This motif is further stabilized through a disul®de bond, Cys133-Cys138 from b-strand G to the extended chain. At the carboxyl end of this sheet there is a crossover connection giving rise to a potential binding groove. The second sheet consists of the antiparallel b-strands I and J, connected as a b-hairpin. The two b-sheets are linked to each other by the disul®de bridges between Cys128Cys175 connecting the N termini of strands G and J, and Cys146-Cys167 which connects strands H and I. The two domains are linked through a disul®de bridge between Cys13 in helix 1 and Cys126 in helix 5. Further interactions between the two domains are provided by hydrogen bonds between the side-chain of Gln9 and the main-chain carbonyl and amino group of Cys167, from the side-chain of Gln10 to main chain NH of Ile130 and from the side-chain of His7 to the carbonyl group of Gln161. Hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals contacts are formed between side-chains of a-helix 1 and helix 5, strand G, Trp148, helix 7 and strand I. TIMP-2 is highly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage in the C-terminal domain (Miyazaki et al., 1993; Willenbrock et al., 1993). The crystal structure reveals that the region between residues 152 and 159, as well as the C terminus are ¯exible with exposed parts that can render it susceptible to proteases. TIMP-2 variants with cleavage in the C-terminal domain are likely to be the main source for heterogeneity in different preparations and can explain the dif®culties encountered in obtaining crystallizable material. Binding to the protease induces global and local conformational changes in TIMP-2 Comparison of the structure of the unbound human TIMP-2 and the bound bovine TIMP-2, as observed in a complex with the catalytic domain of MMP-14 (Fernandez-Catalan et al., 1998) reveals differences in the mutual orientation of the two

domains as well as a number of conformational differences in loop regions (Figure 4). A superposition of the whole molecules gives an rms value of Ê Ê 1.32 A for 148 structurally equivalent (within 3.8 A of each other in aligned structures, see Materials and Methods) Ca atoms, out of the 182 observed Ca atoms. Alignment of the individual domains results in 97 equivalenced Ca atoms with an rms of Ê 1.11 A for the N-terminal domain and 63 Ca atoms

1137 surface (Figure 4) of TIMP-2, which is more exposed in the unbound form, changes accessibility upon domain rotation. It thus appears that binding of TIMP-2 is accompanied by a global and local structural transitions involving a domain rotation as well as conformational changes of particular segments of the polypeptide chain, in particular residues 27-40. One possible concern is that the observed conformational differences re¯ect species differences (bovine versus human TIMP-2) rather than structural changes upon binding of the inhibitor to the protease. This is, however, not very likely, due to the high degree of amino acid sequence identity between human and bovine TIMP-2 (94%), which suggests a very similar structure. Comparison to other TIMPs All the disul®de bridges are conserved in the TIMP family, and there is strong sequence conservation for the remaining part of the polypeptide chain (Figure 3). When the residues that are strictly conserved in TIMP sequences are mapped to the 3D structure, the most notable clustering of conserved side-chains is found at the domain-domain interface. In this region, where the chain passes from the N-terminal domain to the C-terminal domain, a core is formed between the a-helix 1 and residues from the C-terminal domain. The cluster of conserved amino acids consists of residues His7, Pro8 and Glu10 located on a-helix 1, the disul®de bridge between Cys13 and Cys126 and residues Gln111, Tyr122, Trp148, and Trp177. A second cluster of conserved side-chains is found in the N-terminal domain and consists of residues Val18-Lys22, Lys48, Lys51, Met52 and Trp107. The largest differences in amino acid sequence between the TIMP families are found in some of the exposed loop regions, the A-B loop, the B-C loop where it enters strand C, the loop before entering strand D, the loop between helices 6 and 7, and the ¯exible residues in the carboxy terminus. It is likely that some of these regions determine the difference in activity within the TIMP family towards latent MMPs. In contrast to TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 can complex the inactive proform of MMP-2 (Bigg et al., 1997) while TIMP-1 shows corresponding activity towards proMMP-9 (Olson et al., 1997; Wilhelm et al., 1989). The formation of complexes between TIMPs and latent MMPs involves binding sites in the C-terminal domains of both the enzyme and inhibitor (Olson et al., 1997). Additionally, there is evidence that binding sites in the N-terminal domain of latent MMP-2 outside the catalytic domain might participate in complex formation with TIMP-2 (Olson et al., 1997; Willenbrock et al., 1993). The A-B b-hairpin is longer in TIMP-2 than in TIMP-1 and more exposed. This loop and the loop between helices 6 and 7 in the C-terminal domain are part of the ridge-like structure that is the inhibitory active edge of the TIMP-2 molecule. We propose that the A-B hairpin could mediate the

Ê with rms 1.03 A for the C-terminal domain. When using the alignment derived from an individual domain to superpose the whole protease inhibitor molecule, it is clear that the superposition of the other domain not used in the alignment is signi®cantly worse, re¯ected in rms values of 2.05 or Ê 1.96 A for the Ca atoms of the N and C-terminal domain, respectively. This indicates a shift in the relative orientation of the two domains in the bound compared to the unbound form of the inhibitor. The difference in orientation can be described as a rigid body rotation of $13 corresponding to a domain closure in the bound form. The rotation axis passes through the domaindomain boundary close to the position of helix 1 and helix 4. Four TIMP-2 regions involving residues 27-41 (A-B loop), 72-82 (connector-D loop), 139-143 (G-H loop) and 173-175 (I-J loop) show signi®cant mainchain differences in the free and bound conformation of the inhibitor. Both in the free as well as in the complexed TIMP-2 molecule, the A-B loop is strongly twisted. Upon complex formation, the peripheral part of the A-B loop tilts signi®cantly and interacts with the loop connecting b-strands 3 and 4, the characteristic S-loop, of the cognate MMP (Figure 4). The connector-D loop is weakly de®ned by electron density in the complexed TIMP-2 molecule, which might, in part, explain the large deviations. The large shift observed for the G-H and I-J loops might be caused by the different crystal contacts and the deviations at the C terminus are due to ¯exibility in both states. The edge segments of TIMP-2 formed by the A-B loop (35-42), the C-connector loop (residues 66-72), the N-terminal segment (1-5), the G-H loop (132135) and the multiple turn loop (151-155) are in direct contact with the catalytic domain of MT1MMP (Fernandez-Catalan et al., 1998). During complex formation these loop segments (except A-B) move only slightly to adapt to the enzyme, and do not change their internal main-chain conformation to a signi®cant extent. Their temperature factors, however, decrease to relatively low values, re¯ecting a considerable rigidi®cation upon binding to the active-site cleft of the protease. An NMR chemical shift pertubation study of a truncated form of TIMP-2 with MMP-3 suggested that a rather large surface of the N-terminal domain of the inhibitor interacts with the protease (Williamson et al., 1997). This surface, as de®ned by the NMR study, is formed by the N terminus and part of the ®rst a-helix (residues 1-11), the A-B loop including parts of the b-strands (residues 27-41), helix 2 (residues 68-73), parts of strand D (residues 87-90) and the E-F loop (residues 97-104). Two of these regions show local conformational differences between the free human and bound bovine TIMP. One large conformational change is found for the A-B loop and the second structural difference is found for helix 2. These two regions of TIMP-2 are in direct contact with the protease (FernandezCatalan et al., 1998). Furthermore, large parts of this

1138 interaction with the propeptide of latent MMP-2 and that the C-terminal domain could be involved in the binding to the hemopexin domain of MMP-2. Structural information available so far suggests that the interaction between TIMP-2 and latent MMP-2 most likely involves residues outside the active site of the protease. In the case of latent MMPs, the catalytic site is blocked by the propeptide, whose conserved cysteine residue coordinates strongly to the catalytic Zn. The interaction described for the complex between active MMP-3 and TIMP-1 (Gomis-Ruth et al., 1997) is not possible as long as the propeptide is in place, suggesting that the mechanism of binding to latent MMPs is different. Comparison to other proteins The b-barrel of TIMP-2 belongs to the ubiquitous OB fold with structural similarity to certain DNA and oligosaccharide-binding proteins (Williamson et al., 1994). The highest degree of structural homology was found for human replication protein A (Bochkarev et al., 1997; Figure 5). A superposition Ê of the two structures gave an rms of 1.70 A for a 55 structurally equivalent C -atoms of the ®rst subdomain of the DNA-binding protein and 45 structurally equivalent Ca-atoms with an rms of Ê 1.45 A for the second. TIMP-1 was originally discovered as a growth factor, and a similar activity was later demonstrated for TIMP-2 (Stetler-Stevenson et al., 1992). There is evidence that the growth factor activity is associated with the N-terminal domain but that it is independent from the inhibitory function of TIMP (Hayakawa et al., 1994). It is tempting to speculate that the homology to DNA-binding proteins goes beyond a mere structural similarity and that TIMPs might interact with nucleic acids in an analogous way, explaining their activity as growth factors. However, none of the TIMP disul®de bridges are conserved in the DNA-binding proteins. Furthermore, the side-chains involved in DNA binding in human replication protein A are not conserved in TIMPs. It is thus improbable that these proteins are related and the similarity in structure is most likely a result of convergent evolution to a stable fold.

Materials and Methods
Production and purification of recombinant human TIMP-2 For the production of full-length human TIMP-2 protein, a cDNA clone was inserted into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 as an NcoI-restricted, bluntended fragment. The vector was cotransfected into Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) insect cells with baculovirus genomic DNA (Pharmingen). The recombinant virus obtained was plaque puri®ed and used for the production of a virus stock. Typically, the protein was expressed in H5 (Trichoplusia ni) cells (Invitrogen) and the infection was allowed to proceed for 72 ± 96 hours. Protein puri®cation was carried out at 4 C, except for the HPLC steps, which were performed at room temperature. After centrifugation the conditioned medium was concentrated two- to ®vefold and ®ltrated with 5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) using a 0.09 m2 PLGC Prep/Scale (10 kDa cut off; Millipore) ultra®ltration cartridge until the conductivity was below 3 mS/cm. This solution was then pumped onto a S-Sepharose ff (Pharmacia) cation-exchange column (2.5 cm Â 10 cm) at a ¯ow-rate of 10 ml/minute. The column was washed with water and the bound protein was eluted with 20 mM Tris (pH 8), 0.3 M NaCl in a step gradient (10% steps of 120 ml each). Fractions of 90-120 mM NaCl were pooled, diluted fourfold with water, the pH was adjusted to 8.5 with Tris, and the protein solution was passed over a Q-Sepharose ff (Pharmacia) anionexchange column (1.5 cm Â 5 cm) at 2 ml/minute. The column was washed with 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM CaCl2 and eluted with a linear gradient of 100 ml to 20 mM bis-Tris (pH 6.0), 1 mM CaCl2, 125 mM NaCl at 2 ml/minute. TIMP-2 containing fractions, as identi®ed by SDS-PAGE, were pooled, titrated to pH 6.0 with bisTris and applied to a ProteinPak CM HR 15 (Waters) HPLC cation exchange column (1 cm Â 10 cm), equilibrated with 10 mM bis-Tris (pH 6). TIMP-2 was eluted with a pH gradient to 10 mM Hepes (pH 8.0) over 30 minutes at 2.4 ml/minute, while NaCl was kept at 40 mM. For ®nal puri®cation, the eluate was adjusted to pH 8.5 and applied to a Protein-Pak Q HR 15 (Waters) anion-exchange column (1.6 cm Â 10 cm). The column was eluted in 10 mM bis-Tris (pH 6.9), 0.5 mM CaCl2, with a NaCl gradient from 50 mM± 80 mM over 25 minutes, at a ¯ow-rate of 4 ml/minute. The identity of the protein as full-length TIMP-2 was veri®ed by N-terminal sequencing, SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions, as well as MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (data not shown).

Crystal Structure of TIMP-2 electric focusing showed a single band at pH 6.2 (not shown). Crystallization and data collection TIMP-2 was concentrated to 10 ± 15 mg/ml and crystallized by vapor diffusion in hanging and sitting drops. Drops were made from equal volumes of the concentrated protein solution and the reservoir solution containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 M NaCl, 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400, and equilibrated against the reservoir solution at 4 C. Crystals appearing after three or four days were of insuf®cient quality for X-ray analysis, but useful as seeds for pre-equilibrated drops set up as described above. Larger crystals, suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained after three to four weeks both with macro and micro seeding, and they grew to 0.7 mm Â 0.5 mm Â 0.2 mm. Data were collected from one crystal at 100 K on a MAR image plate on beamline X11 at the EMBL Outstation (DESY, Hamburg). Space group and cell parameters were determined using the auto-indexing routine in DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) and pseudo precession images generated with the program Pattern (G. Lu, unpublished results). The X-ray data were evaluated and scaled with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Statistics of the data collection are given in Table 1. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) using a preliminary structural model of bovine TIMP-2 bound to Ê MT1-MMP (Fernandez-Catalan et al., 1998) at 2.75 A as a search model. One high peak above the background was obtained in the rotation function, irrespective of the choice of resolution interval (low-resolution cutoff varied Ê between 15 and 9 A, high-resolution cutoff varied Ê Ê between 5 and 3. A) or of integration radius (15 ± 25 A). Similarly, the translation function, applied in all orthorÊ hombic primitive space groups at 2.1 A resolution, gave an unambiguous solution in P21212 with correlation 52.3 and R-factor 55.2 after rigid body re®nement. This rotation and translation gave a model that packed well in the crystal lattice. Initial re®nement and model building was carried out with the programs X-PLOR (Brunger et al., 1987) and O (Jones et al., 1991), respectively. Throughout re®nement, progress was monitored by the free R-factor. Additions to the re®nement protocol, which would lower the conventional R-factor but not Rfree, were not considered because of the possibility of over®tting the data. The re®nement procedure in X-PLOR consisted of an initial round of rigid-body re®nement. In subsequent rounds, model building was followed by simulated annealing, positional re®nement and restrained grouped B-factor re®nement. This procedure resulted in an Rfree  32.4% and R  27.5%, respectively. The ®nal steps in the re®nement were carried out using Refmac (Murshudov et al., 1997). At this stage, individual rather than grouped B-factor re®nement was employed. Water molecules were incorporated into the model using Fo À Fc electron density maps. After re®nement, solvent molecules with Ê too high a B factor (B > 60 A2) were removed. The ®nal model was analyzed with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Structure comparisons were performed using the programs TOP (Lu, 1996) and O (Jones et al., 1991). Residues were considered structurally equivalent if the distance Ê between their Ca atoms was less than 3.8 A and they were found in a consecutive stretch of three equivalent Protein Data Bank accession number

1139
residues. The structural comparisons were made using the ®nal, re®ned model of bovine TIMP-2 complexed to the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (Fernandez-Catalan et al., 1998).
