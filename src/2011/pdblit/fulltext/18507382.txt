Abstract: The copper amine oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis (AGAO) is reversibly inhibited by molecular wires comprising a Ru(II) complex head group and an aromatic tail group joined by an alkane linker. The crystal structures of a series of Ru(II)-wire-AGAO complexes differing with respect to the length of the alkane linker have been determined. All wires lie in the AGAO active-site channel, with their aromatic tail group in contact with the trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ) cofactor of the enzyme. The TPQ cofactor is consistently in its active ("off-Cu") conformation, and the side chain of the so-called "gate" residue Tyr296 is consistently in the "gate-open" conformation. Among the wires tested, the most stable complex is produced when the wire has a -(CH2)4- linker. In this complex, the Ru(II)(phen)(bpy)2 head group is level with the protein molecular surface. Crystal structures of AGAO in complex with optically pure forms of the C4 wire show that the linker and head group in the two enantiomers occupy slightly different positions in the active-site channel. Both the  and  isomers are effective competitive inhibitors of amine oxidation. Remarkably, inhibition by the C4 wire shows a high degree of selectivity for AGAO in comparison with other copper-containing amine oxidases.

Introduction

Copper amine oxidases catalyze the oxidative deamination of primary amines to the corresponding aldehyde. Their catalytic site contains a Cu atom and an organic cofactor, trihydroxyphenylalanine quinone (TPQ, Figure 1). A channel connects the active site to the molecular surface. The Cu amine oxidase of the bacterium Arthrobacter globiformis (AGAO) has been used to study the effect of molecular "wires" designed to fit into the active-site channel. Such wires typically have a "tail" group that makes contact with the active site, a "head" group that lies close to the surface of the protein, and a linker that joins them. For example, wires with a thiol head group can provide a conducting link between the enzyme active site and a gold electrode, thus enabling the electrochemistry of the active site to be explored.1 Other wires, which were originally designed to demonstrate the pathway by which substrates reach the active site, have been useful in probing mechanisms of inhibition. In wires of the latter class, a dimethylaniline (DMA) tail group is linked to a [Ru(phen)(bpy)2]2+ head group by an alkane chain (Scheme 1).2 The DMA-(CH2)n-[Ru(phen)(bpy)2]2+ wires are potent AGAO inhibitors, their potency decreasing with the

length n of the linker.2 Our hypothesis was that, by optimizing the interactions of the head group, the linker, and the activesite recognition element (tail group) with the enzyme, wires could be obtained that selectively inhibit AGAO in the presence of other amine oxidases. If successful, this approach may lead to the rational design of molecular wires that selectively inhibit amine oxidases in therapeutically relevant contexts. We have made progress toward this goal by determining the crystal structure of the complex between AGAO and [DMA-(CH2)4-Ru(phen)(bpy)2]2+.2 In this complex, the wire occupies the hydrophobic channel to the active site, the DMA tail group is in contact with the TPQ cofactor, and the Ru head group lies at the molecular surface. The structure analysis left three features for further study. First, the electron density of the linker between the DMA and [Ru(phen)(bpy)2]2+ groups was discontinuous. Second, the electron density at the Ru head group was not sufficiently strong and defined to permit the phen and bpy ligands to be modeled. Third, electron-density and anomalous scattering difference maps consistently had two peaks attributable to the Ru atom, instead of the expected single peak. Since [Ru(phen)(bpy)2]2+ is chiral, and since the crystals were prepared with a racemic mixture of the wire enantiomers, it was suggested that the Ru atom occupies slightly different positions depending on its chirality. We now report high-resolution structures of two AGAO-wire complexes prepared from purified enantiomers of the

[DMA-(CH2)n-Ru(phen)(bpy)2]2+ wire with n ) 4, and structures of AGAO-wire complexes with longer linkers (n ) 5-11). In addition, we report the results of kinetics experiments comparing both the resolved enantiomers and the racemate of [DMA-(CH2)4-Ru(phen)(bpy)2]2+ as inhibitors of AGAO and four other copper-containing amine oxidases. Taken together, the findings shed new light on the factors controlling the recognition of these unique inhibitors by bacterial amine oxidases.
Materials and Methods Preparation of Molecular Wires: General. The racemic DMA-Cn-Ru(phen)(bpy)2 wires with n ) 5, 6, 7, 9, and 11, as well as the ligand 4-(m-(CH2)4-OC6H4NMe2)-phen, were prepared by published methods.2 The preparation of the - and -C4 wires was based on a procedure developed by Hua and von Zelewsky for [Ru(phen)(bpy)2]X2.3 Enantiomeric tartrate salts of [Ru(bpy) 2 py 2 ] 2+ , [-Ru(bpy) 2 py 2 ][(-)-O,O-dibenzoyl- L tartrate] · 12H2O and [-Ru(bpy)2py2][(+)-O,O-dibenzoyl-Dtartrate] · 12H2O, were isolated as single crystals. Reaction of the tartrate salts with 4-(m-(CH2)4-OC6H4NMe2)-phen then yielded the enantiomeric C4 wires. Details of the procedures are given below. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of 58-59 µM solutions in MeCN (A456 ) 0.90-0.92) were recorded on an Aviv model 62A spectropolarimeter. The enantiomeric purity of the - and -enantiomers was estimated as g90% by comparing the CD spectra (Figure S1, Supporting Information) with the spectrum of [-Ru(phen)(bpy)2]X2.3 All manipulations involving enantiopure ruthenium complexes and reagents were performed in the dark under an argon atmosphere.

Crystallization of AGAO and Formation of AGAO-Wire Complexes. AGAO was purified as described previously.4 Crystals of AGAO were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Each drop contained protein (2 µL, 10 mg/mL) and an equal volume of a well solution comprising ammonium sulfate (0.6-1.1 M) and sodium citrate (0.15 M), pH 6-7.5. Crystals appeared after several weeks at ambient temperature (22 °C). Cryoprotection of the crystals and addition of wire were performed simultaneously, as follows: Well solution was added gradually to the drop until the drop volume reached 20 µL. The drop was transferred to a sitting-drop platform, and the volume was increased to 30 µL. Half of the solution was then replaced stepwise with a series of well solutions containing a <10-fold stoichiometric excess of wire and 5% increments of glycerol. This step was carried out 12 times, twice for each increment in glycerol concentration from 5 to 30% v/v. The equilibrations were generally performed over a 24-h period, with the first equilibration taking at least 12 h. Practical considerations prevented the use of strictly identical procedures for the various AGAO-wire complexes. The crystals were flash-frozen in a stream of N2 gas at 100 K. X-ray Data. Diffraction images were recorded on a Mar345 image-plate detector using Cu KR X-rays ( ) 1.5418 Å) from an in-house Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode generator with Osmic mirror optics (Auburn Hills, MI). Diffraction data were indexed and scaled using the HKL software suite.5 Crystal Structure Refinements. The starting model for the refinement of all the structures was the native AGAO structure refined at 1.55 Å resolution.6 The model was first stripped of solvent, metal ions, sulfate ions, and glycerol molecules. Residues with multiple conformers were assigned zero occupancy. The activesite TPQ (residue 382) was replaced by alanine. Initial lowresolution rigid-body refinement was followed by rounds of restrained refinement with translation, libration, and screw-motion (TLS) parametrization7 alternating with the inspection of electrondensity maps and manual adjustment of the model. The Cu atom was added early in the refinement, as were solvent molecules displaying good electron density and reasonable stereochemistry. Solvent molecules near the active-site channel were added later. Alternate amino acid conformers, exogenous sulfate ions, and glycerol molecules were added last, if warranted by omit maps. The TPQ cofactor was clearly defined in an "off-Cu" conformation and was inserted in place of Ala382. The wire molecule was left unmodeled in each refinement until its position was revealed by strong (though not necessarily continuous) Fobs - Fcalc electron density. This generally occurred at an advanced stage of the refinement. In the two structures containing the  and  enantiomers of the n ) 4 wire, continuous electron density unambiguously revealed the DMA group, the -(CH2)4- linker, and the Ru(phen)(bpy)2 group. In the case of the wires with n ) 5, 6, 7, 9, and 11, there were two prominent electron-density features: one was adjacent to the TPQ and represented the DMA group, while the other was in a plausible position for the Ru atom. The identification of the latter feature as representing the Ru atom was confirmed by peaks in anomalous scattering difference maps. However, the electron density between the DMA group and the Ru atom was either consistently weak and

discontinuous or nonexistent. A wire, arbitrarily chosen to have a  head group, was modeled into these features with a linker of appropriate length and refined. The electron-density difference and anomalous scattering difference maps of the wires with n ) 5, 6, 7, and 9 all had a weaker second Ru peak, which was modeled as the Ru atom of a second conformer. Since the chirality of neither Ru head group was known, the  chirality was retained. The occupancies of the DMA group and the Ru atom in each wire were varied systematically until the residual electron density was minimized. The anomalous scattering difference maps mentioned above were used to make semiquantitative comparisons among the various wire complexes. A typical map had peaks at the positions of the Cu atom, well-resolved S atoms, and the Ru atom. The peak representing the S atom of Met441 was used as a standard, since the side chain of this residue is very well ordered in all the structures. The amplitudes of the other anomalous difference peaks were then expressed as a fraction of the amplitude of the S(Met441) peak. The S(Met280) atom was represented by two weak peaks, consistent with the presence of two side-chain conformers, and the amplitude of the weaker peak gave an indication for the threshold of significance of other features in the maps. The X-ray data and refinement statistics are set out in Table 1, and the relative amplitudes of anomalous scattering peaks are given in Table 2. The coordinates and structure factors of the structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Monomer libraries for the Ru(II)phen-Cn-DMA wires were constructed using a combination of PRODRG,7 the CCP4 molecular library sketcher,8 and manual parameter adjustment. Crystallographic refinement was carried out with REFMAC5.9 The final structures were validated by using PROCHECK10 and MOLPROBITY. 11 Figures were constructed with PYMOL.12 Inhibition Experiments. Kinetics assays and absorption spectra were collected either on a Varian Cary 6000i scanning UV/vis/ NIR spectrophotometer equipped with a dual-cell Peltier accessory for temperature control or on an HP8453 photodiode array spectrophotometer equipped with a circulating temperature bath. Protein concentrations were determined using previously published extinction coefficients based on 280 nm absorbances for recombinant AGAO13 and for native sources of Escherichia coli amine oxidase (ECAO),14 pea seedling amine oxidase (PSAO),15 Pichia pastoris lysyl oxidase (PPLO),16 and bovine plasma amine oxidase (BPAO).17 Activities were determined in triplicate at each concentration of benzylamine by monitoring the production of benzaldehyde at 250 nm ( ) 12 800 M-1 cm-1) over 3 min (25 °C).18,19 For a typical assay, a 5-10 µL aliquot of enzyme was diluted into 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing

AGAO-wire complexes were prepared by "soaking", i.e., by adding a solution of wire to the solution surrounding an AGAO crystal. The AGAO crystal chosen for each experiment was the best available at the time. As a result, the complexes are distributed over two of the four known crystal forms of AGAO.6 All the racemic complexes, including the racemic AGAO-C4wire complex reported previously, were prepared from AGAO crystals of form II, whereas the two new complexes with enantiopure n ) 4 wires belong to form IV. Crystals of form II have only half of the AGAO homodimer (one protomer) in the asymmetric unit. Crystals of form IV have a larger unit cell, and their asymmetric unit includes an entire AGAO dimer (two protomers). The structures of the - and -C4-wire complexes in form IV crystals were refined without noncrystallographic symmetry restraints, so that they provide two crystallographically independent examples of the structure. In the event, there are only small differences between the structures of the two crystallographically independent protomers in both the - and -C4-wire complexes. Where our description of these complexes appears to refer to a single structure, it is in fact based on two independent sets of observations. the - and -enantiomers of the n ) 4 wire, continuous electron density unambiguously revealed the DMA tail group, the -(CH2)4- linker, and the Ru(phen)(bpy)2 head group (Figure 2). The positions of the DMA group with respect to the TPQ were effectively identical in the enantiomeric structures (Table
Structures of AGAO Complexes with Enantiomers of the C4 Wire. In the structure analyses of the AGAO complexes with

S1, Supporting Information). The C4 linker followed slightly different paths along the channel. The chiral head group was observed clearly in both structures, the phen and bpy molecules being defined better in the  structure, where the occupancy of the head group was higher (Table 2). In both protomers of the  structure, the position of the Ru atom was confirmed by a single large anomalous scattering difference peak. In one protomer, a second but much smaller impurity peak occurred at a position corresponding to the main Ru peak in the  structure. Conversely, in both protomers of the  structure, the major anomalous peak was accompanied by a minor peak attributable to the Ru atom in the  enantiomer. Stereospecific Interactions in the Active-Site Channel. The electron-density maps and models of the C4 wires were sufficiently clear to permit observations on the fit between the linkers and the active-site channel. The side chains of three residues near the entrance to the channelsGlu102, Phe105, and Leu358shave different conformations in the complexes with the  and  wires (Figure 3). The two conformers of Glu102 have different torsion angles about the C -C and C-C bonds, with the result that the positions of corresponding atoms in the carboxylate group differ by 1-2 Å. The movements of Phe105 and Leu358 are more pronounced. Phe105, the residue adjacent to Glu102 in the channel, points away from the channel in the complex with the  wire but into the channel in the complex with the  wire. The first conformer has not been observed previously, while the second is similar to those found in other structure analyses of AGAO. The side chain of Leu358, which is now resolved in two conformations, was unresolved in previous structure analyses of AGAO.

The side chains of Glu102, Phe105, and Leu358* adopt different conformations in response to the binding of the enantiomeric wires. The asterisk on L358* reminds us that this channel residue belongs to the second subunit of the dimer. The surface of the active-site channel is drawn in two colors to indicate that both protomers of the homodimeric AGAO molecule contribute to the channel.

Figure 4. Tail group of the -C4 wire in the active-site pocket of AGAO. The tail of the -C4 wire (blue) is shown inside the green "mesh" contours (2Fobs

- Fcalc difference density at 1.0), and the TPQ is shown inside the gray "mesh" contours (2Fobs - Fcalc difference density at 2.0). The active-site "gate" tyrosine (Y296) is drawn in two conformationssopen (yellow, present work) and closed (green, PDB entry 1w6g). The AGAO residues that make van der Waals contact with the linker or tail group of a wire are Phe105, Ala135, Pro136, Leu137, Trp168, Tyr296 (the gate), Tyr302, Tyr307, Leu358*, Gly380, and TPQ382. The channel residue L358* belongs to the second subunit of the dimer. An important hydrogen bond between TPQ and Tyr284 is shown as a dotted line. Water molecules displaced from the channel by the wire are shown as red spheres.The -N(CH3)2 group of the DMA (blue) is in contact with the TPQ quinone ring, which is in the "off-Cu" conformation. The gate residue, Y296, is restricted to its open conformation by the presence of the wire. In the absence of a substrate or other ligand, the gate would typically be in the closed conformation (green).

The first is the formation of a hydrogen bond between the O4 atom of the TPQ and the hydroxyl group of a conserved tyrosine, Tyr284 (Figure 4). This bond, which is not present in native AGAO structures,6 helps to stabilize the conformation of the TPQ cofactor in the presence of a C4 wire. The second observation concerns Tyr296, which has been described as a "gate" to the active site. In the structures where a C4 wire is bound, the side chain of Tyr296 nestles in a hydrophobic depression between Leu137 and Gln294 (Figure 4). In this conformation, the gate is "open". In native AGAO structures, the side chain of Tyr296 projects into the channel, and the gate is said to be "closed". In the closed-gate conformation, the hydroxyl atom O(Tyr296) is hydrogen-bonded to the first of a chain of four water molecules in the active-site pocket and channel. There is an additional water molecule in the space that will be occupied by the aromatic ring of Tyr296 when the gate opens. Thus, at least five crystallographically identified water molecules must be displaced when the conformation of the Tyr296 gate changes from closed to open.

general features as observed earlier in the structure of the racemic C4-wire complex.2 The electron density of the DMA group was consistently well resolved and in essentially the same position as in the enantiopure C4-wire complexes. In contrast, the electron density of the linker was weak and discontinuous, and the Ru head group was represented by either one or two strong electron-density peaks. The latter peaks were confirmed as Ru by being superposed on peaks in an anomalous scattering difference map (Figure 5). They lay close to the protein surface at or outside the entrance to the active-site channel and presumably indicated the preferred position of Ru head groups with opposite chiralities. At the AGAO active site, the TPQ cofactor was consistently ordered in the "off-Cu" conformation (Figure 4). Three qualitative trends in the structures of the complexes with the C5-C11 wires were noted. As the length of the wires increased, there was (with one irregularity) a systematic increase in the distance from the TPQ to the Ru peak(s) (Table 3), the quality of the wire electron density decreased, and the amplitude of the Ru peaks decreased (Table 2). The significance of these trends is mentioned later.

Inhibition Experiments. The racemic mixture of the C4 wire is known to be a potent inhibitor of benzylamine oxidation by AGAO.2 The present work shows that the resolved - and -isomers are also effective: the Ki values from the global fits are 27 ( 1 nM (racemic), 36 ( 2 nM (), and 32 ( 1 nM (), demonstrating little or no stereocontrol (Table 4, Figure 6). A competitive inhibition model (versus benzylamine) best accounts for the data for the three wires (R2 g 0.995). Significantly higher Ki values were determined for the inhibition of benzylamine oxidation using the C4 wires with all other amine oxidases. While a competitive mode of inhibition was observed for ECAO with both isomers, the Ki values were an order of magnitude larger than those for AGAO (Table 4). Further, greater enantioselectivity was observed for ECAO: the -isomer was 4 times more effective than the -isomer (Ki ) 0.27 ( 0.02 µM () and 1.10 ( 0.08 µM (), R2 g 0.992, data not shown). The racemic C4 wire was dramatically less effective against BPAO, with the data best described by a noncompetitive fit with Ki ) 44 ( 4 µM (R2 ) 0.973). No inhibition was observed for the same wire screened against either PSAO or PPLO (data not shown). It is likely that the observed inhibition patterns reflect the competition, under turnover conditions, between the inhibitor

Information). The DMA tail group is anchored primarily through hydrophobic interactions with the active-site cavity (Figure 4). The contacts between the DMA methyl groups and the O5(TPQ) atom are 3.1-3.7 Å, and the angle between the DMA and TPQ aromatic ring planes is consistently 70°. Similar contacts between the DMA tail group and the TPQ quinone ring occur in all the complexes of AGAO with a racemic C5-C11 wire.

("mixed") or only to ES ("noncompetitive"). Pure "noncompetitive" inhibition, with the inhibitor binding exclusively to the ES complex, is rare and probably represents a limiting case of mixed inhibition, where inhibitor binding to the free enzyme E makes only a minor contribution. To assess whether the charge of the head group could influence AGAO inhibition by the C4 wire, the CoIII analogue, (CoIII(bpy)2[4-(m-(CH2)4-OC6H4NMe2)-phen])(NO3)3, was evaluated. The CoIII wire was an effective inhibitor but slightly less potent than the RuII C4 wire, despite the increased positive charge. A mixed-type inhibition model best described the data, with Ki ) 120 ( 4 nM (R2 ) 0.996) (Table 4, Figure 7).
Discussion Overview of the AGAO Complexes with the Enantiomeric C4 Wires. The preparation of the optically pure enantiomers of

reported here have their TPQ in an "off-Cu" conformation. The occurrence of the TPQ cofactor in a single conformation is in contrast with the disorder that characterizes the TPQ cofactor in native AGAO.6 The off-Cu conformation has previously been observed in AGAO derivatives where the TPQ is linked covalently to an inhibitor as the result of a chemical reaction. Indeed, the TPQ must be off-Cu for the formation of a covalent link to a ligand, be it an inhibitor or a substrate during the catalytic cycle. The AGAO-wire complexes are the first CuAO complexes in which the interaction between the TPQ cofactor and an inhibitor is noncovalent. We conclude that the insertion of a foreign moleculesthe wiresthat fits into the active site is all that is required to trigger the change of the TPQ to its offCu conformation. A second protein residue that has different conformations in the absence or presence of a ligand in the active-site channel is Tyr296, the so-called "gate". When the structure of AGAO is determined in the absence of a substrate or inhibitor, the Tyr296 gate is consistently "closed". When a substrate or inhibitor is present, the closed conformation is sterically forbidden, and the gate is consistently "open". Again, the open conformation of Tyr296 is essential to permit the entry of a ligand into the active site and may well be triggered by that ligand. Since the TPQ cofactor and Tyr296 gate can each exist in two alternative conformations, there are four possible combinations. One combination is sterically forbidden, and only two of the other three have been observed in crystal structures:
Gate open closed open closed TPQ off-Cu off-Cu on-Cu on-Cu Occurrence AGAO derivatives with a ligand at active site forbidden by steric overlap permitted, but not observed native AGAO (TPQ may be disordered)

the C4 wire, - and -[DMA-C4-Ru(II)(phen)(bpy)2], has made it possible to prepare AGAO complexes with a single species of wire molecule, instead of the two species that are present in a racemic mixture. The resulting crystal structures of the AGAO complexes with the - and -C4 wires are less affected by disorder and yield the most detailed models so far for the interactions between the wire and the protein. At the head group end of the wire, the structures confirm that the position of the Ru atom in relation to the protein molecule depends on the chirality of the Ru(phen)(bpy)2 moiety. This was one of the key hypotheses in the earlier description of the racemic AGAO-C4-wire complex, where the Ru atom seemed to be represented by two peaks in electron-density maps and in anomalous scattering difference maps.2 It is now clear that the two peaks indeed corresponded to the Ru atom in the two enantiomeric components of the racemic C4 wire. The positions of the head group Ru atom in the - and -C4wire complexes differ by 3 Å. This difference ultimately stems from the enantiomeric arrangements of the bpy ligands and their interactions with protein surface residues, which cause the phen ligand in the - and -Ru(phen)(bpy)2 head groups to have different preferred positions at the entrance to the active-site channel (Figure 3). Since the linker is a side chain of the phen ligand, the position of the phen affects the positions of the atoms in the linker. Further, the changes in the position of the head group and linker are accommodated by movements of the side chains of channel residues such as Glu102, Phe105, and Leu358. At the tail end of the wire, the differences between the - and -C4-wire complexes disappear, and the interactions of the DMA tail group with the TPQ cofactor and other residues in the active-site cavity are closely similar (Table S1, Supporting

When a ligand enters the active-site channel and triggers the change to an "open gate, off-Cu TPQ" conformation, the expulsion of bound water molecules from the channel results in an entropic contribution to the driving force. Additionally, there is an enthalpic contribution from the new wire-protein contacts. The off-Cu conformation of the TPQ is further stabilized by a new hydrogen bond from the TPQ to a conserved Tyr residue, (TPQ)O4 · · · O(Tyr284). Similar hydrogen bonds occur in two earlier AGAO-inhibitor derivatives.22 (We calculate close contacts of 2.4 Å from PDB entries 1sii and 1sih). The corresponding hydrogen bond in E. coli amine oxidase, (TPQ)O4 · · · O(Tyr369), has been identified by Mure et al. as

"controlling the position and orientation of TPQ in the catalytic cycle, including optimal orientation for reactivity with substrates".23
Systematic Trends in the Linker and Head Group Regions. In the - and -C4-wire complexes, the electron

density representing the hydrocarbon linker segment of the wire is significant and continuous. In the complexes with racemic ligands, the corresponding electron density is weak or absent. As the length of the linker increases, the amplitude of the anomalous scattering difference assigned to the Ru atom decreases (Table 2). These trends can be explained as follows. First, the racemic wire complexes have at least two components with slightly different structures, so that the electron density is weakened by disorder. Accordingly, in comparison with the - and -C4 wires, the electron density of the racemic C5-C11 wires is observably weaker. Second, the longer the linker segment of the wire, the less the Ru head group is restrained; the weaker the restraints on the Ru head group, the greater is the disorder in the linker segment. While the distance from the enzyme active site to the Ru head group increases with the length of the linker segment (the C7 wire being slightly out of order), the interactions between the head group and residues on the protein surface vary from wire to wire. Each Ru head group finds its own preferred position(s). Third, the C4-wire complexes have a structural advantage, since the Ru head group is approximately level with the boundary of the AGAO molecule. Regardless of whether it is  or , the head group fits into the end of the active-site channel, rather like a cork might fit into a bottle. The head group makes tight contacts with several of the nearest-neighbor protein residues. In the longer wires, such favorable complementarity is missing.
[DMA-Cn-Ru(phen)bpy)2] Wires as Specific Amine Oxidase Inhibitors. In earlier work, we showed that wires of

potential interactions between the protein and the linker or the DMA tail group are predominantly hydrophobic (Figure 4). The situation is complicated by the facts that the related enzyme ECAO discriminates between the  and  enantiomers of the C4 wire more effectively than AGAO, but that the inhibition is only 10% as effective. The racemic C4 wire inhibits another related enzyme, BPAO, even less effectively, and two other related enzymes, PSAO and PPLO, are not inhibited at all. In the absence of relevant crystal structures, we speculate that all these observations may be explained by considering the active-site channel of each enzyme. The reduced effectiveness of the - and -C4 wires as inhibitors of ECAO and the enhanced ability of ECAO to discriminate between the wire enantiomers may both be symptoms of a sterically more restrictive active-site channel. The active-site channel in PSAO may be sterically so restrictive that the wire is not bound; conversely, the wide-open active-site channel in PPLO16,24 may simply fail to provide sufficient specific interactions with the wire to cause effective binding and inhibition. The active-site channel in BPAO is also considered to be wide, but it is omitted from this discussion since some relevant residues are disordered in the molecular model.25
Further Comments on the Importance of the Wire Head Group. Finally, the present work shows that head-group

the type [DMA-Cn-Ru(phen)bpy)2] are powerful inhibitors of AGAO.2 The kinetics measurements in Results now provide evidence that the inhibition of AGAO by the [DMA-C4-Ru(phen)bpy)2] wire is competitive. The most straightforward explanation of such inhibition is that the binding of the wire prevents access by substrate amines to the active site, consistent with the structural findings. However, some aspects of the inhibition deserve further comment. Since AGAO discriminates structurally between the enantiomers of the C4 wire, it is surprising that the  and  enantiomers and the racemic form of the C4 wire have approximately the same effectiveness as inhibitors of amine oxidation. In other words, the effectiveness of the wire as an inhibitor is independent of the chirality of the Ru(phen)bpy)2] head group, implying that the chiral Ru head group does not control what happens in the rest of the wire molecule. To understand the function of the wire, we have to concentrate on the linker and the DMA tail group and on their relationships to residues lining the active-site channel and pocket of the enzyme. The alkane linker segment of the wire responds to the steric restrictions within the active-site channel, while the contacts between the DMA tail group and residues in the active-site pocket are identical or closely similar in all the complexes of AGAO and a [DMA-Cn-Ru(phen)bpy)2] wire. When AGAO is complexed with the enantiopure - and -C4 wires, the

electrostatic charge does not play a major role in wire binding. A search of the structures of all the racemic wire complexes shows that the protein side chains closest to the Ru atom are consistently Glu102 (at 5-10 Å), Glu106 (at 7-11 Å), and Arg336 (at 8-11 Å). In the structures of the - and -C4-wire complexes, the [Ru(phen)(bpy)2]2+ head group is packed against the protein. The occupancy of the Ru head group is higher when the nearest neighbors are Glu102 and Arg336 (total charge 0) than when they are Glu102 and Glu106 (total charge -2), suggesting that side-chain electrostatic charges make relatively unimportant contributions to the head group/protein interactions. Consistent with these observations, the C4 wire with a CoIII head group is slightly less effective as an inhibitor of AGAO than the same wire with a RuII head group, despite the increased positive charge. From a design standpoint, it is likely that the effectiveness of a metal in a wire inhibitor depends less on the oxidation state of the metal than on the size, shape, and inertness of the resulting head group, as well as the contribution that the head group makes to the solubility of the wire.
Conclusions

Molecular wires of the form [DMA-Cn-Ru(phen)(bpy)2]2+ are powerful competitive inhibitors of AGAO. A wire with n ) 4 is particularly effective: when its DMA tail group occupies the active-site pocket, its Ru head group neatly plugs the entrance to the active-site channel. The enzyme discriminates structurally between the  and  enantiomers of the wire: In the crystal structures of the - and -C4-wire complexes with AGAO, the chiral Ru head group occupies different positions with respect to the protein surface, and there are small differences between the conformations of the alkane linker segment. These properties of the C4-wire complexes help to rationalize our observations on the complexes of AGAO with

longer wires and on the complexes of the C4 wire with several other copper amine oxidases. In summary, we report that inhibition by a "wire-type" compound can be remarkably selective and that the selectivity is created by multiple interactions between the inhibitor and the enzyme. There are strong indications that the critical interactions are located within the active-site cavity and the active-site channel. Thus, the composition and dimensions of the tail group and linker of the wire have to complement the dimensions, shape, and surface properties of the cavity and channel of the protein. These are useful clues for the design of inhibitors with therapeutic applications. In the long term, many such applications depend on the ability to inhibit an enzyme in a pathogen without inhibiting analogous enzymes in the host. Since access to the active site of many enzymes is provided by a sterically restrictive channel, a strategy that exploits the

structural properties of such channels in the design of specific inhibitors may be widely applicable.
