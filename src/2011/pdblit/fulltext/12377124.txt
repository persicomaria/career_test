aUnit~ Prot~ines and ~Unit~ d'Encymologte, Statton de Recherches Laiti~res, I N R A 78352, Jouy-en Josas Cedex, France Received 8 October 1992 The active site ser, ne of the X-prolyl dipept~dyl ammopcptidase from Lactococcus lactzs (PepX) was identified. The enzyme was labeled by [~H]DFP, treated by CNBr and the resulting pepUdes were separated by reverse-phase-HPLC. The mum rad~olabeled peptide was sequenced. Ser-348, in the following sequence, Gly-L~s-Ser-Tyr-Leu-Gly, was identified as the active site serme. A sequen¢~ comparison between the active site of l"epX and other serme proteases was made, ~howing only limited ~equence homologies m this area. The consensus sequence surrounding the active site ~grine in the three known X-prolyl dipeptidyl ammopeptidases (mammalian DPPIV, :)'eastDPAB and PcpX) is G-X-S-Y-X-G, where X is a non-conserved amino acid.

AND METHODS

2.1. Purification of PepX Th~ enzyme was purified according to [2]. The starting material was a crude powder of Lactococcus lactts obtained from Imperial laiotech (UK). After purification, the enzyme was dialyr~.'d and concentrated against 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.0, using a Centrieon 30 mlcroconcentrator (Amicon, USA). 2.2. Sequencing of the amitlo.termitms of P~7>X "i'h~ pttrl~ed enzyme (10~) pmo~) was submitted to SDS-PAGE I9] and was blotted onto PVDF membrane (Applied Bio~ystems) [10]. After Coomassie blue staining, the hand corresponding to PepX was cut out and placed m the cartridge of an Applied Biosystems Model 477 A liquid pulse phase ~'quencer w~th on line analysis of PTHderivatives, 2.3. Active site labehag The enzyme (200/,tg, 2.3 nmol) was incubat~.d at room temperature for I h with 6.66 MBq of [~Id]DFP (370 GB~t/mmol; NEN) i~ ~0~ul of 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7 0 Unlabeled DFP was then added rote the reaction mixture at a final concentrat,on of I mM and the incubation was continued at 4°C for 24 h The unreacted DFP was removed by dlalysm and the sample was dried with a Speed-Vac concentrator. %#, C I . ~ ~ C.~..

The flow rate was 1 ml/min and the absorbanee of the eluate was monitored at 214 nm. Fractions were collected each minute. The radioactivity distribution was determined by counting 20/~1 of each fraction in a liquid scintillation counter Beckman LSi701. 2.6. Sequencingof the labeledpepttde Fractions exhtbmng the major radioactivity were pooled and dried. They were dissolved in 0.115% TFA and Loaded on the sequencer. Only 50 ~l out of the total 150 pl conver~mn product obtain~ after each step of the Edman degradation were injected for identification of the PTH denvat,.ve.The remaining sample (100pl) was used for the determination of the rad~oact~wtydmtnbution 2.7. Othermethods The actwity of PepX wa~ assayed with Ala-Pro-paranttroandidc as a sub~trate [2]. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (P~erce)ruth bovine scram albummc as a standard. Elect,ophoresis of the DFP-labelcd enzyme was performed according to [9] and Coomassie blue R250 was a~edfor the staining. The ~el was then soaked in Enhancer (Dupont). dried and fluorographed.

3.1. Purity and labeling of PepX
Because the starting material was a commercial lactic acid bacteria extract, it was necessary to check that the X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase we purified was PepX. First, we showed that the substrate specificity of our enzyme was similar to that o f the previously purified PepX [2,4] (data not shown). Second, o u r enzyme was found to be made o f two subunits with identical apparent M W of 83 k D a by S D S - P A G E (Fig. 1). This value is very close to those previously found by [2] (85 kDa) and [4] (82-83 kDa). Third, we have sequenced the first twelve residues o f our e n z y m e and they were identical to those found for PepX [6]. Therefore we can conclude that the enzyme purified from the commercial powder is PepX. The purified enzyme was labeled with [3H]DFP and a fraction of the reaction mixture was electrophoresed. After Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 1A), a single band o f 83 k D a was visible. After fluorography (Fig. 1B), a radioactive band was perfectly superimposed on the stained band. This shows that the labeled band corresponds to PepX. 3.2. Sequence determination of the active site peptide The [3H]DFP-labeled PepX was cleaved with cyanogen bromide and the resulting peptides were separated hy reverse-phase HPLC. (Fig. 2A). Radioactivity was counted in each fraction. O n e major radioactive peak, well separated from the others, containing 55% of the total recovered radioactivity was found (Fig. 2B). This iJ,~,,at,,,L was scqtlcnccd. The ·,.,.vw,n~ sequence ¢,,,m_. : major ~.^a.... was obtained: Thr-Oly-Lys-X-Tyr-Leu-Gly-Thr- (with X representing an unidentified residue). This sequence is identical to the sequence Thr-345 to Thr-352 o f PepX, 140

with a Ser in position 348 corresponding to the unidentiffed residue in fourth position o f the sequenced peptide. Moreover, counting the radioactivity released at each step o f the E d m a n degradation showed that the fourth residue is bearing the tritium label. These results indicate that Ser-348 is modified by [3H]DFP and is therefore the active site serine. The remaining 45% o f the recovered radioactivity were present in several minor peaks. They correspond most probably to partial cleavages o f the protein by CNBr. Indeed, 6 M e t - T h r bonds which are known to be poorly cleaved by CNBr [11], are present in PepX out o f 12 M e t - X bonds. Two o f these bonds preceeds the active site and their incomplete cleavage could lead to radioactive cleavage products o f various sizes. Determination o f the N-terminal a m i n o acid sequence o f the peptide contained in the second radioactive peak (corresponding to 15% o f the recovered radioactivity) (Fig. 2A) confirmed this hypothesis. This peptide starts at Thr-311 and its labeling probably results from absence o f cleavage at Met-344-Thr-345 bond. 3.3. Comparison with other serine pretenses The sequence surrounding the active site serine in PepX, G-K-S-Y-L, was c o m p a r e d with that found in other serine proteases. This sequence differs from the one found in the enzymes o f the trypsin family (G-D-S~J'%J] or oh LAI~*

[12]. It does not correspond either to the general consensus G-X-S-X-MS, given for the serine pretenses of the subtilisin ar.d carboxypeptidase Y families [13]. The active site sequence of PepX was then compared with that of DPPIV, a mammalian serine pretense with X-prolyl-dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity, which does not pre~ent overall sequence homology with any o f the three families of serine proteases mentioned above. The active site serine of DPPIV was found in the fo u .... ; - - sequence: G-W-S-Y-G-G rILe° DPPIV has ........ = L" %1 been proposed to be classified in a new family o f serine proteases related to prolyl endopeptidase [15]. This family is defined on the basis of some resemblance in the

C-terminal part of the proteins and an active site motif: G-X-S-X-G-G is present in all of them (Table I). However, this motif is not found in PepX. Moreover, the active site of the PepX is not located at the C-terminal part of the protein (Table I). The second Gly of the pattern, absent in PepX and replaced by Leu, has been shown to be necessary for DPPIV activity by site-directed mutagenesis [14]. On the opposite, the third Gly of the motif is retained in PepX, suggest i n g a possible role in the active site of all these enzymes. The T y r residue tollowing the catalytic Set is conserved in DPPIV and PepX as well as in yeast DPAB [16] which possesses the same enzymatic specificity. Interestingly, 141
