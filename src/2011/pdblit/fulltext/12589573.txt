A novel iron centre in the split-Soret cytochrome c from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774

Abstract The facultative sulfate/nitrate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 harbours a split-Soret cytochrome c. This cytochrome is a homodimeric protein, having two bis-histidinyl c-type haems per monomer. It has an unique architecture at the haem domain: each haem has one of the coordinating histidines provided by the other monomer, and in each monomer the haems are parallel to each other, almost in van der Waals contact. This work reports the cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding for this cytochrome and shows, by transcriptional analysis, that it is more expressed in nitrate-grown cells than in sulfate-grown ones. In addition, the gene-deduced amino acid sequence revealed two new cysteine residues that could be involved in the binding of a non-haem iron centre. Indeed, the presence of a novel type of an iron-sulfur centre (possibly of the [2Fe-2S] type) was demonstrated by EPR spectroscopy, and putative models for its localization and structure in the cytochrome molecule are proposed on the basis of the so-far-known 3D crystallographic structure of the aerobically purified split-Soret cytochrome, which lacks this centre.

Introduction
The dimeric di-haem split-Soret cytochrome c was first isolated from the soluble fraction of the sulfate/nitrate reducer Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 (Dd27k) by LeGall and co-workers [1]. They reported that although present in nitrate- or sulfate-grown cells, a lower yield of cytochrome was purified from cells cultured under sulfate-respiring conditions. So far, the split-Soret cytochrome c (Ssc) was only isolated from this organism, in spite of the large number of haem-containing proteins found in all the sulfate-reducing bacteria belonging to the Desulfovibrio genus [1, 2, 3, 4]. The name of this cytochrome derives from the unusual split observed in the Soret band (420 nm, with a shoulder at 415 nm) of the ferrocytochrome. The only other proteins known to contain a similar feature are the cytochrome c554 from Nitrosomonas europaea [5] and the cytochrome bc complex from Rhodothermus marinus [6]. The split-Soret cytochrome c is a homodimeric protein of 51.5 kDa containing two haems per monomer [1, 7] and the preliminary model for its three-dimensional structure revealed that the protein has unique structural features [7]: in each monomer the two haem groups are almost parallel and nearly stacked on top of each other; in the dimer molecule, the four haems are in close proximity, the shortest distance between the haem iron atoms of each ° monomer being only 9 A, which results in a compact haem cluster arrangement. Furthermore, one of the axial ligands of each haem is provided by a histidine residue from the polypeptide chain of the other monomer. The available amino acid sequence of Dd27k Ssc [8] showed that each monomer of the mature cytochrome is composed of a polypeptide chain of 247 amino acids

containing eight cysteine residues. Four cysteine residues are involved in two typical CxxCH haem binding motifs and it was suggested that the remaining cysteine residues (Cys29, Cys44, Cys147 and Cys155) were involved in the binding of a [2Fe-2S] cluster, although clear evidence for the presence of such a cluster has not been reported [8]. In the present work, the gene encoding the Dd27k Ssc was cloned and sequenced. Northern analyses demonstrated that the split-Soret cytochrome c gene is transcribed as a monocistronic operon and that the level of its mRNA is considerably lower in sulfate-grown Dd27k cells. When compared with the previously published sequence [8], the gene-derived amino acid sequence presented differences that were proved to be structurally important. Furthermore, the existence of a non-haem iron centre in this protein was demonstrated by EPR spectroscopy, and models for its structure are proposed on the basis of the available 3D crystallographic structure of this cytochrome.

nomics.com/GOLD/). Secondary structure predictions were done using PSIPRED v2.1 (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/). The three-dimensional model for the putative protein from the sulfatereducing archaeon A. fulgidus, AF0016 [15], was obtained from Swiss Model (http://www.expasy.ch/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL. html) [16, 17, 18] using as template the 3D structure of the aerobic form of Ssc [7]. In order to avoid errors related to deviations between the model and its template structure [18, 19, 20, 21], other independent programs were also utilized for the prediction of the secondary and tertiary structures, yielding identical results (data not shown).

Transcriptional analysis Two synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to Dd27k ssc were used (5¢-GGAGGGAATTCATGAACATCGG3¢ and 5¢-CGGGCAAAGGATCCTATCACA-3¢) in a PCR amplification using Pfu polymerase and k1.1.3 phagic DNA. The PCR product (877 bp) was cloned into previously digested EcoRV-pZErO-1, yielding plasmid pZSsc2 and transformed in E. coli XL2-Blue cells. After isolation, pZSsc2 was linearized with EcoRI and used as template to generate a homologous anti-sense DIG-RNA probe, following the DIG-RNA Labeling Kit (SP6/T7) protocol (Roche Applied Science). Total RNA was extracted (Qiagen RNeasy extraction kit) from the mid-log phase of Dd27k cells grown anaerobically with lactate/nitrate or lactate/sulfate. RNAs were dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water and quantity and purity determined by UV spectrophotometry at 260 and 280 nm. Size fractionation of the total RNAs (2 lg) was carried out by electrophoresis on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose (Seakem LE from FMC) gel in 0.7% (v/v) formaldehyde, using a RNA ladder (0.24­9.5 kb) from Gibco Invitrogen. The 23S and 16S ribosomal bands confirmed the integrity and the amount of RNA loaded (Fig. 1B). RNAs were then transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Roche Applied Science), and hybridization, using the previously prepared DIG-RNA ssc probe, was carried out according to the DIG System protocols (Roche Applied Science). In order to quantify the effect of the growth media on the relative amount of the split-Soret mRNA, the autoradiographs were subjected to scanning densitometry (Molecular Dynamics-Computing Densitometer) and bands intensities were quantified using the ImageQuant v3.1 program.

Materials and methods
Cloning and sequencing of the D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774 split-Soret cytochrome c gene Concert DNA Purification Systems from Gibco Invitrogen, the restriction enzymes and DIG Nonradioactive Nucleic Acid Labeling, Hybridization and Detection System from Roche Applied Science were used. General techniques for DNA manipulation were performed according to standard protocols [9]. Considering the Desulfovibrio codon usage [10], a pair of degenerated oligonucleotides was designed for the amino acid sequence near the N-terminal (YDGYWYKGF) and the C-terminal (KWCYENKIE) regions of the Dd27k Ssc [8]. A PCR product with 384 base pairs (bp) was then amplified from Dd27k genomic DNA extracted (as described in [9]) from cells grown under nitrate-respiring conditions [11]. For sequencing purposes the generated DNA fragment was purified, end repaired with Klenow polymerase, ligated to SmaI digested/dephosphorylated pUC19, yielding pUSsc1, and transformed in Escherichia coli JM109 cells. Plasmid pUSsc1 was then isolated, sequenced with the ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE Biosystems) and analysed on an Applied Biosystems 377A DNA Sequencer. Since the results confirmed the cloning of the partial Dd27k split-Soret cytochrome gene, this homologous fragment was random-primed DIG-labelled and used as a probe to screen a previously constructed k-DASH genomic library of Dd27k. Plaque hybridization allowed the identification of two phages that contained the split-Soret cytochrome gene (named phages k1.1.3 and k1.2.2). Phage DNAs were isolated (Qiagen Lambda Maxi Kit) and sequenced, revealing the complete split-Soret cytochrome gene sequence, which was deposited in the GenBank sequence database under the accession number AF465622. Multiple sequence alignment with hierarchical clustering [12] and the Genetics Computer Group (Wisconsin) package provided by the Portuguese EMBnet Node (PEN) and Neural Networks for Promoter Prediction [13] were used to analyse the nucleotide sequence. The BLAST network service at NCBI was used for searching of homologous sequences and the Clustal X program [14] allowed the amino acid sequence alignments. Search on the sequence database of D. vulgaris Hildenborough, D. desulfuricans G20, Desulfitobacterium hafniense DCB-2, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 ATCC 700550 and Archaeoglobus fulgidus genomes were done at the Institute for Genomic Research (http://www.tigr.org) or at GOLD, the Genomes Online Database (http://wit.integratedge-

Purification of the D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774 split-Soret cytochrome c Cell growth The Dd27k cells were grown on a lactate/nitrate medium as previously described [1, 11]. Cells were broken in a French Press at 9000 psi and centrifuged 30 min at 10,000xg to separate the cell debris, yielding the crude extract. The crude extract was ultracentrifuged at 160,000xg, for 1 h, and the supernatant (soluble extract) decanted. For the preparation of the anaerobic cell-free extract, all the previous steps were done under an argon atmosphere [22]. Protein purification The purification procedures were performed at 4 °C and pH 7.6: 1. Anaerobic purification was done in a Coy anaerobic chamber model A-2463. The anaerobically prepared soluble extract (800 mL) was loaded at 1 mL/min on a DEAE-52 column (6·39 cm) previously equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, and a two-step (2 L each) linear gradient, 10­250 mM Tris-HCl and 250­400 mM Tris-HCl, was applied. A fraction containing

This fraction was then applied on a hydroxyapatite column (3·30 cm) (flow rate of 0.6 mL/min), equilibrated with 300 mM Tris-HCl. The column was eluted using a 0.5 L descending linear gradient (250 mM to 1 mM) of Tris-HCl, followed by a 1 L ascending linear gradient of 1­300 mM potassium phosphate buffer. The fraction containing the Ssc was eluted at ca. 150 mM phosphate and concentrated in a Diaflo apparatus (Amicon, Danvers, Mass., USA) with a YM3 membrane. This fraction was further purified through two passages on a Superdex-75 column (XK16/60; flow rate 0.5 mL/min). 2. For aerobic purification the aerobically prepared soluble extract was loaded on a DEAE fast-flow column, previously equili-

brated with 5 mM Tris-HCl. A linear NaCl gradient (0.05­1 M) was then applied and the fraction containing the Ssc was eluted at 0.3 M. This fraction was then dialysed overnight in a 3 kDa cut-off tube against 5 mM Tris-HCl buffer, and loaded on a Q-Sepharose column, equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl. This column was eluted with a 0­1 M NaCl linear gradient. The fraction containing the protein (eluted at 0.25 M) was subsequently loaded on a HTP column equilibrated with 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer and eluted with a 0­1 M potassium phosphate linear gradient. The desired fraction was eluted at 0.2 M, concentrated in a Diaflo apparatus with a YM3 membrane and finally loaded on a Superdex-75 column (XK16/60; flow rate 0.5 mL/min) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl. The purity of the anaerobic and aerobic Ssc fractions was confirmed by SDS-PAGE.

Chemical analysis and pyridine-hemochrome Haem content was determined by pyridine-haemochrome using the molar absorptivity eR-O,550­535=23.97 mM)1 cm)1 for the c-type pyridine-haemochrome [23]. Non-haem iron content was chemically determined by the 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine (TPTZ) method [24].

363 Spectroscopic analysis EPR spectra were measured on a Bruker ESP 380 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments continuous-flow helium cryostat. UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1603 spectrophotometer. EPR spectra were simulated as described [25], using spectra obtained under non-saturating conditions. Spectra of the reduced cytochrome and of appropriate standards (copper nitrate and myoglobin azide solutions) were recorded under non-saturating conditions and quantitated by double integration of the experimental spectra and of the respective theoretical simulations. Refinement of the 3D structure of the D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774 split-Soret cytochrome c The preliminary model of the three-dimensional structure obtained previously [7] was edited according to the first published ° sequence data [8]. Refinement at 2.5 A resolution using diffraction data obtained earlier from the aerobically purified and crystallized protein [7] was carried out with program X-PLOR [26]. Two-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were used between the four independent molecules in the asymmetric unit: the two molecules in each dimer were treated as different but were NCS-related to the corresponding molecule in the other dimer. In all refinements and map calculations with X-PLOR a bulk solvent correction was used and all low-resolution data were included. Prior to the refinement calculations, a random 5% sample of the reflection data was flagged for R-free calculation [27]. All model interactive visualization and editing was carried out using TURBO [28]. An initial simulated annealing refinement was carried out at 3000 K, followed by refinement of positional parameters and individual restrained B-factors were refined for non-hydrogen atoms. The model was then improved by manual adjustments to | | the electron density, using 2|Fo|)|Fc|, |Fo|)|Fc| maps and simu| lated annealed omit maps. In the final refinement stages the model was further corrected according to the newly determined Ssc sequence (see above) and a total of 188 water molecules was included. The original residue numbering scheme was kept, according to the mature protein, and ignoring the 32 residues in the signal peptide. This refinement converged to values of R and Rfree of 19.9% and 26.4%, respectively. The final refinement results and statistics are shown in Table 1. The final model coordinates as well as the structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank [30], with accession codes 1h21 and r1h21sf, respectively.

Results and discussion
Dd27k split-Soret cytochrome: features of the nucleotide gene sequence and analysis of the complete amino acid sequence The sequencing of part of the phage k1.1.3 isolated from the Dd27k genomic library (GenBank AF465622) was shown to contain the ssc coding unit (840-nt). Located 6-bp upstream of the ssc start codon a ribosome binding site-like sequence is observed, which is preceded by a nucleotide sequence that has a high probability of acting as the promoter region (between nt-9 and -54). Downstream of the ssc stop codon, a predicted stem-loop structure that may serve as a rho -independent transcription terminator signal is also detected. The Dd27k split-Soret cytochrome c gene encodes a 279 amino acid precursor polypeptide, carrying a signal peptide of 32 amino acid residues. The genededuced amino acid sequence differs by three residues from the one previously reported [8], namely Glu2 (previously Gln), Cys86 (previously Tyr) and Cys171 (previously Ala). The fact that positions 86 and 171 harbour cysteine residues had strong implications on the analysis of the 3D structure (see below). A BLAST search in the nucleotide/protein databases revealed that Dd27k Ssc potential homologues are present in D. desulfuricans G20 (54% identity and 64% similarity), Desulfitobacterium hafniense DCB-2 (31% identity and 46% similarity) and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 ATCC 700550 (23% identity and 40% similarity) (Fig. 1). Dd27k Ssc also shares some degree of similarity with a hypothetical protein (AF0016) present in the sulfate-reducing thermophilic archaeon A. fulgidus [15], as previously noted [8]. This is a particularly interesting case, since the A. fulgidus protein is

the only one that lacks the two c-type haem binding motifs (CxxCH) present in the C-terminal region of Dd27k Ssc, but contains some of the cysteine residues that in the split-Soret cytochrome c are predicted to bind the [2Fe-2S] centre. In addition, the 3D structure of the aerobic form of Dd27k Ssc and the one predicted for the A. fulgidus protein share relevant similarities (see below).

EPR studies of the aerobically and anaerobically purified Dd27k split-Soret cytochrome c The Dd27K Ssc was purified to homogeneity, both aerobically and anaerobically, yielding a single band on SDS-PAGE at 27 kDa. The non-haem iron content, determined in relation to the haem content obtained by the pyridine-haemochromogen method, shows that the aerobically purified protein contains a lower non-haem iron content (0.8 atoms Fe/per monomer) when compared with the one determined for the anaerobically purified protein (1.4 Fe atoms/per monomer). The two preparations exhibit identical visible spectra in both the oxidized and reduced states (data not shown). The EPR spectra of the oxidized states are also identical, with g-values identical to the ones previously reported [1]. However, upon reduction with sodium dithionite, resonances at g %2.01, 1.95 and 1.89 are observed (Fig. 3A). These signals are detected

Expression of the split-Soret cytochrome c gene A unique transcript of $900 bp was observed in all RNAs analysed (Fig. 2A), confirming that ssc is transcribed as a monocistronic operon. Although ssc was expressed during both nitrate and sulfate growth, the densitometric analyses of the Northern blots revealed that the level of its mRNA was significantly lower in sulfate-grown cells of Dd27k. Considering as 100% the level of ssc mRNA in Dd27k nitrate-grown cells, sulfate-grown cells contained only 9% of ssc mRNA (Fig. 2C). This result contrasts, for example, with that obtained for the Dd27k nine-haem operon, for which the level of the mRNA was $70% lower in nitrate-grown cells [31]. It should also be noted that the present result agrees with previous data reporting that the yield of the split-Soret cytochrome c isolated from sulfate-grown cells was lower when compared with the yield obtained from nitrate-grown cells [1].

at least up to 50 K, with only negligible line broadening, and at 21 K the power for half saturation is 3.5 mW. These relaxation properties are characteristic of reduced iron-sulfur centres of the [2Fe-2S] type. The gmax resonance shows an apparent hyperfine splitting of approximately 20 mT, and indeed the EPR spectrum could be simulated assuming a hyperfine interaction with an I=1 nucleus, leading to a well-resolved triplet at g=2.004 (Fig. 3B). However, at this stage, this interpretation of the EPR spectrum is presented just as a hypothesis, since, mainly due to the cluster instability, it is not possible to exclude that the apparent splitting may result from the superposition of multiple slightly different conformations of the iron centre; nevertheless, it should be noted that the spectra do not change their lineshape, apart from saturation at very low temperatures or very high microwave power. Also, since this putative splitting was not observed in all samples, it most probably would not be due to an intrinsic protein ligand (in agreement with the structural prediction, see below). The reduction potential of this centre appears to be quite low. In fact, redox titrations up to pH 9 (monitored by EPR spectroscopy and performed anaerobically in the presence of redox mediators and using sodium dithionite as reductant) did not lead to the complete reduction of the centre, showing that at, for example, pH 8 its reduction potential is lower than $­500 mV. In agreement with this result, EPR quantification of the cluster spectrum does not yield a stoichiometric value of the amount of reduced cluster in relation to the non-haem iron content, in either the anaerobic or aerobic preparations (values lower than 0.5 spin per monomer were obtained for the anaerobically purified sample, which has the highest iron content). The low amount of iron observed for the aerobically purified protein strongly indicates that this cluster is quite sensitive to oxygen exposure, thus explaining why so far it has been so difficult to prove its presence. The centre now observed probably corresponds to the one proposed earlier on the basis of Mossbauer spectra of the aerobically purified cyto¨ chrome, which displayed in the oxidized form a

Overall, and excluding the obvious differences due to the lack of sequence information, the refined threedimensional structure of Ssc is very similar to the preliminary model [7]. The main difference was that the initial model was three residues shorter, with two missing residues (Lys20 and Ser164) being located in loop regions for which the electron density maps were less clear and the terminal Pro 247 was not modelled, also due to unclear electron density. As shown in Fig. 4, Ssc is a cytochrome with a most unusual fold. First, the haem groups are located at one end of the molecule rather than being tightly wrapped by the polypeptide chain. Second, they display a stacking arrangement that was interpreted as the origin of the characteristic splitting of the Soret band in the UV-visible spectrum of the reduced protein. Ssc was the first reported example of such a haem stacking arrangement, which has since been found in other structures (see for example [5, 36]). Finally, the second axial histidine ligand of the iron atom in the haem groups of one monomer in the dimer is actually provided by a histidine residue from the other monomer, a clear evidence that the dimer is the functional unit of Ssc. Calculations with AREAIMOL [37] show

that over 36% of the total molecular surface of each ° ° monomer, i.e. 4,942 A2 in 13,640 A2, are buried by the dimerization process. Figure 5a shows an overall view of the molecule, and includes the residue and haem numbering scheme, while Fig. 5b shows a close-up view of the haem core and surroundings, which further highlights the above discussion. Correlation of the three-dimensional structure of the aerobic form of the D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774 split-Soret cytochrome c with the spectroscopic EPR data In the refined Ssc structure, no evidence of a non-haem iron-sulfur centre was observed, probably because this centre is labile under aerobic conditions (see previous sections). In fact, the crystals that were used to determine the structure were obtained from preparations for which no special precautions for anaerobicity were taken, either in the purification or the crystallization steps. Further crystallization trials have, so far, systematically failed to produce good diffracting crystals. If this non-haem iron-sulfur centre was present in

the aerobic structure, even sub-stoichiometrically, the Fe atoms should have been clearly observed in a Fourier map using the anomalous differences as coefficients. The most remarkable implication of the threedimensional structure of this cytochrome resulted from the corrections to the primary structure reported above. While the Tyr86Cys error had been realized early in the refinement, that was not the case for the Ala171Cys error. Figure 6a shows the |Fo|)|Fc| electron density used to validate the presence of the four Cys residues at positions 44, 86, 147 and 171. In the three-dimensional structure of Ssc, Cys86 and Cys171 occur near two other Cys residues (Cys44 and Cys147). The obvious consequence of this fact is that these four Cys residues could constitute a binding site for a tetra-coordinated non-haem iron-sulfur centre. The presence of a non-haem iron centre was previously proposed [8]; however, the cysteine residues considered by those authors as being involved in the binding of the centre (Cys29, Cys44, Cys147 and Cys155) are not, with the exception of Cys44 and Cys147, located near one another in the 3D structure of Ssc, which invalidated that hypothesis. Besides being located in close proximity in the 3D structure of Ssc, as shown in Figs. 5b and 6a, the

four Cys residues (Cys44, Cys86, Cys147 and Cys171) which are now proposed to form the binding site of a non-haem iron-sulfur centre are located at an open surface pocket in the protein which is accessible from the outside, as illustrated in Fig. 6b. The pocket volume calculated with CASTp [40] of the basis on its molecular ° surface is 680 A3. Thus, solely on the basis of the pocket size, the non-haem iron-sulfur centre could be of the [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] type, which occupy volumes of 264 ° and 416 A3, respectively, as calculated by ASC [41] also on the basis of their molecular surfaces. The Sc atoms of the four cysteine residues for each of the four independent molecules in the asymmetric unit are located at the vertices of a distorted tetrahedron with ° S-S distances ranging between 3.7 and 7.4 A. This arrangement might suggest a [4Fe-4S] centre. However, the available spectroscopic data (EPR (see above) and Mossbauer [8]) favour a [2Fe-2S] centre instead. The ¨ coordinating Sc atoms of these clusters are usually co-planar and located at the corners of a rectangle. Therefore, the tetrahedral arrangement of the coordinating Sc atoms in Ssc, unless it turns out to be an artefact of the structure relaxation following the aerobic degradation of the iron-sulfur centre, will originate an

368

unusual coordination of the putative [2Fe-2S]. Also, since the molecule is a homodimer, there are two such possible [2Fe-2S] binding sites in the molecule. A simple modelling of an idealized [2Fe-2S] centre into this four-Cys binding site showed that under some circumstances it could be fit into the binding pocket with only a minor structural rearrangement of the pro-

Fig. 7a, b Schemes showing two possible binding modes of the [2Fe-2S] centre in the putative binding pocket of Dd27k Ssc. a Idealized [2Fe-2S] centre with four Fe binding positions fit to Cys44 Sc, Cys86 Sc, Cys147 Sc and Cys171 Sc. b Idealized [2Fe-2S] centre with three Fe binding positions fit to Cys86 Sc, Cys147 Sc and Cys171 Sc. The numbers below the residues indicate the calculated distances between the Cys Sc atoms in the idealized centre as modelled and the actual Cys Sc positions in the 3D structure of the aerobic form of Dd27k Ssc. Similar values are observed for all the four independent monomers in the asymmetric unit

tein. Two binding schemes were considered and are represented in Fig. 7: (a) a fully tetra-coordinated [2Fe-2S] centre and (b) a tri-coordinated [2Fe-2S] centre, where Cys44 is not ligated and one of the Fe coordinating positions would remain vacant. As shown in Fig. 7, because of the tetrahedral arrangement of the Sc atoms in the observed crystal structure of Ssc, the typical [2Fe2S] coordination mode in scheme (a) introduces a far greater strain in the molecular structure of Ssc, requiring a significantly larger readjustment of the structure in order to accommodate the [2Fe-2S] centre with an acceptable coordination geometry. On the other hand, ° scheme (b) only requires small ( <0.6 A) changes in the c positions of the Cys S atoms which could be mainly accommodated by changes in their C-Ca-Cb-Sc dihedral angles. The presence of a [2Fe-2S] centre with only three cysteine ligands, although unusual, is not unprecedented, as in NifU from Azotobacter vinelandii one of the iron-sulfur centres is bound by only three cysteines, resulting in a labile centre. The lability of this cluster is functionally important for the role proposed for NifU in the assembly of the FeS centres [42]. Interestingly, the vacant Fe coordinating position in the hypothetical tri-coordinate binding mode of the [2Fe-2S] centre would be accessible to any possible substrate species that might interact with the exposed [2Fe-2S] centre, as illustrated in Fig. 6b. Finally, as illustrated in Figs. 5a and 6a, one of the cysteine residues in the putative binding site (Cys147) is followed in the sequence by one histidine residue (His148) which is one of the axial ligands of the innermost haem group from the other monomer. This could constitute a simple electron transfer path between the [2Fe-2S] centres (one from each monomer) and the haem core. The unusual type of coordination of a [2Fe-2S] centre to the Dd27k split-Soret cytochrome still needs to be confirmed by the X-ray structure of the intact protein.

Since the present work revealed that the stability of this cluster depends on the degree of oxygen exposure, future work will proceed with samples prepared under anaerobic conditions, in order to confirm the structure of this novel iron-sulfur centre. Comparison between the structure of Dd27k Ssc and the model for A. fulgidus AF0016 As expected, considering the significant amino acid similarity between Dd27k Ssc and the putative homologues from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G20, Desulfitobacterium hafniense DCB-2 and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, prediction of their 3D structures (data not shown) indicate that all the proteins may have similar structures. In the structure of the Ssc monomer, two domains can be considered: an N-terminal a domain, containing nine helices and including the putative ligands for the iron-sulfur cluster, and a C-terminal haem-binding domain. To our knowledge, none of these domains have structural similarity with any other known 3D structure (results from a search made using the DALI server at EBI-EMBL, on the PDB database, http://www.ebi. ac.uk/dali). As mentioned above, the sequence database search also detected a putative protein, A. fulgidus AF0016, with significant primary structure similarity with Dd27k Ssc (23% identity and 38% similarity) (Fig. 1), that does not contain the haem binding motifs. The comparison between the primary structure of just the a domain of Dd27k Ssc (from amino acid residues 11 to 199) with part of AF0016 sequence (from amino acid residues 1 to 188) leads to an increase in the identity and similarity values to 27% and 44%, respectively. Thus, it was interesting to extend this comparison at the level of the secondary and tertiary structures of the two proteins. In fact, the secondary structure of the Dd27k Ssc and that predicted for the AF0016 protein were found to be very similar (Fig. 1), and a model for the 3D structure of AF0016 could be obtained (Fig. 8) using the N-terminal a domain of the Ssc 3D structure as a template. These results suggest that the 3D structure of the non-haem binding domain of the split-Soret cytochrome shares relevant common features with the structure of the AF0016 putative protein. Hence, the A. fulgidus protein could also accommodate an iron-sulfur centre, but it only contains three cysteine residues, lacking that equivalent to Dd27k Ssc Cys171, which is substituted by a glutamate (Glu155).

Conclusions
The cloning and sequencing of the Dd27k Ssc confirmed its periplasmic localization and revealed its signal peptide sequence. The correct amino acid sequence had implications in the structure of the protein since it was realized that the two new cysteine residues (86 and 171) are located in a surface pocket

in the protein, along with, and in close proximity to, two other cysteine residues (44 and 147). Altogether they may form the binding site for a [2Fe-2S] centre that, however, was not detected in the crystal structure obtained from an aerobically prepared sample. The instability of this centre was shown to be related to the degree of oxygen exposure during the purification procedures, since the anaerobically prepared sample of the split-Soret cytochrome contains a considerable higher amount of non-haem iron. A simple modelling of an idealized [2Fe-2S] centre into the putative binding pocket, located near the mouth of a surface pocket in each monomer, suggests a possibly unusual coordination, where only three of the four available Cys residues (86, 147 and 171) bind the two iron atoms, leaving one free coordination position which is accessible from the outside of the molecule. An easy electron transfer route between the [2Fe-2S] centre and the haem core can be achieved via His148, which coordinates the iron atom in one of the haem groups in the other monomer. The overall structure of the haem core and of the iron-sulfur centres therefore suggests that this cytochrome has a not yet found enzymatic activity. The fact that the levels of ssc mRNA in nitrate-grown cells of Dd27k are considerably higher than in sulfate-grown cells may indicate an involvement in the nitrate respiratory chain of D. desulfuricans. This hypothesis is consistent with the finding of genes encoding for very similar putative proteins in the genomes of other bacteria capable of respiring nitrate or nitrite: D. desulfuricans G20, Shewanella oneidensis and Desulfitobacterium hafniense. Unlike the A. fulgidus putative protein, the putative gene products from the other three organisms contain the necessary residues for the binding of two c-type haems, in addition to the iron-sulfur binding domain. The reduction of nitrite by ammonia-forming organisms appears to be straightforward as it involves a single six-electron transferring step, performed by a similar multi-haem-containing enzyme in different bacterial species such as E. coli [43, 44] or D. desulfuricans [11, 45]. However, since the split-Soret cytochrome can be found in several other nitrate/nitrite respiring organisms and its synthesis in D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774 is clearly induced by these conditions, the reduction of nitrite to ammonia, an important reaction in the nitrogen cycle, is most probably more complicated than it appears from our present knowledge. The presence of a putative homologous protein in the sulfate-reducing archaeon A. fulgidus, whose genome also encodes a putative protein involved in the respiration of nitrogen oxides [15], further supports this conclusion. Interestingly, in the genome of the sulfate reducer D. vulgaris, neither a cytochrome equivalent to the split-Soret cytochrome nor proteins sharing similarities with the iron-sulfur domain of the Ssc or with the A. fulgidus protein could be detected.
