Molecular Biophysics Unit Indian Institute of Science Bangalore ± 560 012, India The structure of basic Winged Bean Agglutinin (WBAI) with two dimeric molecules complexed with methyl-a-D-galactopyranoside in the asymmetric unit, has been determined by the molecular replacement method Ê and re®ned with 2.5 A X-ray intensity data. The polypeptide chain of each monomer has the characteristic legume lectin tertiary fold. The structure clearly de®nes the lectin-carbohydrate interactions. It reveals how the unusually long variable loop in the binding region endows the lectin with its characteristic sugar speci®city. The lectin forms non-canonical dimers of the type found in Erythrina corallodendron lectin (EcorL) even though glycosylation, unlike in EcorL, does not prevent the formation of canonical dimers. The structure thus further demonstrates that the mode of dimerisation of legume lectins is not necessarily determined by the covalently bound carbohydrate but is governed by features intrinsic to the protein. The present analysis and our earlier work on peanut lectin (PNA), show that legume lectins are a family of proteins in which small alterations in essentially the same tertiary structure lead to wide variations in quaternary association. A relationship among the non-canonical modes of dimeric association in legume lectins is presented.

Introduction
Lectins, a class of multivalent proteins, speci®cally recognise and bind carbohydrates on cell surfaces. This ability has led to their diverse biological properties and widespread applications in biochemistry, cell biology and medicine (Sharon & Lis, 1989; Rini, 1995). Lectins have been isolated from a variety of sources even though the early studies were mainly on plant lectins. Of the various plant lectins, those from leguminous sources are the best studied. Legume lectins exhibit remarkable similarities among themselves in tertiary structure, geometry of the metal binding region and the location of the carbohydrate binding region, but show signi®cant

diversity in sugar speci®city and oligomerisation (Hardman & Ainsworth, 1972; Becker et al., 1975; Einspahr et al., 1986; Reeke & Becker, 1986; Bourne et al., 1990a; Delbaere et al., 1993; Shaanan et al., 1991; Loris et al., 1993; Banerjee et al., 1994, 1996; Dessen et al., 1995; Hamelryck et al., 1996). The characteristic legume lectin fold appears in other proteins with unrelated source and sequence as well and it has come to be recognised as an important carbohydrate binding motif (Liao et al., 1994; Crennell et al., 1994; Lobsanov et al., 1993; Emsley et al., 1994). Legume lectins are broadly classi®ed as galactose binding lectins such as EcorL, PNA, lectin IV from Griffonia simplicifolia (GS4) and soybean agglutinin (SBA), and glucose/ mannose binding lectins like concanavalin A (con A), Pea lectin, Lathyrus ochrus isolectin I (LOLI) and lentil lectin. However, subtle and important differences in carbohydrate speci®cities exist within each class. Crystal structures of a number of legume lectin-sugar complexes have been determined (Banerjee et al., 1996; Derewenda et al., 1989;

They show that part of the protein-carbohydrate interactions, primarily involving three loops in the carbohydrate binding region, remain largely invariant. The remaining interactions involving the fourth loop, vary substantially and are presumably responsible for the differences in the speci®cities of legume lectins. This loop is the longest in WBAI, a 58 kDa homodimeric glycosylated legume lectin (Kortt, 1984). The lectin is highly speci®c to blood group A1 substances and moderately so to A2 and B substances, but does not recognise O substances (Kortt, 1984; Khan et al., 1986; Matsuda et al., 1989). The elucidation of the role of the long fourth loop in generating this speci®city is one of the aims of the structure analysis of the WBAI-methyl-a-D-galactose complex, reported here. The structure of WBAI is also expected to provide insights into the causes for the variability in subunit association in legume lectins which are dimers or dimers of dimers. Most of them form canonical dimers of the type found in con A, in which the association involves the formation of a contiguous 12-stranded b-sheet, six strands belonging to each of the two subunits (Hardman & Ainsworth, 1972; Becker et al., 1975). Other types of dimers are found in GS4 (Delbaere et al., 1990, 1993), EcorL (Shaanan et al., 1991) and PNA (Banerjee et al., 1994, 1996). WBAI has 63% sequence identity with EcorL which is prevented from forming a canonical dimer by glycosylation at a site in the subunit interface. The glycosylation sites in WBAI are far away from this interface and

therefore covalently bound sugar does not interfere with the formation of canonical dimers. However, if the mode of dimerisation is primarily dictated by factors intrinsic to the protein itself, then WBAI is likely to form an EcorL-type dimer. The structure analysis of the lectin would naturally resolve this problem, which is of considerable general interest.

Results and Discussion
Monomer structure WBAI is a single polypeptide chain of 241 residues. The secondary and tertiary structures of the subunit are similar to those of other legume lectins with major deviations restricted to the loops. The r.m.s. deviation of the Ca atoms of WBAI from those of EcorL, to which it has the highest Ê sequence homology, is 0.86 A. As in the other lectins, WBAI contains three b-sheets: the six-stranded back b-sheet made up of residues 1 to 7, 67 to 73, 161 to 167, 172 to 178, 186 to 192 and 228 to 235; the seven-stranded curved b-sheet consisting of residues 17 to 22, 45 to 52, 88 to 94, 118 to 125, 135 to 142, 148 to 152 and 203 to 210; and a smaller third b-sheet involving residues 24 to 26, 30 to 33, 74 to 77, 159 to 160 and 223 to 226, which has a role in connecting the ®rst two sheets. The rest of the residues, accounting for nearly half the chain, belong to loops. Figure 1 shows the polypeptide chain conformation of the monomer, the bound sugar, metals and the N-linked carbohydrates.

789 in EcorL. Another feature observed in galactose binding lectins is a hydrogen bond involving the variable loop with O4. The concerned protein atoms are Asp212 N in WBAI, Ala218 N in Ecorl and Ser211 OG in PNA. A water molecule located in the combining site, also contributes to the binding of the carbohydrate to the lectin (Figure 2(a)). It bridges the O2 atom of the sugar to Asn128 ND2 and Gly105 N through hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, as in other lectins, an aromatic side-chain, that of Phe126 in WBAI, stacks against the sugar ring. It is known that the lectin binds only galactose moieties with a-linkages (Matsuda et al., 1989) unlike PNA and EcorL which have signi®cant af®nities for those with a- as well as b-linkages (Swamy et al., 1991; Surolia et al., 1996). The crystal structures of the other two lectins clearly show that neither a- nor b-linkage leads to unacceptable steric interactions. On the other hand, as illustrated in Figure 2(b) and (c), a b-linkage, as in lactose and methyl-b-D-galactose, leads to unacceptable steric contact with the long fourth loop, particularly Ser214 and Gly215, while an a- linkage is sterically acceptable. Yet another feature of the sugar binding by WBAI is the increased af®nities for galactose with substitutions at C2-position such as N-acetylgalactosamine. The crystal structure provides a ready explanation for this enhancement in af®nity. Simple modelling shows that the N-acetyl group substituted at C2-position nestles in a pocket made up of Tyr106 and Trp130. Furthermore, O7 of the acetyl group could make a hydrogen bond, Ê with distance varying between 3.5 and 3.7 A, with Ser214 OG belonging to the long fourth loop. These observations provide a general explanation for the speci®cities of the lectin for blood group substances. The linkage at the terminal sugar is a in A (N-acetylgalactosamine) and B (galactose) substances whereas it is b in the O substance. Therefore the lectin recognises A and B, but not O. In addition, the galactose ring has an acetyl group attached to the C2-position in A, but not in B. Hence the higher af®nity of the lectin for the A substance. Dimerisation The mode of association in the two dimers in the asymmetric unit is very nearly the same and is similar to that in EcorL. The two subunits in the EcorL dimer are related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis whereas two independent non-crystallographic 2-fold axes are present in the WBAI dimers. In both the dimers, the intersubunit interactions primarily involve the fourth (161 to 167), the ®fth (172 to 178) and the sixth (186 to 192) strands in the ¯at b-sheet (Figure 3). The intersubunit hydrogen bonds present in both the dimers are Arg71 NH1 . . . O Ile185, Arg71 NH2 . . . O Ile 185, Lys148 NZ . . . OG Ser169, Lys165 NZ . . . O Thr187 and His174 ND1 . . . OG1 Thr187. Three of these are found in EcorL while two are not. The interactions

Metal binding Each WBAI subunit contains a calcium ion and a manganese ion (Figure 1). The metal binding region is totally conserved in legume lectins. In WBAI, Glu122 OE2, Asp124 OD2, Asp131 OD1 and His136 NE2 and two water molecules coordinate to the Mn2 while Asp124 OD1 and OD2, Phe126 O, Asn128 OD1, Asp131 OD2 and two other water molecules coordinate to the Ca2. The metal ions do not interact directly with sugar, but facilitate the orientation of the carbohydrate binding site residues for optimum interaction. N-linked carbohydrate From the primary structure of the lectin (Puri & Surolia, 1994; Sharma et al., 1996), two regions with the sequence Asn-X-Thr/Ser could be identi®ed as potential sites for N-linked carbohydrate. Plant speci®c heptasaccharide (Mana6(Mana3) (Xylb2)Manb4GlcNAcb4(L-Fuca3)GlcNAcb) is covalently bound to the side-chains of Asn44 and Asn219. Electron density exists only for the ®rst three sugar rings of the heptasaccharide. These sugars have only partial occupancy. Superposition of the entire heptasaccharide, as found in EcorL at the WBAI glycosylation sites does not lead to any steric hindrance either with the same protein molecule or with the neighbouring molecules. The two sites occur on adjacent loops, 34 to 44 and 211 to 222, located on the top of the molecule between the second and the third b-sheets. The two glycosylation sites are close to each other with a distance Ê of 16.1 A between Asn44 ND2 and Asn219 ND2 Ê (the distance is 10.4 A if the Ca atoms are considered). The two loops are bridged by a water molecule which might additionally stabilise the region. Carbohydrate binding and specificity Clear electron density is seen for the bound methyl-a-D-galactose molecule in the carbohydrate binding site made up of four loops and located at the top front of the molecule. As in other legume lectins, three of them (78 to 87, 95 to 117 and 124 to 134) are substantially conserved and provide the necessary structural framework for sugar binding while the fourth loop (211 to 222), with variable sequence and length, determines the speci®city (Young & Oomen, 1992; Sharma & Surolia, 1997). The variable loop in WBAI is the longest found so far in legume lectins. Residues from all the four loops interact with methyl-a-D-galactose through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions (Figure 2(a) and Table 1). The hydrogen bonds between the ®rst three loops and the bound carbohydrate, except that involving O6, are similar to those found in the complexes of EcorL (Figure 2(b)) and PNA. In WBAI, His84 NE2 makes a hydrogen bond with O6, instead of Asp80 OD2 of the same loop in PNA, and Gln219 NE2 of the variable loop

791 in EcorL. The glycosylation sites in WBAI (Figure 4) are far away from this interface and cannot possibly affect the formation of canonical dimers. However, if the mode of dimerisation is determined by the features of the protein itself, WBAI is likely to form an EcorL-type dimer in view of the high sequence homology between the two lectins. The crystal structure demonstrates that this is indeed the case. The WBAI structure, and the earlier work on PNA (Banerjee et al., 1994, 1996), conclusively demonstrate that legume lectins are an interesting family of proteins in which small alterations in essentially the same tertiary fold lead to large changes in quaternary structure. The alterations in the tertiary fold would of course depend upon differences in sequence and therefore the above observation is of considerable relevance in relation to the problem of protein folding. Indeed, legume lectins form an ideal system for studying the effect of sequence variations on quaternary association. Relationship among non-canonical modes of dimerisation in legume lectins Careful examination of the dimers of EcorL, PNA, GS4 and WBAI revealed an interesting relationship among the modes of association in them. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 5. In all the four structures, the ¯at b-sheets from the two monomers associate back-to-back. The angle between the two sheets in EcorL, WBAI, GS4 and PNA is 47.6, 49.3, 78.1 and 96.1 , respectively. If one of the two subunits in the four lectins are superposed and held stationary, the association in WBAI, GS4 and PNA can be obtained from an EcorL dimer, by simply rotating the other subunit by 0.9, 19.5 and 26.2 , respectively, about an axis nearly perpendicular to the approximate plane containing the four dyads and passing through their common point of intersection. Therefore, the mode of dimerisation in the four lectins is essentially the same; the difference is only in the orientation between the two sheets.

Val176, Val176 . . . Ile178 and Val178 . . . Ile185. The hydrophobic interactions are conserved in EcorL either by the same residues or by similar residues while in the case of GS4 and PNA major changes are observed. Furthermore, WBAI and EcorL deviate from the interaction pattern common to GS4 and PNA. Of the average surÊ face area of 1715 A2 buried on dimerisation, 68% is hydrophobic (Lee & Richards, 1971). In both the dimers, nine water molecules are involved in bridging the monomers (Figure 3). Of these, one is located on the non-crystallographic 2-fold axis, as in the case of EcorL. The major interest in the mode of dimerisation of WBAI is in relation to determining the relative importance of glycosylation and features intrinsic to the protein, in the variability exhibited by legume lectins in quaternary association. As illustrated in Figure 4, the glycosylation site in EcorL is at the interface between the two monomers in the canonical dimer, which is believed to be the favoured mode of association in legume lectins. Therefore, this mode of dimerisation cannot occur

Conclusions
Recognition on the cell surface, often mediated by carbohydrates, is of crucial importance in biology. Many processes such as cell-cell interactions, immune functions and defence against pathogens in general, infection, symbiosis, differentiation and development, involve such recognition. Lectins are exquisitely speci®c to different cell surface carbohydrates and are of considerable use in exploring cell surface recognition. The main features responsible for carbohydrate binding by

legume lectins, the most thoroughly studied family of lectins, are now well understood (Sharon, 1993; Drickamer, 1995). Less well understood is the structural basis for differences in the carbohydrate speci®city of different legume lectins. In this context, the structure of WBAI, reported here, is of considerable interest in that it provides a convincing explanation, on the basis of the long variable loop, for the speci®city of the lectin for carbohydrates as well as, by extrapolation, for blood group substances. The variability in the quaternary association of legume lectins, which could in¯uence the process of recognition in general and agglutination in particular, is only beginning to receive the attention it deserves. The structure of WBAI in comparison with that of EcorL further demonstrates that this variability is intrinsic to the protein, and not dependent on glycosylation, and it follows the variation in amino acid sequence.

Materials and Methods
Crystallisation One of the crystal forms reported earlier (Sankaranarayanan et al., 1993) was used in the present study. Crystals of this form were grown by the sitting drop method in which 25 ml of an 80 mg/ml protein solution in 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), containing 0.15 M NaCl, 0.025 (w/v) NaN3, 20 times molar excess of methyl-a-D-galactose and 6 to 7.5% (w/v) PEG8000, was equilibrated at 20 C with a reservoir solution of 40% PEG8000 in the same buffer (Sankaranarayanan et al., 1993). The crystals belong to the space group P21212 Ê with cell dimensions a  157.59, b  91.91, c  73.28 A.

further positional re®nement it dropped to 23%. The data used for re®nement were then extended gradually Ê to 2.5 A and many cycles of model building and positional re®nement using POWELL minimisation (Powell, 1977) in the X-PLOR package were carried out. The sugar ligand methyl-a-D-galactopyranoside was located in the F0 À Fc as well as the 2Fo À Fc maps without any ambiguity in all the four subunits. After further positional re®nement, a 1/8th omit map (Vijayan, 1980; Bhat & Cohen, 1984) was computed to remove possible ambiguities due to model bias. The map gave a clear indication of the atomic positions in loops 110 to 117 and 210 to 220, which were not included in the original model. The latter forms the variable loop in the sugar binding site. Successive 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps computed between re®nement cycles yielded the positions of water oxygen atoms and the R-factor dropped to 19.6%. At this stage one more omit map was computed to check the correctness of the model. The N-linked sugars were located from a subsequent Fo À Fc map. All non-zero re¯ections were used in the ®nal cycle of re®nement. Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were used in several cycles. The restraints were progressively relaxed but not altogether removed. Group displacement parameters, one common to all main-chain atoms and another to all side-chain atoms in each residue, were employed to improve parameters to observations ratio. However, individual atomic displacement parameters were re®ned in the case of sugar atoms and water oxygen atoms. The ®nal re®nement statistics are given in Table 3. The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; Bernstein et al., 1977; code: 1WBL for coordinates and r1WBLsf for structure factors). The release date for coordinates is 8th April, 1998. Accuracy, conformation angles, displacement parameters and hydrogen bonds The geometry and the stereochemistry of the model were checked using the PROCHECK package (Laskowski et al., 1993). The Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) calculated at the end of the re®nement indicated a coorÊ dinate error of 0.17 A in atomic positions. None of the residues have Ramachandran angles (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968) in the disallowed region. The r.m.s. deviations of a-carbon positions in subunits 1, 2, 3 and 4 Table 3.

Data collection Data were collected using a Siemens Area Detector system mounted on a GX 20 rotating anode generator and were processed using XENGEN (Howard et al., 1987). Table 2 gives the details of data collection. Structure solution As the crystal structures of a number of legume lectins were already available when the study was initiated, the obvious choice for the structure solution of WBAI, was the molecular replacement method (Rossmann & Blow, 1962). As the mode of dimeric association of WBAI was not known, a monomer was used as the search model. EcorL has the highest sequence homology (63% identity) among legume lectins with WBAI, and a monomer of this lectin was used in the calculation. In the search model, non-identical residues were changed to alanine and two loops were deleted. Expectedly, the rotation function maps (Crowther, 1972) calculated using MERLOT (Fitzgerald, 1988) with this model were noisy as, with two dimers in the asymmetric unit, the model constituted less than 25% of the scattering matter. However, it was possible to extract the correct solutions after careful examination of the mutual relationship of the peaks, which indicated the presence of two EcorL-type of dimers in the asymmetric unit. The use of the EcorL dimer as the search model at this stage resulted in clean and unique solutions. Computation of self rotation function maps at various kappa values yielded a strong noncrystallographic 2-fold relating the dimers in addition to the individual 2-folds. Positions of the two dimers were determined using the Crowther and Blow translation function (Crowther & Blow, 1967) routine in MERLOT. Refinement Fifteen cycles of rigid body minimization with data Ê È extending to 3.0 A, using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) resulted in the R-factor dropping from 50% to 40%. The model was rebuilt using FRODO (Jones, 1978) on the basis of the electron density maps calculated at this stage. The simulated annealing protocol in the X-PLOR program was used to further re®ne the model which was 87% complete. The R-factor dropped to 26% and on

Ê from the averaged model are 0.14, 0.15, 0.14 and 0.17 A, respectively. The corresponding values for the atoms in Ê the bound sugar are 0.15, 0.17, 0.18 and 0.19 A. The sidechain torsion angles by and large follow the expected distribution (Bhat et al., 1979; McGregor et al., 1987). The maximum, the minimum and the average B-values for Ê main-chain atoms are 84.5, 2.0 and 16.5 A2, respectively. The corresponding values for the side-chain atoms, atoms in methyl-a-D-galactopyranoside, water oxygen atomss and atoms in the N-linked sugars are 95.5, 2.0 and 21.8; 40.6, 8.0 and 23.5; 81.0, 2.0 and 40.1 and 90.3, Ê 32.6 and 55.8 A2, respectively. The average occupancy of the glycosylated sugar is 0.82. Hydrogen bonds were computed using the program CONTACT in the CCP4 suite of programs (SERC Daresbury Laboratory, 1994). Donor to acceptor distances less Ê than 3.6 A were treated as hydrogen bonds if the angle at H was greater than 120 in N-H . . . O contacts and the C-O . . . O angle was greater than 90 in the O . . . O contacts (Kodandapani et al., 1990; Madhusudan & Vijayan, 1991; Radha Kishan et al., 1995). Where water oxygen Ê atoms are involved, only a distance cut-off of 3.6 A was used.
