A series of mutants of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2), at residues that interact with the inhibited enzyme subtilisin BPN, were studied to determine the relative importance of intermolecular contacts on either side of the scissile bond. Mutants were tested for inhibition of subtilisin, rates of hydrolysis by subtilisin, and ability to acylate subtilisin. Additionally, crystal structures of the mutant CI2 complexes with subtilisin were obtained. Ordered water molecules were found to play an important role in inhibitor recognition, and features of the crystal structures, in combination with biochemical data, support a transitionstate stabilization role for the P1 residue in subtilisin catalysis. Consistent with the proposed mechanism of inhibition, in which rapid acylation is followed by religation, leaving-group contacts with the enzyme were found to be more critical determinants of inhibition than acylating-group contacts in the mutants studied here.

ABSTRACT:

The protein inhibitors of serine proteases inhibit enzymes by binding extremely tightly at the enzyme active site yet resisting proteolysis (1, 2). Using the subtilisin/chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2)1 complex as a model, we have previously presented evidence (3) that these inhibitors form acylenzyme intermediates rapidly with target enzymes, but the inhibitor rapidly religates, in preference to the forward reaction of hydrolytic deacylation. In Scheme 1, k-2 is much greater than k3, resulting in an apparent equilibrium between the Michaelis complex and the acyl-enzyme. We have termed this rapid religation phenomenon, in which the tight and oriented binding of the leaving-group peptide (H2N-R in Scheme 1) prevents acyl-enzyme hydrolysis and favors the reverse reaction, the clogged gutter mechanism (3). On the basis of this mechanism, in which inhibition is caused by the very slow rate-limiting step of deacylation and product release, we would predict that those interactions

between the enzyme and inhibitor involving the leavinggroup R fragment of CI2 would be particularly critical. With good substrates of subtilisin, acylation is typically ratelimiting (4, 5), and substrate specificity and reaction rates are largely determined by contacts between the enzyme and the acylating R portion of the substrate, most notably the P1 residue2 (6, 7). In contrast, for inhibitors that act by the clogged gutter mechanism, interactions between the enzyme and P1 residue are predicted to be comparatively less important for inhibitor hydrolysis than those interactions with R residues that promote leaving-group retention in the active site. To expand our understanding of this mechanism of inhibition, we examined the details of intermolecular interactions between CI2 and subtilisin BPN. We began by examining the time frame of acylation, showing that, for the initial reaction (k2 in Scheme 1), CI2 is comparable to a good substrate and hence that the deacylation reaction is solely

Mutations at the Subtilisin/CI2 Interface responsible for the proteolytic resistance of the inhibitor. Next, we systematically mutated residues of CI2 at the binding interface that make substantial contacts with the enzyme. On the acylating R side of the scissile bond, we chose the P1 Met 59 residue of CI2, which immediately precedes the cleavage point and binds in the S1 primary specificity subsite of subtilisin, as the main target of study. The CI2 P1 residue was mutated to Phe and Tyr, which are the most preferred P1 residues for subtilisin (7-9), Lys, which is proposed to form stabilizing electrostatic interactions with the enzyme (10, 11), and Ala and Gly, which remove large hydrophobic side-chain contacts and potentially allow greater backbone mobility. On the leaving group R side of the scissile bond, the P2 residue Tyr 61 shows the closest association with the enzyme, forming an aromatic ring stacking interaction with Phe 189 of subtilisin (12); accordingly, Tyr 61 of CI2 was mutated to Ala, altering these favorable contacts. The native and mutant complexes were compared with respect to binding affinities, rates of cleavage, and ability to form the acyl-enzyme. Additionally, crystal structures of the complexes were analyzed to determine whether the observed functional effects arise solely from the loss of the targeted intermolecular interactions and whether the scissile bond is still optimally oriented for acylation in the mutant complexes. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Subtilisin BPN. Recombinant subtilisin BPN (13), modified by the addition of a C-terminal 6-His tag (3), was prepared as described previously (14). Active enzyme concentrations were determined by kinetic assay with succinyl-AlaAla-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide as described previously (14). CI2. Truncated recombinant CI2 (3, 14) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (14). Throughout the text, we use the amino acid numbering of the original full-length protein sequence. The CI2 expression construct was mutagenized using the PCR-based QuikChange method (Stratagene), and the mutant expression constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Mutant CI2 proteins were expressed and purified following the same protocols used for the wild-type inhibitor (14). Wild-type and mutant CI2 concentrations were determined by peak integration from HPLC absorbance traces and by titration with subtilisin BPN of a known concentration, as described previously (14). Subtilisin Inhibition (Binding) Studies. CI2 is a potent slow, tight-binding inhibitor of subtilisin (15). Inhibition constants Ki were calculated from the reduced rates of subtilisin hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate, succinyl-Ala-Ala-ProPhe-p-nitroanilide, in the presence of wild-type or mutant CI2 [all assay conditions, procedures, equations, and analysis are described in detail elsewhere (14)]. Ki values reported represent mean values from two or more experiments. Hydrolysis Studies. The initial linear rate of depletion of intact CI2 in time-course incubations with subtilisin BPN was monitored by HPLC, as described previously (14). For each time point, HPLC injections were performed in duplicate, and remaining CI2 quantities were determined by peak integration of absorbance traces and comparison to standard curves generated from known quantities of pure CI2 (14). SDS-PAGE of Acyl-Enzyme Complexes. Subtilisin BPN (1-8 µg) was incubated with a molar excess of each CI2

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 43, 2004 13649 variant (3-10 µg) in 100 mM Tris at pH 8.6, on ice for 15 min, to allow formation of an apparent equilibrium mixture of the noncovalent complex and the acyl-enzyme species. Samples were acidified to pH 1 to inactivate subtilisin prior to denaturation by heating in a loading buffer. SDS gels (15% acrylamide) were run under standard conditions using a BioRad Minigel apparatus and Coomassie-stained using standard procedures. A homemade molecular weight marker, in which the protein standards were present in varying amounts ranging from 0.05 to 1 µg, was used to quantify the acylenzyme band by comparison, using a Kodak Digital Science DC40 camera and Kodak Digital Science 1D electrophoresis documentation and analysis software. Rapid Quench ObserVation of Acyl-Enzyme Formation. Reactions were run in a Bio-Logic SFM-400/Q four-syringe quench-flow instrument, configured with no additional delay lines between the mixers and equipped with a circulating water bath to control the temperature of the reactants. Syringe 1 contained subtilisin BPN (14 µM in 10 mM NH4OAc at pH 5.8 and 1 mM DTT); syringe 2 contained buffer (50 mM NH4HCO3 at pH 8.6); syringe 3 contained CI2 (28 µM in 25 mM NH4HCO3 at pH 8.6); and syringe 4 contained quench solution (0.8% TFA). Reactions took place at 25 °C in the 22 µL intermixer volume between mixers 2 and 3, with the reaction times determined by the flow rate, and the enzyme was effectively quenched by acidification to pH 1 after mixing with the TFA quench solution at mixer 3. Reactions after mixing contained 3.5 µM subtilisin and 14 µM CI2 prior to quenching, and reaction times ranged from 2.75 to 82.5 ms. Quenched reaction volumes were collected, immediately frozen on dry ice, lyophilized, and then redissolved in gel-loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Crystallization. Crystals of the mutant complexes failed to form under the conditions used previously to grow crystals of the native complex in space group P212121 (3). A broad screen of crystallization conditions identified a robust protocol that yielded good diffraction quality crystals for all CI2 variant complexes, with only minor customization of conditions for each variant. Crystals of the native complex were grown as well under these new conditions. Lyophilized subtilisin BPN and CI2 were each dissolved in 10 mM NaOAc (pH 5.8) and mixed in a 1:1.2 stoichiometric molar ratio; the ideal total protein concentration varied among the CI2 mutants. Crystals were grown at 4 °C in hanging drops over a reservoir of 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 4.6), 20% 2-propanol, and 15% PEG; the optimal molecular weight of PEG varied among the CI2 mutants. Crystal drops were prepared by mixing 2 µL of the protein solution with 2 µL from the reservoir or, in some cases, 5 µL of the protein solution with 5 µL from the reservoir; some CI2 variants required an additional additive to the drop to achieve the best possible crystal diffraction quality. Customizations of the protocol for individual CI2 variants are as follows: the wild-type and M59K CI2 complexes were grown in PEG 4000, with 4 mg/mL total protein concentration and 3% xylitol added to the crystallization drops; the M59F and Y61A CI2 complexes were grown in PEG 400, with 5 mg/mL total protein concentration; the M59G CI2 complex was grown in PEG 400, with 3 mg/mL total protein concentration; the M59A CI2 complex was grown in PEG monomethyl ether 750, with 5 mg/mL total protein concentration;

and the M59Y CI2 complex was grown in PEG 750 monomethyl ether, with 4 mg/mL total protein concentration. Crystals were rod-shaped with hexagonal cross sections and belonged to space group P6522. Crystals were briefly transferred to a cryoprotectant solution, containing 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 4.6), 15% 2-propanol, 15% PEG 2000, and 20% PEG 400, and then were flash-frozen in liquid N2. For crystals subjected to a pH jump, the cryoprotectant solution contained 0.1 M CHES (pH 9.0), 15% 2-propanol, 15% PEG 2000, and 20% PEG 400. Crystal Data Collection and Processing. For each variant CI2 complex, synchrotron X-ray data were collected from a single crystal at 100 K using an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector at Advanced Light Source beamline 5.0.1 or 8.3.1, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The automation package ELVES (16) was used to direct MOLFLM (17), for indexing and integration, and SCALA (18), for scaling and merging the reflections. The M59K CI2 complex was the first to yield diffraction quality crystals under the described crystallization conditions, and the M59K CI2 complex structure was solved by molecular replacement using EPMR (19), using as the search model the wild-type CI2/subtilisin complex in space group P212121 (PDB ID 1LW6), with solvent molecules omitted (3). A test set comprised of 5% of the total reflections, assigned at random, was excluded from refinement to allow calculation of the free R factor. The model was improved through alternating cycles of manual rebuilding using the interactive graphics program O (20), automated refinement using REFMAC5 (21), and automated solvent addition using ARP/WARP (22). Structure refinement of the subsequent variant CI2 complexes used the near-finished structure of the M59K CI2 complex as a starting model and followed the same refinement protocol. The free R test sets for the subsequent variant CI2 complexes were inherited from the M59K CI2 complex. Model validation was carried out using PROCHECK (18) and WHATCHECK (23). Superpositions were performed using GEM (24). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION CI2 Mechanism of Inhibition. Although the protein protease inhibitors are often thought of as unreactive, we have previously shown that an acyl-enzyme species forms within the first minutes after mixing of CI2 and subtilisin BPN (3). We now show that the acyl-enzyme is detectable within milliseconds after mixing (Figure 1), and while our assay method is not quantitative enough to allow exact determination of an acylation rate constant (k2 in Scheme 1), it is

apparent from this illustration that CI2 falls into the category of excellent peptide substrates of subtilisin with respect to the acylation step. For comparison, the good peptide substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide displays rate-limiting acylation with subtilisin BPN and is cleaved with a kcat of 50 s-1, equivalent to a turnover time of 0.02 s (5). For CI2, the subsequent deacylation and product release steps are not so facile, however, because the overall rate for turnover is 3.8 × 10-6 s-1, equivalent to a turnover time of 3 days (14). The proportion of the enzyme present in the acylated form accumulates to represent only 6% of the total, indicating that the back reaction of peptide religation (k-2 in Scheme 1) is rapid and that the Michaelis complex is favored over the acyl-enzyme in the resulting equilibrium (3). To understand how the attractive intermolecular binding forces on either side of the scissile bond contribute to this mechanism of inhibition, we analyzed six CI2 mutants, M59F, M59Y, M59K, M59A, M59G, and Y61A, with respect to inhibition constants with subtilisin, rates of hydrolysis by subtilisin, formation of an acyl-enzyme with subtilisin, and structural changes in the complexes with subtilisin. Inhibition Constants, Hydrolysis Rates, and Acyl-Enzyme Formation of CI2 Mutant Complexes. The data from inhibition and hydrolysis studies with the CI2 mutants are presented in Table 1; we report Ki, equivalent to the dissociation constant Kd, and kcat, the overall rate of turnover. We found that mutation of Tyr 61 has a substantially greater impact on CI2 function than mutation of Met 59, consistent with our prediction of the leaving-group importance in the mechanism of inhibition, and that the larger effect of the Tyr 61 mutation is manifest both through an increased inhibition constant, which reflects a decrease in binding affinity, and through an increased rate of enzymatic hydrolysis. From the viewpoint of substrate specificity studies, which have generally shown P1 and P4 to be the most critical positions for subtilisin substrate recognition and attribute lesser importance to the leaving-group residues (6, 7), the greater importance of the P2 residue for both binding and hydrolysis of CI2 is surprising. However, this finding is fully consistent with our mechanism of inhibition. The ratedetermining step in proteolysis of the inhibitor involves hydrolytic attack on the acyl-enzyme complex and product release (k3 in Scheme 1). The consensus model of the serine protease reaction features the hydrolytic water molecule approaching the acyl-enzyme from the face where the leaving group (R) has departed (25-27). In the subtilisin/ CI2 acyl-enzyme, the newly formed R amino terminus must begin to dissociate from the enzyme surface to clear a path for the hydrolytic water molecule. In the wild-type CI2

complex, the interaction between CI2 Tyr 61 and subtilisin Phe 189 favors retention of the newly formed R amino terminus at the enzyme interface, and removal of this favorable interaction by mutation hastens departure of the R leaving group, accelerating turnover. We found that the rate of CI2 hydrolysis correlates inversely with the binding affinity (Figure 2), a correlation consistent with the clogged gutter mechanism of inhibition, although it should be noted that the M59G mutant presents a striking exception to this trend. The rate-determining step in inhibitor turnover involves hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme and subsequent product release. Hydrolysis requires at least partial dissociation of the R side of the CI2-binding loop, as discussed above, and product release requires full dissociation of both R and R sides of the cleaved binding loop. An inhibitor with optimal enzyme complementarity and strong binding affinity in the intact form will likely remain resistant to dissociation as the complex progresses through the acyl-enzyme to the cleaved form, hence, the observed correlation. To determine whether any of the mutations studied had an appreciable effect on the ability of the complex to form an acyl-enzyme, subtilisin BPN was incubated with the variants of CI2 and then acid-quenched, trapping the equilibrium acyl-enzyme population for detection by gel analysis (Figure 3). The acyl-enzyme formation observed with wildtype CI2 was reproduced with the mutant inhibitors, which displayed between 2 and 10% of the acyl-enzyme species, as a proportion of the total enzyme. Again, however, the M59G mutant represents a major departure from the other mutants; no acyl-enzyme species was detected for M59G in any of four replicate assays. Crystal Structures of the CI2 Mutant Complexes. To enable interpretation of the biochemical data for the CI2 mutants in terms of the loss of specific intermolecular interactions involving either the acylating- or leaving-group regions of the CI2-binding loop, it was necessary to verify that no larger structural repercussions had been introduced by the mutations. To that end, X-ray structures, ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 Å resolution, were obtained for complexes of subtilisin BPN with all of the CI2 mutants described. A summary of the data collection and refinement statistics is presented in Table 2. A global structural comparison indicates that no gross changes in the CI2 backbone structure have been introduced

FIGURE 3: Formation of acyl-enzyme between subtilisin BPN and CI2 mutants. (A) Subtilisin BPN samples (8 µg) were incubated with an excess of wild-type or mutant CI2, allowing formation of an equilibrium population of the acyl-enzyme species, acidified to quench enzyme activity and trap the acyl-enzyme, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE; a representative gel is shown. (B) Fraction of the total enzyme represented by the acyl-enzyme was estimated from gels. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean for four or more determinations on replicate gels.

by the mutations (Figure 4A). Superpositions were based on the R-carbon positions of all residues of subtilisin minus the His tag, plus the residues of the CI2-binding loop (residues I56-I61). The residues of the CI2 core were not used in superpositioning, because the junction between the CI2 core and binding loop displays a degree of flexibility, with slight hinge angle variations between the mutant complexes. Average root-mean-square (rms) deviations of R-carbon positions, for the residues used in superpositioning, range from 0.069 Å (between the wild-type and M59A complexes) to 0.117 Å (between the wild-type and M59F complexes). The structural differences between the wild-type complex in two different crystal forms, resulting from different crystal packing interactions, are actually greater than the differences among mutant complexes; the two wild-type structures show an average rms deviation of the R-carbon positions, for the residues used in superpositioning, of 0.271 Å (Figure 4B). The P212121 (3) and P6522 crystal forms differ markedly in the CI2 hinge angle, by 8.1°, and many peripheral loops of subtilisin display subtle displacements. The subtilisin His tag takes on completely different conformations in each of the two crystal forms, indicating that it is most likely unstructured in solution. Structural comparison of the walls of the S1 specificity cleft of subtilisin in the P1 mutant complexes reveals only a small degree of adjustment in the backbones of residues that form the binding subsite, to accommodate the mutated CI2 side chains (Figure 5A). The largest backbone displacements are seen in the complexes with M59Y and M59F, to accommodate these larger aromatic side chains. Maximal displacements relative to the native structure are seen at subtilisin residues 127-128 (up to 0.73 Å) and 166 (0.5 Å), while residues 155-156 show a more subtle displacement (0.25 Å). B-factor analysis gives an indirect indication of the relative flexibility of active-site residues between the

mutant complexes (Figure 5B). The M59G mutant has noticeably higher B factors, indicative of greater flexibility, in the CI2 backbone residues 59 and 60 flanking the scissile bond, in subtilisin residues 125, 153, and 154, comprising the adjacent walls of the S1 cleft, and in the subtilisin Ser 221 side chain. The active-site features, including the catalytic triad and the CI2-binding loop P1 and P1 residues, superpose almost perfectly for all mutants, and the complexes retain the ideal geometry for nucleophilic attack of Ser 221 on the scissile bond (3). Organized water molecules within the S1 cleft of subtilisin play a role in enzyme-inhibitor recognition at the binding interface. The most significant structural effects of the CI2 P1 residue mutations involve modulation of the solvent structure. The larger aromatic P1 side chains of M59Y and M59F extend more deeply into the S1 cleft, excluding two ordered water molecules, S57 and S189; in these structures, a single, completely buried water, S35, remains at the back of the cleft. The smaller or absent side chains of M59A and M59G result in the addition of ordered water molecules to the hydrogen-bonded solvent network in the S1 cleft; M59A sees the addition of S420, while M59G has two added waters, S420 and S421 (Figure 6). The absence of any greater structural consequences of the P1 mutations allows us to clearly attribute the observed increases in Ki and kcat for the mutants directly to the P1 side-chain replacement and solvent restructuring in the S1 cleft. The structure of the Y61A complex similarly confirms that the functional effects of this mutation, reduced binding affinity and increased hydrolysis, result solely from lost favorable contacts between CI2 Tyr 61 and subtilisin Phe 189. In the wild-type complex, the two aromatic side chains form an offset ring-stacking interaction, in which the ring planes are parallel to each other and separated by approximately 3.5 Å. The structure of the Y61A complex is marked by the replacement of the tyrosine side chain with two ordered water molecules, S388 and S492, with almost no change in the surrounding protein structure (Figure 7), echoing our findings with the P1 mutants. The catalytic triad and the CI2-binding loop P1 and P1 residues also superpose closely with those of the wild-type complex, retaining the ideal orientation for nucleophilic attack of Ser 221 on the scissile bond (3).

For all complexes, the P1 and P1 residues of CI2 and the catalytic triad residues of subtilisin are shown in pale colors, where carbons are gray, nitrogens are pale blue, oxygens are pink, and sulfurs are pale yellow. The dotted lines indicate the continuation of the CI2 backbone, and the black arrow indicates the scissile bond. (B) Average B factors are plotted for the main-chain (MC) atoms comprising the walls of the S1 cleft of subtilisin, the main-chain (MC) atoms of CI2 P1 and P1 residues 59 and 60, and the side-chain (SC) atoms of the subtilisin nucleophilic serine, Ser 221. Raw B factors for each structure have been normalized with division by the average protein B factor for that structure, such that a value of 1 corresponds to the average protein B factor for that structure.

The M59G Mutant: Variation on the Clogged Gutter Inhibition Mechanism. M59G is the most weakly bound of the P1 mutants. It would be expected to be the most rapidly hydrolyzed of the P1 mutants according to the binding/ hydrolysis correlation (Figure 2), because the weaker enzymeinhibitor association should make the interface more accessible to the hydrolytic water at the acyl-enzyme stage and

should lead to a more rapid product release. The changes in the scissile bond region dynamics implied by the B-factor analysis of this mutant would likewise suggest greater susceptibility to hydrolysis and dissociation. However, the M59G mutant is as resistant to hydrolysis as wild-type CI2, causing it to appear as a major outlier in the correlation between binding and hydrolysis (Figure 2). A clue to the explanation is found in the gel analysis of acyl-enzyme formation. No acyl-enzyme species was detected for the M59G mutant, suggesting that for this mutant, the primary barrier to proteolysis occurs not at the deacylation stage but earlier. Apparently, the Michaelis complex proceeds less rapidly to the acyl-enzyme, resulting in little buildup of an acyl-enzyme population. The reason for this alteration in the mechanism of inhibition is not apparent from the structure of the M59G complex; the positioning of the subtilisin serine nucleophile relative to the CI2 scissile bond is unchanged in the mutant structure. We are left to speculate that the favorable interactions between a P1 side chain and the S1-binding cleft play a much larger role in stabilizing the tetrahedral transition state and acyl-enzyme intermediate than they do in the

Michaelis complex, and that the absence of a P1 side chain in the M59G mutant is much more destabilizing to the tetrahedral transition state and acyl-enzyme intermediate than it is to the Michaelis complex. This mirrors the situation with subtilisin and a series of peptide succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro[X]-p-nitroanaline substrates, where KM was minimally increased for the P1 glycine substrate relative to good substrates, indicating a modest reduction in binding, while kcat was reduced by over 3 orders of magnitude (Table 3). The literature contains other examples of serine proteases, notably trypsin (28) and Streptomyces griseus protease 1 (29), in which P1 specificity is expressed primarily through kcat rather than KM, revealing a general importance of the substrate P1 residue in stabilizing the transition state. Similarly, for the Saccharomyces cereVisiae protease Kex2, the enzyme-substrate interaction at P1 is used almost entirely for transition-state stabilization of the acylation reaction (30). The M59K Mutant: Significance of Electrostatic Interactions. The Met and Lys P1 side chains and associated water molecules superpose almost perfectly (Figure 8), allowing us to attribute the 6-fold reduction in the binding affinity solely to the introduction of the charged lysine amino group. This charged group has a deleterious effect on the binding affinity despite the fact that it is located near the mouth of

the broad binding cleft and forms hydrogen bonds with two water molecules, S189 and S201. It has been pointed out in the literature that Lys is an alternative preferred P1 residue for subtilisin BPN, although not for subtilisin Carlsberg, as the result of electrostatic interaction between a P1 Lys residue and the carboxylate anion of Glu 156 in the S1-binding cleft of subtilisin BPN (10, 11). Crystallography of a covalent adduct between subtilisin BPN and a putative tetrahedral intermediate analogue, Phe-Ala-Lys-chloromethyl ketone, revealed an ion pair 3.1 Å in length (10), and subtilisin mutagenesis studies showed the electrostatic interaction between Glu 156 and P1 Lys to favor catalysis, lowering the transition-state free energy by 1.8 kcal/mol (11). Our structure of the complex between subtilisin BPN and the M59K CI2 mutant allows us to contrast a Michaelis complex structure with that of the tetrahedral intermediate analogue; the validity of our complex as a model of the Michaelis complex is confirmed by the rapid acylation that we observe. The M59K mutant structure reveals that, in the Michaelis complex, the P1 Lys amine and the Glu 156 carboxylate are separated by 4.3 Å. A water molecule, S201, is 2.9 Å from the P1 Lys amine and 2.3 Å from the Glu 156 carboxylate and could potentially bridge the electrostatic interaction; however, S201 has a relatively diffuse electron density and a B factor slightly higher than the average solvent

Mutations at the Subtilisin/CI2 Interface B factor for this structure. These facts, combined with the solvent-exposed position of the potential ion pair and the observed deleterious effect of the M59K mutation on CI2 binding, make a strong electrostatic interaction unlikely in the Michaelis complex. We eliminated the possibility that the structural variations in our complex might be an artifact of the low crystallization pH by repeating the structure determination on a crystal that had undergone a soak at pH 9; the high pH structure showed no differences. Our findings, when taken together with previous studies (10, 11), suggest that the electrostatic interaction between Glu 156 of subtilisin BPN and a substrate P1 Lys residue is insignificant in the Michaelis complex but becomes important in the transition state and tetrahedral intermediate. Progress along the reaction path towards the transition state may be marked by reorganization of solvent and movement of the charged side chains toward each other, which may serve as a mechanism of transition-state stabilization. Further evidence for this suggestion is found in kinetic studies of peptide substrate hydrolysis by subtilisin BPN; succinyl-Ala-AlaPro-Lys-p-nitroanaline is bound at an order of magnitude more weakly than the equivalent methionine substrate but has a greater kcat (Table 3), indicating that the charged P1 residue contributes more to transition-state stabilization than initial binding. Subtilisin S1 Cleft Discrimination. The data reported here for binding affinities of subtilisin BPN for the CI2 P1 mutants, in combination with the high-resolution structures of the complexes, provide new insight into the specificity of subtilisin and the energetic consequences of replacing buried hydrophobic surface area with ordered solvent at a binding interface. Although the subtilisin S1 binding cleft is often described as ideal for accepting large hydrophobic residues, there appear to be only minor energetic consequences for the replacement of the hydrophobic contacts present when Phe, Tyr, or Met is bound with ordered waters in a hydrogen-bonded network, in the case of a smaller or absent P1 side chain. Even when the bulky hydrophobic P1 residues are bound, a buried water molecule, S35, remains at the bottom of the S1-binding cleft, involved in a network of hydrogen bonds at the enzyme-inhibitor interface. Surprisingly, M59A binds with similar affinity to M59F, revealing that the S1 cleft shows little preference for the aromatic side chain over the 3 water molecules that replace it in the M59A mutant. Involvement of bound waters in molecular recognition of variant P1 residues has been noted for other protease-inhibitor pairs, such as for the complex of Streptomyces griseus proteinase B with the turkey ovomucoid inhibitor third domain (OMTKY) (31) and the complex of bovine trypsin with BPTI (32). Generality of the Clogged Gutter Mechanism. While our studies have been limited to the interaction between subtilisin BPN and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, a comparison of the active sites of many protease-inhibitor complexes reveals that they share a characteristic inhibitor backbone conformation at the enzyme interface and nearly identical geometry for approach of the serine nucleophile to the scissile bond (3). This striking structural similarity suggests that the subtilisin BPN/CI2 complex may be representative of other protein protease inhibitor complexes with respect to the ease of acyl-enzyme formation (3). It is tempting to speculate that retention of the leaving-group peptide, favoring religation

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 43, 2004 13655 of the inhibitor scissile bond, may also be a common feature, giving the clogged gutter mechanism a central role in the function of the classic serine protease inhibitors. However, alternative interpretations could also be considered. For a number of the most intensely studied protease inhibitors, the process of enzyme binding, cleavage, and dissociation has been shown to be fully reversible, resulting in an eventual equilibrium between the intact and cleaved inhibitor, with an equilibrium constant near unity (1, 33). For OMTKY3, Ardelt and Laskowski presented evidence that subtilisin Carlsberg resynthesizes the intact inhibitor from the cleaved form much more rapidly than chymotrypsin or elastase (34). It is possible that the subtilisins but not the chymotrypsin family of proteases create a uniquely favorable environment for religation of the cleaved reactive site bond, explaining both our data and that of Ardelt and Laskowski. The pervasiveness of the clogged gutter mechanism with enzymes and inhibitors beyond subtilisin BPN and CI2 remains to be experimentally explored. Summary of Conclusions. The previously proposed clogged gutter mechanism of CI2 inhibition (3), in which turnover following acylation is slowed by retention of the leaving group in the active site and promotion of inhibitor religation, suggested a testable hypothesis. While the acylating residues are more critical for ordinary substrates, where acylation is rate-limiting, we predicted that leaving-group determinants would be more critical for implementing CI2 inhibition. We found that mutation of Tyr 61 of CI2, which forms the most significant leaving-group contacts with the enzyme, did indeed interfere with the inhibitory function to a greater extent than the mutation of Met 59, the P1 residue that forms the strongest enzyme contacts on the acylating side of the scissile bond. We found that a correlation exists between CI2 hydrolysis and binding, which is completely consistent with rate-determining deacylation and product dissociation. Significantly, CI2 hydrolysis did not correlate with either kcat or kcat/Km for peptide substrates featuring the same P1 residues (data in Table 3), further emphasizing that CI2 hydrolysis is not slowed at the acylation step, which is ratelimiting for the peptide substrates (5). High-resolution crystal structures of the mutant complexes, which show no large shifts in backbone conformation, allowed us to attribute the mutational effects on binding and hydrolysis directly to the loss of very specific intermolecular interactions and reorganization of solvent molecules. Our data also provide fortuitous insight into the catalytic mechanism of subtilisin BPN. In the M59G CI2 mutant, hydrolysis appears to be slowed at the acylation step, despite optimal orientation of the scissile bond and catalytic triad; we interpret this as evidence for the importance of the P1 side chain for transition-state stabilization during acylation. Structural data from the M59K CI2 mutant likewise imply a role for this residue in transition-state stabilization, because electrostatic interactions known to be of importance in catalysis were not in evidence in the ground-state Michaelis complex structure and must therefore evolve along the reaction coordinate.
