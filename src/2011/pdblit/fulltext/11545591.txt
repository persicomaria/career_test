Thus it has been suggested that the crew of the expedition suffered from lead poisoning, because lead containers were used to store water and food, and that the subsequent symptoms of muscle weakness and mental derangement contributed to the demise of the expedition.

Lead poisoning, haem synthesis and 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase
Martin J. Warren, Jon B. Cooper, Stephen P. Wood and Peter M. Shoolingin-Jordan
In mammals and yeast, 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase is a zinc-dependent enzyme that catalyses the synthesis of porphobilinogen ­ the pyrrole building block that is incorporated into all modified tetrapyrroles, including haem, chlorophyll and vitamin B12. The X-ray structure of this enzyme reveals how substitution of the catalytically important zinc ion by lead inactivates the enzyme and causes a form of pseudo-porphyria.

Lead poisoning and haem biosynthesis
Lead poisoning is a complex disorder and affects many organs in the body, including developing red blood cells, the kidneys and the nervous system. One of the most prominent effects is on the biosynthesis of haem, the prosthetic group present in haemoglobin, cytochromes, catalases and peroxidases. It was known for some time that lead affects the biosynthesis of haem, because lead poisoning causes anaemia10. Although the anaemia could have been due to the effect of lead on iron uptake, lead poisoning also causes increased urinary excretion of porphyrins and 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA), the first committed precursor of haem5. Furthermore, the similarity between the symptoms of lead poisoning and acute intermittent porphyria (an inherited disease associated with lesions in the haem biosynthetic enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase) was also noted4. All this suggested that one of the major sites of lead intoxication was the haem biosynthetic pathway. In mammals, haem is synthesized from succinyl-CoA and glycine in eight enzyme-mediated steps (Fig. 1)11. Initially, succinyl-CoA and glycine are condensed by the enzyme 5-aminolaevulinic acid synthase to give carbon dioxide and ALA, in a reaction that requires pyridoxal 5 phosphate as a cofactor. In the next step, two molecules of ALA are condensed by the enzyme 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) to produce a single molecule of porphobilinogen (PBG) in a Knorr-type reaction. Subsequently, four molecules of the pyrrole building block PBG are polymerized by the enzyme PBG deaminase to give the linear 1-hydroxymethylbilane, preuroporphyrinogen; this is then cyclized to form uroporphyrinogen III by the enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase. Uroporphyrinogen III is also an intermediate in the synthesis of other modified tetrapyrroles, such as chlorophyll, sirohaem, vitamin B12 and coenzyme F430 (Ref. 12). However, in order to direct the intermediate towards haem synthesis, the peripheral side chains of the molecule are modified by decarboxylation,

LEAD POISONING IS one of the most common acquired environmental diseases because of the widespread distribution of the metal in Nature and its physical properties, which man has utilized for the past 6000 years1. Nowadays, about 30 million tonnes of lead are produced per year and in excess of 3 million tonnes are emitted into the atmosphere ­ although this figure is falling because of the phasing out of leaded petrol2. The use of lead by the Romans, not only in water-management schemes but also as artificial sweeteners in the form of lead salts, has been used as an explanation for the lower birth rates and the madness of the Roman upper classes (the Patricians), and has been linked to the decline of the Roman Empire3. The clinical symptoms of lead poisoning have been well documented over the years and reflect the toxicity of the metal throughout the body4. Some of the symptoms of lead poisoning, however, are similar to those observed in individuals with acute porphyria5 (the name given to a class of clinical disorders associated with haem biosynthesis). The common symptoms include severe abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, constipation, temporary psychiatric disturbance and elevated excretion of haem biosynthetic intermediates.

In Britain, perhaps one of the bestknown lead-intoxication episodes was the infamous Devonshire colic, which was described by Huxam in 1759 (Ref. 6). The symptoms of this disorder included severe abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, delirium, languor, limb paralysis and grand mal seizures. Sufferers also reported limb and back pain. The cause of this illness was eventually traced to the local cider, which had been contaminated by lead from the cider presses7. Another disastrous episode that has been attributed to lead poisoning, at least in part, was the ill-fated Franklin expedition to the Arctic, in search of the Northwest passage, which set out from England in May 1845. Sir John Franklin led the voyage; he was in charge of two ships, Erebus and Terror, and 128 crewmen. The expedition was extremely well organized ­ Franklin had ample provisions, fresh fruit juice (to prevent scurvy), modern equipment and well-trained officers ­ but no members of the crew ever returned. It is known that the two ships reached Beechey Island and sheltered in the harbour during the winter of 1845­1846. During this period, three crew members died and were buried in the permafrost. The evidence suggests that the remainder of the expedition became disorientated and disorganized, and vanished into the icy wasteland during the subsequent months. An analysis of the frozen and perfectly preserved bodies of the three crew members buried on Beechey Island revealed that they had very high levels of lead in their bodies8. A similar study of the remains of some of the crew found

generating the intermediates coproporphyrinogen III and protoporphyrinogen IX. Finally, oxidation of the macrocycle and iron chelation produce protoporphyrin IX and protohaem, respectively. Generally, a lesion in any gene encoding an enzyme that is involved in the transformation of ALA into protohaem produces a metabolic disturbance of this pathway and causes one of the porphyrias5. Inhibition of the early steps of the pathway leads to the acute porphyrias, which are characterized by severe abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, psychiatric disturbance and excretion of the early intermediates ALA and PBG, in the urine. Dysfunctions of the later enzymes lead to non-acute porphyrias, which are associated with dermatological symptoms caused by the photodynamic properties of porphyrins. These can cause severe inflammation, blistering and scarring, and excretion of large amounts of porphyrins in the urine and faeces. Patients can also suffer some of the symptoms of acute porphyria, and excrete ALA and PBG in the urine. Enzyme studies of the haem pathway have shown that lead is an inhibitor of ALAD, coproporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase5. However, the metal has the greatest effect on ALAD ­ to the extent that measurement of the activity of

218

TIBS 23 ­ JUNE 1998 ALAD can be used as an indicator of lead levels in the blood13. Thus, the action of lead on the enzyme and the subsequent elevated levels of ALA within the system could represent the common cause of the symptoms of lead intoxication and acute porphyria. Although the actual cause of the neuropathy (including abdominal pain and constipation due to the loss of muscle tone that results from inhibition of the autonomic nervous system) is unknown, it has been suggested that ALA acts as a aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist in the nervous system14. octamer is perhaps best described as a tetramer of compact dimers, clipped together by their N-terminal arms, that interact to form an octamer with a large solvent-filled cavity in the centre. There are eight independent active sites, each of which is oriented towards the outer surface of the octamer. In the yeast enzyme, the active-site lysine (Lys263), which forms the Schiff base, lies parallel to another lysine (Lys210) and both are surrounded by a number of phylogenetically invariant residues, including several tyrosines.

5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase
In yeasts and mammals, ALAD is a homo-octamer (see Fig. 2); each subunit has a Mr of 35 000 and the enzyme requires zinc for catalytic activity15,16. In some bacteria and all plant enzymes, magnesium substitutes for zinc17,18. ALAD catalyses the synthesis of PBG from two molecules of ALA via a number of covalently bound enzyme intermediates (Fig. 3). Initially, the first substrate molecule binds to an active-site lysine, forming a Schiff base. Single turn-over experiments have shown that this ALA molecule forms the propionate-chain side of PBG19. The second molecule of ALA then forms the acetate-chain side of the pyrrole group. The active site of the enzyme is thus envisaged to contain P (propionate) and A (acetate) substrate-binding sites. The full reaction mechanism has not been elucidated; however, it is known to require nucleophilic attack by the amino group of the P substrate on the carbonyl group of the A substrate, and an aldol condensation between C-3 of the A substrate and the Schiff base at the P site20. Steric and mechanistic considerations suggest that the aldol condensation occurs first. Zinc (or magnesium) acts as a Lewis acid in the polarization of the carbonyl group during pyrrole synthesis. Recently the structure of yeast ALAD has been determined using X-ray crystallography21. The structure has highlighted a number of active-site groups, as well as the metal-binding sites. Furthermore, the structure also allows an insight into the effect of point mutations that are known to cause the very rare, recessive ALAD deficiency, Doss porphyria5.

TIBS 23 ­ JUNE 1998 erentially bind at the B site (Fig. 5b). Lead could inhibit the enzyme either by steric obstruction or by its inability to function as a Lewis acid in catalysis ­ which could be a consequence of its charge : density ratio. In photosynthetic organisms and certain bacteria, including Bradyrhizobium japonicum, the three cysteine residues that make up the B site are absent and are replaced by alanine and aspartate residues. This is consistent with the ability of these ALADs to bind magnesium18,23. It is possible to change the metal specificity of these magnesiumdependent enzymes from magnesium to zinc by changing these alanine and aspartate residues to cysteine residues23,24. Significantly, the mutagenized proteins also become much more sensitive to inhibition by lead24.

The 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase active site
The active sites of all ALADs are described in terms of A and P substratebinding sites, in order to differentiate between the two identical substrates that are used in the synthesis of PBG. The active site of ALAD contains a number of functional groups that define these two sites. Lys263 (yeast ALAD numbering) forms a Schiff base with the substrate at the P site; Lys210 (yeast ALAD numbering) is probably involved in lowering the pKa of the enzyme (see Fig. 4). The substrate-binding sites are lined with a number of tyrosine residues, which could be involved in general acid­base chemistry. A more precise role for these residues will no doubt be provided by a structure of the enzyme with substrate analogues bound at the active site. Structurally, ALAD is similar to type I and type II aldolases, because these proteins are largely based on a TIMbarrel architecture25,26.

Figure 5 Metal binding to 5-aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD). (a) The position of the main zinc-binding site is highlighted within an ALAD monomer. The metal ion is coordinated by three cysteine residues (Cys133, Cys135 and Cys143; shown in green). (b) In the presence of lead, zinc is displaced from ALAD, and the main metal-binding site (coordinated by Cys133, Cys135 and Cys143) becomes occupied by lead. A minor lead-binding site appears to involve just two of the cysteine residues (Cys135 and Cys143), which probably take up alternative conformations. The two catalytic lysine residues (Lys210 and Lys263) are visible on the right-hand side of the picture.

Doss porphyria
As mentioned earlier, inherited dysfunctions in haem biosynthetic enzymes give rise to a number of conditions that are referred to as the porphyrias. Although most of these conditions are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and display only partial penetrance, hereditary dysfunctions in ALAD are recessive and are extremely rare5. ALAD porphyria (or Doss porphyria) is characterized by excessive accumulation of ALA and acute attacks of severe pain27. Individuals who inherit this condition, as well as their carrier parents and other heterozygotes for ALAD deficiency, show

non-catalytic role for the B-site zinc ion was inferred, because the ion was thought to be coordinated by four cysteine residues, although this site could be responsible for abstraction of the proR proton that is lost from the P-side ALA during catalysis17. It is apparent from the X-ray-derived structure of yeast ALAD that one zincbinding site is present in the active site of each subunit of the enzyme (Fig. 5a). The binding site contains three cysteine residues ­ the fourth coordination position is taken either by a water molecule

or by a hydroxide ion ­ and corresponds to the previously identified B site. A second less well-defined zinc-binding site appears to be made up of a histidine residue and a cysteine residue, but is further from the catalytic site. The proximity of the B site to Lys263 suggests that the former plays a more prominent role in catalysis than was previously suspected. Certainly, lead is thought to bind to ALAD through cysteine residues, which makes it more likely that it binds at the B site. Indeed co-crystallization of yeast ALAD revealed that lead does pref-

TIBS 23 ­ JUNE 1998 greater sensitivity to environmental and dietary lead. Modelling of the known mutations that cause ALAD porphyria suggests that they induce structural changes in the enzyme. In humans, ALAD is found in relative abundance in comparison with the other haem biosynthetic enzymes, which might explain why mutations in the enzyme are associated with a recessive disease. However, in humans, ALAD could also play another role in the cell ­ as the CF-2 regulatory component of the 26S proteasome28. The regulatory components of the proteasome combine with the central, catalytic 20S particle to control and regulate the ubiquitin-tagged proteolytic degradation process. Although the structure of the yeast 20S particle has been determined recently29, it is not known how the regulatory components interact. Nonetheless, if ALAD is proved to be the CF-2 component of the proteasome, this will represent a remarkable example of gene sharing28.

Full circle
The similarity between the symptoms of lead poisoning and acute porphyria has undoubtedly bemused many physicians, albeit unwittingly, including Sir George Baker. His most famous patient was King George III, who complained of abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy and had several well-recorded attacks of `madness' ­ for which Sir George could offer no explanation. The King was diagnosed, retrospectively, with acute intermittent porphyria30,31. Prior to his elevation to head of the Royal physicians, Sir George was the physician who demonstrated that the Devonshire colic was due to lead contamination from the cider presses7!
