Crystallisation, data collection and structure solution Crystals (1) and (2) of human MMP-12, already containing AHA from the refolding process, grew at 20º C from a 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 30% PEG 6000, 2 mM NaN3 (in (2) only) , 200 mM AHA solution at pH 8.0 using the vapour diffusion technique. The final protein concentration was around 8 mg/ml. The crystals appeared in few days, but the crystal growth was difficult and only tiny rods of approximately 0.2 x 0.06 x 0.06 mm were obtained. Complete X-ray datasets were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation from the ESRF ID29 beamline (Grenoble, France); the crystals used for data collection was cryo-cooled without any cryo-protectant treatment. The crystals diffracted to a maximum resolution of 1.85 Å (1) and 2.0 Å (2) and belonged to space group P31 with a= b= 125.44 Å, c= 72.34 Å, = = 90º, = 120º for (1) and a= b= 123.84 Å, c= 69.73 Å, = = 90º, = 120º for (2), and six molecules in the asymmetric unit in both cases. Table I shows the data collection and processing statistics. The data were processed using the program MOSFLM[1] and merged with SCALA[2]. The structures were solved using the molecular replacement technique; the model used was that of a monomer of human MMP-12 complexed with the inhibitor batimastat (PDB-code 1JK3) from which the inhibitor, all the water molecules and ions were omitted[3]. The correct orientation and translation of the molecule within the crystallographic unit cell was determined with standard Patterson search techniques[47]

as implemented in the program MOLREP[8; 9]. The program provided an evident

solution for the positioning for the six molecules in the asymmetric unit with a correlation factor of 0.7 and a R-factor of 0.32 for (1) and a correlation factor of 0.7 and a R-factor of 0.35 for (2). The Rcryst and Rfree after molecular replacement were 0.32 and 0.36 for (1) and 0.35 and 0.38 for (2). The refinement was carried out using REFMAC5[10; 11] and the model building among the various refinement cycles with XtalView[12]. The final Rcryst and Rfree were 0.19 and 0.24 for (1) and 0.21 and 0.26 for (2). The Ramachandran plots are of good quality considering the maximum resolution. For (1), 92.3% of residues were in the most favoured regions, 6.8% in additional allowed regions, 0.5% in generously allowed regions and only 0.4% (belonging to the

2

C-termini) in disallowed regions while for (2) 89.5% of residues were in the most favoured regions, 9.0% in additional allowed regions, 0.9% in generously allowed regions and only 0.5% (belonging to the C-termini) in disallowed regions. Table II shows the refinement statistics.
