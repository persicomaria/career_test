Triiodide derivatization and combinatorial counter-ion replacement: two methods for enhancing phasing signal using laboratory Cu Ka X-ray equipment
A series of experiments performed at Cu K wavelength on in-house X-ray equipment are presented which investigate two possibilities for enhancing the experimental phasing signal by means of (i) triiodide/iodide soaks using KI/I2 and (ii) combinations of counter-ions introduced using the short cryosoak method. Triiodide-derivative crystal structures for ®ve test proteins have been re®ned and reveal that iodine can bind as polyiodide and single iodide ions through hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions both at the molecular surface and in intramolecular and intermolecular cavities. In three cases, the structures could be automatically determined with autoSHARP using in-house SAD and SIRAS data. The investigation of combinatorial counter-ion replacement using multiple salts with Na+ and Cs+ as cations and IÀ and ClÀ as anions reveals that, for the case of hen egg-white lysozyme, signi®cant improvement in phasing signal is obtained by the combined use of salts compared with SIRAS methods using native and single short-soak derivative data sets.

1. Introduction
The isomorphous replacement (IR 1) method (Green et al., 1954; Crick & Magdoff, 1956), which played a key role in the birth of protein crystallography, has seemed over the last decade to inexorably lose ground to the MAD method. There is, however, evidence that the very same advances which made the implementation of the MAD method possible could now support the re-emergence of IR by allowing the exploitation of versatile chemical interactions which were previously unsuitable for derivatization. The work of Dauter & Dauter (1999), Dauter et al. (2000) and Nagem et al. (2001) has demonstrated that short soaks in solutions containing halide ions (BrÀ, IÀ) and certain cations (Cs+, Gd3+) can produce suf®cient derivatization to support de novo structure determination by exploiting IR and/or anomalous scattering (AS) effects on a synchrotron source tuned to the Cu K wavelength. In this paper, we present an investigation of the potential usefulness of these methods using conventional laboratory equipment (Cu rotating-anode generators and image-plate or CCD detectors) and extend them in two main directions: (i) towards the use of combinatorial counter-ion replacement, which mimics the MAD method by chemical means, and (ii)

Triiodide derivatization and combinatorial counter-ion replacement

research papers
the systematic investigation of the triiodide ion, a versatile derivatization agent which can display a spectrum of behaviours ranging from ionic to hydrophobic, mimicking Xe gas in the latter. It is concluded that a renaissance of IR can be expected in the near future, which ought to yield high-quality phase information at low cost on in-house equipment and may create new demands for medium-energy synchrotron beamlines. compounds, as well as potentially more aggressive compounds, become eligible. Furthermore, the freezing of crystals makes it possible to collect highly redundant diffraction data, which leads to an increased isomorphous and/or anomalous signal-to-noise ratio. Similarly, the improvements in detector technology, through the use of CCDs and image plates, have made the measurements of diffraction intensities more accurate, so that smaller intensity differences have become potential sources of phasing signals.
2.2. Heavy-atom detection methods

2. Logistics of heavy-atom phasing: key factors and trends
The classical image of heavy-atom derivatization of protein crystals in the isomorphous replacement and related methods has been superseded in the last few years. Traditionally, the preparation of isomorphous derivatives would involve long soaks in typically sub-millimolar solutions of heavy-atom compounds. The eligible compounds needed to be nonaggressive over long time periods, as samples would be used later for X-ray data collection at room temperature (at least before the introduction of crystal freezing). In addition, the heavy-atom substitution had to be sparse and clean because early heavy-atom detection methods could not routinely determine the positions of large numbers of sites. To ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio in isomorphous and anomalous differences, the substitution also had to be strong and the sites were required to be well ordered. These stringent requirements were dif®cult to meet and were a signi®cant motivation for the development of alternative methods of introducing heavy atoms into protein crystals, such as the incorporation of Se atoms into proteins by expressing them in selenomethionine-containing media (Hendrickson et al., 1990; Â, Doublie 1997). Over the last decade, however, advances in the ®eld of macromolecular crystallography have allowed the problem of producing heavy-atom derivatives to be viewed from a fresh perspective. These advances have been (i) the fast freezing of crystals to cryogenic temperatures, (ii) the improvements in detector technology and X-ray sources, (iii) the dramatic improvements in crystallographic software for the determination of heavy-atom substructures with large numbers of atoms and (iv) the appearance of powerful maximumlikelihood heavy-atom re®nement and phasing programs and of automated density-modi®cation procedures.
2.1. Crystal freezing and detectors

Software for the detection of heavy atoms using isomorphous and/or anomalous signals in diffraction data has recently improved to the point where heavy-atom substructures of over 100 atoms may be solved. A decade ago, derivatives yielding numerous weak binding sites would have been deemed to be `non-speci®c' and of little use in structure determination. Nowadays, such heavy-atom substructures are solvable by dual-space direct-methods approaches, as implemented in Shake-and-Bake (Miller et al., 1994; Smith et al., Â 1998) and SHELXD (Uson & Sheldrick, 1999).
2.3. Heavy-atom refinement and phasing methods

Finally, developments in heavy-atom re®nement and phasing software have allowed weak signals to be utilized through the use of maximum-likelihood (ML) methods and statistical descriptions of lack of isomorphism and heavy-atom model imperfection (de La Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997). Loglikelihood gradient maps (Bricogne, 1993) resulting from ML re®nement can also identify additional heavy-atom sites, starting from very few initially detected sites. The inclusion of such information over several iterations can considerably improve the quality of experimental phases, which in turn enhance the effectiveness of density-modi®cation programs such as DM and SOLOMON. In recent years, this methodology has been shown to be effective in the extreme case of sulfur single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (S-SAD), in which the sole AS signal from S atoms present in cysteine and methionine residues acts as a source of phasing information. This was illustrated by S-SAD results on three test cases: thaumatin (de La Fortelle, Graves & Bricogne, unpublished results), hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL; Dauter et al., 1999) and -trypsin (Yang & P¯ugrath, 2001).
2.4. Short-soak experiments

The ability to routinely freeze crystals (Hope, 1988) has had a profound effect on the scope of soaking methods for preparing heavy-atom derivatives. The macromolecular crystals need no longer be stable in heavy-atom solutions over long time periods. Crystals may therefore be soaked in heavyatom compounds and ¯ash-frozen before the crystal integrity is challenged. Crystal freezing essentially halts the sometimes vigorous effects that heavy-atom compounds may have on protein crystals, so that higher concentrations of heavy-atom

A key observation made by Dauter et al. (1999) was that a signi®cant additional source of AS in HEWL, besides the S atoms, arose from bound ClÀ ions at the surface of the protein. Indeed, experiments showed that the anomalous signal from HEWL could even be enhanced by the introduction of BrÀ ions (Dauter & Dauter, 1999). The accessibility of the Br K absorption edge to synchrotron radiation meant that a MAD experiment could be performed, although a single wavelength was actually suf®cient to produce electron-density maps of a

very high quality. Further studies ensued and led to the development of the short-cryosoak method of halide incorporation into protein crystals (Dauter et al., 2000). The number of bound halide ions was typically large and the sites had varying degrees of occupation. The short-cryosoak method of heavy-atom derivative preparation takes full advantage of the technical advances discussed above. The method involves soaking the crystal for 10±60 s in a solution containing both cryoprotectant and a high concentration of halide salts. The crystals are then frozen and are ready for immediate data collection or storage. (1995) observed ordered binding when using high concentrations of heavy-atom salts to induce changes in the scattering properties of the solvent region in MASC (multiplewavelength anomalous solvent contrast) experiments. Inhouse low-resolution contrast-variation studies (Evans et al., 2000) performed on HEWL using high concentrations of NaCl, NaI, CsCl and CsI (unpublished results) have shown that some surface-binding sites are shared among different counter-ions of like charge. Indeed, recent work by Nagem et al. (2001) has demonstrated that NaI, CsCl and GdCl3 salts at high concentrations can be used to produce phase information using the exchange of one type of counter-ion for another. This only produces relatively weak amplitude differences, but these authors were able to overcome this limitation by collecting highly redundant data sets on synchrotron sources tuned to the Cu K wavelength. We decided to investigate an alternative possibility of enhancing the phasing power of such weak differences which would be applicable to data collected on laboratory X-ray sources. We chose to exploit the similarities of chemical behaviour between different alkali-metal cations on the one hand and different halide anions on the other, which result in their binding at essentially the same sites on the protein surface. In this way, even when using ®xed-wavelength radiation, site-speci®c changes in heavy-atom scattering power can be induced by purely chemical means, which mimics the physically induced changes of f H and f HH on which the MAD method is based. The studies were performed on crystals of HEWL and the results reported in x5.1 show that phase information of very high quality can indeed be obtained in this way, with great economy of means.
3.2. Use of triiodide as a broad-spectrum derivatization agent

3. New strategies for in-house heavy-atom phasing
The SAD and SIRAS methods are well suited to synchrotron sources, where the wavelength may be chosen to optimize AS contributions from the substructure. In fact, the use of SAD phasing with synchrotrons is well described in the literature (Rice et al., 2000; Brodersen et al., 2000; Dauter & Dauter, 1999; Yu-dong et al., 1999; Harvey et al., 1998). There are, on the other hand only, a few examples in the literature of successful SAD experiments performed in-house with Cu K radiation (Chen et al., 1991; Yang & P¯ugrath, 2001). The lack of tunability of Cu-anode laboratory sources is somewhat Ê compensated for by the magnitudes of AS factors at 1.5418 A for many elements. All elements with atomic number > 46 have f HH > 3.7 e. In addition, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co have f HH > 2.4 e. Thus, a large number of candidate heavy atoms, such as some ®rst transition-series metals, Cd, I, Xe, Cs, the lanthanides, the third transition-series metals, Tl and Pb, may act as signi®cant sources of anomalous scattering using Cu K radiation. However, the inability to optimize AS signals and the poorer average signal-to-noise ratios of in-house data impose limitations on the in-house SAD method. This can be overcome to some extent by including native crystal data (SIRAS) in the phase determination. As long as the non-isomorphism between native and derivative samples is small, it can be statistically modelled by phasing programs such as SHARP. In this paper, two possible strategies for enhancing phasing signals using in-house Cu K radiation are investigated. Firstly, the modi®cation of the AS signal in a predictable way by the replacement of counter-ions is examined and the results of phasing using multiple counter-ion combinations are compared with those obtained by conventional SIRAS methods. Secondly, we extend previous studies using triiodide (IÀ introduced into the sample as KI/I2) to protein derivati3 zation for the speci®c purpose of phasing in-house with Cu K radiation, where iodine provides signi®cant AS power. These strategies take advantage of the methodology described in the previous section in order to enhance the phasing signal in SAD, SIRAS and MIRAS phasing.
3.1. Combinatorial counter-ion replacement

The binding of cations and/or anions to the surface of proteins has been observed and studied by a number of authors (Badger et al., 1994; Gursky et al., 1992). Fourme et al.

In studies described by Dauter & Dauter (2001), the iodide ion ± the most promising halide ion for work at the Cu K wavelength ± was unfortunately found to be the most deleterious to protein crystals. The work reported here shows that this dif®culty may be overcome by exploiting a speci®c feature of the chemistry of iodine: the existence of the IÀ ion and 3 higher polyiodide ions IÀ . n One of the earliest uses of iodine in labelling protein crystals was reported by Bluhm et al. (1958). They described the effect of IÀ ions on myoglobin. Their aim was in fact to iodi3 nate the tyrosine residues, but instead they observed binding of IÀ in a hydrophobic cavity bounded on one side by the 3 haem group. This site coincided with the observed position of a bound HgIÀ group in myoglobin co-crystallized with K2HgI4 3 as reported by Bluhm et al. (1958) and Kretsinger et al. (1968). The latter authors were able to determine that HgIÀ binds to 3 metmyoglobin in two sites of differing character: an internal site, being the hydrophobic cavity near the haem group, and an external site, which was interacting through electrostatic forces. The observation of Schoenborn et al. (1965) that xenon was binding in the same position in myoglobin as one of the I atoms of the HgIÀ molecule led them to suggest that the 3

Triiodide derivatization and combinatorial counter-ion replacement

binding of both Xe and I atoms in the internal site is mediated by dispersion forces, which are a consequence of the large polarizabilities of these atoms. Iodine has been used in the derivatization of protein crystals in numerous forms. Among the most common forms of iodine compounds used are KI (Li et al., 1997), KI/I2 (Sigler, 1970), HgIÀ (Kretsinger, 1968; Kretsinger et al., 1968) and the 3 replacement of thymine by 5-iododeoxyuracil (Nolte et al., 1998). Iodine has also been used in crystallographic studies of peroxidases (Fukuyama et al., 1995). The iodination of tyrosine residues in a crystal structure has been successfully attempted by Sigler (1970) and Ghosh et al. (1999). In the latter case, the presence of three almost fully occupied I atoms per 207 amino acids allowed the structure of acetylxylan Ê esterase to be determined by SIRAS to 1.8 A. An example of the potential of iodine as a signi®cant source of AS on conventional Cu K sources was provided by Chen et al. (1991), who used an iodinated dipeptide substrate to solve the structure of bovine neurophysin II with single-wavelength anomalous data. These various authors were only able to identify two cases in which iodine was bound as triiodide ions (IÀ ), namely in the crystal structures of Arthromyces ramosus 3 peroxidase (Fukuyama et al., 1995) and sperm-whale metmyoglobin (Kretsinger, 1968). The following sections are devoted to the presentation of a series of experiments which assess the potential bene®ts of combinatorial counter-ion replacement and triiodide derivatization as phasing methods using conventional X-ray equipment. APO was purchased from Sigma Chemicals (A3641; Lot No. 88H70152) and crystallized using CdSO4 as a crystallizing agent. The conditions described by Granier et al. (1997) were used as guidelines for the preparation. Drops were set up as a matrix of varying protein concentration (10±40 mg mlÀ1 protein in 0.1 M NaCl) and varying Cd2+ concentration [7±12 mM CdSO4, 1 M (NH4)2SO4, 3 mM NaN3]. 10 ml drops consisting of equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir solution were suspended above 1 ml reservoirs. Small crystals belonging top space group F432 (unit-cell parameters Ê a = b = c = 181.74 A) and size <50 mm appeared within a few days but grew to 200 mm or larger over a period of weeks. The crystals were cryoprotected prior to mounting in the liquidnitrogen gas stream by soaking in a solution of 1.25 M (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM CdSO4, 25% ethylene glycol. XI was purchased from Hampton Research as a 33 mg mlÀ1 protein solution. This was further diluted to produce drops of 25 mg mlÀ1 protein, 0.9 M (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM Tris±HCl pH 7.5. 10 ml drops were suspended above 1 ml of reservoir solution [1.8 M (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM Tris±HCl pH 7.5]. Crystals of space group I222 (unit-cell parameters a = 92.27, b = 98.46, Ê c = 102.38 A) and size 0.15±0.25 mm appeared within a few days and were cryoprotected by soaking in a solution of 1.8 M (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM Tris±HCl pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2 and 1.86 M l-xylose. In this case the l-xylose acted as an effective cryoprotectant, while MgCl2 was necessary in order to maintain the stability and integrity of the crystals (Carrell et al., 1989). PPE was purchased from SERVA GmbH, Heidelberg and crystallized by sitting-drop vapour diffusion using 5% PPE dissolved in 0.1 M CH3COONa pH 5.0 and 0.02% NaN3, with 10 mM CH3COONa pH 5.0 and 10 mM Na2SO4 as precipitant. Crystals of space group P212121 (unit-cell parameters a = 50.15, Ê b = 57.90, c = 74.56 A), having approximate dimensions 0.3 Â 0.1 Â0.1 mm, appeared within 48 h. The cryosolution contained 1 mM Na2SO4, 10 mM CH3COONa pH 5.0 and 28%(v/v) glycerol. ABF was crystallized in space group P212121 (unit-cell Ê parameters a = 36.54, b = 70.74, c = 82.12 A) in 1.0 M LiSO4, 0.5 M (NH4)2SO4 and 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer pH 7.5. The crystals used were $0.2 mm in each dimension.
4.2. HEWL counter-ion derivative preparation

4. Materials and methods
The work was carried out using ®ve test proteins: hen eggwhite lysozyme (HEWL), apoferritin from horse spleen (APO), xylose isomerase from Streptomyces rubiginosus (XI), elastase from porcine pancreas (PPE) and an antibody fragment (ABF) kindly supplied by Leo James of the MRC Centre for Protein Engineering. Hanging-drop vapour diffusion (McPherson, 1982) was used to crystallize all the proteins, apart from PPE which was crystallized using sitting drops.
4.1. Crystallization

HEWL was crystallized according to protocols developed by N. Duke of the Structural Biology Center, Argonne National Laboratory (personal communication). The drop consisted of 7.5 ml reservoir solution (2 M NaCl, 0.025 M CH3COONa pH 4.7, 25% ethylene glycol) and 7.5 ml protein solution (100 mg mlÀ1 HEWL, 0.1 M CH3COONa, 0.1% NaN3). The drop was usually seeded with a dilute solution of fragments of a crystal grown in similar conditions. A crystal was broken up into seeds by vortexing it in 0.5 ml stabilizing solution (4 M NaCl, 0.1 M CH3COONa) for 3 min in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube along with a 3 mm PTFE ball (Luft & DeTitta, 1999). Crystals of space group P43212 (unit-cell Ê parameters a = b = 78.84, c = 36.81 A), approximately 0.2±0.3 mm in size, appeared within 24 h.

Three HEWL derivatives were prepared using the shortsoak method. In each case, the cryosoaking solution contained 2.5 M NaCl, 50 mM CH3COONa and 25% ethylene glycol plus 0.5 M NaI, CsCl or CsI. Each crystal was soaked for 30 s in its respective cryosolution. The soak time was determined to be the upper limit after which time the integrity of the crystals, as judged by their appearance, was challenged by the heavy-atom salts. The presence of 2.5 M NaCl along with the other salts was found to be essential for maintaining good diffraction quality. This was also observed by Dauter & Dauter (2001) when using KI to soak HEWL and xylanase. In the case of HEWL, this is explained by the known involvement of Na+ and ClÀ ions in maintaining the structural stability of the molecule and crystal lattice (Sauter et al., 2001; Dauter et al., 1999).

4.3. Triiodide-derivative preparation

For HEWL, APO, XI and PPE, the triiodide derivatives were prepared by cryosoaking the crystals in cryosolutions containing a small concentration of KI/I2. A stock solution of KI/I2 was prepared by dissolving 1 g KI in 4 ml of water and then adding 0.54 g I2. This gave approximate ®nal concentrations of 0.47 M I2 and 0.67 M KI. Typically, this solution was then added to protein mother liquor or cryosoaking solution diluted 50±100 times such that iodine was present in $5±10 mM quantities. The cryosoak drop size was typically 15±20 ml. The cryosoak derivatization conditions are given in Table 1. For ABF, the KI/I2 derivative was prepared by preparing a 10%(v/v) solution of KI/I2 in glycerol and then adding 0.8 ml of this directly to a 4 ml drop containing crystals. The drop was left until a signi®cant change from colourless crystal to dark yellow/brown had been observed; the crystal was then mounted directly in the Cryostream. In all cases, the uptake of iodine from the drop into the crystal was clearly visible as a darkening of the crystal from clear to pale yellow through to brown, while the drop generally lightened in colour. This was a strong indicator of binding of iodine, in whatever form, to the macromolecules in the crystal as opposed to mere penetration by the iodine into the crystal's solvent channels. The crystal was generally left soaking until the colour change in the crystal was seen to stabilize or as long as the crystal could tolerate the solution without visibly starting to degrade. No back-soaking of the crystals to an iodine-free solution was attempted because no signi®cant increase in background scatter was observed in the derivative crystal diffraction compared with that of the native. All samples were mounted directly from the cryoderivatization solution into the nitrogen-gas stream in preparation for data collection.
4.4. Data collection and analysis

a RigakuMSC RU-300/Osmic multilayer/AFC9 goniometer and Jupiter CCD detector. These three setups are respectively referred to as GXIP, RIP and RCC, respectively, throughout this paper. Diffraction images were integrated using either MOSFLM or d*TREK and scaling was performed with SCALA from the CCP4 suite. The conversion from d*TREK integrated and pro®le-®tted re¯ection lists to a multi-record MTZ format ®le suitable for input into SCALA was performed with an inhouse modi®ed version of the CCP4 program ABSURD. The modi®cations allow all of the goniometric information to be carried through into the SCALA program and therefore permit full use of the spherical harmonic correction feature within SCALA to deal with systematic errors arising from sample absorption. Heavy-atom detection, heavy-atom re®nement, phase calculation and solvent ¯attening were performed using the autoSHARP procedure, which makes use of RANTAN, SHARP, SOLOMON and the CCP4 suite. Literature references for the computer programs used are given in Table 2. For the combinatorial counter-ion experiments on HEWL, highly complete and redundant diffraction data were Ê measured from each sample between $20 and 1.9 A resolution. For the native crystal, a complete set of diffracted Ê intensities from 55.8 to 1.9 A was measured. The results of data analysis with MOSFLM and SCALA are summarized in Table 3. For the triiodide derivatives, diffraction data measured from native and KI/I2-soaked derivatives of XI, ABF, HEWL, PPE and APO were measured using conventional X-ray apparatus. The data were analysed as described in x4.4 and the results are given in Table 4.

All the experiments were performed on rotating Cu anode X-ray sources. Three experimental setups were used: (i) an Elliot GX-13 with Supper mirrors (Charles Supper Company, Natick, MA, USA) and MAR 30 cm IP, (ii) a Rigaku RU-200 ®tted with Osmic multilayer optics and a MAR345 IP and (iii)

building. The results of these steps are summarized in Table 6 and the steps are described in more detail below. In each case, the success of the autoSHARP procedure was based on its ability to build correct portions of the model into the ®nal solvent-¯attened map. The correctness of heavy-atom site determination by RANTAN was judged on the ability of SHARP to re®ne the heavy-atom site parameters to sensible and physical values, i.e. B factors not signi®cantly greater that the average protein temperature factor and substantial fractional occupancies. 5.2.1. XI. The scaled structure factors from the KI/I2-soaked XI crystal were fed into autoSHARP as a SAD data set. A correct heavy-atom structure solution was found only when Ê the data was truncated from 1.55 to 2.0 A. In this way, ten heavy-atom sites were found and used as input to SHARP. Automatic interpretation of SHARP residual maps rejected two sites and identi®ed 17 new sites. SHARP jobs using 25 sites were then run using both possible hands. Solvent ¯attening using SOLOMON as implemented in SHARP was run on experimental electron-density maps from each hand. The correlation coef®cients on E2 clearly indicated the correct solution and the solvent-¯attened map was ®nally used with warpNtrace (ARP/wARP) to automatically build the structure Ê to 2 A using the known amino-acid sequence. Using the 25 sites found by autoSHARP, SHARP was run Ê with all data between 32 and 1.55 A. The SHARP residual maps identi®ed 11 additional sites. One of the new sites was Ê positioned directly between two existing sites at about 2 A from each. This cluster of three was interpreted as a triiodide molecule. Solvent ¯attening of the resulting experimental phases resulted in a map into which ARP/wARP traced 376 out of 388 residues in three sections running from 4±186, 189±243 and 247±386. The Ramachandran plot showed only ®ve non-glycine residues lying outside the allowed regions. Ê 5.2.2. ABF. All data between 26.82 and 1.86 A resolution were used as input to autoSHARP. Initially, RANTAN found 12 heavy-atom sites which were used in a ®rst round of heavyatom re®nement in SHARP. Automatic inspection of the residual maps from SHARP resulted in the rejection of ®ve sites and the inclusion of four new sites. A second SHARP re®nement using these 11 sites was followed by solvent¯attening optimization, which determined the correct hand of the heavy-atom solution. The solvent-¯attened electrondensity map allowed ARP/wARP to build 142 residues out of a total of 236 in 16 separate chains.

At this stage, the SHARP residual maps were inspected by hand. After adding new sites and rejecting sites with very low Ê occupancy or very high B factors (>100 A2), the total number of sites was brought to 20. Although no new signi®cant features appeared in the residual maps, it was possible to identify two of the existing anomalous scattering sites as S Ê atoms involved in a disul®de bridge. The atoms were 2.01 A Ê apart. Their re®ned occupancies (B factors) of 0.065 (9.8 A2) Ê and 0.098 (22.7 A2) supported this conclusion. The sites were therefore included as S atoms and further heavy-atom re®nement was performed. A ®nal experimental map produced using a total of 20 heavy-atom sites in SHARP was input to SOLOMON and then ARP/wARP. A model consisting of 210 residues in ®ve separate chains was automatically built and docked into the protein sequence. The ®nal ARP/wARP conventional and free R factors obtained with REFMAC were 20.1 and 24.6%, respectively.

5.2.3. PPE. It was necessary in this case to use a native data set of PPE along with data from the KI/I2-soaked crystal to perform SIRAS phase determination. Again, the autoSHARP Ê protocol was used with native data extending to 1.63 A and Ê . RANTAN initially found two heavyderivative data to 1.85 A atom sites using the anomalous differences for the derivative data and, after an initial SHARP run, three additional sites were added to the heavy-atom model based on residual map peaks. The hand of the heavy-atom model was correctly selected on the basis of E2 correlation coef®cients, but the resulting map was not of suf®cient quality to allow automatic building with ARP/wARP. Manual inspection of the residual maps showed evidence of anisotropy in the three strongest iodine sites. Thus, an additional round of heavy-atom re®nement using anisotropic B values was performed, after which two new sites were identi®ed in the isomorphous residual map. Solvent ¯attening with these phases produced an electrondensity map into which ARP/wARP was able to build 219/240 residues as six polypeptide chains.

6. Crystallographic model refinement
In order to determine accurate positions and occupancies of bound I atoms, the structures of the various KI/I2 derivative crystals were re®ned using the BUSTER/TNT program. The following general protocol was used in each case. After initial rounds of rigid-body re®nement to position the molecule correctly, successive rounds of positional and B-factor re®nement were performed. In general, the occupancies of all atoms except iodine were ®xed to unity and all B factors were re®ned. The iodides and polyiodides were re®ned as independent atoms without the use of IÐI bond-distance restraints. After each run, water molecules were added to the model in Fo À Fc electron-density peaks greater than 4' until all clearly identi®able and chemically sensible water molecules had been placed. At each stage of re®nement, the current phase set was used to calculate anomalous difference Fourier (ADF) maps. Peaks in the ADF maps greater than 4' were classi®ed as I atoms and included in the model. The results of all ®ve re®nements are summarized in Table 5.
6.1. XI KI/I2

Ê The protein atom coordinates of the 1.6 A re®ned structure of Carrell et al. (1989) retrieved from the PDB (code 1xib) were used to provide an initial model. A total of 347 water molecules were added to this model and two l-xylose molecules were also identi®ed in the electron density. The ®rst of these was bound in the active site in the position where d-xylose is thought to bind (Whitaker et al., 1995). The second xylose molecule was found bound to the surface of the protein, making hydrogen-bond interactions from O3 to Asp295 OD2 and from O1 to Ala332 O. The O2 atom is hydrogen bonded to Wat126 and Wat802. The ®nal model had an Rfree of 18.8% and an Rwork of 16.4%. Given the crystallization conditions, the only signi®cant anomalous scattering signal was expected to come from either

S atoms [f HH (S) = 0.558 e] in Cys and Met residues and perhaps from solvent sulfate ions, from potassium cations [f HH (K) = 1.07 e] or from I atoms [f HH (I) = 6.843 e]. It was therefore relatively straightforward to identify I atoms owing to their large f HH value. In total, 29 I atoms were found as two clusters of ®ve atoms each, one four-atom cluster, one three-atom cluster, two pairs of atoms (probably mutually exclusive) and eight single sites. The occupancies of the iodine sites ranged from 0.61 to 0.21. The average B factor for the 29 I atoms was Ê 29 A2. Analysis of the autoSHARP heavy-atom positions compared with the re®ned positions of anomalous scattering centres showed that 31 sites agreed with an r.m.s. deviation of Ê 0.37 A. The positions corresponded to 24 I atoms, ®ve S atoms in Met and Cys residues and two active-site Ca2+ ions.

The starting model for the analysis was the re®ned native structure of the antibody fragment (Leo James, personal

communication). A total of 13 iodine sites were identi®ed using ADF maps calculated with model phases. The ®nal model had an Rfree of 22.8% and an Rwork of 18.5%. The Ramachandran plot showed one residue, ThrL53, in the disallowed region. However on inspection, the residue was modelled in very clear electron density but was positioned at the end of a tight turn in the main chain. Iodine was bound as two triiodide ions and seven single iodide ions. The triiodides lie very close to one another and are bound through hydrophobic interactions with GluL40, LysL41, HisL44, ProL42, GluL85, AlaL86, IleL87 and LysL105 from the light chain and ProH75 from the heavy chain. Both triiodides are unsymmetrical and deviate from a linear arrangement (see Table 7). The iodine occupancies Ê range from 0.23 to 0.41 and the average B factor is 32.2 A2. Analysis of the autoSHARP heavy-atom positions showed that all of the 13 re®ned iodine sites had been found as well as all seven S atoms in Met and Cys residues. The r.m.s. deviation between the autoSHARP and BUSTER/TNT re®ned positions Ê was 0.26 A.
6.3. HEWL KI/I2

After the addition of 99 waters to the starting model (Evans et al., 2002), ®ve iodine sites were identi®ed. Sites B11 and B12 are the central and outer I atoms of an IÀ ion which sits across 3 a special position such that the outer atoms of the triiodide are related by symmetry. The central atom, B11, has fractional coordinates À0.201, 0.201, 0.250 and has a re®ned occupancy of 0.23 which, because of its twofold nature, corresponds to a physical occupancy of 0.46 shared between two HEWL molecules. The triiodide sits between two molecules, making contacts to the hydrophobic parts of Lys13 and Arg14 and to the backbone carboxyl group of Ala10 and Leu129. The third iodine site, B21, is identical to a known chlorine-binding site in HEWL. It was identi®ed as iodine on the basis of its re®ned occupancy and of the height of its ADF peak relative to other S and Cl atoms. Sites B31 and B41 are also single iodide sites but have low occupancies of $0.20. The ®nal model incorporating three ethylene glycol molecules, seven Cl atoms and three Na atoms had a Rfree of 20.8% and an Rwork of 17.2%.
6.4. PPE KI/I2

Figure 2

Region of the elastase molecule showing the common binding site for (a) iodine and (b) xenon.

A re®ned model of PPE retrieved from the PDB (code Â 1c1m; Prange et al., 1998) was used as a starting model for re®nement against the KI/I2-soaked PPE data. The ®nal model had an Rfree of 20.5% and an Rwork of 16.9%. A total of four triiodide molecules were identi®ed in the structure, along with three more sites where pairs of I atoms were found together as indicated by a very weak signal in the anomalous difference Fourier map. One pair of iodine positions was found close to and roughly collinear with the position of a bound sulfate ion from the native structure. The ADF peak height at the sulfate position was roughly twice that of other cysteinyl S atoms in the structure and its re®ned B factor was approximately double. It was likely therefore that an I atom occupied the position of the `native' sulfate ion. The triiodide molecule with the highest re®ned occupancy was in the catalytic site of the proteinase. In fact, four distinct peaks were observed (B11±B14) with re®ned occupancies of Ê 0.87, 0.84, 0.50 and 0.60. Site B11 was only 0.83 A away from the Xe site in PPE identi®ed by Schiltz et al. (1995). Fig. 2 shows the PPE catalytic site with Xe and triiodide bound. The sum of the occupancies of B13 and B14 is higher than the individual occupancies of B11 and B22, which suggests that these two atoms are both present together in the structure; thus, the four-atom cluster does not represent two conformations of a triiodide molecule. Retrospective analysis of the autoSHARP heavy-atom positions for PPE showed that only seven of the 23 ®nal

re®ned iodine sites had been used in the phase determination. Ê Their positions agreed with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.56 A. The relatively low number of heavy-atom positions found by autoSHARP re¯ects the on average lower quality of the PPE native and derivative data sets, as indicated by their merging statistics in Table 4. This may also explain the dependence of the phase determination on the isomorphous signal derived from inclusion of the native data. and this could be responsible for the higher resolution diffraction. Site B21 is hydrogen bonded to Leu93 N in a small pocket on the outer surface of the spherical shell of the apoferritin molecule. B31 also sits on a twofold axis between two molecular subunits and interacts with Leu81 and two symmetryÊ related I atoms B32 which are 3.07 A away. The B32±B31±B32 Ê triplet represent a triiodide molecule. B41 is 8.25 A away from 2+ the second Cd site (B102) near the outer entrance to the Ê narrow threefold channel. The site is 4.88 A from the threefold axis. Finally, a group of four weak iodine sites B51±B54 were observed in a hydrophobic pocket on the inner surface of the apoferritin spherical shell.

6.5. APO KI/I2

Model re®nement against the APO-KI/I2 data led to the identi®cation of nine bound I atoms and produced a ®nal Rfree of 20.5% and Rwork of 18.0%. Iodine site B11 is bound with an occupancy factor of 0.64 to the ®rst Cd2+ ion (B101), which is responsible for stabilizing the intermolecular crystal contacts through Asp80. In fact, two symmetry-related iodines bind a single Cd2 ion forming coordination bonds. The bond length Ê Ê of 2.79 A is in excellent agreement to within Æ0.005 A with the average CdÐI distance calculated from a variety of structures containing CdÐI bonds (Svensson et al., 1998), whereas the bond angle of 95.05 is at the lower end of the range of observed IÐCdÐI bond angles (95.44±121.82 ). The coordination of the Cd atom by two Asp80 side chains and two B11 I atoms is approximately tetrahedral. The iodine binding did not hinder the ability of Cd atom to stabilize the crystal contacts and in fact appeared to have a positive effect on the crystal stability as witnessed by an increase in the maximum Ê resolution obtained with KI/I2-soaked crystals (2.01 A) Ê ). A reduction compared with that for the native crystals (2.6 A Ê in the unit-cell parameters of 0.56 A (0.31%) on addition of KI/I2 suggests that the molecules pack together more tightly

7. Discussion
7.1. Combinatorial counter-ion replacement

The bene®ts of using combinations of counter-ions in phasing HEWL as opposed to using conventional SIRAS were investigated by examining quantitative measures of phasing power which are presented in Fig. 3. Heavy-atom re®nement and phase calculation were performed for the conventional SIRAS approach using four pairs of HEWL data sets: NaCl±NaI, NaCl±CsCl, NaCl±CsI and CsCl±CsI. These SIRAS results were compared with those obtained using all four data sets simultaneously in a combinatorial phasing experiment. The best SIRAS phases are produced by NaCl±NaI (PCC = 0.676) where only iodine provides isomorphous signal. The results from the NaCl±CsI pair (PCC = 0.657) are similar and suggest that the Cs atoms contribute little to the phasing. Indeed, the NaCl±CsCl pair, where isomorphous differences arise from Cs alone, provides the least phase information (PCC = 0.536). Phasing from CsCl±CsI, where again iodine is expected to contribute most to isomorphous differences, gives a PCC of 0.605. Although the iodine is clearly the main source of phase information, a signi®cant gain in the quality of the phases is observed when all four data sets are combined for heavy-atom re®nement and phasing. The average PCC for experimental phases increases from 0.676 (the best SIRAS result) to 0.796 when the full combinatorial design is used. The improvement is more marked as a function of resolution (see Fig. 3). Beyond Ê Ê 2.5 A (0.4 AÀ1), the increase in PCC for the combinatorial case over individual SIRAS results is between 0.1 and 0.3. The combined use of a few counter-ions species compared with a single species offers the bene®ts of improved phasing power and potentially better experimental phases to pass on to density-modi®cation schemes.

Ê where an average bond length of 2.915 A was observed (Sakane et al., 2001). Our results show that I atoms bind predominantly to hydrophobic pockets as triiodide molecules or by hydrogenbonding interactions with main-chain and side-chain atoms. Table 8 lists the polyiodide- and iodide-binding sites for the ®ve structures and classi®es their interaction with the macromolecule as hydrophobic and/or hydrogen bonding at surface pockets (intermolecular pockets if formed by one or more molecules) and in inter- or intramolecular cavities. Hydrophobic binding is generally observed for polyiodide molecules and is characterized by van der Waals interactions Ê at distances greater than 3.8 A on average with mostly C atoms of the main chain, side-chain C atoms and less often with main-chain carbonyl groups. In some cases, apparent water±iodine interactions are visible but dif®cult to interpret because the iodine sites are only partially occupied. Thus, water molecules that, by virtue of their proximity, could form electrostatic interactions with iodine may themselves exclude the presence of iodine. Without higher resolution data allowing a better determination of the occupancies of water molecules and better interpretation of the partially occupied iodine/water sites, it is dif®cult to identify conclusively the extent of water±iodine interactions except for a few cases where the local order of the molecules allows a clear interpretation. Iodide ions interact predominantly through hydrogen bonds with the main-chain amide groups of Trp, Tyr, Phe, Leu, Gly, Arg and Asn residues. Hydrogen-bond interactions are also formed with side-chain N atoms of Gln, Lys, Arg and Asn, the hydroxyl groups of Ser and in a single case (ABF) through the N atom of the indole ring of Trp. Fig. 4 shows two examples of hydrogen bonding on the surface of ABF from iodine B71 to TrpH100 NE1 and from B91 to PheH105 N. These sites were both one quarter occupied. Hydrogen-bond formation between amide groups and halide ions is commonly observed and exploited in supramolecular chemistry (Schneider & Yatsimirsky, 2000). Iodide ions also bind through hydrophobic interactions as observed by Dauter et al. (2000), but this occurs much less frequently in the ®ve structures discussed here. The binding properties of polyiodides are sometimes a mixture of van der Waals and hydrogen bonding. This can be seen from Fig. 5, which shows a triiodide binding at the surface of PPE through a combination of van der Waals interactions with protein atoms at one end and electrostatic interactions with an ordered water molecule at the other. A further example is shown in Fig. 6, where a pentaiodide molecule is bound between two symmetry-related molecules in XI. The pentaiodide interacts through van der Waals forces along its length, but is anchored by hydrogen bonds from each of its end atoms to amide groups of Gln234 and Lys240. This would suggest that the majority of the charge on the pentaiodide molecule resides at its ends. Ab initio calculations on the triiodide ion indicate a charge distribution in solution of just less than À0.5 e on each end atom (Lynden-Bell et al., 1998). Hydrogen-bond formation by the end I atoms would indicate that in our case the charge is qualitatively distributed in a similar manner along the pentaiodide molecule. The PPE structure illustrates triiodide's ability to bind at hydrophobic sites. In this case, it binds in the same position that both Xe and Kr occupied in previous work on PPE (Schiltz et al., 1995, 1997). Xe bound to PPE, obtained using a pressure of 1.5 MPa, had a re®ned occupancy of 0.78 and a B Ê factor of 15.5 A2. Using a pressure of 5.6 MPa, Kr was found Ê to bind with occupancy 0.5 and B factor 18.9 A2. The main iodine-binding site in PPE determined here has a ®nal re®ned Ê occupancy of 0.87 and a B factor of 16.9 A2. The observation

that I and Xe may bind at the same position in PPE agrees with that of Schoenborn et al. (1965) for myoglobin. Â In work performed by Prange et al. (1998) on the binding of Xe to HEWL (PDB code 1c10), three Xe-binding sites were observed, none of which is in common with iodide- or triiodide-binding sites in HEWL-KI/I2. At Xe site 1 in 1c10, a Wat60 is seen in HEWL-KI/I2. At site 2, a small intermolecular cavity, no atom is observed in HEWL-KI/I2 and at site 3 an ethylene glycol molecule Etg131 is seen. The absence of any triiodide binding in HEWL-KI/I2 at site 2 is a consquence of the small size of the intermolecular cavity. IÀ would be small enough to gain access to this site, but this is energetically unfavourable. The HEWL Xe work was carried out at room temperature and therefore in the absence of cryoprotectant. It is interesting to note that Xe and ethylene glycol share a binding site in HEWL. This site is spacious enough to host a triiodide molecule; however, in HEWL-KI/I2 binding of ethylene glycol is favoured. This may suggest some competition between ethylene glycol and triiodide for hydrophobic binding sites and might explain the low number of triiodide-binding sites in the HEWL and APO structures, since these were the only two structures where ethylene glycol was used as a cryoprotectant. The other cryoprotectants used, l-xylose and glycerol, would tend to interact through hydrogen bonding and would therefore be less likely to inhibit the binding of triiodide. In retrospect, the most striking result of the study is the apparent promiscuity of triiodide and its ability to form larger polyiodide chains on encountering a protein molecule. This ability to bind so readily to proteins is a consequence of its physical characteristics. Firstly, the ¯exibility of polyiodides both in terms of variation in bond length and bond angle enable them to yield to the numerous potential binding motifs at the surface of proteins. Secondly, iodine's high polarizability enables it to form stable bonds involving electrostatic interactions via dipole and charge-induced dipole moments and through London interactions (Schoenborn et al., 1965). Finally, the low average charge per atom in polyiodide chains gives the molecule access to hydrophobic regions of protein molecules. An added bonus comes from the fact that where triiodide binding is not favoured either because of its size or its preference for oily surfaces, the iodide ions alone may be able to form ordered sites through electrostatic interactions.

The HEWL and APO cases were less promising that ABF, XI and PPE in terms of phasing using the triiodide derivatives.

It may well be that in some cases the binding of counter-ions and/or triiodide ions will be too weak to support ab initio heavy-atom detection and de novo phasing. If an initial model for the protein is available, however, it may allow detection to take place and the phase information thus generated may be of value in helping overcome model bias from the initial model during the re®nement of the structure. This could be especially useful in ligand-binding studies.

The anomalous signal present in the data suggested signi®cant iodine binding and the structure re®nement con®rmed this by identifying triiodide/iodide sites. The failure of the phasing in both cases arose from the unfortunate positioning of major iodine sites (and in the APO case the Cd2+ ion) on special positions in the unit cell. This complicated both the heavyatom determination and the phasing steps. The APO case was extreme in that all of the stronger heavy-atom sites lay on or very near special positions, giving rise to systematic absences of phase information in reciprocal space and hence aliasing of electron-density maps. The success and quality of the phase determination for ABF, XI and PPE shows that the concentration of iodine binding achieved with cryosoaks of a few minutes is certainly suf®cient for the structure solution of macromolecular crystal structures with up to 40 kDa per asymmetric unit. Table 9 shows the unit-cell parameters of native and KI/I2soaked crystals for all ®ve cases and the differences arising from soaking. On average, the change in unit-cell length was Ê Ê 0.165 A, with a maximum change of 0.42 A occurring along the a axis of PPE. On a residue-by-residue basis in the re®ned structures, local r.m.s. deviations from the native structures of Ê È up to a few angstroms were observed predominantly in the vicinity of iodine binding. The largest changes occurred in the vicinity of triiodide binding. The usefulness of native plus derivative data for phasing should therefore not be greatly restricted by non-isomorphism effects. Indeed, for PPE, where the largest cell-edge changes were observed, the use of native diffraction data to provide isomorphous signal was essential for the determination of suf®ciently good phases to allow automatic model building. The use of triiodide as a `heavy-molecule' derivative provides the added advantage that the results of heavy-atom structure determination can, in the ®rst place, be assessed on the basis of whether some sites lie within expected IÐI distances of each other and, in the future, be performed using the triiodide molecule as a search model. During these studies, the identi®cation of groups of three atoms approximately Ê 2.7 A apart played a signi®cant role in increasing our level of con®dence in the the heavy-atom solutions generated by RANTAN and in the positions of extra sites determined with the help of SHARP residual maps.

The studies performed here demonstrate triiodide's ability to bind at pHs ranging from 4.7 to 7.5 and, together with the triiodide-binding studies of Fukuyama et al. (1995) on peroxidase performed at pH 6.5 and 5.0, suggest that the triiodide ion is stable over this range and able to bind to macromolecules. Ammonium sulfate and sodium chloride are two of the most commonly used crystallization reagents for macromolecules (Gilliland et al., 1994). It is therefore our belief that triiodide derivatization should be applicable in a large number of cases. The relationship between the number of bound iodine sites and the molecular weight of the ®ve test proteins was well described by a straight line, suggesting that the larger the protein, the greater the level of binding one could expect from triiodide and iodide. Similar observations have been made in short halide-soak investigations (Dauter et al., 2000). This bodes well for the determination of much larger structures using KI/I2 as a derivatizing agent.

8. Conclusions
We have shown that KI/I2 solutions can be successfully used with short-soak methods to generate derivatives with heavyatom sites of varying structural character which allow phase determination by the SAD and SIRAS methods using conventional Cu K radiation. The nature of the bound polyiodide molecules makes them easily identi®able at the heavy-atom detection stage. The strong colouration seen in KI/I2 derivative crystals also provides valuable assurance that binding has occurred. We have also demonstrated that improvements in the quality of experimental phases from in-house X-ray apparatus may be achieved by systematic variation of the heavy-atom substructure using combinatorial counter-ion replacement. Thus, at ®xed wavelengths one can produce systematic variations in the scattering power generated at particular binding sites through chemical means. Both these techniques should be useful sources of inexpensive phase information, either for de novo structure determination or for bias removal in structures from homologous starting models. The triiodide work could be extended through the use of synchrotron radiation, which would allow selection of longer wavelengths to further enhance the anomalous signal of iodine. Recent studies by Weiss et al. (2001) have shown that Ê routine diffraction measurement at wavelengths of 2.6 A are indeed a reality on suitably designed and equipped beamlines.

Similarly, combinatorial counter-ion replacement can take advantage of other counter-ion species such as Rb+ (Korolev et al., 2001) and BrÀ and could therefore be used to enhance the quality of phasing from ®xed-wavelength synchrotron beamline side-stations tuned to shorter wavelengths. It still remains to be seen whether triiodide is of use with other crystallization reagents. Recent observations suggest that its use in combination with PEG may be hindered by PEG's af®nity for binding iodine. However, we believe that the large ¯exibility in iodine's chemistry may provide numerous ways of mediating its incorporation into PEGgrown protein crystals. This will be the subject of further investigation.
