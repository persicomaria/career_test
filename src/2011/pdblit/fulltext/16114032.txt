Introduction. Purine breakdown occurs through inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine as intermediates, culminating in the formation of uric acid as the final, secreted product in higher mammals. In other organisms, uric acid is oxidized by urate oxidase to a short-lived 5-hydroxyisourate that is enzymatically converted to allantoin,1 which in lower mammals is a urinary excretion product. In plants and bacteria, allantoin, having a high nitrogen to carbon ratio, is the key intermediate in nitrogen fixation. Allantoin degradation occurs via several routes and results in glyoxylate and either urea2 or ammonia and CO2.3,4 Allantoin has many applications and in particular is used as an abrasive and astringent agent in cosmetic lotions, creams, suntan products, scalp preparations, shampoos, lipsticks, and various aerosol preparations.5,6 It is also used in topical pharmaceutical preparations.7 Bacteria such as Escherichia coli can utilize allantoin as a sole source of nitrogen but not as a sole source of carbon. The breakdown of allantoin occurs under anaerobic conditions. It is first converted to allantoate by allantoinase [AllB; Enzyme Commission (EC) 3.5.2.5], followed by conversion to (S)-ureidoglycolate and urea, the reaction catalyzed by allantoate amidohydrolase (AllC; EC 3.5.3.4). The third step of this pathway consists of hydrolysis of (S)-ureidoglycolate by ureidoglycolate hydrolase (AllA; EC 3.5.3.19) to yield glyoxylate, ammonia and CO2.4 Alternatively, (S)-ureidoglycolate can be converted to oxalureate by ureidoglycolate dehydrogenase (AllD; EC 1.1.1.154), leading in turn to the formation of carbamoyl phosphate. Other bacteria, such as Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, and Burkholderia convert (S)-ureidoglycolate to glyoxylate and urea by ureidoglycolate lyase (EC 4.3.2.3). The ureidoglycolate lyase from Burkholderia cepacia has been the most extensively characterized at the biochemical level.8 In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the conversion of allantoin is catalyzed not by an AllC orthologue but by a different enzyme, allantoate amidinohydrolase (allantoicase, DAL2).9 The E. coli genes associated with allantoin degradation are organized into a regulon consisting of 3 contiguous transcriptional units under the control of the same repressor and encoding 13 different proteins.4,10 In addition to

enzymes with assigned functions, this regulon also contains putative allantoin and purine permeases and at least 2 proteins with unknown/unconfirmed functions. Crystal structures are known for some members of the allantoin degradation pathway, including for DAL2 from S. cerevisiae11,12 and AllD from E. coli [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code: 1XRH; Rajashankar et al.13]. The structure of AllB is expected to be similar to that of L-hydantoinase (EC 3.5.2.2) from Arthrobacter aurescens (PDB code: 1GKR14), with which it shares 37% sequence identity. In addition, the structure of YlbA (PDB code: 1RC6), a protein with as yet an unknown function, has also been recently determined. AllA (formerly YbbT) belongs to the ureidoglycolate hydrolase family (PF04115, PFAM15), and includes 30 sequences from protobacteria (24 sequences) including E. coli, yeast, and fungi (7 sequences). The main difference between the bacterial and fungal sequences is an insertion of 15 residues in fungal proteins between residues 65 and 66 of E. coli AllA. The reaction catalyzed by AllA is shown in Scheme 1. Here we report the crystal structure determination of ureidoglycolate hydrolase (EC 3.5.3.19) from the enterohemorrhagic strain of E. coli at 1.7 Å resolution. Materials and Methods. The allA (previously ybbT) gene was amplified from E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 genomic DNA and cloned into a modified pET20b vector for expression as a noncleavable C-terminal His6 tagged fusion protein. For selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled protein production, E. coli DL4116 was transformed with plasmid

DNA and protein expression induced by adding 100 M isopropylthio- -D-galactoside (IPTG) for 20 h at 22°C. Protein was purified by affinity chromatography using NiNTA (Qiagen). Approximately 20 mg of purified protein was obtained from 0.5 L of culture. Purified AllA protein was homogeneous by both sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The purified protein was concentrated to 7 mg/mL in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 M NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM diothreitol (DTT), and 5 mM glyoxylate, and used for screening of crystallization conditions in sitting drops. Initial crystals were obtained from several conditions in Hampton Screens I and II (Hampton Research, CA). The best crystals grew from drops containing 0.5 L of the protein and 0.8 L of reservoir solution containing 22.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG3350), 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 5.9, 0.2 M NH4Cl, and 40 mM malonate equilibrated against 100 L of reservoir solution. These crystals belong to space group P21, with a 43.0, b 74.5, c 56.3Å, 103.9°, and Z 4. Prior to X-ray data collection, crystals were transferred to a drop of reservoir solution, picked up in a nylon loop and flashcooled in a N2 cold stream at 100 K. A 3-wavelength multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) experiment was performed at beamline X8C, National Synchroton Light Source (NSLS), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), and diffraction data recorded on a Quantum-4 charge-coupled device (CCD) area detector (Area Detector Systems Corporation, CA). Data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000.17 Initial phases were obtained by using the program SOLVE.18 These phases were improved by density modification with the program RESOLVE,19 which was able to automatically build 251 out a total of 320 residues in 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. The remaining residues were manually fitted into the electron density map using XtalView.20 Refinement was performed against the diffraction data collected at the Se high remote energy, as this was the first data set collected and showed the highest resolution (1.7 Å). The program REFMAC521 was used for refinement and was interspersed with cycles of manual refitting. Translation/libration/screw-rotation (TLS) refinement within REFMAC21 was used to model temperature factors, and the refinement converged with Rwork 0.226 and Rfree 0.269 for all measured reflections. The final model consists of 2 chains with 160 residues each, 319 water molecules, and 1 glyoxylate molecule. A short segment of a surface exposed loop, residues 143­146, had disordered side-chains, and only the backbone atoms were modeled for these residues. Similarly, the side-chain of Arg132 was not visible in the electron

density and was not modeled. Analysis of the structure with the program PROCHECK22 showed good geometry, with only one outlier in the Ramachandran plot. The backbone of Gln131 in both molecules is in a disallowed region ( / : / ). This residue is at the corner of a turn at the surface and has very well-defined electron density. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The coordinates of AllA have been deposited in the PDB with the code 1YQC. Results and Discussion. Overall fold: Each AllA monomer consists of a globular domain made up almost entirely of -strands. The strands are arranged in 3 layers [Fig. 1(a)]. The first layer is a 5-stranded antiparallel -sheet made of strands of varying length; the middle layer contains 3 antiparallel -strands; and the third layer contains 3 long and curved mixed -strands. At their ends, the strands from the third layer add to the middle -sheet, extending it somewhat. Residues Glu21­Leu41 form a -hairpin that extends away from the globular domain. The molecules associate into dimers through face-to-face interactions of their 5-stranded -sheets. The hairpins extending from each monomer contact the other partner in the dimer and form a continuous extension of the contact

sheet into a 7-stranded antiparallel -sheet [Fig. 1(b)]. These two -hairpins constitute an excellent example of domain swapping to form the AllA dimer.23 Residues from the 2 -sheets that form the dimer interface are predominantly hydrophobic and include many leucines and isoleucines. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds that are formed are mostly between the main-chain atoms contributing to the formation

of secondary structures. One intermolecular salt bridge is formed at the edge of the contacting surfaces, between Arg37 from one monomer and Asp140 from the other. The burried area upon dimer formation is extensive, with 2120 Å2 of each monomer involved in intermolecular contacts, corresponding to 23% of the total solvent-accessible area of the monomer. Comparison with other structures: Although the amino

acid sequence of AllA shows no significant homology to proteins with known 3-dimensional (3D) structure, the polypeptide fold found in this enzyme has been observed in other proteins and is referred to as the cupin fold (SCOP24). Proteins belonging to this superfamily cover a wide range of biochemical functions and structures, and include enzymes, storage proteins, and transcription factors,25 with many of them containing metal-binding sites. A search for proteins having related structures using DALI26 showed that the closest structural neighbor is oxalate decarboxylase from Bacillus subtilis (PDB code: 1J5827 or 1UW828) with a Z score of 5.4 and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 3.9 Å for 120 C atoms out of 160. Optimization of this superposition overlaps 64 C atoms of the first and second -sheet with an RMSD of 1.5 Å. The similarity to oxalate decarboxylase is, however, more intriguing. This enzyme of 377 residues utilizes a Mn2 ion for its catalytic activity and possesses an internal pseudo 2-fold symmetry, indicating an ancient gene duplication event.27,29 This is strongly corroborated by the structure of the AllA dimer, where the arrangement of the 2 monomers within the dimer is very similar to the arrangement of the 2 halves of oxalate decarboxylase [Fig. 1(c)]. Moreover, the polypeptide segments (residues 21­ 41) that extend from the main body of each AllA monomer and cross over to the opposite monomers [Fig. 1(a and b)] have their structural counterparts in oxalate decarboxylase but in the opposite half-unit [Fig. 1(c)], further supporting the above-mentioned notion of domain swapping in AllA. Putative active site: Alignment of 40 protein sequences showing 25­95% sequence identity to AllA and identified by PSI-BLAST30 highlighted invariant and

highly conserved residues. Conserved hydrophobic residues line the -strands of the first 2 -sheets that face one another within the protein core. The second group of conserved residues consists of hydrophilic residues and includes Glu72, His74, Gln79, and His124, which cluster together at the bottom of a deep depression in the monomer surface and are partially exposed to the solvent. This later cluster of conserved residues most likely defines the catalytic center of the molecule. This hypothesis is supported by the superposition of AllA with oxalate decarboxylase, which shows that this cluster of conserved hydrophilic residues superimposes on the manganese-binding residues of oxalate decarboxylase [Fig. 2(a)]. What is more, we have identified a glyoxylate molecule in the electron density map near this cluster. We have further compared AllA with another member of the cupin superfamily, Aspergillus japonicus quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase (PDB code: 1GQG31), which contains a bound inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate coordinating the metal [Fig. 2(b)]. Again, the 4 conserved hydrophilic residues of AllA superimpose on the copper-coordinating side-chains, and the location of glyoxylate is very similar to that of the inhibitor in quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase. Although we have found no bound metal ion at this site, the conservation of Glu72, His74, Gln79, and His124 in all ureidoglycolate hydrolase sequences strongly suggests that the role of these side-chains is to coordinate a metal ion, which is further involved in substrate binding. While the active site is formed by residues from 1 monomer only, the extended loop from the second monomer of the dimer partially covers the substrate binding site and converts it into a
