type mice. Since expression of Mmp8 is most apparent after the marrow cavity is formed, Mmp8 could have a more profound role in adult skeletal remodeling than in endochondral bone formation during embryonic development.

Department of Pharmacology and Interdepartmental Program in Vascular Biology and Transplantation, Yale University School of Medicine, CT 06520, USA The activation of integrin adhesion receptors from low to high affinity in response to intracellular cues controls cell adhesion, migration and signaling. Binding of the cytoskeletal protein talin via its PTB-like domain to the 3 integrin cytoplasmic tail is necessary and sufficient for 3 activation. The talin-binding motif is conserved between integrin  tails, talin binds most integrin  subunits, and talin is required for 1 integrin activation. It has therefore been assumed that talin activates 1 and 3 integrins in a similar fashion. Here we report that, while the conserved talin PTB domain-integrin interaction is required for 1 activation, over-expressed integrin-binding fragments of talin do not activate 1 integrins. Furthermore, while over-expressed free 1 tails trans-dominantly inhibit 3 integrins by sequestering talin, free 1 tails defective in talin-binding can still suppress 1 integrin activation. These data point to an additional 1-binding factor that cooperates with talin during 1 activation. Mutagenesis of the 1 tail has identified residues that lie outside the talinbinding site which are required for 1 activation, and are likely to be involved in the binding of this second 1-specific activating factor. Free 1 tails mutated at this site and also defective in talin binding are unable to trans-dominantly suppress 1 integrin activation. We propose that the requirement for a second 1-specific activating factor provides a mechanism to selectively regulate 1 integrins.

Sdc1 inhibits tumor invasion by blocking 31 integrin signaling Y. Ji, A.C. Rapraeger Department of Pathology, University of Wisconsin-Madison In the present study, Sdc1 is found to block tumor cell invasion through inhibition of signaling downstream of the 31 integrin. Over-expression of Sdc1 in highly invasive MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells (mS1-MB-231) cultured in matrigel dramatically decreases the cell invasion. The cells become cohesive and polarized, demonstrated by the polarized distribution of the 6 integrin subunit or -catenin. Further studies show that Sdc1 restores cohesion by suppressing 31 integrin signaling. Blockade of 3 or 1 but neither 2 nor 6 integrin activity in MDA-MB-231 cells cultured in matrigel mimics the cohesive phenotype observed in the mS1-MB-231 cells, while enhancing activation of the  1 integrin in mS1-MB-231 cells reverts the cohesive cells back to the invasive phenotype. Activation of Rac-1 is inhibited by Sdc-1. Blockade of 31 also downregulates Rac-1 activity, while the activation of 1 integrin abolishes the down-regulation of Rac-1 by Sdc1, suggesting that Sdc1 crosstalks with 31 integrin through Rac-1. Inhibition of Rac-1 activity is required but not sufficient for reversion of the invasive phenotype of MDAMB-231 cells. DN Rac-1 fails to restore the cohesion phenotype whereas CA Rac-1 mutant disrupts it. Active PI3K is also required for the Sdc1 cohesion activity because blockade of PI3K by LY294002 disrupts Sdc1 cohesion activity. Staining of Sdc1 and PI3K in the mS1-MB-231 cells cultured in matrigel shows that both proteins are highly enriched at the lateral surface. Moreover, GST-S1CD but not GST alone binds the p85 subunit of PI3K in MDA-MB-231 cell lysates.

Hyposialylation of 1 integrins activates 41 receptors A.V. Woodard-Grice, A.C. McBrayer, S.L. Bellis University of Alabama at Birmingham During inflammation, monocytes become activated and simultaneously begin differentiating along the macrophage lineage. These events are accompanied by the activation of multiple integrin receptors. The 41 integrin binds to VCAM-1 on the endothelium, thereby facilitating monocyte extravasation. We hypothesize that 41 activation is due, at least in part, to the synthesis of a 1 integrin species that lacks 2-6-linked sialic acid, a negatively-charged sugar added by the ST6Gal I sialyltransferase. During the in vitro differentiation of monocytes into macrophages (induced by phorbol esters), ST6Gal I expression is downregulated, which, in turn, causes 1 integrin hyposialylation. The expression of hyposialylated integrins is temporally correlated with increased cell adhesion to VCAM-1. In addition, ST6Gal I downregulation, integrin hyposialylation, and VCAM-1 binding are all directed by a
