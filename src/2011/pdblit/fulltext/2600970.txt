Crystal Structure of an IHF-DNA Complex: A Protein-Induced DNA U-Turn

Nash  *Laboratory of Molecular Biology National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases  Laboratory of Molecular Biology National Institute of Mental Health National Institutes of Health Bethesda, Maryland 20892 absence of DNA, has been solved by both X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (Tanaka et al. 1984; White et al, 1989; Vis et al. 1995). The two subunits are intertwined to form a compact "body," from which two long ribbon "arms" extend. The geometry and electrostatics of the HU arms, combined with DNAfootprinting data for IHF, suggested that the arms would wrap around the minor groove of the DNA (White et al., 1989; Yang and Nash, 1989). Although IHF protects >25 bp, only 9, found in two patches on the right side of the binding site, show significant sequence conservation (Figure 1A) (Goodrich et al., 1990). Even these nine are rather variable: only two are conserved in all known IHF binding sites. Nevertheless, the sequence specificity of IHF is substantial: some sites are preferred over random sequences by a factor of 103­10 4 (Mengeritsky et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1995; Yang and Nash, 1995). Many IHF binding sites include an A tract in the left half, and addition of an A tract to a site that does not naturally have one enhances binding (Hales et al. 1994a, 1996). Most chemical protection and interference studies suggest that IHF recognizes its binding site through contacts confined to the minor groove of DNA (Yang and Nash, 1989; Wang et al. 1995) despite the relative lack of distinguishing characteristics on this surface. Thus, IHF is a protein whose interaction with DNA presents many unique and challenging features. We report here the structure of the E. coli IHF heterodimer bound to 35 bp of DNA. The DNA is wrapped around the protein, essentially reversing the direction of the helix axis. Our results also show that IHF is a member of a growing class of minor groove­intercalating DNAbending proteins, and that it relies heavily on "indirect readout" to recognize its binding site. Results Structure Determination IHF was cocrystallized with a 35 bp DNA fragment containing the H site of phage , one of the best characterized and tightest IHF binding sites (Yang and Nash, 1995). The DNA used for the initial structure determination (H 2N) was constructed from four separate oligonucleotides, with an 8 bp overlap in the center (Figure 1A). Gel-shift analysis was used to select positions for the nicks that did not interfere with IHF binding (data not shown). Isomorphous crystals were later grown using site H 1N, in which only the top strand was nicked. The diffraction from both types of crystals is quite aniso° tropic, extending beyond 2.2 A in one direction but only ° to 3 A in another. The structure was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (MIRAS) and cross-crystal averaging (Table 1, Figure 1B). The model was refined initially against data collected from a crystal grown with site H 2N and subsequently H 1N. The final model has an R factor of 19.2%, with good stereochemistry. Of the nonglycine residues, 95% lie in

Summary Integration host factor (IHF) is a small heterodimeric protein that specifically binds to DNA and functions as an architectural factor in many cellular processes in prokaryotes. Here, we report the crystal structure of IHF complexed with 35 bp of DNA. The DNA is wrapped around the protein and bent by >160 , thus reversing the direction of the helix axis within a very short distance. Much of the bending occurs at two large kinks where the base stacking is interrupted by intercalation of a proline residue. IHF contacts the DNA exclusively via the phosphodiester backbone and the minor groove and relies heavily on indirect readout to recognize its binding sequence. One such readout involves a six-base A tract, providing evidence for the importance of a narrow minor groove. Introduction For macromolecular complexes built on a DNA template, the active components are often insufficient to generate the proper architecture, and accessory factors are needed. IHF, a small, sequence-specific DNA binding protein, is one such accessory found in E. coli and related bacteria. Although first discovered as a host factor for bacteriophage integration, IHF assists in many processes that involve higher order protein­DNA complexes: e.g., in replication, where it binds to oriC; in transcriptional regulation, where it binds upstream of many 54 -dependent promoters; and in a variety of sitespecific recombination systems (for reviews, see Nash, 1996; Goosen and van de Putte, 1995). IHF's primary function appears to be architectural, i.e., introducing a sharp bend in the DNA that facilitates the interaction of other components in a nucleoprotein array. Where tested, IHF can be at least partially replaced by heterologous DNA-bending proteins or by intrinsically bent DNA (Goodman et al., 1992; Molina-Lopez et al., 1994; Perez Martin et al., 1994; Segall et al., 1994; Parekh and Hatfield, 1996). The protein is a heterodimer of two 10 kDa subunits that are 30% identical in sequence. Both subunits are also closely related to HU, a nonspecific DNA binding protein that also bends DNA. Members of this family have been found in a broad range of prokaryotes (Oberto and Rouviere-Yaniv, 1996). The structure of the homodimeric HU protein from B. stearothermophilus, in the

The consensus sequence for IHF binding (Goodrich et al., 1990) is in bold. Asterisks mark bases that were replaced by 5-iodo-deoxyuracil to supply heavy atom derivatives. Each strand was synthesized either as two separate oligonucleotides, resulting in the nicks marked by arrows, or as a single 35-mer.

the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot as defined by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), and none lie in the disallowed regions. The two nicks in site H 2N are each at or adjacent to a large kink in DNA. At the bottom strand (right side) nick, the flanking nucleotides have rotated so as to bring the minor groove width closer to that of B form DNA than would be possible in continuous DNA (data not shown). However, the differences between the structures with sites H 2N and H 1N are minor and restricted to the immediate vicinity of this nick. This indicates that the overall shape of the DNA and its deformation by kinking are not artifacts of the nicks. The top strand nick (in both sites) is involved in crystal packing and leads to an unusual structure. To move the phosphate backbone out of the way of the neighboring complex, the bp 5 to the nick adopts a Hoogsteen configuration, and the one before that forms a reverse Watson­Crick pair. However, the overall kink in this region is similar to the kink on the other side of the complex, and we presume that, as above, the structure of the DNA is only locally influenced by the nick. This assumption is supported by the pseudosymmetry of the

backbone protection pattern for the H site, which suggests that the two kinks have a similar shape (Yang and Nash, 1989). However, a definitive test of this assumption will be difficult since the remaining nick is involved in crystal packing, thus preventing formation of similar crystals with no nicks. Overall Structure of the Complex The stoichiometry of the complex and the orientation of the heterodimer on the DNA agree with solution studies (Yang and Nash, 1989; Lee et al. 1992; Yang and Nash, 1994). Moreover, many of the contacts involve residues implicated by mutational evidence in DNA binding (Granston and Nash, 1993; Mengeritsky et al., 1993; Zulianello et al., 1995). The fold of IHF is essentially the same as that of HU (Tanaka et al., 1984; White et al., 1989): the bodies of the two proteins can be superim° posed with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.0 A (148 pairs of C atoms). The only major difference concerns the ribbon arms, which were partially disordered in the HU structure but can be traced in their entirety in the IHF-DNA complex structure. The conformation of the turn at the tips of the arms in our structure agrees with

the nuclear magnetic resonance structure of HU (Vis et al., 1995). The DNA executes a U-turn as it wraps around the protein. If only the 35 bp found in 1 asymmetric unit are considered, the bend angle is 160 (Figures 2A and 2B). The DNA fragments in the crystal are packed endto-end to form a pseudocontinuous helix. If contacts to these neighbors are taken into account (Figure 2D), the overall bend may exceed 180 . As predicted, the arms curl around the DNA and interact exclusively with the minor groove. Most of the bending occurs at two large kinks, 9 bp apart, where a proline at the tip of each arm is intercalated between base pairs (Figure 3). Although the overall arrangement of the complex displays pseudo-2-fold symmetry, it is asymmetric in detail. For example, the pseudo-2-fold in the DNA is offset by ° 1.7 A from that of the protein heterodimer. The bend in the DNA is stabilized by multiple interac° tions with the body of the protein. A total of 4650 A2 of previously solvent-accessible protein and DNA surface area, much of it hydrophilic, is buried at the complex

° interface (calculated by ACCESS, using a 1.4 A probe [Lee and Richards, 1971]). In addition to contacts with 26 positively charged side chains, the phosphate backbone also interacts with the N-termini of all six helices in the heterodimer. The ends of helices 1 and 3, on the sides of the protein, bind to opposite sides of the minor groove, forming a clamp described in detail below. Helix 2 makes hydrogen bonds from the bottom of the protein to adjacent DNA fragments in the crystal (Figure 2D). Hydroxyl radical­footprinting data suggest that these represent contacts made in solution to the outer edges of a longer DNA binding site (Yang and Nash, 1989). The DNA lies largely in a single plane, making a dihedral angle of only 10 ­15 . While small, the handedness of this angle is consistent with the placement of IHF at a node of a negatively supercoiled plasmid, as proposed by Nunes-Duby et al. (1995). However, since IHF binds with similar affinities to sites on supercoiled and linear DNAs (Yang and Nash, 1995), this tendency must not be large. Moreover, although there are large local variations in the helical twist, the average is 33.3 . Therefore,

The small out-of-plane component of the bend ( 10 ­15 ) can be seen. Note that the complex is asymmetric in detail. (C) Sequences and secondary structure of the two subunits. Residues strictly conserved in at least 90% of available IHF/HU sequences are in bold. Strands 2 and 3, which compose the arms, are subdivided at a point where the hydrogen bonding pattern is interrupted. (D) Crystal packing: 5 asymmetric units are shown. The DNA fragments are packed in an end-to-end fashion, forming a pseudocontinuous helix that zigzags through the crystal. The N-terminus of helix 2 from each subunit contacts a phosphate of the adjacent DNA fragment, and if these contacts are taken into account, the bend angle is somewhat >180 .

no significant underwinding of the DNA takes place, such as that noted in the complexes of TBP and HMG domains with DNA (Kim et al. 1993a, 1993b; Love et al., 1995; Werner et al., 1995). Proline is Intercalated at Two Large Kinks Proteins that induce large bends in DNA generally do so at least in part by introducing kinks, that is, concentrating the bending into one or a few large roll angles, where stacking between bases is disrupted. Although the kink can remain open to the solvent, as in the case of the CAP-DNA complex (Schultz et al., 1991), several other bending proteins, such as TBP, the lacI family, and the HMG domains, fill it by insertion of a hydrophobic side chain (reviewed in Werner et al., 1996). IHF introduces two very large kinks (Figure 4), where the proline at the tip of each arm is intercalated between base pairs. Although the protein families that display intercalation and kinking are structurally unrelated to one another and use a variety of intercalating side chains, all intercalate from the minor groove side. The proline used by IHF is conserved in every known member of the HU/IHF family. Proline may be favored over other side chains in this case for multiple reasons.

Its width allows extensive hydrophobic contact with the DNA bases, while its stubbiness allows formation of a hydrogen bond between the peptide backbone of the arm and N3 of the adenine immediately 5 to each kink. Indeed, substitution of N3 deazaadenine at this position decreases the affinity of IHF by 10-fold (Wang et al., 1995). A longer side chain might push the peptide backbone away from the DNA, disrupting this hydrogen bond. However, a P-to-L mutation in the IHF arm is tolerated, albeit with effects on the specificity of binding (Lee et al., 1992). Proline may also stabilize the structure of the turn at the tip of the arm. In the IHF complex, the DNA flanking the kinks quickly returns to a more canonical B-form structure, and within half a turn in either direction, the minor groove is unusually narrow (Figure 4). In contrast, TBP and the HMG domains bend the DNA more continuously by inserting a "wedge" of several hydrophobic side chains into the minor groove, keeping it unusually wide over several base pairs. Also unlike these proteins, IHF makes only a few hydrophobic contacts with the DNA, and these are with the sugar moieties of the backbone rather than the floor of the minor groove. The most highly conserved such contacts are formed by two residues from each

arm (I71 /V70 and I73 /L72 ) that pack against the sugar moieties of the backbone adjacent to the kink. V, I, L, or M is found at these positions in all known HU/ IHF proteins. Additional hydrophobic contacts to the DNA backbone are made by P61 of the arm and the aliphatic portions of several charged side chains. The Sides of the Protein Act as Clamps The peptide backbone on each side of the body forms a tripartite clamp that binds across the minor groove (Figure 5). At the center of this clamp is the turn between strands 1 and 2, which lies between two phosphates on opposite sides of the minor groove and is hydrogen bonded to both via successive amide nitrogens. The same two phosphates interact with the N-termini of helices 1 and 3. This explains the effects of mutations near

the N-termini of these helices, which interfere with DNA binding (Mengeritsky et al. 1993, Toussaint et al., 1994). On the right side of the complex, this clamp straddles the second portion of the consensus sequence, and R46 extends from the 1­2 turn, contacting the edges of conserved bases. On the left side, it straddles the minor groove of the A tract but makes no direct contacts with the bases. This rather rigid interaction requires an unusually narrow minor groove (see Figure 4). On the right side, the narrow minor groove is probably at least partially induced by the protein, but on the left, as discussed below, it is supplied by the A tract. Recognition of the A-Tract Structure Crystallographic studies of DNA oligomers have shown that A tracts display several unusual features: they tend to be straight, have a narrow minor groove, and a high propeller twist between paired bases (Nelson et al., 1987; DiGabriele et al., 1989; DiGabriele and Steitz, 1993; reviewed by Dickerson et al., 1994). Despite the gross distortions elsewhere in the DNA in our structure, the A tract retains all of these features. In fact, it can be superimposed on the Nelson et al. (1987) dodecamer ° with a root mean square deviation of only 0.6 A for all atoms in the run of six A­T bp. The interaction of IHF with the A tract is a clear example of DNA sequence recognition through structure rather than by base-specific contact: A tracts are preferred in this region because they adopt a conformation with a narrow minor groove that fits better into the protein clamp. A well-ordered string of water molecules, dubbed a "spine of hydration", has been noted in the narrow minor groove of A tracts (DiGabriele and Steitz, 1993; reviewed by Berman, 1994). We see a similar water structure not only in the A tract but also between the two kinks where the minor groove is also unusually narrow. At both places, the minor groove faces the protein, thus shielding the spine of hydration from bulk solvent, potentially leaving unsatisfied hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. In the A-tract region, S47 from the 1­2 turn points into the groove to provide a donor/acceptor group. On the top surface of the protein "body", the three strands of each subunit do not meet to form a seamless six-stranded sheet but rather are bridged

The minor groove of standard B-form DNA is 6 ° A (Stofer and Lavery, 1994). No points are plotted for bp 28 and 29, which are in non-Watson­Crick configurations.

The six-base A tract is lavender; other DNA, blue, with P atoms highlighted in red. Two water molecules involved in the hydrogen bonding scheme are shown as red dots. Phosphates on opposite sides of the minor groove make hydrogen bonds to the amino termini of helices 1 and 3 and to successive amide nitrogens from the turn between strands 1 and 2. S47 makes hydrogen bonds to the spine of hydration in the minor groove (not shown). (B) The right side: close-up of the right side of the complex, rotated 180 from Figure 2A. Color scheme is as in (a), with the three consensus sequence bases in green. The hydrogen bonding scheme between the phosphates and the protein backbone is similar. R46 is hydrogen bonded to O2 of T44; other water-mediated hydrogen bonds are omitted for clarity. E44 probably acts as a buttress, holding R46 in place.

by a row of ordered water molecules, as has been noted for HU in the absence of DNA (S. White, personal communication). The narrow minor groove of the DNA lies parallel to the strands at this point, and a thin sheet of waters extends from those bridging the protein subunits to those forming the DNA's spine of hydration (Figure 6). The third region, where the minor groove is unusually narrow, comprises the second portion of the consensus sequence, and here R46 replaces the spine of hydration (Figure 5B). DNA Sequence Recognition Although nonrandom sequences are found throughout a 30 bp window in IHF binding sites, only two small segments show sufficiently strong conservation to deserve the term consensus (Craig and Nash, 1984; Goodrich et al., 1990; Nash, 1996). These two patches are contacted by different elements of IHF. The first patch, bp 33­38, is contacted by the arm of the IHF . Two arginines reach into the minor groove and make hydrogen bonds to conserved bases (Figure 7A). These arginines by themselves, however, do not fully explain the sequence specificity in this region, as all four bases have hydrogen bond acceptors in the position contacted. We suggest that these contacts help select an unusual DNA conformation that favors certain bases at these positions. Specificity, therefore, probably results from the sum of a large number of small interactions, only a few of which are described in detail below. Figure 7B shows the expected consequences of a C  purine transversion at position 36. This and position

37 are the only bases that are conserved in every known IHF binding site. These two bp are highly buckled due to the proline intercalation between positions 37 and 38. The buckling resolves asymmetrically at position 35, resulting in a tilt angle of 32 between T35 and C36. Replacing C36 with a purine, while still providing a hydrogen bond acceptor for R60 , would result in a steric clash with the neighboring purine. Resolving this clash by rotating the new purine out of the way would disrupt its hydrogen bond to R60. A transition from C to T at position 36 would raise a more subtle problem. Normally, the methyl group of T, which extends into the major groove, is packed against the base 5 to it, but the large tilt angle between bases seen here would leave it exposed to solvent. Similarly, the conservation of A37 may follow from the need to satisfy a highly distorted DNA structure and a limited number of protein contacts. A transversion from A to C or T would remove a van der Waals contact between the tip of the proline ring and the six-membered ring of the purine, while a transition to G would place an amino group in the minor groove. Also, the additional hydrogen bond in a G­C bp would increase the energetic cost of the buckle and propeller twist needed to accommodate the kink. The partial conservation of A38 can be similarly rationalized. Finally, the large roll angle between bp 37 and 38 allows an unusual interaction between the methyl groups in the major groove: that of T37 is inserted into a hydrophobic pocket between the ribose moiety and methyl of T38. Accordingly, removal of the methyl at either of these positions by substituting

C atoms are colored in accordance with Figure 2A IHF , white; IHF , pink; consensus sequence bases, green; and other DNA, pale blue. Only the protein backbone is shown. The view is twisted about a vertical axis from that of Figure 2A. The uppermost waters bridge O4's across the narrow minor groove, while the lowermost bridge the two three-stranded sheets.

I­C for A­T, which does not change the minor groove, reduces the apparent binding constant by 5-fold (S.-w. Y., unpublished data). There are no direct contacts with the protein at bp 33 and 34. The fact that either A or T can be found here suggests that capacity to adopt a narrow minor groove may be the selected feature. A similar explanation has been proposed for the preference of 434 repressor for operators with As and Ts in the central region that is not directly contacted by the protein (Koudelka et al., 1987). The arm of IHF is more deeply inserted into the minor groove than that of . Although this could be an artifact resulting from the nick in the DNA used for crystallization, which lies near the tip of the arm, it correlates with the lack of specificity in this region. The arm has arginines in corresponding places to those described above for , but they are farther from the DNA helix axis and only make contacts to the phosphate backbone or water-mediated contacts to the bases. In fact, the same two arginines are also found in most HU proteins, which show no detectable sequence specificity. The second portion of the consensus sequence (bp 43­45) is recognized by the body of the protein. As predicted (Zulianello et al., 1995), R46 extends from the 1­ 2 turn into the minor groove and makes either direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds to all three conserved bases (Figure 5B). Its guanidinium is centered in the groove, rather than lying to one side as do R60

and R63 . This positioning is enforced by a chain of salt bridges. Both sides of the carboxylate of E44 make salt bridges: one to the back side of the R46 guanidinium (Figure 5B) and the other to R42 (not shown). R42 in turn also makes a salt bridge to the phosphate of A41. Replacement of E44 with a variety of side chains relaxes the specificity for the identity of bp 44 (Lee et al., 1992; Hales et al., 1994b), probably by allowing greater flexibility to R46 . The narrowness of the minor groove at this point allows the aliphatic portion of R46 to make van der Waals contact with the ribose moieties of the DNA backbone on both sides of the groove. HU proteins generally have I or V at the corresponding position and probably also interact with the sides of the minor groove. However, this feature is not universal since S47 of IHF interacts with the spine of hydration rather than the sides of the groove. The requirement for a narrow minor groove and the central positioning of R46 within it explain the virtual absence of G­C or C­G bp with bulky amino groups at positions 43 and 44, but not the discrimination against T­A to A­T transversions, nor the preference for purines at position 45. Here, too, sequence-dependent conformability of DNA is probably an important factor in sequence recognition. It may be that a flexible Y­R step is needed here to allow the DNA to conform more easily to the shape required by the protein. The helical twist between T­A 44 and G­C 45 is 47.5 , which, in conjunction with an undertwisting at the next step, makes an

Figure 7. Interactions between the Arm and Conserved Bases and Consequences of Mutations at the Most Highly Conserved Positions (A) The protein C trace is shown in gray, with side chains that interact directly with the DNA shown in yellow. Carbons in the consensus sequence bases are green; others are blue. Other atoms are colored according to type: O, red; N, blue; and P, purple. Direct hydrogen bonds between the DNA bases and the protein are shown by dotted lines. The backbone NH of R63 makes a hydrogen bond to N3 of A37, in addition to those made by the guanidinium group. P65 (beneath I71) is intercalated between bp 37 and 38; while I71, I73, and P61 contact the ribose moieties of the backbone. The tip of K66 is not well ordered, but the aliphatic portion of this side chain makes hydrophobic contact with the floor of the minor groove. (B) The view is the same as in (a), but only the side chain of P65 is shown. Transversion mutations (C36  G; A37  T) have been modeled at the two most conserved positions with no other changes in the structure. Due to the tilt between the top strand bases at positions 35 and 36, a purine on the top strand at position 36 clashes ° with the preceding base (N3 of T35 and N1 of G36 are only 2.3 A apart). At position 37, moving the purine to the other strand removes a hydrophobic contact between the tip of the proline ring and the second ring of the base.

odd kink in the helix axis and adds to the overall bending. Y­R steps are unusually flexible, and T­G and T­A in particular have the highest observed twist angles and the widest spread of twist values among DNA structures (Suzuki and Yagi, 1995; reviewed in Luisi, 1995). Implications To bend DNA, proteins must offset the forces that normally keep it straight. The most important of these prob-

ably are the symmetric repulsion of the phosphate backbone charges and the favorable energy of base stacking. To counteract the former, proteins can place a large positive surface on the inside of the bend, thus asymmetrically neutralizing the double helix (Mirzabekov and Rich, 1979; Strauss and Maher, 1994), as exemplified by CAP (Schultz et al., 1991) and the nucleosome core. To counteract the latter, proteins can insert a hydrophobic residue between base pairs, stabilizing the disruption of base stacking, as do TBP and the HMG domains. IHF uses both strategies: the positively charged body of the protein lies on the inside of the bend, while the long ribbon arms reach around to the opposite face of the DNA and intercalate a hydrophobic residue into each of the two large kinks. In addition to bending the DNA, IHF also recognizes specific sequences. Sequence-dependent conformability of the DNA clearly plays a large role in this specificity, as evidenced by the dearth of direct protein­base contacts. This has also been proposed for TBP (Kim et al., 1993a, 1993b; Kim and Burley, 1994; Suzuki et al., 1996), and as the minor groove has far fewer unique features than the major groove, this may be a recurring theme among minor groove binding proteins. Of particular note is that the conformation of an A tract bound by IHF matches that of A tracts in crystals of naked duplex DNA (Nelson et al., 1987; DiGabriele et al., 1989; DiGabriele and Steitz, 1993) and, moreover, that the features of this A tract are exploited to generate optimal contacts with IHF. This result provides strong evidence that the A-tract structure observed in previous crystallographic studies is biologically relevant, and it strongly suggests that its characteristic features will be important recognition elements for other proteins that interact with A-rich sequences. HU is 40% identical in sequence to each subunit of IHF but binds DNA nonspecifically. Because many important features in DNA binding, such as the distribution of positive charge and the prolines at the tips of the arms, are conserved between the two proteins, it is reasonable to expect that the HU­DNA complex will be very similar to that of IHF. Indeed, footprinting studies using chemically modified HU protein localized in a DNA loop provide strong support for this mode of binding (Lavoie et al., 1996). The added sequence specificity of IHF probably results from the sum of a number of small differences between the two proteins. The most obvious is R46 of IHF that contacts conserved bases but is generally replaced with V or I in HU proteins. There is also a subtle structural difference in this region: compared to HU and ° IHF , helix 1 of IHF is axially displaced by 1.3 A toward its C-terminus. This allows the phosphate closest to its N-terminus (Figure 5B) to be tucked deeper into the protein, resulting in the odd variation in twist at this position, discussed above. Explaining why the arm of IHF but not that of IHF or HU recognizes a specific DNA sequence is less straightforward. The only side chains that make direct hydrogen bonds (R60 and R63) are found in nearly all family members, regardless of sequence specificity. It could be that the difference lies not in the arm but in how the DNA is arranged in the complex. Thus, the asymmetry of interactions between DNA and IHF may drive the two arms to make different

RNA polymerase to initiate transcription (see Goosen and van de Putte, 1995, for a review). Perhaps rather than making a direct protein­protein interaction, IHF favorably presents a portion of the promoter sequence to the relevant portion of RNA polymerase.
Experimental Procedures Sample Preparation The strain used for overproduction of E. coli IHF and the initial steps of the purification were described previously (Nash et al., 1987). The resulting phosphocellulose column fractions were applied to a Mono S column (Pharmacia) and eluted with a 0.075­0.65 M NaCl gradient in 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.5), 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol. The middle fractions of the peak were rechromatographed under the same conditions. Purified IHF was concentrated on a Mono S column and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mM (NH4 )2SO4 , 0.5 mM EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol. Most oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent (Midland, TX) with the 5 -trityl on. They were purified on a C4 column (VYDAC) with a 15%­35% acetonitrile gradient in 50 mM triethylamine acetate (pH 6.8). After detritylation, they were further purified on a Mono Q column (Pharmacia, 0.52­0.7 M NaCl gradient in 0.01 M NaOH), followed by C4 column chromatography (7.5%­ 15% acetonitrile gradient, in 50 mM triethylamine acetate). The purity of the fractions to be pooled was determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis of 32P-labeled samples. Iodinated oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Gene Assembler (Pharmacia) using a 5-iododU phosphoamidite (Glen Research, VA) and were purified as above under red light. The 35 base strand of H 1N was synthesized on an Expedite model 8909 synthesizer (Perseptive) using a modified cycle to reduce products with missing nucleotides. It was purified through a C4 column (Rainin, 20%­40% acetonitrile gradient in 100 mM triethylamine acetate) and a mono Q column (Pharmacia, 0.55­0.85 M NaCl gradient in 0.01 M NaOH), before and after detritylation, respectively. Gel-filled capillary electrophoresis (Beckman) was used to examine column fractions before pooling and to monitor the detritylation reaction. Crystals were grown at room temperature by the hanging drop method. Protein ( 23 mg/ml; 1 mM), in the buffer described above, was mixed in a 1:1 volume ratio with 1.5 mM DNA, in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.4) and 50 mM NaCl. After 20 min at room temperature, the mixture was combined in a 1:1 ratio with well solution containing 20%­23% polyethylene glycol 4000, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM spermine, 5%­15% glycerol, 15 mM CdCl2, 0.3% NaN3, and 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5). Mg2 could replace Cd 2 to obtain the same crystal form, with a different growth habit. The space group was P21 21 21 , with one complex per asymmetric unit. A variety of DNA lengths and overhang configurations was tested for crystallization, using the combinatorial strategy of Schultz et al. (1990), but only the ones shown in Figure 1A and a permuted variant of them formed crystals. Structure Determination The derivatives used for the MIRAS phasing are listed in Table 1. All crystals used for phase determination contained site H 2N. Data were collected on an Raxis IIc, mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode with double focusing mirrors and a Ni filter, and reduced and scaled using the HKL suite of programs (Minor, 1993; Otwinowski, 1993). All data sets were highly anisotropic, as can be seen for the final native in Table 1. Overall scale and B factors between derivative and native data sets were applied using SCALEPACK, followed by local scaling using DSCALEAD (written by Mark Rould, MIT). Phases were determined independently by MIRAS for the room and low temperature sets of data (Table 1), and the resulting maps were averaged. This combined the better phasing power at low resolution from the room temperature data with the higher resolution information provided by the frozen data. Room temperature data were collected from crystals stabilized in the same buffer in which they were grown, with the polyethylene glycol/glycerol concentrations adjusted to 20%/15%, respectively, for the derivatives and 22.5%/5% for the native. For flash freezing, 30% polyethylene glycol/15% glycerol were used. This improved

Figure 8. Model for IHF-Induced Juxtaposition of Binding Sites in a Nucleoprotein Array The model shows a portion of attL, one of the partners involved in the excision of prophage. This segment of DNA binds one protomer of IHF and one protomer of the 40 kDa integrase (Int; shown in green). The Int protomer recognizes two segments of attL (C and Pl ; shown in lavender) with its large and small domains, respectively (Kim et al., 1990). To estimate the positions of these Int binding sites in the complex, B-form DNA extensions were modeled onto the ends of the duplex in the IHF-DNA structure. This shows that bending due to IHF can expedite Int binding by bringing the phos° phate backbones of the C and Pl binding sites to within 25 A of each other.

interactions with the minor groove. However, there are some unique features in the amino acid sequences of IHF arms, including two prolines (61 and 72). These may rigidify the arm, making it more effective in filtering DNA sequences. IHF contributes to the biological function of numerous prokaryotic systems. Our determination of the shape of DNA induced by IHF opens the way for a better insight into its mode of action. For example, the spatial relationship between the major components in an array that IHF facilitates, such as protomers of Int protein in an attachment site for phage (Figure 8) or dnaA protein in the E. coli origin of replication (Roth et al., 1994), can now be deduced, and models for the resulting higher order structure can be refined. It is also interesting that there is a large expanse of major groove within the IHF complex that is still available for interaction with other proteins. Indeed, these sequences may be enhanced as potential binding sites for other molecules because of the widening of the major groove that is the counterpart of IHF-induced narrowing of the minor groove. For example, it has been suggested that IHF can directly assist

mechanical stability but shrank the unit cell by >10% and increased nonisomorphism among crystals. MLPHARE was used for refinement of heavy atom positions and phase calculations (CCP4, 1979; Otwinowski, 1991). Phases for the ° room temperature data, calculated at a nominal resolution of 3.2 A, were improved by solvent flattening and histogram matching using SQUASH (Zhang, 1993). Heavy atom parameters were subsequently re-refined against solvent-flattened phases. The cell dimension change prevented location of heavy atoms in the frozen data sets by difference Fourier. Therefore, the room temperature map was skeletonized using MAPMAN (Kleywegt and Jones, 1996). An asymmetric unit of "bones" atoms were then re¨ fined in XPLOR (Brunger, 1992) as a rigid body against the frozen native data, giving a rotation of a few degrees. Phases derived from these coordinates were sufficient to locate two Cd 2 binding sites in the frozen native data set. SIGMAA (CCP4, 1979; Read, 1986) was used to combine phases based on the Cd2 anomalous differences with the molecular replacement phases, followed by solvent flattening and histogram matching with SQUASH. The resulting map was averaged with the best room temperature map using the RAVE suite (Kleywegt and Jones, 1994). Eight cycles were carried out in which, after each averaging step, new maps were generated as follows: for the room temperature data, SIGMAA was used to combine phases based on the averaged map with the original MIRAS phases, while for the frozen data only, phases based on the averaged map were used. This produced a great improvement in the frozen map but very little improvement in the room temperature map. Phases provided by the averaged frozen density map were of sufficient quality to locate five more Cd 2 binding sites in the frozen native anomalous Fourier, as well as the two poorly ordered iodines in "iodine3." Phases calculated solely from the heavy atom positions were then improved by solvent flattening, using the RAVE suite and the mask created from the bones atoms. This map was again averaged with the best room temperature density map, this time using SIGMAA phase combination between cycles for both maps, resulting in an improvement in both maps. Model Building and Refinement The model was built using both averaged maps and the program "O" (Jones et al., 1991). Refined HU coordinates (S. White, personal communication) provided the starting point for the protein portion of the model. It was refined initially against data collected at 180 at the NSLS, beam line X4A, from a crystal grown using H 2N DNA (data not shown). Data for the final refinement were collected at 180 on the Raxis IIc described above, from a crystal containing H 1N DNA (Table 1). The structure was refined by simulated annealing and energy minimization using XPLOR v3.1 and v3.816 (A.T. ¨ Brunger and J. Jiang, personal communication). The Fobs were anisotropically scaled to match Fcalc, resulting in an 5% drop in ° both R and Rfree and a difference between B22 and B33 of 40.4 A2. The overall B on the coordinates was adjusted such that the sum B22 B33) of the matrix that was applied to Fo was 0. The (B11 individual scale factors were stored and used as weights during refinement to compensate for the scaling up of weak reflections and scaling down of strong ones. Subsequent local scaling of Fobs to Fcalc resulted in almost no change in R or Rfree. All data with F > ° 0 between 15 and 2.2 A were included in the refinement, and a bulk solvent correction was applied. As 15 Cd2 could be located in the native anomalous difference Fourier, Friedel pairs were kept separate during refinement, and the scattering factors for Cd 2 were modified accordingly. Of the data, 5% was reserved for Rfree. The same test set was maintained when switching native data sets, and Friedel mates of test reflections were also included in the test set. The protein stereochemical parameters of Engh and Huber (1991) and the nucleic acid parameters of Parkinson et al. (1996) were used. The DNA backbone dihedral angles, except those in clearly distorted regions, were restrained to those of B-form DNA until the final stages of energy minimization. Figure Preparation Figures 2A, 2B, 2D, 3, and 5­8 were made with RIBBONS (Carson, 1991) and SGI Showcase, and O (Jones et al., 1991) was used for Figure 1B.
