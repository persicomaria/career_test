Abstract Budding yeast Dsk2 is a family of UbL­UBA proteins that can interact with both polyubiquitin and the proteasome, and is thereby thought to function as a shuttle protein in the ubiquitin­proteasome pathway. Here we show that Dsk2 can homodimerize via its C-terminal UBA domain in the absence of ubiquitin. Dsk2 mutants defective in the UBA domain do not dimerize and do not bind polyubiquitin. The expression of Dsk2 UBA mutants fails to restore the growth defect caused by DSK2 disruption although that of wild-type Dsk2 can restore the defect. These results suggest that Dsk2 homodimerization via the UBA domain plays a role in regulating polyubiquitin binding in the ubiquitin­proteasome pathway. Ó 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Dsk2 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae belongs to a family of proteins that contain a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain at the C-terminus and a ubiquitin-like (UbL) domain at the N-terminus. Through the abilities of the UBA domain to bind to polyubiquitin and the UbL domain to interact with receptors on the proteasome, Dsk2 appears to function as a shuttle protein to link the ubiquitin system to the function of the proteasome [1­4]. The shuttling function of Dsk2 overlaps partially with that of Rad23 [5­10], a protein that also contains a UBA domain towards C-terminus. Polyubiquitin chains bound to these shuttle proteins are recognized by the subunits of the proteasome base component, Rpn10/S5a [11­13] and Rpn1 [3,14,15]. It has been indicated that Rpn1, the largest subunit of the base component, specifically recognizes the UbL domain of Rad23 through its leucine-rich-repeat-like

(LRR-like) domain, and that the UbL domain of Dsk2 can compete with Rad23 for this interaction [14]. Rpn10/S5a, however, possesses a ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) [16] and mediates association of polyubiquitinated substrates and Rpn1, through its ability to bind both to polyubiquitin chains and to the middle repetitive sequences (PC repeat) of Rpn1 [14]. Both Rpn10/S5a and Rpn1 have been shown to function as proteasomal polyubiquitin receptors in targeting polyubiquitinated substrates onto the proteasome in two alternative pathways [17,18]. Three ubiquitin-interacting domains have been mainly characterized: the UBA domain, the UIM [19], and the CUE (coupling of ubiquitin conjugation to ER degradation) domain [20]. They each have a characteristic preference for binding mono- or polyubiquitin. The UBA domain binds preferentially to polyubiquitin [1,3], whereas the UIM binds to both poly- and monoubiquitin but with less affinity. The CUE domain binds preferentially to monoubiquitin [20,21]. The UBA domains of Dsk2 and Rad23 bind tightly to polyubiquitinated proteins [1,3,4,9,14]. Recent findings have advanced our understanding of the molecular basis of the UBA domain-containing proteins

in the ubiquitin­proteasome pathway, and structural analysis of Dsk2 UBA domain has proved that the UBA domain is important as molecular determinants for ubiquitin recognition [22]. In this report, we present evidence that Dsk2 homodimerization via its UBA domain is required for its polyubiquitin-binding activity. We discuss that Dsk2 dimer formation via its UBA domain may play an important part in the ubiquitin­proteasome pathway. Materials and methods
Strains, plasmids, and media. Saccharomyces cerevisiae YPH499 (MATa ade2-101 leu2-D1 trp1-D63 ura3-52 lys2-801 his3-D200) [23] was used as the wild-type strain and Y190 [24] was used in two-hybrid screening as described [1]. Mutant strain dsk2D, media, and growth were as described [1]. To disrupt RAD23, a 420-bp EcoRI­XhoI fragment upstream of the RAD23 ORF was amplified by PCR (primer: 5 0 -CATATGAAGTAC GAATTCATATAGTGTACA-3 0 and 5 0 -AAAATCGATTTTTCTATT GTATGTTGTCTT-3 0 ) and a 520-bp EcoRI­ClaI fragment downstream of the RAD23 ORF was amplified by PCR (primer: 5 0 -TCACTCGA GTGAGATTGTAGTAATGTTATG-3 0 and 5 0 -TTCGTTGGATTTGA ATTCTTATATAGATGG-3 0 ). These two fragments were subcloned into the pRS404. To make the dsk2Drad23D double mutant, the resultant plasmid was digested by EcoRI and transformed into a dsk2D strain. Disruption of RAD23 was checked by PCR. Plasmids carrying the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged version, pEG-KG-DSK2 for expression in yeast and pGEX-KG-DSK2 for recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli, were described previously [1]. A vector carrying the HAtagged version, pGAL1-YEplac112-HA-DSK2, was constructed from pGAL1-YEplac112-cyclin A1 [25] and used as a yeast expression vector. A single-copy plasmid pRS316 harboring wild-type DSK2 and its endogenous promoter, and a multi-copy plasmid pGAL1-YEplac195 are described [1]. Construction of Dsk2 mutants. DSK2 deletions were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis using pRS316-DSK2 as the template. Deletion constructs were subcloned into pBluescriptIISK+ cut with XbaI and SpeI and then the XbaI­SpeI fragment was re-subcloned into pGAL1-YEplac112-HA-DSK2 cut with the same enzymes. GST-tagged versions were constructed by subcloning the XbaI­HindIII fragment into the XbaI­ HindIII sites of pEG-KG or of pGEX-KG [1]. Two cloning strategies were used to prepare the alanine-scanning mutants of the UBA domains. For the HA-tagged versions, a 319 bp KpnI fragment of pGAL1-YEplac112HA-DSK2, which contains the Dsk2 C-terminal UBA domain (residues 269­373), was subcloned into the KpnI site of pBluescriptIISK+. After being mutagenized by a site-directed PCR method, these mutated SpeI­KpnI fragments were subcloned into the KpnI­SpeI sites of pGAL1YEplac112-HA-DSK2. For the GST-tagged versions, Dsk2 C-terminal KpnI­HindIII fragments were subcloned into KpnI­HindIII cut pBluescriptIISK+. These mutated KpnI­HindIII fragments in pBluescriptIISK+-DSK2 were then used to replace the corresponding wild-type KpnI­ HindIII fragment within pEG-KG-DSK2 or pGEX-KG-DSK2. GST-pull down and ubiquitin binding in vitro. For GST-pull-down experiments, DSK2 harboring plasmids (pEG-KG-DSK2 and pGAL1YEplac112-HA-DSK2) were transformed into yeast strain dsk2D and coexpressed in minimal medium containing 2% raffinose at 30 °C up to an OD600 of 0.8. Two percent galactose was then added to the medium and the cells were further incubated for 4 h. Experimental procedures for immunoblotting, GST-pull down, and recombinant GST-Dsk2 preparation were essentially the same as described [1,25]. For ubiquitin-binding assays, recombinant GST-Dsk2 mutant proteins (3 lg) were incubated with either 0.4 lg tetraubiquitin (AFFINITI, Exeter, UK), 1 lg monoubiquitin (Sigma) or 1 lg polyubiquitin chains (AFFINITI) in 500 ll lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP40, 0.01% BSA, 1 mM APMSF, and 1 lg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin) for 2 h at 4 °C. ubiquitin bound to GST-Dsk2 was detected by SDS­PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody.

Sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Six micrograms of recombinant Dsk2 was layered over a 5 ml pre-chilled 5­30% (w/v) sucrose density gradient in A-buffer (25 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM APMSF, and 1 lg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin) and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm (190,000g) for 16 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 0.4 ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube and the proteins were precipitated with 10% TCA using Triton X-100 as the carrier. The precipitates were then subjected to SDS­PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Dsk2 antibody. Cell extracts (10 OD600) in A-buffer were centrifuged as described above, and each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting with either anti-Dsk2 or anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Expression of Dsk2 and its UBA mutants for the rescue of the growth defect of a dsk2 disruptant. A dsk2Drad23D strain was transformed either by galactose-inducible multi-copy plasmid YEplac195 harboring the Dsk2 UBA mutant (GS359AA and LL368AA) or by a single-copy plasmid pRS316 harboring DSK2 and its endogenous promoter [1]. To test the protein levels of the UBA mutants, each transformant (initial OD600 = 0.4) was cultured at 30 °C in minimal medium containing 2% raffinose. After incubation for 2 h, 2% galactose was added to the medium and cells were further incubated at 30 °C for 5 or 10 h. To induce these proteins at 36 °C, after being incubated at 30 °C more for 1 h by adding galactose, cells were transferred to 36 °C for 3 h. Cell extracts were prepared as described [1], followed by immunoblotting with anti-Dsk2 and anti-Cdc28 antibodies. Rescue of the temperature-sensitive growth of a dsk2Drad23D strain by ectopic expression of Dsk2 and its UBA mutants was tested in minimal medium plate containing 2% galactose.

Results Dsk2 homodimerization requires its C-terminal UBA domain Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we screened a S. cerevisiae library for proteins that interact with Dsk2. Among 1.5 · 105 transformants, four out of 42 strongly interacting clones were identified as Dsk2 itself. To confirm the Dsk2­Dsk2 interaction, we carried out further assays. First, we showed that cloned Dsk2 interacts with endogenous Dsk2 in two-hybrid assays using either prototrophic growth or b-galactosidase activity as a reporter of the interaction (Fig. 1A). As already reported in part, another 17 clones obtained in this screen were ubiquitin genes fused to ribosomal proteins (UBI1-3) [1]. Second, we used a GST-pull down assay using GST-Dsk2 and HA-Dsk2 followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody of yeast cell extracts (Fig. 1C, lane 4). To characterize the interaction, we tested which domain of Dsk2 is required for Dsk2 homodimerization by using a series of GST-Dsk2 deletion mutants (Figs. 1B and C). The N-terminally truncated mutants (Fig. 1C, lanes 6 and 7) and the C-terminal UBA domain alone (lane 8) bound to full-length Dsk2. In contrast, neither the N-terminal UbL domain alone (lane 5) nor C-terminally truncated mutants (lanes 10­12), all of which lack the UBA domain, bound to full-length Dsk2. Truncation of the UBA domain (residues 336­373) abolished its ability to bind full-length Dsk2 (lane 9). Therefore, the C-terminal UBA domain of Dsk2 is required for Dsk2 dimerization. Next, to define the region of Dsk2 that is required for its association with the UBA domain, the binding of a minimal Dsk2 fragment (residues 328­373) to a series of GST-Dsk2 mutants was examined

(Fig. 1D). Dsk2 mutants that possess the C-terminal UBA domain bound to Dsk2 (residues 328­373) (lanes 4­6), whereas the mutants lacking the UBA domain did not (lanes 8­10). A short N-terminal deletion within the UBA domain abolished its binding ability (lane 7). Because some of the Dsk2 mutants (residues 1­215 and residues 1­327) were poorly expressed in cells, recombinant GST-Dsk2 mutant proteins were purified and used for in vitro-binding assay. This in vitro assay gave the same results (see Fig. 1B). Therefore, the C-terminal UBA domain (residues 328­373) is the minimal sequence required for homodimerization of Dsk2. Finally, we used sucrose density sedimentation as a further method for assessing Dsk2 association. Purified recombinant Dsk2 sedimented as two peaks, of molecular sizes consistent with monomeric and dimeric species (Fig. 1E, upper panel). In contrast, the mutant lacking the C-terminal UBA domain (residues 1­327) failed to form a homodimer (lower panel). Taken together, these results indicate that Dsk2 forms a homodimer via its C-terminal UBA domain. Next, we confirmed that dimeric Dsk2 preferentially binds to polyubiquitin in yeast cells (Fig. 2).

detectable in the higher molecular-weight fractions and little Dsk2 dimer is apparent (double asterisks). These high-molecular-weight fractions also contained polyubiquitin (middle panel). Monoubiquitin did not co-sediment with Dsk2-monomer or with high-molecular-weight Dsk2, but was detectable in the low-molecular-weight fractions (lower panel). This in vivo analysis suggests that dimeric Dsk2 via its UBA domain binds to polyubiquitin, but not to monoubiquitin. Mutations within the Dsk2 UBA domain prevent both its homodimerization and polyubiquitin binding We next generated a series of alanine-substituted mutants in the conserved residues of the Dsk2 UBA domain (Fig. 3A) and analyzed the effects of these mutations on the ability of Dsk2 to homodimerize and to bind poly-

ubiquitin. Mutations in a loop between helix a1 and a2 (GF343AA), and in helix a3 (LL368AA) abolished both functions (Fig. 3B, lanes 8 and 11). Other mutations in helix a2 (L354A, lane 9) and a loop between helix a2 and a3 (GS359AA, lane 10) yielded proteins with impaired abilities to both homodimerize and to bind polyubiquitin. For each UBA mutant tested the interaction with polyubiquitin and the degree of homodimerization were similarly affected. A mutation in helix a1 (LR336AA) had little affect on both polyubiquitin binding and homodimerization (lane 7). Therefore, two sites within the Dsk2 UBA domain are essential for homodimerization and polyubiquitin binding: the hinge region between helix a1 and a2, and helix a3. Binding of monoubiquitin to the UBA mutants or to wild-type Dsk2 was not detected (Fig. 3B, lower panel). Taking the results from this series of analyses together, we conclude that Dsk2 can form a homodimer via its UBA domain, and that dimeric Dsk2 preferentially binds to polyubiquitin. Dsk2 UBA mutants fail to restore the growth defect caused by a disruption of DSK2 Rescue experiments to elaborate the function of the UBA domain in yeast have been carried out without the Dsk2 protein levels being determined [4,26]. In the course of our experiments, we noticed that the protein levels of the Dsk2 UBA mutants expressed from a single-copy number plasmid are very low (e.g., the protein level of LL368AA is less than 1/20 that of wild-type Dsk2, data not shown). Therefore, we have had to re-investigate whether the Dsk2 UBA domain is required for the in vivo function of Dsk2 (Fig. 4). First, we found that the UBA mutant protein levels are maintained in cells by continuous expression from a multi-copy vector (Fig. 4A). The protein levels of GS359AA (upper panel, lanes 7­9) and LL368AA (lanes 10­12), as well as that of wild-type Dsk2 from a single-copy vector (lanes 4­6), are similar to that of endogenous Dsk2 (lanes 1­3). Next, we tested whether or not the UBA mutants can restore the growth defect caused by DSK2 disruption. Although a disruption of DSK2 alone is viable, a strain deleted for DSK2 and RAD23 is temperature sensitive for growth [5]. Then, we confirmed that the Dsk2 protein was also expressed similarly at 36 °C in both wild-type Dsk2 (lower panel, lane 3) and the UBA mutants (lanes 5 and 6). Under these conditions, the expression of the UBA mutants (GS359AA or LL368AA) failed to restore the temperature-sensitive growth defect of dsk2Drad23D, whereas wild-type Dsk2 was able to restore the defect (Fig. 4B). Thus, the UBA domain is required for Dsk2 function in vivo. Discussion The UBA domain is a highly conserved domain of 40­50 amino acid residues that consists of three compact a helices [22,27­30].

Dsk2 expressed from galactose-inducible single-copy pGAL1-YCplac33 also maintained the protein level and rescued the growth defect of dsk2Drad23D (data not shown).

UBA interacts with a hydrophobic surface on ubiquitin composed of residues Leu8, Ile44, and Val70 [31,32]. Our data in this report indicate that Dsk2 can form a homodimer via its UBA domain in the absence of ubiquitin and that Dsk2 mutants defective in the UBA domain prevent not only its homodimerization but also polyubiquitin binding. Dsk2 dimerized via UBA domain binds to polyubiquitin, but not to monoubiquitin. It thus appears that polyubiquitin binding prefers dimerized Dsk2 via the UBA domain. A hydrophobic patch on the surface of the UBA dimer composed of two motifs, the loop between helix a1 and a2 (G343F344) and the helix a3 (L368L369) containing a putative UIM, is important for an efficient interaction with polyubiquitin. Our results on the motifs of the UBA domain (G343F344 and L368L369) presented are consistent with those of the CUE domain study, the sequences of which resemble each other [20]. However, the two domains have different affinities for ubiquitin. The dimeric UBA domain

of Dsk2 binds preferentially to polyubiquitin (this work), while the dimeric CUE domain binds to monoubiquitin preferentially but weakly [21]. There is a difference of 300-fold or more in the affinities of the UBA domain for polyubiquitin and the CUE domain for monoubiquitin. By contrast, the affinities of the UBA domain and the CUE domain for monoubiquitin is similar and is relatively low. The dissociation constants (Kd) are 20 lM for CUE:Vps9 [20,21], 8­10 lM for Rad23/Ddi1:monoubiquitin, and 30 nM for Ddi1:tertaubiquitin [3], respectively. Compared to the CUE domain, the UBA domain binds efficiently to polyubiquitin. In this report, we have shown for the first time by the growth-rescue experiment that the Dsk2 UBA domain is required for a cellular function of Dsk2 (Fig. 4), the result of which indicates requirement of UBA domain in Dsk2 function in yeast cells. Dsk2 via its UBA domain plays an important role in the delivery of polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome [1]. Dsk2 acts as a shuttle factor in this pathway. Full-length Dsk2 is a stable protein with a long half-life [5], but Dsk2 UBA mutant proteins became extremely unstable (our unpublished results). Requirement of UBA domain for an intrinsic stabilization signal has been recently shown in Rad23 UBA domain [33]. The UBA domain of Dsk2 seems to be important not only in Dsk2 stability but also in the inter-conversion of Dsk2 between monomer and dimer states. Since the C-terminal UBA domain and the N-terminal UbL domain of Dsk2 cannot interact with each other (Fig. 1), Dsk2 can form a dimer not via the UbL­UBA interaction but via the UBA­UBA interaction. The conversion between monomer and dimer states via its UBA domain may be important for Dsk2 function in the ubiquitin­proteasome pathway, of which conformational change on dimerization confers an ability to bind polyubiquitin chains with high affinity. Either, Dsk2 dimerization via its UBA domain may help to sequestrate and protect from its degradation, for a fraction of Dsk2 dimer was detected as a minor peak in the sedimentation profile (Fig. 1E). Besides Dsk2, two other proteins, Rad23 [34] and Ddi1 [35], have been shown to bind to ubiquitin [3,4,8,26,36] and to share the receptor sites of Rpn1 in binding the proteasome [14]. Genetic evidence shows the functional redundancy of these UBA domain proteins in cells [5,10], and Rad23 and Ddi1 can form homo- and hetero-dimer [36]. However, the ability of dimeric Dsk2 on polyubiquitin binding seems to be different with previously reported results from Rad23 and Ddi1 [36]. Heterodimerization via these UBA domains may also modulate the ability of these UBA-containing proteins to bind polyubiquitin chains [37], those of which might explain overlapping functions of these proteins.
