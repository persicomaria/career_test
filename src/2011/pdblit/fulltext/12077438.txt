The major allergen Phlp 5b from timothy grass pollen induces allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma in millions of allergic patients worldwide. As an important step towards understanding the interactions between the pollen protein and components of the human immune system, the structure of the C-terminal key domain of Phlp 5b has been determined at Ê 2.0 A resolution and re®ned to an R value of 19.7%. This is the ®rst known allergen composed entirely of -helices. The protein forms a dimer stabilized by one intermolecular disul®de bridge. Sequence homology suggests that at least all group V and group VI grass-pollen allergens belong to this new class of `four-helix-bundle allergens'.

Allergic diseases are increasing worldwide and impose a huge burden on westernized societies. The physiological as well as the structural mechanism of allergy is deeply complex and the individual steps of molecular recognition are understood only very preliminarily (Rouvinen et al., 1999; Suphioglu et al., 1997). Allergies are induced by various compounds de®ned as allergens and once patients produce speci®c immunglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against these molecules they are sensitized. This situation is characterized by a predominance of T-helper 2 cells (Th2), mainly producing various cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 (Suphioglu et al., 1997; Burney et al., 1997; Beasley, 1998; Vercelli et al., 1998; Romagnani, 1997). IL-4 is the most prominent of these cytokines promoting IgE production. Effector cells (i.e. mast cells) in the mucosa or skin are coated with these IgE antibodies via high-af®nity Fc receptors and are thus prepared to encounter the allergen. If this occurs and if at least two IgE antibodies are crosslinked via epitopes on the surface of the allergen, a release of mediators is induced, leading ultimately to the allergic in¯ammation (Sutton & Gould, 1993). About half of all allergic patients are sensitized towards grass-pollen proteins. Phlp 5b (derived from Phleum pratense, timothy grass) is one of the most relevant of these molecules and causes allergies in the majority of sensitized patients (Wissenbach et al., 1998). No speci®c features of these molecules have been identi®ed so far that explain why these pollen-protein molecules induce an allergic in¯ammatory response. While considerable knowledge of the primary structures of allergens has been gathered, analysis of their three-dimensional structures has started only recently with the application of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Today, several three-dimensional structures of allergenic molecules have been published: they were determined by comparative modelling (Baur et al., 1986; Topham et al., 1994), by NMR

(Metzler et al., 1992; Faber et al., 1996; Ichikawa et al., 1998,), by X-ray crystallography (Rouvinen et al., 1999; Fedorov, Ball, Mahoney et al., 1997; Fedorov, Ball, Valenta et al., 1997; Thorn et al., 1997; Bocskei et al., 1992; Brownlow et al., 1997; Lascombe et al., 2000; Mirza et al., 2000) and by combined NMR and X-ray crystallography (Gajhede et al., 1996; Faber et al., 1996). Although a predominant -sheet content is noticeable in the published structures (Rouvinen et al., 1999), speci®c structural features explaining the allergenicity of these proteins have not been identi®ed. Nevertheless, since it is ultimately the three-dimensional structure which determines the interaction of allergen and IgE antibodies, further structural knowledge is necessary to understand the phenomenon of allergenicity. Therefore, we have applied X-ray crystallographic methods in order to determine the structure of the pollen allergen Phlp 5b. In a ®rst attempt to crystallize the entire 29 kDa allergen Phlp 5b, we observed limited proteolysis of the holoprotein to a mixture of several fragments from which one particular polypeptide preferentially crystallized (Bufe et al., 1996). It was identi®ed as a 13 kDa C-terminal fragment, here termed [Phlp 5b]H , which turned out to possess the full allergenic activity of the parental Phlp 5b. The observation that a similar fragment is produced from Phlp 5b in the presence of human mucosa (Bufe et al., 1998) leads to the conclusion that it represents the biologically and clinically important domain of the major grass-pollen allergen Phlp 5b.

2. Material and methods
Recombinant [Phlp 5b]H was cloned, expressed and puri®ed as described in Bufe et al. (1996). Crystals were grown using the vapour-diffusion technique by mixing 2 ml of the protein solution at a concentration of 6 mg mlÀ1 and 2 ml of 1.6 M phosphate pH 4.0 containing 0.5 mM MgCl2/0.1 mM ATP as a precipitant. Orthorhombic crystals with dimensions of 0.2 Â 0.2 Â 0.4 mm grew within 5 d at 295 K. Analysis of crystals by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI±MS) of allergen samples was performed using a Bruker-Re¯ex III instrument (Bruker±Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in linear TOF con®guration at an acceleration voltage of 20 kV and with delayed ion extraction. [Phlp 5b]H was dissolved in water at a concentration of 7 mg mlÀ1, further diluted in the ratio 1:60 with a freshly prepared matrix solution [saturated 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (sinapic, SA; Aldrich) in a 2:1 mixture of 0.1% tri¯uoroacetic acid/acetonitrile]. 0.5 ml aliquots were deposited on a metallic sample holder and analyzed immediately after drying in a stream of air. Massscale calibration was performed internally by adding the appropriate amounts of insulin and cytochrome c (Sigma). Three crystals were washed with 2 M ammonium sulfate pH 4 and redissolved in 200 ml water; a 10 ml aliquot mixed with matrix solution in a ratio of 1:9 was further treated as described before. Native diffraction data to high resolution were collected using synchrotron radiation at beamline BW6 (DESY, Hamburg) equipped with a MAR image-plate scanner and

applying cryoconditions using 22% ethylene glycol in the mother liquor as cryoprotectant. The images were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The space group was assigned to be C2221, with unitÊ cell parameters a = 38.97, b = 50.36, c = 107.80 A and one molecule of [Phlp 5b]H in the asymmetric unit. The calculated Ê Matthews coef®cient (Matthews, 1968) is 2.24 A3 DaÀ1, which corresponds to a solvent-volume fraction of approximately 50%. The data-collection and re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 1. One heavy-atom derivative was prepared by soaking native crystals of [Phlp 5b]H for 36 h at 289 K in a 1 mM HgCl2 solution containing 2 M phosphate Ê buffer pH 4.5. Derivative data to 3.0 A were collected using a Rigaku rotating-anode generator equipped with a MAR image plate and processed accordingly. The CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) was used for most calculations. One major site and two minor sites were identi®ed by the difference Patterson methods and three additional minor sites were located in the difference Ê Fourier maps. Heavy-atom parameters were re®ned to 3.8 A

using the program MLPHARE (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The application of anomalous data from the mercury derivative complemented the phasing procedure. The backbone of the molecule was initially traced using solvent-¯attened and phase-extended electron density (Cowtan, 1994). Phases calculated from the ®rst model were combined with SIRAS phases. The resulting combined electron-density map exhibited density even for some of the bulky hydrophobic side chains; most of the side chains were modelled at this stage. Cycles of phase-combination model building and re®nement resulted in the ®nal model. This È model was further re®ned using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992). All Ê (except the Rfree set) were used for data in the range 27±1.98 A the re®nement without a '-cutoff. Bulk-solvent correction was applied. The ®nal model of [Phlp 5b]H consists of 102 aminoacid residues and 97 water molecules. According to the electron density, one water molecule was reassigned as an Mg2+, which was an ingredient of the precipitant solution, and one partially occupied phosphate group was identi®ed. All residues have well de®ned electron density, as shown for example in Fig. 1, except the side chains of the three glutamines 145, 204 and 240. The N-terminal residue Lys138 is disordered. The ®nal R factors are R = 19.7% and Rfree = 24.1%, respectively. The model is characterized by stereochemical parameters well within acceptable ranges as analyzed by the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). All residues fall into the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. (Fig. 2a). The four helices, labelled A, B, C and D, are composed of residues 152±173, 177±195, 207±220 and 225±240, respectively (residue numbering according to PubMed Protein Database entry Q40963, 15 July 1999). Helices A and B are more amphiphilic than the other two. Helix A is bent at the N-terminal part and helix D is slightly extended. The fourhelical bundle is characterized by inter-helical angles of 143 (A±B), 170 (B±C), 149 (C±D) and À148 (A±D), respectively, calculated using the program HELIXANG (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The helices are connected by short linker segments 174±176 (AB linker), 196±206 (BC linker) and 221±224 (CD linker). The AB and CD linkers are composed of tight turns. The BC linker is

expanded and involves an incipient helical conformation for residues 202±204. The curvature of helix A is $40 at the N-terminus. It is caused by a slight deviation from ideal -helical values of the backbone dihedral angles of residues Glu154, Ilel58 and Asp159 and by the interference of solvent waters with the typical hydrogen-bond structure. Helix B has the largest buried hydrophobic surface of the four. Furthermore, this helix is terminated by the so called `Schellman motif', which is found to be a frequent mode of helix termination in proteins and synthetic peptides (Schellman, 1980). Gly197 adopts right-handed -helical dihedral angles which favour the formation of the Schellman motif. Overall, the helical bundle buries 13 residues, forming a hydrophobic core. The residues involved in the core are Ile158, Ile161, Phe165, Phe181, Phe184, Phe188, Ile192, Ile206, Leu209, Val213, Phe232, Leu236 and Ile240. As expected, no polar or charged residues are buried in this region. This type of fold is different from all other allergen structures determined so far (Rouvinen et al., 1999; Metzler et al., 1992; Ichikawa et al., 1998; Fedorov et al., 1997; Gajhede et al., 1996) and also different from those observed in numerous other four-helix-bundle proteins such as phospholipase C and several cytokines. A topology similar to that of Phlp 5b is found for cytochrome cH which, following the taxonomy of Harris et al. (1994), is classi®ed as a `square bundle'. As shown in Figs. 2(b) and 3, the protein forms a stable dimer with a crystallographically twofold-related molecule which can be expected to be the stable physiologically active form. The dimer is stabilized by one intermolecular disul®de bridge between the twofold-related Cys205 residues and by ten intermolecular hydrogen bonds, including four bonds mediated through water molecules. The dimer is additionally stabilized by the aromatic interaction between symmetryrelated Tyr200 residues. It appears that the disul®de bridge is compulsory for the stabilization of the dimer. Upon dimer Ê formation, a surface area of approximately 420 A2 of each monomer is buried, which is $10% of the total accessible surface area of the monomer. Although [Phlp 5b]H has been expressed as a protein corresponding to the C-terminal 136 amino-acid residues of the holo-allergen, starting at Lys149, the crystal structure contains only 102 residues, ending at Ile240. In order to decide whether the lack of electron density for 33 amino acids at the C-terminus was a consequence of disorder of the structure or of the absence of this part of the polypeptide in the crystal, single crystals were dissolved in water and subjected to mass spectrometry. The mass spectrum of the protein preparation prior to crystallization showed two peaks at 13 401 and 26 798 Da, respectively, corresponding to the monomer and the dimer. The sample derived from the crystal showed peaks at 11 840 and 23 680 Da (data not shown). Obviously, a C-terminal truncation has occurred during the crystal-growth experiment, indicating another site of limited proteolysis in the allergen molecule. This is in accordance with electrophoretic data that allergen preparations contain such small fragments after prolonged storage. Whether the allergen Phlp 5b is truncated in an autoproteolytic reaction or owing to a putative contamination with proteases is not clear at present; the phenomenon is at least reproducible, since different preparations of the protein behave in the same way. The fact that the mass spectrum of the redissolved crystal shows mainly the dimer peak, in contrast to the starting preparation which shows monomer and dimer in comparable amounts, indicates that not only C-terminal truncation but also dimer formation precede crystal growth. To exclude the possibility that the C-terminal truncation led to loss of allergenic activity, dissolved crystals were used in an in vitro bronchial provocation test on human bronchial mucosa in an ex vivo lung slices culture. Compared with the parental Phlp 5b, the C-terminal truncated allergen induced signi®cant obstruction of the small airways, indicating a speci®c IgE-mediated reaction of the mucosa (data not shown). When performing a self-sequence comparison of [Phlp 5b]H it turned out that two stretches of 35 residues with 46% sequence identity could be aligned (Fig. 4a). This sequence homology is also re¯ected in the three-dimensional structure, where each sequence stretch forms a helix±turn±helix motif. The three-dimensional homology of both stretches is further Ê demonstrated by an r.m.s. deviation of 0.8 A for superposition of 35 C atoms as shown in Fig. 4(b). Also, the molecular interactions expressing helix termination and chain reversal in these helix±turn±helix motifs are remarkably similar. One example is illustrated in Fig. 5. The NZ atoms of Lys180 and Lys228 from the second helix interfere with the helix hydrogen bonds of the ®rst helix in both cases. Furthermore, Phe184 and Phe232 participate in the helix±helix packing. In addition, the presence of Pro177 and Pro225 facilitate helix termination as well as chain reversal. Finally, the solvent-accessible surface areas of the corresponding residues in the two segments is comparable overall (Fig. 4c). This kind of internal homology points to a special type of four-helix bundle topology, which can be de®ned as twinned two-helix bundle. Interestingly, this motif also seems to be present in the N-terminal part of the 29 kDa holo-allergen, which is not part of the threedimensional structure presented here. The alignment of the sequence of this portion of the molecule with that of [Phlp 5b]H for the region de®ning the helix±turn±helix motifs reveals a 60% homology (Fig. 5). Most probably, the holo-protein is assembled of two parts, each holding a four-helix-bundle structure or two helix±turn±helix motifs. Whether the holoallergen forms a two-domain structure with a helix bundle in each domain or one multi-helix bundle will be clear after the determination of the complete structure. The internal structural homology of the entire Phlp 5b molecule was con®rmed by the fact that IgE antibodies, isolated by af®nity adsorption to [Phlp 5b]H , also recognize the N-terminal portion of the holo-allergen (data not shown).

structure and it is reasonable to ask whether the structure can provide an explanation of the allergenic property of this molecule. An interpretation of allergenicity derived from three-dimensional structures has not so far been possible. The question is whether the structure of [Phlp 5b]H allows identi®cation of three-dimensional features of the IgE-binding epitopes that play a key role in evoking allergic symptoms. However, if we assign all peptide sequences known to bind IgE from various allergic patients (Schramm et al., 2001), it becomes evident in the crystal structure of [Phlp 5b]H that most parts of the allergen's surface can be potential candidates for recognition by IgE antibodies. Consequently, a common pattern for the three-dimensional architecture of IgE epitopes is not evident. A recent review of all known crystal structures of other allergens results in a similar conclusion (Rouvinen et al., 1999). Nevertheless, the crystal structure of [Phlp 5b]H points to a signi®cant property which may be important for the allergenicity of this molecule. It is the compactness of the structure that confers conformational stability and may function as a `shield' against proteolytic attack during the invasion of the allergen into the human tissue. The allergen has to overcome the proteolytic barrier of the respiratory mucosa with its conformation fully conserved before interacting with IgE antibodies. As it has turned out that IgE epitopes are mainly conformationally active, three-dimensional integrity is obviously essential for allergenicity. The presence of truncated Phlp 5b forms of about 11 kDa found in the nasal secretions of patients demonstrates that allergens are indeed subjected to proteolysis in vivo (Bufe et al., 1998). The molecule described and discussed here is obviously generated by limited proteo-

lysis of Phlp 5b in vitro. We have previously reported the preferential crystallization of a 13 kDa fragment (Bufe et al., 1996) emerging from preparations of the 29 kDa parent protein by N-terminal truncation. The three-dimensional structure presented here reveals a further C-terminal truncation, resulting in a 11 kDa core domain. Whether these degradations are caused by endogenous or by contaminating proteolytic activities is not clear, but the stability of the 11 kDa four-helix bundle is obvious. The antiparallel orientation of the helices and relatively short linker segments provide compactness, which is the structural explanation for the domain integrity and is obviously essential for the preservation and donation of IgE-binding epitopes as a prerequisite of the allergenic effect. While our data do not ultimately answer the question of what makes an antigen become an allergen, they do elucidate the minimum requirements for proteins to be allergenic. Finally, it can be proposed that allergens must contain at least one core domain which is stable towards proteolytic degradation and possesses high conformational integrity, thereby preserving the three-dimensional architecture of IgE-binding epitopes. The four-helix bundle of Phlp 5b apparently meets these requirements and survives as a compact structural unit after being truncated from the 29 kDa pollen protein and still exhibits full allergenicity (in vitro bronchial provocation test; data not shown). Thus, the four-helix bundle of Phlp 5b seems to represent the minimum possible structural unit for allergenicity. Furthermore, the structural symmetry of the homodimer and the internal sequence homology of the structural elements are probably connected with allergic effects. When comparing the other available allergen structures reported so far, it is interesting to note that all of them are composed solely or at least mainly of -structures (Rouvinen et al., 1999). In contrast, the [Phlp 5b]H structure presented here is the ®rst example of an all-helical structure and may open up a new structural class of allergens. When looking for further candidates of this class of proteins it becomes obvious that the related isoallergens known from other grass species, such as rye grass, Kentucky bluegrass, canary grass and velvet grass, show considerable sequence homology (Petersen et al., 1995; Suphioglu et al., 1997; Gehlhar et al., 1997). Therefore, it can certainly be assumed that they also contain the repetitive helix±turn±helix motif identi®ed here for the ®rst time in an allergen. In fact, it seems probable that group V and group VI grass-pollen allergens belong to this new class of allergens characterized by protease-resistant four-helixbundle domains.

Figure 5

Self-sequence comparison of the entire Phlp 5b holoprotein. The holoprotein is made up of 284 amino acids, with two segments (blue regions; 1 and 2) showing a sequence homology of $60%. The [Phlp 5b]H four-helix-bundle structure corresponds to the C-terminal part of the holoprotein. The four helices representing this part are indicated schematically in bold. The sequence homology suggests that the Nterminal part also adopts a four-helix-bundle topology, indicated by dotted lines. The corresponding sequence alignment is shown below.
