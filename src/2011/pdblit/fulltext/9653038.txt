The crystal structure of the ternary complex of hexameric purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) from Escherichia coli with formycin A derivaÊ tives and phosphate or sulphate ions is determined at 2.0 A resolution. The hexamer is found as a trimer of unsymmetric dimers, which are formed by pairs of monomers with active sites in different conformations. The conformational difference stems from a ¯exible helix (H8: 214-236), which is continuous in one conformer, and segmented in the other. With the continuous helix, the entry into the active site pocket is wide open, and the ligands are bound only loosely (``open'' or ``loose binding'' conformation). By segmentation of the helix (H8: 214-219 and H8H : 223-236, separated by a g-turn), the entry into the active site is partially closed, the pocket is narrowed and the ligands are bound much more tightly (``closed'' or ``tight binding'' conformation). Furthermore, the side-chain of Arg217 is carried by the moving helix into the active site. This residue, conserved in all homologous PNPs, plays an important role in the proposed catalytic mechanism. In this mechanism, substrate binding takes place in the open, and and the catalytic action occurs in the closed conformation. Catalytic action involves protonation of the purine base at position N7 by the side-chain of Asp204, which is initially in the acid form. The proton transfer is triggered by the Arg217 side-chain which is moved by the conformation change into hydrogen bond distance to Asp204. The mechanism explains the broad speci®city of E. coli PNP, which allows 6-amino as well as 6-oxo-nucleosides as substrates. The observation of two kinds of binding sites is fully in line with solution experiments which independently observe strong and weak binding sites for phosphate as well as for the nucleoside inhibitor.

The enzyme catalyses the reversible phosphorolytic cleavage of the glycosidic bond of purine nucleosides and some analogues:

There are two main classes of PNPs. ``Low-molecular mass'' (Mr $90 kDa) homotrimeric enzymes are found mainly in mammals and accept only 6-oxopurine nucleosides as substrates. ``Highmolecular mass'' (Mr $110-150 kDa) homohexameric enzymes occur in various microorganisms

352 and have a broader speci®city by accepting also 6aminopurine nucleosides. These classes show almost no sequence homology, and differ substantially in the architecture of the active site.3 The details of the catalytic mechanism have not been explored, but for trimeric PNPs, there is consensus that it involves a transition state forming an oxocarbenium ion as shown in Scheme 1 for the

In the crystal structure of the native enzyme,17 all six molecules have similar conformation and the hexamer represents a trimer of symmetrical dimers.

example of inosine.4 Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the transition state is stabilized, such as protonation at position N7 to withdraw electrons from the scissile bond N9-C1H (Scheme 1), whereas others involve a negatively charged purine base and proton loss of the phosphate ion.4 ± 11 For high-molecular mass PNPs, the catalytic mechanism is as yet unknown. For a number of fundamental and practical reasons, considerable attention is devoted to PNPs isolated from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources.3 For example, potent inhibitors of human and parasitic PNPs are potential chemotherapeutic agents. Non-speci®c bacterial phosphorylases are useful tools for enzymatic synthesis of purine nucleosides, including some with chemotherapeutic activity. Recently, Escherichia coli PNP was shown to be a promising candidate for tumordirected gene therapy. Also for human PNP, structural studies are available.12,13 With several substrates, PNPs show complicated non-Michaelis kinetic behaviour pointing to possible cooperativity between subunits or non-identity of active sites. For the hexameric E. coli PNP, kinetic data may be interpreted as cooperative binding of phosphate to the enzyme,14,15 and quenching of enzyme ¯uorescence by phosphate indicates two different phosphate binding sites (or two conformations of the enzyme) with dissociation constants of 29.4 mM and 1.12 mM, respectively.16 Since only

phate/sulphate, E. coli PNP crystallizes in a hexagonal space group where crystal symmetry forces one of the three dimers to be symmetrical (with disordered C-terminal part), whereas the other two are unsymmetric.18 Therefore, differences between phosphate binding sites and the possible mechanism of cooperative binding of phosphate could not be interpreted unequivocally. Here, we present a new crystal form of E. coli PNP as found for a ternary complex with formycin A derivatives and phosphate or sulphate. In the asymmetric unit, there is a full hexamer built as a trimer of unsymmetrical dimers. Moreover, each monomer of the dimer binds selectively a different formycin A derivative.

Results and Discussion
Solution studies Inhibitory properties and tautomerism of formycins The formycins are a class of PNP inhibitors which are close structural analogues of the natural substrates, with 8-aza-9-deazapurine instead of purine bases, and a base-ribose C-C bond that cannot be cleaved by the enzyme (Scheme 2). Note that IUPAC ring numbering is different for the two ring systems. Unlike the substrates adenosine and gianosine, the formycins occur in solution as a mixture of tautomeric forms. Formycins A and B,

in particular, exist in two tautomeric forms with populations of about 85 % for N1-H and 15 % for N2-H, respectively.19 The best inhibitor of E. coli PNP known as yet is 6-methylformycin A, with Kapp  0.3 mM at neutral i pH.20 In aqueous solution, this compound undergoes rearrangement to four different formycin derivatives as shown in Scheme 3; relevant chemical structures are shown in Schemes 2 and 4.21 The main product, N7-methylformycin A, is formed by Dimroth rearrangement (Scheme 5). For 6-methylformycin A, there are one amino and two imino tautomers; in aqueous medium, the amino and imino forms occur in comparable populations, whereas in low-polar solvents the imino form predominates.20 ± 22 In theory, N7-methylformycin A may occur in three amino and two imino forms, but this has not been studied experimentally. Since the pK value of this analogue is 4.6 (Table 1;

Scheme 3. Water hydrolysis of 6-methylformycin A. In the original study by Lewis & Townsend,21 three products (no formycin A) were obtained at 100  C after 24 hours. The same rearrangement is expected to occur in a crystallization procedure on a longer time-scale (see Materials and Methods).

Figure 9), i.e. similar to formycin A and lower than expected for protonation of the imino derivative, the amino forms presumably predominate. Inhibitory properties of formycins A, B and 6methylformycin A have been described,20 and those of N7-methylformycin A were determined here. The competitive inhibition of 7-methylguanosine phosphorolysis by N7-methylformycin A at pH 5.5 is shown in Figure 1, and apparent inhibition constants at pH 5.5 and 7.0 are given in Table 1 together with relevant data for the other formycin derivatives (in part with inosine as the variable substrate). Only at physiological conditions, 6-methylformycin A is an excellent inhibitor of E. coli PNP.20 Because the pK value for protonation is 7.45 and the enzyme shows marked preference for the neutral form, the inhibitory properties are critically pH-dependent. At the pH  5.5 of the present crystallization experiment (see below), only about 1 % of the inhibitor is in the neutral form and Kapp  25.2 mM (Table 1). In contrast, the pK value i for protonation of N7-methylformycin A is 4.6, and its inhibitory power is maintained even at rather low pH values (Kapp at pH 7.0 and 5.5 is 2.7 mM i and 2.2 mM, respectively; Table 1). Formycins A and B have even lower pK values for protonation, 4.3 and 0.9, respectively. In consequence, 6-methylformycin A is at neutral pH the best inhibitor of E. coli PNP, whereas at our pH of crystallization, it binds more weakly than the other formycin derivatives. All this suggests that in crystallization experiments taking several weeks of time, part of the initially used ligand 6-methylformycin A might

transform to some of the other formycin derivatives. This was actually observed, as will be described below. Furthermore, one cannot predict which of the tautomer(s) will be bound by the enzyme. Dissociation constants and binding stoichiometry of phosphate and sulphate In solution, binding of phosphate to E. coli PNP is described by two dissociation constants Kd, one for strong binding with Kd  29.4 mM and one for much weaker binding with Kd  1.12 mM, and relative populations of about 50 % each (see

Table 2). In contrast, binding of sulphate is described by only one dissociation constant, Kd  1.36 mM, similar to weak binding of phosphate.16 The crystal structure of E. coli PNP in complex with formycin B and a phosphate or sulphate ion shows only one phosphate binding site per monomer.18 In combination with the observation (in solution) of two binding sites populated 50 % each, this indicates that one enzyme hexamer possesses three strong and three weak phosphate binding sites. It must be considered, however, that the weak phosphate binding sites of the crystallized hexamer may be occupied by sulphate, which is used in

high concentrations (28-35 %) as precipitating agent in crystallization, but also by phosphate which has been in contact with the enzyme during puri®cation (see Materials and Methods). Dissociation constant and binding stoichiometry of 6-methylformycin A Binding of 6-methylformycin A to E. coli PNP was studied by monitoring the intrinsic ¯uorescence of the enzyme at different inhibitor concentrations. The experiments were conducted in the presence of phosphate or sulphate, and in Hepes buffer only. Since the enzyme binds preferentially the neutral form of 6-methylformycin A (pK  7.45),20 all titration studies were performed at pH 8.3 in which the neutral form dominates. A typical example of a ¯uorescence titration is shown in Figure 2. It is seen that strong binding of 6-methylformycin A requires the presence of phosphate, whereas in presence of sulphate or only Hepes buffer, binding is weak. For the latter cases, the dissociation constants could not even be determined because saturation was not reached at the highest ligand concentration employed, 35 mM (higher concentrations lead to unacceptably high inner ®lter effects). Dissociation constants and binding stoichiometry are obtained by ®tting equation (1) (see Materials and Methods) to titration data obtained in presence of 20 mM and 300 mM phosphate (Table 3). The dissociation constant of 6-methylformycin A in 20 mM phosphate is about 1 mM, similar to the apparent inhibition constant of the neutral form of 6-methylformycin B (Table 1). The binding stoichi-

ometry is three ligand molecules (6-methylformycin plus phosphate) per enzyme hexamer. This stoichiometry holds also for very high (300 mM) phosphate concentration (Table 3), and does not depend on the enzyme concentration (observed in the range 4.8-50 mM monomer concentration; data not shown). Thus, 6-methylformycin A may be regarded as a ``half-the-sites inhibitor'' of the E. coli PNP-phosphate complex. However, with the method employed, we cannot see if the remaining three sites do not bind 6-methylformycin A at all, or rather bind it with a much higher dissociation constant. In previous}18 and present crystallographic studies, a high surplus of inhibitor was used in the crystallization setup, and all six binding sites were found occupied. This clearly supports the second variant. Crystal structure General Catalytically active E. coli PNP consists of six monomer subunits with identical primary sequence of 238 amino acid residues.23 In the present crystal structure, the six monomers are symmetry-independent (complex with formycin A

opened above and below the equatorial plane of the hexamer, and the distance between the active Ê centers in one dimer is about 19 A. Hydrogen bond contacts between the monomers constituting a hexamer are formed in the same way as described for the native enzyme17 and the formycin B complex.18 Overall structure of unsymmetrical dimers In the hexamer shown in Figure 3, the dimers are all unsymmetric, i.e. they are formed by pairs of molecules in different conformation in such a way that monomers in open and closed conformation consecutively follow each other (closed conformation: A, B, C; open conformation: D, E, F). The monomers of different conformation bind different formycin derivatives (A, B, C bind 6methylformycin; D, E, F bind N7-methylformycin). As an example of a dimer, unit A-D is shown in Figure 4. The interface of the molecules forming a dimer buries 32 water molecules that are not connected with the bulk water (shown in red in Figure 4). Most remarkable is an elongated array of eight water molecules that connects the Arg43NZ1 donors of both active centers, but has no other contacts with active site residues. The interfaces between dimers bury much less water, eight molecules. In addition, there are about ®ve buried water molecules found inside each monomer (shown in blue in Figure 4). Open and closed conformation of E. coli PNP In the crystal structure of native E. coli PNP,17 residues 214-236 near the C terminus (238) form a long a-helix in all six monomers (H8 according to our notation,18 a7 according to Ealick and co-workers17), with high displacement parameters of the Nterminal part indicating conformational ¯exibility. In the crystal structure of the ternary complex with formycin B and phosphate/sulphate, we found two of the three symmetry-independent monomers in this conformation too, but the third exhibits a gturn at residues 220-222, separating helix H8 into two segments.18 However, since crystal symmetry and disorder problems did not allow unequivocal interpretation, we did not analyze this circumstance further. In the present crystal structure, we ®nd that one monomer of each dimer has a segmented helix H8 (H8 and H8H ), whereas the other has a continuous helix H8 with high temperature factors in the N-terminal part. Since this ¯exible section is part of the active site lining, it is of interest to have a closer look. In Figure 4, the ¯exible part of H8 is highlighted in red, and average main-chain displacement parameters are given in Table 4. Figure 5 displays the solvent-accessible surface of the active site pocket in both conformations. With a continuous helix H8, the entrance is wide open (Figure 5(a)), and the bound nucleoside is not in a very tight contact

Because E. coli PNP binds preferentially the neutral form of 6-methylformycin A (pK  7.45),20 all titration studies were performed at pH 8.3.

The overall structure of the hexamer is similar as in the previous structural studies,17,18 representing a slabshaped trimer of dimers with dimensions of about Ê Ê 100 A diameter and 60 A thickness (Figure 3). The labeling of the monomers and dimers is A-D, B-E, C-F. The monomers comprising a dimer mutually donate each other two side-chains which are necessary to complete the active site, His4 and Arg43. Therefore, the minimal catalytic unit is a dimer. The two active centers of a dimer are

with the pocket wall. Therefore, this may be called an ``open'' or a ``loose binding'' conformation of the active site (monomers D, E and F). Even with bound phosphate/sulphate and nucleoside, at least seven water molecules are present in the active site pocket. They contact the base as well as the ribose of the nucleoside, and may readily exchange with the bulk solvent through the pocket opening. If a g-turn is introduced at residues 220-222 (assignment using program24 PROMOTIF), the N-terminal segment of H8 moves in the direction of the pocket opening, blocking most of the entrance and tightening the cavity itself (Figure 5(b)). Four water molecules are displaced from the active site, one is trapped near the ribose, and only the rim of the six-membered ring of the base remains accessible

to bulk solvent. This may be called a ``closed'' or ``tight binding'' conformation of the active site. Figure 6 shows in a different projection detailed views of H8 in both conformations. In the loose binding conformation, H8 is continuous and 23 residues long (214-236) (Figure 6(a)). It is not exactly linear but has a slight kink at about residue 220, re¯ected in a widening of the regular hydrogen bonds 223 3 219 and 224 3 220 to 3.4 and Ê 3.3 A, respectively (in monomer D; mean value in Ê a-helices, 2.99 A25). The main-chain displacement parameters are roughly double for the part 214-222 compared to the C-terminal part 223-236 (Table 4), clearly showing instability of this section of H8.

H8) in direction of the active site pocket (Figure 6(b)), whereas the longer C-terminal segment, 223-236 (called H8H ) stays in the same place as before. In this movement, the axes of H8 and Ê H8H are shifted laterally by about 5.5 A, but remain roughly parallel (i.e. unlike hinge-type breaking of helices into two segments that form a kink, such as in the chaperone DnaK).26 The displacement parameters of the moving parts reduce to values similar to those for the stable segment H8H . Apart from physically narrowing the entry of the pocket and tightening the pocket lining, H8 forms two important hydrogen bonds with side-chains of the active site. The main-chain carbonyl group of Arg217 accepts a bond from Arg24Ne-H, and the

side-chain of Arg217 is shifted into the vicinity of Asp204. Both hydrogen bonds are supposed to play a role in the catalytic mechanism, which should then take place only in the tight-binding conformation (see below). The loop preceding H8 is only stretched by segmentation of H8, whereas the overall conformation is unchanged. Displacement parameters, however, indicate that this loop is more stable in the tight-binding conformation (Table 4). It is interesting to note the role of water molecules in breaking of H8. Insertion of the g-turn involves breaking of four main-chain hydrogen bonds (221 3 217 to 224 3 220), and all four are replaced by hydrogen bonds to water molecules,

part of H8 can be considered a water-lubricated sliding door that partially opens and closes the entry of the active site. To see if the conformational change is due to nucleoside or to phosphate binding, we have determined a low-resolution crystal structure of E. coli PNP with phosphate but without nucleoside inhibitor, crystallized from ammonium sulphate Ê (2.7 A resolution; our unpublished results). The structure is isomorphous to the complex with formycin B and phosphate/sulphate,18 and shows open and closed active site pockets in the same way, and all binding sites are ®lled with phosphate or sulphate ions. This shows that the discussed features of the enzyme conformation are not a consequence of nucleoside binding, but of binding of the anion. Solution studies (Figure 2 and Table 3) provide evidence that the closed or tight-binding conformation is the result of phosphate, but not of sulphate binding. Chemical identity of the bound nucleoside base Difference electron density maps of the bound inhibitors (nucleoside plus phosphate/sulphate) are shown in Figure 7 for the catalytic dimer A-D. In the monomer with tight-binding conformation, the electron density clearly represents 6-methylformycin A plus phosphate/sulphate, as expected (Figure 7(a)). In the monomer with loose-binding conformation, however, the electron density cannot be modeled as 6-methylformycin A but rather as N7-methylformycin A (Figure 7(b)), the main hydrolysis product of 6-methylformycin A (Scheme 3). This assignment of the bound inhibitor is also supported by the hydrogen bond patterns formed (see below). In monomer F, no methyl group at all

is visible at the nucleoside base, suggesting either binding of formycin A or B, which also are hydrolysis products of 6-methylformycin A, or binding of both methyl derivatives in partial occupancy. Since 6-methylformycin A was pure prior to the experiment (tested by HPLC), it must have gradually undergone Dimroth rearrangement during the complexation and crystallization experiments. Probably, 6-methylformycin A was bound to all six binding sites after setting up the experiment. In the course of the three months that passed before data collection, inhibitor present in the mother liquor experienced hydrolysis, mainly to N7-methylformycin A. At the pH used, this product has a higher af®nity for the enzyme than the starting material (Table 1), and gradually replaced the original inhibitor bound in the three monomers with open conformation. The inhibitor in the pockets with closed conformation, on the other hand, was trapped and not replaced. This clearly suggests to associate the strong nucleoside binding site with the monomers of closed (tight binding) conformation, and the weak binding site with the open (loose binding) conformation. The observation of a chemical reaction occurring in the crystalline state with the inhibitor is reminiscent of what was seen with the VX-conjugate of acetylcholinesterase, where initial X-ray data showed one conformation (non-aged), and when data were collected several months later, on the same crystal, a second conformation was seen (aged).29 Phosphate or sulphate bound? In solution, binding of phosphate to E. coli PNP is characterized by two dissociation constants of

E. coli Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase Structure

361 X-ray and solution studies combined together indicate that the anions bound in the closed and in the open conformations are phosphate and sulphate, respectively. Phosphate/sulphate binding The overall hydrogen bond arrangement involving the bound phosphate/sulphate ion is conserved within all monomers, but there are clearly different disorder properties between monomer in tight-binding and loose-binding conformation. The anion is always involved in salt bridges donated by three arginine side-chains (Arg24, Arg87, and Arg43 of the neighboring monomer), and further hydrogen bonds are formed by Gly20N, Ser90N and Ser90Og (Table 5). However, in the loose-binding conformation, the side-chain of Arg24 is poorly de®ned in the electron density map, has a vacant donor potential at Ne and is probably even disordered. This is associated with local disorder of the anion (see displacement parameters in Table 4), poor space ®lling, and clearly points to some instability of the whole

29.4 mM and 1.12 mM. Sulphate binding is described by only one dissociation constant, 1.36 mM, similar to weak binding of phosphate. During puri®cation, the enzyme has been in contact with a large excess of phosphate, certainly ®lling all binding sites. Then, the enzyme was rebuffered (see Materials and Methods), complexed with 6-methylformycin A and crystallized in the presence of 28-35 % (w/v) ammonium sulphate. We suppose that the active site in open conformation represents the weak binding site for phosphate, and phosphate bound there will be replaced by sulphate. For phosphate in the strong binding site, it is not clear whether it was replaced by sulphate or not. Unfortunately, shape, size and mass of sulphate and orthophosphate ions are almost identical and they cannot be distinguished from X-ray diffraction data at the given resolution. This means that the chemical identity of the oxoanions in the binding pocket cannot be determined with certainty from the X-ray studies alone. However, in solution, potent binding of 6-methylformycin A is observed in the presence of phosphate, but not of sulphate (see Figure 2 and Table 3). Hence, the

E. coli Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase Structure

Nucleoside binding The nucleosides in all six binding pockets have very similar conformation (Figure 7). The base is oriented high syn with respect to the glycosidic bond (C3-C1H -C2H -H2H torsion angle around 0  ). In the nucleoside substrate, this energetically unfavorable orientation of the base favors formation of the transition state (because of orbital overlap between the breaking bond N9-C1H and the bond C2H -H2H ).11 The mutual arrangement of phosphate/sulphate and ribose is also very similar in all binding pockets, and corresponds to the geometry of the proposed transition state (Scheme 1), with an O-atom of the anion at very short distance to C1H (Figure 8) Ê (between 3.14 and 3.30 A in the six monomers). This means that the conformational change of the binding pocket (from open to closed form) does not change the conformation of the bound substrate, but only leads to a change of the environment. The hydrogen bonds formed by the ribose are identical in the two conformations of the active site (Table 5). Since they correspond exactly to the binding in the formycin B complex,18 they need not be described in detail again. Binding of the base, however, is different in the two types of binding pockets (Table 5). In the following, only contacts that actually differ between the two binding sites are discussed in detail. With the open conformation binding N7-methylformycin A (Figure 8(a)), the side-chain of Asp204 is ordered (w1  61  , w2  87  ) and the two O-atoms are at hydrogen bond distance to N1 and N7 of the base. A cluster of four water molecules forms hydrogen bonds with the base, the ribose, and several active site residues. These water molecules are in contact with the bulk solvent through the widely open entry of the binding pocket. The N6 atom of the base is in hydrogen bond contact with a further group of water molecules that reach from the bulk solvent into the binding pocket. With the closed conformation binding 6-methylformycin, three of the four water molecules near the ®ve-membered ring of the base are displaced by the side-chain of Arg217 (Figure 8(b)). The remaining water molecule is buried in the active site. The guanidinium group of Arg217 is now positioned close to Asp204, whose side-chain, which is ordered in the open conformation, is now disordered over two conformations. One is very similar to that in the open binding pocket (w1  61  , w2  79  ), with the O-atoms in hydrogen bond distance to N1 and N7 of the base (Table 6, no Figure shown); a hydrogen bond to Arg217 is apparently not formed, leaving part of the Arg217 donor potential unsatis®ed. In the alternative conformation of Asp204, the hydrogen bonds with the base are broken, the side-chain is ¯ipped to torsion angles of w1  À 51  , w2  79  , and forms a pair of salt bridges with the guanidinium group of Arg217 (Table 6 and Figure 8(b)). The N7 of the base is in contact with water molecules that are connected

(a) The open or loose-binding conformation of the active site (observed in monomers D, E and F) binding a hydrolysis product of 6-methylformycin A, N7-methylformycin A.

arrangement. In the tight-binding conformation, H8 has moved in the direction of Arg24, satis®ed the Ne-H donor potential of Arg24 with a hydrogen bond Arg24Ne-H Á Á Á Arg217O, and tightened the binding pocket to improve space ®lling. This stabilizes the ¯oppy side-chain of Arg24, and Arg24 as well as the bound anion become ordered. This ordering is re¯ected in a dramatic reduction of the displacement parameters, which have an Ê average value of 16 A2 for the anions bound in monomers A, B and C, compared to the value of Ê 41 A2 of those bound in monomers D, E and F (Table 4). These observations again suggest that the three binding pockets with open conformation per hexamer represent the three weak phosphate binding sites, and the three monomers with closed conformation represent the three strong binding sites.

In monomers A, B and C, Asp204 is disordered over two conformations, in monomers D, E, F it is ordered in conformation 1. Numbering of water molecules is given in parentheses. Note the different IUPAC numbering schemes for purine nucleosides and formycins (see Scheme 2).

with the bulk solvent. Displacement parameters indicate that the nucleoside is bound more tightly than in the open conformation (mean value of 19 Ê versus 29 A2; Table 4). Possible mechanism of catalysis Various catalytic mechanisms have been proposed for different PNPs. In acid catalyzed hydrolysis of purine nucleosides (i.e. not involving an enzyme) the purine base is protonated by a suitable acid at N7 (note that N7 of the purine base corresponds to N1 of formycin derivatives in the present structure; Scheme 1).30 It was assumed that PNP activity uses an analogous mechanism,6,8 which requires positioning of an acid moiety near N7 upon substrate binding. In trimeric PNPs, no strong acid but only an Asn residue is located near N7 (Asn243 in calf and human enzymes,12,31,32 Asn246 in Cellulomonas PNP10). Therefore, it was subsequently postulated that protonation takes place by a chain of proton transfer processes from bulk water to N7 via immobilized water molecules and the Asn side-chain.11 An alternative hypothetical mechanism involves a negatively charged purine base in the transition state, stabilized by the Asn side-chain via a hydrogen bond to N7.9 Finally, in trimeric Cellulomonas PNP, Asn246 binds directly neither to N7 nor to O6 of the purine base, but only through a water molecule to O6. Therefore, it was postulated that the catalytic process involves a Glu side-chain interacting with the sixmembered ring of the purine base (Glu204; Glu201 in calf and human PNPs). This residue is highly conserved in PNPs showing sequence homology with calf and human enzymes.3 The base binding modes found in the present crystal structure allow us to draw some conclusions on the catalytic mechanism of hexameric

PNPs. However, it should be kept in mind from the beginning that formycins, in contrast to natural nucleoside substrates, show pronounced tautomerism (Schemes 2 and 4), and base binding modes for purine nucleosides and formycins may differ. Nevertheless, one may expect that for purine nucleosides bound to E. coli PNP, the N7 atom (N1 in the present structure) is probably at hydrogen bond distance to Asp204Od, which is conserved in all PNPs with sequence homology with the E. coli enzyme.3 If protonated in native E. coli PNP, Asp204 could therefore serve as the acid donating a proton to the bound nucleoside. It is not unusual that Asp and/or Glu side-chains in protein structures are found protonated under physiological conditions.33 ± 38 A neutral form of Asp204 in the free enzyme is compatible with (though not proven by) the crystal structure,17 where Asp204 is not in contact with any charged groups. In the closed conformation of the active site, Asp204Od1 and Asp204Od2 accept a pair of hydrogen bonds from Arg217, obviously implying that the side-chain is charged. If Asp204 has initially been protonated, this would suggest that proton transfer from Asp204 Od-H has taken place, triggered by the conformational change from open to closed conformation of the binding site. The catalytic mechanism for glycosidic bond cleavage in E. coli PNP would then be as follows (Scheme 6). (1) In the loose-binding conformation of the native enzyme, helix H8 is continuous and Arg217 is far away from Asp204 which can be in the acid form. The side-chain of Arg24 is ¯oppy. Phosphate and the nucleoside both can bind to this conformation of the active site, and are prealigned in a geometry corresponding to the catalytic transition state. The neutral side-chain of Asp204 donates a hydrogen bond to the purine nitrogen N7. (2) Phosphate binding stabilizes Arg24 and, in

Scheme 6. Possible catalytic mechanism of E. coli PNP involving protonation of the base at position N7. Asp204 must be in the acid form prior nucleoside binding. Note that the mechanism allows large variations at the six-membered ring of the base, whereas replacement of N7 by C-H leads to complete loss of activity. This is actually observed in experiment (the enzyme allows 6-oxo- as well as 6-aminopurine nucleosides as substrates, and even cleaves benzimidazole nucleosides, whereas it is inactive towards 7-deazapurine nucleosides).

turn, favors breaking of H8 into two segments. The active site is now in the tight-binding conformation. If the pocket is closed after binding of only a phosphate ion (and no nucleoside), it must be suf®ciently ¯oppy to open again to let the nucleoside enter. (3) The conformational change brings

the guanidinium group of Arg217 in contact with the acid group of Asp204. This triggers proton transfer to the base, followed by formation of a salt bridge between Arg217 and Asp204. The positively charged purine base leads to the ribooxocarbenium ion character of the ribose, representing the tran-

E. coli Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase Structure

365 purine ring leading to phosphorolysis of the C1H N9 bond. Open questions Despite the wealth of novel information, the present study leaves a number of open questions. One concerns the increased inhibitor strength of 6methylformycin A compared to formycin A. If bound to E. coli PNP, the relevant part of the inhibitor is exposed to solvent in both conformations of the active site, and it appears that bound formycin A and 6-methylformycin A differ only in the water interactions of the base. Since water interactions can play crucial roles in substrate recognition, such differences might actually lead to differences in the binding constants, but details cannot be derived from the crystal strcuture. There is also some variation in the hydrophobic interaction with the pocket lining (in particular with the Phe159 side-chain stacked to the inhibitor), but is not obvious why this could lead to a variation in inhibitor strength by a factor of over 10 (at pH 7; Table 1). Possibly, several small effects contribute that are dif®cult to trace individually. A second open question concerns the mechanism of cooperativity. Crystallographic as well as solution studies indicate that the two monomers in the catalytic dimer are not independent. It rather seems that only one at a time can adopt the closed or tight-binding conformation. This implies that there must be a mechanism for information transfer from one monomer to the other. No such mechanism could be derived from the present structure. The two active sites are quite far apart, and the ¯exible a-helices H8 point in opposite directions. There are no crystal contacts between hexamers that involve the ¯exible regions. The chain of eight buried water molecules that connects the Arg43 side-chains of the active sites are symmetric in their hydrogen bond contacts, and the conformation of Arg43 itself does not differ between the two pocket forms. As a further complication, it is noted that the alternate arrangement of monomers with open and closed active site within the hexamer (Figure 3) implies that there must also be information transfer between adjacent catalytic dimers. It seems that if one binding pocket is closed, this determines for all ®ve other monomers if their pockets may be (stably) closed or not.

sition state of bond cleavage in acid hydrolysis which can then proceed further. In this hypothetical mechanism, the key reaction with the enzyme is at N7 of the base. This is fully consistent with the broad speci®city of E. coli PNP towards purine nucleoside analogues, allowing large variations at the six-membered ring of the base. In particular, E. coli PNP does not only accept 6-oxo- and 6-aminopurine nucleosides as substrates (which carry reverse hydrogen bond functionalities at the 6-position), but also cleaves the benzimidazole nucleoside (which does not have any hydrogen bond functionality at the six-membered ring). On the other hand, simple replacement of inosine N7 by C-H leads to complete loss of substrate property.39 The proposed mechanism is also in line with the activity of E. coli PNP against 7-methylpurine nucleosides, which carry a positive charge on the imidazole ring. This latter feature, together with a negatively charged phosphate moiety appropriately placed close to the ribose ring, should be suf®cient for shift of electrons into the

Summary and Conclusions
The crystallographic observation of subunits in hexameric E. coli PNP with open and closed conformation of the active site explains the observation of two dissociation constants for phosphate (Kd  29.4 mM and 1.12 mM), and half-the-sites binding observed for 6-methylformycin A in solution (Kd $ 1 mM, binding stoichiometry of

366 three molecules per enzyme hexamer). The active site in closed conformation is most probably the strong binding site both for phosphate and nucleoside, and may be called a tight binding conformation. 6-Methylformycin A once bound in these sites was not replaced by hydrolysis products with better inhibitory properties (at the given pH) that became available during the crystallization process. The open conformation (loose binding conformation) represents the weaker binding site. Further evidence for much tighter binding in the closed conformation is given by the displacement parameters of the ligands located in the crystal structure (Table 4). The ligands found in closed pockets have average displacement parameters similar to Ê those of the protein main-chain (420 A2), whereas for the phosphate/sulphate ion and the nucleoside in the open conformation, the displacement parameters are about twice as high. This means that the dissociation constants observed in solution are directly mirrored in the average displacement parameters. The observed selective binding of formycin derivatives clearly supports the interpretation of tight and loose binding sites. The initially used pure inhibitor 6-methylformycin A is found in the three closed binding sites of the hexamer, whereas the open binding sites contain the hydrolysis product N7-methylformycin A. The latter apparently formed in the solvent in the period between crystallization and X-ray data collection (three months), but could replace 6-methylformycin A only from one kind of binding pocket, i.e. the open one. The conformational change leading to partial opening and closing of the active site involves introduction of a g-turn into an a-helix. This breaks the helix in two segments, one of which stays in place whereas the other moves laterally in direction of the binding pocket. The regular n 3 (n À 4) hydrogen bonds that have to be broken are replaced by hydrogen bonds of water molecules. This movement resembles a water-lubricated sliding door. The moving helix segment shifts the sidechain of Arg217 into the binding pocket, and this is probably essential for catalytic action (see below). Arg217 is conserved in all PNPs showing sequence homology with the E. coli enzyme.3 The conformational change of the enzyme does not lead to a conformational change or shifting of the ligands, suggesting that initial binding and proper alignment of the substrates occurs in the open conformation, whereas catalytic action requires the conformation to be closed. For catalytic action, a model is proposed that involves protonation of N7 of the base by the sidechain of Asp204 (Scheme 6). In this model, binding of the base occurs in the open conformation of the active site. Asp204 is initially in the acid form and donates an O-H Á Á ÁN hydrogen bond to N7 ((1) of Scheme 6). Subsequent closing of the cavity brings the guanidinium group of Arg217 in contact with Asp204 ((2) of Scheme 6) inducing proton transfer that allows formation of a salt bridge between the

E. coli Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase Structure

side-chains ((3) of Scheme 6). The protonation leads to charge ¯ow producing the ribooxocarbenium ion that represents the transition state of phosphorolytic cleavage of the C1H -N9 bond. This mechanism is fully in line with the broad speci®city of E. coli PNP, as it may operate for 6-amino as well as for 6-oxo purine nucleosides, and furthermore allows broad variations at the six-membered ring without losing activity, as is actually observed in binding studies. From solution studies we know that strong binding of 6-methylformycin A requires the presence of phosphate. This means that the conformation is stably closed only if phosphate is bound, and is in line with the observation of six open binding pockets in the native enzyme.17 However, it does not mean that the structural change is ``triggered'' by phosphate binding. Such a mechanism seems even unlikely because it would lead to immediate closing of the cavity after entry of phosphate, not allowing the nucleoside to enter as well. High displacement parameters suggest conformational ¯uctuations of the relevant region already in the free enzyme, possibly coexistence of both main conformations with the open pocket having higher population. Binding of phosphate stabilizes the closed conformation, which must still be ¯exible enough to enable the nucleoside to enter the active site. After binding of both substrates, the next closing ¯uctuation may initiate catalytic action.

Materials and Methods
Materials Partially puri®ed E. coli PNP was obtained as a gift from Dr George Koszalka (Wellcome Research Laboratories). Further puri®cation, testing of activity (using a coupled xanthine oxidase assay) and determining the protein concentration were performed as described.18,40 Three electrophoretically pure enzyme samples were used (speci®c activity 117, 90 and 42 units/mg, respectively). Crystals were obtained from the 117 units/mg sample, the other two samples were used for titration studies. The 42 units/mg sample was used to check the in¯uence of the speci®c activity on [Eact] (see below), and consequently on the apparent stoichiometry of ligand binding. Formycin A and 7-methylguanosine and butter milk xanthine oxidase (1 unit/mg) were purchased from Sigma. Spectrophotometric studies were performed on a UVVIS spectrophotometer Uvikon 930 (Kontron) equipped with a thermostated cell holder. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity plus 500 MHz spectrometer. Analytical and semipreparative HPLC was performed on a Spectra-Physics SP 8800 liquid chromatograph, using a Supelco LC-18-T (25 cm, 2 cm diameter) reversed phase column (solvent systems buffer A, 0.05 M ammonium acetate (pH 5.9); and buffer B, 75 % buffer A and 25 % (v/v) methanol). The linear gradient was 0-100 % buffer B in 20 minutes, the ¯ow rate 1.3 ml/minute, and monitoring was performed at 260 nm. Titration of intrinsic ¯uorescence of PNP with 6-methylformycin was done using a Perkin-Elmer LS-50 spectro¯uorimeter equipped with a thermostated cell holder and a stirrer for the continuous mixing of a titrated solution. For pH measure-

Synthesis of 6-methylformycin A and N7-methylformycin A 6-Methylformycin A was prepared from formycin A as described by Lewis & Townsend,21 and a sample (8 mg) was treated with water at 100  C for 24 hours. HPLC of the resulting mixture revealed four major peaks (see Scheme 3) with retention times (RT) of 10, 12, 13 and 16 (Æ0.5) minutes, and a few minor peaks of shorter RTs including a trace of unreacted 6-methylformycin A. Semipreparative HPLC allowed us to isolate all four major products, which were identi®ed after lyophylization mainly on the basis of the UV spectra,21 1H NMR spectra in 2H2O, and by comparison with the authentic samples, where available. The products with RT of 10 and 12 minutes (0.8 mg and 0.9 mg) were shown to be formycin B and formycin A, respectively. The compound with RT  13 minutes corresponded to 6-methylformycin B (0.8 mg) and the major product (2.9 mg) with RT  16 minutes was identi®ed as N7-methylformycin A.

Titration data were analyzed using the PC program Origin. Statistically signi®cant decrease in the sum of residuals, judged by the Snedecor's F-test at a 95 % signi®cance level, was used to assess the goodness of ®t. On the basis of inhibition studies, the dissociation constant of 6-methylformycin A was expected to be similar to enzyme concentration. Therefore, the following equation was used to analyze the changes of intrinsic enzyme ¯uorescence upon a total concentration of 6-methylformycin A [Lo]:  Lo  Eact  Kd   FLo   Fo À fE À fEL  2 2 2 q 1  Lo  À Eact   Kd 2  4Eact Kd À 2 where fE and fEL are the ¯uorescence coef®cients of the free protein and protein complexed with a ligand, respectively, Fo is the ¯uorescence observed in the absence of the ligand, and [Eact] is the concentration of active enzyme. This equation is valid under assumption that a single dissociation constant (Kd  [E][L]/[EL]) is suf®cient to describe the system ([L] is the free ligand concentration, [EL] is the concentration of ligand complexed with protein). In this case: Lo   L  EL 2

Inhibitory properties of N7-methylformycin A The inhibitory properties of N7-methylformycin A against E. coli PNP were tested with 7-methylguanosine as the variable substrate,39,41 in saturation of the second substrate of phosphorolysis (orthophosphate). The standard method of Kalckar42 could not be used because N7methylformycin A is an inhibitor of the xanthine oxidase used in the coupled PNP assay. Inhibition was measured at 25  C in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffers (pH 7.0 and pH 5.5). Phosphorolysis was monitored at 260 nm.41 The initial velocity of phosphorolysis was calculated by linear regression of absorbance against time. The type of inhibition and the Ki values were calculated from Dixon plots and from Lineweaver-Burk plots,43 and the mean value of the results obtained by these two methods was used as the ®nal result.

The total enzyme concentration [Eo] is the sum of the active enzyme concentration [Eact] that is responsible for changes of ¯uorescence due to binding of ligand, and the concentration of inactive enzyme that does not interact with the ligand, [Einact] (e.g. one or more subunits in an oligomeric enzyme): Eo   Eact   Einact  3

Furthermore, [Eact] is the sum of the concentration of free active enzyme [E], and the concentration of enzymeligand complex [EL]: Eact   E  EL 4

Titration of enzyme fluorescence with 6-methylformycin A Binding of 6-methylformycin A to the enzyme was monitored by recording changes in the intrinsic ¯uorescence of PNP. Fluorescence data were collected at pH 8.3 with lexc  260 nm, and emission was monitored at 300 or 320 nm (at 25  C). The path length for excitation was 4 mm and that for emission 10 mm. Protein samples for ¯uorescence measurements were prepared in 50 mM Hepes buffer (pH 8.3), and the enzyme concentration (as monomer) was $5 mM or $50 mM. Titrations of 6-methylformycin A to the enzyme solution were made from two ligand stock solutions ($100 mM and $400 mM) prepared in the same buffer, and at the same pH, as the enzyme sample. In total, at least 30 data points were obtained for each titration. Dilution did not exceed 15 %, and ¯uorescence intensity was corrected for dilution and for inner-®lter effects. Titrations were conducted in Hepes buffer only, and in the presence of phosphate buffer (pH 8.3), or ammonium sulphate at concentrations indicated in Results.

In general, the ¯uorescence intensity F(Lo) observed in a titration experiment is described as: FLo   E fE  EL fEL  Einact  finact and: Fo  Eact  fE  Einact  finact 6 5

For deriving equation (1) from equations (2)-(6), no assumptions regarding the ¯uorescence coef®cient of the inactive protein finact are necessary. Experimental data ®tted to equation (1), using non-linear regression analysis, obtaining values for three ®tted parameters: Kd, [Eact], and ( fE À fEL). The apparent stoichiometry of ligand binding to the hexameric enzyme, napp, is determined as the ratio 6[Eact]/[Eo], where [Eo] is obtained from absorption measurements. For the calculations, the extinction coef®cient of the protein e1 % nm  2.7 cmÀ1, and 280 Mr  6 Â 25.818 kDa of the hexameric enzyme, were used.23,40 To obtain the true binding stoichiometry n, [Eo] was multiplied by the factor 117/As, where As is the speci®c activity of a sample used for titration studies,

and 117 units/mg is the speci®c activity of the sample used for crystallization. This is also the maximal value of the speci®c activity observed for the E. coli PNP.18 The true binding stoichiometry was ®nally determined as n  6 Â 117 [Eact]/As [Eo]. Equation (1), with enzyme concentration [Eact] determined by an independent experiment (e.g. UV spectra, Lowry method, etc.), is widely used for analysis of ligand binding to proteins. In the present study, however, [Eact] has been obtained as a parameter of a numerical least-squares ®t. This approach allows to determine binding stoichiometries for proteins with multiple active site (under the assumption that no protein is denaturated; this assumption was checked here and, since not ful®lled, corrected as described above). The approach also allows us to perform proper analysis of binding data and to determine dissociation constants of monomeric proteins if, due to denaturation, not all protein molecules are active in ligand binding. This was shown, for example, for binding of 7-methylGpppG to the protein eIF4E.44 Crystallization E. coli PNP was puri®ed as described,18,40 using af®nity chromatography as the ®nal stage. The enzyme was removed from the af®nity column with 4 mM inosine and 50 mM phosphate buffer, washed extensively and rebuffered in 10 mM citrate, 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol.

The complex with 6-methylformycin A was formed at pH 7.0 (enzyme concentration 54 mg/ml, i.e. 2.3 mM subunits, ligand concentration 5.7 mM). It was then crystallized at 18  C following published procedures:18 precipitant 28-35 % ammonium sulphate, 4 ml of enzyme solution mixed with 2 ml of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 0.7 ml of reservoir, ®nal PNP concentration in equilibrium 108 mg/ml. Two coexisting crystal forms appeared: tetragonal bipyramids (space group P41212), and hexagonal rods (space group P6122, as in the complex with formycin B).18 In most crystallization drops, small crystals grew within a few days, whereas large specimen (dimensions up to 1 mm) appeared only after much longer periods, occasionally several months, and only in a few drops. X-ray data collection A large crystal of the tetragonal form was used for data collection (approximate dimensions 0.8 mm Â 0.8 mm Â 0.7 mm, space group P41212, Ê Ê Ê a  b  178.8 A, c  167.9 A, V  5,368,000 A3, one hexamer per asymmetric unit). X-ray diffraction data were collected at 4  C with monochromatic synchrotron radiÊ ation (l  0.90950 A) using a MAR research image plate detector at station X11 of the EMBL outstation in Hamburg/DESY. Data were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK.45,46 Measured intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes using the

E. coli Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase Structure program TRUNCATE incorporated in the CCP4 suite.47 Intensity statistics for the data set used in the re®nement are given in Table 7. Structure solution and refinement The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe,48 incorporated in the CCP4 program package.47 The complex of E. coli PNP with formycin B and sulphate in the space group P6122 (three monomers per asymmetric unit; PDB entry 1A69) served as starting model, resulting in a solution with a correlation coef®cient of 62.9 and an R-factor of 38.4 %. Re®nement was carried out using the program CNS,49 and model building was done employing O,50 using saweighted j2jFoj À jFcjj and jjFoj À jFcjj electron density maps.51 All six monomers were re®ned independently Ê while slowly extending the resolution to 2.0 A. No noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were employed. A total of 1238 water sites with good hydrogen bonding geometry were included in the model. For several amino acid side-chain atoms, the electron density was weak: Lys226 Ce, Nz of monomer B, Lys99 Cg, Cd, Ce, Nz, Glu216 Cg, Cd, Oe1, Oe2, Arg217 Cd, Ne, Cz , NZ1, NZ2, Gln218 Cg, Cd, Oe1, Ne2, Thr 219 Og1, Og2 of monomer D, Lys142 Ce, Nz, Thr213 Og1, Cg2 , Glu216 Cg, Cd, Oe1, Oe2, Arg217 Cg, Cd, Ne, Cz, NZ1, NZ2 of monomer E and Lys99 Cg, Cd, Ce, Nz , Arg101 Cg, Cd, Ne, Cz, NZ1, NZ2, Lys142 Cd, Ce, Nz , Lys226 Cd, Ce, Nz of monomer F. These atoms were not included in the ®nal coordinate set. In monomers A, B and C, all residues of the loops between S9 and H8H and between H8H and H8, and of the helix H8H (residues 206-222; notation of Koellner et al.18) are well de®ned. In monomers D, E and F, the electron density of this region is very weak, so that no side-chains could be located unambiguously, and main-chain temperature factors are relatively high. The following side-chains were re®ned in two conformations: Arg101 has two conformations in monomers A, B and C, in monomers D and E it appears rather weakly de®ned and in monomer F it is not found at all; the side-chain of Val104 exists in two distinct rotamers for monomers D, E and F; the side-chain of Met107 has two conformations throughout the whole hexamer; the side-chain of Arg135 could have two or even three conformations in monomers D, E and F, two conformations were re®ned successfully; the active site residue Asp204 occupies two conformations for the monomers with closed conformation (A, B and C). Ê At the present resolution (2.0 A), the methylation state of the inhibitors can be clearly recognized in electron density maps. 6-Methylformycin A was located unambiguously in monomers A, B and C (closed conformation), whereas N7-methylformycin A is found in monomers D and E. Only in monomer F, no methyl group could be seen at the inhibitory base. This could mean that both methylated forms (6-methyl- and N7methylformycin A) are bound and are seen as the overlay with two half-populated methyl groups, or that another hydrolysis product (formycin A) is bound. Buried water molecules were identi®ed using program Ê Pro_act,52 using a probe radius of 1.4 A. We note in passing that we have carefully analyzed the structure for possible aromatic hydrogen bonds O/N-H Á Á Á p.53 ± 55 Despite the presence of 108 aromatic acceptors in the hexamer and 3386 potential donors (1386 peptide N-H, 761 side-chain O/N-H, 1239 water molecules), we did not ®nd a single putative interaction of this type.
