A trypiophan residue at position 487 in Z.wromomzs mohilis pyruvatc drcarboxylase was altered to leucine by sitcdirccted mutagenesis. This modified Z. rtrobili.~ pyruvatc decarboxylase was active when expressed in Escfwichiu c&and had unchanged kinaics towards pyruvatc. The em/me showed a decreasti allinity For the cohclors with the half-saturating concentrations increasing from 0.64 to 9.0jtM for thiamin diphosphatc and from 4.21 to 45 PM for My". Unlike the wild-type enzyme, there was little quenching of tryptophan fluomccnse upon adding cofactors to this modified form. The data suggest that tryptophan-487 is close to the cofactor binding site but is not required absolutely for pyruvate dccarboxylase activity. SubstituGon of asparagine, threoninc or glycine for aspartate-440, a r&due which is conserved between many thinmin diphosphatedependent enzymes, completely abolishes enzyme activity.

1. INTRODUCTION Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC; EC 4.1. I .l) catalyses the dccarboxylation of pyruvatc to produce acetaldehyde and CO?, Enzyme activity is dependent on the cofactors thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) and Mg". On the basis of chemical modification studies on PDC from yeast [l] and Z~vnomwzasrttobilis (unpublished results obtained within this laboratory) it appears that one or more tryptophan residues interact directly with bound ThDP. This concept is also supported by model studies that show a direct interaction between the indole nucleus of tryptophan and ThDP [2.3]. and cofactor binding experiments on PDC apoenzyme from yeast [4] and 2, rmbitis [5] which demonstrate that tryptophan fluorescence is quenched by ThDP binding in the presence of Mg". Hawkins et al. [6] have identified a common sequence motif in a range of ThDP-dependent enzymes. This region of approximately 30 residues, which begins with the sequence glycine-aspartate-glycine and ends with a double asparagine, has been postulated to form at least part of the ThDP-binding site of these enzymes. However, none of the seven tryptophan residues of Z. rttubilt's PDC are found in this region [7]. A comparison of the
Abbreviufium:

protein sequences of PDC from Z. rmbifis 171, yeast [S] and maize [9], and the related enzyme indolepyruvate decarboxylase from Dzterubucrer cloacue [IO], identifies a conserved tryptophan residue which lies just downstream of this putative ThDP-binding motif (Fig. 1). This tryptophan residue is located at position 487 in the sequence of Z. rrtobitisPDC (numbering as in f7] but starting with the initiating methionine) and is the only tryptophan conserved across all four enzymes. On the basis of this homology and the evidence for the role of tryptophan in cofactor binding it was decided to determine the importance of this tryptophan residue by altering it to a leucine residue in PDC from 2. ntobilis using site-directed mutagenesis. The kinetic properties of mutant and wild-type Z. ntobilis PDC expressed in Esclzericltiacofi were then compared to establish the effects of this substitution. Three other mutants, in which the conserved aspartate at the N-terminal end of the ThDP-binding motif was changed to asparagine, threonine or glycinc were also prepared and characterised. 2.

ultcrntions of the Z. rtrohiiis pric gene were performed according to the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis procedure (Promega Carp,). The procedure was based on the use of a single-stranded DNA template and two primers, one of which was designed to introduce the desired mutation into the PDC coding sequence. while the other corrects a defective ampicillin resistance gene for selection purposes [l2-141. The I.8 kb DNA fragment used for mutagenesis which contains the Z. tfrd~ih jxtc gene was identical lo that obtained from a ArllEcoRl double digest of pZAN3A [IS]. The codon changes for alteration of tryptophttn (TGG) to leucine (TTG) and aspartate (GAT) to asparayine (AAT). threonine (ACT) or glycine (GGT) were confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing [16]. The mutant and wild-type Z. trwbili.s pdc genes were then cloned into the fW/EcoRI site of pUC18. where expression was under control of the lot promoter. before transformation into E, colt' strain DHSa.

All protein determinations were performed according IO the m*thod of Smith et al. [I71 using a bicinchoninic acid protein determ<nation kit (Sigma Chcm. Co.), The ThDP contcni of purified PDC was nlcdsured as described previousiy [IS]. PDC activity WBSassayed by measuring the rate of production of acetaldehyde, determined by mcasurinp the oxidation of NADH in the prescncc of nlcohol dehydrogcnase (ADH). The rate of change of absorbance at 340 nm and 30°C. in 50 mM Mes-KOH. pH G-5, was recorded. Unless otherwise stated, final 2 ml assay mixtures contained 5 mM M&Cl,, 0.1 mM ThDP, 0. I5 mM NADI-I, 10 units/ml of ADH and IO mM pyruvatc. One unit of activity is defined as the quantity of enzyme that catalyses the formation of I prnol of product/min.

Recombinant E. cofi' cells were grown at 37°C with agitation in a medium containing I .6% (w/v) bacto.tryptone, I % (w/v) bacto-yeast extract and 0.5% (w/v) NaCI. Ampicillin (50ydml) was used to select transformants of E. co/i and PDC expression was induced by addition of I mhl isopropyl-&D-lhiogalactopyranoside and E. mli cells were harvested and lysed as described previously [S]. PDC was puritied using a one-step hydroxylaputiie batch procedure [5]. Prior to storage at -3OOC in 50% (v/v) glycerol. phosphate was removed by dialysis against 50 mM Mcs/KOH, pH 6.5 which also contained 0.1 mM ThDP, 5 mM Mg?* and I mM dithiothreitol.

For preparation of cofactor-free apocnzyme. PDC obtained directly from purification (2 mg/ml; IO ml vol.) was diluted IO-fold with 50 mM Tris-HCI. pH 8.5. which also contained I mM EDTA. After I h incubation at room temperature the solution was rcconcentratcd by ultrafiltration to a IO ml volume. This was then passed through a column of Sephadex G-25 (dimensions 5.3 cd x 28 cm) equilibrated with the Tris/EDTA buffer and men through a similar column cquilibrated with 50 mM Mes-KOH, pH G.5; the apoenzymc preparation was stored at 4°C. This pH 6.5 Mes burkr. as well as the ThDP solutions used for assay and binding studies of apocnzyme. were passed through a column of Chelcx 100 cation exchange resin (Na' form) to remove divalent metals.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Substitution of leucinc for tryptophan-487 yields a mutant PDC which is active when expressed in E. cofi. Comparison of the kinetic properties of this mutant (PDC W487L) and wild-type 2. mobilis PDC expressed in E. co/i shows that this substitution affects cofactor binding (Fig. 2; Table I). The affmity of PDC W487L apoenzyme for both cofactors is decreased significantly as seen by a IO-15fold increase in the half-saturating concentrations (K,,,) of either cofactor (Table I). In addition, the Hill coefficient for each cofactor is decreased. For ThDP the value decreases from 1.46 to 0.92 which indicates that binding is no longer cooperative while for Mg+ the value decreases from 1.30 to 0.63, a change from positive to negative cooperativity (Table I). In contrast, there is little or no effect on the binding of pyruvate (Fig. 3; Table I) which indicates that alteration of tryptophan-487 has not grossly disturbed the active site. Addition of saturating cofactors (0.1 mM ThDP and 5 mM Mg?`) to PDC W487L apocnzyme was found to have little effect on tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 4). In contrast, wild-type PDC apoenzyme showed an appreciable decrease in tryptophan fluorescence upon addition of saturating cofactors (Fig. 4). Tryptophan-487 must therefore be close to or part of the cofactor binding site since cofactor quenching of tryptophan fluorescence observed with wild-type PDC is not apparent in PDC W487L. This conserved tryptophan residue must therefore be the tryptophan whose fluorescence has been shown previously to be quenched by cofactor binding to PDC apoenzyme from 2. mobilis [S] and, by homology, from yeast [4]. The mutation of aapartate-440 to asparaginc, threonine or glycine yielded proteins (PDC D44ON, PDC D440T or PDC D44OG. respectively} which were deI

2.5. M~sIII~~c~~ of cuficror birdhg The kinetics ofaclivaiion by cofactors were determined by prcincubating apocnryme with various cofactor combinations for 15 min al 30°C prior to inikttion of assay by addition of a pyruvarclNADH/ ADH mixkue. The time course for cofactor binding LO PDC apoenzymc was dclermined by following the quenching oflryplophun fluorescence. Measurements were done on an Aminco SPF 500 spectrofluorimeler wilh an excitation wavelcnglh of 300 nm (bandwidlh 5 nm) and an emission wavelength of 340 nm (bandwidth 5 nm). This unusually high excitation wavelength was chosen so as to avoid excessive absorplion of the incident light by ThDP. Reactions were performed at 30°C and inilialed by addition of apoenzyme (0.09 mdml) to a mixture oTO.1 mM ThDP and 5 mM Mg!* in 50 mM Mes-KOH, pH 6.5. 2,G.

binding to PDC but since PDC W487L apoenzyme is still capable of binding cofactors, though with a reduced affinity, then substitution with leucine is not sufficient to destroy the cofactor binding site of Z. mobilis PDC. ThDP must still be accommodated into the hydrophobic binding site and, if the proposed interaction of ThDP with tryptophan has been removed, then it is still likely that ThDP is bound to PDC by other groups on the enzyme. These residues may interact directly with the pyrophosphate group of ThDP or indirectly through Mg".

void of activity. However, the structure of none of these appeared to be grossly perturbed as they purified normally. None of these proteins was capable of binding ThDP, as judged by the fact that none contained any ThDP when isolated and none showed the characteristic quenching of tryptophan fluorescence upon addition of cofactors. These results confirm the importance of the conserved aspartate identified by Hawkins et al. [6] and are consistent with their proposal that this residue forms part of the ThDP-binding site. The fact that the binding of both ThDP and Mg" has been affected in PDC W487L is most likely due to the expected close interaction of the cofactors at the cofactor binding site of PDC. This is supported by previous observations on cofactor binding to Z. mobilis PDC apoenzyme [5] which shows that the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence occurs both with limiting ThDP and Mg?' when the other cofactor is saturating. Therefore alteration of tryptophan-487 would be expected to affect both ThDP and Mg2+ binding. Clearly tryptophan-487 plays some role in cofactor
