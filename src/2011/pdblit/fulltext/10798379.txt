The polypeptide motif of monomeric SP-B, characterized by six Cys residues paired as disul®des and periodic hydrophobic residues, belongs to a class of `saposin-like' proteins that also includes saposins A±D, sulfated glycoprotein-I, acid sphingomyelinase, acyloxyacyl hydrolase, Entamoeba histolytica pore-forming peptides (amoebapores), plant aspartic proteases and NK-lysin (10, 13±15). SP-B, as well as other proteins of the saposin family, uniformly exhibits high levels of a-helix (13, 14, 16±19), suggesting that this motif plays a critical structural role. Based on the crystallographic structure of the related hemerythrin (13, 20) and the 2D-NMR structure of NKlysin (21), the saposin-fold is apparently characterized by amphipathic a-helices with hydrophilic residues facing the solvent, and hydrophobic side-chains forming a core stabilized by intramolecular disul®de bonds. Given the critical in vivo role of SP-B in lung function, it is of interest that numerous actions of the full-length protein on surfactant lipids are mimicked by a synthetic peptide representing the N-terminal domain of SP-B (i.e. SP-B1±25; residues 1±25; Table 1). Both SP-B and positively charged SPB1±25 increase the collapse pressure of surfactant lipid monolayers containing palmitic acid; this suggests that the cationic N-terminus of SP-B interacts with anionic lipids to remove the driving force for lipid squeeze-out from the surface ®lm (22, 23). Another indication of speci®c interactions of proteins with lipids is the insertion of the protein into monolayers at varying surface pressures. The critical insertion pressure, an index of the degree of protein association with lipid ®lms and membrane systems, is very high for both SP-B1±25 and the parent SP-B (17, 24, 25). Furthermore, full-length SP-B and SP-B1±25 each similarly induce a coexistence of buckled and ¯at monolayers when added to surfactant lipids, which may participate in the reduction of surface tension and the enhancement of respreadability of the surfactant monolayer (26). Finally, initial studies indicate that SP-B1±25 has been shown to mediate lipid±vesicle mixing (27), as does the native SP-B (10, 28, 29). In view of the likely participation of the N-terminal region of SP-B in key surfactant activities, it is important to elucidate the structure of this domain in lipid environments. Earlier theoretical analysis of the primary sequence of SP-B, using the hydrophobic moment algorithm or Chou-Fasman secondary structure predictions, suggested both a N-terminal b-turn (residues 6±9; Table 1) (30) and an a-helical segment (residues 10±22) (6, 24, 31, 32). Physical experiments on synthetic peptides based on the SP-B N-terminus have also been performed to more directly assign secondary

Surfactant protein B (SP-B) is a small (amino acid residues 1±79; Mr < 8700), lipid-associating protein found in mammalian lung surfactant (1), with a conserved antigenic structure of < 300 million years [2]. An important role for SP-B in lung function is indicated by previous ®ndings showing that mutations in the SP-B gene cause severe lung disease (3, 4); moreover, preparations containing either synthetic, full-length SP-B (5) or synthetic peptides representing N-terminal and C-terminal domains of SP-B (6) improve oxygenation and lung compliance in surfactantde®cient animal models. Synthetic or native full-length SPB exhibits substantial antimicrobial activity in vitro (7, 8), and may participate, along with lung surfactant proteins A and D, as a ®rst line of defense against pathogenic bacteria and viruses (9). SP-B is encoded on chromosome two and synthesized in type II pneumocytes (1). After being processed from the larger preproprotein (10), mature SP-B is very hydrophobic and partitions into the chloroform phase with surfactant lipids when isolated from lung lavage using the Folch et al. (11) extraction procedure. Plasma desorption mass spectral analysis of native SP-B indicates that, while the protein has no post-translational modi®cations, each SPB monomer contains three intramolecular disul®de bridges, linking Cys8 to Cys77, Cys11 to Cys71 and Cys35 to Cys46 (12). The predominate molecular species of SP-B is a disul®de-linked (through Cys48) homodimer, although variable amounts of monomer are also seen in samples isolated from lung surfactant.

mapping of secondary conformation to individual amino acids. POPG liposomes were chosen to provide a homogenous lipid environment for SP-B1±25 incorporation not only because POPG is found at relatively high levels (< 22%) in lung surfactant preparations, such as Tanaka lipids [33], but also because SP-B1±25 is cationic and associates preferentially with the anionic lipids in surfactant dispersions (22, 24, 37).

conformations. Previous circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy on SP-B1±25 in lipids or solvents that mimic membranes [e.g. methanol, tri¯uoroethanol (TFE)] indicated dominant helical content, with minor b- and disordered components (24, 33). Upon repeating these experiments with a series of truncated SP-B peptides in methanol, a structural model was developed indicating that residues 8±25 (Table 1) were largely a-helix, while residues 1±8 were primarily b-sheet and b-turn [33]. An earlier proton 2D-NMR study of the truncated peptide SP-B11±25, suspended in the membrane mimics methanol or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) similarly demonstrated a-helix for residues 14± 21 (34). However, caution must be employed in extrapolating these structural ®ndings using truncated N-terminal SP-B peptides to the corresponding conformation of SP-B1±25 in membrane lipids. Experiments using truncated peptides to localize conformations have inherent uncertainties, not only because shortened peptides may arti®cially fray at their unprotected N-terminal and C-terminal ends, but also because peptide conformations in membrane mimics (e.g. methanol, SDS) may not faithfully re¯ect structure in lipid environments. Accordingly, it is important to directly characterize the residue-speci®c conformation of SP-B1±25 in lipids using alternative methodologies. Here, we study the structure of the N-terminal SP-B1±25 peptide in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the membrane mimic hexa¯uoroisopropanol (HFIP), or the lipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) using CD and conventional

Earlier studies (24) with a SP-B1±25 variant, in which Cys8 and Cys11 were replaced with alanine residues, showed that these substitutions did not perturb either peptide±lipid binding or the secondary conformation of the peptide when bound to lipids.

In earlier studies (35, 36), cassettes of similarly C-enhanced peptides allowed local domain mapping of various secondary conformations (e.g. a-helix, b-sheet, b-turn, random). The rationale behind such experiments is that the secondary structure within a peptide usually extends over more than several adjacent residues (38).

Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of POPG in PBS (500 nmoles lipid/mL) used for CD and FTIR spectroscopic studies were prepared by extrusion through polycarbonate membrane ®lters (39). A dry lipid ®lm was hydrated with buffer-saline solution, followed by vortexing of the dispersion to form multilamellar vesicles. The suspension was freeze±thawed ®ve times, and then extruded through 100-nm pore polycarbonate ®lters (Nuclepore Corp., Pleasanton, CA, USA) ®ves times using a LipoFast device (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, ON, Canada). The size distribution of extruded unilamellar vesicles was determined by dynamic light scattering with a Microtrac 9230 UPA ultra®ne particle analyzer (Leeds and Northrup, St. Peterburg, FL, USA) (40). Extrusion through the 100-nm pore ®lters yielded a single population of POPG vesicles with a mean diameter of 95.8 nm and a standard deviation of 20.3 nm.

CD Spectroscopy

CD measurements were carried out using an AVIV 62DS spectropolarimeter (AVIV Associates), ®tted with a thermoelectric temperature controller that maintained the sample temperature at 258C (33, 41). Peptide solutions or peptide/ liposome suspensions were measured in 0.1-mm light path demountable cells scanned from 250 to 185 nm at a rate of 10 nm/min and a sample interval of 0.2 nm. The instrument was routinely calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (1 mg/mL) and a 1-mm path length cell (42), and the ellipticity expressed as the mean residue ellipticity, [H]MRE (deg cm2/dmol). Peptide sample concentrations were determined from quantitative amino acid analysis (UCLA Microsequencing Facility). The a-helical structure of SP-B peptides in solvent or lipid environments was determined from CD spectra using the following methodology.

These spectral shifts were detected by measuring FTIR spectra of the natural abundance and C-enhanced peptides in various environments (35, 36); subtle spectral shifts were also detected with difference FTIR spectra, obtained by subtracting the natural abundance spectrum from that of the isotopically enhanced peptide (35).

For the 25 amino acid sequence SP-B1±25 in POPG, the FTIR analysis in Table 3 suggests that this peptide has < 13 residues as a-helix, < 9 residues as b-conformations and < 3 residues as random structure. Deconvolution of the FTIR spectra of SP-B1±25 in either the PBS or the HFIP solvent systems indicated comparable proportions of secondary structure (Table 3). The association of SP-B1±25 with POPG liposomes was quanti®ed by recording 12C-FTIR spectra, before (not shown) and after chromatographing peptide/lipid mixtures. For POPG incubated with SP-B1±25 at an initial calculated peptide/lipid (P/L) ratio of 1:70, the (Samide)/(Sn(C5O)lipid) ratio for unchromatographed and chromatographed samples indicated . 80% peptide uptake by liposomes. These results are consistent with the relatively low solubility of the peptide in PBS buffer, and the probable strong association between this cationic, amphipathic SP-B1±25 and the anionic, polar headgroup region of POPG (see below) (33).
Isotopically enhanced

To assess the overall conformation of the N-terminal sequence of SP-B (SP-B1±25) in a variety of environments, CD spectra were recorded for peptide in an aqueous buffer, a membrane-mimic solvent or a liposome suspension. For example, Fig. 1A shows representative CD spectra of SP-B1±25 suspended in either an aqueous environment (i.e. PBS, pH 7.4) or a membrane-mimetic solvent (i.e. HFIP/H2O with 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4). The PBS and HFIP spectra in Fig. 1A each demonstrate a characteristic double minimum at 208 and 222 nm, suggesting a considerable a-helical content for SP-B1±25. The corresponding CD spectrum (Fig. 1B) of SP-B1±25 with POPG liposomes in PBS, pH 7.4, after chromatography to remove unbound peptide, similarly indicates a broad double minimum at 208 and 222 nm that is characteristic of high a-helix. It is worthwhile quantitating the SP-B1±25 conformation with further analysis of the CD spectra (Fig. 1). The percentage of a-helix conformation for the peptide was estimated according to equation 1, as described above (43). Similar elevated proportions of a-helix (i.e. 50±66%) were determined for SP-B1±25 in the respective PBS, HFIP and POPG environments (Table 3). The relatively high noise for the PBS spectrum in Fig. 1A was attributed to both the limited solubility of amphipathic peptide in aqueous medium and increased light scattering due to the formation of SP-B1±25 microaggregates. Previous ESR studies (33) of spin-labeled SP-B1±25 in PBS indicated low solubility and elevated aggregation at high peptide concentrations ($ 109 mm), similar to those used here in CD measurements (Fig. 1A). The elevated noise in the POPG spectrum (Fig. 1B) might be a consequence of enhanced light scattering due to SP-B1±25-promoted liposome aggregation (27).

SP-B1±25 in POPG liposomes

Although the above 12C-FTIR spectroscopic ®ndings indicate that SP-B1±25 is conformationally heterogeneous when bound to POPG liposomes (Fig. 3; Table 3), it is not possible using only this data to assign the secondary conformations (i.e. ahelix, b-turn, b-sheet, random) to speci®c residues. To probe local conformations within the peptide, isotopically enhanced, FTIR spectroscopy was performed with SP-B1±25 labeled with 13C-carbonyl groups at multiple sites (Table 1). For peptides incorporated into POPG liposomes, Fig. 4 shows the natural abundance, 12C-FTIR spectrum of SP-B1±25 and the isotopically enhanced, 13C-FTIR spectra of a suite of cassettelabeled SP-B1±25. There are major differences between the native and cassette-labeled SP-B1±25 spectra, which are attributed to the presence of 13C-carbonyl groups. The putative b-conformation for the N-terminal region of SP-B1±25, predicted theoretically (13, 30) and experimentally using truncated peptides (33), was tested here by comparing the FTIR spectra of native SP-B1±25 with that of SP-B1±25 (F1/ L3/I5) (Table 1). In the SP-B1±25 (F1/L3/I5) spectrum (Fig. 4A), there is a large decrease in the area 1637±1613 cm±1 corresponding to b-sheet, and a concurrent increase in the area 1600±1576 cm±1, indicating an isotopic shift of <37 cm±1 . The nature of this isotopic shift is visualized more readily in a difference FTIR spectrum, obtained by subtracting the native FTIR spectrum (dashed line in Fig. 4A) from that of the SP-B1±25 (F1/L3/I5) spectrum (solid line in Fig. 4A); the

at 1662±1645 cm±1 (Figs 3 and 6). It is of particular interest that the FTIR spectrum of SP-B1±25 (L10/A13/L14) (Fig. 4C), and also the difference FTIR spectrum (Fig. 5C), obtained by subtracting the native SP-B1±25 spectrum (Fig. 4C; dashed line) from that of SP-B1±25 (L10/A13/L14), are nearly identical to those obtained for SP-B1±25 (A8/A11) (Figs 4B and 5B). Because the SP-B1±25 (A8/A11) and SP-B1±25 (L10/ A13/L14) have overlapping 13C-enhanced amino acids, these results indicate that the a-helix extends from Cys8 until at least Leu14 (Fig. 6). The corresponding FTIR spectral results of another cassette, SP-B1±25 (I18/A20/I22), provide some evidence that the a-helix terminates at Ile22. For the SP-B1±25 (I18/ A20/I22) spectrum in Fig. 4D, the band at 1662±1645 cm±1 is reduced with respect to the native spectrum, with a new band arising concurrently at 1620±1603 cm±1, indicating an isotopic shift of 42 cm±1. The difference FTIR spectrum for SP-B1±25 (I18/A20/I22) in Fig. 5D con®rms the presence of negative and positive bands centered at 1658 and 1615 cm±1, respectively.

(Table 1). The local conformations for residues 8 and 11 of SP-B1±25 were determined by comparing the C-enhanced SP-B1±25 (A8/A11) spectrum with that of the native peptide. For the SP-B1±25 (A8/A11) spectrum in Fig. 4B, the band at 1662±1645 cm±1 corresponding to a-helix is reduced with a new band concurrently arising at 1625±1608 cm , indicating an isotopic shift of 37 cm±1.

This isotopic shift is seen more clearly in the corresponding difference FTIR spectrum (Fig. 7D), which con®rms

structure was modeled as an a-helix, except for the terminal regions (residues 1±7 and 22±25), which were modeled as b-strands using Discover software. Ten cycles of simulated annealing were performed, using a protocol published earlier (55), to explore those conformations accessible to the terminal regions and helix side-chains. Throughout the simulation, constraints were applied to the helix backbone so that the structure would remain consistent with data derived from

Using a time step of 0.5 fs, the system was equilibrated for 1000 iterations at 300 K. The temperature was then increased to 900 K in increments of 30 K over a period of 20 ps. Molecular dynamics was then carried out at 900 K for 30 ps, followed by annealing to a temperature of 300 K over 50 ps. The resulting structure was then energy minimized (52, 53) using 5000 steps, followed by 10 000 steps of conjugate gradients until the maximum derivative was , 0.001. Throughout the simulation, the backbone atoms of residues 8±22 were constrained using a force constant that Ê increased by 100 [kCal/mol 3 A2] during each heating step. A similar torsional constraint was applied to all peptide bonds to maintain them in the trans conformation. With the residue-speci®c constraints based on

Following the above argument of Ludlam et al.

The Ramachandran plot in Fig. 11 veri®es that the backbone torsion angles for all 10 conformers fell within the allowed regions. Furthermore, the Ramachandran plot indicates high levels of backbone torsion angles lying in the a-helix and b-structural zones, consistent with the structure of SP-B1±25 principally subdivided into a-helix and b-conformations (Fig. 11). The superimposed conformers capture the major structural features indicated by our

The pleiomorphism that was noted at the ends of the a-helix in Fig. 6 may be due to the lack of hydrogen bonding that occurs at N- and C-terminal caps.

Discussion
The residue-speci®c conformational model for SP-B1±25 in lipid (Figs 6 and 10), developed here using 13C-FTIR spectroscopy and molecular modeling, is broadly in agreement with previous theoretical predictions and physical measurements on the full-length (25 residue) peptide. Consistent with earlier Chou±Fasman predictions of secondary structure (30, 32), b-conformations were concentrated in the N-terminal region with an a-helix in the C-terminal domain (Figs 6 and 10). It is also important to compare the a-helical content reported here from CD spectroscopy of SP-B1±25 in POPG liposomes (Fig. 1B; Table 3) with that obtained from directed
13 13

C-FTIR spectra,

namely an a-helix (residues 8±22) capped with Pro6 and Pro23, a b-conformation at the N-terminal sequence (residues 1±6) and random structure at the C-terminus (residues 23±25). Within the helix, several alternative packing arrangements are accessible to the side-chains. It is interesting to note that, in the modeled structures of Fig. 10A, the side-chain of Tyr7 often packs against the side-chains of the i + 3 residue (Leu10), an interaction that is believed to be helix stabilizing (56). In our models, Tyr7 is the residue that appears to initiate the helix, its carbonyl group being the ®rst to participate in the helix hydrogenbonding network. The b-conformation structure for the Nterminal sequence (residues 1±6) exhibits considerable ¯exibility in Fig. 10A, evincing some ability to fold on itself as an antiparallel b-sheet. Since the a-helix was constrained as an initial condition throughout, one important limitation of this modeling exercise is that it is unable to demonstrate any fraying at the two ends of the a-helix. 340 |

FTIR spectroscopy (Figs 6 and 10B). Both CD and siteC-FTIR spectroscopic analyses indicate similar a-helical content (i.e. 53 and 60%, respectively) for SP-B1±25 in POPG liposomes. These results are of particular interest, given that CD spectroscopy used continuously hydrated peptide/liposomes, whereas ATR-FTIR spectroscopy subjected samples to a drying and rehydration step. Our ®nding of similar total a-helical content from these two techniques argues against the drying and rehydration step introducing signi®cant experimental artifacts into the 13C-FTIR spectral analysis. In agreement with this are our observations that dried and rehydrated FTIR samples possess relatively high levels of hydration. Okamura et al.

Following this approach, our FTIR samples rehydrated for 2 h indicated substantial D2O content, with an intensity ratio of 2.5 for the OD stretching band of D2O (at 2493 cm ) to that of the CH2 band of lipid (at 2925 cm±1) (spectra not shown). Also in support of our view that the drying and rehydration step does not introduce errors, Goormaghtigh et al. (58) reported no differences for FTIR spectra of selected proteins recorded either by transmission in solution or by drying and rehydration on the ATR crystal. It is also important to note that the proportions of secondary conformation determined by Fourier self-deconvolution of
12 ±1 ±1 ±1

integrated intensities of the component band are proportional to the populations of the conformational structures represented by these components. The relative percentages of secondary structures may be determined by adding the areas of all bands assigned to each of these structural elements, and then expressing the sum as a fraction of the total amide I band area (48). Since Fourier self-deconvolution assumes that the intrinsic absorption of each structural component will be similar in all peptides and proteins, Surewicz & Mantsch (48) believed that the percent conformations derived with this approach should be viewed as estimates only. Despite these uncertainties, however, good correlations were reported for a wide range of proteins between the secondary structures determined from X-ray diffraction and Fourier self-deconvolution of FTIR spectra (47, 49). Here, the percent secondary structures were assessed for SP-B1±25 in POPG liposomes using both Fourier self-deconvolution (Fig. 3; Table 3) and

observed at each end of the a-helix (i.e. a-helix and b-turn for the Cys8 position, random and b-turn for Ala20; see Fig. 6); this demonstrates some fraying of the helix at the N- and C-termini. Additional conformational ¯exibility was noted in the b-sheet of residues 1±6, from examination of the conformers determined with energy minimization (Fig. 10A). Earlier physical measurements with truncated peptides (33, 34) con®rm this overall pattern of secondary structure in SP-B1±25. For example, prior CD and conventional 12C-FTIR spectroscopy on truncated SP-B1±25 peptides (e.g. SP-B1±9 and SP-B8±25) in structure-promoting methanol, indicated elevated b-conformations in the N-terminal segment Phe1 to Cys8, with high a-helix in the C-terminal segment Cys8 to Gly25 (33). Moreover, 2D-NMR analysis of another shortened N-terminal peptide (SP-B11±25) in methanol or SDS demonstrated a-helix for residues 14±21 (34). Although these physical studies with shortened peptides support the present
13

C-FTIR analysis (see above). Although our

C-FTIR ®ndings support the use of Fourier self-deconvolu-

tion in this one instance, future comparisons should be performed on a much wider suite of proteins and peptides. Also, it should be emphasized that, unlike Fourier selfdeconvolution, site-directed secondary conformations. The residue-speci®c, conformational model for SP-B1±25 in POPG lipid (Figs 6 and 10) may be further compared with previous models based on truncated SP-B1±25 peptides in membrane-mimic environments (33, 34). The local conformations for SP-B1±25 in POPG may be summarized as follows: b-sheet (residues 1±6), a-helix (residues 8±22) and random (residues 23±25). Using difference scopy of SP-B1±25 labeled with

Peptides at an initial P/L ratio of 1:70 were added to POPG liposomes suspended in PBS, pH 7.4. Spectra were recorded at 258C on chromatographed peptide/ liposomes that were dried on the ATR and hydrated with D2O for 2 h. (A) SP-B1±25 (I18) is the solid line and native SP-B1±25 is the dashed line. The minor peak at 1618 cm±1 in the SP-B1±25 (I18) spectrum indicates an a-helix contribution for Ile18. (B) SP-B1±25 spectrum (dashed line in A) from SP-B1±25 (I18) (solid line in A). The peak at 1618 cm±1 indicates an a-helix for Ile18. (C) SP-B1±25 (A20) is the solid line and native SP-B1±25 is the dashed line. The minor peak at 1627 cm±1 in the SPB1±25 (A20) spectrum indicates a b-turn conformation for Ala20. (D) SP-B1±25 spectrum (dashed line in C) from SP-B1±25 (A20) (solid line in C). The peaks at 1627 and 1608 cm±1 (arrows) indicate that Ala20 exhibits both b-turn and random conformations; the loss of some symmetry for the negative and positive bands in (D) is attributed to a relatively high noise, which distorted the shape of the negative band.

discrepancies are attributed to the inherent uncertainties of working with truncated peptides that may fray at their unprotected N-terminal and C-terminal ends. Accurate assignment of SP-B1±25 conformations using truncated peptides requires that the fragments retain the same conformation as in the full-length peptide, and this is probably valid only as a ®rst approximation. The conformation model developed here for SP-B1±25 in POPG lipid using
13

79-residue, full-length SP-B probably assumes a `saposinfold', characterized by amphipathic a-helices forming a core stabilized by multiple intramolecular disul®de bonds (13± 15, 21). The structural homologies for SP-B and other saposins may extend beyond the overall folding pattern to the local domain elements. For example, the N-terminal segment of SP-B1±25 (residues 1±9), with multiple proline residues interspersed with hydrophobic residues, exhibits striking sequence similarities with the corresponding region of hemerythrin (13). It should be noted, then, that the Nterminal domains of SP-B1±25 (residues 1±6; Figs 6 and 10) and hemerythrin (residues 1±9) (13, 20) each form b-sheet conformations. However, X-ray crystallographic analysis of hemerythrin (20) indicates that the N-terminal domain (residues 1±9) folds as an antiparallel b-sheet, whereas molecular modeling of the corresponding N-terminal region of SP-B1±25 (residues 1±6) shows an extended b-sheet with considerable ¯exibility, but only limited ability to form an antiparallel conformation. The N-terminal segment of SPB1±25 (residues 1±9) was earlier proposed to act as a sort of

C-FTIR spectroscopy permits direct conformational mea-

surements for peptide in actual membrane lipids, whereas the above studies with truncated peptides were performed using only membrane mimics (e.g. methanol and SDS). It is worthwhile determining whether our structural motif for SP-B1±25 (Figs 6 and 10) is also represented in the corresponding domains of homologous proteins. As noted above, sequence and structural homologies indicate that the

`biochemical Velcro1,' facilitating in vivo either the aggregation of SP-B or the interactions of SP-B with surfactant protein C (SP-C) (30). The self-association of SPB molecules forms protein-rich networks in lipids that may well be critical in mediating the surfactant activity of this protein (23, 26, 59). Our structural model for SP-B1±25 (Fig. 10) raises the possibility that SP-B molecules cross-link through complementary hydrogen bonding of opposing N-terminal segments, each assuming an extended b-sheet conformation. The a-helix observed here for SP-B1±25 (residues 8±22) (Figs 6 and 10) is probably a ubiquitous feature in the Nterminal region of proteins sharing the `saposin-fold.' The 3D structure of NK-lysin has been elucidated in a recent 2DNMR study, and established an overall saposin folding pattern for the soluble protein (21). Based on the known sequence 344 |

similarities between SP-B and NK-lysin and the 2D-NMR spectral ®nding of an a-helix for the N-terminus (residues 3± 18) of NK-lysin, Liepinsh et al. (21) predicted that residues 7± 22 of SP-B would also assume an a-helical conformation. Our experimental 13C-FTIR results indicating a-helix for residues 8±22 of SP-B1±25 (Figs 6 and 10) provide dramatic con®rmation of this prediction and further suggest a-helical conformations for the corresponding N-terminal domains of other saposin proteins, such as saposins A±D, sulfated glycoprotein-I, acid sphingomyelinase, acyloxyacyl hydrolase and E. histolytica pore-forming peptides (amoebapores) (10, 13±15, 19, 21). Although the functional role of this N-terminal a-helical domain remains to be determined in other saposin proteins, prior work has established that this amphipathic a-helical motif is an important participant in the surfactant activities of SP-B1±25 (24, 25, 32).

Initial constraints were obtained from residue-speci®c structural information derived from FTIR spectroscopy of 13C-enhanced SP-B1±25 peptides suspended in POPG liposomes with PBS, pH 7.4. The dark areas represent most favored regions (A, B, L), while the light gray areas (a, b, l, p) and lightest gray areas (,a, ,b, ,l, ,p) represent additional allowed regions.

Despite the similar surfactant activities reported for SP-B1±25 and full-length SP-B (22, 23, 26, 37, 59), it is unclear whether the isolated SP-B1±25 peptide accurately represents the structure of this domain in the full-length protein (10). This problem may be addressed by repeating the 13C-FTIR experiments presented here with our
