The solution structure of DsrC, an archaeal homologue of the g subunit of dissimilatory sulfite reductase, has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. This 12.7-kDa protein from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum adopts a novel fold consisting of an orthogonal helical bundle with a b hairpin along one side. A portion of the structure resembles the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif common in transcriptional regulator proteins. The protein contains two disulfide bonds but remains folded following reduction of the disulfides. DsrC proteins from

organisms other than Pyrobaculum species do not contain these disulfide bonds. A conserved cysteine next to the C-terminus, which is not involved in the disulfide bonds, is located on a seven-residue C-terminal arm that is not part of the globular protein and is likely to dynamically sample more than one conformation. Keywords: dissimilatory sulfite reductase; DsrC; helix-turnhelix; NMR; Pyrobaculum aerophilum.

Dissimilatory sulfite reductase (EC 1.8.99.1) catalyzes the reduction of sulfite (SO2 ­ ) in sulfate-reducing bacteria and 3 archaea where sulfate serves as a terminal electron acceptor in respiration [1 ­3]. This enzyme is also present in some bacteria and archaea that do not reduce sulfate but are capable of dissimilatory reduction of sulfite, thiosulfate, or trithionate [4]. It has also been identified in sulfur-oxidizing bacteria where it operates in the reverse or oxidative direction [5,6]. The enzyme is a tetramer of two a and two b subunits of 40­ 50 kDa each with some sequence similarity to one another. Most dissimilatory sulfite reductases contain two cysteinyl sulfur-linked siroheme-[4Fe24S] cofactors, along with additional iron sulfur clusters [7,8]. Dissimilatory sulfite reductase is somewhat similar to the siroheme[4Fe24S]-binding subunit (b) of assimilatory sulfite reductase in bacteria, fungi, and plants in which sulfate can serve as a source of sulfide for biosynthetic purposes [8]. Dissimilatory sulfite reductase purified from cell extracts of several Desulfovibrio species contains a third small (< 12 kDa) polypeptide, designated the g subunit of dissimilatory sulfite reductase [9]. The g subunit is tightly

bound to the a2b2 tetramer in preparations derived from Desulfovibrio vulgaris, other Desulfovibrio species, and Desulfosarcina variabilis. The complex appears to contain equimolar quantities of each of the subunits, suggesting an a2b2g2 quaternary structure [7,9,10]. Other studies have shown that in the dissimilatory sulfite reductase purified from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, the g subunit is only loosely associated with the a2b2 tetramer and becomes partially separated from it during gel filtration chromatography with a corresponding loss of capability for thiosulfate reduction upon separation [11]. A D. vulgaris culture in stationary growth phase contained an excess, presumably unbound, of the g subunit relative to a nearly constant level of a and b subunits, suggesting independent regulation of dsrC expression. Consistent with this, dsrC (also called dsvC ) was found to be located separately from the a and b subunit genes (dsrA/dsvA and dsrB/dsvB ) in the D. vulgaris genome [12]. Purification of dissociated g subunit from D. desulfuricans [11,13] revealed another small protein, d, which may be homologous to the product of the dsrD (or dsvD ) gene in D. vulgaris [12]. There is some evidence that the g/d combination retains thiosulfate reductase activity after separation from the a and b subunits [13,14]. D. vulgaris DsrD probably does not bind tightly to the a2b2 tetramer of dissimilatory sulfite reductase [15]. However, a fused DsrB ­DsrD subunit has been observed in the nonsulfate reducing bacterium Bilophila wadsworthia [16]. Dissimilatory sulfite reductases purified from two archaeal species, Archaeoglobus fulgidus and Pyrobaculum islandicum, do not contain the g subunit [3,4,17], although both organisms have a dsrC gene [4,18]. In P. islandicum the genes for the a, b, and g subunits are located with one additional gene in an apparent operon, dsrABGC [4,8]. In A. vinosum the genes for the a, b, and g subunits occur in an operon with several other genes, dsrABEFHCMK [5]. As in D. vulgaris, the dsr operon in A. fulgidus is dsrABD, with the dsrC gene located elsewhere [3,12,15,18]. Genome

Structure of P. aerophilum DsrC (Eur. J. Biochem. 268) 5843

sequencing projects have revealed a dsrC gene in nonsulfate reducing bacteria that lack dsrA and dsrB genes, but contain assimilatory sulfite reductase genes. In each of these cases, dsrC is separated within the genome from the assimilatory sulfite reductase genes, and expression of the dsrC gene in these organisms has not been reported. DsrC sequences and their homologues are shown in Fig. 1. In this report, the name DsrC is used to refer to any dsrC gene product, while g subunit refers to DsrC from Desulfovibrio species that copurifies with dissimilatory sulfite reductase. We have used NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of P. aerophilum DsrC. P. aerophilum is an aerotolerant hyperthermophilic archaeon [19] that is similar in many respects to the strictly anaerobic P. islandicum from which dissimilatory sulfite reductase, though lacking g subunit, has been purified [17]. The aminoacid sequences of DsrC from these two species are 83% identical (Fig. 1). P. islandicum does not reduce sulfate but can grow chemolithotrophically by reducing elemental sulfur or organoheterotrophically using sulfite or thiosulfate as electron acceptors [20]. The genome of P. aerophilum has been extensively sequenced [21] and was used as the basis for a structural genomics pilot project. DsrC was targeted because it was estimated to have a high probability of being a novel fold [22] and because it had some functional annotation; thus, structure determination was likely to produce new sequence ­fold information and provide a structural basis for its functional characterization. DsrC was highly expressed in E. coli and was very soluble, but failed crystallization trials, thus NMR was the technique of choice for structure determination.

Chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The dsrC gene was cloned by PCR from P. aerophilum genomic DNA using the 50 primer AGATATACATATGCCAGTGAAATGTCCCG GCGA and the 30 primer AATTCGGATCCGACGCAGC

CTGTGGGCTTCGGC. The PCR product was inserted into the Nde I and Bam HI restriction sites of a pET28b vector (Novagen) that had been modified to provide a C-terminal His6 tag immediately following the Bam HI site. Thus, the expressed protein has the sequence GSHHHHHH appended to the C-terminus of the native sequence [23]. Cells were grown at 37 8C in M9 minimal media supplemented with vitamins and minerals and 20 mg:mL21 kanamycin. Samples of DsrC labeled with < 99% 15N, < 99% 13 15 C/ N, and 10% 13C were prepared using [U-13C]glucose and/or [15N]NH4Cl as carbon and nitrogen sources in minimal media. Expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl b-D -thiogalactoside when cultures reached D600 ¼ 0.6. After induction, cultures were allowed to grow for 4­5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 25 min at 6700 g and resuspended in 25 mL lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole). Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (12.5 mg in 1 mL ethanol) was added to the suspension and it was passed three times through a French press at 10 000 p.s.i. Insoluble material was removed from the pressate by centrifugation for 12 min at 17 500 g. Protamine sulfate (12.5 mg in 1 mL lysis buffer) was added to the supernatant to precipitate nucleic acids, and the solution was clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was clarified further by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 300 000 g in a Ti90 rotor (Beckman). The ultracentrifugate was loaded on a 10 Â 1 cm Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column for purification. The column was washed at a rate of 1 mL:min21 with 60 mL lysis buffer and 60 mL wash buffer (lysis buffer with 20 mM imidazole), then bound protein was released with elution buffer (300 mM imidazole). SDS/PAGE was used to confirm that the appropriate fractions contained protein, and these fractions were concentrated to 1 mL in centricon-3 ultrafiltration devices (Millipore). Concentrated protein was exchanged into NMR buffer (25 mM phosphate pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10% D2O) with a PD-10 desalting column (Pharmacia)

and concentrated to the appropriate volume. Reduced protein was generated by exchange into buffer containing 10 ­ 25 mM dithiothreitol. For amide proton exchange measurements, NMR samples were lyophilized and redissolved in D2O. NMR spectra were recorded at 25 8C on Varian Inova 600 and 750 NMR instruments. Spectra were referenced to external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS). Twodimensional 1H­ 15N HSQC [24], HNHA [25,26], and threedimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC [24] experiments were conducted on [U-15N]DsrC. Two-dimensional 1H­ 13C HSQC [24], HMQC-J [27], and three-dimensional HNCACB [28], HNCO [28], CBCA(CO)NNH [28], CBCACOCAHA [29], HCCH-TOCSY [29], HCC-TOCSY-NNH [30], CCCTOCSY-NNH [30­32], CN-NOESY-HSQC [33] and fourdimensional CC-NOESY [34] experiments were conducted on [U-13C, U-15N]-DsrC. The sample was exchanged into D2O buffer prior to acquisition of the 4D CC-NOESY data set. NOESY experiments used mixing times of 120 ms (4D CC-NOESY and 3D CN-NOESY-HSQC) or 150 ms (15N-edited NOESY-HSQC). Spectra were processed and analyzed with FELIX (Molecular Simulations Inc.). Stereospecific assignments of Leu and Val methyl groups were obtained from analysis of their splittings in a 1H­ 13C HSQC spectrum recorded on a sample of DsrC expressed in cells grown on 90% unlabeled glucose/10% [U-13C]glucose [35]. Structures were calculated with X-PLOR 3.84 [36] using distance restraints derived from NOESY data, dihedral restraints derived from J-coupling measurements, and hydrogen bond restraints derived from amide 1HN exchange protection data. Distance restraints derived from NOESY ° data were classified as short (1.8 ­ 2.5 A ), medium ° ), medium­long (1.8­3.5 A), long (1.8­4.0 A), ° ° (1.8­3.0 A ° or very long (1.8­5.0 A) according to the estimated peak volume [37]. All restraints between pairs of side chain atoms ° were given the longest upper bound (5.0 A) except for those resulting from exceptionally intense NOESY peaks, which ° were given the second longest upper bound (4.0 A). Pseudoatom corrections were added to restraints involving ° methyl and methylene groups (11.0 A), chemical shift ° equivalent aromatic ring protons (12.0 A), and nonstereo° specifically assigned Leu and Val methyl groups (12.4 A) [37]. Dihedral angle restraints for f derived from threedimensional HNHA data were given ranges of 257 ^ 208 and 2120 ^ 408 for residues in a helices and b sheets, respectively, and 2130 ^ 508 and 257 ^ 308 for residues outside of regular secondary structure elements for which JHNHa . 8.5 Hz and , 6.5 Hz, respectively. Dihedral restraints for c were 247 ^ 208 and 135 ^ 408 for residues in a helix and b sheet regions, respectively, and were added only where NOEs, chemical shifts, and preliminary structure calculations suggested they were appropriate. Slow-exchanging backbone amide protons were identified by recording a 1H ­ 15N HSQC spectrum 1 h after addition of D2O at room temperature to a lyophilized sample of protein. ° Hydrogen bond restraints (dNO ¼ 2.8 ­ 3.3 A and ° dHN ¼ 1.8 ­2.2 A) were added for slow-exchanging amide protons where preliminary structures clearly indicated a single hydrogen bond acceptor. Embedded structures were calculated using the X -PLOR distance geometry routines DG _SUB _EMBED .INP and DG _FULL _EMBED .INP. These structures were then subjected to repeated simulated annealing

runs with DGSA .INP as new distance restraints were identified [36]. Typically, 30 000 high temperature steps at 2000 degrees and 200 000 cooling steps were used in these simulated annealing calculations. Preliminary sequence data for D. halfniense DsrC was obtained from the DOE Joint Genome Institute at http://jgi. doe.gov/. Other sequences were obtained from GenBank. CLUSTAL W [38] was used to generate multiple sequence alignments. Cartoon representations of structures were created with MOLSCRIPT [39]. Structures were analyzed with PROCHECK -NMR [40]. DALI [41,42] was used to conduct structure similarity searches. NMR chemical shifts were deposited in BioMagResBank (accession no. 5115 and 5116). An ensemble of 20 structures was deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession no. 1JI8). CD spectra were recorded in 1-mm quartz cuvettes on an AVIV 62 A DS spectropolarimeter. Protein samples were approxiamtely 10 mM . The reduced sample contained 10 mM dithiothreitol.

DsrC was produced in Escherichia coli at a yield of approximately 30 mg:L21 following purification by metal affinity chromotography and was very soluble (. 80 mg:mL21). NMR samples were approximately 2 mM (< 22 mg:mL21) and at pH 7.4 were stable for more than 6 months. No precipitation was noted across the pH range 3.0­8.0. Attempts to grow crystals of DsrC were unsuccessful. The protein construct in this structure determination had a C-terminal His-tag extension, GSHHHHHH; the possibility that this extension alters the structure from its native form cannot be ruled out. Nearly complete 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments for DsrC in the absence of reducing agents, and partial assignments for DsrC in 10 mM dithiothreitol were obtained and are tabulated (data not shown). Backbone amide 1HN and 15N resonances for residues 1, 2, 50, 106, and 108­111 were missing from 1H ­ 15N HSQC spectra. Backbone 13Ca and 13Cb resonances could not be obtained for residues 1, 2, 70, 71, and 105­ 111. 1H ­ 15N HSQC spectra of DsrC showed that upon addition of 10 mM dithiothreitol to the sample, several residues displayed changes in their amide 1 N H and 15N chemical shifts. These perturbations were concentrated in the regions of the sequence containing the cysteine residues (Fig. 2). In the sample containing 10 mM dithiothreitol, amide 1HN and 15N assignments were made by analogy, using three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESYHSQC data to assist assignment of 1H ­ 15N HSQC cross peaks that shifted substantially. This NOESY spectrum showed no changes in the identities and intensities of the peaks when compared to the same experiment recorded on the nonreduced sample. Small changes in some 1Ha and

side chain 1H chemical shifts were observed. In the dithiothreitol-free protein, 13C chemical shifts for the a and b carbons of four of the five cysteine residues in the protein (C110 is the second to last residue in the sequence and was not observed in the spectra) indicated they were not in the reduced (sufhydryl) state [43]. 13 a C and 13Cb chemical shifts for DsrC in 10 mM dithiothreitol that were obtained from a CBCA(CO)NH experiment indicated that C99 was reduced (d 13 Ca ¼ 59.4 p.p.m., d13Cb ¼ 41.6 p.p.m. without ox ox dithiothreitol; d 13 Ca ¼ 64.8 p.p.m., d13Cb ¼ red red 26.8 p.p.m. with dithiothreitol) while C22 was not reduced 13 a 13 b (d C ¼ 55.0 ^ 0.1 p.p.m., d C ¼ 38.2 ^ 0.1 p.p.m. with or without 10 mM dithiothreitol). This indicates that one disulfide bond was not reduced by the fivefold to sevenfold molar excess of dithiothreitol that was present. For DsrC in 10 mM dithiothreitol, 13Ca and 13Cb shifts for C22 and C69 could not be measured with the CBCA(CO)NNH experiment because these residues precede prolines in the sequence. Preliminary structural ensembles showed that disulfide bonds were likely between C5 and C22, and between C69 and C99. Thus, the C5­C22 disulfide bond is much more resistant to reduction with dithiothreitol than the C69 ­C99 disulfide bond. The plot of changes in amide 1HN and 15N chemical shifts following addition of 10 mM dithiothreitol to DsrC is consistent with reduction only at the C69 ­C99 disulfide bond (Fig. 2). Amide 1HN exchange following dissolution of lyophilized protein in D2O showed that the same residues exchanged slowly in samples with or without 10 mM dithiothreitol. CD spectra (data not shown) recorded on DsrC with and without a 1000-fold excess of dithiothreitol present showed similar thermal unfolding characteristics. Because this protein comes from a thermophilic organism, complete unfolding of the native state could not be observed without the addition of denaturants, so it is not possible to state whether reduction of the disulfide bonds is destabilizing. DsrC was also found to exhibit a stable low-pH form. The 1H­ 15N HSQC spectrum of a sample at pH 3.0 displayed a wide dispersion of backbone amide 1HN and 15N chemical shifts, similar to that observed at pH 7.4. Although the overall appearance of the spectrum was quite different, some of the peaks appeared to have not moved as a result of the pH change. The structure of this form was not characterized. DsrC was assayed for solute binding by recording 1H ­ 15N HSQC spectra following addition of stoichiometric excesses of solutes to the NMR sample. Sulfite, thiosulfate, and reduced glutathione were tested on both partially reduced (10 mM dithiothreitol) and nonreduced samples; no effects on backbone amide 1HN and 15N chemical shifts were observed. NOESY data collected on DsrC in the absence of dithiothreitol were used for derivation of distance constraints for structure determination. NOE data indicating secondary structure are depicted in Fig. 3A. Examples of NMR data used to stereospecifically assign Leu and Val methyl groups (Fig. 3B) and of 4D CC-NOESY data (Fig. 3C) are also shown. NOESY data suggested that one proline residue, P6, adopts the cis conformation about the preceding amide bond. This was indicated by a cross peak between C5 Ha and P6 Ha, and by the absence of cross peaks from C5 HN or G7 HN to the P6 Hd atoms. Distance and dihedral angle restraints derived as described above were used to generate a set of 24 structures.

detected by the sequence motif recognition program although it contains several common characteristics of HTH motifs, such as a glycine (G80) in the turn in a left-handed a helical conformation and a conserved hydrophobic residue (I86) in the sixth position after the glycine. The first helix in the HTH-like motif, H3, is not as well-defined by the NMR data as the other helices in DsrC. Although the NOEs and 13Ca chemical shifts observed in this portion of the sequence are indicative of a helix (Fig. 3A), 3JHNHa values measured from the HNHA experiment were on the order of 7.0­7.5 Hz compared to values less than 6.5 Hz measured for residues in other helices, and the amide protons of K77 and E78 had exchanged away completely after 1 h in D2O.

DISCUSSION
P. aerophilum DsrC adopts a novel fold, as predicted [22], consisting of an orthogonal helical bundle with a b hairpin appended to one end. The fold is reminiscent of the globin fold and some small cytochrome structures where helices are positioned almost perpendicular to one another. However, no proteins with globally similar folds were identifed by DALI . Two disulfide bonds, at C5 ­C22 and C69 ­C99, form readily in the absence of reducing agent. The structure contains a HTH-like structural motif consisting of H3, H4 and the turn between them that could not be predicted from the amino-acid sequence. This motif hints of involvement in DNA binding, but further work is required to ascertain such a role. A C-terminal arm, consisting of the last seven residues of the sequence, protrudes from the middle of the structure and appears to be more disordered than the rest of the protein. While a structure-disrupting effect arising from the His tag that is appended to the C-terminus cannot be ruled out, the most likely explanation is that the native C-terminal arm is indeed less structured than the rest of the protein. The His tag should not be protonated in the pH 7.4 buffer at which the NMR data for structure determination were collected. Proton spectra collected in buffers as low as pH 5.1, in which the His tag is protonated and more likely to have an effect, if any, on the structure, were unchanged with the exception of the usual small pH effects on chemical shifts. Also, the presence of the His tag does not lower the melting temperature of the protein to a temperature , 95 8C, suggesting that it does not disrupt a C-terminal segment that is an integral part of the folded native protein and necessary for its stability. The C69 ­C99 disulfide links an extended segment between H2 and H3 to H5 and is easily reduced in a 10-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol. NOESY spectra of DsrC with and without dithiothreitol show that the protein is similarly structured in both cases. However, upon reduction, subtle changes probably occur in the conformations and packing arrangements of nearby side chains. The resulting perturbation of electronic environments could account for the observed chemical shift changes. The changes in backbone amide 1HN and 15N chemical shifts are greater near C69, which is not part of a regular secondary structure element, and smaller near C99, which is in the middle of a helix (H5). The C5­C22 disulfide bond connects the N-terminal end of B1 to a loop following B2 and requires more than a 25-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol for

From these, a final ensemble of 20 structures was selected on the basis of lowest total energy. Structural statistics are collected in Table 1. The secondary structure (Fig. 1, Fig. 3) consists of a N-terminal b hairpin (B1 and B2) followed by five a helices (H1 through H5). The b hairpin lies flat against the first helix (H1) and the helices are arranged in an orthogonal bundle (Fig. 4). The protein is somewhat elongated, with dimensions of approximately 20 Â ° 30 Â 40 A. Seven residues at the C-terminus appear to protrude out of the globular protein and are probably more disordered than the rest of the protein. However, the specific conformations for this region that are represented in the structural ensemble (Fig. 4A) are merely a product of the force field used by X -PLOR and are not defined by the NMR data. A notable feature of the structure is a helix-turn-helix (HTH)-like structural motif centered on G80 that is flanked by H3 (residues 73 ­78) and H4 (residues 83­90). The structure similarity search program DALI identified several HTH proteins with significant similarity to the HTH-like motif in DsrC; the most similar structure was the tet repressor (2TCT.pdb) where the HTH motif (21 residues) could be superimposed on residues 70 ­91 of the average ° DsrC structure with 2.2 A rmsd for the Ca atoms (Fig. 5). The amino-acid sequence of this part of the structure was not

The structure was selected from the ensemble on the basis of high similarity to the average structure and a small number of restraint violations. Helices of the putative HTH-like structural motif are H3 and H4. Cysteine side chain heavy atoms are depicted as ball-and-stick models; the C69­C99 disulfide bond is partially obscured by H5.

reduction, perhaps indicating that its physiological state is the disulfide form. The differential reducibility of the two disulfides suggests either that upon addition of dithiothreitol to oxidized protein the C69 ­C99 bond is more accessible to reductant than the C5­C22 bond, or that in the absence of reductant the C5 and C22 sulfhydryls are more conformationally restricted to a position favorable for disulfide bond formation than the C69 and C99 sulfhydryls. Of these residues, C69 is nearest the surface of the protein, in a surface-exposed loop between H2 and H3. With reduction of the C69 ­C99 disulfide bond a local conformational change at or near C69 could place its sulfhydryl well away from C99 without impacting other parts of the structure. The structure of DsrC indicates that a similarly localized conformational change at C5, C22, or C99 would probably perturb the structure as these residues are more buried than C69. Disulfide bonds have been observed previously in a purified intracellular P. aerophilum protein expressed in E. coli [44] and appear to stabilize this protein at the growth temperature (98 8C) of P. aerophilum. It is unclear whether the disulfides in P. aerophilum DsrC are necessary for its function or occur incidentally. All five cysteines in P. aerophilum DsrC are also conserved in P. islandicum DsrC. C99 is conserved in all of the DsrC sequences from organisms that have dissimilatory sulfite reductases and is

absent in those that do not have this enzyme (Fig. 1). Cysteines equivalent to C5, C22, or C69 are not present in the other DsrC sequences, so these disulfide bonds do not exist in DsrC from other organisms. The fifth cysteine in P. aerophilum DsrC, C110, which is not involved with these disulfide bonds, is strictly conserved in all DsrC sequences and is probably critical to the function of DsrC. The flexible seven-residue C-terminal arm that protrudes from the middle of the folded protein is a distinctive feature of this protein, particularly because several residues in this segment are conserved in all sequences in the DsrC family of proteins (Figs 1 and 6). These are C110, K106, and two prolines, P105 and P107. The sequence conservation in the C-terminus, together with its greater flexibility relative to the rest of the protein, suggests that the function of C110 requires a specific interaction between DsrC and another molecule. This interacting partner is probably the a2b2 tetramer of dissimilatory sulfite reductase, which in Desulfovibrio species has been shown in most instances to bind its g subunit with high affinity. The crystal structure of the siroheme-binding b subunit of E. coli assimilatory sulfite reductase has been determined [45]. This subunit may resemble a fusion of one a and one b subunit from dissimilatory sulfite reductase [46]. A model can be envisioned in which the a2b2 tetramer binds to the

side of the g subunit from which the C-terminus protrudes, such that the C-terminus interacts with the a2b2 tetramer, perhaps inserting itself into the active site cleft. The C-terminus, when extended, is about the correct length for C110 to reach the siroheme-iron at the active site of

One conformation of the unstructured C-terminal arm (residues 104­111) is shown to emphasize its presence.

assimilatory sulfite reductase when the two structures are manually positioned next to one another with their surfaces in contact. In a model such as this, it is reasonable to expect conservation of the amino-acid sequence of the interacting C-terminal arm. The observation that two g subunits bind to each a2b2 tetramer in most cases [7,9,10] is consistent with a model that places the C-terminus of each bound g subunit in an active site cleft, as the a2b2 tetramer of most dissimilatory sulfite reductases contains two sirohemes and most likely two active sites. Conceivably, the interaction between the g subunit and the a2b2 tetramer could facilitate one of several processes: electron transfer between C110 and the siroheme or [4Fe24S] cofactors, interaction with bound substrate or product ions (such as sulfite, sulfide, or thiosulfate), assembly/folding/stabilization of the a2b2 tetramer and/or its cofactors [4], or perhaps sensing of a particular state of the siroheme or [4Fe24S] cofactors that requires adjustment of other cellular processes. Some of these possible roles are consistent with the different binding affinites of the g subunit for the a2b2 tetramer that have been reported in preparations derived from Desulfovibrio species [7,9 ­11], in the sense that binding may vary according to a characteristic of the a2b2 tetramer that changes during the cell cycle or with changes in the cell's environment. Alternatively, events occurring during purification procedures could result in dissociation of the g subunit. Some biochemical studies suggest that the g subunit confers thiosulfate reductase activity on dissimilatory sulfite reductase in D. desulfuricans [11]. There is also a suggestion that the g subunit purified from D. vulgaris functions together with the dsrD gene product as an independent thiosulfate reductase [14,47]. The strictly conserved cysteine residue one position away from the C-terminus (C110) could act as a reducing agent for thiosulfate bound in the active site of dissimilatory sulfite reductase, or of a putative DsrC/DsrD complex [13,14]. Alternatively it could simply prevent release of (or access to) partially reduced intermediates that can go on to form thiosulfate or trithionate by reaction with sulfite [46] as is known to occur with dissimilatory sulfite reductases in vitro. Because (in vivo ) sulfate reducing bacteria certainly produce sulfide, thiosulfate and trithionate formation may be an experimental artifact resulting from unknown changes to dissimilatory sulfite reductase that occur during purification. The presence of reverse sulfite reductase activity in vivo, in the sulfur oxidizing bacterium A. vinosum [5], and in vitro, where dissimilatory sulfite reductase can accelerate the oxidation of sulfide to sulfite, suggests that thiosulfate is not an obligatory intermediate [13]. The presence of dsrC in nonsulfate reducing bacteria such as E. coli has been interpreted to mean that DsrC does not participate in sulfite reduction directly, since assimilatory sulfite reductases do not release partially reduced intermediates, but are instead involved in formation or maintenance of the siroheme or [4Fe24S]-cluster cofactors [4]. The NMR-derived solution structure of P. aerophilum DsrC reveals a novel fold and a partially disordered sevenresidue C-terminal arm. While the structure does not directly answer any of the questions surrounding this protein in its guise as the g subunit of dissimilatory sulfite reductases purified from Desulfovibrio species and
