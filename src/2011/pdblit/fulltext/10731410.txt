Phosphoaspartates in bacterial signal transduction Ho S Cho*§, Jeffrey G Pelton*#, Dalai Yan¶, Sydney Kustu¥ and David E Wemmer
Bacteria use a strategy referred to as two-component signal transduction to sense a variety of stimuli and initiate an appropriate response. Signal processing begins with proteins referred to as histidine kinases. In most cases, these are membrane-bound receptors that respond to environmental cues. Histidine kinases use ATP as a phosphodonor to phosphorylate a conserved histidine residue. Subsequent transfer of the phosphoryl group to a conserved aspartyl residue in the cognate response regulator results in an appropriate output. Recent structural studies of activated (phosphorylated) response regulators and their aspartate-bearing regulatory domains have provided insight into the links between the chemistry and biology of these ubiquitous regulatory proteins. Chemical aspects of their function appear to generalize broadly to enzymes that adopt a phosphoaspartate intermediate.

response regulators and/or histidine kinases (HKs) in which several phosphotransfer steps precede appropriate output. For example, sporulation in Bacillus subtilis is controlled by a phosphorelay constituted by the response regulators Spo0F and Spo0A, and the histidine kinases KinA and Spo0B (for a recent review, see [3]). Likewise, sporulation in Myxococcus xanthus appears to involve a plethora of regulatory proteins carrying two-component signaling modules (e.g. see [4]). Genetic and molecular biological studies indicated that many regulatory domains act negatively on their downstream effector domains, inhibiting their function. A few regulatory domains, such as NtrCr and CheY, however, act positively. Phosphorylation of the regulatory domain of NtrC (NtrCr) promotes domain­domain interactions that lead to oligomerization of the intact protein. This in turn is required for ATPase activity and 54-mediated transcriptional activation. Enhanced binding of the phosphorylated form of CheY to its target protein FliM, which lies in the basal body of the flagellum, reverses the direction of flagellar rotation. CheY is unusual in being a single-domain response regulator comprising only a regulatory domain. Given the modular design and functional diversity of response regulators, how does the common chemical event of aspartate phosphorylation in the regulatory domain ultimately regulate the function of the effector domain or downstream target protein? Is there a general mechanism of activation? Recent structural studies are beginning to provide insights into the mechanistic bases of the negative and positive roles of receiver domains. For example, the crystal structures of inactive (unphosphorylated) NarL [5,6] and CheB [7] showed that the regulatory domains inhibit their effector domains through domain­domain interactions. Phosphorylation of the regulatory domain must alter these interactions to relieve inhibition, but may also have positive effects [8]. Although a complete model of the link between phosphorylation and signal output is not in place at atomic resolution, the structures of a variety of activated response regulators and regulatory domains have provided insights into the mechanism by which phosphorylation is coupled to activation.

Introduction
Sequence alignment of several hundred response regulators indicates that most are transcriptional regulators composed of two domains, an N-terminal regulatory or receiver domain of about 125 residues that can be phosphorylated on aspartate (around residue 55) and a C-terminal DNAbinding (or effector) domain (for recent reviews, see [1,2]). FixJ, NarL, OmpR, PhoB and Spo0A are examples of two-domain response regulators. DctD and NtrC, transcriptional activators of the 54 holoenzyme form of RNA polymerase, differ from the others in possessing a third (central) domain with an ATPase activity. CheB and CheY, both of which control the bacterial chemotactic response, are atypical because they lack a DNA-binding domain and do not regulate gene expression. Increasingly, there are reports of more complicated systems composed of multiple

Methods of activation
Response regulators possess an autokinase activity. Although phosphorylated HKs serve as their physiological phosphodonors, response regulators can also use smallmolecule phosphodonors such as acetyl phosphate and carbamyl phosphate. Response regulators also possess an intrinsic autophosphatase activity that limits the half-lives of their phosphorylated forms to a period between seconds

and hours. Both activities of response regulators require a divalent cation, usually magnesium. Until recently, the instability of the aspartyl­phosphate bond restricted structural studies of response regulators to their unphosphorylated forms. This limitation has now been overcome in several ways and has allowed the structure determination of activated response regulators and regulatory domains. Methods used include continuous phosphorylation by a low molecular weight phosphodonor (NtrCr) [9,10]; stripping of the active site metal ion with EDTA after phosphorylation (FixJr) [11]; use of a thermophilic protein (Spo0Ar) [12]; use of the aspartyl­phosphate mimic phosphono-cysteine (CheY) [13·]; and the formation of BeF3­­aspartate complexes (CheY) [14··,15·,16··]. The use of BeF3­ to form persistent complexes with response regulators appears to be a simple and general means of activating them for both biochemical and structural studies.

Active site
All regulatory domains studied to date have a common (/)5 topology. Their active sites are located at the C-terminal ends of the parallel  strands (Figure 1a) (reviewed in [1]). The active sites of regulatory domains are defined by the

sidechains of five highly conserved residues: three aspartates (Asp12, Asp13 and Asp57; CheY numbering); a lysine (Lys109); and a threonine (Thr87) or serine. A composite view of the active site interactions seen in the structures of P-FixJr, P-Spo0Ar and BeF3­­CheY reveals that these five residues bind to the aspartyl­phosphate group or the divalent cation (Figure 2). The phosphoryl (or BeF3­ group) is bonded to Asp57 and forms a hydrogen bond and a salt bridge, respectively, with the sidechains of Thr87 [ strand () 4] and Lys109 [5­helix (H) 5 loop]. The magnesium ion is coordinated by the sidechains of Asp13 (1­H1 loop); Asp57 (3); an oxygen of the phosphoryl group (or a fluorine of the BeF3­ group); the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Asn59 (3­H3 loop); and two water molecules. The sidechain of Asp12 (1­H1 loop) helps to position one of the water molecules that is coordinated to the magnesium ion and stabilizes the structure of the 1­H1 loop though hydrogen bonds to the amides of Asp13 and Phe14. Together, the hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between the sidechains of the conserved residues and the phosphoryl group and adjacent magnesium ion form a dense network that links together disparate elements of secondary structure.

Propagated conformational changes
Genetic [17,18] and NMR spectroscopic studies [10,19] indicated that the H4-5-H5 face of CheY (Figure 1) binds to FliM. A prominent residue on this face is Tyr106 (Figure 1a), which is highly conserved in response regulators as tyrosine or phenylalanine. X-ray structures of wild-type and mutant forms of CheY showed that the sidechain of Tyr106 could adopt either a solvent-exposed or a buried conformation. The sidechains of Tyr106 and Thr87 compete sterically for a hydrophobic pocket created by 4, H4 and the intervening loop (the 4­H4 pocket). It was inferred that the solventexposed and buried conformations of Tyr106 were correlated with the inactive and active states of CheY, respectively (reviewed in [20]). Recent structural evidence that the sidechain of Tyr106 is solvent-exposed in the inactive state is provided by the X-ray structure of inactive CheY bound to the recognition domain (P2) of its cognate HK, CheA [21­23], and by the X-ray structure of the inactive form of the methylesterase CheB [7]. In the former case, the hydroxyl group of Tyr106 is directed outward and forms hydrogen bonds with the sidechains of Glu178 and His181 in the P2 domain. In the latter case, the residue homologous to Tyr106 in the regulatory domain of CheB (Phe104) stacks with Phe195 of the effector domain, thereby stabilizing the inhibitory interdomain interaction. Comparisons of the recent structures of activated regulatory domains (P-Spo0Ar [12], P-FixJr [11,24] and BeF3­­CheY [14··,15·]) with their inactive forms show movement of the hydroxyl group of Thr87 toward the phosphate group or BeF3­ (with hydrogen-bond formation) and rotation of the Tyr106 sidechain into the 4­H4 pocket. The most compelling evidence that Tyr106 adopts the buried conformation in the active state is provided by the structure of BeF3­­CheY bound to the first 16 N-terminal residues of FliM (N16-FliM) [25··]. N16-FliM forms two turns of helix that pack against the H4-5-H5 face of CheY in a way that would be sterically precluded, or at least energetically disfavored, with Tyr106 in the solvent-exposed conformation (Figure 1b). Likewise, in the P-FixJr dimer, Phe101 (equivalent to Tyr106 of CheY) must be buried to allow H4

of one monomer to pack against the H4-5-H5 face of the other monomer. The active site interactions discussed above are likely to be preserved among all regulatory domains, but the effect of phosphorylation on the global structure of each may be different. For example, BeF3­ activation of CheY induces only minor backbone displacements in the C terminus of 4 and the N termini of helices H4 and H5. Larger backbone displacements are observed in the 4­H4 and 5­H5 loops, although dynamics studies indicate that these loops are flexible (see below). Similarly, upon phosphorylation, FixJr shows slight displacements in the N terminus of H4 and a large displacement in the 4­H4 loop, but no changes in the 5­H5 loop or H5. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments indicated that no large structural changes accompany phosphorylation of the regulatory domain of CheB [26]. In contrast to the above cases, phosphorylation of NtrCr caused dramatic backbone displacements in the H3-4-H4-5 face [9]. A higher resolution NMR structure of BeF3­­NtrCr confirmed the large backbone changes in H4, but indicated smaller changes in H3 (CA Hastings, D Wemmer, unpublished data).

Dynamics
It was first recognized in CheY that regulatory domains have significant structural flexibility [20,27]. CheY structures show variability in the loops that connect the strands and helices, especially the 4­H4 loop and the N terminus of H4. 15N NMR relaxation studies were used to probe dynamics directly in several response regulators and regulatory domains: the inactive forms of CheY [27] and Spo0F [28], and both the inactive and active forms of NtrCr [29··]. In the inactive forms of Spo0F and NtrCr, the 3­H3 and 4­H4 loops, the N terminus of H4 and 5 show motions on an intermediate (microsecond to millisecond) timescale. Flexibility in the loop regions correlates with the multiple conformations observed in X-ray and NMR investigations of CheY [20,27], and can complicate quantification of conformational changes that occur upon activation.

Catalysis and regulation

Interestingly, residues in Spo0F that show motions on an intermediate timescale are precisely those involved in protein­protein interactions. Similarly, residues in NtrCr that show motions on an intermediate timescale lie in regions that undergo structural changes upon activation and are implicated in interdomain interactions [30]. These studies suggest that, even in the absence of phosphorylation, Spo0F and NtrCr undergo structural fluctuations that encompass the active conformation (see also Update). Phosphorylation can then be seen as driving the equilibrium (populations of inactive and active conformers) toward the conformation of the active species, as opposed to effecting a defined switch from an inactive to an active conformer. In the case of OmpR, the pre-existing equilibrium between inactive and active conformers also appears to be influenced by the binding of the effector domain to DNA [31] and, in the case of CheY, by binding to N16-FliM [32]. Similar ideas were proposed based on studies of mutant forms of CheY [33] and are in agreement with the finding that many response regulators show some activity even when not phosphorylated.

Prospects
Although much has been learned over the past two years, most of the structural work on activation has been performed with isolated regulatory domains, rather than full-length response regulators. (Recall that CheY is atypical.) Hence, the interplay between the chemistry of phosphoaspartate bond formation in regulatory domains and activation -- or relief of inhibition -- of the biological function of their effector domains remains poorly defined. Along with more classical methods, recent application of methods such as cryo-electron microscopy [39], irondependent cleavage [30] and the use of BeF3­ to maintain the activated state [16··] should facilitate biochemical and structural studies of intact response regulators and will contribute to better understanding the functions of this dominant class of prokaryotic regulatory protein. At least some of these methods are also promising for structural studies of covalent enzyme intermediates of the HAD superfamily and for defining energy coupling mechanisms in P-type ATPases.

Update Extensions
The quintet of active site residues involved in phosphorylation and activation of regulatory domains is also conserved in members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, which form phosphoaspartate enzyme intermediates [34,35]. These include phosphatases, phosphomutases and phosphorylation-dependent ion pumps (P-type ATPases). Recently, X-ray structures were solved for two such proteins. The structure of a calcium pump in the unphosphorylated state [36·] showed that the domain that becomes phosphorylated (P domain) is structurally homologous to CheY. The sidechains of conserved active site residues were positioned similarly to those of inactive regulatory domains. Likewise, structures of phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP) [37,38] showed that its core / domain was structurally homologous to both CheY and the P domain of the calcium pump. Comparison of the structure of a BeF3­ complex with PSP, which mimics the short-lived phosphoenzyme intermediate, to that of BeF3­­CheY revealed that the conserved active site residues of both form very similar hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with BeF3­ and the magnesium ion. Taken together, the similarities between PSP, the calcium pump and CheY suggest that the conformational changes that drive ion translocation in P-type ATPases are likely to propagate from the site of phosphorylation by means similar to those that lead to activation of regulatory domains. Namely, the conserved threonine (Thr625) and lysine (Lys684) of the P domain will probably form a hydrogen bond and a salt bridge with the phosphoryl group. The five conserved active site residues (three aspartates, threonine/serine and lysine) comprise a structural motif that appears to be intimately linked to the chemistry of reversible phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of aspartyl residues. This motif has been used repeatedly to effect a wide range of biological functions [34,35]. It has been known for some time that apo CheY shows residual activity [40], suggesting that, like Spo0F and NtrC, there is a dynamic equilibrium between active or partially active and inactive conformers in the apo state. A recent high-resolution X-ray structure of apo CheY [41·] provides compelling new evidence that this is indeed the case. Two distinct conformations were observed within the crystal. In one conformation, which resembles the structure of CheY seen in other X-ray studies of the apo protein [2,42], Tyr106 is directed outward and is sterically precluded from adopting the buried conformation by residues in the 4­H4 loop. The second conformation more closely resembles the active conformer seen in the BeF3­­CheY­N16-FliM complex [25··]. The Tyr106 sidechain is buried in the 4­H4 pocket, with concomitant adjustment of the residues in the 4­H4 loop. It was suggested that this second conformation, called the meta-active state, is responsible for the residual activity of apo CheY.
