INTRODUCTION Prodigiosin is a red pigment synthesized by a restricted group of bacteria such as Streptomyces and Serratia as a second metabolite.1,2 This chemical is a member of prodiginines, natural tripyrrole pigments, which have a common pyrroly dipyrroly methane structure.3 Although the biological activity of prodiginin in the strain has not been defined yet, it has been known to have immunosuppressive, antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antimalarial activities.3,4 As an anticancer agent, it induces apoptosis in various kinds of cancer cells and it also has an antimetastatic effect.5­7 Therefore, it shows some promise as a new immunosuppressant and anticancer drug. A redpigmented bacterium, Hahella chejuensis was isolated from coastal marine sediment of Jeju Island, Korea.8 These bacteria have algicidal effects and can kill Cochlodinium, which causes red tide. The bacteria produced red pigments in the cell envelope, and the main red-colored part was identified as prodigiosin. Recently, a full-genome sequence of H. chejuensis revealed hap genes, a gene cluster, which is similar to the red gene cluster for the prodigiosin biosynthesis of Streptomyces coelicolor.9 Four prodiginin biosynthetic gene clusters have been reported and the prodigiosin-biosynthetic pathway has been studied at the biochemical and molecular levels with the red gene cluster from S. coelicolor and pig gene cluster of Serratia marcescens.10­13 The Hahella hap gene cluster consists of 14 genes (hapA to hapN), and the gene content and organization resembles that of the Serratia pig gene cluster.9

All functions of hap gene products are assigned, except for HapK, which is based on red gene and pig gene products. The functions of HapK and the equivalents, PigK and RedY, are still unknown.2,13 HapK is a small protein, which consists of 105 amino acid residues. A BLAST search with the HapK sequence showed only a few homologues such as PigK and RedY. The sequence identities of HapK to PigK and RedY are 43 and 52%, respectively. No similar proteins are in any other organisms. It is very unique for the prodigiosin biosynthetic bacteria and is highly conserved among them. The pigK deletion mutant of S. marcescens suggests that PigK might function in the biosynthesis of methoxy-bipyrrole carbaldehyde (MBC), as an intermediate for prodigiosin biosynthesis.13 If HapK, PigK, or RedY are not necessary for prodigosin biosynthesis, there is no need to be conserved or unique among these bacteria. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the hapK gene product to reveal its unknown functions based on its molecular structure.

Data Collection and Refinement Statistics

The gene encoding HapK from H. chejuensis was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into the expression vector pET30a. The DNA sequence of the inserted fragment in the recombinant plasmid (pET30a:hapK) was confirmed and then, the plasmid was transformed into the methionine auxotroph Escherichia coli strain B834 (Novagen) for the over-expression of the SeMet substituted protein. An overgrown culture was inoculated into 2 L of a minimal medium supplemented with 50 lg/mL SeMet and 30 lg/ mL kanamycin. The cells were grown at 378C. The expression of the HapK protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside, to a final concentration of 1 mM at the log phase (OD600 ¼ 0.6). The cells were grown for an additional 16 h at 228C. Harvested cells were resuspended in buffer A (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0 containing 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol) and disrupted by sonication on ice. To purify the Hexa-His tagged recombinant proteins, this solution was loaded onto a Ni­NTA agarose (QIAGEN) column and the recombinant proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 300 mM imidazole. For further purification, the eluted fraction was applied onto a HiTrap Q Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and then, size exclusion chromatography was performed with a Superdex G-200 pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The purified SeMet-substituted protein contains a Hexa-His tag (LEHHHHHH) at the carboxyterminus.

Structure determination Crystallization and data collection

The recombinant HapK protein was concentrated and subjected to initial crystallization screening at 293 K, using a hanging drop-vapor diffusion method with commercially available crystal-screening solution sets from Hampton Research and Emerald Biosystems. Crystals were obtained under two conditions, 2M ammonium sulfate with 5% isopropanol and 1.26M ammonium sulfate in 0.1M cacodylate, pH 6.5. After optimization, the best crystals were obtained from a drop containing 2 lL of 20 mg/mL protein and 2 lL of a reservoir solution containing 1.8M ammonium sulfate and 7% isopropanol in 0.1M cacodylate, pH 6.5. A single crystal was transferred to reservoir solution containing 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant prior to X-ray data collection. Diffraction data were collected at the peak wavelength ° (0.97949 A) with 18 oscillation using an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD area detector at 4A beamline (MXW) at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL, Pohang, Korea). The diffraction data were integrated and scaled with space group P3 using the HKL2000 suite.14

The crystal space group was found to be P3212, and ° the unit cell parameters were 58.3 3 58.3 3 137.9 A3. With two molecules per asymmetric unit, the Matthew's ° coefficient was calculated to be 2.7 A3/Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 53.4%. Six Se atoms were identified in the asymmetric unit using SOLVE15 and the initial phase has a figure of merit (FOM) of 0.345. Density modification and subsequent automated model building were done with RESOLVE,16 increasing FOM to 0.651 with 84% (189 amino acid residues) of the residues built. The RESOLVE-built partial model was used as a guide to build the remainder of the protein manually into density-modified electron density maps with the program O.17 We could not find the electron density for the Cterminal Hexa-His tags in both molecules. Refinement with isotropic displacement parameters was performed with CCP4 refmac5.18 The Rwork and Rfree values of the refined structure are 0.19 and 0.22, respectively. Crystallographic data statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model has been deposited in the worldwide Protein Data Bank19 under the PDB ID code 2jdj.

Crystal Structure of HapK

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Overall structure

There are two HapK monomers in an asymmetric unit. A monomer structure consists of a four-stranded antiparallel b-sheet, three a-helices, and a short C-terminal tail [Fig. 1(A)]. Three a-helices face the sheet. The structure belongs to a­b sandwich group of the (a þ b)-fold class. Helices a2 and a3 form a long helix with a 738 kink in the middle. Two ferredoxin-like split babfolds form an antiparallel sheet with the strand order of 4-1-3-2. The kink makes the distance between the a2­a3 helix and the b4 strand wider. With the surface presentation of HapK, we found a deep cavity at the face, which consisted of a kinked helix and a b4 strand [Fig. 1(B)]. ° The cavity is about 10 A in depth and has a wide opening. In the crystal structure, one glycerol molecule and one isopropanol molecule are found in the cavity. Both heteromolecules were in the cryo-protectant solution. There are hydrophobic interactions at the surface facing the isopropanol. This area consists of hydrophobic residues, Leu34, Phe40, Ile59, Phe67, and Phe76. At the opposite side of the area in the cavity, hydroxyl groups from isopropanol and glycerol have hydrogen-bonds with Aps27 and Glu57, respectively. The overall surface of the cavity is hydrophobic and two negatively charged residues are located on one side of the cavity and have a hydrogen-bond network, which is connecting to HapK surface through His6 and Glu92. Although two molecules in an asymmetric unit have salt bridges between Asp68 and Arg64, the contact between the two molecules is at a limited area. One monomer and its symmetrical molecule, however, through a crystallographic twofold axis intertwine each other using their extruded C-terminal tails [Fig. 1(C)]. The C-terminal tails of each molecule interact with the b-sheet of other monomer, like the fifth strand in the five-stranded b-sheet. The b-sheets of the two monomers form a distorted barrel like a 10-strand, antiparallel b-barrel. The overall shape of the dimer is globular. This, along with twofold symmetrical interaction, would suggest a biologically relevant homodimer. Another dimer by twofold axis with the second molecule in asymmetric unit has same intermolecular interactions as the first dimer. Gel filtration during purification confirmed that HapK is a dimer in a solution. In the homodimer, two cavities are located at the same side and are separated by loop regions between the b2 and b3 strands of both monomers. The area around the binding cavity is charged negatively and the region between the two cavities is neutral. At the backside of this area in the dimer, there is a positively charged valley, which has formed between the two bsheets. Since PigK and RedY are similar to HapK, those proteins could have a similar cavity. The sequences of

A cavity with the conserved residues among HapK homologues. A: The multiple sequence alignment of HapK with PigK and RedY. Amino acid sequences of the HapK from Hahella chejuensis (Hch_HapK), PigK from Serratia marcescens (Sma_PigK), and RedY from Streptomyces coelicolor (Sco_RedY) and from Pseudoalteromonas tunicata (Ptu_RedY) were aligned. Numbering shown is from HapK. Earlier shown alignments are elements of secondary structure of HapK. Conserved residues are in red background and two negatively charged residues in the cavity are marked with blue triangles. B: Location of conserved residues in HapK. Side chains of the conserved residues (green) are only shown. C: A dipyrrole intermediate (HBM) was placed in the cavity of HapK as a putative binding partner. Surface contour image contains the ribbon diagram with side chains of the conserved residues as shown at B. Multiple alignment was done using the T-coffee software and visualized using ESPript software both located on the ExPASy Proteomics Server (http://au.expasy.org/).

HapK and others are aligned [Fig. 2(A)]. About onethird of the residues are conserved and those are mostly hydrophobic residues, including Leu34, Phe40, Ile59, Phe67, and Phe76, which face the cavity. Two negatively charged residues, Asp27 and Glu57 are also conserved. As expected, those conserved residues surround the cavity [Fig. 2(B)]. It implies that the size and charge distribution are conserved among the cavities from HapK, PigK, and RedY. These partially negatively charged hydrophobic cavities could hold the same target molecule.

Structural similarity

A search with the DALI server20 reveals proteins that are structurally similar to HapK. Although sequence similarity is low, there are a few structurally similar proteins. The Dali server yields seven structures with Z-scores above 9 (Table II). An oxidoreductase, actVA-ORF6 monooxygenase (1LQ9), from S. coelicolor,21 shows the highest Z-score of 10.4. Those structurally similar proteins have one b-sheet and three a-helices, and the root mean square differences of the structures to HapK are ° between 2.3 and 3.0 A. The sequence identities between

Z-score represents the statistical significance of the best domain­domain alignment. RMSD represents the root mean square deviation of C atoms in rigid body superimposition. c % Identity reflects the number of identical residues to Hahella chejuensis HapK protein.

HapK and the proteins range between 6 and 17% and the identity of the HapK to actVA-ORF6 monooxygenase is 10%. Although the biological functions of those proteins are mostly unknown, those of some proteins are known as actVA-ORF6 monooxygenase, rhamnose mutarotase (1 3 8D) from E. coli,22 and a heme-degrading enzyme, IsdG (1SQE) from Staphylococcus aureus.23 The substrate binding sites of these proteins are at the cavity between the b-sheet and a-helices of the proteins. Those proteins also form a homodimer in the same manner, interacting at the b-sheet region. Therefore, we predict that HapK is an enzyme with an active site in the cavity. Its structural similarity to the actVA-ORF6 monooxygenase suggests that its function is of an oxidoreductase.

Implications in prodigiosin biosynthesis

A detailed, biosynthetic pathway is being studied in pig gene cluster. Prodigiosin is synthesized by the condensation of 2-methyl-3-amyl-pyrrole (MAP) and MBC.12 The combination of MAP with HBC, which has a hydroxyl group instead of a methoxyl group, produces norprodigiosin. The ratio of prodigiosin to norprodigiosin depends on the strain. HBC and MBC are produced from 4hydroxy-2,20 -bipyrrole-5-methanol (HBM), which is synthesized using proline, malonyl-CoA, and serine, by several pig gene products.11,13 The oxidation of HBM by PigM produces HBC, and MBC is generated from HBC by o-methylation by PigF.13 It is a two-step process to make MBC from HBM, oxidation and methylation. We, however, thought of an alternative pathway, first methylation and then oxidation. In this pathway, HBC is not generated and this could make prodigiosin more efficient than norprodigiosin, since the ratio between MBC and HBC would affect on the ratio between norprodigiosin and prodigiosin in a strain. Having an alternative pathway, however, requires more oxidation activity from PigM or other oxidoreductases. If HapK is involved in this bifurcate pathway, the HapK deletion mutant still could make prodigiosin using an alternative pathway. It has been reported that the pigKD mutant Serratia strain could synthesize prodigiDOI 10.1002/prot

osin.13 The PigKD mutant, however, makes less prodigiosin than the wild type, and the ratio between norprodigiosin and prodigiosin in the mutant was changed. These facts indicate that HapK might be involved in MBC generation. If HapK has an oxidoreductase activity, a bipyrrole intermediate may be a substrate of HapK for oxidation. We placed a HBM molecule in the pocket of HapK manually [Fig. 2(C)]. The size of the bipyrrole is appropriate for the cavity. As described earlier, this cavity is surrounded with hydrophobic residues and negatively charged residues. The cavity also supports the electrostatic interaction of HBM. A methylated form of HBM also could bind at the pocket since there is an enough space for a methyl group. Considering its size and charge distribution, this pocket could be a binding site for a bipyrrole intermediate from prodigiosin biosynthesis. To summarize, hapk is a highly conserved homologue of redY and pigK, in a prodigiosin biosynthesis gene cluster. The HapK structure belongs to the ferrodoxin-like a þ b sandwich, with an antiparallel b-sheet, and it forms a dimer using the C-terminal tail. It is structurally similar to the actVA-orf6 monooxygenase from S. coelicolor. HapK has a highly conserved pocket and it could bind a bipyrrole intermediate such as HBM or MBM. For future research, there should be binding tests with those intermediates and an assay to determine whether HapK is a simple carrier or if it is involved in oxidation. REFERENCES
