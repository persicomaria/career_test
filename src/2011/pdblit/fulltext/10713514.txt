Chymotrypsin is a member of the trypsin family of serine proteases and is one of the ®rst proteins successfully studied by X-ray crystallography. It is secreted into the intestine as the inactive precursor chymotrypsinogen; four sequential cleavages of the peptide bonds following residues 13, 15, 146 and 148 occur to generate the active %, , and  forms of chymotrypsin. 13C NMR has shown [O'Connell & Malthouse (1995). Biochem. J. 307, 353±359] that when the  form of chymotrypsin is inhibited by 2-13C-enriched benzyloxycarbonylglycylglycylphenylalanyl chloromethane, a tetrahedral adduct is formed which is thought to be analogous to the tetrahedral intermediate formed during catalysis. This inhibitor complex has been crystallized as a dimer in space Ê group P41212. The structure has been re®ned at 2.14 A resolution to an R value of 21.2% (free R = 25.2%). Conformational differences between -chymotrypsin and chymotrypsinogen in the region of the ¯exible autolysis loop (residues 145±150) were observed. This is the ®rst crystal structure of -chymotrypsin and includes two residues which are disordered in previous crystal structures of active Ê chymotrypsin. A difference of 11.3 A2 between the average B values of the monomers within the asymmetric unit is caused by lattice-disordering effects approximating to rotation of the molecules about a crystallographic screw axis. The substrate-binding mode of the inhibitor was similar to other chymotrypsin peptidyl inhibitor complexes, but this is the ®rst published chymotrypsin structure in which the tetrahedral chloromethyl ketone transition-state analogue is observed. This structure is compared with that of a similar tetrahedral transition-state analogue which does not alkylate the activesite histidine residue.

1. Introduction
The structure and mechanism of the serine protease chymotrypsin have been investigated in detail (Matthews et al., 1967; Blow et al., 1969; Blow, 1976). The enzyme is composed of two -barrels, which are thought to have evolved by gene duplication of a less active ancestral protease (McLachlan, 1979). Chymotrypsin is a digestive enzyme that hydrolyzes proteins in the small intestine and, because of its proteolytic activity, it is stored and secreted into the small intestine as the inactive precursor chymotrypsinogen. In the small intestine, chymotrypsinogen is cleaved by trypsin at the peptide bond following Arg15, yielding the fully active %-chymotrypsin. Subsequent autocatalytic hydrolysis of the bonds following residues 13, 146 and 148 and release of the resulting dipeptides gives rise to the , and  forms of the enzyme (Fig. 1). - and

-chymotrypsin are covalently identical but conformationally different and exist in a pH-dependent equilibrium. The ®rst step in the pathway in Fig. 1 (cleavage of the Arg15±Ile16 bond) brings about complete activation of chymotrypsinogen by liberation of the -amino group of Ile16. Ê Translation of this liberated group by 12 A to form a salt bridge with Asp194 provides the driving force for the formation of a productive binding site. The % and  forms, although rapidly converted to - and -chymotrypsin under conditions of high enzyme concentration and low substrate concentration, are thought to be the most abundant in the gut (Sharma & Hopkins, 1979). While the biochemical behaviour of - and -chymotrypsin is in many ways identical, some differences have been noted and explained by the presence in the  form of a complete autolysis loop. The two forms differ strikingly in their susceptibility to inactivation at high pH, which is caused by the loss of the salt bridge between Ile16 and Asp194. It has been observed that the intact loop adjacent to the active site of -chymotrypsin hinders reversible inactivation at high pH, making it 80 times more active than -chymotrypsin at pH 11 (Valenzuela & Bender, 1969). The mechanism of inactivation of -chymotrypsin also differs from that of - and -chymotrypsin, which adopt a third conformation ± different to those of both active chymotrypsin and chymotrypsinogen ± upon inactivation (Mavridis et al., 1974). It is thought that -chymotrypsin is restricted from adopting alternative conformations by the presence of the autolysis loop and may oscillate between active and chymotrypsinogen-like structures (Ghelis et al., 1975). A ®nal effect of the cleavage of the Tyr146±Thr147 bond is an increased interaction between -chymotrypsin molecules at low pH (Neet et al., 1974) owing to the creation of a free carboxyl group on Tyr146. The only crystallographic study carried out on -chymoÊ trypsin to date is that of Kraut et al. (1970), who calculated 5 A difference density maps of %- and -chymotrypsin and concluded that the overall structures of the %,  and  forms were similar. The inhibitor used in this study was 2-13C-enriched benzyloxycarbonylglycylglycylphenylalanyl chloromethane [Z-Gly-Gly-(2-13C)Phe-CH2Cl] (Fig. 3), a substrate-derived inhibitor which was used in 13C NMR experiments to study oxyanion formation in both chymotrypsin and subtilisin (O'Connell & Malthouse, 1995). Chloromethane inhibitors alkylate N43 of the imidazole ring of the active-site histidine residue in serine proteases (Ong et al., 1965). X-ray crystallographic evidence (Poulos et al., 1976; James et al., 1980) suggests that the active-site serine adds to the inhibitor to form a tetrahedral adduct analogous to the tetrahedral intermediate thought to be formed during catalysis (Fig. 3). 13C NMR has been used to con®rm that the hemiketal C atoms in these chloromethane-inhibitor complexes are sp3 hybridized (Malthouse et al., 1983, 1985; Finucane et al., 1989; Finucane & Malthouse, 1992; O'Connell & Malthouse, 1995). 13C NMR has also been used to determine the degree of oxyanion stabilization in these tetrahedral adducts, which has provided important insights into how the serine proteases stabilize tetrahedral intermediates during catalysis. However, it has been suggested that alkylation of the active-site histidine by chloromethane inhibitors could force the oxyanion out of its optimal position for forming hydrogen bonds in the oxyanion hole (Liang & Abeles, 1987). Therefore, one of the aims of this study was to determine whether this was true. Because the substrate residues of these inhibitors can easily be altered, they also ®nd use as speci®c protease inhibitors, many of which are pharmaceutically important (Banner &

Á Hadvary, 1991; Navia et al., 1989). Crystals structures of several serine proteases with bound chloromethane inhibitors Ê have been solved, including an unre®ned 2.7 A -chymotrypsin structure with incomplete inhibitor electron density (Segal et al., 1971). In that structure, however, it was only possible to locate the peptidyl portion of the inhibitor (using difference maps and inhibitors of various peptide lengths) owing to non-isomorphism of the native and inhibited crystals. Here, we describe the crystal structure of -chymotrypsin at Ê 2.14 A covalently bound to the inhibitor Z-Gly-Gly-PheCH2Cl and contrast it with the structures of -chymotrypsin and, in the region of the autolysis loop, chymotrypsinogen. Furthermore, a marked difference between the average B values of the molecules within the asymmetric unit has revealed an unusual lattice effect in this crystal structure, which is described. chloride ion and 381 water molecules. An alternative conformation was added for Met192 of molecule A. 89.6% of residues fell within the favoured regions and 10.4% within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968). A summary of the re®nement statistics is given in Table 1.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Crystallization and data collection

Z-Gly-Gly-(2-13C)Phe-CH2Cl inhibited -chymotrypsin was prepared as previously described (O'Connell & Malthouse, 1995). Crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapourdiffusion method at 298 K using 30 mg mlÀ1 protein equilibrated against 2.6 M ammonium sulfate, 10 mM CoCl2 and 200 mM MES±HCl at pH 6.5. Crystals grew as large tetragonal bipyramids in space group P41212, with unit-cell parameters Ê a = b = 121.4, c = 116.1 A. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a 300 mm MAR Research imaging-plate scanner at 293 K Ê to a resolution of 2.14 A using synchrotron radiation from the EMBL beamline X11 at the DORIS storage ring, DESY, Hamburg (data-collection and processing statistics are listed in Table 1).
2.2. Structure solution and refinement

The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) version of the program AMoRe and the -chymotrypsin coordinate set of Brady et al. (1990) as a search model. The inhibitor was built using HyperChem (Hypercube Inc., 1115 NW 4th Street, Gainesville, FL 32601, USA) and was geometry-optimized before being ®tted to difference electron density. The covalent bond lengths from CT of the inhibitor to His57 N42 and from C of the inhibitor to Ê Ser195 O were restrained in PROTIN to 1.45 and 1.47 A, respectively. The structure of chymotrypsinogen (Hecht et al., 1991) was used as a guide in ®tting the autolysis loop of -chymotrypsin. Maximum-likelihood re®nement was carried out with twofold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints using the program REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) and ordered water molecules were added using the program ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1997). After initial re®nement, a chloride ion was located and double occupancy was observed for several residues. The ®nal model consisted of a dimer containing 3528 protein atoms, 58 inhibitor atoms, one

The overall structure of -chymotrypsin was identical to that of -chymotrypsin, except in the region of the autolysis loop (residues 145±150) which is intact only in the  form. Residues Ser11 and Gly12 are ordered in both molecules and Leu13 is ordered in molecule B, making -chymotrypsin the only active form of the enzyme in which all residues are located [residues 11±13 are missing from the structures of the  and  forms in the Protein Data Bank (PDB; Bernstein et al., 1977)]. These residues point toward the solvent in -chymotrypsin and are held in position by crystal contacts. Leu13 of molecule B is additionally stabilized by an interaction with Leu143 O via an ordered water molecule. The side chains of the following residues are disordered (or partially disordered) and are excluded from the model: Gln7 and lysines 36, 79, 84, 87 and 170 of molecule A; Lys36, Lys79 and Arg145 of molecule B. A single chloride ion was located close to the crystallographic twofold NCS axis. The chloride binds to residues 59 and 90 of molecules A and B, respectively, and is surrounded by four ordered water molecules. This chloride ion is absent from previous chymotrypsin structures and binds at a different location to the sulfate ion which has been observed in several crystal structures of -chymotrypsin. No cobalt was present, despite the fact that crystals failed to grow when CoCl2 in the reservoir solution was replaced with other chloride salts. The B factors were considerably higher in molecule A than Ê in molecule B (35.2 versus 23.9 A2) of the asymmetric unit. Molecules A and B were least-squares ®tted and all regions of

The r.m.s. deviations between main-chain and side-chain atoms for the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are 0.28 Ê and 0.79 A, respectively, after re®nement with weak NCS restraints (weak main chain and side chain as speci®ed in PROTIN). The inhibitor (Fig. 3) binds in an antiparallel  structure similar to previous structures (Segal et al., 1971), except that there appears to be no hydrogen bond between the carbonyl O atom of Gly216 and atom N3 of the inhibitor. This is

probably because of steric repulsion between the phenyl group of the inhibitor and the large side chain of Trp172. The benzyloxycarbonyl portion was well ordered, despite the lack of hydrogen bonding to the protein in this region. This can be seen in Fig. 4, which shows the covalently bound inhibitor and an Fo À Fc electron-density map at the active site, which was calculated using the phases of the re®ned model with the inhibitor omitted. The previously unobserved distortions of residues His57 and Ser195 of the active site were signi®cant, Ê with shifts of 0.7 and 1.0 A for atoms His57 N42 and Ser195 O, respectively. This decreases the distance between these two Ê Ê atoms from 3.8 A in uninhibited -chymotrypsin to 3.0 A in this structure. The inhibitors of molecules A and B in the Ê asymmetric unit lie within 5 A of each other and have very similar geometry. The inhibitor binding and geometry are detailed in Table 3.

Our re®ned model of -chymotrypsin inhibited by Z-GlyGly-(2-13C)Phe-CH2Cl was compared with the structure, determined by Brady et al. (1990), of the adduct formed between -chymotrypsin and N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-phenylalanyl tri¯uoromethyl ketone. Owing to the alkylation of His57 N42 in the chloromethane-inhibitor adduct, the hemiketal C atom Ê of the inhibitor is only 2.72 A from His57 N42 (Fig. 5a). This Ê distance is 4.12 A in the tri¯uoromethyl ketone inhibitor adduct (Fig. 5b), in which the histidine is not alkylated. Therefore, alkylation of His57 increases the distance between Ê His57 N1 and the carboxylate C atom of Asp102 by 0.44 A (Fig. 5). It also only increases the hydrogen bonds from the oxyanion to the backbone NH groups of Gly193 and Ser195 by Ê 0.18 and 0.65 A, respectively (Fig. 5). Thus, while alkylation of the active-site histidine residue causes some movement of the active-site groups, the tetrahedral adduct formed with chloromethane inhibitors are expected to be reasonable

analogues of tetrahedral intermediates formed during catalysis. The re®ned model of -chymotrypsin was also compared (Fig. 6) with the structure of chymotrypsinogen (Hecht et al., 1991) by least-squares ®tting of the main-chain atoms (excluding residues 10±16) using the program LSQKAB (Kabsch, 1978). The overall structures were found to be Ê similar, with r.m.s. deviations of 0.4 and 1.25 A for main-chain and side-chain atoms, respectively, except in the region of Ile16 and the autolysis loop (Fig. 2; Table 2). The movement of Ile16 to form a salt bridge with Asp194 upon activation has been extensively studied (Freer et al., 1970) and its position in -chymotrypsin is identical to that in other active forms. The autolysis loop is known from chymotrypsinogen structures to be inherently ¯exible and has different conformations in two chymotrypsinogen structures in the PDB. All comparisons were made with the autolysis loop of the BPTIbound chymotrypsinogen structure of Hecht et al. (1991), which resembles that of -chymotrypsin more closely than that of Wang et al. (1985). The differences include a rotation of $150 of the carbonyl bond of Asn148 and a slight movement of the loop towards the centre of the protein. Two notable differences between the structures of chymotrypsinogen and -chymotrypsin may contribute to relocation of the loop. Firstly, the movement of residues Ile16±Gly19 upon activation of chymotrypsinogen causes the loss of the hydrogen bond between Asn18 and Thr144. Secondly, the carbonyl O atom of Ile16 of -chymotrypsin lies close to the carbonyl O atom of

Ê Ê residue Leu143 (3.4 A; 3.0 A from Ile16 of -chymotrypsin to Leu143 of the superimposed chymotrypsinogen structure). The autolysis loop is involved in crystal contacts in chymotrypsinogen and -, %- and -chymotrypsin and it is evident that the change in conformation was also a consequence of differences in crystal packing (Table 4). The terminal atoms of the side chains of Arg145 and Tyr146 of -chymotrypsin and Ê chymotrypsinogen deviate by 4.0 A to form hydrogen bonds with symmetry-related molecules. A large shift in the position of Ser76 is caused solely by intermolecular contacts and an examination of other chymotrypsin structures revealed a range of positions for this residue. As well as providing a more complete structure of active chymotrypsin, this structure allows a more detailed examination of this intermediate form of chymotrypsin and its covalent interactions with chloromethane inhibitors. Determination of a subtilisin-bound chloromethane crystal structure will permit an interesting comparison of the modes of stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate in these enzymes.

3.3. Extended lattice disorder in d-chymotrypsin

A marked difference between the average B values of the molecules within the asymmetric unit pointed towards an unusual lattice effect in this crystal structure. Normally, the observed effect of lattice interactions is the localized immobilization of side chains or surface loops, as exempli®ed by the correlation of residue B values with the fractional accessible surface of that residue in a given crystal lattice. In some cases, it is possible to observe a second, long-range lattice effect owing to static or dynamic rotational disorder about a crystallographic screw axis. This type of disorder is revealed by a correlation between B value and distance from the crystallographic axis. Lattice interactions were investigated by plotting the difference in B factor of each residue (ÁB) between molecules A and B of the asymmetric unit against the difference in their distance from the screw axis (ÁR; Fig. 7). Despite scattering of the points caused by non-equivalent local lattice effects, a correlation between ÁB and ÁR can be clearly observed (correlation 0.44, or 0.48 when residues 10±12 and 73±76 are excluded based on their large non-equivalent local lattice effects). This effect was ®rst noticed in the case of cytochrome cH (Finzel & Salemme, 1985) and little has been published on the subject since. The plot indicates an increase Ê of 18 A2 owing to long-range disorder at the periphery of molecule A, suggesting an axial rotation about the screw axis of approximately 0.5 that produces a maximum displacement Ê of 0.8 A. The slightly higher than average R value of the re®ned structure is probably a consequence of this extended lattice disorder. Lattice interactions of this type can equally arise in cases where only a single molecule occupies the asymmetric unit and could easily be mistaken for increased inherent mobility resulting from secondary-structure elements within the protein. This highlights the need to closely inspect

the crystal packing before invoking B factors as indicators of protein-domain mobility. AMS was supported by a Forbairt fellowship. MAW was supported by an EC Institutional Fellowship, contract CT 930485.

Plot of the difference in mean backbone B value (ÁB) between corresponding residues of -chymotrypsin monomers against their difference in radial distance (ÁR) from the crystal screw axis on which the B molecules are aligned. The least-squares line suggests that the longÊ range disorder contributes up to 18 A2 to the residues furthest from the screw axis. Large deviations from the least-squares line correspond to non-equivalent crystal contacts.
