Abstract Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) is an essential enzyme in Coenzyme A biosynthesis. Because bacterial PPAT and mammalian PPAT are dissimilar, this enzyme is an attractive antibacterial target. Based on the structure of the substrate, 4phosphopantetheine, a dipeptide library was designed, synthesised and tested against Escherichia coli PPAT. The most potent inhibitor PTX040334 was co-crystallised with E. coli PPAT. With this structural information, a rational iterative medicinal chemistry program was initiated, aimed at increasing the number of inhibitor Á/enzyme interactions. A very potent and specific inhibitor, PTX042695, with an IC50 of 6 nM against E.coli PPAT, but with no activity against porcine PPAT, was obtained. ´ # 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

1. Introduction In the last decade, the emergence of both vancomycin and methicillin resistant bacteria has led to an urgent search for novel classes of antibiotics and new antimicrobial targets. Coenzyme A (CoA) is the predominant acyl group carrier in all living cells, and is required for many metabolic processes including the citric acid cycle and the synthesis of fatty acids [1]. CoA is exclusively synthesised from pantothenate, cysteine and ATP in five enzymatic steps [2,3]. Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) catalyses the penultimate step in the CoA biosynthesis pathway by transferring an adenylyl group from ATP to 4?-phosphopantetheine (4-PP), yielding dephospho-CoA and pyrophosphate (Scheme 1). The essentiality of the PPAT gene in Escherichia coli has been shown by a gene knock out experiment [4].

PPAT is thus a validated antibacterial target as inhibition will reduce the intracellular levels of CoA and prevent bacterial growth. Unlike bacterial PPATs, which are monofunctional hexameric enzymes, mammalian PPAT is a dimeric enzyme and occurs as a bifunctional complex with dephospho-CoA kinase [5,6]. Comparison of PPAT sequences from different bacterial species revealed highly homology, and suggested that the selective inhibition of bacterial PPATs would be an effective therapeutic strategy for the development of new, broad spectrum antibacterial agents. We initiated the program by synthesising a substrate-based dipeptide library as potential inhibitors of E. coli PPAT, since parallel array synthesis and purification techniques would allow for the rapid exploration of structureactivity relationships. In addition, the existence of a high resolution crystal structure of E. coli PPAT complexed with 4-PP previously solved in house enabled us to target the essential substrate-binding residues */a strategy designed to minimise the development of facile target-based drug resistance in any antibacterial compound.

2. Results and discussion

2.3. Structure-based drug design A number of selective hits were discovered from this library. Of these, compound 6 (PTX040334) had an IC50 of 0.30 mM against E.coli PPAT, but was inactive against porcine PPAT (Fig. 1). This inhibitor was subsequently co-crystallised with E. coli PPAT. In the crystal structure, the binding conformation of compound 6 is very close to the modelled global minimum conformation, with the peptide backbone and phosphoserine side-chain of 6 occupying a similar position to the corresponding groups in the substrate 4-PP (Fig. 2a). The crucial interactions with the highly conserved protein residues are conserved by the phosphate (T10, R88, Y98) and the C-terminal carbonyl (M74) of 6, as identified in 4-PP/E.coli PPAT crystal structure. The Fmoc group fits snugly into a lipophilic cavity at the surface of two protein subunits, and the D -alanine side chain partially occupies a polar cavity which can be explored for extra H-bonding interactions. To improve the drug-likeness of the inhibitor, the phosphoserine in 6 was first successfully replaced by a glutamic acid at the AA2 position; this analogue had a similar IC50 as 6. Then an analogue with D -serine as the replacement for D -alanine at the AA1 position (7, PTX007011) was prepared by solution phase chemistry. This had an improved IC50 of 0.12 mM. 7 was also cocrystallised with E.coli PPAT (Figs. 1 and 2b). The

2.1. Chemistry A dipeptide library (300 member) was designed based on the 4-PP structure, aiming at retaining the important interactions made by 4-PP, while allowing structure variations (Scheme 2). The synthesis of this combinatorial library was performed by solid phase chemistry using IRORI autotag-100 system. Starting from Sieber amide resin, the desired amine 1 was prepared by reductive amination in four steps. Two subsequent peptide coupling reactions gave dipeptide 3. After the removal of the Fmoc group, and acylation with R4 groups, the molecules were cleaved from the resin to give the desired dipeptides 5 (Scheme 3). All the members of the library were analysed by LC/MS for purity and confirmation of structure.

2.2. Biochemistry The library was screened against E. coli PPAT using a pyrophosphate release assay [7]. IC50 values of the active compounds were determined, and their selectivity measured by a counterscreen with porcine PPAT.

crystal structure of 7/E. coli PPAT showed that the serine side chain hydroxyl was present in two distinct conformations, implying that a bidentate ligand would improve the potency. The relative positions of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors within the binding pocket suggested that an imidazole ring on that position would be able to maximise favourable interactions. This compound (8, PTX042695) was synthesised and had an IC50 of 6 nM against E.coli PPAT (Table 1). The crystal structure of 8/E. coli PPAT (not shown) confirmed that the predicted interactions had been made. Based on the structural information, a follow-up library (700 member) was designed with the aim to

improve the potency by increasing the number of enzyme Á/inhibitor interactions. In addition to replacing the D -Serine with a bidentate ligand in AA1, a further consideration was to replace Fmoc with a chemically stable group with reduced molecular weight and log P . A selection of phenyls bearing polar substituents was investigated as potential Fmoc replacements in an effort to make extra H-bonding interactions with specific amino acids lining the Fmoc pocket. In particular, a glutamate side-chain carboxyl E134 and a serine sidechain hydroxyl S130 were targeted. The library synthesis was performed as described in Scheme 3. 2.4. SAR studies Clear structure-activity relationships were deduced from the library. Small branched alkyl groups were best for R1. D -Amino acids or b-alanine were required for AA1 and decreasing potency was observed in the

following order: D -histidine!/D -serine !/D -alanine 0/ b-alanine. For AA2, both the t-butyl esters of the carboxylate side-chains and the corresponding amides were inactive, since negatively charged groups are required to make interactions with protein residues R88, T10, K42 or Y98. Fmoc remained the best substituent at R4, although some other fused tricyclic ring systems, such as phenothiazine derivatives, were also potent (Table 1). Two of the most potent compounds are shown in Fig. 3 along with a moderately active compound (11) in which the Fmoc group was replaced by a more polar substituent. The crystal structure of 11 in complex with E. coli PPAT was also solved which is useful for further modifications on non-Fmoc containing inhibitors. These compounds were not anti-bacterial, possibly because they lack the ability to penetrate the bacterial cell wall, or because of metabolism.

3. Conclusion By using structure-based drug design and parallel synthesis, potent E. coli PPAT inhibitors were rapidly discovered, demonstrating the value of combining crystal structure information with parallel synthesis in lead optimisation. Enzyme Á/inhibitor co-crystal structures enabled essential substrate-contacting residues to be targeted, and two cycles of iterative design led to the discovery of a 6 nM inhibitor. A pharmacophore model developed from the crystal structure enabled identification of non-peptide inhibitors by virtual screening.
