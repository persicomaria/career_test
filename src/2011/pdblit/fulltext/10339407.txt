Anomalous Signal of Solvent Bromides used for Phasing of Lysozyme
Zbigniew Dauter* and Miroslawa Dauter
National Cancer Institute, Frederick and Brookhaven National Laboratory, NSLS Building 725A-X9, Upton NY, 11973, USA The anomalous signal of bromide ions, present in the crystal structure of tetragonal hen egg-white lysozyme through the substitution of NaCl by NaBr in the crystallization medium, was used for phasing of X-ray data Ê collected to 1.7 A resolution with a wavelength near the absorption edge of bromine. Phasing of a single wavelength data set, based purely on anomalous df HH contribution, led to easily interpretable electron density, equivalent to the complete multiwavelength anonalous dispersion phasing based on four-wavelength data. The classic small-structure direct methods program SHELXS run against all anomalous differences gave a successful solution of six highest peaks corresponding to six bromide Ê ions in the structure with data limited up to a resolution of 3.5 A. InterÊ pretable maps were obtained at a resolution up to 3.0 A using programs MLPHARE and DM. Bromide ions occupy well ordered positions at the protein surface. Phasing based on the single wavelength signal of anomalous scatterers introduced into the ordered solvent shell can be proposed as a tool for solving structures of well diffracting crystals.

Introduction
Two sources of information are typically used to identify the heavy atoms or anomalous scatterers in crystals: the dispersive differences, based on the df H contribution or anomalous differences resulting from the df HH signal. To utilize the dispersive differences two data sets are necessary, either with and without heavy atoms, as in the classic isomorphous replacement approach, or at two different wavelengths, as in the MAD technique. In contrast, the anomalous differences are estimated from a single data set collected at one wavelength. Characteristics of these two kinds of data are somewhat different. If measured from two crystals, dispersive differences can be affected by non-isomorphism. Scaling of two data sets also presents a non-trivial problem. The anomalous data collected from one crystal are only available for acentric re¯ections. In both types of data only large differences are meaningful; small differences may result either from cancellation of vector contributions of several scatAbbreviations used: MAD, multiwavelength anoualous dispersion; HEWL, hen egg-white lysozyme; ARP, ; CFOM, combined ®gure-of-merit; SAD,.

terers or from the anomalous (or heavy atom) phase being close (or orthogonal) to the protein phase for a given re¯ection. This means that only strong differences are useful for the identi®cation of heavy or anomalous scatterer sites. In the direct methods approach this is ful®lled automatically, since they use the subset of largest normalized structure factors; however, those ®gures of merit which are based on weak re¯ections are useless. Bromine is a very convenient anomalous scatÊ terer with its K absorption edge at 0.920 A. It is the most popular atom used for MAD phasing of DNA and RNA after incorporation of bromouracil instead of thymine. Similarly, selenium is widely used for MAD phasing of proteins based on selenomethionine, with its absorption edge at Ê 0.9795 A. These two elements lie next to each other in the periodic table and have 34 (Se) and 35 (Br) electrons. Both of them have anomalous corrections df HH of about four electrons and df H about À10 electrons beyond the edge, as estimated by the program CROSSEC (Cromer, 1983); the white lines may be a little higher. The use of Br and Se for MAD is often complicated because many sites are typically occupied by these atoms in macromolecules-methionine accounts for up to 5 % of amino acids in proteins and thymine about 25 % of bases in nucleic acids. This makes the interpretation of

However, in recent years considerable progress has been achieved in the application of direct methods for solving the multi-site anomalous scatterer substructures in macromolecules. Classic direct methods programs like MULTAN or SHELXS were shown to be of use (Mukherjee et al., 1989) but the algorithms based on the Shake-n-Bake approach applied in SnB (Miller et al., 1994) and SHELXM (Sheldrick, 1997) have proven to be most successful (Smith et al., 1998; Dauter et al., 1999). Phasing of macromolecular structures based purely on the anomalous differences is not widely used in crystallographic practice, but several examples have been published. In their classic work Hendrickson & Teeter (1981) utilized the anomalous signal to identify six sulfur atoms in the structure of crambin and subsequently to solve its structure. One of the most recent examples is the solution of rusticyanin based on the anomalous signal of the single copper atom in the native protein structure (Harvey et al., 1998). Lysozyme is one of the most thoroughly studied protein crystal structures, since its ®rst solution in the laboratory of D.C. Phillips (Blake et al., 1967). Its most common crystal form, in the space group P43212, grows in the presence of NaCl, and in the early studies one of the solvent sites was identi®ed as chloride on the basis of its high electron-density. Several anion binding sites were identi®ed in different crystal forms of HEWL. In the triclinic form nitrate and acetate sites were found (Walsh et al., 1998); in the monoclinic form three nitrate ions per molecule of HEWL were identi®ed (Rao & Sundaralingam, 1996). More halide ion sites were found in the HEWL structures re®ned at higher resolution on the basis of electron density. In monoclinic HEWL 17 iodide atoms are positioned around two enzyme molecules in the asymmetric unit (Steinrauf, 1998). In tetragonal HEWL four bromide sites were recently described (Lim et al.,

1998). In our recent analysis of anomalous scatterers present in tetragonal HEWL crystallized from NaCl solution eight chloride sites were identi®ed on the basis of anomalous difference Fourier synthesis (Dauter et al., 1999). The presence of halide binding sites in lysozyme has prompted us to study the feasibility of estimating the protein phases employing the anomalous scattering of bromide ions present in the solvent and bound at the surface of the protein. We compared the phasing results obtained by using four wavelengths for data to that using a purely anomalous signal from a single wavelength data set.

Results and Discussion
Incorporation of anomalous scatterers into crystals of lysozyme was straightforward and involved substitution of NaCl by NaBr in the crystallization solution. From this modi®ed solution crystals appeared as readily as from the standard NaClcontaining solution. Some of them tended to adopt the prismatic shape with most prominent {110} faces instead of the usually dominating {111} habit. Nevertheless all of them were in the expected space group P43212. The crystal used for data Ê collection had cell dimensions a  78.60 A, Ê . The MAD diffraction data were c  37.20 A collected using four wavelengths in the vicinity of the bromine absorption edge and the results are summarized in Table 1. The crystal stayed in arbitrary orientation during data collection and no attempt was made to use the inverse beam technique. The data were collected by the standard single wavelength approach, changing the wavelength after each data set had been ®nished. However, high data quality was ensured by high multiplicity of measurements; each Friedel mate was, on average, recorded about four times.

Figure 1. The jÁFanomj/F ratio for four data sets as a function of resolution.

Figure 1 shows the ÁFanom/F ratio as a function of resolution for four data sets. The expected strength of an anomalous signal is given by the formula (Hendrickson & Teeter, 1981):
1a2 1a2 ÁFaF  21a2 NA df HH aNP Zeff 

where NA is the number of anomalous scatterers (here six bromine ions with an df HH value of 3.8 at the short wavelength side of the absorption edge) and NP is the number of protein atoms (1001 in lysozyme) with the average scattering of Zeff of 6.7 electrons. According to this formula the expected ÁF/F ratio for Lyso10 data is 0.054. Figure 1 shows that the anomalous signal in Lyso10 is close Ê to that value in resolution ranges lower that 2 A. At higher resolution the noise in both ÁF and F increases their ratio. As expected, the anomalous signal is smaller in Lyso11 (corresponding to the in¯ection point of the EXAFS spectrum) and negligible in Lyso12 and Lyso13 data. The Lyso13 data set having a minimal anomalous signal was used to re®ne the lysozyme model. As a starting model the 8LYS coordinate set (Blake et al., 1967) was used. All solvent water molecules were removed and the solvent structure was builtup automatically by ARP on the basis of electrondensity maps calculated using weights from the maximum likelihood re®nement program REFMAC. At the early stage of re®nement the phases and anomalous differences in the Lyso10 data were used to calculate the anomalous difference map (ÁFanom, jcalc À 90  ), which clearly showed six peaks at the surface of the protein (Figure 2). The positions of those peaks corresponded to six of the eight chloride ions identi®ed in the structure of the tetragonal lysozyme (Dauter et al., 1999) and contained the four bromide sites found earlier (Lim et al., 1998). The presence of bromide ions in only six out of eight halide sites occupied by chloride

atoms in the structure of HEWL crystallized from NaCl (Dauter et al., 1999) is a consequence of the different concentration of halide ions in the crystallization solution and differences in the ionic radii and coordination properties between BrÀ and ClÀ ions. The six bromide ions were included in the re®nement of the Lyso13 model. B factors of some bromide ions re®ned to rather high values; this may re¯ect partial occupancies in the structure. Those bromide ions showed a lower signal in the anomalous difference map. The re®nement converged with an R factor of 21 % and Rfree of 29 %. All anomalous differences within the data set Lyso10 were used in SHELXS without any discrimination, and the program was run with default parameters for 1000 phase sets ®ve times with different resolution cut-offs: 1.7, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and Ê 3.5 A. Table 2A shows the frequency of resulting phase sets in ranges of combined ®gure-of-merit Ê (CFOM). Up to a resolution of 3.0 A there is a clear contrast between successfully phased sets with CFOM < 0.14 and the majority of phase sets leadÊ ing to wrong solutions. At 3.5 A there is no contrast, but still the phase set with the lowest CFOM gave a correct solution in terms of six bromide peaks, albeit less accurately positioned. Table 2B lists peaks in the best solution at each resolution. There is a clear correlation between the peak height and the B factor of the corresponding bromine atom resulting from the re®nement of the lysozyme model, except for the pair Br204 and Br205, which consistently showed higher E-map density for the atom with the higher B factor. The six bromide sites identi®ed from the E-map were input to MLPHARE for re®nement of their parameters and evaluation of protein phases. At Ê each resolution (1.7, 2.0, 2.5 3.0 and 3.5 A) two trials were performed, one using all four wavelength data sets and the other using only Lyso10

mode for 20 cycles. Results of phasing are summarized in Table 3. Judging by ®gure-of-merit the results of 4-l MLPHARE are considerably better than 1-l. At this stage the additional dispersive signal improves the phasing process considerably. However, density modi®cation is so powerful that it levels off the quality of output phase sets. There is very little difference in the quality criteria of the DM phases. Indeed, map correlation and average (jDM À jjCALC) phase difference is no worse for 1-l phasing than for 4-l (as seen in Figure 3(a) and (b). Ê In general, up to a resolution of 3.0 A the resulting electron-density maps were interpretable and at 1.7 Ê and 2.0 A their quality was outstanding, clearly showing almost all amino acid side-chains. Figure 3 illustrates the electron density for a region of the protein resulting from phasing at different resolution. These results show that the density modi®cation procedure becomes more powerful with increasing Ê resolution. Beyond 2 A it is capable of producing phase sets differing, on average, from the ``true'' phases by about 40  , leading to high quality electron-density maps even if the starting phases are relatively inaccurate.

Conclusions
Anomalous scatterers diffused in the solvent regions of macromolecular crystals have been used for evaluation of phases at low resolution, e.g. for the estimation of the protein envelope (Fourme et al., 1995). If such atoms or ions adopt de®nite places at the protein surface, like bromide ions in the crystal structure of lysozyme, they can be successfully utilized for phasing of re¯ections at high resolution, leading to the solution of crystal structure via MAD or SAD methods. In the crystallization of macromolecules the frequently used reagents, such as chlorides, sulfates, and salts of calcium or sodium, can be replaced by heavier analogues, like bromides, selenates, salts of strontium or rubidium. Those elements have easily accessible X-ray absorption edges with about four anomalous electrons per atom; with several such scatterers present in the crystal structure they may provide suf®cient phasing power to solve the unknown structures.

The solvent atoms, even in the ®rst hydration shell, usually have somewhat higher temperature factors than most of protein atoms, hampering the phasing power of such anomalous scatterers. On the other hand, selenomethionine residues also often display high mobility or disorder. It can be expected that methods of phasing based on incorporation of anomalous scatterers within the solvent will gain popularity thanks to the minimal technical complications involved. Solvent anomalous scatterers should only negligibly perturb the structure of the protein, much less than the incorporation of heavy atoms or even substitution of sulfur by selenium in methionine residues. The phasing and phase modi®cation algorithms implemented in several available programs have become so powerful that it may often be suf®cient to collect only one wavelength data set containing maximized anomalous signal instead of several wavelength data sets, as in the MAD approach. If a crystal diffracts strongly enough, it may be more bene®cial to enhance the quality of the data increasing the multiplicity of measurements by collecting more images rather than collecting less redundant data at several wavelengths. In addition, such an approach alleviates the need to use precisely selected wavelength points on the ¯uorescence spectrum, it is enough to maximize the df HH signal at the low-wavelength side of the absorption edge.

Materials and Methods
Lysozyme from Sigma was crystallized in hanging drops. The crystallization solution consisted of 15 mg/ ml of protein, 0.5 M NaBr in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.6) and the well solution was 1 M NaBr in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer. For X-ray data collection a crystal was transferred for a few seconds to the mother liquor containing in addition 30 % (v/v) glycerol and quickly frozen in the stream of cold nitrogen gas at 100 K in the ®ber loop. A single crystal specimen was used for collecting data at four wavelengths near the bromine Ka absorption edge at the beamline X9B at NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory. The Mar345 imaging plate scanner was used in its 180 mm and 150 mm pixel mode. The crystal was rotated approximately about its (101) axis. Two passes Ê were performed for each wavelength, ®rst at 1.7 A with 1  rotation and two minutes exposure and second at

Ê 2.7 A with 1.5  rotation and 20 second exposure per image. Each pass consisted of about 90  of total rotation. All four data sets were more than 99.5 % complete. The intensities were integrated, scaled and merged with the HKL2000 system (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) equipped with the graphics interface. Intensities were transformed into amplitudes using TRUNCATE (French & Wilson, 1978). The data collection is summarized in Table 1. All measured anomalous differences from the Lyso10 data set having a maximal df HH contribution were used for solving the partial structure of anomalous scatterers by the classic direct methods program SHELXS (Sheldrick, 1986) at different resolution cut-off limits. All subsequent calculations were done using programs from the CCP4 suite (CCP4, 1994). The four data sets were put on a common scale by SCALEIT and all phasing trials were performed by MLPHARE (Otwinowski, 1991), and the density modi®cation program DM (Cowtan, 1994) used in the ``combine & omit'' mode. The solvent content was set to 40 %, employing the solvent ¯attening and histogram matching options, with all re¯ections included in all phase re®nement cycles. The data set Lyso13, with a minimal df HH contribution was used to re®ne the lysozyme model to obtain ®nal phases for comparison with those calculated by different phasing options. The re®nement was performed with REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) combined with a selection of solvent water molecules by ARP (Lamzin & Wilson, 1997). For inspection of electron-density maps the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego) was used as well as for producing electrondensity Figures.
