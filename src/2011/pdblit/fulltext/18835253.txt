Beta-2 microglobulin (b2m) is the light chain of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I). b2m is an intrinsically amyloidogenic protein that can assemble into amyloid fibrils in a concentration dependent manner. b2m is accumulated in serum of haemodialysed patients, and deposited in the skeletal joints, causing dialysis related amyloidosis. Recent reports suggested that the loop comprised between b2m strands D and E is crucial for protein stability and for b2m propensity to aggregate as cross-b structured fibrils. In particular, the role of Trp60 for b2m stability has been highlighted by showing that the Trp60 ? Gly b2m mutant is more thermo-stable and less prone to aggregation than the wild type protein. On the contrary the Asp59 ? Pro b2m mutant shows lower Tm and stronger tendency to fibril aggregation. To further analyse such properties, the Trp60 ? Val b2m mutant has been expressed and purified; the propensity to fibrillar aggregation and the folding stability have been assessed, and the X-ray crystal structure determined to 1.8 Å resolution. The W60V mutant structural features are discussed, focusing on the roles of the DE loop and of residue 60 in relation to b2m structure and its amyloid aggregation trends. Ó 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Beta-2 microglobulin (b2m) is a 99 amino acid protein building the light chain of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) and of CD1 [1]. b2m has the typical immunoglobin b-sandwich fold, consisting of seven b-strands organised in two b-sheets linked by a core disulphide bond [2]. Under physiological conditions b2m is normally degraded in the kidney, however in patients with kidney failure b2m tends to accumulate in the blood, up to concentrations 20­30 times higher than normal. Under such high concentrations b2m forms amyloid fibrils and aggregates that are massively deposited in skeletal joints, seriously affecting their functionality, a pathology known as dialysis related amyloidosis (DRA) [3]. Amyloid or cross-b fibrils arise from the aggregation of misfolded protein molecules into elongated protein fibrils. During fibrillation the protein molecules lose their native fold, increase their b secondary structure content, and, via intermolecular bstrand interactions, polymerise into elongated amyloid fibrils [4].

To date, the fine molecular details of fibril formation and fibril structure are only marginally understood [4]. Over the past few years numerous efforts have been focused on studying the structural bases and mechanisms of b2m fibril formation, since b2m is regarded as a molecular model for folding and for amyloid aggregation processes (for review [5]). Aromatic residues on b2m strand E have been shown to increase amyloid propensity [6]. In particular, increasing attention has been focused on Trp60 that plays a key role in fibrillogenesis [7­9]. Trp60 is exposed in the native b2m fold, and NMR H/D exchange experiments show that it is also solvent accessible in the fibrils [10]. In a recent report, Trp60 was substituted by Gly, showing that W60G b2m mutant is more resistant to unfolding than the w.t. protein, and is not fibrillogenic at pH 7.4 under mild conditions [7]. It was proposed that W60G higher stability may partly result from structural relaxation of the DE loop, relative to w.t. b2m; moreover it was suggested that the removal of the bulky hydrophobic Trp side chain may also increase the solubility of isolated b2m and decrease its tendency to aggregation [7]. The presence of a Pro residue in the DE loop (Asp58 ? Pro), which likely makes the DE loop more geometrically strained, results in a lower Tm and higher tendency to beta aggregation [9]. Moreover, a W60C b2m mutant is as stable as the w.t. b2m, but shows lower tendency to form fibrils. In order to characterise more deeply the role of geometric strain and hydrophobicity in the b2m DE loop, here we report the production, the fibrillogenic

process and the crystal structure of the W60V b2m mutant. Starting from the crystal structures of DE loop mutants and of w.t. b2m, some general observations on the role of DE loop and in particular of residue 60 are drawn. Materials and methods Mutagenesis. Mutagenesis of Trp60 into Val, and the subsequent expression and purification of W60V b2m mutant, have been carried out as previously reported [7]. Amyloid fibril formation. b2m amyloid aggregation has been carried out following two different protocols. pH 7.4 procedure: 100 lM b2m was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mM phosphate buffer, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, in the presence of 20% (v/v) TFE [11]. b2m fibril seeds (20 lg/ml) were added to the samples to start the fibrillogenesis. pH 2.5 procedure: 100 lM b2m was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mM Na-citrate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 2.5, in the presence of 20 lg/ml of b2m fibril seeds [12]. Amyloid formation was quantitatively assessed using Thioflavin T (ThT), according to LeVine [13]. ThT (SIGMA) concentration was 10 lM, in 50 mM glycine/ NaOH buffer, pH 8.5. Fluorescence measurements were carried out by excitation at 445 nm, and emission collected at 485 nm. The fibrillogenesis of w.t. b2m and the W60V mutant was measured after three days of incubation at 37 °C. Determination of fold stability. The thermodynamic stability was determined by monitoring the dependence of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence on guanidinium chloride (GdmHCl) concentration. Excitation was applied at 280 nm and emission monitored in the range 285­500 nm, using slit widths of 5 nm. The protein concentration of all samples was 0.02 mg/ml in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with GdnHCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 4.8 M. Fluorescence spectra were obtained using a Perkin Elmer LS50 spectrofluorimeter at 303 K. Experimental data were converted to the unfolded fraction using the general equation fU = (y À yN)/(yU À yN), where y is the value of the spectroscopic parameter observed at a given denaturant concentration, and yN and yU are the same values for the native and unfolded protein, respectively, extrapolated from the pre- and post-transition base lines defined by a nonlinear least square fitting procedure. The free energy of unfolding in the absence of the denaturant, DG°(H2O), and the denaturant concentration at the midpoint of the unfolding transition, Cm, were calculated according to the linear fitting model assuming a two-state transition. Crystallisation and structure determination. b2m W60V mutant was crystallised under the same conditions used for b2m W60G [7]. In order to obtain crystals of diffracting quality microseeding

was performed; the use of filtered protein solutions (22 lm cutoff) was crucial for the growth of useful single crystals. X-ray diffraction data were collected using the crystallization mother liquor (19­20% PEG 4000, 20% glycerol, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, 0.1 M MES pH 6.0) as cryoprotectant at beam line ID14-1, at 100 K (ESRF, Grenoble). Diffraction data were processed using MOSFLM and SCALA [14,15]. b2m W60V structure solution was achieved by molecular replacement, using PHASER [16] and the b2m W60G mutant atomic coordinates (PDB entry 2Z9T) as search model. The structure was then refined with REFMAC5, at 1.8 Å resolution, applying the maximum likelihood residual, anisotropic scaling, bulk-solvent correction, and atomic displacement parameter refinement using the `tls' method [17]. Model building and structure analysis was performed with COOT [18]. Fig. 2 have been prepared using CCP4MG [19] and Pymol (http://pymol.sourceforge.net). Ramachandran plot analysis and Fig. 3 have been carried out using MolProbity [20]. The structure with PDB code 2BSS has been used as example of b2m in the MHC I complex [21]. Atomic coordinates and structure factors for the b2m W60V have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, with accession codes 3EKC. Results and discussion Amyloid fibril formation The W60V b2m mutant has been tested for its tendency to betaaggregation. W60V readily aggregates resulting in a high yield of fibrils at low pH (pH 2.5, see Materials and methods), while at neutral pH W60V aggregates with lower efficiency (Fig. 1), thus closely resembling the aggregation properties observed for the W60C mutant [9]. The reduced tendency to form fibrils at pH 7.4 of the W60V and W60C mutants, compared to those of w.t. b2m, is in keeping with the recently shown relevance for beta-aggregation of the aromatic residues in the DE region [6]. The properties observed for W60V confirm that the W60C aggregation trends previously reported were not an artefact related to a limited characterisation of the monomer-dimer transition in that mutant [9]. Folding stability The mutation of Trp60 to Val does not change the overall b2m folding stability, as determined by guanidium hydrochloride unfolding (Fig. 2); w.t. b2m and W60V mutant show same midpoint denaturant concentration (Cm = 1.8 M GdnHCl) and unfolding

Crystal structure of W60V b2m mutant The structure of W60V mutant has been solved and refined to 1.8 Å resolution, with R-work and R-free values of 18.4% and 24.0%, respectively (see Table 1). As expected, the W60V b2m mutant displays the b-sandwich fold observed in all other b2m structures (Fig. 3A). All 100 amino acids are unequivocally traced in the electron density; good electron density is available for Val60. The DE loop has a conformation identical to that observed in the W60G and W60C mutants. Conversely, the AB loop, although traceable, displays poorer electron density relative to the rest of the structure. The 25­80 disulphide bond presents a double conformation, a feature not previously observed in the other reported DE loop mutants [7­9] Although the overall W60V fold is very similar to that of monomeric w.t. b2m [22], detailed structural comparisons show that W60V is mostly similar to the W60G mutant (RMSD 0.19 Å for 100 Ca) that displays the same conformation for the DE loop (Fig. 3B). Structural comparison of W60V vs. monomeric w.t. b2m yields instead a slightly higher RMSD (0.40 Å for 100 Ca), due to a different conformation of the DE loop (Fig. 3B). As observed in W60C and D59P mutants [9], the DE loop conformation is dependent on the presence/absence of the bulky Trp60 side chain. DE loop conformation The W60F, W60G, W60C and W60V mutants show the same DE loop conformation adopted by w.t. b2m in the MHC I complex, despite a displacement of the loop tip of 3 Å (Fig. 3B). In such conformation of the DE loop, Trp60 adopts a backbone conformation (U, W: 95°, 5°) that is unfavourable for any residue other than Gly (Fig. 4). Very recently a hexameric b2m structure has been reported and proposed to be the first step of b2m amyloid aggregation [23]. Also in this case, the DE loop adopts the conformation observed in the MHC I complex and in the W60 mutants, however in the hexameric b2m the DE loop displacement is enhanced compared to the W60 mutants (Fig. 3B). In the hexamer, the Ca of Lys58 at the apex of the DE loop moves 6.5 Å from the position observed for b2m in the MHC I complex, and 3.5 Å from the position

found in the W60 mutants. Interestingly, such DE loop rotation brings Trp60 side chain to a stacking interaction with Phe56, which is one of the novel intramolecular interactions found in the hexameric b2m [23]. These observations suggest that the DE loop conformation observed in b2m W60V mutant, in all other W60 mutants, in b2m w.t. (MHC I), and hexameric b2m represents its natural conformation in the native and in the pre-amyloid fold. Conversely, in monomeric w.t. b2m and in the D59P mutant, the DE loop has a different conformation, where Trp60 flips on the opposite side of the DE loop (Figs. 3b and 4). However, such conformation is due neither to crystal contacts nor to Trp60 steric hindrance. It is noteworthy that in parallel to Trp60 flipping, the (U, W) angles move to more acceptable values in the Ramachandran plot (À100°, 30°). On the other hand, together with such conformational stabilisation, Ser57 moves from the Ramachandran plot area typical of beta structures (U, W: À110°, 180°) to the generously allowed region (U, W: À100°, À80°) (Fig. 4). However, in both the DE

loop conformations (one in the W60 mutants, in MHC I, and in hexameric b2m; the other in monomeric w.t. b2m and in the D59P mutant) either residue 60 or 57 fall in an unfavourable area of the Ramachandran plot, indicating the continuous presence of some backbone strain in the DE loop. The correlation between the presence of a residue in the generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot and b2m stability is noteworthy: w.t. b2m together with W60C/V mutants show the same pattern in the Ramachandran plot and show the same fold stability (this report and [9]). On the contrary the W60G mutant has all DE loop residues in the Ramachandran allowed region and shows a clearly higher fold stability [7]. Role of residue 60 during amyloid aggregation In hexameric b2m, which shows how b2m can oligomerise and aggregate, Trp60 establishes stacking interactions with Phe56. Therefore, every b2m mutant missing an aromatic residue at position 60 would lack the stabilising p­p stacking interaction during the conversion from the native fold to the amyloid aggregate. Such

consideration is in keeping with the experimental results: both Trp and Phe at position 60 can successfully establish p­p stacking interactions, and indeed w.t. b2m and W60F readily aggregate into amyloid fibrils [8]. When Trp60 is substituted with a hydrophobic non-aromatic residue (i.e. Val or Cys), van der Waals interactions can somehow stabilise the intermediate, but experimentally the tendency to amyloid aggregation clearly decreases [9]. The Trp60 ? Gly mutation, instead, not only abolishes all hydrophobic interactions with Phe56 but also leaves an empty volume, which likely destabilises b2m intermolecular interactions observed in the hexamer. These evidences point to a crucial role that Trp60, together with Phe56 and the other neighbouring aromatic residues (residues Phe62, Tyr66, Tyr67, Phe70), may play as promoters of the transition from a native, or grossly native, fold to amyloid aggregate. This interpretation is supported not only by the experimentally determined tendency to b-aggregation at pH 7.4 (w.t. b2m and W60F > W60V/C > W60G), but also by previous reports on hexameric b2m, and by mutational analysis of b2m aromatic residues in the E region [6,23] The W60V mutant and w.t. b2m show the same folding stability but the W60V mutant has lower tendency to amyloid aggregation at pH 7.4, suggesting that the differences in aggregation behaviour described here and elsewhere [7,9] are not (only) due to an increase/decrease in protein stability. On the contrary, mutations at position 60 lead to opposite effects relative to amyloid formation at pH 2.5. At low pH, both W60G and W60V are more prone to beta-aggregation than w.t. b2m. This phenomenon is so far unexplained, but it may be related to the adoption of different paths during amyloid aggregation at physiological and at low pH [24,25]. Strand D conformation Given the increasing number of mutants and w.t. b2m structures currently available, further analysis of strand D conformation is now possible. Trinh et al. suggested that the regularisation of strand D (i.e. removal of a b-bulge at residue Asp53), observed in b2m crystallised alone, was part of the b2m reorganisation towards amyloid aggregation [22]. W60V and all other DE loop mutants crystallised to date, show a straight D strand, regardless of the specific tendency of each mutant to aggregate. Conversely, the oligomeric b2m, presents a b-bulge at Asp53 [23]. Strand D is reported to be very flexible in solution [7], hence it can easily assume different conformations (b-bulge vs. regular strand) depending on the crystal contacts that Asp53 can establish. Inspection of PDB crystal structures shows that b-bulge at Asp53 is found in MHC I, in hexameric b2m and in the H31Y mutant. In all these cases Asp53 interacts with an adjacent molecule and the b-bulge

is stabilised by intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Nevertheless, b2m is not prone to amyloid aggregation when complexed in MHC I, the H31Y mutant is not amyloidogenic, and hexameric b2m is held to be part of the amyloid aggregation path. Moreover, starting from the W60G mutant, which does not form fibrils under mild conditions, up to the D59P mutant, which is very prone to beta-aggregation, all DE loop mutants do not present a b-bulge on strand D. All these data together strongly suggest that the presence/absence of a b-bulge on Asp53 does not relate in any way to the beta-aggregation properties of the crystallised variant. In fact it appears simply an evidence of strand D structural adaptability to a minimum energy conformation according to the distinct crystal packing environment.
