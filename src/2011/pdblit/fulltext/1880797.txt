Abstract A solution study on the complex ability of galactaric acid (GalaH2) for complexation with Ca2 + , Mg2 + and Zn2 + ions is reported. The stability constants of the complex species are determined by means of potentiometric measurements. From the dependence of stability constants on temperature, the DH° and DS° values are also determined. The formation of the complex species is an endothermic process and DH° and DS° values suggest a chelate coordination mode of galactaric acid involving carboxylic oxygen and a-hydroxylic group. The prevailing species at acidic or neutral pH is [MGala] (M=Ca2 + , Mg2 + , Zn2 + ) which is also isolated in the solid state and characterised by means of IR spectroscopy. On increasing pH, the [MGalaH - 1]- species is also formed, where the coordinated OH group undergoes deprotonation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Carbohydrate complexes with metal ions generally have a very low stability in aqueous solution, owing to the poor donor ability of hydroxylic oxygen atoms. Introduction of an anchoring group into a sugar molecule as a primary coordination site may promote the coordination and deprotonation of the alcoholic hydroxylic groups of the carbohydrate moiety. The complex forming ability is enhanced by several orders of magnitude, even in acidic or neutral solutions.1 Among carbohydrate derivatives, sugar acids are of great interest because their metal ions complexes are

largely present in biological media.2 Zinc saccharide complexes have been shown to influence the activity of some Zn2 + enzymes and were investigated as preventive agents against lead intoxication in rats,3 while Zn2 + hyaluronic acid complex has been patented and used as a medicine for treatment of ulcers.4 The ability of Ca2 + to form strong gels in the presence of alginic acid is related to the interaction of calcium ions with the a-glucuronic residues of alginic acid.5 Many structural studies have demonstrated that, in the solid state, the interaction of sugar acids with metal ions involves both the carboxylic oxygen and the a-hydroxylic group. The crystal and molecular structure of Ca2 + and Mg2 + -galactarate,6,7 Ca2 + -glucarate,8 Ca2 + -lactobionate and gluconate9 has been reported. The structure of Zn2 + -hyaluronate

was also obtained by EXAFS10 and shown to give a tetracoordination of Zn2 + ion involving the carboxylic oxygen and the pyranosidic oxygen. However the existence of such crystalline adducts does not constitute evidence that complex formation occurs also in solution. A large number of solution studies on transition metal ions complexation by sugar acids are reported,1 while few data regarding Mg2 + , Ca2 + and Zn2 + are available. Group II metals were widely studied interacting with simple sugars,11 although the stability constants of the complex species were small and their accurate determination difficult. Here we report a thermodynamic solution study on the ability of galactaric acid (GalaH2) for complexation with Ca2 + , Mg2 + and Zn2 + ions. Previous investigations on coordination behaviour of GalaH2 towards Cu2 + ascertained the involvement of a-hydroxylic oxygen in metal coordination also in aqueous solution, on the basis of thermodynamic and spectroscopic data.12 2. Results and discussion The protonation constants of the ligand at different temperature are reported in Table 1 together with the DH° and DS° values, calculated from the dependence of protonation constants on temperature, according to the integrated van't Hoff equation.13 DS° DH° + 2.3RT 2.3R The protonation reaction of carboxylic acids is usually an endothermic process, owing to ionic species desolvation upon protonation; on the contrary, the formation of intra-molecular hydrogen bonds involving hydroxylic groups makes the protonation reaction of hydroxycarboxylic acids an exothermic process,14 as it is shown from the negative DH° of Log i= -

GalaH2. The positive DS° value, which denotes an increased disorder of the system, is attributed to the desolvation of the carboxylic anion upon protonation. Our values are similar to those found for tartaric acid15 and other hydroxycarboxylic acids.14 The pH­metric titration curves of the M2 + containing systems (Fig. 1), in all metal to ligand molar ratios investigated, showed two equivalent points and the amount of NaOH spent to reach each equivalent point is represented by the equations: mNaOH =2mL mNaOH =2mL +mM where m is the number of moles, L is GalaH2 and M is the metal ion. The first equivalent point (pH 6) is consistent with the formation of the neutral [MGala] species, while the second (pH 8) is attributed to the formation of [MGalaH - 1]- species. The stability constants of the complexes are reported in Table 2 together with the calculated thermo-

dynamic parameters DH° and DS°. In the [MGala] species, it is suggested that the metal ion is coordinated by carboxylic and alpha-hydroxylic oxygens, as observed in the crystal structure of Ca- and Mg-galactarate.6,7 The existence of a chelate complex also in solution is supported by thermodynamic considerations: 1. From a comparison of the stability constants of various M2 + -carboxylate and M2 + -hydroxocarboxylate complexes reported in Table 3, it can be seen that the stability constant of the complex species is lower if the ligand is monodentate like 1, 2 and 3, and is higher if the ligand is a bidentate chelate like 4­7; the value found for galactaric acid is nearer to those of the second type of ligands, suggesting a chelate coordination mode for galactaric acid. 2. Also the DH° value is in line with this coordination behaviour. The complexation reaction is usually an endothermic process, but when the ligand acts as a bidentate chelate, a diminution in the DH° value is observed.17,18 In fact the DH° value for Zn2 + -acetate (5.26 kcal mol - 1) is greater than that of Zn2 + -malonate (3.10 kcal mol - 1),13 where the dicarboxylic acid chelates the Zn2 + ion. The DH° value of Zn2 + -galactarate (3.8 kcal mol - 1) is in line with the formation of a chelate complex. 3. Positive values of DS° are associated with an increased disorder because of solvent removal from ionic species. These values increase on metal chelation and, in our case, are nearer to those found for M2 + malonate complexes (M=Mg, DS° =24 cal mol - 1 K - 1,16 M=Zn2 + , DS°= 28 cal

mol - 1 K - 113), therefore suggesting for GalaH2 the involvement of a hydroxylic group in metal chelation in aqueous solution. A comparison of ligating ability of galactaric acid toward Ca2 + with respect to other sugars is reported in Table 4. The results show that the [CaGala] species is more stable than the corresponding [CaL]+ complex where L is an aldonic acid such as gluconic or lactic, despite the higher acidity of GalaH2 (log K1 = 3.05(2)) with respect to gluconic acid (log K1 =3.47).23 This difference may be attributed to the electroneutrality of the complex and to the ability of GalaH2 to form polymeric structures, as observed in the crystal structure of the [CuGala(bpy)]n ·2n H2O complex.12 The [CaGala] species was also more stable than [CaL]+, with L=alduronic acid; in fact these acids were found to coordinate the metal ion through the ethereal oxygen, as their cyclic structure disfavours the

a-hydroxylic oxygen.18,24 Neutral sugars, such as arabinose or ribose, were found to form complexes with Ca2 + of low stability whilst with Mg2 + , these sugars give rise to very weak non-specific interactions.21,22 The order of stability of [MGala] complexes is Cu2 + \Zn2 + \Ca2 + ]Mg2 + (similar to glucuronic and galacturonic acids for Cu2 + 12 and Ca2 + 23). Other authors have previously observed a diminution in pH by adding bivalent metal ions to an alginic acid containing solution, finding the order of metal2 + affinity Pb\Cu\Cd\Ba\Sr\ Ca\Co, Ni, Zn, Mn\Mg.25 The species distribution curves for Mg2 + and Zn2 + complexes are reported in Fig. 2 (Scheme 1). The prevailing species at acidic pH were [MGala] (M=Zn2 + or Mg2 + ) and [Mg(Gala)2]2 - while the formation of the corresponding Zn2 + complex was prevented by the lower coordination number (usually four) of Zn2 + complexes26 ­ 28 with respect to Mg2 + and Ca2 + which were found to coordinate six or eight oxygen atoms, respectively, in the crystal structure of galactaric salts.6,7 The formation of the [MGalaH - 1]- species, on increasing pH, may be explained by two different hypothesis: (1) deprotonation of the coordinated a-OH group; (2) substitution of the sugar OH group by a hydroxide ion, resulting in the formation of mixed-hydroxo complexes. The carbohydrate and their derivatives are very weak acids; the first protonation constant lies in the range log K=12­14,29 but in presence of metal ions, sugars become more acids. The presence of copper ion was found to lower the pK value of the coordinated a-hydroxylic group deprotonation to form

stable chelate (COO-, O-) complexes with galactaric acid12 and with other sugar acids30 or amine sugars.31 The positive DH° value found for the reaction M2 + +Gala2 - ? [MGalaH - 1] - +H+ suggested the dissociation of coordinated ahydroxylic group, rather than the metal coordination of OH- group which is always an exothermic process.16 The solid complexes [MGala]·x H2O (x=2 with M=Ca2 + or Mg2 + , x=4 with M= Zn2 + ) were synthesised and characterised by means of elemental analysis and IR spectroscopy. The more relevant IR bands and their tentative assignment are reported in Table 5. In the IR spectrum of the free galactaric acid, a very strong band is present at 3287 cm - 1 which was assigned to the strongly hydrogen bonded OH groups,32 as shown in the crystal structure of GalaH212 (O···O dis, tance 2.747(4) A). Upon metal complexation, the OH stretching vibration showed shifting

and broadening; this shift toward higher frequencies was due to the general weakening of the strong sugar hydrogen bond system upon acid metalation33 as observed in the crystal structure of the Ca2 + - and Mg2 + -galactarate salts;6,7 while the presence of an intense band below 3200 cm - 1 is attributed to the OH stretching vibration of the bonded water molecules. Similarly a shoulder band around 1690 cm - 1, in the spectra of Ca2 + and Mg2 + salts, which is not present in the uncomplexed sugar and in the Zn2 + complex, is also assigned to the bending mode of the coordinate water molecules. The carbonyl stretching vibration observed in GalaH2 at 1719 cm - 1 disappeared in the

metal2 + complexes and two additional absorption bands were observed around 1600 and 1430 cm - 1, these bands were assigned to the antisymmetric and symmetric OCO- stretching vibrations, respectively. The separation (188 cm - 1) of the two OCO- components observed in the IR spectra of Zn2 + and Mg2 + complexes is indicative of a unidentate mode of carboxylic group, in agreement with the structural analysis of the Mg2 + salt;6,7 while in the sodium and potassium galactarate, the carboxylic group acts as bridging bidentate.34 Other absorption bands in the 1454­1118 cm - 1 range, in the spectrum of the free sugar, relating mainly to the bending vibrations of

the COH and CCH groups,35 showed considerable intensity changes and shifting towards lower frequencies, upon sugar metalation. The changes observed for the COH bending vibrations are consistent with the participation of the sugar OH groups in metal­ligand bonding and the alteration of the sugar hydrogen bonds network. In the same way the stretching vibration of the C O groups36 which appears as strong absorption bands in the 1100­ 900 cm - 1 region, exhibited spectral changes (shifting and diminishing in intensity) on sugar salts formation. The similarity in the IR spectra for the three ion complexes suggested for all the same coordination mode of galactaric acid was found in the crystal structure of Ca2 + and Mg2 + salts.6,7 It may be concluded that the binding mode of galactaric acid toward metal2 + ions is the same: it acted as a chelate ligand through the monodentate carboxylic group and the a-hydroxylic oxygen. This coordination mode was also maintained in aqueous solution and the complex species found were more stable with respect to those of aldonic or alduronic acids, owing to the great symmetry of galactaric acid molecule which allows the formation of polymeric species as observed in the crystal structure of the solid complexes.6,7,12 On increasing the pH, the deprotonation of the coordinated a-hydroxylic group leads to the formation of stable complexes at a pH value (pH\5 for Cu2 + , pH\7 for Zn2 + , Ca2 + and Mg2 + ) significantly lower than that of metal complexes with alduronic acids (pH\10 for Ca2 + ).20

metal­ligand molar ratios, the metal concentration was 5×10 - 4 M, the pH range investigated was 3­10. Potentiometric measurements were performed at 15, 25, 35 and 45 °C using a fully automated ORION 960 Autochemistry system, following the general procedures previously reported.12 A constant ionic strength 0.1 M (solid NaNO3) and an N2 atmosphere were maintained in all experiments. The stability constants (ipqr ), which are defined by Eqs. (1) and (2), where M is the metal, L is the ligand in the dianionic form and H is the proton, were refined by least-squares calculations using computer program SUPERQUAD,37 taking into account the presence of M(OH)2 species:15 pM +rL+sHlMp Lr Hs iprs =[Mp Lr Hs ]/[M]p[L]r[H]s (1) (2)

3. Experimental Potentiometry. --A GalaH2 aqueous solution (3× 10 - 3 M) was standardised by titration with NaOH and the protonation constants were determined at different temperatures (15, 25, 35 and 45 °C). The concentration of the stock solutions of M2 + nitrate hydrate (C. Erba) (M2 + =Ca2 + , Mg2 + , Zn2 + ) was determined with EDTA. The starting solution for each titration was prepared by addition of known volumes of M(NO3)2 and GalaH2 solutions in the 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4

Preparation of compounds. --[MGala]·x H2O (x=4 for M=Zn2 + ; x=2 for M= Ca2 + and Mg2 + ). An aqueous solution of M2 + acetate hydrate was added under continuous stirring to 50 mL of an hot aq solution (0.02 M) of galactaric acid at pH 4. The pH was kept constant by adding small amounts of concd aq NaOH. Solid compounds were rapidly separated. [ZnGala]·4 H2O: Anal. Calcd for C6H16O12Zn (345.5): C, 20.84; H, 4.67.
