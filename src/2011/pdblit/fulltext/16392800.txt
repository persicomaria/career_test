Thiolactomycin inhibits bacterial cell growth through inhibition of the -ketoacyl-ACP synthase activity of type II fatty acid synthases. The effect of modifications of the 5-position isoprenoid side chain on both IC50 and MIC were determined. Synthesis and screening of a structurally diverse set of 5-position analogues revealed very little tolerance for substitution in purified enzyme assays, but a few analogues retained MIC, presumably through another target. Even subtle modifications such as reducing one or both double bonds of the diene were not tolerated. The only permissible structural modifications were removal of the isoprene methyl group or addition of a methyl group to the terminus. Cocrystallization of these two inhibitors with the condensing enzyme from Escherichia coli revealed that they retained the TLM binding mode at the active site with reduced affinity. These results suggest a strict requirement for a conjugated, planar side chain inserting within the condensing enzyme active site.
Introduction Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is one of the most deadly infectious diseases, infecting more than 8 million and killing more than 2 million people each year.1 Multidrug-resistant strains of TB and co-infection with HIV have made treating TB even more difficult. The most widely used TB therapy is a combination of isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol.2,3 Even such four-drug regimens still require treatment times of at least 6 months, decreasing TB patient compliance. New TB therapies are desperately needed that will shorten the treatment period and combat multidrug-resistant TB. Cell wall biosynthesis is a proven broad-spectrum antibacterial drug target that has been historically very efficacious.4 In the treatment of TB in particular two of the four agents that constitute front-line therapy (isoniazid and ethambutol) target different aspects of cell wall biosynthesis. Although recent analysis suggests that interrupting cell wall synthesis may have little potential to significantly shorten the duration of therapy, new agents active against cell wall targets may offer valuable therapeutic options for the management of cases of drug-resistant disease.5 Thiolactomycin (TLM, 1) is a thiotetronic acidcontaining natural product that inhibits bacterial and plant type

II fatty acid synthases (FASII), which provide essential building blocks for bacterial cell walls.6-8 Although fatty acid synthases are also present in higher eukaryotes, these type I systems are structurally distinct, and the presence of a 3-position methyl group on thiotetronic acids has been shown to confer high selectivity for type II over type I systems.9 TLM exerts its effect via inhibition of the -ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS), key condensing enzymes involved in chain elongation in FASII.10-12 The core thiotetronic acid structure is believed to mimic the transition state adopted by the thiomalonate intermediate in chain elongation. But there are more subtle specific interactions, since even closely related condensing enzymes such as FabH, which initiates chain formation from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-ACP, are only weakly inhibited by TLM and are not physiologically relevant targets for the antibiotic.13-15 In Mtb, for example, TLM inhibits KasA and KasB, two KAS enzymes that are components of the specialized FASII system involved in synthesis of the very long-chain meromycolic acids (ca. C50), but is only a weak inhibitor of the initiating condensing enzyme mtFabH.11,16 TLM has only modest activity against laboratory strains of Mtb, but it retains this activity against several strains of Mtb that are resistant to other drugs.11,17

TLM has several characteristics that make it an attractive lead molecule for TB.18 It has low toxicity in mice,19 low molecular weight (MW ) 210 g/mol), high water solubility, and drugappropriate lipophilicity (log P ) 3). TLM is well absorbed orally and has shown chemotherapeutic efficacy against Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a mouse infection model.19 Thus, derivatization of TLM to improve potency for various pathogens has been the focus of many recent investiga-

tions. For reasons of synthetic accessibility, the 5-position of the molecule has received the most attention. Many groups have reported a wide variety of substitutions at the 5-position and evaluated whole-cell activity against plants, malaria, trypanosomes, and livestock pathogens, or have reported activity in complex, partially purified fatty acid synthase systems with varying degrees of success.10,20,21 5-Position analogues have been reported with improvement in MIC against whole cells of Mtb over TLM, but no attempt was made to measure IC50 against the relevant condensing enzymes and to correlate it to MIC.11 Other reports have shown that 5-biphenyl or 5-acetylenic analogues of TLM were able to inhibit the related Mtb FabH; however, no Mtb MIC values were provided, and FabH is not essential in Mtb, suggesting these would not be expected to have whole-cell potency.16,22,23 Because nearly all of these studies fail to report IC50 values against the relevant purified condensing enzymes, evaluation of the resulting structureactivity relationship (SAR) has been impossible. Moreover, the presence of multiple condensing enzymes, including both type I and type II in addition to condensing enzymes present to produce essential polyketide components of the cell envelope of Mtb, has made it especially difficult to interpret the wide variety of structures that have been produced. The Escherichia coli model system has been instrumental in elucidating the mechanism of action of TLM. The FabB condensing enzyme appears to be the relevant physiological target since cells that overexpress FabB, but not FabH, are resistant to TLM.13 Likewise, cells of Mtb that overexpress KasA acquire TLM resistance.24 In addition, selection of drugresistant E. coli has shown that the F390V mutation in FabB confers TLM resistance.15 The cocrystal structure of TLM bound to E. coli FabB provides a detailed view of how this molecule interacts with the active site.12 TLM binds to the malonyl-ACP side of the active site with the 2-position carbonyl oxygen of TLM forming tight hydrogen bonds with His-298 and His-333.

The 4-position hydroxyl group forms hydrogen bonds with a series of water molecules which in turn interact with the backbone of the polypeptide chain. These water molecules lie within the portion of FabB that forms the binding site for acyl carrier protein-bound phosphopantetheine. The sulfur atom of the thiolactone does not make any specific contacts but lies adjacent to the active site cysteine. The isoprene side chain of TLM slips into a narrow lipophilic pocket between two peptide bonds, and this conjugated aliphatic chain interacts with the peptide via tight van der Waals interactions. A hydrophobic pocket opens up beyond the isoprene binding slot, an observation that led to an early conclusion that this binding site is not "optimally" filled by TLM and that hydrophobic 5-position analogues may improve the binding affinity. To attempt to improve the binding of the TLM isoprene side chain, we began to explore the SAR of the 5-position of TLM for the condensing enzymes of the type II FAS system. Chemistry Synthetic routes to both racemic and chiral TLM have been reported.25-27 3,5-Dimethylthiotetronic acid (2) was prepared using the method of Wang and Salvino.27 Using a method similar to that previously reported,28 the dianion of 2 was generated using LiHMDS at 0 °C (Scheme 1). Subsequent addition of alkyl or aryl halides gave racemic 5-substituted TLM derivatives (3-31) in moderate to good yields (30-90%). In cases in which the isolated purity was below 80% (by LC/MS), the compound was purified by flash chromatography. In general, bulky halides or alkyl and aryl chlorides afforded lower yields. The compounds were made in parallel using the Radley's carousel reaction system. In all, 77 compounds were prepared by this method and were examined for biological activity. Compounds 3-31 are a representative set. (For a complete list, see Supporting Information.) To investigate the relative importance of each double bond in the isoprenoid side chain, compounds 32 and 33, where each double bond was reduced individually, as well as compound 34, the fully saturated analogue, were prepared. Chiral compounds 32-34 were prepared from fermentation-derived TLM, preserving the stereochemistry of the 5-position.

While catalytic hydrogenation attempts using either 5% Pd/C or 5% Rh/Al2O3 gave only trace amounts of 32 or 34, an excess of diimide29 from NH2NH2,H2O and 30% H2O2 (aq) generated these two compounds readily from TLM (Scheme 2). To obtain compound 33, the terminal double bond of the TLM isoprene side chain was first masked. Hydroboration of TLM with 9-BBN and subsequent oxidation were used to produce terminal alcohol 35 in 88% yield.30 The internal double bond of 35 was then reduced with an excess of diimide, resulting in compound 36. Mesylation using MsCl and Et3N then furnished dimesylate 37 in modest yield.31 Unfortunately, attempted elimination of mesylate 37 with DBU in toluene under reflux did not afford the desired terminal double bond of 33 but instead generated two compounds having the same molecular weight as 33 but that were far less polar than the desired target molecule.32 Functional group transformation from mesylate 37 to iodide was successful using NaI in acetone to afford compound 38 in 66% yield.33 Dehydroiodination and C4-mesylate deprotection of 38 were accomplished in one pot using an excess of t-BuOK (20 equiv) in CH2Cl2 to give compound 33 in 50% yield.34 Use of fewer equivalents or slow addition of t-BuOK led to the same nonpolar compounds as above, most likely by intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the demesylated C4-oxygen onto the 5-position side chain. Several other elimination attempts such as DBU, TBAF, and t-BuOK in THF gave similar results. The diastereomers of compounds 33 and 36-38 were not separated. To investigate the importance of the methyl branch on the isoprene side chain, the simple butadiene analogue of TLM (i.e., desmethyl-TLM, 47) was prepared (Scheme 3). The racemic 5-position aldehyde was selected as the initial step from 3,5dimethlythiotetronic acid 2, anticipating that simple olefination would afford the desired butadiene. However, direct formylation of 2 was unsuccessful; therefore, the dianion of 2 was treated with paraformaldehyde to afford the 5-hydroxymethyl compound 39.35 Unfortunately, several oxidation conditions (PCC, PDC, TPAP/NMO, Dess-Martin periodinane, and Swern oxidation) were unsuccessful at converting 39 to aldehyde 40.

Unsuccessful oxidation attempts of a primary alcohol at the 5-position of either tetronic or thiotetronic acid without first protecting the 4-hydroxyl group have been previously reported.26,36 Protection of the 4-hydroxyl group of 2 by treatment with MOMCl and DIPEA provided compound 41.37 5-Hydroxymethylation of 41 then furnished 42 in 78% yield.35 Oxidation of 42 using Dess-Martin periodinane gave the desired aldehyde 43 (43% from 2).38 When 43 was subjected to Horner olefination conditions using diethyl allylphosphonate,39 the reaction generated 41 as the major product via deformylation, in addition to trace amounts of the 5-diene analogue 46. From aldehyde 43, a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction with a stabilized ylide diethyl 2-oxopropylphosphonate, gave trans-enone 44 in 48% yield in addition to the deformylation product 41 (18%).39,40 The ketone of 44 was then successfully reduced with NaBH4 and CeCl3,7H2O to afford allyl alcohol 45 in 64% yield.41 Subsequent dehydration of 45 in the presence of the Burgess reagent42 furnished butadiene 46. A variety of conditions were employed to deprotect compound 46, most yielding only nonpolar products.32 The most successful condition was the very mild NaHSO4,SiO243 at room temperature. These conditions furnished the desired deprotected product 47 in 75% yield from compound 46. Finally, we prepared analogue 50, containing an additional methyl group at the terminus of the isoprenoid side chain of TLM (Scheme 4). The 4-position hydroxyl group of TLM was first protected using MOMCl to give compound 48 in nearly quantitative yield. Olefin cross-metathesis,44 using Grubbs' second generation catalyst in the presence of trans-2-butene, furnished (1E,3E)-diene 49 in good yield. The optimal deprotection condition for compound 49 was found to be polymerbound TsOH stirred with silica gel at room temperature.45 This condition yielded desired compound 50 in 75% yield.

to be evaluated were racemic, it was important to establish whether the presence of the opposite enantiomer of this series of molecules would antagonize activity of chiral TLM, isolated from fermentation of Nocardia sp. 2-200. Therefore, we evaluated the activity of racemic TLM (Sigma-Aldrich) in our biological assays. The IC50 of racemic TLM against E. coli FabB was 20 µM, exactly 2-fold higher than that of TLM (Figure 1A). This result indicates that the enantiomer of TLM is inactive and nonantagonistic, consistent with the crystal structure of the FabB-TLM complex in which the shape and hydrogen bonding network of the TLM binding pocket is only able to accommodate the natural stereoisomer. Similarly, the MIC of racemic TLM against E. coli strain ANS1 was 12 µM, 2-fold higher than that of TLM (Figure 1B). These results suggested that racemic TLM analogues would likely result in only an apparent 2-fold decrease in potency compared with TLM itself. Since our goal was to obtain enhanced inhibition of Mtb KasA and KasB, the activity of TLM was also measured in a KasA (or KasB) extension assay using palmitoyl-ACP (from E. coli) with [14C]malonyl-CoA in the presence of FabD and reduced ACP. Reaction products were reduced with NaBH4 and organic soluble radioactivity then provided a measure of enzyme activity. Using this assay, the IC50 of TLM for Mtb KasA and KasB was found to be 4 µM and 6 µM, respectively (Figure 1C). TLM showed little selectivity between the enzymes. Biological Activity of Structurally Diverse 5-Position Analogues of TLM. The biological assay results for compounds 3-31 are shown in Table 1. Enzyme inhibition assays were performed at 100 µM against E. coli FabB/H and Mtb KasA/B and FabH. When no inhibition was seen at 100 µM, the compound was not tested further for enzyme inhibitory activity. When the compound showed greater than 30% inhibition of the enzyme, a discrete IC50 was measured as shown in Figure 1. Inhibition between 0 and 30% was recorded as an IC50 value of >100 µM. The compounds were also evaluated in MIC assays against E. coli strain ANS1 and Mtb strain H37Rv. As a set, the simple 5-alkyl, alkenyl, and aryl substituted thiotetronic acid analogues lacked significant activity in the condensing enzyme assays. Straight-chain alkyl groups showed very modest activity against E. coli and Mtb FabH enzymes with longer aliphatic chains correlated with improved activity. A relationship between chain length and FabH activity was shown in compounds 4-9. Increasing chain length resulted in improved activity against Mtb FabH, with the maximal inhibition by compound 7 (C12). Longer chain lengths led to less activity against FabH. These compounds, however, were inactive against FabB, KasA, and KasB and did not have enhanced MIC values against Mtb. Likewise, they showed only modest MICs against E. coli. These data are consistent with the report that in Mtb FabH is not essential.23 In some cases, growth inhibition toward an organism (7, E. coli) did not necessarily translate into inhibition of a known condensing enzyme. One striking observation was that compound 14, corresponding to a simple saturated version of the racemic form of TLM

completely lacked activity. We were surprised to note that this comparatively simple modification abolished activity against the

with racemic compound 23, where the proximal double bond was reduced. The geranyl-substituted analogue 25 had low activity in all assays employed, which was also contrary to prior reports.11 Because of the lack of activity displayed by compounds 3-31, it became clear that the intact isoprene side chain of TLM was absolutely critical to its activity. Our focus then shifted to determining the precise structural features within the isoprene unit that were responsible for the binding of TLM. The Relative Importance of Each Olefin as a Binding Determinant of the Isoprene Side Chain. Using chiral, fermentation-derived TLM allowed us to systematically explore the contributions of each double bond in the TLM side chain independently using compounds 32-34. Racemic 47 allowed us to explore the contribution of the methyl branch in the isoprenoid side chain. The results of E. coli and M. tuberculosis -ketoacyl-ACP synthase activity assays and MIC determinations are shown in Table 2. Surprisingly, reduction of either double bond, independently or both together, completely ablated both enzyme inhibition and wholecell growth-inhibitory activity. Therefore, the presence of two conjugated double bonds adjacent to the thiolactone ring appears

to be a formal requirement of this mode of binding to the condensing enzyme active site. Compound 47, corresponding to the racemic desmethyl analogue of TLM, maintained full activity toward KasA (the measured IC50 is for the racemate, so presumably the correct enantiomer has an IC50 of half this concentration). Despite this potent activity against KasA, this molecule was totally inactive against FabB and KasB and lacked whole-cell MIC activity against both organisms as well. To extend our understanding of the structural requirements for binding beyond the essentiality of the conjugated diene, we also examined the effect of elongation of the side chain by addition of an extra methyl group to the terminus of the isoprenoid unit. The FabB-TLM cocrystal structure suggested that this should be tolerated because the binding pocket extends beyond the TLM side chain toward the interior of the protein.12 Compound 50, methyl-TLM, retains activity as an inhibitor of KasA only (Table 2). Compound 50 showed no activity against FabB or KasB, and, similar to desmethyl-TLM, did not show inhibition of growth of either organism. The compounds in Table 2 were also examined for their inhibitory effects against human FASI isolated from breast

These results correlate well with the recent report that the presence of a 3-position methyl group is a key structural determinant of the observed specificity for FASII compared with FASI.9 Molecular Modeling of TLM and Its Analogues. We employed a virtual docking strategy using the FlexX module within the Tripos drug discovery software suite to gain insights into how the shape and double-bond arrangement of the isoprenoid side chain might affect TLM binding affinity. To verify the validity of the approach, FlexX was first used to dock TLM into the FabB active site. FlexX was not able to dock TLM into the native FabB structure, but it did succeed in docking TLM into the FabB-TLM complex structure from which TLM had been removed. This implies that a small but significant conformational change occurs within the FabB active site upon TLM binding12 that is absolutely required for FlexX to reproduce the observed binding. Analogues lacking one or both double bonds (32, 33, 34) and desmethyl TLM (47) were docked to the FabB structure from which TLM had been extracted. ChemScore was used46 to rank the resulting solutions because it placed TLM at the top of the rankings when used as an internal control. In general, none of the analogues docked with scores comparable to that of native TLM. To achieve a

realistic docking result, it was necessary to lock the thiolactone ring within the active site according to the crystal structure. Generally, variants that contained the branch methyl group in the isoprene side chain were ranked higher than those lacking it, and the presence or absence of the isoprene double bonds were of secondary importance. Since this result is contrary to the observed biochemical outcome, it is apparent that FlexX significantly underestimates the importance of the van der Waals interactions of the conjugated diene system. Examination of the Binding Mode of Desmethyl- and Methyl-TLM with E. coli FabB. From the IC50 values of the compounds shown in Table 2, compounds 47 and 50 displayed a clear selectivity for KasA over KasB and FabB. To attempt to understand these differences and to verify that 47 and 50 bind to the active site in a similar mode as TLM, ligand binding was directly visualized using X-ray crystallography. Since KasA crystals remain elusive despite considerable effort, E. coli FabB was used for these studies even though the IC50 values suggested that this might be problematic. Cocrystallization was performed using a 3-fold molar excess of ligand, and data were collected for 47 and 50 at 2.2 and 2.3 Å, respectively. The structures were solved by molecular replacement and refined, and pertinent statistics for both FabB complexes are shown in Table 3. Electron density for both compounds was present in the cocrystal structures (Figure 3) but was significantly lower than the surrounding protein, indicating partial occupancy, as was expected from the IC50 values. To avoid model bias, the electron densities shown in Figure 3 correspond to simulated annealing omit maps in which the compounds were not included in the refinement. Despite the poor ligand electron densities, the placement of 47 and 50 in each active site was straightforward and unambiguous. By maintaining a constant ligand temperature factor during refinement corresponding to the average value of the active site residues, it was possible to estimate the ligand occupancies as 60% for 47 and 75% for 50. These two values are consistent with the relative quality of the ligand densities where that of 50 is clearly superior. The concentration of each compound which allowed for cocrystallization was only 2-fold above the IC50 value, but attempts to use higher concentrations to increase occupancy compromised crystallization. Compounds 47 and 50 dock into the active site in the same orientation as TLM. For comparison, the 47 and 50 active-site complexes are shown in Figure 3 (left and right panels, respectively) in the same orientation as the TLM complex shown

in Figure 2. Although FabB does not undergo any large conformational changes upon binding TLM, His298 and Phe392 have altered positions to accommodate the inhibitor,12 and this is also the case with compounds 47 and 50. The 50-fold loss in activity toward FabB of 47 and 50 relative to TLM is not easily understood from structural comparisons alone. However, two points are worth noting. Compound 47 does not contain the branch methyl group of TLM, and it may bind more weakly than TLM due to the loss of van der Waals interactions with residues Phe390 and Pro272. In the case of compound 50, the problem may be steric in nature. The extra methyl group extending distally from the isoprene group sits in a small cavity bounded by the backbone carbonyl oxygens of Asp268 and Ala271, and the amide nitrogen of Gly394. Using the SegMod algorithm,47 we have constructed homology models of KasA and KasB based on the FabB structure to identify any obvious differences in the active sites of the Mtb enzymes. The active sites are extremely similar, and the molecular basis for the selectivity of 47 and 50 for KasA is not immediately apparent. Conclusion This work suggests a conceptual shift is necessary for evaluating 5-position substitutions in the development of more effective TLM analogues for bacterial condensing enzymes. Far from being permissive to replacement and substitution, the isoprenoid side chain appears to be absolutely required to maintain activity against KasA, KasB, and FabB. Unfortunately, this side chain also provides one of the most serious obstacles to the exploration of analogues of this structural class because of the difficult synthetic accessibility of this moiety. Despite the appearance of several reports in the literature suggesting that significant substitutions in this position would be tolerated, we found that selective removal of either double bond of TLM resulted in a dramatic drop in the ability of this molecule to inhibit the elongation catalyzed by the condensing enzyme reaction and the resulting growth-inhibitory activity of the analogue. Derivatives that had improved activity against whole cells were obtained, but the effect on whole cells did not correlate with inhibition of enzyme activity, suggesting that the mode of action of these molecules does not involve these specific condensing enzymes. Compound 7, for example, had an MIC against E. coli of 25 µM, but has no activity against FabB, the known TLM target. We observe weak activity of compound 7 against FabH, but the IC50 of 100 µM is higher than the MIC, ruling out FabH as the likely cellular target unless significant accumulation occurs in vivo. Furthermore, compound 7 has a lower IC50 against Mtb FabH compared with TLM; however, 7 does not inhibit Mtb in vivo, a result congruent with the nonessentiality of this gene.23 These data demonstrate that the activity of such TLM analogues against Mtb cannot be casually ascribed to inhibition of the mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway without solid biochemical corroboration. This result is perhaps not too surprising since TLM is thought to act as a transitionstate mimic for the -ketoacyl-ACP synthase elongation enzymes, and there are no fewer than six essential enzymes that catalyze this reaction in Mtb.23 Analogues of TLM with appreciable Mtb MICs and without KasA or KasB activity may well inhibit another condensation enzyme, or they may interact with a different target altogether. This complexity dramatically reduces the utility of developing an SAR based upon simple whole-cell activity for any analogues of this class of molecules. Although space-filling models of the active site suggested that larger hydrophobic molecules may fit in the cavity beyond

the slot occupied by the isoprene unit, our data show that the presence of the planar, conjugated diene structure of the side chain within that slot is critical for high affinity binding. The narrow opening occupied by this side chain in the active site favors a planar geometry that predetermines the position of the entire side chain relative to the thiolactone ring. The cocrystal structure clearly reveals the rigidity of the pocket and the extremely tight fit of the isoprenoid unit (Figure 2). It is clear that the presence of a conjugated diene at the 5-position of TLM, structurally and stereochemically, cannot be altered while retaining binding mode and activity against the elongation condensing enzymes. One intriguing finding from this study is the differential activity of compounds 47 and 50 against various condensing enzymes. From these two examples, it would appear that inhibition of mtKasA alone is not sufficient for killing the whole organism, despite strong genetic evidence that this enzyme is essential for viability. The most likely possibility is that these two compounds are effluxed or metabolized more efficiently. The disparity between the IC50 of TLM (4 µM) and the MIC (63 µM) suggests that penetration, metabolism, or efflux play a role in determining the susceptibility of Mtb to this agent. The other possibility is that KasB compensates for the loss of elongating activity of KasA. This possibility seems less likely since the biological substrates for these two enzymes are very different, KasA operating to extend palmitoyl-CoA to products that are approximately C40, while KasB extends the products of KasA to products of an average size of C54.48 Both enzymes are capable, however, of extension of shorter acyl-CoAs, so this possibility cannot be excluded. These results support the notion that TLM analogues must be evaluated with respect to both their activity in terms of IC50 against a specific condensing enzyme as well as in terms of growth-inhibitory potential to avoid confusing SAR resulting from effects on multiple enzyme targets. The tight fit of the isoprenoid side chain to a narrow groove adjacent to the enzyme active site of KasA, KasB, and FabB drastically limits the ability to simplify TLM to a simple thiotetronic acid skeleton upon which variation may be induced. Because of the synthetic complexity introduced by the chiral conjugated diene at the 5-position, future efforts at semisynthetic analogues at the 4-position enol, which extends in the direction of the binding tunnel for the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group, may be a profitable area for exploration. Experimental Section
Anhydrous solvents and reagents were purchased from SigmaAldrich and used as received unless otherwise stated. Melting points were obtained on an Electrothermal 9100 apparatus and are uncorrected. LC/MS analysis was conducted on an Agilent 1100 series HPLC with attached Agilent quadrupole mass analyzer model G1946 D SL with electrospray ionization in positive ion mode.

General Procedure for Compounds 3-31. At 0 °C and under an argon atmosphere, LiHMDS (1 M in THF, 4 mmol) was added to a stirring solution of 3,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-5H-thiophen-2-one (2) (0.25 g, 1.73 mmol) in anhydrous THF (6 mL). The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at 0 °C for 30 min during which time the mixture turned from clear to opaque yellow. The alkyl halide (1.73 mmol) in anhydrous THF (10 mL) was added, and the reaction mixture was allowed to come to room temperature overnight. Saturated NH4Cl (aq) solution was added to quench the reaction, and the mixture was extracted between H2O and EtOAc (3 × 25 mL). The combined EtOAc layers were dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated in vacuo to yield the crude product. Reaction products less than 80% pure (by LC/MS) were purified by column chromatography. All compounds with purity above 80% were characterized by mass spectrometry and 1H NMR and assayed for biological activity. Yields and spectral data are given for selected compounds.

concentrations. Enzymatic activity of the reactions treated with the solvent was used as controls. ecFabH Assay. The coupled assay of FabH, as described previously,51 contained 25 µM ACP, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, 65 µM malonyl-CoA, 45 µM [1-14C]-acetyl-CoA (specific activity 60 µCi/µmol), 1 µg of purified FabD, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and 10 ng of FabH protein in a final volume of 40 µL. The FabD protein was present to generate the malonyl-ACP substrate for the reaction. The ACP, -mercaptoethanol, and buffer were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min to ensure the complete reduction of ACP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of FabH. After incubation of the sample at 37 °C for 15 min, 35 µL of reaction mixture was removed and dispensed onto a paper filter disk (Whatman No. 3MM filter paper). The disk was washed successively with ice cold 10, 5, and 1% trichloroacetic acid with 20 min for each wash and 20 mL of wash solution per disk. The filter disks were dried and counted for 14C-isotope in 3 mL of scintillation fluid. mtFabH Assays. The filter disk assay developed for ecFabH51 was modified to measure the activity of mtFabH with [1-14C]lauroyl-CoA (specific activity, 55 µCi/µmol). The assays contained 50 µM ACP, 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, 50 µM malonyl-CoA, 12.5 µM [1-14C]-lauroyl-CoA, 1 µg E. coli FabD and 40 ng of mtFabH in a final volume of 40 µL. ACP, -mercaptoethanol, and the buffer was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to ensure complete reduction of ACP before the remaining components (except mtFabH) were added. The mixture was then aliquoted into the assay tubes, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of mtFabH. After incubation at 37 °C for 40 min, 35 µL of the reaction mixture was removed and deposited on a Whatman DE-81 filter disk. The disks were washed three times (20 min for each wash, 20 mL wash solution for each disk) with ice-cold chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (2:5:3, v/v/v) containing 0.2 M LiCl. The filters were dried and 14C-isotope was counted in 3 mL of scintillation fluid. ecFabB, KasA and KasB Assay. The condensation assay was essentially the same as described previously.15 Briefly, condensing enzyme assays contained 45 µM acyl-ACP (myristoyl-ACP for ecFabB, palmitoyl-ACP for KasA and KasB), 50 µM [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 52 µCi/µmol), 100 µM ACP, 1 µg of FabD and condensing enzyme (25 ng of ecFabB, 500 ng of KasA, or 500 ng of KasB) in a final volume of 20 µL. ACP was reduced by 0.3 mM DTT before the other reaction components were added. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme. After incubation of the sample at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 0.4 mL of the reducing reagent containing 0.1 M K2HPO4, 0.4 M KCl, 30% tetrahydrofuran, and 5 mg/mL NaBH4. The reaction contents were vigorously mixed after the addition of the reducing reagent and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min before being extracted into 0.4 mL toluene. The 14C-isotope in the upper phase was quantitated by scintillation counting. M. tuberculosis MIC Assay. A stock culture of M. tuberculosis H37Rv was grown to OD 0.5 in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80, 0.2% glycerol and albumin/ NaCl/glucose (ADC) complex. The culture was diluted 1:1000 in 7H9-based medium before aliquoting 50 µL into each well of a 96-well plate. The inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO to make stock solutions of 50 µmol/mL. Inhibitors were added to the first row of wells of the 96-well plate with 100 µL 7H9-based medium. After pipet mixing and using a multichannel pipet, 50 µL was removed from each well in the first row and added to the second row. 2-Fold dilution in this manner was carried out to give eight dilutions of each inhibitor (1000 µM-7.8 µM). The plates were incubated for 2 weeks at 37 °C and were read macroscopically using an inverted plate reader. Each measurement was made three independent times. E. coli MIC Assay. Strain ANS1 (metB1 relA1 spoT1 gyrA216 tolC::Tn10 - r F-) was defective in TolC-dependent efflux pumps and was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations.15 The MICs of the test compounds against E. coli strain ANS1 were determined by a broth microdilution method. ANS1 was grown to

mid-log phase in 1% tryptone broth and then diluted 30 000-fold in the same medium. A 10 µL aliquot of the diluted cell suspension (3000 to 5000 colony forming units) was used to inoculate each well of a 96-well plate (U-bottom with low evaporation lid) containing 100 µL of tryptone broth with the indicated concentration of inhibitors. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 20 h before being read with a Fusion Universal Microplate analyzer (Packard, Canada) at 600 nm. The absorbance was normalized to the solvent treated control which was considered as 100%. Crystallization and Data Measurement. N-terminal His-tagged FabB was expressed, purified, and crystallized as previously described.12 For cocrystallization, 14 mg/mL of protein was incubated with 1 mM of compound 47 or 50, and drops were set up at 18 °C over a well solution containing 1.9 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, and 2% PEG 400. For compound 47, X-ray data were measured with a Bruker-Nonius CCD, integrated with SAINT (Bruker AXS), and scaled using PROSCALE (Bruker AXS). For compound 50, data were measured at the Southeastern Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) beamline 22ID at the Advanced Photon Source, integrated using MOSFLM52 and scaled using SCALA.53 Model Building and Refinement. Both 47-FabB and 50-FabB structures were solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe.54 The protein model from the known TLM-FabB crystal complex (PDB code 1FJ4) was used as the search model. Iterative rounds of model building using O55 and refinement using REFMAC56 were performed. CNS-1.157 was used for the B-factor and occupancy refinements.
