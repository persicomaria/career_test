ABSTRACT The solution structure of the complex between the transcription factor PhoB DNA-binding/transactivation domain and DNA was determined by NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing in a periodic boundary box of explicit water with the particle mesh Ewald method. The refined structures provided better convergence and better local geometry compared with the structures determined in vacuum. The hydrogen bond interactions between the PhoB domain and DNA in the aqueous environment were fully formed. The complex structure was found to be very similar to the crystal structure, particularly at the PhoBDNA interface, much more so than expected from the vacuum structure. These results indicate the importance of the proper treatment of electrostatic and hydration influences in describing protein-DNA interactions. The hydration structures observed for the refined structures contained most of the crystal waters as a subset. We observed that various water-mediated PhoB-DNA interactions contributed to the molecular recognition between PhoB and DNA.

INTRODUCTION Protein-DNA recognition is governed mainly by electrostatic interactions.1 This immediately implies that the water environment plays an important role in mediating protein-DNA interactions by screening the bare Coulombic interactions.2 Nevertheless, in the conventional procedure for NMR structure refinement, restrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed in vacuum, with reduced or no electrostatic interactions.3 Such a refinement method cannot be expected to adequately take into consideration the effects of the ionic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between the surface atoms in the protein and those in the DNA. Recently, NMR refinement methods have been improved by adopting a more elaborate model for electrostatic interactions and the solvent environment, that is, the combined use of distance geometry and the latest simulation techniques.4≠9 Linge et al. carried out NMR refinement with appropriate treatment of electrostatic interactions in an explicit water environment.4 Chen et al. used the generalized Born model to model the water environment for NMR refinement.5,6 Both methods succeeded in improving local protein geometry relative to the geometry refined in vacuum. A number of NMR structures refined with explicit solvents already exist in the DRESS7 and RECOORD databases.8 However, the NMR structure of a protein-DNA complex has not yet been refined in the hydrated condition. In the present study, we assessed whether the explicit solvent model improves the NMR structure of a protein-DNA complex. In addition, in the process of NMR structure refinement, we identified water-mediated interactions between the protein and DNA. Water-mediated interactions between protein and DNA play an important role in determining the stability and specificity of proteinDNA recognition.2 Analyses of the crystal structures of protein-DNA complexes have revealed a number of interfacial water molecules linking the protein and DNA, which highlights the significant contributions of the water-mediated interactions to the molecular recognition process.10≠14 Here, we attempted to identify water-mediated interactions in the process of NMR structure refinement. Since direct experimental observation of hydrated water molecules is difficult, the interactions were identified in the process of NMR structure refineGrant sponsors: Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of Japan (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research); Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (the Protein 3000 project--a national project on protein structural and functional analyses) *Correspondence to: Akinori Kidera, International Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Yokohama City University, Yokohama 230-0045, Japan.

ment so as to satisfy the distance restraints as well as the energetic criteria. The confidence level associated with the interactions thus determined can be evaluated using the number of occurrences over many refinements and also by agreement with the water molecules observed in the crystal structure. The system for NMR structural determination was a DNA complex of the PhoB DNA-binding/transactivation domain, with an isolated form of the PhoB DNA-binding domain as a reference. PhoB is a transcription activator that is involved in the regulation of 39 genes constituting the pho regulon of bacteria.15,16 The PhoB protein comprises two functional domains, the regulatory/phosphorylated domain (1≠124) and the DNA-binding/transactivation domain (131≠229).17 Although binding to DNA is regulated by phosphorylation at the N-terminal domain by PhoR,18 it is the DNA-binding domain that has specific binding affinity to the DNA target sequence, the pho box.19 The NMR structure of the DNA-free form of the PhoB DNA-binding domain was solved by Okamura et al. (PDB: 1QQI)20 and the crystal structures of the DNA-bound and free-forms were solved by Blanco et al. (PDB: 1GXP and 1GXQ, respectively).17 The DNA-binding domain of PhoB belongs to the OmpR-PhoB family, consisting of an N-terminal four-stranded b-sheet and a winged helix motif. It was reported that the long loop between the second and third helices is responsible for the interaction with RNA polymerase.21 In the DNA-bound form, two PhoB DNA-binding domains bind in tandem to the pho box. However, a single chain of the PhoB DNAbinding domain is also able to bind to one of the binding sites in the pho box.20 The solution structure determined here is for the singlet form composed of the complex, comprising a single protein domain and a single binding site. Differences between the singlet solution structure and the tandem crystal structure will also be discussed here. In this paper, we present the refined solution structures of the DNA complex form and the isolated form of the PhoB DNA-binding/transactivation domain. These structures have improvements in structural quality relative to the structures refined in vacuum. Then, we present the hydration structure of the DNA complex, in which water-mediated interactions were observed between PhoB and DNA with a high level of confidence. METHODS
NMR spectroscopy

The DNA component of the complex comprised a 16-mer double-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide, 50 ACTGTCATAAATCTGT-30 , which was present in approximately equal proportions to the protein. The sample solution contains 1.0≠2.0 mM DNA-PhoB complex in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) in H2O/2H2O (9/1) or 2H2O. NMR experiments were carried out at 310 K, using either a Bruker DRX-500 or DRX-600 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance gradient probe. Data were processed and analyzed by using nmrPipe,22 nmrWish, and PIPP23 software. The 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments of the complex are described by Okamura et al.20 The 1H resonance assignments of the DNA in the complex were performed with 2D NOESY, TOCSY, and DQF-COSY experiments with a 13C- or 13 15 C/ N-filtered pulse scheme. Distance restraints within the protein, within the DNA, and between the protein and DNA were obtained from 2D, 3D, and 4D 1H-1H NOESY spectra with a 13C-, 15N-, or 13C/15N-filtered and/or edited scheme. NOE mixing times for the NOESY spectra were 100 or 150 ms. Dihedral angle restraints for the backbone u angles were obtained from 3JHNHa coupling constants measured using a 3D HNHA experiment.

Structure calculation

The DNA-binding/transactivation domain of PhoB, corresponding to residues 126≠229, was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described previously.20 To obtain a 13C/15N-labeled sample, the cells were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and 13C-glucose. NMR experiments for the isolated protein were carried out at 300 K, as described previously.20

Experimental distance restraints were derived from the cross-peak intensities in the NOESY spectra. Distance restraints were generally classified into four groups: strong ∞ ∞ ∞ (1.8≠3.0 A), medium (1.8≠4.0 A), weak (1.8≠5.0 A), and ∞ ) according to the peak intensity. For very weak (1.8≠6.0 A the intramolecular restraints of the DNA only, the follow∞ ing classification was used: strong (1.8≠2.5 A), medium ∞ ), medium (2.3≠4.0 A), weak (2.5≠5.0 A), ∞ ∞ strong (1.8≠4.0 A ∞ ). Pseudoatom corrections were and very weak (2.5≠5.5 A applied to the upper bounds of the restraints. Hydrogen bond restraints of the protein backbone were identified by slowly exchanging amide protons with supplementary consideration of NOE connectivity, and were characterized ∞ using two distance restraints: 1.5≠2.3 A between HN and ∞ between N and O. Hydrogen bond O and 2.5≠3.3 A restraints within DNA were used to maintain the base pairs. Torsion angle restraints were derived from the 3 JHNHa coupling constants as 2908< u < 2408 for 3 JHNHa < 5.0 Hz and 21608< u < 2808 for 3JHNHa > 8.0 Hz. Torsion angle restraints for the DNA backbone, covering both the A- and B-forms of DNA, were employed so that the right-handed phosphate backbone was maintained, avoiding a local mirror image conformation. The a, b, g, e, and f torsion angles were restrained to be 2658∆ 508, 1808∆ 508, 608∆ 358, 1808∆ 508, and 2858∆ 508, respectively. In addition, because the pattern of NOE signals was typical of B-form DNA, the d torsion angle was restrained to 1458∆ 308. Weak planarity restraints for base pairs were also employed.

The parenthesis is the scaling factor used in the refinement of the free-form. ∞ The force constants for dihedral angles and distance are kcal/(mol degree2) and kcal/(mol¡A2), respectively.

Using the CNS program24 with the restraints described earlier, the structures of the DNA-free and DNA-bound forms of the PhoB domain were calculated. For the free-form, a simulated annealing protocol starting from an extended structure was used. Ten final structures were selected from 100 structures thus calculated, based on the following criteria: no distance violation ∞ greater than 0.2 A, no torsion angle violations greater than 28, and a low target energy value. For the bound form, we used the following two-step process. First, the structure of the protein was calculated only using the intraprotein restraints. Ten structures out of 100 were selected using the same criteria as for the free-form. Second, the protein and an idealized B-form of the 16-mer duplex DNA were docked using a simulated annealing protocol, in which all the distance restraints were employed with 150 different initial structures, with each one of the 10 protein structures calculated earlier placed ∞ randomly at 15 different positions 50 A apart from the DNA. Then, the docked structures were further refined using another simulating annealing process. Finally, 10 structures were selected from the 150 structures according to the criteria listed earlier.
Structural refinement with explicit water

The structures were further refined using the MARBLE MD simulation program25 in an explicit water environment. The restraint functions adopted in this process were the same as those used in CNS (distance: soft-square-well function; dihedral angle: quadratic square-well function26; planarity of DNA base pairs: planarity restraint27) with the default values of CNS, unless otherwise mentioned. The force fields used here were CHARMM22/CMAP28 and CHARMM2729 for the protein and DNA, respec-

tively. Each structure obtained was placed in a periodic ∞ ∞ ∞ box with dimensions of about 75 A 3 75 A 3 75 A (for ∞ 3 64 A 3 64 A (the DNA-free ∞ ∞ the complex) and 64 A form) containing $12,000 and 8000 TIP3P water molecules,30 respectively. Counter ions were added to maintain the charge neutrality. The electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method31 without any cutoff operation. The symplectic integrator for a rigid body was used with a time step of 2 fs, in which water molecules and CHx , NHx (x 5 1, 2, 3), SH, and OH groups were treated as rigid bodies. The velocity scaling method was used to control the temperature. The protonation states of the His, Glu, and Asp residues were determined for the PhoB-DNA complex and DNAfree form as follows. For His, long-range 1H-15N HSQC measurements were carried out to obtain the 15Nd1 and 15 Nd2 chemical shifts according to the method of Ref. 32. Out of six His residues, the experimental data clearly permitted assignment of the protonation states of the following five residues: His144:HSP, His164:HSE, His169:HSP, His182:HSE, and His198:HSD in PhoB-free, and His144:HSP, His164:HSE, His169:HSP, His182:HSE, and His198:HSP in the PhoB-DNA complex. Here, HSD, HSE, and HSP are His residues in which the delta nitrogen, epsilon nitrogen, and both nitrogens are protonated, respectively. For His211, the HSQC signals did not permit unique assignment of the protonation state, but the pKa value calculated using MEAD33 allowed us to assign the protonation state as His211:HSP for both the DNA-free and the PhoB-DNA complex. For Glu and Asp residues, we used the pKa values of MEAD,33 as well as the number of hydrogen bonds involved in the carboxylic group. On the basis of the calculations, we assigned that all Glu and Asp residues were dissociated, except for Glu191 and Glu207 in the PhoB-DNA complex, which were protonated.

The simulated annealing protocol was summarized in Table I. First, the initial structure was subjected to energy minimization using the steepest decent method, followed by an equilibration step of MD simulation for 50 ps at 300 K with positional harmonic restraints. Then, after an equilibrium MD run for 50 ps at 300 K with the NMR restraints, the simulated annealing process started. During the heating process, all scaling factors of the NMR restraints were linearly reduced with increasing temperature from 300 to 800 K over 40 ps. A cooling process followed the heating process, in which temperature was reduced to 0 K. Finally, the structure was energy-minimized. The total simulation time for generating a structure was about 19 ns, taking about 57 h in a 128 CPU parallel computer. During the annealing process, we used the force constant for the base pair planarity weaker than the default value of CNS in order to make the DNA molecule sufficiently flexible.

for the PhoB DNA-binding/transactivation domain by using the refinement method with the explicit water environment, as well as 10 vacuum structures by using CNS software24 as a reference (see Methods for details). The refined structures in water are referred to as refW, and those in a vacuum as refV. None of the refW or refV ∞ structures had a distance violation over 0.2 A or a dihedral violation over 308. The DNA-free form of the PhoB domain was determined in the same way. Figure 1 shows (a) 10 superimposed refW structures of the DNA bound form of the PhoB DNA-binding domain and (b) a ribbon and stick model of the average structure. This structure comprises 104 residues from Met126 to Phe229, including the linker residues at the N-terminus. There are three a-helix bundles (a1≠a3) sandwiched by Nterminal and C-terminal antiparallel b-sheets formed by the strands b1≠b4 and b5≠b7, respectively. Helix a3 is the DNA recognition helix, and helices a2 and a3 and the a2≠ a3 loop form a helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. The a2≠a3 loop is called the transactivation loop, which reportedly interacts with the r70 subunit of RNA polymerase.21 The flexibility of this loop is argued to be a key feature in the transactivation activity (see later for discussion).17 The PhoB DNA-binding domain binds to the target DNA sequence in a tandem arrangement, in which two monomers of the PhoB domain bind head to tail to the two binding sites in the pho box.17 However, in the NMR experiment, in order to avoid overlaps in NOE peaks, we used a 16-bp DNA that has only a single binding site (50 -ACTGTCATAAATCTGT-30 ), and thus the system contains only a single PhoB domain bound to a single recognition sequence, as in the previous study.20 The influences of the tandem arrangement on the protein structure will be discussed later.

``Sequential'' indicates the restraint between the neighboring residues, or |i 2 j| 5 1 for two residues i and j. ``Medium-range'' and ``long-range'' are for 2 |i 2 j| 4 and |i 2 j| ! 5, respectively.

The quality of the refined refW structures was assessed by comparison with the refV structures. First, structural convergence was evaluated in terms of the root-meansquare deviation (RMSD) from the average coordinates, which are shown in the first part of Table III. The refW structures converge more than the refV structures, as shown by the smaller RMSD values of the refW structures. This means that the hydration effects and the electrostatic interactions in the refinement procedure appear to confine the structures to a narrower region. In other words, the information supplemented by the electrostatic and hydration interactions did not conflict with the information from the experimental NMR restraints, but rather helped to more precisely determine the structure. When the complex structures were superimposed using only the protein backbone, the RMSD values for DNA in the refW structures were found to decrease by as much ∞ as 1.8 A over the refV structures. The packing interactions between the protein and DNA were significantly

improved in the hydrated environment of the refW structures. The RMSD values from the average coordinates are plotted for each residue in Figure 2(a). The smaller RMSD values for the refW structures than for the refV structures confirm the better convergence shown in Table II. For comparison, the RMSD values from the average coordinates for four molecules (chains A, B, E, and F) existing in the asymmetric unit of the crystal (1GXP) are also shown in Figure 2(b). There is a good correspondence in the peak positions at the transactivation loop (the a2≠a3 loop) and the a3-310 loop between the crystal and refW structures, whereas the refV structures do not show clear peaks at those regions, but retain high

RMSD values, indicating that the inherent flexibility in PhoB is more properly represented in the hydrated environment of refW. The large RMSD values of the crystal structure at the transactivation loop suggest multiple conformations, which will be discussed in the next section. The structural quality was also assessed in terms of local backbone geometry according to the program PROCHECK34 (Table III). The proportion of residues residing in the most favored regions in the Ramachandran map was significantly increased in the refW structures relative to the refV for both the DNA-bound and DNAfree forms.

number of refined structures in previous studies.4≠9 In the present study, there is another source of improvement in local geometry, that is, the use of the CHARMM22/CMAP force field.28 Using this force field, the main-chain dihedral potential can be more accurately treated in torsion potential with the cross-term between the / and w angles.

Table III also summarizes the structural differences between the solution and crystal structures. The refW structures have smaller values of RMSD from the crystal structures compared with those of the refV structures. The decrease in the RMSD value is also seen in each element of the complex, PhoB and DNA, even in the freeform. Figure 2(c) shows the residue profiles for RMSD values from each chain of the crystal structures, which indicates multiple conformations at the transactivation (a2≠a3) loop. There are two types of crystal structures: the first comprises chains B and E, which resemble the solution structures, and the second comprises chains A and F, which have different loop structures. This difference can be confirmed by the numbers of violations of the distance restraints in the crystal structures [Fig. 2(c)]. In chains A and F, large violations were found at the transactivation loop, whereas chains B and E have no violation in the loop region. The peaks of the RMSD values at the a2≠a3 loop for B and E are thus due to poor convergence of the loop structure. This fact is reflected in the high correlation between the two profiles, shown by the convergence of the refW structures [Fig. 2(a)] and the RMSD values from the crystal structures [Fig. 2(c)], 0.90 for B and 0.84 for E (much larger than 0.71 for A and 0.69 for F), indicating that better convergence makes the structure closer to the crystal structure. Figure 3 shows the chain traces of the transactivation loop, clearly indicating two distinct conformations, one for chains A and F and the other for chains B and E. The refW structures belong to chains B and E group. The two groups are characterized by the direction of Asn187 and Val188 side-chains. In chains B and E, the side-chain of Asn187 points to the outside of the protein to form hydrogen bonds with the atom in neighboring cells (Asn187Od-Cyt8O4* and Asn187Nd-Cyt190 O2 in chain B, and Asn187Nd-Glu129Oe in chain E), whereas the side-chain of Val188 faces the inside of the protein. In chains A and F, the directions of the side-chains are reversed: the side-chain of Asn187 faces the inside of the protein to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds (Asn187Od-Asp192Od2 in chain A and Asn187NdGlu177Oe2 in chain F). This variety in conformations suggests that the flexible transactivation loop responds sensitively to subtle differences in the crystal environment, and adopts one of the two conformations accordingly. In solution, the loop adopts the conformation found in chains B and E, in which the polar side-chain of Asn187 is exposed to the solvent and the hydrophobic Val188 is buried inside. This flexibility of the transactivation loop is thought to be important for interactions with the r70 subunit of RNA polymerase.17 Another difference between the refW structures and the crystal structures is found at the tandem contact

between the C-terminal region, including b6 and b7 of the upstream protomer, and the N-terminal region around b2, b3, and b4 of the downstream protomer.17 The tandem contact causes a local structural change at the b2≠b3 loop of the second molecule (see Fig. 4), in which RMSD values from the refW structures are about ∞ 2.0 A, confirmed in some distance violations [Fig. 2(c)]. Since the b2≠b3 loop of the first molecule has a crystal contact with a neighboring protein, all chains show similar deviations from the refW structures, as shown in Figure 2(c). Chemical shift perturbation experiments performed in solution for the tandem contact also showed that local influences existed at the b2≠b3 loop (Nishimura, 2006, personal communication, Yokohama City University, Japan). Figure 4 compares the b2≠b3 loop of the refW structures and the crystal structures. The tandem contact appears to pull the b2≠b3 loop up slightly toward the first molecule. This is the only influence of the tandem contact found in the comparison between the crystal and solution structures. In addition, we will show later that the tandem contact has a negligible effect on the interactions between PhoB and DNA.
PhoB-DNA interface

hydrogen bonds formed between PhoB and DNA are given in Figure 5(a). The differences in the distances clearly indicate that the hydrogen bonds are formed more tightly in the refW than in the refV structures. Several atom pairs in refV should be regarded as not forming hydrogen bonds. For the side-chain atoms involved in hydrogen bonds, Figure 5(b) shows the RMSD values from the corresponding atoms in the crystal structure. Proper treatment of the interactions in refW appears to make the side-chain structure closer to that in the crystal structure, as in the overall structure shown earlier. A representative example of the side-chain structure at the interface is shown in Figure 5(c). In refV, the side-chain charges of Arg176 and Arg193 were set to zero, and thus, these residues did not make contact with the phosphate group of Thy80 , whose charge is also ignored. On the other hand, the corresponding residues in refW form hydrogen bonds with Thy80 as in the crystal structures.

the flexible side-chains exposed to the solvent, it is not easy to compare the hydration structures near the bulk solvent region on the basis of coordinates. Therefore, we used ``hydration site'' and ``hydration water'' indices. A hydration site is a donor or an acceptor group of a protein or DNA with a hydrogen bond with water. Hydrogen bonds were identified using the hydrogen bond calculation program, HBPLUS.35 A hydration water is one that forms a hydrogen bond with the hydration site. Table IV lists the average number of hydration sites and hydration waters in the 10 refW structures and in the four crystal structures. The hydration sites and hydration waters in the crystal structures are expected to be a subset of those of the refW structures, since mobile water molecules, such as those bound to a flexible side-chain, could be invisible in the crystal structure. Figure 6 shows the number of hydration waters shared by N structures out of the 10 refW structures (1 N 10) for the bound form (a) and for the free form (c). Figure 6(b,d) are subsets of (a) and (c), respectively, for corresponding observation for the crystal structures. Most hydration waters were shared by many refW structures, which implies that these hydration waters, as determined in the refinement process, are reliable as a hydration model. Figure 6 also plots the number of hydration

The numbers are the average values for the 10 refW structures or for the four structures in the crystal with the corresponding standard deviations. The numbers in the parentheses are for those observed in the specific binding site (TGTCA) in DNA. In the calculation, the equivalent hydration sites, Nh1 and Nh2 for argnine, Oe1 and Oe2 for glutamic acid, and Od1 and Od2 for aspartic acid were not distinguished. b Hydration sites and waters on the interface were found only in chain B of the crystal structure.

a. Ade90 has two water molecules bridging Asp196: one between Ade90 O2 and Asp196 O, and the other between Ade90 N7 and Asp196 Od. The former was also found in chain B of the crystal structure, but the latter was not. Chain B in the crystal has the structure most similar to the NMR structures [Fig. 2(c)]. These two water molecules are tightly bound, as evidenced by their very low RMSD values, 0.34 and 0.35, respectively. b. Thy80 is stabilized through the water-mediated interactions involving three residues, Arg176, Val218, and Gly222, in chain B of the crystal structure. The same hydrogen bonds were observed in four refW structures. c. A water molecule bridges Thy100 O2P and Arg203 Nh. Arg203 is highly conserved among the OmpR-PhoB family,17 and Nishimura et al. found that transcription activity was reduced by mutation of Arg203

waters surrounded by protein or DNA atoms, that is, buried water molecules with accessibility of the water's oxygen to other water molecules being less than 0.3. This histogram indicates that variation in the hydration structures between the crystal and refW structures mostly occurred in buried water molecules, particularly in those with small N values. In other words, the variation mainly originated from subtle differences in the shape of the water binding pocket, inside which water molecules are situated. Nevertheless, about 80% of buried water molecules in the crystal structures were shared by more than five refW structures, and thus it can be concluded that the hydration water molecules in the crystal structures were reliably reproduced as a subset of the hydration water molecules of the refW structures. In many DNA-binding proteins, water molecules mediating protein-DNA interactions play a crucial role in determining binding specificity and affinity.36 In the crystal structure, however, no such water-mediated hydrogen bonds were observed between PhoB and the pho box of DNA (Table IV).17 Instead, there are two bridging water molecules at the interface outside the pho box. On the other hand, in the refW structures, we identified 10 water-mediated protein-DNA interactions that are shared by more than four refW structures. Figure 7(a≠f) show representative water molecules in the refW and crystal structures mediating PhoB-DNA interactions. It is seen in these models that the sidechains of the protein and the base or phosphate groups of DNA are well converged to the one close to the crystal structures. This indicates that these refW models of the protein-DNA interactions are reliable. The stability of the mediating water molecules may be estimated from the

Overview of the interactions between PhoB and DNA. Contacts found in more than four refW structures and in all four crystal structures are given here. Solid and dotted lines indicate hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, respectively. Contacts found in both the crystal and refW structures are given in red, and those found only in refW are in blue. The protein residues are colored as follows: hydrophobic contacts (green), hydrogen bonds whose frequency of occurrence are 40≠80% in refW (light orange), hydrogen bonds whose frequency of occurrence are more than 80% in refW (orange). The specific binding site is colored pale red.

(Nishimura, 2006, personal communication). These facts suggest the importance of the bridging water. d. Cyt6 N4 in the pho box was recognized by a watermediated hydrogen bond with Arg193 O, which involves two different orientations of the water molecule. This is a hitherto unknown base recognition interaction. e. Both Thy100 and Gua110 are connected to Arg200 via two water molecules. f. Thy3 O2P forms two water-mediated hydrogen bonds to Glu159 Oe and Arg201 Nh. Glu159 is highly conserved in members of the OmpR-PhoB family.17 Mutation of Glu159 reduces transcription activity (Nishimura, 2006, personal communication) and a Arg201 mutant lost more than 50% of its DNA binding activity.21 These observations suggest that the water-mediated interactions described here may contribute significantly to the interaction between PhoB and DNA.

CONCLUSIONS The hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between PhoB and DNA are summarized in Figure 8. All of the interactions existing in the crystal structures were also observed in the refW structures. For example, the hydrophobic interaction in the C5M methyl group of Thy5, which is important in pho box recognition,17 was observed in both the crystal and refW structures. The similarity of the PhoB-DNA interactions in the crystal and refW structures indicates that the tandem arrangement of PhoB proteins has only a small influence on PhoB-DNA interactions. In addition, some interactions that were not found in the crystal structures were observed in the refW structures. In particular, more water-mediated interactions between PhoB and DNA were observed in refW. As seen in other DNA-binding proteins,10≠14 water molecules may play an important role in PhoB-DNA interactions.

In summary, we determined the solution structure of the PhoB DNA-binding/transactivation domain complexed with DNA by using an NMR refinement method with full electrostatic interactions and an explicit water environment. The refW structures were of much better quality than the structures refined in vacuum. This indicates the importance of the proper treatment of electrostatic interactions in protein-DNA interactions, in which the electrostatic interactions are dominant. Moreover, in the refined structures, we found many water-mediated interactions between the protein and DNA, which contribute to the DNA recognition of the PhoB DNA binding/transactivation domain.
