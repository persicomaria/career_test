Bean by the Viruses

Evidence that southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV) is capable of infecting uninjured cells of bean plants after being translocated in the xylem through scalded stems was reported by Schneider and Worley (11-14). Results of experiments reported herein show that SBMV is not unique in this respect but that tobacco necrosis virus (TNV) can also infect apparently nonwounded leaves of local-lesion hosts after transport in the xylem through scalded stems. Moreover, necrotic lesions developed in bean leaves when they were dipped into an aqueous suspension of TNV or SBMV or when they were sprayed with such a suspension. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), on the contrary, did not infect uninjured bean leaves in parallel tests. Results were obtained from 56 experiments conducted during 18 months. Plant viruses that are ordinarily translocated bidirectionally in the phloem can be transported upward in the xylem when injected directly into stems (6,14) or when they are introduced into the xylem through excised shoots (1) or by grafting (13). Until the present report, however, SBMV was the only virus known to infect apparently uninjured mesophyll cells by moving into them from the xylem (6, 11-14). Plants of bean (Phcsseolus vulgaris L. `Pinto' and `Kentucky Wonder Wax'), tobacco (iVicotiuna tabacum L. `Samsun NN'), and cowpea (Vigna sine&s (Torner) Savi `Ramshorn Wilt Resistant'), were grown singly in 4-inch pots in a greenhouse at 22-26°C. Each species or variety is a locallesion host of the viruses with which it was inoculated. In all experiments, plants were handled carefully to reduce the chances of

accidental wounding and were kept separate to prevent inoculation by contact. Test plants were fastened to stakes at the nodes below and above the region to be scalded. A l-cm band of absorbent cotton was wrapped around the secured stem. Approximately 1 ml of boiling water was then applied to the cotton with a lo-ml pipette. The cotton was removed when cool, and treated stems were allowed to dry before being inocuIated. These plants were inoculated by injection at a point an inch or two below the scalded portion of the stem; the nonscalded controls were injected at a similar point in the stem. When beans or cowpeas were the test plants, inocula were injected into the first or second internode above the unifoliate leaves. Tobacco plants were injected in the second or third internode above the soil line. Test plants were inoculated by puncturing their stems with a No. 22 or No. 27 hypodermic needle inserted through droplets of viral suspension (14), and an excessof inoculum was injected from a syringe into the punctured area of each stem. Bean plants were inoculated with SBMV, TNV, or TMV; tobacco and cowpea plants were inoculated with TNV or TMV. Preparations of virus purified by differential centrifugation were used in some experiments, but clarified juice from diseasedplants, either freshly prepared or frozen and thawed, was used as inoculum in most experiments. Similar results were obtained with both kinds of inocula. Necrotic lesions were seen in trifoliolate leaves of some bean plants 5-10 days after the stems had been inocuIated with SBMV or TNV; an average of five lesions developed in each infected leaflet. One to 17 lesions developed in most infected leaves, but 39 lesions formed in one leaf of the 218 bean plants inoculated with SBMV by injection. Symptoms occurred only in leaves that were expanding rapidly during the latent period of infection. For example, lesions were most

likely to form in the third trifoliolate leaf when plants were inoculated 3 weeks after the seed had been sown, and in the sixth or seventh leaf when inoculat,ions were made 7 weeks after seeding. Irrespective of the variety of bean, SBMV infected leaves in 42 % of the plants with scalded stems and in 60 % of the nonscalded controls (Table 1). TNV infected approximately 11% of the scalded plants and 18% of the nonscalded controls of the `Kentucky Wonder Wax' variety; it did not cause systemic necroses in 94 scalded plants of the `Pinto' variety, but did in approximatJely 6% of the nonscalded controls. Although TNV entered and infected nonwounded protoplasts of some bean leaves after transport in the xylem, this ability, unlike that of SBMV, was influenced by the species or variety of host plant, used in these experiments. SBMV and TNV were reisolated from single lesions by subinoculations t#o bean of the `Kentucky Wonder Wax' variety. Similar results were obtained in earlier experiments with SBMV in excised shoots of beans of the `Kentucky Wonder Wax' variety; lesions developed in uninjured leaves in 20 of 109 shoots whose cut ends had been submerged in suspensions of SBMV. When injected into stems, TMV did not cause systemic infections in uninjured leaves of 75 bean (Table I) or 24 tobacco plants, nor did TNV infect leaves of 80 cowpea or 64 tobacco plants. All test plants were observed daily for at least 3 weeks after inoculation. Infection of uninjured leaves of certain hosts by SBMV or TNV after transport in nonliving tracheary elements suggested to us that infection might also occur if uninjured leaves were submerged in viral suspensions, or sprayed with them. To test this possibility, inocula of SBMV, TNV, and TMV were prepared by making 10-l aqueous dilutions of clarified juice from diseased plants. Unexpanded trifoliolate bean leaves were submerged 5-10 seconds in each inoculum. In other experiments, inocula were applied in a fine mist with a chromatography sprayer to abaxial surfaces of unifoliate leaves. Tobacco leaves were sprayed in the same way with inoculum containing TNV or TMV. Necrot,ic lesions developed in 9 of the 52

bean leaves dipped into suspensions of SBMV and in 4 of the 30 leaves dipped into suspensions of TNV. Infections also occurred in 30 of 88 bean leaves sprayed with SBMV and in 32 of 96 bean leaves sprayed with TNV. Each diseased leaf had l-3 lesions. Results of these tests, unlike those of the injection experiments, were not influenced by the variety of bean used. There are at least 2 explanations for the observation that more infections by SBMV or TNV occurred in sprayed leaves than in dipped leaves. One is that accidental injuries were more numerous in sprayed leaves. An equally plausible explanation, however, is that unifoliate leaves, which were sprayed, are more susceptible to SBMV and TNV than are trifoliolate leaves, which were dipped into the inocula. TNV did not infect any of 72 tobacco leaves, and TMV did not infect any of the 102 `Pinto' bean leaves inoculated by dipping or spraying. One necrotic lesion formed, however, in each of two leaves of tobacco sprayed with TMV. These lesions probably developed at points of injury; each occurred near the base of the uppermost leaf that remained after the tops of the plants had been cut out with scissors. Presumably, the leaves were accidentally wounded when the tops were excised immediat'ely before inocu-

l&ion. No lesions developed in the 98 other leaves inoculated in this experiment. With the exception noted above, results of the experiments just described agree with those of tests in which stems of local-lesion hosts were inoculated by injection. SBMV and TNV infected bean leaves that had been dipped or sprayed; again, TMV did not infect bean and TNV did not infect tobacco. Our results do not provide an explanation for the inability of TNV to infect uninjured leaves of tobacco. Others have observed local lesions in leaves of cowpea (16) and Turkish tobacco (10) sprayed with TNV. Price (10) pointed out that the possibility of infection by contact was not eliminated in his experiments with tobacco; lesions developed only in leaves whose upper surfaces could have rubbed against the leaf above. Our results with tobacco also suggest that wounds are required for its infection with TNV, but the few lesions previously observed in TNVsprayed leaves of cowpea (16) could have resulted from infection of uninjured cells. Infections observed by Duggar and Johnson (5) in tobacco leaves sprayed with TMV probably began in damaged cells; we found that inoculum prepared by Duggar's method (4, 5) contained the abrasive, Celite, which could have wounded leaves of test plants at the time of spraying. In our experiments, infection of bean leaves by SBMV or TNV probably occurred in uninjured cells. Because all test plants were treated comparably, accidental injuries to protoplasts would have been as likely in plants inoculated with TMV as in those inoculated with SBMV or TNV. We believe that, had such injuries occurred, at least some of the 177 bean plants inoculated with TMV would have shown symptoms, despite the obviously inefficient methods of inoculation and the relatively high resistance of beans to TMV. We do not deny, however, that the leaves of test plants could have been imperceptibly wounded so as to damage protoplasmic membranes in the presence of virus. If such wounds occurred, it is conceivable that they would have permitted ingress by the relatively small, icosahedralshaped particles of SBMV or TNV but would not have allowed entry of the larger, rod-shaped particles of TMV.

It is not known how SBMV and TNV enter apparently undamaged protoplasts of some hosts so that infections result. TMV entered cultured protoplasts of tomato fruit by pinocytosis (S), but it is not known whether particles observed in pinocytic vacuoles or attached to pinocytic membranes were infective. TMV did not infect undamaged leaves of tomato after transport in the xylem (I), nor did it infect leaves and root hairs wetted with inoculum (2) or leaves after their vacuum infiltration with inoculum (2). Furthermore, TMV rarely infected highly susceptible varieties of tobacco sprayed with inoculum (7). It did not infect Nicotiana glulinosa L. sprayed with inoculum (8,15), even when leaves had been rubbed in the presence of an abrasive l-3 hours before inoculation (8). Moreover, Zech, cited by Mundry (9), found that TMV was incapable of infecting hair cells of tobacco after its injection into the spaces between cell walls and the withdrawn protoplasts of plasmolyzed cells. Thus, it is unlikely that TMV can cross intact plasma membranes and infect protoplasts, even though it can be taken into them by pinocytosis (8). SBMV and TNV, however, cause infections in bean leaves after entering apparently uninjured protoplasts. Entrance could occur by pinocytosis. The pinocytic membrane, unless somehow damaged, must be crossed, either by intact viral particles or by the infectious nucleic acid following deproteinization of virus in pinocytic vacuoles.

The Origin

of Bacteriophage

P221

Escherichia coli phage T2, having a stiff tail with a contractile sheath. Neither Fels I nor Fels 2 carry the c, g, or hP1 region of P22. Therefore, the following two possibilities for the origin of P221 were considered. P221 might be: (a) a recombinant between P22 and a prophage of St, or (b) a recombinant between P22 and a defective prophage of St. The phage P221 was found in P22 stocks grown on St or its mutants, but it was not found in P22 stocks grown on 23 other strains of Salmonella (2). Recently, P221 type phage was found in P22 stocks grown on Salmonella typhimurium strain MS8 and was found to form plaques on the P22-resistant mutant The frequency of this of M668, M68/22. new P221 type was about the same as that of P221 found in P22 stocks grown on St. Moreover, the new P221 type phage was antigenically indistinguishable from P221 and carried the c, g and h2l markers of P22 from which it arose. In addition, we found that both M668 and A1668/22 were lysogenic for a phage, designated ~$10, which is serologTABLE 1

The bacteriophage P221 was isolated from stocks of bacteriophage P22, grown on Salmonella typhimurium LT-2 (called St for short), at a frequency of about lo-lo (1). P221 forms plaques on St/22. Different strains of P22, containing the markers c +, cl, c2, or c3 and the color indicator markers g and h21, gives rise to P221 strains with corresponding markers, whereas the m3 marker of P22 never appears in P221 (2). However, these two phages are morphologically dist.inct: P22 has a short tail and a hexagonal base plate with six spikes, while P221 has a long, flexible tail with no base plate. Moreover, they are serologically unrelated: neither head nor tail antigens of P221 are related to those of P22 (1). Thus, P22 and P221 arepartiallyrelated genetically though all the protein subunits of phage particles are unrelated serologically (1). From the above information it seems likely that P221 is neither a mutant of P22 nor a prophage of St (2). Recently we found that both St and St/22 were lysogenic for two prophages, Fels 1 and Fels 2. The phage Fels 1 is serologically and morphologically indistinguishable from P221. Fels 2 is serologically related to neither P22 nor P221 and is morphologically similar to

This requires in the case of nitrogen mustard about 10 minutes' treatment with 0.25 mg/ml. The method for mixed infection was previously described (S). The multiplicity of infection was about 1.5 for each phage. In the case of inactivated phage, the original titer was used for the calculation of multiplicity. 6 The values were calculated against P22 progeny.
