The structure of agkistrodotoxin crystallized under basic Ê conditions has been determined at 2.8 A resolution by the molecular-replacement technique and re®ned to a crystallographic R factor of 0.194 and a free R factor of 0.260 with good stereochemistry. The molecular packing in the crystal differs from other PLA2s. The six molecules in the asymmetric unit form three dimers linked by Ca2+ ions in a near-perfect six-ligand octahedral coordinating system. Extensive intermolecular hydrophobic interactions occur at the interfacial recognition site of each neurotoxin molecule, which provides an insight into phospholipase A2±membrane interactions. This hydrophobic interaction-induced molecular association along the interfacial recognition site suggests a self-protection mechanism of agkistrodotoxin.

1. Introduction
Agkistrodotoxin (ATX) is a potent presynaptic neurotoxin puri®ed from the venom of Agkistrodon halys Pallas (A. blomhof®i Brevicaudus), a Chinese pit viper living in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces (Chen et al., 1981, 1987; Zhang et al., 1981). It functions at the presynaptic level by a typical triphasic modulation of neurotransmitter release, i.e. initial depression, subsequent facilitation and ®nal blockade of neurotransmission. The minimum lethal dose is 0.055 mg kgÀ1 in mice. ATX is also a group II secretory phospholipase A2 (PLA2) composed of 122 amino-acid residues cross-linked by seven disul®de bonds, with a molecular weight of 13 400 Da and an isoelectric point of 6.9 (Chen et al., 1981; Kondo et al., 1989). The PLA2 activity is essential for ATX to exert its neurotoxicity. A number of secretory PLA2 presynaptic neurotoxins have been isolated from snake venoms (for reviews, see Yang, 1994; Hawgood & Bon, 1991; Tzeng, 1993; for reviews on PLA2, see Arni & Ward, 1996; Mukherjee et al., 1994; Dennis, 1994). Some of them, e.g. crotoxin, -bungarotoxin and vipoxin, are functionally oligomeric proteins consisting of an indispensable PLA2 subunit and one or more inhibitory or chaperonic subunits, which target the neurotoxins towards the putative acceptors on the presynaptic membrane and/or protect them from non-speci®c binding. Crotoxin (Bon et al., 1979), a presynaptic neurotoxin from the venom of Crotalus durissus Terri®cus, is a heterodimer between a basic PLA2 subunit which is weakly toxic and a chaperonic acidic subunit with neither toxicity nor phospholipase activity. The basic subunit of crotoxin shows an $81% sequence identity with ATX, while the precursor of the acidic subunit is $66% identical to the acidic PLA2 from the same source as ATX. -Bungarotoxin is a disul®de-bond linked heterodimer composed of a PLA2 subunit and a Kunitz subunit, which targets the neuroActa Cryst.

toxin to the potassium channel (Kwong et al., 1995). However, ATX is a single-chain presynaptic neurotoxin with an unusual non-basic isoelectric point of 6.9, which distinguishes ATX from the other strongly basic PLA2 presynaptic neurotoxins. ATX has a strong tendency towards self-aggregation, especially at high concentrations, and the state of aggregation varies with the solvent components. Under crystallization conditions, ATX shows crystal-form polymorphism. It has so far been crystallized in at least six crystal forms (Li et al., 1995; Jin et al., 1990; L. Tang and Z.-J. Lin, unpublished results). However, all these crystal forms contain multiple molecules in the asymmetric unit, which causes dif®culties in structure determination by the molecular-replacement method (Rossmann & Blow, 1962). The structure of ATX crystallized at pH 4.5 in space group P21 with eight molecules in the asymmetric unit has been determined (PDB code 1a2a). The structure reveals a `dimer of dimers'-like molecular aggregation. The molecule contains a surface region with unique conformation and electrostatic characteristics which are remarkably different from those of non-neurotoxic snake-venom PLA2s. This region might be responsible for the recognition of agkistrodotoxin by the speci®c acceptor at the presynaptic membrane (Tang et al., 1997, 1998). Studies of the multiple crystal forms of agkistrodotoxin are useful in de®ning those structural features which might be in¯uenced by the crystal packing and in clarifying whether the aggregation state observed in the P21 crystal depends on the crystallization Ê conditions. Here, we report the 2.8 A resolution structure of ATX crystallized at pH 8.5 in space group P212121 with six molecules per asymmetric unit. The molecular packing shows distinct features. The implications for neurotoxic mechanism and PLA2±membrane interactions are discussed.

ATX was puri®ed from the venom of A. halys Pallas as previously described (Chen et al., 1981). Crystallization was performed by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method (Jin et al., 1990). The droplet was a mixture of 20 ml 10 mg mlÀ1 protein solution and 5 ml 0.6 M KCl in 0.1 M Tris±HCl buffer pH 8.5 and was equilibrated with 2.0 ml of reservoir solution consisting of 60% MPD (2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol) at 291 K. Crystals appeared within two weeks and belong to the space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 87.75, b = 105.80, Ê c = 110.03 A. There may be as many as six molecules in the asymmetric unit according to Matthews statistics (Matthews, Ê 1968); the corresponding Vm value is 3.18 A3 DaÀ1. Data were collected on a MAR imaging-plate detector mounted on a rotating-anode X-ray generator and were processed with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, in preparation; Table 1). Diffraction data revealed pseudo-Acentring symmetry at low resolution (Jin et al., 1990). A Ê Patterson map calculated at 20.0±5.0 A resolution showed a spreading non-origin peak near the centre of the crystallographic A face with a height of 24% of the origin peak (Fig. 1). The relative height of the non-origin peak to the origin peak was reduced signi®cantly when using higher Ê resolution for the calculation. In a 20.0±3.0 A Patterson map, the non-origin peak was located at (0, 0.524, 0.484) with a relative height of $9%. This indicates that the crystal has pseudo-A-centring symmetry and that the pseudo-symmetry breaks down at higher resolution.

2.2. Molecular replacement
Table 2

Molecular replacement was carried out with the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) from the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). One of the eight molecules (chain A) of the crystal structure of ATX at pH 4.5 (Tang et al., 1998; PDB entry code 1a2a) was selected as the Ê initial search model and all B factors were reset to 20 A2. A Ê resolucross-rotation function was calculated with 12±3.5 A Ê tion data and an integration radius of 20 A, which yielded the best results, i.e. the most accurate rotational parameters for the subsequent translation search (Table 2). The top 30 rotational peaks were used to calculate the translation function. The translation function seemed more susceptible to the data resolution cut-off than the rotation function. Distinguishable solutions were found in the translation function computed Ê with 12±3.5 A resolution data only for the cross-rotation peaks 1 and 4 (Table 2). The most prominent solution (peak 1) was ®xed in order to search for other solutions. Six promising translation solutions were picked out according to the R factor, correlation coef®cient and the value of the translation function compared with the noise. A round of rigid-body Ê ®tting using 12±3.0 A data resulted in an R factor of 0.393 and a correlation coef®cient of 0.644. The six molecules (named L1, L2, M1, M2, N1 and N2 in Table 2) in the unit cell were then checked and no severe overlap was observed. N1 and N2 are obviously A-centring symmetry-related solutions, and L1 and L2, M1 and M2 also reveal A-centring symmetry relationships after application of the proper crystallographic

² The cross-rotation peak 4 has two translation solutions, 4a and 4b, which are related by pseudo-A-centring symmetry and are referred to as monomers N1 and N2, respectively.

mations (see below). 10% of data in a number of randomly selected thin resolution spheres (DATAMAN program; Kleywegt & Jones, 1996) were excluded before any re®nement È for the calculation of the free R factor (Brunger, 1992b) in order to monitor the whole re®nement procedure. The six molecular-replacement solutions were ®rst subjected to a round of rigid-body re®nement de®ning each molecule as a group; R and Rfree were reduced to 0.422 and Ê Ê 0.430, respectively, at 3.0 A resolution. Data in the 8±2.8 A resolution range with F > 2' were then included. After cycles of re®nement and model building, the R factor dropped to 0.214 with an Rfree of 0.282. Signi®cant additional peaks were found in the electron-density maps and were assigned to Ca2+ ions. Bulk-solvent correction was then applied for all data Ê (30±2.8 A, F > 2'), which resulted in an R and Rfree of 0.221 Ê and 0.268, respectively. For data at 30±5.6 A resolution, R and Rfree dropped from 0.471 and 0.481 to 0.271 and 0.281, respectively. Water molecules were added based on the 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc electron-density maps and were checked for formation of hydrogen bonds. The current model contains 5826 non-H atoms, including three intermolecular Ca2+ ions, ®ve intramolecular Ca2+ ions and 17 water molecules (Table 1). Ê The crystallographic R factor is 0.194 (30±2.8 A, F > 2', 23582 re¯ections) and the Rfree value is 0.260. The overall real-space correlation coef®cient between the ®nal model and the 2Fo À Fc electron-density map is 0.87 (Fig. 2, calculated with the program O; Jones et al., 1991). R.m.s.d.s from ideal values Ê for bond lengths and bond angles are 0.007 A and 1.1 , respectively. The mean coordinate error of all atoms estimated Ê using Luzzati plots (Luzzati, 1952) is 0.30 A. The stereochemistry was checked using the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). The overall G factor is 0.22. All the non-glycine residues lie in the allowed regions and 88.5% of the residues are in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968; Fig. 3). The B-factor distributions for main-chain and side-chain atoms are shown in Fig. 4.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure

The structure of ATX crystallized at pH 8.5 has been Ê determined at 2.8 A resolution by the molecular-replacement method and re®ned to a crystallographic R factor of 0.194 with excellent stereochemistry. The ®nal 2Fo À Fc electron-density map shows good agreement with the atomic model. Crystal packing reveals obvious pseudo-A-centring symmetry (Fig. 5a). The asymmetric unit contains six molecules named L1, L2, M1, M2, N1 and N2 (Fig. 5b) as in the molecular replacement. The pseudo-A-centring symmetry in P212121 is equivalent to a non-crystallographic twofold axis which lies parallel to the crystallographic b or c axis. Thus, the six molecules can be divided into two groups related by the twofold NCS: N1, M2 and L1, and N2, M1 and L2. The relationship between the six molecules shows signi®cant deviations from exact A-centring symmetry, which could arise partially from non-speci®city of the hydrophobic intermolecular interactions (see x3.3). All the molecules lie in an orientation with the planes de®ned by two long helices (residues 39±55 and 89±110) approximately parallel to the bc plane of the unit cell. The molecular packing is completely different from that seen at pH 4.5 as a `dimer-of-dimers'-like structure

(Tang et al., 1998). In fact, the molecular arrangement in the pH 4.5 structure could not be maintained under basic condiÊ tions owing to the intradimeric close contacts of 2.45 A between the side-chain atoms Glu93 OE1 and Glu97 OE1, which could only be protonated at pH 4.5. Moreover, the molecular packing is also different from that of human nonpancreatic secreted PLA2 complexed with an analogue of a phospholipid, which also has six molecules per asymmetric unit (Oh, 1995). The details of molecular packing will be described and discussed below. The overall folding of ATX in the orthorhombic form is that of a typical group II secretory PLA2. The two long antiparallel -helices (residues 39±55 and 89±110) de®ne a platform on which the N-terminal helix (residues 1±15), the Ca2+-binding loop (residues 25±35), the so-called -wing (residues 74±85) and the C-terminal ridge cross-linked by seven disul®de bonds are situated. Pairwise C superposition between molecules N1, N2, M1, Ê L1 and L2 results in r.m.s.d.s of $0.20 A, while the r.m.s.d. between molecule M2 and the other ®ve molecules ranges Ê Ê from 0.31 A (molecules M2 and M1) to 0.38 A (molecules M2 and N2) owing to the distinct structure of the Ca2+-binding loop in molecule M2. Ca2+ ions were found in the Ca2+-binding loops of molecules N1, N2, M1, L1 and L2, and coordinated with the peptidyl O atoms of residues Tyr28, Gly30, Gly32 and the carboxylate O atoms of Asp49, with the exception of molecule N1, which contains the two coordinating water molecules usually found in high-resolution PLA2 structures. However, the position corresponding to the Ca2+ in molecule M2 is not occupied by a Ca2+, but by the N$ atom of residue Lys86 of molecule L1, which forms a salt bridge with the Ê carboxylate group of Asp49 with a distance of 2.72 A (Fig. 6). The monomeric structure of ATX at pH 8.5 reported here is virtually superposable with that in the P21 space group crystallized at pH 4.5 (PDB entry code: 1a2a); the resultant r.m.s.d. Ê is 0.70 A for all C atoms of molecule A in the P21 structure and molecule N2 in the present structure. The structure of the catalytic network consisting of His48, Asp99, Tyr52 and Tyr73 is highly conserved and is not affected by the variation in the pH of the crystallization conditions. These data indicate less ¯exibility in the remainder of ATX structure. The only signi®cant difference occurs at the tip of the -wings (Fig. 7). Residues 78±81 twist away from the molecular core and the maximum deviation between equivalent C atoms of these residues is Ê 3.41 A (for residue 79). The rotomer conformation of the aromatic ring of residue Tyr81 changes by about 120 around the CÐC bond. These differences may be a consequence of the different environments of these residues. For example, the $amino group of Lys78 in molecule N2 forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate group of Asp111 from molecule M2. The phenyl plane of Tyr81 from molecule N2 is nearly parallel to the guanidine plane of Arg108 from molecule M2, with a centroid Ê distance of $3.7 A. In the pH 4.5 structure, the -wing tips participate in the intradimeric interactions (hydrogen bonds involving residues 77, 78, 80, 81, 82 and aromatic±aromatic interactions between side chains of residues Tyr81) and interdimeric interactions (hydrogen bonds between peptidyl N and O atoms of residues Ile77). The local conformation of the proposed neurotoxic site (Tang et al., 1998), i.e. turn 55±61 and stretch 85±91, is virtually the same as that of the P21 structure Ê Ê (r.m.s.d. is 0.35 A for C and 0.63 A for all atoms excluding the surface side-chain atoms of residues Asn59 and Lys86). The conformational stability of the neurotoxic site might be advantageous for ATX to readily ®t the speci®c acceptor on the presynaptic membrane. The sequence of ATX used for crystallization was not determined. Residue 31 in the crystal structure of ATX at pH 4.5 was assigned as a Gly according to the sequence reported previously Figure 5 (Kondo et al., 1989) and the region of residues (a) Crystal packing showing the pseudo-A-centring symmetry.

density map (Tang et al., 1998). However, in the present electron-density map, residue 31 is clearly a Trp, even though the starting model taken from the structure of ATX at pH 4.5 has a Gly at position 31. During re®nement, signi®cant peaks above the 2' level appeared near the C atoms of residues 31 in the 2Fo À Fc electron-density map and could be properly allocated to Trp side chains (Fig. 6). For this reason, Trps were assigned to position 31 of all six molecules of this ATX isoform. The side chain of Trp31 from molecule M2 has the Ê best de®ned electron density, with a mean B value of 19.1 A2, while the corresponding electron density in molecule L2 is the weakest of all the molecules. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that there may be Trp in ATX (Zheng et al., 1993). It is also possible that ATX may exist as isoforms which contain Trp or Gly at position 31. The presence of isoforms is frequently observed for PLA2 presynaptic neurotoxins, e.g. crotoxin (Faure & Bon, 1989) and ammodytoxin (Ritonja & Gubensek, 1985).

Besides the ordinary intramolecular Ca2+ ions in the Ca2+binding loops, three intermolecular Ca2+ ions have been found between molecules N2 and L2, M2 and M1, and L1 and N1. Thus, the six molecules in the asymmetric unit can be divided into three similar Ca2+-linked dimers, N2±L2, M2±M1 and L1±N1 (Fig. 8a). The non-crystallographic symmetry operations mapping N2±L2 to M2±M1 and M2±M1 to L1±N1 are a Ê rotation of 120.1 plus a translation of 16.2 A and a rotation Ê of 113.9 plus a translation of 16.7 A, respectively. No non-crystallographic threefold screw axis exists because the positions of these rotation axes differ remarkably, although their directions deviate by no more than 3 . Each intermolecular Ca2+ ion is located on the local twofold axis within the dimer and is well coordinated by six O atoms: Asp71 OD1, Glu92 OE2 and Ile72 O from both monomers (Fig. 8b). These ligands form a near-perfect octahedron and Ê the average distance from Ca2+ (2.46 A) is close to that

Ê revealed in high-resolution crystal structures (2.4 A; Table 3). This six-ligand octahedral coordinating system is distinct from the usual helix±loop±helix or EF-hand motif of Ca2+-binding proteins, in which the Ca2+ ion is located in a pentagonal bipyramid formed by seven chelators (Strynadka & James, 1989). The structure of porcine pancreatic PLA2 (Thunnissen et al., 1990; PDB entry code 2phi) revealed a Ca2+-linked dimer; the Ca2+ also lies in the centre of an octahedron formed by O-atom ligands from corresponding residues. However, the arrangement of the six coordinating atoms differs interestingly from our structure (Fig. 8c). When three coordinating atoms from one monomer (e.g. N2 of ATX) are properly superposed onto the corresponding atoms from one monomer of 2phi, the other three coordinating atoms from residues 71, 72 and 92 of monomer L2 take the positions of 72, 92 and 71 from monomer B of 2phi, respectively. Although the Ca2+ ion is the sole connection between two monomers in both cases, the Ca2+linked dimer of 2phi cannot be arranged as it is in ATX. One reason is the difference in the side-chain length of residue 71, which provides a pair of ligands for Ca2+. Residue 71 of ATX is Asp, while in 2phi it is Glu. This one bond-length difference will cause an extreme deviation of the dimeric arrangement because it occurs near the local twofold axis between monomers. Another reason, which might be more important, lies in the `pancreatic loop' (residues 62±66 in 2phi; Arni & Ward, Figure 6 1996), which does not exist in ATX and is The salt bridge (dashed line) between the $-amino group of Lys86 from molecule L1 (bold line) one of the criteria for differentiation of and the carboxylate group of Asp49 from molecule M2 (solid line). Also shown is the 2Fo À Fc group II PLA2s from group I (Heinrikson, electron-density map contoured at 1.3' calculated during the re®nement before the side chain 1991).

assumed to be arranged in the same manner as ATX, their `pancreatic loops' would overlap severely (Fig. 8b). The three intermolecular Ca2+ ions have a mean B value of Ê 16.1 A2 in the ®nal model and their electron densities in the 2Fo À Fc map are above the 6' level, while the mean B value Ê of the intramolecular Ca2+ ions is 41.8 A2. Since both types of 2+ Ca binding occur under the same crystallization conditions, it seems that Ca2+ binding is preferential for the intermolecular sites compared with the intramolecular sites, i.e. the intermolecular sites might have a higher association constant for Ca2+ binding. This may be because of the extensive electrostatic interactions between Ca2+ ions and the four carboxylate ligands, the basic pH and the proper stereochemistry of the involved ligands. Notably, the carboxylate ligands Glu92 and Asp71 lie within or near the putative neurotoxic site, i.e. two adjacent regions around turn 55±61 and stretch 85±91, and the negative charge of Glu92 is unique for presynaptically neurotoxic PLA2s (Tang et al., 1998). Presumably, the strong tendency of these acidic residues to bind positively charged ions might be signi®cant for ATX± acceptor recognition. Similar intermolecular Ca2+ ions play an important role in the assembly and disassembly of many viruses (Durham, 1978; Ilag et al., 1994). Such Ca2+-binding sites can be incorporated into the target protein in order to provide strong directional interactions for protein±protein association and protein stabilization, which may be useful in protein engineering and design.

position and orientation within each molecular pair are to some extent variable owing to the non-speci®c nature of the hydrophobic interactions therein.

Intermolecular hydrophobic interactions Ê sponding parameters for N1 and M2 are 178.0 and 8.66 A, Extensive intermolecular hydrophobic interactions occur at respectively. The relative orientation of two molecules within three hydrophobic molecular interfaces between molecules molecular pairs N2±M1 and N1±M2 deviates by 9.4 , while the relative position along the local twofold axis within pair N2 and M1, molecules N1 and M2, and molecules L2 and L1 Ê N1±M2 is 3.95 A larger than pair N2±M1.

The losses which the catalytically active residue His48 is accessible to of solvent-accessible surface area caused by the hydrophobic substrates, are shielded in the interior interface. The details of contacts for dimers N2±M1, N1±M2 and L2±L1 are 433.5, the three interfaces are quite different. The relative molecular Ê 539.4 and 769.5 A2, respectively (the solventaccessible surface area of one molecule is Ê $5700 A2). Among the three pairs, N2±M1 and N1±M2 are generally similar to each other, as they are related by the twofold NCS. The hydrophobic residues participating in the interfacial interactions, including Leu2, Leu3, Ala18, Ile19, Pro20, Phe24, Trp31, Met118 and Phe119 (Table 4), lie at the socalled interfacial recognition site and form a relatively ¯at extended hydrophobic area (Dijkstra et al., 1981; Heinrikson & Kezdy, 1990; Biltonen et al., 1990).

M2, respectively, while those of molecules M2, M1, L2 and L1 are only partially covered. In particular, the side chain of Trp31 from molecule L2 ®ts well into a small surface depression of molecule L1 surrounded by residues 24±31 and 119± 122, and the indole ring is nearly parallel with the phenyl rings of Phe24 and Phe119 from molecule L1 (Fig. 9d). Similarly, the side chain of Trp31 from molecule L1 also inserts into the corresponding region of molecule L2. These hydrophobic interactions might mimic those occurring at the PLA2±membrane interface. Each member of the molecular pair serves as the phospholipid bilayer surface for its partner. The protein molecule contacts the membrane via its ¯at interfacial recognition site and, meanwhile, the indole ring of Trp31 may insert into the phospholipid region as a membrane anchor to stabilize the PLA2± membrane complex, which may contribute to the interfacial activation of PLA2 on the membrane. In the structure of ATX crystallized at pH4.5, two sets of residues Ile19, Pro20, Ala23, Phe24, Met118 and Phe119 from a pair of adjacent molecules form a hydrophobic interface and their interactions play a central role in the crystal packing (Tang et al., 1998). This implies that the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions along the interfacial recognition site are strong, although non-speci®c, and seem independent of solvent conditions. It is possible that, driven by hydrophobic effects, the molecular pairs in the present structure could also form in solution, which might explain the tendency of ATX towards aggregation. This hydrophobic interactioninduced molecular association suggests a self-protection mechanism for ATX. In solution, ATX molecules could be associated into hydrophobic interaction-

related molecular pairs. Hence, the interfacial recognition sites and the entrances to the hydrophobic channel of both ATX molecules are masked from the solvent by its partner, which prevents the neurotoxin from promiscuously binding to non-targeting membrane and avoids exhaustion of neurotoxin molecules en route to the presynaptic membrane. Structural analysis showed that the entrance to the hydrophobic channel of the PLA2 subunit of vipoxin, a heterodimeric presynaptic neurotoxin, is masked by its inhibitory subunit (Perbandt et al., 1997). Thus, the self-protection mechanism proposed here is to some extent similar to that of vipoxin. In other words, ATX might act as a homodimeric neurotoxin. It is widely accepted that PLA2 presynaptic neurotoxins might interact with speci®c acceptors on the presynaptic membranes via the neurotoxic sites at the molecular surface (Tzeng, 1993; Kwong et al., 1995) and several groups have reported the puri®cation and characterization of membrane proteins which might serve as the acceptors for presynaptic neurotoxins (Hseu et al., 1990; Yen & Tzeng, 1991). It has been proposed that the regions around turn 55±61 and stretch 85±91, which show unique local conformation and electrostatic characteristics, might be the neurotoxic site of ATX, i.e. the site responsible for neurotoxin±acceptor recognition (Tang et al., 1998). PLA2 activity is essential for ATX to exert presynaptic neurotoxicity. Covalent modi®cation of the catalytically active residue His48 of ATX by p-bromophenacyl bromide results in simultaneous loss of PLA2 and neurotoxic activities (Kondo et al., 1989), as reported for other presynaptic neurotoxins (Yang, 1994; Hawgood & Bon, 1991). Considering these data, a neurotoxic mechanism for ATX emerges as the following: (i) the neurotoxin molecules diffuse towards the presynaptic membrane as molecular pairs held together by hydrophobic interactions between the interfacial recognition sites and (ii) upon reaching the presynaptic membrane, the neurotoxin
