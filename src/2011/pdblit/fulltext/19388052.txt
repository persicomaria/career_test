Abstract: The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is well recognized as one of the essential cellular components of the DNA replication machinery in all eukaryotic organisms. Despite their prominent importance, very little biochemical and structural information about plant PCNAs is available, in comparison with that obtained from other eukaryotic organisms. We have determined the atomic resolution crystal structures of the two distinct Arabidopsis thaliana PCNAs (AtPCNA), both complexed with the C-terminal segment of human p21. Both AtPCNAs form homotrimeric ring structures, which are essentially identical to each other, including the major contacts with the p21 peptide. The structure of the amino-terminal half of the p21 peptide, containing the typical PIP box sequence, is remarkably similar to those observed in the previously reported crystal structures of the human and archaeal PCNA-PIP box complexes. Meanwhile, the carboxy-terminal halves of the p21 peptide in the plant PCNA complexes are bound to the protein in a unique manner, most probably because of crystal packing effects. A surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed high affinity between each AtPCNA and the C-terminal fragment of human p21. This result strongly suggests that the interaction is functionally significant, although no plant homologs of p21 have been identified yet. We also discovered that AtPCNA1 and AtPCNA2 form heterotrimers, implying that hetero-PCNA rings may play critical roles in cellular signal transduction, particularly in DNA repair.

archaeal PCNAs, as well as the RB69 bacteriophage gp43 protein, in common form homotrimeric ringshaped architectures accommodating a DNA duplex, similar to the E. coli DNA polymerase III b subunit (b-clamp), where only two subunits encircle the DNA as a homodimer. It is generally considered that PCNA, with the pseudo-sixfold symmetry, can slide along double-stranded DNA.5­9 Thus, PCNA is generally called the sliding clamp, which can serve as a docking platform for many proteins involved in DNA metabolism. Further studies on PCNA demonstrated that it plays a crucial role not only in DNA replication but also in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis.10 Detailed analyses of the yeast and animal PCNAs led to the identification and characterization of more than 50 PCNA-interacting proteins.11 Although the living organisms in the animal, plant, fungal, and archaeal kingdoms evolved from each other in ancient times, the most basic mechanism responsible for DNA replication seems to be highly conserved among them. The best example supporting this notion was the identification of PCNA genes in different species, such as yeast: budding yeast12 and fission yeast13; animals: human,14 rat,15 mouse,16 and Drosophila17; plants: carrot,18 maize,19,20 rice,21 and common bean22; as well as archaeon: Pyrococcus furiosus.23 Furthermore, experimental results obtained using the yeast and Drosophila PCNAs revealed that these two molecules can functionally substitute for mammalian PCNA in DNA replication assays.24,25 It was also demonstrated that recombinant rice PCNA stimulates the enzymatic activity of DNA polymerase d from human cells.26 Other studies on mammalian PCNAs showed that they stimulate the activity and processivity of two wheat d-like polymerases.27 Another important result, highlighting the highly conserved function of PCNA, described the stable complex formation between purified pea PCNA and human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21/WAF1.28 This suggests that the p21 protein, induced by the DNA damage-induced cell-cycle growth arrest, targets at least two proteins, the G1-cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and PCNA. It was also shown that the p21 protein contacts the plant PCNA via its C-terminal segment. Thus, the atomic structure of the plant PCNA in complex with human p21 could provide useful insights into putative conservation of p21 homologs in plants. In this study, we successfully purified and crystallized the recombinant AtPCNA1 and 2 proteins, both complexed with the C-terminal fragment of human p21, and solved the three-dimensional (3D) structures of both complexes. These structures demonstrated that AtPCNA1 and 2 indeed adopt identical architectures, which are typical of the sliding clamp with the pseudosixfold symmetry. These structures also provided important insights into the possible presence of a potential p21 homolog in plant cells.

Results and Discussion General architectures of AtPCNA1 and 2
The plant AtPCNA1 and AtPCNA2 molecules, both complexed with the p21 peptide, were crystallized under similar crystallization conditions. We obtained two crystal forms (form 1 and form 2), with different space groups and unit cell constants (Supporting Information Table I and Fig. 1), although the molecular arrangements within the crystal lattice were similar to each other. We determined the AtPCNA1-p21 complex ° structure in form 1 at 2.0 A resolution and the ° AtPCNA2 complex structure in form 2 at 2.5 A resolution. The PCNAs form homotrimeric ring structures in both crystal forms [Fig. 1(A)], and the overall structures of AtPCNA1 and AtPCNA2 are almost the same, including the major contacts with the p21 peptide. AtPCNA1 and AtPCNA2 share 96% amino acid identity in their sequences [Fig. 1(B)], with only eight different amino acid residues. These different amino acids are not involved in either the p21 peptide interaction or the subunit interfaces [Fig. 1(C)]. Indeed, the two PCNAs are well superimposed on each other, with an RMSD of ° 0.4 A. Therefore, our description of the overall structure and the detailed views of the interactions with the bound peptide will primarily be based on the higher resolution structure of the AtPCNA1-p21 complex. The plant PCNA forms the homotrimeric architecture, which exhibits the domain configuration with a pseudo-sixfold symmetry. The single subunit is composed of two structural domains, each containing a long, interdomain connecting loop (ID-loop, Fig. 1). Overall, the plant PCNA structure is similar to those of the previously reported PCNAs from human, yeast, archaea, and bacteriophage, highlighting the remarkable structural conservation across the domains of life [Fig. 1(B)].5­7,9

Interactions of the p21 peptide with AtPCNA1 and 2
Figure 2(A,B) shows a structural view of the interactions between the plant AtPCNA1 and the p21 peptide. The amino-terminal half of the p21 peptide, containing the typical PIP box sequence,29 is bound to the PIP box binding pocket of AtPCNA1. The protein­peptide interaction is mainly hydrophobic, and this part of the p21 peptide forms a one-turn helix, with Met147, a key residue of PIP, located at the bottom of the binding pocket [Fig. 2(B)]. This interaction mode is strikingly similar to those observed in the previously reported crystal structures, including the human and archaeal PCNA-PIP box complexes.6,30 On the other hand, the carboxy-terminal half of the p21 peptide is bound to the plant PCNA in a unique and unexpected manner. In the human PCNAp21 peptide complex,6 the carboxy-terminal half of the peptide interacts with the ID-loop to form an antiparallel b structure. In contrast, in the plant AtPCNA1-

p21 peptide complex crystal structure, the same part of the peptide does not contact the ID-loop. Instead, it protrudes out of the molecule and interacts with another p21 peptide bound to the neighboring PCNA subunit [Fig. 2(C) and Supporting Information Fig. 2]. These distinct binding modes between the human and plant proteins are probably derived from crystal packing effects. In fact, in the crystal lattice, the IDloop of the plant PCNA extensively contacts the same segment in the adjacent subunit (Supporting Information Fig. 2). This contact mode, which was not observed in the human structure, appears to block the

normal interaction between the carboxy-terminal part of p21 and the plant PCNA. On the other hand, a conservation map, generated using the program ConSurf,31 indicated that the p21 peptide binding surface comprises highly conserved amino acid residues [Fig. 2(D)]. Therefore, a similar binding mode to that in the human complex structure would exist in solution. In fact, our SPR analysis strongly supported this interpretation, as described in the following section. Furthermore, a minor difference was discovered when the plant and human PCNA structures were compared. In the human structure, Ile158 of p21

side chains in the plant PCNA (Supporting Information Fig. 2). These substitutions may be another factor underlying the distinct binding mode.

Binding of the p21 peptide to AtPCNAs
To analyze the strength of the interactions between the short fragment of the p21 peptide, used for the crystallographic analyses, and the Arabidopsis PCNA1 and PCNA2 proteins in solution, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. In fact, such an interaction between a plant PCNA and a short fragment of human p21 was previously reported.28 Because of the low isoelectric point of AtPCNAs, we were not able to immobilize the PCNA protein on the chip. Thus, we immobilized the same p21 peptide as that used for the crystallographic analysis, and then various concentrations of PCNA proteins were passed over the chip (see Fig. 3). The KD values for the AtPCNA1 and AtPCNA2 interactions with p21 were calculated by the use of the BIAevaluation software, based on the same simple binding model (A þ B ¼ AB) as previously used for the evaluation of the interaction between human PCNA and p21.32 The obtained KD values (AtPCNA1 KD ¼ 5.8 Â 10À7M, AtPCNA2 KD ¼ 5.9 Â 10À7M) were comparable to each other, suggesting no difference in affinity to the tested p21 fragment. Our data also suggested that the binding between the plant PCNA and the p21 fragment might be functionally significant, although the strength of the affinity is about 10 times lower than that between the human PCNA and the p21 fragment (KD 5.8 Â 10À8M). This different affinity is not surprising, considering the fact that the human p21 protein is not an actual homolog of the natural plant PCNA-interacting protein. The strong interaction observed between p21 and AtPCNAs highlights the biological significance and the possible presence of a functional plant p21 homolog, which has not been reported yet. It should also be considered that the peptide used in our studies was only 22 amino acids (140Gly-Ser160) long, and thus is much shorter than the 39 amino acid peptide (126GlnPro164) fused to GST, which was used previously.32

Figure 3. Analyses of interactions between AtPCNA and the C-terminal fragment of human p21. Aliquots (70 lL) of purified AtPCNA proteins at various concentrations (500­ 2000 nM) were injected at a flow rate of 20 lL/min at 25 C onto chips with the immobilized p21 fragment. The injection was started at time 0 and finished at time 120 s. Sensorgrams for AtPCNA1 and AtPCNA2 are shown on panels A and B, respectively. The sensorgrams did not show significant differences in binding between the p21 peptide and AtPCNA1 or AtPCNA2.

Analysis of heterotrimerization
The presence of two PCNA genes in A. thaliana raises an intriguing question about the functional roles of the proteins encoded by these genes. Our two AtPCNA crystal structures did not display obvious differences that could be directly connected with distinct functions. However, a recent report suggested various functions for AtPCNA proteins related to DNA repair.33 For instance, it was shown that only AtPCNA2 could functionally interact with Arabidopsis DNA polymerase g. In fact, the coexpression of DNA polymerase g and AtPCNA2, but not AtPCNA1, restored normal UV resistance in a yeast RAD30 mutant. Thus, we tested the possibility of whether AtPCNA1 and AtPCNA2 could adopt heterotrimeric ring structures, which might also have different biological functions in vivo. The conserved subunit interface

between the two AtPCNAs [Fig. 1(C)] suggests that these PCNAs may form the heterotrimer in cells. The AtPCNA1 and AtPCNA2 proteins were coexpressed in E. coli and were purified (Materials and Methods, Supporting Information Fig. 3). Gel filtration profiles showed the single peak, which corresponds to the trimer, indicating that coexpressed AtPCNA proteins also form the trimeric ring in solution (data not shown). An analysis of the different migrations of the His-PCNA/PCNA proteins by native gel electrophoresis revealed that the AtPCNA1/2 proteins can form various heterotrimers (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 8). Indeed, PCNA formed four different PCNA rings (composed of 1/1/1, 1/1/2, 1/2/2, and 2/2/2 monomers) in E. coli cells, implying that various heterotrimers with different biological functions could also be expressed in plant cells.

In contrast to other results that suggested the ring­ring interaction in mammalian cells,34 we did not observe such an interaction (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 7). Together with previously published results,33 our findings suggest that the difference between the AtPCNA proteins may play important roles in signal transduction pathways. Although the knowledge about plant PCNAs is still limited, we can envisage that different ring compositions might lead to various types of signal transduction in response to specific stimuli. Collectively, these data shed new light on biochemical properties of PCNA in plant cells. In particular, we wonder whether plant PCNA molecules undergo posttranslational modification during DNA damage. In fact, such phenomena are well known in yeast and mammals, in which PCNA is frequently ubiquitinated upon DNA damage.35

The PCR reactions were done in a 50 lL volume, containing 1Â PCR buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM MgSO4, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% TritonV X-100 (v/v), BSA 0.1 mg/mL, pH 8.8), 0.2 mM dNTPs, 2.5 U of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 2 mM of each primer, and 1 ng of template plasmid. The preliminary denaturation was performed at 94 C for 5 min, and 30 cycles of amplification sequentially followed at 94 C for 30 s, 50 C for 30 s, and 72 C for 2 min, and then an incubation at 72 C for 7 min was performed on a thermocycler (Takara). The resulting products were purified, digested with BamHI and NdeI (Takara) restriction enzymes, cloned into the pET15b expression vector using a Ligation High kit (Toyobo), and sequenced. E. coli Rosetta cells (Novagen) were transformed using these constructs and grown at 37 C in 2 L LB medium containing ampicillin (100 lg/mL) and chloramphenicol (30 lg/ mL). Isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 1 mM) was then added when the culture reached an OD595 of 0.6, and the AtPCNA proteins were induced at 37 C. After 4 h of induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000g for 15 min at 4 C), resuspended in 50 mL of buffer A (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) containing EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and sonicated (10 min, 5 s pulses, 10 s break). All of the following procedures were performed at 4 C. The cells were centrifuged at 35,000g for 30 min, and the cell lysate was loaded onto a 3-mL Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A. The unbound proteins were removed by a wash with 10 volumes of buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole. The bound proteins were eluted with 10 mL of buffer A containing 250 mM imidazole. Next, using an Amicon 5K filter (Millipore), the proteins were exchanged into buffer B (50 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol (v/v), pH 8.0), concentrated to 20 mg/mL, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at À80 C until use.

All of the following procedures were performed at 4 C. The cells were centrifuged at 35,000g for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 40% saturation. The suspension was stirred for 20 min and centrifuged at 35,000g for 30 min. The pellet was discarded, and then ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant again to 60% saturation. This suspension was stirred for 20 min and centrifuged at 35,000g for 30 min. The precipitate was dissolved in 50 mL of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, containing 1M ammonium sulfate, and was applied to a 5-mL HiTrap Phenyl FF column (Pharmacia). The unbound proteins were removed by a wash with 10 volumes of the same buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 25 mL of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, dialyzed against 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, and applied to a 5-mL HiTrap Q HP column (Pharmacia). The unbound proteins were removed by a wash with 10 volumes of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, and the proteins were eluted with a 200 mL linear gradient from 0.2 to 0.5M NaCl in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6. Fractions containing highly pure AtPCNA were pooled, exchanged into buffer B with an Amicon 5K filter (Millipore), concentrated to 20 mg/mL, and then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at À80 C until use.

0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, immunodetection was performed using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham, Pharmacia) at room temperature.

Crystallization and X-ray analysis
Each peptide complex of A. thaliana His-PCNA1 and His-PCNA2 was obtained by mixing a 1.5 molar excess of the synthetic p21 peptide (139GRKRRQTSMT DFYHSKRRLIFS160) with His-AtPCNA (20 mg/mL). Moreover, in the case of the His-AtPCNA1-p21 complex, 0.5 mM DNA duplex (10/14) was added, as described previously,37 although it was later found that the crystal contained no DNA. These complexes were crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 293 K. In both cases, diffraction quality crystals were obtained using a reservoir containing 100 mM citric acid (pH 4.5) and 1.8M ammonium sulfate. The complexes were crystallized in two crystal forms. The form 1 crystals belonged to the space group ° R32, with unit cell constants: a ¼ b ¼ 110.10 A, c ¼ ° , and contained two PCNA­peptide com403.93 A plexes per asymmetric unit. The form 2 crystals, belonging to the space group R3, with unit cell con° ° stants a ¼ b ¼ 223.70 A, and c ¼ 200.88 A, contained eight complex molecules per asymmetric unit. X-ray diffraction data of the crystals were collected on BL38B1 at SPring-8 (Harima, Japan). The wavelength was ° set to 1.0000 A, and a Jupiter-210 CCD detector (Rigaku/MSC Corporation) was used to record the diffractions images. Data sets were processed by the HKL2000 package.38 The crystals were soaked in reservoir solution supplemented with 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol before flash cooling. The crystals were kept in a 100 K dry-N2 stream (Rigaku) during data collection. The data collection statistics are summarized in Supporting Information Table I. The A. thaliana PCNA1-p21 peptide complex structure was determined by molecular replacement, using the program CNS and the human PCNA-p21 peptide complex as a probe. Only the PCNA subunit was used for the structure determination. The two subunits at the correct positions were refined using the programs CNS39 and O.40 After the initial crystallographic refinement cycles, the bound p21 peptides were clearly visible in the electron density maps, and atomic models for the peptides were built. The protein­peptide complex structure was further refined to convergence. The structure of the AtPCNA2­peptide complex was determined by molecular replacement, using the program CNS and the AtPCNA1 structure as a probe. Crystallographic refinements were reiterated to obtain satisfactory convergence. The crystallographic statistics are summarized in Supporting Information Table I. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, under the accession codes 2ZVV and 2ZVW, for the AtPCNA1 and AtPCNA2 complexes, respectively.

Analysis of heterotrimerization
The sets of constructs, pET15bAtPCNA1 and pET29a AtPCNA2, and pET15bAtPCNA2 and pET29aAtPCNA1, were introduced into E. coli Rosetta cells (Novagen). The strains were grown at 37 C in 2 L LB medium containing ampicillin (100 lg/mL), kanamycin (100 lg/mL), and chloramphenicol (30 lg/mL). When the OD595 of the culture reached 0.6, the temperature was lowered to 20 C, and then the production of the AtPCNA proteins was induced with 1 mM IPTG overnight. The expressed proteins were purified for HisAtPCNA1 and His-AtPCNA2 as described earlier, and thus AtPCNAs trimeric rings without any His-tags were removed in the step using Ni-NTA agarose column. They were then fractionated by 4% native PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting or Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining.

Western blotting
HisAtPCNA1, AtPCNA1, HisAtPCNA2, AtPCNA2, and the heterotrimer were separated by 4% native PAGE in 1Â TBE buffer and electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane (0.2 lm) (Millipore), as described previously.36 After the transfer, the membrane was blocked with PBS containing 10% (w/v) fat-free milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h. The membrane was incubated with a tetra-His horseradish peroxidase antibody conjugate for 1 h at room temperature (Qiagen, dilution 1:1000). After three washes in PBS supplemented with

The experiments were performed using a BIACORE 2000 (Biacore AB, Sweden) in running buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant (v/v), pH 7.4). The human p21 fragment (2.5 lg in 50 lL) was injected over the sensor chip (Sensor Chip CM5, Biacore AB, Sweden) and linked by carbodiimide-coupling, following the manufacturer's protocol. The purified AtPCNA protein solutions (70 lL) at various concentrations were injected at a flow rate of 20 lL/min at 25 C. The association and dissociation of AtPCNAs and the p21 fragment were indicated as shifts in resonance units during the injection and after the exchange to running buffer. Dissociation and association rate constants (Kdiss and Kass) were obtained with a simple binding model of A þ B ¼ AB, using the BIAevaluation 2.1 software (Biacore AB, Sweden), and KD values were calculated as the ratios of these values.
