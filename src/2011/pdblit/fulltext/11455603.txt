ABSTRACT The enzyme chorismate lyase (CL) catalyzes the removal of pyruvate from chorismate to produce 4-hydroxy benzoate (4HB) for the ubiquinone pathway. In Escherichia coli, CL is monomeric, with 164 residues. We have determined the structure of the CL product complex by crystallographic heavy-atom methods and report the structure at 1.4-Å resolution for a fully active double Cys-to-Ser mutant and at 2.0-Å resolution for the wild-type. The fold involves a 6-stranded antiparallel -sheet with no spanning helices and novel connectivity. The product is bound internally, adjacent to the sheet, with its polar groups coordinated by two main-chain amides and by the buried sidechains of Arg 76 and Glu 155. The 4HB is completely sequestered from solvent in a largely hydrophobic environment behind two helix­turn­ helix loops. The extensive product binding that is observed is consistent with biochemical measurements of slow product release and 10-fold stronger binding of product than substrate. Substrate binding and kinetically rate-limiting product release apparently require the rearrangement of these active-site-covering loops. Implications for the biological function of the high product binding are considered in light of the unique cellular role of 4HB, which is produced by cytoplasmic CL but is used by the membrane-bound enzyme 4HB octaprenyltransferase.

In bacteria the first step from chorismate to ubiquinone is the removal of the pyruvyl moiety by the enzyme chorismate lyase (CL), also called chorismate pyruvate lyase, encoded by the ubiC gene (Fig. 1). The enzyme from Escherichia coli is monomeric with 164 amino acid residues and Mr 19 kDa.1,2 The N-terminal methionine is apparently removed posttranslationally to produce the functional enzyme.1 Chorismate lyase functions by cleaving a carbon­ oxygen bond to release pyru©

vate from chorismate with concomitant aromatization of the ring, producing 4-hydroxybenzoate (4HB), also called p-hydroxybenzoate (PHB). Thermodynamic and quantum chemical studies of the CL reaction have shown that it occurs nonenzymatically in solution at a significant rate and is essentially irreversible.3,4 Biochemical studies have shown that the enzyme is inhibited strongly by product and have measured the kinetic parameters for catalysis and inhibition.2 The enzyme binds its product with an affinity more than 10-fold greater than it binds substrate (Km 29 M, Kp 2.1 M).1,5 These unusual kinetic properties and the intrinsic biological importance of the pathway have motivated the structural investigation of chorismate lyase. Although the product 4HB is soluble by virtue of its carboxylate and hydroxyl functional groups, its fate in E. coli is to be conjugated with octaprenyl pyrophosphate by the membrane bound enzyme 4HB octaprenyl transferase, encoded by the ubiA gene.1 Products of the remaining synthetic steps to ubiquinone retain the octaprenyl moiety and presumably are membrane bound, as is ubiquinone itself. Thus, 4HB is an interface metabolite in that it is produced by a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme but is used by a membrane-bound enzyme. The CL sequence is homologous to translated genomic sequences (presumably encoding CL enzymes of similar structure) in several bacteria (Fig. 2), but there appears to be no significant homology to any sequence of known

Fig. 1. Chorismate lyase (CL) reaction and its relation to the ubiquinone pathway and to other chorismate pathways. All steps to ubiquinone after CL occur in the cell membrane. The CL reaction removes the pyruvate group from chorismate. The chorismate mutase (CM) reaction cleaves the same bond, but reattaches the pyruvate group at a different position (Claisen rearrangement) to form prephenate. A bicyclic transition state analogue of the CM reaction,7 in which the pyruvyl group is bound to the benzoate ring at both positions, is used in this study to model the CL­ chorismate complex (see Figure 5).

structure. The structures of two other chorismate processing enzymes are known: anthranilate synthase (AS)6 and chorismate mutase (CM).7,8 Although these are not homologous to CL, they catalyze partly similar rearrangements to the same substrate and thus would be expected to possess similar features in the electronic structure of the active site. The CM structures 1ecm (from E. coli) and 2cht (from Bacillus subtilis) include a bicyclic transition state analogue in the active site, providing two distinct examples of binding modes for a close structural analogue of the dianionic substrate chorismate. The crystal structure of the pyridoxal phosphate enzyme aminodeoxychorismate lyase,9 1eto, is known, which also performs a reaction similar to CL, upon a slightly different substrate, and requiring its cofactor. Previously we reported that mutation of one or both of the two cysteines of CL (to serine) gave fully active enzyme with improved solution and crystallization behavior. Distinct crystal polymorphs of wild-type, C14S, and the double mutant C14S, C81S, with widely varying properties, were reported.10 In the present work, the structure is determined by heavy atom methods using the single mutant in its orthorhombic crystal form, and subsequently solved by molecular replacement in both the wild-type and double-mutant forms. All three structures are of the enzyme­product complex. Because the three structures are similar except at the mutation sites and crystal contacts, we focus our description on the highest resolution structure, the double mutant refined at 1.4-Å resolution.

The novel folding topology and structural basis of high product binding are described and mechanistic implications considered. MATERIALS AND METHODS Structure Determination The enzyme was prepared essentially as described,4 except that 4HB was added at 5 mM during the purification to reduce aggregation. The product binds with micromolar affinity1 and was retained by the enzyme throughout the structure determination. Crystal growth at pH 7.0 and high-resolution (double mutant) data collection were as described.10 The structure was determined by the SIRAS method (Single Isomorphous Replacement with Anomalous Scattering) using the C14S mutant crystallized in the orthorhombic form (Table I). Soaking of crystals in 1 mM mercuric acetate overnight resulted in mercury binding to Cys 81. Room temperature diffraction data collection using a rotating Cu anode and a Siemens Hi-star multiwire detector yielded native and derivative data sets that were sufficiently isomorphous to give a clear Patterson map (peak at 7 level using 10 ­ 4-Å resolution data shell), defining the location of the mercury site. In order to optimize the anomalous signal contribution to phasing, a flash-frozen derivatized crystal diffracted at beamline 17-ID of the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron (using 20% PEG 400 as cryoprotectant), and anomalous scattering data were collected at wavelength 1.0051 Å using an Area Detector Systems charge-coupled-device

of the protein molecule. Improvements to the map were made by solvent flattening and real-space averaging of several SIRAS maps calculated from different native data sets, even though the individual figures of merit for these maps ranged as low as 0.63. The location of the phasing site near one corner of the sheet helped constrain potential assignments of sequence to structure. Partial model building and phase combination strategies enabled gradual interpretation of map regions away from the central sheet. When the orthorhombic structure was 90% complete, the molecular replacement program AmoRe14 was used to solve the cysteine-free triclinic structure in which the native diffraction data are superior (triclinic data collection was as described10). The triclinic structure was then completed and refined at 1.4-Å resolution, using the program CNS,15 to R 0.16 and Rfree 0.18. Refinement and structure statistics for all three forms are given in Table I. The refined structure of the triclinic double mutant includes all 1315 nonhydrogen protein atoms, the product 4HB, and 238 water molecules that were added to the structure where difference electron density maxima exceeded 2.8 times the level and hydrogen bonding geometry was reasonable. Ramachandran analysis using the program PROCHECK16 finds that all residues are within either the most favored or the additional allowed regions of conformation space. The structure and diffraction measurements have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession codes 1g1b (wild-type), 1g81 (C14S mutant), and 1fw9 (C14S, C81S double mutant).

The locations of the six -strands of chorismate lyase (CL) are indicated above the alignment.

Structure Analysis Secondary structure was determined by the routine DSSP.17 Multiple sequence alignments (Fig. 2) used the program CLUSTALW (www2.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw).18 Surface hydrophobicity fractions were determined by CNS by summing the surface area contributions (probe radius 1.4 Å) of the side-chains of Met, Phe, Leu, Ile, and Val residues and dividing by the total surface area. Structural comparisons with known folds used the programs DALI,19 VAST20 and CE.21 The four independent CL structures (three crystal forms, in which one form has two molecules per asymmetric unit) have C root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) from each other that are all 0.75 Å, and they are qualitatively similar at the level of detail described in the following discussion. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Fold and Overall Structure The crystal structure of the CL product complex shows that the core of the CL fold is a 6-stranded antiparallel -sheet with strand order 123654 (Figs. 3, 4). Each of the edge strands contains a bulge22 (bulge residues 50 ­51 and 127­128). Surrounding the sheet are several short helices and irregular segments formed by the N-terminal 43 residues and the loop regions 56 ­72 and 97­122. There are no segments (helical or otherwise) spanning the sheet and there is no helix longer than 12 residues. The secondary structure content is 27% , 40% . Most of the connections (3 out of 5) between -strands are tight turns,

detector. All diffraction data were reduced using X-GEN.11 Table I includes diffraction statistics. SIRAS phasing normally requires two crystals (native and derivative) because the derivative supplies both SIR and AS information, but in the present case two distinct derivative crystals were required. As a result of freezing nonisomorphism, the SIR information was obtained at room temperature. Because of the need for a specific x-ray wavelength in order to maximize anomalous scattering, the AS information was obtained at a mutliwavelength synchrotron beamline, whose intense beam necessitates freezing the crystal. Thus, the SIRAS calculations combined information from frozen and unfrozen crystals, as well as combining different wavelengths and using different detector systems. Phase and map calculations were with the PHASES programs.12 The resolution of the SIRAS phases was limited to 2.8 Å by the diffraction of the room temperature derivative crystal. The average figureof-merit for the phase set was 0.71. Map Interpretation and Refinement Electron-density map fitting used the graphics program TURBO.13 The SIRAS map clearly showed the core -sheet

and the 3 nonglycine residues that have L conformation (Asp 83, Ala 135, and Ser 147) are in these turns, in each case followed by a glycine. Loop segments 21­ 40 and 101­119 form two helix­turn­ helix flaps that overlie the product binding site. In a previous article, we reported a weak sequence similarity between CL and the B. subtilis CM (e.g., 2cht. pdb), based on what appeared to be a set of conserved active-site arginines.10 It now appears, in light of the CL structure, that this apparent homology was a misleading consequence of the arginine-rich CM active site and the unusually high Arg level in CL (see below). The CM and CL folds are topologically dissimilar (the 5-stranded CM sheet is mixed parallel/antiparallel, with strand order 32415 and two spanning helices). The active site similarities between CL and CM are discussed below. The CL structure displays approximate twofold symmetry (Figs. 3, 4), with the dyad passing perpendicularly through the center of the sheet and through the product binding site. The symmetry includes the entire sheet and could be considered to include the flaps as well. Breaking the symmetry are the N-terminal 20 residues and the loop between strands 1 and 2 (residues 56 ­72). The two 33residue half-sheets superimpose with C RMSD of 2.45 Å. This level of structural similarity, together with weak sequence similarity (7 identities in the 33-residue intrasheet alignment), suggests that the domain may have

arisen from genetic duplication of a half-sheet substructure. The situation is reminiscent of the aspartyl protease family, where the active site is on a dyad and is covered by two flaps. The bulges in the edge strands (which do not adhere to the peudodyad) accentuate the twist of the sheet, bringing the N-terminal residues of the edge strands closer together and thus making the active site more enclosed. The new CL structure was tested for similarity with previously determined structures. The various folding topologies that have been observed in proteins are taxonomically organized in the SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) database23 (http://scop.berkeley.edu). Before CL, SCOP contained no isolated sheets of 6 antiparallel strands with topology 123654. To identify the nearest structural neighbors of CL, we used three automated alignment programs accessible by internet: DALI (http:// www2.ebi.ac.uk/dali), VAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ Structure/VAST/vast.shtml), and CE (http://cl.sdsc.edu/ ce.html). These programs compare a query structure with a subset of the PDB that represents the set of unique folds. The programs allow for insertions, and calculate the RMSD between the part of the query structure and the part of a database neighbor structure that match the best. CL was submitted as a query structure to each of these programs, and each produced a ranked list of structural neighbors. In two of the three searches, the nearest neighbor is a yeast RNA polymerase subunit (1A1D,

cate that CL is the only known case of a folding unit comprising a 6-stranded antiparallel sheet with topology 123654. Furthermore, based on the reactions catalyzed and the locations of active sites, none of the nearest structure neighbors identified by DALI, VAST, and CE appears to have a close functional relationship with CL. There is apparently no homologous structure in the PDB. However, genes homologous to CL have been sequenced in several other bacteria; the alignment in Figure 2 shows that in general these sequences conserve the residues that are involved in 4HB binding in the present structure (see next section). These homologous proteins likely are chorismate lyase enzymes of similar structure. In general they appear to maintain the complete 6-stranded sheet, with the exception of the Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence that clearly deviates after the first three strands. The two cysteines in CL (residues 14 and 81), which are not required for activity,5 are not near the active site (distances of 21 Å and 11 Å respectively) and not conserved. Active Site Structure The enzymatic product 4HB is bound internally, near the geometric center of the enzyme, behind the tips of the two flaps, adjacent to Gly 90 of the sheet (Figs. 3­ 6). The 4HB carboxylate is H-bonded in a bidentate manner to the side-chain of Arg 76 (H-bond lengths 2.7 Å and 2.8 Å) and also to the peptide amide nitrogen of Leu 114 (2.8 Å). The 4HB hydroxyl oxygen is H-bonded to the side-chain of Glu 155 (2.6 Å) and also to the amide of Met 34 (3.0 Å). The arrangement of polar ligands to the 4HB is similar to that seen in the substrate complex of the enzyme 4HB hydroxylase (1doc), except in that enzyme a tyrosine hydroxyl and a main-chain carbonyl are used to bind the 4HB hydroxyl group.24 In CL, each of the two main-chain-to-4HB Hbonds involves one of the active site flaps. Three hydrogen bonds connect the flaps together (lengths 2.7 Å, 2.8 Å, and

Secondary structure as determined by DSSP.17 The diagram shows the general organization of the protein, including its approximate twofold symmetry, the central location of the 4HB binding site, and the locations of several residues involved in binding 4HB.

1EN0:H). This neighbor was listed second, after -galactosidase (1bgl:A), by DALI. The RNA polymerase neighbor has a 6-stranded sheet with the same connectivity as CL, but the domain also includes a second (4-stranded) sheet. Two strands of this second sheet occur as an insertion between the two halves of the 6-stranded sheet. These differences and other differences in the loops and the overall geometry result in the following statistics for the 3 alignments to this neighbor protein: DALI, 86 residues, RMSD 3.6 Å; VAST, 62 residues, RMSD 2.6 Å; CE, 84 residues, RMSD 3.3 Å. The other matches to CL involve smaller regions. In many of these, including the match with -galactosidase, the aligned region includes a series of ribbons that resembles a subsheet of the CL sheet. Diaminopimelate epimerase (1bwz) has 16 strands and 4 helices, out of which a noncontiguous substructure of six strands can be identified that has the CL topology. None of the neighbors has a simple 6-stranded sheet as CL does. These findings indi-

The view direction is similar to that in Fig. 4, with the sheet forming the back wall of the active site. The active site flaps in the foreground are brown and purple, except for the 4HB-contacting side-chains Ser 33 and Leu 114. The eight side-chains that contact (within 3.6 Å) the 4HB are colored green. The 5 hydrogen bonds to the 4HB are indicated by fine dotted lines. The 3 hydrogen bonds that connect the flaps are drawn as bold dotted lines. Several flap side-chains, including Lys 36 and Tyr 117, have been omitted for clarity. The chemical structure of the CM transition state analogue (pink) is identical to that of substrate chorismate, except that the bond labeled X is absent in chorismate. This gives the chorismate molecule freedom of rotation around bond R. In both the CL and CM reactions, bond R is broken. Free rotation around bond R would probably give the CL-bound chorismate a conformation different from that pictured here, especially in view of the steric overlap between the pyruvyl group (upper part of pink structure) and the flaps. This figure is intended to show the 4HB binding environment and the two potential locations on the 4HB where the pyruvyl leaving group could have been attached before catalysis: the two meta positions labeled M1 and M2. The pictured superposition places the scissile R bond upward from the M1 position, rather than downward from the M2 position. Because the 4HB is symmetric, in principle either is possible; the M2 site appears less likely due to steric overlap with the sheet. The superposition as depicted produces steric overlap only with the flaps, regardless of the rotation of bond R. Figure made using MOLSCRIPT.25

This unusual arrangement results in a chain of alternating electrical charges through the core of the enzyme (Fig. 4).

buried ionic chain pictured in Figure 4, are well conserved among the homologous sequences in Figure 2. Composition and Surface Hydropathy CL has an unusually high arginine content (14 out of 164, or 8.5%, compared with the average of about 2.5%). Two arginines are involved directly or indirectly in 4HB coordination (Fig. 4), and each of the active site flaps contains an arginine (Arg 37 and Arg 116). Although the enzyme has low electric charge at neutral pH (20 Asp Glu; 21 Arg Lys; 1 His) the arginines give regions of the surface a combination of hydrophobic character and positive charge. The enzyme also has an unusually high leucine content (32 out of 164, or 19.5%, compared with the average of about 7%) and an unusually high fraction of solvent-exposed hydrophobes, including Leu 25, Leu 29, Leu 30, and Leu 118 that belong to the active site flaps. The surface fraction contributed by Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, and Val side-chains was quantitated using CNS,15 for CL and for a random sample of ten other monomeric proteins. For CL the fraction is 11%; the other proteins had a range of 5--13% and a mean of 8%. The relatively hydrophobic surface probably contributed to solubility/aggregation problems with the protein,5,10 and may be important in some aspect of biological mechanism (see final section). Mechanistic Implications Chorismate is a major metabolic branchpoint that supplies five distinct biosynthetic pathways. The structures of two other chorismate processing enzymes are known: anthranilate synthase6 and chorismate mutase.7,8 The AS structure 1qdl, from Sulfolobus sulfataricus, contains no active site ligand and is not considered further in this study. Three distinct structures (from three organisms) of chorismate mutase (CM) are known. This enzyme cleaves the same bond in chorismate as CL but then recombines the two parts to produce prephenate. Two of these CM structures (1ecm and 2cht) contain a bound transition state analogue, facilitating detailed modeling of chorismate binding and giving substantial mechanistic insight into the mutase reaction. Interestingly, the two globally dissimilar CM complexes display many common active site features. They use arginines in similar arrangements to bind substrate carboxylates. In CL, Arg 76 appears to serve in such a role (Figs. 4, 5) but, because the pyruvyl moiety is absent from the 4HB product, it is unknown how the pyruvyl group of the substrate is bound by CL. Is there a positively charged CL moiety (probably an arginine) that binds the carboxylate of the leaving group? There are several arginines nearby but none of them is close enough to serve this function without significant side-chain and main-chain rearrangement. The crystal structure and kinetic measurements show that the CL product is tenaciously retained.1,5 The intimacy of the enzyme­product complex makes the enzyme look as much like a 4HB binding protein as like a catalyst. Product release must involve extensive rearrangements, including motions of both active site flaps and the breaking of several hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5). CL appears to be one

enzyme with two distinct jobs. The catalytic reaction may be the easier job, as it is known to occur spontaneously at a significant rate.3 The second job, product retention/ release, appears involved and product release appears energetically unfavorable. We now consider the mechanisms of the two CL functions, catalysis and product release. Previous biochemical studies found that a lysine mutation at position 155 was responsible for the ubiC-deficient phenotype of E. coli strain AN244.2 This is consistent with present findings, since the charge reversal of a Glu-to-Lys mutation would disrupt the charge balance in the enzyme core. Moreover, the Glu 155 side-chain is the bestpositioned candidate to serve as the base that removes the hydrogen from the 4 position of the substrate's cyclodiene ring, which, by analogy to CM, is probably an early step in the catalytic reaction. We have attempted to model the CL substrate complex based on the observed product complex. Figure 5 shows a hypothetical model of a substrate analogue docked into the crystallographic CL active site. This endo-oxabicyclic compound is used because it resembles chorismate closely (it has the same atoms, but one additional bond; see Fig. 1) and has been crystallized in the CM active site.7 For the present docking, we assumed that the substrate binds in a manner similar to that observed for the product; to form the substrate analogue, the pyruvate leaving group was added back onto one of the two meta carbons of the benzoate ring. Because the 4HB is completely surrounded by enzyme groups in the crystal structure, neither of the two possible meta sites can accommodate the leaving group without significant steric overlap with protein atoms in the observed structure. However, one site places the pyruvyl moiety on the more exposed side of the ring and appears more likely than the other (Fig. 5). This more likely site sterically overlaps the pyruvyl group slightly with both the flaps, whereas the other meta site involves overlaps with main-chain atoms of the central sheet. Clearly the flaps must move if chorismate binding resembles 4HB binding. Because a substrate complex cannot be modeled by simple embellishment of the crystallographic product complex, there are no solid conclusions at present about substrate binding and catalysis. To probe the mechanism of product release, we have modeled the opening of the flaps by successive small rotations of Ramachandran angles and other local adjustments, interspersed with global least-squares energy minimization (Fig. 6). Opening the flaps appears to provide the most parsimonious route for product release, because the shortest path from 4HB to bulk solvent is between the flaps (along the line of sight in Figs. 4, 5). Such a release mechanism must involve the opening of the flaps at least enough to break the three hydrogen bonds that connect them (Fig. 5), and also the breaking of the five H-bonds to the product itself. Although crystallographically ordered, the flaps have temperature factors consistent with relatively high mobility (1.5­2 times the mean values for the protein), especially flap 2, which also contains two conserved glycines, Gly 110 and Gly 115 (Figs. 2, 3). The

conformational flexibility of these glycines could facilitate the opening of flap 2. Opening of either flap exposes hydrophobic side-chains buried behind it. Such rearrangements are energetically unfavorable but appear necessary for product release. The biological rationale for the elaborate retention and release of 4HB by CL is an unresolved question. The cellular requirement for 4HB is low (compared with other chorismate products such as those feeding amino acid biosynthetic pathways); therefore CL may be acutely product inhibited as a simple means of restricting metabolic flow into this branch of the pathway. This explanation is economical but rigid. Alternatively, the retention and release machinery of CL may have evolved as part of a mechanism for delivering 4HB to its destination, the integral membrane enzyme 4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase.1 Experiments designed to test these mechanistic hypotheses by examining the effects of product analogues, membrane components, and mutations are planned.
