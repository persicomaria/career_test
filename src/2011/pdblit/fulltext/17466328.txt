The structure of proteins that are difficult to crystallize can often be solved by forming a noncovalent complex with a helper protein--a crystallization ``chaperone.'' Although several such applications have been described to date, their handling usually is still very laborious. A valuable addition to the present repertoire of binding proteins is the recently developed designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) technology. DARPins are built based on the natural ankyrin repeat protein fold with randomized surface residue positions allowing specific binding to virtually any target protein. The broad potential of these binding proteins for X-ray crystallography is illustrated by five cocrystal structures that have been determined recently comprising target proteins from distinct families, namely a sugar binding protein, two kinases, a caspase, and a membrane protein. This article reviews the opportunities of this technology for structural biology and the structural aspects of the DARPin-protein complexes.
Despite the continuous technical advances in protein crystallography due to the worldwide effort in structural genomics programs that promote the application of automated procedures in cloning, expression, purification, crystallization, data collection using synchrotron radiation, and computational crystallography, the determination of some protein structures remains a difficult task. Today, the main limitation is the growth of welldiffracting crystals--a pure trial-and-error process--because the formation of protein crystals depends on several unpredictable variables. In particular, advances in microscaling methodology involving pipetting robots and automated imaging of individual experiments have allowed high throughput approaches boosting the field. However, even with these advances, many proteins resist forming suitable crystals on their own because of inherent structural flexibility and instability. Consequently, conformation stabilizing methods that help to crystallize proteins seem attractive. Approaches in this direction are removal or mutation of surface residues known to be flexible (Lawson et al., 1991), the trimming of the protein's often flexible N- and C-terminal ends, or the analysis of stable domains of larger multidomain proteins (Derewenda, 2004). Another successful approach to promote the crystallization of a particular protein has been the addition of a conformation-stabilizing ligand. Current crystallization tools include the building of complexes with diverse known natural or synthetic ligands, such as substrates, inhibitors, nucleic acid, cofactors, or protein ligands. The benefits of such noncovalent complexes can be manifold. A specific conformation of the target protein may be stabilized in such a complex. This increases the chances to obtain crystals of proteins that otherwise adopt several conformations and therefore resist forming crystals. In addition, novel surfaces can potentially provide better crystal contacts. Especially for membrane proteins, protein ligands also increase the hydrophilic surface area of an otherwise small non-transmembrane region. This strategy for the crystallization of membrane proteins has repeatedly led to successful structure determinations, as seen for many antibody fragment-membrane protein complexes (Dutzler et al., 2003; Hunte et al., 2000; Iwata et al., 1995; Zhou et al., 2001). Cocrystallization of a target protein in complex with a proteinaceous ligand of known structure potentially provides another advantage, namely the structure solution by molecular replacement allowing to avoid the often time-consuming determination of phases via heavy atoms as in single/multiple anomalous dispersion or multiple isomorphous replacement techniques. DNA and RNA binding proteins are often cocrystallized with their natural binding partner, fragments of DNA or RNA stabilizing the conformation of the protein (Anderson et al., 1984). In many cases, however, the protein of interest lacks a natural binding partner, the natural binding partner might not be known, or it might not be available for other reasons. Therefore, proteinaceous ligands, either natural or synthetic, have received a great deal of attention in the field of structural biology. Antibody and fragments thereof are the most successful molecules to be used as high-affinity and specific binding proteins in biomedical research and have not only been used as a binding protein but also assist in crystallization (Amit et al., 1986). In 1995, Ostermeier et al. selected monoclonal antibodies for the first time against a membrane protein, namely cytochrome c oxidase of Paracoccus denitrificans, finally allowing the successful structure determination of the oxidase in complex with a FV fragment (Iwata et al., 1995; Ostermeier et al., 1995). In addition to the wellknown Fab and Fv fragments, single-chain antibody domains such as camelid VHH fragments or scFvs led to successful structure determinations (Desmyter et al., 1996; Kortt et al., 1994). Recently, several studies using nonantibody scaffolds such as affibodies (Hogbom et al., 2003; Wahlberg et al., 2003), monobodies (Koide et al., 2007), and repeat proteins (Binz et al., 2004) have shown that these molecules are potential alternatives to antibody fragments in structural biology. These binding molecules were developed as tools for basic research, but their potential use in commercial applications (as specific reagents in biomedical research and as potential therapeutic molecules) was immediately apparent and quickly recognized (Gill and Damle, 2006). Many novel binding proteins have improved on the limitations of antibodies, in particular their rather low production yield and intrinsic stability. Simultaneously, they retain the beneficial properties of antibodies, namely specific and tight

binding. Structural biologists likewise have a great interest in using these molecules as chaperones in crystallization. In this review, we focus on one scaffold, the DARPins. The potential of DARPins as promising compounds in drug discovery and drug development has been reviewed recently (Stumpp and Amstutz, 2007). We examine the five recently determined X-ray structures of DARPin complexes and address several questions concerning DARPin-target interactions. The diversity of the successfully chosen antigens is paralleled by the diversity of the interaction partners of natural ankyrin repeat proteins, which indicates that the technology can be generally applied to a very broad range of target molecules. Drawbacks of Antibodies The main advantage of antibodies is their ability to recognize a wide range of target molecules with high affinity and specificity. Besides proteins, antibodies can bind compounds such as peptides, sugars and small molecules. However, natural antibodies are complex multidomain molecules not well suited for cocrystallization due to their flexible linker regions between domains and their bivalent character. Therefore, only antibody fragments have been applied for cocrystallization purposes. Fab or Fv fragments contain the complete antigen recognition sites and are therefore sufficient to retain the specific antibody-antigen interaction. Nevertheless, these fragments often derive from monoclonal antibodies, and their classical production by hybridoma technology is time-consuming, expensive, and based on the use of living organisms. The selection using recombinant and synthetic libraries have facilitated their generation (Rothe et al., 2008) and led to successful structure determinations (Fellouse et al., 2007; Fellouse et al., 2005; Fellouse et al., 2004; Ye et al., 2008) but the complicated multidomain molecular architecture with disulfide bonds still complicates their handling, limits their use in reducing environments and requires special production precautions in bacterial expression systems such as expression in the periplasm to guarantee the correct disulfide

bond formation. This often affects the production yield since the volume of the periplasm is limited. Despite these difficulties there are numerous structures in complex with soluble target proteins (Bentley, 1996) as well as more demanding membrane proteins (Hunte and Michel, 2002) but the problems associated with all antibody-derived crystallization chaperones inspire continuously to search for alternative binding proteins with similar binding capabilities but superior properties regarding structure, stability and throughput. What Are DARPins? DARPins are derived from the ankyrin repeat motif present in numerous naturally occurring proteins. In nature, ankyrin repeat containing proteins are involved in a wide variety of biological activities and are present in all three superkingdoms (Bork, 1993). Best documented is their involvement in specific protein-protein interactions. The diversity of their roles in a cellular context is further reflected in their localization, which can be the nucleus, cytoplasm, and the extracellular space, where these proteins interact with a large diversity of partners. The number of repeats presented in a single ankyrin repeat protein and thus involved in binding is highly variable so that ankyrin domains can bind to host target molecules that vary considerably in size and shape. The 33-residue sequence motif of an ankyrin repeat forms a well-defined architecture, consisting of a b turn, followed by a pair of antiparallel a helices and a loop that builds the connection to the next repeat (Figure 1A). The characteristic secondary structure components fold into an L-shaped conformation where the helices form the stem and the loop projects outward at an angle of about 90 . Not uncommon are insertions between or within repeats, mainly in the b turn/loop region (Sedgwick and Smerdon, 1999). These insertions can be either a short helical segment or more complex motifs. The fully assembled ankyrin domain is elongated and slightly curved, manifested particularly in high repeat number ankyrin repeat proteins (Figure 1B). In

Review
naturally occurring complexes involving ankyrin repeat proteins, the concave surface, formed by the b turn and the first a helix, is commonly involved in binding the target molecules as shown by the X-ray structures determined to date: p16INK4a-CDK6 (Russo et al., 1998), p19INK4d-CDK6 (Brotherton et al., 1998; Russo et al., 1998), GABPa-GABPb-DNA (Batchelor et al., 1998), IkBa-NFkB (Huxford et al., 1998; Jacobs and Harrison, 1998; Malek et al., 2003), p18INK4c-CDK6 (Jeffrey et al., 2000), CSLNotch-Mastermind (Wilson and Kovall, 2006), Nas6-Rpt3 (Nakamura et al., 2007b), and Gankyrin-S6 (Nakamura et al., 2007a). ¨ Recently, Pluckthun and coworkers have chosen the traits of ankyrin repeat proteins for consensus-based protein library design (Binz et al., 2003). Heeding the lessons of nature, they created DNA libraries that encode DARPins consisting of different numbers of repeat modules and special capping repeats attached to the N and C termini of the protein (Figure 1B). Therefore, the molecules are termed NxC, where x indicates the number of ankyrin repeat modules. The consensus-designed idealized repeat module consists of conserved residues essential for the formation and stabilization of the repeat module itself and the interrepeat stacking interactions. These positions are invariant and build the framework of the individual repeats. In addition, positions not contributing to the structural integrity of the basic fold were defined to be adaptive surface residues (Figure 1A). These residues are positioned at the typical interface region of the natural ankyrin repeat, namely the tip of the b turn and along the exposed surface of the first a-helix (Figure 1C). At these positions, the introduced diversification allows any amino acid except proline and glycine (structurally unfavorable) and cysteine (could form unwanted disulfide bonds). This design resulted in a virtually unlimited repertoire of molecular surfaces. Selection Process Rapid and easy production is a prerequisite for alternative scaffolds suitable for cocrystallization. Repeat protein libraries (Binz et al., 2004; Binz et al., 2003) can be selected using powerful library selection technologies such as ribosome display (RD) ¨ (Hanes and Pluckthun, 1997) or phage display (Smith, 1985), finally yielding specific binders to the target protein. RD is a complete in vitro technology based on in vitro translation in which noncovalent ternary complexes consisting of mRNA, ribosome, and nascent protein chain are formed. These ternary complexes can then be tested for binding to a particular target protein. This system thereby guarantees the coupling of the genotype (mRNA) to the phenotype (protein) and allows immediate access to the genetic information of the binders. To achieve this, the coding sequence of the protein is genetically fused to a C-terminal spacer, allowing the correct folding of the nascent polypeptide chain, and the construct lacks a Stop codon, thus preventing release of the mRNA and the polypeptide from the ribosome. Low temperature and high concentrations of magnesium further stabilize the ternary complexes. The disassembly of the complexes results from depletion of magnesium, and the DNA is recovered via reverse transcription. RD is particularly well suited for large libraries, because no transformation steps limit the applicable library size. Furthermore, as a cell-free system, it enables the selection of cytotoxic proteins or of proteins with limited in vivo stability. All the DARPin binders presented here were isolated from an N3C library and were selected by RD. DARPin binders could also be successfully selected from an N2C library, but these did not yield crystals. Ankyrin repeat proteins consisting of four to five repeats in total are very abundant in nature (Bork, 1993) and also many of the solved natural ankyrin repeat structures in complex with their target display such repeat numbers. The target proteins chosen here were all recombinantly expressed, purified, and either in vivo-biotinylated at a specific lysine in the AviTag sequence (MBP, APH, and Caspase-2), in vitro-biotinylated at diverse lysines on the surface (AcrB), or GST-tagged (Plk-1) for immobilization. Within a few RD cycles (usually 3 to 4), it was possible to enrich the resulting residual library with proteins that specifically and with high affinity bind to the target. A subset of the DARPins obtained by RD was then tested individually for binding using approaches suitable for the particular target protein or the intended use of the binder. For MBP (Binz et al., 2004) and Plk-1 (Bandeiras et al., 2008), a standard ELISA was applied to identify a high-affinity binder. In the case of caspase-2, an in vitro enzymatic activity test combined with a standard ELISA yielded an inhibitor (Schweizer et al., 2007). For APH (Amstutz et al., 2005; Kohl et al., 2005) and AcrB (Sennhauser et al., 2007), an in vivo assay was applied in which the inhibition of the target protein through the DARPins resulted in hypersusceptibility of the bacteria. Normally, the DNA of around 20 DARPins obtained from these assays was sequenced per target. The pools often seemed already quite enriched, revealing groups with similar sequences, although identical sequences were rarely observed. Depending on the sequence variability, five to ten complexes were then purified (yields between 50 and 200 mg/l), characterized, and subjected to crystallization. Structures of DARPins in Complex with Different Antigens Maltose-Binding Protein: Proof of Principle As a model protein for the approach of selecting a specific DARPin protein by RD, the maltose binding protein from Escherichia coli was chosen and represents the first successful example for the selection and crystallization of a particular target protein in complex with a DARPin. The structure of the complex ° was determined at 2.3 A resolution and the phases for this structure could be determined using a known structure of an unselected DARPin previously solved (Kohl et al., 2003). This was possible because the size of the DARPin (18 kDa) relative to the size of maltose-binding protein (MBP) (43 kDa) was appropriate, and there was only one complex in the asymmetric unit. Off7 binds the open form of MBP not involving the sugar-binding cleft but binding three helices at one side of the elongated MBP (Figure 2A). Four lysines forming a positive surface patch which account for 60% of the buried surface area of MBP upon complexation interact closely with off7 (Figure 3A). This first structure showed that the interface between the selected DARPin off7 and MBP indeed involves primarily residues from all three randomized repeat modules, with the randomized repeat module 2 contributing most to the binding (Figure 4A). The two capping repeats are not involved in the interaction. The binding interface is comparable to the lower limit of natural proteinprotein interactions (Jones and Thornton, 1996) (Table 1) and is formed by the concave surface of off7 and a convex surface of

MBP. It involves mainly amino acids at the randomized positions. Off7 contains three framework mutations, of which one (H125Y) is involved in MBP binding. The interface on the DARPin is further characterized by seven aromatic residues, four of which are tyrosines, which account for 72% of the buried surface area of off7 upon complexation. Aminoglycoside Phosphotransferase (30 )-IIIa: The First Inhibiting DARPin The bacterial kinase aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (30 )IIIa (APH) mediates antibiotic resistance to many pathogenic bacteria and is structurally homologous to eukaryotic protein kinases. A highly affine and potent intracellular kinase inhibitory DARPin, named 3a, was selected (Amstutz et al., 2005), and the structure of APH/3a with bound ADP was determined at a resolu° tion of 2.15 A with two heterodimeric complexes in the asymmetric unit. The DARPin binds to two helical segments in the C-terminal lobe of APH (Figures 2B and 3B). On the DARPin surface, the interaction residues are located mainly on the N-terminal capping repeat, on repeat modules 1 and 2, and, to a lesser extent, on module 3 (Figure 4A). As for MBP/off7, there are no interactions involving the C-terminal capping repeat, and as a consequence there was only weak density visible for this part of the molecule, indicating flexibility. Whereas the structure of the DARPin is not affected by the binding (Figure 4B), 3a binds to the two helices A and B in the a-helical C-terminal lobe of APH, thereby stabilizing helix D in a conformation unable to bind substrate (Figure 5A). In addition, the aminoglycoside positioning loop connecting helices A and B is disordered. Therefore, the structure of the C-terminal lobe of the complex differs significantly from the structure of APH alone. This affects in particular the C-terminal amino acid Phe264 of helix D which is critically involved in substrate binding as revealed by the kanamycin A bound APH structure (Hon et al., 1997). In the DARPin complex, this interaction is distorted, and thus the enzyme is unable to bind the antibiotic. Polo-Like Kinase-1: An Arduously Crystallizable Target The Ser/Thr protein kinase polo-like kinase-1 (Plk-1) is a key regulator of mitosis and is a well-validated drug target in cancer therapy. Crystallization attempts for various constructs of the wild-type kinase domain of Plk-1 using a multiparallel cloning and expression approach have failed in the past. Therefore, binders from a DARPin library selective for Plk-1 have been generated and have been used in cocrystallization trials. In this way, the first structure of wild-type apo Plk-1 could be determined in ° complex with the DARPin 3H10 at 2.3 A resolution with two complexes in the asymmetric unit. The DARPin binds to the C-terminal lobe of the kinase directly below the ATP binding site (Figure 2C). The binding epitope recognized by DARPin 3H10 is especially rich in Arg, Lys, and Glu residues (66% of the buried surface area) enabling crystallization by masking a surface patch of Plk-1 that is unfavorable for forming crystal contacts similar to the surface residue mutation method (Figure 3C). Such residues have high conformational freedom and are considered counterproductive for crystal contact formation due to a loss of entropy (Derewenda and Vekilov, 2006). As revealed by isothermal calorimetry measurements, the overall interaction is endothermic and apparently driven by entropy alone. The three repeat modules are solely responsible for the interaction, and again there are mainly residues at the randomized

positions involved (Figure 4A). The N-terminal capping repeat is not involved in binding. Interestingly, the C-terminal capping repeat is fully disordered in the structure either due to the binding of the kinase or due to clashings with the noncrystallographic symmetry-related DARPin during crystal formation.

exclusively for caspase-2. The structure of the caspase-2/F8 ° complex at 3.24 A resolution revealed the molecular basis for the specificity as well as the allosteric mechanism of inhibition which was also verified by kinetic analysis. The asymmetric unit contained three caspase-2 dimers with two bound DARPins each (Figure 2D). The main contact surface of caspase-2 is formed by the 381 loop, involving diverse residues (Figure 3D). Minor interactions involve the N-terminus of the other b-subunit of the caspase. Regarding F8, all three repeat modules and one framework residue in the N-terminal capping repeat are forming the interface on F8 (Figure 4A). The 381 loop forms one side of the active site cleft (Figure 5B). The conformation of this loop is slightly shifted when compared

with the caspase-2/peptide inhibitor structure (Schweizer et al., 2003), resulting in an opening of the active site cleft. Additional rearrangements in the surrounding of the active site cleft and the side chain of Tyr79 of F8 occupying partly the substrate subpocket S5 of caspase-2 are the main reasons for the inhibitory property of F8. The caspase-2/F8 complex shows that the allosteric inhibition of caspase-2 is extremely specific, which has significant advantages over orthosteric ligands which often lack specificity.

major system contributing to efflux-caused drug resistance in this organism. This protein actively detoxifies the intracellular space by exporting drugs to the cell exterior while importing protons. To explain the molecular mechanism of this process, the availability of high-resolution structural information is a prerequisite. For this, and to show the applicability of the DARPin combinatorial libraries and of the ribosome display selection method to membrane proteins, AcrB was chosen as model system. Although AcrB can be crystallized on its own due to its large periplasmic domain protruding from the lipid bilayer, the crystals of ° the AcrB/110819 complex diffracted to 2.54 A resolution, substantially better than all the previously published crystals of AcrB alone (Murakami et al., 2002). In the structure, the DARPin binds to the periplasmic part of AcrB and due to the distinctly different conformations of the subunits only two DARPins bind to the trimeric protein (Figure 2E). The epitope on AcrB is mainly formed by a b sheet connecting the pore domain with the TolC docking domain, which are subdomains of the periplasmic portion of the protein (Figure 3E). An additional interaction is formed involving a helical segment and a b strand of the adjacent preceding subunit of AcrB via hydrophobic interactions and two hydrogen bonds. All five repeats (including both capping repeats) of the DARPin are involved in the interaction (Figure 4A). Comprising around ° 1100 A2 buried surface area on both the DARPin and AcrB, and 68 residues in total, this complex showed the largest buried surface area for a DARPin complex so far (Table 1). Interestingly, the structure revealed a new conformation of the molecule where the three subunits of AcrB were locked in different conformations, revealing distinct channels in each subunit. Furthermore, the structure indicated how in the protein the coupling between the channel access, exit, and the putative proton translocation site is achieved. It suggests a transport pathway through the identified channels in the individual subunits by a rotary mechanism. At the same time, this new conformation was also observed without a bound DARPin by two individual groups (Murakami et al., 2006; Seeger et al., 2006). In further studies, DARPin 110819 also allowed the crystallization of otherwise uncrystallizable mutants (K.M. Pos, unpublished data). General Properties of DARPin-Target Interfaces The structural properties forming the surface of the target proteins recognized by DARPins vary from complex to complex (Figure 2). A common trait between the different interfaces, however, is the overall curvature of the target protein interface area enclosed by DARPins. This curvature is complementary to the curvature of the randomized surface area of the DARPin. Furthermore, all three internal randomized repeat modules are involved in the interaction in all five complexes (Figure 4A). As set out in the design, the predominant interaction is mediated by residues in the randomized positions (Figure 4C); this is the reason for the high specificity of the selected molecules. Interestingly, the last residue of the individual repeat module, namely randomized position 33, is not involved in any interface. In contrast, position 3 is heavily buried in most of the repeat modules. In all complexes, framework residues also participate in the interaction with the target protein. In the case of the MBP and AcrB binders, there is a mutated framework position H125Y and D155N, respectively, contributing to the interaction. Such framework mutations can be explained as a result of the numerous PCR cycles the DARPin-encoding DNA passes during the selection process. The involvement of the capping repeats in the interface differs greatly between the different complexes. Whereas the N-terminal capping repeat is well ordered in all structures and involved in binding in the APH, caspase-2, and AcrB complexes, the C-terminal capping repeat is fully disordered in the Plk-1 complex and partially disordered in the APH and caspase-2 complex. It is solely involved in the interface of the AcrB/110819 complex, where 7 residues of the C-terminal capping repeat are participating in the interface. In having the first interacting residue at position 13 and the last at position 157, the full width of the 169 amino acid residue DARPin is used in this complex. This provides the most extensive interaction described to date. The structures discussed here show that DARPins are not restricted to recognize any specific amino acid sequence or structure on the target. In all cases, the DARPins recognize native, nonlinear epitopes (Figure 3). There is no particular chemical character found neither for the epitopes (target interface) nor for the paratopes (DARPin interface). There are numerous aromatic residues on the paratopes, but they seem to be less preferred than in antibody paratopes (Padlan, 1990). An exception is the MBP-off7 complex where the aromatic residues account for 72% of the buried surface area of the DARPin. The proportion of aromatic residues in the epitopes is low, a fact that has been observed in antibody-antigen interactions as well (Davies and Cohen, 1996). Furthermore, charged residues seem to be important for the interaction, accounting for nearly half of the contact residues of the epitopes. Whereas all DARPins described here are composed of five repeat modules, the total interface sizes on the target molecules differ widely. The MBP/ off7 complex presents by far the smallest interface, comprising 40 residues and a combined buried surface area of only ° 1264 A2 (Table 1). In contrast, the largest interface observed in the AcrB/110819 complex comprises 63 and 68 residues and ° buries 1986 and 2328 A2 of the AcrB surface in the two interfaces formed; all other complex interfaces are in between these values. However, the interface sizes show great similarities to naturally occurring ankyrin repeat protein, heterodimeric protein-protein, and antibody-antigen complexes (Table 1). Structural Rearrangements in the Target Proteins and the DARPins An often raised argument in the field of chaperone-assisted crystallization is that binders might induce a conformational change in the target molecules. Because the crystal structures of all target proteins chosen are also available without a binding partner, it is possible to investigate conformational changes of the targets on DARPin binding. The structures of MBP in the open conformation without a ligand (PDB ID code: 1LLS [Rubin et al., 2002]) and complexed MBP are very similar, with an overall Ca ° rmsd below 1 A. Also, in the case of AcrB, the structures obtained in 2006 (Murakami et al., 2006; Seeger et al., 2006) are remarkably similar, considering the size of the protein (rmsd for ° 3110 Ca atoms 1 A). In addition, the observed asymmetry in the crystal structure could also be detected in solution (Sennhauser et al., 2007). The overall structure of Plk-1 is also very similar to two structures of a mutant solved at the same time,

Figure 6. Diverse Crystal Contacts Mediated by DARPins
(A) Crystal packing in the MBP-DARPin complex. The crystals belong to space group P21. One complex is shown in ribbon representation and colored dark blue (MBP) and green (DARPin). The neighboring molecules are shown in worm representation in light blue and purple. Crystal contacts are mediated mainly between adjacent DARPin and MBP molecules. (B) Crystal contacts of AcrB molecules and DARPins. The crystals belong to space group P212121. The AcrB subunits A, B, and C are colored dark blue, light blue, and gray, respectively. One of the two DARPins (in green) bound to the periplasmic part of AcrB mediates essential crystal contacts to the cytoplasmic part of a symmetry-related trimer, resulting in a different packing to AcrB crystallized without a DARPin. (C) Asymmetric unit content of the Plk-1/DARPin crystal. The two complexes are shown in ribbon representation and are colored gray and blue (Plk-1) and purple and green (DARPin). The N- and C-terminal ends are labeled.

each harboring a different ligand (Kothe et al., 2007), again indicating that there is no binding protein induced conformational change. The interaction of the DARPin inhibitors with APH and caspase-2 revealed conformations in which the target proteins were inactive. This information is useful for finding novel ways to inhibit the function of an enzyme. The structural rearrangements there are quite considerable. In APH, helices A, B, and D are significantly shifted with respect to kanamycin A-bound APH (Hon et al., 1997), and the aminoglycoside positioning loop connecting helices A and B is disordered (Figure 5A). In caspase-2, the loops surrounding the active site cleft are altered when compared with the caspase-2/peptide inhibitor structure (Schweizer et al., 2003), resulting in an opening of the active site cleft (Figure 5B). Nevertheless, we do not believe that these structural rearrangements are caused by the DARPin, resulting in an induced fit. Recalling the DARPin selection strategy, it is more likely that the DARPins only bind to epitopes as presented by the target proteins in a ``lock and key''-like fashion. In this way, the selected DARPins can not only bind to proteins in their predominant conformation but can also trap the proteins in conformations that are probably present in solution but are less populated, thus inhibiting an enzyme in an allosteric way. In all structures, the differences in the DARPin scaffold are minimal upon binding and showed no essential rearrangements of the global fold compared with an unselected DARPin alone (Kohl et al., 2003) (Figure 4B). In agreement with the participation of the individual repeats in the interaction, the strongest flexibility can be observed in the C-terminal capping repeat. In the DARPin-binding Plk-1, the C-terminal capping repeat cannot even be localized in the crystal structure. The b turn regions of the individual repeat modules also show some minor adaptations when bound to a target protein. DARPin-Mediated Crystal Contacts The potential of DARPins to provide crystal contacts is best described for the MBP/off7 and the AcrB/110819 complex. As shown in Figure 6A, in the MBP/off7 complex the lattice interactions involve only DARPin-DARPin and MBP-MBP contacts,

which occur within layers, and the direct binding interface between the two interaction partners is the sole contact form between the layers. In the crystal formed by the AcrB/110819 complex, crystal contacts are mediated by the DARPin in such a way that, in addition to the interaction with the periplasmic domain of its target, the convex side of the DARPin simultaneously forms crystal contacts to the cytoplasmic polar surface of a symmetry-related molecule of AcrB (Figure 6B). Because the crystal has the space group P212121, this contact critically contributes to the stability of the lattice (the mentioned contact occurs in all three dimensions) and thus to the higher diffraction limits of the complex crystal over the crystal formed by AcrB alone. There are some proteins that could be crystallized only when complexed to a cognate Fab fragment (Laver et al., 1990). A similar case is Plk-1 that alone in its apo-form--a structure most useful for drug design--did not crystallize. In complex with the DARPin 3H10, however, Plk-1 did crystallize. Surprisingly, the DARPin makes direct crystal contacts to the other DARPin in the asymmetric unit via the third repeat module as the C-terminal capping repeat is fully disordered (Figure 6C). It is worth mentioning that cocrystallization with a DARPin clearly was advantageous in the cases of AcrB and Plk-1, whereas the opposite was true for caspase-2. Here, the diffrac° tion quality of the DARPin complex was clearly worse (3.24 A) ° than caspase-2 in complex with a peptide inhibitor (1.65 A) (Schweizer et al., 2003). DARPins containing different numbers of internal repeats might be selected to obtain better diffracting crystals. Conclusions We have reviewed the recent results using DARPins as crystallization tools to crystallize difficult target proteins to understand the natural and alternative conformations of these proteins. DARPins are a class of designed binding molecules that represent a very promising alternative to antibodies. They retain the affinity and specificity of antibodies but are far more stable, and their simple architecture allows high-yield bacterial production. Their use in biomedical and biotechnological research is

Review
considerably more advantageous over antibodies. High-affinity DARPins to a given target can rapidly be selected from very large libraries within a few weeks. The use of in vitro selection systems such as phage or ribosome display represents an advantage over the traditional production of monoclonal antibodies in test animals, as the binders are selected to a native protein under defined buffer conditions. Therefore, the in vitro display techniques guarantee that surface epitopes of the presented target protein are selected. The use in structural biology is obvious from the structures described here, and not only enables crystallization of soluble and membrane proteins but also reveals conformations of the target proteins that otherwise are not detected when inhibitors are selected. In the cases of DARPin inhibitors of caspase-2 and APH, the crystals of the complex did not diffract better; rather, the diffraction was worse than that of crystals of the target proteins with small molecule compounds bound to the active site. However, in both cases a conformation of the target protein was revealed in which the protein is inactive. This information is useful for finding new ways to modulate target protein function. To expand the applicability of the technology in protein crystallography, heavy atom sites can be engineered into the capping repeats. Crystals of target proteins with a heavy atomloaded DARPin is a great help in phasing using the single anomalous dispersion method. This has already been success¨ fully applied using a DARPin-MBP complex crystal (A. Pluckthun ¨ and M.G.Grutter, unpublished data). In conclusion, DARPins have the potential to (1) provide crystals of a target protein that is difficult to crystallize, (2) provide better diffracting crystals of the complex when the target protein alone only poorly diffracts, (3) provide initial phases for molecular replacement in cases where the DARPin and the target protein are not too different in size, (4) provide phases by single anomalous dispersion for complexes formed with heavy atom loaded DARPins, and (5) reveal new insight into the function of a target protein by stabilizing a conformation that in solution is less populated.
