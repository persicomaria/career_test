The principal products formed in the initial stages of the dinitrophenylation of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A are 41-DNP-ribonuclease, I-DNP-ribonuclease, 1,41-bis-DNP-ribonuclease and 7,41-bis-DNP-ribonuclease. These proteins may be separated by chromatography over columns of IRC-50. The location of the substituent in 41-DNP-ribonuclease A was demonstrated: (a) by comparative chromatography of tryptic hydrolysates of the performic acid-oxidized protein and oxidized ribonuclease A, and (b) by isolation of the peptide CySOtH-e-DNP-Lys-Pro-Val-AsnThr-Phe from a hydrolysate prepared by the successive action of trypsin and chymotrypsin on the oxidized protein. Identification of 1-DNP-ribonuclease was made by isolation of the peptide a-DNP-Lys-Glu-Thr from a combined tryptic and chymotryptic hydrolysate of the oxidized enzyme. Identification of 1,41-bis-DNP-ribonuclease and 7,41-bis-DNP-ribonuclease were made by the same approach. Substitution at position 7 was established by isolation of the peptides c-DNP-Lys-Phe and c-DNP-Lys-Phe-Glu-Arg.

The initial phases of the dinitrophenylation of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (acetate) at pH 8 are dominated by substitutions at the c-amino groups in positions 7 and 41 and at the a-amino group. These substitutions are responsible for the early appearance in the reaction of two monodinitrophenylribonucleases,* l- and 41-DNPribonuclease A, and two bis-dinitrophenylribonucleases, 1,41- and 7,41-bis-DNPribonuclease A (l-3). The identification of the points of substitution in these derivatives is the concern of the present communication.
EXPERIMENTAL

Materials
Enzymes. Trypsinogen (Worthington cal Corporation) was chromatographed by a slight modification of the procedure Biochemion IRC-50 described

by Keller, Cohen, and Neurath (4); a satisfactory separation from contaminating chymotrypsinogen-ol was attained. Trypsinogen was not isolated. Instead, the fractions that comprised the center of the trypsinogen band were combined and activated by addition of 0.1% of the weight of trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, crystallized), at 4" for 24 hours. The chymotrypsin used throughout was a commercial preparation (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, twice crystallized). Dowex 60-X2. The resin (259-400 mesh) was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories. It was converted to the sodium form and prepared for chromatography as described elsewhere (5). Sephadex G-26. The gel (Pharmacia, Inc., "fine'`-particle size) was repeatedly settled in 0.2 M acetic acid. Extremely fine particles were removed by aspiration of the slowly sedimenting fraction.

KYCIA equilibrated with 0.2 J\: sodium formate buffer at pH 3.11 (cf. Spackman, Moore, and Stein (8) for preparation of this buffer). Peptides were separated in gradients of increasing pH and buffer salt concentration as specified in Figs. 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 11. The peptides were detected in suitable aliquots of the effluent fractions by the ninhydrin procedure after preliminary alkaline hydrolysis in polypropylene tubes [cf. accompanying paper (l)]. Dinitrophenyl-peptides were visible on columns of the W-type resin during chromatography and were determined in the effluent by absorbancy measurements at 360 mp in a Beckman DU spectrophotometer. Peptide zones to be subjected to further fractionation were desalted by an ion-exchange method (7) and were obtained as lyophilized powders. Identification of the peptides in a given zone and determination of the yields in which they were formed were accomplished by quantitative amino acid analysis. Prior to hydrolysis, cuts from the effluent were acidified to pH 3 with 12 N HCl [cf. Him (7)]. The combined extract,s were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and the final residue was subjected t,o hydrolysis in an evacuated, sealed tube as indicated in the accompanying paper (1).

Performic Acid Oxidation and Enxymic Cleavage of Oxidized Proteins
A previously described procedure (6) was used t.o achieve oxidation; completeness of the reaction was checked by quantitative amino acid analysis [cf. Hirs, Halmann, and Kycia (l)]. Tryptic hydrolysates were obtained from 1.5 to 3 pmole samples of the proteins with the aid of an enzyme preparat,ion derived by activation of chymotrypsinogen-free trypsinogen. Cleavage was allowed to occur in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and 25" (5) at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:lOO by weight. Combined tryptic and chymotrypt.ic hydrolysates were prepared by the successive action of the two enzymes: the preliminary hydrolysis with trypsin was conducted as described for 24 hours, whereupon chymotrypsin was added to a concentration equal to that of trypsin [cf. Hirs (7)]. The hydrolysis was terminated after a further 24 hours by acidification to pH 2.5.

Representative effluent curves from preparative chromatograms on IRC-50 columns of cuts obtained from a preliminary fractionation of the reaction products [cf. (l), Figs. 3 and 51 are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Contaminants contributed by adjacent zones in the previous stage of purification are satisfactorily separated. The ratio (in arbitrary units normalized at the maxima) of the absorbancy of the fractions at 360 or 400 rnp to the protein concentration as determined either by spectrophotometry or by the ninhydrin reaction proved to be a sensitive indicator of contamination by constituents differing in substitution from the principal component. For example, in Fig. 2 (c), contamination of the front shoulder of the I-DNPRNase band is revealed by the change in this ratio from 1.5 to a value of 1.0, characteristic of the remainder of the band. A further cycle of chromatography under the same conditions afforded products that migrated as single symmetrical zones. At this stage the proteins were considered to be sufficiently homogeneous for chemical studies. However, the presence of minor contaminants could be demonstrated in such preparations by analytical chromatography at very high levels of column loading and by quantitative amino acid analysis. The amino acid compositions of acid hydrolysates of the proteins are presented in Table I, which also includes for comparison the results obtained from RNase A under identical conditions of hydrolysis. The presence of ar-DNP-lysine was established by absorbancy measurements at 360 rnp on the intact proteins, and the results

FIG. 3. Chromatography of peptides in a 24-hour tryptic hydrolysate of 2.5 pmoles of performic acid-oxidized 41-DNP-RNase A. The column of Dowex 50-X2 measured 0.9 X 150 cm and was initially equilibrated with 0.2 N sodium formate buffer at pH 3.11. At 0.2 effluent liters gradient elution was initiated with a closed mixing chamber that contained 540 ml of starting buffer. 1 N sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.1 was allowed to flow into the chamber as far as 0.6 effluent liters, after which the chromatogram was completed with 2 N sodium acetate at pH 5.1 as the concentrated buffer. The temperature of operation was 35" as far as 1.22 effluent liters and 50" beyond that point. The column flow rate was 20 cm/hr and 4 ml fractions were collected.

a The peptides were isolated from corresponding zones of chromatograms on Dowex 50-X2 of the type illustrated in Fig. 3. Compositions are expressed in terms of molar ratios of the constituent amino acids; values less than 0.01 residue are omitted. Principal constituents are indicated in boldface type. The composition of the mixture of peptides 0-Tryp 13 and 0-Tryp 16 derived from oxidized RNase A was calculated on the basis of a throretical analysis for the peptide Phe-Glu-Arg. in the tryptic

hydrolysate was eluted slowly during the fractionation and escaped detection because of extreme "tailing." The peptides absent from the chromatogram, 0-Tryp 9 and 0-Tryp 13, derive from contiguous parts of the amino acid sequence in RNase A (9, 10). Peptide 0-Tryp 13 represents residues 38 to 61 and its presence in tryptic hydrolysates of the oxidized protein reflects the resistance to tryptic attack of the bond between the arginine and cysteic acid residues in positions 39 and 40, respectively. When this bond is cleaved peptides 0-Tryp 7 (residues 3839) and 0-Tryp 9 (residues40-61) are formed. Peptides 0-Tryp 9 and 0-Tryp 13 contain two lysine residues, residues 41 and 61 in the parent protein; of these lysine 61 represents the carboxyl-terminal residue of both peptides. If residue 61 carried the DNP substituent in the modified protein, tryptic cleavage at the carbonyl bond of this residue would subsequently have been blocked and the peptide immediately following peptide

0-Tryp 9 in the sequence, peptide 0-Tryp 5, should not have been present in the hydrolysate. Since 0-Tryp 5 was in fact produced in the same yield as it is from RNase A itself, the DNP substituent could not have been attached at residue 61. This conclusion is supported by the detection of peptide (0-Tryp 9)Chy 7-2-4 (15 % yield), which derives from residues 47-61. It is therefore evident that the lysine residue in position 41 was the one modified. This residue, being followed by proline in the sequence (9), is not the site of tryptic cleavage in oxidized RNase A and substitution of its tamino group was thus not accompanied by a change in the number of lysine bonds attacked. The point of substitution was also identified in experiments on hydrolysates produced by the successiveaction of trypsin and chymotrypsin on the oxidized protein. A preliminary fractionation of the peptides in such hydrolysates was achieved on a relatively short column of Dowex 5OW-X2

with the result shown in Fig. 4. Amino acid analyses of the peptide bands from these chromatograms were interpreted without ambiguity in terms of peptides previously studied in detail (7) and led to the recognition of the principal constituents in each band indicated in Fig. 4. As in the difference experiments the presence of both the peptide Glu-Thr-Ala-Ala-Ala-Lys and Lys-GluThr-Ala-Ala-Ala-Lys, from the amino-terminal segment, of the molecule, revealed that tryptic cleavage had taken place at the carbonyl bond of the lysine residue in position 1.

As shown in Fig. 8 six DNP-peptide zones were present in the effluent of a chromatogram of the enzymic hydrolysate of the oxidized protein on Dowex 5OW-X2. More than 93% of the dinitrophenylated material was present in three

zones, those designated 3, 5 and 6 in Fig. 8. The peptides contributing two strongly retarded zones, 5 and 6, were derived from the same region of the molecule. Analyses (Table III) showed zone 5 to be due to a dipeptide of c-DNP-lysine and phenylalanine. This peptide could only have derived from residues 7 and 8 in RNase A. Zone 6 contained a tetrapeptide (cf. Table III), formed in smaller yield, that contained e-DNP-lysine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, and arginine. This peptide represents residues 7-10. Substitution on the lysine residue in position 7 would prevent the formation of peptide 0-Tryp 15, Phe-Glu-Arg, derived from residues 8-10, on enzymic hydrolysis. The results shown in Fig. 8 reveal the presence of only a relatively minor band at 160 effluent ml, the position at which peptide 0-Tryp 15 appears when it is present (Fig. 4). On analysis this band was found to contain only traces of the amino acids present in peptide 0-Tryp 15. The DNP-peptide zone labeled 3 in Fig.

FIG. 10. Fractionation of the constituents of zone 4 from an experiment of the type illustrated in Fig. 9. The column of Sephadex G-25 described in Fig. 7 was employed.

DNP-peptides in the enzymic hydrolysate of the oxidized protein were not well separated under the conditions of chromatography shown in Fig. 4 and a longer column was required. The two principal peptide zones shown in Fig. 9 accounted for more than 85 % of the dinitrophenylated peptides in the effluent. Table III shows zone 5 was due to the tripeptide a-DNP-Lys-Glu-Thr (residues l-3). The peptides from zone 4 were fractionated on Sephadex G-25 (Fig. 10). As before, the DNP-peptide band moved more slowly than any of the other components. As Table III shows, the band proved to be due to the heptapeptide derived from residues 4046 in the parent protein. The improved resolution of peptides evident in Fig. 9 permitted an unequivocal demonstration of an alteration in the concentration of the peptide 0-Tryp 10, Lys-Glu-Thr-Ala-Ala-Ala-Lys (residues l-7) in the hydrolysate. Figure 11 shows this peptide appeared at 210 effluent ml when a hydrolysate from oxidized RNase A was chromatographed under the same conditions. Comparison of Fig. 9 and Fig. 11 indicates that the peptide was present at

about >fo its usual concentration after the protein had been modified. Purity of DNP-RNases. The results shown in Fig. 4 leave little room for doubt that but a single DNP-peptide was formed on degradation of 41-DNP-RNase A and that, therefore, the protein was not contaminated with isomeric monosubstitution products. By contrast, the presence of additional DNP-peptide zones in Fig. 6 may be attributed to nonspecific cleavage or to the presence of contaminating isomers in the preparation isolated. On the assumption of contamination, the results in Fig. 6 may be used to calculate that the preparation of 1-DNP-RNase A isolated contained 10 % of monosubstitution products other than the principal component. Similar calculations with the results shown in Figs. 8 and 9 reveal about 5% contamination of 7,41-bis-DNP-RNase A and 15 % contamination of 1,41-bis-DNP-RNase A by isomerit bis-substitution products.

tion. At higher levels of substitution, however, irreversible adsorption prevents effective chromatography of the products, which can be seen to streak out on the column. It is we11 known that DNP groups confer a pronounced affinity for the hydrocarbon matrix of synthetic ion-exchange resins and it is probable that this is the principal deterrent to chromatography of the poly-DNP-RNases on IRC-50. The introduction of D?\TP groups eliminates positive charges on the protein. Thus, if the forces between the resin and the protein were dominated by electrostatic contributions, dinitrophenylation would be expected to lead to a diminished affinity for the resin. Moreover, it is unlikely that the failure of poly-DNP-RNases to chromatograph on IRC-50 is due to unfolding of the molecule. When the chromatography of RNase A itself is performed at temperatures at which the molecule is extensively unfolded, normal chromatographic behavior is observed (2, 12), although the protein is very significantly retarded on the column. Lyophilization from acetic acid solutions

is detrimental to the recovery of mono- and disubstitution products from IRC-50 columns. Since heating above the transition temperature of RSase A reverses the effects of lyophilization, it is probable that the DNP-proteins aggregate in the same manner as RNase A itself (13). The DNP-Rn'ases exhibit the spectral properties to be expected from their constituent chromophores. The DNP group in 41-DNP-RT\`ase A contributes an absorption maximum at 365 rnp, with a molar absorptivity of 15.1 X 103. Experience has shown that the spectral properties must be measured with freshly prepared samples because the DNP-proteins are photosensitive. For this reason, it is uncertain whether small differences observed in the structure of the absorption band in the near ultra-violet for the various dinitrophenylribonucleases are due to deterioration of the preparations. The chromatography of DNP-peptides on ion-exchange resins has proved troublesome in the past. The remarkable affinity of the peptide c-DNP-Lys-Phe for Dowex 5OW-X2 is illustrated in Fig. 8. In this particular instance, an excellent recovery of the peptide was obtained in spite of its very slow mobility on the column. As would be expected from the results of Kimmel [as quoted by Schroeder et al. (14)], this peptide had a much higher mobility when chromatography was performed with eluents of the same pH and ionic strength, but in which the weak base pyridine was incorporated. For the routine isolation of the peptide CySOSH-c-DKP-Lys-Pro-ValAsn-Thr-Phe (residues 40-46) in recent experiments performed by Dr. A. Burdock in this laboratory, it has proved more convenient to fractionate the enzymic hydrolysates directly on columns of Sephadex G-25. The proteolytic cleavages responsible for the formation of the peptides ar-DNP-LysGlu-Thr and t-DNP-Lys-Phe were not predicted from the results obtained in the tryptic and chymotryptic hydrolysis of oxidized RNase A itself (7). The altered specificity of proteolytic action after modification of the substrate is of considerable interest. While at present unexplained, the

results indicate the need for caution in the interpretation of differences in electrophoretic and chromatographic patterns of the peptides derived from native and modified proteins.
