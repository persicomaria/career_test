ABSTRACT: Residues of opposite charge often populate heptad positions g (heptad i on chain 1) and e (heptad i + 1 on chain 2) in dimeric coiled coils and may stabilize the dimer by formation of interchain ion pairs. To investigate the contribution to stability of such electrostatic interactions we have designed a disulfide-linked heterodimeric zipper (AB zipper) consisting of the acidic chain Ac-E-VAQLEKEVAQAEAE-NYQLEQE-VAQLEHE-CG-NH2 and the basic chain Ac-E-VQALKKR-VQALKARNYAAKQK-VQALRHK-CG-NH2 in which all e and g positions are occupied by either E or K/R to form a maximum of seven interhelical salt bridges. Temperature-induced denaturation experiments monitored by circular dichroism reveal a stable coiled coil conformation below 50 °C and in the pH range 1.2-8.0. Stability is highest at pH  4.0 [GU (37 °C) ) 5.18 ( 0.51 kcal mol-1]. The solution structure of the AB zipper at pH 5.65 has been elucidated on the basis of homonuclear 1H NMR data collected at 800 MHz [heavy atom rmsd's for the ensemble of 50 calculated structures are 0.47 ( 0.13 Å (backbone) and 0.95 ( 0.16 Å (all)]. Both chains of the AB zipper are almost entirely in R-helical conformation and form a superhelix with a left-handed twist. Overhauser connectivities reveal close contacts between g position residues (heptad i on chain 1) and residues d/f (heptad i on chain 1), residues a/d (heptad i + 1 on chain 1), and residue a (heptad i + 1 on chain 2). Residues in position e (heptad i on chain 1) are in contact with residues a/b/d/f (heptad i on chain 1) and residue d (heptad i on chain 2). These connectivities hint at a relatively defined alignment of the side chains across the helix interface. Partial H-bond formation between the functional groups of residues g and e(+1) is observed in the calculated structures. NMR pH titration experiments disclose pKa values for Glu -carboxylate groups: 4.14 ( 0.02 (E1), 4.82 ( 0.07 (E6), 4.52 ( 0.01 (E8), 4.37 ( 0.03 (E13), 4.11 ( 0.02 (E15), 4.41 ( 0.07 (E20), 4.82 ( 0.03 (E22), 4.65 ( 0.04 (E27), 4.63 ( 0.03 (E29), 4.22 ( 0.02 (E1). By comparison with pKa of Glu in unfolded peptides (4.3 ( 0.1), our pKa data suggest marginal or even unfavorable contribution of charged Glu to the stability of the AB zipper. The electrostatic energy gained from interhelical ion pairs is likely to be surpassed by hydrophobic energy terms upon protonation of Glu, due to increased hydrophobicity of uncharged Glu and, thus, better packing against apolar residues at the chain interface.

Two-stranded R-helical coiled coils, proposed by Crick in 1953 (1), have been identified in a wide variety of proteins such as transcription factors (2) and fibrous proteins (3). In basic transcription factors (bZIP),1 the coiled coil forming domain (zipper domain) comprises 30-40 residues and is located at the C-terminal end of the protein next to a basic DNA binding segment. Dimerization and binding to DNA of the bZIP occur simultaneously and are largely mediated by the formation of a stable coiled coil structure (4-6). The strength of DNA,,,bZIP interaction therefore strongly depends on the capability of the zipper domain to establish a stable dimeric coiled coil. The superhelix formation of the zipper domain has its origin in several repeats of a seven-residue sequence motif (abcdefg)n: positions a and d are frequently occupied by

Coiled Coil: NMR Structure and Glu pKa Values located at the interface of the juxtaposed helices pack according to a "knobs-into-holes" model (1). The kinetics of folding and the coupled thermodynamic stability of the dimeric zipper are highly dependent on the type of residues in positions a, d, e, and g shaping the interface of the coiled coil (16-22). In many bZIPs, one hydrophobic residue located in the a position of a central heptad is substituted by polar Asn interrupting the hydrophobic interface. It has been shown that Asn in such position is slightly destabilizing the coiled coil and preventing the formation of higher order polymers (8, 16, 17, 23, 24). Although the driving force for the stabilization of the coiled coil structure is the hydrophobic packing of a and d as well as e and g position residues at the chain interface, the latter are also thought to play an important role in stabilizing/destabilizing the dimeric zipper by imposing attractive/repulsive interhelical electrostatic interactions. It has been well-established that ionic repulsion among g and e(+1) residues2 prevents the formation of stable dimers (21, 22, 25-28). While intrahelical ion pairs between residues spaced i, i + 3, and i, i + 4 might stabilize the coiled coil (29, 30), the occurrence of interhelical g,,,e(+1) salt bridges and their contribution to stability of coiled coils is under debate (31, 32). Double mutant cycle studies on designed coiled coils suggest favorable electrostatic energy terms at neutral pH resulting from interhelical ion pairing between g and e(+1) position residues (33), Glu,,,Arg being more stabilizing than Glu,,,Lys (34). The contribution of an ionizable group to the free energy of folding (GF) is reflected in the difference in the pKa value determined for the folded and unfolded protein (32, 35). In the crystal structure of GCN4, two interchain salt bridges are apparent (8). However, relative to the unfolded protein, NMR pH titration experiments reveal very minor shifts of pKa values, indicative of negligible contribution of the charged residues to stability (36). Continuum electrostatics calculations on the mono- and dimeric helices of the GCN4 crystal structure disclose unfavorable desolvation effects upon docking of the helices that largely exceed the electrostatic energy gained by interhelical ion pairs (30). Furthermore, determination of Glu pKa values in matrilin-1 (37) and kinetic studies on oppositely charged dimeric zippers (20) suggest no or only minor favorable contributions of interhelical ion pairs to protein stability. To gain more detailed insight into the complex interdependence between electrostatic and hydrophobic effects in coiled coils, we have begun a systematic study on the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding of a designed heterodimeric, disulfide-linked coiled coil called AB zipper. It is composed of an acidic and a basic peptide chain in which all e/g positions are occupied by either Glu or Lys/Arg, enabling the formation of seven interchain ion pairs (Figure 1). In this paper, we report the high-resolution solution structure of the AB zipper solved on the basis of 1H NMR data recorded at 800 MHz. pKa values of all 10 Glu residues in the zipper have been determined and are discussed with respect to structural data and the pH dependence of the coiled coil stability investigated by thermal unfolding.

knowledge, this is the first study to report Glu pKa values for each e and g heptad position in a dimeric coiled coil. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Peptide Synthesis and Purification. Peptides A and B were synthesized on a Perkin-Elmer ABI 433 A solid-phase peptide synthesizer using the Rink amide methylbenzhydrylamine resin (38) from Novabiochem (Laufelfingen, Swit¨ zerland), the Fmoc protection strategy, and HBTU coupling. Removal of the N-terminal Fmoc group, N-terminal acetylation, deprotection of side chains, except for S-(tert-butylthio)Cys, and the release of the peptides from the resin as C-terminal amides were performed as described (20-22). Removal of the tert-butyl-thio protection group from Cys occurred by incubation in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of DTT in water at 55 °C for 18 h. Final purification was achieved by size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 column and by HPLC (Hewlett-Packard 1100) using a C18 column (Machery-Nagel Nucleosil, 250 × 10 mm, 100 Å pore size, 5 µm particle size) and linear acetonitrile gradient from 24 to 48% (slope of 0.53% min-1; flow rate of 1.2 mL min-1). To obtain the disulfide-linked AB zipper, 10 mg of both peptides dissolved in 10 mL of 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8, were gently stirred for 48 h at RT while exposed to the air; the product was purified by HPLC as described above. Electrospray mass analysis on a PerkinElmer/Sciex API III+ spectrometer yielded the expected

Spectra were acquired on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C in a buffer composed of boric, citric, and phosphoric acid, each at 7.5 mM. The pH was adjusted in the range of 1.2-8 by adding HCl or KOH, and the ionic strength was kept at 0.1 M by adding KCl. Spectra were recorded from 195 to 250 nm at 5 nm/min and 0.2-nm resolution and averaged over three scans. Temperatureinduced reversible denaturation was monitored by following the change in  at 222 nm. Data points were acquired at 20 s intervals with a bandwidth of 1 nm. The temperature was increased from 5 to 90 °C at 0.7 °C min-1. The sample was allowed to equilibrate for 20 min before heating and the reversibility of the denaturation was probed by monitoring  during cooling of the sample to the starting temperature. Assuming a two-state unfolding reaction (39), the observed obs is composed of

Marti et al. was acquired with various m set between 25 and 350 ms. For the latter two experiments, between 512 and 600 complex t1 points were collected in TPPI or States mode. Water suppression was accomplished with gradients via the watergate (46) or 3-9-19 (47) pulse sequences. t2 data were routinely acquired with 2 K complex points, and the carrier was positioned on the water frequency in both t1 and t2 using spectral widths of 8012.8 Hz (800 MHz) or 6009.6 Hz (600 MHz). Raw data were processed with the program FELIX v.98 (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) on a Silicon Graphics Indy R4400 workstation. t1 time domain data were zero filled to 2 K complex points. Resolution enhancement was achieved by applying straight (DQF-COSY) or 45°shifted squared (TOCSY, NOESY) sine-bell window functions along both t1 and t2 (48). Correction of the baseline was accomplished with a model-free algorithm (49). The matrix size of processed spectra was kept at 2 K × 2 K points. For a high-resolution spectrum of the DQF-COSY experiment (4 K × 4 K points), Gaussian multiplication of the t2 data was performed before Fourier transformation. 1H chemical shifts are referred to the TSP resonance using p-dioxane as an internal standard (50). pH Titration. The dependence of proton chemical shifts on the pH* was monitored by acquiring a total of 13 2D TOCSY experiments (70 ms of MLEV-17 mixing; 256 complex t1 points) at pH* values in the range 1.5-7. The AB zipper was dissolved in 700 µL of 90% H2O/10% D2O at a concentration of 2.44 mM, and spectra were recorded at 37 °C on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer as described above. The pH* in the sample was adjusted by adding small amounts of HCl or NaOH from stock solutions, after transferring the sample to an Eppendorf tube and temperature equilibration for 10 min at 37 °C. Off NMR tube pH* readings at 37 °C were repeated after transferring the sample back to the NMR tube once and after the acquisition of the NMR data. All three readings were consistent within 0.03 pH units. The pH* dependence of Glu H and backbone HN chemical shifts was analyzed according to refs 51 and 52:

obs(T) ) fU(T)[U(0) + mUT] + [1 - fU(T)][F(0) + mFT] (1)
U(0) and F(0) are the  values of the unfolded and folded protein, respectively, at the chosen reference temperature of 0 °C. mU and mF are the slopes of the linear temperature dependence of  of the unfolded and folded protein, respectively, and fU(T) is the fraction of unfolded protein. fU(T) relates to the Gibbs free energy of unfolding GU(T):

fU(T) ) exp[-GU(T)/RT]/{1 + exp[-GU(T)/RT]}

(2)

GU(T) is expressed by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation:

GU(T) ) HU(Tm)[1 - T/Tm] + Cp{T - Tm - Tln[T/Tm]} (3)
Tm is the transition midpoint temperature, HU(Tm) is the apparent transition enthalpy of unfolding at Tm, and Cp is the difference in the heat capacity between the folded and unfolded state. Cp was calculated according to refs 22 and 40 using the NMR structures and a linear, extended model peptide as templates. The calculated Cp was 0.5 kcal mol-1 K-1. U(0), mU, F(0), mF, HU(Tm), and Tm were fitted to the experimental CD data applying a nonlinear leastsquares fitting routine. Tm was verified by a minima search in the first derivative of eq 1. NMR Data Acquisition and Processing. The AB zipper was dissolved in 555 µL of 90% H2O/10% D2O (99.996 atom % D, Cambridge Isotope Lab., Andover, MA) at a concentration of 2.12 mM, and the pH* was adjusted to 5.65 by the addition of NaOD or DOAc. Data were recorded at 37 °C in quadrature on Bruker Avance DRX-800 and DRX600 spectrometers operating at 800 and 600 MHz, respectively, using 5-mm TXI triple resonance z-gradient probes. The DQF-COSY (41) experiment was acquired with 600 complex points along t1 applying Sates-TPPI (42), and water suppression was achieved with low-power irradiation during the 1 s relaxation delay between scans. The TOCSY experiment was recorded with the MLEV-17 (43), DIPSI-2 (44), or clean CITY (45) sequence for isotropic mixing (m of 35, 66, and 72 ms, respectively). The NOESY experiment

a and b are the chemical shift plateaus of proton resonances at the acidic and basic pH limits, respectively, and n is the Hill coefficient. Nonlinear least-squares fitting to eq 4 was performed with a, b, and pKa as free evolving parameters. n was either fixed at 1 or included as a free variable to probe for cooperativity. Interproton Distances, Stereospecific Assignment, and Torsion Angle Restraints. A total of 2492 NOE connectivities were unambiguously assigned in the 2D NOESY spectra. Distances3 were estimated from 1494 cross-peaks after measuring either volumes in the 150 ms NOESY experiment or the volume buildup in NOE experiments acquired with m of 25, 50, 75, and 100 ms. A total of 578 restraints were intraresidue, 318 were sequential, 418 were medium-range (1 < |i - j| < 5) and 180 were long-range (5 e |i - j|), the

Coiled Coil: NMR Structure and Glu pKa Values latter connecting protons across the chain interface. Fixed interproton separation of vicinal H and amide protons were used for the calibration of distances according to the r-6 relationship between NOE cross-peak volumes and distances. Upper limits were calculated by adding 30% of the estimated distance as well as the appropriate pseudo atom distance correction (53). Lower limits were set to 1.8 Å. HN-HR spin-spin coupling constants (3JHNR) were derived from the high-resolution DQF-COSY spectrum by spectral simulation of the cross-section along t2 of cross-peaks connecting HN to HR. 3JHNR e 5.5 Hz was identified for 52 residues for which torsion angles  were assigned to lie within -30° to -90° (54, 55). Stereospecific assignments of H were obtained for residues in a and d positions of the heptads on the basis of 3JR estimates from the DQF-COSY spectrum, and the HN-H and HR-H NOE intensities (m of 150 ms). 1 torsion angles of Asn16,16 were restrained to 180 ( 30° and -60 ( 30°, respectively, consistent with 3JR , and HN(i)-H (i), HN(i+1)-H (i) and HR(i)-H (i) NOE data. Stereospecific assignments of the Val -methyl groups were based on 3JR and on HN(i)-H(i), HN(i+1)-H(i) and HN(i)-H (i) NOE intensities. Structure Calculation. Computation of 50 structures was performed according to a distance geometry/simulated annealing protocol (56-58), using the program X-PLOR v.3.851 (59) and the "parallhdg5.0.pro" force field (60). After the embedding of backbone and / carbon atoms into a metric matrix on the basis of experimental constraints, unknown atom coordinates were least-squares fitted to the embedded coordinates with ideal covalent geometry. Chirality and planarity were introduced during 4.5 ps of high temperature MD at 1500 K. In the succeeding three runs of simulated annealing (6 ps each), vdW interactions were gradually increased while cooling stepwise from 1500, 1000, and 600 K, respectively, to 100 K. Regularized structures were Powell energy minimized in 200 steps. In the penultimate MD run, the distance between the S atoms of pairing Cys30/30 was constrained by a NOE. In the last MD run, the S's were covalently linked. Throughout the calculation, the NOE energy was modeled by a square-well function using the center averaging option for ambiguously assigned methylene and methyl protons. The vdW energy was represented by a repel function using a variable force constant. To avoid artifacts due to the simple repulsive potential for the nonbonded energy term, an 8-Å shell of explicit TIP3P model water and an electrostatic energy term were introduced in the further refinement (60, 61). MD simulations included heating to 500 K (1.25 ps), equilibration at 500 K (12.5 ps), and cooling to 100 K (5 ps). The energy of the final structures was Powell minimized in 200 steps. vdW and electrostatic energies were represented by switched and shifted functions, respectively, effective in the range from 6.5 to 8.5 Å. A soft-square function was used for modeling the NOE energy. The quality of the structures was assessed with the programs PROCHECK-NMR v.3.4.4 (62) and WHAT IF v.97 (63). Geometric properties were examined with the software MOLMOL v.2.6 (64) and with X-PLOR. The latter was also used for the computation of the solvent accessible surface using a solvent probe radius of 1.4 Å. Calculations were carried out on a Silicon Graphics Onyx2 workstation.

Cp was estimated from the difference in solvent-exposed surface area of the folded and linear, extended protein (40). Errors were estimated assuming an error in Cp of 0.5 kcal mol-1 K-1.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The sequence of the AB zipper and the location of the putative interhelical ionic bonds are shown in Figure 1. Net charges of the peptides at neutral pH are -8 (acidic chain) and +8 (basic chain). Localization of Val and Leu/Ala residues in positions a and d, respectively, and Asn in the a-position of the third heptad ensure parallel and in-register orientation of the chains in the dimer (4, 8, 10, 12, 16, 23). Positions b, c, and f are occupied by R-helix stabilizing residues, and Tyr in position b of the third heptad enables the determination of the peptide concentration from nearUV absorption (65). CD Spectroscopy. To investigate the pH dependence of the secondary structure content, CD spectra were recorded at pH values of 1.2, 1.9, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0, respectively, at an ionic strength of 0.1 M. Minima at 208 and 222 nm were observed in all spectra, evidence for R-helical structure being preserved within the investigated pH range. [222] varied from -34 410 deg cm2 dmol-1 at pH 1.2 to -31 990 deg cm2 dmol-1 at pH 8.0. These values are typical for proteins in almost fully R-helical conformation (21, 66, 67). The stability of the AB zipper was examined by temperature-induced denaturation experiments (Figure 2). Thermodynamic parameters calculated from thermal unfolding are given in Table 1. Two state folding/unfolding is supported by differential scanning calorimetry (data not shown). The AB zipper is most stable at pH 4.0. Stability decreases slightly at lower and higher pH values.

basis of 2D DQF-COSY and TOCSY experiments. The "fingerprint" area of the COSY spectrum is well-resolved comprising 62 cross-peaks connecting HN to HR (Figure 3, panel a). In contrast to what is observed for the homodimeric leucine zippers GCN4 (7) and c-Jun (11), resonances from residues located at identical positions in the two juxtaposed helices of the heterodimeric AB zipper differ in chemical shifts. Most of the residues display high-field shifted HR resonances, by comparison to the random coil conformation (68): this is evidence for helical structure in the AB zipper. HR resonances of most Ala and of residues located at the Nand C-terminal ends such as Glu1,1, Cys30,30, and Gly31,31 show moderate low-field shift changes. The sequential identification of the amino acids was obtained from the 2D NOESY spectra. Except for the N-terminal residues Glu1Gln3, which disclose similar HN chemical shifts, strong HN(i)HN(i+1) cross-peaks are observed between neighboring residues along both the acidic and the basic peptide chains (Figure 3, panel b, and Figure 4). Moreover, the presence of NOE cross-peaks of medium intensity connecting HR/ (i) to HN(i+1) is further evidence for the integrity of the sequential residue assignment. In helical secondary structure, short distances (<5 Å) are observed between protons HRHN(i+2,i+3,i+4), HN(i)-HN(i+2), and HR(i)-H (i+3) (69, 70). A large number of NOE cross-peaks connecting the corresponding protons have been identified in the AB zipper (Figure 4). The pattern of connectivities among backbone and side chain protons strongly suggests the occurrence of R-helical structure within the entire acidic and basic peptide chains, which is further supported by 3JHNR extracted from the DQF-COSY spectrum: 52 residues displayed 3JHNR < 5.5 Hz (Figure 4) suggesting backbone  torsion angles of  -60° typical for R-helical conformation. 3JHNR < 5.5 Hz is also compatible

with positive  values (55). Nevertheless, positive  are energetically unfavorable (69, 71) and have been rarely observed in protein structures. Resonance assignments of the AB zipper are provided as Supporting Information. AB Zipper Structure. Initially, 50 structures were calculated in a vacuum based on the experimental NMR restraints (Figure 5, panel a) without applying an energy term for electrostatic interactions. The ensemble of 50 calculated structures converged: heavy atom rmsd of 0.78 ( 0.27 Å (backbone) and 1.24 ( 0.27 Å (all atoms) for the peptide segments Val2-Glu29 and Val2-Lys29. Convergence was further improved by introducing an 8-Å shell of TIP3P model water molecules (61) and by applying a term for electrostatic interactions during the MD simulation in the last refinement step (60): heavy atom rmsd of 0.47 ( 0.13 Å (backbone) and 0.95 ( 0.16 Å (all atoms). Overall, the structures displayed a good covalent geometry and were in agreement with the experimental NMR restraints (Table 2). The quality of the backbone  and  angle conformation was probed with the program PROCHECK-NMR: 97.1% of the / angle pairs fell into the energetically most favored, 2.3% into the additional allowed, 0.3% into the generously allowed, and 0.3% into disallowed areas. A total of 25 structures were selected on the basis of their total energy, quality of the covalent geometry, and agreement with experimental restraints (Table 2). Both the acidic and the basic peptide chains are almost entirely in R-helical conformation and wrap around each other in parallel orientation (Figure 6, panel a). Residues displaying backbone rmsd < 0.5 Å are found within the four central heptads, namely, residue segments Ala3-Leu26 of the acidic and Leu5-Leu26 of the basic chain, while backbone atoms of residues located at the N- and C-terminal ends of

Intensities of NOE cross-peaks connecting HN(i) to HN(i+1,i+2,i+3), HR(i) to HN(i+1, i+2,i+3,i+4), H (i) to HN(i+1), and HR(i) to H (i+3) were determined in the 2D NOESY spectrum recorded with m of 150 ms. The widths of the bars represent the relative intensities of the NOE cross-peaks. The extent of HR chemical shift change (HR) relative to random coil HR shift (68) is illustrated by bars. The primary sequence of the acidic (left side) and basic (right side) chain is shown. Experimental conditions were as described in the legend of Figure 3.

the dimer are relatively disordered (Figure 5, panel b). The superhelical twist of the single chains is left-handed as observed in other coiled coils (8, 10, 12, 14). Overall, the AB zipper has a cylindrical shape with the approximate height of 41 Å and width of 18 Å. Best-fit alignment of the AB zippers' backbone heavy atoms of the four heptads

with the corresponding atoms of the GCN4 crystal structure yields an rmsd of 0.85 ( 0.14 Å. Hence, the overall fold of the designed heterodimeric AB zipper determined by NMR very closely matches the fold of natural nondisulfide-linked GCN4 obtained by X-ray crystallographic methods (8).

Force constants of 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2 and 200 kcal mol-1 rad-2 were applied for the calculation of NOE and CDIH energy terms.

Cys30/30 only marginally affects the integrity of the coiled coil structure. After best-fit superimposition of the GCN4 structure and the minimized average structure of the AB zipper, the averaged displacements of N, CR, and C atoms of a position residues of the four heptads amount to 0.57, 0.56, and 0.64 Å, respectively. For the corresponding atoms in Cys30/30, displacements of 0.64, 0.79, and 1.35 Å result. The relatively large displacement of C is a consequence of the lower structural definition of the C-terminal end of the zipper. The curvature of the juxtaposed helices is due to the CO(i), ,,HN(i+4) H-bond lengths being dependent on the position of the N-H bond vector in the heptad. HN groups of residues located at or close to the chain interface such as those of a, d, and e position residues are involved in shorter H-bonds than those of residues in positions b, c, f, or g pointing toward the solvent (8, 12, 73). The periodicity of the H-bond length is reflected in the HN chemical shifts. Less pronounced high field shifts are expected for HN resonances participating in the short H-bonds of the R-helix. The H-bond lengths in the AB zipper were predicted using an empirical function (74). In agreement with previously determined structures, short H-bond lengths4 result for residues in positions a, d, and e while significantly longer H-bond lengths are obtained for residues in positions b, c, f, and g (Figure 7, panel a). Alignment of Residues in Positions a and d. X-ray and NMR studies on coiled coils (5, 8, 10, 12, 14) have shown that side chains of interface residues pack according to

Crick's "knobs-into-holes" model (1). In this model, residue a of one peptide chain is surrounded by residues a, d, d(-1), and g(-1) forming a "hole" in the adjacent helix. Likewise, residue in position d of one helix forms a "knob" which is in close contact with residues a, d, e, and a(+1) of the adjacent chain. A total of 177 of the 180 NMR-derived interchain distances5 represent such interactions across the dimer interface. The spatial orientation of the CR-C bond is determined by the backbone conformation of the protein. Because of the R-helical conformation of the two chains in the AB zipper and their relative orientation in the dimer, the CR-C bond of residues in positions a packs in parallel orientation relative to the vector defined by CR atoms of residues in positions a and g(-1) on the juxtaposed strand. Residues in position d pack in such a way that the CR-C bond is aligned perpendicularly relative to the vector formed by CR atoms of residues in positions d and e. Such alignment of residues at the chain interface is in line with the "knobs-into-holes" packing model (17) and is typically found in coiled coils (8, 10, 12). The averaged 1 angle for all six Val residues in the set of 25 selected structures is 173.4 ( 7.6°, which matches the energetically preferred 1 rotamer of 180°. Corresponding Val's in the crystal structure of GCN4 and in c-Jun have an averaged 1 of 177° (8, 10). The six Leu residues of the AB zipper in position d exhibit 1 ) -64.0 ( 8.7° and 2 ) 173.2 ( 9.3°, in good agreement with the preferred rotamers of Leu ( 1 and 2 of -60° and 180°, respectively) and with Leu rotamers in other coiled coils (8, 10, 12).
5 Twenty-four NOEs are observed between a and a, 14 between d and d, 17 between a and d, 23 between a and d(-1), 42 between a and g(-1), and 57 between d and e position residues. One pertains to d-c and two pertain to b-d(-1) interactions.

Side chain bonds of acidic and basic residues are displayed in red and blue, respectively, and backbone bonds are outlined in green. (b) Representation of the minimized average structure obtained from the set of 25 selected structures. Atoms of charged residues and of amino acids in positions a and d are drawn in vdW space filling mode. Acidic and basic residues are colored in red and blue, respectively, and a color code of green and yellow is applied for residues in positions a and d. Side chain and backbone bonds are displayed in stick and ribbon representation, respectively. Front and back views of the zipper are shown. The figures were created with the program MOLMOL v.2.6 (64).

In the AB zipper, proton frequencies of Asn16,16 are distinguishable, indicating substantial structural asymmetry in the peptide segment. DQF-COSY spectra reveal strong 3J 16 3 of the acidic and Asn16 R couplings involving Asn H 2 of the basic chain, while 3J H R couplings to the corresponding vicinal H are only weak. NOE cross-peak intensity ratios of the connectivities between HN-H 2 and HN-H 3 amount to 1.12 for Asn16 and 1.66 for Asn16, while those between HN(i+1)-H 2(i) and HN(i+1)-H 3(i) yield intensity ratio values of 0.55 (Asn16) and 1.12 (Asn16), respectively. Such pattern of scalar and dipolar couplings suggest that Asn16,16 of the acidic and basic chain adopt 1 rotamer conformations of 180° and -60°, respectively. By comparison, the crystal structure of GCN4 exhibits 1 of -68.2° and -174.7° (8).

Interestingly, NMR studies on the GCN4 (7) and c-Jun homodimers (10, 16) reveal only one set of resonances for the conserved Asn consistent either with a symmetrical packing of Asn in solution or with a fast exchange between asymmetrical conformations that cannot be resolved on the NMR time scale at RT (16, 75). Alignment of Charged Residues in Positions e and g. Charged residues in the heptad positions e and g can modulate the stability of the coiled coils as well as the specificity of dimerization (27, 28, 34). Thus, folding of a dimeric zipper containing exclusively Glu in each e and g position on both chains is prevented above pH 6 due to interhelical charge repulsion (21, 22, 27). Moreover, the preference of c-Jun-Fos and the c-Myc-Max for heterodimer

FIGURE 7: Predicted H-bond length between CO(i) and NH(i+4) groups and relative solvent accessibilities of side chains in the AB zipper. (a) The H-bond length was calculated on the basis of the HN chemical shift according to an empirical function (74) and averaged for each heptad position in the acidic (solid line) and basic (dashed line) helix, respectively. H-bonds within the four central heptad pairs in the zipper were considered for the averaging. (b) The relative solvent accessibilities of side chains in the acidic (white bars) and basic (black bars) helices are plotted versus the heptad position. Solvent accessibilities determined for side chains in a linear peptide using three Gly as spacer between different residue types served as the 100% reference. Data represent the averaged accessibilities derived for the ensemble of 25 selected structures.

formation results from attractive (heterodimer) and repulsive (homodimer) electrostatic interactions of ionic residues in g and e(+1) positions (25, 76). In the designed AB zipper, all e and g positions are occupied by Glu in the acidic, and by Lys or Arg in the basic chain. All together, seven attractive and one repulsive interhelical electrostatic interactions are possible: E1(g0)-K6(e1), E1(g0)-E6(e1), E8(g1)K13(e2), R8(g1)-E13(e2), E15(g2)-K20(e3), R15(g2)E20(e3), E22(g3)-R27(e4), K22(g3)-E27(e4). Between 10 and 44 NOE-derived interresidue distance constraints per amino acid were applied in the structure calculations to determine the spatial alignment of the charged residues (Figure 5, panel a). In general, the rmsd values of the residues correlate with the number of unambiguously assigned NOE constraints. The conformations of Glu, Lys, and Arg side chains in the set of 25 selected structures are depicted in Figure 6, panel a. Inspection of the side chain NOEs of the charged residues reveals the preferred partners for interresidue interactions (Table 3). Residues in g position of heptad i are prone to be close to residues in positions d and f of the same heptad as well as with residues a and d of heptad i + 1. Furthermore, a significant number of interactions with residue a in heptad i + 1 of the juxtaposed helix is observed. In contrast, e position residues interact mainly with residues

in positions a, b, d, and f of the same heptad, while no distance constraints to residues of the consecutive heptad have been found. In addition, all e position residues show a large number of interactions to residue d of heptad i located on the opposite helix. Such pattern of NOE-derived distances imposes a defined alignment of the residues' side chains across the chain interface (Figure 6). Indeed, residues in g and e(+1) positions point against each other in such a way that partial H-bonding occurs in the calculated structures. An exception is Lys6, for which no H-bond interaction to Glu1 is observed due to the low structural definition of the N-terminal residue. Likewise, no H-bond partners are detected for the side chains of Glu29 and Lys29 located close to the C-terminal ends. Comparison of the averaged structure of the ensemble calculated in a vacuum, without applying an electrostatic function, with the averaged structure of the ensemble derived in the presence of a water shell reveals a very similar orientation of the charged side chains. Hence, the alignment of the charged residues results from the applied distance restraints and is not just a consequence of switching on the electrostatic term in the last refinement step. Inspection of NOESY spectra recorded with long m reveals no unambiguous NOE cross-peaks connecting side chain protons of the suggested ion pairs. The lack of NOEs between the charged residues, although the average distance between Glu H and Lys/Arg H is 4.82 ( 0.51 Å in the structures, hints at a large mobility of the charged side chains leading to cancellation of the dipolar couplings. Since no distance restrains between charged g and e(+1) position residues were applied in the structure calculation, the spatial alignment of those residues is exclusively imposed by intrahelical restraints as well as restraints to a(+1) or d position residues of the juxtaposed chain (Table 3). The latter interactions are consistent with the "knobs-into-holes" packing of helices (1) in which close contacts between a(+1)-g and d-e residues are formed. The interactions with hydrophobic a and d position residues of the helix-interface imply that e and g position residues contribute to the hydrophobic core of the coiled coil (Figure 8). The alignment of the acidic and basic residues across the hydrophobic chain interface is apparently a consequence of both ionic interactions among side chain

Their alignment across the chain interface helps to shield interface residues a and d from solvent. Determination of pKa Values of Glu -Carboxylate Groups. The chemical shift of Glu H resonances depends on the protonation state of the side chains' carboxylate group (78) and can be used to determine pKa values. The chemical shift change of Glu H has been followed in 2D TOCSY experiments recorded between pH 7 and 1.5 at very low ionic strength where variation of pKa's are more pronounced because of lack of salt screening. Cross-peaks connecting HN to H2,3 provided unique H chemical shifts since only minor peak overlap occurred within the investigated pH range. All Glu H showed sufficiently large chemical shift changes to keep chemical shift reading errors low (Figure 9). Fitting of the experimental data to eq 4 was performed with either a constant Hill coefficient of n ) 1 or with n as a free parameter (Table 4). In general, pKa's thus fitted are comparable. The largest difference in pKa (0.09 units) is observed for Glu6 H for which n is 0.75. For the remaining Glu H resonances, the fitted n varied between 0.84 ( 0.07. n smaller than 1 implies negative cooperativity, which may be caused by nearby groups titrating with a similar ionization constant; n e 1 is seen frequently in NMR pH titration experiments (37, 52, 79). Glu1,1 in the less structured N-terminal tails have pKa values of 4.14 ( 0.02 and 4.22 ( 0.02, respectively. These pKa's closely resemble those of Glu located in short model peptides at 35 °C (80), in unfolded peptide segments of GCN4 at 25 °C (36) or in the N-terminal tail of matrilin-1 at 50 °C (37), the latter two measured at an ionic strength of 0.15 M. In comparison, the pKa of AcGluOMe is between 4.3 and 4.4 (36, 37, 81). In case of the Glu's located within the coiled coil proper of the AB zipper, plotting of the pKa versus the sequence number results in a V-shaped curve (Figure 10, panel a). In comparison with model compound Glu, residues positioned close to the ends of the structured coiled coil, in particular Glu6 and Glu22, have relatively high pKa's (4.82). Glu residues in the Glu8-Glu20 peptide segment reveal moderately shifted pKa's (4.11-4.52), Glu15, located in the center of the sequence, having the lowest pKa (4.11). Sigmoidal pH dependence of the chemical shift, suggesting vicinity to a titratable group, is observed for 19 HN resonances of the acidic chain. Plotting of the pKa versus the sequence number results in a curve that follows a similar trend as seen for the pKa obtained from Glu H chemical shift data (Figure 10, panel a). It appears therefore that the chemical shift of backbone HN is largely affected by the ionization state of Glu close in sequence. 12 HN resonances of the basic helix shift sigmoidally with respect to pH, and the fitted pKa reflect the ionization behavior of Glu located nearby (data not shown). The total chemical shift change  of backbone HN, on going from pH 7.0 to pH 1.5 is illustrated in Figure 10, panels b and c. In case of the acidic helix, many Glu residues and some of their immediate neighbors display negative (HN). Hence, closeness of these HN to Glu COO- is likely. The low-field shift at neutral pH is due to deshielding of HN upon interaction with the charged Glu carboxylate group. In the basic helix, low-field shifts upon raising of the pH are observed for residues

Marti et al. opposing Glu on the juxtaposed chain. In general, |()| is smaller than 0.15 ppm indicative of only weak interaction with the corresponding Glu side chains. The largest negative () is observed for Gln3, which is involved in partial H-bonding with the -carboxylate group of Glu1 in the calculated structures. Contribution of Charged Glu to Stability of the Coiled Coil. The difference in the pKa of an ionizable residue measured in the folded and unfolded protein reflects the difference in the contribution to protein stability of the residue in charged and uncharged form, respectively (32, 35, 36). The influence of the protonation state of a particular Glu residue on the free energy of folding is defined as

GF ) GF,- - GF,0

(5)

where GF,- refers to the charged form and GF,0 refers to the uncharged form of the residue. GF can be expressed as

GF ) -2.303RT(pKU - pKF) a a

(6)

where superscripts U and F refer to the unfolded and folded protein, respectively. If pKF > pKU, GF is positive: the a a protonated, uncharged form of the acidic group is more stabilizing. f pKF < pKU, GF is negative: the deprotoa a nated, charged form of the acidic group is more stabilizing. Hence, if a charged residue is contributing favorably to GF by forming a stable salt bridge, one expects a lower pKa in the folded than in the unfolded protein. To calculate GF, one has to know the pKa values in the unfolded protein, which may be deduced from protein fragments containing the acidic residues of interest. However, protein fragments are not a complete representation of the denatured state and both local and nonlocal sequence effects may perturb the pKa's. Also, pKa's of the unfolded state when deduced from protein fragments often vary depending on the chosen size of the fragments (82). As an alternative, the pKa value of model compound AcGluOMe, which is 4.3-4.4 (36, 37, 81), may serve as reference. Because of desolvation effects and electrostatic interactions with other charged groups and permanent dipoles, the pKa value decreases when placing the residue in an unstructured peptide chain (35): a pKa value of 4.2 was identified for Glu located in the tetrapeptide G-G-E-A (80). Values of similar magnitude were obtained for Glu in unfolded peptide segments of coiled coils (36, 37) or for Glu1,1 positioned at the less structured N-terminus of the AB zipper in this study. Assuming that the pKa's in the unfolded protein equal 4.4 of model compound AcGluOMe, the sum of the GF's amounts to 0.98 kcal mol-1. Assuming pKa ) 4.2 in the unfolded peptide, the sum of the GF's is 3.82 kcal mol-1. Hence, independent of the reference pKa applied, the net contribution of the charged Glu side chains is destabilizing. Heat denaturation experiments monitored by CD disclose a change of GF () -GU) of 1.6 kcal mol-1 when increasing the pH from 4 to 8 (Table 1). This value is similar to the summed GF's assuming pKa ) 4.4 in the unfolded protein. The contribution of the 10 Glu residues to the net charge of the AB zipper is -10 and -2.7 at pH 8 and 4, respectively. A substantial decrease in GF is already observed when changing the pH from 8 to 6 (-0.5 kcal mol-1, Table 1), even though the net

charge contribution of Glu at pH 6 is still -9.7. This observation points at additional factors, besides the charge of Glu, affecting the stability of the coiled coil such as the dependence of the helical propensity and hydrophobicity of residues on pH. To summarize, pKa data suggest that the majority of the charged Glu residues of the AB zipper contribute unfavorably to the stability of the coiled coil. In particular, Glu's in positions 6, 8, 22, 27, and 29 display significantly upward shifted pKa's and seem to be a source for the lower stability of the zipper at neutral pH. Charged Glu's located at the N-terminus and near the center of the peptide play only a marginal role in stabilizing or destabilizing the protein as indicated by their pKa values being similar to reference values for Glu's in unfolded peptides. In case of Glu1,1, higher pKa values might be expected due to mutual charge repulsion. However, Glu's near the N-terminus of the helix "feel" the helix dipole, which may lower the pKa. In general, results are in line with studies on the contribution of Glu20 and Glu22 to the stability of GCN4 (36), both residues being involved in salt bridges with Lys15 and Lys27, respectively, in the X-ray structure (8). pKa values of 4.44 and 4.13 have been determined for the folded form suggesting unfavorable and negligible contribution of the charged Glu to stability. Interestingly, Glu20 in both GCN4 and the AB zipper display very similar protonation constants (4.44 and 4.41, respectively) indicative of being slightly destabilizing in charged form. In contrast to Glu22 in GCN4, the corresponding residue of the AB zipper has a higher pKa (4.82). Glu22 of GCN4 is able to form ion pairs with Lys27 and Arg25, the latter located on the same helix, whereas Glu22

of the AB zipper has no opportunity for intrahelical ion pairing. pKa values of the AB zipper are also comparable to the pKa's of the eight Glu residues in homotrimeric matrilin1: a destabilizing role was reported for two of the Glu's, while only marginal effects on the stability were encountered for the remaining Glu's (37). In all the studies on pKa values of Glu in coiled coils published thus far, including the present work, the contribution of charged Glu to stability is either unfavorable, negligible, or at best slightly favorable. The question of whether electrostatic interhelix interactions do occur at all in coiled coils remains to be discussed now. NOE connectivities of the AB zipper reveal a distinct pattern of interresidue contacts involving g and e position residues (Table 3). Such contacts, in particular those with a and d position residues of the juxtaposed helix emphasize the relatively defined spatial alignment of these side chains. As shown in Figure 6, panel a, the conformation of side chains is flexible. Yet each ensemble of side chains points into the same specific direction leading to partial electrostatic interactions between g and e(+1) position residues as well as hydrophobic interactions with the chain interface. In a study about stability of engineered salt bridges in T4 lysozyme, it was concluded that ionic interactions among charged residues located on the protein surface are not favorable since the electrostatic energy term is outweighed by a large unfavorable entropic term for fixing the residues in a specific conformation (83). In the AB zipper, the charged side chains show some conformational variability (Figure 6, panel a), which may keep unfavorable entropic contribution low. The fact of the zipper being more stable at acidic pH suggests

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 42, 2000 12817 hydrophobic, or entropic contributions to stability. In addition, the pKa value is affected by electrostatic interactions with other charged groups in the molecule. Hence, the favorable energy of the Glu22-Arg27 interaction might be outweighed by unfavorable electrostatic interactions with other negatively charged groups shifting the pKa upward. Indeed, electrostatic calculations (63, 84, 85) on the minimized average structure of the AB zipper predict high pKa's for Glu6 and Glu22 despite an ionic bond of the latter to Arg27. Likewise, favorable hydrophobic interactions of an uncharged Glu might increase its pKa. With the aim at decomposition of GF into the individual energetic terms, we are presently performing extensive calorimetric experiments on the AB zipper as well as continuum electrostatic calculations based on the NMR solution structures presented here.

that the driving force for the alignment of the residues is of hydrophobic rather than of electrostatic nature. Higher stability at low pH has also been reported by Zhou et al. (27, 33) for a designed homodimeric coiled coil with 10 potential g/e(+1) ion pairs. Double mutant cycle analysis yielded contributions to stability of -0.37 kcal mol-1 for the interhelical ion pairs involving charged Glu, and of -0.65 kcal mol-1 for the protonated form of Glu. Hence, although the energetic term of the ionic interaction may seem favorable at neutral pH, it is offset by an even more favorable energetic term gained from a uncharged Glu at low pH. Uncharged Glu is characterized by higher helical preference as well as higher hydrophobicity allowing a better packing of the side chain against apolar residues located at the chain interface (22). In the NMR structures of the AB zipper, Glu22 in particular seems to form an interhelical salt bridge with Arg27 yet this Glu displays a high pKa value. This, however, is no contradiction since GF, though apparently unfavorable, does not reveal single energy terms, such as the electrostatic,
