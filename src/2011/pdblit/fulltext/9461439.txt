Structure of the Amino-Terminal Protein Interaction Domain of STAT-4
Uwe Vinkemeier, Ismail Moarefi,* James E. Darnell Jr., John Kuriyan
STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription) are a family of transcription factors that are specifically activated to regulate gene transcription when cells encounter cytokines and growth factors. The crystal structure of an NH2-terminal conserved domain (N-domain) comprising the first 123 residues of STAT-4 was determined at 1.45 angstroms. The domain consists of eight helices that are assembled into a hook-like structure. The N-domain has been implicated in several protein-protein interactions affecting transcription, and it enables dimerized STAT molecules to polymerize and to bind DNA cooperatively. The structure shows that N-domains can interact through an extensive interface formed by polar interactions across one face of the hook. Mutagenesis of an invariant tryptophan residue at the heart of this interface abolished cooperative DNA binding by the full-length protein in vitro and reduced the transcriptional response after cytokine stimulation in vivo.

The STATs constitute a family of transcription factors that are necessary for the activation of distinct sets of target genes in response to cytokines and growth factors (1). The STAT proteins are activated in the cytoplasm by phosphorylation on a single tyrosine residue (2). Each STAT molecule contains an SH2 domain, and reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions between two STAT molecules result in the formation of active dimers that translocate to the nucleus and activate gene expression (Fig. 1A) (2). The canonical recognition site for a STAT dimer encompasses 9 to 10 base pairs (TTCN3­ 4 GAA) of DNA (3). However, analysis of the binding of activated STATs to DNA targets revealed that the STAT binding sites can extend over two or more adjacent canonical sites (4, 5). Mammalian transcription factors activate transcription and achieve biological specificity through interactions with other transcription factors, trans-activators, or the general transcription machinery (6). Although the molecular basis for these phenomena is poorly understood, direct protein-protein interactions among multiple promoter-bound proteins appear to mediate this synergistic activation (7). In the case of the STATs, a small NH2terminal domain mediates a number of

2.1 gene revealed the necessity for cooperative STAT binding to two adjacent recognition sites for a full growth hormone response (10). These cooperative contacts also affect the binding site selection of different STATs on a natural promoter that contains multiple potential STAT recognition sites (4). Deletion of the NH2-terminal 100 residues of STAT-1 or STAT-4 abolishes cooperative binding to DNA (4, 9). The truncated protein fully retains binding to a single target site as a dimer, suggesting that the N-domain is dispensable for dimer formation and DNA binding (9), but is necessary for interaction between STAT dimers and binding site discrimination (4). The Ndomain of STAT-1 is also required for interaction between STAT-1 and the transcriptional coactivator protein CBP, a large ( 2500 amino acids) polypeptide with transacetylase activity (11). Additionally, the amino-terminal region of STAT-2 is involved in binding to the intracellular region of the interferon- receptor (12). The NH2-terminal 131 residues of STAT-1 form a stable domain that is readily cleaved off the intact molecule, indicating that it is an independently folded mod-

ule (9). Sequence alignments show that the N-domain is highly conserved (Fig. 1B). The average sequence identity for this region between mammalian STAT proteins is 40%, and ranges from 51% between STAT-1 and STAT-4 to 20% between STAT-5 and STAT-6. Over the 750 amino acids that span the length of the common core of the STATs, only the SH2 domain is more highly conserved (13). The N-domain is also found in the Drosophila STAT (dStat92E) (Fig. 1B) (14) and in a recently discovered STAT in Dictyostelium discoideum (15). The first gene defect established in the DStat92E gene is a misspliced variant that produces both normal mRNA and an mRNA encoding only the NH2terminal 41 residues. Expression of this fragment has a partial dominant negative effect on transcriptional activation by the wildtype protein in cell culture and in the fly is associated with a weak abnormal phenotype (16). We solved the crystal structure of the N-domain of STAT-4 (17) by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction and have refined an atomic model to a resolution of 1.45 Å (R 19.4%, Rfree 22.3%) (Table 1). The STAT-4 N-domain is all helical, with an unusual architecture. Instead of the up-down connectivity of helix bundles or the box-like helical packing of the globin fold, the N-domain is constructed from three distinct structural elements that pack together. The NH2-terminal 40 residues encompass the first four helices ( 1 to 4), which form a ring-shaped element (colored red in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3B). A small helix ( 5) connects this ring to the next structural element, an antiparallel coiled-coil formed by helices 6 and 7. The heptad repeat of hydrophobic amino acids, characteristic of coiled-coils, is conserved across the STATs (Fig. 1B). Finally, the distal surface of the ringshaped element forms a docking site for the last helix in the structure ( 8). The overall appearance of the structure is that of a hook, with the inner surface of the hook being formed by the intersection of the proximal surfaces of the ring-shaped element and the coiled-coil. The N-domain of STAT-4 is dimeric in solution (18), and a twofold symmetry axis in the crystal generates a dimer with an extensive polar interface that involves one face of the hook. The N-domain has a well-defined hydrophobic core that is conserved across the STATs, consistent with a stable and defined fold (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2). However, the NH2-terminal ring-shaped element is stabilized by polar interactions involving buried charges. The ring is closed off by helix-dipole interaction between the NH2-terminal region of helix 1 and the carboxylate group of Glu39, presented by the COOH-terminal region of helix 4 (Fig. 2B). Glu39 forms a hydrogen bond with the amide nitrogen of residue Gln3 and is oriented correctly for this charge dipole interaction by the side chain of Arg31, which in turn forms a buried ion pair with Glu112. Glu112 is positioned by interactions with Tyr22 and a buried water molecule. Each of the side chains involved is invariant in all STATs (Fig. 1B), indicating that the ringshaped element is conserved in architecture. A consequence of the use of these polar groups in the ring-shaped element is the formation of a compact and potentially specific interaction surface. This structural element forms a relatively flat molecular surface that packs at an angle against another surface presented by the coiled-coil formed by helices 6 and 7. The juxtaA

posing of the surface of the ring-shaped element with that of the coiled-coil results in a wedge-shaped groove. This groove is lined with hydrophobic residues, with polar residues at the center, and appears as though it could be a site of interaction with other proteins. A possible function for this groove is suggested by the fact that replacement of Arg31 or Glu39 in STAT-1 by Ala results in a molecule that is more slowly dephosphorylated after interferoninduction than the wild-type protein (19). Thus, a phosphatase that controls STAT dephosphorylation might bind to the groove in the N-domain. There is one molecule in the asymmetric unit of the STAT-4 crystal, and it is related to another by a twofold symmetry axis (Fig. 2A and Fig. 3A). There is an extensive interface between the two monomers of the dimer that buries 1714 Å2 of surface area (Fig. 3A). An extended intermolecular hydrogen bonding network is formed at the interface that includes 15 amino-acid side chains and 12 water molecules per monomer (Fig. 3B). In addition, five backbone contacts are also observed in each monomer. Eleven of the 15 residues at the interface make direct hydrogen-bonding contacts to the other monomer. The water molecules at the interface are very well defined in the electron density map, and many of them have low temperature factors ( 10 Å2) (Fig. 3C). The interface between N-domain monomers is almost entirely polar. In contrast to the leucine zipper, wherein hydrophobic residues are used to generate the intermolecular interface by the formation of a coiled-coil across the dimer interface (20), the coiled-coil in the N-domain is firmly anchored within the domain and its role is to serve as an architectural support

for the presentation of a number of interacting side chains at the interface between N-domains and at the potential interaction groove. Whereas hydrophobic interactions are associated with stabilization of folded protein structures and are often found at the core of tight interfaces, polar interactions can provide both stability and specificity in protein-protein interactions (21). In contrast to the residues that constitute the buried core of the N-domain, which are conserved across STATs, the majority of the residues at the dimer interface are not conserved (Fig. 1B and Fig. 3B). This variation may provide specificity in STAT dimer-dimer interactions on DNA. Only two of the residues at the interface are invariant in all STATs: Trp37, a central anchor residue at the interface, and Glu39, which also participates in the formation of the ring-shaped element. To test the physiological relevance of the dimer of N-domains that is observed in the crystal structure, we determined whether mutation of the critical residue Trp37 to Ala37 (W37A) at the interface would disrupt or reduce oligomerization in vitro and transcriptional activation in vivo. These experiments were done with STAT-1 (22). Because of the close similarity between the N-domains of STAT-1 and STAT-4 (51% amino acid identity) we expect structural information derived from the STAT-4 crystal structure to represent the STAT-1 architecture as well. We used an oligonucleotide bearing tandem binding sites that binds two STAT-1 dimers. This site contains two weak binding sites, spaced 10 base pairs apart (23). Competition experiments show that the off time is long for wild-type STAT-1 (greater than 15 to 30 min), indicating the formation of a stable tetrameric complex. In contrast, if an oligonucleotide containing only a single weak site is used instead, the off-time is very short ( 30 s) (9). The stabilization of STAT-1 on oligonucleotides containing tandem binding sites is not observed if the N-domain is deleted (9). The W37A mutant protein bound to the DNA probe with tandem sites as a dimer, but the tetrameric interaction was completely displaced by the addition of unlabeled oligonucleotides (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the wild-type protein was resistant to displacement for more than 15 min. We used the same two tandem weak binding sites to drive transcription from a reporter gene in an interferon-dependent transcriptional assay (24) using U3A cells, which lack endogenous STAT-1 (25).

Shown are two monomers of a dimer with the left one rotated 90° around the vertical axis away from the original position in the dimer. Note the hook-like appearance of the monomer with the coiled-coil of helices 6 and 7 pointing out of the planar surface formed by the ring-shaped element comprising the NH2-terminal 40 residues. Residues from three separate regions of the N-domain make direct or water-mediated contacts in the dimer and are color-coded according to their position. Interface residues at the NH2-terminus are in green, those in helices 3 and 4 are in blue, and amino acids located in helix 6 are yellow. The position of the critical W37 is highlighted in red. The figure was created using GRASP (29). (B) A view at the dimerization interface with amino acids represented as ball-and-stick models and the c backbone as a ribbon. The monomer is in the same orientation as the one on the right side of (A). Side chains are colored as in (A); the backbone ribbon is colored as in Fig. 2B, with the first 40 residues highlighted in red.

mains or whether the conformation of the STAT molecule in the absence of DNA impedes further oligomerization. In any case, the presentation of highly polar and unique interaction surfaces by the N-domains of the STATs provides a ready means for generating very specific interactions between adjacent STAT dimers on DNA, because the hydrogen bonding constraints of the interacting groups place stereochemical constraints on potential partners. Whereas each N-domain dimer is closed, the fact that each STAT dimer presents two N-domains for interaction makes possible the generation of openended STAT-STAT interactions that are limited only by the nature and number of the adjacent DNA binding sites.

The STAT-4 N-domain was expressed as a COOHterminal fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST ). The expression vector was constructed by amplification in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Vent DNA-polymerase, New England Biolabs) of the appropriate region of mouse STAT-4 cDNA and cloning of the fragment into the Bam HI and Eco RI sites of pGEX2T (Pharmacia). Sequence comparison with the STAT-1 N-domain led us to terminate the similar domain in STAT-4 after residue 124. Three glycine residues were included after the thrombin cleavage site [K.-L. Guan and J. E. Dixon, Anal. Biochem. 192, 262 (1991)]. The resulting protein has four additional NH2-terminal amino acids and Met1 of STAT-4 is replaced with Gly. The construct was verified by dideoxy sequencing. BL21p(lysS) cells were grown and lysed as described (9). Soluble protein was combined with 0.2 volumes of a 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Pharmacia) and mixed for 5 min. The bound protein was washed with cleavage buffer [50 mM Hepes HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DT T )]. Cleavage of the GST fusion protein with thrombin ( 1 U per milligram of substrate; Novagen) was done overnight at room temperature. Eluted STAT-4 N-domain (in cleavage buffer) was concentrated to 20 mg/ml with centricon (Amicon) and used for crystallization. 18. The polymerization status was determined by dynamic light scattering at a protein concentration of

Table 1. Crystallographic analysis. The STAT-1 N-domain formed only small, needle-like crystals. However, hanging drops (1 l) of STAT-4 N-domain were mixed with equal volumes of reservoir buffer containing 0.2 M Na CH3COO , 0.1 M tris HCl (pH 8.0), 17% PEG4000, and hexagonal crystals (0.2 mm by 0.2 mm by 0.2 mm) were routinely grown overnight at 20°C. The crystals contain one molecule of the STAT-4 NH2-terminal domain in the asymmetric unit and are in space group P6522 (a 79.51 Å, b 79.51 Å, c 84.68 Å). Crystals were cryoprotected in reservoir solution enriched in PEG to 20% and glycerol to 22.5% before flash-freezing. Heavy-atom derivatives were prepared by soaking crystals for 30 min in a 1: 20 diluted (with cryoprotective solution) saturated solution of p-hydroxy-mercuribenzoic acid (PHMB). Data for the native crystal were collected at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) at beam-line X25, using a Mar imaging-plate detector system (Mar, Norderstadt, Germany). A multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) experiment on a PHMB-derivatized crystal was performed at BNL on beam-line X4A, using Fuji imaging plates. Data processing and reduction were done with HKL, DENZO, and SCALEPACK ( Z. Otwinowski and W. Minor). Model building was performed with O (30). Bulk solvent correction and anisotropic B-factor scaling was applied during refinement, using X-PLOR (31). Of the five heterologous residues at the NH2-terminus, the first three residues (GSG), as well as the COOH-terminal residue Q124, are not visible in the electron density map.

Uncoupling of Immune Complex Formation and Kidney Damage in Autoimmune Glomerulonephritis
Raphael Clynes, Calin Dumitru, Jeffrey V. Ravetch*
The generation of autoantibody and subsequent tissue deposition of immune complexes (IC) is thought to trigger the pathogenic consequences of systemic autoimmune disease. Modulation of the autoantibody response disrupts pathogenesis by preventing the formation of ICs; however, uncoupling IC formation from subsequent inflammatory responses seems unlikely because of the apparent complexity of the IC-triggered inflammatory cascade. However, the disruption of a single gene, which encodes the chain of the Fc receptor, was found to achieve this uncoupling in a spontaneous model of lupus nephritis, the New Zealand Black/New Zealand White (NZB/NZW ) mouse. Gamma chain­deficient NZB/NZW mice generated and deposited IC and activated complement, but were protected from severe nephritis, thus defining another potential pathway for therapeutic intervention in autoimmune disease.

NZB mice develop autoantibodies and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, but show no signs of glomerular disease until crossed to the NZW background to generate NZB/ NZW (B/W F1) mice (1). A minimum of three distinct genetic loci are required for the manifestation of autoimmune glomerulonephritis in the B/W F1, two derived from NZB and one from NZW mice (2, 3). Several features of this model are consistent with lupus in humans. Females develop disease at a frequency 10 times that of males, and IC and complement deposition in glomeruli are observed.

is seen concomitant with the serological appearance of antibodies to DNA as well as ICs of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), IgG2a, and IgG2b subclasses beginning at 4 months (1). Median survival is 6 months, with mortality resulting from renal failure. Several studies have demonstrated the essential role of B cells (4) and autoantibodies (5, 6) in disease development. Agents that interfere with autoantibody production have been shown to attenuate disease (7­ 12). Disruption of the subsequent inflammatory response triggered by glomerular IC deposition represents an alternative therapeutic approach, but success may be complicated by the large number of possible proinflammatory molecules presumed to be activated by ICs, including complement components and the cellular receptors for

IgG. Complement depletion attenuates disease in several induced models of glomerulonephritis (13, 14), and anti-C5a treatment modulates glomerular injury in a spontaneous murine model (15). However, the primacy of complement activation in IC-triggered inflammation has been questioned by several recent genetic studies (16­20). In the classical model of IC-triggered inflammation, the Arthus reaction, the demonstration that Fc Rs are essential whereas complement is not (16­20) suggests that the fundamental assumption of the pathogenesis of autoimmune glomerulonephritis as being mediated by complement activation (13, 21­27) requires reevaluation. Such studies have been facilitated by the availability of defined murine strains deficient in components of this pathway. Mouse strain / , which is deficient in the Fc receptor (FcR) chain, does not express the activation receptors Fc RI and Fc RIII, but still bears the inhibitory receptor Fc RIIB. To determine if the spontaneous autoimmune glomerulonephritis in the B/W F1 required Fc Rs for disease development, NZB and NZW mice were backcrossed for eight generations to the / mouse strain, and animals homozygous or heterozygous for the disruption in the / chain were identified. We obtained / and B/W F1 animals and observed them for evidence of autoimmune glomerulonephritis. As reported (1), B/W F1 animals have a median survival of 200 days, succumbing to the sequelae of renal failure (Fig. 1A). In contrast, / B/W mice had a prolonged survival, with 82% (20 of 22) alive at 9 months. In B/W mice, the appearance of proteinuria presages the onset of

Tyrosine phosphorylated human wild-type STAT-1 was produced as described (9). Mutated STAT-1 ( W37A) was expressed from pAcSG2 in baculovirus-infected insect cells. PCR was used to exchange codon 37 [ TGG ] with [GCA] in the Nco I/Spe I fragment of human STAT-1 cDNA. Additionally, a 6-His tag was added to the COOH-terminus. Modifications were confirmed by sequencing. Insect cells were lysed (dounce homogenizer), and mutated STAT-1 was purified under native conditions on Ni2 nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) and eluted with 200 mM imidazole in 20 mM tris HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, and 5 mM DT T. In vitro phosphorylation was done as described (9). Gel-shift experiments and determination of tetramer stability were done as described (9) with an oligonucleotide containing two copies of the STAT recognition element from the c-fos gene (26) spaced by 10 base pairs (5 -GCCAGTCAGT TCCCGTCAATGCATCAGGT TCCCGTCAATGCAT-3 , binding sites

Transient transfections were done on six-well plates with 50% confluent U3A cells using the calcium phosphate method as instructed by the manufacturer (Stratagene) with the following modifications. Transfection reactions contained 4.5 g per well of either wild-type STAT-1 or the W37A mutant in plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), 4 g of luciferase reporter plasmid pLuc (C. M. Horvath), and 0.4 g of -galactosidase reporter plasmid (Stratagene). The luciferase reporter contained in its Bam HI site as an enhancer element two tandemly arranged weak STAT-1 binding sites (5 -GATCAGT TCCCGTCAATCATGATCCAGT TCCCGTCAATGATCCCCGGGATC-3 ) from the human c-fos promoter. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were treated with interferon- (5 ng/ml, Amgen) for 10 hours or left untreated. Luciferase assays (Promega) and -galactosidase assays (Stratagene) were done according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein expression and Tyr-phosphorylation were checked in gel-shift experiments with whole-cell extracts for both wild-type and mutant protein and were comparable. All results
