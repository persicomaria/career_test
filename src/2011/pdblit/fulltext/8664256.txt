ABSTRACT: We report refined crystal structures of the hexameric soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase from Escherichia coli (E-PPase) to R-factors of 18.3% and 17.1% at 2.2 and 2.3 Å, respectively. Both structures contain two independent monomers in the asymmetric unit of an R32 cell. The difference between the structures is that the latter contains 1.5 Mg2+ ions per monomer. One metal ion binds to the "tight" metal-binding site identified by equilibrium dialysis studies, and is coordinated to Asp65, Asp70, and Asp102. The other metal ion, shared between two monomers at a hitherto unidentified metal-binding site in the dyad interface between trimers, is coordinated through water molecules to Asp26s and Asn24s from the two monomers. The hexamers with metal bound to them are more tightly associated than the ones without metal bound to them. Combined with our other mechanistic and structural data, the results suggest that, at high metal concentrations, E-PPase may bind at least 4.5 metals per monomer: two in the active site before binding substrate, two with substrate, and 0.5 in the dyad interface. Glu20 interacts via a water molecule with Asp70 and appears in the related yeast PPase structure (Heikinheimo, manuscript in preparation) to be involved in binding the second metal ion. Magnesium ion therefore stabilizes the hexamer form through both direct and indirect effects. The direct effect is by tighter association at the subunit interface; the indirect effect occurs because magnesium stabilizes the correct conformation of the loop between Glu20 and Ile32, a loop involved in trimer-trimer interactions. Our results thus provide a structural explanation for the solution studies that show that the E20D variant is partially hexameric and that the hexamer form can be stabilized by binding magnesium ion.

Inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase,1 EC 3.6.1.1) catalyzes the cleavage of pyrophosphate (PPi) into orthophosphate (Pi). Pyrophosphate is a byproduct of DNA and protein synthesis; growing cells produce high levels of PPi. By breaking down PPi, PPases shift the equilibrium of these reactions toward synthesis. Pyrophosphatases are therefore essential constitutive enzymes present in all living cells (Chen et al., 1990; Lahti, 1983; Lundin et al., 1991) whose structures have been highly conserved over evolution (Cooperman et al., 1992;

Kankare et al., 1994; Teplyakov et al., 1994). In addition, bacterial inorganic pyrophosphatases, with a subunit mass of 20 kDa, provide an attractively small protein for studies of energy transduction at the level of phosphoanhydride bond formation and breakdown (Herschlag & Jencks, 1990; Knowles, 1980). PPases are strongly metal-dependent enzymes and require divalent cations, preferably Mg2+ (Cooperman, 1982), for catalytic activity. The role of the magnesium ions in their function is twofold: first, the preferred substrate is Mg2PPi and second, the enzyme binds metal ions as essential cofactors. Detailed atomic information on bacterial PPases only became available in 1994 when three independent X-ray studies were published: a refined 2.0 Å structure of Thermus thermophilus pyrophosphatase (T-PPase) (Teplyakov et al., 1994) and two independent Escherichia coli structures at resolutions of 2.5 Å (Oganessyan et al., 1994) and 2.7 Å (Kankare et al., 1994). The coordinates for all are now available from the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977) with codes of 2PRD, 1IGP, and 1EIP, respectively. In our earlier paper (Kankare et al., 1994), we described the complex topology of E-PPase as a twisted -barrel with excursions, the description of which is still valid (Kankare et al., 1996). The structural core of the enzymesthe fivestranded highly twisted -barrelsis formed by 1, 4, 5, 7, and 6; the barrel is capped on the top with R-helix B (Figure 1), and on the bottom with a loop between -strands © 1996 American Chemical Society

FIGURE 1: Fold of a dimer of E. coli PPase, shown in stereo and drawn using Molscript and Raster3D (Kraulis, 1991; Merritt & Murphy, 1994). The overall topology of the enzyme, as a highly twisted -barrel with excursions, is emphasized. The barrel is in blue; the excursions (labeled with Roman numerals) are in red, and residues in the various oligomeric interfaces are in yellow.

5 and 6. Four longish excursions and a short loop extend from the barrel. It is the top surface of the -barrel and the excursions that form the active site (Figure 1): 12 out of the 17 putative catalytically important active site residues probed by site-directed mutagenesis (Salminen et al., 1995) reside on the excursions. A detailed description of the structure at high resolution will be published elsewhere (Kankare et al., 1996); in this paper, we focus primarily on the differences in the enzyme upon metal ion binding and how that affects the oligomeric structure of the enzyme. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Crystallization and Soaking Experiments. Overexpressed, purified E-PPase (Salminen et al., 1995) crystals were grown as previously described (Heikinheimo et al., 1995). E-PPase crystallized in two different crystal forms in space group R32: a "short-axis form" with cell dimensions of a ) b ) 111.4 Å and c ) 76.6 Å (one monomer per asymmetric unit) and a "long-axis form" with cell dimensions of a ) b ) 110.6 Å and c ) 154.7 Å (two monomers per asymmetric unit). We obtained crystals from 16% PEG 400 and 140 mM MgCl2 in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 (Salminen, unpublished results), but they were too small for data collection. Long-axis form crystals (cell dimensions a ) b ) 110.2 Å, c ) 156.0 Å) also grew from 0.8 M sodium citrate and 100 mM HEPES at pH 8.0. The conditions were sufficiently similar to encourage us to try soaking the citrate-grown crystals overnight in 16% PEG 400, 140 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM inhibitor MHDP in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. We hoped in this way to be able to bind Mg2+ to E-PPase; previous soaking and cocrystallization attempts had been unsuccessful, presumably because of the high concentration of salt. Although most of the crystals cracked, some did not. The ones that survived diffracted to 2.3 Å, and the crystal habit was the long-axis form with unit cell lengths of a ) b ) 109.3 Å and c ) 154.3 Å.

Data Collection, Model Building, and Refinement. All the diffraction data were collected on an RAXIS IIc image plate detector (Sato et al., 1992) using Cu KR radiation. The X-rays were generated using a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode X-ray generator (50 kV and 180 mA) and monochromated with a graphite monochromator. We used the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993) for integrating the intensities, which were rather weak beyond 2.2-2.3 Å. We used the the program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992b; ¨ Brunger et al., 1987) for structure refinement and map ¨ calculation. The models were fitted into the electron density using O (Jones et al., 1991). In all refinements the cutoffs used were lowest resolution 8 Å and data with Fo > 2(Fo). Identification of Magnesium Ion Bound to E-PPase. Metals could be identified as having bound to E-PPase on the basis of the following criteria. First, difference electron density maps calculated at 2.3 Å with coefficients of (Fosoak - Foapo) and phases from the apo-E-PPase model showed two clear peaks: 10 and 5 (Figure 2). Such peaks had been missing from all previous electron density maps calculated from data collected on crystals grown in the presence of magnesium ion with or without inhibitor (Salminen, unpublished results). Second, the peaks were not seen when the concentration of Mg2+ in the soaking solution was lowered to 10 mM. Third, the coordination around the metal ion refined to roughly octahedral geometry (Figure 2). Fourth, the putative Mg2+ ions had quite low temperature factors. Finally, the magnesium-oxygen distances are within the accepted range for water molecules and carboxylates coordinated to magnesium ions: from 1.8 to 2.4 Å. As one of the two peaks (Figure 2) sits on the noncrystallographic 2-fold, its stoichiometry per monomer is 0.5, so the Mg-soaked crystals correspond to an Mg1.5,E-PPase complex. Structure Solution. In brief, the long-axis crystal form model, solved by molecular replacement from the short-axis model (Kankare et al., 1996), was refined with X-PLOR. We kept the noncrystallographic monomers similar by using

the X-PLOR noncrystallographic symmetry restraint option with a weight of 300, but the monomers were rebuilt individually. We omitted 5% of the reflection data for use in the free R-factor calculation (Brunger, 1992a) and used ¨ the behavior of the free R-factor and simulated annealing omit maps (Hodel et al., 1992) to monitor refinement progress and correct errors. The restraints on the monomers were released at 2.2 Å resolution. The conventional R-factor converged to a value of 18.3% with a free R-factor of 23.4% at 2.2 Å resolution (Table 1). The final model contained 168 of the 175 residues in one of the monomers in the asymmetric unit (monomer II) and 173 of the 175 residues in the other (monomer I). Monomers II do not contain residues 98-99 and 146-148, which are in loop regions and apparently disordered, but monomers I do because of a packing interaction (Kankare et al., 1996). The refinement of the Mg1.5,E-PPase structure was straightforward and produced no surprises. The refined long-axis apo model was used directly as the starting model for refinement. A typical refinement cycle was (1) visual inspection of (Fo - Fc), (2Fo - Fc), and (3Fo - 2Fc) electron density maps and manual model building with O (Jones et al., 1991), (2) conventional positional and in the later stages B-factor refinement with X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992b; Brunger ¨ ¨ et al., 1987), and (3) calculation of new maps and (1) repeated. Three simulated annealing refinement runs were done at 2.7, 2.5, and 2.3 Å, using protocols as in the X-PLOR

manual (Brunger, 1992b). There was very little need for ¨ manual rebuilding in between these runs. The noncrystallographically related monomers were restrained with an X-PLOR noncrystallographic symmetry restraint weight of 300, and the restraints were released at 2.3 Å. Waters were added to the model once the resolution reached 2.5 Å by building into peaks in the (Fo - Fc) difference electron density maps that had heights greater than 3.5 and that appeared to have reasonable hydrogen-bonding geometry. Waters were omitted if, in subsequent refinement runs, their temperature factor converged to a value greater than 60 Å2. No atoms were assigned partial occupancy. The final R-factor converged to 17.1% and the free R-factor (8% omitted) to 23.9% (Table 1). The lower resolution of the data is, we believe, the reason for larger differences between free R-factor and conventional R-factor than occurred for the apo long-axis refinement. The secondary structure elements were assigned with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and the hydrogen bonds with HBLUS (McDonald & Thornton, 1994). Structure analysis was done using O (Jones et al., 1991), WHATIF (Vriend, 1990), and X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992b). The images ¨ of the models were generated with Molscript (Kraulis, 1991), and the figure of electron density was with O (Jones et al., 1991). Superpositions were done with RgbSup (Paula Fitzgerald, unpublished program) because it allows one to minimize the number of residues in a superposition

using a variable distance cutoff. This enables one to find small concerted changes against a relatively invariant core protein. RESULTS Oligomeric Contacts. The E20D, Y55F, H136Q, and H140Q variant proteins all dissociate into trimers much more readily than wild type (Baykov et al., 1995; Salminen et al., 1995; Velichko et al., 1995; Volk et al., 1996), but we have yet to find a single amino acid mutant that produces an E-PPase variant with a changed hexamer-dimer equilibrium. This suggests that E-PPase is best thought of as a dimer of trimers. In the long-axis crystal form discussed here, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, the intertrimeric contacts occur around a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis that relates the two trimers of the physiologically relevant E-PPase hexamer (Kankare et al., 1994); the intratrimeric contacts occur around the crystallographic 3-fold axis relating monomers in the trimer. The principal intertrimeric contacts are between two helices A that are part of excursion IV (Figure 1) from 2-foldrelated monomers (Baykov et al., 1995; Kankare et al., 1996). The interaction involves a three-center ionic and hydrogen-bonding interaction, His140-Asp143-His136 (where His136 is on the symmetry-related monomer). The interaction is buttressed with further hydrogen bonds (Kankare et al., 1996).

Another important trimer-trimer interaction occurs between Asn24 and Asp26, part of excursion II. In this region, there are water-mediated hydrogen bonds between Asn24 and Asp26 (but not, in our current model, between Asn24 and Asp26) in the absence of metal ion (Figure 3a). However, the interface contains a site well-suited for binding divalent cation, which occurred when the crystals were soaked in high (140 mM) concentrations of magnesium ion (see Materials and Methods). The Mg2+ ion, which replaced a weakly bound water molecule (Wat51: temperature factor 43), showed clear density in the (Fosoak - Fcapo) difference electron density maps (Figure 3b) and was approximately octahedrally coordinated to six water molecules. Five of the distances were in the range 1.8-2.1 Å, while one was rather longer, at 2.7 Å. Under these conditions, the interface rearranges subtly (Figure 3). The side chains of the Asn24s reorient and become more ordered: their average temperature factor is 18 instead of 32. As a consequence of these rearrangements, the trimers move relative to each other. When the apo monomer II model is superimposed on the Mg-containing monomer II model using RgbSup, the rmsd per R-carbon is 0.27 Å for 167 CR superimposed, and when the apo monomer I model is superimposed on the Mg-containing monomer I model, the rmsd per R-carbon is 0.24 Å for 173 CR superimposed. However, when monomers I are superimposed using the monomers II transformation matrix or Vice Versa, the rmsd per CR is 0.49 Å.

FIGURE 4: Active site of E. coli PPase showing the extensive network of hydrogen bonds (dotted lines). Carbon atoms are in dark gray, oxygen atoms in light gray, and nitrogen atoms in black. The Mg2+ ion is the larger black sphere connected to the ligands we currently see by solid lines. Parts of the CR trace are also shown.

This difference is essentially due to a translation of monomer I toward monomer II by about 0.4 Å along z (translation vector 0.02 Å, 0.09 Å, -0.42 Å). The motion along -z corresponds to a tightening of the trimer-trimer interface and can also be seen in the change in accessible surface area as calculated in the program GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991): in the apo structure, the surface area buried upon forming dimers from monomers is 1321 Å2, whereas in the metal-soaked structure, it increases by 7% to 1414 Å 2. Structure of the ActiVe Site. The description below is based on the active site of the type I monomers for two, possibly interrelated, reasons: they have density for two loops, 98-99 and 146-148 (see Materials and Methods), and they bind Mg2+ more tightly, as evidenced by the temperature factor of the magnesium ion in the active site. The monomer I from the Mg2+-soaked model could be superimposed on the equivalent apo-model monomer with an rmsd per CR of 0.21 Å, indicating that the bound metals induced only slight changes in the overall structure. There are, however, specific changes in the active site geometry (see below). The magnesium ion in the active site is directly coordinated to Asp65, Asp70, and Asp102 (Figure 4). It therefore corresponds to the tightly bound Mg2+ ion which has a binding constant of about 0.06 mM at pH 7.5 [calculated from Baykov et al. (1996)]. Consistent with the structure, the D65E and D102E variant proteins have lowered affinities for the tight metal-binding site (Hyytia, manuscript in ¨ preparation). There is a large network of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, some mediated by water molecules (Figure 4; Table 2). A three-center ionic interaction forms between Lys104, Asp70, and Asp102 that orients Asp70 and Asp102 so that they can bind the Mg2+ ion (Figure 4). Lys104 also forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr55, which is in turn hydrogen bonded to Tyr51.

Upon binding a Mg2+ ion, the active site undergoes a subtle rearrangement. When we used RgbSup (Paula Fitzgerald, unpublished program) with a cutoff of 0.4 Å to compare apo monomer I to metal-containing monomer I, 163 of 173 residues were below the cutoff with an rmsd of 0.21 Å per CR. Ten residues were above the cutoff, with an rmsd of 0.49 Å per CR. The Asp70 and Asp102 loops contain six of the nonmatching residues; two of the other four occur at the C-terminus, and there are two scattered unmatching residues (Pro27 and Lys34). The results for monomer II were similar. Consequently, the Asp65-Asp70 loop moves in toward the metal ion, as does the loop containing Asp102 (Figure 5). Although the average displacements are small, they are concerted. The hydrogen-bonding network also rearranges. In the apo structure, Tyr55 is at the center of a network of hydrogen bonds that stabilize Asp70 (Salminen et al., 1995) (data not shown). In the Mg1.5,E-PPase structure, that role is now filled by Lys104 (Figure 4). This provides a plausible explanation of why the K104R variant shows reduced thermostability and increased Nile Red binding (Kankare et al., 1996). Because of the extensive hydrogen-bonding network of the active site, mutating any residue can distort

the network, affect metal binding, and so affect the pKa of the essential general base and acid (Baykov et al., 1996). In the Mg1.5,E-PPase structure, Glu20 interacts with Asp70 through a water molecule (Figure 4). Furthermore, a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide of Ile32 to the carboxylate of Glu20 helps define the conformation of the loop in between (Figure 6) (Salminen et al., 1995). As this region contains Asn24 and Asp26, part of the trimer-trimer

interface (Figures 1 and 6), it is not surprising that the E20D variant has reduced hexameric stability. In our 2 Å structure of the Mn2,Y-PPase complex (Heikinheimo, manuscript in preparation), a second metal ion is bound to Asp120, the equivalent of Asp70, but on the Glu20 side. Assuming this to be the weaker bound metal ion, the E20D variant would show somewhat weaker binding of the second metal ion (3fold: Table 6; Volk et al., 1996) because the spacing between

4676 Biochemistry, Vol. 35, No. 15, 1996 the carboxylate group and the metal ion would change. By mass action, magnesium binding could affect the conformation of the Glu20-Ile32 loop and thus the hexamer-trimer equilibrium. Lys29, Arg43, and Lys142 appear to bind the substrate (Salminen et al., 1995: Heikinheimo, manuscript in preparation: Hyytia, manuscript in preparation). Teplyakov and ¨ co-workers (1994) located a sulfate ion in the active site which they argued bound in the same location in the active site as Pi would have. This sulfate formed ionic and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the T-PPase residues corresponding to E-PPase Lys29 and Arg43. Comparing the E-PPase active site to the picture of the T-PPase active site in Teplyakov et al. (1994), it is clear that the conformation of Arg43 in the two structures is different, further suggesting (see Materials and Methods) that neither sulfate, phosphate, nor the inhibitor MHDP is present in either the apo-E-PPase model or the Mg1.5,E-PPase. Asp42, a residue that is not conserved between eukaryotic and prokaryotic PPases (Kankare et al., 1994), may orient Arg43 correctly in the active site cavity and also appears to be different in the T-PPase and E-PPase structures. The role of Glu31, Asp67, Asp97, and Glu98 is less clear from our models. The electron density for Glu31 was weak, whether Mg2+ was present or not. Glu98 was disordered in monomer II but not in monomer I, where the loop from 92 to 101 is stabilized by an intramolecular salt bridge between Glu98 and Lys142. DISCUSSION In a difference Fourier synthesis calculated with coefficients Fosoak - Fcapo and using phases from our refined longaxis model, we were able to identify two strong peaks in places where Mg2+ could be expected to bind and with reasonable octahedral geometry. We were thus able to locate magnesium bound to the crystalsssomething that has hitherto not been achieved for a bacterial PPase (Salminen, unpublished observations; Teplyakov, personal communication). In an accompanying paper, we report equilibrium dialysis experiments indicating the presence of three Mg2+ binding sites per monomer in the absence of substrate, with apparent dissociation constants of approximately 0.06-2.6, and 11 mM (Baykov et al., 1996) at the pH (7.5) we employed in the metal-soaking experiments. As already mentioned, the Mg2+ that binds to Asp 65, Asp 70, and Asp 102 at the active site presumably corresponds to the site of highest affinity. This site is also seen in our Mn2,Y-PPase structure (Heikinheimo et al., in preparation) in which one of the Mn2+ ions is bound to the three Asp residues (115, 120, and 152) that align with E-PPase residues 65, 70, and 102 (Cooperman et al., 1992), in agreement with the results of Chirgadze et al. (1991). However, unlike our Mn2,Y-PPase structure, no second Mg2+ is seen at the active site. It is unclear why we do not see the second metal ion in the active site: a conformational change may occur upon binding that is incompatible with this particular crystal form. If this is so, it might explain why many of the crystals soaked in MgCl2 cracked. Alternatively, a second metal ion may be bound at the active site, but at low occupancy, so that we cannot distinguish it from a water molecule. The reason for the absence of density for the inhibitor MHDP is easier to understand. The

Kankare et al. dimagnesium salt of MHDP has limited solubility, and so it precipitates in millimolar concentrations of magnesium (Baykov, unpublished observations). Consequently, no MHDP was available to bind to E-PPase. There is no direct evidence linking the third Mg2+ binding site seen on dialysis to the active site, and it is tempting to speculate that it corresponds to the Mg2+ bound at the interface to Asn24 and Asp26, as reported here. The difficulty, of course, is the stoichiometry of 0.5, based on three Mg2+ per hexamer seen structurally, Versus the apparent stoichiometry of a third full site seen on dialysis. Several possibilities exist. It may be that the third full site has nothing to do with the Asn24-Asp26 site and is not seen for the same reasons that the second site is not. Alternatively, the binding stoichiometry of 3 may actually reflect four sites having monomer stoichiometries of 1.0:1.0:0.5:0.5, and we are observing only two of these sites. Finally, it is possible that a stoichiometry of 2.5 sites/monomer plus some relatively weak, nonspecific binding could be interpreted as 3.0 sites/monomer. This ambiguity might be resolved by dialysis experiments measuring Mg2+ binding stoichiometry to E-PPase variants at residue 24 or 26 that eliminate the Mg2+ binding site identified in this work, assuming no major structural changes on mutation. These variants could also be useful in precisely interpreting the effect of E20D mutation on hexamer stability (Volk et al., 1996). Most important for such stability os the attachment of excursion II (residues 22-53) and excursion IV (residues 110-157) (Figure 1). The trimer-trimer interface around the 2-fold axis is composed of residues from excursion II and residues from excursion IV. Excursion II is bound to the barrel by hydrophobic contacts (Kankare et al., 1996) and by a hydrogen bond between the carboxylate group of the barrel residue Glu20 and the backbone nitrogen of the residue Ile32 (Salminen et al., 1995) (Figure 6). Raising the magnesium concentration could promote hexamer formation in the E20D variant in two ways. First, Y-PPase, with an active site organization that is identical (Heikinheimo, manuscript in preparation), binds a magnesium ion on the Glu20 side of Asp70. Increasing the magnesium concentration in the E20D variant could stabilize the native conformation of the Asp20-Ile32 loop and thus stabilize the excursion II interface. Second, the magnesium bound directly to Asn24 and Asp26 in the loop (Figure 3) creates a more tightly associated hexamer in our structure of wild-type PPase and would be expected to do the same in the E20D variant. Our crystallographic results further suggest that the magnesium and pH dependence of the kinetics of wild-type and variant E-PPases (Baykov et al., 1996: Hyytia, manu¨ script in preparation; Volk et al., 1996) might be at least in part accounted for by the extra 0.5 Mg2+ ion per monomer that we see in the interface region. Preliminary calculations with GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991) (data not shown) suggest that the effect of binding a metal ion at the interface can be seen in the electrostatic potential of the active site. Studies of additional PPase variants both in solution and by crystallography will clearly be important for unraveling detailed aspects of E-PPase structure and function. With refined structures of apo-E-PPase (Kankare et al., 1996), Mg1.5,E-PPase, and Mg2,Y-PPase (Heikinheimo, manuscript in preparation) in hand, we are well placed to start studying the crystallography of PPase variants.
