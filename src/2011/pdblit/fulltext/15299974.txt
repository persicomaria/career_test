Abstract
The three-dimensional crystal structure of the singlestranded DNA-containing ('full') parvovirus, minute virus of mice (MVM), has been determined to 3.5/~ resolution. Both full and empty particles of MVM were crystallized in the monoclinic space group C2 with cell dimensions of a = 448.7, b = 416.7, c = 305.3/~ and /4 = 95.8 °. Diffraction data were collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source using an oscillation camera. The crystals have a pseudo higher R32 space group in which the particles are situated at two special positions with 32 point symmetry, separated by ~c in the hexagonal setting. The self-rotation function showed that the particles are rotated with respect to each other by 60 ° around the pseudo threefold axis. Subsequently, a more detailed analysis of the structure amplitudes demonstrated that the correct space-group symmetry is C2 as given above. Only one of the three twofold axes perpendicular to the threefold axis in the pseudo R32 space group is a 'true' crystallographic twofold axis; the other two are only 'local' non-crystallographic symmetry axes. The known canine parvovirus (CPV) structure was used as a phasing model to initiate realspace electron-density averaging phase improvement. The electron density was easily interpretable and clearly showed the amino-acid differences between MVM and CPV, although the final overall correlation coefficient was only 0.63. The structure of MVM has a large amount of icosahedrally ordered DNA, amounting to 22% of the viral genome, which is significantly more than that found in CPV.

1. Introduction
Parvoviruses are a family of small animal viruses which package their single-stranded (ss) DNA genomcs within non-enveloped T= 1 icosahedral capsids. They are widespread and infect many different animal species from

moths to man. Parvoviral particles have an approximate external radius of 140A and a molecular weight of 5.5-6.2 x 103 kDa. Particles of the murine parvovirus, minute virus of mice (MVM), contain a total of 60 subunits, consisting of three viral proteins designated VPI, VP2 and VP3. There are about nine VPI subunits per particle, with the balance of the subunits being made up of VP2 in empty (lacking DNA) capsids or a mixture of VP2 and VP3 in lull virions (Tattersall, Cawte, Shatkin & Ward, 1976). The dominant capsid protein, VP2, is the C-terminal 64kDa region of the 83 kDa VPI polypeptide. In DNA-containing particles, many VP2 proteins undergo post-assembly cleavage, removing about 20 residues from their amino termini, to generate VP3 (Tattersall, Shatkin & Ward, 1977). The atomic resolution structures of full and empty canine parvovirus (CPV) (Tsao et al., 1991; Wu & Rossmann, 1993) and feline parvovirus (FPV) (Agbandje, McKenna, Rossmann, Strassheim & Parrish, 1993) have been reported. The structural proteins have an eightstranded antiparallel 9-barrel topology, frequently found in viral capsid proteins (Rossmann & Johnson, 1989). The first 37 residues of VP2, containing a predominantly poly-Gly conserved sequence, are not visible in the structures, and probably one in five amino termini are externalized along the fivefold axes. Unlike most other virus capsids, but like the capsid of the ssDNA phage ~X174 (McKenna, McKenna, Xia, Willingmann, Ilag, Krishnaswamy et al., 1992), there are large insertions between the /4-strands of the /4-barrel. These form the principal surface features and adapt the virus to its specific host. One of the surface features of CPV and FPV is a small spike around each of the threefold axes. There are extensive sequence differences between the six parvovirus genera (Murphy et al., 1995) comparable to those between picornavirus genera. MVM and CPV belong to the Parvovirus genus of parvoviridae. Sequence comparisons between MVM and CPV (Chapman & Rossmann, 1993) show that the loops which dominate the viral surface, particularly the threefold spikes, are quite dissimilar. Of the 587 amino acids in VP2 of MVM, 52% are identical to CPV. MVMp, the prototype strain, infects fibroblast cells, while MVMi is an immunosuppressive strain which

MINUTE VIRUS OF MICE approximately 0.91 ]k and a crystal-to-detector distance of 280 or 300 mm. Exposure times varied from 10 to 40 s depending on the size of the crystal. The imaging plates were scanned using a BAS 2000 Fuji scanner with a 100 lam raster step size. To minimize radiation damage, no setting photographs were taken of the randomly oriented crystals (Rossmann & Erickson, 1983). This produced four to 18 useful images per crystal, with diffraction extending to 3.0/~, resolution in most cases. The final data set contained 280 images from 35 crystals of full MVMi particles. The data for the empty particles were less complete, consisting only of 45 images from five crystals. 2.2. Data processing The full particle diffraction data were processed and analyzed first. The 0 S C 1 2 3 (Kim, 1989) and D E N Z O (Otwinowski, 1993) programs were used for initial indexing. Both R32 and C2 were possible space groups, consistent with the crystal symmetry and systematic absences. Initially, the data were processed using the higher symmetry space group R32 in the hexagonal setting with all= 414.2 and cn = 569.5 A (the subscript H denotes the hexagonal setting of R32). However, the scaling of the data was not particularly satisfactory and phase determination appeared to have problems. Thus, the data were reprocessed in the lower symmetry space group, C2 (see below for details). The relationship between the rhombohedral's hexagonal setting and the chosen monoclinic system are shown in Fig. 1 and are given by,

infects lymphocyte T cells (Tattersall & Bratton, 1983); mutations that switch tropism have been shown to map into the VP2 capsid gene (Gardiner & Tattersall, 1988). Most of the MVM host range mutations in VP2 correspond to amino acids that are on the surface of CPV near the edges of the threefold spikes. We report here the rather difficult structure determination of MVMi on account of the pseudo higher order space-group symmetry. Variations of such problems are encountered fairly frequently in the determination of virus crystal structure (Zlotnick et al., 1993; Muckelbauer, Kremer, Minor, Diana et al., 1995), because the crystal lattice is unable to accommodate the complete icosahedral symmetry of the virus particles. Hence, our account of how some of the problems were solved may be helpful in similar situations that are likely to occur in other virus structure determinations. A discussion of the biological implications will be given elsewhere (Agbandje-McKenna, Llamas-Saiz, Wang, Tattersall & Rossmann, 1997).
2. Methods
2.1. Crystallization a n d data collection

MVMi virus was recovered by transfection from the infectious clone pMVMi (Gardiner & Tattersall, 1988) and propagated at low passage in $49 murine lymphoma cells. Infected cells were extracted by freezing and thawing three times in TE 8.7 (50 mM "Iris, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.7). Extracts were cleared by low-speed centrifugation and the virus sedimented to equilibrium through a 60% sucrose cushion over CsCI (1.40 g cm-3), each in the same buffer. For some preparations, this procedure was modified by performing a chloroform extraction step before layering the virus supernatant onto the step gradient. Gradients were fractionated and analyzed by hemagglutination assay (Tattersall et al., 1976). Fractions containing either full virions or empty capsids were separately re-banded in CsCI, dialyzed and concentrated prior to crystallization. Crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapordiffusion method with conditions similar to those used for CPV (Luo, Tsao, Rossmann, Basak & Compans, 1988). The reservoir solution contained 0 . 7 5 % ( w / v ) PEG 8000 and 8 mM CaCI2.2H~O in 10 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 7.5), over which was suspended a 101ul hanging drop produced by mixing 5 ml of virus solution (10mg ml -l) in 10mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 with 5 mi of reservoir solution. Crystals grew to a maximum dimension of 0.4 mm in about 4 to 8 weeks. Crystals of full and empty particles were isomorphous. X-ray diffraction data of both full and empty particles were collected at the FI station of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) using Fuji imaging plates as detectors. The crystals were cooled to 277 K to prevent excessive radiation damage. Oscillation angles of 0.3 and 0.4 ° were used with an X-ray wavelength of

where the subscript M denotes the monoclinic cell parameters. The crystal orientation, mosaicity and cell dimensions were further refined (after sorting out the orientations as described below) using the Purdue data processing package (Rossmann, 1979; Rossmann, Leslie, Abdel-Meguid & Tsukihara, 1979). The final monoclinic cell dimensions were aM = 448.7, bM = 416.7, cM = 305.3/~ and /3M= 95.8 °. When reprocessing in space group C2, data from each crystal were processed using each of the three different twofold axes of the R32 system in turn as the unique monoclinic twofold axis. The images belonging to the same crystal were scaled together for each of the three possible orientations. That orientation which used the true crystallographic twofold axis should have the lowest Rmerg~. The best discrimination was obtained for crystal 17.2 (crystal 17 of the second CHESS trip), for which 18 good images were available (Table 1). This crystal was used as an initial standard to which

other crystal data could be scaled. Crystal 9.3 was found to have a good discrimination (Table 2). The combined data set of crystal 17.2 and 9.3 was used as a new standard to select the correct orientation for the third crystal, and so forth. The gradual increase in data permitted better discrimination, on account of better overlap between the current standard and the data of a crystal with an as yet unknown orientation. This procedure permitted the combination of 15 different crystals. A self-rotation function using these data showed that there was a 2.2 ° deviation from the exact orientation of the particles in space group R32, demonstrating that the data combination had been successful. However, there remained over 30 crystals whose orientation could not be established with confidence. The 15-crystal data set was used to obtain an initial M V M i structure determination (see below), which was used to compute Fc~tc's from the Fourier back-transform of the averaged map. These Fc~lc's included data for the previously unobserved reflections. By scaling to the Fc~,t~'s, it was possible to establish a few more crystal orientations, thus enlarging the standard data set. This data set was used for further cycles of electron-density averaging, yielding an improved set of F~l~'S that was then used for further crystal orientation selection. A total of four such cycles were completed to finally include 35 Trip No. 1 2 3 4 5 Trip date Jan. 1993 Sept. 1993 Apr. 1994 June 1994 Nov. 1994 No. of images 45 84 81 15 55 Adjustedwavelength 0.9087 0.9071 0.9095 0.9124 0.9157

out of 45 possible individual crystal data sets (Table 3). The final data statistics accounted for 64.6% of the data to 3.5 A resolution, with an R,11erg~ of 15.5% and 1.7 measurements of each reflection on average (Table 4). The empty particle data were oriented with respect to the Fc~c's of the completed full particle data set; the final Rmcrge was 15.1%, representing 12.7% of the theoretically possible number of reflections. The diffraction data for the full particles were collected over a series of five different visits to CHESS. As the precise wavelength used on each trip was not necessarily identical, the cell dimensions associated with data from each trip were separately post-refined. Some systematic differences were found in the cell dimensions derived from each trip. All data had been processed assuming a wavelength of 0.908 A. This was adjusted separately for each data trip, relative to post-refined cell dimensions using only the data from trips 2 and 3 (Table 5). The original wavelength was based on a comparison

ANTONIO L. LLAMAS-SAIZ et al. with data collected for human rhinovirus 14, for which the cubic cell dimension had been determined using a Cu Kr~, source. The final Rm~,-g~values were substantially worse than for other viral diffraction data sets collected under similar conditions (Arnold et al., 1987; McKenna, Xia, Willingmann, Ilag & Rossmann, 1992). In these latter cases, the effective mosaic spread was found to be around 0.05 ° by post-refinement, while for MVMi a limit of 0.25 ° was set for both the horizontal and vertical spread to avoid a breakdown of the post-refinement and scaling processes. A separate mosaic spread was postrefined for each crystal, but not each image. Of these, 31 crystals hit either the horizontal, vertical or both mosaic spread limits. A similar proportion hit the limit in the post-refinement of the empty particle data. Clearly, there must have been a large number of partial reflections which were considered to be full, causing the poor R,~,~,~ values. A possible cause of the poor crystal quality may have been that the crystals were extremely temperature sensitive. Extensive precautions were required to stabilize the temperature of the crystal environment, particularly in transportation to CHESS. Changes of few degrees from room temperature caused the crystals to dissolve. 2.3. Structure d e t e r m i n a t i o n The Matthews coefficient (Matthews, 1968), VM, for the pseudo-R32 space group is 2.4,~ 3 Da -I, assuming two virions in the rhombohedral cell (six in the equivalent hexagonal setting). This requires that each particle is situated on a special 32 position, separated by I of t h e hexagonal c , axis. The particles must be rotated relative to each other by 60 °, otherwise the length of the hexagonal CH axis would be halved. This was verified by a self-rotation function (Fig. 1), which clearly shows the two different orientations. In the monoclinic C2 space group, one of the rhombohedral twofold axes becomes the monoclinic twofold axis along bM. Since the rhombohedral threefold axis is perpendicular to the twofold axes, the pseudo-threefold axis in C2 will be in the ac plane, as seen in the rotation function (Fig. 1). In C2, the two independent particles are each situated on a crystallographic twofold axis, giving a total non-crystallographic redundancy of 60. The adjustable parameters are the rotation of each particle about its crystallographic twofold axis and the relative translation of the particles along these axes. Thus, there are three parameters to be determined, with the particle positions being at (0,0,0) and (0,,~ ~,~). The ~ high resolution self-rotation function showed that the particles have moved about the crystallographic twofold by 2.2 ° relative to their average position in space group R32. A more accurate orientation of each of the two particles was determined by making a least-squares fit to the high-resolution rotation-function peaks. The r.m.s. deviations of the ends of the rotation vectors to idealized

icosahedral symmetry are 0.17 and 0.55 ]k, at a radius of 140]k, for the 'blue' and for the 'red' particles, respectively (see Fig. 1 for color definitions). The [P] matrix defines the rotation necessary to orient a standard icosahedron in the 'h cell' to its orientation in the unknown 'p cell', such that X = [P]Y, where X and Y are Cartesian coordinates in the h and p cells, respectively (Rossmann et al., 1992). The [P] matrices for each of the icosahedra were found to be, 0.8686 0.0000 -0.4955 and (00008000 0.0 1.0 \ 019588 0.0 -0.00008 ) for the second 0.958 -0.2840 ('red') particle, 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.4955'~ 0.0000~ for the first 0.8686,,] ('blue') panicle,

where Y is an orthogonal system in the C2 MVMi cell as defined by Rossmann & Blow (1962). The structure of monoclinic CPV was used as an initial phasing model. An electron-density map of CPV was calculated in its P21 cell, using the observed CPV amplitudes and the refined phases that had been obtained by electron-density averaging (Tsa6 et al., 1991, 1992). The resultant averaged map was transformed to the standard orientation in the h cell. This also defined the envelope of the viral particles, as the 60-fold rcdundancy will have removed other neighboring particles that lie outside the reach of the local non-crystallographic symmetry. The h cell contained a structure of a full CPV particle appropriate for interpolation into the MVMi cell.

Map interpretation Although the phase refinement was not as good as had been hoped, the electron-density map calculated at 3.5 ,~ resolution was of high quality. The map was interpreted with respect to the known amino-acid sequence of MVMi, guided by the known CPV structure. In those places where there was an insertion, deletion or a structurally recognizable amino-acid difference, the MVMi structure was invariably obvious, showing that the initial CPV phase bias had been eliminated. The largest difference between MVMi and CPV occurs at the inserted MVMi residues 554-559 (Fig. 3a). The inserted residues are clearly visible on the particle surface. An example of a deletion of three residues of CPV relative to MVMi occurs after MVMi residue 303 (Fig. 3b); a small CPV residue (valine) changed to a larger residue in MVMi (tryptophan) is shown in Fig. 3(c), while the converse, namely a phenylalanine in CPV changed to a leucine in MVMi, is shown in Fig. 3(d). The CPV model was completely rebuilt to fit the MVMi electron density and amino-acid sequence. The polypeptide chain of VP2 could be traced from residue 39 to the carboxy-terminal residue 587, although there were some regions of weaker density. Comparison of the mean radial distance of C(~ atoms between MVMi and CPV showed a small, but definite, linear trend (Fig. 4). At 140/~ radius, the average radial distance of MVMi atoms was 0.5 A greater than in CPV. This

The electron density in the MVMi cell, based on the CPV structure, was Fourier back-transformed. The R factor** and correlation coefficient t (CC) were 40.4 and 0.40, respectively. The first five cycles of molecular replacement electron-density averaging (Rossmann et al., 1992) employed a partial data set which included only the reflections from the original 15 crystals. Unit weights were applied to the Fourier terms and no use was made of the Fc~c values for unobserved reflections. The density was averaged within a spherical shell with inner and outer radii of 70 and 140~, respectively, using planes to separate overlapping spheres. The orientations and relative position of the particles were further refined on 11 different occasions by searching for the parameters that gave minimal scatter between non-crystallographically equivalent density (the 'climb' procedure) (Muckelbauer, Kremer, Minor, Tong et al., 1995) (Table 6). Subsequently, more observed data were introduced and weighted F~L~ values were used where there were no observed reflections. The R factor decreased to 30.8%, and the mean correlation coefficient improved to 0.63. Inspection of the electron density after this phase-improvement procedure, using the interactive graphics program O (Jones, Zou, Cowan & Kjeldgaard, 1991), showed that some surface loops of the capsid had been truncated. Thus, the outer radius was increased to 148 A. Nine more cycles of averaging with a mask based on the averaged h-cell density and using the final data set resulted in the map used for modeling the MVMi structure. The final R factor and correlation coefficients were 30.6 and 0.63, respectively, for all merged data (Table 4, Fig. 2). The non-crystallographic redundancy is only 20 in space group R32, as opposed to 60 in space group C2. The lower redundancy in R32 should produce better correlation coefficients if everything else were equal, but the actual results showed that C2 phase refinement * R = [~l(Fob~- kF,,c)l/~lFob.,I] x 100, where k ~-~Fobs/~Fc:,,c.

MINUTE VIRUS OF MICE which differed in some details around insertions and deletions to that given by Chapman & Rossmann (1993). After completion of the model building, a substantial amount of internal electron density remained uninterpreted. A significant amount of this density corresponded to the 11 DNA nucleotides found in the analysis of CPV (Tsao et al., 1992; Chapman & Rossmann, 1995). Some of the remaining density was interpreted as eight additional DNA nucleotides (Agbandje-McKenna et at.,

might be the result of a true change in the size of the MVMi particle or as a result of poor calibration of wavelength. Since the latter seems more likely, the MVMi coordinates have been adjusted appropriately. The r.m.s, deviation for equivalent C~ atoms between MVMi and CPV was 0.96/~ based on superposition of the icosahedral symmetry axes and 0.94/~ based on the best superposition of the VP2 structure. This comparison determined an alignment (Fig. 5) of MVMi to CPV

The 19 bases seen in one icosahedral asymmetric unit implies that 60 x 19 bases, or approximately 22% of the total genome, display icosahedral symmetry. Refinement of the structure has not yet been completed. A discussion of the structure-function relationships will be given elsewhere (Agbandje-McKenna et al., 1997).

Although the electron density was easy to interpret, the indications of quality, such as Rm~rg~ on the observed data and correlation coefficients, remained poor. It was surprising to find that the space group was not exactly R32, but was really C2. There are several possible explanations for the difficulties in this structure determination. The identification of the monoclinic twofold axis might be in error for some crystals or some of the domains within the same crystal might correspond to R32, while others correspond to C2 symmetry. This could account for the high mosaicity of the crystals, because the different domains do not match exactly. A third possibility would be that the virions themselves lack exact icosahedral symmetry. However, any such deviation would be small and, in many cases, the crystallization process would be unable to select the preferred orientation. Nevertheless, such deviation would create some disorder, accounting for poor data and high mosaicity. Lack of icosahedral symmetry might also be caused by variable composition of the virions with respect to their content of VPI, VP2 and VP3. Such asymmetry might also be caused by interactions between the capsid protein and the unusually large amounts of icosahedrally ordered DNA, which cannot be identical in the various asymmetric units. In general, it would be expected that strictly icosahedral particles would easily crystallize into close-packed arrangements with cubic or trigonal space groups. Usually there is good close packing of particles, but in a surprising number of instances there are small, but irritating, departures, as for example in the crystal packing of coxsackievirus B3 (Muckelbauer, Kremer, Minor, Diana et al., 1995) and nodamura virus (Zlotnick et al., 1993). Like MVMi, both these structures contain two independent particles per crystallographic asymmetric unit and a large amount of nucleic acid folded with icosahedral symmetry. * Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory (Refcrence: I MVM, R IMVMSF).
