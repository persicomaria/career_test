ABSTRACT: G-Proteins cycle between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state, serving as molecular switches that coordinate cellular signaling. We recently used phage display to identify a series of peptides that bind GR subunits in a nucleotide-dependent manner [Johnston, C. A., Willard, F. S., Jezyk, M. R., Fredericks, Z., Bodor, E. T., Jones, M. B., Blaesius, R., Watts, V. J., Harden, T. K., Sondek, J., Ramer, J. K., and Siderovski, D. P. (2005) Structure 13, 1069-1080]. Here we describe the structural features and functions of KB-1753, a peptide that binds selectively to GDP,AlF4-- and GTPSbound states of GRi subunits. KB-1753 blocks interaction of GRtransducin with its effector, cGMP phosphodiesterase, and inhibits transducin-mediated activation of cGMP degradation. Additionally, KB1753 interferes with RGS protein binding and resultant GAP activity. A fluorescent KB-1753 variant was found to act as a sensor for activated GR in vitro. The crystal structure of KB-1753 bound to GRi1,GDP,AlF4- reveals binding to a conserved hydrophobic groove between switch II and R3 helices and, along with supporting biochemical data and previous structural analyses, supports the notion that this is the site of effector interactions for GRi subunits.

Heterotrimeric G-proteins serve as critical relays that transmit cues from extracellular stimuli as diverse as neurotransmitters, hormones, photons, and odorants/tastants to intracellular signaling cascades responsible for eliciting specific cellular effects (1, 2). In the traditional model of G-protein signaling, cell surface G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),1 upon activation by the aforementioned stimuli, catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on the GR subunit. This results in adoption of the active, GTP-bound GR conformation, which dissociates from the G  dimer formerly bound to inactive GR,GDP as a heterotrimeric GR

complex. GR,GTP and freed G  then regulate a variety of downstream effectors by both individual and coordinated mechanisms (1, 2). The GTP-dependent conformational changes within GR required for effector binding are known for GRs bound to adenylyl cyclase (3), GRtransducin (GRt) bound to the -subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) (4), GR13 bound to p115RhoGEF (5), and GRq bound to GRK2 (6). However, no effector-bound structure of GRi1-3 has yet been determined. Signaling of GR,GTP to effectors is terminated by the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity of GR, returning it to the GDP-bound conformation and G  reassociation. GTP hydrolysis can be dramatically enhanced by the family of proteins known as "regulators of G-protein signaling" (RGS), which serve as GTPase-accelerating proteins (GAPs) for GR subunits (7, 8). This model of nucleotide cycling predicts that the duration and intensity of signaling are ultimately determined by the lifetime of GR in the activated, GTP-bound conformation. Therefore, a complete understanding of the molecular determinants of the guanine nucleotide cycle is of particular importance in understanding the temporal aspects governing G-proteinmediated signal transduction.

Structure of Active GRi-Selective Peptide KB-1753 We recently employed phage display technology to identify peptides capable of interacting with GR in a conformation-dependent manner (9, 10). These peptides selectively bind GR by distinguishing key structural orientations of the critical "switch regions" in GR that govern nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis and control interaction with regulatory proteins and effectors (11). In addition to their discriminatory binding properties, these peptides can possess intrinsic regulatory properties that provide insight into the regulation of GR signaling. For example, we recently described the molecular basis for the interaction of a GDPselective peptide, KB-752, with GR,GDP (10). KB-752 serves as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) in vitro, and the structure of the GR-KB-752 complex provided insight into the role of switch II displacement in the mechanism of GPCR-mediated nucleotide exchange, a process that remains largely elusive (12-14). Several other groups have also used similar techniques to identify GRand G -binding peptides that have provided insight with regard to the mechanics of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling (15-18). Here we describe the crystal structure of a peptide, KB1753, that interacts exclusively with activated GRi subunits, including the closely related GRtransducin. The structure of the KB-1753-GRi1,GDP,AlF4- complex reveals the molecular determinants of nucleotide-selective binding of KB-1753 to GR, highlighting the importance of the disposition of the switch II helix. KB-1753 competitively antagonizes the binding of PDE to GRt, suggesting that KB-1753 binds in a fashion similar to that of effectors. Additionally, KB-1753 prevents RGS protein binding and resultant GAP activity toward GRi1 and GRt. We also demonstrate the utility of a fluorescently modified KB-1753 to serve as a sensor for activated GRi1 in vitro. Collectively, our results represent the first structure of GRi1 engaging an activation-stateselective target in its effector-binding region and underscore the usefulness of the KB-1753 peptide as a tool for studying G-protein signal transduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. Unless noted, all reagents were from Sigma. Peptides were synthesized by Anaspec (San Jose, CA), except for the C-terminal cysteine variant of KB-1753 and PDE(63-87) (GLGTDITVICPWEAFNHLELHELAQYGII), which were synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility (directed by M. Berne). KB-1753/YFP Plasmid Construction. Oligonucleotides encoding KB-1753 were constructed with 5-KpnI and 3BamHI overhangs: sense, 5-CGT CTT CTC GAG GTT ACT ACC ATG GTA TTT GGG TGG GTG AAG AAG GTC GAC TTT CTC GAT GC-3; and antisense, 5-GAT CGC ATC GAG AAA GTC GAC CTT CTT CAC CCA CCC AAA TAC CAT GGT AGT AAC CTC GAG AAG ACG GTA C-3; 100 ng of each primer were mixed, denatured, annealed (55 °C for 1 min), and cooled prior to ligation into KpnI- and BamHI-digested pEYFP-N1 (Clontech). To avoid steric hindrance of the KB-1753-GR interaction by YFP, we inserted a flexible linker (Gly-SerGly-Gly-Ser-Gly) between KB-1753 and YFP by insertional mutagenesis (QuickChange, Stratagene) with the following primers: sense, 5-CGA CTT TCT CGA TGC GGA TCT

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 38, 2006 11391 GGT GGC TCA GGG GAT CCA CCG GTC GCC-3; and antisense, 5-GGC GAC CGG TGG ATC CCC TGA GCC ACC AGA TCC GCA TCG AGA AAG TCG-3. The KB1753-linker-YFP open reading frame was then isolated using PCR [30 cycles of 95 °C denaturing (30 s), 55 °C annealing (1 min), and 72 °C extension (1 min)] using primers (sense, 5-TAC TTC CAA TCC AAT GCG TCT TCT CGA GGT TAC TAC CAT GGT ATT-3; and antisense, 5-TTA TCC ACT TCC AAT GCG CTA CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CAT GCC GAG AGT-3) and then subcloned into an N-terminal His6-tagged vector using a ligation-independent strategy described previously (19). Protein Production. His6-tagged N-terminally truncated human GRi1 (N-GRi1), as well as full-length GRi2, GRi3, and GRoA subunits, was purified from Escherichia coli as previously described (20, 21). The His6-tagged RGS12 RGS domain (amino acids 702-846 of SwissProt entry O08774) was cloned into pMCSG7 using a ligation-independent cloning strategy (19) and purified as described for GRi1. His6tagged human RGS16 (amino acids 53-190; ref 22) was prepared from the expression construct pLIC-SGC1-RGS16s001 obtained from SGC (Oxford), per their published protocol (PDB entry 2BT2). Transducin heterotrimer and PDE6 were purified from bovine retinas as described previously (23); urea-treated photoreceptor membranes used as the source of photoactivated rhodopsin were purified from bovine retinas as previously described (24). Surface Plasmon Resonance. SPR binding assays were performed at 25 °C using a BIAcore 3000 instrument. N-Terminally biotinylated KB-1753 or PDE(63-87) peptides {diluted to 0.1 µg/mL in BIA-run buffer [10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 0.005% NP40]} were coupled to flow cells of streptavidin biosensors (Biacore) to a surface density of 500 RU. GR subunits were diluted in BIA-run buffer in the presence of 100 µM GDP, 100 µM GDP with 30 µM AlCl3 and 10 mM NaF, or 100 µM GTPS and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. GR subunits in desired nucleotide states (30 µL) were then injected over flow cells at 10 µL/min, followed by a 300 s dissociation phase. To correct for nonspecific binding and buffer shift artifacts, binding curves from a surface containing a control peptide (mNOTCH1; ref 25) were subtracted from all binding curves. Surfaces were regenerated with two 10 µL injections of 500 mM NaCl with 25 mM NaOH at 20 µL/min. BIAevaluation version 3.0 was used for binding curve and kinetic analyses. Dissociation constants (KD) were determined by saturation binding as previously described (20, 21). Crystallization and Structure Determination. N-GRi1 protein [25 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, 10 µM GDP, 30 µM AlCl3, and 10 mM NaF] was incubated with a 1.5-fold molar excess of KB-1753 at room temperature for 5 min prior to screening. Initial crystals were obtained in condition 28 of the PEG-Ion Screen (Hampton Research) and refined to final crystallization conditions of 15% PEG-8000 and 0.3 M calcium acetate using the vapor diffusion method with 8 µL hanging drops with a 1:1 protein:buffer volume ratio.

A 2.8 Å native data set was collected at Brookhaven National Laboratory using the x29 beamline. Data were scaled and indexed using HKL2000 (26). The structure of GRi1,GDP,AlF4- (PDB entry 1GFI), excluding waters, GDP, and AlF4-, was used for molecular replacement (27). Initial solutions were found with correlation coefficients of 57.5 and a starting R-factor of 47.6, which was reduced to 39.7 with an initial round of refinement. Model building was completed using O (28), with successive rounds of simulated annealing, minimization, and B-group and rigid body refinements being completed by CNS (29). Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were used in initial cycles of refinement, and both GRi1-KB-1753 dimers were essentially identical. All electron density map calculations were completed with CNS. N-Terminal residues 25-32 of GRi1 were disordered along with residues 112-121 in the RBRC loop of the all-helical domain; these segments were excluded in the final GRi1-KB-1753 model. All structural images were generated using PyMol (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). PDE6 ActiVity Assays. PDE6 activity was measured as described previously (30). Briefly, illuminated urea-treated photoreceptor membranes (20 µL; final rhodopsin concentration of 10 µM), a source of photoexcited rhodopsin, were reconstituted with purified transducin (1 µM) at room temperature in buffer containing 10 µL of GTPS, 100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). When needed, 20 µM wild-type or mutant KB-1753 peptide was also added. PDE6 (0.05 µM) was added immediately before the reaction was initiated by addition of 10 µL of [3H]cGMP (2.5 mM containing 105 dpm/sample) and terminated by addition of 100 µL of 0.1 M HCl. The mixture was then neutralized with 100 µL of 0.1 M Tris and incubated with 75 µL of king cobra snake venom (1 mg/mL) for 1 h to convert GMP to guanosine. The solution was then passed through an anion exchange DEAE-Sepharose column to separate guanosine from cGMP and washed twice with 0.8 mL of H2O. The eluent was mixed with 10 mL of ScintiSafe cocktail, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. GTPase Assays. Single-turnover GTPase assays with GRi1 were conducted as described previously (31). Briefly, 100 nM GRi1 was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min in buffer C [50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.05% C12E10, 1 mM DTT, 5 µg/mL BSA, 10 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl] containing 1 × 106 cpm of [-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol). Samples were then placed on ice for 5 min. Reactions (on ice) were initiated by adding 10 mM MgCl2 (with 100 µM GTPS), and timed reaction aliquots were quenched with a charcoal slurry [containing 20 mM H3PO4 (pH 3)] followed by centrifugation (4000g for 10 min at 4 °C). Supernatants with free -32Pi were analyzed by scintillation counting. Background counts (in the absence of GRi1) were subtracted from all experimental conditions. Multiple-turnover GTPase assays with GRt were conducted as described previously (32). Briefly, illuminated urea-treated photoreceptor membranes were mixed with transducin at room temperature in a buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris,HCl (pH 7.8), and 1 mM DTT. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 µL of [-32P]GTP at a desired concentration (final concentration of 20

Johnston et al. µM; approximately 105 dpm/sample) to 20 µL of membranes (final concentrations of 10 µM rhodopsin and 1 µM transducin) supplemented with additional proteins and/or peptides when needed. The reaction was stopped by 100 µL of 6% perchloric acid. 32Pi formation was assessed with activated charcoal. In the experiment addressing the effect of PDE on RGS16 GAP activity, the PDE(63-87) peptide was used instead of full-length PDE because this peptide completely substitutes for PDE in RGS protein regulation but, unlike PDE, does not block repetitive transducin activation by rhodopsin (33). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Assays. FRET assays for GR-RGS interaction, along with purification of GRi1-CFP and YFP-RGS4, were completed as described previously (34). GRi1-CFP was diluted in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 µM GDP. Experiments on the effects of AlF4activation were performed in buffer supplemented with 30 µM AlCl3 and 10 mM NaF. Measurements were taken with a LS-55B spectrofluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer). Emission scans were performed at 20 nm/min using excitation of 433 nm, with slit widths of 5 nm. Emission maxima used for CFP and YFP were 474 and 525 nm, respectively. For peptide competition experiments, GRi1 (200 nM) was allowed to incubate in the quartz cuvette with wild-type or mutant KB1753 (2 µM) for 2 min prior to addition of YFP-RGS4. RESULTS Identification of an ActiVated-State-SelectiVe GR Binding Peptide. To identify peptides capable of interacting with GR selectively in the activated conformation, we performed phage display analysis as previously described for peptides that bind inactivated, GDP-bound GR (9, 10). Of the GTPSdependent GRi1 binding peptides that were obtained, seven peptides shared a consensus sequence of three hydrophobic residues centered around tryptophan and flanked by glycines (Figure 1A). A MOTIF search (http://motif.genome.jp/) of the Swiss-Prot protein database (35) with the degenerate sequence motif G-[IV]-W-[ILMSVW]-G revealed 166 proteins bearing this peptide signature across all represented genomes, but none was a known G-protein effector (data not shown). From this family of seven peptides, the longest and most avid binder, KB-1753, became the focus of our current efforts. To quantitate the nucleotide-dependent interaction of KB-1753 with GRi1, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements on a streptavidin biosensor coated with biotinylated KB-1753. Injection of GRi1,GDP,AlF4- or GRi1,GTPS analytes yielded robust binding to KB-1753, whereas GRi1,GDP exhibited no detectable interaction (Figure 1B). To assess the affinity of these interactions, dissociation constants (KD values) were obtained by saturation binding using a previously described technique (20, 21). As shown in Figure 1C, GRi1 in both the transition state (GDP,AlF4-) and activated state (GTPS) interacts with KB-1753 with a low micromolar affinity. KB-1753 bound with the highest affinity to GRi2,GDP,AlF4-, nearly 10-fold better than the affinity for either GRi1 or GRi3 (Figure 1C). No appreciable affinity was detected for the GDP-bound conformation of any of these GRi subunits, confirming the results of the original phage selection (10). A chimeric GR subunit that closely mimics transducin ("RT*" in which the corresponding region from GRi1 was inserted between

No binding (KD > 1000 µM) was seen with any GR in the GDP-bound state.

residues 215 and 294 of GRt, herein denoted GRt/i1) (36) also interacted with KB-1753 in a nucleotide-dependent manner. Interestingly, no detectable affinity was observed for the closely related GRoA subunit or the more divergent G-protein, GRs (Figure 1C). OVerall Structure of the GRi1,GDP,AlF4--KB-1753 Complex. To understand the molecular details of the nucleotidedependent interaction of KB-1753 with GR, we determined the structure of KB-1753 bound to GRi1,GDP,AlF4- by X-ray diffraction crystallography (Table 1). The conformation of GR,GDP,AlF4- closely resembles that of GR,GTPS (37, 38), and AlF4- addition activates GR signaling in vitro (39). The overall structure of GRi1 consists of two principal lobes: a Ras-like domain similar to the monomeric GTPase fold and an additional all-helical domain (11); the guanine nucleotide binding pocket lies between these two domains. The planar anion AlF4-, GDP, and Mg2+ are all found in

the GRi1-KB-1753 structure as predicted (Figure 2A). Three flexible switch regions, responsible for the conformational changes involved in the guanine nucleotide cycle (11), aid in the binding of AlF4- and Mg2+ (Figure 2A). Two nearly identical GRi1-KB-1753 dimers exist in the asymmetric unit with a rmsd of 0.64 Å. Residues Arg-3Glu-13 of the KB-1753 peptide (S1SRGYYHGIWVGEEGRLSR19) were sufficiently ordered to confidently model them on the basis of electron density (Figure 2B,C). KB1753 binds within the Ras-like domain of GRi1 in a highly conserved hydrophobic cleft formed by the R2 (switch II) and R3 helices (Figure 2). This cleft represents the proposed effector-binding site for GRi1 (40) and suggests that KB1753 binds in an "effector-like" mode to activated-state GR (see below). Notably, binding of KB-1753 does not significantly alter the conformation of GRi1 as the overall rmsd between bound and unbound structures was calculated to be 0.81 Å. Hydrophobic residues dominate the GRi1-KB-1753 binding interface, including Ile-9 of KB-1753, which lies buried within the hydrophobic pocket created by GRi1 residues Trp-211 and Phe-215. Conservative replacement of this isoleucine with valine leads to a 5-fold decrease in binding affinity, whereas alanine substitution at Ile-9 (in combination with the critical Trp-10; see below) completely abolishes interaction of KB-1753 with GRi1 (Figure 3B). Additional van der Waals contacts are made between His-7 and Ile-212 within this pocket. Other KB-1753-GRi1 contacts include the following: Val-11-Arg-208, Trp-10-

Lys-248, Trp-10-Ser-252, His-7-Asn-256, and Gly-8-Asn256 (Figures 2B and 3A). When bound to GRi1, KB-1753 assumes a hairpin secondary structure centered about residues Tyr-6 and His-7, with several stabilizing intramolecular contacts aiding the adoption of this hairpin (e.g., Figure 2B). The position of the imidazole nitrogen of His-7 raises the possibility of a cation- interaction with Tyr-6 at the hinge of the hairpin loop. Mutation of this histidine results in a 7-fold reduction in binding affinity ("H7F", Figure 3C). Other intramolecular contacts within the bound conformation of KB-1753 include the following: Gly-4-Val-11, Gly-4-Gly-12, Tyr-5-Trp10, Tyr-6-Ile-9, and Tyr-6-Val-11 (Figures 2B and 3A). Figure 2C illustrates the electron density depicting the confidence of model building of KB-1753 and its interaction with GRi1. Molecular Basis of Nucleotide-Dependent Interaction. Binding of an activating nucleotide such as GTP, GTPS, or GDP,AlF4- to GR induces specific structural changes in the three switch regions. The conformations of these switch regions are very similar in the GR,GDP,AlF4- and GR, GTPS forms (11), explaining the ability of KB-1753 to bind these two conformations equipotently. In these active con-

formations, Arg-208 in switch II makes a critical contact with Glu-245 of the R3 helix, just beyond switch III, which helps stabilize the switch II conformation (37, 38). Interestingly, the indole nitrogen of Trp-10 in KB-1753 exploits this interaction and makes contacts with both Arg-208 and Glu245 (Figure 2B). These interactions may thus partially contribute to the selective nature of binding of KB-1753 to activated GR, as switch II is entirely disordered in the structure of GR,GDP likely due to a lack of stabilization with switch III (11). Indeed, this conserved glutamate residue makes contacts with effectors in the structures of GRt-PDE, GR13-p115-RhoGEF, and GRq-GRK2 dimers, although the contributing effector residues are not tryptophan as seen here with KB-1753 (6). However, the exact degree to which this interaction aids in the nucleotide selectivity of KB-1753 cannot be inferred as Trp-10 may play other critical roles in the GR-KB-1753 interaction, such as stabilization of the peptide conformation. The hydrophobic binding pocket created by Trp-211 and Phe-215 likely also contributes to the nucleotide selectivity of KB-1753. The overall architecture of this pocket perfectly accommodates Ile-9 of KB-1753. A highly conservative replacement of Ile-9 with valine, lacking a single methyl

extension, results in a loss of binding affinity ("I9V", Figure 3C). Furthermore, given the inherent flexibility of switch II in the GDP-bound state (11), the integrity of this pocket would be compromised in the inactive conformation. Our recent structural analysis of GRi1 bound to a GDP-selective peptide, KB-752, revealed a similar mode of interaction with the Trp-211-Phe-215 pocket (10). In the case of KB-752, however, a tryptophan from the peptide was perfectly accommodated by the Trp-211-Phe-215 hydrophobic pocket only in the inactive conformation, given that active conformations sterically clash with the larger tryptophan side chain (10). These results underscore the critical involvement of the hydrophobic pocket formed from the R2 and R3 helices in binding these regulatory peptides and dictating their nucleotide selectivities. KB-1753 Blocks GR-Effector Interaction. The binding site for KB-1753 on GRi1 lies in the putative effector-binding region. Mutational analyses implicate this region as the binding site on GRi1 for adenylyl cyclase (40). Moreover, GRs-adenylyl cyclase and GRt-PDE crystal structures have established the R2-R3 pocket, along with the R2- 4 loop, as the effector binding site for these G-protein subunits (3, 4). As GRt and GRi1 are members of the same GR subfamily, we focused on the GRt-PDE interaction to show that KB-1753 binds to the GR effector-binding site and could

(B) Wild-type KB-1753 competes with PDE for binding to GR, but not the I9A/W10A mutant peptide or the GRi1,GDPselective peptide KB-752. AlF4--activated GRt/i1 protein (8.5 µM) was preincubated with the indicated concentrations of competitor peptide prior to injection over a streptavidin SPR surface bearing biotinylated PDE(63-87). The inset shows SPR surfaces coated with either biotinylated KB-1753 or PDE peptide bind with equivalent affinity to the GRt/i1 chimera bound to GDP and AlF4-. (C) Rates of cGMP hydrolysis to GMP by transducin-activated PDE6 (0.05 µM) in the absence (control) or presence of 20 µM wild-type or mutant KB-1753 peptides were calculated from linear fits of the data: control, 9.2 µM GMP produced per second; wildtype KB-1753, 1.1 µM GMP produced per second; and I9A/W10A mutant KB-1753, 9.1 µM GMP produced per second. The data were taken from one of three similar experiments.

thus serve as a unique effector antagonist. The GRi1-KB1753 and GRt-PDE structures indicate similar modes of GR interaction between these two peptides (Figure 4A). We first demonstrated using SPR that a soluble GRt/i1 chimera [containing GRi1 sequence from residue 215 (end of helix R2) through 294 (start of helix R4); ref 36] could bind both

Note that contacts made to GRi1,GDP,AlF4- by RGS4 (blue) and by KB-1753 (green) are not overlapping, yet steric hindrance is predicted between bound KB-1753 and the R5-R6 loop of RGS4 (amino acids 120-123 shown in space-filling mode). (C) Single-turnover GTP hydrolysis assay using [-32P]GTP-labeled GRi1 (0.1 µM) in the absence or presence of 0.1 µM RGS12 RGS domain, 1 µM KB-1753, or both.

(E) Effect of 2 µM KB-1753 peptide (wild type or I9A/W10A mutant) on AlF4--dependent FRET between 0.2 µM GRi1-CFP and 0.2 µM YFP-RGS4 fusion proteins; FRET was quantified by the emission ratio (525 nm/474 nm), representing the ratio of YFP emission to CFP emission maxima upon excitation at 433 nm.

KB-1753 and a peptide comprising residues 63-87 of PDE (Figure 4B inset). We next tested whether KB-1753 and PDE exhibit mutually exclusive binding to GRt/i1. As expected, preincubation of GRt/i1 with free KB-1753 inhibited (in a dose-dependent manner) binding of GRt/i1,GDP,AlF4to biotinylated KB-1753 immobilized on the SPR biosensor (data not shown). Preincubation with KB-1753 also abrogated binding of GRt/i1,GDP,AlF4- to a biotinylated PDE peptide surface (Figure 4B). These results establish that KB-1753 competes for binding of the effector (PDE) to GRt/i1, suggesting that KB-1753 could serve as an effector antagonist in the transducin-PDE signaling pathway. We thus tested whether KB-1753 could perturb interaction of wild-type GRt with, and signaling to, cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) by reconstituting these proteins with photoreceptor membranes containing light-activatable rhodopsin, the receptor upstream of transducin. As part of the phototransduction signaling pathway, GRt,GTP activates PDE6 by binding directly to PDE and releasing the inhibitory constraint which PDE imposes on the R and catalytic subunits of PDE6 (41). We tested whether KB-1753 could impair PDE6 activation by GRt,GTP by measuring the steady-state rate of cGMP degradation to GMP. Rhodop-

sin-activated transducin was observed to stimulate degradation of cGMP in reconstituted ROS membranes (Figure 4C). KB-1753, but not the I9A/W10A substituted peptide, nearly abolished the stimulation of PDE6 cGMP hydrolysis activity (Figure 4C). Together, the results from SPR competition binding and PDE6 activity assays confirm the ability of KB1753 to interdict GPCR-mediated signaling through activated G-proteins to effector enzyme activity and suggest that KB1753 could serve as a novel tool for antagonizing these signaling pathways. KB-1753 Interferes with RGS Protein GAP ActiVity. We also reasoned that, by binding to the transition-state mimetic form of GR (GR,GDP,AlF4-), KB-1753 may alter the intrinsic and/or RGS protein-stimulated GTPase activity of GRt and GRi1. The experiments conducted with wild-type GRt reconstituted with photoreceptor membranes revealed the presence of both effects (Figure 5A). Addition of KB1753 caused a nearly 2-fold increase in the basal rate of GRt GTPase activity. This activity may arise from stabilization of switch II by KB-1753 in a conformation suitable for the catalytic Gln-204 of GR to more efficiently participate in GTP hydrolysis. Addition of KB-1753 also caused an 40% reversal of GTPase acceleration by an RGS protein, RGS16,

Structure of Active GRi-Selective Peptide KB-1753 previously shown to act on GRt (42). Neither effect was observed with the control I9A/W10A substituted peptide. The partial inhibition of RGS16 GAP activity by KB-1753 was very similar to the well-documented partial inhibition caused by PDE (lowest bar in Figure 5A; see refs 43 and 44 for original observation). Comparing the GR-KB-1753 and GR-RGS4 structures reveals no significant alterations in the overall GR backbone (rmsd of 0.68 Å) or of the critical catalytic residues (R178, T181, and Q204). However, space-filling models of KB1753 and RGS4 indicate that, although KB-1753 binds to the effector-binding region of GR, which is exclusive from the RGS protein-binding interface (5, 6), the C-terminus of KB-1753 could sterically hinder the access of the RGS protein to its GR binding site (Figure 5B). KB-1753 significantly blocked the GAP activity of RGS12 on GRi1 (Figure 5C,D), suggesting that KB-1753 interferes with RGS protein binding. We also observed a small peptide-dependent acceleration of basal GRi1 GTPase activity (Figure 5C), although, unlike in the case of wild-type GRt (Figure 5A), this effect was not statistically significant. Using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay for GR-RGS protein interactions (34), we confirmed that KB1753 is able to block the direct interaction between RGS4 and GRi1 (Figure 5E). Thus, KB-1753 serves as a novel peptide inhibitor of GRi1-RGS protein interaction and RGSmediated GAP activity in vitro. A Fusion of KB-1753 with the Yellow Fluorescent Protein SerVes as a Sensor for ActiVated GR. Fluorescent biosensors have become instrumental for investigating protein-protein interactions as well as protein activation in real time and visualizing the spatiotemporal aspects of signal transduction in live cells (45, 46). The ability of KB-1753 to bind only activated GR makes it a potentially useful tool for developing novel biosensors for G-protein activation. In an initial test of this hypothesis, we employed FRET between chromatic variants of the Aequoria Victoria green fluorescent protein in which excitation of a donor cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) in turn excites an acceptor yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) when these variants are within defined distance constraints (50 Å) (47). We subcloned the KB-1753 peptide sequence N-terminal to YFP (KB-1753-YFP) to serve as a FRET acceptor for CFP-modified GRi1 (Figure 5B; ref 34). KB1753-YFP underwent a robust FRET response with CFPGRi1, selectively in the presence of aluminum tetrafluoride (Figure 6A,B) and with an affinity of 750 nM (Figure 6C). Incubation of CFP-GRi1 with excess unmodified KB-1753 (but not the I9A/W10A mutant) blocked the FRET response (Figure 6B). These results validate KB-1753-YFP as a bona fide FRET partner for detecting the activated conformation of CFP-tagged GRi1, a form of KB-1753 that could be directly applied to in vivo settings (45, 46). DISCUSSION The structural basis of G-protein regulation resides in subtle conformational changes in three critical switch regions of the GR subunit (11). When GDP is released from the inactive, G -complexed conformation, GR binds GTP and adopts the active conformation capable of regulating effector molecules. Regulatory proteins (such as RGS proteins and GoLoco proteins) exploit these distinct nucleotide-dependent

conformations of GR for their binding and modulation of the nucleotide cycle (7, 8, 48). Here, we have described a peptide, KB-1753, capable of interacting with specific GR subunits solely in active conformations. The crystal structure of this peptide bound to GRi1,GDP,AlF4- reveals an "effector-like" mode of binding, relying on the specific conformation of the switch II helix. KB-1753 serves as an effector antagonist as well as an inhibitor of RGS protein activity. These qualities make KB-1753 an attractive new tool for studying G-protein signaling. The development of biosensors for activated GR using KB-1753 should open new avenues for both in vitro assay design and real-time in vivo imaging of GR activation.

FIGURE 7: Conserved structural features of engagement of GR by effectors and by KB-1753. (A) Multiple-sequence alignment derived from Clustal-X (59) of human GRi1 (GenBank entry AAM12619), bovine GRt (SwissProt entry P04695), human GRo (SwissProt entry P09471), human GR13 (GenBank entry NP_006563), and bovine GRs (SwissProt entry P04896) sequences, highlighting locations of switch II and switch III, as well as conservation of three hydrophobic residues involved in effector engagement (green boxes). Burial of a key hydrophobic residue of an effector (red) within a conserved hydrophobic cleft between switch II (R2) and R3 helices of activated GR (blue; switch regions colored green) is apparent in the crystal structures of GRs,GTPS bound to the second cytoplasmic domain of type II adenylyl cyclase (AC) [B (3)], GRt,GDP,AlF4- bound to the  subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) [C (4)], the N-terminal RGS domain of the RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factor p115RhoGEF interacting with GDP,AlF4--bound GR13/i-5, a chimeric GR subunit based on GRi1 but containing the three switch regions and the helical domain of GR13 [D (5)], and GRi1,GDP,AlF4- bound to the KB-1753 peptide [E (this study)].

Currently, available GR-effector structures include those of GRs-adenylyl cyclase, GRq-GRK2, GR13-p115RhoGEF, and GRt-PDE-RGS9 complexes (3-6). Although GRt belongs to the GRi family, currently no specific structural analysis of a GRi1-3-effector complex exists. Thus, the GRi1-KB-1753 complex represents the first structural glimpse of GRi1 engaged in an effector-like recognition mode, albeit with a nonphysiological target. On the basis of the GRsadenylyl cyclase structure and the pseudosymmetry of the

C1 and C2 cytosolic lobes of adenylyl cyclase (3), mutational analysis has identified residues within the C1 lobe of type V adenylyl cyclase (ACV) critical to GRi1 regulation (49). Specifically, these critical C1 lobe residues reside in the R1R2 and R3- 4 segments of ACV, with the latter segment proposed to bind within the switch II-R3 cleft of GRi, the binding site for KB-1753. However, no significant sequence similarity was observed between KB-1753 and the R3- 4 loop of ACV. A sequence of SLVREMTGVNV within the

Structure of Active GRi-Selective Peptide KB-1753 ACV R3- 4 loop has been implicated in binding the switch II-R3 cleft of GRi; bold, underlined residues indicate particular positions that, when mutated, result in loss of GRimediated inhibition (49). Aside from a general hydrophobic character in this region of ACV that may complement the hydrophobic cleft in GR, no significant homology with KB1753 exists. Thus, KB-1753 appears to be a unique sequence that exploits the same effector-binding region of GRi1 and suggests that diverse primary sequences in effectors may recognize a similar binding motif within GR. Indeed, the switch II-R3 cleft utilized by effectors is highly conserved among GR subfamilies (Figure 7) (3-6); therefore, diversity within effectors, in either primary sequence or tertiary structure, must compensate for the common GR binding groove to allow for signaling specificity (6). This difficulty in defining GR-effector specificity based on the conserved nature of structurally defined interactions has been previously discussed (6). Another possibility is that additional regions of GR define effector specificity by complementing the conserved interactions within the switch II-R3 cleft. For example, regions within the R4- 6 loop of GRi2 (specifically 314 RKDTKE319) have been implicated in the interaction with adenylyl cyclase (40). However, KB-1753 makes no contact within this region of GR. Also, the R2- 4 and R3- 5 regions of GR have been implicated in effector binding; however, with the exception of GRs, these sequences are also highly conserved (6). The ability of KB-1753 to inhibit binding and signaling of wild-type transducin to PDE6, an effector with which KB-1753 also lacks significant sequence similarity, signifies its effector-like mode of binding to GRi1 and further underscores the sequence diversity in effectors available for GR subunit recognition. KB-1753 is a potentially attractive new tool for studying G-protein signaling. If modified to allow cell penetration (e.g., ref 50), KB-1753 could effectively block GRi,GTPeffector signaling while preserving receptor-heterotrimer coupling and G -mediated signaling, unlike pertussis toxin which permanently impairs GRi  coupling and signaling via ADP ribosylation (51) or of siRNA-mediated Gnai transcript silencing which can result in compensatory upregulation of other GRi/o family members (52). The selective interaction of KB-1753 with GRi subunits over GRo (Figure 1B) would provide another advantage in interrogating GPCR coupling specificity over pertussis toxin, the latter acting nonspecifically on all GRi/o subfamily members except GRz (53). The ability of KB-1753 to block RGS protein binding and resultant GAP activity highlights yet another potential usefulness of this novel peptide. Biosensors capable of visualizing the spatiotemporal aspects of protein activation and protein-protein interactions have become indispensable tools for studying signal transduction events within the context of live cells (47, 54). Several studies using CFP/YFP FRET and related techniques have investigated GPCR signaling dynamics (55-58). Studies aimed at examining heterotrimer activation have used designs wherein activation leads to a reduction in the magnitude of the FRET response due to the dissociation of a GR-CFP and G -YFP coupled pair (for example, ref 57). Although innovative and informative, these studies are limited by their reliance on a loss of FRET response which presents specific technical challenges (such as correcting for photobleaching artifacts) and limits the ability to track the

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 38, 2006 11399 spatiotemporal aspects of GR signaling once activated. Our KB-1753-YFP species, however, presents an attractive alternative design that produces an increase in the level of the FRET response following GR activation (Figure 6) and should allow resolution of the spatiotemporal dynamics of activated GR signaling. Moreover, as GR becomes deactivated, a loss of FRET response would be expected, given that KB-1753-YFP binds selectively to only the activated form. Thus, a FRET-based approach with KB-1753-YFP could report both the activation and deactivation dynamics of GR signaling, potentially improving the resolution of previous studies. We are now avidly working toward this goal. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Dr. C. McCudden for GRi2, GRi3, and RGS12 constructs, Dr. D. Doyle (SGC Oxford, Oxford, U.K.) for the RGS16 plasmid, and Drs. R.
