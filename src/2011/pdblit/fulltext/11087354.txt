ABSTRACT: Monocyte chemotactic protein 2 (MCP-2) is a CC chemokine that utilizes multiple cellular receptors to attract and activate human leukocytes. MCP-2 is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 by virtue of its high-affinity binding to the receptor CCR5, one of the major coreceptors for HIV-1. Although a few structures of CC chemokines have been reported, none of these was determined with the N-terminal pyroglutamic acid residue (pGlu1) and a complete C-terminus. pGlu1 is essential for the chemotactic activity of MCP-2. Recombinant MCP-2 has Gln1 at the N terminus, 12-15% of which cyclizes automatically and forms pGlu1. The chemotactic activity of such MCP-2 mixture, which contains 1215% pGlu1-form and 85-88% Gln1-form protein, is 10 times lower when compared with that of fully cyclized MCP-2 preparation. Therefore, this chemokine is practically inactive without pGlu1. We have determined the complete crystal structure of MCP-2 that contains both pGlu1 and an intact C-terminus. With the existence of pGlu1, the conformation of the N-terminus allows two additional interactions between the two subunits of MCP-2 dimer: a hydrogen bond between pGlu1 and Asn17 and a salt bridge between Asp3 and Arg18. Consequently, both pGlu1 are anchored and buried, and thereby, both N-terminal regions are protected against protease degradation. We have also observed not previously reported extended helical nature of the C terminal region, which covers residues 58-74.

Chemokines are important mediators of inflammatory and immunological responses. On the basis of the positions of first two cysteine residues, most chemokines belong to either the CXC or CC subfamily (1-3). Although the major biological function of chemokines is believed to be their capacity to induce leukocyte migration and activation, accumulating evidence suggests critical roles of chemokines in development, hematopoiesis, lymphocyte trafficking and homing, angiogenesis, and malignancy. Chemokines bind and activate seven transmembrane G protein-coupled cell surface receptors, some of which, CCR5 and CXCR4 in particular, are major coreceptors used by HIV-1 to enter and infect human cells (4, 5). Therefore, the cognate chemokine ligands for CCR5 and CXCR4 are host derived anti-HIV-1 proteins by competitively occupying the HIV-1 coreceptors. Monocyte chemotactic protein 2 (MCP-2)1 is a member of the CC

chemokine subfamily copurified with MCP-1 and MCP-3 from human osteosarcoma and mononuclear cell supernatants (6). MCP-2 shares 60% amino acid identity with MCP-1 and MCP-3, and 30% identity with other CC chemokines such as MIP-1R, MIP-1 , and RANTES. Because of its capacity to interact with multiple receptors, MCP-2 chemoattracts and activates a variety of leukocyte populations. In addition to sharing CCR1 with MIP-1R, RANTES and MCP3, and CCR2b with MCP-1 and MCP-3, MCP-2 binds and activates CCR5 (7). Therefore, like other CCR5 ligands such as MIP-1R, MIP-1 , and RANTES, MCP-2 is also a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 strains that use CCR5 as a coreceptor. The structures of several CXC (8-15) and CC (16-22) chemokines have been solved. The common features of CXC and CC chemokines include a central three-stranded antiparallel -sheet, an overlying C-terminal R-helix, and two disulfide bridges (Figure 1). Although the structures of MCP-1 (17, 19) and MCP-3 (20, 23) have been reported, none of these was determined with the N-terminal pyroglutamic acid residue (pGlu1) and with a complete Cterminus. The pGlu1 residue has been postulated to be essential to the conformation of the N-terminus and the biological activity

of MCP proteins. To address the biological significance of pGlu1 in MCP-2, we have cloned and expressed this chemokine with N-terminal Gln1 in Escherichia coli, purified the recombinant protein to homogeneity, and chemically converted Gln1 at the N-terminus into pGlu1 (24). We found that pGlu1 is essential for the chemotactic activity of MCP-2 and that it protects the N-terminal region against protease degradation (24). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Mass Spectrometry. Recombinant MCP-2 was expressed in E. coli and purified with HPLC as previously described (24). All mass spectra were measured on an Esquire LC/ MS ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonic, Bremen, Germany) with direct infusion of the diluted HPLC fractions (1/30 dilution in 1/1 acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 5 µL/min. For the average of more than 100 spectra, the error on the relative molecular mass of a 10-kDa protein should be 1 Da or smaller. Figure 2, panel a is the averaged profile spectrum (averages of 238 spectra). The deconvolution of the averaged profile spectrum (Figure 2, panel b) shows the relative molecular masses of both MCP-2 forms. The theoretical average relative molecular mass for MCP-2 with Gln1 at the N terminus is 8910.4, whereas it is 8893.3 for the protein with the N-terminal pGlu1. According to the peak intensities in Figure 2, panel b, 15% of the MCP-2 is spontaneously converted into the pGlu1-form. For a second preparation of recombinant MCP2, 12% of the purified chemokines was spontaneously converted into the pGlu1-form (data not shown). Crystallization and Data Collection. The chemical conversion of the recombinant MCP-2 was performed as previously

described (24). Crystals of MCP-2 grew in hanging drops at well-controlled room temperature. The drops contained equal volumes of reservoir and protein stock solutions. The protein stock solution contained 3 mg/mL protein in 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), and the reservoir solution contained 40% ammonium sulfate in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The bipyramid hexagonal microcrystals appeared in 1 h, and they reached the final size (0.25 × 0.25 × 0.55 mm) in 2 weeks. The protein crystallized in hexagonal space group P6122 with one MCP-2 molecule in the asymmetric unit and diffracted to 2.0-Å resolution. The unit cell dimensions were a ) b ) 61.01 Å and c ) 114.93 Å. The solvent content of the crystals was 63%, and the Matthews number (Vm) was 3.6 Å3/Da (Matthews, 1968). The data set was collected from a single crystal at 100 K with an ADSC Quantum4 CCD system mounted on synchrotron beamline X9B at the National Synchrotron Light Source in Brookhaven National Laboratory (Upton, NY). Mineral oil (Sigma M3516) was used as the cryoprotectant and suspension medium to mount the crystal in the cryo loop. Data processing was carried out with the HKL2000 suite (25). The data set consisted of 9060 unique reflections, within the resolution range of 20.0 to 2.0 Å, reduced from a total of 38 808 measurements and was 99.0% complete. The internal R-factor between symmetryrelated reflections was 5.6% (Table 1). Crystal Structure Determination and Refinement. The crystal structure of MCP-2 was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (26). The search model was a single molecule of MCP-1 (19) without solvent. The solution from molecular replacement after rotation and translation search consisted of a single molecule and had a correlation coefficient of 0.53 and a crystallographic R-factor

was continued by the addition of water molecules and further adjustment of side chains that showed deviation from the electron density. After each round of refinement, the entire model was inspected with the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps. Water molecules with B-factors higher than 80 Å2 were rejected. The refinement of the model with integrated water molecules clearly defined the position of the last five residues at the C terminus and the conformation of pGlu1. Final refinement was performed with the program SHELXL-97 (28), against all data within the resolution range of 20.0 to 2.0 Å, using the least-squares block-diagonal matrix technique. After the structure was completed, all water molecules were verified with a series of omit maps; 30 water molecules were removed and verified each time. The model building and adjustment were carried out with the O graphics package (29). The final structure contains all non-hydrogen atoms of the full-length polypeptide chain and 89 water molecules. The model refinement and final statistics are summarized in Table 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Complete Structure of Human MCP-2. Human MCP-2 exists in two isoforms, MCP-2Lys46 and MCP-2Gln46, with identical patterns of receptor interaction and biological activity (24). We have determined the crystal structure of MCP-2Gln46 that contains 76 amino acid residues and 89 water molecules at 2.0-Å resolution. The accuracy of the atomic positions versus the resolution derived from the Luzzati plot shows a coordinate error of 0.22 Å. As indicated by the Ramachandran plot (30), all main-chain dihedral angles are found in favorable regions. All atoms are in good agreement with the final electron density contoured at 1.0  except for the side chains of Phe71 and Leu74 in the C-terminal region. All water molecules have densities above 1.0  in the final 2Fo - Fc map. The architecture of the human MCP-2 monomer is similar to that of other previously reported CC chemokines, such as MCP-1 (17, 19), MCP-3 (20), MIP-1 (18), RANTES (16, 21, 22), and eotaxin (31). The secondary structure elements of human MCP-2 are organized with the topology R310N1- 1- 2- 3-R1 (Figure 1). Residues 3 to 7 in MCP-2 form a short R310-helix followed by an irregular N1-strand (residues 9-11) that is linked to 1 via an extended loop

of 0.43. The model of MCP-2, containing residues 2 to 71, was built and was initially refined with the program X-PLOR (27) against data in the resolution range 8.0 to 2.0 Å. The refinement was started with the rigid-body procedure and was continued using simulated annealing. After the first round of refinement, the Fo - Fc map showed the density for pGlu1 and that for five residues at the C-terminus. Since the new density was not readily interpretable at this stage, the pGlu1 and five C-terminal residues were not built. The uncertain segments of the model were checked and adjusted with simulated annealed omit maps. Further model building

Blaszczyk et al. nase (35, 36). The roles of pGlu1 have been proposed to form a hydrogen bond with C-terminal residues or participate in substrate binding. For instance, the N- and C-termini of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone interact with each other via the formation of a hydrogen bond between the pyrrolidone carbonyl group of pGlu1 and the glycinamide group (34). Such interaction is critical for the formation of receptor binding conformation of the hormone. In onconase, pGlu1 not only forms a hydrogen bond with Val96 in the C-terminal -sheet but is also part of the active site for substrate binding (36). A recombinant onconase with an N-terminal methionine (Met0) proceeding Gln1 showed decreased cytotoxicity and enzymatic activity, while cleavage of Met0 and cyclizing Gln1 to reform pGlu1 reconstituted the cytotoxicity and ribonucleolytic activity of this enzyme (35). pGlu1 of MCP-2 is Essential to the Conformation of N-Terminus. The N- and C-termini are far apart in a single molecule of MCP-2 (Figure 1). Therefore, pGlu1 cannot form a hydrogen bond with a C-terminal residue as observed for onconase where pGlu1 folds back against the N-terminal R-helix (36). In MCP-2, pGlu1 points forward such that its pyrrolidone carbonyl group points to the same direction as the carboxylic side chain of Asp3. Thus in dimeric MCP-2, the N-terminus of one subunit is able to form a hydrogen bond and a salt bridge with residues in the loop following N1 in the other subunit (Figure 4, panel a, and Figure 5, panel a, this work), in addition to an identical set of six hydrogen bonds between the two subunits previously reported for MCP-1 (19). Four of these six hydrogen bonds are between the main-chain atoms of Ile9 and Cys11 on both N1-strands, of which the average distance is 3.0 Å (Figure 4, panel b). The fifth hydrogen bond is between the hydroxyl groups of Thr10 from both monomers with a distance of 2.65 Å (Figure 4, panel b), and the sixth is between the carbonyl oxygen atom of Ser6 and the amide nitrogen atom of Cys52 (not shown for clarity). Furthermore, a water molecule is present within the hydrogen bond distance to the carbonyl oxygen of Ile9 and the amide nitrogen of Cys11 in both subunits (Figure 4, panel b). Although the waterbridged interactions have also been reported for MCP-1 (19), the two interactions involving pGlu1 and Asp3 in one subunit with Asn17 and Arg18 in the other have not been observed in any other MCP structures, in which pGlu1 is either absent or replaced with Gln1. Figure 5, panel a, schematically represents the MCP-2 dimer showing the secondary-structure features and Figure 5, panel b, illustrates the alignment of three MCP dimers derived from their crystal structures, including MCP-2 (this work) and the I-form2 (with a monomer in the asymmetric unit) and P-form (with a dimer in the asymmetric unit) MCP-1 (19). Unlike the MCP-2 structure, both MCP-1 structures were determined with N-terminal Gln1. The superposition was done via optimizing the alignment of one subunit. Although in general, MCP-2 is very similar to the P-form MCP-1 and less similar to the I-form, striking conformational differences have been revealed at the Ntermini between the three MCPs. The N-termini of MCP-1 do not have a unique conformation, as evidenced by the

(residues 12-24). 1 (residues 25-31), 2 (residues 4045), and 3 (residues 50-53) fold into a three-stranded antiparallel -sheet, which is part of a Greek key motif and is followed by the C-terminal helix R1 (residues 58-74). Two disulfide bridges between four cysteine residues (Figure 3) show a left-handed spiral conformation (Figure 1). The first bridge, Cys11-Cys36, couples N1 with the hairpin loop between 1 and 2, and the second one, Cys12-Cys52, connects N1 and 3 (Figure 1). Therefore, the disulfide bonds, as in other CC chemokines, play an important role in stabilizing the -structure of MCP-2. The stabilization of the MCP-2 -structure is also assisted by the side chain of Gln46, which forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Gln23 and with NH1 of Arg24. Gln46 is located in the turn between 2 and 3, whereas Gln23 and Arg24 are at the beginning of 1. Similar interactions can be predicted for MCP-2Lys46, where Lys46 should be able to form a hydrogen bond with Gln23, although the interaction between Lys46 and Arg24 is not favorable. This finding is consistent with the results of biological assays, which have demonstrated that the two variants of human MCP-2 do not differ significantly in their function (24). pGlu1 is Essential for the Chemotactic ActiVity of MCP2. We have previously demonstrated that the chemotactic activity of the recombinant MCP-2 with N-terminal Gln1 is 10 times lower than that of the pGlu1 version (24). In this study, we have established that before the chemical conversion of Gln1 to pGlu1, there is 85-88% Gln1-form and 1215% pGlu1-form in the recombinant protein (Figure 2), indicating that 12-15% of the Gln1 cyclizes automatically and form pGlu1, which is consistent with the 10-fold lower chemotactic activity when compared with 100% cyclized MCP-2. We therefore conclude that pGlu1 is essential for the chemotactic activity of MCP-2 and that this chemokine is practically inactive without it. The N-terminal pGlu1 is essential for the biological activity of many proteins such as peptide hormones thyrotropin-releasing hormone (32, 33), luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (34), and a cytotoxic ribonuclease onco-

MCP-2 dimer are anchored to the loops following the N1 strands. Therefore, we conclude that pGlu1 is essential to the conformation of N terminus, which allows the N-terminal interaction with the other subunit, and thus, both N-terminal regions are protected against protease degradation. Mobility of the Polypeptide Chain and C-Terminal Helix. Our MCP-2 structure provides the first complete structure of any MCP protein with its native pGlu1 at the N-terminus and a 4.5-turn helix at the C-terminus (Figures 1 and 4). The mobility of a polypeptide chain can be indicated by the B-factors of the main chain atoms (Figure 6). MCP-2 has increased mobility in both the N- and C-terminal regions. In addition, two regions, residues 15-24 and 46-50, display higher-than-average mobility. The first region is the loop between N1 and 1, and the second region is the turn between 2 and 3. The higher-than-average mobility in

region 15-24 is correlated with an even higher mobility of the N-terminal region because the N-terminus is anchored to this loop (region 15-24, Figure 4, panel a, and Figure 5). Such correlation is not observed for MCP-1 because the N-terminus points away from the loop following N1 (Figure 5, panel b, and Figure 6). The mobility in region 46-50 propagates into the C-terminal helix, of which the last helical turn (region 71-74) and residues Lys75 and Pro76 show the highest mobility (Figure 6). The side chain of Lys75 has multiple conformations and those of Phe71 and Leu74 are not well-defined (Figure 4, panel c), most likely because the C-terminal region of MCP-2 is not involved in intermolecular interactions. In the crystal structures of MCP-1, the last five residues at the C-terminus of P-form and the last six residues at the C-terminus of I-form are missing (19). The NMR structures of MCP-1 (17) and MCP-3 (20, 23) did not show

Complete Structure of Human MCP-2 the helical nature of region 71-74. Although the C-terminal structure has previously been determined for AOP-RANTES (16, 21, 22) and MIP-1 (18), the C-terminus in these two proteins is six residues shorter than that of MCPs (Figure 3) and, therefore, has only three turns. The three-turn C-terminal helix of AOP-RANTES has been observed in both crystal (22) and NMR (16, 21) structures and that of MIP-1 has been defined by NMR only (18). Therefore, it is evident that the C-terminus of CC chemokines is completely helical, an observation that may be functionally important. pGlu1, Dimerization, and N-Terminal Protection in MCP2. The crystal structure of MCP-2 reveals a "four-legged" architecture (Figure 5, panel a). Two of the four legs are the negatively charged C-termini. The side chains of Gln23, Arg24, Gln46, and Arg47 in the two subunits form another two legs. Because the two variants of MCP-2Lys46 and MCP2Gln46 use same receptors and exhibit identical biological activity (24), the number of charges on these two legs may not necessarily be important for their function. Although the physiological significance of this four-legged architecture remains unresolved, our dimeric structure does shed light on the protease stability of MCP-2. We have previously demonstrated that N-terminal pGlu1 protects the N terminal region against degradation by CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV, an aminopeptidase able to cleave Pro-Xaa bonds (24). The crystal structures of MCP-2 (this work) and MCP-1 (19) suggest that with pGlu1, the N-termini of dimeric MCP are involved in subunit-subunit interactions (Figure 4, panel a, and Figure 5) and therefore are buried and protected against the protease cleavage and that the N-terminus of Gln1-form MCP does not interact with the other subunit (Figure 5, panel b) and therefore is exposed and not protected.
