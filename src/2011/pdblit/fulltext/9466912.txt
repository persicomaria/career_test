Abstract
The sequence of a NAD(P)-reducing hydrogenase operon of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 containing genes for a small and a large hydrogenase subunit and six additional ORFs was determined. Until now only 11 of the 14 polypeptides of the NADH-dehydrogenase of E. coli were found in Synechocystis. By sequence homologies we suggest that the missing subunits of the peripheral part of the dehydrogenase, containing most of the FeS-clusters, are encoded by three ORFs of this operon. This hypothesis is discussed in relation to the NAD(P)-reducing hydrogenase of Synechocystis.

Hydrogenases are enzymes which catalyze the oxidation of hydrogen and the reduction of protons to hydrogen. They contain several iron-sulfur clusters and the active site consists either of a nickel- and an iron-ion held in close proximity by bridging ligands in the case of NiFe-hydrogenases [ 11 or a special iron-sulfur cluster (H-cluster) in Fe-only hydrogenases. For decades the o' ccurrence of hydrogenases in

algae [2,3] and cyanobacteria [4,5] has been known. The existence of at least two different enzymes in cyanobacteria, called uptake and reversible hydrogenase, was shown by biochemical, physiological and immunological methods [5]. Recently a major breakthrough in the molecular characterization of these enzymes was achieved. Through the study of a genomic rearrangement in heterocysts of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 the sequence for the large subunit of a membrane bound hydrogenase was found [6] and in Anabaena uariubilis the sequence of an operon for a NAD(P)-reducing hydrogenase was reported [7]. In the latter enzyme, which is best characterized in Alculigenes eutrophus [8], a dimeric hydrogenase moiety with a small subunit containing one FeS-cluster and a large Ni-containing subunit is thought to be combined with a dimeric

diaphorase moiety, which catalyzes the transfer of the electrons to NAD+ or as in a Fe-only hydrogenase of Desulfovibrio fructosouoruns to NADP+ [9]. In search for a hydrogenase in the unicellular non-N,-fixing cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 two degenerated PCR-primers (A A/G CG T/GATT/CTGT/CGGT/CA/GTT/GTG upstream, A/G CA A/G GC A/C A A/G A/G CA A/G GG A/G TC downstream) were made from the conserved Ni-binding motifs of Ni-hydrogenases [lo]. By comparison with the data bank using the blast server [l l] one of the obtained PCR-products turned out to be part of a hydrogenase gene. This product was used to screen a A-ZAP genomic library of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which was kindly provided by Prof. L. McIntosh (DOE-PRL, MSU, East Lansing, MI, USA). Two of the positive overlapping clones were chosen (6.0 kb and 6.9 kb in length, respectively) and subjected to deletion subcloning with the erase-a-base kit from Promega. Sequencing was performed by the chain-termination method of Sanger et al. [12]. The first strand was sequenced with the deletion subclones and the second by primer sequencing. The sequence was in addition to the blast server analysed with the Dnasis program (Hitachi). It was identified as an operon for a NAD(P)-reducing NiFe-hydrogenase. So this enzyme belongs to the class IV hydrogenases in the system of Wu and Mandrand [ 131. The overall order of the structural genes for the hydrogenase reported here is the same as in the hoxS operon of A. eutrophus [8] and the hox operon in A. uar-iabilis [7] (Fig. 1) though the arrangement of unidentified ORFs (nos. 3, 6, 7) is different to A. uariubilis. The unidentified ORFs in Synechocystis, encoding putative proteins of 24, 10 and 17 kDa, gave no significant homologies in the data bank search. They are located between hoxF and hoxU (ORF 3) and between hoxY and hoxH (ORF 6 and 71, respectively. In addition to the sequence of A. vuriubilis [7] we sequenced an ORF (hoxE) upstream of hoxF. HoxE in Synechocystis shows highest homology to HndA of D. fructosovoruns (33% identical amino acids) (Fig. 2). It is homologous to the 24 kDa precursor protein of the mitochondrial complex I and the nuoE gene product of E. coli (nuo: NADHubiquinone oxidoreductase) [ 141. With these proteins

it shares the consensus CX,CX,CXGXC, which is likely to harbor a [2Fe-2S]-cluster [15] (Fig. 2). The product of the hoxF gene is 65% identical to HoxF of A. vuriabilis and 45% identical to HndC of D. fructosouoruns. It has a high homology to the mitochondrial 5 1 kDa subunit of complex I [ 161. The motifs assigned for the binding of NAD+ and FMN are found between amino acids 167 to 206 and 285 to 333, respectively. The N-terminal 100 amino acids contain the same motif of cysteines as in HoxE and are showing highest homology to the [2Fe-2S]-ferredoxin of Clostridium pasteuriunum [17]. At the C-terminus the consensus for a [4Fe-4S]-cluster as in HoxF of A. eutrophus, A. vuriubilis and HndC of D. fructosovoruns is found. The polypeptide derived from the hoxU gene is 61% identical to HoxU of A. uuriubilis and 34% identical to the first 240 amino acids of HndD of D. fructosovoruns or other Fe-only hydrogenases from C. pasteuriunum (reversible hydrogenase I> [ 181, Clostridium ucetobutylicum ATCC 824 [ 191, Clostridium ucetobutylicum P262 [20], Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (hydrogenase C) [21], respectively. All of these proteins including HoxU of A. eutrophus show a consensus of PXLCX ,,_,,CRXCXVX r , _ r6C that probably coordinates a [2Fe-2S]-cluster. Both cyanobacterial proteins and the Fe-only hydrogenases have a 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin like consensus CX,CX,CX,CX,CX,CX,CX,CP, which is lacking the proline after the fourth cysteine. Only the first three and the last cysteine of this sequence are found in HoxU of A. eutrophus and the 78 kDa precursor of the mitochondrial complex I or NuoG of E. coli [14]. But in NuoG th ere is a similar motif typical for a [4Fe-4S]-cluster 25 amino acids apart from the first. These subunits and the Fe-only hydrogenases show the motif HX,CX,CX,C near position 100. In all of the hoxU genes sequenced to date the histidine is only one amino acid apart from the first cysteine in a completely conserved sequence EGNHXC (Fig. 3). So in this case another [4Fe-4S]-cluster could either be coordinated by a histidine similar to the small subunit of the crystallized Desulfouibrio gigus hydrogenase [22] or this sequence is a consensus for a [3Fe-4S]-cluster. Such a cluster was predicted by EPR studies in the Nocurdiu opucu hydrogenase [23], but was not found in the hydrogenase of A. eutro-

number of FeS-clusters the cyanobacterial HoxU, but not HoxU of A. eutrophus, contains the same amount of possible ligands for these clusters as the Fe-only hydrogenases and NuoG. The only difference being a 2[4Fe-4S]-motif in the hydrogenase proteins and two successive [4Fe-4S]-motifs in the complex I protein (Figs. 2 and 3). Since the cyanobacterial HoxU and the Fe-only hydrogenases are almost identical in respect of their cysteine motifs apart from the motif assigned to the H-cluster, spectroscopical studies of the latter enzymes are important. In the hydrogenase I from C. pasteurianum besides the H-cluster, which contains probably 6 Fe-atoms, at least three other [4Fe-4S]-clusters from the ferredoxin type (F-cluster) were detected by EPR [26]. Since this enzyme contains about 20 Fe atoms this fits very well with one

(6Fe) H-cluster, 3 [4Fe-4S]-clusters and one additional [2Fe-2S]-cluster. Raman studies of the same enzyme now confirmed the existence of a [2Fe-2S]cluster [27]. By sequence comparison it seems likely that all these clusters, with the exception of the H-cluster, could also be found in the HoxU proteins of cyanobacteria. HoxY of Synechocystis is 65% and 35% identical to the corresponding peptide sequences in A. variabilis and A. eutrophus, respectively. It contains the typical consensus for the small subunit of NiFe-hydrogenases (CXGCX .GxCX ,GX,GCPP), which is present in a similar form (GCX,EX.GXCX,GX,GCPP) in the PSST subunit of complex I or nuoB in E. coli as already reported by Albracht [28]. By X-ray crystallography this sequence was found to coordinate the proximal [4Fe-

The first four highlighted cysteines are thought to ligate a [2Fe-2S]-cluster, the following three cysteines with a preceding histidine could harbor a [4Fe-4S]-cluster. Only the histidine three amino acids ahead of the first cysteine is conserved in the NuoG homologs. The last eight cysteines in the alignment are coordinating 2[4Fe-4S]-clusters in the hydrogenase genes as in the homologous bacterial ferredoxins. This last motif is spread into two single [4Fe-4S]-motifs in NuoG.

4S]-cluster in the small subunit of the D. gigas hydrogenase [22]. This cluster is unique to NiFe-hydrogenases and is the (only one found in the small subunits of the NAD(P)-reducing hydrogenases, while there are two additional FeS-clusters in periplasmic hydrogenases of Desulj' ouibrio species [22] and the uptake hydrogenases. The large subunit HoxH of Synechocystis is 65% identical to the corresponding protein of Anabaena and it has the typical consensus motifs for the Nibinding active site of NiFe-hydrogenases [lo]. Deletion mutants of hoxH were made in Synechocystis

by replacing part of hoxH with a kanamycin-cassette [29,30]. These mutants lack the methylviologen-dependent hydrogen evolution activity of the wild type completely (Appel, J., Phunpruch, S., and Schulz, R., unpublished data). For many years the homology of the NAD-reducing hydrogenase subunits HoxF and HoxU with proteins of the NADH-dehydrogenase (complex I> has been emphasized [ 16,28,3 1,321. Interestingly we found in Synechocystis the same arrangement of the genes hoxE, hoxF and hoxU as in the nuo operon (genes nuoE, F and G) for the NADH-dehydrogenase of E. coli with a similar pattern of putative FeS-cluster binding motifs (Fig. 2). Since these three genes of the NADH-dehydrogenase are still missing in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts [33] it seems plausible that hoxE, hoxF and hoxU could overtake the function of the nuo homologs in cyanobacteria. This is further supported by a DNA segment upstream of hoxF (position 779 to 868 in Fig. I), which is highly homologous to an allophycocyanin-promotor consensus derived from several Synechocystis strains [34]. Therefore a constitutive expression of at least part of the operon (hoxF, ORF 3, hoxU) is possible as one might expect for a functional NAD(P)H-dehydrogenase under normal aerobic conditions. Since a high hydrogenase activity coupled to hoxH is detectable only under anaerobic conditions (Appel, J., and Schulz, R., unpublished data) the genes coding for the hydrogenase moiety seem to be differently regulated. Physiological investigations and inhibitor studies of the photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport in chloroplasts of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [35] were taken by these authors as evidence for a hydrogenase activity, which donates electrons to the NAD(P)H-dehydrogenase. Since a similar tight coupling of these electron transport chains is proposed in cyanobacteria [36] a similar function of the hydrogenase in Synechocystis is plausible. Immunogold-labeling studies performed for the cellular localization of the reversible (NAD-reducing) hydrogenase in cyanobacteria showed either a high labeling at the cytoplasmic membrane in Anacystis nidulans [37] or in the thylakoidal region of non-N,fixing cells of Anabaena uariabilis ATCC 29413 [38]. Thus membrane association of this hydrogenase in cyanobacteria should be considered. The results

146

obtained by Kentemich et al. [37] led these authors to the suggestion that the reversible hydrogenase should be a component of an electron transport chain of the cytoplasmic membrane [39]. As the isolated NAD-reducing hydrogenases of A. eutrophus is known to be soluble [40] in Synechocystis this enzyme could be peripherally linked to the NAD(P)H-dehydrogenase. The hypothesis that a special [4Fe-4S]-center in the hoxU gene product serves as a link between H,metabolism and respiration in A. nidulans [41] and the hypothesis of a joint use of the subunits Hox F and HoxU by the hydrogenase and the dehydrogenase presented for Synechocystis in this work both couple the reversible hydrogenase directly to the NAD(P)Hdehydrogenase (complex I) as its electron acceptor. The diaphorase subunits HoxF and HoxU have to be localized at the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane [7,42] or the cytoplasmic face of the thylakoids [36,43] to fulfill their expected task in the dehydrogenase. We think that this implies a hydrogenase localized at the same side of the membrane, since it should be in direct contact to HoxF and HoxU as in the soluble hydrogenase of A. eutrophus [S]. This view is in contrast to the presumed orientation of the hydrogenase to the periplasmic face of the membrane by [7,42]. The fact that no transit peptides could be found in HoxY of A. variubilis [7] and Synechocystis supports this hypothesis. Independently Bothe et al. (Cologne, Germany) have reached the same conclusion as presented in this paper for Synechocystis, albeit with a different organism, and submitted the results for publication elsewhere. In order to learn more about the function of the box genes in Synechocystis transcriptional studies, biochemical and physiological investigations of mutants and the wild type are currently in progress.
