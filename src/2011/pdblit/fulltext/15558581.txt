Introduction. Chaperonins are ubiquitous proteins that control the folding of other proteins denatured by various stresses, such as heat shock.1 They consist of two types of proteins, cpn60 (60 kDa) and cpn10 (10 kDa). The GroEL (cpn60)-GroES (cpn10) complex from Escherichia coli is the most thoroughly studied chaperonin system.2,3 GroEL forms a tetradecameric oligomer with a cylinder shape, and GroES forms a dome-shaped heptamer. The end of the large central cavity of the GroEL tetradecamer binds to the unfolding substrate polypeptide. Afterwards ATP binds to GroEL, and then this large cavity is closed upon capping by GroES. Then, ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP, and the refolded polypeptide is released into solution. The structures of cpn60 of several species, including the E. coli GroEL-GroES complex4 (PDB code: 1AON), have been reported, and the crystal structures of cpn10 from E. coli,5 Mycobacterium tuberculosis6,7 (PDB code: 1HX5, 1P3H), Mycobacterium leprae8 (PDB code: 1LEP), and bacteriophage T4 Gp319 (PDB code: 1G31) have been reported. All cpn10 structures are homo-heptameric and dome-shaped, and each monomer form similar folds as small -barrel with a highly flexible long loop, the so-called "mobile loop." In the crystal structure of the E. coli GroEL-GroES complex, this mobile loop makes contact with the GroEL tetradecamer. It has also been reported that some cpn10s have additional functions; for example, the M. tuberculosis and M. leprae cpn10s are strong immunogens10 and M. tuberculosis cpn10 forms a tetradecamer with divalent cations.7 M. tuberculosis cpn10 plays an important role during infection.11 Chaperonin from a thermophilic bacterium, Thermus thermophilus, is stable up to 80°C.12 Here, we report the crystal structure of cpn10 from Thermus thermophilus HB8. In the present structure, the mobile loops were completely disordered in five of the seven subunits, but in the remaining two subunits, the electron density of the mobile loop was partially observed. Materials and Methods. Expression and purification. The gene of the Cpn10 was amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotide primers containing artificial NdeI and BglII site (in bold): 5 -ATATCATATGATCAAGCCCCTAGGAGACCGGGTGGTGG-3 and 5 -ATATAGATCTTTATTACTGCAGGACCGCAAGCAGGTCGCGC©

3 . The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and was ligated into pET-11a expression plasmid (Novagen), in which Cpn10 gene is under the control of the T7 promoter. This recombinant plasmid was transformed into E.coli strain BL21(DE3). Cells were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 g/mL ampicillin, and then were harvested and sonicated in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl. The crude extract was incubated at 70°C for 10 min, cooled on ice, and ultracentrifuged at 200,000 g for 60 min. The supernatant was purified by six steps of column chromatography, using Resource ISO, Resource Q, Hydroxyapatite CHT2, Mono Q, HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 and HiPrep 26/10 desalting columns. The purified Cpn10 was concentrated to 25 mg/mL by ultrafiltration membrane in solutions of 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mM dithiothreitol, and stored at 4°C. Crystallization, data collection, and structure determination. The crystallization was performed by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method at 20°C. Reservoir solutions containing 100 mM MES (pH 6.0), 43% (v/v) PEG 300, and 50 mM potassium chloride were mixed with protein solutions in a 1:1 ratio. Crystals appeared after one week. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the BL41XU beamline at SPring-8. The crystals were flash-frozen in a nitrogen gas stream at 183°C. The crystals diffracted X-rays up to 2.9 ° A resolution. Crystals belong to the space group I4122 with ° ° unit cell dimensions of a b 192.88 A, and c 109.66 A. An asymmetric unit contained one heptamer of Cpn10 ° with a Matthews coefficient of 3.54 A3 Da 1. The collected diffraction data were processed with the HKL2000 package.13 The initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement with AMORE14 using the cpn10 heptamer

from M. tuberculosis (PDB code: 1HX5) as a search model. Several cycles of manual model rebuilding and model refinement were performed by using O15 and CNS,16 respectively. A total of 545 amino acid residues were included in the final model, in which the R and Rfree values were 25.3 and 27.5%, respectively. The evaluation of the quality of the model was performed with PROCHECK.17,18 The statistics for data collection and refinement are summarized in Table I. Results and Discussion. The overall structure of the cpn10 from T. thermophilus was similar to other cpn10s the crystal structures of which have previously been reported [Fig. 1(A, B)]. The structure was composed of a dome-shaped homo-heptamer, as anticipated, since the amino acid sequences are highly conserved. In five of the monomers (chains A, B, D, E, and F) of the present structure, the electron densities of the mobile loops (Glu15 to Lys33) were disordered; Met1 to Ile14, and Pro34 to Gln94 were included in our model. On the other hand, in the remaining two monomers (chains C and G), the electron densities of the mobile loops were partially observed. Met1-Ile14 and Val25-Gln94 and Met1-Val25 and Pro34-Gln94 were included in the model for chains C and G, respectively. These two mobile loops were in contact with the neighboring mobile loop in the crystal. Chains C ° and G were superimposed with RMS deviations of 0.56 A (76 C atoms) as shown in Fig. 1(C), indicate the putative mobile loop model of our crystal structure. The chains C and G of our model were superimposed on the corresponding Cpn10 chains from E. coli (chain U) and ° M. tuberculosis (chain G), with RMS deviations of 0.83 A ° (66 C atoms) and 0.88 A (67 C atoms), respectively to chain G of T. thermophilus [Fig. 1(C)].

regions were residues at positions 15 to 34 (mobile loop), 48 to 52 and 68 to 70. The mobile loops of the Cpn10 structures from the three species examined completely differed from each other. It has been shown that the -hairpin conformation of the mobile loop in solution GroES alone does not remarkably change the conformation of the GroEL-GroES complex in its crystal structure, as determined by SAXS experiments.19 The three crystal structures shown in Fig.1(C) indicate the range of mobility of the mobile loop of cpn10 in solution, wherein the -hairpin structure was maintained without GroEL binding.
