The structure of the N-terminal docking and dimerization domain of the type IIa regulatory subunit (RIIa D/D) of protein kinase A (PKA) forms a noncovalent stand-alone X-type four-helix bundle structural motif, consisting of two helix-loop-helix monomers. RIIa D/D possesses a strong hydrophobic core and two distinct, exposed faces. A hydrophobic face with a groove is the site of protein≠protein interactions necessary for subcellular localization. A highly charged face, opposite to the former, may be involved in regulation of protein≠protein interactions as a result of changes in phosphorylation state of the regulatory subunit. Although recent studies have addressed the hydrophobic character of packing of RIIa D/D and revealed the function of the hydrophobic face as the binding site to A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), little attention has been paid to the charges involved in structure and function. To examine the electrostatic character of the structure of RIIa D/D we have predicted mean apparent pKa values, based on Poisson≠Boltzmann electrostatic calculations, using an ensemble of calculated dimer structures. We propose that the

helix promoting sequence Glu34-X-X-X-Arg38 stabilizes the second helix of each monomer, through the formation of a (i, i +4) side chain salt bridge. We show that a weak interhelical hydrogen bond between Tyr35≠Glu19 of each monomer contributes to tertiary packing and may be responsible for discriminating from alternative quaternary packing of the two monomers. We also show that an intermonomer hydrogen bond between Asp30≠Arg40 contributes to quaternary packing. We propose that the charged face comprising of Asp27-Asp30-Glu34-Arg38-Arg40Glu41-Arg43-Arg44 may be necessary to provide flexibility or stability in the region between the C-terminus and the interdomain/autoinhibitory sequence of RIIa, depending on the activation state of PKA. We also discuss the structural requirements necessary for the formation of a stacked (rather than intertwined) dimer, which has consequences for the orientation of the functionally important and distinct faces. 1 Keywords: PKA; AKAP; NMR; dimer; pKa.

Protein phosphorylation controls many cellular processes including carbohydrate metabolism, muscle contraction, lymphocyte activation, secretion and cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Activation of protein kinases and phosphatases is an integral component in the signaling pathways that mediate these cellular processes. This activation is triggered by specific hormones with the aid of second messengers, including Ca2+, phospholipids, or cAMP. In turn, protein kinases or protein phosphatases alter the phosphorylation state of specific subcellular targets [1]. Because many protein kinases are of broad specificity, a key question has been how these enzymes mediate specific

events in the appropriate time frame. It is now apparent that subcellular localization of kinases near their preferred targets affords this control. This localization and selective phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of protein targets in the cell are mediated by specific protein≠protein interactions [2,3]. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is tethered to specific subcellular compartments by A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). The site of interaction with AKAPs is the N-terminal docking and dimerization (D/D) domain of the regulatory (R) subunit of PKA. While early studies indicated that only the type IIa regulatory subunits are targeted, the recent discovery of dual-specificity AKAPs (D-AKAPs) indicates that the type I enzyme may also be localized [4]. The N-terminal dimerization domain of the Type IIa regulatory subunit of PKA, called hereafter RIIa D/D, possesses two solvent exposed faces with distinct structural properties. One face is highly hydrophobic with a wellunderstood function as the AKAP binding site [5,6]. The other face is highly charged and has not been the subject of detailed study. The hydrophobic and charged faces of the RIIa D/D are diametrically opposed to each other. Interestingly, phosphorylation of RIIa by the cyclin B-p34cdc2 kinase (CDK1) just outside the D/D alters the subcellular localization of RIIa at the onset of mitosis [7]. Thus, the electrostatic environment influences the affinity of

RIIa for its anchoring partner, suggesting communication between the diametrically opposed functional faces. To examine the electrostatic properties of RIIa D/D, we have applied a Poisson≠Boltzmann continuum electrostatics method on an ensemble of calculated solution structures, which has led to prediction of mean apparent pKa values of all ionizable residues of RIIa D/D. The use of the ensemble of NMR structures is more suitable for the calculation because it provides us with a range of pKa values, from structures that comply with the permitted conformational space, but allow for flexibility as indicated by their rmsd. We have used a two-step molecular dynamics/simulated annealing protocol with NMR restraints, to determine the ensemble of structures of RIIa D/D. Initial monomer RIIa D/D structures were calculated using a subset of NOEs determined to be unambiguous intra-monomer NOEs. Subsequently, the coordinates of the monomer structures were used as starting structures for the dimer calculations, using the complete set of available NOEs. This protocol allows for the investigation of the role of electrostatics in guiding the optimum relative topology of the two monomers of the dimer. Using the pKa values and structural arguments, we have determined the role of charges in interactions associated with secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure packing and stability. In addition, we discuss the role of charges in function of RIIa D/D.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample preparation and NMR spectroscopy Sample preparations and the types of experiments and conditions used have been described previously [5,6,8]. The sample pH was 4. Conversion of NMR parameters to structural restraints Spectral processing, cross peak picking and volume integrations were performed using the program FELIX 95 (Molecular Simulations). NOE volumes were measured using the 2D 1H-1H NOESY (sm º 100 and 200 ms), 3D 1 H-15N NOESY-HSQC (sm º 150 ms), 3D 1H-13C HMQC-NOESY (sm º 150 ms), and 3D 13C-edited (x2), 12 C-filtered (x1)/13C-filtered (x3) NOESY (sm º 150 ms), collected at 25 ∞C [5,8]. The NOE volumes were calibrated using known averaged or fixed distances. Cross peaks in helical segments were used as reference for calibration and ∞ they were Ha-HN (i, i + 3) (3.4 A) for the 2D 1H-1H 1 15 NOESY and the 3D H- N NOESY-HSQC, Ha-Hb ∞ (i, i + 3) (3.4 A) for the 3D 1H-13C HMQC-NOESY and by visual inspection for the 3D 13C-edited (x2)-12C-filtered (x1)/13C-filtered (x3) NOESY. An NOE-derived distance restraint list was generated within the program FELIX 95 using the following classification: strong NOEs ∞ ∞ (1.8 A £ rij £ 2.7 A, where rij is the interproton distance ∞ ∞ between protons i,j), medium NOEs (1.8 A £ rij £ 3.3 A), ∞ ∞ weak NOEs (1.8 A £ rij £ 5.0 A) and very weak NOEs ∞ ∞ (1.8 A £ rij £ 6.0 A). The upper boundary of NOEs ∞ involving amide protons was extended by 0.2 A to account for the higher observed intensity of this type of cross peaks. ∞ In addition, a correction of 0.5 A was added to the upper boundaries of the distances involving methyl groups to account for the averaging of the three methyl protons.

During structure calculations, distances involving nonstereospecifically assigned or degenerate methylene protons and methyl groups were incorporated as (Sr)6))1/6 ‘effective distances’ [9,10]. 3 JHN-Ha-coupling constants were measured from a 3D HNHA spectrum by measuring the intensity ratio of cross peaks to diagonal peaks for resolved 15N-1H pairs. 3JHN-Hacoupling constants were converted to /-dihedral angle restraints as follows: / º )60∞ ± 30∞, for 3 < 3JHN-Ha < 5.5 Hz and presence of sequential NOE connectivities consistent with an a helix, / º )140∞ ± 40∞ for 8 < 3 JHN-Ha < 9 Hz, and / º )140∞ ± 30∞ for 3JHN-Ha > 9 Hz for the b strand/random coil region. A total of 25 /-dihedral angle restraints per monomer were used. Residue Ile5 was assigned to a restraint / º)90∞ ± 90∞, because spectral overlap did not allow an accurate determination of the coupling constant. Side chain v1-dihedral angles for Val18, Val20, Val29, Val33 and Thr37 were restricted to one of the staggered conformations, which was in all cases )60∞ with an associated error of ± 30∞. These values were deduced using the combined information of the intensities of Jab couplings from the 2D DQF-COSY spectrum and the NOE intensities of the HN-Hb and Ha-Hb cross peaks from the 2D and 3D NOESY spectra. A total of 5 v1-dihedral angle restraints per monomer were used. Using the same information stereospecific methyl assignments for the above mentioned valines were made. Intra-monomer backbone hydrogen bond restraints were used in the final stages of the structure calculations for parts of the secondary structure that were well-defined a helices as indicated by the combined information of sequential NOE connectivities Ha-HN (i,i + 1; i,i + 2; i,i + 3; i,i + 4), Ha-Hb (i,i + 3), 3JHN-Ha-coupling constants in the region 3 < 3JHN-Ha < 5.5 Hz and protection from hydrogen exchange [8]. The hydrogen bond restraints were introduced ∞ in the structure calculations as distance restraints of 3.3 A ∞ ∞ ∞ (lower limit 2.5 A, upper limit 3.5 A) for O-N, and 2.3 A ∞ ∞ (lower limit 1.5 A, upper limit 2.5 A) for O-HN. A total of 19 hydrogen bond restraints per monomer were used. Monomer structure calculations The RIIa D/D monomer structures were calculated using the program X-PLOR 3.851 [11]. The hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing and refinement protocol [12] was utilized (DG_SUB_EMBED, DGSA, REFINE, using an initial template random structure with good local geometries and no nonbonded contacts). A total of 457 NOE-derived distance restraints were used (Table 1). The minimization target function during simulated annealing was composed of quadratic harmonic potential terms for covalent geometry (bonds, angles, planes, chirality), quadratic square-well potentials for the experimental distance and dihedral angle restraints, and a quartic van der Waals repulsion term for the nonbonded contacts [11]. No explicit hydrogen bonding, electrostatic or 6≠12 Lennard-Jones potential energy terms were used in the simulated annealing target function. A quadratic distance geometry term was minimized during coordinate regularization [11]. The input force constants for bonds, angles, planes, and chirality ∞ were 1000 kcal∆mol)1∆A)2, 500 kcal∆mol)1∆rad)2, 500 kcal∆ mol)1∆rad)2, 500 kcal∆mol)1∆rad)2, respectively, 4 kcal∆

total of 505 NOE-derived distance restraints were used (Table 1). pKa calculations The method of Antosiewitz et al. [15,16], implemented within the program UHBD [17,18] was used for the calculations of pKa values of the NMR ensemble of structures of RIIa D/D. Poisson≠Boltzmann continuum electrostatic calculations were performed to calculate electrostatic potentials, which were used for determination of differences in the ionization free energy (DDG) of the charged and neutral forms of each ionizable site in the protein and free in solution. Then, intrinsic pKa values of each ionizable site were computed using DDG values and experimental model pKa values, as described in Antosiewitz et al. [15]. Apparent pKa values for each ionizable site of RIIa D/D were calculated, taking into account interactions among all ionizable sites in their ionized states, using the ‘clustering’ method of Gilson [19]. Finally, mean pKa values and their rmsds were calculated using the 24 NMR structures of our final ensemble of dimer structures of RIIa D/D. Dielectric smoothing at the protein≠solvent interface [20,21] was used, with an ion exclusion layer around the ∞ protein defined by a probe of 2.0-A radius. Finite difference focusing methods [22,23] were used in the calculations, with ∞ focusing grids of 2.5, 1.25, 0.5, and 0.25 A. The parameter set of charges and van der Waals radii PARSE [24], dielectric constants of 78.4 and 20.0, for solvent and protein, respectively, temperature of 298 K, and ionic strength corresponding to 100 mM were used. Justification for the relatively high value of the protein dielectric constant is discussed in Antosiewitz et al. [15,16]. Changes from the neutral to charged ionization state, were made by adding a ± 1 charge to each ionizable site, depending on their charge. Negative unit charges were added at the following atoms: Ct of the C-terminus, Cc of Asp and Cd of Glu, and Og of Tyr. Positive unit charges were added at the following atoms: Nt of the N-terminus, Nf of Lys, Cf of Arg, and Nd or Ne of His (depending on the position of the initial hydrogen in the neutral form). The initial protonation and flip state of His, and flip state of Asn and Gln residues, was established using the global hydrogen bonding network optimization option of the program WHAT IF vs. 99 [25,26]. Addition of hydrogens to establish the neutral state of Asp and Glu residues, at the Od2 and Oe2 atoms, respectively, was made using a special version of WHAT IF provided to us by J. E. Nielsen & G. Vriend (EMBL and University of 2 Nijmegen). The experimental model pKa values used were: 12.0 for Arg, 10.4 for Lys, 9.6 for Tyr, 6.3 for His, 4.4 for Glu, 4.0 for Asp, 7.5 for the N-terminus, and 3.8 for C-terminus. Structure validations and molecular graphics Structures were visually inspected using the program MOLMOL [27]. The programs PROCHECK-NMR [28] and WHAT IF [26] were used for structure validation. The program MOLMOL [27] was used for secondary structure evaluation, solvent accessibility calculation, angular order parameters calculation, inter-helical angle calculation, and for protein structure figure preparation.

Force constants were varied during the structure calculations according to the standard X-PLOR protocols [11]. Dimer structure calculations The RIIa D/D dimer structures were calculated using the program X-PLOR and a protocol developed by the group of M. Nilges (MDSA-SO-WDMR-1.0) [13,14]. The dynamic NOE assignment method of Nilges [10] was used to calculate an ‘effective distance’ comprising of the sum of the intra- and inter- monomer distances [(Sr)6))1/6 averaging per monomer]. The initial structures were the accepted monomer structures. The minimization target function potential terms for covalent geometry, van der Waals repulsion, experimental intra-residue NOEs and dihedral angles were the same as in the monomer calculation. In addition soft-square potential terms were used for experimental inter-monomer and ambiguous NOEs, a symmetry soft-square potential term was used for global symmetry NOEs, a quadratic harmonic potential term was used for noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints and a quadratic harmonic potential term was used for packing to prevent monomers from drifting apart. The input force constants were as in the monomer calculation for covalent geometry terms, the van der Waals repulsion term and the experimental dihedral angle ∞ term. The input force constants were 50 kcal∆mol)1∆A)2 for intra-monomer, inter-monomer, and ambiguous NOEs, ∞ ∞ 2 kcal∆mol)1∆A)2 for symmetry NOEs, 2 kcal∆mol)1∆A)2 for ∞ NCS restraints, and 0.3 ∑ 10)6 kcal∆mol)1∆A)2 for packing.

RESULTS
A total of 100 monomer structures of RIIa D/D were generated from a subset of our NMR NOE assignments, which were classified as unambiguous. From these initial calculations 49 monomer structures with no NOE violation ∞ > 0.3 A, no dihedral angle violation > 5∞, no bond ∞ violation > 0.05 A, no angle violation > 5∞ and no improper angle violation > 5∞ were accepted, and used in subsequent dimer structure calculations. The total energies and the rmsds from the lowest energy structure of the 49 resulting dimer structures are plotted in increasing total energy value in Fig. 1. Dimer structures that showed NOE ∞ violations > 0.3 A and/or dihedral angle violations > 5∞ are represented with open symbols in the plot. Most structures (41 out of 49; Fig. 1) with total energies 160≠770 kcal∆mol)1 and small rmsds from the lowest energy structure, converged to the same structural motif. This motif comprises two helix-turn-helix monomers packed in an antiparallel arrangement in a four-helix bundle with both helices (I and II) of monomer 1 on top of the respective helices (I¢ and II¢) of monomer 2. We call this stacked packing arrangement a top-top structure. A few structures (5 out of 49) with high total energy terms (890≠2000 kcal∆mol)1), larger rmsds from the lowest energy structure, and with several NOE viola-

∞ ∞ tions > 0.3 A (up to 1 A) have also been identified (Fig. 1). These structures possess a topology where helices I and II of monomer 1, and helices I¢ and II¢ of monomer 2, are intertwined. We call this a top-bottom structure. The inset of Fig. 1 shows a cylinder model of the lowest total energy structures of each of the two structural motifs, top-top and top-bottom. Both structural motifs pack into an X-type four-helix bundle, the difference between the two is the relative topology of the four helices. In addition, three illdefined structures, different from each other, with the highest total energies (3900≠8300 kcal∆mol)1) and the highest rmsds from the lowest energy structure were found (Fig. 1). These structures had several severe NOE violations ∞ ∞ > 0.3 A (up to 1.6 A) and/or dihedral angle violations > 5∞ (up to 11∞). As the small ensemble of top-bottom structures and the three ill-defined structures suffer from significant experimental NOE or NOE and dihedral angle violations, we continued our analysis using the large ensemble of the top-top structures. Indeed we selected a subset of structures from the top-top ensemble (24 out of 41 structures) because some of the higher energy top-top structures also exhibited ∞ ∞ small NOE violations > 0.3 A (up to 0.6 A). The selected 24 structures form a continuous ensemble of lowest energy structures (in increasing energy value) that does not include any structure with restraint violations according to the criteria mentioned above (Fig. 1). This final ensemble, with cutoff total energy value at 240 kcal∆mol)1, comprising the 24 best RIIa D/D structures was used for further analysis (Fig. 1). A superposition of the backbone of the final ensemble of 24 structures of RIIa D/D is shown in Fig. 2. The RIIa D/D homodimer consists of an antiparallel packing of the two subunits and possesses C2 symmetry. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the structural statistics of the ensemble of 24 structures, the lowest energy and the best (smaller rmsd from the mean) structure of RIIa D/D. Each monomer of RIIa D/D consists of a disordered N-terminal segment

Fig. 1. Total energy plot of the 49 calculated dimer RIIa D/D structures. The structures are numbered in increasing energy order (black symbols). Forty-one structures conform with the top-top configuration (squares), five structures conform with the top-bottom configuration (circles) and three structures assume three different ill-defined configurations (∑). Structures without NOE or dihedral angle violation are represented with solid symbols. Structures represented with open ∞ ∞ symbols possess NOE violations greater than 0.3 A up to 1.6 A. Structures #47 and #48 possess dihedral angle violations greater than 5∞ up to 11∞. The vertical dashed line corresponds to the cutoff energy for the selection of the final ensemble of 24 structures with lowest energy and no NOE or dihedral angle violation (see text). Symbols drawn in grey represent the rmsd of each structure from the lowest energy structure (structure #1). The rmsds from the lowest energy structure are calculated by fitting the backbone atoms (N, Ca, C¢) of residues 9≠41. The inset shows a cylinder representation of the relative topology of the two different families of structures, top-top and topbottom, found in the 49 calculated dimer structures of RIIa D/D. All top-bottom structures have significant NOE violations. The inset was generated using the program MOLMOL [27].

The secondary structure of RIIa D/D was determined from the coordinates of the ensemble of 24 structures using the program MOLMOL [27]. For both helices I (I¢) and II (II¢) the beginning of the helices is well defined but the end of the helices shows some variation. Helix I (I¢) begins at residue 9 and ends at residues 20≠23 in the various structures of the ensemble. A weighted average positioned the C-terminus of helix I (I¢) at residue 22. Helix II (II¢) starts at residue 28 and ends at residues 39≠ 43 in the various structures of the ensemble. A weighted average positioned the C-terminus of helix II (II¢) at residue 41. Thus all helices are well defined in their centers with some fraying at their C-termini. Analysis of the final ensemble of 24 structures of RIIa D/D with PROCHECK-NMR [28] reveals that 71.7% of

residues are found in the most favored region, 25.1% in additionally allowed region, 3.1% in the generously allowed region and 0.1% in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Similar analysis using only the best defined region (residues 9≠41, Table 3) of the final ensemble of the 24 structures of RIIa D/D shows that 82.8% of residues are found in the most favored region, 15.8% in the additionally allowed region, 1.4% in the generously allowed region and 0.0% in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The inter-helical angles in the ensemble of the RIIa D/D structures are typical for an X-type four-helix bundle. Specifically, the angle between helices I, I¢ is 162∞ ± 7∞, between II, II¢ is 146∞ ± 5∞, between I, II (I¢, II¢) is 127∞ ± 6∞, and between I, II¢ (I¢, II) is 46∞ ± 5∞. (Interhelical angle of 0∞ was assigned to parallel N-C helix vectors.) The structures of RIIa D/D presented here and calculated using initial structures of reasonably well-defined monomers, are in excellent agreement with calculated structures of RIIa D/D using initial structures with random /-, w-angles [5]. A summary of the various classes of NOEs is presented in Fig. 3A, the number of the different types of NOEs per residue are categorized as intra-monomer and inter-monomer. The intra-monomer NOEs are further classified as intra-residue, short range sequential, medium range sequential and long range. The per-residue rmsd of the backbone heavy atoms (N, Ca, C¢) and all heavy atoms is shown in Fig. 3B. Figure 3C≠E shows the calculated angular order parameters [29] for backbone /-, w-, and side chain v1-dihedral angles, using the ensemble of 24 structures of RIIa D/D. From Fig. 3, the flexibility is apparent for the amino terminal segment, )1 to 8, the C-terminal segment, 42≠44, and, to a lesser extent, of the loop segment, 23≠27, and the C-terminus of helices I, I¢ (residues 21≠22) and II, II¢ (residue 41). These flexible segments also show lower densities of NOEs per residue, as expected. In addition, Fig. 3F shows the calculated percent solvent accessibility [30] of the best dimer structure of RIIa D/D, and it is compared to the percent solvent accessibility of one of the monomers in the best structure of RIIa D/D. Residues Gln4, Ile5, Pro6, Leu9, Leu12, Leu13, Tyr16, Thr17, Val20, Leu21, Gln24, Leu28, Val29, Asp30, Ala32, Val33, Phe36, Thr37, Leu39, and Arg40 show variable changes in solvent accessibility upon dimer formation, which is consistent with the structural characteristics of RIIa D/D. Most of these residues are in helices I (I¢), II (II¢), with the exception of Gln4 at the end of the disordered N-terminus, Ile5, Pro6 which are part of the first turn [8] and residues Gln24, Asp27 which are part of the second turn of RIIa D/D. Figure 4 summarizes the structural characteristics of RIIa D/D using the final ensemble of 24 structures and the best structure.

Only side chains with hydrophobic character in the region 9≠41 are shown, and they are Leu9,12,13,21,28,39, Val18,20,29,33, Phe31,36, Tyr16,35, Thr10,17,37. The RIIa D/D possesses a wellformed hydrophobic core between the two monomers, which contributes to the stability and packing of the dimer. Parallel packing of the aromatic side chains Tyr16, Phe31, Tyr35 and Phe36 and contacts involving the side chains of Leu12, Val20, Leu28, Val29, Val33, Thr37 and Leu39, are observed in the hydrophobic core (Fig. 4A).

hydrophobic groove between helices I and I¢, partially exposed but with the hydrophobic side chains of Leu9, Leu13, Val18, Leu21 and Thr10, Thr17, packing against each other, is formed outside the protein core. This hydrophobic groove has been identified as the site of interaction with AKAP proteins [5,6]. The symmetry axis of the dimer is along the y-axis shown in the Figure. Figure 4B shows the van der Waals model of the top face of the best structure of RIIa D/D in the region )1 to 44. This view is generated by rotating the orientation of RIIa D/D of Fig. 4A by 90∞ about the x-axis (Fig. 4). This view depicts the partially exposed hydrophobic character of the top face of RIIa D/D (the colouring scheme is the same as in Fig. 4A). Interaction of RIIa D/D with AKAP proteins occurs along the hydrophobic interface of the two monomers (Fig. 6B). A further rotation of the orientation of RIIa D/D of Fig. 4B by 180∞ about the x-axis shows the bottom face of RIIa D/D (Fig. 4C). There is some hydrophobic character in the bottom face of RIIa D/D at the monomer interface, which is part of the protein core. Figure 4D≠F shows the ribbon model of the best structure of RIIa D/D in the same orientations as their corresponding left (Fig. 4A≠C) and right (Fig. 4G≠I) panels. The top (Fig. 4E) and bottom (Fig. 4F) views demonstrate that RIIa D/D forms a typical X-type four-helix bundle structural motif. Figure 4G shows the backbone and the charged side chains of the final ensemble of 24 structures of RIIa D/D. All positively charged side chains [Arg22,38,40,43,44, His()1),2] are depicted in blue and all negatively charged side chains (Asp27,30, Glu11,19,34,41) are depicted in red. Figure 4H shows the top face (same as in Fig. 4B,E) of a van der Waals model of the best structure of RIIa D/D. This face is free of charged residues around the interface of the monomers which has been shown to be highly hydrophobic (Fig. 4B), with the exception of Glu11. However, the disordered parts of this face (N- and C-termini) demonstrate the presence of positive charge. Figure 4I shows the bottom face (same as in Fig. 4C) of a

van der Waals model of the best structure of RIIa D/D. The central part of this face appears to be highly charged with the presence of both negatively and positively charged residues, symmetrically arranged. Additionally, the disordered N- and C-termini appear to be positively charged. In our effort to understand the structural properties of the charged face, we have performed pKa calculations on the ensemble of 24 structures of RIIa D/D. Figure 5 presents a plot of the calculated apparent mean pKa value per residue and compares them to the model pKa values of each ionizable site. In addition, Fig. 5 shows the secondary structure of RIIa D/D to aid the analysis. Calculations were performed using the dimer form of RIIa D/D, and the pairs of data points in Fig. 5 correspond to the two monomers. Finally, the error bars reflect the rmsd from the mean pKa value. Examination of Fig. 5 reveals that residues located in regions of flexibility (N- and C-termini and inter-helical loop; Fig. 3) tend to have mean pKa values close to their model pKa value and with small pKa rmsd. This is the case for the N-terminus (7.1 ± 0.5), His2 (5.9 ± 0.4), Asp27 (3.4 ± 0.3), Glu41 (4.5 ± 0.3), Arg43 (12.8 ± 0.3), Arg44 (12.7 ± 0.2), and the C-terminus (3.5 ± 0.3), and for residue Arg22 (12.5 ± 0.1), which is located in a welldefined region at the C-terminus of helices I, I¢. There is one exception His()1) which shows a significantly lower mean pKa value (5.1 ± 0.7) with large variation. This may be attributed to proximity with two basic sites, the N-terminal amide and His2. Aspartic acids Asp27 and Asp30 show lower mean pKa values than their model pKa values. This may be a general property of Asp residues, as it has been observed in another study of NMR ensembles of structures [16]. Mean pKa values of glutamic acids, Glu11 (3.9 ± 0.2) and Glu34 (4.6 ± 0.4), show a small deviation from their model pKa values and with small variation. However, Glu19 shows an increased mean pKa value of 5.0 ± 0.4), but with a small variation. Both tyrosines show significantly upshifted mean pKa values from their model pKa values with large variations. Indeed the largest shift and variation is observed

Fig. 5. Plot of the calculated apparent mean pKa values of ionizable residues of RIIa D/D against the residue number. The model pKa of each ionizable residue is represented by black open squares. The mean value of the calculated apparent pKa for each ionizable residue of the ensemble of 24 structures of RIIa D/D, is represented by pairs of grey open circles. The left open circle in each pair corresponds to monomer 1, and right open circle in each pair corresponds to monomer 2. The error bars correspond to root mean square deviations from the mean pKa value. The arrows depict interactions discussed in text, as follows: intra-helical Arg38≠Glu34, inter-helical Tyr35≠Glu19, and intermonomer Arg40≠Asp30, and desolvated Tyr16. Note that the studied sample of RIIa D/D contains residues His()1) and Met0, which have been intorduced by the protein expression system used. Residue )2 in the plot corresponds to the amino terminal ionizable group of His()1), and residue 45 corresponds to the C-terminal ionizable group of Arg44. The types of ionizable sites corresponding to the model pKa values are marked on the right hand side of the Figure. The secondary structure of RIIa D/D is shown at the bottom of the figure, with helices depicted as elongated rectangles. Secondary structure has been determined as discussed in text, and the error bar at the C-terminus of each helix corresponds to the variable helical range within the ensemble of the 24 structures. There is no variation at amino terminus of each helix. The sequence of ionizable sites of RIIa D/D is: Nter-His()1)-His2Glu11-Tyr16-Glu19-Arg22-Asp27-Asp30-Glu34-Tyr35-Arg38-Arg40Glu41-Arg43-Arg44-Cter.

the donor and acceptor atoms and their relative orientation, but also the observation of unusual pKa values attributed to side chain interactions. A dynamic character of the two side chains should also be considered. The favorable Coulombic interaction of Arg38 with Glu34 within the same monomer and same helix (II or II¢), contributes to the high pKa value of Arg38. The distances between the ionizable sites of Arg38≠Glu34 are character∞ istic of the presence of salt bridges (< 5 A in 13 structures, ∞ and < 6 A in 17 structures). In addition, favorable inter-monomer Coulombic interaction of Arg40≠Asp30 contributes to the high pKa values of Arg40 and the low pKa value of Asp30. The smallest inter-monomer distance between an Arg40 hydrogen donor site (He, Hg11, Hg12, Hg21, Hg22) and an Asp30 acceptor site ∞ (Od1, Od2) is 3.3 ± 1.6 A using the ensemble of 24 lowest ∞ energy structures, 3.1 ± 1.2 A using the ensemble of the 23 ∞ lowest energy structures, or 2.1 A using the lowest energy structure of RIIa D/D. (It appears that the 24th lowest energy structure contains a statistical outlier for this particular distance.) These distances are characteristic of an inter-monomer hydrogen bond. Also, an inter-monomer weak salt bridge between Arg40 and Asp27 cannot be excluded, as the smallest inter-monomer distance between a Arg40 hydrogen donor site and an Asp27 acceptor site is ∞ < 6 A in eight out of the 24 lowest energy structures.

DISCUSSION
A four-helix bundle is a common structural motif, which is mainly found as a part of a larger folding unit and, to a lesser extent, as a stand-alone bundle. Several categories of four-helix bundles have been identified, depending on the topology of the four helices, the inter-helical angles and inter-helical distances. RIIa D/D forms a dimeric X-type four-helix bundle with an alternating pattern of nearly antiparallel and nearly orthogonal helix≠helix interactions at the dimer interface [31]. We have shown that a finer classification of quaternary structure for dimeric X-type four-helix bundles involves the relative monomer topology. In RIIa D/D the two monomers are packed in a stacked as opposed to an intertwined configuration. Another example of dimeric stand-alone X-type four-helix bundle with symmetry similar to RIIa D/D is the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a (HNF-1a) [32]; however, the two monomers of HNF-1a are packed into an intertwined configuration. The intertwined monomer packing has also been observed in the de novo synthetic four-helix bundle dimeric protein a2D [33]; however, the symmetry of a2D was broken by the introduction of asymmetric mutations. The authors of this study have called the a2D packing ‘bisecting U’, and have attributed it to the asymmetric inter-helical contacts. In the case of gene regulating protein Arc repressor [34], which forms a stand-alone dimeric four-helix bundle, but with symmetry different from RIIa D/D, a stacked monomer configuration is also formed. As shown in Fig. 4, dimerization of RIIa D/D is maintained by strong hydrophobic interactions of side chains that form the core of the protein at the dimer interface. The formation of a clustering of side chains within the same monomer and between monomers constitutes the protein hydrophobic core (see Results section; Fig. 4A). The close contacts of Leu13(I)-Leu13(I¢) and Phe36(II)-Phe36(II¢)

for Tyr16 (13.7 ± 0.6). Residue Tyr35 is the only one that shows variation within the two monomers (11.6 ± 0.6 for monomer 1 and 11.5 ± 0.4 for monomer 2; Fig. 5). Finally, the mean pKa values of residues Arg38 and Arg40, located in the structured region of the charged face, are 13.6 ± 0.3 and 14.2 ± 0.5, respectively. After examining the NMR structures, we can attribute the upshifted mean pKa of Tyr16 to desolvation, as there is ∞ no other ionizable site within 5 A of the Og atom of Tyr16. Tyr16 has < 10% solvent accessibility (Fig. 3F) and is surrounded by residues Gln23, Leu28, Phe31, Phe36 of the same monomer, and Leu9, Leu12, and Leu13 of the other monomer, all but one of them being hydrophobic. Unfavorable intra-monomer Coulombic interaction between Tyr35 and Glu19 (of the same monomer) explains the upshifted pKa values of both residues. The distance between Tyr35 (Og) and Glu19 (smallest distance to Oe1 or ∞ Oe2) is 3.6 ± 0.7 A for the ensemble of structures, and ∞ 2.5 A for the lowest energy structure, which is suggestive of a weak hydrogen bond. The definition of hydrogen bond here is broader and includes not only the distance between

along the symmetry axis of the dimer, bring together helices I, I¢ and II, II¢, respectively (Fig. 5A), and they are critical for dimerization. This is in agreement with earlier studies where mutations at Leu13 and Phe36 of RIIb abolish both dimerization and AKAP interaction [35]. This observation supports the hypothesis that noncovalent interactions are sufficient to maintain dimerization. In RIIa there are no disulfide bonds at the dimer interface, as is the case for the RI isoforms [36]. Sequence alignment of the RIa, RIb, RIIa and RIIb isoforms reveals the conservation of the strong hydrophobic core, which is essential for the stability of the dimer. It has been pointed out before [16] that use of NMR structures produce pKa values with values closer to their experimentally measured pKa values, when compared with the use of crystallographic structures. These conclusions were reached by performing pKa calculations on four different proteins with both NMR and crystallographic structures available [16]. In the absence of crystallographic structures of RIIa D/D, we cannot draw similar conclusions. However, we can argue that the availability of an ensemble of NMR structures that agrees with the allowed conformational space without violating the experimentally established restraints, provides a more realistic range of pKa values within the calculated rmsd, centered around a mean pKa. We have performed mean pKa calculations to assess the involvement of specific electrostatic interactions in stability and packing of RIIa D/D. We have attributed the unusual pKa shifts of Tyr16, Glu19, Tyr35, Arg38, and Arg40 to Coulombic interactions and desolvation. We have also distinguished side chain interactions that contribute to (a) stability of secondary structure (intra-helical), (b) packing of tertiary structure (intra-monomer, inter-helical), and (c) packing of quaternary structure (inter-monomer, interhelical). Intra-helical favorable Coulombic interaction between side chains of Glu34≠Arg38 stabilizes the core of each of helices II and II¢ through a salt bridge (Fig. 6A). This is in agreement with the fact that the sequence Glu-X-X-X-Arg is a typical helix promoting sequence through ion pair interactions in peptides [37≠39]. We do not observe a similar electrostatic interaction contributing to the stability of helices I and I¢. A contribution to the inter-helical packing within each monomer is provided by the interaction between Tyr35 (helix II, II¢)-Glu19 (helix I, I¢, close to C-terminus), which is suggestive of a weak intra-monomer and inter-helical hydrogen bond (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, this hydrogen bond is not observed in the rejected top-bottom structures. It is possible that the inter-helical contact of Tyr35 and Glu19 is an essential condition for the distinction of the stacked toptop vs. the intertwined top-bottom relative monomer topology. It is also possible that in X-type four helix bundles where the tertiary and quaternary packing is exclusively hydrophobic, without the presence of an interhelical hydrogen bond, an intertwined top-bottom monomer arrangement may be more favorable. In the case of the symmetric homodimer HNF-1a structure, which consists of intertwined monomers, interhelical interactions between a residue close to the C-terminus of helix I (I¢) and a residue in the middle of helix II (II¢), is absent. The transcription regulation protein ROP forms a dimeric stand-alone four-helix bundle with

all-antiparallel helix geometry and stacked monomer configuration [40]. Introduction of a single Ala to Pro mutation in the inter-helical loop of each monomer in ROP is sufficient to change the quaternary structure to an intertwined monomer configuration [41]. Also, excision of the inter-helical loop results to a totally different packing and oligomerization state [42]. It is possible that the stability of the inter-helical loop in RIIa D/D is a crucial factor in discriminating the packed from the intertwined monomer arrangement. The Tyr35≠Glu19 inter-helical interaction may be contributing in the conformational state of the interhelical loop in RIIa D/D. It is possible that the alternative packing observed on the ensemble of the five rejected top-bottom structures of RIIa D/D occurs because of differences in the conformation of

the loop connecting helices I and II (I¢ and II¢). Figure 7A shows a superposition of the lowest energy structures from the ensembles of the 24 accepted top-top structures and the five rejected top-bottom structures, respectively. The conformations of the inter-helical loop differ significantly in the two structures. Figure 7B,C shows superpositions of the 24 top-top and the five top-bottom structures, respectively, depicting loop residues Gln23, Gln24, Pro25, Pro26, Asp27, and selected hydrophobic residues that show significant conformational differences in the two ensembles. The backbone torsion angles of Gln24 and the side chain torsion

angles of both Gln23 and Gln24 are significantly different in the two ensembles, while the remaining three residues of the loop do not show conformational differences. If interactions between helices and turns are important for quaternary packing, these loop differences can explain the variation in the packing of the two ensembles. The inter-helical angle between I-II (I¢-II¢) is smaller in the top-bottom ensemble, while the inter-helical angles between I-I¢ and II-II¢ are larger in the top-bottom ensemble (values: 118∞ ± 10∞, 127∞ ± 6∞ for I-II; 170∞ ± 4∞, 162∞ ± 7∞ for I-I¢; 159∞ ± 7∞, 146∞ ± 5∞ for II-II¢, where the first value corresponds to the top-bottom and the second value to the top-top ensemble). These differences are associated with a tighter hydrophobic packing in a congested smaller core in the top-bottom structures, which has resulted in a different packing of the hydrophobic side chains (especially of Leu9, Leu12, Leu13, Leu21, and Tyr35; Fig. 7B,C) and in the observed experimental restraint violations. It is worth noting the switch of Leu13 from being part of the exposed hydrophobic groove in the top-top structures to becoming part of the hydrophobic core in the top-bottom structures and assuming the role of neighboring Leu12 in participating in the formation of the hydrophobic core (Fig. 7B,C). In addition, the calculated percent solvent accessibility for loop residues Gln23 and Gln24 using the ordered region between residues 11≠43, is significantly reduced in the top-bottom compared to the top-top ensemble, contributing to energetically less favorable conformations of the polar side chains of Gln23 and Gln24 in the top-bottom compared to the toptop structure. These observations, together with the experimental restraint violations, suggest that the top-bottom structure would be of lower stability and therefore is not found in the native protein. It would be interesting to see if mutating residues in the loop region would affect quaternary packing, as is the case for ROP [41]. Ongoing work will address this question. We have pointed out above the presence of hydrophobic contacts between helices I, I¢ and II, II¢, which are important for packing and dimerization. The antiparallel arrangement of the NH-CO vectors of helices I, I¢ or II, II¢, is an optimal alignment for the helix dipoles. This alignment gives some electrostatic character in the otherwise hydrophobic packing and stability of helices I, I¢. Additional quaternary packing interactions of electrostatic character are the observed favorable inter-monomer Coulombic interactions between Arg40 of helix II (II¢) of one monomer with Asp30 of helix II¢ (II) of the other monomer. The Arg40≠Asp30 interaction is suggestive of the presence of an inter-monomer hydrogen bond. Finally, the very high pKa value of Tyr16 can only be attributed to a highly desolvated environment, contributed by hydrophobic residues from both monomers. The role that Tyr16 plays in the structure of RIIa D/D is not yet understood. RIIa D/D possesses two diametrically opposed functional faces, one highly hydrophobic (top face, Fig. 4A,B) and one highly charged (bottom face, Fig. 4G,I), located at exactly opposite directions. The N-terminal face contains a highly hydrophobic groove (Fig. 4B) along the solvent exposed part of the interface of helices I, I¢ (Fig. 4A). This is an unusual but very significant characteristic of RIIa D/D, which promotes participation in protein≠protein interactions and in mediating intracellular signal transduction events. The hydrophobic side chains of this groove cluster

against each other and they are clearly independent from the protein hydrophobic core. The exposed hydrophobic groove is the binding site of the amphipathic AKAP peptides through their hydrophobic face. This observation is supported by structure determination of the complex RIIa D/D with AKAP peptides Ht31(493≠515) and AKAP79(392≠ 413) [6] and with a peptide docking model [5], which showed the alignment of the exposed hydrophobic groove of RIIa D/D with the hydrophobic surface of the AKAP peptides. The C-terminal face is a highly charged surface with symmetrically arranged charged residues. The charged face of RIIa D/D contains residues Asp27, Asp30, Glu34, Arg38, Arg40, Glu41, Arg43, and Arg44, of which Arg42 and Arg44 are located in the disordered end. A recent study on the flexibility of the full length regulatory subunit of free RIa isoform and complexed with the catalytic subunit, using fluorescence anisotropy [43] has shown that there is a short flexible segment at the C-terminal site of the dimerization and docking domain. This could allow the interdomain/cAMP binding region to pivot about the stable AKAP-bound dimerization and docking domain, and to weakly associate with another part of the molecule, possibly the tandem cAMP binding domains of the regulatory subunit [43]. This association becomes strong when the catalytic subunit is bound, while allowing the autoinhibitory sequence of the interdomain to slip into the active site cleft of the catalytic subunit to inhibit its activity [43]. In addition, a low resolution solution structure of PKA holoenzyme by neutron contrast variation, has suggested two potentially interconverting structural models through a hinge movement at the intersection of the RIIa subunit and the autoinhibitory sequence [44]. The presence of the charges in the C-terminal face of RIIa D/D may be essential to provide flexibility for the transition of the inactive holoenzyme (with bound catalytic subunit) to active form (with free catalytic subunit), upon cAMP binding in the regulatory subunit. It is possible that in the activated form of the regulatory subunit, the charges of the C-terminal face of RIIa D/D participate in interactions with phosphorylation sites of the regulatory subunit, which are of the type Arg/Lys-Arg-X-Ser/Thr or with the arginine-rich autoinhibitory sequence. It is also possible that the C-terminal face stabilizes other protein≠protein interactions. This is the subject of current investigation. Also, mapping studies to determine a potential site of interaction between RIIa D/D with other parts of the regulatory subunit and the catalytic subunit are currently in progress, with the hope that they might shed light into the importance of the intriguing, highly charged, face of RIIa D/D. Coordinates Coordinates of the ensemble of 24 structures of RIIa D/D have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under accession no. 1L6E. Note, that residue numbering in the coordinate file runs from 1 to 46 instead of )1 to 44 as it is presented here. This is to account for the first two residues [His()1), Met0], which are added as consequence of the construction of the protein expression system.
