ABSTRACT:

The structure of a two-chain peptide formed by the treatment of the potent antimicrobial peptide microcin J25 (MccJ25) with thermolysin has been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The native peptide is 21 amino acids in size and has the remarkable structural feature of a ring formed by linkage of the side chain of Glu8 to the N-terminus that is threaded by the C-terminal tail of the peptide. Thermolysin cleaves the peptide at the Phe10-Val11 amide bond, but the threading of the C-terminus through the N-terminal ring is so tight that the resultant two chains remain associated both in the solution and in the gas phases. The three-dimensional structure of the thermolysin-cleaved peptide derived using NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations has a well-defined core that comprises the N-terminal ring and the threading C-terminal tail. In contrast to the well-defined core, the newly formed termini at residues Phe10 and Val11 are disordered in solution. The C-terminal tail is associated to the ring both by hydrogen bonds stabilizing a short -sheet and by hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, unthreading of the tail through the ring is prevented by the bulky side chains of Phe19 and Tyr20, which flank the octapeptide ring. This noncovalent two-peptide complex that has a remarkable stability in solution and in highly denaturing conditions and that survives in the gas phase is the first example of such a two-chain peptide lacking disulfide or interchain covalent bonds.

Microcin J25 (MccJ25)1 is a small antimicrobial peptide belonging to the microcin family of ribosomally synthesized defense molecules secreted by Enterobacteriaceae and mediating microbial competition (1). It has generated widespread interest recently not only because of its high potency and intriguing structural characteristics but also because of its unusual mode of antibacterial action. Although most antimicrobial peptides are characterized by a large number of positive charges and are generally considered to interact with bacterial membrane structures (2), MccJ25 contains only a single positive charge and has been shown to inhibit bacterial transcription by interacting with the  subunit of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (3, 4). Although originally isolated in 1992 from E. coli AY25 (5), it was not until 1999 that MccJ25 was characterized in more detail (6). At this point, it was proposed that the peptide consists of 21 amino acids arranged in a macrocyclic structure involving a peptide bond between the N- and the

C-terminus. This suggestion was made on the basis of a range of biochemical techniques, including amino acid composition, mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and chemical and enzymatic degradation studies (6). Such a structure was consistent with the observations that neither of the termini were accessible for amino acid sequencing, the mass was consistent with a single posttranslational condensation reaction (i.e., loss of 18 mass units relative to a linear peptide), and further, digestion with thermolysin, which cleaved the peptide chain between Phe10 and Val11, resulted in a single product with a mass corresponding to a linear peptide. Subsequently, the solution structure of both native MccJ25 and a thermolysin-cleaved analogue (t-MccJ25) was determined, and it was shown that a macrocyclic structure was largely consistent with the structural information deduced by NMR (7, 8). Several other naturally occurring antibacterial peptides with a macrocyclic backbone are known (9, 10), and synthetic examples have been prepared recently (11, 12). However, recently we and two other independent research teams analyzed MccJ25 in more detail and concluded that the original NMR structure was incorrect. We concluded that in fact MccJ25 is not a macrocyclic peptide but comprises an unusual N-terminus to Glu8 side chain amide bond resulting in a N-terminal ring structure (13-15). Further, the C-terminal tail threads through the ring thus forming a noose-like feature. From this structure, it is clear that the positioning of two aromatic side chains in the C-terminal tail on each side of the ring results in the tail being trapped,

MccJ25, t-MccJ25, and two acidic hydrolysis fragments (h18-MccJ25 and h16MccJ25) were obtained and purified as described previously (6, 8). Briefly, t-MccJ25 was prepared by thermolysin digestion of native MccJ25 (1 µmol of MccJ25 was incubated in 8 M urea at 46 °C for 30 min before digestion by 40 µg of thermolysin (Boehringer, Mannheim) in 1200 µL of NH4HCO3, 10 mM CaCl2 for 60 min at 46 °C and pH 8). h18-MccJ25 and h16-MccJ25 were obtained by adding 12 M HCl to MccJ25 at 37 °C for 10 h. The three peptides were purified by RP-HPLC on an Inertsil ODS2 column (5 µm, 4.6 × 25 mm), either under isocratic elution (acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous CF3COOH pH 2; 31:69 v/v; 1 mL/min) for t-MccJ25 or by a two-step linear gradient (acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous CF3COOH pH 2; 5-35% of acetonitrile in 35 min, followed by 35-50% acetonitrile in 5 min) for h18MccJ25 and h16-MccJ25. Finally, a t-MccJ25 derivative carrying one urea molecule at the N-terminus (u-t-MccJ25) was generated by submitting t-MccJ25 to strong denaturing conditions (8 M urea, 65 °C, 16 h) followed by purification on a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters France) to remove the denaturing agent, as described previously (8). NMR Spectroscopy. A 6 mM sample of t-MccJ25 in 100% CD3OH was used to acquire DQF-COSY, TOCSY (spin lock 120 ms), NOESY (50, 100, 150, 200, and 400 ms) and 1 H-13C HSQC and HMBC spectra on a DMX600 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance 1H-13C-15N-gradient probehead and a temperature controller system (BCU-05 refrigeration and BVT 3000 control units). Amide proton exchange rates were measured on a normal isotopic sample that was dissolved in CD3OD at 0 °C and analyzed at 0 °C for 2 h and at 20 °C over 3 days by acquiring 1-D-1H and TOCSY spectra. Structure Calculations. Distance restraints for the calculation of the solution structure of t-MccJ25 were derived from a NOESY spectrum recorded at 600 MHz with a mixing time of 100 ms. Cross-peaks were assigned and integrated in XEASY (17) and converted to distance restraints using CYANA (18). Preliminary structures calculated in CYANA were used to resolve ambiguities in assignments, and after an iterative process, a final set of 129 interresidual distance restraints, including 64 long and medium range distances, was obtained. Dihedral restraints for the backbone angle  and the side chain angle 1 were derived from 3JHNHR coupling constants and 3JHRH coupling constants in combination with intraresidual HN-H and HR-H NOE intensities, respectively (19). On the basis of this analysis, the following restraints were used:  -120° (40° for 3 JHNHR > 8 Hz (Tyr9, Phe10, Ser18, Phe19, and Tyr20); 1 60° (30° for two small 3JHRH coupling constants (Ser18 and Tyr20); and 1-60° (30° for one small and one large 3 JHRH coupling constant together with a strong/weak HNH , respectively (His5). Additional  angle restraints of -100° (80° were used in cases where a positive  angle could be excluded based on a strong sequential HRi-HNi+1 NOE in relation to the intraresidual HRi-HNi NOE (Ala3, Phe11, Ile13, and Tyr20). Finally, 10 restraints were included

FIGURE 1: Schematic illustration of the production of MccJ25. The MccJ25 gene cluster, which is located on the pTUC100 plasmid, comprises four genes: mcjA (blue), mcjB (yellow), mcjC (pink), and mcjD (green). These encode the MccJ25 precursor (McJA), two processing/folding enzymes (McjB and McjC), and an exporter protein (McjD). The latter is involved in the secretion mechanism and is presumably also crucial for the self-immunity of the producing strain.

thus preventing unfolding of the molecule (13-15). This structure provides an explanation for all biochemical data reported on the peptide, and it is clear that it is the threaded arrangement that is responsible for the remarkable stability of MccJ25. Interestingly, the structure shares significant similarities, including the presence of a central -sheet region, to the suggested macrocyclic model, highlighting the difficulty of characterizing such a complex structure. The gene structure of the MccJ25 encoding plasmid pTUC100 has revealed that MccJ25 is expressed as a 58 amino acid precursor (McJA), which is presumably processed by two auxiliary proteins (McJB and McJC) that have been found to be crucial for the production of the mature product (Figure 1) (16). A fourth protein (McJD) is encoded in the gene cluster, and the sequence homology of this peptide with ABC transporter proteins suggests that it is involved in the export of MccJ25 and thus important for the self-immunity of the producing strain (16). In this paper, we report the revised structure of thermolysin cleaved MccJ25 (t-MccJ25) and demonstrate, based on NMR and mass spectrometry data, that there is a tight association between the N- and the C-terminal fragments despite the lack of cross-links. A recent paper reported a remarkable stability of this protein by subjecting it to highly denaturing conditions, including 8 M urea and temperatures of above 100 °C, but the interpretation was based on what is now known to be an incorrect structure (8). It is therefore important to revise the structure and relate these findings to the correct structure. Furthermore, we show here that the tight two-chain association in t-MccJ25, as well as in two products generated by partial hydrolysis of MccJ25 in strong acidic conditions, survives the solution-gas phase transition. To our knowledge, t-MccJ25 is the first example of a two-chain peptide that has such a remarkable stability both in solution in highly

for five hydrogen bonds (Gly2 HN f Phe19 O, Val6 HN f Tyr20 O, Glu8 HN f Ser18 O, Phe19 HN f Gly2 O, and Tyr20 HN f Val6 O) based on slow exchange behavior and close proximity to the acceptor in the preliminary structures. The final structural family was generated in CNS (20). This protocol involves torsion angle dynamics followed by refinement by Cartesian dynamics and Powell minimization in explicit solvent (21) as described previously (22). Mass Spectrometry. The purified t-MccJ25, u-t-MccJ25, h18-MccJ25, and h16-MccJ25 were analyzed on a nanoESIIT instrument (Esquire 3000, Bruker Daltonics) operating in the positive ion mode. Ion accumulation time was controlled by the ion charge control (ICC) system of the instrument (target 10 000). A potential of -650 V was applied on the counter electrode. Peptide samples (10 pmol/ µL) were prepared in 50% MeOH/water with 0.5% formic acid. ITMS MSn experiments were performed from selected ions (2 Da width) submitted to resonant excitation amplitude from 0.5 to 1.5 VP-P. The recorded spectra are the average of 10-200 microscans to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio. Two µL of each sample was loaded into Proxeon (Odense, Denmark) nanoelectrospray tips using Eppendorf GELoaders 1-10µL (Westbury, NY). The Roepstorff nomenclature (23) was used to describe peptide fragmentations. RESULTS Protein Expression and Purification. Four cleaved forms of the native antibacterial peptide MccJ25 were prepared and purified as shown in Figure 2. These were thermolysin cleaved MccJ25 (t-MccJ25), a derivative of t-MccJ25 carrying one urea molecule at the N-terminus (u-t-MccJ25), and two fragments of 18 and 16 residues (h18-MccJ25 and h16MccJ25) that resulted from MccJ25 hydrolysis in strong acidic conditions and lacked residues T15-I17 and I13-I17,

respectively (6). On the basis of the recently established structure of MccJ25 (13-15), these four peptides should contain two distinct peptide chains. The three-dimensional structure of t-MccJ25 was calculated, and IT-MS fragmentations of the four peptides were examined to analyze the stability in the gas phase of the noncovalent interactions involved in the two-chain structure. NMR Spectroscopy and Spectral Assignment. Because of poor solubility in aqueous solvent and for comparison to the structural work recently published on native MccJ25, all NMR data for structural characterization were recorded in 100% d3-MeOH at 600 MHz. The spectral data were of high quality, with generally sharp signals and minimal signal overlap. Resonance assignments were achieved using standard 2-D sequential assignment strategies and were identical to the assignments reported by Blond et al. (8). The two proline residues (Pro7 and Pro16) were both found to be in the trans conformation as evident from strong sequential HRi-Hi+1 NOEs. For structure determination, distance restraints were derived from a NOESY spectrum recorded at 10 °C with a mixing time of 100 ms, and dihedral angle restraints were inferred from coupling constants measured from the splitting of amide signals either in the 1-D or a DQF-COSY spectra. From an analysis of chemical shifts, hydrogen/deuterium exchange, and the presence of mediumand long-range NOEs (Figure 3), it was clear that there is a tight association between the regions comprising residues 1-8 and residues 18-21. A general lack of medium-range NOEs is consistent with the absence of helical regions and tight turns, while several characteristic long-range NOEs, including a HR-HR connection between P7 and F19, indicate the presence of -sheet structure. The complete lack of medium- and long-range NOEs in the residue 10-17 region, and the fact that the majority of the resonances originating from these residues show little deviation from

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 16, 2004 4699 respectively; furthermore, they have good covalent geometry as evident from minimal deviations from ideal bond lengths and angles. It is clear that the structure has a well-defined core, which comprises the N-terminal octapeptide ring and the threading C-terminal fragment 18-21. The tail is tightly associated to the ring by the presence of both electrostatic interactions in the form of hydrogen bonding in a short -sheet as well as hydrophobic interactions between the side chains of residues Val6, Pro7, and Phe19. In addition, there is a charge-charge interaction between the negatively charged C-terminus and the positively charged His5 side chain. The core is further stabilized by the presence of the bulky side chains of Phe19 and Tyr20. For the structure to unfold, the backbone segment associated with one of these side chains has to be threaded through the ring, which based on the tight fit, would seem impossible without the breaking of bonds. Apart from the structural core, it would appear, as suggested by NOE and chemical shift data, that the residue 11-17 region is highly flexible and disordered in solution. Mass Spectrometry Analysis of the Stability of the TwoChain t-MccJ25 in the Gas Phase. To examine the stability of the two-chain structure of t-MccJ25 in the gas phase, the CID patterns of both t-MccJ25 and u-t-MccJ25 on one hand, and the hydrolysis fragments h18-MccJ25 and h16-MccJ25 on the other hand, were analyzed and compared. At a relatively low declustering potential (i.e., low ion acceleration in the high pressure zone of the source), the MS spectra of the four peptides exhibited only MH+ and [M + 2H]2+ quasimolecular ions, indicating the presence of a single species (Figure 5A). MS2 of either MH+ (m/z 1813.9) (Figure 5B) or [M + 2H]2+ (m/z 907.5) mainly resulted in a b-type ion series (m/z 1738.9, 1625.8, 1568.8, 1469.7, 1322.6, and 1159.6), which is consistent with the loss of G14-OH, I13, G12, V11, F10, and Y9, without the loss of the chain B (Figure 5C). A signal at m/z 1341.7 is observed at lower intensity, and this was concluded to result from the loss of the SFYG-OH peptide, based on further decomposition using an MS3 experiment (data not shown). This occurred probably through the cleavage of a ring peptidic bond and is consistent with the loss of the chain B noncovalently bound to the ring. The signal at m/z 1159.6, which corresponds to the ring that has lost the chain A tail but is still associated with the chain B is also observed in the MS spectrum recorded at a relatively high declustering potential (Figure 5A). The decomposition of this ion led to another b-type ion series at m/z 1084.6, 921.5, 774.4, and 687.4 (Figure 5D), indicative of the loss of G21-OH, Y20, F19, and S18 from chain B. MS3 analysis of the m/z 687.4 ion, which corresponds to the ring, showed the loss of V6, H5, G4, A3, and G2, in agreement with a previous observation on t-MccJ25 by Wilson et al. (15) that the bond between V6 and P7 was broken, thus allowing the release of the chain B residues. Similar fragmentation patterns were observed for h16MccJ25, t-MccJ25, and u-t-MccJ25. The series of b-ions in the chain A tail of h16-MccJ25 was, as expected, shifted to lower mass-to-charge ratios consistent with a mass loss of 170 Da, due to the absence of residues I13 and G14 in this peptide. Similarly, the fragmentation pattern of t-MccJ25 showed a competition between the loss of the chain B residues from G21 to V11 that are attached to the ring by noncovalent interactions and the short F10-Y9 segment

The solution structure of t-MccJ25 was determined using simulated annealing by torsion angle dynamics followed by Cartesian dynamics and energy minimization in explicit solvent (21). Of a final family of 50 structures, the 20 lowest energy structures consistent with the experimental data were chosen to represent the solution structure of t-MccJ25 and this structural family is shown in Figure 4. These structures have no distance or angle violations of above 0.2 Å and 2°,

covalently linked to the ring. In addition, u-t-MccJ25 exhibited the same chain B ion series as t-MccJ25 but shifted to higher mass-to-charge ratios consistent with an increase in mass of 43 Da, due to the presence of the urea molecule

at the N-terminus, thus confirming the origin of these ions. Taken together, these data, which are in agreement with previous results on the thermolysin-digested MccJ25 (15), clearly show that the chain B fragment, while not linked to

Structure of Thermolysin Cleaved MccJ25

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 16, 2004 4701 Tyr20 positioned on each side of the N-terminal ring play a crucial part in the stability of this peptide, as unfolding would require breakage of bonds to free the C-terminus. This is consistent with the remarkable findings of Blond et al. who reported that t-MccJ25 is not degraded by treatment by 8 M of urea at 65 °C for 16 h, a treatment that even allows coupling of one urea molecule to the peptide N-terminus, and furthermore, showed that temperatures of 165 °C were needed to irreversibly disrupt the structure (8). This twochain structure observed in solution for t-MccJ25 is also maintained in strong acidic conditions, which result in the breaking of several covalent bonds, and the extraordinary noncovalently bound complex even survives in the gas phase at a relatively high declustering potential. The latter observation has also been reported for the structurally related peptide RES-701-1 by Loo et al., who showed that such peptides are examples in which the higher order structure of a gas phase ion relates directly to its solution phase structure (24). Such an unusual structural stability (i.e., a tail being tightly locked in a ring in such a manner that it cannot be extricated from it without breakage of covalent bonds) is due to a combination of noncovalent interactions and steric hindrance related to the orientation of Phe19 and Tyr20 bulky aromatic side chains as regard to the tight ring. It has previously been shown that the thermolysin-cleaved MccJ25 retains some antimicrobial activity, although the efficacy is greatly reduced as compared to native (8). Native MccJ25 has the unique antibacterial action of inhibiting RNA polymerase but according to other reports also has the ability to disrupt membrane structures in some bacterial strains (25, 26). Nothing is currently known about which regions of MccJ25 are responsible for the inhibition of RNA polymerase, but it seems likely that some of the residue 11-16 hairpin region is involved in this interaction, and the complete disruption of this structural element would thus affect the binding. At this point, it is difficult to speculate on whether the remaining activity is due to the fact that the structural core is retained and still has the ability to inhibit RNA polymerase or if it is a result of a disruption of membranes. There are several examples of two-chain bioactive peptides with important functions. Among the most well-known is insulin, which is synthesized as a single chain peptide that is folded and oxidized to form three disulfide bonds. Subsequently, part of the chain is removed by proteolysis, which results in a bioactive product that comprises two peptide chains linked by two disulfide bonds and with a third intrachain disulfide bond (27). However, t-MccJ25 is fundamentally different from insulin in that it does not have a covalent cross-link between the chains and relies solely on the steric-link through which the C-terminal is locked in place in the N-terminal ring. Recent development of bacterial resistance toward commonly used antibiotics has sparked a widespread interest in natural antibiotic substances as potential leads for novel drugs. MccJ25 is a remarkable peptide with high potency and proteolytic and thermal stability, which makes it interesting from a pharmaceutical viewpoint. The unique structure presents a significant challenge from the perspective of chemical synthesis. In vivo, the molecule relies on the help of two plasmid-encoded processing enzymes for folding and cross-linking, and it would clearly be difficult to achieve

The bottom panels show the threaded arrangement and the retained structural core, illustrating the tight association between the N- and the C-terminal regions both in native and in t-MccJ25.

the chain A by a covalent bond, is firmly attached to it whatever its size and that this noncovalent stabilization is preserved in the gas phase upon CID experiments. DISCUSSION In this paper, we have reported the structural characterization by NMR and MS of t-MccJ25, the product of thermolysin digestion of the antimicrobial peptide MccJ25. Recently, the structure of native MccJ25 was revised, demonstrating that it is not, like first believed, a macrocyclic peptide but comprises a noose-like structure characterized by an N-terminus to Glu8 side chain link and a threaded C-terminus (13-15). From our analysis of the thermolysin cleaved peptide, it is clear that this remarkable arrangement is extremely stable, and in fact, the two chains stay together as one entity after breakage of the loop between the ring and the threaded part of the C-terminus. This unique stability of the cleaved peptide makes it interesting to further investigate what structural features of native MccJ25 are retained after enzymatic digestion. Figure 6 shows a comparison between native and tMccJ25, and from this it is clear that the core regions, including the N-terminal ring and the threading C-terminal tail, are identical. In contrast, the -hairpin region, which links the ring and the tail, is clearly disrupted in the cleaved peptide, and the result is a disordered region comprising residues 11-16. As predicted from the native structure, it appears that the bulky aromatic side chains of Phe19 and

Currently, mutational studies are being undertaken, and the results will provide additional information on both the folding process and the interaction with the chaperones as well as the mechanism of action and the inhibition of RNA polymerase. On the basis of the features of native MccJ25 and its thermolysin-cleaved analogue, such insights have the possibility to open the door for the design of novel antibiotic compounds mimicking the MccJ25 mode of action.
