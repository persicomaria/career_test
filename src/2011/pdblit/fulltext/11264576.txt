Structures of the B1 domain of protein L from Peptostreptococcus magnus with a tyrosine to tryptophan substitution
The three-dimensional structure of a tryptophan-containing variant of the IgG-binding B1 domain of protein L has been Ê solved in two crystal forms to 1.7 and 1.8 A resolution. In one of the crystal forms, the entire N-terminal histidine-tag region was immobilized through the coordination of zinc ions and its structural conformation along with the zinc coordination scheme were determined. However, the ordering of the histidine tag by zinc does not affect the overall structure of the rest of the protein. Structural comparisons of the tryptophancontaining variant with an NMR-derived wild-type structure, which contains a tyrosine at position 47, reveals a common fold, although the overall backbone root-mean-square differÊ ence is 1.5 A. The Y47W substitution only caused local rearrangement of several side chains, the most prominent of Ê which is the rotation of the Tyr34 side chain, resulting in a 6 A displacement of its hydroxyl group. A small methyl-sized cavity bounded by -strands 1, 2 and 4 and the -helix was found in the structures of the Y47W-substituted protein L B1 domain. This cavity may be created as the result of subsequent side-chain rearrangements caused by the Y47W substitution. These high-resolution structures of the tryptophan-containing variant provide a reference frame for the analysis of thermodynamic and kinetic data derived from a series of mutational studies of the protein L B1 domain.

1. Introduction
Small proteins are useful experimental systems that simplify the study of the biophysical consequences of amino-acid substitutions. The 64-residue immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding B1 domain of protein L in Peptostreptococcus magnus (Kastern et al., 1990) is a good model system for studying the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding. The structure of the wild-type protein L B1 domain (referred to as WT) was È ®rst determined by NMR (Wikstrom et al., 1994), which revealed a  fold. WT lacks disul®de bridges, metal cofactors and prolines, which can complicate folding kinetics. The thermodynamics and kinetics of folding and unfolding of the B1 domain have been extensively studied by various methods such as changes in ¯uorescence (Gu et al., 1995, 1997; Scalley et al., 1997; Yi & Baker, 1996). To follow these changes, a tyrosine at position 47 was substituted with a tryptophan (Y47W), which has a 5.5-fold greater ¯uorescence signal than tyrosine (Cantor et al., 1980). In this paper, the B1 domain containing the Y47W substitution will be referred to as the pseudo-wild-type (WT*) and all other mutant B1 domains discussed here contain the Y47W substitution. The Y47W mutation is located in the protein core and has little effect on

stability (ÁG = À19.2 Æ 0.8 kJ molÀ1 for WT* and ÁG = À21.6 Æ 0.8 kJ molÀ1 for WT; Scalley et al., 1997). A series of 70 point mutations distributed throughout WT* were analyzed for their thermodynamics and kinetics of folding and unfolding (Kim et al., 2000). It was found that in the folding transition state -strands 1 and 2 and the ®rst -hairpin turn are largely structured, while -strands 3 and 4, the second -hairpin turn and the -helix are largely disrupted (Kim et al., 2000). Interpretation of the mutational effects in that paper was based upon the NMR-derived WT structure, which contains a tyrosine at position 47. The accurate interpretation of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the mutants derived from the tryptophancontaining variant requires the atomic resolution structure of this pseudo-wild-type protein L B1 domain. We have therefore solved orthorhombic (form 1) and trigonal (form 2) forms of Ê WT* to 1.7 and 1.8 A resolution, respectively. The form 2 crystal utilizes zinc ions to facilitate crystal formation through coordination of the N-terminal histidine tag (His tag). Comparison of the NMR-derived WT structures with the two crystal-derived WT* structures revealed signi®cant rootmean-square differences (r.m.s.d.s). A methyl-sized cavity, which may be the result of the Y47W substitution, was found in the WT* structures. Interestingly, the cavity is not located at W47 but adjacent to those residues that readjusted to compensate for the mutation. The cavity in WT* provides a route to explain why several mutations have greater than expected destabilizing effects. 72 residues (Fig. 1). Puri®ed WT* was crystallized in 30% PEG 8000 and 0.2 M ammonium sulfate at 277 K (form 1). The crystallization buffer with additional 20% PEG 400 was used as cryoprotectant. The form 2 crystals were grown in 150 mM ZnOAc, 1% PEG 8000 and 50 mM MES pH 6.0 at 277 K. The crystallization buffer plus 25% glycerol and 5% PEG 400 was used as cryoprotectant. All diffraction data were collected on an R-AXIS IV image plate at 105 K using Cu K radiation Ê (! = 1.5418 A) generated by a Rigaku rotating-anode generator operating at 50 kW. The data-collection statistics for both form 1 and form 2 crystals are summarized in Table 1.
2.2. Structure determination, model refinement and validation

The structures of form 1 and 2 crystals were solved by molecular replacement using the program EPMR (Kissinger et al., 1999). The initial search model for the form 1 crystal was Ê the 71% identical protein L C3 domain structure, whose 2.3 A coordinates were kindly provided by Dr Tommy Wan and Dr Brian Sutton (private communication). Non-identical side chains were truncated to alanine (18 of 64 residues). Ê Re¯ections between 3.5 and 15 A were used for molecular replacement. Three WT* molecules related by improper non-crystallographic symmetry were found in the asymmetric unit. Attempts to use the NMR-derived WT structures as molecular-replacement models failed. The automatic model-building features of wARP (version 5.0; Perrakis et al., 1997) were utilized to build the initial form 1 WT* molecule. wARP creates an initial map based on the molecular-replacement solution and uses this map to build its 2. Materials and methods own model. After ten building cycles and 100 re®nement 2.1. Purification, crystallization and data collection cycles, wARP autobuilt three contiguous chains totaling 184 residues and 685 free waters, many of which belonged to The initial cloning, puri®cation and crystallization of the atoms of side chains and ordered waters. The ®nal wARP Y47W-substituted B1 domain of protein L (WT*) in the re®nement statistics were R = 19.2% and Rfree = 27.7%. The orthorhombic form (form 1) has been described previously ®nal wARP-generated 2Fo À Fc map is shown in Fig. 2(a). This (Johnsen et al., 2000).

The form 1 WT* structure was also independently determined from the initial molecular-replacement solution using a combination of model building by O into simulated-annealing composite omit maps and model re®nement by CNS without the aid of wARP. The same ®nal structure was obtained. The re®ned form 1 structure was used as a molecularreplacement search model to determine the form 2 structure Ê by EPMR with data between 3.5 and 15 A resolution. Re®nement was carried out using CNS with a maximumlikelihood target function and torsion-angle dynamics. The His tags were ordered in the form 2 crystals owing to coordination with Zn2+ ions from the precipitant, thereby allowing all 72 residues to be built for each monomer in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 4a). Simulated-annealing composite omit maps were utilized to ensure unbiased model building as well as accurate identi®cation and placement of zinc ions (Fig. 2b). The ®nal R factor was 18.8% and Rfree was 19.3% (Table 1). Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were not used for the re®nement of either form 1 or form 2 structures. Consequently, the comparison of molecules in the asymmetric unit could serve as an internal cross-validation of their structures as well as a means of revealing regions of conformational ¯exibility in the molecule.

The stereochemical properties of WT* structures in form 1 and form 2 crystals were examined by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). The quality of the main-chain and side-chain parameters were judged as being mostly `better' and sometimes `inside' the normal range of comparable structures at the same resolution. The Ramachandran plot showed that the monomers in both crystal forms had at least 98% of the residues in the most favored region (Table 1). Two structure-validation methods that utilize structural properties not imposed during the re®nement were also used to assess the structure quality. The environmental preference for each È residue was assessed by the program VERIFY-3D (Luthy et al., 1992). The distribution of non-bonded atoms in the neighborhood of each atom was analyzed by ERRAT (Colovos & Yeates, 1993). No violations were detected by either method.

2.3. Cavity and volume calculations

The program VOIDOO (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994) was used to calculate cavity volumes for WT* and WT. At least four cavity calculations were carried out for each molecule with randomly generated orientations in order to minimize measurement artifacts. A rolling probe with the radius of Ê 1.2 A was used for the cavity-volume calculation; for referÊ ence, VOIDOO would use a 1.4 A radius to mimic a water Ê molecule. The use of a 1.2 A radius attempts to standardize our calculated volume results with those reported in a comprehensive analysis of cavity formation in T4 lysozyme structures (Xu et al., 1998).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. The protein L B1 WT* structures

The WT* structure has a very similar fold to the WT È structure as determined by Wikstrom et al. (1994) and consists of a central -helix packed against a four-stranded -sheet (Fig. 3). The topology of -strands in WT* are mixed, where the central -strands (1 and 4) are parallel and -strands 1 and 2 as well as 3 and 4 are antiparallel. The -sheet also has a typical right-handed twist. The loop and turn regions are well de®ned in the WT* structures and showed little variation among the monomers in the two crystal forms. Each of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit of the form 1 crystals is in a heterogenic environment, making different crystal contacts with neighboring molecules and slightly affecting both backbone and side-chain conformations. The resulting main-chain and side-chain variations are

Ê re¯ected in main-chain r.m.s.d.s of 0.56 A between A and B, Ê between B and C, and 0.69 A between A and C for Ê 0.48 A residues 4±62 (Table 2). The two monomers in the asymmetric unit of the form 2 crystals are in very similar environments, unlike those in the form 1 crystals. In fact, the main-chain Ê r.m.s.d. between the form 2 monomers is only 0.29 A. The A molecules are the most similar in forms 1 and 2, with an Ê r.m.s.d. of 0.38 A. The most signi®cant side-chain variations occur at surfaces and crystal contact sites. For the form 1 crystal there were 1484 protein atoms Ê identi®ed with an average B-factor value of 22.2 A2, with the C Ê molecule having the lowest overall B factor, 20.2 A2. These B values correlate with the amount of surface area buried for Ê each molecule: molecule A has 726 A2 buried, molecule B has Ê Ê 2 buried and molecule C has 1230 A2 buried. The 1146 A highest B-factor values correspond to the C-termini of the -helix in all three molecules. Overall, there were 302 waters identi®ed in the form 1 structure; 23 of these solvent molecules have B factors of Ê 20 A2 or below and are important in making crystal contacts by forming at least two or three hydrogen bonds. There were no buried waters observed. The form 2 Ê crystal had an average B factor of 20.8 A2, including 1131 protein atoms, ten zinc ions and 214 waters (Table 1).

Based on an initial molecularreplacement model of the C3 domain and diffraction data from the form 1 crystal, a stereoview of a wARP-generated 2Fo À Fc map shows clear electron density for side chains and waters. The majority of waters picked from this map have the spherical character exhibited here. The wireframe model is taken from the re®ned form 1 molecule A structure, showing the second -turn formed by residues D53, K54 and G55, which have three consecutive positive 9 angles. The map is contoured at 1'. (b) A simulated-annealing composite omit map around a zinc-coordinated His-tag region.

The His tags (À7 MHHHHHHA 0) of the three monomers in form 1 crystals are mostly disordered; only HÀ1 is visible in molecule A. However, the His tags were ordered through coordination with zinc ions in the form 2 crystals (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the zinc is acting as a crystal contact mediator that orders symmetryrelated His-tag and non-His-tag residues (Fig. 4b). Zinc ions were identi®ed in the form 2 crystals based on the height of the electron-density peaks and coordination geometry with neighboring atoms. Moreover, zinc is the only divalent cation in the crystallization buffer. The presence of zinc was also con®rmed by the ¯uorescence wavelength scan around the zinc anomalous absorption edge (data not shown). The primary coordination to zinc is T4 tetrahedral, although T6 octahedral also occurs (Alberts et al., 1998). The average distance between zinc and its coordinating Ê atoms in the form 2 WT* structure is 2.2 A Ê for proteins and 2.9 A for waters, which is in agreement with Alberts et al. (1998). A dual zinc coordination occurs with H2, where both amides of the histidine imidiO'Neill et al.

3.3. The second b-hairpin turn

The second -hairpin turn has a distorted type IH con®guration. It is composed of four amino acids, three of which, D53, K54 and G55, have positive 9 angles in all ®ve monomers across the two crystal forms (e.g. 9 = 50.2, 60.2, 98.1 and 2 = 47.1, 26.3, À4.5 for residues 53, 54 and 55, respectively, in molecule A of the form 1 crystal). A simulated-annealing composite omit map calculated using CNS showed that the electron density in this -hairpin turn region is very clear, and the assignments of both the main-chain and side-chain conformations are unambiguous. The main chain of this turn is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the -sheet formed by strands 3 and 4. It is stabilized in this unusual position by Y56 packing against F26, which is located at the N-terminus of the -helix, as well as by a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl O atom of Y56 and the amide N atom of K7 in the ®rst -strand. This highly unusual turn places residues D53, K54 and G55 in a region of 9/2 space that is usually restricted for a lefthanded -helix on a Ramachandran plot. Since this is a less favorable region energetically, it is thought that this region of the protein is strained and therefore destabilizing. In support of this, a K54G mutation increased the overall stability (ÁÁG = +2 kJ molÀ1; unpublished data). This increased stability may come from decreased strain in the second -turn. In contrast, increasing the overall strain in this turn by replacing the preferred glycine at position 55 with an alanine decreased stability by À8.8 kJ molÀ1 and dramatically increased the unfolding rate 16-fold over WT* (Kim et al.,

2000). In the WT* structure, G55 has a positive 9 angle (98.1 ) placing it in the `generously allowed region' of the Ramachandran plot. By modeling a G55A mutation onto the WT* structure and performing energy minimization with CNS, steric clashes were predicted owing to the C methyl group of Ê A55 being only 2.5 A away from the carbonyl O atom of A55. The increased strain in the second -hairpin turn caused by steric hindrance could explain the signi®cant loss in stability for the G55A mutant. Generally, non-bonded C atoms are at

The interatomic zinc to Ê side-chain distance ranges from 2.00 to 2.36 A. Coordination is primarily tetrahedral or octahedral. Bonds between the zinc and histidines in the His tag are represented by green dotted lines. Bonds between other amino acids and zincs are shown as black dotted lines. Blue spheres represent nitrogen and red spheres are oxygen unless denoted as water (Wat). The zinc between DH 38 and HÀ2 is likely to coordinate two more waters, though the electron density for the placement of these waters was ambiguous.

Ê least 2.8 A from carbonyl O atoms, although 90% of the time Ê the distance is 3.4 A or greater (Singh & Thornton, 1990). Furthermore, the strain observed in the G55A model suggests that the increased unfolding rate of the G55A protein results from the strain acting like a spring, which is relieved upon the opening of the second -hairpin turn during unfolding (Kim et al., 2000).
3.4. Effect of Y47W substitution in WT* and comparisons with the NMR structure

Protein L has ®ve homologous B domains and three C domains that share 68±90% residue identity. Using equivalent numbering, Fig. 1 shows a sequence alignment for WT*, WT and the 71% identical C3 domain used for the molecularreplacement solution. The main-chain r.m.s.d.s for either all residues or core residues within the regular secondarystructural elements between each of the independent WT* molecules, WT and C3 domains are given in Table 2. The three monomers in the asymmetric unit are very similar to each Ê other, with an all-residue main-chain r.m.s.d. of 0.55±0.69 A. However, a representative sampling of the 98% identical NMR WT-molecule structures (solutions 1, 3, 6, 9, 13 and 17)

Ê showed a main-chain r.m.s.d. of 1.5 A when compared with WT* (Fig. 5a). This is greater than the difference between the 71% homologous C3 crystal structure and WT*, which has a Ê main-chain r.m.s.d. of 1.1 A (Table 3). As seen in Fig. 5(a), the largest differences occur in loop and turn regions, especially at the ®rst -hairpin turn and the second helix turn. When only the core residues are compared, the main-chain r.m.s.d. Ê between the WT* and WT structures is 1.27 A, which is still signi®cantly larger than the main-chain r.m.s.d. of 0.98 between the WT* and C3 structures. The large differences between the WT* and WT structures re¯ect a greater overall coordinate uncertainty in the WT NMR structures rather than the effect of the Y47W mutation. The Ramachandran plots of a representative sample of NMR-solution structures showed a mean percentage of residues in the most favored region of only 68 Æ 5%. Furthermore, the average r.m.s.d. of main-chain Ê atoms between the representative NMR solutions is 1.25 A for Ê for the core residues. This large all residues and 0.80 A internal variation in the WT NMR structures makes them less reliable for the interpretation of the small effects that aminoacid substitution may have upon interactions such as hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions. TheY47W substitution caused a signi®cant number of sidechain rearrangements when comparing the WT* and WT structures. The most signi®cant side-chain rearrangement was found with Y34. Owing to the substitution of tyrosine by a bulkier tryptophan, the side chain of Y34 in WT* rotated around 11 by about 72 and was pushed away by Ê about 5.3 Æ 0.6 A judging from its hydroxyl group (Fig. 5b). Also, Y36 Ê moved by about 2.7 Æ 0.6 A with respect to its hydroxyl positions in the WT* and WT structures. Both the Y47 of the WT structure and W47 of the WT* structure have similar 11 values.

The proteins exhibit the same overall fold, Ê though the main-chain r.m.s.d. is 1.46 A. Major differences occur in the loop regions as well as the N-terminus of -strand 4. The side chains for residues Y47/W47, Y34 and I60 are shown. The Ê substitution of Y47 in WT by W47 in WT* caused Y34 in WT* to swing 6 A away relative to the Y34 position in WT as measured by the side-chain hydroxyl group.

The repositioning of main and side chains arising from the Y47W substitution and primarily the movement of Y36 may be responsible for our observation of a small hydrophobic cavity in WT*. This cavity in WT* was detected with the program VOIDOO (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994). It is surrounded by the following residues: A8, L10, A20, F22, A33, Y36, A37 and I60 (Table 3a). A similar cavity Ê of about 20 A3 was detected in two of the ®ve random molecular orientations from only one (solution 6) of the six randomly chosen representative WT structures (solutions 1, 3, 6, 9, 13 and 17). It is more likely that there is no cavity in the NMRderived WT structures based on our

Cavity-surrounding residues.
(a) Residues and atoms surrounding the cavity. Listed in this table are the eight residues and the 23 atoms lining the cavity. Residue Ala8 Leu10 Ala20 Phe22 Ala33 Tyr36 Ala37 Ile60 Contributing atoms CB CG, CD1, CD2 CA, CB CD1, CE1, CE2, CZ C, O, CA, CB CA, CB, CG, CD2, CE2 N, CA, CB CD1

(b) Cavity sizes for each molecule in the form 1 and 2 asymmetric unit. The program VOIDOO (see x2) was used to calculated volume for the given molecule as well as for the NMR solution-structure models. Each round of cavity-volume estimation was carried out using a randomly rotating molecule. Each of WT* monomers in form 1 and 2 had different cavity sizes owing to slight rotations of side-chain and main-chain positions.

(c) Thermodynamic effects of mutations on residues surrounding the cavity. The cavity-surrounding residues have greater loss of stability upon mutation than those same residue types located at other locations in the structure, including those involved with core interactions. The data on stabilities is taken from Kim et al. (2000). Residue Ala8 Leu10 Ala20 Phe22 Ala33 Tyr36 Ala37 Ile60 Mutation Gly Ala Val, Gly Ala, Leu Gly Ala Gly Ala, Val ÁÁG (kJ molÀ1) À10.9 À11.7 +5.4, À8.8 À23.9, À14.2 À15.9 À10.0 À14.2 À19.2, À6.7

The slight variations in the placement of side chains surrounding the cavity are represented in Fig. 6, where three sets of residues corresponding to the three molecules in the form 1 asymmetric unit are superimposed. Also, VOIDOO calculated cavities of varying sizes in the ®ve monomers in the asymmetric units of form 1 and 2 crystals. In form 1, the largest Ê cavity was found in the B molecule at 31 A3, while the A Ê 3 cavity and the C molecule had the molecule had a 20 A Ê smallest cavity at 17 A3. In form 2, the cavity sizes were 27 and Ê 3 (Table 3b) in molecules A and B, respectively. These 33 A values correlate with the amount of buried surface area found at the interfaces of the molecules in the asymmetric units, suggesting the slight changes in side-chain orientation and cavity size are a consequence of some dynamic expansion and collapse in the structure. The discovery of the cavity in WT* also helps to explain why the cavity-surrounding mutations listed in Table 3(c) have greater ÁÁG values (Kim et al., 2000) than other mutations in the same class (e.g. Ala3Gly) that do not surround cavities: it is likely that they increase the size of the cavity. The exception is Y34A (ÁÁG = À12.5 kJ molÀ1), which may be more destabilizing than Y36A since it makes important hydrophobic contacts to W47. The cavity in WT* may also explain the relatively small effect of the Y47W mutation on the thermostability. One would expect that the substitution of a tyrosine by a tryptophan in the hydrophobic core should signi®cantly increase the thermostability. However, the increased hydrophobic contacts with W47 could be cancelled out owing to the creation of this cavity.

(d) Frequencies of recovered cavity-surrounding mutations with larger side chains than those in WT*. A series of random sequences were inserted into the ®rst -strand, -helix or fourth -strand. Listed here are the number of recovered residues that had a larger side chain over the total number of recovered mutants from those cavity-lining residues (data on frequency of replaced residues was taken from Kim et al., 2000). The majority of the tested replacements with larger side-chain substitutions also had increased folding rates. This data suggests that larger side chains would satisfy more van der Waals contacts by ®lling the cavity.

sampling statistics. However, it is possible that this cavity was present in the WT structure and could not be detected unequivocally owing to the large coordinate uncertainty in the NMR-derived WT structures. To clarify this issue a highresolution crystal structure of the WT molecule would need to be determined.

An overlay of the cavity and the cavity-surrounding side chains. The hydrophobic cavity, shown in gray gridwork, is located between -strands Ê 1, 2, 4 and the -helix and is centered at (7.25, 8.50, 6.25 A) in (x, y, z) coordinates in the form 1 B molecule. Side chains from the form 1 molecule A (magenta), B (yellow) and C (green) are superimposed, showing the dynamic range of side-chain organization. The residues that surround this cavity include: A8, L10, A20, F22, A33, Y36, A37, I60. A Ê rolling probe of 1.2 A was used to calculate volumes using the program VOIDOO. The cavity sizes were calculated for at least four randomly rotated molecules and then averaged. Shown here is the B molecule with Ê cavity volume of 31 A3. The other molecules have cavity sizes that range Ê from 17 to 32 A3. Parameters used in VOIDOO were: grid = 0.25, shrink factor = 0.90, plot grid = 0.2, growth factor = 1.1, minimum size of Ê secondary grid = 10, convergence criterion (% and A) = 0.1.

The cavities in model proteins such as T4 lysozyme (Eriksson, Baase, Wozniak et al., 1992; Eriksson, Baase, Zhang et al., 1992; Xu et al., 1998), barnase (Buckle et al., 1993, 1996) and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2; Jackson et al., 1993) have primarily resulted from large-to-small side-chain substitutions. In barnase, cavities of the size found in WT* can be created through Ile3Val mutations (Buckle et al., 1993). In T4 lysozyme, a series of non-polar side chains were substituted with Ê alanine, creating cavities that ranged in size from 10 to 89 A3. The consequence of these cavity-creating mutations is a reduction in stability owing to loss of favorable van der Waals contacts and hydrophobic interactions. Xu et al. (1998) estimate the energetic penalty paid for creating a cavity in T4 Ê lysozyme to be 92 J molÀ1 AÀ3. Based on this value, we could Ê expect that the cavity volume (25 A3 on average) found in WT* destabilizes the protein by approximately À2.3 kJ molÀ1 Ê Ê (92 J molÀ1 AÀ3 Â 25 A3). Thus, if the cavity could be ®lled without inducing any additional strain, we could predict that the ÁG 9 À21.6 kJ molÀ1 (WT* has ÁG = À19.2 kJ molÀ1). The C of A20 contributes to the wall of the cavity. Experimental studies reveal that the A20V mutation results in a 5.4 kJ molÀ1 increases in stability (Kim et al., 2000). This suggests that A20V stabilizes the protein to a greater extent than just ®lling the cavity. In another study, several segments of WT* (including -strand 1, -turn 1, -helix, -turn 2, -strand 4) were mutated simultaneously and then selected for IgG binding using phage-display methods (Kim et al., 2000). It is interesting to note that for the cavity-surrounding residues there is a preference for larger non-polar side chains (Table 3d). Even though stabilities tend to be lower, these mutations increased the overall folding rates. Taken together, these results suggest that the bulkier non-polar side chains satisfy more van der Waals contacts in or around this cavity. Indeed, energy-minimized modeling of L10F (from Table 3d) onto WT* suggests that the addition of three C atoms would ®ll this cavity, with only minor steric clashes. This approach has been attempted with T4 lysozyme, where two naturally Ê occurring cavities of 39 and 23 A3 exist (Karpusas et al., 1989). Here, an L133F or an A129V substitution was introduced to ®ll the larger or smaller cavities, but the resulting steric clashes decreased the stability by 1.2 and 2.9 kJ molÀ1, respectively. However, a S117F substitution ®lled the larger cavity and stabilized (4.6 kJ molÀ1) the T4 lysozyme. For L10F substitution to stabilize WT*, the side chains surrounding the phenylalanine would only need to adjust slightly to remove potential steric clashes. The WT* structure has been useful in re®ning our understanding of how mutations cause their kinetic and thermodynamic effects. We anticipate that the high-resolution structure studies of WT* and selected mutants will contribute substantially to our understanding of protein L stability and folding.
