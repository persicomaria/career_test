ABSTRACT The T lineage repertoire is shaped by T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent positive and negative thymic selection processes. Using TCR-transgenic (N15tg) 2 microglobulin-deficient ( 2m / ) RAG-2 / H-2b mice specific for the VSV8 (RGYVYQGL) octapeptide bound to Kb, we identified a single weak agonist peptide variant V4L (L4) inducing phenotypic and functional T cell maturation. The cognate VSV8 peptide, in contrast, triggers negative selection. The crystal structure of L4 Kb was determined and refined to 2.1 Å for comparison with the VSV8 Kb structure at similar resolution. Aside from changes on the p4 side chain of L4 and the resulting alteration of the exposed Kb Lys-66 side chain, these two structures are essentially identical. Hence, a given TCR recognizes subtle distinctions between highly related ligands, resulting in dramatically different selection outcomes. Based on these finding and the recent structural elucidation of the N15-VSV8 Kb complex, moreover, it appears that the germ-line V repertoire contributes in a significant way to positive selection. T lymphocytes recognize cell-associated pathogens and tumor antigens bound to class I and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules through their clonally distributed T cell receptors (TCRs; refs. 1­3). The understanding of the structure and function of TCRs is thus of theoretical as well as practical importance. Although functional studies long ago documented the dual requirement of specific peptide and MHC molecules in the T cell recognition process (4), structures of TCRs and peptides complexed to MHC molecules (pMHC) only recently have been forthcoming (5­12). As anticipated, the three-dimensional structure of the TCR resembles an antibody Fab fragment such that each of the and chains consists of Ig-like variable and constant domains with the hypervariable loops from the two variable domains forming a combining site. This site interacts with the exposed residues of a peptide that sits in the peptide-binding groove of the MHC molecule. The sides of this antigen-presenting platform are composed of two -helical segments whereas the base consists exclusively of strands (8­14). Both MHC -helices interact with the TCR and, indeed, offer a greater recognition surface than the exposed peptide residues (5, 6, 15, 16). We have focused structural efforts on a class I MHCrestricted TCR derived from a representative cytotoxic T lymphocyte clone, termed N15, with specificity for a vesicular stomatitis virus nuclear octapeptide N52­59 (VSV8) in the context of the Kb mouse class I MHC molecule (17). Prior crystallographic studies of the VSV8 Kb ligand showed that

only peptide side chains at positions p1, p4, and p6 were solvent-exposed and, hence, accessible to the TCR (13, 14, 18). Concomitant mutational studies confirmed the importance of these residues in N15 TCR recognition (17, 19). Moreover, comparison of N15 TCR-VSV8 Kb, murine 2C TCR-dEV8 Kb, and human A6 TCR-Tax HLA-A2 complexes identifies a common docking mode regardless of TCR specificity or species origin in which the TCR variable V domain overlays the MHC 2 helix and the V domain overlays the MHC 1 helix (5, 6, 15). As a consequence of this orientation, the CDR1 and CDR3 loops of the TCR and - V domains make the major contacts with the peptide whereas the CDR2 loops interact primarily with the MHC helices. To investigate in general terms how TCR recognition functions in vivo and, in particular, how the N15 TCR is involved in the process of thymic positive and negative selection, we have established N15 TCR transgenic mice (N15tg) RAG-2 / H-2b mice (20). On this genetic background, TCR expression heterodimer, thereby offering a is limited to the N15 simplified means for analysis of the N15 TCR throughout T lineage development. Using these mice, we showed previously that intravenous administration of the antigenic VSV8 peptide induced activation of mature N15 T cells in the peripheral lymphoid compartment but mediated negative selection of double-positive (DP) CD4 CD8 immature thymocytes. The negative selection of the DP thymocytes could be detected within 4 h after VSV8 administration by TUNEL assay or by the presence of activated caspases in N15 fetal thymic organ cultures (FTOC) or adult thymuses (20­22). This process is peptide-specific and independent of peripheral T cell activation (23). In this study, we report on a single altered peptide ligand (APL) variant V4L (L4) of VSV8 that induces the maturation of N15 T cells via positive selection. We then determined a high-resolution crystal structure of the L4 peptide in complex with Kb and identified focal structural differences between the VSV8 Kb and L4 Kb ligands, which induce negative and positive selection of N15 TCR-bearing thymocytes, respectively.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 (1998) B-factor refinement were carried out. The refinement was started at 15­3 Å and immediately extended to 2.5 Å and, finally, 2.1 Å. Bulk solvent correction was applied. The 2Fo Fc and Fo Fc difference maps were calculated with the peptide omitted in Fc calculation. The electron density clearly showed the replacement of Val at p4 position by Leu. A leucine residue was then built in this position of the peptide, and the Kb model was also rebuilt to better fit the density. The model was subjected to further alternative cycles of positional and B-factor refinement. The current Rfree and Rwork are 29.6% and 24.4%, respectively. The final statistics also are given in Table 2. Peptide Characterization. Peptide synthesis and analysis were performed by using methods described previously (19). For agonists, the ability of splenocytes derived from N15tg RAG-2 / mice to respond to peptide preloaded on irradiated EL-4 cells was tested exactly as described (20). Antagonist peptides for the N15 TCR were identified by using a prepulse assay for inhibition of cytotoxic T lymphocyte lysis. EL-4 cells were labeled with sodium [51Cr]chromate for 1 h at 37°C. A suboptimal concentration of VSV8 (10 pM) was introduced for the duration of the labeling. The cells were washed four times, and 5,000 cells were transferred to each well of a 96-well plate. Test peptides were added at various concentrations. After 1 h at 37°C, 5 104 N15 cytotoxic T lymphocytes were added per well. After 4 h, the plates were centrifuged and 100 l of the supernatant was removed and counted. For positive selection, / fetuses of N15tg RAG-2 / mice were dissected at 2m day 15.5 and fetal thymic lobes were cultured with or without 10 M of the indicated peptide as described (21). Human 2m (Calbiochem) was added to the AIM-V medium (GIBCO BRL) at 5 g ml, and the medium was replaced every 48 h. After 7 days, thymocytes were released from the lobes by pressing through a steel mesh, counted, triple-stained with anti-CD4, anti-CD8, and mAb R53 (anti-N15 chain clonotype), and examined on FACScan. Positive selection was observed by the increase in the percentage of CD8 singlepositive (SP) TCRhigh thymocytes. Negative selection was observed exactly as described (20).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals. N15 TCR tg RAG-2 mice were constructed as described previously (20). To create the N15 / RAG2 / 2m / mice, the N15 / RAG-2 / mice were bred with / mice that had been backcrossed for 10 generations into 2m C57BL 6 (H-2b) (The Jackson Laboratory). The heterozygous mice from the first generation were intercrossed, and offspring that were RAG-2 / 2m / N15 / were utilized as described (22). The expression of the N15 TCR as well as the lack of RAG-2 or 2m gene expression in the knockouts were detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis on peripheral blood cells as explained below. The homozygosity of the N15tg was proven by subsequent breeding analysis. All lines were maintained and bred under sterile barrier conditions at the animal facility of Dana­Farber Cancer Institute. Flow Cytometric Analysis. The following mAbs were used: anti-CD4 (H129.19) R phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled and antiCD8 (53­6.7) Red613-labeled (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY); anti-N15 [R53 (24)], anti-mouse CD45R B220 (RA3­6B2) PE-labeled (PharMingen); 5F1.1.24 (anti-mouse H-2Kb) fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled and goat anti-rat IgG FITC-labeled (Caltag, South San Francisco, CA). Thymocytes were triple-stained as follows: cells were incubated with R53 for 30 min followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat antibodies. After washing with PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) the cells were restained with PE-antiCD4 and Red613-anti CD8 mAbs for an additional 30 min in PBS containing 2% FCS and 2% normal rat serum. For RAG-2 and 2m phenotyping, peripheral blood nucleated cells were double stained with PE-anti-mouse CD45R B220 and FITC-5F1 for 30 min, and, before analysis, red blood cells were eliminated from peripheral blood cells by ammonium chloride lysis. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Samples were gated on live cells based on forward and side scatter parameters. Data (10,000 events per sample) were collected in list mode by using FACSCAN RESEARCH software and analyzed by using LYSIS II software (Becton Dickinson). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination. Crystals were grown by hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. A 10 mg ml L4 Kb protein solution was mixed up with crystallization buffer of 1.6 M phosphate 2.7% 2-methyl2,4-pentanediol 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.0 at equal volume ratio and then equilibrated against the same crystallization buffer. Crystals were grown in two different morphologies, a chunky one and a plate-like one. The former diffracted to about 2 Å, whereas the latter had a larger cell volume and diffracted to 3 Å. The chunky form was used for this high-resolution structure analysis. The crystals were first transferred from the crystallization buffer to cryoprotectant solution, which contains 30% ethylene glycol in the crystallization buffer, and then dipped into liquid nitrogen for rapid freezing. One single frozen crystal of 80 70 40 m was used for data collection at Brookhaven NSLS beamline X8C with MAR research imaging plate system at the 1.009-Å wavelength. The crystal belongs to space group P21212 with cell dimension a 136.7 Å, b 88.0 Å, and c 45.2 Å. There is one molecule per asymmetric unit. The data set was reduced and scaled by using programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (25). The overall Rsym is 7.6% in 15- to 2.1-Å resolution (see Table 2). The structure was determined by using the molecular replacement method with program AMORE (26). The search model was taken from the Protein Data Bank, using the same class I Kb molecule loaded with VSV8 (access code 2VAA). The search was done using 15- to 4-Å data only. The solution was extremely clear, with a correlation coefficient value being 66.5 (the next highest value was 38.6). X-PLOR (27) was used for refinement. Ten percent of reflections was randomly selected as a test set in the refinement. A rigid body refinement followed by alternative cycles of positional and

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
VSV8 Octamer Variants. TCR-based activation studies using mature T lymphocytes indicate that TCR recognition is exquisitely specific (1­3). Single amino acid changes of even a conservative nature within the antigenic peptide can result in loss of functional activity. Other APLs can function as antagonists or agonists in a clone-specific manner (28­31). The basis of these functional differences among peptides that bind to a given MHC molecule with the same affinity is currently a matter of substantial speculation (32). To further investigate how APLs influence mature T cell activation and thymic selection of N15 TCR-bearing cells, we created a panel of APLs by synthesizing individual VSV8 octamer variants with single amino acid substitutions at the known TCR contact residues. RMA-S stabilization assay demonstrated that all of the APLs bound to Kb with similar affinity (data not shown). Table 1 shows the sequence variation of individual peptides and summarizes their functional effect on mature peripheral N15 T cells derived from the N15tg animals. As indicated, none of the variant peptides with substitutions at the p1 or p6 position functioned as agonists to activate mature T lymphocyte proliferation against VSV8-pulsed APCs or lyse VSV8treated target cells. In addition, all three p1 substitutions (E1, A1, and K1) and the N6-substituted p6 peptide resulted in APLs with antagonist activity in cytotoxicity assay. The ability of conservative substitutions to alter function of the T cells after TCR recognition (for example, the K1 mutation) is striking and, furthermore, consistent with the findings of others studying APLs in both class I and class II TCR-

Agonist, antagonist, positive-selection, and negative-selection activities are as described in Materials and Methods. For agonists, the single, open squares represent no activation of N15 T cell proliferation as judged by stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation or N15 CTL effector function at peptide concentrations of 10 4­10 13 M. The single, solid square represents activity in N15 T cell proliferation assays requiring 10 M peptide and, in CTL assay, 1 nM. The triple, solid squares represent activity in N15 T cell proliferation assays requiring 1 nM and 100 pM in CTL assay. For antagonists, the single, open square represents no inhibition of N15 CTL effector function. The double and triple, solid squares represent 50% inhibition of the N15 CTL cytotoxicity at 500 nM peptide and 50 nM, respectively. For positive selection, the single, open square represents no increase of CD8 SP TCRhigh cells in N15tg RAG-2 FTOC incu2M bated with peptides at concentrations 10 4­10 12 M. The triple, solid square represents an increase of the CD8 SP TCRhigh thymocytes from 0.5­4% to 30­60% in N15tg RAG-2 FTOC thymic 2M lobes incubated with 10 M peptide. For negative selection, the single, open square, the single solid square, and the triple solid squares represent no deletion, 2-fold reduction, and 10-fold reduction, respectively, of the N15tg RAG-2 mice DP thymocytes 24 h after injection of 6-week-old animals with 24 g peptide i.v.

restricted systems (28­31). Substitutions at the VSV8 p4 position yielded several APLs with very different behavior from the p1- and p6-substituted peptides. For example, the I4 peptide functioned as a full agonist, equivalent to the antigenic VSV8 peptide, promoting activation of mature T lymphocytes. On the other hand, the A4 peptide failed to induce any mature T cell response whereas L4 was a weak but clear-cut agonist, requiring a 1,000­10,000 greater concentration in molar terms than VSV8 or I4 to mediate equivalent proliferation or cytotoxic effector function. Note that L4, in contrast to any of the p1 APLs or N6, failed to show antagonist activity. Phenotypic Evidence of Positive Selection Induced by the L4 Variant. To examine the APL effect on positive selection of N15 thymocytes, the N15tg RAG2 / (H-2b) were bred onto a 2m / background where class I expression is drastically reduced such that these mice lack CD8 SP cells (33­35). Fetal / thymic lobes obtained from N15tg RAG-2 / mice 2m were cultured in the presence of various APLs plus human 2m to restore antigen presentation. As shown in Fig. 1A and summarized in Table 1, only one of the peptides tested, L4, efficiently induces N15 thymocyte maturation as judged by the down-regulation of CD4 (i.e., increase in the percentage and absolute number of CD8 SP thymocytes) and the upregulation of the TCR expression level in both DP and SP CD8 thymocytes (Fig. 1B). As L4 causes reduction in the percentage of DP thymocytes when injected into N15tg RAG2 / mice (Table 1), it may also stimulate a low level of negative selection in FTOC (Fig. 1 A). With the exception of VSV8 (Fig. 1 A) and I4 (not shown), both of which strongly

FIG. 1. The L4 peptide induces positive selection of N15tg thy/ mocytes. FTOC was performed by using N15tg RAG-2 / 2m (H-2b) thymic lobes in media containing 5 g ml human 2m with or without 10 M of the indicated peptides. After 7 days, thymocytes were released from the lobes by pressing through a steel mesh, counted, and triple-stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD4, Red613conjugated anti-CD8, and mAb R53 (anti-N15 chain clonotype) plus FITC-conjugated anti-rat IgG (19). (A) The CD8 versus CD4 staining profile of total thymocytes is shown. In this representative experiment the yield of CD8 SP cells after L4 incubation was 13.5 104 cells compared with 0.3­2.2 104 cells in FTOC incubated in the absence of exogenous peptides or in the presence of the other indicated peptides. The total thymocyte number recovered from VSV8-exposed FTOC was significantly lower (105 cells per lobe) than from FTOC incubated with any of the other peptides (4­6 105 cells per lobe). (B) The histograms of the N15 TCR chain expression on DP and CD8 SP thymocytes derived from FTOC incubated with K1 or L4 peptides are shown. Note that the K1 histogram represents data similar to that obtained with the other peptides (except VSV8). The CD8 SP thymocytes that mature on L4 express a higher level of the TCR than the DP thymocytes harvested from the same lobe. (C) Thymocytes selected on L4 are functionally responsive to VSV8. Thymocytes from the organ cultures described above [cultured with ( ) or without ( ) L4] or fresh splenocytes from N15tg RAG-2 / mouse were assayed for their proliferative response to irradiated EL-4 cells, in the present of rIL-2 and 10 nM VSV8 or 10 M L4 or no peptide. After 48 h, each well was pulsed for 18 h with [3H]thymidine, harvested on filter discs, and counted. The proliferative responses for the peptides are shown. Results are mean values of triplicate samples with SD noted.

induce negative selection, all of the other APLs were without effect. L4-Mediated Functional Maturation. The above results provide phenotypic evidence of positive selection of fetal N15tg thymocytes in the presence of the L4 peptide. To determine whether the L4 peptide induced functional matu/ fetal thyration, thymocytes from N15tg RAG-2 / 2m mic lobes, which had been cultured in the presence or absence of the L4 peptide, were incubated with antigen-presenting cells pulsed with L4 (10 5 M) or VSV8 (10 8). These peptide concentrations were chosen because 1,000-fold higher concentration of the weak agonist L4 was needed to activate mature N15 T cells to a level equivalent to activation by VSV8. Fig. 1C shows that thymocytes positively selected by L4 proliferated in response to VSV8 and, to a lesser extent, to L4. Both sets of responses were significantly greater (P 0.001) than those of thymocytes that had not matured in the presence of L4. These results argue persuasively for the ability of L4 to induce positive selection of N15 TCR bearing CD8 SP thymocytes. Experiments performed in an ovalbumin-specific, H-2Kb restricted TCR transgenic model (OVA-TCR) showed that agonist APL cannot mediate positive selection of functional CD8 T cells (36). In P14 TCR tg mice, the agonist APL induced the appearance of CD8 SP thymocytes that prolif-

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95 (1998) is a hydrogen bond (within 2.6 Å) to the carbonyl oxygen of the p2 residue of the peptide. Strikingly, the aliphatic portion of the Lys-66 side chain (in particular, the C and C atoms) swings about 2.5 Å inward toward the antigen-binding groove of Kb molecule. Fig. 3 clearly shows that in the VSV8 Kb structure, there is a van der Waals contact between the C 2 atom of Val-4 in the VSV8 peptide and the C atom of Lys-66 (3.6 Å apart). In the L4 Kb structure, by comparison, the contact is between the C 1 atom of Leu-4 in L4 peptide and C atom of Lys-66 (3.9 Å apart). Apparently, the V4L replacement has caused the conformational change of the Lys-66 side chain. Given that the peptide's main chain conformation is fixed by p3 and p5 anchoring residues, two tyrosines, and this in turn mandates that the side chain at the p4 position projects against the 1 helical region in the vicinity of the Kb Lys-66 residue, any change in the peptide at p4 likely will affect the conformation of the Lys-66 side chain. VSV8 Kb fails to induce positive selection. Hence, the V4L replacement at p4 plus the attendant conformational change at Lys-66 of Kb most probably are the key structural determinants for positive selection of N15 TCR-bearing DP thymocytes by L4 Kb. The I4 peptide harboring a V4I replacement is functionally indistinguishable from VSV8 (Table 1). It is possible that the C branch present in I4 is critical for maintaining Lys-66 in the ``VSV8 Kb conformation.'' General Features of Positive Selection. What is the nature of positively selecting peptides in general? Depending on the system investigated, it has been reported that peptides with full agonistic, partial agonistic, antagonistic, and null effects on TCR function in mature T lymphocytes all can lead to positive selection of thymocytes (38­42). Affinity measurements by surface plasmon resonance of the interaction between a soluble ovalbumin peptide (SIINFEKL) Kb-restricted TCR and its peptide ligands suggests that high-affinity ligands are deleting, low-affinity ligands are positively selecting, and functional null ligands are of too low affinity to measure (43). However, measurement of the N15 TCR interaction with VSV8 Kb by similar methodology shows that the monomeric affinity is 200 M, an affinity 10 times lower than that measured between the OVA Kb-specific TCR and its positively selecting ligand (unpublished results). Yet VSV8 induces negative selection of N15 TCR-bearing DP thymocytes. These observations suggest that the minimal affinity required for a productive interaction between a TCR and its ligand may vary greatly among different TCRs such that no absolute affinity threshold mandates a positive or negative selection outcome. Nonetheless, one can imagine that the affinity of N15 for L4 Kb may be less than for VSV8 Kb. The postulated alterations in N15 CDR loops required to accommodate the L4 Kb versus VSV8 Kb ligands may occur at a significant energy cost and be associated with a faster off-rate. This difference in biophysics of the interaction may permit activation of genetic programs required for positive selection in the case of the L4 Kb ligand but largely spare activation of the caspase cascade, which leads to cell death during negative selection (21). Identification of self-peptides extracted from class I MHC molecules on thymic epithelial cell lines shows that peptides that restore positive selection in TCR transgenic TAPdeficient FTOC bear no primary sequence homology to the cognate peptide recognized by that same TCR on mature T lymphocytes (44, 45). Moreover, although the positiveselecting capacity of endogenous peptides is specific for a given TCR, these natural peptides fail to stimulate mature T cells. Furthermore, in genetically engineered mice expressing a thymic MHC class II complex bearing a single peptide, multiple TCRs are selected (46­49). Collectively, these results imply that a positively selecting ligand may bind, but weakly, to the TCRs whose differentiation it triggers. Recognition of such a positively selecting peptide bound to an MHC molecule may

erated to the cognate peptide, and those cells essentially were tolerant to the positively selecting ligands (37). In the N15tg model shown here, the weak agonist ligand (L4) is capable of inducing positive selection of mature SP CD8 cells that respond to the antigenic peptide as well as the APL that facilitated their differentiation. Hence, the N15 TCR thymocytes are not completely tolerized to the L4 peptide. Interestingly, the antigenic peptide, VSV8, failed to induce positive selection of N15 thymocytes at any concentration tested (10 5 to 10 12 M) (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Negative selection of DP N15 thymocytes could be detected in FTOC incubated with 10 5 to 10 9 M VSV8. At VSV8 concentrations lower than 10 9 M, no changes in the thymocyte number or percentages of DP and SP CD8 thymocytes could be detected in FTOC. Thus, L4 was the only peptide tested capable of inducing positive selection of N15tg thymocytes. Crystal Structure of the L4 Kb TCR Ligand. To begin to understand the differences between the N15 TCR ligands that induced positive selection (L4 Kb) versus negative selection (VSV8 Kb), the crystal structure of L4 Kb was determined, refined to 2.1 Å resolution, and then compared with the VSV8 Kb structure (13, 14). The relevant crystallographic data are summarized in Table 2. The complex crystallized under very similar conditions as the wild-type VSV8 Kb, with both using phosphate as precipitant and a similar pH (7.0 versus 6.25). Both L4 Kb and VSV8 Kb crystals belong to the same space group, P21212, and have similar unit cell dimensions (136.7 Å, 88.0 Å, 45.2 Å for L4 Kb versus 138.1 Å, 88.9 Å, 45.7 Å for VSV8 Kb). The 3% smaller L4 Kb unit cell volume is mostly because of shrinkage resulting from the freezing of the L4 Kb crystal preceding diffraction data collection. Given the overall similarities between these two crystals, it was expected that the two peptide­MHC structures would be very similar, as was indeed the case. Aside from some surface side chains, the only significant changes observed were restricted to the local region around the p4 position of the bound peptide. Although a somewhat different conformation of the Arg at p1 is observed, the lack of clear-cut density for this side chain in the VSV8 Kb structure makes it unlikely to represent a true difference from that of L4 Kb (D. Fremont, personal communication). Fig. 2 is a view of a portion of the final 2Fo Fc difference Fourier with refined VSV8 Kb and L4 Kb structures superimposed on the map. The conformation of the variant peptide's leucine side chain is unambiguous. In addition, as a consequence of the one methylene group extension from Val-4 in the VSV8 peptide to Leu-4 in the L4 peptide, the exposed side chain of Lys-66 on the 1 helix of the Kb molecule changes its conformation. Two significant polar interactions maintain the -amino group of this lysyl side chain in the same fixed position. One is a salt bridge (within 2.8 Å) to Glu-63 one helical turn N-terminal to Lys-66 in the 1 domain. The other

Very recently, the crystal structure of N15 TCR in complex with the H57 anti-C Fab fragment has been reported at 2.8 Å resolution as well as a low-resolution structure of the same TCR in complex with VSV8 Kb (7, 15). From these two structures, it is likely that the TCR contact area around the p4-Lys-66 local region consists of Tyr-28, Leu-29, and Ile-30 of the V CDR1 loop and possibly Tyr-102

Note that the view is such that the TCR would dock roughly from the top of the figure and the Kb 3 and 2m domain would be located at the bottom of the figure, i.e., below this MHC peptide-presenting platform.

of the V CDR3 loop. These are all suitable hydrophobic residues, which might interact with the exposed hydrophobic surface of the local region involving the p4 and Lys-66 side chains. It is tempting to speculate that the focal surface-shape change of this region in L4 Kb versus VSV8 Kb may necessitate corresponding shape changes within the TCR, especially involving those CDR1 loop residues in the V domain. This kind of discrete structural plasticity in protein­protein interfaces has been observed in another system (50) and may be the determining factor for the positive selection we have observed experimentally. If CDR1 plays a significant role in this recognition process, as predicted, then positive selection may be encoded, at least in part, in germ-line V genes. This notion would not be unreasonable in view of the fact that the number of endogenous peptides required to generate the T cell repertoire in the thymus must be less than the number of cognate peptides for which various TCRs are specific in the peripheral T cell compartment (42). The preponderance of key residues at peptide positions recognized by the V domain also is consistent with the view that the V domain has a critical role to play in recognition during thymic development as well as mature T cell function. Moreover, the TCR subunit is induced late in development relative to the TCR subunit, thereby appearing within DP thymocytes in anticipation of subsequent positive selection events. By contrast, chain expression appears earlier within the DN thymocyte population (51, 52). Conformational alteration of central MHC -helical residues such as K66 imposed by individual peptide side-chain modifications likely magnifies even small differences among TCR ligands, making the recognition process highly efficient. Previously observed alterations in a given MHC molecule induced by APL variants of a single peptide (53) or unrelated peptides (54) are consistent with this hypothesis. Further mutational and functional studies can clearly test these speculations.
Note Added in Proof. We have now determined the crystal structure of I4 Kb. As predicted, the conformation of K66 in I4 Kb structure is similar to that in the VSV8 Kb structure. Both the C 1 and C 1 atoms of Ile at the p4 position make close contacts (3.4 Å and 2.6 Å, respectively) to the C atom of K66.

FIG. 1. The L4 peptide induces positive selection of N15tg thy/ mocytes. FTOC was performed by using N15tg RAG-2 / 2m (H-2b) thymic lobes in media containing 5 g ml human 2m with or without 10 M of the indicated peptides. After 7 days, thymocytes were released from the lobes by pressing through a steel mesh, counted, and triple-stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD4, Red613conjugated anti-CD8, and mAb R53 (anti-N15 chain clonotype) plus FITC-conjugated anti-rat IgG (19). (A) The CD8 versus CD4 staining profile of total thymocytes is shown. In this representative experiment the yield of CD8 SP cells after L4 incubation was 13.5 104 cells compared with 0.3­2.2 104 cells in FTOC incubated in the absence of exogenous peptides or in the presence of the other indicated peptides. The total thymocyte number recovered from VSV8-exposed FTOC was significantly lower (105 cells per lobe) than from FTOC incubated with any of the other peptides (4­6 105 cells per lobe). (B) The histograms of the N15 TCR chain expression on DP and CD8 SP thymocytes derived from FTOC incubated with K1 or L4 peptides are shown. Note that the K1 histogram represents data similar to that obtained with the other peptides (except VSV8). The CD8 SP thymocytes that mature on L4 express a higher level of the TCR than the DP thymocytes harvested from the same lobe. (C) Thymocytes selected on L4 are functionally responsive to VSV8. Thymocytes from the organ cultures described above [cultured with ( ) or without ( ) L4] or fresh splenocytes from N15tg RAG-2 / mouse were assayed for their proliferative response to irradiated EL-4 cells, in the present of rIL-2 and 10 nM VSV8 or 10 M L4 or no peptide. After 48 h, each well was pulsed for 18 h with [3H]thymidine, harvested on filter discs, and counted. The proliferative responses for the peptides are shown. Results are mean values of triplicate samples with SD noted.

FIG. 4. Smads 2 and 4 can interact with CBP in vivo. Cos-7 cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of epitope-tagged activated TBF- type-1 receptor, Smad expression construct, or empty expression vector. The cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-CBP P300 antisera. Coprecipitating Smad proteins were detected by Western blot. The upper two panels demonstrate that significant amounts of both Smad2 and Smad4 protein coimmunoprecipitate with CBP P300 in the presence of the activated receptor. These interactions are inhibited by the simultaneous expression of either Smad6 or Smad7 but not by cotransfection of an empty expression vector (pCIneo). The bottom panels confirm comparable Smad2, Smad4, and activated receptor expression by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with antisera against the epitopes fused to these proteins.

FIG. 6. 12S E1A inhibits the association of activated Smad2 and Smad4 with CBP in vivo. Cos-7 cells were transfected with expression constructs expressing epitope-tagged (HA, Flag) versions of Smad2 and Smad4 and the indicated combinations of activated TBF- type-1 receptor and 12S E1A expression vector. The cells were subsequently lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-CBP p300 antisera, and levels of coimmunoprecipitating Smad proteins were determined by Western blot. The bottom panels confirm comparable Smad2, Smad4, and activated receptor expression.
