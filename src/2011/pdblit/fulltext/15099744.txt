Abstract Transglutaminases catalyze the cross-linking and amine incorporation of proteins, and are implicated in various biological phenomena. To elucidate the physiological roles of transglutaminase at the molecular level, we need to identify its physiological protein substrates and clarify the relationship between transglutaminase modification of protein substrates and biological responses. Here we examined whether betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT: EC 2.1.1.5) can be a substrate of tissue-type transglutaminase by in vitro experiments using porcine liver BHMT and guinea pig liver transglutarninase. Guinea pig liver transglutaminase incorporated 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine and [3 H] histamine into BHMT in a time-dependent manner. Putrescine and spermidine also seemed to be incorporated into BHMT by transglutaminase. In the absence of the primary amines, BHMT subunits were cross-linked intra- and intermolecularly. BHMT activity was decreased significantly through the cross-linking by transglutaminase. Histamine incorporation slightly reduced the BHMT activity. Peptide fragments of BHMT containing the glutamine residues reactive for transglutaminase reaction were isolated through biotin labelling, proteinase digestion, biotin-avidin a affinity separation, and reverse phase HPLC. The results of amino acid sequence analyses of these peptides and sequence homology alignment with other mammalian liver BHMT subunits showed that these reactive glutamine residues were located in the region near the carboxyl terminal of porcine BHMT subunit. These results suggested that the liver BHMT can be modified by tissue-type transglutaminase and its activity is regulated repressively by the modification, especially by the cross-linking. This regulatory reaction might be involved in the regulation of homocysteine metabolism in the liver. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

primary amino groups of either protein-bound lysine or free amines, resulting in protein/protein cross-links or protein/amine conjugates. In the absence of amine substrates, reactive glutamine residues are deamidated into glutamic acid residues. These enzymes are widely distributed in animal tissues and fluids and are classified into at least five groups based on biochemical properties and encoding genes: plasma-, keratinocyte-, tissue-, prostate-, and epidermis-types. In humans, nine isozymes of transglutaminase have been found so

far and form a large protein family (Grenard, Bates, & Aeschlimann, 2001). Several transglutaminases are involved in diverse biological functions, such as blood clotting, wound healing, keratinization of epidermis, and stiffening of the erythrocyte membrane [for reviews, see references (Aeschliman & Paulsson, 1994; Chen & Mehta, 1999; Fesus & Piacentini, 2002; Griffin, Casadio, & Bergamini, 2002). Transglutaminases also seem to be involved in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation (Birckbichler & Patterson, 1978; Birckbichler, Orr, Patterson, Conway, & Carter, 1981; Kannagi, Teshigawara, Noro, & Masuda, 1982; Murtaugh, Arend, & Davies, 1984). Liver transglutaminase is one of the most extensively studied tissue-type transglutaminases, but its physiological role is not clearly understood. Hand, Elliot and Griffin (1988) reported a reduction of cytosolic transglutaminase activity in chemically induced liver carcinogenesis. Peritoneal injection of retinoic acid increased the activity of this enzyme in rat liver (Piacentini, Fesus, Sartori, & Ceru, 1988). Liver transglutaminase may participate in the apoptosis of hepatocytes (Fesus, Thomazy, & Falus, 1987; Fesus, Thomazy, Autouri, Ceru, Tarcsa, & Piacentmi, 1989) and in the formation of cross-linked protein matrices at sites of cell-to-cell contact (Slife, Dorsett, & Tillotson, 1986). Cytosolic transglutaminase activity of guinea pig liver increases during the postnatal growth phase (Ikura, Suto, & Sasaki, 1990). Interleukin-6, a multifunctional cytokine which stimulates the synthesis of acute-phase proteins and their secretion in hepatocytes, increases the expression of transglutaminase genes in human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells (Suto, Ikura, & Sasaki, 1993). Grenard et al. reported that transgiutaminase-mediated cross-linking is involved in the stabilization of exracellular matrix in human liver fibrosis (Grenard et al., 2001). A tissue-type transglutaminase of rat liver was shown to be a new class of GTP-binding protein that participates in receptor signaling (Nakaoka et al., 1996). Furthermore hepatocyte growth factor (Katoh et al., 1996a) and epidermal growth factor (Katoh et al., 1996b) have been reported to induce transglutaminase in rat hepatocytes and the induced transglutaminase may negatively regulate the growth signal of these factors through the down-regulation of their receptors.

The identification of its physiological substrate(s) and the clarification of the relationship between modification of protein substrates by transglutaminase and biological phenomena are imperative to understand the physiological roles of transglutaminase at the molecular level. Our previous study using a 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine as a transglutaminase-directed labelling probe for protein substrates indicated that 44 kDa proteins from mouse, rat, and guinea pig liver extracts, which have similar amino-terminal sequences, are possible acyl-donor protein substrates (amine-acceptor substrate) of transglutaminase (Ikura, Kita, Fujita, Hashimoto, & Kawabata, 1998). In this study, the 44 kDa proteins were identified as a subunit of betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT: EC 2.1.1.5) by the sequence homology search. Here we examined the possibility that BHMT can be a substrate of tissue-type transglutaminase by in vitro experiments using porcine liver BHMT and guinea pig liver transglutaminase.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Guinea pig liver transglutaminase was purified on an immunosorbent column using monoclonal antibody as described previously (Ikura, Sakurai, Okumura, Sasaki, & Chiba, 1985). BHMT was purified from porcine liver by the reported procedures (Garrow, 1996) except that proteinase inhibitors, such as 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (APMSF) (20 M) and pepstatin (1 M) were added to the buffer used for homogenization of liver. Other materials were obtained commercially from the sources indicated: 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine and monomeric avidin (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), biotinylated bovine serum albumin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), Block Ace (a blocking solution containing milk proteins) (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan), streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA), [2,5-3 H] histamine and ECL-Western blotting detection system (Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ, USA), silver staining reagent (2-D silver stain II Daiichi)(Daiichi Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan), bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan),

Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), V8 proteinase (endoproteinase Glu C), APMSF, and pepstatin (Wako Pure Chemicals Co., Osaka, Japan), and Inertsil ODS-3 column (GL Sciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan). 2.2. Amino acid sequence homology search The sequence homology search was done by using a searching server BLAST of National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA (NCBI). 2.3. Amine incorporation by transglutaminase The reaction mixture for the incorporation of 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine into BHMT contained 40 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 60 g/ml BHMT, 5 mM 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine, 5 mM CaCl2 , 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 g/ml guinea pig liver transglutaminase. The reaction was started by the addition of transglutaminase at 37  C and stopped by the addition of 1/10 volume of 0.4 M EDTA. The biotinylated proteins were detected by Western blotting analysis using the streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate as a probe. When the transglutaminase reactions were examined in the presence of [3 H] histamine and other unlabeled amines, such as histamine, putrescine, and spermidine, the reaction conditions were the same as described above except that 2 mg/ml BHMT and 20 g/ml guinea pig liver transglutaminase were used. The incorporation of [3 H] histamine into BHMT was determined by the filter paper method (Lorand, Campbell-Wilkes, & Cooperstein, 1972). The reaction mixtures (20 l each) were spotted at intervals onto filter paper discs (Whatman No. 3MM) treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid in acetone. The discs were washed as described elsewhere (Lorand et al., 1972), and the radioactivity on each disc was counted in 5 ml of toluene-based scintillation fluid by a liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Model 1900CA). The counting efficiency of 13% was used to calculate the amount of histamine incorporated into BHMT. 2.4. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting SDS-PAGE was done in a discontinuous buffer system by the method of Laemmli (Laemmli, 1970).

The gel was subjected to Coomassie brilliant blue staining or silver staining. Western blotting was done essentially by the method of Burnette (Burnette, 1981). In brief, the biotinylated proteins separated in the SDS-PAGE gel (11%) were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose paper (0.45 m). The paper was immersed in a blocking solution containing milk proteins (Block Ace) for 2 h to coat any additional protein binding sites, then dipped into phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM Na-phosphate (pH 7.2)/0.15 M NaCl) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (0.05 g/ml) for 1 h to allow biotin-avidin reactions to complete. The paper was rinsed in PBS, followed by PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20, and finally in PBS, the biotinylated proteins on the nitrocellulose paper were detected by a chemiluminescence reaction with an ECL-Westem blotting detection system according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2.5. Determination of ammonia released during transglutaminase reaction Ammonia released during the transglutaminase reaction was determined enzymically by the use of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase. Aliquots of 0.15 ml of the reaction mixtures terminated by the addition of EDTA were brought to a final volume of 0.20 ml in assay mixtures containing 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM -ketoglutarate, 0.12 mM NADH, and 160 units of glutamate dehydrogenase. After the incubation for 90 min at 25  C, the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was measured. Ammonia was estimated using a molar extinction coefficient for NADH of 6.22 × 103 . 2.6. Cross-linking by transglutaminase The reaction mixture for cross-linking contained 40 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mg/ml BHMT, 5 mM CaCl2 , 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 20 g/ml transglutaminase, and incubated at 37  C. At intervals, 20 l aliquots were taken, mixed with the sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, and heated in boiling water for 3 min. Cross-linking products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. When the product was subjected to gel filtration chromatography, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1/10 volume of 0.4 M EDTA. A non-cross-linked

control sample was prepared by adding EDTA before the addition of transglutaminase. 2.7. BHMT assay The BHMT activity was determined by measuring the produced methionine colorimetrically. This method was based on Cantoni's method (Cantoni, 1962) for the assay of dimethylthetin-homocysteine methyltransferase activity. The reaction mixture contained, in a total volume of 0.35 ml, 28 mM betaine (trimethylglycine), 9.4 mM dl-homocysteine, 20 mM K-phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 28 mM NaCl, and enzyme. The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme solution at 37  C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.25 ml of 2.0 M NaOH. To this mixture, 0.15 ml of 1% nitroprusside was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37  C for 5 min. To this 0.5 ml of HCl­phosphoric acid (9:1) mixture was added. The solution was placed at room temperature for 3 min and centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. The absorbance of the solution at 515 nm was measured. 2.8. Gel filtration chromatography of cross-linked BHMT with Superose 6 HR column After stopping the reaction, the cross-linking reaction mixture containing 1.6 mg BHMT was dialyzed against 40 mM Tris­HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 M KCl, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA (buffer A). The dialysate was concentrated to 0.2 ml and applied to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was developed with the same buffer by using a Shimadzu AI liquid chromatography system, at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. 2.9. Identification of biotinylated glutamine residues of BHMT 5-(Biotinamido) pentylamine was incorporated to porcine BHMT by guinea pig liver transglutaminase under the conditions described above except that 1.2 mg/ml BHMT and 20 g/ml transglutaminase were used. The reaction proceeded in a total volume of 6 ml at 37  C for 90 min and stopped by the addition of 0.6 ml of 0.4 M EDTA. Then the reaction mixture was dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. The

biotinylated BHMT was reduced and pyridylethylated as follows. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in 1.0 ml of 0.13 M Tris­HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 6.0 M guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1 mM EDTA, and mixed with 10 l of 0.16 M dithiothreitol. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The mixture containing biotinylated and reduced BHMT was mixed with 10 l of 0.5 M 4-vinylpyridine and incubated at room temperature for 90 min. The reaction mixture containing biotinylated, reduced, and pyridylethylated BHMT was dialyzed against 10% acetic acid and lyophilized. The lyophilized sample was again dissolved in and dialyzed against 10% acetic acid and lyophilized. To digest the biotinylated, reduced, and pyridylethylated BHMT by endoproteinase, we dissolved the lyophilized sample (7.2 mg) in 3.5 ml of 50 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 3.0 M urea and mixed with 3.5 ml of the same Na-phosphate buffer containing V8 proteinase (72 g) and incubated at 37  C for 20 h. To remove urea from the proteinase digest sample, we pretreated the digest with a reverse-phase Sep-Pak C18 cartridge. The proteinase digest was put into the cartridge, washed with 20 ml of water, and eluted with 10 ml of 60% acetonitrile and 4 ml of 100% acetonitrile. The eluted fractions were pooled and lyophilized. Biotinylated peptides in the digest were isolated and recovered by affinity chromatography with an avidin column as follows. The lyophilized proteinase digest was dissolved in 2 ml of 0.1 M Na-phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 0.15 M NaCl (buffer B) and loaded onto a column containing the immobilized monomeric avidin (1.1 cm × 2.0 cm) which had been equilibrated with buffer B. The loaded column was washed with buffer B until all unbound peptides were washed out, and then the adsorbed biotinylated peptides were eluted from the column with buffer B containing 2 mM biotin. The eluted fractions containing biotinylated peptides were pooled, adjusted pH to 6.0 by adding 1 M HC1, and put on an Inertsil ODS-3 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and a linear gradient of 0­80% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was developed for 80 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Eluted peak fractions were pooled and lyophilized. The peptide in each lyophilized sample was dissolved in 50 l of 10% acetic acid and subjected to MALDI­TOF­mass spectrometry and sequence analysis.

2.10. Mass spectrometry and amino acid sequence analyses The biotinylated peptides were analyzed in the positive mode by a MALDI­TOF mass spectrometer (Kratos Kompact MALDI II). Sinapinic acid was used as the matrix and accelerating voltage was 20 kV. The amino acid sequences of the peptides were determined with an automatic gas phase sequencer (Shimadzu PPSQ-10). 3. Results 3.1. Identification of BHMT as a candidate of protein substrate with sequence homology search Previously we isolated 44 kDa proteins from mouse, rat, and guinea pig liver extracts as amine acceptor protein substrates of transglutaminase by using 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine as a probe for transglutaminase-catalyzed labelling (Ikura et al., 1998). The molecular mass of 44 kDa was estimated by the SDS-PAGE analyses. This time these 44 kDa proteins having similar amino-terminal sequences were identified as a subunit of BHMT by a sequence homology search. Table 1 shows the homology of amino-terminal sequences of 44 kDa proteins and BHMTs from mouse, rat, and human. BHMT from

human liver was reported to have a hexamer structure consisting of the subunits with an identical molecular mass (Skiba, Wells, Mangum, & Awad, 1987). The molecular mass of the native porcine liver BHMT was determined to be around 260 kDa from its elution profile from a gel filtration column (described later). Thus the porcine BHMT seems to also have a hexamer structure consisting of 44 kDa subunits. 3.2. Amine incorporation into BHMT by transglutaminase Guinea pig liver transglutaminase, a typical tissuetype transglutaminase, incorporated 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine into porcine liver BHMT in a timedependent manner (Fig. 1). In the presence of 5 mM 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine, BHMT was not cross-linked to a multimer by transglutaminase (data not shown). Guinea pig liver transglutaminase also incorporated [3 H] histamine into BHMT timedependently (Fig. 2). During the reaction for 60 min, about 2.0 mol of [3 H] histamine was incorporated per 44 kDa subunit of BHMT.

subunit of BHMT, respectively. These results indicated that the BHMT subunit has at least two glutamine residues reactive for transglutaminase reaction, and BHMT protein can be a substrate for cross-linking or deamidation catalyzed by transglutaminase. 3.4. Cross-linking by transglutaminase The cross-linking of BHMT protein by transglutaminase was examined in the presence and absence of primary amines (histamine, putrescine, and spermidine). Fig. 4A shows that, in the absence of the primary amines, about half of BHMT subunits were cross-linked to dimer and multimers by transglutaminase in the early phase of the reaction. Throughout the reaction (5­30 min) the significant amount of dimer product remained. This result suggested that the subunits reactive for transglutaminase reaction become mostly non-available for the reaction after they once are cross-linked to the dimers. All of the cross-linking products (Figs. 4A and 7A lane CP) contained a split band of 44 kDa. This split band is probably due to the formation of cross-link(s) within the subunit. Even after cross-linking reactions of 30 min (Fig. 4A) and 60 min (Fig. 7A lane CP), significant amount of BHMT subunits remained unmodified. In the presence of the primary amines (Fig. 4B), which are good acyl-acceptor substrates of tissue-type transglutaminase (Fesus & Piacentini, 2002; Williams-Ashman & Canellakis, 1980), hardly any cross-linking of BHMT occurred. The amines should have inhibited the cross-linking competitively with the reactive -amino groups of lysine residues of BHMT. These results indicated that the glutamine residues of BHMT which are reactive for the transglutaminase reaction can be used both for the formation of -( -glutamyl) lysyl crosslinks between the subunits in the absence of amine substrates and for the sites of amine incorporation in the presense of amine substrates. 3.5. Effects of modification on BHMT activity

3.3. Ammonia release by transglutaminase Ammonia is a common by-product of all kinds of protein modification catalyzed by transglutaminase, such as amine incorporation, cross-linking, and deamidation of glutamine residues. The ammonia released from the substrate protein BHMT during the transglutaminase reactions for 60 min in the presence and absence of amines was determined (Fig. 3). In the absence of amines, 1.7 mol of ammonia was released per subunit of BHMT. In the presence of 10 mM histamine, 10 mM putrescine, and 10 mM spermidine, 2.0, 1.8, and 1.7 mol of ammonia were released per

Effects of the cross-linking and amine incorporation by transglutaminase on the enzymatic activity of BHMT were examined (Fig. 5). Cross-linking reduced the activity of BHMT by 43% and amine incorporation reduced it by 15­20%. Although we did not confirm the incorporation of putrescine and spermidine

Fig. 5. Effects of modification by transglutaminase on porcine liver BHMT activity. Porcine BHMT was modified (cross-linking and amine incorporation) by guinea pig liver transglutaminase in the presence and absence of amines under the same conditions as those employed in the experiments shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Each amine was added at 10 mM. Relative activity was based on the activity of the control sample (C) which was treated with transglutaminase in the presence of 36 mM EDTA and in the absence of amines. Results represent means ± S.D. from three activity assays. The presence of 12 mM EDTA in each assay system did not affect the BHMT activity.

Fig. 4. Cross-linking of porcine liver BHMT by guinea pig liver transglutaminase. The conditions of the cross-linking reactions in the absence (A) and presence (B) of amines are as described in Section 2. Zero-time product was prepared by adding 1/10 volume of 0.4 M EDTA before the addition of transglutaminase. Each amine (Hst; histamine, Put; putrescine, Spd; spermidine) was added at 10 mM. Products (1.2 g each) from the terminated reaction mixtures were applied onto SDS-PAGE gel. The protein bands in the gel were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The solid arrowhead indicates the position of monomer subunit of BHMT and the open arrowhead indicates the possible position of the monomer cross-linked within the subunit. D and M indicate the positions of dimer and multimer products, respectively.

chemically here, these amines should be incorporated much like histamine because of their high reactivity as substrate. 3.6. Analysis of cross-linked BHMT by gel filtration chromatography The porcine liver BHMT cross-linked by transglutaminase was applied to the gel filtration column

(Superose 6 HR) to analyze its molecular size distribution in the buffer without denaturing reagents. The control sample (non-cross-linked BHMT) was eluted as a single peak (Fig. 6A), the apparent molecular mass of which was estimated to be 260 kDa from a standard curve based on the elution times of molecular mass marker proteins: aldolase (158 kDa); catalase (232 kDa); ferritin (444 kDa); thyroglobulin (669 kDa) (data not shown). These results suggested that the porcine liver BHMT has a hexamer structure consisting of 44 kDa subunit like a human liver BHMT (Skiba et al., 1987). An elution profile of the cross-linked BHMT (Fig. 6B) showed four protein peaks 1­4: peaks 1­3 were eluted earlier than peak 4 that was eluted at the same position as that of the control sample (260 kDa). Peak 3 was estimated to be around 520 kDa corresponding to double the size of the BHMT molecule. These results indicated that the porcine liver BHMT molecules can be linked through the formation of intermolecular cross-links by transglutaminase. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 7A) indicated that the three peaks eluted earlier than peak 4 contained subunits cross-linked to multimers. These multimers were not detected in peak 4. The existence of dimer subunit in peak 4 indicated that the cross-linking

Cross-linking was done for 60 min. Peak numbers are shown in (B).

of BHMT by transglutaminase also caused the formation of subunit cross-links within the hexamer molecule. The activity of BHMT cross-linked by transglutaminase decreased as the molecular size became larger through the inter-molecular cross-linking (Figs. 6B and 7B). Intra-molecular cross-linking between subunits also repressed the BHMT activity (peak 4 in Fig. 7A and B). 3.7. Identification of glutamine residues of BHMT reactive for transglutaminase reaction The glutamine residues of BHMT available for the transglutaminase-catalyzed amine incorporation and probably for the cross-linking were identified by a biotin-labelling method. At first, 5-(biotinamido) pentylamine was incorporated into BHMT by transglutaminase. Then, from the proteinase digest of the modified BHMT, the biotinylated peptides were isolated, recovered, separated, sequenced, and subjected to mass spectrometry as described above. The amino acid sequences and mass numbers of four peptides (peptides 1­4) are shown in Table 2. In each of these

four peptides, the determined mass number agreed with the mass number estimated on the assumption that the unidentified amino acid residue (X) is a biotinylated glutamine residue (Table 2). From this agreement, we judged that the four peptides contained glutamine residue(s) biotinylated by transglutaminase. Peptides 1, 2, 3, and 4 contained 1, 2, 3, and

and similar to this peptide sequence exist in the region (residues 382­396 of amino acid sequence) near carboxyl-terminal ends of mouse (Neece, Griffiths, & Garrow, 2000), rat (Forestier, Reichen, & Solioz, 1996), and human (Garrow, 1996) BHMT subunits: mouse (LMQQKEATTEQQLRE), rat (LMQQKEATTEQQLRA), and human (LMQQKEATTEQQLKE). Full-length amino acid sequences of these three BHMT subunits are highly similar (Garrow, 1996; Neece et al., 2000; Forestier et al., 1996). The amino acid sequence of porcine BHMT has been determined for 272 residues from the amino-terminal end (Garrow, 1996), and the determined sequence was highly similar to the sequence of the corresponding region of human BHMT (Garrow, 1996). Therefore, the amino acid sequence of BHMT from mammals seemed to be highly conserved. These findings indicated that the identified peptide of porcine BHMT, which had four glutamine residues reactive for transglutaminase reaction, must be located in the region near the carboxyl-terminal end of its subunit.

4. Discussion The identification of substrate proteins is critical for the establishment of the functional role of protein-modifying enzymes in the biological systems. Some substrate proteins for tissue-type transglutaminase, which work as amine acceptors and/or amine (lysine) donor substrates, have been reported (Fesus & Piacentini, 2002; Griffin et al., 2002; Csosz, Keresztessy, & Fesus, 2002). In this study, we demonstrated that liver BHMT having a hexamer subunit structure can be modified by tissue-type transglutaminase from the results of in vitro experiments. BHMT is mainly expressed in the liver and kidney cortex (Sunden, Renduchintala, Park, Miklasz, & Garrow, 1997). This enzyme is a zinc-dependent (Millian & Garrow, 1998) and cytosolic (McKeever, Weir, Molloy, Scott, 1991) enzyme found in the pathway of choline oxidation and catalyzes the conversion of betaine and homocysteine to dimethylglycine and methionine. Quantitative analyses of incorporated radioactivity and released ammonia during the histamine incorporation by transglutaminase indicated that the BHMT subunit has two glutamine residues highly reactive for

We quantified the amount of eluted BHMT in peaks 1,2,3, and 4 by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Relative activity was based on the activity of non-cross-linked BHMT. The presence of 0.25 mM EDTA in each assay system did not affect the BHMT activity.

4 biotinylated glutamine residues, respectively, and these four peptides were attributable to one peptide LMQQKEATTEQQLRE. The sequence homology search showed that the amino acid sequences identical

the transglutaminase reaction. These two glutamine residues seem to react rapidly in the early stage of the reaction. Four reactive glutamine residues were identified in the proteinase digest of BHMT by the biotin-labelling method using 5-(biotiamido) pentylamine as an amine substrate. The identified reactive glutamine residues of BHMT were present as two adjacent glutamine residues. Several reports have indicated the presence of glutamine residue reactive for transglutaminase reaction in two adjacent glutamine residues of proteins, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 (Jensen et al., 1994), A3-crystallin (Berbers et al., 1984), and osteonectin (Hohenadl et al., 1995). Sato, Yamada, Shimba and Takahara (2000) proposed a unique substrate specificity of two adjacent glutamine residues in a peptide of EAQQIVM (the amino-terminal sequence of fibronectin) for guinea pig liver transglutaminase: the dual amine-incorporation into the glutamine residues occurs sequentially (first at the residue on the amino-terminal side). The patterns of modified glutamine residues of the four biotinylated peptides isolated here (Table 2) also suggested the sequential reactivity of two sets of two adjacent glutamine residues of BHMT protein: two adjacent glutamine residues on the amino-terminal side react earlier than those on the carboxyl-terminal side, and of the two adjacent residues the glutamine residue on the carboxyl-terminal side reacts first. The carboxyl-terminal region where the reactive glutamine residues are present seems to form a hydrophilic and molecular surface region of BHMT subunit judging from the hydropathy analysis (data not shown). Results from SDS-PAGE of the cross-linked BHMT (Figs. 4A and 7A lane CP) showed that about half of BHMT subunits were cross-linked to dimer and multirners by transglutaminase in the early phase of the reaction and the cross-links were also formed within the part of subunits. However significant amount of BHMT subunits remained non-cross-linked. These results indicated that some of the subunits assembling BHMT molecule are non-available for the crosslinking catalyzed by transglutaminase. This might explain the discrepancy between the results described above that apparently only two glutamine residues of BHMT subunit were reactive for transglutaminase reaction although four reactive glutamine residues were identified in the BHMT subunit. The exact arrangement of BHMT subunits has not yet been analyzed.

BHMT is involved in catabolism of homocysteine together with two other enzymes methionine synthase (EC 2.1.1.13) and cystathionine synthase (EC 4.2.1.22). Regulation of homocysteine metabolism has become of interest in recent years because elevated levels of homocysteme in human plasma have been shown to be an independent risk factor for the development of various vascular diseases (Refsum, Ueland, Nygard, & Voilset, 1998). The findings of our in vitro studies described here suggested a possibility that tissue-type transglutaminase regulates repressively the activity of liver BHMT by intra- and inter-molecular cross-linking. To verify the physiological significance of this regulatory reaction, the occurrence of BHMT modification by transglutaminase in cells and tissues has to be confirmed. Hitherto various monomeric proteins that can serve as substrates for the tissue-type transglutaminase catalyzed cross-linking have been reported. Some of these proteins exhibited altered or new functional characteristics following their modification of cross-linking. Intermolecular cross-linking of phospholipase A2 dramatically increased its catalytic activity (Cordella-Miele, Miele, & Mukheijee, 1990), interleukin-2 was convertred into a factor cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes by its dimerization (Eitan & Schwartz, 1993), midkine activity was enhanced by its dimerization (Kojima et al., 1997), and dimerized S19 ribosomal protein functioned as a monocyte chemotactic factor in the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells (Horino et al., 1998). Along with these findings, the present findings suggest the diversity of physiological roles of tissue-type transglutaminase.
