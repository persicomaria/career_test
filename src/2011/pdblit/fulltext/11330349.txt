The X-ray structure analysis of a cross-linked crystal of concanavalin A soaked with the tripeptide molecule as the probe molecule showed electron density corresponding to full occupation in the binding pocket. The site lies on the surface of concanavalin A and is surrounded by three symmetryrelated molecules. The crystal structure of the tripeptide complex was refined at 2.4-Å resolution to an R-factor of 17.5%, (Rfree factor of 23.7%), with an RMS deviation in bond distances of 0.01 Å. The model includes all 237 residue of concanavalin A, 1 manganese ion, 1 calcium ion, 161 water molecules, 1 glutaraldehyde molecule, and 1 tripeptide molecule. This X-ray structure analysis also provides an approach to mapping the binding surface of crystalline protein with a probe molecule that is dissolved in a mixture of organic solvent with water or in neat organic solvent but is hardly dissolved in aqueous solution.
KEY WORDS: Concanavalin A; tripeptide; X-ray structure.

1. INTRODUCTION Proteins are generally not stable in most organic solvents; the crystals have to be lightly cross-linked with glutaraldehyde before being transferred into organic solvents. For example, for probing the protein surface to understand the structural factors involved in nonaqueous catalysis (Klibanov, 1989), glutaraldehyde-cross-linked crystals of subtilisin in acetonitrile were used (Fitzpatrick et al., 1993). No change occurs in the overall structure of the protein as it is transferred into the organic solvent although some changes do occur in side-chain reorientation. In another example, in the development of a new drug design methodology involving multiple solvent crystal structure, the entire surface of the target protein is probed (Allen et al., 1996) by solving the crystal struc-

ture of the protein in organic solvents to reveal subsites not occupied by substrates and their analogs. In the present experiment, we mapped the binding surface of crystalline protein with a probe molecule that is hardly dissolved in the mother liquid but well dissolved in mixtures of organic solvent with water or in neat organic solvent. Concanavalin A was chosen as the model protein. It is one of a group of plant protein known as lectins. It has one saccharide-binding site (Naismith et al., 1994; Kanellopoulos et al., 1996; Naismith & Field, 1996; Hamodrakas et al., 1997), two distinct metal-binding sites, one nonpolar binding site (Edelman & Wang, 1974), and one binding pocket probed by the acetonitrile molecule (Qian et al. 1998). Peptides similar to saccharides have been sorted from random peptide libraries, for example, some hexapeptides and octapeptides can bind with concanavalin A (Scott et al., 1992; Oldenburg et al., 1992). The tripeptide YPY is the consensus sequence of most of the peptides that can bind concanavalin A. In the present experiment we chose it as a probe molecule to dissolve in mixtures of organic solvent with water. The result of this study shows the presence of tripeptide YPY binding concanavalin A in a binding pocket. 59

Crystal Preparation Concanavalin A purchased from Shanghai Dongfong Biochemical Company was crystallized in hanging drops by a vapor diffusion method at 25°C (Hardman and Ainsworth, 1972). The lyophilized concanavalin A powder was dissolved in a buffer containing 0.35 mol/L NaCl and 0.01 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at a concentration of 25 mg/ml concanavalin A. The droplets were composed of 3 µl of concanavalin A solution and 3 µl at 2.2 mol/L aqueous sodium phosphate (pH 5.45), and were equilibrated against an aqueous solution of 2.2 mol/L sodium phosphate. Crystals normally appeared in 3 days and grew to suitable size 0.5 ×0.4 ×0.4 mm)in 15 days. The cross-linking treatment was carried out according to the general method of Quiocho and Richards (1964; Quiocho et al., 1967). The crystals were soaked in 1.2 mol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.45) containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 40 min. The crosslinking crystals were subsequently washed eight times with the same buffer without glutaradehyde, and again eight times with distilled water. The tripeptide YPY was provided by Prof. K. Wang (Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry). The complex was formed by soaking the cross-linking crystal for 20 days at 25°C in a solution containing 4 mmol/L tripeptide YPY in sodium phosphate buffer, 0.012 mol/L, and 10% isopropanol at pH 5.45.

Observations are those with I/(I)  1.00. Rmerge =  Ii - I /  Ii. c Values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell (2.51­2.4 Å).

2.2. Data Collection X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku RAXIS-IIC imaging plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode X-ray generator operating at 40 kV and 100 mA. Reduction of data was performed with the program package PROCESS. Data collection statistics are presented in Table I.

2.3. Structure Refinement Conventional refinement of the positions and Bfactors was performed using the X-PLOR program (Brünger et al., 1987). The initial resolution range was set as 8.0­3.0 Å and was extended to the highest resolution step by step. It was followed by mutual rebuilding into SIGMMA-weighting (Read, 1986) electron density maps with the TURBO-FRODO graphics program (Roussel and Cambillau, 1989). The behavior of Rfree was monitored (Brünger, 1992) at all times.

The starting model for the refinement was the PDB coordinates of concanavalin A (Naismith et al., 1994). In the initial model, only the atomic coordinates of the protein molecule and metal ions were introduced and all the temperature factors of the atoms were set at 20 Å2. The differences of in electron density map showed the presence of the water molecules. The sites of water molecules were added to the model whenever the electron density level was at least 3.0 in the (Fobs-Fcalc) exp(icalc) maps. The molecules introduced were inspected visually to check whether the hydrogen-bonding geometry was correct, and they were given an initial B-factor of 20 Å2. No oligopeptide atoms were included in the refinement until the refinement of the protein had reached convergence and the tripeptide YPY density pattern was clear-cut. Based on the shape of the electron density, a tripeptide YPY was identified at the binding pockets. The model of tripeptide YPY was fit to an electron density map calculated with coefficients of the (2Fobs-Fcalc) exp(icalc) map contoured at the 0.8 level. When the R-factor reached 17.5% for all data, the final refinement statistics were obtained as given in Table II.

61 Large deviations are observed in the region between residue T120 and E122. The main-chain movement is 1 Ä at E122 (Fig. 3). The second important difference between the wild-type and complex structures is found for E183 and S184 located in the binding pocket. Depending on the size of the bound tripeptide molecule, there is slight structural rearrangement (Fig. 4). Residue E183 and the residue Q132 of a symmetrical molecule move in order to maintain the crystal contact between atom NE2 of Q132 and atom OE1 of E183 (as observed in the wildtype structure). The main-chain atoms of the residue E183 are shifted on average ~0.84 Å, and its side chain is rotated about 30° and 110° around the CA­CB bond and CB­CG bond, respectively. At the same time, the side chain of the residue Q132 is rotated about 30° and 115° around the CB­CG bond and CG­CD bond, respectively. There also is a conformational change of the side chain of several residues in the binding pocket region (Fig. 4). The OG of T15 adopts a distinctly different position in the complex by rotating approximately 90° around the CA­CB bond and makes a strong hydrogen bond with the residue of the Y3001. The side chain of S134 is rotated about 90° around the CA­CB bond. The OG atom switches its hydrogen bonding from the atom of OE1 of Q137 to the water molecule. This water molecule is also present in the wild-type structure, but shifts 1.0 Å from the original position that is occupied by the hydrophobic portion of the P3002 of the tripeptide.

tripeptide, it is important to verify the quality of the structure on which this discussion is to be based.4 At the 1 level in the final (2Fobs-Fcalc) exp(icalc) map, all the atoms in the model of concanavalin A have a well-defined pattern of electron density except for the region T120­E122, which is located at the edge of the fourstranded -sheet excursion. The quality of the model is demonstrated by the observed electron density for the residues of the side chain in the binding pocket region (Fig. 1). All protein residues that directly contact the bound ligand (tripeptide YPY) can be observed very clearly in the electron density maps. It is noteworthy that T15 located in the binding pocket exhibits a strong, well-defined density and has a lower temperature factor in the tripeptide complex structure. The lower temperature factor for this residue is indicative of its participation in tripeptide binding. Initial difference Fourier showed clear density corresponding to a tripeptide in the binding pocket. After refinement the tripeptide can be determined according to the shape of the density map. The final electron density map and the structure of the tripeptide are shown in Fig. 2.

3.3. Concanavalin A­Tripeptide Interaction The tripeptide molecule found at crystal contacts is bound in a pocket that has contributions from three concanavalin A molecules in the crystal lattice. Its presence is justifiable in the context of the crystalline environment. Notably, the binding site for the residue Y3001 is in the vicinity of the saccharide-binding site. Y3001 is located 13 Å from the saccharide-binding site and about 14 Å from the metal ion-binding site Å (Fig. 5). The residue Y3001 is the N-terminal residue of the tripeptide molecule. It is sandwiched between the T15 and D151 of a symmetry-related molecule. On one side of the phenol rings of Y3001, the aliphatic portion CB of T15 is stacked against the aromatic ring at a distance of 3.44 Å. On the other side, the amide plane of O­C­N of the residue D151 of a symmetry-related molecule is ­ parallel stacked against the aromatic ring with a van der Waal distance of 3.38 Å. As shown in Fig. 6, the backbone nitrogen atom of Y3001 makes strong hydrogen bonds with the atom OG1

of T15 and the atom OE1 of Q132 of a symmetry-related molecule. Atom O of Y3001 is 2.8 Å from the OG of residue S21. The residue P3002 is a second nonpolar residue of the tripeptide molecule. Only the atom O of P3002 makes a hydrogen bond with the atom OE2 of the residue E 87 of a symmetry-related molecule. The residue Y3003 is the C-terminal residue of the tripeptide. The atom O of the carboxyl group of Y3003 makes two hydrogen bonds of length 2.65 and 2.85 Å with atom N of K135 and atom N of D136 of a symmetry-related molecule, respectively. But atom N of D136 of a symmetry-related molecule forms another hydrogen bond to OT of the carboxyl group at a distance of 3.17 Å.

4. DISCUSSION The solubility of the tripeptide YPY is very low in aqueous solutions but increases when substantial amounts of organic solvent are present. In the present work, 10% isopropanol was added in aqueous solutions. However, since a crystal of concanavalin A is destroyed in a mixture of isopropanol with water, the crystals has to be cross-linked in aqueous solutions before being transferred into the aqueous solution mixed with isopropanol. In the present work, as in our previous work (Qian et al., 1998), the crystals were cross-linked with glutaraldehyde, which randomly links lysine side chains within a single molecule or between two neighboring

Crystal Structure of Complex of ConA and Tripeptide molecules in the crystal. Therefore, the crystals retained their mechanical integrity and showed high resolution in X-ray diffraction. The cross-linked crystal as compared to the wild-type structure (Fig. 3) shows neither a change in the space group nor significant changes in the unit cell parameters. This confirms that the structure of concanavalin A is not affected by cross-linking. The result of this experiment provides an approach to mapping the binding surface of a crystalline protein with a probe molecule that is dissolved in a mixture of organic solvent with water or in neat organic solvent and is scarcely dissolved in aqueous solution.
