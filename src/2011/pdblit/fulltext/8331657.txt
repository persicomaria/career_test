Arg15 is a conserved active-site residue in class Alpha glutathione transferases. X-ray diffraction studies of human glutathione transferase A1-1 have shown that N' of this amino acid residue is adjacent to the sulfur atom of a glutathione derivative bound to the active site, suggesting the presence of a hydrogen bond. The phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr9 also forms a hydrogen bond to the sulfur atom of glutathione, and removal of this hydroxyl group causes partial inactivation of the enzyme. The present study demonstrates by use of site-directed mutagenesis the functional significance of Arg15 for catalysis. Mutation of Arg15 into Leu reduced the catalytic activity by 25-fold, whereas substitution by Lys caused only a threefold decrease, indicating the significance of a positively charged residue at position 15. Mutation of Arg15 into Ala or His caused a substantial reduction of the specific activity (200 or 400-fold, respectively), one order of magnitude more pronounced than the effect of the Tyr9~Phe mutation. Double mutations involving residues 9 and 15 demonstrated that the effects of mutations at the two positions were additive except for the substitution of His for Arg15, which appeared to cause secondary structural effects. The pK~ value of the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr9 was determined by UV absorption difference spectroscopy and was found to be 8.1 in the wild-type enzyme. The corresponding pK~ values of mutants R15K, R15H and R15L were 8.5, 8.7 and 8.8, respectively, demonstrating the contribution of the guanidinium group of Arg15 to the electrostatic field in the active site. Addition of glutathione caused an increased pK, value of Tyr9; this effect was not obtained with S-methylglutathione. These results show that Tyr9 is protonated when glutathione is bound to the enzyme at physiological pH values. The involvement of an Arg residue in the binding and activation of glutathione is a feature that distinguishes class Alpha glutathione transferases from members in other glutathione transferase classes.

Introduction
Glutathione transferases (GSTs) have been studied from a variety of perspectives including differential gene expression of isoenzymes, evolution of the gene superfamil~ xenobiotic and endobiotic substrates, Abbreviations used: CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; GSH, glutathione; GST, glutathione transferase. A rational nomenclature for human GSTs has been agreed upon (Mannervik et al., 1992); GST A1-1 designates a member of the Alpha (A) class composed of two identical subunits 1. 0022-2836/95/140765-09 $08.00/0

role in the cellular defense against genotoxic electrophiles, etc. (Mannervik, 1985; Ketterer, 1988; Mannervik & Danielson, 1988; Pickett & Lu, 1989; Board et al., 1991; Armstrong, 1991). Nevertheless, the catalytic mechanism of the glutathione transferases remains obscure. It is generally accepted that one of the roles of the enzyme is to promote the dissociation of the sulfhydryl group of glutathione to generate the nucleophilic thiolate which is the molecular species attacking the electrophilic substrafe (Jakoby & Habig, 1980; Graminski et al., 1989; Mannervik & Danielson, 1988).

Arg15 in the Active Site of Glutathione Transferase A 1-1

(Reinemer et al., 1991, 1992; Dirr et al., 1994; Garcla-S~ez et al., 1994), Mu (Ji et al., 1992; Raghunathan et al., 1994), and Alpha (Sinning et al., 1993) has sho.wn that a Tyr residue, which is conserved close to the N terminus in most of the known glutathione transferases, forms a hydrogen bond to the sulfur atom of glutathione or glutathione derivatives bound at the active site. This Tyr residue appears to contribute to catalysis by promoting the formation of the glutathione thiolate and by directing the sulfur atom into a position suitable for nucleophilic attack on the second substrate. Removal of the hydroxyl group of the active site Tyr residue by a Tyr ~ Phe mutation causes a reduction in the catalytic activity by approximately two orders of magnitude (Stenberg et al., 1991a; Kolm et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1992). However, in the class Alpha enzymes, h u m a n GST A1-1 (Stenberg et al., 1991a) and rat GST 1-1 (Wang et at., 1992), the percentage of remaining activity in the Tyr ~ Phe mutants is approximately tenfold ltigher than in the corresponding mutants of enzymes from the other classes. This finding received a possible explanation b y the structural analysis of GST A1-1, which demonstrated that the sulfur of the glutathione derivative in the active site of the e n z y m e (Figure 1) is within hydrogen-bonding distance of N Cof Arg15 as well as the hydroxyl group of Tyr9 (Sinning et al., 1993). In addition, Arg15 displays other structural features: its backbone N H forms a hydrogen bond to the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr9; the methylene groups of Arg15 are located in the active site, in

which they contribute to the hydrophobic binding site (H-site); and its guanidinium group forms a salt link with the side-chain carboxylate of Glu104. Arg15 is conserved in the known class Alpha sequences except in a chicken liver GST, which contains Lys instead (Chang et al., 1992), while Glul04 is preserved in the majority of the sequences determined. This ionic interaction has no counterpart in the three-dimensional structures of the class Pi and class Mu enzymes. In order to establish the role of Arg15 in the function of h u m a n GST A1-1, Arg15 was replaced with Lys, Leu, Ala and His. Double mutants in which Tyr9 was mutated into Phe were also constructed and characterized. The pK.~ value of the phenolic hydroxyl group of the active site Tyr9 was determined by spectrophotometric titration for the wild-type e n z y m e as well as for some mutants and was shown to be d e p e n d e n t on the amino acid residue at position 15. A preliminary report of the work has b e e n presented (Mannervik et al., 1993).

Figure 1. Active-site residues interacting with the sulfur atom of glutathione bound in the G-site of human class alpha glutathione transferase A1-1. The phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr9 and the N *of the guanidinium group of Arg15 form hydrogen bonds with the sulfur atom; the hydroxyl group of Tyr9 is also linked by a hydrogen bond to the main-chain NH of Arg15. The guanidinium group of Arg15 is further engaged in an ionic bond with the side-chain carboxylate of Glul04. The methylene groups of Arg15 are integral parts of the hydrophobic binding site (H-site) for the second substrate and appear to block the entry of water molecules into the active site region. The Figure is based on the published coordinates for human glutathione transferase A1-1 containing S-benzylglutathione in its active site (Sinning et al., 1993). For clarity of presentation, the benzyl group, which is situated below the methylene groups of Arg15 is not shown. Distances indicated by dashed lines are given in Angstr6m units.

Table 1 shows a comparison of specific activities determined for the wild-type h u m a n GST A1-1 and mutant enzymes obtained b y directed mutagenesis of Tyr9 into Phe and Arg15 into Lys, Leu, Ala and His, as well as double mutants containing combinations of Tyr9 and Arg15 mutations. Three different substrates, CDNB, cumene hydroperoxide and androstenedione, were chosen in order to monitor the effects of the mutations on three different types of chemical reactions that the e n z y m e can catalyze: aromatic substitution, reduction of hydroperoxides, and isomerization of carbonyl-containing alkenes. Table 1 shows that the mutations have essentially the same effect on all three reaction types with the exception of the R15L mutant, which demonstrated a low peroxidase activity and relatively high activity with androstenedione as compared with the CDNB reaction. It is noteworthy that the R15A and R15H mutations are more detrimental to the activity than the Y9F mutation. In contrast, the R15K mutant

retained approximately 30% of the specific activity of the wild-type enzyme. The kinetic parameters k~.~t, --mk'cs",,~.~t~" cs" and ~-~/~' ~°t~-,, were determined with CDNB as the electrophilic substrate (Table 2). Some of the mutants had such low activities that accurate values could not be obtained owing to the relatively high rate of the non-enzymatic reaction. Consequentl~ values for these mutants have not been estimated. In general, the effects reflected in the specific activities are mimicked in the k~.~,~Kin values determined. The dependence of k ~ . J K ~ s" on pH was determined for the different mutants (Figure 2). The wild-type enzyme showed a maximum at pH 7.5. The R15K mutant showed a similar pH profile but the entire bell-shaped curve was shifted towards more basic values such that the pH-optimum was approximately at pH 8. Mutation of the active-site Tyr into Phe (mutant Y9F) eliminated the descending limb of the basic side of the pH/activity curve (Figure 2B), as previously shown also for human GST P1-1 (Kolm et al., 1992). The mutants R15L and R15A as well as the double mutant Y9F,R15K displayed optima at pH 8. The pH profiles for R15H and Y9F,R15H were less distinct. Because of the low activities in comparison with the non-enzymatic reaction the latter data were more difficult to evaluate accurate134 but it appeared significant that the activities of the R15H and Y9F,R15H mutants were somewhat elevated in the range of low pH values. The following parameters were obtained by non-linear regression analysis of the pH dependence curves of the respective enzyme forms: wild-type, pK,,=6.2(_+0.05), pK.~2= 9.2( _+1.5); R15K, pK,~= 7.3(+0.2), pK,2 = 8.5(-+0.2), R15L, pK,, = 7.3(+0.1), pK.~2= 9.3(_+0.1); and Y9F, pK,~ = 7.1(_+0.1). The ionization behavior of the active-site Tyr9 was studied by UV absorption difference spectroscop)~ Difference spectra for GST A1-1 (and mutants) were recorded and the measured difference in absorption at 293 nm was assigned to ionization of the phenolic

hydroxyl of Tyr. Figure 3(A) shows difference spectra of wild-type GST A1-1 at pH 7.5, 8.25 and 9.1. Determination of the spectral change as a function of pH allowed the determination of a pK, of 8.1(_+0.1) for ionization of the wild-type enzyme by fitting the equation AA2~3= AAmax/(1 + [H ÷]/Ka) to the titration data using the SIMFIT program package (Bardsley et al., 1989). The assignment of this low pK0 value to the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr9 was based on a comparison with the Y9F mutant subjected to the same spectrophotometric titration; very limited increase of absorption was detected in the relevant pH range (Figure 3(C)). The number of tyrosinate groups per subunit was estimated to be approximately 1.3, when the background absorption from the Y9F mutant had been subtracted (Figure 3(C)). Considering the uncertainty about the true molar extinction coefficient for tyrosinate in the folded protein struc~re and the experimental error, the value is in agreement with the expected stoichiometry of one group per subunit. The R15K, R15H, and R15L mutants tested appeared to have pKa values for Tyr9 that were

elevated above the wild-type value (pK.1 = 8.1) by 0.4( 4- 0.1), 0.6( + 0.2) and 0.7( 4- 0.1) unit, respectivel}~ In the presence of a saturating concentration of GSH (2 mM), the titration curve was biphasic with estimated pK, values of pK.~l = 6.6 and pK,2 = 9.2. The lower pK,1 is close to the value expected for ionization of enzyme-bound GSH, assuming that GST A1-1 lowers the pK, of GSH in a fashion similar to that of rat GST 3-3 (pK° of bound GSH = 6.6) (Graminski et al., 1989), whereas pK,2 is similar to the pK.~ value obtained for tyrosinate formation in the Y9F mutant (pK, = 9.3(4-0.1). This result indicates that ionization of GSH bound in the glutathione

binding site (G-site) counteracts dissociation of Tyr9 into the phenolate form as shown by the pK, value being increased from 8.1 to 9.2. In the case of enzyme-bound S-methylglutathione, sulfur cannot acquire a negative charge and the pK, value of Tyr9 is therefore u n p e r t u r b e d . Thus, binding of S-methylglutathione to GSTAI-1 gave difference spectra and a p H dependence indistinguishable from that of ligand-free e n z y m e (Figure 3(B)). In order to further probe the functional properties of the different e n z y m e forms, inhibition studies were performed with glutathione derivatives as well as other inhibitors used previously (Table 3).

effects were reported as 130values determined in the standard assay system with the addition of Ki values for S-hexylglutathione and S-benzylglutathione. Mutants R15A and R15H were less strongly inhibited than the wild-type enzyme with all inhibitors. In part this may be due to increased K,, values, which will be reflected in the I~ values. Ki values for S-hexylglutathione and S-benzylglutathione were increased sixfold and 7.5-fold in mutant R15K as compared to the wild-type values, whereas those of mutant R15L were unaffected (Table 3). In contrast, mutants R15K and R15L were relatively more sensitive to some inhibitors, e.g. the glutathione conjugate of ethacrynic acid. The thermal stability of the purified R15A, R15H, R15L and R15K mutant proteins was tested by incubation at 55°C. Equal protein concentrations were used for the different mutants and aliquots were taken for measurement of residual activity at different time points. No major difference between mutant and wild-type enzymes in the inactivation was found that would indicate loss of stability due to the mutations (data not shown).

Discussion
Structural analysis of GST A1-1 (Sinning et al., 1993) shows that N ~ of Arg15 and the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr9 are in a spatial orientation allowing hydrogen bonding to a lone pair of electrons of the sulfur atom of S-benzylglutathione bound in the active site (Figure 1). The structure of the enzyme in complex with GSH is not yet available for GST A1-1, but the corresponding Tyr hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond to the GSH in the active site of rat GST 3-3, a class Mu enzyme (Ji et al., 1992). The role of a Tyr residue in activating the sulfur atom of GSH in the catalytic mechanism is furthermore indicated by structural studies of porcine and human Pi class GSTs (Reinemer et al., 1991, 1992; Dirr et al., 1994). It is also noteworthy that the carbonyl group of a conserved Gly (residue 14 in GST A1-1) has an unusual orientation, which prevents it from interacting with the active-site Tyr (Sinning et al., 1993). However, neither Mu nor Pi class GSTs have an Arg residue within bonding distance to the sulfur

atom of GSH in the active site. It therefore appears as if Alpha class GSTs differ from the other GSTs in this significant feature of the catalytic apparatus. Evidence for a functional role of the hydroxyl group of Tyr9 in human GST A1-1 has been provided by site-directed mutagenesis (Stenberg et al., 1991a). The present investigation demonstrates that also Arg15 contributes to the catalytic activity of the enzyme. To investigate the possible roles of Arg15, a series of mutations was constructed. By replacing Arg15 with Lys (mutant R15K), the positive charge present in the G-site is maintained. A Lys at position 15 could either interact with the thiolate of GSH or form a salt bridge to Glul04, but not realize both possibilities simultaneousl)~ The Arg and Lys side-chains occupy approximately the same volume (Creighton, 1993). By the incorporation of the uncharged Leu instead of Arg (mutant R15L), the volume is essentially maintained and the contribution of the positive charge of Arg15 can be estimated. In this case, while no ionic interactions are possible, the hydrophobic cavity is preserved. However, replacement of Arg15 with Ala (mutant R15A) removes all possible interactions with either substrate, except the backbone hydrogen bonding to the hydroxyl of Tyr9. To further investigate the importance of a basic side-chain for catalytic function, Arg was replaced with His (mutant R15H). Table 1 shows that the effects on the specific activities of the various mutations, as a first approximation, were the same for the three distinct electrophilic substrates investigated. This result leads to the conclusion that both Arg15 and Tyr9 contribute to catalysis by activating GSH rather than the electrophilic substrates, since the latter represent discrete types of chemical reactions with different transition states. Mutant R15L differs from the general pattern in having a relatively low activity with cumene hydroperoxide and a relatively high activity with androstenedione (Table 1). The introduction of the hydrophobic side-chain of Leu probably helps to maintain the hydrophobic cavit34 of which the methylene groups of Arg15 are a part. The binding of a steroid molecule, such as androstenedione, could be expected to be favored by an apolar environment. The R15A and R15H mutants have significantly lower specific activities and kc,,/Km values than the Y9F mutant. Modelling of the R15A mutant suggests that both the tyrosine hydroxyl and GSH thiol are accessible to solvent, which may explain the lowered catalytic efficiency: On the other hand mutant R15K has 20 to 30% of the activity of the wild-type enzyme, indicating the importance of the positive charge of the side-chain of residue 15. While the apparent K~sH is unaffected for mutant Y9F, mutations of Arg15 significantly increase this parameter (Table 2). Mutant R15K demonstrates a sevenfold increase in K~s", indicating loss of affinity for GSH. The positive charge of the ammonium group of Lys, which in contrast to that of the guanidinium group of Arg is not delocalized, could

770

Arg15 in the Active Site of Glutathione Transferase A1-1

still contribute to the electrostatic field in the G-site and facilitate the deprotonation of GSH and maintain high catalytic efficiency Model building shows that the side-chain of Lys at position 15 can replace the side-chain of Arg15 to form a salt bridge with Glul04. In this configuration the Lys residue cannot, in addition, form a polar bond to the sulfur atom of GSH, such as the one found in the wild-type structure (Figure 1). The loss of this contribution to transition state stabilization for the reaction of CDNB with the enzyme-GSH binary complex is reflected in a AAG value of 6.7 kJ mol-' (Table 4). The spectrophotometric determination of the pK., value of Tyr9 in human GST A1-1 (pK.,=8.1) indicates a decrease of 2 pH units as compared to the pK, value of free tyrosine in solution (pK, = 10.1: Creighton, 1993). The increased pK, value (pK, = 9.2) observed in the presence of GSH (Figure 3B) provides evidence for protonation of Tyr9 upon binding of GSH. This implies that the sulfllydryl group of enzyme-bound GSH is a stronger acid than is the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr9. In spite of this, the tyrosinate does not appear to serve as a general base in the catalytic mechanism, as suggested for class Pi GSTs (Meyer et al., 1993; Karshikoff et al., 1993), but rather as a hydrogen bond donor, since the activity decreases in the pH range in which Tyr9 ionizes into its basic form (Figure 2). The effect of mutations of Arg15 on the pK, for Tyr9 can be used to monitor the contribution of the guanidinium group to the electrostatic fields in the G-site. A positive charge in the side-chain of residue 15 facilitates the ionization both of Tyr9 and of GSH. Removal of the basic side-chain functionality as in mutant R15L causes an increase in the pK., value for the hydroxyl group of Tyr9 to 8.8 (Figure 3). When Arg15 was replaced by Lys, a residue with lower basicity than Arg, the pK., value of Tyr9 was increased to 8.5, i.e. 0.4 unit higher than in the wild-type enzyme. Mutant R15H, which contains an even weaker base in the G-site, displayed a pK, value for Tyr9 of 8.7. The pK, values determined spectrophotometrically (Figure 3) do not correspond directly to those determined from the kinetic data (Figure 2), even if the different graphs are shifted with pH in an analogous manner by the mutations. Thus, several ionizable groups contribute to the k~,,/K csH profile, including the sulfhydryl group of free GSH with a pK, value of 9.2. Similarly, Atkins et al. (1993), by difference spectroscopy, determined the pK, value of Tyr9 to be 8.3 to 8.5 in rat GST 1-1, a homologous class Alpha enzyme. More recently Wang et al. (1993) reported mutations R15K and R15I in rat GST 1-1. Their experimental results are fully consistent with our data on human GST AI-1, suggesting that Argl5 in the rat enzyme fulfills the same functions as in the human GST AI-1 and is hydrogen-bonded to the sulfur atom of GSH. With the exception of mutant R15H, the kinetic effects of substitutions are primarily linked to direct interactions between residues in the active site and

with the substrate GSH rather than to secondary effects caused by structural alterations of the protein, as indicated by additivity of the effects of the two substitutions seen in the double mutants. It is clear that the effects of a double mutation can be predicted, within experimental error, from the cumulative effects of single-point mutations. For example, k~.,/K coN" values and the relationship for incremental binding energy, AAG (Fersht, 1985):
A A G = - R T In[(kc,,/K.,)A/(k~,,/K°,)B]

(where A and B represent the two enzyme forms compared) allow the effect of the Arg15--, Lys mutation on the destabilization of the transition state to be calculated (Table 4). The corresponding effect of removal of the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr9 (mutant Y9F) can similarly be estimated. AAG for transition state destabilization in the double mutant Y9F,R15K was calculated to be 11.1 kJ mol-', while the sum of the Y9F and R15K mutants equals 13.8 kJ tool-1. Similar additivity is also noted for the specific activity values (Table 1), even though this is a composite parameter influenced by several rate constants. Thus, the specific activity of mutant Y9F is approximately 40-fold lower and that of mutant R15K threefold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. The combined effects of these mutations give a predicted 120-fold reduction in the specific activity for the double mutant Y9F,R15K, which should be compared to the 90-fold reduction observed for this mutant. Similar calculations can be performed for the mutants Y9F and R15A and the corresponding double mutant. The 40-fold reduction for Y9F and the 190-fold reduction for mutant R15A match the >5400-fold loss of activity for the double mutant Y9F,R15A found experimentally (Table 1). However, corresponding calculations for the R15H mutant do not show similar additivity of double substitutions, indicating that the His side-chain introduces novel interactions that are unfavorable for catalytic activity Introduction of a second mutation into mutant Y9F gives a further expected decrease in activity for mutant Y9F,R15H (20-fold). However, conversion of mutant R15H into mutant Y9F,R15H causes only twofold instead of the expected 40-fold reduction of activity (Table 1). We interpret these results as a structural change in the R15H mutant that removes most of the contribution of the Tyr9

In each case the bases changed from the normal GST A1 sequence are underlined. Clones with the required mutation were identified by sequencing. To express the modified protein, the cassette containing the mutated cDNA and the tac promoter was excised from the M13 replicative form with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated between the corresponding restriction sites in the vector pAT153 PvuII-8 (Stenberg et al., 1991b). Double mutants with modifications to Arg15 and Tyr9 were made with the oligonucleotides described above in an M13 singlestranded DNA template containing the Tyr9 ~ Phe mutation (Stenberg et al., 1991a).

hydroxyl to the catalytic function. The nature of this structural change is not known at present. Further support for a structural change caused by the R15H mutation is provided by the inhibition data presented in Table 3. Mutant R15H displays the highest I~ values and consequently appears to bind all of the inhibitors tested least strongly. Included are both glutathione derivatives (product analogs) and other commonly used GST inhibitors such as bromosulfophthalein and organotin compounds. The results of the inhibition studies support the interpretation that the hydrophobic substrate binding cavity has been altered by the different mutations of Arg15. The R15A mutation might lead to a less hydrophobic binding site, more accessible to solvent and hence with lower affinity for the inhibitors tested. Mutant R15K resembles the wild-type enzyme, but the K~ values for S-benzylglutathione and S-hexylglutathione are raised by a factor of 7.5 and 5.8, respectively. The properties of the R15L mutant indicate that the hydrophobic binding site is preserved. Thus, Arg15 via its side-chain helps to separate the H-site from solvent. The latter role has been implicated for Leu13 in the class M u GST 3-3 (Ji et al., 1992). An additional role of Arg15 is to form a hydrogen bond via its main-chain amide group, which interacts with the hydroxyl group of Tyr9. In conclusion, the catalytic mechanism of h u m a n glutathione transferase A1-1 involves contributions of both Tyr9 and Arg15, which both appear to stabilize the thiolate of GSH b y hydrogen bonding. An important role of Tyr9 has b e e n demonstrated (Stenberg et al., 1991a), but the present investigation extends the previous s t u d y by determination of the pK, value for this residue. The p H d e p e n d e n c e of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction suggests that the hydroxyl group of Tyr9 contributes to catalysis by providing the hydroxyl group in an undissociated form, rather than serving as a base (phenolate) abstracting a proton from the thiol group of glutathione. The same conclusion has been drawn for h u m a n glutathione transferase P1-1 (Kolm et al., 1992). The contributions provided by Arg15 involves not only hydrogen bonding to the sulfur atom of GSH, but the major contribution of Arg15 to catalysis is creation of an electrostatic potential in the G-site that favors ionization of e n z y m e - b o u n d GSH. The involvement of Arg15 in binding and activation of GSH is a feature that distinguishes class Alpha enzymes from the other k n o w n glutathione transferases.

Enzyme production and purification
Recombinant wild-type GST A1-1 and mutant forms were expressed in Escherichia coli JM103 as described in detail by Board & Pierce (1987) and Stenberg et al. (1991b). The wild-type enzyme and the R15A and R15H mutants as well as the Y9F,R15A mutant were purified from E. coli lysates by affinity chromatography on an S-hexylglutathione matrix (Mannervik & Guthenberg, 1981) followed by dialysis in 10 mM Tris-HC1, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.8). The R15K mutant, like the Y9F and R15L mutants as well as the double mutants Y9F,R15K and Y9F,R15H, showed poor binding to S-hexylglutathione and were purified on a glutathione affinity matrix (Simons & Vander Jagt, 1977) eluted with S-hexylglutathione. After elution the enzymes were dialyzed against the Tris buffer described above.

Enzyme assays
The specific activities of the purified enzymes were determined with three different substrates by spectrophotometric assays as described by Stenberg et al. (1991b). Conjugation activity was measured with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), and glutathione peroxidase activity was determined with cumene hydroperoxide. Isomerase activity was measured with AS-androstene-3,17-dione (Benson et al., 1977). All assays were carried out at 30°C.

Determination of kinetic constants and inhibition studies
The parameter k~.,,/Kmwas determined as v/[S][E],~ under first order conditions (low substrate concentration, IS]) with respect to the varied substrate. For determination of kco,/K~s" the CDNB concentration was fixed at 1.5 mM and for kc.,./KcDNB the GSH concentration was fixed at 2.5 mM. The kinetic parameters k~.,,and K~s" were obtained separately from the rate-saturation curves with [GSH] as the independent variable. The Michaelis-Menten equation was fitted to the experimental data by non-linear regression analysis using the SIMFIT package (Bardsley et al. 1989). The k~,, values were calculated on the basis of mol dimeric enzyme using a Mr of 50,850. Inhibition studies were carried out on a THERMOmax kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.), and I~ values were determined from plots of enzymatic activity (corrected for the non-enzymatic reaction) versus inhibitor concentration (Tahir & Mannervik, 1986). Serial dilutions of the inhibitors in the assay buffer (0.1 M sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA (pH 6.5)) were made in 96-well microtiter plates, and 1 mM GSH, enzyme, and finally I mM CDNB were added.

Methods
Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis
Mutagenesis of GST A1 cDNA was carried out largely as described by Stenberg et al. (1991b). Single-stranded DNA from the M13 clone mpTGT2 was used as a template and site-directed mutagenesis (Taylor et al., 1985) was made with specific oligonucleotides and a kit supplied by Amersham. The oligonucleotides used to create the mutations had the following sequences: R15A, 5'-

The enzymatic reactions were monitored for ten minutes at 340 nm. In some cases K. values were determined from experiments with varied substrate concentrations.

Determination of pK, for Tyr9
Direct measurement of the ionization of Tyr as a function of pH was made on a Varian 2090 spectrophotometer, using 0.1 M sodium phosphate of different pH values. Difference spectra were recorded with the sample in buffers in the pH range of 5.5 to 9.1, measured against the same protein at pH 5.5. The concentration of tyrosinate was calculated from the intrinsic absorbance at 293 nm using a ac of 2400 M -~ cm-' (Glazer, 1976). The concentration of GST A1 subunit (wild-type or mutant) ranged from 3 to 54 ~tM. Spectra of wild-type enzyme were also recorded in the presence of 2 mM GSH or 2 mM S-methylglutathione.
