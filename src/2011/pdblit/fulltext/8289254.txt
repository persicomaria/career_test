Abstract In the presence of ammonium sulfate the absorption spectra of a peroxidase from the fungus Arthromyces ramosus (ARP) showed that the low-spin component increased as the pH increased from 6.0 to 9.0, whereas in its absence ARP remained in the high-spin state in the pH range investigated. The crystal structure of ARP at pH 4.5 in the presence of ammonium sulfate at 1.8 A resolution showed that the electron density at the 6th position of the heine iron seen at pH 7.5 had disappeared and that the iron atom deviated markedly from the heme plane. These observations strongly suggest that under physiological conditions the heine of ARP is in the pentacoordinated high-spin state and that at a high pH the heine iron is able to bind ammonia, forming the low-spin state. The location of the water molecule at the distal side of the heme in peroxidases is also discussed.

I. Introduction
The fungus Arthromyces ramosus secretes a large amount of peroxidase [1], a heme-containing enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of a variety of substrates by utilizing hydrogen peroxide. Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase (ARP) gives a several hundred fold higher chemiluminescence in the oxidation of luminol than does horseradish peroxidase (HRP), therefore ARP has been suggested as useful for very sensitive assays of biological substances [2,3]. Sequence studies of the complementary and genomic clones encoding ARP [4] show that it is a class II peroxidase as are ligin peroxidase (LIP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) from the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium [5]. ARP has a single polypeptide protein of 344 residues, one iron protoporphyrin IX as a prosthetic group, two calcium ions, and carbohydrates attached to Asn-143 and Ser-339. ARP and the closely related Coprinus cinereus and Coprinus mac-

rorhizus peroxidases were characterized by Kjalke et al. [6]. Crystal structures of the native ARP, its cyanide- and triiodidebound forms, and C. cinereus peroxidase have been obtained at high resolution [7-9]. Spectroscopic studies suggest that under physiological conditions yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) and LiP in the resting state are predominantly in the pentacoordinate high-spin state but may convert to the high-spin hexacoordinate or to the low-spin state when the temperature or pH is lowered [10-13]. Crystallographic analyses of CcP, LiP, MnP, and ascorbate peroxidase have shown that the water molecule is located at the sixth coordination position of each heme [14-17]. In the case of ARP, structural analysis of crystals grown at pH 7.5 with ammonium sulfate as the precipitant showed significant electron density at the sixth coordination position of the heme [7]. Moreover, the color of the ARP crystals showed marked pH dependence, being reddish-brown at a high pH and brown at a low one. This indicates a coordination change of the ligand to the heme iron with pH change. The ligand of the ARP heme can not be assumed to be a water molecule because the interaction between water and the heme iron is known to be weak. To clarify the nature of the heme iron of ARP, we determined the crystal structure of ARP at pH 4.5 using diffraction data to 1.8 A resolution and examined the absorption spectra of ARP solutions. We report clear evidence that under physiological conditions the heme iron of ARP is pentacoordinated and in the high-spin state. On the basis of a structural comparison of peroxidases, we suggest that in peroxidases the water molecule is bound to the imidazole N, atom of the distal histidine rather than to the heine iron.

2. Experimental
2.1. Absorption spectra of ARP Absorption spectra of ARP solutions in the presence of 1.4 M ammonium sulfate, the same concentration as in the crystallization, and in its absence were measured at three pH values (6.0, 7.5, and 9.0), Spectra were recorded with a SHIMADZU UV-3101PC spectrophotometer. The buffers were 50 mM sodium succinate for pH 6.0, 50 mM Tris HC1 for pH 7.5, and 50 mM sodium borate for pH 9.0. The spectra are compared in Fig. 1. 2.2. Preparation of the low-pHform of ARP crystals ARP was purified and crystallized as described elsewhere [18J. The crystals belong to space group P422~2 with a = b = 74.57A and c = 117.47 A with one ARP molecule in the asymmetric unit. The low-pH form of the ARP crystal was prepared by soaking parent ARP crystals for 2 h in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer adjusted to pH 4.5 containing 35% saturated ammonium sulfate. Conversion of the form of the crystal could be monitored by the change in color from reddishbrown to brown and appeared to be completed within 1 h.

292 2.3. Data collection Diffraction data of the low pH form were collected to 1.8 A resolution at 20°C on a screenless Weissenberg camera for macromolecular crystals and using synchrotron radiation [19] at the BL6A2 of the Photon Factory, the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics. X-rays were focused with a cylindrical-bent asymmetric cut Si(111) monochromator. The wavelength was 1.00 A., and the collimator had a diameter of 0.1 ram. The radius of the film cassette, which contained a Fuji Imaging Plate (IP) with a detection area of 40 cm × 20 cm, was 286.5 mm. The crystal was oscillated around the a+b axis. The oscillation angle and coupling constant for each IP respectively were 4.5 to 5.2 ° and 1.5 to 1.8°/mm, in order to minimize the overlapping of diffraction spots. The overlap angle between adjacent IPs was 0.2 °. The low pH form was stable to X-rays, and intensity data were collected for one crystal. Diffraction data recorded on each IP were read out at 100 /tm intervals using a Fuji BAI00 then processed with the program system WEIS [20] and PROTEIN [21]. Partial reflections were discarded. Data collection results are shown in Table 1A. 2.4. Structure determination The atomic parameters of ARP at pH 7.5 refined at 1.9/k resolution (PDB code 1ARP) were used to start the structural refinement, several water molecules near the heme being excluded. The model was refined by simulated annealing using the program XPLOR [22]. The protein model and locations of the water molecules were revised using 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps with FRODO [23,24] and an IRIS 4D/35GT computer graphics system. The final model contains 285 water molecules in addition to the protein. The final crystallographic R-factor was 18.8% for 27,884 reflections with F > 2ae in the 7.0-1.8 ,~ resolution range. Refinement results are shown in Table lB. The mean coordinate error is estimated to be about 0.2 A from a Luzatti plot [25]. The atomic parameters will be deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Chemistry Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY.

cule shows little change, whereas the solvent molecules around the distal side of the heme show marked rearrangement. Electron density, clearly seen at the sixth position of the heme iron at pH 7.5 [7], is absent in the low pH form. The heme iron of ARP at a low pH has typical pentacoordinated geometry. The distance from the heme iron to the nearest solvent molecule is 3.9 A, too far to form a bond ~. These results together with the present absorption spectroscopic data indicate that the sixth coordination position of the heme iron is occupied by ammonia when the pH is high. Moreover, the displacement of the iron atom from the heme plane is 0.19/k at pH 4.5, whereas it is 0.07 /k at pH 7.5, indicative that lowering the pH increases the component of the high-spin state 2. The structure at pH 4.5 presented here may represent the physiological form of the resting enzyme and is the first example of a peroxidase with a typical pentacoordinated heine iron demonstrated by crystallography. This is consistent with the resonance Raman and N M R studies done on C. einereus peroxidase which showed that at a neutral pH the ferric state is characteristic of a fivecoordinated high-spin heme [26,27]. In CcP, LiP, MnP, and ascorbate peroxidase, a water molecule occupies the 6th position of each heme [14-17]. The geometries around that water molecule are compared in Table 2. The molecule lies at a position suitable for hydrogen bonding with the N, of the distal histidine. In each peroxidase the distance between N, and the water molecule is in the range of hydrogen bonding and the bond approximately bisects the Cs-N,-C, angle. Moreover, the water molecule is approximately in the plane of the imidazole ring, which is consistent with the descrip~In our attempt to prepare compound I of ARP, a crystal free of ammonium sulfate was obtained by soaking the parent crystal in 25 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.0 that contained saturated sodium sulfate and 3 mM HzO2. The structure was refined to R = 16.4% using 17,721 diffraction data to 2 ,~ resolution measured as described for the low pH form. ARP was not converted to compound I. There was no water molecule that is close enough to form a bond to the heme iron. 2High resolution X-ray analyses of the cyanide and triiodide complexes of ARP clearly showed that displacement of the iron atom from the heme plane is correlated to the spin-state. In the low-spin cyanide complex the iron lies in the heme plane, whereas in the high-spin triiodide complex it deviates from the plane by 0.17/~ [8].

tion of Thanki et al. obtained from an analysis of the distributions of water molecules around amino acid residues [28]. In brief, the position of the water molecule on the distal side of the heme in peroxidases appears to be dominated by the orientation of the imidazole ring rather than by interaction with the heme. The different orientation of the imidazole ring in ARP [7,8] causes marked deviation of the water molecule from the 6th position of the heme. Generally in peroxidases the interaction between the water molecule and the heme iron appears to be weak, which is consistent with the spectroscopic evidence for CcP [10,11] and LiP [12,13]. The heine iron of H RP was shown to be pentacoordinated by EPR [29] and by Raman spectroscopy [30], but the detailed crystal structure of HRP has yet to be determined. Quillin et al. obtained the crystal structures of distal histidine mutants of sperm whale myoglobin in which rnetmyoglobins with hydrophobic substitutions at residue 64 lack a water mol-
