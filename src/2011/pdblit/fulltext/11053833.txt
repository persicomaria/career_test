Structure of XynB, a highly thermostable b-1,4-xylanase from Dictyoglomus thermophilum Ê Rt46B.1, at 1.8 A resolution
Microorganisms employ a large array of enzymes to break down the cellulose and hemicelluloses of plant biomass. These enzymes, especially those with high thermal stability, have many uses in biotechnology. We have solved the crystal structure of a -1,4-xylanase, XynB, from the extremely thermophilic bacterium Dictyoglomus thermophilum, isolate Rt46B.1. The protein crystallized from 1.6 M ammonium sulfate, 0.2 M HEPES pH 7.2 and 10% glycerol, with unit-cell Ê parameters a = b = 91.3, c = 44.9 A and space group P43. The Ê structure was solved at high resolution (1.8 A) by X-ray crystallography, using the method of isomorphous replacement with a single mercury derivative, and re®ned to a ®nal R factor of 18.3% (Rfree = 22.1%). XynB has the single-domain fold typical of family 11 xylanases, comprising a jelly roll of two highly twisted -sheets that create a deep substratebinding cleft. The two catalytic residues, Glu90 and Glu180, occupy this cleft. Compared with other family 11 xylanases, XynB has a greater proportion of polar surface and has a slightly extended C-terminus that, combined with the extension of -strand A5, gives additional hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic packing. These factors may account for the enhanced thermal stability of the enzyme.

1. Introduction
Cellulose and hemicelluloses are complex polysaccharides, the main components of plant biomass and the largest source of carbon in Nature. Microbes have evolved to utilize this carbon source and secrete many different speci®c enzymes which function synergistically in the breakdown of cellulose and hemicelluloses. These glycosyl hydrolases can be classi®ed into a total of 45 families, including 11 1,4-glycosidase families, on the basis of sequence similarity (Henrissat, 1991; Henrissat & Bairoch, 1993). Many three-dimensional structures of glycosyl hydrolases have been determined, revealing different folds and signi®cant variations in the active-site construction among enzymes from different families (Davies & Henrissat, 1995). Xylan is a hemicellulose composed of a 1,4--linked xylopyranoside backbone with varied branched heteropolysaccharides depending on its botanical origin. The enzymes acting on the backbone of xylans are endo-1,4-xylanases (E.C. 3.2.1.8), capable of hydrolysing the internal 1,4--bonds of xylan, and exo-1,4--xylosidases (E.C. 3.2.1.37), which prefer to hydrolyse the 1,4-glycosidic linkages from the ends of the polymeric chain. The enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan has drawn commercial interest because of potential industrial applications, for example in animal feeds and in the pulp-bleaching process, where xylanases hold the

promise of reducing the amount of chlorine toxins released (Viikari et al., 1994). Thus, research in this area has focused both on identifying new xylanases and improving the thermostability of others to withstand the harsh environment involved in pulp bio-bleaching or in the pelleting process for animal feeds. The xylanases that have been characterized to date fall into two structural families, F and G, corresponding to families 10 and 11 in the numerical classi®cation of glycosyl hydrolases. Family 10 xylanases have a molecular mass of about 35 kDa and have been shown to have the (/)8 or TIM-barrel fold (Davies & Henrissat, 1995; Harris et al., 1994). Family 11 xylanases are smaller, about 20 kDa, with a single-domain structure based on two highly twisted -sheets that pack against each other and curve around to create a large substrate-binding cleft. The overall shape has been compared È È to the shape of a right hand (Torronen et al., 1994) and has the same `jelly-roll' -barrel topology as the plant lectins (Keitel et al., 1993). Glycosidases may have two alternative enzymatic mechanisms of glycosidic bond cleavage, depending on whether there is a net retention or inversion of the anomeric con®guration (McCarter & Withers, 1994). The family 11 xylanases have a retaining mechanism (Gebler et al., 1992) and contain a pair of carboxylic acids at the active site. One, with the lower pKa, functions as a nucleophile, whereas the other acts as a general acid/base in a double-displacement mechanism (McCarter & Withers, 1994) and has been shown to cycle over a pKa range of 2.5 during catalysis (McIntosh et al., 1996). A sequenceconserved arginine in the vicinity of the active site has been proposed to lower the pKa of the nucleophile (Wakarchuk, Campbell et al., 1994). The family 11 xylanases can be further classi®ed in terms of their pH optimum. A mutation of an asparagine to an aspartate at the active site is believed to account for the shift to a lower pH optimum (Krengel & Dijkstra, 1996). Three-dimensional structures have been determined for the catalytic domains of a number of family 11 xylanases from both fungi and bacteria. These include enzymes from Bacillus circulans (Campbell et al., 1993; Wakarchuk, Campbell et al., 1994; Sidhu et al., 1999), Trichoderma harzianum (Campbell et È È È È al., 1993), Trichoderma reesei (Torronen et al., 1994; Torronen & Rouvinen, 1995), Aspergillus niger (Krengel & Dijkstra, 1996), Bacillus agaradhaerens (Sabini et al., 1999), Paecilomyces varioti Bainier (Kumar et al., 2000) and Thermomyces lanuginosus (Gruber et al., 1998). These enzymes differ in detail in their enzymatic properties and in their thermal stability. Notably, two of them, the enzymes from P. varioti and T. lanuginosus, are thermophilic, the latter having an optimum temperature for activity of 343 K. Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of a family 11 xylanase from Dictyoglomus thermophilum isolate Ê Rt46B.1 determined by X-ray crystallography at 1.8 A resolution. D. thermophilum Rt46B.1 is an extremely thermophilic strictly anaerobic bacterium that produces both family 10 and family 11 xylanases that act over a broad pH range (pH 5.5± 9.0) at 353 K. Several variants of the family 11 xylanase from this organism have been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (Morris et al., 1998). The variant we have analysed is XynB3; this variant has 199 amino-acid residues and the N-terminal sequence ALTSNA. It lacks the normal leader sequence, whose removal gave higher expression levels in E. coli and it also lacks the C-terminal non-catalytic domain which reduces thermostability (Morris et al., 1998). XynB3 has a pH optimum of 6.5 and a temperature optimum of 348 K and retains 90% of its activity after heating at 353 K for 8 h. This is the most thermostable xylanase yet to be characterized structurally and allows us to draw comparisons between mesophilic and thermophilic xylanases of this family.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Crystallization and data collection

Expression and puri®cation of the -1,4-xylanase XynB from D. thermophilum was carried out as described previously (Morris et al., 1998). Good-quality crystals were obtained at 291 K by vapour diffusion in hanging drops from a solution containing 10 mg mlÀ1 protein, 1.5±1.6 M ammonium sulfate, 0.2 M HEPES buffer at pH 7.2 and 10% glycerol. The crystals, which required approximately two weeks to grow to maximal size, were tetragonal, space group P43, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and a solvent content of approximately 45%. Room-temperature data from native and derivative crystals were collected with a MAR Research MAR345 imaging-plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 X-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA equipped with a Ê copper anode (! = 1.54 A) and Franck's double focusing Ê mirrors. A second native data set to 1.8 A was also collected at Ê 110 K, using synchrotron radiation (wavelength 1.08 A) on beamline 7.1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory; the crystal was ¯ash-frozen after being soaked for 30 s in a cryo-protectant consisting of 1.7 M ammonium sulfate, 0.2 M HEPES buffer pH 7.2 and 20% glycerol. All data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Table 1 contains a summary of the data collection and processing.
2.2. Phasing

The structure was solved using the SIRAS method. A single mercury derivative was prepared by soaking crystals in standard mother liquor (1.7 M ammonium sulfate, 0.2 M HEPES buffer pH 7.2 and 10% glycerol) containing 50 mM Hg(CH3COO)2. The isomorphous difference Patterson map, calculated from native and derivative room-temperature data, was solved both manually and using the Patterson heavy-atom search method implemented in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). Only two sites could be located and no further sites were found in difference Fourier maps. These sites and their enantiomorph were re®ned and phases were calculated using MLPHARE (Otwinowski, 1991) from the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Choice of the correct enantiomorph was made by inspecting the Rfree output on solvent ¯attening with DM (Cowtan &

unit occupancy. In addition, the solvent molecules were visually inspected and were deleted from the model if they were not within hydrogen-bonding distance of one or more potential hydrogen-bond partners or were close to regions in which the protein density was ambiguous. The ®nal re®nement was performed with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) with a bulksolvent correction. Re®nement details are summarized in Table 2.
2.5. Quality of the final model

The program wARP (Perrakis et al., 1997; van Asselt et al., 1998) was used for accelerated structure elucidation. The Ê solvent-¯attened phases to 2.3 A were improved and extended Ê using the procedures in wARP; automatic tracing and to 2.0 A model building into the electron-density map located 260 residues. This initial model allowed the identi®cation of the NCS operator. The initial phases from SHARP (de La Fortelle & Bricogne, 1997) were then solvent ¯attened and averaged using DM (Cowtan & Main, 1998). The new phases were again input into wARP (Perrakis et al., 1997) as described above and resulted in an initial model of 170 residues for one of the molecules in the asymmetric unit.
2.4. Model building and refinement

Further model building was performed with the interactive graphics program O (Jones et al., 1991). The quality of the wARP (Perrakis et al., 1997) map and the initial model allowed the remainder of the structure to be built without dif®culty. This initial room-temperature model was then positioned in Ê the 110 K cell with AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) and the 1.8 A synchrotron data set was used for all subsequent re®nement. Re®nement was carried out using the maximum-likelihood target with bulk-solvent correction in REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) and medium main-chain/side-chain NCS restraints. The re®nement was guided by monitoring the free R factor calculated with 10% of the data excluded from the re®nement È (Brunger, 1992). Potential solvent molecules were located with the building of the solvent structure method in wARP (Perrakis et al., 1997). All solvent molecules were re®ned with
Acta Cryst. (2000). D56, 1367±1375

The ®nal model comprises all 199 residues for both molecules (labelled A and B) in the asymmetric unit, together with 295 water molecules and two sulfate ions. This model gives an Ê R factor of 18.3% for all data to 1.8 A resolution (no '-cutoff) and a free R (for 10% of data) of 22.1%. The protein molecules conform closely to standard bond lengths and angles as de®ned by Engh & Huber (1991), with root-mean-square Ê (r.m.s.) deviations of 0.006 A and 1.5 , respectively. A Ramachandran plot for the main-chain dihedral angles showed that 87.9% of all the residues (excluding glycine) have dihedral angles that fall in the most favoured regions as de®ned by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). There are no outliers. Two cis-proline residues are found in the structure, Pro87 and Pro103. Residues Thr21A, Ser35A, Ser67A, Ser150A, Thr21B, Thr69B, Ser146B and Ser150B were modelled in two alternate side-chain conformations. The Tyr52±Asn53 peptide bond was also modelled in two alternate conformations for molecule B, though not for molecule A, which is stabilized by crystal packing contacts in this region.
2.6. Analysis of the model

Hydrogen bonds in the structures of XynB and other family 11 xylanases were identi®ed using the criteria of Baker & Hubbard (1984), after ®rst checking Asn, Gln and His residues for the correct side-chain orientation (McDonald & Thornton, 1994). Ion pairs were inferred where the distance between Ê potentially oppositely charged atoms was less than 4.0 A (Barlow & Thornton, 1983), but with the following proviso. Where two hydrogen bonds were made between partners in an ionic interaction (e.g. between N4 and N2 atoms of arginine and the O41 and O42 atoms of glutamate) this was treated as

two ion pairs, whereas when only a single hydrogen bond in an ion-pair interaction was possible it was treated as one. Calculations of solvent-accessible surface were made with AREAIMOL (Collaborative Computational Project, Number Ê 4, 1994) using a 1.4 A radius probe. Multiple structural superpositions were performed with the program MAPS (Lu, 1998). This method uses the algorithm TOP (Lu, 1996) to perform a structural alignment for each pair of proteins and calculates pairwise structural diversity scores which are rootmean-square differences in C positions normalized by the number of atom equivalences relative to the average number in the family. whole folds back against the body of the molecule, burying several hydrophobic residues including Tyr52, Trp56, Leu59 and Ile62. The -sheet hydrogen bonding between strands A5 and A4 (the C-terminal strand) is also extended, as the B3±A5

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Overall structure

XynB from D. thermophilum Rt46B.1 is folded into a single domain based on two -sheets that pack against one another. The smaller sheet A comprises ®ve antiparallel strands, A2±A6, and the larger sheet B comprises nine mostly antiparallel strands, B1±B9. Sheet B curves around to create a large cleft where the xylan substrate binds and the catalytic pair Glu90 and Glu180 are located. A single -helix, residues 155±166 in XynB, packs against sheet B at the back of the molecule. This fold, shown in Fig. 1, is characteristic of the È È family 11 xylanases and has been likened by Torronen et al. (1994) to a hand in which the two -sheets and the -helix form the `®ngers' and `palm' and a loop at the end of the extended strands B7 and B8 forms a `thumb' that helps to enclose the active-site cleft. The main structural deviation seen in this family is that some members, the xylanase from B. circulans (Campbell et al., 1993), xylanase I from Tr. reesei È È (Torronen & Rouvinen, 1995) and xylanase I from A. niger (Krengel & Dijkstra, 1996), lack the ®rst strand B1 of sheet B and are thus slightly smaller in size. A multiple sequence alignment of XynB with six other family 11 xylanases, including the thermophilic xylanases from P. varioti and T. lanuginosus, is given in Fig. 2. All of these enzymes share substantial sequence identity that ranges from 46 to 62% pairwise identity, except for the P. varioti/T. lanuginosus and Tr. harzianum/Tr. reesei II pairs, which have around 90% identity (Table 3). We have further used the program MAPS (see x2.6) to carry out a multiple structure alignment of XynB with these other family 11 xylanases. All of them can be aligned structurally over nearly 90% of C atoms Ê with a 3.0 A cutoff. Root-mean-square differences in C positions between XynB and the other enzymes are all in the Ê range 1.0±1.2 A. When the structure diversity scores calculated by MAPS are compared, however, it is clear that XynB groups most closely with the xylanases from P. varioti, T. lanuginosus (both thermostable) and Tr. harzianum. The largest difference between XynB and the other family 11 xylanase structures occurs in the loop connecting strand B3 to strand A5. An insertion of ®ve extra residues in this loop in XynB causes residues 52±61 to take on a different conformation; residues 55±59 form a 310-helix and the loop as a

Glu180. For glycosidases with a retaining mechanism, the distance between the carboxyl groups (de®ned as the mean Ê separation of the carboxylic atoms) is usually around 5.5 A. Ê The distance between Glu90 and Glu180 in XynB is 6.5 A, similar to the potential `active conformation' observed in the Ê Ê xylanases from B. circulans (5.9 A), Tr. reesei I (6.7 A) and Tr. Ê ) and shorter than for the T. lanuginosus harzianum (6.4 A Ê Ê (10.7 A) and Tr. reesei II (10.9 A) enzymes; in the latter, a conformational change is expected to generate an active species. We conclude, therefore, that Glu90 and Glu180 in 3.2. Active site XynB are in their active conformation. In general, the structure and interactions in the XynB active By analogy with the other family 11 xylanases, the two site match the other family 11 xylanases very closely. Glu90 is catalytic acid groups in XynB are provided by Glu90 and hydrogen bonded to Tyr81 through one carboxyl O atom and to Gln139 through the other, and Glu180 is hydrogen bonded to Tyr92 through one carboxyl O atom and to Asn43 through the other. All these interactions involve residues that are fully conserved in other xylanases, except for Asn43, which varies to Asp in enzymes with a low pH optimum (Krengel & Dijkstra, 1996). The guanidinium group of Arg125 is close enough to maintain a low pKa for Glu90, as proposed. The distance between the guanidinium and carboxyl groups varies in different xylanase structures, however, and in Ê Ê XynB is 5 A in molecule A and 6.5 A in molecule B (measured between the 90 C and 125 C atoms). This ¯exibility implies that the role that Arg125 plays in activity may depend on the repositioning of this residue after the substrate has bound. Superposition of XynB on to the substrate complexes of B. circulans xylanase (Sidhu et al., 1999) and B. agaradhaerens xylanase (Sabini et al., 1999) appears to con®rm this. The position the guanidinium group of Arg125 adopts in XynB would clash with the À1 subsite sugar and in both complexes the corresponding side chains are slightly displaced in order to hydrogen bond to the sugar. Other active-site residues in XynB correspond remarkably closely in both position and orientation with the residues that contact the substrate Figure 2 sugar rings in the B. circulans and B.

A further difference is in the extended nine-residue loop, 98±106, that closes the È È cleft on one side, described as a `cord' by Torronen et al. (1994). This loop is one residue shorter in XynB and also contains a cis-proline at Pro103.

the B. agaradhaerens complex (Sabini et al., 1999) as a reference, these residues include in XynB Trp18, equivalent to Trp19, which stacks against the À2 subsite sugar ring in the complex; Glu16, Arg47 and Tyr81, equivalent to Glu17, Arg49 and Tyr85, which hydrogen bond to the À2 sugar hydroxyl groups in the complex; Leu45, equivalent to Leu47, which makes close van der Waals contacts with the sugar and may play a role in determining xylose sugar speci®city; Trp83, Pro129 and Phe137, equivalent to Trp87, Pro133 and Phe141, which complete the de®nition of the binding site in the complex. Most of these residues are conserved in other xylanases, although Arg47 is usually a glycine and its role in

Several of the other family 11 xylanases contain disul®de bonds. In the thermostable xylanases from P. varioti (Kumar et al., 2000) and T. lanuginosus (Gruber et al., 1998), a disul®de bond 110±154 connects the C-terminal end of strand B9 to the N-terminus of the -helix and this has been correlated 57 with their enhanced stability. In A. niger xylanase I (Krengel & Dijkstra, 1996), a disul®de bond 92±111 joins the cord to strand B8. In contrast, in XynB there are three Cys residues, Cys36, Cys79 and Cys178, but no disul®de bond is formed. Curiously, Cys79 and Cys178, which are on adjacent -strands, B5 and B4, in the active-site region, appear close enough to form a disul®de, but the electron density shows clearly that they do not (Fig. 3); instead, both sulfhydryl groups hydrogen bond to carbonyl O atoms, of residues 178 and 46, respectively. The distance between their Ê C atoms is 5.2 A, within the range found for other disul®de bonds (Thornton, 1981), and a change in the rotamer for Ê Cys178 would bring the two S atoms within 2.5 A. It may be the constraints of the -structure that prevents disul®de formation, however, and Thornton's analysis (Thornton, 1981) shows that disul®de bonds occur relatively infrequently where both Cys residues have a  conformation. In the present case, disul®de-bond formation would require some main-chain adjustment to bring the S atoms close enough in a favourable geometry and this could disrupt the mutual hydrogen bonding between the mainchain C O and NH groups of Cys79 and Cys178. The third cysteine residue, Cys36, is buried and makes only non-bonded contacts with other residues; it is replaced by hydrophobic residues in other xylanases.

Two sulfate ions have been located in the crystal structure, both associated with the side chain of Arg165 in the active-site Tyr118 and His158 in the interface between the cord, the cleft of molecule B, but they do not seem likely to have any B8±B9 loop and the -helix. This water molecule is conserved functional signi®cance. in all family 11 xylanases so far analysed and appears to make an important contribution to structure and stability (Kumar et al., 2000). 3.5. Thermostability None of the other buried waters are similarly conserved, although one (W6 molecule A, W9 molecule B) is present in Various factors have been identi®ed as contributing to all except the Tr. reesei xylanase I; this water molecule is in a enhanced protein thermostability (Vogt et al., 1997; Wallon et crevice between the A5±B5 loop and the B6±cord connection, al., 1997; Knapp et al., 1997). These include speci®c features bound in XynB to Asn75 O1, 76 N, 100 N and 100 O. The such as additional disul®de bonds, metal binding, enhanced other buried waters are more speci®c to XynB, mostly occuhydrogen bonding, increased numbers of ion pairs, oligomerpying crevices close to the surface and tying together the ization, shortened loops and shortened or protected N- and C-termini and an increased fraction of polar surface. Compositional factors such as more proline residues or fewer glycine residues, an increased Arg/Lys ratio or decreased numbers of residues prone to chemical change (Asn, Gln, Cys) may also contribute. The energy difference between mesophilic and thermophilic proteins is very small, however, and different factors evidently operate in different proteins. In the family 11 xylanases an additional disul®de bridge, 110±154, has been associated with the enhanced thermostability of the enzymes from T. lanuginosus (Gruber et al., 1998) and P. varioti (Kumar et al., 2000). This disul®de links strand B9 to the -helix in the hinge region at the back of the molecule (Fig. 4) and it is suggested that enhanced interactions in this region, Figure 4 Stereo diagram showing the structure in the vicinity of the insertion in the B3±A5 loop in XynB including also some speci®c hydrogen from D. thermophilum.

In contrast, in the P. varioti xylanase (gold) and B. circulans XynB is the most thermostable xylanase xylanase (green) xylanases, the loop is ®ve residues shorter and includes several exposed yet to be structurally characterized, having a hydrophobic residues (not shown). The disul®de bond 110±154, which links the helix to strand temperature optimum of 348 K (Morris et B9 in the P. varioti xylanase and has been associated with enhanced thermostability, is also shown (yellow spheres). al., 1998) compared with 343 K for T.

lanuginosus xylanase (Gruber et al., 1998). We can identify several factors that may be responsible for its increased thermostability. Firstly, the percentage of solvent-accessible surface that is polar, calculated using GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991), is signi®cantly higher than in the other xylanases; for XynB the surface is 83% polar, compared with 78% for B. circulans xylanase and 73±75% for all the others (Table 4). An increased proportion of polar surface (and corresponding decrease in exposed hydrophobic surface) correlates strongly with increased thermostability (Vogt et al., 1997) and the ®gure of 83% for XynB is similar to that found for highly thermostable enzymes of the subtilisin family (Smith et al., 1999). Secondly, the altered B3±A5 connecting loop and the associated extended C-terminus, shown in Fig. 4, seem likely to provide a local contribution to the increased thermostability. In contrast to the other family 11 xylanases, in XynB this loop is ®ve residues longer and contains a short 310-helix that tucks back in to pack against the -helix and side chains from strands A5 and B4. This produces new hydrophobic interactions; Leu59 and Ile62 from the B3±A5 loop are buried, packing against Tyr52, Val155, Phe159, Ile175 and Phe195, and Trp56 at the centre of the loop is partially buried and contacts Phe159, Leu169 and Ile177, effectively closing off this extended hydrophobic core. Phe195 from the extended C-terminus also tucks into this hydrophobic core, in a position occupied by the side chain of a Trp residue in other xylanases (Trp42 in B. circulans xylanase). This may help to tie down the C-terminal strand. In contrast to XynB, the shorter B3±A5 loop in other xylanases leaves several hydrophobic side chains exposed; for example, Pro47 and Phe48 in B. circulans xylanase and Pro53 and Leu55 in P. varioti xylanase. The larger B3±A5 loop also results in enhanced hydrogen bonding, both through the formation of the 310-helix 55±59 and because of increased -sheet hydrogen bonding. Residues 61±64 from the B3±A5 loop hydrogen bond with residues 196±198 of the extended C-terminal strand A4 on one side and with the slightly extended strand A6 on the other. The result is that the B3±A5 loop in XynB makes 34 hydrogen bonds, compared with 20 for the corresponding loop in B. circulans xylanase. Extended hydrogen bonding may also explain the even higher thermostability of another variant of XynB. This variant, XynB6, has an N-terminal extension of six residues (Morris et al., 1998), which may extend the -sheet structure of the molecule. Local structural changes can enhance thermostability, particularly if the region is a potential `hot-spot' that may nucleate unfolding or increase ¯exibility. In the family 11 xylanases, the B3±A5 loop, implicated here in the increased thermostability of XynB, and the disul®de bridge 110±154, implicated in the thermostability of the T. lanuginosus and P. varioti enzymes, are both close to the hinge region at the back of the molecule. This seems likely to be a critical `hot-spot' in unfolding. Indeed, engineered disu®de bridges in this region of the B. circulans xylanase have been shown to enhance thermostability by up to 15 (Wakarchuk, Sung et al., 1994). In most other respects, XynB resembles the other family 11 xylanases. The number of ion pairs de®ned with a distance Ê cutoff of 4.0 A (Barlow & Thornton, 1983) is similar in all the proteins. The numbers of hydrogen bonds de®ned using the criteria of Baker & Hubbard (1984) are also similar, although XynB does have slightly more hydrogen bonds in total than any of the other proteins, in addition to the local increase noted above. XynB also has signi®cantly fewer glycine residues than the others (19 compared with 25±30 in most of the others), but similar numbers of Pro, Asn, Gln and aromatic residues and no signi®cant difference in the ratio of Arg/Lys. A curious feature is that XynB alone in this family of xylanases has three unpaired Cys residues. This might be expected to decrease thermostability because of their susceptibility to oxidation, but we assume that their burial in XynB militates against this.
