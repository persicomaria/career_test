ABSTRACT UPF0040 is a family of proteins implicated in a cellular function of bacteria cell division. There is no structure information available on protein of this family. We have determined the crystal structure of a protein from Mycoplasma pneumoniae that belongs to this family using X-ray crystallography. Structural homology search reveals that this protein has a novel fold with no significant similarity to any proteins of known threedimensional structure. The crystal structures of the protein in three different crystal forms reveal that the protein exists as a ring of octamer. The conserved protein residues, including a highly conserved DXXXR motif, are examined on the basis of crystal structure. Proteins 2004;55:785­791.

Key words: cell division; UPF0040 family; novel fold; structural genomics; GI 13508053 INTRODUCTION As part of NIH's Protein Structure Initiative (PSI), the Berkeley Structural Genomics Center (BSGC) has set out to obtain a near complete structural complement of a minimal organism, Mycoplasma genitalium (Mg), and its closely related organism, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp), two organisms with the smallest genomes (about 480 and 680 genes, respectively) sequenced so far. Since about half of the Mp genes have sequence homologs among protein structures deposited in Protein Data Bank,1 the major effort of BSGC is directed in discovering new and novel protein folds from these organisms. Therefore, most of the BSGC target proteins are hypothetical proteins, those with unknown functions and structures. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of a hypothetical protein from Mycoplasma pneumoniae, MPN314, (gi 13508053). MPN314 contains two homologous copies of UPF0040 (Pfam2), a bacterial protein sequence family with unknown protein function. This protein has many sequence homologs in various bacterial organisms, all of which are also hypothetical proteins. MPN314 is the first three©

dimensional structure determined for the UPF0040 family. Although the molecular (biochemical and biophysical) function of MPN314 is not known, gene clustering analysis and transcription analysis of inter-genic regions (Gwynedd Smith and Clyde Hutchison, unpublished results) show that MPN314 is the first gene of a polycistronic gene cluster, and genes in the clusters are associated with cell division in Mycopolasma, suggesting that the cellular function for MPN314 is cell division. This is further supported by the observation that the open reading frame coding for the UPF0040 family is found at the beginning of gene clusters associated with cell division and cell wall biosynthesis (dcw cluster).3­ 4 This open reading frame is conserved in all or most of bacteria (Fig. 1; generated using STRING database.).5 Each gene in this figure is represented using COG6 (Cluster of Orthologous Groups) ID. UPF0040 is represented by red arrows and the corresponding COG ID is COG2001. Associated genes in this cluster are also listed in the figure. There are conflicting observations about the essentiality of this gene in bacteria. This gene is an essential gene in Mycoplasma genitalium as assayed by global transposon mutagenesis.7 YabB, the ORF coding for UPF0040 protein in Escherichia coli, has also been reported as essential in several studies,8 ­9 but not in other studies.10 ­11 ORF Yllb coding for UPF0040 in Bacillus subtilis has been shown to be nonessential.12 A PSI-PHI BLAST search with the protein sequence of MPN314 reveals there are 20 full-length sequence homologues with sequence identity ranging from 81% to 29% and E-value below 6E-12 (Fig. 2). All of these homologues are composed of two repeating 70-residue UPF0040 motifs (Fig. 2). There are many residues that are highly conserved (Fig. 2). None of these sequence homologs have

METHODS AND MATERIALS Cloning Primers (Operon, Emeriville, CA) for PCR amplification contained an NdeI restriction site in the forward primer (5 -CATATGCTTTTAGGAACCTTCAACATTAC) and BamHI site in the reverse primer (5 -GGATCCTTACTTAACATCTTTCATCCTTTCCG). PCR was performed using Deep Vent Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae genomic DNA. The PCR product was cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO

vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) and the MPN314 gene insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The amplified TOPO vector was restricted with NdeI and BamHI and the gene insert was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis extraction. This insert was ligated into pSKB3 (gift from Steve Burley, Rockefeller University, New York) digested with NdeI and BamHI and transformed into DH5 . A plasmid containing the gene insert was confirmed and then transformed into BL21(DE3)pSJS1244.13 Protein Expression and Purification His-tagged protein MPN314 was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/pSJS124413 cells upon induction with

0.5 mM isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside. Selenomethionyl (Se-Met) protein was prepared according to the method of Doublie.14 Bacteria were lysed by sonication in Buffer A (50mM Hepes, pH 7, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1 ug/ml antipain, 1 ug/ml chymostatin, 0.5 ug/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 ug/ml pepstatin A) and cell debris pelleted by centrifugation at 39,000 g for 20 min in a Sorvall centrifuge. The lysate was then spun in a Beckman ultracentrifuge Ti45 rotor at 60,000 g for 20 min at 4C to remove membrane proteins. The His-tagged MPN314 protein was affinity purified from the soluble fraction using Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer, elution was achieved with 300 mM imidazole. The eluted sample was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA. The target protein was bound onto a 5 ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and eluted with a 20 column volume linear gradient from 0 to 0.4 M NaCl in the same buffer. The purity of the expressed protein was determined by SDS gel electrophoresis and electrospray mass spectrometry. The protein was concentrated in 20 mM Tris HCl,

pH 8.5, 1 mM EDTA to 19 to 28 mg/ml for crystallization screening. Crystallization Crystallization conditions were screened with a sparse matrix sampling method15 using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique at room temperature with commercially prepared reagents (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA). Three crystal forms, monoclinic, orthorhombic, and tetragonal, were obtained and they were flashfrozen in loops at 100 °K prior to diffraction data collection. Monoclinic crystals were grown at 20 °C in a solution containing 28 mg/ml protein, 0.2 M Li2SO4, 0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 8.5, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 20% glycerol. Orthorhombic crystals were grown at 20°C in a solution containing 19 mg/ml protein, 0.2 M Mg Acetate, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 10% glycerol. Tetragonal crystals were also grown at 20°C in a solution containing 19 mg/ml protein, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.2 M Li2SO4, 0.1 M Tris HCl, pH 8.5, 18% (w/v) PEG 3350, 20% glycerol. Structure Solution and Refinement For monoclinic crystals, single anomalous dispersion (SAD) data set at the selenium absorption edge was collected at the ALS beam line 502 using the ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector placed 180 mm from the sample. The SAD data were processed using the programs HKL2000 and SCALEPACK.16 X-ray data statistics are shown in Table 1. The 16 Se sites were located using CNS.17 Phases were subject to 8 cycles of refinement and solvent flattening18 followed by an 8-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging using program CNS.17 The figure of merit (FOM) after NCS averaging achieved 0.94 overall and 0.85 in the 2.7 Å resolution shell. The model building was performed using O.19 The initial model was traced in the 2.7 Å NCS averaged experimental map

derived from a partially refined model of MPN314 in the monoclinic crystal form by molecular replacement method using AMORE.20 The models in both crystal forms were then refined to 2.8 Å using CNS.17 Relaxed NCS restraints were used during the refinement. Ten percent of the data were randomly picked out for free R factor cross validation. The refinement statistics are shown in Table 2. Atomic coordinates have been deposited at the protein data bank with access code 1N0F and 1N0G for the structures in orthorhombic and tetragonal crystals, respectively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Amino Acid Sequence Analysis All the members of the protein family to which MPN314 belongs are composed of two sequence domains, both of which belong to a 70-residue protein family UPF0040 (Pfam2). The sequence comparison among MPN314 and its close homologs is shown in Figure 2. This protein is highly conserved in various bacterial organisms with many conserved residues. Since each protein contains two repeating sequence domains which are homologous to each other, we have aligned the two sequence domains against each other for MPN314 and its close homologs (Fig. 2). The most conserved region in the UPF0040 family appears to be located between residues 10 to 19, especially residue Asp 11 and Arg 15 (Asp 82 and Arg 86 in the second sequence domain). These two residues are found in all full-length sequence homologs of MPN314 and are conserved even in poor homologs with an E-value as high as 1E-3. The conserved DXXXR sequence motifs from both domains of MPN314 are in close proximity to each other (see below), and we suggest that they form the functional site of this protein as well as members of this protein family. There are some other highly conserved residues in UPF0040, including Gly 3, Leu 10, Gly 14, Pro 19, Arg 23, Gly 35, Ala 65 (in the second sequence domain, they are Gly 74, Leu 81, Gly 85, Pro 90, Arg 94, Gly 106, Ala 136), although none of these residues is fully conserved. Residues 43, 48, 115, and 20 have preference for Trp, Tyr or Phe. Also, some residues are found to be conserved in only one of the sequence domains, e.g., Lys 13, Arg 70, Ala 97, Lys 101, Glu 113. Overall Structure The overall structure of MPN314 is an octameric ringshaped structure. Eight monomers are arranged to form a pseudo 8-fold symmetry (Fig. 3A, B, C). Each monomer has two subdomains related by a pseudo two-fold axis. In all three crystal forms we have observed this octamer structure despite different crystal symmetry, crystal packing environment and crystallization conditions. This observation strongly suggests that the octameric form is the biological aggregation state. The octameric ring has a maximum outer diameter of 110 Å and an inner diameter of 34 Å. The thickness of the ring is 30 Å. The ring is assembled by 8 monomers in a "hand-in-hand" locked-in arrangement. The C-terminal helix of each monomer is in contact with two other helices of the next monomer (Fig. 3B, C). The protein structure

does not reveal any obvious deep pocket or cleft as a potential active site or ligand binding site (Fig. 3A, B, C), except for the large central ring opening, the clefts formed by intermonomer interfaces and the grooves formed between each monomer extrusion (Fig. 3A, B, C). Electrostatic potential surface indicates this protein has a negatively charged inner ring surface. The outer ring surface, however, is mainly positively charged, especially on the protrusion of each monomer. A Novel Fold Structure The monomer structure is a single-domain protein. The protein has a roll-type fold with mainly helices wrapping around a core formed by strands. Structural similarity search using DALI21 and CE22 failed to find any significant structural homologs in Protein Data Bank, indicating a novel protein fold. MPN314 has a central core of six-stranded twisted anti-parallel strands (strands 1, 3 , 4 , 4, 3, 1 ; Fig. 4A, B). The core is flanked by four helices on one sides (Helices 3, 4, 3 , 4 ; Fig. 4A, B), two shorter helices on another (Helices 2, 2 ), and two anti-parallel strands ( 2, 2 ) form the bottom of this domain (Fig. 4A, B). The approximate sequence repeat of this protein is manifested by a structural pseudo two-fold symmetry (Fig. 4A, B). In Figure 4, two UPF0040 sequence domains are colored as blue and green, respectively. The most striking structural difference between the two UPF0040 sequence domains is located at the two flanking helices, namely between helix 4 and the C-terminal helix 4 (Fig. 4A, B). The C-terminal 4 helix extends out to the next monomer (Fig. 3), interacting with 3 and 4 helices of the neighboring monomer to form an octamer ring structure (Fig. 3). The primary sequence is least conserved at the C-terminal region of each UPF0040 sequence domain (Fig. 2). The variability at sequence level is also reflected in the threedimensional structure. At the bottom of this single-domain structure, there are two short 5-residue helices, 1 and 1 . It is noteworthy to point out that these two helices form the extrusion tip of each monomer at the outer ring (Fig. 3; Fig. 4A). Topology The central core of six strands has a topology of 12516231224123 which is an uncommon topology for -strand structures (Fig. 4 C). Using DALI21 search engine, we did not find any structural homolog for this central six -strand core either. It is also obvious from the topology of the protein structure that secondary structural elements from each UPF0040 sequence domain interdigitate with each other: the central core region is formed by strands from both UPF0040 sequence domains. Thus, one folding domain requires both UPF0040 sequence domains. DXXXR Motif A highly conserved DXXXR sequence motif is found in UPF0040 families, not only when sequences are aligned using the entire length, but also when the repeating

sequence subdomain sequences are aligned (Fig. 2). Structurally, this motif is located in the 1 and 1 helices in each monomer (Fig. 5A, B). Two DXXXR motifs are brought together and form a cluster around the structural pseudo 2-fold symmetry in each monomer (Fig. 5B). In the ocatmer ring structure, this motif forms the tip of the extrusion on the outer ring surface (Fig. 5A). To identify the possible active site in UPF0040 protein family, we have queried structure database PROCAT24 and RIGOR25 for possible indications for the biochemical function of this protein without any success. PROCAT found a similar residue constellation in the amylase active site. However, it is not meaningful in the context of our structure, e.g., the substrate binding pocket for this motif does not exist in the corresponding structure of MPN314. Results of motif search using RIGOR falls into two categories: hydrophobic cluster of residues in known structures and motifs related to binding of substrates or metal ions. However, none of these substrates or metal ions was found in the electron density map. These queries failed to reveal any known motif that contains a DXXXR, the motif that is highly conserved in MPN314. This indicates that MPN314 harbors a new sequence motif that has not been observed until now. CONCLUSION MPN314 represents a protein family which is present in almost all bacteria and appears to be essential for their survival. Although the molecular function of this gene family is not known, it is always the first in the gene clusters associated with the cellular function of cell division and cell wall biosynthesis. The crystal structure of MPN314 reveals a novel protein fold not seen before, and strongly suggests that the protein functions as an octamer. Even with the knowledge of its cellular function neither sequence nor the structure directly suggest any molecular function. Furthermore, the protein structure does not possess any features similar to any known active site motif or binding site motif. However, the structure strongly identifies a physical site containing a conserved sequence motif. The conserved sequence domains and their location in the 3-D structure as well as oligomeric organization of this protein set the stage for the experimental search for the molecular function of this protein family, which is conserved in all or most bacteria.
