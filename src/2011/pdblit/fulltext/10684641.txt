ABSTRACT: Lytic transglycosylases catalyze the cleavage of the -1,4-glycosidic bond between Nacetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in peptidoglycan with concomitant formation of a 1,6-anhydro bond in the MurNAc residue. To understand the reaction mechanism of Escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase Slt35, three crystal structures have been determined of Slt35 in complex with two different peptidoglycan fragments and with the lytic transglycosylase inhibitor bulgecin A. The complexes define four sugar-binding subsites (-2, -1, +1, and +2) and two peptide-binding sites in a large cleft close to Glu162. The Glu162 side chain is between the -1 and +1 sugar-binding sites, in agreement with a function as catalytic acid/base. The complexes suggest additional contributions to catalysis from Ser216 and Asn339, residues which are conserved among the MltB/Slt35 lytic transglycosylases.

Lytic transglycosylases catalyze the cleavage of the -1,4glycosidic bond between N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc)1 and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in peptidoglycan with concomitant formation of a 1,6-anhydro bond in the MurNAc residue (anhMurNAc) (1). These bacterial enzymes play a role in peptidoglycan metabolism, but their precise functions are not known. Among others, they have been implicated as space makers for the insertion of new peptidoglycan into the cell wall during remodeling and cell growth (2) and as cell wall zippers during cell division (3). Furthermore, they may function in the recycling of old peptidoglycan material (4) or may make pores in the peptidoglycan layer to allow transport of DNA and proteins across the cell wall (5). Because peptidoglycan is unique and essential for bacteria, lytic transglycosylases may be effective targets for drug design (6). Structural research on lytic transglycosylases has so far resulted in the X-ray structures of the 70 kDa soluble lytic transglycosylase Slt70 (7) and the 36 kDa soluble lytic transglycosylase Slt35 of Escherichia coli (8, 9). Slt35 is a fully active, soluble form of the 40 kDa membrane-anchored lytic transglycosylase B (MltB). Limited proteolysis of the peptide bond between residues 39 and 40 results in the release of Slt35 (residues 40-361) (10-12). The structure

of Slt35 shows three domains named the R, , and core domains. The core domain resembles the fold of goose-type lysozyme and the catalytic domain of Slt70 (9). It contains Glu162, which coincides with the catalytic Glu478 of Slt70 and Glu73 of goose-type lysozyme after superposition. Near Glu162, a deep groove is present in the core domain, where a GlcNAc residue was found to occupy carbohydrate-binding subsite -2 (for binding site nomenclature, see ref 13). Furthermore, the core domain contains an EF-hand calciumbinding site (9, 14), which is about 20 Å from Glu162. Both Slt35 and Slt70 are exo-muramidases that require the peptide side chains in peptidoglycan for activity (15, 16). It is believed that the N-terminal, doughnut-shaped domain of Slt70 and the "exo-loop" of Slt35 (residues 99-108) impose this exo-muramidase activity (9). To further analyze the active site architecture of Slt35 and to understand its peptidoglycan cleavage mechanism, we determined the binding mode of (GlcNAc)2 (chitobiose), the peptidoglycan fragment GlcNAc-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu (murodipeptide), and the glycopeptide bulgecin A in the active site of Slt35 by X-ray crystallography (see Figure 1 for schematic diagrams of these compounds). Bulgecin A is a natural lytic transglycosylase inhibitor containing a 4-Osulfonated GlcNAc residue and a 4-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-L-proline with a linked taurine residue (6, 17, 18). This study allows us to define four sugar-binding sites and two peptide-binding sites. Furthermore, the complexes suggest contributions to catalysis from Glu162, Ser216, and Asn339, residues which are conserved among the MltB/Slt35 lytic transglycosylases. MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization. The Slt35 protein was isolated as described previously (11). The resulting protein solution consisted of 28 mg/mL Slt35, 1% polyethylene glycol 20000 (PEG20K),

Bulgecins are produced by Pseudomonas mesoacidophila and Pseudomonas acidophila in three different forms, A-C (35). Bulgecin A constitutes the major component and has linked a taurine residue (NHCH2CH2SO3) to the 4-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-L-proline (indicated as "hydroxyproline") via an amide bond. Instead of a taurine residue, bulgecins B and C have linked a -alanine (NHCH2CH2COOH) or a free OH group. (C) The disaccharide chitobiose, (GlcNAc)2.

150 mM NaCl, and 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5). Prior to the crystallization experiments, this solution was diluted four times with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 1% 2-propanol, and subsequently dialyzed for 6 h against 10 mM TrisHCl buffer (pH 7.2) and 1% 2-propanol. This was done to remove ethylene glycol, which appeared to be bound in the active site of the native Slt35 structure (9) and which probably originated from the PEG20K. The enzyme was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with 3 µL of protein solution and 3 µL of reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 M bicine-NaOH buffer (pH 7.8) only (8). Soaking Experiments. A 25% (w/v) PEG20K stock solution was dialyzed against pure water using a membrane with a 6-10 kDa cutoff for 24 h. The concentration of the PEG20K was determined with a GPR 11-37 refractometer (Index Instruments). The Slt35 crystals were repeatedly washed in a solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and 2% dialyzed PEG20K. Subsequently, one crystal was soaked in a solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 2% dialyzed PEG20K, and 17 mM N-(acetylglucosamyl)N-(acetylmuramyl)-L-alanyl-D-glutamic acid (murodipeptide obtained from Sigma) for 4 h. A second crystal was soaked for 18.5 h in a solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 2% dialyzed PEG20K, 1 mM CaCl2, and 20 mM bulgecin A [kindly provided by A. J. Dijkstra (F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd.)]. A third crystal was also soaked in this bulgecin A solution, but after 2 min, it was transferred to a solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 2% dialyzed PEG20K, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 mM bulgecin A, and 10 mM chitobiose (purchased from Sigma) and soaked for 1/2 min. Data Collection and Processing. For the diffraction experiments, the crystals were flash-frozen at 120 K in a stream of evaporating nitrogen after having been soaked for 30-60 s in a cryoprotectant consisting of 50 µL of 87% glycerol and 50 µL of soaking solution. The Slt35murodipeptide and Slt35-bulgecin A-chitobiose data were collected in house on DIP image plates (MacScience) using CuKR radiation from a Nonius FR591 rotating anode generator with Franks' mirrors. The Slt35-bulgecin A data set was measured at the X11 beamline of the EMBL outstation at DESY (Hamburg, Germany) using 0.9057 Å radiation and a FastMar-Research image plate detector system. All data were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK

(19), and the measured intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes with programs from the Groningen BIOMOL software package. Data collection statistics can be found in Table 1A. Refinement. For the refinement, the same reflections that were selected for the Rfree calculations of the native data set (10% of the reflections) were set aside (20). As a starting model, the refined native Slt35 structure to 1.7 Å resolution was used, including the solvent molecules and alternate side chain conformations (9). After rigid-body refinement (3.58.0 Å resolution), the models were refined in several cycles of Powell energy minimization, occupancy refinement of alternate side chain conformations, and overall and individual B-factor refinement with the program X-PLOR, version 3.843 (21), and addition of solvent and substrate molecules and manual rebuilding in O (22). Only the solvent molecules and alternate side chains with electron density above 1 in 2Fo - Fc maps we kept during the refinement. The force constants and parameters used for the sugars were those described by Weis et al. (23) as implemented in the X-PLOR geometry files. The coordinates, parameter file, and topology file of bulgecin A were derived from a desulfonated form of bulgecin (17). Low-resolution diffraction data to 20 Å were included, and a bulk solvent correction was applied. The application of an anisotropic B-factor scaling and a resolution-dependent and 1/2 weighting scheme resulted in lower Rfree values and smaller differences between Rwork and Rfree. The last refinement cycle was repeated with all data, including the test set. The final refinement statistics for the complex structures are summarized in Table 1B. Stereochemistry was inspected with the program PROCHECK (24). RESULTS Three crystals of Slt35 were successfully soaked with the murodipeptide N-(acetylglucosamyl)-N-(acetylmuramyl)-Lalanyl-D-glutamic acid, the glycopeptide bulgecin A, and a mixture of bulgecin A and chitobiose, respectively (Figure 1). In each complex, a calcium ion is bound in the EF-hand calcium-binding site in a fashion similar to that described previously (14). The side chain of the first N-terminal residue Met40 and an internal stretch of 8-10 residues (99-108 or 101-108) do not exhibit interpretable electron density in Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc omit maps and have been omitted

from the models. All residues are found in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran diagram according to PROCHECK (24) and have good stereochemistry. Details of the structure determinations of the three complexes are summarized in Table 1. Slt35-Murodipeptide Complex. Two murodipeptides (murodipeptides A and B) were found to be bound in the active site cleft of Slt35 (Figure 2A). Murodipeptide A binds with its GlcNAc and MurNAc residues in subsites -2 and -1, respectively, while murodipeptide B occupies subsites +1 and +2 (Figures 3A and 4A). Because its electron density was weak, murodipeptide A was refined with an occupancy of 0.5. However, some residual density remained at subsites -2 and -1, in which a glycerol molecule and six water molecules could be placed with an occupancy of 0.5. The density for the -1 MurNAc residue is not very clear. Several different orientations may be present for this residue. In the model presented here, the -1 MurNAc has been modeled in the energetically most favorable 4C1 chair conformation, with the O1 hydroxyl group in a -anomeric configuration.

The GlcNAc residue at subsite -2 has a full 4C1 chair conformation and binds with its N-acetyl group in a cavity that predominantly consists of the aromatic rings of Phe226, Tyr259, and Tyr338. The N-acetyl group is within hydrogen bonding distance of the Ser230 O atom and the Met227 N atom. The O3-hydroxyl group may form a hydrogen bond to the Tyr259 side chain, whereas the O6-hydroxyl group is within hydrogen bonding distance of the carbonyl oxygen atom of the L-Ala residue at subsite -1. The MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu moiety of murodipeptide A binds in subsite -1. The electron density for the N-acetyl group permits two orientations with the group pointing either upward or downward. In the down position, it has no interactions with protein or ligand atoms, while in the up position, its O7 and N2 atoms are within hydrogen bonding distance of Gln98 and a water molecule bound to Ser216, respectively. The position of the MurNAc O1 atom is uncertain, because of its lack of electron density. The O6hydroxyl group is within hydrogen bonding distance of Tyr338 and Glu162 (Figure 4A). The D-lactyl moiety and

(B) The Slt35-bulgecin A-chitobiose complex with bulgecin A in subsites -2 and -1 and chitobiose in subsites +1 and +2. The catalytic acid/base Glu162 is located between subsites -1 and +1. Glu162, the substrates, and the calcium ion in the EF-hand calcium-binding site are shown as ball-and-stick representations. The R, , and core domains are colored green, red, and yellow, respectively, while the EF-hand loop (residues 237-245) and the calcium ion are colored light blue. The residues of the exo-loop (residues 99-108) run from R-helix H3 to R-helix H4, but due to flexibility, most of these residues could not be identified in the electron density maps. Only for the Slt35-murodipeptide and Slt35-bulgecin A complexes electron density was present for residues 99 and 100 of the exo-loop (magenta in panel A), and therefore, these residues could be included in the models. This figure was produced with MOLSCRIPT (36).

the dipeptide are stabilized by Arg188 and Arg187, respectively. Interestingly, the bound murodipeptide A seems to stabilize residues 99 and 100 of the exo-loop (residues 99108), which were not visible in the native 1.7 Å Slt35 structure. This is probably due to hydrophobic interactions between Pro100 and the dipeptide moiety of murodipeptide A. Murodipeptide B binds with its GlcNAc residue in subsite +1, and the MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu moiety at subsite +2. Both GlcNAc and MurNAc exhibit clear density for a 4C1 chair conformation (Figure 3A). GlcNAc is within hydrogen bonding distance of Glu162 and Asn339, while the +2 MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu moiety might form hydrogen bonds

with residue 161 and His343 (Figure 4A). The MurNAc residue clearly exhibits electron density for an O1-hydroxyl group in an R-anomeric configuration, which is probably due to the formation of a hydrogen bond between the O1 atom and the side chain of Gln207 of a symmetry-related molecule. The L-Ala-D-Glu dipeptide makes mainly van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of Tyr117, Lys120, and Phe121. Slt35-Bulgecin A Complex. Bulgecin A is bound in an extended conformation with the GlcNAc residue in a 4C1 chair conformation at the -2 subsite and the hydroxyproline residue at the -1 subsite (Figure 4B). The GlcNAc residue occupies the same position as the GlcNAc residue of

bonding distance of the side chains of Arg188 and Tyr191. Furthermore, the N-acetyl nitrogen is now within hydrogen bonding distance of the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr338 (Figure

Asn339, respectively. The carbonyl oxygen of the hydroxyproline moiety may form a hydrogen bond to the O of Ser216. Probably, a weak electrostatic interaction is present between the carboxylate group of Glu162 and the amine nitrogen in the proline ring (distance of 4.1 Å). This atom is

1930 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 8, 2000 most likely protonated at the pH of the experiment (pH 8.0), as the pKa of this group is about 10.6 (25). The taurine residue (NHCH2CH2SO3) is linked to the carbonyl group of the hydroxyproline via a peptide bond. The sulfonyl group has no direct hydrogen bonds with Slt35. Its atomic displacement parameters are higher than those of the rest of bulgecin (between 50 and 60 Å2), suggesting flexibility. The N10 atom of the taurine residue may form two water-mediated hydrogen bonds: one to the N2 atom of Asn339 and one to a sulfonyl oxygen of the taurine. Bulgecin A is an effective inhibitor of the lytic transglycosylase Slt70 of E. coli (6), but less so of Slt35 (16). In an attempt to understand this difference, we compared the binding modes of bulgecin A in Slt70 (26) and Slt35. In both enzymes, the inhibitor binds in a similar extended conformation. However, in Slt70 the N10 atom of bulgecin A makes a hydrogen bond to the carboxylate group of Glu583, but to a water molecule in Slt35. Both the Glu583 side chain and the water molecule are within hydrogen bonding distance of the N2 atom of a conserved asparagine residue (Asn553 in Slt70 and Asn339 in Slt35). Second, the O3 atom of the GlcNAc residue in bulgecin A makes two hydrogen bonds in Slt70 (to the O atom of Tyr533 and the O1 atom of Thr501), but one in Slt35 (to the O atom of Tyr259). Third, the O6 atom of bulgecin A cannot form hydrogen bonds in Slt70, but in Slt35, it is within hydrogen bonding distance of the N2 of Arg188 and the O of Tyr191, residues without an equivalent in Slt70. Fourth, bulgecin A has extra van der Waals interactions with Slt70 residues Ala554, Gly555, and Pro556 (forming a loop above subsites -2 and -1). These residues are absent in Slt35. Finally, bulgecin A has a tighter fit in the active site of Slt70. The volume of the bulgecin binding pocket is 635 Å3 in Slt70 and 719 Å3 in Slt35, as calculated with the program GRASP (27). Taken together, these differences may explain why bulgecin A is a better inhibitor of Slt70 than of Slt35. Slt35-Bulgecin A-Chitobiose Complex. In the ternary complex of Slt35 with bulgecin A and chitobiose, the bulgecin molecule is bound at subsites -2 and -1 in a fashion similar to that found in the Slt35-bulgecin A complex (Figures 2B, 3C, and 4C). Chitobiose is bound at subsites +1 and +2, but in a manner different from that of the sugar residues of murodipeptide B (Figure 5). On average, the ring atoms of the +1 and +2 sugars are displaced by 1.6 and 0.6 Å, respectively. The O6-hydroxyl group of the +2 GlcNAc of chitobiose may form hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen atom of Val161 and the N atom of Arg164. The latter hydrogen bond cannot be formed in the Slt35murodipeptide B complex, because of a different rotamer conformation of the arginine side chain. Like murodipeptide B, the +2 sugar has its O1 atom in an R-anomeric configuration stabilized by the side chain of Gln207 of a symmetry-related molecule. Whereas the O 1 atom of Glu162 is hydrogen bonded to the O3-hydroxyl group of the +1 GlcNAc residue in the Slt35-murodipeptide complex, in the Slt35-bulgecin A-chitobiose complex it is within hydrogen bonding distance of the O4-hydroxyl group of the +1 GlcNAc. Since the O 1 atom of Glu162 is supposed to donate a proton to the O4 of the +1 GlcNAc, it seems likely that the binding of chitobiose resembles more the sugar binding of peptidoglycan to Slt35 than the binding of the murodipeptide B.

van Asselt et al. Comparison with Peptidoglycan Binding in Slt70. The catalytic domains of Slt35 and Slt70 are very similar [rootmean-square deviation of 1.7 Å for 100 CR atoms (9)]. A comparison of the observed +1 GlcNAc binding modes in Slt35 and Slt70 shows that the +1 GlcNAc residue of the Slt35-bulgecin A-chitobiose complex is in a position similar to the +1 GlcNAc in the Slt70-1,6-anhydromuropeptide complex (ref 28 and Figure 5B). The +1 GlcNAc residues have conserved hydrogen bonding interactions in both proteins with their O3 atoms (to the O 1 atom of the conserved Gln225 and Gln496 in Slt35 and Slt70, respectively), their O4 atoms (to the O 1 atom of the catalytic acid/base Glu162 and Glu478 in Slt35 and Slt70, respectively), and their N2 atoms (to the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the catalytic acid/base). In contrast, the +1 GlcNAc residue of the Slt35-murodipeptide complex occupies a different position and makes only the latter conserved hydrogen bond. Because a tight binding of the +1 GlcNAc residue is important to preventing hydrolysis of the reaction intermediate (see Discussion), this strengthens the above conclusion that the chitobiose molecule in the Slt35bulgecin A-chitobiose complex resembles more a competent peptidoglycan binding mode in subsites +1 and +2 than the murodipeptide B. An intriguing difference between Slt35 and Slt70 is the hydrophobicity of their +1 sites. Val161 in Slt35 is substituted for a glutamine residue in Slt70 (Gln477). The shorter and hydrophobic valine side chain in Slt35 creates a hydrophobic pocket, which can accommodate the C6 atom of the +1 GlcNAc with favorable van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of Val161, Phe121, and Tyr344. In Slt70, a hydrogen bonding interaction is present between the O 1 atom of Glu477 and the O6 atom of the +1 GlcNAc. ActiVe Site Plasticity. The structural differences between native Slt35 (9), the Slt35-GlcNAc complex (9), and the three Slt35 structures presented here were studied by superimposing their backbone N, CR, and C atoms. The most significant difference is observed in the active site after binding of bulgecin A and the GlcNAc molecule in subsite -2 (Figure 5A), which induces a displacement of the main chain atoms of Tyr338, Asn339, and His340 by up to 0.9 Å in the various complex structures with respect to the native structure. This displacement is accompanied by the formation of a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen atom of Tyr338 and the N2 of the -2 GlcNAc residue in the Slt35GlcNAc and Slt35-bulgecin A complexes. This hydrogen bond is not observed in the Slt35-murodipeptide complex, which might be due to the partial occupancy. Furthermore, the displacement allows a hydrogen bond to be formed between the N2 atom of Asn339 and the O9 atom of bulgecin A, which is in a position similar to the O6 atom of the -1 MurNAc. A second significant difference concerns residues Arg187 and Arg188 in the Slt35-bulgecin A complexes, of which the main chain atoms have moved about 0.7-1.0 Å further into the active site compared to those in the native structure. Both residues are involved in substrate binding. Their movement results in a further narrowing of the active site cleft and might optimize the hydrogen bonding interactions with the peptide side chain of the -1 MurNAc.

The Slt35 complexes were superimposed on each other as described for panel A. The Slt70-1,6-anhydromuropeptide complex was superimposed on the Slt35 complexes using the LSQ option in the program O (22) by aligning Gln477, Glu478, Ser487, Gln496, and Tyr552 of Slt70 on Val161, Glu162, Ser216, Gln225, and Tyr338 of Slt35, respectively. For clarity, only the GlcNAc residue of the 1,6-anhydromuropeptide in Slt70 is shown. The black labels refer to Slt70 residues, while the pink labels refer to Slt35 residues.

DISCUSSION Peptidoglycan-Binding Cleft. This study shows that the E. coli lytic transglycosylase Slt35 contains at least four sugar-binding sites. GlcNAc residues bind in subsites -2 and +1 and MurNAc residues in subsites -1 and +2. Near the MurNAc binding sites are two peptide-binding regions. So far, only two other crystal structures of a protein complexed with a muropeptide have been elucidated: the T26E mutant of phage T4 lysozyme (T4L) complexed with the murotetrapeptide (GlcNAc-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-Glu-m-DapD-Ala) in subsites -2 and -1 (29) and Slt70 complexed with a 1,6-anhydromurotripeptide (GlcNAc-anhMurNAc-L-Ala-

D-Glu-m-Dap) in subsites +1 and +2 (28). The catalytic domains of Slt35, Slt70, and T4L have a similar fold with a comparable substrate-binding groove. Comparison of the complexes shows that both Slt35 and T4L bind a GlcNAc residue in subsite -2 with the GlcNAc residues making similar interactions with an aromatic residue (Tyr338 in Slt35 and Phe104 in T4L) and a hydrophobic residue (Met227 in Slt35 and Leu32 in T4L). Furthermore, these two proteins bind a MurNAc residue in subsite -1. In both enzymes, the MurNAc O6 atom is within hydrogen bonding distance of the O 2 atom of the catalytic glutamic acid (Glu162 in Slt35 and Glu11 in T4L), and the free CR carboxylate group of

1932 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 8, 2000 the D-Glu residue in the MurNAc peptide side chain makes a salt bridge to an arginine residue (Arg187 in Slt35 and Arg137 in T4L). Notwithstanding these similarities, it should be noted that in the T4L mutant the -1 MurNAc residue is covalently bound (to Glu26), but not in Slt35. In Slt35, Ala220 is in a position equivalent to that of Glu26 in the T4L mutant and its C atom has a hydrophobic interaction with the C5 atom of the -1 MurNAc residue. Comparison of the Slt35-bulgecin A-chitobiose complex and the Slt70-1,6-anhydromurotripeptide complex shows that in both enzymes the O4 atom of the +1 GlcNAc is hydrogen bonded to the O 1 atom of the catalytic acid/base (Glu162 in Slt35 and Glu478 in Slt70). This hydrogen bond may mimic the interaction of the catalytic Glu with the glycosidic oxygen of the scissile bond during the cleavage reaction. Reaction Mechanism. Lytic transglycosylases catalyze the cleavage of the -1,4-glycosidic bond between MurNAc and GlcNAc with concomitant formation of a 1,6-anhydro bond in the MurNAc residue. They use a Glu as an acid/base to facilitate the reaction. In Slt35, Glu162 is located between the -1 and +1 subsites in a hydrophobic environment created by the side chains of Ile158, Gln225, Tyr338, and Tyr344. This environment stabilizes the protonated state of Glu162 at the optimum pH of the reaction (pH 5.0), which enables Glu162 to have a hydrogen bonding interaction with the glycosidic oxygen of the scissile bond. It is the only acid in the peptidoglycan-binding cleft of Slt35, and its position coincides with the catalytic acid/base Glu478 of Slt70 after superposition (9). Furthermore, a Glu162Gln mutation yielded an inactive enzyme (9). From this, we conclude that Glu162 is the catalytic acid/base in the reaction catalyzed by Slt35. During the cleavage reaction, a positively charged oxocarbonium ion-like intermediate is likely to occur. The oxocarbonium ion should be shielded from the solvent to allow attack by the -1 MurNAc O6 atom and to prevent a hydrolysis reaction. For Slt70, it has been proposed that the NH2+ moiety of the bulgecin hydroxyproline mimics the oxocarbonium ion intermediate (26). If this is also true for Slt35, the bulgecin NH2+ group should be shielded from the solvent as well. Comparison of the binary and ternary Slt35bulgecin A complexes shows that the +1 GlcNAc O3 and O4 atoms replace two water molecules that interact with the -1 hydroxyproline NH2+ group of bulgecin (Figure 4B,C). These water molecules could mimic the hydrolytic water molecule attacking the oxocarbonium intermediate. Thus, a prolonged presence of a GlcNAc residue in the +1 site could prevent such a hydrolysis reaction. The peptide bond between the hydroxyproline and taurine parts of bulgecin A is supposed to mimic an N-acetyl group that stabilizes the oxocarbonium ion intermediate (26). In Slt70, the O and N atoms of this peptide bond are hydrogen bonded to the O of Ser487 and the carboxylate group of Glu583, respectively. In Slt35, Ser216 occupies a position equivalent to Ser487 and forms a hydrogen bond to the taurine peptide carbonyl oxygen atom. No residue has been identified in Slt35 that can take over the role of Glu583 of Slt70. Nevertheless, a superposition of the substrate complexes of Slt35 and Slt70 shows that around the position of the Glu583 carboxylate group in Slt70, five hydrogen bond donors are present in Slt35: N2 of Asn339, N 2 of Gln98,

van Asselt et al. NH of L-Ala in subsite -1, N10 of bulgecin A (which would correspond to the N2 of a MurNAc residue), and the O6hydroxyl group of GlcNAc in subsite +1. Because a free carboxylate group can accept four to five hydrogen bonds, it is tempting to assume that these hydrogen bond donors create a binding site for a free carboxylate group, which can stabilize the reaction intermediate. Such a carboxylate group could come from the peptidoglycan substrate itself, which would explain why the peptide chains of peptidoglycan are absolutely required for activity (16). One possibility would be the free carboxylate group of the -1 D-Glu residue. This group makes, however, a salt bridge to the side chain of Arg187 and is therefore unlikely to supply the stabilizing carboxylate group. However, the +2 D-Glu residue has a free carboxylate group which can be modeled into the carboxylate binding pocket (data not shown). On the basis of our crystallographic studies and what is known for Slt70 (26) and other polysaccharide-degrading enzymes (30, 31), we propose the following reaction mechanism for Slt35 (Figure 6). In the first step, Slt35 binds the nonreducing end of a peptidoglycan strand at subsites -2, -1, +1, and +2 (see Table 2 for the Slt35 residues involved in the binding of peptidoglycan). The terminal GlcNAc residue is bound in subsite -2, because Slt35 acts as an exomuramidase, which starts at the nonreducing GlcNAc end of a peptidoglycan strand and processively releases 1,6anhydromuropeptides (9, 16). Binding of peptidoglycan at subsites -2 and -1 triggers small active site movements (induced fit), which allow optimization of the binding interactions. The N-acetyl group of the -1 MurNAc is oriented and stabilized by Ser216. The free carboxylate of the -2 D-Glu may interact with the N-acetyl group as well. The MurNAc sugar ring is believed to be distorted from a ground-state chair into the more reactive sofa conformation. A distortion of the -1 sugar from the ground state to the sofa form would optimize the overlap of the C1-O4 * antibonding orbital and one of the lone pairs of the O5 atom and thereby weaken the C1-O4 bond (32). The weakened scissile bond can now easily be cleaved with concomitant protonation of the glycosidic O4 oxygen by the protonated O 1 atom of Glu162. Cleavage of the glycosidic bond results in the formation of a positively charged -1 MurNAc oxocarbonium ion and a negatively charged Glu162. The negative charge of the Glu162 carboxylate group may be stabilized by three hydrogen bonds with the Tyr344 hydroxyl group, the -1 MurNAc O6-hydroxyl group, and the +1 GlcNAc O4-hydroxyl group. The positively charged oxocarbonium ion is probably stabilized by the N-acetyl oxygen of MurNAc, either by a charge-charge interaction or by a covalent oxazolinium intermediate. This is similar to what has been proposed for Slt70 (26) and chitin-degrading enzymes (30, 33). The reaction intermediate in Slt35 is shielded from the solvent by the N-acetyl group of the -1 MurNAc, the +1 GlcNAc, the +2 D-Glu, and Asn339, which prevents a nucleophilic attack by a water molecule. To form the 1,6-anhydro bond, the MurNAc residue needs to change from a sofa into a boat conformation to bring the O6 atom closer to the C1 atom for nucleophilic attack. Thereby, the O 2 atom of Glu162 could enhance the nucleophilicity of the O6 atom by abstracting its proton. This would result in the formation of a negatively charged O6 atom, which might be stabilized by Asn339. In the Slt35-bulgecin A complexes,

a Residues of Slt35 within 4.5 Å of murodipeptides A and B, bulgecin A, and (GlcNAc) . The underlined residues are or can be involved in the 2 hydrogen bonding with the peptidoglycan residues (within 3.5 Å) based on the three crystal structures.

the N2 atom of Asn339 is found within hydrogen bonding distance of the O9 atom of bulgecin A, which is in a position similar to the -1 MurNAc O6 atom. It is therefore probable that Asn339 facilitates the proton abstraction of the O6 atom by Glu162. The subsequent attack by the O6 atom on the positively charged C1 atom would yield the 1,6-anhydro bond in the MurNAc residue. Finally, the 1,6-anhydromuropeptide is released, and the GlcNAc and MurNAc residues in subsites +1 and +2 may move to subsites -2 and -1. The enzyme is now ready for a new catalytic cycle. The study presented here shows that three residues in subsite -1 of Slt35 may play an important role in the binding and cleavage of peptidoglycan: Glu162, Ser216, and Asn339. In E. coli Slt70, the equivalent residues are Glu478, Ser487, and Asn553. These three residues are strictly conserved among all known MltB/Slt35 and Slt70 lytic transgly-

cosylases, as shown by amino acid sequence analyses (9, 28). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have already shown that mutation of the catalytic Glu into a Gln residue resulted in inactive enzymes (7, 9). Mutation of the other two residues could unambiguously demonstrate their importance in the reaction mechanism of lytic transglycosylases. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Dr. A.-M. W. H.
