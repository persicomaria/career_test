In order to design selective, high-affinity ligands to a target protein, it is advantageous to understand the structural determinants for protein ≠ ligand complex formation at the atomic level. In a model system, we have successively mapped the factor Xa binding site onto trypsin, showing that certain mutations influence both protein structure and inhibitor specificity. Our previous studies have shown that introduction of the 172SSFI175 sequence of factor Xa into rat or bovine trypsin results in the destabilisation of the intermediate helix with burial of Phe174 (the down conformation). Surface exposure of the latter residue (the up conformation) is critical for the correct formation of the aromatic box found in factor Xa ≠ ligand complexes. In the present study, we investigate the influence of aromatic residues in position 174. Replacement with the bulky tryptophan (SSWI) shows reduced affinity for benzamidine-based inhibitors (1) and (4), whereas removal of the side-chain (alanine, SSAI) or exchange with a hydrophilic residue (arginine, SSRI) leads to a significant loss in affinity for all inhibitors studied. The variants could be crystallised in the presence of different inhibitors in multiple crystal forms. Structural characterisation of the variants revealed three different conformations of the intermediate helix and 175 loop in SSAI (down, up and super-up), as well as a complete disorder of this region in one crystal form of SSRI, suggesting that the compromised affinity of these variants is related to conformational flexibility. The influence of Glu217, peripheral to the ligand-binding site in factor Xa, was investigated. Introduction of Glu217 into trypsin variants containing the SSFI sequence exhibited enhanced affinity for the factor Xa ligands (2) and (3). The crystal structures of these variants also exhibited the down and super-up conformations, the latter of which could be converted to up upon soaking and binding of inhibitor (2). The improved affinity of the Glu217-containing variants appears to be due to a shift towards the up conformation. Thus, the reduction in affinity caused by conformational variability of the protein target can be partially or wholly offset by compensatory binding to the up conformation. The insights provided by these studies will be helpful in improving our understanding of ligand binding for the drug design process.

Protein Flexibility and Ligand Affinity

Introduction
Modern pharmaceutical research aims at developing safe and innovative drugs that bind selectively to a single target protein. Selective binding ensures a unique pharmacological response, and helps reduce undesirable side-effects. Yet many potential drug targets belong to superfamilies of structurally and functionally related proteins with similar ligand-binding sites. The distribution or compartmentalisation of related proteins into various organs, tissues and cellular locations within the organism has allowed nature to exploit proteins with similar actions for the manifestation of widely varying physiological responses. For the drug designer, however, the need to apply xeno-

biotic drugs systemically means that it is necessary to utilise the small structural variations between individual binding sites in order to achieve selectivity. A prerequisite for such specific addressing is a detailed understanding of the determinants responsible for nuances in affinity to a receptorbinding site. Recent advances in biotechnology and structural biology mean that information concerning the binding site of a potential target is increasingly available in the initial stages of a drug design project. The combination of this information with a detailed understanding of the rules governing the ligand-binding process offer the possibility of accelerating the drug discovery process. An implicit assumption for computational

approaches to drug design is that the affinity (and thereby selectivity) of a ligand is derived largely from direct contacts to amino acid residues of the receptor binding site. In order to test the validity of this assumption, we have introduced the binding site of factor Xa into the related enzyme trypsin via site-directed mutagenesis. On the basis of the known structure of factor Xa,1 ≠ 3 three regions were selected for insertion into rat4 and bovine5,6 trypsins: the 99 loop, the 190 loop and the 175 loop (Figure 1a). In factor Xa, residues Tyr99 of the 99 loop, Phe174 of the 175 loop and Trp215 form an aromatic box that is occupied by all low molecular mass factor Xa inhibitors studied to date.7 ≠ 11 As an initial scaffold, rat trypsin was mutated to yield two variants with the 99 loop and with the complete binding site of factor Xa.4 Structural investigation of the latter X(triple)rT variant (formerly known as X(99/175/190)rT, see Table 1) displayed large-scale structural rearrangeTable 1.

ments with respect to both trypsin and factor Xa (Figure 1b). The important side-chain of Phe174 was found to be buried in the hydrophobic core of the enzyme (the down conformation) bounded by residues Ile176, Trp215, Pro225, Val227 and the disulphide Cys168-Cys182, and the intermediate helix was reoriented and partially unwound (Figure 1b). Introduction of the factor Xa-specific inhibitor (2) into X(triple)rT crystals induced a substantial reorganisation of the binding site; namely, surface exposure of Phe174 and adjustment of the helix to form the factor Xa-like up conformation (Figure 1c). Although this pilot study demonstrated that the grafted loops were capable of adopting the desired target structure, the affinity of (2) for X(triple)rT was some 300-fold less than that for factor Xa; presumably, the structural transition absorbs part of the binding energy.

was an artefact of the rat trypsin crystals, we decided to switch our attention to bovine trypsin, for which a large amount of kinetic and structural data are available, as well as an established crystal soaking system for ligands.5,6 These variants have yielded insights into the structural determinants for ligand affinity and selectivity. Nevertheless, bovine trypsin variants incorporating the 175 loop failed to show the expected increase in affinity for factor Xa inhibitors (Table 1).6 We postulated that this may be due to a predominance of the down conformation in these variants (Figure 1d). Although the rat trypsin variant X(triple)rT4 also exhibited a down conformation, the structural data revealed that dynamic exchange is possible between the up and down conformations of the 175 loop in X(triple)rT. In contrast, the bovine variants appear to possess only the down conformation, despite the availability of multiple crystal forms and different inhibitors.6 Could it be that the down conformation of the Ser172-Ser173-Phe174-Ile175 (SSFI) sequence is energetically favoured and thus more stable in bovine trypsin than in corresponding rat trypsin variants? The contrasting kinetic and structural behaviour of X(triple)bT, X(triple)rT and factor Xa towards a variety of ligands prompted us to design and characterise further bovine trypsin variants that might influence the stability of loop region 175 and thereby interactions with ligands. Here, we describe the kinetic and structural characterisation of six variants in which residues 174 (Phe in factor Xa) and 217 (Ser in trypsin, Glu in factor Xa) are studied with respect to four distinct inhibitors (Table 1). Single amino acid substitutions at position 174 were aimed at disfavouring the burial of the aromatic side-chain, while Glu217 was introduced to test a possible stabilising influence in factor Xa.

Further possible stabilising interactions for the up conformation were sought. In factor Xa, the side-chain of Glu217 forms a solvent-accessible hydrogen bond to the side-chain of Ser173 in the 175 loop. To investigate whether this residue is capable of influencing the up conformation, two additional mutants were constructed: X(SSFI.Glu)bT and X(triple.Glu)bT, containing the entire binding site of factor Xa together with Glu217. Production of the variants and kinetic analysis Bovine trypsin variants X(SSYI)bT, X(SSWI)bT, X(SSAI)bT, X(SSRI)bT, X(SSFI.Glu)bT and X(triple. Glu)bT were cloned and expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. All variants could be refolded, resulting in catalytic activity towards the chromogenic substrate Pefachrome-tPA after activation by bovine enterokinase. Four compounds were chosen to compare the inhibition of the variants, selected for their differential inhibition of factor Xa and trypsin (Table 1).4 ≠ 6,12,13 Kinetic characterisation of the X(SSYI)bT variant revealed no difference in inhibition by compounds (1 ≠ 4) compared to X(SSFI)bT (Table 1). In contrast, X(SSWI)bT showed a reduction in affinity for two of the benzamidine-based inhibitors, (1) and (4), whilst showing comparable inhibition by (2) and (3). X(SSAI)bT was inhibited by (1), (3) and (4) in a fashion similar to that of X(SSWI)bT, but showed a marked decrease in affinity for the chloronaphthyl containing (2). A dramatic decrease was noted for all inhibitors with respect to X(SSRI)bT. All in all, the variants X(SSXI)bT at position 174 all showed similar or reduced affinity compared to X(SSFI)bT, with the most pronounced differences relating to the factor Xa selective inhibitor (2). In contrast, introduction of Glu217 in X(SSFI.Glu)bT resulted in a significant increase in affinity for inhibitors (2) and (3), the latter approaching closely that of factor Xa. The most dramatic change in affinity was observed for variant X(triple.Glu)bT with a threefold increase for (2) and a 25-fold increase for (3) with respect to the X(triple)bT variant. Crystallisation of the variants Co-crystallisation experiments of each variant were carried out at room temperature in the presence of inhibitors (1), (2), (3) and (4) at pH 7 ≠8 using PEG 8000 and ammonium sulphate (Table 2). Crystals were obtained with inhibitors (1) and (4) in both the trigonal P3121 (A) and orthorhombic closed (B) modifications commonly found for bovine trypsin,12,13 while no co-crystal was obtained with (2) or (3). Using ammonium sulphate as precipitant at pH 6, seeding experiments with wild-type trypsin orthorhombic open (C) crystals in the presence of (1) resulted in a new trigonal space group P3221 (D) in addition to orthorhombic (B) and (C) crystal forms. For variant X(triple.Glu)bT, crystal form D was obtained after

Results
Design of the variants In all previous bovine trypsin variants containing the factor Xa sequence Ser172-Ser173-Phe174Ile175 (Table 1),6 the down conformation of the intermediate helix was accompanied by the burial of the Phe174 side-chain in a hydrophobic pocket (Figure 1d). Four variants based on X(SSFI)bT were constructed to explore the cause and effect of this burial: (1) X(SSYI)bT, with a less hydrophobic side-chain that might favour the solvent-exposed up conformation; (2) X(SSWI)bT, whose bulky side-chain should be too large to occupy the hydrophobic cavity and could thus hinder the down conformation; (3) X(SSAI)bT, whose lack of an aromatic moiety should make it less amenable to the down position, and (4) X(SSRI)bT, whose hydrophilic side-chain should resist burial and therefore adopt the up conformation.

The 175 loop of the X(SSYI)bT variant is found in both cases in the down conformation as previously observed for rat4 and bovine trypsin6 variants, with the aromatic ring of Tyr174 superposing that of Phe174 in the X(SSFI)bT variants. In both crystal forms, the inhibitor (4) binds with its benzamidino moiety in the primary specificity pocket to make a salt-bridge to Asp189, ∞ together with hydrogen bonds to Gly219 O (3 A) g ∞ ) and two water molecules. and Ser190 O (2.7 A The remainder of the molecule exhibits an extended conformation (Figure 2), but with different binding modes in each crystal form, as described previously for bovine trypsin.12 In X(SSYI)bT.A4, the tosyl group of (4) occupies the S3/S4 site, with hydrogen bonds from the glycine spacer carbonyl oxygen atom of the inhibitor to ∞ Gly216N (2.9 A) and from the sulphonamide ∞ nitrogen atom to Gly216 O (2.9 A). In X(SSYI)bT.B4,

the glycine spacer hydrogen bonds to Gly219 N ∞ (2.8 A) and the sulphonamide hydrogen bonds to ∞ Gly216 O (3.0 A). The tosyl moiety does not address the S3/S4 site; instead, it occupies a hydrophobic cavity of a symmetry-related molecule, bounded by residues Lys159#, Cys136#, Leu137#, Val200# and Gly203#. Residual electron density in X(SSYI)bT.B4 indicates a second conformation for (4), similar to that observed in X(SSYI)bT.A4, in contrast to only a single conformation found in native bovine trypsin in the corresponding crystal form.12 Co-crystallisation experiments with variant X(SSWI)bT and (4) resulted in orthorhombic crystals X(SSWI)bT.B4. The inhibitor binds as described for X(SSYI)bT.B4, with the tosyl group involved in crystal contacts; in contrast to X(SSYI)bT.B4, only one binding mode is observed. Although the intermediate helix and the 175 loop of X(SSWI)bT.B4 are in the down conformation, the backbone atoms of residues 172 ≠175 shift by ∞ , 1 A towards the solvent to accommodate the burial of the larger indole ring of Trp174 (Figure 3). Crystallisation of variant X(SSAI)bT resulted in three different crystal forms in the presence of inhibitors (1) and (4) (Table 2). Co-crystallisation with (4) led to orthorhombic crystals X(SSAI)bT.B4,

with the 175 loop in the down conformation (Figure 4a). Density is weak for Ser173, and residues of the intermediate helix are displaced away ∞ from the body of the enzyme by ca 1 A with respect to their positions in X(SSFI)bT. A large cavity is created adjacent to Trp215, occupied in X(SSFI)bT by the aromatic side-chain of Phe174; no ordered solvent molecules are observed. The inhibitor binds in the same fashion as described for X(SSWI)bT.B4 and X(SSYI)bT.B4, both in the same crystal form. As in the latter structure, extra density indicates that the conformation of (4) observed in X(SSYI)bT.A4 is also partially present. Seeding using wild-type C crystals in the presence of (1) resulted in both the orthorhombic crystal form X(SSAI)bT.C1 and the new trigonal form X(SSAI)bT.D1. In both cases, benzamidine (1) is bound in the primary specificity pocket to make a salt-bridge to Asp189. In X(SSAI)bT.C1, the 175 loop is found in the up conformation (Figure 4b). As in X(SSAI)bT.B4, residues 172≠174 are defined by only weak density. The empty cavity observed in X(SSAI)bT.B4 is still present, but reduced in volume. In the new crystal modification D (X(SSAI) bT.D1), the 175 loop is in neither the up nor the

down conformation (Figure 4c), a conformation we refer to as super-up. The intermediate helix consists of only a single turn from residues 166 ≠169, which is translated half a pitch in the direction of the helix axis compared to factor Xa and trypsin (up conformation). The side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser172 is within hydrogen bonding distance of the main-chain N and O groups of Ala174. The super-up conformation is accompanied by a new arrangement of the Cys168-Cys182 disulphide bond (Figure 4d; Table 3), although we observe additional electron density at the disulphide corresponding to that seen in the up-structure. As a result of these movements, an even larger cavity is formed, flanked by the side-chains of Trp215, Pro225, Val227, Ile176 and cystine Cys168-Cys182. Although no solvent molecules are discernible within the cavity, the entrance is occupied by a single water molecule hydrogen bonded to Ser173N. For the Arg174 variant, crystal form X(SSRI)bT.C1 reveals the intermediate helix to be in the up conformation. In this case however, a re-registration of residues Ser171-Ser178 has taken place, such that Ile175 takes the position otherwise occupied in all other variants by Ile176; the latter replaces Thr177, and Ser178 O makes a hydrogen bond to the carboxamide side-chain of Asn233 Nd2 (Figure 5a). Following this reorganisation, the side-chain of Arg174 forms the "West" side of what would be the aromatic box, with the guanidinium function in the same location as the Phe174 phenyl ring in factor Xa. The same variant co-crystallised in the presence of (4) to form orthorhombic crystals X(SSRI)bT.B4. The inhibitor is bound exclusively in the conformation seen for X(SSAI)bT.B4. In contrast to all other structures determined so far, however, residues 169 ≠ 175 are disordered and only partial density is present for Trp215 (Figure 5b). Electron density for cystine Cys168-Cys182 can be interpreted as being that seen in X(SSAI)bT.C1 (up conformation). Crystal structures of Glu217 variants Variant X(SSFI.Glu)bT crystallised in complex

with (4) to form X(SSFI.Glu)bT.B4. The 175 loop is found in the down conformation (not shown; see below for X(triple.Glu)bT), with the inhibitor bound as observed in X(SSYI)bT.B4. The carboxylate side-chain of Glu217 reaches out into solution, ∞ where it makes a salt-bridge to Lys224 Nz (3 A). This, in turn, hydrogen bonds to Ser172 O. In crystal form X(SSFI.Glu)bT.D1, the intermediate helix, cystine Cys168-Cys182 and the 175 loop adopt the conformation seen in X(SSAI)bT.D1 (super-up, not shown). Glu217 realises an alternative rotamer to form an H bond between Glu217 O1 and Ser173 N ∞ (3.0 A), and to a new water molecule (Wat918) ∞ (3.0 A) at the position vacated by the Phe174 sidechain. The side-chain of Ser172 Og hydrogen bonds to Phe174 O. For variant X(triple.Glu)bT, containing the complete binding site of factor Xa together with Glu217, both trigonal crystal forms P3121 (A) and P3221 (D) were obtained in the presence of benzamidine. In X(triple.Glu)bT.A1, the 175 loop is found in the down conformation (Figure 6a). As for X(SSFI.Glu)bT.B4, the carboxylate group of Glu217 is involved in a charge-assisted hydrogen bonding network involving Glu217 O11 and O12, Lys224 Nz and Ser172 O. The side-chain of Tyr99 is perpendicular to that of Trp215 as observed for X(triple)bT,6 although additional electron density indicates the presence of further rotamers around x2 (308 ≠458 towards the centre of the aromatic box). In X(triple.Glu)bT.D1, the 175 loop is found in the super-up conformation as described for X(SSAI)bT.D1 and X(SSFI.Glu)bT.D1 variants (Figure 6b), yet disulphide Cys168-Cys182 adopts a conformation equivalent to that seen in X(SSAI)bT.C1 (up conformation) (Table 3). The side-chain of Glu217 covers the otherwise large cavity seen in the super-up conformation of X(SSAI)bT.D1. As for X(SSFI.Glu)bT.D1, Glu217 O1 approaches Ser173 N and coordinates the new water molecule (Wat918), which in this case is also ∞ coordinated by Ser172 Og (3.2 A). Soaking of (2) into X(triple.Glu)bT.D1 is accompanied by an increase in cell constant c by ∞ 8 A (Table 2). The intermediate helix rearranges from the super-up into the up conformation (Figure 6), so that this entire region is now structurally

The side-chain of Glu217 is involved in an extensive hydrogen bonding network: Glu217 hydrogen bonds to Wat918 as well as Ser173 N and Og; ∞ Ser173 Og approaches Lys224 Nz (3 A), which in turn is in contact with Ala171 O. The binding mode of (2) soaked into crystals of X(triple. Glu)bT.D is equivalent to that observed for bovine trypsin at pH 813 and rat trypsin variants X(99)rT and X(triple)rT.4 The chloronaphthyl moiety of the inhibitor binds deep in the primary specificity pocket, displacing the otherwise conserved water molecule Wat416. The pyridinyl group binds in the S3/S4 pocket of the enzyme variant, causing a constriction of the aromatic box. The side-chain x2

torsion angles of Phe174 and Tyr99 rotate by 468 and 588, respectively, so that they are both parallel with the plane of the inhibitor pyridinyl group (Figure 6c).

Discussion
In this study, we set out to elucidate the cause for the discrepancy in affinity of a range of serine proteinase inhibitors for trypsin variants designed to be structurally equivalent to factor Xa. The crystallographic data presented here reveal that replacement of only a few residues in the 175 loop of trypsin can compromise the structural integrity

of this region, resulting in manifold alterations in affinity for the ligands studied. Before discussing the relationship between structure and affinity, it is important to understand the influence of crystal packing on conformation and binding mode. We have previously reported12,13 that native bovine trypsin in the presence of inhibitors tends to crystallise without seeding in crystal forms A or B. Deviations from these forms have been observed only when inhibitor binding interfered with crystal packing, suggesting that the

appearance of alternative crystal forms is driven by inhibitor binding conformation and not vice versa. By the same token, the appearance of a novel crystal form with an alternative conformation of the 175 loop indicates that this must be stable and well populated under the conditions of the crystallisation experiment. In the present study, we have been fortunate in obtaining four different crystal forms (A ≠ D) in the presence of two different inhibitors (1 and 4). The down conformation of the intermediate

helix is observed in both crystal forms A and B. The same conformation of the helix is also observed in a completely different environment for the rat X(triple)rT variant,4 strongly suggesting that this architecture is a stable arrangement of the 175 loop. Similarly, the up conformation of the helix is found in crystal form C (the open orthorhombic form of native bovine trypsin commonly used for soaking experiments),13 and is obtained for X(triple.Glu)bT in crystal form D as well as rat X(triple)rT4 by diffusion of inhibitor (2) into the corresponding crystals. This architecture is also found in the molecular environment of the target molecule factor Xa.1 For three of the variants, we have obtained the novel third crystal form D, in which the intermediate helix is further unwound, representing the "super-up"-conformation. The fact that the down conformation in rat X(triple)rT and the super-up conformation in bovine X(triple.Glu)bT.D can each be converted in the crystal to the up conformation by binding of inhibitor (2) show that the energetic barriers between the three conformations described here

need not be particularly large, or at least can be compensated through ligand binding (see below). On the other hand, we have been able to obtain crystals of Ser172-Ser173-(Phe/Tyr)174-Ile175-containing bovine variants only in the down conformation (this study).6 While the absence of any crystals revealing an up conformation does not prove that the latter does not exist, we believe the energetic barrier is considerably higher than that for the other variants described here. Particular evidence for this comes from co-crystallisation experiments with the macromolecular inhibitor aprotinin (our unpublished results). In this study, X(SSWI)bT-aprotinin crystallises isomorphously to bovine trypsin-aprotinin,14 with the intermediate helix in the up conformation, while the X(SSFI)bTaprotinin complex crystallises in a new related crystal form with the 175 loop in the down conformation. It is illuminating to decompose the free energies of binding into contributions from each of the exchanged regions (Table 4), which yields rough estimates of their relative effects. Introduction of

Protein Flexibility and Ligand Affinity

the 175 loop results in reduced affinity for all benzamidine-based inhibitors (DDG (175 2 1) º ˛ 1.7 kJ/mol; DDG (175 2 3) º ˛ 1.5 kJ/mol; DDG (175 2 4) º ˛ 2.5 kJ/mol). The 99 loop enhances binding of inhibitor (2) (DDG (99 2 2) º 2 4.6 kJ/ mol), yet reduces affinity for (3) (DDG (99 2 3) º ˛ 1.9 kJ/mol). Replacement of Ser190 for Ala affects only the binding of inhibitor (2) to the tune of (DDG (190 2 2) º 2 1.5 kJ/mol). While introduction of Glu217 has no effect on binding of (1) and (4), it shows a stabilising effect on (2) (DDG (217 2 2) º 2 2.9 kJ/mol) and on (3), although the degree of stabilisation differs between X(SSFI.Glu) (DDG (217 2 3) º 2 5.4 kJ/mol) and X(triple.Glu) (DDG (217 2 3) º 2 8.2 kJ/mol). If we start with the premise that X(SSFI)bT-variants and X(SSYI)bT-variants are locked in the down conformation, then we can begin to rationalise the otherwise conflicting inhibition data shown in Table 1. The lack of increase in affinity of the factor Xa inhibitors (2) and (3) upon introduction of the factor Xa 175 loop into bovine trypsin6 might be explained by assuming that the up conformation is required for optimal binding. It is of interest that the same variants show a small but significant decrease in affinity for benzamidine (1) and inhibitor (4) (Table 4). Although the latter would nominally make use of the hydrophobic box in the binding mode seen in X(SSYI)bT.A4,12 the considerable influence exerted by crystal packing effects (X(SSYI)bT.B4, Figure 2) suggests that the dominant interactions for this compound are provided by the benzamidino-function. The reduction in affinities for (1) and (4) compared to trypsin are difficult to explain in structural terms, although small changes in protein or solvent structure within the primary specificity pocket may play a pivotal role. Attempts to destabilise the down conformation by replacing Phe174 with Trp, Ala and Arg yielded varying results. At one extreme, X(SSRI)bT showed severely compromised affinity for all of the inhibitors tested, with the relative exception of (3), where only a 50-fold drop in affinity was found compared to X(SSFI)bT. Inhibitor (3) binds to both trypsin (in its EZ-form) and X(triple)bT (in its ZZ-form) in an extended mode: the proximal amidino group occupies the primary specificity pocket to make a symmetric salt-bridge with the carboxylate group of Asp189, while the distal amidino group reaches out towards the S3/S4 pocket to stack over Trp215 (Figure 1).6 Although it might be argued that the presence of the basic residue Arg174 would be deleterious to binding the distal benzamidine of (3), this is refuted by the 35 nM inhibition of human tPA12 whose S3/S4 pocket is bounded by Tyr99, Trp215 and Arg174.15 Much more likely is the extreme plasticity of this variant, highlighted by the lack of electron density in X(SSRI)bT.B4. Similarly, X(SSAI)bT exhibits reduced affinity for inhibitors (1), (2) and (4); this variant also reveals three different conformations of the 175 region; namely, the down, up and

super-up. Inhibitor (2) binds to X(triple)rT and X(triple.Glu)bT with its chloronaphthyl moiety buried in the primary specificity pocket, while the pyridinyl group runs toward the aromatic box that is found in the up conformation (Figure 1).4 The extreme loss in affinity of SSAI for (2) (DDG (SSFI/SSAI) º ˛ 4.7 kJ/mol) is unlikely to be due to a lack of an aromatic side-chain at position 174 if we assume that SSFI is locked in the down conformation, where the West side of the pocket would be open to solvent (see Figure 1). Variant X(SSWI)bT exhibits a zwitter-like behaviour: affinities for the benzamidine inhibitors (1) and (4) are like those of X(SSAI)bT and X(SSRI)bT, yet affinities for the factor Xa inhibitors (2) and (3) are more like those for X(SSFI)bT. X(SSWI)bT.B4 shows this variant in the down conformation; as mentioned above, however, we observe the up conformation in co-crystals with aprotinin (our unpublished results). This is reminiscent of the case for X(triple)rT, in which binding of (2) occurs in the up conformation, establishing a favourable aromatic packing motif,4,13 and compensating for the energetic cost of the transition from the down conformation. Summarising briefly the results for the X(SSXI)bT variants, the desired destabilisation of the down conformation failed to yield higheraffinity interactions for factor Xa-selective inhibitors (2) and (3). On the contrary, introduction of a hydrophilic group in X(SSRI)bT, which should have favoured the up conformation, showed a drastic loss in affinity for all inhibitors and a dramatic destabilisation of the 175 region. Presumably, the energy barriers between up and super-up (and other possible structures) are sufficiently low that no one conformation is preferred in this variant. The introduction of plasticity (or flexibility) into our target enzyme results in a loss in affinity for benzamidine (1) and inhibitor (4). With the exception of the Glu217 variants, all proteins where we have observed multiple conformations (X(SSWI)bT, X(SSAI)bT, X(SSRI)bT, X(triple)rT) show reduced affinity for (1) and (4). Such a loss in affinity can be compensated by stabilisation of the up conformation through binding of an appropriate inhibitor such as (2) or (3). This plasticity is seen also for the rat trypsin variant X(triple)rT, explaining the difference in behaviour from that of the more stable (down) bovine variants X(triple)bT. Thus comparisons of X(SSXI)bT variants provide insights into the influence of flexibility on protein≠ ligand affinity. How can the large difference in affinity between variants X(triple)rT, X(triple)bT and factor Xa be explained? Introduction of Glu217 into X(SSFI)bT results in higher affinity for both (2) (DDG º 23:1 kJ/mol) and for (3) (DDG º 25:4 kJ/mol), whilst (1) and (4) exhibit affinities similar to those for X(SSFI)bT. The improved affinities of X(SSFI.Glu)bT for the factor Xa inhibitors over X(SSFI)bT can be explained by a relative destabilisation of the down conformation,

Protein Flexibility and Ligand Affinity

suggested by the appearance of the super-up conformation in X(SSFI.Glu)bT.D1. Similarly, X(triple.Glu)bT shows a threefold increased affinity compared with X(triple)bT for (2) (DDG º 22:8 kJ/ mol), and for (3) (DDG º 28:2 kJ/mol). Despite the helix in X(triple.Glu)bT.D1 being in the super-up form, the disulphide bridge Cys168-Cys182 adopts a conformation corresponding to that otherwise associated with the up conformation of the helix (Table 3). This, in turn, suggests that X(triple. Glu)bT may be energetically closer to the up conformation than any of the other variants observed in crystal form D. Comparison of X(triple.Glu)bT/ bovine trypsin and X(triple)rT/rat trypsin suggests that the transition in X(triple)rT costs an extra 3.6 kJ/mol compared to X(triple.Glu)bT. Stabilisation of the up conformation in the latter may be a result of the extensive charge-assisted hydrogen bonding network observed between Glu217, Lys224, Wat918, Ser173 and Ala171 O. Inhibitor (2) induces the complete transformation of super-up to up in this crystal; we presume that this transition is responsible for the remaining 30-fold reduced affinity compared to factor Xa. Yet this does not explain the almost perfect agreement in affinities of the bis-benzamidine inhibitor (3) for X(99)rT, X(triple)rT, X(SSFI.Glu)bT, X(triple.Glu)bT and factor Xa (Table 1). Interpretation of (3) is complicated by the fact that the inhibitor can undergo photoisomerisation to form a mixture of the (E,E), (E,Z) and (Z,Z) configuration isomers.16 As all kinetic measurements were carried out under standardised conditions, we assume that the relative proportions of the isomers are equivalent for each measured Ki value, and therefore have little influence on the observed affinity differences. The inhibitory active species for trypsin and factor Xa are (E,Z) and (Z,Z); we have shown that both isomers bind to bovine trypsin,12 tPA15 and X(triple)bT6 (and probably factor Xa) in a similar fashion, with both (E,Z) and (Z,Z) binding in an extended manner similar to (2) (see Figure 1c and d). As variants seen only in the down conformation (such as e.g. X(triple)bT) exhibit reduced affinity, inhibitor (3) must require the aromatic box. For three of the high-affinity variants, (X(99)rT, X(triple)rT, and X(triple.Glu)bT), we have shown that binding of (2) results in the formation of a factor Xa-like aromatic box, and have argued that there is an energetic cost for this conversion. If (3) binds to the up conformation, should there not be a reduction in affinity compared to factor Xa? The higher affinity of our 217-variants for (3) compared to (2) must mean that the transition is compensated by more favourable interactions in the bound state. Yet why should this be so, when binding of the other benzamidine-based inhibitors (1) and (4) is weaker compared to trypsin? One possible explanation is that binding of the distal benzamidine in the aromatic pocket could favour binding of the proximal benzamidine in the primary specificity pocket and vice versa. A stabilisation of the up

conformation by (3) would reduce the energetic barrier to the conformational transition, resulting in high-affinity binding. This would explain the anomalously high affinity data of (3) for X(triple. Glu)bT: despite containing elements detrimental to interactions with (3) (the 99 loop, DDG º ˛1:9 kJ/ mol and the 175 loop, DDG º ˛1:5 kJ/mol), we obtain a Ki value approaching that of factor Xa. These results fit well into the framework for cooperativity described recently by Williams and co-workers.17 Complex formation presumably results in a myriad of compensatory stabilising interactions, both of the enzyme (the up conformation) and the inhibitor (occupation of the S1 and aromatic pockets).

Conclusions
The results presented here highlight the complexities inherent in deriving affinity data from three-dimensional structures. In the current paper, we have attempted to explain our data based upon the assumption that X(SSFI)bT and factor Xa represent stable conformations that define the limits of conformational flexibility (down and up conformations, respectively). This is likely to be an oversimplification: indeed, we have previously suggested that conformational plasticity in the intermediate helix may be a driving force behind cofactor-induced activity modulation in haemostatic proteinases.4 A recent structural study of an inactive Ser195Ala thrombin variant appears to support this idea, in which a rearrangement of the disulphide bond Cys168-Cys182, proposed to be driven by sodium binding, is propagated to the active site, thereby restricting substrate access.18 The conformations we observe in the crystals represent individual sub-states within a spectrum of possible three-dimensional structures. The lower the energy barrier between these sub-states is, the more likely we are to observe alternative enzyme architectures. Thus, variants containing an aromatic residue at position 174 would tend to populate the down conformation: burial of the side-chain would be preferred over solvent exposure of the hydrophobic moiety, providing a driving force for the reorganisation of the intermediate helix. Variants with a hydrophilic sidechain would favour surface exposure of residue 174, shifting the equilibrium between various substates. The relative frequencies of these sub-states in a thermodynamic ensemble may be the cause of the differential affinities observed for the various inhibitors and variants. The complexity of the situation is summarised in Figure 7. The structures of the binding sites of X(triple)rT.2, X(triple.Glu)bT.D2 and factor Xa are virtually identical, yet affinity data for inhibitors (1), (2) and (3) differ by up to two orders of magnitude. Only by understanding the underlying conformational variability are we able to make sense of the measured inhibition constants. If one

Transitions to the up conformation have been observed in the crystal upon binding of inhibitor (2) (down to up for X(triple)rT and super-up to up for X(triple)bT). The differences in inhibition constants for (1 ≠3) are presumably a result of differing equilibria between the sub-states shown.

hypothesises that each inhibitor binds preferentially to the up conformation, then any departure to the down or super-up (or any other as yet not observed) state would result in an effective reduction in concentration of the "active" component, in turn reducing affinity. Alternatively, dynamic exchange between the various sub-states could reduce affinity for unadapted inhibitors through an inability to form defined, directed interactions. Conformational flexibility in protein ≠ligand interactions is nothing new; numerous cases have been reported, including thrombin,19 cAMP-dependent protein kinase,20 the oestrogen receptor21 and aldose reductase.22,23 Indeed, recognition of such flexibility has allowed generation of speciesspecific inhibitors for thymidylate synthase, despite a high level of sequence conservation.24 Until now, however, estimation of the energetic costs of such ligand-induced changes have been difficult to quantify physicochemically. Using the model system presented here, we are now in a position to attempt factorisation of the multitude contributions to ligand affinity. Aided by the fortuitous nature of bovine trypsin and its variants to crystallise in multiple crystal forms, it is possible to visualise the extent of conformational variability, and relate this to the protein≠ ligand interaction. Clearly, many aspects such as solvation and desolvation or enthalpic and entropic contributions remain open questions. Further studies of the energetics and dynamics of these processes will give us a better understanding of what makes a protein attractive for a ligand, which in turn will assist in the search for novel candidate drugs of the future.

structed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChangee kit (Stratagene).25 Mutations were introduced using pairs of complementary primers to replace Phe174 in variant X(SSFI)bT by Tyr, Trp, Ala and Arg. In addition, Ser217 of variant X(SSFI)bT and X(triple)bT was modified to Glu. All primers used are listed in Table 5. The amplified DNA was transformed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLys; the insoluble protein was refolded successfully as described.6 Refolded trypsinogen was activated to trypsin by cleavage with bovine enterokinase (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany); activated trypsin was purified and concentrated by FPLC using soybean trypsin inhibitor covalently bound to agarose (SIGMA).26 Kinetic characterisation of the mutants Kinetic activity and inhibition data of the six bovine trypsin variants were determined photometrically using the chromogenic substrate CH3SO2-D -HHT-Gly-ArgpNApAcOH (Pefachrome-tPa; Loxo GmbH, Dossenheim, Germany) as described,27 under the following conditions: 50 mM Tris ≠ HCl (pH 8.0), 154 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) ethanol and addition of CaCl2 (10 mM) at 25 8C using different concentrations of substrate and inhibitor. Benzamidine (1) was purchased from Merck KGaA, inhibitor (2) was kindly provided by Merck KGaA, while inhibitors (3) and (4) were kindly provided by ® ® Dr Jorg Sturzebecher. Ki values were determined as described.28 For inhibition measurements using (3), care was taken to standardise the time between solution of the inhibitor and measurement of Ki values. Crystallisation, data collection and structure analysis Prior to co-crystallisation, trypsin variants were preincubated for several hours with 10 mg/ml of inhibitor in 1 mM HCl, 10 mM CaCl2. Co-crystallisation was carried out at room temperature using vapour-diffusion, with a final protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. The trigonal crystals A and orthorhombic closed crystals B grew in 0.1 M imidazole (pH 7 ≠ 8), 0.1≠ 0.3 M ammonium sulphate and 20 ≠ 30% (w/v) polyethyleneglycol 8000 after a few weeks.

under the same conditions at room temperature after three days, whereas crystals of X(triple.Glu)bT.D1 grew at 40 8C after about ten days. After measurement, the same X(triple.Glu)bT.D1 crystal was returned to the hanging drop containing saturating amounts of inhibitor (2) for three hours to produce X(triple.Glu)bT.D2. Crystallisation conditions for all variants are given in Table 2. Crystals were measured in glass capillaries at room temperature. X-ray data were collected in-house using an R-AxisIV˛˛ image plate system (MSC, Texas) installed on a Rigaku rotating anode generator, and evaluated with DENZO29 or CrystalCleare 1.3 (MSC, Texas). Starting coordinates were taken from Rauh et al.5 Conventional crystallographic refinement (rigid body, positional, temperature factor) was carried out using CNS30 and model building performed using O.31 Initial phases for the structure X(SSAI)bT.D1 of the new space group D were obtained by molecular replacement using CNS,30 with crystal structure X(SSAI)bT.A1 as search model. An additional sulphate group close to the 99 loop is found in this crystal form. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Tables 2 and 6. Calculation of DDG values Free energies of binding DG º 2RT ln Ki ﬁ were calculated from Ki values given in Table 1. To obtain the contribution for each loop, DDG values were averaged over all complementary pairs; e.g. for the 99 loop: DDG º trypsin 2 X99ﬁbtﬁ ˛ X190ﬁbT 2 X99=190ﬁbTﬁ ˛ XSSFIﬁbT 2 X99=175ﬁbTﬁ ˛ X175=190ﬁbT 2 X175=190=217ﬁbTﬁﬁ=4ﬁ giving both a mean value and standard deviation. As a test of validity, DG values for each inhibitor were calculated assuming a linear contribution from each loop to yield the calculated values shown in Table 4.
