Abstract The structural preferences of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol glycolipids with glucose, galactose, maltose, and cellobiose as sugar head group were investigated under near physiological conditions with Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and synchrotron radiation small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Whereas all glycolipids have a very high fluidity at temperatures above 0  C, the mono- and disaccharide compounds differ considerably in their aggregate structures. The monosaccharide compounds adopt only inverted hexagonal (HII ) structures in the temperature range 5­70  C, while the disaccharide compounds adopt only multilamellar structures. Since these and similar glycolipids are frequently found in nature, these data should be of relevance for the function of their host cell membranes. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Glycolipids, which have been found in a variety of living cells, belong to the important group of glycoconjugates and are essential components of cell membranes with a variety of functions as receptors, adherence factors and signal-receiving and -emitting molecules (Curatolo, 1987; Sheen et al., 1999). In particular diacylated glycolipids are found in several species ranging from various bacteria such as Acholeplasma laidlawii (Andersson et al., 1998), diverse mycobacteria (Hamid et al., 1998;

Saavedra et al., 2006), the lichen Dictyonema glabratum (Sassaki et al., 1999), and the red alga Chondria armata (Al Fadhli et al., 2006). Although their chemical structures have been established in many cases, their exact function and, in particular, the role of the fatty acid moiety and the influence of the structure of the sugar part, frequently remain unclear. In previous papers the structural polymorphisms of saturated diacyl and dialkyl glycosyl sugars were elucidated (Hinz et al., 1991; Kuttenreich et al., 1993; Mannock et al., 1988, 1994; Mannock and McElhaney, 1991) and a variety of phases was found depending on the detailed structure. In a series of papers, the group of Wieslander and Lindblom has analysed membrane lipids extracted from A. laidlawii and have found that 1,2-diacyl-monoglucoside

has the ability to form nonlamellar phases, whereas the diacylated compound with a diglucoside forms stable lamellar structures (Wieslander et al., 1978; Brentel et al., 1985; Lindblom et al., 1986; Lindblom and Rilfors, 1989; Eriksson et al., 1991; Hauksson et al., 1995). Here, we have synthesized glycolipids consisting of a glycolipid with a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol moiety, which is frequently found in nature, and the common sugar structures glucose, galactose, maltose, and cellubiose (chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1), and have recorded their gel to liquid crystalline phase behaviour as well as their aggregate structures by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and synchrotron radiation X-ray scattering (SAXS). Whereas the phase transition behaviour is similar for all compounds, the aggregate structures strongly depend on the sugar backbone.

2. Results and discussion Infrared spectra from the hydrated samples were taken on an ATR plate (Fig. 2). Clearly, the disaccharide lipids adsorb much more water than the monosaccharide compounds as can be deduced from the strong water OH stretching mode around 3300 cm-1 and the bending mode around 1642 cm-1 . The sugar modes are also characteristic for the monosaccharides (bands in the range 1030­1035 cm-1 and at 1081 cm-1 ) and disaccharides (bands in the range 1040­1045 cm-1 and at 1182 cm-1 ). The band typical for the C O ester stretching vibration is surprisingly strong for the galacto-compound, much weaker for the gluco-compounds, and not detectable for the disaccharide compounds where it is probably covered by the strong water band.

Fig. 2. Infrared ATR spectra of the hydrated dioleoyl-saccharides.

The gel to liquid crystalline (  ) phase behaviour of the hydrocarbon chains was determined by evaluating the peak position of the symmetric stretching vibration of the methylene groups. The four glycolipids (Fig. 3) exhibit high wavenumber values >2852.0 cm-1 in the entire temperature range, only below 0  C is there evidence for a decrease. The values typical for the gel phase (<2850 cm-1 ) only found, if at all, for the maltoside compound. Interestingly, the dioleoylglucoside exhibits a significant higher fluidity (higher wavenumbers) at all temperatures than the other compounds. The aggregate structures of the glycolipids were investigated by synchrotron radiation small-angle X-ray

scattering (SAXS). In Fig. 4 diffraction patterns are presented for the monosaccharide compounds, each at 5 and 70  C. All patterns are indicative for the existence of the inverted hexagonal phase HII . For example, for dioleoylglucoside at 5  C the reflections with spacings of 6.13, 3.56, 3.08, 2.33, 2.05, 1.78, and 1.69 nm be indexed can      as the 1, 1/ 3, 1/ 4, 1/ 7, 1/ 9, 1/ 12, 1/ 13 of the periodicity at 6.13 nm. A similar indexing holds true for dioleoyl-galactoside. With increasing temperature, the patterns are less well resolved and at 70 beside the   periodicity only two further reflections (1/ 3, 1/ 4) are observed. The results for the disaccharide compounds indicate a completely different structural polymorphism.

From the data the existence of exclusively multilamellar structures can be deduced from the occurrence of reflections at equidistant ratios (Fig. 5), with periodicities of 5.78 nm (dioleoyl-maltoside) and 5.83 nm

compounds versus temperature, including also measurements at 20 and 40  C. The periodicities of the HII structures are clearly strongly dependent on temperature, whereas those of the multilamellar structures vary only slightly. The observation that these pure uncharged disaccharide glycolipids form multi- and not unilamellar structures is interesting. It has been observed that uncharged phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine and phoshatidylethanolamine may form both, unilamellar and multilamellar structures, whereas charged compounds such as phosphatidylglycerols and phosphatidylserines preferentially form multilamellar stacks, due to the negative charged head groups and the bridging capacity of counter ions (Chapman, 1975; Lewis et al., 1989; Luzzati, 1968). Thus, an interaction between adjacent bilayers, i.e., the disaccharide backbones must take place, which is responsible for the formation of the multilamellar structure. Since diacylated glycolipids are frequently components of cellular membranes, their structural polymorphism is of relevance to their function. Their fluidity must adapt to that of the fluid host cell membranes, which in the case of dioleoyl lipids is fulfilled because of their high fluidity (Fig. 3) at physiological temperature. Moreover, the structural polymorphism in isolated form should also be of relevance for their behaviour in host cell membranes. The compounds with inverted structures such as the dioleoyl monosaccharides would represent a strong disturbance in a lamellar host cell membrane and could thus play an important role for processes at the site of membrane disturbances such as cell adhesion, cell signalling, etc. In contrast, the dioleoyl disaccharides would completely adapt to the lamellar structure of the host cell membrane and could contribute to membrane permeability. There are some data available concerning the structural polymorphism of diacylated mono- and disaccharides. Mannock and McElhaney (1991) synthesized diacylated galactopyranosyl compounds with saturated acyl chains with 10­20 carbon atoms. They found essentially lamellar gel to liquid crystalline phases and at higher temperatures also transitions into nonlamellar phases including cubic as well as inverted hexagonal phases. Hinz et al. (1991) and Kuttenreich et al. (1993) synthesized ether- and ester-linked monoacylated and diacylated glycolipids with various sugar parts such as glucose, galactose, mannose, maltose, or trimaltose, and found specific phase changes for the different glycolipids, in most cases lamellar gel to liquid crystalline phase changes, but in some cases also lamellar gel to inverted hexagonal phase changes. In

accordance with these investigations, the analysis of Lis and Quinn (1986) showed the existence of only gel phases, and even crystalline phases, for a saturated monogalactosyl­diacylglycerol system. Authors from the Umea University have studied the glycolipids derived from A. laudlawii in detail (Wieslander et al., 1978; Brentel et al., 1985; Lindblom et al., 1986; Lindblom and Rilfors, 1989; Eriksson et al., 1991; Hauksson et al., 1995). They found that the dominating membrane lipids were monoglucosyldiglyerides and diglucosyldiglycerides (Wieslander et al., 1978). In particular the dioleoyl polar lipids, except for monoglucosyldiglycerides, form lamellar phases, whereas the latter had preferences for cubic, inverted hexagonal, and fluid lamellar phases (Lindblom et al., 1986). These measurements were extended to mixtures of deuterated mono- and diglucoside diacyl lipids to understand how the membrane maintains a stable bilayer in response to changing growth conditions (Eriksson et al., 1991). Even more complex glycolipids were found having, among others, a further acyl chain bound to the first glucoside (Hauksson et al., 1994, 1995). Also in accordance with our present findings are the results from structural investigations on chloroplast galactolipids, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol and digalactosyldiacylglycerol, with a preference for the inverted hexagonal phase for the former and lamellar phases for the latter glycolipid (Brentel et al., 1985). As shown by Sturm et al. (2003) for monoglucosyl­diacylglycerol lipids from A. laidlawii, glycolipids seem moreover relevant with respect to the lateral organisation of membranes. In this context, the role of cubic phases and isotropic structures and their possible biological relevance was discussed by Lindblom and Rilfors (1989), the functional role of nonlamellar forming lipids by Epand (1996), and the role of nonlamellar phases of lipids for protein­membrane interactions by Kinnunen (1996). 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Materials The synthesis of investigated glycolipids has been published before in detail (von Minden et al., 2002). The chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1. 3.2. Sample preparation All glycolipid samples were prepared as aqueous suspensions in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7. For this, the glycolipids were suspended directly in buffer and were temperature-cycled three times between 5 and 70  C and

then stored for at least 12 h before measurement. To guarantee physiological conditions, the water content of the samples was usually around 95%. 3.3. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy The infrared spectroscopic measurements were performed on an IFS-55 spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). For phase transition measurements, the lipid samples were placed in a CaF2 cuvette with a 12.5 m Teflon spacer. Temperature-scans were performed automatically between a low initial temperature (-20  C to +10  C) and 70  C with a heating rate of 0.6  C/min. For measurement of hydrated lipid samples, these were spread on an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) Ge plate, and free water was evaporated. Every 3  C, 50 interferograms were accumulated, apodized, Fouriertransformed, and converted to absorbance spectra. For the evaluation of the gel to liquid crystalline phase behaviour, the peak position of the symmetric stretching vibration of the methylene band s (CH2 ) around 2850 cm-1 was taken, which is a sensitive marker of lipid order (Brandenburg et al., 1999). 3.4. X-ray diffraction X-ray diffraction measurements were performed at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) outstation at the Hamburg synchrotron radiation facility HASYLAB using the SAXS camera X33 (Koch, 1988). X-ray diffraction patterns, obtained with exposure times of 2 min using a linear gas proportional detector with delay line readout (Gabriel, 1977), were evaluated according to previously described procedures (Brandenburg et al., 1999). These allow to assign the spacing ratios to defined three-dimensional aggregate structures, from which the conformation of the individual molecules are deduced. In the diffraction patterns presented here, the logarithm of the scattering intensity log I(s) is plotted versus the scattering vector s = 2sin (/ (2 = scattering angle,  = wavelength = 0.15 nm), and the spacings d are calculated according to s = 1/d. The s-axis was calibrated with Ag-Behenate which has a periodicity of 5.84 nm. The lamellar and the inverted hexagonal phase are most relevant here. They are characterized by the following features: (1) Lamellar: The reflections are grouped in equidistant ratios, i.e., 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc. of the lamellar repeat distance dl . (2) Inverted hexagonal HII : This is a structure with two-dimensional geometry. The relation between

reciprocal spacing shkand lattice constant a is  shk = (2 h2 + k2 - hk)/ 3a (hk = Miller indices of the corresponding set of plane).    This gives rise reflections at 1/ 3, 1/ 4, 1/ 7, to   1/ 9, 1/ 12, 1/ 13, etc. of the basic periodicity  dh = 3a/2. Acknowledgements We thank G. von Busse for performing the infrared measurements.
