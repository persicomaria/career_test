Abstract The catalytic domain of bovine K1C3-galactosyltransferase (K3GalT), residues 80^368, have been cloned and expressed, in Escherichia coli. Using a sequential purification protocol involving a Ni2 affinity column followed by a UDPhexanolamine affinity column, we have obtained a pure and active protein from the soluble fraction which catalyzes the transfer of galactose (Gal) from UDP-Gal to N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) with a specific activity of 0.69 pmol/min/ng. The secondary structural content of K3GalT protein was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which shows that the enzyme has about 35% L-sheet and 22% K-helix. This predicted secondary structure content by FTIR spectroscopy was used in the protein sequence analysis algorithm, developed by the Biomolecular Engineering Research Center at Boston University and Tasc Inc., for the assignment of secondary structural elements to the amino acid sequence of K3GalT. The enzyme appears to have three major and three minor helices and five sheet-like structures. The studies on the acceptor substrate specificity of the enzyme, K3GalT, show that in addition to LacNAc, which is the natural substrate, the enzyme accepts various other disaccharides as substrates such as lactose and Gal derivatives, L-O-methylgalactose and L-Dthiogalactopyranoside, albeit with lower specific activities. There is an absolute requirement for Gal to be at the non-reducing end of the acceptor molecule which has to be L1C4-linked to a second residue that can be more diverse in structure. The kinetic parameters for four acceptor molecules were determined. Lactose binds and functions in a similar way as LacNAc. However, L-O-methylgalactose and Gal do not bind as tightly as LacNAc or lactose, as their Kia and KA values indicate, suggesting that the second monosaccharide is critical for holding the acceptor molecule in place. The 2P and 4P hydroxyl groups of the receiving Gal moiety are important in binding. Even though there is large structural variability associated with the second residue of the acceptor molecule, there are constraints which do not allow certain Gal-R sugars to be good acceptors for the enzyme. The L1C4-linked residue at the second position of the acceptor molecule is preferred, but the interactions between the enzyme and the second residue are likely to be non-specific. ß 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

oligosaccharides. Several GTs exist, each being unique in the type of linkage it generates upon the transfer of Gal, with the most common linkages observed being 1C3 and 1C4. In addition, the con¢guration of the anomeric carbon of Gal introduces even more variety into the types of glycosidic linkages formed so that the following types of linkages can occur: K1C4, L1C4, K1C3 and L1C3. Bovine mammary gland L1C4-galactosyltransferase (L4GalT) was the ¢rst GT to be cloned and studied [1^5], which was followed by the cloning of K1C3galactosyltransferase (K3GalT) [6^8]. The K3GalT catalyzes the transfer of Gal from UDP-Gal to N-acetyllactosamine (GalL1C4GlcNAc, LacNAc), producing the trisaccharide GalK1C3GalL1C4GlcNAc. Unlike the L4GalT reaction, in which the con¢guration at the C1 atom of Gal is inverted, the K3GalT reaction retains the con¢guration at the C1 atom. The L4GalT has been extensively studied for its donor and acceptor specificities [9^12] and is stimulated by the modi¢er protein K-lactalbumin for the transfer of Gal to glucose (Glc) [13,14] and references reviewed in [15]. The K3GalT is unresponsive to K-lactalbumin. The enzyme puri¢ed from calf thymus [16,17] and produced by recombinant methods [18^20], has been previously analyzed for its substrate speci¢city. In addition to its preferred disaccharide, LacNAc, K3GalT is unique amongst other GTs in that it appears to accept several substrates [16,19]. The two enzymes, K3GalT and L4GalT, show very little sequence similarity except in a short stretch of sequence within their catalytic domains [6,21]. The K3GalT enzyme is responsible for the production of the K-galactosyl epitope in the sequence GalK1C3GalL1C4GlcNAc of many mammalian oligosaccharides. This enzyme is not expressed in humans, apes and old world primates due to gene inactivation by two frame shift mutations [6,22^24]. Humans, however, express an enzyme that transfers Gal only to K1C2-fucosylated substrate, FucK1C2Gal, producing the human B antigen, GalK1C3(FucK1C2)Gal. The presence of the Kgalactosyl epitope in the sequence GalK1C3GalL1C4GlcNAc-R, present on the surface of most mammalian endothelial cells leads to hyperacute rejection of the transplant during xenotransplantation due to reaction with anti-K-galactosyl epi-

tope antibodies found in humans, apes and other old world primates [25]. These antibodies, in humans, are produced under normal conditions in response to bacteria which reside in the gastrointestinal tract and display K-galactosyl-like epitopes [26]. We have cloned, expressed and puri¢ed the bovine K3GalT and examined the nature of its active site. Using various substrates as acceptors we have correlated the speci¢c activity of the enzyme with the preferred conformation of the substrates derived by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. We have also utilized Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to determine the secondary structure content of K3GalT. Using the protein sequence analysis (PSA) algorithm, developed by the Biomolecular Engineering Research Center at Boston University and Tasc Inc., along with the predicted secondary structure content of the protein by FTIR analysis, we have assigned the secondary structural elements to the primary sequence. 2.

cleotides were from the recombinant DNA laboratory, National Cancer Institute. 2.2. Ampli¢cation of K3GalT catalytic domain The following primers were used for the PCR ampli¢cation of the cDNA region corresponding to amino acids 80^368 of K3GalT, which have been shown to be the minimum number of residues required for its enzymatic activity [27]. 5PPrimer: 5P GAAAGCAAGCTTAAGCTATCGGACTGGTTCAAC 3P; 3Pprimer 5P TCAGACATTATTTCTAACCACATTATACTC 3P. Following the PCR ampli¢cation, the DNA fragment corresponding to K3GalT was excised from a low melting agarose gel and served as a template for the second PCR ampli¢cation with the following primers which introduced a BamHI restriction site and six residue histidine tag on the 5P end and an EcoRI restriction site on the 3P end of the ampli¢ed DNA. 5PPrimer: 5P CGCGGATCCGCGCACCACCACCACCACCACGAAAGCAAGCTTAAG 3P; 3Pprimer: 5P CCGGAATTCCGGTCAGACATTATTTCTAACCACATTATA 3P. The PCR ampli¢ed fragment was digested sequentially with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into a pET23a vector, which was also prepared by digestion with the two restriction enzymes in the same manner. The plasmid pET23a-K3GalT-d79 containing the correct insert was identi¢ed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. 2.3. Site-directed mutagenesis Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol using Clontech's Site-Directed Mutagenesis Transformer Kit. Construction of the double mutant, K307Q/K308A, was done using pET23a-K3GalT-d79 as the template plasmid (see above). The transformation mixture contained the template plasmid, a selection primer (pNotApa) and the mutagenic primer K307Q/ K308A with the following sequence: 5P pGCTTCAAAGGGATCCTCAAGGACCAGGCAAATGACATAGAAGCCC 3P. This primer also introduces another BamHI restriction site in the plasmid which was used for screening for the incorporated mutation. The mutation was further con¢rmed by DNA

sequence analysis of the insert in the plasmid K307Q/ K308A-pET23a-K3GalT-d79. 2.4. Bacterial strains and growth conditions Bacterial growth and plasmid transformations were performed using standard procedures [28]. Wild type and mutant constructs of K3GalT were expressed in E. coli DH5K supercompetent cells. All clones were grown in Luria^Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 Wg/ml ampicillin at 37³C as described [28,29]. Clones which were positive for the desired insertion or mutation were transformed into HMS174(DE3) cells as described [29,30]. 2.5. Expression and puri¢cation of recombinant wild type and mutant proteins A 100 ml overnight culture of HMS174(DE3) cells containing the desired plasmid was diluted to one liter using LB broth and ampicillin (¢nal concentration was 100 Wg/ml). At an OD of 0.7 at A600 , isopropyl L-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a ¢nal concentration of 1 mM to induce protein production. The culture was grown at 37³C for an additional 4 h at which time cells were harvested by centrifugation at 600Ug for 10 min. The cells were frozen in a dry ice^ethanol bath for 1.5 h and then allowed to thaw completely. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml equilibration/binding bu¡er (20 mM Tris^HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM immidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme) and vigorously shaken for 10 min. DNAse I was added (2 Wg/ml) and the cell mixture was shaken at 37³C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 27 000Ug for 20 min. The supernatant, which contains soluble proteins, was passed through a His-Bind column (Novagen) at 4³C. The column was ¢rst charged and washed as per the manufacturer's protocol and then equilibrated with three bed volumes of equilibration/binding bu¡er. The supernatant was passed through the column twice and subsequently washed with six bed volumes of equilibration/binding bu¡er. The protein was eluted with six bed volumes of elution bu¡er (20 mM Tris^ HCl, 0.5 M NaCl and 100 mM immidazole). A UDP-hexanolamine-agarose (Sigma) column was used to further purify the protein. Mn2 was

225

added (25 mM) to the pooled elutions from the HisBind column. The column was equilibrated using three bed volumes of equilibration/washing bu¡er B (25 mM PIPES, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM MgCl2 , 1.0% Triton X-100, 50 mM MnCl2 ). The protein sample was passed through the column twice and washed with four bed volumes of equilibration/ wash bu¡er B. The protein was eluted from the column with six bed volumes of elution bu¡er B (25 mM PIPES, 25 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl) and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris^HCl, pH 7.0 and 150 mM NaCl. 2.6. Enzymatic assay for K3GalT Reactions were carried out at 37³C for 15 min in a 100 Wl volume containing 5 mM MnCl2 , 5 mM Tris^ HCl (pH 7.0), 50 WM UDP-Gal and 10 mM sugar acceptors. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 Wl ice-cold water to the incubation mixture and passed through 0.5 ml of AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin (Bio Rad) in a scintillation vial. Next, the resin was washed sequentially with 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 ml of water. Twenty ml Ecoscint A scintillation solution (National Diagnostics) was added to each vial and the radioactivity counted in a Beckman LS 3801 liquid scintillation counter. One unit of enzyme activity is de¢ned as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of 1 Wmol of Gal from UDP-Gal to LacNAc at 37³C. 2.7. Kinetic analysis for K3GalT For kinetic analysis of the enzyme, ¢ve di¡erent concentrations of the donor, UDP-Gal, in the range of 5 to 75 WM, and six di¡erent concentrations of the acceptor sugar were used in a range that allowed for an accurate Michaelis^Menten plot to be derived. Data were analyzed for a two-substrate system using Eq. 1, similar to the method used by Seto et al. [31,32]. v vAB K ia K B  K B A  K A B  AB 1

2.8. Analysis of protein secondary structure by FTIR Protein was concentrated using Centriprep YM-10 from Millipore by centrifugation at 8000Ug to 6 mg/ ml in a bu¡er containing 20 mM Tris^HCl, pH 7.0 and 150 mM NaCl. Filtrates were saved and used for subtracting the background during spectral analysis. FTIR spectra were measured on the PROTA FTIRprotein analyzer from Bomem, equipped with the Arid-Zone purge system, non-hygroscopic ZnSe beamsplitter and DTGS detector. The spectrometer was continuously purged with dry air. The resolution used was 4 cm31 and all spectra were collected for 25 min. Two di¡erent cells were used for measurements. One cell, composed of two CaF2 windows and a 6 Wm mylar spacer (Specac) was assembled, bu¡er (¢ltrate) collected and vacuum dried, followed by an acquisition of a protein spectrum. That is, the cell was not taken apart between the measurements of bu¡er and protein spectra in order to preserve a constant pathlength. The second cell (BioTools), originally designed by Venyaminov et al. [33], is formed between a perfectly £at, optically clear CaF2 disc and another CaF2 disc, the center of which had been deepened to form a recessed parallel surface surrounded by a groove. The cell pathlength is 5.3 Wm. This cell is assembled and disassembled between the bu¡er and protein measurements but since no spacer is used, the pathlength reproducibility is very good and can be adjusted by comparing the signal beam spectra. The sample volume for both cells is approximately 10 Wl. The H2 O based bu¡er (¢ltrate) spectrum was subtracted from the protein spectrum using an automated subtraction algorithm in PROTA [34]. Each sample was measured at least twice. Secondary structure calculations were done using PROTA's database and programs and are based on the work of Keiderling et al. [35,36]. Second derivative spectra [37] were calculated in PROTA using algorithms developed by Spectrum Square Associates (Ithaca, NY, USA). 2.9. MD simulations of the substrates The calculations were performed using MacroModel (MacroModel, Columbia University, NY, USA) employing an MM3 force ¢eld [38]. MD simulations of L-O-methylgalactose, IPTG, lactulose, mellibiose,

EnzFitter Program, a non-linear curve ¢tting program for Windows from Biosoft, was used to obtain the kinetic parameters KA , KB , Kia and vmax , from the ¢tted curves using the above rate equation.

LacNAc and lactose were carried out with inclusion of the solvent e¡ect (water solution) utilizing the GB/ SA continuum solvation model. The length of MD simulations was 2 ns for each molecule and a constant temperature of 300 K was maintained during the simulations. An integration time step of 1 fs was used and coordinates were saved every picosecond. From saved MD trajectories, several lowest energy conformers were selected and geometries of these conformers were optimized. The lowest energy conformer from optimized structures was used for superposition. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Construction, expression and puri¢cation of recombinant bovine K3GalT The bacterial clone containing plasmid construct pET23a-K3GalT-d79 was induced to produce K3GalT protein. The sequence of the expressed protein without the six residue histidine tag is shown in Fig. 1. The induced protein in the bacteria remains mostly in the soluble fraction upon cell lysis from where it was puri¢ed sequentially on a Ni2 -agarose column and UDP-hexanolamine column and subsequently dialyzed. The yield of the ¢nal puri¢ed pro-

tein was V3 mg from 1 l culture. Dialysis against 20 mM Tris^HCl (pH 7.0) alone precipitates the protein in a relatively short period of time. After examining the protein on an isoelectric focusing gel (pH 3^10), two bands appear, each band constituting approximately 50% of total observed protein, which are one pH unit apart. In an attempt to obtain only one isoform of the enzyme, the protein from the UDPhexanolamine column was dialyzed against 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris^HCl, pH 7.0. This gave a single protein band, on both SDS^PAGE and isoelectric focusing gels. In addition, precipitate formation also decreased signi¢cantly, indicating that the higher ionic strength favors one isoform over another, most likely the active form since the speci¢c activity of protein in 150 mM NaCl was higher than the sample devoid of NaCl. Therefore, it can be assumed that a dynamic equilibrium is present between two distinct forms of K3GalT which are dependent on salt concentration and as the salt concentration is increased, the active isoform predominates. The FTIR spectrum of the protein sample in low salt concentrations could not be determined due to the aggregation and precipitation of the protein in solution. The N-terminal sequence of the puri¢ed protein showed that after six histidine residues the amino acid sequence ESKLKL appeared, which corre-

sponds to the sequence of K3GalT starting at residue number 80 in Fig. 1. The speci¢c activity of the enzyme is 0.6 U/mg of puri¢ed protein, with LacNAc as an acceptor, which is about 1/5 of the activity reported for the recombinant enzyme produced in the baculovirus system [18]. The enzyme puri¢ed from calf thymus [16] and the recombinant enzyme produced in E. coli by Fang et al. [27] have been shown to have higher activities than reported here or by Joziasse et al. [18]. Since the puri¢ed protein in the present study shows a single band on SDS as well as on isoelectric focusing gels (at high salt concentrations) and the salt concentrations can in£uence the activity of the enzyme (see above), we assume that the di¡erences in the speci¢c activity of the enzyme reported in the literature may be due to the di¡erences in assay conditions used by di¡erent groups or due to some modi¢cations introduced on the protein in di¡erent expression systems. 3.2. Secondary structure prediction FTIR spectroscopy has been widely used in studies of secondary structural composition of proteins [39^ 45]. The technique involves analysis of the conformationally sensitive amide I band, which results primarily due to the stretching vibrations of the protein backbone CNO bond. The nature of the hydrogen bonds involving the CNO and N^H groups of the peptide bond, in addition to the protein backbone geometry, determine the nature of the amide I band [46,47] and, therefore, are indicative of the secondary structures of proteins. Using FTIR spectroscopy and the PSA software (PSA, Biomolecular Engineering Research Center, Boston University and TASC, Reading, MA, USA), we have predicted the secondary structure of K3GalT and applied it to the primary sequence (Fig. 1). The second derivative and FTIR absorbance spectra of the puri¢ed K3GalT in 20 mM Tris^HCl, pH 7.0 and 150 mM NaCl are shown in Fig. 2. These spectra are typical of a protein with a high content of mixed K-helix and L-sheet structure. The main bands observed at 1620 and 1660 cm31 are usually assigned to those conformations. The factor analysis results [35] predict the structure to contain approximately 35% L-sheet and 22% K-helical content. These values were used to obtain the cut-o¡ values for the probabilities of each residue

being in an K-helix and L-sheet structure predicted with the protein secondary structure algorithm (PSA) [48^50] (Fig. 3). The amino acid residues that had the probabilities above the set cut-o¡s were assigned their appropriate secondary structure elements (Fig. 1). The secondary structure of the sequence reveals three major helices in addition to three minor ones. There also appear to be ¢ve sheet-like structures, consisting of three or four strands each. Of course, the exact nature of the sheets and the number of strands may be inaccurate because the exact fold of the molecule is unknown. Recently, the structure and fold of K3GalT was modeled based on the known structures of the nucleotide sugar-binding domains of proteins in the PDB database [51]. The modeled structure predicts that the enzyme consists of alternating K-helices and L-strands which in most part are in good agreement with the secondary structure predictions based on the spectroscopic data presented, except for the regions of amino acids 200^220 and 259^267. The di¡erences are due to di¡erent secondary structure prediction methods used. In the secondary structure prediction by the PSA algorithm we have used the constraints such that the cut-o¡ values for the secondary structure element of a residue ¢t the overall secondary structure element prediction from the spectroscopic method. This may be the reason that the regions of amino acids 200^220 and

259^267 have given the structural elements that di¡er from those reported by Imberty et al. [51]. 3.3. Metal dependency of K3GalT A variety of divalent metal cations can activate K3GalT with di¡erent acceptors, albeit at lower rates compared to the preferred manganese (Mn2 ) ion (Table 1). When LacNAc is used as a substrate, cobalt (Co2 ) is 83% as e¡ective as Mn2 , while iron (Fe2 ), cadmium (Cd2 ) and magnesium (Mg2 ) are less e¡ective. The activation can vary depending on the acceptor used as shown in Table 1. Metal ions, Mg2 and Zn2 are less e¤cient in activating the enzyme than Mn2 when LacNAc is used as the ac-

ceptor and even less e¤cient when L-O-methylgalactose is used as the acceptor. The use of more than one metal ion is not uncommon to GTs. L4GalT, for example, can use a variety of metal ions in place of the preferred Mn2 ion [52]. The Mn2 saturation curve for the transfer of Gal to LacNAc by K3GalT is sigmoidal. This type of graph shows that there are at least two activating metal binding sites on the enzyme which is concurrent with earlier ¢ndings [53]. 3.4. Acceptor speci¢city of K3GalT The acceptor speci¢city of bovine K3GalT has been previously studied [16,17,19] and it has been

The concentrations of UDP-Gal and metal ions were, 50 WM and 5 mM, respectively, and acceptors LacNAc and L-O-methylgalactose were 10 mM each. Relative activities of 100% correspond to speci¢c activities of 0.61 and 0.11 pmol min31 ng31 for the acceptors LacNAc and L-O-methylgalactose, respectively.

shown that the enzyme utilizes a range of sugar acceptors and their derivatives, suggesting that the enzyme has a broad acceptor speci¢city, just as the enzyme obtained from Trypanosoma brucei [20]. It has been suggested that a Gal moiety on the acceptor molecule is an absolute requirement for the transfer of Gal from UDP-Gal by the enzyme. In addition to Gal and its derivatives we have used talose (Tal) and Glc as acceptor molecules to determine which hydroxyl groups are important in binding the Gal residue (Table 2). Since neither Tal nor Glc display any signi¢cant activity, it can be inferred that the C2 and C4 hydroxyl groups on Gal are critical for the activity of the enzyme. In addition to the absolute requirement for Gal, the residue on the reducing end of the Gal moiety can be more diverse in structure (Table 2). There appear to be some constraints, however. Lactulose (GalL1C4Fru) which appears at least spatially to be similar to other highly active substrates (Fig. 4), interacts less favorably with the enzyme (Table 2) which may be due to the steric hindrances caused by the CH2 OH groups on fructose. We also wanted to test if the enzyme was able to accommodate disaccharides containing a linkage other than the L1C4 linkage. Melibiose (GalK1C6Glc) displays only 4% activity compared to LacNAc, suggesting that a disaccharide with L1C4 linkage is a preferred substrate. Additional evidence supporting the importance of the disaccharide linkage is the inability of GlcNAc to stimulate K3GalT activity when Gal and GlcNAc are provided together as the acceptor substrate. This implies that providing the enzyme with both components of a disaccharide is not enough and that the linkage be-

tween the anomeric carbon of the ¢rst monosaccharide and the second sugar is indeed important. The superposed minimum energy structures of the substrates that were tested show that in the active substrates C2, C3 and C4 atoms of the L-linked monosaccharide moiety of the disaccharide superimpose and face towards one side of the molecule (Fig. 4), which may contribute to additional interactions with the enzyme. In addition, a hydrophobic

Concentrations of UDP-Gal, Mn2 and sugar acceptors were 50 WM, 5 and 10 mM, respectively. Relative activity of 100% corresponds to a speci¢c activity of 0.69 pmol min31 ng31 for the LacNAc acceptor. a The speci¢c activity of the double mutant K307Q/K308A of K3GalT remains the same as for the wild type K3GalT for LacNAc and human blood group H substrate, FucK1C2Gal.

patch created by C3H, C5H and C6H2 on the Glc moiety of lactose or GlcNAc moiety of LacNAc, may also be required for interactions with the enzyme. In the same area, a hydrophobic patch is created by the CH-(CH3 )2 moiety of the IPTG molecule which may contribute to its higher speci¢c activity towards the enzyme compared to Gal or L-O-methylgalactose. This suggests that besides the absolute

requirement for the Gal moiety, a hydrophobic residue which is linked via a L-glycosidic bond to Gal, that ¢ts in the site adjacent to the Gal binding site on the enzyme, enhances the activity of the enzyme. This hypothesis is in accord with the kinetic data which shows that the true Km for LacNAc and lactose is several fold lower than for Gal and L-O-methylgalactose (Table 3) (see Section 3.5).

KA and KB , the true Km of acceptor and donor, respectively, and Kia and kcat were obtained by two substrate analysis using the primary plots of ¢ve concentrations of donor (UDP-Gal) and six concentrations of acceptor and the corresponding secondary plots of the intercepts and slopes. Initial rate conditions were linear with respect to time. A suitable range, one which fell mostly in the linear portion of the Michaelis^Menten plot, for each substrate was identi¢ed and used for the primary and secondary plots, as well for the analysis with the EnzFitter Program (Biosoft) using the formula given in Section 2.

3.5. Kinetic parameters for various substrates of K3GalT The enzymatic mechanism of L4GalT1 has been proposed to be a random equilibrium mechanism [54]. The kinetic mechanism of K3GalT is not known. We have analyzed the steady state kinetic data of K3GalT with LacNAc, lactose, L-O-methylgalactose and Gal as acceptor substrates at saturating concentrations of Mn2 (5 mM) in which the concentrations of both UDP-Gal and acceptor substrates were varied (Table 3). Using the equation for a two substrate system (Eq. 1), the true Km values (KA ) for LacNAc and lactose were determined to be very similar. The KA value, however, increases 20fold when L-O-methylgalactose is used as the acceptor molecule and almost 500 -fold when Gal is the acceptor. The Kia , the equilibrium dissociation constant for the acceptor molecule, also increases but at a much more dramatic rate. The Kia value for lactose compared to LacNAc increases 10-fold, while the Kia value for L-O-methylgalactose and Gal increase by 600- and 4000-fold, respectively. This suggests that the binding of UDP-Gal to the enzyme prior to acceptor binding aids in binding the acceptor more tightly to the enzyme. Furthermore, the UDP-Gal binding most likely a¡ects the binding of the second monosaccharide moiety of a disaccharide. The turnover number, kcat , can be in£uenced by rate-limiting substrate binding or the product release step and, therefore, the speci¢city constants, kcat /KA and kcat / KB which combine rate and binding, are a more accurate measure of the e¤ciency of a reaction. Our results suggest that the second residue in a disaccharide is critical for binding and the resulting catalytic

e¤ciency as is evident by the sharp decline in kcat /KA , using Gal as the acceptor. Although the acceptor speci¢city of K3GalT is broad, the binding and the catalytic machinery of the enzyme are indeed a¡ected by interchanging various acceptor substrates. The KB value, the true Km for UDP-Gal at in¢nite concentrations of the acceptor and Kib , the equilibrium dissociation constant for UDP-Gal, do not change as dramatically as the acceptor binding parameters, indicating that the acceptor binding site is not associated with the donor binding site and that the e¡ect of UDP-Gal binding on the acceptor binding site is more profound than the e¡ect of the acceptor binding site on the donor site. This is also evident when the speci¢city constant, kcat /KB , is compared for the four di¡erent substrates. The range is 8^10 s31 mM31 , indicating that the various acceptor sugars do not hinder UDP-Gal binding or alter its role in catalysis. 3.6. Mutation of the DKKN sequence in K3GalT The DKKN sequence, present in K3GalT (Fig. 1) and in L4GalT1, has been implicated in substrate binding of these enzymes [21]. The corresponding sequence in the human blood group B enzyme is DQAN. Based on our secondary structure prediction (Fig. 3), this sequence in K3GalT is located at the end of a helix, near a turn, which is a common location for substrate binding motifs of many enzymes. We created a double mutant of K3GalT, K307Q/ K308A, where Lys-307 was mutated to Gln-307, and Lys-308 to Ala-308, with a hope that K3GalT may accept human blood group H substrate (FucK1C2Gal) as the acceptor molecule and thereby

acquire a property of the human blood group B enzyme. However, both enzymes, the double mutant K307Q/K308A and the wild type K3GalT, did not show any activity towards the substrate FucK1C2Gal. On the other hand, the mutant enzyme had the same activity towards LacNAc as the wild type, suggesting that KK residues of DKKN sequence are not involved in the sugar acceptor binding site. Furthermore, these results show that the C2 hydroxyl group on Gal has to be free and is critical for the activity of the enzyme.
