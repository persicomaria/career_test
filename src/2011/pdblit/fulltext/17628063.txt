The effective lifetime of -lactams as antibiotics can be extended by concurrent treatment of patients with -lactamase inhibitors.1,2 The -lactamase inhibitors in commercial production at present, however, are of limited spectrum and are largely specific to the class A enzymes.1 New classes of inhibitor with broader specificity covering classes B, C, and D -lactamases would be welcome since the prevalence of these enzymes, and thus -lactam resistance among bacteria, continues to grow. We describe in this communication a new type of -lactamase inhibitor with an unusual mechanism of action involving the covalent cross-linking of active side residues. The depsipeptides of general structure 1 are -lactamase substrates.3,4 Although the aza analogues 2 display little or no substrate activity,5 we were encouraged to try the oxa analogues 3 because of the inhibitory properties of vanadate/ hydroxamic acid complexes.6 Compounds 4 and 5 were therefore obtained from careful reaction of the appropriate hydroxamic acid and chloroformate (the latter carboxyl-protected in the case of 5) in the presence of imidazole (Supporting Information). An alkoxy side chain was chosen since the alkyl or aryl analogues were unstable to the Lossen ¨ rearrangement.7 An NMR spectrum of 15N-4 in DMSO-d6 showed a 15N resonance at 161.1 ppm coupled (J ) 93 Hz) to a proton at 11.75 ppm. This clearly identifies the product as the O-acyl rather than N-acyl hydroxamic acid. Compounds 4 and 5 hydrolyzed in aqueous buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH 7.5), yielding benzyl Nhydroxycarbamate, the phenol, and, presumably, bicarbonate; pseudo-first-order rate constants (k0) of 2.5 × 10-4 and 2.78 × 10-4 s-1, respectively, were obtained.

Compound 4 inhibited, essentially irreversibly, the class C -lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99 in a time-dependent fashion, as evident from Figure 1. At low inhibitor/enzyme concentration ratios, the final activity of the enzyme was not zero, which suggested that some turnover accompanied the inhibition reaction (background hydrolysis of 4 was not sufficient to explain the final activity). A greater excess of inhibitor did completely inactivate the enzyme (Figure 1). A plot of residual activity versus concentration of 4 (Figure 2) suggested that about two turnovers accompanied inhibition. These data were fitted to Scheme 1, where EI is likely to be a hydrolyzable acyl enzyme4 which can also partition to a dead end complex EI. These fits, shown as solid

Experiments analogous to those described above yielded values of k1 and k2/k3 of 5.4 ( 0.3 × 103 s-1 M-1 and 1.00 ( 0.05, respectively.

S1, Supporting Information). Lys73 remains hydrogen bonded to Tyr150 O . Coordinates of the structure have been deposited in the RCSB protein data bank as entry 2P9V. The mechanism of inhibition of the P99 -lactamase by 4 and 5 can thus, from the data available at present, be represented by the sequence shown in Scheme 2. This represents a novel cross-linking of the active site and a previously unobserved specific modification of one of the two conserved lysine residues of the -lactamase active site. Inhibition of class A -lactamases by clavulanic acid and penicillin sulfones has been shown to involve cross-linking of the active site serine to the conserved Ser130.11,12 We have also observed that 4 and 5, and other derivatives of these compounds, inhibit the class A TEM -lactamase. We plan further experiments to determine the scope of these compounds against -lactam-recognizing enzymes. Acknowledgment.

stituent, is not a better inhibitor than 4. This result is contrary to what would be expected from comparable substitution in the depsipeptides 1. A m-carboxy group in 1 is thought to interact specifically with the P99 active site.8 The results suggest that 1 and 5 may not bind to the active site in the same way. It should be noted, however, that inactivation of the enzyme by 5 was competitively inhibited by p-nitrobenzene boronic acid, which is itself a competitive inhibitor of the P99 enzyme.9 An electrospray mass spectrum of the inhibited enzyme was obtained. Enzyme (10 µM) and 4 (5 mM) were incubated together in MOPS buffer (above) for 5 min, after which time the enzyme was inactive. The protein was then precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed, and dried, and an ES+ mass spectrum obtained. The spectrum showed an increase in protein mass of 29, in good agreement with the mechanism of inactivation described below. A 1.8 Å resolution crystal structure of the inhibited AmpC class C -lactamase was also obtained, as described in the Supporting Information. The only observable difference from the structure of the native enzyme10 was at the active site. In monomer A of the structure, the O oxygen of Ser64 is flipped some 180° (Ser64CRC OC) and forms part of an unprecedented carbamate bridge to N of Lys315 (Figure 3). Tyr150 has moved aside slightly to accommodate insertion of a carbonyl, but O remains within hydrogen-bonding distance of the inserted carbonyl oxygen (Figure
