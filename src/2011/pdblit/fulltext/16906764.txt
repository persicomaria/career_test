ABSTRACT: Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase) catalyzes the committed step in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, the reaction between carbamoyl phosphate (CP) and L-aspartate to form N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate and inorganic phosphate. The enzyme exhibits homotropic cooperativity and is allosterically regulated. Upon binding L-aspartate in the presence of a saturating concentration of CP, the enzyme is converted from the low-activity low-affinity T state to the high-activity high-affinity R state. The potent inhibitor N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), which combines the binding features of Asp and CP into one molecule, has been shown to induce the allosteric transition to the R state. In the presence of only CP, the enzyme is the T structure with the active site primed for the binding of aspartate. In a structure of the enzyme-CP complex (TCP), two CP molecules were observed in the active site approximately 7Å apart, one with high occupancy and one with low occupancy. The high occupancy site corresponds to the position for CP observed in the structure of the enzyme with CP and the aspartate analogue succinate bound. The position of the second CP is in a unique site and does not overlap with the aspartate binding site. As a means to generate a new class of inhibitors for ATCase, the domain-open T state of the enzyme was targeted. We designed, synthesized, and characterized three inhibitors that were composed of two phosphonacetamide groups linked together. These two phosphonacetamide groups mimic the positions of the two CP molecules in the TCP structure. X-ray crystal structures of ATCaseinhibitor complexes revealed that each of these inhibitors bind to the T state of the enzyme and occupy the active site area. As opposed to the binding of Asp in the presence of CP or PALA, these inhibitors are unable to initiate the global T to R conformational change. Although the best of these T-state inhibitors only has a Ki value in the micromolar range, the structural information with respect to their mode of binding provides important information for the design of second generation inhibitors that will have even higher affinity for the active site of the T state of the enzyme.

Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase (E.C. 2.1.3.2, ATCase1) catalyzes the committed step in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, the reaction between carbamoyl phosphate (CP) and L-aspartate, to form N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate and inorganic phosphate. The reaction is ordered with CP binding before L-aspartate and N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate leaving before inorganic phosphate (1). E. coli ATCase exhibits cooperativity with respect to the second substrate aspartate (2) and exerts allosteric control over the rate of pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism. The enzyme is allosterically inhibited by the end products of the pathway, CTP (3) and UTP in the presence of CTP (4), and allosterically activated by ATP (3), the product of the parallel purine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. The homotropic and heterotropic properties of the enzyme are manifest by the ability of the enzyme to switch between a low-activity low-affinity T state and a high-activity high-affinity R state.

E. coli ATCase is composed of 12 polypeptide chains. The six larger chains (Mr 34 000) are grouped into two trimers, and the six smaller chains (Mr 17 000) are grouped into three dimers. The active sites are located on the larger or catalytic chains, whereas the allosteric binding sites are located on the smaller or regulatory chains. The catalytic trimers and

T-state Inhibitors of Aspartate Transcarbamoylase regulatory dimers are stable, independent of each other. After separation, the catalytic trimers and regulatory dimers still retain catalytic activity and ability to bind the regulatory nucleotides, respectively. However, homotropic cooperativity is abolished. In mammalian cells, the first three steps in de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis are catalyzed by CAD, a multienzyme complex composed of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, ATCase and dihydroorotase (5). A sequence alignment of the catalytic chain of E. coli ATCase with the corresponding portion of CAD reveals that all of the amino acids involved in substrate binding and catalysis are fully conserved (6). No structural data is available for the CAD complex; however, the structure of E. coli ATCase has been determined in the T and R states in the presence and absence of substrates, substrate analogues, and nucleotide effectors (7-10). For the E. coli enzyme, the binding of Asp to the enzymeCP complex causes the two domains of the catalytic chain to close (10), which accelerates the reaction by approximation. This mechanism holds for both the holoenzyme as well as the isolated catalytic subunit and is hypothesized to occur in the ATCase portion of CAD as well. One of the best inhibitors of ATCase is N-phosphonacetylL-aspartate (PALA) (Ki 27 nM) (11). Biochemical and structural studies have shown that the addition of PALA induces the allosteric transition of the enzyme from the T to the R structure (8, 12, 13). The tight binding of PALA is most likely due to its resemblance to the tetrahedral intermediate in the reaction. Using the X-ray structure of the enzyme-PALA complex, it has been possible to replace PALA with the structure of the tetrahedral intermediate with little or no alterations to the positions of side chains in the active site (8). PALA has also been shown to be a good inhibitor of CAD in vitro (14, 15) and has been shown to stop the proliferation of cancer cells in culture (16). Although the structure of the E. coli ATCase-PALA complex (RPALA) is in the R-structural state, and the X-ray structure of the E. coli ATCase-CP complex (TCP) is in the T-structural state (10). In this structure, two molecules of CP are bound in each active site, one with full occupancy and the other with significantly lower occupancy. The high occupancy site corresponds to the position for CP observed in the structure of the enzyme with CP and the aspartate analogue succinate bound (17). The position of the second CP is a unique site and does not overlap the aspartate binding site (Figure 1). Because PALA contains in a single molecule the binding features of both aspartate and CP and is similar in structure to the tetrahedral intermediate of the reaction, PALA binds tightly to the domain-closed R state. As a means to generate a new class of inhibitors of aspartate transcarbamoylase targeted at the domain-open T state of the enzyme, we designed, synthesized, and characterized a series of compounds that were composed of two phosphonacetamide groups linked together. The two phosphonacetamide groups mimic the positions of the two CP molecules in the TCP structure. Our goal was to design inhibitors that would bind to the T state and, thereby, prevent the conversion of the enzyme to the R state, trapping the enzyme in the low-activity low-affinity T state.

T-state Inhibitors of Aspartate Transcarbamoylase Enzyme Preparation. E. coli ATCase holoenzyme and catalytic subunit were overexpressed utilizing E. coli strain EK1104 (F- ara, thi, (pro-lac), pyrB, pyrF(, rpsL) (19) containing plasmids pEK152 (20) and pEK17 (19). The isolation and purification were performed as described previously (19). The concentration of the holoenzyme and catalytic subunit was determined by A280 based upon extinction coefficients of 0.59 and 0.72 cm2 mg-1, respectively (21). The purity of the enzymes was checked by SDS-PAGE (22) and nondenaturing PAGE (23, 24). Crystallization and Freezing of Crystals. ATCase holoenzyme was crystallized by microdialysis, using 50 µL wells. The enzyme solution, at 18 mg/mL, was dialyzed against a solution of 40 mM citric acid, 3 mM sodium azide, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM cytidine 5-triphosphate, and 0.2 mM EDTA (pH 5.7) as previously described (25). The crystals grew to average dimensions of 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.1 mm within 2 weeks. For structure determination in the presence of inhibitors, enzyme crystals in a microdialysis chamber were dialyzed over 12 h against a crystallization buffer containing 5 mM inhibitor. Crystals were then transferred into a freezing solution containing 30% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol in crystallization buffer with 5 mM inhibitor for approximately one minute prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray Data Collection and Processing. The data for the structure for the three enzyme-inhibitor structures were collected using a Rigaku/MSC R-axis IV++ detector, whereas X-rays were generated using a Rigaku/MSC RU200 rotating-anode generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA at the Crystallographic Facility in the Chemistry Department of Boston College. The diffraction data were integrated, scaled, and averaged using d*TREK (26). Structural Refinement. The initial model for the T1, T2 and T3 structures was derived from the coordinates of the Tapo and TCP structure. Prior to refinement, all of the waters and ligands were removed. The refinement was carried out using CNS (27). After initial rigid body, simulated annealing, minimization, and B-factor refinement, initial maps were inspected. The 80's loop of the catalytic chain was disordered, and through several rounds of manual rebuilding, the catalytic chain was corrected using XtalView (28). Several cycles of corrections were made to the regulatory chains by repeatedly overlaying the previously published T-state structure, Tapo. After rebuilding the 80's loop and 240's loop of the catalytic chains, the inhibitors were fit into the difference density in the active site. Once manual rebuilding was complete, the placement of inhibitors was checked by simulated annealing omit maps calculated in CNS (27). Waters were added to the structure using CNS and XtalView on the basis of Fo-Fc electron density maps at or above the 2.5  level and were checked and retained only when they could be justified by hydrogen bonds. The model was checked for errors using PROCHECK (29). The details of data processing and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Automated Docking Procedure. The program AUTODOCK (30) was used for the automated docking of inhibitors to the active site. AUTODOCK was used both in the design of the inhibitors and as an aid in the placement of the inhibitors in the difference density of the final models. To have one complete active site, two adjacent catalytic chains were used for the docking procedure. The grid box was set at 30 Å3

centered at the middle of the active site, with a grid spacing of 0.275 Å between grid points. In each case, 50 docking runs were performed using the Genetic Algorithm with a maximum of 500 000 energy evaluations. Fluorescence Measurements. To determine if inhibitors 1, 2, and 3 were able to convert the enzyme from the T to the R state in solution, fluorescence spectroscopy was employed in conjunction with a pyrene-labeled version of ATCase that is sensitive to the quaternary structure of the enzyme (31). Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at 20 ( 1 °C in 50 mM Tris-acetate buffer at pH 8.3 on a Shimadzu 1000 spectrofluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was 338 nm, the emission wavelength collected was 350-600 nm, and the excitation and emission bandwidths were set to 5 nm. RESULTS Design and Modeling of Inhibitors. In the TCP structure of ATCase, two molecules of CP are observed in the active site, one with full occupancy and the other with significantly lower occupancy (Figure 1). The position of these two CP molecules in the T-state active site suggested that a new class of T-state inhibitors of ATCase might be designed by linking two phosphonacetamide units together. In the TCP structure, the carbonyl carbons of CP are 7.3 Å apart (Figure 1). On the basis of this separation distance, a number of inhibitor candidates were designed. AUTODOCK was used to provide possible orientations of these inhibitors in the active site and to calculate their relative affinities for the enzyme. Scrutiny of the AUTODOCK results for 1 bound in the active site revealed that if the aliphatic functionality that linked the two phosphonacetamide moieties was replaced with an aromatic ring, the resulting compound would not only be able to

Both 2 and 3 showed lower Ki values than 1, and 3 exhibited a slightly lower Ki value than 2, in good agreement with our design rationale. X-ray Structures of Aspartate Transcarbamoylase in the Presence of 1, 2, and 3. To better understand the mode of binding and any structural changes caused by the inhibitors, X-ray crystallography was employed. Crystals of the enzyme in the presence of 1, 2, and 3 diffracted to a maximal resolution of 2.0, 2.0, and 2.5 Å, respectively, in the P321 space group. The unit cell dimensions a ) b ) 120.59 and c ) 141.71 for 1, a ) b ) 119.94 and c ) 141.97 for 2, and a ) b ) 120.90 and c ) 141.61 for 3 (Table 1) are very similar to those observed for the crystals of the enzyme in the absence of CP (Tapo, a ) b ) 120.29 and c ) 142.55; pdb code 1ZA1). Details of the data collection and refinement of these three structures can be found in Table 1. The similarity in unit cell dimensions between T1, T2, T3, and Tapo structures suggests that the T1, T2, and T3 structures were in the same quaternary structure as Tapo. To more accurately determine the quaternary conformation of the T1, T2, and T3 structures, the vertical separation between the upper and lower catalytic subunits for each structure was determined (37). The vertical separations for the T1, T2, and T3 structures were 45.55, 44.89, and 45.25 Å, respectively. This compares to the vertical separation of the T state derived from the Tapo, TCP, and RPALA structures of 45.5, 45.9, and 56.2 Å, respectively. The vertical separation of T1, T2, and T3 structures is evidence that these three structures are globally in the T-quaternary conformation. Although the binding of PALA to ATCase induces the T to R transition, none of these inhibitors causes the quaternary conformational change. Because these inhibitors were soaked into T-state crystals, it may be argued that crystal packing forces hold the enzyme in the T state; however, when T-state crystals are soaked with PALA, the crystal disintegrates within a few seconds (unpublished observation). The T1, T2, and T3 structures were compared to the Tapo and TCP structures. Overall, the T1, T2, and T3 tertiary structures were closer to the Tapo than the TCP structure. For example, the C1 and C6 catalytic chains of the T1 structure compared to the same chains of the Tapo structure and had RMS deviations of 0.259 and 0.304 Å, respectively, whereas when compared to the same chains in the TCP structure, the RMS deviations were 0.987, and 0.915 Å respectively. The trend was the same for T2 and T3 structures as well. The 80's loop of both chains in the asymmetric unit in the T2 and T3 structures were in a novel conformation unlike that of either the 80's loop conformation in the Tapo or the TCP structures with largest differences seen between the T1 and TCP structures (Figure 3, T1-A, T3-A). Coordination of the Inhibitors in the ActiVe Site of the T1, T2, and T3 Structures. The coordination of the phosphonacetamide group of 1, 2, and 3 that most closely matched the position of CP or PAM in the active site was different than the coordination of CP and PAM in the TPAM and TCP structures. The most noteworthy differences were the hydrophobic interactions between Pro266 (not shown) and His134 and the phenyl ring of 2 (Figure 3B, T2-B) and the absence of backbone interactions to 3 from Leu267, Pro266, and Arg54 (Figure 3, T3-B).

increase the hydrophobic interactions with the 260's loop but also be able to improve the distance between the two carbonyls closer to the target distance of 7.3 Å. True to our hypothesis, AUTODOCK results indicated that 2 and 3 had better binding energies than PALA in the T state. On the basis of these AUTODOCK results, inhibitor candidates 1, 2, and 3 were synthesized (Figure 2). Inhibitor Synthesis. 1a, 2a, and 3a (Figure 2) were acylated with chloroacetic anhydride in the presence of pyridine (3234) to give 1b, 2b, and 3b, respectively. Refluxing the acylated products at 140 °C in triethyl phosphite (35) yielded 1c, 2c, and 3c, respectively. Final compounds 1, 2, and 3 were deprotected using bromotrimethylsilane in a single pot at 0 °C (36). Inhibition Studies. Because of homotropic cooperativity and strong substrate inhibition, only IC50 values could be determined for the ATCase holoenzyme. At pH 8.3 in 0.1 M Tris-acetate buffer, the IC50 values for 1, 2, and 3 were 200, 86, and 79 µM, respectively. A more detailed kinetic characterization of the inhibitors was performed on the catalytic subunit with respect to both substrates, Asp and CP. Inhibition constants were determined for compounds 1, 2, and 3, along with the known inhibitors PAM and PALA as controls. In these experiments, 1 behaved differently than 2 and 3. 1 was a relatively weak inhibitor (Table 2) and exhibited noncompetitive inhibition with respect to both Asp and CP, 2 and 3 had Ki values approximately 10-fold lower than 1, and both exhibited competitive kinetics with respect to both Asp and CP. The Ki values for the inhibition of the catalytic

Noteworthy in all three structures is an interaction between the inhibitor and Thr168, a residue that has not been observed to interact with substrate or substrate analogues in other ATCase structures (Figure 3B). In the T3 structure, Lys84, from an adjacent catalytic chain, interacts with the carboxylate (Figure 3, T3-B). In previous structures, Lys84 only interacts with substrates or substrate analogues in the R state. Finally, Arg296, which does not interact with substrates or substrate analogues in structures of the wild-type enzyme in the T state, interacts with 3 (Figure 3, T3-B). In addition to a more open conformation of the T-state active sites, there are some positional changes in active site residues compared to those in TPAM and TCP. The largest backbone differences in the active site besides Lys84 in the T3 structure are residues in the 50's region from Glu50 to Thr55. In the TCP and TPAM structures, Thr53 forms a backbone interaction with the substrate or substrate analogue; however, this interaction is not observed in any of the inhibitor structures reported here (Figure 3B). 3 Binds More Tightly to the Enzyme than 1 or 2. The presence of the hydrophobic phenyl connector ring between the two phosphonacetamide moieties of 2 and 3 hold the phosphate groups in a more rigid conformation, thus enhancing coordination in the ASP domain. For example, in the T3 structure, 3 is coordinated by five interactions involving Arg229 with Thr168 at hydrogen bonding distances less than 2.75 Å, significantly tighter interactions in the ASP domain than that for structures 1 and 2. The addition of the carboxylic acid also contributes to the binding of 3 by a specific inter-

action with Lys84 from the adjacent chain (Figure 3, T3-B). Figure 3C shows the two CP molecules in the active site of the TCP structure overlaid onto inhibitors 1, 2, and 3. This figure presents the differences in orientation of the phosphonactemide moieties of the three inhibitors compared to the two CP molecules in the active site. Additionally, significant side chain positional differences are seen in the CP and ASP domain when inspecting T1, T2, or T3 active sites with TCP overlaid, with the largest differences in the TCP and T3 overlay, most likely induced by the enhanced binding of the phosphonacetamide moiety of 3 (Figure 4). Determination of the Quaternary Structure of the Enzyme in the Presence of 1, 2, and 3. Using a pyrene-labeled version of ATCase, it is possible to use fluorescence spectroscopy to determine if substrates or inhibitors are able to convert ATCase from the T to the R state (31). This is made possible by the selective attachment of pyrene at position 241 in the catalytic chain. In the T state, the pyrene labels in the C1 and C4 catalytic chains are far apart, whereas in the R state, after the allosteric transition, they are close together. When two pyrenes are within 5-10 Å of each other, they show excimer emission (38). Thus, in the T state, there is no excimer emission, whereas in the R state, there is substantial excimer emission with a corresponding decrease in monomer emission. Shown in Figure 5A are the emission spectra of ATCase in absence (T-state) and presence of PALA (R-state). Upon adding PALA, the excimer peak at 490 nm increases dramatically, whereas the monomer peak (400 nm)

A cartoon representing the change between the TCP structure and the structure with the corresponding inhibitor bound is shown. The width of the tube is proportional to the RMS deviation of the R-carbon atom positions. Also shown is the 80's loop from the adjacent catalytic chain that contributes residues to the active site (80's Loop*) colored in green with the largest differences in the loop colored in magenta. Other regions of notable difference in the R-carbon atom positions of the C1 catalytic chain are residues 50-58, 229-233, and 266-271 (pink). This Figure was drawn with CHIMERA (43).

decreases. However, the addition of 1, 2, or 3 did not cause any increase in excimer fluorescence at 490 nm, indicating that these inhibitors cannot convert the enzyme to the R-state. DISCUSSION Figure 6A shows the Tapo active site of ATCase with two molecules of CP bound. Our goal in this project was to design, synthesize, and characterize both functionally and structurally a series of compounds that would completely fill the more open T-state active site of ATCase than the closed R-state active site and, thus, potentially lock the enzyme in the low-activity low-affinity T state. When 1, 2, and 3 bind to ATCase, the enzyme remains in the quaternary T structure as determined by both fluorescence measurements with the pyrene-labeled enzyme in solution (Figure 5), and by X-ray crystallography of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes.

The three inhibitors designed as 1, 2, and 3, each bind in the T-state active site and fill the active site pocket. For example, Figure 6B shows 3 bound in the active site on the basis of the T3 structure. The change of aliphatic functionality connecting the phosphonacetamide groups in 1 to the phenyl moieties in 2 and 3 (Table 2) enhances binding by promoting hydrophobic interactions with Pro266, Leu267, and Pro268. This enhanced binding and specificity was reflected in the significantly lower Ki values of 2 and 3 compared to that of 1. In addition, the lower Ki value of 3 over 2 can be attributed to the additional carboxylate functionality, which promotes the coordination of 3 with Lys84 from an adjacent catalytic chain (Figures 4 and 6B). The T3 structure also represents the first instance in which Lys84 from an adjacent chain has been observed to coordinate a substrate or a substrate analogue in a T-state structure.

The TCP and T3 structures were overlaid prior to calculating the surfaces. This Figure was drawn with CHIMERA (43).

Although 2 and 3 are reasonably good inhibitors of ATCase, neither one approaches the potency of PALA. This apparent inconsistency is due to the difference in the mode by which these inhibitors bind. When CP binds, it induces conformational changes that enhance its binding, which is an induced fit. This alteration in protein structure can be observed by comparing the Tapo and TCP structures (10). An induced fit also occurs when PAM binds, but the extent of the conformational change is significantly smaller than that when CP binds (39). The extent of the induced fit is even more extreme for PALA because PALA binding results in the closure of the two domains of the catalytic chain, which occurs in conjunction with the T- to R-quaternary conformational change (8). PALA binds in a tight complex to the R-quaternary of the enzyme, whereas the weak binding of PAM and CP alone is to the T-quaternary structure. The tertiary and quaternary conformations of the T1, T2, and T3

structures are actually closer to the Tapo structure than the TCP structure, suggesting that the binding of these inhibitors, even though they contain a phosphonacetamide functionality, cannot produce the same conformational change induced by the binding of the natural substrate CP or the substrate analogue PAM. Whereas the binding of CP weakens interactions that are required for the stabilization of the enzyme in the T-state, with side chains of the active site approaching their R-state conformation, inhibitors 1, 2, and 3 never access the high-affinity R-state active site. A consequence of the

10070 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 33, 2006 binding of these inhibitors to the T state is to cause the 80's loop to adapt an alternate conformation not observed with the natural substrates. When these inhibitors fill the T-state active site, they do prevent the quaternary conformational change to the R state. ActiVe Sites of the T1, T2, and T3 Structures Suggest a Mechanism for the Inhibition of Domain Closure. An inspection of active sites of the T1, T2, and T3 structures indicates that there are significant differences in how the phosphonacetamide moiety binds compared to how this moiety binds in the TPAM and RPM structures (39). In the T3 structure, these differences are most pronounced and include an omission of key interactions between 3 and the backbone carbonyls of Pro266 and Leu267 (Figure 3, T3-B), a new interaction between Arg296 and the phosphate oxygens of 3, and an interaction with Lys84 from an adjacent catalytic chain with the phenyl carboxylate of 3 (Figure 3, T3-B). Arg296 has not been observed to interact with substrates or substrate analogues; however, it has been observed to interact with PAM in the R236_PAM structure (40). Arg296 is held in position by hydrogen-bonding interactions with Thr55 and Ser58 of the 50's loop and Thr136, a residue on the cusp of the CP/Asp domains. Arg296 may function in a number of roles, including (i) an initial interaction with carbamoyl phosphate in the active site before the induced fit, (ii) stabilizing the position of the 50's loop, and (iii) helping correctly position CP for the nucleophilic attack by the R-amino group of aspartate (40). The role of Arg296 may be more important for the function of ATCase than previously thought because a sequence alignment of a number of transcarbamoylase genes indicated that this residue is conserved. The exact functional role of Arg296 must await direct verification by site-specific mutagenesis. In the T3 structure, Arg296 is coordinating one of the phosphate oxygens of 3 (Figure 3, T3-B) instead of the carbonyl oxygen of PAM as seen in the R236_PAM structure. This interaction may prevent the binding of the phosphoacetamide moiety of 3 in the proper orientation to induce the conformational changes that are observed when PAM binds (39). As observed in the TCP structure, critical for the preparation of the high affinity Asp binding site is the movement of the adjacent catalytic chain 80's loop toward the active site pocket to create the necessary electropositive environment for Asp binding (10). The novel conformation of the 80's loop seen in the T1, T2, and T3 structures does not create the necessary electropositive environment for Asp binding. These data indicate that inhibitors 1, 2, and 3 have the effect of keeping the architecture of the active site in the open conformation rather than promoting the induced fit observed with the natural substrates. This new class of ATCase inhibitors function by binding to the T-structure and inhibiting the enzyme by filling the T-structure active site. However, as opposed to the binding of CP or PALA, these inhibitors are unable to initiate the conformational change that reorients the active site residues for high-affinity binding. Furthermore, without the induced fit that normally occurs upon the binding of CP, the electrostatic environment of the active site is different than that observed with the natural substrates (or substrate analogues such as PALA). Although 2 and 3 are reasonably good inhibitors of ATCase, these data suggest how the structure of these molecules could be modified to produce even more

Heng et al. potent inhibitors. Using structural studies of these second generation inhibitors, it should be possible to develop even more potent inhibitors of ATCase.
