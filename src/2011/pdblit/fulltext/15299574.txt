Abstract

Cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) is an enzyme which produces cyclodextrins by the degradation of starch. The enzyme from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. 1011, consisting of 686 amino acid residues, was crystallized from the solution containing 20% PEG 3000 and 20% 2-propanol at pH 5.6 adjusted with citrate buffer. The space group was P! and the unit cell contained two molecules (V,,, = 2.41 A~ Da-l). The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method and refined to z. conventional R value of 0.161 (Rfrc~= 0.211) for the reflections in the resolution range 1.8-10]k by energy minimization combined with simulated annealing. The molecule consists of five domains, designated A-E, and its backbone structure is similar to the structure of other bacterial CGTases. The molecule has two calcium binding sites where calcium ions are coordinated by seven ligands, forming a distorted pentagonal bipyramid. The two independent molecules are related by a pseudotwofold symmetry and are superimposed with an r.m.s, deviation value of 0.32,~ for equivalent C '~ atoms. Comparison of these molecules indicated the relatively large mobility of domains C and E with respect to domain A. The active site is filled with water molecules forming a hydrogen-bond network with polar side-chain groups. Two water molecules commonly found in the active center of both molecules link to several catalytically important residues by hydrogen bonds and participate in maintaining a similar orientation of side chains in the two independent molecules.

1. Introduction

Cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (E.C. 2.4.1.19, abbreviated to CGTase) is an enzyme which degradates starch and produces cyclic oligosaccharides termed cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrins consist of six or more ~-l,4-1inked glucose units and form inclusion complexes with a variety of guest molecules because of the large annular cavity in the molecule (Szjitli, 1982). To form inclusion complexes, guest molecules should fit with the size of the cavity, even if only partially (Saenger, 1984; Harata, 1991). Since the formation of inclusion

complexes changes the chemical and physical properties of the guest molecules, cyclodextrins have been utilized in pharmaceutical, chemical and food industries. The CGTase from several bacterial sources produces a mixture of several types of cyclodextrins and noncyclic oligosaccharides with different characteristics of the product (Szjitli, 1988). Owing to the difference in the complex-forming ability among cyclodextrins, each individual cyclodextrin should be purified prior to utilization. Therefore, it is an ultimate goal to modify the enzyme for the production of only a specific cyclodextrin. We have been investigating the structure-function relationship of CGTase from an alkalophilic bacterium, which mainly produces 9-cyclodextrin consisting of seven glucose units. The enzyme consisting of 686 amino-acid residues is stable in a markedly wide pH range (5.5-11.0) at 310 K compared with CGTases from other bacterial sources. Our recent analysis of the disproponation reaction has suggested that the transglycosidation reaction proceeds by the 'ping-pong' mechanism (Nakamura, Haga & Yamane, 1994a). We have applied site-directed mutagenesis for amino-acid residues which have been considered responsible for the catalytic action and sugar binding. The replacement of aminoacid residues in the active site has produced mutant enzymes having different pH dependency and also different product composition (Nakamura, Haga & Yamane, 1993; Nakamura, Haga & Yamane, 1994b; Penninga et al., 1995). To discover the role of amino-acid residues in CGTase, which may reveal the catalytic action in alkaline conditions, the exact spacial position of the amino-acid residues in the three-dimensional enzyme structure is required. The crystal structures of CGTases from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Kubota, Matsuura, Sakai & Katsube, 1991), Thermoanaerobacterium thermosulfurigenes EM1 (Knegtel et al., 1996), Bacillus circulans strain 8 (Klein & Schultz, 1991) and strain 251 (Lawson et al., 1994) have been reported. All these are nonalkalophilic bacteria and the former are thermophilic. As reported in a previous paper (Haga, Harata, Nakamura & Yamane, 1994), our preliminary crystallographic study indicated that the unit cell contains two independent molecules.

2.1. Purification, mination

crystallization and calcium deter-

Preparation of CGTase from alkalophilic Bacillus. sp. 1011 was performed as described in the literature (Nakamura et at., 1992). Crystals were grown in 20%(w/v) PEG 3000 and 20% (v/v) 2-propanol solution with 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer at p H 5 . 6 (Haga et al., 1994). Rod-like crystals suitable for X-ray measurements were obtained by repeated macroseeding. The crystals belong to the space group P1 with unit-cell dimensions a = 64.93, b = 74.45, c = 79.12 ,~,, c~ = 85.2, /3 = 105.0 and F = 101.0 . The unit cell contains two molecules (V,,, = 2.41 A3 Da-I ). The calcium content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) with a Hitachi 18070 spectrometer and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) with a Jarrell Ash ICAP 757V spectrometer. The protein sample (20 mg) in 0.2 ml of Milli Q filtered water was digested with 2 ml of concentrated nitric acid (purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd as analytical grade) and dried on the electric hot plate. The resultant residual was dissolved in 1 ml of 1 N nitric acid. The solution was diluted to 10 ml and applied to the quantitative analysis. 2.2. Data collection X-ray diffraction data of CGTase crystals were collected to 2.0]k resolution on a Nonius FAST diffractometer equipped with a Varian image intensifier and an Elliott GX21 generator (40 kV, 70 mA, focal spot size 0.3 mm). For each crystal, data were collected at three goniometer settings. At the first setting, (rc,~p)= (0,0), data were collected in the 180 ° w-scan range. The second and third (~,~) settings were ( - 1 3 5 , 0 ) and (-135,90), respectively, with a 70 ° w-scan range. The data thus measured were merged to produce a set of unique reflections. Seven such data sets were obtained with an Rm~r~(l) value in the range 0.044-0.062. Further, two data sets with the resolution range 1.8-13.0 A were collected on a FAST diffractometer with a DEP image intensifier and a FR571 gencrator (40 kV, 45 mA, focal spot size 0.2 x 2 mm). The Rmerge(/) values for these data sets were 0.031 and 0.033. The merging of the nine data sets produced a final data set of 111 795 unique reflections (86.1% completeness) with the Rm~g~(1) value 0.080. Data statistics are given in Table 1.

2.3. Structure determination and refinement The structuie was solved by molecular replacement method using a set of coordinates of CGTase from B. stearothermophilus (Kubota et al., 1991); A self-rotation function calculated using 4 - 1 5 A resolution data indicated the presence of a local twofold axis. The cross-rotation search was made using Patterson vectors in the range 5-20 ~ and the 129 solutions obtained were subjected to the PC refinement (Brtinger, 1990), which gave a single plausible solution. The relative orientation of the second molecule was estimated from the result of the self-rotation search. To determine the relative position of the second molecule, the translation search was performed using the 4-15 ~ resolution data. The rigid-body refinement for the solution with the highest correlation gave an R value of 0.41 for the 4 - 1 0 , ~ data and the successive energy minimization was converged at an R value of 0.28 for the 3-10/~ resolution data. The structure was refined using the program X-PLOR (Brtinger, Kuriyan & Karplus, 1987). Before the replacement of amino-acid residves different from those of B. stearothermophilus CGTase, the molecular dynamics simulation was performed at 2000 (0.5 ps, step size 0.001 ps), 1000 (0.5ps, step size 0.001 ps) and 3 0 0 K (0.5 ps, step size 0.001 ps), followed by energy minimization (100 cycles for the coordinate and 30 cycles for the B factor) using the 2.5-5 ~ resolution data with IF,,I > 3or(F). The side-chain groups were replaced and their orientation was corrected on a 2F,, - F,+ map. Refinement using the 2.0-5 ~ resolution data included

X-RAY STRUCTURE OF CYCLODEXTRIN GLUCANOTRANSFERASE data. Each set of unique reflections was obtained from one crystal. Nine data sets in total were merged to produce the data set with 86%, completeness. For each data set, data collections were performed at three goniometer settings to estimate local scaling factors more accurately at the data merge stage, because of the low crystallographic symmetry. However, as shown in Table 1, the relatively large R,,~,,;~ value for the merge of nine data sets (8.0%) compared with the Rm~.,~. value of each data set (3.1-6.2%) indicates that the local scaling did not fully correct the intensity fluctuation resulting from absorption and/or deterioration of the crystal. 3.3. Structure determination and refinement The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using the coordinates of B. stearothermophillus CGTase, which has 63% sequence homology (Fig. 1) and refined to R=0.161 (Rtr~=0.211) for 101 409 reflections [F,, > 2 a ( F ) , 78% completeness] in the resolution range 1.8-10]~. In the course of refinement, the electron density strongly indicated the 452nd residue to be Pro in both the two independent molecules, although it was thought to be Arg in the sequence data. Therefore, the 452nd residues were refined as Pro, which was also found at the corresponding position in CGTases from B. stearothermophilus and B. circulans. The r.m.s, difference of bond distances and angles from their ideal values were 0.013/k and 2.6 °, respectively. The coordinate error estimated from the Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) shown in Fig~ 2 was ca 0.2 ~. The (~2, t/;) angles fall in the normal range in the Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) shown in Fig. 3, except those of Ala152 and Tyr195 ( ¢ " - 6 0 , ,~/)~ - 130 °). 3.4. M o l e c u l a r structure The molecule consists of five domains designated

dynamic simulation at 3000, 1000 and 500 K for 0.5 ps with step size 0.0005 ps at each temperature and energy minimization with 50 cycles for coordinates and B factors. Further dynamics simulation and energ~¢ minimization were twice performed with the 1.8-5 A resolution data. Water molecules were picked from F , , - F, and 2F,, - F, maps. Electron-density peaks which are higher than 3or in the F,, - F, map and are involved in suitable intermolecular contacts (2.5-3.3 ]k) with protein atoms were taken into account, but water molecules with B values higher than 6 0 A 2 were omitted during the refinement. The map calculation and structure refinement by molecular dynamics at 300K for l ps with step size 0.0005 ps and energy minimization (100 cycles for coordinates and 30 cycles for B values), followed by the examination of F,, - F,. and 3F,, - 2F,. maps, were twice repeated with the 1.8-10A resolution data. The refinement converged to an R value of 0.161 for 101 409 reflections with IF,,I > 2or(F). The final structure model included two protein molecules, four calcium ions and 805 water molecules with the full occupancy. The final F,, - F,. map showed no significant peaks that could be assigned for protein atoms or water positions. Atomic coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank.*

3. Results and discussion
3.1. The calcium ion

It is known that the calcium ion enhances the catalytic activity of CGTase. In the CGTase structures of B. circulans strain 8 (Klein & Schulz, 1991) and strain 251 (Lawson et al., 1994), two calcium binding sites have been defined. In the present study the calcium ion content was analytically determined by two spectroscopic methods, AAS and ICP-AES. The molar ratio of protein to calcium ions was 1:1.5 by AAS and 1:1.53 by ICP-, AES. The presence of the metal ions Na ÷, K ÷, M n ~+ Ni -'÷ and Zn 2+ was also examined, but they were not detectable in comparison with the control experiment. The X-ray result indicates that the CGTase molecule has two calcium binding sites, but they are not fully occupied. A certain amount of calcium might be lost during the purification, because it was carried out under the calcium-free condition. 3.2. Co,stallization and data collection CGTase was crystallized in the presence of 20% PEG 3000 and 20% 2-propanol as precipitants. Crystals did not grow in the absence of 2-propanol, but were stable even when 2-propanol was slowly evaporated. Nine crystals were used for the collection of diffraction

strain 8 (Klein & Schulz, 1991) and strain 251 (Lawson et al., 1994), as shown in Fig. 5 Domain A (residues 1-406) shows a typical (/4or) barrel 8 structure with an additional ~-helix (residues 285-292) and a long loop region containing a /4-sheet (residues 80--110). The domain B (residues 139-203), consisting of a short ~-helix, short strands and loops, is located at the wider side of the barrel, where the active site is situated. Only /3-sheet structures are observed in domains C (residues 407-496), D (residues 497-584) and E (residues 585-686). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two independent molecules. Molecule (2) is superimposed on molecule (1) by the least-squares method. The difference between equivalent C" atoms was plotted in Fig. 6. The r.m.s, difference is 0.32 for C" atoms. A marked

X-RAY STRUCTURE OF CYCLODEXTRIN GLUCANOTRANSFERASE D and E. Domain D has 14 amino-acid residues having polar contacts less than 3.3 ,~ with domain A (Table 2). On the other hand, 11 and ten amino-acid residues are found in domains C and E, respectively. Gerstein, Lesk & Chothia (1994) have classified the domain movements into two types, the hinge motion and the shear motion. In the present structure comparison of the two structures indicates a shear-like motion of domains C and E. At interfaces between these domains and domain A, many side-chain groups are interlocked and hydrogen bonds or salt bridges are mostly conserved in the two independent molecules, in spite of the movement of the backbone structure. The movement may be compensated at the interface by the accumulation of a small conformational change of side-chain groups. 3.5. lntermolecular molecules contacts between independent

difference is observed in the residue range 335-338, which is a loop region linking a short .I-strand (residues 320-322) and an st-helix (residues 339-350). The largest difference of 3.60/~ is observed at the Asn336 residue. Relatively large differences are also observed in the region of residues 140-200 (domain B), 440-500 (domain C) and 600-686 (domain E). The B values of the main chain are plotted against the residue number in Fig. 7. The average B value in molecule 1 is 18.4]k 2 for all atoms, 17.4A2 for main-chain atoms and 19.5 A2 for side-chain atoms. The corresponding values in molecule 2 are 22.2, 21.4 and 23.1]k 2. The difference of average B values between molecules 1 and 2 for each residue is plotted in Fig. 8. A relatively large difference is observed in the regions 440-490 (domain C) and 590-686 (domain E), which coincide with the regions of a relatively large positional difference. Comparison of two independent molecules indicates the relatively high mobility of domains C and E with respect to domain A. The r.m.s, deviations for C" atoms in each domain are 0.29 (domain A), 0.32 (domain B), 0.41 (domain C), 0.16 (domain D) and 0.39,~ (domain E). The relatively large r.m.s, deviation value of domain A is ascribed to the conformational difference in the residue region 335-338, as shown in Fig. 6. When these residues are excluded, the r.m.s, deviation value in domain A decreases to 0.17 ~, which is similar to the value of domain D. The larger deviation of domains C and E is ascribed to their hinge-like connection to other domains. A/C-sheet consisting of three strands in domain C faces (t-helices of domain A (Fig. 4). The two loops linking domain C to domains A and D form a hinge region. A fl-sheet in domain E is in contact with two (~-helices of domain A. On the other hand, domain D is situated between domains C and E. A/4-sheet in domain D has contacts with loops of domain A. The mobility of each domain is affected by the contacts with domain A, because there are no short contacts among domains C,

The two independent molecules are related by pseudotwofold symmetry, as shown in Fig. 9. The close contacts of the two molecules are observed in the regions 301-304 (domain A), 411-414 (domain C) and 562-564 (domain D), as shown in Fig. 10. The carboxyl groups of Glu411 in the two molecules are related by pseudotwofold symmetry and are in contacts with the dis:ance 2.6 A, suggesting a strong hydrogen bond. Side-chain groups of Tyr301 and Lys304 are hydrogen-bonded to the peptide O atoms of I1e414 and Glu411, respectively. The hydroxyphenyl group of Tyr301 faces the planar side-chain group of Trp413 of the other molecule in the hydrophobic interaction. In the residue region 562-564, a salt linkage is formed between Asp562 and Arg564, and five water-mediated hydrogen-bopd bridges are formed, as listed in Table 3.

KAZUAKI HARATA et al. The formation of the dimer-type structure has not been found in crystals of other CGTases, because aminoacid residues located at the dimer interface vary among four CGTases and only the present CGTase molecule has a sequence suitable for the formation of the dimer structure. The dimer interface does not involve the active-site region or sugar binding site located at domain E. 3.6. Geometry of the calcium binding sites The molecule contains two incompletely occupied calcium ions, as also determined by analytical methods. They are located in the loop regions of domain A and

stabilize the conformational structure of flexible regions (Fig. 4). Especially, the coordination bond with the backbone carbonyl O atoms is effective in hindering the main-chain movement. The calcium ion near the N terminal is surrounded by two backbone carbonyl O atoms, four side-chain O atoms and one water molecule (Fig. l la), and they form a distorted pentagonal bipyramid with OD1 (Asn33) and OD2(Asp53) located at the tops of the bipyramid (Table 4). A similar but more distorted pentagonal bipyramid, formed by three water molecules, O(Ile90), ODl(Asnl39) for the pentagon and ODl(Aspl99) and O(His233) for the two tops, is observed in the coordination geometry of the second

residues responsible for the catalytic action and are located at the bottom of a surface cavity in the A domain. Recently, Strokopytov et al. (1995) reported the structure of the acarbose complex with CGTase from B. circulans, where these residues are hydrogen bonded to acarbose. As shown in Fig. 12, the active-site cleft is filled with water molecules which form a hydrogen-bond network linking side-chain groups of polar amino-acid residues. The carboxyl group of Glu257, which has been suggested as a proton donor, is at a distance equivalent to a hydrogen bond or salt linkage with Arg227, His327 and Asp328, and also linked to Asp229 and Tyrl00 through water-mediated hydrogen-bond bridges (Fig. 13). Asp229 and Asp328 have been considered as essential residues for the catalytic action, because the replacement of these residues by Ala or Asn almost inactivated the enzyme (Klein & Schuitz, 1991; Nakamura et al., 1992). Furthermore, the enzyme activity was almost lost by the replacement of the His327 residue with Arg, while replacement with Asn drastically decreased the activity in the alkaline pH condition (Nakamura et al., 1993). Klein, Hollender, Bender & Shultz (1992) have suggested the importance of Asp328 in the vicinity of Glu257 to increase the pK,

X-RAY STRUCTURE OF CYCLODEXTRIN GLUCANOTRANSFERASE water molecule links the carboxyl groups of Glu257 and Asp229. These two water molecules are commonly found in the two independent molecules and seem to be important to maintain the side-chain orientation in the active site. In spite of the distinct difference in the pH dependency of the enzyme activity, the active-site structure is very similar between the present alkalophilic CGTase and nonalkalophilic CGTases.

value of Glu257 as a proton donor. The imidazolyl group of His327 is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the carboxyl group of Glu257. The combination of Glu257 with His327 may also play an important role in the relay system of enzyme action at high pH conditions. There are two water molecules which link the sidechain groups of these residues. One water molecule is surrounded by Arg227, Asp229, Giu257, His327, and Tyrl00 within hydrogen-bonding distance.
