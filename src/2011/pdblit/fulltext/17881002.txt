transfer reaction of amino acid from aminoacyl adenylate to tRNA catalyzed by aminocyl-tRNA synthetases from Escherichia coli (isoleucine and lysine) is actiby a variety of cations, exemplified by Me, spermine, and NH;. The phenylalanylsynthetase of E. coli has an absolute requirement for a divalent cation, Mgzt or and is not activated by amines. The arginine enzyme is fully active without added

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases carry out their overall reaction in the presence of a divalent cation, usually Me, required to produce the substrate form of ATP, its metal chelate (1). This requirement for metal ions complicates the problem of determining whether metal ions play an additional role in the formation of aminoacyl esters of tRNA. Previous studies have approached this problem by isolating complexes of enzyme with aminoacyl adenylate from mixtures of enzyme, ATP, and amino acid and using this complex as the source of amino acid for transfer as shown in Eq. [l]: enzyme. aminoacyl aminoacyl-tRNA adenylate + tRNA [l] + AMP + enzyme.

spermine (9), in contradiction to an earlier report (4) that concluded that the reaction rate was independent of added cations. We considered that a modified reaction system (2) with chemically synthesized aminoacyl adenylates as substrates could offer several advantages: linear rates, catalytic amounts of enzyme, and less difficulty in eliminating contaminating metals.

The results with various enzymes have been inconsistent, indicating that some of the synthetases have a requirement for divalent cations (2, 3) and others do not (4-7). The function of the cation has been delineated but not clarified by some reports that spermine can replace Me in the overall reaction (8). Our interest in this problem was stimulated by a report that the isoleucine enzyme is greatly stimulated by Mgz+ or

The results obtained with this system, described in this article, indicate that various synthetases do indeed have different requirements for activating ions, and also that the chemical nature of the active ions further restricts the interpretation of the results with regard to mechanism.

cellulose without prior charging of the tRNA with phenylalanine; it had phenylalanine acceptance of 0.39 nmol/Am. To remove tightly bound cations, all tRNAs were incubated with 150 mM EDTA at 55°C for 1 h, passed through a G-25 column at 55"C, and extensively dialyzed against glass-distilled water at 4°C.

Assays
OneraU charging reaction. The formation of aminoacyl-tRNA was measured according to Stern and Mehler (15). The reaction mixture (100 ~1) contained 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), 2 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCla 0.1 mM [`Clamino acid and 10 to 20 Am units of tRNA. Labeled aminoacyl-tRNA formed was precipitated with 10% trichloracetic acid. The suspension was filtered through a Whatman GA/F glass filter and washed with 20 ml of 2.5% trichloroacetic acid. Dried filter paper was counted in a Packard TriCarb liquid scintillation counter. The reaction was carried out for 10 min at 37'C unless otherwise noted. ATP:PPi exchange reaction. The reaction conditions are the same as the overall charging reaction except 1 mM unlabeled amino acid and 0.5 mM [=P]pyrophosphate replaced radioactive amino acid and tRNA.

Enzyme Preparations
Isoleucyl- and lysyl-tRNA synthetases were prepared as described previously (11) from E. coli B grown by Grain Processing Company, Muscatine, Iowa. Both purified enzymes were dialyzed against 150 mre EDTA overnight and redialyzed extensively against 50 mM Hepes' buffer prior to use. Phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase (PRS) was purified from cells of a mutant strain of E. coZi (strain IBPC 16'71pB1, a gift from Drs. M Springer and M. GrunbergManago). Cells were grown at 42°C in rich media supplemented with antibiotics and harvested at late log phase. The concentrations of antibiotics used were ampicillin, 25 pg/ml, and tetracycline, 10 fig/ ml. Purification steps include (a) extraction of soluble proteins with a French press followed by centrifugation, (b) DEAE-cellulose adsorption and elution with a gradient of pH 7.0 sodium phosphate buffer, from 50 to 400 mM. Phenylalanine enzyme was eluted between 0.2 and 0.24 M phosphate concentration. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated by precipitation with 70% saturated (NH&SO,. (c) The precipitate was dissolved in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), dialyzed extensively against the same buffer, and chromatographed on a hydroxyapatite column. The sample was eluted with a linear gradient of phosphate from 0.05 to 0.3 M. The active fractions were eluted around 0.13 M phosphate. At this stage, the enzyme was 95% pure, judging from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (d) An additional gel filtration step with Sephacryl-306 and elution with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, containing 60 mM KC1 resulted in homogeneous enzyme preparation. A typical preparation yields about `70 mg of enzyme from 100 g of wet cells. Aminoacylation of tRNA and ATPPPi exchange assays (12) were used routinely to follow the enzyme activities during the purification steps. Protein was measured by the method of Warburg and Christian (13). Chemical synthesis of aminoacyl adenylate was carried out by the method of Berg (14) with some modifications. For radioactive aminoacyl adenylate preparations, 40 pm01 of labeled amino acid, 200 pmol of AMP, and 1 g of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide were used in a volume of 1 ml pyridine. The yields vary from 10% for isoleucyl adenylate to * Abbreviations used: Hepes, 4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; SDS, sodium dodecyl sulfate.

Rate of Aminoacid Transfer from Amirumcyl Adenylate to tRNA
The reaction mixture (250 cl) containing 106 mM appropriate buffer, indicated amounts of cations, and 25 nmol of radioactive adenylate and enzyme at 0°C (otherwise noted). Four aliquots of 50 ~1 were taken out at appropriate times and added to 0.5 ml of chilled 10% trichloroacetic acid. The radioactive aminoacyltRNA formed was filtered, washed, and counted as in the overall charging reaction. RESULTS

The conditions used by Yarus and Rashbaum (4) for measuring the transfer of isoleucine from preformed enzyme-aminoacyl adenylate complex differed from those of Liivgren et al. (9). For measuring the partial reaction with exogenous isoleucyl adenylate and catalytic amounts of enzyme, we initially used Tris buffer as was used by Yarus and Rashbaum. Preliminary experiments showed that the addition of Me caused a small but reproducible increase in the rate of transfer. Subsequent explorations of conditions that might exaggerate or eliminate the effect of Mgz+ showed that the effect is not specific and that buffer ions can have similar effects. Therefore, buffers that do not appear to affect the catalytic properties of the enzyme were used for all further stud-

ies: sodium cacodylate, Hepes, and bicine to cover the range from pH 6 to 9. Indications that Tris buffer at higher concentrations stimulated the transfer reaction led us to test ammonium ions to see whether the primary amino group of Tris might be responsible for its effect. As shown in Fig. 1 the transfer reaction is stimulated to the same extent by appropriate concentrations of Me, spermine, or NH:. At lower pH values the rate of transfer is relatively slow but the stimulation is more pronounced. Again, the three cations selected show similar ability to stimulate the reaction.

Solutions of [3H]ile-AMP (specific activity 11,000 cpm/nmol) and 9 pg of isoleucyl enzyme were added to a mixture containing 100 mM appropriate buffer, an indicated amount of cation, and 25 Am units tRNAne. The reaction mixture (total volume, 250 al) was incubated at 0°C. Aliquots of 50 pl each were taken out at 30-, 60-, 90-, and 120-set points and added to 0.5 ml of chilled trichloroacetic acid. The acid precipitable counts were assayed as described in the text. (0, l ), Me; (0, W), spermine; (A, A), NH,Ac. Open symbols are for Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) and filled symbols are for cacodylate (pH 6.3). (B). Phenyl-tRNA synthetase. Same as (A) except Tris buffer (pH 8.0) and tRNAPhe replaced Hepes buffer and tRNA"`, respectively.

The effect of pH on the transfer reaction of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase is shown in Fig. 2A. The relatively greater degree of stimulation below pH 7 may indicate a transition in enzyme conformation at this pH or an effect of buffer ions. However, since the rate does not change with the concentration of Hepes between 0.05 and 0.15 M, buffer ions do not seem to be a factor. In earlier studies we have found stimulation by ions introduced as contaminants in the tRNA used. In the present experiments the activity in the presence of buffer alone is not likely to be a function of contaminants. In contrast to the low temperature dialysis used previously, such dialysis under denaturing conditions has been shown to remove cations effectively (16). Furthermore, previous studies of the effect of contaminating cations on the overall reaction showed that the rate was a function of tRNA concentration and that 0.01 M EDTA inhibited the reaction completely (17). In the transfer reaction, the rate in the absence of added cations is not altered by increasing the tRNA concentration or by the presence of EDTA. Therefore, it appears that there is an intrinsic activity that is independent of added activating ions. To determine whether activation by cations is a general property of aminoacyltRNA synthetases we examined the transfer reaction of other synthetases. The lysyl-tRNA synthetase of E. coli exhibits a much greater dependence upon added cations than the isoleucine enzyme (Fig. 2B). The specificity for the cations appears to be the same as for isoleucine. At all pH values there is no significant activity in the absence of added cations. That it is the cation that is responsible for the activation in the case of both enzymes is shown by substitution of various anions (Cl-, SOd2-, and acetate, which do not affect the activation by Me) but more clearly by the effect of EDTA; EDTA inhibits the stimulation by Mgz+ with which it forms a chelate complex, but not by spermine or NH:. All of the activators appear to act by the same mechanisms since the maximum activity is the same for single ions and combinations. (Table I).

KIMANDMEHLER It is clear that the activating ions do not alter the ionic strength to the same extent at the concentrations that stimulate maximally. The specificity of the activation confirms that ionic strength is not a major factor. KC1 and NaCl over a range of concentrations up to 0.5 M do not stimulate. The hypothesis that primary amines in general serve as activators was engendered by the observation that both Tris and NH: are effective but was made untenable by our finding that methylamine has no stimulatory effect, but instead inhibits. Although they show quantitative differences, the isoleucine and lysine enzymes respond qualitatively to the same activators. Other synthetases behave quite differently. The phenylalanine enzyme (Fig. lB, 2C) does have an absolute requirement for a divalent metal ion that can be satisfied only by Mp, MI?+, Ca2+, and Fe2+ of the ions tested. Inactive ions include Co2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Sm3+, Gd3+, and

Eu3+. In this case NH: gives a questionable small activation but spermine clearly does not activate the transfer reaction. Craine and Peterkofsky studied the kinetics of the overall reaction of the arginine enzyme in the presence of various divalent cations and concluded that these ions play a role in addition to forming a substrate by complexing with ATP (18). Our results show that the transfer reaction of this enzyme is totally indifferent to divalent cations and does not seem to require any exogenous activition. At all pH values the rate of transfer of arginine from arginyl adenylate to tRNA proceeds at the same rate in the presence or absence of EDTA and there is no stimulation by Mgz+ or spermine (Table II). If this enzyme does respond to a cation other than that chelated with ATP, it must do so in a step prior to transfer.
DISCUSSION

Study of the transfer reaction of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases with aminoacyl adenylates as substrates offers two major advantages over the previously used method of isolating the intermediary enzyme complex and measuring transfer from the complex to tRNA. One is that the enzyme is used catalytically and gives zero order reactions at rates that can be conveniently measured by selecting appropriate amounts of enzyme. Another, of

value in the present studies, is that the enzyme can be used in a state unprejudiced by its previous activity in forming aminoacyl adenylate from a metal chelate of ATP. Studies of only a few of the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that exist in all cells show the existence of at least three groups with respect to activation of the transfer reaction. (i) The first group, showing an absolute requirement for a divalent cation, is exemplified by the phenylalanine enzyme of E. co& Studies of the threonine enzyme from various organisms showed complete dependence of such cations (2,19) but it has not yet been determined whether the requirement for an activator can be satisfied by spermine or other ions. (ii) The second group includes several enzymes activated to varying extents by diverse ions, including divalent metals, spermine, and ammonium. This group includes the isoleucine and lysine enzymes of E. co& as shown in the present report, and the serine enzyme (8) and phenylalanine enzyme (3) from baker's yeast. (iii) A third group consists of enzymes that are fully active in the absence of activators. This includes the arginine enzyme of E. coli, discussed above, and the valine enzyme of yeast (7). In those cases in which cations activate, the interaction could be with either the enzyme or tRNA. Robinson and Zimmerman (20) carried out elaborate analyses of

the interaction of ions with phenylalanine-t,RNA from yeast and concluded that a conformational change in the tRNA brought about by Mgz+or polyamines was necessary for esterification by the amino acid. The early studies by Robinson and Zimmerman (3) on the yeast phenylalanine enzyme show that it is different in its responses to cations than the homologous enzyme from E. coli that we have studied. The yeast enzyme is activated by the polyamine whereas the E. co& enzyme is indifferent to spermine in its transfer reaction. The quantitative decrease in the extent of activation of the isoleucine enzyme with increasing pH suggests that the effect of the cations is on the protein in this case. If this is so, the similarity of responses of the lysine enzyme suggests that the enzymes of this group need some cations to establish the conformation needed for most efficient catalysis. Several investigators have studied interactions of cations with aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (l-9), but it is not yet possible to draw firm conclusions about the participation of dissoclable ions in catalysis or in maintaining conformation of the protein. It is conventional to think of divalent cations as devices that alter or stabilize conformations of macromolecules, proteins, and nucleic acids, by holding certain groups in relatively rigid chelate structures. This interpretation is often strengthened by the observation that organic polyamines, which bind very tightly to polyanions such as nucleic acids, serve in place of divalent cations. It is clear that in the cases described here this model is not correct. However, it is not apparent at this time how substances as diverse as Mgz+,spermine4+, and NH: can maintain an active conformation that is not maintained by K+ or several other ions.
