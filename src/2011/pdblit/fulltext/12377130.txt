Report

Summary The semaphorins are a large group of extracellular proteins involved in a variety of processes during development, including neuronal migration and axon guidance. Their distinctive feature is a conserved 500 amino acid semaphorin domain, a ligand-receptor interaction module also present in plexins and scatterfactor receptors. We report the crystal structure of a secreted 65 kDa form of Semaphorin-3A (Sema3A), containing the full semaphorin domain. Unexpectedly, the semaphorin fold is a variation of the propeller topology. Analysis of the Sema3A structure and structure-based mutagenesis data identify the neuropilin binding site and suggest a potential plexin interaction site. Based on the structure, we present a model for the initiation of semaphorin signaling and discuss potential similarities with the signaling mechanisms of other propeller cell surface receptors, such as integrins and the LDL receptor. Introduction The semaphorins are axon guidance signals that are defined by the presence of a conserved 500 amino acid semaphorin domain at their amino termini, which serves as a receptor recognition and binding module (reviewed in Fiore and Puschel, 2003). Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) ¨ was the first molecularly characterized chemorepellent and acts via a receptor complex that contains Neuropilin 1 (Nrp-1) as the ligand binding subunit and an A-Plexin as the signal-transducing subunit (Fiore and Puschel, ¨

2003) (Figure 1A). Nrp-1 and the closely related Nrp-2 appear to bind all class 3 semaphorins but differ in their affinity for individual members (Fiore and Puschel, 2003; ¨ He and Tessier-Lavigne, 1997; Kolodkin et al., 1997). Nrp-1 is an integral membrane protein with a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The neuropilin extracellular domain contains two CUB motifs (domain A: A1, A2), followed by two domains with similarity to coagulation factor V/VIII (domain B: B1, B2) and one MAM domain (domain C). Both domains A and B are essential for binding the semaphorin domain of Sema3A, while only B1 is required for the interaction with VEGF165 or the basic carboxy terminus of Sema3A (Giger et al., 1998; Gu et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2003; Nakamura et al., 1998; Renzi et al., 1999). While the C terminus does not contribute to the biological specificity of semaphorins, it is a major determinant of their affinity for neuropilins (Giger et al., 1998; Nakamura et al., 1998). Vertebrate A-Plexins are the signaling subunits for secreted class 3 semaphorins, while other plexins interact with semaphorins of different classes (Fiore and Puschel, 2003). In contrast to Sema3A, which is not ¨ able to bind directly to A-Plexins, Sema4D and Sema7A directly interact with Plexin-B1 and Plexin-C1, respectively (Takahashi et al., 1999; Tamagnone et al., 1999). Interestingly, all plexins contain an extracellular semaphorin domain that is strictly required for their function (Figure 1A). A semaphorin domain is also present in the scatter-factor receptor MET (Tamagnone et al., 1999). In order to gain an insight into the molecular mechanisms of semaphorin-mediated signaling, we have determined the structure of a functional 65 kDa Sema3A form (Sema3A-65K) containing the full semaphorin domain and propose a mechanism for initiation of Sema3Amediated signaling.

Results and Discussion Functional Characterization of Recombinant Sema3A-65K Sema3A-65K (residues 26­546; Figure 1A) was expressed as a soluble secreted protein in insect cells using the baculovirus system. Sema3A-65K specifically bound Nrp1-AB (containing domains A1, A2, B1, and B2) with submicromolar (230 nM) affinity while interacting only weakly with Nrp1-A (A1 A2) or Nrp1-B (B1 B2), as shown by tryptophane fluorescence titration spectroscopy (Figure 1B). Its biological activity was shown in a heterologous system that mimics growth cone collapse (Takahashi et al., 1999; Zanata et al., 2002). Sema3A-65K induced the collapse of transfected COS-7 cells that become responsive to Sema3A upon coexpression of Plexin-A1 and Nrp-1 with an EC50 of 1.9 M (Figures 1C and 1D). The difference in the biological activities of Sema3A-65K and of full-length Sema3A (EC50 of 0.1 nM) is partially due to the fact that semaphorin dimerization is required for eliciting full response

(D) The estimated EC50 for Sema3A-65K is 1.9 M. Cells were fixed, processed for indirect immunofluorescence using an anti-VSV antibody, and the number of collapsed cells determined. (E) Sema3A- 1 and Sema3A- 2 do not induce cytoskeletal collapse in the same assay. The concentration of recombinant semaphorin was 300 g/ml.

(Klostermann et al., 1998; Koppel and Raper, 1998). While full-length Sema3A (Sema3A-90K) is dimerized prior to receptor binding via a disulfide bridge, Sema3A65K is not a covalent dimer. In addition, the basic C-terminal semaphorin tail, while not directly contributing to receptor specificity, increases the affinity of the

molecule for its membrane bound receptors (He and Tessier-Lavigne, 1997; Feiner et al., 1997). Structure of Sema3A-65K The structure of Sema3A-65K was determined using two-wavelength MAD phasing (see the Supplemental

Data available online at http://www.neuron.org/cgi/ content/full/39/4/589/DC1) with data collected from a crystal produced with seleno-methionine-modified pro° tein. The final model is refined at 2.8 A resolution to an R factor of 24.9% (free R of 29.4%). Sema3A-65K (Figures 2A, 3A, and 3B) is an elongated disc-shaped mole° cule with approximate dimensions of 60 70 45 A. Unexpectedly, the semaphorin fold is a variation of the propeller topology (Paoli, 2001; Fulop and Jones, 1999), with seven blades radially arranged around a central axis. Each blade contains a four-stranded (strands A to D) antiparallel sheet. The inner strand of each blade (A) lines the channel at the center of the propeller, with strands B and C of the same repeat radiating outward, and strand D of the next repeat forming the outer edge of the blade (Figure 3). In contrast to most known propeller structures with approximately 40­45 residues per blade, the semaphorin blades average 70 amino acids (Figure 3E). The large size of the semaphorin domain is not due to a single inserted domain but results from the presence of additional secondary structure elements inserted in most of the blades. Specifically, semaphorin blade 1 contains an additional strand (1S1) and a helix (1H1), blade 2 has two inserted helices (2H1 and 2H2), blade 4 has an extra helix (4H1), and blade 5 has the largest insertion composed of three helices (5H1, 5H2, and 5H3) and two strands (5S5 and 5S6). Some of the loops connecting the secondary structure elements are also unusually long (see Figure 3B), including the four loops that form the proposed neuropilin binding site (Figures 2A and 4D). The individual propeller strands are in extended conformation, with radially directed hydrogen bonds. These mainchain hydrogen bonds are accessible at the surface of the propeller and could potentially mediate interactions with other proteins. The central tunnel is not cylindrical but is slightly conical in shape with the end defined by the N-terminal parts of the A strands (at the "top face" of the molecule) narrower than the C-terminal side (at the "bottom face"). Like most of the other known propeller structures, semaphorin uses a "loop and hook" system to close the circle between the first and the last blades (Paoli, 2001; Fulop and Jones, 1999). The Sema's loop and hook (Figure 3) are stronger than usually observed. Indeed, the N terminus of the molecule, in addition to contributing the fourth (D) antiparallel strand of the seventh blade (purple), wraps further around and contributes a fifth, this time parallel, strand to the sixth blade (blue). Four disulfide bonds also stabilize the structure: Cys 103 ­ Cys 114, Cys 132 ­ Cys 144, Cys 269 ­ Cys 381, and Cys 293 ­ Cys 341. Two of these are within the second blade and two connect the fourth and the fifth blades. The fourth and fifth blades contain more elaborate structural features, including long protruding loops that form the proposed neuropilin interaction site (see Discussion further below). Semaphorin is a glycosylated protein, and N-linked N-acetyl- -D-glucosamine moieties, modifying Asn-53 and Asn-125, were clearly identifiable in the electron density map and were built into the model. On the basis of sequence homology, the semaphorin residues 515­568 are predicted to fold into a so-called PSI domain (Bork et al., 1999) (Figure 1A). Part of this sequence is present in Sema3A-65K (the furin pro-

cessing site is at position 546) and is partially ordered, but the electron density in the region is weak, and it cannot be built into the semaphorin model. PSI domains are present in other extracellular proteins, but their structures are not known. In integrin 3, the structure of which was recently reported (Xiong et al., 2001), the PSI domain was also not well ordered in the crystals. Structural Homology to Other Proteins A comparison of the Sema3A structure with the contents of the FSSP database (Holm and Sander, 1998) reveals structural similarity with other propeller-containing proteins. The closest structural homologs of Sema3A are the subunit of the trimeric G protein transducin (Sondek et al., 1996), the transcriptional repressor tup1 (Sprague et al., 2000), Arp3 (Robinson, et al., 2001), and integrin V (Xiong et al., 2001). The seven-bladed propeller domains of these proteins can be superimposed on the corresponding regions of Sema3A with rootmean-square deviations (rms) between carbon posi° tions of 3.3 A for transducin (for a selected 282 atoms), ° ° 3.3 A for tup1 (287 atoms), 3.7 A for Arp3 (282 atoms), ° and 4.1 A for integrin (302 atoms). The semaphorin propeller structure is bigger than its structural homologs (Figure 3A), and only the regions containing the four innermost strands (A, B, C, and D) of the semaphorin blades can be superimposed, since only they have direct structural counterparts. Semaphorins, plexins, and scatter-factor receptors were not recognized until now as propeller proteins, because they lack any detectable repeating motifs in their sequences. Even in light of the Sema3A structure, a superposition of the seven semaphorin blades fails to reveal any consensus sequence repeat (Figure 3E). In contrast, most other propellers are stabilized by different sets of interactions that result in sequence repeats (or motifs) shared by all or most individual modules. For example, in the WD repeats of G , the residues TrpSer/Thr-His-Asp form an electrostatic tetrad reoccurring throughout the circular array. Other such motifs include the YWTD, TolB, RCC1, and Tachylectin-2 repeats, the aspartate box, and the (WD), kelch and tryptophandocking motifs (Fulop and Jones, 1999). Instead of repeating sequence or structural motifs, the semaphorin fold is partially stabilized by the conserved disulfide bonds, which contribute to maintaining the protein architecture while allowing divergence in the sequence. In this respect, semaphorin is similar to viral neuraminidase, the six-bladed propeller of which has 9 disulfide bonds and very little interrepeat sequence similarity (Varghese et al., 1983; Paoli, 2001). Sema3A-65K Dimerization and Stoichiometry of the Sema3A-65K/Nrp-1AB Complex Sema3A-65K migrates as a dimer during gel filtration and is a dimer in the crystals (Figure 2A). The two monomers in the asymmetric unit are structurally very similar ° (rmsd for equivalent C positions is 0.45 A), except for the crystallographic packing at two flexible surface loops. The monomers bind each other using four protruding surface loops, 4S3-4S4 (B4-C4), 5S1-5S2 (D4A5), 5S3-5S4 (B5-C5), and 5S5-5S6 (C5-D5), which intertwine with each other to form an intimate and extensive ° ° interface burying a total of 2900 A2 (1450 A2 in each

monomer). The interface contains both hydrophobic ( 40% of the total) and polar residues, and the molecular interactions between them include hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and Van der Waals contacts. We further investigated the oligomeric states of the protein and of its receptor Nrp-1AB in solution, as well as the stoichiometry of their interaction using analytical ultracentrifugation. The experiments summarized in Figures 2B­2D document that Sema3A-65K is a dimer in solution (the estimated Kd of dimerization is 3 M; data not shown) and undergoes a dimer-to-monomer transition upon binding to monomeric Nrp-1AB (Kd of 0.23 M; Figure 1B), thus forming a 1:1 complex. The neuropilin complex formed by Sema3A-90K (or "full-length" Sema3A), which is the predominant Sema3A form in vivo (Adams et al., 1997), is expected to have a 2:2 stoichiometry, since Sema3A-90K is a preformed covalent dimer via a disulfide bridge located outside of the receptor binding domain (see Figure 5A). The Neuropilin Binding Site The fact that neuropilin binding competes with semaphorin dimer formation indicates that the neuropilin binding region of Sema3A overlaps with or is very close to the dimerization interface. Our data further suggests that the neuropilin binding surface of the semaphorins is likely localized to the upper part of the top face of the propeller, centered around the protruding flexible loops of blades 4 and 5 (blue and green on Figure 3A). Since all class 3 semaphorins bind neuropilins, while class 4 semaphorins do not (Fiore and Puschel, 2003), ¨ a structure-based analysis of the conservation of semaphorin residues should yield insight into the location of important ligand/receptor interfaces. Figure 4A shows in cyan all surface-exposed residues, which are conserved only within class 3 molecules but not between the 3 and 4 classes (see also the Supplemental Data at http:// www.neuron.org/cgi/content/full/39/4/589/DC1). The only substantial continuous surface patch with this conservation profile (blue circle in Figure 4A) overlaps with the Sema3A-65K dimerization interface (Figure 4C). Furthermore, analysis of the electrostatic potential on the molecular surface of Sema3A reveals that the top face of the molecule (Figure 4B, left) is positively charged, particularly around blades 3 and 4, while the bottom face contains many acidic surface-exposed residues (Figure 4B, right). Neuropilin-1 is negatively charged with a pI value of 5.5 for both the whole extracellular and the Nrp-1AB regions and is thus likely to interact with the basic Sema3A region. To understand better the role of the surface loops that mediate Sema3A-65K dimerization (magenta on Figure 4C), in Nrp-1 binding, we engineered two Sema3A-65K

variants, containing a deletion of the 4S3-4S4 (B4-C4) loop (Sema3A- 1: deletion of residues 252­260, green in Figure 4D) or the 5S5-5S6 (C5-D5) loop (Sema3A- 2: residues 359­366, orange in Figure 4D). Sema3A- 1 and Sema3A- 2 are properly folded, as judged by CD spectroscopy (data not shown), but are monomeric even at millimolar concentrations both during gel filtration chromatography and in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (Figure 2E). Importantly, both Sema3A mutants do not bind Nrp-1 (Figure 1B) and do not promote cytoskeletal collapse (Figure 1E). These results confirm that the high-affinity semaphorin-neuropilin interface indeed falls within the area circled on Figure 4A. Interestingly, a Sema3A-neutralizing antibody was previously shown to target specifically the loop deleted in Sema3A2 (Shirvan et al., 2002). Peptides corresponding to Sema3A residues 363­380 (5S5-5H2/C5-D5, Figure 3E) mimick the biological activity of full-length Sema3A (Shirvan et al., 2002). Finally, the closest structural homologs of Sema3A, namely, the transducin subunit and integrin, utilize corresponding surfaces on their propellers to bind their respective interaction partners (Xiong et al., 2001; Sondek et al., 1996). Specifically, the interaction interfaces are located on the top face of the propeller, slightly off-center, with most interface residues belonging to blades 2 through 5. Potential Plexin Interaction Site The Nrp-1/Plexin-A1 complex significantly differs in its binding properties for Sema3A from Nrp-1, suggesting that it presents a more extensive interaction surface containing a plexin component (Rohm et al., 2000; Takahashi et al., 1999). Many semaphorins from other classes (e.g., class 1, 2, 4, 7) directly bind plexins (Fiore and Puschel, 2003). A 70 amino acid region within the sema¨ phorin domain (indicated with red in Figure 4E) harbors the signaling specificities of the molecules (Koppel et al., 1997). Since both Sema3A and Sema3D bind neuropilin-1 with high and comparable affinities (Feiner et al., 1997), the different biological activities of the two molecules are likely due to their utilization of different signaling coreceptors. The Sema3A-65K structure reveals that residues 166­ 235 constitute the third propeller blade. Interestingly, the largest semaphorin/semaphorin crystal-packing interface (dimerization is not considered crystal packing) ° maps to the same location, burying approximately 500 A2 of the side of the propeller at blade 3 (Figure 4F). The total buried area in the two interacting molecules is ° approximately 1000 A2, which, although much smaller than the area buried in the semaphorin dimerization interface, is still significant, suggesting that the observed crystal-packing interface might represent a biologically

The names of the Sema3A-65K secondary structure elements are listed below the secondary structure symbols. Alternative names corresponding to standard labeling practices for propeller strands are given above the secondary structure symbols of strands which have structural counterparts in the other known seven-bladed propeller structures.

relevant protein-protein interaction. Since the Sema3A/ PlexinA1 interaction most probably involves a direct but weak binding between the semaphorin domains of the

proteins, the semaphorin/semaphorin crystal-packing interface might mimic the ligand/coreceptor interface formed during signaling initiation.

The latter is also the target of a semaphorin3Aneutralizing antibody, and peptides derived from this region (residues 363 380) induce Sema3A-specific biological responces (Shirvan et al., 2002). (E) Residues suggested to determine coreceptor preferences are shown in red.

Plexin Autoinhibition The presence and the specific localization of the ligand binding propeller domains in plexins and the LDL re-

ceptor (LDLR) suggests that they might share a similar autoinhibition mechanism (Figure 5B) (Rudenko et al., 2002; Takahashi and Strittmatter, 2001). In both cases,

Figure 5. Model for Semaphorin Signaling (A) Initiation of Sema3A-mediated signaling via the Nrp-1/Plexin-A1 complex (see discussion in text). Sema3A is in magenta (Sema domain, heptagon; PSI domain, circle; Ig domain, oval). In plexin, the Sema domain is in dark blue, the IPT domains in green, and the PSI regions in light blue. The intracellular SexPlexin domain is in brown, and the star corresponds to the activated form (the red arrow indicates signaling directing growth cone collapse). In Nrp-1, the A1 and A2 domains are in red, B1 and B2 are in orange, and the MAM domain is in yellow. Sema3A binding results in a 2:2:2 ligand/receptor/coreceptor complex formation and the release of the plexin membrane-proximal extracellular region, which in the absence of constrains adopts an active conformation (right panel). (B) (Left panel) Initiation of Sema4D signaling via the Plexin-B1 receptor. In this case, no coreceptors are required. As with Sema3A, ligand binding disrupts the inhibitory semaphorin conformation, resulting in activation of downstream signaling. (Middle panel) The LDL receptor and plexins share a structurally similar autoinhibition mechanism. In both cases, the propeller domains (heptagons) function as an alternate substrate and bind in cis other domains of the receptors, thus inhibiting the molecules. The inhibition of the LDLR is relieved at high pH, allowing the propeller domain to be displaced by LDL. (Right panel) Integrin activation. The subunit is in blue, and the is in red. The large conformational change in plexins that accompanies the release of autoinhibition is reminiscent of the rearrangement of integrin ectodomains during activation. Interestingly, integrins have also been shown to undergo an intracellular domain separation (brown arrow) concomitant with receptor activation (Kim et al., 2003). In addition, plexins and integrins may share inside-out signaling.

the propeller domain functions as an alternate substrate and binds in cis other receptor domains (the LA4/ R4 and LA5/R5 cysteine-rich modules in LDLR and the IPT domains of plexins), thus inhibiting the molecules. The inhibition of the LDLR is relieved at high pH, allowing the propeller domain to be displaced by LDL. In plexins, on the other hand, interactions with the semaphorin domain of their ligands presumably dissociates the inhibitory complex, resulting in activation of downstream signaling. Interestingly, the LA4/LA5 binding site on the LDL propeller domain is centered on blades 4 and 5 at the "top" face of the molecule, occupying the same general location as the proposed neuropilin-interaction site on the Sema3A semaphorin domain. A Model for Initiation of Semaphorin Signaling Our results, in conjunction with previously published data (Giger et al., 1998; Gu et al., 2002; Nakamura et al., 1998; Renzi et al., 1999; Takahashi and Strittmatter, 2001; Tamagnone et al., 1999), suggest that the following molecular events occur during the initiation of sema-

phorin signaling (Figure 5). In the absence of ligand, plexins assume an autoinhibited state where their N-terminal semaphorin domain intramolecularly interacts with the C-terminal part (IPT sequences) of the ectodomain, constraining the juxtamembrane and intercellular domains in an inactive conformation. Nrp-1 interacts with both the semaphorin domain and the IPT region of Plexin-A1 (Takahashi and Strittmatter, 2001) and thus stabilizes the autoinhibited conformation of the molecule. Binding of Sema3A to Nrp-1 leads to a conformational change in Plexin-A1 that is transmitted to the cytosolic domain. We suggest that Sema3A contains two distinct interaction surfaces. One is more extensive, overlaps with the Sema3A-65K dimerization interface (Figure 5A, site 1), and is responsible for the initial highaffinity binding to the AB domain of Nrp-1. The second site (Figure 5A, site 2) is smaller and located at the side of the propeller. The binding of Sema3A to Nrp-1 presents site 2 for binding to the Plexin-A1 semaphorin domain. The ensuing Sema3A/plexinA1 interaction displaces the bound IPT region and releases the plexin

juxtamembrane and intercellular domains from their inactive conformation, initiating downstream signaling. In the activated receptor, Nrp-1 remains associated with Plexin-A1 through a direct interaction with its semaphorin domain. The interaction with the C-terminal half of the Plexin-A1 ectodomain may also be preserved (Takahashi and Strittmatter, 2001). The two coreceptors interact also indirectly, through the bound Sema3A ligand. Some plexins, such as Plexin-B1 are directly activated by semaphorins (Tamagnone et al., 1999). In this case, the interaction between the semaphorin domains of the ligand and receptor is of high affinity, and the binding does not require assistance from a neuropilin (Figure 5B, left panel). Finally, the large conformational change in plexins that likely accompanies the release of autoinhibition is reminiscent of the rearrangement of integrin ectodomains after their activation (Figure 5B, right panel). Interestingly, the interaction of Rac with the cytoplasmic domain of Plexin-B1 leads to an increase in its affinity for Sema4D and its transport to the plasma membrane (Vikis et al., 2002), suggesting a similar mechanism of inside-out signaling that is used by integrins (Hynes, 2002; Takagi et al., 2002). Furthermore, plexins and integrins may both utilize a novel activation mechanism (Figure 5) where their intracellular signaling domains are held in close proximity to each other in the inactive state and undergo significant spatial separation upon receptor activation (Kim et al., 2003; Takahashi and Strittmatter, 2001).
Experimental Procedures Protein Expression and Purification Mouse Sema3A-65K (residues 26­546) was cloned in the pAcGP67B baculovirus vector with a 6xHis-tag at the N terminus. Mouse Nrp1AB (residues 27­583), Nrp-1A (residues 27­265), and Nrp-1B (residues 274­583) were cloned in the pVL-VSV baculovirus vector with a 6xHis-tag at the N terminus. The recombinant baculovirus vectors were cotransfected with BaculoGold DNA (PharMingen) in SF9 cells. Passage 4 was used to infect Hi5 cells in suspension at a density of 1.8 106 cells/ml in EX-CELL-405 serum-free media (JRH Biosciences). Infected cells were grown at 27 C and 110 rpm and harvested after 64 hr. For the production of Selenomethionine (SeMet) Sema3A, 22 hr after the infection the cells were spun down and the media was changed to EX-CELL-405 Modified (methionine deficient). The cells were grown for additional 3.5 hr ("starvation" period) to lower the intracellular pool of methionine, spun down, and the media was changed to methionine deficient supplemented with 120 mg/l SeMet. The cells were harvested 64 hr after infection. The proteins were purified using cobalt-chelating and gel-filtration chromatography. Mutagenesis Sema3A receptor binding mutants (Sema3A- 1 lacks residues 252­ 260 and has Ala 251 substituted with a glycine; Sema3A- 2 lacks residues 359­366 and has His 358 and Val 367 substituted with glycines; the glycines were introduced to allow mainchain flexibility) were generated using QuickChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing. Sema3A- 1 and Sema3A- 2 were indistinguishable from Sema3A-65K as judged by CD spectroscopy and behaved in identical fashion during purification, with the exception of being monomeric rather than dimeric on gel filtration (data not shown). Fluorescence Titration Measurements were done on a FluoroMax-2 spectrofluorimeter (SPEX) in a time drive mode using 10 mm pathlength fluorescence

cuvettes. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 and 350 nm (respectively), and slit widths were 5 nm. The temperature was kept at a constant 25 C. Titrations were done by adding small volumes of concentrated (0.5 mM) Sema3A-65K (or Sema3A- 1 or Sema3A- 2) solution to a cuvette containing 2 ml of a 0.5 M solution of Nrp-1A, Nrp-1B, or Nrp-1AB in 10 HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) and allowing the mixture to equilibrate for 5 min. The volume of added Sema3A never exceeded 5% of the total volume. A difference between the fluorescence units ( F.U.) of the complex in comparison to the theoretical value, calculated from the individual fluorescence units of Nrp-1 and Sema3A (with "KaleidaGraph" software), was used to calculate the binding affinity. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Measurements were performed on a Beckman XL-A centrifuge equipped with an An-60 Ti rotor. Protein solutions were loaded at initial concentrations of 30, 3, and 1 M in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.4 M KCl, and analyzed at rotor speeds of 8 and 11 krpm for Sema3A-65K and Sema3A-65K/Nrp-1AB, and 13 and 16 krpm for Nrp-1AB, Sema3A- 1, and Sema3A- 2 at 20 C. Data were acquired at two wavelengths per rotor speed and processed simultaneously with a nonlinear least squares fitting routine. Collapse Assay The COS-7 collapse assay was done as described previously (Zanata et al., 2002) and the number of collapsed cells determined (n 3 coverslips per value; approximately 300 to 500 cells were counted per coverslip). Crystallization and Structure Determination Purified Sema3A-65K was concentrated to 15 mg/ml and crystallized in a hanging drop at 20 C against a reservoir containing 100 mM Tris Hydrochloride (pH 8.5), 30 mM Heptyl- -D-thioglucoside, and 8% Polyethylene Glycol 8,000. The space group is C2 with a ° ° ° 219.38 A, b 59.83 A, c 122.91 A, 109.0, and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data were collected at beamlines NE-CAT (APS) and F2 (CHESS). All data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The locations of the Se atoms were identified with the program SnB (Miller et al., 1993). The peaks were refined using MLPHARE (CCP4, 1994). Model building proceeded through an iterative process of building in O and refinement of the model in CNS (Jones et al., 1991; Brunger et al., 1998). ¨ Acknowledgments This work was upported by the New York State Spinal Cord Injury Research Program (D.B.N) and by DFG and Fonds der Chemischen Industrie (A.W.P.).
