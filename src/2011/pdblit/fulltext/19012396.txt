Abstract: There has been considerable interest in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) as a therapeutic target for diabetes, obesity, as well as cancer. Identifying inhibitory compounds with good bioavailability is a major challenge of drug discovery programs targeted toward PTPs. Most current PTP active site-directed pharmacophores are negatively charged pTyr mimetics which cannot readily enter the cell. This lack of cell permeability limits the utility of such compounds in signaling studies and further therapeutic development. We identify aryl diketoacids as novel pTyr surrogates and show that neutral amide-linked aryl diketoacid dimers also exhibit excellent PTP inhibitory activity. Kinetic studies establish that these aryl diketoacid derivatives act as noncompetitive inhibitors of PTP1B. Crystal structures of ligand-bound PTP1B reveal that both the aryl diketoacid and its dimeric derivative bind PTP1B at the active site, albeit with distinct modes of interaction, in the catalytically inactive, WPD loop open conformation. Furthermore, dimeric aryl diketoacids are cell permeable and enhance insulin signaling in hepatoma cells, suggesting that targeting the inactive conformation may provide a unique opportunity for creating active site-directed PTP1B inhibitors with improved pharmacological properties.

Introduction

Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) constitute a large family of enzymes, which are crucial modulators of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent cellular events.1 Malfunction in PTP activity is associated with many human diseases, including cancer, diabetes/obesity, and autoimmune disorders.2 Among members of the PTP superfamily, PTP1B is considered one of the bestvalidated targets for therapeutic development. Biochemical and genetic evidence indicate that PTP1B plays a key role in regulating body weight, glucose homeostasis, and energy expenditure by acting as a key negative regulator of insulin and leptin receptor mediated signaling pathways. PTP1B-deficient mice display increased insulin sensitivity and improved glycemic control, and are resistant to diet-induced obesity.3,4 Moreover, studies with PTP1B antisense oligonucleotides in diabetes

animal models demonstrate that a reduction in PTP1B leads to decreases in adipose tissue mass, plasma insulin, and blood glucose levels.5 These findings suggest that inhibition of PTP1B represents an effective strategy to combat metabolic syndromes such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Besides having a role in dampening insulin- and leptinmediated processes, PTP1B also augments signaling downstream of growth factor receptors and integrins. To that end, PTP1B can remove the inhibitory phosphate from the C-terminus of Src, thereby promoting Src kinase activation.6-8 In addition, PTP1B dephosphorylates the scaffolding adapter protein p62DOK, leading to activation of the Ras-ERK pathway.9 Given that PTP1B is capable of promoting both the Src kinase and Ras/ Erk pathways, which are major components in HER2/Neu signaling, PTP1B may function as an oncogene in the context of breast cancer. Interestingly, PTP1B is up-regulated in HER2/

Neu-transformed cells10 and 90% of all breast tumors overexpress both HER2/Neu and PTP1B.11 More recent studies reveal that crossbreeding transgenic mice expressing activated HER2/ Neu with PTP1B-/- mice caused delayed HER2/Neu-induced mammary tumor development and reduced the incidence of lung metastases.12,13 These data suggest that PTP1B-specific inhibitors may qualify as an effective treatment for breast cancer. Given the compelling evidence linking PTP1B to multiple human diseases, major efforts have been initiated by both the pharmaceutical industry and academia to target PTP1B for therapeutic development. Contrary to the widely held belief that PTPs are challenging targets for small-molecule inhibitor development, numerous potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors have been described.14 However, most of the reported compounds contain negatively charged nonhydrolyzable phosphotyrosine (pTyr) mimetics, due primarily to the highly positively charged nature of the active site evolved to bind pTyr. Consequently, poor membrane permeability has limited further advancement of such compounds as drug candidates. Thus, one challenge which has previously delayed realization of PTP1Bbased small-molecule therapeutics has been the identification of novel chemical entities with improved physicochemical properties and bioavailability. We report the characterization of aryl diketoacids as novel pTyr surrogates for PTP inhibitor development. Surprisingly, we discovered that amide-linked aryl diketoacid dimers, which lack any formal charge, also exhibit PTP inhibitory activity. X-ray crystallographic analyses of ligand-bound PTP1B structures revealed that although monomeric and dimeric aryl diketoacid occupy and interact with the enzyme active site in distinct manner, both compounds stabilize PTP1B in its inactive, WPD loop open conformation. Importantly, dimeric aryl diketoacids are cell permeable and enhance insulin signaling in hepatoma cells. These properties suggest that it is possible to develop uncharged PTP1B active site-directed inhibitors with improved in ViVo efficacy, thereby facilitating the development of PTP1B-based therapeutics for the treatment of diabetes, obesity, and breast cancer. Furthermore, targeting the inactive conformation may constitute a general strategy for PTP inhibitor design.

PTP1B. The catalytic domain of PTP1B (residues 1-321) and its mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described previously.19 All mutant forms of PTP1B were generated using the QuickChange kit from Stratagene. Kinetic Analysis of PTP1B Inhibition by Aryl Diketoacids and Their Dimers. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 10 mM. The effect of each compound on the PTP1B-catalyzed pNPP hydrolysis was determined at 25 °C and pH 7.0 in a 200 µL reaction system in a 96-well plate. Each reaction contained 10 µL of 2 mM compound in DMSO (final concentration 100 µM) and 190 µL assay buffer (50 mM 3,3-dimethylglutarate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.0 with an ionic strength of 0.15 M adjusted by addition of NaCl) containing 2 mM pNPP and 10 nM PTP1B. The PTP-catalyzed reaction was started by addition of the PTP1B. Ten µL of DMSO (i.e., no aryl diketoacid) was used as a control. The PTP1B-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 405 nm of the product p-nitrophenol continuously, with a SpectraMAX Plus 384 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The initial rate was obtained by calculating the slope of the product versus the time curve. The IC50 value was determined by plotting relative PTP activity toward pNPP activity versus inhibitor concentration and fitting to eq 1 using SigmaPlot 10.0.

The PTP1B-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP in the presence of aryl diketoacid was assayed at 25 °C and in the assay buffer described above. The reaction was initiated by addition of PTP1B to a reaction mixture (200 µL) containing various concentrations of pNPP (ranging from 0.2 to 5 Km) and various fixed concentrations of aryl diketoacid, and quenched by addition of 50 µL of 5 M NaOH.

All crystallization experiments were carried out at 4 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion methods. For cocrystallization, 20 µL of PTP1B stock (7.0 mg/mL) in 100 mM MES (pH 6.5), 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 3.0 mM DTT was mixed with 1 µL of LZP6 or LZP25 stock solutions (20 mM in DMSO). Crystals of PTP1B · LZP25 and PTP1B · LZP6 were obtained at 4 °C by vapor diffusion in hanging drops. The protein drops were equilibrated against a reservoir solution containing 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mM magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, and 100 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.7). The crystals of PTP1B · LZP6 and PTP1B · LZP25 both belonged to space group P3121 (Table 3). For X-ray data collection, the crystals were transferred into 5 µL of cryoprotectant buffer containing 30% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mM NaCl, and 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.7), and were allowed to soak for 30 min. The crystals were then flash-cooled by liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected at 100 K on a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode generator (Rigaku/MSC) equipped with focusing mirrors (MSC/Yale) and an R-AXIS IV++ image plate detector. Data were processed using the program HKL2000,20 and the statistics are provided in Table 3. Structural Determination and Refinement. The structure of PTP1B · LZP25 was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe.21 The structure of PTP1B (PDB entry code 1PXH),22 without the solvent molecules and the bidentate inhibitor, was used as a search model. The resulting difference Fourier map indicated some alternative tracing, which was incorporated into the model. The map revealed the density for the bound LZP25 in the active site of PTP1B. The structure was refined to 2.4 Å resolution with the program CNS,23 first using simulated annealing at 3,000 K, and then alternating positional and individual temperature factor refinement cycles.

They were assigned in the |Fo| - |Fc| difference Fourier maps with a 3 cutoff level for inclusion in the model. The structure of PTP1B · LZP6 was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of PTP1B · LZP25 as the search model (except that LZP25 and solvent molecules were omitted). The map revealed very good density for the bound LZP6 in the active site of PTP1B. The structure was refined at 1.9 Å with the program CNS (Table 3), following a protocol similar to that described above. Cell Lines and Tissue Culture. Human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were obtained from ATCC (HB-8065). HepG2 cells were grown and maintained in Minimum essential Medium (MEM, Eagle) with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 environment. Immunoblotting. Sixty to eighty percent confluent HepG2 cells were starved for 5 h in MEM without serum. Next, cells were treated for 20 min with a range of concentrations of LZP25 or LZP6, followed by stimulation with or without 100 nM insulin for 5 min. Incubation was terminated by removing the fluid and cells were washed with cold PBS. Cells were scraped and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM orthovanadate, 5 mM iodoacetic acid, 5 mg/mL leupeptin, 5 mg/ mL aprotinin, 0.1 mg/mL PMSF, and 1 mM benzamidine). After 30 min lysing on ice, the cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 15 min. Total cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was immunoblotted by antiphospho-IR antibodies. To confirm the equal sample loading, the membrane was also probed with anti- -Actin antibody. Blots were developed using a Western blot detection kit (upstate) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blotting images were analyzed with Image J (NIH). Results and Discussion Aryl Diketoacid Derivatives as PTP1B Inhibitors. One of the most efficient methods for the acquisition of active site-directed, reversible, potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors is to tether a nonhydrolyzable pTyr mimetic to an appropriately functionalized chemical moiety, which makes it possible to target both the active site and a unique nearby subpocket.14 Although numerous pTyr surrogates have been reported,26 they are generally not drug-like, and usually have limited cell membrane permeability. Thus, there is continued interest in developing novel pTyr mimetics with more acceptable pharmacological properties.27 The aryl diketoacid scaffold has been used successfully for the design of HIV-1 integrase inhibitors.28 Given the structural similarity between aryl diketoacids and pTyr, we were intrigued to find out whether aryl diketoacids possess any inhibitory activity against PTP1B. A number of aryl diketoacid derivatives were synthesized (Figure 1, and Materials and Methods). The ability of these compounds to inhibit PTP1Bcatalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was

assessed at pH 7 and 25 °C (for details see Materials and Methods). As shown in Table 1, simple aryl diketoacids (LZP36, LZP3, and LZP39) exhibit no inhibitory activity at 100 µM against PTP1B, while substitutions at the para or meta position of the phenyl ring with benzyl moieties bring the IC50 values of compounds LZP4, LZP38 and LZP25 to the low micromolar range. Clearly, bulky hydrophobic substitutions on the phenyl ring enhance the affinity of aryl diketoacids for PTP1B. We then determined whether dimerization of the aryl diketoacids would improve inhibition of PTP1B activity. Aryl diketoacid dimer formation was achieved through either a piperazino or cyclohexane-1,4-trans-diamine linker (Figure 1). To our delight, the piperazine- or cyclohexane diamine-linked aryl diketoacid dimers LZP6, LZP7, LZP37, and LZP40 showed improved PTP1B inhibitory activity over the corresponding monomers (LZP4, LZP25, and LZP38), with IC50 values in the low micromolar range (Table 2). To determine the inhibition constant and mode of inhibition by LZP25 and LZP6, the effect of the inhibitors on PTP1Bcatalyzed reaction was studied at 8 different pNPP and 4 different compound concentrations. As shown by the Line-

by LZP25 and LZP6, we decided to solve the three-dimensional structure of the complexes.
Structures of the PTP1B · LZP25 Complex. Using conditions similar to those described previously,19,22 we produced crystals of the PTP1B · LZP25 complex that diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution (Table 3). The structures were solved by molecular replacement. The final model for the PTP1B · LZP25 complex included PTP1B residues 2-284 and all atoms of the inhibitor. Binding of pTyr or nonhydrolyzable pTyr mimetics are usually accompanied by the closure of the flexible WPD loop (residues 179-187).19,22,30 Thus, it was striking to find that the WPD loop adopts an open conformation; the overall structure of PTP1B · LZP25 is similar to the ligand-free PTP1B structure in the WPD loop open form,31 with root mean square derivation (rmsd) for all R-carbon positions between the two being 0.499 Å. The major difference between the two structures is electron density in the PTP1B active site corresponding to LZP25, which was confirmed by analyzing the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc difference Fourier maps with contour levels of 1.0 and 2.5 , respectively (Figure 3A). As shown in Figure 3B, LZP25 occupies the PTP1B activesite pocket whose base corresponds to the phosphate-binding loop or P-loop (residues 214-221). The diketoacid moiety makes two hydrogen bonds with the main chain amides of the P-loop, one polar interaction with the side chain of Arg221, one hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl side chain of Ser216, and two additional polar interactions with the side chains of Gln266 and Tyr46, respectively. Besides these polar interactions, there are also ample van der Walls contacts between PTP1B and LZP25. For example, the phenyl ring immediately attached to the diketoacid has extensive hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of residues lining up the active-site cavity, including Tyr46, Val49, Ala217, and Ile219. There are also van der Walls contacts between the two carbon atoms of the terminal ketoacid moiety and the side-chain of Gln262. Additionally, one of the distal phenyl rings in LZP25 forms hydrophobic interactions with residues Asp48 and Gln262, while the other makes van der Walls contacts with residues Tyr46, Arg47, and Asp48. These additional nonpolar interactions with the distal phenyl ring(s) may be responsible for the higher affinity of LZP4, LZP38, and LZP25, in comparison with those (LZP36, LZP3, and LZP39) that lack the distal aromatic substitutions (Table 1).

The observation that LZP25, a putative pTyr surrogate, was not competitive with substrate is rather intriguing. This is especially so because noncompetitive PTP1B inhibitors have previously been found to bind an allosteric site located 20 Å from the active site.29 Kinetic analysis indicated that dimeric LZP6 is also a noncompetitive inhibitor of PTP1B with a Ki of 12 ( 0.6 µM. Noncompetitive inhibition of PTP1Bcatalyzed reaction by LZP25 and LZP6 was also apparent when the data were analyzed by Eadie-Hofstee plot (Figure S1). Given the lack of a formal charge in the aryl diketoacid dimer, it is not at all clear where the binding site for LZP6 is in PTP1B. To provide insight into the molecular basis for PTP1B inhibition

flexibility to control solvent accessibility, recruit functional residues for catalysis, and/or facilitate the binding and release of substrate or product. For the PTPs, the major conformational change essential to substrate binding and catalysis is restricted to the movement of the WPD loop, which harbors the general acid/base (Asp181 in PTP1B). Crystallographic studies have captured the WPD loop either in the open or closed conformations.30,32,33 Spectroscopic measurements indicate that in solution ligand-free PTP exists as an equilibrium mixture of

both the open and closed forms, and that ligand binding stabilizes the closed conformation.34-36 Although LZP25 occupies the active site, the manner by which it interacts with PTP1B is significantly different from those observed between pTyr and PTP1B (Figure 3C). A key difference is how Arg221 in the P-loop is engaged by the ligand. When pTyr or an optimal nonhydrolyzable pTyr mimetic is bound at the active site, a bidentate hydrogen bond is formed between the oxyanion and the guanidinium group of Arg221.19,22,30 This event triggers a series of interactions between Arg221 and the side chains of the invariant Glu115 as well as Trp179 in the WPD loop, which are likely responsible for the stabilization of the closed conformation.37-39 The phenyl ring of pTyr is then effectively buried within the active-site cavity, created by the nonpolar sidechains of Ala217 and Ile219 of the P-loop, Phe182 of the WPD loop, Tyr46, Val49 and Gln262.

including Arg221 are less optimal and insufficient to trigger the WPD loop closure. Moreover, the position of the diketoacid proximal phenyl ring is nearly perpendicular to that of pTyr, which would cause a steric clash with Phe182 if the WPD loop were in the closed conformation. Thus, the WPD loop adopts an open conformation in the PTP1B · LZP25 complex. It appears that, depending on the specific interactions with the PTP, an active site-directed ligand can either bind the active-site cleft in the WPD loop open or closed conformation. Structure of the PTP1B · LZP6 Complex. Dimerization of aryl diketoacids through a piperazino or cyclohexane-1,4-transdiamine linkage generated several PTP1B inhibitors with improved potencies over their monomeric counterparts (Tables 1 and 2). This is a novel finding because, unlike other PTP1B inhibitors, these dimeric compounds have no negative charge(s), which are usually required for binding to the highly positively charged PTP active site. To better understand the mode of interaction between PTP1B and the aryl diketoacid dimers, we determined the crystal structure of PTP1B in complex with LZP6, which was refined to 1.9 Å resolution (Table 3). The final model for PTP1B · LZP6 includes residues 2-283 and all atoms of LZP6. The overall structure of PTP1B in the complex is similar to that of PTP1B · LZP25, with rmsd between all R-carbon positions of the two structures at 0.211 Å. Similar to LZP25, LZP6 was unambiguously identified by well-defined electron densities in the active site, and the WPD loop in the PTP1B · LZP6 structure is also in the open conformation (Figure

4A). However, the mode of LZP6 binding is completely different from that of LZP25. Only one of the aryl diketoacid (monomer A), including the piperazino linker, is actively engaged with the PTP1B active site, while the other half (monomer B) of LZP6 appears to be solvent exposed (Figure 4B). Unlike LZP25, which has numerous polar interactions with PTP1B, only one electrostatic contact is evident between Lys118 and OB3 of LZP6, which is mediated by a water molecule. Instead, binding between PTP1B and LZP6 is dominated by hydrophobic interactions (Figure 4B). Specifically, the phenyl ring directly adjacent to the keto group in monomer A makes numerous van der Waals contacts with the side chains of Tyr46, Ser216, Ala217, Ile219, and Gln262. Interestingly, this phenyl ring sits at approximately the same location occupied by the aromatic moiety of pTyr seen in the PTP1B · pTyr complex (Figure 4C and ref.19). In addition, the piperazine linker also makes hydrophobic contacts with Tyr46. Without any formal charge, the terminal phenyl ring in monomer A does not point to the bottom of the active site and interact with the P-loop, as is the case for the phosphoryl group in pTyr. Rather, the ring extends across the active-site cleft and makes multiple nonpolar interac-

tions with the side chains of Trp179, Phe182, Arg221, and Thr263 (Figure 4B). Specific interactions between LZP6 terminal phenyl ring and residues Trp179 and Phe182 also effectively block the WPD loop closure, thereby providing a structural basis for the open conformation observed in the PTP1B · LZP6 complex. Collectively, the structure reveals that LZP6 binds PTP1B in the WPD loop open conformation and covers the active-site pocket like a lid. Although half of the LZP6 molecule appears to be exposed in the solvent, symmetry operation suggests that the two phenyl rings in monomer B may interact with the side chains of Phe196 and Phe280 from another PTP1B molecule in the crystal (Figure 4D). This observation is interesting because residues Phe196 and Phe280 have been previously shown to define a hydrophobic pocket, located 20 Å from the active site, that was occupied by an allosteric inhibitor of PTP1B.29 To ascertain the significance of these symmetry related interactions, we replaced either Phe196 or Phe280 with an Ala and evaluated the effect on LZP6 binding affinity. As shown in Table 4, IC50 values of LZP6 for F196A and F280A were not significantly different from that of the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that LZP6 is unlikely to interact with these residues in solution. Similarly, Arg47 does

of LZP70 and LZP71 are slightly higher (2-3 fold) than those of LZP6 and LZP40, supporting the conclusion that LZP6 is involved in a novel mode of interaction with PTP1B active site and only half of the aryl diketoacid dimer is required for binding.
Structural and Mechanistic Basis for Noncompetitive PTP1B Inhibition by LZP25 and LZP6. Two major mechanisms of

not participate in LZP6 binding and the Arg47 to Val substitution does not alter the IC50 value for LZP6. On the contrary, substitutions at Phe182, Gln262, and Thr263 reduced PTP1B's affinity for LZP6 by 3-4 fold, which is consistent with the structural observations that these residues contribute to binding LZP6 (Figure 4C). Overall mutational data support the conclusion that symmetry-related interactions between LZP6 monomer B and Phe196 and Phe280 are likely the result of crystal packing. To further substantiate the observed binding mode between PTP1B and LZP6, we analyzed several compounds structurally related to LZP6 (Table 2). LZP7, LZP37, and LZP40 possess chemical entities similar to those present in LZP6 that are known to be important for interactions with PTP1B active site. Accordingly, these compounds possess either comparable (LZP7) or enhanced (LZP37 and LZP40) inhibitory activities to that of LZP6. In contrast, LZP8 and LZP9 lack the terminal phenyl ring predicted to make a number of key contacts with PTP1B. As expected, they are less potent than LZP6 and exhibit no inhibitory activity against PTP1B at 100 µM. To directly test whether one aryl diketoacid moiety is sufficient for binding, we synthesized monomeric versions of LZP6 and LZP40, in which one of the aryl diketoacid is replaced by a tert-butyl dicarbonate (BOC) group. As shown in Table 2, the IC50 values

reversible enzyme inhibition are commonly described in textbooks. In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds to the active site in place of the substrate, thus preventing the enzymecatalyzed reaction. Competitive inhibition increases the apparent Km, which can be overcome by high substrate concentration due to mass action. In noncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds to the enzyme at an allosteric site that is distinct from the active site. This type of inhibition reduces the maximum rate of an enzymatic reaction without affecting the apparent binding affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. The decrease in Vmax occurs as a result of conformational changes in the active site induced by the presence of the inhibitor in the allosteric site. Our kinetic analyses indicate that LZP25 and LZP6 act as noncompetitive inhibitors of PTP1B. Unlike classical noncompetitive inhibitors, however, both LZP25 and LZP6 occupy the active site, rather than an allosteric site away from the active site. Although the specific binding modes differ between the two compounds, one common feature from the structures of PTP1B · LZP25 and PTP1B · LZP6 is that the WPD loop is in the open conformation. Molecular modeling suggests that substrate pNPP can still be accommodated by PTP1B's active site in the presence of either LZP25 or LZP6 (Figure 5). Because PTP catalysis requires the WPD loop in the closed conformation, which positions the general acid Asp181 close to the scissile

oxygen of the substrate for efficient proton transfer,37-39 the LZP25- or LZP6-bound PTP1B is catalytically incompetent. Consequently, substrate turnover cannot occur when LZP25 or LZP6 is present in the PTP1B active site, because the catalytically essential residues are not optimally aligned to promote pNPP hydrolysis. Thus, consistent with the mode of noncompetitive inhibition, there is no competition between the aryl diketoacid-based inhibitors and the substrate. The mechanism for LZP25 and LZP6-mediated PTP1B inhibition derives from the fact that they stabilize the open, inactive conformation of the WPD loop, thereby reducing the concentration of the catalytically competent enzyme, leading to a decrease in Vmax. Cellular Activity of LZP25 and LZP6. Given the observed potency of LZP25 and LZP6 for PTP1B, we proceeded to evaluate their ability to inhibit PTP1B inside the cell. Previous studies have demonstrated that PTP1B serves as a negative regulator of the insulin activated signaling pathways by catalyzing the dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor (IR ) subunit. Thus, inhibition of PTP1B activity should enhance insulin signaling. Indeed, IR phosphorylation in the liver of the PTP1B knockout mice is prolonged by 2-fold.3,4 PTP1B knockdown by antisense in rat hepatoma cells yields a 2.3-fold increase in the level of phosphorylated IR .40 In addition, significant enhancements in IR phosphotyrosine levels are also observed with cell-permeable analogues of a potent and selective small-molecule PTP1B inhibitor.41 To examine the specificity of LZP25 and LZP6 for PTP1B, their inhibitory activities toward a panel of PTPs including cytosolic PTPs, HePTP, SHP2, and Lyp, the receptor-like PTPs, LAR and PTPR, and the dual specificity phosphatase, VHR, were determined. As shown in Table 5, LZP25 and LZP6 display at least several-fold selectivity for PTP1B over all PTPs examined. To determine the cellular efficacy of LZP25 and LZP6, we assessed their effect on insulin signaling in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. The cells were incubated with either 150 µM (7.5 of the IC50 value) LZP25 or 60 µM (3.75× of the IC50 value) LZP6 for 20 min and subsequently treated either with or without insulin (100 nM) for 5 min. Cell lysates were resolved by SDSPAGE, then the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with antiphospho-IR (pY1162/pY1163)

antibodies. As shown in Figure 6A, incubation of cells with LZP25 had no significant effect on IR phosphorylation, while LZP6 treatment increased insulin stimulated IR phosphorylation by 230%. Given that LZP25 and LZP6 have similar affinity for PTP1B, the results suggest that LZP25 is not cell permeable, whereas LZP6 is capable of penetrating the cellular membrane. If the carboxylic acid in LZP25 obstructs cell membrane penetration, then masking the acid with the piperazino linker should improve its cellular activity. Indeed, when cells were treated with LZP70 or LZP71 at 4× of their respective IC50 values, both compounds were able to augment the insulin stimulated IR phosphorylation to the same extent (2-fold) as effected by LZP6 at equivalent concentration (Figure 6B). We further demonstrated that LZP6 can potentiate insulin signaling in a dose dependent manner, exhibiting cellular activity at both 15 and 30 µM (1 and 2× IC50) concentrations (Figure 6C). Implications for PTP1B Inhibitor Development. As mentioned above, there is compelling evidence that define PTP1B as an outstanding target for the treatment of a number of human diseases. A major challenge in drug discovery programs targeted toward the PTPs is to identify inhibitory compounds with pharmacologically acceptable bioavailability. Most PTP active site-directed pharmacophores identified at present are negatively charged pTyr mimetics and therefore cannot readily enter the cell. This lack of cell permeability limits the utility of such compounds in signaling studies and further therapeutic development. We show in this study that LZP25 and LZP6 function as noncompetitive PTP1B inhibitors and bind the active site in distinct fashions that effectively block the WPD loop closure, thereby preventing formation of the catalytically competent form of the enzyme. This is in stark contrast to other pTyr mimetics, which bind the WPD loop closed conformation. As depicted in Figure 7, the electrostatic potential and topology of the catalytic cleft are considerably different between the WPD loop open and closed forms. Moreover, with the WPD loop in the open conformation the active-site pocket is substantially larger with greater hydrophobic binding surface. Thus, in comparison to the WPD closed form, the open conformation presents a unique opportunity for developing active site-directed PTP inhibitors with improved pharmacological properties. It has proven difficult to develop effective uncharged PTP active site-directed small-molecule inhibitors, due primarily

to the electrostatic properties of the PTP active site. We provide the first example in which a neutral compound LZP6 can engage PTP1B active site in such a way as to maintain the open, inactive conformation of the WPD loop, without resorting to electrostatic interactions with the P-loop. Notably, LZP6 exhibits excellent cell permeability and enhances insulin signaling in HepG2 cells. Further increase in potency could be achieved by appending an appropriate chemical group to LZP6 to fill the space taken by pNPP (Figure 5B). Moreover, binding specificity can be improved by tethering LZP6 to appropriate functional groups in order to engage additional unique surface areas that border the PTP1B active site. Given the conserved structural and catalytic properties of the PTP active site, it is expected that targeting the inactive, WPD loop open conformation could represent a general and effective strategy applicable to all PTPs.
