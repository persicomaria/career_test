To be effective againstgram-negativeorganisms,fl-lactam antibiotics must be able to penetratethe outer membrane. For Escherichia coli, thesecompoundsgenerally cross this barrier through non-specific channnelsin porins OmpF and OmpC. In vitro studieshave shown that increasedpH induces a switch in the structureof OmpF and OmpC from a small channelconformation to a set of larger-sizedchannelconformations. In this study, the permeability of two cephalosporins into cells producing either OmpC or OmpF was examined at various pHs. The results suggestthat the pH-inducedswitch in channelsize observedin Academic 1°C. Press, vitro also occurs in vivo. 0 1992

The outer membraneof gram-negativebacteria acts as a permeability barrier protecting the cells against deleteriousagentssuch as antibiotics and bile salts while allowing the flux of small metabolitesand nutrients. Pore-formingproteins, such as OmpF and OmpC in E. coli, are responsiblefor the permeability of small hydrophilic compoundsacross the outer membrane. The influx of antibiotics such as /3-lactams through theseporin channelsis one determinateof fi-lactam effectiveness;other determinates include the level of fl-lactamase activity within the periplasmic spaceand affinity of @-lactams penicillin-binding proteins for presentin the periplasm. Several studieshave shown that the acidity of the media can affect porin function in vitro (l-4). Specifically, we have found in in vitro studiesthat increased pH inducesa switch from a small-size to a set of larger-sizedchannelsfor OmpC and OmpF (4). The pK, for this switch was 6.5 for OmpC and 7.2 for OmpF (4). Other investigators have observedthat acidic conditions reduce the effectivenessof certain hydrophilic antibiotics as measuredby the m inimum inhibitory concentration,bacteriocidalactivity and postantibiotic effect; however, the causeof this reducedeffectivenesshas not been determined(47). In this study, we attemptedto determineif the pH-induced switch in porin YTowhom correspondence should be addressed.

channel size observedin vitro could be measuredin an in vivo system by assaying, at various pHs, the permeability of fl-lactams into the periplasm of cells producing either OmpC or OmpF.
METHODS

Cell Growth Escherichia coli K-12 strains ECB 621 (ompF, 1amB; gift of S. Benson) and PLB 3261 (ompC, 1amB; 8) were grown in 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.4% NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl,, pH 6.5. CephalosporinC was addedto a final concentrationof 14 pg/ml to induce &lactamase production. Cells were harvestedin mid-logarithmic growth phase. Assav for CephalosporinHydrolysis Cells were collected by centrifugation at 23,000 x g (4°C) for 15 minutes. They were washedtwice with cold 10 mM sodium phosphate,5 mM MgCl,, pH 6.5 (phosphate buffer) and resuspended phosphate in buffer at pH 5.95 or 7.4. Cells were kept on ice and aliquots were preincubated room temperaturefor 30 minutes at prior to drug addition. The rate of cephalosporinhydrolysis by intact cells or by crude /3lactamase(see below) was determinedas describedpreviously (9). Briefly, intact cells (addedat a final concentrationof +I.77 mg cell dry weight/ml) or crude fl-lactamase (added at a final concentrationof 0.46 mg protein/ml) were incubatedin a 1 mm cuvette in phosphatebuffer (at either pH 5.95 or 7.4) containing either 431 PM cephalosporinC or 323 PM cephaloridine. The rate of cephalosporinhydrolysis was measuredat room temperature for 20 minutes by the decreasein absorbance 260 nm. at Crude B-lactamasePreparation Periplasmic &lactamase was releasedfrom E. coli K-12 ECB 621 or PLB 3261 cells by spheroplastformation (10). Briefly, logarithmically-growing cells (grown as describedabove) were centrifuged, washedas above and resuspended in 0.075 M sucroseand 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.8 at one-tenththe culture volume. Lysozyme was addedto a final concentrationof 0.1 mg/ml followed by the slow addition of two volumes of 1.5 mM (ethylenedinitilo)tetraacetic acid (EDTA). All steps were performed on ice. Spheroplastswere removed by centrifugation at 23,000 x g for 15 minutes. The /3lactamasein the supematantsolution was further purified by dialysis at 4°C first against distilled water for 24 hours and then against 1 mM phosphate,0.5 mM MgCl,, pH 6.5 for 48 hours. The dialyzed sample was centrifuged at 23,000 x g for 15 minutes to remove contaminantsand lyophilized. The lyophilized "crude /3-lactamase" resuspended was in phosphatebuffer at pH 5.95 or 7.4. Protein was quantitatedusing the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce Chemical Co.).

RESULTS

AND DISCUSSION

The rate of disappearance antibiotic when addedto intact cell suspensions be of can used to determine outer membranepermeability since the enzymesinvolved in degradationof thesedrugs are located primarily in the periplasmic space(11). In this study, we measured the rate of /3-lactamhydrolysis at pH 5.95 or 7.4 using E. coli K-12 cells which contained either OmpC or OmpF as the main porin in the outer membrane(Table 1). We found that at the higher pH, the rate of @-la&amhydrolysis was significantly higher than at low pH for both strains tested. This increasedrate was observedusing either cephalosporinC or cephaloridinewhich are negatively-charged neutral, respectively, in this pH range. The or fact that the rate of cephaloridine hydrolysis was significantly lower than the rate of 1499

cephalosporinC hydrolysis (for either intact cells or crude /3-lactamase) reflects the reduction in @-lactamase activity with the former substrate(12). Since the higher rate of /3-lactamhydrolysis at the elevatedpH could result either from increasedpermeability of the outer membraneor from increased&lactamase activity at high pH, the rate of /3-lactamhydrolysis by /3-lactamase solution was measuredat pH in 5.95 and 7.4. The fi-lactamasewas isolated from OmpF- and OmpC-producingcells (Table 1). We found that b-lactamaseactivity increasedwith pH (20% for enzyme from OmpFproducing cells, 43% for enzyme from OmpC-producingcells using the substrate cephalosporinC). In comparison, Lindstrom and coworkers (12) examining chromosomalJ3lactamasefrom various strains of E. coli K-12 reported that enzymeactivity doubled with a pH increasefrom 6.5 to 7.4 (using the samebuffer and substrate);the optimal pH was 7.3. The difference betweenour results and Lindstrom' may be explainedas follows. First, the s production of /3-lactamases from E. coli K-12 strains ECB 621 and PLB 3261 was found to be inducible (data not shown) in contrast to the constitutive production of the E. coli K-12 chromosomalenzyme (12). Therefore, theseP-lactamases ight not be encodedby the same m have been reported to genesand thus may have different properties. Different /3-lactamases have different optimal pH' dependingon the type and sourceof the enzyme (13). s Investigatorshave reported a changeof 17% in TEM-type /?-lactamase activity in the pH range 5.8-7.2 (14-15). However, the fact that in our experiments,the pa-dependentchange in the rate of fl-lactam hydrolysis by crude /3-lactamase not as great as that by intact was

cells suggeststhat the increasedrate of &lactam hydrolysis by cells with pH was not the result of an increasein /3-lactamase activity alone. Also, the changein pH in the periplasm is presumably smaller than in the cell media due to the high buffering capacity of componentsin the periplasm (ie. MD0 and peptidoglycan)(15). The increasedrate of hydrolysis of the /3-lactamsat high pH is also not likely to be the result of a changein Donnan potential since increasedpH should increasethe Donnan potential (negative inside) which would decreasethe permeability of the negatively-charged cephalosporinC and have no effect on the permeability of neutral cephaloridine. Therefore, we proposethat the increasedrate of P-lactam hydrolysis at pH 7.4 is due to an enlargementof OmpF and OmpC channelsresulting in an increasein cell permeability at higher pH. This is consistent with our in vitro studies which showed that porin channel size increaseswith pH. Also, the rate of P-lactam hydrolysis was significantly lower for OmpC-producingcells than for OmpF-producing cells when measuredunder identical conditions indicating that the OmpCproducing cells have smaller channels. This is in agreementwith the smaller channel size measuredfor OmpC in vitro (4). In conclusion, thesedata suggestthat the pH-induced switch in channel size observed using in vitro methods, also occurs in vivo. This phenomenon could explain the "intrinsic resistance"of gram-negativebacteria to some hydrophilic antibiotics at acidic pH which has been reported even in strains lacking /3-lactamase (7). The fact that there is a reduction in OmpF production and an increasein OmpC production at acidic pH (17) could also explain the reduction in /3-lactameffectivenessat acidic pH. However, a transcriptional control could not explain our results since permeability was measuredover a very short time range and under conditions where cells were not actively metabolizing. This acid-inducedreduction in porin channel size should be consideredwhen developing new drugs; antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections may need to be active in acidic environs such as phagolysosomes, sites of bacterial infection and inactivation (5, 7), and be able to penetrate urine or abscesses, a very small channel.
