The notion that the ribosome is dynamic has been supported by various biochemical techniques, as well as by differences observed in highresolution structures of ribosomal complexes frozen in various functional states. Yet, the mechanisms and extent of rRNA dynamics are still largely unknown. We have used a novel, fast chemical-modification technique to provide time-resolved details of 16 S rRNA structural changes that occur as bridges are formed between the ribosomal subunits as they associate. Association of different 16 S rRNA regions was found to be a sequential, multi-step process involving conformational rearrangements within the 30 S subunit. Our results suggest that key regions of 16 S rRNA, necessary for decoding and tRNA A-site binding, are structurally altered in a timedependent manner by association with the 50 S ribosomal subunits.

Introduction
Active ribosomes, ubiquitous in all living systems, are composed of two subunits of unequal size that associate and dissociate from one another with each cycle of mRNA translation. Although these processes are facilitated by protein cofactors, the essential recognition elements are intrinsic to the ribosomal subunits. The connections between the subunits serve a vital role, since, in addition to holding the ribosome together, they are likely conduits for signal transmission between the 30 S decoding subunit and the 50 S catalytic subunit. The structural aspects of the association of ribosomal subunits have been the subject of many different studies using a variety of techniques. Early studies by Noller's group1,2 used footprinting methods to identify sites on rRNAs that were protected upon subunit association. Later footprinting studies giving greater detail identified a number of rRNA sites that participate in subunit association.3,4 Crosslinking was also used to show

interactions between the 23 S and 16 S rRNA after association.5 Inter-subunit bridges were initially visualized using cryo-electron microscopy.6­8 X-ray crystallography of 70 S ribosomes by Noller's group showed details of 12 inter-subunit bridges, most of which were composed of rRNA.9,10 These bridges were then confirmed to be present in solution with cryo-electron microscopy in prokaryotic11,12 and eukaryotic ribosomes.13 By using a chemical modification interference approach, Maivali & Remme14 identified those bridging residues in the 50 S subunit that play a role in subunit association. These studies, taken as a whole, lead to a picture of the two subunits being associated through a number of tentacle-like interactions of rRNA and rRNA/protein bridges, some having a more central role than others. The kinetic aspects of the association process have also been under scrutiny for some time. As early as the mid 1970s, Grunberg-Manago and co-workers looked at the effects of Mg2C on the kinetics of subunit association,15,16 and Noll and co-workers reported on various kinds of ribosomes, defining some as tight couples and loose couples, depending upon their propensity to dissociate at moderate levels of Mg2C.17 Recent studies by Nierhaus and co-workers have shown that the association process follows first-order kinetics and

have identified a large activation energy needed for the 30 S subunit to participate in association.18 The kinetics of the association process has recently also been studied by Ehrenberg's group using stoppedflow and Rayleigh light-scattering.19 These results indicate that the association process is quite rapid and very complex, with numerous contacts being made between the subunits as association takes place. Additionally, there is considerable evidence that the ribosome is a dynamic particle, with substantial movement of various domains not only during the association process, but also during the translational process itself.11,20­28 While kinetic studies can indicate the dynamics of these processes, and crystal structures as well as cryo-EM models can provide snapshots at certain times, the details of functional conformational changes that occur as the ribosome is assembled, the subunits associate, or translation takes place remain unknown to a large degree. In this study we use a novel approach, rapid nonequilibrium probing, to monitor the chemical reactivity of nucleotide bases in 16 S rRNA in real time as the 30 S and 50 S ribosomal subunits are associated. This technique couples rapid mixing in a quench-flow apparatus with the power of chemical footprinting to characterize time-resolved reactivity of specific nucleotides. Thus, during subunit association, the reactive rRNA bases involved can be monitored at discrete, short time-intervals as association of the subunits occurs. These timeresolved data allowed us to construct a model wherein some regions of the rRNA bind initially and generate structural changes that allow the remaining contacts to be made for complete association of the two subunits. The results clearly show that some regions of the rRNA interact almost instantly, while other regions react at a later time. The results also suggest that these initial interactions trigger other structural changes that may be required for the transition of independent active 30 S ribosomal subunits into the 30 S subunits of the 70 S ribosome.

Results
Validation of the method Initially, it was essential to determine the limits of the non-equilibrium probing approach with respect to modification and quench reaction times. The design was to use a standard quench-flow apparatus containing four syringes and two variable delay lines to allow the necessary components to be added. The first two syringes contained the components to be mixed, the third contained the chemical modification reagent (dimethyl sulfate (DMS) in this study), and the fourth a quench solution to stop the modification reaction. A diagram of the apparatus is shown in Figure 1(a). The design of the apparatus allowed the

sequential rapid mixing of reactants in millisecond to second timescales by changing the delay lines and flow parameters. The initial question was the rapidity of the DMS reaction and quench. Ultimately, the lower limit of time of reaction of two components would be the sum of the delay time (incubation of the reactants), modification time and quench time. It was necessary to identify a stop solution which was sufficiently reactive to quench the DMS yet not be deleterious toward the rRNA. A 1:1 (v/v) solution of EtOH/b-mercaptoethanol proved to be satisfactory for this purpose. Early titrations of DMS concentration showed that at final concentrations of DMS less than 2% (v/v) resulted in titrations of modification for DMS reaction times over 6­12 ms (data not shown). When a final DMS solution of 3% (v/v) is used and the amount of quench solution titrated, it was possible to find the amount of quench necessary to stop the DMS reaction in times of less than 10 ms. Figure 1(b) shows the titration of quench in a 12 ms DMS reaction by monitoring the modification of A702 in the 16 S rRNA, that has been shown to become protected by association.4 The difference in modification between quench volumes starts to approach zero after two volumes of stop solution. The amount of modification at 2.5 volumes of quench is w90% that of two volumes. A requirement for a time-resolved assay of base accessibility via a chemical modifier is that the modification reaction be much faster (Otenfold) than the reaction studied. At a 3% (v/v) concentration of DMS (w300 mM) the fast phase of modification is complete before the shortest delay time (6 ms) physically available. This time is defined by the necessity to deliver a large volume of quench relative to that of the other components while not exceeding a maximum flow rate. Figure 1(c) shows a titration of DMS reaction time from 6 ms to 25 ms using 3% and 4% final concentrations of DMS. A stable level of modification is seen for the earliest time-points, after which a second phase of modification appears that is likely due to an alteration in RNA structure caused by DMS. This leads to over-modification that can be seen in the primer extensions as a general increase (data not shown) in background as the modification is allowed to proceed beyond 15­20 ms. All experiments performed in this study used a 3% DMS concentration. The results of these studies show that fast modification can be achieved and differences resolved using modification times less than 6 ms. However, it is also apparent that differences in modification time for different experiments must have independent controls. All experiments performed for this study used modification times between 12 ms and 25 ms, and separate controls were carried out for each modification time. Subunit association at equilibrium It was imperative that we use some independent

Figure 1. The parameters for the rapid modification of the rRNA with DMS were defined by titrating the amount of DMS quench and the time of DMS modification. Modification of A702 in the 16 S rRNA of 30 S subunits was used as a model for establishing the parameters. (a) A diagram of the flow path for the Bio-logic SFM-400 four syringe quench-flow apparatus used in these experiments. (b) The volume of quench solution used in the experiments was titrated using a 12 ms DMS modification. The results are expressed as the absolute intensity (units of the Fuji phosphorimager) of the primer extension stop at A702 versus the ratio of quench solution over the volume of probing reaction. The amount of solution required for efficient stop is indicated by a lack of decrease in the modification of A702. (c) The reaction times of DMS were titrated at A702. The fast phase of the reaction occurs much earlier than the earliest time point taken. At a final concentration of 4% (v/v) DMS (squares), the titration shows no increase in modification before 15 ms after which a second phase of modification is observed that is probably the result of the over-modification of the rRNA. At 3% DMS (triangles) the early phase is extended before a second phase is observed. The background of bases in unmodified control reactions is typically less than 5% of the modified value. All modifications were performed at a final concentration of 3% DMS.

method to assure that, under the conditions of this study, subunit association was occurring and 70 S ribosomes were being formed. We used an analytical ultracentrifuge to run sedimentation patterns on ribosomal subunits at various magnesium concentrations, with and without poly(U) present and compared the results with fast modification of the same complexes at equilibrium. The analytical ultracentrifuge results (Figure 2(a)) indicated that under the buffer conditions used (10 mM Mg2C) more than 50% of the 30 S particles were associated after a ten minute incubation at 37 8C. These results agreed with the 12 ms probing data (Figure 2(b)). Preformed 70 S ribosomes were modified for 12 ms at the various Mg2C concentrations. The level of modification remains the same as, or slightly greater than that of 30 S controls until 10 mM

Mg2C concentration is reached. Also, whereas subunits alone at 6 mM Mg2C produced only a small proportion of 70 S subunits, with poly(U) present, over 50% of 30 S subunits associated at 6 mM Mg2C, with the presence of polysomes evident (Figure 2(c)). The stabilizing influence on subunit association of poly(U) and, to a lesser extent natural mRNA, is also apparent from fast probing of the complexes (Figure 2(d)). This information, coupled with the fact that replicate 30 S and 70 S controls for every time-point were run, provided assurance that the time-dependent changes we observed are a product of subunit association. As an example, the primer extension results of various time-points from probing the association process at base A702 are provided (Figure 3). The time-points ranging from 25 ms to 650 ms show the time-course

Figure 2. The level of subunit association at equilibrium was determined by analytical ultracentrifugation and compared with results from DMS modification protection at 16 S rRNA base A702, which is known to be protected by association. (a) Schlieren images from a Beckman model E analytical ultracentrifuge showing the increase in association of ribosomal subunits (2 mM 30 S, 4 mM 50 S) as the level of Mg2C increases. There are no apparent 70 S ribosomes at 1.5 mM Mg2C and between 60% and 70% of the 30 S subunits can be seen to become associated in 70 S ribosomes at 10 mM Mg2C. (b) The same result can be seen in the protection of A702 due to subunit association (1 mM 30 S, 2mM 50 S). These ribosomes were formed and then probed for 12 ms with DMS and analyzed by primer extension. The results are expressed in PSL units from a Fuji FLA-3000G phosphorimager. At levels of Mg2C lower than 10 mM modification of A702 is slightly greater than that of 30 S subunits alone. (c) The effect of poly(U) on the equilibrium position of subunit association is apparent in this Schlieren image. At 6 mM Mg2C with poly(U) the level of 70 S ribosome formation is

of increasing protection at A702 as association proceeds. Three separate modification times were used for the various points and relevant controls were provided. Normalization of these points coupled with replicate runs provide the data shown in Figure 6(g). Determination of the association rate constant ka for ribosomal subunits To verify the validity of the results of the rapid non-equilibrium probing technique a rate constant for association was determined in the buffer conditions used for these experiments. The rate was determined by light-scattering in a fast mixing stopped-flow instrument. It is well known that the concentration of magnesium ions, ionic strength and composition of the buffer have a profound effect on the rate and accuracy of protein synthesis.29 It has also been demonstrated that the association rate constant of "empty" ribosomal subunits increases by almost an order of magnitude when the Mg 2C concentration in the buffer increases from 4 mM to 8 mM.16 Figure 4 shows that the rate constant of subunit association is 14 mMK1 sK1. The light-scattering results verify that association of subunits occurs in the same timescale as the rapid probing results we report here. Determination of an exact association rate constant is challenging with the rapid probing technique. This is due, for the most part, to the fact that the individual bases involved in the process are observed rather than the global association product. Thus, portions of the 30 S interact with the 50 S subunit at varying rates, as observed by changes in the reactivity of local bases. As will be discussed, the formation of ribosomes from subunits is seen to proceed by steps with a minimum of two rates. Furthermore, the extent of association in these lightscattering experiments is estimated at 52% of the 30 S subunits (data not shown). This is similar to the amount of relative protection we found between 30 S and 70 S with poly(U) in our equilibrium probing results shown in Figure 2. Design of the study We studied three different regions of 16 S rRNA in the 30 S ribosomal subunit that are involved in inter-subunit bridges: helix 23 (the 700 region), helix 27 (the 900 region), and helix 44 (the 1400 region) (Figure 5). These regions represent 16 S nucleotides participating in four separate bridges (B2a, B2c, B5 and B7a; Figure 5) that form between the subunits.9 Activated 30 S and 50 S subunits with poly(U) as mRNA were used here. After mixing the 30 S subunits containing poly(U) with 50 S subunits,

the samples were delayed for time-intervals varying from 25 ms to five seconds (these times include the time of modification, which varied from 12 ms to 25 ms) and then quenched. The 16 S rRNA was then extracted, sequenced using primer extension, and the resulting time-dependent reactivity of various bases monitored. 50 S protections of H44 The penultimate stem­loop (helix 44; bases 1399­ 1504) of 16 S rRNA is situated almost vertically across the body of the 30 S ribosomal subunit on the interface side in an ideal position to mediate subunit association (Figure 5). Previous footprinting studies reported several bases that were protected from DMS modification upon association of subunits.2­4,30 These bases included A1413, A1418, A1441 and A1394. We found that bases A1408, A1413, A1418 and A1441 were protected by association with the 50 S subunit in a time-dependent manner. A1394 was poorly reactive using this technique, but baseline-level protection (lowest stable level of modification) at A1408, A1413 and A1418 was rapid (less than 100 ms) upon the addition of the 50 S subunit. However, the behavior of A1408 was somewhat different, with reactivity diminished at the earliest time-point measured (25 ms), followed by a rapid decrease to baselinelevel protection (Figure 6(a)­(c)). On the other hand, A1413 and A1418 exhibited biphasic behavior with slower initial decrease in reactivity followed by a rapid decline. 50 S protections of H27 The earliest changes we observed were in helix 27. This helix lies directly behind and in contact with the 1413 region of H44 (Figure 7). Helix 27 (nucleotides 885­912) has been the focus of much attention concerning its possible role in 30 S subunit dynamics, although the details of how and when H27 moves are still unknown.31­37 We found the reactivity of bases in H27 to be both protected and enhanced very rapidly in a manner suggesting a rearrangement of the local structure. To an even greater extent than with A1408, there is a very rapid influence of the 50 S subunit, independent of and prior to, A1413 and A1418 protections. For instance, the level of modification at base A908 is substantially reduced at even the earliest time-point (25 ms) (Figure 6(d)), suggesting a protective influence from association before the earliest time-point taken. At the other extreme, base A892, which is stacked upon A908, was found to be more reactive to DMS at the earliest time-points (Figure 6(e)), following which it returns to a reactivity equivalent to that of 30 S

equivalent to or slightly greater than that of subunits alone at 10 mM Mg2C. (d) DMS probing at A702 of associated subunits shows greater protection in the presence of poly(U) or natural mRNA at 10 mM Mg2C. These results are expressed as reactivity relative to A702 in 30 S subunits with poly(U) and no 50 S subunits, as determined by phosphorimager analysis of the primer extension gels.

subunits alone. The activity of A909 is attenuated at the earliest time-points, similar to the pattern found with A1408, and is diminished thereafter (Figure 6(f)). A late step in the association process At a much slower rate, subunit association protects A702 in helix 23 (bases 693­717) and A1441 in H44. H23 is located on the extended portion of the platform in the interface region of the 30 S ribosomal subunit (Figure 4). Base A702 is available for modification in the 30 S ribosomal subunit, and has been shown to become protected after association takes place.4 Here, this base was increasingly protected as the reaction time was extended. At 25 ms, there was little protection, but as time was extended to five seconds, the protection progressed slowly to that of the control 70 S ribosomes (Figure 6(g)). A similar result was found at A1441 with protection proceeding at an apparently slower rate (Figure 6(h)). The slower protection of A702 and A1441 stand in contrast to the rapid protection of other bases in H44 and immediate changes in H27. Computer modeling To more fully understand the sequential association process, we overlayed the structures of three published independent Thermus thermophilus 30 S crystallographic models that are available using the Ribosome Builder program . These models provide insight into the relationship between the structures of the 30 S independent of and in association with the 50 S tRNA and message. The path of the backbone from the 30 S subunit in the 70 S model containing a full complement of tRNA and mRNA was overlayed onto the two highresolution 30 S models (Protein Data Bank no. 1GIX)9 (see Figure 7). One of the models contains a P-site tRNA and P and E-site mRNA mimics (Protein Data Bank no. 1J5E)38 and the other is an activated subunit only (Protein Data Bank no. 1FKA).39 The process of overlaying the backbone positions yielded excellent overall agreement in the placement of all helices in the 30 S structures. While the axis of helix 44 remains consistent in the 30 S

and 70 S models, from the model of the 30 S subunit alone to that in a 70 S ribosome, portions of the structure are rotated with an associated small displacement toward contacts within the 50 S subunit (Figure 7(a) and (b)). There is also an associated unwinding at the top of H44 in the decoding center proximal to bridge B2a (Figure 7(c)). Our results suggest the formation of this bridge (B2a) to occur earlier than the bridges around A1418 (e.g. bridge B5), whose position between the models remains mostly stationary. Taken together with our other results (e.g. helix 27), this suggests that the most rapid protections occur in regions that must be rearranged to accommodate proper bridging. It appears that the conformational rearrangement of the upper part of H44 may be part of concerted forces between H27 and H44. But, unlike H44, H27 contacts in bridge B2c require a displacement of the 900 tetraloop to avoid steric clashes with the 23 S rRNA in the structure of the 30 S subunit alone (Protein Data Bank no. 1FKA) (Figure 7(d)). The early changes seen in H27 can be seen in the crystallographic models as resulting in a rotation of the helix, with bases A909 and A908 moving toward H44, and the backbone of H44 being locally translated toward the 50 S (Figure 7(e)).

Discussion
The results of this time-dependent study of ribosomal subunit association show changes in reactivity proceeding more rapidly at positions known to be involved in decoding as well as those involved in ribosome stability. Mainly, changes in helix 27 precede those in helix 44, with the exception of A1408, which changes at the same rate as some residues in H27. These results support a model of association in which the initial contacts include the bridges B2c and B2a of the 30 S subunit. Following this, protective interactions proceed rapidly in bridge B5 and an interaction in H44 with H27 (A1413). Finally, sites more removed from the decoding center, bridge B7a and a residue near the loop of H44, base A1441 become fully protected. Furthermore, the time-resolved reactivity of bases

A892 was hyper-reactive at the first time-point but quickly returned to background 30 S reactivity. A909, which makes a base triplet interaction with A1413G1487, was moderately protected at the earliest time-point and proceeded quickly to a background level of protection. (g) and (h) The reactivity of bases A702 and A1441 show a slow but constant decrease in reactivity (A1441 is shown with only six time-points from 25 ms to 650 ms).

uppermost bridge in helix 44, B2a, is formed between the loop of helix 69 in the 23 S rRNA and contacting bases 1408­1410 in H44, as well as making contact with P-site and A-site tRNA in the crystal structure.9 H69 was found to be disordered in the crystal structure of the 50 S subunit from Halobacterium marismortui, suggesting that contacts with 30 S and tRNA are required to constrain this helix.43 The universally conserved and potential cross-helix interaction for A1408, namely A1493 and its neighbor A1492, were also found to be less than absolutely constrained in the crystal structure of the 30 S subunit alone and are believed to rearrange in response to an A-site tRNA binding.9,38,44 Just as with A1408, bases A1492 and A1493 were also found to be protected by A-sitebound tRNA41 and by the binding of IF1,45 but not by subunit association.4 Thus, the rapid protection at A1408 may be the result of a time-dependent

positioning of H69 and organization of the decoding center in preparation for tRNA binding in the A-site. This organization takes place before the other bridge contact we studied in H44 (A1418, bridge B5a) is formed. Repositioning of H44 and disruption of a cross-helix interaction at A1408 appear to simultaneously prepare for inter-subunit contacts with H69, as well as to allow A1493 and A1492 to rotate out into the decoding center. These rearrangements may be critical for the progression of association, since modification of A1912 or A1918 in H69, a portion of the 23 S rRNA contribution to bridge B2a, was found to greatly inhibit 70 S formation.14 Since the reactivity changes seen in H27 precede the A1413 and A1418 protections, the former probably result directly from inter-subunit contacts within bridge B2c formed between helix 67 in the 50 S subunit and H27, instead of being transmitted

through H44 (Figure 7(d)). B2c is formed by an interaction between the GNRA tetraloop capping H27 and its receptor in H24 of the 16 S with bases in H67 of the 23 S. Recent studies demonstrate the importance of this interaction for the stability and function of the 70 S ribosome.33,34 Mutants in the 900 tetraloop were found to be impaired in association and displayed fidelity phenotypes. In the 70 S crystal structure a direct contact is not found in the portion of H27 containing bases A892, A908, and A909 and the 50 S subunit. However, alterations in the conformation of H27, which is located directly behind H44 (Figure 7), driven by interactions in B2c, have the potential to reposition H44 and then promote interactions between H44 and the 50 S subunit. This may be suggested by the reactivity of A909, which at the earliest time-points is attenuated and diminishes rapidly (Figure 6(f)), similar to that of A1408. The protection of A909, as well as protection of the bases in the non-canonically paired A1413-G1487 with which A909 makes a base triplet interaction,46 are class III protections.47 Class III protections are those found in 30 S subunits in response to neomycin class antibiotics, tRNA or 50 S subunit binding.9,41,47 Also, base A892 was previously identified as having enhanced reactivity in response to A-site tRNA binding.41 Thus, it appears that this conformational change, resulting in protections or enhancements previously attributed to tRNA binding (mainly A1408 and A892), occurs very early in the process of subunit association and represents a functional conformer of the 30 S ribosome. There is a large body of experimental data showing the importance of correct functional

The flexible backbone positions of 23 S rRNA H69 as it occurs in the 70 S model is shown in magenta with bridge B2a residues (cyan). (b) Bridge B2a positions of 16 S-H44 and 23 S-H69 showing the rotation/displacement of A1408 and 1410 from the activated 30 S subunit to 30 S with a P-site tRNA mimic to 30 S subunit in the 70 S ribosome. (c) From the opposite viewpoint the backbone deviation that occurs around the decoding site in an associated 30 S subunit as the helix is locally rotated. (d) Bridge B2c interactions between the 50 S (orange) and 30 S (cyan) require a displacement of the tetraloop from the activated 30 S subunit to the 30 S subunit in a 70 S ribosome, but the residues from the 30 S subunit containing a P-site tRNA mimic would not interfere with association. There is also an apparent rotation of H27 from the activated 30 S to the 30 S in the 70 S model. (e) The rotation is apparent in the backbone positions of A909 from the activated 30 S to the 30 S in the 70 S model. Positions of A909 and A1413 are shown in orange in the backbone rendering of the 30 S subunit from the 70 S model.

interactions within and surrounding H27.31,33,34,48,49 We have added here a view of H27 not simply becoming protected, but instead that the environment of the helix changes in response to factor-free subunit association in a complex manner, early in the association process. Some of the rearrangements appear to be transmitted immediately to H44. Other interactions may drive H27 to move independently of H44. This can be seen in the later time-points at A908 and A909, where protection increases even after all other residues monitored have reached a stable level of reactivity (Figure 6(d) and (f)). This provides new insight for discussion of the mechanisms at the heart of translation. In the slowest step of those studied, A702 and A1441 are gradually protected. In X-ray crystallographic models A702 appears to participate in an "A-minor" interaction with the minor groove of H68 in the 23 S rRNA.9 Given the solvent exposure of A702 in the 30 S crystal structures, it is apparently available for modification until the B7a contacts are made with the 23 S rRNA. It is also likely that it is available for interaction with the 50 S subunit unless precluded by an incorrect geometry within the 30 S subunit during initial contact between the subunits. The interactions that result in protection of A702 by its bridge partner in the 50 S subunit may facilitate or be a signal of the completion of a conformational change in the 30 S subunit. This also seems likely for the protection of A1441. A1441 does not participate in a direct interaction with the 50 S subunit. Like A702, A1441 is relatively far from the decoding center in the 30 S subunit near the loop of H44. The protection must be due to a rearrangement of this region as a result of interaction between bridge elements closer to the decoding site. As discussed earlier, the conformational rearrangement of H27 during association and the subsequent repositioning of H44 may favor association of 30 S complexes containing tRNA and/or initiation factors through a conformational rearrangement producing class III protections. The sequence of protection and activation of bases seen in our association system is suggestive of a mechanism to prevent incorrect association of empty 30 S subunits in native conditions. The passage of the 30 S subunit in this simple system through conformations previously associated with ligand binding and not association, points to an intermediate in the process, which could be stabilized by those ligands. The regions of 16 S rRNA containing bridges B2a and B2c undergo conformational rearrangement, in response to the 50 S subunit, characteristic of an induced fit between the two subunits. The 30 S structural changes found here may be facilitated in native conditions by IF1. The crystal structure of the 30 S subunit with IF1 bound50 shows changes around the decoding center relative to the unbound 30 S. These include the flipping out of A1492 and A1493, disruption of the A1493­ A1408 interaction, and a conformational change ° over a 70 A stretch of H44. The distortion in the

region of H44 that contacts H27 is most extreme in the region containing the A1413­G1487 base-pair. There is also a displacement of the platform moving it towards the decoding center. These regions containing class III protections are rearranged by the action of IF1 distorting the decoding center. Considering this and the stimulatory effect IF1 has on the rate of association,51 it becomes possible to propose a role for IF1 in catalyzing the formation of an association intermediate conformation in the 30 S subunit and preparing the A-site for tRNA binding. Further studies using all of the translation initiation factors, with natural mRNA, will be needed to identify such changes. In addition to the results obtained on subunit association in this study, we have been able to demonstrate the efficacy of a novel approach in the study of rapid conformational changes in rRNA. This study provides evidence of reactivity changes of specific nucleotides in the 16 S rRNA that occur as the ribosomal subunits associate. These protections or activations indicate subtle structural changes occurring in a time-dependent manner as association occurs. The results provide evidence that the association process is multi-phasic, with regions around the decoding center changing structure earlier than outlying regions. There is also evidence that, in the absence of factors or tRNA the 30 S subunit passes through conformers associated with these ligands during the association process. The use of this fast probing approach at various stages of translation will provide a detailed understanding of rRNA structural changes that occur in ribosomes during translation. It is evident that this approach can be applied as well to any dynamic system to observe time-dependent changes in RNA structure. With the development of additional modification reagents, this approach will be applicable to time-dependent alterations in protein structures as well.

Materials and Methods
Ribosomal subunit preparation Ribosomes were prepared from early mid-log MRE 600 Escherichia coli cells. Cells were washed and ground in alumina while frozen then salt-washed in WC buffer (25 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.6), 15 mM MgCl2, 1 M NH4Cl) to remove factors. After pelleting they were resuspended in 30/50 buffer (25 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.6), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl) and loaded onto a 1200 ml 10%­40% (w/v) sucrose gradient in a Beckman Ti-15 zonal rotor and centrifuged for 14 hours at 30,000 rpm. The 30 S and 50 S fractions were then collected and the subunits pelleted, washed and stored in NB10 (25 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mM MgCl2, 60 mM NH4Cl) buffer at K80 8C. Defining experimental parameters Fast mixing experiments were performed on a BioLogic SFM-400 (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Grenoble, France) fast mixing apparatus in quench flow mode. The four syringe, fast mixing apparatus has separate delay

lines for subunit mixing delay and DMS modification delay. Experiments were performed on 30 S subunits to identify the rate at which DMS reacted and the rate at which it could be quenched. A titration of quench volume was done on 12 ms DMS modifications of 30 S subunits. A 1 mM solution of 30 S subunits was pushed from syringe 1 and mixed with 3% (v/v) DMS and quenched with various volumes of quench solution (50% bmercaptoethanol in EtOH with 0.2 volume of 5 M NH4OAc (pH 7.6)). The titration of DMS reaction time was performed from 6 ms to 25 ms using 1 mM 30 S subunits and two volumes of quench and either a 3% or 4% final DMS concentration. We used DMS reaction times between 12 ms and 25 ms in our association studies. Reaction times with DMS were kept in this range while extending the delay times for subunit mixing. When DMS reaction times were varied separate controls were used in determining the extent of modification. Equilibrium association experiments were performed on a Beckman model E analytical ultracentrifuge. Subunits (2 mM 30 S, 4 mM 50 S) were incubated for ten minutes at 37 8C in buffers containing 25 mM Tris­HCl, 60 mM NH4Cl, and either 1.5 mM, 3 mM, 6 mM or 10 mM MgCl2 and with or without 0.2 mg/ml of poly(U) (SigmaAldrich). The mixtures were then loaded in an ANH analytical centrifuge rotor and run at 56,000 rpm. Schlieren images were taken every four minutes for 20 minutes. Probing experiments on subunits (4 mM 30 S 0.5 mM, 1 mM 50 S) were also performed after incubation buffers for ten minutes at 37 8C at the 4 Mg2C concentrations. The preformed complexes were probed for 12 ms and quenched with two volumes of stop buffer. Results were analyzed as described below. The 002B mRNA is a derivative of 002 mRNA52 with the amino acid sequence repeated to create 22 codons instead of the original ten. The mRNA was transcribed from a synthetic DNA template using T7 RNA polymerase. Two DNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and ligated together with T4 DNA ligase and a bridging oligonucleotide after which the product was gelpurified, annealed with an oligonuleotide containing the complementary T7 RNAP promoter sequence and transcribed. Determination of subunit association by stopped flow combined with light-scattering The association of ribosomal subunits was monitored with light-scattering after rapid mixing in a stopped-flow instrument (Bio-sequential SX-18MV, Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK).19,53 To determine the association rate constant of naked subunits, two mixtures, A and B, were prepared. Mixture A contained 0.25 mM or 0. 5 mM or 1 mM 30 S. Mixture B always contained 0.5 mM or 1 mM or 2 mM 50 S. The two mixtures were pre-incubated at 37 8C for ten minutes. To remove dust particles, the mixtures were centrifuged for three minutes at 14,000 rpm before they were loaded into the syringes of the stopped-flow instrument held at 20 8C for at least five minutes. After rapid mixing of equal volumes of A and B mixtures with the concentration of B particles always twice that of A particles, light-scattering at 436 nm at a right-angle to the incoming light was recorded as a function of time. Kinetics of macromolecular complex formation analyzed by stopped flow and light-scattering In a typical light-scattering experiment to monitor a

binary complex formation between particles of type A and type B, a solution containing particles A is rapidly mixed with a solution containing particles B. Initially, the mixture contains particles A and B in concentrations a(0) and b(0), respectively, while the concentration, c(0), of complex C is zero. The scattering intensity, I(t), at a time t after the mixing is the sum of the scattering intensities from free A particles, free B particles and C complexes: IðtÞ Z aðtÞIA C bðtÞIB C cðtÞIC (1)

Here, a(t), b(t) and c(t) are the concentrations of free particles A and B, and complex C, respectively. Full details of the light-scattering theory are described by Antoun et al.19 Since per every complex C formed, one particle A and one particle B are consumed, a(t)Za(0)K c(t) and b(t)Zb(0)Kc(t), so that equation (1) becomes: IðtÞ Z Ið0Þ C cðtÞDIC DIC is the increase in light-scattering intensity when the two particles A and B form a complex C. The differential equation used in deriving ka (association rate constant for 70 S complex formations) is dc/dtZKa[30 S]*[50 S]. The solution is cðtÞZ ½30 ST ð1K expðKQtÞÞ=ð1K ð½30 ST =½50 ST ÞexpðKQtÞÞC B, where [50 S]T is the total (or initial) concentration of 50 S, [30 S]T is the total (or initial) concentration of 30 S and QZ Ka([50 S]K[30 S]T). The scattered light intensity is given by IðtÞZ A1ð1K expðKQtÞÞ=ð1K ½30 ST =½50 ST expðKQtÞÞC B1, with A1 and B1 as experimental parameters. In the light-scattering experiments of this study [50 S]TZ2[30 S]T, so that QZ ka[30 S]T and the amplitude A1 of the intensity signal depends linearly on the concentration of subunits. Fast probing experiments Syringes 1 and 2 contained 30 S subunits, 50 S subunits or NB10 buffer depending on the experiment. Subunits were activated by incubation in NB10 buffer at 37 8C for ten minutes immediately prior to use. The 30 S and 50 S mixing experiment used 1 mM 30 S, 2 mg/ml of poly(U) versus 2 mM 50 S and were mixed in a 1:1 ratio by volume. All experiments were made using a 6:100 mixing ratio between 50% DMS in EtOH delivered from syringe 3 and sample pushed from syringes 1 and 2. DMS reaction delay times varied depending upon experimental design between 12 ms and 25 ms. Delay times for the mixing of subunits were 25, 41, 50, 83, 150, 250, 350, 650 and 5100 ms. These delays represent the total time from first mixing of subunits to quench. Control experiments for 70 S and 30 S were mixed 1:1 (v/v) against buffer with the final concentration the same as the 30 S/50 S mixing experiments and experiments with the same delay times as the 30 S/50 S mixing experiments were used. The 70 S ribosomes for controls were formed by pre-incubating 30 S and 50 S subunits in a 1:2 molar ratio for ten minutes at 37 8C in NB10 buffer with poly(U) (0.2 mg/ml). DMS reactions were stopped by mixing two volumes (twice the volume delivered from syringes 1 and 2) of quench buffer from syringe 4. Delay lines were washed with a minimum of ten volumes of buffer between experiments. rRNA was extracted (twice with phenol, twice with 1:1 (v/v) phenol/chloroform and twice with chloroform) after precipitation and then re-precipitated. Analysis of probing experiments Samples were sequenced using (5 0 - 32P)-labeled DNA oligonucleotides complementary to sites less than 100

bases from the modified base of interest. Extension was done using AMV-RT (Seikagaku America) and loaded onto a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide sequencing gel and electrophoresed for an appropriate period of time. The gels were exposed and bands quantified using a Fuji FLA3000G phosphorimager and Image Gauge software (Fuji Biomedical). Band intensity was normalized using overall lane intensity. Normalization coefficients were applied to all results of bands on that gel. Relative reactivity was established by setting normalized band intensity in 30 S control experiments of the same DMS reaction time to 1. All controls and experiments were repeated at least three times and the standard deviation between the normalized intensity of bands was used to generate error bars. Alignment of ribosomal subunit models Two different PDB models of ribosomal subunits were aligned by the Ribosome Builder program using a helix alignment algorithm. This algorithm uses vectors directed along the helices of the rRNA chains and then searches for the best alignment of the subunits using a pair of helix vectors. The vector of a helix is defined by two points, A and B. Point A is the midpoint between the backbone atoms of residues R5b and R3e, where R5b is the beginning residue of the 5 0 side of the helix and R3e is the ending residue of the 3 0 side of the helix. Point B is the midpoint between the backbone atoms of residues R5e and R3b, where R5e is the ending residue of the 5 0 side of the helix and R3b is the beginning residue of the 3 0 side of the helix. Let the two PDB models be called model i and model j, where model j will be aligned to model i. For a given pair of helices H1 and H2 that are defined in both models, let the vectors of H1 and H2 in model i be named vH1i and vH2i, and let the vectors of H1 and H2 in model j be named vH1j and vH2j. Model j is aligned to model i in three steps. In step 1, model j is translated so that the beginning endpoint of vH1j is aligned with the corresponding endpoint of vH1i (Figure 1). In step 2, model j is rotated about an angle q so that vH1j is aligned with vH1i (Figure 2). In step 3, model j is rotated about an angle f, where f is the angle between vectors vPmi and vPmj where these vectors are formed by projecting the midpoints of vH2i and vH2j into the plane defined by vH1i (Figure 3). This results in the best possible alignment of the second helix vectors while maintaining the alignment between the first helix vectors. To find the pair of helices that will produce the best alignment between the two PDB models, each helix in model i is iterated. If the corresponding helix exists in model j, model j is transformed so that the helices are aligned as described in steps 1 and 2 above. Then, starting with model j in this intermediate transformation, each remaining helix in model i is iterated. If the corresponding helix exists in model j, then model j is transformed so that the second helices are optimally aligned as described in step 3 above. After each alignment, the RMS difference is computed between the backbone atoms of all residues in the rRNA chains of the two models. The helix pair that produces the smallest RMSD value is then used for the actual alignment of the PDB models.
