Abstract Manganese peroxidase (MnP) from the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium contains a manganese-binding site that plays a critical role in its function. Previously, a MnII-binding site was designed into cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) based on sequence homology (Yeung et al. in Chem. Biol. 4:215­ 222, 1997; Gengenbach et al. in Biochemistry 38:11425­ 11432, 1999). Here, we report a redesign of this site based on X-ray structural comparison of MnP and CcP. The variant, CcP(D37E, V45E, H181E), displays 2.5fold higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) than the variant in the original design, mostly due to a stronger KM of 1.9 mM (vs. 4.1 mM). High-resolution X-ray crystal structures of a metal-free form and a form with CoII at the designed MnII site were also obtained. The metal

ion in the engineered metal-binding site overlays well with MnII bound in MnP, suggesting that this variant is the closest structural model of the MnII-binding site in MnP for which a crystal structure exists. A major difference arises in the distances of the ligands to the metal; the metal­ligand interactions in the CcP variant are much weaker than the corresponding interactions in MnP, probably owing to partial occupancy of metal ion at the designed site, difference in the identity of metal ions (CoII rather than MnII) and other interactions in the second coordination sphere. These results indicate that the metal ion, the ligands, and the environment around the metal-binding site play important roles in tuning the structure and function of metalloenzymes.

Introduction Metal ions have been shown to expand and enrich the functions of proteins [1­4]. Design and engineering of metalloproteins is an effective means to test the biochemical principles obtained from studies of native proteins and their variants, and may reveal new insights [5­8]. A primary example is the manganesebinding site in manganese peroxidase (MnP) from the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (PC)

(Fig. 1a) [9, 10]. Oxidation of MnII to MnIII is a critical step in the biodegradation of lignin, a phenylpropanoid polymer comprising approximately 25% of woody plant cell walls [11­13]. Since lignin is the second most abundant natural polymer (next to cellulose) and the most abundant renewable aromatic material in the biosphere, its degradation plays a key role in the earth's carbon cycle, and is recognized as a potential means to obtain useful industrial chemicals [11­13]. The MnP-containing white rot fungus PC is also efficient in degradation of a number of persistent environmental pollutants. Toward the goal of understanding the Mn-binding site in MnP, a number of biochemical and biophysical studies of MnP have been carried out [11­13]. These studies have established that MnII is coordinated by four carboxylate groups (from Glu35, Glu39, Asp179, and one of the propionate groups of the heme cofactor) and two water molecules in an octahedral geometry [9, 10]. Like other peroxidases, MnP reacts with H2O2 to generate compounds I and II [14]. Unlike other peroxidases, however, compounds I and II can oxidize MnII to MnIII, which then diffuses away with the help of dicarboxylic acid chelators such as oxalate and malonate to degrade lignin or other aromatic pollutants oxidatively [11­13]. Despite this progress, the role of each of the ligands to the Mn ion in maintaining the structure and promoting MnP activity remains to be fully understood. Site-directed mutagenesis, a technique widely used on other proteins, has only begun to shed light onto the roles of the ligands, owing to difficulty in expressing a fungal protein in genetically manageable hosts such as Escherichia coli [15­19]. Complementary to the ``top-down'' approach of biochemical and biophysical studies of native proteins,

which can uncover necessary features for the metalbinding site, protein design and engineering is a ``bottom-up'' approach that can show if those necessary features are enough to form a functional metalbinding site [5­8]. In searching for the missing link, protein design can often reveal new features that may be overlooked in native protein studies. Since the new metal-binding site is designed into a protein that is usually easy and cost-effective to produce, the designed protein may be amenable to practical applications. Application of this principle has allowed a similar Mnbinding site to that in MnP to be designed into other heme proteins such as cytochrome c peroxidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CcP) [20­24], lignin peroxidase [25], and myoglobin [26]. Our work on designing a Mn-binding site in CcP has been inspired by structural studies of MnP in comparison with CcP [9, 10]. Both MnP and CcP are heme peroxidases with a similar overall scaffold, despite poor (less than 15%) sequence homology. The heme active sites, including the position of proximal and distal histidines, are also similar; even the residues that form hydrogen bonds to these histidines are conserved between the two enzymes. The major differences between the two enzymes are the absence of the Mn-binding site in CcP, and the presence of tryptophan in the distal and proximal sites of the heme in CcP rather than phenylalanine in MnP. CcP is an ideal template for engineering the Mn binding, as its expression, purification, and characterization (including both spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic studies) have been well established [24, 27­33]. The reactive intermediates of CcP and MnP are also similar [24]. When MnP reacts with peroxide it forms a classic compound I like most peroxidases, which consists of an FeIV-oxo species and a porphyrin cation radical. Compound I can perform a one-electron oxidation of substrate (MnII), forming compound II (ferryl heme), which consists of an FeIV-oxo species. Compound II can then react with a second molecule of substrate, returning the enzyme to the FeIII resting sate. CcP on the other hand forms a similar intermediate called compound I¢, which consists of an FeIV-oxo species and a protein radical located on Trp191. Compound I¢ can also perform a one-electron oxidation of substrate [cytochrome c for the native wild-type yeast CcP (WTCcP) or MnII for CcP with an engineered Mn-binding site]. To design a similar Mn-binding site in CcP, a sequence alignment was carried out to identify three homologous residues (Gly41, Val45, and His181) in CcP that occupy similar positions as the three amino acid carboxylate ligands to the Mn ion in MnP (Fig. 1a)

[20]. Mutation of the three residues in CcP to the corresponding residues in MnP [CcP(G41E, V45E, H181D)] resulted in a new CcP variant called MnCcP that binds a single MnII ion at a similar location on the basis of evidence from electronic absorption and paramagnetically shifted proton NMR spectroscopic techniques [20, 22]. The MnCcP variant also exhibits higher MnII oxidation activity [20], especially when two of the tryptophan residues in CcP were replaced with corresponding phenylalanine as in MnP [23]. Wilcox et al.[21] have independently designed a Mn-binding site in CcP, with a similar MnII oxidation activity, by mutation of a slightly different set of residues, such as [CcP(D37E, P44D, V45D)]. The results presented so far suggest that a Mn-binding site can be designed into a metalloprotein with a similar function without using identical ligand sets. A careful kinetic and structural study is then required to offer deeper insight into the design process, as it allows better design of not only MnP, but also other metalloproteins in general. We therefore present here kinetic and X-ray crystallographic studies of a redesigned Mn-binding site in CcP with a new ligand set based on evaluation of the previous design strategies.

Materials and methods Materials Oligonucleotide primers (50-nmol scale--high performance liquid chromatography purified) were ordered from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). Native Pfu polymerase and DpnI restriction endonuclease were purchased from Stratagene (San Diego, CA). All chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and were used without further purification. Hydrogen peroxide concentration was determined by UV absorption at 240 nm [34]. Site-directed mutagenesis Primers for site-directed mutagenesis were designed with the aid of the Wisconsin GCG package version 9.1 (Madison, WI). The mutations to engineer MnCcP.1 [CcP(MI, D37E, V45E, H181E)] were introduced into recombinant yeast CcP containing Met-Ile at the N-terminus in addition to the normal WTCcP sequence[CcP(MI)] using the Stratagene QuickChange mutagenesis method. Resulting mutants were screened by restriction digests and the sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Protein expression and purification Protein expression and purification were carried out as described previously [20, 23, 35]. Trace metal ion contaminants were removed by dialysis against three changes of 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7) containing 1 mM EDTA, three changes of Chelex-treated 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7), 100 mM KCl, and three changes of Chelex-treated 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7). The purity and molecular weight of the protein was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Concentrations were determined from the pyridine hemochromogen method [36, 37]. Electronic absorption (UV­vis) studies UV­vis spectra were obtained using a Hewlett-Packard 8453 spectrophotometer. The samples were in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH values indicated in the text or in figure legends. Electron paramagnetic resonance study The X-band (9-GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiment for MnCcP was carried out as previously described [33]. EPR spectra were recorded using a Varian-122 X-band spectrometer equipped with an Air Products Helitran cryostat and temperature controller. Samples were prepared by exchanging concentrated stock protein solution into 50 mM sodium malonate pH 5.0 by gel filtration (PD-10) column. One equivalent hydrogen peroxide was added to the sample (0.8 mM) containing 20% glycerol in a prechilled EPR tube at 277 K. After mixing, the sample was rapidly frozen with liquid nitrogen. The spectrum was recorded at 15 K with a microwave power of 2 mW and a frequency of 9.057 GHz. MnII oxidation assay The oxidation of MnII was monitored following the increase in absorption at 270 nm due to the formation of a MnIII malonate complex [38­40], using an HP 8453 diode-array spectrophotometer equipped with a PolyScience water bath. All kinetic assays were performed at 298 K. An extinction coefficient of 11.9 mM­1 cm­1 was used in the calculations. Typical assays for determination of the apparent Michaelis­ Menton parameters for MnII contained 0.6 lM

enzyme and 0.8­27 mM MnII in 50 or 500 mM malonate buffer at pH 5, and the reactions were initiated by addition of hydrogen peroxide to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. Lineweaver­Burke plots were constructed using the initial linear portion of the kinetic traces. The data presented are the average of at least three measurements, and error bars are shown in the corresponding figures. Kinetic constants are listed in Table 1. Inhibition studies MnII oxidation reactions were carried out as described in the presence of 17.1 and 42.75 mM CoCl2. Control reactions were performed either without MnII or the enzyme in the reaction mixture. The inhibition constant (KI) for CoII was calculated from the Lineweaver­Burke plots of the initial rates plotted against MnII concentration. Inhibition assays were also carried out for CaII, MgII, CoII, NiII, and ZnII using 13 mM MnII with a 43 mM competing metal ions. The same concentrations of peroxide, enzyme, and malonate buffer were used as above. pH dependence studies The pH dependence of MnII oxidation by MnCcP.1 was assayed in 500 mM malonate buffer. The solution was adjusted to the final pH by mixing malonic acid and dibasic malonate. Assays were done as described already using 13.2 mM MnSO4. Crystallization of MnCcP.1 The protein sample was exchanged into 100 mM 3(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid buffer (pH 7.0) and concentrated using Centricon concentrators (10,000 molecular weight cutoff). Crystallization of protein samples was performed using the vapor diffusion hanging drop technique. The protein solution (45 mg ml­1) was placed on siliconized glass and was allowed to equilibrate with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 0.01 M CoCl2 and 1.0 M hexanediol in 0.1 M sodium acetate trihydrate (pH 4.6). No CoCl2 was used for the metal-free form. All other conditions were the same in these experiments. Crystals of both forms for suitable X-ray analysis began to appear at 1 week and finished growth after 1­3 weeks with a size of 0.4 mm · 0.3 mm · 0.2 mm. Crystals for the metal-free binding site were later cryosoaked in 50 mM MnII solution in an attempt to obtain the MnIIcontaining protein structure.

Data collection To collect the diffraction data, the crystals were first soaked in cryoprotectant (35% glycerin in sodium acetate trihydrate pH 4.6) briefly and were frozen in liquid nitrogen quickly. To confirm the quality of the crystals, they were analyzed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign using X-ray diffraction with a Bruker general area detector diffraction system, equipped with a four-circle diffractometer, a HiStar multiwire area detector, a graphite monochromator, and a rotating-anode target. The diffraction data sets summarized in Table 2 were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source PXrr beam lines X12C and X29 (Upton, NY) and were processed with HKL2000 software [41]. Structure determination The crystal structures were solved by the molecular replacement method, AmoRe [42], using the coordinates of CcP (PDB code, 1BES) as the search model. Rigid-body refinement was applied to the model obtained using AmoRe. The crystal structure was further

refined using Shelxl-97 [43]. The model was rebuilt for residues (D37E, V45E, and H181E) by the program O [44]. Three glutamic acid residues (at positions 37, 45, and 181) were located from the omit map. The structure was finally refined using XPLOR [45] in the res° olution range 10.0­1.48 A with a final Rwork/Rfree of 0.208/0.243 (Table 2) for no metal ion form, and Rwork/ Rfree of 0.223/0.257 (Table 2) for the metal-bound form ° in the resolution range 10.0­1.60 A. Solvent molecules were added according to peaks in the 2Fo ­ Fc map with 1.0r cutoff. The structure has been checked by Procheck [46] and all residues occupy allowed regions.

Results and discussion Redesign of a MnII-binding site in CcP Our first-generation design of a MnII-binding site in CcP (MnCcP) was based primarily on sequence homology between CcP and MnP [20]. In an attempt to improve the design, and to learn principles of metalloprotein design from the design and characterization process, we carried out a closer comparison of the

new design includes D37E, V45E, H181E mutations and is called MnCcP.1. UV­vis and EPR characterization and reaction with hydrogen peroxide The UV­vis spectrum of MnCcP.1 at pH 4.5 displays a Soret band at 409 nm and visible bands at 505 and 545 nm with a charge transfer band at 638 nm (Fig. 2a); it is indicative of a six-coordinated high-spin heme-Fe species, as in MnCcP [20, 23] and other variants investigated in our laboratory [35]. Both fiveand six- coordinated high-spin hemes were found in MnP [15]. Upon addition of 1 equiv of hydrogen peroxide, the Soret band is shifted to 417 nm and the visible bands are at 532 and 560 nm, characteristic of a ferryl heme as observed in WTCcP and MnCcP [15, 23].

X-ray crystal structures for CcP (2CYP) [47], MnP (1MNP) [9], and a MnII-binding CcP mutant (1BVA) obtained by Wilcox et al. [21]. Most noticeable in the analysis is that the Gly41 residue side chain (H) selected in the original MnCcP model shown in Fig. 1 [20] is oriented away from the location of the manganese site. Mutation of Gly41 to a residue intended to bind MnII, such as glutamic acid, will likely result in the side chain pointing away from the binding site. In order for G41E to bind manganese, a significant rotation and reorganization of the protein backbone may be required; therefore Gly41 was left intact in the new design. The side chain of Asp37, on the other hand, is close to and faces into the MnII site and would likely serve as a ligand (Fig. 1). To bring the carboxylate ligand closer towards the Mn-binding site, we decided to mutate Asp37 to glutamic acid, which has a longer side chain. For the same reason, His181 can be changed to glutamic acid instead of aspartic acid. Therefore the

The EPR spectrum obtained upon mixing with 1 equiv of H2O2 has gi of 2.033 and g^ of 2.003 (Fig. 2b). The spectrum closely resembles that of the Trp191 radical signal in WTCcP [48]. On the basis if UV­vis and EPR data, we conclude that MnCcP.1 forms ferryl species with a tryptophan radical in the reaction with H2O2 in a manner similar to WTCcP and MnCcP. This differs from MnP, which forms a porphyrin radical compound I. Although the potential exists that this species may be slower in transferring electrons to the Mn site, mutation of Trp191 to phenylalanine in our original MnCcP [MnCcP(W191F)] actually resulted in a slight decrease in kcat/KM ([23]). The W51F/W191F double mutant resulted in a sixfold increase in kcat/KM ([23]). These mutations are thus not expected to have a large impact on the D37E/V45E/H181E mutant either and this is why we focused our effort on the MnII binding ligands in this work. Mn oxidation assay The initial rates of Mn oxidation at pH 5.0 were obtained by monitoring the absorbance at 270 nm. Kinetic constants (kcat, KM) were obtained from Lineweaver­Burke plots (Fig. 3). The kcat for MnCcP.1 oxidation of MnII was 0.47 s­1, similar to that of the first-generation designed MnCcP (0.42 s­1) [23]. Importantly, the KM of MnCcP.1 was 1.9 mM, stronger than the 4.1 mM in the original MnCcP [23], suggesting the new design improves mainly KM, not kcat. The overall effect of these mutations was a 2.5-fold increase in catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) over the original

MnCcP. The kcat and KM values are similar to those of MnP variants with mutations to one of the Mn-binding ligands (Table 1). This could indicate that perhaps not all of the engineered ligands in MnCcP.1 are at the optimal positions to bind to MnII. Effects of metal ions on MnII oxidation activity The effect of CoII ion on MnII oxidation activity was investigated. The Lineweaver­Burke plots of activity (v) versus substrate concentration showed increasing slopes with increasing cobalt concentrations (Fig. 3). The y intercept (1/vmax) remained essentially unchanged, indicating that CoII acts as a competitive inhibitor. The calculated KI for CoII was 35 ± 5 mM. CoII has been shown to be a competitive inhibitor for MnP [49, 50]. Therefore the designed MnCcP.1 reproduces similar behavior as in MnP. The effects of other metals were also studied (Fig. 4). Calcium did not inhibit the reaction, whereas ZnII showed the greatest inhibition at 37 ± 2% of the activity without inhibitor, and the activity in the presence of CoII was 68 ± 2%. Intermediate inhibitions were observed for other divalent metal ions investigated (75 ± 4% for MgII and 61 ± 9% for NiII). In native MnP, neither CaII nor MgII inhibits MnII oxidation by MnP [50]. Whereas CaII does not inhibit MnII oxidation in the designed MnCcP.1, MgII is inhibitive, albeit to the least extent among the metal ions investigated. These results indicate that although the designed MnCcP.1 can reproduce most of the properties of native MnP in terms of metal ion inhibition, some differences remain.

The activity increased linearly with increasing pH by 2.9fold from pH 4.5 to 6. At this point the activity leveled off, showing only a slight increase to 3.1-fold at pH 7. This pH profile is similar to that of the original MnCcP (data not shown), showing an increase in activity with increasing pH from pH 4.5 to 6. This is consistent with the pH dependence of the bimolecular reaction of WTCcP with H2O2 over this pH range [51­53]. This pH profile, however, contradicts that of MnP [54] and CcP(G41E, V45E, W51F, H181D, W191F), called MnCcP2 [23], which show higher activity at lower pH, attributable to a pH-dependent increase in redox potential. X-ray crystal structure of metal-free MnCcP.1 The X-ray crystal structure of MnCcP.1 was solved at ° 1.48-A resolution without a metal in the engineered Mn-binding site (and with the heme present) (Fig. 6, Table 2). In this structure, the three engineered MnIIbinding ligands at positions 37, 45, and 181 are pointing inwards, forming a site into which MnII could bind, confirming the design principle discussed earlier. More importantly, the structure of metal-free MnCcP.1 is very similar to that of metal-free MnP [10], which also has its ligands pointing inwards towards the site. The major difference is that four water molecules are found in the metal-free site in MnCcP.1 compared with three in the metal-free MnP site. Conceivably one or more of X-ray crystal structure of MnCcP.1 with CoII bound at the designed MnII site The X-ray crystal structure of MnCcP.1 was solved to ° 1.60-A resolution with a cobalt bound in the engineered Mn-binding site (Fig. 7a , Table 2). Repeated attempts to grow crystals under identical conditions with manganese or cobalt yielded numerous crystals grown in the presence of cobalt but none for manganese. The crystal structure shows that the cobalt interacts with D37E, V45E, H181E, a heme propionate group, and three water molecules, confirming general features of the metal-binding site design. The temperature factor for the density assigned to CoII is 50.63 with an occupancy of 1, whereas at an occupancy of 0.5, it is 32.43. The temperature factors for the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group in D37E are 53.40 and 35.38, 18.61 and 21.80 for V45E, 28.45 and 31.69 for H181E, respectively. These results suggest a partial occupancy of CoII at the designed site. The Fo ­ Fc difference electron density map contoured at the 4.0r level also indicates the presence of a metal in the site (Fig. S3). The Co peak is still visible on the Fo ­ Fc difference map contoured at the 4r level, but disappears at the 8r level, also indicating a partial occupancy of Co. Comparison of MnCcP.1 and WTCcP structures Superposition of the structures of MnCcP.1 with that of WTCcP (2CYP) [47] revealed that the backbone positions of MnCcP.1 in both the metal-free and metalbound forms overlay nicely with those of WTCcP

° Tyr36 is shifted 0.80 A in the metal-free form in comparison with the WTCcP structure, most likely owing to the increased steric bulk introduced by the engineered ligands. The Tyr36 phenolic oxygen is ° shifted even further away to 1.00 A in the CoII-bound form. Comparison of MnCcP.1 and MnP The metal ion in the engineered metal binding site of MnCcP.1 overlays nicely with MnII bound in MnP (1MNP) [9, 10], and their center-to-center position ° differs by approximately 0.74 A (Fig. 7b, c). A major difference observed between the MnCcP.1 and MnP structures arises in the distances of the ligands to the metal (Table 3). The distances to the MnII in MnP for ° Glu35, Glu39, and Asp181 are 2.41, 2.07, and 2.40 A, respectively, indicating that these ligands are directly coordinated to the metal ion. The distances to the CoII in MnCcP.1 for engineered Glu37, Glu45, and Glu181, ° ° on the other hand, are 2.90 A, 3.95, and 3.96 A, respectively. It appears that three structural water ° molecules are 2.12­2.44 A from the metal (Figs. 7, 8). ° The engineered ligand V45E is 2.55 A from Wat1, ° from Wat2. In addition, Wat3 whereas D37E is 2.34 A ° is closer to the second heme propionate at 2.91 A than ° . These results indicate that either the H181E at 3.93 A metal is occupying the site as an aquo complex stabilized by electrostatic interaction with the designed ligands in a second shell or the metal ion occupies the site only partially, and the structure is the average of metal-bound and metal-free structures. The temperature factors and Fo ­ Fc difference map are consistent with the site being occupied only partially. It is interesting to note that, despite the fact that the backbone positions of the ligands are similar for MnCcP.1 and MnP, the metal­ligand distances are quite different. Partial occupancy of a metal ion in the site in MnCcP.1 may contribute to this difference. In addition, other factors, such as the identity of the metal ion and residues in the secondary coordination sphere, may play important roles for metal binding at the designed site. The ionic radius of a high-spin CoII with a ° coordination number of 6 (0.745 A) is generally smalII ler than that of a high-spin Mn with the same coor° dination number (0.83 A) [56], and the metal ions often have different preferences for ligand donor set and geometry. In addition, MnII typically also has ° longer metal­oxygen bond lengths (2.181 A for Mn II ° for CoII hexaquo) [57]. hexaquo) versus Co (2.086 A Therefore, these differences may result in different binding modes for the two metals. In addition, it has been observed that Glu39 of MnP adopts two

(Fig. S2), suggesting that mutations in the designed protein did not perturb the structure significantly. Trp191 of MnCcP.1 overlays almost exactly with that of WTCcP and is surrounded by Met230 and Met231 which have been implicated in the stabilization of the tryptophyl radical [48, 55]. The major difference is the new density due to the engineered metal binding ligands (Fig. 6). In addition, Tyr36 is shifted out of the pocket in metal-free MnCcP.1; the phenolic oxygen of

conformations with CdII bound [50]. The carboxylate groups are rotated approximately 90°, resulting in a ° 0.08-A difference in ligand-to-metal distance. These results suggest that MnII may not bind to MnCcP.1 in an identical manner to CoII; the larger ionic radius of MnII and the longer Mn­O bond length may poten-

tially allow MnII to bind to some of the ligands in a similar manner as in MnP. The difference between CoII and MnII may not in itself account for different metal­ligand interactions between redesigned MnCcP.1 and native MnP. Most likely the environment around the metal and the ligand, i.e., secondary coordination sphere, may play a critical role. For example, the contribution of H181E to cobalt binding is the weakest among the ligands introduced. One reason is that the carboxylate group of Glu181 is sandwiched between the amino groups of two lysine residues (Lys179 and Lys183), with one ° Glu181 carboxylate oxygen 3.28 A from Lys179, while ° from Lys183. These salt bridges the other is 3.71 A may have prevented Glu181 from approaching the metal site to form a stronger bond. In the case of MnP, on the other hand, Arg177 forms a favorable salt bridge with Glu35. When this residue is mutated, KM is even weaker than in the redesigned variant described here and kcat is also adversely affected [18]. The weak interaction between the metal ion and its surrounding ligands shown in MnCcP.1 is also known in other metalloproteins. For example, a crystallo-

graphic study of a divalent metal ion transporter CorA showed that the distance between a bound cobalt and the surrounding potential protein ligands is greater ° than 3.5 A [58]. These structural differences have direct implications for catalysis. A weaker KM is observed for MnCcP.1 than for MnP, since, with possible exception of D37E, the ligand interaction with metal ion in MnCcP.1 is weak. For example, the distance of the heme propio° nate to the metal is shorter in MnP at 2.15 A compared ° with 3.22 A in MnCcP.1. If one assumes MnII is bound in an identical manner to the CoII in MnCcP.1, this ° 1.07-A difference should allow electron transfer to be much faster in MnP. A lack of binding by residue 181 may be another cause of low activity in MnCcP and MnCcP.1. In the MnP case, it has been shown that the mutation of Asp179, a residue corresponding to Glu181, to asparagine resulted in a 300-fold decrease in kcat for MnII oxidation. This ligand is therefore vitally important and may be the main source of low activity. Any future redesign of the site should include mutation of these lysine residues to allow stronger coordination by H181E. Comparison of MnCcP.1 with another CcP model For comparison, the structure of MnCcP.1 was overlaid with that of the CcP(D37E, P44D, V45D), called MP6.8, CcP model of MnP (1BVA) characterized by Wilcox et al. [21] (Fig. 9). The location of metal ion binding is different in the two CcP MnII binding sites.

° Whereas the center-to-center position differs by 0.74 A between the bound metal ions of MnCcP.1 and MnP, ° the difference is 1.98 A between bound metal ions of MP6.8 and MnP. The MnII in MP6.8 is, however, ° ° ° 2.85 A from V45D, 4.95 A from P44D, and 2.30 A from the heme propionate group. Its kcat is on the same order of magnitude as that of MnCcP.1. This is not surprising since the MP6.8 site also lacks the equivalent of Asp179 found in MnP, which was proven to be vital for optimal activity [15]. The third amino acid ligand (D37E) in this design was flipped out of the active site as an unforeseen result of mutating Pro44 to glutamic acid. The new MnCcP.1 model thus represents the closest model of the MnP Mn-binding site in terms of metal ion positioning for which a crystal structure exists. Summary and conclusions A new MnII-binding site has been designed into CcP on the basis of a structural comparison of CcP and MnP. The designed protein, MnCcP.1, has 2.5-fold higher catalytic efficiency (due to a stronger KM) than a previous designed MnII-binding site in CcP (MnCcP) on the basis of sequence homology. The crystal structures of MnCcP.1 obtained with the metal-free form and with a cobalt bound at the designed MnII-binding site indicate that MnCcP.1 is the closest structural model to MnP in terms of metal ion superposition and ligand backbone positions and orientation. Despite these similarities, CoII is mostly likely partially bound to the site and thus has much weaker interactions with ligands than MnII­ligand interactions in MnP, and could contribute to the lower activity in MnCcP.1. Although differences in ionic radii and other coordination properties of CoII and MnII may be important, other factors such as a secondary coordination sphere including steric conflict by the ligands introduced with residues around the Mn-binding site, and salt bridges may also matter. Understanding of these subtle differences will help further improve the design of MnIIbinding sites.
