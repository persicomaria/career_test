Summary

April

23,1975

Aspartate aminotransferase from pig heart cytosol consists of 2 identical protomers. Carboxymethylation of the easily accessible cysteines 45 and 82 of the holoenzyme produces a modified protein which however is still fully active. If the apoenzyme obtained from the carboxymethylated holoenzyme is subjected to the thiol specific reagent DTNB, another group per protomer can be titrated. There is some evidence that the group modified is the thiol 390 which is titrated in "syncatalytic" conditions, i.e. 2 mM ketoglutarate and 70 mM glutamate. The full reactivation of the carboxymethylated apoenzyme is obtained on binding of one PLP at each active site of the dimer. During the reactivation the number of thiols 390 accessible to DTNB decreases from 2 to 0 when PLP is added. The variation of the number of reactive thiol residues is not linear with coenzyme binding. Apo-holoenzyme carboxymethylated hybrid does not react with DTNB. Thus, a strong interaction between the 2 protomers is demons trated.
