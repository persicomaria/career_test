The shikimate pathway, responsible for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds, is essential for the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is a potential target for the design of new anti-tuberculosis drugs. The first step of this pathway is catalyzed by 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7phosphate synthase (DAH7PS). The DAH7PSs have been classified into two apparently unrelated types and, whereas structural data have been obtained for the type I DAH7PSs, no structural information is available for their type II counterparts. The type II DAH7PS from M. tuberculosis has been expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, functionally characterized and crystallized. It is found to be metal ion-dependent and subject to feedback inhibition by phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine and chorismate, with a significant synergistic effect when tryptophan is used in combination with phenylalanine. The crystal structure of M. tuberculosis DAH7PS has been determined by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction and refined at ° 2.3 A in complex with substrate phosphoenolpyruvate and Mn2C. The structure reveals a tightly associated dimer of (b/a)8 TIM barrels. The monomer fold, the arrangement of key residues in the active site, and the binding modes of PEP and Mn2C, all match those of the type I enzymes, and indicate a common ancestry for the type I and type II DAH7PSs, despite their minimal sequence identity. In contrast, the structural elements that decorate the core (b/a)8 fold differ from those in the type I enzymes, consistent with their different regulatory and oligomeric properties.

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is an ancient disease but remains one of the most serious health threats facing mankind. Worldwide deaths total 2­3 million annually,1 more than for any other infectious disease, and it is estimated that approximately one-third of the world's population is infected. Although effective anti-TB drugs exist, the long treatment times required, the problems of latent or persistent TB,2 and the proliferation of multidrugresistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent,3 have all created an urgent need for the development of new antimycobacterial agents. This is one of the most important of current challenges for drug discovery.

928 The shikimate pathway comprises a series of seven enzyme-catalyzed reactions that result in the biosynthesis of chorismate, which is the precursor for many essential aromatic compounds.4 These include the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine; folic acid, an essential cofactor for many enzymatic processes; and salicylate, used for the biosynthesis of the siderophores through which bacteria acquire iron.5 The shikimate pathway is found in microorganisms and plants, and was discovered recently in the apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium falciparum, Toxoplasma gondii, and Cryptosporidium parvum.6,7 However, the pathway is absent from higher organisms, making the enzymes of this pathway attractive as targets for the development of antibiotics and herbicides. The active ingredient of the herbicide Roundupw, glyphosate [N-(phosphomethyl)glycine], which inhibits the sixth enzyme of the shikimate pathway, 8 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase, has been shown to inhibit the growth of apicomplexan parasites in vitro.6 Recent gene disruption studies have shown that operation of the shikimate pathway is essential for the viability of M. tuberculosis,9 validating the choice of enzymes from this pathway as targets for the development of novel antimycobacterial agents. The first committed step in the shikimate pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme 3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS, EC 2.5.1.54). This enzyme catalyzes an aldol-like condensation reaction between phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and D-erythrose 4-phosphate (E4P) to generate 3-deoxy- D -arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAH7P) and inorganic phosphate. DAH7PSs have been classified into two, apparently unrelated, types.10 Type I DAH7PSs are smaller than their type II counterparts, with molecular masses less than 40 kDa, and can be further divided into two sequence subfamilies, Ia and Ib.11,12 The type Ia and Ib DAH7PSs have been well characterized, structurally and functionally. They share a divalent metal ion dependence and susceptibility to feedback inhibition, and crystal structures of the type Ia enzymes from Escherichia coli13­15 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 16,17 and the type Ib enzymes from Thermotoga maritima18 and Pyrococcus furiosus,19 reveal a common (b/a)8 TIM barrel fold. Analysis of the genome of M. tuberculosis reveals the presence of a single open reading frame (Rv2178c) encoding a putative DAH7PS of 462 residues.20 This belongs to the type II DAH7PS family, a separate homologous group of enzymes, distinct in size (w50 kDa) and sequence from the type I enzymes.11,21 Type II enzymes were first identified in plants,22,23 and subsequently a limited number of microbial examples were characterized.10 As more microbial genomes have been sequenced, however, the number of type II DAH7PSs known has grown rapidly, and it appears that this type of DAH7PS consists of a subset of plant enzymes clustered within a more divergent set of microbial enzymes.21 In some organisms,

genes encoding both type I and type II DAH7PSs have been identified, with several of the type II enzymes apparently being required for the biosynthesis of specific secondary metabolites.24,25 However, the presence of only type II DAH7PSs in the predicted proteomes of a number of species including Streptomyces sp., Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Campylobacter jejuni, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Novosphingobium aromaticivorans, Helicobacter pylori and several Mycobacteria species provides evidence for a role of type II DAH7PSs in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Sequence identity between the type I and type II DAH7PSs is less than 10%, raising the possibility that they represent distinct protein families, unrelated by evolution. The third enzyme of the shikimate pathway, dehydroquinase, an enzyme that functions also in quinic acid metabolism, is similarly found in two distinct protein families. The two enzyme types exhibit altered catalytic mechanism and are distinctly different in structure, indicating that despite common overall reaction chemistry, the two groups arose via convergent evolution.26,27 Recent biochemical characterization of the type II enzyme from H. pylori has indicated many key mechanistic features that are shared between type I and type II DAH7PSs,28 but no three-dimensional structural information is available for any type II enzyme. However, the presence of type II DAH7PSs in a number of important pathogenic bacteria makes them prime targets for study. DAH7PS is a key drug target in its own right, given its crucial role in the biosynthesis of many key aromatic molecules, and the exploitation of differences between the two types of DAH7PS may enable the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Here, we report the functional characterization and three-dimensional structure of the type II DAH7PS from M. tuberculosis (Mt-DAH7PS). The crystal structure reveals a striking correspondence of both fold and function in the two types of DAH7PS, despite the minimal sequence identity, with a common catalytic apparatus on a shared (b/a)8 TIM barrel fold. Importantly, however, distinct decorations of the basic fold and modes of oligomerization suggest different regulation of the two types and illuminate the divergent evolutionary relationships between these two families.

Results
Expression and functional characterization The expression of Mt-DAH7PS in E. coli gave rise to insoluble protein, and no enzymic activity was detected in the supernatant following cell lysis and centrifugation. On the basis of our recent observation that H. pylori type II DAH7P synthase is a substrate for E. coli chaperonins, we coexpressed GroEL/GroES and Mt-DAH7PS, obtaining soluble (and active) recombinant protein.28 Size-exclusion

929 molecules. In the final model, molecule A comprises the complete polypeptide chain (residues 1­462) except for residues 419­431, which are assumed to be disordered, and molecule B is similarly complete except for residues 376­378 and 422­431. Two additional residues (Gly-Ala) from the linker to the cleaved His-tag are also modeled for both molecules. The main-chain torsion angles correspond well with allowed values, with 90.1% of residues in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot, as defined by PROCHECK,29 and no outlier. The final model also contains two manganese ions, two PEP molecules, two sulfate ions, a molecule of the detergent Thesit (polyethyleneglycol dodecyl ether) and 342 water molecules. The Mt-DAH7PS monomer Both Mt-DAH7PS molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal have the same fold, with 412 out of 462 residues matching with a root-mean-square ° (rms) difference in Ca atom positions of 0.42 A; only in the N-terminal 21 residues is there any significant deviation. The Mt-DAH7PS monomer (Figure 1(a)) consists of a core (b/a)8 TIM barrel domain in which the eight parallel b-strands (residues 80­85, 120­127, 243­249, 277­281, 302­307, 331­337, 361­366 and 406­412) are each followed by a-helices. Two major additions decorate the barrel. At the N terminus, an extended b-strand plays a key role in dimerization (see below) and is followed by three helices (a0a, a0b and a0c), the last of which (a0c, residues 60­78) closes off the N-terminal end of the barrel. The second addition consists of a pair of helices (a2a and a2b) that extend the a2­b3 connecting loop and pack against the outside of the barrel. The connecting loops at the C-terminal end of the barrel, where they help to form the active site (described below), are markedly longer than those at the N-terminal end (Figure 1(b)). The b2­a2 and b8­a8 loops are 37 and 32 residues long, respectively, the b7­a7 and b6­a6 loops are slightly shorter (16 and ten residues, respectively), and the other loops are four to eight residues long. In contrast, at the N-terminal end of the barrel, six of the eight connecting loops are short (two to seven residues), and only the a2­b3 connection, with its additional two helices, and the 19 residue a3­b4 connection, are longer.

chromatography gave a molecular mass of w100 kDa, consistent with a dimeric species. The apparent KM values for E4P and PEP were 25(G3) mM and 37(G3) mM respectively, and the kcat value was calculated as 3.1(G0.1) sK1. Reducing conditions, maintained with added tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), were required for full activity. The activity of Mt-DAH7PS was also sensitive to the presence of EDTA, although it took several hours to inactivate the enzyme completely. The activity of the apoenzyme could be restored by the inclusion of a variety of divalent metals in the activity assay (Table 1). Co2C and Cd2C, besides Mn2C, which is generally used to assay type I DAH7PSs, gave the fastest reaction rates. Chorismate and the three aromatic amino acids were tested as potential feedback inhibitors of Mt-DAH7PS (Table 2). The enzyme was inhibited by all three aromatic amino acids, and by chorismate, with Trp having the most significant inhibitory effect. Inhibition when Trp was added in combination with Phe was considerably greater than the additive effect of the amino acids alone, suggesting synergistic inhibition with this combination of aromatic amino acids. Crystal structure determination The crystal structure of selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted M. tuberculosis DAH7PS was solved using single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data collected at the peak of the Se ° absorption edge, and was refined at 2.3 A resolution to a final R factor of 0.188 (RfreeZ0.224). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two

The two subunits in the asymmetric unit of the crystal form a tightly associated dimer (Figure 1(c)), in accord with size-exclusion chromatography, which indicates that the biological unit in solution is also dimeric. The major contributors to the dimer interface are the extended N-terminal residues 1­13, parts of helix a0b and the a0b­a0c loop from the N-terminal addition, together with the long helix a2, residues 165­189. The N termini form linked arms, with the N-terminal arm from molecule A fitting between the body of molecule B and the

molecule B arm (and vice versa), and residues 3­9 from the two molecules forming an antiparallel b-ribbon. This association involving the N-terminal arms contributes about 40% of the total buried surface in the dimer. The other major contribution to dimerization comes from the two a2 helices, which cross in the interface (Figure 1(c)). Overall, a ° total of 3782 A2 of solvent-accessible surface is found to be buried by dimer formation (approxi° mately 1900 A2 per monomer, or 10% of the monomer surface), indicating a very stable dimer. The interface is 66% hydrophobic, but includes onesalt-bridge (Asp10 A.Arg171B) and hydrogen bonds involving the side-chains of Gln11, Asn181 and Arg184, in addition to the hydrogen bonding of the N-terminal arms. Active site As is typical for TIM-barrel enzymes, the active site of Mt-DAH7PS is located at the C-terminal end of the barrel, where it is clearly indicated by the presence of the bound metal ion cofactor, Mn2C, and PEP (Figure 2(a)), which are found in the same position in both subunits, at the bottom of a deep cavity. The active site residues are contributed by the C-terminal ends of the b-strands and the connecting loops between b-strands and a-helices.

The metal-binding site is formed by four protein ligands, Sg of Cys87 (from the b1­a1 loop), N32 of His369 (from the b7­a7 loop), O32 of Glu411 (from the end of strand b8) and Od2 of Asp441 (from the b8­a8 loop). Between them, these ligands fill four positions of what most closely approximates a trigonal bipyramidal metal coordination site; Cys87 and His369 are the axial ligands, with Glu411 and Asp441 in the equatorial trigonal plane, leaving one equatorial site available for the binding of the E4P substrate or water. No water ligand is apparent in the present structure, although we cannot rule out such a ligand at the present resolution and reduced metal occupancy. An intriguing feature of the metal site is the presence of Cys440 close to the metal ligand Cys87. A simple rotation about Cys440 Ca­Cb to another rotamer would allow formation of a disulfide bond with Cys87, precluding metal binding and explaining the need for a reducing agent to maintain full activity of the enzyme. The PEP-binding site is defined by a network of hydrogen bonds between the protein and the PEP phosphate and carboxylate groups, which use almost their full hydrogen bond potential. The phosphate group of PEP is hydrogen bonded by the peptide NH of Glu283 and Arg284 N h1 (both located on the b4­a4 loop), Lys 306 Nz

(a) Stereo view showing the interactions with the manganese ion (magenta sphere), the PEP substrate (yellow and orange stick model) and the sulfate ion (green) that marks the likely position of the phosphate group of the E4P substrate, which is expected to fill the space between here and the metal site. Water molecules are shown as small red spheres. Metal­ligand bonds are shown with thin black lines, and hydrogen bonds with broken lines. Key residues that contribute to metal, PEP or sulfate binding are labeled. Cys440 can form a disulfide bond with the metal ligand Cys87, explaining the inactivation of the enzyme under oxidizing conditions.

(b) Stereo view of the electron density for the PEP substrate, from a bias-removed "omit" map, contoured at 3s.

(from the end of strand b5), Arg337 N3 and Nh2 (from the b6­a6 loop) and two water molecules; each phosphate oxygen atom receives at least two hydrogen bonds. The PEP carboxylate group forms a doubly hydrogen bonded ion pair with Arg126 (from the end of strand b2), receiving hydrogen bonds from its Nh1 and Nh2 atoms, and is additionally hydrogen bonded to the 3-amino group of Lys306 and one water molecule. Each carboxylate oxygen atom thus receives two hydrogen bonds of extremely favorable geometry, indicating exquisite molecular recognition. The PEP electron density (Figure 2(b)) indicates a configuration in which the central C2 carbon atom is trigonal planar, but the carboxylate and enol groups are not coplanar, as a result of a twist of 30­408 about the C1­C2 bond. In this configuration, the side-chains of Trp280 and Glu248 are on either side of the PEP methylene carbon atom (C3), with the Trp280 indole NH poin° ° ting at C3, w3 A away, and Glu248 O32 also w3 A away (Figure 2(b)). There is evidence in electron density difference maps for the presence also of a minor, more planar, conformer, but both refinement and the "omit" electron density point to the conformation shown in Figure 2(b) as the major one. Also in the active site region, near its opening and ° w10 A further out from the PEP, is a bound SO2K. 4

This ion, which marks the likely position of the E4P phosphate group (see below), is in the same position in both molecules, bound to Arg135 N3, Arg284Nh2, Ser136 Og and the peptide NH of Ser136. Arg284 provides a bridge between the PEP and sulfate sites, being hydrogen bonded to both the PEP phosphate group and the sulfate ion. Comparison with type I DAH7PS enzymes Our experimentally determined structure for Mt-DAH7PS is a (b/a)8 TIM barrel, as is found also for the type I DAH7PSs,13­19 and the closely related 3-deoxy D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO8P) synthases.30,31 We therefore superimposed the Mt-DAH7PS structure onto that of the type Ia E. coli DAH7PS,14,15 to test the extent of structural similarity despite the lack of recognizable sequence identity. Superimposing first just the eight b-strands of the core (b/a)8 barrel, and then extending the structural alignment incrementally, ° with a maximum disagreement threshold of 3 A, we could match 171 residues with an rms difference in ° C a atom positions of 2.12 A. The matching structural elements comprised the eight b-strands, helices a2, a4, a5, part of a6, and a8, and extensive regions of the b­a connecting loops at

932 the C-terminal end of the barrel, and included 37 sequence identities. This superposition, and a similar comparison with the type Ib P. furiosus DAH7PS, gives the structure-based sequence alignment shown in Figure 3. Importantly, the alignment of the type II Mt-DAH7PS onto the type I enzymes, purely on the basis of its fold, also aligns all the active site

residues. The metal ligands (Cys87, His369, Glu411 and Asp441), the residues that interact with PEP and the SO2K (Arg126, Arg135, Ser136, Arg284, 4 Lys306 and Arg337), and other conserved residues around the active site (Pro134, Ile281 and Gly282), match the equivalent residues in the type I E. coli ° DAH7PS with an rms difference of only 1.03 A for 111 atoms. The bound metal ion, PEP and sulfate are

933 a key drug target, since the enzymes of the shikimate pathway, including DAH7PS, are essential for the viability of M. tuberculosis,5,33 and so are the enzymes of downstream pathways leading to the aromatic amino acids, folic acid and mycobactin.33 The amino acid sequence of Mt-DAH7PS classifies it as a type II DAH7PS. Type II DAH7PSs are found in both bacterial and eukaryotic phylogenetic domains, either in combination with type Ia enzymes or alone. Several of the microbial type II DAH7PSs have a predicted function in secondary metabolism, on the basis of genomic context,34,35 but in organisms such as M. tuberculosis, where the sole DAH7PS belongs to the type II family, a pivotal role in primary metabolism is implied. The type II DAH7PSs are, however, poorly characterized compared with the type I DAH7PSs. In particular, the lack of tertiary structural information for the type II enzymes, which have no obvious sequence homology with the type I DAH7PSs, has made it unclear whether they have any evolutionary relationship.11 Our biochemical assays confirm that the gene product of Rv2178c is indeed a functional DAH7PS enzyme. As in the case of all other DAH7PSs, its activity is dependent on the presence of a divalent metal ion, and is sensitive to treatment with metal ion chelators.36­39 As was observed for the type II DAH7PSs from H. pylori, X. campestris and S. caespitosus,21,28,40 the highest enzyme activities were observed when the enzyme was treated with Co2C. The kinetic parameters for Mt-DAH7PS are also similar to those observed for the recently characterized bacterial type II DAH7PSs from H. pylori and X. campestris.21,28 Its regulation appears very different from that of most other DAH7PS enzymes, however, in the synergistic effects shown by the aromatic amino acids, where the inhibition is greater in combination than individually. The basis of this effect needs to be pursued further, but it suggests the possibility of more than one regulatory site. The most striking finding from the present work is the clear evolutionary relationship between Mt-DAH7PS, the first type II DAH7PS to be structurally characterized, and the type Ia and type Ib enzymes. Crystal structures have been reported for type Ia DAH7PS enzymes from E. coli (Ec-DAH7PS)13­15,41 and S. cerevisiae (Sc-DAH7PS) 16,17, and for type Ib DAH7PS enzymes from T. maritima (Tm-DAH7PS)18 and P. furiosus (Pf-DAH7PS).19 All of these type I enzymes are homotetramers, with (b/a)8 TIMbarrel subunits containing four apparently independent active sites. Mt-DAH7PS has the same monomer fold and, although TIM-barrel enzymes are very common, it is significant that the only close matches in the Protein Data Bank are other DAH7PS enzymes and the related KDO8PSs. The key observation, however, is that when Mt-DAH7PS is superimposed onto the type I DAH7PSs on the basis of its core barrel structure, all of the active site

° also within w1 A of their positions in the E. coli enzyme, consistent with a common reaction chemistry and mechanism. The only significant active site differences in MtDAH7PS appear to be the presence of the aromatic ring of Trp280 adjacent to the PEP, and the altered PEP conformation at C2­C3. Whether the contacts made by the PEP methylene carbon atom (C3) with Glu248 and Trp280 are significant for the reaction mechanism we cannot say at present. However, Glu248 is invariant in all DAH7PSs, and Trp280 is conserved in all type II enzymes. Trp280 replaces a Gln residue in Pf-DAH7PS and Tm-DAH7PS and Ala in Ec-DAH7PS and Sc-DAH7PS, though a Tyr residue from a different part of the structure occupies part of this space in the latter two enzymes. One other active site difference is the presence of Lys380, which is contributed by an insertion in the Mt-DAH7PS sequence and has no counterpart in the type I enzymes. Lys380 is hydrogen bonded to the metal ligand Asp441 and ° is 4 A from the SO2K, in a position where it could 4 interact with E4P. As an independent test of structural homology, we searched all structures in the Protein Data Bank using the program SSM.32 This showed that the closest structural neighbors were the type Ia DAH7PS enzymes from E. coli and S. cerevisiae (which gave Z-scores of 6.3 and 6.1, respectively, with w260 Ca atoms matching Mt-DAH7PS with an ° rms difference of w2.8 A) and the 3-deoxy-D-mannooctulosonate 8-phosphate synthase (KDO8PS) from Aquifex aeolicus (Z-score 7.4 and 222 Ca atoms ° matching with an rms difference of 2.5 A). KDO8PS (EC 2.5.1.55) catalyzes an analogous reaction to DAH7PS involving the condensation of PEP with D -arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P), a key step in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in Gram-negative bacteria, and the KDO8PSs and DAH7PSs have been noted to be very closely related, structurally and functionally.

Discussion
The enzyme 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS) is essential for the viability of most organisms because of its key role in chorismate biosynthesis. Chorismate, in turn, is the precursor for a wide variety of essential aromatic compounds, some of them universally required, such as folic acid and the aromatic amino acids, and others restricted to particular species, such as phenazine and the salicylate-based siderophores. Several subtypes of DAH7PS are often found in a given organism, subject to different regulation and with different metabolic roles. M. tuberculosis, in contrast, has only a single open reading frame (Rv2178c) that corresponds to a DAH7PS. This gives it a critical role and makes it

934 residues match, both spatially and chemically. This congruence of both fold and catalytic apparatus makes it unequivocal that the type I and type II enzymes are related by divergent evolution from a common ancestor. While the Mt-DAH7PS structure shows that the type I and type II enzymes share a common fold and active site architecture, there are significant differences both in the additional structural elements that adorn the core (b/a)8 barrel and in quaternary structure. As shown in Figure 4, the type Ib P. furiosus enzyme (Pf-DAH7PS) is the most stripped-down DAH7PS, its monomer comprising just the core (b/a)8 barrel. All of the structures have a structural element (a-helix in Mt-DAH7PS, Ec-DAH7PS and Sc-DAH7PS, and a b-ribbon in Tm-DAH7PS and Pf-DAH7PS) that closes the N-terminal end of the barrel. Most importantly, however, all except the P. furiosus enzyme possess extra structural motifs (domains or subdomains) that are involved in allosteric regulation. The type Ib Tm-DAH7PS, which is very similar in basic structure to Pf-DAH7PS, has a ferredoxin-like

Structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DAH7PS

domain attached to the N terminus of the barrel.18 In contrast to Pf-DAH7PS, which is not inhibited allosterically,37 Tm-DAH7PS is sensitive to the aromatic amino acids Phe and Tyr,38 and this inhibition depends on the presence of this N-terminal domain.18 Organisms that have subfamily Ia DAH7PSs often possess more than one DAH7PS isozyme; in E. coli, three isozymes are found, each inhibited by a different aromatic amino acid, and in S. cerevisiae there are two isozymes that are inhibited differentially by Phe or Tyr. The structures of the Ia enzymes Ec-DAH7PS (Phesensitive) and Sc-DAH7PS (Tyr-sensitive) comprise the basic barrel with an N-terminal extension and an extended a5­b6 loop that forms an antiparallel b-ribbon (Figure 4). Mutational studies and structures of these enzymes in complex with their respective feedback inhibitors show that the binding pocket is formed by residues from these two extensions to the basic barrel.16,17,41 As shown in this study, the type II Mt-DAH7PS is inhibited by aromatic amino acids and, in contrast to what has been reported for the type I enzymes, is

935 additional a-helices of the a2­b3 loop (Figure 3).21 The variability in this region when it is present, and the lack of this region in type II DAH7PSs that may not need to be regulated allosterically in this way, are also consistent with a role of this region in the binding of allosteric inhibitors. Analysis of mutant Mt-DAH7PSs and Mt-DAH7PS-inhibitor complexes is underway to test this. A further difference between the various DAH7PS enzymes is in their quaternary structures (Figure 5). The type Ia and type Ib DAH7PSs are homotetrameric, but only one monomer­monomer interface is conserved between these two subfamilies. This common interface primarily involves helices a3, a4 and a5, and loops b2­a2, b3­a3, b4­a4 and b5­a5, and impacts on the positioning of the a2­b2 loop that provides part of the E4P binding site in the active site of the protein. The same interface is observed in the closely related KDO8PS enzymes.30,31 Despite this common dimer, the type Ia and Ib DAH7PSs form tetramers using completely different structural elements, meaning that while the dimers can be superimposed, the tetramers cannot (Figure 5). In contrast, Mt-DAH7PS forms only a dimer, both in solution and in the crystal structure, and its monomer­ monomer interface shows no commonality with any subunit interface found in any previously reported DAH7PS (or KDO8PS) structure.

inhibited most significantly by a combination of aromatic amino acids. Neither the ferredoxin-like domain of Tm-DAH7PS nor the a5­b6 extension of the type Ia enzymes exists in Mt-DAH7PS. Instead, the common barrel and catalytic machinery is adorned with a major extension at the N terminus, comprising a b-strand and two helices (a0a and a0b), and an insertion of two helices (a2a and a2b) into the a2­b3 connecting loop. These two features are quite separate in the Mt-DAH7PS structure, in contrast to the situation in Ec-DAH7PS (or Sc-DAH7PS), where the N-terminal region (from a neighboring subunit) and extended a5­b6 loop associate to form the single Phe (or Tyr) binding site. As inhibitory binding sites of type I enzymes are located outside the basic barrel, and the unregulated P. furiosus DAH7PS contains no extra barrel elements, it is tempting to speculate that the additions to the barrel in Mt-DAH7PS may provide two distinct inhibitory binding sites for aromatic amino acids giving rise to synergistic inhibition displayed with Trp and Phe. It has been noted that type II DAH7PS enzymes encoded within clusters responsible for phenazine pigment production or antibiotic synthesis have a significant deletion that can now be identified as the

Conclusions
These studies on the type II DAH7PS from M. tuberculosis reveal a remarkable similarity in fold and function between type I and type II enzymes. Despite their minimal sequence identity, and the significant differences in quaternary structure and extensions to the core (b/a)8 barrel, the key residues that interact with PEP and the divalent metal ion are completely conserved and positioned almost identically in the two DAH7PS types. Recent studies with the type II DAH7PS from H. pylori show that key mechanistic features such as reaction stereochemistry and kinetic mechanism are indeed shared between the two DAH7PS types,28 entirely consistent with the observation of a shared catalytic scaffold. The common active site architecture and chemistry, housed within a shared protein fold, suggest very strongly that, unlike the dehydroquinases, the type I and type II enzymes have arisen from a common DAH7PS ancestor, with the decorations on this basic fold providing for different regulation. The structural similarity in the active sites suggests that inhibitors designed for other DAH7PS enzymes could make useful lead compounds for the development of new anti-TB drugs. The presence of one or two key differences, notably the presence of Trp280 adjacent to the PEP site, further suggests that more specific inhibitors that are selective for type II DAH7PSs could be developed on the basis of the present structure.

Structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DAH7PS

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification The predicted opening reading frame encoding Mt-DAH7PS (Rv2178c) was amplified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR product was cloned into pProExHTa (Novagen) expression vector, yielding a protein containing an N-terminal tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease-cleavable His6 tag upstream of the predicted translation start site. For the production of soluble protein, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing the pGroESL plasmid.42 Purification involved Ni2C affinity chromatography, followed by cleavage of the His6 tag by incubation with TEV protease (22 8C for up to 15 h) and size-exclusion chromatography as described.43 All purification buffers contained 20 mM 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]propane (BTP) (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 200 mM PEP and 100 mM MnSO4. For production of selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein, the plasmid bearing Rv2178c was transformed into cells of the methionine auxotroph DL41 (DE3), which contained pGroESL. The transformed cells were grown in minimal medium (500 ml) with SeMet as the only methionine source.44 The SeMet-substituted protein was grown and purified using the protocol that was used for the native protein.43 Enzyme assays and kinetic measurements The assay system for DAH7PS was a modified form of the assay used by Schoner and Herrmann.45 The consumption of PEP was monitored at 232 nm (3 of 2.8!103 MK1 cmK1 at 30 8C) using a Varian Cary 1 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Measurements were made using 1 cm path-length quartz cuvettes. The reaction mixtures to determine the apparent steady-state kinetic constants for M. tuberculosis DAH7PS contained 9­245 mM E4P (Sigma), 100 mM MnSO4 (Sigma), and 7­360 mM PEP (Research Chemicals), in 50 mM BTP buffer (pH 7.5). Solutions of PEP and E4P were made in 50 mM BTP (pH 7.5) and then treated with Chelex (Bio-Rad) and the solution of MnSO4 was made with BTP buffer (pH 7.5) that had been pre-treated with Chelex. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.5 ml of purified M. tuberculosis DAH7PS (2.1 mg/ml). Initial reaction rates were determined by a least-squares fit of the initial rate data, and each measurement was recorded in duplicate. The presence of additional TCEP in the assay mixtures (in addition to the carry-over from the enzyme solution) made no measurable difference to the initial reaction rates. One unit of activity is defined as the loss of 1 mmol of PEP minK1 at 30 8C. Km and kcat values were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis­Menten equation using Enzfitter (Biosoft). Metal activation of M. tuberculosis DAH7PS For analysis of divalent metal activation of M. tuberculosis DAH7PS, the enzyme was treated with 250 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) for 24 h at 4 8C. The concentration of the EDTA was then reduced to 50 mM, by dilution with 20 mM BTP (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 200 mM PEP, 100 mM MnSO4, and concentrated by passage through a 10 kDa cutoff ultrafiltration device (Vivascience), prior to the assay. The activity was determined upon addition of metal salt. The reaction mixture contained 174 mM PEP, 178 mM E4P

and 200 mM metal salt in 50 mM BTP (pH 7.5), which had been pre-treated with Chelex. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.5 ml of enzyme solution (2.1 mg/ml). The metal salts were MnSO4 (Sigma), ZnSO4, MgCl2 (BDH), CdSO4, CoSO4, NiCl2, CuSO4 (May and Baker), CaCl2 (Prolab) and FeSO4 (BDH). Measurement of molecular mass Size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex-200w, Amersham) was used to determine the molecular mass of M. tuberculosis DAH7PS in solution by comparing elution volumes with those for molecular mass standards (Sigma). The molecular mass standards were cytochrome c (12.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa) and b-amylase (200 kDa). Then 10 mM BTP (pH 7.0) supplemented with 200 mM PEP, 100 mM MnSO4 and 1 mM dithiothreitol was used to elute both DAH7PS and the standards at a flow-rate of 0.4 ml minK1. The molecular mass was determined by plotting the logarithms of the known molecular masses of protein standards against their elution volumes. Feedback inhibition studies Solutions of L-phenylalanine (Sigma), L-tyrosine (Sigma) and L-tryptophan (Sigma) in water were added to standard assay reaction mixtures to give a final concentration of 200 mM in inhibitor studies. The assay solution contained 50 mM BTP buffer (pH 7.5), 79 mM PEP, 154 mM E4P and 100 mM MnSO4. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 3 ml of Mt-DAH7PS (2.1 mg/ml). Additional assays were performed using combinations of aromatic amino acid with 200 mM L -tryptophan plus 200 mM L-phenylalanine, 200 mM L-tryptophan and 200 mM L -tyrosine, and 200 mM L-phenylalanine and 200 mM L-tyrosine. For analysis of inhibition in the presence of chorismate, 10 mM chorismic acid (Sigma,) was prepared freshly and added to the assay solution to give final concentrations of 200 mM or 400 mM. Crystallization and data collection SeMet-substituted M. tuberculosis DAH7PS was crystallized as described,43 with the crystals used for data collection being prepared at 18 8C, by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (3 mg/ml of protein, 20 mM BTP (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 0.005% (v/v) Thesit, 200 mM PEP, 100 mM MnCl 2) and reservoir solution (0.1 M Na-Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.8 M sodium, potassium tartrate). For data collection, the crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant comprising mother liquor plus 30% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen at 110 K. These crystals proved to be trigonal, with space group P3221, unit cell dimensions aZbZ ° ° 204.1 A, cZ66.23 A, aZbZ908, gZ1208, and two DAH7PS molecules in the asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 68% (v/v). Data were collected at a wavelength ° of 0.9796 A (the peak of the Se absorption edge) on beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, CA). The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK.46 Full details of the data collection statistics are in Table 3.

Subsequent refinement indicated partial occupancies for each of these species, estimated at w0.75 for Mn2C and PEP and 0.5 for SO2K.

differences in the Se peak data set. The space group was confirmed as P3221 and the initial phases were improved ° and extended to 2.3 A using cycles of density modification in SHELXE,48 which returned a final pseudo-free correlation coefficient of 0.75. Further cycles of maximum likelihood density modification and 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging, followed by automated model building in RESOLVE49 improved the figure of merit from 0.79 to 0.84, and resulted in the building of over 60% of the structure (566 out of 924 residues from the two DAH7PS molecules, together with a further 92 residues as a polyalanine chain). The remainder of the model, apart from several regions in each molecule for which no interpretable density could be found, was added manually with TURBO FRODO and COOT50 during successive cycles of refinement with REFMAC.51 Ordered water molecules were added into discrete mjFojKjDFcj electron density peaks where the height was greater than 3s above the mean and there were potential hydrogen bonding contacts with the surrounding structure.
