ABSTRACT: The aim of this research was to determine the structure of human -parvalbumin (109 amino acids) and to compare it with its paralog and ortholog proteins. The structure was determined in solution using multinuclear and multidimensional NMR methods and refined using substitution of the EF-hand Ca2+ ion with a paramagnetic lanthanide. The resulting family of structures had a backbone rmsd of 0.50 Å. Comparison with rat oncomodulin (X-ray, 1.3 Å resolution) as well as with human (NMR, backbone rmsd of 0.49 Å) and rat (X-ray, 2.0 Å resolution) parvalbumins reveals small but reliable local differences, often but not always related to amino acid variability. The analysis of these structures has led us to propose an explanation for the different affinity for Ca2+ between R- and -parvalbumins and between parvalbumins and calmodulins.

Parvalbumins are small (11.5 kDa) Ca2+-binding proteins belonging to a protein superfamily called EF-hand by the name of the most common Ca2+-binding domain in vertebrate genomes. Parvalbumins arose in vertebrates as two sublineages, termed R and (1), with only one member each present in mammals. Even if R- and -parvalbumin, the latter also known as oncomodulin, display the same basic domain architecture and are encoded by close paralog genes with similar exon-intron arrangements (2), they substantially differ in the pattern of expression and in their Ca2+ binding properties. Therefore, they could be endowed with divergent functional roles. R-Parvalbumin is expressed mainly in fast-twitch skeletal myofibrils (3), where it is abundant, and GABAergic neurons (4), while oncomodulin was originally identified in rat hepatomas (5) and subsequently detected in the blastocyst and the cytotrophoblasts of the placenta (6).

solid tumors has also been confirmed in in Vitro models of chemical and viral carcinogenesis (7, 8), and by the immunohistochemical analysis of a number of human neoplastic tissues and primary or immortalized cell lines (9), with the recent evidence of a selective overexpression in rat mammary and pancreatic adenocarcinomas (10). The term oncomodulin has therefore been derived from its consideration as an oncofetal protein, since it is completely absent in a variety of normal mammalian tissues (11). More recently, however, oncomodulin has been found to be expressed in a very specialized district, the cochlear outer hair cells of the organ of Corti, the basic structure of the mammalian auditory system (12). Parvalbumins have been ascribed to the category of EFhand-containing Ca2+-buffering proteins, as opposed to the Ca2+-sensor proteins whose prototype is calmodulin. Both R-parvalbumin and oncomodulin are endowed with three consecutive EF-hand domains, each characterized by the consensus arrangement of two R-helices linked by a Ca2+coordinating loop in a pentagonal bipyramidal configuration, originally termed the AB, CD, and EF helices [it is indeed from the C-terminal EF segment of carp parvalbumin that the EF-hand domain derived its name three decades ago (13)]. This overall homogeneous arrangement hides substantial differences. The AB site of both parvalbumins is a nonfunctional, vestigial EF-hand due to the absence of oxygen-bearing residues at critical positions in the central loop (14). It is endowed with the interesting structural property of being associated with the hydrophobic sides of the paired CD and EF sites (15) because its antiparallel helix-loop-helix arrangement forms a plate with one polar and one hydrophobic side, the latter filling the hydrophobic

Solution Structure of Human Oncomodulin basket formed by the CD and EF domains. In R-parvalbumins, these EF-hands exhibit a Kd of <10-7 M for Ca2+ while being able to bind Mg2+ (Kd < 10-4 M) (16-18). Since highaffinity EF-hands tend to be permanently occupied by Ca2+ ions under physiological conditions, they are well-suited to serving structural and Ca2+ buffering roles. Interestingly, the CD site of rat oncomodulin, having a Kd for Ca2+ of 10-6 M and a Kd for Mg2+ of >10-3 M (19), has to be ascribed to the other category of EF-hands with respect to Ca2+ affinity, that of low-affinity sites, unoccupied at basal intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, which undergo conformational change with Ca2+ binding following the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. This change is typical of Ca2+-sensing proteins, which expose effector binding sites and perform regulatory roles. Although, taken together, these observations are consistent with a regulatory function of oncomodulin, no effector protein has been identified to date, and no convincing biochemical regulatory activity has been demonstrated for oncomodulin, despite some early proposals (20-22). In an attempt to gain further clues that would be useful in solving the problem of the opposing putative buffer/sensing functions of this interesting Ca2+-binding protein, in this paper, we present the solution structure of human Ca2+loaded oncomodulin as determined by NMR1 spectroscopy. The available structure of human R-parvalbumin (23), obtained previously by our group with the same experimental approach, allows a detailed comparison of the structural features of the two proteins and of their potential Ca2+ binding properties. A further comparison with the X-ray structures of rat R- and -parvalbumins (24, 25) is also reported. Altogether, the structural data presented and the comparisons we have performed with the rat orthologs suggest an interpretation which could explain the high differential affinity for Ca2+ and Mg2+ of the two parvalbumins in the absence of marked conformational differences, and which could also indicate that indeed both proteins are evolutionarily "degenerated" versions of true Ca2+-sensing proteins. Following this perspective, this work adds a structural rationale to a signaling role for oncomodulin, which is also more consistent with a specialized physiological activity of this protein in the mammalian auditory system and with a perturbation of signal transduction events by its unscheduled expression during oncogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Gene Cloning. The gene encoding human oncomodulin was amplified by PCR starting from human cerebellar cDNA, using the following oligonucleotides as primers: upper strand

Amplification was carried out using the thermostable PfuI polymerase (Stratagene) to reduce the error rate and the addition of non-template-directed nucleotides at the 3 end of the PCR-generated fragment. The blunt-ended oncomodulin cDNA from PCR amplification was purified from an agarose gel, phosphorylated, and then cloned into the StuI site of the multiple cloning site of plasmid pQE30Xa (Qiagen) by blunt-end ligation. The pQE30Xa expression plasmid is designed for expression of His-tagged proteins. The "Quick ligation kit" (New England Biolabs) was used to maximize the yield of the ligation reaction which was then transformed into supercompetent Xl1Blue cells (Novagen). The colonies obtained on LB (with ampicillin) plates were screened for protein expression. Plasmids from bacterial colonies expressing a protein of the correct molecular mass were purified and sequenced. All the samples that were sequenced contained a single nucleotide variation with respect to the reference NM_006188 GenBank sequence for human oncomodulin at position 59. This variation changes the second nucleotide of the CAA codon, encoding glutamine at position 19, to the CGA codon, encoding arginine. Inspection of the dbSNP database revealed that the transition from A to G at position 59 of the oncomodulin cDNA is recorded as the only nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism present, annotated with unvalidated status and unknown allele frequency (SNP entry rs13312633). Therefore, our recombinant oncomodulin sequence is very likely a true allelic variant of the reference oncomodulin gene, and not an artifact or a mutation. Protein Purification. Recombinant His-tagged human [15N]oncomodulin was purified from Escherichia coli Xl1Blue grown in 2 L of minimal medium (MM) containing [15N]ammonium sulfate as the nitrogen source. The 13C- and 15Nlabeled protein sample was obtained using the same medium, but replacing [12C]glucose with [13C]glucose. The cells from 2 L of LB culture in the exponential growth phase (A600 ) 0.5/0.6) were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm, rinsed with 20 mL of MM, and centrifuged again, to remove any amount of rich medium. The pellet was resuspended in 10 mL of MM and transferred to 2 L of MM containing 0.2% glucose (preculture/final volume ratio ) 1/1). IPTG was used to induce protein expression and was added to the culture 2.5 h after incubation. Incubation of the preculture and final culture was carried out at 37 °C, shaking at 150 rpm for 15 h after induction. Cells were collected from stationary-phase cultures (typically 15 h after induction with IPTG) by centrifugation at 8000 rpm, for 15 min, and resuspended in 25 mL of buffer 1 [20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM MgSO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 100 mM KCl, DNase, and 1 mM PMSF]. Disruption of the cells was achieved by two passages through a French press (1000 psi). The lysate was then centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant, containing the soluble recombinant protein, was loaded onto a 5 mL HiTRAP chelating column (Pharmacia), previously conditioned with buffer 2 [20 mM Tris (pH 8.0)]. After two washing steps with 50 mL of buffer 2 and 50 mL of buffer 3 [20 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 300 mM KCl (pH 6.0)], elution of the protein was carried out in one step, using buffer 4 [20 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 300 mM imidazole].

16078 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 51, 2004 The protein was then dialyzed against buffer 5, for factor Xa [20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl2], and concentrated to 3 mL. Factor Xa was added to the protein (150 µg of enzyme/10 mg of protein), and the mixture was incubated at 23 °C for 16 h under mild shaking to cleave the histidine tag. The tag and the uncut protein were removed from the mixture through a passage on the HiTRAP chelating column. Remaining contaminants were removed by gel filtration on a Superdex G-75 HiLoad column, at room temperature, in 0.1 M NaCl. The pH of the protein was adjusted to 6.0, and the sample was concentrated to the final volume of 0.5 mL. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, assuming 274 ) 3260 M-1 cm-1 (26), and the purity was checked on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. NMR Sample Preparation and Measurements. The NMR samples were prepared by dissolving the protein in 600 µL of an aqueous solution containing 100 mM NaCl and 10% D2O. The pH was adjusted to 6.5 using 0.01 M NaOH or HCl solutions. The final concentrations of the singly and doubly labeled samples were around 4 mM. The Tb3+-substituted oncomodulin (CaTbOM) sample, with Tb3+ replacing the Ca2+ ion in the EF site, was prepared by titration of the dicalcium oncomodulin (CaCaOM), up to a Tb3+/Ca2+ ratio of 0.9/1 to avoid occupancy of other sites. The titration progress was followed by two-dimensional (2D) 1H-15N HSQC (27) spectra at 700 MHz. The achievement of the desired Tb3+/Ca2+ ratio of 0.9/1 was monitored (28), as cross-peaks of the CaCaOM form disappeared, while the new signals of the CaTbOM complex developed their full intensity. The NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AVANCE 700 spectrometer (700.13 MHz nominal proton frequency), and the R1, R2, and NOE relaxation measurements were taken at 283 and 298 K using a Bruker AVANCE 600 spectrometer (600.13 MHz nominal proton frequency). Both spectrometers were equipped with a triple-resonance (TXI) 5 mm probe with a z-axis pulse field gradient. All spectra were recorded at 283 K. The water signal was suppressed using presaturation during the relaxation delay and mixing time or by using the WATERGATE (29) method. All NMR experiments are described in the Supporting Information. The 2D spectra were processed with XWINNMR Bruker software, while the three-dimensional (3D) spectra were processed with NMRPipe (30). All spectra were analyzed by Sparky (University of California, San Francisco, CA) (31) using extensions written in python computer language. To obtain PCS values of the native protein and Tb3+substituted derivative, 1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded at 298 K using spectral widths of 14 and 38 ppm in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively; 256 increments each with 1024 complex data points and 48 transients were collected. Raw data were multiplied in both dimensions by a squared cosine window function and Fourier transformed to obtain a final matrix of 1024 × 1024, or 512 × 512 real data points for HSQC spectra. A polynomial baseline correction was applied in the f2 dimension. One-bond 1H-15N coupling constants were measured at 298 K and 700 MHz either by fitting a series of 1 JNH-modulated HSQC spectra (32) or by using the IPAP method (33).

Babini et al. The relaxation measurements were carried out by recording a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra with flip-back (34) and phase sensitive pulse sequences (35). R1 and R2 were both measured with 10 different delays and a CPMG pulse sequence (36) with a refocusing delay, m, of 450 µs for the R2 measurements. R1 and R2 were calculated by fitting the peak heights versus delay time using a single-exponential decay according to the Levenberg-Marquardt equation (37, 38). Uncertainties were determined by using a Monte Carlo approach (39). Heteronuclear 1H-15N NOEs were calculated by taking the ratio of peak volumes with and without 1H saturation. Structure Calculation. 3D NOESY-HSQC cross-peak volumes were determined with Sparky using Gaussian peak shapes. The validity of the integration results was tracked by checking the line width of each dimension. The integrals were converted to upper distance limits by CALIBA (40). Dihedral  and  angles, stereospecific assignments, and H-bonds were the additional input constraints for structure calculations. DYANA (41) employing torsion angle dynamics (TAD) combined with a simulated annealing algorithm was used to calculate a series of 200 structures in 10 000 annealing steps starting from randomly generated conformers. The quality of each structure is described by the value of a target function that is proportional to the squared deviations of the calculated restraints from the experimental ones plus the squared van der Waals violations. The metal ions were introduced by a linker made of pseudoatoms to the Cterminus and were imposed to be between 2.0 and 2.8 Å from the donor atoms of the CD- and EF-hand (42-44). The PCS and RDC values for the Tb3+-substituted derivative were used as paramagnetic restraints together with all diamagnetic restraints through the appropriate PARAMAGNETICDYANA modules (45). Tolerances of (10% or (0.10 ppm for the PCS values and (0.50 Hz for RDC values were used for the structural calculation. A fixed weight of 0.5 for PCS and 0.1 for RDC values relative to the weight of 1 for the NOEs was used in the calculations. The 20 structures with the lowest target function were included in the final set to determine the rmsd values from the mean for the backbone atoms and for all heavy atoms. MOLMOL (46) and PROCHECK (47) were subsequently used for secondary structure analysis. The final family of the 20 best structures was minimized by iterative cycles of PARAMAGNETIC-DYANA, coupled to the RAMADYANA module (48) followed by restrained energy minimization (REM) with AMBER 5.0 (49). The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB entry 1TTX). RESULTS The parallel analysis of CBCANH and CBCA(CO)NH (50) led to the backbone resonance assignment. One hundred three of 108 amide resonances were assigned in this way. The missing amino acids, two prolines, two glutamates, and one glutamine, were found later by analyzing the 3D NOESY-HSQC (51) spectrum. The analysis of the HN(CA)CO and HNCO spectra (50) allowed us to assign the carbonyl resonances of the protein.

Solution Structure of Human Oncomodulin Furthermore, we detected 18 H-bonds in the TROSY-like HNCO spectra (52). The aliphatic side chain spin systems were obtained through the 3D CC(CO)NH spectra (53) and (H)CCHTOCSY spectra (54) and in some cases with the help of 3D NOESY-HSQC spectra. The assignment of the aromatic resonances was carried out by the analysis of 2D NOESY (55) and 2D TOCSY (55) spectra. The side chain NH2 resonances of the glutamines and asparagines were assigned while analyzing the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum together with the 3D NOESY-HSQC spectra. The backbone  and  angles were estimated by the chemical shift index (CSI) (56). 3JHNHR coupling constants were determined in the 600 MHz HNHA (57) experiment. Eight R-helices, whose position was identical with that of the corresponding helices of the rat oncomodulin, were predicted by CSI. The 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments are in the Supporting Information. The assigned nuclei are 98, 93, and 96.5% for 1H, 13C, and 15N, respectively. NOE Restraints. The analysis of the 13C-edited and 15N edited 3D NOESY-HSQC spectra provided 2300 assigned cross-peaks and 1912 unique upper distance limits, of which 1708 were found to be meaningful. The meaningful constraints consisted of 160 intraresidue, 537 sequential, 640 medium-range, and 371 long-range NOEs. The plot of the meaningful NOEs per residue is shown in the Supporting Information. The average of the meaningful NOEs per residue is around 17; 31 stereospecific assignments were identified by GLOMSA (40). Distance restraints, dihedral angles, stereospecific assignments, and H-bonds were used for structure calculations (Table 1). Pseudocontact Shifts. It is well-known, and here confirmed, that lanthanides occupy the C-terminal EF-hand loop of EF-hand domains in general and of parvalbumins in particular (58-60), without inducing structural perturbations outside the immediate vicinity of the metal ion (61). Tb3+ has been chosen as one of the lanthanides providing the largest PCS because we were interested in the refinement of the AB domain with the respect to the rest of the protein (28, 42). Tb3+ in CaTbOM broadens lines sometimes beyond detection; 74 (62 backbone NH and 12 side chain NH2) of 88 detectable peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the Tb3+-substituted protein (CaTbOM) were assigned in a semiautomated way using predictions based on the paramagnetic susceptibility anisotropy and the predicted structure as discussed elsewhere (23). The metal-nuclei distances and the ratios between 1H and 15N pseudocontact shifts were also taken into account during the assignment procedure. These ratios were considered to be in the range of 0.75-1.30 for all NH groups that are more than 12 Å from the metal. The anisotropy tensor parameters were calculated using the PCS values of 14 1H-15N HSQC peaks, by FANTASIA (62). The equation relating PCS and the magnetic anisotropy parameters is (63)

RDC (64) are due to partial orientation of the molecules in the magnetic field due to anistropic susceptibility and are detected through 1J measurements. The paramagnetic contributions to RDC for backbone amides were determined as a difference between the iJ measured in the Tb3+-substituted derivative and those measured on the native protein.

Other symbols have their usual meaning. RDC values of 37 NHs could be measured which were evenly distributed along the sequence, except the stretch of the Tb3+-binding loop (residues 90-101). A plot of calculated versus experimental RDC values is given in the Supporting Information. RDC values used in structure calculations for CaTbOM are also given in the Supporting Information. The final tensor parameters, after structure refinement, were (39.6 ( 0.8) × 10-32 and (5.7 ( 0.8) × 10-32 m3. In summary for the structure calculation, a total of 1708 meaningful NOEs, 55  and 55  dihedral angles, 31 stereospecific proton pairs, 18 hydrogen bonds, 142 PCS, and 37 RDC (Table 1) were used in DYANA calculations using the PSEUDYANA module (62). Paramagnetic restraints improved the quality of the structure (Table 2) not only for the residues for which PCS or PCS and RDC values were available but also elsewhere. Particularly, all nonhelical parts were improved. The two calcium binding sites are quite improved, despite the fact that no restraints could be obtained in the immediate neighborhood of the paramagnetic metal. Also, a relevant improvement was obtained for helix 3. The mean rmsd values per residue for the two structure families calculated using diamagnetic restraints only and diamagnetic restraints with both PCS and RDC values are given in the Supporting Information. Figure 1 shows the final family of 20 conformers. For the average final structure, 79.8% of the residues are in most favored regions and 20.2% in additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1). These statistics demonstrate a good quality of the solution structure as confirmed by the fact that they do not substantially change using the RAMADYANA module (48).

Mobility Data. The NMR experiments for mobility data were performed at either 283 or 298 K using a 600 MHz spectrometer. The average R1, R2, and NOE values are consistent with a monomeric 12 kDa protein. The relaxation rates merely showed fluctuation along the sequence, showing that no regions are highly flexible. We did not notice a significant increase in mobility when the temperature was increased from 283 to 298 K. DISCUSSION Comparison with the Paralog Human R-ParValbumin and Their Rat Orthologs. A detailed comparison between the 3D structure of human and rat OM, which is available at 1.3 Å resolution, showed a good agreement between the two structures, as expected. The two ortholog proteins in fact have a level of residue identity of 88%. Table 3 shows the sequence alignment for human and rat oncomodulins together with human and rat R-parvalbumins. A secondary structure comparison is also shown. The solution structure of human OM is characterized by the following secondary structure elements (residues in parentheses): R1 (2-4), R2 (7-17), R3 (26-32), R4 (40-50), 1 (57 and 58), R5 (60-63), R6 (64-69), R7 (79-89), 2 (97 and 98), and R8 (99-107). The secondary structure elements found are largely in agreement with the ones of the crystal structure of rat OM, as expected, with the only exception being helix 5, which starts one amino acid before and is immediately connected to helix 6, giving rise to a single-kink helix, while in the rat structure, the two helices are divided by a two-residue linker. The latter helices are separated by a short connecting linker also in the human and rat PV structure, as shown in Table 3. Only few local differences are present. As previously done in the comparison of human and rat PV (23), the Ramachan-

a Angles and distances were calculated with interhlx (66). Sign convention is as described by Drohat et al. (73). Helix A consists of residues 10-17, helix B residues 26-32, helix C residues 40-50, helix D residues 60-63, helix E residues 79-89, and helix F residues 99-107.

dran values of each residue were analyzed for the two ortholog proteins (Table 3) to obtain information about these local but still important differences. By looking at these differences in detail, we find it is apparent that some residues are in different regions (e.g., from the A to the B region of the Ramachandran plane or vice versa) between the two ortholog proteins. All the differences are related to residues located in loops: Leu 6, Ser 7, Arg 75, Glu 76, and Leu 77. In the case of Leu 6, which occurs before helix 2, the Ramachandran plot shows that the  and  angles of this residue are in the A region, whereas those of rat OM are in the B region. In this case, the residues that immediately precede the sequence are different. In fact, for the human OM, we have a Val at position 5, while in the case of the rat, the residue preceding Leu 6 is an Ile. The same residue showed such differences in the Ramachandran values for the human R-PV as previously described (23). The following residue, Ser 7, exhibits the same behavior with  and  dihedral angles characteristic of the A region in the Ramachandran plot for the human OM structure. An ADD stretch follows Ser 7 in the human OM, while an AED stretch follows in rat OM and both human and rat PVs. A second difference between the two structures is observed at residues 75-77, which are in the linker connecting the

CD and EF sites (residues 70-78). The  and  angles place these residues in the A, A, and A regions, respectively, whereas those of the rat protein are in the B, B, and B regions, respectively. Another difference is related to Glu 60, which is clearly in the A region and therefore is the starting residue of helix 6. The corresponding amino acid in rat OM is a Gly, and its  and  angles are out of the allowed regions in the Ramachandran plot. A comparison with the two R-parvalbumins showed that residue 60, which is a Glu in both cases, is also placed in the A region of the Ramachandran plane. In summary, there are three different regions in human OM, around Ser 7, Gly 60, and Arg 75, that show a distinct change, beyond uncertainty, in the local fold with respect to rat OM, and in each of these three cases, this difference is related to a difference in one amino acid between the two ortholog proteins. A detailed comparison of interhelix angles and distances of OM with its ortholog and paralog proteins showed some small differences of a more global nature. The interhelix angles, calculated with the interhlx program (66) in Table 4, are defined between the two helix stretches closest to the AB, CD, and EF sites, and therefore involve helices R2 and R3, R4 and R5, and R7 and R8. The interhelix distances are measured between midpoints of the helices.

FIGURE 2: Superposition of calcium-loaded human oncomodulin (blue) and parvalbumin (red). The helix pairs are shown with different color intensities, becoming lighter going from the Nterminus (AB, dark) to the C-terminus (EF, light). In panel A, the molecules are oriented in such a way that the bottom of the "basket" formed by the C-terminal domain (EF-hands CD and EF) is at the bottom part of the figure and the basket "lid" constituted by helices A and B is at the top. In panel B, the molecules are rotated about the x-axis by 90°, relative to the orientation in panel A. From this perspective, the side shift of the AB domain with respect to the linker between helices D and E is evidenced.

FIGURE 3: Surface representation (VdW radii) of human oncomodulin (A) and parvalbumin (B). The N-terminal AB domain (residues 1-33) is colored blue, the linker between helices B and C (residues 34-39) white, the CD EF-hand (residues 40-63) cyan, the linker between helices D and E (residues 64-78) magenta, and the C-terminal EF EF-hand (residues 79-108) yellow. The molecules have the same orientation, after best fit superposition of helices C-F. Note the poorer fit between the AB domain and the D-E linker in OM with respect to PV.

By first examining the functional C-terminal domain of all proteins (CD and EF sites), we keep the EF angle constant in both rat and human OM, being higher in PV, while the CD angle is much smaller in human OM than in rat OM, accentuating the trend already observed between human and rat PV. Much larger variations are found in the AB domain, since the AB angle differs by as much as 22° between human OM and PV. Interestingly, the same angle has an intermediate value in both rat proteins. The interhelical distances reflect the same difference between the human and rat protein. Another feature that is worth noting is the variation in the AE interhelical distances. They are smaller in OM than in PV, and within each ortholog, they are smaller in the human than in the rat proteins. The BE interhelical distance is also shorter in human OM than in the other proteins. Overall, the AB site in OM (and particularly in human OM) is closer

to the CD and EF sites than it is in PV. In Figure 2, the solution structures of the two Ca2+-loaded human proteins are superimposed with MOLMOL (46). It is evident that while the CD and EF sites are very much coincident, the nonfunctional AB site is rather different in orientation in the two PVs. This geometrical difference can be described (Figure 2B) as a down-left movement of helix A in OM, which in turn pushes helix B toward helix F, the latter being forced toward the bottom of the CD-EF basket (Figure 2A). Looking at the surface of the two proteins (Figure 3), we find that the overall result of such an extensive movement is the enlargement of the crevice located between the AB domain (blue) and the linker connecting helices D and E (magenta). Inferences from the Structural Comparison. A comparison with Ca2+-loaded EF-hand pairs III and IV of human calmodulin (CaM) shows that these two EF-hands have a structural arrangement that is very similar to those of the CD and EF sites of human OM and PV (Figure 4). The overall structural similarity between the two human PVs and with CaM is in line with the hypothesis that they share a common evolutionary ancestor endowed with the prototypical calmodulin-like structure of two EF-hand pairs separated by

FIGURE 4: Superposition (stereoview) of human oncomodulin (blue) and the C-terminal domain of human calmodulin (red) bound to the C20W peptide (yellow) belonging to the N-terminal portion of the CaM-binding domain of the plasma membrane calcium pump. The helix pairs are shown with different color intensities, becoming lighter going from the N-terminus to the C-terminus. The superposition was obtained by best fitting the CD and EF domains of OM with the corresponding C-terminal sites III and IV of CaM. It appears that the endogenous AB domain of OM occupies a position very similar to that of the exogenous C20W peptide bound to CaM.

FIGURE 5: Thermodynamic cycle describing the binding to an apo EF-hand pair domain (Ef-hD) of two calcium ions and a target peptide, in whatever order. The higher affinity of the peptide for the calcium form (K3 . K2) implies a higher affinity of calcium for the apo EF-hand pair-peptide adduct (K4 . K1).

a linker. The presence in the m-RNA 5-UTR of vertebrate R-PVs of a pseudocoding sequence for an EF-hand favors this possibility, by which a first evolutionary branching from the calmodulin-like ancestor was determined by the loss of the first EF-hand and the loss of Ca2+ binding ability of the second EF-hand, in an unknown order. Given the strong similarity of the C-terminal halves of PVs, it is difficult to understand why the OM CD site is 1 order of magnitude less able to bind Ca2+ than the corresponding PV site (14). However, the observation described here of a different arrangement of the AB site with respect to the CD and EF sites may hint at a possible explanation. Calcium binding in CaM and other calcium sensor proteins is known to dramatically increase the affinity of one (or two) EF-hand pair(s) for a target peptide with respect to the corresponding calcium-free EF-hand pair. From a thermodynamic point of view, this is equivalent to stating that the presence of a bound target peptide increases the affinity for calcium of a calcium-free EF-hand pair. In Figure 5, a thermodynamic cycle describing the binding to an apo EFhand pair domain (Ef-hD) of two calcium ions (assumed to be cooperative without a loss of generality) and a target peptide, in whatever order, is shown (67-69). As it is wellknown that in a typical Ca2+-activated EF-hand K3 . K2, it follows that K4 . K1; i.e., binding of calcium to an apo EFhand is enhanced by the presence of a bound peptide. If we view the AB sites in R- and -PVs as endogenous "target peptides", the high calcium affinity of parvalbumins is justified, and the differences in calcium affinity between the two proteins may be related to the different stability of the

resulting "adduct". Indeed, upon removal of the AB loop in pike PV, the calcium affinity of the remaining CD-EF fragment decreases by 2 orders of magnitude (70), suggesting that evolution of the AB site to an abortive site was instrumental in the increase of the Ca2+ affinity of the CDEF domain in PVs. It is worth recalling that the level of sequence identity between the two proteins is 50%, but the conserved residues are differently distributed among EF-hand pairs. Indeed, the AB site has the lowest level of identity (44%), followed by the EF (50%) and CD (53%) pairs. Additionally, the loop between helices A and B shows an even larger variance: only two residues of eight are conserved, while four and eight of nine residues are conserved in the CD and EF loops, respectively. It is possible, therefore, that given the intrinsic differences between the two AB sites, their "binding" to the rest of the protein is weaker in OM than it is in PV. Figure 3 suggests that the AB site, composed of helices A and B separated by the AB linker, is less engulfed in the hydrophobic pocket defined by the BC and DE linkers in OM (Figure 3A) than it is in PV (Figure 3B). Although less evident in the rat orthologs, the presence of a deeper surface pocket involving residue 18 was also pointed out. Finally, it may be interesting to compare the arrangement of the AB site in the two proteins with those of target peptides that are known to bind to only the C-terminal domains of CaM (71) and myosin light chains (72), at variance with the classical peptide binding mode involving both N- and C-terminal domains. Figure 4 shows a superposition of human OM with the C-terminal domain of CaM bound to a peptide (C20W) belonging to the N-terminal portion of the CaM-binding domain of the plasma membrane calcium pump (71). After the EF-hand pairs are superimposed, the AB domain occupies a position similar to that of C20W, with the beginning of helix A being very close to the N-terminus of C20W and with helix B very close to its C-terminus.
