Structures of Plasmodium falciparum triosephosphate isomerase complexed to substrate analogues: observation of the catalytic loop in the open conformation in the ligand-bound state
The glycolytic enzymes of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) are attractive drug targets as the parasites lack a functional tricarboxylic cycle and hence depend heavily on glycolysis for their energy requirements. Structural comparisons between Pf triosephosphate isomerase (PfTIM) and its human homologue have highlighted the important differences between the host and parasite enzymes [Velanker et al. (1997), Structure, 5, 751± 761]. Structures of various PfTIM±ligand complexes have been determined in order to gain further insight into the mode of inhibitor binding to the parasite enzyme. Structures of two PfTIM±substrate analogue complexes, those of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) and glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), have been Ê determined and re®ned at 2.4 A resolution. Both complexes crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21, with a molecular dimer in the asymmetric unit. The novel aspect of these structures is the adoption of the `loop-open' conformation, with the catalytic loop (loop 6, residues 166±176) positioned away from the active site; this loop is known to Ê move by about 7 A towards the active site upon inhibitor binding in other TIMs. The loop-open form in the PfTIM complexes appears to be a consequence of the S96F mutation, which is speci®c to the enzymes from malarial parasites. Structural comparison with the corresponding complexes of Trypanosoma brucei TIM (TrypTIM) shows that extensive steric clashes may be anticipated between Phe96 and Ile172 in the `closed' conformation of the catalytic loop, preventing loop closure in PfTIM. Ser73 in PfTIM (Ala in all other known TIMs) appears to provide an anchoring water-mediated hydrogen bond to the ligand, compensating for the loss of a stabilizing hydrogen bond from Gly171 NH in the closed-loop liganded TIM structures.

1. Introduction
Antimalarial research has received considerable attention recently owing to the emergence of resistant strains of the malarial parasites (Olliaro & Yuthavong, 1999; Winstanley, 2000). Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) is the most virulent, compared with that caused by other Plasmodium species. The glycolytic enzymes of the malarial parasite are attractive targets for the development of antimalarials since in the asexual stage of the parasite in the human erythrocytes glycolysis is the sole source to meet the energy requirement of the parasite (Roth et al., 1988). As a part of a program to develop Pf triosephosphate isomerase (PfTIM) as a drug target (Subbayya et al., 1997), we have determined structures of unliganded (Velanker et al., 1997) and liganded forms of the enzyme.

Triosephosphate isomerase

research papers
TIM catalyses the isomerization between dihyroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (d-GAP). The active site of the enzyme is essentially composed of the triad Lys12, His95 and Glu165 (Alber et al., 1987). Apart from these residues, an 11-residue loop, known as the ¯exible or catalytic loop (loop 6, residues 166±176), plays a crucial role in preventing phosphate elimination of the cisenediol intermediate leading to the production of cytotoxic methylglyoxal (Pompliano et al., 1990; Knowles, 1991). The PfTIM sequence is unique in that there is a Phe at position 96, proximal to the active site, which is Ser in enzymes from other sources (Parthasarathy et al., private communication). In spite of this mutation, PfTIM is fully catalytically competent, with kcat and Km values of 2.68 Æ 0.84 Â 105 minÀ1 and 0.35 Æ 0.16, respectively, for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) as substrate (Singh et al., 2001). This mutation, however, seems to greatly in¯uence the conformation of the catalytic loop. Loop 6 of TIM has almost always been observed in the `closed' conformation in crystal structures of ligand complexes. We have obtained both loop-open and loop-closed conformations of PfTIM in the presence of the transitionstate analogue phosphoglycolate (PG; Parthasarathy et al., private communication). Structural analysis of the loop-open form of the PfTIM±PG complex suggests that a possible steric clash between the bulky Phe96 residue and Ile170 (a ¯exible loop residue) hinders the loop closure. However, in the structure of the loopclosed form of the PfTIM±PG complex, residues Phe96 and Leu167 occur in alternative conformations, both of which are different from those observed in the unbound and ligand-bound loop-open forms of PfTIM. Except for this complex and that of trypanosomal TIM with 4hydroxyphosphonobutanamide (4PBH; Verlinde et al., 1992), where the bulky ligand was speci®cally selected to prevent the loop closure, TIM±ligand complexes have always been observed with loopclosed conformations. The observation of the ligand-bound loop-open form of PfTIM±PG complex prompted the investigation of other PfTIM inhibitor complexes with the view of assessing the relation between inhibitor structure and loop conformation in the complex. We describe in this report the structures of the complexes of PfTIM with 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) and with glycerol-3phosphate (G3P; Fig. 1 shows the Ê chemical structures) at 2.4 A resolution. The structures represents additional examples of novel loop-open conformation of PfTIM. Implications of these structures for inhibitor design are discussed.

PfTIM was cloned into pTrc 99A vector, known as pARC 1008, and overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain AA200, which has a null mutation in the host TIM gene. The cells were initially grown in 100 ml of Luria broth for about 6 h at 310 K and transferred to 1 l of Terri®c broth. After 4 h, cells were induced using IPTG and growth was continued for a further 8 h. Cells were harvested (centrifuged at 5000 rev minÀ1 for 20 min at 277 K), washed with minimal volume of Tris buffer pH 7.4 and crushed using a French press. Proteins dissolved in the cell lysate were initially precipitated using 70% [42%(w/ v)] saturated ammonium sulfate and then at 95% [63%(w/v)] saturation. The resultant ammonium sulfate pellet dissolved in about 5 ml of cold water was dialyzed extensively against 20 mM Tris buffer pH 8.0. Protein was further puri®ed using an anion-exchange Resource Q (from Pharmacia) column using an FPLC system. A 0±0.5 M NaCl gradient was used for eluting the protein. Alternatively, pure protein could also be obtained by subjecting the dialyzed pellet to two rounds of gel ®ltration on a Sephadex G-100 column. The ®nal purity of the protein was checked using both SDS±PAGE and ESI±MS. Better crystals, however, were obtained with protein samples puri®ed using a Resource Q column.

Conditions that were found suitable for growing well ordered crystals of wild-type PfTIM (hanging-drop setup, 24% PEG 6000 in 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, with 1 mM DTT) did not lead to good-quality crystals of PfTIM complexed with the ligands, although the rate of appearance of crystals was generally enhanced. Under these and slightly modi®ed conditions, crystals of complexes were obtained within 3 d. Subsequently, an amorphous deposit on these thin needle-like crystals formed, which made them fragile and unsuitable for high-resolution studies. These crystals belonged to space group P212121. Replacement of PEG 4000 by PEG 1450 resulted in fewer crystals with larger size and improved morphology. After several trials, the following condition was found to be optimal. The bottom well contained 8±24% of PEG 1450 and 100 mM sodium acetate pH 4±5.0. The protein (dialysed against distilled water) concentration was 10 mg mlÀ1. 3 ml each of protein and the respective ligand in molar ratios of either 1:50 or 1:100 were mixed and allowed to equilibrate for at least 1 h. Crystals appeared within 3±7 d and Ê diffracted to 2.4 A resolution at room temperature.
2.3. Data collection and processing

complex, 200 frames were collected, each of 1 oscillation. The crystal-to-detector distance (D) was kept at 100 mm and each frame was exposed for 10 min with two passes. For the TIM± G3P complex, 300 frames were collected using two different orientations, with parameters the same as those used for the TIM±3PG crystal. The data sets were processed using the DENZO/SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) suite of programs.
2.4. Structure solution and refinement

Diffraction data from the crystals were collected at room temperature using a MAR300 image-plate system mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode X-ray generator equipped with a 200 mm focal cup. The initial examination of the data frames showed that the crystals of the TIM±3PG and TIM± G3P complexes have similar unit-cell parameters (Table 1) and belong to the monoclinic space group P21. The asymmetric units correspond to a dimer, with a Matthews Ê coef®cient of 2.26 A3 DaÀ1 calculated using a molecular weight of 55 662 Da for the TIM dimer. For the TIM±3PG

Molecular replacement (MR; Rossmann, 1990) was carried out using the AMoRe suite of programs (Navaza & Saludian, 1997), using the coordinates of wild-type PfTIM as the starting model (PDB code 1ydv), which was determined earlier at Ê 2.2 A resolution (Velanker et al., 1997). As expected, MR led to a unique solution. The model was further re®ned using the `mlf (maximum likelihood in amplitudes)' option of the CNS È program suite (Pannu & Read, 1996; Brunger et al., 1998). Ê Data between 20.0 and 2.4 A resolution were used for the re®nement, accepting re¯ections with amplitudes greater than 0.1' after setting aside 10% of the data for cross-validation È È (Brunger, 1992; Kleywegt & Brunger, 1996). Anisotropic B scaling, bulk-solvent correction and non-crystallographic restraints (twofold) were employed throughout the re®nement. After initial rigid-body and positional re®nement, ' A-weighted 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps (Read, 1986) were calculated and visualized using the interactive model-building programs FRODO (Jones, 1978) and O (Jones et al., 1991).

The ligand and the active-site residues Lys12, His95 and Glu165 are shown in blue and khaki, respectively. Two stretches of residues, Gly209-Gly210-Ser211-Val212 and Leu230-Val231-Gly232-Asn233, anchoring the phosphate group through several watermediated and direct interactions are shown in cyan and pink, respectively. Ser73, involved in a water-mediated intersubunit interaction in the physiological dimer, is shown in red.

Analyses were performed at three different levels, viz. between crystallographically independent subunits, between complexed and uncomplexed PfTIM structures and between PfTIM and TrypTIM structures. Comparisons were made with respect to changes in main-chain and side-chain geometry, changes in activesite residues and changes in the positions of water molecules. Structural alignments were carried out using the programs ALIGN (Cohen, 1997) or the lsq_ex option in O (Jones et al., 1991). The active-site superpositions were performed using locally available codes. Ligand interactions and symmetry-related contacts were analysed using the programs LIGPLOT (Wallace et al., 1995) and CONTACT from the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Structural illustrations were produced using the programs MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991), BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1999), Raster3D (Merritt & Bacon, 1997) and InsightII (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA).

The observed break in the electron density for G3P seen in one of the subunits could be a consequence of both partial occupancy and dynamic disorder. The group occupancies for G3P were re®ned to a values of 0.86 and 0.96 in the A and B subunits, respectively.
3.2. Protein±ligand interactions 3.2.1. PfTIM±3PG complex. No signi®cant differences in the conformation of the polypeptide fold are observed between the A and B subunits of the PfTIM±3PG complex. Ê Table 2 gives all polar contacts within 3.8 A made by the atoms of 3PG in the A and B subunits. Fig. 2 shows the active-site interactions in the A subunit. Water molecules mediate the majority of the contacts between the ligand and the protein atoms (Fig. 2). Indeed, the interaction between the carboxy end of the ligand, which corresponds to the reactive end of the substrate (dihydroxyacetone phosphate, DHAP or dglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; d-GAP) and the catalytic base Glu165 is also water-mediated. The almost identical distances between the interacting atoms of the protein and the 3PG O1 and O3 atoms are indeed in agreement with the suggested cisenediol transition state (Alber et al., 1981). The main-chain N atom of Gly232 interacts with O2 of 3PG in both the subunits. At the other end, the phosphate group of 3PG is held by several water-mediated interactions. The catalytic residue Lys12 interacts with one of the O atoms of phosphate group through a water molecule. The only direct interactions between the phosphate group and protein atoms are those involving O3P±Ser211 and O4P±Asn233 in the A subunit and O3P and O4P with Asn233 in the B subunit. 3.2.2. Catalytic loop (loop 6) conformation. In essentially all TIM±ligand complexes reported so far, the ¯exible catalytic loop (loop 6, residues 166±176) adopts a closed conformation, with the main-chain NH of Gly171 forming a hydrogen bond with one of the phosphate O atoms of the bound ligands. The transition from the loop-open (unliganded TIM) to the loopclosed (liganded TIM) form involves a large movement Ê (approximately 7.0 A) of the ¯exible loop. The only example of a ligand-bound TIM with an open-loop conformation is that of TrypTIM bound to the competitive inhibitor N-hydroxy4-phosphonobutanamide (4PBH; Verlinde et al., 1992). Interestingly, in the PfTIM±3PG complex, the ¯exible loop remains in the open conformation. The interaction between 3PG and the main-chain NH of Gly171 is water-mediated in both subunits of the PfTIM±3PG complex. Two and three water molecules seem to bridge this interaction in the A and B subunits, respectively. In the B subunit, water molecule 631 is Ê placed at a distance of 2.39 A from the main-chain N of Gly171. The distance between this water molecule and the Ê next water molecule (589) is 3.13 A. Water molecule 589 Ê interacts with 579 at a distance of 3.46 A and this in turn Ê interacts with O2P of 3PG at a distance of 3.31 A. Water molecule 579 also interacts with the side chain of Ser73 (from the neighbouring subunit).

In the PfTIM±3PG complex, the absence of a stabilizing interaction involving the loop residue (Gly171) appears to be compensated for by an interaction contributed by the neighbouring subunit. In both the A and the B subunits, Ser73 is involved in a water-mediated interaction with a phosphate O atom of the ligand bound to the other subunit. The OH group Ê of this residue is at a distance of 2.56 A from water 578, which in turn is at a Ê distance of 2.55 A from O4P of the phosphate group of 3PG in the A subunit.

the active-site residues. As in the PfTIM complexes, the catalytic Glu167 is involved in a water-mediated interaction with the ligand atoms in the G3P and 3PG complexes of TrypTIM. However, the conformations of the side chain of the catalytic base are different in the two enzymes. Noble et al. (1991) have described two distinct conformations for Glu167 that differ in the sign of their 11 values. A positive 11 value of about 55 corresponds to the `swung-in' conformation where OE2 of Glu points towards the ligand. The negative value de®nes the `swung-out' conformation in which OE2 of Glu points away from the ligand. In TrypTIM, swung-in and swung-out conformations were observed for G3P and 3PG complexes, respectively. It was suggested that only the swungin conformation is suitable for catalysis. However, in PfTIM± 3PG and PfTIM±G3P, 11 of Glu165 is À55 and À59 , respectively, and OE2 points towards an invariant water molecule which in turn interacts with the ligand. Another notable difference is the contribution of the adjacent subunit to the ligand-binding interaction in PfTIM. The residues Ser73±Tyr74 of PfTIM are Ala73±Phe74 in most other TIM sequences. This natural substitution in PfTIM seems to compensate for the loss of hydrogen bonding from the ¯exible loop (from Gly171 NH). In both the subunits of PfTIM±3PG complex, the side-chain OH of Ser73 originating from the twofold-related subunit of the physiological TIM dimer interacts through a water molecule with one of the phosphate O atoms. This interaction is also seen in the high-resolution Ê (1.1 A) structure of 2-phosphoglycerate complexed with the malarial enzyme (unpublished results). Thus, this intersubunit interaction in the ligand-bound forms seems to be an invariant feature of the different inhibitor complexes of PfTIM; presumably, it is a compensating interaction in the open-loop form of the ligand±protein complex. 3.4.2. Conformation of the flexible loop. The most notable feature of the structures of the PfTIM±ligand complexes is that the catalytic loop (loop 6) remains in the open conformation. This is in sharp contrast to the structures of the complexes of the same ligand with TrypTIM, where loop 6 is closed and makes key contacts with the inhibitor (Noble et al., 1991). The most signi®cant interactions between the residues on the ¯exible loop and the ligands in the TrypTIM complexes are a hydrogen bond between Gly173 NH (TrypTIM numbering) and one of the phosphate O atoms and a hydrophobic interaction involving Ile172. Fig. 5 shows the relative positions of the ¯exible loops of Pf and TrypTIM after superposition of their corresponding C atoms. Also shown is the active site of the 3PG-bound TrypTIM. Movement of the TrypTIM loop towards the ligand is clearly seen. The loop sequence between the two enzymes is conserved except for Leu167 in PfTIM, which is Val169 in TrypTIM. The maximum Ê deviation of 7.0 A is observed for Gly173 (PfTIM numbering).  The C atoms of two residues, Ile172 and Gly173 of TrypTIM, which are involved in van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the ligand, are at distances of 3.19 and Ê 5.64 A, respectively, after superposition. 3.4.3. Implications for inhibitor design. Discussions on the mechanistic features of TIM catalysis have generally implicated loop closure as an important determinant of enzymatic activity (Knowles, 1991). The closure of the loop is believed to be essential for preventing phosphate elimination leading to the formation of the toxic product methylglyoxal (Pompliano et al., 1990). Why does PfTIM appear to favour the loop-open conformation in the ligand-bound states? The presence of Phe96 appears to be a cause, since this residue would come

into direct steric contact with Ile172 if Phe is modelled into the loop-closed form of TrypTIM. Fig. 6 shows the relative position of the closed loop of TrypTIM±3PG with respect to the active site of PfTIM. Also shown is the active-site helix region of PfTIM containing residue 96, which is Phe in PfTIM and Ser in other TIM sequences. Loop closure leads to severe steric clash between Ile172 and the bulky Phe96 of PfTIM, as can been seen from the overlap of the van der Waals surfaces (Fig. 6) of these residues, presumably destabilizing the closed conformation and making the loop closure less favourable when compared with other TIMs. Clearly, closure of the loop is not important for ligand binding. The striking structural differences in the enzyme±inhibitor complexes obtained for PfTIM appear to be correlated with the presence of Phe at position 96. Indeed, the Ser96Phe mutation is observed only in the parasite enzyme, while TIMs from all the other species have a conserved Ser at this position. Interestingly, the Ser96Phe mutation is also observed in the sequences of triosephosphate isomerases from P. berghei, P. yeoli, P. knowlesi, P. chabandi and P. vivax. The PfTIM gene with the Ser96Phe mutation has also been identi®ed in the whole genome sequence of P. falciparum (http:// www.sanger.ac.uk). This raises the possibility that speci®c lowmolecular-weight inhibitors might be targeted selectively to the active site of the Plasmodium enzymes. Inspection of Fig. 6 suggests that the OH group at the C2 atom of 3PG is closest to Phe96 (the distance between O3 of 3PG and CD1 and CE1 Ê atoms of Phe96 are 4.00 and 3.48 A, respectively). Therefore, it is likely that a suitable substitution at the C2 position of 3PG, which may promote interaction with the aromatic residue, might serve as a lead for the design of parasiteenzyme speci®c inhibitors. Interestingly, a recent study using a general computer-docking procedure with the coordinates of the unliganded open conformation of PfTIM reveals that several positively charged aromatic dyes might bind at the active site and interact with the unique Phe96 resdiue (Joubert et al., 2001). These dyes are also found to be good inhibitors of the malarial enzyme. complexes described elsewhere suggest that loop-open conformations are speci®cally favoured in the case of the parasite enzyme both in the free and ligand-bound states. It is likely that the S96F mutation in the malarial enzyme destabilizes the closed form, permitting trapping of the ligandbound loop-open states in crystals. The observation of a ligand-bound loop-closed conformation in one of the crystal forms of the PfTIM±PG complex (Parthasarathy et al., personal communication) suggests that loop closure is not completely impeded in the parasite enzyme but is possible if conformational adjustments are made at residues Phe96 and Leu167. These observations are consistent with the observed activity of the parasite enzyme. Further, these structures suggest that selective targeting of the loop-open state by speci®c inhibitors may be possible, providing an avenue to inhibit the parasite enzyme without affecting the corresponding enzyme in the human host.

4. Conclusions
Although extensively discussed in the literature (Hermes et al., 1990), there is no consensus on the importance of the conserved residue at position 96 in TIM catalysis (Alber et al., 1987). Structural analysis of a phosphoglycohydroxamate Ê (PGH) complex of chicken TIM Ser96Pro mutant at 1.9 A resolution revealed altered water structure within the activesite cavity. The activity of the mutant enzyme was 20-fold lower than that of the wild type (Zhang et al., 1999). However, replacement of Ser at position 96 by Phe in the Plasmodium enzyme does not impair its catalytic activity (Singh et al., 2001). NMR studies of yeast TIM suggest a dynamic equilibrium between loop-open and loop-closed forms of the enzyme in solution (Williams & McDermott, 1995). The structures of the two PfTIM±inhibitor complexes described here together with the structure of the PfTIM±phosphoglyclolate (PfTIM±PG)
