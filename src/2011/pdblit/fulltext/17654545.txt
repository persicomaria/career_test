ABSTRACT BtDyP from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (strain VPI-5482) and TyrA from Shewanella oneidensis are dye-decolorizing peroxidases (DyPs), members of a new family of heme-dependent peroxidases recently identified in fungi and bacteria. Here, we report the crystal structures of BtDyP and ° TyrA at 1.6 and 2.7 A, respectively. BtDyP assembles into a hexamer, while TyrA assembles into a dimer; the dimerization interface is conserved between the two proteins. Each monomer exhibits a two-domain, a1b ferredoxin-like fold. A site for heme binding was identified computationally, and modeling of a heme into the proposed active site allowed for

identification of residues likely to be functionally important. Structural and sequence comparisons with other DyPs demonstrate a conservation of putative heme-binding residues, including an absolutely conserved histidine. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments confirm heme binding, but with a stoichiometry of 0.3:1 (heme:protein).

INTRODUCTION Heme peroxidases oxidize a wide variety of substrates via an iron-oxo intermediate in a two electron process, wherein hydrogen peroxide is reduced to water with concomitant oxidization of the substrate. These ubiquitous enzymes have been isolated from animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi. Based on their ancestral origin, heme peroxidases were originally divided into two superfamilies, namely, the animal peroxidases1,2 and the plant peroxidases, which include fungal and bacterial peroxidases.3 The plant peroxidase superfamily has been further subdivided into three classes based on biological origin and sequence and structural similarity.3 Class I plant peroxidases are of prokaryotic lineage and include yeast cytochrome c peroxidase,4 class II are secretory fungal peroxidases5 and include lignin peroxidase (LiP)6 and manganese peroxidase (MnP), and class III are classical plant peroxidases, such as horseradish peroxidase.7,8 Pfam04261, the dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DyP) family, constitutes a novel class of peroxidase. Canonical members of this family include DyP from Thanatephorus cucumeris Dec 1 (formerly called Geotrichum candidum Dec 1)9 and TAP from Termitomyces albuminosus.10 Because these enzymes were derived from fungal sources, the DyP family was thought to be structurally related to the class II secretory fungal peroxidases. However, the DyP family exhibits only low sequence similarity to classical fungal peroxidases, such as LiP and MnP, and does not contain the conserved proximal and distal histidines and essential arginine found in other plant peroxidase superfamily members.3 The DyP family is also structurally divergent from all classes of the plant and animal peroxidase superfamilies. Recently, other proteins from prokaryotes and archaea have been identified as members of the DyP family based on sequence similarity, and this family has been expanded in the Pfam database11 to include 159 members. The DyP family thus constitutes a novel class of peroxidases and structural studies were undertaken to understand the biological role of these enzymes. BtDyP from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (strain VPI5482) has a molecular weight of 35,025 Da (residues 1­ 316) and a calculated isoelectric point of 4.9. TyrA from Shewanella oneidensis has a molecular weight of 35,758 Da (1­311) and a calculated isoelectric point of 5.1. Here, we report the crystal structures of BtDyP (PDB accession code 2gvk) and TyrA (PDB accession code 2hag), determined using the semiautomated, highthroughput pipeline of the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (JCSG),12 which is part of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)-funded Protein Structure Initiative (PSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein production and crystallization

BtDyP (GenBank: NP_810132.1; GI: 29346629) and TyrA (GenBank: NP_716371.1; GI: 24372329) were pro-

duced and crystallized as follows. The gene encoding each protein was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA using PfuTurbo (Stratagene) and primers corresponding to the predicted 50 and 30 ends. The PCR product was cloned into plasmid pSpeedET, which encodes an expression and purification tag followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site (MGSDKIHHHHHHENLYFQG) at the amino terminus of the full-length protein. The cloning junctions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein expression was performed in a selenomethionine-containing medium using the Escherichia coli strain GeneHogs (Invitrogen). At the end of fermentation, lysozyme was added to the culture to a final concentration of 250 mg/mL, and the cells were harvested. After one freeze­thaw cycle, the cells were sonicated in Lysis Buffer [50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)], and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 32,500 3 g for 30 min. The soluble fraction was loaded onto nickel-chelating resin (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with Lysis Buffer, the resin was washed with Wash Buffer [50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP], and the protein was eluted with Elution Buffer [20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 300 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP]. The eluate was buffer exchanged with HEPES Crystallization Buffer [20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, 1 mM TCEP] and treated with 1 mg of TEV protease per 10 mg of eluted protein. The digested eluate was passed over nickel-chelating resin (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with HEPES Crystallization Buffer, the resin was washed with the same buffer, and the flow-through and wash fractions were combined. BtDyP was concentrated to 17.7 mg/mL by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Millipore), while TyrA was concentrated to 15.5 mg/mL. The proteins were crystallized using the nanodroplet vapor diffusion method13 with standard JCSG crystallization protocols.12 The crystallization reagent for BtDyP contained 2.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M acetate pH 4.5, and 0.2 M Li2SO4. Ethylene glycol was added as a cryoprotectant to a final concentration of 17% (v/v). For TyrA, the crystallization reagent contained 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) 2-propanol, and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000. Glycerol was added as a cryoprotectant to a final concentration of 10% (v/v). Initial screening for diffraction was carried out using the Stanford Automated Mounting system (SAM)14 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) (Stanford, CA). The BtDyP crystals were indexed in hexagonal space group P6322 (Table I), while the TyrA crystals were indexed in tetragonal space group P43212 (Table II). Molecular weight and oligomeric state of BtDyP and TyrA were determined using a 1 cm 3 30 cm Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in combination with static light scattering (Wyatt Technology). The mobile phase consisted of 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide.

Data collection, structure solution, and refinement

Multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data for BtDyP and TyrA were collected on SSRL beamlines 9-2 and 11-1, respectively, at wavelengths corresponding to the inflection, high energy remote, and absorption peak of a selenium MAD experiment. The BtDyP data sets were collected at 100 K on a MarMosaic 325 CCD detector (Mar USA) using the BLU-ICE15 data collection environment. The MAD data were integrated and reduced using XDS16 and then scaled with the program XSCALE.16 MAD phasing and density modification were accomplished with SOLVE17 and RESOLVE.18 Automatic model building with ARP/wARP19 traced 305 of 317 (0, 1­316) residues. Model completion and refinement were performed with the inflection wavelength data (k1) in COOT20 and REFMAC5,21 respectively. Data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The TyrA data sets were collected at 100 K using

an ADSC Q315 CCD detector using the BLU-ICE data collection environment. The MAD data were integrated and reduced using XDS and then scaled with the program XSCALE. The MAD data were phased with SOLVE. The best automated trace obtained with RESOLVE included 217 residues (70%); however, side chains were built for only 122 of these residues. An automated program (H. van den Bedem, unpublished) to build a consensus model from multiple RESOLVE and ARP/wARP traces improved the trace to 260 residues (84%), with 255 of the side chains built. In order to improve the starting phases for TyrA, the structure of BtDyP was used as a molecular replacement model. The combined molecular replacement and experimental phases were used for model building. Completion and refinement of the model were performed with the inflection wavelength data (k1) in COOT and REFMAC5, respectively. Data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table II.

Validation and deposition

Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the models was accomplished using AutoDepInputTool,24 MolProbity,25 SFcheck 4.0,22 and WHATIF 5.0.26 Protein quaternary structure analysis was performed using the PQS server.27 Figure 1 was adapted from an analysis using PDBsum,28 Figure 3 was prepared using ESPript,29 and all other figures were prepared with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). Atomic coordinates and experimental structure factors for BtDyP from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ° at 1.60 A resolution and TyrA from Shewanella oneidensis ° at 2.75 A have been deposited in the PDB and are accessible under the codes 2gvk and 2hag, respectively.

Isothermal titration calorimetry

All titrations were performed in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 150 mM NaCl. Hemin (BioChemika) solutions were freshly prepared prior to

each titration to minimize heme aggregation. Hemin was dissolved in a minimal volume of 0.1 N NaOH, diluted to 10 mM with buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 150 mM NaCl), and centrifuged; the pH was adjusted with hydrochloric acid. The concentration of hemin was measured using an e385(0.1 N NaOHaq) value of 58,440 M21 cm21.30 Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was performed with an Omega titration calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA) as described previously.31 BtDyP and TyrA were dialyzed overnight in the buffer, and the dialysates were used to prepare hemin/protein solutions. Typically, 200 lM hemin solution was added to 30 lM protein (present in the sample cell, volume 5 1.34 mL) as a 2lL injection followed by twenty 8- to 10-lL injections, using a syringe rotating at 400 rpm. An interval of 4 min between successive injections was given to allow the baseline to stabilize. All titrations were carried out at 258C. One of the requirements for determining binding constants in an Omega calorimeter is that the C values lie

data so obtained were fitted via the nonlinear leastsquares minimization method to determine binding stoichiometry (n), association constant (Kb), and change in 0 enthalpy of binding (DHb ), using Origin software 0 (Microcal). The change in free energy of binding (DGb ) 0 was calculated using DGb 5 2RT 3 lnKb, where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin. Thermodynamic quantities so obtained were used to determine 0 0 the change in entropy (DS) using DGb 5 DHb 2 TDS.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The crystal structures of two DyP family members, BtDyP and TyrA (Fig. 1), were determined to 1.60 and ° 2.75 A resolution, respectively, using the MAD method. Data collection, model, and refinement statistics for BtDyP and TyrA are summarized in Tables I and II, respectively. The final model for BtDyP includes one protein monomer (residues 8­316), one Na1 ion, five 1,2ethanediol molecules, three Cl2 ions, two acetate molecules, and one unknown ligand (UNL). The protein was expressed with a cleavable expression and purification tag. After cleavage with TEV protease, the cleavage site glycine residue preceding the target sequence remains. No electron density was observed for this glycine residue (0) or for BtDyP residues 1­7 (Fig. 1). The side chains of Lys19, Lys95, Lys98, Lys115, Lys132, Glu224, Asn236, and Lys255 had poor electron density and were not modeled. ° The Matthews' coefficient (Vm)32 is 3.0 A3 Da21, and the estimated solvent content is 59%. The Ramachandran plot produced by MolProbity33 shows that 98% and 100% of the residues are in favored and allowed regions, respectively, with no outliers. Analysis of the crystallographic packing indicates that a hexamer is the most likely oligomerization state [Fig. 2(B)]. This finding is consistent with results from analytical size exclusion chromatography coupled with static light scattering, which gave a molecular weight of 220 kDa. The final model for TyrA includes one protein monomer (residues 5­311) and 48 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. No electron density was observed for residue Gly0 from the expression/purification tag, which remained after TEV protease cleavage, and for residues 1­4. The side chains of residues Asn5, Ser34, Asp127, Glu154, Lys157, Arg159, Glu233, Lys236, Ile238, Lys269, and Asn311 were in regions of poor electron density and not modeled. The Matthews' coefficient (Vm)32 for TyrA ° is 3.5 A3 Da21, and the estimated solvent content is 65%. The Ramachandran plot produced by MolProbity33 shows that 95.4% and 100% of the residues are in favored and allowed regions, respectively, with no outliers. Analysis of the crystallographic packing of TyrA indicates that a dimer is the biologically relevant form [Fig. 2(C)]. This finding is consistent with results from analytical size exclusion chromatography in combination

Multiple sequence alignment of BtDyP and related peroxidases: The secondary structural elements and sequences of BtDyP and TT1485 were aligned to TyrA, DyP, YcdB, and TAP sequences using FFAS34 and ClustalW,35 and coloring was done using ESPript.29 Sequence identity to BtDyP is 33% for TyrA, 14.5% for DyP, 14.3% for TAP, 15.2% for YcdB, and 12.1% for TT1485. The sequences are BtDyP from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (PDB code 2gvk), TyrA from Shewanella oneidensis (PDB code 2hag), YcdB from Escherichia coli (gi: 26247042), DyP from Thanatephorus cucumeris Dec 1 (PDB code 2d3q), TAP from Termitomyces albuminosus (gi: 20386144), and TT1485 from Thermus thermophilus (PDB code 1vdh). The secondary structure of BtDyP and TT1485 is depicted above and below the sequence alignment, respectively. Residues highlighted in yellow correspond to the dimerization interface of BtDyP and TyrA, while those in pink are involved in putative heme binding, with the catalytic histidine boxed in red. Residues highlighted in orange are at the hexamerization interface of BtDyP. Residue H164 of DyP, which was previously suggested to be the active site histidine, is circled in red.

with static light scattering, which gave a molecular weight of 71.0 kDa. BtDyP and TyrA are two-domain, a1b proteins, with each domain adopting a ferredoxin-like fold. The proteins consist of an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain likely to be related by a duplication of an ancestral gene, as inferred from the conserved topology of the domains. The two-layered fold consists of a fourstranded, antiparallel b-sheet sandwiched by a-helices. The two b-sheets, comprised of b-strands 2, 5, 1, and 6, and 8, 9, 7, and 10, form a b-barrel motif. BtDyP and TyrA each contain ten b-strands, ten a-helices, and two 310-helices (Fig. 1). BtDyP and TyrA exhibit the same dimerization interface, which buries $10% of the total surface area. The predominantly hydrophobic dimerization interface consists of a loop between b-strands 8 and 9 that penetrates a groove formed by H4 and b6, with an additional, smaller interface formed between H6 and H4. Unlike TyrA, BtDyP further associates to form a hexamer (trimer of dimers). The total buried surface for BtDyP ° upon hexamerization is 17,864 A2, or 28% of the sol° vent accessible surface area of 63,961 A2. Residues buried via hexamerization are predominantly hydrophobic

and are scattered throughout the primary sequence (Figs. 2 and 3). Proteins structurally related to BtDyP and TyrA, including TT1485 (PDB accession code 1vdh) from Thermus thermophilus HB836 and a putative chlorite dismutase from Bacillus stearothermophilus (PDB accession code 1t0t), exhibit a highly conserved tertiary structure [Fig. 2(A)], but their quaternary structures are more varied. For example, TT1485 and the putative chlorite dismutase form pentamers, compared to a hexamer for BtDyP and a dimer for TyrA. Furthermore, DyP family members DyP9 and TAP10 are monomeric. Sequence alignments demonstrate that some residues involved in oligomerization in BtDyP are adjacent to insertions in DyP and TAP (Fig. 3). These insertions may influence the quaternary structure of the protein, with insertions favoring a monomeric form. The role of oligomerization and whether it relates to catalytic function in BtDyP and TyrA remains to be investigated. The putative active site for BtDyP and TyrA, based on an examination of available cavities and conserved motifs, is not located at the oligomerization interfaces; thus the monomer appears to be catalytically competent (Fig. 4).

Heme binding

The concentrated protein solutions of BtDyP and TyrA were faintly orange in color, and a weak Soret peak was noted at 410 nm, suggesting that some heme was present. The Reinheitzahl (RZ) value for the proteins was $0.18, based on scans at 410 and 280 nm, denoting the presence of a low level of heme. The low heme:protein ratio in the purified proteins and the absence of electron density corresponding to heme in the structures of BtDyP and TyrA are most likely due to the protein expression conditions. In order to confirm and quantify heme binding, ITC experiments were performed. Thermodynamic constants for heme binding were determined, with DH 5 28.2 (Æ0.8) kcal mol21, DS 5 3.3 (Æ2.4) cal mol21 K21, DG

5 29.3 (Æ0.1) kcal mol21, and Kb 5 6.3 (Æ0.9) 3 106 M21 for BtDyP. The overall binding of heme to BtDyP is exothermic and energetically favorable. The slight increase in entropy most likely denotes that little conformational change is necessary for heme binding. For TyrA, values of DH 5 216.0 (Æ2.3) kcal mol21, DS 5 220.6 (Æ5.8) cal mol21 K21, DG 5 29.8 (Æ0.5) kcal mol21, and Kb 5 2.0 (Æ1.4) 3 107 M21 were obtained. Overall, the binding of heme to TyrA was exothermic and energetically favorable, but the entropy decreased upon heme binding. This decrease in entropy is likely due to conformational changes in which active site residues become more ordered upon heme binding. The stoichiometric ratio of heme:protein was estimated at 0.3:1 for both proteins (Fig. 5). This ratio is similar to results obtained for TT1485 in which only three monomers in the pentamer were thought to bind heme.36 The stoichiometric ratio suggests that only one monomer in the TyrA dimer and two or three monomers in the BtDyP hexamer bind heme. The less than 1:1 ratio of heme:protein may be due to poor protein stability during the ITC measurements, underestimated heme concentration, or allosteric effects blocking heme binding in the oligomer. We have now investigated the heme binding structurally and biochemically to determine whether sequestration of heme in one monomer engenders conformational changes in the protein that affect heme binding in the partner polypeptide(s).37 Examination of potential active site cavities using Q-SiteFinder38 showed that a solvent-filled cavity near His231 in BtDyP and His224 in TyrA is the most likely location of the active site. Also, in the crystal structure of BtDyP, density for an unknown ligand (UNL) in the tunnel leading to this cavity was observed. Taken together, these data allowed tentative identification of the active site in BtDyP and TyrA. Extensive structural and sequence comparisons to DyP family members further support the identification of the heme-binding active site based on an absolutely conserved histidine residue and other highly conserved residues likely involved in heme binding. In order to further investigate potential heme-binding motifs, we used the higher resolution BtDyP structure to perform modeling studies (Fig. 4). Coordinates for a heme molecule were obtained from the high-resolution crystal structure of heme-bound horseradish peroxidase (PDB accession code 1atj), and initial positioning of the heme in BtDyP was based on superposition of the active site histidine residue with the proximal histidine in the horseradish peroxidase structure. After manual rotations to minimize steric clashes, while maintaining a His-Fe° bonding distance of $2.1 A, residues potentially involved in sequestration of heme were identified. Sequence alignments demonstrate that the putative heme-binding site contains a number of highly conserved residues in the DyP family (Fig. 3). In addition to the proximal His231,

ITC data for BtDyP and TyrA: (A) Representative isothermal titration calorimetric profile for the binding of heme to BtDyP. The raw data were obtained after a single, 2-mL injection followed by 8-mL injections of 200 mM hemin solution into 30 mM BtDyP in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, containing 150 mM NaCl at 258C (top). Nonlinear least-squares fit (2) of the heat released as a function of the added ligand (n) is also shown (bottom). The data were fitted to a single-site model.

a highly conserved Asp289 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the histidine, forming a potential Fe-His-Asp triad commonly seen in peroxidases such as cytochrome c peroxidase.39 An electrostatic interaction between the propionate moieties of the heme and the conserved arginine, Arg245, may help position the heme in the active ° site. Asp157, which is $5 A from the iron center of the heme moiety, may be an important distal residue involved in peroxide binding during catalysis and may act in a manner similar to a glutamate residue in chloroperoxidase.40 Aromatic residues line the active site, including highly conserved Phe155, Tyr192, Trp199, and Phe262, and likely provide a favorable hydrophobic environment for heme binding. Based on biochemical and mutagenesis studies of DyP, a different histidine residue (His164 in mature DyP or His220 in the full-length alignment) was proposed to provide a heme-iron ligand.41 While our sequence and structural comparisons of the putative active sites of BtDyP, TyrA, TT1485, and other DyP family members all contain a conserved histidine in the active site, it does not correspond to His164 of DyP (Fig. 3). His164 in DyP corresponds to Lys150 in BtDyP and is located on a loop between b-strand b6 and helix H5 in BtDyP. This residue does not contribute to the putative active site

defined in our study and is not conserved as a histidine in the DyP family of proteins (Figs. 1 and 3). YcdB, a heme-binding DyP family peroxidase from E. coli, also lacks a histidine at the DyP position 164, but contains the conserved histidine identified in this study and is postulated to be a heme-binding ligand.42 Recently, the coordinates for heme-bound DyP were released (PDB accession code 2d3q) and the JCSG has also determined a heme-bound structure of TyrA (PDB accession code 2iiz).37 Based on structural comparisons, the model of heme binding for BtDyP presented here is in agreement with these newly available structural data, confirming that His231 of BtDyP acts as an axial ligand in heme binding. Detailed structural comparisons of the apo and heme-bound forms of TyrA are presented in a companion paper.37

CONCLUSIONS A conserved histidine residue (His231) in the active site of BtDyP aligns with His224 in TyrA, His364 in fulllength DyP, and His172 in TT1485. A sequence alignment of all 159 Pfam members of the DyP family demonstrates complete conservation of this histidine, which

serves as a ligand for heme binding. These initial structural studies of BtDyP and TyrA, members of the DyP family, have allowed the identification of the active site based on structural and sequence comparisons to related proteins. Further crystallographic and biochemical characterization of this novel class of peroxidase is important to fully understand its heme-binding motifs, substrate preferences, and catalytic mechanism. The DyP protein family contains several homologous sequences distributed amongst bacteria, fungi, and archaea. Homology models for these proteins based on the structures of 2gvk and 2hag can be accessed at http:// www1.jcsg.org/cgi-bin/models/get_mor.pl?key52gvkA and http://www1.jcsg.org/cgi-bin/models/get_mor.pl?key5 2hagA, respectively.
