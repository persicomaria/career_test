Abstract High-resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of HIV-1 protease clinical variants complexed with licensed inhibitors are essential to understanding the fundamental cause of protease drug resistance. There is a need for structures of naturally evolved HIV-1 proteases from patients failing antiretroviral therapy. Here, we report the expression, purification, and crystallization of clinical isolates of HIV-1 protease that have been characterized to be more than 100 times less susceptible to US FDA approved protease inhibitors. ” 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

The HIV-1 protease is one of the two targets for licensed drug design therapies and is the focus of intense scientific study [1≠4]. Protease inhibitors interfere with the cleavage of the viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors that are required for the production of infectious viral particles. In spite of the fact that treatment with inhibitors has extended the life expectancy of HIV/ AIDS patients, treatment efficacy is time-limited. Mutations along the HIV genome develop rapidly due to the lack of proofreading ability of the HIV reverse transcriptase [5≠7]. Each chain of the ``native'' HIV protease dimer is 99 residues long and about two-thirds of the protease can mutate. There is an extensive body of information about the binding of dozens of different compounds to the ``native'' HIV protease [8≠11]. In contrast, there is a scarcity of published structural information about the binding of multi-drug resistant HIV protease from clinical isolates to US FDA approved inhibitors. There are crystallographic studies of HIV protease where selected resistance mutations were

introduced by recombinant DNA technology. To our knowledge, this is the first report of expression, purification, and crystallization of multi-drug resistant HIV protease clinical isolates containing 7≠10 amino acid substitutions conferring resistance from one to several of the licensed inhibitors [12]. The purpose of the present work was to express, purify, and crystallize a chosen set of clinical isolates from patients failing antiretroviral therapy [12]. Crystallographic study of MDR HIV protease-inhibitor complexes will help to understand the changes in molecular recognition, leading to therapy failure.

The final antibiotic concentration in the culture medium was 100 lg/ml ampicillin. When double selection was needed, spectinomycin was added at 50 lg/ml to the ampicillin-containing culture medium. These antibiotic concentrations were used for all protein expression experiments. The transformation procedure consisted of 100 ll competent E. coli cells [14] mixed with 50≠250 ng purified plasmid DNA, placed in a sterile, pre-chilled 1.5 ml

microcentrifuge tube, and incubated for 20 min on ice. For heat shock, the mixture containing the plasmid and competent cells was then placed at 37 ∞C for 90 s. After the heat shock step, the tube was incubated on ice for 2 min. Subsequently, 1 ml YT medium was added to the tube and incubated for 30 min with shaking at 37 ∞C. After incubation, the cells were spun down, resuspended in 100 ll YT medium, and then plated onto YT ampicillin plates. The same procedure was used for co-transformation with the plasmid harboring the HIV protease variant and a second helper plasmid pSJS1240 [15], with the exception that the cells were plated on YT agar medium containing both ampicillin and spectinomycin. Multiple drug resistant HIV-1 isolates The HIV protease clinical isolates were obtained from four patients (3761, 1385, 807, and 769; Fig. 1) who had received extensive and long-term multi-drug antiretroviral therapy. The multiple drug resistant clinical protease variants containing a series of amino acid changes from the NL4-3 wild-type were obtained from a collection at the Center for AIDS Research (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). The in vitro drug susceptibility assays were performed as reported earlier (Table 1).

Expression and refolding of hexahistidine tagged HIV protease Growth of the bacterial culture was monitored over time using freshly transformed E. coli strain BL21(DE3) with the appropriate HIV protease clinical isolate in pRSETB expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A 20 ml YT liquid medium with ampicillin was inoculated with a single colony of freshly transformed cells.

The YT culture medium in a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube was incubated at 37 ∞C in a shaking incubator (Barnstead/Thermolyne, Dubuque, Iowa) set at 220 rpm and the bacterial culture grew 2≠3 h until mid-log phase. The mid-log phase bacteria were used to inoculate 1 L of YT ampicillin medium. The culture was induced at an absorbance (A600 ) of 0.4≠0.6 with 1 mM IPTG and the bacterial culture grew for another 3 h post-induction. Cultured cells were harvested by centrifugation in a Sorvall SLA1500 rotor at 10,000g for 5 min at 4 ∞C. The cell pellet was cleaned once with wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM 2mercaptoethanol, and 2 mM EDTA) and the pellet was suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mM sodium chloride, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). At this time, the bacterial suspension was lysed using 20,000 psi by passing twice through a 1 in. diameter French pressure cell. The inclusion bodies formed by the HIV protease were immediately separated from the soluble protein fraction by centrifugation at 38,000g for 30 min at 4 ∞C. The HIV-1 protease inclusion bodies were solubilized using lysis buffer containing 6 M urea. The solubilized protease sample was applied to a Probond nickel affinity column (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which had been preequilibrated with lysis buffer containing 6 M urea. The protease was eluted from the affinity column using a series of washes with increasing amounts of imidazole (Fig. 2). The purified protease fractions were pooled and acidified with 10% trifluoroacetic acid to a pH 6 4. Denatured protease was placed for dialysis into a bag with a 3500 molecular weight cut-off and dialyzed against a solution of 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, 1 M urea, and

1 mM DTT, followed by three changes of 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5, 1 mM DTT. The resulting protease sample was concentrated to 5≠6 mg/ml using a Centriprep YM-3 concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA) at 3000g at 4 ∞C. D25N mutation of the catalytic residue To overcome autoproteolysis of the wild-type and MDR HIV-1 proteases (Fig. 3) during refolding and concentration, the catalytic residue aspartate 25 was changed to the structurally similar and catalytically inert asparagine. The mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to manufacturer’s instructions, in conjunction with the mutagenic oligonucleotides: 50 D25NL (AAAGGAAGCTCTATTAAATACAGGA GCAGATGATACAGTATT) and 30 D25NL (AATAC TGTATCATCTGCTCCTGTATTTAATAGAGCTTC CTTT). The presence of the D25N mutation was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (DNA Core Facility, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI). Removal of the hexahistidine tag A hexahistidine tagged HIV protease precipitated from all buffers routinely used for protein crystallization, except sodium acetate at pH 5. Therefore, the N-terminal tag was removed by mutating five bases immediately upstream from the HIV protease coding domain to form an NdeI restriction enzyme site, using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic oligonucleotides used

were 50 NdeHIV (GACGATGACGATAAGGATCCG AGCCATATGCCTCAGATCACTCTTTGGCAACG ACCC) and 30 NdeHIV (GGGTCGTTGCCAAAGAG TGATCTGAGGCATATGGCTCGGATCCTTATCG TCATCGTC). Restriction digest with NdeI resulted in the removal from the expression plasmid of a 100 bp DNA fragment containing the segment with the hexahistidine tag. The shortened expression vector was religated at 16 ∞C using a standard molecular biology protocol [16] after agarose gel purification. Purification and refolding of HIV protease lacking hexahistidine tag A cell pellet from 1 L of YT medium was washed and resuspended in 30 ml buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 8, 25 mM sodium chloride, and 0.2% of 2-mercaptoethanol). The bacterial suspension was then subjected to 20,000 psi pressure by passing twice through a 1 in. diameter French pressure cell. The lysed bacterial mixture was then centrifuged at 4 ∞C for 20 min at 38,000g in a fixed angle rotor. The supernatant was immediately removed from the cellular debris containing the HIV protease inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were washed with a series of 30 ml buffer A solutions (buffer A only, buffer A with 0.2% Triton X-100, buffer A with 1 M sodium chloride, and buffer A with 1 M urea) [17], followed by a 20 min centrifugation at 38,000g at 4 ∞C between each step. After the final washing step, the protease inclusion bodies were solubilized using buffer A containing 6 M urea incubating for 30 min at room temperature. A final centrifugation at 38,000g was performed before applying the sample to a Q-Sepharose ion exchange column pre-equilibrated with buffer A with 6 M urea. The

flowthrough from the ion exchange column contained the purified HIV protease (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3). For refolding, the purified protease was diluted to a concentration between 0.1and 0.2 mg/ml with buffer A containing 6 M urea. The diluted, purified HIV protease was dialyzed against 4 L of 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 25 mM sodium chloride, 0.2% of 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, followed by two changes of 4 L of 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 25 mM sodium chloride, and 0.2% of 2-mercaptoethanol, followed by two volume changes with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6, 0.2% of 2-mercaptoethanol and one volume change of 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.6, 10 mM DTT. Precipitates were removed by centrifugation at 27,000g for 20 min after dialysis. The diluted protein samples were concentrated to 3≠5 mg/ml at 4 ∞C using a Centriprep YM-3 at 3000g. Monitoring the expression of HIV-1 protease by SDS gel analysis Five ml cell cultures harboring different HIV-1 variant protease plasmids were incubated at 37 ∞C with shaking for 12 h. One ml cell culture samples were removed and placed into microfuge tubes for SDS≠PAGE analysis. The 1 ml samples were spun at 12,000g for 3≠5 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, the medium was completely removed from the bacterial pellet using a micropipettor. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 ll of 2¬ SDS≠PAGE sample loading buffer [18]. The resuspended mixture was incubated for 10 min at 95 ∞C. Five microliter samples were loaded on 4≠20% gradient SDS≠ PAGE gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue solution for 15≠20 min, followed by destaining with a solution containing 20% acetic acid and 20% methanol.

Results Expression of MDR HIV-1 protease containing two isoleucine AUA codons in tandem It was surprising to observe an absence of protease expression of certain MDR mutants as opposed to others especially considering the effectiveness of the T7 promoter system in conjunction with the E. coli expression strain BL21(DE3). HIV protease sequence analysis showed the presence in tandem of rare E. coli isoleucine codons AUA (Fig. 5). There was a direct correlation between the lack of protein production and the presence of this codon in tandem. Therefore, a ready supply of this rare E. coli isoleucine tRNA should allow protease expression to occur. We tested this hypothesis by performing a co-transformation of the protease expression plasmid with the helper plasmid containing the tRNA for isoleucine. Expression of the HIV protease variants containing the isoleucine codons at positions 46 and 47 was restored in the presence of the tRNA helper plasmid (Fig. 6). The upper band (band A) on the SDS≠ PAGE gel is the protein coded by the selectable marker spectinomycin (Fig. 6). Expression and purification of recombinant HIV-1 protease containing hexahistidine tag To facilitate purification of multiple clinical isolates, we initially used a vector containing a hexahistidine tag under the control of the T7 promoter system using increasing amounts of imidazole for elution (Fig. 2, lane 8) [19]. However, after refolding and concentrating, the purified protease was found to be degraded and unsuitable for crystallization (Fig. 3, lane 2). Thus, it was necessary to eliminate the proteolytic activity by using site-directed mutagenesis with the mutagenic oligonucleotides to substitute the catalytically active aspartate

25 with an inert asparagine. This substitution completely eliminated the catalytic activity without significantly altering the size of the amino acid side chain at position 25. The D25N mutation also made possible the cocrystallization of the HIV protease clinical isolates with Gag and Gag-Pol substrates. Expression and purification of non-hexahistidine D25N HIV protease Although the protein variants were highly overexpressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3), the hexahistidine tag protease was unstable and sensitive to buffer changes. Precipitation of the wild-type and MDR HIV proteases containing the hexahistidine tag occurred anytime a buffer other than sodium acetate was used. Thus, a cloning strategy was developed to retain the overexpression capability without the large number of amino acids on the N-terminal end. The generation of the second NdeI site allowed the removal of the DNA segment coding for the hexahistidine tag. This deletion of the hexahistidine tag stabilized the protease for concentration and crystallization setups. The subsequent protein without the hexahistidine tag did not precipitate through typical crystallization setups and gave suitable crystals for structural analysis. Crystallization of MDR HIV protease clinical isolates Crystallization trials were performed by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 22 ∞C. The uncomplexed

HIV-1 protease crystals (Fig. 7B) formed within one week from 1 ll of purified protein mixed with an equal volume of precipitant (0.3≠1.0 M sodium chloride) in the pH range of 5.5≠7.5. The same crystal morphology was obtained for the HIV protease variants without the hexahistidine tag in the presence of various inhibitors and peptide substrate fragments. Purified MDR D25N HIV protease variants were incubated on ice with the ligand (substrate or licensed inhibitor) for a period of 30 min, followed by a 15-min centrifugation to clarify the solution. The crystals have a bipyramidal morphology with the dimensions 0:1 ¬ 0:1 ¬ 0:05 mm3 and dif fract X-rays beyond 2 A resolution at the synchrotron (Advanced Photon Source, DND-CAT ID5B, Chicago, IL).

Discussion There is an abundance of information about the crystal structure of ``native'' HIV protease with a large number of ligands [9≠11,20≠36]. However, there is little known about the structural evolution of the HIV-1 protease from patients on antiretroviral therapy. The rapid structural change is due to the lack of a proofreading mechanism during reverse transcription [5≠7,37] of the genome. Here, we report a study in expression, purification, and crystallization of prevalent clinical isolates from patients failing antiretroviral therapy. These isolates are either highly drug resistant or cross-resistant to many licensed inhibitors. Moreover, they are cross-resistant to many compounds under current development (Table 1). During the course of this work, we encountered a series of technical difficulties. Expression of HIV protease clinical isolates in E. coli was absent from clones containing two rare isoleucine codons in tandem. Another problem was the self-cleavage of the purified HIV

protease during refolding and concentration. Lastly, the hexahistidine tag caused excessive precipitation of the HIV-1 protease during purification and crystallization. Initially, it was unclear why some protease mutants were not expressed while others were expressed at high levels using the same T7 system. Careful examination of the HIV protease sequence revealed the presence of the rare E. coli isoleucine codon, AUA. This observation was confirmed by expression of the HIV protease clones with the aid of the tRNA helper plasmid. However, it is not the presence of the rare codons themselves but the presence of the rare codons in tandem that abolishes expression. Even though the hexahistidine tag was beneficial for the one-step purification process with the affinity column, the refolded protease was unstable to further manipulation necessary for crystallization. Heavy precipitation occurred during crystallization setups using small increments in pH and/or precipitants. Even a change from one buffer to another with the same pH caused considerable precipitation of the protein. Although crystals with the hexahistidine tag were eventually obtained, they took several months to crystallize, diffracted poorly, and were ill formed (Fig. 7A). Excessive precipitation due to the presence of the hexahistidine tag has also been observed for the ArsC protein (Dr. Barry Rosen, personal communication). In contrast, Bucher et al. [38] report identical properties for the maltodextrin binding protein with and without the affinity tag. Self-cleavage is a problem for purified proteases and is usually solved with different techniques. One solution is the introduction of stabilizing amino acid mutations at key positions within the protease that confer resistance to autoproteolysis [39,40]. A second option is storage in the presence of either a non-hydrolyzable substrate or a protease inhibitor. A third alternative is to alter a key catalytic residue, aspartate 25, to inactivate

the HIV protease. A conservative approach was to alter the catalytic residue, since a large amount of protease inhibitor would be required during protein purification and refolding. Alteration of the catalytic residue also makes possible the structural study of protease≠substrate complexes. The use of the D25N inactive variant for crystallographic studies was all ready reported [41]. In conclusion, there were various technical problems hindering the study of drug resistant HIV proteases from patients failing antiretroviral therapy. During expression, purification, and crystallization the major obstacles encountered were codon bias, autoproteolysis, and the presence of the hexahistidine tag. By overcoming these difficulties, it is now possible to study the changes in the binding of inhibitors to the rapidly evolving HIV protease, leading to antiviral treatment failure.
