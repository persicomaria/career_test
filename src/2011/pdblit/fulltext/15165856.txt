Summary
The chromogranins/secretogranins are a family of neuroendocrine vesicle secretory proteins. Immunohistology and immunoblotting have suggested that a major soluble protein in human chromaffin granules may be chromogranin B (CgB). We purified from pheochromocytoma chromaffin granules an SDS-PAGE 110-120 kDa protein whose N-terminal sequence matched that previously deduced from a human CgB cDNA. An antibody directed against a synthetic human CgB N-terminal region specifically recognized the CgB N-terminus, though not the chromogranin A (CgA) N-terminus or the CgB C-terminus on immunoblots. An antiserum directed against CgB's C-terminus also visualized CgB but not CgA. By immunoblotting, CgB was a quantitatively major protein in human pheochromocytoma chromaffin granules, but a relatively minor protein in normal bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin granules. In a variety of normal bovine neuroendocrine tissues, the relative abundance of CgB immunoreactivity on immunoblots was: adrenal medulla > anterior pituitary > pancreas > small intestine, hypothalamus. Immunoblotting of neuroendocrine tissues (or their hormone storage vesicle cores) with both anti N-terminal and anti C-terminal CgB antisera suggested bidirectional cleavage or processing of CgB; in the anterior pituitary, a unique 40 kDa C-terminal fragment was observed. Bidirectional CgB cleavage was also suggested on immunoblots of chromaffin tissue from three species (human, bovine, rat). C-terminal processing of CgB was also confn-med by amino acid sequencing of SDS-PAGECorrespondence: D.T. O'Connor, Nephrology/Hypertension(V-11l-H), VA Medical Center, San Diego, CA 92161, U.S.A.

Introduction

The chromogranins/secretogranins represent a family of acidic soluble proteins common to the cores of virtually all peptide and amine secretory granules in the neuroendocrine system [1,2]. Although chromogranin A (CgA), the heretofore best studied chromogranin, is the major soluble protein in bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin granules, in the human adrenal medulla chromogranin B (CgB) may rival CgA in quantitative predominance [3,4]. To extend our knowledge of CgB, we isolated it chromatographically from chromaffin granules of a human pheochromocytoma, and used its sequence information to design synthetic peptides, whose antisera identified CgB, its neuroendocrine tissue and species distribution, and its posttranslational processing.

Materials and Methods Hormone storage vesicles Chromaffin granules from normal bovine adrenal medulla and human pheochromocytoma were obtained from fresh tissue homogenates by sucrose density step gradient centrifugation as previously discussed [5,6]. Hormone storage vesicles of bovine anterior pituitary were obtained by differential centrifugation as previously described [7]. After granule lysis by freezing and thawing in 1 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) granule membranes were removed by centrifugation (6. 106g · min), leaving soluble core proteins in the supernate [ 5,6]. Proteins were quantitated by the Coomassie Blue dye binding method [8] and analyzed by one-dimensional S D S - P A G E [9] followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To assess tissue-specific cleavage of chromogranins prior to the possibility of postmortem proteolytic artifacts [3,4] during vesicle isolation, bovine neuroendocrine tissues (adrenal medulla, anterior pituitary, hypothalamus, small intestine (jejunoileum) and pancreas) were quickly frozen on dry ice immediately after death, then boiled in

Isolation of human chromogranin B from pheochromocytoma granules
Preliminary experiments with HPLC anion-exchange and gel permeation chromatography did not resolve CgB from CgA in granule lysates. Therefore, 235/~g of pheochromocytoma soluble core proteins were injected into a 4.6 × 250 mm Bio-Rad Hi-Pore C-4 silica reverse-phase column (model RP-304, Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) equilibrated in 0.1 7o trifluoracetic acid (TFA) in H20 at 0.75 ml/min. After 1.5 min, elution began with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (CH3CN) in 0.1 ~o TFA at 1 ml/min (see Fig. 1). Each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and purified proteins were concentrated by lyophilization and stored at - 2 0 ° C. CgB was also resolved from other pheochromocytoma chromaffin granule proteins (60 #g) by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, followed by electrophoretic transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) sheets, staining with amido black, storage at - 20 ° C, and microsequencing as described by Matsudaira [10].

Characteristics of chromogranin B
The RP-HPLC purified SDS molecular mass 110-120 kDa CgB (7.5 #g) or the PVDF-immobilized CgB or CgB-fragment bands were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems Model 470 Protein Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Model 120A) [11 ]. Based on the N-terminal sequence of human CgB, a hydropathy plot was generated by the method of Hopp and Woods [12].

Synthetic peptides and antisera
Peptides were solid-phase synthesized from Boc- or Fmoc-amino acids [13], HF-cleaved, lyophilized, resuspended in 0.1 ~o TFA, and purified by RP-HPLC on a 1 × 25 cm semipreparative C-18 silica column (Supelco), developing the elution with a linear gradient of 0-60 ~o acetonitrile in 0.1 ~o TFA. An extra terminal tyrosine was included in each peptide to enable coupling of the haptens to the carrier protein (Keyhole limpet hemocyanin, KLH, Calbiochem) via bisdiazobenzidene for Tyr-Tyr linkage [14]. A single [14C]glycine residue (final

228 specific activity, approx. 10,000 dpm/mg peptide) in each peptide enabled calculation of coupling efficiency. Human CgB peptides synthesized corresponded to the N-terminus (human CgB~_15_[Tyr16]; MPVDNRNHNEGMVTRY) (Fig. 1 and Ref. 15) and the C-terminus ([Tyrol-human CGB644-657; YLELQKIAEKFSQRG) [15]. Control peptides corresponded to the bovine/human CgA N-terminus (bovine human CgAl_16-[Tyr17 ]; LPVNSPMNKGDTEVMKY) [ 11,16-19] and the bovine CgA C-terminus ([Tyro]bovine CgA417-431 ; YELEKVAHQLEELRRG) [ 16,17 ]. The structure of each peptide was verified by analysis of amino acid composition of 24 h HC1 hydrolysates [5,6]. New Zealand white rabbits were immunized intradermally [20] at 3-4 week intervals with 1 mg of peptide hapten coupled to K L H carrier and emulsified in Freund's adjuvant (complete for initial immunization; incomplete for booster immunizations). Antisera were harvested 2-4 weeks after booster immunizations.

Immunoblotting
After S D S - P A G E , proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose and stained either for total protein with amido black [21 ], or for CgB immunoreactivity by immunoblotting [21], using an avidin-biotin complex bridge (Vectastain, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Antisera were used at final titers of 1 : 100 to 1 : 1000 (v/v). To control for specificity of staining, some experiments were performed wherein antisera had been preadsorbed (4°C, overnight) with either the relevant hapten (100/ag/ml) or an irrelevant control peptide. Bands were quantitated by scanning stained nitrocellulose sheets with a Bio-Rad Model 1650 Scanning Densitometer (reflectance mode; Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA), with analysis by GS-350 Data System software (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA) in an I B M - P C - A T microcomputer.

Samples were usually electrophoresed in the absence of reducing agents. Some samples were electrophoresed either with or without pretreatment by the sulfhydryl reagent dithiothreitol (Sigma), 10-20 mM final concentration.

Results

RP-HPLC of a human pheochromocytoma chromaffin vesicle lysate (Fig. la) yielded several peaks, which were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. One peak (Fig. la, triangle) corresponded to a homogeneous SDS molecular mass 110-120 kDa protein, whose N-terminal sequence was M P V D N R N H N E G M V T R X I I E V L S N A L S K S (Fig. lb), matching the deduced N-terminal amino acid sequence for the recently reported human CgB eDNA [15]. On immunoblots of bovine chromaffin vesicle lysate (Fig. 2a), the anti CgB N-terminal antiserum recognized a 110-120 kDa band of clearly larger size than CgA (70 kDa). The CgB band was quantitatively more prominent in human pheochromocytoma chromaffin granules (Fig. 2b). Densitometric scanning of the appropriate amido

The specificity of the immunoblot staining with the anti N-terminal antibodies is illustrated in Fig. 3. Anti CgB N-terminal staining was abolished by preadsorption with the N-terminal CgB hapten (human CgBl_ls-[Tyrl6], but not the N-terminal CgA hapten (bovine/human CgAl_16-[Tyr~7 ]) (Fig. 3) or the C-terminal CgB hapten ([Tyr o ]human CGB644_657) (data not shown). All of the antisera directed against CgB's N-terminus (human CgBl_xs-[Tyrl6 ]) recognized CgB but not CgA (Figs. 2-5). Most of the antisera directed against CgB's C-terminus ([Tyro ]-human CGB644_657)recognized CgB but not CgA (Figs. 4 and 5); one anti CgB C-terminal antibody stained the CgA band as well (data not shown). The mobility of the CgB band was not affected by the inclusion or exclusion of sulfhydryl reagents. The relative abundance and apparent route of processing of CgB in several bovine neuroendocrine tissues is examined in Fig. 4. The quantitative rank order of CgB parent (SDS-PAGE 110-120 kDa) band immunoreactivity was: adrenal medulla > anterior pituitary > pancreas > small intestine, hypothalamus.

232 60 kDa N-terminal fragment was relatively prominent in the pancreas, (b) an 80 kDa C-terminal fragment was relatively scarce in the anterior pituitary (as compared to the adrenal medulla), (c) a 40 kDa C-terminal fragment was virtually unique to the anterior pituitary, and (d) in the anterior pituitary, the CgB parent molecule was more completely processed to C-terminal fragments than in the adrenal medulla. In three species (human, bovine and rat; Fig. 5) CgB's SDS-PAGE molecular mass varied from 110-130 kDa. In all species, N- and C-terminal fragments of CgB were visualized; in the 50-100 kDa range, N-terminal fragments were somewhat more prominent than C-terminal fragments, especially in bovine and human chromaffin tissue. CgB processing was investigated further by electrophoretic transfer of SDS-PAGEseparated human chromogranins onto PVDF (Fig. 6), followed by microsequencing of several bands. In addition to the full length CgB at 110-120 kDa (band I) and CgA at 70 kDa (band III), several bands of lower SDS-PAGE molecular mass than CgB (bands II, IV, V) possessed the CgB N-terminal amino acid sequence, suggesting that they were C-terminal cleavage fragments of the CgB parent molecule. Below band V (Fig. 6), attempts to sequence the lower molecular mass proteins did not yield adequate phenylthiohydantoin-derivative peaks.

Discussion

CgB has previously been isolated from bovine [22] and rat [23] chromaff'm granules. Human CgB's cDNA-deduced primary structure is known [ 15], and anti bovine CgB antisera have revealed CgB in human tissues by immunohistology and immunoblotting [3,4,24]. Nonetheless, human CgB has not previously been purified and characterized, nor has processing of CgB been fully characterized [25-27]. Our results indicate that a human protein exists whose N- (Figs. 1-6) and C-termini (Figs. 4 and 5) are compatible with those deduced from the human CgB cDNA sequence reported by Benedum et al. [15]. A similar rat CgB cDNA has recently been isolated and sequenced by Forss-Petter et al. [28]. In retrospect, this protein (human CgB) may be identical to the SDS-PAGE molecular mass 99 kDa acidic human chromogranin we isolated and characterized from pheochromocytoma chromaffin granules in 1984 [5]. Human CgB is far more abundant in chromaffin granules than bovine CgB - the mean ratio of CgB : CgA in human granules is approx. 10-fold higher than in bovine granules (1.23/0.115), consistent with the observations of Hagn et al. [3] and Schober et al. [4]. The relative neuroendocrine tissue abundances of CgB (Fig. 4; adrenal medulla > anterior pituitary > pancreas > small intestine, hypothalamus) are in general agreement with those obtained by radioimmunoassay of the CgB fragment GAWK [28], though Northern blotting of the CgB mRNA [ 29] and radioimmunoassay of the CgB fragment CCB [26] suggested that the pituitary was a more abundant source of CgB than the adrenal medulla. The rank order of neuroendocrine tissue distribution of CgB also parallels that previously reported for CgA (by radioimmunoassay) in normal bovine [6,7] or human [30] tissues. Benedum et al. [15] and Forss-Petter et al. [28] have pointed out the significant

233 sequence homologies between CgA and CgB at their N- and C-termini. None of our antisera directed against the human CgB N-terminus recognized CgA (Figs. 2-5), despite a small degree of N-terminal homology (MPVDNRNHNEGMVTR for human CgB, versus LPVNSPMNKGDTEVM for human CgA; 2/15residues identical, or 13 ~/o homology). While most of our antisera directed against the human CgB C-terminus did not recognize CgA (Figs. 4 and 5), one anti human CgB C-terminal antiserum stained the CgA band (data not shown). At the C-terminal region visualized by these antisera, human CgB (LELQKIAEKFSQRG) and human CgA (LEKVAHQLQALRRG) have 4/14 residues identical, or 29~o homology. The patterns of immunoblot staining of neuroendocrine tissues by antisera directed against the N- and C-termini of CgB suggest bidirectional cleavage of the protein. Benjannet et al. [26] have established specific cleavage sites in human pituitary CgB, giving rise to the derivative peptides GAWK and CCB. Our finding of a unique 40 kDa C-terminal CgB fragment in the anterior pituitary is consistent with the report of Iguchi et al. [25], who found evidence for tissue-specific processing of CgB in the bovine anterior pituitary. N- and C-terminal immunoblots on adrenal medullary proteins from three species (Fig. 5) suggest some interspecies variability in CgB processing - a 25 kDa C-terminal fragment was unique to the human sample. Schmid et al. [27] also identified a 25 kDa C-terminal CgB fragment in the human adrenal gland. Like Schmid et al. [27], we found that human adrenal medulla high-molecular-weight CgB fragments were predominantly N-terminal in location (Fig. 5); we confirmed intact N-termini by microsequencing three of these fragments (Fig. 6). CgA is also bidirectionally processed in chromaffin granules [31,32]. Indeed, an interior fragment of CgA seems to be the biologically active peptide p ancreastatin [33 ]. Whether the cleavage products of CgB possess biological activity remains to be established.
