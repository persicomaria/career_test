The first crystallographic structures of a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from a Gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus opacus 1CP (Rho 1,2-CTD), a Fe(III) ion containing enzyme specialized in the aerobic biodegradation of catechols, and its adducts with catechol, 3-methylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol, pyrogallol (benzene-1,2,3-triol), 3-chlorocatechol, 4-chlorocatechol, 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 4,5-dichlorocatechol and protocatechuate (3,4-dihydroxybenzoate) have been determined and analyzed. This study represents the first extensive characterization of catechols adducts of 1,2-CTDs. The structural analyses reveal the diverse modes of binding to the active metal iron ion of the tested catechols thus allowing to identify the residues selectively involved in recognition of the diverse substrates by this class of enzymes. The comparison is further extended to the structural and functional characteristics of the other 1,2-CTDs isolated from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover the high structural homology of the present enzyme with the 3-chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from the same bacterium are discussed in terms of their different substrate specificity. The catalytic rates for Rho 1,2-CTD conversion of the tested compounds are also compared with the calculated energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) of the substrates. A quantitative relationship (R = 0.966) between the ln kcat and the calculated electronic parameter EHOMO was obtained for catechol, 3-methylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol, pyrogallol, 3-chlorocatechol, 4-chlorocatechol. This indicates that for these substrates the rate-limiting step of the reaction cycle is dependent on their nucleophilic reactivity. The discrepancies observed in the quantitative relationship for 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 4,5dichlorocatechol and protocatechuate are ascribed to the sterical hindrances leading to the distorted binding of such catechols observed in the corresponding structures.

1. Introduction One of the key steps in the bacterial degradation of aromatic compounds in the environment is the oxidative cleavage of catechol and substituted catechols (Nishizuka et al., 1962). The ring cleavage of such compounds is catalyzed by catechol dioxygenases from two structurally and mechanistically distinct families based on the mode of ring cleavage. Intradiol dioxygenases utilize nonheme Fe(III) to cleave the carbon­carbon bond between the phenolic hydroxyl groups by inserting an oxygen molecule to yield muconic acid as the product; whereas extradiol dioxygenases employ non-heme Fe(II) or other divalent metal ions to cleave

the aromatic nucleus meta to the hydroxyl-substituents (Harayama et al., 1992; Que and Ho, 1996). On the basis of sequence similarity and substrate specificity a classification of catechol dioxygenases in subfamilies has also been tempted (Murakami et al., 1997). The first subfamily would comprise the enzymes with high enzymatic activity for chlorocatechols (chlorocatechol dioxygenases, CCDs), the second consists of the enzymes with fairly high enzymatic activities for catechol only or catechol and 4-methylcatechol, the third includes the enzymes with comparatively high enzymatic activities for 3- and 4-methylcatechols. Although the enzymes comprised in this third subfamily are the 1,2-CTDs, widely distributed through Gram-positive bacteria, the picture appears now to be more complex since it has been observed, based on sequence homology, that 1,2-CTDs from Grampositive strains are more closely related to the CCDs than to the

corresponding enzymes from Gram-negative bacteria (Eulberg et al., 1997). In the first X-ray structure of an intradiol-cleaving enzyme, the protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (3,4-PCD) from Pseudomonas putida, solved by Ohlendorf et al. in 1988, the non-heme iron(III) cofactor was found to be ligated by four amino acid side chains: two histidine and two tyrosine residues (Ohlendorf et al., 1988). A fifth ligand, a water molecule/hydroxide ion completes a trigonal bipyramidal structure. The structures of other members of the intradiol dioxygenase family, 1,2-CTD from the Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 and Pseudomonas arvilla C-1, were also solved (Earhart et al., 2005; Vetting and Ohlendorf, 2000). The tertiary structure of the 1,2-CTD enzymes, (Fe(III)a2 homodimers, is similar to that found in 3,4-PCD, although it contains a novel helical zipper motif at the interface of the two subunits, and contains two molecules of bound phospholipid. The active site of 1,2-CTD has the same arrangement of iron(III) ligands found in 3,4-PCDs. The X-ray structures of CCDs: 3- and 4-chlorocatechol 1,2dioxygenases from the Gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus opacus 1CP (Rho 3-CCD and 4-CCD), same organism of the enzyme subject of the present study, as well as hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase from Nocardioides simplex 3E (Ns HQD) have also been recently solved, thus revealing the structural differences in intradiol dioxygenases and starting to shed some light on the molecular bases of substrate specificity (Ferraroni et al., 2004, 2005, 2006). Structures of 3,4-PCD and 1,2-CTD with bound substrates have revealed that, upon substrate binding to the active metal iron ion, both the axial tyrosine ligand and the equatorial water ligand are displaced, to form a bidentate substrate complex. The tyrosine moves away from the iron(III) cofactor to leave an iron(III) centre with a vacant coordination site in a roughly octahedral geometry. Beyond the studies demonstrating that 1,2-CTD from Grampositive bacteria are more related to chlorocatechol dioxygenases than to the same enzymes from Gram-negative bacteria in term of amino acidic sequence,(Eulberg et al., 1997, 1998) this article will evidence the structural similarities of 1,2-CTD from Grampositive bacteria and CCDs as well as the differences with the enzymes from Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover different kinetic properties between 1,2-CTD from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have been observed. The first group of enzymes show a relatively high enzymatic activity not only for catechol but also for methylcatechols and do not discriminate between C3 or C4 positions while the others are less active towards methylcatechols and prefer 4-methylcatechol (Briganti et al., 2000; Broderick and O'Halloran, 1991; Dorn and Knackmuss, 1978; Matsumura et al., 2004; Ridder et al., 1998; Solyanikova et al., 1999). The substrate specificity of 1,2-CTDs is a crucial issue that needs to be clarified since it usually prevents the bacterial degradation of a large variety of aromatic compounds. Electronic factors clearly play a significant role in determining the efficiency of conversion of differently substituted catechols; however, it is less clear if steric factors influence the overall catalytic process (Ridder et al., 1998). Here we report for the first time the structures of 1,2-CTD from the Gram-positive bacterium R. opacus 1CP (Rho 1,2-CTD) and its adducts with a variety of catechols: catechol, 4-chlorocatechol, 3chlorocatechol, 4-methylcatechol, 3-methylcatechol, pyrogallol, 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 4,5-dichlorocatechol and protocatechuate. The structural information is analyzed and compared to the calculated quantitative structure/activity relationship (QSAR) parameters for the catechols in order to discern in which cases the catalytic efficiency depends on electronic or steric factors.

2. Material and methods 2.1. Microorganism and growth conditions Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase was purified from R. opacus 1CP grown on benzoate as a sole carbon and energy source. Biomass for enzyme purification was obtained by cultivation of the strain in a 10-L bioreactor with 7 L of mineral medium (Gorlatov et al., 1989) and constant addition of 0.3 mM benzoate at 29 °C. Substrate exhaustion was indicated by the decrease in oxygen uptake. The cells were harvested in the exponential growth phase by centrifugation at 3000g, washed twice with 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, and stored at À20 °C.

2.2. Preparation of crude extract Frozen cells were suspended in an equal volume of 50 mM Tris/ HCl, pH 7.2, and disrupted by French press. After the treatment with 0.01 mg/ml DNAase (Sigma, USA), the cell extract was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 31,000g. The supernatant was used for further investigations.

2.3. Enzyme purification All the procedures for enzyme purification were performed in the presence of 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.2. Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase was purified by a modification of an earlier used method, (Moiseeva et al., 2001) including four steps of purification: anion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose with a linear gradient of 0­0.5 M NaCl, hydrophobic chromatography on Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B with a linear gradient of 0.8­0 M (NH4)2SO4, gel-filtration on Superdex 200 prep grade in buffer with 0.1 M NaCl, anion-exchange chromatography on Resource-Q with a step gradient of 0­1M NaCl (0­10%, 10­40%, 40­100%).

2.4. Enzyme assay and analysis of the kinetic data Activity of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase was measured spectrophotometrically using a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrophotometer (Japan) in 1 cm quartz cuvettes at 25 °C. Specific rates of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase with catechol and its substituted analogues were determined using molar extinction coefficients for the corresponding reaction products (Dorn and Knackmuss, 1978). The enzyme activity with other substrates was measured as reported for protocatechuic acid (Stanier and Ingraham, 1954) and hydroxyquinol (Daubaras et al., 1996). The reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5 mM catechol or substituted catechols. The reaction was started by adding the enzyme. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 lmol product/min under the described conditions. For calculation of each parameter the data of at least three experiments were used. All kinetic constants were obtained with less than 10% error. The data were analyzed by fitting to the Michaelis­Menten equation using SigmaPlot8.0. Apparent kcat values were calculated on the basis of molecular mass of the enzyme subunit (33 kDa). Inhibition constants were determined graphically by utilizing the method of Dixon using catechol as the substrate (Dixon, 1953). Subunit molecular weight of the enzyme was determined by 12% SDS­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to the modified Laemmli method using Low molecular weight kit SigmaMarker (6.5­66 kDa) as a standard (Laemmli, 1970).

2.5. Crystallization and data collection The enzyme was crystallized at 293 K using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method from a solution containing 30% PEG400, 0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 0.1 M magnesium chloride. Crystals of the native enzyme belong to the monoclinic space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 89.79, b = 38.12, c = 76.06, b = 94.2. The asymmetric unit contains one monomer (Vm = 2.1, solvent content 41.4%). A native data set extending to 1.94 Å of resolution was collected at the beamline BW7A at the EMBL synchrotron source, Germany, using a MAR CCD165 and a wavelength of 0.949 Å. For the data collection the crystal was cooled at 100 K without the addition of any cryoprotectant to the mother liquor solution. The data were processed and integrated with Mosflm (Leslie, 1991) and scaled by SCALA, from the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational, 1994). The structure was solved by molecular replacement techniques using the program Molrep (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999) and one subunit of the Rho 3-CCD coordinates as a starting model (PDB Accession code 2BOY). One clear solution was evident giving an R -factor and correlation coefficient of 0.540 and 0.217. The model was refined against 1.94 Å resolution data, using the program Refmac5 from the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational, 1994). Manual rebuilding of the model was performed using the program Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). Solvent molecules were introduced automatically using ARP (Perrakis et al., 1999). Refinement resulted in R-factor and R-free values of 0.199% and 0.277%, respectively. Data processing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 4. The iron ion in the active site of the enzyme was refined anisotropically. The stereochemistry of the final model was analyzed with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993; McLachlan, 1982). The Ramachandran plot is of good quality; there are 213 non-glycine and nonproline residues; among these, 199 (93.4%) are in the most favored regions and 14 (6.6%) are in the additional allowed regions. The overall mean B factor of the structure after refinement was 30.87 Å2 for all atoms. The final model is composed by residues 23­280, one phospholipid molecule, one benzoate molecule, one carbonate ion, 236 water molecules. Electron density was missed for the first 22 residues and they were omitted from the model. In the active site a large density is visible close to the iron ion in the position that is occupied by a water molecule in the structure of native Ac 1,2-CTD. The density could be attributed to an aromatic inhibitor that is bound to the iron in a bidentate way like a benzoate as it has been already found in other two intradiol dioxygenases, Rho 4-CCD and Ns 1,2-HQD. In the present structure, after we try to model a benzoate ion into the density close to the iron in a Fo À Fc map we found no residual density and B factors, at unitary occupancy, comparable to the ones of the other residues inside the active site. Another small density was visible in Fo À Fc map close to the iron ion but in a position that was in the opposite site of the coordination sphere between His 220 and Tyr 162. The density could not be explained with a single water molecule since some residual density appeared around the oxygen atom and it clearly indicates the presence of another exogenous ligand to the active site iron. The shape and the height of the density were indicative of an inorganic anion such as carbonate or nitrate. Since nitrate ions were neither present in the crystallization medium nor in the purification procedure we think of a carbonate ion that could be originating from atmospheric CO2.

2.6. Preparation of substrate complexes and data collection Crystals of Rho 1,2-CTD in complex with catechol, 3-chlorocatechol, 4-chlorocatechol, 3-methylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol, pyrogallol, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (protocatechuate) were obtained under anaerobic conditions using a glove box (Unilab, MBraun). Crystals of the native enzymes were transferred inside the anaerobic chamber and washed twice in a stabilizing solution previously equilibrated for 24 h in inert atmosphere. After that crystals were soaked in a stabilizing solution containing one of the substrate at a concentration of 30 mM. After 2 h crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen inside the anaerobic chamber. X-ray data collection of crystal of complexes with Pyrogallol and 4-chlorocatechol were performed at 100 K, without the addition of any cryoprotectant to the mother liquor solution, on an Oxford Diffraction instrument equipped with a sealed tube Enhance Ultra (Cu) and a Onyx CCD detector. Data were integrated and scaled using the program CrysAlisPro. Data sets on crystal of complexes with 3-chlorocatechol, 3-methylcatechol and 4-methylcatechol were collected at 100 K at the X-ray diffraction beamline at the Elettra synchrotron source, Trieste (Italy), using a MAR CCD165 and a wavelength of 1.000 Å. The data were processed and integrated with Mosflm (Leslie, 1991) and scaled by SCALA, from the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational, 1994). A data set on crystal of the complex with protocatechuate was collected at 100 K at the PROXIMA1 beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron source Gif-sur-Yvette (France), using a MAR flat panel detector and a wavelength of 0.992 Å. The data were integrated and scaled using XDS. 2.7. Preparation of inhibitor complexes and data collection Crystals of Rho-catechol 1,2-dioxygenase in complex with 3,5dichlorocatechol and 4,5-dichlorocatechol were obtained by soaking the enzyme native crystals in a stabilizing solution containing 30 mM of the inhibitors for 2 h and 30 min. Data collections were performed at the X12 beamline at DESY, Hamburg (Germany) using a MARMosaic, 225 mm detector and a wavelength of 1.0028. The data were processed and integrated with Mosflm (Leslie, 1991) and scaled by SCALA, from the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational, 1994). 2.8. Refinement of the complexes Fo À Fc maps, calculated using the refined coordinates of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase without all the heteroatoms and after 10 cycles of refinement, indicated clear density for the bound substrates and for Tyr196 in a alternate conformation. Refinement was carried out using the program Refmac5 from the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational, 1994). Manual rebuilding of the model was performed using the program Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). Solvent molecules were introduced automatically using ARP (Perrakis et al., 2001). The iron ion in the active site of the enzyme was refined anisotropically. Statistics of the data processing and refinement are reported in Table 4. Coordinates of native Rho 1,2-CTD and in complex with catechol, pyrogallol, 4-chlorocatechol, 3-chlorocatechol, 3-methylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol, protocatechuate, 3,5-dichlorocatechol, and 4,5-dichlorocatechol have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank accession numbers: native 1,2-CTD: 3HGI, 1,2-CTD + catechol: 3HHY, 1,2-CTD + pyrogallol: 3HHX, 1,2-CTD + 3-methylcatechol: 3HJQ, 1,2-CTD + 4-methylcatechol: 3HJS, 1,2-CTD + 3-chlorocatechol: 3I4 V, 1,2-CTD + 4-chlorocatechol: 3HJ8, 1,2-CTD + protocatechuate: 3HKP, 1,2-CTD + 3,5-dichlorocatechol: 3I4Y, and 1,2CTD + 4,5-dichlorocatechol: 3I51). UCSF Chimera was used to produce all the molecular representations (Pettersen et al., 2004).

2.9. Molecular orbital calculations A nucleophilic attack of the iron(III)-bound catecholate on molecular oxygen is an essential step in the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase reaction (Que and Ho, 1996). According to the frontier orbital

theory the reactivity of soft nucleophiles depends on the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO), i.e. the energy of the most reactive electrons in the aromatic system (Fleming, 1976). Therefore, the HOMO energies of the catechol derivatives are calculated and compared with experimental kcat values. For

calculations on the catechol derivatives, the semiempirical AM1 method was applied (Dewar et al., 1985). All molecular orbital calculations were performed with HyperChem 8.0. Solvation effects and other influences due to binding of the catechols in the active site of catechol-1,2-dioxygenase are assumed to have no significant influence on the relative differences between electronic parameters of the homologous catechols. The outcomes of the in gas-phase calculations can thus be used to study relative differences within a series of related compounds when bound to the active site of the enzyme (Ridder et al., 1998).

3. Results 3.1. Structure of Rho 1,2-CTD Rho 1,2-CTD crystallizes with one monomer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The crystallographic model, obtained by molecular replacement using the structure of 3-CCD from the same

bacterium, lacks 22 amino acids at the N-terminal end due to the scarce electronic density in that region and therefore they were not included in the final model. The folding of Rho 1,2-CTD is similar to those of the other 1,2CTDs (Pa 1,2-CTD and Ac 1,2-CTD), CCDs (4-CCD and 3-CCD from R. opacus 1CP) and HQD (from N. simplex 3E) (see in Fig. 2A the comparison of Rho 1,2-CTD with the Ac 1,2-CTD and Rho 3-CCD) (Earhart et al., 2005; Ferraroni et al., 2004, 2005, 2006; Vetting and Ohlendorf, 2000). Rho 1,2-CTD shares a 44% identity (57% similarity) with Rho 3-CCD, 39% (57%) with Rho 4-CCD, 26% (40%) with Pa 1,2-CTD, and 26% (38%) with Ac 1,2-CTD (see Fig. 1). The structure of Rho 1,2-CTD presents the highest homology with Rho 3CCD; the main differences are noticeable at the N-terminal region since Rho 1,2-CTD is 28 residues longer (see Figs. 1 and 2A). The principal differences with the Gram-negative Ac 1,2-CTDs are at the N-terminal too, where helix 5 is shorter, strand 1 is missing, a new short helix is present between positions 124 and 128, helix 7 is missing, and the C-terminal is 27­30 residues shorter than the other 1,2-CTDs from Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore residues

23­32 do not present an alpha-helix structure as in the other 1,2CTDs but a random coil region, this is probably the reason for the lack of electronic density corresponding to the last residues caused by the high mobility of this part of the molecule. Moreover it extends in a different direction: in fact the 27 N-terminal residues

in Ac 1,2-CTD and Pa 1,2-CTD form the first helix (and the connection to the second) that points to the direction of the other identical subunit, while in Rho 1,2-CTD residues 23­32 are directed to the opposite direction i.e. towards the catalytic domain. The sequence alignment of 1,2-CTDs from Gram-positive bacteria shows

a certain degree of homology at the N-terminal thus suggesting a substantial structural homology (see Supplementary material). As already reported for the other structures of intradiol dioxygenases a phospholipid molecule is bound into a hydrophobic cavity at the dimeric interface but the identity of the head group could not be determined (see Fig. 2B).

Regarding the active site, the non-heme iron is coordinated by two tyrosines (Tyr 162 and Tyr196) and two histidines (His 220 and His 222). In the present structure, a benzoate-like ion is also coordinated to the iron ion in a bidentate asymmetric mode substituting the metal bound water molecule/hydroxide ion, observed in other structures of native 1,2-CTDs. An equivalent molecule has

also been observed in the active site of Rho 4-CCD and Ns HQD (Ferraroni et al., 2005, 2004). It is supposed that this exogenous ligand, which acts as a very weak competitive inhibitor for these enzymes, can function as stabilizer of the active enzyme by hampering the metal ion dissociation (unpublished results from our laboratory). In the Rho 1,2-CTD structure a carbonate ion is also present in the catalytic iron coordination sphere in a position trans to the benzoate increasing the iron coordination number to seven. The carbonate is bound in a mono-dentate mode with Fe3+­O1 distance of 2.73 Å and makes very strong hydrogen bonds with the peptide nitrogen of residue Ala 156, the carbonyl of His 220 and

two water molecules in a solvent cavity present below the active site (see Fig. 3A). A carbonate ion bound to the active site of an intradiol dioxygenase was found in the case of the Y447H protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase mutant where it coordinates to the iron ion in an asymmetric bidentate way in a position left open by the single point mutation (Frazee et al., 1998). In Fig. 3B the active site structural differences between the Rho 1,2-CTD as representative of Gram-positive bacteria and the Ac 1,2CTD indicative of Gram-negative bacteria are shown. A few residues are mutated: Val 81 (Gly 77 in Ac 1,2-CTD), Tyr 106 (Leu 109), Ile 198 (Cys 202), and Val 249 (Phe 253). On the contrary it

is remarkable that no different amino acidic residues have been observed into the catalytic pocket of 3-CCD from the same organism although striking substrate specificities differences have been detected (see Fig. 3C and Table 1). 3.2. Steady state kinetics with catechols The kinetic parameters of Rho 1,2-CTD have been experimentally determined for a series of catechols at saturating oxygen concentrations (Table 1). The kcat values obtained decrease in the order 3-methylcatechol > catechol > 4-methylcatechol > pyrogallol > 2,3dihydroxybenzoic acid > hydroxyquinol > 4-chlorocatechol > 3chlorocatechol > protocatechuic acid, whereas 4,5-dichlorocatechol, 3,5-dichlorocatechol and 3,4,5,6-tetrachlorocatechol act as competitive inhibitors towards catechol. The mono-methyl- and mono-chloro-substrates plus pyrogallol (3-hydroxy-catechol) exhibit low KM values in the lM range, whereas for hydroxyquinol (4-hydroxy-catechol) and the carboxy-substituted substrates about a 100-fold increase in KM is observed. On the other hand the inhibition constants for 4,5-dichlorocatechol and 3,5-dichlorocatechol resulted to be about 100-fold lower than the KM for the best substrates. The catalytic efficiency, generally expressed by the kcat/KM ratio, result to be very high for catechol and it is reduced to one half for the methyl-substituted catechols, to one sixth for pyrogallol followed by the mono-chlorocatechols converted at about one twentieth of the efficiency with catechol. The other tested substrates show very low affinities for the enzyme. 3.3. Structures of Rho 1,2-CTD-catechols adducts Fo À Fc electron density maps revealed a clear density on the iron ion for all the adducts and they were all refined at unitary occupancy with the exception of 3,5,dichlorocatechol which showed a double conformation (see below). Secondary binding sites for the substituted catechols were not identified. In all cases the catechols bind the iron ion in a bidentate mode displacing the benzoate ion (found in the native structure) and Tyr196 from the metal coordination sphere. In this unbound conformation Tyr196 forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr106 as observed in 3,4PCDs (Orville et al., 1997; Ridder et al., 1998). One hydroxyl group of substrate binds in an equatorial position trans to His222 and the other binds in an axial position trans to Tyr162. The ligand position trans to His220 is left open (Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary material Figs. S1­S3). The active-site geometry can be described as octahedral with one equatorial position open. Distances between the Fe(III) and its ligands in all complexes models are reported in Table 2. The Rho 1,2-CTD substrate complexes models do not show significant positional differences for the residues inside the active site or structural alteration of the backbone with the exceptions of the

dichlorocatechols adducts (see below). The rms positional differences for the main chain atoms in uncomplexed Rho 1,2-CTD and Rho 1,2-CTD substrate complexes are typically about 0.3 Å. The largest positional shift of about 2 Å is around the axial Tyr196 that is in the unbound state. The orientation of the substrates aromatic ring in Rho 1,2-CTD complexes with catechols is similar to that already found for the benzoate inhibitor in the native Rho 1,2-CTD structure and for catechol and 4-methylcatechol complexed with Ac 1,2-CTD (Vetting and Ohlendorf, 2000). Residues Arg217 on one side and Gly104, Pro105, Tyr106 on the other side impose the observed position of the aromatic ring. As shown in Fig. 4A the substituent in 3-chlorocatechol (and analogously in 3-methylcatechol and pyrogallol (3-hydroxycatechol), see Supplementary material Fig. S2) points toward the inner part of the catalytic cavity and makes contact with Ile102. Distances between the CD1 of Ile102 and the corresponding chloro-, methyl- and hydroxyl-substituents are respectively, 2.76, 2.95 and 3.02 Å. All the substituents in position C3 make also contacts with Arg217 and Gly104. The aromatic ring in this class of substrates makes interactions also with residues Ile198, Val81 and Leu77, that are located in the upper part of the catalytic cavity, and with Tyr 196 that in the unbound conformation partially locks the cavity opening. Even in the 4-substituted catechols (see Fig. 4B, plus 4-methylcatechol and 4-chlorocatechol in Supplementary material Fig. S3) the substituents point toward the inner part of the cavity in a para-position with respect to the hydroxyl that displaces Tyr196. Residues Asp80, Val81, Ile102, and Ala250 are at contact distances with chloro- and methyl- in the C4 position. Other notable interactions are observed with residues Leu77, Gly104, Pro105, Tyr106, Tyr196, Ile198, Arg217 as previously observed for the 3-substituted catechols adducts. The least squares superposition of the substrate complexes models shows slight differences in the position of the substrates. In particular the 3-substituted catechols undergo a shift in the direction of the active site opening if compared to the catechol position. This shift together with the simultaneous movement of the side chain of Ile192 minimize the steric hindrance of the substituent in C3 position. The same result is accomplished in the 4-substituted catechols with a slight tilting of the aromatic ring in order to reduce the contact with residue Val71. Side chains of residues inside the active site do not show important positional alterations in the substrate complexes models compared to the native Rho 1,2-CTD: slight shifts can be observed for the side chain of Pro105 in all complexes, for Ile198 and Leu77 in the 4-chlorocatechol complex and for Ile102 in the 3-substituted catechols complexes. In the 3- and 4-chlorocatechols complexes models a narrower opening of the catalytic cavity can be observed as the result of a

movement of the backbone corresponding to residues 193­195, close to Tyr196. Therefore the structure of the solvent in the opening to the cavity differs noticeably in these models compared to the native structure and a lower number of water molecules can be detected. The protocatechuate adduct (Fig. 5A) shows a substantially different orientation of the substituent into the active cavity. Indeed the carboxylate group is oriented toward the site opening thus interacting twice with Leu77: O2 with Leu CD1 (2.42 Å) and O1 with Leu O (2.65 Å); the carboxylate O2 is also making a hydrogen bond with a water molecule set on the site aperture (Wat52 at 2.46 Å). Also the aromatic ring of protocatechuate is significantly tilted with respect to the catechol and the other mono-substituted catechols adducts. As reported on Table 1 the protocatechuate molecule is a slow substrate for Rho 1,2-CTD showing about 0.4% of the conversion rate of catechol and KM increases about 100-fold. 3,5-Dichlorocatechol, and 4,5-dichlorocatechol although strong competitive inhibitors for Rho 1,2-CTD with KI of 90 and 20 nM, respectively, (Table 1) bind in a bidentate way by displacing Tyr196 like the standard substrates and with comparable bond distances (Table 2). However in both cases the aromatic ring results tilted, with respect to catechol and mono-substituted catechols, in the opposite direction with respect to the protocatechuate tilt (see Figs. 5A­C). The 3,5-dichlorocatechol adduct displays an equally weighted double conformation which mainly differs for the orientation of the 5-Cl substituent(see Fig. 5C). In one case the 5-Cl is directed between Leu77 (2.19 Å from CD1) and Ile198 (3.33 Å from CG2) whereas in the second orientation aims at the center of Ile198 (3.09 Å from CG2 and 3.71 Å from CD1), the 3-Cl substituent is oriented in both conformers as in all 3-substituted catechols adducts described above and interacts with Ile102 CD1. Also in the 4,5-dichlorocatechol adduct the 5-Cl substituent is interacting with Ile198 CG2 at 3.46 Å from CG2 whereas the 4-Cl also assumes the position observed in the 4-substituted catechol substrates thus interacting with Val81 CG2 (3.39 Å). For both the dichlorocatechols tested a significant shift of Ile198 side chain is observed to host the 5-Cl substituent. 3.4. Molecular-orbital-based QSAR for the conversion of substituted catechols by Rho 1,2-CTD The nucleophilic attack of the iron(III)-bound catecholate on molecular oxygen is judged to be an essential step in the catalytic reaction of catechol 1,2-dioxygenases (see Scheme 1) Bugg, 2001;
Tyr

Que and Ho, 1996. According to the frontier orbital theory the reactivity of soft nucleophiles depends on the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO), i.e. the energy of the most reactive p electrons in the aromatic system. It has been previously observed that the rate-limiting step of the reaction cycle of 1,2-CTD from P. putida (arvilla) C-1 is dominated by the nucleophilic reactivity of the substrate contributing to the differences in rates of conversion of different catechol derivatives, as far as 4-substituted substrate derivatives are concerned. In the present study the experimental kcat values for the variety of catechol derivatives tested with Rho 1,2-CTD were plotted against the EHOMO of the electrons in the aromatic ring of the catecholate mono-anions as calculated using the semiempirical AM1 method. A linear correlation is obtained with R = 0.966 (see Fig. 6) when the following substrates were considered: 3-methylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol, pyrogallol (benzene-1,2,3-triol), 3-chlorocatechol, and 4-chlorocatechol. This observation indicates that for these substrates the rate-limiting step of the reaction cycle is dependent on the nucleophilic reactivity of the substrate and not sterically hindered by the substituents

characterized in the present study. On the contrary the substrates hydroxyquinol and protocatechuate resulted not to obey to such linearity. The EHOMOs were also calculated and reported in Fig. 6 for the inhibitors 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 4,5-dichlorocatechol and 3,4,5,6-tetrachlorocatechol as a comparison and they clearly do not correlate with the others.

4. Discussion The crystallographic structure of Rho 1,2-CTD is the first structure solved for a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from a Gram-positive bacterium. The present structure clearly show that 1,2-CTDs from Gram-positive strains are more closely related to the CCDs than to the corresponding enzymes from Gram-negative bacteria as previously suggested by sequence homology studies (Eulberg et al., 1997). The most intriguing point that needs to be clarified is how different substrates and inhibitors interact with the active site of Rho 1,2-CTD hence leading to the observed variances in the catalytic performances of the enzyme i.e. its selectivity. Rho 1,2-CTD exhibits high activities not only towards catechol but also with methylsubstituted catechols; in CCDs the enzyme activity towards 3methylcatechol is even higher than for catechol (Table 3). On the other hand 1,2-CTDs from Gram-negative bacteria show a much lower activity (less than 10% than for catechol) with methylcatechols, in particular with 3-methylcatechol (Broderick and O'Halloran, 1991). Some functional differences for the interaction with the substrate could be ascribed to the N-terminal part of Rho 1,2-CTD even if the model lacks the first 23 aminoacids. In fact the N-terminal region has a markedly different secondary structure in Rho 1,2-CTD

compared with all the other intradiol dioxygenases and moreover it unwinds in the direction of the active site region. In the present study we solved the structures for nine enzymecatechols complexes to reveal the diversities in their mode of binding. In particular we obtained models for the enzyme complexed with catechol, 3-methyl-, 4-methyl-, 3-chloro-, 4-chloro- and 3hydroxy-catechol (pyrogallol) as well as with 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 4,5-dichlorocatechol and 3,4-dihydroxbenzoate (protocatechuate). As presented in Table 2 the ligand to metal distances are comparable to those seen for the binding of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate to Pp 3,4-PCD and catechol to Ac 1,2-CTD (Orville et al., 1997; Vetting and Ohlendorf, 2000). Usually an iron to catechol O2 atom bond 0.1­0.2 Å longer than the iron to catechol O1 atom (that substituting Tyr196) is observed although for 3Cl-catechol and pyrogallol the opposite behavior was detected. In the 4-methylcatechol adduct a symmetrical binding of the two oxygen atoms to iron is instead observed. All the enzyme-catechols models reveal that in the active site of Rho 1,2-CTD residues Leu77, Asp80, Val81, Ile102, Gly104, Pro105, Tyr106, Tyr196, Ile198, Arg217, Gln236 and Ala250 have influences on substrate binding. Sequence alignments (see the structural alignments in Fig. 1 and ClustalW alignments in the Supplementary material Figs. S4 and S5) show that all these residues are conserved among the 1,2-CTDs from Gram-positive bacteria (such as Rhodococcus sp. AN-22, Rhodococcus rhodochrous NCIMB 13259, Rhodococcus erythropolis AN-13, Arthrobacter sp. mA3, Arthrobacter sp. BA-5­17, Streptomyces setonii ATCC 39116, Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032). Indeed 1,2-CTDs from Gram-positive bacteria share a high degree of sequence identity among each others. For examples Rho 1,2-CTD shares 69% sequence identity with Rhodococcus sp. AN-22 and R. erythropolis AN-13, 68% with R. rhodochrous

NCMBI 13259, 67% with C. glutamicum ATCC 13032, and 55% with S. setonii ATCC 39116, while Rho 1,2-CTD is more distantly related to the 1,2-CTDs from Gram-negative bacteria (sequence identities less than 40%: for example 39% with P. arvilla C-1, 33% with Acinetobacter radioresistens S13 isoB and Acinetobacter sp. ADP1, 40% with P. putida mt-2, 39% and 35% with Acinetobacter lwoffii K24 I and II, respectively, 34% and 38% with Frateuria sp. ANA-18 I and II, respectively). Intermediate identity values are found with Gram-positive 1,2-CCDs: Rho 3-CCD 48% and Rho 4-CCD 42%, whereas Gram-negative 1,2-CCDs exhibit lower identities: Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 CCD 37%, and P. putida pAC27 CCD 36%. Regarding the functionality of specific residues, Arg217 and Gln236, thought to promote the deprotonation of substrates, together with Gly104, Pro105 and Tyr106 are required for the proper placing of the aromatic ring of the binding substrates into the active site. Furthermore Tyr106 forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr196 when this dissociates from iron due to the binding of catechols. This residue is conserved in all 1,2-CTDs from Gram-positive bacteria, in the majority of the 1,2-CCDs and in the 3,4-PCDs, while it is replaced by a Leu in the 1,2-CTDs from Gram-negative bacteria and by a Phe in 4-CCD and HQDs; consequently in the last two enzymes the dissociated tyrosine cannot form a stabilizing hydrogen bond with other residues as in Rho 1,2-CTD, most CCDs and 3,4PCDs. Concerning selectivity, 3-methylcatechol conversion rates are reduced of at least 10-fold compared to catechol, for Gram-negative bacteria 1,2-CTDs, whereas in the greater part of the known 1,2-CTDs from Gram-positive bacteria an increase to 130­160% of the activity toward catechol is often observed; only in a few cases a small reduction (less than 30%) is detected (see Table 3). In the case of 1,2-CCDs a larger turnover increase is always observed for 3-methylcatechol (up to 350% the activity with catechol) (Table 3). All the substituents in position C3 in Rho 1,2-CTD fit into a pocket formed by Ile 102 and Gly104. In particular the side chain of Ile102 is the nearest to substituents in position C3 (see Fig. 4A): Ile102 is virtually conserved among 1,2-CTDs with a very few exceptions (Met in Pseudomonas sp. P51, Val, Thr, Leu in a few other dioxygenases). Gly104 is absolutely conserved in all known catecholic intradiol dioxygenases. Unfortunately no structures of adducts of CCDs and Gram-negative bacteria 1,2-CTD with 3substituted catechols are known to ultimately explain the activity differences. Nevertheless we observe a decreased affinity for 3substituted substrates whenever the Tyr 106 is not conserved (see Pa 1,2-CTD and Ac 1,2-CTD (Leu), Rho 4-CCD (Phe)). We can hypothesize that Tyr196, when it is not anchored to Tyr106, could assume a more open conformation in the unbounded state, leaving, in this way, enough space to the 3-substituted substrate to turn round with the substituent in the outside cavity position. The lower affinity observed for this substrates could be ascribed to a certain degree of disorder in their binding to iron and/or a not suitable coordination for productive conversion, when they occupy the outside cavity conformation. Moreover the importance of other substitutions not directly involved with C3 position but influencing the catechol binding or the product release cannot be excluded. In addition, in 1,2-CTDs from Gram-negative bacteria a single residue insertion between positions 82 and 83 (a Gly residue), in a kink connecting helix 4 to helix 5, significantly changes the local structure of the top of the active cavity with respect to 1,2-CTDs from Gram-positive bacteria and CCDs. Consequently the primary sequence alignments published to date barely match the real structural alignments (see Fig. 1) in this crucial region. Residues Asp80 and Val81 located in helix 4 and just preceding the kink, in all known CCDs and also 1,2-CTDs from Gram-positive bacteria, show an altered arrangement if compared to all the Gram-negative 1,2CTDs and the HQDs. In fact one less residue in this kink results in a twist and a translation of helix 4 which generate a local shift of ½

aminoacid position thus altering the space on the top of the cavity above the bound catechols. Hence Asp80 and primarily Val81 side chains, have not a structural counterpart in 1,2-CTDs from Gramnegative bacteria (see Fig. 7B). In Gram-positive bacterial dioxygenases the side chains of Asp80 and Val81 point outwards and in opposite directions with respect to the substrate ring and related substituents whereas the residue corresponding to Val81 in Gram-negative bacteria 1,2-CTDs (Ala75 in Pa 1,2-CTD and Pro76 in Ac 1,2-CTD) is centered in an intermediate position pointing directly to the substrates and making contacts with the C4 position of the bound substrates (Fig. 7B). Indeed the 4-substituent (see Figs. 4B and 7B) is always found para to the hydroxyl that replaces Tyr 196 (para orientation); thus fitting into a pocket formed by Leu 77 (Leu73/72 in Ac and Pa 1,2CTD, respectively, hereafter), Asp80 (1/2 aminoacid position shifted with respect to Pro76/Ala75), Val81(1/2 aminoacid position shifted with respect to Gly77/76), Glu84(Asp81/Glu80), Ile102(Ile105/104), Gly104(Gly107/106), Tyr106(Leu109/108), Ile198(Cys202/198), Val249(Phe253/249), and Ala250(254/250). Asp80, Val81, Val249, and Ala 250 appear to be the crucial residues for the interactions with substituents in C4 position. Regarding substrate selectivity the Gram-negative Pa 1,2-CTD shows 70% activity toward 4-methylcatechol with respect to catechol similar to the values observed for the present enzyme (Tables 1 and 3). When the methyl group is changed to a chlorine, which has a comparable size but is substantially more electronegative, the observed turnover rate drops to 1­11% of that detected for catechol with all 1,2-CTDs (Table 3). Leu 77 (largely conserved in all bacteria), Val81, and Ile 198 (mainly Cys or Val and sometimes Ile in Gram-negative bacteria) are involved in interactions with substituents in position C5. Ile198 is replaced by a Cys in all 1,2-CTDs from Gram-negative bacteria (Cys202 and Cys198 in Ac 1,2-CTD and Pa 1,2-CTD, respectively) nevertheless this residue, according to our observations, does not seem to be directly related to the affinity of the enzymes for the 3- and 4-substituted substrates. In the majority of CCDs that show a broad substrate specificity and comparable activity for 3-chlorocatechol, and 4-chlorocatechol the residues that are involved in the interaction with the substrates are conserved, with the exceptions of positions 249 and 250 both Cys in CCDs apart from Rho 3-CCD (that exhibits Val and Ala in position 249 and 250, respectively, as the present enzyme). CCDs that show a different substrate specificity from those reported above, present mutations to residues Leu77, Val81, Ile102, and Tyr106 that we have shown to be essential in substrate recognition. In Rho 4-CCD, which exhibits a 10-fold activity increase with 4-substituted catechols, Val81 and Tyr106 are substituted with Ala and Phe, respectively; furthermore residues corresponding to positions 249 and 250 are Ser and Cys, respectively, (Ferraroni et al., 2004). In Pseudomonas sp. P51 CCD (TcbC), with higher affinity for 3,4-dichlorocatechol, Leu77, Val 81 and Ile102 are replaced with Val, Ala and Met, in Pseudomonas chlororaphis RW71 CCD, which shows higher affinity towards 3,5-dichlorocatechol and accept 4,5-dichlorocatechol and tetrachlorocatechol as substrates, has only Ile102 substituted with Val, in Burkholderia sp. R172 CCD has Val81, Ile102, Tyr106 replaced with Ala71, Ser92, Thr96 but kinetics properties are not available for this enzyme. An attempt to transform, through site mutagenesis, a 1,2-CTD into a CCD enzyme has been recently made (Caglio et al., 2009). Variant for Leu in position 77 (Leu69 in A. radioresistens isoB) into Ala has allowed to decrease the KM towards 4-chlorocatechol although the corresponding kcat decreases too. Actually this residue is conserved (Leu) throughout all ring cleaving dioxygenases analyzed, with the only exception of Pseudomonas sp. P51 1,2-CCD (TcbC) which shows a large affinity for 3,4-dichlorocatechol and where a Val is present. Another mutation in position 80 (Ala72 in

A. radioresistens isoB) to Gly or Ser allowed to slightly enhance kcat for chlorinated substrates. This suggests that substrate specificity for this class of enzymes is a complex issue, particularly if comparing 1,2-CTDs from Gram-negative bacteria and CCDs or 1,2-CTDs from Gram-positive organisms since their top cavity differ substantially due to the one aminoacid insertion between position 82 and 83 as discussed above. Interestingly the residues involved in the interaction with the substrate and conserved among 1,2-CTDs from Gram-positive bacteria are also identical in Rho 3-CCD: Leu77(49), Asp80(52), Val81(53), Ile102(74), Pro 105(77), Tyr106(78), Ile198(169), Ala250(221) and Arg217 (188). Regarding the activities towards 3- and 4-chloro-substituted catechols Rho 1,2-CTD exhibits only 5­10% of the activity shown for catechol whereas 3-CCD displays an higher affinity for 3-chlorocatechol than for catechol and about 40% for 4-chlorocatechol (see Table 1). In previous studies differences in substrate specificity between 1,2-CTDs and CCDs were hypothetically attributed to residues corresponding to positions 249 and 250 which are both cysteines in several Gram-negative CCDs; nevertheless now a question arises on which are the structural and/or electronic properties that differentiate Gram-positive 1,2-CTDs and Rho 3-CCD in their substrate specificity where Val 249 and Ala 250 are conserved across these enzymes. From the structural superimposition of Rho 1,2-CTD and Rho 3CCD (Fig. 3C)a search for differences in residues near to the active sites but not directly interacting with the substrates reveals a certain number of mutations. An alteration is present at Tyr161 (Glu132 in 3-CCD) on the external surface near to the active site entrance but about 11 Å far from iron; this could dynamically modulate the geometry of the active site entrance thus reflecting in the catalytic differences observed. A further look at the structural differences between Rho 1,2-CTD and Rho 3-CCD makes us to focus on the hydrophilic cavity present below the iron(III) ion which hosts several water molecules and allows to ions such as carbonate to enter the active iron(III) coordination sphere from below (see Fig. 7A and Supplementary material Fig. S6). Two mutations, Asn 158 (Ala 129) and Asp159 (Ala130), alter the solvent cavity aperture below the active site making it wider and more hydrophilic in the case of Rho 1,2-CTD. A further difference is present into the solvent cavity itself: His 155 (Gln 126). Moreover the slightly different conformation of the backbones corresponding to residues Gly160 (131) and Ala 194 (165) generates a somewhat wider cavity entrance in Rho 1,2-CTD too. It is well known, for metalloenzymes, that a larger exposition of a metal ion to solvent reduces its redox potential thus modulating the electronic density on the metal center (Cascella et al., 2006; Coullerez et al., 2006; Wirtz et al., 2000). This effect has also been observed for model compounds for Fe(III) dioxygenases where, as the charge on the ligand set increases, the Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox potential of the iron(III) center decrease (Viswanathan et al., 1998). Comparing Rho 1,2-CTD and Rho 3-CCD we detect in the first structure the further presence of a carbonate ion ligand to the iron and also several more water molecules in the mentioned solvent cavity. This higher hydrophilicity around the active metal in Rho 1,2-CTD probably reduces the redox potential of the iron ion with respect to that with the more hydrophobic surroundings of Rho 3-CCD. This results in a lower reactivity of Rho 1,2-CTD towards chloro-substituted catechols which are harder to oxidize than catechol itself. As shown in Fig. 5A, in the case of the protocatechuate adduct the substituent into the active cavity presents a substantially different orientation with respect to all the other mono-substituted catechols. Indeed the carboxylate group is oriented toward the site opening instead of being directed toward the internal part of the cavity as also observed in the protocatechuate adduct of 3,4-PCD.

The conformation assumed by protocatechuate is substantially distorted with respect to the other substrates adducts for two reasons: firstly, the internal part of the cavity cannot host the carboxylate group for the presence of the kink which reduces the cavity height and secondly, the aromatic ring of protocatechuate is significantly tilted with respect to the other mono-substituted catechols adducts due to the strong interactions with Leu77. In 3,5-dichlorocatechol, and 4,5-dichlorocatechol the presence of the additional substituent in position 5 results in sizeable tilts of the aromatic ring due to steric hindrances mainly with Ile198 which assumes in these adducts a unusual conformation (rotated and tilted away from the catechol C5 substituent about 1.5 Å from the position assumed by Ile198 in the other adducts) while the substituents in positions C3 and C4, respectively, are oriented as for the corresponding mono-substituted 3- and 4-chlorocatechols, respectively (see Figs. 5B and C). Ile198 is the only residue to substantially mutate conformation upon dichlorocatechols binding. Indeed two CCDs one from R. eutropha NH9 favoring 3,5-dichlorocatechol conversion and the other from Pseudomonas sp. P51 more specific for 3,4-dichlorocatechol where subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to identify residues critical in differentiating their substrate selectivity (Liu et al., 2005). This study showed that aminoacids in position 77, 81, and 102 in Rho 1,2-CTD numbering (positions 48, 52 and 73 for both CCDs) are relevant to differentiate their substrates specificity. The authors concluded that Leu77 and Ile102 were critical for high activity against 3,5-dichlorocatechol whereas Val77 and Ala81 were important for 3,4-dichlorocatechol selection. Their data interpretation was based only on molecular modeling with both substrates oriented in the opposite direction of that observed for the present enzyme. Since the present structure is not of a CCD enzyme we cannot exclude the reverse orientation of the substituents in such type of enzymes even if the active site of Rho 3-CCD resulted to be identical to the present 1,2-CTD and residues 77, 81 and 102 are strictly conserved between R. eutropha NH9 CCD and Rho1,2-CTD. In order to understand if the reactivity differences observed for the several catechols studied were due to electronic or steric factors we performed a molecular-orbital-based QSAR analysis. An extensive analysis by Ridder et al. using a number of 4substituted substrates revealed a strong correlation between substituent electronegativity and kcat for Pa 1,2-CTD thus suggesting that for those substrates other factors such as steric hindrances are not determining the rate-limiting step under the reported experimental conditions (Ridder et al., 1998). An analogous result was reported by Dorn and Knackmuss in studying 1,2-CCD from Pseudomonas sp.B13 (Dorn and Knackmuss, 1978). In the present study the kcat values of Rho 1,2-CTD for the majority of the substrates correlate quantitatively to a calculated parameter for nucleophilic reactivity (Fig. 6). For these substrates (catechol, 3-chloro-, 4-chloro-, 3-methyl-, 4-methylcatechols, and pyrogallol) no structural distorsions due to steric hindrances have been observed in the corresponding adducts. The correlation, based on the frontier orbital theory, enlighten that, during the reaction between a soft nucleophile and a soft electrophile, (Scheme 1) the interaction between the frontier orbitals, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the nucleophile and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the electrophile, is essential and lowers the activation barrier (Fleming, 1976). In the case of a series of related nucleophiles (the catechols) reacting with a given electrophile (the active site iron ion), the HOMO energy of the nucleophiles is the critical parameter influencing the activation energies. Since the nucleophilic attack of the aromatic p electrons of the iron(III)-bound catecholate on the oxygen molecule is an important step in the proposed reaction mechanism for 1,2-CTDs (Scheme 1), the HOMO of the catecholate is assumed to be the relevant frontier orbital. Thus, the natural logarithm of the kcat, which

The correlation obtained in the present study considering the substrates which do not present steric hindrances in the adduct structure, with R = 0.966 (Fig. 6), indicates that the nucleophilic reactivity of the substrates is contributing to the cause of the differences in rates of conversion of different catechol derivatives by Rho 1,2-CTD. It suggests that the mechanism of the rate-limiting step of the reaction cycle is dominated by the nucleophilic reactivity of the substrate. Undoubtedly, the substrate attack on molecular oxygen is dependent on the nucleophilicity of the substrate and

may possibly determine the overall rate of conversion. However, the subsequent reaction steps can also be influenced by the nucleophilic properties of the substrate. Among the exceptions to the linear correlation observed we find protocatechuate and hydroxyquinol which are slow substrates for Rho 1,2-CTD showing about 0.4% and 2.7% the conversion rate of catechol and the corresponding KM increase about 100-fold and 33-fold, respectively. Exceptions are also 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 4,5-dichlorocatechol although they behave as competitive inhibitors for Rho 1,2-CTD (Table 1). From the corresponding crystal structures it is evident that all the observed exceptions to the

linear correlation are related to distorted binding of the related catechols into the active site of Rho 1,2-CTD. The hydroxyquinol adduct structure solving was also attempted but, although the aromatic ring was visible, the density corresponding to the 4-OH could not be located. This would possibly indicate a disordered binding of hydroxyquinol in the two potential orientations only one of which is productive, thus explaining the reduced conversion rate observed. The importance of steric effects in 1,2-CTD earlier acknowledged by Dorn and Knackmuss is evidenced in the present study when electronegativity does not correlates with the rates for steps involved in ring opening even if we cannot exclude that in other intradiol dioxygenases and under different experimental conditions other steps such as product release are rate-limiting (Frazee et al., 1998; Fujisawa et al., 1972).
