Versatility of the carboxy-terminal domain of the a subunit of RNA polymerase in transcriptional activation: use of the DNA contact site as a protein contact site for MarA
Bindi Dangi,1,3 Angela M. Gronenborn,1 Judah L. Rosner2 and Robert G. Martin2* Laboratories of 1Chemical Physics and 2Molecular Biology, National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. 3 Martek Biosciences, Columbia, MD 21045, USA. Summary The transcriptional activator, MarA, interacts with RNA polymerase (RNAP) to activate promoters of the mar regulon. Here, we identify the interacting surfaces of MarA and of the carboxy-terminal domain of a the a subunit of RNAP (a-CTD) by NMR-based chemical shift mapping. Spectral changes were monitored for a MarA-DNA complex upon titration with a-CTD, and for a-CTD upon titration with MarA-DNA. The mapping results were confirmed by mutational studies and retention chromatography. A model of the ternary complex shows that a-CTD uses a `265-like determinant' to contact MarA at a surface distant from the DNA. This is unlike the interaction of a-CTD with the CRP or Fis activators where the `265 determinant' contacts DNA while another surface of the same aCTD molecule contacts the activator. These results reveal a new versatility for a-CTD in transcriptional activation. Introduction The a-CTD of RNAP plays an important role in transcriptional activation in Escherichia coli (Ishihama, 1992; Hochschild and Dove, 1998; Busby and Ebright, 1999; Gourse et al., 2000). The present study investigates the interaction of MarA with the a-CTD of RNAP. MarA is a transcriptional activator of the AraC family that activates at least 24 promoters of E. coli, the marA regulon (Barbosa and Levy, 2000; Pomposiello et al., 2001; Martin and Rosner, 2002), resulting in resistance of the bacterium to a wide range of antibiotics and superoxide generating agents (Demple, 1996; Alekshun and Levy, 1997). MarA, SoxS and the amino terminal domain of Rob exhibit ª 45% sequence identity and activate the same set of genes, albeit to different degrees (Ariza et al., 1995; Jair et al., 1996a; Martin et al., 1996; 1999; 2000). The X-ray structures of MarA-DNA and Rob-DNA complexes have been solved (Rhee et al., 1998; Kwon et al., 2000), confirming the structural similarity of these activators. MarA is a product and autoactivator of the marRAB operon which is repressed by MarR. MarR is inactivated upon binding salicylate resulting in the derepression of MarA (Martin and Rosner, 1995; Alekshun and Levy, 1997). The soxS gene is activated by oxidized SoxR, caused by superoxide generating compounds such as paraquat (Wu and Weiss, 1992; Li and Demple, 1994). Under normal growth conditions MarA and SoxS are present in the cell at very low levels (Martin et al., 2002; Griffith et al., 2004), whereas Rob is highly abundant, up to ª10 000 molecules per cell, but requires post-translational activation by bile salts or dipyridyl for full activity (Ali Azam et al., 1999; Rosner et al., 2002; Rosenberg et al., 2003). In contrast to many other prokaryotic DNA binding proteins, MarA, SoxS and Rob bind as monomers to asymmetric DNA sites with nearly identical consensus sequences (Li and Demple, 1996; Martin et al., 1999; Griffith and Wolf, 2001). At a given site only one orientation of the binding site is functional, depending on its distance to the promoter's -10 signal for RNAP (Fawcett and Wolf, 1995; Martin et al., 1999; Wood et al., 1999; Martin and Rosner, 2002). MarA binding sites centred at -52 or -42 are functional in the `forward' orientation; consequently the C-terminus of MarA lies proximal to RNAP. More distant sites (centred at -62 or -72) are functional in the `backward' orientation, consequently the N-terminus of MarA lies proximal to RNAP. The interaction of the activators with RNAP has been shown in vitro to require the a subunit, at least for a subclass of the promoters (Jair et al., 1995; 1996b), and each activator can bind RNAP

46 B. Dangi, A. M. Gronenborn, J. L. Rosner and R. G. Martin with or without the s subunit in the absence of DNA (Martin et al., 2002). Extensive alanine scanning mutagenesis provides additional evidence for the interaction of MarA and SoxS with DNA and RNAP (Gillette et al., 2000; Griffith and Wolf, 2002). Previous studies revealed that different surfaces of aCTD are used for interaction with the activator proteins CRP and Fis (Pan et al., 1996; Benoff et al., 2002; Cheng et al., 2002; McLeod et al., 2002). In both complexes, a surface not involved in contacting the activator, the `265determinant', interacts with DNA. This surface also binds to DNA in the absence of any activator and the strength of the interaction is greatly enhanced when the DNA sequence contains an UP element, a stretch of 5­6 adenines (Estrem et al., 1998; 1999; Busby and Ebright, 1999; Gourse et al., 2000; McLeod et al., 2002; Savery et al., 2002). Simultaneous binding by a single a-CTD to both the UP element and CRP or Fis has a synergistic effect on transcriptional activation (Busby and Ebright, 1999; McLeod et al., 2002). For complexes with either CRP or Fis, a-CTD interacts with 3 nt in the minor groove of the DNA at a site centred ª 8 nt from the end of the activator binding site (Benoff et al., 2002; McLeod et al., 2002). All three proteins (CRP, Fis and a-CTD) are bound on the same face of the DNA. This is possible because protrusions on CRP (the AR1 site) and Fis (Q68, R71, G72) interact at faces of a-CTD (the 287-determinant and 272-determinant, respectively) that align the 265-determinant for insertion into the minor groove. Because MarA and RNAP interact in the absence of DNA (Martin et al., 2002) and as it was likely that that interaction involved a-CTD, the simplest complex to examine was MarA with a-CTD. However, to maintain MarA in solution it was necessary to add the minimum MarA binding site, a 20 bp DNA fragment of appropriate sequence (e.g. that of the micF promoter binding site). When complexed with MarA, this length of DNA contains a minor groove of only 2 nt beyond the MarA binding site on one side and none on the other. Hence the DNA is too short to interact with the 265-determinant of a-CTD unless the MarA and a-CTD DNA binding sites overlap. Our results indicate that the 265-determinant on a-CTD, previously known to contact only DNA, is used instead for protein­ protein interaction with MarA. shift changes to identify interaction sites between the two proteins of the ternary complex formed between a-CTD and a preformed MarA:DNA binary complex. The DNA fragment used to form the binary complex was 20 bp long (see Experimental procedures for nomenclature), deliberately chosen to solubilize MarA while minimizing its length: (i) The phosphate between nucleotides 1 and 2 of the fragment forms hydrogen bonds with amino acids Y39 and H43 in the crystal structure (Rhee et al., 1998), (ii) NMR studies (Dangi et al., 2001) suggest that the purine base of nucleotide 1 may bind N7 in solution (although N7 is disordered in the crystal) thereby accounting for the fact that 20 of the 24 proven promoters of the mar regulon contain an A at position 1 (Martin and Rosner, 2002) and (iii) The phosphate between nucleotides 18¢ and 19¢ hydrogen bonds to Q91; and, the pyrimidine base of nucleotide 18¢ makes a van der Waals contact with Q91. Thus, only 2 nt and 1 sugar phosphate are exposed on the face of the DNA which interacts with MarA. Changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the 15Nlabelled MarA-DNA complex were easily discerned upon the addition of unlabeled a-CTD (Fig. 1A). Among those surface exposed amino acids that do not interact with DNA, amide resonances corresponding to T8 and L17 broadened and disappeared and those of W19, E21, V33 and R36 exhibited distinct and sizeable shifts. Other residues that showed chemical shift changes including those that interact with the consensus DNA and those that do not lie on the surface were: K41, W42, Q45 and F48. Table 1 summarizes all residues for which significant chemical shift changes were observed. Residues exhibiting minor chemical shift changes (<0.02 p.p.m. in both the 15N and 1H dimensions) were not considered in the analysis as such shifts are known to occur as secondary effects because of transmitted conformational changes. All other residues listed in the table were included in the analysis, and the final selection of residues used for docking was based on solvent accessibility criteria as discussed in Experimental procedures. Only those resonances without spectral overlap were used for analysis. In addition to inspecting the 1H-15N HSQC spectra, we also monitored the 1D-1H spectrum of the 20 bp DNA in the MarA-micF complex in the imino region (10­16 p.p.m.). Any conformational changes in the DNA upon interaction with a-CTD would theoretically result in chemical shift changes, however, none were observed upon addition of a-CTD to the binary MarA:DNA complexes. Note that the insolubility of MarA at high concentrations precluded studies in the absence of the 20 bp fragment. In a complementary fashion, resonances of 15N-labelled a-CTD that exhibited significant chemical shift differences upon titration with unlabeled MarA-micF were monitored.

The experimental dissociation constants for wild-type MarA-micF and two mutant forms of MarA, W19A and W19A R36A (see below) with a-CTD under the very low salt conditions used here were 21, 183 and 204 (±10%) mM, respectively. No attempts have been made to measure the dissociation constants under more physiological conditions. We also investigated the effect of a-CTD on the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of SoxS-micF. As in the case of MarAmicF, significant changes were observed. Because no NMR spectral assignments for SoxS are available, these cannot be easily translated into an interaction interface. However, given the unique spectral position of the TrpNOEH, it is possible to implicate W13 (equivalent to W19 in MarA) in the interaction with a-CTD. Model of the ternary complex Specific protein­protein interactions play a critical role in the regulation of biological events, and models of protein complexes provide insight into details of these interactions. A large number of docking programs have been developed over the past several years to study protein complexes. HADDOCK, FTDOCK and BIGGER are some of the programs currently in use (Jackson et al., 1998; Palma et al., 2000; Dominguez et al., 2003). One of the advantages of HADDOCK (High Ambiguity Driven Protein­Protein Docking) over other programs is the ability to include biochemical data, such as titration shifts, NOEs and mutagenesis results, along with energetics and shape complementarity to drive the docking process right at the outset. In contrast, most other programs use experimental data in a final filter to select the appropriate models. Here we employed HADDOCK to derive a model of a-CTD, MarA and DNA. Details of the docking process and selection of the cluster are discussed in Experimental procedures. The final cluster chosen to represent the best solution comprised 17 structures, and statistics for this cluster are shown in Table 2. The energy of this cluster is -277 kcal mol-1 and that of the next best, -265 kcal mol-1. The backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) between clusters averages 3.5 Å. A backbone representation of the ensemble of 17 structures in the final cluster and a ribbon representation of the lowest energy structure displaying the key interactions are shown in Fig. 2. An analysis of the best cluster reveals the presence of several hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions between residues at the interface of the two proteins. The principle interactions derived from the model (Fig. 2C) involving side-chains of MarA residues are hydrophobic contacts between W19 (MarA) and R265 and N294 (a-CTD) and hydrogen bonds between R36 (MarA) and N294 and L295 (a-CTD). Virtually all the remaining contacts involve backbone interactions. For

a. Only residues in non-overlapping regions and those with chemical shift changes exceeding 0.02 p.p.m. in either 15N or 1H dimensions are shown. b. Spectral changes for the NH resonances were recorded for the 15N labelled protein component in the ternary complex formed between MarA-DNA and the a-CTD of RNA polymerase as described under Experimental procedures.

Most affected were L260, T263, R265, A267, L270, A272, E273, I275, Y277, E286, T292, N294, L295, G296, S299, E302 (Table 1; Fig. 1B). The observation, that four of the surface exposed amino acids of a-CTD that define the 265-determinant (265, 294, 296 and 299) exhibited significant chemical shift differences, implies that the 265-determinant interacts directly with MarA (and not DNA) or that the 265-determinant's DNA-binding site overlaps the MarA binding site as all but 2 nt of the 20 bp DNA are within the MarA binding site. Upon addition of up to a threefold molar excess of the 20 bp micF DNA (without MarA), the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labelled a-CTD showed very minor changes for only a few residues (<0.02 p.p.m. in either the 1H or 15N dimension). This implies that some lowaffinity interaction between a-CTD and DNA occurs, in agreement with the previously noted weak interaction of a-CTD at the `265-determinant' with non-specific and AT-rich DNA sequences (Gaal et al., 1996; Murakami et al., 1996; Estrem et al., 1998; 1999; Savery et al., 1998; 2002; Busby and Ebright, 1999; Gourse et al., 2000; Yasuno et al., 2001; Benoff et al., 2002; McLeod et al., 2002).

example, H14, S15, and S37 of MarA interact with V264, R265, N268, P293, N294, L295, and K298 of a-CTD, and most of these contacts are hydrophobic. Further details of the model are listed in the legend for Fig. 2C. Testing the docking model by retention chromatography in the absence of DNA To test the docking model, we examined the effects of mutations on the ability of a-CTD and MarA to interact in vitro. His6-a-CTD was adsorbed to a nickel sulphatetreated chelating sepharose resin in the presence of MarA, and the ability of the resin-bound His6-a-CTD to retain MarA was monitored as shown schematically in Fig. 3A. When only wild-type His6-a-CTD was added to the resin, the wash was free of His6-a-CTD but His6-aCTD was released when the resin was treated with EDTA (Fig. 3B, gel I) indicating that the His6-a-CTD had been bound to the resin. When only MarA was added to the resin, the supernatant and wash contained traces of MarA, and subsequent treatment with EDTA released further traces of MarA indicating that small amounts of the MarA had bound to the resin. By contrast, the wash of the resin that initially was loaded with both His6-a-CTD and MarA was virtually free of His6-a-CTD and MarA but con-

siderable amounts of both His6-a-CTD and MarA were released when the resin was treated with EDTA. Densitometry was used to quantify each band. Because the intensity is in arbitrary units for each gel, only the ratios of band intensities could be compared from one gel to the next. In the experiment illustrated, with the initial sample containing His6-a-CTD, 37% of the input MarA (Fig. 3B, gel I, column A divided by the input) was recovered following treatment of the resin with EDTA. When the initial sample did not contain His6-a-CTD, the recovery was 8.6% (Fig. 3B, gel I, column B divided by the input). The average values of input recoveries obtained with three different preparations of wild-type MarA and two of His6-a-CTD are summarized in Table 3. For the His6-aCTD containing samples, 36% of the input MarA was recovered following elution with EDTA compared with 9.7% of the input in the absence of His6-a-CTD. It should be noted that although the input contained approximately equimolar concentrations of MarA and a-CTD, we never obtained equimolar concentrations in the EDTA eluate fractions. At best, the ratio was ª 0.5 mol of MarA per mole of His6-a-CTD retained. This is as expected given the low binding constants for the interaction of the MarADNA complexes with a-CTD determined by NMR (above). Indeed, all of the MarA could be eluted from these samples by five serial washes. When MarA protein containing a W19A mutation was used in a similar set of experiments, the wild-type His6a-CTD failed to retain significant amounts of MarA (Fig. 3B, gel II, and Table 3), although the same preparation of MarA W19A bound DNA with normal efficiency (see below). Only traces of the mutant MarA were detected in either the wash or the eluate. The average recoveries for three experiments (Table 3) indicate that W19A MarA was not retained in the presence or absence of wild-type His6a-CTD (3.2% and 3.3% of the input, respectively). We thus conclude that W19 is essential for the interaction of MarA with a-CTD. When mutant His6-a-CTDs were added to wild-type MarA and analysed in the same manner, retention of wildtype MarA was not observed (Fig. 3B, gels III and IV). For both R265 His6-a-CTD and N294 His6-a-CTD the recoveries of wild-type MarA (9.4 and 11%, respectively) were

(C) Ribbon diagram of the ternary complex showing MarA (orange), a-CTD (black) and a stick representation of mar DNA (purple). Key residues at the interface of MarA and a-CTD are shown in red and green, respectively. Interactions at the MarA:a-CTD interface include: S37 (MarA) with backbone atoms of P293 and N294 (a-CTD) and a hydrogen bond between its backbone oxygen and the Hd of N294. (The hydroxyl group of S37 hydrogen-bonds to the NeH atom of W19, thereby fixing W19 in an orientation suitable for interacting with residues of a-CTD.) R36 (MarA) forms a hydrogen bond between its Hzs and the backbone oxygen of L295 (a-CTD) and the amino protons of N294, the latter in 50% of the structures. The Ca and Cb of D18 engage in hydrophobic contacts with Cg and C¢ of V264. The C¢ of D18 makes contacts with the Cb of R265 and its Cg atoms contact the Cb and Cg of N268. D18 also forms hydrogen bonds to the side-chain amino protons of N268. D22 Cb, Cg atoms interact with side-chains of V264 and R265. The D22 carboxylate oxygens are involved in electrostatic interactions with Hz of R265 and Hz of K298 in 40% of the structures.

not statistically different from the controls lacking His6-aCTD (8.6 and 7.3%, respectively). We therefore conclude that wild-type His6-a-CTD and MarA form a complex in the absence of DNA with residues R265 and N294 of a-CTD and residue W19 of MarA being crucial for the interaction. Genetic predictions of the model The model (Fig. 2) of the ternary complex predicts that the side-chains of only two amino acid residues of MarA

(W19 and R36) are pivotal for the interaction with a-CTD. All other interactions involve backbone atoms. As a consequence, alanine substitutions at only two positions should result in loss or reduction of MarA activity at Class I promoters (where s interactions are precluded). Most of the amino acids of MarA predicted by the model to interact with a-CTD had previously been mutated to alanine and tested for transcriptional activation of marA regulon promoters (Gillette et al., 2000). However, interpretation of alanine scanning mutagenesis is ambiguous

52 B. Dangi, A. M. Gronenborn, J. L. Rosner and R. G. Martin as reduced activity can be caused by inability to interact with RNAP or protein instability or misfolding (Griffith et al., 2004). Furthermore, alanine substitution mutants may have full activity if the interactions do not involve amino acid side-chains. We have therefore reinvestigated our previous results and constructed additional mutants that were assayed for transcriptional activation of several of the marA regulon promoters (Table 4). In the model of the ternary complex W19 of MarA plays a major role in binding to a-CTD. In agreement with this and previous results (Gillette et al., 2000), the activity of the MarA mutant W19A was severely inhibited at all promoters tested. The inactivity of W19A (and W19A R36A) is not because of misfolding as it binds mar DNA with an affinity nearly identical to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 4). Furthermore, W19F and W19Y, in which the tryptophan is replaced by other aromatic amino acids, are partially functional with activities ranging from 37 to 97% of wild-type (Table 4). The model also predicts that the side-chain of R36 plays a major role in binding to a-CTD. As expected, we find that MarA R36A and R36E are defective for activation at all promoters tested (Table 4) although, at least for R36A, DNA binding is not significantly impaired (Fig. 4). The

The 20 bp mar promoter binding site for MarA was 32P-end labelled, mixed with MarA and subjected to electrophoresis on a 6% acrylamide gel. The positions of free and MarA-bound DNA are indicated. Final concentrations of MarA were 0, 23, 70 and 210 nM for each protein. The dissociation constants, estimated by quantitative analysis of four such autoradiograms, were for wild-type, R46A R96A, W19A and W19A R36A MarA proteins, 127 ± 23, undetectable, 138 ± 17, and 163 ± 41 nM-1, respectively.

The values listed represent the average of three experiments, each performed in duplicate. Duplicates and averages all agreed to ±10%. b. Percent activation = 100 X activity of (mutant ­ plasmid control)/ (wild-type ­ plasmid control). For marA, the activity with the wild-type plasmid was 1325 MU, the plasmid control was 350 MU; for zwf, 400 and 150 MU, respectively; for micF, 560 and 27 MU, respectively; and for inaA, 360 and 60 MU, respectively.

R36K mutant is partly defective for the micF and mar promoters demonstrating that more than the proper charge is necessary for full activity at this position. Such reduced activity is consistent with the model that shows the guanidino group of R36 involved in bidentate contacts. The double mutant R36A W19A was severely inhibited in its ability to activate transcription, although its DNA binding capacity is similar to that of wild-type MarA (Fig. 4). Griffith and Wolf (2001) have demonstrated that K30A of SoxS, the MarA analogue of R36, is similarly defective. The model proposes that S37 makes a hydrophobic contact with P293 and hydrogen-bonds to N294. Both contacts primarily involve backbone atoms and therefore alanine substitution would be expected to have minimal effects (Gillette et al., 2000 and Table 3). As predicted, S37A had at least 69% of the wild-type activity on all the promoters tested. According to the model, D18 and D22 in MarA primarily interact with a-CTD through their backbone atoms. The exceptions are hydrogen bonds between the D22 sidechain carboxylate in MarA and the Hzs of R265 and K298 in a-CTD, and these potential contacts appear in only 40% of the HADDOCK-generated structures. It is therefore not surprising that alanine substitution at either of these positions had minimal effects (Gillette et al., 2000; Table 4). We also find that D22H and D18A D22A mutants are nearly indistinguishable in activity from wild-type. Furthermore, double and triple mutants D18A R36A, D22A R36A and D18A D22A R36A behave like R36A alone. Finally, according to the model, H14 and S15 are in close contact with N268 and N294. We previously showed that H14A is defective at the zwf and micF promoters but had wild-type activity at others and that S15A had ª70% of the wild-type activity at micF (Gillette et al., 2000). Here

Contacts between a-CTD and the transcriptional activator MarA 53 we find that S15A in combination with D18A behaves like D18A alone and in combination with D18A R36A behaves like R36A alone (Table 4). These results are consistent with H14 and S15 making backbone contacts with a-CTD. In summary, the mutational analysis is consistent with the structural features of the model: alanine substitution of amino acids predicted to interact with a-CTD via sidechains (W19 and R36) are severely defective for transcriptional activation, whereas alanine substitution for amino acids interacting with a-CTD via backbone atoms (principally S37, D18, D22, H14, and S15) are not. Discussion The NMR data presented here provide the first direct physical evidence for the interaction between MarA or SoxS and the a-CTD of RNA polymerase. Previous in vitro studies had shown that MarA, SoxS and Rob bind to RNAP (with or without the s subunit) in the absence of DNA, and that a-CTD was needed to activate certain marA/soxS/rob regulon promoters (Jair et al., 1995; 1996a,b; Martin et al., 2002). A structural model of the ternary complex (activator-a-CTD-promoter DNA) based on the NMR data suggests that the primary residues that are important for the binding of MarA to the a-CTD of RNAP (MarA:a-CTD) are: W19:N294; W19:R265; R36:N294; R36:L295; S37:P293; S37:N294; D18:R265; D18:N268; D22:V264; D22:R265; D22:K298; H14: N268; S15:N294 (Fig. 2A­C). The model is supported by retention chromatography in the absence of DNA (Fig. 3, Table 3) and by in vivo mutational data (Table 4). The latter also highlights the limitations of alanine substitution mutagenesis as only two of the seven MarA amino acids important for docking do so via their side-chains. Promoters stimulated by CRP, Fis and the MarA subfamily all have within them activator binding sites narrowly centred at positions -42 (Class II), -62 or -72 (Class I) relative to the start of transcription and all require a-CTD to function optimally. a-CTD interacts with CRP at the `287-determinant' and with Fis at residues R271, A272, and E273. a-CTD also interacts with DNA including UP elements using a separate face, the `265-determinant', whether or not CRP or Fis are present (Benoff et al., 2002; McLeod et al., 2002). In contrast, our results indicate that the `265-like determinant' of a-CTD interacts with MarA (Fig. 2) demonstrating that this surface is capable of interacting either with DNA or protein, a possibility previously suggested (Murakami et al., 1996). A protein­protein contact was confirmed by the finding that immobilized wild-type Histagged a-CTD, but not mutants R265A-a-CTD nor N294Aa-CTD retain MarA in the absence of DNA. This, in turn, implies subtle structural differences between the activated transcription complexes of MarA and CRP (Fig. 5A). The location of the a-CTD docking site on MarA also suggests why the MarA binding site is functional in two different configurations: the forward orientation when centred at -52 and the backward orientation when centred at -62 (Fig. 5B). We had previously noted (Martin et al., 1999) that the D18-D22 surface of MarA is in the same 3dimensional position relative to RNAP in both configurations. We now find that a-CTD binds to MarA very close to this site. Therefore, a simple 180 flip around the flexible connection between the two domains of a allows RNAP to contact MarA at these different promoters. The model also suggests that the binding of a-CTD to MarA may alter the conformation of MarA and modulate its DNA binding. Resonance shifts are observed for six internal MarA amino acids (L17, E21, V33, K41, W42, Q45 and F48) upon binding a-CTD. Q45 is known from the Xray structure to form hydrogen bonds with two of the consensus bases and also to form two hydrogen bonds with K41. K41 in turn is involved in hydrogen bonding with E35, the amino acid immediately adjacent to R36. Thus, a surface interaction between R36 and a-CTD might be propagated through E35, K41 and W42, to Q45 and alter the binding affinity of MarA for its cognate DNA. The changes observed for F48 are most likely also transmitted via Q45, both residues being connected by H-bonds. The notion that interaction of MarA with a-CTD enhances the binding of MarA to its binding site would seem to support the `scanning' or `prerecruitment' (Griffith et al., 2002; Martin et al., 2002) hypothesis of activation. According to this hypothesis, MarA and SoxS bind first to RNAP and this complex then scans the genome for properly configured RNAP and activator binding-sites. If MarA binds to its recognition sequence more tightly when complexed with RNAP, the complex would be capable of greater selectivity in finding appropriately configured sites than it would be if the binding to DNA were sequential, first MarA and then RNAP. Finally, our results have implications for other AraC family members. For SoxS, only W13, the analogue of W19 in MarA, was unequivocally identified in our NMR experiments. This residue was found by chemical shift mapping to be a site of interaction between SoxS and a-CTD. In addition, spectral changes in a-CTD upon addition of SoxS are similar to those seen for MarA, suggesting that the interactions of a-CTD with SoxS and MarA are similar. We therefore propose that the interaction of a-CTD with SoxS is analogous to that of MarA (Fig. 2) and that the SoxS residues at the interface are: Q8, D9, A12, W13, E16, K30 and S31. Based on alanine substitution mutagenesis, Griffith and Wolf (2002) implicated H3, K5, D9, K30 and S31 in the interaction. Extending the model to Rob (Fig. 2D) results in only one potential clash involving the R275 side-chain of Rob and P251 of a-CTD. It is possible, however, that the side-chain

of R275 is flexible enough to move out of the way and not interfere with complex formation. Alternatively, such interference may account for the low activity of unmodified Rob as a transcriptional activator and for the increased activity of Rob that is post-translationally modified by the binding of dipyridyl or bile salts (Rosner et al., 2002; Rosenberg et al., 2003). Comparing MarA with the 22 other E. coli paralogues of AraC, a high degree of sequence conservation at 14 positions within the first 50 amino acids of MarA was noted (Fig. 6). Of these `strong consensus' positions, only three are candidates for interaction with RNAP as they are surface-exposed and not involved in DNA binding: position 19 is predominantly occupied by aromatic amino acids while positions 33 and 37 are preferentially occupied by aliphatic amino acids. Positions 19 and 37 were identified as sites of interaction in the docked complex at the MarA­ a-CTD interface and the location of V33 suggests a role for positioning the aromatic ring of W19. Interestingly, no

charged amino acids are found at `strong consensus' positions that do not contact DNA, correlating well with the model which suggests that most of the contacts between MarA and a-CTD are non-polar. Among the 12 less well conserved `weak consensus' amino acids that are surface exposed, eight are polar and seven of these are charged. These less well conserved positions may define subclasses within the AraC family. For example, although only nine of the paralogues have a basic amino acid at position 36 (of importance in MarA binding to a-CTD), these include all four members of the MarA/SoxS/Rob/TetD subfamily. Furthermore, whereas only one of the 12 paralogues with an aromatic amino acid at position 19 has a basic amino acid at position 15, eight of the remaining 11 paralogues contain basic amino acid at this position. Based on this notion of subclasses we would expect AraC and MelR to interact with a-CTD like the MarA/SoxS/Rob/TetD subfamily because they also possess aromatic amino acids at position 19 and basic

The number of homologous amino acids are indicated at the bottom of each column. A `strong consensus', is indicated when that number is at least 12; a `weak consensus', is indicated when that number is at least 8. The locations of the consensus amino acids are indicated as follows: B, backbone; S, surface exposed; and D, surface exposed but known to interact with DNA.

amino acids at position 36. If true, the important amino acids for interaction with a-CTD via the `265-like determinant' would be F199 and H216 for MelR and Y185 and H202 for AraC. Although the MelR docking site has not yet been identified, its interaction with a 265-determinant was reported but interpreted differently (Grainger et al., 2004). Experimental procedures Nomenclature
A 20 bp DNA fragment corresponding to the micF binding site was used for all the NMR studies: one strand (5¢-ACAG CACTGAATGTCAAAAC-3¢) is numbered 1­20, and the complement (3¢-TGTCGTGACTTACAGTTTTG-5¢) is numbered 1¢ to 20¢, sequentially.

were expressed and purified as described previously (Jair et al., 1995; Dangi et al., 2001). SoxS was purified similarly, using 50 mM EDTA for elution from the nickel-sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences). a-CTD was isolated using minor modifications of the above protocol. In brief, N9946 cells (BL21[lDE3] plysS) containing plasmid pET15b with an insert encoding a-CTD amino acids 249­329 (cloned between the Nhe1 and BamH1 sites) were lysed by extensive sonication at 4C in 50 mM Hepes, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, followed by centrifugation at 20 000 g for 45 min. The supernatant was loaded on a pre-equilibriated Nickel-chelating sepharose column (2.5 ¥ 10 cm) and washed with 50 mM Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, followed by 50 mM imidazole in the same buffer to remove weakly bound proteins. This was followed by gradient elution (50­300 mM imidazole in the same buffer). Protein containing fractions were pooled, dialysed against 50 mM Hepes, 250 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, and the His-tag was removed by thrombin cleavage (10 U mg-1 of protein) at 37C for 24­48 h. Finally, the protein was purified on a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 30 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 6.0 and peak fractions were pooled.

NMR samples were in 20 mM phosphate, 20 mM EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 6.7. MarA-DNA and SoxS-DNA complexes were prepared as outlined by Dangi et al. (2001). Oligonucleotides used for NMR were obtained from Midland Certified (Midland, Texas) and those for binding studies were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA/RNA synthesizer. Protein and DNA concentrations were determined by measuring absorbances at 260 and 280 nm, respectively. Extinction coefficients for the various proteins (wild-type and mutants) were calculated using the BIOPOLYMER program available at http://paris.chem.yale.edu/extinct.html. using the program HADDOCK, version 1.2. The crystal structure of MarA-mar (1BLO.pdb) and the NMR structure of aCTD (1COO.pdb) were used for modelling the interactions. The MarA and mar DNA differed from that used to obtain the crystal structure in minor ways: the mar DNA was restricted to only 20 base pairs (5¢-3¢: ATGCCACGTTTTGCTAAATC and its complement) by removing some of the terminal bases and N- and C-terminal residues were added to the protein to give the full-length 129-residue MarA protein. This structure was energy minimized by conjugate gradient minimization in SwissPDBViewer, version 3.7, using the GROMOS force field. Residues 1­8 and 124­129 of MarA and residues 319­ 329 of a-CTD were allowed to be completely flexible (Jeon et al., 1995; Rhee et al., 1998). The docking protocol was identical to that previously described (Dominguez et al., 2003). In brief, interacting residues for the two proteins were defined based on residues with significant chemical shift perturbations. A subset of these residues were defined as `active' if either main chain or side-chain solvent accessibility was more than 50%. Passive residues were defined as all solvent accessible neighbours of active residues. Active and passive residues were selected using the program Naccess, version 2.1.1. HADDOCK runs were carried out using default program parameters on a dual processor 225 MHz Silicon Graphics, Octane R10000 workstation. 1000 structures were calculated for the initial docking and 200 of these were refined for the final analysis. Total computational time was 4 weeks. Analysis of the final 200 structures was carried out using the clustering method (Dominguez et al., 2003).

Chemical shift perturbation mapping
All spectra were recorded on Bruker DMX-500 or DRX-600 instruments. 1H-15N-HSQC spectra of a 0.2 mM 15N-labelled MarA-micF complex were recorded at 35C with and without equimolar a-CTD. Chemical shift differences in the two spectra were used to identify the binding site of a-CTD on the MarA-micF complex. The identical protocol was carried out for a 0.2 mM 15N-labelled SoxS-micF sample. Similarly, an analysis of 1H-15N HSQC spectra recorded for 15N labelled aCTD, in the presence (1 : 1 stoichiometry) and absence of unlabelled MarA-micF was performed to identify the binding site of MarA-micF on a-CTD. Assignments for the MarA-micF complex were obtained from published material (Dangi et al., 2001). Assignments for the a-CTD, although published (Jeon et al., 1995) were not accessible but were kindly provided by Dr Nuria Assa-Munt and were discussed in Gaal et al. (1996). Assignments for SoxS-DNA are not available and only the side-chain e-protons of the two tryptophan residues (W13 and W36) could be assigned based on comparison with spectra of MarA-DNA. In addition to the above spectra, control spectra included 1H-15N HSQC of 15N-labelled a-CTD in the presence and absence of micF (without MarA present) and 1D spectra of 15N-labelled MarA-micF in the presence and absence of unlabelled a-CTD.

Construction and analysis of MarA mutants
Mutants of MarA were constructed and their sequence verified in plasmid pRGM9817 as previously described (Gillette et al., 2000) except that the oligonucleotides were synthesized using an ABI DNA/RNA Synthesizer. Strains were constructed and analysed as previously described (Gillette et al., 2000). b-Galactosidase assays were carried out according to Miller (1972).

Binding constants
MarA-micF, W19A-MarA-micF, W19A, R36A-MarA-micF were used to determine the dissociation constants for complexes with a-CTD. All protein samples were in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 20 mM EDTA, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 6.7. A reference 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum for 0.1 mM 15N labelled a-CTD was recorded at 35C and increasing amounts of the protein-DNA complexes were added keeping the concentration of 15N-CTD at 0.1 mM. A series of 1H-15 NHSQC spectra was recorded for each mutant. The titrations were continued until no further changes in peak positions were noted (5­6 spectra per mutant). All of the peaks appeared to shift in concert as the titration proceeded. No data for the R46A R96A mutant of MarA could be obtained because its low affinity for micF DNA made it insoluble in low salt. An analysis of the binding curve was consistent with single-site binding in the fast exchange regime (De Marco et al., 1987). Binding constants were determined by a Scatchard analysis of the data as described by Fielding (2000).

Gel retardation
Gel retardation assays were performed as previously described using the 20 bp 32P-labelled DNA fragment corresponding to the MarA binding site at the mar promoter (Gillette et al., 2000) and MarA or mutant MarA purified according to the modification of Martin et al. (2002).

MarA: a-CTD binding assays
a-CTD mutants, R265A and N294A were constructed by sitedirected mutagenesis of plasmid pRGM9946 (the pET15b derivative present in strain N9946), cloned in BL21(lDE3) pLysS (N2932 and N2933, respectively), and the sequences verified in both directions. The cells growing in superbroth were induced with 400 mM IPTG for 5 h and the wild-type and mutant a-CTD proteins purified as described above, except the His-tag was not removed. Assays for the interaction of His-tagged a-CTD with MarA were carried out as outlined diagrammatically in Fig. 3A.

Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech AB) was prepared as follows: a 1 ml suspension of sepharose resin was extensively washed with water, equilibrated with 10 mM nickel sulphate, then with water and with buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol). The nickelchelated sepharose was then suspended to a final volume of 5 ml with buffer. One hundred ml of this suspension was transferred to 0.5 ml Eppendorf microfuge tubes, spun for 1 min at 11 400 r.p.m. and the supernatant, ª 70 ml, was carefully removed. Assay mixtures were prepared as follows: ª25 mg of purified MarA and/or ª 15 mg of a-CTD were added to buffer and 40 mM imidazole in a final volume of 150 ml. One hundred ml of this mixture was added to the pelleted resin, thoroughly mixed, centrifuged as above, and the supernatants were carefully removed. Next, the pellets were washed with 100 ml of buffer containing 40 mM imidazole, and treated as above. Finally, the pellets were suspended in 100 ml of the same buffer containing 50 mM EDTA and again treated as above. For each assay mixture there were thus four samples, the input, the supernatant after adsorption to the chelating sepharose, the wash and the EDTA eluate. Thirty ml of each sample were added to 10 ml NuPage SDS Sample Buffer (4X) and 25 ml were loaded (without DTT or heating) on 4­12% Bis-Tris gels, subjected to electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie blue.
