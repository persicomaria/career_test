Key words: matrix metalloproteinase, structural genomics, Thermotoga maritima, TM1509, UPF0054, zinc-binding protein Abstract The 150-residue protein TM1509 is encoded in gene YF09_THEMA of Thermotoga maritima. TM1509 has so far no functional annotation and belongs to protein family UPF0054 (PFAM accession number: PF02130) which contains at least 146 members. The NMR structure of TM1509 reveals an a+b fold comprising a four stranded b-sheet with topology A(>), B(>), D(>), C(fl) as well as five a-helices I­V. The structures of most members of family PF02130 can be reliably constructed using the TM1509 NMR structure, demonstrating high leverage for exploration of fold space. A multiple sequence alignment of TM1509 with homologues of family UPF0054 shows that three polypeptide segments, as well as a putative zinc-binding consensus motif HGXLHLXGYDH located at the C-terminal end of a-helix IV, are highly conserved. The spatial arrangement of the three His residues of this UPF0054 consensus motif is similar to the arrangement found for the His residues in the HEXXHXXGXXH zinc-binding consensus motif of matrix metallo-proteases (MMPs). Moreover, the other conserved polypeptide segments form a large cavity which encloses the putative Zn-binding pocket and might confer specificity during catalysis. However, TM1509 and the other members of the UPF0054 family do not have the crucial Glu residue in position 2 of the MMP consensus motif. Intriguingly, the TM1509 structure indicates that the Asp in the UPF0054 consensus motif (Asp 111 in TM1509) may overtake the catalytic role of the Glu. This suggests that protein family UPF0054 might contain members of a hitherto uncharacterized class of metalloproteases.

Introduction Structural genomics aims at making three-dimensional structural information available for most

naturally occurring protein families. Here, we describe the structure of the protein TM1509 encoded in gene YF09_THEMA of Thermotoga maritima which was selected as a target of the

52 Northeast Structural Genomics consortium (NESG, http://www.nesg.org; NESGC target ID: VT1). Thermotoga maritima is a non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that was first isolated from geothermal-heated marine sediment in Vulcano, Italy, and is of importance to understand bacterial evolution. Small-subunit RNA phylogeny has placed this bacterium as one of the deepest and most slowly evolving lineages of all Eubacteria [1]. Moreover, conservation of gene order when comparing T. maritima with Archaea suggests that lateral gene transfer may have occurred between thermophilic Eubacteria and Archaea [2]. The relatively small genome of T. maritima encodes 1852 proteins. Of those, 54% have been functionally assigned [2], but only few three-dimensional protein structures have so far been reported for this organism. TM1509 belongs to the comparably large protein family UPF0054 (PFAM accession number: PF02130; at least 146 members) which does not contain any functionally characterized proteins. Sequence alignment reveals the occurrence of several highly conserved polypeptide segments in the UPF0054 family, including a putative zincbinding HGxLHLxGYDH consensus motif (Figure 1). This motif is similar to the HExxHxxGxxH zinc-binding consensus motif found in the matrix metalloprotease (MMP) superfamily, except that it does not contain a Glu residue in position 2. This residue anchors and polarizes a zinc-coordinated water molecule and is thus pivotal for MMP activity. Notably, MMPs have been studied in great detail [3] since these enzymes are involved in the genesis of various human diseases [4, 5]. (25 mM Na phosphate, pH = 6.5, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 20 lM ZnCl2, 0.01% NaN3). In addition, a U)15N and 5% biosynthetically directed fractionally 13C-labeled sample [7, 8] was generated to stereo-specifically assign Val and Leu methyl groups. Metal analysis Three equivalents of ZnCl2 were added to a 0.8 mM solution of U)15N and 5% biosynthetically directed fractionally 13C-labeled TM1509 dissolved in a Zn-free NMR buffer ($0.5 mM; 20 mM MES, pH = 6.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.01% NaN3) to ensure that Zn-binding sites are quantitatively occupied. After extensive dialysis against the Zn-free NMR buffer to remove the excess of Zn2+, ICP-MS (Agilent Technologies 4500 ICP-MS) analysis measured $0.9 mM of zinc in the TM1509 solution. This finding shows that Zn2+ is tightly bound to TM1509 at 1:1 stoichiometry. NMR experiments NMR experiments were recorded at 25 °C on Varian INOVA 600 MHz and 750 MHz spectrometers equipped with conventional 1 H{13C,15N} triple-resonance probes. The spectra were processed with the programs NMRPipe [9] and PROSA [10], and were analyzed using the program XEASY [11]. Resonance assignments were obtained from 3D CBCA(CO)NHN, 3D HNNCACB, 3D HNNCO, aliphatic 3D H(C)CH COSY and 3D (H)CCH-TOCSY [12], and reduced-dimensionality 3D HNNCAHA and HACA(CO)NHN [13]. Aromatic spin systems were assigned by analyzing heteronuclear resolved [1H,1H]-NOESY [12]. 1H­1H upper distance limit constraints were extracted from 3D 15 N-resolved [1H,1H]-NOESY [12] (mixing time: 70 ms), and aliphatic and aromatic 13C-resolved [1H,1H]-NOESY [12] (mixing time: 80 ms). Slowly exchanging backbone amide protons were identified by lyophilizing part of the sample containing U)15N/5% 13C-labeled protein, dissolving the protein in D2O and acquiring a 2D [15N,1H] HSQC spectrum. 2D constant time (ct) [13C,1H]-HSQC spectroscopy [14, 15] is required to resolve signals arising from the large number (27) of Val and

Materials and methods Protein sample preparation Uniformly (U) 13C,15N-labeled TM1509 was produced as described previously [6] and contains a 23-residue N-terminal tag with sequence MGTSH6SSGRENLYFQGHS in order to facilitate purification by using Ni-chelate affinity chromatography. The resulting polypeptide expressed for the NMR structural study has a molecular weight of 21 kDa. U)13C,15N TM1509 was concentrated to $1 mM in 90% H2O/10% D2O

Leu isopropyl groups of TM1509, and was employed for the 5% biosynthetically directed 13 C fractionally labeled sample. However, at a ct delay of 28 ms, pro-R and pro-S signals exhibit opposite sign [16] which leads to mutual cancellation. Hence, we recorded 2D ct-[13C,1H]-HSQC spectra with two different ct delays at 1/1JCC = 28 ms and 3/21JCC = 42 ms. This allows one to increase the fraction of stereo-specifically

assigned groups, since pro-S signals decay solely due to T2(13C) spin relaxation while pro-R signals also reflect modulation by a passive one-bond 13 C)13C scalar coupling. As a result, only pro-S signals are detected at a ct delay of 42 ms. An approximate overall isotropic rotational correlation time of sr $17 ns (25 °C) was inferred for protein TM1509 from 15N T1/T1q nuclear spin relaxation time ratios at 600 MHz

54 H resonance frequency [13]. This is $2-fold ($1.5-fold) longer than predicted by hydrodynamic theory [17] for an isotropically (anisotropically with axial symmetry) tumbling protein molecule of 21 kDa molecular weight. This discrepancy indicates the presence of transient protein aggregation in solution that leads to significant NMR line broadening. Structure calculations NOESY cross-peak volumes were converted into proton-proton upper distance limits and /-angle constraints using the program DYANA [18]. / and u backbone dihedral angle constraints were derived from chemical shifts using the program TALOS [19] for polypeptide segments where the same type of constraint (a-helical or b-strand) was obtained for at least three consecutive residues. For selected slowly exchanging backbone amide protons with well resolved signals in 2D [15N,1H] HSQC, hydrogen bond constraints were derived when supported by NOE derived distance constraints. Stereospecific assignments for 1 b H and Gly 1Ha were obtained (i) by performing grid searches considering NOE upper distance limit and chemical shift derived angle constraints using the FOUND module of the program DYANA, and (ii) by analysis of NOE intensities using the GLOMSA module of DYANA [18]. The final round of DYANA structure calculations employing torsion angle dynamics was started with 100 random conformers and 30,000 annealing steps. The 20 structures with the lowest target functions were selected to represent the NMR solution structure. The program MOLMOL [20] was used to calculate r.m.s.d. values and to generate Figure 4. Structural bioinformatics The first iteration of the PSI-BLAST search [21] for sequence homologues of TM1509 in the nonredundant (nr) protein sequence database used the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix [22] and gap existence and extension penalties of 11 and 1, respectively. In subsequent searches, an e-value threshold of 0.0005 was applied for including sequences in the position-specific scoring matrix. The program ClustalW [23] was used to generate a multiple sequence alignment of the TM1509
1

sequence with 25 randomly selected sequences homologues of protein family UPF0054 and protein AQ1354 (Figure 1), for which an X-ray crystal structure was solved while this work was in progress (PDB ID: 1OZ9). The program ConSurf [24,25] was used to map sequence conservation reflected in this multiple sequence onto the TM1509 structure. The programs GRASP [26] and SURFNET [27] were used, respectively, to calculate surfaces curvatures and the sizes of surface cavities. The program Modeller [28] was used to construct homology models for each of the 175 sequence homologues that resulted from the iterative PSI-BLAST search. The quality of each of the models was evaluated by using the program ProsaII [29]. This program scores structures according to how well each residue fits into its structural environment based on criteria derived from statistical analysis of high resolution structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).

Results and discussion Resonance and NOE assignment Virtually complete resonance assignments were obtained for the polypeptide backbone (Figure 2), while only 91% of the side-chain resonances were assigned (Table 1; chemical shift data were deposited in the BioMagResBank with accession number 6256). As a result of (i) the incomplete side-chain assignment and (ii) the comparably short nuclear spin relaxation times (see Methods section), about one third of the cross peaks could not be assigned in heteronuclear (15N, 13Cali or 13Caro) resolved [1H,1H]-NOESY. To obtain nonetheless a good quality NMR structure, in particular for the protein's core which plays an important role for homology modeling, it was desirable to maximize the number of stereo-specifically assigned methyl groups of the 13 Val and 14 Leu residues of TM1509. This was achieved by recording 2D ct-[13C,1H]-HSQC spectra with two different ct-delays (Figure 3) for 5% fractionally 13C-labeled TM1509. This approach allows one to edit pro-R and pro-S signal and yielded assignments for methyl groups in 10

Val and 11 Leu residues. Considering that 12 Val and 14 Leu residues exhibit non-degenerate methyl proton chemical shifts, we thus obtained stereo-specific assignments for 81% of the isopropyl moieties. The stereo-specific assignment of the methyl groups of one additional Val and Leu residue (increasing the yield to 88%; Table 1) as well as of 19% of the 1Hb proton pairs with non-degenerate chemical shifts were accomplished using the GLOMSA module of the program DYANA [18].

NMR solution structure of TM1509 The NMR structure of TM1509 was calculated on the basis of 1765 NMR-derived constraints. 1547 conformationally-restricting 1H)1H upper distance limit constraints were derived from NOESY, 207 backbone dihedral angle constraints were obtained from chemical shifts [19], and 11 hydrogen-bond constraints were inferred for slowly-exchanging amide protons. The statistics of the structure determination are summarized in

56 Table 1, indicating a good quality NMR structure. As expected, the precision of the structure calculation profited from the large number of stereospecific assignments: omission of these assignments yields about 15­20% increased r.m.s.d. values. In view of the comparably low costs of 5% fractional 13C-labeling, it thus appears attractive to routinely use this methodology for highthroughput NMR structure determination in structural genomics. The NMR structure of TM1509 was submitted to the PDB (1TVI), and a superposition of the 20 best DYANA conformers is shown in Figure 4a. TM1509 exhibits an a+b fold (Figure 4b) comprising a four stranded b-sheet with topology A(>), B(>), D(>), C(fl) as well as five a-helices I to V. b-Strands A (residues 2­6), B (34­38) and D (74­76) are arranged in a parallel fashion and are followed, respectively, by a-helices I (11­28), II (41­51) and III (80­87). Notably, the first ahelix is significantly kinked at residue 17. The short b-strand C comprises residues 60 to 62 and is attached in an anti-parallel manner to b-strand D. a-Helices IV and V contain residues 92­107 and 120­137, respectively, and are located in conjunction with a-helices I and III on one side of the b-sheet. a-Helix IV forms the central part of the protein and is surrounded by the other regular secondary structure elements. Plots of local backbone r.m.s.d. values and global backbone displacements are provided in Figure 5. These demonstrate that the regular secondary elements are well defined, while local and global conformational disorder are observed for polypeptide segments 63­72 (i.e., the loop connecting b-strands C and D) and 109­119 (i.e., the loop connecting a-helices IV and V), as well as for the C-terminal tridecapeptide segment. The multiple sequence alignment of TM1509 with representative sequence homologues (Figure 1) reveals a correlation of sequence conservation with the location of the secondary structure elements, in particular for residues 34­38 (strand B), 51­64 (loop connecting helix III and strand C) and 70­77 (part of the loop preceding strand D and strand D). The UPF0054 family consensus motif HGXLHLXGYDH represents a putative Zn-binding site and is located at residues 102­112, that is, at the C-terminal end of helix IV and the beginning of the following loop.

In (a), this signal is overlapped with the peak arising from the pro-R methyl group of Leu 79.

An iterative PSI-BLAST search with the sequence of TM1509 converged after three iterations and yielded 175 sequence homologues. The quality assessment outlined in the `Methods' section revealed that reliable homology models could be obtained for 160 of these homologues when using the DYANA conformer with the lowest residual target function as a template. This demonstrates that the NMR solution structure of TM1509 has a high `leverage value' for exploration of protein fold space. Structural homologues of TM1509 A search of the PDB using the program DALI [30] identified the X-ray crystal structure of AQ1354 as a structural homologue [31] (Z-score: ° 9.7; r.m.s.d.: 4 A for 130 aligned residues; 26% sequence identity). AQ1354 is a protein from Aquifex aeolicus with unknown function. Its Xray structure was submitted to PDB while the NMR structure determination was nearing completion, and could thus not be considered for target selection. Like TM1509, AQ1354 is a member of protein family UPF0054. A search for struc-

ture homologues using the program 3D-PSSM [32] reveals solely AQ1354 (1OZ9) as a significant hit, while the program CE [33] also detects zinc-dependent thermolysin (Z-score: 4.9) and various MMPs such collegenase, stromelysin and gelatinase (Z-scores: $4.0). Topology of putative zinc-binding UPF0054 consensus motif The identification of MMPs as remote structural homologues of TM1509 and AQ1354 indicates that the sequence similarity of the UPF0054 family consensus motif HGxLHLxGYDH and the MMP consensus motif HGxLHLxGYDH (Figure 1) is possibly paralleled by similarities in terms of Zn coordination and protein function. In both consensus motifs we have three His residues that are available for Zn binding. The X-ray structures of MMPs reveal that, in spite of low overall sequence identity, similar protein architectures and a virtually identical structural environment surrounding the Zn-ion are observed. This includes a common `Met b-turn' that was described in [34] and [35]. In all MMPs,

Zn is coordinated in a tetrahedral manner with three His residues and a water molecule, which itself is polarized by a Glu side chain located immediately downstream to the first His of the MMP consensus motif [36]. The Met residue alluded to above is located in a turn about 20 residues downstream from the second His of the MMP consensus motif and affords hydrophobic packing for the three His side chains. These salient structural features characterizing the active site of MMPs are displayed for three-disulfide hemorrhagic zinc MP Autolysin A (1BSW) in Figure 6a. Like the MMP consensus motif, the UPF0054 motif contains three conserved His residues (Figure 1). Unfortunately, the third His 112 in TM1509 belonging to this consensus motif is located in a disordered loop connecting helices IV and V so that the relative orientation of the three His residues is not available at high resolution. Nonetheless, the inspection of TM1509 NMR and AQ1354 X-ray crystal structure indicates two remarkable structural variations of the putative Zn-binding sites when compared with hith-

erto solved MMP structures. First, the UPF0054 motif possesses a Gly instead of the catalytic Glu in position 2. Hence, an acidic side chain for anchoring the water molecule for Zn coordination has to be supplied by a different residue. Indeed, the UPF0054 motif contains an Asp residue (Figure 1) immediately upstream of the third conserved His. Intriguingly, the spatial location of this Asp side chain in the AQ1354 and TM1509 protein structures is quite similar to that of the catalytic Glu in MMPs. Hence, this Asp can potentially function as the catalytic Glu in MMPs (Figure 6). This view is further supported by the observation that a bound water molecule is observed in the structure of AQ1354 in the vicinity of this Asp. In agreement with these considerations, one tightly bound Zn2+ per protein molecule was detected by ICP-MS analysis. Moreover, a DYANA structure calculation of protein TM1509 including constraints for tetrahedral coordination of a Zn-ion with the three His side-chains and a water molecule lead only to a very small increase of the DYANA target function value. This

demonstrates that the experimental constraints collected for the solution structure TM1509 are in neat agreement with the tetrahedral Zn coordination found in the crystal structure of MMPs. Second, the Met residue which is conserved in MMPs is located in a b-turn after the catalytic helix comprising the first two His. In TM1509, the conserved Met residue of the UPF0054 family (replaced by a Phe in AQ1354; Figure 1) is located in an a-helix. Nonetheless, the Met residue of TM1509 (and the corresponding Phe residue in protein AQ1354) provides the hydrophobic packing previously described for stabilizing the Zn-binding motif of MMPs (Figure 6).

Substrate binding site The structures of TM1509 and AQ1354 strongly suggest that both proteins function as Zn metalloproteases (Figure 7). Hence, it is likely that sequence conservation in protein family UPF0054 also reflects conservation of substrate specificity. The program Consurf [22, 23] allows detection of structurally conserved motifs, and analysis of the TM1509 and AQ1354 structures reveals that conserved regions are located in b-beta strands C and D, and in helix IV (Figure 7a,b). These structural motifs form a contiguous conserved surface patch, consistent with an

In (a), the level of sequence conservation is semi-quantitatively depicted by color, graded from purple (most highly conserved) to blue (least conserved). Three conserved regions (Figure 1) are located in b-strands C and D, and a-helix IV (blue arrow), respectively. For clarity, the location of the Zn-binding site is indicated by a yellow circle in (b). In (c), surface clefts are displayed on the left in green with residues being colored as in (a). For clarity, only the clefts are shown on the right and active site is indicated by a yellow arrow.

important role for molecular recognition. Furthermore, the surface curvature of TM1509 calculated using the program GRASP [26] reveals a large cleft (Figure 7c, left), which is located within the most conserved surface (Figure 7b) and which also contains the putative Zn binding site. Similarly, the program SURFNET [27] identifies this cleft as being the largest cavity of TM1509 (Figure 7c, Right), further supporting the notion that this cleft contains the active site.

Conclusions The NMR solution structure of TM1509 provides a structural basis for understanding sequence conservation in protein family UPF0054, and its comparison with the X-ray structure of protein AQ1354 exhibiting only 26% sequence identity with TM1509 was particularly illuminating. Taken together, our analyses suggest that TM1509 and AQ1354 represent a so far uncharacterized class of

61 Zn-metalloproteinases. We find that Zn-coordination in the putative active site very likely occurs quite similarly as in previously characterized MMPs, and that the catalytic Glu is likely replaced by an Asp residue. Moreover, packing and spatial stabilization of the three Zn coordinating His residues is supported by Met or Phe sidechains as in MMPs. Notably, both the TM1509 and the AQ1354 structure were solved by structural genomics consortia funded by the `Protein Structure Initiative' of the National Institutes of Health (http://www.nigms.nih.gov/psi/). We expect that the availability of two templates will allow researchers to obtain high quality homology models for sequence homologues of the two proteins, thus exemplifying synergy of NMR spectroscopy and X-ray structure analysis in structural genomics.
