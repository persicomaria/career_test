Abstract The peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) define a superfamily of thiol-dependent peroxidases able to reduce hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrite. Besides their cytoprotective antioxidant function, PRDXs have been implicated in redox signaling and chaperone activity, the latter depending on the formation of decameric high-molecular-weight structures. PRDXs have been mechanistically divided into three major subfamilies, namely typical 2-Cys, atypical 2-Cys, and 1-Cys PRDXs, based on the number and position of cysteines involved in the catalysis. We report the structure of the C45S mutant of annelid worm Arenicola marina PRDX6 in three different crystal forms determined at 1.6, ° 2.0, and 2.4 A resolution. Although A. marina PRDX6 was cloned during the search of annelid homologs of mammalian 1-Cys PRDX6s, the crystal structures support its assignment to the mechanistically typical 2-Cys PRDX subfamily. The protein is composed of two distinct domains: a C-terminal domain and an N-terminal domain exhibiting a thioredoxin fold. The subunits are associated in dimers compatible with the formation of intersubunit disulfide bonds between the peroxidatic and the resolving cysteine residues in the wild-type enzyme. The packing of two crystal forms is very similar, with pairs of dimers associated as tetramers. The toroid-shaped decamers formed by dimer association and observed in most typical 2-Cys PRDXs is not present. Thus, A. marina PRDX6 presents structural features of typical 2-Cys PRDXs without any formation of toroid-shaped decamers, suggesting that it should function more like a cytoprotective antioxidant enzyme or a modulator of peroxide-dependent cell signaling rather than a molecular chaperone.

Besides classical cellular antioxidant enzymes involved in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides in animal cells, such as glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) and catalase (CAT), peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) have emerged more recently as a major superfamily of

evolutionarily conserved peroxidases (Hofmann et al. 2002; Wood et al. 2002; Rhee et al. 2005a). PRDXs are selenium- and heme-free peroxidases that depend on cysteines for their catalytic activity (for review, see Wood et al. 2003). Mechanistically, PRDXs have been classified into three subfamilies depending on the number and the position of cysteines implicated in the catalysis. All PRDXs contain a conserved peroxidatic cysteine residue in the N-terminal domain of the protein. During the catalytic cycle, the peroxidatic cysteine is first oxidized by peroxide or peroxynitrite to sulfenic acid. Then, this intermediate is transformed either by forming a disulfide bond with a resolving C-terminal cysteine of another subunit (typical 2-Cys subfamily) or the same subunit (atypical 2-Cys subfamily). In the 1-Cys subfamily, only an N-terminal peroxidatic cysteine is present in the enzyme, and the sulfenic acid of the peroxidatic cysteine is reduced by a heterologous thiol-containing reductant such as glutathione. Functionally, PRDXs are important cytoprotective antioxidant enzymes, although their reactivity with peroxides has been previously questioned compared with GPXs and CAT (Hofmann et al. 2002). However, reassessments of the kinetic values have shown that PRDXs may exhibit high catalytic efficiencies compatible with their role as cytoprotective antioxidant enzymes (Parsonage et al. 2005; Oguscu et al. 2007; Peskin et al. 2007; Trujillo et al. 2007). Mammalian typical 2-Cys PRDXs have been also implicated as regulators of redox signaling due to their ability to be reversibly inactivated by peroxides during the catalytic process that accommodates the intracellular messenger function of hydrogen peroxide (Rhee et al. 2005b). Finally, more recently, bacteria, yeast, and human 2-Cys PRDXs have been shown to act alternatively as peroxidases and molecular chaperones, the functional switch necessitating the formation of toroid-shaped homodecamers and highmolecular-weight complexes (Jang et al. 2004; Chuang et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2007). In search of a homolog of mammalian 1-Cys PRDX6 in the marine annelid Arenicola marina, we have cloned and initiated the biochemical characterization of a PRDX with high sequence homology with mammalian PRDX6s (E. Loumaye, A. Andersen, A. Clippe, H. Degand, M. Dubuisson, F. Zal, P. Morsomme, J.F. Rees, and B. Knoops, in prep.). Interestingly, although A. marina PRDX6 presents 63% identity and 85% similarity with human 1-Cys PRDX6, the protein possesses five cysteines, among which two cysteines function as peroxidatic and resolving cysteines of typical 2-Cys PRDXs (E. Loumaye, A. Andersen, A. Clippe, H. Degand, M. Dubuisson, F. Zal, P. Morsomme, J.F. Rees, and B. Knoops, in prep.). The crystal structures of the C45S mutant of annelid worm Arenicola marina PRDX6 presented here support its assignment to the mechanistically

typical 2-Cys subfamily without any formation of toroidshaped decamers. A similar situation was already observed for the archaeal PRDX from Aeropyrum pernix K1, but with the formation of toroid-shaped decamers (Mizohata et al. 2005). Results and Discussion Quality of the models We report here the crystal structure of the C45S mutant of Arenicola marina PRDX6 in three different crystal forms. The first two forms are monoclinic with four monomers (A­D) in the asymmetric unit, and the last one is orthorhombic with eight monomers (A­H) in the asymmetric unit. In all cases, pairs of monomers are associated to form dimers. In the monoclinic structures, the electron density is usually well defined along the protein chain except for the first residue at the N-terminal part and a few residues (including the 63His tag) at the C-terminal part of the polypeptides. The situation is similar for the first four chains (A­D) of the orthorhombic structure, but in the four remaining chains (E­H) the electron density is poorly defined in some loop (residues 188­201), and in this region the structural model was built according to the well-defined chains. The Ramachandran diagrams computed by the program Molprobity (Lovell et al. 2003) indicate that about 98% of the residues lie in favored regions and that all of them adopt an allowed conformation. All the monomers are very similar, as well as their association to form dimers. For this reason, one monomer and one dimer from the first monoclinic form were selected for a detailed description since the resolution ° of 1.6 A achieved for this structure is substantially higher ° ° than the two other ones (2.0 A and 2.4 A). The availability of three different crystal structures remains important, however, because they will present differences in the packing of the dimers. Indeed, it has been shown that in the case of typical 2-Cys PRDXs, the oligomerization of the dimers may play an important role in the redox mechanism and that enzyme activity could be linked to the oligomeric state (Alphey et al. 2000; Schroder et al. ¨ 2000; Wood et al. 2002; Parsonage et al. 2005). Structure of the monomer In the first monoclinic crystal form, the average RMS deviation between the Ca atoms of the four chains is 0.184 ° A, and chain B can be considered as the ``central subunit'' ° with an average RMS deviation of 0.165 A between this chain and the three other ones. Figure 1 shows the fold of this monomer and a topological diagram. The structure is composed of two domains. The N-terminal domain 1

(residues 1­169) is characterized by the presence of a thioredoxin fold. It is composed of a central four-stranded b-sheet (b4, b3, b8, b9) flanked by three a-helices (a2, a4, a5). Domain 1 is completed at its N terminus by a short b-sheet (b1, b2) and by the short helix a1. Between b4 and a4 of the thioredoxin fold there is an insertion of helix a3 and of strand b5 that runs parallel to the b4 strand of the thioredoxin fold and thus constitutes a fifth strand associated with the thioredoxin fold motif. There is an additional insertion of a short two-stranded b-sheet (b6, b7) between helix a4 and strand b8. The C-terminal domain 2 (residues 170­220) is connected at the C-terminal end of the a5 helix belonging to the thioredoxin fold. It is composed of a four-stranded antiparallel 702

b-sheet (b10, b11, b13, b12) and one a-helix (a6) located between strands b11 and b12. There are only a very few intrasubunit contacts between the two domains. They involve residues located in helix a5 in domain 1 and in the loop between b10 and b11 in domain 2. Hydrogen bonds are formed between Ser162 Og and Thr173 Og1 and between Arg158 Nh1 and the carbonyl oxygen of Trp177. A. marina PRDX6 presents 63% identity with human PRDX6 (hORF6), whose crystal structure has been determined and corresponds to PDB code 1prx (Choi et al. 1998). The folds of these two monomers of PRDX6 are very similar: 195 residues can be aligned with an RMS ° deviation of 0.97 A between the Ca atoms. Large differences occur mainly in domain 1, in two regions that do not belong to the thioredoxin fold: the loop between a3 and b5, and the short two-stranded b-sheet (b6, b7), which is a unique feature of A. marina PRDX6 and is replaced by a large loop without secondary structure in human PRDX6. Human PRDX6 belongs to the 1-Cys subfamily of PRDXs. According to the sequence homology, it was initially supposed that A. marina PRDX6 would also belong to this subfamily. However, it has been shown that from a mechanistic point of view this enzyme must be classified into typical 2-Cys PRDXs (E. Loumaye, A. Andersen, A. Clippe, H. Degand, M. Dubuisson, F. Zal, P. Morsomme, J.F. Rees, and B. Knoops, in prep.). The crystal structure of another PRDX showing the same particularity is already known: The primary sequence of the archaeal PRDX from Aeropyrum pernix K1 is similar to those of the 1-Cys PRDXs, while its catalytic properties resemble those of the typical 2-Cys PRDXs (Mizohata et al. 2005). The wild-type A. marina PRDX6 contains five Cys residues in positions 45, 71, 86, 127, and 183. It was proposed that Cys45 could be the peroxidatic cysteine and Cys183 the resolving cysteine (E. Loumaye, A. Andersen, A. Clippe, H. Degand, M. Dubuisson, F. Zal, P. Morsomme, J.F. Rees, and B. Knoops, in prep.). It seemed interesting to examine how these Cys residues are positioned in comparison with the structures of PRDXs belonging to different subfamilies. A multiple structural alignment was thus worked out using the program Mustang (Konagurthu et al. 2006) and applied to the present molecule and to PRDXs belonging to different subfamilies. The results are given in Table 1. It can be seen that all peroxidatic cysteine residues are well aligned in the structures. Furthermore, three of the four additional cysteine residues of A. marina PRDX6 are aligned with cysteine residues of Plasmodium yoelii PRDX. However, except for the latter, none of the additional cysteine residues of A. marina PRDX6, including the resolving residue Cys183, structurally corresponds to a cysteine residue in the other PRDXs structures. Based on SDS-PAGE analysis and on mass spectrometry results, it was proposed that in A. marina PRDX6, an intrasubunit

disulfide bond could be formed between Cys71 and Cys127, but only when Cys45 is present in the enzyme (E. Loumaye, A. Andersen, A. Clippe, H. Degand, M. Dubuisson, F. Zal, P. Morsomme, J.F. Rees, and B. Knoops, in prep.). In the present structure of the C45S mutant, we confirm the absence of this disulfide bond in all the monomers. Crystals were grown in the presence of DTT, thus favoring the absence of a disulfide bond, but the crystal of the monoclinic form 2 was soaked in H2O2 before data collection. Even in this case, a disulfide bond between Cys71 and Cys127 is missing. The formation of this hypothetical disulfide bond would require important structural rearrangements. As can be seen in Figure 1, the two residues are not very close to each other, with a ° distance of 10.2 A between the two sulfur atoms, and the side chain of Cys127 is not oriented in the direction of Cys71. The two residues are located at the extremity of b-strands b4 and b8, respectively. These two strands belong to the thioredoxin fold. They are not direct neighbors in the b-sheet since they are separated by strand b3.

One can thus expect a considerable rearrangement at the level of the thioredoxin fold if this intrasubunit disulfide bond is formed. The active site In the present study, the conserved peroxidatic residue Cys45 is mutated into a Ser. As is the case in all the reduced forms of PRDX structures, this residue is located in the N-terminal part of the kinked a2 helix, in a positively charged pocket. The Og oxygen atom of Ser45 is in direct contact with the side chains of Arg128, Thr42, His37, and the carboxylate group of a benzoate ion that covers the entrance of the pocket. The side chain of Arg151 is not in direct contact with Ser45 Og but also lies in the vicinity. In the wild-type enzyme, the surroundings of Cys45 would thus be very similar to what is observed in other PRDXs, with the exception of the benzoate ion, which was observed only in the crystal structure of human PRDX5 (Declercq and Evrard 2001; Declercq et al. 2001;

Evrard et al. 2004a) and in the C47S mutant of the same enzyme (Evrard et al. 2004b). As can be seen on the structural alignment presented in Table 1, Arg128 and Thr42 are conserved in all the PRDXs presented here, while the equivalent of His37 is missing only in human PRDX2. Arg151 is also well conserved. Figure 2 shows a view of the accessible surface of a monomer, colored according to the electrostatic potential. The presence of arginine and histidine residues is thus responsible for the positively charged pocket and for lowering the pKa of the peroxydatic cysteine Cys45 in the wild type. The presence of a benzoate ion was completely unexpected since benzoate was never used during the production, the purification, or the crystallization. In the case of human PRDX5, the presence of the benzoate in the protein sample before crystallization was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The presence of the benzoate in the C45S mutant of A. marina PRDX6 thus suggests that it should probably also be present in the wild-type enzyme. As shown in Figure 2B, the benzoate is positioned at the entrance of the pocket containing the active site and at least partially obstructs its access. The carboxylate oxy-

gen atoms of the benzoate are hydrogen bound with residues belonging to the active site: O1 to Val44 N ° ° ° (2.91 A), O2 to Thr42 Og1 (2.88 A), Ser45 N (2.94 A), g ° ), and Arg128 Nh2 (2.86 A). These ° Ser45 O (3.09 A bonds are exactly equivalent to those described in human PRDX5 (Evrard et al. 2004b). A very similar situation was also described in the crystal structure of chloroperoxidase from Streptomyces aureofaciens Tu24, in which ¨ an organic acid is required for the haloperoxidase activity (Hofmann et al. 1998). In spite of the crystallization pH (5.5), it seems that the O2 atom of the benzoate is protonated because Thr42 Og1 takes part in three hydrogen bonds: It is the donor in a bond with the carbonyl ° oxygen atom of Arg39 (2.70 A) and thus an acceptor in g ° the bonds with Ser45 O (3.14 A) and the benzoate O2 ° ). It is thus likely that the neighborhood of the (2.88 A benzoate has increased its pKa value (4.2). In the crystal structure of human PRDX5, it was noticed that the aromatic ring of the benzoate ion was in contact with hydrophobic residues belonging to helix a5, which is a characteristic of PRDX5, since it is not observed in other PRDX structures. Interestingly, in A. marina PRDX6, this

region is occupied by a short two-stranded b-sheet (b6-b7) that is not frequently observed in PRDXs but is present in the typical 2-Cys PRDX AhpC (Wood et al. 2002). The shortest contact of the aromatic ring is with Glu117 Cd ° (3.30 A), which belongs to the b6 strand. The exact role of this benzoate has not been elucidated up to now, but it was speculated (Karplus and Hall 2007) that it could bind as a substrate analog, with the two carboxylate oxygens mimicking the two oxygen positions of a peroxide substrate. Structure of the dimers In the crystal structure of C91S-hORF6 (Choi et al. 1998), the association of monomers to form homodimers was reported. In this structure, each monomer is composed of two domains, a large N-terminal domain (domain 1) that contains a thioredoxin fold, and a smaller C-terminal domain (domain 2). In the dimer association, domain 2 of one monomer folds over domain 1 of the other to form an arm-exchanged dimer (Choi et al. 1998). The dimer formation implies a hydrogen-bonding network between two b-strands, one from each monomer, to form a central 10-stranded b-sheet. This big b-sheet is stabilized by intersubunit interactions between hydrophobic residues of the two involved b-strands (Choi et al. 1998). Similar dimers are present in every crystal form of A. marina PRDX6. The structure of the crystal of monoclinic form 1 is used to describe the dimer (subunits A and B have been chosen) (Fig. 3A). As in the crystal structure of C91ShORF6 (Choi et al. 1998), both monomers of a dimer are related by a non-crystallographic twofold symmetry axis. The estimation of the accessible surface by the solvent in the dimer was calculated by AREAIMOL (Lee and Richards 1971). The dimer formation decreases the acces° sible surface by an average value of 2323 A2 per monomer. That represents up to 20.5% of the total surface of the monomer. This value is somewhat bigger than the one reported in the crystal structure of C91S-hORF6 (Choi et al. 1998). Phe 41, Thr 42, Pro 43, Val 44, Thr 46, Thr 47, Glu 48, Asp 83, Cys 86, and Leu 87 of domain 1 of one subunit interact with Thr 148, Asn 152, Glu 155, and Thr 166 of domain 1 and with Ala 175, Met 184, Pro 187, Lys 204, Pro 207, and Tyr 215 of domain 2 of the other subunit. These interactions are very similar to those found in the C91ShORF6 dimer (Choi et al. 1998). At the time of the formation of the arm-exchanged dimer, the two b-strands (b9) of each monomer are associated by the hydrogenbonding network. These interactions lead to the formation of the central 10-stranded b-sheet (b3, b4, b5, b8, b9 of each monomer) (Fig. 3A). The dimer is also stabilized by intersubunit interactions between hydrophobic residues belonging to the two b9 strands (Leu 141, Ile 143, Leu 144, and Tyr 145) as reported in the crystal structure of C91S-hORF6 (Choi et al. 1998). According to the new clas-

sification proposed by Copley et al. (2004), the presence of this dimer would place A. marina PRDX6 and human PRDX6 in class 4, to which also belong typical 2-Cys PRDXs represented in Table 1 by human PRDX2. Indeed, the definition of class 4 includes the active site motif TxxCxxE, the formation of the 10-stranded b-sheet, and the presence of a C-terminal extension (Copley et al. 2004). Oligomerization It has recently been shown that, from a mechanistic point of view, A. marina PRDX6 must be classified into typical 2-Cys PRDXs (E. Loumaye, A. Andersen, A. Clippe, H. Degand, M. Dubuisson, F. Zal, P. Morsomme, J.F. Rees, and B. Knoops, in prep.). In this subfamily of PRDXs, a redox-sensitive oligomeric state exists (Wood et al. 2002, 2003). Toroid-shaped complexes consisting of a pentameric arrangement of dimers ([a2]5 decamer) are observed when the intersubunit disulfide bond between the peroxydatic Cys residue of one monomer and the resolving Cys residue of the other monomer of the dimer does not exist. This arrangement is thus present when the peroxidatic Cys residue is reduced (­SH) or overoxidized to sulfinic (ÀSO2H) or sulfonic acid (­SO3H). When the disulfide bridge is present, the N-terminal part of helix a2 containing the peroxidatic Cys residue is unwound and the complementary contact between regions I and II of two adjacent a2 dimers is lost. The consequence is a tendency toward dissociation of the pentamer of dimers (Wood et al. 2002).

Region I is part of the conserved loop helix active site motif, and region II approximately corresponds to helix a3. Complementary contacts also exist between region III (the loop between b5 and a4) and region IV (part of the loop following a4, which in A. marina PRDX6 is characterized by the presence of short two-stranded b-sheets composed of b6 and b7). In the present study of the C45S mutant of A. marina PRDX6, the mutation of the peroxidatic Cys45 into Ser45 prevents the possibility of oxidation, and the Nterminal part of helix a2 remains folded. One would thus expect that the contacts between regions I and II and between regions III and IV can occur and generate the formation of a toroid-shaped decamer. This expectation is further reinforced by the fact that these contacts are also observed in dimers of human PRDX5 belonging to the atypical 2-Cys subgroup. In that case, they do not generate decamers because the dimers associating the two central b-sheets do not exist in PRDX5 (Declercq et al. 2001). In spite of this, we must notice that the toroid-shaped decamers do not exist in any of the crystal forms of A. marina PRDX6 described here. On the other hand, the archaeal PRDX from Aeropyrum pernix K1 is also a PRDX whose primary sequence is similar to those of 1-Cys PRDXs. Archaeal PRDX catalytic properties resemble those of the typical 2-Cys PRDXs, and the toroid-shaped decamer is observed in the crystal structure (Mizohata et al. 2005). The absence of the toroid-shaped decamer in A. marina PRDX6 seems to be due to the overcrowding of the zone corresponding to the region IV defined by Wood et al. (2002). This region corresponds to the loop between the two b-strands b6 and b7. In Figure 4, we have simulated the association of two monomers belonging to two different dimers. We have superposed them on the equivalent fragments of the reduced human PRDX2 (1qmv) in which the decamer is formed. It can be seen that this association is not allowed because region IV of A. marina PRDX6 is very bulky, and several close contacts would

exist with the adjacent monomer. The complementarity between the surfaces of regions I and II of two adjacent monomers is also lost. For example, in our superposition, the side chain of Phe41 belonging to region I is positioned ° at a short distance (2.51 A) from the side chain of Glu79 belonging to region II in the adjacent monomer. The association observed in typical 2-Cys PRDXs is thus not possible in A. marina PRDX6. In the case of A. marina PRDX6, the packing of the dimers is completely different in the monoclinic forms compared with the orthorhombic form. In both monoclinic forms, two dimers are associated to form a tetramer. The accessible surface buried in this association ° is 460 A2 per monomer (4.1% of the total surface) for ° chains A and C and 175 A2 (1.5%) for chains B and D. The domain 2 of the monomers is very much implicated in the formation of the tetramers. There is a strong salt bridge between Arg182 Nh2 of chain A and Asp181 Od1 ° of chain D (2.89 A) and between Arg182 Nh2 of chain C d1 ° and Asp181 O of chain B (2.95 A), and a weaker e interaction between Arg182 N of chain D and Glu202 ° Oe1 of chain A (3.32 A) and between Arg182 Ne of chain e1 ° B and Glu202 O of chain C (3.45 A). The distances were collected in monoclinic form I. There are only a few contacts between the tetramers. In both monoclinic forms, tetramers are aligned along a line parallel to the a-axis of the cell. The only difference between the two forms is the relative disposition of two adjacent lines of tetramers. It appears that the line close to the origin is exactly the same in both forms, but the adjacent line has slid along the a-axis. In the orthorhombic form, the tetramers do not appear, and the contacts necessary to generate the toroid-shaped decamer are also nonexistent. No particular arrangement is observed, and each dimer is surrounded by a variable number of other chains (between five and eight). Simulation of the oxidized form From a mechanistic point of view, A. marina PRDX6 has been described as a typical 2-Cys PRDX, in which, upon oxidation, an intersubunit disulfide bond is formed between the peroxidatic and the resolving cysteine residues (E. Loumaye, A. Andersen, A. Clippe, H. Degand, M. Dubuisson, F. Zal, P. Morsomme, J.F. Rees, and B. Knoops, in prep.). In the wild-type A. marina PRDX6, these residues are Cys45 and Cys183, respectively. Up to now, all the trials to grow crystals of wild-type A. marina PRDX6 were unsuccessful. It is thus not possible to obtain an experimental structure showing this disulfide bond. In the present structure of the C45S mutant, the distance between Ser45 Og of one chain of a dimer and ° Cys183 Sg of the other chain is ;14.9 A. Of course, this distance is much too large to allow the formation of a

Figure 4. Ca traces of two monomers belonging to two different dimers in reduced human PRDX2 are represented by green and cyan, respectively. This association gives rise to the formation of the toroid-shaped decamer. Two monomers of A. marina PRDX6 superposed on the two monomers of PRDX2 are shown in red and blue, respectively. The region containing the short two-stranded b-sheet (b6, b7) in A. marina PRDX6 is much bulkier than the equivalent region in PRDX2, and this kind of association is not allowed.

disulfide bridge. It is, however, well known that upon oxidation, the N-terminal part of helix a2 that contains the peroxidatic Cys residue is unwound to allow the formation of the bridge. Since the resolving cysteine Cys183 of A. marina PRDX6 is not structurally aligned with the resolving cysteine of typical 2-Cys PRDXs (see Table 1), it thus seemed interesting to see if unfolding the loop helix active site motif in a way similar to what is observed in typical 2-Cys PRDXs would bring the peroxidatic Cys residue close enough to the resolving one and allow the formation of the bridge. For this simulation, we have used as a model the crystal structure of rat HBP23/ PRDX1 (pdb 1qq2), a typical 2-Cys PRDX in which dimers contain two disulfide bonds between the peroxidatic Cys52 residue of one subunit and the resolving residue Cys173 of the other subunit (Hirotsu et al. 1999). Using O (Jones et al. 1991), we have superposed the two residues of HBP23/PRDX1 preceding the unfolding and the two residues following the unfolding on equivalent residues of A. marina PRDX6. More precisely, residues 44, 45 and 57, 58 of one subunit of HBP23/PRDX1 are superposed on residues 37, 38 and 50, 51, respectively, of one subunit of A. marina PRDX6. After this superposition, residues 46­56 of HBP23 are renumbered 39­49, are mutated to the corresponding sequence of A. marina PRDX6, and these residues are used to replace the original equivalent residues in PRDX6. The same operation is performed with the two subunits of one dimer. After this operation and without any modification of the region containing the resolving Cys183, the peroxidatic Cys45 residue comes in the vicinity of the resolving Cys183 residue of the other subunit. This would allow the formation of the disulfide bridge with a minimum of reorganization. Indeed, the structure of this dimer was easily regularized using REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al. 1997) after specification of the two disulfide bridges using the SSBOND command in the PDB file. The result is presented in Figure 3B. In this simulation, the disulfide bridge runs between strands b10 and b11 of the terminal b-sheet. The two strands are thus drawn aside so that b10 no longer belongs to the sheet. This simulation thus confirms that it is quite possible that, upon oxidation, A. marina PRDX6 uses the mechanism of a typical 2-Cys PRDX, as previously suggested (E. Loumaye, A. Andersen, A. Clippe, H. Degand, M. Dubuisson, F. Zal, P. Morsomme, J.F. Rees, and B. Knoops, in prep.). Conclusions We report here the crystal structure of A. marina PRDX6. The sequence of this enzyme is very similar to that of mammalian 1-Cys PRDXs, but there are several additional cysteine residues. We show here that the threedimensional structure also resembles very much that of mammalian 1-Cys PRDX6. A monomer is composed of

two domains and the N-terminal domain is characterized by a thioredoxin fold. Two monomers are associated to form dimers. In spite of these resemblances, it has been shown that from a mechanistic point of view, A. marina PRDX6 behaves as a typical 2-Cys PRDX (E. Loumaye, A. Andersen, A. Clippe, H. Degand, M. Dubuisson, F. Zal, P. Morsomme, J.F. Rees, and B. Knoops, in prep.). On this basis, and taking into account that in the C45S mutant studied here the disulfide bridge between the peroxidatic and the resolving cysteine residues cannot be formed, one would expect the formation of toroidshaped decamers by the association of five dimers. Such toroids do not exist in any of the three crystal forms presented here, but in two forms, pairs of dimers are associated as tetramers. This suggests that A. marina PRDX6 should function more like a peroxidase and thus as a cytoprotective antioxidant enzyme or a modulator of peroxide-dependent cell signaling rather than a molecular chaperone. Indeed, toroid-shaped oligomer formation appeared to be necessary, although not sufficient, for 2-Cys PRDX molecular chaperone activities (Jang et al. 2004; Chuang et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2007). Also, a simulation of the structure of the oxidized form shows that the formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond is quite possible and that Cys183 is very well positioned to act as a resolving cysteine. Materials and Methods Crystallization
The cloning, expression, and purification of C-terminal hexahistidine (63His)-tagged recombinant A. marina PRDX6 and its mutant C45S have been described (E. Loumaye, A. Andersen, A. Clippe, H. Degand, M. Dubuisson, F. Zal, P. Morsomme, J.F. Rees, and B. Knoops, in prep.). The C45S mutation was necessary for the crystallization. Three crystal forms were obtained: two monoclinic forms and an orthorhombic one. The orthorhombic crystal was grown in 0.1 M Bis-tris pH 5.5, 25% (w/v) PEG3350, 0.001 M DTT, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. Ammonium sulfate (0.1 M) was added to those conditions to obtain the two monoclinic forms. The crystallization method was hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 18°C, using a protein concentration of 10 mg mLÀ1. The volume of the crystallization solution was 500 mL, and the crystallization drop was formed by mixing equal amounts (1 mL) of the protein solution and the crystallization solution. Crystals appeared after 2 d for all forms. Crystals of the two monoclinic forms seemed very similar and grew to a size of 0.3 3 0.3 3 0.05 mm3. The size of the orthorhombic one was 0.2 3 0.5 3 0.1 mm3. The crystal of the second monoclinic form was soaked in 1 mM H2O2. The second monoclinic form is not a consequence of the soaking because other crystals, not soaked, have the same unit cell parameters.

Data collection
Before data collection, the crystals were soaked for a few seconds in a cryosolution similar to the mother liquor but

containing 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant, and were flashcooled at 100K. Some statistics of data collection and processing of the three crystals are presented in Table 2.

Data processing, structure solution, and refinement
The diffraction images of the different crystals were processed and merged with the XDS program package (Kabsch 1993). There are eight subunits in the asymmetric unit of the orthorhombic form and four in the one of the two monoclinic forms. The crystal of monoclinic form 1 was used to solve the structure. In this form, a self-rotation function allowed us to identify the presence of five coplanar non-crystallographic twofold axes and another one perpendicular to this plane. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the software PHASER (Storoni et al. 2004) and the superposition of pdb files of different peroxiredoxins as models (pdb entries: 1hd2 [Declercq et al. 2001], 1nm3 [Kim et al. 2003], 1prx [Choi et al. 1998], 1qmv [Schroder et al. 2000], 1qq2 [Hirotsu et al. 1999], 1qxh ¨

Electron density of an average map was interpreted using O (Jones et al. 1991) and COOT (Emsley and Cowtan 2004). After applying the NCS-phased refinement procedure available in the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 1994), the refinement was pursued with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al. 1997). The second monoclinic and the orthorhombic structures were solved using the monoclinic form 1 structure ° as a model. For the second monoclinic form, a rigid body at 4 A resolution was refined using REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al. 1997). After applying the NCS-phased refinement procedure available in the CCP4 suite, only some manual adjustments with COOT (Emsley and Cowtan 2004) were necessary and were followed by refinement using REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al. 1997). The orthorhombic form was solved by molecular replacement using PHASER (Storoni et al. 2004). After applying the NCS-phased refinement procedure available in the CCP4 suite, the refinement was pursued with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al.
