Abstract The L-subunit (E1L) of the pyruvate decarboxylase L (E1, K2 L2 ) component of the Bacillus stearothermophilus pyruvate dehydrogenase complex was comparatively modelled based on the crystal structures of the homologous 2-oxoisovalerate decarboxylase of Pseudomonas putida and Homo sapiens. Based on this homology modelling, alanine-scanning mutagenesis studies revealed that the negatively charged side chain of Glu285 and the hydrophobic side chain of Phe324 are of particular importance in the interaction with the peripheral subunitbinding domain of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase component of the complex. These results help to identify the site of interaction on the E1L subunit and are consistent with thermoL dynamic evidence of a mixture of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions being involved. ß 2003 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction In most organisms, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate is performed by enzymes of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, which consists of pyruvate decarboxylase (E1, EC 1.2.4.1), dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2, EC 2.3.1.12) and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3, EC 1.8.1.4). Multiple copies of the three enzymes are non-covalently, but tightly, assembled into a highly organised multienzyme complex. E1 catalyses both the thiamine diphosphate-dependent decarboxylation of the pyruvate and the subsequent reductive acetylation of a lipoyl group, which is covalently bound to the E2. E2 catalyses the acyl transfer to CoA, and E3 the reoxidation of the resulting dihydrolipoyl moiety with NADþ as the ultimate electron acceptor (for reviews, see [1,2]). E2 forms the structural core of the complex, composed of 24 or 60 E2 polypeptide chains organised with octahedral or

eicosahedral symmetry, respectively, according to the source. The E2 chain has a multi-domain-and-linker structure. In the eicosahedral Bacillus stearothermophilus PDH complex, it consists of one lipoyl domain (LD), a peripheral subunit-binding domain (PSBD), and an acetyltransferase inner core domain (CD), which are connected by long and £exible linker segments rich in proline, alanine and charged amino acids [2,3]. The PSBD, located between the N-terminal LD and C-terminal CD, is remarkably small (only 35 amino acids) and serves to attach both E1 and E3 (mutually exclusively) to the E2 core in this as in other eicosahedral PDH complexes [2,5,6]. Analysis of the E1^E2 subcomplex by means of cryo-electron microscopy reveals the 60 E1 molecules as forming an outer shell î some 90 A above the surface of the eicosahedral inner core of 60 acetyltransferase domains [4]. The E1 component is a heterodimer (K2 L2 ) with molecular masses of V41 kDa and V36 kDa for the K- and L-chains, respectively, and the structure has been solved for the homologous E1 components of the branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (BCDH) complexes of Pseudomonas putida [7] and Homo sapiens [8]. A crystal structure of the B. stearothermophilus E3^PSBD complex has been determined [9], revealing a single PSBD bound very close to the two-fold axis of the E3 dimer, as inferred from the 1:1 stoichiometry [5,6]. No structure of the complex between the PSBD and E1 is available, but biochemical studies have again demonstrated a 1:1 stoichiometry [6] and that the E1L subunits must contain the site of association [6,10,11]. Likewise, it has been suggested that the PSBD-binding site on E1 is located at or close to the two-fold axis of the K2 L2 tetramer [6], where residues in particular from the C-terminal regions of the L-chains are located [7,8]. We show here that a plausible molecular model of the L-subunits in the E1 K2 L2 heterotetramer from the B. stearothermophilus PDH complex can be generated, and that this can then be used to identify amino acid residues whose side chains play an important part in the interaction with the PSBD of the E2 chain. In addition, the results throw light on the protein^protein interaction that underlies the assembly, in line with recent thermodynamic studies of the system [12^14]. 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sequence alignments and homology modelling The amino acid sequence of the E1L chain from the B. stearothermophilus PDH complex (residues 1^324 out of 324) was aligned with the sequences of the E1L chains of the 2-oxoisovalerate decarboxylase

406 of P. putida (residues 3^338 out of 339) and humans (residues 19^342 out of 342). SWISS-MODEL (Automated Protein Modeling Server) was used for this purpose. The three-dimensional structure of the E1L subunit of the B. stearothermophilus E1 was modelled using the program Swiss-PdbViewer (http://www.expasy.ch/spdbv/mainpage.htm) [15] connecting to Swiss Model Automated Protein Modeling Server. Modelling was based on the two crystal structures of the P. putida and human proteins available in the database (Protein Data Bank identi¢cation: 1QS0B and 1DTWB). The structures of the E1L subunits were superimposed and assembled to produce the E1(L2 ) homodimer using the graphical software MidasPlus, in which the CK atoms of residues were used for the superimposition and assembly. 2.2. Gene manipulation and site-directed mutagenesis A sub-gene encoding the E1L subunit in the plasmid pKBstE1b [16] was ampli¢ed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 33 bp forward primer incorporated six mismatches to create an XhoI restriction site at the region corresponding to 1400 bp. Primer sequences used were as follows: 5P-CCCATGCCGAACTCGAGAGTGAAACGCCGTAGC-3P (forward, mismatches underlined) and 5P-GCTACGGCGTTTCACTCTCGAGTTCGGCATGGG-3P (reverse). The resulting 1197 bp DNA fragment was cut with NcoI and ScaI and puri¢ed using a Qiagen Plasmid Mini-Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA) after electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrylamide gel. This fragment was then ligated into NcoI/ScaI-cut, pKBstE1b expression vector. The resulting plasmid pKBstE1b(XhoI) was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain XL1 Blue. The insert DNA was completely sequenced to ensure its accuracy. This plasmid was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis. To create E1L variants, the following primers were used: 5P end primer: 5P-GGAATACACGATTCCGATCGGCAA-3P; 3P end primer: 5P-GCTACGGCGTTTCACTCTCGAGTTCGGCATGGG-3P; E251A: 5P-ATCATCGGTTCGGTCGCAAAAACGGGC-3P, 5P-GCCCGTTTTTGCGACCGAACCGATGAT-3P; K252A: 5P-ATCATCGGTTCGGTCGAAGCAACGGGC-3P, 5P-GCCCGTTGCTTCGACCGAACCGATGAT-3P; R255A: 5P-GAAAAAACGGGCGCCGCCATTGTCGTT-3P, 5P-AACGACAATGGCGGCGCCCGTTTTTTC-3P; E285A: 5P-CATCTTAAGCCTTGCGGCGCCGGTGTTGCG-3P, 5P-CGCAACACCGGCGCCGCAAGGCTTAAGATG-3P; M322A: 5P-GCGAAAAAAGTGGCGAACTTCTAACAGCGGAC-3P, 5P-GTCCGCTGTTAGAAGTTCGCCACTTTTTTCGC-3P; N323A: 5P-GCGAAAAAAGTGATGGCCTTCTAACAGCGGAC-3P, 5P-GTCCGCTGTTAGAAGGCCATCACTTTTTTCGC-3P; F324A: 5P-AGTGATGAACGCCTAACAGCGGACAA-3P, 5P-TTGTCCGCTGTTAGGCGTTCATCA-3P. For the D203A mutant, the restriction sites PstI and XhoI were used for improved cloning e/ciency. 5P end primer: 5P-TGCGCTGCGTATCGAGTTGAAA-3P (for the PstI restriction site); 3P end

Gene expression and protein puri¢cation Cultures of E. coli strain TG1 recO cells transformed with plasmid pKBstE1a or pKBstE1b(XhoI) were grown in LB medium and induced with isopropyl-L-D-thiogalactose, and the recombinant E1(K2 L2 ) protein was puri¢ed as described previously [16]. The purity of the protein was checked by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate^polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Pharmacia PhastSystem1. The mutation in each protein was con¢rmed by means of electrospray mass spectrometry using a Micromass Quattro-LC spectrometer. 2.4. Enzymatic activity of mutant E1 components The enzymatic activity of wild-type and mutant E1 components was determined by measuring the rate of the reduction of the arti¢cial electron acceptor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) in the presence of pyruvate [17]. The decrease in A600 was monitored at a temperature of 30C. 2.5. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection The interaction of the PSBD with the mutant E1 was investigated by using SPR detection [18]. A di-domain (ThDD: a LD linked to its PSBD and with a thrombin cleavage site in the linker region) was puri¢ed and immobilised on the CM5 sensor chip of a Biacore 2000 instrument using the surface thiol method to react with the lipoyl group on the LD, as described elsewhere [13,18]. The immobilisation level of the ThDD was adjusted from 100 to 250 response units to minimise any potential mass transport phenomena. To obtain kinetic parameters, E1 was injected at a £ow rate of 5 Wl/min to interact with the sensor surface for 10 min (association phase) at ¢ve di¡erent concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 200 nM. The £ow was continued for a further 10 min with E1 omitted from the bu¡er to obtain the dissociation phase, all as described elsewhere [13,18]. Experimental data for each mutant were collected from ¢ve runs (sensorgrams).

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Sequence alignment for the B. stearothermophilus E1L chain The complete amino acid sequence of the B. stearothermophilus E1L chain (residues 1^324) was aligned with the sequences of E1L chains from P. putida (residues 4^339) and human (residues 19^342), whose crystal structures have been solved at

î î resolutions of 2.4 A [7] and 2.7 A [8], respectively. As depicted in Fig. 1, the B. stearothermophilus and P. putida chains show 44.7% sequence identity, and the B. stearothermophilus and H. sapiens chains exhibit 45.8% sequence identity. The alignment suggests that the B. stearothermophilus E1L monomer contains 11 K-helices and 14 L-strands.

3.2. Homology modelling of the B. stearothermophilus E1L monomer The eicosahedral PDH complex of B. stearothermophilus and the octahedral BCDH complexes of P. putida and H. sapiens have a heterotetrameric (K2 L2 ) E1 component. To create a homology model for the B. stearothermophilus E1L,

we used the other two proteins as templates. A protein whose sequence has at least 40% identity to a known template structure can be modelled automatically with an accuracy approaching that of a low resolution X-ray structure or a medium resolution nuclear magnetic resonance structure [19,20]. The structure of the E1L monomer was modelled by the program SWISS-MODEL (Fig. 2A) and the dimer was constructed by graphical software MidasPlus (Fig. 2B). The backbone of the model for B. stearothermophilus E1L was closely superimposable on those of the templates, except for the loop regions (Fig. 2A). As in the sequence alignments (Fig. 1), the loop regions of the model structure di¡er from the two crystallographically determined structures at loop 15 (residues 178^195) and loop 19 (residues 237^246). However, these variable regions are highly solvent-exposed and located far from the two-fold axis of the dimer, which is expected to be at or close to the potential binding site for the PSBD of E2. Therefore, these loop regions are unlikely to play a signi¢cant part in the binding. The E1L model structure was further analysed by using the validation software PROCHECK [21] to evaluate its stereochemical quality. A Ramachandran plot (data not shown) exhibited a good distribution for the P/i angles, consistent with a good quality model. For the E1L monomer, 82.5% of (non-Gly and non-Pro) residues were in the most favoured regions, 15.6% in the additionally allowed regions, 1.1% in the generously allowed regions, and only 0.7% in the disallowed regions. 3.3. Identi¢cation of the residues in the E1L subunit involved in binding the PSBD of E2 The positively charged residue Arg135 and the non-polar residue Met131 of the PSBD appear to be prominently involved in binding E1 to the E2 chain of the B. stearothermophilus PDH complex [14]. We therefore searched for negatively charged residues, which might interact with Arg135 and non-polar residues, which might interact with Met131, among the surface residues on the E1L dimer. The binding site for PSBD on E1 is likely to be in the E1L chains in the vicinity of the E1 two-fold axis, where the C-terminal regions of the E1L chain comprise much of the surface [6^8,10,11]. In the light of the structure in Fig. 2, two residues with acidic side chains (Glu251 and Glu285) and one residue with a nonpolar side chain (the C-terminal Phe324) were initially chosen for replacement with alanine. Other surface residues (Asp203, Lys252, Arg255, Met322 and Asn323) in the immediate vicin-

î ity (within 10 A) of the centre of Glu285 were subsequently replaced with alanine to check their involvement (Fig. 2C). The e¡ect of the mutations in E1L on the catalytic activity of the reassembled E1 (K2 L2 ) tetramer was assessed using the DCPIP reduction assay. The speci¢c activities of almost all the mutants were found to be roughly the same, if anything a little higher than that of wild-type E1 (Fig. 3). In order to test the binding a/nity of E1 mutants for the wild-type PSBD, non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out after mixing the PSBD with the reassembled E1 (K2 L2 ) heterotetramer [6,13]. All the E1 mutants retained their normal capacity to bind the PSBD under these conditions (data not shown). Thus, the mutations in the E1L chain appear to be benign in terms of the overall enzymatic activity and the folding and assembly of the E1 tetramer, consistent with the fact that sites of mutation on E1L are located far from the active site of E1 (K2 L2 ). SPR analysis was used to measure equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd ) for the interaction of the mutant E1 (K2 L2 ) tetramers with wild-type PSBD. SPR analysis for E1 mutants E251A, E285A and F324A was performed ¢rst, followed by the other mutants: D203A, K252, R255A, M322A and N323A. For every mutant, wild-type E1 was passed through the £ow cell and used as an internal reference. The kinetic

Kinetic data were determined by means of SPR analysis. The errors are less than þ 5%. All the measurements were performed in HBS bu¡er, pH 7.4 and at 25C, as in Section 2. The kinetic parameters of the interaction of the PSBD with E1 are kon = 3.27U106 M31 s31 , koff = 1.06U1033 s31 , Kd = 3.24U10310 M31 [18]. a vG = 3RTln Kd , where R = 1.987 cal/mol/K and T = 298 K.

parameters were then evaluated as relative ratios (the value for a mutant divided by that for the wild-type) and are listed in Table 1. The E285A and F324A mutations in E1L gave rise to the biggest e¡ects on the binding a/nity. The E1 mutants E285A and F324A dissociated from the wild-type PSBD about ninefold and 13-fold faster, respectively, than wild-type E1. In contrast, the other mutations displayed little e¡ect on the binding a/nity. These results invite the speculation that Glu285 and Phe324 may be involved in the interaction with PSBD and begin to outline the E1L interface in the complex with PSBD. 3.4. Nature of the binding sites for PSBD on E1 and E3 The electrostatic surface potential was calculated by using the computer software GRASP [22] and mapped onto the molecular surfaces of E1, E3 and PSBD (Fig. 4). The electrostatics and surface shape of the regions around the two-fold axes of both E1 and E3 were compared. As shown in Fig. 4, the surface of helix 1 of PSBD is characterised by highly exposed positively charged residues. In the crystal structure of the E3^PSBD complex [9], three of these residues,

Arg135, Arg139 and Arg156, generate an `electrostatic zipper' with the negatively charged side chains of Asp344 and Glu431 from one subunit of the E3 dimer and E3 makes a snug ¢t with this region of the PSBD. The importance of these three positively charged residues in the PSBD, and in particular of Arg135, has been highlighted by mutagenesis studies [13]. In contrast, for E1, three acidic residues, Asp203, Glu251, and Glu285, protrude from the surface and are evenly distributed over the likely binding site for PSBD in the C-terminal region of E1L (Fig. 4). However, only Glu285 appears to be important for the binding to PSBD (Table 1). The presence of the C-terminal residue Phe324, the hydrophobic side chain of which also projects outwards in this region, should be noted. It is conceivable that this side chain interacts with the nonpolar side chain of Met131 of the PSBD, a residue of critical importance in the binding of E1 but not of E3 [14]. A role for the C-terminal carboxyl group cannot be ruled in or out at this stage. The binding of E3 to the PSBD is entropy-driven [12,13], despite the particular importance of electrostatic interactions and the loss of con¢gurational entropy [9]. Conversely, E1 binding to the PSBD is more enthalpy-controlled, re£ecting

a more balanced mixture of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between E1 and PSBD [12,14]. The two di¡erent binding surfaces between E1 and PSBD, and E3 and PSBD (Fig. 4), are characterised by substantially di¡erent thermodynamic parameters but similar kinetics of interaction [12^14]. Two key residues for the E1^PSBD interaction have been identi¢ed in the present study, and a putative binding site on E1 delineated at least in part. A full interpretation of the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction must await the determination of a three-dimensional structure for the E1^ PSBD complex.
