The second generation Hoechst-Bayer non-nucleoside inhibitor, HBY 097 (S-4-isopropoxycarbonyl-6-methoxy-3-(methylthiomethyl)-3,4-dihydroquinoxalin-2(1H)-thione), is an extremely potent inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) and of HIV-1 infection in cell culture. HBY 097 selects for unusual drug-resistance mutations in HIV-1 RT (e.g. Gly190Glu) when compared with other non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs), such as nevirapine, a-APA and TIBO. We have determined the structure of HBY Ê 097 complexed with wild-type HIV-1 RT at 3.1 A resolution. The HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 structure reveals an overall inhibitor geometry and binding mode differing signi®cantly from RT/NNRTI structures reported earlier, in that HBY 097 does not adopt the usual butter¯y-like shape. We have determined the structure of the Tyr188Leu HIV-1 RT drug-resistant mutant Ê in complex with HBY 097 at 3.3 A resolution. HBY 097 binds to the mutant RT in a manner similar to that seen in the wild-type RT/HBY 097 complex, although there are some repositioning and conformational alterations of the inhibitor. Conformational changes of the structural elements forming the inhibitor-binding pocket, including the orientation of some side-chains, are observed. Reduction in the size of the 188 side-chain and repositioning of the Phe227 side-chain increases the volume of the binding cavity in the Tyr188Leu HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex. Loss of important protein-inhibitor interactions may account for the reduced potency of HBY 097 against the Tyr188Leu HIV-1 RT mutant. The loss of binding energy may be partially offset by additional contacts resulting from conformational changes of the inhibitor and nearby amino acid residues. This would suggest that inhibitor ¯exibility can help to minimize drug resistance.

Introduction
Human immunode®ciency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) remains a central target for the development of chemotherapy against HIV infection. Numerous potent, highly speci®c nonnucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase have been described (reviewed by De Clercq, 1994, 1995; Tantillo et al.,
# 1998 Academic Press

314 1994; Arnold et al., 1996; Ding et al., 1997). Various structures of HIV-1 RT complexed with NNRTIs have been determined, including nevirapine (Kohlstaedt et al., 1992; Ren et al., 1995a), a-APA (Ding et al., 1995a; Ren et al., 1995a), TIBO (Ding et al., 1995b; Ren et al., 1995b; Das et al., 1996), HEPT (Ren et al., 1995a) and its derivatives (Hopkins et al., 1996), and BHAP (Esnouf et al., 1997). The crystal structure of the Tyr181Cys HIV-1 RT mutant complexed with 8-Cl-TIBO has also been reported (Das et al., 1996). NNRTIs are a diverse group of compounds with different chemical structures. There are striking similarities in the binding geometry of the inhibitors in the HIV-1 RT/NNRTI complexes (Ding et al., 1995b; Ren et al., 1995a). However, considerable variation in the protein conformation of the inhibitor-binding region has been seen, even for structures of different derivatives within the TIBO and HEPT classes (Das et al., 1996; Hopkins et al., 1996). There has been considerable interest in NNRTIs, because, in general, they are less toxic than the nucleoside analog RT inhibitors (NRTIs), e.g. AZT, ddI, 3TC, etc. However, like NRTIs, NNRTI ef®cacy in monotherapeutic regimens is limited by the rapid emergence of HIV-1 viral variants with reduced drug susceptibility. Extensive research efforts have been devoted to the design and development of improved NNRTIs. In the past several years, treatment of AIDS patients with combinations of NRTIs and HIV-1 protease inhibitors has produced substantial and sustained reduction in plasma HIV-1 RNA (e.g. see Gulick et al., 1997). Due to the considerable toxicity of NRTIs, it is usually not feasible to increase dosage to obtain greater bene®t. Trials have shown that including NNRTIs in drug combinations for treating HIV-1 infection can be very bene®cial, and both nevirapine and delavirdine have been approved for clinical application. Treatment regimens involving combinations of nevirapine/AZT/ ddI (D'Aquila et al., 1996; Montaner et al., 1998), delavirdine/AZT (Demeter et al., 1997) and loviride/AZT/3TC (Staszewski et al., 1996) have demonstrated signi®cant reductions in HIV-1 viral load. The Hoechst-Bayer inhibitor, HBY 097 ((S)-4-isopropoxycarbonyl-6-methoxy-3-methylthiomethyl3,4-dihydroquinoxalin-2(1H)-thione) (Figure 1), a second-generation NNRTI, has been selected for clinical trials. HBY 097 is extremely potent in inhibiting HIV-1 replication in vitro, with an IC50 value of 6 nM for the HIV-1 MN strain (Kleim et al., 1995). Furthermore, HBY 097 has an unusual drug resistance pro®le in vitro compared with other NNRTIs, e.g. nevirapine, a-APA and TIBO. HIV-1 variants containing the Gly190 3 Glu mutation in HIV-1 RT can be selected in cell culture by HBY 097 and other quinoxaline derivatives (Kleim et al., 1995). The mutation at position 190 reduces the polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT to about 10% that of wild-type HIV-1 RT, suggesting that this mutation might cause a reduction in viral replication rate. When HIV-1 replicates in cell culture

under continuous challenge with HBY 097, mutations ordinarily associated with NRTI resistance (Leu74 3 Val/Ile and Val75 3 Leu/Ile) are selected as secondary mutations following the selection of the Gly190 3 Glu mutation (Kleim et al., 1996). These secondary mutations have been shown to restore much of the polymerase activity (Boyer et al., 1998). HBY 097 was the ®rst antiviral agent reported to select for both NNRTI and NRTI mutations. We have proposed a possible mechanism by which the NNRTI and NRTI resistance mutation sites ``communicate'' through the template-primer, situated in the DNA-binding cleft bridging the two sites (Kleim et al., 1996; Boyer et al., 1998). We have determined the structures of wild-type and Tyr188Leu HIV-1 RT in complexes with HBY 097. The mode of binding of HBY 097 to HIV-1 RT deviates substantially from the ``butter¯y-like'' arrangement seen for numerous other NNRTIs in complex with HIV-1 RT. This may account for some of the unusual drug-resistance characteristics of HBY 097. The Tyr188 3 Leu mutation in HIV-1 RT confers high-level resistance to a number of NNRTIs, including DMP 266, a-APA and 9-ClTIBO both in vivo and in vitro (Schinazi et al., 1997 and references therein). HBY 097 is more effective against the Tyr188Leu HIV-1 RT mutant (see Table 1; IC50 600 nM, or 14-fold resistance relative to IC50 45 nM for wild-type HIV-1 RT) than many other NNRTIs, e.g. nevirapine and delavirdine (with IC50 values of 2.86 mM and > 100 mM, respectively). Comparison of the structures of the wildtype/HBY 097 and Tyr188Leu HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complexes suggests that resistance may result from loss of contacts between the inhibitor and the aromatic ring of Tyr188. This loss of binding may be partially offset by additional contacts resulting from subtle rearrangements of the inhibitor and nearby amino acid residues, suggesting that inhibitor ¯exibility can help to minimize drug resistance.

Results and Discussion
Structure of the wild-type HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex The overall structure of HIV-1 RT in the HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex is similar to that in other HIV-1 RT/NNRTI complexes. As reported previously (Nanni et al., 1993; Rodgers et al., 1995; Hsiou et al., 1996), the region corresponding to

the non-nucleoside inhibitor-binding pocket (NNIBP) is closed in the absence of a bound NNRTI. The NNIBP is primarily located between the b6-b10-b9 and b12-b13-b14 sheets and includes the b5-b6 loop (Pro95, Leu100, Lys101 and Lys103), b6 (Val106 and Val108), the b9-b10 hairpin (Val179, Tyr181, Tyr188 and Gly190), the

b12-b13 hairpin (Phe227, Trp229, Leu234 and Pro236), and part of b15 (Tyr318). HBY 097 is bound in this hydrophobic pocket (Figure 2(a)). There are two potential hydrogen-bonding interactions between HBY 097 and the main-chain Ê atoms of Lys101 (N2-O (Lys101)  2.8 A, and Ê ). The methylthiomethylene S1-N (Lys101)  3.7 A

317 RT/NNRTI structures. The methylthiomethylene group occupies the tail position of the butter¯y in a manner similar to that of the carboxamide moiety of a-APA in complex with HIV-1 RT (Ding et al., 1995a; Ren et al., 1995a), making hydrophobic interactions with Val179, Tyr188, Val189 and Gly190 main-chain atoms. Structure of the Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex The Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT is 15 to 25 times more resistant to inhibition by HBY 097 than is wild-type HIV-1 RT (Kleim et al., 1995). However, HBY 097 is still a relatively potent inhibitor (IC50600 nM; Table 1). The overall structure of the Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex is similar to the wild-type HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 strucÊ ture with an RMS deviation of 0.55 A, based on superposition of all the Ca atoms, and there was no major main-chain movement in the mutant structure (Figure 2(b)). The clear electron density for the side-chain of Leu188 in the p51 subunit (see Figure 4(b)) indicates that the Leu188 side-chain is oriented similarly to the Tyr188 side-chain in the wild-type HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 structure (w1  À72 in the wild-type and w1  À59 in Tyr188Leu). However, there is no clear electron density for the side-chain of Leu188 in the p66 subunit. Calculations assuming ideal rotamers (w1  À60 or w1  180 ) show that adoption of either conformation would result Ê Ê in short contacts (distances of 2.6 A and 2.2 A, respectively) with the isopropoxycarbonyl group of HBY 097. With adjustments of the w2 angle, the rotamer with w1  À60 can be ®tted into the NNIBP without signi®cant steric hindrance and the side-chain of Leu188 could adopt a range of conformations around the ideal rotamer, contributing to the ¯exibility of the NNIBP region. A similar situation has been reported for the structure of Tyr181Cys mutant HIV-1 RT/8-Cl-TIBO complex (Das et al., 1996), where Cys181 was ordered in the p51 subunit and disordered in the p66 subunit. The HBY 097 inhibitor geometry and binding mode differs in the wild-type and the Tyr188Leu HIV-1 RT complexes Superposition of the complexes of HBY 097 with wild-type HIV-1 RT and with the Tyr188Leu mutant (Figure 2(b)), based on the p66 palm sub-

Ê group of HBY 097 is proximal (<3.5 A) to residues Tyr188, Val179 and Gly190. The isopropoxycarbonyl group of HBY 097 is near the phenyl ring of Phe227 and the Ne1 atom of Trp229. Also, the methoxy group and part of the quinoxaline ring are near Leu100. The overall binding mode of HBY 097 differs from the commonly seen butterfly-like geometry In other reported HIV-1 RT/NNRTI complexes, the bound inhibitor assumes a butter¯y-like shape (Ding et al., 1995b; Ren et al., 1995a), with the exception of the recently reported HIV-1 RT/ BHAP complex (Esnouf et al., 1997). To simplify comparisons with other HIV-1 RT/NNRTI structures, we describe HBY 097 binding in terms of the butter¯y analogy. The major feature distinguishing HBY 097 from other HIV-1 RT/NNRTI structures is the overall binding geometry. The center of the HBY 097 molecule cannot bend to conform to the V-shaped ``body'' of the butter¯y. Instead, the quinoxaline ring system constraints cause it to form a ¯atter structure connecting the ``wing I'' and ``wing II'' positions (Figure 2(c)). This causes extensive contacts between Leu100 and the inhibitor (Figure 1(a)) not usually seen with inhibitors that assume the butter¯y-like shape. The tip of the isopropoxycarbonyl group occupies the wing I position and interacts with Leu100, Tyr181, Tyr188 and Trp229. Instead of the aromatic interactions seen in HIV-1 RT/a-APA and HIV-1 RT/nevirapine structures, protein-inhibitor interactions in the wing I region are mainly hydrophobic contacts, involving atoms of the saturated isopropoxycarbonyl group. This type of protein-ligand interaction is similar to that observed in HIV-1 RT/TIBO complexes (Ding et al., 1995b; Ren et al., 1995b; Das et al., 1996). Flexibility in the wing I position may account for the substantial potency that HBY 097 shows against the commonly observed Tyr181 and/or Tyr188 drug-resistant mutants. Relative to the butter¯y-like analog, the aromatic region of the quinoxaline group occupies the top of the wing II position and, together with the methoxy group, has extensive hydrophobic interactions with Leu100, Tyr318 and Phe227, in addition to having two potential hydrogen bonds with Lys101 mainchain atoms (Figures 1(a) and 2(a)). The angle between the wing I and wing II moieties (102 ) is comparable to those reported in the other HIV-1

318 domain highlights the differences in the drug-binding mode. Some adjustments are observed in the torsion angles within both the isopropoxycarbonyl and the methylthiomethylene groups. In general, HBY 097 binds to the mutant HIV-1 RT in a manner similar to that seen in the wild-type HIV-1 RT/ HBY 097 complex. The hydrogen bond between the carbonyl O atom of Lys101 and the N2 atom of HBY 097 is present in both complexes, but is shortÊ Ê er (3.2 A versus 3.7 A) in the mutant complex (Figure 1(b)). The interactions between Tyr318 and HBY 097 are similar in the two structures (Figure 1(b)). HBY 097 exhibits greater ¯exibility than many other NNRTIs. Both wing I (isopropoxycarbonyl group) and the body (methylthiomethylene group) of HBY 097 can move, permitting it to accommodate to different amino acid residues at positions 181 and 188. In the Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 structure, the interplanar angle between wing I (the isopropoxycarbonyl group) and wing II (the aromatic group of the quinoxaline ring) moieties is 5 smaller than that observed in the wild-type HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 structure (Figure 2(b)). The contacts between HBY 097 and Leu100 are dramatically reduced in the mutant HIV-1 RT structure. However, the methoxy group of HBY 097 switches its contacts from Phe227 to Leu234 and His235. Some of the interactions that were lost between the mutant HIV-1 RT and HBY 097 may be compensated for by the enhanced interaction between the S1 atom of HBY 097 and the main-chain amide nitrogen atom of Lys101 Ê (S1 ±N  3.2 A). Differences in the NNIBP region between the wild-type and mutant RT/HBY 097 complexes Comparison of the wild-type and Tyr188Leu HIV-1 RT complexes with HBY 097 reveals a number of conformational changes in the side-

Tyr188Leu Mutant and Wild-type RT/HBY Complexes

chains in the NNIBP region and some more subtle changes in the main-chain conformation. Perhaps the most striking change involves the repositioning of the Phe227 side-chain occupying a position in the mutant structure that would cause sterically unfavorable interactions with the Tyr188 side-chain in the wild-type structure. Calculations of the NNIBP cavity volume, for both the wild-type and Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT/ Ê HBY 097 complexes, using a 1.4 A probe radius, indicates that there is a signi®cant increase in the NNIBP volume in the Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 Ê RT/HBY 097 complex (with volumes of 106 A3 Ê and 162 A3 for wild-type and Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT, respectively). This assumes that Leu188 adopts a rotameric conformation similar to that of Tyr188 in the wild-type HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 structure. The expansion in volume is mainly due to the change in the side-chain orientation of Phe227 and the mutation at position 188. A similar expansion in the NNIBP volume has been reported for the Tyr181Cys HIV-1 RT/8-Cl-TIBO structure (Das et al., 1996). Although no major main-chain shift has been detected within the NNIBP region, there is a slight expansion in the middle of the NNIBP (around residues 100, 179 and 234) in the Tyr188Leu RT/HBY 097 complex, corresponding to the change in inhibitor geometry (angle between the wing I and wing II planes) and repositioning of the quinoxaline ring system (Figure 2(c)). In conjunction with these changes, the Ca position of Met184 in the mutant HIV-1 Ê RT/HBY 097 complex has shifted by 1.0 A (Figure 3) and the Ca position of Gly231 has Ê shifted by 0.8 A in the mutant HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 structure. These two residues are located in the polymerase active site and the primer grip, respectively. Apparently, the conformations of residues located at the polymerase active site are sensitive to changes in the NNIBP.

Drug resistance mechanisms: conformational changes of protein and inhibitor may partially compensate for loss of interactions with Tyr188 in the Tyr188Leu complex The observation that the NNIBP regions and drug-binding modes are similar in both the wildtype and mutant HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex structures suggests that the inhibitor interacts similarly with both HIV-1 RTs. Therefore, loss of drugenzyme interaction could account for the reduced potency in HBY 097 against the Tyr188Leu mutant

HIV-1 RT. In both the Tyr181Cys (Das et al., 1996) and Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT/NNRTI structures, the side-chains of the mutated residues in the p66 subunit are disordered. In the wild-type RT complex, the aromatic side-chain of Tyr188 has extensive van der Waals interactions with the inhibitor, particularly with the isopropoxyl moiety. These interactions are lost in the Tyr188Leu mutant complex. However, a number of adjustments in the conformations of both the inhibitor and the binding pocket may partially compensate for the loss of these interactions.

320 Flexibility in the torsion angles of both the isopropoxycarbonyl and the methylthiomethylene groups permits the HBY 097 molecule to adapt its conformation to accommodate changes in proteininhibitor interactions. This conformational ¯exibility may partially explain why HBY 097 retains good potency against a number of HIV-1 RT mutations that can confer high-level resistance to other NNRTIs (Kleim et al., 1995). Such conformational ¯exibility may prove to be the key factor in the development of drugs with improved potency against a broad spectrum of drug-resistant mutants. Thus, it will be important to explore the possibility of introducing greater structural ¯exibility in HBY 097, and in other NNRTIs as well. However, increased inhibitor ¯exibility is expected to be accompanied by higher entropy, with variable potential bene®t for different classes of inhibitors. Mechanism of drug-resistance for the Gly190Glu mutation A useful feature of HBY 097 as a potential candidate for AIDS treatment is that it is relatively effective against many common NNRTI-resistant variants. In cell culture, HBY 097 selects HIV-1 RT drug-resistance mutations that are relatively unusual e.g. Gly190Glu and Gly190Gln. In complexes of both wild-type and Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT with HBY 097, the C14 methyl group is located near the main-chain atoms of Gly190. Furthermore, there are extensive van der Waals interactions between residue 100 in the p66 subunit and the piperazine ring in the structure of the wild-type HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex. This is consistent with in vitro resistance studies (Kleim et al., 1997) of HIV-1 with HBY 097 showing that mutations at position 100 and 190 are frequently observed under low and high selective pressure, respectively. It appears that subtle changes in the way NNRTIs bind to HIV-1 RT and the protein conformations can lead to substantially different drugresistance mutation spectra. The mutation from glycine to glutamic acid or glutamine at position 190 has been selected as a resistance mutation in HIV-1 RT only with HBY 097 and a BHAP derivative (Fan et al., 1996). We have modeled a glutamate residue in place of Gly190 in the wild-type HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex structure. Any of the preferred rotamers for the glutamate would introduce substantial steric bulk and a hydrophilic, potentially charged sidechain, into the binding pocket. The NNIBP region in the mutant RT would not be able to accommodate an NNRTI. This suggests that the Gly190Glu HIV-1 mutant might be resistant to virtually all NNRTIs, consistent with prior observations (Kleim et al., 1994). When we model the Glu190 mutation into the unliganded HIV-1 structure (Hsiou et al., 1996), two out of the three preferred rotamers have short contacts with the side-chain of Tyr188. The

Tyr188Leu Mutant and Wild-type RT/HBY Complexes

third favorable rotamer of the Glu190 causes short contacts with the main-chain atoms of Lys103 and Ser105 in the b5-b6 loop, suggesting that conformational changes in the NNIBP region might be required to accommodate either Glu or Gln at position 190. The reduced polymerase activity in the Glu190 mutant HIV-1 RT is consistent with the idea that the Glu190 mutation would lead to distortions of the NNIBP region, which is closely connected with the polymerase active site. Secondary mutations (Leu74 3 Leu/Ile and Val75 3 Leu/Ile) have been observed to restore HIV-1 replication rate and polymerase activity (Kleim et al., 1996; Boyer et al., 1998). These secondary mutations may compensate for changes in the polymerase active-site region caused by the Gly190Glu mutation.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization and data collection Both wild-type HIV-1 RT and the Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT used in crystallization were prepared as described (Clark et al., 1995). The NNRTI HBY 097 and a brominated analog (S-0483) were co-crystallized with HIV-1 RT. Inhibitor-containing solution (20 mM of inhibitor in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and 20% (w/v) n-octyl b-D-glucopyranoside) was mixed with thawed HIV-1 RT concentrate (40 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 75 mM NaCl) in a 2:1 inhibitor to enzyme molar ratio. The hanging drops were prepared by adding equal volumes of the protein/inhibitor and crystallization (50 mM bis-Tris Á propane (pH 6.8), 100 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (w/v) PEG 8000) solutions. Crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique at 4 C. Crystals grew to an average size of 0.1 mm Â 0.3 mm Â 0.7 mm after four days. Two diffraction datasets for the wild-type HIV-1 RT/ HBY 097 complex were collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) F1 beam line Ê (l  0.91 A). One dataset was merged from images collected from 15 crystals at À10 C (cooled); the other was collected from one crystal at À165 C (frozen) and recorded on a 1 K Â 1 K CCD detector (Table 2). The diffraction dataset for the Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex was collected at the CHESS F1 beam line from one crystal at À165 C (Table 2). Diffraction data were processed with DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996). Final data were scaled using the program SCALA in the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). For the wildtype HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex datasets, the overall Ê Rmerge factors are 17.4% to 3.3 A resolution with a completeness of 84.6% for the cooled dataset, and Ê 7.0% to 3.1 A resolution with a completeness of 95.8% for the frozen dataset, respectively. Structure determination and re®nement of the wild-type HIV-1 RT/ HBY 097 complex reported here is based on the dataset for the frozen crystal, owing to its higher quality. The crystals had the symmetry of space group C2 Ê Ê with cell dimensions of a  227.1 A, b  70.0 A, Ê c  106.7 A and b  105.3 for the cooled crystal dataÊ Ê Ê set and a  225.2 A, b  69.4 A, c  104.6 A and b  106.4 for the frozen crystal dataset.

minated HBY 097 derivative (S-0483) was collected at À165 C on an R-axis II image plate detector and was scaled to the native dataset using FHSCAL in the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). For the dataset of the Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT/HBY complex, the overall Rmerge value is 9.8% to Ê 3.3 A resolution with a completeness of 97.9%. The Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex also crystallized with the symmetry of space group C2 Ê Ê and cell parameters of a  224.8 A, b  69.3 A, Ê c  105.3 A and b  105.8 . The diffraction data statistics are summarized in Table 2. Structure determination The wild-type HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex structures, obtained from frozen and cooled crystal datasets, were solved using the molecular replacement method with HIV-1 RT coordinates of the HIV-1 RT/9-Cl TIBO complex as a starting model (Das et al., 1996). Rigid body re®nement after molecular replacement gave a free R-factor of 36.7% and an R-factor of 35.6%. The relatively small difference between the free and conventional R-factors at this stage is due partly to the close relationship between the RT/HBY 097 and RT/9-Cl TIBO crystal cells. In the ensuing stages of re®nement, the free R-factor reached a value as high as 41% before model improvement, which led to an eventual value of 33.6%. The atomic model of HBY 097 was obtained from a small-molecule crystal structure provided by Dr E. F. Paulus at Hoechst. Omit maps were calculated using datasets from both frozen and cooled crystals, and the omit maps for both frozen and cooled datasets were averaged to improve map quality and reduce model bias

(using both the program RAVE and the multiple crystal averaging package, DMMULTI). Rounds of model building were guided using both normal and averaged omit maps. The HBY 097 orientation was interpreted on the basis of a difference Fourier (Fobs À Fcalc) map (Figure 4(a)), and further con®rmed by locating the bromine position of the brominated HBY 097 derivative in the difference Fourier map calculated using the differences between the brominated derivative (S-0483) and the native datasets as amplitudes. Structure re®nement was performed using both the conventional and torsionrestrained re®nement protocols in XPLOR (Brunger, 1993). Detailed crystallographic data and re®nement statistics are listed in Table 2. The ®nal model of HIV-1 RT contains 556 amino acid residues and 4342 non-hydrogen atoms in p66, and 430 amino acid residues and 3439 non-hydrogen atoms in p51. Some residues have very weak electron density and are apparently disordered. These residues have been modeled as alanine, including residues 24, 26-27, 63-64, 67, 70-72, 91, 138-139, 218-221, 233, 248, 277, 284, 286287, 289, 292-293, 297, 301, 323, 328, 334, 336, 347, 356, 366, 411, 424, 447, 529, 542, 546, 550 and 556 in the p66 subunit; and residues 66, 70, 121, 174, 221-222, 229-230, 237, 241-242, 249-250, 267, 278, 281, 283-284, 288, 291, 299, 305, 310, 312, 323, 357-358, 361, 422 and 427-428 in the p51 subunit in the wild-type HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex. The ®nal RMS deviations of bond distances Ê and angles for the model reported are 0.01 A and 1.8 , respectively. The HIV-1 Tyr188Leu mutant/HBY 097 complex structure was solved using the molecular replacement method with the coordinates of HIV-1 RT of the wildtype HIV-1 RT/HBY 097 complex as the starting model.

The difference Fourier map shows clear electron density for the bound inhibitor (Figure 4(b)). There is no clear electron density for the Leu188 side-chain in the p66 subunit. However, density for the Leu188 side-chain is evident in the p51 subunit (Figure 4(c)). This suggests that the side-chain of Leu188 is disordered in p66. Analogous behavior of the Cys181 residue has been reported for the Tyr181Cys mutant HIV-1 RT/8-Cl-TIBO structure (Das et al., 1996). Residues 24, 26-27, 63-64, 66-67, 70, 91, 138139, 188, 219-220, 222, 224, 233, 277, 284, 286-287, 289, 292-293, 297, 301, 311, 323, 328, 334, 336, 347, 356, 366, 411, 424, 447, 529, 549-550 and 556-558 of p66, and residues 13, 66, 70, 121, 174, 220-222, 229-230, 237, 248-250, 278, 281, 283-284, 305, 310, 312, 323, 357, 361, 422 and 427-428 of p51 are modeled as alanine due to weak electron density. Final re®nement statistics are listed in Table 1. Accession codes Coordinates for HBY 097 complexed with wild-type and Tyr188Leu mutant HIV-1 RT have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (entry code 1bqm and 1bqn, respectively) for immediate release.
