The crystal structure of the neutral protease from Bacillus cereus has been refined to an R factor of 17.5% at 0.2-nm resolution. The enzyme, an extracellular metalloendopeptidase, consists of two domains and binds one zinc and four calcium ions. The structure is very similar to that of thermolysin, with which the enzyme shares 73% amino-acid sequence identity. The active-site cleft between the two domains is wider in neutral protease than in thermolysin. This suggests the presence of a flexible hinge region between the two domains, which may assist enzyme action. The high-resolution analysis allows detailed examination of possible causes for the difference in thermostability between neutral protease and thermolysin.

Neutral protease from Baciflus cereus (NP) is a metalloprotease which hydrolyses polypeptide chains at the imino side of hydrophobic and aromatic residues (Feder et al., 1971; Sidler et al., 1986a). The amino acid sequence, comprising 317 residues, was determined by protein sequencing (Sidler et al., 1986b). In addition to the active-site zinc ion, the enzyme binds four calcium ions which appear to have a stabilizing effect on its overall three-dimensional structure, perhaps accounting in part for the moderate thermostability of the protein (Pauptit et al., 1988). After a 20-min incubation at 60°C, 90% of the original activity of NP is retained (Sidler et al., 1986a). Thermolysin (TLN), the neutral protease from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus, shows 73% amino acid sequence identity to NP (Sidler et al., 1986b), but is about 20°C more thermostable. Single amino acid substitutions in the neutral protease of B. stearothermophilus have demonstrated that minor changes in the structure can influence the thermostability substantially (Imanaka et al., 1986; Takagi and Imanaka, 1989). Recently, Vriend et al. (1991) reported a stability-increasing Ala + Ser mutation in neutral protease of B. stearothermophilus, which displaced an internal water molecule. The three-dimensional structure of NP was solved at 0.3-nm resolution by molecular replacement methods, using TLN as a trial model (Pauptit et al., 1988). A number of possible reasons for the difference in the thermostabilities of NP and TLN have been discussed previously (Pauptit et al., 1988). However, the 0.3-nm model was not sufficiently accurate to examine, for example, differences in hydrogen bonding that might contribute to the difference in

thermostability. Recently, 0.2-nm resolution synchrotron data have been collected and used to continue the refinement of NP. This allows a better comparison with TLN, for which a 0.16-nm resolution structure exists (Holmes and Matthews, 1982).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization Neutral protease from Bacillus cereus (strain: DSM 3101) was a kind gift from Prof. H. Zuber and Dr. W. Sidler, who reported its isolation, purification, characterization and sequencing (Sidler et al., 1986a, b). The crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapour diffusion method following the procedure described by Pauptit et al. (1988). In order to minimize autodegradation of the native protease, the crystallization experiments were carried out at 0°C (on ice in a cold room). This resulted in a shower of small crystals of the expected hexagonal bipyramidal morphology, which after 1 2 days changed into dense clusters of filamentous crystals (an unsuitable crystal form that persisted as long as the experiments were kept on ice). Several days after transferring the hanging-drop crystallization trays from ice to a drawer in the cold room (8"C), a small number of hexagonal bipyramidal crystals with dimensions up to 0.1 mm appeared in each drop. This was found to be a reproducible strategy for obtaining crystals of adequate size. Temperature-dependent difference in stability of alternative crystal forms is not often exploited in protein crystallization. The crystals have space group P6522 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 7.65 nm, c = 20.1 nm, CI = /? = 90.0", y = 120.0". , Data collection and processing Data to 0.2 nm were collected at the EMBL X11 beam line at DESY, Hamburg, using X-radiation of 0.1488-nm

Refinement During the first 38 refinement cycles, the resolution was increased stepwise from 0.3 nm to 0.25 nm, 0.22 nm and finally 0.2 nm after the refinement cycles 2,9 and 29, respectively. During the first rebuild after cycle 38, 193 water molecules were included in the model at peaks in a difference electron density map (Fo-Fc). After continued positional refinement and refinement of individual temperature factors, an R factor of 18.8% was reached after cycle 99, but the geometry of the structure needed improvement. Restraining the geometry heavily, and carrying out several interactive adjustments of the model on the computer graphics display system, allowed the same R factor to be obtained after cycle 188 with reasonable geometry. Further minor corrections to the model were applied and residues with high temperature factors were reexamined. This led to an R factor of 19.0% after cycle 255. An additional 19 cycles, including a bulk solvent correction, lowered the R factor to its final value of 17.5% at 0.2-nm resolution. Water molecules with temperature factors larger than 0.7 nm2 were omitted from the model, resulting in a total of 304 solvent sites.

wavelength. Orienting the c-axis parallel to the rotation axis involved placing the capillary at awkwardly large angles (45") to the goniometer axis, because of the bipyramidal morphology. The crystal - film distance was 56 mm. Oscillation photographs of 1" were collected over a range of 30". The radiation sensitivity and small size of the crystals prohibited collecting more then 4- 5" of data/crystdl, and many crystals were needed to complete the data set. Each film pack contained two Kodak DEF5 films, which were developed and digitized using an Optronix Photoscan System P-1000 with a raster size of 50 pm and an optical density range of 3.0. The diffraction data were processed using the MOSFLM film processing package (Leslie et al., 1986). Refinement The 0.3-nm model of Pauptit et al. (1988) was taken as starting model in least-squares refinement, using the TNT program package (release 3E; Tronrud et al., 1987). The refinement, in four resolution steps, was interrupted at several stages to examine and rebuild the structure using version E4.4 (by P. R. Evans) of the FRODO software (Jones, 1978) operating on an Evans and Sutherland PS-330 colour graphics system hosted by a VAX-8830 computer. The electron density maps for use with the rebuilds were calculated with oa(Read, 1986), 2F,-Fc, F and F,-F, coefficients. Bulk solvent correc, tions were carried out using programs from the CCP4 (1979) program collection [SERC (UK) Collaborative Computing Project no. 4; Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington WA4 4AD, UK] in connection with the TNT programs. The partial structure factors, calculated using the program SFC for the protein and for the bulk solvent (determined with the program WATERMAP) were scaled and combined with the program ICOEFL. Occupancies were not refined. Structural superpositions were carried out using the program LSQKAB.
RESULTS Data processing

Model quality From the variation of the R factor with resolution (Luzzati, 1952), the mean coordinate error of the final model was estimated to lie between 20-25 pm (Fig. 1). The final model conforms to accepted stereochemistry with standard deviations from ideal bond distances and angles of 1.1 pm and 2.5", respectively (see Table 2). A backbone dihedral angle plot (Ramachandran et al., 1963) for NP is presented in Fig. 2. A number of residues have unfdvourable conformations: Serl53 and Asnl60 are located at either end of the loop that connects two a-helices (H3 and H4, see Table 3) near the center of the molecule. These two adjacent a-helices form a rigid base for the active site. Ser93 escapes the hydrophobic interior of the protein by forming hydrogen bonds to surface residues, forcing the torsion angles to unfavourable values (as observed previously in TLN). Asnl84 and Thrl95 have distorted backbone conformations, perhaps because they are calcium ligands. All the unfavourable backbone conformations found in NP are also observed for the equivalent residues in TLN (Matthews et al., 1974). There is one cis-peptide bond, between Leu51 and Pro52, just as in TLN. Fig. 3 shows the average temperature factor of the main and side-chain atoms for each residue. High average temperature factors along the main chain correspond to loop regions, whereas high average values for side-chain atoms correspond to solvent-exposed side chains.

Of the data measured and processed, the best 28 film packs from 9 different crystals were merged to give a data set which

Fig. 1. Luzzati plot. Theoretical variation of the R factor with resolution, without (0)and with (a) solvent correction (see text), as bulk a function of the mean positional error in pm (Luzzati, 1952). The overall R factors are 19.0% and 17.5%, respectively. The resolution scale runs from 1.O nm (2sin$/i = 1.o nm- ') to 0.2 nm (2sinO/i = 5 nm-I). The effect of the bulk solvent correction is visible even at 0.2-nm resolution. This appears to be a consequence of the improved scaling between observed and calculated data. The mean coordinate error estimated from this plot lies clearly below 25 pm. After completion of the refinement we received an update of the program package TNT (release 4a), which contains an improved RFACTOR module. The R-factor calculation was repeated and is shown with (0) and without ( A ) bulk solvent correction. The overall R factors decreased to 17.8% and 17.4%, respectively, indicating that additional bulk solvent correction is no longer necessary with the new TNT release.

Overall structure description

The overall folding of the molecule is depicted in Fig. 4. The elements of secondary structure present in NP are listed

in Table 3. The turns are classified according to Richardson (1981). The N-terminal domain (residues 1 - 137) consists mainly of @-structure (Fig. 5), a small 310-helix (Hl) and a single a-helix (H2). The @-structure is composed of a fivestranded sheet close to the active site and a distorted /I-structure stabilized by a calcium ion (Ca3), with five short strands further away from the active site, one of which continues into a strand in the first sheet (Fig. 5). The C-terminal domain (residues 138- 317) is predominantly a-helical. Two adjacent a-helices (H3, H4) anchor the active-site Zn ion. The core of the C-terminal domain is dominated by five a-helices (H4, H8, H9, H10, H l l ) , whose relative positions and orientations agree well with the hexadecahedral packing model proposed by Murzin and Finkelstein (1988). There are also two pairs of short antiparallel P-strands. A particularly long loop (residues 180-237) contains a lefthanded a-helical turn (H6) as well as two small 310-helices (H5, H7). This loop contains all but one of the ligands for the calcium sites Cal, Ca2 and Ca4. The y-turn in TLN is the site of the only insertion in the NP sequence with respect to TLN (Gly26). In NP, this turn (residues 25 - 28) is a @-turn.

Fig.4. Overall fold. Stereo cartoon of the neutral protease folding produced by the program RIBBON (Priestle, 1988). The N-terminal domain consists mainly of pleated sheet structure and contains only one sc-helix while the C-terminal domain is mainly a-helical. The Ca and Zn ions have been indicated by black dots. Helices have been labeled sequentially (see Table 3). For clarity of the stereo plot, the labels have not been superimposed onto the figure. The short lines are pointing in the direction of the helices.

Metal ion sites The active-site zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated to His143 and His147 on a-helix H2 from the N-terminal domain, a water molecule and Glu167 on a-helix H3 from the C-terminal domain which is coordinated through both carboxylate oxygen atoms. The catalytic Glu144 forms a hydrogen bond with the water molecule that is liganded to the zinc ion. The calcium ions have either six ligands in a distorted octahedral (Ca2) or seven in an irregular pentagonal bipyramiv

dal coordination (Cal, Ca3 and Ca4). This agrees well with the values reported in a review on calcium binding in proteins by McPhalen et al. (1991). They found that the number of coordinating ligands ranges between five and eight, although most of the calcium ions have six or seven ligands. Cal and Ca3 each have one ligand whose carboxylate group coordinates with both oxygen atoms in a bidentate fashion. For Ca4, one ligand (Thrl95) coordinates with both its main-chain carbonyl and its side-chain hydroxyl group. Ion - ligand distances are given in Table 4. The values agree well with TLN (Holmes and Matthews, 1982) and (for the Zn ion) with other zinc enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase I1 (Eriksson et al., 1988) and carboxypeptidase A (Rees et al., 1983). The liganding residues in the double calcium site Cal, Ca2 (Table 4) are all in the loop 178-191, except for Asp139 which is located at the N-terminus of a-helix H3. Asp192 was proposed as a possible Ca2 ligand in the 0.3-nm model, but is 0.4 nm away from Ca2 in the high-resolution analysis. The two calcium ions in the double calcium site are 0.39 nm apart, identical to the situation in TLN within experimental error (Table 5). Ca3 binds in a loop to residues 58, 60 and 62. Ca4 is located near the double calcium site and has as ligands residues 194, 195, 198 and 201. All calcium-carboxylate distances found are in the range of 0.22 - 0.275 nm reported by Einspahr and Bugg (1981). The metal - metal distances (Table 5) agree well with equivalent values in TLN, except for Ca3 Zn which deviates significantly. Since Ca3 is the only metal ion binding to the N-terminal domain, this deviation is consistent with the active-site cleft being wider in NP than in TLN. Since Cal, Ca2 and Ca4 are located relatively close to the putative hinge region, the distances between them and Ca3 would not be greatly affected by a domain movement. If the separate Nterminal domain of NP is overlayed onto TLN, the position of Ca3 corresponds closely to that of Ca3 in TLN. The binding sites of Cal, Ca2, Ca3 and Zn in NP superimpose well onto those in TLN. The Ca4-binding loop in NP (residues 194- 201) has a different conformation from that in TLN (Fig. 6) and also shows the highest main-chain tempera-

Crystal contacts

The crystal packing of NP is such that each molecule is in contact with five neighbours through a total of 16 direct hydrogen bonds (Fig. 7) as well as numerous water-mediated contacts. No salt bridges between neighbouring molecules were found. There are 31 residues that make intermolecular contacts closer than 0.35 nm.

Superimposing the entire structure of NP onto TLN yields a root mean square (rms) deviation between equivalent Ca atoms of 0.086 nm. Superimposing the N-terminal (residues 1- 137) and the C-terminal domains (residues 139- 316) independently gives much lower rms deviations (0.062 nm and 0.043 nm, respectively). This indicates a difference in the relative position of the two domains in NP and TLN. The activesite cleft at the domain interface of NP is wider than that in TLN. The differences in N P and TLN Ca coordinates after superposition are plotted in Fig. 6. The first large deviation occurs at residue 26, where TLN has the y-turn and N P has an insertion, creating a p-turn. The second peak (Fig. 6) occurs at the Ala38 (NP) 4 Asp (TLN) substitution, where the side chain is oriented towards the interior in NP and faces solvent in TLN. The spikes at residues 47, 83 and 298 also correlate with differences in amino acid sequence. The broad peak between residues 190- 200 reflects the flexible loop region which binds Ca4. Residues 220 - 240 are shifted with respect to the TLN structure, probably due to the crystal contacts, which in NP are such that this loop cannot move closer to the active site, while in TLN they prevent the loop moving further away from the active site.

DISCUSSION
Domain flexibility

ture factors (Fig. 3). Thus, flexibility of this loop is likely. The positive ionic charges of Cal, Ca2 and Ca3 are adequately compensated by negatively charged residues. Ca4 retains one net positive charge, since it has only one negatively charged ligand (Asp201).

The fact that the active site cleft in NP is wider than that in TLN suggests that the domains are connected by a flexible hinge at residues Gly136-Glyl37. This area is reasonably well conserved in the Bacillus neutral protease sequences shown in Fig. 8. Thayer et al. (1991) proposed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase a hinge in the corresponding

787
residues. The observed differences in backbone conformation between NP and TLN at the two glycine residues are: Gly136 A q , A y , = 12.3",-14.4" andGly137 A q , A y , = 11.0',5.2°. Rms deviations for the q,y angles between NP and TLN of 5.67" and 8.48", respectively, have been calculated. The differences in the q,y, angles of these two glycines are small and hardly significant. Nevertheless these small changes are sufficient to account for the proposed domain movement. It is difficult to establish whether the exact conformational state determines or is determined by crystal packing, but nonetheless it seems likely that there is some flexibility in solution. Presumably this would facilitate entry of the substrate into the active site, aiding catalytic efficiency. Complexes of TLN with several different inhibitors have been reported (Holmes and Matthews, 1981; Monzingo and Matthews, 1984; Holden et al., 1987; Roderick et al., 1989) which all share the conformation of the native structure (Holmes and Matthews, 1982). However, careful examination of the native structure has revealed the presence of an oligopeptide in the active-site cleft (D. R. Holland, D. E. Tronrud, H. W. Pley, K. M. Flaherty, W. Stark, J. N. Jansonius, D. B. McKay and B. W. Matthews; unpublished work), so perhaps no truly uninhibited TLN structure is known. NP and TLN have each been studied in only one conformation. However, P . aeruginosa elastase, another neutral protease with significant similarity to NP and TLN, has been studied crystallographically in different conformations (Thayer et al., 1991). A comparative investigation is underway by the three laboratories which solved the neutral protease structures (D. R. Holland, D. E. Tronrud, H. W. Pley, K. M. Flaherty, W. Stark, J. N. Jansonius, D. B. McKay and B. W. Matthews; unpublished work). If the difference in conformation between NP and TLN is due to domain flexibility, it should be possible to model NP in the TLN conformation. Superimposing the two domains of NP independently onto the corresponding ones of TLN results in only a few steric clashes, most of which can be relieved by minor side-chain adjustments. There is some conformational stress in one p-strand (residues 113- 117) which is relieved in TLN by a displacement of the strand away from the active site. The remaining short contact occurs between Met121 and Glu144. In TLN, this is relieved by a (x3)rotation of 120' around the Cy-S bond in Metl2l. The high flexibility of the x3 angle of methionine has been reported in a survey on crystal structures (Janin et al., 1978). A x3 rotation in methionine involves low energy barriers (Gellman, 1991). The conformation of Metl21, which is located immediately behind the active-site cleft, is apparently affected by the opening and closing of the active-site cleft. Since Glu144 is active in proteolysis and is so close to Metl21, it might be interesting to study the necessity of Met121 for activity of the protease, as part of the hinge-bending mechanism or otherwise. We propose a hinge-bending mechanism involving a cluster of six aromatic residues which appear to serve as a ball and socket joint (Fig. 9). Three residues from the N-terminal domain (Tyr84, Tyr85, Phe89) at the C-terminus of helix H2 form the ball, which fits into a socket formed by three residues from the C-terminal domain (Phe173, Tyrl80, Tyr269). Sequence comparison among zinc-endopeptidases shows that the residues at the corresponding positions consistently have aromatic or large hydrophobic side chains (Fig. 8) for the part of the ball and that the socket residues are partially conserved. The residues 173 and 180 are part of helix H4. Missing anchor residues might partially be replaced by residues at position 176. Fig. 10 shows the catalytic site. The geometrical arrangement of the active-site residues is essentially identical to TLN, with the above-mentioned exception that the active-site cleft is more open. The catalytic His232 which is a member of the catalytic triad (Christianson and Alexander, 1990) can approach the zinc ion through additional conformational flexibility, since glycine-rich areas occur at both ends of the helix containing His232. The enzymatic mechanism is assumed to be the same as that reported for TLN (Monzingo and Matthews, 1984; Hangauer et al., 1984). According to sequence alignment (Fig. S), the active site and the large hydrophobic specificity pocket S1' (Fig. 11) appear to be well conserved among prokaryotic neutral proteases. Furthermore this appears to be true also for enkephalinases (Roques, 1992; Vijayaraghavan et al., 1990). Fig. 12 shows a stretch of 100 amino acid residues of human enkephalinase aligned to NP. Seven of the 28 conserved residues are among those that are fully conserved in the 14 neutral protease sequences shown in Fig. 8. This is not surprising, since enkephalinases exhibit similar specificity as neutral proteases (Pozsgay et al., 1986).
Thermostability

NP is about 20°C less thermostable than TLN (Sidler et al., 1986b). A number of features affecting the thermal stability of proteins have been described in recent years (for a review see Alber, 1989). The 0.3-nm model of NP has been compared to TLN previously in an attempt to rationalize the difference in thermostability (Pauptit et al., 1988). Differences in calcium binding, salt bridges and hydrogen bonding were considered possible factors affecting the thermostability of the enzyme. It is now possible to compare the two enzymes more accurately, using the 0.2-nm structure of NP presented here. The importance of the calcium-binding sites for the stability of proteins has been demonstrated, for example for TLN (Dahlquist et al., 1976; Fontana, 1988) and for T4 lysozyme (Kuroki et al., 1989). Removing the calcium ions with EDTA renders TLN susceptible to autodigestion, especially at high temperatures. Toma et al. (1991) have demonstrated that by replacing residues 188 - 194 in neutral protease of B. subtilis by residues 192-201 of TLN in order to create the Ca4 binding site in the neutral protease of B. subtilis, the half-life at 62°C of this newly engineered enzyme is approximately doubled. Changes in the calcium binding sites therefore can apparently influence the stability of the protein. The binding site of Ca4 in NP exhibits high temperature factors, indicating a flexible loop region (residues 194-202). The site has one net positive charge, which does not guarantee the strongest possible Ca binding. However, this is also the case for TLN and neutral protease from B. stearothermophilus. Neutralization of the remaining positive charge, for example by a Thr195 +Asp mutant, might result in enhanced thermostability. There are indeed more hydrogen bonds in TLN than in NP, as predicted by Pauptit et al. (1988). Using a cutoff of 0.35 nm, 39 hydrogen bonds are found in TLN that do not occur in NP, while only 27 are found in NP that are absent in TLN. Thus, there are 12 extra intramolecular hydrogen bonds in TLN (4% of all hydrogen bonds). Each hydrogen bond contributes 2.1 - 6.3 kJ/mol to the free energy of stabilization (Fersht et al., 1985). Thus, the stability gained from extra hydrogen bonds is more than sufficient to account for the 20 "C difference in thermostability. The refined structure of NP also allows re-examination of the salt bridges. Previously, it was argued that the salt bridge

which stabilizes the position of the carboxyl-terminal helix in TLN is absent in NP, with implications for folding and stability, but that this is more than compensated by an interdomain salt bridge which exists in N P but not in TLN (Pauptit et al., 1988). In the refined structure, the interdomain salt bridge turns out to be weak. This, and the fact that this salt bridge is solvent-exposed, increases the relevance of the missing salt bridge in the carboxyl-terminal helix of NP. With this exception, the salt bridge situation is much as described by Pauptit et al. (1988). A revised list of salt bridges in NP and TLN is presented in Table 6. The stabilizing effect of rigid proline residues on protein structure can be particularly strong in p-turns (up to AT, =

1.2 K ; Suzuki, 1989) and at the N-terminus of a-helices (up to AT, = 3.0 K, AAG = 1.2 kJ/mol; Pakula and Sauer, 1989; AT, = 2.1 K, AAG = 3.3 kJ/mol; Matthews et al., 1987). The stabilizing effects do not only depend on the amino acid but also on the local environment and vary considerably from case to case. The preceding numbers should therefore be considered as a guide only. The proline residues 52, 185, 196, 209 and 215 are identical in the two structures and not relevant to the difference in thermostability. Pro100 in NP (Ala in TLN) is located in a loop region, perhaps providing some local stabilization. TLN, however, has three proline residues (70, 133, 278) which are absent in NP. Pro70 is located at the Nterminus of an a-helix. Mutagenesis studies on the neutral

Fig. 12. Relation of enkephalinase to neutral protease. The alignment of a segment of NP and human enkephalinase (HS.ENKE; EMBL accession code = X07166) shows 28% sequence identity (#). This segment of NP contains three pleated sheet strands from the N-terminal domain (residues labeled B). The second fi-strdnd indicated is at the edge of the pleated sheet and lines the active site (see Fig. 5). The third P-strand is antiparallel to the second one. Thus the insertion of two residues in the enkephalinase sequence falls into the turn region between these strands. The loop between the third P-strand and the flexible hinge (+) in NP is mostly at the surface and can easily accommodate a few extra residues. Of the residues immediately surrounding the zinc ion (*) His143, His147 and Glu144 are conserved, while zinc ligand Glu167 is replaced by Asp in the enkephalinase sequence. The residues Phel31, Leu134 and Val140 lining the S1' specificity pocket (S) and residues Phe173 and Tyrl80 from the joint region (A) also appear to be conserved.

protease of B. steurothermophilus have shown that the enzyme having a proline instead of an alanine residue in the position equivalent to Aka70 in NP is considerably more thermostable (Eijsink, 1991). Pro133 and Pro278 are both located in a-turns. These proline exchanges could account for about a quarter of the increased stability of TLN. Again, an exact estimation of the free energy difference is difficult, since it is environment-dependent . Imanaka et al. (1986) and Takagi and Imanaka (1989) reported that a single mutation in neutral protease from B. stearotherrnophilus (Gly144 Ala) increases the thermostability and decreases the activity of the enzyme. The replacement of a glycine by an alanine at the equivalent position in NP is possible since there is a cavity in the protein packing. This cavity occurs close to the hinge region (see above). Therefore, filling it might restrict the flexibility of the protease, which could explain the decrease in the activity. Variations in the thermostability by optimizing the packing in the interior of proteins have been investigated in neutral protease of B. Jtenmtl~rrmophilus(Vriend et al., 1991), bacteriophage fl
--$

(Sandberg and Terwilliger, 1989) and also in the A-repressor (Hecht et al., 1986). Eijsink et al. (1991) recently carried out therinostabiiity studies on the neutral protease of B. subfilis. This work indicated that local unfolding of surface loops of one molecule, followed by proteolytic cleavage through another, may sometimes be the main factor determining the thermostability of neutral proteases, since nicked molecules will be quickly proteolysed further. Possibly, therefore, an exchange of one or two critical residues in the most labile surface loops might in such situations be sufficient to explain the difference in thermal stability between two (neutral) proteases. Thus, a number of possible explanations can be found for the decreased thermal stability of NP with respect to TLN. It remains difficult to assess the relative contributions of each effect. Overall, the structural differences between NP and TLN described would account for the observed differences in thermostability. The coordinates of the refined 0.2-nm structure of NP have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Brookhaven code 1NPC; Bernstein et al., 1977).
