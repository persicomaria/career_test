The crystal structure of a complex between the catalytic a subunit of Zea mays CK2 and a 23-mer peptide corresponding the C-terminal sequence 181±203 of the human CK2 regulatory b subunit has been determined at Ê 3.16-A resolution. The complex, composed of two a chains and two peptides, presents a molecular twofold axis, with each peptide interacting with both a chains. In the derived model of the holoenzyme, the regulatory subunits are positioned on the opposite side with respect to the opening of the catalytic sites, that remain accessible to substrates and cosubstrates. The b subunit can influence the catalytic activity both directly and by promoting the formation of the a2 dimer, in which each a chain interacts with the active site of the other. Furthermore, the two active sites are so close in space that they can simultaneously bind and phosphorylate two phosphoacceptor residues of the same substrate. Keywords: CK2; phosphorylation; protein kinase; crystal structure; holoenzyme.

The acronym CK2 (derived from casein kinase-2) denotes an essential, ubiquitous and highly pleiotropic member of the protein kinase family with as many as 200 protein substrates known to date, many of which are implicated in signal transduction, gene expression and cell regulation [1±3]. Besides unmatched pleiotropicity, unique features of CK2 are also its ability to recognize residues specified by multiple acidic side-chains (the one at position n 1 3 being of crucial importance), its usage of GTP, besides ATP, as phosphate donor, and its high basal activity, which is independent of either second messengers or previous phosphorylation. This intrinsic activity, quite unusual among protein kinases, is thought to underlie both the oncogenic potential of CK2 (which is invariably elevated in tumors [4] and causative of lymphomas in transgenic mice [5,6]) and its exploitation as phosphorylating agent by pathogens, such as viruses and parasites [4]. High basal activity looks especially intriguing, considering that CK2 is generally isolated as a holoenzyme composed by two catalytic subunits (a and/or a H ) and two regulatory b subunits, tightly assembled to give heterotetramers that do not dissociate except under severe conditions. Both the isolated catalytic subunits, however, and the holoenzyme display intrinsic activity toward specific peptide substrates. The structural basis for the inherent activity of the isolated a subunit has been disclosed by

the crystal structure of Zea mays a subunit (70% identical to the human molecule), showing extensive contacts between the N-terminal segment and the activation loop which is locked into an active conformation [7]. The role of the b subunit, on the other side, remains quite enigmatic: mutational studies have shown that this subunit plays multiple and in some respects opposite functions, by exerting, for example, both a stimulation and a down-regulation of the catalytic activity [8,9]. In particular, the structural elements responsible for up-regulation, as well as for tight physical contacts with the catalytic subunits, mainly reside in the C-terminal domain, which is lacking in the truncated b subunit whose dimeric crystal structure has been recently solved [10]. Consequently, while these truncated b subunits still dimerize but fail to give stable interactions with the a subunit [11], synthetic peptides variably reproducing the C-terminal region of the b subunit both associate with and stimulate the catalytic activity of the a subunit [12,13]. Here we show that a synthetic peptide comprising residues 181±203 of the b subunit, which is able to stimulate the catalytic activity of human CK2a, associates with two a subunits giving rise to a heterotetrameric complex, whose crystal structure discloses some of the basic features of CK2 holoenzyme.

Protein expression and peptide synthesis The catalytic a subunit of Z. mays CK2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified according to a procedure previously described [14]. The b peptide, corresponding to the C-terminal sequence 181±203 of the human CK2 regulatory b subunit, acetylated at the N-terminus, was obtained by standard solid-phase peptide synthesis techniques and purified through reverse phase chromatography.

Phosphorylation assay CK2 activity was monitored using [32P]ATP as phosphate donor and the calmodulin derived peptide 68±92 FLTMMARKMKDTDSEEEIREAFRVF) [15] as phosphoacceptor substrate. The phosphorylation assay was performed as in [15], except for the addition of 100 mm NaCl in the incubation medium. The reaction was stopped after 20 min and the radioactivity incorporated into the peptide was evaluated after SDS/PAGE by direct scanning on Instant Imager Apparatus (Camberra Packard). Surface plasmon resonance analysis The interaction of b[181±203]peptide with CK2a and the interaction of CK2a with itself were analysed with a Biacore X system, where CK2a was covalently linked to a Sensor Chip CM5 (BIAcore). CK2a immobilization was performed as previously described [16]. A surface density of 920 RU (resonance units) was generated. Injections of 35 mL of b[181±203]peptide (100 mm) and 30 mL a protein (133 nm) were performed with a flow rate of 10 and 20 mL´min21, respectively, in running buffer NaCl/Hepes (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% v/v surfactant P20) at 25 8C. Surface was regenerated by injection of 10 mm NaOH (10 mL, flow rate of 10 mL´min21). The surface plasmon resonance response is expressed as resonance units (RU). Each sensorgram (time course of the signal) was subtracted from the response obtained from the surface devoid of immobilized protein (blank surface) and normalized to a baseline of 0 RU. Crystallization and data collection The complex between CK2a and the b[181±203]peptide was prepared by incubating the protein solution with a threefold molar excess of the b peptide for 1 h. Single crystals were obtained by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion technique, using the method described for crystallization of the a subunit [14], including the presence of ATP and Mg21. Single crystals grew in few days at 19 8C and were found to belong to space group Ê Ê Ê P212121, with a  87.7 A, b  119.8 A and c  145.6 A. This corresponds to a crystal volume per unit of protein molecular Ê mass, VM, of 2.45 A3´Da21 and a solvent content of 49%, assuming the presence of two tetrameric molecules (a2peptide2) in the asymmetric unit. Due to the very small size of the crystals, a native data set, measured at the X-ray diffraction beam-line of the ELETTRA synchrotron facility in Trieste Ê (Italy), diffracted only at 3.16-A resolution. A wavelength Ê of 1 A was used, with a crystal to detector distance of 400 mm. One crystal, frozen at 100 K with a cryoprotectant consisting of crystallization solution and 3% glycerol, was enough for a complete data set. Statistics on data collection are summarized in Table 1. Structure determination and refinement The crystal structure was solved by the molecular replacement method with the software amore [17], using the structure of the CK2-a subunit as a template [7]. The crystallographic refinement was carried out with cns [18], imposing restraints on the noncrystallographic symmetry of all subunits and peptides. Three-hundred and thirty solvent molecules were introduced in the final stages of the refinement. From the beginning of the refinement, empty electron densities were present in the active sites of the two tetramers. We could fill

these electron densities with Mg21 ions and four molecules of AMP, one in each active site. The AMP could derive from the partial hydrolysis of the original ATP molecule; in fact, before data collection, the crystals were kept for several weeks at 19 8C. The position of the AMP is very similar to that recently published by Niefind et al. [19] for ATP, with N1 and N6 atoms of the pirymidine base H-bonded to the Glu114-O and Val116-N atoms. The final model presents an overall R factor of 21.4 (Rfree  28.9) and a satisfactory stereochemistry (Table 1): for 11 936 Ê protein atoms, the rmsd is 0.029 A on bond distances and 2.68 on bond angles; 97.5% of the residues lie in the favored regions and only 1.9% in the generous allowed regions; only Glu268 of the catalytic subunit and b-His193 of the regulatory one lie on a disallowed region, but their electron densities are quite clear and their conformations can be explained by the fact that both belong to close turns in a very constrained areas. A cis peptide bond was found for Pro231. Coordinates Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession number 1DS5).

CK2-a activity toward peptide substrates is generally stimulated by the b subunit upon formation of the heterotetrameric holoenzyme. Such a stimulation for a peptide substrate that includes the main phosphoacceptor site of calmodulin (residues 69±92) is shown in Fig. 1a [8]. In contrast, a truncated form of the b subunit lacking its C-terminal domain inhibits, rather than stimulates, the phosphorylation of the peptide. Significant stimulation of activity is observed also by adding to CK2-a a peptide reproducing the 181±203 sequence of the C-terminal domain of the b subunit. This stimulation, albeit reduced in comparison to that of the full length b subunit, is consistent with the concept that this C-terminal region makes important contacts with the catalytic subunits [9,23]. The occurrence of strong interactions between CK2-a and the b[181±203]peptide was also confirmed by plasmon resonance experiments (Fig. 1b). These data prompted us to try to cocrystallyze the Z. mays catalytic subunit together with the b[181±203]peptide. Crystals of the complex could be grown in few days. Despite the use of conditions similar to those previously reported

Fig. 1. The b[181±203]peptide stimulates the activity of and interacts with maize CK2a. In (A), CK2 activity, tested as described in Experimental procedures using the peptide CaM69-92 as phosphorylable substrate, is shown. Concentrations of the kinase and the effectors were as follows: CK2a (a): 0.2 mm, human CK2b wild-type (b), human CK2bD170±215 (bD), and b181±203 (bpep): 0.4 mm. In (B), the sensograms obtained with a BIAcore X system revealing the interaction of either the b[181± 203]peptide (upper panel) or CK2a (lower panel) with CK2a covalently linked to a sensor surface are shown. Details are given in Experimental procedures. The large difference in molecular mass between the b peptide (23 residues) and full size CK2a accounts for the different RU (resonance units) scale of the two sensograms.

for the crystallization of CK2-a alone [14], the crystal form is different: crystals are orthorhombic, space group P212121, with two tetramers in the asymmetric unit (here and in below we shall use the term `tetramer' to indicate the complex formed by two a subunits and two b peptides). In the tetramer, a twofold axis relates the two halves of the molecule (Fig. 2). The conformation of the a chain is very similar to that found for the a catalytic subunit alone: their superposition results in a rmsd on corresponding Ca atoms of Ê about 0.55 A. Not all the 23 amino acids of each peptide are clearly visible in the electron density; the N-terminal portion is disordered, possibly due to the lack of the remaining part of the b chain, and only amino acids from 188 to 203 could be unambiguously fitted in the electron density map (Fig. 3). For one peptide, due

to the different crystal environment, amino acids 186 and 187 could also be located, but they lack any specific interaction with the a subunits. The peptide presents an extended conformation at the C-terminus from Ala196 to Ala203, while it reverses its direction forming a close b turn at the level of Ile192-His193Pro194-Met195. Owing to the molecular symmetry of the tetramer, all interchain contacts are repeated twice; the two tetramers in the asymmetric unit are practically identical. For this reason, we shall describe in details the independent interactions of only one peptide (thereafter called b peptide) with two chains (A and B) of one tetramer. Each b peptide interacts with both aA and aB chains, starting from b-Lys191 to b-Gln200. The total surface area of interaction of residues 191±200 of the b peptide with chains Ê Ê aA and aB is 495 A2 and 265 A2, respectively; this represents 55% of the total surface of this region of the peptide. Two apolar residues of the peptide, b-Ile192 and b-Met195, are buried in a large hydrophobic pocket formed by the dimeric structure, composed of residues Tyr-A39, Val-A41, Phe-A54, Ile-A67, Ile-A69, Val-A101 and Ile-A112 of chain aA and ValB123 and Pro-B126 of chain aB (Table 2). Moreover, several specific polar interactions are present, involving the b peptide residues b-191, b-193, b-194, b-196, b-198 and b-200. This gives rise to at least eight hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions, six with chain aA and two with chain aB; none of these interactions is mediated by solvent molecules. Particularly relevant is the situation presented by b-His193, whose N:2 is hydrogen-bonded to O:1 of Glu-A52 of the catalytic subunit. The latter also participates in a network of direct electrostatic interactions between the two a chains involving Lys-A44 and Arg-A47 of one chain and Asp-B120, Lys-B122 and His-B160 of the other, so contributing to the overall stability of the tetramer (Fig. 4). Arg47 and Glu52 are known to be part of the phosphate anchor region [7]. According to our picture, Arg47 could play a crucial role in the regulation of CK2 activity as it points toward the ATP binding site of the second a chain, being able to interact directly with the nucleotide in the other molecule (Fig. 4). On the contrary, in the monomeric form of the a subunit the side-chain of Arg47 is exposed to the solvent and does not interact with the cosubstrate in the active site. The position of Arg-A47 can be also influenced by the nearby HisB160 of the other a chain, which is part of the catalytic loop. As a consequence, the regulatory subunit can influence the catalytic activity of the a subunit through direct interactions that connect b-His193 to the Arg47 of the catalytic site. Even if the a subunits of the complex are those from Z. mays, it is noteworthy that all residues involved in the main interactions are also conserved in the human protein, supporting the reliability of this complex as model for the human CK2 holoenzyme. In the tetramer, the contacts from residue A41 to A47 and from A52 to A54 with residues from B120 to B123 and that of Arg-A47 with His-B160 are direct interactions between the two a subunits, i.e. not mediated by the b peptide. This result is not inconsistent with literature data, supporting the monomeric nature of isolated a, as these direct interactions between the Ê two a chains involve a limited surface (about 400 A2), probably not sufficient to induce stable dimerization alone. The presence of b peptides (or, in the native holoenzyme, of fullsize b chains) is a necessary condition for the formation of a stable tetramer. Nevertheless, direct interactions between the two catalytic subunits strengthen the complex and possibly influence the catalytic activity, as mentioned above. Pertinent to this is also the observation that although the a subunits normally behave as monomers in solution, they do interact with

Arg-A47 points toward the nucleotide bound in the active site of CK2-a-B and vice versa. Interactions involving Lys-A44, Arg-A47, Glu-A52, Asp-B120, Lys-B122 and His-B160 of the two a chains and His-F193 of a b peptide (see text) are emphasized by dashed black lines.

As previously mentioned, in the crystal structure of the b dimer recently solved [10], the b chains are truncated at residue 182, whereas the b peptide used in our structure starts at position 181. These two complementary structures can be easily combined together without any evident spatial or sterical hindrances to give rise to a plausible hypothetical model of the full size holoenzyme: a twofold axis relates the two ab chains, with the two active sites fully accessible from the opposite side with respect to the one where the regulatory subunits are located (Fig. 5). It is reasonable to assume that the full size b dimer will make additional contacts with the two a subunits in the natural holotetramer, besides the ones involving the 181±203 segment, as suggested by previous studies [20,21]. These intersubunit contacts are likely to account for the residual ability to associate with a of a truncated mutant of the b subunit (bD181±215) [9] and even of the stellate protein sharing similarity with CK2 b but ending at residue 172 [22]. Anyhow, the latter associates with CK2a less tightly than the full size b. Moreover, a synthetic peptide encompassing the whole C-terminal domain of CK2b (155±215) interacts with CK2a

more strongly than its shortened derivative 170±215, as judged from far Western blot analysis [13]. Individually considered, the structure of each a chain inside the complex is not significantly changed as compared to the isolated subunits, with the exception of those side-chains which are directly implicated in intersubunit interaction and of some loops (e.g. the region between 265 and 269), which are not expected to influence catalytic activity. This is quite consistent with the idea that CK2 catalytic subunits are constitutively active both in their monomeric and heterotetrameric forms. However, the overall structure of the complex suggests that oligomerization per se may modulate catalytic activity in a subtle manner, because each catalytic chain interacts with the active site of the other. In addition, the ab interchain contacts are likely to stabilize the catalytic subunit in its active conformation, consistent with the observation that activity, which is reduced upon mutating the N-terminal segment of CK2a, can be restored by the b subunit and its C-terminal peptides [23]. It should be noted however, that as a consequence of tetramerization, the two active sites are quite close each other: in our model the distance between the two nucleotides is about Ê 13 A, but it could be even less, considering that we were able to locate only the AMP portion of the nucleotide (see Experimental procedures). A simple inspection of the model suggests that two substrate protein molecules cannot bind simultaneously, due to the proximity of the two sites. This implies that the occupancy of one site prevents the accessibility to the other by a second substrate molecule. In contrast, such a vicinity of the active sites allows the concurrent phosphorylation of two

The model shown is based on the structure of the complex between two a subunits (in the lower part) with two C-terminal b[181± 203]peptides (in magenta, in the center of the entire complex) presented in this work and the structure of the truncated [1±182]b-dimer (upper part) determined by Chantalat et al. [10]. The model was assembled in such a way to minimize the distances between the C-terminal ends of the b-dimer and the N-terminal ends of the b peptides. The location of a the nucleotides binding site is indicated by red atoms of residues Arg47 and Lys122.

Two protein chains of one tetramer (light gray), two of the other (dark gray) and the four peptides (thicker black lines) give rise to an octameric structure that displays 222 symmetry. One of the twofold axes is on the plane of the paper, the other two form an angle of about 458 with it. The oligomerization blocks the access to all the active sites.

consecutive phosphoacceptor residues positioned in the same Ê substrate at the correct distance, i.e. around 10±15 A apart. Indeed, quite a number of CK2 targets are likely to fulfil this condition as they undergo phosphorylation at two residues which are either adjacent (e.g. inhibitor 2, HMG-1, Myb, etc.), or separated by just one residue (e.g. calmodulin, c-Myc, DARPP32, N-Myc, VSV protein, etc.) [24]. This latter is also the case of the calmodulin derived peptide substrate used to assay CK2 activity in the experiments of Fig. 1a; the phosphorylation takes place at two residues very close to each other (Thr79 and Ser81) and both fulfilling the consensus sequence of CK2 for having a glutamic acid at position n 1 3 (¼(T79)D(S81)EEE¼.). Pertinent to this may also be the observation that these two residues of calmodulin are phosphorylated to approximately the same extent either in vitro [15] or in vivo [25], although serine is generally phosphorylated by CK2 much more readily that threonine [24]. It is finally worth noting that two independent tetramers (AB and CD) are present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal form presented here. They are related by a twofold axis, giving rise to an octameric entity possessing a 222 symmetry (Fig. 6). The main interactions between tetramers involve Glu-A27 with ArgD262 and residues of regions from A72 to A76 with residues from D262 to D267. In particular, there are clear electrostatic interactions between Lys-A74, Lys-A75 and Lys-A76, on one side, and Glu-D264 and Asp-D266 on the other. With the exception of Arg262, all the other residues involved in these supratetrameric interactions are conserved in the human sequence. The residues 74±76 are part of the lysine-rich cluster at the beginning of the aC helix, which plays a critical role in substrate recognition as well as in down-regulation by the b subunit. While it is possible that these interactions are artefacts due to the high concentration of the protein during crystallization, we cannot either rule out the possibility that they can have a biological significance: in fact, this aggregation would hamper the binding of the substrate to the active site, providing a mechanism by which phosphotransferase activity could be reduced under special circumstances. Interestingly, the formation of filamentous forms of CK2, generated by multimerization of several tetramers under physiological conditions, possibly resulting in inhibition of enzyme activity, has been described in an early report on Drosophila CK2 [26].
