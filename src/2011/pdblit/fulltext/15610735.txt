In addition to CAR and PXR, RXR also serves as an obligate heterodimeric partner for about fifteen other nuclear receptors including receptors for retinoic acid (RAR), thyroid hormone (TR), vitamin D (VDR), and fatty acids (PPARs). Crystal structures of the PPAR /RXR and RAR /RXR heterodimers reveal a common mode of dimerization, wherein the N-terminal halves of helix H10 from both receptors form a coiledcoil structure through a sequence motif of  K K X R (where  is a hydrophobic residue, and X is any residue) (Bourguet et al., 2000; Gampe et al., 2000). The K motifs are found in all receptors that heterodimerize with RXR and, thus, provide a molecular basis for RXR heterodimerization among nuclear receptors (Gampe et al., 2000). Although CAR and PXR bind to several of the same chemicals, they have different ligand binding and activation properties (Moore et al., 2000b; Wei et al., 2002; Xie et al., 2000). PXR interacts with a broad spectrum of compounds ranging from steroid metabolites to the macrolides rifampicin and taxol (Kliewer et al., 1998; Synold et al., 2001). The PXR crystal structure reveals that PXR contains a large, elliptically-shaped pocket ° with a volume of 1200 A3, which is well suited to bind promiscuously to different xenobiotics (Watkins et al., 2001). Nearly all of the chemicals that bind to PXR function as agonists (Moore et al., 2000b; Tzameli et al., 2000). CAR is also activated by a diverse set of chemicals including the barbiturate phenobarbital, the antiemetic chlorpromazine, the anti-inflammatory drug acetaminophen (Zhang et al., 2002), the insecticide contaminant TCPOBOP (Moore et al., 2000b; Tzameli et al., 2000), and the heme metabolite bilirubin (Huang et al. 2003). However, most CAR activators do not appear to bind directly to the receptor; instead, they activate CAR by promoting its translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (Honkakoski et al., 1998; Sueyoshi et al., 1999). Notably, both CAR and PXR display marked species differences in their ligand binding profiles. For example, 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) and androstanol bind efficiently to mouse CAR, but not to human CAR (Moore et al., 2000b; Tzameli et al., 2000). The structural basis for CAR ligand selectivity and species differences remains to be established. Like other nuclear receptors, CAR transcriptional activity is mediated by the recruitment of coactivators or corepressors. Crystal structures of several dozen nuclear receptor LBDs have revealed a general mechanism that underscores the importance of the C-terminal activation helix (AF2) in the binding of coregulatory proteins (Li et al., 2003). Both coactivators and corepressors contain short peptide motifs (LXXLL for coactivators versus LXXXIXXXL for corepressors) that interact with nuclear receptors (Heery et al., 1997; Hu and Lazar, 1999; Nagy et al., 1999; Perissi et al., 1999). Coactivator LXXLL motifs adopt a two-turn -helix that docks into the charge clamp pocket formed in part by the AF2 helix when it is in the active conformation (Darimont et al., 1998; Nolte et al., 1998; Shiau et al., 1998). In contrast, the corepressor LXXXIXXXL motif adopts a three-turn helix that

Summary Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) induces xenobiotic, bilirubin, and thyroid hormone metabolism as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Unlike ligand-dependent nuclear receptors, CAR is constitutively active. Here, we report the heterodimeric structure of the CAR and RXR ligand binding domains (LBDs), which reveals an unusually large dimerization interface and a small CAR ligand binding pocket. Constitutive CAR activity appears to be mediated by the compact nature of the CAR LBD that displays several unique features including a shortened AF2 helix and helix H10, which are linked by a two-turn helix that normally adopts an extended loop in other receptors, and an extended helix H2 that stabilizes the canonical LBD fold by packing tightly against helix H3. These structural observations provide a molecular framework for understanding the atypical transcriptional activation properties of CAR. Introduction Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) and pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2) comprise a subfamily of nuclear receptors that serve as key regulators of the body's response to xenobiotic and endobiotic stress (Honkakoski et al., 2003; Kliewer et al., 1998; Sonoda et al., 2003; Wei et al., 2000; Willson and Kliewer, 2002). Activation of either CAR or PXR induces expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes and other proteins involved in the metabolism and active excretion of xenobiotics, which in some instances, can cause dangerous drugdrug interactions (Moore et al., 2000a; Zhang et al., 2002). CAR also regulates thyroid hormone and bilirubin metabolism and is, thus, an exciting therapeutic target for the treatment of diseases including obesity and neonatal jaundice (Huang et al., 2003; Maglich et al., 2004). CAR and PXR share a highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) and a moderately conserved ligand binding domain (LBD). Both receptors bind to DNA as a heterodimeric complex with the retinoid X receptors (RXR), which binds to the vitamin A metabolite 9-cis*Correspondence: eric.xu@vai.org

docks into the same site as the coactivators (Xu et al., 2002). The additional turn of the corepressor helix extends into the AF2 helix and prevents it from adopting an active conformation. Binding of an agonist stabilizes the AF2 helix in the active conformation and promotes coactivator interactions. Conversely, binding of an antagonist prevents the AF2 helix from assuming the active position and, thus, promotes corepressor binding. Unlike other ligand-dependent nuclear receptors, CAR has high basal transcriptional activity (Baes et al., 1994; Choi et al., 1997). This basal activity can be further elevated by addition of an agonist such as TCPOBOP or repressed by an antagonist such as androstanol (Forman et al., 1998; Moore et al., 2000b; Tzameli et al., 2000). In this report, we describe crystallographic and biochemical analyses of the CAR/RXR heterodimer. The crystal structure reveals a unique CAR/RXR interface and a compact CAR LBD that contains several features that account for its constitutive activity as well as for its ligand and coactivator specificities. Results Purification and Characterization of the CAR/RXR Heterodimer Mouse CAR LBD was expressed either in the presence or in the absence of RXR and purified to homogeneity through glutathione affinity and anion exchange chromatography (Figure 1A). To determine the functional activity of the purified proteins, we used an Amplified Luminescence Proximity Homogenous Assay (AlphaScreen, PerkinElmer) to measure the interaction of the receptors with a peptide containing the third LXXLL motif from the coactivator TIF2. Donor and acceptor beads were attached to the TIF2 peptide and the nuclear receptors, respectively, to perform this assay. When the TIF2 peptide and nuclear receptors interact, excitation with a laser beam at 680 nm causes the donor bead to emit single oxygen molecules that activate the fluorophores in the acceptor bead, and light is released at 520­620 nm. As shown in Figure 1B, the presence of either CAR or the TIF2 peptide alone produced only a weak signal, but incubation of the two together yielded a 68-fold increase in fluorescence. Similar results were obtained with the CAR/RXR heterodimer. This high basal interaction with the TIF2 coactivator motif occurred in the absence of any ligand, which is consistent with the constitutive activity of CAR. Addition of TCPOBOP further enhanced the CAR/TIF2 interaction in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C). The potency of TCPOBOP for enhancing the CAR/coactivator interaction is 243 nM for the CAR LBD alone and 83 nM for the CAR/RXR heterodimer, which agrees well with the EC50 of 100 nM in cell based reporter assays (Moore et al., 2000b). Androstanol is a potent antagonist (or inverse agonist) for CAR in cell-based reporter assays (Forman et al., 1998). In AlphaScreen assays, androstanol disrupted the basal interaction between CAR and the coactivator motif with an IC50 of 183 nM for the CAR LBD alone and 60 nM for CAR/RXR heterodimer (Figure 1C). Androstanol also promoted the binding of a SMRT corepressor motif to CAR (data not shown). Interestingly, the potency of androstanol and TCPOBOP is roughly three times higher

for the CAR/RXR heterodimer than that for CAR alone (Figure 1C), suggesting that RXR increases the ligand binding affinity of CAR. To determine the quantitative effect of RXR and TCPOBOP on the binding affinity of coactivator to CAR, we performed peptide competition experiments with an unlabeled TIF2 motif (Figure 1D). In the absence of ligand, CAR bound to the TIF2 motif with an IC50 of 24 uM. TCPOBOP increased the CAR/TIF2 binding affinity by 48-fold to an IC50 of 0.5 uM. The presence of the RXR moiety in the heterodimer further increased CAR's affinity for the TIF2 motif by approximately 5-fold to an IC50 of 100 nM. These results demonstrate that RXR is important for CAR ligand binding and coactivator recruitment, both of which are key requirements for activation of the receptor heterodimer. Dimeric Arrangement of the CAR/RXR Complex Because RXR increased the affinity of CAR for both ligands and coactivator motifs, we crystallized the CAR/ RXR LBD complex in the presence of 9cRA, TCPOBOP, and the TIF2 coactivator peptide (see Experimental Procedures). Crystals comprising this complex were readily obtained and formed in P1 space group with four heterodimer complexes in the unit cell. The structure was determined by the molecular replacement method with the RXR LBD/9cRA/SRC-1 peptide complex (Gampe et al., 2000) and a CAR model based on the VDR LBD as sequential searching models (Rochel et al., 2000). The electron density map calculated from the molecular replacement solutions showed clear features for the RXR and CAR LBDs (including the C-terminal carboxylate group and the AF2 helix of CAR), the respective RXR and CAR ligands, and the two bound TIF2 LXXLL motifs. The statistics for the datasets and the refined structure are summarized in Table 1. Figure 2A shows two views of the overall arrangement of the CAR/RXR LBD heterodimer, which is shaped like a butterfly when viewed from the front. Each LBD adopts a helical sandwich fold that is conserved across the nuclear receptor family. TCPOBOP and 9cRA occupy the ligand binding pockets of CAR and RXR , respectively. Both CAR and RXR are in the active conformation with the AF2 helix packing against the main body of the LBDs. As with other RXR heterodimers, the CAR/RXR heterodimer is asymmetric with the CAR LBD rotated 10 from the C2 symmetry axis of the RXR LBD (Figure 3A). The dimer interface is composed of helices H7, H9, and H10 and the loop between helices H8 and H9 from both receptors. These structural elements mediate a complex network of hydrophobic and polar interactions between the two receptors (Table 2). The N-terminal halves of helix H10 from both receptors form a coiled-coil structure that comprises the hydrophobic core of the dimer interface (Figure 3C). Surrounding this central hydrophobic interface is an extensive network of hydrogen bonds mediated by helix H7 and the loop between helices H8 and H9 in both receptors. Despite the similarity of the secondary elements in the dimer interface between the CAR/RXR and PPAR / RXR heterodimer complexes, the configuration of the CAR/RXR interface is significantly different from that

of PPAR / RXR (Gampe et al., 2000). This is particularly evident by superposition of the CAR/RXR heterodimer with the PPAR /RXR heterodimer. Although the C atoms of RXR overlap exceedingly well, the C atoms of CAR shift significantly compared to PPAR such that the CAR AF2 helix and the TIF2 coactivator helix move ° 8 A downward relative to those in the PPAR complex (Figure 3A). Compared to the positions of helix H9, the CAR LBD pivots 16 from the PPAR LBD (Figure 3B), resulting in structural changes in the dimer interface between helices H7, H10, and the loop between helices H8 and H9 (Figures 3C and 3D). Helix H10 of CAR rotates one helical turn compared to PPAR , allowing the loop preceding helix H10 to participate in the formation of the core interface. In addition, the orientation of helix H7 in CAR runs parallel to the RXR loop between helices H8 and H9, allowing the formation of a series of hydrogen bonds between CAR and RXR . The PPAR helix H7 is positioned differently from CAR, and the

corresponding hydrogen bond network is not possible in the PPAR /RXR heterodimer. These additional interactions effectively increase the CAR/RXR interface to ° 995 A2, which is 10% larger than the PPAR /RXR inter° face (905 A2). This larger CAR/RXR dimer interface may increase the affinity of CAR/RXR heterodimerization, which may be important for CAR activation and signaling. The CAR LBD Structure Figure 4A shows the CAR LBD sequence and its secondary structural elements. The CAR LBD is composed of 11 helices, two 310 helices (H2 and H2 ), and three small strands that are arranged into a compact helical sandwich fold (Figure 2B). Despite the similar LBD fold, the CAR structure displays three unique features not present in other nuclear receptors. The first and most distinct feature is the short and relatively rigid AF2 helix, which is the shortest among the nuclear receptors stud-

ied so far. The short length of the CAR AF2 helix allows the C-terminal free carboxylate group to interact with K205 from helix H4 (Figure 4B). Residue K205, together with S337 from helix H10, also interacts with other carbonyl groups (which are otherwise uncapped) in the C terminus of the AF2. These additional hydrogen bonds may further help to register the AF2 helix in the active conformation. The second unusual feature of CAR is that the linker region between helices H10 and AF2 is also the shortest linker among nuclear receptors. This linker region normally adopts an extended loop configuration but in CAR adopts a two-turn helix instead. To accommodate this linker helix, helix H10 of CAR is one turn (four residues) shorter than that of other LBDs, which allows the linker helix to pack tightly against helices H3 and H10 (Figures 2B and 4C). This unique arrangement of helix H10 and the linker helix is critical for CAR constitutive activation, because insertion of three amino acids into this short linker disrupts CAR constitutive activity, but not TCPOBOP-induced activation (Dus-

sault et al., 2002). Finally, in addition to the three layers of helices found in other receptors, CAR contains another layer consisting of two 310 helices (H2 and H2 shown in Figure 2B). Both helix H2 and the loop connecting helices H2 and H2 pack closely against the N-terminal portion of H3 and help to rigidify this portion of helix. Because the AF2 helix docks across helices H3 and H10, stabilization of helix H3 should assist in the docking of AF2. In this regard, CAR is most similar to LRH-1, which also contains a rigid and relatively long helix H2 (Sablin et al., 2003). In the LRH-1 structure, helix H2 is packed tightly along helix H3 and forms an additional outer layer in the LBD structure. Notably, the presence of helix H2 is required for LRH-1 constitutive activity (Sablin et al., 2003). In CAR, it is evident that the presence of helices H2 and H2 stabilizes the N terminus of helix H3 by providing an additional helical turn compared with the LRH-1 and VDR structures (Figure 4D). The extension of helix H3 is also observed in the ERR and agonist bound ER structures and is required for agonist-induced ER activation (Greschik et al., 2002; Shiau et al., 1998). The unique combination of structural elements in CAR may help to stabilize its AF2 helix and serve as the basis for its constitutive transcriptional activity.

Ligand Recognition of CAR In the CAR/RXR structure, TCPOBOP is completely enclosed within the bottom half of the CAR LBD. The ligand binding pocket is shaped like a relatively straight rectangular box that is completely surrounded by 31 residues from helices H5, H6, H7, H10, and the two strands (Figure 4C). The AF2 and the linker helix also help to seal one side of the pocket. The accessible ° volume of the CAR pocket is 525 A3, which is less than ° half that of the 1200 A3 PXR pocket (Watkins et al., 2001). Like other nuclear receptors, the CAR pocket is predominantly hydrophobic with only two small hydrophilic patches for possible hydrogen bond interactions. The binding mode of TCPOBOP can be determined unambiguously from the well-defined electron density

map (Figure 5A). TCPOBOP, which has internal symmetry between the A and C pyridine rings, adopts a C shape configuration and is centrally located in the pocket. The ligand is oriented with its A ring toward the strands and the C ring toward helices H10 and AF2. TCPOBOP does not make any direct hydrogen bonds with CAR. The only two hydrogen bonds are mediated through a water molecule that bridges the nitrogen atom of the pyridine rings with the side chain of N175. However, TCPOBOP forms an extensive network of hydrophobic interactions with CAR (Figure 5B). In particular, the A ring is sandwiched between Y234 and F227, whereas the C-ring is sandwiched between Y336 and F244. These aromatic packing interactions help to explain the high affinity binding of TCPOBOP to the receptor. Importantly, the C-ring of TCPOBOP makes a number of direct interactions with AF2 (L353) and the linker helix (L346 and T350). These interactions are likely to stabilize the linker helix and AF2 in the active conformation and, thus, may serve as a structural basis for TCPOBOP-mediated activation of CAR.

these residues in TCPOBOP recognition. Of particular interest, the L346F mutant showed a dramatic increase in interaction with the TIF2 coactivator motif that was little affected by TCPOBOP. L346 is located at the center of the linker helix, and it is predicted from the CAR structure that the large side chain of phenoalanine in the L346F mutation would penetrate into the pocket that anchors and rigidifies the linker helix, thus stabilizing the AF2 helix in the active conformation. In this sense, the L346F mutation mimics the TCPOBOP bound receptor, which further illustrates the important role of the linker helix in the activation of CAR. Recognition of the TIF2 LXXLL Motif by CAR and RXR In the crystal, both CAR and RXR are bound to a TIF2 LXXLL motif, which adopts a two-turn helix with the three leucine side chains oriented into the coactivator

binding site (Figure 6A). Both ends of the coactivator helix are capped by hydrogen bonds mediated by a charge clamp formed by E355 from the AF2 helix and K187 of helix H3. The overall structure of the coactivator binding site and the docking mode of the TIF2 motif are similar between RXR and CAR and resemble those observed in other nuclear receptor/coactivator peptide complexes. Interestingly, CAR also contains a second charge clamp formed by residues R193 from helix H3 and E198 from helix H4. A second charge clamp was first observed in the GR/TIF2 structure (Bledsoe et al., 2002). As in GR, the second charge clamp in CAR forms hydrogen bonds with R 2 and D 6 of the third LXXLL motif in the TIF2 peptide (Figure 6A). The two charged residues R193 and E198 were mutated to alanine, and the mutated receptor was expressed and purified for coactivator recruitment

assays as measured by AlphaScreen to test the role of the second charge clamp in CAR-mediated activation. Mutations in either the first or second charge clamps resulted in a complete loss of basal binding of the TIF2 peptides (Figure 6B). Interestingly, TCPOBOP still induced a 5- to 10-fold increase in the binding of TIF2 to the mutated receptors despite that the binding signal is only 5% of the wild-type receptor. Similar results were also obtained from reporter assays with the full-length mutated receptors (data not shown). Sequence alignments reveal that residues R193 and E198 comprising the second charge clamp are conserved in a subset of nuclear receptors, including VDR and PXR (Figure 6C). The two residues (R 2 and D 6) that form the hydrogen bonds with the second charge clamp are also conserved

in the third LXXLL motifs of the SRC1 coactivator family (Figure 6D). Based on CAR and GR, it is likely that the second charge clamp plays a role in the activation of these receptors. Discussion In this study, we provide a biochemical and structural characterization of the atypical nuclear xenobiotic receptor CAR in complex with its obligate heterodimer partner RXR. Our findings provide important insights into the structural features that underlie the high basal transcriptional activity of CAR and its different ligand binding profiles across species. Notably, the structure reveals that the CAR ligand binding pocket is markedly

Crystal Structure of CAR/RXR Heterodimer 901

smaller than that found in the closely related receptor PXR, suggesting that these receptors evolved to detect and detoxify distinct classes of harmful xenobiotics. CAR Constitutive Activity Activation of nuclear receptors requires that the AF2 helix be precisely positioned to complete a charge clamp pocket into which coactivators dock. In many nuclear receptors, the position of the AF2 helix is controlled by ligands. However, CAR has high basal activity that is independent of agonist binding. Mutations that destabilize the AF2 helix abolish CAR constitutive activity, demonstrating that the AF2 helix is required for this ligand-independent activity (Dussault et al., 2002; Frank et al., 2004). The crystal structure reveals that CAR has evolved three structural elements that stabilize the AF2 helix in the active configuration in the absence of a ligand. First, the presence of the short linker helix before the CAR AF2 is unique among nuclear receptors. This linker region normally adopts an extended loop in other nuclear receptors but folds into a two-turn helix in CAR. The stability of this linker has been shown to be critical for activation of PPARs. P467L, a mutation in the PPAR loop found in diabetes patients, dramatically reduces ligand-dependent PPAR activation (Barroso et al., 1999). The tyrosine-based agonist GW9845 serves as a PPAR agonist by stabilizing this loop but as an antagonist of PPAR and by destabilizing the corresponding loops (Stanley et al., 2003). Similarly, the insertion of three amino acids into the CAR linker region abolished CAR basal activity (Dussault et al., 2002). Thus, the configuration of this linker region is important for AF2 stability. In CAR, this short linker helix packs tightly across helices H3 and H10 and helps to orient the AF2 helix in the active conformation. The short CAR AF2 helix is a second feature that contributes to its stability. The CAR AF2 helix is the shortest of all the known nuclear receptors and allows the C-terminal carboxylate group to form direct hydrogen bonds with K205 from helix H4. Although K205 is highly conserved among nuclear receptors and has been shown to be important for ligand-dependent activation of RAR, the short length of the CAR AF2 allows the C-terminal carboxylate to form additional hydrogen bonds with K205 from helix H4 and S337 from helix H10. These additional interactions are likely to contribute to the stability of the AF2 helix and the constitutive activity of CAR. Extension of the CAR AF2 helix, which presumably disrupts these additional interactions, abolishes its constitutive activity (Dussault et al., 2002). The third structural element that may contribute to CAR constitutive activity is an extended helix H2 that packs tightly against helix H3. Structure comparisons reveal that the CAR helix H2 aligns well with the loop between helices H1 and H3 of ERR and the LRH-1 helix H2 (Figure 5D). The packing of helix H2 against helix H3 in LRH-1 helps to stabilize the N-terminal portion of helix H3, which contributes to basal activity (Sablin et al., 2003). In CAR, the packing of helix H2 also stabilizes the N-terminal portion of helix H3, which in turn helps position AF2 in the active conformation. However, the extended helix H2 is unlikely to account on its own for CAR constitutive activity, because changes in the linker

helix and the length of AF2 affect its basal activity. Together, these observations indicate that the CAR constitutive activity may require the combination of all three structural elements. CAR Ligand Binding Properties Previous studies showed that CAR interacts with a more limited repertoire of xenobiotics than does PXR (Moore et al., 2000b). Moreover, many of the xenobiotics that activate CAR appear to do so through indirect mechanisms that may involve dephosphorylation (Kawamoto et al., 1999). The CAR crystal structure reveals prominent differences in the ligand binding pockets of CAR and PXR. Notably, the CAR ligand binding pocket is much smaller than that of PXR. The smaller CAR pocket is bounded by the compact structure of the canonical LBD fold, especially the linker helix and AF2, which are ° packed 1.5­2.0 A closer against the main body of the LBD than the corresponding region of PXR. Compared to the tightly bound CAR LBD, PXR appears to expand the bottom half of the domain that encompasses the ligand binding pocket. The large insertion between helices H2 and H3 in PXR forms a hairpin and an helix that overlaps the space that would otherwise be occupied by the loop between helices H6 and H7 of a typical LBD structure and results in the unwinding of helix H6 and repositioning of the N-terminal portion of helix H7 (Watkins et al., 2001). The absence of helix H6, which normally seals the bottom of the ligand binding pocket in other receptors, extends the bounds of the PXR pocket ° downward by 12 A to the beginning edge of helix H3 and effectively doubles the size of the PXR pocket. These differences in the AF2 packing and the architecture of the ligand binding pocket between CAR and PXR are likely to account for their different ligand binding and activation properties. The high basal activity of CAR can be further activated by the binding of TCPOBOP, which appears to mediate its effect through the direct stabilization of the linker helix and the AF2 helix. The importance of these interactions is supported by mutations in CAR residues that contact TCPOBOP such as T350M, which abolish CAR activation (Jyrkkarinne et al., 2003; Ueda et al., 2002). Notably, the effect of TCPOBOP can be mimicked by a L346F mutation in the linker helix, in which the large phenoalanine side chain helps to rigidify the linker helix and allows the mutated receptor to achieve the same level of activation of the TCPOBOP bound wild-type receptor (Figure 5C). In this regard, CAR is analogous to classic steroid receptors like GR, in which dexamethasone also forms direct contact with the C-terminal AF2 helix and the linker region (Bledsoe et al., 2002). It is very likely that the contacts between TCPOBOP and CAR further stabilize AF2 and, thus, enhance CAR transcriptional activity. CAR displays marked species differences in ligand recognition between human and mouse. For example, TCPOBOP is a potent agonist for mouse CAR but does not bind to human CAR (Moore et al., 2000b; Tzameli et al., 2000). Sequence alignment indicates that 10 out of 31 residues that comprise the mouse TCPOBOP binding pocket are different in the human CAR (starred residues in Figure 4A). Most of these differences in the human

Molecular Cell 902

receptor are changes to smaller residues, suggesting that the human CAR may have a bigger pocket. Consistent with this, the accompanying human CAR structure ° ° contains a 675 A3 pocket (versus the 525 A3 TCPOBOP binding pocket), which may permit it to accept bulkier ligands such as CITCO (Xu et al., 2004 [this issue of Molecular Cell]). On the other hand, the specificity of the mouse CAR for TCPOBOP has been shown to reside in the C-terminal region of the receptor (Ueda et al., 2002). Comparison of the ligand binding pocket between the human and the mouse CAR reveals that this ligand specificity results in large part from the change in T350 in mouse CAR to methionine in human CAR (Figure 5D). In the mouse CAR structure, T350 directly contacts TCPOBOP. The T350M mutation would cause a steric clash with the ligand and, thus, abolish the response to TCPOBOP (Jyrkkarinne et al., 2003; Ueda et al., 2002). Mechanism of CAR Deactivation by Androstanol Another unique aspect of CAR is that its constitutive activity can be repressed by androstanol. Our in vitro binding studies reveal that the binding affinity of androstanol is 10-fold stronger than the IC50 value from cellbased transcriptional inhibition assays (Figure 1C). The higher binding affinity from these in vitro studies suggests that androstanol may be a natural ligand for this receptor. Compared with the C shape of TCPOBOP, androstanol contains only a rigid steroid core that fits deeply into the CAR pocket, and its binding to the TCPOBOP pocket would leave a void between the androstanol and helix H10. This void apparently induces the collapse of helix H10 at residue S337 as shown in the accompanying androstanol bound CAR structure and leads to the repositioning of the linker helix and the AF2 helix into an inactive conformation (Shan et al., 2004 [this issue of Molecular Cell]). This change in the position of the AF2 helix by androstanol destroys the charge clamp pocket that is necessary for coactivator binding but opens up additional space to accommodate corepressor binding (data not shown). Thus, antagonism by androstanol may reflect both a collapse of helix H10 that leads to repositioning of AF2 away from its active conformation and the recruitment of corepressors. Atypical CAR/RXR Dimerization Interface RXR serves as the common heterodimeric partner for many of the nuclear receptors including those for retinoids, vitamin D, fatty acids, bile acids, and oxysterols. As such, RXR integrates numerous hormone signaling pathways. The previous structures of the PPAR /RXR and RAR/RXR heterodimers as well as the recent LXR /RXR structure all reveal an asymmetric interface that is mediated through a sequence motif of  K K X R from helices H10 of both receptors (Bourguet et al., 2000; Gampe et al., 2000; Svensson et al., 2003). Comparison of these three heterodimer structures shows that the dimer interface composed by the K repeat motifs of helix H10 are aligned exceedingly well with each other and, thus, serve as the common basis for RXR heterodimerization. Nevertheless, the K repeat motifs of helix H10 are found in all RXR dimer partners, and there are differences in the heterodimerization properties among these RXR part-

ners, indicating that structural features other than the K repeat motifs must influence heterodimerization. Despite the fact that the CAR/RXR heterodimer forms a similar asymmetric complex through the K repeat motifs of helix H10, the arrangement of CAR/RXR is significantly different from other RXR heterodimers. The most prominent differences include a 16 rotation of the ° CAR LBD relative to the PPAR LBD and a 3.0 A shift in the position of helix H10 and the orientation of helix H7. Interestingly, despite the rearrangement of the CAR/ RXR heterodimer interface, the hydrogen bonds between R426 of RXR and the CAR residues E328 and S321 are preserved (Table 2). The corresponding hydrogen bond interactions have been shown to be responsible for allosteric transmission of ligand binding information across the dimer interface in the LXR/RXR, RAR/ RXR, and ER complexes (Nettles et al., 2004; Shulman et al., 2004). This suggests that the CAR/RXR heterodimer may maintain the allosteric communication between partners despite the distinct dimer configuration. The distinct organization of the CAR/RXR complex also results in a larger dimer interface, which may play an important role in the CAR signaling pathway. In its inactive state, CAR is resident in the cytoplasm, where it is associated with heat shock chaperone proteins (Kawamoto et al., 1999; Yoshinari et al., 2003). Only after activation by xenobiotics does CAR translocate into the nucleus, where RXR is already present as either homodimers or heterodimers with other partners. Because CAR's function requires RXR heterodimerization, the larger CAR/RXR interface may ensure that CAR is able to partner efficiently with RXR. Moreover, a previous report showed that RXR heterodimerization is required for the CAR complex to efficiently recruit coactivators (Dussault et al., 2002). CAR is the only RXR heterodimer partner that has a high constitutive activity. Other ligandindependent receptors such as ERR , HNF4 , and LRH-1 activate transcription as homodimers or monomers (Dhe-Paganon et al., 2002; Greschik et al., 2002; Sablin et al., 2003). The larger CAR/RXR dimer interface is consistent with the active role of RXR in CAR ligand binding and coactivator recruitment as shown in Figure 1 and may contribute to the constitutive activity of CAR by stabilizing the heterodimeric complex. In summary, the crystal structure of the CAR/RXR heterodimer provides important insights into the unusual properties of this xenobiotic receptor including its constitutive transcriptional activity and ligand binding specificity. Given the relatively small volume of the CAR ligand binding pocket, the structure predicts that CAR does not bind directly to a broad spectrum of chemicals like the closely related receptor PXR. Instead, it appears that most of the chemicals that activate CAR do so through indirect mechanisms. The marked differences in the CAR and PXR structures highlight the different strategies that have evolved to detect harmful lipophilic xenobiotics.
Experimental Procedures Protein Preparation The RXR LBD (residues 225­462) was expressed from the T7 promoter of pACYCDUET vector (Novagen), and the mouse CAR LBD (residues 117­358) was expressed as a 6 His-GST fusion protein

Crystal Structure of CAR/RXR Heterodimer 903

from the expression vector pET24a (Novagen). The modified fusion protein contains a His6-TAG (MKKGHHHHHHG) at the N terminus and a thrombin protease site between GST and the CAR LBD. BL21(DE3) cells transformed with these two expression plasmids were grown in LB broth at 16 C to an OD600 of 1.0 and induced with 0.1 mM IPTG for 16 hr. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 400 ml extract buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 100 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol) per 24 liters of cells, and passed three times through a French press with pressure set at 1000 Pa. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was loaded on an 80 ml glutathione agarose column. The column was washed with 600 ml extract buffer and eluted with 600 ml gradient to buffer B (25 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 100 mM NaCl, and 20 mM glutathione). The H6GST-CAR/RXR heterodimer, which eluted at 50% buffer B, was cleaved overnight with thrombin at a protease/protein ratio of 1:1000 in the cold room. The H6GST was removed by a pass through a nickel column, and the CAR/RXR heterodimer was further purified with a Q-Sepharose column. A typical yield of the purified protein was about 5 mg from each liter of cells. To prepare the proteinligand-coactivator complex, we added a 2-fold excess of the TIF2 peptide and 5-fold excess of TCPOBOP and 9cRA to the purified heterodimer followed by filter concentration to 8 mg/ml. Crystallization and Data Collection The CAR/RXR heterodimer crystals were grown at room temperature in hanging drops containing 1.0 ul of the above protein-ligand solutions and 1.0 ul of well solution containing 0.1 M diammonium tartrate pH 6.5, 10%­15% PEG 2K, and 3% 1,6-hexanediol. Crystals appeared as thin plates within 2­3 days and continued to grow to a maximum plate dimension of 200­300 m with a thickness of 10­20 m over a period of a week. Before data collection, crystals were cross linked with glutaraldehyde and covered with parafilm oil before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. The CAR/RXR heterodimer crystals formed in the P1 space group ° ° ° with a 68.3 A, b 88.4 A, c 105.5 A, 79.0 , 85.8 , and 67.2 . Each unit cell contains four CAR/RXR heterodimer complexes with 48% of solvent content. A full 360 data were collected from a single crystal with 1 oscillation by a MAR165 CCD detector at the ID line of sector-32 of the Advanced Photon Source. ° The observed reflections were reduced, merged, and scaled to 2.9 A with DENZO and SCALEPACK in the HKL2000 package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Structure Determination and Refinement The structure of the CAR/RXR heterodimer complex was determined by molecular replacement with the AmoRe program (Kliewer et al., 2001; Navaza et al., 1992; Sheppard et al., 1998). The RXR/ 9cRA/TIF2 model, which was taken from the PPAR /RXR heterodimer structure, and the CAR model, which was built on the human VDR structure, were used separately to search for molecular replacement solutions. Four distinct solutions were obtained for CAR and RXR with a correlation coefficiency of 43.6% and an R factor of 42.1%, consistent with four heterodimer complexes within each asymmetry unit. The phases from the molecular replacement solution were extensively refined with solvent flattening, histogram matching, and 4-fold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS), averaging as implemented in the CCP4 dm program, and produced a clear map for the CAR and RXR LBDs, the TIF2 peptide, and the two ligands (9cRA and TCPOBOP). Manual model building was carried out with QUANTA (Accelrys Inc), and structure refinement preceded with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) with the maximum likehood target and NCS constraints. Solvent accessible surfaces and Connolly surfaces were calculated with the Insight II (Accelrys Inc.) by using ° a 1.4 A probe, and the result of the dimer interface was presented with Connolly surface (Connolly, 1983). The pocket volume was calculated with Voidoo with the program default parameters (Kleywegt and Jones, 1994). Binding Assays The binding of the TIF2 coactivator motif and ligands to CAR or CAR/ RXR heterodimer were determined by AlphaScreen assays from PerkinElmer as described recently for nuclear receptors (Xu et al., 2002). CAR and CAR/RXR proteins were prepared as 6 His-GST

fusion proteins for the assays. The experiments were conducted with approximately 20 nM receptor LBD and 20 nM of biotinylated TIF2 peptide in the presence of 5 ug/ml donor and acceptor beads in a buffer containing 50 mM MOPS, 50 mM NaF, 0.05 mM CHAPS, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, all adjusted to a pH of 7.4. An AlphaScreen kit for detection of hexahistidine was used in this experiment, and the binding signals for the TIF2/CAR interaction were detected in the absence of any ligands. EC50/IC50 values for the effects of TCPOBOP and androstanol on TIF2 binding to CAR were constructed from a nonlinear least square fit of the data based on an average of three repeated experiments. The relative affinity of TIF2 peptide to CAR was determined by competition experiments with increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptide in the presence or absence of TCPOBOP and RXR . Data were derived from three repeated experiments with standard errors typically less than 10% of the measurements. Acknowledgments We thank W.D. Tolbert and J.S.
