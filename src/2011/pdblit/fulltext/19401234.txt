Phospholipases A2 (Asp49-PLA2s) are enzymes responsible for cellular membrane disruption through Ca2+-dependent hydrolysis of phospholipids. A class of these proteins (Lys49-PLA2s) does not show catalytic activity but can exert a pronounced local myotoxic effect that is not neutralized by serum therapy. In this work, we present five structures of Lys49-PLA2s from snakes of the Bothrops genus in apo form, complexed with PEG molecules and chemically modified by p-bromofenacil bromide (BPB), a classic inhibitor of PLA2. We present herein an extensive structural analysis including: (i) the function of hydrophobic long-chain molecules as Lys49-PLA2s inhibitors, (ii) the role of Lys122, previously indicated as being responsible for Lys49-PLA2s catalytic inactivity and, (iii) a structural comparison of the Ca2+-binding loop region between Lys49 and Asp49-PLA2s. The Lys122 analysis of 30 different monomers for apo and complexed Lys49-PLA2s structures shows that this residue is very flexible and may bind to different carboxyl groups giving stability to the crystal structures. The structural comparisons of the Ca2+-binding loop region between Lys49 and Asp49-PLA2s reveal the importance of the Tyr28 residue conservation in Asp49-PLA2s to the integrity of this loop. The Tyr28 residue stabilizes this region by an interaction with Gly35 residue. In Lys49-PLA2s and low-catalytic Asp49-PLA2s this interaction does not occur, preventing the binding of Ca2+.

1. Introduction Snake venoms comprise a complex mixture of pharmacological components able to affect several biological systems. One of the main components of snake venoms is the phospholipases A2 (PLA2s ­ EC 3.1.1.4), which are small and stable molecules (14­18 kDa) found in a great diversity of organisms and biological fluids (Schaloske and Dennis, 2006). These enzymes hydrolyze fatty acids from the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids, releasing lysophospholipids and free fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, which are involved in many important biological processes (Tsuboi et al., 2002). Arachidonic acid molecules, for example, can be converted to eicosanoids which serve as secondary messengers in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes including sleep

regulation, immune responses, inflammation, and pain perception (Moolenaar et al., 2004). Otherwise, the lysophospholipids can serve as precursors for lipid mediators involved in cell proliferation, survival and migration and in many inflammatory processes (Moolenaar et al., 2004; Prescott et al., 2000). The catalytic site of snake venom PLA2 (svPLA2s) is composed of four residues; His48, Asp49, Tyr52 and Asp99 (Magro et al., 2009). Two action mechanisms for svPLA2s were proposed (Rogers et al., 1996; Scott et al., 1990) and in both, His48 and Asp49 play essential roles, in coordinating catalytic waters and mobilizing the Ca2+ ion, respectively. Furthermore, several biochemical studies demonstrated that the Ca2+ ion is an obligatory cofactor for sPLA2s catalysis. Studies of its replacement by other divalent ions (Cd2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Mg2+) showed that these ions were unable to keep the substrate bound to the enzyme, with the exception of the Cd2+ which allows the toxin to bind to the substrate although without catalytic activity (Yu et al., 1993). This can be explained by different coordination geometries assumed by the tetrahedral intermediate due to the presence of the Cd2+ and Ca2+ ions, which determine the elec-

trophilic behavior of the catalytic site (Yu et al., 1993). However, later experiments demonstrated that Ni2+ and Co2+ ions support a significant catalytic hydrolysis of phospholipids with determined head groups (Yu et al., 1998). These results can be also attributed to differences in coordination geometry and indicate a noteworthy plasticity of the active site environment (Yu et al., 1998). A distinct group of svPLA2s, known as homologue PLA2s or Lys49-PLA2s, exhibits a natural replacement of the key Asp49 residue by a Lys49. Lys49-PLA2s are catalytically inactive due to their incapacity to bind the cofactor Ca2+ since the e-amino group of Lys49 occupies exactly the position of the coordinated Ca2+ ion in Asp49-PLA2 (Scott et al., 1992; Holland et al., 1990). Additionally, site-directed mutagenesis with a Lys49-PLA2 showed that a Lys49Asp mutant remained catalytically inactive, demonstrating that not only the single Asp49Lys replacement but also other possible structural changes are responsible for the lack of enzymatic activity. A classic crystallographic study of piratoxin II (PrTX-II), a Lys49-PLA2 from Bothrops pirajai venom complexed with fatty acid, proposed that Lys122 (conserved in all Lys49PLA2s but rare in Asp49-PLA2s) interacts with the carbonyl of Cys29 hyperpolarizing the peptide bond between Cys29 and Gly30. This strong interaction causes an increased affinity for the fatty acid head group, precluding the release of free fatty acid produced after an initial phospholipid hydrolysis and interruption of the catalytic cycle. Strengthening this hypothesis, a structural analysis of eight dimeric Lys49-PLA2s found that Lys122 interacts with Cys29 in both monomers of the structures presenting ligands in their hydrophobic channels. Otherwise, in the structures with no ligands the Lys122 presents an alternative conformation in one or both monomers (Magro et al., 2003). In spite of their catalytic inactivity, Lys49-PLA2s are responsible for inducing myonecrosis by a Ca2+-independent membrane-damaging mechanism which is not efficiently neutralized by serum therapy and can lead to permanent tissue loss, disability or amputation (Gutierrez and Lomonte, 1995). Several studies have shown that segment 115­129 of the C-terminal region, which includes a variable combination of positively charged and hydrophobic residues, is responsible for this myotoxic activity. Recently, the importance of this region was reinforced by the proposal of a myotoxic site of Lys49-PLA2s from snakes of the Bothrops genus that contains, besides Lys20, C-terminus residues (Lys115 and Arg118) (dos Santos et al., 2009). Since the study with the structure of piratoxin-II (PrTX-II) complexed with fatty acid (Lee et al., 2001), a large number of structures of Lys49-PLA2s, in native or complexed forms, have been solved (dos Santos et al., 2009; Magro et al., 2003; Marchi-Salvador et al., 2009; Murakami et al., 2005, 2007; Watanabe et al., 2005), thus necessitating a revision of the position of Lys122 in these new structures in an attempt to more accurately define the role of Lys122 in the catalytic inactivity of Lys49-PLA2s. Furthermore, with this large number of structures, structural comparisons between Ca2+ binding loop regions of Lys49 and Asp49-PLA2s can be very accurate and give important insights into the inability of Lys49-PLA2s to bind Ca2+ cofactor. In order to carefully discuss these points, we present, in this study, five crystal structures of bothropstoxin-I, a Lys49-PLA2 isolated from Bothrops jararacussu venom: two of them in native form, each with a different number of molecules in the asymmetric unit; two chemically modified by p-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB), a well-known inhibitor of snake venom PLA2s, each with a different number of molecules in the asymmetric unit; and, finally, one structure co-crystallized with PEG 4000. Moreover, these complexed structures from the same protein enable a structural comparison between two different types of Lys49-PLA2 ligands: (i) bound to the ``active site" (e.g. BPB) and (ii) occupying the hydrophobic channel (e.g. PEG 4000; a-tocopherol).

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Purification and chemical modification BthTX-I was isolated from Bothrops jararacussu snake venom by ion-exchange chromatography on CM-Sepharose (Homsi-Brandeburgo et al., 1988). Modification of His48 with q-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB) was carried out as previously described (Diaz-Oreiro and Gutierrez, 1997). Briefly, approximately 3 mg of the BthTX-I was dissolved in 1 ml of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0; and 150 ll of BPB solution (0.8 mg.mlÀ1 in ethanol) was added. The mixture was incubated for 24 h and the excess reagent was removed by ultrafiltration, followed by lyophilization. 2.2. Dynamic light scattering The dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed with native BthTX-I at the crystallization temperature (291 K) at the concentration of 3.2 mg.mlÀ1 using a DynaPro TITAN instrument (Wyatt Technology). The results were analyzed with the Dynamics v.6.10 software. The data were measured one hundred times in triplicate. 2.3. Crystallization Crystallization experiments were performed with lyophilized samples of native BthTX-I and BthTX-I/BPB dissolved in ultra-pure water at the concentration of 12 mg.mlÀ1. Crystals of these complexes were obtained by the conventional hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method (McPherson, 2003) using the sparse-matrix method (Jancarik and Kim, 1991) with Crystal Screen I (Hampton Research). Crystals of the apoBthTX-I were obtained with: one (apo-mBthTX-I) and two (apo-dBthTX-I) molecules in the asymmetric unit, BthTX-I chemically modified by p-bromophenacyl bromide (BPB) also with one (mBthTX-I/BPB) and two (dBthTX-I/BPB) molecules in the asymmetric unit and BthTX-I complexed with PEG 4000 (BthTX-I/PEG4K). Crystallization conditions are shown in Table 1. 2.4. X-ray data collection and processing X-ray diffraction data were collected using a synchrotron-radiation source (MX1 and MX2 stations ­ LNLS, Campinas, Brazil) with a MAR CCD imaging-plate detector (MAR Research). Crystals were mounted in a nylon loop and flash cooled in a stream of nitrogen at 100 K using no cryoprotectant. Data were processed using the HKL program package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). Data-processing statistics are presented in Table 1. 2.5. Structure determination and refinement The structures were solved by the molecular replacement method using the program AmoRe (Navaza, 1994) and coordinates of Lys49-PLA2 PrTX-I (PDB ID 2q2j) (dos Santos et al., 2009). The model choice was based on the best results of correlation and R-factor from the AMoRe program. After a cycle of simulated annealing refinement using the CNS program (Brunger et al., 1998), the electron densities were inspected and the amino acid sequence was inserted. The modeling process was always performed by manual rebuilding with the program Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). Electron density maps calculated with coefficients 2|Fobs| À 1|Fcalc| and simulated annealing omit maps calculated with analogous coefficients were generally used. The models were improved, as judged by the free R-factor (Brunger et al., 1998), through rounds of crystallographic refinement (positional and restrained isotropic

The dictionaries of residue His48­BPB employed by CNS, REFMAC and Coot programs were obtained from the structure of BthA-I/BPB (PDB ID 1Z76) (Magro et al., 2005). Ions and solvent molecules were also added and refined with the program REFMAC. The refinement statistics for the final models are shown in Table 2. In the structure of dBthTX-I/BPB, substitution of some residues were necessary due to the lack of electron density in side chains (monomer A: Lys36 ? Gly, Lys106 ? Ala, Lys122 ? Gly and Lys127 ? Gly; monomer B: Lys69 ? Ala and Lys122 ? Ala). The quality of the models was checked with the RAMPAGE program (Lovell et al., 2003). The contacts between the proteins and the ligands were analyzed with the LIGPLOT program (Wallace et al., 1995). The

coordinates were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the identification codes 3I3I (apo-mBthTX-I), 3HZD (apo-dBthTXI), 3HZW (dBthTX-I/BPB), 3IO3 (mBthTX-I/BPB) and 3IQ3 (BthTXI/PEG4K). 2.6.

All the figures were generated by the Pymol (DeLano, 2002) and ``O" (Jones et al., 1991) programs. Analysis of the quaternary assemblies and interfacial contacts of the crystallographic models were performed using the online interactive tool PISA (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007) available at the European Bioinformatics Institute server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk). Two different angles, hA (aperture angle) and hT (torsional angle) were used to quantify the oligomeric changes between the apo and complexed forms according to a model previously proposed (dos Santos et al., 2009). In this model, the coordinates (x,y,z) of Ca atoms from the a-helices h2 and h3 were used to define two vectors (A and B) whose scalar product defined the aperture angle (hA). The torsional angle (hT) is calculated by using the normal plane formed by the vectors A and B from one monomer and the vector B from the other monomer.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Overall structures The crystals diffracted in the range between 1.48 Å and 2.28 Å (Table 2). The two structures that present one molecule in the asymmetric unit belong to the C2221 space group. The structures that possess two molecules in the asymmetric unit belong to: (i) P3121 space group for native structures and (ii) P212121 or P21

space groups for complexed structures. This feature follows the pattern previously observed in dimeric bothropic Lys49-PLA2s (dos Santos et al., 2009). All the refinements converged to final R values between 15.8% and 23.5% (Rfree values between 21.2% and 25.6%) The final models present a better stereochemical quality than expected for structures with the same resolution as indicated by the overall G-factor and by Ramachandran plot analysis (Table 2). The five structures have seven disulfide bridges in each monomer with the following structural features: (i) an N-terminal a-helix; (ii) a ``short" helix, (iii) a Ca2+ binding loop; (iv) two antiparallel a-helices (2 and 3); (v) two short strands of anti-parallel b-sheet (b-wing); and (vi) a C-terminal loop (Fig. 1), similarly to all the other class II PLA2s. In both BthTX-I/BPB structures, BPB molecules are covalently bound to the Nd1 atom of His48 residue from all monomers (Fig. 2A) and the phenacyl group of BPB molecule extends along the hydrophobic channel of the proteins, engaging hydrophobic interactions with Leu5 and Gly30. Additionally, BPB molecules also interact (distance <4.0 Å) with Tyr22, Gly23, Cys45 and Lys49 for dBthTX-I/BPB and Gly23, Gly30, Lys49 and one isopropanol molecule for mBthTX-I/BPB (Fig. 3). The electron density map for BthTX-I/PEG4K structure showed clear positions for three PEG molecules (Fig. 2B). Two of them are positioned similarly to PEG molecules in the BthTX-I/suramin structure and to a-tocopherol in BthTX-I/aT and PrTX-I/aT structures, i.e., interacting with a large number of residues along the hydrophobic channel of the protein (Fig. 4). The third PEG molecule, in a position similar to the PEG molecule in BthTX-I/aT structure, interacts (distance <4.0 Å) with Lys7, Glu10, Gly13, Tyr76 and Trp77 of monomer B (Fig. 4). 3.2. Oligomeric assembly The results of dynamic light scattering experiments at 291 K (crystallization temperature) with apo-BthTX-I indicated a mean hydrodynamic radius (RH) of 2.5 nm with a polydispersity of 10.7% This RH value corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 27 kDa and is, thus, equivalent to a dimer.

Although apo-mBthTX-I and mBthTX-I/BPB present a monomer in the asymmetric unit, the examination of their unit-cell packing using the PISA software (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007) shows a dimeric conformation stable in solution for both structures. The apo-mBthTX-I presents a complexation significance score (CSS) of 1.0, an interfacial area of 528.3 Å2, Gint = À13.0 kcal/mol and Gdiss = 2.0 kcal/mol while for mBthTX-I/BPB the values are CSS of

0.565, interface are of 683.2 Å2, Gint = À27.6 kcal/mol and Gdiss = 5.7 kcal/mol.

common feature for all Lys49-PLA2s lattices solved up to the present (dos Santos et al., 2009). This structural conformation is known as ``alternative dimer" and was proposed because only this assembly is possible for the binding mode of suramin (Murakami et al., 2007) and a-tocopherol (dos Santos et al., 2009) to bothropic Lys49-PLA2s. In contrast to other Lys49-PLA2 structures denominated ``conventional dimer" (Arni et al., 1995, 1999; da Silva Giotto et al., 1998; de Azevedo et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2001; Magro et al., 2003; Watanabe et al., 2005) solved by X-ray crystallography whose interfacial area, Gint and Gdiss values are incompatible with a biological dimer (dos Santos et al., 2009). Small angle X-ray scattering experiments and molecular dynamic simulations also showed that this ``alternative dimer" is the configuration found in solution (Murakami et al., 2007). 3.3. Comparison of BthTX-I monomers Superposition of dBthTX-I/BPB monomers and BthTX-I/PEG4K monomers resulted in Ca atom r.m.s. deviations of 0.67 Å and 0.79 Å, respectively, while for apo-dBthTX-I this value was 1.05 Å. These values are comparable to other Lys49-PLA2s (dos Santos et al., 2009) where a pattern was observed among apo forms, which presented an r.m.s.d. around 1.0 Å while for complexed structures these values are significantly lower. These higher values for apo forms occur mainly due to differences in their C-termini, demonstrating higher conformational flexibility of this region. Table 3 catalogs r.m.s. deviations after the superposition of Ca atoms between monomers of the five BthTX-I structures presented herein. By comparing the monomers from different dimeric structures (apo-dBthTX-I, dBthTX-I/BPB and BthTX-I/PEG4K), it can be observed that one monomer (called herein monomer B) is always more similar to the equivalent monomer of the other structure.

In all cases, the main differences occur in three regions of each monomer: Ca2+ binding loop (residues 29­34), the loop after the b-wing (residues 85­90) and in the C-termini (117­130) (Supplementary Fig. 1), although the major differences are between the C-terminal and Ca2+ binding loop regions in the A monomers. The superposition between the C-termini (residues 117­130) of monomers A from apo-dBthTX-I and BthTX-I/PEG4K resulted in an r.m.s. deviation of 2.40 Å versus 1.24 Å for the monomers B. Similarly, the same superposition between the Ca2+ binding loop regions resulted in deviations of 1.24 and 0.33 Å, respectively, for the monomers A and B. Comparing apo-dBthTX-I and dBthTX-I/ BPB structures, approximately the same differences were also observed after superposition of C-termini and Ca2+ binding loop regions between the different monomers. The superposition between the C-termini of the A monomers resulted in an r.m.s. deviation of 1.91 Å versus 1.09 Å for B monomers. For Ca2+ binding loop region,

the superposition resulted in respective deviations of 1.20 and 0.65 Å, respectively, for the A and B monomers. These structural changes were probably induced by the ligands (BPB or PEG molecules) leading to a new oligomeric conformation where some new interfacial interactions were established. For apodBthTX-I, one hydrogen bond was observed between its monomers (Val31:Lys69) whereas in the dBthTX-I/BPB and BthTX-I/PEG4K structures two new interchain hydrogen bond were established (Asn17:Tyr119 and Tyr119:Tyr119). These hydrogen bonds were induced by the rearrangement of the C-terminus of monomer A which increases the symmetry between monomers when the BPB and the PEG molecules are present at the ``active site" of the protein as observed for PrTX-I/aT and PrTX-I/BPB complexed structures (dos Santos et al., 2009; Marchi-Salvador et al., 2009).

``active site" (e.g. BPB molecule) or hydrophobic channel (e.g. PEG 4000) induces a better order at its C-terminus leading to the establishment of a new interchain hydrogen bond between Tyr119 residues. This phenomenon has been observed in both dBthTX-I/BPB and BthTX-I/PEG4K structures and is also a common feature among the complexed bothropic Lys49-PLA2s and probably is an important characteristic for the myotoxicity of these toxins (dos Santos et al., 2009; Magro et al., 2003). Site-directed mutagenesis experiments also support this hypothesis since a significant decrease in the myotoxic activity was observed after Y119A mutant was tested in vivo (Chioato et al., 2007). 4.2. The role of hydrophobic long-chain molecules for Lys49-PLA2s The structures of Piratoxin-II from B. pirajai (PrTX-II) and NumTX-I from B. nummifer revealed electron densities that were interpreted as fatty acids within the hydrophobic channel leading to the active site (de Azevedo et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2001). More recently, the structure of the complex MjTX-II bound to a fatty acid (stearic acid) was solved (Watanabe et al., 2005). This molecule was found occupying the hydrophobic channel for PrTX-II, NumTX-I, and MjTX-II structures, despite the fact that MjTX-II was co-crystallized with the fatty acid, and NumTX-I and PrTX-II were interpreted as a fatty acid since these molecules were not added to the crystallization solution (Fig. 5). However, the structures of the complexes between the putative fatty acid bound to the PrTX-II and the stearic acid bound to MjTX-II present significant differences. In contrast to the PrTX-II structure, no water molecule was found bound to the stearic acid head group in the MjTX-II structure. Instead, the carboxyl oxygens of the stearic acid form hydrogen bonds with His 48 and Gly 30 and occupy a position similar to that of a solvent molecule in the PrTX-II structure. Due to the inclusion of a water

4. Discussion 4.1. The ``two-angle model" applied to BthTX-I structures Several experiments on bothropic Lys49-PLA2s, including ones utilizing electrophoresis, spectroscopy (Arni et al., 1999; da Silva Giotto et al., 1998), small angle X-ray scattering (Murakami et al., 2007) and dynamic light scattering (the present article), demonstrated that bothropic Lys49-PLA2s are dimeric proteins in solution. Furthermore, the dimeric state is also found in vivo, and is stable even upon heating in the presence of b-mercaptoethanol (da Silva Giotto et al., 1998; Soares et al., 2000). pH-induced dissociation studies also demonstrated a considerable decrease of membrane-damaging activity after the dimeric dissociation (Angulo et al., 2005). Since the BthTX-I structure was solved for the first time in 1998 (da Silva Giotto et al., 1998), the oligomeric assembly for bothropic Lys49-PLA2s has remained the main issue in several other structural articles involving this class of proteins (Magro et al., 2003; Watanabe et al., 2005). In this precursor study on BthTX-I, its proposed molecular hinge model (aperture angle) was based on only two configurations of BthTX-I (``open" and ``closed"). This proposal was subsequently revised (Magro et al., 2003) using seven different structures at higher resolution. More recently, a useful tridimensional configuration model between the monomers has been proposed based on two angles: hT (torsional angle) and hA (aperture angle) (dos Santos et al., 2009). This two-angle model was established for the ``alternative dimer" by the observation that the Lys49-PLA2s complexed to any ligand present a rearrangement of the C-terminus of one monomer thus increasing the symmetry between the two monomers and aligning them in the same plane. This alignment results in lower torsional and higher aperture angles for complexed structures. Then, when these angles are calculated for both complexed and apo Lys49-PLA2s, their oligomeric conformation can be divided into two classes: apo and complexed structures (dos Santos et al., 2009). In the case of dBthTX-I/BPB and BthTX-I/PEG4K structures the calculated angles are, respectively, hT = 53° and hA = 23°; hT = 40° and hA = 28°. These values are similar in the BthTX-I/aT and other complexed structures including PrTXI/aT, MjTX-II/stearic acid, and BaspTX-II/suramin (dos Santos et al., 2009). By contrast, the torsional/aperture angles for apo-dBthTX-I are, respectively, 60° and 7°, which differ greatly from those of the complexed structures but are very similar to the angles found in other apo structures (PrTX-I, BnSP-7, and BnSP-6) (dos Santos et al., 2009). The disorder in apo Lys49-PLA2 C-termini and the action of a ligand to order this region by increasing the symmetry between the monomers have been observed in bothropic Lys49-PLA2s (dos Santos et al., 2009; Magro et al., 2003). The reorganization of the C-terminal region of one monomer when a ligand is present at the

molecule, the supposed fatty acid in the PrTX-II is shifted out one carbon position in relation to stearic acid of the MjTX-II (Fig. 5). Both polyethylene glycol (PEG3350 or PEG4000) and fatty acid molecules are, in general, structurally similar. The main difference between them is that the fatty acid polar head has two oxygen atoms while the PEG molecule has only one oxygen atom. Then,

given that the PrTX-II was crystallized in the presence of PEG3350 and the interaction of ligand with the ``active site" occurred by means of a water molecule (Fig. 5), we suggest the presence of a PEG3350 instead of a fatty acid molecule in the hydrophobic channel where the water molecule would be the oxygen head of PEG molecule.

tures were not crystallized in the presence of polyethylene glycol, thus enhancing the chance of binding of fatty acid in the hydrophobic channel. This doubt only can be resolved with new crystallization experiments that utilize PrTX-II in the absence of PEG3350 or

in the presence of a specific fatty acid molecule. To corroborate this data, the BthTX-I/PEG4K structure was solved to a high resolution (1.5 Å) and also presented electron densities for both monomers within the hydrophobic channel, which could be interpreted ambiguously as polyethylene glycol 4000 molecules. The structures of a-tocopherol bound to BthTX-I/aT and PrTX-I/ aT also revealed the high affinity of Lys49-PLA2s for long-chain hydrophobic molecules by the hydrophobic channel (dos Santos et al., 2009). Recently, the presence of two different binding regions has been proposed for Lys49-PLA2s and membranes: the ``active site/hydrophobic channel" and the ``myotoxic site" (MarchiSalvador et al., 2009). In this hypothesis the hydrophobic channel would be the anchor by which the protein may bind to the membrane phospholipids while the myotoxic site would be responsible for the membrane destabilization. This suggestion may explain why the Lys49-PLA2s have high affinity for long-chain hydrophobic molecules.

4.3. What is the role of Lys122 in the Lys49-PLA2s? In the crystal structure of Piratoxin-II from B. pirajai (PrTX-II), the presence of additional electron density in the active site region led the authors to the hypothesis that a fatty acid molecule associated with a conserved water molecule remains bound to the protein following an interrupted catalytic cycle arrested at the final product release step (Lee et al., 2001). In this model, the Ne atom of the Lys49 neutralizes the formal negative charge of the transition state oxyanion, and the Ne of Lys122 serves as an auxiliary electrophile in substrate hydrolysis. Lys122 would hyperpolarize Cys29­Gly30 peptide by increasing its affinity for the fatty acid, thus trapping this enzymatic product at the active site (Lee et al., 2001). However, after the PrTX-II structure was solved, several other Lys49-PLA2s structures, in apo and complexed forms, have been solved (dos Santos et al., 2009; Magro et al., 2003; MarchiSalvador et al., 2009; Murakami et al., 2005, 2007; Watanabe et al., 2005), thus necessitating a review of the position of Lys122 in these new structures. Table 4 summarizes different structural data of Lys122 for 30 different monomers for apo and complexed Lys49-PLA2 whose coordinates are available in the PDB data bank. There are 12 monomers in which Lys122 interacts with the Cys29 versus 18 monomers where this interaction does not occur. However, the polarization of both monomers in the same structure occurs only for the complexes MjTX-II-stearic acid and PrTX-II-putative fatty acid. apo-Lys49-PLA2s ­ including BnSP-6, BnSP-7, mBthTX-I, dBthTX-I, PrTX-I and BaspTX-II ­ present one or no Lys122­ Cys29 interaction. Other complexes ­ including mBthTX-I/BPB, dBtTX-I/BPB, BthTX-I/PEG4000, BthTX-I/aT, PrTX-I/aT, BaspTX-II/ suramin and BthTX-I/PEG400 ­ also present one or no Lys122­ Cys29 interaction. In some cases, Lys122 side chains lack electron density above 1.2r, probably due to their high flexibility, not interacting with Cys29 or any other residue. Table 4 also shows our analysis of the B-factors for Lys122 side chains. It

can be observed that only seven Lys122 residues present B-factor values compatible with the average of their respective proteins, while all others present very high values (in most cases the values are 50% higher). These results indicate the high flexibility of these residues in the majority of the structures which is not compatible with the polarization process previously proposed by Lee et al. (2001). The analysis of these structures also revealed another interesting structural feature of Lys122. Besides Cys29, this residue can also interact with a carboxyl group from the other residues: Tyr25 in mBthTX-I/BPB; Gly26 in BnSP-6, apo-BaspTX-II and mBthTX-I/BPB; Cys27 in BaspTX-II/suramin, apo-mBthTX-I and apo-dBthTX-I; Leu32 and Gly33 in BnSP-7; and Arg34 in BaspTXII/suramin. Therefore, Lys 122 is a very flexible residue that may adopt random configurations, interacting with different sites of negative charges (Fig 6). Similarly, for MjTX-II/stearic acid and PrTX-II, there would be no functional reason for the Lys122/ Cys29 interaction, like for the other interactions formed by Lys122 in other Lys49-PLA2s. Interestingly, a crystal structure of myotoxic and catalytically inactive Ser49-PLA2 from Echis carinatus sochureki presents an additional electron density in hydrophobic channel that was modeled as lauric acid (Zhou et al., 2008). However, in this class of PLA2s, the interaction with fatty acid is independent of Lys122, since this residue is not conserved for Ser49-PLA2 and there is not any residue capable of hyperpolarizing the Cys29­Gly30 peptide bond. Then, we can hypothesize that the affinity of the hydrophobic channel by fatty acids are related to membrane anchorage rather than Lys49-PLA2s catalytic inactivity, which may, eventually, be aided by hyperpolarization caused by Lys122. As proposed by dos Santos et al. (2009), this interaction causes a side-by-side alignment of the region responsible for myotoxic activity (C-terminus/myotoxic site), allowing the interaction with the membrane. In this hypothesis two functions may be associated

Asp49-PLA2s

Despite the presence of Tyr28 in low-catalytic Asp49-PLA2s, these toxins present a great distortion in the Ca2+-binding loop region (Fig. 6 and Table 5). Fig. 9 shows that Tyr28 side chain in lowcatalytic Asp49-PLA2s does not have the same orientation as the Tyr28 side chains in other Asp49-PLA2s probably due to the interaction of this residue with the Asp49 side chain (Correa et al., 2008). Consequently, the Tyr28­Gly35 interaction does not form, causing the disorder observed in the Ca2+- binding loop region of these enzymes and, consequently, preventing the binding of Ca2+ ion.

5. Concluding remarks Despite its catalytic inactivity, the hydrophobic channel of Lys49-PLA2 is a very intriguing region due to its conservation of most of residues involved in catalytic activity and high affinity for long-chain hydrophobic molecules. On account of the latter characteristic, in this work, we reinforce the previous proposal of Marchi-Salvador et al. (2009) of the two different binding regions of Lys49-PLA2s and membranes, the hydrophobic channel and the myotoxic site/C-terminal, where the hydrophobic channel would be the anchor for the myotoxic action of Lys49-PLA2s. Herein, the controversial role of Lys122 was analyzed in depth, in light of the 30 different known monomers for apo and complexed Lys49-PLA2s structures. The data show that the Ne of Lys122 probably binds to different carboxyl groups in order to stabilize the crystal structures and that its role may be associated with membrane binding rather than hyperpolarization of Cys29/ Gly30. However, if this polarization really occurs, we believe that this interaction is related to membrane anchorage of Lys49-PLA2s, rather than a role in its catalytic inactivity. Finally, a structural comparison of Ca2+ binding loop regions from Lys49-PLA2s and Asp49-PLA2s reveals that the conservation of the residue Tyr28 in Asp49-PLA2s is vital to the structural integrity of this region in these enzymes. This residue stabilizes the Ca2+ binding loop region by an interaction between its Oc atom and the Gly35 amino group. In Lys49-PLA2s that have an Asn residue instead of a Tyr residue in position 28, this interaction does not occur, which contributes to destabilizing the Ca2+-binding loop region and preventing the binding of Ca2+ cofactor. In low-catalytic Asp49-PLA2s, despite the presence of Tyr28, this interaction does not occur, due to its interaction with Asp49 residue which also prevents the binding of Ca2+ ion. The hypotheses raised in this work may be useful for guiding new biophysical and biochemical experiments that may definitively clarify the action mechanism of intriguing snake venom PLA2s and lead to the design of structure-based inhibitors to complement the serum therapy, thus preventing the permanent injuries still caused by these proteins in snakebite victims around the world.

alytic activity. Furthermore, both Lys49-PLA2s and Asp49-PLA2s have a highly conserved catalytic network (His48, Tyr53 and Asp99) with the exception of Asp49 residue in Lys49-PLA2s. Sitedirected mutagenesis experiments with a Lys49-PLA2 showed that Lys49Asp mutant remained catalytically inactive, demonstrating, in turn, that this single mutation is not crucial to the lack of enzymatic activity in these toxins (Ward et al., 2002), and suggesting that the catalytic inactivity of these homologue PLA2s may be related to other structural features. In order to understand the reasons for the catalytic inactivity of Lys49-PLA2s, we performed a structural comparison of Ca2+ binding loop regions from Lys49-PLA2s, Asp49-PLA2s and low-catalytic-activity Asp49-PLA2s (BthTX-II and PrTX-III) which also display myotoxic activity as Lys49-PLA2s (Correa et al., 2008). Table 5 and Fig. 7 show the Ca superposition between the Ca2+ binding loop regions (residues 27­35) from several snake venom PLA2s. This comparison reveals that this loop adopts a similar conformation within Lys49-PLA2s and within Asp49-PLA2s, but when these two classes are compared the conformation becomes very different. Additionally, the low-catalytic Asp49-PLA2s present strongly distorted Ca2+-binding loops when compared to Lys49PLA2s and other Asp49-PLA2s, as previously described by Correa et al. (2008). Amino acid sequence alignment of Ca2+-binding loop region of Lys49-PLA2s and Asp49-PLA2s from several snakes, showed that Tyr28 is conserved for all Asp49-PLA2s while Asn28 is conserved for Lys49-PLA2s (Fig. 8). These are the only strictly conserved residues in the Ca2+-binding loop regions in these proteins. Furthermore, the Tyr28 side chain is also structurally conserved in Asp49PLA2s, with the exception of low-catalytic Asp49-PLA2s (Fig. 9). The structural analysis of Tyr28 of Asp49-PLA2s reveals an important stability feature of the Ca2+-binding loop region. All Asp49-PLA2s (except low-catalytic Asp49-PLA2s) present a conserved interaction between Oc atom of Tyr28 and Gly35 amino group in the range from 3.1 Å to 3.5 Å (Fig. 10) which is also present in other catalytic PLA2s, including pancreatic bovine PLA2 (Steiner et al., 2001). Recently, the lack of this interaction was pointed as responsible for Ca2+-binding loop disarrangement in Ser49-PLA2 Ecarpholin S from Echis carinatus sochureki venom (Zhou et al., 2008). This Tyr28­Gly35 interaction may provide more structural stability for the Ca2+-binding loop which may be verified by the conservation of the distance d (Supplementary Fig. 2) that reflects the aperture of this loop. Table 6 shows that the distance d between Ca atoms of Tyr28 and Gly33 in Asp49-PLA2s (except lowcatalytic-activity Asp49-PLA2s) is approximately 4.3 Å. In contrast, for Lys49-PLA2s, due to the natural mutation Tyr28Asn, the distance d becomes greater than 6.3 Å. This open configuration of Ca2+-binding loop may be one of the factors responsible for the inability of Ca2+ ion to bind to Lys49-PLA2, even when the Lys49Asp mutation is performed by site-directed mutagenesis (Ward et al., 2002).
