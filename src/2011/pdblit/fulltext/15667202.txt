ABSTRACT: Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes and other receptors of diacylglycerol (DAG) bind to this widespread second messenger through their C1 domains. These alternative DAG receptors include munc131, a large neuronal protein that is crucial for DAG-dependent augmentation of neurotransmitter release. Whereas the structures of several PKC C1 domains have been determined and have been shown to require little conformational changes for ligand binding, it is unclear whether the C1 domains from other DAG receptors contain specific structural features with key functional significance. To gain insight into this question, we have determined the three-dimensional structure in solution of the munc13-1 C1 domain using NMR spectroscopy. The overall structure includes two -sheets, a short C-terminal R-helix, and two Zn2+-binding sites, resembling the structures of PKC C1 domains. However, the munc13-1 C1 domain exhibits striking structural differences with the PKC C1 domains in the ligand-binding site. These differences result in occlusion of the binding site of the munc13-1 C1 domain by a conserved tryptophan side chain that in PKCs adopts a completely different orientation. As a consequence, the munc13-1 C1 domain requires a considerable conformational change for ligand binding. This structural distinction is expected to decrease the DAG affinity of munc13-1 compared to that of PKCs, and is likely to be critical for munc13-1 function. On the basis of these results, we propose that augmentation of neurotransmitter release may be activated at higher DAG levels than PKCs as a potential mechanism for uncoupling augmentation of release from the multitude of other signaling processes mediated by DAG.

ferentiation, and apoptosis to modulation of neurotransmitter release and hormone secretion. The different isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) were traditionally believed to be the targets of DAG and of phorbol esters (PEs), strong tumorpromoting agents from the plant family Euphorbiaceae that mimic the actions of DAG (1, 2). However, the identification of several protein families that also bind DAG and PEs has suggested a high degree of complexity in the signaling pathways activated by DAG (reviewed in refs 3-5). Thus, although PKCs are undoubtedly major targets of DAG signaling, it is now clear that other DAG receptors mediate

1090 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 4, 2005 certain key regulatory processes that had initially been attributed to PKCs. However, little is known about how the different DAG receptors discriminate among distinct DAGmediated signals. Well-established "non-PKC" receptors of DAG are the members of the unc13/munc13 family of neuronal proteins (reviewed in ref 6). The functional importance of these large (ca. 200 kDa) multidomain proteins has been demonstrated by the complete block in neurotransmitter release caused by double knockout in mice of the two major isoforms, munc13-1 and munc13-2, as well as by deletion of unc13 in invertebrates (7-10). In addition to an essential function in release, unc13/munc13s are believed to play critical roles in activity-dependent changes in the efficacy of release that likely underlie some forms of information processing in the nervous system. In particular, genetic experiments have shown that facilitation of release at the neuromuscular junction in Caenorhabditis elegans by DAG depends on unc13 (11), and that munc13-1 is the major DAG receptor that mediates DAG-induced augmentation of release in mammalian hippocampal neurons (12). The critical importance of this function is emphasized by the lethal phenotype caused by mutations that disrupt DAG binding to munc13-1 (12). All DAG/PE receptors share a small cysteine-rich domain that is responsible for ligand binding and is known as the C1 domain (13). Ligand binding to the C1 domain induces or contributes to protein translocation to the membrane, leading to receptor activation. Whereas some DAG receptors contain a single C1 domain (e.g., unc13/munc13s), PKCs contain tandem C1 domains (termed C1A and C1B domains). The solution structure of the PKCR C1B domain determined by NMR spectroscopy showed that C1 domains contain two -sheets and a short C-terminal R-helix, and coordinate two zinc ions via two similar motifs (14). Each of these motifs is formed by three cysteines and one histidine that are distant in the sequence, which distinguishes C1 domains from classical "zinc fingers". The crystal structure of the PKC C1B domain in the absence and presence of phorbol 13-acetate later revealed an analogous architecture, and showed that the ligand binds at a groove between two loops at one tip of the domain (15). The apo and holo structures of the domain were practically identical, showing that ligand binding does not require substantial conformational changes. However, PE binding results in a continuous hydrophobic surface that covers one-third of the domain, which probably underlies how ligand binding promotes insertion of the domain into the membrane (15). The structures of the C1 domains from KSR and Raf-1, which do not bind DAG/PE (16, 17), and of the PKC C1B domain (18) have provided additional information about the structural diversity within the C1 domain family, but no three-dimensional structural information is available on C1 domains from non-PKC targets of DAG signaling. It is thus unclear whether the C1 domains of these alternative DAG receptors contain specific structural features that may underlie fundamental functional distinctions, perhaps discriminating between different types of DAG-mediated signals. To gain insight into this question and into the structural basis for DAG-induced augmentation of neurotransmitter release, we have determined the three-dimensional structure in solution of the munc13-1 C1 domain using multidimen-

We find that the overall conformation of the munc13-1 C1 domain is analogous to that of the PKC C1B domain, but the ligand-binding region exhibits striking structural differences. Importantly, a conserved tryptophan residue occludes the DAG/PE-binding site in the munc13-1 C1 domain. Hence, unlike the PKC C1B domain, the munc13-1 C1 domain needs to experience a considerable conformational change for ligand binding. These results suggest that DAG-dependent augmentation of neurotransmitter release may require DAG levels higher than those involved in PKC activation, and that intramolecular inhibition of ligand binding in some C1 domains may provide a mechanism for discriminating among distinct DAG-dependent cellular signals. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Purification. A construct for expression of the rat munc13-1 C1 domain (residues 567616) as a GST fusion protein was generated from a cDNA containing the entire rat munc13-1 sequence (19) by PCR using custom-designed primers, and subcloned into pGEXKG (20). This expression vector was used to generate a construct for expression of the W588 mutant munc13-1 C1 domain, also using PCR and custom-designed primers. Uniformly 15N- or 15N- and 13C-labeled samples of the wildtype or W588A mutant munc13-1 C1 domain were expressed in bacteria grown in minimal media supplemented with 15NH4Cl and with or without [13C6]glucose (CIL, Andover, MA) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. The fusion protein was affinity-purified on glutathioneSepharose (Pharmacia), cleaved from the GST moiety with thrombin (Sigma), and purified by gel filtration in buffer A [40 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 50 µM ZnCl2]. NMR Spectroscopy. All NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C on a Varian Inova600 spectrometer. 1H-15N HSQC spectra for DOG binding studies were acquired on 100 µM samples of the wild-type or W588A mutant munc13-1 C1 domain dissolved in buffer A containing 20 mM CHAPS in the absence or presence of 0.7 mM DOG (under these conditions, DOG is fully incorporated into the CHAPS micelles as judged by 1H NMR spectroscopy). One uniformly 15N-labeled sample and one uniformly 15N- and 13C-labeled sample of the wild-type munc13-1 C domain 1 (1.5 mM) dissolved in buffer A were used for structure determination, which was accomplished using a suite of pulsed-field gradient-enhanced NMR experiments (21-23). Briefly, these included two-dimensional 1H-13C CT-HSQC and three-dimensional (3D) 1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC, HNCO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, (H)C(CO)NH-TOCSY, H(C)(CO)NH-TOCSY, HCCH-TOCSY, 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC, and 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC spectra (150 ms mixing time for the NOESY spectra). Protection of amide protons from the solvent was assessed from the intensities of exchange cross-peaks with the water resonance in 3D 1H-15N TOCSYHSQC experiments. Stereospecific assignments of Val and Leu methyl groups were obtained from examination of NOE patterns in combination with 1 and 2 angles derived from a 3D 13C-13C long-range correlation spectrum (24). All data were processed with NmrPipe (25) and analyzed with NMRview (26). For structure calculations, NOE cross-peak intensities were classified as strong, medium, weak, and very weak, and

Dihedral angles were restrained to the maximum of 22.5° or 1.5 times the standard deviation observed in the TALOS database matches. Restraints to ensure the proper geometry of the two Zn2+-binding sites were incorporated at the final stages of the calculations. These restraints were derived from the Zn2+-ligand and ligand-ligand distances observed in the crystals structures of the PKC C1B domain and the Zn2+-binding domain of DNA primase (PDB entries 1PTQ and 1D0Q, respectively), where the Zn2+ ions are also coordinated by three cysteine side chains and one histidine side chain. On the basis of this analysis, the Zn2+ ions were covalently attached to ND1 of the histidine side chains (2.3 Å bond length), and Zn2+-S, S-S, and S-ND1 distances were restrained to 2.3-2.5, 3.74.2, and 3.6-4.1 Å, respectively. Hydrogen bond restraints of 1.3-2.5 and 2.3-3.5 Å were used for H-O and N-O distances, respectively. Structures of the munc13-1 C1 domain were calculated using torsion angle-simulated annealing with CNS (28). A total of 2000 structures were calculated with the final set of restraints, and the 20 structures with the lowest NOE energies were selected. RESULTS Structure of the munc13-1 C1 Domain. To determine the three-dimensional structure in solution of the munc13-1 C1 domain, we first assigned its 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances using standard triple-resonance experiments. The excellent chemical shift dispersion of this small domain allowed us to assign all backbone and side chain resonances, with the exception of three backbone NH groups from the predicted ligand-binding loops (T575, G589, and I590) that were broadened beyond detection because of chemical exchange. However, we were able to assign all the CH resonances from these three residues on the basis of HCCH-TOCSY data and unambiguous NOEs observed in a 3D 1H-13C NOESYHSQC experiment. Preliminary analysis of NOE patterns revealed that the munc13-1 C1 domain has the expected secondary structure based on sequence homology with the PKC C1B domain. However, the NOE patterns also indicated substantial structural differences in the predicted ligand-binding loops. In particular, we observed numerous unexpected NOEs involving the aromatic protons of W588 (e.g., those illustrated in Figure 1), which suggested that this conserved side chain adopts an orientation completely different from that observed in the PKC C1B domain. Preliminary structure calculations with unambiguous NOE data confirmed that the side chains from the two Zn2+binding motifs, each composed of three cysteines and one histidine, were properly oriented for metal coordination, and structure refinement was performed with restraints to ensure the proper geometry of the Zn2+-binding sites. Final structure calculations were performed using these restraints together with 861 experimental restraints that included 384 long-range NOEs. Figure 2A shows a stereodiagram of a backbone superposition of the 20 structures with the lowest NOE energies, and a ribbon diagram of a representative structure is shown in Figure 2B. The structural statistics are summarized in Table 1. As expected, the munc13-1 C1 domain

contains two antiparallel -sheets with a total of five -strands (labeled 1- 5 in Figure 2), and a short C-terminal R-helix. The predicted ligand-binding loops emerge at the top of the domain in the orientation shown in Figure 2 (labeled loop 1 and loop 2). The structure is well-defined throughout most of the domain, with backbone rms deviations of 0.38 Å for the whole domain and 0.14 Å for the elements of secondary structure. The quality of the structure is also illustrated by low deviations from the experimental restraints and from idealized covalent geometry (Table 1). The small percentage of residues in the nonallowed regions of the Ramachandran map corresponds to I590 in loop 2 of a subset of structures, and can be attributed to a paucity of NOE data in this region of the domain that probably also underlies the lack of structural definition in part of this loop (see Figure 2). However, some conformational averaging likely exists in this region, as manifested by the resonance broadening that prevented observation of some NH groups. W588 Occludes the DAG Binding Site in the munc13-1 C1 Domain. Structural comparisons using DALI (29) revealed that, as expected, the structure of the munc13-1 C1 domain most closely resembles those of the PKC C1 domains among the structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), being most similar to the PKC C1B domain. The munc13-1 C1 domain and PKC C1B domain structures are indeed very similar throughout most of the domain, as illustrated by the backbone superposition shown in Figure 3A, but a conspicuous difference is observed in the conformation of one of the ligand-binding loops (loop 2). In fact, the trace rms deviation between the entire domains, 1.7 Å for 50 equivalent CR atoms, decreases to 0.8 Å for 39 equivalent CR atoms when loop 2 and a few somewhat disordered residues in the termini are not included in the superposition. These results apply to comparisons using the structures of the PKC C1B domain in the absence or presence of phorbol 13-acetate since they are practically identical [the trace rms deviation of 0.28 between the two structures is probably within experimental error (15)]. Superposition of a representative structure of the munc13-1 C1 domain with that of the phorbol 13-acetate-bound PKC C1B domain (Figure 3B) revealed a key consequence of the different conformation of loop 2 in the two C1 domains that was already indicated by our preliminary analysis of the NOE data: the side chain of W588 of the munc13-1 C1 domain, whose location is well-defined despite some structural heterogeneity in loop 2 (see Figure 2A), adopts an orientation

completely different from that observed for the homologous side chain in the PKC C1B domain (W252; see the sequence alignment in Figure 4). Strikingly, the location of the W588

aromatic rings in the munc13-1 C1 domain practically coincides with the location of two of the rings from the PE bound to the PKC C1B domain (Figure 3B). The interactions of the W588 side chain with the groove between loops 1 and 2 in the munc13-1 C1 domain mimic in part the interactions that mediate binding of PE to the PKC C1B domain, but there are also some important distinctions. In the PKC C1B domain, the PE is "sandwiched" between the two loops, making extensive contacts with the backbone atoms of residues Y238-T242 and L251-L254, as well as with the side chains of Y238, P241, L250, and Q257 (see ref 15). As shown by the space filling model in Figure 3C and the accessible surface representation in Figure 3D, in the munc13-1 C1 domain the W588 side chain also packs against the backbone atoms of loop 1 (residues A574-P577, which correspond to Y238-P241, respectively, in PKC; see Figure 4) and the side chains of A574, P577, and L586 (corresponding to Y238, P241, and L250, respectively, in PKC). However, the W588 side chain makes little contact with the backbone of loop 2 because of its different conformation, and instead packs against the side chain of R592 (K256 in PKC). Importantly, one ketone and two hydroxyl groups of the PE, which likely mimic the hydroxyl and ester groups of DAG, form one hydrogen bond with the backbone of loop 1 and three hydrogen bonds with the backbone of loop 2 upon binding to the PKC C1B domain (15). These hydrogen bonds likely make a substantial contribution to the affinity and specificity of C1 domains for PEs and DAG, but are not established in the intramolecular interaction involving W588 of the munc13-1 C1 domain because it lacks these functional groups (note that the aromatic NH group is exposed to the solvent; see panels C and D of Figure 3). Thus, the intramolecular occlusion of the DAG/PE-binding site by W588 in the munc13-1 C1 domain is expected to decrease ligand affinity but not to prevent ligand binding. The different structural behavior of the munc13-1 C1 domain and PKC C1B domain is surprising given the

Accelerated Publications

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 4, 2005 1093 in ref 3) illustrates the high level of sequence conservation among the C1 domains of unc13/munc13 homologues (e.g., 90% of the sequence is identical in the rat munc13-1 and the Drosophila unc13 C1 domains), and the fact that a substantial number of residues are selectively conserved in unc13/munc13 C1 domains but not in other C1 domains. Thus, it seems likely that the structural features that determine the intramolecular occlusion of the ligand-binding site by the W588 side chain in the munc13-1 C1 domain are selectively conserved in the unc13/munc13 family. This proposal is supported by the observation that the homologous aromatic side chains of the PKCR and PKC C1B domains adopt orientations similar to that observed for W252 in the PKC C1B domain (14, 18), but further experimentation will be required to verify this notion for other C1 domains. W588 Is Essential for Binding of DAG to the munc13-1 C1 Domain. Our results indicate that binding of a ligand to the munc13-1 C1 domain requires a large structural change in loop 2 that removes the W588 side chain from the binding site and leads to the proper backbone conformation for hydrogen bonding to the ligand. To obtain evidence supporting this notion, we acquired 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the munc13-1 C1 domain in the presence of CHAPS micelles lacking or containing dioctanoylglycerol (DOG). The detergent caused slight shifts in some of the cross-peaks corresponding to amide groups from loops 1 and 2 (data not shown), indicating weak binding of the domain to the micelles that likely arises from the hydrophobicity of this region. Comparison of the spectra obtained in the absence and presence of DOG (Figure 5A, black and red contours, respectively) revealed that DOG binding leads to broadening of a subset of cross-peaks. Some of these cross-peaks were still observable and exhibited significant ligand-induced shifts, while others broadened beyond detection. These observations can be attributed to slow chemical exchange between the ligand-free and ligand-bound domain, which is expected to induce stronger broadening for the amide groups that experience larger chemical shift changes upon ligand binding. Importantly, mapping the ligand-induced cross-peak perturbations on the structure of the munc13-1 C1 domain (Figure 5B) showed that most of the cross-peaks that broaden beyond detection correspond to amide groups from loop 2 and adjacent residues, which were expected to undergo the largest conformational changes upon ligand binding (see panels A and B of Figure 3). The conformation of loop 1 is expected to be less affected by ligand binding (see panels A and B of Figure 3), but the structural changes in loop 2 and replacement of the W588 side chain with the ligand were also expected to induce significant perturbations in the amide groups of loop 1. Correspondingly, one cross-peak from this loop was also broadened beyond detection, and other crosspeaks from amide groups from this loop and adjacent sequences exhibited significant shifts (Figure 5A,B). It is somewhat surprising that the cross-peak from the indole ring of W588 exhibits only a slight shift upon DOG binding (Figure 5A). However, this indole NH group is highly exposed to the solvent in the structure of both the munc13-1 C1 domain (Figure 3C,D) and the PKC C1B domain (see Figure 1 of the Supporting Information), and hence, it is plausible that its chemical environment is not highly altered by ligand binding. In addition, the observation of a substantial decrease in the tryptophan fluorescence of the munc13-1 C1

considerable sequence homology between these C1 domains (62% of the residues are conserved and 40% of the residues identical) and the fact that the PKC C1B domain also contains a tryptophan in the position homologous to W588 of munc13-1 (Figure 4). Among the four side chains that contact the W588 aromatic ring in the munc13-1 C1 domain (A574, P577, L586, and R592), only A574 is not identical or conserved in PKC. The corresponding PKC side chain (Y238) points away from the ligand-binding site, and its -CH2 group could establish the same contacts with the W252 side chain that are observed between W588 and A574 in the munc13-1 C1 domain. Hence, the fact that W588 packs against the ligand-binding site in the munc13-1 C1 domain but not in the PKC C1B domain appears to arise from differential conformational preferences of the backbone of loops 1 and 2, and perhaps from slight overall structural differences between the two C1 domains, rather than from contacts between the W588 aromatic ring and specific side chains of the munc13-1 C1 domain.

domain upon DOG binding (see Figure 2 of the Supporting Information) provided further evidence for a DOG-induced conformational change involving a tryptophan side chain. Overall, our results strongly support the notion that binding of a ligand to the munc13-1 C1 domain requires a conformational change that is not shared by the PKCR, -, and - C1B domains, and that appears to depend critically on the W588 side chain. The immediate question that arises is why W588 is conserved in the PKC C1B domains, where the homologous side chains adopt a completely different orientation, pointing away from the ligand-binding site. In the PKC C1B domains, this aromatic side chain packs primarily against backbone atoms and a conserved histidine that participates in Zn2+ coordination (see Figure 1 of the Supporting Information and refs 14, 15, and 18). These observations

suggest that such packing interactions may be critical in stabilizing the structure required for binding of DAG/PE to C1 domains, which presumably is adopted by the munc13-1 C1 domain only upon ligand binding. In addition, the hydrophobicity of this side chain is believed to contribute to membrane insertion (13, 15). To test the importance of the W588 side chain for ligand binding to the munc13-1 C1 domain, we prepared a mutant bearing a point Trp588 to Ala substitution (W588A mutant) and tested for DOG binding using 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The spectra did not reveal any significant DOG-induced cross-peak shifts (Figure 5), showing that the mutant does not bind DOG even at the high protein and ligand concentrations used in these experiments. These results strongly support the notion that the W588 side chain of the munc13-1 C1 domain plays a dual

Accelerated Publications role, occluding the binding site in the apo structure and stabilizing the holo structure upon ligand binding. DISCUSSION DAG acts as a second messenger in a wide variety of signaling pathways that naturally involve a diversity of DAG receptors. The numerous isoforms of PKC account in part for this diversity, but it is now clear that several non-PKC receptors such as unc13/munc13s mediate some key DAGdependent signaling processes. Indeed, the functional importance of munc13-1 as a DAG receptor is underlined by the lethal phenotype caused by mutations in its C1 domain (12). Whereas the published structures of several PKC C1 domains had revealed the overall architecture of these DAG/ PE-binding domains and the structural basis for PE binding, it was unknown whether the C1 domains of alternative DAG receptors contain specific structural features that might underlie important functional distinctions. The structure of the munc13-1 C1 domain described here constitutes the first reported structure of a C1 domain from a non-PKC target of DAG signaling and uncovers an unexpected structural difference with the PKC C1 domains, the occlusion of the DAG/PE-binding site by a conserved tryptophan side chain that is at the same time critical for ligand binding. The high level of sequence conservation of C1 domains in unc13/ munc13 homologues (Figure 4) suggests that such an occlusion is conserved in this protein family and that this structural feature may be crucial for how unc13/munc13s mediate augmentation of neurotransmitter release by DAG. The obvious functional consequence that can be expected from the occlusion of the ligand-binding site by the W588 side chain of the munc13-1 C1 domain is a lower binding affinity for DAG compared to the affinities of C1 domains that do not share this feature such as those of PKCs, since binding of a ligand to the former C1 domain requires shifting the equilibrium between ligand-free and ligand-bound conformations. The phorbol binding affinity reported for the munc13-1 C1 domain [kD ) 5 nM (30)] indeed appears to be somewhat lower than those reported for PKC C1 domains under similar conditions [kD values from 0.5 nM to low nanomolar (31, 32)]. These differences were not considered significant given the variability in the kD values measured for PKC, but they suggest that the ligand affinity of the munc13-1 C1 domain could be up to 10-fold lower than those of the PKC C1 domains. Indeed, these differences could be even larger, since it is very difficult to accurately measure these dissociation constants because of the high affinities involved, their dependence on diverse factors such as the amount of phosphatidylserine present in the micelles or vesicles used in these experiments, and the highly hydrophobic nature of the ligands (see, for instance, refs 32 and 33). In addition, kinetic factors may be critical determinants of the levels of DAG required for receptor activation in vivo, since increases in DAG concentration induced by a signal may be temporarily localized to specific sites of the membrane and quickly decrease by lateral diffusion. The occlusion of the DAG-binding site observed in the structure of the munc13-1 C1 domain is expected to impose a kinetic barrier for ligand binding and hence decrease the binding on rate. Combined with a gradually decreasing DAG concentration at the site of action, a slower on rate would also result in munc13-1 activation at DAG levels higher than

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 4, 2005 1095 those required by receptors whose C1 domain does not exhibit occlusion of the DAG-binding site. These arguments lead us to hypothesize that munc13-1-dependent augmentation of neurotransmitter release is activated at higher DAG levels than PKCs. What purpose could a response by munc13-1 at a DAG threshold higher than that of PKCs serve? Discrimination of the multitude of DAG-dependent signals by distinct types of DAG receptors poses a complex biological problem reminiscent of the need for different Ca2+ receptors to respond to distinct Ca2+-mediated signals. For instance, neurotransmitter release is tightly regulated by the influx of extracellular Ca2+ when an action potential reaches a presynaptic terminal, and it would be highly undesirable if release would be triggered by the multitude of unrelated signaling processes that are controlled by changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The selective response of the release machinery to action potentials relies on the use of a low-affinity Ca2+ sensor, synaptotagmin 1 (34), which only responds to the temporarily very high Ca2+ concentrations existing near the Ca2+ channels that are opened by action potentials. Similarly, it seems likely that DAG-mediated augmentation of neurotransmitter release needs to be uncoupled from the multitude of other regulatory processes that depend on DAG. Our hypothesis that munc13-1 is activated at higher DAG levels than PKCs provides an attractive mechanism for achieving such uncoupling that would parallel the selective activation of neurotransmitter release at high Ca2+ concentrations. Although alternative mechanisms for distinguishing between different types of DAG signals can be envisaged and studies in living cells will be required to test our hypothesis, our results provide a nice illustration of how even highly homologous domains may exhibit striking structural differences and how discovery of such differences can open novel ideas about key biological processes.
