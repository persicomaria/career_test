ABSTRACT: Ascorbate peroxidase is a bifunctional peroxidase that catalyzes the H 2O2-dependent oxidation of both ascorbate and various aromatic substrates. The ascorbate binding site was recently identified as being close to the -heme edge [Sharp, K. H., Mewies, M., Moody, P. C. E., and Raven, E. L. (2003) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10, 303-307]. In this work, the X-ray crystal structure of recombinant soybean cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (rsAPX) in complex with salicylhydroxamic acid (SHA) has been determined to 1.46 Å. The SHA molecule is bound close to the -heme edge in a cavity that connects the distal side of the heme to the surface of the protein. There are hydrogen bonds between the phenolic hydroxide of the SHA and the main chain carbonyl of Pro132, between the carbonyl oxygen of SHA and the side chain guanadinium group of Arg38, and between the hydroxamic acid group and the indole nitrogen of Trp41. The structure provides the first information about the location of the aromatic binding site in ascorbate peroxidase and, together with our previous data [Sharp, K. H., et al. (2003) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10, 303307], completes the structural description of the binding properties of ascorbate peroxidase. The mechanistic implications of the results are discussed in terms of our current understanding of how APX catalyzes oxidation of different types of substrates bound at different locations.

The heme peroxidase enzymes (reviewed in refs 1-4) catalyze the H2O2-dependent oxidation of a wide variety of substrates, in most cases small organic substrates. They have been classified on the basis of sequence homology (5) into three types. Class I heme peroxidases contain the prokaryotic enzymes, including cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP),1 ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and the gene-duplicated bacterial catalase-peroxidases. Class II contains the fungal peroxidase enzymes, including manganese peroxidase and lignin peroxidase. Class III contains the classical secretory peroxidases, the most notable example being horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Mechanistically, these enzymes are very well characterized; they share a common catalytic cycle that involves formation of a two equivalent oxidized intermediate, known as Compound I, followed by reduction of Compound I by substrate (eqs 1-3, where P is peroxidase, HS is the

Much of the structure-function work (1-4, 6-8) on the heme peroxidases has focused on Compound I formation (eq 1), and a consistent picture of this step has emerged: the peroxidases have very similar heme active site structures that, in all cases, have been designed to support formation of the high valent Compound I intermediate. In contrast, the identity of the substrate (eqs 2 and 3) varies enormously (it can be a metal ion, an organic/phenolic substrate, or a protein molecule), and it is this variety in substrate specificity, and not Compound I formation, that delivers the rich diversity of function across the peroxidase family. It follows that to understand biological function, we need an experimental framework that allows detailed rationalization of substrate binding. On the whole, however, our understanding of the structural features that define substrate specificity in the heme peroxidase enzymes is poorly developed compared to our understanding of Compound I formation. This is in part because structural information for peroxidase-substrate complexes has been slower to emerge (9-17), but is also because, in

some cases (9, 12), the substrate is atypical and has not, therefore, provided the necessary generic insight. A lack of comparative substrate binding information, to allow connections to be made between different peroxidases, has also been prohibitive. Within this wider framework, it was recently realized that ascorbate peroxidase (APX), which catalyzes the H2O2dependent oxidation of ascorbate (18-20), has structural, functional, and substrate binding properties that places it at an important interface between peroxidases [a distinction that has been highlighted recently (21)]. Hence, the sequence of APX is highly identical with the most prominent and wellcharacterized class I peroxidase, CcP, as well as with the bacterial catalase-peroxidases. In addition to ascorbate, APX is also able to catalyze the oxidation of a variety of aromatic substrates [e.g., p-cresol, guaiacol, pyrogallol, o-dianisidine, and 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS)] that are typical of the class II and class III peroxidases (21, 22). In some cases, oxidation of these aromatic substrates is faster than oxidation of ascorbate itself (18), and it is likely that this is linked to a physiological role, since there are high levels of phenolic compounds present in planta. Altogether, the close sequence identity to CcP coupled with its bifunctional substrate specificity that mimics that of the class II and III peroxidases makes APX an exceptionally useful comparative model for our general understanding of substrate binding because it provides an overarching framework that encompasses many features that have, so far, only been found separately. It is only recently that detailed information about substrate binding in APX has appeared. The hypothesis that has emerged is as follows (23-25). There are two, separate substrate binding locations. The first, close to the -meso (C15) position of the heme (Figure 1), is utilized by ascorbate; the second is used primarily by aromatic substrates (23), but its location is not known. We have recently determined the crystal structure of recombinant soybean cytosolic APX (rsAPX) in complex with ascorbate (26). The structure has confirmed the -heme edge as the primary site of oxidation of ascorbate and provides the first comparative rationalization of the different substrate specificities of APX and CcP. In this work, we have identified the second, aromatic binding site by determining the crystal structure of rsAPX in complex with salicylhydroxamic acid (SHA, Figure 2). Together with our previous data (26), this now provides a complete description of substrate binding in APX.

Salicylhydroxamic acid contains two acidic protons on the phenolic [pKa ) 9.8 (33)] and hydroxamic acid [pKa ) 7.4 (33)] groups.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Purification and Preparation of Crystals. Recombinant soybean cytosolic APX (rsAPX) was prepared from Escherichia coli SG1300 (pREP4) by incorporation of a pQE30-derived expression vector and purified as described previously (27). The final elution from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (Qiagen) was carried out using pH (4.2) rather than using imidazole, and the heme reconstitution step was carried out and then left overnight rather than over 15 min as described. Samples prepared in this way eluted as a single band by SDS-PAGE and by FPLC using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column. Purity was also assessed using the ratio of absorbancies at the Soret and 280 nm peaks. For rsAPX, samples with an A407/A280 of greater than 2.0 were considered pure. Samples (20 mg/mL) were stored in deionized water in 50 µL aliquots. Enzyme concentrations were determined using the molar absorption coefficient for rsAPX [ 407 ) 107 mM-1 cm-1 (27)]. Samples of rsAPX were assayed (100 mM phosphate at pH 7.0 and 25.0 °C) against guaiacol using established protocols (27) and using an 470 of 22.6 mM-1 cm-1 (28). Data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Crystals of rsAPX were prepared as described previously (26). The best crystals grew to 150 µm in length and 75 µm in cross section. Guaiacol is too insoluble in water for sufficiently high concentrations to be obtained in solution for soaking into rsAPX crystals. Guaiacol is soluble in EtOH or MeOH, but attempts to soak it (at various concentrations in EtOH or MeOH) into the crystals resulted in cracking of the crystals under all conditions that were attempted. Solubility can be improved by functionalization of the methoxy group with the (more hydrophilic) hydroxamic acid group. In this case, it was possible to obtain crystals of the rsAPX-SHA complex by soaking the crystals in a mother

RESULTS liquor solution containing 100 mM SHA (Aldrich, 99.0%) for approximately 1 min. The SHA was dissolved by adding 1 M sodium hydroxide to the mother liquor to adjust the pH to 10. The pH was then returned to 8.3 by adding hydrochloric acid. Equilibrium Binding Constants. Equilibrium dissociation constants, Kd (100 mM potassium phosphate at pH 8.3), for the binding of SHA to rsAPX were determined using electronic spectroscopy according to previously published procedures (29) by addition of known amounts of SHA to rsAPX (5 µM rsAPX). Additions of SHA were determined gravimetrically. Binding constants were determined from plots of fractional saturation versus free ligand concentration according to published procedures (29). On the basis of pHdependent binding data, which show an increase in Kd with pH that corresponds with the pKa of the SHA, it has been reported that only the neutral form of SHA binds (30-32). Binding of SHA to rsAPX was also found to be pHdependent (not shown), and we have therefore corrected binding data for ionization [pKa ) 7.4 (33)] of the hydroxamic acid group of SHA, as previously described (30, 31). Reported values for Kd are an average of at least two independent measurements. Data Collection and Refinement. Diffraction data were collected for the rsAPX-SHA complex on beam-line ID14-4 at ESRF (Grenoble, France) using an ADSC Quantum-4 detector. Data to 1.46 Å were collected over a 90° rotation in 0.5° images. All data were collected at 100 K. Data collection statistics are shown in Table 1, and 5% of the data were flagged for the calculation of Rfree and excluded from subsequent refinement. The structure was refined from a model derived from the 1.45 Å rsAPX-ascorbate complex (26) (Protein Data Bank entry 1OAF) by the removal of bound ligand and water molecules. Several cycles of refinement using REFMAC5 from the CCP4 suite (34) and incorporation of solvent molecules gave a model with a crystallographic R-factor for all data of 15.5% and an Rfree of 18.5%. The electron density for SHA was clear and unambiguous; the structure was incorporated into the last cycles of refinement. XTALVIEW (35) was used throughout for manual adjustment, ligand fitting, and interpretation of water structure. The UV-visible spectrum of rsAPX (max ) 407, 505, and 637 nm) and the rsAPX-SHA complex are shown in Figure 3. Addition of SHA leads to an increase in intensity and a red shift of the Soret band from 407 to 418 nm. New bands at 540, 580, and 630 nm appear. These changes are consistent with the formation of a predominantly sixcoordinate heme derivative in the presence of SHA. A binding constant, Kd, of 8 ( 1 µM was determined for the rsAPX-SHA interaction (100 mM phosphate at pH 8.3) (data not shown). Binding of SHA to the heme will inhibit peroxidase activity by competing with H2O2, which is analogous to the binding of other strong ligands (e.g., cyanide). At high concentrations of SHA, the kcat value for oxidation of guaiacol by rsAPX is only 50% of the value observed in the absence of SHA.2 To establish whether binding of SHA is affected by the presence of other substrates, the binding constant, Kd, for SHA was determined in the presence of both ascorbate (25 mM) and guaiacol (25 mM). In this case, the Kd for SHA binding in the presence of guaiacol increases (Kd ) 32 ( 2 µM), but the corresponding value in the presence of ascorbate does not change (Kd ) 8 ( 1 µM) (data not shown), indicating that guaiacol and SHA compete for the same site but that ascorbate and SHA do not. When H2O2 is added to a solution of rsAPX and SHA, there is no decrease in the SHA peak at 300 nm, indicating that no oxidation occurs. The overall structure of rsAPX in complex with SHA is shown in Figure 4. Comparison with the structure of the SHA-free enzyme (26) shows that binding of SHA leads to no major structural rearrangements of the enzyme (rms deviation in CR positions of 0.21 Å). However, there is a slight adjustment of the side chain dihedral angle 2 of His42 with respect to that of the rsAPX structure (not shown). The electron density for the SHA molecule in the region of the heme group is unambiguous, allowing its position to be defined with precision (Figure 4). The SHA molecule is located in a cavity that connects the distal side of the heme to the surface of the protein. The mouth of the cavity is
2 Competitive inhibition experiments with rsAPX and ascorbateH2O2 in the presence of SHA were not carried out because SHA absorbs intensely at the wavelengths used for ascorbate assays (290 or 260 nm). The corresponding experiment with guaiacol showed a change in both KM and kcat. This may be due to the fact that both H2O2 and guaiacol are inhibited by SHA; these experiments were not pursued further, therefore.

Trp41 is conserved in all but two APXs (Mesembryanthemum crystallinum APX and a membrane-bound enzyme from spinach which contain Phe at this position3). Although N of the distal histidine (His42) is 3.0 Å from the phenolic oxygen of SHA, the geometry is poor for formation of a hydrogen bond between His42 and SHA. The aromatic ring of the SHA molecule is almost parallel to the heme

The CR and C atoms of Ala70 are within van der Waals distance of the SHA (3.5 Å, Figure 4). Figure 6 shows an overlay of the rsAPX-ascorbate (26) and rsAPX-SHA structures; this clearly highlights the different binding locations of the SHA and ascorbate close to the - and -heme edge, respectively. DISCUSSION The identification of an ascorbate binding site close to the -heme edge (26) was counter to established thinking in

which substrate binding and oxidation at the -heme edge had been widely assumed. However, most APXs that have been identified so far are also functionally competent for oxidation of aromatic substrates, and in some cases, oxidation of aromatic substrates occurs at a rate comparable to the rate of oxidation of ascorbate itself (18, 22). The identity of this second substrate binding location was not known, but the region close to the -heme edge has been directly implicated (23, 24). The data presented in this work now complete the structural definition of the two binding sites in APX and confirm the -heme edge as the binding site for aromatic molecules. The structure is consistent with our steady-state data that show that APX modified at the -heme edge using phenylhydrazine retains 10% activity with ascorbate but is inactive against guaiacol (data not shown). The structure also provides rationalization of the empirical observation (37) that salicylic acid (2-hydroxybenzoic acid, Figure 2) is a (slow) substrate for APX with a possible role in planta. For salicylic acid, coordination to the iron is not observed (37) but the main hydrogen bonding interactions between Pro132 and Arg38 (Figure 5) are still possible. Comparison with Other Peroxidases. In the following discussion, we correlate these structural data with our current understanding of substrate binding and oxidation in other class I, class II, and class III peroxidase enzymes. In Figure 7, we compare the rsAPX-SHA structure with the structures of the HRP-BHA complex (13) (Figure 7A), the ARPBHA complex (15) (Figure 7B), and the ARP-SHA complex (38) (Figure 7C). It is clear from Figure 7 that the binding location of the substrate for all the structures is similar and close to the -heme edge. (We note also that oxidation of guaiacol has been reported to be inhibited by the presence of BHA (21), indicating that BHA also binds at the same -heme site in APX.) In all cases, there are hydrogen bonding interactions between the backbone carbonyl of a proline and between the distal arginine residue and the carbonyl of the BHA or SHA molecule; the distal histidine hydrogen bonds to the substrate in the HRP and ARP structures, but not in rsAPX.4 There are other differences. For the HRP and ARP structures, the interaction with
4 The distal histidine and arginine groups, and the main chain carbonyl of proline, are also involved in binding of ferulic acid to HRP (14).

the heme iron is via a water molecule (compared to through the hydroxyl group of the SHA in rsAPX) and the proline carbonyl interacts with the NH group of the hydroxamic group (compared to the phenolic group of SHA in rsAPX). Altogether, the bound ligand for the HRP and ARP structures is displaced by approximately a bond length from the binding pocket relative to SHA in rsAPX. It is possible that the additional hydrogen bonding interaction between SHA and Trp41 in rsAPX (Figure 5) is partly responsible for this difference (Trp41 is replaced with a Phe in both HRP and ARP). Might this binding site be used more generally for oxidation of related aromatic substrates in other class I peroxidases? Cytochrome c peroxidase is known (39) to bind aromatic substrates at a different location compared to cytochrome c (40), and the -meso heme edge has been implicated (40, 41). This is consistent with our data because the key hydrogen-bonding residues (Arg38, Trp41, and Pro132) are conserved in CcP (Arg48, Trp51, and Pro145, respectively) and because CcP contains a similar binding pocket as identified in APX. Mechanistic and Functional Implications. In light of these new data, and with the location of both the ascorbate (26) and aromatic binding sites in APX now defined, it is appropriate to correlate the new structural information with functional data and to consider the broader mechanistic question of how APX might most effectively deal with oxidation of different types of substrates bound at different locations. For ascorbate oxidation, our data (26) show direct coupling of the heme to the substrate through the 6-propionate and electron transfer to the heme is presumed to be facile. The data presented in this work show SHA to be in van der Waals contact with the porphyrin -system, and for aromatic substrates, we therefore assume that electron transfer is directly through the -orbitals of the porphyrin. Reduction of both Compound I and Compound II by both ascorbate (at the -heme edge) and aromatic substrates (at the -heme edge) also requires proton transfer (eqs 1-3); however, the mechanism of proton transfer is not welldeveloped for any heme peroxidase, and there is no information at all for APX. For ascorbate, oxidation of the (anionic, Figure 2) substrate gives the protonated monodehydroascorbate radical which is very acidic [pKa ) -0.45 for C2-OH

8650 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 27, 2004 (42, 43); Figure 2] and will rapidly deprotonate. A proton transfer pathway from the ascorbate to a water molecule bound to the heme iron is identified that involves Arg38 (Figure 8). (Proton transfer to His42 may subsequently occur in solution, but the crystallographic data do not show a good hydrogen bonding interaction between this water and His42.) This distal arginine residue, which is known to be mobile in CcP (44-47) and which is conserved across all peroxidases (5), is also involved in binding of SHA in rsAPX (Figure 7), so might this residue also provide a conduit for proton delivery for aromatic substrates bound at the -heme edge, thereby providing APX with a common mechanism for proton shuttling during oxidation of both types of substrates? Clearly, this has yet to tested experimentally, but it would be consistent with the idea that APX is a hybrid enzyme that combines features that are characteristic of both class I and class III peroxidases (21) and with the suggestion that Arg38 in HRP is involved in proton transfer during oxidation of ferulic acid (14).
