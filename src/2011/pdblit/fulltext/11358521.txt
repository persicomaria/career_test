Cytochrome c3, a small (14-kDa) soluble tetraheme protein was isolated from the periplasmic fraction of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans strain Essex 6. Its major physiological function appears to be that of an electron carrier for the periplasmic hydrogenase. It has been also shown to interact with the high-molecular-mass cytochrome complex in the cytoplasmic membrane, which eventually feeds electrons into the membraneous quinone pool, as well as with the membrane-associated dissimilatory sulfite reductase. The EPR spectra show features of four different low-spin Fe(III)

hemes. Orthorhombic crystals of cytochrome c3 were obtained and X-ray diffraction data were collected to below Ê 2 A resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using cytochrome c3 from D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774 as a search model. Keywords: crystal structure; Desulfovibrio desulfuricans; electron paramagnetic resonance; multiheme cytochromes; sulfate reduction.

Sulfate-reducing bacteria of the genus Desulfovibrio are strict anaerobes which derive energy from the dissimilatory reduction of sulfate by dihydrogen or organic substrates. The electron-transport chain catalyzing this reaction involves periplasmic hydrogenases, several cytochromes, and both membrane-bound and cytoplasmic redox enzymes [1]. Cytochrome c3, the marker protein of the genus Desulfovibrio, is a small (106±118 residues, monomeric) soluble tetraheme protein located in the periplasmic space. It is supposed to act as an electron carrier for the periplasmic hydrogenase (hydrogen±ferricytochrome c3 oxidoreductase, EC 1.12.2.1) [2,3]. In studies on Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Essex 6, it was shown that cytochrome c3 can function as electron donor for the membrane-associated dissimilatory sulfite reductase (mSiR; ferrocytochrome c3 ±sulfite oxidoreductase, EC 1.8.99.3), a siroheme and Fe/S centers containing enzyme [4,5]. Its specific activity, using H2 3 hydrogenase/cytochrome c3 3 mSiR 3 HSO2, 3 was 0.1 ^ 0.02 mmol H2´min21´mg21, with sulfide as the major product [4]. The membranous sulfite reductase also catalyzed the oxidation of sulfide by cytochrome c3 with a

specific activity of up to 4 mmol HS2´min21´mg21. Currently, these are highest values reported for dissimilatory sulfite reductases [6]. Oxidation of sulfide has been observed for sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, such as Thiobacillus, and photosynthetic bacteria that contain a `reverse' sulfite reductase and generate reducing equivalents for oxidative and photophosphorylation. Structural information on cytochrome c3 has been obtained from several bacteria of the genus Desulfovibrio [7±13]. It contains four c-type heme groups in close packing with adjacent pairs of heme planes, being nearly perpendicular to each other and barely covered by the small protein matrix. In contrast with eukaryotic cytochrome c, which has histidine and methionine as fifth and sixth ligand of the heme iron, all four heme groups in cytochrome c3 are bis-histidinyl co-ordinated and accordingly exhibit negative redox potentials ranging from 2120 mV to 2 400 mV [10,12,14]. The differences in the redox properties of the four heme groups should be reflected in subtle differences in their structures and protein environment, but the exact determinants of redox potential adjustment are still a matter of debate. Despite a relatively low sequence homology, the tertiary structure of all known cytochromes c3 is highly conserved, showing a typical fold with two short b strands and three to five a helices. Most notably, the degree of conservation is highest for the heme groups themselves [13], an observation that has also been made for other multiheme c cytochromes [13,15,16]. Obviously the evolutionarily conserved motif is the heme arrangement rather than the protein fold. In our attempt to understand dissimilatory sulfate reduction on a molecular level, and to define and to characterize the interplay of the various redox components, we began to analyze the structural, spectroscopic and

functional properties of key electron-transfer proteins and enzymes from the sulfate-reducing bacterium D. desulfuricans Essex. Currently, the main interest is directed towards the multiheme cytochromes, the iron-sulfur flavoenzyme adenylyl sulfate reductase, and sulfite reductase [6,17±20]. The reactivity towards both the [NiFe] hydrogenase and the membranous sulfite reductase led us to purify cytochrome c3 from D. desulfuricans Essex 6, examine its metal centers by UV/visible and EPR spectroscopy, and solve its 3D structure. In addition, detailed spectroscopic and structural information on multiheme cytochromes and multiheme enzymes, such as cytochrome c nitrite reductase and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, will be needed to understand the nature of heme±heme interaction and the arrangement of heme centers in conserved packing motifs [16].

EPR measurements. Simulations of the spectra were carried out using the program epr [24]. Protein sequencing The N-terminal sequence of 35 residues was determined, and then the protein was cleaved by addition of a small crystal of CNBr. The two resulting fragments were separated on a Superdex Peptide HR 10/30 column in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing 25% acetonitrile. Enzymatic cleavage was carried out with endopeptidase Lys-C and Asp-N. In the first case, the peptides were separated by RP-HPLC (Vydac C18) with a linear gradient of 3±42% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. In the case of the cleavage with endopeptidase Asp-N, the small C-terminal peptide was separated from an uncleaved large N-terminal fragment by size-exclusion chromatography on the Superdex Peptide column as above. Subsequently the covalently attached heme groups were cut off with nitrosulphenyl chloride following the protocol of Fontana et al. [25]. Then the apoprotein chain was digested with chymotrypsin. The complex mixture of fragments generated through partial cleavages and cleavage at unusual sites was fractionated by size-exclusion HPLC. Pools of fractions containing peptides needed for sequence alignment as identified by N-terminal sequence analysis were further separated by RP-HPLC as above. Sequencing was carried out with an Applied Biosystems sequencer model 492. Crystallization and data collection Orthorhombic crystals that diffracted to resolutions higher Ê than 2 A were obtained via the sitting drop vapor diffusion method using a precipitant buffer consisting of 30% poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ester 2000, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.6, and 0.2 m ammonium sulfate. Then 2 mL of protein solution at a concentration of 5 mg´mL21 was mixed with 2 mL of this solution and equilibrated at 21 8C against a buffer reservoir. The needleshaped crystals obtained in this way reached a size of 1.0 Â 0.08 Â 0.08 mm and belonged to space group P Ê Ê 212121, with cell constants of a  36.37 A, b  49.39 A Ê and c  70.99 A. Diffraction data were collected on a MAR Research 2000 Image Plate System and indexed, integrated and scaled using the HKL-suite [26]. For phase determination, the method of molecular replacement was applied, with the structure of cytochrome c3 from D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774 ([11]; PDB accession number 2CYR) as a search model. Molecular replacement rotation and translation searches were carried out using the program amore [27]; subsequent refinement of the structure was achieved with cns [28]. The model was built using o [29].

Cell growth and purification D. desulfuricans Essex 6 was grown anaerobically [4]. Cells were broken in a French pressure cell, and the soluble crude extract obtained after centrifugation and ultracentrifugation at 100 000 g was subjected twice to anionicexchange chromatography on a DE52 column. Cytochrome c3 did not bind to this column and was found quantitatively in the wash. Between the two chromatography steps, the buffer was changed from potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, to Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, by dialysis. In the next step, cytochrome c3 bound tightly to a hydroxylapatite column and was eluted with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl. The protein fractions were pooled and concentrated in an ultrafiltration cell to 1±3 mg´mL21. Finally, the concentrated eluate was separated on a Superdex 75 gel-filtration column, with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. All purification steps were performed at 4 8C. Enzyme assays The reduction of cytochrome c3 by reactivated [NiFe] hydrogenase from D. desulfuricans Essex 6 was followed spectrophotometrically at 552 nm under dihydrogen, 25 8C [17]. For the spectrophotometrical measurements, modified Thunberg cuvettes were used, with one side arm equipped with double serum stoppers. The side arm contained the reactivated hydrogenase (20 U´nmol21 cytochrome c3) whereas the cuvette part was filled with a solution of cytochrome c3. The reaction was started by adding hydrogenase from the side arm to the solution of cytochrome c3. Protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method, or the microbiuret method, on a HewlettPackard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer [21±23]. Spectroscopic methods UV/visible spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Lambda 16 spectrophotometer. A Bruker ESP 300 X-band continuous-wave EPR spectrometer equipped with a Bruker ER 4116 DM dual-mode cavity and a Helitran system LTD-3-110 C continuous-flow helium cryostat was used for

for the cytochrome c3 (12.6 ^ 0.7 mm) and the nonaheme cytocrome c (20.5 ^ 0.9 mm) [17].

EPR spectroscopy The EPR spectrum of cytochrome c3 as isolated, recorded at 10 K, is depicted in Fig. 1. Cytochrome c3 gave a rhombic spectrum with apparent g values at gmax  2.95, gmid  2.29 and gmin  1.54 and 1.43, consistent with lowspin Fe(III)-heme groups with bis-histidinyl co-ordination. Furthermore, a broad peak at gmax  3.29 was detected. Because, in bis-histidinyl-co-ordinated porphyrins the g-tensor anisotropy increases with the angle between the normal vectors of the imidazole planes [30], the latter gmax value may be attributed to a heme iron center in which the axial imidazole planes are maintained approximately perpendicular to each other. In the case of spectra with strong gmax features, only gz can be observed, gx and gy usually being too broad to be resolved [31]. This type of heme center is found in heme II of cytochrome c3. The spectrum of cytochrome c3 from four individual species (Table 1) was simulated using the model of Griffith [32], which has been shown to be a good approximation for low-spin heme components [33]. No dipolar interactions between the heme centers in the all Fe(III) state were assumed, as described by Bertrand et al. [34] and More et al. [35].

optical index [(A552,red 2 A570,red)/A280,ox] [14], which was found to be 3.6. This value is the highest obtained for any cytochrome c3 isolated so far. Optical spectra The UV/visible spectrum exhibited a Soret peak at 409 nm in the oxidized form and absorption peaks at 552 nm, 523.4 nm and 418.6 nm in the sodium dithionite-reduced form with an absorption coefficient of the a-peak (552 nm, reduced) of 120 ^ 1 mm21´cm21. Interaction with hydrogenase Cytochrome c3 was reduced by dihydrogen in the presence of [NiFe] hydrogenase with a maximum rate of 790 ^ 30 nmol´min21´(nmol hydrogenase)21 compared with 660 ^ 20 nmol´min21´(nmol hydrogenase)21 for the nonaheme cytochrome c, all three proteins coming from D. desulfuricans Essex.

Primary structure The protein is composed of 107 amino-acid residues and four heme-binding motifs, two of the Cys-X1-X2-Cys-His type and two with a four-residue separation between the heme-attaching cysteines (Fig. 2). MALDI-MS analysis of cytochrome c3 gave a molecular mass of 14 070 ^ 1 Da [36], in excellent agreement with the molecular mass of 14 073 Da derived from the amino-acid sequence including four heme groups. A remarkably high content of lysine residues (16 residues) in comparison with a low content of glutamic acid (seven residues) and aspartic acid (five residues) was found, being responsible for the pI of 8.5 of cytochrome c3 from D. desulfuricans Essex 6 [17], and making the protein a member of the basic group of cytochromes c3 [37]. The sequence identity between cytochromes c3 from the D. desulfuricans strains Essex 6 and ATCC 27774 is 84%, differing in 16 residues, whereas the sequence identity with other cytochromes c3 (Fig. 2) does not exceed 44%. Strictly conserved amino acids besides four heme-binding motifs found within all the cytochromes c3 of the Desulfovibrio species are a phenylalanine residue in the vicinity of two heme-co-ordinating histidines, Phe20-X1His22-X2-X3-His25, a histidine (His35), a valine (Val18) and one glycine located in the binding motif of heme II (Gly50). It has been suggested that the conserved Phe20 plays a key role in electron transfer between hemes I and III [38], but recent mutational studies indicate only a minor effect on the redox properties if this residue is replaced [39,40].

Structural analysis A summary of data collection and refinement statistics is shown in Table 2. The overall structure of cytochrome c3 (Fig. 3) bears four covalently attached heme groups numbered according to the position of their binding motifs in the protein sequence. The protein fold consists of two b-strands (Leu9±Lys12; Tyr17±Phe20), four a-helices (Cys30±Cys33; Leu64±His69; Cys79±Gly89; Pro91± Thr98), one short 310 helix (Ala23±His25) and a high number of b turns forming a compact globular structure, Ê with an overall size of < 36 Â 35 Â 25 A. All residues fall within acceptable regions in a Ramachandran plot, except Cys51 (F  21008; C  21208), which is used for the covalent attachment of heme II. The same conformation has been reported for the homologous cysteine in other cytochromes c3 from sulfate-reducing bacteria [13]. The protein surface has a positive electrostatic surface potential, predominantly in a patch surrounding heme IV. The solvent accessibility of the heme groups is high, with relative values ranging from 7.1% for heme IV to 21.6% for

heme III. At least one side of each porphyrin ring is exposed to the solvent: pyrrole rings A and B in heme I and IV, A, C and D in heme II, and in heme III the propionate groups (A, D) point towards the surface. The propionate groups of hemes I, II and IV form tight hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with surrounding residues, whereas the propionates of heme III are co-ordinated by solvent molecules. Heme groups I and IV and, to some extent, II and III constitute two roughly coplanar pairs which are oriented almost perpendicular to each other. The largest iron±iron distances from the other hemes were observed between Ê hemes I and IV (17.5 A), and the shortest ones between Ê hemes I and III (11.1 A) (Table 3). The iron atoms of the heme in the sequence II±I±III±IV cover a distance of Ê less than 12 A, and the corresponding porphyrin plane Ê edges are separated by about 6 A from each other with nearly orthogonal interplanar angles, ranging from 828 to 988. Thus the four hemes have been described as a folded chain of hemes in two-by-two contacts rather than as an actual four-heme cluster [9,13]. All of the porphyrin systems are linked covalently to the protein chain via two thioether bonds to cysteine residues. Hemes I and III utilize the classical binding motif, CysN-X1-X2-CysC-His, whereas hemes II and IV have a CysN-X1-X2-X3-X4-CysC-His binding sequence in which CysN is bound to the vinyl group of pyrrole B and CysC to the vinyl group of pyrrole C. The classical heme-binding motifs for heme I and III form an a helical structure, in

contrast with the nonclassical types, which show a b turn structure (Cys46±Cys51, Cys101±Cys106). The four heme groups in cytochrome c3 show characteristic differences which influence their chemical and electrochemical properties, and, of these, the distortions of the heme planes are most striking. On the basis of molecular-mechanics calculations and normal-co-ordinate structural decomposition of solution resonance Raman spectra, it has been suggested that the observed puckering of heme groups is mainly determined by the part of the protein sequence between the two cysteines plus the proximal histidine that also makes up the heme-binding motif for the respective heme group [41]. The nonclassical heme-binding motifs of hemes II and IV cause a greater distortion of the heme planes, and this was suggested to be the main determinant of potential heme redox fine tuning by the protein [41]. To a lesser degree, the relative orientations of the histidine residues that form the fifth and sixth ligands in all of the heme groups are also thought to influence the redox potential. The ligand geometry of the four heme groups corresponds exactly to that observed in the structure of cytochrome c3 from D. desulfuricans ATCC27774 [11]. The orientation of the histidine residues is nearly coplanar in hemes I and IV and only slightly distorted in heme III, whereas they form an angle of 678 in heme II. The orientation of the imidazole planes towards the heme plane

varies in the same way among the four heme groups. In hemes I, II and IV, the plane of the fifth ligand is oriented almost parallel to pyrroles A and B of the porphyrin group, while in heme III the imidazole plane is twisted about 808 with respect to pyrroles A and B. The remarkable variations in orientation of the histidine ligands of the heme groups may be due to hydrogen bonds to Nd1. Nd1 of the histidines of hemes II and III shows tight hydrogen bonding to the protein chain and, in a likewise manner, deviations from coplanarity of the histidine plane normals. The pattern of bound water molecules to the histidines of heme I (His34 and His22) was also observed in Desulfomicrobium norvegicum and Desulfomicrobium vulgaris Miyazaki [13]. Several aromatic residues are found in the vicinity of and almost parallel to the histidines of the heme groups. His76 also forms a hydrogen bond between N:2 and the propionate Ê (O1D) of pyrrole D of heme II (bond distance 2.86 A), which may also add to the ruffling of this heme. The highly conserved Phe20 mentioned above is found between hemes I and III. It is almost coplanar to His25 of heme I, and a well-defined water molecule could serve as a pathway to His22 on heme III [forming a hydrogen bridge linking the Ê carbonyl group of Phe20 (bond distance 2.99 A) to Nd1 of Ê His22 (bond distance 2.82 A) which co-ordinates heme III]. Figure 4 shows the connection between hemes I and II by two consecutive histidine residues, His34 and 35. The

DISCUSSION
Despite the rather low homology among the amino-acid sequences of c3-type cytochromes, the overall structural features of their protein backbones, i.e. two antiparallel b strands and three to five a helices, and in particular their general heme arrangement are found to be highly conserved among all 3D structures determined to date [13]. This is also reflected in the Ramachandran plot, in which Cys51 is the only nonglycine residue found in a forbidden region of the plot in any cytochrome c3 structure. It seems that the exact conservation of the heme arrangement is of great importance for the intermolecular electron-transport pathway. Cytochrome c3 from D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774 is highly homologous to the cytochrome c3 presented in this report. Its amino-acid composition differs in 16 residues, as shown in Fig. 2. The crystal structure of this cytochrome c3, crystallized in space group P6122, has been solved at Ê Ê 1.75 A [11], and was later refined to 1.60 A resolution [42]. The rmsd of the Ca atoms between the structures of cytochrome c3 from the strains Essex 6 and ATCC 27774 is Ê 0.66 A. Despite the high homology between the two proteins, superimposition shows a slight displacement of Ê heme I by 0.6 A, whereas the other three hemes superimpose perfectly within the given resolution of the two structures. This displacement coincides with a shift of the terminal part in D. desulfuricans Essex with respect to D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774. Both these residues face into the core of the protein and may cause the slight displacement of the N-terminal region. There is no indication so far that this feature leads to any change in the properties of cytochrome c3 from D. desulfuricans Essex, and neither residue is conserved in other cytochrome c3 sequences. Thus, comparison of structures from closely related bacterial strains can provide valuable information about the tolerance of the observed hemepacking motifs towards variations and modifications, especially when recombinant proteins are not easily available. Electron transfer to and within cytochrome c3 has been the subject of kinetic and mutational studies. According to these, the entry point for an electron from hydrogenase is heme IV, and hemes I and III seem to be in competition with each other for reoxidation of heme IV [9,11,43]. A second model, based on proton-NMR redox titrations, postulated heme II as the most likely entry point for electrons [44]. Together with other lines of evidence, such as the puckering of heme planes and the variation in hemebinding motifs, both of these proposals underline a differentiation between hemes I and III on one side and hemes II and IV on the other. Very recently, molecular modelling studies on the interaction between the [NiFe] hydrogenase and cytochrome c3 from D. desulfuricans ATCC 27774 have been reported [43]. The lowest energydocking solutions were found to correspond to an interaction between the heme IV region in cytochrome c3 with the distal [4Fe-4S] cluster of the hydrogenase. Note that other docking solutions have been found that may be relevant to proton-linked electron transfer.

While the arrangement of the four hemes in cytochrome c3 is unique to this family of proteins, although it has been found to occur in several copies, such as in the nonaheme cytochromes c [17,18,45], the packing motif formed by the subset made up of hemes I and III is widely spread among various types of multiheme c cytochromes. It occurs in enzymes such as hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (hemes II/III, V/VI, VII/VIII [46]), cytochrome c nitrite reductase (hemes II/III and IV/V [47]), and flavocytochrome c fumarate reductase (hemes III/IV [48]), but also in electron carriers, such as cytochrome c554 (hemes III/IV [49]), and the nonaheme cytochrome c. The protein environment around these heme groups is hardly conserved at all, and even features such as the phenylalanine residue between the two hemes (Phe20) are absent in some cases, and yet their relative arrangement remains highly similar. Although the issue is still a matter of debate, cytochrome c3 is supposed to serve as a carrier for only one or two electrons rather than four, as the number of hemes may suggest [43,44]. Considering all the findings listed above, this leads to the assumption that hemes I and III form the same conserved `di-heme elbow motif' that is found in other multiheme cytochromes c and that the special properties of this arrangement are the key feature of this protein [16]. With the positively charged surface patch surrounding it, and according to experimental evidence, heme IV may be the entry point for electrons, which are then directed to hemes I and III.
