Ankyrin repeat (AR) proteins mediate innumerable protein­protein interactions in virtually all phyla. This finding suggested the use of AR proteins as designed binding molecules. Based on sequence and structural analyses, we designed a consensus AR with fixed framework and randomized interacting residues. We generated several combinatorial libraries of AR proteins consisting of defined numbers of this repeat. Randomly chosen library members are expressed in soluble form in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli constituting up to 30% of total cellular protein and show high thermodynamic stability. We determined the crystal structure of one of those library members to 2.0-Å resolution, providing insight into the consensus AR fold. Besides the highly complementary hydrophobic repeat­repeat interfaces and the absence of structural irregularities in the consensus AR protein, the regular and extended hydrogen bond networks in the -turn and loop regions are noteworthy. Furthermore, all residues found in the turn region of the Ramachandran plot are glycines. Many of these features also occur in natural AR proteins, but not in this rigorous and standardized fashion. We conclude that the AR domain fold is an intrinsically very stable and well-expressed scaffold, able to display randomized interacting residues. This scaffold represents an excellent basis for the design of novel binding molecules.

reflects protein stability (9), although selection for function will introduce a bias. The collection of nearly 8,000 AR sequences in the SMART database (10) facilitates such an approach. This consensus design concept has been used to generate enzymes with improved thermostability (11, 12) and to improve antibody stability (9, 13, 14). We used this concept to design a consensus AR consisting of fixed framework residues that are responsible for repeat structure maintenance (fold conservation) and of randomized interacting residues, i.e., residues, which, in a repeat domain, create a randomized surface for interaction with target proteins. Varying numbers of this repeat were assembled between capping repeats (caps), yielding combinatorial libraries of consensus AR proteins (H.K.B., M.T.S., P.F., Patrick Amstutz, and A.P., unpublished work). Here, we show that the library design based on consensus sequences works for ARs. We analyzed the stability of six randomly chosen library members consisting of four to six repeats. Four of these proteins were screened for crystallization. With the help of the resulting 2.0-Å crystal structure of a five-repeat consensus protein, we examined differences to natural AR proteins and present structural insights into the success of the AR domain fold. Materials and Methods
Protein Expression, Purification, and Characterization. The detailed description of the design, expression, and purification of the consensus AR proteins will be presented elsewhere (see also patent application PCT EP01 10454). The protein sequences have been deposited in GenBank and are listed in Fig. 5, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site, www.pnas.org. Throughout this article, subscript indices will be used to describe consensus repeat positions (e.g., Gly27) whereas normal indices denote residues in the protein sequence (e.g., Met-34). In addition, X will denote any amino acid except C, G, or P, whereas Z will indicate any of the amino acids H, N, or Y. The limitations to the indicated amino acids were possible by using mixed trinucleotides as a building block for oligonucleotide synthesis (15). Briefly, AR protein libraries were assembled joining an N-terminal cap, two to four designed internal ARs (consensus repeat), and a C-terminal cap (N2C, N3C and N4C libraries). The N-terminal cap sequence is (including a His tag): MRGSHHHHHH GSDLGKKLLE AARAGQDDEV RILMANGADV NAX, where Asp-13 is the first residue of the cap and where the last X corresponds to a consensus repeat position 33. The internal repeat sequences are based on the following designed consensus sequence: D1X2X3G4X5T6P7L8H9

he importance of ankyrin repeat (AR) proteins in nature is underlined by their abundance in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals (1). There are nuclear (e.g., I B ), cytosolic (e.g., ankyrin), membrane-bound (e.g., notch), and secreted (e.g., black widow spider toxin) AR proteins. The function of AR domains is to mediate protein­protein interactions. They are built from tightly joined repeats of usually 33 aa. Each repeat forms a structural unit, which consists of a -turn, followed by two antiparallel -helices and a loop reaching the turn of the next repeat (2, 3). Up to 29 consecutive repeats can be found in a single protein (4). Yet, AR domains usually consist of four to six repeats, which stack onto each other, leading to a right-handed solenoid structure with a continuous hydrophobic core and a large solvent-accessible surface (5). AR proteins fulfill their diverse biological functions by specific and tight binding to target polypeptides, and each repeat can contribute to target binding (3). Target affinities in the low nanomolar range have been reported (6, 7). The evolutionary success of members of this protein family originates from their ability to bind to virtually any target protein by simple adaptation of their molecular surface and by displaying highly variable residues throughout the protein. The modularity of AR domains enables surface evolution by allowing duplications and deletions of repeats and shuffling of repeats between repeat domains (5, 8). Hence, the AR domain fold is a very versatile scaffold for the evolutionary generation of protein domains displaying specific binding surfaces. These characteristics motivated us to exploit AR domains as a scaffold for the construction of libraries of novel binding molecules. We started the library construction with the assumption that all ARs belong to a canonical ensemble, which can be described by the consensus sequence and its statistics of variation. In a first approximation, the distribution of amino acids at a given position can be described by Boltzmann's law, because this distribution

The C-terminal cap sequence is: QDKFGKTAFD ISIDNGNEDL AEILQ, where the first Gln corresponds to consensus repeat position X33 of the preceding repeat. In the present study, six randomly chosen full-length library members, two each from the N2C (E2 5 and E2 17), N3C (E3 5 and E3 19), and N4C (E4 2 and E4 8) libraries, were expressed and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography to virtual homogeneity. Proteins were used at 2 mg ml in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl for dynamic light scattering measurements by using a ProteinSolutions DynaPro MS X instrument at 20°C with the software DYNAMICS 4.0. Equilibrium unfolding of 10 M protein in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and variable concentrations of guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) was followed at 222 nm by CD with a Jasco (Tokyo) J-715 instrument. Samples were equilibrated overnight and measured at 23°C in duplicates. Data were evaluated by fitting to a two-state unfolding model where appropriate (16). The assumption of two-state unfolding is, however, preliminary and fluorescence measurements as a complementary method to monitor the equilibrium unfolding were not conclusive because of the lack of buried fluorophors.
Crystallization and Data Collection. Proteins were rebuffered in 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and concentrated to 9 mg ml. E3 5 was crystallized by using the hanging or sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20°C, in 24-well crystallization plates. The drops contained 2 l of protein and 2 l of reservoir solution (16­22% PEG 4000, 0.2 M Li2SO4, and 0.1 M NH4OAc, pH 4.6­5.0), with 0.5 ml of reservoir buffer in each well. The crystals grew in 1­2 weeks from precipitated protein. For cryoprotection, crystals were soaked for 30 sec in reservoir solution containing additional PEG 4000 (final concentration 40%), before flash-freezing them at 110 K for data collection. X-ray diffraction analysis was performed by using CuK radiation generated by a Nonius FR 591 rotating anode generator (Nonius, Delft, The Netherlands) equipped with a doublefocusing mirror system (XRM-216; Prophysics, Zurich). Data were recorded on an imaging plate detector (300 mm; Mar Research, Norderstedt, Germany) with a detector to crystal distance of 90 mm. Under these conditions crystals were stable and diffracted x-rays to 2.0-Å resolution. A data set from a single crystal (85 85 850 m) was collected and processed with the DENZO and SCALEPACK (17) crystallographic data reduction package. The crystal belonged to space group P21212 and the Matthews coefficient of VM 2.3 Å3 Da was calculated by using the molecular mass of 17.7 kDa, which corresponds to an estimated water content of 46.1%. Statistics on data collection are given in Table 1. In addition, crystals of two different space groups (indexed P21 and R3) were found and data were collected. However, higher diffraction limits suggested the use of the P21212 data set for the structure determination.

A thorough analysis of the consensus AR protein structure and several other AR protein structures, [Protein Data Bank ID codes: 1A5E (24), 1AWC (19), 1BD8 (25), 1DCQ (26), 1IHB (27), 1K1A (28), 1MYO (29), 1NFI (30), 1SW6 (31), and 1YCS (2)], was carried out by using the following programs: HBPLUS (32) and LIGPLOT (33) for analysis of the H-bonding networks and the hydrophobic contacts; GRASP (34) for surface calculations and cavity search; SWISS PDB-VIEWER (35) and INSIGHT II (Accelrys, Cambridge, U.K.) for model dissection, superposition and rms deviation (rmsd) calculations; the PRIDE server (36) for determining the evolutionary relation, and TREEVIEW (37) for visualizing this relation. For the analysis, the different AR protein structures were split into single repeats. Splitting was done on a visual basis at the start of the -turn, which corresponds to position D1 of the consensus sequence proposed by Sedgwick and Smerdon (3). Results and Discussion We designed a consensus AR consisting of fixed framework residues and randomized interacting residues based on sequence and structure analyses. Varying numbers of this AR were cloned between N- and C-terminal caps, i.e., ARs that shield the hydrophobic core of the AR domain from the solvent. This process resulted in designed AR protein libraries of distinct repeat numbers (N2C, N3C, and N4C representing four-, five-, and six-repeat proteins, respectively; N and C denote the caps and digits denote the number of consensus repeats). All randomly chosen full-length library members analyzed so far ( 20) could be expressed in soluble form in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli to 10­30% of total cellular protein (up to 200 mg protein per liter shake flask culture) and did not aggregate in standard buffers (20­50 mM Tris Cl, pH 7­8.5 50­500 mM NaCl). N2C (E2 5, E2 17), N3C (E3 5, E3 19), and N4C (E4 2, E4 8) AR protein libraries were analyzed in more detail. The GdmCl equilibrium unfolding of these four-, five-, and six-repeat proteins was measured by CD (Fig. 1). These designed AR proteins

All nonidentical residues in the search model were replaced by Ala. A conventional AMORE protocol (rotation, translation, rigid body refinement) was applied and yielded a single clear solution. Model building was carried out by using the program O (20). The structure was refined in CNS (21), followed by REFMAC (22), resulting in a final model with an R factor of 18.4% and an Rfree factor of 23.0%.

Overall Structure. The crystals of the consensus AR protein E3 5 were analyzed, a complete data set was collected, and the structure was determined as described in Materials and Methods. A 2.0-Å resolution structure of E3 5 was obtained. The B factors are generally low and do not vary much, which can be taken as an indication for very little thermal movement and therefore a rigid structure of the protein in the crystal. E3 5 shows a very regular and ordered AR domain fold, and the structure is highly 0.9 Å) to mouse GABP 1 [69.7% homologous (rmsdC sequence identity (19)].

show cooperative, reversible unfolding with midpoints of unfolding between 2.9 and 5 M GdmCl and possess values for the free energy of unfolding ( G) between 9.5 and 21 kcal mol, assuming two-state unfolding (16) (Table 2). Even though all proteins are very stable, their variable residues (10­14% of total residues) do have an influence on stability when comparing proteins of the same length. Therefore, a definite statement relating the number of ARs to biophysical properties has to await AR proteins with identical repeats. To date, the equilibrium unfolding data of four natural AR proteins have been reported. These are myotrophin (N2C), with G 5.1 kcal mol (38); the INK4 family members p16 (N2C), with G 3.1 kcal mol (39) and p19 (N3C), where no two-state unfolding was observed (40) and notch (N5C), with G 8 kcal mol (41). The thermodynamic stability of our consensus repeat proteins is thus clearly higher than that of the reported natural AR proteins. This finding underlines the success of the consensus design strategy and demonstrates the intrinsic high stability of the AR domain fold. In addition, our consensus AR domains tolerate many variable surface residues, emphasizing their potential as novel binding molecules.
Crystallization. We performed crystallization trials with four immobilized metal affinity chromatography-purified consensus AR proteins (E2 5, E3 5, E3 19, and E4 2). Dynamic light scattering experiments showed monodisperse behavior for E2 5, E3 5, and E3 19, which is advantageous for crystallization (42). Table 2.

sensus repeats show essentially no backbone deviation between each other (rmsdC 2­3: 0.52 Å; 2­4: 0.37 Å; 3­4: 0.49 Å). Most consensus amino acids fulfill their assigned functions, and residues of the hydrophobic core and some exposed residues are identical throughout the molecule on the rotamer level (consensus positions: Asp1, Thr6, Pro7, Leu8, His9, Leu10, His16, Leu17, Ile19, Val20, Glu21, Leu23, Leu24, Asp29, Val30, and Asn31; see Materials and Methods and Fig. 2C for consensus sequence and numbering). These are framework residues forming the repeat scaffold. All glycines and alanines in framework positions are also superimposable. Other residues are less similar on the rotamer level, such as all randomized positions (X2, X3, X5, X13, X14, and X33) but also the framework positions Glu18, Val22, and Lys25. This finding indicates that other residues may also be allowed in these framework positions. The residues at framework position Z26 have a hydrophobic stem and a polar end with rotamers showing similar orientations. Interestingly, very similar overall findings are obtained for the internal repeats of GABP 1 (19). However, in this molecule not only side chains corresponding to the consensus positions 18, 22, and 25 adopt variable rotamers, but also those corresponding to positions 10, 17, and 21. This may be because of the presence of different amino acids at these positions. The amino acids in positions corresponding to consensus positions 19, 20, 26, 29, 30, and 31 vary in GABP 1, but still adopt similar conformations as in E3 5. H-bonding is very regular in E3 5. In GABP 1, however, the second repeat contains fewer H-bonds (27 H-bonds) than the consensus repeat (31 H-bonds; Fig. 3).
Caps. We used the terminal repeats of GABP 1 (19) as the starting point for the engineering of our caps, because GABP 1 was most homologous to our consensus repeats. We adapted the caps of GABP 1 in the loop (N-terminal cap) and the -turn (C-terminal cap) regions to fit the consensus repeats and we replaced cysteines to prevent dimerization on oxidation. The designed caps of E3 5 are therefore highly homologous ( 90% sequence identity) to the terminal repeats of GABP 1. Nevertheless, the designed loop region of the N-terminal cap shows, as expected, significant differences to GABP 1, affecting the entire cap structure. The implemented consensus loop (GADVNA) is more densely packed (causing Met-34 to rotate to fill the altered hydrophobic core), contains more H-bonds and is more polar than the corresponding loop (GAPFT) of GABP 1. The C-terminal cap of E3 5 is slightly more compact compared with GABP 1. The change of the -turn from SKFC (GABP 1) to DKFG (E3 5) had no impact on the structure and H-bonds. In GABP 1, an atypical AR H-bond of Asn-149 to Asn-115 is observed, whereas in E3 5, Asn-158 makes a ``consensus-like'' H-bond to Ala-121. Overall, the designed caps shield the conKohl et al.

-Turn. Fig. 3A shows the -turns with their hydrogen bonding network. Five intrarepeat H-bonds per -turn involve (i) three side-chain main-chain interactions from the carboxyl Asp1O to X3, Gly4, and X5, (ii) a Asp1NH-Gly4O backbone­backbone H-bond, and (iii) a Asp1NH-X5O backbone­backbone H-bond. One interrepeat H-bond is formed from X3O to X2NH of the neighboring repeat. This arrangement leads to a continuous, regular array of the -turns including five intrarepeat and one interrepeat H-bonds per -turn (Fig. 3A). Natural AR proteins with known structures do not possess such a regular arrangement of the -turns, which is also manifested in a lower number of H-bonds present (24, 29). An increased number of H-bonds is one of the few factors that seems to correlate with increased thermostability in all protein families (43).

the His9 side chain. Thereby, the His9 side chain is in a conformation that allows the formation of one or two H-bonds toward X33 of the same or X5 of the next repeat. The high conservation of this motif in natural AR proteins underlines the importance of this interrepeat H-bond network, propagating over the entire molecule. regions (2, 28, 30, 44). Even an additional helix may be present. Such irregularities were eliminated by our consensus design. The GADVNAX loop connecting helix 2 with the -turn of the next repeat is very regular in E3 5 (rmsdC 0.25 Å). Gly27 breaks out of helix 2. Ala28 and especially Val30 are hydrophobic anchors of the loop, whereas Asp29 and Asn31 are involved in H-bonding to the neighboring repeat loops. The GHLE loop connecting the two helices in a repeat is structurally conserved in E3 5 (rmsdC 0.2 Å). It establishes several main-chain main-chain H-bonds with helix 1 of the same repeat. The design further anticipated a side-chain main-chain H-bond from His16 to the X13 of the previous repeat. This H-bond is seen in repeats two and four, but not in repeat three, which may be caused by the reorientation of the His-92 side-chain to form a H-bond with Thr-90. Again, the strict conservation of the loops may be stabilizing the consensus repeats compared with less conserved natural repeats, as the H-bonding pattern is more pronounced.

the normal range ( 3.9 Å). This results in two rows of packed helices perpendicular to the orientation of the repeats. The main hydrophobic contacts are thus formed in an interrepeat rather than in an intrarepeat manner (3). A careful comparison of the hydrophobic core packaging of E3 5 with that of natural AR proteins of known structures did not reveal any significant differences. In general, cavities are present in AR proteins including E3 5, but are rather small ( 30 Å3). The interrepeat contacts in E3 5 and known natural AR protein structures are mostly of hydrophobic nature. A typical contact area between two repeats is formed by four to five H-bonds, 80­100 atoms, which potentially contribute to the hydrophobic contact (cut-off 3.9 Å), and comprises 1,100­1,700 Å2 of buried surface. The contact area is a substantial part of the hydrophobic core, but shows some analogies to typical protein­ protein interaction surfaces, which are characterized by a sizeequivalent surface but more H-bonds [protein­protein interaction: 1,600 400 Å2, 9 5 H-bonds (47)]. The covalent linkage between two repeats certainly increases the interface stability. Still, the few interrepeat H-bonds (e.g., the H-bonds in the TPLH motif, between the -turns and in the loop regions), which are conserved throughout the structures and are part of our consensus sequence, may help in the proper orientation of the repeats during assembly and may also be a stabilizing factor (2).
Fig. 4. PRIDE (36) analysis of single AR. The analysis divides the repeats into four branches, which are shown as groups. The repeats, including terminal repeats, were numbered according to their occurrence in the full-length proteins. This number is given directly after the appropriate Protein Data Bank identifier. The respective superpositions of the repeats are shown next to the four groups.

consensus AR proteins, we dissected published repeat structures and analyzed them concerning irregularities, interrepeat and intrarepeat H-bonds, hydrophobic contacts, buried surface area, cavities, and rmsdc . In addition, we subjected all suitable repeats (minimal length 30 aa) to a PRIDE cross comparison (36). The PRIDE server divides the ARs mainly into four groups (Fig. 4). Group A is by far the largest and most conserved group and encloses the regular ARs. In this group all internal repeats of E3 5 as well as the internal repeats of 1AWC, 1K1A, 1IHB, 1YCS, and 1NFI can be found. A typical repeat in this group was found to have 30 H-bonds, ranging from 17 (1A5E3) to 34 (1DCQ3). The internal repeats of E3 5 are found to have on average 31 H-bonds. The rmsdC in this group is well below 1.0 Å (usually 0.5 Å). A second group (B) includes mostly Nterminal caps, which are structurally more distant to the consensus repeat, lacking the -turn or having irregular loop regions. In a third group (C), irregular repeats and the repeats of 1MYO were grouped, which can be explained by their locally different architecture in the -turn and in the repeat-connecting loop region, leading to a high rmsdC , 3 Å. The fourth group (D) consists only of the second repeat of INK4 family proteins, which have a shortened first -helix, leading to an elongated loop between the helices (24­27). These irregular repeats form only 22 H-bonds and destabilize the overall structure of the INK4 proteins (45). Nevertheless, they are of biological importance, as they are part of the INK4 CDK interaction interface. In AR domains the two helices of a single repeat do not pack closely together to form a single tight hydrophobic core. Using a cut-off of 3.9 Å for hydrophobic contacts, HBPLUS showed often none or only a few hydrophobic contacts within a single AR. Most of the hydrophobic contacts between the two antiparallel helices range from 4.0 to 4.5 Å. These values are rather high but are still in agreement with the general CH3­CH3 group van der Waals distances, known for proteins (46). In contrast to the weak intrarepeat hydrophobic contacts the interrepeat contacts are in

Cooperativity. The crystal structure of E3 5 enabled us to rationalize the basis of its cooperative unfolding (Fig. 1; Table 2). The hydrophobic core and the H-bond networks in the -turn region, the TPLHLAA motif, and the GADVNA loop motif are features that extend throughout the entire molecule. Thus, these features lead to mutual stabilization of stacked repeats and thus to cooperative unfolding of the assembly. The weak hydrophobic intrarepeat contacts suggest that a single AR is not stable (2). In contrast, interrepeat contacts are stronger, suggesting that individual repeats are stabilized by their neighbors and thus stability and cooperativity increase as the number of repeats increases. Such a behavior has been reported for p16, where the minimal folding unit was determined to consist of two repeats (45). The increased stability and cooperativity of E4 8 (Table 2) also supports this reasoning. Nevertheless, this observation needs more detailed analysis with perfectly repetitive AR proteins.

(left-handed -helical region) of the Ramachandran plot of, e.g., GABP 1 (19) mostly Gly but also other amino acids such as Asp-71, Lys-104, Asn-115, and Cys-137 are found. In E3 5, however, all amino acids found in the turn region are Gly. Gly to Ala mutations, where both residues retain the conformation and are in the turn region, can destabilize a protein by as much as 1.9 kcal mol (48). Mutations from Gly to Ala not constrained to the turn region are in general stabilizing ( 1 kcal mol) because of an increase in the entropy of unfolding (49). The replacement of non-Gly residues found in the turn region by Gly may thus be a stabilizing feature of the consensus AR proteins. At neutral pH, E3 5 has many conserved surface exposed charges, which are well separated and occur as ``belts'' on the surface formed by several repeats. Hydrophobic surface patches are less pronounced in comparison to known structures of natural AR proteins. In turn, this might render E3 5 more soluble and less prone to aggregation. has previously been used to create molecules with improved stabilities (9, 11­14). We have successfully applied this consensus design to ARs. We showed that consensus AR proteins are well expressed and possess a high thermodynamic stability. This high stability of the AR protein framework may rationalize the

widespread occurrence of AR proteins. With the help of a 2.0-Å crystal structure of such a consensus AR protein, we were able to pinpoint stability-determining aspects. The absence of irregularities leading to refined intrarepeat and interrepeat interactions seems to be important. Especially the improved mutual stabilization of neighboring repeats seems to be beneficial (extended H-bonding networks, continuous hydrophobic core). Furthermore, only glycines are found in the turn region of the Ramachandran plot. Although many of these features occur in natural AR proteins as well, they are not present in this rigorous and standardized fashion as implemented in the designed molecules. As we have well-behaved AR proteins in hand consisting of different repeat numbers with randomized surfaces, we can probe these molecules for binding against target proteins. Indeed, libraries of N2C and N3C AR proteins were selected by using ribosome display (50) against several globular proteins, and specific binding molecules with affinities in the low nanomolar range were isolated (H.K.B., P.

A.P., unpublished work). The intrinsic stability, the polar surface, and the selectable binding properties of our designed AR proteins suggest that these molecules could also assist crystallization of difficult targets in analogy to antibody cocrystallization (51).
Note: While we revised the present manuscript, Mosavi et al. (52) published the crystal structures of two AR proteins consisting of three or four full consensus repeats. Although the two approaches have differences (protein libraries vs. full consensus proteins, different consensus sequences, caps in our molecules, different solution behavior, different number of repeats) the structural and stability findings are similar. Thus the two studies complement each other. We thank Dr. Guido Capitani, Christophe Briand, Daniel Frey, and Patrick Amstutz for valuable discussions and the referees for valuable comments.
