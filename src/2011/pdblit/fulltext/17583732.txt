Abstract--An ATP-bmdlng protein was purified from pig cerebral cortex Extraction of a crude membrane fraction with dlstdled water, &fferentml acetone fractlonatlon and sequentml column chromatography on Sephadex G 200, DEAE-Sephacel and an ATP-affimty Sepharose led to a 310-fold purification ATPase, phospho&esterase, adenylate cyclase and protein klnase were separated during the preparation ATP-bmdmg was stu&ed by a filtration techmque Specific binding of ATP exhibited a blphaslc time course and was pH and temperature dependent. Scatchard plots of eqmhbrxum binding data were nonhnear suggesting the exastence of two &fferent binding sites for ATP The &ssocmtlon constants (Kd) were 4 1 × 10- 8 and 2 0 x 10- ~ M and the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) 0.68 and 1 0 nmol ATP bound per mg of purified protein Several related compounds were stu&ed for their abdlty to inhibit ATP-blndmg Only ADP, GTP and CTP, but not adenosine, AMP, cychc AMP and cychc GMP, were potent in displacing ATP from its binding sites Speofic binding of ATP was strictly dependent on the presence of &valent cations, Mg z+, Mn 2+ and Ca 2+ being eqmpotent

INTRODUCTION ATP plays a central role m all hvlng matter. First, it xs by far the most important lntracellular energy transducer and second, it displays a number of important regulatory properties for several enzymes, e.g. in the citric acid cycle and m glycolysls A third slgmficant function for A T P is being &scussed m neurotransmission (Stone, 1980). Work c a m e d out m several laboratories during the last decade is pointing to the posslblhty that ATP, other adenine nucleotides and adenosine may act as purmerglc transmitter substances (Boyd, 1976, Burnstock, 1979; Pull and McIlwam, 1972). GTP, another purlne nucleotlde, has been shown to play an important role m couphng various membrane receptors with adenylate cyclase, and to effect binding of hormones to their respectwe receptors (Pfeuffer, 1977; Llmblrd and Letkowltz, 1978). Both purlne nucleotides have been found to influence electrical properties of nervous cells (Dunwld&e and Hoffer, 1980; Kuroda and Kobayashx, 1975; Phflhs, Edstrom, Kostopoulos and K~rkpatrick, 1979; Slggms, Gruol, Padjen and Forman, 1977). A number of papers have appeared in recent years describing some properties of purmerglc receptors *Correspondence to: Dr J E Schultz, Pharmazeutxsches Institut der Umverslt~tt, Morgenstelle 8, 7400 Ttibmgen, Federal Repubhc of Germany 245
NCI 3t3-4--E

(Burnstock, 1976, 1979; Shimlzu, 1979), yet, so far only one attempt has been reported to characterize an adenosine receptor in nervous tissue by binding studies (Schwabe, Klffe, Puchstem and Trost, 1979). This technique has been used extensively for characterization of several receptors for neurotransmltters m the CNS. In this paper we report the partial purification and characterization of a membraneous protem from pig brain which brads A T P with a high speofioty and affinity. MATERIALS AND METHODS

A TP-bmdm# assay
Binding of ATP was routinely tested m a total volume of 240/~1 containing 100mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1.6 mM MgC12, 10 4 nM 3H-ATP (32 C/mmol) and various amounts of protein After 1 h at 0°C the reaction mixture was rapidly filtered through cellulose acetate filters (BA-85, Schlelcher and Schull, Dassel, W. Germany) and immediately washed with 2.5 ml of 40 mM TrIs-HC1 buffer, pH 74, 10mM MgC12, 0.1 mM EGTA The filters were dried, dissolved in a toluene based scmtdlation fired, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting Non-specific binding was assessed in parallel incubations containing either a 10,000-fold excess of unlabeled ATP or heat denatured binding protein (95°C for 5 min) Both methods gave identical results In all experiments camed out, unspecific binding was always less than 0.2pmol ATP/,ug protein representing less than 8~ of total binding All values shown m th~s report were corrected for unspecific binding

Figure 3(A) shows that 3H-ATP binding to a crude m e m b r a n e fraction of brain cortex was a hnear function of protem concentration over the range of 10-80/~g protein. The txme course of A T P - b m d m g is shown m Fig. 3(B). Binding was affected by the incubation temperature: at 12JC, equdlbrlum was reached after 10mm, and at @C after 6 0 m m The total a m o u n t of A T P bound, however, was independent of the incubation temperature. Incubation for very short time periods revealed that the b m d m g was blphaslc (Fig 3B insert). Saturation of an m m a l part of ATPbinding was reached after a b o u t 40 s Specific b m d m g was optimal at pH 7 4 (Fig 4). Evidently, binding was enhanced by phosphate buffer compared to acetate or borate buffers (Fig. 4) Bmdmg m T n s - H C I buffer at p H 7 4 was 30% less than in the correspondmg phosphate buffer (data not shown) Binding of A T P was dependent on the presence of dwalent cations At least 1 m M M g / + , M n 2 + or Ca 2 + were necessary for A T P - b m d m g .

the specificity of ATP-bmding, the effect of several related compounds was investigated. A 1000-fold excess of adenosine, AMP, cyclic AMP and cyclic G M P (10/~M), respectively, did not affect specific ATP-bmding. However, ADP and the trmucleotides GTP and CTP were potent inhibltors of ATP-bmdrag, half maximal inhibition of ATP-blndmg occurring around 1 aM concentrations (Fig. 5). The concentration dependence of ATP-bindmg to the purified binding protein was studied. At small ATP concentrations, binding saturated around 100nM, indicating the presence of high affinity binding sites At higher ATP concentrations further binding was observed. Analysis of these data by Scatchard's method (Fig. 6) yielded a non-hnear plot suggesting the existence of binding sites with clearly different affimtles for ATP The high affinity component displayed an apparent association constant (K,) of 2.4 x l0 T M-1 and a maximal number of binding sites (Bmax)of 0.68 nmol ATP bound/mg purified proteln The low affinity component exhibited an apparent K, of 4.9 x 106 M - t and a B=.x of 1.0 nmol ATP/mg purified protein, respectively. The existence of two classes of binding sites was consistent with the blphasic time course found for ATP binding (Fig. 3B). Comparisons of the ATP binding parameters of the purified preparations with those obtained with the membrane-bound activity in the starting material indicated that the affinity of ATP to both binding sites remained essentially unchanged during the preparation while the Bm,x increased. DISCUSSION We have partially purified and characterized what seems to be a remarkable ATP-binding protein from pig cerebral cortical membranes. Its membraneous

attachment is not very strong since, for its release, extraction with distilled water is sufficient ATP-bindmg can be expected from all enzymes using ATP as substrate. Usually, their Michaehs constants for ATP are in the same range as the physiological cytoplasmic ATP concentration, which is milhmolar. Therefore, an intrinsic enzymic activity for the isolated protein seems unlikely since its high affinity binding sites are completely saturated at /~M concentrations. Also, several enzymic activities which use purlne nucleotides as substrates and are known to be membrane associated could be separated from the ATP-bmdmg activity, e.g. ATPase, adenylate cyclase, cyclic nucleotide PDE and protein klnase. The latter has been suggested to represent the ATP-bmding activity which is closely related to the chohnergic receptor (Gordon et al., 1979). Also, by use of an adenylate cyclase devoid of the regulatory GTP-bindmg protein (kindly provided by Dr T. Pfeuffer, Wurzburg), it could be shown that the isolated material did not substitute for the GTP-bmdmg protein ATP-bmding is specific, rapid, reversible and saturable, and thus fulfils important criteria for the characterization of hormone and drug receptors These criteria have been used extensively in the identification and characterization of adrenerglc, dopammerglc, oplold and other receptors in various tissues In electrophyslologlcal studies ATP has been shown to depolarize neurones of amphibian sympathetic gangha, at threshold concentrations for ATP of about 10- s to
