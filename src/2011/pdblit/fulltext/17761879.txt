centimetric in size (25). Acidic environments have been suggested during sulfate formation in Meridiani Planum (11) and Valles Marineris (3). Oxide formation is observed together with sulfate precipitation in acidic environments (26, 27). Hematite and sulfate formation are observed during hydrothermal alteration of basaltic tephra under acid-sulfate conditions on Mauna Kea volcano, Hawaii (28). Alternatively, diagenesis resulting from iron-rich fluid circulation can lead to large amounts of hematite cement or concretions (25). This has been interpreted in Terra Meridiani by the Opportunity Rover Team (11), where oxide formation occurs after sulfate formation (29, 30). Sulfates are observed in Valles Marineris on outcrops several kilometers thick, much thicker than in Terra Meridiani, which could have favored sulfate transformation through diagenesis. The presence of concretions in Valles Marineris, although not necessary, would account for all the observations: oxide signature (31), resistant material, and accumulation in dark sand. The erosion of sulfate-rich outcrops would have led to the accumulation of oxide concretions at lower altitudes. Identification of spatial relationships between iron oxides and layered sulfate deposits within Valles Marineris and Margaritifer Terra, which mirror that observed at Meridiani both from orbit and in situ, is a strong indication that these minerals formed in close association, through a process that operated within a specific region of Mars. This is consistent with their origin coupled to the tectonic events following the building of Tharsis, with transient supplies of water cementing sulfates and growing concretions (3).

Replication Origin Recognition and Deformation by a Heterodimeric Archaeal Orc1 Complex
Erin L. Cunningham Dueber,1,2 Jacob E. Corn,2 Stephen D. Bell,3 James M. Berger2* The faithful duplication of genetic material depends on essential DNA replication initiation factors. Cellular initiators form higher-order assemblies on replication origins, using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to locally remodel duplex DNA and facilitate proper loading of synthetic replisomal components. To better understand initiator function, we determined the 3.4 angstrom­ resolution structure of an archaeal Cdc6/Orc1 heterodimer bound to origin DNA. The structure demonstrates that, in addition to conventional DNA binding elements, initiators use their AAA+ ATPase domains to recognize origin DNA. Together these interactions establish the polarity of initiator assembly on the origin and induce substantial distortions into origin DNA strands. Biochemical and comparative analyses indicate that AAA+/DNA contacts observed in the structure are dynamic and evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that the complex forms a core component of the basal initiation machinery. he common modular architecture of replication initiators suggests that initiator function shares a degree of mechanistic conservation across the different domains of life (1­3). All cellular initiators contain both canonical DNA binding domains and discrete adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) modules. The conventional DNA binding domains assist in localizing initiators to replication origins, whereas the ATPase elements appear to mediate the higher-order assembly of initiator subunits at the origin (4­12).

T

The particular ATPase domains used by initiators fall within the broad superfamily of AAA+ proteins, which share an ability to form large multisubunit complexes that reconfigure the structural states of specific target macromolecules (13). Precisely how initiators use the AAA+ architecture to remodel origin structure remains unclear; however, initiator complexes have been shown to load replisomal factors onto DNA (14, 15) and to facilitate origin unwinding in bacteria (5). VOL 317 SCIENCE

The archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus uses three origins of replication (oriC1, oriC2, and oriC3) (12, 16), with oriC2 containing binding sites for all three of the organism's Cdc6/Orc1 initiator paralogs (Orc1-1, Orc1-2, and Orc1-3; Fig. 1A) (17). Previous studies suggest that Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 bind during the initiation of DNA replication and that Orc1-2 may act as a negative regulator (12). Although Orc1-1 recognizes an origin DNA repeat sequence known as the origin recognition box (ORB) (11, 12), as well as a minimized version of this motif (mORB) found at oriC2, Orc1-2 and Orc1-3 each bind separate repeat sequences that are distinct from the mORB sites (termed C2 and C3, respectively). A 6­base pair (bp) overlap occurs between a mORB and a C3 site, creating a dual-site sequence jointly recognized by both Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 (Fig. 1A and fig. S1). To understand the molecular determinants by which initiators recognize and reshape origins, we cocrystallized Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 with a 33-bp DNA encompassing the mORB/C3 dual site (18). The structure was solved by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) using

S2 and table S1) (18). Both initiators demonstrate similar overall architectures, with winged-helix domains (WHDs) adjacent to, but offset from, the conventional oligomerization surfaces of the AAA+ ATPase modules (Fig. 1B and fig. S3). This configuration gives the initiators the appearance of a pair of lobster claws, which sit side by side to grip the DNA (Fig. 1, C and D). Although Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 share only a 360 Å2 interface, the juxtaposition of the two initiators creates a continuous swath of positively charged surface that binds a 28-bp stretch of DNA and buries over 2500 Å2 in the nucleoprotein interface (Fig. 1D). The WHD and the AAA+ domain of each protein contribute to DNA binding. The Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 WHDs bind in a nearly identical manner along a single face of the DNA (Figs. 1, B and C, and 2, A and B). The defining features of WHDs--the helix-turn-helix (HTH) and b-hairpin "wing" motifs--combine to create highly basic faces on the two domains (Fig. 1D), which together provide 75% of the DNA binding surface. In general, these WHDs contact DNA in a canonical fashion (displaying HTH/major groove and wing/minor groove binding), but closer inspection of these interactions reveals notable differences from established WHD binding modes. Most WHD·DNA complexes rely predominantly on one element to bind the major groove of DNA, whereas the second motif plays an auxiliary role in stabilizing the interaction (19).

These contacts play a critical role in mediating initiator/DNA associations, with HTH mutations causing 40- to 400-fold decreases in Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 target site affinities and simultaneous mutation of HTH and wing residues abolishing initiator binding (Fig. 2, A and B, and table S2) (18). The breadth of these initiator WHD·DNA interactions (originally determined by footprinting assays), in combination with the near-palindromic nature of the consensus mORB sequence, initially suggested that initiator WHDs would bind as homodimers to individual origin repeat sequences (8, 11, 12). Instead, the structure illustrates that a single WHD binds the mORB element in an asymmetric manner, despite the presence of a palindromic sequence motif. The polarity of Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 WHD binding facilitates AAA+ contacts between protomers and with origin DNA sequences 3 of the WHD-DNA interfaces. Each ATPase domain contacts the DNA using a helixloop-helix initiator-specific motif (ISM), a distinguishing feature of the initiator clade of AAA+ proteins (Figs. 1B and 2, C and D) (13). The Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 initiator insertions contribute to the positively charged AAA+ domain surfaces that bind the phosphate backbone and form additional DNA contacts via the intervening loop within the ISMs. These protein/DNA contacts are nonspecific; however, comparisons of the DNA-bound structures with DNA-free Cdc6/Orc1 structures indicate that the Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 loops undergo a conformational change upon binding to DNA (fig. S5) (8, 20). The ISMs of archaeal Cdc6/Orc1 proteins show moderate conservation, including a nearly invariant glycine within the ISM loop (Fig. 2D and fig. S6). For Orc1-3, this glycine resides at the bottom of the DNA minor groove, where it adopts a phi/psi backbone geometry that allows the neighboring isoleucine to point inward and pack into the core of the ISM. A similar arrangement is seen in the corresponding Orc1-1 glycine-leucine dipeptide sequence, except that the Orc1-1 loop passes through the major groove using a shallower trajectory. Mutations designed to disturb these loop interactions show a ~70% decrease in the overall affinity for origin DNA, and complete removal of the AAA+ domain substantially weakens initiator binding (table S2) (8, 11, 18). Remarkably, Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 achieve selective recognition of their respective target sites, including the asymmetry of intiator binding, with nominal sequence-specific interactions. Arginineguanine contacts in the Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 HTH motifs, along with asparagine-guanine and arginineadenine interactions in the Orc1-3 wing, constitute the only side-chain/base associations in the nucleoprotein interface (Fig. 2, A and B). Although we cannot rule out water-mediated base contacts at this resolution, it appears that nonspecific peptidebackbone/base and side-chain/DNA-backbone interactions form the remainder of the initiator·DNA contacts (fig. S7). Clues to this unusual and seemingly context-dependent recognition of origin sequence come from an analysis of DNA geometry, which shows that Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 both substantially unroll the double helix while preserving base pairing (Fig. 3, A and B, and fig. S8). Methidiumpropyl-EDTA (MPE) and copper phenanthroline (Cu-OP) footprinting studies (18) corroborate these distortions in vitro, with sites of initiator-dependent increases in modification propensity correlating strongly with bend points observed in the structure (fig. S1). These assays also reveal that isolated Orc1-1 binding includes the GGA sequence just 3 of the oriC2 mORB site, a region occupied by the Orc1-3 WHD in the heterodimeric complex structure. Association of Orc1-1 with this sequence (which is typically composed of guanines in full-length ORBs) (11, 12) increases chemical probe sensitivity at the site's 3 end, consistent with the idea that Orc1-1 introduces a bend in this region (fig. S1) (21). The addition of Orc1-3 appears to remodel this association, nudging the Orc1-1 AAA+ domain away from the minor groove and into the adjacent majorgroove binding conformation observed in the cocrystal structure. Together, Orc-1 and Orc1-3 induce a 20° bend in the DNA duplex at the point where their binding sites overlap (Fig. 3B). The structure of the complex thus reveals that the two initiators work individually and collectively to introduce local and global DNA deformations that substantially underwind the origin (Fig. 3, A and B). Protein/DNA interactions are quite nonspecific across the entire nucleoprotein interface, suggesting that Cdc6/Orc1 proteins rely heavily on sequence context and DNA deformability for origin recognition. In this regard, the behavior of the archaeal initiators appears to lie midway on a continuum of origin-binding mechanisms that range from the highly specific recognition of conserved sequence repeats by the bacterial DnaA initiator (22) to the complete absence of distinct origin sequences for origin recognition complex binding in metazoans (23). Using DNA malleability as a means of origin recognition could allow archaeal initiators to bind a variety of

origin sequences and may promote the melting of DNA strands required for origin unwinding. Although direct contacts between Orc1-1 and Orc1-3 are sparse, these proteins influence one another's DNA binding activities (fig. S1), indicating that initiators associate with target sites in a dynamic manner that can be modulated by other initiator subunits. In this respect, it is notable that initiators are AAA+ proteins, which typically assemble into higher-order complexes that form bipartite ATPase active sites between subunits. A key set of ATPase interactions is exemplified by DnaA (Fig. 4A), in which an arginine finger from a conserved AAA+ element (the box VII motif) inserts into the g-PO4 binding cleft of an adjacent protomer to stimulate ATP hydrolysis in trans (24). In the ADP-bound Orc1-1/Orc1-3 complex, the two initiators align on DNA in a head-to-tail arrangement similar to that seen in other AAA+ proteins, positioning the box VII helix of Orc1-3 near the active site of Orc1-1 (Fig. 4B and fig. S9). This binding of the Cdc6/Orc1 initiators to DNA appears to set up a conformation that poises the ATPase machinery to accept subunit-docking events that would lead to higher-order complex formation upon ATP activation. A particularly unexpected feature of the structure is the ability of the initiator ATPase domain to bind DNA. Phylogenetic analyses show that the ISM sequences are conserved within, but not between, initiator subfamilies, suggesting that this region may help determine the specific function of orthologous and paralogous initator subunits (Fig. 2D and fig. S6) (13). Structural comparisons between initiators and other DNA binding AAA+ proteins reveal that ISMs overlap spatially with clade-specific AAA+ elements of proteins that contact nucleic acid in the interior of an oligomeric assembly (fig. S10) (25­27). Taken together, these findings suggest that the archaeal Orc1-1/Orc1-3·DNA interactions described here form the core of an initiator complex that will self-assemble upon activation to partially or fully encircle DNA during origin firing.

Structural Basis of DNA Replication Origin Recognition by an ORC Protein
Martin Gaudier, Barbara S. Schuwirth, Sarah L. Westcott, Dale B. Wigley* DNA replication in archaea and in eukaryotes share many similarities. We report the structure of an archaeal origin recognition complex protein, ORC1, bound to an origin recognition box, a DNA sequence that is found in multiple copies at replication origins. DNA binding is mediated principally by a C-terminal winged helix domain that inserts deeply into the major and minor grooves, widening them both. However, additional DNA contacts are made with the N-terminal AAA+ domain, which inserts into the minor groove at a characteristic G-rich sequence, inducing a 35° bend in the duplex and providing directionality to the binding site. Both contact regions also induce substantial unwinding of the DNA. The structure provides insight into the initial step in assembly of a replication origin and recruitment of minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase to that origin. rchaeal DNA replication and repair processes share closer similarity to those in eukaryotes than to those in eubacteria (1), albeit with fewer proteins and hence complexity. Furthermore, whereas some archaea have a single replication origin (2), others have multiple origins, more like the situation in eukaryotes (3, 4). Archaeal replication origins are recognized by proteins with homology to eukaryotic origin recognition complex (ORC) and Cdc6 proteins (often annotated as ORC/Cdc6 but referred to here as ORC). The number of ORC proteins varies between archaea but is usually one or two proteins, although it can be as many as 14 (4).

Crystal structures of two archaeal ORC proteins have been determined (5, 6). The proteins comprise two domains: an AAA+ domain (7) and a C-terminal domain of the winged helix (WH) family, a structural motif commonly used to bind to specific nucleic acid sequences (8). The isolated AAA+ domain retains adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, and the WH domain binds to DNA (6, 9). Analysis of archaeal genome sequences revealed a series of short (13 bp) conserved repeats located close to ORC genes that were proposed to be a signature for archaeal replication origins (10), which was confirmed experimentally in PyrococSCIENCE VOL 317

cus abysii (11, 12). The later study revealed that two longer repeats were located on either side of an AT-rich region named a duplex unwinding element (DUE). Similar repeats flank a DUE in a region of chromosomal DNA from Halobacterium that conveys autonomous replication to plasmids in that species (13). These extended repeat sequences were the origin recognition box (ORB) elements later identified at a replication origin in Sulfolobus solfataricus (14). The ORC1 protein of S. solfataricus footprints at these ORB elements in both P. abyssi and Halobacterium, demonstrating their conservation across species. Curiously, not all of the origins in Sulfolobus contain full-length ORB elements but instead have shorter sequences called mini-ORBs (14), also found at a proposed origin in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (10). The situation in Sulfolobus is complicated further because the three origins are quite different from one another and they all contain binding sites for multiple ORC proteins (14, 15). Using the sequence of the conserved ORB elements, Robinson et al. proposed the location of a replication origin for A. pernix (14), which was
