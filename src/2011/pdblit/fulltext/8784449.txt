High-resolution X-ray structures of the complexes of HIV-1 protease (HIV-1PR) with peptidomimetic inhibitors reveal the presence of a structural water molecule which is hydrogen bonded to both the mobile flaps of the enzyme and the two carbonyls flanking the transition-state mimic of the inhibitors. Using the structure-activity relationships of C2-symmetric diol inhibitors, computed-aided drug design tools, and first principles, we designed and synthesized a novel class of cyclic ureas that incorporates this structural water and preorganizes the side chain residues into optimum binding conformations. Conformational analysis suggested a preference for pseudodiaxial benzylic and pseudodiequatorial hydroxyl substituents and an enantiomeric preference for the RSSR stereochemistry. The X-ray and solution NMR structure of the complex of HIV-1PR and one such cyclic urea, DMP323, confirmed the displacement of the structural water. Additionally, the bound and "unbound" (small-molecule X-ray) ligands have similar conformations. The high degree of preorganization, the complementarity, and the entropic gain of water displacement are proposed to explain the high affinity of these small molecules for the enzyme. The small size probably contributes to the observed good oral bioavailability in animals. Extensive structure-based optimization of the side chains that fill the S2 and S2 pockets of the enzyme resulted in DMP323, which was studied in phase I clinical trials but found to suffer from variable pharmacokinetics in man. This report details the synthesis, conformational analysis, structure-activity relationships, and molecular recognition of this series of C2-symmetry HIV-1PR inhibitors. An initial series of cyclic ureas containing nonsymmetric P2/P2 is also discussed.
Introduction The RNA genome of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of acquired immunedeficiency syndrome (AIDS), encodes an essential aspartic protease (PR)1 that processes the viral gag and gag-pol polyproteins into structural and functional proteins. Inhibition of HIVPR in vitro results in the production of progeny virions which are immature and noninfectious.2 Under clinical settings, three HIVPR inhibitors, recently approved by FDA for AIDS therapy in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors, have been shown to reduce the viral load and increase the number of CD4+ lymphocytes in HIV-infected patients.3 In addition, the large abundance of structural information on the HIVPR has made the enzyme an attractive target for computer-aided drug design strategies.4 Consequently, HIVPR has become a prime focus for the development of HIV therapeutics.5 However, the daunting ability of the virus to rapidly generate resistant mutants3e,f,6 suggests that there is an ongoing need for new HIVPR inhibitors with superior pharmacokinetic and efficacy profiles.

High-resolution X-ray structures of the complexes of HIV-1 protease (HIV-1PR) with peptidomimetic inhibitors reveal the presence of a structural water molecule which is hydrogen bonded to both the mobile flaps of the enzyme and the two carbonyls flanking the transition-state mimic of the inhibitors4 (Figure 1a). The relevance of this structural water to the generation of HIVPR inhibitors had been previously noted.7 This water molecule is unique to all retroviral aspartic proteases but is absent in mammalian aspartic proteases such as renin.8 We recently described the rational design of a class of novel and highly potent cyclic urea inhibitors.9 The urea oxygen in the cyclic urea scaffold was designed to incorporate this structural water molecule (Figure 1b). Specifically, the design of these molecules was accomplished using structureactivity relationship (SAR) data generated from a series of acyclic C2-symmetric diols,5a,10 computer-aided drug

design tools, and first principles.9c,11 The displacement of the unique structural water molecule by incorporation into the inhibitor structure is expected to increase retroviral protease specificity and gain in entropy of binding. The entropic gain of liberating a tightly bound water molecule in proteins to the bulk solvent has been estimated as high as 2 kcal/mol.12 The cyclic urea scaffold also takes advantage of the principle of preorganization13 which states that "the more highly hosts and guests are organized for binding and low solvation prior to their complexation, the more stable will be their complexes". In our case, the preorganized inhibitor is anticipated to have higher affinity for HIVPR than its flexible counterpart since no conformational entropic penalty need be paid during binding, the penality having been prepaid during the synthesis of the preorganized structure. As a result of the increased potency of the cyclic ureas due to water displacement and preorganization, fewer subsites of the HIVPR active site need to be occupied to achieve a given level of inhibitory potency. An important consequence of reducing molecular weight is a higher probability of improved oral bioavailability.14 We describe here the conformational prediction, synthesis, P2/P2 structure-activity relationship, and molecular recognition of these cyclic urea HIV-1PR inhibitors. Results and Discussion Conformational Prediction. One of the critical features of our design strategy is the qualitative prediction of the conformation of seven-membered ring cyclic ureas. It is only with the correct prediction that the preferred stereochemistry complementary to the active site can be successfully evaluated using interactive graphics. The conformational analysis is shown in Figure 2. Seven-membered ring cyclic ureas can exist in two pseudochair conformations. When the nitrogens are unsubstituted, 1,3-diaxial strain15 dominates and conformer 2 with pseudodiequatorial benzyl groups and pseudodiaxial hydroxyl groups is preferred. In contrast, when the two nitrogens are substituted with P2/P2

groups, the converse is true even for a substituent as small as a methyl group. The partial double bond character of the urea C-N bond introduces severe allylic 1,2-strain16 between the benzylic groups and the nitrogen substituents. This allylic 1,2-strain overcomes the 1,3-diaxial strain, and conformer 3 with pseudodiaxial benzyl groups and pseudodiequatorial hydroxyl groups is preferred. This conformational prediction by first principles was subsequently confirmed by small-molecule X-ray crystallography (vide infra). With an idea of the preferred conformation in hand, we proceeded to determine the stereochemistry necessary for active site complementarity by interactive graphics. The preferred stereochemistry was predicted to be 4R,5S,6S,7R. It is with this stereochemistry that the P1/P1/P2/P2 side chains can project optimally into the S1/S1/S2/S2 pockets, respectively. The preferred RSSR stereochemistry is derived from unnatural Dphenylalanine. This contrasted with the SAR of acyclic C2-symmetric diols where the unnatural D-phenylalanine at P1/P1 is highly disfavored.17 The stereochemical predictions were subsequently confirmed by biological activity and X-ray structures (vide infra). Synthesis. The synthesis of cyclic ureas is shown in Scheme 1 as exemplified by 56, DMP323. Oxidation

of N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-(R)-phenylalaninol under Swern18 conditions gave 84% yield of the corresponding aldehyde. The aldehyde was then treated with VCl3, (THF)3 and zinc in methylene chloride at room temperature19 to give diol 5 in 55% yield with a diastereomeric purity of 98:2 (RSSR:RRRR) after purification. The diol was protected by treatment with [2-(trimethylsilyl)-

ethoxy]methyl chloride (SEMCl) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine in dry DMF at 50 °C in 91% yield, and the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) protecting groups were removed by hydrogenolysis with 10% Pd/C in ethyl acetate/methanol. The crude diamine was cyclized with carbonyl diimidazole (CDI) and pyridine in methylene chloride to give cyclic urea 6 in 52% yield (two steps). Alternatively, (2-methoxyethoxy)methyl chloride (MEMCl) could be used as the protecting group to give 7 in 62% overall yield from 5. Alkylation of 7 with p-cyanobenzyl bromide and NaH in anhydrous DMF gave the corresponding nitrile in 40% yield. Diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL) reduction of the nitrile gave the corresponding aldehyde in 43% yield. The aldehyde was further reduced to benzyl alcohol with sodium borohydride in ethanol followed by deprotection with HCl in methanol to give the desired cyclic urea 56 in 64% yield (two steps). Cyclic urea 60, DMP450, was synthesized by alkylation of 7 with m-nitrobenzyl bromide and NaH in DMF to give a 58% yield of the bisalkylated cyclic urea.34 Deprotection (82% yield) with HCl in methanol followed by hydrogenolysis (91% yield) with 10% Pd/C gave the free base of 60. Treatment of the free base with methanesulfonic acid provided 60. Cyclic ureas 3-55, 57-59, and 61 were synthesized using similar procedures. A summary of the physical data is given in Table 1. The nonsymmetrical cyclic urea 69 was synthesized as shown in Scheme 2. Alkylation of cyclic urea 7 with 4.0 equiv of NaH and 1.1 equiv of -naphthylmethyl bromide in dry DMF under nitrogen gave a 23% chromatographed yield of monoalkylated product (monoalkylation:bisalkylation is 1.4:1.0). Second alkylation (31% yield) of the monoalkylated product with 4 equiv of 4-picolyl chloride and 12 equiv of NaH in dry DMF followed by HCl deprotection (100% yield) gave nonsymmetric cyclic urea 69. Nonsymmetric cyclic ureas 62-73 were synthesized by a similar procedure. Deprotection of 7 with HCl in methanol followed by treatment with triethyl orthoacetate and catalytic ptoluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile provided crystalline unsubstituted cyclic urea 74 in 57% yield for the purpose of X-ray structural determination of conformation. Urea 75 was synthesized as shown in Scheme 3. (R)Phenylalaninol 4 was protected as MEM ether. Removal of the N-Cbz protecting group with hydrogen and 5% Pd/C in ethanol gave the amine which was coupled with CDI to form the urea. Benzylation of the urea with benzyl bromide and sodium hydride in DMF followed by deprotection with concentrated HCl and MeOH gave compound 75 in 21% overall yield. P2/P2 Structure-Activity Relationship and Molecular Recognition. HIVPR is an attractive protein to study the molecular recognition20 between macromolecules and small molecules, due to the abundance of high-resolution crystal structures of the HIVPRinhibitor complexes.4 The study is further simplified due to the C2-symmetric nature and small size (99 amino acids/monomer) of the HIVPR.4 We would like to describe the P2/P2 structure-activity relationship and molecular recognition study in terms of enantiomeric recognition, conformation, water displacement, and preorganization. Cyclic urea 3, with methyl substituents, inhibits HIV1PR with a Ki21 of 5700 nM as shown in Table 2. When

the size of the alkyl group was increased incrementally from methyl to n-heptyl as in 3 and 8-13, the optimal size was found to be n-butyl (10) with a Ki of 1.4 nM. Published X-ray structures4 revealed that the S2/S2 pockets are essentially lipophilic except toward the edge of the pockets near the entrance to the active site. The hydrophobic residues lining the S2/S2 pockets are Val 32/32, Ile 47/47, Gly 48/48, Ile 50/50, and Ile 84/84. The n-butyl group has the optimal length to form hydrophobic interactions with most of these lipophilic residues of the S2/S2 pockets. The antiviral activity in terms of IC90, the concentration of inhibitor resulting in 90% inhibition of viral RNA production in HIV-1infected MT-2 cells, was determined by quantifying the viral RNA with an oligonucleotide-based sandwich hybridization assay.21 For this series of n-alkyl compounds, 10 shows the lowest IC90. The translation of Ki to IC90 also seems to be optimal for 10, relative to the shorter or longer n-alkyls. The hydrophobic nature of the S2/S2 pockets was further demonstrated by the 2-3 orders of magnitude decrease in binding when hydrophilic oxygens were inserted into the n-alkyl side chains as in 14 (570×), 15 (690×), and 16 (30×) compared with the corresponding n-alkyls 10, 11, and 13, respectively. Methyl branching along the n-alkyl chains also decreases binding by 4.4-8.6-fold for 1720 relative to 9-12, respectively. Additional methyl branching as in 22 decreases binding 3.0-fold further, compared with 18. On the other hand, insertion of double bonds in order to rigidify the alkyl groups improves binding of 23 (1.5×), 24 (6.7×), 25 (6.7×), and 26 (18×) compared with 9, 17, 18, and 15, respectively. Conversion of the allyl group to the alkynyl group (27) loses 4.2-fold in binding. In the cycloalkyl series, 28-31, cyclobutylmethyl cyclic urea 29 was found to have the best Ki among the cycloalkylmethyl cyclic ureas. The oral bioavailability (F%) of cyclopropylmethyl cyclic urea 28 in rat was determined to be 100% with a Cmax of 4.3 µM at 10 mg/ kg dose. In dog, the oral bioavailability is 48% with a Cmax of 9.2 µM at similar dose. The low molecular

weight of this compound (434 g/mol) probably contributes to its excellent bioavailability. N-Morpholino-2ethyl cyclic urea 32, made to increase water solubility, was found to be a poor binder. This is probably due to the deleterious effect of the hydrophilic nitrogen in the lipophilic region of the S2/S2 pockets, as seen with oxygen above. Benzyl cyclic urea 33 showed a Ki of 3.0 nM, making it an attractive side chain for analoging. Picolyl substituents were introduced as in 34-36, and 3-picolyl cyclic urea 35 was found to be the best, with a Ki of only 3.2-fold weaker than that of the corresponding 33. According to the X-ray structures,4 the S2/S2 pockets are very large. R-Naphthylmethyl was introduced at P2/P2 as in 37 and found to be a poor binder. On the other hand, -naphthylmethyl cyclic urea 38 was found to be a subnanomolar inhibitor with a Ki of 0.31 nM. However, the translation of Ki to IC90 for 38 is rather poor, probably due to the extremely high lipophilicity of the molecule (clogP23 9.2). A series of regioisomeric halo (39-46), methyl (47, 48), trifluoromethyl (49,50), and methoxy (51-53) substituents were introduced on P2/P2 benzyl side chains. In general, the regioisomeric preference in decreasing order is meta, para, and ortho. Several of the paraisomers are within 2-3-fold of the meta-isomers in terms of Ki. Nitro substitution at the meta-position as in 54 gave a Ki of 2.8 nM. On the other hand, iodo substitution at the meta-position gave a Ki of 0.42 nM, making 55 the best binder in the m-halo series. Modeling revealed that there are a few hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, namely, the side chains and backbone amides of Asp 29/29 and Asp 30/30, close to the metaand para-positions of the N-benzyl groups. Hydroxy and hydroxymethyl groups were incorporated as in 56-59. These compounds indeed have Ki values in the subnanomolar range. Moreover, because of the reduced lipophilicity, the translation from Ki to IC90 is greatly improved. For example, cyclic urea 56 (clogP and HPLC log P are 4.8 and 3.6, respectively23) translates 2 orders of magnitude better than other subnanomolar inhibitors 38 (clogP 9.2), 43 (clogP 8.3), and 55 (clogP 9.1). The IC90's of these cyclic ureas, 56-59, are in the range of 0.032-0.057 µM. These cyclic ureas are orally bioavailable with Cmax of 0.39-0.83 µM at 10 mg/kg in rats and F% of 18-30.24 Among the hydroxy compounds, 56 has the best oral bioavailability in dogs, with 37% oral bioavailability and a Cmax of 2.8 µM at 10 mg/kg dose. In addition to hydroxy groups, amino groups were also

introduced as in 60 to provide another potent compound (IC90 130 nM) with greatly improved oral bioavailability in both rats and dogs. The oral bioavailability of 60 in dogs was as high as 79%, with a Cmax of 11.2 µM at a dose of 10 mg/kg.34 Cyclic urea 56 has a Ki of 0.34 nM, while its enantiomer 61 has a Ki of 1650 nM. This 4900-fold difference

in Ki confirmed our modeling prediction during the design stage that the RSSR stereochemistry as in 56 is the preferred one. Based on modeling, cyclic urea 61 cannot project P2/P2 into the corresponding S2/S2 pockets. The cyclic urea scaffold is symmetric, designed to be complementary to the C2-symmetric HIVPR.4 This

provides the synthetic advantage in structure-activity relationship studies as cyclic ureas with symmetric P2/ P2 side chains can be prepared easily to find the best P2/P2 side chains. Subsequently, the best P2/P2 side chains can be combined to make cyclic ureas with nonsymmetric P2/P2 side chains. Nonsymmetric cyclic ureas have the advantage of better solubility than symmetric cyclic ureas. For example, the symmetric cyclic ureas described above are in general poorly soluble in chloroform, whereas nonsymmetric cyclic ureas (vide infra) are more soluble in chloroform. We next describe the study of an initial series of nonsymmetric cyclic ureas containing a tight binding -naphthylmethyl group as one of the P2/P2 side chains as shown in Table 3. Nonsymmetric cyclic ureas 62-73 were prepared to examine the effect of nonsymmetric P2/P2 side chains on Ki. In general, the Ki of the nonsymmetric cyclic ureas falls within the range of the Ki constituted by the two corresponding parent symmetric cyclic ureas. Only 70-72 are outside the range; however, even these compounds are only 3-4-fold weaker. Cyclic urea 66 is an interesting compound. It is a combination of 11 (cyclopentylmethyl, Ki 4.3 nM) and 38 ( -naphthylmethyl, Ki 0.31 nM). It had a Ki of 0.28 nM, which is identical with that of the tighter binder 38, even though it contains a weaker cyclopentylmethyl group as one of the P2 substituents. The translation of Ki to IC90 of all these nonsymmetric cyclic ureas is 1-2 orders of magnitude better than the parent symmetric 38. This is due to the fact that 38 is too lipophilic (vide supra). We are currently actively exploring nonsymmetric cyclic ureas. The X-ray structure of the complex of 56 and HIV1PR was determined.25 As shown in Figure 3, the complex displays reasonably symmetric binding between the inhibitor and protease. The benzyl alcohols accept hydrogen bonds from the backbone NH of Asp 30/30 and Asp 29/29 as shown in Figure 4. The diols form multiple hydrogen bonds with catalytic Asp 25/ 25.26 The urea oxygen accepts two hydrogen bonds from the backbone NH of Ile 50/50. Thus, the inhibitor links the protease catalytic aspartates to the flexible flaps via a hydrogen bond network that does not include an

intervening water molecule. The displacement of the structural water was further confirmed by NMR ROESY experiments of the complex of isotopically enriched HIVPR-1/56.26 This water displacement is entropically favorable,12 contributing to the high potency of the cyclic ureas. The displacement of the structural water by inhibitors has been an area of active research.27,28 Recently the Parke Davis28a-c and Upjohn28d-f groups had independently discovered pyrone inhibitors based on random screening of in-house chemical collections. These pyrones have been confirmed to displace the structural water based on X-ray studies of the complexes.28 Attempts at preparing high-quality crystals of Nunsubstituted cyclic urea for X-ray crystallographic studies were unsuccessful. However, we were able to obtain crystals of 74 where one of the hydroxyl groups had been acetylated. The X-ray structure of 7429 shows that the conformation of N-unsubstituted cyclic urea has pseudodiequatorial benzyl and pseudodiaxial acetoxy and hydroxyl groups (Figure 5). For the methylsubstituted cyclic urea 3, the X-ray structure29 shows that 3 has adopted the alternative ring conformation with pseudodiaxial benzyl and pseudodiequatorial hydroxyl groups. X-ray structures of other N-substituted cyclic ureas have also been solved.29,30 They all share the same ring conformation as 3. Extensive NMR studies of the ring conformation of 60 in water had been performed. The result indicates that the ring conformation of 60 in water is similar to its solid-state X-ray conformation. These NMR experiments are being described in detail elsewhere.29 Figure 6 shows an overlap of bound and "unbound" (small-molecule crystal structure2) 56. The similarity of the two structures suggests that 56 is indeed highly preorganized13 for binding. To further evaluate the contribution of preorganization in the cyclic urea system, the corresponding seco compound 75 was used for comparison as shown in Figure 7. Cyclic urea 33 has a Ki of 2.5 nM, whereas urea 75 has a Ki of 6700 nM. This corresponds to a 4.8 kcal/mol gain in binding energy for 33 versus 75. This gain in binding energy reflects the preorganization of the side chains and diols of the cyclic urea structure relative to 75. In general, preorganization includes, but is not limited to, conformational entropic penality,13 hydrophobic collapse penalty,31 and desolvation cost.13 In our case, it is not possible to dissect these contributions. The above analysis was performed based on the assumption that 75 binds in a loose, relatively unstrained "pseudocyclic" conformation, close to that of 33 but with the methylene carbons bearing the hydroxy groups not in van der Waals contacts. This binding mode is not unreasonable since the diols would want to bind to the catalytic Asp 25/ 25.4 Nevertheless, this may or may not be the case. The extended conformation of urea 75 may be the lowenergy binding conformation, whereas the loose "pseudocyclic" conformation needed for comparison in Figure 7 is a higher energy conformation. In this case, the value of 4.8 kcal/mol as determined is not valid. Obtaining the X-ray structure of a complex of 75 and HIVPR can provide the answer. In consideration of the overall pharmacokinetic and safety parameters in animals, cyclic urea 56 was chosen as the first clinical candidate and designated DMP323.32

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1996, Vol. 39, No. 18 3521 which reduced the concentration of HIV viral RNA by 90% from the level measured in an untreated infected culture was designated the IC90. The cellular toxicity of compounds was assayed by measuring the extent of MTT dye reduction in uninfected MT-2 cell cultures grown for 3 days in the presence of various concentrations of test compound. The compound concentration which decreased the level of MTT dye reduction by 50% was designated the TC50. Only compounds which displayed an antiviral IC90 concentration which was at least 3-fold less than the TC50 concentration were considered to have a specific antiviral effect. Oral bioavailability was measured as previously described.24,32c Chemical Methods. All procedures were carried out under inert gas in oven-dried glassware unless otherwise indicated. Proton NMR spectra were obtained on VXR or Unity 300 or 400 MHz instruments (Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) with TMS as an internal reference standard. Melting points were determined on a Mettler SP61 apparatus and are uncorrected. Elemental analyses were performed by Quantitative Technologies, Inc., Bound Brook, NJ. Mass spectra were measured with a HP5988A mass spectrometer with particle beam interface using NH3 for chemical ionization or a Finnigan MAT 8230 mass spectrometer with NH3-DCI or VG TRIO 2000 for ESI. High-resolution mass spectra were measured on a VG 70-VSE instrument with NH3 chemical ionization. Separation of isomers was performed using supercritical fluid chromatography with a Chiracel OD column (Daicel Chemical Ind. Ltd.) and a 20% methanol-modified CO2 mobile phase. Optical rotations were obtained on a Perkin Elmer 241 polarimeter. Solvents and reagents were obtained from commercial vendors in the appropriate grade and used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. All compounds were determined to be homogeneous by TLC, elemental analysis, and/or HPLC. Phenylalaninol I, (R)-phenylmethyl [2-hydroxy-1-(phenylmethyl)ethyl]carbamate, was obtained from Synthetech, Inc. The optical rotation of the lot employed in the following sequence was [R]25D +41° (c 1.0, EtOH). (1R,2S,3S,4R)-Bis(phenylmethyl)[2,3-Dihydroxy-1,4bis(phenylmethyl)-1,4-butanediyl]bis[carbamate] (5). A solution of 52 mL of oxalyl chloride (0.59 mol) in 500 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) was cooled to -78 °C, and 57 mL of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (0.81 mol) was added in 500 mL of CH2Cl2 over 1 h while the temperature was maintained below -70 °C (caution: exothermic). Stirring was continued at -78 °C for 0.5 h, and 125 g of (R)-N-Cbz-phenylalaninol (4) (0.44 mol) was added in 800 mL of CH2Cl2 over 1 h, again maintaining the temperature below -70 °C, followed by stirring for 0.5 h at -78 °C. Triethylamine (244 mL) was added in 300 mL of CH2Cl2 over 0.5 h followed by stirring for 2 h at -70 °C. Addition of 800 mL of 20% aqueous KHSO4 was followed by allowing the mixture to warm to room temperature and addition of 300 mL of water. The aqueous phase was separated and washed with 400 mL of CH2Cl2. The combined organic layers from two such runs were washed with 1 L of saturated aqueous NaHCO3, 1 L of water, and 1 L of saturated aqueous NaCl, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated to 700 mL. Hexane (2 L) was added, the mixture was cooled in an ice bath for 1 h, and the solids were filtered and washed with cold hexane. After drying to constant weight at 40-50 °C, 209 g (84%) of a white solid was obtained: mp 82-83 °C; [R]25D +61.58° (c 0.406, MeOH); 1H NMR (CDCl3)  3.15 (d, J ) 7.0 Hz, 2H), 4.52 (q, J ) 7.0 Hz, 1H), 5.14 (s, 2H), 5.35 (br d, J ) 6.0 Hz, 1H), 7.10-7.42 (m, 10H), 9.65 (br s, 1H). The aldehyde, when pure, could be stored under inert atmosphere without racemization or trimerization. Runs were pooled as necessary for the following step. A 4-necked reaction flask was charged with 467 g of VCl3,(THF)3 (1.25 mol) and 1 L of CH2Cl2 in a drybox, removed from the drybox, and fitted with a reflux condenser, a nitrogen bubbler, and a thermocouple. Zinc dust (54 g, 0.83 mol, also weighed in the drybox) was added, and the temperature rose to 40 °C. The prepared aldehyde (350 g, 1.2 mol) was added rapidly in 700 mL of CH2Cl2, and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight. A flask containing 6 L of water and 500 mL of concentrated HCl was warmed until the solution reached about 65 °C. The reaction mixture was added by addition funnel and CH2Cl2 collected in a cooled flask as it

terminated. DMP450, with excellent water solubility (>170 mg/mL), was chosen as the second clinical candidate, and the human pharmacokinetics were found to be greatly improved, analogous to the animal models. The results of the clinical study of DMP450 are being described in detail elsewhere.34 Conclusion Cyclic ureas are in general potent inhibitors of HIVPR for molecules of their size.5 The molecular recognition features discussed above reveal that this is a result of preorganization and high complementarity in terms of conformation, stereochemistry, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bondings, and water displacement. The high potency results in relatively smaller size which probably contributes to good oral bioavailability in rats and dogs.14 We are continuing to explore nonsymmetric cyclic HIVPR inhibitors in order to find candidates with superior pharmacokinetic and efficacy profiles. Experimental Section
Biological Methods. Inhibition of HIVPR was measured by assaying the cleavage of a fluorescent peptide substrate using HPLC.21 The antiviral potency of compounds was assessed by measuring their effect on the accumulation of viral RNA transcripts 3 days after infection of MT-2 cells with HIV-1 RF.22 Uninfected cells were incubated in microtiter plate wells with serial dilutions of test compound in cell culture medium for 30 min; then virus was added. After 3 days of culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2, infected cell cultures were lysed and the levels of HIV RNA determined using a microtiter plate-based hybridization assay. The concentration of test compound

When addition was completed, the mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and the precipitate collected and washed with water until colorless. The solid was further washed with 1.2 L of ethanol followed by 1.2 L of hexane. Two of the above runs were combined and recrystallized by dissolving in hot THF and filtering away insoluble material. Hexane was added and the mixture allowed to cool.

To a solution of 40 g (70 mmol) of diol 5 in 150 mL of dry DMF under nitrogen was added 37 mL (211 mmol) of [2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methoxy chloride (SEMCl) followed by 38 mL (230 mmol) of diisopropylethylamine. The mixture was heated at 50 °C for 48 h. After cooling, the mixture was partitioned between CH2Cl2 and 5% HCl.

To a solution of 5.50 g (10.9 mmol) of MEM-protected cyclic urea 7 in 50 mL of dry dimethylformamide was added 2.60 g (65.6 mmol) of 60% sodium hydride in mineral oil. The mixture was stirred for 15 min and cooled to 0 °C, and 8.58 g (43.8 mmol) of 4-cyanobenzyl bromide in DMF was added. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 15 min and at room temperature for 2 h and then hydrolyzed with water and extracted with ether to give an oil that was purified by flash chromatography using 15% ethyl acetate in methylene chloride. This yielded 3.2 g (40%) of the nitrile as a semisolid: MS m/z 733 (M + 1, 100). The nitrile (2.74 g, 3.74 mmol) was dissolved in 15 mL of dry toluene under nitrogen and cooled to -78 °C. To this

Lam et al. solution was added 5.48 mL (8.22 mmol) of DIBAL-H (1.5 M in toluene) dropwise, and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stir overnight. The mixture was then washed with cold 5% HCl, water, saturated sodium bicarbonate, and brine and dried with MgSO4. Evaporation of solvent followed by flash chromatography with 20% ethyl acetate in methylene chloride gave 1.18 g (43%) of aldehyde as a gum: MS m/z 739 (M + 1, 100). The aldehyde (1.00 g, 1.35 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol and treated with 65 mg of sodium borohydride. The mixture was refluxed for 3 h. After cooling, the mixture was partitioned between ether and water. The ether phase was washed twice with water and brine and dried with magnesium sulfate.

(4S,5R,6R,7S)-Hexahydro-5,6-dihydroxy-1,3-bis[[4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl]methyl]-4,7-bis(phenylmethyl)-2H1,3-diazepin-2-one (61). Following method A for 56, one can prepare the corresponding enantiomer 61 as a white solid: mp 198 °C; 1H NMR (CD3OD)  2.93 (d, J ) 15 Hz, 2H), 2.903.05 (m, 4H), 3.53 (br s, 2H), 3.68 (br d, 2H), 4.75 (d, J ) 15 Hz, 2H), 7.05-7.35 (m, 18H); MS (CI) m/z 567 (100, M + 1); [R]25D -101° (c 0.466, EtOH). Anal. (C35H38N2O5,H2O) C, H, N. (4R,5S,6S,7R)-Hexahydro-5,6-dihydroxy-1-(4-pyridylmethyl)-3-( -naphthylmethyl)-4,7-bis(phenylmethyl)-2H1,3-diazepin-2-one (69). To a mixture of 2.03 g (50.9 mmol) of 60% NaH in mineral oil (washed with hexane) in 20 mL of dry DMF under nitrogen was added a solution of 6.40 g (12.7 mmol) of di-MEM-protected cyclic urea 7. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min. A solution of 3.16 g (14.0 mmol) of 2-(bromomethyl)naphthylene was added and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 8 h. The reaction was quenched with methanol and partitioned between ethyl acetate and water. The organic phase was washed with water and brine and dried with MgSO4. After rotovaping, 7.5 g of a residue was obtained and chromatographed with a gradient of EtOAc and hexane to give 1.77 g (23%) of mononaphthylmethyl cyclic urea (MS m/z 643 (M + 1), 100), 1.51 g (16%) of bis(naphthylmethyl) cyclic urea, and 2.31 g (36%) of starting material. The mononaphthylmethyl cyclic urea was alkylated with 4 equiv of 4-picolyl chloride and 12 equiv of NaH at room temperature for 2 weeks following method A to give 31% yield of MEM-protected 4-picolyl cyclic urea. Similar acid deprotection (100% yield) followed by preparative TLC (70% EtOAc/ hexane) gave 69 as a white solid: mp 118-120 °C; 1H NMR (CDCl3)  2.90-3.40 (m, 4H), 2.98 (d, J ) 15 Hz, 1H), 3.25 (d, J ) 15 Hz, 1H), 3.65 (br d, 2 H), 4.95 (d, J ) 15 Hz, 1H), 5.07 (d, J ) 15 Hz, 1H), 7.05-7.35 (m, 17H), 7.67 (d, J ) 7.5 Hz, 2H), 8.15 (d, J ) 7.5 Hz, 2H); MS (CI) m/z 558 (100, M + 1).

Di-MEMprotected cyclic urea 7 (50.2 g, 0.1 mol) was dissolved in MeOH (250 mL) and cooled in an ice bath to 0 °C. HCl (g) was bubbled into the solution for 10 min, and the mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 1 h. The mixture was concentrated at room temperature on a rotary evaporator to give the diol as a white solid. The resulting diol was suspended in acetonitrile (300 mL) and treated with 34.5 g (0.2 mol) of triethyl orthoacetate and 0.5 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid. The suspension was stirred until TLC analysis showed all the diol was consumed and formation of the ortho ester was complete. Then 50 mL of water was added and the mixture stirred for 30 min until all the ortho ester was converted to the monoacetate. The mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give a solid residue. The resulting residue was recrystallized from ethyl acetate to give 21 g (57%) of 74 as a white solid: mp 194-195 °C; 1H NMR (CDCl3)  2.08 (s, 3H), 2.64-2.83 (m, 3H), 2.86 (d, J ) 8.0 Hz, 2H), 3.56 (q, J ) 4.4 Hz, 1H), 3.79 (t, J ) 7.7 Hz, 1H), 3.92 (br t, J ) 7.7 Hz, 1H), 4.80 (d, J ) 4.4 Hz, 1H), 7.19-7.12 (m, 4H), 7.33-7.21 (m, 6H); 13C NMR (CDCl3)  21.27, 38.45, 38.88, 51.35, 53.75, 57.56, 72.57, 120.44, 127.69, 127.82, 129.39, 129.50, 136.40, 136.80, 164.41, 170.31.

A solution of 28.5 g (0.1 mol) of (R)-N-Cbz-phenylalaninol (4), 18.7 g (0.15 mol) of (2methoxyethoxy)methyl chloride (MEMCI), and 26.1 mL (0.15 mol) of diisopropylethylamine in 200 mL of dry methylene chloride was stirred at room temperature overnight. TLC showed no starting material. The reaction mixture was washed with water, dried with MgSO4, and evaporated to dryness to give 37.9 g of crude MEM ether as a brown oil. To a solution of 18.7 g (50 mmol) of the crude MEM ether in 200 mL of ethanol was added 3.7 g of 5% Pd/C. The mixture was treated with 1 atm of hydrogen for 2 h until TLC showed no starting material. The mixture was filtered and evaporated to dryness to give 11.9 g of crude diamine. The crude diamine

The mixture was evaporated and partitioned between CH2Cl2 and water. The organic phase was washed with water twice, dried with MgSO4, and evaporated to give 11.6 g of crude urea. The crude urea (2.52 g, 5.0 mmol) was benzylated with 5.13 g (30 mmol) of benzyl bromide and 1.2 g (83 mmol) of 60% NaH in mineral oil in anhydrous DMF under nitrogen. The reaction was completed overnight as monitored by TLC. The final reaction mixture was poured into ice/water and extracted with EtOAc. The organic phase was washed with water six times, dried with MgSO4, and evaporated to dryness. The crude product was chromatographed (hexane/EtOAc, 1:1) to give 2.03 g of a light colored oil. The oil (1.1 g, 1.6 mmol) was dissolved in 200 mL of methanol and 40 mL of concentrated HCl added slowly. The mixture was allowed to stir overnight and poured into ice/saturated NaHCO3. The crude product was chromatographed (CH2Cl2/MeOH, 100:1) to give 300 mg (21% overall yield) of urea diol 75 as a solid: mp 116 °C; 1H NMR (CDCl3)  2.88 (d, J ) 6.0 Hz, 4H), 3.48-3.70 (m, 6H), 3.75 (d, J ) 15 Hz, 2H), 4.18 (d, J ) 15 Hz, 2H), 4.82 (br s, 2H), 7.00-7.35 (m, 10H); MS (CI) m/z 509 (M + 1, 100); HRMS calcd 509.2804, found 509.2799; [R]25D +80.0° (c 0.015, MeOH).
