Calorimetric Analysis of the Ca2-binding b g -Crystallin Homolog Protein S from Myxococcus xanthus: Intrinsic Stability and Mutual Stabilization of Domains
Martina Wenk and Rainer Jaenicke*
È Institut fur Biophysik und Physikalische Biochemie È Universitat Regensburg D-93040, Regensburg Germany The bg-crystallin superfamily consists of a class of homologous twodomain proteins with Greek-key fold. Protein S, a Ca2-binding sporecoat protein from the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus exhibits a high degree of sequential and structural homology with gB-crystallin from the vertebrate eye lens. In contrast to gB-crystallin, which undergoes irreversible aggregation upon thermal unfolding, protein S folds reversibly and may therefore serve as a model in the investigation of the thermodynamic stability of the eye-lens crystallins. The thermal denaturation of recombinant protein S (PS) and its isolated domains was studied by differential scanning calorimetry in the absence and in the presence of Ca2 at varying pH. Ca2-binding leads to a stabilization of PS and its domains and increases the cooperativity of their equilibrium unfolding transitions. The isolated N-terminal and C-terminal domains (NPS and CPS) obey the two-state model, independent of the pH and Ca2-binding; in the case of PS, under all conditions, an equilibrium intermediate is populated. The ®rst transition of PS may be assigned to the denaturation of the C-terminal domain and the loss of domain interactions, whereas the second one coincides with the denaturation of the isolated N-terminal domain. At pH 7.0, in the presence of Ca2, where PS exhibits maximal stability, the domain interactions at 20  C contribute 20 kJ/mol to the overall stability of the intact protein.

Introduction
The b and g-crystallins of the vertebrate eye lens comprise a family of homologous two-domain proteins with all-b-structure (Wistow & Piatigorsky, 1988). Each domain of b and g-crystallins consists of two Greek-key motifs forming two fourstranded antiparallel b-sheets (Blundell et al., 1981; White et al., 1989; Bax et al., 1990). The crystallins are highly stable proteins; their long-term stability is the physical basis of the transparency of the lens over the whole life-span of an individual (Jaenicke,

1994, 1999). The conserved sequence signature of the bg-crystallins led to the identi®cation of prokaryotic and eukaryotic non-lens members of this superfamily of proteins. They are all expressed under adverse environmental conditions, or in speci®cally differentiating tissues: (1) the development-speci®c or stress-induced spherulin 3a of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, a singledomain double Greek-key protein, gains stability from dimerization and Ca2-binding (Wistow, 1990; Rosinke et al., 1997; Kretschmar et al., 1999a,b). (2) EDSP or ep37, an epidermal differentiation-speci®c protein of the amphibian Cynops pyrrhogaster (Wistow et al., 1995; Ogawa et al., 1997) and (3) AIM1, a factor associated with the tumorigenicity in human malignant melanoma (Ray et al., 1997) are vertebrate representatives. (4) Protein S, a stress-induced protein from the soil-bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, is involved in spore-coat formation; again, it has been found to exhibit a high degree of sequential (Wistow et al.,

118 1985) and structural (Bagby et al., 1994a,b,c) similarity with gB-crystallin from the vertebrate eye lens. Protein S is a monomeric Ca2-binding protein of 173 amino acid residues, with two highly homologous double Greek-key domains connected by a short linker peptide. Each domain contains a short a-helix and can bind Ca2; for the isolated N-terminal domain (NPS), two Ca2-binding sites were identi®ed by X-ray analysis (Wenk et al., 1999). As in gB-crystallin, the domains of PS form an intramolecular interface in contrast to the domainswapped intermolecular interface of the dimeric bB2-crystallin (Lapatto et al., 1991; Bagby et al., 1994a,b,c). PS and its isolated domains, NPS and CPS, were cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli and puri®ed to homogeneity. A detailed spectroscopic characterization revealed that all three recombinant proteins are authentic, highly soluble and monomeric, independent of the presence or absence of Ca2. NPS is signi®cantly more stable than CPS. Both domains in PS fold independently, populating an equilibrium intermediate with native N-terminal and unfolded C-terminal domain. Ca2-binding and domain interactions lead to a thermodynamic and kinetic stabilization, and an increase in the cooperativity of unfolding for the intact protein. PS and its isolated domains refold reversibly after thermal denaturation even at concentrations as high as 2 mg/ml (Wenk & Mayr, 1998; Wenk et al., 1998, 1999). A detailed thermodynamic characterization of the stabilities of gB and bB2-crystallin and their isolated domains is not accessible due to the incomplete reversibility of thermal unfolding (Rudolph et al., 1990; Sharma et al., 1990; Mayr et al., 1997; Wieligmann et al., 1998). PS, NPS and CPS show reversible thermal unfolding. Therefore, they can serve as model systems for a detailed thermal analysis of eye lens crystallins. In this study, we

used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for the determination of the thermodynamic parameters of the stability of PS and its domains. The interpretation of the data is based on the known three-dimensional structures of protein S and NPS, and a previously published, detailed spectroscopic characterization (Bagby et al., 1994a,b,c, 1998; Wenk & Mayr, 1998; Wenk et al., 1998, 1999).

Results
Reversibility and pH stability PS and isolated NPS are stable in a wide pH range from pH 1.5-9.0 (Figure 1). In contrast, isolated CPS is denatured at pH < 3.0 (Wenk et al., 1999). All three proteins aggregate during the melting process at pH values near their isoelectric points (pH 3.5-5.0). Therefore, for PS and NPS, DSC measurements were performed at pH values between 1.5 and 3.0 and at pH 7.0 and 9.0, for CPS only at pH 7.0 and 9.0 (Figure 1; Tables 1 and 2). Thermal unfolding is reversible to at least 90 %, independent of the presence or absence of Ca2. Repetitive scans of the same samples at pH 7.0 in the presence of 3 mM CaCl2 are shown as insets in Figure 1. The melting pro®les are independent of the protein concentration and the heating rate (Tables 1 and 2). For the given reasons, the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics may be applied to evaluate the data. Thermal unfolding of PS and its isolated domains PS does not bind Ca2 in the acidic pH range (Wenk & Mayr, 1998; Wenk et al., 1999). In accordance, the thermodynamic parameters (tM, ÁHM) at pH 1.5-3.0 (calculated from the equilibrium transitions in the presence of either 3 mM CaCl2 or 1 mM EDTA) are identical within the limits of

error (Table 1). Figure 1 illustrates the dependence of the partial molar heat capacity on pH in the presence of Ca2. At pH 1.5-3.0, PS shows biphasic melting pro®les, whereas at pH 7.0 and 9.0, unfolding is monophasic (Figure 1(A)). For the melting pro®les of the isolated domains, two-state behavior is observed over the whole pH range (Figure 1(B) and (C)). For all three proteins, the calculated partial molar heat capacities of the native and unfolded states, CP,n and CP,u, coincide with the baselines determined experimentally. As reported earlier (Wenk et al., 1999), CPS exhibits a signi®cantly lower stability than NPS. Ca2binding leads to a shift of the melting points of all three proteins, PS, NPS and CPS, to higher temperatures with a parallel increase of the enthalpy changes ÁHM (Tables 1 and 2). For PS, in addition, Ca2-binding enhances the cooperativity of folding.

At pH 7.0, the two separated transitions at tM1  53(Æ1) C and tM2  64(Æ1) C are turned into one with tM % 65  C. Fitting the DSC pro®les of PS at all pH values in the presence and in the absence of Ca2 reveals that PS generally obeys a threestate model with a signi®cantly populated equilibrium intermediate (Figure 2(A)). In contrast, the isolated domains obey the two-state model, independent of the pH and the presence of Ca2 (Figure 2(B) and (C)). The thermodynamic parameters for the three proteins are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Á CP determination The strong dependencies of tM and ÁHM on pH allow the determination of the molar heat capacity changes of PS and its isolated domains from plots

illustrated in Figure 3. For all three proteins, linear correlations are obtained. The parameters for the ®rst transition of PS in the absence and in the presence of Ca2 can be ®tted with one and the same data set. In contrast, for the second transition of PS, the values of the Ca2-free protein at pH 7 and 9 deviate from the straight line, de®ned by the values at low pH and those for the Ca2-bound protein at pH 7 and 9. The slopes yield ÁCP % 6.7 kJ KÀ1 molÀ1 and ÁCP % 6.1 kJ KÀ1 molÀ1 for the ®rst and second transition, respectively (Figure 3(A)). For NPS, ÁCP % 6.1 kJ KÀ1 molÀ1 is obtained. As mentioned earlier in connection with the second transition of PS, the results for the Ca2-free protein deviate from a straightline ®t (Figure 3(B)). For CPS, the determination of ÁCP from the ÁHM versus tM plot is based on the fact that the parameters for the second transition of PS coincide with those of isolated NPS; thus, the ®rst transition may be attributed to the C-terminal domain. Since the line for the ÁCP determination of the ®rst transition of PS ®ts both the Ca2-free and the Ca2-liganded protein at pH 7 and 9, this can be assumed for the ®t of the data for CPS. The

determination of ÁCP for CPS from the slope of the ®tted line yields %6.3 kJ KÀ1 molÀ1 (Figure 3(C)). Since no deviation of the partial molar heat capacities of the native and unfolded proteins can be observed at varying Ca2- saturation (Figure 1), the ÁCP values are assumed to be the same for the Ca2-free and the Ca2-liganded proteins. Gibbs free energy of unfolding and domain interactions PS and its isolated domains show maximum thermal stability at neutral pH (Figure 1; Tables 1 and 2). Figure 4 shows the DSC scans of the three proteins at pH 7.0 in the presence and in the absence of 3 mM CaCl2. The transitions of NPS and CPS coincide; however, the difference in the thermal stability is striking: the C-terminal domain in PS exceeds CPS with regard to its intrinsic stability, whereas for the N-terminal domain the opposite holds true. For a quantitative comparison, the Gibbs free energies of unfolding at 20  C were calculated, making use of the experimental data in Table 3 and equation (1):

The resulting ÁG versus t plots for the three proteins are compared in Figure 5. As mentioned above, the thermodynamic parameters coincide for the second transition of PS and the transition of NPS. Only a slight destabilization of the N-terminal domain of PS can be observed in comparison with NPS. The maximum of the stability pro®le is around 20  C; Ca2-binding mainly shifts the curves vertically to higher ÁG values (Figure 5(A) and (B)). In contrast, the stability curve of the ®rst transition of PS (corresponding to CPS) shows both a lateral shift to higher temperatures and a vertical shift to higher ÁG values. Both effects are enhanced in the presence of Ca2 (Figure 5(C) and (D)). The maxima of the stability curves of the ®rst transition of PS (and the transition of CPS) are clearly shifted downward in comparison to the second transition of PS (and the transition of NPS). Obviously, in intact PS, the C-terminal domain gains stability from domain interactions. The ®rst transition of PS re¯ects the melting of the C-terminal domain and the loss of domain interactions. Comparing the ÁG values at 20  C (Table 3), the free energy contribution of the domain interactions at pH 7.0 and 20  C can be calculated using equation (2) (Brandts et al., 1989): ÁGdomain interaction  ÁGfirst transition PS À ÁGCPS 2

13 kJ/mol and 20 kJ/mol, respectively. The calorimetrically determined Gibbs free energies ÁG (20  C, pH 7.0) for the isolated domains agree well with those determined from urea-induced unfolding transitions (Table 3; cf. Wenk et al., 1999). Since the unfolding of PS does not follow a cooperative two-state transition, its stability cannot be expressed by a single ÁG value but only by a set of values specifying the intrinsic stabilities of the two domains and their mutual interaction (Privalov & Gill, 1988).

Discussion
Because of its monomeric state, its high solubility and the reversibility of its equilibrium denaturation transitions, protein S and its isolated domains are well-suited model systems for calorimetric studies on the thermodynamic stability of domain proteins belonging to the bg-crystallin superfamily. Both isolated domains exhibit twostate unfolding behaviour without equilibrium intermediates, as observed for other proteins with less than 90 amino acid residues (Capaldi & Radford, 1998). Similar to results reported for the domains of gB and bB2-crystallin (Mayr et al., 1997; Wieligmann et al., 1999), the domains exhibit signi®cant differences in their stability, despite their high structural similarity. Regarding the changes in heat capacity (ÁCP) and the observed ÁG versus t pro®les, NPS and CPS exhibit similar characteristics. The observed ÁCP values (6.2Æ1.5 kJ KÀ1 molÀ1) for both NPS and CPS are in agreement with the average value (5.5Æ1.0 kJ KÀ1 molÀ1) reported for proteins of similar size (Myers et al.,

The results for the domain interactions in intact PS, in the absence and in the presence of Ca2 are

1995). The lower thermal stability of CPS results from a shift of the maximum of the stability pro®le to lower temperatures. The shapes of the curves for the isolated domains coincide with those of other small mesophilic proteins (McCrary et al., 1996); this holds especially for NPS with its small ÁCP value and its extended range of thermal stability (Alexander et al., 1992). Ca2-binding has no effect on the molar heat capacity changes, it merely shifts the stability curves vertically by about 10 kJ/ mol to higher free energies. For NPS and the Nterminal domain of PS, slight deviations of the measured values in the absence of Ca2 from the ®tted ÁCP-line (values in the acidic pH range and in the presence of Ca2) are observed. Bagby et al. (1998) concluded from NMR measurements, that the isolated N-terminal domain in the protonated form at pH 2.6 shows closer structural similarity to the Ca2-loaded protein at pH 7.0 than to the Ca2-free protein at the same pH. Obviously, calcium ions are involved in charge screening, so that their absence leads to destabilization due to electrostatic repulsion. For the isolated and the integrated C-terminal domain, this effect is not observed. In the intact two-domain protein, the C-terminal domain is mainly stabilized by domain interactions, especially at acidic pH, where the isolated CPS is already unfolded. Ca2-binding stabilizes CPS only slightly, but in the intact protein, the cooperativity of folding is strongly enhanced. Domain interactions seem to increase the Ca2binding constant in the C-terminal domain in a way similar to that reported for Fe3-binding to

ovotransferrin (Lin et al., 1991). However, even in the presence of Ca2, PS unfolds according to a three-state model with an equilibrium intermediate signi®cantly populated. The ®rst transition can be assigned to the melting of the C-terminal domain and the loss of domain interactions, whereas the second transition coincides with the melting of the N-terminal domain; the latter is slightly destabilized in PS compared to NPS, as was observed for tropomyosin, enzyme I from Salmonella typhimurium, IIABman from E. coli and IIABmtl from E. coli (Potekhin & Privalov, 1982; LiCalsi et al., 1991; Marcovic-Housley et al., 1994; Meijberg et al., 1996). Only the domain with the lower melting point is stabilized by domain interactions; these interactions are lost when the C-terminal domain unfolds (Brandts et al., 1989). Thus, the free energy of the domain interactions in PS can be calculated from the difference of the stabilities of the integrated and the isolated C-terminal domain. At pH 7.0 and 20  C, in the presence of Ca2, the result is ÁGdomain interaction % 20 kJ/mol. For gBcrystallin at pH 2.0, urea-induced unfolding transitions yielded ÁGdomain interaction % 16 kJ/mol, with the difference that in this case independent domain folding could be observed only at acidic pH (Mayr et al., 1997). From urea-unfolding experiments, it can be estimated, that the domain interactions in gB-crystallin at pH 7.0 must be about an order of magnitude stronger than those in PS: while the latter shows a half-concentration c1/2, urea % 5 M, gBcrystallin cannot be unfolded in urea at pH 7.0 at all. Accordingly, an (irreversible) DSC scan at pH 2.0 revealed higher melting points of the gB-

crystallin domains (tM1  48  C and tM2  56  C) (Rudolph et al., 1990) than those observed for the PS domains (tM1  35  C and tM2  47  C). In gBcrystallin, the domain interface contains mainly hydrophobic residues (Blundell et al., 1981; Palme et al., 1997), whereas in PS hydrogen bonding seems to be involved in the domain interactions. In this context, the large difference in the size of the domain interfaces needs consideration; the respectÊ Ê ive values are 1780 A2 for gB, and 930 A2 for PS (Bagby et al., 1994b). Little is known about the structure-function relationship of PS, except for its relatively unspeci®c role as a protectant of the myxospore. In contrast, bg-crystallins are part of a highly complex multicomponent system with meticuously regulated physical properties. As a consequence, it is not surprising that, in spite of the close similarity in their 3D structure and their folding characteristics, PS and gB-crystallin show drastic differences in stability, domain interactions, hydrophobicity and other thermodynamic and kinetic properties. Topological similarity and functional variability based on slight local modulations of the structure are the way that evolution adapts proteins to different needs.

Materials and Methods
Materials Glycine was of analytical grade and purchased from Biomol (Ilvesheim, Germany). A-grade cacodylic acid (sodium salt trihydrate) was obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Proteins Cloning, expression and puri®cation of recombinant PS and its isolated domains were as described by Wenk & Mayr (1998) and Wenk et al. (1999). Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance using speci®c absorption coef®cients of A280 nm, 0.1 %, 1 cm  0.49 (PS), 0.43 (NPS) and 0.39 (CPS). Differential scanning calorimetry DSC studies were performed using a Nano-DSC CSC 6100 calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp., Provo, UT, USA) at a constant heating rate of 1 K/minute. The following buffers were used throughout the experiments: pH 1.5-3.0, 20 mM glycine/HCl, 1 mM EDTA or 3 mM CaCl2; pH 7.0, 20 mM sodium cacodylate, 1 mM EDTA or 3 mM CaCl2; pH 9.0, 20 mM glycine/NaOH, 1 mM EDTA or 3 mM CaCl2. Samples were dialysed against a 1000-fold volume of buffer for at least 16 hours. Buffers were ®ltered and degassed by evacuation; protein solutions were centrifuged and degassed before the concentration was determined by absorption spectroscopy. Solvent baselines and samples were measured under identical conditions. To examine the reversibility of folding, the protein was cooled after the ®rst unfolding transition, and heated a second time. Data were analyzed with the deconvolution software CpCalc 2.1 of the CSC 6100 (Privalov et al., 1995) using calculated molecular masses of 18.661 kDa (PS), 9.384 kDa (NPS), 10.249 kDa
