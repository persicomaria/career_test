ABSTRACT: Cytochrome bc1 is an integral membrane protein complex essential to cellular respiration and photosynthesis. The Q cycle reaction mechanism of bc1 postulates a separated quinone reduction (Qi) and quinol oxidation (Qo) site. In a complete catalytic cycle, a quinone molecule at the Qi site receives two electrons from the bH heme and two protons from the negative side of the membrane; this process is specifically inhibited by antimycin A and NQNO. The structures of bovine mitochondrial bc1 in the presence or absence of bound substrate ubiquinone and with either the bound antimycin A1 or NQNO were determined and refined. A ubiquinone with its first two isoprenoid repeats and an antimycin A1 were identified in the Qi pocket of the substrate and inhibitor bound structures, respectively; the NQNO, on the other hand, was identified in both Qi and Qo pockets in the inhibitor complex. The two inhibitors occupied different portions of the Qi pocket and competed with substrate for binding. In the Qo pocket, the NQNO behaves similarly to stigmatellin, inducing an iron-sulfur protein conformational arrest. Extensive binding interactions and conformational adjustments of residues lining the Qi pocket provide a structural basis for the high affinity binding of antimycin A and for phenotypes of inhibitor resistance. A two-water-mediated ubiquinone protonation mechanism is proposed involving three Qi site residues His201, Lys227, and Asp228.

The quinol-cyt. c oxidoreductase (EC 1.10.2.2, bc1)1 is a dimeric integral membrane protein complex and a central component of cellular energy conservation machinery in animals, plants, and bacteria. bc1 catalyzes ET from a quinol molecule to cyt. c and concomitantly translocates protons across membranes for ATP synthesis and various cellular processes (1-3). Although subunit composition varies among different organisms, all bc1 complexes contain at least three redox-active subunits carrying four prosthetic groups: a cyt. b with two b-type hemes, bH and bL; a cyt. c1 with one c-type

heme; and an ISP containing a 2Fe-2S cluster (for review, see ref 4). The proton-motive Q cycle mechanism (4, 5) best explains experimental results on the ET pathway through the four redox centers of the bc1 complex. The mechanism postulates two separate quinone binding sites, one for quinol oxidation (Qo site) and the other for quinone reduction (Qi site), and a bifurcated electron flow at the Qo site where the first electron from the substrate quinol is transferred sequentially to the ISP, cyt. c1, and eventually to the soluble electron acceptor cyt. c, whereas the second electron is transferred to hemes bL and bH in sequence, ending at a quinone or a semiquinone anion at the Qi site. Two protons are released into the positive side of membranes (periplasma in prokaryotes and intermembrane space in mitochondria) for every quinol oxidized. The fully reduced quinone at the Qi site picks up two protons from the negative side of membranes (cytoplasma in prokaryotes and matrix space in mitochondria) and presumably moves to the Qo site for reoxidation. Thus, a complete Q cycle consumes two molecules of quinol at the Qo site, generates one quinol molecule at the Qi site, and translocates four protons to the positive side of the membrane. Specific bc1 inhibitors are divided into two classes based on their points of action: class I for Qo site inhibitors and class II for Qi site inhibitors. The class I inhibitors such as stigmatellin and myxothizaol inhibit electron bifurcation at the Qo site and can be further subdivided into three subgroups on the basis of common structural features and of their effects

on the spectroscopic behavior of cyt. b and ISP (6-9). Class II inhibitors, exemplified by the antimycin A, block the ET path from heme bH to quinone or semiquinone. Antimycin A, a natural fungicide produced by Streptomyces sp., acts specifically on the bc1 complex in respiratory and photosynthetic organisms with an extraordinarily high binding affinity. In bovine bc1, the dissociation constant of bound antimycin A reaches 32 pM (6). Although preliminary crystallographic analyses of the bovine bc1-antimycin A complex were reported (8, 10-12), no refined crystal structure has been published. NQNO, another commonly used synthetic Qi site inhibitor and structurally dissimilar to the antimycin A, binds to bc1 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 64 nM and can be displaced by antimycin A (6, 13). NQNO reportedly possessed inhibitory effects at the Qo site (14), but it was considered as a nonspecific effect in the literature (6). Resistant mutations showed that antimycin A and NQNO affected different sets of Qi site residues, suggesting that their binding sites may be different. Atomic models of mitochondrial bc1 from several species obtained by X-ray crystallography have led to a rapid expansion of structural knowledge of bc1 at atomic detail (9-11, 15, 16). Among many important structural features, two inhibitor-binding pockets were identified within the cyt. b subunit: one with bound antimycin A near the bH heme and the other with many bound Qo site inhibitors such as the myxothiazol, stigmatellin, and famoxadone in the vicinity of the bL heme (8-11, 16) and were designated as the Qi and Qo site, respectively. Negative electron density in the isomorphous difference Fourier map between antimycin A bound and the native bc1 crystal was tentatively interpreted as a bound ubiquinone molecule in the native bc1 (10), which was replaced by the inhibitor antimycin A in the complex. More recently, a ubiquinone molecule was modeled into the Qi site based on experimental electron density and refined for the yeast bc1 structure in the presence of bound stigmatellin and a Fv fragment (16). Mechanistically, proton uptake at the Qi site was approached in the context of a lipid environment; two potential

proton uptake pathways were proposed based on analysis of bound water molecules (17). Details of specific binding interactions for Qi site inhibitors, as well as the involvement of active site residues in proton uptake, are not well-defined. Here, we report the crystallographically refined structures of bovine heart mitochondrial cyt. bc1 in the presence or absence of the substrate ubiquinone, and in complex with inhibitors of either antimycin A1 or NQNO at the Qi site, and discuss the mechanisms of inhibition as well as quinone reduction and protonation at the Qi site. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Preparation and Crystallization. Cyt. bc1 complex from bovine heart mitochondria was prepared as described previously (10, 18). For crystallization, the bc1 particles were subject to an additional 15-step ammonium acetate fractionation to remove impurities; pure bc1 complex in oxidized form was recovered from the precipitates formed between 18.5 and 33.5% ammonium acetate saturation. Final product was dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.66 M sucrose to a protein concentration of 30 mg/mL and frozen at -80 °C until use. The concentrations of cyt. b and c1 were determined spectroscopically, using millimolar extinction coefficients of 28.5 and 17.5 for cyt. b and c1, respectively. The homogeneity in the redox state of bc1 was confirmed spectrophotometrically. The fully oxidized bc1 was prepared by the addition of oxidized cyt. c (Sigma) followed by ammonium acetate precipitation, whereas the partially reduced bc1 was prepared by carefully controlling the amount of sodium ascorbate added to the bc1 solution. Redox state for cyt. c1 of each crystallization hanging-drop was checked prior to crystal harvest (Table 1). Purified bc1 complexes were adjusted to a final concentration of 20 mg/mL in a solution containing 50 mM MOPS buffer at pH 7.2, 20 mM ammonium acetate, 20% (w/v) glycerol, and either 0.1% decanoyl-N-methylglucamide, or 0.1% diheptanoyl phosphatidylcholine, or 0.16% sucrose monocaprate. This solution was set up for crystallization as

Structures of bc1 Complex with Bound Substrate and Inhibitors at Qi Site described in previous publications (10, 19, 20). Native crystals were grown in either sitting or hanging drops and appeared in 3-4 weeks. The antimycin A1 (from Streptomyces sp. by Sigma) or NQNO (Sigma) bound bc1 crystals were grown under similar conditions except that a 5-fold molar excess of antimycin A1 or NQNO was added to the protein solution prior to crystallization. Both native and inhibitor bound bc1 crystals had a rectangular shape ranging in sizes from 0.4 to 0.7 mm and were cryo-protected at a glycerol concentration of 30-40%. The inhibitor bound crystals were isomorphic to native crystals (Table 1). Partially reduced bc1 crystals were grown under anaerobic conditions under Ar gas. X-ray Diffraction Data Collection and Reduction. Crystals were stable at synchrotron radiation sources when cryocooled to 100 K, allowing collection of complete data sets during several hours of X-ray exposure. Data used in this study were collected on an ADSC CCD detector at the beamline X9B of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) of the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), with a wavelength of 1.0 Å for the native and for the antimycin A1 bound crystals. The NQNO data sets were collected on a MarCCD detector with a wavelength of 1.2 Å at the IMCA beamline, Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Lab (ANL). Raw diffraction frames were processed with DENZO, and integrated intensities were merged and scaled with SCALEPACK; both programs are part of the HKL package (21). Statistics for the quality of the diffraction data sets are provided in Table 1. Data Analysis, Structure Refinement and Modeling. Programs from the CCP4 package (22) were used for merging and scaling different data sets, calculating structure factors from atomic models, performing density modifications, and computing Fourier maps. Structure refinements for the native and inhibitor bound crystals were carried out with the program REFMAC (23), using the atomic coordinates of the 2.2 Å resolution bc1 structure (9) as a phasing model followed by iterative maximum likelihood positional and TLS (translation, libration, and screw tensor) refinement against respective diffraction data sets. The coordinates of antimycin A1 (12) and NQNO (unpublished result) were obtained crystallographically, and the models were fitted initially into isomorphous difference electron density maps calculated between the respective complex and the native data set and subsequently refined. Omit maps were calculated with refined phases obtained by omitting either bound ligand or associated water molecules from the coordinates followed by maximum likelihood positional and TLS refinement. Between REFMAC refinement cycles, A weighted 2mFo-DFc, mFo-DFc, and F+-F- maps were calculated (24) and used for model corrections, identifying new structural features and solvent molecules in the program O (25). Statistics on qualities, completeness, and number of assigned solvent molecules of the refined bc1 models is given in Table 1. Molscript (26), Bobscript (27), and Povray (www.povray.com) interfaced with GL-render (Esser, L., unpublished results) were used for atomic modeling and the molecular graphics presentation.

FIGURE 1: Ribbon presentation of the cyt. b subunit of bc1. The subunit is oriented with the matrix side at the bottom of the page and the intermembrane space (IMS) on the top. The mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) is roughly delineated with the two parallel lines in brown. The eight TM helices are labeled A-H. Four prominent surface loops are labeled as AB, CD, DE, and EF. The helices within the surface loops are labeled as ab, cd1, cd2, and ef. The two substrate binding pockets, Qo and Qi, are defined by cavity maps (49), portrayed in GRASP surfaces (50), and as labeled. The two intercalating hemes, bL and bH, are rendered as the ball-andstick models with carbon atoms in yellow, nitrogen in blue, oxygen in red, and iron in orange. The 2Fe-2S cluster from subunit ISP is shown as balls with sulfur in yellow and iron in orange.

eight membrane-spanning helices named sequentially from A to H with both the N- and the C-terminus located in the mitochondrial matrix (Figure 1). The eight helices are arranged in two helical bundles, one consisting of helices A-E and the other of helices F-H (10). The bL and bH hemes are incorporated into the first helical bundle and liganded by conserved histidine residues (His83 and His182 for the bL, His97 and His196 for the bH). Among the seven extra-membrane loops that link pairs of TM helices, four are prominent: they are the AB, CD, DE, and EF loops with the DE loop being the only one on the matrix side. These large loops are perhaps most important to the function of cyt. b as they are the primary participants in the formation of the Qo and Qi site. The AB and EF loop each contain one helix, namely, ab and ef; the CD loop has two helices, cd1 and cd2, in a hairpin arrangement; and the DE loop has no secondary structure element. While making contacts at the matrix side of the membrane, the two helical bundles separate from each other near the intermembrane space side of the membrane, thus creating the so-called Qo pocket between the bL heme and the 2Fe-2S cluster of ISP (Figure 1). The Qi pocket is located near the matrix side of the membrane with its entrance open to the center of the membrane bilayer. From the entrance, the cavity dives nearly vertically toward the matrix side of the membrane and is surrounded by residues from transmembrane helices A (Trp31, Asn32, Gly34, Ser35), D (Ala193, Met194, Leu197, His201), and E (Tyr224, Lys227, Asp228); the amphipathic surface helix a (Phe18); the A loop (Ile27); the DE loop (Ser205, Phe220); and atoms from the high-potential heme bH (CMB, CMA, and one of the propionate side chains). These residues are identified by their interactions with the bound antimycin A1 (Figure 2A), NQNO (Fgiure 2B), and substrate ubiqinone

(Figure 2C) in the cyt. b subunit. Among these residues, Ser35, His201, Lys227, Asp228, and Ser205 are highly conserved (Figure 3) and located near the bottom of the pocket. The Qi pocket has a hydrophobic entrance but turns progressively hydrophilic inward; it has the dimensions of roughly 7 × 10 × 13 Å and is potentially capable of accessing the mitochondrial matrix through the conserved residues His201 and Lys227 (see Discussion). Binding Interaction of Antimycin A1 with Cyt. b. The isomorphous difference electron density map calculated with Fourier coefficients between the antimycin A1 bound and native bc1 crystal showed a strong, well-defined peak in the Qi pocket over 10 above the mean and with the characteristic shape of antimycin A1. Antimycin A1 consists of three parts (Figure 4A,B): a nine-member puckered dilactone ring in the middle, a 3-formylamino salicylic acid (3-FASA) group that connects to the dilactone ring through an amide

bond, and a hydrophobic tail on the other side of the dilactone ring comprised of a hexyl and a 1-methyl butanoate chain. In the complex with bc1, antimycin A1 penetrates deep into the Qi pocket with the 3-FASA group making a network of six H-bonds and one Ar-Ar interaction (Figure 2A). Atoms OD1 and OD2 of Asp228 are 3.0 and 2.2 Å from the amide N1 and 3-FASA hydroxyl oxygen of the antimycin A1, respectively. Atom OG of Ser35 is 2.6 and 2.9 Å, respectively, from the carbonyl oxygens O3 and O7 of the dilactone ring. Two water molecules, 2.8 Å apart and stabilized by the NE2 atom of the His201 (2.6 Å) and carbonyl oxygen of Ala17 (2.3 Å), respectively, each form a H-bond with atom N2 of the salicyl amide group (2.4 and 3.7 Å, respectively). Lys227 is 3.4 Å from the terminal carbonyl oxygen of the 3-FASA group. Phe220 has an edge-to-face distance to the 3-FASA ring of 3.1 Å, forming an Ar-Ar pair (9). One of the bH heme's propionates curves away from the heme porphyrin

9072 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 30, 2003 plane, forming an ion pair with the Arg100 and whose hydrophobic side chain stabilizes the 3-FASA by van der Waals interactions (Figure 2A). Additionally, there are a number of van der Waals contacts between the bound antimycin A1 and its protein environment: deep inside the pocket the residues Ile27, Trp31, Asn32, and Phe224 are in contact with the formyl group of the 3-FASA; at the entrance of the Qi pocket, the dilactone ring makes contacts with Phe28, Gly38, Leu197, and the bH heme. The 1-methyl butanoate tail is near the entrance of the Qi pocket in contact with Met194 and Met190, whereas the disordered hexyl tail remains outside the Qi pocket with no contact with the cyt. b subunit. Binding Interaction of NQNO with Cyt. b. Isomorphous difference electron density calculated with Fourier coefficients of FoNQNO-Fcnat, where FoNQNO and Fcnat are the structure factor amplitudes for the NQNO bound and for the calculated native bc1 crystal, respectively, showed a flat triangular shaped electron density at the Qi pocket inserted in the space between residues Asp228 and His201. The NQNO molecule was best modeled into the density with the N-oxide oxygen near the carboxylate group of Asp228 and the hydroxyl group close to the His201. The hydrophobic tail of NQNO except for the first two carbon atoms was not visible (Figure 2B). Two residues are in H-bonding distance from the inhibitor: the carboxylate group of Asp228 is 2.9 Å from the N-oxide of NQNO; the OG of Ser205 is 3.2 Å from the hydroxyl group of NQNO. The imidazole ring of His201 is not in the right orientation to form H-bonds with the bound inhibitor despite close proximity. The edge of the phenyl ring of Phe220 is 3 Å from the center of the quinoline ring of NQNO, ideal for an Ar-Ar interaction (9). Additional interactions are contributed by residues in van der Waals distances from the heme bH, Phe18, Ser35, Leu197, Leu200, and Tyr224. Binding Interaction of Ubiquinone with Cyt. b. The ubiquinone molecule identified in the native bc1 crystal was copurified and cocrystallized, which diffracted X-rays to 2.6 Å resolution (Table 1). In the refined structure, a piece of electron density was located at the Qi site of the cyt. b subunit more than 5 above the mean, into which a ubiquinone molecule with its first two isoprenoid repeats was fitted. The two possible orientations of the planar ubiquinone ring could not be distinguished from the shape of the electron density, and refinements with both orientations gave identical statistics (Figure 2C). The orientation of the ubiquinone adopted here is based on continuity of electron density at a higher  cutoff and consideration to the quinone reduction mechanism (see Discussion). The average B factor of the bound ubiquinone is twice as large as its immediate protein environment, suggesting a lower than 50% occupancy in the crystal. The quinone ring is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the phenyl ring of Phe220 and to that of heme bH; the former forms an Ar-Ar pair with the ubiquinone (3.0 Å), and the latter has the closest distance of 4.2 Å (Figure 2C). There are three H-bonds formed between the bound ubiquinone and the Qi site residues: the OD2 of Asp228 is 2.3 Å away from a structural water molecule, to which one of the carbonyl oxygens O14 of the ubiquinone connects with a distance of 2.6 Å; the NE2 of His201 interacts with the other carbonyl oxygen O11 of the ubiquinone via another structural

Gao et al. water molecule with distances of 2.2 and 2.6 Å, respectively. The existence of these water molecules was confirmed with omit map calculation, and their roles will be discussed in connection to the mechanism of ubiquinone protonation reactions (see Discussion). The O13 of the methoxy group is 2.8 Å from the OG of Ser205. The two isoprenoid repeats that were visible in the electron density are in contact with residues Phe18, Ser35, Gly38, Met190, Leu197, and the bH heme. Binding of NQNO to the Qo Pocket. A piece of electron density in the isomorphous difference map calculated with Fourier coefficients of FoNQNO-Fcnat, 5 in height and triangular in shape, appeared at the Qo site and was intercalated between the cd1 helix and the conserved PEWYF sequence in the EF loop just before the ef helix (Figure 5). Specific interactions of the bound inhibitor with residues lining the wall of the Qo pocket include a water-mediated H-bond with distances of 3.5 and 3.0 Å from the N-oxide of NQNO and the OE of Glu271, respectively, to the water molecule; and the hydroxyl group of NQNO 3.5 Å to the NE2 of the His161 imidazole ring, which is one of the four ligands to the 2Fe-2S cluster of ISP. The following residues are in van der Waals distances from the NQNO: Met138, Gly142, Leu145, Ile146, Pro270, and Phe274. Conformational Changes in Cyt. b upon Binding of Inhibitors at the Qi Site. Antimycin A1 is conformationally rigid with practically only one flexible dihedral angle bridging the 3-FASA group and the dilactone ring between the atoms C9 and N2 (Figure 4A,B). Superposition of the dilactone ring of the free antimycin A1 in the crystalline state with that bound in the bc1 complex showed a nearly 180° rotation of the 3-FASA moiety around this dihedral axis, thus gaining at least four H-bonds with the protein environment in the inhibitor complex. The nine-membered dilactone ring has limited flexibility and displays slightly different puckering when bound to the Qi pocket. Structure alignment between the native and the inhibitor bound cyt. b subunits produced an rmsd of 0.33 Å for 377 out of 379 CR atoms, suggesting an overall structural rigidity of the cyt. b subunit. Among the antimycin A interacting residues, four undergo significant conformational changes when antimycin A1 binds (Figure 6A): the hydroxyl group of Ser35 flipped nearly 100° around 1 forming two H-bonds with the bound antimycin A1; the imidazole ring of His201 is rotated 110° around 2; the phenyl group of Phe18 is rotated 90° around 1 moving away for inhibitor entry; and the terminal methyl group of Met194 is rotated to accommodate the dilactone moiety of the antimycin A1. The heme bH, Phe220, and Asp228 have no detectable conformational changes between the native and the inhibitor bound cyt. b. The antimycin A1 molecule apparently binds slightly deeper into the Qi pocket and interacts with residues (Ser35 and Asp228) located on the same side of the pocket. Interestingly, in the complex the hydroxyl group in the 3-FASA ring of antimycin A1 occupies almost the identical position as the methyl group of the bound ubiquinone in the substrate complex (Figure 6A); likewise, the water molecule that H-bonds to the amide nitrogen (N2) in the antimycin complex occupies a nearly identical position as the carbonyl oxygen O14 of the bound ubiquinone in the substrate complex. Binding of antimycin A1 does not alter the anomalous signals of the iron atoms for bL, bH, c1, and 2Fe-2S (Table 2).

a The two native and the one antimycin A data sets were collected 1 at a wavelength of 1.0 Å, and both NQNO data sets were collected at a wavelength of 1.2 Å. All anomalous difference maps were calculated with reflections in the resolution range between 40 and 4.5 Å. b Variances is defined as [(x - x)2]/N, where x is the mean peak i height.

Superposition of cyt. b subunits between the native and the NQNO bound gave rise to a rmsd of 0.40 Å for 378 residues. The N-hydroxy pyridone ring of the bound NQNO largely overlaps with the ubiquinone ring found in the substrate complex, and the two ring planes are slightly off by <5° (Figure 6B). Conformational changes observed for the Qi site residues as a result of the NQNO binding are very limited when compared to the native bc1 with bound ubiquinone. Large changes include that the 1 angle of Asp228 is rotated by more than 30° and the position of the His201 residue is moved by nearly 1 Å.

Conformational Changes Near the Qo Pocket upon NQNO Binding. The rmsd from the alignment of cyt. b subunits between the native and the NQNO bound (0.40 Å) was larger than that between the native and the antimycin A1 (0.33 Å), even though conformational variations around the Qi site appeared minimal. However, large conformational changes were observed for residues in the Qo pocket when NQNO was bound (Figure 6C). The cd1 helix and part of the EF loop including the conserved PEWY sequence underwent significant displacement in opposite directions, opening up a seam in the Qo pocket and letting the NQNO headgroup sneak in to form an H-bond with the His161 of ISP. The side chain of Glu271 swung 180° around the dihedral angle 1 to form an H-bond with the N-oxide oxygen of the bound NQNO via a structural water molecule. Observed conformational changes in the inhibitor complex upon NQNO binding were not limited locally to the residues interacting with the inhibitor. Conformational arrest of the ISP induced by NQNO binding was observed in both diffraction data sets we collected (Table 2). Top peaks representing iron atoms in the bc1 crystals in anomalous difference maps were calculated for the native with and without substrate, with bound antimycin A1, and with NQNO; peak heights were normalized to that of the bH heme iron, and the variance for each type of iron was given. Clearly, binding of NQNO forced the ISP subunit to undergo a binary conformational switch from a loose to a fixed state.

DISCUSSION Structural Basis of High Affinity Binding of Antimycin A. Among specific inhibitors of bc1 complexes, antimycin A

has the highest binding affinity (6), which is reflected by its low thermal motion observed crystallographically. The mean B values for the bound antimycin A are 36.8 and 41.6 Å2, respectively, for the 26 ordered atoms and for the entire

Structures of bc1 Complex with Bound Substrate and Inhibitors at Qi Site molecule (39 atoms). As a comparison, the mean B value for the cytochrome b subunit is 34.6 Å2, consistent with high affinity binding of antimycin A. The use of various chemically modified antimycin A derivatives identified the following important structural features: first, among the five chiral centers in the dilactone ring, the S configuration for atom C9, through which the 3-FASA group is attached, rendered it 100-fold more potent (28). Second, the shape of antimycin A is strictly recognized by the Qi pocket; the salicylic acid moiety appeared to be more important than the dilactone ring for binding (29, 30). An intramolecular H-bond between the phenolic OH (O2) and the carbonyl oxygen (O3) of the benzamide group is required to maintain the conformational integrity of antimycin A for inhibition; a 10 000-fold reduction in binding affinity was observed as a result of disruption of this H-bonding (31). Third, Nmethylation of the benzamide was shown to dramatically reduce binding affinity (1000-fold) (31). Finally, N-methylation of the terminal formylamino group showed a reduction of binding affinity by 164-fold (31). Prior structural studies of bc1 in complex with antimycin A1 (8, 10-12) identified the approximate location and orientation of the bound inhibitor in the cyt. b subunit but failed to adequately address the origin of antimycin A binding affinity. The available coordinates of antimycin A in complex with chicken bc1 (PDB 3BCC) showed two strong H-bonds between the 3-FASA moiety and Glu229 (2.4 and 2.8 Å) and a weak H-bond (3.6 Å) between the terminal formyl oxygen and Lys228, which is not consistent with extensive literature and the extraordinarily high binding constant. In our study, the initial model for bc1 was obtained from the 2.4 Å structure (9) and that for antimycin A1 was from the crystal structure (12); both the native and the antimycin A1 bound bc1 were refined to 2.4 and 2.6 Å resolution, respectively (Table 1). We consider that the structures of the cyt. b subunit of this work are more reliable. Unlike the severely distorted inhibitor molecule in the structure of 3BCC, the antimycin A1 molecule in our study maintains a rigid shape with only one variable dihedral angle connecting the dilactone and 3-FASA moiety (Figure 4B). The intramolecular H-bond between the phenolic OH and the carbonyl oxygen of the benzamide is maintained; as a result, the 3-FASA moiety is planar. The formylamino group is maintained coplanar with the rest of the 3-FASA group. In the complex, five strong H-bonds (distances <3 Å) and one weaker H-bond (distance <3.5 Å) are available for binding interactions in addition to one pair of Ar-Ar interactions (Figure 2A), consistent with experimentally observed high binding affinity of antimycin A. Furthermore, both amide nitrogen atoms are involved in the H-bonding interaction, in line with the fact that Nmethylations at these groups severely reduced the antimycin A binding affinity. NQNO Is a Dual Site bc1 Inhibitor. Most bc1 inhibitors bind to either the Qi or the Qo site but not both; it appears that binding of an inhibitor to one site with high affinity makes it less likely to be a specific inhibitor of the other. A conceivable reason appears to be in the differences in geometry and binding environment between the two pockets; it implies that the substrate ubiquinol/ubiquinone, capable of accepting and delivering electrons at the Qi and Qo site, respectively, should not be a good binder at either site, which is indeed the case crystallographically. NQNO mimics the

Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 30, 2003 9075

structure of the quinone/quinol molecule in such a way that renders it capable of binding to both Qi and Qo sites but at the cost of a relatively low binding affinity to either site. Unlike substrate quinone/quinol that can be either all protonated or deprotonated, NQNO maintains one protonated (-OH) and one deprotonated (-NO) group (Figure 4C). With this configuration, only one H-bond forms between the hydroxyl group of the inhibitor and the OG atom of Ser205 in the Qi site. The N-oxide group of NQNO, although close to Asp228, does not provide specific interaction. On the basis of crystallographic and NMR studies of the solid-state NQNO (data not shown, this paper) as well as similar compounds in the literature (32), the hydrogen atom is attached to the N-oxide oxygen rather than to the carbonyl oxygen. However, it is possible that in solution the hydrogen atom associated with the hydroxyl group of NQNO can be in equilibration between the two positions (i.e., the hydroxyl and the N-oxide oxygen (Figure 4C)). This alternative configuration (tautomers) would allow an additional H-bond to be formed between the N-OH of NQNO and Asp228. Similarly at the Qo site, when the hydrogen atom is associated with the N-oxide group, two H-bonds would be formed between the inhibitor and the Qo site residues. To confirm experimentally the association of the hydrogen atom with the N-oxide of NQNO in the complex, high-resolution X-ray diffraction data or a neutron diffraction experiment would be necessary. NQNO was known to be a Qi site inhibitor; its effect to the Qo site reaction was suggested but never clearly established (14). The crystallographic data demonstrated that NQNO is capable of binding to both Qi and Qo sites and is therefore a better quinone analogue. As a Qo inhibitor, NQNO behaves most similarly to stigmatellin in its ability to reduce the ISP mobility (Table 2), to form two characteristic H-bonds: one with His161 of ISP and the other with Glu271, and to cause identical conformational changes to the side chain of Glu271. Mechanism of Resistance for Qi Site Inhibitors. Antimycin A resistance mutations in the bc1 complex from various species were reported; when mapped onto the atomic model of cyt. b with bound antimycin A, all of them were located in the immediate vicinity of the inhibitor binding pocket (Table 3, Figure 2A) (33-38). Mutations 1 and 2 in Table 3 each cause the loss of two strong H-bonding interactions important to inhibitor binding. Mutations 3 and 4 would not only block the inhibitor from entering the Qi site but also hinder the entry of the substrate ubiquinone into the Oi pocket. Indeed, these mutations also display altered kinetics of quinone reduction (3). Both Glu228 and Lys227 are important for H-bonding to antimycin A and are 3.3 and 3.7 Å away from Asn32; equivalent mutation N31K in yeast (mutation 5 in Table 3) would disrupt the delicate charge balance at the site between Glu228 and Lys227 resulting in changes in available H-bonding donors and acceptors as well as in the shape of the Qi pocket. Phe220, conserved in most species but not in yeast, forms an Ar-Ar interaction with the bound ubiquinone and antimycin A1, contributing to the binding affinity to both and perhaps holding the ubiquinone molecule in a proper orientation for the ET reaction (Figures 2C and 3). Mutations at this position in yeast M221E,Q (mutation 6 in Table 3) would severely modify the shape of the Qi pocket, not only producing antimycin A resistance but also leading to a defective phenotype in ubiquinone

reduction (39). Lys227 is making an H-bond with the terminal formylamino group of the 3-FASA; the mutations K227M,I result in loss of the H-bonding. This mutation also leads to slow ubiquinone reduction since this residue in the cyt. b subunit with substrate bound helps to stabilize a water molecule (3.5 Å) that binds directly to the carbonyl oxygen of the bound ubiquinone (Figure 2C). Lys227 is also speculated to be a proton shuttle obtaining protons from the mitochondrial matrix (see following paragraphs and ref 17). In essence, the common mechanism underlying antimycin A resistance is through inhibitor exclusion either by dramatically reduced binding affinity (mutations 1 and 2 in Table 3) or by modification of the binding pocket (mutations 3-5 in Table 3) or both (mutations 5-7 in Table 3). Reported mutations that rendered NQNO or HQNO resistance are extensive; all are located in the immediate vicinity of the Qi pocket. When compared with the antimycin A resistance mutations, it is clear that the set of NQNO resistance mutations does not entirely overlap with that for antimycin A, suggesting nonidentical binding sites. Consistent with the genetic data, crystallographic observations show that some of the residues in the Qi pocket interacting with the bound antimycin A1 do not contribute to NQNO binding and vice versa. For example, Ser35 forms two H-bonds with the bound antimycin A1 but is over 4.6 Å away from the bound NQNO. Likewise, Ser205 H-bonds to NQNO but has a distance of 4 Å from antimycin A1. Mutations that render resistance to NQNO are given in Table 4. Two types of inhibitory mechanisms can be conceived: (1) steric hindrances by mutations altering the size and morphology of the binding pocket, such as mutations 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8 in Table 4 and (2) perturbation of specific binding interactions to NQNO either directly or indirectly as mutations 2, 5, and

6 in Table 4. In particular, the two residues that provide specific H-bonding interaction to the bound NQNO in our crystallographic observations were targets for mutations that rendered resistance. S205L,V would eliminate one of the two H-bonds. Asn32 H-bonds to Asp228 that interacts directly to the bound NQNO (Figure 2B), and mutations N32K would result in charge imbalance and disruption of the H-bond of Asp228 to the bound NQNO. Mechanism of ET Inhibition. Ubiquinone binding at the Qi site involves three H-bonds to the three Qi pocket residues Asp228, His201 and Ser205; the first two residues interact with the two carbonyl groups of the bound ubiquinone, respectively, mediated by two bound water molecules (Figure 2C). These highly conserved residues are also used for inhibitor binding forming specific H-bonds. Asp228 and His201 provide four H-bonds for antimycin A binding; Asp228 and Ser205 are used for NQNO binding. Therefore, one strategy for bc1 inhibition would be to compete for binding to these residues. The 3-FASA group of antimycin A mimics the shape of and occupies an almost identical position of the ubiquinone ring in the Qi pocket (Figure 6A). Instead of having one watermediated H-bond with the substrate, Asp228 forms two strong H-bonds with the bound antimycin A1; the H-bonding of ubiquinone with His201 is also preserved for antimycin A1 via the same water molecule. Antimycin A acquires three additional H-bonds via Ser35 and Lys227, whereas the bound ubiquinone has only one additional H-bond between one of the methoxy oxygens and Ser205. By using analogous binding geometry and providing more specific interactions, antimycin A is able to compete with the substrate for binding. NQNO, when compared with antimycin A, is a much weaker Qi site inhibitor with two H-bonds and one Ar-Ar interaction, similar to the substrate binding, consistent with

Structures of bc1 Complex with Bound Substrate and Inhibitors at Qi Site the fact that NQNO inhibition of bc1 was reversed by excess amount of substrate (40, 41). Our crystallographic data demonstrated that the NQNO is a dual site inhibitor capable of binding to the Qo pocket as well. The dual binding mode of NQNO illustrates yet another mechanism of bc1 inhibition, suggesting that the effect of the combined binding affinity of NQNO to both the Qi and Qo sites could be additive, even though the inhibitor interacts weakly to either site. Electron-Transfer Mechanism at the Qi Site. A model of bound ubiquinone at the Qi pocket was given in the PDB entry 1BCC, although no description was found in the related article (11). More recently, in the 2.3 Å resolution structure of yeast bc1, a ubiquinone (UQ6) at the Qi site was modeled and refined (16). Similar to what we found in the bovine bc1, the bound UQ6 has an average B factor twice as large as those of surrounding residues, most likely indicating a low occupancy in the crystal. Furthermore, the authors acknowledged the possibility of alternative conformations for the bound ubiquinone and postulated an H-bonding network that includes a protonated Asp229 (Asp228 in bovine) for UQ6 binding and possible involvement of His202 (His201 in bovine) as a proton donor. We reason that, to provide a suitable environment for the ubiquinone reduction and protonation, the Qi pocket must satisfy the following requirements: first, it should have higher affinity for ubiquinone than for ubiquinol. Second, it must have access to protons from the mitochondrial matrix. And finally, the protein environment must be able to stabilize the ubisemiquinone free radical (42-44). Structure alignment between the cyt. b subunits with and without bound ubiquinone gave rise to an rmsd of 0.24 Å; no significant conformational rearrangement was detected for residues at the Qi pocket upon substrate binding. The two highly conserved residues His201 and Asp228 are 9.8 Å apart, between which there are four water molecules forming a network of H-bonds. Apparently, binding of substrate ubiquinone would require displacement at least two or more of these water molecules. Structure superposition between cyt. b subunits of bovine and yeast bc1 produced an rmsd of 0.73 Å for 376 out of 379 CR pairs; the superimposed Qi pocket with both ubiquinones is given in Figure 7A. Most residues lining the wall of the Qi pocket are conserved between the two species except for the four: F18I, L21S, A23Q, and F220M, among which only the Phe220 is in direct contact with the bound substrate. In bovine, two water molecules each mediate an H-bond to the substrate from Asp228 and His201, respectively, whereas only one watermediated H-bond in the Qi pocket was seen in the yeast between His202 and the bound quinone. Significant conformational differences of equivalent residues in the Qi pockets between bovine and yeast are observed for two residues only, namely, the His201 and Lys227. The two 1 angles of His201 are roughly 90° away from each other with that of bovine being much closer to the bound ubiquinone (Figure 7A). Located near the bottom of the Qi pocket and existing in two different conformations, the imidazole ring of His201 could be used to fetch protons from the matrix. Lys227 is located at the bottom of the Qi pocket but on the opposite side of the His201 and can be modeled in two different conformations (Figure 7A). In one conformation, the terminal amine is <3.5 Å from the bound water molecule that interacts with both Asp228 and the substrate. In an alternative

Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 30, 2003 9077

conformation, illustrated in Figure 7A and observed in all refined bovine bc1 crystals, the amine atom is rotated nearly 180° to interact with Asp223 of cyt. c1, forming a positively charged cluster that interacts with the head ground of a bound lipid (data not shown) at the membrane interface, which could potentially be used as a channel for retrieving protons from the matrix. When the Qi pockets of bovine and yeast are aligned, the terminal NE atoms of Lys227 of the two species point to different directions (Figure 7A). A similar observation was made in the yeast structure by Lange et al. (17) for the Lys228 (Lys227 in bovine) that was proposed to form one of the two possible proton uptake pathways. Like that in the yeast structure, the ubiquinone in the bovine complex has an average B factor twice as large as those of the surrounding residues and could be modeled in two different ways without affecting the refinement statistics. One possible model has the headgroup of the ubiquinone in a similar orientation to that of yeast, whereas the other, giving rise to better electron density, flips the headgroup by 180°. Both models accommodate the two bound water molecules and therefore will not affect the outcome of the quinone reduction and protonation mechanism discussed below. However, it is possible that both ubiquinone conformations observed at the Qi site exist, as those described for the ubiquinone molecules at the QB site in the photosynthetic reaction center of Rhodobacter sphaeroides, where the headgroup of bound ubiquinone underwent a 180° flip and the entire molecule moved by as much as 4.5 Å as the complex experiencing the transition from the dark to light condition (45). In the sequence alignment of Qi site residues (Figure 3), His201, Lys227, and Asp228 are highly conserved. His201 binds to the carbonyl oxygen of the bound ubiquinone through a water molecule; Asp228 interacts with the other carbonyl oxygen via another water molecule that was stabilized by Lys227 (Figure 2C). Mutations of His201 and Asp228 led to a defective phenotype in heme bH reoxidation, suggesting that ET from bH to ubiquinone was blocked (46). Mutations of Lys227 were not lethal but significantly reduced the rate of quinone reduction. These studies demonstrated the critical importance of these three Qi pocket residues. On the basis of available structural, phylogenetic, and mutational information, we propose a two-water moleculemediated four-step mechanism for quinone reduction and protonation at the Qi site, which is schematically illustrated in Figure 7B. The structure of native bc1 without bound substrate is considered step I in Figure 7B, where the residues Asp228, His201, Ser205, and Lys227 are poised to receive a ubiquinone molecule. When a ubiquinone molecule diffuses into the Qi pocket, it is stabilized by three H-bonds; two of them are water mediated, which are critical in providing protons for the reduced ubiquinol. This is illustrated in step II of Figure 7B and represented by the bc1 structure in the presence of ubiquinone. Asp228 is deprotonated whereas Lys227 is protonated, each making an H-bond to a bound water molecule that is also in H-bonding distance to the carbonyl oxygen of the ubiquinone. The His201 is also deprotonated and makes an H-bond with the water molecule that interacts with the other carbonyl oxygen of the ubiquinone. Hydrogen bonds to both carbonyl groups of quinone would elevate the midpoint potential of the bound Q (Q·-/ Q) sufficiently high to accept the first electron from the heme

bH. When the second electron is delivered to the quinone radical as in the step III of Figure 7B, two protons, each from the respective bound water molecules, are transferred to the phenolic oxygen of the substrate, and His201 and Lys227 have to give up their respective protons to compensate for the water molecules. Subsequent conformational changes in Lys227 and His201 (step IV) will take place to allow acquisition of protons from the matrix side. The yeast bc1 structure would partially represent this conformation.

In the proposed mechanism, the two bound water molecules play crucial roles in substrate binding, proton transfer, and possibly stabilizing the quinone free radical. The water molecule associated with His201 is conserved in all refined structures from bovine bc1 reported here, from the famoxadone bound bc1 (9) and from the yeast (16). The water molecule bound with Asp228/Lys227 is observed only in the native bc1 as well as in the one with ubiquinone bound at the Qi site but expelled upon inhibitor binding. Crystallo-

graphically, the existence of the water molecules was confirmed by the omit map calculated for the quinone bound bc1 (Figure 2C); the temperature factors for the bound water molecules are given in Table 5 together with those for the atoms they bind to. It is clear that the magnitude of thermal motion for the water molecules is similar to the atoms in their immediate vicinity. In addition to the above-mentioned observations that favor the proposed mechanism, it was documented that the ubisemiquinone radical required alkaline pH to be stable in the Qi site (47), consistent with the assumption that both Asp228 and His201 should be deprotonated. Furthermore, electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments showed exchangeable H-bonds to the ubisemiquinone radical (48), suggesting that, in our model, the water-mediated H-bonding may be required for stabilizing the free radical. According to this model, the number of H-bonds between the bound ubiquinone and Qi site residues would be reduced from three to two upon substrate reduction, which would facilitate the product (QH2) release from the Qi pocket.
