A series of 4,4-difluoroisofagomine analogues were synthesized. These compounds were tested for inhibition of eight glycosidases. The 3R,5R isomer 1 is a new and potent inhibitor against b-glucosidase from almonds with Ki value of 1.2 mM. The influence of the gem-difluoromethylene group (CF2) on binding to glycosidases is discussed. It is concluded that only non-essential hydroxyl groups can be replaced by the gem-difluoro group and that in such a case (b-glycosidase) the change in inhibition is, interestingly, a result of the change in base strength.

1. Introduction Iminosugars and azasugars (polyhydroxypiperidines and pyrrolidines), which frequently are analogues of natural products, have attracted increasing attention for synthetic chemists and biochemists due to their significant biological activities. They often serve as strong inhibitors of glycosidases and glycotransferases1 and have a tremendous potential as agents to treat a variety of carbohydrate-mediated diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, AIDS, hepatitis, Gaucher's disease, and influenza.2 Among this group of inhibitors, N-butyl-1-DNJ (Zavesca) and N-hydroxyethyl-DNJ (Miglitol) have been successfully completed clinical trials for type I Gaucher disease and lysosomal storage disorder.3 Isofagomine (Fig. 1), which mimic the transition state of glycoside cleavage in its protonated form, shows a broad spectrum of strong inhibition against glycosidases, especially b-glucosidase (sweet almond).4 Noteworthy, it inhibits b-glucosidase, glucoamylase, and isomaltase more strongly than 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ, Fig. 1).5 Interestingly, isogalactofagomine, a diastereoisomer of isofagomine, also appears to be extremely potent against b-glucosidase.6 In spite of considerable efforts have been expended to develop iminosugars as potent glycosidase inhibitors, their lack of selectivity has been shown to cause problems and side effects in therapeutic applications.1a Modification of a known iminosugar inhibitor is

a promising strategy for obtaining stronger and more selective inhibitors toward a certain glycosidase of therapeutic interest. In recent years, employing this strategy, tremendous efforts have been made.7 However, rare reports have described the effect of electronwithdrawing groups on the iminosugars bioactivities, especially when electron-withdrawing groups are introduced in the piperidine ring.8 Recently we designed and synthesized gem-4,4difluoromethylated nojirimycin analogues, and found that the strongly electron-withdrawing gem-difluoromethylene group had an important influence on the inhibition of glycosidase.9 To continue our research on the fluorinated glycosidase inhibitors, herein, we first described the synthesis and biological evaluation of 4deoxy-4,4-difluoroisofagomine analogues 1­14 (Fig. 2). The design of 4-deoxy-4,4-difluoroisofagomine analogues 1­ 14 was based on the following considerations: Firstly, isofagomine and its stereoisomer isogalactofagomine are very potent inhibitors of b-glycosidase. The configurational difference between these two compounds at C4 is non-essential for the inhibition of almond b-glucosidase. It is indicated that C4 is a good position to modify isofagomine as a result to discover new b-glycosidase inhibitors. Secondly, the strong electron-withdrawing gemdifluoromethylene group would greatly affect the pKa of iminosugars, which could have some interesting consequences, such as increasing iminosugars selectivity toward a certain glycosidase.9 Consequently, we expected that the presence of a CF2 group at C4 of isofagomine analogues would change their biological activity and selectivity and led us to further study their structure­activity relationship.

2. Results and discussion 2.1. Chemistry Our strategy to construct 4,4-difluoropiperidine ring was mainly based on difluoromethylated building blocks 15 and 16 developed in our group (Scheme 1).10 Compounds 15 and 16 were prepared from 1-(R)-glyceraldehyde acetonide in 10 steps. Starting from compound 15, a series of 4-deoxy-4,4-difluoroisofagomine analogues 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10 were synthesized. Since any diastereoisomers of 4-deoxy-4,4-difluoroisofagomine is meaningful to evaluate its bioactivity and further investigate the structure­ activity relationship, the racemic diastereoisomers of alcohol 17 were obtained in quantitative yield by reduction of compound 15 with NaBH4 in the presence of CeCl3$7H2O. Treatment of alcohol 17 with benzyl bromide in the presence of sodium hydride and catalytic tetrabutylammonium iodide gave compound 18 in 98% yield. The conversion of 18 to the key intermediate diols 19 and 20 was achieved by the following two steps: (1) ozonation of alkene in dichloromethane/methanol at À78  C and (2) reduction of resulting dialdehyde with NaBH4. Gratifyingly, diastereoisomers 19 and 20 could be readily separated by column chromatography in 45% and 43% yields, respectively. Diols 19 and 20 were subjected to methylsulfonyl chloride, respectively, followed by cyclization of corresponding mesylates with neat benzylamine to afford piperidines 21 and 22 in 52% and 84% yields, respectively.11 However, when compounds 21 and 22 were treated with hydrogen in the presence of 20% Pd(OH)2/C or less active 10% Pd/C in methanol at rt, all of the four benzyl groups were removed. The selective deprotection of three benzylethers was carried out by treatment of piperidines 21 and 22 with BCl3 in heptane/dichloromethane at 0  C.12 Finally, the resulting alcohols were converted to target molecules 5 and 6 in

58% and 51% yields, respectively, over three steps by oxidation with NaIO4 and subsequent reduction with NaBH4. The target molecules 4-deoxy-4,4-difluoroisofagomine analogues, (3R,5R)-4,4-difluoro5-(hydroxymethyl)piperidin-3-ol 1 and (3S,5R)-4,4-difluoro-5(hydroxymethyl)piperidin-3-ol 2 were obtained by hydrogenation of 5 and 6 in the presence of 20% Pd(OH)2/C in methanol. The Nbutyl iminosugars 9 and 10 were obtained from the diols 19 and 20 by cyclization of corresponding mesylates with neat n-butylamine in five steps using similar procedure. Similarly, starting from compound 16, 4,4-difluroroisofagomine analogues 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12 were successfully synthesized (Scheme 2). For the synthesis of N-hydroxyethyliminosugars 13 and 14, the intermediates 33 and 34 were protected with benzoyl chloride, and the resulting benzoylates were converted to compounds 37 and 38 using similar strategy as described for preparation of compound 1. Finally, treatment of 37 and 38 with NH3/ MeOH afforded the desired iminosugars 13 and 14. The absolute configurations of target molecules 3­4, 7­8, and 11­14 were assigned by the X-ray crystal structure of compound 813 (Fig. 3) based on the known configuration at C5 that derived from gem-difluoromethylated ketones 16.10 Since compounds 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9, 10 are enantiomers of compounds 3, 4, 7, 8 and 11, 12, respectively, we can easily confirm their absolute configurations by comparison of optical rotations. 2.2. Enzymology The synthesized 4-deoxy-4,4-difluoroisofagomine analogues were evaluated to their inhibition activities toward eight glycosidases namely the b-glucosidase from almonds, a-glucosidase from baker yeast, and Bacillius stearothermophilus, b-galactosidases from Saccharomyces fragilis, Aspergillus orizae and bovine liver, a-galactosidase

from Green Coffee beans, a-mannosidases from Jack beans. All assays were performed at 25  C and pH 6.8 using the corresponding nitrophenyl glycoside substrates. The Ki values obtained are summarized in Table 1. The N-substituted compounds 5­14 showed insignificant inhibition of all eight enzymes at concentrations of 0.2 or 1 mM depending on the solubility of the compounds, which meant that Ki0 s were above those values. This is in accordance with previous results that have showed that alkylation of the amine in isofagomine impedes inhibition.14 Likewise compounds 1­4 displayed no or negligible inhibition (Ki>1 mM) against all the enzymes except b-glucosidase from almond and b-galactosidase from bovine liver. However toward those two enzymes the inhibition was competitive and gave the Ki values 1.2, 4270, 980, and 950 mM versus b-glucosidase and 165, 610, 2480 and 250 mM versus bgalactosidase (Table 1). It is known that the stereochemistry of an azasugar glycosidase inhibitor is crucial for its ability to bind the enzyme, since many hydroxyl groups are involved in the binding, epimerisation of a single hydroxyl group may change the inhibition level significantly.14 Stereochemical resemblance with the substrate is likewise crucial. Compound 1 resembles, through the stereochemistry at C3 and C5, D-glucose, D-mannose, D-galactose, and D-talose, while compound 2 resembles D-gulose, D-idose, D-altrose or D-allose. Compounds 3 and 4, being enantiomers of 1 and 2, respectively, resemble the corresponding L-hexoses. In this light, the inhibition profile of compounds 1­4 is understandable: compound 1 is a good inhibitor of b-glucosidase and inhibits b-galactosidase while the other inhibitors are weaker. The absence of a hydroxyl group at C2 is the explanation why mannosidase inhibition is negligible (Table 1).

Comparison of the Ki of compounds 1­4 versus b-glucosidase from almonds with literature values for isofagomine and some analogues (39­46, Fig. 4)7f,14 shows that the introduction of the gem-difluoride at C4 has a minor influence on inhibition (Fig. 4). Compound 1 is 10­15 times weaker than isofagomine 43 and isogalactofagomine 39, but is two-fold stronger than the 4-deoxyisofagomine 46. This means there is some positive contribution to binding from a hydroxyl group regardless of configuration that cannot be emulated by the difluoride, but that the difluoride nevertheless does contribute to binding since it is better than deoxy. It is also seen that compounds 2­4 are actually slightly more potent than the hydroxylated analogues 40­45. This can be explained by the wrong configuration of 40­45, which makes the removal of wrongly positioned OH advantageous at least when replaced with difluoride. Obviously the electron-withdrawing effect of gemdifluoromethylene group (CF2) must be crucial for the binding as it decreases the pKa of the amine in these compounds. By using NMR,15 we determined the pKa for 1 and 2 to 6.86 and 7.57, respectively. Comparing these values with the pKa of hydroxylated isofagomines 39, 43, 40, and 44 that are 8.4, 8.8, 9.2 and 9.4,16,17 respectively, we see that the difference is 1.5­1.9 pH units, which is substantial. This means that at the test pH of 6.8, compounds 1 and 2 are not fully protonated, while the other inhibitors are. In any case, the data show that when modifying C4 the change in inhibition is not simply a product of changing pKa: the pKa values of 1, 43, 39, and 46 are 6.86, 8.8, 8.4, and 9.0 while pKi values are 5.9, 7.0, 7.0, and 5.6, respectively. The pH dependency of the inhibition of b-glucosidase by 1 was determined and is shown in Chart 1. The data show a very sharp curve with a maximum of inhibition located at pH 6.8, which is identical to pKa. In contrast to the gem-4,4-difluoromethylated

nojirimicin derivatives that have the unprotonated form as the most active inhibitor form,9 no such information can be extracted here. Both unprotonated and protonated forms may be active. The data are consistent either with protonated inhibitor binding to

monoprotonated enzyme (the active form) or protonated inhibitor binding to unprotonated (inactive) enzyme. From the pKa values the stereochemical substituent constant of an axial fluorine in the g position of the ring atom can be predicted, which is useful for empirical pKa predictions.16,17 From the pKa of 1 and 2 we can calculate a constant of s¼1.2, which is a difference of 0.2 from the value of a fluorine atom in the equatorial position.17

In summary, 4-deoxy-4,4-difluoroisofagomine analogues 1­14 were synthesized. The biological evaluation showed that (3R,5R)4,4-difluoro-5-(hydroxymethyl)piperidin-3-ol 1 was a good inhibitor of b-glucosidase from almonds, while alkylated or stereoisomeric analogues were significantly weaker. This is however similar to the behavior of isofagomine. The work shows that when a hydroxyl group is unessential it can be replaced by the gemdifluoro with minor change or even increase in the inhibition. The pH dependence of enzyme activity and inhibition study shows that the strong electron-withdrawing effect of gem-difluoromethylene group indeed decreases the pKa value of compound 1 significantly. There may be cases where such a modulation will be advantageous.

4. Experimental section 4.1. General 4.1.1. Chemistry All reagents were used as received from commercial sources, unless specified otherwise, or prepared as described in the literature. THF was distilled from sodium and benzophenone. Dichloromethane was distilled from calcium hydride. Petroleum ether refers to the fraction of light petroleum ether with bp 60­ 90  C. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AM300, Bruker AM-400 or Varian Mercury-300 spectrometers. 19F NMR was recorded on a Bruker AM-300 spectrometer (FCCl3 as outside standard and low field is positive). Chemical shifts (d) are reported in parts per million, and coupling constants (J) are in hertz. Optical rotations were measured using a Perkin­Elmer 241 or 341 polarimeter. Crystallographic data were analyzed with Rigaku FCR Diffractimer. All melting points are uncorrected. 4.1.2. Enzyme inhibition Each glycosidase assay was performed by preparing eight 2 mL samples in cuvettes, containing 1 mL sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M) of right pH along with 0.04­0.80 mL of different substrates. The concentration of the substrate was in the range of 0.25­5 Km.

The substrates used were 2-nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside, 4-nitrophenyl-a-D-galactopyranoside, 4-nitrophenyl-b-D-glucopyranoside, 4-nitrophenyl-a-D-glucopyranoside, or 4-nitrophenyl-a-Dmannopyranoside. Also added was 0.02­0.1 mL of a solution of either the inhibitor or water, and finally each cuvette was filled up to a total volume of 1.9 mL with distilled water. Four of the samples contained the inhibitor at a fixed concentration but with varying concentrations of nitrophenyl glycoside. The other four samples contained no inhibitor, but also varying concentrations of nitrophenyl glycoside. Finally the reaction was started by adding 0.1 mL of a diluted solution of enzyme solution. The formation of 4- or 2nitrophenol was monitored for 2 min at 25  C by measurement of the absorbance at 400 nm. Initial velocities were calculated from the slopes from each reaction and used to construct two Hanes plots ([S]/v vs [S]), one with and one without inhibitor, which also was used to check whether inhibition was competitive. From the two Michaelis­Menten constants, Km and Km0 , thus obtained, the inhibition constant, Ki, was calculated. All assays were performed at 25  C. The inhibition constants (Ki) were obtained from the formula Ki¼[I]/(KM0 /KMÀ1), where KM0 and KM are Michaelis­Menten constants with and without inhibitor present.
