Structure of the C-terminally truncated human ProMMP9, a gelatin-binding matrix metalloproteinase
The X-ray crystal structure of the proform of human matrix Ê metalloproteinase MMP9 has been solved to 2.5 A resolution. The construct includes the prodomain, the catalytic domain and three FnII (®bronectin type II) domains. The prodomain is inserted into the active-site cleft, blocking access to the catalytic zinc. Comparison with the crystal structure of the most closely related MMP, MMP2, indicates that the conformations of residues in the active-site cleft and in the cysteine-switch peptide of the prodomain are highly conserved and that design of MMP9-speci®c inhibitors will be challenging. In common with MMP2, the MMP9 S1H inhibitor-binding pocket is large compared with that of other MMPs. One small point of difference in the S1H binding pockets of MMP9 and MMP2 may provide an opportunity to explore the design of speci®c inhibitors. The side chain of Arg424 in MMP9 is angled slightly away from the S1H pocket when compared with the corresponding residue in MMP2, Thr424. The secondary structure of the FnII domains is conserved between the two closely related MMPs, although the second FnII domain makes no contact with the catalytic domain in MMP9, while the same domain in MMP2 has a substantial area of interaction with the catalytic domain.

1. Introduction
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of structurally and functionally related zinc-containing enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix of the basement membrane (Woessner, 1991). Physiologically, MMPs are involved in normal processes of wound healing, bone resorption and mammary involution (McCawley & Matrisian, 2001). However, MMPs also play a fundamental role in a wide variety of pathological conditions including rheumatoid arthritis (Shaw et al., 2000), cardiovascular diseases (Spinale et al., 2000; George, 2000) and cancer (John & Tuszynski, 2001; Kugler, 1999). MMPs contribute to joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis by degrading the cartilage and bone (Jackson et al., 2001). The activity of MMPs is not only essential for the formation of atherosclerotic plaque, but is also important in its degradation. Dissolution of plaque may cause plaque instability and rupture, eventually leading to the clinical symptoms of atherosclerosis, unstable angina, myocardial infarction and stroke (George, 2000). Many studies have shown that MMPs play important roles in tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis in various cancer types including lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer (Yao et al., 2001), bladder cancer (Kanayama, 2001) and prostate cancer (Lokeshwar, 1999). Thus, inhibition of the enzyme action of MMPs provides a particularly attractive target for therapeutic intervention in these life-threatening diseases.

research papers
In recent years, numerous studies have shown the importance of MMP9 in cancer and atherosclerosis. For example, in colorectal, breast, prostate and bladder cancer, most patients with aggressive disease have increased plasma levels of MMP9 (Zucker et al., 1999). In advanced colorectal cancer, high levels of MMP9 have been associated with shortened survival (Yao et al., 2001). In cardiovascular diseases, MMP9 has been identi®ed in human atherosclerotic lesions and the enhanced expression of MMP9 has been linked to plaque rupture (Galis et al., 1995; Spinale et al., 2000). MMPs are divided into the following subgroups according to substrate speci®cities. The most widely studied of these are the collagenases (MMP1, MMP8, MMP13), gelatinases (MMP2, MMP9), stromelysins (MMP3, MMP10), a mixed subgroup which includes matrilysin (MMP7) and the membrane-bound MMPs (MT-MMPs, MMP-11). All MMPs are produced as proenzymes. Comprehensive sequence alignments (Massova et al., 1998) con®rm the generally conserved domain structure of a propeptide of approximately 80 amino acids, a catalytic domain of about 165 residues, a short linker region and a matrix-binding domain of almost 200 amino acids referred to as the hemopexin-like domain. Proteolytic cleavage of the propeptide is required for activation of the enzyme. MMP catalytic domains are characterized by high sequence and structural homology. These domains are /-domains with conserved binding sites for structural and catalytic Zn atoms and for two or three Ca atoms. The DNA sequence of MMP9, human 92 kDa type IV collagenase/gelatinase, was ®rst reported by G. I. Goldberg (Wilhelm et al., 1989). The preproenzyme contains 707 aminoacid residues, including a 19 amino-acid signal peptide. The human MMP9 proenzyme consists of ®ve domains. The amino-terminal propeptide, the zinc-binding catalytic domain and the carboxyl-terminal hemopexin-like domain are conserved throughout the MMP family. The ®bronectin-like domain cluster is also found in MMP2, while the proline-rich collagen-like domain is unique to MMP9 (Collier et al., 1988). MMP9 and the closely related 72 kDa MMP2 degrade type IV collagen and denatured collagen or gelatin. Both MMP9 and MMP2 contain three FnII motifs which are thought to mediate gelatin binding (Murphy et al., 1994). Recombinant MMP FnII domains have been shown to have signi®cant gelatin-binding activity (Collier et al., 1992; Banyai & Patthy, 1991; Banyai et al., 1994) and gelatinases expressed without FnII domains lack gelatin-binding activity (Murphy et al., 1994; Allan et al., 1995). The sequences for the small FnII domains are inserted into the sequence of the catalytic domain, but the FnII domains fold as separate units adjacent to the catalytic domain. The insertion of the FnII domains in MMP9 does not perturb the structure of the catalytic domain. Clinical trials of compounds with ef®cacy as cancer treatments in the USA, Europe and Canada have involved several synthetic low-molecular-weight inhibitors of MMP activity, including batimastat (BB-94), marimastat (BB-2516) and bryostatin among others. Coussens et al. (2002) and Wojtowicz-Praga et al. (1997) review the clinical trials and give structures of these compounds. Preclinical studies showed that

treatment of heart failure in animal models with MMP inhibitors results in less tissue damage and improved cardiac function (Li & Feldman, 2001). Limited clinical trials have been undertaken for rheumatoid arthritis (Jackson et al., 2001; Shaw et al., 2000; Elliott & Cawston, 2001). The results are equivocal, but inhibition of MMPs remains a primary therapeutic target in rheumatoid arthritis. Structural studies of MMPs have elucidated molecular details of many of the MMP family members. A comprehensive review of common MMP structural features can be found in Bode et al. (1999). To date, more than 50 crystal structures of MMPs have been published. These include full-length proMMPs, activated MMPs, catalytic domains alone and inhibitor-bound MMPs. The X-ray crystal structure of proMMP2 (Morgunova et al., 1999) includes the entire proMMP2 and demonstrates the conservation of the structure of the gelatinase catalytic domain with those of other MMPs. Protease inhibitors that can selectively bind to MMP9 are expected to be of value in treating a variety of pervasive and costly diseases. An understanding of the overall tertiary structure of MMP9 in general, and the catalytic domain in particular, will provide important information for the structure-directed design of new enzyme inhibitors. Therefore, a MMP9 construct was prepared that includes the propeptide, the catalytic domain and the three FnII domains and the crystal structure of this proMMP9 construct was determined. This is the ®rst crystal structure of MMP9 to be published. The structure is quite similar to the structure of proMMP2 with the exception of the placement of the FnII domains. Conservation of the residues that line the active site and conservation of the conformation of the side chains of those residues is high; however, the shape and size of the MMP9 S1H inhibitorbinding pocket may provide an avenue for designing MMP9or gelatinase-speci®c inhibitors.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cloning and expression

Two gene-speci®c primers of human MMP9 (Genbank accession No. J05070) were synthesized. Primer 1 (5H -GCAATTACTGATACCATGGCCCCCAGACAGCGCCAGTCCACCCTTG-3H ) incorporates sequences for a unique NcoI site and an initiating methionine. Primer 2 (5H GCGACGGCATCACTCGAGGTCGACTCAACCATAGincorpoAGGTGCCGGATGCCATTCACGTCGTCC-3H ) rates sequences for a stop codon and a unique SalI site. Using these two primers, a 1275 bp DNA fragment was obtained from both human lung and spleen cDNA libraries (SuperScript cDNA libraries, Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These fragments were digested with NcoI and SalI and ligated into the NcoI and SalI sites of the T7 expression vector of pET-28a-c(+) (Novagen Madison, WI, USA). Two recombinant plasmids were constructed and con®rmed by sequencing. They were termed PC-MMP9 clones 7 and 8, which were derived from human lung and spleen cDNA libraries, respectively.

cular cloning in this study was performed according to standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989). For expression in Escherichia coli, PC-MMP9 clones 7 and 8 were transformed into BLR (DE3) (according to the manufacturer's manual). For induction, a single colony was picked from a freshly streaked plate, inoculated into 10 ml LB containing 50 mg mlÀ1 kanamycin and incubated overnight with shaking at 310 K. 0.25 ml of the overnight culture was then inoculated into 50 ml fresh medium plus antibiotic and incubated with shaking at 310 K until OD600 reached 0.6±0.7. Samples were removed for the uninduced control. To the remainder, IPTG from a 100 mM stock was added to a ®nal concentration of 0.4 mM. During incubation, aliquots were taken at 3, 4 and 5 h following IPTG induction. Samples were placed on ice for 5 min and the cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000g for 5 min at 277 K. The supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was used for SDS±PAGE and Western blot analysis. The remainder of the cells were stored at 203 K for further analysis. For Western blot analysis, cell pellets were boiled in reducing SDS sample buffer, analyzed by SDS±PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then blocked with 5% non-fat milk in PBS and probed with polyclonal anti-MMP9 antibody (mouse anti-human MMP-9 Ab, Clone #7-11C; Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA, USA), followed by the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Finally, the protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Corp.).
2.2. Activity analysis

MMP9 enzyme activity was assayed by SDS±PAGE zymography using gelatin as a substrate. The proMMP9 sample was subjected to electrophoresis, without boiling or reduction, through a 10% polyacrylamide gel co-polymerized with 0.5 mg mlÀ1 gelatin (Novex, San Diego, CA, USA) at 277 K. After electrophoresis was completed, the gel was incubated for 1 h at 298 K in a 2.5% Triton X-100 solution, washed two times (20 min each) with water and then incubated overnight at 310 K in 0.05 M Tris±HCl buffer pH 8.0 containing 5 mM CaCl2. The gel was ®xed with 40% methanol and 7% acetic acid, stained with 0.25% Coomassie brilliant blue R250 and then destained with 10% methanol and 7% acetic acid. Enzyme activity attributed to proMMP9 was visualized in the zymogram as a clear band against a dark background.
2.3. Purification

of freshly prepared 8 M urea, 25 mM Tris, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5. The suspension was stirred overnight at room temperature on a stir plate at medium speed, then centrifuged at 26 000g for 30 min. The supernatant containing solubilized denatured proMMP9 was clari®ed by ®ltration using an AP15 pre®lter and a 1.2 mm PVDF low-protein-binding membrane (Millipore). The ®ltrate was assayed for protein concentration according to the method of Bradford using the Bio-Rad protein-assay reagent and bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as a standard reference. The denatured protein solution (200 ml, 3.4 mg mlÀ1) was applied at a linear ¯ow rate of 34 cm hÀ1 (3 ml minÀ1) onto a 2.6 Â 11 cm column of Source Q anionexchange resin (Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated in 8 M urea, 25 mM Tris pH 7.5 (buffer A). Following a wash to baseline OD with buffer A, bound proMMP9 was eluted at a linear ¯ow rate of 45 cm hÀ1 (4 ml minÀ1) using a 10 column volume gradient (580 ml) of buffer A containing 0.25 M NaCl pH 7.5. Column fractions (8 ml) containing proMMP9 were pooled based upon purity as judged on a 4±20% acrylamide Tris± glycine SDS±PAGE gel (Novex). The pooled proMMP9 protein (115 ml, 2.8 mg mlÀ1) was slowly added dropwise to a stirred room-temperature 10 l solution of 20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 1 mM ZnCl2, 0.7 M l-arginine, 10 mM reduced and 1 mM oxidized glutathione pH 7.5 to yield a 32 mg mlÀ1 protein solution. After stirring overnight at 277 K, the solution was concentrated to 4 l using a tangential ¯ow unit ®tted with an Omega 10K membrane (Pall Filtron). 1,10Phenanthroline was then added to 5 mM and the solution was further concentrated to 150 ml using a stirred cell ®tted with a YM-10 membrane (Amicon). Following clari®cation using a 0.45 mm PVDF membrane (Millipore), the solution was dialyzed overnight at 277 K against 5 l of 20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM 1,10-phenanthroline pH 7.5. The 150 ml dialysate was again clari®ed by centrifugation (26 000g, 30 min) and 0.45 mm ®ltration and then further concentrated to 50 ml using a stirred cell. The clari®ed concentrate (50 ml, 1.6 mg mlÀ1) was applied at a linear ¯ow rate of 22.6 cm hÀ1 (2 ml minÀ1) in two batches to a 2.6 Â 99 cm column of Superdex 75 preequilibrated in 20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl pH 7.5. 80 mg of pure monomeric pMMP9 was pooled based upon purity as judged by SDS±PAGE. The protein was further concentrated to 12.8 mg mlÀ1 using an Amicon stirred cell.

2.4. Crystallization

The E. coli cell pellet (31 g wet weight) was suspended into 250 ml of 25 mM Na2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl pH 7 (PBS) using a Tekmar tissuemizer and processed twice through a cell disrupter (Avestin, Inc.) at 69 MPa. After centrifugation at 16 000g for 90 min, the lysate pellet was suspended using the tissuemizer into 250 ml of PBS containing 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA and processed through the cell disrupter once. Following centrifugation at 26 000g for 30 min, the washed lysate pellet was solubilized using the tissuemizer into 200 ml

Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in sitting drops. Drops were prepared by mixing equal amounts of the protein solution at 12.8 mg mlÀ1 in 20 mM Tris pH 8.2, 100 mM NaCl with mother liquor consisting of 4.3 M NaCl, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0 and placed over a reservoir of mother liquor at 293 K. Crystals grew in 3 d to dimensions of 0.1 Â 0.1 Â 0.25 mm. Crystals grew as hexagons in space group P65, with unit-cell Ê Ê parameters a = b = 123.7, c = 89.9 A, and diffracted to 2.5 A with synchrotron radiation. There is one molecule per asymmetric unit and the unit cell has a solvent content of 70.7%.

2.6. Structure solution

The positions of the Zn atoms were identi®ed using the software package SOLVE (Terwilliger & Berendzen, 1999) Ê using all data to 2.5 A and ignoring any contribution Ir atoms might make to scattering at the wavelengths used for the MAD data collection. The SOLVE solution was unambiguous, with a Z score of 49 and a mean ®gure of merit of 0.33. Owing to the high solvent content of the crystals, solvent ¯attening as implemented in the program DM (Cowtan, 1994) resulted in a substantial improvement in map quality. SOLVE and DM were run in space groups P65 and P61 to determine the correct space group of the crystal.

The cell pellets, collected from 100 ml of cell culture, were resolved on 15% SDS±PAGE gels and processed with Coomassie brilliant blue staining (a; samples taken at 0, 3, 4 and 5 h) and Western blotting with anti-MMP9 Ab (b; samples taken at 0, 3 and 5 h).

Ê Data measured at the shortest wavelength, ! = 1.209997 A, were used for the re®nement. Electron density for the three histidines that coordinate each of the zinc ions was excellent and was immediately obvious by visual inspection of the DM electron-density map calculated in space group P65. Using the graphics-display program O (Jones et al., 1991), the X-ray crystal structure of MMP2 was rotated and translated manually into the electron density until the histidines coordinating

the Zn atoms ®t into the electron density for those side chains. Most domains of the MMP2 model ®t well into the electron density, with the exception of the second FnII domain. The electron density was considerably less well de®ned for this domain, but was suf®cient to indicate the general orientation and placement of the domain. The model was re®ned using È CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). The structure was validated with the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Cloning and expression

A truncated version of MMP9 consisting of the propeptide, the catalytic domain and the three FnII domains was cloned for structural studies. The MMP9 construct was highly expressed, accounting for 60% of the total E. coli protein in 3 h post-IPTG induction (Fig. 1a). Western blot analysis using anti-MMP9 Ab (Fig. 1b) and SDS±PAGE analysis demonstrated a major protein band with the predicted molecular mass. A minor protein band with a lower molecular mass also appeared on the Western blot, which might represent a processed product of MMP9. SDS±PAGE zymography indicated that the proMMP9 construct is active (Fig. 1c). A substantial effort was made to produce a construct consisting of the catalytic domain alone. The gene was successfully constructed. Several different expression vectors and competent cell lines were tried for its expression. Nevertheless, there was no detectable expression of the desired peptide in any of the experiments, leading to the conclusion that the catalytic domain of MMP9, in its active form, may be toxic to the host cell.
3.2. Overall structure description and quality of model, B-factor distribution

The proMMP9 construct consists of residues 20±444 and includes the propeptide (residues 20±109), the catalytic domain (residues 110±215 and 390±444) and the three FnII domains (residues 216±389), but does not include the MMP9 collagen-like domain or the large Cterminal hemopexin-like domain. The structure is illustrated in Fig. 2. The three FnII domains cluster at the tip of the elongated catalytic domain, with the small propeptide associated with one side of the catalytic domain. The extended N-terminus of the protein reaches from an interaction with one of the three FnII domains up to the active-site cleft of the catalytic domain where the three helices of the prodomain are clustered. The overall average temperature factor for both the protein and the 230 water Ê molecules is 37 A2. Within the protein, Figure 2 the average temperature factors vary by (a) Ribbon drawing of proMMP9. The propeptide is in yellow, the catalytic domain is shown in red Ê domain from 29 A2 for the catalytic (strands) and orange (helices) and the three FnII domains are in blue, green and cyan. Ca atoms Ê 2 for the propeptide to domain and 37 A are shown as grey spheres and Zn atoms as black spheres. All structure ®gures were prepared Ê using the programs MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991) or BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997) and the 47 A2 for the three FnII domains.

Statistics for the re®nement are reported in Table 1. Electron density for the solvent-¯attened MAD-phased initial map was excellent. Fig. 3 illustrates the density for the histidine and cysteine side chains around the catalytic zinc in the initial map.

The propeptide folds into a small domain that is closely associated with the catalytic domain. MMP9 is activated by autoproteolytic cleavage of the propeptide in vivo or in vitro by reacting with an organomercurial compound or other proteases such as trypsin or chymotrypsin (Triebel et al., 1992; Okada et al., 1992; Morodomi et al., 1992). Disruption of the intimate interaction of the prodomain with the catalytic domain occurs when the propeptide is cleaved from the catalytic domain on activation. The secondary structure of the propeptide consists of a cluster of three -helices that lie roughly perpendicular to each other. The N-terminal nine residues of the construct are disordered, as is the loop connecting the ®rst two helices; these residues are not included in the model. The stretch of amino acids between the ®rst ordered residue of the construct, Val29, and the ®rst residue of the ®rst helix, Thr40, bridges a gap between the third FnII domain and the compact remainder of the globular propeptide domain. On the N-terminal side of this gap, the side chain of Phe31 is tucked against the hydrophobic side chains of residues Trp372, Phe379 and Trp385 of the third FnII domain as shown in Fig. 4. The backbone carbonyl group of Pro32 makes a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Trp385 Ê (2.9 A). Fig. 5 illustrates the stretch of propeptide residues 97± 99 that is inserted in the active-site groove between two relatively parallel stretches of amino acids (residues Gly186± Ala191 at the N-terminus of strand 4 and residues Pro421± Tyr423). Main-chain±main-chain hydrogen bonds are formed between the three short stretches of amino acids, effectively extending the -sheet of the catalytic domain (Fig. 5). The position of Cys99 within the active site to coordinate the active-site Zn2+ ion results in the active-site cleft being sequestered from solvent by the prodomain. Cleavage of the propeptide opens up the active site, facilitating interactions with substrate or inhibitors.

The catalytic domain of MMP9 is an example of a matrixin fold (Stocker & Bode, 1995) and is a slightly elongated globular domain with a diameter of Ê approximately 40 A. The domain consists of ®ve -strands in a twisted -sheet layered against three helices. Metal ions are closely associated with the -sheet, with one Zn atom above and one Zn atom below the plane of the sheet; Ca atoms are located at the ends of the sheet. Residues between the two layers are hydrophobic and for the most part aromatic. A number of the structural features observed in the MMP9 catalytic domain are conserved among MMPs (Fig. 6) (Bode et al., 1999). Among these are (i) a loop between strands 3 and 4 which forms an

`S-shaped double loop' that clamps both the structural Zn2+ ion and one Ca2+ ion in place near the end of the active-site cleft, (ii) the `bulge-edge' of the active-site cleft which includes residues N-terminal to and part of strand 4 and is involved in binding of inhibitors and peptide substrates, (iii) a conserved sequence motif HExxHxxGxxH, characteristic of the metzincin zinc-endopeptidase superfamily (Bode et al., 1993; Stocker et al., 1995) and partly displayed on helix B, (iv) conserved residues Pro421±X±Tyr423 which form the wall of the inhibitor-binding S1H pocket and (v) the speci®city loop curling behind the S1H pocket, residues Arg424±Pro430. 3.4.1. Metal-binding sites. Two Zn2+ ions, a catalytically important zinc and a zinc that plays a structural role, are conserved among MMP structures. The catalytic Zn2+ is located in the active site of the enzyme and is coordinated Ê tetrahedrally by three histidine side chains (2.1 A bond distance in each case), His401, His405 and His411, which are part of the conserved consensus sequence HExxHxxGxxH that curves around one end of the active-site cleft. The fourth ligand is the side chain of Cys99, the single cysteine residue in the propeptide. From one side of the active-site cleft, the side chains of His401 and His405 stick into the cleft from adjacent turns of helix B. From the C-terminal end of helix B, the protein rounds the end of the cleft and makes a sharp turn back towards the catalytic zinc, positioning His411 as a third ligand. The structural Zn2+ also has three histidine side-chain Ê ligands. His175 (2.2 A) is on the loop between strands 3 and Ê Ê 4, and His190 (2.2 A) and His203 (2.1 A) are on neighbouring -strands 4 and 5. The fourth ligand is the Ê conserved Asp177 (2.2 A). This zinc is sandwiched between the outer face of strand 5 and the S-shaped double loop that connects strands 3 and 4 and wraps back over strand 5. The orientation of these histidine residues relative to the two zinc ions is identical to that found in the proMMP2 structure. Three Ca2+ ions are found in conserved positions in many structures of MMPs, including MMP9. Each of the three Ca2+ ions has an octahedral coordination. One Ca2+ ion is located within the C-terminal portion of the S-shaped double loop that wraps around the Ca2+ ion. This calcium is ligated by sideÊ chain and backbone residues of Asp182 (2.7 A), Gly183 Ê Ê Ê (2.4 A), Asp185 (2.4 A) and Leu187 (2.6 A) and, in strand 5, Ê Ê residues Asp205 (2.4 A) and Glu208 (2.5 A). All but Asp185 are highly conserved residues among MMPs. A second Ca2+ atom is located near the ®rst Ca2+, at the edge of the -sheet, Ê Ê coordinated by Asp131 (2.8 A), Asp206 (2.5 A), Asp206 Ê Ê (2.8 A) and Glu208 (2.6 A) and by two water molecules. The third Ca2+ ion is primarily coordinated by residues in the loop Ê Ê between 4 and 5, residues Gly197 (2.9 A), Gln199 (2.5 A)

Ê Ê and Asp201 (2.5 A), as well as Asp165 (2.6 A) and two water molecules. 3.4.2. Active site. An important feature of the catalytic domain is the active-site cleft. In structures of MMPs, the active-site cleft can be ®lled with the propeptide, peptide substrates or inhibitors. The structure of the active site can be described according to the convention for proteases with respect to the sites on the enzyme, labelled S2, S1, S1H and S2H , that bind corresponding portions of inhibitors speci®ed as P2, P1, P1H and P2H (Schechter & Berger, 1967). Designations indicate both proximity to the scissile bond, with lower numbers closer to the bond, and location with respect to the substrate, the unprimed sites being towards the N-terminus of the substrate and the primed sites being near the C-terminal side of the substrate (Stocker et al., 1995). In the proenzyme structure, access to the active-site cleft is blocked by the cysteine-switch peptide (Van Wart & Birkedal-Hansen, 1990), a stretch of residues in the proenzyme centered around Cys99 coordinating the active-site Zn2+ (Fig. 5). Relatively parallel to each other and delineating the active-site cleft are the bulgeedge strand 4 (residues 186±191) along one side, the segment that forms the wall of the S1H pocket (residues 421±423) along the other side (antiparallel in direction to strand 4) and helix B which forms the ¯oor of the cleft. The propeptide (residues 97±101) runs through the active-site cleft parallel to strand 4. It ®lls the solvent-accessible portion of the cleft but leaves the S1H pocket empty except for a network of water molecules. The chemistry of cleavage of the scissile P1±P1H substrate peptide bond involves activation of a catalytic water by the catalytic Glu402 located close to the active-site zinc. Both the bulgeedge strand 4 and the wall-forming segment make extensive main-chain±main-chain hydrogen-bonding interactions with the propeptide strand within the active-site cleft. The size of the S1H binding pocket varies among MMPs and is determined by the conformation of large side-chain residues that line the pocket. The proMMP9 S1H pocket is large for an MMP as there are no sizeable side-chain residues occluding the active-site cleft. The MMP9 S1H pocket is primarily lined with main-chain carbonyl O atoms of residues Pro415±Leu418 and Tyr420± Tyr423 and the side chains of Leu397 and Thr426. In contrast, the shape and size of the S2H pocket is conserved among MMPs. This binding site is primarily shaped by residues Gly186±Leu188, a small loop at the N-terminal end of strand 4. On the other side of the catalytic zinc, the S1 site generally interacts with an extension of the zinc-binding group (Chen et al., 1999) and is in the relatively ¯at shallow end of the activesite cleft. Conservation of the backbone conformation for residues that de®ne the S1 site is high, although side chains vary among the MMPs. Analogous residues in MMP9 to those identi®ed as part of the S1 site in MMP3 (Chen et al., 1999) are Tyr179, His190, Asp410 and His411.
3.5. Structure of the FnII domains

Ê squares r.m.s. deviation of 0.7 A or less for 50 C atoms per domain. These domains have characteristic sequence motifs, which include four disul®de-bonded cysteines and four aromatic residues. The proMMP9 structure has the canonical FnII domain structure consisting of two double-stranded antiparallel -sheets that are oriented approximately at right angles to each other, with conserved aromatic residues clustered between the -sheets (Pickford et al., 1997). However, a slight perturbation in the conformation of one connecting loop, residues 260±262 in the ®rst FnII domain, results in a third parallel strand interaction in the second -sheet in each FnII domain. In the FnII domains, a cluster of aromatic residues forms a shallow hydrophobic surface. For the third MMP9 FnII domain, these residues are illustrated in Fig. 4. This cluster consists of Phe353, Trp372, Phe379, Trp385 and Phe387 and the pocket they form with the alkyl side chain of a highly conserved arginine residue Arg366 is ®lled by Phe31 from the N-terminus of the propeptide. The homologous hydrophobic surfaces in the other two FnII domains are each capped by two water molecules that bridge between the conserved arginine and one of the phenylalanine residues in the aromatic cluster. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the second MMP9 FnII domain has identi®ed Tyr320 in the hydrophobic pocket and Arg307, Asp309, Asn319 and Asp323 located around the pocket as critical for gelatin binding (Collier et al., 1992). Two of these residues are located on a ¯exible loop comprised of residues 306±311 for which there is exceptionally poor density and high temperature factors. In the proMMP9 structure, the three FnII domains are oriented so that the respective hydrophobic pockets are pointed away from each other out toward solvent. These domains have minimal contact with the catalytic domain or with each other.

3.6. Comparison with MMP2 and other MMPs

The three FnII domains cluster in an approximate trefoil arrangement at one end of the catalytic domain. The three domains have almost identical conformations, with a leastActa Cryst. (2002). D58, 1182±1192

The overall domain organization in proMMP9 is the same as that found in proMMP2. The structure of proMMP2 also included the hemopexin-like domain. In the proMMP2 structure, the large globular hemopexin-like domain has a small area of contact with the catalytic domain through an interaction with the loop between helices B and C at the C-terminus of the catalytic domain. It is uncertain as to whether the hemopexin-like domain of MMP9 would be in a similar relationship to the catalytic domain, since in proMMP9 the 20 kDa collagen-like domain is inserted between the hemopexin-like and catalytic domains. The prodomains of MMP9 and MMP2 are identical in terms of placement of the cysteine-switch peptide in the active site. The N-terminus of the propeptide has a slightly different conformation in MMP2, but the conserved Phe31 that inserts into the hydrophobic pocket of the third FnII domain is conserved in MMP2 and plays an identical role in that molecule. The linker region between the propeptide and the catalytic domain (residues Gly105±Leu114) has a different conformation in the two molecules; however, ¯exibility of that

comparable residues of the second FnII domains of MMP9 Ê and MMP2 are up to 21 A apart. With this relative rotation, the second FnII domain in MMP9 does not interact at all with the catalytic domain. In the second FnII domain of MMP9, the contact loop, residues 306±311, appears to be quite ¯exible by virtue of the high temperature factors for the loop and its patchy electron density. In both MMP9 and MMP2, the second FnII domain is involved in crystal contacts. The domain has an extensive interface with a symmetry-related molecule in MMP2 and a small interaction with a symmetry mate in MMP9. Temperature factors are around the average for the Ê protein for each of the MMP2 FnII domains, $23 A2, while the overall average temperature factor for the second MMP9 FnII domain is signi®cantly higher than the average for the full Ê structure at 52 A2. This compares with average temperature Ê Ê 2 for proMMP9 and about 42 A2 for the other factors of 37 A MMP9 FnII domains. Given (i) that the contact loop for the second FnII domain of MMP2 with the catalytic domain is ¯exible in MMP9, (ii) that the second FnII domain may be quite mobile in solution allowing an interaction of the MMP9 contact loop with the catalytic domain that would stabilize the structure of that loop and (iii) that these domains are involved in crystal contacts in both MMP2 and MMP9, there is no direct way to make use of the different positioning of the second FnII domain in designing inhibitors that would discriminate between MMP2 and Figure 7 Superposition of the propeptide, catalytic and FnII domains of MMP9 and MMP2 (dark grey).

In general, the shape and size of the S1H binding pocket varies among structures of MMPs and contributes to the speci®city of inhibitors.

The FnII domains of MMP9 and MMP2 have very similar conformations, but placement of the FnII domains is not the same. With the MMP9 and MMP2 catalytic domains superimposed, the ®rst and third FnII domains fall roughly in the same places, with the aromatic pockets oriented out toward solvent in each case. The second FnII domain of MMP2, however, has an extensive area of interaction with a loop of the catalytic domain, the loop between strand 1 and the ®rst helix in the catalytic domain. The interaction of MMP2 with the catalytic domain occurs mostly through one MMP2 FnII domain extended loop, residues 306±311 (MMP9 numbering). In MMP9, however, the second FnII domain has rotated and twisted slightly away from the catalytic domain so that when the catalytic domains are superimposed as shown in Fig. 7,

In MMP9 and MMP2, many of the residues that make up the active-site cleft and the portion of the propeptide that sit in the active-site cleft are conserved and the side-chain conformations of these residues are also conserved. Fig. 8 shows a superposition of the S1H binding pockets of MMP9 and MMP2. Differences in the active-site clefts between MMP9 and MMP2 are most noticeable in the stretch of residues that begins with residue 424 and continues into the speci®city loop that curves around beyond residue 397 and serves as the back wall of the S1H pocket. The only evident site for possible speci®city discrimination between MMP9 and MMP2 centers around residue 424. The side chain of the preceding residue, the almost universally conserved Tyr423H , narrows the opening of the active-site cleft, potentially protecting a portion of bound inhibitor from solvent exposure. The identity of residue 424 varies among MMPs. In the active site of MMP2, Thr424 lines the S1H pocket forming a boundary to the inhibitorbinding pocket. With the active sites of MMP9 and MMP2 superimposed by superimposing helix B and the histidine ligands of the catalytic zinc, the backbone and side chain of Arg424 in MMP9 are slightly translated and angled away from the active site when compared with Thr424 of MMP2. This Ê results in the C atom of residue Arg424 being almost 1 A further from the center of the active-site cleft than the C atom of residue Thr424 in MMP2. The remainder of the Arg424 side chain points directly away from the S1H pocket. Inhibitor-design studies will be needed to determine whether the conformation and position of Arg424 in MMP9 will allow the S1H pocket to accommodate larger P1H constituents than is possible in the S1H pocket of MMP2. Thus, comparison of the active-site cleft of MMP9 with that of other MMPs suggests that design of inhibitors that discriminate between the gelatinases and other MMPs may be feasible and that an avenue for structure-based design exists to explore speci®city between MMP2 and MMP9.
