CRABPII is a small, cytosolic protein that solubilizes and transfers retinoic acid (RA) to the nucleus while also enhancing its transcriptional activity. We have determined the first high-resolution structure of apo-wild type (WT) CRABPII at 1.35 Å. Using three different data sets collected on apo-WT CRABPII we have shown that apo- and holo-CRABPII share very similar structures. Binding of RA appears to increase the overall rigidity of the structure, although the induced structural changes are not as pronounced as previously thought. The enhanced structural rigidity may be an important determinant for the enhanced nuclear localization of the RA-bound protein. Comparison of our apo-WT with a mutant apo-CRABPII structure shows that mutation of Arg111, a conserved residue of CRABPII and a key residue in RA binding, causes structural changes in the molecule. We further investigated the structural importance of conserved residues by determining the structure of the F15W mutant CRABPII (F15W-CRABPII). Our structures also demonstrate structural changes induced by crystal packing and show that a crystal can harbor demonstrative structural differences in the asymmetric unit.

also been successfully used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL),2,6,7 a variety of skin disorders, human cancers and epithelial tumorigenesis.1,2,8­10 Developmental gene expression can be disrupted either by an excess or deficiency of RA. Much of the biological role of RA is due to its interaction with the RA receptor (RAR), a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor family of transcription factors. RAR functions as a heterodimer with the retinoid `X' receptor (RXR) and recognizes RAR-response elements (RARE) in gene promoters in a liganddependant manner to regulate the transcription of these genes.1,11­16 RA is a hydrophobic and insoluble molecule that must be solubilized and transferred to the nucleus, where it binds to RARs. Two homologous cytosolic proteins, cellular RA binding protein type I and II (CRABPI and CRABPII),17­19 solubilize RA, protect it from isomerization and regulate its effective concentration in the cell by either binding to excess RA and/or metabolizing RA in the cell through interaction with metabolizing enzymes.20­26 The fact

688 that CRABPs are expressed in tissues that are sensitive to high concentrations of RA supports this hypothesis.27 CRABPs are found in virtually all vertebrates.20 In embryos both CRABPI and II are widely expressed, although they are not co-expressed in the same cells.28 In adult rats CRABPI is widely expressed; however, expression of CRABPII is restricted to specific tissues such as skin,20 testis,29,30 uterus, ovary,31,32 choroid plexus,33 and hematopoietic cells.7,15 CRABPs are small (Mr  16 kDa), soluble proteins that belong to the family of intracellular lipidbinding proteins (iLBPs). This family is characterized by a well-defined -barrel formed by two orthogonal five-stranded -sheets that provide a large, deep and embedded binding cavity. Two short -helices act as a cap to the portal of the cavity.34 The two isoforms of CRABP are highly homologous in human (74% identity) and among species. For example, CRABPI and II in human and mouse are 99.3% and 93.5% identical, respectively. Higher sequence identity of the same isoform (CRABPI or CRABPII) among different species as compared to different isoforms in the same species indicates these two homologues should have distinct functions, which explains the conservation of their genes during the course of evolution.35,36 Although both CRABPs are believed to solubilize and transfer their ligands to the nucleus, experiments show that CRABPII enhances the transcriptional activity of RA,37 while CRABPI enhances the activity of enzymes that catalyze RA degradation and therefore depresses RA efficacy in the cell.25,26 In 1986 Takase et al. demonstrated that CRABPs are carriers of RA to the nucleus and chromatin of rat testes,38 and in 1998 Gaub et al. showed both CRABPI and II to be present in the nucleus.21 In 1999, Dong et al. successfully showed that the rate of transfer of RA from CRABPII to RAR is highly dependent on the concentration of RAR, and the process follows a first-order kinetically controlled mechanism. This finding indicates that CRABPII directly interacts with RAR and forms a protein­ protein intermediate complex to directly transfer or "channel" RA to the acceptor.39 In the same year, Delva et al. showed that CRABPII, and not CRABPI, associates with the RAR­RXR complex in a ligand-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo, and enhanced the transcriptional activity of the RAR­RXR heterodimer.7 Recently, Budhu et al. showed that although apo-CRABPII is mostly cytosolic, upon RA binding it is localized to the nucleus. This sensitized cells to RA-induced growth inhibition and enhanced the RA-induced transcriptional activity of RAR.36,40 Nuclear localization is believed to occur through the recognition of a nuclear localization signal (NLS). The NLS is a short sequence of basic amino acids that regulates the transport of a protein from the cytoplasm of the cell to the nucleus. Typically deletion of an NLS sequence abrogates nuclear

localization and frequently a non-nuclear protein can be localized to the nucleus by fusion to an NLS.41,42 However, the sequence of CRABPII does not have a recognizable NLS in its primary sequence,40 leaving the mechanism for nuclear localization undetermined. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of CRABPII nuclear localization upon ligand binding, a comparison was made between the structures of RA-bound CRABPII (PDB ID: 1CBS) and the R111M mutant apo-CRABPII (PDB ID: 1XCA), which was the only structure of apo-CRABPII available at the time.40,43,44 A significant conformational change was observed in the R111M CRABPII's structure, resulting in a significant change in the electrostatic potential upon RA binding. Most of this change was localized to a change in conformation of three residues, Lys20, Arg29 and Lys30 which upon RA ligation assume a three-dimensional structure that could be approximately overlaid with the structure of a classical NLS from the SV40-T antigen. In apparent confirmation of this hypothesis, mutation of all three of these residues results in a CRABPII that is less efficient in nuclear localization.40 However, the structural conclusions were made based on the structure of a mutant of CRABPII (R111M).43 Arg111 is a conserved residue in CRABPII (80%),45 and the R111M mutation results in a 45-fold decrease in the RA binding affinity of the protein.43,46,47 Therefore, its mutation may have a significant impact on the structure of the protein. However, since attempts in crystallizing the apowild type (WT) had so far been unsuccessful, the apo-R111M mutant was the only apo-CRABPII crystal structure available at that time. It has been shown that binding of the ligand to proteins in the iLBP family usually results in major changes in the structure of the protein.34,48,49 Chen et al. used their structure of the R111M mutant of CRABPII to address the ligand entry issue. Comparison of the RA-bound WT CRABPII to the apoR111M mutant CRABPII seemed to show that binding of the ligand is accompanied by major structural changes in the 2 helix, the C­D and the E­F hairpin loops of CRABPII. It was thought that these structural changes were necessary to open the binding pocket allowing RA entry. Further, a three-step mechanism of ligand entry was proposed, which consisted of: opening of the binding pocket, exposure of positive electrostatic potential that directs RA to the binding pocket, and interaction of three residues (Arg111, Arg132, and Tyr134) located deep inside the pocket, with the carboxylic group of RA to stabilize bound RA deep inside the binding cavity.43 To test the issues raised by Sessler et al.40 and Chen et al.,43 we have crystallized and determined the structure of apo-WT CRABPII at very high resolution (1.35 Å). We have also extended the resolution of the WT-CRABPII·RA complex (CRABPII·RA) to 1.48 Å resolution so that a more detailed comparison of the two structures can be made.44 In addition, we have determined the structure of F15W-CRABPII; to

Results and Discussion
Overall structure of apo-WT CRABPII Here we report the first crystal structure of human apo-WT CRABPII at 1.35 Å, refined to crystallographic R-factors of Rwork = 14.35% and Rfree = 20.05%. The structure is monomeric and has a P1 space group with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit, identical to that of the R111M structure solved by Chen et al.43 The two molecules are labeled Mol A and Mol B consistent with Chen et al. (Figure 1).43 Apo-WT CRABPII, like other iLBPs, has two  helices and a  barrel. The

barrel is formed by two five-stranded  sheets that are almost orthogonal to each other and form a deep, large and embedded binding pocket. The 1loop-2 motif and C­D and E­F hairpin loops form the portal of the pocket. RA binds deep inside the pocket, with only its ionone ring partially solvent exposed at the portal of the pocket.44,46 Complete diffraction data were collected from each of three different crystals of apo-WT CRABPII, Xtal1, Xtal2 and Xtal3. Since the structures resulting from Xtal2 and Xtal3 were virtually identical, only the higher resolution data set (from Xtal2) was completely refined. Data collection and refinement statistics for Xtal1 and Xtal2 are reported in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Analysis of Ramachandran plots is shown in Table 2 and is also discussed in Materials and Methods. Both structures show a similar secondary structure as determined by DSSP.50 Superposition of the

two structures (Figure 1) shows that the Mol A's are virtually identical (the overall RMSD between the C atoms of the Mol A's is only 0.198 Å). However, Mol B's in Xtal1 and Xtal2 show distinct differences in the loop region connecting 2 to B (residues 36­ 40), while 2 has an identical conformation in both molecules (Figure 1(a) and (b)). The overall RMSD value between the C atoms of the Mol B's is 0.689 Å. However, most of this difference comes from the loop region (residues 36­40), as the RMSD between the C atoms of these residues is 3.35 Å. Excluding these residues from the RMSD calculation gives an overall RMSD value of 0.26 Å. Therefore, although these crystals were grown from an identical condition and have identical unit cells and crystal packing, there is a substantial difference in conformation between two crystallographically identical molecules. Comparison between Mol A and Mol B of apo-WT CRABPII We refer to Xtal1 when comparing the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, because it has higher resolution and better data statistics. The two molecules have very similar structures except for structural changes in 2, the loop connecting 2 to B, and the C­D hairpin loop. There are also minor differences in the F­G and I­J hairpin loops (Figure 2). The overall RMSD value between the C atoms of Mol A and Mol B is 0.92 Å. The differences become noticeable at Lys20, located at the C terminus of 1 (xyz deviation of 0.920 Å), and increase moving toward the C

terminus of 2 and the loop connecting 2 to B. Ser37, in the middle of the loop, has a maximum xyz deviation (3.384 Å) between equivalent C positions in Mol A and Mol B. The differences decrease at the N terminus of B. If residues 20 to 40 (the loop-2-loop region) are excluded from the RMSD calculation between the two molecules, the overall RMSD value falls to 0.73 Å. The RMSD values for residues 20 to 40 is equal to 1.60 Å. As shown in Figure 2, in Mol B the C terminus of 2 moves toward the binding site of RA, and away from 1 (maximum xyz deviation between the C atoms of the 2 in Mol A and Mol B is equal to 2.953 Å at Ala35, the last residue of 2). Since residues on the C­D hairpin loop directly interact with the residues on the third helical turn of 2, the C­D hairpin loop moves concurrently with the movement of the 2 helix and away from the binding cavity. This movement of the hairpin loop causes the C terminus of C and the N terminus of D to move away from the binding cavity as well. The second helical turn of 1 shows some minor movement compared to Mol A. The maximum xyz deviation between the C atoms of 1 in Mol A and Mol B is equal to 1.247 Å at Leu21, the last residue of 1. The dissimilarities between the two molecules indicate regions of flexibility and must be due to different crystal packing environments for the two molecules. As assessed by the program CONTACT in the CCP4 suite,51 the 2 helix in Mol A is involved in three hydrogen bond and 16 van der Waals (vdw) contacts with neighboring molecules, while that of Mol B is involved in four hydrogen bonds and 59 vdw contacts. All three hydrogen bonds of Mol A involve interactions of the guanidino group of Arg29, located on the second helical turn of 2, with the carbonyl group and side-chain of Glu137 of a symmetry related molecule. In Mol B there are two hydrogen bonds between the guanidino group of Arg29 and the carboxylate group of Glu137 of a symmetry related molecule; however, there are two additional hydrogen bonds between 2 and neighboring molecules. One is between the carbonyl group of Lys30, located on the second helical turn of 2, with the side-chain of Thr131 of a symmetry related molecule; and the other is between the carbonyl group of Ala34, on the third helical turn of 2, and the side-chain of Asn14 of a symmetry related molecule. The additional hydrogen bonds and vdw contacts between the second and third helical turns of 2 in Mol B with neighboring molecules drag the helix toward the C­D hairpin loop. The C­D hairpin loop moves concurrently with the movement of the helix. Therefore direct crystal-packing interactions can explain differences in the structures of Mol A and Mol B in the asymmetric unit. In Mol A but not in Mol B, the guanidino group of Arg111 indirectly interacts with 2 and the loop connecting 2 to B through two solvent-mediated interactions. The paths of these two interactions

are shown in Figure 3 and are: (1) guanidine group of Arg111  water 204  carboxylate of acetate 4  guanidino group of Arg132  carbonyl of Ala36; and (2) guanidino group of Arg111  water 204  carboxylate of acetate 4  guanidino group of Arg132  water 33  carbonyl of Val33. Val33 is located on the third helical turn of 2 and Ala36 is on the loop connecting 2 to B. Acetate is one of the crystallization reagents and binds in the cavity by occupying the position of the carboxylate group of RA. The same solvent-mediated interaction exists in Mol A of Xtal2, but a chloride ion

occupies the position of acetate in Xtal1, confirming that the contact does not rely on acetate. Xtal3 has an acetate molecule exactly as observed in Xtal1. Arg111 has exactly the same conformation in Mol A and Mol B. However, Arg132 has distinct conformations in each molecule. In Mol A it faces the 2 helix and makes hydrogen bonds with Val33 and Ala36, while in Mol B it looks away from the loop and binds to the carbonyl group of Val76, on the C­D hairpin loop, and the oxygen of Ser12, the last residue of A through other water networks.

Figure 3. Solvent-mediated interaction between Arg111, Val33 and Ala36 in Mol A of Xtal1.

692 Also in Xtal2 and Xtal3, and not in Xtal1, the N nitrogen of Arg132 binds to the main-chain nitrogen of Lys38 through a solvent molecule (water or chloride). In Xtal1 the loop connecting 2 to B has a different conformation compared to that in Xtal2 and Xtal3 and therefore is positioned further away from Arg132 (Figure 1(b)). Thus, in Mol B of Xtal1 there is no interaction between Arg132 and Lys38. This observation indicates that since in Mol A Arg132 faces the loop and makes a direct and tight hydrogen bond with Ala36, it fixes the position of the 2 helix and the loop in this molecule. However, in Mol B it cannot make such a tight hydrogen bond with the loop and therefore the loop becomes flexible. The conformations of the residues mentioned above are identical in Xtal1, Xtal2 and Xtal3 (data not shown for Xtal3). But why does Arg132 have two different conformations in the two molecules? Different intermolecular interactions of the C terminus of 2 in Mol B as compared to that of Mol A eliminates the interactions of Arg132 with Ala33 and Val36 inside the pocket and therefore Arg132 assumes a different conformation to make a hydrogen bond to Val76 and Ser12 through different watermediated interactions. Changes induced upon R111M mutation Arg111 is not only a highly conserved residue,45 it is also one of the key RA-binding residues,43 and therefore mutation of this residue could potentially cause major changes in structure. Comparing Mol A of apo-WT to that of the R111M structure shows that the 2 helix and C­D hairpin loop are strikingly different in the R111M structure (Figure 4(a)). However, the 2 helices have identical conformations in Mol B of the two structures (Figure 4(b)). The major difference between Mol B of apo-WT and R111M lies in the

Crystal Structure of Human Apo-wild-type CRABPII

C­D, G­H, and I­J hairpin loops. The loop connecting 2 to B, residues 36 to 39, has a very similar conformation in Mol B of Xtal1 and the R111M structure (Figure 4(b)). It was reported by Chen et al.43 that 2 of Mol A in R111M is not involved in intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions resulting from crystal packing and makes only eight intermolecular crystal packing vdw contacts, while that of Mol B is involved in seven hydrogen bonds and 43 vdw contacts. Therefore, it was suggested that structural differences between Mol A and Mol B of R111M were due to the fact that the structure of Mol B is an artifact of crystal-packing while that of Mol A is the actual conformation of apo-CRABPII. However, 2 of Mol A and Mol B of apo-WT CRABPII are both involved in crystal packing hydrogen bonds and vdw contacts. 2 of Mol A is involved in three hydrogen bonds and 16 vdw contacts and that of Mol B is involved in four hydrogen bonds and 59 vdw contacts. As discussed here, in Xtal1 Arg111 interacts with carbonyl groups of Val33 and Ala36 through two short solvent-mediated interactions (Figure 3). These residues are located on the 2 helix and the loop connecting this helix to B, respectively. The network interaction keeps these regions tight at their place. Therefore, it is expected that mutation of Arg111 could allow the helix and loop to be mobile, and therefore cause major structural changes. Investigating the interactions inside the pocket of the R111M mutant shows that there is no interaction between Met111 and residues on the helix or the loop, which indicates that movement of the 2 helix of Mol A of R111M as compared to that of apo-WT must be due to mutation of this key residue. Also Arg132 has a distinct conformation in this structure from that in Mol A of apo-WT and has no hydrogen bond interaction with the helix or the loop.

693 bends toward the interior of the pocket and has a water network interaction with Arg132. Therefore, we believe that the three-step mechanism of RA entry proposed by Chen et al.,43 based on comparing the structure of apo-R111M and holo-CRABPII is not consistent with the structures of apo-WT CRABPII we have determined. Changes induced upon F15W mutation on the apo-WT structure To better understand the importance of conserved residues for the structural integrity of the iLBP fold, we decided to determine the structure of another CRABPII mutant. Among all 52 members of iLBPs Phe15, the first residue of the 1 helix, is a fully conserved residue (100%). Therefore, we decided to conservatively mutate this fully conserved residue to Trp and study the impact of this mutation on the structure. F15WCRABPII was crystallized and the structure was determined at 1.51 Å at crystallographic R-factors of Rwork = 17.15% and Rfree = 24.25%. Similar to apoWT and apo-R111M structures, the crystals were in the P1 space group with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The data collection and refinement statistics are reported in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Interestingly we observed that the 2 helix of Mol A is completely disrupted in F15WCRABPII mutant structure (Figure 5(a)). Though 2 in Mol B is well defined, this helix and the loop connecting 2 to B have a different conformation from that in Mol B of apo-WT and R111M (Figure 5(b)). In fact Mol B of this mutant has a very similar conformation to that of Mol A of apo-WT. Therefore, this structure provides further confirmation for the high mobility of this loop in CRABPII and also gives further evidence that mutations of

Chen et al.43 studied the conformational differences between apo-R111M and CRABPII·RA and suggested a three-step mechanism of ligand entry into CRABPII. This mechanism involved first portal opening involving unwinding of the 2 helix and motion of the C­D and E­F hairpin loops, where unwinding of the 2 helix was thought to be essential for RA entry. Three positively charged residues, Arg29, Arg59 and Arg132, were then thought to "direct" the RA carboxylate group into the binding cavity. These residues would then flip out of the binding cavity in the last binding step. Our structure of apo-WT CRABPII, however, is not consistent with this hypothesis because we do not see the same conformational changes between the apo and bound CRABPII. First, the 2 helix in apoWT CRABPII and the CRABPII·RA complex is identical in most of our structures, in contrast to the large conformational change seen in the R111M structure. Furthermore, both Arg29 and Arg132 have identical conformations in the bound and apo forms of the protein, indicating that conformational change of these residues is not required to direct RA binding. We conclude that in fact the most significant conformational differences between the apo-R111M structure and the WT-CRABPII·RA complex structure are due to the mutation of the very conserved Arg111 residue. Arg59, the first residue of D, located at the portal of the pocket, has the same conformation in Xtal1 and Xtal2 but is different from CRABPII·RA and R111M. In both apo-WT and CRABPII·RA, the side-chain of Arg59 is located toward the exterior of the pocket; however, in CRABPII·RA it is forced away from the portal of the pocket to provide enough space for the dimethyl group of the ionone ring. In contrast, in the R111M structure, the conformation of Arg59 is strikingly different and unlike other structures it

694 conserved residues in the iLBP fold can result in significant structural variance. This mutant is still capable of RA binding, though the affinity is significantly reduced (Kd = 40(±4) nM) compared to WT-CRABPII (Kd = 2.0(±1.2) nM).52 Overall structure of CRABPII·RA and comparison with apo-WT CRABPII We have also re-determined and refined the structure of CRABPII·RA to an improved resolution of 1.48 Å with very good crystallographic R-factors of 12.30% and 17.09% for Rwork and Rfree, respectively. The data collection and refinement statistics are reported in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The CRABPII·RA complex was previously crystallized in a different crystallization condition and the structure refined at 1.80 Å by Kleywegt et al. (PDB ID: 1CBS).44 Our structure is identical to the previously published structure of CRABPII·RA, with the same space group (P212121) and similar cell constants. RA binds deep inside the binding pocket and the carboxylic group of RA interacts

with Arg111, Arg132, and Tyr134. Only the  ionone ring is partially solvent exposed at one of its edges.46 As mentioned earlier, Chen et al. believed that Mol A of apo-R111M shows the actual structure of apoCRABPII and therefore chose Mol A over Mol B for comparing apo- and holo-CRABPII. Superimposition of Mol A of apo-R111M on CRABPII·RA showed that there were significant structural differences between the two molecules in the 2 helix, C­D and E­F hairpin loops, which were thought to be necessary for opening the binding pocket and making RA-entry possible (see Figure 3 of Chen et al.43). We compared the structures of both molecules of apo-CRABPII to that of CRABPII·RA to evaluate these hypotheses. Comparing Mol A and CRABPII·RA (Figure 6(a)) shows that in fact these two structures are almost identical (RMSD = 0.500) except in the C­D hairpin loop region. In the apo structure Arg59 on this hairpin loop, has a water-mediated interaction with the carbonyl group of Ala32, which keeps Arg59 close to the portal of the pocket and in the path of RA entry.

695 ends at Val33 and Ala36, located on the 2 helix and the loop region (similar to the network in Mol A of apo-WT). The path of the network, shown in Figure 6(c), is: (1) guanidino group of Arg111water 134  carboxylate of RA  guanidino group of Arg132  carbonyl of Ala36; and (2) guanidino group of Arg111water 134  carboxylate of RA  guanidino group of Arg132  water 28  carbonyl of Val33. In contrast, this water-mediated interaction is lost in Mol B of apo-WT due to crystal packing. The differences in Mol A and Mol B of the apo structures emphasize the increased flexibility of apo-CRABPII over holo-CRABPII. Comparison between the crystal and NMR structures The solution structures of apo-WT (PDB ID: 1BLR) and the R111M mutant (PDB ID: 1BM5) of CRABPII both have been determined by Wang et al.46,53 We have compared these two structures with the previously published crystal structure of CRABPII·RA, and showed that the structure of R111M is more similar to holo-CRABPII than apo-CRABPII in both structural and dynamic properties. 46 We compared these two solution structures to our crystal structure of apo-WT CRABPII. This comparison has shown that the NMR structure of the R111M mutant (PDB ID: 1BM5) is similar (with high RMSD of 3.56 Å) to that of apo-WT, which itself is identical to holo-CRABPII. However, the NMR solution of apo-WT CRABPII (PDB ID: 1BLR) is dramatically different from our crystal structure of this protein. The 1-loop-2 region and the C­D, E­F and G­H loops have significantly different conformations in this structure. Particularly 2 is completely unwound and has opened up toward the exterior of the pocket.50 These changes were thought to be necessary for opening of the pocket and ligand entry. However, we believe that since the ionone ring of RA is exposed at the portal, the ligand seems to find its way toward the interior of the pocket without requiring significant structural differences between the apo- and holo-CRABPII. In other words we believe that loosing the integrity of the structure, as observed in the NMR structure of apo-WT, should not be necessary for RA entry. Our three different crystal structures of apo-WT show that the apo- and holo-CRABPII are very similar and that the portal of the pocket is large enough to let RA enter the pocket without causing dramatic structural changes. In light of both the NMR structure of apo-R111M and of our numerous structures of apo-WT CRABPII, the NMR structure of the apo-WT protein is puzzling. In fact the structures of apo-CRABPI (PDB ID: 1CBI),54 apo-M-FABP (PDB ID: 1FTP),55 apo-IFABP (PDB IDs: 1IFB and 1IFC),56,57 apo-CRBPII (PDB ID: 1OPA) 48 and apo-ALBP (PDB IDs: 1ALB and 1LIB),49,58 the only other members of the iLBPs protein family with known structures, are also quite similar to our apo-CRABPII crystal structure and none display the extreme structural changes seen in the apo-CRABPII NMR-determined structure.

the holo structure RA pushes the mediating water molecules away and Arg59 moves away from the portal to give RA space to enter the pocket. Also Val58 on the C­D hairpin loop moves closer to the binding pocket to form vdw contacts with C19 of RA. It should be mentioned that the same interactions were observed in the published structure of CRABPII·RA (PDB ID: 1CBS). Although the C­D hairpin loop shows some minor differences, they are not as significant as what had been observed when the structures of apoR111M and CRABPII·RA were compared. Chen et al.43 had suggested that this hairpin loop opens in apo-CRABPII to allow RA entry and then closes when RA enters the pocket, while apo-WT-CRABPII does not show such a movement for the hairpin loop. The 2 helix has an identical conformation in both structures, which indicates that this helix does not change its conformation upon ligation contrary to the R111M structure. So the major differences observed when comparing the structures of apoR111M and CRABPII·RA were actually the result of the R111M mutation, not RA binding. Comparing the structure of Mol B and CRABPII·RA (Figure 6(b)) shows that the C terminus of the 2 helix and the loop connecting 2 to B are significantly different in the two structures. As explained above the crystal packing environment of Mol B results in the altered conformation of this region and we therefore believe that its altered conformation is an artifact of crystal packing. The conformation of the 2 helix in Mol B does not leave enough space for RA to enter and bind inside the pocket: the second helical turn of the helix is very close to where RA binds inside the pocket and its residues would collide with RA. Also Arg132 has a different conformation in Mol B than in Mol A and is also in the way of RA entry. Therefore, we believe that Mol A shows the "real" conformation of apoWT CRABPII (or at least the closest that we can get to "real" from a crystal structure) and is compatible with RA entry. Here using three independent sets of diffraction data, collected on three different crystals of apo-WT we demonstrated that apo-WT has an almost identical structure to CRABPII·RA with only minor differences in the C­D hairpin loop. This hairpin loop is at the portal of the binding cavity and tends to close up the opening of the pocket upon RA ligation (Figure 6(a)). It is interesting to note that very similar structures of these molecules, especially in the 2-helix and loop region correlate with the very similar solventmediated interactions in the binding cavity of both CRABPII·RA and apo-WT Mol A. This occurs because an acetate (Xtal1) or a chloride (Xtal2) ion replaces the carboxylate group of RA in the Mol A of apo-WT structure. This carboxylate or chloride serves to bridge Arg111 to the opposite side of the binding cavity, stabilizing this region. Both acetate and RA bind inside the cavity and form tight hydrogen bonds with Arg132 and Tyr134 (Figure 3 and Figure 6(c)). The network starts at Arg111 and

696 Comparison between the crystal structures of apo-CRABPI and apo-CRABPII Our apo-CRABPII is monomeric while apoCRABPI, unlike other iLBPs forms a dimer. In apoCRABPI five new hydrogen bonds are formed between the D strands of Mol A and Mol B, creating an intermolecular -sheet between the two molecules. The movement of the C­D hairpin loop of Mol A towards the exterior of the pocket was believed to be essential for the formation of the intermolecular -sheet resulting in dimerization. Further, it was suggested that formation of this 20 stranded double -barrel is essential for opening the portal of the pocket and may be the ligand entry mechanism in CRABPI.54 Our crystal structure of apo-WT CRABPII is very similar to the structure of apo-CRABPI except that it does not dimerize. The nuclear localization signal in CRABPII·RA Although CRABPII is a cytosolic protein, upon binding to RA it translocates into the nucleus to transfer RA to the nuclear receptor RAR.36 However, CRABPII does not have a recognizable NLS in its primary structure, leaving open the question of how CRABPII is recognized by adaptor proteins ( importins) and why holo-CRABPII is far more efficiently localized in the nucleus relative to apoCRABPII. Sessler et al. 40 observed structural differences between Mol A of apo-R111M and holo-CRABPII and calculated electrostatic surface potentials of these two proteins.40 This showed that CRABPII·RA has a positively charged patch on the two  helices that is not present in apoR111M (see Figure 3(b) of Sessler et al.40). Three basic residues, Lys20 (on the second helical turn of the 1), Arg29 and Lys30 (both on the second helical turn of 2) make up this positive patch (Figure 7). These residues assume different conformations in holo-CRABPII versus apo-R111M that

Crystal Structure of Human Apo-wild-type CRABPII

lead to a positive electrostatic surface potential on holo-CRABPII and a neutral surface potential on apo-R111M. Comparison of the two structures by Sessler et al.40 showed that upon RA binding these three residues assume an NLS-like structure, similar to what is observed in a classical NLS, SV40-T antigen. They showed that three SV40 peptide residues (Lys128, Lys129 and Lys131) could be approximately superimposed on the three basic residues in CRABPII·RA (Figure 3(g) of Sessler et al.40), though the superposition was far from perfect. However, comparing the conformations of these residues in apo-WT with CRABPII·RA (our data) shows that Lys20, Arg29 and Lys30 have very similar conformations in apo- and holo-CRABPII (Figure 7(a)). As shown in Figure 7(b), Arg29 and Lys20 have very similar conformations in both CRABPII·RA structures (our data versus 1CBS). Though the side-chain of Lys30 has a different orientation between our structure and 1CBS, it is solvent-exposed in both, and has a higher than average B factor in both structures, indicating significant side-chain flexibility. Considering the fact that these residues are long and located at the surface of the molecules, side-chain conformational differences and high B-factors in the different structures are not unexpected. Interestingly Lys20, Arg29 and Lys30 are well defined and have exactly the same conformation in Xtal1, Xtal2 and Xtal3. In short, the differences observed in the conformation of these three basic residues by Sessler et al.40 were due to structural differences that are induced by the R111M mutation. As shown in Figure 7(a), movement of the 2 helix in Mol A of the R111M structure causes dramatic conformational change in both Arg29 and Lys30. Consistent with these observations, partial nuclear localization of apo-CRABPII is evident in the experiments performed by Sessler et al.40 It is clear that RA binding rigidifies the molecule, particularly in this

Figure 7. Significant structural change upon RA binding is not evident for the three residues identified as important for nuclear translocation.

galactopyranoside (IPTG). The growth was continued for another 4 to 5 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 30 min) and frozen at -80 °C. The frozen cells obtained from a 2 l growth were thawed on ice and resuspended in 100 ml of 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0). The suspended cells were lysed by five 45 s bursts of sonication (probe sonicator, Biologics Inc., 60% power) on ice and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C at 5000 rpm. The supernatant was subjected to FastQ (Q-sepharose Fast Flow Resin) column chromatography (80 ml of bed volume; Amersham Biosciences), which was pre-equilibrated with 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0) buffer. The column was washed using the same buffer and proteins were eluted using NaCl gradient of 0 to 200 mM. CRABPII was eluted in 100 mM­150 mM NaCl. The fractions were analyzed by SDS­20% (w/v)polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and those of the highest purity (95%) were pooled together and desalted using a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience) with a 5000 Mr cutoff (10,000 Mr cutoff concentrators showed some protein leakage through the membrane). The desalted protein solution was further purified on a BioRad system (BioLogics Duo Flow, BioRad) using a Source15Q column (Amersham Biosciences) anion exchange column. Fractions were located by measuring the A280 of the fractions and analyzed by SDS­20% PAGE. All the steps of purification were performed at 4 °C. The most pure fractions (95%) were pooled together, concentrated and buffer exchanged (100 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0)) in Vivaspin (Vivascience) concentrators to a concentration of 16-20 mg ml-1, determined by measuring the A280. The pure, concentrated protein solution was aliquoted into 100 l fractions and stored at -80 °C. Preparation of the CRABPII·RA complex

Conclusion
We have determined the first high-resolution structure of apo-CRABPII. Using three different data sets collected on apo-WT CRABPII we have shown that apo- and holo-CRABPII have very similar structures and that the apo-structure is capable of increased flexibility in several regions. Comparison of our apo-WT with the apo-R111M structure shows that mutation of Arg111, one of the conserved residues of CRABPII and a key residue in binding RA to the protein, causes major structural changes in the molecule that had previously been attributed to ligand binding. Our structures demonstrate that ligand binding leads to much less pronounced structural changes than previously thought, but does lead to overall increased rigidity of the structure. This decrease in flexibility may be an important determinant in the increased nuclear localization efficiency of the RAbound protein. In addition our structures have demonstrated structural changes induced by crystal packing in the molecule and have also shown that two apparently identical crystals can harbor demonstrative structural differences in the asymmetric unit.

Materials and Methods
Protein preparation F15W-CRABPII For the preparation of F15W-CRABPII site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the CRABPII-pET17b plasmid following Stratagene's Quikchange® protocol. The primers used for the mutation were: forward: 5CGATCGGAAAACTGGGAGGAATTGCTC-3, reverse: 3-GAGCAATTCCTCCCAGTTTTCCGATCG-5. The PCR products were transfected into JM109 competent Escherichia coli cells for plasmid maintenance.52 General procedure for expression and purification of CRABPII clones Human recombinant CRABPII was expressed and purified as described.47 The target gene (CRABPII/pET17b), as isolated from JM109 using Qiagen's Maxi Prep® DNA isolation kit, was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3)pLysS cells (Stratagene), according to standard protocols. The transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in an LB agar plate containing both ampicillin (100 g ml-1) and chloramphenicol (25 g ml-1). A single colony was inoculated in 100 ml of LB containing the same amount of the two antibiotics and grown overnight with shaking at 250 rpm at 37 °C. This culture was then transferred to 1 l of LB with the same antibiotics. The culture was incubated at 37 °C until A600 reached between 0.6 to 0.8. The expression was induced by addition of 0.4 mM isopropyl-1-thio--D-

All-trans-RA was purchased from Sigma. The complex of CRABPII with all-trans-RA was prepared fresh, before each crystallization experiment. The preparation was performed essentially as described.59 Since RA is light sensitive, all the manipulations of holo-CRABPII were performed in the dark or under red light. We found that crystals of apo-WT cannot tolerate more than 10% ethanol. Therefore, a saturated RA solution in ethanol was made to keep the percentage of ethanol below 10%, while adding  ten equivalents of the ligand. The protein solution was diluted almost ten times with 100 mM Tris­ HCl (pH 8.0) buffer to a concentration of 1.5 mg ml-1. Ten equivalents of RA were added and the solution was reconcentrated to 15 mg ml-1, using Vivaspin concentrators. The CRABPII·RA complex was stored in lightproof tubes at 4 °C for crystallization later. Crystallization and data collection Apo-WT CRABPII Apo-WT CRABPII crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at room temperature (25 °C). Two l of the purified protein solution (at a concentration of 16­20 mg ml-1 in 100 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0) was mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution. The best crystals appeared using reservoir solutions containing either one of the following solutions: (1) 0.2 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0) (or pH 8.5), 30% (w/v) PEG 4000 (or 8000), which is identical to reagent 22 of crystal screen 1 (Hampton Research); or (2) 0.1 M bis- Tris­ propane (pH 6.5), 30% PEG 4000. Crystals appeared in three days and reached their maximum dimensions (0.03 mm × 0.05 mm ×

698
0.05 mm) in a week. Crystals were stabilized by quick soaking in a cryo-protectant solution consisting of the reservoir solution and 30% (v/v) glycerol as the cryoprotectant. Crystals were mounted in nylon loops (Hampton Research) and flash-frozen using liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the BioCars beamline (section 14-ID-B) of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) synchrotron facility (Argonne, IL) using a MAR-CCD (165 mm) detector, a wavelength of 1.0000 Å and under a stream of nitrogen gas at -160 °C. The crystal-to-detector distance was 100 mm and 200 1° oscillation images were collected. Crystals obtained from 0.2 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 30% PEG 8000 were the best diffracting crystals (1.35 Å) although the other crystals also diffracted to high resolutions of 1.5­1.6 Å. Our initial attempts at crystallizing apo-WT CRABPII used protein with an N-terminal His6-tag and resulted only in poorly diffracting crystals. Thus, removal of the His-tag was critical to produce well-diffracting crystals in this case. F15W-CRABPII The F15W CRABPII was crystallized as described for apo-WT CRABPII. Crystals were grown at 0.2 M bis- Tris­ propane (pH 6.5) and 30% PEG 4000, which is identical to one of the apo-CRABPII crystallization conditions. Crystals appeared after three days and reached their maximum

Crystal Structure of Human Apo-wild-type CRABPII size (0.1 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm) after about seven days. Data were collected at the SBC beamline at the APS synchrotron facility. A total of 239 1° oscillation images were collected at a wavelength of 0.99298 Å. CRABPII·RA Crystallization was performed following the apoCRABPII crystallization procedure; however, since RA is light sensitive all manipulations of CRABPII·RA were performed in the dark or under red light. Crystallization boxes were covered with aluminum foil to avoid exposure to light. The best crystals were obtained using a reservoir solution containing 30% PEG 4000, 0.1 M sodium citrate/ citric acid (pH 5.4), and 0.2 ammonium acetate, which is similar to that described.44 Tetragonal shape crystals were obtained in less than a week and reached their maximum size in two weeks. Crystals were cryo-protected in the dark in a solution identical to the reservoir solution plus 30% glycerol. Diffraction data were collected at the COMCAT beamline (32-ID) of APS synchrotron facility in room light, as frozen crystals are stable to light for long periods of time. Two data sets were collected, one with minimal exposure to avoid intensity overload of the low resolution reflections, and one with longer exposure times to better measure the weaker high resolution reflections. Data sets were integrated using DENZO and scaled and merged

Structure solution and refinement All the structure determination and refinement calculations were performed using the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994).51 Apo-WT The structures of both Xtal1 and Xtal2 were determined using rigid body refinement in the CCP4 suite.51 The coordinates of the apo-R111M structure (both of the molecules) were used as the original model. To generate an unbiased Fo-Fc map for the loop connecting the 2 to the B in Mol B, residues 35­41 were deleted in Mol B of R111M. The Fo-Fc maps were calculated based on this unbiased model, which clearly showed that the loop connecting the 2 to the B in Mol B is significantly different in the two structures of Xtal1 and Xtal2. In order to generate an unambiguous Fo-Fc electron density map of the deleted region, residues 35 to 41 of Mol B were built in each structure only after most of the water molecules and residues were built into the electron density and refined. To confirm that we see two different conformations of the loop region in Mol B's of Xtal1 and Xtal2, the occupancies of residues in the loop region and neighboring residues before and after the loop (residues 35 to 41) were set to zero, 15 cycles of REFMAC refinement were run and an Fo-Fc electron density map was calculated using the CCP4 suite.51 This is equivalent to deleting this region and is a REFMAC approach to calculating an omit map. The resulting Fo-Fc omit map for Xtal1 and Xtal2 clearly confirmed that region 36 to 40 in Mol B has two distinct conformations in these two crystals (Figure 8). Further, the two conformations of the loop were verified by calculating the simulated annealing-omit (sa-omit) map of this region using the CNS program.61 The sa-omit map confirmed the two conformations for this loop. Interestingly both omit maps show some additional electron density for the other conformation of the loop in each structure, but the maps were not definitive enough to build an alternative conformation of the loop in each structure. The model was visualized and manually rebuilt with the program TURBO-FRODO.62 Version 5.2.0005 of REFMAC, the maximum-likelihood refinement program, was used to refine the structure against 90% of the data,63 while 10% of data were chosen randomly for crossvalidation, Rfree.64 Ramachandran analysis of the structures calculated by program PROCHECK,65 showed that in Xtal1 and Xtal2 94.3% and 93.5% of the residues are in the most favored region, respectively. In both structures the only residue in the disallowed region was Asp126 A, and the only residue in the generously allowed region was Asp126 B. These residues are located at the sharp turn of the I­J hairpin loop and have higher than average B-factors and poor 2FoFc electron density maps. These two residues are reported to be in the same Ramachandran region in the CRABPII R111M structure and other retinoid-binding proteins. F15W-CRABPII The structure was determined as described for apo-WT CRABPII. Coordinates of both molecules of apo-WT CRABPII were used as the starting model.

The coordinates of each structure have been deposited in the PDB at Brookhaven with entry codes listed in Table 2.
