Abstract An alkaline serine protease, M-protease, from Bacillus sp. KSM-K16 has been crystallized. Two morphologically different crystal forms were obtained. Crystal data of form 1: space group P212121, a = 47.3, b = 62.5, c = 75.6/~, V = 2.23 × 105/~3, Z = 4 and Vm = 2.09/~ 3 Da -I. Crystal data of form 2: space group P212121, a = 75.82(2), b = 57.79(2), c = 54.19(1)A, v = 2.29(2)× 10"sA 3, Z = 4 and Vm = 2.15A3 Da -1. The crystal structure of M-protease in form 2 has been solved by molecular replacement using the atomic model of subtilisin Carlsberg (SBC) which is 60% homologous with M-protease, and refined to the crystallographic R factor of 0.189 for 7004 reflections with Fo/cr(F) > 3 between 7 and 2.4A resolution. The final model of M-protease contains 1882 protein atoms, two calcium ions and 44 water molecules. The three-dimensional structure of M-protease is essentially similar to other subtilisins of known structure. The 269 C ~ positions of M-protease have an r.m.s, difference of 1.06,~ with the corresponding positions of SBC. The crystal data of form 2 are close to those of SBC, though the structure determination of form 2 made it clear that it is not isomorphous to the crystal structure of SBC. The deletions of amino acids occur at the residues 36' and 160'-163' compared with SBC (numerals with primes show the numbering for SBC). The deletion of the four residues (160'-163') may significantly affect the lack of isomorphism between M-protease and SBC. Introduction

Bacillus strains produce extraceilular serine proteases
(Tsuru & Yoshimoto, 1987). Several strains of alkalophilic Bacillus produce alkaline serine proteases which show their optimal activity with alkaline pH (Horikoshi & Akiba, 1982). These alkaline serine proteases are classified as belonging to the subtilisin family. Many X-ray structural studies on the subtilisin family have been carried out in order to understand

the structure-function relationship of subtilisin on the basis of the three-dimensional structure; for example, subtilisin BPN' (Wright, Alden & Kraut, 1969; Alden, Birktoft, Kraut, Robertus & Wright, 1971), subtilisin Novo (Drenth, Hol, Jansonius & Koeboek, 1972), subtilisin Carlsberg (SBC) (Neidhart & Petsko, 1988), the complex of subtilisin BPN' with Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (Hirano, Akagawa, Mitsui & litaka, 1984), the complex of subtilisin Novo with chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (McPhalen, Svendsen, Jonassen & James, 1985), the complex of subtilisin Carlsberg with eglin (McPhalen, Schnebli & James, 1985) or with eglin c (Bode, Papamokos & Musii, 1987), the complex of subtilisin Novo with eglin (Heinz, Priestle, Rahuel, Wilson & Griitter, 1991) and many modified or mutant enzymes such as peroxide-inactivated subtilisin BPN' (Bott et al., 1988). Recently the three-dimensional structure of an alkaline serine protease, PB92, from Bacillus alcalophilus has also been determined (van der Laan et al., 1992), though the coordinates do not appear to have been published yet. A new alkaline serine protease, M-protease, has been purified from Bacillus sp. KSM-K16 and some properties of M-protease have been studied (Kobayashi et al., 1994). The amino-acid sequence of M-protease has already been determined by the analysis of its nucleotide sequence (Hakamada, Kobayashi, Hitomi, Kawai & Ito, 1994). It consists of 269 amino-acid residues and has a molecular weight of 26 723. Comparison of the aminoacid sequence of M-protease with subtilisin Carlsberg shows that the sequence identity between them is 60%. M-protease differs from PB92 only at four residues. The amino-acid sequence of M-protease is compared with that of SBC and PB92 in Fig. 1. M-protease is stable in the pH range between 5 and 12, and it optimal pH range is between 11 and 12.3. This shows that the activity and the stability of M-protease at the high-alkaline pH range are suitable for the additive use in detergent. In order to make clear the three-dimensional structure of M-protease and to obtain the information to design a

M-PROTEASE at pH 5.5 containing 1.4M ammonium sulfate). This droplet was equilibrated against a 1 ml reservoir solution at 291 K. Two morphologically different crystal forms, 1 and 2, were obtained 2 to 3 months later. Generally needle-shaped crystals of form 1 with maximum dimensions of 0.6 x 0.2 x 0 . 2 m m were obtained. The crystals diffract X-rays beyond 2.3/~ resolution using a normal X-ray source. They belong to space group P212121 with a = 47.3, b = 62.5, c = 75.6/~,, V = 2.23 × 105/~3, Z = 4, Vm = 2.09/~3 Da-l, which seem to be isomorphous to the crystals of PB92, however (van der Laan et al., 1992). Occasionally in a droplet one or two pillar crystals of form 2 with maximum dimensions of 1.0 x 0.2 × 0.1 mm were grown. The diffraction power of crystal form 2 is rather weak and the resolution limit is almost 2.8 A using a Rigaku RU300 X-ray generator (focus size 0.3 x 3 mm, 50 kV, 100mA). The crystal data of form 2, space group P212121, a = 75.82(2), b = 57.79(2), c = 54.19 (1) /~, V = 2.29 (2) × 105 t~3, Z = 4 and Vm = 2.15/~3 Da-I are, on the whole, close to those of SBC (Neidhart & Petsko, 1988), i.e. P212121, a = 76.67, b = 55.65, c = 53.08 A, V = 2.26 × 105A 3, Z = 4, though the structure analysis of form 2 made it clear that the crystal structures of form 2 and SBC are not isomorphous to each other.

series of more useful enzymes, we have thus initiated the structural study of M-protease. Upon crystallization two morphologically different crystal forms of M-protease, 1 and 2, were obtained, of which form 1 seems to be isomorphous to the crystal structure of PB92. Therefore, the structure analysis of form 2 have at first been carried out. Here the X-ray structure determination of form 2 and comparison of the structure of M-protease with that of SBC are presented.

Experimental
Crystallization
M-protease was purified in the inactivated form by treatment with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and freeze dried. The crystallization was carried out by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. The freezedried enzyme was dissolved in an 50 mM acetate buffer solution (pH 5.5) to a concentration of 10 mg ml -~. A 5 l.tl droplet of the protein solution was mixed in an equal amount of a reservoir solution (50 mM acetate buffer

The molecular-replacement search model adopted was the 2.5/~ crystal structure of SBC (PDB entry number 1SBC). All the atoms of SBC except for a Ca 2+ ion and water molecules were used as the search model. The search model was placed in a P1 orthogonal cell with a = b = c = 120A, and the structure factors were calculated using the program FFTSF (Ten Eyck,

Results and discussion

The Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) in Fig. 2 indicates that an upper limit for the estimated errors in the atomic coordinates were 0.25 ,~ for the refined structure.

Structural comparison with subtilisin Carlsberg (SBC)
1973). Cross-rotation functions were calculated using the fast-rotation function (Crowther, 1972), in which the resolution ranges and the outer Patterson radii for the sphere of integration were varied; the optimum results were obtained with the data between 8 and 3.5/~, resolution and the radius of 20.4/~. The crossrotation searches were carried out in 5 ° steps in all three spherical polar angles (~,, cp, X). The highest peak located at ~, = 35, qo = 170, X, = 220°, which clearly showed that the crystal structure of M-protease was not isomorphous to that of SBC. The rotational parameters were refined using PROTEIN (Steigemann, 1974). Translation functions were calculated using the T function (Crowther & Blow, 1967), as implemented in the program ELTFCALC (Lattman, 1985). The highest peak in each Harker section calculated using 6-4 A data gave a unique consistent solution. The molecularreplacement model (1920 non-H atoms included but Ca 2+ ions excluded) gave an initial R factor of 0.472 for 1671 reflections between 7 and 4/~ resolution. The three-dimensional structure of M-protease is essentially similar to other subtilisins of known structure where eight helices form a basic skeleton. The overall folding of M-protease is shown in Fig. 3, superimposed on that of SBC (Neidhart & Petsko, 1988). The prominent structural differences between M-protease and SBC were observed around the deletion regions. Superposition of SBC on to M-protease using all the 269 C ~ positions gave an overall r.m.s, difference of 1.06 A, where five residues in SBC, 36' and 160'-163', were

Refinement
The molecular-replacement model was refined using a combination of simulated-annealing refinement with the X-PLOR system (Brtinger, 1990) and computergraphics model building with the Turbo-FRODO software (Cambillau, 1992). The rigid-body refinement gave an R factor of 0.456 and after the first cycle of the slowcool protocol the R factor dropped to 0.262, at 7-4/~ resolution. Then the resolution range was extended to 2.4/~ resolution [7004 reflections with a 3or(F) cutoff] and individual temperature factors for the non-H atoms were applied. The second cycle of the simulatedannealing refinement gave an R factor of 0.251. At this stage most amino-acid residues different to those in M-protease were changed and the side chains were fitted into a 2Fo- Fc map. The third of the seven cycles of refinement reduced the R factor to 0.209. In total, 1882 non-H protein atoms, two Ca ions and 44 water molecules were added after the following eight cycles of the X-PLOR refinement, lowering the R factor to 0.175. Final positional refinement was carried out with PROLSQ (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980). After five cycles of refinement the r.m.s, deviations from ideal

M-PROTEASE in the same orientation between M-protease and SBC. The side-chain dihedral angle X1 is 76.5 ° for Trp6 and 86.7 ° for Tyr6'. The movement of this part, therefore, may be attributable to the larger size of Trp compared with Tyr. The other large difference of 2.01 A between M-protease and SBC occurs at residue 252. The shift in the surface loop (residues 247-253) connecting the H7 helix with the H8 helix may be induced by a packing effect rather than by the deletion of an aromatic side chain due to the substitution of Tyr255' (SBC) to Gly250 (M-protease). The other high deviations occur at the region from Pro129 to Argl43 a large part of which is contained in the H5 helix. This shows that the overlap of the exposed H5 helices on each molecular surface is poor. The shift of H5 may be due to the aminoacid substitution from Gly (130' in SBC) to Pro (129 in M-protease). The average temperature (B) factor of main-chain atoms is 8.6/~2, of side-chain atoms 9.1/~2 and of all protein atoms 8.8/~2. The variation of the B factors for both the main-chain and the side-chain atoms as a function of residue number is shown in Fig. 5. The several surface-loop regions exhibit higher B factors. The average B value for residues 53-57, 21.1/~2, is highest in M-protease as shown in Fig. 5. This shows the great flexibility of the surface loop region (residues 52-58) where the insertion at 55' and the deletion at 57 occur among M-protease, PB92 and SBC. The same flexibility is observed for the corresponding surface loops of SBC and PB92. The average B value for the region 124--128

omitted because of the deletion in M-protease (Fig. 1). The largest differences in C a positions are near the deletion region, that is, 157' (difference 2.48/~), 158' (4.80/~) and 159' (8.40A). The overall r.m.s. value dropped to 0.87/~, when these three residues were excluded and to 0.82,~ when two more residues 37'-38' (differences 3.48 and 2.48/~, respectively) were also excluded. Results of the superposition between Mprotease and SBC are shown in Fig. 4, as a function of residue number. Table 2 shows the results from the superposition of individual helices. A common Ca 2+ ion between M-protease and SBC, Ca276, shows a positional difference of 0.38/~. There are three fragments of the main chain where the C a atoms deviate by more than 2/~ from each other. Those of the C-terminal region (residues 262-269) have an average difference of 1.45/~ (the highest difference is 2.59/~ at Arg269) between M-protease and SBC. A large difference between PB92 and SBC is also observed at the C-terminal region (van der Laan et al., 1992). Other large differences are observed on the surface loops. Larger differences occur at Asp175 (2.04/~,) and Gln176 (2.40/~) in the surface loop (residues 175-189). The main chain for residues 175-176 is in contact with the side chain of Trp6. The corresponding contacts in SBC are those between residues 180'-181' and Tyr6'. The indole moiety of Trp6 and the phenol moiety of Tyr6' are

TAKASHI YAMANE et al. is highest in PB92, though that for the corresponding regions in M-protease and SBC is not so high. The average B value for residues 153'-155' is second highest in SBC. On the other hand that for the corresponding regions in M-protease and PB92 is moderate. These results show that the flexibility of surface loops among M-protease, SBC and PB92 differs. The B factors of two Ca 2÷ ions are 10.2 and 26.6 ~2, respectively. In the final refinement a total of 44 solvent water molecules were contained in the model. The B factors of the water molecules range from 2.0 to 48.3 A 2 with an average of 16.1/~2. The rather small number of the water molecules found in the crystal structure may be partly attributed to the resolution limit of 2.4/~ and partly to the criteria for acceptance being the formation of at least two hydrogen bonds and the B value less than 50.0/~2. A Ramachandran (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) plot is shown in Fig. 6. Most of the (qa, ~b) angles are within the acceptable regions, except for Ser55, Asn178 and Ala266. The dihedral angles (qa, ~b) of these residues are (-99.0,-104.4°), (100.0, 21.2 °) and (84.5,--61.1°), respectively. All the three residues are located on flexible regions. Ser55 is contained in the most flexible loop region, and the average B value of the side chain of Ser55 is highest in M-protease (Fig. 5). Asn178 and Ala266 are also contained in a surface loop (residues 175-189) and the C-terminal region, respectively, where large differences of the C a positions between M-protease and SBC were observed (Fig. 4). There remain some ambiguities in these residues because the corresponding electron densities are fairly broad. A break of the H1 helix occurs at residue 12

203

and helix H2 begins at residue 13. The (qa, ~b) angles of Glnl2 and Lysl2'(SBC) are (52.7, 39.9 °) and (55.6, 38.8°), respectively. The substitution of Pro for Asp at residue 14 does not cause a break in this helix. The (q0, ~b) pair of Prol4 is (-50.8, -39.6°). M-protease differs in sequence by four residues from PB92. Va1224 is substituted by an alanyl residue in both PB92 and SBC. The side chain of Va1224 is in contact with that of Ala264. Side-chain exchanges of a compensatory nature, Va1224 and Ala264 in M-protease in place of Ala229' and Va!269' in SBC, are observed. It is interesting that such compensatory changes do not occur in PB92 because Ala264 is conserved in PB92. Asn253 is substituted by a seryl residue also in both PB92 and SBC. M-proteas, forms intramolecular hydrogen bonds from Asn253 0 °1 to Asn255 N and to Leu256 N, as shown in Fig. 7(a), though Ser258' does not form any intramolecular hydrogen bonds in SBC (Fig. 7b). The side chain of Ser85 in M-protease and possibly that of Asn85 in PB92 have no intramolecular contacts. On the other hand, the side chain of Ser86' forms a weak hydrogen bond to that of Lys22' in SBC. Residue 250 is completely different among these subtilisins, that is, Gly in M-protease, Ser in PB92 and Tyr in SBC. The side chain of Tyr255' in SBC is located on the molecular surface and has no intramolecular

The peptide bond between Tyrl61 and Pro162 takes a cis conformation (02 = 6.5°). The cis peptide bond is also found in the same position in SBC and PB92.

Crystal packing
The crystal data of form 2 are close to those of SBC, though the structure determination of form 2 using the molecular-replacement method made it clear that crystals of M-protease are not isomorphous with those of SBC. Fig. 8 shows the packing scheme of M-protease and that of SBC in each crystallographic unit cell. One of the differences of the intermolecular contacts between M-protease and SBC is shown in Fig. 9. The residues 158'-161' which form a ~3-turn in SBC protrude on its molecular surface. By the deletion of the residues 160'-163', a short-cut in the main chain occurs in Mprotease; that is, Ser158 moves to I1e159, occupying the nearby position of residue 163' in SBC. The difference of the C a positions between Gly157 and Ser158' is 0.63 ,~, and that between Ile159 and I1e164' is 0.80/~,. Both values lie below the overall r.m.s, difference. The surface loop of residues 247-253 of the neighboring molecule related by crystallographic symmetry occupies the space which is made available by the deletion of the 3-turn. As a result of the deletion in M-protease, two intermolecular hydrogen bonds are formed (Fig. 9a). If the 3-turn is conserved in M-protease, Asn246 and Thr247 of the neighboring molecule almost coincide with residues 158' and 159', respectively. This leads to breakage of the packing scheme of M-protease. Therefore, we conclude that the deletion of the four residues (160'-163') is responsible for the stable packing of M-protease, resulting in the lack of isomorphism with SBC. C O (a)

Structures of the catalytic triad
The catalytic triad of M-protease is composed of Asp32, His62 and Ser215. The electron density for the catalytic triad in the final 2Fo -F¢ map is shown in Fig. 10(a), and the structure of the catalytic triad is compared with that of SBC in Fig. 10(b). There is a significant peak (2.3o" level on a 2Fo - F c map and 6o" level on an F o - F ¢ map) adjacent to His62C ~2. The distance between the peak center and His62 C s2 was 2.40,~. The peak is highest in an Fo- Fc map, and may be retainable as a water molecule. However it was not assigned to a water molecule because it did not fit the aforementioned criteria. The arrangement of the side chains in the catalytic triad is well conserved between M-protease and SBC, except for the disposition of Ser215 O "r. The torsion angles XI of Ser215 are 18.3 ° for M-protease and -135.7 ° for SBC. The difference of the O "r posi-

Dashed lines show the intermolecular hydrogen bonds. (b) The corresponding portion of SBC is superposed with medium lines. By the deletion of the residues 160~-163t, it is made possible for residues 246-247 of the neighboring molecule to be in contact with Gly157 as shown above.

are given in Table 3. Table 3 shows that one or two hydrogen bonds are formed between His62N ~l and the carboxyl group of Asp32. The rather long distance of 3.37 A between Ser215 O "~ and His62 N e2 and the angles of Ser215C~--O "~...His62N e2 (82.2 °) in M-protease suggest that no hydrogen bond is formed between Ser215 O "~ and His62 N e2. On the other hand one is formed in both SBC (Neidhart & Petsko, 1988) and PB92 (van der Laan et al., 1992). The different orientation of Ser215 O "~ may be induced by the modification with PMSF. An Fo- Fc map calculated using the final model showed some perturbation around Ser215 O "~ (Fig. 10b). There remained a positive peak about 2 A from the O "~ position. This was then treated as an SO2 moiety in PMSF and included in the refinement, and the R value went up to 0.202. The refined B values for the tentative SO2 group were 42.2A 2 for S, 41.2A 2 for O 1 and 41.7 A 2 for O2. In addition appropriate electron density for phenylmethyl moiety in PMSF did not appear in an F o - F c map. Therefore, the SO2 moiety was removed from the model. To construct the PMSF group and check the effect on the orientation of the catalytic triad, the structure refined

at higher resolution will be required. Unfortunately, the quality of form 2 is not suitable for high-resolution analysis. We could, however, collect the X-ray data of form 1 at 1.6 A resolution, and structure analysis is in progress in order to make a detailed comparison of the side-chain orientation of Ser215 in the catalytic triad of M-protease, SBC and PB92, and to clarify the pH stability of M-protease.
