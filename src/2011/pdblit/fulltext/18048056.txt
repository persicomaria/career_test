SUMMARY

Adhesive type 1 pili from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains are heat and denaturant resistant, filamentous protein complexes. Individual pilus subunits associate through ``donor strand complementation,'' whereby the incomplete immunoglobulin-like fold of each subunit is completed by the N-terminal extension of a neighboring subunit. We show that antiparallel donor strand insertion generally causes nonequilibrium behavior in protein folding and extreme activation energy barriers for dissociation of subunit-subunit complexes. We identify the most kinetically stable, noncovalent protein complex known to date. The complex between the pilus subunit FimG and the donor strand peptide of the subunit FimF shows an extrapolated dissociation half-life of 3 3 109 years. The 15 residue peptide forms ideal intermolecular b sheet H-bonds with FimG over 10 residues, and its hydrophobic side chains strongly interact with the hydrophobic core of FimG. The results show that kinetic stability and nonequilibrium behavior in protein folding confers infinite stability against dissociation in extracellular protein complexes.
INTRODUCTION Many Gram-negative pathogens adhere to the host tissue via filamentous, adhesive pili or fimbria that are assembled via the ``chaperone-usher'' pathway (Hung and Hultgren, 1998; Thanassi et al., 1998; Vetsch and Glockshuber, 2005). Among the best characterized pilus systems are type 1 pili from uropathogenic E. coli strains. They are composed of up to 3000 subunits of the main structural subunit FimA, which forms the pilus rod (Figure 1A; Hahn et al., 2002; Jones et al., 1995). A single copy of the adhesin FimH, which recognizes mannose units on target proteins of the urinary tract epithelium (Eto et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2001), is connected to the rod by one or several copies of the minor subunits FimG and FimF, which, together with FimH, form the linear tip fibrillum (Figure 1A). The structural type 1 pilus subunits are homologous, one domain proteins that share an immunoglobulin-like fold lacking the C-terminal

b strand (Choudhury et al., 1999). The subunits FimA, FimF, and FimG each possess an N-terminal extension of 15­20 residues that serves as a donor strand and completes the fold of the preceding subunit. This assembly mechanism, reminiscent of ``domain swapping'' (Bennett et al., 1994), is termed donor strand complementation (DSC) (Choudhury et al., 1999; Sauer et al., 1999). FimH lacks an N-terminal donor strand and, instead, possesses an N-terminal lectin domain that is fused to the FimH pilin domain and is responsible for receptor binding (Choudhury et al., 1999; Hahn et al., 2002). Type 1 pilus assembly in vivo requires the soluble periplasmic chaperone FimC and the assembly platform (``usher'') FimD in the outer bacterial membrane (Jones et al., 1993; Klemm and Christiansen, 1990; Saulino et al., 1998, 2000). FimC catalyzes the folding of the pilus subunits in the periplasm and forms stoichiometric 1:1 complexes with the subunits (Jones et al., 1993; Vetsch et al., 2004). The X-ray structures of the FimC%FimH complex (Choudhury et al., 1999), related chaperone-subunit complexes (Sauer et al., 1999; Verger et al., 2007; Zavialov et al., 2003), and complexes between pilus subunits and synthetic donor strand peptides (Sauer et al., 2002; Zavialov et al., 2003) showed that the chaperone donates an extended polypeptide segment to the bound subunits in an orientation parallel to the C-terminal ``F-strand'' of the subunits, while the donor strands from subunits are inserted antiparallel to the F-strand in both the quaternary structure of the pilus and the peptide-subunit complexes. Pilus assembly in vivo is thus characterized by a donor strand exchange (DSE) reaction in which the donor strand of the chaperone is replaced by reversed insertion of the donor strand of the following subunit (Anderson et al., 2004; Barnhart et al., 2003; Choudhury et al., 1999; Sauer et al., 1999, 2002; Verger et al., 2007; Zavialov et al., 2003, 2005). Type 1 pili are highly stable, supramolecular protein complexes that cannot be dissociated and denatured by boiling in SDS or concentrated denaturant solutions (Eshdat et al., 1981; McMichael and Ou, 1979; Salit and Gotschlich, 1977). In the present study, we address the question of whether the orientation of the donor strand is responsible for the extreme stability of type 1 pili. On the basis of previous experiments showing that C-terminal elongation of pilus subunits led to intramolecular self-complementation and increased the stability of the subunits against aggregation and unfolding (Barnhart et al., 2000; Erilov et al., 2007; Zavialov et al., 2005), we constructed a series of self-complemented variants of the type 1 pilus subunit FimG

Figure 1. Schematic Representation of Type 1 Pilus Assembly via the ChaperoneUsher Pathway and the Different Subunit Constructs Analyzed in This Study
(A) Type 1 pili are composed of up to 3000 FimA subunits, which form the helical pilus rod, and of the subunits FimF, FimG, and the adhesin FimH, which form the tip fibrillum. FimH, in contrast to all other subunits, consists of two domains: an N-terminal lectin domain (FimHL) and a C-terminal pilin domain (FimHP), which is homologous to the other pilus subunits. The chaperone FimC catalyzes folding of the subunits and forms complexes with the subunits via parallel donor strand complementation. FimC delivers the bound subunit to the outer membrane assembly platform FimD (the usher), where the incoming subunit replaces the FimC donor strand in the previously incorporated subunit by antiparallel insertion of its N-terminal donor strand extension. (B) Scheme of self-complemented FimHP constructs with artificial, N-terminal donor strands. The topology model shows that the strands can only insert in a parallel orientation relative to the C-terminal (F) strands. (C) Schematic representation of FimHP and FimGt constructs with artificial, C-terminal donor strand, in which antiparallel donor strand insertion is enforced. Spontaneous, antiparallel donor strand insertion was observed for the bimolecular complex between FimGt and the donor strand peptide of FimF (FimGt%DSF).

and the C-terminal pilin domain of FimH (FimHP, residues 158­ 279; Vetsch et al., 2002). We show that self-complemented subunits with antiparallel donor strands have an increased thermodynamic stability, compared with noncomplemented subunits. More important, however, is the general observation that antiparallel, but not parallel, donor strand orientation leads to high activation energy barriers in folding and unfolding and to nonequilibrium behavior in denaturant-induced unfolding/refolding transitions of self-complemented pilus subunits. Identical observations were made for bimolecular complexes between the pilus subunit FimG and donor strand peptides that spontaneously inserted in the antiparallel orientation and for the entire type 1 pilus rod. We solved the X-ray structure of the bimolecular complex between the subunit FimG and the FimF donor strand peptide, which turned out to be the most kinetically stable protein-ligand complex described so far. Its structural homology with analogous peptide complexes from the P- and Caf-pilus systems suggests that high activation energy barriers for unfolding and dissociation are the general basis for the remarkable stability of extracellular protein complexes such as adhesive pili. RESULTS Antiparallel Donor Strand Orientation Causes Nonequilibrium Behavior in Denaturant-Induced Unfolding/Refolding Transitions To investigate the role of donor strand orientation on pilus subunit stability, we made use of the fact that the lacking b strand is inserted between the first (A-strand) and the last (F-strand)

b strand of the pilin domains (Choudhury et al., 1999; Sauer et al., 1999, 2002; Zavialov et al., 2003). We elongated the C-terminal pilin domain of FimH (FimHP) at the N or C terminus by the donor strand segments of the subunits FimF and FimG and the donor strand segment of the chaperone FimC via linkers of 4­5 amino acid residues (for details, see the Supplemental Data available with this article online). As a result of steric restriction caused by the short linkers, the parallel and antiparallel donor strand orientation in the resulting N- and C-terminal, self-complemented FimHP constructs, respectively, is enforced in an unambiguous manner (Figures 1B and 1C). Analysis of the FimHP structure in the complex with FimC (Choudhury et al., 1999) shows that constructs with alternative donor strand insertion possibilities would require linker lengths of at least 11 residues. In contrast to noncomplemented FimHP, which is aggregation prone (Vetsch et al., 2002), all self-complemented constructs were obtained as soluble proteins upon periplasmic expression. The only exception was the construct with the FimC donor strand fused to the N terminus of FimHP, which formed aggregates during purification. The soluble constructs with the respective donor strands were termed FimHP-DSC and FimHP-DSF for the C-terminal fusions, and DSF-FimHP and DSG-FimHP for the N-terminal fusions (Figures 1B and 1C). To assess the thermodynamic stability of the self-complemented FimHP variants, we measured guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)-dependent unfolding/refolding transitions at pH 7.0 and 25 C. FimHP without donor strand is folding competent but only marginally stable (DG0 = À9.5 kJ molÀ1) (Vetsch et al., f 2002). The self-complemented constructs DSF-FimHP and

DSG-FimHP with parallel donor strand orientation are stabilized by 6.9 and 17.0 kJ molÀ1 relative to FimHP, respectively, and show fully reversible folding equilibria with identical transitions for the unfolding and refolding reaction (Figure 2A; Table 1). In contrast, the construct FimHP-DSF with the donor strand of FimF in the antiparallel orientation shows unfolding curves at high and refolding curves at low denaturant concentrations that are in full agreement with an unattained two-state equilibrium (Figure 2C). The same behavior was first observed for an analogous, self-complemented FimHP construct, FimHP-DSG, with antiparallel FimG donor strand (Erilov et al., 2007). The only exception among the constructs with antiparallel donor strand orientation was that with the donor strand from the chaperone FimC (FimHP-DSC), for which reversible transitions were observed after 2 d at 25 C (Figure 2B). The FimC donor strand segment fused to the C terminus stabilized FimHP by 17.3 kJ molÀ1 (Table 1) but did not prevent unfolding of FimHP under short-term incubation with high denaturant concentrations, as observed for FimHP-DSF and FimHP-DSG (Erilov et al., 2007). This is most likely due to an intrinsic property of the FimC donor strand sequence discussed below. The nonequilibrium transitions of FimHP-DSF and FimHP-DSG (Erilov et al., 2007) indicated that the antiparallel donor strand orientation observed in subunit-subunit contacts in the pilus (Sauer et al., 2002; Verger et al., 2007; Zavialov et al., 2003) is the general mechanism underlying the high activation energy barriers for unfolding and dissociation of subunit-subunit complexes. To test this hypothesis, we constructed an analogous, self-complemented variant of the subunit FimG, FimGt-DSF, with the donor strand of FimF (the neighboring subunit in the pilus; see Figure 1A) attached to the C terminus. Because FimG, in contrast to FimHP, has a natural N-terminal donor strand, we used an N-terminally truncated variant of FimG without donor strand (FimGt) (Vetsch et al., 2004) to prevent self-assembly of FimG and to unequivocally assess the effect of the artificial C-terminal FimF strand. Figure 2D shows that the self-complemented variant FimGt-DSF indeed exhibits the same nonequilibrium folding behavior that was observed for FimHP-DSF (Figure 2C) and FimHP-DSG (Erilov et al., 2007). With increasing incubation time, the unfolding transition moves toward lower and the refolding transition toward higher GdmCl concentrations, but its folding equilibrium is far from being reached even after 50 days of incubation. All nonequilibrium transitions of self-complemented pilin domain constructs were in full agreement with a simple two-state model of folding with unattained equilibria caused by very slow unfolding and refolding rates in the absence of denaturant, and an exponential dependence of the rate constants of unfolding and refolding on denaturant concentration (Erilov et al., 2007). The global kinetic analysis of the unfolding and refolding transitions of FimHP-DSF and FimGt-DSF (solid lines in Figures 2C and 2D), which predicts the fraction of native molecules (fN) as a function of denaturant concentration, incubation time, and the fraction of native molecules in the beginning of the experiment (Erilov et al., 2007; see Equation 1 in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures), revealed a strong thermodynamic stabilization of FimHP and FimGt through antiparallel donor strand complementation (Table 1). The free energies of folding are À52.0 and À79.7 kJ molÀ1 for the constructs FimHP-DSF and

FimGt-DSF, respectively. This compares with the marginal stabilities of the domains without donor strand (À9.5 kJ molÀ1 for FimHP and À10.9 kJ molÀ1 for FimGt; Table 1), and the maximum stability of À26.8 kJ molÀ1 of a self-complemented FimHP construct with parallel donor stand orientation (Table 1). In addition, the unfolding reactions in the absence of denaturant for both FimHP-DSF and FimGt-DSF are extremely slow, with extrapolated half-lives of 6.3 3 103 years for FimHP-DSF and 2.4 3 106 years for FimGt-DSF (Table 1). We also calculated the time required to attain indistinguishable unfolding and refolding transitions at 25 C, which is 3.3 years for FimHP-DSF and 14 years for FimGt-DSF, assuming an experimental error in the spectroscopic signal of 2% at the transition midpoint. Together with the parameters obtained for the previously analyzed construct FimHP-DSG (Erilov et al., 2007; Table 1), the data demonstrate the very high kinetic stability against unfolding of selfcomplemented pilin domains with antiparallel donor strand insertion. High Activation Energy Barriers for Dissociation of Pilin Domain Complexes The nonequilibrium behavior of the unfolding and refolding transitions is obviously caused by high activation energy barriers for folding and unfolding. Thus, a strong dependence of the rates of unfolding and refolding on temperature is expected. Indeed, fully reversible unfolding/refolding transitions were observed for the self-complemented construct FimGt-DSF at temperatures of 60 C and 65 C after two days of incubation (Figure 2E). The deduced respective DG0 values of À30.5 and À24.8 kJ molÀ1 conf firm the high stability of FimGt-DSF. In accordance with reversible unfolding/refolding equilibria at temperatures above 60 C, FimGt-DSF showed reversible thermal unfolding, with a melting temperature of 83 C and a melting enthalpy of 611 kJ molÀ1 (Figure 2F). The Binary FimGt%DSF Complex Dissociates Only Once in Three Billion Years We next prepared a bimolecular complex between FimGt and the synthetic peptide corresponding to the FimF donor strand (FimGt%DSF; Figure 1C) by refolding of FimGt in the presence of excess DSF. This complex is analogous to the most stable, self-complemented construct FimGt-DSF (Table 1), except that donor strand and pilus subunit are not linked covalently. The bimolecular FimGt%DSF complex also showed nonequilibrium behavior in its unfolding/refolding transitions but, surprisingly, proved to be even more stable against unfolding than FimGtDSF (Figure 3A): incubation for one day in 6 M GdmCl did not trigger unfolding, while most molecules of the self-complemented construct FimGt-DSF were already unfolded under the same conditions (Figure 2D). A possible reason for the higher stability of the intermolecular complex might be some residual strain in FimGt-DSF caused by the linker between the natural C terminus of FimG and the donor strand of FimF, even though a flexible linker of 9 glycine residues was used. The nonequilibrium unfolding behavior of the bimolecular complex indicated that the donor strand peptide spontaneously inserted in the more stable, antiparallel orientation (see also below). Although the FimGt%DSF complex is bimolecular, the theory of unattained folding/unfolding equilibria of a monomeric protein (Erilov et al., 2007) well

described the unfolding and refolding transitions of the complex after different incubation times (dashed and solid lines in Figure 3A; see Table 1 for a tentative evaluation). However, because the refolding reaction of the complex is bimolecular and depends on the concentrations of FimGt and the DSF peptide (Figure S3), we restricted the quantitative analysis of the data in Figure 3A to the unimolecular unfolding/dissociation reaction of the complex (Table 1). Figure 3B shows that the logarithm of the unfolding rate constants deduced from the data points in the transition regions of the unfolding reactions of the complex after 20 hr and 50 d of incubation (Figure 3A) indeed depend lin-

early on denaturant concentration, and yield an extrapolated rate constant of 6.6 3 10À18 sÀ1, corresponding to a half-life of unfolding/dissociation of 3.4 billion years at pH 7.0 and 25 C. We obtained independent confirmation that the FimGt%DSF complex indeed dissociates only upon unfolding of FimGt from an experiment where we again incubated the complex at pH 7.0 and 25 C for one day at different GdmCl concentrations. The unfolding/dissociation reaction was first recorded by far-UV CD spectroscopy (Figure 4A, open circles). In parallel, aliquots of the same samples were subjected to analytical gel filtration at the corresponding GdmCl concentrations, which allowed chromatographic separation of the native FimGt%DSF complex, unfolded FimGt, and free donor strand peptide DSF (Figure 4B). Quantitative evaluation of the three species at the different GdmCl concentrations (Figure 4A, filled circles) revealed that the disappearance of the

Constructs Showing Equilibrium Behavior in Folding at pH 7.0 and 25 C. Values for FimHP (Vetsch et al., 2002) and FimGt are only derived from refolding transitions, because the native proteins showed high aggregation tendency upon concentration and storage in the absence of denaturant. The pretransition baselines were fixed to zero as a result of the low stability of FimHP and FimGt. c Constructs with Antiparallel Donor Strand Insertion and Nonequilibrium Folding at pH 7.0 and 25 C. d Data from Erilov et al. (2007). e The nonequilibrium transitions of the bimolecular FimGt%DSF complex (Figure 3A) were tentatively evaluated according to an unattained folding equilibrium of a monomeric protein (Erilov et al., 2007). However, the refolding/association reaction depended on FimGt and peptide concentration (Figure S3). Therefore, only the kinetic parameters of the unimolecular unfolding/dissociation reaction are correct. All other parameters (numbers in square brackets) from the fit to a unimolecular unfolding/refolding reaction are only tentative but nevertheless indicated here, because they underline the enormous stability of the FimGt%DSF complex (refolding reactions were performed with equimolar concentrations (10 mM) of FimGt and DSF).
b

native complex coincided with the unfolding transition recorded by CD spectroscopy. This proves that the donor strand peptide is indeed released from FimGt only when FimGt unfolds. The donor strand peptide in the FimGt%DSF complex thus becomes part of the protein's tertiary structure, and the entire complex behaves as if it were a single polypeptide chain. The results show that the FimGt%DSF complex is, to the best of our knowledge, the most stable, noncovalent complex between a protein and a ligand described to date. Its dissociation at neutral pH and 25 C is about 10 orders of magnitude slower than the dissociation of the avidin/biotin complex (t1/2 = several days), which is often described as the most stable protein ligand complex (Piran and Riordan, 1990). Infinite Kinetic Stability of the Type 1 Pilus Rod against Dissociation and Unfolding The very high activation energy barrier for unfolding of the FimGt%DSF complex prompted us to compare the kinetic stability against unfolding and dissociation of the FimGt%DSF complex, FimGt-DSF, the FimC%FimGt complex, and the entire type 1 pilus rod composed of FimA subunits (Figure 1A). Because the FimGt%DSF complex required GdmCl concentrations above 7 M for unfolding within one day (Figure 3A), the measurements were performed at pH 2.0 instead of pH 7.0. At pH 2.0 and zero denaturant, both FimGt-DSF and the FimGt%DSF complex are still fully native and show indistinguishable CD spectra, compared with those at pH 7.0 (Figure S1A), but are less stable against unfolding by GdmCl. This allowed the determination of obs the rate constants of unfolding (kU ) over a wider range of GdmCl concentrations with CD or fluorescence spectroscopy

(Figures S1A, S1B, and S1D). At pH 2.0, the plot of the logarithms obs of the observed rate constants of unfolding (kU ) on GdmCl concentration for the FimGt constructs complemented with the FimF donor strand shows a significant deviation from linearity at high GdmCl concentrations. The data were fitted according to a three-state model with a metastable intermediate and a switch of the rate-limiting transition state (Bachmann and Kiefhaber, obs 2001) for extrapolation of kU to zero GdmCl (Figure 3C). The extrapolated half-life of unfolding at pH 2.0 and 25 C in the absence of GdmCl is 215 years for the self-complemented FimGt-DSF construct, and about 9000 years for the FimGt%DSF complex (Figure 3C, Table 2). In contrast, the corresponding complex between the chaperone FimC and FimGt unfolds and dissociates already spontaneously at pH 2.0, with a half-life of 0.3 s. For measuring the stability of the entire pilus rod at pH 2.0, we used a preparation of intact type 1 pili, which essentially consist of FimA subunits (Figure 1A); on average, FimH, FimF, and FimG only comprise about 2% of the entire pilus mass (Krogfelt and Klemm, 1988). As observed for the unfolding kinetics of FimGtDSF and the FimGt%DSF complex, unfolding of the entire pilus rod, recorded with far-UV CD, followed a monoexponential decay. The logarithms of the rate constants of dissociation at pH 2.0 between 6 and 7 M GdmCl showed an about 3-fold higher dependence on denaturant concentration, compared with the unfolding reactions of FimGt-DSF and the FimGt%DSF complex (Figure 3C), indicating that multiple intersubunit interactions in the quaternary structure of the pilus have to be broken upon dissociation/unfolding, in addition to the interactions from intermolecular donor strand complementation. Similar to the unfolding kinetics of FimGt-DSF and the FimGt%DSF complex at pH 2.0,

The dashed blue lines represent the tentative evaluation of the refolding transitions of FimGt%DSF. The equilibrium refolding transition of FimGt without donor strand is also shown (>). (B) Linear dependence of the logarithm of the unobs folding rates kU of FimGt%DSF on GdmCl concentration at pH 7.0 and 25 C. Rate constants were derived from data points in the transition regions of the unfolding reactions of panel A after 20 hr () and 50 d (-) of incubation.

The logarithm of the observed rate constants was plotted against GdmCl concentration and extrapolated to zero GdmCl. Except for the linear relationship observed for unfolding of the FimC%FimGt complex (kinetic m-value: mNU = 1.2 MÀ1), all other unfolding reactions were fitted to a three-state model with metastable on-pathway folding intermediate and a change in the rate-limiting transition state at high GdmCl concentrations (see the Supplemental Data). Kinetic m-values for FimGt-DSF and FimGt%DSF were calculated as follows: mNI = 1.4 MÀ1, mIN = À0.93 MÀ1, and mIU = 1.1 MÀ1; for pili, mNI = 2.0 MÀ1, mIN = À0.35 MÀ1, and mIU = 7.5 MÀ1.

The kinetic m-value for FimGt%DSFI5A,I7A,V11A was mNU = 0.68 MÀ1. The m-values for all other constructs are the same as those for FimGt%DSF in panel C.

a deviation from linearity toward lower unfolding rates is observed for the rod at GdmCl concentrations above 7 M. Three-state evaluation revealed that the extrapolated half-life of dissociation of the pilus rod at pH 2.0 in the absence of denaturant is 4.8 3 1021 years--that is, 1011-fold longer than the age of the universe. This is of course only a hypothetical value, which nevertheless impressively demonstrates the kinetic stability of the rod against unfolding and dissociation. We next confirmed that dissociation of intact pilus rods also requires unfolding of FimA subunits. Type 1 pili were incubated for 20 hr at different GdmCl concentrations at pH 7.0 and 60 C (at neutral pH and saturated GdmCl solutions, type 1 pili can be dissociated only at 37 C; Eshdat et al., 1981). Far-UV CD spectroscopy revealed a single unfolding transition between 6.5 and 7.5 M GdmCl (Figure 4C, open symbols). We then subjected the quenched unfolding reactions to analytical gel filtration at 25 C at the corresponding denaturant concentrations and separated intact pili and FimA oligomers from unfolded FimA monomers (Figure 4D). As observed for the FimGt%DSF complex, the generation of unfolded FimA monomers (Figure 4C, filled circles) coincided with the loss of native secondary structure. Our results show that subunit-subunit interactions in adhesive pili can be broken only upon unfolding of individual subunits and

demonstrate that adhesive pili, in practice, have infinite kinetic stability against unfolding and dissociation at zero denaturant and physiological conditions. They will thus never dissociate at infinite dilution (i.e., in the absence of free pilus subunits in the extracellular medium of a bacterial pathogen). X-Ray Structure of the FimGt%DSF Complex To elucidate the structural features underlying the high kinetic stability of the FimGt%DSF complex against unfolding and dissociation, we set out to determine its structure. Two different crys° tal forms (A and B) were obtained diffracting to 1.3 and 1.8 A, respectively. The structure of crystal form A was solved by MAD and contains one complex in the asymmetric unit, whereas crystal form B contains two of them (see Table 3 and Table S1 for data collection and refinement details). The three complexes are very similar, with root mean square deviations (Rmsds) smaller ° than 0.5 A over all modeled Ca atoms, suggesting that the structure is highly rigid. The FimGt%DSF complex exhibits an Ig-like fold typical for pilus subunits, in which the DSF peptide becomes a strand of one of the two b sheets (Figure 5A). As predicted from its nonequilibrium behavior in denaturant-dependent unfolding (Figure 3A), the DSF peptide indeed runs antiparallel to the C-terminal F-strand of

FimGt (Figures 5A and 5B). In both crystal forms, all FimGt residues correspond to good electron density, whereas this is the case for only 11 of the 15 residues of the DSF peptide (D2R12). Ala 1 and residues 13­15 are solvent exposed and disordered in the absence of crystal contacts. Secondary structure analysis with PROMOTIF (Hutchinson and Thornton, 1996) indicates that residues 3­12 of the DSF peptide are involved in ideal b sheet interactions, where each of these 10 residues shares two main-chain H-bonds with the A00 and F strands of FimGt (Figure 6A). In total, FimGt and the DSF peptide share 21 main chain and 5 side chain H bonds. The side chains of five DSF residues interact with the subunit core, and their positions are termed P1­P5, according to the nomenclature used for P pilus subunits (Sauer et al., 2002). Figure 6B shows that three large, hydrophobic donor strand residues (I5, I7, and V11) are filling deep hydrophobic pockets at positions P2, P3, and P5 of the FimGt cleft, whereas the two shallow binding sites at P1 and P4 are occupied by the smaller donor strand residues S3 and G9, respectively. An alignment of Nterminal donor strand extensions of type 1 pilus subunits (Figure 6D; see Figure S2 for the full alignment) reveals conserved properties of residues interacting with the hydrophobic core at positions P1­P5: large hydrophobic residues at P2, P3,

and P5 and a strict requirement for a glycine at P4 (also conserved in P pilus subunits; Sauer et al., 2002). At P1, a slight preference for a smaller residue (Gly or Ser) can be noticed. Such ``recognition motifs'' are observed for all pili assembled via the chaperone-usher pathway, and are pilus system specific (Remaut and Waksman, 2006). Further structural similarity to other pilus systems is revealed by comparison of the FimGt%DSF structure with the FimC%FimH complex (Choudhury et al., 1999; Figure 5D). The comparison, however, accentuates three major differences: (1) the G1 strand of FimC runs parallel to the F-strand of FimH, whereas DSF runs antiparallel; (2) the chaperone does not interact with FimH at P5; and (3) fewer backbone hydrogen bonds (14 versus 21) between the donor strand and the subunit are formed. The situation in P pili is very similar: the PapD chaperone donor strand occupies only positions P1­P4 in the PapDHis%PapENtd complex, whereas L9 of the KNte peptide occupies the P5 pocket in the PapENtd%KNte structure (Sauer et al., 2002). The alignment of type 1 pilus donor strand sequences (Figure 6D) suggests that the P5 position is occupied in all subunits after antiparallel donor strand insertion, as observed for FimGt%DSF, resulting in extension of the b sheet structure and thus stabilizing the complex. Another important determinant for the stability of pilus subunits is core packing. Zavialov et al. (2003) studied the interactions of two Yersinia pestis capsular F1 antigen subunits Caf1 with each other and with the chaperone Caf1M. They also measured the fit of the two b sheets of pilus subunits employing shape complementarity statistics (Sc) (Lawrence and Colman, 1993), a well-known geometric fit indicator for protein-protein interfaces: a Sc value of 0 indicates no geometrical fit, whereas a value of Sc = 1 denotes perfect fit. The calculated Sc values

for the packing of the two b sheets constituting a subunit are 0.71 for the Caf1%Caf1 complex and 0.72 for the PapENtd%KNte complex (Sauer et al., 2002; Zavialov et al., 2003). These values are significantly higher than those of the respective chaperone-subunit complexes, with Sc values in the range of 0.5 to 0.6. We calculated a Sc value of 0.78 for b sheet packing in the FimGt%DSF complex (Figure 6C depicts a portion of the b sheet-b sheet interface), whereas that for FimHP in the FimC%FimH structure is only 0.62. Thus, in full agreement with the observations on the Caf and the Pap systems, parallel insertion of the FimC donor strand keeps the subunits in an open, assembly-competent conformation, whereas antiparallel donor strand insertion leads to a collapse of the hydrophobic core, which contributes to the thermodynamic driving force of pilus assembly.

Specificity of Donor Strand Peptide Recognition To analyze the sequence specificity of the interaction between the DSF peptide and FimGt, we prepared complexes between FimGt and synthetic variants of DSF, in which the donor strand residues S3, I5, I7, G9, and V11, which interact at positions P1­P5 with FimG (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6D), were individually replaced by alanine residues. Figure 3D and Table 2 show that the individual alanine replacements decreased the kinetic stability against unfolding at pH 2.0 by 1­3 orders of magnitude, compared with that of the natural donor strand complex. The individual replacements I5A, G9A, and V11A in the FimF donor strand had the most destabilizing effect on the complexes with FimGt but still showed extrapolated half-lives of unfolding above eight years (Table 2). The observed rate constants of unfolding showed the same dependencies on denaturant concentration (kinetic m-values) as the wild-type complex (with deviation from linearity at high GdmCl concentration), indicating that the individual alanine substitutions in DSF had no effect on the transition states of unfolding. We also produced a complex between FimGt and the triple variant I5A/I7A/V11A of DSF. Relative to the complexes with single

alanine replacements in the donor strand peptide, the complex with the triple variant showed a strongly decreased kinetic stability against dissociation (t1/2 = 57 s at zero M GdmCl and pH 2.0) and a linear dependence of the observed unfolding rate on GdmCl concentration, with only a small kinetic m-value (Figure 3D). This change could result from either a shift of the transition state toward a less solvent accessible conformation or a change of the native state toward a more solvent accessible conformation. Together, the data demonstrate that all donor strand residues that bind to the pockets P1­P5 of FimG individually contribute to the kinetic stability of the FimGt%DSF complex and suggest high sequence-specificity in the recognition of donor strands by pilin domains. In summary, we believe that the surface complementarity between pilus subunit and the bound donor strand peptide, the compactness of the hydrophobic core of the subunit, and the length of the intermolecular b sheet (contiguous b sheet hydrogen bonds over 10 residues in the case of the FimGt%DSF complex) contribute to the high energy barrier that prevents unfolding and dissociation of pilin complexes.

(B) Slice view through FimGt (in gray surface representation): P1­P5 denote the positions where DSF side chains interact with the FimGt core. Large hydrophobic residues (Ile5, Ile7, and Val11 of DSF) reach deeply into the hydrophobic core in pockets at P2, P3, and P5. The small residue Gly9 fits in the shallow groove at P4 and thereby allows extension of the b sheet. (C) Stereo view of the hydrophobic core: the high shape complementarity of the two b sheets (Sc = 0.78) is accomplished via ``interdigitation'' of hydrophobic residues (labeled) that are conserved among type 1 pilus subunits. (D) Alignment of the N-terminal extensions (donor strands, DS) of type 1 pilus subunits and of the donor strand segment of the chaperone FimC (G1 strand of FimC, reversed sequence). A seed alignment of DSFimF and DSFimC was obtained by superimposing the FimC%FimH (Choudhury et al., 1999) and the FimGt%DSF (present study) structures and extended by aligning other type 1 pilus subunits sequences (FimF, FimA, and FimI) with CLUSTALW (Thompson et al., 1994; see Figure S2). Donor strand residues interacting at positions P1­P5 via their side chains are highlighted in red.

DISCUSSION The present study on donor strand complementation of the type 1 pilus subunits FimHP and FimGt demonstrates that antiparallel donor strand insertion is the basis of nonequilibrium folding behavior and the practically infinite kinetic stability of pilus subunit interactions against unfolding and dissociation. We have provided strong evidence that this mechanism is generally valid, because antiparallel insertion of different donor strand segments from pilus subunits cause nonequilibrium folding behavior of both FimHP and FimGt, and because the folding equilibrium can be attained only at high temperatures. This finding is consistent with a recent report on the self-complemented F1 pilus

subunit Caf1 with antiparallel donor strand insertion, where a temperature of 55 C had to be used to measure the equilibrium-folding transition (Zavialov et al., 2005). The only exception in our series of constructs with antiparallel donor strand orientation is FimHP-DSC, which shows reversible folding transitions at 25 C. The FimC donor strand segment, however, lacks the

invariant glycine at P4. This most likely prevents occupation of the P5 pocket in FimHP-DSC and leads to a less compact tertiary structure that shows reversible folding transitions and is significantly less stable against unfolding than FimHP-DSF, FimGtDSF, FimGt%DSF, and FimHP-DSG (Erilov et al., 2007). The folding and stability of bacterial pilus subunits with antiparallel donor strands is reminiscent of a set of proteins for which primarily kinetic and not thermodynamic processes determine the observed tertiary or quaternary structure. Prominent examples are (1) a-lytic protease and subtilisin, which both exhibit a very stable, native state that is kinetically not accessible in the absence of the respective pro region (Eder et al., 1993; Sohl et al., 1998); (2) serpins, which spontaneously fold to active serine proteinase inhibitors but then undergo a remarkable conformational transition to an inactive, but significantly more stable state (Whisstock and Bottomley, 2006); and (3) the heterodimeric ab protein luciferase where the b subunit folds autonomously to a very stable homodimer, but the a subunit does not fold and form the active ab heterodimer unless the a and b subunits are refolded together (reviewed in Baldwin et al., 1995). Another example is the synaptic SNARE complex, for which the assembled and dissociated states are also separated by huge kinetic barriers with an extrapolated dissociation half-life of about 109 years and which require external energy for dissociation (Fasshauer et al., 2002). The functional consequence of the high kinetic barriers for unfolding and dissociation of subunit-subunit complexes relative to chaperone-subunit complexes is that the assembly of pilus subunits becomes irreversible and that pili will never dissociate spontaneously under physiological conditions. In addition, dissociation of complexes between donor strand peptides and pilus subunits requires subunit unfolding. The FimGt%DSF complex analyzed in this study shows the most striking kinetic stability against unfolding/dissociation. Its extrapolated dissociation rate constant is 10 orders of magnitude below that of the avidin-biotin complex, which is generally considered the most stable protein-ligand complex (Piran and Riordan, 1990). Consequently, technical applications of the FimGt%DSF complex similar to those based on (strept)avidin-biotin complexes are conceivable, in particular because recognition of the DSF peptide by FimGt is sequence specific. The donor strand DSF forms a b sheet with the A and F strands of FimGt, whereby the hydrophobic amino acid side chains insert deeply into the hydrophobic core and make contacts with the second b sheet in a zipper-like manner. This interaction is reminiscent of the steric zipper found for the cross-b spine of amyloid-like fibrils (Nelson et al., 2005), which are also highly resistant against dissociation.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES For design of self-complemented variants, protein expression and purification, determination of protein and peptide concentrations, production of FimGt%DSF variants and the FimGt%FimC complex, and crystallization and structure determination of FimGt%DSF, see the Supplemental Data available with this article online. GdmCl-Dependent Unfolding/Refolding Transitions If not indicated otherwise, unfolding/refolding reactions were performed at 25 C in 10 mM Mops/NaOH (pH 7.0) and different GdmCl concentrations. For refolding transitions, proteins in 7 M GdmCl were rapidly diluted into

buffers containing different GdmCl concentrations. Folding transitions were measured by following the decrease in the far-UV CD signal at 210 nm (FimHP variants) or 230 nm (FimGt-DSF and FimGt%DSF) on a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter. The unfolding transition of FimHP-DSF was measured in a 0.2 mm quartz cuvette at 30 mM protein concentration; the refolding transition of FimHPDSF and unfolding/refolding of all other constructs (FimHP-DSC, DSF-FimHP, DSG-FimHP, FimGt-DSF, and FimGt%DSF) were measured in a 1 mm quartz cuvette at 10 mM protein concentration. Equilibrium-folding transitions of FimGt-DSF at 60 C and 65 C were measured at a protein concentration of 0.5 mM via the decrease in the fluorescence signal at 330 nm (excitation at 280 nm) on a QM-7/2003 spectrofluorimeter (PTI). The unfolding transition of the type 1 pilus rod was measured at a concentration corresponding to 10 mM FimA monomers after incubation for 20 hr at 60 C by following the decrease in the far-UV CD signal at 230 nm. Equilibrium transitions were fitted and normalized according to the twostate model (Santoro and Bolen, 1988). For evaluation of the GdmCl-induced folding transitions of FimHP and FimGt, the pretransition baseline was fixed to zero because of their very limited stability (transition midpoints below 1 M GdmCl). The nonequilibrium data were analyzed according to a two-state model with unattained equilibrium (Erilov et al., 2007) (see the Supplemental Data for a detailed description). Thermal Unfolding The equilibrium thermal unfolding transition of FimGt-DSF (10 mM) in 10 mM Mops/NaOH (pH 7.0) was monitored by the decrease in the far-UV CD signal at 230 nm with a heating rate of 0.2 C minÀ1 and was fitted according to the two-state model (Pace et al., 1998). Unfolding Kinetics Unfolding kinetics of FimGt-DSF, the FimGt%FimC complex (a FimC variant with wild-type activity, in which both Trp residues were exchanged by Tyr was used) (Vetsch et al., 2004), the complexes between FimGt and the different DSF variants, and intact type 1 pili were initiated by mixing one volume of protein solution (in 10 mM Mops/NaOH [pH 7.0]) with nine volumes of 30 mM Glycine/HCl (pH 2.0) containing different GdmCl concentrations at 25 C, with final protein concentrations of 0.5 mM (except for type 1 pili: 10 mM FimA monomers). Unfolding kinetics of the FimGt%FimC complex were measured on a SX-18MV stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter (Applied Photophysics) by monitoring the decrease in fluorescence at 330 nm with selective excitation of the tryptophan residue of FimGt at 295 nm. Unfolding kinetics of FimGt-DSF and complexes between FimGt and the DSF variants were measured after manual mixing via the decrease in fluorescence at 330 nm (excitation at 280 nm). Unfolding kinetics of type 1 pili were measured via the decrease in the far-UV CD signal at 230 nm. All unfolding reactions could be described with a monoexpoobs nential function. The fitting procedure for the relationship between lnkU and GdmCl is described in the Supplemental Data. Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography Samples of FimGt%DSF were incubated in GdmCl (5­7.5 M) 10 mM Mops/ NaOH (pH 7.0) for 20 hr at 25 C. Pili were incubated in GdmCl (5.5­8 M) 10 mM Mops/NaOH (pH 7.0) for 20 hr at 60 C. Samples were then applied to a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with identical buffers at 25 C. Peak areas in the elution profiles were determined with PeakFit (SPSS Inc.), corrected for the respective extinction coefficients, and converted into concentrations.
