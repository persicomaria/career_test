Penicillin acylase catalyses the condensation of Casubstituted phenylacetic acids with b-lactam nucleophiles, producing semi-synthetic b-lactam antibiotics. For efficient synthesis a low affinity for phenylacetic acid and a high affinity for Ca-substituted phenylacetic acid derivatives is desirable. We made three active site mutants, aF146Y, bF24A and aF146Y/bF24A, which all had a 2- to 10-fold higher affinity for Ca-substituted compounds than wildtype enzyme. In addition, bF24A had a 20-fold reduced affinity for phenylacetic acid. The molecular basis of the improved properties was investigated by X-ray crystallography. These studies showed that the higher affinity of aF146Y for (R)-a-methylphenylacetic acid can be explained by van der Waals interactions between aY146:OH and the Ca-substituent. The bF24A mutation causes an opening of the phenylacetic acid binding site. Only (R)-a-methylphenylacetic acid, but not phenylacetic acid, induces a conformation with the ligand tightly bound, explaining the weak binding of phenylacetic acid. A comparison of the bF24A structure with other open conformations of penicillin acylase showed that bF24 has a fixed position, whereas aF146 acts as a flexible lid on the binding site and reorients its position to achieve optimal substrate binding.

Introduction Penicillin acylase (PA) from Escherichia coli ATCC 11105 is a heterodimeric periplasmic protein consisting of a small a-subunit of 23 kDa and a large b-subunit of 62 kDa. The enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis of penicillin G to yield phenylacetic acid (PAA) and 6-aminopenicillanic acid, a building block of semi-synthetic b-lactam antibiotics (Bruggink et al., 1998). PA is of biotechnological interest because it catalyses the condensation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid and a synthetically produced acyl donor, to produce semi-synthetic b-lactam antibiotics (Arroyo et al., 2003). The proposed catalytic cycle starts with a nucleophilic attack by the hydroxyl group of the active-site serine, bS1, on the carbonyl carbon atom of the amide or ester bond of the substrate (the amino acid residues are labelled to indicate the polypeptide chain, a or b, and the residue number in this chain) (Duggleby et al., 1995).

Via a tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate an acyl-enzyme is formed concomitant with the departure of the leaving group. The acyl-enzyme can subsequently be deacylated by a b-lactam nucleophile yielding a semi-synthetic b-lactam antibiotic, or by H2O, resulting in the hydrolysis product. The synthetic acyl donors that are used in the synthesis of semi-synthetic b-lactam antibiotics are in general activated PAA derivatives that carry substituents on the Ca position or on the phenyl ring. For instance, for the synthesis of ampicillin and amoxicillin, amides or esters of a-aminophenylacetic acid (phenylglycine) and p-hydroxy-a-aminophenylacetic acid (p-hydroxyphenylglycine) are used, respectively. The production of cefamandole requires the use of activated a-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (mandelic acid). Unfortunately, the Km values of PA for the conversion of these derivatives are in the order of 10­100 mM, which is 100- to 1000-fold higher than the Km values for substrates with phenylacetic acid as the acyl group (Margolin et al., 1980; Svedas et al., 1996; Alkema et al., 1999; Lummer et al., 1999). A higher affinity of PA for synthetic acyl donors would therefore be desirable for maintaining a high activity at low substrate concentrations. A second requirement for high enzyme activity is a low affinity for PAA, which is a strong inhibitor of penicillin acylase and may be present in preparations of 6-aminopenicillanic acid derived from penicillin G. The 3D structure of the enzyme with bound PAA revealed that the acyl binding site is a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of aM142, aF146, bF24, bV56 and bI177 (Duggleby et al., 1995). One oxygen atom of the carboxylate group of PAA interacts with the oxyanion-hole residues bN241 and bA69. Binding of para- and meta-substituted phenylacetic acid derivatives causes the enzyme to switch from a closed to an open active site conformation (Done et al., 1998; Alkema et al., 2000; McVey et al., 2001). In the open conformation, aR145 and aF146 have moved away from the active site, creating more space in the acyl binding site. Kinetic studies with Ca-substituted phenylacetic acid derivatives have shown that the substrate binding site can accommodate small hydrophobic substituents, but that large and polar substituents bind only with low affinity (Svedas et al., 1996). However, no structural information is available on the binding of these compounds. To identify the factors that play a role in the binding of synthetic acyl donors, we carried out kinetic and crystallographic studies of wild-type enzyme and the active-site mutants bF24A and aF146Y, which were found to have an increased affinity for PAA derivatives with an NH2 group at the Ca position. The results show that the kinetic properties of the bF24A mutant can be explained by the enzyme adopting two distinct stabilizing conformations upon binding of PAA and (R)-a-methylphenylacetic acid. The aF146Y mutation introduces van der Waals interactions that stabilize the binding of (R)-a-methylphenylacetic acid. 473

Materials and methods

Crystallization of wild-type and mutant penicillin acylases
Site-directed mutants were constructed as described (Alkema et al., 2002a). The double mutant aF146Y/bF24A was made by isolating the EcoRV­ClaI fragment of the penicillin acylase gene containing the aF146Y mutation and subsequent cloning of this fragment in the plasmid carrying the bF24A mutation. Purified wild-type and mutant enzymes were obtained as described (Alkema et al., 2000). Crystals of wild-type, aF146Y and bF24A PA were grown at 4 C using the hanging-drop vapour diffusion set-up combined with streak seeding. Drops of 6 ml were prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein [4­10 mg/ml protein in 50 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer, pH 7.2] and reservoir solution [50 mM MOPS buffer, pH 7.2, 12­20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethylether 2000 (PEG MME 2k) (Sigma)]. Crystals appeared in 1­2 days and reached typical sizes of 0.2 · 0.15 · 0.1 mm. Crystals of wild-type and mutant enzymes complexed with PAA and (R)-a-methylphenylacetic acid (MPAA) were obtained by co-crystallization in the presence of 2.5 mM PAA and MPAA, respectively. Prior to data collection, the crystals were transferred to a solution of 20% (w/v) PEG MME 2k, 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. The crystals were flash frozen using 35% (w/v) PEG MME 2k and 7.5% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant. For the ligand binding studies, these solutions contained 2.5 mM PAA or MPAA.

rotating anode X-ray generator. Data were integrated and reduced with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). The intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes and brought to absolute scale with TRUNCATE from the CCP4 package (CCP4, 1994). The structures were refined using CNS (Brnger et al., 1998) alteru nated with minor manual model building using O (Jones et al., 1991) and Quanta (Accelrys). Bulk solvent correction and overall anisotropic B-factor scaling were applied. Ligands were identified and modelled in the active site. For PAA in the bF24A enzyme, the density suggested multiple conformations, of which the most prominent one was modelled. Final rounds of refinement were performed with REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1999), alternated with ARP/wARP (Lamzin et al., 1999) to analyse water molecules. The quality of the structures was validated using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and programs from the CCP4 suite (CCP4, 1994). The final models consist of residues a3­a208, b1­b557, one calcium ion, a variable number of water molecules and ligands where appropriate. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.

Determination of binding constants
The binding constants for the inhibitors and substrates were determined by measuring Kmapp for the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate D-2-nitro-5-[(phenylglycyl)amino]benzoic acid (NIPGB) in the presence of varying substrate and inhibitor concentrations. Inhibition by PAA and phenylacetamide was shown to be competitive and it was assumed that inhibition by the other PAA derivatives was also competitive, because of the similar binding of these compounds in the PAA binding site (Svedas et al., 1996). The rate of hydrolysis (V ) of a coloured

Binding constants for PAA derivatives
The objective of this study was to obtain insight into the factors that play a role in the binding of Ca-substituted compounds to penicillin acylase (PA). To this end we determined the binding constants of various PAA derivatives with distinct substituents at the Ca position, varying in size, polarity and ability to accept or donate hydrogen bonds. For these experiments wild-type and the two active site mutants aF146Y and bF24A were used, in addition to the double mutant aF146Y/bF24A. In the wild-type enzyme, aF146 and bF24 line the acyl binding pocket in the active site (Duggleby et al., 1995; Done et al., 1998; McVey et al., 2001; Alkema et al., 2002a; Morillas et al., 2003). They play a role in substrate binding through hydrophobic interactions with the phenyl ring of the substrate. Previous studies have shown that the bF24A and aF146Y mutants have increased affinities for phenylglycine methyl ester and phenylglycinamide, which are used for the production of ampicillin (Alkema et al., 2002a). The wild-type enzyme had a Ki for PAA of 0.06 mM and showed a decreasing affinity with increasing size and polarity of the Ca substituent (Table II). A methyl group on the Ca position led to a 10-fold reduced affinity, whereas an OH group caused a more than 200-fold reduced affinity. The zwitterionic phenylglycine did not inhibit the enzyme, indicating that a

Inhibition experiments were carried out with [S] ( Km so that the determination of Ki is independent on the precise knowledge of Km and [S], reducing the experimental error in the measurements. If I is an inhibitor, Ki is equal to the binding constant for binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme. If I is a substrate, Ki is equal to Km of that substrate. For phenylglycinamide and phenylacetamide, the Km values are equal to the dissociation constants Ks, since the step leading to the formation of the covalent intermediate is strongly rate limiting (Alkema et al., 2003). All experiments were carried out at 30 C, pH 7.0, in 50 mM phosphate buffer.

positive charge on the Ca position prevents the ligand from binding in the apolar active site. Increasing the size of the Ca-substituent from a methyl to an ethyl group led to a more than 10-fold reduced affinity. Interestingly, whereas the enzyme was enantioselective (determined as KiR/KiS) for the R-enantiomer of a-methylphenylacetic acid, it had an opposite enantioselectivity for the low affinity inhibitors aethyl- and a-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. Overall, these results show that substrate specificity and enantioselectivity of the wild-type enzyme are determined both by the size and by the polarity of the substituent at the Ca position, in agreement with results that were obtained by Svedas et al. (1996). The Ki values of the bF24A mutant for the various compounds differed significantly from those of the wild-type. The most striking difference was that the bF24A mutant had a 20-fold increased Ki value for PAA, whereas Ki for PAA derivatives with a substituent at the Ca position ranged from values equal to wild-type values to values up to 10-fold lower compared with the wild-type enzyme. The substrate with a Caamino group, phenylglycinamide, was also bound with higher affinity to the mutant enzyme, in contrast to the 10-fold decreased affinity for phenylacetamide, which contains no substituent at the Ca position. These findings suggest that a substituent at the Ca position of PAA is necessary for tight binding of the ligand to the bF24A active site. Furthermore, the mutant enzyme had, compared with the wild-type, a higher enantioselectivity for the R-enantiomers of all ligands, indicating that the side chain of the residue at position b24 strongly influences the enantioselectivity of PA. The aF146Y mutant enzyme showed an increased affinity for all compounds tested. The largest effect was observed with phenylglycinamide, for which a 10-fold increased affinity was found. The increased affinity of the aF146Y mutant for PAA derivatives did not depend on the type of Ca-substituent and the enantioselectivity for all compounds was similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. In the double mutant aF146Y/bF24A, approximate additivity of the effects of the single mutations was observed. The affinity for a-methylphenylacetic acid and a-ethylphenylacetic acid was higher than the affinity of both single mutants. For the other Ca-substituted ligands, the Ki values averaged those of the single mutants with the exception of PAA, for which the aF146Y/bF24A mutant showed the same low affinity as the single bF24A mutant. As a result, the double mutant had a 44-fold increased preference for phenylglycinamide over PAA (KiPGA/KiPAA = 0.07), compared with the wild-type (KiPGA/ KiPAA = 0.0015).

active site residues and the ligand are necessary to accommodate the methyl substituent at the Ca position. For instance, the Ca carbon atom of MPAA shifts by 1.1 s towards the phenyl ring of aF146, and the phenyl rings of aF146 and bF24, on both sides of the Ca atom, move by 0.5 s. In this way the methyl group of MPAA comes at van der Waals distance from bF24:Cd1 (3.6 s) and aF146:Ce2 (3.5 s) and is also close to bS1:Og (3.2 s) and bQ23:O (3.0 s) (Figure 1). Since the MPAA Ca­CH3 bond is directed towards bF24:Ca, with the methyl carbon atom at 4.1 s from bF24: Ca, accommodation of a larger ethyl group is not possible without conformational changes of the protein or a different binding mode of the ligand. Thus, (R)-a-ethylphenylacetic acid cannot bind in the active site in a similar way to MPAA. Likewise, the ethyl substituent of (S)-a-ethylphenylacetic would come too close to aF146 to be accommodated without conformational changes. The 10-fold lower affinity for aethylphenylacetic acid compared with a-methylphenylacetic acid and the reversal of enantioselectivity from 2.7 for the wild-type to 0.36 for the bF24A mutant confirm that an ethyl substituent is not easily accommodated in the active site. The structure suggests that residues aF146 and bF24 limit the allowed size of the Ca-substituent. The apolar nature of these residues, together with the overall hydrophobic character of the acyl-binding pocket, also explains the enzyme's low affinity for substrates with polar substituents (Table II).

Structure of bF24A
The affinity of PA for (R)-methyl- and (R)-ethyl-PAA can be increased by removing the aromatic ring of residue bF24 (see Table II). To ascertain the structural basis of this increased affinity, we determined the crystal structures of bF24A PA and its complexes with PAA and MPAA (Figure 2). In these structures, the active-site and oxyanion-hole residues bS1, bA69 and bN241 occupy almost the same position as in the wild-type enzyme, and also the loop-containing residue bF24 has hardly undergone positional rearrangements. In contrast, residues aN144­aF146 and bY31 show considerable differences. The a-helical conformation of aN144­aF146 is distorted. As a result, residues aR145 and aF146 have moved away, creating a more open and accessible active site. Residue bY31 has moved towards the acyl binding pocket and occupies some of the space created by the bF24A mutation. The more open active site of the bF24A mutant is very similar to the open conformation that was observed in the enzyme­penicillin G complex and in enzyme complexes with disubstituted phenylacetic acids (Done et al., 1998; Alkema et al., 2000). Binding of PAA in the active site of bF24A penicillin acylase leaves the open conformation of the empty bF24A enzyme intact. Interestingly, the positions of both the phenyl ring and the carboxylate moiety of PAA are different from those in the wild-type enzyme (Figure 2B). Although the electron density indicates that PAA is present in more than one conformation, it is clear that the compound has lost the hydrogen bonds with the oxyanion-hole atoms bA69:N (at 4.2 s distance) and bN241:Nd2 (5.2 s) that were observed in the wild-type enzyme. The hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of aM142 and aF146 are also not conserved. The loss of binding interactions is in agreement with the 20-fold reduced affinity of this mutant for PAA (Table II). In contrast, the affinity of the bF24A mutant enzyme for MPAA is higher than that of wild-type PA (Table II). The

Structure of wild-type enzyme co-crystallized with MPAA
The kinetic data for the wild-type enzyme showed that substituents at the Ca atom of PAA result in a decreased affinity and that the stereoselectivity of the enzyme is dependent on the type of substituent at the Ca position. To obtain a structural explanation for these observations, we determined the crystal structure of wild-type penicillin acylase in a complex with (R)-a-methylphenylacetic acid (MPAA). This structure revealed that MPAA is bound in the acyl binding site of the enzyme, where it is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of aM142, bF146, bF24 and bI177, and by hydrogen bonds with bA69:N and bN241:Nd2 (Figure 1). The mode of MPAA binding is similar to that reported previously for PAA (Duggleby et al., 1995), but small shifts of the 476

The most important interactions between the enzyme and the Ca substituent are given with dashed lines. (B) Superposition of the structures of wild-type complexed with MPAA (black bonds) and PAA (open bonds). PAA and MPAA bind in essentially the same way to the wild-type enzyme, but a small positional shift of MPAA, aF146 and bF24 is necessary to accommodate the extra methyl group in MPAA in the active site. All figures were prepared using Molscript (Kraulis, 1991) and Bobscript (Esnouf, 1997).

crystal structure of this PA mutant with MPAA bound in the active site reveals that the open conformation of the bF24A and bF24A­PAA structures is not present in the bF24A­MPAA complex. Instead, MPAA is bound in a very similar way to that in the wild-type enzyme (Figure 2C) with aF146 moved in to cover the acyl binding site. MPAA has moved about 0.6 s towards bA24:CB, occupying part of the space created by the bF24A mutation. Although bY31 also takes some of the space caused by the mutation, sufficient space remains to accommodate an ethyl group or an even larger substituent. This suggests that whereas a-methylphenylacetic acid and a-ethylphenylacetic acid have different binding modes in the wild-type enzyme, they bind in a similar way in the bF24A mutant. This is corroborated by the kinetic data, which show that the two substrates bind with similar affinities and enantioselectivities to the bF24A mutant. Based on kinetic data, it was concluded that a Ca-substituent is necessary for tight binding of a ligand in the bF24A active site. The structural data show that tight binding is correlated with a switch from the open to the closed conformation. This leads to restored hydrophobic enzyme­ligand contacts with residues from the acyl-binding site and restored hydrogen

bonds of the substrate carbonyl oxygen with the oxyanionhole residues. A similar correlation between the Ki values and the presence of an open or closed conformation has been observed for the binding of para- and meta-substituted phenylacetic acids to PA (Done et al., 1998), supporting the functional relevance of the observed conformational changes for the enzyme's substrate preferences.

Structure of aF146Y co-crystallized with MPAA
The aF146Y mutant enzyme has an increased affinity for PAA and the Ca-substituted derivatives tested. The crystal structure of this mutant with bound MPAA shows that MPAA binds in a similar way to the enzyme as to the wild-type and the bF24A mutant. The additional OH group in the aF146Y mutant is accommodated without conformational changes of the protein or the ligand. It has van der Waals contacts with aR145:NH2 and the Ca-substituent of the ligand, and makes a watermediated hydrogen bond to Q23:O (Figure 3). The Ca­CH3 bond of MPAA and the CZ­OH bond of aY146 are directed parallel to each other. This precludes hydrogen bond formation in case of an OH or NH2 substituent at the Ca position, assuming that no conformational rearrangements take place. The 477

increased affinity of the aF146Y mutant for the R-enantiomers of the PAA derivatives may therefore be due to the added van der Waals interactions between aY146:OH and the Ca substituent.

Interaction of the aF146Y/bF24A double mutant with ligands
On the basis of the crystal structures of the single mutants and the wild-type enzyme, a structural explanation for some of the 478

properties of the aF146Y/bF24A double mutant can be deduced. This mutant has the same low affinity for PAA and phenylacetamide as the bF24A mutant, whereas the affinity for the Ca-substituted ligands a-methylphenylacetic acid and a-ethylphenylacetic acid is 3- to 10-fold higher than the wild-type enzyme. This suggests that the same open and closed forms regulate ligand binding as observed for the bF24A mutant. For a-methylphenylacetic acid, which binds to the

closed form, the affinity of the double mutant is higher than the affinity of each of the single mutants, indicating that the effects of the single mutations are additive. The combination of the lower steric hindrance caused by the bF24A mutation and the improved enzyme­ligand interactions of the aF146Y mutant thus results in an almost 10-fold increased affinity of the aF146Y/bF24A double mutant for a-methylphenylacetic acid compared with the wild-type enzyme (Table II).

Structural comparison of open conformations
The data presented here show that ligand-induced structural rearrangements of the active site of PA play an important role in ligand binding. This is evident, for example, from the transition from an open to a closed active site that the bF24A mutant undergoes upon binding of a-methylphenylacetic acid. Similarly, binding of penicillin G and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid to the wild-type enzyme cause the enzyme to switch from the closed to the open conformation (Done et al., 1998; Alkema et al., 2000; Morillas et al., 2003). Superposition of these open and closed conformations shows that in all cases the conformational change involves the movement of the same two residues, aR145 and aF146, whereas the other residues of the acyl binding site, e.g. aM142, bF24, bV56, and bS67, and the catalytic bS1 do not change position (Figure 4). In all open structures the side chain of aR145 occupies the same position, making a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of bF460. In the structure with penicillin G and the empty bF24A structure, an additional water-mediated H-bond to aD68:OD2 further stabilizes the side chain of this residue. The side chain of aR145 also assists in transition-state stabilization in the hydrolysis of penicillin G by the formation of a hydrogen bond between aR145:NH1 and the carboxylate group of the thiazolidine ring of the 6-APA group (Alkema et al., 2002b). The fact that the same position is occupied by aR145, irrespective of whether the open conformation is caused by a mutation in the enzyme, or by binding a substrate or inhibitor, indicates that this open conformation corresponds to a distinct low-energy conformation of the enzyme, in line with suggestions made by Done et al. (1998).

Fig. 4. Comparison of structures of PA in the open and closed conformation. The open conformations are induced by binding of the substrate penicillin G (white), binding of the inhibitor 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dark grey) and the bF24A mutation (light grey). The closed conformation of the wild-type enzyme complexed with PAA is shown in black. In all open conformations aR145 occupies the same position, in which the side chain is stabilized by hydrogen bonding to bF460:O, mediated by a water molecule (Wat). The side chain of aF146 can adopt multiple conformations dependent on the type of ligand that is bound in the active site. The positions of the residues in the catalytic centre, bS1, bA69 and bN241 and in the acyl binding site bF24, bV56 and bS67 are not affected by the conformational change.

In contrast to the well-defined open position of the side chain of aR145, the side chain of aF146 has multiple conformations (Figure 4), depending on the nature of the bound ligands. In the enzyme­penicillin G complex the phenyl ring has van der Waals contacts with the b-lactam moiety of the substrate. In the complexes with substituted phenylacetic acids, the phenyl 479

ring shifts to give an optimal configuration for aromatic­ aromatic interactions (Done et al., 1998). The plasticity of aF146 provides an explanation for the ability of (S)a-ethylphenylacetic acid still to bind to the enzyme, even though the structure of the wild-type enzyme shows that steric hindrance with aF146 would occur. The conformational change in PA seems to serve two purposes. One function is to create additional space in the active site to allow binding of substrates and inhibitors that do not fit in the pre-aligned active site. Second, aF146 and aR145 reorient to provide additional substrate binding interactions. The kinetic and structural data presented in this paper have provided insight into the binding of Ca-substituted phenylacetic acids, which are used as acyl donors in the synthesis of semi-synthetic b-lactam antibiotics. Our results show that the size of the substituent and hydrophobicity of the active site and also induced fit mechanisms are the major determinants for substrate specificity in PA. The double mutant aF146Y/bF24A showed a 20-fold reduced inhibition by PAA and an almost 3-fold increased specificity for the substrate phenylglycinamide, indicating that site-directed mutagenesis is a promising way to tailor enzymatic activity towards synthetic substrates that are used in the production of b-lactam antibiotics.
