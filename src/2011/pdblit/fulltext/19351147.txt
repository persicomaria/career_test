ABSTRACT

r, -Difluoromethylene deoxynucleoside 5-triphosphates (dNTPs, N ) A or C) are advantageously obtained via phosphorylation of corresponding dNDP analogues using catalytic ATP, PEP, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, and pyruvate kinase. DNA pol Kd values for the r, -CF2 and unmodified dNTPs, r, -NH dUTP, and the r, -CH2 analogues of dATP and dGTP are discussed in relation to the conformations of r, -CF2 dTTP versus r, -NH dUTP bound into the enzyme active site.

In an ongoing multidisciplinary study of structure and function of DNA polymerase , a eukaryotic enzyme primarily involved in filling short DNA gaps,1 we required a series of R, -methylenesubstituted analogues of deoxynucleoside 5-triphosphates (dNTPs). When the PR-O-P bridging oxygen in a natural mononucleotide substrate is replaced by an imido (NH)2-4 or methylene (CXY)4,5 group, the P-N or P-C bond should resist cleavage in the nucleotidyl transfer reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. As a result, these analogues will remain intact in stable ternary DNA complexes with the polymerase and therefore should be useful to probe pre-chemistry enzyme-complex function

tions, by making appropriate substitutions X,Y on the adjacent PR CXY bridging carbon. The largest obtainable electron-withdrawing effect with minimal steric perturbation can be achieved using X,Y ) F, resulting in analogues in which the bisphosphonate group is expected to be less basic than the pyrophosphate moiety in the natural dNTPs.8,9 In this Letter, we describe the first synthesis of R, -CF2 dCTP 6, using a modified chemical-enzymological approach that also can be applied to synthesis of R, -CF2 dATP 3, affording these compounds in sufficient purity to virtually eliminate detectable contaminating substrate activity in polymerase inhibition kinetics assays. DNA pol Kd values were determined for these analogues and compared to Kd values for R, -CF2 dTTP 9, the natural substrates dATP, dCTP and dTTP, R, -NH dUTP 10, and the dATP and dGTP R, -CH2 analogues (11, 12). We also describe the ternary complex of 9 bound with template-primer DNA into the active site of DNA polymerase , as determined by X-ray crystallography, and discuss its structural implications. An obvious route to R, -methylene-dNTP analogues entails coupling a particular methylenebis(phosphonate) derivative to the target nucleoside, followed by phosphorylation10 to add the terminal -phosphate. Several R, -CXY NDPs (X,Y ) H or F) were previously synthesized via tosylation of the 5-OH in the protected ribonucleoside with tosyl chloride and (dimethylamino)pyridine, followed by deprotection and displacement of the tosyl moiety with the appropriate tris(tetrabutylammonium)11 bisphosphonate. A similar approach was used to prepare an R, -CF2 dGDP (N2-(pN-n-butylphenyl) derivative),12 dATP and dTTP,13 and related nucleotide analogues.14 In a synthesis of AZT 5-carbonylbis(phosphonate), trimethyl (diazomethylene)bis(phosphonate) was coupled to AZT under Mitsunobu conditions, but subsequent deprotection (demethylation) at phosphorus was required.15 Direct 5-coupling of 2-6 equiv of methylenebis(phosphonic dichloride) with unprotected nucleosides also has been demonstrated.16 Chemical phosphorylation of R, -CH2 dADP and dTDP has been carried out via the p-nitrobenzyl-phosphoromorpholidates.13 Unfortunately, subsequent deprotection by hydrogenolysis of the p-nitrobenzyl group restricts the pyrimidine substrate, because the cytosine ring of dC is prone to reduction under these conditions.17 Side products from the phosphorylation step typically contaminate

the R, -methylene dNTP analogue product. Carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) activation18 of the dGDP derivative referred to above has been utilized as an alternative route.12 We found phosphorylation of our dNDP substrates using CDI to be problematic because of the reactivity of the imidazolate, which tended to give unwanted nucleoside phosphorylation at the 3-OH and other side products. As an alternative to syntheses of R, -imido dNTPs using CDI to activate the NDP analogue for coupling with tributylammonium phosphate,3,19 Kenyon proposed enzymatic phosphorylation by either creatine kinase (CK)2,19 or pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).19 However, inadequate CK and PK activity in attempted PEP phosphorylation of our dNDP intermediates led us to consider adaptation of a method for phosphorylation of azole carboxamide riboxynucleoside 5-diphosphates (NDPs) by  stoichiometric ATP and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK)20a previously applied to synthesis of 11,20b in which PEP and PK are included to recycle the ADP produced in the phosphoryl transfer and drive the reaction to completion. Synthesis of r, -dNTPs. We first converted dA or N4benzoyl-dC 7 to the corresponding 5-tosylates 1 or 4, respectively (see Scheme 1), by reaction with tosyl chloride in pyridine (75-80%).13

Note: before tosylation, dC was converted to N4-Bz-deoxycytidine 7 with benzoic anhydride, DIEA in pyridine, microwave irradiation (2 min, 300 W). Prior to the enzymatic phosphorylation, the N4-protected dCDP analogue 8 obtained directly from 4 was debenzoylated to 5 using methanolic ammonia.

The NH2 group of dC was protected via facile microwaveinduced reaction with benzoic anhydride and diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) in pyridine,21 to give 7 (76%). When purifying 4 from the reaction mixture, we initially used conventional extraction with aq NaHCO3 (pH 8.3) but obtained low isolated yields (20%). The pKa of the N4-proton in 4 was estimated (ACDLabs pKaDB 8.01 software program) to be 8. Accordingly, we changed to a slightly acidic aqueous workup (citric acid buffer, pH 4.5), which increased the isolated yield to 70%. The purified tosylates were converted to the dNDP R, difluoromethylene analogues 2 or 5 via condensation with the tris(tetrabutylammonium) salt13 of difluoromethylenebis(phosphonic acid) (DFBP). The N4-benzoyl dCDP analogue 8 obtained as the direct tosylation product from 4 was then deprotected in methanolic ammonia to give 5 quantitatively, which was purified by preparative ion-exchange HPLC. DFBP was obtained by

bromotrimethylsilane dealkylation22 of tetra-isopropyl (difluoro)methylenebis(phosphonate),8 synthesized by fluorination of the carbanion of tetra-isopropyl methylenebis(phosphonate).7,23 Phosphorylation to the dNTP analogues 3 or 6 was cleanly achieved using NDPK and a catalytic amount of ATP, regenerated with 2.5 equiv of PEP with PK in 50 mM HEPES buffer (75-90% by HPLC and 31P NMR). Importantly, the latter modification renders unnecessary the use of an affinity column20 to purify the product from excess ATP. Purification of r, -dNTPs. To obtain product free of detectable nucleotide contaminants, we found that separation on DEAE Sephadex or Dowex3,5,9,12-14,24-30 or single-pass preparative HPLC using a C-18 or ionexchange3,5,9,12-14,24-31 column was not sufficient. However, dual-HPLC (ion exchange, then C-18) provided highly purified products based on analytical HPLC and 1H, 31 P, and 19F NMR analysis (Supporting Information). This overall synthesis/purification route has the advantage of being applicable to both purine and pyrimidine examples, including the previously unavailable R, -CF2 dCTP analogue 6. The reactions are relatively clean (particularly compared to standard CDI phosphorylation), do not require protection/deprotection chemistry in the phosphate moieties, eliminate the problem of excess ATP in the enzymatic phosphorylation, and after the dual-HPLC purification provide exceptionally pure analogues suitable for polymerase inhibition studies (see below). The dual-HPLC purification protocol was also effective in reducing impurities in R, -CF2 dTTP 9 prepared by the p-nitrobenzyl-phosphomorpholidate method (see below). DNA Synthesis Assays. DNA synthesis was assayed on four single-nucleotide gapped DNA substrates where the templating base in the gap was complementary to the incoming dNTP. The DNA sequence was as described previously32 with the core sequence identical to that used for crystallization.

Initial DNA polymerase inhibition studies on R, -CF2 dCTP, 6 at 1 mM showed no detectable background DNA synthesis with 0.5 nM enzyme, and only a trace with 50 nM enzyme, representing <0.01% of the inhibitor (Figure 1A). Comparable absence of

The mobility of the extension product (n + 1) with dCTP, dATP, or dTTP serves as a reference, where most of the primer (200 nM) is extended after a 21 min incubation with 50 nM enzyme and 100 µM dNTP.

background synthesis was evident in the assay using R, -CF2 dATP, 3 (Figure 1B). For comparison, with a preparation of inhibitor 9 obtained via the p-nitrobenzyl phosphoromorpholidate method, at 50 nM pol most of the primer strand in the assay has been extended, with some incorporation still detectable using the lower concentration of enzyme (Figure 1B). After dual-HPLC purification, this artifact was no longer observable with 0.5 nM enzyme, although incorporation at 50 nM enzyme was more evident than for 6 and 3 (Supporting Information). Inhibition of natural nucleotide insertion by the different R, modified dNTP analogues was investigated at various concentrations of inhibitor (I) and subsaturating dNTP substrate (S). Steadystate kinetic parameters (km, Km) were determined by fitting the rate data to the Michaelis equation, and the inhibitor constant Ki ()Kd) was determined by fitting the inhibition data to the equation for competitive inhibition (Supporting Information). Both fits used nonlinear regression methods. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) for the natural dNTPs were taken from previously published data [dATP;33 dCTP;34 dTTP35]. The Ki's for 10, 11, and 12 were reported previously.6,36 The CF2-analogues readily inhibit pol single-nucleotide insertion (Figure 2). However, their binding affinities are at least

dehydrogenase, the Km of the R-CF2 analogue was an order of magnitude greater than the Km of glucose 6-phosphate, but that of the R-CH2 derivative was also higher (4-fold).38 Crystallization and Analysis of r, -Modified dNTP Analogues Complexed with DNA Primer and DNA pol . The crystal structure of the ternary complex of pol with the incoming analogue 9 opposite dA represents the precatalytic state of the nucleotidyl transfer reaction for correct incorporation, containing all atoms required for catalysis including the two catalytic metal ions. As expected, the substitution of the CF2 for the bridging oxygen prevented dissociation of the pyrophosphate leaving group, trapping the complex. All correlated atoms in the active site of this structure superimpose well with previously determined ternary complex structures of pol where the reaction was trapped by deletion of the nucleophilic 3-OH on the primer terminus39 or by using a nitrogen in place of the R, bridging oxygen1,4,6 (Figure 3). In summary, we have synthesized a series of R, -CF2 dNTP analogues. Two of these, 3 and 6, were synthesized by an advantageous chemical-enzymatic method that was used to obtain the previously unavailable dCTP analogue, 6.40 The isolation method provides the inhibitors essentially free of contaminating "dNTP" activity. Kd values for these and comparable analogues, combined with an X-ray crystallographic study of 9 bound into a pol ternary complex, indicate that CXY modification in the PR-O-P bridging position of dNTPs where X,Y ) F or H can modulate binding properties over a wide range of Kd while substantially retaining a dNTP-like conformation.
