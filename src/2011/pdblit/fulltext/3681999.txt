Many bacteriophages, such as T4, T7, RB49, and f29, have complex, sometimes multilayered, tails that facilitate an almost 100% success rate for the viral particles to infect host cells. In bacteriophage T4, there is a baseplate, which is a multiprotein assembly, at the distal end of the contractile tail. The baseplate communicates to the tail that the phage fibers have attached to the host cell, thereby initiating the infection process. Gene product 8 (gp8), whose amino acid sequence consists of 334 residues, is one of at least 16 different structural proteins that constitute the T4 baseplate and is the sixth baseplate protein whose structure has been determined. A ° 2.0 A resolution X-ray structure of gp8 shows that the two-domain protein forms a dimer, in which each monomer consists of a three-layered b-sandwich with two loops, each containing an a-helix at the opposite sides of the sandwich. The crystals of gp8 were produced in the presence of concentrated chloride and bromide ions, resulting in at least 11 halidebinding sites per monomer. Five halide sites, situated at the N termini of a-helices, have a protein environment observed in other halide-containing protein crystal structures. The computer programs EMfit and SITUS were ° used to determine the positions of six gp8 dimers within the 12 A resolution cryo-electron microscopy image reconstruction of the baseplate-tail tube complex. The gp8 dimers were found to be located in the upper part of the baseplate outer rim. About 20% of the gp8 surface is involved in contacts with other baseplate proteins, presumed to be gp6, gp7, and gp10. With the structure determination of gp8, a total of 53% of the volume of the baseplate has now been interpreted in terms of its atomic structure.

Introduction
Bacteriophage T4 consists of a prolate head containing a 172 kb, genomic DNA and a bilayered contractile tail that has a hexagonal baseplate and fibers at its distal end.1 The phage initiates infection of an Escherichia coli bacterium by recognizing lipopolysaccharide cell-surface receptors with the distal ends of its long tail fibers.2 The recognition ° signal is then transmitted through the 1450 A long tail fibers to gene product 9 (gp9) in the baseplate,3 triggering a large conformational

change in which the baseplate switches from a hexagonal to a star shape.4 In this process, the short tail fibers unravel from underneath the baseplate and bind to the lipopolysaccharides irreversibly, anchoring the baseplate to the cell membrane securely. Subsequently, the tail sheath contracts and the rigid tail tube penetrates the outer cell membrane and peptidoglycan cell wall, aided by the hub protein gp5, which consists, in part, of a pointed membrane-puncturing needle and of a lysozyme domain.5 As the tail sheath contraction progresses, the tail tube spans the outer membrane and periplasmic space, finally coming in contact with the cytoplasmic cell membrane, allowing the phage DNA to be injected into the host cell through the tube. The baseplate contains at least 16 different

proteins, many of which are oligomeric.3,5 ­ 8 These proteins form six identical wedges that join around the central hub with the help of proteins gp9 and gp12. The baseplate hub serves as a starting point for polymerization of the tail tube, which is composed of 144 copies of gp19 and terminated by gp3.9 Assembly of the baseplate starts from interactions between proteins forming its outer edge and proceeds towards the center, where the wedges come into contact with the hub. The assembly pathway is strictly ordered so that, for example, the formation of the complex between gp10 and gp7 is followed by attachment of gp8.10 Although only the long and short tail fibers were shown to interact with the host cell receptors,11,12 mutations in several baseplate proteins, including gp8, can influence the host preference of T4 for different strains of E. coli.13 In vitro complementation assay and complex formation analyses,14 ­ 19 near-neighbor contact studies and electron with cross-linking agents,20 microscopy images of negatively stained samples4 have provided a low-resolution model of the baseplate, which established the positions of many

baseplate proteins relative to each other. Using gold-labeled antibodies, it had been found that ° gp8 is situated at about a 130 A radius in the baseplate and might interact with gp7 and gp10.21 ° We report here a 2.0 A resolution crystal ° structure of gp8 and show how it fits into a 12 A resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) three-dimensional reconstruction of the baseplatetail tube assembly. gp8 was found to form extensive contacts with other proteins, thus serving as an essential component of the baseplate.

Results
The gp8 structure The gp8 monomer (Mr 38,008) consists of 334 amino acid residues, out of which 13 are methionine, three are histidine, and five are cysteine.22 The native protein and its Se-methionine (SeMet) derivative have been purified to homogeneity and crystallized in two non-isomorphous crystal forms (Table 1). The structure of crystal form II was

layer b-sandwich with two finger-like loops containing an a-helix at the opposite sides of the sandwich (Figure 1). The two peripheral, five-stranded, antiparallel b-sheets are stacked against the middle, four-stranded, antiparallel b-sheet. The monomer structure can be divided into two domains: residues 1 ­87 and 246 ­334 forming domain I, and residues 88­ 245 forming domain II. A search for folds homologous to gp8 using the program DALI26 showed no significant similarity to any other structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). A BLAST search in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database27 showed that only the gp8-like protein from the T4-type phage RB4928 had any significant sequence similarity. The amino acid sequence for gp8 of RB49 is incomplete,29 but the 45 residues available have 60% identity with the C-terminal residues 241 ­286 of gp8 from T4. The amino acid sequence identities of other T4 and RB49 baseplate proteins range from 44% to 75%, suggesting that gp8 is one of the better conserved proteins in both phages. gp8 was found to be a dimer in both crystal forms (Table 1; Figure 2), consistent with previous cross-linking and ultracentrifugation data.20,30 An ° ° area of 2638 A2 of the total 17,508 A2 accessible area of the monomer is buried upon dimer for° mation, assuming a 1.4 A radius probe (Figure 3). Both crystal forms have two dimers in their P1 unit cells (Table 1), related by a nearly-perfect 2-fold screw axis perpendicular to each dimer's 2-fold axis, thus generating a third 2-fold axis orthogonal to the first two non-crystallographic axes. As a result, the k ¼ 1808 rotation functions in both the crystal forms have three peaks 908 apart from each other (Figure 4). A pair-wise, least-squares superposition of the six dimers in the three independently refined crys° tal structures showed an r.m.s. deviation of 1.3 A a or less between the equivalenced C atoms, implying that there was little difference in the overall molecular conformations even in the presence of different lattice forces. The largest deviations occurred in the external loops formed by residues 28­ 35 and 139­ 163. The residues of the first loop

in one of the monomers in crystal form II have a different conformation from that in all other monomers in any of the dimers. The second loop moves as a rigid body with the most external ° equivalenced Ca atoms deviating by up to 5 A in different monomers upon superposition. This loop is part of one of the two fingers of the monomer. It contains a short a-helix (residues 149 ­155) crosslinked by an S ­ S bond between Cys153 and Cys142. Although the r.m.s. deviation between the Ca atoms on superimposing equivalent residues of ° monomers within a dimer is only 0.9 A, the dis° placement of the side-chains is as great as 10 A in some cases.

Bromide-binding sites As an initial structure determination attempt, X-ray diffraction data had been collected from the crystals grown in a solution containing 1 M LiBr (Table 1). However, it was difficult to find the bromide sites ab initio in the LiBr-grown crystals by analysis of a Bijvoet difference Patterson.31 Neither manual interpretation nor the SHELX computer program32 were able to identify even the major Br sites. Nevertheless, a Bijvoet difference Fourier map, using phases from the molecular replacement solution, showed that there were up to 11 ordered bromine atoms per monomer, a total

The temperature factor of each bromine atom was assumed to be equal to the average of the refined temperature factors for all residues that constitute the binding site. Intradimer halide sites are identified in column 2 by unsuperscripted residues in the reference molecule and by an `A' superscripted residue in the dimer-related molecule. Interdimer halide sites are identified by unsuperscripted residues in the reference molecule and by a `B' superscripted residue in the crystallographically related monomer.

of 40 in the unit cell (Table 2). The Br peaks had heights ranging from 5s to 13s with the highest noise peaks being about 5s. Seven sites, 1 and 4 through 9 (Table 2), are present in all four monomers comprising the unit cell (identified by A, B, C, and D) and are related by non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS). There are four Br-binding sites, 2, 3, 4, and 6, at the interface between the monomers, whereas the others are on the surface of a single monomer. Site 2 is on the interface between monomer A belonging to dimer 1 (or monomer C belonging to dimer 2) and its crystal lattice-related counterpart monomer B0 belonging to dimer 10 (or monomer D0 belonging to dimer 20 ) (Figure 5). The crystal packing in both crystal forms creates similar interdimer contacts along their a-axis crystal translations. The two neighboring dimers in these two crystal forms interact via residues forming Br site 2 (Pro118, Tyr119, and Arg92) (Figure 5). The dimer pair of one crystal form can be super-

imposed onto the dimer pair in the other crystal with an r.m.s. deviation between the equivalenced ° Ca atoms of 1.5 A (Figure 5). Thus, the Br interdimer site 2 might be crucial for crystal formation. In the other two monomers (B and D), this site is occluded by the crystal packing arrangement (Table 2). Analysis of the Br sites showed that sites 1, 4, 5, 8, and 11 are situated at the N termini of a-helices. Peptide bonds of the protein backbone are aligned along the helix axis, thus creating a dipole with positive and negative charges at the helical N and C termini, respectively. Presumably, the positive charge on the N termini, the possibility of forming hydrogen bonds between the Br and the mainchain nitrogen atoms, and the hydrophobicity of the environment all contribute in the formation of these Br-binding sites. To further establish the character of such a halide-binding site, all Brcontaining, and some I and Cl-containing crystal

structures available in the PDB (as of March 2002) were checked manually for the presence of an a-helix N terminus close to the halide. The backbone atoms of the halide-associated helices were then superimposed onto each other. It was found ° that the halide sites form a cluster with a 1.0 A standard deviation from their mean position (Figure 6). In seven out of the 16 helices analyzed, the binding site contained a Pro residue in position 1 or 2, and in 11 cases there was a Ser or Thr residue in position 2 or 3. In 14 helices there was at least one hydrophobic amino acid residue participating in halide binding. The temperature factors of the Br sites in gp8 crystal form I refined to values ranging from ° ° 60 A2 to 126 A2 when the occupancies were assumed to be full, suggesting that these atoms ° contribute little to the overall diffraction in the 6 A ° resolution range. Similarly, on refinement of to 3 A the Br sites occupancies, assuming that their temperature factors are equal to the average temperature factor of the binding site residues, it was found that the Br sites are substituted quite poorly (Table 2). As a consequence, the 40 £ 39 difference Br ­ Br vectors in the Bijvoet difference Patterson map would have been diluted by noise peaks as the average Br ­ Br peak in this map was 2.4s, whereas the highest noise peaks were about 2.9s. This contrasts with the results reported by Dauter et al.,33 who were able to determine the position and use for phasing at least nine well ordered Br sites in the presence of a 40 kDa protein. In that ° case, however, the data extended to 1.8 A instead ° resolution, and the mean I=sðIÞ value of only 2.9 A was 23.4 instead of 16.2. Nevertheless, the Br sites in the gp8 structure could be identified in Bijvoet difference Fouriers once the phases had been established reasonably. Further examination of the PDB showed that a water molecule is found frequently at the N termini of a-helices at sites equivalent to the halide-binding sites identified here. Therefore, in general, it should be possible to prepare a halide derivative for many proteins. However, such a derivative would be useful for phasing only if scattering from the halide atoms contributes to the high-resolution diffraction. Fitting of the crystal structures into the cryoEM map of the baseplate ° A three-dimensional, 12 A resolution cryoEM map of the 6-fold-symmetric baseplate-tail tube assembly has been determined (V.A.K. et al., unpublished results).5 A search was made for the best match of the gp8 dimer X-ray structure with the cryoEM density using the programs COLORES from the SITUS suite34 and EMfit.35 Only Ca atoms of the gp8 dimer were used in these searches. Both programs placed the gp8 dimer in the upper outer rim (Figure 7) of the baseplate, in agreement with previously published immunogold-labeling electron microscopy studies.21 The center of

gravity of the fitted gp8 dimer is at a radius of ° 139 A relative to the baseplate 6-fold axis, which is ° consistent with the radius of about 130 A observed in the immunogold-labeling studies.21 The distance between the centers of gravity of the EMfit- and ° COLORES-fitted dimers is 0.6 A, and the rotation between the fitted molecules is about 48 (Table 3). The best COLORES fit corresponds to the scoring criterion peak with a height of 14.7s, whereas the highest noise peak had a height of only 7.3s (Figure 8) (see Materials and Methods). In contrast, when using the inverted map, the highest peak had a value of 7.8s compared with the highest noise peak of 7.7s. Thus, the hand of the cryoEM map and the position of gp8 in the baseplate were identified uniquely. Furthermore, the hand of the reconstruction was further confirmed by fitting two other crystal structures of the baseplate proteins (gp11 and gp12) into the cryoEM map (V.A.K. et al., unpublished results).

Discussion
gp8, like the other baseplate proteins with known crystal structures, gp93, gp117, gp5 and

gp275, and gp128, has a unique architecture. However, in contrast to all the other known baseplate protein structures, which are trimers, gp8 is a dimer both in the crystals and in the assembled

baseplate. The current analysis of the interactions between gp8 and the rest of the baseplate is limited by the resolution of the cryoEM three-dimensional reconstruction and by the absence of atomic structures of proteins interacting with gp8. However, it is possible to identify some of the gp8-baseplate contacts based on the low resolution model published earlier.20,21 It is known that attachment of gp8 to the baseplate during assembly creates a binding site for subsequent attachment of gp614 and that gp8 is essential for solubility of the recombinant gp6.30 Therefore, gp8 and gp6 interact in vivo and in vitro and, presumably, they interact in the baseplate. It has been proposed that gp6 girdles the baseplate at a radius smaller than that of gp8.20 Hence, the density contacting gp8 on its surface closest to the center of the baseplate is likely to be that of gp6 (Figure 9; Table 4). gp8 was found to interact with gp7 and gp10 in vitro and in vivo.10,14 It was further established that gp10 and gp7 lie at a radius larger than that of gp8.21 Therefore, the contact areas of gp8 furthest away from the center of the baseplate are likely to be the gp8 ­gp7 and gp8 ­gp10 interactions. Overall, about 21% of the gp8 surface (an ° ° area of , 6000 A2 of the total , 29,700 A2) is involved in contacts with other baseplate proteins. Most of the observed contacts do not obey the 2-fold symmetry of the gp8 dimer (Table 4), which might be explained by the flexibility of the amino acid side-chains that form the protein surface. ° These residues can deviate by up to 10 A when the monomers forming a dimer are superimposed onto each other. Although wedges are assembly intermediates in the building of baseplates, the wedge boundaries are not apparent in the cryoEM reconstruction. Presumably, the stable gp8 dimer would be a pre-wedge assembly unit, thus showing that the wedge boundary would not be between the two gp8 monomers within a dimer. Similarly, the wedge boundary is unlikely to be between subunits of the trimeric protein units. With further structural data on other baseplate proteins, as well as a cryoEM structure of the starshaped baseplate with the contractile tail, it is to be expected that a fuller understanding will evolve regarding the efficient infection mechanism of bacteriophage T4 (V.A.K. et al., unpublished results).

threitol (DTT) to all buffers used to purify gp8 SeMet in order to obtain good-quality crystals. For crystallization, the protein was brought to a concentration of 20 mg ml21 in 10 mM Tris ­ HCl at pH 7.5 plus 1 mM DTT when growing SeMet gp8 crystals. The drops, containing 2 ml of the protein solution and 2 ml of the well solution, were equilibrated against 777 ml of the well solution (Table 1). The crystals usually appeared in two days and continued growing for several weeks. The exceptionally fragile crystals, measuring up to 1 mm £ 1 mm £ 0.2 mm in size, were grown in hanging drops. Two crystal forms were observed both belonging to space group P1 (Table 1). The Matthews coefficient37 ° was 2.36 A3 Da1 when it was assumed that there were four monomers per unit cell. This estimate was confirmed later by a rotation function calculation38 and by the successful structure determination. Data collection and processing Although the gp8 crystals were quite large, they grew in clusters and could not be mounted undamaged due to their fragility. Most of the damage occurred during the transfer of the crystals into the cryoprotectant solution containing the well solution and 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The crystals were soaked for about five minutes in the cryoprotectant solution and then flashfrozen at 100 K in a vaporized nitrogen stream. The crystals of SeMet gp8 were smaller and even more fragile than those of the native protein. Fortunately, the mother liquor of the SeMet gp8 served as a cryoprotectant, allowing the most harmful step of crystal handling to be omitted. Usually, about 50 crystals needed to be tested before one suitable for data collection could be found. Data from the native and LiBr-grown crystals and from the SeMet crystal were collected at the beamlines 14 BMC and 14 BMD, respectively (Advanced Photon Source (APS), Sector 14, BioCARS) (Table 1). The native and LiBr data sets each consisted of 360 frames taken with a 18 oscillation angle. During the LiBr data collection, the X-ray energy was set to 13.776 keV, which is 302 eV greater than the theoretical Br K-edge, making it possible to detect a Br anomalous scattering signal. Data-merging statistics indicated that the anomalous scattering signal was below the noise level for data ° whose interplanar spacing was less than 6 A, indicating why subsequent searches for Br sites in Bijvoet difference Pattersons had failed. A three-wavelength MAD data set was collected using a SeMet gp8 crystal. Due to a monochromator problem, this data set did not include the wavelength where f 0 is at a minimum, although the wavelength at which f 00 is at a maximum was recollected twice. Each wavelength contained 360 frames taken with a 18 oscillation angle. Structure solution and refinement The anomalous signal for the maximum f 00 wavelength ° of the SeMet data set was significant to about 3.0 A resolution. The Se sites were located with the help of the program SHELX39 in a Bijvoet difference Patterson map ° ° calculated using a 20 A to 3.5 A resolution range data set collected at the wavelength where f 00 is at a maximum. Each monomer contained 13 methionine residues, giving a total of 52 methionine residues in the unit cell (Table 1). Therefore, only those SHELX solutions were considered that contained about 50 sites. Later, it was established that all SHELX solutions contained the

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification, and crystallization gp8 was purified as described by Shneider et al.,30 except that EDTA was omitted from the buffers. The SeMet derivative of gp8 was produced by using the B834 (DE3) strain of E. coli, which is a methionine-requiring auxotroph, as described by Ramakrishnan et al.36 and Leiman et al.7 Instead of (L )-SeMet, a cheaper racemate of (L )- and (D )-SeMet was used at twice the normally recommended concentration. The SeMet gp8 was purified using the modified form of the protocol described by Shneider et al.30 It was essential to add fresh dithio-

correct sites along with a few weak incorrect sites. The first 52 sites of the best SHELX solution, plus the diffrac° ° tion data from all three wavelengths in the 40 A to 2.2 A resolution range, were input into the program SOLVE40 using the "ADDSOLVE" flag, which allows for thorough testing of each input site, removal of inconsistent sites, and automatic addition of new sites. SOLVE found 39 sites that produced the best phasing statistics and generated an interpretable map (Table 1). The program RESOLVE41 then found the 2-fold screw axis relating the two gp8 dimers in the unit cell (Figure 4). This NCS axis was consistent with the self-rotation function (Figure 4). Subsequently, RESOLVE was used for cycles of NCS density averaging and solvent flattening. The excellent quality of the map allowed the program RESOLVE to trace automatically 92% of the main chain in all four gp8 monomers. An atomic model of the SeMet gp8 consisting of residues 7 ­ 334 was built with the help of program XtalView42 and refined with the program CNS.43 The free R-factor was calculated using 2.5% of reflections that had been selected by the program FREEFLAG44,45 and were excluded from the refinement. The final atomic model of gp8 refined against the SeMet data set contained 1025 water molecules and 30 Cl ions in the unit cell. The working and free R-factors were 21% and 24%, respectively. The model has a good geometry with 89% of the residues being in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot and none in the disallowed region, as judged by the program PROCHECK.44,46 The structure of crystal form I was determined by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe,47 with the crystal form II gp8 dimer as a search model. The anomalous scattering signal of the LiBr data and the phases from a partially refined atomic model were used to calculate a Bijvoet difference Fourier map. All peaks greater than noise level (,5.0s) and possessing NCS were selected. The B-factors of these sites were set to the average B-factors of the binding site residues, permitting refinement of their occupancies with the CNS ° program using the LiBr data in the 50.0­ 2.9 A resolution range (Table 2). It was assumed that these sites bind Cl or Br (as appropriate) in all of the structures, since anionbinding sites often remain unchanged in different crystal forms independent of the nature of the anion.48 Bromine sites 4, 6 10, 12, 13, and 14 in crystal form I had no Cl counterparts in crystal form II, as judged by the height of the corresponding electron density peaks in a difference Fourier map. Electron microscopy Mutant phage T4 lacking the ability to produce major capsid and sheath proteins was used to create the baseplate-tail tube complex. The sample was vitrified on holey carbon films using standard cryoEM techniques49. A Philips CM300 FEG transmission electron microscope (FEI, Inc., Eindhoven, The Netherlands) was used to record images on Kodak SO-163 film (Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY, USA) under low dose ° (21­ 25 e2/A2) at a nominal magnification of 47,000£. Micrographs were scanned on a Zeiss SCAI microdensitometer. The scanning resolution was 7 mm/pixel, with subsequent 2 £ 2 pixels averaging to give 14 mm/pixel, ° with a resulting resolution of 2.98 A/pixel. The cryoEM map of the baseplate-tail tube assembly was obtained using the back-projection technique with the program SPIDER50 and software designed to process

non-cubic cell reconstructions (V.A.K. et al., unpublished results). From 30 micrographs, five were selected, in ° which the Thon rings extended to at least 10 A resolution. Of the , 2000 boxed particles, a total of 1037 projected images were accepted for the cryoEM reconstruction. The baseplate was assumed to be 6-fold symmetric. The resolution of the resultant map was estimated in a standard manner by splitting the data ° into two independent sets and was found to be 12 A. Fitting of the crystal structure into the baseplate cryoEM map The Ca trace of the gp8 dimer structure was used as a search model for fitting into the baseplate cryoEM map. Although a manual interpretation of the map identified the position of gp8 quite unambiguously, a systematic six-dimensional (three translational plus three rotational parameters) search for the best fit was performed using the program COLORES from the SITUS program package (version 2.0).34 The search was reduced to a quarter of the baseplate, which represents one and one-half of the asymmetric unit of the baseplate (Figure 8). This volume is big enough to observe the consistency in the 6-fold-related sites. The scoring criterion in the COLORES program can be interpreted as matching of the surface features between the fitted structure and the cryoEM density. As an alternative to "surface matching", the program EMfit (version 15)35 with different, real-space based, scoring criteria was used. An initial approximate position, but not orientation, was provided to the EMfit program. The best fits in both programs were almost identical (Table 3) and in good agreement with the position that had been determined manually. Molecular graphics images Figures 1 and 2 were drawn using MOLSCRIPT51 and Raster3D.52 Figures 5, 8 and 9 were drawn using the program DINO Figure 6 was drawn using XtalView42 and Raster3D.52 Protein Data Base accession numbers The refined atomic model of gp8 has been deposited in the PDB with the accession numbers 1N80 (crystal form I), 1N8B (crystal form I, LiBr-grown crystals), and 1N7Z (crystal form II).
