Introduction. The classic catabolic pathway by which fatty acids are degraded is -oxidation, and a mitochondrial as well as a peroxisomal -oxidation pathway is known. Very long-chain fatty acids, 2-methyl-branched fatty acids, the side-chains of bile acid intermediates, and eicosanoids are mainly handled by the peroxisomal pathway, whereas short- and medium-chain fatty acids are oxidized mainly in mitochondria.1,2 Phytanic acid and other 3-methyl-branched fatty acids cannot undergo -oxidation, because the 3-methyl group prevents the formation of a 3-keto substituent in the dehydrogenation step. Therefore, 3-methyl-branched fatty acids first undergo -oxidation.3 In the case of phytanic acid, this results in the generation of 2-methyl-branched pristanic acid (2,6,10,14tetramethyl pentadecanoic acid), which is then shortened to 4,8-dimethyl nonanoic acid via peroxisomal -oxidation. The dimethyl fatty acid is then degraded further via mitochondrial -oxidation.4 The -oxidation of fatty acids is not a stereoselective process,5,6 so that after -oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids, both (R,R,R)- and (S,R,R)isomers are formed. However, the -oxidation system is stereoselective because only the (2S)-isomer is accepted as substrate by branched-chain acyl­ coenzyme A (CoA) oxidase, the first enzyme of the -oxidation system. Thus, the (R,R,R)-isomers of the metabolites of -oxidation need to be converted to their (S,R,R)-isomers by enzymatic racemization prior to further degradation.6,7 The fatty acid-CoA racemase (FAR) encoded by the far gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv converts several (2R)-branched-chain fatty acid-CoA's to their (2S)stereoisomers in the metabolism of fatty acids. FAR is thought to be involved in this racemization prior to the stereospecific -oxidation, although this has not yet been demonstrated experimentally. Bhaumik et al.8 found three genes--mcr, far, and Rv3727--in the M. tuberculosis genome that encode proteins that are homologous to mammalian -methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR), which is a mitochondrial and peroxisomal enzyme that is essential in the -oxidation of bile acid intermediates and branchedchain fatty acids.7,9 Among them, only one crystal structure of -methylacyl-CoA racemase (MCR) from M. tuberculosis relative to mammalian AMACR has been reported to date.10 Thus, the FAR from M. tuberculosis was taken as

fer reactions. However, CoA transferase activity has not been detected in the enzyme assays used so far.7,12,13 Therefore, a possible new role is suggested for AMACR as a functional enzyme that racemizes its substrates.11 In this work, we determined the crystal structure of FAR from M. tuberculosis H37Rv, revealing an interlocked dimer with an unusual protein fold. Our results indicate that the FAR has amino acid sequences that represent CoA transferase family III, and is structurally similar to this family of proteins. Materials and Methods.

Reflection data chosen randomly from 5% of the observed data were used for cross-validation with the Rfree value. We initially refined the rigid body model with the program CNS, then performed model refinement using COOT.17 Water molecules were automatically picked up by the CNS package, and they were then confirmed based on peak height and distance criteria in the Fo­Fc and 2Fo­Fc maps. We analyzed the quality of the final and intermediate models using PROCHECK.18 The coordinates have been deposited in the PDB with the accession number 2G04.

Structural comparison. We carried out structure analysis using the following computer programs: Swiss-PdbViewer19 and COOT17 for superposition of molecules and secondary structure-based alignment; SSAP Server20 for calculation of root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs); ESPript21 for preparation of the secondary structure alignment figure; PyMol22 for the depiction of structure; and GRASP23 for calculation and depiction of electrostatic potential at the molecular surface. Other orthologs used in the structural comparison were M. tuberculosis MCR (PDB code: 1X74),13 Escherichia coli YfdW (PDB code: 1PT7),24 and Oxalobacter formigenes FRC (PDB code: 1P5H).25

Results and Discussion. Crystallographic data and refinement statistics. The crystals of FAR were found to belong to the trigonal space group P32, with unit cell parameters a b 109.56 Å and c 147.97 Å. Six monomers were contained per asymmetric unit (VM 2.15 Å3Da 1, ca. 42.8% solvent).14 The crystal structure of FAR was determined at 2.7 Å resolution by molecular replacement. After the phases were improved, the resulting electron density map was readily interpretable and allowed model building. Several rounds of model adjustment, simulated annealing, positional refinement, noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints refinement, and individual thermal factor refinement were performed. The refined model of FAR gave Rfactor and Rfree values26 of 24.2 and 29.0%, respectively. The final apo-protein model consists of 2118 residues (353 residues/monomer of the 359 in sequence), except for residues 1­3 and 66 ­ 68 in the main-chain of each subunit. In the Ramachandran plot,27 analysis of the final model with PROCHECK reveals that 83.5%, 14.6%, 1.9%, and 0.0% of residues were in the most favored, additional allowed, generously allowed, and disallowed regions, respectively. The data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.

Overall structure and dimer configuration. The overall structure of the FAR monomer consists essentially of two domains, the large domain and the small domain, and two linker regions ( 7­ 8 and 12­13, 10 ­11) that connect the two domains. The large domain comprises both N-terminal ( 1­ 4, 6, 1­ 6) and C-terminal parts of the protein chain (residues 335­359), while the small domain contains 9 ­ 11, 4, and 7-9 [Fig. 1(A)]. The core of the large domain has an open sheet structure with a Rossmann-like fold consisting of a central, six-stranded, parallel -sheet ( 1­ 6) with helices packed to both sides. The loop after 2 is disordered. The connection between strains 5 and 6 is left-handed and is connected by three helices ( 5, 3, and 6): After 5, the polypeptide chain, including two helices ( 5 and 3), makes a protrusion toward the small domain. A long loop leads back to the large domain where 6 and 6 complete the / structure. The first linker 7­ 8, a long, very bent helix, connects the large domain with the small domain. The core of the small domain is a three-stranded, antiparallel -sheet that starts and ends with strands 7 and 9, respectively. The first two strands ( 7 and 8) are joined by a short loop, while four helices ( 9 ­11 and 4) are inserted between the second and the third strand.

After strand 9, the second linker ( 12­13, 10 ­11) connects the small domain back to the large domain, such that a large hole is created by the folded polypeptide chain of one subunit [Fig. 1(B)]. An unexpected feature of the subunit is the hole formed between the domains. The connecting, kinked helix 7­ 8 of the second subunit, as well as the protruding helices 5 and 3 of the second subunit, passes through this hole, making a very tight, interlocked dimer, in which the two subunits are related by a local twofold axis. The twofold related subunits in the dimer embrace each other with their C-terminal parts, giving rise to an interlocked dimer. The linker helix 7­ 8 of the first monomer passes through the hole present in the second monomer and vice versa.

This puts two domains of one subunit on top of and below the hole of the other subunit. The hole is filled further by the stretch 5 and 3, but this does not give rise to a knot, because this is only a protrusion from the large domain. The FAR dimer is formed by two elongated rings that interpenetrate as the first two rings of a chain. The dimeric assembly of two subunits results in an interlocked mode of interaction between the two polypeptide chains, because the C-terminal tail of one subunit folds back on its own N-terminal large domain, after a long excursion in which the small domain is formed [Fig. 1(C)]. Consequently, the crystal structure of FAR exists as a tightly interlocked dimer, and the crystal packing contains three dimers in a crystallographic asymmetry unit. The accessible surface areas (ASAs) of the monomer and the dimer were 18637.2 Å2 and 24592.5 Å2, respectively. Dimer formation decreases the ASA by 6340.9 Å2 per monomer, which amounts to 34.0% of the total surface of the monomer. Among the buried surface residues, 62.0% are nonpolar, 24.1% are polar, and 13.9% are charged, indicating that the majority of the dimeric interface is formed by hydrophobic interactions. A long -helix ( 6) from each monomer is located at the dimeric interface contributing hydrophobic interactions from the following residues; Val156, Ala157, Leu165, Val166, Leu167, Leu168, Ile170, Val171, Val172, Ala173, Leu174. From the structural aspects, dimerization appears to be important for the racemase function and stability of M. tuberculosis H37Rv FAR. Most of the dimeric interface is nonpolar, so the formation of a dimer would be energetically favorable compared to the monomer in solution. The two clefts. Dimeric FAR presents two surface clefts, located in the interface between the large domain of one subunit and the small domain of the other subunit [Fig. 1(C)]. Some conserved residues--Arg93, His128, Asp158, and Glu243--are all located in the two clefts [Fig. 2(B)]. The arrangement of residues in the cleft of FAR is quite similar to that of M. tuberculosis MCR13 and other family III CoA transferase members, suggesting that the clefts of FAR would be suitable for substrate binding and catalytic reaction, as observed in the structure of the FRC­CoA complex.25,28 Functional and structural similarities to other proteins. The multiple alignment of amino acid sequence identities between FAR and FRC or YfdW, as the known structure of the family III CoA transferases, were 29.8% and 32.7%, respectively [Fig 2(A)]. The pairwise structure comparison using the SSAP Server20 revealed that the FAR possesses the structural resemblance to family III of CoA transferases. In the superposition of three crystallographically independent dimeric structures with FAR, FRC (PDB ID: 1P5H), and YfdW (PDB ID: 1PT7), the RMSDs for the C atoms were 2.96 and 2.87 Å, respectively. For the superposition of the FAR-dimer on the FRC-dimer and YfdWdimer as shown in Figure 2(C), the investigation of structural similarities found that the six -strands of the large domain and the three -strands of the small domain, as well as the -helices 1­ 4, and 6 of the large domain, of both subunits were used. Inspection of Figure 2(C) shows

that the quaternary structure of the interlocked dimer is very well preserved between FAR and FRC or YfdW. Despite the low sequence identity between FAR and FRC or YfdW, both of these CoA transferases are folded as interlocked dimers. It is very likely that most other members of the family III of CoA transferases have this intriguing fold. It is unlikely that monomeric proteins of this fold exist. In addition, the surface electrostatic potential of dimeric FAR is negative and is similar to those of dimeric FRC and YfdW as the known structures of the family III CoA transferases [Fig. 3]. These results indicated that the FAR from M. tuberculosis H37Rv belongs to member of the recently identified family III of CoA transferases. It is shown that the FAR has unique structural features which not seen in the identities of the sequence related FRC or YfdW. Although additional experimental evidence must be obtained, we suggest that the family III CoA transferases might be subdivided in at least two classes, being racemases and CoA transferases.
