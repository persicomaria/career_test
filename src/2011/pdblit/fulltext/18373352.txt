We have used high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to determine the solution structure of DNA containing the genotoxic lesion 1,N2-etheno-2-deoxyguanosine (G), paired to dC. The NMR data suggest the presence of a major, minimally perturbed structure at neutral pH. NOESY spectra indicate the presence of a right-handed helix with all nucleotides in anti, 2-deoxyribose conformations within the C2-endo/C1-exo range and proper Watson­Crick base pair alignments outside the lesion site. The G residue remains deeply embedded inside the helix and stacks between the flanking base pairs. The lesion partner dC is extrahelical and is located in the minor groove of the duplex, where it is highly exposed to solvent. Upon acidification of the sample, a second conformation at the lesion site of the duplex emerges, with protonation of the lesion partner dC and possible formation of a Hoogsteen base pair. Restrained molecular dynamics simulations of the neutral-pH structure generated a set of three-dimensional models that show G inside the helix, where the lesion is stabilized by stacking interactions with flanking bases but without participating in hydrogen bonding. The lesion counterbase dC is displaced in the minor groove of the duplex where it can form a hydrogen bond with the sugar O4 atom of a residue 2 bp away.

ABSTRACT:

The industrial use of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), the building block in the production of the polymer plastics, continues to grow. Vinyl chloride is a well-established environmental hazard whose exposure is associated with a rare form of human cancer, angiosarcoma of the liver (1). It generates various types of DNA lesions that produce base pair substitutions as well as other genotoxic actions, including sister chromatid exchange, gene conversion events, and chromosomal aberrations (2). The metabolic oxidation of vinyl chloride by CYP2E1 generates 2-chloroacetaldehyde and 2-chloroethylene oxide, compounds that may react with DNA to form etheno lesions, such as 3,N4-ethenocytosine (dC), 1,N6-ethenoadenine (dA), N2,3-ethenoguanine (N2,3dG), and 1,N2-ethenoguanine (1,N2-dG) (3­6). The same adducts also arise from the reaction of endogenous lipid peroxidation products with nucleobases (7, 8), suggesting that etheno bases could be a generic risk factor in sporadic carcinogenesis. The number of etheno adducts formed in rodent tissues after exposure to vinyl chloride varies significantly, and 1,N2-dG has still to be detected in vivo (9). In contrast, treatment of calf thymus DNA with ethyl linoleate or 4-hydroxynonenal generates significant levels of 1,N2-dG, levels even higher than those of N2,3-dG, indicating that the former lesion would play a predominant

role in carcinogenesis derived from endogenous oxidative processes (10). All etheno adducts are genotoxic, causing mostly base substitution mutations. 1,N2-dG leads to G f T, G f C, and G f A substitutions in bacteria, while it triggers G f A and G f T mutations in mammalian cells (11, 12). In addition, it can generate double mutants, as well as one- and two-base deletions and rearrangements near the lesion site (12). Repair activities present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells remove etheno bases from DNA, primarily by base excision repair (BER). In Escherichia coli, the mismatchspecific uracil glycosylase (MUG) incises DNA containing dC or 1,N2-dG lesions and AlkA operates on N2,3-dG and dA (13­15). Mammalian alkyl-N-purine-DNA glycosylase (ANPG) can remove dA and 1,N2-dG lesions, and mismatch-specific thymine-DNA glycosylase (hTDG) deals with dC adducts (13, 16­18). The structural determinants that mediate the recognition of a given etheno lesion by a specific DNA glycosylase remain poorly understood. The solution structures of duplexes containing a single dA or dC adduct paired to their respective Watson­Crick partners, or in the context of different mutagenic intermediates, show that the lesions induce only a local and relatively minor perturbation of the B-form conformation, without disrupting the Watson­Crick alignment on lesion-flanking base pairs. In all these duplexes, the etheno residue remains inside the helix where it is stabilized by hydrogen bond formation and stacking interactions with lesion-flanking base pairs (19­24). Recently, Shanmugam and co-workers reported the conformation of duplex DNA containing the 1,N2dG lesion (25, 44). At pH 5.2, dG adopts a syn conformation forming a Hoogsteen base pair with its protonated

Proper strand stoichiometry was obtained by following the intensity of NMR proton signals during gradual addition of the unmodified strand to the dG-containing strand, at 55 °C. The typical NMR sample consisted of approximately 300 OD260 units of duplex dissolved in 0.6 mL of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) containing 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA, for a final duplex concentration of approximately 4.2 mM. The sample pH was measured and adjusted to the desired value before exchange with D2O. The duplex sample was lyophilized and dissolved in 99.96% D2O (D2O buffer) before NMR data collection. In addition, the sample was lyophilized and dissolved in a 90% H2O/10% D2O mixture (H2O buffer) for collection of the exchangeable proton spectra. The pH dependence study started with the sample dissolved at neutral pH followed by smooth acidification caused by the addition of microliter amounts of a 0.5 M HCl solution. Reported pH values are meter readings at room temperatures. NMR Experiments. One- and two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded using Varian (Inova) spectrometers operating at a field strengths of 11.75 or 14.1 T. Proton chemical shifts were referenced relative to sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 at 0 ppm. Phase-sensitive (28) NOESY (50, 150, 200, and 300 ms mixing times), TOCSY (70 and 120 ms mixing times), COSY, and DQFCOSY spectra in D2O buffer were recorded at 27 °C. The residual water signal was suppressed by presaturation during the repetition delay of 1.5 s. Phase-sensitive proton NOESY spectra (120 and 220 ms mixing times) in H2O buffer were recorded at 5 °C, using a "jump and return" reading pulse (29). NMR data were processed and analyzed using Felix (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) running on Silicon Graphics workstations. Data sets consisted of 2048 and 300 complex data points in the t2 and t1 dimensions, respectively. Prior to Fourier transformation, shifted sine-bell window functions were used to smooth the time domain data and prevent discontinuation artifacts at the last point. No baseline correction was applied to the frequency domain data. Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were calculated at 800 MHz using a combination of gradient-enhanced 1H-13C HSQC and gradient-selected TROSY experiments (30). The liquid crystal phase consisted of 5% of a pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether/n-hexanol mixture. Refinement of the Duplex Structure. Restrained MD simulations were performed using X-PLOR 3.1 (31) running on Silicon Graphics computers. Simulations were run in Vacuo using an all-atom force field derived from CHARMM (32) with the dielectric constant set to 4 (33). Partial charges on the etheno bridge atoms were derived by analogy with our previous studies with dC and dA (19, 21, 22), resulting in a neutral dG base. Partial atomic charges on phosphate groups were not reduced, resulting in deoxynucleotide residues with a net charge of -1. Interproton distances were calculated by subjecting a canonical B-form duplex structure to 1000 steps of potential energy minimization, using a sole penalty function proportional to the difference between back-calculated and experimental NOE intensities (34). Interproton distances were extracted from the atom coordinates of the energy-minimized model. NOE cross-peak intensities were measured from all NOESY (50, 150, 200,

dC+ partner. At basic pH, 1,N2-dG remains anti and stacks between flanking bases, while displacing its counterbase in the major groove of the duplex. At neutral pH, NMR1 signals are broad, presumably due to the exchange between the acidic and basic conformations, a fact that precluded determination of the duplex structure. We report here the solution structure of a d(C-G-T-A-CG-C-A-T-G-C) · d(G-C-A-T-G-C-G-T-A-C-G) oligodeoxynucleotide duplex (throughout this paper called the dG duplex), as determined by high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. At pH 6.9 and 27 °C, the dG duplex adopts a major conformation, which has common features and also some important differences with the structure determined by Shanmugam and co-workers at basic pH, with the lesion present in the d(...TG-G...) sequence. The chemical structure of the 1,N2-dG adduct and the sequence and numbering of the duplex used in our study are shown in Figure 1. MATERIALS AND METHODS Synthesis and Purification of 2-Deoxynucleotide Oligomers. The 11-mer oligonucleotide containing a single 1,N2ethenodeoxyguanosine lesion was prepared following a postsynthetic modification approach previously reported (26). Briefly, we prepared an N2-protected deoxyguanosine having a 2,3-diacetoxypropane chain at the N1 position. Following conversion of this nucleoside to the 5-O-DMT-3-O-phosphoramidite derivative, we employed standard solid-phase synthesis to synthesize the deoxynucleotide oligomer containing the modified dG at its center. After cleavage of synthesis products from the solid support by treatment of the resin with a concentrated ammonium solution, sodium periodate was used to oxidize the diol moiety, generating the dG-containing oligonucleotide. The unmodified oligodeoxynucleotide was synthesized using standard solidphase chemical methods. Damaged and undamaged oligodeoxynucleotides were purified by HPLC methods following protocols previously described (27). Oligomer composition was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy using a Micromass Quattro LC system. Oligodeoxynucleotides were desalted using a Sephadex G-25 column and

and 300 ms mixing times) spectra recorded in D2O buffer using Felix and used for distance calculations. A grid search showed that 1.56 ns was the best-fit isotropic correlation time for calculation of the full relaxation matrix, and this value was used for distance computations. Five hundred sixty-one experimental distances were enforced during the molecular dynamics calculations by using square-well potential energy functions with boundaries of (0.6 Å to the values computed from the NOESY spectra. Similarly, boundaries of (0.9 Å were used for interproton distances derived from cross-peaks only present in the 300 ms mixing time NOESY spectrum or from overlapping NOE peaks. Our molecular dynamics protocol consisted of a heating step, where the temperature of the system was increased from its initial value to 500 K in 20 ps, followed by a high-temperature step, during which time the temperature of the simulation remained constant at 500 K. After the high-temperature step, the system was cooled to 300 K over a period of 20 ps and equilibrated at this temperature for an additional 40 ps of molecular dynamics. Experimental distance restraints were softly introduced during the heating step of the simulations, using a penalty constant that gradually increased to its maximum value of 300 kcal mol-1 Å-2 and remained enforced until completion of the runs. Watson­Crick hydrogen bonds were enforced on all canonical base pairs of the duplex, including those flanking the dG · C base pair, using distance-dependent potential energy functions. Backbone dihedral angles were restrained by an empirical square-well potential function with a width encompassing the range of A- and B-form DNA conformations. Sugar puckers and glycosidic torsion angles were not restrained. Twenty structures were computed using five initial temperatures (140, 145, 150, 155, and 160 K) and four different high-temperature step lengths (35, 40, 45, and 55 ps). The last atomic coordinate frame of the simulations was energy-minimized, generating the ensemble of distance-refined structures. A set of seven refined models converged with a pairwise root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of atom position of <1.5 Å. They were averaged and energyminimized, producing the average three-dimensional model presented here. Refined models were analyzed using Chimera (35) and structural parameters obtained with Curves (36). RESULTS NMR Characterization of the dG Duplex. The onedimensional proton spectrum of the dG duplex recorded at 27 °C in D2O buffer (pH 6.9) (Figure 1S, Supporting Information) shows both relatively sharp and partially resolved proton signals, suggesting that the sample is amenable for complete structural studies. Assignment of the nonexchangeable proton signals resulted from the analysis of NOESY, COSY, and TOCSY spectra recorded at the same temperature following standard procedures (37, 38). Figure 2 shows the fingerprint region of a 500 MHz NOESY (300 ms mixing time) spectrum recorded with the dG duplex dissolved in D2O buffer (pH 6.9). Characteristic of a righthanded helix, each base proton (purine H8 or pyrimidine H6) of the duplex exhibits NOE interactions with the H1 sugar protons of the same and 5-flanking nucleotides. Similarly, each adenine H2 shows intrastrand NOE peaks with the H1 protons of the same and 3-flanking residues as well as interstrand cross-peaks with the H1 proton of

Each base proton (purine H8 or pyrimidine H6) exhibits NOE cross-peaks to its own and 5-flanking H1 sugar protons on the lesion-containing (solid lines) and unmodified (dashed lines) strands. Labels identify intraresidue base-H1 cross peaks and asterisks intraresidue cytosine H5-H6 interactions, and other labels are assigned as follows: (A) dA4 H2-dA4 H1 and dA4 H2-dA20 H1, (B) dA4 H2-T19 H1, (C) dA4 H2-dC5 H1, (D) dA8 H2-dA8 H1, (E) dA8 H2-T9 H1, (F) dA8 H2-dC17 H5, (G) dA14 H2-dA14 H1, (H) dA14 H2-dG10 H1, (I) dA14 H2-T9 H1, (J) dA14 H2-T15 H1, (K) dA20 H2-dA20 H1 and dA20 H2-dA4 H1, (L) dA20 H2-T3 H1 and dA20 H2-dC21 H1, (M) dG H8-dC5 H1, and (N) dG18 H8-dC17 H1.

its Watson­Crick partner and that of 3-flanking nucleotides (Figure 2, peaks A-E and G-M). The presence of the dG lesion causes only minor perturbations in this region of the NOESY spectrum. The intensity of the dC5 H1-dG H8 and dC17 H1-G18 H8 NOE peaks is rather weak (Figure 2, boxed peaks M and N), a fact that could reflect longer distances between these protons at the 5-side of the lesion or increased dynamics at the lesion site. A second unusual feature is the chemical shift value of dC17 H5, H6, and H1 proton signals, which are downfield from the values observed for other cytosines of the duplex (Table 1S, Supporting Information). In addition, the dC17 H5 proton signal displays NOE connectivity to the dA8 H2 proton (Figure 2, peak F), which is located in the minor groove of the duplex. This latter observation suggests that dC17 is extruded into the minor groove of the duplex and oriented toward the 3-end of the lesion-containing strand. In agreement with the C17 nonstacked position is the observation that the RDC of the C6-H6 interaction is 20 Hz, a value that is quite different from those measured for all other bases of the dG duplex (Table 2S,Supporting Information). The extrahelical location of C17 would increase solvent exposure of this residue, explaining the downfield shift of its H5, H6, and H1 proton signals. Assignment of the dG H10 and dG H11 protons followed the analysis of TOCSY spectra recorded in D2O buffer (pH 6.9) at 27 °C. As shown in Figure 2S (Supporting Information), there is only one TOCSY cross-peak between

protons resonating at 6.46 and 6.12 ppm, in the symmetrical H1 sugar proton region. In addition, there are no cross-peaks in the aromatic region of the TOCSY spectrum, indicating that the etheno protons are outside of this region. The signals at 6.46 and 6.12 ppm are somewhat broad, generating a relatively weak but evident NOE cross-peak (Figure 2S, Supporting Information), but they lack additional interactions with other protons of the dG duplex. Table 1S (Supporting Information) lists chemical shift values of the nonexchangeable protons of the dG duplex at 27 °C and pH 6.9. Nine partially resolved signals resonate in the 11.90­13.70 ppm region of a one-dimensional spectrum recorded in H2O buffer (pH 6.9) at 5 °C (Figure 3, top), accounting for all the imino protons of the dG duplex, with those belonging to the terminal base pairs overlapping at 12.97 ppm. Assignment of the exchangeable protons follows the analysis of the NOESY (120 ms mixing time) spectrum recorded in H2O buffer, at 5 °C (Figure 3, bottom). Each thymine imino proton exhibits a strong NOE cross-peak to the H2 proton of its adenine partner, within dA · T base pairs of the duplex (Figure 3, peaks A-D). Similarly, guanine imino protons display strong NOE cross-peaks to the hydrogen-bonded and exposed cytosine amino protons, within the dG · C base pairs (Figure 3, peaks E/E-H/H). In addition to these intra-base pair interactions, cross-peaks between adenine H2 and imino protons of flanking base pairs (Figure 3, peaks I-P) and among sequential imino protons (data not shown) suggest proper base stacking throughout the dG duplex. Chemical

shift values of the exchangeable protons, recorded at 5 °C and pH 6.9, are also listed in Table 1S (Supporting Information). Figure 4 shows changes on the exchangeable proton spectrum that occur upon acidification of the sample. At pH 6.01, dG N2H and the imino proton signals of residue 18 and dG16 become broader than at pH 6.90, suggesting the existence of chemical exchange at the lesion site. At this pH, three new signals appear in the imino proton region of the spectrum and two additional resonances are evident at 9.96 and 8.91 ppm (Figure 4, center spectrum, peaks marked with asterisks). At pH 4.92, resonances of the acid form become stronger and more evident while the dG N2H, dG18 N1H, and dG16 N1H signals detected at neutral pH are very weak and broad (Figure 4, bottom spectrum). Since the signals originating from the acidic form are rather broad, NOESY spectra recorded in H2O buffer (pH 4.92) failed to produce useful information and, as a result, proton assignment for the dG duplex under acidic conditions was not possible. Solution Structure of the dG Duplex. The experimental set of NMR restraints drove our computer simulations to a family of converging models, within the B-form DNA conformation, without severe deviations from the idealized covalent geometry (Table 1). Figure 3S (Supporting Information) shows a superposition of the seven models, which have a pairwise rmsd of <1.5 Å (<0.9 Å with respect to the average), whereas Figure 5 displays the energy-minimized average structure seen with the minor group prominent. The dG duplex is a regular right-handed helix, with non-lesion site residues in the anti conformation around their glycosidic torsion angles, sugar conformations in the C2-endo/C1-exo range, and Watson­Crick alignments present on all unmodified base pairs, including the lesion-flanking dC5 · G18 and dC7 · G16 base pairs. Figures 6 and 7 show close-up views of the lesion site structure, and Table 1 lists some relevant structural param-

eters. The dG residue is fully intrahelical and appears displaced toward the opposing strand of the duplex, favoring stacking mainly with the dG16 and dG18 residues of flanking base pairs, but without participation of hydrogen bonding (Figures 6 and 7). The lesion partner dC17 is located in the minor groove of the duplex, where it points toward the 3end of the damaged strand and forms a strong dC17 N4H-T9 O4 hydrogen bond (Figure 6).

pair form a 60° angle, with dG mostly sheltered from the solvent and dC17 largely exposed to water (Figures 6 and

Structure of dG-Containing DNA at Neutral pH 7). The glycosidic torsion ( ) angle of the lesion site residues appears outside the anti limit, in the -syn range. In the case of dG, adopts a narrow range of values, between -63° to -68°, which is close to the high anti range characteristic of canonical B-form DNA. In contrast, the angle of dC17 displays a broader range (Table 1). The conformation of lesion-flanking base pairs is quite regular with structural parameters within the B-form family and appropriate WC hydrogen bonding (Figure 6 and Table 1). DISCUSSION NMR Spectra of the dG Duplex. During our analysis of the NMR spectra, it became evident that the dG lesion induced only small perturbations at the center of the duplex structure. Proton chemical shift differences between the dGcontaining duplex and the unmodified control are significant only at the lesion site and the flanking base pairs (data not shown). The chemical shifts of protons that belong to the four terminal base pairs of the duplex, the intensity of their NOE cross-peaks, and the interproton distances derived from them all fall within the ranges observed for unmodified duplexes (Table 1S, Supporting Information, and Figure 2). Therefore, the subsequent discussion focuses on the structural characteristics of the central 3 bp segment of the duplex. Several observations indicate the existence of increased dynamics at the lesion site. At pH 6.90, the dG H10 and dG H11 signals are relatively broad (Figures 1S and 2S, Supporting Information) and those of dG H8 and the base (H5 and H6) protons of dC5 and dC7 are broader than analogous signals of non-lesion site residues (Figures 2 and 1S, Supporting Information). Finally, the pH dependence study of the exchangeable protons (Figure 4) produces conclusive evidence that a different conformation of the dG duplex appears at low pH. Notwithstanding the lack of spectral assignments, the appearance of up to four imino proton signals resonating in the 12.0­13.5 ppm range indicates prevalent WC hydrogen bonding of the low-pH duplex conformation. Furthermore, the pair of exchangeable proton signals at 9.96 and 8.91 ppm strongly suggests protonation of a cytosine residue at acidic pH, most likely the lesion partner dC17, with involvement of its amino group in hydrogen bonding. Several research groups, including our own, have described such a pattern during the formation of d(GCC+) triplets (39, 40). Our observation of a low-pH conformation is entirely consistent with the NMR characterization of a dG duplex at acidic pH communicated by Shanmugam and co-workers (25). In their poster, they showed that the duplex adopts a main conformation with dG in syn, forming a Hoogsteen base pair with its protonated dC+ partner, and the lesion-flanking A · T and C · G base pairs adopting WC alignments. The lesion sequence context used for our studies, d(...C-G-C..), was different from that used by Shanmugam and co-workers, d(...T-G-G...), suggesting that the acidic form structure of dG-containing DNA is independent of lesion sequence context. The NOESY spectrum recorded at pH 6.9 displays the characteristic sequential interactions between the base (purine H8-pyrimidine H6) and the sugar H1 (Figure 2), H2, H2, and H3 protons (data not shown) of the 5-flanking residue, indicating that the dG duplex adopts a regular right-handed helical conformation. The distinctly downfield values of

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 16, 2008 4611 dC17 H5, H6, and H1 proton chemical shifts (Table 1S, Supporting Information) suggests that dC17 does not stack properly between flanking bases. The high positive dC17(C6-H6) RDC value (20 Hz) indicates that the position of the pyrimidinic ring with respect to the helical axis is very different from that of other bases, arguing also for its nonstacked position (Table 2S, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the presence of a dC17 H5-A8 H2 NOE peak (Figure 2, peak F) clearly establishes the extrahelical position of the lesion partner dC17, more precisely, in the minor groove of the duplex and pointing toward the 3-end of the damage-containing strand. Solution Structure of the dG Duplex. The refined threedimensional model of the dG duplex shows excellent agreement with the main NMR observations without significant violations of the idealized covalent geometry (Table 1). The duplex structure is a regular right-handed helix, with the non-lesion-containing residues in the anti range, all deoxy sugars in the C2-endo/C1-exo conformation and regular WC alignments on all unmodified base pairs (Figure 5). The damaged base, dG, is located deep inside the helix, stacking between flanking dG16 and dG18 residues and extensively sheltered from solvent exposure (Figures 7 and 4S, Supporting Information). The chemical shift values of the dG H10 and dG H11 protons, which are significantly upfield from the base proton region of the spectrum, support the intrahelical orientation of dG in the refined structure. Furthermore, we have previously reported upfield chemical shift values for the etheno protons of dC in the dC · dA duplex (21), where the lesion-flanking base pairs were identical to those used in this study and the damaged residue adopted an intrahelical orientation analogous to the one observed for dG in this study. The extrahelical location of dC17 readily conforms to experimental restraints. While in the refined MD models dC17 enjoys an increased degree of conformational freedom, with a pairwise rmsd for the C17 residue in the 1.95­0.37 Å range among the converging models (Figure 3S, Supporting Information), the dC17 H5-A8 H2 distance is within the experimentally determined limits in all the structures. In addition, notwithstanding the many factors that affect proton chemical shifts, the downfield values observed for dC17 H5, H6, and H1 are in qualitative agreement with the solventexposed location of this residue. Downfield chemical shift values of dC protons have been observed previously in the case of a cis-anti-B[a]P-dG · dC duplex, where the lesion partner residue is positioned in the major groove of the helix and exposed to solvent (41), and very recently in the NMR characterization of a dG · dC duplex at basic pH (44). The refined duplex structure shows a strong hydrogen bond between dC17 N4H and T9 O4, which stabilizes the extrahelical minor groove conformation of dC17 (Figure 6 and Table 1). Effects of Sequence on the dG · dC Duplex Structure. There are similarities and differences between our neutralpH duplex structure, where the damaged residue is in the d(...C-G-C...) sequence, and the one reported by Shanmugam and co-workers at pH 8.6 (44) with the lesion present within the d(...T-G-G...) context. In both cases, the perturbations from a regular right-handed helix were mostly limited to the lesion-containing base pair, which has dG properly stacking between flanking bases while its counterbase is

extrahelical. Acidification of the buffer solution causes the appearance of a different lesion site conformation, which has the lesion partner protonated and hydrogen bonded to, most likely, dG N7 on the Hoogsten edge of the lesion. However, the pKa of this conformational transition depends strongly on the lesion sequence context, being at approximately neutral pH in Shanmugam's duplex and well below pH 5 in our study. Since G · C base pairs are more stable than A · T base pairs, it is conceivable that the latter breaks more easily, allowing the anti-syn transition of dG and the protonation of its counterresidue to occur at higher pH values. In addition to the pKa difference, there is a discrepancy in the position of the lesion counterbase, located in the minor groove in our study and in the major groove in Shanmugam's report, which cannot be easily explained by sequence context. We observe the formation of a hydrogen bond that stabilizes the lesion site dC residue extruded in the minor groove of the duplex. Since the heavy atom hydrogen bond acceptor is a sugar O4 atom, this interaction should, in principle, be independent of duplex sequence. When the dC residue is located in the major groove of the duplex, such interaction is absent and most likely replaced by hydrogen bonding with solvent. Therefore, the mechanisms responsible for this structural difference remain unclear. We are planning to run extensive free MD simulations in the presence of explicit solvent molecules to try to explain this intriguing discrepancy. Biological Implications. MUG, a bacterial DNA glycosylase that removes thymine or uracil residues from dG · T mismatches, also incises duplex DNA-containing dC or 1,N2-dG lesions. The major groove displacement of dC or thymine residues, observed in the structures of lesioncontaining and dG · T mismatch duplexes, led to the proposal that a positive change of the X displacement parameter would be a structural determinant during lesion recognition by MUG (24). In the refined models, dG X displacement is normal (-0.72 Å) or slightly changed toward positive values, indicating movement toward the major groove and suggesting that a similar mechanism may take place. However, X displacement variations are too small (maximum change of 0.37 Å) and variable to permit an authoritative conclusion. Y-Family DNA polymerases bypass dG lesions. In bacteria, Dpo4 incorporates dA or dG opposite dG, dependent upon the lesion sequence context (42). Human DNA polymerase  directs dG incorporation opposite dG, while DNA polymerases  and  incorporate dC and T to a similar extent (43). The observation that dG can adopt an anti or a syn conformation depending upon pH condition and duplex sequence (this work and refs 25 and 44) would suggest that Y-family DNA polymerases are sensitive to the lesion glycosylic bond, incorporating different bases opposed to each conformation. It would be interesting to determine whether a syn-anti conformational exchange also occurs on template-primer models containing dG residues.
