ABSTRACT: Crystal structures of catalytic domains of MMP-3 and MT1-MMP bound to TIMP-1 or TIMP2, respectively, differ in the orientation of the TIMP in the MMP active site. The orientation in solution of N-TIMP-1 in the MMP-3 active site has been investigated using residual dipolar couplings (RDCs). Fitting of the RDCs to the X-ray structures of the complexes suggests general agreement with the orientation of crystalline MMP-3(C) and TIMP-1 and a large disparity from the orientation of crystalline MT1MMP(C) and TIMP-2. Rigid body docking of MMP-3 and N-TIMP-1 X-ray coordinates using RDCs and intermolecular NOEs provided a time-averaged orientation in solution differing from the crystal structure by a 5° rotation toward the MT1-MMP(C)/TIMP-2 orientation. The slight discrepancy in orientations in solution and crystal lies within the experimental uncertainties. Intermolecular NOEs used in the docking corroborated the accuracy of mapping the interface by a paramagnetic NMR footprinting assay, a potential alternative source of contacts for docking. Some uncertainty in the N-TIMP-1 orientation in the MMP-3 active site, coupled with microsecond to millisecond fluctuations of the MMP-binding ridge of N-TIMP-1 in the complex and flexibility in MMP-3(C) S1 to S3 subsites, leaves open the possibility that N-TIMP-1 might dynamically pivot a few degrees or more in the arc toward the MT1-MMP(C)/TIMP-2 orientation. Differing TIMP orientations in MMP active sites are more likely to result from structural differences in TIMP AB hairpin loops than from crystal packing artifacts.

TIMP-11 and TIMP-2 were reported to orient differently in matrix metalloproteinase active sites (1). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc endopeptidases that act on extracellular matrix proteins during the connective tissue remodeling of development, reproduction, wound healing, cancer, arthritis, and other tissue degenerative diseases. Such activities of MMPs are inhibited by 1:1 molar binding by endogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) -1, -2, -3, or -4, typically with subnanomolar KI values (2, 3). The presence of TIMPs inversely correlates with oncogenicity (4). Transgenic overexpression of MMP-3 in mice stimulates the development of mammary tumors in mice, unless TIMP-1 is coexpressed (5). The N-terminal two-thirds of human TIMPs-1 or -2 (NTIMP-1 or -2) are sufficient to fold (6) with much better yield than full-length and to inhibit MMPs-1, -2, and -3 with KI values of 1-2 nM (7). The difference in KI of 1.4 nM

for N-TIMP-1 inhibition of MMP-3 from KI of 0.22 nM for full-length TIMP-1 inhibition of MMP-3 represents a GI of only 1.1 kcal/mol (i.e., 9% of GI (7)). N-TIMP-1 is being engineered to increase its selectivity among MMPs (8-10), a sought-after property for decreasing side effects of potentially therapeutic MMP inhibitors. Likewise, N-TIMP2, -3, and -4 are being successfully engineered for greater selectivity among metalloproteinases (10-13). Because of the therapeutic potential of engineered N-TIMPs for treating cancer and arthritis, better understanding of the MMP-binding mode of N-TIMP-1 is sought. High-precision NMR structures of N-TIMP-2 and N-TIMP-1 show that they comprise -strands A-F in a sheared barrel of the OB-fold, with helices 1 and 2 on one side of the -barrel (14, 15). MMP3(C) comprises -strands I-V and helices A-C (16). The backbone dynamics of N-TIMP-2 and N-TIMP-1, free and bound to the catalytic domain of MMP-3 (MMP-3(C)), have been characterized (17-19). Contrary to prediction, tight binding of MMP-3(C) by N-TIMP-1 is endothermic. Interestingly, part of the substantial favorable entropic free energy of binding appears to arise from conformational entropy gain introduced through much of the -barrel of N-TIMP-1 by binding of MMP-3(C) (19). X-ray structures are available for MMP-3 bound to TIMP-1 (20) and for MT1-MMP bound to TIMP-2 (1). With the MMP catalytic domains of these structures superimposed, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 differ in orientation in the MMP active site by 20, 10, and 5° rotations about orthogonal axes centered on TIMP residue 4 (1). This raises the question of the reason(s) for differing orientations in similar MMP active

Orientation of MMP-3 and N-TIMP-1 in Solution sites. Contributors to the differing orientation possibly include differences in the AB loop of the TIMPs, inherent flexibility in the thin MMP-binding ridge of the TIMPs, differences in the strand V to helix B loop of the MMPs, and perturbation by crystal packing effects. Using residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) measured from weakly aligned samples (21), solution NMR can accurately correct long-range orientations of protein complexes (22-25), domains (26, 27), and other biomolecular assemblies (28-30) in solution. We find that in solution, the apparent average orientation of N-TIMP-1 in the MMP-3(C) active site agrees within the uncertainty with the crystal structure of the complex of TIMP-1 with MMP-3(C). This suggests that the crystalline orientation is not significantly skewed by crystal packing and that the reported difference in TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in MMP active sites is more likely to be a consequence of structural differences such as those in the AB loops of TIMPs. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Assignment of NMR Peaks of Complex of MMP-3(C) with N-TIMP-1. To stabilize the complex of human MMP3(C) with N-TIMP-1 for NMR, an E202Q substitution in the MMP-3 active site was introduced (19) that preserves TIMP binding (31, 32) and the structure of MMP-3(C) (33). Details of preparing a homogeneous 1:1 complex and assignments of the backbone NMR peaks of N-TIMP-1 in the complex were described (19). Backbone assignments of the MMP-3(C) bound to N-TIMP-1 were obtained previously (19, 34). Conditions for NMR were 307 K, 20 mM Tris-d11, pH 6.22, 125 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 1 mM NaN3, and 50 µM ZnCl2. Side chain assignments of the MMP-3(C) component of the complex in 90% H2O relied on HCCH-COSY, HCCH-TOCSY, HCACO, and HNCO. Assignments of MMP-3(C) bound to a synthetic inhibitor (35, 36) also aided assignment of MMP-3(C) when bound to N-TIMP-1. About 80% of side chain assignments of MMP-3(C) E202Q in the complex were completed and deposited together with MMP-3(C) backbone assignments at BioMagResBank under accession code 5785. Missing side chain assignments were due either to severe overlap or broadening of methylene peaks. A similar strategy was used to assign the side chains of N-TIMP-1 in complex with MMP-3(C) E202Q. However, for 15N/13C N-TIMP-1 or 15 N/13C/50% 2H N-TIMP-1 bound to unlabeled MMP-3(C) E202Q, CBCA(CO)NH, C(CO)NH, and H(C)(CO)NH spectra were mostly incomplete, perhaps because of greater chemical exchange broadening of the lines of the N-TIMP-1 component of the complex (19). As a result, HCCH-TOCSY and 15N-separated NOESY, aided by assignments of free N-TIMP-1, were most fruitful for assigning nearly 70% of the side chains of N-TIMP-1 when bound to MMP-3(C) E202Q. These assignments have been deposited under BMRB accession code 5099. Measurement and Fitting of RDCs for Use in Orienting the Complex. To measure RDCs, N-TIMP-1 was labeled with 2 H/15N and bound 1:1 to MMP-3(C) E202Q as reported (19). The MMP-3(C) E202Q component of this complex was selectively labeled with 15N Ile,15N Val, and 15N/13C Leu that were part of a defined medium with the 17 other amino acids being unlabeled, similar to a previous selective labeling (35). A mixture of 5% PEG C12E6 with 1-hexanol at a molar ratio of 0.64 (37) was used to align a 0.17 mM complex of

1 DHRCR RDCs (40) suggested the Da parameter, describing the degree of alignment along the principal longitudinal alignment axis, to be 24.8 Hz, with respect to 1DNH values. Rhombicity values, R, ranging from 0.20 to 0.25 were obtained from fits of RDCs to structural coordinates using singular value decomposition (SVD) implemented in either PALES (41) or Module (29). Alignment tensors were visualized using Module. NOE Contacts between MMP-3(C) and N-TIMP-1. Preparation of samples of the complex in which one protein was uniformly enriched with 15N/2H to >97%, while the partner was unlabeled, enabled measurement of intermolecular NOEs between aliphatic protons of the unlabeled protein and amide protons of the 15N/2H-labeled partner (amide protons that returned by exchange during purification). 15N-separated NOESY-HSQC spectra (42) of the free proteins did not produce any cross-peaks in the aliphatic region, confirming their full deuteration. By contrast, 15N NOESY-HSQC spectra of the complexes of 15N/2H MMP3(C) E202Q with unlabeled N-TIMP-1 and of unlabeled MMP-3(C) E202Q with 15N/2H N-TIMP-1, obtained with mixing times of 220 and 250 ms, respectively, showed crosspeaks in the range of -0.7-5.7 ppm in the indirect 1H dimension (vertical 1H scale of Figure 3). The perdeuteration of aliphatic and aromatic groups decreased spin-diffusion in the detected amide spectrum during the long mixing times. Computation of Orientation of N-TIMP-1 in MMP-3(C) ActiVe Site in Solution. XPLOR-NIH (43) was used for rigid body redocking of human MMP-3(C) and the N-terminal 126 residues of human TIMP-1 (N-TIMP-1) from X-ray coordinates of the complex (PDB accession code 1uea (20)). While crystallography used substitutions of selenomethionine and N30A and N78A lesions in TIMP-1 (20), the solution

NMR herein used the wild-type N-TIMP-1 sequence. As discussed below, 46 intermolecular NOEs, 75 1DNH RDCs of N-TIMP-1, 19 1DNH RDCs of MMP-3(C) E202Q, and eight 1DHRCR RDCs of MMP-3(C) E202Q were used for solution docking. Starting structures were generated by rigid body minimization (22) and followed by restrained Cartesian simulated annealing in which the backbone was kept rigid by restraining to a duplicate molecule using noncrystallographic symmetry as described (23). (A more computationally efficient docking procedure using conjoined rigid body/ torsion angle dynamics has since become available but was not used (44, 45).) Interfacial side chains of the following residues were allowed to be flexible during the simulation: 162-169, 198-202, 205-206, 211, and 221-223 of MMP3(C); 302-304, 329, 333-335, and 366-369 of N-TIMP-1 (for convenience in the PDB file, 300 has been added to the normal TIMP-1 numbering). The target functions included terms for NOE-derived restraints, RDC restraints, and the radius of gyration. Interfacial contacts in structural models of the complex were compared using solvent accessibilities measured with NACCESS v2.1.1, available from http:// wolf.bms.umist.ac.uk/naccess/. N-TIMP-1 Binding Surface and Depth Dependence of MMP-3(C) Line Broadening by Gd-EDTA. Line broadening of protons (i.e., T2-1) below a surface with nonspecific collisions with a paramagnetic ion can be modeled by a simplification of the Solomon-Bloembergen expression:

The peak heights were normalized by the peak heights prior to addition of Gd-EDTA. For comparison, the depth of amide protons below the nearest Gd-EDTA accessible surface of uninhibited MMP-3(C) and MMP-3(C) with N-TIMP-1 bound was analyzed. Gd-EDTA accessible surfaces were modeled using GRASP (47) using a probe radius of 4 Å to represent the Gd-EDTA. To represent N-TIMP-1, the Cterminal domain of TIMP-1 was removed from X-ray coordinates of the complex (PDB code 1uea) (20). The small N-carboxy alkyl inhibitor was removed from X-ray coordinates of MMP-3(C) (PDB code 1sln) (48) to represent its free state. For measuring depth, protons were added to the two X-ray models. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Measurement of Residual Dipolar Couplings. Specific labeling of the valine, isoleucine, and leucine residues of MMP-3(C) E202Q was combined with uniform 15N/2H labeling of the N-TIMP-1 bound, followed by weak alignment with liquid crystals aligned in the magnetic field. This ensured an identical environment of alignment of the two proteins for measurement of RDCs used to orient them. The peaks of the hydrophobic residues of human MMP-3(C) have enough spectral dispersion that their specific labeling did not introduce much spectral overlap. The weak alignment was homogeneous and stable throughout RDC measurements since the D2O line was a sharp doublet with constant 22 Hz splitting at 305 K before and after each spectrum used to measure the RDCs of N-H and leucine C-H bonds. 1DNH RDCs of 102 residues of N-TIMP-1 and of 20 specifically labeled valine, isoleucine, and leucine residues of MMP3(C) were measured using IPAP-HSQC spectra of the single sample, both when tumbling isotropically as normal and when weakly aligned (Figure 1). Eight reliable 1DHaCa RDCs of leucines of the MMP-3(C) component were also obtained. Comparison of RDCs with the Crystal Structure. To evaluate consistency of the RDCs both with the global orientation of MMP-3(C) and TIMP-1 in their crystalline complex and with the structure's individual bond orientations, the RDCs were fitted by SVD to the X-ray structure (20). Figure 1B shows the correlation between the 27 RDCs (19 1 DNH and eight 1DHaCa RDCs) of MMP-3(C) with the RDCs calculated from the MMP-3(C)/TIMP-1 crystal structure (chain A of PDB 1uea). Deviations of measured RDCs from those calculated from a structure can arise from either static or dynamic differences (21, 49). Dynamic structural averaging over time scales ranging from picoseconds to several milliseconds can affect RDCs (49). Among MMP-3 residues with largest deviations between measurement and prediction from the crystal structure, the amide bonds of Val102, Leu222, Leu226, and Leu229 were reported to be comparatively flexible with S2 order parameters <0.80 (50) in MMP3(C) with an inhibitor bound in the S1- S3 subsites (see BMRB code 4364). (TIMPs bind both S1-S3 and S1- S3 subsites.) With the small inhibitor in S1- S3 subsites, Val102, Val127, Leu130, Val198, and Leu222 displayed at least 1.8 Hz of exchange broadening termed Rex, suggesting that they fluctuate on the microsecond to millisecond scale. Consequently, the deviating cases in the correlation of Figure

(B) MMP-3(C) residues most protected by N-TIMP-1 binding from line broadening by a Gd-EDTA probe are marked dark blue and numbered (34).

center, and is the Bohr magneton. The large value of H, the proton gyromagnetic ratio, makes proton lines especially sensitive to broadening. Since chelated Gd(III) has S ) 7/2, it is especially effective at relaxing proton lines, making it a successful MRI contrast agent (46). The N-TIMP-1dependence of MMP-3(C) amide proton line broadening by Gd-EDTA was assayed (34). Exposure of uninhibited 15Nenriched MMP-3(C) to 3 mM Gd-EDTA attenuated HSQC peak heights to a similar degree as exposure of the MMP3(C) bound to N-TIMP-1 to 2 mM Gd-EDTA, judging from peaks of residues far from the catalytic cleft. (The lower [Gd-EDTA] used with the complex is due to its being more

7954 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 26, 2003 1B might result from dynamic averaging of the backbone at some or all of residues Val102, Val127, Leu130, Val198, Leu222, and Leu226 of MMP-3(C) E202Q with N-TIMP-1 bound. Leu226 lies at a site that varies most among structures of MMPs. Since Val198, Leu222, and Leu226 are critical in forming the S1 principal specificity pocket, it is possible that this portion of the right side of the MMP-3 active site retains some residual flexibility in the interface with NTIMP-1. The 102 1DNH RDCs of N-TIMP-1 were fitted by SVD to the X-ray coordinates of TIMP-1 bound to MMP-3(C) (chain B of PDB code 1uea) (20). The majority of the N-TIMP-1 residues from the complex having the larger deviations of measured RDCs from those predicted from this X-ray structure (Figure 1C) coincide with sites of relatively greater flexibility. This higher flexibility is suggested by the parameters S2 (reporting picosecond to nanosecond motion) or Rex (reporting fluctuations over microseconds to milliseconds) from model-free fits of 15N relaxation (19). Such N-TIMP-1 residues include Ile19, Arg20, Asn30, Lys44, Gln50, Ala51, Leu52, Ala55, Tyr62, Gly71, Ser80, Ile85, Lys88, Leu108, Glu125, and Glu126 (Figure 1C). Omitting the eight most deviant of these RDCs (orange in Figure 1B,C), alignment tensors were fitted independently to TIMP-1 (using 96 1DNH RDCs) and MMP-3(C) (using 25 RDCs) main chains of the X-ray structure. The resulting orientation of the principal axes (AZ) of alignment of N-TIMP-1 and MMP-3(C) differed by 10° (Figure S1 of Supporting Information), raising the question of whether the proteins' orientation in solution and crystal might differ. Effects of Structural Uncertainty on Alignment Parameters. In principle, correlation plots of structurally predicted RDCs versus measured RDCs would be expected to have a slope of unity (dashed lines in Figure 1B,C). The slopes fitted are, however, less than 1.0 (solid lines in Figure 1B,C). This attenuation has been attributed to structural uncertainty (noise) that diminishes the apparent degree of alignment, Da (51). The slope of 0.81 of the RDC fit to the N-TIMP-1 component being smaller than the slope of 0.89 for the fit to the MMP-3(C) component of the complex suggests the possibility of greater structural uncertainty in the TIMP-1 chain of the X-ray structure. From SVD fitting of 1DNH RDCs to the individual proteins in the crystal structure of the complex, Da appears to be 22.5 Hz for MMP-3(C) and 18.4 Hz for N-TIMP-1. These underestimate the Da estimated from the powder pattern distribution of RDCs, which is 24.8 Hz (52). The underestimates of Da from SVD fits are also consistent with structural uncertainty in the X-ray coordinates (51). Because MMP-3(C) binding appears to increase flexibility through much of N-TIMP-1 and its -barrel core, with flexibility remaining in the interface (19), dynamic averaging is likely to contribute to the structural uncertainty of the TIMP-1 chain in the 2.8 Å crystallographic coordinates of the complex. This adds to static errors in the X-ray coordinates behind deviating RDCs. The MMP-bindinginduced flexibility increases were observed on scales of picoseconds to nanoseconds and microseconds to milliseconds, with the possibility of motions also on other time scales (19). Trimmed Set of RDCs for Orienting N-TIMP-1 and MMP-3 in Solution. 1DNH RDCs from disordered segments of the N-TIMP-1 backbone were excluded from docking

Arumugam and Van Doren calculations because low S2 order parameters should systematically attenuate RDCs (21). Excluded from use in docking were the 1DNH values of sites in loops or termini with S2 < 0.65 that imply picosecond to nanosecond fluctuations of significant amplitude, namely, N-TIMP-1 residues 49-58 of its BC loop, Arg75 from its CD loop, and Glu125 and Glu126 from its C-terminus (19). Also excluded from use in docking were 1DNH measurements differing from 1DNH calculated from the MMP-3(C)/ TIMP-1 X-ray structure by at least 13 Hz, implying either static or dynamic deviations from the crystal structure. These deviant 1DNH values are from N-TIMP-1 residues 9, 16, 19, 20, 30, 44, 62, 71, 80, 85, 88, and 108 and from MMP3(C) residues 123 and 242. Most of these N-TIMP-1 residues (i.e., Ile19, Arg20, Asn30, Lys44, Tyr62, Gly71, Ser80, Ile85, Lys88, and Leu108) display exchange broadening evidence of fluctuations on the scale of microseconds to milliseconds (19). Although measured 1DNH of Gly92 and Leu93 each deviate only by 10 Hz from prediction using X-ray coordinates 1uea, they were also omitted from rigid body docking because localized SVD fitting of sets of 1DNH values of N-TIMP-1 residues 89-94 of the X-ray coordinates showed a clear discrepancy for this segment of the backbone (19). The global orientations presented in Figure 4 and evaluated in Table 1 were obtained without use of the deviating 1DNH values listed above. Intermolecular NOE-DeriVed Contacts for Docking. For docking and enhancement of the orientational information from RDCs, intermolecular NOEs across the interface were gathered from samples in which one protein was unlabeled, and the bound partner was 15N-labeled and perdeuterated in its side chains. This resulted in the side chain to amide NOEs being intermolecular (Figure 2). Assignment of these intermolecular NOEs required side chain assignments of MMP3(C) and N-TIMP-1 in their complex that were obtained to about 80 and 70% completion, respectively. (Broad methylene peaks in this 34 kD, 299-residue complex were difficult to assign.) The MMP-3(C)/TIMP-1 X-ray structure corroborated assignments of the intermolecular NOEs of Figure 2. The amide protons of MMP-3 residues in and near -strand IV (i.e., Asn162, Val163, Ala165, Ala167, Tyr168, and Ala169, along with Ser206) are spatially close to the aliphatic side chains of N-TIMP-1 (Figure 2A). Thr2, Cys3, and Val4 of N-TIMP-1 insert in the right side of the active site (i.e., at the S1-S3 subsites) where they make contact with backbone and side chains of Asn162-Ala167 at -strand IV of MMP-3, as well as with Val198 and Gln202 of the active site helix and Pro221 and Tyr223 of the lower rim of the MMP-3 active site (Figures 2 and 4). On the left side (i.e., S1 and S2 subsites of the MMP-3 active site), the backbone of Ala167-Ala169 and Ser206 contact the side chains of Met66, Ser68, and Val69 of the AB loop of N-TIMP-1 plus its Cys1 (Figure 2A). Intermolecular NOEs Show Accuracy of Protection from Gd-EDTA in Mapping Interface. The intermolecular NOEs validate a paramagnetic NMR footprinting assay that was introduced to identify the surface of MMP-3(C) that binds N-TIMP-1 (34). The assay employs binding-induced protection of the labeled protein's surface from line broadening by a chelated Gd(III) probe (34). The MMP-3(C) amide groups with NOEs to N-TIMP-1 (Figure 2A) are marked on the structure of MMP-3(C) (Figure 3A). With remarkable

similarity, the surface of MMP-3(C) most protected from the broadening effects of Gd-EDTA when bound to NTIMP-1 includes the amides from Asn162 through Ala167 and Ala169 encompassing -strand IV (Figure 3A and Supporting Information Figure S2A). This is far more restricted and accurate set of interfacial residues than suggested by binding-linked chemical shift perturbations (34). The paramagnetic exclusion assay cannot assess bindingdependent occlusion of Ser206 because it is too recessed in the catalytic cleft. The NOE and paramagnetic protection results agree with changes in depth of amide groups of MMP3(C) below the surface accessible to a small paramagnetic probe in the absence and presence of N-TIMP-1 bound. Virtually the same set of residues undergo the greatest TIMP1-binding-dependent burial from the paramagnetic probeaccessible surface (i.e., Asn162, Val163, Ala165, His166, Ala167, and Ala169 of the upper rim of the active site cleft (Supporting Information Figure S2B)). Ability to detect an N-TIMP-1-binding linked conformational change in MMP3(C) exposing its C helix (34) is an advantage of the paramagnetic protection assay over intermolecular NOEs. Where intermolecular NOEs are not available, interface mapping using chelated Gd(III) could sometimes provide a more accurate alternative to 1HN/15N shift mapping for

providing the ambiguous distance restraints for the translational component of protein-protein docking procedures that use RDCs (24, 45). Apparent Orientation of N-TIMP-1 in MMP-3(C) ActiVe Site with RDCs, Without and With NOEs. To determine the average global orientation of N-TIMP-1 in the active site of MMP-3(C) in solution, the 102 most reliable RDCs were employed (i.e., those relatively free from picosecond to nanosecond and microsecond to millisecond dynamics). Pruning the deviant 1DNH measurements left 75 1DNH values from N-TIMP-1 and 19 1DNH plus eight 1DHRCR values from selectively labeled MMP-3(C) bound. Reorientation using only RDCs used the program Module (29) to reconcile the independent alignment tensors of N-TIMP-1 and MMP3(C) (Figure S1 of Supporting Information), resulting in the orientation in Figure 4 with N-TIMP-1 in blue. With MMP-3(C) superimposed, the backbone RMSD between X-ray structure (red in Figure 4) and the structure reoriented using only RDCs is 3.2 Å. Since the local RMSD systematically grows with distance from the interface, more meaningful is the angular difference of 9° between these models in red and blue in Figure 4. This rotation is in the arc toward the orientation in the crystal structure of MMP-3(C) bound to TIMP-2. This RDC-based reorientation reconciles the 10°

7956 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 26, 2003 discrepancy between the alignment tensors fitted to the two proteins in the crystal structure (Figure S1 of Supporting Information). The RDC-based reorientation (blue in Figure 4) agrees just slightly better with the RDCs in that its Q factor and R factor are slightly lower than those of the crystal structure (Table 1). To augment the orientation data from RDCs, the translational data of the 46 short distance contacts from intermolecular NOEs (Figure 2) were incorporated in rigid body docking using restrained simulated annealing in Cartesian space as described (22, 23) using XPLOR-NIH (43). Interfacial residues 162-169, 198-202, 211, and 221223 of MMP-3(C) and residues 2, 4, 29, 33-35, and 6669 of N-TIMP-1 were allowed flexibility in the otherwise rigid body docking. Inclusion or exclusion of the deviant 1D NH values (listed above) from docking using RDCs and NOEs with Cartesian simulated annealing (22, 23) had scarcely any effect on the calculated orientation of MMP3(C) and N-TIMP-1 in complex. This suggests this rigid body docking protocol to be robust in the face of uncertainty in starting coordinates and in measured RDCs. This procedure with NOEs added resulted in a tight ensemble of structures with 25 of 25 calculated structures having an average global backbone RMSD of the N-TIMP-1 chain of 0.14 ( 0.10 Å (Supporting Information Figure S3). Their orientation is intermediate between the X-ray and the RDCrotated orientations (i.e., 5° rotated from the crystal orientation in the same arc toward the MT1-MMP/TIMP-2 orientation). The lowest energy member of the tight ensemble is shown in green in Figure 4. This reorientation that supplemented the 102 RDCs with 46 intermolecular NOEs appears to be an enhancement over the X-ray or RDC-only orientations in that the Q and R factors are slightly better (Table 1). This structural model with enhanced agreement with the RDCs has been deposited in the PDB under accession code 1oo9. This model has N-TIMP-1 rotated slightly toward the S-shaped calcium- and zinc-binding III-IV loop atop the -sheet of MMP-3(C) (at right in Figure 4). Comparing surface accessibility of this model with the X-ray model suggests N-TIMP-1 to be rotated slightly deeper into the S3 subsite, mutually burying Val4 of N-TIMP-1 between Asn162 near -strand IV and Tyr223 of MMP-3(C) each a little deeper. Consistent with the importance of Val4 of N-TIMP-1 in MMP recognition, some mutations of Val4 can confer to engineered N-TIMP-1 greater selectivity among MMPs-1, 2, and 3 (9). In the solution model, the side chain of Val69 of the CD loop of N-TIMP-1 is also more buried in the heart of the interface. The intermolecular NOE-based distance restraints to the side chains of Val 4 and Val69 of N-TIMP-1 (Figure 2A) and to Asn162 and Tyr223 of MMP-3 (Figure 2B) allow the possibility that these residues could be more buried in solution. Uncertainty, and its Sources, in Orientation of N-TIMP-1 in MMP-3 ActiVe Site. From the apparent average orientation in solution resulting from use of both RDCs and NOEs, there is a 5° rotation back to the X-ray structure (red in Figure 4) and a 4° rotation ahead to the orientation based only on RDCs (blue in Figure 4). These latter two models agree with the RDCs almost as well as the intermediate orientation (Table 1). This suggests an uncertainty in the orientation of perhaps (5° about the intermediate orientation (green in Figure 4) that is more realistic than the uncertainty of < (1° suggested

Arumugam and Van Doren by the tight bundle of simulated annealing structures (Figure S3 of Supporting Information). Uncertainty in measured RDCs of (1 Hz appears to result in uncertainty in the Euler angle to the principal axes of alignment of MMP-3(C) and of N-TIMP-1 of (1 and (0.8°, respectively, based on simulated 1 Hz noise introduced into SVD fits (Figure S1 of Supporting Information). Error propagation then suggests around (1.3° uncertainty in global orientation resulting from RDC measurement error. The 46 intermolecular NOEs and 75 RDCs of N-TIMP-1 seem ample and robust sources of experimental restraints, particularly as the orientation is insensitive to inclusion of outlying 1DNH values from N-TIMP-1. However, it is possible that availability of more than the 27 RDCs from the MMP-3(C) backbone in the complex could decrease uncertainty in the global orientation. A larger source of the uncertainty in the global orientation is probably the structural uncertainty in the 2.8 Å crystal structure. Such uncertainty is manifest in the underestimated slopes in the RDC correlation plots of Figure 1B,C, in the underestimated Da measure of alignment (see above), and in the abundance of individual deviations between measured and calculated RDCs (Figure 1B,C). We have attributed most of the bigger deviations in N-TIMP-1 to dynamic averaging (19). Another viewpoint is to attribute the deviations to errors in the static X-ray coordinates. If the 5° difference between the crystal orientation involving full-length TIMP-1 and the calculated solution orientation involving N-TIMP-1 were not subsumed by random uncertainties, there is a potential source of subtle, systematic structural difference. The absence of the Cterminal lobe from N-TIMP-1 and the resulting lack of contacts with loops to the right of the primed subsites of MMP-3 might permit it to rotate toward these loops. This would be in the observed direction toward the crystallographic orientation of TIMP-2 in the MT1-MMP active site (PDB code 1bqq). This might allow N-TIMP-1 to pivot more than full-length TIMP-1. Possibility of Dynamic PiVoting of N-TIMP-1 in MMP-3 ActiVe Site. The evidence of residual flexibility in the interface of the MMP-3(C) complex with N-TIMP-1 suggests the possibility that slow dynamic averaging or pivoting of N-TIMP-1 in the active site of MMP-3(C) in solution could also contribute to the range of uncertainty in their orientation in solution. Model-free results on backbone dynamics of N-TIMP-1 in the complex are available (BMRB code 5154) (19). S2 of Thr2 of N-TIMP-1 in the interface being lower (0.85) than the average for the structured regions (0.92) is consistent with residual flexibility at this key site at the S1 subsite in the heart of the interface. Exchange broadening evidence of fluctuations on the microsecond to millisecond scale throughout the MMP-binding ridge of N-TIMP-1 (i.e., at Thr2, Cys3, Cys70, of the CD loop and residues 29-36 of the AB loop) further suggests the possibility that this thin ridge slowly fluctuates while in the MMP active site (19). Deviations measured from predicted RDCs on the MMP-3(C) side of the interface at Val198, Leu222, Leu226, and Leu229 (Figure 1B) could result from residual dynamic averaging in the primed subsites on the right side of the MMP-3 active site, especially around the central S1 subsite. Again, residual flexibility in this region of the MMP-3 active site was reported in the backbone dynamics of MMP-3(C) inhibited by small molecules (50).

Orientation of MMP-3 and N-TIMP-1 in Solution Since RDCs fail to rule out the possibility in solution that N-TIMP-1 may pivot in the MMP-3(C) active site in the arc of rotation defined by crystal structures of TIMP/MMP complexes, the range of possible orientations in solution was considered further. The RDCs measured from the complex of MMP-3(C) with N-TIMP-1 were fitted to the X-ray coordinates of MTI-MMP(C) with TIMP-2 bound (53) in an orientation rotated 23° about the active site relative to the MMP-3(C)/N-TIMP-1 crystal structure (20), in the same arc as seen in Figure 4. The much higher Q and R factors of this fitting to the MTI-MMP(C)/TIMP-2 coordinates (Table 1) suggest that this orientation is not compatible with RDCs of the MMP-3(C)/N-TIMP-1 complex in solution. The RDC fittings to the structural models (Table 1) suggest that the MMP-3(C)/N-TIMP-1 solution orientation is unlikely to sample orientations more than half the 18° rotation between the apparent average solution orientation of PDB code 1oo9 and that of the MTI-MMP(C)/ TIMP-2 crystal structure (PDB code 1bqq). Any possible time-averaged pivoting of N-TIMP-1 in the MMP-3(C) active site would be limited to rotations of less than 9° by potential contacts of Lys88 of TIMP-1 with Arg149 and Asp158 of MMP-3 and of Gln90 of TIMP-1 with Pro156 of MMP-3(C). Consequently, the N-TIMP-1 orientation in the MMP-3(C) active site is unlikely to transiently swing within 10° of the TIMP-2 orientation in the MT1-MMP active site. The differing orientations are unlikely to arise solely from skewing by artifacts of crystal packing. Crystal packing is more likely simply to freeze a TIMP into a favored lowenergy orientation in an MMP active site. The disparity in TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 orientations observed by crystallography (1) now appears most likely to result from differences in the protein structure in the interfaces. The much longer extension of the AB loop of TIMP-2 that projects over the top of the -sheet of MT1-MMP(C) (1) is likely to push TIMP-2 further in the general direction of the primed subsites of the MMP (cf. Figure 4). Contact between the C-terminal lobe of TIMP-1 and the V-B loop of MMP3(C) (20), plus potential contacts involving Lys88 and Gln90 of TIMP-1, might resist the push in this direction. In conclusion, the equivalence of the N-TIMP-1/MMP3(C) solution orientation with the TIMP-1/MMP-3(C) crystallographic orientation, within experimental uncertainty, implies that the crystallographic models reliably represent the orientations in solution. It also implies that engineered N-TIMPs bind MMP catalytic domains very much like fulllength TIMPs. The difference of 23° in TIMP-1/MMP-3(C) and TIMP-2/MT1-MMP(C) orientations is likely to result from inherent structural differences. The most obvious structural feature of short AB loops distinguishing TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 from the long AB loops of TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 may suffice to explain most of the range of orientations.
