HFE is a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related protein that is mutated in patients with the iron overload disease hereditary hemochromatosis. HFE binds to transferrin receptor (TfR), the receptor used by cells to obtain iron in the form of diferric transferrin (Fe-Tf). Previous studies demonstrated that HFE and Fe-Tf can bind simultaneously to TfR to form a ternary complex, and that membrane-bound or soluble HFE binding to cell surface TfR results in a reduction in the af®nity of TfR for Fe-Tf. We studied the inhibition by soluble HFE of the interaction between soluble TfR and Fe-Tf using radioactivity-based and biosensorbased assays. The results demonstrate that HFE inhibits the TfR:Fe-Tf interaction by binding at or near the Fe-Tf binding site on TfR, and that the Fe-Tf:TfR:HFE ternary complex consists of one Fe-Tf and one HFE bound to a TfR homodimer.

Introduction
The iron overload disease hereditary hemochomatosis (HH) is one of the most common genetic disorders, affecting between one in 200 and one in 400 Caucasian individuals (Merryweather-Clarke et al., 1997). The disease is characterized by inappropriate control of intestinal iron absorption, resulting in excessive accumulation of iron in organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas, eventually leading to multi-organ dysfunction (Anderson, 1996). The gene that is mutated in patients with HH encodes a protein called HFE that resembles class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in sequence ($38 % amino acid identity) (Feder et al., 1996) and in Â three-dimensional structure (Lebron et al., 1998). Both types of proteins are composed of a membrane-bound heavy chain containing three extracellular domains (a1, a2 and a3), which is noncovalently associated with the light chain b2-microAbbreviations used: HH, hereditary hemochromatosis; Fe-Tf, diferric transferrin; TfR, transferrin receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; hFcRn, human neonatal Fc receptor; KD, equilibrium dissociation constant; [125I]Fe-Tf, diferric transferrin labeled with iodine-125; RU, resonance units; CPM, counts per minute; BSA, bovine serum albumin.

globulin. The majority of HH patients are homozygous for a mutation that changes a cysteine residue in the a3 domain to a tyrosine residue (Cys260Tyr) (Feder et al., 1996) (our numbering begins at the ®rst amino acid of the mature HFE heavy chain; Â Lebron et al., 1998). This mutation abrogates the formation of a disul®de bond, preventing b2microglobulin association and cell surface expression (Feder et al., 1997; Waheed et al., 1997). A second mutation found in $70 % of HH patients who are heterozygous for the Cys260Tyr mutation changes an a1 domain histidine residue to an aspartate residue (His41Asp; H41D). By contrast to the Cys260Tyr mutant, the His41Asp mutant is expressed at the cell surface as a b2-microglobulin-associated heterodimer (Feder et al., 1997; Waheed et al., 1997). The similarity between HFE and class I MHC molecules provides no obvious clues to the function of HFE in regulating iron homeostasis. Class I MHC proteins function in the cellular immune response by binding and presenting peptides derived from intracellular proteins to T cell receptors (Townsend & Bodmer, 1989). HFE does not Â bind peptides (Lebron et al., 1998), interact with T cells, or serve any known function in the immune system. An initial clue linking HFE to iron metabolism came from the observation that HFE binds to transferrin receptor (TfR) (Parkkila et al., 1997; Feder et al., 1998), the receptor by which cells acquire iron in the form of iron-loaded transferrin

The TfR:Fe-Tf complex is endocytosed into acidic intracellular compartments, where iron dissociates from Fe-Tf. Apo-Tf retains a high af®nity for TfR at acidic pH and is recycled together with TfR to the cell surface, where apo-Tf is released from TfR at the basic pH of the blood (reviewed by Richardson & Ponka, 1997; Aisen et al., 1999). HFE is found in Tf-positive intracellular compartments (Gross et al., 1998), thus HFE presumably traf®cks with TfR from the cell surface to acidic intracellular vesicles. The interactions of TfR with Fe-Tf and with HFE have begun to be characterized. Fe-Tf binding to TfR has been studied using cell surface TfR (Richardson & Ponka, 1997, and references therein) and using soluble TfR lacking the transmembrane anchors (Borhani & Harrison, 1991; Â Lebron et al., 1998). Both the soluble and membrane-bound forms of TfR are homodimers that bind Fe-Tf with an af®nity of $5 nM Â (Lebron et al., 1998; Richardson & Ponka, 1997, and references therein). Two Fe-Tf molecules bind to a single TfR dimer, to produce a 2:2 TfR:Fe-Tf stoichiometry (Enns & Sussman, Â 1981; Lebron et al., 1998). Using soluble forms of HFE and TfR, it was shown that HFE binds TfR with nanomolar af®nity and that a TfR homodimer binds only one HFE at micromolar concenÂ trations (2:1 TfR:HFE stoichiometry) (Lebron et al., 1998). A ternary complex of HFE and Fe-Tf bound simultaneously to TfR can be formed Â (Lebron et al., 1998), and the binding of either membrane-associated HFE or soluble HFE to cell surface TfR results in a ®ve- to tenfold reduction in the apparent af®nity of TfR for Fe-Tf (Feder et al., 1998; Gross et al., 1998). The reduction in af®nity between TfR and Fe-Tf caused by HFE could arise because HFE binding to TfR has an allosteric effect on Fe-Tf binding, because the HFE and Fe-Tf binding sites on TfR overlap, or a combination of both. The mechanism of the

af®nity reduction can be addressed if the composition of the HFE:TfR:Fe-Tf ternary complex is determined. There are four possibilities for the composition of this complex, which produce the following HFE:TfR:Fe-Tf stoichiometries: 1:2:1, 1:2:2, 2:2:1, 2:2:2 (Figure 1). We used radioactivity-based and biosensor-based assays to study the inhibitory effects of HFE on the TfR:Fe-Tf interaction. We demonstrate that soluble HFE reduces the apparent af®nity of soluble TfR for Fe-Tf and interpret biosensor data to indicate that the HFE binding site on TfR overlaps with the Fe-Tf binding site. Thus HFE is a competitive inhibitor of the interaction between TfR and Fe-Tf, and the stoichiometry of the ternary complex is 1:2:1. These results are discussed in light of the role of HFE in iron homeostasis.

Results
HFE reduces the apparent affinity of soluble TfR for Fe-Tf To quantify the effects of HFE on the af®nity between Fe-Tf and TfR, we designed a cell-free, radioactivity-based assay using soluble forms of HFE and TfR. We used a soluble homodimeric version of TfR previously demonstrated to retain the properties of the membrane-bound version, i.e. high af®nity binding to Fe-Tf and to apo-Tf in a Â pH-dependent manner (Lebron et al., 1998). His-tagged TfR was immobilized on the surface of 96-well plates coated with an anti-His monoclonal antibody. We ®rst determined the af®nity of [125I]Fe-Tf for immobilized TfR in the absence of HFE. The binding curve obtained corresponds to an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of $1 nM (Figure 2(a)), consistent with what has been published for membrane-bound TfR (KD  5 nM; Richardson & Ponka, 1997) and for soluble TfR Â using a biosensor-based assay (KD $3 nM; Lebron et al., 1998). To assess the potential inhibitory effects of HFE on the TfR:Fe-Tf interaction, we assayed the binding of [125I]Fe-Tf to immobilized TfR in the presence of different concentrations of HFE. In order to mimic the situation in which HFE and TfR are in a complex at the cell surface, HFE was incubated with TfR prior to adding Fe-Tf. As shown by the binding curves in Figure 2(a), the observed af®nity of TfR for [125I]Fe-Tf is reduced as the concentration of HFE in the reaction mixture increases; thus, HFE reduces the apparent af®nity of soluble TfR for Fe-Tf. When the binding data are presented in the form of a Lineweaver-Burke plot (Figure 2(a), right), the resulting pattern is consistent with competitive inhibition (Creighton, 1993). Soluble HFE binds less strongly to immobilized TfR than does Fe-Tf (the KD of soluble HFE for Â immobilized TfR is $300 nM (Lebron et al., 1998) compared with a KD of $1 nM between Fe-Tf and TfR (Figure 2(a); left)), thus the inhibitory effects of HFE at concentrations up to 2 mm can be overcome

The amount of Fe-Tf bound to TfR in the presence and absence of HFE is plotted as a function of added Fe-Tf for duplicate experiments. Best ®t binding curves assuming a 1:1 binding interaction for each reaction are shown in dotted, broken, or continuous lines. The apparent KD for each curve is derived as the concentration of added Fe-Tf at the in¯ection point of the binding curve. (a) Binding curve (left) and Lineweaver-Burke plot (right) of Fe-Tf bound to TfR as a function of increasing concentrations of HFE. Only data points signi®cantly above background (corresponding to [125I]Fe-Tf concentrations above 0.2 nM) were included in the Lineweaver-Burke representation of the data. (b) Binding curve of Fe-Tf bound to TfR in the presence of a constant amount of various forms of HFE.

at high concentrations (100-300 nM) of [125I]Fe-Tf, as indicated by the binding curves all reaching approximately the same plateau. The effect on the af®nity between Fe-Tf and TfR is HFE-speci®c, since incubation of TfR with a high concentration of another b2-microglobulin containing class I MHC-like heterodimer (soluble human neonatal Fc receptor, hFcRn; A.P.W. & P.J.B., unpublished results) does not affect the af®nity between TfR and Fe-Tf (data not shown). We also repeated the binding assay using a high concentration of an HFE mutant that binds to TfR with an Â $5000-fold reduced af®nity (W81A HFE) (Lebron & Bjorkman, 1999). Like hFcRn, the W81A HFE mutant did not affect the af®nity between TfR and Fe-Tf (Figure 2(b)), thus high af®nity binding to TfR is required for a TfR:Fe-Tf af®nity reduction. By contrast, a soluble version of HFE containing one of the hemochromatosis mutations (H41D) has a similar effect on the TfR:Fe-Tf af®nity as wildtype HFE (Figure 2(b)).

The HFE binding site overlaps with the Fe-Tf binding site on TfR The binding experiments demonstrated that HFE reduces the apparent af®nity of soluble TfR for Fe-Tf and suggested that HFE is a competitive inhibitor of the TfR:Fe-Tf interaction. In classical enzyme-substrate-inhibitor studies, a competitive inhibitor exerts its effect by occupying the substrate binding site on the enzyme rather than exerting an allosteric effect (Creighton, 1993). To address if HFE inhibits the TfR:Fe-Tf interaction by binding to or overlapping with the Fe-Tf binding site on TfR, we performed a series of biosensor experiments in which we injected either TfR, HFE, or both over immobilized Fe-Tf. Since TfR is a homodimer that binds two Fe-Tf Â molecules (Enns & Sussman, 1981; Lebron et al., 1998), when soluble TfR is injected over immobilized Fe-Tf, we assume that some TfR dimers are bound by two Fe-Tf molecules to form a sandwich-

like high af®nity interaction with a slow dissociation rate. Other TfR molecules will be bound by only one Fe-Tf to form a lower af®nity interaction with a faster dissociation rate (Figure 3(a)). If so, low concentrations of TfR injected over Fe-Tf coupled at a high density should favor formation of the high af®nity, slowly dissociating FeTf:TfR:Fe-Tf sandwich complexes, whereas high concentrations of TfR injected over Fe-Tf coupled at a low density should favor formation of low af®nity, faster dissociating Fe-Tf:TfR complexes (Figure 3(a)). The normalized sensorgrams in Figure 3 show the effects of different Fe-Tf coupling densities on the binding of a low (5 nM) and high (200 nM) concentration of injected TfR. At the low concentration of injected TfR (Figure 3(b)), high af®nity, slowly dissociating complexes predominate at the high Fe-Tf coupling density (4,250 RU), which we interpret to indicate a predominance of TfR homodimers that are bound by two immobilized Fe-Tf molecules (doubly liganded TfR dimers; Figure 3(a)). The dissociation rate increases slightly at the low Fe-Tf density (140 RU), consistent with an increasing proportion of TfR homodimers bound by only one immobilized Fe-Tf (singly liganded TfR dimers; Figure 3(a)). At the high concentration of injected TfR over the low Fe-Tf

coupling density (Figure 3(c)), the dissociation rate increases still further, suggesting an increase in the proportion of singly liganded relative to doubly liganded TfR homodimers. In order to address the nature of the HFE:TfR:Fe-Tf ternary complex, an issue that is directly relevant to the mechanism by which HFE inhibits Fe-Tf binding by TfR, we injected soluble HFE over TfR:Fe-Tf complexes during the dissociation phase of the TfR:Fe-Tf interaction. If HFE binds to a different site on TfR than Fe-Tf, then HFE should be capable of binding to both doubly and singly liganded TfR dimers. Conversely, if the HFE binding site overlaps with the Fe-Tf binding site, then HFE should only bind to singly liganded TfR dimers. Figure 3(d) and (e) show the results when HFE is injected over the Fe-Tf:TfR complexes formed under the various conditions tested in Figure 3(b) and (c). The period of the HFE injection is indicated by the green rectangles in (d) and (e). For comparison, an equal volume of buffer was injected in (b) and (c) during the same time period, also indicated by green rectangles. As can be seen in the enlarged view of (c), the buffer injection results in only a minor perturbation of the dissociation phase due to refractive index changes between the injected and running buffers. HFE

243 forms of HFE and TfR (membrane-bound versus soluble). HFE binding to TfR does not result in a large effect on TfR's af®nity for Fe-Tf: a ®ve- to tenfold decrease in the case of cell surface TfR (Feder et al., 1998; Gross et al., 1998) and up to 40 fold in our assay using soluble TfR. The af®nity reduction (from a KD of $1 Â 10À9 M in the absence of HFE to an apparent KD of $4 Â 10À8 M in the presence of HFE) seems physiologically insigni®cant when the af®nities are compared to the high Fe-Tf concentrations present in the blood (>5 mM; Young et al., 1984). However, elucidation of the mechanism of the inhibitory effect can address the nature of TfR:Fe-Tf and TfR:HFE interactions, as well as the composition of the previously described Â HFE:TfR:Fe-Tf ternary complex (Lebron et al., 1998). We addressed the mechanism of the HFE inhibitory effect on the TfR:Fe-Tf interaction using a biosensor-based assay, in which we found that HFE binds preferentially to singly liganded TfR homodimers (TfR bound by one Fe-Tf) rather than doubly liganded TfR homodimers (TfR bound by two Fe-Tfs) (Figure 3(a)). These results suggest that HFE inhibits the TfR interaction with Fe-Tf by directly competing for the same or an overlapping binding site on TfR. The recent completion of crystal structures of TfR alone (Lawrence et al., 1999) and TfR complexed with HFE (Bennett et al., 1999) allows this conclusion to be directly tested. For example, alterations of some of the residues at the HFE binding site on TfR should affect binding to Fe-Tf if HFE and Fe-Tf bind to the same or overlapping sites on TfR. Since two Fe-Tfs bind per TfR homodimer (2:2 Â stoichiometry) (Enns & Sussman, 1981; Lebron et al., 1998), competition between HFE and Fe-Tf for TfR binding implies that the stoichiometry between HFE and TfR is also 2:2. A 2:1 HFE:TfR stoichiometry was obtained using micromolar concentrations of proteins in a gel ®ltration assay Â (Lebron et al., 1998) and by equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (L. Joss, J.A.L. P.J.B. & D.G. Myszka, unpublished results). However, at higher concentrations of protein, as occurs at high coupling densities on the surface of a biosensor chip (L. Joss, J.A.L., P.J.B. & D. G. Myszka, unpublished results) or in the millimolar concentration environment of the HFE:TfR cocrystals (Bennett et al., 1999), two HFEs bind to each TfR homodimer to produce 2:2 stoichiometry. These results are consistent with the idea that HFE binding to one side of TfR reduces the af®nity of the second HFE site on the TfR dimer, such that both HFE binding sites are occupied only at high protein concentrations. The observations that HFE and Fe-Tf can bind Â simultaneously to TfR (Lebron et al., 1998) and that they compete for binding require that the HFE:TfR:Fe-Tf ternary complex consists of HFE bound to one of the polypeptide chains of the TfR homodimer and Fe-Tf bound to the analogous region on the partner TfR polypeptide chain. The

does not bind detectably to Fe-Tf:TfR complexes when TfR is injected at the low concentration (compare (b) and (d)). By contrast, HFE binds detectably to some of the Fe-Tf:TfR complexes formed when TfR is injected at the high concentration (Figure 3(e)). As can be seen from the enlarged view of (e) (in which the response just prior to the HFE injection was set to zero for both sensorgrams for comparative purposes), proportionately more HFE binds in the conditions favoring the singly liganded TfR dimers. Taken together with the lack of observed binding signal for HFE when a low concentration of TfR was injected over immobilized Fe-Tf, these results suggest that HFE binds only to singly liganded Fe-Tf:TfR complexes. Thus HFE and Fe-Tf directly compete for binding to TfR, and the HFE:TfR:Fe-Tf ternary complex is predicted to have a 1:2:1 stoichiometry.

Discussion
HFE is a recently discovered protein involved in the regulation of iron metabolism (Feder et al., 1996). HFE binds to TfR, a receptor by which cells acquire iron in the form of Fe-Tf (Feder et al., 1998; Parkkila et al., 1997). Binding of HFE to cell surface TfR results in a reduction in the af®nity of TfR for its Fe-Tf ligand (Feder et al., 1998; Gross et al., 1998). The prominent role that TfR plays in the acquisition of iron (Richardson & Ponka, 1997; Aisen et al., 1999), as well as the high af®nity Â between TfR and HFE (Lebron et al., 1998), suggests that the formation of the HFE:TfR complex is critical for the function of HFE in iron metabolism. The effects of HFE on the af®nity between cell surface TfR and Fe-Tf were previously investigated. Two reports concluded that the interaction of either membrane-bound HFE (Feder et al., 1998; Gross et al., 1998) or soluble HFE (Feder et al., 1998) with TfR resulted in a lower af®nity for Fe-Tf, whereas a third report found no effect of HFE on the TfR:Fe-Tf af®nity (Salter-Cid et al., 1999). Our results are in accordance with the ®rst two studies, in that we ®nd that soluble HFE lowers the apparent af®nity of soluble TfR for Fe-Tf. The af®nity reduction is speci®c, since neither high concentrations of an irrelevant b2-microglobulin containing protein (hFcRn) nor an HFE mutant that has a greatly reduced af®nity Â for TfR (W81A) (Lebron & Bjorkman, 1999) affect the TfR:Fe-Tf af®nity. We do not see a signi®cant difference between the ability of wild-type HFE and the H41D hemochromatosis mutant to reduce the af®nity between TfR and Fe-Tf. This result is in contrast to a previous study investigating the effects of a membrane-bound version of this mutant on cell surface TfR, in which it was found that H41D HFE did not reduce the TfR:Fe-Tf af®nity to as great an extent as wild-type HFE (Feder et al., 1998). This discrepancy could be due to the use of different assay conditions or different

244 stoichiometry of such a ternary complex is one HFE to two TfR polypeptide chains (one homodimer) to one Fe-Tf (1:2:1 HFE:TfR:Fe-Tf; Figure 1). A 1:2:1 stoichiometry for the HFE:TfR:Fe-Tf ternary complex implies that HFE-bound TfR transports only half as many Fe-Tf molecules as TfR that is not complexed with HFE, since TfR dimers bind two Fe-Tfs in the absence of HFE (Enns & Â Sussman, 1981; Lebron et al., 1998). This hypothesis can be reconciled with the recently reported result that HFE expression does not affect the rate of FeTf taken in by HeLa cells (Roy et al., 1999) if one assumes the majority of Fe-Tf:TfR complexes formed were 1:1 rather than 2:1 under the conditions of the experiments (addition of 50 nM FeTf). At physiological concentrations of Fe-Tf ($5 mM; Young et al., 1984), Fe-Tf may displace HFE from some TfR molecules. However, since HFE is tethered to the same membrane as TfR, it is likely to compete effectively with Fe-Tf for TfR binding. Thus the relative concentrations of cell surface HFE and TfR and their spatial proximity in the membrane will be critical for determining how HFE affects Fe-Tf binding to TfR under physiological conditions.

HFE Inhibits the TfR:Fe-Tf Interaction (pH 9.6). After an overnight incubation (all incubations were done at room temperature), the wells were washed three times (one to two minutes per wash) with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8.0) containing 0.05 % (v/v) Tween-20 (PBS-Tween). To reduce non-speci®c binding, the wells were blocked with 200 ml/well of PBS containing 3 % (v/v) bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA) for at least one hour. PBS-BSA was removed from the wells and 75 ml of 10 mg/ml 6xHis-tagged TfR in 0.2 % PBSBSA was added to each well. Six hours later, the TfR solutions were removed and the plates were washed with 0.2 % PBS-BSA. Then, 75 ml of 0-2660 nM HFE in PBSBSA was added to the corresponding wells, and the solutions were incubated for six hours. After the incubation period, 25 ml of varying concentrations of [125I]Fe-Tf solutions in PBS-BSA buffer was added to the wells. Six hours later, the solutions were removed by aspiration and the wells were washed three times as described above using 0.2 % PBS-BSA. Wells were cut from the plate and counted using a gamma-counter (Gamma 5500; Beckman). Background responses (typically were $250 cpm) were subtracted and the resulting values for experiments done in duplicate were plotted as a function of the log [[125I]Fe-Tf] (Figure 2). We previously noted a coupling dependence of the derived af®nity between HFE and TfR in biosensor assays, such that when HFE was immobilized on a biosensor chip, the af®nity for injected TfR was $1 nM, but when TfR was immobilized, the af®nity for injected HFE Â was $300 nM (Lebron et al., 1998). This coupling dependent af®nity difference could arise because TfR homodimers can be cross-linked by adjacent HFE molecules on a biosensor chip when HFE, but not TfR, is immobilized, resulting in high af®nity complexes that dissociate slowly (L. Joss, J.A.L., P.J.B., D. G. Myszka; unpublished observations). The inhibition assay used to examine the effect of HFE on the af®nity between TfR and Fe-Tf corresponds to the situation in which TfR is immobilized on a biosensor chip, thus HFE is expected to interact with TfR with an af®nity of $300 nM in this assay. Biosensor-based experiments We used a BIACORE 2000 (BIACORE) biosensor system to monitor TfR binding to Fe-Tf and HFE binding to TfR:Fe-Tf complexes. Binding between a molecule coupled to a biosensor chip and a second molecule injected over the chip results in changes in the surface plasmon resonance signal that are read out in real time as resonance units (RU) (Malmqvist, 1993). Fe-Tf in 5-20 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was covalently immobilized using standard amine coupling chemistry on a CM5 chip (BIACORE) as described in the BIACORE manual to either a high coupling density (4250 RU) or to a low coupling density (140 RU). The different coupling densities were achieved by multiple injections (5 ml each) of the protein solution over the activated ¯owcell until the desired density was reached. TfR or HFE solutions (50-100 ml) were injected at room temperature in 50 mM Pipes (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.005 % (v/v) P20 at fast ¯ow rates (50 ml/minute).

Materials and Methods
Purified proteins Soluble HFE and soluble TfR were expressed and Â puri®ed as described (Lebron et al., 1998). The soluble version of HFE used for these studies is a heterodimer consisting of the extracellular version of the normally membrane-bound human HFE heavy chain (residues 1 to 275 of the mature protein) complexed with human b2-microglobulin. The soluble protein was puri®ed by immunoaf®nity and conventional chromatography from the supernatants of transfected Chinese hamster ovary Â cells as described (Lebron et al., 1998). A soluble version of TfR, which is normally a type II membrane protein, was produced in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. Soluble TfR is a homodimer consisting of a 6 Â His tag and a factor Xa protease Â site followed by residues 121-760 of TfR (Lebron et al., 1998). Lyophilized Fe-Tf (Sigma) was resuspended in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.025 % (v/v) NaN3 and puri®ed by gel ®ltration chromatography (Superdex-200 10/25; Pharmacia) to remove contaminants. [125I]Fe-Tf was obtained from ICN Pharmaceuticals with speci®c activities ranging from 0.7 to 1.0 mCi/mg. Lyophilized anti-His monoclonal antibody (anti-H(5); Qiagen) was resuspended in distilled water according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coef®cients at 280 nm of 96570 MÀ1 cmÀ1 (HFE), 83390 MÀ1 cmÀ1 (Fe-Tf), and 93790 MÀ1 cmÀ1 (TfR monomer) determined as described Â (Lebron et al., 1998). Radioactivity-based inhibition assay The wells of 96-well plates (Falcon 3912; Beckton Dickinson) were coated with 100 ml of a 2 mg/ml solution of anti-His monoclonal antibody in 0.1 M sodium carbonate
