Abstract Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) of the hyperthermophilic Archaea Pyrococcus woesei and Methanothermus fervidus have been purified to homogeneity. The enzymes from the two hyperthermophiles represent homo-tetramers of 100 kDa, contrary to all known bacterial and eukaryotic TIMs, which are dimers of 48-60 kDa. Molecular size determination of the TIM from the mesophilic methanogen Methanobacterium bryantii yielded the usual molecular mass of only 57 kDa, indicating that the tetrameric aggregation state does not represent an archaeal feature but rather correlates with thermoadaptation. A similar preference for higher protein aggregates in hyperthermophilic Archaea has previously been demonstrated for 3-phosphoglycerate kinases. The gene of the P. woesei TIM was cloned and sequenced. The archaeal TIM proved to he homologous to its bacterial and eukaryotic pendants. Most strikingly, the deduced protein sequence comprises only 224 residues and thus represents the shortest TIM sequence known us yet. Taking the three-dimensional structure of the eucaryal TIM as a basis, from the shortenings of the chain considerable rearrangements at the bottom of the ~[3 barrel and at its functionally inactive flank are expected, which are interpreted in terms of the formation of new subunit contacts.

1. Introduction Recent structure analyses of proteins from extreme thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms over the last two years provide a closer insight into nature's strategies for stabilizing the native protein conformation under extreme temperature conditions. From the various studies different featu,'es have been discussed as responsible for the increased conformational stability at all three levels of protein structure (c~,re region and secondary structure elements, interactions between domains and subunits): e.g. reduction of solvent acce~sible area and increase in the fraction of buried atoms [1], st~bilization of a-helices, strengthening of polypeptide chain teTmini and loops [2], shortening of loops [3], increase of ion bridges and hydrophobic interactions [4-6]. The observation that especially the subunit contacts are intensified by a strikin!; increase in ion pairs (as found for the malate dehydrogenas,," from Thermusflavus [6] and the glutamate dehydrogenase fr~,m Pyrococcusfuriosus [5]) and hydrophobic interactions (as reported for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase fr~,m Thermotoga maritima [4]) suggests that the subunit con*(orresponding author.

tacts are highly critical sites for protein stability. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments with aldolase [7] point further to the importance of the subunit contacts for the thermostability of the whole molecule and explain the preferred strengthening of the subunit interactions in proteins from thermophiles. To enlarge the data set for deduction of common traits in protein thermoadaptation we focus on triosephosphate isomerases (TIM; EC 5.3.1.1) of the hyperthermophilic Archaea Methanothermus fervidus and Pyrococcus woesei with growth optima at 83°C or 100°C, respectively [8,9]. No data are available yet about structure and function of archaeal TIMs, although their presence in glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways of archaeal organisms has been proved [10-12]. TIM catalyzes the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and represents one of the most thoroughly investigated enzymes. More than 30 sequences from bacterial and eukaryotic TIMs have been published so far, for three eukaryotic enzymes the threedimensional structure [13-16] could be solved and the enzyme mechanism has been extensively studied with wild-type and mutant enzymes [17]. All naturally occurring TIMs studied so far are homomeric dimers. A certain exception is represented by the bifunctional 3-phophoglycerate kinase/triosephosphate isomerase fusion protein from 72 maritima, which forms a homo-tetramer [18]. The tertiary structure of TIM is characterized by a compact eight-stranded ~ barrel, a motif strikingly often used in proteins with different functions (cf. [19]). Virtually all active site residues are located in the loops connecting 13-strands and the following or-helices at the top of the barrel. The subunit contacts are very extensive, characterized by a hydrophobic patch and a large protruding loop ('interface loop') fitting into a cervice of the neighbouring subunit near the active site. 2. Material and methods
2.1. Organisms Cells of P. woesei (DSM 3773) and M. fervidus (DSM 2088) were grown as described [20]. For cloning the tim gene of P. woesei, the E. coli strain XL1-Blue was used [21]. Cells of Methanobacterium bryantii were a gift from Prof. H. Krnig (University of Ulm). 2.2. Plasmids, enzymes, chemicals Vector pBluescript II KS+ [21] was used for cloning and sequencing. Fluorescein-15-dATP was purchased from Pharmacia (Freiburg, Germany), the Digoxigenin kit from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). The TSK gel for gel filtration experiments was from Toyosoda (Tokyo, Japan). All other enzymes and chemicals applied for molecular-genetic and biochemical experiments were the same as described elsewhere [20]. 2.3. Standard enzyme assay The assay (conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) was performed at 70°C and contained 100 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4 at 70°C), 5 mM arsenate, 10 mM NAD +, 4 mM

2.4. Purification of the TIM of P. woesei and M. fervidus 20 g wet cells were suspended in 30 ml buffer A (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.35 containing 30 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and disrupted three times in a French pressure cell at 150 MPa. After centrifugation (30 min, 40000Xg) the supernatant was heated to 95°C (P. woesei) or 80°C (M. fervidus), respectively, for 30 min and then centrifuged again (30 min, 40000xg). The supernatant was fractionated by ammonium sulfate (P. woesei, 45%-75% saturation; M. fervidus, 50%-80% saturation). After dialysis against buffer A, the protein solution was loaded on an ion-exchange column (Q-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia), diameter 26 mm, volume 100 ml, flow 4 ml/min) equilibrated with buffer A containing 10 mM KC1. After rinsing the column with buffer A containing 50 mM KC1 (P. woeseO or 330 mM KC1 (M. fervidus) the enzyme was eluted by increasing the KC1 concentration either to 150 mM in one step (P. woeset) or by a linear gradient from 300 mM to 450 mM (M. fervidus). The pooled fractions containing activity were dialyzed against buffer A and centrifuged (30 rain, 40000xg) to remove precipitates. After addition of ammonium sulfate (final concentration 1.3 M), the solution was loaded on a fastflow phenyl-sepharose column (Pharmacia; diameter 16 mm, volume 20 ml, flow 2 ml/min). The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (500 ml) from 1.3 M to 0.0 M ammonium sulfate in buffer A without 2-mercaptoethanol, but containing 30% ethylene glycol. Pooled fractions were then loaded onto a gel filtration column (HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.35, containing 300 mM KC1. The purity of the fractions was checked by SDS/PAGE. 2.5. Cloning and sequencing the tim gene of P. woesei Preparation and blotting of the genomic DNA of P. woesei was done as previously described [20,22]. Sequencing was carried out according to the protocol of Wiemann et al. [23] using an Automated Laser Fluorescent DNS Sequencer (Pharmacia, Germany). Based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the P. woesei TIM (AKLKEPIIAINFKTYIEATGKRALEIAK) two degenerated oligonucleotides were designed corresponding to the heptapeptide NFKTYIE (oligol: aay tty aar acn tay ath ga; oligo2: aat ttt aaa acw tat aaa ga) to screen for the coding gene in Southern blot experiments using genomic DNA digested with different restriction enzymes. Hybridization and detection of the signals was carried out with the Digoxigenin kit (Boehringer) following the recommendations of the manufacturer. A 3.3-kb XbaI fragment, which was found to specifically hybridize with the probe, was cloned using pBluescript II KS + as vector and E. coli XL1 Blue as recipient. Positive clones were analyzed by restriction analysis. The sequence of the gene was determined on both strands. 2.6. Molecular mass determinations Molecular mass determinations for the native proteins were performed by gel filtration and density gradient ultracentrifugation experiments. For the gel filtration experiments with the TIMs of P. woeseL M. fervidus and M. bryantii a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200

prep grade column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.35, containing 300 mM KCI was applied. For calibration the following marker enzymes were used: ferritin (horse), alcohol dehydrogenase (yeast), D-lactate dehydrogenase (Lactobacillus leichmannit), TIM (mouse), 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (yeast), cytochrome c (beef). In parallel experiments, the molecular mass of the TIM from M. fervidus was determined with other gel matrices (TSK gel, Toyosoda; Sephadex G-100, Pharmacia) under the same conditions. In a second approach, the molecular mass of the M. fervidus enzyme was determined by density gradient ultracentrifugation (1030% sucrose in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.5, total volume 5 ml, 15 h 180000xg, fraction size 100 p.1) with alcohol dehydrogenase (yeast), D-lactate dehydrogenase (L. leichmannit) and cytochrome c (beef) as marker proteins. Heat stability tests, protein determination and SDS/PAGE were done as previously described [22].

M. fervidus l'he thermostability of the enzyme from P. woesei was determined by inactivation kinetics at temperatures between 104 and 111°C (Fig. la). The inactivation followed first-order kinetics (Fig. lb) and the velocity of inactivation proved to be independent of the protein concentration (range tested: 4-20 ~/ml). With a half-life of inactivation of 280 min at 104°C (corresponding to the upper growth limit of the organism) the tb2rmal stability of the P. woesei TIM is considerably higher t h m that of the M. fervidus enzyme exhibiting only a half-life of inactivation of 60 min at 88°C (5°C above the optimal growth temperature). Like other enzymes from this organism [2il,24], also the M. fervidus TIM obviously depends on extr~ nsic stabilizers for its in vivo function. Detailed analyses of so ute-protein interactions to investigate the stabilizing influence of the cellular milieu are under way.

Fig. 2. Molecular mass determination of the TIMs from P. woeseL M fervidus and M. bryantii by gel filtration on HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200. The elution diagram of the archaeal TIMs is shown (11 M. fervidus; · P. woesei; · M. bryantiO together with the elution maxima (v) of different marker enzymes used for calibration of the column. The arrows indicate the deduced molecular masses.

Molecular mass determination under non-denaturing conditions yielded values of 99.6 + 6.0 kDa (TIM of P. woesei; by gel filtration on Superdex 161200; Fig. 2) or 100+6.0 kDa (TIM of M. fervidus; by gel filtration on three different matrices (see section 2) and sucrose density ultracentrifugation; Figs. 2 and 3), respectively. Considering the subunit masses determined by SDS/PAGE, the data account for homo-tetramers under native conditions. These findings are in contrast to the known TIMs from Bacteria and Eucarya, which form dimers with molecular masses of 48-60 kDa. Molecular mass determinations with protein extracts of the mesophilic Archaeum, Methanobacterium bryantii (optimal growth temperature: 37°C) enriched by ammonium sulfate fractionation yielded values of 57 + 6.0 kDa for the TIM (Fig. 2) indicating the usual dimeric association. From that, one should conclude that the tetramer formation of the TIM of P. woesei and M. fervidus does not represent a domain-specific feature, but rather correlates with the adaptation to higher temperatures. Interestingly, a similar "thermophilic" trend to a higher aggregation state is also observed by comparing 3-phosphoglycerate kinases of M. bryantii (monomeric enzyme) and the hyperthermophiles P. woesei and M. fervidus (dimeric enzyme) [20]. Also the tetramer formation of the PGK/TIM fusion protein isolated from the hyperthermophilic bacterium T. maritima [18] seemingly follows this trend. Since the unfused PGK protein, which is also produced in this organism, forms "normal" monomers, one may suggest that -- in analogy to the TIMs from thermophilic Archaea -- the higher association state of the bifunctional fusion protein is caused by the TIM moiety. However, it cannot be ruled out that the higher association is due to fusion-specific rearrangements of the polypeptide chains.

248 From the suggested importance of the intersubunit contacts for thermostabilization, as deduced from experimental and comparative studies on various oligomeric enzymes [4-7], one should expect that the benefit of the higher association state resides in an increase of protein thermostability. The observation that the preference of a higher association state does not generally apply (or even countercurrent trends occur, as shown in the case of the enolases [25]) indicates that the advantage of association is limited by functional and/or structural restraints. Possibly, proteins whose low volume/surface ratio needs additional intermolecular interactions for stabilizing the core structure like proteins with short peptide chains (TIM) or proteins consisting of rather independent domains with lose contacts between them (like PGK) especially profit from the higher aggregation state. Additionally, we must assume that the stabilization potential of the additional contacts can only be used by proteins whose topology allows subunit association without restriction of the conformational flexibility of the active site region.
3.4. The nucleotide sequence of the tim gene of P. woesei The tim gene encompasses 678 bp (Fig. 4). The G+C content of the gene has been calculated to be 44.8%, exceeding significantly the average G+C content of the genomic D N A (37.5% [9]). The codon usage is characterized by a preference for codons with A or T at the third position with the only exceptions of the triplets coding for Lys and Tyr. In front of the coding region, sequences could be identified which showed similarities to the complementary consensus sequence of the 3' end of the archaeal 16S rRNA (pos. - 6 to - 1 2 ) as well as to consensus sequences established for the

Box A and Box B elements of the archaeal promoter (pos. - 1 5 , - 1 6 ; pos. - 3 7 to - 4 2 ; [26,27]) suggesting that these sequences possess functional importance as translational and transcriptional signals. Downstream of the coding region two five-T stretches follow (pos. 709-713; 718-722) corresponding to a putative transcription termination signal [28]. The presence of putative promoter and transcription termination signals suggests that the tim gene of P. woesei is not cotranscribed with other genes coding for enzymes of the EmbdenMeyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway as was found for some bacterial species [29-31].
3.5. Deduced amino acid sequence of the tim gene of P. woesei The reading frame codes for 225 residues. Since, however, the N-terminal Met residue is missing in the mature protein (as shown by protein sequencing, cf. section 2), the TIM subunit comprises only 224 residues with a theoretical molecular mass of 23 697 Da. This value corresponds well with the apparent subunit molecular mass of 24 000 Da as determined by SDS PAGE.

chaeal TIM as homologous to the bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes (Fig. 5). As expected, the functionally important residues (Lys 14, His 99, Glu 171 (Fig. 5); numbering of the residues according to the T. brucei sequence: Lys 13, His 95, Glu 167) are conserved. Out of the 14 highly conserved residues involved in the dimer interface interactions of the eucarya', TIMs [16], 8 are present in the P. woesei sequence indicating similar subunit contacts also in the archaeal enzyme. Despite unequivocal homology, the average similarity betx~een the Pyrococcus TIM sequence and the bacterial or eukaryotic sequences is rather low, ranging from 17.4% to 23.8% id~ntity as compared to the identities between bacterial and euzaryal sequences, which exceed 38%. Thus, the relationship between archaeal, bacterial and eucaryal TIMs corresponds to that already found for the enzymes of the EMP pathway, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 3-phosphoglTcerate kinase exhibiting a lower similarity between the archaeal and bacterial or eukaryotic homologues than between th~ latter ones [20,32]. Most strikingly, the TIM of P. woesei represents, with 224 amino acids, the shortest TIM sequence known up to now. For optimal alignment 4 gaps have to be inserted, with the greatest bt tween pos. 146 and 165 (Fig. 5). Assuming a similar secondal¢ structure arrangement as determined for the TIM of T. blwei, one gap is located within the loop between helix H2 al~d 13-strand B3 (pos. 60-62), one gap eliminates c~-helix H5 c<~mpletely (pos. 146-165) and two further gaps shorten the helices c~-H4 (pos. 119 122) and H6 (pos. 198-201). On the b~sis of the known spacial TIM structure [19], these gaps cluster" at the bottom of the barrel and/or on that flank of the b~rrel without obvious functional importance (Fig. 6). From these changes one would expect a considerable structural reaJ rangement at the barrel bottom and at the barrel flank by eliminating c~-helix H5. These rather localized changes may be c< rrelated with the formation of new subunit binding sites in t[ e tetrameric TIM. We propose a model, in which the dimer-

ization of the TIM dimers occurs via the bottom and the functionally inert flank of the barrel (Fig. 7). Assuming that the TIM dimers are connected by the usual interface [16], a rather compact tetramer with four freely accessible active sites would result, whose globular structure is also claimed by gel filtration experiments. Ongoing crystallographic studies will reveal the validity of this model and give insights into the contribution of the additional subunit contacts to protein stability.
