Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are effective in lowering intraocular pressure, the primary indication of glaucoma. Human carbonic anhydrase II, and possibly carbonic anhydrase IV (CAII and CAIV, respectively), help regulate fluid secretion into the anterior chamber of the eye. Because inhibitors currently formulated as drugs to treat glaucoma were designed to target CAII, an understanding of the structural basis of CAII-CAIV discrimination by inhibitors would be useful for probing the role of each isozyme in the etiology of the disease. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structures of three novel thieno[3,2-e]-1,2-thiazine-6-sulfonamides complexed with CAII and the computationally predicted structures of the same compounds complexed with CAIV. All three compounds bind with similar affinity to CAII, but they bind with up to 100-fold lower affinities to CAIV. Comparisons of experimentally determined structures of CAII-inhibitor complexes and computationally predicted structures of CAIVinhibitor complexes allow us to rationalize these affinity trends and outline molecular features that may contribute to high-affinity inhibitor binding to CAIV. This study demonstrates how experimental structure determination methods and computational structure prediction methods can be used together to answer questions that cannot be answered by either method alone.
Introduction All mammals express one or more of the carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes, each of which catalyzes the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to bicarbonate and a proton.1,2 Human carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), one of the most efficient isozymes with kcat/KM ) 1.5 × 108 M-1 s-1, is found in the kidney, brain, pancreas, gastric mucosa, skeletal muscle, retina, and the lens.3 Inhibitors of CA are successfully used to treat the main symptom of glaucoma, elevated intraocular pressure, which is responsible for retinal degeneration and blindness.4-6 The inhibition of ocular CA decreases sodium and aqueous humor secretion, thereby lowering intraocular pressure. CAI, CAII, and CAIV are expressed in the human eye; CAII, and possibly CAIV, appears to play a greater role in regulating intraocular pressure.7,8 Inhibitors of the CAs that are currently prescribed for glaucoma therapy, such as Diamox (acetazolamide),9,10 Trusopt (dorzolamide),11 and Azopt (brinzolamide),12-15 are mainly used or designed to target CAII. CAII inhibitors typically exhibit lower affinity toward CAIV; for example, brinzolamide binds to CAII and CAIV with Kd values of 3.2 and 45.3 nM, respectively.12-15 Therefore, the development of isozymespecific CA inhibitors may ultimately benefit the treatment of glaucoma patients insofar as one particular isozyme might be predominantly responsible. The X-ray crystal structure of human CAII was first reported by Liljas and colleagues,16 and the structures of human and murine CAIVs were reported by Stams

and colleagues.17,18 Human CAII and CAIV are structurally and kinetically2,19 quite similar despite the fact that CAII is a cytosolic protein and CAIV is a membraneassociated protein. The sequence identity between CAII and CAIV is 33%, and these isozymes share the same overall 10-stranded -sheet fold. The active site of each isozyme contains a single zinc ion, which is coordinated by three histidine residues (His-94, His-96, and His-119) and a hydroxide ion at the bottom of a 15 Å deep hydrophobic cleft. Catalytically required residues Thr199, Glu-106, and His-64 are conserved in CAII and CAIV. His-64 has been identified as the "proton shuttle" that transfers a proton from zinc-bound water to bulk solvent.20 Two ordered water molecules between His64 and Zn-OH2 form a hydrogen bond network across which proton transfer is achieved by Grotthuss diffusion.2,21 Two distinct His-64 conformations have been observed in CAII and CAIV crystal structures. His-64 can adopt the "in" conformation (with the imidazole ring directed toward zinc) or the "out" conformation (with the imidazole ring directed away from zinc). The X-ray crystal structure of native human CAII at pH 8.5 shows that His-64 predominantly adopts the in conformation,21 whereas the crystal structure at pH 5.7 (at which His64 is protonated) shows that His-64 adopts the out conformation.22 In human CAIV, His-64 occupies the out conformation at pH 5.1, consistent with the behavior of His-64 in CAII.17 However, in murine CAIV,18 His-64 occupies the out conformation even at pH 7, which contrasts with the pH-dependent conformational behavior of this residue in the human isozymes. Importantly, the conformational change of His-64 to the out conformation is proposed to enhance inhibitor affinity in certain CAII-inhibitor complexes.23

The most notable structural difference between CAII and CAIV is found in the Lys-124-Glu-138 segment (CAIV numbering). In CAIV, this segment forms an ordered loop that extends away from the active site cavity (this loop is ordered in only one of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit17); in CAII, the corresponding segment is an R-helix.21 Additionally, Pro202 and Phe-131 lie at the mouth of the active site cleft in CAII. These residues are replaced with the smaller side chains of Thr-202 and Val-131 in CAIV. Consequently, the active site cleft of CAIV is less constricted than that of CAII. Differences in the structure and stability of the mouth of the active site of each isozyme may possibly be exploited in the design of isozymespecific inhibitors. As the first step toward the rational design of isozyme-specific CA inhibitors, we have determined the X-ray crystal structures of three structurally related sulfonamide inhibitors complexed with human CAII (Table 1).12-15,24 Strikingly, these inhibitors bind to CAII with similar affinity, but they bind to CAIV with up to 100-fold weaker affinity. Such affinity differences are likely due to pendant "tail" groups that interact differently with the mouth of each isozyme active site. Because of difficulties in preparing inhibitor complexes with human CAIV, we have predicted the structures of human CAIV-inhibitor complexes using computational methods. The CAs are ideal candidates for such structural and computational studies of inhibitor binding because numerous crystal structures of enzyme-inhibitor complexes determined to date show that few conformational changes of enzyme residues accompany inhibitor binding. Thus, CAII and CAIV are essentially static ligand receptor molecules, which simplifies structural and computational analysis. Results X-ray Crystal Structures of CAII-Inhibitor Complexes.

hydroxyl side chain of Thr-199, and a sulfonamide Sd O group accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone NH group of Thr-199. The endo-sulfonamide of each inhibitor likewise makes identical interactions: one SdO group accepts a hydrogen bond from Gln-92, and the other SdO group accepts a weak C-H hydrogen bond from Phe-131. These interactions are characteristic for the binding of thienothiazine-6-sulfonamides to CAII.18,25 Notably, His-64 shifts to the out conformation in each enzyme-inhibitor complex, even though it is not sterically forced to do so. At pH 8.0, the in conformer is expected to predominate. Possibly, the conformational change of His-64 to the out conformation may contribute to enhanced enzyme-inhibitor affinity due to the displacement of a bound water molecule.23 The interactions of the pendant tail groups are similar for AL-6619 and AL-6629: the morpholino group associates with the hydrophobic patch defined by Phe-131, Val-135, and Pro-202, and the meta-substituted phenyl group makes van der Waals contact with Asn-67, Ile91, and Phe-131. AL-6619 and AL-6629 differ by only the methylation of the meta hydroxyl group, so it is not too surprising that the overall binding conformations of these inhibitors are nearly identical. The aliphatic ether tail of AL-8520 associates with the hydrophobic patch defined by Phe-131, Val-135, and Pro-202. Note that this same region of the hydrophobic cleft is occupied by the morpholino group in the binding of AL-6619 and AL-6629. The primary amine donates a hydrogen bond to Thr-200. It is interesting to note that the configuration of the endo-sulfonamide nitrogen differs for aromatic substituents (AL-6619, AL6629) and aliphatic substituents (AL-8520). Accordingly, the endo-sulfonamide substituents occupy different locations in the enzyme active site: the meta-substituted phenyl groups of AL-6619 and AL-6629 occupy the Ile-91 canyon, whereas the aliphatic ether tail of AL-8520 occupies the Val-135 canyon (Figure 2). Apparently, specific interactions in the Ile-91 canyon (e.g., the orientation of the enzymeinhibitor aromatic-aromatic interaction and/or other weakly polar interactions with the inhibitor aromatic ring) contribute to binding differences between inhibitors bearing aromatic or aliphatic substituents on the endo-sulfonamide nitrogen. Moreover, the binding of the morpholino groups of AL-6619 and AL-6629 in the Val135 canyon disfavors an endo-sulfonamide configuration that would simultaneously place its aromatic substituent in this narrow canyon (Figure 2). Because the structure of AL-8520 differs from that of AL-4862 (brinzolamide) by just a single N-ethyl substituent (Table 1), it is useful to summarize the binding mode of the CAII-AL-4862 complex.18 The exosulfonamide and endo-sulfonamide groups of AL-4862 make interactions with the enzyme active site identical to those of AL-6619, AL-6629, and AL-8520. The aliphatic ether tail contacts Phe-131, Val-135, and Pro202, and the ethylamine NH group donates a hydrogen bond to Thr-200. Importantly, the ethylamine group sterically forces His-64 to adopt the out conformation. Computationally Predicted Structures of CAIVInhibitor Complexes. The structures of AL-6619, AL6629, AL-8520, and AL-4862 complexed with CAIV were predicted by three-dimensional structural alignment;

Electrostatic surface potentials were generated by GRASP.31

i.e., each CAII-inhibitor crystal structure was superimposed onto CAIV and then the energy of the respective CAIV-inhibitor complex was minimized as summarized in the Experimental Section. Given the observed conformational mobility of His-64 in CAII and given the apparent impact of this mobility on inhibitor binding affinity, two different CAIV conformers, CAIV-His-64in and CAIV-His-64out, were used in energy minimizations. Both His-64 conformers yielded similar predicted structures of CAIV-inhibitor complexes for all inhibitors except for AL-4862 (Figure 3). Just as the ethylamino group of AL-4862 sterically requires the conformational change of His-64 to accommodate binding to CAII, it is reasonable to expect the same requirement to accommodate binding to CAIV. The predicted binding modes of the exo-sulfonamide and the adjacent bicyclic ring structures are identical for each inhibitor and resemble those observed in the corresponding, experimentally determined CAII-inhibitor complexes: the ionized sulfonamide NH group coordinates to zinc and donates a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl side chain of Thr-199, and a sulfonamide Sd O group accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone NH group of Thr-199. An endo-sulfonamide oxygen atom of each inhibitor accepts a hydrogen bond from Gln-92 in

Discussion The main objective of this study is the determination of the structural basis of isozyme selectivity for inhibitor binding to CAII and CAIV. Crystal structures of CAIIinhibitor complexes are compared with predicted structures of CAIV-inhibitor complexes in Figures 2 and 4. In CAII, two "canyons" at the mouth of the hydrophobic cleft accommodate inhibitor pendant tail groups: the Val-135 canyon is flanked by Pro-202 and Phe-131, and the Ile-91 canyon is flanked by Phe-131 and Asn-67. The morpholino (AL-6619 and AL-6629) and aliphatic ether (AL-8520) tail groups occupy the Val-135 canyon, while the meta-substituted phenyl rings (AL-6619 and AL6629) occupy the Ile-91 canyon. Because AL-6619, AL6629, and AL-8520 exhibit similar IC50 values (Table 1), the contribution of the tail groups to the overall binding affinity must be similar for all three cases. All four X-ray crystal structures of the CAII-inhibitor complexes reveal that His-64 adopts the out conformation, although AL-4862 is the only inhibitor in this series to sterically require the conformational change of His-64 for binding. Because AL-6619, AL-6629, and AL-8520 do not sterically force His-64 to move from the native in conformation to the observed out conformation, His-64 movement may instead arise from other subtle conformational and solvation changes in the protein tertiary structure triggered by inhibitor binding. CAIV docking simulations similarly show that the binding of AL-4862 is sensitive to the His-64 conformation, whereas the binding of AL-6619, AL-6629, and AL8520 is independent of the His-64 conformation. AL4862 is anchored to the enzyme by the exo-sulfonamidezinc interaction and by a hydrogen bond between the endo-sulfonamide and the Gln-92. The absence of strong anchoring interactions for the inhibitor aliphatic ether tail and the conformational mobility of the 130's segment in the CAIV active site that potentially destabilizes inhibitor binding likely result in the 14-fold lower affinity of AL-4862 toward CAIV as compared with CAII (Table 1). As compared to that of CAII, the hydrophobic cleft of CAIV has a less constricted contour due to the Lys-124Glu-138 loop that extends away from the active site. CAIV contains no canyon corresponding to the Ile-91 canyon of CAII, and the canyon corresponding to the Val-135 canyon of CAII is much broader (Figure 2). This broad canyon in CAIV accommodates the morpholino (AL-6619 and AL-6629) and aliphatic ether (AL-8520

the predicted models of their complexes with CAIV. The pendant tail groups of AL-6619 and AL-6629 make identical interactions in the CAIV active site: the metasubstituted phenyl ring of each inhibitor contacts Gln92, and the morpholino group is positioned adjacent to the wall of the active site lined by Thr-202, Asp-204, and Lys-206. The aliphatic ether tail of AL-8520 is positioned similarly to the morpholino groups of AL6619 and AL-6629, i.e., adjacent to the surface lined by residues Thr-202 and Asp-204; the ether oxygen atom makes no hydrogen bond interactions. Likewise, the primary amine group of AL-8520 makes no hydrogen bond interactions, although its proximity to the side chain of Thr-200 and the presence of water suggest at least a potential for hydrogen bond interactions. Finally, the aliphatic ether tail of AL-4862 is similarly positioned to that of AL-8520, and the ethylamine group lies adjacent to the enzyme surface lined by Trp-5 and Thr200; the ethylamine NH group makes no hydrogen bond interactions.

and AL-4862) tail groups of inhibitors. The relatively bulky morpholino and meta-substituted phenyl groups of AL-6619 and AL-6629 provide for more extensive contact surface area than the narrow aliphatic ether tail groups of AL-8520 or AL-4862 with the broad canyon in CAIV. This phenomenon may rationalize the CAIVinhibitor affinity trends observed in Table 1, i.e., that nanomolar affinity toward CAIV is maintained by AL6619 and AL-6629. We speculate that an inhibitor with a sufficiently bulky tail may bind preferentially to CAIV, since such a large tail group will not fit in the relatively constricted Val-135 canyon of CAII. The binding of AL-4862 (brinzolamide) is of particular interest because it is currently formulated for glaucoma therapy as Azopt. The X-ray crystal structures of the human CAII-brinzolamide and the murine CAIVbrinzolamide complexes have been reported.18 In Figure 4, we compare these experimentally determined structures with the computationally predicted structure of the human CAIV-brinzolamide complex. Note that the mouth of the cleft is markedly different in each of the three isozymes. Human CAII contains a three-turn R-helix (containing Phe-131) that divides the Ile-91 and Val-135 canyons. In human and murine CAIV, this polypeptide segment is either disordered or adopts an extended loop conformation, which results in a single, much broader canyon instead of two smaller canyons. Consequently, brinzolamide binds differently in each case. As with other inhibitors investigated in this study, the binding conformation of brinzolamide is highly complementary to the contour of the human CAII active site, whereas brinzolamide fits more "loosely" in the human CAIV and murine CAIV active sites (Figure 4). The lack of a narrow canyon corresponding to the Val135 canyon of CAII appears to be responsible for the loss of inhibitor affinity to CAIV. Moreover, the conformational mobility of this polypeptide segment in human and murine CAIVs may additionally compromise inhibitor binding affinity. Conclusions A combination of X-ray crystallographic and computational methods are used together to understand the structural basis of inhibitor affinity variations in binding to CAII and CAIV. Although three-dimensional

structural alignment and energy minimization prove to be an effective tool in this study, we note that in more general applications special care must always be exercised to account for possible conformational changes of the protein receptor. In the case of CAII-inhibitor and CAIV-inhibitor complexes, the prediction problem is simplified because apart from the conformational mobility of His-64, these enzymes are essentially static receptors. Accordingly, comparisons of the experimentally determined structures of CAII-inhibitor complexes and computationally predicted structures of CAIVinhibitor complexes reveal the molecular basis for inhibitor affinity variations between the two isozymes. Experimental Section
CAII Crystallography. Human CAII was crystallized in 2.60-2.75 M ammonium sulfate and 50 mM Tris-sulfate (pH 8.0) at 4 °C using the hanging drop method. The protein solution contained 8-12 mg/mL CAII, 1 mM methyl mercuric acetate, and 50 mM Tris-sulfate (pH 8.0). Crystals appeared within 1 week and grew to full size in 2 weeks. Prior to inhibitor soaking, CAII crystals were cross-linked by adding 5 µL of glutaraldehyde solution (0.8% glutaraldehyde (v/v), 4.0 M ammonium sulfate, and 50 mM Tris-sulfate (pH 8.0)) to the hanging drop and allowing it to equilibrate at 4 °C for 72 h. Each cross-linked crystal was transferred to a 10 µL drop containing a stabilization buffer of 3.5 M ammonium sulfate and 50 mM Tris-sulfate (pH 8.0). One microliter of inhibitor solution (10 mM inhibitor dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to this drop and allowed to equilibrate at 4 °C for 1 week. Crystals of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes were mounted in 0.7 mm glass capillaries. The X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature using an R-AXIS IIc image plate detector (Molecular Structure Corporation) with a Rigaku RU200HB rotating anode generator (operating at 50 kV and 100 mA) supplying Cu KR radiation focused with Yale double mirrors. The raw diffraction data were processed using the HKL suite of programs.26 Crystals of enzyme-inhibitor complexes were isomorphous with those of native CAII, belonging to space group P21 with typical unit cell parameters a ) 42.7 Å, b ) 41.4 Å, c ) 72.9 Å, and ) 104.5°. The 1.54 Å resolution structure of native human CAII retrieved from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB accession code, 2CBA) was used as the starting coordinate set for the refinement of each enzyme-inhibitor complex structure.21 Electron density maps, calculated with Fourier coefficients 2|Fo| - |Fc| and |Fo| - |Fc|, and phases derived from the inprogress atomic model were generated with X-PLOR.27 The

Carbonic Anhydrases II and IV inhibitor and solvent molecules in the active site were modeled in when the R factor dropped below 0.25; the graphics software O was used for map fitting and model building.28 Refinement converged smoothly to final crystallographic R factors within the range of 0.165-0.198. Data refinement and collection statistics are recorded in Table 2. Coordinates of all enzymeinhibitor complexes have been deposited in the RCSB with accession codes designated in Table 2. CAIV Modeling. Three-dimensional structural alignment was utilized to predict the structure of each CAIV-inhibitor complex using the experimentally determined structure of the corresponding CAII-inhibitor complex as a starting point. The 2.8 Å resolution X-ray structure of the human CAIV-sulfate complex (RCSB accession code 1ZNC)17 was used for structure alignment experiments. There are two molecules of CAIV in the asymmetric unit, designated A and B. The two chains have similar structural features (rms deviation ) 0.2 Å) except in the Lys-124-Glu-138 region: in chain A, this segment is wellordered and forms an extended loop while in chain B, this segment is disordered and thus absent from the final model. The atomic coordinates of chain A, less sulfate, Hg2+, and water molecules were used for modeling experiments. Inhibitor molecules were placed in the CAIV active site by overlaying the CAII-inhibitor structures onto the CAIV structure using 23 conserved residues that lined the active site cleft (rms deviation  0.9 Å). The energies of CAIV-inhibitor structures were then minimized as a function of atomic coordinate positions using the conjugate gradient energy minimization routine in the program CNS; standard protein topology and parameter files were employed.29 Topology and parameter files for the inhibitors were constructed by using XPLO2D30 and edited appropriately. To mimic the known primary binding interactions of the aromatic sulfonamides with CA, constraints on the exo-sulfonamide nitrogen-zinc bond and the exo-sulfonamide oxygen-Thr-199 backbone amide hydrogen bond were imposed during energy minimization. The remainder of each inhibitor molecule was free to seek the minimum energy location and conformation within the CAIV active site cleft.
