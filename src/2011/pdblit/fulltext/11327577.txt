Abstract--A novel series of anthranilic acid-based inhibitors of MMP-1, MMP-9, MMP-13, and TACE was prepared and evaluated. Selective inhibitors of MMP-9, MMP-13, and TACE were identified, including the potent, orally active MMP-13 inhibitor 4p. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including collagenases, stromelysins, gelatinases, and membrane-type MMPs, comprise a group of over 20 zinc-containing enzymes that play a role in the normal remodeling and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins. The potential exists for potent, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitors of MMPs to treat a broad spectrum of pathologies, including atherosclerosis,1 rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,2 and cancer,3 in which the aberrant control of MMP levels has been implicated as a causative factor. For example, the nonpeptide sulfonamide hydroxamate CGS-27023A has been in oncology clinical trials (Fig. 1). We have recently disclosed a novel series of sulfonamide hydroxamic acid inhibitors of MMP-1, MMP-9, MMP13, and TACE (TNF-a converting enzyme), based on an anthranilic acid scaffold.4 The SAR of the anthranilic acid 3-position leading to compounds exemplified by 1 (Fig. 1), with nanomolar level in vitro activity, and oral bioavailability, has been discussed. We now wish to report the MMP/TACE SARs for variations at the phenylsulfonyl P11 moiety (4, R1), as well as the anthranilic acid 5-position (4, R5). Compounds

selective for MMP-9, MMP-13, or TACE have been obtained by the judicious choice of substituents at these two key locations.

Chemistry In general, the desired sulfonamide hydroxamic acids were prepared as previously described (Scheme 1).4,5 Variants at R5 of hydroxamic acid 4 were prepared by starting with the appropriately substituted anthranilic acid, 2, or via derivatization of the 5-bromo-sulfona-

mide-ester 3a (R1=OMe; R2=Bn or CH2-3-Py; R3=Me; R4=Me; R5=Br). Thus, Suzuki couplings of 3a with aryl boronic acids provided compounds 4c­e after conversion of the ester into the requisite hydroxamate. The 5-diethylaminomethyl analogue, 4f, was prepared via Stille coupling of 3b (R1=OMe; R2=H; R3=Me; R4=Me; R5=Br) with tributyl(vinyl)tin to give olefin 3c, followed by benzylation of the NH­sulfonamide, OsO4/NaIO4 oxidation of the olefin, reductive amination of the resulting aldehyde and hydroxamic acid formation. The N,N-dimethylaniline 4g was prepared via Buchwald coupling of 3a with tris(dimethylamino)borane.6 Similarly, coupling of 3d (R1=OMe; R2=H; R3=Br; R4=Me; R5=Me) with phenylboronic acid and 2-furanboronic acid led to 4h and 4i, analogues at the anthranilate 3-position.

Alkoxy P11 derivatives 4j­4m, 4v­4y, and thioether 4r were available via fluoride displacement from a 4-fluorophenyl sulfonamide, 3e (R1=F; R2=Me, Bn or CH2-3Py; R3=Me; R4=H, Me or Bn; R5=Me or Br), with the appropriate alcohol or thiol and NaH/DMF, or from the phenol 3f (R1=OH; R2=Bn; R3=Me; R4=Me; R5=Br) via a Mitsunobu alkylation (4u). Biaryl P11 groups were introduced from the 4-bromophenyl sulfonamide 3g (R1=Br; R2=CH2-3-Py; R3=Me; R4=Me; R5=H) using Suzuki couplings (4s­4t). Biaryl ethers were prepared from the requisite biaryl sulfonyl chloride (4p­4q), or via aryl ether formation (4n­4o) according to the method of Chan from phenol 3f.7

Biology All of the anthranilate hydroxamic acids were tested in vitro8 for their ability to inhibit MMP-1, MMP-9, MMP-13, and TACE9 (Table 1). Inhibitors of MMP-9 are potentially valuable as inhibitors of tumor metastasis,3 while MMP-13 inhibitors may offer protection from the cartilage degradation associated with osteoarthritis.2 Inhibitors of TACE are potentially valuable for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and other inflammatory diseases.10 Selectivity for MMP-9 or MMP-13 or TACE over MMP-1 was sought in order to examine whether the inhibition of MMP-1 is

a possible source of the musculoskeletal side effects seen in clinical trials of broad spectrum MMP inhibitors.11 The in vitro potencies against the MMPs and TACE for a series of anthranilate hydroxamic acid analogues, 4a­ 4i, in which substitution at the 5-position of the anthranilate phenyl ring was explored are shown in Table 1. All of these compounds, with the exception of analogue 4f, are potent inhibitors of both MMP-9 and MMP-13, comparable to the 5-unsubstituted derivative 1. Aryl or heteroaryl groups at the anthranilate 3- (4h and 4i) or 5-positions (4c­4e) provide excellent activity versus MMP-13. Furthermore, the 5-aryl compounds, 4c­4e, display high levels of selectivity over MMP-1, from almost 50- to over 700-fold. Interestingly, incorporating basic alkylamino substituents at the 5-position, as in diethylaminomethyl derivative 4f and dimethylaniline 4g, results in compounds that are potent against MMP-9 and selective over MMP-1 and MMP-13. TACE activity is also affected by the choice of the anthranilate 5-substituent. Thus, the 5-bromo derivative 4a is 5 times more potent against TACE than the 5unsubstituted parent, 1. Although a 5-bromo substituent (4a) provided the greatest TACE potency in the series 4a­ 4i, all of the 5-substituents in this series which were not excessively bulky (4d and 4e) or basic (4f and 4g) had enhanced TACE activity relative to compound 1. Unfortunately, despite their potency against isolated enzyme, compounds 4a­4i did not display significant TNF-a inhibitory activity in a THP-1 cellular assay at 3 mM.12 Variations of the P11 substituent of the anthranilate hydroxamic acids are shown for compounds 4j­4y in Table 1. NMR studies have shown that the R1 group of compound 4 occupies the S11 pocket of MMP-13.13 Lengthening of P11 alkoxy moieties (4j­4l) results in a loss of MMP-1 activity, as expected from the shallow nature of the S11 pocket of this enzyme. However, MMP-9 and MMP-13 activity for 4k and benzyl ether 4l also diminish beyond useful levels. Inserting an additional methylene spacer in 4l leads to the phenethyl analogue 4m and restores some MMP-9 and MMP-13 activity. On the other hand, the more rigid P11 biaryl ethers, 4n­4q, and thioether 4r retain or improve their potency against MMP-9 and MMP-13 relative to methyl ether 1. Surprisingly, comparison of the neutral phenyl ethers, 4n and 4o, shows that a bulky para-substituent is required for these to realize greater than 100-fold selectivity over MMP-1. It is possible that the arginine residue that normally forms the bottom of the MMP-1 S11 pocket is pushed aside to some degree by the P11 biphenyl ether substituent of 4n, extending the depth of the pocket. Thioether 4r and the more polar 4-pyridyl ethers, 4p and 4q, do not need additional substitution and are among the most selective members of the series (> 250-fold). It is important to note that compound 4q, with its lengthy P11 moiety, no longer requires the 3-substituent on the anthranilate ring (R3=H) that our initial series needed to attain acceptable potency.4 The biaryl derivatives 4s and 4t are also potent and selective MMP-13 inhibitors, with 4t possessing over 300- and 35-fold selectivity over MMP-1 and MMP-9, respectively.

Although benzyl ether 4l was only a weakly active TACE inhibitor, it was the first member of this series that was more potent against TACE than against MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-13. The optimization of this lead into a potent and selective TACE inhibitor is represented with compounds 4u­4y. The 5-bromo analogue 4u provides a slight increase in TACE potency over 4l and substantially improves selectivity for TACE. Next, a 5-fold increase in potency was realized in going from N-benzyl analogue 4u to the corresponding Nmethyl sulfonamide 4v. Replacement of the terminal phenyl ring of 4v with a 3-thienyl group (4w) offered no improvement. Thiazole analogue 4x, however, is over twice as potent as 4v and is approximately 400-, 40-, and 30-fold selective over MMP-1, MMP-9, and MMP-13, respectively. Still greater TACE selectivity is obtained with 3-picolyl ether 4y, while the analogous 2- and 4-picolyl derivatives (not shown) displayed a 6- to 8-fold diminution of TACE activity. Examination of the X-ray structure of TACE suggests that the terminal phenyl or heteroaryl ring of 4u­4y is positioned in the channel connecting the S11 and S31 pockets.14 The TNF-a inhibitory activity of compounds 4u­4y in a THP-1 cellular assay was disappointingly poor, however. Thiophene 4w was the most potent derivative in cells, affording only 22% inhibition of TNF-a at 3 mM. The in vivo bioactivity against MMP-13 for some of the anthranilate-hydroxamates (4c­4e, 4h­4i, and 4p­4t) after oral dosing was assessed through the use of a dialysis tubing implant assay.15 All of the compounds tested were compared to Novartis' sulfonamidehydroxamate clinical lead, CGS-27023A,16 in the same experiment. Despite the fact that the compounds tested had in vitro potencies comparable to CGS-27023A against MMP-13, only 4h was as potent as CGS-27023A in vivo. Compounds 4c, 4e, 4p, and 4r were approximately 80% as potent CGS-27023A. Anthranilate-hydroxamates 4c, 4e, and 4p were also tested side by side with CGS-27023A in a bovine articular cartilage explant assay.17 At a concentration of 1 mM, compound 4e provided a level of inhibition of cartilage degradation slightly superior to CGS-27023A (4e: 83%/CGS-27023A: 70%, n=2). Compounds 4c and 4p were roughly equivalent to CGS-27023A at 1 mM in this assay. Hydroxamates 4c, 4e, and 4p were then evaluated in an in vivo rat sponge-wrapped cartilage model.18 Only pyridyl ether 4p demonstrated significant inhibition of collagen degradation in this model. Oral dosing at 50 mg/kg/bid provided a 35% inhibition (n=2) of collagen degradation compared to a 51% inhibition by CGS-27023A at the same dose. In conclusion, we have expanded upon our initial series of anthranilate-hydroxamic acid MMP inhibitors. We have found that through the proper choice of

substituents, these compounds can be manipulated to provide potent and selective inhibitors of MMP-9 or MMP-13 or TACE. The best MMP-13 inhibitors of the series were evaluated in vitro and in vivo to assess their potential for treating osteoarthritis. Compounds 4c, 4e, and 4p are active in an in vitro cartilage degradation assay and display oral activity in an in vivo mouse bioactivity model. Pyridyl ether 4p, a potent MMP-9 and MMP-13 inhibitor with greater than 800-fold selectivity over MMP-1, has also demonstrated oral activity in a rat sponge-wrapped cartilage model. The further exploration of the SAR of these novel MMP inhibitors will be reported in due course.
