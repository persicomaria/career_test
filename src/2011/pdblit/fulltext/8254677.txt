The hydrophobic core packing in four-a-helical bundles appears to be crucial for stabilizing the protein structure. To examine the structural basis of hydrophobic stabilization, the crystal structures of the Leu 3 Val (L41V) and Leu 3 Ala (L41A) substitutions of the core residue Leu41 of the ROP protein have been determined. Both substitutions are destabilizing and lead to formation of cavities. The main responses to mutations are the collapse of the central part of the a-helix containing the site of mutation, shifts of internal water molecules, and in L41A, the trapping of a water molecule in a cavity engineered by the mutation. For both Ê mutants, these effects limit the increase in cavity size to less than 10 A3, Ê Ê while an increase of 37 A3 and 100 A3 is expected for L41V and L41A, respectively, in the absence of any cavity size reducing effects. The mobility of internal side-chains is increased and in L41A, it reaches values typical for exposed residues. A parameter (Ánh) is introduced as a measure of the number of van der Waals contacts lost. For ROP, barnase and T4 lysozyme mutants, there is a good correlation between Ánh and the free energy of unfolding ÁÁG relative to wild-type protein. The Ánh value turns out to be more suitable for analysing structural and energetic responses to mutation than other parameter, such as cavity volumes and packing densities. Possible evolutionary implications of the ÁÁG versus Ánh relationship are discussed.

Introduction
Globular proteins are characterized by wellpacked hydrophobic cores which play important roles in protein folding and stability (Bernal, 1994; Dill, 1990). Understanding the contribution of individual hydrophobic residues to the free energy of proteins is a non-trivial problem, which in several cases has been approached by analyses of energetic and structural changes induced by mutations. Considerable experimental work has been performed on large-to-small side-chain substitutions (e.g. Leu 3 Ala) in protein cores. The responses to such mutations are complex and show no uniform pattern. In most cases they lead to cavity formation, an effect which is often accompanied by structural changes which partially or completely re®ll cavities (Xu et al., 1994). Occasionally, water molecules are included into these cavities (Buckle et al., 1996).

The correlation between structural responses and stability changes resulting from large-to-small substitutions in protein cores is not well understood. Based on mutations in the core of phage T4 lysozyme, a correlation has been proposed (Xu et al., 1994; Eriksson et al., 1992) between ÁÁG, the difference in the free energy of unfolding between mutant and wild-type protein, and the size of the cavity created. The loss of mutant stability was separated into two terms: a constant term speci®c for a given type of substitutions (e.g. Leu 3 Ala) that should be comparable with the difference in the free energies of transfer from solvent to the protein core of the original and of the new amino acid. The second term corresponds with the energy cost of forming a cavity and has a value of Ê approximately 22 cal molÀ1 AÀ3. A linear relationship between ÁÁG and cavity volume has been con®rmed roughly for some proteins (Buckle et al., 1996; Takano et al., 1995), but it is not always valid (Buckle et al., 1993). A serious problem originates from the calculation of cavity size. The numerical

Other attempts to correlate structural changes and mutant stability include the establishment of an approximately linear relationship between ÁÁG and the sum of the shifts of atomic positions in the Ê mutant structure within a 6 A radius range of the site of mutation (Ile/Leu 3 Ala substitutions in the core of barnase; Buckle et al., 1996). In a subset of chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 mutants, Fersht and co-workers found an excellent correlation between ÁÁG and the packing density of the methyl and Ê methylene groups within 6 A of the removed atoms (Otzen et al., 1995). These relationships cannot be generalized, as they are not supported by the studies on other proteins (Xu et al., 1998). The energetics of hydrophobic cores have also been studied by small-to-large substitutions. Occasionally stabilization has been reported, although sterical strain may be introduced by the large side-chain in the mutant structure (Lim et al., 1994; Akasako et al., 1997). Such substitutions will be not discussed in this paper. Despite the complexity of the ®eld, a better understanding of the energetics of protein core mutations has potential applications in protein engineering, and may also have evolutionary implications since it may help de®ne constraints to the evolution of new core sequences (Lim et al., 1994; Bordo & Argos, 1990). The small homodimeric ROP protein provides an attractive system to examine structural and thermodynamic responses to core mutations. The structure of ROP is known both in the crystal form (Banner et al., 1987) and in solution (Eberle et al., 1991). The dimer forms a four-a-helical bundle. Studies of the wild-type (Steif el al., 1995) and mutant (Vlassi et al., 1994) protein have established that folding and stability are largely determined by a regular pattern of hydrophobic core interactions. Other interactions, e.g. those occurring in the bend region, play a rather marginal role. Similarly to other a-helical coiled-coils, the amino acid sequence of ROP is characterized by a speci®c pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. The residues in this pattern can be conveniently speci®ed by the heptad repeat nomenclature, typically used for associating helices (Cohen & Parry, 1986). A statistical analysis of heptad positions, revealed that in four-a-helical bundles, including ROP, the hydrophobic core positions have a pronounced preference for Leu or Ala (Paliakasis & Kokkinidis, 1992). Here, we present a study of amino acid substitutions of the core residue Leu41. We are seeking to understand the structural responses of ROP to substitutions of a Leu residue which statistically is the most favored for the particular core position (Paliakasis & Kokkinidis, 1992), by smaller residues (Val, Ala), and to correlate these responses with the observed loss of protein stability (Steif et al.,

1995). Interestingly, the most unstable mutant is the replacement Leu 3 Ala; this substitution involves two amino acid residues with the highest propensity of occurrence in four-a-helical bundle cores (Paliakasis & Kokkinidis, 1992). ROP variants with redesigned cores consisting exclusively of Leu and Ala are more thermally stable than the wildtype protein (Munson et al., 1994, 1996). The site of mutation, Leu41, belongs to the second a-helix of ROP. Its side-chain is entirely buried in the central part of the hydrophobic core of the bundle. In the crystal structure of the ROP dimer, the two Leu41 residues are related to each other by an exact dyad (Figure 1). Their side-chains are positioned at both ends of a cavity which is formed in the center of the core. A second cavity is also present near the ®rst one (Figure 2). Two symmetry-related water molecules are buried inside the core (Figure 1). Each water molecule is associated with one ROP monomer, being hydrogen bonded to main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms.

Results and Discussion
The mutant proteins undergo structural changes close to the site of mutation There are no signi®cant differences in overall folding between wild-type ROP (Figure 1) and its mutants: the three proteins form highly regular four-a-helical bundles. The mutants exhibit a pattern of three cavities in their cores; these cavities are partially conserved from wild-type ROP and partially result from the mutations (Figure 2). After spatial superposition (at monomer level) of the helical parts of wild-type ROP with each of the mutants, the rms deviation in 54 Ca positions is Ê Ê 0.29 A for L41A and 0.41 A for L41V. If the helical parts of the dimers (108 Ca positions) are superimÊ posed, the rms deviations are bigger (0.38 A for Ê L41A and 0.46 A for L41V), indicating that the four-a-helical bundles of the mutants are slightly deformed relative to wild-type ROP. The overall differences between wild-type protein and the

mutant structures are thus small, in agreement with earlier reports where the dif®culties in distinguishing between structural changes and errors due to limitations of the data were discussed (Lim et al., 1994). Fortunately, most structural changes that appear to be signi®cant, occur systematically in both mutants and are thus likely to be real. The rms differences in the ®rst helix which is less affected by the mutation between wild-type ROP Ê and the mutants, is of the order of 0.2 A; this can be taken as a measure of the accuracy of the coordinates. All structural changes discussed in the paper exceed this value. The most signi®cant changes occur in the second helix, largely within a Ê zone approximately 6 A from the site of mutation. The main structural response is a slight bending of the second helix towards the cavity created by the mutation (Figure 3(a) and (b)). The rms discrepancy between mutant and wild-type structure for Ê the second helix is of the order of 0.4 A. In both mutants, there are almost no changes in side-chain conformations of core residues. The w1 rotamer of the native Leu41 is conserved when Val is introduced in L41V. This rotamer is a major one for Val and Leu (Schrauber et al., 1993). The only signi®cant side-chain changes close to the site of

mutation occur at two semi-buried His residues (His42, His44) which are not part of the core. Other side-chain changes occur in some solvent exposed residues; it is unlikely that they are linked with the mutation. The water molecules present in the hydrophobic core of wild-type ROP are conserved in both mutants apart from some minor shifts in position. Because of the space created by the mutation, an additional water molecule is trapped in the center of the hydrophobic core of L41A. This water is clearly detectable in 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc electron density maps, and is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the two symmetry-related mutated residues. The B-factor of the additional Ê water has a value of 29 A2, which is an intermediÊ ate between the average values of 20 A2 for protein Ê atoms and 41 A2 for water molecules. The position of this water molecule in the center of the core splits a large cavity into two smaller ones (Figure 2). In the absence of this water molecule, the cavity would occupy a considerable part of the protein interior. The original large cavity would have resulted from the enlargement of a cavity already present in wild-type ROP. This enlarge-

820 ment arises from the truncation of the Leu41 sidechains lining its ends. The increase in total cavity volume is approximately the same for both mutants The most striking feature with both ROP variants is a tendency to drastically reduce the size of the cavities formed. Taking into account that the Ê total cavity volume in wild-type ROP is 68.5 A3, and assuming the absence of any cavity size reducing effects, an additional cavity volume of Ê Ê approximately 37 A3 and 100 A3 is expected for L41V and the L41A, respectively. In both cases, however, the actual increase in cavity volume is Ê less than 10 A3 (Table 1). There are two effects contributing to this reduction of cavity size. The ®rst effect is the bending of the second ROP helix. The second effect is movement of internal water molecules. In L41V the two internal water molecules shift (Figure 3) towards the site of the mutation and partially ®ll the cavity created. Ê Each water molecule moves more than 0.6 A inside the core relative to its position in wildtype ROP. In L41A, these water molecules move

Ê approximately 0.4 A towards the cavity. In L41A, a further cavity size reducing effect comes from the additional water molecule trapped in the middle of the core. Changes in the mobility of core side-chains are observed In wild-type ROP (Figure 4) and in L41V, the variation of the averaged temperature factors B along the sequence re¯ects the a-helical periodicity of the protein; core residues have lower mobility than those on the outside. This periodicity partially breaks down in L41A (Figure 4). The diminished periodicity of B in L41A is more pronounced for residues near the mutation site, i.e. core residues 15 and 19 on the ®rst helix and residue 45 on the second helix. The B values in L41A re¯ect a sharp rise in the mobility of core residues. The maximum rise occurs in the ®rst helix, around residues Ile15 and Thr19, which in the dimer are packed against the site of mutation. The mobilities of these core residues in L41A are comparable with those of exposed residues.

Comparison to other proteins Comparable mutational analyses have been carried out for other proteins. Some of the structural responses reported are also found in L41A and L41V, although in several aspects ROP appears to be rather idiosyncratic. A partial collapse of cavities has been reported, inter alia, for barnase (Buckle et al., 1996), T4 lysozyme (Xu et al., 1998; Eriksson et al., 1992) and human lysozyme (Takano et al., 1995, 1997). The structural changes which partially re®ll cavities are mostly shifts or rotations of side-chains surrounding the site of mutation (Xu et al., 1998; Buckle et al., 1996). In contrast, ROP does not alter the conformation of side-chains surrounding the cavities; cavity-size reduction in ROP results from the bending of the second helix and from the movement of internal water molecules. Comparable effects in other proteins are rare; changes involving a deformation of a secondary structure element as a whole have been reported for T4 lysozyme (collapse of a loop towards the site of mutation in Ile29Ala; Xu et al., 1998) and deformation of helices for various single or double mutants (Baldwin et al., 1996). Inclusions of water molecules in cavities engineered by mutations similar to those with L41A have been reported for barnase (Buckle et al., 1996), T4 lysozyme (Xu et al., 1998) and human lysozyme (Takano et al., 1995, 1997). An unusual feature of L41A is the sharp rise of temperature factors of core residues.

Relationship between cavity volume changes and Á Á G As described in the Introduction, the linear relationship found in T4 lysozyme (Xu et al., 1998; Eriksson et al., 1992) between ÁÁG and the increase in total cavity volume, ÁV, has led to a description of the overall loss of stability as a sum of two terms. The ®rst term is constant for a given class of substitutions and can be considered for the Leu 3 Ala mutations, for example, as the difference between the free energy of transfer from solvent to the protein core of Leu and Ala residues. The second term is the cost of creating a cavity of volume ÁV and has a value of approximately Ê 22 cal molÀ1 AÀ3. This ÁÁG versus ÁV relationship is partially con®rmed in some cases (Buckle et al., 1996; Takano et al., 1995), while data from other studies (Buckle et al., 1993) do not support it. Figure 5 shows a graph of ÁÁG versus ÁV for L41V and L41A along with barnase and T4 lysozyme mutants of the types Leu/Ile 3 Ala and Leu 3 Val. Because of the different methods used to identify cavities and to compute their sizes, the values found in the literature were not directly comparable. Accordingly, the cavity volumes for all mutants were recalculated as described in Materials and Methods (Table 1). It can be seen from Figure 5 that the data points for each type of mutation do not always ®t well to the linear relationship proposed by Xu et al. (1998) and by Eriksson et al. (1992). The least-squares lines (not

shown in Figure 5) through the data points of each group of mutations listed in Table 1, yield completely different parameters for the relationship between ÁÁG and ÁV than the values given by Xu et al. (1998). Certainly, the most critical factor in determining this relationship is the calculation of cavity size, which unfortunately is highly dependent on the algorithm and on the parameters used. Because of the decidedly non-trivial calculations involved, cavity volumes are probably not very well suited to the establishment of a relationship between protein stability and structural changes induced by mutation. The loss of residue contacts parameter Á nh is strongly correlated to the loss of stability Structural responses to mutation can be also quanti®ed with parameters other than cavity volumes. Parameter Ánh, introduced in Materials and Methods, is a measure of the decrease in packing interactions and is sensitive to structural changes in the core. Compared with ÁV, it can be calculated in a more straightforward manner. Esti-

mates of Ánh are summarized in Table 1. Good linear relationships (with correlation coef®cients around 0.9) exist between ÁÁG and Ánh for the three types of mutations (Leu 3 Ala, Ile 3 Ala and Leu 3 Val); these gave the parameters listed in Table 2. Graphical representations are shown in Figure 6. The least-squares line (Figure 6) through the data for the Leu 3 Ala substitutions (assuming equal weights for data points) has an intercept of À2.65 kcal molÀ1 and a slope of 0.17 kcal molÀ1 contactÀ1. The Ile 3 Ala and Leu 3 Val substitutions have approximately the same slope. Because the Leu 3 Ala set of mutants includes the largest number of observations and spans the greatest range of ÁÁG and Ánh, we have used the value of 0.17 kcal molÀ1 contactÀ1 as the slope for the other two sets of mutants too. A similar approach was also used by Xu et al. (1998) for the ÁÁG versus ÁV correlation. For each group of mutations, the intercept of the line obtained from the ÁÁG versus Ánh relationship with the ÁÁG axis, is a constant term which depends only on the nature of the side-chains. Thus, this term is probably related to the hydro-

phobic effect (Bernal, 1939; Kauzmann, 1959). A similar interpretation was given to the intercepts of the lines derived from the ÁÁG versus ÁV relationship (Xu et al., 1998; Eriksson et al., 1992). The slope of the ÁÁG versus Ánh line can be considered as the energy cost per contact lost. From the de®nition of nh, it follows that the energy cost varies, depending on the speci®c contact. According to this de®nition, loss of contacts made with buried residues close to the site of mutation has the largest impact on stability. Furthermore, if new interactions are gained from the collapse of a cavity, these interactions should restore some of the lost stabilization of the mutant. The extrapolated intercept of the ÁÁG versus Ánh line (Figure 6) for the Leu 3 Ala mutants, should correspond, as a ®rst approximation, to the difference in the free energies of transfer of Leu and Ala from solvent to the protein core. The numerical value of the intercept for Leu 3 Ala mutations should be comparable with the difference in the free energies of transfer of Leu and Ala from water to octanol (Table 2). Similar relationships should hold for other types of mutations. The discrepancies of the extrapolated intercepts of the three lines in Figure 6 from water-to-octanol transfer free energies (Fauchere & Pliska, 1983) are of the order of 25 % (Table 2). One likely reason for these discrepancies is the limited number of data points. Furthermore, other scales than the water-tooctanol transfer free energies (Fauchere & Pliska, 1983) could have been used as reference. An interesting implication of the relationship between ÁÁG and Ánh is obtained if ÁÁG is graphed against the per cent change of contacts relative to the wild-type protein calculated as Ánh/nh,wt (Figure 7). Although the number of data points is very small, they obviously form clusters; these

clusters re¯ect the difference in size between the wild-type and the mutant side-chain. This is a straight forward conclusion from the de®nition of nh, since it is the difference in side-chain size between wild-type and mutant protein that mainly determines the fraction of contacts lost on mutation. For example, the contact loss in Leu 3 Val mutants, with a change in side-chain size equal to one methyl group, is 20-40 % and the average value of ÁÁG is À1.0 kcal molÀ1. In Leu/Ile 3 Ala mutants, much larger differences in side-chain size are involved; these are associated with the loss of a larger fraction of contacts and with a more drastic reduction of protein stabilities. For the Leu/Ile 3 Ala mutants listed in Table 1, ÁÁG is generally better correlated with Ánh than with other structural parameters, such as the change of cavity volume ÁV (Xu et al., 1998) or packing density (Otzen et al., 1995), which have been used in earlier studies for the prediction of mutant stabilities. Leu 3 Val mutants were not used in this comparison because their number is too small for a sensible analysis. The correlation coef®cients for the ÁÁG versus Ánh relationship (Figure 6) are 0.91 and 0.96 for Leu 3 Ala and Ile 3 Ala mutant, respectively. More modest correlations exist between ÁÁG and ÁV (Figure 5), with correlation coef®cients of 0. 87 for Leu 3 Ala and 0.64 for Ile 3 Ala substitutions, and between ÁÁG and packing density (correlation coef®cients of 0.61 for Leu 3 Ala and 0.60 for Ile 3 Ala mutants). Interestingly, the weighted parameter Ánh shows a considerably better correlation with ÁÁG than the non-weighted parameter Ánh_uw for which the correlation coef®cients with ÁÁG are 0.63 and 0.51 for Leu 3 Ala and Ile 3 Ala mutants, respectively.

Conclusions and Evolutionary Implications
The structural responses of ROP to large-tosmall amino acid substitutions in its hydrophobic core are generally comparable with those observed in other proteins (Xu et al., 1998; Buckle et al., 1996; Eriksson et al., 1992; Takano et al., 1995, 1997). There are small structural changes leading to a collapse of cavities formed on mutation. ROP is, however, exceptional in several aspect. There are hardly any changes in side-chain conformations in the core, but helix bending and internal water molecules re®ll the largest part of the cavities. The extent of cavity collapse in ROP is among the largest reported, with 80-90 % of the cavity volume being re®lled. Although hydrophobic packing interactions do constrain core side-chains to their wild-type conformations, the mobility of core residues in L41A is drastically increased, reaching values that are typical for exposed residues. A linear relationship between cavity volume and mutant stability, as proposed by Xu et al. (1998), is only approximately satis®ed if data from ROP, T4 lysozyme and barnase are taken together. Cavity volume turns out to be a poor parameter for analysing structural responses to mutation, since its calculation is non-trivial and its accuracy and precision depend on the algorithm and parameters used. An approximately linear relationship has been found between changes in the free energy of unfolding induced by the mutation and changes in nh, the residue contact parameter. This parameter nh is a more convenient measure of structural response than is cavity volume, since its calculation is more straightforward. Furthermore, Ánh is better

correlated to ÁÁG than other structural parameters (change of cavity volume, packing density). The scatter of the presently available data is too great to allow reliable extrapolation of ÁÁG to Ánh  0; a reliable extrapolation would allow some estimation of the hydrophobic effect involved in Leu/ Ile 3 Ala or Leu 3 Val mutations. Predictions from such estimations should be made cautiously, since, as noted by Buckle et al. (1996), it is questionable whether these estimations are suf®ciently accurate to be of predictive use. The collapse of the cavity involves a free energy of reorganization, that presumably accounts for a signi®cant fraction of the free energy derived from the extrapolation. A possible re®nement of the parameter Ánh which in its present form uses only atoms making direct contacts with the site of mutation could include the change in all atomic contacts due to the reorganization of the structure in the surrounding of the mutated residue. For the proteins studied here, the reorganization of atoms not in direct contact with the site of mutation is small and has not been taken into account. There are some possible evolutionary implications from the ÁÁG versus Ánh relationship: a statistical analysis of constraints on point mutations in protein cores, as observed in globin tertiary structures (Bordo & Argos, 1990), has suggested a mode of evolutionary development for protein interiors. In this mode, the protein core is capable of adapting to single point mutations, provided that the volume change per mutation is no more than of one methyl group. Radical changes in the overall side-chain shape and polarity are unfavorable. These constrained alterations allow the core to change without exaggerated shifts in mainchain fold of the protein interior. It can be seen

from the limited amount of data in Figure 7, that changes in side-chain size of one methyl-group are associated with a loss of stability relative to wildtype of the order of À1.0 kcal molÀ1. This value could be an estimate for non-lethal stability changes that can be tolerated in a path of step-bystep alterations of protein cores, that lead from one species to the next, without changing a main-chain fold. Thus, along an evolutionary path, structural destabilization brought by single mutations is kept to a minimum by constraining the acceptable sidechain changes.

Materials and Methods
Protein purification, crystallization and data collection The oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis (Castagnoli et al., 1989), the puri®cation scheme used (Banner et al., 1987) and the crystallization strategy (Kokkinidis et al., 1993) have been reported earlier. Mutants Leu 3 Val (L41V) and Leu 3 Ala (L41A) crystallize isomorphously to wild-type ROP from a variety of organic solvents. The crystals used for the collection of X-ray data were measured on an Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractometer. The diffraction data (Table 3) were processed using the package SDP (Frenz B.A. & Associates Inc.). Structure determination and refinement The atomic coordinates of ROP (Brookhaven Data Base (PDB) code 1ROP) were used for the calculation of difference Fourier electron density maps, from which the ROP variants were modelled using the program O (Jones et al., 1991) on Silicon Graphics workstations. Electron density maps were calculated using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992b) and were converted with MAPMAN (Kleywegt & Jones, 1996) in order to be used with O. The re®nement (Table 3) was performed using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992b). Structural analysis Structural comparisons between ROP mutants and the wild-type protein were carried out using least-squares superposition routines implemented in O and the program CONTACT from the CCP4 (1979) package. Comparisons with other proteins were carried out using the PDB entries 1BNI, 1BRH, 1BSE, 1BRJ, 1BRK for wildtype barnase and various Leu/Ile 3 Ala or Leu 3 Val variants of barnase, respectively and 1L63, 1L67, 1L90, 1L94, 247L, 200L, 240L, 241L, 243L, 244L for the pseudowild-type T4 lysozyme (Nicholson et al., 1991) and its Leu/Ile 3 Ala variants, respectively, The PDB entries 3LZM and 1L69 were used for calculations with wildtype T4 lysozyme and its L133A mutant, respectively. Calculation of internal cavities The program VOIDOO (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994) was originally used for cavity volume calculations in order to ensure a comparable approach to earlier studies (Buckle et al., 1996). Care was taken to use the same parameters as described by Buckle et al. (1996). It was found, however, that the most sensible probe radius for ROP is Ê 1.0 A, which deviates from the radii used by Buckle et al.

(1996). Since volume calculations depend strongly on the algorithm and on the parameters (e.g. grid spacing, van der Waals radii, etc.) used, we tried to verify, at least qualitatively, the results obtained with VOIDOO with an independent calculation using the program GRASP (Nickolls et al., 1991). After several different probe radii Ê were tested, a probe radius of 1.2 A was chosen for all GRASP calculations. Internal water molecules where treated as part of the protein. VOIDOO served as a control of the GRASP results and for graphical representations. The results obtained by GRASP and VOIDOO were qualitatively comparable, although the numerical values showed differences. The residue contact parameter (nh) A major contribution to the total free energy of a protein originates from non-bonded (van der Waals) hydrophobic interactions (Dill, 1990). Here, we establish (at least qualitatively) a connection between this energy term and the structural parameters in the neighborhood of the site of mutation by de®ning the residue contact parameter, nh. For core residue h (normally the site of mutation) consisting of n atoms, it is assumed that each of those atoms, i, makes Ni contacts to the atoms j, which are located in the environment of h. The contact parameter nh is then de®ned as: nh 
n Ni  1 1 d r i1 j1 iYj accYj

Parameter nh is thus numerically equal to the weighted total number of contacts made by residue h with the atoms of its environment. Each contact between atoms i and j is weighted by 1/di,j, the inverse of their distance apart, and by 1/racc,j, the inverse of the relative accessibility of the residue to which the atom j belongs. The relative accessibility was obtained from the ratio of the accessibility calculated for the residue by the DSSP program (Kabsch & Sander, 1983) to its standard accessibilty as given by Lesser et al. (1987). In order to prevent the term 1/racc,j from becoming in®nitely large for buried residues, their accessibilities are set equal to a small, non-zero value. The value used in the present work is

826
Ê 1.0 A2. The factor 1/di,j assigns a lower weight to contacts with residues far from residue h. The calculation of Ê nh was limited to the region within a radius of 6 A from h, because for the proteins studied, signi®cant structural changes do not occur beyond this distance from the site of mutation. The second term 1/racc,j assigns a higher weight to contacts made with inaccessible (i.e. core) residues. This re¯ects various observations (Bordo & Argos, 1990), suggesting that changes of internal contacts generally affect protein folding and stability more drastically than do changes of surface exposed residues. By analogy with earlier de®nitions (Otzen et al., 1995), only methyl and methylene group atoms are included in the calculation of nh. The loss of residue contacts due to mutation is described by parameter Ánh, i.e. the difference between the residue contact parameters of mutant (m) and wildtype protein (wt): Ánh  nhYm À nhYwt The Ánh_uw value, a non-weighted version of Ánh with 1/di,j and 1/racc,j replaced by 1.0, has also been calculated for the proteins under investigation.
