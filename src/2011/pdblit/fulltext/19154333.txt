Introduction
With the advent of extensively drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Gandhi et al., 2006) that are insensitive to both front-line and second-line therapy, it is imperative to find new drugs and drug combinations to treat tuberculosis patients (Anonymous, 2006). Betalactam antibiotics are arguably the most successful class of antimicrobial agents ever developed for use in humans but they have been of little effect against mycobacterial infections. There are several likely reasons for this and these include the highly impermeable cell envelope acting in conjunction with a beta-lactamase to restrict drug uptake and destroy the limited quantity of beta-lactam that enters the cell, respectively (Jarlier and Nikaido, 1990; Jarlier et al., 1991). When beta-lactam antibiotics were used together with the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanic acid or sulbactam, increased susceptibility of M. tuberculosis was observed. Likewise, some improvement was seen when imipenem, a beta-lactamase-stable drug, was employed (Chambers et al., 1995). However, while imipenem showed some efficacy against M. tuberculosis in both mice and humans, resistance was also encountered (Chambers et al., 2005). Tubercle bacilli produce a class A beta-lactamase, which hydrolyses a range of beta-lactam antibiotics, and has been characterized extensively by biochemical and structural means (Wang et al., 2006; Hugonnet and Blanchard, 2007). In some Gram-positive bacteria, betalactamase production is regulated at the level of geneexpression by proteins that sense the presence of the antibiotic. This system was well described in Bacillus licheniformis (Zhu et al., 1990; Zhu et al., 1992) but is, perhaps, best exemplified in Staphylococcus aureus where different, yet similarly organized, regulatory systems govern the expression of the blaZ, betalactamase gene, or the methicillin-resistant penicillinbinding protein 2a gene, mecA. Linked to blaZ but expressed divergently from a bicistronic operon are blaI, encoding a winged helix repressor protein (Gregory et al., 1997), and blaR1, whose product is a transmembrane (TM) protein with two distinct domains. Likewise, adjacent to mecA are mecI and mecR1, which play similar roles to blaI and blaR1 respectively. In the absence of inducer, the homodimeric BlaI/MecI proteins bind to related

Summary
Comparative genomics with Staphylococcus aureus suggested the existence of a regulatory system governing beta-lactamase (BlaC) production in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The crystal structure of Rv1846c, a winged helix regulator of previously unknown function, was solved thus revealing strong similarity to the BlaI and MecI repressors of S. aureus, which both respond to beta-lactam treatment. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and hybridization to microarrays (ChIP-on-chip), the Rv1846c regulon was shown to comprise five separate genomic loci. Two of these mediate responses and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics (rv1845c, rv1846c­rv1847; blaC­sigC); two encode membrane proteins of unknown function (rv1456c, rv3921c) while the last codes for ATP synthase (rv1303­atpBEFHAGDC­rv1312). The ChIP-onchip findings were confirmed independently using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, DNAse footprinting and transcript analysis leading to Rv1846c being renamed BlaI. When cells were treated with beta-lactams, BlaI was released from its operator sites causing derepression of the regulon and upregulation of ATP synthase transcription. The existence of a potential regulatory loop between cell wall integrity and ATP production was previously unknown.

Fig. 1. Structure-based sequence alignment of Rv1846c (from Fig. 2) and S. aureus MecI and BlaI. Secondary structures of Rv1846c and BlaI are shown above and below the alignment respectively. Invariant amino acids are shown in black background, and positions with highly conservative substitutions in grey background. Each monomer consists of a N-terminal DNA-binding domain (helices a1-a3 and strands b1-b2) and a C-terminal dimerization domain (helices a4-a6). Residues involved in DNA binding are labelled with an asterisk below the sequence.

palindromic sites in the blaZ/mecA promoter regions to prevent their expression (Gregory et al., 1997; Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2004). The BlaR1/MecR1 proteins have similar organizations with four membranespanning segments and at least two biologically active domains. The extracytoplasmic domain binds beta-lactam molecules (Wilke et al., 2004) resulting in activation of the intracytoplasmic domain, a prometalloprotease that first cleaves BlaR1/MecR1 itself before proteolysing the cognate repressor (Zhang et al., 2001). On inspection of the genome of M. tuberculosis (Cole et al., 1998), we detected two genes, rv1846c­rv1845c, which showed weak but convincing similarity to the respective blaI­blaR1 and mecI­mecR1 couplets. Although not linked to blaC, these were candidates for a potential beta-lactam-sensing signal transduction pathway, which is well conserved in mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium leprae whose genome has undergone massive gene decay (Cole et al., 2001). Consequently, we have purified the Rv1846c protein and solved its threedimensional (3D) structure. Antibodies were raised against Rv1846c and used in ChIP-on-chip experiments to immunoprecipitate chromatin for hybridization to microarrays in order to identify the target genes (Grainger et al., 2005). The Rv1846c regulon was deduced from the ChIP-on-chip results and found to comprise at least five genomic loci, of which one (sigC­blaC) is directly involved in beta-lactam resistance while all respond to induction by the antibiotic.

cal repressors BlaI and MecI respectively (Fig. 1). The similarity of Rv1846c to the BlaI/MecI repressors suggested that it might play a role in beta-lactam resistance in M. tuberculosis and this possibility was supported by resemblance between the products of the downstream gene, rv1845c, and BlaR1 or MecR1, as discussed below. Furthermore, database searches revealed Rv1846c orthologues in all members of the M. tuberculosis complex, as well as in Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium ulcerans and Mycobacterium leprae (Cole et al., 2001; Stinear et al., 2007; Stinear et al., 2008). Notably, the presence of the orthologue (ML2063) in the latter species suggests that the corresponding protein may play an important role, as it escaped the reductive evolution undergone by the leprosy bacillus (Cole et al., 2001). These intriguing similarities prompted us to further investigate the biological function of Rv1846c by means of biomolecular and structural analyses.

The crystal structure Rv 1846c was crystallized as an asymmetric dimer (two crystallographically independent monomers) in space group P212121 and as a symmetric dimer (one independent monomer) in space group I212121. The structure of the asymmetric homodimer was determined using singlewavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) techniques and refined to 1.8 Å resolution, while the second crystal form was solved by molecular replacement methods and refined to 2.7 Å (Table 1). As expected, the protein is a homodimer (Fig. 2a), whose structure is very similar to those observed for the repressors BlaI and MecI (GarciaCastellanos et al., 2003; Safo et al., 2005). Each monomer consists of an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) that displays a characteristic winged-helix architecture (composed of helices a1-a3 and beta-hairpin b1-b2)

domain terminates with a highly exposed b-hairpin (or b-wing) that in most cases also participates in protein­ DNA interactions. This compact domain is stabilized by an extended hydrophobic core involving many residues that

are largely conserved in mycobacterial orthologues as well as in the BlaI/MecI family of repressors (Fig. 1). Core residues strictly conserved in mycobacteria include Leu7, Val14, Met15, Leu18, Trp19, Val30, Leu34, Leu40, Val45, Leu49, Leu52, Leu57, Val58 and Tyr69. The overall structure of the DBD is conserved in the three crystallographically independent copies of Rv1846c (rms deviations of Ca positions for residues 10­73 in the range 0.36­0.42 Å) and also resembles the equivalent domains of BlaI and MecI, with rms deviations of 1­1.2 Å (Fig. 3). Despite the low sequence identity between the Rv1846c and BlaI/MecI DBDs (14­18%), the majority of residues important for DNA recognition in the staphylococcal repressors are largely conserved in the mycobacterial orthologue (Figs 1 and 2b). Thus, several DNA-contacting residues (namely Thr44, Thr47, Leu48, Arg51 and Lys55) in the recognition helix a3 from BlaI/ MecI, which binds to the major groove of DNA and makes most specific DNA contacts (Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2004; Safo et al., 2005), are strictly conserved in Rv1846c, except for the substitution Leu48-Val (Fig. 1). Within the a3 helix, only BlaI Arg46 (which makes hydrogen-bonding contacts with the DNA phosphate backbone) is substituted by a strictly conserved methionine in mycobacterial Rv1846c orthologues. Also conserved outside the recognition helix is Lys3 (Lys4 in BlaI/

MecI), which was found to be important for BlaI repression (Gregory et al., 1997). Three other residues that were observed to interact with the DNA backbone in the BlaI/ MecI-operator complexes (Glu7 at the N-terminus of the protein, Asn28 in helix a2 and Asn65 in the b-hairpin; BlaI numbering) are all substituted by a conserved arginine in Rv1846c orthologues (Fig. 1), suggesting that they could fulfill a similar phosphate-binding role. The dimerization domain (DD) of Rv1846c, formed by helices a4-a6, displays the typical `spiral staircase' architecture observed for the staphylococcal repressors (Fig. 2), although with some differences. In particular, the overall conformation of the Rv1846c monomer differs in the three crystallographically independent molecules, as shown in Fig. 3 upon superposition of the DBDs, and these differences are even greater when compared with BlaI in its DNA-bound conformation (Garcia-Castellanos et al., 2004). This comparison reveals a conformational flexibility of the Rv1846c DBDs with respect to the DD, which may be important for DNA binding. Indeed, a similar conformational flexibility and hinge-bending movement have been observed for the unbound and DNA-bound forms of BlaI (Safo et al., 2005) as well as for the (structurally similar) bacterial transcriptional regulators MexR (Lim et al., 2002) and MtaN (Godsey et al., 2001). The structure-based sequence alignment of Rv1846c, BlaI and MecI also shows local differences at the linker between helices a4 and a5 (Fig. 1). While all structures have a short linker segment, in Rv1846c helix a4 is oneturn shorter and helix a5 has an additional N-terminal turn. Also, the C-terminal region of Rv1846c is 12 or 15 residues longer than those of BlaI and MecI respectively. However, all residues beyond the last residue of helix a6 (Ala124, which coincides with the end of a6 in BlaI, Fig. 1) are disordered (and possibly flexible) in the Rv1846c crystal structures. Defining the biological role of Rv1846c The 3D structure indicates that Rv1846c is a transcriptional regulator and, as such, is expected to control expression of a certain number of genes. In order to define the Rv1846c regulon and unravel its biological function we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and hybridization to microarrays (ChIP-on-chip). After hybridization, arrays were scanned and the signals plotted against their relative position on the M. tuberculosis H37Rv chromosome using Artemis (Rutherford et al., 2000). Figure 4 and Table 2 present the results obtained from four independent experiments. A total of five putative Rv1846c binding sites were found throughout the genome. The first one (Table 2) was located in the intergenic region between rv1846c and rv1847, encoding a hypothetical protein with a

thioesterase domain. As Rv1846c-like proteins usually control their own expression (Gregory et al., 1997), this signal suggests that Rv1846c regulates its own transcription. Another binding site was noted in the intergenic region between blaC, which codes for the sole class A beta-lactamase in M. tuberculosis, and sigC, encoding an ECF subfamily sigma factor. Moreover, strong signals (Fig. 4; Table 2) were found upstream of rv1456c, which codes for an essential antibiotic-transporting ABCtransporter, and rv1303, encoding a membrane protein. Interestingly, rv1303 partially overlaps the first gene of the ATP synthase gene cluster, atpB, thereby suggesting that they may all constitute a single transcriptional unit. Indeed, RT-PCR experiments demonstrated the existence of a polycistronic RNA covering both genes (Fig. S1). Thus, binding of Rv1846c upstream of rv1303 contributes to the transcriptional regulation of the ATP synthase genes. Finally, a putative binding site was discovered upstream of rv3921c, predicted to encode another essential conserved TM protein. Taken together, these data suggest that Rv1846c controls a small subset of genes involved in regulation, antibiotic transport and detoxification, membrane components and, most surprisingly, genes responsible for ATP synthesis. Confirming ChIP-on-chip results In order to validate ChIP-on-chip results and confirm the ability of Rv1846c to bind to the corresponding DNA regions, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed using specific DNA fragments covering the rv1845c­rv1847 region and purified Rv1846c (see Fig 5A and B). Fragment 1, which encompasses the rv1846c­rv1847 intergenic region, was clearly shifted, while fragment 3, which extends into the rv1846c coding sequence, bound Rv1846c to a lesser extent. By contrast, Rv1846c did not bind to fragments 2, 4 and 5, covering intragenic regions. These data confirmed ChIP-on-chip findings indicating the presence of a binding site in the region upstream of the rv1846c gene. Moreover, the protein­DNA interaction was found to be dosedependent, as shown in Fig. 5C, suggesting the presence of more than one binding site or cooperative binding to DNA. Rv1846c was also able to bind to the orthologous M. leprae DNA region (coordinates 2 450 333­ 2 450 701), suggesting the existence of a conserved regulatory mechanism (Fig. 5C). Further EMSA experiments were performed to validate Rv1846c binding to the intergenic region between blaC and sigC (coordinates 2 326 777­2 326 965), and to the region upstream of rv1456c (coordinates 1 642 366­1 642 545). As shown in Fig. 5D, both DNA fragments were shifted in the presence of increasing amounts of the protein, thus confirming ChIP-on-chip results.

Further insight into the regulation of rv1846c­rv1847 was achieved by mapping the 5 ends of their transcripts using 5 RACE on RNA extracted from M. tuberculosis H37Rv. A single PCR product was obtained for each gene and directly sequenced. The 5 end of rv1846c was located 23 bases upstream of the translation start codon, thus giving a transcript containing a predicted ribosome binding site in its leader region, whereas the transcription start site of rv1847 coincides with the GTG initiation codon, giving rise to a leaderless mRNA. The location of the potential promoters is consistent with the position of the previously identified Rv1846c operator site and the two regulatory regions likely overlap (Fig. S2). Bioinformatic analysis predicted the binding site for Rv1846c to be located 241 bp upstream of the rv1303 translation start codon. As this position is quite far from the gene, we investigated transcription of the rv1303­atp operon by RT-PCR and 5 RACE. Results reported in

This binding site is located upstream of rv1846c, likely in the region encompassing the 5-regulatory sequences, thus confirming that Rv1846c controls its own expression. Moreover, at higher protein concentrations (0.5­1 mg) two more distal protected sequences were identified in the intergenic region between rv1846c and rv1847: the first extending from coordinate -102 to -128, and the second from -145 to -177. These findings were confirmed when the complementary strand was probed (data not shown). The sequence of the protected region extending from coordinate -32 to -63 was used to define the Rv1846c operator sequence by multiple alignments of the cognate regions from M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, M. marinum, M. ulcerans and M. smegmatis. In agreement with the protein structure, the operator site was found to be an inverted repeat with the following consensus: TACG/TAC<5>GTA/CGTA. This sequence was then used to scan the M. tuberculosis genome, thereby identifying all potential members of the regulon. Interestingly, the operator site was found in the appropriate position upstream of all of the target genes identified by ChIP-on-chip experiments, with the number of mismatches ranging from none (as in the case of rv1303) to two, as for rv3921c (Table 3). Other sites were identified by bioinformatics (Table S1) but, on re-examination of the ChIP-on-chip data, the corresponding genes did not appear to be part of the Rv1846c regulon, except for cydA, encoding a component of the respiratory chain, the integral membrane cytochrome D ubiquinol oxidase. This binding site was detected in three out of four ChIP-on-chip experiments but the calculated score was substantially lower than those of the other target genes.

Fig. S1 indicate the presence of a transcript with a long leader that extends far upstream of the rv1303 start codon and whose 5 end was mapped 194 bp upstream of the gene (Fig. S3). This is consistent with the location of the Rv1846c operator site and suggests an overlap with the promoter region. Bioinformatic analysis of the leader region ruled out the presence of un-annotated small open reading frames and the only predicted Shine-Dalgarno sequence was 8 bp upstream of rv1303, consistent with the position of the translational start codon. Response to beta-lactam treatment ChIP-on-chip was used to test whether Rv1846c, like BlaI and MecI, responds to beta-lactam antibiotics. The results from M. tuberculosis cells, mock-treated or treated with amoxicillin and clavulanate, or clavulanate alone, are presented in Fig. 6 and Table 3. Compared with the untreated sample, addition of clavulanate caused no decrease in signal, whereas amoxicillin treatment resulted in a marked reduction, indicating release of the repressor from the binding sites and presumably expression of the target genes. These results were supported by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from mock-treated or amoxicillin-treated M. tuberculosis cultures. Target transcripts were amplified in the presence of Sybr Green and relative expression calculated using sigA as housekeeping gene and the untreated sample as reference. Increased amounts of transcripts were detected for all of the target genes (Fig. 7), indicating the existence of a common regulatory mechanism. In particular, rv1303 and atpB, which were shown to constitute a single operon, were both induced after treatment, confirming their coregulation. Moreover, there is an inverse correlation between the induction level observed upon antibiotic treatment and the conservation of the operator site: the more the gene is induced, the less the operator site conforms to the consensus (Table 3). Taken together, these data confirm that Rv1846c plays an important role in a regulatory system involved in response to cell wall stress and damage.

Discussion
In this work, we have established and validated ChIP-onchip technology for M. tuberculosis by studying the genome-wide distribution of Rv1846c, a transcriptional regulator of the winged helix superfamily, whose 3D structure has also been determined in order to facilitate understanding of its function. ChIP-on-chip experiments identified the Rv1846c regulon as comprising five members, including rv1846c itself and genes involved in antibiotic transport, detoxification and cell wall function.

Remarkably, one of the target sites is located upstream of the rv1303­atpBEFHAGDC­rv1312 operon, arousing curiosity and interest about the regulation of the genes coding for ATP synthase. We will return to this point below.

Immunoprecipitation results were confirmed independently by EMSAs and DNAse footprinting. On binding to its target regions, Rv1846c exhibited a typical pattern, characterized by multiple shifts at increasing protein concentrations, suggesting the presence of more than one binding site or a cooperative interaction with DNA. This observation was supported by footprinting experiments, where, in addition to a region proximal to the ORF, two more binding sites were identified between rv1846c and rv1847. These latter regions were protected at high protein concentrations and their sequences show very little conservation when compared with the sequence of the proximal site. In addition, no similar motifs were found upstream of the other Rv1846c-regulated genes, thus implying cooperativity and/or oligomerization of Rv1846c on binding to DNA, as previously reported for the S. aureus MecI repressor (Sharma et al., 1998; Safo et al., 2006). The site, extending from -32 to -63, clearly overlaps the rv1846c promoter region (Fig. S2) and Rv1846c thus controls its own expression. The aforementioned cooperativity displayed by the repressor on binding to DNA may also explain control of rv1847, with Rv1846c wrapping around DNA, as suggested for the MecI orthologue (Safo et al., 2006). Footprinting and multiple sequence alignments allowed the identification of the Rv1846c operator site as an inverted repeat, consistent with the protein acting as a dimer (Fig. 2), with each half-site resembling GTAGTA. Moreover, on screening the complete M. tuberculosis genome, the operator site was found upstream of all of the target genes identified by ChIP-on-chip. In particular, the

sequence upstream of rv1303 is the best conserved, with a perfect match, whereas the others have a variable number of mismatches, ranging from one (rv1456c) to two (rv3921c). Re-examination of the ChIP-on-chip data sets after in silico analysis allowed the identification of an additional binding site corresponding to the cydA gene. The region upstream of cydA might represent another Rv1846c target but binding there could either be weaker or dependent upon specific culture conditions. Indeed, expression of cydA was induced upon beta-lactam treatment (up to 1.9-fold), thus representing another link between betalactam damage and respiration. The other genes, identified by bioinformatic tools but not by Chip-on-chip, may represent false positives. Alternatively, they might have escaped identification by immunoprecipitation because of inefficient cross-linking at some DNA loci or epitope masking due to particular nucleoprotein topologies. As expected, the operator sequence and Rv1846c regulon are conserved in all other sequenced mycobacterial genomes. These observations were extended when the structural data on repressor-operator complexes were examined. Thus, the overall conservation of DNA-contacting residues in Rv1846c and BlaI/MecI (Figs 1 and 2b) strongly suggests a similar mode of DNA recognition. The analysis of the operator sequences recognized by Rv1846c and the conservation of these regions in mycobacterial genomes lend further support to this hypothesis. The conserved DNA sequence motif is palindromic, with its halfsite (which binds a single HTH motif) having the sequence

GTAGTA, which is very similar to the reported BlaI/MecI recognition motif, GTAXT (Safo et al., 2005). The major difference appears to be the length of the spacer between the two half-sites, which is five base pairs in Rv1846c operators instead of four as in blaI/mecI. However, the observed flexibility of the DBDs in the Rv1846c homodimer (Fig. 3) could easily compensate for this single-base-pair shift, thus rendering possible a similar pattern of protein­DNA interactions as observed for the staphylococcal repressors. Taken together, the above observations strongly support a similar mode of action of staphylococcal BlaI/MecI and the mycobacterial Rv1846c-like repressors. Extensive in vivo and in vitro studies have been performed to identify residues involved in protein­DNA interaction in Rv1846c orthologues. Wittman et al. (1993) demonstrated that deletion of six-amino-acid residues from the N-terminal region of the B. licheniformis penicillinase repressor eliminates the operator recognition and repression functions. In addition, site-specific mutagenesis in S. aureus BlaI and MecI proved the importance of the highly conserved residues Lys-4 and Asp-39, respectively, with the resultant mutant proteins being strongly compromised in their ability to bind to DNA and repress transcription (Gregory et al., 1997; Sharma et al., 1998). All proteins from the BlaI/MecI family of bacterial repressors are inactivated by proteolytic cleavage at the highly conserved Asn-101­Phe-102 (BlaI numbering) peptide bond in the middle of helix a5 (Fig. 1). In Rv1846c orthologues, the sequence motif around the putative cleavage site is largely conserved except for the asparagine preceding the cleavage site, which is substituted by histidine in most mycobacterial sequences. This suggests a similar mode of repressor inactivation by proteolysis in mycobacteria, although the protease involved might have a different specificity. Comparative genomics was used to identify a potential protease candidate in M. tuberculosis. The S. aureus mec and bla operons have a similar genomic organization, with the genes for the signal transducer and repressor forming a two-gene operon (blaI­blaR1 and mecI­mecR1) that is divergently transcribed from its regulatory target gene (blaZ or mecA). The BlaR1/MecR1 proteins are proteases that cleave their cognate repressor following activation, and have a particular TM topology: three TM segments followed by a cytoplasmic protease domain, another TM segment and the extracellular beta-lactam-binding sensory domain. Interestingly, rv1846c is also part of a two-gene operon with rv1845c, and the latter's product has the same predicted topology as BlaR1/MecR1 (except for a missing C-terminal sensory domain) with which it also shares low overall sequence similarity. This resemblance, together with the presence of the peptidase

family M48 motif (IPR001915), suggests that Rv1845c is likely to be a zinc-requiring metalloprotease, although its activation mechanism is different from those of BlaR1/ MecR1. When rv1845c was interrupted by a transposon, the resultant mutant showed a slow growth phenotype (Sassetti and Rubin, 2003; Sassetti et al., 2003). As Rv1845c (and all its mycobacterial orthologues) lacks an extracellular sensor domain, the antibiotic sensing mechanism operating in M. tuberculosis must be different: sensing may occur via interaction with the residual extracellular portion or could be mediated by other membrane proteins. Here, a possible candidate is the M. tuberculosis serine/threonine protein kinase, PknB, with its C-terminal PASTA domains, that have been implicated in interaction with beta-lactam antibiotics (Yeats et al., 2002; Wehenkel et al., 2008). Direct evidence for Rv1846c responding to beta-lactam antibiotics was obtained using ChIP-on-chip and quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Upon amoxicillin treatment, Rv1846c detaches from its operator allowing transcription to take place. All of the genes in the regulon were de-repressed after antibiotic treatment and their induction level inversely correlated with the degree of conservation of the binding motif; the greater the conservation the weaker the induction observed. In addition, these results indicate that ChIP-on-chip technology can be exploited as a complementary approach to transcriptomics to define response to drug treatment or to different growth conditions. Based on our findings, we have renamed rv1845c and rv1846c as blaR and blaI respectively. A further link to beta-lactams is the finding that BlaI controls expression of the blaC gene, encoding a class A beta-lactamase, which confers resistance to a variety of penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems (Hugonnet and Blanchard, 2007). Interestingly, blaC has been deleted from the M. leprae genome whereas the blaR­ blaI orthologues (ML2064 and ML2063 respectively) are still present (Cole et al., 2001). This indicates that the beta-lactamase is not required by M. leprae and suggests that the signal transduction system might be involved in different physiological processes, like responding to peptidoglycan damage or to ATP synthase inhibitors. Co-expressed with blaC in M. tuberculosis is the sigC gene encoding an alternative RNA polymerase sigma factor, required for the transcription of a regulon important in pathogenesis (Sun et al., 2004; Karls et al., 2006), which includes senX and mtrA, members of twocomponent systems (Sun et al., 2004). Transcription of these two genes was not affected by beta-lactam treatment (data not shown). The most intriguing and unexpected result of our work is the regulation of the rv1303­atpBEFHAGDC­rv1312 operon by BlaI and the beta-lactam, amoxicillin. Transcript analysis (Fig. S1) showed rv1303 to be cotranscribed with

atpB as part of a polycistronic RNA and orthologues of rv1303 precede the atp genes in all sequenced mycobacterial genomes. The rv1303 gene, which encodes a membrane protein of unknown function, is restricted to mycobacteria (Fig. S4) and appears to be essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis in macrophages (Rengarajan et al., 2005). Following atpC by 8 bp is rv1312, which codes for a 147 aa membrane protein, and this gene occurs in the atp operon of all sequenced actinobacteria (Fig. S4). It is curious that the gene arrangement for such an important and ubiquitous function as ATP synthase should be so atypical in mycobacteria. Our findings have uncovered a possible link between ATP production and beta-lactam-induced cell wall damage, and BlaI/BlaR may act as a bridge between them. Peptidoglycan biosynthesis requires ATP and the cell wall damage arising from its inhibition might perturb the proton gradient across the membrane thereby reducing ATP synthase activity. Restoring ATP synthase function, in order to provide sufficient ATP for survival and, later on, for growth, would require de novo synthesis of the enzyme. Indeed, using transcriptomics, Boshoff et al. (2004) reported upregulation of blaI (rv1846c) when M. tuberculosis was treated with respiratory and ATP synthase inhibitors, thus suggesting that BlaI is involved in the response to different physiological stresses. In the absence of stress, a basal transcription level is guaranteed and translation of the polycistronic rv1303­ atpBEFHAGDC­rv1312 transcript would ensure production of ATP synthase and thus sufficient ATP levels inside the cell. Based on a model proposed previously for S. aureus (Wilke et al., 2004), BlaI might be cleaved by BlaR upon inhibition of ATP synthase and the rv1303­ atpBEFHAGDC­rv1312 operon would then be de-repressed, so that the circuit returns to steady state. It is particularly interesting that a blaR (rv1845c) mutant that fails to make the BlaR protease grows very slowly (Sassetti et al., 2003) and this may be explained by constant repression of rv1303 by BlaI resulting in a shortage of ATP synthase. This hypothesis, and the effect of ATP synthase inhibitors, will be investigated further.

Oligonucleotides and plasmids
Plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study are reported in Tables S2 and S3.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments
Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures (50 ml) grown up to OD600 0.4­0.6 were treated with formaldehyde (final concentration 1%) and incubated 10 min at 37°C. Cross-linking was quenched by addition of glycine (final concentration 125 mM). Cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and stored at -80°C. Pellets were re-suspended in 4 ml Immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Hepes-KOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, Roche Antiprotease mini) and sonicated in a water bath sonicator (Bioruptor, Diagenode) to shear DNA to an average size of 300­700 bp. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was used as input sample in immunoprecipitation experiments. Approximately 3.2 ml of the input sample was incubated overnight at 4°C on a rotating wheel with 20 ml of serum containing anti-Rv1846c rat polyclonal antibodies. An immunoprecipitation experiment without antibody was also set up as negative control. Protein­DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with 80 ml of Dynabeads Sheep anti-Rat IgG (Dynal Biotech) for 90 min at 4°C. The magnetic beads were then collected and washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer, once with immunoprecipitation buffer plus 500 mM NaCl, once with wash buffer III (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and once with Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 7.5). Immunoprecipitated complexes were eluted from the beads by treatment with 100 ml elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) at 65°C for 20 min. Samples were then treated with RNase A and cross-links were reversed by incubation for 2 h at 56°C and 6 h at 65°C in 0.5¥ elution buffer plus 50 mg proteinase K. DNA was extracted twice with phenolchloroform, precipitated and re-suspended in 20 ml of water.

Microarray design, labelling and hybridization
Microarrays were designed and manufactured by Oxford Gene Technology (OGT), using Agilent technology. Arrays consist of 22 575 60-mer oligonucleotide probes, covering the genomes of the M. tuberculosis strains H37Rv and CDC1551, and the M. bovis strains AF2122/97 and BCG Pasteur. On average, there is an oligonucleotide probe every 203 bases. DNA obtained from immunoprecipitation and total genomic DNA were labelled by Klenow random priming, with Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare), respectively, and purified with Qiagen MinElute kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Labelled DNA was hybridized to microarrays in an Agilent Technologies Microarray chamber at 55°C for 72 h in the following buffer: 1 M NaCl, 50 mM MES, 20% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100. The arrays were then washed once in 6¥ SSPE (0.18 M NaCl, 10 mM phosphate pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA), 0.005% N-lauryl sarcosine and once in 0.06% SSPE, 0.18% polyethylene glycol 200, both for

Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was grown in Dubos Broth (Difco) supplemented with Middlebrook albumindextrose-catalase (ADC) enrichment and 0.05% Tween 80 or on solid Middlebrook 7H11 medium (Difco) supplemented with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC). Betalactam treatment was performed by adding amoxicillin (Sigma) or amoxicillin plus clavulanate (Sigma) to exponentially growing cultures at the concentrations indicated in the Results section and incubating at 37°C for 3 h.

5 min at room temperature. Finally, microarrays were dried in isopropanol and immediately scanned.

Microarray scanning and data analysis
For data acquisition, we used an Agilent Technologies microarray scanner and results were extracted by using Genepix Pro 5.0 software. The Cy3/Cy5 intensity ratio was calculated for each spot and plotted against the corresponding genomic position on the H37Rv chromosome in the Artemis software (Rutherford et al., 2000). The physical arrangement of probes on the array does not reflect their location on the M. tuberculosis chromosome; data are put in the genomic order after scanning of the microarrays. Because DNA fragments obtained from ChIP experiments were between 300 and 700 bp, they were expected to hybridize to different probes adjacent to each other on H37Rv genome. A putative binding site was defined as a stretch of two or more consecutive spots with a > 2-fold Cy3/Cy5 ratio in all of the four independent experiments. Genes were described according to TubercuList (http:// genolist.pasteur.fr/TubercuList/).

Tris-EDTA buffer plus 75 ml RNA lysis buffer (4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.01 M Tris pH 7.5, 0.97% b-mercaptoethanol). The suspension was sonicated in a water bath sonicator (Bioruptor, Diagenode) for 15 min (cycles of 30 s ON and 30 s OFF) at 4°C in 1.5 ml tubes. RNA was then purified with the SV Total RNA Isolation System, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Samples were subsequently extracted once with phenol-chloroform using Maxtract High Density Gel (Qiagen) and ethanol precipitated. After DNase treatment and a second phenol-chloroform extraction, RNA was re-suspended in water and stored at -80°C. The amount and purity of RNA was determined spectrophotometrically.

5 RACE
Two micrograms of M. tuberculosis H37Rv RNA and 1 mg of primer 69, 72 or 120 (for rv1846c, rv1847 and rv1303 5 end mapping respectively) were incubated at 70°C for 5 min and then at 55°C for one hour in the presence of 1¥ cDNA synthesis buffer, 1 mM dNTPs, 40 U RNase inhibitor, 25 U Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche). cDNA was then purified with the High Pure PCR Product Purification kit (Roche), and used in the subsequent poly(A) tailing reaction (30 min at 37°C in the presence of 0.2 mM dATP and 80 U Terminal Transferase, Roche). Semi-nested PCR amplification on poly(A)-tailed cDNA was performed using an oligo dT-anchor primer and primers 70, 73 or 109 for rv1846c, rv1847 and rv1303 respectively. Only one amplification product for each gene was obtained and directly sequenced.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
DNA probes for gel shift experiments were amplified by PCR with specific primers containing either a BamHI or EcoRI site at the 5 end, labelled with the Klenow enzyme and [a-32P]dATP, and purified with the Qiaquick Nucleotide Removal kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Binding reactions were performed in 10 ml of binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 50 mg ml-1 BSA, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mg ml-1 of salmon sperm DNA) with about 5 fmol of the probe and different amounts of Rv1846c protein, for 20 min at room temperature. Reactions were loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and run at 150 V for 2 h at room temperature. Gels were then dried and exposed to PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) detection.

RT-PCR
Two micrograms of M. tuberculosis RNA was incubated with 2.5 mM random primers at 70°C for 5 min. After cooling on ice, 1 mM dNTPs, 40 U RNase inhibitor and 25 U Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche) were added in a final volume of 20 ml. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and at 55°C for 30 min. cDNA was then used in the next PCR amplification, using oligonucleotides 67, 68, 77, 78, 107.

Footprinting experiments
DNA probes carrying BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were obtained by PCR amplification, digested with either BamHI or EcoRI, labelled with the Klenow enzyme and [a-32P]-dATP, and purified. Binding reactions were performed as described for the EMSA experiments, with about 60 000 c.p.m. of probe in a final volume of 50 ml. DNase I digestion was carried out by treatment with 1 ml of 0.12 mg ml-1 DNase I and 2 mM CaCl2 for 1 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by addition of 25 ml of DNase stop buffer (0.1 M EDTA, 0.8% SDS, 1.6 M NH4-Acetate, 300 mg ml-1 salmon sperm DNA), ethanol precipitated and re-suspended in 12 ml of sample buffer (7 M urea, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8) with tracking dyes. Samples were then loaded on a 7 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Maxam-Gilbert G+A sequencing reactions were performed as described previously (Maxam and Gilbert, 1977).

Quantitative RT-PCR
Two micrograms of RNA were reverse-transcribed with random primers and Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase as described above. Sybr Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used to quantify target cDNA molecules in a 20 ml reaction containing 100 nM of each primer, 10 ml Master Mix, 1 ml cDNA. Each reaction was run in duplicate in an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System with the following protocol: denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s and annealing/ elongation with data collection at 60°C for 40 s. Melting curves were constructed to ensure that only one amplification product was obtained. Relative expression of target genes was determined according to the DDCt method, with sigA as standard, using the following calculation: Ratio = [(1 + Efficiency of amplificationsigA)Ct(treatment) : (1 + Efficiency of amplificationgene of interest)Ct(treatment)] : [(1 + Efficiency of amplificationsigA)Ct(no treatment sample) : (1 + Efficiency of amplificationgene of interest)Ct(no treatment sample)].

RNA extraction
Forty millilitres of M. tuberculosis H37Rv cultures (OD600 = 0.4) were pelleted and cells re-suspended in 100 ml

Recombinant protein production
The Rv1846c coding sequence was amplified by two-step PCR from the genomic DNA of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Cole et al., 1998) and cloned into the expression vector pDEST17 (Invitrogen). Transformed BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were used to inoculate 500 ml of LB medium containing 100 mg ml-1 ampicillin and 25 mg ml-1 chloramphenicol. The culture was grown for 4 h at 30°C and induced with 1 mM isopropopyl b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at OD600 of 0.8­0.9. After 1.5 h of induced growth, cells were harvested by centrifugation, re-suspended and frozen. Cellular suspension was thawed and, after cell lysis and centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) and the protein eluted by a linear gradient of imidazole. The purified protein (at 0.5 mg ml-1 in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer with 0.1 M NaCl and 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) was incubated with His6tagged TEV protease at a protein-TEV ratio (w/w) of 1:7 for 6 h at 30°C and the reaction stopped by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded on Ni-NTA resin and the flow-through (containing the tag-free protein) was loaded on a calibrated HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 14.4 mg ml-1 (10 mg ml-1 for the SeMet-labelled protein) for crystallization. Dynamic light scattering and size exclusion chromatography suggest that Rv1846c is a dimer in solution, as observed for BlaI and MecI.

and for the native protein in space group I212121 were collected using synchrotron radiation on beamline ID14-4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble (France). For data collection, crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing the mother liquor + 25% (v/v) of glycerol. Crystallographic parameters and data collection statistics are shown in Table 1. The structure was determined using SAD data from a P212121 crystal of SeMet-labelled Rv1846c, measured at the K edge of selenium. The substructure of the Se atoms was solved using program SOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999), locating six sites corresponding to all but the N-terminal Met residues of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit. Electron density maps to 2.5 Å resolution were calculated with solvent-flipped SAD phases and initial tracing of the polypeptide chains was carried out with the program ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999). The initial model was extended by superimposing equivalent structural features of the two independent monomers, and final refinement and model optimization was carried out to 1.8 Å resolution by alternating crystallographic refinement cycles with the program REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1997) and manual rebuilding with the program COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). The refined model was subsequently used to solve the structure of the second crystal form using molecular replacement methods (Navaza, 1994), which was refined as described above. The parameters for the final refinement cycles are shown in Table 1.

Generation of antiserum to Rv1846c
Four Lewis rats were immunised subcutaneously with 15 mg recombinant Rv1846c in Montanide ISA720 adjuvant (Seppic, Paris, France) in a total volume of 0.3 ml. On days 13 and 34, the rats received a booster immunisation, and at days 26 and 47, serum samples were collected. The serum samples were evaluated for recognition of recombinant Rv1846c by Western blot analysis, using alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat-anti-rat IgG (A8438, Sigma-Aldrich, Brøndby, Denmark) for detection, a serum-pool from naïve rats was used as a negative control. All serum samples collected from immunised rats showed a positive response, and were thereafter pooled and used as antiserum to Rv1846c.

Crystallization and structure determination
Initial robotic crystallization screenings were carried out at 18°C with a Cartesian Technology workstation, using sitting drops composed of 200 nl of native protein (10 mg ml-1) and 200 nl of mother liquor equilibrated against 150 ml of the well solution on Greiner plates. Two different crystal forms of the protein were obtained at 18°C and manually optimized. The best diffracting crystals belong to space group P212121 (with two monomers in the asymmetric unit) and were obtained in 1.6 M NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM Na citrate, pH 5.6. The second form (space group I212121 with one monomer in the asymmetric unit) was grown in 2.4 M Na acetate and 100 mM Na cacodylate, pH 6.5.
