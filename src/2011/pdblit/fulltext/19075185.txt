Fibrinogen residue B 432Asp is part of hole "b" that interacts with knob "B," whose sequence starts with Gly-His-ArgPro-amide (GHRP). Because previous studies showed B D432A has normal polymerization, we hypothesized that B 432Asp is not critical for knob "B" binding and that new knob-hole interactions would compensate for the loss of this Asp residue. To test this hypothesis,

we solved the crystal structure of fragment D from B D432A. Surprisingly, the structure (rfD-B D432A GH) showed the peptide GHRP was not bound to hole "b." We then re-evaluated the polymerization of this variant by examining clot turbidity, clot structure, and the rate of FXIIIa crosslinking. The turbidity and the rate of dimer formation for B D432A were indistinguishable compared with normal fi-

brinogen. Scanning electron microscopy showed no significant differences between the clots of B D432A and normal, but the thrombin-derived clots had thicker fibers than clots obtained from batroxobin, suggesting that cleavage of FpB is more important than "B:b" interactions. We conclude that hole "b" and "B:b" knob-hole binding per se have no influence on fibrin polymerization. (Blood. 2009;113:4425-4430)

Introduction
The fibrinogen molecule consists of 3 pairs of nonidentical polypeptide chains: A , B , and . These chains are folded into 3 distinct structural regions: 2 distal D regions and 1 central E region, linked by coiled-coil connectors forming a trinodular structure.1 Each D region contains polymerization holes "a" and "b" located in the C-terminus of the - and B -chains, respectively. The central E region contains 2 sets of polymerization knobs "A" and "B" that are cryptic in fibrinogen but become exposed in fibrin after thrombin cleaves fibrinopeptide A (FpA) and fibrinopeptide B (FpB) from the N-terminus of the A - and B -chains, respectively.1,2 The exposed knob "A" binds to hole "a" of another fibrin molecule forming "A:a" interactions that lead to a double-stranded protofibril with a half-staggered overlap between molecules in different strands. Cleavage of FpB occurs primarily during protofibril growth, leading to the binding of knob "B" to hole "b" forming "B:b" interactions.1 The location of the binding holes and possible models for knob-hole interactions are known from X-ray crystallographic studies using 2 synthetic peptide analogs of knobs "A" and "B." When fibrinogen fragment D and double-D are crystallized in the presence of both peptide analogs, the knob "A" peptide mimic, Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-amide (GPRP), forms H-bond interactions with residues 364Asp, 330Asp, 329Gln, and 340His found in hole "a."3-5 In the same manner, the knob "B" peptide mimic, Gly-His-Arg-Pro-amide (GHRP), interacts with residues B 397Glu, B 398Asp, and B 432Asp in hole "b."3,5,6 The functional role of "A:a" interactions was demonstrated in several studies with reported dysfibrinogenemias,7,8 as well as studies with 364Asp variant fibrinogens.9 Although the importance of "A:a" interactions have been well documented, the role of "B:b" interactions is still unclear. Previously published data on B D432A fibrinogen, a variant with mutation in hole "b," showed normal polymerization.10 Without structural data for B D432A, it is reasonable to anticipate that B Asp432 may not be critical in binding knob "B" and that there may be alternative and new sets of interactions in B D432A that would still allow "B:b" interactions to occur. We also based this hypothesis on recent studies with D364A variant fibrinogen.11 The 2 aspartate residues, B Asp432 in hole "b" and Asp364 in hole "a," form ionic interactions with the positively charged free amino-terminus of their corresponding knob. Residues B Asp432 and Asp364 are located at equivalent positions in the - and -chain polymerization holes, respectively.3,5 Whereas D364A showed severely impaired function, structural data on this variant surprisingly showed that hole "a" binds knob "A" peptide mimic, GPRP, suggesting that the residue Asp364 per se is not critical for "A:a" interactions.11 In contrast to D364A, we now report that B D432A does not bind knob "B" peptide mimic, GHRP, and that the residue B Asp432 is critical for "B:b" interactions. This surprising finding led us to further examine the polymerization of B D432A and re-evaluate the importance of hole "b" and "B:b" interactions. Our biochemical data suggest that B D432A, indeed, has normal polymerization, despite having impaired hole "b." In summary, our findings suggest that hole "b" may have very little influence on polymerization and that other events, such as FpB release, are more critical to polymerization, rather than the actual "B:b" knob-hole binding.

the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). Monoclonal IF-1 antibody was purchased from Kamiya Biomedical (Seattle, WA). Expression and purification of recombinant fibrinogen B D432A Normal and variant B D432A fibrinogens were synthesized in CHO cells as described previously.10 Large-scale protein expression was carried out in serum-free medium in roller bottles. Media containing secreted fibrinogen were harvested periodically. After addition of protease inhibitors, the media were stored at 20°C.12 Recombinant fibrinogen was purified as described.13 Briefly, fibrinogen was precipitated from the media with ammonium sulfate in the presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors. The precipitate was resuspended in buffer containing 10 mM CaCl2 and applied to a Sepharose 4B column coupled with the fibrinogen specific monoclonal antibody, IF-1. Fibrinogen was eluted from the column with buffer containing 5 mM EDTA; dialyzed against HEPES buffered saline (HBS) (20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) and 1 mM CaCl2 for one exchange then extensively dialyzed against HBS; and stored at 80°C. The integrity of the polypeptide chains and purity of the recombinant protein were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing and nonreducing condition following the method of Laemmli.14 Preparation and purification of fragment D Fragment D was prepared from B D432A by controlled trypsin digestion, according to the method used for normal recombinant fibrinogen.5 Briefly, CaCl2 (final concentration of 20 mM) was added to 10 mg B D432A fibrinogen in HBS and digestion was initiated by adding 100 L immobilized TPCK trypsin (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). The reaction was allowed to proceed over a period of days until SDS-PAGE revealed essentially 2 bands that correspond to the molecular weights of fragments D and E. Digestion was stopped by removing the trypsin beads with centrifugation at 1200g (Sorvall RC-3; DuPont Instruments, Wilmington, DE) for 10 minutes. Fragment D was purified by peptide affinity chromatography based on previously described methods.15 Briefly, the digest was loaded onto a polymeric resin covalently linked to the peptide GPRPAA. Fragment D was eluted using 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.3) and 1 M NaBr. Purified fragment D was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, concentrated 100-fold with a centrifugal filter device (50-kDa MW cutoff; Millipore, Billerica, MA), and stored at 4°C. Crystallization of fragment D from B D432A Purified B D432A fragment D was cocrystallized with GHRP by sittingdrop diffusion at 4°C similar to methods previously described for normal fragment D crystallization.3,5 Crystals were grown from drops containing 5 L B D432A fragment D initially at 10 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and GHRP at 4 mM mixed with an equal volume of well solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mM NaN3, 12.5 mM CaCl2, and 11% to 14% (wt/vol) PEG 3350. Single crystals appeared in days, after streak seeding with crystals of normal recombinant fragment D. X-ray diffraction data collection and structure determination Data collection for crystals of B D432A fibrinogen fragment D (rfDB D432A GH) was carried out at 100 K using SER-CAT beamline 22-ID at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL). A single crystal was cryoprotected in loop containing the cystallant solution plus 20% glycerol and 4 mM GHRP, then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were processed with DENZO and ScalePack.16 The structure of rfD-B D432A GH was solved by molecular replacement using MolRep17 in CCP4i18 with one molecule of the normal recombinant fragment D structure, rfD (PDB code: 1LT9) as the search model. The solution gave a correlation coefficient and R-factor of 53.0% and 45.8%, respectively. The resulting model was improved by rigid body refinement in Refmac519 reserving 5% of the reflections for the calculation of the free R-factor. After one round of refinement, the model was improved

by manual fitting in the program O20 using sigmaA-weighted 2Fo Fc and Fo Fc electron density maps.21 Several cycles of restrained and individual temperature factor refinement were done before water molecules were added to complete the model. Furthermore, cis-peptide bonds were added at positions B 407 and 339. Final refinement was done with the TLS protocol in Refmac5.22 After all these refinement steps, the Rcrystal and Rfree converged to the values reported in Table 1. Thrombin-catalyzed polymerization Thrombin-catalyzed polymerization of B D432A was monitored as the turbidity changes at 350 nm using SpectraMax PC microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) essentially as described.24 Briefly, 10 L of 1 U/mL thrombin was added to reaction wells containing 90 L of 0.22 mg/mL fibrinogen in HBS with no added calcium and with CaCl2 at final concentrations of 10 M, 1 mM, and 10 mM. Polymerization was monitored for 60 minutes at room temperature. Three distinct parameters were analyzed: (1) the time it takes for the absorbance to rise above zero (lag time); (2) the portion of the curve with the steepest slope after the absorbance starts to rise (Vmax); and (3) the final maximum absorbance (ODmax). Scanning electron microscopy Fibrin clot and specimen preparations were based on a previously described method with some modifications.24 For each polymerization condition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on 2 clots each with 2 separate microscopy preparations for normal and B D432A. Clots were polymerized in microtiter plate wells at 0.5 mg/mL fibrinogen and 0.4 U/mL batroxobin or thrombin in HBS and 1 mM CaCl2 for 2 hours. The clots were then fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde overnight, rinsed 3 times with HBS, then dehydrated with a series of ethanol solutions (20%-100%). The samples were then critical-point dried in a Balzers CPD020 (Oerlikon Balzers, Balzers, Liechtenstein), mounted, sputter-coated with approximately 20 nm gold-palladium, and viewed on a Zeiss Supra 25 FESEM (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY). All images were taken at 50 200 magnification, with a 3.0-mm working distance and 4.99-kV

reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol followed by heating at 100°C. Sample components were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. Densitometric analyses of stained gels were performed using the gel analysis tools in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health [NIH], Bethesda, MD) and - /B ratios were calculated. Statistical analysis The statistical significance of differences between normal control and variant fibrinogen was determined using unpaired t tests. A difference was considered significant when the P value was less than .05.

Structure of rfD-B D432A GH

Figure 1. Comparison of polymerization holes "b." Structures of (A) rfDB D432A GH and (B) normal with both GPRP and GHRP (rfD BOTH). For both structures, the difference electron density Fo Fc is contoured at 3.0 and is shown in green. The 2Fo Fc electron density maps are contoured at 1.0 shown in gray. Clear positive difference electron density for GHRP is evident in hole "b" of normal rfD BOTH and is absent in the rfD-B D432A GH structure. This suggests that B D432A has an impaired hole "b" and does not bind the peptide. Note the positions of B Glu397 and B Asp398. In normal rfD BOTH, both residues flip toward hole "b" to interact with GHRP. In rfD-B D432A GH, these residues are nowhere near hole "b."

Factor XIIIa­catalyzed cross-linking of fibrin Factor XIII (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) was activated with human -thrombin for 60 minutes at 37°C in HBS with 5 mM CaCl2. To examine the cross-linking of fibrin, fibrinogen (5 g), in HBS and 5 mM CaCl2, was incubated at 37°C with a mixture of FXIIIa (3.3 U/mL) and human -thrombin (0.07 U/mL). To examine the cross-linking of batroxobincatalyzed fibrin, hirudin (10 U/mL) was added to the thrombin-activated FXIIIa before incubation with fibrinogen and batroxobin (0.08 U/mL). The

To understand the molecular basis for the normal turbidity of B D432A, we determined the crystal structure of fragment D from this variant, crystallized in the presence of GHRP. We obtained high-quality diffraction data and were able to solve the structure to 2.4 Å. A total of 643 amino acid residues in one fragment D molecule ( 134-190, 161-458, and 105-392) can be elucidated clearly from the electron density. The substitution of the Asp to Ala at position B 432 was evident. Alignment of the C atoms in normal and B D432A fragment D showed excellent agreement with RMSD of 0.75 Å, demonstrating that the global structure of rfD-B D432A GH was not changed by the alanine substitution. Surprisingly, the structure of rfD-B D432A GH showed that GHRP is not bound to hole "b." As shown in Figure 1A, there was no electron density in 2Fo Fc and Fo Fc maps for the peptide in hole "b." Moreover, the structure of hole "b" in rfDB D432A GH is reminiscent of the structure of normal recombinant fragment D in the absence of peptides (rfD). We did see GHRP bound in hole "a" (Figure 2). Thus, rfD-B D432A GH structure resembled that of rfD-B D398A GH, the structure of another variant with mutation in hole "b," B D398A, crystallized in the presence of GHRP. The rfD-B D398A GH structure showed that GHRP was not bound to hole "b" but was bound to hole "a" in the -chain forming noncanonical "B:a" interactions.10 As with the rfD-B D398A GH structure, comparison of the 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit of rfD-B D432A GH showed 2 different structures for the 2 "B:a" interactions with calcium present in the 2 site in only one of the molecules (Figure 2). The 2 calcium is located in the 294-301 loop, which is in close proximity to hole "a." This calcium binding site has also been observed in structures of normal fragment D and its cross-linked form,25 as well as in recombinant rfD-B D398A GH,10 when the proteins were crystallized in the presence of GHRP alone. Studies with recombinant

observed in the structures of normal fragment D, crystallized in the presence of peptides, rfD BOTH (Figure 3B), causes B Glu397 and B Asp398 to flip toward B Asp432 to interact with the peptide.5,25 Because B Asp398 is part of the 2 calcium coordination, movement of B Glu397 and B Asp398 causes the disruption of the 2 site upon peptide binding. In rfD-B D432A GH, peptide binding to hole "b" is lost, hence, the calcium is present in the 2 site.
Thrombin-catalyzed polymerization of B D432A

Because the loss of "B:b" interactions appeared inconsistent with our prior findings, we re-evaluated the polymerization of this variant. Thrombin-catalyzed polymerization experiments were performed as described before10 and carried out at 3 calcium concentrations: 10 M CaCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM CaCl2. Consistent with previous data, the variant B D432A was indistinguishable from normal fibrinogen for essentially all parameters examined (Table S1, available on the Blood website; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article). All polymerization parameters for B D432A (lag time, Vmax, and ODmax) were not significantly different compared with normal, with the exception of the lag time at 10 mM CaCl2 in which B D432A had a longer lag time (P .01). To confirm that the final turbidity was indicative of fiber thickness and to quantitate the differences in fiber thickness, we examined thrombin- and batroxobin-catalyzed fibrin clots using scanning electron microscopy. Consistent with our turbidity data, clots formed from B D432A have similar fiber diameters as those formed from normal fibrinogen (Figure S1). For the clots formed using thrombin, we found the average fiber diameter for B D432A was 84 plus or minus 18 nm, which was essentially similar to normal with an average fiber diameter of 83 plus or minus 18 nm (P .8). The batroxobin-derived clots for B D432A had fiber diameter of 68 plus or minus 13 nm, which was comparable with those of normal with average fiber diameter of 66 plus or minus 15 nm (P .7). However, batroxobin-derived clots for either B D432A or normal had significantly thinner fiber diameter compared with the thrombin-derived clots (P .03 for B D432Aand P .04 for normal), suggesting that FpB cleavage modulates fiber diameter.
FXIIIa-catalyzed cross-linking
Figure 3. Conformational change with peptide bound in hole "b." Structures of rfD-B D432A GH (A) and rfD BOTH (normal fibrinogen with both GPRP and GHRP; B) are shown. Residues involved in 2 calcium and peptide binding are shown as pink sticks. Note the conformational change in residues B 397Glu and B 398Asp when peptide (shown as blue sticks) is bound to hole "b," as in the case of normal. In the rfD-B D432A GH structure, hole "b" does not bind the peptide so that B 398Asp, together with 132Glu, coordinates the 2 calcium (shown as orange sphere) that tethers the C-module to the coiled coil.

fibrinogen D298,301A showed modest impairment in polymerization, suggesting that 2 does not significantly modulate polymerization.26
Calcium binding in crystal structure

It is well known from crystal structures that fragment D has a high-affinity calcium binding site in the -chain, designated as 1. Another calcium binding site that is analogous to 1, is located at an equivalent position in the -chain adjacent to hole "b," designated as 1. Both the 1 and 1 calcium binding sites are present in the rfD-B D432A GH structure (Figure 3A). An additional calcium binding site, designated as 2, which is located near the junction of the C-module and the coiled-coil region, is also seen in rfD-B D432A GH. This calcium ion anchors the C-module to the coiled-coil region and is coordinated by the side chains of B Asp398, B Asp261, Glu132, and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of B Gly263.3,5 Binding of peptide to hole "b," as

In recent studies, we concluded that "B:b" interactions promote protofibril assembly.9,27,28 FXIIIa-catalyzed - dimers form early in polymerization, likely as soon as protofibrils are present.29 We therefore analyzed the kinetics of - dimer formation because this could reflect subtle differences in protofibril formation between normal and B D432A. Analysis of thrombin-catalyzed FXIIIa cross-linking showed - dimer formation after 2 minutes in both normal and B D432A (Figure 4A,B). These - dimer bands increased in intensity with longer incubation times (Figure 4C). We also performed experiments in the presence of FXIIIa and batroxobin. Similar to thrombin-catalyzed polymerization and cross-linking, the - dimer bands were weakly evident in both normal and B D432A after 2 minutes (Figure 4D,E). With longer incubation, these - dimer bands increased in intensity (Figure 4F). These data indicate that protofibril formation was not delayed for B D432A, suggesting that protofibril formation in B D432A is not markedly different from normal.

Discussion
Our structural data showed GHRP does not bind to hole "b" in B D432A. Hence, the variant lacks "B:b" interactions. Our biochemical data, which corroborate and extend previous studies,

Figure 4. FXIIIa cross-linking of B D432A and normal recombinant fibrinogen. Cross-linking was examined by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Fibrinogen (5 g) was incubated with either FXIIIa and thrombin at final concentrations of 3.3 U/mL and 0.07 U/mL, respectively (A: normal, B: B D432A) or FXIIIa and batroxobin at final concentrations of 3.3 U/mL and 0.08 U/mL, respectively (D: normal, E: B D432A). The samples were incubated for 0 minutes (lane 1), 2 minutes (lane 2), 5 minutes (lane 3), 10 minutes (lane 4), 20 minutes (lane 5), 40 minutes (lane 6), 1 hour (lane 7), and 2 hours (lane 8). Data were analyzed by determining the ratio of dimers to B -chain by densitometry and are plotted against time (thrombin-polymerized; C: f indicates normal; , B D432A; and batroxobin-polymerized: F: F indicates normal; E, B D432A).

showed polymerization, fiber diameter, and FXIIIa cross-linking of B D432A were indistinguishable from normal. These findings are remarkable because they show that formation of cross-linked clots is normal even in the absence of "B:b" interactions. This then raises the question: Do "B:b" interactions actually occur in fibrin; and if they do, are they critical for fibrin clot formation? Thirty years ago, Blomback et al showed that fibers obtained from ¨ reptilase, which cleaves predominantly FpA, have lower mass-to-length ratio than those derived from thrombin.30 They then proposed a 2-step sequence of events in fibrin polymerization where protofibril formation mediated by "A:a" interactions is followed by lateral aggregation of the protofibrils through "B:b" interactions. Subsequent studies by Weisel31 and Hantgan et al32 showed the extent of lateral aggregation was greater for fibers with cleavage of both fibrinopeptides; the addition of thrombin after activation with reptilase, at a time when protofibrils have formed, caused rapid fiber formation. These studies demonstrated that the release of FpB, exposing knob "B," has a marked impact, supporting the idea that "B:b" interactions are important in lateral aggregation. Nevertheless, several observations, including these studies, suggest otherwise. Even though the snake venom enzymes cleave only FpA, they still produce normal-looking fibers, albeit thinner in diameter. Thus, protofibrils are formed and these protofibrils are capable of lateral aggregation even in the absence of "B:b" interactions.31 The knob "A" peptide mimic, GPRP, has been shown to inhibit polymerization,33 whereas knob "B" peptide mimic GHRP does not.34 In fact, GHRP and other knob "B" peptide analogs enhance turbidity during thrombin-catalyzed polymerization.35 Thus, "B:b" interactions are not essential for lateral aggregation. More recent studies proposed a role for "B:b" interactions in protofibril formation. These studies examined polymerization of single-substituted recombinant fibrinogens, D318A and D320A, which have changes in the high-affinity calcium binding site,27 and D364V, D364H, and D364A, which have changes in hole "a."9 These variants did not polymerize with batroxobin, indicating complete

loss of "A:a" interactions. They did, however, polymerize with thrombin, although with markedly delayed kinetics. This thrombin-induced polymer formation was inhibited by GHRP, suggesting that "B:b" interactions support protofibril formation, at least in the absence of normal "A:a" interactions. With normal "A:a" interactions, as seen with reptilase, the subsequent addition of thrombin might stabilize protofibrils, and consequently enhance fiber formation. In contrast to the previous reports, our results with B D432A suggest "B:b" interactions are not critical for normal polymerization. To reconcile these differences, we propose that the loss of FpB, rather than the gain of "B:b" interactions, influences polymerization. Because FpB is electronegative, diminished electrostatic repulsion between associating fibrin molecules can be surmised after cleavage of FpB. Although the removal of the 2 FpAs reduces the negative charge, it is only after FpB release that the central domain actually assumes a net positive charge to favor association with the negatively charged D nodules. Aside from electrostatic factors, FpB also modulates fibrinogen structure through intramolecular interactions with the C domains.36 After FpB release, the C domains dissociate so they are free to form intermolecular associations enhancing lateral aggregation.36,37 These findings suggest the role of FpB in modulating polymerization, whereas our data indicate that actual occupancy of hole "b" is not critical to fibrin clot formation. Although hole "b" may have only very little influence on polymerization, recent data indicate that "B:b" interactions play a more important role in fibrinolysis.35 Previous studies have suggested that a consequence of "B:b" interactions may be a global conformational change where the 2 calcium anchor is disrupted and the C-module disengages from the coiled coil.5 The resulting conformation may lead to increased accessibility to a tPA (or plasminogen) binding site at 148-160 (Figure 3B) when binding of the tethered knob to hole "b" locks and prevents the C-module from retreating back toward the coiled-coil region.38 Indeed,

addition of free, untethered knob "B" peptide mimics that can compete with the authentic tethered knob resulted in a delay in fibrinolysis. Our data from our experiments using B D432A and the peptide AHRPY, which exclusively binds to hole "b," are consistent with this observation (S.R.B., Brian Holliday, and S.T.L., unpublished findings, February 2008). In summary, we have shown that B 432Asp is critical for peptide binding. However, the normal polymerization of B D432A despite absence of "B:b" interactions suggests that occupancy of hole "b" may have little impact on polymerization. It may be that FpB release and electrostatic factors are more critical than actual "B:b" knob-hole binding.
