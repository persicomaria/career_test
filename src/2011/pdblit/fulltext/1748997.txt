The crystal structure of a complex between DNase I and the self-complementary octamer duplex d(GGTATACC), has been solved using the molecular replacement method and refined to a crystallographic R-factor of l88o/o for all data between 6.0 and 2.3 A resolution. In contrast to the structure of the DNase I-d(GCGATCGC)2 complex solved previously, the DNA remains uncleaved in the crystal. The general architecture of the two complexes is highly similar. DNase I binds in the minor groove of a right-handed DNA duplex, and to the phosphate backbones on either side over five base-pairs, resulting in a widening of the minor groove and a concurrent bend of the DNA away from the bound enzyme. There is very little change in the structure of the DNase I on binding the substrate. Many other features of the interaction are conserved in the two complexes, in particular the stacking of a deoxyribose group of the DNA onto the side-chain of a tyrosine residue (Y76), which affects the DNA conformation and the binding of an arginine side-chain in the minor groove. Although the structures of the DNA molecules appear at first sight rather similar, detailed analysis reveals some differences that may explain the relative resistance of the d(GGTATACC), duplex to cleavage by DNase I: whilst some backbone parameters are characteristic of a B-conformation, the spatial orientation of the base-pairs in the d(GGTATACC), duplex is close to that generally observed in A-DNA. These results further support the hypothesis that the minor-groove width and depth and the intrinsic flexibility of DNA are the most important parameters affecting the interaction. The disposition of residues around the scissile phosphate group suggests that two histidine residues, H134 and H252, are involved in catalysis.

account fully for the difference in cleavage rates. In our attempt to understand the structural basis of the sequence-dependent interaction, we have crystallized and solved the structure of a nicked octanucleotide d(GCGATCGC), (Octa I) bound to DNase I at a resolution of 2.0 A (1 A = 01 nm), details of which are published (Suck et al., 1988; Lahm & Suck, 1991). In this complex, DNase I binds in the minor groove of a B-type DNA duplex via an exposed loop around residue tyrosine 76, and positively charged or hydrophilic residues interact with several phosphate groups on both strands of the helix, with contacts extending over six basepairs. Very little change takes place in the DNase I upon binding of the substrate compared to the refined enzyme structure (Suck & Oefner, 1986). In the complex, the minor groove is widened to about 15 A and a concurrent 20" bend of the DNA away from the protein and towards the major groove suggests that in addition to groove width, the variation of flexibility is another important factor determining the cleavage rates. The DNA also exhibits considerable local distortions, the most pronounced of which is caused by the stacking of a deoxyribose ring of the DNA onto the side-chain of tyrosine 76 leading to an unusual backbone conformation in one strand and an abnormal base-stacking interaction
with the following base-pair.

Here, we report the crystal structure of DNase I complexed with the remarkably cleavageresistant self-complementary octamer duplex d(GGTATACC)2 (Octa VT) refined at 2.3 A resolution. In contrast to the previously reported structure, the DNA remains uncleaved in the crystal and the interaction of the scissile phosphodiester bond with the protein is clearly visible in the electron density. The general architecture of the complex is conserved in a different crystal environment (including the tyrosine-deoxyribose stacking interaction), although there are some differences in the structure of the DNA.

2. Experimental
(a) Cry&allization ad data collection DNase I from Worthington was purified by phosphate gradient desorption from hydroxylapatite-coated gel beads (HA-Ultrogel, Pharmacia) and ion-exchange chromatography (F.P.L.C. Mono-Q, Pharmacia). Pure protein (single band on SDS/polyacrylamide gels) was dialysed into 5 mM-Hepes buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mM-CaCl,, 65 mM-NaN,, shock frozen and stored at -20°C until oligonucleotide use. The self-complementary 5'-d(GGTATACC) was synthesized by the phosphoramidite method on an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer at 1.0 pM scale, purification on DEAE 52 ion exchange resin yielding typically 1.2 mg of pure oligonucleotide. Equal volumes of protein solution at 39 mg/ml (1.3 mM) and oligonucleotide at 10 mM were mixed in the

presence of 20 mm-EDTA. Crystals were grown at 20°C using the hanging-drop vapour diffusion technique. Drops containing the protein and DNA were diluted with an equal volume from the reservoir on siliconized coverslips, mixed and inverted over the reservoirs. Reservoirs contained 63 m-NaCl, 20 mM-EDTA and 50 to 60% saturated sodium citrate as precipitant. The final concentration of the oligonucleotide in the drop was about 4 mM (for the single strand), i.e. an approximate 4-fold molar excess of the double-strand species over the enzyme. Plate-like crystals diffracting to about 23 A resolution grew within the nominal pH range 4.0 to 50 to approximate maximum dimensions of 93 mm x 92 mm x 903 mm. The presence of both protein and DNA was established by gel electrophoretic and high pressure liquid chromatography (H.P.L.C.) analysis of carefully washed, dissolved crystals. The crystals belong to space group P2,2,2 with cell dimensions a = 51.1 A, b = 1084 A, c = 62.1 A (as determined from X-ray precession photographs), the physically short crystal dimension corresponding to its c axis. Assuming that the asymmetric unit of the crystal contains one complex, a I', of 2.43 A/Da was calculated, which lies within the range of values usually encountered with protein crystals (Matthews. 1968). Intensity data were measured with the EMBL image plate device at the EMBL outstation, Hamburg, using the X-11 beam line at a wavelength of 996 A. A highexposure (8000 cts per 1.4" rotation frame) and a lowexposure (2000 cts per 2" rotation frame) dataset were collected using 1 crystal with the intention of using the latter dataset to measure the low-resolution reflections that were outside the dynamic range of the instrument at higher exposure. Reflection files were converted into a format suitable as input to standard oscillation film software. Following calculation of an orientation matrix and indexing of reflections with IDXREFS, Lorentz and polarization corrections were applied to integrated intensities produced by a modified version of the MOSFLM program suite. The 2 intensity datasets were merged and scaled using programs ROTAVATA and AGROVATA. All data were scaled using the 1st frame of the high-exposure dataset aa a reference, and using scale = 1.0 and temperature factor = @O. The high and lowexposure datasets were processed as 1 dataset giving a final R,,,,, of 7.6% for 12,681 unique fully recorded and summed partial reflections to 2.3 A, representing 78.6% of the theoretically measurable data (Table 1). Of the measured reflections, 796 o/o had a value of I greater than 3a,. (b) Molecular replacement

Structure factors were calculated for the refined coordinates of DNase I placed in a triclinic unit cell of dimensions 51.1 A x 1084 A x 62.1 A (the unknown cell). Only protein atoms of the DNase I were used for the calculation of the model structure factors. The Crowther fast rotation function (Crowther, 1972) program ALMN was used to calculate a cross-rotation function in Eulerian angles for resolution ranges 10 to 3 A, 8 to 4 A and 6 to 3 A on a 25" grid in fi. The number of reflections used in the calculation was varied by the application of a threshold intensity value. The upper and lower resolution limits in Patterson space were set at 6 A and 20 A, respectively, to minimize the contribution of cross-vectors. One i Unless otherwise stated, all programs used originate from the CCP4 program suite (CCP4, 1979).

consistent, unequivocal solution was represented by a peak averaging 41~. The position of the DNase I in the unit cell was determined using the Crowther and Blow T2 translation function as implemented by I. Tickle, in the program TFSGEN (Tickle, 1985). The correct solution, corresponding to a single large peak of 23a, yielded an R-factor of 40.1 y. for data from 10 to 3 A. Rigid-body refinement of the positioned DNase I model alone with the TNT refinement package (Tronrud et aZ., 1987) reduced the R-factor to 381 Oh.

(c) Model building

and refinement

Model building and manipulation was carried out on an Evans and Sutherland PS3QO colour graphics computer using a version of FRODO (Jones, 1978) as maintained at EMBL by J. Postma. Refinement of the model was carried out initially with the TNT program package, which is supplied with a dictionary containing stereochemical restraints for DNA residues. In the later stages of the refinement, an FFT version of PROLSQ (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980) was used that has been modified to accept DNA residues. The co-ordinates of an ideal B-form of d(GGTATACC), were generated from which the individual nucleotides were fitted into a 10 to 2.5 A 2F,- F, electron-density map calculated with the rigid body refined DNase I co-ordinates. The map showed clear density characteristic of double-stranded DNA running throughout the whole unit cell in the direction of the a-axis. The DNA molecules were stacked end-to-end in the manner of many other protein-DNA crystals. However, at this stage it proved impossible to fit all 8 base-pairs into the density, since the quality of the map around the 2-fold axis along c at a = 0, b = l/2 was poor, showing no convincing density for the C308. G309 basepair (for nomenclature, see Fig. 8(a)). At the other end of the DNA duplex, however, where the G301 `C316 basepairs of symmetry-related complexes stack across the 2-fold along c at a = l/2, b = l/2, the quality of the electron density was better. The current 2Fo-F, electron density map leads us to believe that the poor quality of the difference density at the former position, and the absence of any convincing density for C308 in the current 2F,- F, map is due to dynamic disorder in the crystal, particularly since some weak difference density persists near the expected Watson-Crick position of the cytidine residue (Fig. l(a)). However, modelling of a Watson-Crick bonded cytidine residue in this position in the final model indicates that the distance the backbone would be

required to bridge to the previous nucleotide (C307) makes this conformation untenable. Positional refinement therefore began using the TNT refinement package with 7 base-pairs included. All data were included from 10 to 25 A for the first 11 cycles, which brought the R-factor down from 351 y. to 255% with reasonable stereochemistry (r.m.s. deviation of bond lengths: 6039A). At this stage, electron-density maps indicated a position for the guanine residue of the omitted base-pair (G309) and some weak density in the expected position of a Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonded cytidine residue. Inclusion of the base-pair in the model and subsequent refinement resulted in improvement of the electron density representing G309, but no emergence of acceptable density for the cytidine residue (C308), which was therefore removed. During the 1st stage of refinement, no temperature-factor refinement was carried out, the temperature factors of DNase I atoms being those carried over in the co-ordinate file from the refined native DNase I structure. DNA atoms were assigned a temperature factor of 30 8'. In general, the refinement converged after 8 or 9 full cycles, at which point manual corrections to the structure of the DNA were made, as deemed necessary by inspection of 2F, - F, electron density maps and F,-- F, difference maps. In the next stage of the refinement, solvent sites were identified by superposition of strongly occupied solvent sites in the DNase I-Octa I structure and manual inspection of the Fo-- F, difference map. Solvent sites inferred from the previous structure that had no corresponding F, - F, difference peak were discarded. Subsequently, possible solvent occupied sites were identified by a modified version of the program PEAKMAX; in addition to identifying peaks in an F, - F, difference map, the modified program assesses their suit'ability as solvent sites by considering, firstly, their distance from all atoms of the current model, and then their distance from proton donor and acceptor atoms. Unsuitable candidates are removed from the output list. From this stage, positional and temperature-factor refinement were carried out alternately. Solvent molecules with temperature factors refining to more than 50 A2 were deleted from the model, as it was observed that these sites were rarely represented by a good quality peak in the 2F, - Fc electron density. Two N-acetylglucosamine residues of the carbohydrate moiety were also modelled. At this stage the crystallographic R-factor was 191 y. for all data between 6 and 2.4 A with fairly good stereochemistry (r.m.s. deviation of bond lengths = 0.023 A). Calculation of real space R-factors with the program 0 (Jones et al., lQQl), indicated that some protein residues

Inspection of the 2F, - Fc electron-density map showed that some of these residues were in regions of relatively weak electron density, whilst others were possibly incorrectly positioned. Additionally, there were some features in the electron-density map that could not be accounted for by the model. In an attempt to resolve their correct arrangement, positional refinement was performed with

Refinement of partial models was carried out with PROLSQ following refinement of the complete model to correct for the differences between the structure dictionaries of the 2 packages. At the start of the omit refinements, the crystallographic R-factor was 196% with very good stereochemistry (r.m.s. deviation of bond lengths = 0015 A). During the omit calculations, a 3a cutoff on F values was applied and the weight of the X-ray term was held at (F,- F,)/2. The omit procedure resulted in little improvement in the real space R-factors or the general map quality and did not indicate alternative side-chain conformations. As a final

3. Results and Discussion
(a) Crystal packing In the DNase I-Octa V crystals, continuous endto-end stacks of octamer duplexes are formed along the a-axis through crystallographic dyads located between the blunt ends of the DNA molecules (Fig. 4(a)). Although this arrangement is a common feature crystalline protein-DNA complexes (Anderson et al., 1987; Jordan & Pabo, 1988; Wolberger et al., 1988; Pavlevitch & Pabo, 1991), it was not found in the DNase I-O&a I co-crystals of

with an r.m.s. deviation of 660 A, for all atoms excluding residues 98 to 107 (Fig. 5). In the complexes, apart from residues 58 to 60, where the electron density is weak, there are no significant differences in the paths taken by the backbones of the molecules. R9 shows a large side-chain movement resulting from a 180" rotation around U-C atoms leaving the terminal nitrogen atoms pointing away from the deoxyribose group of nucleotide 314; however, the electron density for this side-chain is

Protein-protein contacts are confined to the a, c-plane, whereas protein-DNA contacts stabilize the crystal in the b-direction (Fig. 4(b)). In the DNase I-Octa V crystals, the rods of DNA are separated by solvent channels parallel to the a-axis. Intermolecular contacts are listed in Table 4. The two complexes compared here exist in distinctly different crystallographic environments. However, in both cases only terminal residues of the DNA are involved in symmetry contacts. It has been proposed that crystal-packing forces have a minimal effect on helical parameters involving bases, but may significantly affect observed backbone conformations in crystals of nucleic acids (Dickerson et al., 1987; Heinemann & Alings, 1991). Since the only contacts to DNA backbone atoms in this complex are from the bound DNase I, we expect to find crystal-induced distortions confined to terminal residues of the DNA.

H121 is rotated 160" around the c"-Cs bond returning almost to its conformation in the native enzyme structure. This difference is readily explained by the absence of the stacking interaction between H121 and the terminal 5'-guanosine residue

The co-ordinates of the protein part of the DNase I-Octa I structure (broken lines) and those of the substrate-free enzyme (light lines) were superimposed onto the protein part of the DNase I-Octa V structure (bold lines) using backbone atoms (N, C, 0, C", Cp) only. Residue segments l-97 and 108-260 were used for the calculations. The structures superimpose with r.m.s. deviations of 928 A and 639 A for DNase I-Octa I onto DNase I-Octa V and DNase I onto DNase I-Octa V, respectively. For all atoms, the r.m.s. deviations are 067 A and 666 A. The movement of the exposed loop 73-77 in the substrate-bound enzymes compared to the substrate-free enzyme can be clearly seen.

present in the DNase I-Octa I complex. Differences observed in atomic positions of DNase I in the complex and the free enzyme are consistent with those previously encountered in the DNase IOcta I complex, in particular, the movement of the minor-groove-binding loop 73-76 (though Y76 shows a rather small shift) and changes in the helix-loop region 43-60, which is affected by crystal forces in the native structure. In overall terms, the enzyme conformation can be considered identical in both complexes. The two N-acetylglucosamine residues modelled are the only ordered part of the carbohydrate moiety. Two residues are visible, rather than one, as in the DNase I-Octa I complex, due to the interaction of the second residue with a symmetry-related DNase I molecule. However, the N-acetyl groups could not be fitted satisfactorily to the density. The large movement of the side-chain of E244 compared to the free enzyme structure may be due to a clash with the nearby sugar group. Due

to the presence of excess EDTA, the structural calcium sites are not occupied. This leads to high disorder in the loop 98-107, which is therefore not included in the current model. In the loop 203-207, the calcium ion is replaced by a water molecule. Most of the buried water molecules observed in the free enzyme structure are present here. The majority of the remaining 77 water molecules modelled are in the first hydration shell of the protein, which is not complete, whilst the DNA exhibits very little observable hydration. The average isotropic temperature factors (Fig. 6) of the protein in the Octa V complex are considerably higher than in the DNase I-Octa I complex (28.3 A2 and 16.2 A2, respectively). When the structures are normalized to the same overall temperature factor, protein residues in contact with the DNA show slightly lower or very similar B-factors compared to the substrate free enzyme as is the case in the DNase I-Octa I complex.

The horizontal scale is increased for the DNA part. The bases of the DNA are treated as main-chain atoms, the backbone as side-chain, since the backbone is more flexible. The values for the protein show a similar distribution to those in the DNase I-Octa I complex (Lahm & Suck, 1991), although the average of 28.3 A2 (compared to 162 A') is much higher in this complex. Average values for the DNA, water and the whole complex are 33.3 A', 383 A2 and 31.2 A', respectively, compared to 302 A', 383 A' and 21.3 A2 for the DNase I-Octa I complex.

(c) General architecture of the complex The overall mode of binding of the enzyme to the DNA is the same in the DNase I-Octa V and the previously determined Octa I complex, despite different crystallization conditions (sodium citrate wersus polyethyleneglycol SOOO),packing arrangements and base sequences (Fig. 8). Contacts are made by main-chain and side-chain protein atoms to phosphate groups of both strands and in the minor groove on one side of the DNA double helix (Table 5, Fig. 7). No contacts occur in the major groove. A salt bridge and several hydrogen bonds involving protein side-chains are formed with four phosphate groups of the scissile DNA strand. Backbone NH-groups are interacting with two

phosphate groups of the opposite strand. The small number of water-mediated contacts are listed in Table 6. As in the DNase I-Octa I complex, Y76 is involved in a stacking-type contact with the deoxyribose group of thymidine 313, thereby inducing an unusual translgauche conformation around its C4'-C5' and C5'-05 bonds (Fig, 9) and a nearly complete overlap of the thymine base with the following adenine base (A312) (see this base step in Fig. 12). This appears to be a characteristic feature of the DNase I-DNA interaction, although a similar backbone conformation has been observed in another protein-DNA complex (Jordan & Pabo, 1988). The major difference in the contact patterns of the two complexes is related to the scissile phosphate group (P315), which is present in the DNase I-Octa V complex, but was absent from the DNase I-Octa I crystals. This phosphate group forms tight interactions with the side-chains of H134, D168, N170 and H252 (a possible mechanism is discussed below). The absence of the scissile phosphate group will naturally have some effect on the local DNA conformation and may be responsible, together with crystal-packing effects, for the differences observed at the phosphate group 3' to the cleavage site. The slightly different orientation of the side-chain of R41 in the two complexes might explain why this residue interacts only with the 02 position of thymidine 305 in Octa V and not with the following base (Fig. 10). As in the DNase IOcta I complex, the interaction of R41 in the minor groove would be sterically hindered by a G. C basepair at this position, three base-pairs from the cleavage site. The absence of the interaction of the El3 imino group with the phosphate group of 306 is probably due to differences in the DNA conformation. R9, which we expected to form a salt bridge with the scissile phosphate group and which we believe may contribute to the catalysis (see below), is not resolved beyond Cy. However: as mentioned

Figure 7. (a) Stereo overview of the DNase I-Octa V complex. One asymmetric unit of the crystal unit cell is shown with the symmetry-related DNA molecule at I- X, 1 - Y, 2. Residues contacting the DNA are shown, with a C" atom representation of the rest of the protein. Contacts are restricted to the minor groove and the phosphate backbones of the DNA. Although the 16.mer DNA shown is not a continuous helix, it is sufficiently close to the expected B-DNA structure to show the position of the major groove with respect to a bound DNase I molecule. (b) Close-up view stereo plot of the contacts made by DNase I to the octamer duplex. R41 and Y76 bind in the minor groove, other residues bind to the backbone on either side. Additional contacts are made by H134, D168, N170 and H252 to the scissile phosphate group which was not present in the DNase ILOcta I complex. The missing base C308 is not well represented by electron density and is unmodelled (see the text).

above, the electron density is suggestive of two alternative positions: one toward the ribose of adenine 314 (as in DNase I-Octa I) and one 180" away. Rotation of the side-chain would allow it to interact with atoms around the scissile bond. (d) DNA
conformation

Over the preceding decade, the picture of a rigid, uniform, cylindrical DNA molecule has been dispelled (Dickerson, 1983; Shakked BE Rabinovich, 1986). More recent articles (Heinemann & Alings, 1989; Kennard & Hunter, 1991; Prive et al., 1991; Yanagi et al., 1991), relying on the crystallographically determined structures of oligonucleotides, have

shed more light on the relationship between the sequence and the local conformation of DNA. In order to cope with the irregularities present in both duplexes, we have used the CURVES algorithm (Lavery & Sklenar, 1988) to calculate overall helix axes over the respective intervals 301 to 307 (C308 of Octa V is not modelled and therefore this base-pair was omitted from both duplexes during the computations). The symmetry-related nucleotide units G301' and C302' were included in the analysis of the Octa I duplex; however, since there is no phosphodiester linkage from G301' to C314, care should be taken in interpreting the helix parameters for the first two base-pairs of Octa I.

duplex has been determined and found to adopt an A-family conformation in the crystal (Shakked et al., 1983); however, a nuclear magnetic resonance study (Zhou et al., 1987) suggests that in solution the GG and CC portions of this oligonucleotide assume a B-like structure, but the central TATA portion adopts the unusual "wrinkled D" (wD) structure. This is characterized by an eight basepair helical repeat, a narrower (effectively closed) minor groove, significant cross-strand hydrophobic interactions and alternating torsion angles at TA and AT steps.

We do not find any evidence of the alternating values of backbone torsion angles observed in the structure of nuclear magnetic resonance in the DNase I-O&a V complex d(GGTATACC), (Table 7). There are, however, two noteworthy deviations from normally observed torsion angle ranges in DNA: the change in the torsional angles Cl-C5'/C5'-05' at thymidine 313 from gaucheltrans to the unusual translgauche, as observed in the DNase I-Octa I structure, results from the interaction of the deoxyribose with the side-chain of Y76. An almost identical translgauche conformation

Figure 11. Graphs of DNA helical parameters plotted against sequence for Octa V and Octa I over the interval 301 to 307. C308 of Octa V is unmodelled; consequently, this base-pair was omitted from the calculations. The results were obtained using the CURVES algorithm (Lavery & Sklenar, 1988). Nomenclature conforms to that agreed at the EMBO workshop on DNA curvature and bending held at Churchill College, Cambridge, U.K. on 19-15 September 1988 (Sarma, 1988). Local parameters (i.e. those calculated purely with reference to the preceding base-pair and independently of any helix axis) are denoted by a capital D (Dy, Dz). The values of twist, roll and propeller twist given are also local parameters. Global parameters calculated with respect to an overall, curved helix axis are denoted by a small d (dx, dy). The small diagram to the upper right of each graph shows the movement associated with a positive value of the parameter with respect to the local helix axis system. The 5' to 3' sense is downward on the right of each diagram, the minor-groove dyad points out of the page. Parameters are plotted with respect to the 5' to 3' strand of increasing nucleotide number. The dot in the sequences of the 5' to 3' strands indicates the position (in the corresponding opposite strand) where the cut is made (Octa I) and where the scissile phosphate group is bonded to active-site residues (Octa V). The minor groove width is measured as the minimum interstrand phosphate group separation.

Each base-pair stack was aligned so that the local helix vector reference points obtained from the CURVES algorithm (Lavery & Skfenar, 1988) superimposed, resulting in a view along the 2 base-pair average helix axis vector, normal to the plane of the page. The upper labels at each side correspond to the top base-pair drawn with filled bonds. The unusual tram/gauche (C4'-C5'/C5'-05') backbone conformations at T313 and A314 are clearly seen. Note the alternating stacking pattern consisting of purine-pyrimidine steps with complete base overlap and pyrmidine-purine with almost no base overlap. An almost identical stacking pattern was found in the A-form crystal structure of d(GGTATACC), (Shakked et al., 1983). The arrow indicates the scissile P-03' bond. The absence of C308 from the model precludes the analysis of the C307C308 base-pair step.

is observed at cytidine 315, where it appears to be the result of the multiple interactions of the scissile phosphate with the active-site residues. The phosphate groups in both complexes almost exclusively adopt the B, conformation (E tram, [ gauche). The average intrastrand phosphate-phosphate distance of 6.5 A, mean rise per base-pair of 32 L% and low mean tilt of %6" in the Octa V duplex are indicative of a B-type conformation. However, the values of base-pair displacement from the helix axis (dx), which should be close to zero in a B-family DNA duplex are consistently and significantly high, averaging -2.5 a (Fig. 11(a)), resulting in a shallower minor groove. When viewed approximately along the helix axis, the DNA exhibits a central hole smaller than, but reminiscent of, canonical A-form DNA (Fig. 13). The similarly distributed but lower negative values of dx in Octa I do not produce this phenomenon. The correlation between average base-pair displacement from the helix axis (dx) and average base-pair longitudinal slide (Dy), as noted by Heinemann (1991), holds true for both duplexes but places Octa V ((dx) = -2.5; (Dy) = - 1.0) close to the values observed for the crystal structures of A-form helices. Octa I is placed

approximately halfway between the values for A-form and B-form helices by this criterion ((dx) = - 1.1; (Dy) = -0.5). These features, together with some aspects of the base-stacking patterns (see below and Fig. 12) and the predominance of C3'endo sugar pucker (Table 7), put the Octa V duplex close to the A-conformation and illustrate the difficulty in assigning short, distorted duplexes to a particular helix family. These observations also support the notion of the existence of a continuum of sequence-dependent helix conformations as opposed to clearly distinguished conformational states (Kennard & Hunter, 1991). The widening of the minor grooves (Fig. 11(b)), measured as the minimum interstrand phosphate-group separation to about 15 8, and the overall bending of about 95" in Octa V and 115" in Octa I over the truly equivalent interval 303 to 307 (Fig. 14), are the main, conserved global features induced by the interaction with DNase I. Certain features of the central TATA element of Octa V have also been observed in the atomic resolution crystal structure of d( GGCATATATGCG), (Yoon et aZ., 1988), having been predicted as characteristic of such alternating

sequences (Klug et al., 1979). The roll angles exhibit a distinct alternating pattern of high roll at the TA step and negligible roll at the AT step (Fig. 1 l(c)). This behaviour was also present in the A-form crystal structure of the d(GGTATACC)2 duplex (Shakked et al., 1983). The roll in Octa V is positively biased by the bending of the DNA, which results in the opening of the base-pairs toward the minor groove. In the straight alternating helix, the roll angles at successive base steps are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. In common with the reported X-ray structure of d(CGCATATATGCG)2, the central TATA portion of Octa V displays only moderate propeller twist. The pronounced alternating stacking pattern of the central GTATAC portion of Octa V is clearly sequence related. Viewed along the local dinucleotide helix axis, there is almost complete base overlap in purine-pyrimidine steps, whilst pyrimidine-purine steps show the characteristically poor overlap of bases (Fig. 12). The TA steps also

show inter-strand purine-purine overlap. An almost identical stacking pattern was found in the A-form crystal structure of d(GGTATACC)2 (Shakked et al., 1983) and, although less pronounced, a similar pattern occurs in the central TATA element of the B-form d(CGCATATATGCG)2 (Yoon et al., 1988). It would appear, therefore, that the observed stacking patterns are intrinsic features of the particular DNA sequences, with the exception of the complete overlaps at steps A312-T313 in Octa I and A304T305 in Octa V, which appear to be a consequence of the interaction with DNase I. Twist, slide (0~) and rise (Dz) values (Fig. 1 l(d) to (f)) follow a similar pattern in both duplexes. Twist and rise may be influenced by the action of the protein, since the sequences are not sufficiently related to expect them to exhibit a similar fine structure and do not conform to the patterns of behaviour observed by Yanagi et al. (1991). The twist pattern observed for Octa V does, however, agree with that observed in the crystal structure of

although the values are d(CGCATATATGCG),, more extreme. The low twist observed at C302G303 in Octa I was thought to be a consequence of the missing phosphate group and the formation of the quasi-continuous 14-mer; however, this step has a low twist in the intact Octa V duplex and may therefore result from the action of the protein. The roll angles in the Octa I duplex vary more smoothly; however, both duplexes have a high positive average for this parameter as a result of bending. There are too few examples of the base steps examined by Yanagi et al. (1991) to show a propensity for either high or low values of propeller twist to bear

bonded to carboxylate yups (H134-E78 and H252-D212) via their N' positions; accordingly, one expects their pK, values to be shifted about one unit higher (Perutz et al., 1985).

cross-strand hydrogen bonding (i.e. the donor-

mutants H134Q and H252Q implicate both residues in the mechanism (Worrall & Connolly, 1990; A. Worrall & B. Connolly, personal communication). Additionally, an E78T mutant shows only 2% of native activity (A. Worrall & B. Connolly, personal communication), suggesting that this residue supports the partially protonated state of H134 required for the proposed mechanism. At this

(e) Active site The cleavage of the P-03' bond by DNase I proceeds via inversion of configuration at the phosphorus group (Mehdi & Gerlt, 1984), suggesting that the hydrolysis involves an in-line nucleophilic attack by a water molecule opposite 03'. Following consideration of the three-dimensional structure of DNase I and the binding of Ca2+-thymidine3',5',-diphosphate, we proposed a mechanism involving a Glu-His pair (E78-H134) in the deprotonation of the attacking water molecule (Suck et al., 1984; Suck & Oefner, 1986). However, in the DNase I-Octa V complex, the scissile phosphate group is present and interacts with four protein side-chains (H134, D168, N170 and H252)

Figure 16. Schematic of a possible mechanism for the reaction performed by DNase I. From the disposition of the residues and assuming that the reaction involves an in-line attack at the phosphorus group by a water molecule, it seems most likely that HZ52 acts as a general base to abstract a proton from a water molecule opposite the 03' atom. The subsequent attack at the phosphorus group with inversion of its configuration gives rise to a penta-covalent transition state that may be stabilized by the metal ion and possibly by the side-chain of R9. H134 is in an ideal position to protonate the leaving 03'. The metal ion (double circle denoted M++) may also be important for the correct positioning of the phosphate group.

S. A. Weston et al. the major groove. The stiffness or flexibility of a given DNA sequence is therefore another important parameter affecting the cutting rates (Hogan et al., 1987; Lahm et al., 1991). Alternating poly d(AT) sequences do not show the conformational rigidity associated with homopolymeric poly d(A). d(T) sequences (Rhodes, 1979), suggesting that it is the combination of stiffness and narrowed minor groove of the latter sequences which makes them so resistant. The TATA element in the Octa V duplex shares some unusual features with the same element in the crystal structure of d(CGCATATATGCG)2 (Yoon et al., 1988) and the alternating B-structure proposed for poly d(A) .d(T) sequences (Klug et al., 1979). That these features are retained by a highly distorted protein-bound duplex indicates that they are an intrinsic and stable property of these alternating AT sequences. Of particular interest is the alternating stacking pattern, which exhibits very little base overlap, coupled to a high twist at TA steps and extensive overlap accompanied by low twist at the AT steps. It is likely that the pronounced preference of DNase I for cutting 5' to pyrimidine residues in alternating pyrimidinepurine sequences (Scheffler et al., 1968) is related to these conformational features. If cleavage occurs 5 to a pyrimidine residue, DNase I encounters a conformation, in particular, a twisting and stacking pattern, similar to that observed in the Octa I and Octa V complexes. If, on the other hand, the cut is 5' to a purine residue, the extensive overlap induced by DNase I between the bases two and three positions away from the cleavage point would occur at a pyrimidine-purine step, which shows just the opposite behaviour, namely, poor overlap and high twist, in the alternating structures. In other words, the alternating twist and stacking pattern is "out of register" with respect to the cleavage site when the cleavage site is 5' to a purine residue. At this point, we cannot exclude possible effects due to slightly different orientations of the phosphate groups at ApT and TpA steps. There is, however, no evidence for an alternating phosphate conformation in the Octa V duplex (Table 7). The parameter that sets the Octa V duplex apart from the d(CGCATATATGCG)2 structure and the identically bound Octa I duplex is the value of displacement dx of the base-pairs from the overall helix axis, which runs approximately along the floor of the major groove. Although the values of tilt, rise and twist are indicative of a B-conformation, the value of dx is found approximately half-way between the values found in canonical A and B-form DNAs (Fig. 11(a)). The tendency toward A-DNA-like displacement values will result in a shallower minor groove, thus reducing the efficiency of binding. It appears therefore that the remarkable resistance of the d(GGTATACC) duplex compared to Octa I and other octamers (G. Frost & D.S., unpublished results) is due to a narrower and shallower minor groove. The structure of the DNase I-Octa V complex

stage we cannot exclude a role for D168; however, at the pH optimum of the enzyme (7.9), this carboxylate will be negatively charged, making direct interaction with the phosphate group unlikely. The position of the catalytic metal ion was inferred by the superposition of the protein part of the DNase I-Ca 2+ -thymidine-3'5'-diphosphate structure onto the protein part of the DNase IOcta V complex. We have since gained independent evidence for this metal-ion-binding site from the crystal structure of a complex of DNase I with 02' methyl substituted GGUAUACC in the presence of Mn2+ (S.A.W. & D.S., unpublished results). Although the nucleic acid in this complex appears to be disordered, a position for the metal ion interacting directly with E39 is clearly indicated by a strong peak in the difference Fourier map. This position superimposes close to that derived from the Ca-pdTp complex. While further crystallographic and site-directed mutagenesis studies are required to elucidate the details of the catalytic mechanism of DNase I, the available data are in agreement with a general acidbase catalysis as outlined in Figure 16. One histidine residue (H252) acts as a general base, abstracting a proton from the attacking water, whilst a second histidine residue (H314) functions as a general acid, protonating the leaving 03'. The involvement of two histidine residues separated by about 5 A is reminiscent of the RNase A active site; however, the mechanisms of the two enzymes are unrelated and the remainder of their respective active site residues do not superimpose (Lahm & Suck, 1991). The metal ion, which is co-ordinated to the scissile phosphate group, E39 and possibly D251, stabilizes the penta-covalent transition state and correctly positions the phosphate group relative to the enzyme. Additionally, R9 may play a role in stabilizing the transition state.

4. Sequence-dependent

Cleavage by DNase I

Our previous assertion and that of others (Drew & Travers, 1984) that the minor groove width in a right-handed double-stranded DNA molecule is one of the most important global helix parameters determining the binding and, hence, the cutting rates of DNase I, is further supported by the structure described in this paper. The four base-pair sequence element TATA has been shown to adopt the narrow minor groove characteristic of poly d(A) *d(T) tracts (Nelson et al., 1987) and alternating d(AT) DNA sequences (Yoon et al., 1988; Zhou et al., 1987). Thus, the relative resistance of a short oligonucleotide containing this sequence element could be expected on the basis of steric hindrance to the insertion of R41 and Y76 in a narrower minor groove and the inability to form simultaneously the contacts to both DNA phosphate backbones. The widening of the minor groove by DNase I is accompanied by a bending of a similar magnitude in both complexes, away from the enzyme and toward

Structure of DNme I-d(GGTATACC), indicates that, in addition to minor-groove width and depth and DNA flexibility, the stacking and helix twist patterns are important, particularly in alternating sequences. The basis for the large variation in cutting rates at neighbouring phosphodiester bonds in mixed sequence DNA remains, however, largely unclear. Steric hindrance of the interaction of R41 in the minor groove by the 2-NH2 group of guanine bases may contribute to local variations of cleavage rates and, together with a reduced flexibility, may account for the lower than average
cleavage rates in GC-rich regions. We are indebted to the staff of the EMBL Outstation, Hamburg for their invaluable assistance with the data collection. We thank Drs C. Calladine and H.
