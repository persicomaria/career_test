The complex formed between anionic salmon trypsin (ST) and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) has been crystallised, and the X-ray structure has been solved using the molecular replacement method. The crystals are hexagonal and belong to space group P6122 with lattice parameters of a b ° ° ° 83.12 A and c 222.15 A. Data have been collected to 2.1 A and the structure has been refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 20.6%. Catalysis by salmon trypsin is distinguished by a Km value 20-fold lower than that for mammalian trypsins, and a kcat twice as high. The present ST-BPTI complex serves as a model for the Michaelis-Menten complex, and has been compared with corresponding bovine and rat trypsin (RT) complexes. The binding of BPTI to salmon trypsin is characterised by stronger primary interactions in the active site, and a somewhat looser secondary binding. Keywords : trypsin; serine proteinases; cold adaptation; inhibitor; substrate specificity.

It is a general belief that organisms living in cold environments have compensated for reduced catalytic rates at low temperatures by evolutionary adaptation of existing enzymes. Enzymes from cold-adapted species tend to have a higher catalytic efficiencies (measured by the kcat/Km ratio) than their mammalian counterparts [1 7]. It is further believed that the increased efficiency is caused by a higher flexibility of the enzyme at the expense of reduced temperature and pH stability [8, 9]. This is probably due to a reduced number and weakening of several non-covalent intramolecular interactions. Anionic trypsin from the Atlantic salmon is found to catalyse some reactions up to 40 times more efficiently than the mammalian counterparts [10]. This is primarily due to an increase in the substrate affinity (20fold decrease in Km), but also by a twofold increase in the turnover number (kcat). Salmon trypsin (ST) and bovine trypsin (BT) have been thoroughly studied, both by comparing the crystal structures [11] and by molecular-dynamics simulations [12], but no clear structural explanation for the differences in catalytic efficiencies was found. The dynamic simulations did not indicate differences in overall dynamics motion, but significant differences were found for particular regions. The reduced Km for the cold-adapted salmon trypsin indicates that the binding of a substrate in the active site plays an important role in catalysis. However, Perona et al. [13] have found that deacylation is rate limiting for catalysis of tripeptides in rat trypsin (RT). This suggests that the rate

at which the hydrolysed product can be removed from the enzyme is important; thus, interactions formed between the enzyme and the residues on the C-terminal side of the inhibitor scissile bond may be of particular interest. The amino acid sequence identity between salmon and bovine trypsins is 65%, and is 67% between salmon and rat trypsins. Only one amino acid is different in the S3 S4 (nomenclature of Schechter and Berger [14]) binding region. Residue 217 is tyrosine in salmon and bovine trypsin, but serine in bovine trypsin. Residues 97 99 of trypsin, which form contacts to residue 39 of the secondary binding loop of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), are all different in the three trypsins and may influence the binding of a substrate. The present form of ST is anionic (pI ~4.7), while the bovine counterpart is cationic [10]. The rat trypsin is also anionic according to the sequence [15]. Not only is the overall charge different between the three trypsins, but even more pronounced are the differences in distribution of charged residues. The charge of the N-terminal halves is virtually identical for the three enzymes, while there is a large difference in the C-domains. There is a difference in eight point charges between salmon and bovine trypsin, and five point charges between salmon and rat trypsin. The RT has the most negative net charge, while the BT has a positive net charge. Since the C-terminal domains comprise the specificity pocket, a more negative charge in this region is likely to affect substrate affinity and binding. The BPTI in complex with trypsin has been used as a model for studying the Michaelis-Menten complex in trypsin catalysis. BPTI makes an extremely strong association with both bovine and salmon trypsins in the 1012 1013 M 1 range (Otlewski, J. unpublished results), but due to the strong binding, differences in association constants for the two complexes have been difficult to resolve. Crystal structures of the complex with trypsin from two mammalian sources have been reported ; BT-BPTI [16] and mutated [D189G/G226D]RT-BPTI [17]. The present study on the salmon trypsin complex is performed to look for possible

structural differences that might explain the higher affinity for positively charged substrates. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Crystallisation and data collection. Anionic trypsin from salmon was purified from pancreatic extract as described by Outzen et al. [10]. BPTI was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. The complex between inhibitor and enzyme was formed by mixing the components at a 3: 1 molar ratio, yielding a final protein concentration of 27 mg/ml. The complex was crystallised using the hanging-drop vapour diffusion method. The sparse matrix of Jancarik and Kim [18] was used for initial screening of crystallisation conditions. Three different conditions gave identical crystals: (a) 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5, and 0.8 1.2 M potassium sodium tartrate; (b) 0.1 M acetate, pH 4.6, and 1.8 2.0 M sodium formate; (c) 0.1 M cacodylate, pH 6.4, 0.2 M magnesium acetate and 30% MPD. The crystals diffract up to ° 2.1 A, and are of the hexagonal space group P6 122, with cell ° ° constants a b 83.12 A and c 222.15 A. There is one complex molecule in the asymmetric unit, and the water content is about 60%. X-ray data (Table 1) were collected at the Swiss-Norwegian Beamline (BM01) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) on one crystal grown from condition (a) using a MAR image plate system (Mar Research). Data were integrated using the software DENZO [19, 20]. Scaling and merging was carried out using SCALA and AGROVATA of the CCP4 program suite [21]. Molecular replacement. The structure of the ST-BPTI complex was solved by molecular replacement using X-PLOR [22]. The search model was the co-ordinates of the BT-BPTI complex, where the BT co-ordinates were replaced by the co-ordinates for

ST; protein data bank entries 2PTC and 2TBS, respectively [23 25]. Reflections with F 2F were used throughout the molecular replacement. Real-space Patterson rotation search was ° performed using data in the resolution range 15.0 4.0 A. One well-separated solution (5.3 over average and 1.0 over the second highest peak) was found at Eulerian angles 1 269.39; 2 79.64; and 3 9.07. Patterson correlation refinement, where the enzyme and inhibitor were treated as two individual rigid bodies, yielded a final correlation coefficient 5.2 times higher than the second highest peak from the rotation function. The translation search for the orientation of the model yielded one well-separated peak 27 over average and 10 over the second highest peak, at the translation vectors x 0.180, y 0.505 and z 0.955 in fractional co-ordinates. The rotated and translated model provided an R-value of 43.7% in the resolution ° range 8.0 2.5 A. Model building and refinement. The rotated and translated model served as the starting co-ordinates for the refinement of the ST-BPTI complex. Data where F exceeded F were used throughout the refinement. Rigid body refinement and simulated annealing using X-PLOR [22] brought the initial R-factor of 44.3% (Rfree 45.5%) down to 27.0% (Rfree 35.3%). Further improvement of the model was achieved by alternate cycles of rebuilding using the interactive graphics program O [26], and subsequent conventional positional refinement and individual B-factor refinement, resulting in an R factor of 20.6% and free R- factor of 23.8%. The models were rebuilt on the basis of 2Fo Fc and Fo Fc electron-density maps. The refinement ° data were gradually extended to 2.1 A, and 10% of the data were kept out of refinement for cross validation [27]. Solvent molecules were added to the model where the difference density exceeded 4 and were within reasonable hydrogen-bonding dis° tances (3.4 A). In order to perform an unbiased judgement of the geometry of the reactive site, the energy terms of the inhibitor 15I-16I peptide bond were set to zero during refinement. The non-bonded energy terms for the atoms of the catalytic triad involved in proton transfer during catalysis were also set to zero. The final refinement statistics are listed in Table 1.

RESULTS General description. The electron density is, in general, well defined for both the trypsin and inhibitor parts of the complex. The mean co-ordinate error, estimated from a Luzatti plot [28], ° is about 0.22 A. The Ramachandran plots of ,  angles [29] show that almost 90% of the non-glycine residues fall within

Asp236 and Lys26I. The refined average B-factor of all atoms ° is about 37 A2 for the ST-BPTI complex (Table 1), which correspond reasonably well with the Wilson B-factor from scaling of the data set. The high average B-factor is probably the reason why relatively few water molecules (87) could be interpreted in well-defined electron density. Trial inclusions of additional water molecules reduced the conventional R factor, but the Rfree tended to increase. Structural comparison to other trypsin complexes. The complex formed between ST and BPTI was compared by leastsquares fitting to the BT-BPTI and RT-BPTI complexes and the benzamidine-inhibited ST and BT complexes, PDB entries 2PTC, 1BRB, 2TBS and 3PTB [17, 24, 25]. All main-chain atoms of trypsin, except for the autolysis loop residues 141 155, which fold differently in salmon trypsin, and residues 243 245 of the C-terminus were used for superpositioning. The average displacement was calculated for all trypsin main-chain atoms, all main-chain atoms of the specificity pocket (residues 189 193 and 214 220), and all atoms of the catalytic triad residues His57, Asp102 and Ser195 (Table 2). Average displacement was also calculated for all main-chain atoms of BPTI (residues 5 55), all main-chain atoms of the P3-P4 binding loop and for all atoms of the P1 lysine residue. The average differences in main-chain co-ordinate positions for the BPTI com° ° plexes were 0.37 0.39 A for the enzyme parts, and 0.34 A for the inhibitor parts, with lower values for the specificity pocket and the catalytic triad atoms. These differences are in the same order as among other trypsin structures [11, 31]. Regions that ° appear with peaks higher than 0.5 A are all in surface regions and are probably caused by packing interactions. However, some segments of salmon trypsin polypeptide deviate from the fold of bovine trypsin. The orientation of these regions is well conserved among salmon trypsins in complex with BPTI, benzamidine and trypsin inhibitors from squash seeds and, thus, represents small, but real differences between the fish trypsin and the mammalian trypsin. Apart from BT autolysis loop, these regions include residues 22 27 in the N-terminal loop (nomenclature by Heimstad [32]), residues 60 63 in the N3-N4 loop, residue 115 117 in the inter-domain loop, residues 235 237 in the C-terminal helix and residue 174 and residue 178 in the CA1-

the most favourable regions of the plot. The remaining residues lie within the additional allowed regions as defined in PROCHECK [30]. Regions where the density is weak are generally in loop regions exposed to solvent. The main chain of anionic salmon trypsin can be traced with continuous density from the N-terminus to residue 242, but with complete lack of density for the last three residues of the C-terminus. This is a feature observed for other salmon trypsin structures [25, 31]. The inhibitor main chain can be continuously traced from the N-terminal to residue 56I, but with weak density for the first two residues. This is in contrast to the BT-BPTI complex, where no density is observed for the first two residues (according to the PDB file) on the inhibitor N-terminal, but where residues 57I and 58I are defined. Four residues have side chains refined with multiple conformations; Val63, Met175, Ser240 and Met52I. Only four side chains are completely missing from electron density; Arg62, Tyr97,

The N  atom of P1 lysine contacts the carboxylate group of Asp189 through one direct hydrogen bond to O 2 and through a water molecule to O1. Five hydrogen bonds, which all contact the inhibitor main chain, are conserved in the secondary binding sites of all three complexes. Two are on the Nterminal side of the scissile bond, and three on the C-terminal side. Additional hydrogen bonds are formed between inhibitor side chains and the enyme (see Table 4 for further details). The figure was prepared using BOBSCRIPT [33, 34]. ° Table 3.

C3 loop. These folding discrepancies are most likely an effect caused by differences in the amino acid sequence. Regions with large average displacement are often accompanied by high temperature factors. The average main-chain Bfactors for the three trypsin BPTI complexes were put on the same scale, and from this residual main-chain B-factors were calculated (Fig. 1). Four regions in salmon trypsin have Bfactors that are significantly higher than bovine and rat trypsins. The largest difference is observed for the C-terminal helix (residues 233 242), but also the N2-N3 loop (residues 49 51), the N5 strand and parts of the N5-N6 loop (residues 83 97), parts of N6 strand and the inter-domain loop (residues 106 112). The relatively high mobility of the N5-N6 loop is probably caused by lack of interactions with the highly flexible C-terminal helix. The ST CA1 helix has temperature factors lower than those found in BT and RT. The loops flanking this

helix in BT-BPTI are more flexible than in the salmon and rat trypsin complexes. The calcium-binding loop of ST also has Bfactors lower than the BT. All these differences are most likely caused by packing interactions. The flexibility of the main-chain atoms of the specificity pocket varies among the three trypsins. The lowest temperature factors are observed for the ST complex, and the highest values for BT-BPTI. The segment from residue 189 to 193 in RT-BPTI has B-factors only slightly higher than ST-BPTI, but the other segment lining the pocket (residues 214 220) is more in the order of BT-BPTI. These differences cannot be accounted for solely by packing interactions, but could be due to differences in inhibitor binding. Temperature factors for the inhibitor main chain and the side chain of Lys15I were also calculated (Fig. 1b). Both the main-chain atoms of the bind-

ing loop (P3-P4) and the P1 lysine side chain have considerably lower B-factors in the ST complex than in the mammalian com° ° plexes (ST-BPTI 17.85 A2 ; BT-BPTI 22.54 A2 and RT° BPTI 33.89 A2, relative B-factors for the side chain). This coincides with the B-factors observed for the specificity pockets. Enzyme-inhibitor contacts. The BT-BPTI and ST-BPTI complexes form about 130 enzyme-inhibitor contacts shorter than ° 4.0 A, and the RT complex forms 122 contacts. The number of such contacts on the C-terminal side of the reactive Lys15I residue is 54 for the salmon and rat trypsin complexes and 59 for the bovine trypsin complex. There are 16 protein-protein hydrogen bonds in BT-BPTI and ST-BPTI, and 15 hydrogen bonds in RT-BPTI. The primary residue accounts for nine of those in the ST complex and seven in BT-BPTI and RT-BPTI. The number of van der Waals contacts is identical for the P1 residue in the bovine and salmon trypsin complexes (six contacts), and one less in rat trypsin-BPTI. The number of hydrogen bonds on the C-terminal side of the scissile bond is seven in BT-BPTI, six in RT-BPTI and five in ST-BPTI. The secondary binding sites of the two anionic trypsin complexes are also involved in more van der Waals contacts than for BT-BPTI. Superposition of the enzyme part of the three complexes reveals a different tilt of BPTI in all complexes (Fig. 2) [33, 34], where the orientation of the ST complex is more similar to RT-BPTI than BT-BPTI. The differences in buried surface area upon complex formation between the salmon trypsin and the mammalian trypsins are small, and probably do not contribute significantly to differences in binding affinity. The decrease in water-accessible surface area ° of ST upon complex formation is 600 A2, corresponding to a reduction of 6.3 % compared with the uncomplexed enzyme. The corresponding reduction in water-accessible surface area of the

° ° bovine and rat trypsins is 640 A2 (7.0%) and 650 A2 (7.0 %), respectively. Primary binding. The Lys15I N atom at the bottom of the pocket forms a hydrogen bond directly to Asp189 O2 in STBPTI (Fig. 3, Table 3) [33, 34], and not only through a water molecule as in BT-BPTI and RT-BPTI [17]. A corresponding hydrogen bond is, however, observed for bovine trypsin in complex with the trypsin inhibitor from the squash seed of Cucurbita pepo (unpublished results) and for bovine trypsin in complex with an engineered subtilisin inhibitor [35]. An additional hydrogen bond is formed between the amide nitrogen of the inhibitor P1 residue and 214 O of ST. This hydrogen bond is also observed for rat trypsin in complex with BPTI [17]. The hydrogen bonds from P1 N and P1 N are all shorter in the salmon trypsin complex. In contrast to RT-BPTI, no distortion of the geometry around the scissile carbonyl carbon atom is observed in ST-BPTI. Secondary binding. Most of the hydrogen bonds in the secondary binding region are formed by the residues on the C-terminal side of the scissile bond. Only two enzyme-inhibitor hydrogen bonds are formed prior to the inhibitor reactive site in all three complexes, and with slightly varying distances for the P3 O 216 N bond (Table 4). Amino acids on the C-terminal side of the reactive residue form three hydrogen bonds, which are conserved in all three complexes, and have approximate similar distances. Two additional hydrogen bonds between residue 39I of the inhibitor and 97 O are found in the bovine and salmon trypsin complexes. The side chain of Arg17I (P2) in BPTI forms an additional two hydrogen bonds to the backbone of residue 40 in BT, and to the side chain of Glu151 in RT. Reactive-site geometry. The orientation of the catalytic triad is generally well conserved for all trypsin-inhibitor complexes

The imidazole ring of His57, and the carboxylate of Asp102 of bovine trypsin (green) seems to be slightly rotated relative to the orientations found for salmon (red) and rat (blue) trypsins. All trypsin main-chain atoms, except for the autolysis loop residues 141 155, were used for superposition of the trypsins. The figure was prepared using BOBSCRIPT [33, 34].

° about 5 A2 lower for RT. However, the imidazole group of His57 ° in BT-BPTI has a relative B-factor of 34 A2, whereas the salmon ° and rat trypsin complexes have B-factors of about 20 A2. The unconstrained refinement of the inhibitor 15I-16I peptide did not result in any out-of-plane distortion, but, as found for other proteinase-inhibitor complexes [36], the distance between the carbonyl carbon atom of the scissile bond and the hydroxyl group of Ser195 is in between a covalent O C bond and a normal van ° der Waals distance. The Ser195 O-Lys15I C distance of 2.61 A in ST-BPTI is, however, in the same order as that for the BT° BPTI complex, while it is 2.8 A in RT-BPTI (Table 5). It should be noted, though, that the differences observed could be a result of different refinement protocols, particularly since all nonbonded energy terms of the catalytic triad atoms involved in proton transfer are switched off in the refinement of the salmon trypsin complex. Water in the contact region. Both BT-BPTI and ST-BPTI complexes have six water molecules, which act as bridges between the inhibitor and the enzyme (Table 6). Of the three conserved water molecules, two are found at the bottom of the specificity pocket. Both solvent molecules bind to the bovine and salmon trypsin complexes, with approximately similar distances to the enzyme and inhibitor. OW 1 and OW 2 do not bind to the inhibitor of RT-BPTI due to the rotation of Lys15I N, which is caused by two mutations at Asp189 and Gly226 [D189G/G226D]. Solvent molecule OW 4 is found at equivalent positions in all three complexes, but distances vary due to the slightly different tilt of the inhibitor (Fig. 2). The tilt also increases the distance between the N-terminal domain of the enzyme and the inhibitor and, thus, causes OW 7 and OW 8 to be highly disordered in ST-BPTI and RT-BPTI. The water molecules OW 5 and OW 6 in ST-BPTI seem to replace the contacts that the side chain of Arg17I forms in BT-BPTI and RT-BPTI. DISCUSSION Intramolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts in the enzyme-inhibitor contact region do not reveal many clear structural differences to explain the increased catalytic efficiency of salmon trypsin. Variations in intramolecular distances are generally of the same order, or less than the estimated co-ordi° nate error (0.2 A). However, some differences are observed, as the number of hydrogen bonds and other close contacts formed in the primary and secondary binding sites are not equally distributed in the three complexes. The ST complex has two hydrogen bonds in the primary binding site which are not found in

[24]. This is the case also for the three trypsins in complex with BPTI and benzamidine (Table 5 and Fig. 4) [33, 34]. The hydroxyl group of Ser195 in the BPTI complexes is slightly rotated relative to the benzamidine complexes, and forms shorter contacts to the side chain of His57. Both the imidazole ring of His57 and the carboxylate group of Asp102 in BT-BPTI seem to be rotated relative to the other trypsin-inhibitor complexes, so that both carboxyl oxygen atoms can form hydrogen bonds to His57 N1. It also seems that His57 is more flexible in BT-BPTI than in the other complexes. The B-factors for Asp102 and Ser195 are in the same order for the bovine and salmon trypsins (about ° ° 30 A2 and 20 A2, relative B-factors, respectively), with values

Fig. 5. Electrostatic surface potentials of trypsins. Electrostatic potential of the surfaces of salmon (left), bovine (middle) and rat (right) trypsins. Potentials are taken from the PDB files. The P3-P4 binding loops of BPTI illustrates the binding of Lys15I in the specificity pockets and the different orientations of the Arg17I side chain (to the right). The figure also shows that the binding cleft of salmon trypsin is more open than for the mammalian enzymes due to the different fold of the autolysis loop. The figure was prepared using GRASP [37].

BT-BPTI. The bond that is formed between the amide nitrogen of Lys15I and Ser214 O is also observed in the RT-BPTI complex. Of greater importance is probably the hydrogen bond formed directly between P1 N and Asp189 O2. In order to accommodate the more bulky side chain of Tyr217, small rearrangements of the main-chain positions of residues 217 and 219 in salmon and rat trypsins have to take place. This results in a slightly more shallow specificity pocket and, hence, a stronger primary binding. The higher affinity of BPTI to salmon trypsin may also be verified by lower B-factors for the inhibitor binding loop and the specificity pocket. A direct comparison of the primary binding of BPTI to RT is more difficult as the P1 N atom is rotated due to the D189G/ G226D mutations. As the primary binding region is identical for bovine, rat and salmon trypsins, with the exception of Tyr217, which is a serine in bovine trypsin, it is reasonable to believe that the secondary binding regions play an important role in substrate affinity. On the N-terminal side of the scissile bond, residue Arg39I of the inhibitor seems to be an important stabilising agent as the side chain may form several contacts to the carbonyl oxygen of trypsin residue 97. The amino acid sequence of the loop from residue 97 to residue 99 are different in all three trypsins, resulting in a hydrophobic loop in ST, a loop with a slightly negative potential in BT, and a positive potential in RT (region to the left of the inhibitor binding loop in Fig. 5) [37]. Met175 in ST forces the guanido group of Arg39I to form very close contacts to the carbonyl oxygen of Tyr97. Residue 175 is lysine in RT, and is probably the reason why the positively charged Arg39I does not bind to the enzyme at all. According to Kurth et al. [38] RT prefers positively charged P2 residues, and the interaction between the carbonyl oxygen atom of the Phe41 and the amide nitrogen atom of P2 is one of the most important backbone-backbone interactions of the S sites [39]. The additional stabilising effect of the P2 arginine side chain seems to be important for the bovine and rat trypsin complexes. The side chain of residue 17I forms several hydrogen bonds to the trypsins, but binds to different parts of the enzyme surface. In the BT complex, the fold of Tyr151 pushes Arg17I towards residue 40 of the N-terminal domain, whereas it binds to the side chain of Glu151 in the C-terminal domain of RT. The different fold of the segment 141 155, and the lack of Tyr151 in salmon trypsin leaves Arg17I in a more solvent-exposed environment and reduces the strength of the P2-S2 bind-

ing. In this case, both amines of the guanido group of inhibitor residue 17I in ST-BPTI are stabilised by hydrogen bonds (about ° 3.2 A) to 27I O of a symmetry related molecule. The different fold of the autolysis loop in salmon trypsin also results in a wider binding cleft (Fig. 5), which may facilitate the entrance of a substrate to the active site, and the exit of the hydrolysed product. Both P1 and P3 of the inhibitor are hydrophobic residues (Ala and Ile, respectively), and are in the vicinity of the positively charged Lys60 of the enzyme. As the fold of the segment from positions 59 to 63 in the fish enzyme is different from the mammalian trypsins, the energetically unfavourable P1 and P3 interactions are reduced in the ST complex. There is no significant deviation in the orientation of the backbone of the P3-P2 binding loop in the three trypsins. However, significant differences are observed in the more distal regions of BPTI. As for RT-BPTI, the inhibitor in ST-BPTI is tilted more towards the Cterminal domain of trypsin (Fig. 2). For RT, this may be explained by the binding of Arg17I to Glu151. As the P2 side chain in the salmon trypsin complex does not form any contacts to the enzyme surface, the tilt is more likely caused by electrostatic interactions, by packing interactions, or by both. In order to sum up, it seems likely that the charge distribution of the enzyme surface is a major determinant for the higher affinity for positively charged substrates to salmon trypsin. The overall negative potential on the C-terminal domain of the fish enzyme is probably taking part in directing the positively charged substrate to the active site. Fewer hydrogen bonds, and more polar nonpolar interactions on the C-terminal side of the scissile bond in the salmon trypsin complex may facilitate the removal of a hydrolysed substrate. The small, but real differences in the trypsin main-chain fold found for several regions are most likely an effect of differences in the amino acid sequence. Whether this contributes to the enhanced kinetic efficiency of salmon trypsin, is yet not known.
