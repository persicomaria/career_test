Embryonic mouse molars were grown on a semi-solid medium supplemented with 2 mM p-D-xylopyranoside (@xyloside), a specific inhibitor of proteoglycan synthesis. The induced glycosaminoglycan depletion in the extracelhdar matrix was monitored by hmnunohistochemistry employing monoclonal antibodies to chondroitin 4- and chondroitin bsulfates. g-Xyloside inhibited formation of the dental bell and delayed the appearance of the first odontoblasts. Odontoblast functional differentiation proceeded in the absence of chondroitin sulfate in the basement membrane. Predentin secreted in the presence of i!Lxyloside triggered the polarization of ameloblasts, but did not allow the maintenance of polarized odontoblasts. These results support the hypothesis that, in the tooth germ, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans participate in the regulation of cell kinetic-dependent morphogenesis (Mark et al., 1990. Differentiation 43,37-50). On the other hand, the possibility that chondroitin sulfate might play a role in odontoblast terminal differentiation is definitively ruled out.

Introduction

Odontogenesis and cytodifferentiation of odontoblasts and ameloblasts involve a chain of reciprocal interactive events between the dental papilla, of mesectodermal origin, and the dental epithelium which is derived from the oral epithelium (Thesleff and Hurmerinta, 1981; Ruth et al., 1983). Through these continuous epithelialmesenchymal interactions, the primordium of the

enamel organ progresses from the dental lamina stage through bud, cap and bell stages to the formation of crown and roots. There is considerable experimental evidence, from tissue cultures, that these epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, governing odontogenesis, are mediated mainly by stage-specific extracellular matrices (ECMs) (Thesleff and Hurmerinta, 1981; Ruth et al., 1983). Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG), a major family of non-fibrous macromolecules found in the ECM of connective tissues, have been implicated in the control of a variety of cell activities during embryogenesis (Ruoslahti, 1988, 1989). In previous immunohistochemical studies (Mark et al., 1990 a, b), we have used monoclonal antibod-

ies (Mabs) specific for chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4-S) and for chondroitin B-sulfate (C6-S) to investigate the distribution of CSPG of differing sulfation patterns during odontogenesis in the mouse. It was found that CSPG bearing 6-sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains and 4-sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains, respectively, were expressed in the ECM, each according to a specific temporospatial pattern. C4-S was associated with the basement membrane connecting the dental epithelium and the dental mesenchyme from the onset of tooth morphogenesis to the completion of odontoblast terminal differentiation, but was not detected in the dental papilla prior to the beginning of cusp formation. Predentin, a product of functional odontoblasts, was rich in C4-S. C6-S was detected in the dental mesenchyme as early as the bud stage, but it disappeared progressively from the mesenchyme of the cusps. The basement membrane of the tooth was essentially devoid of C6-S and the predentin was always C6-S-negative. A striking positive correlation was noted between the distribution of C6-S and the gradient of mitosis along the antero-posterior axis of the continuously growing mouse incisor (Osman and Ruth, 1976). In contrast, C4-S distribution antagonized this gradient. Furthermore, C6-S disappeared from the odontoblastic cell lineage at least 24 h before the onset of odontoblast terminal differentiation, whereas C4-S was abundant in the ECM surrounding all preodontoblasts and, similarly to fibronectin, was redistributed at the apical pole of polarizing odontoblasts. From these observations it was suggested that changes in the sulfation pattern of CSPG might be involved in the regulation of cell-kinetic-dependent morphogenesis and in the control of odontoblast terminal differentiation. Many investigations have employed chemical agents such as L-azetidine (Ruth et al., 1974), diazo-oxo-norleucine (Hurmerinta et al., 1979; Hurmerinta and Thesleff, 1982; Olive and Ruth, 1982), tunicamycin (Thesleff and Pratt, 1980 a, b) or vitamin A (Hurmerinta et al., 1980) which alter the metabolism of ECM-macromolecules for the purpose of elucidating their role in odontogenesis. Agents interfering specifically with the activity of CS sulfotransferases are not available. However,

j?-xyloside which selectively inhibits the synthesis of proteoglycans (Schwartz et al., 1974), provides a valuable tool to approach the biological functions of these molecules during development. In this study, we have analysed the effects of P-xyloside on tooth morphogenesis and on cytodifferentiation of odontoblasts and ameloblasts, in vitro. These effects were correlated with CS deposition in the tooth ECM by means of immunohistochemical methods employing specific anti-CS Mabs.
Materials and Methods Organ cultures

Lower first molars were dissected from Swiss mouse fetuses killed on day 14, 16, 17 or 18 (vaginal plug = day 0). The tooth germs were cultured for 2,4, 6 or 8 days either in the absence or in the presence of 2 mM /3-xyloside ( p-nitrophenyl B-D-xylopyranoside; Koch-Light, Haverhill, U.K.), on a semi-solid medium. This medium consisted of RPMI-1640 supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum, L-glutamine (2 mM), kanamycin (100 pg/ml) and ascorbic acid (180 pg/ml). The latter was dissolved immediately before use. Two milliliters of the culture medium, gelified by 0.5% Agar (Bacto Agar, Difco, Detroit, MI, U.S.A.) were added to plastic Petri dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark; 35 x 10 mm). The teeth (4-5 per dish) were grown at the surface of the semisolid medium. Cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO, in air. Every other day, 20 ~1 of ascorbic acid, freshly dissolved in the medium, was added on top of each germ. Control cultures were grown either on medium containing 2 mM of p-nitrophenyl-cu-Dxylopyranoside (a-xyloside; Koch-Light) or on xyloside-free medium. An average of 16-20 germs, 8-10 in /3-xyloside supplemented medium, the other 8-10 in control medium, were used in each experiment.
Enzymatic removal of the basement membrane

Dental papillae and enamel organs from day 18 molars were incubated in 1% trypsin (Difco 1: 250) in Hanks balanced salt solution for 1.5 h at 4O C, then mechanically separated (Ruth et al., 1976).

This results in removal of the basement membrane (Osman and Ruth, 1981). The two tissues were then recombined and cultured for 2 or 4 days, either in the presence or absence of P-xyloside.
Histological procedures

fibronectin antibodies (diluted 1: 50; Cappel, West Chester, PA, U.S.A.) followed by fluorescein-conjugated anti-goat IgG (diluted 1: 50; Cappel).

Immunohistochemical procedures

Cultured teeth were fixed in acid-alcohol at 4 o C for a minimum of 1 h, embedded in Paraplast (Monoject Scientific, Kildare, Ireland) and serially sectioned at 5 pm. Deparaffinized sections were rehydrated, digested with chondroitinase ABC in the presence of proteinase inhibitors according to Oike et al. (1980), then incubated with anti-CS Mabs: the Mab 2B6 is an IgG identifying C4-S; the Mab 3B3 is an IgM identifying C6-S. Both Mabs react with the glycosaminoglycan stub left on the CSPG core protein after chondroitinask ABC digestion (Couchman et al., 1984; Caterson et al., 1985). Areas of the histological sections which reacted with the Mabs were subsequently visualized using either indirect immunofluorescence (for 2B6) or immunoperoxidase (for 3B3). Details of these immunostaining procedures have been published elsewere (Mark et al., 1990b). Negative controls of the immunostaining procedures were performed as follows: lB5, a monoclonal IgG specific for (unsulfated) chondroitin (Couchman et al., 1984; Caterson et al., 1985) and which does not react with dental tissues in situ (Mark et al., 1990a, b), served as a negative control of the immunostaining by 2B6. MC21B, a monoclonal IgM not related to CS (Mark et al., 1989,1990b), was used as a negative control of the immunostaining by 3B3. In another set of negative controls, chondroitinase ABC digestion of the histological sections, prior to immunostaining, was omitted (Mark et al., 1990b). In some experiments histological sections from cultured molars were digested with chondroitinase ABC then incubated with goat anti-rabbit

First lower molars explanted at day 14 are either at the bud stage or at the initial cap stage of development. After 4 days of culture in the presence of cY-xyloside, all eight explants had reached the bell stage (Fig. la); after 6 days, eight out of nine explants showed well developed cusps with polarized odontoblasts (Fig. lc); after 8 days, all eight explants contained predentin. In the presence of /3-xyloside, only one out of ten and two out of nine explants had reached the bell stage after 4 and 6 days in culture, respectively. Furthermore, between the 2nd and 6th day of culture (Fig. lb and d), the relative volume of the dental mesenchyme decreased considerably, but cell necrosis was not observed. During the same period, the enamel organ expanded by proliferation of the stratum reticulum although histogenesis could not proceed normally: this was indicated by the absence of stratum intermedium from all explants after 6 days (Fig. Id). After 8 days, all eight explants had degenerated in the form of epithelial cysts (not shown). Functional odontoblasts were never observed. The effect of /3-xyloside on morphogenesis was still partially reversible when the explants were transferred to xyloside-free medium after 4 days of culture (Fig. 2a and b). Ten days after transfer, predentin secretion and ameloblast polarization was observed in four out of eight explants (Fig. 2a). In these explants cuspal morphogenesis was well advanced. The other four explants had degenerated and formed cysts containing mainly epithelial cells (Fig. 2b).

did not affect cusp formation (Fig. 3a and c); odontoblast and ameloblast differentiation occurred after 4 and 6 days of culture, respectively, as expected from previous data (review: Ahmad and Ruth, 1988; Table I); a well-defined stratum intermedium was already observed after 2 days in all ten explants (not shown). In the presence of P-xyloside, cuspal development was hampered: after 4 and 6 days the feature of the cusps was the same as at the onset of the culture in more than half of the explants and, on the whole, cuspal morphogenesis was always retarded (Fig. 3b and d). &Xyloside also affected the histogenesis of the enamel organ: formation of the stratum intermedium was not observed after 2 days of culture in any of the 10 explants. Moreover, in the intercuspal area, histogenesis of the inner dental epithelium was inhibited and the stratum intermedium never formed in this area (compare Fig. 4a and 4b). /3-Xyloside did not prevent odontoblast polarization, predentin secretion or ameloblast polarization, but these events occurred with a 48-h delay in comparison with control cultures (Table I and Fig. 5a-f). Moreover, the final number of odontoblasts was significantly decreased.

Morphological observations: recombined tooth components

Incubation of embryonic molars in trypsin solution followed by mechanical dissociation of enamel organ and dental papilla results in removal of the basement membrane (Osman and Ruth, 1981). After recombination of day-18 enamel organ and dental papilla a new basement membrane (lamina densa) is deposited within 18 h (Meyer et al., 1978). In the presence of either (Y-or /3-xyloside, the polarizing odontoblasts present at the tip of the main cusps at the time of tissue dissociation, continued to polarize and secreted predentin after 2 days (Fig. 6a and b). Furthermore, in the presence of P-xyloside, a well-defined gradient of odontoblast cell differentiation was observed, indicating that new preodontoblasts were entering the process of terminal differentiation (not shown). However, after 4 days in &xyloside supplemented medium, the odontoblasts facing ameloblasts were always depolarized (compare Fig. 6d, P-xyloside, with Fig. 6c, cy-xyloside); in these regions of the tooth germ the thickness of the predentin remained unchanged between the 2nd and 4th day in culture (compare Fig. 6d and Fig. 6b).

Day 17 molars

Day 17 first lower molars contain preodontoblasts engaged in the last cell cycle at the tip of the principal group of cusps. These cells were polarized after 2 days of culture in the presence of cy-xyloside (Table I). On the other hand, odontoblasts were observed only in two out of nine of the contralateral molars cultured for the same period in the presence of P-xyloside (Table I).

Immunostaining data

The distribution patterns of C4-S and of C6-S, in tooth germs that were cultured in the presence of a-xyloside or in xyloside-free medium, were superimposable to those observed, at comparable developmental stages, in vivo (Mark et al., 1990b; see example Fig. 8a and b).

After 2 days in the presence of &xyloside, the staining intensities produced after incubation with 3B3 (anti-C6-S Mab) and 2B6 (anti-C4-S Mab) were considerably reduced in both dental papilla and basement membrane (see example Fig. 7a and b); after 4 days, immunostaining of these structures was nearly abolished (compare Fig. 8a and b, cY-xyloside, with Fig. 8c and d, /I-xyloside). Molars from day 16, cultured for 6 days in the presence of b-xyloside showed intense immunostaining reaction over the predentin secreted by fully polarized odontoblasts and this despite the absence of C4-S and C6-S in the dental papilla,

xyloside-free medium, bright fluorescent staining with 2B6 was observed in the basement membrane after 7 h (Fig. 10a); after 24 h, C4-S was also consistently detected in the cuspal mesenchyme (Fig. lob). Under the same culture conditions, immunostaining with 3B3 was not recovered after 24 h (Fig. 10~) and was still faint after 2 days (not shown).
Distribution of fibronectin in CS-depleted explants

P-xyloside-induced CS depletion of the tooth ECMs (compare Fig. lla and c) did not affect the distribution of fibronectin (compare Fig. llb and d): in day 16 explants and recombined day 18 tooth tissues, cultured in the presence of the inhibitor for 6 and 2 days, respectively, intense fluorescent staining with anti-fibronectin antibodies was observed in the dental papilla, in the basement membrane and in the predentin (Fig. lld), despite the absence of CS from these structures (Fig. 11~).

Discussion

P-Xyloside is a known inhibitor of morphogenesis: it inhibits branching morphogenesis in kidney and salivary glands from fetal mouse (Thompson and Spooner, 1982; Platt et al., 1987) and disrupts feather pattern formation in chick embryo skin (Goetinck and Carlone, 1988). P-Xyloside is an artificial primer for glycosaminoglycan chain initiation: it competes with the xylosited proteoglycan core proteins at the level of the glycosyl transferase which adds galactose to the xylose residues on the core protein. Despite

the theoretical feasibility of P-xyloside to act as primer for both CS and heparan sulfate synthesis, many investigations seem to prove that P-xyloside is a poor or inactive substrate for the assembly of heparan sulfate chains (Johnston and Keller, 1979; Robinson and Lindahl, 1981; Spooncer et al., 1983; Platt et al., 1987; Piepkom et al., 1989; Hamati et al., 1989). However, the possibility that the structure of heparan sulfate proteoglycans may be affected by the xyloside treatment cannot be ruled out. /3-Xyloside appears to be specific in action (Schwartz et al., 1974). Treatment of cells with /3-xyloside not only inhibits the synthesis of secreted proteoglycans but also induces a large stimulation of CS (dermatan sulfate) synthesis which is found in the culture medium and is not associated with the cells or ECM (Spooncer et al., 1983; Thompson and Spooner, 1983; Platt et al., 1987; Goetinck and Carlone, 1988; Hamati et al., 1989; Bansal et al., 1989). Several observations indicate that the inhibition of proteoglycan deposition in the ECM and not the presence of large amounts of free glycosaminoglycan chains in the culture medium accounts for the morphological effects of the drug (Thompson and Spooner, 1983; Klein et al., 1989; Hamati et al., 1989).

Effect of /3-xyloside on tooth morphogenesis

As a whole, odontogenesis is controlled by heterotypic-matrix mediated-cell interactions. The temporo-spatial pattern of matrix modulations, allowing for time and space specific cell-matrix interactions controlling successive developmental steps, might result from cell kinetic-dependent

phenotypic alterations of epithelial and mesenchymal cells (Ruth, 1984). P-Xyloside prevented formation of the dental bell in tooth germs from day 14. Four days of treatment were necessary to lead to obvious and often irreversible discrepancies between /3-xyloside-treated teeth and teeth cultured in control medium. Likewise, /%xyloside inhibited the development of the cusps in tooth germs from day 16. This was correlated with regression of the intercuspal area after 6 and 8 days of treatment. These morphological alterations were accompanied by a rapid disappearance of CSPG from the basement membrane and from the dental papilla. The toxicity of 2 mM of xyloside was ruled out by: (1) the absence of effect of cu-xyloside on tooth histomorphogenesis; (2) normal odontoblast differentiation and secretion of fibronectin in the dental papilla in the presence of P-xyloside; (3) reinitiation of CSPG deposition in explants that were depleted from CS after treatment with &xyloside; and (4) absence of pycnotic nuclei indicative of cell death. CSPG have been implicated in the regulation of cell division in vitro. For example, recombinant chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human decorin grow to a lower saturation density than control cells lacking this CSPG (Yamaguchi and Ruoslahti, 1988); also, treatment with /3-xyloside of rat aortic smooth muscle cells in culture inhibits postconfluent growth of these cells (Hamati et al., 1989). The effect of CSPG depletion of the

ECM on cell kinetics might be indirect, for instance by modifying the access to the cells of small diffusible molecules such as growth factors (review: Ruoslahti, 1989). The alterations induced by /3-xyloside are consistent with a decrease of cell proliferation in the dental papilla but not in the cells from the dental epithelium. Likewise, the partial lack of reversibility after 4 days of exposure to /3-xyloside might result from the persistent desynchronisation of epithelial and mesenchymal cell kinetics. In this context, it is interesting to note that the effect of P-xyloside on the expression of the 3B3-epitope (C6-S), which is associated with mitogenic areas of the tooth in vivo, is not rapidly reversible. Treatment with P-xyloside does not permit to approach, directly, the role of specific CS sulfotransferases in developing systems. The existence of a delay in the deposition of CS chains bearing 6-sulfated disaccharide units near their reducing end as compared to those bearing 4sulfated disaccharide units, in tooth germs returned to control medium after P-xyloside treatment, is interesting: it indicates that, under certain conditions, differences in CS sulfation patterns might be involved in the control of CSPG turnover.

the following steps: odontoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle, assume an epithelial morphology, polarize and secrete predentin (reviews Ruth et al., 1983; Ruth, 1984). Odontoblast terminal differentiation requires a minimal number of cell cycles and the presence of specific permissive signals endowed in a stage-specific basement membrane (Ruth et al., 1983; Ruth, 1984,1985) which contains C4-S (Mark et al., 1990 a, b). In our culture system, the appearance of the first polarized odontoblasts was delayed in the presence of P-xyloside, and the final number of odontoblasts was reduced in comparison with control cultures. This suggests that the drug either decreases the growth fraction or determines a lengthening of the generation time of the odontoblastic cell lineage. Changes in the distribution of C4-S and fibronectin during terminal differentiation of odontoblasts are identical (Mark et al., 1990a, b; Thesleff et al., 1979; Lesot et al., 1981). Fibronectin and C4-S surround preodontoblasts, then become restricted to the apical pole of polarizing odontoblasts. It has been suggested that the redistribution of fibronectin is causally related to odontoblast terminal differentiation (Lesot et al., 1988) and that specific CSPG(s) might be involved in fibronectin redistribution (Mark et al., 1990a, b). The results of this study rule out definitively this latter possibility: immunostaining patterns and intensity with anti-fibronectin antibodies on sections from cultured tooth germs were not affected by /I-xyloside treatment, whilst C4-S disappeared from the basement membrane. Functional differentiation of odontoblasts is characterized by amplification of collagen type I and type I trimer synthesis as well as supression of collagen type III synthesis (Munksgaard et al., 1978; Lesot and Ruth, 1979; Lesot, 1981; Lesot et al, 1981), the synthesis of phosphoproteins (MacDougall et al., 1985; Mark et al., 1988) and yacid-containing proteins carboxyglutamic (Bronckers et al., 1985). Our data demonstrate that functional differentiation of odontoblasts is also marked by an amplification of CSPG synthesis. This is evidenced by the possibility of preventing C4-S deposition in the initial predentin, but not in the predentin secreted by fully polarized odontoblasts with 2 mM P-xyloside.

In the presence of p-xyloside, functional odontoblasts subsequently depolarized. This was accompanied by a decrease in thickness of the predentin layer indicative of a decrease in production and/or of a resorption. A parallel can be drawn between these regressive changes of the odontoblasts, induced by /3-xyloside and those provoked by L-azetidine (Ruth et al., 1974) and ascorbate deficiency (Levenson and Schiltz, 1979). Terminal differentiation of ameloblasts requires contact between competent preameloblasts and the predentin (Karcher-Djuricic et al., 1985). Glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans present in the predentin do not appear to play a critical role in this process: inhibitors of protein glycosylation such as diazo-oxo-norleucine (Hurmerinta et al., 1979; Hurmerinta and Thesleff, 1982) and tunicamycin (Thesleff and Pratt, 1980a, b) do not prevent differentiation of ameloblasts if these agents are added after the initiation of predentin secretion. In the presence of P-xyloside ameloblast polarization proceeded whether the drug was added before or after the onset of odontoblast terminal differentiation, but always occurred in the presence of predentin.
