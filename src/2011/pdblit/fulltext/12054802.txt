Therefore, to exert pharmacological activity, these nucleoside analogs need to be efficiently phosphorylated to their monophosphate forms by UCK. Recently, two human UCKs with 69% sequence identity were reported: UCK1, composed of 277 amino acids, and UCK2, composed of 261 amino acids (Van Rompay et al., 2001; Koizumi et al., 2001). While their functional differences remain to be elucidated, the expression of UCK2 but not UCK1 was shown to be enhanced in human cancer cells, suggesting that UCK2 might contribute to the tumor-selective cytotoxicity of 3 -C-ethynylcytidine, a novel ribonucleoside analog especially effective against solid tumors, such as liver and pancreatic cancers (Hattori et al., 1996). There is supporting evidence that cancer cells resistant to 3 -C-ethynylcytidine have defects in UCK activity (Tabata et al., 1997). Thus, UCK is a target enzyme to design prodrugs for antitumor and antiviral activities. From its sequence homology, UCK has been suggested to belong to the nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) kinase fold family. The NMP kinase fold family has a conserved core structure of an / mononucleotide binding fold and is classified functionally into two groups, nucleic acid kinases and nonnucleic acid kinases referred to here as OH kinases. Nucleic acid kinases can be further divided into two groups, NMP kinases and nucleoside kinases. UCK and deoxyribonucleoside kinases belong to the latter group. OH kinases include various kinases such as shikimate kinase, gluconate kinase, and phosphoribulokinase, which phosphorylate the hydroxyl group of nonnucleic acid substrates. In this, OH kinases are similar to nucleoside kinases (nucleoside kinases are a subtype of OH kinases), while NMP kinases catalyze the reversible transfer of phosphate groups between two nucleotides. UCK has two features that are unique to other nucleic acid kinases in the NMP kinase fold family. One is its specificity for the sugar moiety of the substrate. Most NMP kinases and deoxyribonucleoside kinases do not strictly distinguish the ribose and 2 -deoxyribose forms of their substrates. However, UCK phosphorylates pyrimidine ribonucleosides, but never phosphorylates 2 -deoxyribonucleosides (Van Rompay et al., 2001; Koizumi et al., 2001). Second, UCK functions as a homotetramer and has been reported to be subject to feedback inhibition by UTP and CTP, and to be activated by ATP (Cheng et al., 1986; Ropp and Traut, 1998). In contrast, most NMP kinases function as monomers and are not subject to feedback inhibition. We determined the crystal structures of human UCK2 alone and in complex with the substrate Cyd, the feedback inhibitors CTP or UTP, and the phosphorylation products CMP and ADP. The structures of UCK in various complexed states offered the structural basis for the molecular mechanisms of substrate specificity, catalytic reactivity, and the regulation of UCK, and could contrib-

Summary Uridine-cytidine kinase (UCK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine and activates pharmacological ribonucleoside analogs. Here we present the crystal structures of human UCK alone and in complexes with a substrate, cytidine, a feedback inhibitor, CTP or UTP, and with phosphorylation products, CMP and ADP, respectively. Free UCK takes an / mononucleotide binding fold and exists as a homotetramer with 222 symmetry. Upon inhibitor binding, one loop region was loosened, causing the UCK tetramer to be distorted. Upon cytidine binding, a large induced fit was observed at the uridine/cytidine binding site, which endows UCK with a strict specificity for pyrimidine ribonucleosides. The first UCK structure provided the structural basis for the specificity, catalysis, and regulation of human uridine-cytidine kinase, which give clues for the design of novel antitumor and antiviral ribonucleoside analogs that inhibit RNA synthesis. Introduction Uridine-cytidine kinase (UCK) (EC 2.7.1.48, also known as uridine kinase) catalyzes the phosphorylation of uridine (Urd) and cytidine (Cyd) to UMP and CMP. In the pyrimidine nucleotide salvage pathway, UMP and CMP are further phosphorylated by UMP-CMP kinase (Van Rompay et al., 1999) and nucleoside diphosphate kinases (Parks and Agarwal, 1973) to UTP and CTP. The first phosphorylation step catalyzed by UCK is thought to be rate limiting (Anderson, 1973). Besides Urd and Cyd, UCK also catalyzes the phosphorylation of several cytotoxic ribonucleoside analogs such as 5-fluorouridine (Greenberg et al., 1977) and cyclopentenyl-cytidine (Kang et al., 1989). In order to exhibit pharmacological activity, such as anticancer activity, these nucleoside analogs should be metabolized to their triphosphate forms, which then act as inhibitors of cell growth via

ute to the structure-based prodrug design of novel antitumor and antiviral ribonucleoside analogs. Results and Discussion Characterization of Ligand-free and InhibitorBound UCK by Ultracentrifugation Analysis In this study, we used the truncated form of human UCK2 (1-250), which we hereafter refer to as UCK, as the C-terminal residues 251­261 were susceptible to proteolysis. In order to study the oligomerization state of free and inhibitor-bound UCK in solution, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation studies (see Supplemental Material at http://www.structure.org/cgi/content/full/ 12/5/751/DC1). The molecular mass determined for free UCK was about 100 kDa, which was in agreement with the formula molecular mass of the UCK tetramer (112 kDa). This result is also consistent with the molecular mass of 120 kDa estimated by gel-filtration chromatography (data not shown). When a feedback inhibitor, CTP, was added to the UCK sample at a molar ratio of up to 625:1, the molecular mass determined for the UCK-CTP mixture was constant at around 100­110 kDa, which is inconsistent with reports that the UCK tetramer dissociates into monomers when bound to CTP (Cheng et al., 1986; Ropp and Traut, 1998). Folding Description All ligand-bound UCK crystals contain two UCK molecules per asymmetric unit, and they are nearly isomorphous except for CMP-ADP-bound UCK. The ligandfree UCK crystal, however, contains four UCK molecules per asymmetric unit. Owing to their poor electron density, the terminal regions (residues 1­18 and 232­250) were not built into any of the five UCK structure models. Moreover, for CTP-, UTP-, and Cyd-bound UCK, no loop region (47­52) was built into the models, again due to the poor electron density. The monomer structure of CMP-ADP-bound UCK is shown in Figure 1A. The core of the UCK structure forms a classical / mononucleotide binding fold, so UCK can be classified as a member of the NMP kinase fold family (Yan and Tsai, 1999). Following the nomenclature proposed for AMP kinase (Muller et al., 1996) and GMP ¨ kinase (Sekulic et al., 2002), we have designated the central region consisting of a five-stranded parallel sheet (1­5) flanked on either side by four helices, A,

C, D, and G, the CORE domain; the region between strand 2 and helix C, the NMPbind domain; and the region between strand 4 and 5, the LID domain (Figure 1). In addition to these three domains, a large hairpin composed of strands 1 and 2 is inserted between helix C and strand 3 in the CORE domain. The NMPbind domain of UCK is loop rich, consisting of one helix, B, flanked by two long loops. The LID domain is a helical domain comprised of helices E, F, and the loop connecting these helices. These properties of the monomer structure are well conserved among the five UCK structures. Structural Similarity Search Comparison of the UCK structure (CMP-ADP-bound form) against the PDB database using the Dali search engine (Holm and Sander, 1996) revealed that UCK has high structural similarity with various kinases in the NMP kinase fold family. Interestingly, two OH kinases, pantothenate kinase (PANK) from Escherichia coli (Yun et al., ° 2000) (with a Z score of 17.8 and a rmsd of 3.0 A for 182 residues) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) from Rhodobacter spheroides (Harrison et al., 1998) (with a Z ° score of 15.9 and a rmsd of 3.2 A for 190 residues), have higher structural homology with UCK than with other nucleic acid kinases. Although E. coli PANK and R. spheroides PRK have almost no sequence homology with human UCK2 (Figure 1C), there are homologs that connect these three kinases with significant sequence homology. Accordingly, these three kinases can be grouped into the same subfamily, herein called the UCK family. The structures of UCK, PANK, PRK, and AMP kinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus, as a prototype of NMP kinases (Berry and Phillips, 1998) (with a Z score of 11.2, which is the highest among the NMP kinases) are shown in Figure 1B. The topology of the CORE and LID domains in UCK is well conserved in the NMP kinase fold family. Although the topology of the NMPbind domain is well conserved among the UCK family, it is different from that of other kinases in the NMP kinase fold family. The NMPbind domain of most NMP and deoxyribonucleoside kinases has a helix-rich structure consisting of tandem helices, as observed in AMPK from B. stearothermophilus, while the large hairpin inserted in the CORE domain is a unique feature observed in the UCK family (Figure 1B). The hairpin of UCK and PANK plays an essential role in substrate (phosphate acceptor) binding. In addition, the UCK family has another unique feature.

Structure 754

The acceptors are recognized by residues on the LID and NMPbind domains in addition to the hairpin, as is observed for UCK and PANK, while those in NMP kinases, deoxyribonucleoside kinases, and other OH kinases such as chloramphenicol phosphotransferase are mainly recognized by residues on the NMPbind and CORE domains, and the LID domain is mainly involved in ATP binding (Yun et al., 2000; Yan and Tsai, 1999; Johansson et al., 2001; Izard and Ellis, 2000). Although the ligandbound structure of PRK has not been reported, mutational analyses suggest that the residues that recognize the acceptor are positioned on the LID and NMPbind domains (Miziorko, 2000). The structure-based sequence alignment of five OH kinases (including two UCK family kinases), two nucleoside kinases, and two NMP kinases against UCK is shown in Figure 1C. The hairpin insertion is conserved only in the UCK family. Although the sequence homology among the ten kinases is very low, there are some conserved residues. Gly-27, Gly-32, and Lys-33 are well conserved in the NMP kinase fold family while Ser-34 is conserved as Ser or Thr only among nucleoside and OH kinases. These four residues comprise the putative nucleotide binding motif, Walker A or P loop motif, which has the consensus sequence GXXXXGKS/T (Walker et al., 1982). Asp-62 is conserved only in nucleoside and OH kinases while Glu-135, Arg-165, and Arg-169 are conserved in the NMP kinase fold family.

G (Figure 2E). An intermolecular antiparallel sheet is formed between the two strands, and both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions are formed between the two helices from each subunit. These interactions (interaction II) are observed between subunits A and D or subunits B and C of the symmetric tetramer, but are not observed between subunits A and D of the distorted tetramer (Figures 2A­2C and 2F). Ligand Molecules Bound to UCK Electron density maps for ligand molecules observed in four UCK crystals are shown in Figure 3. Each ligand is clearly identified per subunit. In addition, one magnesium ion is observed per subunit in the CMP-ADP-bound UCK. The electron density of a nonwater molecule was identified at the ATP binding site of Cyd-bound UCK and was assigned to a citrate molecule from the crystallization condition and the shape of the map. C traces of ligand-free, CTP-, and Cyd-bound UCK superposed on the CMP-ADP-bound UCK at the central sheet of the CORE domain are shown in Figure 4, with bound ligands shown as stick models. Large conformational differences among the four structures are observed in two regions. One region is the acceptor binding site consisting of the NMPbind domain, the LID domain, and the hairpin, where the ligand-free UCK structure is largely different from that of the others. The other region consists of helix G and the loop connecting helix A and strand 2. The loop observed in both ligand-free and CMP-ADP-bound UCK is disordered and not modeled in CTP-, UTP- or Cyd-bound UCK. All nucleoside moieties of Cyd, CTP, UTP, and CMP are bound to the same UCK site in a similar manner (Figure 4). ADP is bound to the ATP binding site conserved in the NMP kinase fold family: - and -phosphate moieties of CTP are bound to the binding sites of the - and -phosphate moieties of ATP, respectively. Conformational Changes in Substrate Binding Sites upon Ligand Binding Conformation of the substrate binding sites of ligandfree UCK is largely different from that of ligand-bound UCKs, while those of four ligand-bound UCKs are markedly similar. Thus, the substrate binding sites of UCK are suggested to mainly take two different conformational states. The molecular surfaces of ligand-free and CMPADP-bound UCK are shown in Figure 5 and are colored according to their B factor values; red indicates high, and green indicates low. CMP and ADP molecules are drawn as stick models. In the ligand-free UCK, one deep curved cavity is formed between the LID domain and the hairpin (the upper-right half) and between the LID and CORE domains (the lower-left half). The upper-right half corresponds to the acceptor binding site, and the lower-left half corresponds to the ATP binding site. The whole cavity is open and easily accessible from the outside. In the CMP-ADP-bound UCK, the upper-right half of the cavity is covered with the LID domain and the hairpin; and the bound CMP molecule, except for its phosphate moiety, is completely buried in the cavity (Figure 5B). In contrast, the lower-left half of the cavity is open, and the bound ADP molecule is easily accessible

Quaternary Structure The tetrameric structure of UCK is shown in Figure 2. The ligand-free UCK crystal contains four UCK subunits per asymmetric unit, and these four subunits form a tetramer with noncrystallographic 222 symmetry (Figure 2A). Although the CMP-ADP-bound UCK crystal contains only two UCK subunits per asymmetric unit, application of the crystallographic symmetry operation results in a tetramer with 222 symmetry (Figure 2B). These two tetrameric structures resemble each other despite their different crystal packing, so it is strongly suggested that they reflect the active tetramer in solution rather than an artifact of crystal packing. On the other hand, CTP-, UTP-, and Cyd-bound UCK take a different oligomerization state. These UCK crystals contain two UCK subunits per asymmetric unit, and application of the crystallographic symmetry operation results in the structure shown in Figure 2C (as these three structures are markedly similar, only CTP-bound UCK is presented). This tetramer contains only one 2-fold axis and is less symmetric. Hence we call the former (Figures 2A and 2B), the symmetric tetramer, and the latter (Figure 2C), the distorted tetramer. The calculated intermolecular buried areas in each structure are summarized in Figure 2F. Intersubunit interactions in the UCK tetramer are mainly localized in two regions. One region consists of four helices (E and F from each of the two UCK subunits), which form a four-helix bundle structure through both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions (Figure 2D). These interactions (interaction I) are observed between subunits A and C or subunits B and D of both the symmetric and distorted tetramer (Figures 2A­2C and 2F). The other region consists of strand 5 and helix

four-helix bundle formation and not in crystal packing for all structures and (2) all four hairpins in the ligandfree UCK tetramer have high B factors in spite of their different crystal packing. A large induced fit at the acceptor binding site is also observed in CTP-, UTP-, and Cyd-bound UCK. However, the conformation of the ATP binding site is almost constant among the five UCK structures. The properties of the induced fit observed in UCK are in contrast to those observed in NMP kinases, where the LID domain of most NMP kinases undergoes large conformational changes upon ATP (or ADP) binding, and moves to the CORE domain to cover ATP (or ADP) as a lid (Vonrhein et al., 1995). Such conformational changes are believed to prevent the bound ATP from being hydrolyzed (Koshland, 1994). As for UCK, bound ADP is exposed, suggesting that the induced fit observed in UCK has a different purpose, which will be discussed later. Structural Basis for Pyrimidine Base Specificity The structure of the acceptor- and ATP binding sites of CMP-ADP-bound UCK is shown in Figure 6A, and a schematic drawing of the hydrogen-bond network between the ligand and protein molecules is shown in Figure 6B. The cytosine base of CMP is buried deeply in the pocket composed of Tyr-65, Phe-83, Tyr-112, Phe114, His-117, and Arg-176, and little space remains around the base. The pocket is too narrow to accommodate larger purine bases. The cytosine base forms four hydrogen bonds with the protein. The N4 atom of cytosine forms hydrogen bonds with the N 1 atom of His117 and the O atom of Tyr-112. The N3 atom of cytosine also forms a hydrogen bond with the N 2 atom of Arg176. These hydrogen bonds are conserved among CMP, CTP, and Cyd molecules bound to UCK. As for the uracil base of UTP, three of the four hydrogen bonds observed for the cytosine base are formed in the same manner. Although the N4 atom of cytosine is replaced by an oxygen atom for uracil, Tyr-112 and His-117 can form hydrogen bonds with Urd as proton donors (Figure 6C). For comparison, the structure of E. coli CMP kinase (CMPK) in complex with CDP (Briozzo et al., 1998) is shown in Figure 6C. CMPK is specific for CMP, and

from the outside. Upon CMP binding, the LID and hairpin move toward each other and their distance is ° shortened by as much as 8 A. On the other hand, the distance between the LID and CORE domains is almost unchanged upon ADP binding. The LID and hairpin have high B factors in ligand-free UCK (average B factor ° is about 70 A2 for both the hairpin [residues 110­124] and the LID [residues 172­177]; colored red in Figure 5), suggesting that these regions are mobile in the ligand-free enzyme. In contrast, they are substantially stabilized in CMP-ADP-bound UCK (average B factor is ° ° about 40 A2 for the former and about 30 A2 for the latter region, colored white and green in Figure 5B). The stabilization is not due to an artifact of different crystal packing effects because (1) the LID domain is involved in the

UMP is a poor substrate. As shown in Figure 6C, CMPK forms five hydrogen bonds with the cytosine base of CDP. If a uracil base replaces the cytosine base, three of the five hydrogen bonds cannot be formed because the residues Asp-132 and Ser-36 can only function as proton acceptors. The structures of these two kinases suggest that specificity for pyrimidine bases is determined by the ability of residues involved in base recognition to function as proton donors and/or acceptors. Structural Basis for Sugar Specificity UCK has high specificity for the 2 -hydroxyl group of pyrimidine ribonucleosides, and phosphorylates Urd and Cyd, but not 2 -deoxyribonucleosides (Van Rompay et al., 2001; Koizumi et al., 2001). In order to examine the mechanism of specificity for the sugar moiety, the active site structures of Cyd-bound UCK, Oxoplasma gondii adenosine kinase (AK) in complex with adenosine (Schumacher et al., 2000) and Drosophila deoxyribo-

nucleoside kinase (dNK) in complex with 2 -deoxycytidine (Johansson et al., 2001) are shown in Figure 7A. AK is specific for adenosine, and weakly phosphorylates 2 -deoxyadenosine (replacement of the 2 -hydroxyl group with hydrogen results in a 600-fold reduction in binding [Iltzsch et al., 1995]). In contrast, dNK prefers 2 -deoxyribonucleosides to ribonucleosides (MunchPetersen et al., 2000). In UCK, the 2 -hydroxyl group of Cyd forms hydrogen bonds with the N 2 atom of Arg-166 and the O 2 atom of Asp-84, whereas the 3 -hydroxyl group forms hydrogen bonds with the N 1 atom of Arg-166 and O 1 atom of Asp-84. In addition, the 5 -hydroxyl group makes hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group of Asp-62 (Figure 7A). In dNK, the 3 -hydroxyl group of 2 -deoxyribonucleoside forms two hydrogen bonds with the protein. The side chain of Ile29 is positioned near the 2 site, which would be a steric hindrance against the 2 -hydroxyl group if a ribonucleoside were bound (Figure 7A) (Johansson et al., 2001).

This consideration provides a possible explanation for the preferred activity of dNK against 2 -deoxyribonucleosides. In AK, both the 2 - and 3 -hydroxyl groups of adenosine form two hydrogen bonds, and the 5 -hydroxyl group forms one hydrogen bond with the protein (Figure 7A). The hydrogen-bonding pattern is quite similar between AK and UCK, although AK belongs to the ribokinase family and has neither amino acid sequence homology nor topological homology with UCK. The two hydrogen bonds formed between the 2 -hydroxyl group and the protein could be responsible for the preference of both kinases for ribonucleosides. However, in order to understand the particular specificity of UCK for the 2 site, further explanation is required. Figure 7B shows the ligand-free (in yellow) and ligandbound (in white) structures of UCK and AK. In both kinases, the position of the residues involved in sugar binding is almost unchanged; however, upon nucleoside binding, the position of the residues involved in base binding is only slightly changed for AK but dramatically changed for UCK. Hence it is suggested, especially for UCK, that the sugar moiety of the nucleoside first binds to the sugar binding site, causing conformational changes in the residues involved in base recognition to form the base binding site, where the base moiety finally binds. During this base recognition process accompanying large induced fit, His-117 in the hairpin and Arg° 176 in the LID domain move as much as 8 A toward each other. In order to cause such considerable conformational changes, the ribose moiety needs to be tightly fixed to the enzyme in advance. A loss of hydrogen bonds at the 2 site should make nucleoside binding difficult and does not cause such conformational changes. Thus, the induced fit observed in UCK endows the enzyme with particular specificity for the sugar and the base moieties of pyrimidine ribonucleosides.

Figure 8. Conformational Changes Caused by CTP Binding Ligand-free (green) and CTP-bound (cyan) UCK are superposed on CMP-ADP-bound UCK (salmon) in the same manner as Figure 4. Ligands and some residues involved in hydrogen bonds are shown in stick models, and possible hydrogen bond pairs are connected with broken lines.

ATP Binding Site The adenine base moiety of ADP is involved in stacking interactions with the side chain of Arg-165. Both Arg165 and its stacking interactions with the adenine base are conserved in the NMP kinase fold family (Figures 1C and 6D). One hydrogen bond is formed between the N6 atom of the adenine base and the carboxyl side chain of Asp-213; however, the ribose moiety of ADP forms no hydrogen bonds and has poor interactions with the protein (Figures 6A and 6B). These weak interactions are consistent with the reports that UCK can utilize not only ATP but also GTP and dNTPs as phosphate donors (Koizumi et al., 2001). In contrast, the phosphate moieties, especially the -phosphate moiety of ADP, form many hydrogen bonds with the main chain amide groups and the side chains of the residues in the P loop. One Mg2 ion is coordinated to the O2P atom of the -phosphate of ADP, the O3P atom of CMP, the side chain of Ser-34, and three water molecules in a tetragonal-bipyramidal manner (Figure 6A and 6B). Figure 6D shows the ATP binding site structures of four OH kinases superposed on CMP-ADP-bound UCK. All residues conserved in the NMP kinase fold family are localized around the ATP binding site. ADP, ATP, and its analogs bind to the P loop in a similar manner in all five kinases.

The binding position of the Mg2 ion in UCK varies slightly from those of four OH kinases, and it is not directly coordinated to Glu-135. This can be attributed to the absence of the ATP -phosphate moiety and to the presence of the CMP phosphate moiety. If ATP is bound to UCK, the Mg2 ion is expected to be coordinated to Glu-135, in addition to Ser-34 and the , -phosphate oxygen atoms of ATP in the same manner as in OH kinases. Feedback Inhibition There has been much discussion over the putative position of the binding site of the feedback inhibitors CTP and UTP. Three sites have been proposed: the allosteric site, which differs from both the phosphate donor and acceptor binding sites (Orengo, 1969; Cheng et al., 1986); the phosphate donor binding site (Deng and Ives, 1975); and both the phosphate donor and acceptor binding sites (Ropp and Traut, 1998). In the CTP- or UTPbound structure, the -phosphate moiety of CTP or UTP is bound to the site that overlaps with the site where the -phosphate moiety of ADP is bound, and the nucleoside moieties are bound to the acceptor binding site. No other sites where these inhibitors could bind have been observed. Hence, they bind at both the phosphate donor and acceptor binding sites as a bisubstrate analog, and inhibit UCK competitively. The feedback inhibition of UCK mentioned here is very similar to that of deoxyribonucleoside kinase, in which its feedback inhibitor, dTTP, binds as a bisubstrate analog (Mikkelsen et al., 2003). Hence, it is suggested that such feedback

dissociates into monomers when a feedback inhibitor, CTP, is bound to UCK, and that ATP stabilizes the tetramer (Cheng et al., 1986; Ropp and Traut, 1998). However, ultracentrifuge analyses reveal that UCK exists as a tetramer in solution whether CTP is bound or not. In accordance with these results, the crystal structures of UCK in various complexed states including the CTP-bound form also showed a tetrameric structure although the tetrameric structures of CTP-, UTP-, and Cyd-bound UCK are distorted. In ligand-free or CMP-ADP-bound UCK, the conformation of the loop region between helix A and strand 2 is stabilized by several hydrogen bonds within the loop where Gln-46 plays an important role by forming two hydrogen bonds with Lys-54 and Gln-55 (Figure 8). Upon CTP binding, Ser-34 at the C terminus of the P loop shifts ° about 1 A away from the ATP binding site compared to the ligand-free or CMP-ADP-bound UCK (Figure 8). This conformational change is caused by the - and -phosphate moieties of CTP through their steric hindrance of this serine residue. Ser-34 forces the relocation of helix A, so that Gln-46 at the C terminus of helix A also moves. In this new conformation, Gln-46 can no longer form hydrogen bonds with Lys-54 and Gln-55, which may cause the loop region to become more flexible, resulting in the loss of its electron density in CTP-bound UCK. Helix G forms extensive hydrophobic interactions with helix A, so that the shift of helix A directly causes the relocation of helix G toward the outside: Compared to ligand-free or CMP-ADP-bound UCK, the N terminus of ° helix G shifts about 1.5 A and its C terminus shifts as ° . These conformational changes observed much as 5 A for CTP-bound UCK are likewise observed in UTP- and Cyd-bound UCK. Since Helix G is involved in interaction II (Figure 2E), the relocation of helix G should trigger the distortion of the symmetric tetramer in CTP-, UTP-, and Cyd-bound UCK. It is not clear that such distortion can be caused when less than four subunits are bound to CTP, and if this were the case, active site conformation of the free subunits might be changed by allosteric effects and their activity might be allosterically inhibited. Further studies are required to clarify the existence of such allosteric inhibition.

that the mutation of Asp-42 (corresponding to Asp-62 in UCK) with alanine exhibited a 105-fold decrease in kcat with less than a 10-fold change in Km values (Charlier et al., 1994). Hence, Asp-62 can be thought of as the invariable general base for most nucleoside and OH kinases. In contrast, NMP kinases, which do not need a general base for catalysis, lack an acidic residue corresponding to Asp-62 (Figure 1C). Upon the nucleophilic attack of the 5 oxygen atom at the -phosphorous atom of ATP, the -phosphate of ATP adopts a pentacoordinate transition state and an anionic charge is produced. The potent candidates for stabilizing the anionic charge are the side chains of Lys33, Arg-169, and Arg-174 because they surround the phosphate moieties of CMP and/or ADP and have direct interactions with them (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6D). The former two residues are well conserved in the NMP kinase fold family (Figure 1C). For kinases lacking Arg169 and Arg-174, the side chain of an arginine residue from a different site is positioned in a site similar to Arg169 or Arg-174 (Figure 6D). In addition to these three residues, a magnesium ion also plays an important role in the stabilization of the transition state by its coordination to the - and -phosphate oxygen atoms of ATP.
Experimental Procedures Analytical Ultracentrifugation The purified UCK sample was prepared as described previously (Suzuki et al., 2003). Sedimentation equilibrium studies were carried out using a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with Rayleigh interference optics. Samples were set in an An-50Ti rotor using double-sector centerpieces with a protein concentration of 0.16 mM, a CTP concentration of 0, 2, 20, and 100 mM, 150 mM NaCl, and 20 mM Tris-HCl buffered at pH 8.0, and ultracentrifugation was performed at three different rotor speeds (8,000, 10,000, and 12,000 rpm). Multiple data sets were analyzed by nonlinear least squares procedures provided in the Beckman Optima XL-A/XL-I data analysis software. Data Collection Crystallization of UCK was performed as described previously (Suzuki et al., 2003). All ligand-bound UCK crystals were obtained by cocrystallization with ligands. The CMP-ADP-bound UCK crystal was obtained by cocrystallization with Cyd and ATP. The electron density suggested that the phosphotransfer reaction between Cyd and ATP proceeded in the crystallization drop to produce CMP and ADP. Platinum and mercury derivatives of CTP-bound UCK, and platinum derivatives of ligand-free UCK were prepared by soaking the crystals in a reservoir solution containing heavy atom reagents at 293 K. The selenomethionine derivative of CTP-bound UCK was expressed in E. coli, B834 (DE3) using an amino acid medium (LeMaster and Richards, 1985) containing selenomethionine instead of methionine. Native and derivative diffraction data of CTP-bound and ligand-free UCK used for MIR and SIR phasing, and native diffraction data of CMP-ADP-bound UCK were collected on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV imaging-plate detector using Cu K radiation from an in-house Rigaku rotating-anode X-ray generator. Native diffraction data of ligand-free, CTP-bound, and UTP-bound UCK used for final refinement were collected on an Oxford PX210 CCD detector at beamline BL44XU at SPring8, and native diffraction data of Cyd-bound UCK were collected on a MarCCD165 detector at beamline BL41XU at SPring8. All crystals were immersed in a reservoir solution supplemented with 10%­25% glycerol for several seconds, flash cooled, and kept in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K during data collection. Diffraction data collected on a R-AXIS IV and on a MarCCD165 detector were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997), and diffraction data collected on an Oxford PX210 CCD detector were processed with a d*TREK pro-

Catalytic Mechanism The UCK-catalyzed phosphoryl transfer reaction between pyrimidine ribonucleoside and ATP proceeds via an in-line mechanism like those of other kinases in the NMP kinase fold family (Yan and Tsai, 1999). Prior to the nucleophilic attack on the -phosphorous atom, the 5 -hydroxyl group of ribonucleoside is likely to be activated by a general base, with Asp-62 the most likely candidate. The carboxyl side chain of Asp-62 is hydrogen bonded to the 5 -hydroxyl group of Cyd in the Cydbound structure. Besides Asp-62, no other residue that can function as a base exists around the 5 -hydroxl group. Asp-62 is conserved among most OH kinases (Figure 1C) and, in the case of deoxyribonucleoside kinases, a glutamate residue is conserved one residue before the site of Asp-62. They are positioned in a similar site that seems to enable them to function as a general base (Figure 6D). Mutational analysis of PRK showed

gram (Pflugrath, 1999). Statistics of X-ray diffraction data used for phasing are summarized in Table 1 and those used for final refinement are summarized in Table 2. Structure Determination The initial phasing was performed by MIR against CTP-bound UCK using the crystals of the three derivatives. Phasing and refinement were performed using the CNS program suite (Brunger et al., 1998). ¨ After scaling was applied to the data sets of the derivatives, the heavy-atom parameters were refined and the MIR phases were cal° culated using the data between 50 and 3.5 A resolution. Phasing statistics are summarized in Table 1. After density modification by solvent flipping (Abrahams and Leslie, 1996), noncrystallographic ° symmetry averaging and phase extension up to 3.3 A resolution was applied to the MIR map, and an initial model was placed on the modified electron density map. Initial refinement was performed by the torsion angle molecular dynamic simulated annealing method and bulk-solvent correction against the maximum-likelihood amplitude target. For each cycle, the model was rebuilt manually using the molecular modeling programs Turbo-Frodo (Cambillau and Roussel, 1997) and O (Jones et al., 1991). Throughout the initial refinement, noncrystallographic symmetry constraints were imposed on all residues. Further refinement was performed using native data collected ° at SPring8 up to 2.6 A resolution. After the resolution was extended ° to 2.6 A, the constraints were lifted and refinement was performed by energy minimization, individual isotropic B factor refinement and bulk-solvent correction against the maximum-likelihood amplitude target. Structure determination of ligand-free, UTP-bound, Cydbound, and CMP-ADP-bound UCK was performed by MR using the CTP-bound UCK structure as a model. As for the ligand-free UCK, MR trials failed at first, so single isomorphous replacement (SIR) phasing was performed using a platinum derivative of the ligandfree UCK (Table 1) and the structure was successfully determined by MR using a phased translation function (Read and Schierbeek, 1988). Refinement of these structures was performed in the same manner as the CTP-bound UCK. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. Acknowledgments We thank Dr. M. Kawamoto and Dr. H.
