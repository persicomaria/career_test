Abstraet--A lysosomal aspartic protease with cathepsin D activity, from the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, was purified and characterized. Its isolation involved ammonium sulfate (30-50%) and acid (pH 2.5) precipitations of protein extracts from whole previtellogenic mosquitoes followed by cation exchange chromatography. Purity of the enzyme was monitored by SDS-PAGE and silver staining of the gels. The native molecular weight of the purified enzyme as determined by polyacrylamidegel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions was 80,000. SDS-PAGE resolved the enzyme into a single polypeptide with Mr = 40,000 suggesting that it exists as a homodimer in its non-denatured state. The pI of the purified enzyme was 5.4 as determined by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme exhibits properties characteristic of cathepsin D. It utilizes hemoglobin as a substrate and its activity is completely inhibited by pepstatin-A and 6M urea but not by 10 mM KCN. Optimal activity of the purified mosquito aspartic protease was obtained at pH 3.0 and 45°C. With hemoglobin as a substrate the enzyme had an apparent Kmof 4.2 #M. Polyclonal antibodies to the purified enzyme were raised in rabbits. The specificity of the antibodies to the enzyme was verified by immunoblot analysis of crude mosquito extracts and the enzyme separated by both non-denaturing and SDS-PAGE. Density gradient centrifugation of organelles followed by enzymatic and immunoblot analyses demonstrated the lysosomal nature of the purified enzyme. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified mosquito lysosomal protease (19 amino acids) has 74% identity with N-terminal amino acid sequence of porcine and human cathepsins D.

INTRODUCTION The lysosomal system plays a significant role in the regulation of important physiological processes in both immature and adult insects. The fat body, which is functionally analogous to the vertebrate liver, undergoes dramatic remodelling associated with metamorphosis and the termination of egg maturation cycles. It is during these periods that the lysosomal activity rises sharply and cellular organelles undergo massive autophagical degradation (Locke, 1980; Raikhel and Lea, 1983; Dean et al., 1985; Raikhel, 1986a, b). In adult mosquitoes, there is a dramatic increase in lysosomal activity in the fat body during cessation of synthesis of the yolk protein precursor, vitellogenin (Raikhel, 1986a). This lysosomal activity is directed towards specific degradation of organelles involved in biosynthesis and secretion of vitellogenin (Raikhel, 1986b). It is important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating this specific lysosomal activity. Cathepsin D, which is one of the most abundant lysosomal proteases (Barrett, 1970), is a good candidate for developing a molecular probe for these studies. Furthermore, the kinetics of the specific activity of this enzyme in the mosquito fat body was demonstrated and the factor triggering the rise in cathepsin D activity was identified (Raikhel, 1986a, c). Although cathep*To whom all correspondence should be addressed.

sins D from various tissues of many vertebrates have been extensively characterized (Kirschke and Barrett, 1987), little is known about characteristics of similar enzymes from insect tissues. The only report on the purification and partial characterization of a cathepsin D-like enzyme was from pupae of the blowfly, Aldrichina grahami (Kawamura et al., 1987). We report here the isolation and characterization of a lysosomal aspartic protease from the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. This lysosomal protease exhibits unique features by being similar in its molecular composition to a vertebrate cathepsin E, but having enzymatic properties ofcathepsin D. Furthermore, its N-terminal amino acid sequence has 74% identity with N-terminal amino acid sequence of porcine and human cathepsins D but only limited similarity with cathepsin E.

WEN-LONG CHO et al. achieved by using a chaotropic buffer (0.12 M Tris-HC1, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.15 M DTT).

Insecls
Headless, previtellogenic mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti), frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped on dry ice, were kindly provided by Dr A. O. Lea (Department of Entomology, University of Georgia, Ga). The frozen mosquitoes were stored at - 70°C until needed. Vitellogenic mosquitoes were obtained from our laboratory reared colony. To initiate vitellogenesis, mosquitoes were fed on rats.

Concanavalin A-sepharose chromatography
Fractions containing cathepsin D activity, collected after cation-exchange chromatography (above) were loaded on a Con A-sepharose column (1.0 x 10 cm) equilibrated with Con A buffer (0.2 M Tris-HC1, pH 7.4, 0.5 M NaCI, 10 mM CaC12, 10mM MgC12 and 0.02% NaN3). The mosquito aspartic protease was eluted with 0.1 M methyl Ct-D-mannopyranoside in Con A buffer.

Purification of the mosquito aspartic protease
All the purification steps were carried out at 4°C. About 20g of frozen mosquitoes were homogenized in 100ml homogenization buffer (0.2M sodium acetate, pH 3.5, 0.15 M NaCI and 0.02% sodium azide). The homogenate was centrifuged at 27,000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and recentrifuged at 60,000 g for 1 h. Proteins in the supernatant thus obtained were precipitated with 3050% ammonium sulfate. The precipitated proteins were dissolved in 10 ml of the above homogenization buffer. The protein solution was dialyzed against 3 x 1 liter of sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M Na phosphate, pH 2.5, 0.15M NaCI). Peptides precipitated during dialysis were removed by centrifugation at 20,000g. The supernatant was concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon YM-10 membrane and the buffer in the protein solution exchanged with 0.05 M Na-citrate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 0.02% NaN3 in the same ultrafiltration cell. About 5-10 ml of the concentrated solution was centrifuged at 20,000 g to remove any aggregated proteins before applying to a S-sepharose fast flow column (1.0 x 10cm) equilibrated with 0.05 M Na-citrate buffer, pH 4.0, 0.02% NAN3. Unbound proteins, which did not contain detectable cathepsin D activity, were washed from the column with the equilibration buffer. About 50% of bound cathepsin D activity was eluted with the equilibration buffer containing 0.1 M NaC1. Fractions with cathepsin D activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon YM-10 membranes and Centricon-30 concentrators (Amicon). SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining showed that at this stage of purification, the concentrated fraction predominantly consisted of a single polypeptide with only a few minor contaminating peptides. Further purification of the enzyme was achieved by its electroelution from polyacrylamide gels after electrophoresis. Although, finally the above scheme was adopted for the purification of a mosquito aspartic protease with cathepsin D activity, gel filtration and affinity chromatographic techniques (below) were also attempted to purify the enzyme. These steps were extremely useful in establishing the identity of the aspartic protease on SDS gels as well as revealing some of its characteristics.

Assay of cathepsin D activity
Whole mosquitoes or their dissected body parts were homogenized in the homogenization buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,600g for 20 min and the supernatant was assayed. The proteolytic activity of cathepsin D-like enzymes was measured in an incubation mixture (200 #1) containing 10 #1 of extract or fraction obtained after column chromatography, 140 #1 of 0.2 M citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 2.9 or 0.6 M Na-acetate buffer, pH 2.4, and 50 #1 of 2% (w/v) aqueous hemoglobin solution as substrate resulting in a final pH 3.0. After 1 h of incubation at 45°C, the reaction was stopped by addition of 40#1 of 180 (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to precipitate peptides. After 5 min on ice the precipitated peptides were centrifuged at 12,000g for 5 min. The digested small peptides released in I00 pl of supernatant were mixed with 700 #1 of 3% TCA and the protein content determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. To determine the activity specific to cathepsin D, 1 ml of 1.5 mM pepstatin A, an inhibitor of cathepsin D activity, was added to the control samples prior to the addition of hemoglobin. One unit of cathepsin D-like enzyme is defined as the amount required to release 1 #g of small peptides from the substrate in 1 h.

Assay for acid phosphatase activity
Acid phosphatase was assayed as described by Raikhel (1986a). The reaction mixture, containing 50#1 sodium citrate buffer (oH 4.8), 50 #1 0,45 p-nitrophenol phosphate, and 20 #1 sample, were incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 60 #1 of 0.5 N NaOH and then the absorbance was measured at 420 mn.

Protein determination
The concentration of soluble peptides was measured by a protein-dye assay (Bradford, 1976) using Bio-Rad reagents and bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
The purity and the apparent molecular weight of the enzyme during its fractionation was monitored by SDSPAGE on 10-15% gradient gels unless specified otherwise under reducing conditions (Laemmli, I970) and the peptides visualized by silver staining according tO the supplier's instructions (Sigma). The native molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated by electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions on 5-15% gradient polyacrylamide gels.

Gel permeation chromatography
The supernatant obtained after acid precipitation of the initial mosquito homogenate was dialyzed against 0.15 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.15M NaC1 0.02% NaN3 and concentrated by ultrafiltration. 4 mg protein was applied onto a Sephadex G-100-120 column (2.5 x 50 cm) equilibrated and eluted with the dialysis buffer.

Pepstatin-aflinity chromatography
Fractions containing cathepsin D activity, collected after gel permeation, were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. During concentration, the buffer was exchanged by washing three times times with 50 ml pepstatin A-agarose binding buffer (0.05 M Na-acetate, pH 3.5, 0.2 M NaCI, 0.02% NAN,) and then applied as such onto a pepstatin A-agarose column (1 x 10cm) equilibrated with binding buffer. Unbound proteins were washed out completely with the same buffer. The bound protein, an aspartic protease with cathepsin D activity, was eluted with a high pH and high salt buffer (0.05 M Tris-HC1, pH 8.5, 0.6 M NaC1). A complete elution of bound proteins from the column was

Isoelectric focusing (IEF)
The isoelectric point (pI) of native form of the aspartic protease was determined by electrophoresis on IEF PhastGel (pH 3-9) using Phast-System (Pharmacia). Standard pI marker proteins were also separated on each gel.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
Tube gels for the first dimension (IEF) were prepared by modification of O'Farrell's (1975) protocol. The gel mix was "made by dissolving 5.5 g urea in 1.0 ml 40% acrylamide/5% bisacrylamide, 2.0ml 10% NP-40, 0.4 ml Ampholyte 5-7, 0.1 ml Ampholyte 3.5-10 and 2.5 ml double distilled water.

Mosquito lysosomal aspartic protease The anode solution was 85% phosphoric acid and the cathode solution was 20 mM NaOH. The gels were pre-run at 200V for 15 min, at 300V for 30rain and then at 400V for 30 min. Protein samples were then loaded and focusing was carried out at 400 V for 16 h followed by 1 h at 800 V. Polypeptides separated in the first dimension were then separated by SDS-PAGE in the second dimension using 10-15% gradient slab gels.

Electroelution of the enzyme from polyacrylamide gels The 40 kDa enzyme band was cut from SDS gels and electroeluted with ISCO Model 1750 Electrophoretic Concentrator. According to the manufacturer's instructions, 40 mM Tris-acetate buffer containing 2 mM EDTA and 4 mM Tris-acetate buffer containing 0.2 mM EDTA (pH 8.6) were used for outer and inner compartments of the concentrator, respectively. The addition of 0.1% lithium dodecyl sulfate to both sample cup and inner cathode compartment buffers improved the efficiency of elution. Production of polyclonal antibodies The enzyme purified by electroelution from polyacrylamide gels was used to produce polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Female New Zealand white rabbits were injected with 40 #g enzyme mixed with Freund's Complete Adjuvant (I : 1 v/v). The rabbits were boosted at 2 weekly intervals with the enzyme preparation mixed with Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant (I:1 v/v). The rabbits were bled 2 weeks after the second booster injection and the sera were collected. The immunoglobulin (IgG) fraction was precipitated from the sera with 35% saturated ammonium sulfate solution. The precipitated IgG was solubilized in and dialyzed against 0.2 M Naphosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% NaN 3, and stored at -20°C in 0.5mg/ml aliquots. The specificity of the antibodies was determined by immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot The proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE or non-denaturing PAGE were transferred to nylon-reinforced nitrocellulose (NitroScreen West, Dupont) according to Burnette (1981). After the transfer, proteins were visualized by Ponceau S stain and the molecular weight standards were marked. The blots were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 0.9% NaC1, pH 7.2) for 1.5 h. Primary antibodies were applied at a 1:500 dilution in blocking solution containing 0.3% Tween-20. The primary antibodies were detected using goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (1:1000 dilution). The antigen-antibody complex was then visualized by a substrate developing cocktail containing 0.005% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolye phosphate, P-toluidine salt, and 0.01% Nitroblue tetrazolium-sodium. Subcellular fractionation The separation of lysosomes was performed according to Alquier et al. (1985). The mosquitoes were homogenized in 10 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4 containing 0.25 M sucrose (TS buffer) using a glass/Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The resulting tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 800g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 26,000g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml TS buffer and then mixed with 10 ml 30% Percoll in TS buffer. The suspension was centrifuged in a fixed-angle rotor (Beckman Type 65) at 60,000g for 45 min. A test tube prepared as for the samples but containing density marker beads (Pharmacia) was also centrifuged simultaneously to obtain a density profile. The gradients were collected into 21 fractions. The fractions corresponding to cathepsin and acid phosphatase activity were pooled. Although, Percoll in the gradient fractions did not affect the enzyme activity assays, it was removed by filtration through glass microfibre filters (GF/D, Whatman) before samples were used for SDS-PAGE.

N-terminal amino acid sequencing After S-sepharose chromatography, the partially purified enzyme (50pM) was resolved by 10-15% gradient SDSPAGE and then electroblotted onto PVDF membrane (Matsudaira, 1987). The membrane was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 in 50% methanol for 5 min, and then destained in 50% methanol/10% acetic acid for I0 min at room temperature. After rinsing with deionized H20 for 5-10 min, the membrane was air dried and the area with the enzyme band was cut out with a clean razor. The band on the cut membrane was sequenced on an Applied Biosystem model 477A protein sequencer directly and resulting PTHamino acids were analyzed on an on-line 120A analyzer (Macromolecular Facilities, Department of Biochemistry, Michigan State University, Mich.). The computer-aided comparison of the mosquito aspartic protease sequence with known cathepsin D and cathepsin E sequences from other species was done using a GCG program from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group and FASTP program (PIR, NBRF, Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.). Two libraries were used for this comparison: GenEMBL protein library containing 28,968 sequences and Amino Acid Bank Protein library containing 5415 sequences.
RESULTS

Purification o f the mosquito aspartic protease with cathepsin D activity In our initial attempts to purify mosquito cathepsin D, we utilized a m m o n i u m sulfate precipitation of proteins from crude extracts of headless previtellogenic adult mosquitoes followed by gel permeation chromatography. Fractions from gel permeation column containing cathepsin activity were pooled together and applied on pepstatin A-agarose affinity column. The protein eluted from the affinity column by the high-salt elution buffer, when analyzed by SDSPAGE, revealed a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 40,000 (Fig. 2, lane 6). The identity of the 40 kDa peptide as cathepsin was additionally verified by inhibition of its activity with pepstatin A in the enzymatic assay. However, the yield by the affinity chromatographic step was extremely low. Even after pH of the elution buffer was elevated to 9.0, < 10% of cathepsin activity eluted from the column and the enzyme rapidly lost its activity. When the bound protein was denatured and completely eluted from the column by the chaotropic buffer, the 40 kDa peptide was revealed by SDS-PAGE. Therefore, due to low yields and increased instability of the enzyme, this procedure was not used. Similarly, pepstatin A-affinity chromatography could not be used for purification of a cathepsin D-like enzyme from another insect, blowfly, Aldricina grahami (Kawamura et al., 1987). In contrast, this method was effectively used to purify m a m m a l i a n cathepsins (Afting and Becker, 1981; Takahashi and Tang, 1981). Finally, cation-exchange chromatography was used for routine purification of the mosquito enzyme after two precipitation steps of the crude extracts. Results obtained after such a purification are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2. Precipitation of the crude extract with 30-50% a m m o n i u m sulfate followed by lowering the pH of the resuspended proteins to 2.5 resulted in a 23-fold increase in the purity of the enzyme. A further 4000-fold purification of the enzyme with a 7% yield of the original extract was achieved by

cation-exchange chromatography of the acid precipitated protein extract on a S-sepharose column. A typical elution profile of proteins from the S-sepharose column is shown in Fig. 1. The fractions containing peak cathepsin activity (indicated by a bar in Fig. 1) were highly enriched for the enzyme as judged by electrophoresis (Fig. 2).

Isoelectric point of the purified enzyme
Analytical IEF of the enzyme on pH 3-9 Phast IEF gels showed that the native enzyme has a pl of 5.4 (Fig. 5). A similar pI value for the partially purified enzyme was obtained by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis when it was separated in the first dimension (IEF) in the presence of 6 M urea (Fig.4).

Electrophoretic analysis of the purified mosquito enzyme
The purified enzyme was analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under both denaturing and non-denaturing conditions. In either case, the enzyme resolved into a single protein band. By SDS-PAGE the mosquito enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 40,000 (Fig. 2). Its native molecular weight was estimated to be 80,000 (Fig, 3). To confirm that the 80 kDa protein band had cathepsin D activity, it was cut from the gel and the gel piece homogenized in buffer was used for cathepsin D enzymatic assay. The supernatant separated from the homogenized gel showed cathepsin D activity (results not shown). Pooled fractions obtained after cation-exchange chromatography, containing partially purified enzyme, were also analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis in the second dimension under reducing conditions a predominant spot with M, = 40,000 was revealed (Fig. 4).

Evidence for glycosylation of the purified enzyme
Fractions obtained after cation-exchange chromatography (lane 4 in Fig. 2) and enriched for cathepsin D activity were applied on Con A-Sepharose column. The absence of cathepsin activity in the unbound fraction and its presence in fractions eluted with Con-A buffer containing 0.1 M methyl ~-D-mannopyranoside indicated that the enzyme is a glycoprotein with mannose on the glycosyl part.

Enzymatic properties of the purified enzyme
The purified enzyme displayed a pH optimum close to 3.0 when assayed with hemoglobin as a substrate (Fig. 6). At 4°C it maintained its activity between pH 2.5-4.0, but lost its activity and degraded rapidly at pH higher than 7. The optimum temperature for the hydrolysis of hemoglobin by the purified enzyme was 45°C as shown in Fig. 7. The enzyme was inactivated at temperatures above 60°C.

Fig. 6. Effect of pH on the activity of mosquito aspartic protease. The pH dependence of cathepsin D activity was determined by using stock solutions of 0.6 M phosphoric acid, 0.6 M acetic acid, 0.6 M KH2PO4 and 0.6 M Tris-base to prepare buffers with different pH (1.5-9.0). The assay mixture was 140/11 of desired pH buffer, 10#1 (0.5/~g) of purified enzyme and 50/t 1of 2% hemoglobin. Each point is a mean + SEM of 3 assays. The purified mosquito enzyme was further characterized by its activity towards hemoglobin as a substrate. The activity of the purified enzyme (0.5 #g) was assayed with concentrations of hemoglobin increasing from 0 to 77.5/~M (based on the molecular weight of hemoglobin to be 64,500). The Michaelis Constant (K~), determined by the Michaelis-Menten plot as well as Lineweaver-Burk plot, was calculated to be 4.2 #M (Fig. 8). The activity of the mosquito enzyme to hydrolyze hemoglobin was also tested in the presence of various inhibitors. In contrast to pepstatin A (7.5/~M) and urea (6 M) which completely inhibited the enzyme activity, KCN (10 mM) did not have any inhibitory effect.

The antibodies reacted with 80 and 40 kDa bands in both samples separated on non-denaturing and SDS-polyacrylamide gels, respectively (Fig. 9). The molecular weights of these protein bands correspond to the native and the reduced state of the aspartic protease (Figs 3 and 4).

Tissue and subcellular distribution of the aspartic protease

Female mosquitoes 40 h post blood feeding were used to analyze the distribution of the enzyme in different tissues. Although cathepsin activity was present in all assayed tissues (whole body, head Production and characterization of polyclonal antibodies and thorax, isolated abdomens free of mid-gut and ovaries, gut and ovaries), it was the highest in isolated against the mosquito aspartic protease abdomens, consisting largely of adhering fat body. Polyclonal antibodies against the gel-purified When the same tissue extracts were analyzed on mosquito aspartic protease were produced in rabbits. immunoblots using antibodies against the purified The specificity of the produced antibodies was estab- aspartic protease, the enzyme was detected in all of lished by immunoblot analysis.

Analysis o f N-terminal amino acid sequence The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the electroblotted mosquito enzyme was determined. The 19 Nterminal amino acid residues of the mosquito enzyme were compared with sequences from two computer I protein libraries with GCG and FASTP programs. The results show that the mosquito sequence has the highest functional similarity with porcine and human cathepsin D. Comparison of the aligned amino acid sequences revealed a 74% identity between N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mosquito aspartic protease and porcine and human cathepsins D [Fig. 12(A)], and a 53% identity between N-terminal amino acid sequence of the mosquito enzyme and an internal sequence of human cathepsin E (Fig. 12(B)].

Analysis of such Percoll gradients showed a considerable reduction of the high density acid phosphatase/cathepsin D activity peak and an increase in the lower density enzymatic peak (Fig. 10). Based on these experiments, we conclude that the higher density enzyme activity peak identified by its content of acid hydrolases and its sensitivity to sonication represents lysosomes. Next, the fractions from Percoll gradient were subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies
(A) Mosquito Porcine Human Asp Protease: D:

In this report, we present data on the purification and characterization of an aspartic lysosomal protease from the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. In general, its enzymatic characteristics are similar to those reported for cathepsins D from mammalian tissues (Takahashi and Tang, 1981; Kirschke and Barrett, 1987) and a cathepsin D-like enzyme from the blowfly, A. grahami (Kawamura et al,, 1987). The mosquito enzyme hydrolyzed hemoglobin as a substrate with pH and temperature optima of 3.0 and 45°C, respectively. Yamamoto et al. (1978) established differences between the activities of rat spleen cathepsin D and E based on inhibition produced by pepstastin A, urea or KCN. We found that in the case of the mosquito enzyme, complete inhibition with pepstatin-A and urea and not with KCN indicated that our purified enzyme was cathepsin D. Furthermore, and more importantly, a comparison of 19 residues of the N-terminal sequence of mosquito aspartic protease revealed a high degree of sequence and functional similarity with porcine and human cathepsins D. Similar comparison with the recently published amino acid sequences of cathepsins E (Azuma et al., 1989; Yonezawa et aL, 1990) showed lesser degree of similarity. To our knowledge this is the first time that the N-terminal sequence of an insect aspartic protease has been obtained.

Mosquito lysosomal aspartic protease The mosquito aspartic protease had an apparent molecular weight of about 80,000 as determined by PAGE under non-reducing conditions and consisted of two subunits identical in molecular weight (M, = 40,000). For the blowfly cathepsin D-like enzyme, an apparent molecular weight of 41,000 was estimated by S D S - P A G E , but the native molecular weight was not determined (Kawamura et al., 1987). Of the two mammalian aspartic proteases termed cathepsin D and E, the former has a molecular weight of about 40,000-50,000 and exists as a monomer in its native state (Barrett, 1977). Whereas, cathepsin E has a molecular weight of about 86,000-100,000 in its native form and consists of two identical subunits (Yonezawa et al., 1987; Muto et al., 1987). The homogeneity of the purified mosquito aspartic protease after cation-chromatographic step was confirmed by isoelectric-focusing and electrophoresis under both denaturing and non-denaturing conditions. The existence of isoenzymes for the blowfly (Kawamura et al., 1987) and mammalian (Barrett, 1970; Smith and Turk, 1974; Whitaker and Seyer, 1979; Yamamoto et al., 1979) cathepsin D was demonstrated based on pI differences between isoenzymes. However, the mosquito aspartic protease in our purified preparations displayed a single pI of 5.4, indicating the absence of isoenzymes. This conclusion was also supported by kinetic data analysis (Bell and Bell, 1988). The purified mosquito aspartic protease from the mosquito was shown to be a lysosomal enzyme. It has ubiquitous distribution in mosquito tissues. The enzyme was the most abundant in the fat body which is characterized by a high lysosomal activity (Raikhel, 1986a). Subcellular fractionation using Percoll gradients demonstrated the lysosomal nature of this enzyme. It was co-localized with the activity peak of lysosomal acid hydrolases, acid phosphatase and cathepsin D. The aspartic protease that we have purified from the mosquito is, therefore, characterized by unique features. Being a dimer, consisting of two identical subunits, this enzyme is similar to a mammalian cathepsin E which is an intracellular but not a iysosomal enzyme associated with lymphoid tissues (Yonezawa et al., 1988). The mosquito enzyme is, however, a lysosomal enzyme and has enzyme characteristics similar to those of a lysosomal cathepsin D. Furthermore, the N-terminal of the mosquito protease has a much higher degree of similarity with cathepsin D than cathepsin E.
