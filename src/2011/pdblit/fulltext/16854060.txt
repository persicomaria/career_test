Based on the X-ray cocrystal structure of the Tang-Ghosh heptapeptide inhibitor 1 (OM00-3), a series of macroheterocyclic analogues were designed and synthesized. Analogues containing dithia, dioxa, oxathia, and carbathia macrocycles were synthesized by methods relying on ring-closing olefin metathesis for the dioxa analogues and by alkylation of thiolates or bisthiolates for the others. Molecular modeling suggested that the incorporation of piperidine units appended to the macrocycles improved interactions through additional H-bonds and introduced further rigidity. These were synthesized in enantiomerically pure form using enzymecatalyzed desymmetrization and diastereomer separation. Inhibitory activity on -site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE) was observed with several macroheterocyclic inhibitors and structureactivity relationship (SAR) correlations were deduced. Cocrystal structures of two synthetic analogues revealed interesting and unexpected binding interactions.
Introduction There is substantial evidence that -amyloid plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease. The generation of this short peptide is initiated by cleavage of a larger precursor protein by the aspartic protease BACE ( -site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme, -secretase). BACE is therefore recognized as one of the most promising targets for a disease-modifying treatment of Alzheimer's Disease and many research efforts are aiming at the identification of suitable inhibitors as drug candidates.1 Although in drug discovery the ultimate goal usually is to identify non-peptidic inhibitors, very often the first step in the process toward such a compound is through substrate analogues. It is well established that protease substrates have to adopt an extended -strand conformation to be recognized and cleaved by the enzyme.2 Accordingly, such protease inhibitors are designed to mimic essential features of peptides in -strand conformations. Macrocyclization is an established method to pre-organize and stabilize this bioactive conformation.3 It has been applied successfully for a number of proteases, in particular aspartic proteases. In many cases, the activity, cell permeability, oral availability, or proteolytic stability could be improved considerably compared with the open chain analogues.4 Only a limited number of macrocyclic inhibitors of BACE have been reported in the literature so far. A first paper reports on cycloamide-urethane-derived compounds linking the P2 and P4 moieties of a hydroxyethylene peptidomimetic inhibitor.5 The compounds were synthesized by ring-closing olefin metathesis, and in the best case, a gain in activity of approximately an order of magnitude was achieved by going from the open precursor to the ring-closed inhibitor. In addition, increased cellular activity was observed when compared with similar open-chain analogues. In a more recent publication, macrocyclic inhibitors linking P1 with either P3 or the nitrogen of the amide bond

between P2 and P3 are presented.6 In contrast to the first examples with linkers between functional groups in the hydrophilic S2 and S4 pockets, in this latter case, the linker consists of a pure carbon chain located in the hydrophobic S1 and S3 environment. Again, compared with similar open-chain analogues a slight improvement in activity was observed. In addition, cellular activity was achieved with the compounds linking the nitrogen of the amide bond between P2 and P3. This is most likely due to better permeability gained by the elimination of a H-bond donor. In this paper, we report on the design and synthesis of 15- to 17-membered macrocyclic hydroxyethylene inhibitors where P1 and P3 are connected through thioether or ether linkages, as well as on novel bicyclic macrocycles encompassing a piperidine ring. Statin-derived bis-thioether macrocycles have been studied already as inhibitors of pepsin and penicillopepsin.7 Modeling and overlays with the published X-ray structure of 1 (OM00-3) suggested that this principle should also be applicable for inhibitors of BACE (Figure 1). Furthermore, novel bicyclic macrocycles containing a basic piperidine ring have been designed to pick up additional interactions with the enzyme. Results and Discussion Chemistry. For the synthesis of the dioxa O/O macrocycles, we relied on the now venerable Grubbs olefin metathesis reaction8 of appropriately spaced bis-O-allyl intermediates as shown in a disconnective analysis in Figure 2. We had also hoped that the mixed oxathia macrocycles could be prepared by such a carbocyclization. However, after initial exploratory studies, it became evident that the synthesis of the dithia variants would require a different methodology due to the incompatibility of the Grubbs reagent with the presence of two thioether-type groups. The bis-O-allyl and bis-O,S-allyl ether intermediates would be generated from appropriate hydroxymethyl amino acids such as serine or cysteine for the P2 site, and a new -hydroxymethyl--amino acid. The latter would originate from the versatile Garner's aldehyde.9 Addition of the organozinc acetylide, prepared from methyl propiolate to 1 at -78 °C afforded the desired 2 (57%) and its

4-epimer 3 (5%) (Scheme 1). Although zinc acetylides have been added to Garner's aldehyde and the corresponding Lcysteine variant, the analogous reaction with methyl propiolate with a favorable stereochemical ratio is, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented. After a number of conditions involving bases and additives were explored, the best ratio of 12:1 in favor of 2 was obtained with n-BuLi/ZnBr2 (or ZnCl2) in ether. Catalytic reduction of 2 led to the saturated ester 4. The minor isomer 3 could be oxidized to the acetylenic ketone, the triple bond could be reduced to 5, and the resulting compound could be subsequently treated with sodium borohydride in methanol to give 4. Treatment of 4 with AcOH in toluene at reflux temperature afforded the lactone 6, which was alkylated via the lithium enolate to give 7 in 70% yield as a single isomer. Cleavage of the acetal to 8 and O-allylation using allyltrichloroacetimidate and triflic acid10,11 gave the lactone 9 in excellent overall yield. Treatment of 9 with butylamine effected ring opening to give the butylamide 10. Cleavage of the N-Boc group and coupling with Boc-AlaOH in the presence of PyBOP gave the dipeptide 11 in 85% yield. Further extension with Boc-Ser(allyl)-OH led to the bisO-allyl precursor 12 in 67% yield. Attempted carbocyclization with the Grubbs first generation catalyst12 did not lead to any

desired product. However, using the second generation catalyst13,14 (20 mol % in CH2Cl2) gave the dioxa-O/O macrocycle 15 as an inseparable mixture of cis and trans isomers in 34% yield. Catalytic reduction led to the saturated macrocycle 16 in 91% yield. The oxathia macrocycle was synthesized via the same protocol (Scheme 1). Thus, coupling of the amine from 11 with Boc-Cys(allyl)-OH proceeded smoothly to give the bis-O,S-allyl dipeptide 13 in 75% yield. Carbocyclization via ring closure

metathesis of 13 using the second generation Grubbs catalyst (30 mol % in CH2Cl2)13,14 afforded the desired oxathia macrocycle 17 as a mixture of cis and trans isomers in 25% yield. To explore the influence of the N-terminal group, we also prepared the N-acetyl macrocycle 18 from acyclic precursor 14. Attempts to improve the yields of these carbocyclizations by variation of catalyst load or concentration were not successful. We next turned our attention to the dithia macrocycles. Since the Grubbs macrocylization of bis-S-allyl precursors corresponding to 13 was not possible, presumably due to the strong coordination with the catalyst, we adopted a macrocyclization protocol based on an intramolecular bis-thioetherification with appropriate dibromides and a bis-thiolate.7,15-17 By varying the length of the dibromoalkenes and alkanes, we envisaged the preparation of dithia macrocycles having 15-17-membered pseudopeptide rings. Rather than utilize the L-cysteine equivalent of the Garner aldehyde18 and to reinvestigate stereocontrolled routes to the corresponding acetylenic ester similar to 2, we chose to use the advanced intermediate from the previous route (Scheme 1) and to introduce a benzylthio group via a Mitsunobu reaction (Scheme 2).19 Thus, treatment of 8 with benzyl mercaptan, in the presence of trimethylphosphine and ADDP (azodicarbonyldipiperidine),20 led to the corresponding benzylthio analogue 19 in 66% yield. Ring opening to the acyclic butylamide 20, followed by peptide coupling with Boc-Cys(Bn)-OH gave the bis-benzylthio dipeptide 22 in 57% yield. Reductive cleavage with Na/NH3 (liquid),21 and treatment of

the resulting bis-thiolate with a variety of dibromides gave the corresponding dithia macrocycles 23-28 in modest to good yields depending on the nature of the products. Four analogues were also deprotected to the amines, which were converted to the corresponding N-acetyl variants 29-32 by acetylation with acetic anhydride. To probe the interactions of the P3-P4 amide, we deemed it necessary to synthesize dithia macrocycles with cis- and transalkene bridges but lacking the terminal N-Boc or N-Ac group (Scheme 3). The common intermediate 19 was cleaved to the amine then coupled with Boc-Ala-OH as usual. Further extension with 3-S-benzylpropionic acid gave the bis-S-benzyl dipeptide 33. Reductive cleavage of the benzyl groups and bisalkylation with cis-1,4-dibromobutene and trans-1,4-dibromobutene gave the corresponding dithia macrocycles 34 and 35 in 51% and 45% yields, respectively. Previous SAR data5,22-26 and preliminary results from our laboratory27-29 had shown a beneficial effect of a valine residue at P2 in inhibition experiments on BACE. We decided to synthesize an extended variant of 27 and 28, incorporating a valine residue and capping with a butylamide (Scheme 4). Thus, 19 was treated with aq LiOH, and the resulting Li+ carboxylate was carefully acidified to give the free carboxylic acid 36 in 91% overall yield. Coupling with H-Val-n-butyl in the presence of PyBOP gave the peptide 37 in 86% yield. Cleavage of the t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) group afforded the corresponding hydroxyl compound 38. A more expedient route was to treat the lactone 19 directly with H-Val-n-butyl in the presence of 2-hydroxypyridine and refluxing toluene30,31 to afford 38 in 66% yield. Extension to 39 and coupling with Boc-Cys(Bn)-OH gave 40 in excellent overall yield. Reductive cleavage and bisalkylation as described above gave the cis- and trans-dithia macrocycles 41 and 42 in 24% and 22% yields, respectively. Various attempts to increase the yields of bis-alkylations in this and related cases were unsuccessful. The series of oxathia macrocycles and dithia macrocycles described above was tested for inhibition of BACE under standard conditions.32 Although little or only marginal inhibition was observed for the majority of the analogues, we found that the trans-dithia macrocycle 42 exhibited an IC50 of 156 nM against BACE. However, the isomeric cis macrocycle 41 showed 10-fold weaker activity. The X-ray structure of 42 in a complex with human BACE was solved at a resolution of 2.10 Å (see Discussion).

In addition to the above-described inhibitors, modeling studies also suggested bicyclic piperidine macrocycles as potential inhibitors so as to benefit from specific interactions with individual amino acid residues in the P3 pocket, such as Gly11 and Thr232 (see Discussion). We synthesized 2,3-disubstituted and 3,4-disubstituted piperidine dithia macrocycles 52, 54, 63, and 69 ,respectively, in diastereomerically pure form (Schemes 5 and 6). The synthesis of these bicyclic macrocycles presented significant challenges. Modeling studies suggested the need for a (2R,3R) absolute configuration for the piperidine moiety as in 54. Our synthetic route allowed us to prepare both diastereomeric final products with either (2S,3S) or (2R,3R) configuration as in 52 and 54, respectively. Results later showed that unexpectedly the (2S,3S)-diastereomer 52 had higher activity compared with 54 (see Discussion). Racemic N-Boc-3-methoxy piperidine 43 was treated with sec-BuLi in the presence of tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) to generate the corresponding R-lithiated heterocycle33 (Scheme 5). Quenching with CO2 and workup led to the R, unsaturated acid 44 in excellent yield. Esterification to the trimethylsilylethyl ester 45 and treatment with benzyl mercaptan in methanolic sodium methoxide34,35 gave a 78% yield of a 1:1 mixture of diastereomeric N-Boc-3-S-benzyl pipecolic acid esters 46. Cleavage of the Boc group allowed the separation of the racemic cis and trans isomers. The cis isomer of 47 was transformed again to the N-Boc ester 48, and the (trimethylsilyl)ethyl (TMSE) ester was cleaved leading to free acid 49. Peptide coupling with the amine derived from 21 gave amides 50 as a 1:1 inseparable mixture of diastereomers. Treatment with Na/

NH3(liquid) generated the corresponding sodium thiolates, which upon alkylation with trans-1,4-dibromobutene gave the desired bicyclic dithia macrocycles 51 and 53 in 54% yield after separation by column chromatography. Cleavage of the N-Boc group gave the corresponding piperidine dithia macrocycles 52 and 54, respectively. The stereochemical identity of 52 was deduced from the X-ray structure of a cocrystal complex with BACE (see below). While the (2R,3R)-isomer 54 showed only weak inhibitory activity against BACE (45% inhibition at 10 µM), the (2S,3S)-isomer 52 showed an IC50 of 190 nM, which was in contradiction to the modeling study (see Discussion). The isomeric (3R,4S)-bicyclic piperidine dithia macrocycle corresponding to 63 (and its 3S,4R-diastereomer 69) were synthesized starting with N-Boc-4-ketopiperidine 55 (Scheme 6). Treatment with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and trapping the enolate with Comins's reagent36,37 gave the enol triflate 56, which was transformed to the corresponding methyl ester 57 using a Pd-catalyzed carbonylation reaction.38 Conjugate addition of benzyl mercaptan in methanolic sodium methoxide gave a racemic mixture of cis-3-benzylthioethers 58. Treatment of the mixture with pig liver esterase in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) afforded the ester 59 and acid 60 in quantitative yield. The identity of the ester 59 was ascertained from a single-crystal X-ray structure.32 Coupling of the amine derived from 21 with 60 afforded the (3R,4S)-piperidine linear peptide 61 in 68% yield. Reductive cleavage of the benzyl groups and bis-alkylation with trans-1,4-dibromobutene gave the intended macrocycle 62 in 39% isolated yield. Cleavage of the N-Boc group gave the corresponding piperidine dithia macrocycle 63 in quantitative yield. A similar protocol was followed for the synthesis of the diastereoisomeric (3S,4R)-piperidine dithia macrocycles 68 and

69 starting from 64, which was prepared from 3-keto-4carbomethoxy N-benzylpiperidine.39,40 In this case, it was more practical to separate the diastereomeric macrocycles 61 and 67, rather than to use enantiopure 59. Our modeling studies also suggested that the carba/thia analogues 82 and 84 of the two 2,3-disubstituted piperidine bicyclic macrocycles would be potential inhibitors of the enzyme (Scheme 7). We therefore in parallel also developed methods for the stereocontrolled synthesis of macrocycles in this new series. For practical reasons, we utilized sequences that would give both diastereomers to maximize information with regard to stereochemical differences. The commercially available 2,3-pyridinedicarboxylic anhydride was subjected to methanolysis, and the resulting acid 70 was converted through well-precedented steps to the extended R, -unsaturated ester 72, then aldehyde 74, which was extended to the allylic alcohol 77 (Scheme 7). Coupling of the corresponding carboxylic acid 78 with the amine derived from 21 afforded a separable mixture of dipeptides 79 and 80. Cleavage of the S-benzyl group, followed by intramolecular Mitsunobu

thioetherification, gave the bicyclic piperidine carba/thia macrocycles 81 and 83, respectively. Cleavage of the N-Boc group by acidic treatment gave the free piperidine bicyclic macrocycles 82 and 84, respectively. An enantio-enriched version was also achieved to assign absolute stereochemistry to the separated diastereomers 82 and 84 and to eventually secure their synthesis as pure diastereomers. Thus, S-1-phenylethylamine was transformed to the bis-alkylated enantiopure glycine ester 85 following Normant's procedure41,42 (Scheme 8). Base-catalyzed cyclization in the presence of CuCN and allyl bromide gave the chain-extended piperidine 86 in 65% yield. Oxidative cleavage of the terminal olefin with OsO4 in the presence of NaIO4 afforded the aldehyde 87. Reductive cleavage of the R-methylbenzyl group and further protection as N-Boc derivative afforded 88, which corresponds to the enantiopure form of 74. Thus, access to enantiopure 82 could be achieved via an asymmetric synthesis. Finally, the diastereomeric 3,4-disubstituted piperidine carba/ thia variants 99 and 101 were synthesized from the previously

described ester 64 (Scheme 9). A mixed cuprate reagent prepared from 3-tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy propyl bromide43 was added to 64 to give an 8:1 cis/trans mixture of adducts 89. Cleavage of the TBS group led to the corresponding alcohols, which were separable by flash column chromatography. Oxidation of the racemic cis isomer 90 with the Dess-Martin periodinane reagent,44,45 followed by Wittig homologation, gave R, unsaturated ester 92, which was selectively transformed to the

corresponding allylic alcohol 94. Hydrolysis of the ethyl ester and coupling of the resulting acid 95 with the amine derived from 21 gave a 1:1 mixture of the dipeptides 96 and 97, which were easily separated by flash column chromatography. Cleavage of the benzylthioether and intramolecular Mitsunobu thioetherification, as previously described in Scheme 6, gave the isomeric macrocycles 98 and 100, which were individually converted to the bicyclic piperidine carbathio macrocycles 99 and 101, respectively (relative cis stereochemistry). Biological Data and Structure-Activity Relationships. SAR of Dithia Macrocycles. Statin-derived bis-thioether macrocycles have been shown to have similar activity on pepsin compared with their open chain analogues.7 Hydroxyethylenetype open-chain inhibitors 103 and 104, spanning P3 to P2, were available from previous unpublished studies in our laboratory. These showed submicromolar activity on BACE and nanomolar activity on pepsin (Table 1). We prepared a number of closely related N-Ac dithia macrocycles linking P1 and P3 side chains (Table 1, 29-31). A dramatic loss of activity was found (IC50 > 10 µM) against BACE, while a less pronounced loss in activity was observed for pepsin and cathepsin D (Table 1). These two enzymes were chosen for comparison because they are the most similar structurally known aspartic proteases (except for the almost identical BACE2). The 15- and 16-membered N-Boc saturated macrocycles were found to have about equal potency for BACE, while the 17membered ring had clearly lower activity (Table 1, 23 and 24 compared with 25). For pepsin, the ring size does not seem to affect the activity, while for cathepsin D, the larger rings are preferred over the smaller 15-membered ring. Compared with the saturated inhibitor 23, the conformationally restricted trans-olefin 28 in the 15-membered series showed increased activity on BACE, while the corresponding cis-olefin 27 was only slightly weaker. Molecular modeling could not reveal any clear differences between the saturated linker and the two olefinic counterparts. The data suggests that in the transolefin, the flexibility of the chain is restricted in a favorable conformation, leading to better binding and increased activity compared with the saturated analogue. As predicted in the model, the aromatic linker in compounds 26 and 32 is too bulky to fit in the pocket, and the activity is therefore lost. The replacement of the Boc group by an acetyl consistently results in lower activity against BACE, as well as cathepsin D and pepsin (Table 1, 23-26 compared with 29-32) as reported by other groups.46 The S4 pocket is substantially more hydrophobic in cathepsin D (e.g., Leu236, Leu 292, Leu303, and Met307 in cathepsin D correspond to Asn233, Arg307, Lys321, and Ser325 in BACE, respectively), which may explain the larger contribution of the Boc group to binding potency. The small beneficial effect observed with BACE compared with cathepsin D suggests that in this case, the tert-butyl moiety of the Boc group cannot make good hydrophobic contacts due to the more hydrophilic nature of the S4 pocket. This inference is supported by the X-ray analysis of the BACE complex with 42 (see below). While both N-Boc and N-acetyl groups allow for the positive interaction of the NH with Thr232, the loss of this interaction results in considerably lower activity as seen in the corresponding amino analogues compounds 34 and 35 (compared with 27 and 28). SAR of Oxygen-Linked Macrocycles. In a limited program, we also explored the dioxa and mixed oxa/thia analogues of the dithia macrocycles (Table 2). For the interpretation of the results, it has to be considered that these compounds were

obtained as undefined mixtures of cis- and trans-olefins. Nevertheless, we can conclude that the dioxa analogues are weaker on all three enzymes compared with the dithia macrocycle (Table 2, 15 and 16 compared with 23, 27, and 28). In the case of BACE, this seems to be due to unfavorable interactions of the oxygen in this specific position in P3. The properties of this position are determined by the closely located lipophilic Ile110 and the proximity of the carbonyl oxygen of Gly11. The detrimental effect of an oxygen atom at this particular position was also observed in other peptidomimetic macrocyclic series (unpublished results). The mixed analogue 17 showed improved activity on BACE compared with the dithia analogues 27 and 28, indicating a slightly positive effect of the replacement of sulfur by an oxygen in the P1 linker. The effect

on inhibition of cathepsin D and pepsin was marginal. The replacement of the N-Boc group by N-acetyl resulted in the same small effect as seen before (Table 2, 17 compared with 18). Due to the difficulty to control the geometry of the olefins, further studies were continued only in the dithia series (despite the tendency for higher potency of the mixed analogues). Effect of Elongation in P. The compounds described so far do not contain an amino acid residue in P2 but rather a butylamide capping group filling the respective pocket. As already demonstrated in other series,27 the elongation of the P side by a capped P2 amino acid increases the activity. In the present case, the introduction of an additional valine in P2 resulted in an increase of activity by about one order of magnitude (Table 3). This is true for BACE as well as cathepsin D and comparable to the effect found in previous series.27 The effect on pepsin could not be quantified by our assay system, but the high activity (<10 nM) is well in line with the activity reported by Szewczuk et al.7 for an analogous statin-derived trans-butene-linked 15-membered dithia macrocycle (<1 nM). Against BACE, the trans-dithia macrocycle 42 exhibited an IC50 of 156 nM and was submitted for cocrystallization. The structure of the complex was solved to a resolution of 2.10 Å (Figure 3) and supported our original hypothesis, showing a very good match of the experimental structure to the one predicted by the model. In particular, a structural overlay of the 1 (OM00-3) complex (Figure 3) with the macrocyclic compound 42 demonstrated that the peptide backbones of both compounds superimpose remarkably well. All important binding interactions originally observed in the complex with the linear peptidomimetic inhibitor were in fact nicely mimicked by the macrocyclic inhibitor. Critical hydrogen-bonded interactions to the BACE active site, including those to Gly34, Pro70, Thr72, Gln73, Gly230, and Thr232, are also observed with 42, further confirming that the binding of the hydroxyethylene transition state isostere is not altered as a consequence of the incorporation of the macrocyclic motif 42. Furthermore, and in comparison to the 1 complex, only a few structural changes affecting the enzyme active site are observed,

the main difference between the two complexes being a small induced fit of the enzyme flap, which can be rationalized by the presence of smaller substituents at P2 and the leaner substituent at P1 in 42. The butylamide cap binds to the S3 subsite and appears to be a good replacement for the P3 glutamic acid of 1, contributing similar hydrophobic contacts to the enzyme flap as well as to the H-bonded interaction to the Pro70 oxygen. Surprisingly, the N-terminal Boc protecting group was not visible in the electron density maps, suggesting that this part of the molecule remains mobile in the complex or adopts several binding modes. This observation is consistent with the fact that the S4 pocket of BACE is large, very hydrophilic, and highly exposed to solvent. Also, our in vitro inhibition data show that an N-terminal Boc group is only marginally better than the corresponding N-acetyl derivative against BACE but clearly more active than the free amine 102 as reported for other cases.6 The electron density for the trans-butene linker in the macrocycle was weak, leaving the position of the double bond undefined, indicating that conformational disorder is also affecting this region of the molecule, although to a lesser extent. This observation suggests that the trans-dithia bridge could be present in more than one tight fitting conformation in the S1 and S3 subpockets, which are both large enough to accommodate a branched alkyl side chain such as leucine, as in OM00-3 for instance. Indeed, flexible docking calculations indicate that several conformations in the area of the double bond are possible without affecting the overall position of the ligand. Bicyclic Scaffolds. In addition to the above-described macrocycles, we also explored two bicyclic piperidine scaffolds with a positively charged nitrogen represented by 2,3- and 3,4disubstituted 54 and 69, respectively. They were designed in the model to each pick up one of two possible interactions, either with the Thr232 OH (as in 1 and other peptidomimetic inhibitors) or with the Gly11 CO (Figure 4). These interactions were intended to replace and compensate for the interactions of the P3-P4 amide or carbamate group in the former structures. To our disappointment, the designed compound 69 was found to be inactive against BACE, while compound 54 showed weak activity (Table 4). In comparison with compound 35 (lacking the piperidine ring), there was no gain in activity for 69 but a

slight gain for 54, indicating that the interaction with Thr232 is more feasible than the interaction with Gly11. The observed parallel gain in activity for 54 compared with 35 in cathepsin D and pepsin can be attributed to a similar positive interaction of the piperidine nitrogen with the Ser235 residue in the position corresponding to Thr232 in BACE. Since the syntheses for both bicyclic scaffolds started from racemic materials and involved a separation of isomers in a later step, we also had access to diastereomers 52 and 63. As for 69, the diastereomeric compound 63 was inactive against BACE and compared with 35, which does not have a piperidine ring, did not show improvement for cathepsin D and pepsin either. However, compound 52 (the diastereomer of the weak inhibitor 54) showed surprisingly good activity (Table 4). Compared with the elongated macrocycle 42, 52 lacks the P4 and P3 moieties. Nevertheless, the two compounds are equipotent against all enzymes. This was difficult to understand on the basis of the model, and the compound was therefore submitted for cocrys-

defined for most inhibitor atoms, it was again weaker for the trans-butene linker, with an undefined position of the double bond. This observation suggests that the conformational flexibility already observed for the trans-dithia linker of compound 42 is also exhibited by the bicyclic piperidine macrocyclic compound 52. In an attempt to better understand the discrepancy between the model and the results for the bicyclic compounds we tried a functional modification in the macrocycle by replacing one sulfur atom by carbon. Unexpectedly, all the diastereomeric carbathia bicyclic macrocycles (82, 84, 99, and 101), were inactive against BACE, including the carbon analogue 84 of the active inhibitor 52. The activities were found to be lower than the respective dithia analogues for cathepsin D (Table 4). Curiously, only the two carbathia analogues 82 and 84 showed inhibition against pepsin (Table 4). Conclusion The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of linking P1 and P3 residues in acyclic BACE inhibitors, which would result in macrocyclic structures. Beside other advantages, these compounds were expected to show improved activity through pre-organization of the bioactive conformation. However, our expectations for activity on BACE were not fulfilled, especially in comparison with the high activity on pepsin. A cocrystal structure of one of the inhibitors in BACE showed that despite the macrocyclization, the molecule still seems to be relatively flexible, as could be concluded, for example, from the weak electron density for the chain positioned in the S1-S3 pockets. To improve interactions through additional hydrogen bonds and to introduce further rigidity, novel bicyclic macrocycles incorporating a piperidine moiety were designed. Synthetic approaches for all possible diastereoisomers of the piperidine moiety were developed. Surprisingly, the biological results did not match the predictions from the model with respect to the preferred stereochemistry. A cocrystal structure of the most active inhibitor revealed a shift of the molecule that unexpectedly placed the piperidine ring in the S3 pocket, while forcing the P1-P3 chain into an unusual conformation and orientation. Experimental Section
Solvents were distilled under positive pressure of dry argon before use and dried by standard methods: THF and ether from Na/benzophenone; CH2Cl2 and toluene from CaH2. All commercially available reagents were used without further purification. All reactions were performed under argon atmosphere. NMR (1H, 13C) spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX-300 and ARX-400 spectrometers in CDCl3, CD3OD, or D2O with solvent resonance as the internal standard. Low- and high-resolution mass spectra were recorded on VG Micromass, AEIMS 902, or Kratos MS-50 spectrometers using fast atom bombardment (FAB). The purity of the macrocyclic target compounds was determined to be >95% by LC/MS obtained on a Finnigan Surveyor MSQ spectrometer. Purity of the compounds was determined by method A, Alltech Prevail C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm) at 0.5 mL/min flow rate using a gradient of 20-90% acetonitrile-water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), and method B, Alltech Prevail C18 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm) at 0.5 mL/min flow rate using 65% methanol-water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Optical rotations were recorded on a PerkinElmer 241 polarimeter in a 1 dm cell at ambient temperature. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on Merck 60F 254 precoated silica gel plates. Flash column chromatography was performed using 40-60 micron silica gel at increased pressure. All melting points are uncorrected. (4S,1S)-4-(1-Hydroxy-3-methoxycarbonyl-prop-2-ynyl)-2,2dimethyl-oxazolidine-3-carboxylic Acid tert-Butyl Ester (2) and

tallization. The structure could be solved to a resolution of 2.3 Å, and in contrast to the crystal structure of 42 with the enzyme, it revealed some unexpected surprises. A comparison of the BACE complexes with 42 and 52 is presented in Figure 5. The structure of the active site and the conformation of the enzyme flap are similar in the two complexes. However, the binding modes of these two transdithia macrocyclic compounds differ substantially in several respects. As expected, the butylamine group of 52 binds in S2 and acts as a replacement of the valine side chain of 42, while maintaining the key H-bonded interaction to Gly34. Modeling of the originally suggested (2R,3R) isomer 54 predicted an interaction of the piperidine nitrogen with Thr232. The active diastereomer 52 indeed forms such a hydrogen bond of 2.9 Å length. However, the position of the nitrogen is not as seen in most cocrystal structures (e.g., 1) but instead is shifted by 1.5-2 Å toward the S3 pocket (Figure 6). Because of this shift, the piperidine carbon chain fills nicely the hydrophobic S3 pocket. As an additional striking difference, the trans-dithia bridge of 52 follows a completely different path in comparison to that observed in the complex with 42. It seems surprising that such good activity is exhibited by a compound with such an unusual conformation of the macrocyclic chain, in particular because the space usually occupied by P1 and P3, as seen in 1, is not filled (see Figure 6). We speculate that this is due to the positive interaction of the piperidine moiety in the S3 pocket as described above. Interestingly, although the electron density was well
