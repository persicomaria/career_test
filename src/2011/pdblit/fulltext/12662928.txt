The CAMPATH-1 family of antibodies are able systematically to lyse human lymphocytes with human complement by targeting the small cellsurface glycoprotein CD52, commonly called the CAMPATH-1 antigen. These antibodies have been used clinically for several years, providing therapy for patients with a variety of immunologically mediated diseases. We report here the ®rst X-ray crystallographic analyses of a Fab fragment from a rat antibody, the original therapeutic monoclonal CAMPATH-1G and its humanized counterpart CAMPATH-1H, into which the six complementarity-determining regions of the rat antibody have been introÊ Ê duced. These structures have been re®ned at 2.6 A and 3.25 A resolution, respectively. The VL domains of adjacent molecules of CAMPATH-1H form a symmetric dimer within the crystals with an inter-molecular extended b-sheet as seen in light chain dimers of the kappa class. Crystals of CAMPATH-1G have translational pseudo-symmetry. Within the antibody-combining sites, which are dominated by the protrusion of LysH52b and LysH53 from hypervariable loop H2, the charge distribution and overall integrity are highly conserved, but large changes in the position of loop H1 are observed and an altered conformation of loop H2. The major determinants of this are framework residues H71 and H24, whose identity differs in these two antibodies. These structures provide a detailed structural insight into the transplantation of an intact antibodycombining site between a rodent and a human framework, and provide an increased understanding of the speci®city and antigen af®nity of this pair of CAMPATH-1 antibodies for CD52. This study forms the structural basis for future modi®cation and design of more effective antibodies to this important antigen.

Secondly, the unusually short amino acid sequence, GQNDTSQTSSPS, makes it the smallest cell-surface glycoprotein known. Experiments have shown the antigenic epitope of CD52 to comprise parts of both the oligopeptide and the GPI (Xia et al., 1993a; Hale, 1995). The CD52 antigen is abundantly expressed on the surface of human lymphocytes and monocytes, and in most cases of lymphoid malignancy (Hale et al., 1985). It is an exceptionally good target for complement-mediated attack (Bindon et al., 1988), possibly because the antigenic epitope lies so close to the cell membrane (Xia et al., 1993b). The unique ability of CAMPATH-1 antibodies to kill lymphocytes by both complement-mediated lysis and cell-mediated lysis has led to the extensive use of these antibodies for the serotherapy of lymphoma (Dyer et al., 1989) in marrow and organ transplantation (Hale et al., 1988b; Friend et al., 1991) and the treatment of various autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (Isaacs et al., 1992; Sundy et al., 1993; Watts et al., 1993), multiple sclerosis (Moreau et al., 1994) and vasculitis (Mathieson et al., 1990). Because of the signi®cant technical advantages of rat monoclonal antibodies (Clark et al., 1983), especially as large amounts are required for therapy of disease, the ®rst CD52 antibody to be used for effective therapy in vivo was the rat IgG2b antibody CAMPATH-1G. In an effort to combat the elicited anti-globulin response produced by this foreign immunoglobulin and to pro-

vide more extended remission for patients, Riechmann et al. (1988) pioneered an antibody ``humanization'' technique and constructed a reshaped version of CAMPATH-1G, which they called CAMPATH-1H. Rather than making a chimeric antibody, retaining the complete light and heavy chain sequences of the rat IgG2b antibody in the variable domain, the reshaped antibody combined only the six hypervariable loops or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) from the original rat antibody with a human IgG1 framework structure, constructed from the kappa light chain of the human myeloma protein REI (Epp et al., 1975) and the heavy chain of the human immunoglobulin NEW (Saul et al., 1978). By selecting just the CDRs, corresponding to those regions of sequence hypervariability classically de®ned (see Kabat et al., 1992) that correlate closely with the regions of structural hypervariability recognized by Chothia et al. (1989), the intact antibodycombining site was transferred. In order to retain the hydrophobic core formed by residues H27, H32 and H34 in the original rat CAMPATH-1G antibody (and many other known antibody sequences), SerH27 from the Fab NEW sequence was mutated to PheH27 in the humanized antibody (Figure 1). This regained the prior af®nity of antibody for CD52 (Riechmann et al., 1988). A second substitution, SerH30 to ThrH30, was made within the framework, to ensure that the new antibody CAMPATH-1H retained the highly speci®c and tight binding characteristic of rat CAMPATH-1G, whilst also providing native human effector functions. CAMPATH-1H did retain the previous speci®city and was equally effective in complement

87 electron density in the ®nal 2Fo À Fc maps is well de®ned for the CAMH and CAMG models, with the exception of a discontinuity for residues H127135 in the loop between the ®rst two strands of the constant domain of CAMH. This loop is bounded by solvent and the electron density for this region is so weak that no coordinates for residues in this loop have been interpreted. Fo À Fc omit maps for hypervariable loop L3 are shown in Figure 2, with the coordinate representations of these loops superimposed upon the electron density. Similar maps were calculated and used extensively to remodel and correct all hypervariable loops. Fab conformation and molecular packing in the crystals The CAMH and CAMG structures have the immunoglobulin fold found in all published antibodies. Four loops located at the opposite end of the constant domain to the elbow and the V-domain (residue numbers L151-157, L196-204, H171-174 and H183-190 in CAMG) have different lengths in these molecules with insertions of 1, À1, 1, 2 in CAMH compared with CAMG. The elbow angle, between the 2-fold axes relating the V and C domains, is more extended in CAMG than in CAMH but the molecules are more tightly packed in CAMG (approximately 36% versus 58% solvent). The calculated elbow angles are 144 , 154 , 150 , 141 in CAMG compared with 128 in CAMH. The most extensive inter-molecular interaction in either crystal is, however, formed by CAMH, in which neighbouring Fab fragments dimerize using a crystallographic 2-fold axis whereby anti-parallel interaction of the amino-terminal b-strands in the VL domain leads to an extended b-sheet (see Figure 3) and also the formation of salt-bridges H between residues ArgL18 and AspL70 . We are unaware of other examples of such an interaction between the light chains of Fab fragments, though they are commonly found within light chain dimers, as discussed below. Similarly extended inter-molecular b-sheets have been seen for the heavy chain domains: the interaction of VH domains from neighbouring molecules was reported by Alzari et al. (1990) in crystals of an anti-2-phenyloxazolone antibody, whilst Derrick & Wigley (1992) reported a similarly extended bsheet in the Fab/protein G complex, involving the last b-strands in the CH1 domain of the antibody and the protein G molecule. Crystals of lambda-type light chain dimers revealed the formation of an in®nite chain of dimers (Schiffer et al., 1985) with an inter-molecular b-sheet between CL domains of adjacent molecules, as is found in more recent structures of this class, e.g. the Bence-Jones proteins MCG (Xu & Schiffer, 1988) and CLE (Huang et al., 1994) with codes 1dcl and 1lil, respectively in the PDB (Bernstein et al., 1977). The presence of a proline residue at position 205 in kappa-type light chains was identi®ed by

activation, whilst it was more effective in cellmediated lysis of lymphocytes than the original antibody and, in addition, it could be administered for a longer period with clinical bene®t (Hale et al., 1988a,b). These two antibodies, and an IgM antibody (CAMPATH-1 M) against CD52, are all still in clinical use, providing perceived bene®ts for an increasing number of patients with a widening range of disease (Hale & Phillips, 1995). Our principal interests in studying these two antibodies were to characterise the outcome of transferring CDRs between two different antibody frameworks and to determine the detailed structure of the CAMPATH-1 antibody combining site. The future design and engineering of better therapeutic CAMPATH-1 antibodies with decreased immunogenicity, for more effective clinical use, will rely upon the structural characterization and appreciation of the residues involved in recognition of the CD52 antigen. Furthermore, determination of the passive role that the framework is likely to play in creating structural variation within antibody combining sites is important. We have thus determined the crystal structures of both CAMPATH-1G and CAMPATH-1H Fab fragments, which contain the same intact antigen binding site in two distinct frameworks. These results provide a detailed structural basis for evaluating the existing biochemical data and are an important step to guide the design of a modi®ed antibody-combining site.

Results and Discussion
For the molecular replacement solution of the CAMPATH-1H, it was found that the best of the search models used were the V-domain of the IgG1 human immunoglobulin Fab NEW (Saul et al., 1978), and the C-domain of the IgG1 murine antilysozyme Fab D1.3 (Fischmann et al., 1991). This supports the observation by Perisic et al. (1994) of the importance of using the correct heavy chain subclass in these calculations. Kabat sequence numbers are used here throughout, as given in Figure 1. Structure quality The correctness of the re®ned models of CAMH and CAMG is con®rmed by several criteria. Firstly, the improvement of the model throughout the re®nement and rebuilding procedures was monitored using a free R-factor (Brunger, 1992b), calculated using approximately 5% of the observed re¯ection data. This cross-validation test was useful in optimising ideal re®nement parameters and relative weights for X-ray, geometrical and NCS restraints. The stereochemical quality, determined using the criteria de®ned in the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), and ®nal free R-factors of the models, reported in Table 1, are in good agreement with other macromolecular structures determined at comparable resolutions.

Figure 3. The structure of the inter-molecular VL À VL dimer seen in CAMH. A complete Fab is shown with the VL and CL domains in green and the VH and CH domains in yellow. In cyan is shown the VL domain of an adjacent molecule at position (Ày, Àx 1/6 À z), related by aH vertical crystallographic 2-fold axis lying approximately in the plane of the paper. The side-chains ArgL18 and AspL70 , which make a symmetrical pair of salt-bridges, are labelled. There is H also a hydrogen bond between ArgL18 and SerL7 . The antiparallel interaction between the ®rst b-strands of the two VL domains, showing the extent of the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between residues L9 ±L12, viewed from the outside of the dimer towards the interface is shown in detail (RIBBONS; Carson, 1991).

Schiffer et al. (1985) as the reason why the intermolecular anti-parallel b-sheet with hydrogen bonds between residues 203 and 209 and 209H and 203H is seen only in lambda-type light chains and not in those of the kappa-type. The kappa-type light chains are found to crystallise using trigonal or hexagonal symmetry axes with orthogonal dyads, leading to extended helical arrays of molecules (e.g. the light chain dimers REI (Epp et al., 1975) and WAT (Huang et al., 1994) with PDB codes 1rei and 1wtl ). This packing was seen by us in both crystal forms of CAMPATH-1H (which is derived from the REI kappa chain) with the second form, which is not yet analysed in detail, being closely related to that reported here by means of a 3-fold translational pseudo-symmetry. The inter-molecular interaction between the ®rst strands of the VL domains in CAMPATH-1H would be disrupted in the case of CAMPATH-1G by the presence of residue PheL10 in the sequence of the rat antibody. Similarly, another kappa chain dimer LEN (Huang et al., 1996) which does not show this anti-parallel b-sheet extension has AspL9 in place of Ser (PDB code 1lvd ). The natures of the residues involved in the CAMH inter-molecular b-sheet (Figure 3) are consistent with those identi®ed as a consensus sequence amongst amyloidforming peptides by Turnell & Finch (1992) in their study of the binding of Congo red, an identifying

marker for amyloid deposits. Our observation in the CAMPATH-1H crystals of such an anti-parallel b-structure interaction between complete Fab fragments, in addition to that already known between the abnormal dimers of light chains, may yield insight into pathologies arising from antibody aggregates, whether these be amyloidogenic or non-amyloid deposits. In the CAMH structure are two other comparatively minor crystal contacts involving three residues located in the CDRs (see Table 2): SerH113 in the elbow region is a main-chain hydrogen-bond donor to a side-chain in loop H2 and is also a sidechain H-bond donor to the main-chain in loop H1; in the constant domain SerH173 is a main-chain Hbond acceptor from LysH53 in loop H2, which is a key residue protruding in the antibody combining site. In the CAMG structure, the four independent Fab molecules interact with each other and with other symmetry-related molecules in a rather unusual way: each Fab in the asymmetric unit is separated from its neighbour by a translation equal to approximately c/4 and whilst the disposition of C domains is relatively conserved, ¯exing of the polypeptide chains in the region linking the V and C domains allows signi®cant variation in the elbow angle of each molecule and an irregular packing of V domains. The elbow angles of Fab

molecules located at approximately z  0, 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 are 144 , 154 , 150 and 141 , respectively. This packing arrangement is the principal difference between the re®ned CAMG structure and the equivalent crystal structure comprising a single Fab in a smaller pseudo-cell with cH  c/4, and acts to optimize the inter-molecular interaction between the hypervariable loops L1 of each ``stack'' of four Fab molecules within the cell and the adjacent stack related by the crystallographic symmetry transformation 1/2 À x, Ày, z  1/2. The most important electrostatic interactions thus mediated are made between the side-chains of GlnL27 and AsnL28 of one Fab and the equivalent residues of the molecule displaced by c/2 (after transformation by 1/2 À x, Ày, z  1/2). A few hydrogen bonds are made between residues in the light chain of one Fab and the heavy chain of the adjacent Fab displaced by c/4 in the same stack of molecules. The nature of these bonds is variable, however, due to the irregular packing of immunoglobulin domains. Comparison of CAMH and CAMG polypeptide conformations gives the results summarised in Figure 4, which shows the distances between corresponding Ca positions in the V domain after superposition using the Ca coordinates of framework residues. It is clear that the association of VL and VH domains, which is in¯uenced by the contribution of the CDRs to this VL-VH interface, is maintained in these two antibodies. This stability results, to a large extent, from the conservation of

residues TyrL36, ProL44, LeuL46 and LeuL89 together with TyrH91, ProH100a, PheH100b and TrpH103, which pack against each other to form the most hydrophobic part of the VL-VH interface. The r.m.s. deviation of all Ca atoms in domains VL and VH is Ê 0.87 A after superposition of the complete V domains, whilst for each variable domain separÊ ately it is 0.71 A after superposing the VL domains, Ê and 0.99 A for the VH domains alone. The most signi®cant differences between CAMH and CAMG in the variable domain, with the exception of residues located in the N termini and elbow regions are in hypervariable loop H1 and, to a lesser extent, in loop H2, which forms an extended b-hairpin loop CDR2 in both structures CAMH and CAMG. Closer inspection of the structures reveals that these differences are in¯uenced by changes in the two amino acid residues located in the framework adjacent to the grafted CDR sequences. Figure 5(a) illustrates how replacement of two residues in the CAMG sequence ArgH71, which is buried between loops H1 and H2, and GlyH24 by two valine residues, ValH71 and ValH24 in the CAMH sequence, disrupts hydrogen bonds in CAMG made by the guanido group of ArgH71 to the main-chain of residues ArgH52 and PheH29. This disruption, accompanied by the formation of a new hydrophobic patch involving residues ValH24, PheH27, IleH51 and ValH71 in CAMH, induces a major change in conformation in the hypervariable loop H1, and a small change in the packing of loop H2 against the rest of the structure. Although the

The variable domains of CAMH and CAMG were superimposed using the Ca coordinates of framework residues 10-12, 17-24, 34-38, 46-48, 53-55, 62-65, 71-76, 86-90 and 98-104 in the light chain, and 4-9, 17-24, 36-40, 46-50, 56-59, 67-71, 90-94 and 105-110, in the heavy chain.

role of residue H71 as a major determinant of the position and even conformation of hypervariable loop H2 has been reported (Tramontano et al., 1990), its effect on the conformation of loop H1 seen here in collaboration with the altered residue at position H24, was unexpected. Whilst the glycine residue at position H24 is a particular feature of these antibodies, arginine or lysine at position H71 is a common feature in other murine antibodies, although alanine, valine or leucine seem prevalent at this position in human antibodies. The absence of a side-chain at the framework position H24 in CAMG enables loops H1 and H2 to move closer than would be possible with valine at this position, as in CAMH.

The antibody-combining site The antibody-combining site (ACS) located at one end of the Fab fragment is formed by the close association of three hypervariable loops from each of the light and heavy chains. In the re®ned CAMG and CAMH models, the loops L1, L2, L3, H1 and H2 all adopt backbone conformations that are consistent with the predicted canonical forms determined by Chothia et al. (1987). The conformation of hypervariable loop H3, shown by Shirai et al. (1996) to be in¯uenced by the presence of a partially buried ion-pair ArgH94 and AspH101 located at the base of a cleft in the ACS (see Figure 6), has the expected bulged structure

described by Morea et al. (1998). The overall topography of this ACS is stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds, as listed in Table 2, between residues in the CDRs. This maintains the relative arrangement of the hypervariable loops. The 61 residues associated with the CDRs, which were used to relocate the rat ACS to the human framework, form combined solvent-accessible Ê Ê areas of 3070 A2 and 2900 A2 in CAMH and CAMG, encapsulating approximately 16% of the total surface area of each Fab fragment. Not unexpectedly, these accessible surfaces are considerably Ê larger than the surface areas (150-500 A2) actually used in forming complexes between peptide antigens and antibodies. General theories have been proposed concerning the relative importance in binding antigen of indi-

vidual CDRs (Davies et al., 1990) and the dominance of particular amino acids (Kabat et al., 1992; Mian et al., 1991). In the combining site formed by the CAMH and CAMG structures, whilst some residues located in the hypervariable regions are inaccessible from the surface, tending to form internal hydrophobic pockets or surfaces, others are clearly necessary to confer stability within the ACS and so are probably not involved in antigen recognition. Those inter-CDR interactions, which are strictly conserved in both structures, are listed in Table 2. Within loop L3, residue HisL91 has an important stabilizing role with both a hydrogen bond from its backbone NH group to the mainchain at TyrL32 in loop L1 and another hydrogen bond from its side-chain to that of AsnL50 in loop L2.

(b) and (c) Atomic representations (drawn by the program RIBBONS; Carson, 1991) of (b) CAMH and (c) CAMG, corresponding to approximately the same orientation as that in (a).

Two dominating features of the combining site are shown in Figure 6. Firstly, in common with several other anti-peptide antibodies (Satow et al., 1986; Saul et al., 1978; Rini et al., 1992 ), a wide

groove, or cleft, is formed in the centre of the ACS and is bounded by the side-chains of residues TyrH33, TrpH47, PheH50, GluH58 and TyrL32. This feature contrasts with the rather ¯atter surfaces

94 formed in anti-protein antibodies (Colman et al., 1987; Sheriff et al., 1987; Padlan et al., 1989). Residues TyrL32, TyrH33 and TrpH47, which help to form this cleft, allow a modest amount of ¯exibility in the combining site and are generally likely to play important roles in non-speci®c interactions between antibody and antigen as a result of their ability to form hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions and attractive electrostatic interactions. Residues HisL91 and TrpH47 appear to be important both through their in¯uence on the side-chain orientations of TyrL32, GluH58 and PheH50, and in maintaining the packing of CDRs. Abutting this cleft, and in contrast to it, is a large positively charged protrusion formed by residues LysH52b and LysH53. These two residues are almost completely exposed and have a combined solvent-accessiÊ Ê ble area of 280 A2 and 253 A2 in CAMH and CAMG, respectively. Figure 6(b) and (c) illustrate the atomic structures of the CAMH and CAMG antibody-combining sites corresponding to the same orientation as the surface representation shown in Figure 6(a). Although the majority of side-chains adopt similar conformations, there are a few notable differences between CAMH and CAMG: in addition to relatively small rotations about the Ca-Cb side-chain bonds of TyrH33 and PheH50, the side-chains of residues LysL31, AspH52a, LysH52b, GluH58 and ThrH98 have more extensive differences in their side-chain torsion angles. For LysH52b, the change in conformation serves to direct this side-chain towards the main-chain carbonyl group of SerH173 of a neighbouring molecule in the CAMH crystal lattice. Residues ArgL94 and GluH58 adopt very different orientations in the two structures. Figure 5(b) illustrates how these two side-chains seem to move cooperatively to vacate and ®ll a void between loops H2 and L3. These movements appear not to be correlated to the previously described heavychain framework differences at positions H24 and H71, and the consequent conformational change in hypervariable loop H1, but to be dependent upon interaction with surrounding solvent. Residue ArgL94 does coordinate one water molecule, but no other speci®c interaction is made by this particular water molecule. Residues GlnL27 and AsnL28 make important interactions in CAMG crystals but the orientations of these side-chains are not signi®cantly distorted. These interactions are not shared by all four of the Fab fragments in the CAMG asymmetric unit, arising simply from ¯exing of the elbow angles.

Structures of Rat and Humanized Fabs

Concluding remarks
Although structural variants of other humanized antibodies have been reported (Eigenbrot et al., 1993, 1994), to our knowledge, this is the ®rst instance in which the structures of Fab fragments from a humanized antibody in widespread clinical use and its cognate precursor have been reported

and directly compared. This CAMG structure is also the ®rst structure from a rat antibody. One of the factors that can in¯uence the interpretation of any related pair of structures is the formation of different contacts between neighbouring molecules in the crystal lattice. Fortunately, however, only minor interactions are made in our crystals: these involve those CDRs known to be least important for antigen binding of CD52 (Gilliland & Walsh, unpublished results), which has resulted in a pair of structures for which useful comparisons can be made. One interaction that does involve residues GlnL27 and AsnL28, located in loop L1, helps to contribute to an unusual packing of immunoglobulin domains in CAMG. Differences in the calculated elbow angles of CAMH, CAMG, and even between CAMG molecules in the same crystal, are not considered to be of biological importance, but simply a feature of the different crystal environments. The proliferation and variation of charged amino acids across the ACS readily illustrates several important points. Although it is likely that a signi®cant fraction of the af®nity and speci®city of the CAMPATH-1 antibodies will be due to the formation of speci®c hydrogen bonds and/or ion pairs with the CD52 receptor, the ability to bury an enlarged surface area, in combination with van der Waals contacts upon complexation, will also contribute. It is not then surprising that the cleft formed in the ACS is generated primarily by the amphipathic residues TyrH33, TrpH47 and TyrL32, as they would most readily tolerate the change of environment from hydrophilic to hydrophobic that occurs upon antigen binding. Indeed, the CDRs contain a striking number of available aromatic side-chains, mostly tyrosine, which are oriented in such a way that they expose the phenolic hydroxyl groups for possible speci®c interaction with CD52 or anchoring of a side-chain or group in this cleft. On binding the antigen CD52, it has been shown that CAMPATH-1 antibodies also recognize a nonprotein epitope that is particular to the associated GPI anchor. The prominence of LysH52b and LysH53, forming a positively charged, mouldable surface, expected to re¯ect their potential importance in binding antigen, would enable these antibodies to interact with negatively charged constituent phosphate groups of the GPI anchor. This conclusion is supported by the results of studies by Gilliland & Walsh (unpublished) who have illustrated the important role that hypervariable loop H2 plays in antigen recognition. In this respect, the CAMPATH-1 antibodies also display typical preference for contacting the polypeptide antigen by using residues primarily from the heavy chain (Davies et al., 1990; Wilson & Stan®eld, 1993). Residues ValH71 and ValH24 in the sequence of the humanized antibodies (derived from Fab NEW) have been shown to change the conformation of loop H1 and the packing of loop H2 against the rest of the structure. In CAMG these

residues are arginine and glycine, respectively. From this we conclude that the integrity of the antibody-combining site, compared to the cognate structure, could be improved by retention of the CAMG residues at these positions. However, as the af®nity of the humanized antibody is similar to that of the original, it can be assumed from these structures that the conformation of loop H1 is relatively unimportant for antigen recognition. This is consistent with the conclusions reached by Gilliland & Walsh (unpublished results). The relatively small rigid-body shift (approximately Ê 1.5 A) in the position of loop H2, the most important loop for antigen binding, must be accommodated by ¯exibility in formation of the antigen complex. It can also be concluded that the speci®c framework change made by Riechmann et al. (1988) during humanization of CAMPATH-1G, whereby residue SerH27 from the IgG1 framework became PheH27in CAMPATH1H, has indeed helped to maintain the overall packing of CDRs. The second framework residue changed (SerH30 to ThrH30) is nearby within the Vernier zone, identi®ed by Foote & Winter (1992) as controlling the adjustment of the CDR structure and ®ne-tuning this to ®t the antigen. Elucidation of the antibody-antigen interaction was ®rst attempted by diffusion into both CAMG and CAMH crystals of the synthetic heptapeptide identi®ed by Hale (1995) as a mimotope of the CAMPATH-1 antigen. The presence of this peptide within the CAMG crystals caused suf®cient loss of crystalline order that, whilst diffraction data were measured, the high crystal mosaicity prevented details of the binding from being clearly de®ned. Diffusion of this peptide into the CAMH crystals caused them to dissolve rapidly, as a consequence of the proximity of the antigen-binding site to a major intermolecular interaction of this crystal lattice. Further work is in progress to grow suitable crystals of each antibody with bound ligand. In this study we have illustrated how CDR sequences can be grafted onto new antibody frameworks with only minor disruption of the original antibody-combining site, and we have identi®ed several framework positions that are important for the arrangement of the antibodycombining site in these antibodies. We have identi®ed several residues likely to be crucial for CD52 recognition. The uncomplexed Fab structures are unable, however, to account fully for all other factors that might in¯uence antigen binding. Other studies have illustrated that conformational changes, which may involve only small side-chain movements, conformational changes in hypervariable loops or, more signi®cantly, re-arrangements in the VL-VH interface, may occur in the structure of both the antibody and the antigen. A fuller picture of the speci®city and af®nity of these antibodies for CD52 can be expected from the crystallisation and structure determination of the complex formed between these antibodies and

Materials and Methods
Data collection Antibodies were obtained from ascitic ¯uid (CAMPATH-1G) or from hybridoma culture supernatant (CAMPATH-1H) by protein A chromatography. Fab fragments obtained by papain digestion were puri®ed by cation-exchange HPLC. Crystallization conditions were screened using the footprint solubility screen designed by Stura et al. (1992) with the sitting drop technique. Fab fragments of CAMPATH-1H crystallised readily in two different forms, whereas those of CAMPATH-1G only crystallised after more exhaustive searching for conditions. The two crystal forms of Fab molecules reported here, referred to as CAMG and CAMH, respectively, were grown in the conditions shown in Table 1. A combination of the high solvent content and consequent weak diffraction, with the radiation sensitivity and the large unit cell of the CAMH crystals meant that useful data could be recorded only by using a Synchrotron Radiation Source. Consequently, an almost complete set of data was collected using two crystals at station PX9.5 at the Daresbury SRS. For the larger, more robust Ê CAMG crystals, data were collected to beyond 3.0 A using a laboratory X-ray source. However, higher-resolution and more accurate data were later collected at the SRS, under operating conditions similar to those described above for CAMH. All data were integrated using MOSFLM (Leslie, 1992) and reduced to a unique set of structure factors using the CCP4 software suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The data used for all crystallographic calculations described are summarised in Table 1. Structure determination The CAMH structure was determined by molecular replacement using a number of superimposed search models constructed from the framework regions of known Fab structures in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977). All hypervariable regions were omitted from these models for calculations of crossrotation and translation functions, using the program AMORE (Navaza, 1994), which were performed separately for the V and C domains to allow for the known ¯exibility of Fab fragments in the elbow region. Prior to re®nement and remodelling of CAMH, the entire VL domain of the molecular replacement model NEW (PDB code 7fab) was replaced by superposition of the corresponding domain (PDB code 1rei) of the human myeloma protein REI (Epp et al., 1975), as used for the light chain of this humanized antibody CAMPATH-1H, and in the VH domain the two framework region changes already described, SerH27Phe and SerH30Thr, were made to the model. The remaining side-chains were modi®ed to ®t the correct sequence by comparison to the electron density maps. The CAMG structure was determined in a similar manner from partially re®ned coordinates of the CAMH model using a modi®ed molecular replacement strategy implemented in the program XPLOR (Brunger, 1990), treating the four VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains as independent rigid bodies for Patterson correlation (PC)

re®nement. It was quickly recognised that CAMG crystals possessed unusually strong pseudo-symmetry: the relatively intense nature of diffraction spots with indices h, k, l; l  4n in the observed data for CAMG and singularly large peaks at (0, 0, 1/4) and (0, 0, 1/2) in the native Patterson map, suggested four similarly oriented Fab molecules per asymmetric unit, each separated by

Structures of Rat and Humanized Fabs translations equal to c/4, where c is the unit cell dimension parallel to z. Intervening diffraction spots, with indices h, k, l; l T 4n had signi®cant diffraction intensity only Ê at Bragg d-spacings less than about 4.5 A. Both of the CAMH and CAMG models were re®ned using XPLOR (Brunger, 1992a) and CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) and rebuilt into electron density maps (program O,

In this way, the correct Fab sequences, as determined by Crowe et al. (1992) and Riechmann et al. (1988), and the conformations of hypervariable loop regions were remodelled with con®dence. Electron density maps were calculated using model phases that had been modi®ed to remove model bias according to the method developed by Read (1986) and a solvent ¯attening and averaging procedure implemented in the program DM (Cowtan, 1994). Due to the limited resolution of data available for re®nement of the CAMH model, water molecules were not included and only two temperature factor parameters (main-chain atoms and side-chain atoms constrained to be equivalent) were re®ned for each amino acid. For the re®nement of the CAMG model, the best results were achieved by applying relatively large NCS restraint energies of Ê Ê 800 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 and 400 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 for mainchain and side-chain positional parameters, and small Ê Ê target sigma values of 0.3 A2 and 0.6 A2 for main-chain and side-chain temperature factors. The additional Ê Ê observed data between 3.0 A and 2.6 A (which could be measured only at a synchrotron source of X-rays) were particularly important for this re®nement as re¯ections with indices h, k, l; l T 4n are systematically weak at lower resolution. Once it was clear that there were relatively small, but signi®cant, differences in the side-chain conformations of residues located in hypervariable loop L1, NCS restraints were removed for this loop. For the remainder of the molecule, at convergence, each of the four domains, VL (excluding CDR1), VH, CL and CH1 could be superimposed with the corresponding domain from the three other molecules with mean r.m.s. deviÊ ations of less than 0.01 A for Ca atoms. Mean deviations Ê between the four L1 loops were 0.26 A for Ca atoms and Ê 0.75 A for all atoms. Figure 7(a) shows the agreement of observed and calculated structure factors in the resolÊ ution range 10-2.6 A for the two classes of re¯ections (h, k, l; l  4n and h, k, l; l T 4n) and highlights the dif®culty in scaling (Figure 7(b)) and using data at resolutions Ê lower than about 4.5 A for re®nement of this particular structure. The systematic difference between the R-factors for the classes of re¯ections h, k, l; l  4n and h, k, l; l T 4n shown in Figure 7(c) is seen from Figure 7(d) to be a consequence of their relative amplitudes. Further consideration of the consequences of this particular form of pseudo-symmetry will be presented elsewhere. PDB accession codes The coordinates and structure amplitudes have been deposited in the PDB with respective codes 1rbey and r1beysf for CAMG and 1bfos and r1bfosf for CAMH.
