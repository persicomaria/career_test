Overexpression of ErbB2 has been found in approximately 25­30% of human breast cancers and has been shown to render the cancer cells more resistant to chemotherapy. However, it is not clear whether ErbB2 overexpression renders the cells more resistant to specific anti-cancer drugs or renders the cells more resistant to a broad range of anti-cancer drugs. It is not clear how the function of ErbB2 in drug resistance is related to expression and activation of the other ErbB receptors. In this communication, we showed that several breast cancer cell lines including BT20, BT474, MCF-7, MDA-MB-453, and SKBR-3 cells had a similar pattern of resistance to a broad range of anti-cancer drugs including 5-Fluorouracil, Cytoxan, Doxorubincin, Taxol, and Vinorelbin, suggesting a mechanism of multidrug resistance. High expression of P-glycoprotein and the ErbB receptors contribute to drug resistance of these breast cancer cells; however, overexpression of ErbB2 alone is not a major factor in determining drug resistance. To further determine the role of the ErbB receptors in drug resistance, we selected various NIH 3T3 cell lines that specifically expressed EGF receptor (EGFR), ErbB2, ErbB3, EGFR/ErbB2, EGFR/ErbB3, or ErbB2/ErbB3. A cytotoxicity assay showed that expression of ErbB2 alone did not significantly enhance drug resistance, whereas coexpression of either EGFR or ErbB3 with ErbB2 significantly enhanced drug resistance. Moreover, ErbB2 was highly phosphorylated in NIH 3T3 cells that coexpress ErbB2 with either EGFR or ErbB3, but not in NIH 3T3 cells that express ErbB2 alone. Together, our results suggest that coexpression of EGFR or ErbB3 with ErbB2 induces high phosphorylation of ErbB2 and renders the cells more resistant to various anti-cancer drugs. © 2000 Academic Press Key Words: EGF receptors; ErbB2; ErbB3; drug resistance; breast cancer; phosphorylation.

The receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) is the prototype for a subfamily of structurally related proteins [termed class I/ErbB receptors (1)] that mediate the proliferation and differentiation of normal cells (2). The other three members of the ErbB receptor family include Her2/ErbB2/neu (3, 4), Her3/ErbB3 (5), and Her4/ErbB4 (6). It has been suggested that the aberrant activation of their kinase activities contributes to tumorigenesis or progression (7). The ErbB receptors play important roles in the development of breast cancer (8). Following the first report of elevated expression of EGF receptor (EGFR) in primary breast cancers (9), more research has revealed that overexpression of EGFR occurs in about 40% of cases (8). Overexpression of ErbB2 has been found in approximately 25­30% of human breast cancers (10, 11), while overexpression of ErbB3 has been reported in 20% breast cancers (12). In addition, overexpression of ErbB4 has been reported in various breast cancer cell lines (6); however, very little is known in primary breast cancers. Patients whose breast tumors overexpress the ErbB2 gene have a significantly lower survival rate and a shorter time to relapse than patients without the ErbB2 gene overexpression (10). Also, high levels of ErbB2 expression have been positively correlated with lymph node metastasis in breast cancers (13, 14). Some results suggest that high levels of ErbB2 expression positively correlated with the resistance to certain anti-cancer drugs and radiation-therapies (15, 16). However, it is not clear whether ErbB2 overexpression renders cells more resistant to specific drugs by altering the specific cellular process or renders cells more resistant to a broad range of drugs by a mechanism similar to the multidrug resistance protein P-glycoprotein. The ErbB family is unique among other groups of receptor tyrosine kinases in that one receptor, ErbB3, has an impaired kinase activity, while another member of the group, ErbB2, may not have a direct ligand.

BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS trations, the cells were incubated for another 72 h. The percentages of viable cells were then determined by reduction of MTS (3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium, inner salt), relative to drug-free controls, using the CellTiter96 AQ nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega Corp.). All cytotoxicity data were means of at least three independent experiments. IC50 was measured from the dose-response curve. Immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed with immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mM NaF, 0.5 mM Na 3VO 4, 0.02% NaN 3, 0.1 mM AEBSF, 10 g/ml aprotinin, 1 M pepstatin A, pH 7.5) overnight at 4°C. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h to remove unsolubilized debris. The supernatants, containing 1 mg of total proteins, were then incubated with 1 g of mouse antiphosphotyrosine antibody PY99 (Santa Cruz) for 2 h with gentle mixing by inverting. After that, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with agarose was added to each fraction and incubated for 2 h with agitation. Finally, both the agarose beads and the nonprecipitated supernatant were collected by centrifugation. The agarose beads were washed twice with IP buffer. For the control experiments, the mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was substituted with normal mouse IgG (Sigma) and no EGFR, ErbB2, or ErbB3 was precipitated with this normal mouse IgG. Immunoblotting. The total cell lysates were prepared by using M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol in the presence of 0.5 mM Na 3VO 4, 0.02% NaN 3, 0.1 mM AEBSF, 10 g/ml aprotinin, 1 M pepstatin A. For the detection of EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and P-glycoprotein in the total lysates, aliquots containing 10 g of protein from each cell lysate were used. For the detection of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 from the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates, one fifth of the immunoprecipitate was used. The protein samples were separated by electrophoresis through 10% polyacrylamide SDS-containing gels and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose filter paper. Filters were probed with polyclonal rabbit anti-EGFR 1005 (Santa Cruz), anti-ErbB2 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-ErbB3 (Santa Cruz), or anti-P-glycoprotein (Oncogene) antibodies. The primary antibodies were detected with a polyclonal goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence development (Pierce) and quantitated with FluorChem digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corporation).

tivation of all of the ErbB receptors in response to ligand stimulation (2, 17). EGF and Heregulin (also named neuregulin and neu differentiation factor) have been found to induce heterodimeric complexes between any two members of the four ErbB receptors (6, 7, 17­27). It has also been reported that ErbB2 is the preferred heterodimeric partner of ErbB3 and ErbB4 (20, 21). Thus, the function of ErbB2 in drug resistance must be studied in conjunction with the other ErbB receptors. In order to understand the molecular mechanism by which ErbB2 overexpression contributes to drug resistance, we need first to reveal whether ErbB2 overexpression render the cells more resistance to specific drugs or a broad range of drugs. We also need to reveal whether and how the expression of ErbB2 heterodimerization partners contributes to drug resistance. In this communication, we studied the relationship between ErbB receptor expression and drug resistance in several breast cancer cell lines including BT20, BT474, MCF-7, MDA-MB-453, and SKBR-3 cells. We showed that the high expression of ErbB2 alone was not a major factor in determining drug resistance. We further studied the role of ErbB receptors in drug resistance in selected NIH 3T3 cell lines that specifically expressed EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, EGFR/ ErbB2, EGFR/ErbB3, or ErbB2/ErbB3. We found that expression of ErbB2 alone did not significantly enhance drug resistance, whereas coexpression of either EGFR or ErbB3 with ErbB2 significantly enhanced drug resistance. Moreover, ErbB2 was highly phosphorylated in NIH 3T3 cells that coexpressed ErbB2 with either EGFR or ErbB3, but not in NIH 3T3 cells that expressed ErbB2 alone. Together, our results suggest that coexpression of ErbB2 with EGFR or ErbB3 induces high phosphorylation of ErbB2 and renders the cells more resistant to various anti-cancer drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells lines and culture. NIH 3T3, BT20, BT474, MCF-10, MCF-7, MDA-MB453, and SKBR3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were grown at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle (DME) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, penicillin, and streptomycin, and maintained in a 7% CO 2 atmosphere. Selection of NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing EGFR, ErbB2, and/or ErbB3. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with an EGFR expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1( )/EGFR, an ErbB2 expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1( )/ErbB2, or an ErbB3 expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1( )/ ErbB3, or cotransfected with any two of the above three plasmids by calcium phosphate precipitation. Transfected cells were selected in DMEM media containing 600 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cytotoxicity assay. The cytotoxicity assay was performed as previously described (28). Cells were plated onto 96-well plates, 5000 cells/well for each breast cancer cell line. Twenty-four hours later, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing anti-cancer drugs (Bristol-Meyer Squibb Company). For the dose response analysis, after the addition of drugs at indicated concen-

RESULTS Chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells to various drugs. We performed cytotoxicity assays on various breast cancer cell lines, including BT20, BT474, MCF7, MDA-MB453, and SKBR3, and on a normal breast cell line MCF-10 to determine their chemosensitivity to various anti-cancer drugs including 5-Fluorouracil, Cytoxan, Doxorubincin, Taxol, and Vinorelbin. Cells were grown in the presence of different concentrations of the drugs, and the percentage of viable cells relative to the drug-free control was determined by the "CellTiter96TM AQ one solution nonradioactive cell proliferation assay." As shown in Fig. 1, different cell lines had different chemosensitivity to the various anti-cancer drugs and all of the breast cancer cell lines are more resistant than the normal breast cell MCF-10. Moreover, among the five breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and BT20 cells were most resistant, BT474 and SKBR-3 cells were moderately resistant, and MDA453 cells was less resistant to the anti-cancer drugs (Fig. 1 and Table 1).

FIG. 1. Dose-response curve of breast cancer cell lines to various anti-cancer drugs. Cytotoxicity of various anti-cancer drugs at various concentrations in the indicated cell lines was determined as described under Materials and Methods. The means of at least three independent experiments were plotted.

P-glycoprotein expression levels and the relation to drug resistance. The broad resistance to the tested drugs by MCF-7 and BT20 cells suggests a mechanism of multidrug resistance. To test this hypothesis, we examined P-glycoprotein expression levels in these cell lines by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 and Table 1). MCF-10 cells had the lowest P-glycoprotein expression level and SKBR-3, MCF-7, and BT474 cells had the highest P-glycoprotein expression level. The P-glycoprotein expression level in these cells was positively correlated with their drug resistance. However, MDA-453 cells that were very sensitive to drug treatment had a high P-glycoprotein expression level, and BT20 cells that were very resistant to drug treatment had a low

P-glycoprotein expression level. These results suggest that in addition to P-glycoprotein expression levels, some other factors must be important in determining drug resistance of the breast cancer cells. ErbB expression levels and the relation to drug resistance. To determine whether drug resistance is related to the expression levels of the ErbB receptors, we examined the ErbB receptor expression levels by immunoblotting. The ErbB receptor expression levels were very different in these cells (Fig. 3 and Table 1). MCF-10 cells that were most sensitive to drug treatment had no detectable expression of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3. BT20 cells that were very resistant to drug

The relative amounts of P-glycoprotein, EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 were quantified with FluorChem digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corporation). The amounts of P-glycoprotein, EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 were highest in SKBR-3, BT20, BT474, and SKBR-3 cells, respectively, and were set at 100. The amounts of these proteins in other cell lines were calculated relative to it. Data were means standard error of three experiments.

treatment had a very high EGFR expression level and low ErbB2 and ErbB3 expression levels. BT474 and SKBR3 cells that were moderately resistant to the anti-cancer drugs had very high expression levels of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3. MDA-453 cells that were very sensitive to drug treatment had a moderate ErbB3 expression level and low EGFR and ErbB2 expression levels. MCF-7 cells that were very resistant to drug treatment had a moderate ErbB3 expression level and nondetectable EGFR and ErbB2 expression. These results indicate that compared with the normal breast cells (MCF-10), all of these breast cancer cells express at least one of the ErbB receptors at a moderate to high level, which suggest that high levels of the ErbB receptor expression may contribute to drug resistance. Among the ErbB receptors, the high EGFR expression level positively correlates to the high drug resistance in all of the tested cells except for MCF-7 cells. While the correlation between ErbB2 and ErbB3 expression levels and drug resistance is not obvious. Relationship between ErbB receptor expression, activation, and drug resistance in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the ErbB receptors. To eliminate the possibility that the observed correlation between ErbB

receptor expression and drug resistance among the breast cancer cell lines are due to the differences in cellular context, we transfected NIH 3T3 cells with pcDNA3.1 plasmids containing EGFR, ErbB2, or ErbB3. Various cell lines including NIH 3T3-EGFR, NIH 3T3-ErbB2, NIH 3T3-ErbB3, NIH 3T3-EGFR/ ErbB2, NIH 3T3-EGFR/ErbB3, and NIH 3T3-ErbB2/ ErbB3 that specifically expressed EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, EGFR/ErbB2, EGFR/ErbB3, and ErbB2/ ErbB3, respectively, were selected with G418. The EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB3 expression levels were determined by Western blot (Fig. 4 and Table 2). We then performed the cytotoxicity assays on these selected NIH 3T3 cell lines to determine their chemosensitivity to various anti-cancer drugs including 5-Fluorouracil, Cytoxan, Doxorubincin, Taxol, and

Vinorelbin. As shown in Table 2, compared with parent NIH 3T3 cells, NIH 3T3-ErbB2 and NIH 3T3 ErbB3 were slightly resistant; NIH 3T3-EGFR and NIH 3T3EGFR/ErbB3 cells were moderately resistant; but NIH 3T3-EGFR/ErbB2 and NIH 3T3-ErbB2/ErbB3 cells were strongly resistant to these drugs. These results suggest that expression of ErbB2 alone only slightly enhances drug resistance, but coexpression of ErbB2 with EGFR or ErbB3 significantly enhances drug resistance of these cells.

ErbB phosphorylation levels and the relation to drug resistance. All of the cytotoxicity assay were performed in the presence of 10% FBS. Growth factors contained in the FBS may activate the ErbB receptors. Since the activation level of the ErbB receptors is more important than the expression level, we examined the phosphorylation of the ErbB receptors and the relation to drug resistance. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and then blotted with antibodies to EGFR, ErbB2, or ErbB3 (Fig. 5). Our results demonstrated that ErbB2 was slightly phosphorylated in NIH 3T3-ErbB2 cells, whereas highly phosphorylated in NIH 3T3-EGFR/ ErbB2 and NIH 3T3-ErbB2/ErbB3 cells. ErbB3 was slightly phosphorylated in NIH 3T3-ErbB3 cells, but highly phosphorylated in NIH 3T3-EGFR/ErbB3 and NIH 3T3-ErbB2/ErbB3 cells (Fig. 5 and Table 2). However, coexpression with ErbB2 or ErbB3 did not enhance the phosphorylation of EGFR. EGFR expression level was higher in NIH 3T3-EGFR cells than in NIH 3T3-EGFR/ErbB2 and NIH 3T3-EGFR/ErbB3 cells (Fig. 4 and Table 2), so did the EGFR phosphorylation level (Fig. 5 and Table 2). Drug resistance was positively correlated with the phosphorylation levels of the ErbB receptors, especially the phosphorylation level of ErbB2 (Table 2). NIH 3T3-EGFR/ErbB2 and NIH 3T3-ErbB2/ErbB3 cells that had high ErbB2 phosphorylation levels were most resistant to the anti-cancer drugs. NIH 3T3EGFR/ErbB3 and NIH 3T3-EGFR cells that had high EGFR or ErbB3 phosphorylation levels were moderately resistant to the drugs. NIH 3T3-ErbB2 and NIH

3T3-ErbB3 cells that had low ErbB2 or ErbB3 phosphorylation level was slightly resistant to the drugs. DISCUSSION Our cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that the various breast cancer cell lines showed a similar pattern of resistance to a broad range of anti-cancer drugs including 5-Fu, Cytoxan, Taxol, Vinorelbine, and Doxorubicin. BT20 and MCF-7 cells were most resistant, BT474 and SKBR-3 cells are moderately resistant, and MDA453 and MCF-10 cells were less resistant to the drugs (Fig. 1). Given that these drugs assert their anti-cancer effect through various mechanisms, our results suggest a mechanism of multidrug resistance. It has been well documented that P-glycoprotein is important in determining multidrug resistance in cancer cells (29, 30). Our results that the P-glycoprotein was expressed at higher levels in breast cancer cells than that in normal breast cells (Fig. 2) may account for the higher drug resistance in breast cancer cells. However, among the breast cancer cells, BT20 cells had a low P-glycoprotein expression level (Fig. 2) but were highly resistant to drug treatment, and MDA-453 cells that had a high P-glycoprotein expression level (Fig. 2) were very sensitive to drug treatment. Thus, factors other than P-glycoprotein expression levels must be important in determining drug resistance. It has been shown that high ErbB2 expression levels positively correlate with the resistance to certain anticancer drugs and radiation-therapies (15). ErbB2 is only functional following the activation by forming het-

erodimers with the other ErbB receptors (2, 17). To conclusively assay the role of ErbB2 expression in drug resistance, we examined expression levels of the three ErbB receptors including EGFR, ErbB2 and ErbB3 in these breast cancer cells. Compared with the normal breast cell MCF-10, all of the breast cancer cells expressed at least one of the ErbB receptors at moderate to high levels (Fig. 3 and Table 1), which suggests that ErbB receptor expression contributes to drug resistance. However, our results indicated that ErbB2 expression level alone was not crucial for drug resistance (Table 1). Although BT474 and SKBR-3 cells that expressed ErbB2 at very high level were more resistant to cancer drugs than MDA-453 cells that expressed ErbB2 at very low level, BT20 and MCF-7 cells that were most resistant to drug treatment expressed ErbB2 at very low level. Moreover, EGFR expression level was positively correlated with drug resistance in these breast cancer cells except in MCF-7 cells (Table 1). Given that many factors other than the ErbB receptors are also different in the breast cancer cells and may contribute to drug resistance, we selected various NIH 3T3 cell lines that specifically express various ErbB receptor or receptor combinations and examined drug resistance of these cells. These NIH 3T3 cell lines only differ in ErbB receptor expressions and therefore, our results obtained from the cell lines clearly reveal the roles of ErbB receptors in drug resistance. We found that expression of ErbB2 alone had no significant effects on drug resistance (Table 2). This result is not surprising since the function of ErbB2 is dependent on its activation and the heterodimerization with the other ErbB receptors is the mechanism allowing its activation in response to ligand stimulation (2). We further showed that coexpression of ErbB2 with EGFR or ErbB3 indeed induced strong ErbB2 activation (Fig. 5) and significantly enhanced drug resistance (Table 2). In summary, our results suggest that the resistance of breast cancer cells to anti-cancer drugs is via a mechanism of multidrug resistance and is affected by multiple factors including expression levels of P-glycoproteins and the ErbB receptors. Moreover, expression of ErbB2 alone is not enough to render the cells more resistant to anti-cancer drugs. Coexpression of ErbB2 with EGFR or ErbB3 induces strong activation of ErbB2 and renders the cells more resistant to anticancer drugs. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
