Bacterial cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases use starch to produce cyclic maltooligosaccharides (cyclodextrins) which are of interest in various applications. The cyclization reaction gives rise to a spectrum of ring sizes consisting of predominantly six to eight glucosyl units. Using the enzyme from Bacillus circulans strain no. 8, binding studies have been performed with several substrates and analogues. The observed binding modes differ in detail, but agree in general with data on homologous enzymes. Based on these binding studies, two mutations were designed that changed the production spectrum from the predominant product -cyclodextrin of the wild-type enzyme towards -cyclodextrin, which is of practical interest because it is rare and can encapsulate larger nonpolar compounds. Keywords : A-amylase inhibitor ; -cyclodextrin ; enzyme engineering; glycosyltransferase mechanism; X-ray structure analysis.

Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases (CGTases, EC 2.4.1.19) are of bacterial origin and are monomeric. They catalyze the transfer of A-D-(14)-glucopyranosyl chains, producing cyclic maltooligosaccharides according to Gn < Gn-x cGx (cyclization, coupling : n 8 ; x 6). Gn is a linear chain of n units; cG 6, cG 7 and cG8 denote the predominant A-, -, and -cyclodextrins, respectively. Much larger rings have been reported recently [1]. A concomitant reaction is the transglycosylation to other chains according to Gn Gm < Gn-x Gm+x (disproportionation, transglycosylation : n 3, m 1, x 1). The hydrolyzing activity caused by water as glucosyl acceptor is very low for the wild-type enzyme. Cyclodextrins find broad application in the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, agricultural and food industries, owing to their ability to encapsulate nonpolar compounds [2, 3]. Most valuable is -cyclodextrin (cG8) because it is rare and encapsulates larger compounds than cG6 and cG 7. CGTases resemble the more abundant A-amylases with respect to reaction and structure. Early on, four conserved regions have been detected in the sequences [4 6]. A subsequent structure analysis confirmed the homology [7, 8]. Both CGTases and A-amylases belong to glycosyl hydrolase family no. 13 [9]. Presently, the spatial structures of five CGTases are known to high

resolution [10 14]. Their chain folds are identical and can be subdivided into domains A E. Domain E exhibits sequence homology to the raw starch-binding domains of other starch-degrading enzymes [15, 16] and has been shown to interact with starch [17]. The A-amylases contain domains A C, among which domain B differs from that in the CGTases [7]. The catalytic center of all members of family no. 13 is at the C-terminal end of the (A)8-barrel constituting domain A. It contains three strictly conserved carboxylates, namely Asp229, Glu257 and Asp328 (CGTase numbers [8]). Their central importance was established by site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with crystallographic studies [18 25]. All family members retain the configuration at the anomeric carbon of the scissile bond [26, 27]. Based on kinetic studies on the CGTase from B. circulans strain no. 8, nine subsites for glucosyl units have been postulated [28]. Soaking crystals of the almost inactive mutant D229A with -cyclodextrin (cG7) yielded a maltose bound to two subsites at the active center and allowed identification of the position of the scissile bond [22]. Extending the maltose to a model of cG7 indicated about four more subsites [22], which were confirmed by subsequent studies on CGTase complexes [24, 25, 29] and extended to all nine postulated subsites [30]. Here, we report the structures of CGTase from B. circulans strain no. 8 ligated with saccharides occupying, altogether, six subsites around the transfer position. Furthermore, we describe two mutants with increased cG 8 production that were constructed on the basis of these ligated structures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Site-directed mutagenesis. For mutagenesis and expression, we used plasmid pTZ19R (Pharmacia), containing the CGTase gene together with its endogenous regulatory sequences [8]. Mutagenesis was performed by the phosphorothioate method [31] using an oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis kit (Amersham). Single-stranded template DNA was produced in Escherichia coli

strain TG1 (Amersham) using the helper phage M13KO7 (Pharmacia). Mutant clones were sequenced with the T7-sequencing kit from Pharmacia. The observed mutation frequency was around 90%. Enzyme preparation and activity. Production and purification were performed as described [7, 22, 32], yielding around 100 mg of pure enzyme for each CGTase mutant. The initial cyclization rates were determined by means of an optical assay [33, 34], using 0.1 M imidazole pH 6.8, 0.3 mM methylorange, 5 mM CaCl2 and 0.1 % (mass/vol.) soluble Zulkowsky starch (average polymerization degree 30; Merck) as assay buffer. To 3 ml assay buffer thermostated at 32°C, we added 5 100 µl enzyme solution (concentration range 400 to 4 µg/ml), and determined the time course of the absorbance decrease at 546 nm. An absorbance decrease of 0.13 (1-cm cuvette) caused by dye complexation corresponds to 0.1 mM cyclodextrin with about 10% deviations between cG6, cG7 and cG8. At higher cyclodextrin concentrations, the relationship becomes nonlinear. The CGTase unit is defined by the production of 1 µmol cyclodextrins (cG6, cG7 or cG 8) per minute under the described conditions. In order to determine the production of cG6, cG7 and cG 8 separately, we homogenized 20 ml of a 5 % (mass/vol.) potato starch (Merck) solution in 10 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.8 by boiling and stirring, adjusted the temperature to 34°C and added about 50 units of CGTase. Samples of 2 ml were drawn after 3 min, 6 min, 10 min and more, and quenched by adding 2 ml methanol. The samples were then centrifuged at 15800 g, and 3 ml of the supernatant was dried in vacuum and resuspended in 1.5 ml water at about 45°C. Samples of 40 µl were run through an HPLC column (Asahipak, NH2P 10 mm 250 mm) using a solution of 57% (by vol.) acetonitrile in water at a flow rate of 3 ml · min 1 and refractometric detection (Waters, model R401). Crystallization and soaks. Crystals of wild-type CGTase and of mutant D229A were available from earlier studies [22]. The other CGTase mutants were crystallized under wild-type conditions [7], using wild-type microcrystals as seeds. The crystals grew slowly over a period of 6 months or longer. All mutant crystals were isomorphous with those of the wild-type. They belong to space group P212121, with one molecule (684 amino acid residues, two Ca2 ions, Mr 74496) per asymmetric unit. The applied A-amylase inhibitor Hoxa (compound W46H, Hoechst, C38H64N2O27, Mr 981) consists of two pseudo-maltotriose units as shown in Fig. 1. Soaks were also carried out with partially methylated cG7 (Rameb, Wacker-Chemie) and with cG 7. Crystal soaking was performed in the crystallization drop by adding a 10-mM solution of the respective compound to a final concentration of 1 mM. The soaking process was monitored visually and, at the first signs of disintegration, the crystals were transferred to a capillary for X-ray analysis. X-ray data collection and refinement.

detector (model X1000, Siemens) with a rotating anode generator (model RU200B, Rigaku). Data were processed using the program XDS [35]. All structures were refined with the program X-PLOR [36, 37] using wild-type CGTase with the 171 most strongly bound water molecules as the starting model. In all starting models, the mutated residues (Leu194, Tyr195, Asp229) were replaced by alanines or deleted as in (145 151)D, to verify the substitution and to avoid model bias. For refinement of the ligated structures, all water molecules in the active center were removed and 20 cycles of rigid body refinement were performed, decreasing the R-factor to about 20%. The initial (Fobs Fcalc)expiAcalc map was calculated with Fcalc and Acalc from this pre-refined model. The inhibitor Hoxa was built with program O [38], using the geometry and force constants available in XPLOR for glucose, 4-glucosamine and 6-deoxyglucose [36], and the usual parameters for the epoxides. Grouped temperature factors were applied for the side and main chains of each amino acid residue and for each saccharide unit. In the refined models, all solvent molecules with (2Fobs Fcalc)expiAcalc densities below 1  were removed, and new solvent molecules were added at positions with (Fobs Fcalc)expiAcalc densities above 3  and hydrogen-bonding partners.

Fig. 2. Stereo view of the active center of CGTase mutant D229A, showing an B-glucose bound to subsite 1 and a -maltose bound to subsites 1 and 2. Given is the final (2Fobs Fcalc)expiAcalc map at a contour level of 1 . Mutant D229A shows a slow hydrolytic activity, presumably using an inverting mechanism. The subsite nomenclature is . . . 2, 1, 1, 2. . . running from the reducing to the nonreducing end of the ligated oligosaccharide, with the scissile bond between 1 and 1. It ignores previous proposals [46] and follows the established subsite nomenclature of proteases for oligopeptides [47], equating the oligosaccharide direction from the reducing to the nonreducing end [45] with the oligopeptide direction from the amino end to the carboxyl end, thus unifying the nomenclature for both types of biopolymers [42].

crystal form [7], which was extremely sensitive against exposure to linear A-glucans [22]. On soaking with cG7, the wild-type crystals were indifferent [22] because the hydrolysis rate is very low. In contrast, crystals of mutant D229A lacking one of the catalytic carboxylates deteriorated, presumably because linear A-glucans were produced by the residual hydrolytic activity (Table 1), demonstrated by the fact that a short 10-min cG7 soak resulted in a maltose bound to the active center [22]. Besides soaking, various cocrystallizations were attempted, among them one of mutant D229A with cG7. The resulting crystals contained no bound glucan, but were particularly resistant to soaking with linear A-glucans. One of these preconditioned crystals could be soaked for 120 min with 2 mM cG 7 and then be subjected to an X-ray analysis to yield data set pc-D229A :cG7 (Table 2). Its difference-Fourier map showed a glucose at the active center and two maltose molecules, one also at the active center and the other at the starch-binding domain E (Fig. 2).

Consequently, a slow hydrolysis of cG7 had occurred. The maltose at domain E stacks against Trp614 and Trp661, while its O2- and O3-atoms form hydrogen bonds to Lys650 and Asn666. This binding site is known from homologous CGTases [11, 12, 17]. In our crystals, it is at a packing contact and does not bind cG7. On binding linear A-glucans, however, the contact and, thus, the crystal deteriorates. When compared with wild-type crystals, the preconditioned ° crystals showed a relative shift of 1.4 A at this contact, leaving more space for a maltose. Presumably, mutant D229A had hydrolyzed cG 7 over the cocrystallization time and the resulting small linear A-glucans had been bound to the enzyme, enforcing this packing shift during the crystallization process. We assume that the A-glucans were subsequently cut down to glucose, which dissociated because of its lower affinity, leaving the packing shift intact. This shift then permitted maltose binding without much destruction.

Fig. 4. Stereo view of the model of Hoxa as bound to CGTase mutant L194T together with the (2Fobs-Fcalc)expiBcalc map at the 1  level. The two glucosyl units of Hoxa (Fig. 1) occupy subsites 2 and 2, and one of the N-glycosidic bonds is at the position of the scissile bond between subsites 1 and 1, with the nitrogen forming a hydrogen bond to the general acid/base catalyst Glu257.

The maltose at the active center was bound at subsites 1 and 2, together with a glucose at subsite 1, as documented in Fig. 2. The subsite nomenclature is rationalized in the legend to this figure. The initial (Fobs Fcalc)expiAcalc map showed the saccharide orientations clearly because the 6-hydroxyl groups pointed to the protein interior. After refinement, all three glucosyl units fit well to the (2Fobs Fcalc)expiAcalc map (Fig. 2). The glucose at subsite 1 stacks against Phe259 and forms hydrogen bonds as shown in Fig. 3; its pyranose-ring plane is rotated by about 90° when compared with the maltose. The glucosyl unit at subsite 1 stacks against Tyr100 and all of its hydroxyls are involved in hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3). The glucose and the maltose are not connected by a glycosidic linkage, confirming the residual hydrolyzing activity of mutant D229A. In contrast to the A(14) bonds of cG 7, the final densities show -anomeric maltoses bound to the active center and to domain E. The -anomeric state may have arisen from mutarotation during soaking, but it could also indicate that the mutation D229A had altered the mechanism of the enzyme, resulting in a slow inverting hydrolase (Table 1). It is conceivable that the missing nucleophile Asp229 [40] was replaced by a water molecule held by Asp135 at the position of the deleted carboxylate of D229A, which could attack the glycosidic bond. Asp135 is ° at a distance of 8.5 A (between the carboxylate carbons) from the putative proton donor Glu257 (Fig. 2), which is the expected distance for an inverting enzyme [41]. Binding mode of the inhibitor Hoxa. To mark further subsites, CGTase was soaked with the A-amylase inhibitor Hoxa

(KI 1 µM). The best data were obtained with mutant L194T, which had been constructed for changing the cyclodextrin product spectrum, but had actually merely diminished the activity (Table 1). The resulting (Fobs Fcalc)expiAcalc difference-Fourier map showed defined binding of all six saccharide units. Thr194 assumed a similar side-chain position as Leu194 in the wildtype ; it did not contact Hoxa. The difference density allowed the orientation of the inhibitor unambiguously with the 6-hydroxyl groups pointing to the protein interior. Hoxa occupies subsites 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 4). An oxiran-pseudo-glucosyl unit at subsite 1 and a glucosyl unit at subsite 2 could be identified unambiguously. At subsite 1 there is clearly a 6-deoxyglucosyl unit. The unit at subsite 4 lacks density at the O3- and O4atom positions and appears to be mobile. The pyranose planes at subsites 2 and 1 have similar orientations, and both are rotated by about 90° in relation to the glucosyl units at subsites 1 and 2. This confirms the respective rotation observed between the glucose at subsite 1 and the maltose at subsites 1 and 2 shown in Figs 2 and 3. As sketched in Fig. 5, the glucosyl unit at subsite 2 stacks against Phe183 and Phe259 and forms a hydrogen bond with its O2-atom to Lys232. The 6-deoxyglucosyl unit at subsite 1 corresponds to the bound glucose at this position (Fig. 2). As expected, the bridging N-atom of Hoxa sits at the position of the scissile bond and is fixed by hydrogen bonds to both Glu257 and Asp328. The oxiran-pseudo-glucosyl unit at subsite 1 stacks against Tyr100 and forms several hydrogen bonds. Its C1-atom ° is positioned 1.2 A higher in the cleft than that of the ligated maltose (Fig. 2). After splitting the glycosidic bond, the reduc-

At subsites 1, 1, and 2, the binding mode resembles, in general, that of the glucose and the maltose (Fig. 3). Note the strong interactions of the nitrogen between subsites 1 and 1 with Glu257 and Asp328.

In mutant (145 151)D, residues 145 151 are replaced by Asp151, short-cutting the long loop.

ing end is obviously drawn deeper into the cleft, where it is protected from water and can remain until an A-glucan binds to subsite 1 and picks it up. The glucosyl unit at subsite 2 is bound in the same mode as in maltose (Fig. 3). As judged from the abundance of interactions and their conservation in all analyzed structures, it seems to be the best bound saccharide unit of all. The glucosyl unit at subsite 3 stacks loosely against Tyr195 and forms some hydrogen bonds. The second oxiran-pseudo-glucosyl unit at the nonreducing end is bound to subsite 4, where it stacks loosely against Tyr89, forming no direct hydrogen bonds with the protein.

Obviously, the binding strengths at subsites 3 and 4 are lower than the others, in agreement with the fact that for geometrical reasons they have to be evacuated on cyclization. The observed good electron density for the maltononaose at subsites 4 and beyond [30] does not imply strong binding, because a neighboring molecule forms two hydrogen bonds to the glucosyl units at subsites 6 and 7, indicating a crystal artifact. As shown in Fig. 6, the bound Hoxa resembles the bound maltononaose [30] consisting of the A-amylase inhibitor acarbose at subsites 2, 1, 1 and 2, and an A-glucan chain at subsites 3, 4, etc. The N-glycosidic linkage of the acarbose, however, is not located at the position of the scissile bond, but between

Fig. 7. The (Fobs -Fcalc)expiBcalc difference density of the partially methylated -cyclodextrin Rameb soaked into crystals of CGTase mutant D229A. The contour level is at 2  and, thus, rather low for such a map. The size of the almost-closed density ring corresponds to a cG7. The density does not suffice for modeling a cG7 molecule with confidence, but obviously there are intact or possibly hydrolyzed Rameb molecules among the statistical ensemble that bind strongly to subsites 1 and 2. The model of the bound inhibitor Hoxa has been added for reference purposes.

subsites 1 and 2 [25]. With this difference, the reported binding mode of Hoxa provides novel information. Cyclization reaction. The ligated inhibitor Hoxa consists of as many saccharide units as the byproduct cG6 of the cyclization reaction. The open structure of Hoxa (Fig. 4) thus indicates the need for subsite evacuation at both ends on cyclization. The general position of the newly formed cyclodextrin was found in a soak of CGTase mutant D229A (in this case, not preconditioned) with Rameb (Table 2), a cG7 that is statistically methylated at 60% of its hydroxyl groups and not processed by CGTase. The soak yielded good electron density at subsites 1 and 2 and weaker electron density around subsites 1 and 2 (Fig. 7). The density is not continuous for the remaining three glucosyl units; it may represent a mixture of intact and hydrolyzed Rameb molecules. The suggested Rameb position agrees with the first cG7 model based on a bound maltose at subsites 1 and 2 [22] and with the ligated structure of a cG 7 derivative [42]. It is most likely that the three glucosyl units of the maltononaose that are beyond subsite 4 are in a kind of storage position, from where they move to the emptied subsites 1 and 2 for cG 7 formation. The relative 90° rotation between the two glucosyl units at subsites 1 and 1 indicates that the newly formed cG 7 will not be in a relaxed symmetric conformation, but strained with a strong twist at the scissile bond. There are numerous aromatic residues in the active center. Among them, Tyr100 and Phe259 stack to pyranose rings. The others are rather far apart from the pyranoses and appear to form an extended area of intermediate binding strength, in which the pyranoses can move [43]. Of particular significance appears to be a guideway for the A-glucan chain between Tyr89 and Tyr195, near subsites 3 and 4, and a second guideway between Phe183 and Tyr195, along which the protein-bound linear Aglucan can reach subsite 1 for cyclization. Induced-fit. As expected, A-glucan binding to the enzyme changes the hydrogen-bonding pattern in the active center and also causes an induced-fit. This induced-fit is small and is essentially identical for the complexes with glucose maltose and for Hoxa ; it does not occur on binding Rameb. It reduces the width ° of the active center cleft by about 1.5 A. In particular, the CA

atoms of Tyr195 and Asp328 at two juxtaposed loop ends have ° ° ° ° a distance of 16.0 A, 15.8 A, 14.7 A and 14.2 A in the unligated wild type, in the Rameb complex, in the glucose maltose complex and in the Hoxa complex, respectively. These contractions affect the packing contacts along the a-axis, which in the con° ° tracted crystal form varied from 93.0 A to 94.0 A. The a-axis of ° ° the wild-type crystal form ranged between 94.5 A and 95.2 A (Table 2). The contracted crystal form was obtained in the preconditioned crystals of mutant D229A (see above, data set pcD229A:cG7), in the 10-min soak with Hoxa (data set L194T:Hoxa) and in a previous 10-min soak of cG 7 with unconditioned crystals of mutant D229A [22]. As demonstrated with pc-D229A :cG7, the contracted crystal form can bind maltose at the domain E site defined by Trp614 and Trp661, near to a crystal contact (Table 2). Increase of cG8 production. The analyzed CGTase produces mostly cG 7 and a certain amount of cG8. Because of its high overall catalytic rate, the absolute rate of cG 8 production is considerable (Table 1), and an attempt to increase it by mutagenesis appeared justified. It had been demonstrated for CGTase that the transglycosylation reaction (and, therefore, most likely also the cyclization reaction) operates by a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism [27]. The enzyme binds a linear A-glucan of undefined length and splits it between subsites 1 and 1. The glucosyl units at subsites 1, 2 and beyond remain bound, while the glucosyl units at subsites 1, 2 and beyond dissociate. The enzyme-bound glycosyl chain is then transferred either to the nonreducing end of another Aglucan binding to subsite 1 (transglycosylation or disproportionation), or to the nonreducing end of its own glycosyl chain if this curls back and binds at subsite 1 (cyclization). The predominance of cG7 production could be caused either by an active center environment that favors the curling back of an enzymebound maltoheptaosyl chain or by a pre-selection among the Aglucans, favoring a binding mode that leaves a maltoheptaosyl chain bound to the enzyme. A combination of both effects is, of course, also conceivable. With respect to curling back, Tyr195 plays a central role because it participates in a guideway near subsite 3 (Fig. 6) as well as one near a putative subsite 3 (Fig. 7). Assuming that the

glycosyl chain curls back, wrapping around Tyr195, we mutated this residue to a tryptophan, expecting that a bulkier guide would favor longer chains. Indeed, mutant Y195W changed the product spectrum drastically, making cG8 the main product (Table 1). The corresponding mutant of a closely related enzyme showed a slight relative increase of cG8 at the first reported time, 1 h after incubation (Fig. 4 C of ref. [44]), but a distribution like that of the wild-type after 45 h (Table 2 of ref. [44]). We suggest that the small initial excess of cG 8 had been destroyed in favor of the more stable cG 7 during the long incubation time. Although the approach using a bulkier guide worked out in principle, it caused an overall activity decrease, and the absolute production rate of cG8 dropped to about 90% of the wild-type enzyme, limiting the mutant's value (Table 1). The structure analysis of mutant Y195W is reported in Table 2. The introduced tryptophan was clearly visible, overlapping well with the tyrosine of the wild-type (no densities shown). In a second experiment, we followed the idea of preferred A-glucan binding, refrained from manipulating in the environment of the scissile bond and focussed on the weak binding sites beyond subsite 4. In this area, we opened the active-site cleft further by replacing residues 145 151, which form a long loop (Fig. 6), by a single aspartate. The deletion was thought to produce more space for the bound glucosyl chain, the aspartate could perform the shortcut and could also help binding saccharides. The structure analysis of this mutant (145 151)D showed only local changes. The newly introduced aspartate had clear electron density, indicating a defined conformation (Fig. 6). As shown in Table 1, mutation (145 151)D did indeed change the product spectrum in favor of cG8, but not as drastically as mutation Y195W. Still, the absolute rate of cG8 production increased to about 160% because the total activity remained at a rather high level (Table 1). Conclusion. The glucose and maltose molecules observed in crystals of mutant D229A soaked with cG7 demonstrate a low hydrolytic activity in spite of the missing nucleophile Asp229 [40]. The -anomeric state of both maltoses points to an inverting mechanism that could occur if the attacking water had replaced the removed carboxyl group in D229A. The bound inhibitor Hoxa showed the N-glycosidic bond and the oxiran-pseudoglucosyl unit at the expected positions, corroborating the role of the hydrogen-bonded Glu257 as the general acid/base catalyst. This contrasts with a report on inhibitor acarbose bound to a homologous CGTase [25, 30]. Furthermore, Hoxa confirmed six subsites mapped by a maltononaose [30]. A comparison between enzyme-bound maltose and Hoxa indicates that the glucosyl unit ° at subsite 1 moves by about 1.2 A deeper into the cleft after the bound A-glucan (here Hoxa) has been split, which seems to prevent hydrolysis by this glycosyltransferase. The two reported types of mutations favoring cG8 production are almost orthogonal. Y195W represents a direct intervention at the catalytic center which caused the desired change from cG 7 to cG 8, but was of limited practical value because it decreased the absolute cG8 rate. Mutation (145 151)D, which was further away from the scissile bond and, thus, less intrusive, changed the cG7 to cG8 ratio less drastically, but increased the absolute cG 8 rate.
