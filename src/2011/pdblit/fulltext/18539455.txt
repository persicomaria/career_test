The use of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is well documented in the scientific literature.1­3 The current generation of PDE4 inhibitors, represented by Roflumilast (DaxasTM) 1, show moderate efficacy in COPD at tolerated doses, however, the maximum dose that can be given (and hence efficacy) is still limited by undesired side effects such as nausea and emesis.4 Our objective was thus to develop an oral PDE4 inhibitor with improved therapeutic index. The initial lead compound and start point was trisubstituted quinoline 2 (Fig. 1). This quinoline series was discovered from similarity searching for alternative templates to the original pyrazolopyridine template, for example, pyrazolopyridine 3 that was being worked on in GSK.5 When the first co-crystal structure of a quinoline 4 bound in the active site of the PDE4B enzyme was solved, it was discovered that the quinoline series had a different binding mode to that of the pyrazolopyridine template and that the SAR did not transfer between the two series. An overlay of pyrazolopyridine 3 and quinoline 4 bound into the active site of the PDE4 enzyme is shown in Figure 2. It shows that the two amide moieties are binding into different parts of the active site and the two amine substituents are binding into the same pocket.

This letter describes the SAR that was discovered, culminating in the identification of two compounds that had the required profile to progress into our in-vivo models to evaluate their therapeutic index with respect to nausea and emesis. Quinoline 2 has an attractive profile and is a good start point to initiate a lead optimisation programme. It has submicromolar activity against PDE4B (pIC50 = 7.0). It is greater than 300-fold selective against other PDE enzymes (PDE3 and PDE5) and has three potential points of diversity. It also has a low c log P (2.1) and moderate aqueous solubility (30 lg/mL). Unfortunately, quinoline 2 suffers from poor oral exposure in the rat. The primary emphasis of our SAR exploration was to increase the cellular activity and improve the rat oral pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. The biological profile that was targeted was: human whole blood (hWB) potency pIC50 >7.5 (inhibition of LPS induced TNFa production)8; >100-fold selective versus other PDEs; PK profile in the rat consis-

tent with once daily dosing (F > 30%; t1/2 > 2 h). The PDE4 enzyme has four sub-types: A, B, C and D, but it is the PDE4B sub-type that is believed to play a central role in inflammation,7 being the predominant subtype in monocytes and neutrophils and hence we used this isoform for routine screening. For the exemplars from this quinoline series tested against PDE4A, B, C and D, no isoform selectivity was observed. The quinoline template can be assembled in five steps from commercially available starting materials in good overall yield (Scheme 1). 4-(Methylsulphonyl)aniline 5 was condensed with diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate to give aniline derivative 6. Cyclisation at 250 °C in diphenyl ether provided ester 7 which underwent basic hydrolysis to provide the 3-carboxylic acid quinolone derivative. Chlorination of the quinolone and quenching of the resultant acid chloride with aqueous ammonia, followed by displacement of the 4-chloro group in quinoline 8 with 3-hydroxyaniline in refluxing acetonitrile gave quinoline 2.9­11 Modifications to the linker group at the 4 position were made by displacing the 4-chloro substituent in quinoline 8 (Scheme 2). The oxygen linker was introduced by displacement with a phenol and potassium carbonate in DMF. The sulphide linker was inserted by displacement with a thiol in refluxing acetonitrile with triethylamine. Modifications to the primary carboxamide were made using standard functional group transformations (Schemes 3 and 4). The primary carboxamide 4 was converted to nitrile 11 using trifluoroacetic acid anhydride and subsequently hydrogenated to afford amine 12. Quinolone ester 7 was reacted with thionyl chloride

group (e.g., pyrazolopyridine 3 PDE4B pIC50 = 7.1).16 Unfortunately, the quinoline 32 with the tetrahydropyran in the 4-position was inactive (Table 1). It was discovered that an aromatic substituent was essential for potency in this position in this quinoline series. Removal of the 4-substituent resulted in an inactive compound 33. A large number of compounds were synthesised investigating a wide range of substituents, a selection of which is detailed in Table 1. Some of the key SAR findings for PDE4B enzyme potency were:  Meta substitution on the aromatic ring was preferred by the PDE4B-binding site.  Large and bulky substituents in the ortho and para positions reduced PDE4B potency (data not shown).  Ortho substitution with small substituents was tolerated (34, 35, and 4) especially if constrained in a ring to the meta position (36).  Heterocyclic phenyl ring replacements and basic substituents reduced the log P (37 c log P = 1.6 and 38 c log P = 1.4) which was potentially advantageous for oral exposure, but they were less potent at PDE4B.  Acidic substituents on the phenyl ring were not well tolerated (39). The replacement of the metabolically vulnerable hydroxy group in quinoline 2 by a methoxy group 4 resulted in an increase in potency and an improved rat PK profile giving 10% oral bioavailability. Further improvements in the PK profile were observed by replacing the methoxy group with a nitrile 35 or constraining the methoxy group into a ring as in the dihydrobenzofuran 36. The addition of fluorine (40 and 41) onto the aryl ring resulted in improved bioavailability. Modifications to the 4-amino linker group were very detrimental to PDE4B potency (Table 2). This data indicates the potential importance of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the NH and the carbonyl group of the 3-carboxamide. This hydrogen bond is not possible with any of the other linkers that were tried, possibly contributing to their lack of PDE4B binding potency. Next the hydrogen bond donor/acceptor properties of the primary carboxamide were modified, small substituents placed on the nitrogen (11, 12a, 14a and 15) and the primary carboxamide replaced with simple aromatic heterocycles (16 and 11). Some of the compounds described in Table 3 have a phenyl sulphone group in the 6-position of the quinoline (e.g., 4a, 12a and 14a). This group was under investigation as an inhaled target early in the programme. The phenyl sulphone gave a higher PDE4B enzyme potency compared to the methyl sulphone, but was detrimental for solubility and oral PK.19 The chemistry to make the compounds with the phenyl sulphone is analogous to the chemistry to make compounds with the methyl sulphone. All of these modifications reduced the potency at PDE4B significantly (Table 3). These data showed that the 3-primary carboxamide was essential for the high binding affinity of the quinolines in the PDE4B enzyme. This was rationalised when the crystal structure of 4 bound to the catalytic domain of PDE4B was determined (Fig. 3). The primary carboxamide sits in a small binding pocket with one of the NH's hydrogen bonding to asparagine-395 in PDE4B and the other NH binding to glutamine-443 via a water molecule (Fig. 3). The carbonyl group participates in two hydrogen bonds, one to the NH of the 4-amino group and a second to an extensive water network. The intra-molecular hydrogen bond is believed to lock the quinoline into the preferred conformation to bind into the active site of the PDE4B enzyme. The crystal structure of quinoline 4 bound in the active site of the PDE4B enzyme showed the presence of a small lipophilic binding pocket beneath the 8-position of the quinoline (Fig. 4). Subse-

hydroxide in ethanol to give acid 14. Acid 14 was treated with TBTU in DMF followed by an amine to give amide 15. Acid 14 was transformed into the 1,3,4-oxadiazole 16 by treatment with an acyl hydrazide followed by cyclo-dehydration with Burgess' reagent.12 To form 1,2,4-oxadiazole 17, ester 13 was reacted with Nhydroxyethanimidamide. The synthesis of the compound with the primary carboxamide group moved to the 2-position of the quinoline is shown in Scheme 5. 4-(Methylsulphonyl)-aniline 5 was condensed with diethyl 2butynedioate at 80 °C,13 followed by similar chemistry to that which was used to prepare the 3-substituted analogues. Variation of the 8-substituent was not possible at a late stage of the synthesis so modifications were made as shown in Scheme 6. Quinolines containing the 8-methyl and 8-methoxy substituents were synthesised by displacement of an aromatic fluoride 20 and 21 with sodium methane sulphinate at 75 °C in DMA,14 followed by reduction of the nitro group to give amines 22 and 23. The synthesis then proceeded as described in Scheme 1. Condensation of aryl iodides 24­27 with diethylethoxymethylene malonate and cyclisation in diphenyl ether at 250 °C followed by ester hydrolysis, chlorination with thionyl chloride and reaction with ammonia gave intermediates 28­31. Amine displacement in refluxing acetonitrile followed by palladium-catalysed coupling with the tributyl(methylthio)stannane in refluxing toluene under palladium catalysis.15 Oxidation with OxoneÒ afforded the target compounds. Initially we investigated finding a replacement for the potentially metabolically vulnerable hydroxy substituent on the pendant aromatic ring in quinoline 2. As shown in Figure 2 the group at C-4 in the quinoline binds into the same part of the active site of the PDE4B enzyme as the cyclic substituents that gave potent compounds in the pyrazolopyridine series, such as the tetrahydopyran

quently a range of small substituents in the 8-position of the quinoline were investigated. The 8-methyl quinoline 43 was found to be 1.3 log units more potent than the unsubstituted compound in the hWB assay and it had an excellent PK profile in the rat (Table 4). Increasing the size of the 8-substituent to an ethyl or a chloro group (44 and 45) increased the potency in the enzyme assay (data not shown) but their increased lipophilicity resulted in a larger drop off into the cellular assay, resulting in compounds that were equipotent with the 8-methyl quinolines. The 8-chloro compounds suffered from a lack of oral exposure and this precluded their progression. 8-Fluoro analogue 46 was slightly less potent than 8-methyl quinoline 43 and consequently was not progressed.

These compounds are very potent inhibitors of PDE4B, they are >100-fold selective over other PDEs (PDE1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7), have some aqueous solubility, a reasonable c log P and have a good PK profile in the rat. They were progressed to our in-vivo models for further profiling to determine a therapeutic index versus emetic side effects and these results will be reported in due course.

showed a reduction in potency that was rationalised by the 8methoxy group being unfavorably twisted out of the plane of the quinoline ring to fit into the PDE4B-binding site.
