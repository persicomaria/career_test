Abstract
In bacteria, ribosomes stalled at the 30 -end of nonstop or defective mRNAs are rescued by the action of a specialized ribonucleoprotein complex composed of tmRNA and SmpB protein in a process known as trans-translation; for recent reviews see Dulebohn et al. [2007], Keiler [2007], and Moore and Sauer [2007]. tmRNA is a bifunctional RNA that acts as both a tRNA and an mRNA.

SmpB-bound tmRNA is charged with alanine by alanyl-tRNA synthetase and recognized by EF-Tu (GTP). The quaternary complex of tmRNA-SmpB-EF-Tu and GTP recognizes stalled ribosomes and transfers the nascent polypeptide to the tRNA-like domain of tmRNA. A specialized reading frame within tmRNA is then engaged as a surrogate mRNA to append a 10 amino acid (ANDENYALAA) tag to the C-terminus of the nascent polypeptide. A stop codon at the end of the tmRNA reading frame then facilitates normal termination and recycling of the translation machinery. Through this surveillance mechanism, stalled ribosomes are rescued, and nascent polypeptides bearing the C-terminal tmRNA-tag are directed for proteolysis. Several proteases (ClpXP, ClpAP, Lon, FtsH, and Tsp) are known to be involved in the degradation of tmRNA-tagged proteins (Choy et al., 2007; Farrell et al., 2005; Gottesman et al., 1998; Herman et al., 1998, 2003; Keiler et al., 1996). In addition to its ribosome rescue and peptide tagging activities, trans-translation also facilitates the selective decay of nonstop mRNAs in a process that is dependent on the activities of SmpB protein, tmRNA, and the 30 to 50 -exonuclease, RNase R (Mehta et al., 2006; Richards et al., 2006; Yamamoto et al., 2003). Here, we describe methods and strategies for the purification of tmRNA, SmpB, Lon, and RNase R from Escherichia coli that are likely to be applicable to other bacterial species. Protocols for the purification of the Clp proteases, Tsp, and FtsH, as well as EF-Tu and other essential E. coli translation factors may be found elsewhere ( Joshi et al., 2003; Kihara et al., 1996; Makino et al., 1999; Maurizi et al., 1990; Shotland et al., 2000). In addition, we present biochemical and genetic assays to study the various aspects of the trans-translation mechanism.

1. Introduction
Translation is the process by which genetic information encoded within the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA is decoded for the biosynthesis of a polypeptide. A large ribonucleoprotein machine, the ribosome, catalyzes protein synthesis with transfer RNAs (tRNAs) serving as the adaptor molecules that link mRNA codons to the amino acid sequence of nascent polypeptides. Protein synthesis takes place in three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination and is regulated by stage-specific protein factors. Initiation is the loading of ribosomes onto the mRNA through a specialized tRNA molecule (tRNAfMet) and the activities of three protein initiation factors (IF-1, IF-2, and IF-3). The 70S initiation complex contains the specialized fMet-initiator-tRNA in the ribosomal P-site and the next codon poised to be decoded in the ribosomal A-site. Elongation requires tRNAs, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, and elongation factors EF-Tu, EF-Ts, and EF-G. Polypeptide synthesis begins by sampling of the A-site codon by a ternary complex of aminoacyl-tRNA, EF-Tu, and GTP. Cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs, capable of complementary base pairing

with the awaiting A-site codon, are able to trigger GTP hydrolysis on EFTu. Release of EF-Tu-(GDP) from the ribosome permits the accommodation of aminoacyl-tRNA into the ribosomal A-site, followed by peptide bond formation. The resulting peptidyl-tRNA residing in the A-site, is translocated to the P-site through the action of EF-G and hydrolysis of GTP. Translocation positions the next codon in the A-site decoding center to start another round of aminoacyl-tRNA sampling, peptide bond formation, and translocation. Translation elongation continues until the ribosome encounters an in-frame stop codon, which signals the end the elongation phase of translation. Bacteria have three stop codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA). Two protein release factors recognize these codons (RF-1 recognizes UAA and UAG, and RF-2 recognizes UAA and UGA). These release factors bind in the ribosomal A-site and promote hydrolysis of the polypeptide-tRNA linkage, releasing the newly synthesized polypeptide. RF-3, a GTP binding protein, then binds the A-site promoting release of RF-1 or RF-2. Finally, GTP hydrolysis on RF-3 promotes the dissociation of RF-3 from the ribosome. Peptide release leaves a 70S ribosome complex with mRNA and a deacylated P-site tRNA. Disassembly of this complex into free 50S and 30S ribosomal subunits requires the action of ribosome recycling factor (RRF) and EF-G (GTP) and is necessary to initiate a new round of protein synthesis. It is important to note that the presence of an in-frame termination codon is required to elicit this elaborate process of nascent polypeptide release and ribosome recycling. Gene mutation, DNA damage, premature transcription termination, mRNA damage, and translational errors could all lead to mRNAs that lack in-frame stop codons. These nonstop mRNAs can still serve as templates for translation initiation and elongation. In the absence of a stop codon, translating ribosomes can decode to the end of an mRNA but are unable to properly terminate, recycle, or release the attached polypeptide (Fig. 17.1). Such translation blockage events could have two potentially hazardous consequences for the cell. First, because an in-frame stop codon is required to recruit the translation termination apparatus, mRNAs that lack an inframe stop codon lead to ribosome stalling and significant loss of translational efficiency. Second, aberrant protein products translated from incomplete mRNAs may be harmful to cells. How do cells deal with these nonstop mRNAs? Bacteria have evolved a unique quality control mechanism, called trans-translation, mediated by the SmpB-tmRNA complex to deal with problematic mRNAs that cause ribosome stalling (Fig. 17.1). tmRNA, the central player in trans-translation, is a small stable RNA consisting of an alanyl-tRNA-like domain linked to an mRNA-like domain encoding a short reading frame followed by a stop codon (Fig. 17.2). tmRNA is recruited in a complex with its requisite protein cofactor, SmpB, to stalled ribosomes (Karzai et al., 1999; Sundermeier and Karzai, 2007).

Figure 17.1 Trans-translation. Ribosomes stall either at the 30 -end of a nonstop message or at internal positions on the mRNA. Pausing at internal positions is thought to elicit an mRNA cleavage event, generating a nonstop mRNA. Both types of ribosome stalling are alleviated by the action of SmpB protein and tmRNA through a mechanism known as trans-translation. Trans-translation results in rescue of stalled ribosomes, directed degradation of the aberrant protein product, and facilitated decay of the mRNA.

acylated-tRNA­like domain of tmRNA is recognized by EF-Tu (GTP), enters the ribosomal A-site, and transfers the nascent polypeptide chain to the alanine charge of the tRNA-like domain of tmRNA to initiate the transtranslation process (Barends et al., 2001; Rudinger-Thirion et al., 1999). The short reading frame of the mRNA-like domain is then engaged as a surrogate mRNA, providing stalled ribosomes with an alternate means for elongation, termination, and recycling. In addition, the released nascent polypeptide is extended by an 11-amino acid (A-ANDENYALAA) C-terminal tag that is recognized by ClpXP, ClpAP, and Lon proteases and rapidly degraded (Choy et al., 2007; Farrell et al., 2005; Gottesman et al., 1998; Herman et al., 1998, 2003; Keiler et al., 1996). A number of additional conditions could lead to nonproductive pausing of the translation machinery and elicit trans-translation (Fig. 17.1). It is not clear how long such translation blockage events must persist before the

tmRNA surveillance system is activated. It is known that under some circumstances nonproductive ribosome stalling events lead to cleavage of the causative mRNA in the ribosomal A-site (Hayes and Sauer 2003; Hayes et al., 2002a, 2002b; Richards et al., 2006; Sunohara et al., 2002, 2004a, 2004b). However, the endonuclease(s) involved has not yet been identified. Our current understanding is that the SmpB-tmRNA complex recognizes these A-site vacant stalled ribosomes to commence the transtranslation process, leading to ribosome rescue, selective nonstop mRNA decay, and protein tagging for directed proteolysis (Fig. 17.1). The universal presence of the SmpB-tmRNA system in eubacteria suggests that it confers a significant selective advantage. Indeed, recent studies of SmpB and tmRNA mutants in several bacterial species suggest that tmRNA activity is required for normal cellular physiology. In Escherichia coli, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Bacillus subtilis, tmRNA is required for optimal growth under a variety of nutritional and environmental stress conditions (Karzai et al., 1999; Muto et al., 2000; Okan et al., 2006; Shin and Price 2007). In Caulobacter crescentus, tmRNA activity is required for efficient cell-stage­specific developmental transitions (Keiler and Shapiro 2003). In addition, tmRNA activity is shown to be essential for growth of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Huang et al., 2000), Haemophilus influenzae (Akerley et al., 2002), and species of Mycoplasma (Glass et al., 2006; Hutchison et al., 1999). Most intriguingly, tmRNA mutants in Salmonella enterica (Baumler et al., 1994; Julio et al., 2000) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Okan et al., 2006) have decreased virulence. In Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, loss of SmpB and tmRNA function leads to severe defects in the expression and delivery of virulence effector proteins (Okan et al., 2006). These findings suggest an important regulatory role for the SmpB-tmRNA surveillance system in bacterial fitness and survival under a variety of stress conditions.

2. Methodology
In recent years, a number of genetic, molecular, and biochemical approaches have been developed to study the tmRNA-mediated surveillence mechanism. We will describe some of the methods and assays used in our research to study tmRNA, the trans-translation process, and its
aimed at separating the tRNA- and mRNA-like activities of tmRNA. tmRNA truncation variants are also commonly used for binding studies as both SmpB and EF-Tu proteins bind the tRNA-like domain. (C) tmRNAH6 and tmRNADD carry substitutions in the mRNA-like domain of tmRNA, changing the amino acid sequence of the tag peptide. Both variants stabilize tmRNA-tagged proteins against proteolysis, facilitating their detection in cells.

associated protein factors. These methods and assays are based on both modification of existing techniques and development of new approaches. The methods described herein are best suited for evaluating the various aspects of the trans-translation process, including SmpB-tmRNA interactions, recognition of stalled ribosomes, selective decay of defective mRNAs, and targeted degradation of tmRNA tagged proteins.

2.1. Purification of SmpB protein
E. coli SmpB protein, overexpressed in the absence of tmRNA, is insoluble. We developed the pET28-BA expression plasmid to coexpress soluble SmpB protein and tmRNA (Karzai and Sauer, 2001). The smpB and ssrA (the gene encoding tmRNA) genes are present in tandem on the E. coli chromosome. We have cloned these genes into the pET28b expression vector (Novagen) under the control of a T7 promoter. The genes were cloned such that the SmpB protein expressed from the construct carries an N-terminal 6-Histidine (6-His) epitope. The resultant plasmid (pET28-BA) is used for purification of SmpB and tmRNA, as well as in vivo activity assays. We use a two-step strategy to purify SmpB protein, including both affinity and cation exchange chromatography steps. For SmpB purification, 6 L of BL21(DE3)/pLysS/ pET28-BA cells are grown at 37  C in Luria Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 50 mg/ml kanamycin and 30 mg/ml chloramphenicol, to an OD OD600 that is between 0.5 and 0.7. SmpB and tmRNA expression is induced by addition of isopropyl b-D-1­thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to 1 mM final concentration. Cells are grown for an additional 3 h at 37  C and harvested by centrifugation. Alternately, cells may be grown overnight ($16 h) in ZYM-5052 autoinducing medium and harvested (Studier, 2005). Cells are resuspended in 60 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 M NH4Cl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM b-mercaptoethanol (b-ME), and 10 mM imidazole). The high NH4Cl concentration disrupts SmpB-tmRNA interactions allowing purification of free SmpB. Cells are separated into two 50 ml conical tubes and lysed with three 30 sec sonication pulses. Between each sonication pulse, 100 ml of 100 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) is added to prevent proteolysis, and the lysate is left on ice for at least 1 min before the next pulse. Cell debris is removed by centrifugation at 30,000g for 1 h, and 1 ml of 50% Ni2þ-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) (preequilibrated in lysis buffer) is added to the supernatant and rotated for 1 h at 4  C. The cell lysate/Ni2þ-NTA slurry is applied to a 35 ml Econo-chromatography column (BioRad), and the resin is allowed to settle. Unbound material is allowed to flow through by gravity and collected. The resin is washed three times with 20 ml of lysis buffer. To remove nonspecifically bound material, it is important to completely resuspend the resin in lysis buffer with each 20 ml wash, allow it to settle, and then allow the dislodged material to flow through. The resin is washed once more with buffer W (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM

336

Thomas Sundermeier et al.

KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM b-ME, and 10 mM imidazole) to remove excess salt and prepare the resin for the elution step. SmpB is eluted in three steps with 5 ml of elution buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM b-ME, and 200 mM imidazole). With each 5 ml elution step, the resin is resuspended in elution buffer, allowed to settle for 5 min, and the eluted material is collected. Protein-containing fractions are pooled, and the volume is raised to 50 ml with buffer A (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM b-ME). It is important to remove any insoluble material present in the eluted sample by centrifugation at 30,000g for 30 min. The second step in the SmpB purification process is a cation exchange step performed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) with a MonoS (HR10/10) column (GE Healthcare). The FPLC column is washed and equilibrated in buffer A (see earlier). The cleared SmpB containing sample is applied to the column, and unbound material is removed by washing with 5 bed volumes of FPLC buffer A. SmpB is eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 75% of buffer B (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM b-ME). SmpB elutes as a single peak at approximately 450 mM KCl. Purified SmpB is concentrated and exchanged into storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM b-ME, and 5% [v/v] glycerol) with a 15 ml Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device with a 5-kDa molecular weight cutoff (Millipore). The product is then aliquoted, flash frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at À80  C. The typical yield from this procedure is approximately 500 nmol of SmpB protein at greater than 95% purity.

2.2. Purification of tmRNA
Purified preparations of tmRNA may be generated either by in vitro transcription and purification or by purifying from cells overexpressing tmRNA. tmRNA contains several modified nucleotides in its tRNA-like domain (Felden et al., 1998). tmRNA purified from cells should possess these modified bases, making cell purification the preferred method for tmRNA isolation. We generally purify full-length tmRNA from cells but use in vitro transcription to generate tmRNA truncation variants (Fig. 17.2) for binding studies or other functional assays. Because tmRNA undergoes extensive posttranscriptional modification (50 - and 30 -end processing and modification of the D-loop and T-arm bases), care must be taken in choosing the method of tmRNA expression to isolate a pure preparation of mature tmRNA. Full induction of tmRNA expression may lead to a mixture of the pre-tmRNA transcript and the mature form. For purifying tmRNA from cells, we first express and purify the SmpBtmRNA complex. This approach has two advantages. First, SmpB stabilizes tmRNA within cells. Second, this approach allows for an initial Ni2þ-NTA affinity step, purifying the SmpB-tmRNA complex on the basis of the 6-His

epitope attached to SmpB. Six liters of BL21(DE3)/pLysS/pET28-BA cells are grown to OD600 of $0.5 in LB broth supplemented with 10 mM IPTG, 50 mg/ml kanamycin and 30 mg/ml chloramphenicol. Ni2þ-NTA purification is accomplished as described previously except that the NH4Cl concentration in the lysis buffer is reduced from 1 M to 100 mM, and a total of 500 ml of 50% Ni2þ-NTA resin slurry is used. The Ni2þ-NTA eluate fractions are combined and concentrated down to 5 ml with an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device with a 30-kDa MW cutoff (Millipore). tmRNA is separated from SmpB by RNA extraction with 15 ml of TriReagent LS (Molecular Research Center) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA is then resuspended in 10 ml of FPLC buffer A (see earlier) and loaded onto an FPLC MonoQ (HR10/10) anion exchange column. tmRNA is eluted with a linear gradient of 30 to 100% FPLC buffer B (see earlier) over 30 bed volumes. tmRNA elutes at approximately 650 mM KCl. Additional smaller peaks of contaminating material elute at higher salt concentrations. tmRNA containing fractions are pooled, a 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate is added, and tmRNA is precipitated with isopropanol. tmRNA-containing pellets are washed with 75% ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer. The typical yield of tmRNA is approximately 10 nmol. Wild-type tmRNA or tmRNA variants may also be generated by in vitro runoff transcription. We transcribe tmRNA with T7 RNA polymerase using dsDNA PCR products as the transcription template. The following protocol describes the production of tmRNA113, a tmRNA truncation variant containing the tRNA-like domain of tmRNA but lacking the three pseudoknots and the mRNA-like reading frame (Fig. 17.2B). Two primers representing the 50 - and 30 -ends of the tmRNA113 coding sequence (with overlapping complementary sequence) are extended by PCR with Pfu-Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). This PCR extension product is used as template in a second PCR reaction using a 50 -primer designed to add the T7 promoter consensus sequence immediately 50 of the first transcribed base. This PCR product is gel purified and used as template for in vitro transcription. We generally use the template DNA derived from one 100 ml PCR reaction as template for one transcription reaction. However, increasing the DNA template concentration may, in some cases, improve the RNA yield of the transcription reaction. In vitro transcription reactions are performed in an in vitro transcription buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 26 mM MgCl2, 1 mM spermidine, 0.01% [v/v] Triton X-100, and 1 mM DTT). The reaction mixture (100 ml) contains the template DNA, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM CTP, 2 mM GTP, 2 mM UTP, 2.5 mM GMP, and 100 units of T7 RNA polymerase (USB). RNase inhibitors may also be added to the transcription reaction to control any potential low-level RNase contamination. Reaction mixtures are incubated at 37  C for 3 h. Template DNA is removed by adding 10 ml of RNase-free DNase I (GE Healthcare) and incubating at 37  C for an additional 30 min. Transcription reaction

products (tmRNA113) are purified by electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrylamide gels (SequaGel, National Diagnostics). An equal volume (100 ml) of gel loading dye (8 M urea, 10% [v/v] glycerol, 50 mM TrisHCl, pH7.5, 0.05% [w/v] bromophenol blue) is added to the transcription reaction product, loaded onto a 12% sequagel, and run at 200 V until the bromophenol blue front reaches the bottom of the gel (3 to 4 h). UV shadowing, aided by fluorophore-coated TLC plates (Ambion), is used to visualize RNA bands. The fraction of the gel containing tmRNA113 is cut out of the gel with a clean razor blade and cut into small sections (approximately 0.5 cm2). Each gel section is then placed into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and crushed into smaller pieces with a pipette tip; 600 ml of gel elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 300 mM sodium acetate) is added to each tube and gently mixed overnight on a rotator at 4  C. The gel slices are pelleted by centrifugation at 18,000g in a microcentrifuge for 5 min. The supernatant is transferred to a new tube and precipitated by adding 2.5 volumes of cold 100% ethanol and incubating for 3 h at À20  C. tmRNA samples are resuspended in TE buffer and stored at À80  C. In vitro transcription reaction yields are often variable and depend on the activity of the specific lot of T7 RNA polymerase used.

2.3. Purification of RNase R
We use a three-step strategy to purify RNase R, including affinity, cation exchange, and size exclusion chromatography steps. For RNase R purification, 3 L of BL21(DE3) rnbÀ/plysS/pET15b-rnr cells are grown at 37  C in Luria Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin and 30 mg/ml chloramphenicol to an OD OD600 that is between 0.5 and 0.7. RNase R expression is induced by addition of IPTG to 1 mM final concentration. Cells are grown for an additional 3 h at 30  C. Cultures are harvested by centrifugation at 3000g for 60 min at 4  C, and the resulting cell pellet stored at À80  C. The frozen cell pellet is thawed on ice and resuspended in 60 ml of a lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM b-ME). Cells are separated into two 50 ml conical tubes and lysed with three 30 sec sonication pulses. After each sonication pulse, 100 ml of 100 mM PMSF is added to prevent proteolysis, and the lysate is left on ice for at least 1 min before the next pulse. The lysate is centrifuged at 30,000g for 1 h at 4  C. The supernatant is collected and filtered through a 0.45 mm syringe filter. 2.3.1. Affinity chromatography The resulting cleared lysate is then applied to a preequilibrated 5 ml HiTrap Blue HP FPLC column (GE Healthcare). Unbound material is removed by washing with 10 bed volumes of buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM b-ME, 150 mM KCl).

Bound RNase R is eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 75% buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM b-ME, 1 M KCl). A broad RNase R peak is observed between 300 and 500 mM KCl. Fractions containing the purest RNase R sample are then pooled and diluted to 300 mM KCl with dilution buffer R (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM b-ME). With this approach, we routinely observe a strong absorbance peak at 260 nm for this sample, suggesting that RNase R is associated with cellular RNA. The protein­ RNA complex is incubated at 37  C for 1 h to degrade the associated RNA. 2.3.2. Cation exchange chromatography After incubation, the RNase R sample is cooled to 4  C, filtered through a 0.45 mm syringe filter, and applied to a preequilibrated MonoS HR10/10 FPLC column (GE Healthcare). Unbound material is removed by washing with 5 bed volumes of buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM b-ME, 100 mM KCl). RNA-free RNase R is eluted at approximately 500 to 550 mM KCl on application of a linear gradient of 0 to 70% buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM b-ME, 1 M KCl). 2.3.3. Gel filtration chromatography RNase R­containing fractions are pooled and concentrated with a 15 ml Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device with a 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff (Millipore). The concentrated protein is applied to a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), preequilibrated with RNase R storage buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM KCl, 0.25 mM MgCl2, 2 mM b-ME, 10% [v/v] glycerol). RNase R, with greater than 95% purity, elutes as a single peak from this column. Purified RNase R is concentrated with a 15 ml Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device with a 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff (Millipore). The purified protein is aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at À80  C. The typical yield from this procedure is approximately 300 nmol of purified RNase R protein. 2.3.4. RNase R purification: Alternate procedure for obtaining RNA-free protein The affinity chromatography and cation exchange chromatography steps are the same as described previously, except the 37  C incubation, after MonoS purification, is replaced with a dialysis step. Concentrated RNase R containing sample is placed in a 3.5-kDa molecular weight cutoff Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce) and dialyzed against 4 L of dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM b-ME, 10% [v/v] glycerol) at room temperature for 24 h. The rationale for this step is that RNase R will degrade the associated RNA during dialysis, and the released nucleotides can diffuse away. Indeed, the absorbance spectrum of the

postdialysis RNase R sample does not contain an absorbance peak at 260 nm. This step is followed by the gel filtration chromatography step described previously.

2.4. Purification of Lon
We use C-terminally 6-His­tagged Lon protease for most of our studies. In our experience, placing a 6-His-tag on the N-terminus of Lon protease from E. coli, and several other bacterial species, leads to inactivation of the protein. In contrast, a C-terminal 6-His tag has no significant effect on Lon activity. We purify C-terminally 6-His­tagged Lon from E. coli strain CH1019 (Hayes and Sauer 2003) carrying a Lon expression plasmid by Ni2þ-NTA affinity and MonoQ (GE Healthcare) anion exchange chromatography steps. Three liters of CH1019/pET21b-Lon-6-His cells are grown at 37  C in LB broth supplemented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin to OD600 between 0.5 and 0.7. Lon expression is induced with 1 mM IPTG for 2 h at 37  C. Cell pellets are resuspended in lysis buffer (1 M NH4Cl, 20 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM b-ME, 20 mM imidazole) and lysed by sonication. Cell debris is removed by centrifugation at 30,000g for 1 h, and 1 ml of 50% Ni2þ-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) (preequilibrated in lysis buffer) is added to the supernatant and rotated for 1 h at 4  C. The cell lysate/Ni2þ-NTA slurry is applied to a 35 ml Econo chromatography column (BioRad), and the resin is allowed to settle. Unbound material is allowed to flow through by gravity. Resin is washed three times with a total of 60 ml of lysis buffer. The resin is washed once more with buffer W (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM bME, and 20 mM imidazole) to remove excess salt and prepare the resin for the elution step. Lon is eluted in three steps with 5 ml of elution buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM b-ME, and 200 mM imidazole). With each 5 ml elution step, the resin is resuspended in elution buffer, allowed to settle for 5 min, and the eluted material is collected. Lon-6-His-containing fractions are pooled, clarified by centrifugation, and applied onto a MonoQ column in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM b-ME, 10% [v/v] glycerol). Lon protease is eluted from the column on application of a linear gradient of 0 to 60% buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 M KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM b-ME, 10% [v/v] glycerol). The absence of contaminating proteins is verified by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. Lon-containing fractions are concentrated and exchanged into storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM b-ME, and 10% [v/v] glycerol) using a 15mL Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device with 30-kDa molecular weight cutoff (Millipore). Concentrated protein samples are flash frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at À80  C. The typical yield from this procedure is approximately 400 nmol of purified Lon protein.

3. Activity Assays
We have developed several assays to study different aspects of the transtranslation mechanism. SmpB and tmRNA are required for lytic development of two phages, namely limmP22 dis c2­5 hybrid phage and a temperature-sensitive variant of phage Mu (MuCTS) (Karzai et al., 1999; Ranquet et al., 2001; Retallack et al., 1994; Withey and Friedman, 1999). Analysis of the ability of E. coli mutants to support induction of these phages represents a simple assay for trans-translation activity that is amenable to high-throughput screening. In vivo trans-translation activity may also be directly assayed by looking at its protein products under normal growth conditions with the tmRNAH6 endogenous tagging assay. Association of components of the tmRNA quaternary complex with ribosomes may be assessed through a ribosome copurification assay. Binding of quaternary complex components to tmRNA is assayed with electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We have developed protein and mRNA stability assays to study the proteolysis and mRNA decay activities of trans-translation. Finally, we have developed a stalled ribosome enrichment protocol to identify additional components of the SmpB-tmRNA­stalled ribosome complex.

3.1. Phage induction assays
MuCts is a temperature-sensitive variant of phage Mu that requires SmpB and tmRNA for its lytic development (Karzai et al., 1999; Ranquet et al., 2001). MuCts induction assays may be used to monitor activity of the transtranslation system. Mu lysogens are grown at 30  C to OD600 of 0.4 to 0.5 then transferred to 42  C. Induction of lytic development is assayed by monitoring the OD600 of the cultures at 20 min time intervals for 2 h. Clearing of the culture caused by efficient MuCts induction suggests an intact trans-translation system, whereas cell survival indicates that transtranslation function might be impaired (Karzai et al., 1999). limmP22 dis c2­5 hybrid phage induction assays provide a more quantitative assessment of trans-translation system function; 3 ml of E. coli culture is grown at 37  C to saturation in LB supplemented with 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM CaCl2. Four separate titrations of phage are prepared at dilutions between 10À2 and 10À9, depending on phage titer, in LB with 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM CaCl2; 100 ml of each phage dilution is added to a separate 5 ml culture tube, and 500 ml of bacterial culture is added to each tube. Samples are mixed gently and incubated for 30 min at 37  C, with tubes being gently mixed every 10 min; 4 ml of 0.7% top agar in LB (supplemented with 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM CaCl2 immediately before use) is added to each tube, mixed, and plated on LB agar plates, and cells are

342

Thomas Sundermeier et al.

grown at 37  C overnight. Phage induction results in the formation of plaques in the bacterial lawn within the top agar. Counting of plaques formed at each phage dilution gives a quantitative assessment of phageinduced cell lysis. Lysis suggests that the trans-translation system is active. The trans-translation dependence of limmP22 dis c2­5 hybrid phage induction may also be used for high-throughput screening with a phage cross-streaking assay (Fig. 17.3). This method is less quantitative than that described previously but more amenable to assessing trans-translation system activity in a large number of mutant strains (Choy et al., 2007). SmpB and tmRNA functions are required for lytic development of the limmP22 dis c2-5 hybrid phage but not for lytic development of the related limmP22 dis c1-7 phage (Choy et al., 2007; Karzai et al., 1999; Retallack et al., 1994; Withey and Friedman, 1999). Analysis of phage induction phenotypes of mutant strains with both hybrid phages allows for elimination of candidates with phage biology defects. Phage-containing solutions (at appropriate

Phage is spotted at the center of each lane on an agar plate, and cells are streaked across the spot. If the strain is sensitive to hybrid phage induction, cell lysis is observed in the area around the phage spot. Strains resistant to the phage exhibit continuous growth along the line of the streak.

dilutions depending on phage titer) are spotted at the center of each lane on an LB agar plate. Mutant strains are then streaked across the lane, and the plates are incubated overnight at 37  C. The absence of bacterial cell growth in the area surrounding the spotted phage is indicative of cell lysis by phage induction (Fig. 17.3). Strains that are lysed by the limmP22 dis c1-7 phage but resistant to limmP22 dis c2-5 phage are likely to exhibit defects in transtranslation system activity.

3.2. Endogenous tmRNAH6 tagging assay
Trans-translation system activity may also be studied directly in vivo by monitoring the accumulation of tmRNA-tagged protein products by use of the endogenous tmRNAH6 tagging assay. The endogenous tagging assay uses a variant of tmRNA (tmRNAH6) with mRNA-like sequence mutated such that the last six amino acids of the tag peptide are histidines (Fig. 17.2C). Cotranslational addition of the tmRNAH6 tag to the C-termini of target proteins renders them more resistant to proteolysis and simpler to purify by Ni2þ-NTA affinity chromatography (Dulebohn et al., 2006; Sundermeier et al., 2005). We have mutated the ssrA gene in pET28-BA plasmid to code for the tmRNAH6 variant (pET28-BAH6). We use the endogenous tmRNAH6 tagging activity to test the activity of SmpB protein variants, but the technique may be extended to study the effect of mutations to any component of trans-translation; 50 ml cultures of DsmpB(DE3) cells carrying the pET28-BAH6 construct, exhibiting various mutations to smpB, are grown at 37  C to late log phase (OD600 ¼ 0.8 to 1.0) under continuous low level (5 mM) IPTG induction. Cells are harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of ET buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM KPO4, pH 8, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mM b-ME). Resuspended cells are lysed by rocking at room temperature for 1 h, and cellular debris is removed by centrifugation at 30,000g for 1 h. The supernatant is added to 200 ml of 50% Ni2þ-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) preequilibrated in ET buffer. The soluble lysate/ Ni2þ-NTA agarose slurry is incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Slurries are applied to a Micro-Bio-Spin chromatography column (BioRad) and allowed to flow through by gravity. The resin is washed four times with 1 ml of ET buffer. After the final wash, the column is placed into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 1 min at 3000g to remove excess ET buffer. His-tagged proteins are eluted in 200 ml of elution buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM acetic acid, 20 mM b-ME). Resin is resuspended in elution buffer, incubated at room temperature for 2 min, and the eluate is collected by centrifugation at 3000g for 1 min. The eluate pH is neutralized by the addition of 1/10 volume (20 ml) of 2 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.5. tmRNAH6-tagged proteins are resolved by electrophoresis in a 15% Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gel, transferred to PVDF membrane, and Western blots are developed with an antibody specific to the 6-His epitope. Figure 17.4 shows endogenous

tmRNAH6 tagging phenotypes of smpB, relEB, and dinJ-yafQ mutants alongside the otherwise isogenic parental (WT) E. coli strain. As expected, no tmRNA tagging activity is observed in cells lacking SmpB protein, whereas tagging activity is observed for all other strains.

3.3. SmpB-tmRNA interactions with electrophoretic mobility shift assay
An essential early step in the trans-translation mechanism is association of SmpB with tmRNA and EF-Tu (GTP) to form the quaternary complex that recognizes and binds stalled ribosomes to initiate the ribosome rescue and protein-tagging activities. Association of these components may be studied in vitro with an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The following is a protocol for studying SmpB-tmRNA interactions. Because of the small size of SmpB (18.3 kDa) and the large size of tmRNA (117 kDa), binding of one molecule of SmpB to one molecule of tmRNA produces only a small and difficult-to-resolve shift in electrophoretic mobility. To get around this technical challenge, we have engineered a series of tmRNA truncation variants that possess confirmed and putative SmpB binding sites (Fig. 17.2B). A variety of evidence points to interaction of SmpB protein with bases within the tRNA-like domain (TLD) of tmRNA. As such, we

Endogenously tagged proteins from a wild-type E. coli strain and from three mutant strains are shown. SmpB protein is required for trans-translation; hence, no endogenously tagged proteins are detected in smpB cells. In contrast, the other mutants show no defect in endogenous tagging activity.

study this interaction with tmRNA113, a tmRNA variant containing the TLD but lacking all pseudoknots and mRNA sequence (Fig. 17.2B). 3.3.1. tmRNA labeling We use the terminal tRNA nucleotidyl transferase catalyzed ATP-pyrophosphate exchange reaction to 30 -end label tmRNA and tmRNA variants (Fig. 17.2B) with 32P. The labeling reaction (100 ml) contains 50 mM glycine, pH 9, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate (NaPPi), approximately 100 pmol of tmRNA113, 10 mM [a32P]-ATP (3000 Ci/ mmol), and 1 mg of purified terminal tRNA nucleotidyl transferase (Sundermeier et al., 2005). Reactions are incubated at 37  C for 15 min. Subsequently, 5 units of yeast pyrophosphatase (Sigma) are added and reactions are incubated at 37  C for an additional 1 min before quenching with TriReagent LS (MRC). RNA is extracted by use of manufacturer's instructions, resuspended in TE buffer, aliquoted, and stored at À80  C. 3.3.2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay 30 -end­labeled tmRNA113 (10 to 20 pM) is incubated with varying concentrations of purified SmpB in a gel shift buffer containing 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 300 mM KCl, 2 mM b-ME, 100 mg/ml BSA, 0.01% (v/v) NP-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 200 nM total-E. coli tRNA (included as nonspecific competitor). Reactions are incubated for 30 min at 4  C then loaded onto native 12% polyacrylamide gels (run in 1/2Â TBE, pH 7.5). Gels are dried and exposed to PhosphorImager screens. PhosphorImager data are collected with a Storm840 PhosphorImager and analyzed with ImageQuant Tools (Molecular Diagnostics). Figure 17.5 shows a typical

3.4. Ribosome association assay
Another important experimentally separable activity of the trans-translation system is binding of the SmpB-tmRNA-EF-Tu (GTP) quaternary complex to stalled ribosomes. Association of components of the quaternary complex with ribosomes may be monitored through ribosome copurification assays. Care must be taken in the choice of stringencies used for ribosome purification, because many ribosome-associated factors, including SmpB, are highly basic proteins. Therefore, ionic stringency at least similar to that encountered in the cytosol must be maintained throughout the ribosome purification process to eliminate nonspecific charge interactions between basic proteins and the ribosome (Sundermeier and Karzai, 2007). A variety of different protocols are available for ribosome purification. Most separate ribosomes from other cellular components on the basis of their high density, by use of density gradient centrifugation or pelleting of ribosomes by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. The following protocols describe purification of tight-coupled 70S ribosomes, 70S ribosomes, and 50S and 30S ribosomal subunits. Association of protein and RNA components with these ribosome preparations may be assayed by Western and Northern blot analysis, respectively. E. coli culture (750 ml) is grown in LB to an OD600 of approximately 0.8. Cells are harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 ml of cold ribosome buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 6 mM b-ME). Cells are lysed by French press, with one pass of 2 min duration in a 25 ml cell (Sim-Aminco Spectronic Instruments). Cell debris is removed by centrifugation at 30,000g for 1 h at 4  C; 20 ml of the supernatant (S30 extract) is then layered onto 20 ml of a 32% sucrose cushion in ribosome buffer A. Ribosomes are pelleted by centrifugation at 120,000g for 22 h at 4  C. We use a Beckman Type 45Ti rotor in a Beckman-Coulter L100 XP Optima ultracentrifuge, but the protocol may be adapted to many different ultracentrifuges and rotors. The pellet from this centrifugation step is known as tight-coupled 70S ribosomes. The pellet is washed with 5 ml of ice-cold ribosome buffer A. A thin layer of lipid contamination is generally present on top of the clear ribosome pellet. This may be removed by pipetting up and down during the 5 ml wash. Tightcoupled 70S ribosomes are resuspended in 500 ml of buffer A by incubating at 4  C for 2 to 3 h, with gentle mixing every 30 min. Alternately, 70S ribosomes may be isolated by density gradient centrifugation. For this method, S30 extract is prepared as previously. Ribosomes are pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000g for 4 h at 4  C (without a sucrose cushion). The pellet from this centrifugation step is known as crude ribosomes.

Studying tmRNA

347

The crude ribosome pellet is washed twice with 5 ml of ribosome buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 6 mM b-ME). The thin layer of lipids on top of the crude ribosome pellet is removed as described previously, although the crude ribosome pellet remains cloudy. Next, the crude ribosomes are resuspended in 500 ml of ribosome buffer A. Approximately 400 A260 units (or 10 mmol) of crude ribosomes is layered onto a 38 ml, 10 to 50% sucrose gradient in ribosome buffer A. Gradients are prepared with the Gradient Master-107 gradient maker (Biocomp). The gradient is then subjected to centrifugation at 60,000g for 16 h in a Beckman SW28 swinging bucket ultracentrifuge rotor. The gradients are fractionated drop wise by piercing the bottom of the tube with a 25-gauge needle and collecting fractions of approximately 300 ml. The A260 of each gradient fraction is measured with a microplate reader, with UV transparent 96-well microplates. 70S ribosomes migrate as a single sharp peak near the center of the gradient. Fractions representing the top third of the 70S peak are pooled and analyzed for association of SmpB, tmRNA or other quaternary complex components. Association of trans-translation factors with 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits may also be monitored by dissociating tight-coupled 70S ribosomes, or crude ribosomes, into their component subunits. This is accomplished by incubating 70S ribosomes, or a mixed population of ribosomes, in buffer containing a low (1 mM ) magnesium concentration. Crude ribosomes are prepared as described previously but washed and resuspended in 500 ml ribosome buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NH4Cl, 1 mM MgCl2, 6 mM b-ME). Four hundred A260 units of crude ribosomes are layered onto 38 ml of a 10 to 40% sucrose gradient in ribosome buffer C and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000g for 16 h. The A260 of each fraction is measured as described previously. This time the A260 profile of fractions resolves into two distinct peaks. A smaller peak localizes in the top third of the gradient volume and corresponds to 30S subunits. A larger peak, corresponding to the large (50S) ribosomal subunit migrates farther down the density gradient. Again, fractions corresponding to the top third of each peak are pooled and analyzed for association of SmpB, tmRNA, or other quaternary complex components.

3.5. Stalled ribosome enrichment assay
We have developed protocols for isolation of pools of ribosomes enriched for those that are stalled on either nonstop or rare codon-containing mRNAs (Sundermeier and Karzai, 2007). This stalled ribosomeenrichment procedure allows us to address what ribosome interactions are specific to trans-translation. We have generated plasmids that overexpress nonstop ( l-cI-NS) or rare codon-containing (l-cI-N-4-AGG) mRNAs but also code for N-terminal 6-His epitopes. Expression of these constructs

348

Thomas Sundermeier et al.

leads to ribosome stalling, either at the rare codon region or at the end of the nonstop mRNAs. Having already translated the N-terminus of the reporter protein product, the stalled ribosomes then display the 6-His epitope, enabling Ni2þ-NTA affinity purification (Fig. 17.6). It should be noted that the product of this purification is not expected to contain only stalled ribosomes, because ribosomes might be captured at any point beyond translation of the N-terminal 6-His epitope. However, because the stalled state is expected to be the most kinetically long-lived state between 6-His epitope translation and peptide release, this pool of ribosomes should be greatly enriched for stalled ribosomes. Reporter mRNAs are overexpressed in an E. coli strain maintaining either pl-cI-N-AGG or pl-cI-NS; 1.5 L of culture is grown to an OD600 of 1.0, and expression of the reporter mRNA is induced with 1 mM IPTG for 45 min. Cells are harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 15 ml of enrichment buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM b-ME, 10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NH4Cl). Cells are lysed by French press (1 pass, 2 min, 25 ml cell). The gentle French press lysis and high magnesium concentrations are both important for keeping stalled ribosome complexes intact. Ribosomes are purified by the tight-coupled 70S ribosome method, pelleted through a 32% sucrose cushion in enrichment buffer as described previously. Ribosomes are washed as described earlier and resuspended in 5 ml of enrichment buffer, to which 200 ml of Ni2þ-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen) is added. Ribosome-resin slurries are incubated for 2 h at 4  C and applied to micro-bio spin columns (Biorad). Unbound material is allowed to flow through by gravity and the resin is washed four times with 1 ml of enrichment buffer. After the final wash, the column is placed into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 1 min at 3000g. Stalled ribosomes are eluted with 250 ml of enrichment buffer containing 200 mM imidazole. The eluate is collected by centrifugation at 3000g for 1 min. An increase in factor binding to the stalled ribosomeenriched fraction versus the tight coupled 70S ribosome starting material suggests a functional involvement of that factor in trans-translation (Fig. 17.6B).

3.6. In vitro RNA degradation assay
There are three 30 to 50 -exoribonucleases in E. coli: RNase R, RNase II, and polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). RNase R is distinguished from RNase II and PNPase by its ability to degrade structured RNAs, such as rRNA and RNAs containing repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences, without the aid of a helicase activity or a protein cofactor (Vincent and Deutscher, 2006). RNase R is also distinguished from other exonucleases by its ability to participate in the tmRNA-facilitated degradation of defective mRNAs (Richards et al., 2006). We routinely use an

PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare). 3.6.2. Preparation of duplex RNA substrate and RNA decay assay For 50 -labeling of the single-stranded ss-32 substrate, we use [g-32P]-ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (New England BioLabs). Briefly, 50 pmol of ss-32 RNA oligo is mixed with 20 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 50 pmol of [g-32P]-ATP in 50 ml reaction volume of 1Â T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer. Radioactive ATP is added last to start the reaction. The reaction mixture is incubated at 37  C for 30 min, followed by denaturation of the kinase at 70  C for 20 min. Unincorporated ATP is removed by applying the kinase reaction mixture to a Sephadex G-25 quick spin column (Roche). Mixing the 50 -32P-labeled ss-32 with the nonradioactive complementary ss-17 in a 1:1.2 molar ratio generates dsRNA-duplex RNase R substrate. The mixture is heated to 95  C for 5 min and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Nonradioactive dsRNA-duplex is generated
therefore, can be captured by affinity chromatography on a Ni2þ -NTA column. The affinity capture of the 6-His^carrying nascent polypeptide also captures the associated stalled ribosomes and the SmpB-tmRNA complex. The unbound flow-through material from the Ni2þ -NTA affinity chromatography step does not contain a significant portion of stalled ribosomes or the SmpB-tmRNA complex.

by mixing both nonradioactive RNA oligos in a 1:1.2 molar ratio, heating to 95  C for 5 min and slowly cooling to room temperature. The typical degradation assay is carried out in 30 ml reaction mixtures containing 3 ml of 10Â RNase R activity buffer, 5 mM nonradioactive dsRNA substrate supplemented with radioactive dsRNA (to make the total radioactivity of each reaction $50,000 cpm), and 0.5 mg of purified RNase R. The volume of each reaction mixture is brought up to 30 ml with Milli-Q water. RNase R is added last to initiate the degradation assay. Analytical samples (5 ml) are taken at desired time points and the reaction is terminated by the addition of equal volume of 2Â gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.025% [v/v] bromophenol blue, and 0.025% [v/v] xylene cyanol). Reaction products are resolved by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide­8 M urea gel and visualized by exposing the dried-gel to a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare). Figure 17.7 shows a typical RNase degradation assay with this substrate.

3.7. In vivo nonstop mRNA (l-cI-N-trpAt) stability and decay assay
We routinely use the rifampicin-chase assay to determine the role of various trans-translation related factors, such as RNase R, in nonstop mRNA decay. We overexpress a nonstop reporter mRNA, block transcription with rifampicin, and measure the half-life of the mRNA in the presence or absence of putative tmRNA-dependent mRNA decay factors. For this assay, cultures of MG1655-rnrÀ and the isogenic wild-type cells harboring pPW500, the l-cI-N nonstop mRNA expression plasmid, are grown to an OD600 of 0.5 to 0.6. Expression of the nonstop reporter transcript is induced by the addition of IPTG for 15 min. At this point, rifampicin is added to a final concentration of 150 mg/ml to inhibit de novo synthesis of RNA. Analytical samples (3 ml) are taken at 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 min after the addition of rifampicin and harvested by centrifugation at 18,000g for 1 min. Whole cell pellets are resuspended in equal volumes of sterile water, and OD600 is measured to enumerate cell numbers. Total E. coli RNA from equal numbers of cells (corresponding to equal OD600) is then extracted. 3.7.1. RNA extraction Place 1.5 ml of bacterial culture in a screw cap tube and harvest the cells by centrifugation at 18,000g for 1 min. Resuspend the cell pellet in 250 ml sterile Milli Q H2O. Add 750 ml Tri-Reagent LS (Molecular Research Center), vortex well. Heat the samples in a heating block at 70  C for 15 min. Add 150 ml of chloroform, vortex well, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.

Figure 17.7 Difference in the ability of RNase R and RNase II to degrade a duplex RNA substrate with a 30 -overhang. RNA degradation reaction mixtures (30 ml), containing a 32P-labeled duplex RNA substrate, were prepared as described in the in vitro RNA degradation assay. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mg of purified RNase R or RNase II, and samples (5 ml) were taken for analysis at 0, 5, 10, and 15 min after enzyme addition. The degradation products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. RNase R is fully capable of degrading the doublestranded region of the substrate to produce 2 to 5 nucleotide degradation products. In contrast, RNase II is unable to degrade the structured portion of the substrate and generates a product of $25 nucleotides, suggesting that it stalls 6 to 8 nucleotides before the secondary structure.

Centrifuge for 15 min at 18,000g at 4  C. Carefully transfer the RNA containing supernatant to a fresh tube, taking care not to transfer any of the Tri-Reagent or interface layer. Add 375 ml of isopropanol to the RNA containing supernatant and vortex well. Incubate at À20  C for 15 to 60 min. Centrifuge for 15 min at 18,000g at 4  C and discard the supernatant.

Add 1 ml of room temperature 75% ethanol to the pellet. Centrifuge for 15 min at 18,000g at 4  C and discard the supernatant. Leave the open tubes in a fume hood for 15 to 30 min to air dry (it is important to not let the pellets overdry). A small white pellet should be visible. If the pellets are not completely dry, the remaining supernatant can be removed with a pipette. Resuspend the pellet in 25 to 50 ml of sterile dH2O. Vortex well and heat at 70  C for 10 min. Vortex again and quantify by A260. The yield of RNA from 1.5 ml of E. coli, at an OD600 of $0.800, is normally between 300 and 1000 ng/ml. 3.7.2. Northern blot analysis Equal amounts of RNA for each sample are resolved by electrophoresis in a denaturing 1.5% (v/v) formaldehyde agarose gel; 15 ml RNA samples are mixed with 10 ml of denaturing solution (6.5 ml formamide, 2 ml formaldehyde, 1.5 ml 10 Â MOPS buffer) and heated at 65  C for 10 min; 5 ml of sample dye is added (2% bromophenol blue, 10 mM EDTA, 50% [v/v] glycerol) to each sample before loading on the gel. RNA is resolved by electrophoresis in a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel. Resolved RNA is transferred to Hybond Nþ membranes (GE Healthcare) by overnight capillary transfer in 20 Â SSC buffer (175.3 g/L sodium chloride, 88.2 g/L sodium citrate). Blots are developed with alkaline phosphatase­conjugated streptavidin and chemiluminescent substrate (Biotin Luminescent Detection Kit, Roche). Membranes are exposed to film and the resulting bands quantified with Image-J software (NIH, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Figure 17.8 shows the experimental analysis of the nonstop reporter mRNA with the previously described assay and detection approach.

3.8. tmRNA-tagged protein stability assay
We routinely use two tmRNA-tagged reporter proteins (l-CI-N-ssrA and GFP-ssrA) as substrates for in vivo and in vitro proteolysis assays by Lon protease. In addition, we use untagged versions of these proteins as controls to demonstrate the specificity of Lon for tmRNA-tagged protein (Choy et al., 2007). We will first describe our in vivo proteolysis assays followed by purification of substrate proteins and our standard in vitro proteolysis assays. 3.8.1. In vivo GFP-ssrA protein stability assay Strains carrying pBAD-GFP or pBAD-GFP-ssrA (a plasmid encoding a GFP protein variant carrying a tmRNA tag at its C-terminus) are cultivated in LB containing 30 mg/ml chloramphenicol at 37  C until the culture

Figure 17.8 In vivo analysis of nonstop mRNA decay with the rifampicin-chase assay. The RNA used in this Northern blot was purified from E. coli MG1655 cells harboring a plasmid encoding a nonstop mRNA under the control of an IPTG inducible promoter. The promoter was induced in logarithmically growing cells with an IPTG at a final concentration of 0.5 mM for15 min. At this point, rifampicin was added to a final concentration of 150 mg/ml and 1.5 ml samples of the culture were taken at 0, 2, 4, 8,16, and 32 min. Equal amounts of RNA from these samples were resolved with electrophoresis in a 1.5% denaturing agarose gel followed by Northern blot analysis. A biotinylated DNA oligonucleotide probe complementary to the nonstop RNAwas used to detect the nonstop mRNA.

OD600 reaches $0.45. Expression of GFP or GFP-ssrA is induced by addition of arabinose to a final concentration of 0.01%. After 1 h of induction, cells are gently harvested and washed once with warmed LB, resuspended in one culture volume of warmed LB containing 30 mg/ml chloramphenicol and 200 mg/ml spectinomycin, and placed back at 37  C. Analytical samples are obtained from the cultures at 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 min time points. Equal numbers of cells from each sample are harvested. Cell pellets are resuspended and lysed in 1 Â SDS sample buffer. Total-cell proteins are resolved by electrophoresis in a 15% TrisTricine gel and analyzed by Western blotting with HRP-conjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP-serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 3.8.2. In vivo l-CI-N protein stability assay E. coli cells carrying the pPW500 plasmid, which harbors the l-CI-N reporter construct under the control of an IPTG inducible promoter (Choy et al., 2007; Keiler et al., 1996), are cultivated in LB containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin at 32  C until culture OD600 reaches $0.45. Expression of l-cI-N-trpAt nonstop mRNA is induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. After a 30 min induction, cells are gently harvested and washed once with warmed LB, resuspended in one culture volume of warmed LB containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin and 200 mg/ml spectinomycin, and placed back at 32  C. Analytical samples are obtained from the cultures at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min time points. Equal numbers of cells from each sample are harvested. Cell pellets are resuspended and lysed in 1 Â SDS sample buffer. Total-cell protein is resolved by electrophoresis in a 15% Tris-Tricine gel and analyzed by Western blotting with

3.8.3. In vitro proteolysis assay In vitro Lon proteolysis assays require purified tmRNA tagged and untagged proteins. The following sections describe the purification of tagged and untagged l-CI-N and GFP proteins and their use in the in vitro proteolysis assay.
3.8.3.1. l-CI-N reporter protein purification The l-CI-N reporter protein (Choy et al., 2007) has internal FLAG and His6 epitopes that are used for protein detection and purification by Ni2þ-NTA chromatography, respectively. tmRNA-tagged and untagged species of l-CI-N protein are simultaneously purified from an E. coli clpP clpX lon triple mutant carrying the pPW500 plasmid. Three liters of E. coli clpX clpP lon/pPW500 cells are grown at 37  C in LB containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin to an OD600 of $0.5. Reporter protein expression is induced with 1 mM IPTG at 37  C for 3 h. The high-level expression of the reporter protein results in production of cotranslationally tmRNA-tagged and untagged version of the protein. Cells are harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM NaPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole), and lysed by sonication. Cell debris is removed by centrifugation at 30,000g for 1 h, and 1 ml of 50% Ni2þNTA agarose resin is added to the supernatant and rotated for 1 h at 4  C. The Ni2þ-NTA bound material is washed extensively with lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. Both forms of l-CI-N protein are eluted with elution buffer (50 mM NaPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole). The absence of contaminating proteins is verified by Tris-Tricine-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. Protein samples are concentrated, exchanged into storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM bME, 10% [v/v] glycerol), aliquoted, flash frozen using liquid nitrogen, and stored at À80  C. 3.8.3.2. GFP and GFP-ssrA purification GFP and GFP-ssrA are purified as described (Choy et al., 2007). GFP is purified from E. coli strain JM109 expressing pBAD-GFP. GFP-ssrA (a GFP protein variant carrying a tmRNA tag at its C-terminus) is purified from E. coli clpP clpX lon triple mutant expressing pBAD-GFP-ssrA. This strain permits the purification of GFP-ssrA with intact tmRNA tag. The absence of contaminating proteins in the final preparation is verified by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. Protein samples are concentrated and stored at À80  C.

3.8.3.3. Proteolysis of tmRNA-tagged proteins In vitro Lon proteolysis assays are performed with a minimal activity buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT). Complete assays contain 1 mM Lon-6His, 10 mM of tmRNA-tagged or untagged substrate, an ATP regeneration system (50 mM creatine phosphate, 80 mg/ml creatine kinase [Roche]), and 4 mM ATP. Complete reaction mixtures are incubated at 37  C, and analytical samples are taken at various time points. The levels of untagged and tmRNA-tagged proteins at selected time points are analyzed by electrophoresis in a 15% Tris-Tricine gel and quantified with a GS-710 imaging densitometer and Quantity One software (BioRad). In addition, the levels of GFP and GFP-ssrA can be easily assessed through fluorescence measurements of analytical samples with a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) that is configured with empirically determined excitation (476 nm) and emission wavelengths and (519 nm).
