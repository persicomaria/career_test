Enzymatic conversion of structural polysaccharides in plant biomass is a key issue in the development of second generation (`lignocellulosic') bioethanol. The efficiency of this process depends in part on the ability of enzymes to disrupt crystalline polysaccharides, thus gaining access to single polymer chains. Recently, new insights into how enzymes accomplish this have been obtained from studies on enzymatic conversion of chitin. First, chitinolytic microorganisms were shown to produce non-hydrolytic accessory proteins that increase enzyme efficiency. Second, it was shown that a processive mechanism, which is generally considered favorable because it improves substrate accessibility, might in fact slow down enzymes. These findings suggest new focal points for the development of enzyme technology for depolymerizing recalcitrant polysaccharide biomass. Improving substrate accessibility should be a key issue because this might reduce the need for using processive enzymes, which are intrinsically slow and abundantly present in current commercial enzyme preparations for biomass conversion. Furthermore, carefully selected substrate-disrupting accessory proteins or domains might provide novel tools to improve substrate accessibility and thus contribute to more efficient enzymatic processes. Introduction Many living organisms use networks of fibrous and crystalline polysaccharides to maintain structural integrity. Enzymatic conversion of the most recalcitrant of these polysaccharides is of great biological and economic importance and affects processes varying from the interplay between, for example, plants or insects and their pathogens to the production of second generation (`lignocellulosic') bioethanol. In plants, the major structural polysaccharide is cellulose [b(1->4)linked glucose], whereas non-plants such as insects, crustaceans and fungi employ chitin [b(1>4)linked N-acetylglucosamine], which occurs in two major forms, a-chitin and b-chitin (Box 1). In nature, degradation of cellulosic or chitinous biomass is achieved by mixtures of hydrolytic exo- and endo-acting enzymes that act in a synergistic manner [1,2]. There is currently great interest in these enzymatic machineries because they have the potential to convert lignocellulosic biomass to fermentable sugars; however, costs for such enzymes are currently a

major limiting factor for the commercial development of lignocellulosic bioethanol [1,3­5]. Enzymes acting on crystalline polysaccharides face several challenges. They need to be able to associate with the insoluble substrate, disrupt the polymer packing and, importantly, guide a single polymer chain into the catalytic center (Figures 1 and 2). As early as 1950, Reese and coworkers suggested that hydrolysis of cellulose would require an (unknown) non-hydrolytic component that was able to disrupt polymer packing in the substrate, thereby increasing its accessibility for the hydrolytic enzyme [6]. However, even today there is no clear-cut experimental evidence for the existence of such a component in cellulolytic enzyme systems. Alternatively, productive interactions with the substrate might also be promoted by an intrinsic property of the enzymes themselves, namely the ability to employ a processive (`multiple attack') mechanism [7]. Processive cellulases or chitinases have been shown to have long and deep active site clefts, or even tunnels (Figure 1) [8]. Single polymer chains are threaded through these clefts or tunnels while disaccharides are being cleaved off at the catalytic center (Box 2, Figures 1 and 2). This mechanism is considered to be beneficial for enzyme efficiency because the enzyme remains closely associated with the detached single polymer chain in between hydrolytic steps. Furthermore, the detached chain is prevented from re-associating with the crystalline material, which would make it less accessible. Recent studies on the enzymatic conversion of chitin have provided important new insights into both mechanisms that would allow improved substrate accessibility. First, chitin-degrading organisms were found to produce a non-hydrolytic accessory protein, showing for the first time that accessory proteins such as those hypothesized by Reese et al. [6] do indeed exist, at least in chitinolytic machineries. Second, the unique experimental possibilities offered by using the soluble polymeric chitin-derivative chitosan (Box 1) provided new insights in the benefits and, importantly, disadvantages of processivity for enzyme efficiency. Here, we discuss these recent findings and argue that they point toward new directions for the future development of enzymes for biomass conversion. Accessory proteins In 2005, Vaaje-Kolstad et al. [9,10] showed that CBP21, a non-hydrolytic 19 kDa chitin-binding protein [11] produced

Box 1. Cellulose and chitin
Cellulose and chitin are the most abundant biopolymers in the terrestrial and marine environments, respectively. Cellulose is a linear b-(1­4)-linked polymer of D-gluco-pyranose units in the 4C1 conformation (Figure Ia) and chitin is a cellulose derivative where the 2-hydroxy group has been substituted with an acetamido group (Figure Ib ). Different polymorphic forms of cellulose have been described where the glucan chains are believed to be packed in a parallel fashion in cellulose I (i.e. with the reducing ends pointing in the same direction) and in anti-parallel fashion in cellulose II. It is still not understood how it is possible to convert parallel cellulose chains into an anti-parallel packing in processes that are essentially solid-state transformations. Interestingly, chitin also exists in two main crystalline forms, where a-chitin is similar to cellulose II and bchitin has a parallel chain arrangement comparable to that of cellulose I. From crystal structure data for cellulose and chitin and the unit cell dimensions it is possible to calculate packing densities, which are estimated at 1.62 g/cm3 for cellulose and a significantly lower 1.46 g/cm3 for chitin. Little is known about the effect of this difference on the enzymatic degradation of insoluble cellulose or chitin. Other substrate parameters, such as the degree of crystallinity and the degree of heterogeneity of the samples, might be equally important. The insolubility of cellulose and chitin in water is a major obstacle for in-depth studies of enzymatic degradation, especially when complex issues such as enzyme processivity are addressed (see Box 2). Therefore, several chemically modified soluble cellulose and chitin forms have been developed. Soluble cellulose derivatives are obtained by modification of free hydroxyl groups. The most commonly used soluble cellulose form in research is carboxymethylcellulose, in which on average $0.5­0.9 hydroxyl groups per sugar (primarily O-2) have been modified. These relatively large extra groups pose steric limitations to the enzyme­substrate interaction that in turn might affect processivity. Chitosans, a family of well-characterized water-soluble chitin derivatives [35], are derived from chitins by removing varying fractions of the N-acetyl groups, which results in less bulky amino groups on the polymer. These polymers are very valuable substrates for in-depth studies of processivity in family 18 chitinases (see Box 2) [2,36,44,45].

by one of the most efficient bacterial chitin-degraders, Serratia marcescens, strongly increased the efficiency of chitinases in degrading certain forms of crystalline chitin (Figure 2). This was the first clear example of an accessory protein produced to improve the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis of an insoluble recalcitrant polysaccharide substrate. Interestingly, CBP21-like proteins can be found in

many chitinolytic microorganisms, as well as in insect viruses that need to perforate the chitinous heteropolymeric peritrophic matrix of the insect gut before infection. It could be shown that insect virus infectivity was dramatically increased when insect larvae were fed a CBP21-like protein ([12] and references therein). The functionality of CBP21 was tested in combination with several individual pure chitinases [10]. The magnitude of the synergistic effect of CBP21 depended on the enzyme used because different enzymes exhibit different intrinsic abilities to degrade the substrate. CBP21 binds only to b-chitin, and hence can only contribute to the degradation of his substrate. There are CBP21-like proteins that are known to bind a-chitin, but their potential effect on chitin degradation has not yet been explored [13]. Clues to the molecular function of CBP21 come from its crystal structure and site-directed mutagenesis studies [9,10], which showed that the binding surface of CBP21 contains conserved polar residues that are crucial for its synergistic effect (Figure 2c). Interestingly, single point mutations that abolished the synergistic effect of the protein had only moderate effects on the chitin binding affinity [10]. This demonstrates that the action of CBP21-like proteins is driven by other factors in addition to mere binding activity. An interesting possibility is that the assembly of polar amino acid side chains on the binding surface is needed to form a specific set of multiple hydrogen bonds with the substrate, thus disrupting the hydrogen-binding network between individual polymer chains. This could also explain why CBP-like proteins only bind to certain types of substrates, which have specific packing arrangements and hydrogen-bonding networks (Box 1). The example of CBP21 clearly shows that in nature accessory proteins have evolved to improve substrate accessibility and to act synergistically with hydrolytic enzymes. So far, a corresponding example is lacking from cellulase research, but there are a few indications that proteins exist that are capable of disrupting cellulose and cellulose-containing heteropolymeric complexes. For example, plants produce proteins, so-called expansins, which contribute to a loosening of the cell wall necessary for plant growth [14]. Expansins have also been detected in nematodes that are able to degrade plant cell walls [15]. It is known that expansins mechanically weaken plant cell walls and pure cellulose paper [16], and the use of expansins to improve cellulase efficiency has been suggested [17]. However, application of expansins has been hampered by the fact that these proteins are difficult to produce in vitro [17,18]. Interestingly, two very recent studies showed that expansin-like grass pollen allergens, which are easy to obtain [18], and a non-characterized protein from corn stover [19] could be used to increase cellulase efficiency. Another potential CBP21 analogue that could act on cellulose is swollenin from the cellulose-degrading fungus Trichoderma reesei. Swollenin contains both a cellulosebinding domain and an expansin-like domain [20] and, furthermore, its expression is co-regulated with cellulase expression [21]. Swollenin showed clear disruptive effects on cellulose, but its application as an accessory protein to

cellulases has so far not been described. Available information for fungal genomes suggests that expansin-like domains occur regularly in fungal proteins that act on plant polysaccharides, suggesting that these domains are indeed used for substrate disruption, either as functional parts of swollenin-like proteins or as accessory domains in cellulases and related enzymes. Based on sequence comparisons, carbohydrate-binding domains and proteins have been classified in $50 different families of carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) [22,23]. CBP21 belongs to CBM family 33. Most CBMs do not exist as free proteins but rather as substrate-binding domains in multi-domain hydrolytic enzymes, such as chitinases and cellulases (Figures 1 and 2). The roles of these domains in cellulases and chitinases have received much attention, and it is well established that they contribute to enzyme efficiency by increasing affinity for the substrate [23­28]. Importantly, it has been shown that some cellulose-binding domains can change the structure of the crystalline substrate [29­34] and that this `destructuring' effect alone might have a positive effect on cellulase efficiency [29­32]. Thus, cellulose-binding domains in cellulases might have similar effects on cellulolytic activity as CBP21-like proteins have on chitinolytic activity.

Processivity Once a hydrolytic enzyme is bound to an individual polymer chain, it seems beneficial for it to act processively, that is, the enzyme remains associated with the chain in between hydrolytic steps, thus preventing its substrate from re-associating with the insoluble material (Figure 2a). However, it is not well established how processivity contributes to overall enzyme efficiency. Processivity cannot be easily measured because the insoluble substrate is not amenable to straightforward biochemical analysis. Moreover, methods that are able to determine processivity have limitations (Box 2). In the case of chitin, it is possible to study processivity using soluble chitin variants, so-called chitosans [35], which resemble chitin and therefore are able to interact with chitinases in a natural manner (see Boxes 1 and 2). Using chitosans, we could recently show that the processivity of the chitobiohydrolase chitinase B (ChiB) from Serratia marcescens was almost completely abolished by one single point mutation of an aromatic residue close to the catalytic center (Figure 1c, Figure 3) [36]. As expected, this non-processive mutant was less effective in degrading insoluble chitin. However, the degradation rates for soluble and thus more accessible substrates, such as a

The substrate shown is b-chitin, in which the reducing ends of the parallel polysaccharides point to the right. For clarity, the sugars are oversized compared to the enzymes. The chitinase consists of a catalytic (blue) and an accessory chitin-binding (gray) domain. Accessibility of the substrate is low, resulting in a low extend of chitin degradation. (b) Chitin degradation in the presence of CBP21 (red). CBP interferes with chitin crystal packing, thus increasing substrate accessibility and enzyme efficiency and hence chitin degradation. These two panels also illustrate enzyme processivity, that is, the enzyme tends to remain associated with the polymer chain while cleaving off disaccharides. (c) Surface representation of CBP21. The side chains of conserved residues in the (rather flat) binding surface are colored yellow [9]. (d) The effect of CBP21 on chitinase efficiency is illustrated (adapted from [10]). In the presence of CBP21, complete conversion of the substrate is achieved $6 times faster than in the absence of CBP21.

chitin hexamer oligosaccharide and polymeric chitosan, were increased by fourfold and, spectacularly, 29-fold, respectively. This demonstrates that the beneficial effect of processivity on substrate accessibility, in the case of activity towards chitin, comes at a cost of enzyme speed when more accessible substrates such as chitosan are used. In other words, the `stickyness' that keeps processive enzymes tightly associated with their substrate in between consecutive hydrolytic steps is unfavorable for soluble substrates whose efficient degradation does not depend on keeping the single polymer chains detached from the crystalline matrix. From a technological point of view, this leads to the important conclusion that processive enzymes can and should be avoided if the crystalline structure of the substrate could be pre-disrupted by other means so that substrate accessibility is no longer the rate-limiting step.

The substrate-binding grooves of processive cellulases and chitinases are lined with aromatic residues, suggesting that these enzymes employ similar strategies for substrate-binding and processivity (Figure 1). Detailed crystallographic studies of cellulase enzyme­substrate complexes support the hypothesis that these aromatic residues play important roles in the enzyme­substrate association during the processive action [37]. It has been shown in a few cases that mutation of aromatic residues in the substrate-binding clefts of cellulases led to reduced processivity [38­41]. The observed effects were generally less drastic than those reported for chitinases, but this could also reflect technical limitations in measuring processivity (Box 2). Most importantly, a careful re-evaluation of the available cellulase literature [39­41] confirms a negative correlation between processivity and enzyme effi231

Box 2. Processivity and how it can be measured
Figure I shows initial endo-binding of a chitin polymer to a processive glycoside hydrolase, which contains six subsites numbered À3 to +3 and an additional carbohydrate-binding domain (`CBM') (pictured is the arrangement in S. marcescens ChiB [46]). The reducing end sugar is colored gray and the direction of processivity is indicated by an arrow. A correctly positioned N-acetyl group (symbolized by small black balls on sticks) in the ­1 subsite is essential for catalysis to occur (catalysis is `substrate-assisted') [47]. Note that consecutive sugars in cellulose or chitin are rotated by 1808 (see Box 1), with the consequence that only every second sugar will have a productive configuration when the polymer is threaded through the active site of an enzyme. In the scheme shown, the first hydrolysis (indicated by (i)) will produce a pentasaccharide, whereas all further cleavages (ii­iv) that result from the same initial enzyme­substrate association will produce disaccharides. The saccharide pentamer will eventually be degraded to a disaccharide and a trisaccharide (some enzymes might convert the trisaccharide to a monosaccharide and a disaccharide). So, although initial cleavages might yield odd-numbered saccharide oligomers that eventually yield trisaccharides, subsequent processive cleavages yield disaccharides only. Thus, the ratio between the amount of disaccharides and the amount of trisaccharides (or monomers) will increase with the processivity of the enzyme. However, it should be noted that this ratio is affected by the way the enzyme binds to and degrades intermediate products. For example, a hexameric intermediate product might be converted to two trimers or to three dimers, depending on processivity-independent binding preferences in the respective subsites. Another method for measuring processivity is a comparison of the amount of soluble and non-soluble reducing ends produced during a reaction. Processive enzymes yield more soluble reducing ends because they cleave many times within one polymer chain (as opposed to cleaving once in several polymer chains; this latter would increase the number of reducing ends in the insoluble fraction). A problem with this method is that non-processive enzymes that preferably bind in an exo-mode (i.e. at chain ends) will yield similar results to processive enzymes. Chitosan presents a unique opportunity to observe processivity in chitinases that belong to the family 18 of glycoside hydrolases [22] because these enzymes have an absolute requirement for an

acetylated sugar in the ­1 subsite in order for substrate binding to be productive [47]. Thus, complexes formed during processive action on chitosan (partially deacetylated chitin) might be non-productive [2,44] because the sugar bound in the ­1 subsite might lack the acetyl group. For processive enzymes, this translates into a product profile that is dominated by longer even-numbered saccharide oligomers during the initial phases of the degradation reaction (see also Figure 3a in main text). When a non-productive complex emerges, the enzyme does not dissociate from the substrate (which would have yielded a more random distribution of odd- and even-numbered products: see Figure 3b,c in main text). Instead, processive `movement' continues until the next productive complex emerges after the enzyme has moved along an additional 2, 4 or 6 (or more) sugars. So, in a processive enzyme, all products resulting from the same initial enzyme­chitosan binding event will be even-numbered, except for the very first product (as explained above). In the case of chitin, all the even-numbered products would be disaccharides. See Ref. [45] for more details.

ciency toward soluble substrates. Recent evidence comes from a study of the processive cellulase Cel9A from Thermobifida fusca (Figure 1d) [41]. Li et al. demonstrated that mutations of aromatic residues close to the catalytic center of Cel9A reduced processivity and activity towards crystalline cellulose, while at the same time improving activity towards (soluble and more accessible) carboxymethyl cellulose [41]. Implications for bioethanol-related enzyme research Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose to fermentable sugars is a rather difficult task and currently requires 40­100 times more enzyme per gallon of ethanol than hydrolysis of corn starch [1]. Consequently, and despite considerable research efforts in the past two decades, the costs of enzymes remain a major factor that limits the profitability of producing cellulose-based bioethanol. Technologies that produce more efficient enzymes will have beneficial effects for the biofuel industry, not only because they lower enzyme cost per gallon of ethanol but also because they might result in faster processing times, which, in turn, reduce capital investment per gallon of production capacity. Major efforts are underway to discover or to engineer novel enzymes with the aim to develop cheaper and more-effective enzyme mixtures that can be applied in the bioethanol industry [1,42].

Although there is currently no direct experimental evidence that would allow us to quantitatively extrapolate the results obtained from chitinase research to cellulases, the significant results from chitinases nevertheless indicate that focusing on the roles of accessory proteins or protein domains and on the role of processivity is a promising approach for the future development of cellulolytic enzyme systems. For example, as shown in Figure 2d, full conversion of a chitin substrate was obtained about six times faster when the accessory protein CBP21 was added (see [10] for more examples). The non-processive variant of ChiB acted almost 30 times faster than the processive wildtype on soluble polymeric substrate, which is a considerable rate enhancement. Similar effects have not yet been described for cellulolytic enzyme machineries but might be validated once the roles of potential accessory proteins or domains and of processivity on their function have been elucidated in more detail. Several common commercial enzyme preparations for conversion of cellulose, such as CelluclastTM from Novozymes, contain a mix of cellulases produced by the fungus Trichoderma reesei, and the overall enzyme activity is dominated by the processive cellobiohydrolases CBHI (Cel7A) and CBHII (Cel6A). It is well established that these enzymes are crucial for the efficiency of the enzyme preparations towards cellulose [1,7]. Clearly, as explained

Shown are size exclusion chromatograms obtained for the degradation products after $14% of the glycosidic bonds in the highly polymeric substrate had been cleaved. Oligosaccharides are labeled according to the number of sugar monomers (note that products containing five or less monomers might show multiple peaks because species with different sequences are partly resolved). (a) Wild-type ChiB acts processively on chitosan. As explained in detail in Box 2, this results in the retention of a large polymer peak and a degradation product profile that is dominated by even-numbered products. (b) The W97A mutant variant of ChiB has lost most of its processivity with the consequence that no polymer peak remained. The product profile covered all possible fragment lengths, with a diminished dominance of longer even-numbered products (e.g. hexamers and octamers). In addition, degradation of chitosan was almost 30 times faster than observed with the wild-type enzyme [36]. (c) For comparsion, the degradation profile of ChiC, a natural non-processive endo-acting chitinase from Serratia marcescens, is shown. In the W97A mutant, the processive endo-acting wild-type ChiB (a) [45] becomes less processive which results in a product profile (b) that looks more like that of a truly non-processive enzyme (c). Abbreviation: wt, wild-type. Panels (a) and (b) adapted from Ref. [36].

above, the processive character of the enzymes is beneficial for interacting with insoluble substrates. However, the results obtained from chitinases show that the processive enzyme character might also explain why enzymatic cellulose conversion, despite years of research, is still a slow process. Other, non-processive cellulases might prove to be more efficient if they are offered a sufficiently disrupted (i.e. accessible) substrate or if they can act in concert with an optimized substrate-disrupting accessory protein or domain. The remarkable results obtained with CBP21 could stimulate the technological exploration of the promising expansins and swollenin-like proteins, as well as further studies that are aimed at optimizing the contribution of cellulose-binding domains with disruptive effects. Such accessory proteins or domains are expected to generally accelerate hydrolysis reactions and might, in addition, reduce the need to use processive (and hence slow) enzymes. Useful accessory proteins could be added to cellulase mixtures or the microorganisms producing these mixtures could be genetically modified to also produce these proteins. Both strategies would lead to the generation of novel enzyme mixtures that combine optimal catalytic and accessory domains. Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass requires a chemical and/or physical pre-treatment step to disrupt plant fiber structure and to increase substrate accessibility

[3,5]. For example, cellulases will release hardly any soluble sugar from a wood chip substrate, whereas the majority of its cellulose can be solubilized if the polymer packing in the wood structure is first disrupted by harsh techniques such as steam explosion [43]. The type of pre-treatment, its outcome and the choice of subsequent enzyme treatments are interconnected and depend on the type of biomass used. It is important to take all these aspects into account when testing technological applications of potential accessory proteins or domains. CBP21-like proteins are specific for certain types of chitin, and cellulose-binding domains are specific for certain types and structures of cellulose crystals [23,26,27]. An additional factor that further complicates hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is its heterogeneous polysaccharide composition, consisting of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin co-polymers. Naturally occurring accessory proteins or domains might have evolved to act on such complex heteropolymers. Taking these factors into account, it is to be expected that accessory proteins or domains that work well towards a relatively homogeneous polymeric substrate under laboratory conditions might not work on natural heteropolymeric substrates or pretreated biomass, or vice versa. Conclusion Although it remains to be seen to what extent the recent findings of the roles of processivity and accessory proteins
233

Opinion
in chitin degradation can be extrapolated to cellulolytic enzymes, it is undisputable that they signal an important direction for future research on enzymes for biofuels. The roles of cellulose-binding domains, which have already been partly unraveled, need to be explored further, and efforts to technologically exploit these domains must be increased. A more intense search for accessory proteins in the genomes of cellulose-degrading or -modifying organisms might yield new useful proteins that could be produced on a large scale, such as the expansin-like proteins [18]. It is possible that potentially important, hitherto unknown accessory proteins might be discovered by critical (re-)evaluation of gene expression data, which are available for, for example, Trichoderma reesei [21]. Finally, the remarkable properties of the non-processive mutant of ChiB show that the role of processivity in cellulose degradation needs more attention. The question remains whether there are other ways to obtain the benefits of processivity, for example by using pre-treatment steps and/or CBP21-like accessory proteins. The data available for chitinases clearly demonstrate that a better combined understanding of these issues is important for the further improvement of enzyme technology for biomass conversion, which will subsequently stimulate commercial production of lignocellulosic ethanol.
