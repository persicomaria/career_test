SUMMARY

The CHK2 protein kinase is an important transducer of DNA damage checkpoint signals, and its mutation contributes to hereditary and sporadic cancer. CHK2 activation is triggered by the phosphorylation of Thr68 by the DNA damage-activated ATM kinase. This leads to transient CHK2 dimerization, in part through intermolecular phosphoThr68-FHA domain interactions. Dimerization promotes kinase activation through activation-loop autophosphorylation, but the mechanism of this process has not been clear. The dimeric crystal structure of CHK2, described here, in conjunction with biochemical and mutational data reveals that productive CHK2 dimerization additionally involves intermolecular FHAkinase domain and FHA-FHA interactions. Ile157, mutated in the Li-Fraumeni cancer-predisposition syndrome, plays a central role in the FHA-kinase domain interface, explaining the lack of dimerization and autophosphorylation of this mutant. In the dimer, the kinase active sites face each other in close proximity, indicating that dimerization may also serve to optimally position the kinase active sites for efficient activation loop transphosphorylation.
INTRODUCTION The DNA damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoints play a central role in maintaining genomic integrity, and checkpoint defects can result in genomic instability and cancer predisposition (Harper and Elledge, 2007; Hoeijmakers, 2001; Khanna and Jackson, 2001). These checkpoints detect a variety of DNA lesions resulting from environmental or endogenous genotoxic agents or from collapsed replication forks. In response, they initiate a cascade of protein phosphorylation events that result in the arrest or delay of cell-cycle progression, in the activation and coordination of DNA repair, in the induction of checkpointassociated transcription programs, and in certain contexts in apoptosis (Harper and Elledge, 2007). The checkpoint kinase CHK2 is a central effector of the cell's response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and related

lesions (Ahn et al., 2004; Bartek and Lukas, 2003; Stracker et al., 2009). These lesions activate the phosphatidylinositol kinase family protein kinase (PIKK) ATM (Harper and Elledge, 2007; Lee and Paull, 2005; McGowan and Russell, 2004). ATM can phosphorylate certain downstream proteins directly, but it also phosphorylates and activates CHK2 (Ahn et al., 2004; Falck et al., 2001; Matsuoka et al., 2000). Activated CHK2 dissociates from sites of damage, and it acts as a diffusible signal transducer in phosphorylating downstream targets (Lukas et al., 2003). The substrates of CHK2 include checkpoint proteins such as BRCA1 and, in certain contexts, p53, the cell-cycle transcription factor E2F1, and the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) involved in apoptosis (Ahn et al., 2003; Hirao et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2000; Stevens et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2002). CHK2 may also contribute to the phosphorylation of the CDC25 phosphatases, which promote cell-cycle progression by dephosphorylating and activating cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (Bartek and Lukas, 2003; Falck et al., 2001; Matsuoka et al., 1998). Consistent with its critical roles in the DNA damage checkpoint, CHK2 mutations have been linked to a wide range of cancers (Antoni et al., 2007; Bartek and Lukas, 2003). Heterozygous CHK2 germline mutations have been identified in patients with the Li-Fraumeni cancer-predisposition syndrome and in patients with familial breast cancer (Bell et al., 1999; MeijersHeijboer et al., 2002; Oldenburg et al., 2003; Vahteristo et al., 2002). In addition, CHK2 alterations have been found in cell lines from a variety of cancers, including myelodysplastic syndromes, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and osteosarcomas (Aktas et al., 2002; Dong et al., 2003; Matsuoka et al., 2001; Miller et al., 2002). It is now thought that CHK2 is a low-penetrance, multiorgan cancer susceptibility gene (Antoni et al., 2007). Human CHK2, also known as hCDS1, is a 543 amino acid protein that consists of an N-terminal SQ/TQ cluster domain (SCD), a central forkhead-associated (FHA) domain, and a C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain (KD) (Ahn et al., 2004). The SCD consists of multiple SQ/TQ (Ser-Gln/Thr-Gln) motifs that are characteristic of ATM phosphorylation sites, with Thr68 being the primary site that gets phosphorylated in response to DNA damage (Ahn et al., 2000; Matsuoka et al., 2000; Melchionna et al., 2000). The FHA domain is a proteinprotein interaction domain that binds to phospho threonine-containing peptides, including the phosphoThr68 segment of the SCD (Ahn et al., 2002; Li et al., 2002). The CHK2 kinase domain is inactive in the absence of DNA damage. Like most other Ser/ Thr protein kinases, the activation of the CHK2 KD requires

phosphorylation of Thr383 on the activation loop (Lee and Chung, 2001; Schwarz et al., 2003). Inactive CHK2 exists as a monomer in unperturbed cells. DNA damage-induced SCD phosphorylation results in CHK2 dimerization, followed by the activation of the kinase domain through activation loop autophosphorylation, most likely in trans (Ahn and Prives, 2002; Ahn et al., 2002; Lee and Chung, 2001; Schwarz et al., 2003). Dimerization requires the interaction of the phosphorylated Thr68-containing SCD segment of one CHK2 molecule with the FHA domain of a second molecule, as mutation of Thr68 or of the FHA residues involved in phosphothreonine binding impairs CHK2 dimerization and activation (Ahn et al., 2002; Melchionna et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2002). The CHK2 FHA domain binds to the Thr68-phosphorylated SCD segment only weakly, with a reported dissociation constant (Kd) of $30 mM (Li et al., 2002), but the reciprocal nature of two phosphoThr68-FHA interactions has been suggested to stabilize the dimer beyond the apparent Kd of the isolated FHA-phosphoThr68 peptide complex (Li et al., 2008). Several lines of evidence indicate that the CHK2 dimer is a transient intermediate in the activation process and that, once activated, the dimer dissociates into monomers. Differentially tagged CHK2 mutants coimmunoprecipitate after DNA damage only if their kinase domain is inactivated by mutation (Ahn et al., 2002). In addition, once CHK2 is activated, Thr 68 phosphorylation is no longer required for maintaining kinase activity (Ahn and Prives, 2002). Although transient, CHK2 dimerization is necessary for the activation process, as the Li-Fraumeni I157T mutation in the FHA domain impairs dimerization and autophosphorylation, while not affecting the binding to phospho-threonine peptides (Schwarz et al., 2003). These properties of the I157T mutant further suggest that CHK2 activation may involve a mechanism beyond the simple association of the phosphorylated SCD with the FHA domain. The crystal structures of the isolated CHK2 FHA and kinase domains have been reported, but how they cooperate to bring about the regulated activation of CHK2 has not been clear (Li et al., 2002; Oliver et al., 2006). To address this question, we have determined the crystal structure of a kinase-inactive CHK2 mutant consisting of the FHA and kinase domains. Even though it is lacking the SCD, the protein crystallizes as a dimer in two independent crystal forms, and we provide biochemical and mutational evidence that this is the dimeric intermediate in the activation pathway. The dimer forms through reciprocal FHA-KD and FHA-FHA interactions between the two monomers. The FHA-KD interactions are centered on Ile157, a residue mutated in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome, explaining the lack of dimerization and activation of the I157T CHK2 mutant. In the dimer, the kinase active sites face each other in close proximity and in an arrangement that would facilitate the trans-phosphorylation of their activation loops, suggesting that dimerization optimally arranges the two kinase active sites for activation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Crystallization and Structure Determination In keeping with previous reports, we found that E. coli-expressed full-length CHK2 is activated by autophosphorylation and is

monomeric (Ahn and Prives, 2002; Lee and Chung, 2001; Schwarz et al., 2003). Also as reported, this recombinant CHK2 displayed heterogeneous phosphorylation of at least eight sites (King et al., 2006) (data not shown). Autoactivation, dissociation into monomers, and heterogeneous phosphorylation also occurred with truncated CHK2 lacking the SCD, but not with the isolated kinase domain lacking both the SCD and FHA domains (data not shown). Thus, in order to investigate the mechanism of dimerization and to avoid heterogeneous phosphorylation, we used a CHK2 mutant harboring the K249R mutation (CHK2K249R) in the kinase active site. Similar kinase-dead CHK2 mutants have been shown to remain in an oligomeric form following Thr68 phosphorylation by ATM (Ahn et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2002). Limited proteolysis of full-length CHK2K249R indicated that the $70 N-terminal residues containing the SCD and the $30 C-terminal residues are highly susceptible to digestion, suggesting that they are unstructured or loosely folded (data not shown). With the exception of the S/TQ clusters within the SCD, these protease-sensitive regions also show the lowest evolutionary conservation (Figure S1 available online). Crystallization trials of a series of truncated CHK2K249R mutants containing the FHA and kinase domains yielded two crystal forms. CHK2K249R consisting of residues 70­512 crystallized in space group P1, and a slightly shorter CHK2K249R consisting of residues 84­502 crystallized in space group P212121 (Figure 1A). We determined the structure of the P212121 crystal form by a combination of multiwavelength anomalous dispersion ° (MAD) and molecular replacement and refined it to 3.0 A resolution (Table 1). The asymmetric unit of the P212121 form contains two CHK2 molecules that are arranged in a 2-fold symmetric dimer. We determined the structure of the P1 crystal form by molecular replacement, using the P212121 structure as the ° search model, and refined it to 3.25 A resolution (Table 1). The P1 asymmetric unit contains eight CHK2 molecules that are arranged as four dimers, each very similar to the dimer in the P212121 crystal form. In both crystal forms, the refined models encompass residues 92­501, which include the N-terminal FHA domain (residues 92­205), the C-terminal kinase domain (residues 213­501), and a six-residue intervening linker (residues 206­212) (Figure S1). Overall Structure of the CHK2 Dimer CHK2 forms an intertwined, domain-exchanged dimer (Figures 1B and 1C). The two FHA domains interact with each other across the dyad axis. Thereafter, the polypeptide chain of the FHA-KD linker crosses over the dyad axis, leading to the kinase domain of one CHK2 protomer interacting with the FHA domain of the other CHK2 protomer. Reciprocal FHA-kinase domain interactions then give rise to a mostly symmetric dimer. The individual structures of the ten CHK2 protomers in the two crystal forms and their quaternary dimeric structures are overall very similar. The dimer of the P212121 crystal form superimposes on one of the four dimers of the P1 crystal form with ° a 1.1 A root mean square deviation (rmsd) in the positions of 750 out of 766 Ca atoms. Other pairwise superpositions of the ° ° five dimers give rmsd values ranging from 1.1 A to 1.7 A (Figure S2).

residues 306­501), with the ATP-binding site located at the cleft between the two lobes (Figure 1B). The unphosphorylated CHK2 kinase domain adopts the canonical inactive structure characterized by a more open relative orientation of the N and C lobes and by conformational changes in regulatory N lobe (aC helix, residues 269­280) and the C lobe elements (activation loop, residues 371­ 391). As reported previously, the structure of the CHK2 FHA domain (residues 92­205) consists of an eleven-stranded b sandwich, with an opening at one end of the b sandwich forming the phospho-threonine-binding site (Li et al., 2002). The other end of the b sheet has an extended hairpin (b50 ­b60 ) that contains Ile157, the residue mutated in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (Bell et al., 1999). This end of the b sheet and the b50 ­b60 hairpin interact intermolecularly with the kinase N lobe of the other CHK2 protomer. The b50 ­ b60 hairpin is the only part of our FHA structure that deviates significantly from the structure of the isolated CHK2 FHA domain. The two phospho-threonine-binding sites are located distal to the dimerization interfaces and are fully accessible for the binding of their ligands (Figures 1B and 1C). The FHA and kinase domains are connected by a sevenresidue, well-ordered linker (residues 206­212) (Figure S3A). The linker has a mostly extended conformation interrupted by a short a helix (residues 208­211). The FHA-kinase linker interacts with the N lobe of its own kinase and with the FHA domains of both protomers. ° The CHK2 dimer buries a total surface area of 4642 A2 relative to the hypothetical CHK2 monomer of the same structure. Approximately half of this surface area is buried by the two inter° faces ($980 A2 each) between the FHA domains and the kinase ° N lobes, 760 A2 by the FHA-FHA interface and the rest by the intermolecular interactions between the kinase domains and the linkers.

The CHK2 kinase domain has the canonical Ser/Thr kinase fold, consisting of an N-terminal lobe rich in b sheet (N lobe; residues 213­305) and a larger, mostly a-helical C-terminal lobe (C lobe;

FHA-Kinase Dimerization Interface The FHA-KD interface is formed through the packing of one end of the FHA b sandwich (b50 , b60 , b90 ) that includes the long b50 ­b60 hairpin with a three-stranded concave portion of the kinase N lobe (b1­b3). Central to this interface are van der Waals contacts between hydrophobic patches on the FHA (Gly151, Pro152, Ile157, Tyr159, and Pro182) and KD N lobe (Ile221, Phe238, Leu226, Leu236, Cys243, and the aliphatic portions of Lys224 and Lys245) (Figures 2A and S3B). Several groups at the periphery of the hydrophobic center are within hydrogenbonding distance: the FHA Arg180 backbone carbonyl and KD Cys243 side-chain groups, the FHA Tyr156 backbone carbonyl and KD Lys224 side-chain groups, and the FHA Tyr159 and KD Lys245 side-chain groups (Figure 2A). Ile157 is buried at the center of the hydrophobic interface, making van der Waals contacts to Phe238, Leu236, and Lys224 of the KD N lobe (Figure 2A). Its mutation to Thr would eliminate most of these favorable van der Waals contacts, and it would additionally introduce a polar hydroxyl in an otherwise hydrophobic environment, destabilizing the FHA-KD interface. This explains the lack of dimerization of the I157T Li-Fraumeni mutant (Schwarz et al., 2003) and further supports a role for this dimer interface in CHK2 activation.

Several other cancer-associated mutations in the FHA domain also map to the FHA-KD interface (Bartek and Lukas, 2003). The Pro152Ser mutation maps to the b50 ­b60 hairpin, adjacent to Ile157 at the hydrophobic core of the interface. The structure suggests that this mutation could destabilize the dimer by reducing intermolecular van der Waals contacts and also by affecting the conformation of the b50 ­b60 hairpin. The Arg180Cys/His and Arg181Cys/His FHA mutations map to the periphery of this interface, and neither side chain is involved in substantial intermolecular contacts. However, both side chains are involved in intramolecular contacts, and their mutation may affect the structure or stability of FHA elements at the FHA-KD interface (Figure 2A). FHA-FHA Dimerization Interface The FHA-FHA interface is formed by one face of the FHA b sandwich packing with the corresponding region of the dyad-related FHA, at an $65 angle. Side chains from three adjacent b strands (b10 , b20 , and b110 ) interdigitate and make van der Waals and hydrogen bond contacts (Figures 2B and S3C). The interface is centered on the aromatic side chains of Trp97 and Phe202, which pack with the equivalent residues from the second protomer across the dyad axis. Additional reciprocal interactions include van der Waals contacts from the side chains of Leu99,

Val200, and Leu204 of one protomer to the side chains of Val200, Leu99, and Asn186, respectively, of the other protomer. There is also a set of reciprocal intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the Arg95 and Asn186 side chains. The contribution of FHA-FHA interactions to dimerization is consistent with a recent biochemical study of a Thr68-phosphorylated SCDFHA polypeptide, constructed by phosphopeptide ligation, which suggested weak FHA-FHA interactions even in the absence of SCD phosphorylation (Li et al., 2008). The seven-residue linker that connects the FHA domain to the kinase domain packs through both inter- and intramolecular contacts (Figure 2B). The intermolecular contacts are made to the FHA domain of the other CHK2 protomer, and they involve primarily polar groups within hydrogen-bonding distance (the linker Asp207 side chain, the FHA Asn184 side chain and Asn185 backbone amide groups, and the linker Gln209 and FHA Asn184 side chains) (Figure 2B). The intramolecular contacts are made to the N lobe of the kinase domain and within the linker, and they serve to further stabilize the linker structure through van der Waals contacts (Tyr212, Met212, and Leu216) and hydrogen bond interactions (Gln209, Asp208, and Ser210 side chain and Met222 backbone groups). The two FHA-KD linkers have well-defined and continuous electron density that makes the connection of each linker to

CHK2 Structure

et al., 2002). The structure of the phosphoThr68-containing SCD bound to the CHK2 FHA domain is not known, but the structure of the FHA bound to an 8 amino acid high-affinity peptide has been reported (Li et al., 2002). Based on that structure, the C terminus of the FHA-bound SCD (Tyr 72) would be ° $34 A away from the N terminus (Thr89) of the other FHA, with a clear line of sight (Figure 3). This distance can be readily spanned by the 17 intervening residues, and, in fact, it can be spanned by as few as 9 residues in a fully extended conformation. By contrast, if the SCD-FHA interaction were to be intramolecular, the C terminus of the SCD and the N terminus of its FHA domain would be on opposite sides of the FHA b sandwich, without a clear line of sight. Modeling suggests that a polypeptide ° would have to span $53 A to connect the two ends (Figure 3). Although the 17 intervening residues of human CHK2 could, in principle, span this distance, most other mammalian orthologs have only 12 intervening residues, and these would not be ° sufficient to span the $53 A distance (Figure S1). The structure thus indicates that the SCD-FHA association is intermolecular and that it represents a second exchange of domains within the dimer. Dimerization of CHK2 in Solution To test whether the CHK2 dimer observed in the crystals forms in solution, we analyzed the truncated, kinase-dead CHK2K249R mutant of the P1 crystal form (residues 70­512) by size-exclusion chromatography. As shown in Figure 4A, this protein elutes as two peaks with retention volumes corresponding to 96.4 and 63.7 kDa, in general agreement with the actual 102.2 and 51.1 kDa molecular weights of the dimer and monomer, respectively. The fraction of the dimer peak increases with increasing protein concentration (120 mM to 710 mM), consistent with a monomer-dimer equilibrium (Figures 4A and 4B). In addition, each of the two peaks reproduces the monomer-dimer elution profile and its concentration dependency when reapplied onto the same column following reconcentration (data not shown). As a complementary method of observing the two species, we analyzed increasing concentrations of CHK2 by native gel electrophoresis. As shown in Figure 4C, a second CHK2 species appears as a faster-migrating band starting at a CHK2 concentration of 50 mM. The fraction of this species increases with increasing concentration, again consistent with a monomerdimer equilibrium. Taken together, these data indicate that CHK2 can form dimers in solution in the absence of Thr68 phosphorylation. Although the SCD-independent dimerization is weak, its low affinity is consistent with dimerization being regulated by Thr68 phosphorylation. The weak SCD-independent dimerization observed here, together with the low-affinity pT68-FHA domain association and its reciprocal nature, could, in principle, provide a dimerization avidity adequate to account for the CHK2 dimers observed in vivo. We cannot measure the dimerization constant of Thr68phosphorylated CHK2 because we have not been able to produce adequate amounts of Thr68-phosphorylated kinase-dead CHK2 in vitro. However, as glutamic acid can partially mimic phospho-threonine, we tested the dimerization of a longer,

Molecular surface representation of the CHK2 dimer showing the position of a high-affinity peptide cocrystallized with the isolated FHA domain of CHK2 (Li et al., 2002). The peptides, one for each FHA domain, are positioned by superimposing the FHA domains. Assuming the peptide's phosphoThr is equivalent to Thr68 and the same direction of the polypeptide chain, the peptide would correspond to residues Thr65­Tyr72 of the SCD. Dotted lines ° highlight the 34 A line of sight between the C terminus of the peptide and the N terminus of the FHA domain. Orientation as in Figure 1C.

SCD-containing CHK2K249R (residues 40­502) harboring the Thr68Glu mutation by size-exclusion chromatography. Figures 4D and 4E show that, whereas the SCD-containing CHK2K249R (40­502) has a dimer fraction comparable to that of the shorter CHK2K249R (70­502), the Thr68Glu mutant exhibits a markedly increased dimer fraction. This supports the model that phosphoThr68-FHA interactions can cooperate with SCD-independent interactions to increase the avidity of dimerization. We next used mutagenesis to test whether the dimer that forms in solution corresponds to the one observed in our crystal structures. For this, we mutated two residues that the crystal structure indicates play key roles in dimerization and evaluated the dimerization of the mutant CHK2K249R (40­502) proteins by size-exclusion chromatography. As shown in Figures 4D and 4E, the W97A mutation at the FHA-FHA interface reduced dimerization substantially, whereas the Li-Fraumeni I157T mutation at the FHA-KD interface essentially abolished dimerization even at a concentration of 700 mM. These data indicate that the CHK2 intermolecular interfaces observed in the crystals contribute to SCD-independent dimerization observed in solution as well. Taken together with the published observations that the I157T mutant fails to dimerize and to get autophosphorylated in vivo, our data suggest that the formation of the dimer observed in the crystals is a key step in the activation process. CHK2 Kinase Conformation In both crystal forms, the N lobe aC helix (residues 269­280), which buttresses one side of the ATP-binding cleft and contains a conserved glutamic acid residue (Glu273) critical for catalysis,

is displaced outside the catalytic cleft and is also rotated about its axis, further removing Glu273 from the catalytic cleft. This aC conformation is essentially the same as in most other structures of inactive kinases (Huse and Kuriyan, 2002; Johnson et al., 1996). The activation loop (residues 371­391), which forms part of the polypeptide substrate-binding site and contains the activating phosphorylation site, also has the inactive conformation in the P212121 crystal form. This conformation starts with a short a helix (aT1, residues 369­376) (Figures 5A and S1) followed by a twelve-residue disordered segment (residues 377­388), both aspects typical of the inactive kinase conformation (Huse and Kuriyan, 2002; Johnson et al., 1996). In the P1 crystal form, by contrast, the activation loop of one protomer in each of the four dimers has a conformation related to active kinase structures. The aT1 helix is replaced by the b9 strand (residues 372­374), which forms a b sheet with b6 (residues 343­345) on the C lobe much like active kinase structures (Figure 5A). The segment that follows the b6 strand diverges from the active conformation, however, and a five-residue segment (residues 382­386) is disordered. The CHK2 protomers in both crystal forms have additional conformational features often seen in other inactive kinase structures. These include (1) the disorder in the eight-residue connection (residues 260­267) between the N lobe aB and aC helices, (2) the disorder in the aEF-aF loop that packs with the activation loop in active kinase structures, and (3) the more open arrangement of the N and C lobes and of the catalytic cleft in between them. The structure of the CHK2 kinase domain described here differs in several respects from the structure of the isolated CHK2 kinase domain (residues 210­504) (Oliver et al., 2006). In that structure, the activation loop and following aEF helix (together comprising residues 388­397) are flipped out from one kinase molecule and pack against the active site of another kinase molecule related by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis. The activation loop in that structure forms two helices distinct from the canonical kinase structure. It has been suggested that this crystal-packing interaction may reflect the dimeric intermediate of the activation process, with the swapped activation loops poised for phosphorylation in trans. However, this crystallographic symmetry-related dimer is entirely distinct from the dimer described here. In the crystallographic dimer, ° the two kinases are far apart, with a minimal distance of 17 A if we exclude the swapped region, whereas in our dimer, the two kinase domains are within contact distance at multiple regions (Figure 5B). The relative orientation of the kinases in the two dimers differs substantially as well. When the two dimers are compared by superimposing one protomer in each, the second protomers end up nearly orthogonal to each other, with their ° centers of gravity $37 A apart (Figure 5B). As a result, whereas in our dimer the two kinase active site clefts face each other in close proximity (for example, their catalytic Asp347 side chains ° are within $15 A), the active site clefts in the crystallographic dimer have their sides pointing at each other and they are far ° apart ($37 A distance between their catalytic Asp347 side chains) (Figure 5B). Although the dimer model derived from the isolated kinase structure is not consistent with the dimer structure presented here, we cannot rule out an exchange of C lobe

structural elements, as there are several disordered regions, including portions of the activation loops, that are in close proximity to their dyad-related mates. CHK2 Kinase Activation In the dimer, the catalytic clefts of the two kinase domains face each other in close proximity, in an arrangement that would be ideally suited to increase the effective concentration of one activation loop at the catalytic cleft of the dyad-related kinase. Gly376 and Pro388, the N- and C-terminal ordered residues flanking the disordered segment of the activation ° ° loop are $12 A and $16 A, respectively, of the other proto-

mer's catalytic Asp347, which would interact with the Thr383 phospho-acceptor to activate the hydroxyl group for phosphorylation. Many kinases in the inactive state have residual activity, presumably as a result of the regulatory aC and activation loop elements sampling active conformations in solution. This may be reflected in the P1 crystal form, where one protomer in each dimer has the N-terminal half of its activation loop ordered in a conformation very similar to the canonical active conformation (Figure 5A). The high effective concentration of one activation loop at the active site of the other kinase would then substantially increase the probability that a transient active

conformation in the catalytic cleft would encounter, in trans, the activation loop as a substrate. The model that the optimal arrangement of the two kinases facilitates trans-phosphorylation of the activation loop may be generally applicable to other kinases that get activated by dimerization-mediated trans-phosphorylation. Dissociation of CHK2 Dimers on Activation The dissociation of CHK2 dimers after activation has been suggested to occur through autophosphorylation of FHA domain residues and, in particular, of the Ser140 side chain that contacts the phosphoThr phosphate group (Ahn et al., 2002; Li et al., 2008). To test whether CHK2 activation destabilizes SCDindependent dimerization as well, we expressed the wild-type versions of the crystallized CHK2 (70­512) and also of the SCD-containing CHK2 (40­512) in E. coli. In keeping with previous reports that E. coli-expressed CHK2 is autoactivated (Ahn and Prives, 2002; Manning et al., 2002; Schwarz et al., 2003), mass spectroscopic analysis of tryptic peptides showed that these truncated CHK2 proteins are quantitatively phosphorylated on the activation loop as well as at additional sites, including Ser140 and Thr68 (for CHK2 residues 40­512; data not shown). As shown in Figure 6A, both wild-type-activated proteins eluted as single peaks with retention times corresponding to the monomeric species even at concentrations as high as 480 mM, indicating that kinase activation abolishes the SCDindependent dimerization as well. Structural Basis of Dimer Dissociation after Activation In the dimer, the two kinase domains are within contact distance at two separate interfaces. The structural elements involved in these interkinase interfaces have high temperature factors and disordered regions, so their contribution to dimerization is probably not significant. However, as both of these regions correspond to elements that typically undergo conformational changes or disorder-to-order transitions on kinase activation, these interactions may contribute to the dissociation of the CHK2 dimer after activation (Huse and Kuriyan, 2002; Nolen et al., 2004). One of the three interfaces involves the aB helix from the N lobe packing in a hydrophobic pocket on the C lobe of the other protomer (Figures 6B and S4). The aB helix has high temperature factors, and the eight residues that connect it to the aC helix are disordered. The other interface involves the C lobe aEF-aF loop. Although a portion of this loop (residues ° 398­401) is disordered, the ordered ends are within 5 A of their dyad-related mates (Figures 6B and 6C). The close packing of the two kinase domains raises the possibility that SCD-independent dimerization is disrupted through steric clashes induced by the activation-associated conformational changes (Huse and Kuriyan, 2002; Johnson et al., 1996). To explore this, we sought to construct a dimeric active CHK2 model that reflects the relative orientation of the N and C lobes

In the P1 crystal form (green), part of the activation loop adopts a conformation similar to the active state, which, as seen in the structure of the active PKA (gray) (Zheng et al., 1993), is characterized by the formation of the b9 strand instead of the aT1 helix.

Figure 6. Dissociation of the CHK2 Dimer after Activation
(A) Size-exclusion chromatography profiles of active CHK2 either lacking the SCD (residues 70­512, 470 mM, red) or containing the SCD (residues 40­502, 310 mM, blue) exhibit singe peaks coincident with the monomer peaks of the corresponding kinase-dead CHK2K249R proteins (thinner magenta and cyan lines, respectively). (B) Model of a hypothetical, active CHK2 dimer (yellow and green) superimposed on the inactive dimer structure (red and blue) by aligning the N lobes.

(C) Comparison of the kinase C lobe positions in the inactive structure (red and blue) and in the model of the active dimer (yellow and green), looking up the vertical direction in (B).

For clarity, the disordered activation loop between the start of aEF (residue 388) and the end of b8 is not indicated.

that is characteristic of the active state. Among the known active kinase structures, those with the highest sequence identity to CHK2 are phosphorylase kinase (PhK; PDBID 1PHK), which shares 38% sequence identity with CHK2 and belongs to the CAMK subfamily as CHK2, and protein kinase A (PKA; PDBID 1ATP), which also shares 38% identity but belongs to the related AGC subfamily of kinases (Owen et al., 1995; Zheng et al., 1993). To construct the model of the active CHK2 dimer, we first superimposed active PKA on the inactive CHK2 dimer by aligning their N lobes, excluding the aC helix that is in different conformations. We then used this PKA dimer as a template and superimposed on its C lobes the CHK2 C lobes (Figure 6B). Superpositions with the active PhK structure as a template resulted in a very similar overall arrangement of the CHK2 N and

C lobes, in accord with the conservation of the overall structure among various active kinases (data not shown). The resulting model suggests that both interkinase interfaces would result in extensive steric clashes on activation. The interface between the N lobe aB helix and the C lobe pocket would result in clashes owing to the realignment of the N and C lobes (Figure 6B), whereas the aEF-aF loop and aEF helix would clash with their dyad-related mates because of the realignment of the N and C lobes. This clash could be even more extensive by the likely disorder-to-order transition of the aEF-aF loop, which would pack with the active conformation of the activation loop (Figure 6C). The clash involving the aB helix is of interest, as this region of CHK2 (between b3 and aC) is among the longest ones in the kinase superfamily. On average, it is longer by six residues than in all but one of the 62 kinases of the human

CAMK group and by five residues than in those of the related AGC group (Manning et al., 2002). Overall, the model of the active kinase conformation suggests that the activation-induced conformational changes would push apart the two kinase domains, and this may disrupt either or both of the FHA-KD and FHA-FHA interfaces, contributing to the dissociation of the dimer. Implications for CHK2 Activation The requirement for DNA damage-induced Thr68 phosphorylation and subsequent dimerization for CHK2 activation is well established, but the mechanism through which the dimer forms and promotes activation loop trans-phosphorylation has not been well understood. Several studies have shown that DNA damage and Thr68 phosphorylation are dispensable for dimerization and autoactivation if CHK2 is overexpressed at high enough levels. In E. coli, CHK2 overexpression results in activation loop autophosphorylation and activation of the kinase toward Cdc25 substrates in a time-dependent manner as CHK2 concentrations increase (Lee and Chung, 2001; Schwarz et al., 2003). Ectopic expression of CHK2 in 293 cells similarly results in activation in the absence of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DSBs, in the absence of ATM, or with the T68A mutation (Schwarz et al., 2003). Based on these data, it has been proposed that the requirement for T68 phosphorylation can be bypassed if CHK2 is overexpressed at high enough levels (Schwarz et al., 2003). These observations suggest that there are additional interactions that mediate CHK2 dimerization beyond the simple intermolecular SCD-FHA association, consistent with our crystallographic and biochemical data showing that CHK2 is capable of SCD-independent dimerization. The SCD-independent dimerization affinity is weak by itself, but it would be expected to cooperate with the phosphoThr68-FHA-mediated interactions to increase the overall avidity of dimerization. This may also explain the low ($30 mM Kd) affinity of the isolated FHA domain for a phosphoThr68 SCD peptide (Li et al., 2002). The reciprocal nature of two sets of phosphoThr68-FHA interactions in the dimer has been shown to increase the stability of the dimer (Li et al., 2008), but the extent of this stabilization is not yet known; it is unlikely to be at the limit of adding the two interaction energies, given that the polar and thus likely unstructured nature of the 22 amino acid sequence between the phosphoThr68 segment and the FHA domain would limit the cooperativity of the reciprocal interactions (Figure S1). It is then conceivable that the avidity required for activation is a result of cooperation between the phosphoThr68-FHA interactions and the FHAFHA/FHA-KD interactions reported here. This model is consistent with dimer formation ultimately being dependent on and triggered by the higher-affinity phosphoThr68-FHA interactions. We presume that, in the absence of DNA damage, SCD-independent dimerization either does not occur to any significant extent, or it is of a transient nature that is not stable enough to substantially activate the kinase. If stable SCD-independent dimerization occurred, it could lead to inappropriate, IR-independent CHK2 activation, as has been demonstrated with ectopically overexpressed CHK2. However, it remains possible that transient SCD-independent dimerization contributes to Thr68 phosphorylation after IR.

The role of SCD-independent dimerization is also supported by the I157T Li-Fraumeni mutation, which impairs the dimerization and autophosphorylation of CHK2 overexpressed in CHK2À/À mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFS) (Schwarz et al., 2003). In our dimer structure, Ile157 maps to the hydrophobic center of the FHA-KD interface, where the introduction of a polar group would have a destabilizing effect (Figure 2A). Accordingly, we find that the I157T mutation reduces SCD-independent dimerization in vitro (Figures 4D and 4E). Taken together, these findings support the model that CHK2 activation requires, in addition to DNA damage-induced Thr68-FHA interactions, the SCD-independent FHA-KD and FHA-FHA dimerization interactions. The SCD-independent dimerization may also help explain initial findings that the I157T mutation did not significantly affect dimerization and autophosphorylation of CHK2 overexpressed in cells harboring wild-type CHK2 (Lee and Chung, 2001; Wu et al., 2001). It is conceivable that, in a wild-type CHK2 background, I157T CHK2 activation results from the formation of wild-type mutant heterodimers that would be absent from the experiments in CHK2À/À MEFs. The formation of the wild-type mutant heterodimers, which would have only one of the two FHA-KD interfaces destabilized and would presumably be more stable than the mutant homodimers, could be driven by the high levels of overexpressed mutant CHK2. In addition to increasing the avidity of CHK2 dimerization, the SCD-independent dimer may also play a role in the efficiency of autoactivation by arranging the two kinase domains optimally for trans-phosphorylation of their activation loops. In the dimeric structure, the two kinase active sites face each other, with the ordered segments flanking their disordered activation loops in close proximity. This arrangement would maximally increase the effective concentration of the activation loop of one kinase at the active site of the other, increasing the probability of a productive encounter when the active site samples the active conformation transiently, as suggested by the partial active conformation of kinase in the P1 crystal form. This mechanism could also apply to other kinases that get activated by dimerization-mediated activation loop phosphorylation.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Purification The various human CHK2 proteins were overexpressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), with 0.2 mM IPTG induction at 17 C for $16 hr. The recombinant proteins were first purified by glutathione affinity and anion-exchange chromatography. After cleavage of the GST tag, they were passed over a glutathione sepharose column and were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200). Purified proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration to $12 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (pH 8.0) for crystallization. Crystallization and Structure Determination Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature, with protein solutions supplemented with 3% (v/v) glycerol. The P212121 crystals of CHK2K249R (residues 84­502) were grown from 50 mM Na2SO4 sulfate, 14% (w/v) PEG 3350. The P1 crystals of CHK2K249R (residues 70­512) were grown from 100 mM NaHEPES, 300 mM ammonium tartrate, 22% PEG 3350 (pH 7.0) using the streak-seeding method. For data collection, crystals were flash frozen in crystallization buffer supplemented

with 16%­20% (v/v) glycerol. Diffraction data were collected at the ID24 beamline of the Advance Photon Source and processed using the HKL suite (Otwinowski et al., 2003). The structure was determined by a combination of molecular replacement and multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD). MAD phases were calculated with data from crystals of seleno-methioninesubstituted CHK2K249R (residues 84­502) using the program SHARP (Bricogne et al., 2003). Molecular replacement was carried out with the coordinates of the FHA domain (1GXC) and CaM kinase I (1A06). Iterative cycles of model building and refinement were performed with the programs O (Jones et al., 1991) and REFMAC with TLS parameterization (Winn et al., 2003). Refinement incorpo° rated tight noncrystallographic symmetry (ncs) restraints (0.01 A rmsd in atom positions), except for regions that differ between the two protomers, as described in the main text. The P212121 crystals contain one dimer in the asymmetric unit. In the refined model, both protomers encompass residues 89­501, with residues 260­267 (aB-aC loop), 377­387 (C-terminal portion of activation loop), and 398­401 (aEF-aF loop) disordered. One protomer has additional disordered residues (370­377 and 402­404). The structure of the P1 form was determined by molecular replacement using the refined dimer structure of the P212121 crystal form as the search model. The P1 form contains four dimers in the asymmetric unit. The refined model of four dimers encompasses residues 92­501 of each CHK2, with residues 228­232, 254­ 267, 383­387, and 398­401 disordered. One protomer in each of the four dimers has additional disorder in the activation loop (370­382). Chromatography and Native-Gel Electrophoresis For size-exclusion chromatography analysis, the purified proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration, and 0.1 ml of each sample was loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (GE-Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in 20 mM NaHEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT (pH 7.8). The column was calibrated using the L.M.W. and Gel Filtration Calibration Kits (Amersham Biosciences), and the apparent molecular weight was calculated as instructed in the manual. The dimer fraction for each sample was calculated using the UNICORN software (AKTA). Native-gel electrophoresis was performed using 2.8% polyacrylamide gels in 89 mM Tris-Borate (pH 8.4) at 4 C.
