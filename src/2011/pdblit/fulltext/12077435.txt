High-salt crystals of human oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin have been studied at different levels of environmental humidity and solvent content. The structure of the oxy form remains relatively unchanged at all levels. The deoxy form, however, undergoes a water-mediated transformation when the relative humidity around the crystals is reduced below 93%. The space group is maintained during the transformation, but the unitcell volume nearly doubles, with two tetrameric molecules in the asymmetric unit of the low-humidity form compared with one in the native crystals. Interestingly, the haem geometry in the low-humidity form is closer to that in the oxy form than to that in the native deoxy form. The quaternary structure of one of the tetramers moves slightly towards that in the oxy form, while that in the other is more different from the oxy form than that in the high-salt native deoxy form. Thus, it would appear that, as in the case of the liganded form, the deoxy form of haemoglobin can also access an ensemble of related T states.

1. Introduction
We have been exploring protein hydration and its consequences using an approach involving water-mediated transformations in which protein crystals undergo reversible transformations with a change in the water content when the environmental humidity is systematically varied (Salunke et al., 1984, 1985; Kodandapani et al., 1990; Madhusudan & Vijayan, 1991; Madhusudan et al., 1993; Radha Kishan et al., 1995; Nagendra et al., 1995, 1996, 1998; Sadasivan et al., 1998; Sukumar et al., 1999; Biswal et al., 2000). Using this approach, it has been possible to establish a relationship between hydration, mobility, accessibility and action in hen egg-white lysozyme and bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (Kodandapani et al., 1990; Radha Kishan et al., 1995; Nagendra et al., 1998; Sadasivan et al., 1998; Biswal et al., 2000). In particular, it was established that the overall changes in molecular geometry resulting from the transformation from the native to the low-humidity forms are similar to those that occur during enzyme action. It also turns out that such changes are more pronounced in the active-site region. In another interesting observation, the crystal structure of monoclinic lysozyme with extremely low solvent content (9.4%) suggested that the loss of activity that accompanies dehydration could be the result of the removal of functionally important water molecules from the active-site region and the reduction of the size of the substrate-binding cleft (Nagendra et al., 1998).

The above results encouraged us to extend the studies involving water-mediated transformations to complex multimeric proteins. The obvious choice in this context was haemoglobin, the most thoroughly investigated multimeric protein. Haemoglobin is an 22 tetrameric transport protein of molecular weight 64 500 Da. Much of the current understanding of the allosteric mechanism has resulted from studies on haemoglobin (Perutz et al., 1998; Tame, 1999). In pursuance of the allosteric model proposed by Monod et al. (1965), haemoglobin exists in two states, a low-af®nity state (T) and a high-af®nity state (R). A stereochemical mechanism for the cooperative effects in the tetrameric protein was ®rst proposed by Perutz (1970) primarily on the basis of horse deoxyhaemoglobin (Bolton & Perutz, 1970) and methaemoglobin (Perutz et al., 1968). This mechanism is based on the equilibrium between the tense (T) deoxy state and the relaxed (R) liganded state. Subsequently, new relaxed states have been characterized (Silva et al., 1992; Smith & Simmons, 1994; Kroeger & Kundrot, 1997; Mueser et al., 2000, Biswal & Vijayan, 2001). The equilibrium between R and T conformations is modulated by ions, such as H+, CO2, phosphates and ClÀ. Water has also been proposed to be an allosteric regulator (Colombo et al., 1992). In particular, it has been suggested that the transition from the T to the R state is accompanied by the uptake by the protein of several dozen water molecules (Colombo et al., 1992; Colombo & Seixas, 1999). The effect of, among other things, change in humidity on the crystal packing of horse methaemoglobin was explored in the early days of protein crystallography (Boyes-Watson et al., 1947; Huxley & Kendrew, 1953; Perutz, 1954) in order to derive phase information on some special re¯ections. Protein crystallography was then in its infancy and the work was not followed up by detailed structure analysis. In the meantime, attention shifted substantially from horse to human haemoglobin. Thus, in our study, we concentrated on human deoxy-, oxy- and methaemoglobin. While the crystal structures of human deoxyhaemoglobin (Fermi et al., 1984) and oxyhaemoglobin (Shaanan, 1983) are known, the structure of human methaemoglobin has surprisingly not been determined. Therefore, the methaemoglobin structure, with three tetramers in the asymmetric unit, was analysed (Biswal & Vijayan, 2001). The structure demonstrated that the three molecules have quaternary structures intermediate between those of the R and the R2 structures. R2, observed in crystals grown from a low-salt (0.1 M) medium (Silva et al., 1992), is a relaxed structure substantially different from the conventional liganded form R found in crystals grown from a high-salt (2.5 M) medium. The same intermediate nature was also observed in the disposition of residues in the `switch' region of human methaemoglobin molecules. However, the methaemoglobin crystals did not survive even the slightest reduction in environmental humidity. The subsequent studies were therefore con®ned to human oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin crystals. The results of these studies are reported here.

2. Experimental
2.1. Sample preparation

Human haemoglobin was puri®ed from fresh human blood and crystals of the oxy and deoxy forms were prepared using the protocol described by Perutz (1968). The crystallization buffer had a pH around 6.5 and a molarity of 2.5 M. Different low-humidity forms of the crystals were prepared by placing a drop of a supersturated solution of an appropriate salt (CuSO4.5H2O for a relative humidity of 98%, Na2HPO4.12H2O for 95%, Na2SO4.10H2O for 93%, ZnSO4.7H2O for 90%, K2CrO4 for 88% and KBr for 84%) at about 1 cm from the crystal in a thin-walled capillary. Nearly a day was required for equilibration. A partially dehydrated form of oxyhaemoglobin was also obtained by using a drop of 25% methanol (Boyes-Watson et al., 1947) instead of the salt solution.
2.2. Data collection

Intensity data from the native and the low-humidity forms of the crystals and from the partially dehydrated form of oxyhaemoglobin obtained using 25% methanol were collected on a MAR image plate mounted on an RU-200 Rigaku X-ray generator with a copper anode. Crystal-to-detector distances of 150 mm and 100 mm were used for the oxy and deoxy crystals, respectively. The data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997).

The structures of the low-humidity forms and the 25% methanol form were solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994), with protein molecules from the structures of human deoxyhaemoglobin (Fermi et al., 1984) and human oxyhaemoglobin (Shaanan, 1983; PDB code 1hho) as search models as appropriate. All the structures were È re®ned in a similar manner using CNS (Brunger et al.,

1998) incorporating the cross-validated maximum-likelihood re®nement target. 50 cycles of rigid-body re®nement treating each subunit as a rigid body were carried out. The model was subjected to a 4000 K Cartesian slow-cooling protocol, using the maximum-likelihood function as the target for re®nement. At this stage a map was calculated and manual rebuilding was carried out using FRODO (Jones, 1978) wherever necessary. The re®nement continued using CNS. Once it converged, typically around an R value of 0.23, identi®cation of water molecules began. This was performed in several stages with the help of 2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc maps. After every cycle of model building a few cycles of group B-factor and positional re®nement were performed. Cycles of position re®nement, correction of model using Fourier maps and the identi®cation of water molecules continued until no signi®cant density remained in the map. Rfree values were closely monitored throughout the re®nement. Haem groups were re®ned by applying restraints to bond distances and angles in order to maintain proper geometry (Kuriyan et al., 1986). During most of the re®nement cycles, NCS restraints were applied separately to the - and -subunits in each structure. The restraints were progressively removed and no NCS restraints were used in the ®nal cycles. Towards the end of the re®nement an omit map was calculated (Vijayan, 1980). Such a map is formally independent of the input coordinates and provides an unbiased representation of the structure. The model was carefully checked against this map and the necessary corrections were made. The stereochemical acceptability of the structure was checked using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). lysozyme (Salunke et al., 1985; Madhusudan et al., 1993). Native monoclinic lysozyme contained two crystallographically independent molecules which became equivalent in the low-humidity form after transformation, with a halving of the unit-cell volume. Data collected at r.h. values of 93, 90, 88 and 84% and those collected in the 25% methanol environment were used for further work on oxyhaemoglobin crystals. Native data were also collected and the structure re®ned using the data, but unless otherwise stated the structural results obtained earlier by Shaanan (1983) were used in comparative studies, as these data had better resolution. Data from the native deoxy crystals and the transformed deoxy crystals (90% r.h.) were collected and used for re®nement. However, the deoxy native structure obtained by Fermi et al. (1984) was used for comparisons in view of the better resolution of that structure. Data were not

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preliminary data
Figure 2

The behaviour of the unit-cell parameters and hence the solvent content (calculated using the Matthews method; Matthews, 1968) in response to the systematic reduction in environmental humidity was unexpected in the case of oxyhaemoglobin. To start with, the unit-cell volume remained constant; the cell then expanded and the solvent content increased with further reduction in relative humidity (r.h.), reaching a maximum at about 93% r.h. (Fig. 1). Subsequent reduction in r.h. led to a reduction in the unit-cell volume and solvent content. The resolution of the data also progressively Ê deteriorated, reaching 3.3 A at 84% r.h. Further reduction in environmental humidity resulted in loss of crystallinity. The behaviour of the crystals of deoxyhaemoglobin in response to reduction in environmental humidity was, however, along the expected lines. The solvent content fell slightly in a continuous fashion until the r.h. was lowered to 93% (Fig. 2). Between r.h. 93 and 90% the crystal underwent a transformation with an abrupt loss of solvent. The unit-cell volume almost doubled (Fig. 3) without change in the space group. Two symmetryrelated molecules now became crystallographically independent. It may be recalled that it is just the reverse of what happened in the water-mediated transformation in monoclinic

3.2. Haem stereochemistry

The tertiary structure of the protein is remarkably similar in all the crystal forms. However, the position of the ferrous iron with respect to the porphyrin ring in the low-humidity deoxy crystal presents an interesting case. The relevant distances in the native high-salt (Fermi et al., 1984) and low-salt (Kavanaugh et al., 1992) deoxy crystals, in the native oxy crystals and in the two molecules of the 90% r.h. form are listed in Table 2 and illustrated in Fig. 4. As is well known, the ferrous iron shifts from the haem plane towards the proximal histidine by Ê Ê about 0.6 A (by about 0.4 A from the plane of the porphyrin N atoms) in the deoxy form, while it lies in the plane in the oxy form in both the subunits. Consequently, the distance between the ferrous iron and the coordinating N atoms are a little longer in the former. Surprisingly, the displacement of the ferrous iron from the haem plane and the Fe±N distances in

the low-humidity deoxy form are closer to those in the oxy form than to those in the native deoxy form. Thus, the removal of a small amount of water from the crystals of the deoxy form appears to have the effect of driving the haem stereochemistry towards that in the oxy form. The above result was rather surprising and it was important to critically examine its reliability. Each of the distances quoted in Table 2 is an average over at least two observations except in the case of the native oxy structure. Of the distances, those between the mean plane of the porphyrin N atoms and the ferrous iron are expected to be quite reliable, as each such distance involves a mean plane calculated using four atoms and a comparatively heavy and hence better de®ned metal ion. The distance between the ferrous ion and porphyrin N atoms is also expected to be reliable as the value is averaged over at least four and most often eight observations. The remaining two distances involve at one end a metal ion or a mean plane, but a single atom at the other end. The relevant distances in oxyhaemoglobin have similar values in all oxy structures re®ned by us and in the structure obtained by Shaanan (1983). The same is true in relation to the native deoxy structure re®ned by us and that obtained by Fermi et al. (1984). These

The molecules in the native crystals of oxyhaemoglobin, those at r.h. values of 93, 90, 88 and 84%, that partially dehydrated using 25% methanol, that of native deoxyhaemoglobin, its 90% r.h. form (two molecules) and that of deoxyhaemoglobin grown at low salt were considered for detailed comparisons. One  dimer from one molecule was superposed on an  dimer in the other molecule in each pair. The r.m.s. deviations in main-chain atoms in the superposed dimers (11 subunits) and those in the dimers which were not superposed (22 subunits), were calculated. These values are listed in Table 3.

as a function of solvent content. Independent superposition of - and -subunits also corroborated this conclusion. The changes in the quaternary structure of haemoglobin associated with oxygen binding primarily involves the movement of one  dimer as a whole with respect to the other. The r.m.s. deviation in main-chain atoms of the 22 dimers obtained on the superposition of the 11 dimers of a pair of molecules gives a rough and ready estimate of this movement (Silva et al., 1992). Such deviations in every pair of molecules under consideration are listed in the upper right half of Table 3. As shown by Baldwin & Chothia (1979) and illustrated in Fig. 5, the movements can be described in terms of a screw rotation angle (2 in Fig. 5), the screw rotation translation, the direction of the screw rotation axis and a point on the rotation axis. The same parameters can be used to describe the relationship between the quaternary structures of any two haemoglobin molecules. The values of all four parameters for pairs of different molecules are given in the lower left part of Fig. 6. The ®rst line in the boxes in the lower left part of Fig. 6 corresponds to angle 2 and the translation (given in parentheses). The second line indicates the direction of the rotation axis, whereas the third line de®nes a point on the rotation axis. Also given is the angle 1 between the axes that relate 11 and 22 dimers. These calculations were performed using the computer program ALIGN (Cohen, 1997). The information presented in Table 3 and Fig. 6 indicates no systematic change in quaternary association in the oxyhaemoglobin molecules as a function of water content. On the contrary, systematic though small changes are associated with the deoxyhaemoglobin molecules. Deoxyhaemoglobin molecules in all the crystal forms have, as a group, quaternary structures substantially different to those of oxyhaemoglobin molecules. This difference is characterized by r.m.s. deviations Ê of around 5 A in main-chain atoms in 22 subunits when 11 subunits are superposed and rotations of about 13 of the 22 dimer with respect to the 11 dimer. There are, however, small variations within deoxy molecules. For instance, the r.m.s. deviations and the angles clearly show that the quaternary structure of the deoxy molecule in the high-salt crystals is closer to that of the oxygenated molecules than that of the deoxy molecule in the low-salt crystals. It also turns out that the two crystallographically independent molecules that result when the high-salt form undergoes a water-mediated transformation at 90% r.h. have somewhat different quaternary structures. The quaternary association in one of them moves closer to that in the oxygenated molecule, while that of the other moves further away from the oxygenated form towards that in the low-salt crystals. The difference between the quaternary structures of the two molecules is quite substantial. The r.m.s. deviations in the main-chain atoms between 22 subunits when the 11 subunits in the Ê molecules are superposed turn out to be more than 1 A. The difference also involves a rotation of more than 2 of one of the  dimers. The differences between the molecules in the high-salt and the low-salt crystals could well be considered to have arisen from differences in the composition of the medium. In the low-humidity form, the two crystallographically independent molecules exist in the same medium. Therefore, the two quaternary structures observed in this form

4. Conclusions
Contrary to expectations, changes in the environmental humidity or solvent content of the crystals did not lead to any change in the structure of oxyhaemoglobin. Surprisingly, on the other hand, the haem geometry in deoxyhaemoglobin at low environmental humidity and slightly low solvent content mimics that in oxyhaemoglobin. The molecules in the native low-salt and high-salt deoxyhaemoglobin crystals and the two crystallographically independent molecules in the lowhumidity form present an ensemble of slightly different quaternary structures representing the T state.
