Analysis of the NIRAMI structure Interactions between the loop and the NIR and AMI scaffolds. In AMI the O1 of Thr93 on the T1 copper-binding loop makes a hydrogen bond to the N1 of His56, and the backbone carbonyl of Pro96 forms a hydrogen bond to the N of Arg99. In NIRAMI the His56 equivalent, Asp92, is rotated away from Thr131 on the loop and binds to the water molecule which coordinates the metal at the T2 site. The Arg99 equivalent is Ser137 in NIRAMI and its O atom forms a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Pro134 (the active site hydrogen bonding pattern is discussed further below, and see Table S1). Adjacent to Pro96 in AMI, Phe97 is exposed on the protein's surface. In NIRAMI the equivalent Phe135 side chain, although partly disordered, is buried in a hydrophobic pocket, and the repositioning of this residue may also contribute to alterations in the loop.

Monomer-monomer interactions. In WT NIR the side chains of Val136, Pro137 and Val140 from the T1 copper-binding loop make hydrophobic packing interactions with an adjacent monomer (a buried surface area of 109 Å2), and the side chain of Trp138 is buried within a predominantly hydrophobic cleft of the same subunit. In NIRAMI, residues Thr131, Pro132 (before the coordinating His133) and Pro134 contact the adjacent subunit (a buried surface area of only 56 Å2). No equivalent to Trp138 is present in NIRAMI and the hydrophobic cleft is exposed. The more compact nature of this region in NIRAMI, and most significantly the loss of Trp138, influences the structure of the 74-90 loop and also the -helix which runs from residues 185 to 202. These two regions pack either side of the ligand-containing loop in NIR.

Hydrogen-bonding pattern. The main-chain interactions between the coordinating residues on the loop are maintained in NIRAMI as in AMI (see Table S1). The hydrogen-bonding network between the coordinating Cys, its adjacent amino acid on the loop and the residue next to the Nterminal His89 ligand (Asn90) is slightly modified in NIRAMI as compared to NIR, matching the arrangement found in AMI. A major reason for this change is that Ala131 is adjacent to the Cys130 ligand in NIR, whose side chain cannot form any hydrogen bonds. In NIRAMI and AMI a Thr residue is found in this position whose O1 atom hydrogen bonds to the N2 of Asn90 (this bond is much weaker in NIRAMI as compared to AMI). In NIR this interaction is replaced by a hydrogen bond between the N2 of Asn90 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ala131. The backbone amide of the Asn residue makes a highly conserved hydrogen bond to the coordinating thiolate of the Cys ligand in NIRAMI, NIR and AMI. In NIRAMI an additional strong interaction 2

between the O1 of Asn90 and the S of Cys130 is found. A second hydrogen bond to the Cys from the backbone amide of the residue two after this ligand is present at some T1 copper sites. This interaction is missing in NIRAMI, NIR and AMI as a Pro is found in this position.

carbonyl (O) groups with the distances between the N and O atoms quoted. In the first instance residue numbering is as found in NIRAMI. In situations where the hydrogen bond does not occur in NIRAMI then the residue numbering of NIR or AMI is used as appropriate. In NIR Ala131, His139 and Met144 are found in place of Thr131, His133 and Met136 respectively whilst in AMI
