Abstract Cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) are found in epididymis and granules of mammals, and they are thought to function in sperm maturation and in the immune system. Recently, we isolated and obtained clones for novel snake venom proteins that are classified as CRISP family proteins. To elucidate the distribution of snake venom CRISP family proteins, we evaluated a wide range of venoms for immuno-cross-reactivity. Then we isolated, characterized, and cloned genes for three novel CRISP family proteins (piscivorin, ophanin, and catrin) from the venom of eastern cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus), king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), and western diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox). Our results show the wide distribution of snake venom CRISP family proteins among Viperidae and Elapidae from different continents, indicating that CRISP family proteins compose a new group of snake venom proteins.

Snake venom toxins disturb mammalian homeostasis by such mechanisms as activating or inhibiting blood coagulation factors [1­4] and blocking a variety of ion channels [5­8]. Snake venom toxins include metalloproteinases [3,9­12], serine proteases [13­17], serine protease inhibitors [1,18­20], C-type lectins [21­24], disintegrins [25­27], a-neurotoxins [5,6,28,29], dendrotoxins [7,8,30], and phospholipases [31­35]. Thus, most toxic proteins and peptides can be classified into families on the basis of both amino acid sequences and functional properties. The cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs)1 are secreted proteins found in the epididymis and granules

of mammals, and they appear to have roles in sperm maturation and in the immune system [36,37], though the actual functions of these proteins are virtually unknown. Their sequence conservation spans the entire protein length, and all 16 of their cysteines are strictly conserved. Remarkably, 10 of these cysteines are clustered in the C-terminal third of the proteins. Recently, we isolated 25-kDa proteins, triflin, ablomin, latisemin, and tigrin, from the venoms of the habu snake (Trimeresurus flavoviridis, which inhabits Okinawa, Japan), the Japanese mamushi snake (Agkistrodon blomhoffi, which inhabits Japan), the erabu sea snake (Laticauda semifasciata, which inhabits the ocean off southern Japan, southeast Asia, and eastern Australia), and the Japanese yamakagashi snake (Rhabdophis tigrinus tigrinus, which inhabits Japan), respectively. All four proteins have high identity with CRISP family proteins, with highest identity to helothermine, a toxin from the Mexican beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum horridum) [38­40]. Helothermine is known to alter a variety of ion channels, including voltage-gated Ca2þ channels, voltage-gated Kþ channels, and ryanodine receptors, and so far, it is the only known toxin in the

CRISP family. Triflin, ablomin, and latisemin block depolarization-induced smooth muscle contraction [41]. Most recently, we reported [42] the cloning and characterization of two cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channel blockers, designated pseudechetoxin (PsTx) and pseudecin, from the Australian king brown snake (Pseudechis australis, which inhabits north and central Australia) and the red-bellied black snake (Pseudechis porphyriacus, which inhabits southeast Australia). Although the activities of PsTx and pseudecin are entirely different from those of the above three proteins, PsTx and pseudecin also belong to the CRISP family. These findings strongly suggest that these proteins may constitute a novel venom protein family. Here we describe the characterization of three novel snake venom proteins belonging to this family, and we demonstrate the wide distribution of CRISP family proteins in snake venoms.

rum) was added and incubated for 1 h. Rabbit antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit IgG. After addition of the solution of substrate and chromogen (color development solution, o-phenylenediamine, 1 mg/ml, plus H2 O2 , 0.06%, in 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 5.5) plates were measured with a microtiter plate reader at absorbance at 492 nm. Purification of proteins All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C using an FPLC system (Amersham­Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions containing piscivorin, ophanin, and catrin were identified by ELISA using anti-triflin antiserum. Piscivorin was isolated from the venom of A. p. piscivorus. Two hundred milligrams of the venom of A. p. piscivorus was dissolved in 3 ml of 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0. After centrifugation and filtration (0.22-lm pore filter) for the removal of insoluble materials, venom was applied onto Superdex 75 pg column (diameter 2:6 Â length 60 cm) in the same buffer. Fractions containing piscivorin were dialyzed against 20 mM imidazole­HCl (pH 6.8) before being loaded onto an SP­Sepharose High Performance column (diameter 1:6 Â length 11 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0­0.4 M, developed through 8 column volumes at a flow rate of 2 ml/min). Finally, piscivorin was purified by chromatography on a heparin­Sepharose CL-6B column (diameter 1:6 Â length 10 cm) in 50 mM Tris­ HCl, pH 8.0, which was eluted with a linear gradient of 0­0.2 M NaCl. Piscivorin eluted at a concentration of 0.11 M NaCl, and we typically obtained 2.5 mg from 200 mg of crude venom. Ophanin was purified by two chromatographic steps. O. hannah venom (500 mg) was loaded onto a Superdex 75 pg column (diameter 2:6 Â length 60 cm) as described above and eluted with 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.2 M NaCl. The ophanin fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM imidazole­HCl, pH 6.0, and fractionated on a Mono S column (diameter 0:5 Â length 5 cm). The column was developed with a linear gradient of NaCl in imidazole buffer (0­0.2 M, 1 ml/min). Ophanin eluted at 0.025 M NaCl, and we typically obtained 2.5 mg from 500 mg of crude venom. For the purification of catrin, 200 mg of the venom of C. atrox was applied to the Superdex 75 pg column (diameter 2:6 Â length 60 cm) as described above. The fractions containing catrin from five gel filtration runs were pooled and loaded on Q­Sepharose Fast Flow column (diameter 1:6 Â length 15:5 cm) in 50 mM Tris­ HCl, pH 8.0, and flowthrough fractions were collected. After dialysis against a buffer containing 20 mM imidazole­HCl (pH 6.0), the pooled fractions were applied to an SP­Sepharose High Performance column (diameter 1:6 Â length 11 cm) and eluted by a linear gradient to

Experimental procedures Materials Lyophilized venom of Ophiophagus hannah was purchased from the Japan Snake Institute (Gunma, Japan). Lyophilized venoms of Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus and Crotalus atrox were from Kentucky Reptile Zoo (Kentucky, USA) and Sigma (MO, USA), respectively. Superdex 75 pg, SP­Sepharose High Performance, heparin­Sepharose CL-6B, Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, and Mono S columns were from Amersham­Pharmacia Biotech. The Vydac Protein & Peptide C18 HPLC column and the COSMOSIL 5C18 AR-300 HPLC column were from JASCO (Tokyo, Japan) and Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), respectively. Endoprotease Lys-C was purchased from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Other chemicals were of analytical grade (Sigma­Aldrich, Amersham­Pharmacia Biotech, Wako Pure Chemical Ind., and Kanto Chemical Co.). Antiserum preparation and reactivity Anti-triflin antiserum was prepared from triflin-immunized rabbit. A male New Zealand white rabbit was immunized by 100 lg of purified triflin with complete adjuvant. After three injections at 14-day intervals, whole blood was collected. The serum was extracted by centrifugation, and titration was followed by ELISA. Finally, we obtained the antiserum that reacts to triflin at 1000Â dilution. Antiserum reactivity was assessed by ELISA. Typically, 1.25 lg of crude venom was immobilized to 96-well microtiter plates for 2 h at room temperature. After blocking by incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin, anti-triflin rabbit antiserum (1000Â dilution of antise-

0.2 M NaCl (developed through 8 column volumes). Reactive fractions with anti-triflin antiserum eluted in two peaks at 0.11 and 0.15 M NaCl; we named these catrin-1 and catrin-2, respectively. We obtained 1.3 mg of catrin-1 and 2.2 mg of catrin-2 from 1 g of crude venom. Amino acid sequence analysis Piscivorin, ophanin, and catrin were S-pyridylethylated and digested with endoprotease Lys-C as described previously [41,42]. All the digested samples were separated by C18 reverse-phase HPLC and analyzed on Applied Biosystems protein sequencers (Models 473A and 477) and Shimadzu protein sequencer PPSQ-21A (Shimadzu, Japan). Cloning of cDNAs encoding piscivorin, ophanin, and catrin Complementary DNAs encoding piscivorin, ophanin, and catrin were cloned by RT-PCR as described previously [42] using degenerate primers based on the cDNA sequences of helothermine-like snake venom proteins [41]. Typically, total RNA was isolated from the venom glands of A. p. piscivorus, O. hannah, and C. atrox with ISOGEN (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan). To determine the sequence of the cDNA ends, 50 - and 30 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was carried out using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The primers used in this study were 50 -CTT TTG TAC CAA ACT ATC TG(A/ G) GT(A/G) (A/T)AA TGG CC-30 for 50 -RACE (corresponding to amino acids 114­124 in piscivorin) and 50 CTT GCT GCA GTG CTG C(A/G)A CAG TCT T for 30 -RACE (corresponding to the putative signal peptide). The RACE products were subcloned into the pUC19 or pGEM T-easy vector and sequenced using a DSQ 2000L DNA sequencer (Shimadzu, Japan). Contraction measurements on rat tail arterial smooth muscle Helical strips of endothelium-free rat tail arterial smooth muscle were prepared as described previously [41,43]. The strips were mounted horizontally between two hooks and held at 75 mg resting tension in Hepes/ Tyrode (H-T) solution for 45 min. One hook was connected to a force displacement transducer (TB-612T; Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) that was mounted in a micromanipulator and the other to a second micromanipulator. Solution changes were effected rapidly by rotation of the plate. Once mounted, the strips were treated with H-T solutions containing 1 lM prazosin, to block the effect of norepinephrine via a1 adrenergic receptors, for 30 min. The strips were then exposed to

60 mM KCl H-T solution for 15 min. After washing with calcium-free H-T solution for 5 min, the smooth muscle strips were stimulated with 20 mM caffeine H-T solution. All buffers were at 24 °C and those used for intact strips were preoxygenated with 100% O2 . KCl (60 mM) H-T solution was prepared by replacing the NaCl in HT solution with equimolar KCl. For measuring the effect of the proteins, 1 lM toxin proteins were in H-T solution. Statistical analysis Data for smooth muscle contraction are presented as mean Æ SE values of at least four separate experiments, and the values were analyzed by unpaired Student t test. Values of p < 0:05 were considered statistically different. Construction of phylogenic tree A phylogenic tree was constructed by Genetyx using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean. Because of the significant difference in length of untranslated regions, evolutionary distances were calculated based on the nucleotide sequences of open reading frames.

Results Screening of snake venom CRISP family proteins Previously, we isolated and obtained full-length clones for triflin, ablomin, latisemin, tigrin, pseudechetoxin, and pseudecin, which are CRISP family proteins from the venom of six different snakes [41,42]. To search for additional CRISP family proteins in snake venoms, we screened 15 snake venoms for reactivity to anti-triflin antiserum (Table 1). As expected, there was reactivity to the venoms from which CRISP family proteins had previously been isolated. In addition, venom from A. p. piscivorus, C. atrox, Hemachatus haemachatus, Naja mocanbigue, Naja kaouthia, Naja nivea, and O. hannah showed strong reactivity (>50% compared to the reactivity of Trimeresurus flavoviridis venom, the source of triflin). The venom of Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix, Bothrops jararaca, and Echis sochureki venom had 10­ 50% reactivity, but we could not detect any signal in the venom of Notechis scutatus or Oxyuranus scutellatus. Immunoreactivity was thus found in venoms of 14 of 16 snakes, including members of the families Viperidae and Elapidae. Isolation of piscivorin, ophanin, and catrin Using anti-triflin antiserum as the detection reagent, we isolated the immunoreactive proteins from three

snake venoms by column chromatography: eastern cottonmouth (A. p. piscivorus), king cobra (O. hannah), and western diamondback rattlesnake (C. atrox). Piscivorin was purified from crude venom of A. p. piscivorus through three steps of column chromatography: gel-filtration, cation-exchange, and heparin­Sepharose affinity chromatography. Piscivorin eluted from the heparin­Sepharose at 0.11 M NaCl (bold line in Fig. 1A). The purified piscivorin migrated at a Mr of 24.1 kDa on SDS­PAGE under nonreducing conditions and at 27.9 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 1D). Ophanin was isolated from O. hannah venom by gelfiltration and cation-exchange chromatography. Ophanin eluted from the cation-exchange column at $0.025 M NaCl (bold line, Fig. 1B). Purified ophanin migrated at 28.6 kDa on nonreducing SDS­PAGE and at 30.9 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 1D). Catrin was purified from C. atrox venom by three chromatographic steps: first gel-filtration and then the flowthrough fraction of anion-exchange chromatography was purified by cation-exchange chromatography. The immunoreactivity with anti-triflin antiserum was found in two peaks, which eluted at 0.11 and 0.13 M NaCl (Fig. 1C). We named these catrin-1 and catrin-2 in the order of elution. Catrin-1 and catrin-2 had essentially identical molecular masses on SDS­PAGE, with 24.1 kDa under nonreducing conditions and

27.9 kDa under reducing conditions. N termini and partial amino acid sequences of these proteins were determined by enzymatically digested peptides (underlined in Fig. 2). Cloning of piscivorin, ophanin, and catrin cDNAs Complementary DNAs encoding piscivorin, ophanin, and catrin were cloned by RACE using degenerate primers based on sequences of known snake venom CRISP family proteins. The nucleotide sequences of piscivorin and ophanin cDNAs were 1323 and 1367 bp and contained open reading frames of 240 and 239 codons, respectively (Fig. 2). In the attempt to find cDNAs encoding catrin-1 and catrin-2, we sequenced over 50 cDNAs, but all represented the same sequence. This was a cDNA of 1367 bp encoding a product of 240 amino acids (Fig. 2). Analysis of the N-terminal sequences using the signal peptide prediction program PSORT II coincided with the results of sequencing of purified proteins, indicating that the mature proteins have 221 amino acids with predicted molecular masses of 24,712 (piscivorin), 24,960 (ophanin), and 24,677 (catrin). As expected, the deduced amino acid sequences were highly similar to those of other snake venom CRISP family proteins (Fig. 3).

The reactivity of anti-triflin is indicated as open circles (A492). For detailed purification procedures, see Experimental procedures. D shows SDS­PAGE of snake venom CRISP family proteins under nonreducing (lanes 1­4) and reducing (lanes 5­8) conditions. The positions of molecular mass markers are shown on the left. Lanes 1 and 5 show piscivorin (24.1 and 27.9 kDa), lanes 2 and 6 show ophanin (28.6 and 30.9 kDa), lanes 3 and 7 show catrin-1 (24.1 and 27.9 kDa), and lanes 4 and 8 show catrin-2 (24.1 and 27.9 kDa).

The predicted amino acid sequences were compared to sequences of the protease-digested fragments of the purified proteins. The peptide sequences of piscivorin and ophanin were found in the predicted amino acid sequences with 100% identity (Fig. 2, underlined). In catrin, we could not detect any difference between the sequences of the peptides generated from catrin-1 and -2, although Thr159 predicted from the cDNA was replaced by Tyr159 in the peptide sequences of both catrin1 and -2. The other peptides from catrin-1 and -2 were in good agreement with the predicted amino acid sequence from catrin cDNA. The masses of the four proteins were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The masses piscivorin and ophanin were 24,842.8 and 25,037.4, respectively, and identical to molecular masses predicted from cDNA sequences within the experimental errors of 0.53% and 0.27%. In catrin, the mass of catrin-1 (24,747.1) was slightly larger than that of catrin-2 (24,729.9), but the molecular masses were consistent with the predicted molecular mass from cDNA sequence within the experimental errors of 0.29 and 0.22%, respectively. These data also confirm that these

proteins are the appropriate gene products of cloned cDNAs. Effects of piscivorin, ophanin, and catrin on rat tail arterial contraction To compare their activities with those of the venom CRISP proteins isolated previously, we examined the effects of piscivorin, ophanin, catrin-1, and catrin-2 on high Kþ - or caffeine-induced contraction of rat tail arterial smooth muscle at the concentration of 1 lM; 1 lM piscivorin, ophanin, and catrin-2 showed a mild but significant inhibition of contraction evoked by high Kþ . Compared to the control contraction, piscivorin reduced the contractions to 79:2 Æ 4:5% activity (p < 0:05, n ¼ 4), ophanin to 84:13 Æ 0:89% activity (p < 0:05, n ¼ 4), and catrin-2 to 70:7 Æ 3:4% activity (p < 0:05, n ¼ 6); all three were weaker inhibitors than ablomin (55:5 Æ 3:6%; p < 0:05, n ¼ 4), triflin (46:0 Æ 3:9%; p < 0:05, n ¼ 4), and latisemin (37:0 Æ 3:3%; p < 0:05, n ¼ 4). Catrin-1 did not significantly affect high Kþ -induced contraction (90:3 Æ 4:1% vs control, n ¼ 6). None of the proteins inhibited contractions evoked by caffeine.

Discussion Recently, we reported the cloning and characterization of six novel snake venom proteins that are homologous to CRISPs from mammals and to helothermine from the Mexican beaded lizard [41,42]. Three of them, ablomin (A. blomhoffi, Viperidae), triflin (T. flavoviridis, Viperidae), and latisemin (L. semifasciata, Elapidae) inhibit depolarization-induced contraction of rat tail arterial smooth muscle, showing the properties of L-type Ca2þ channel blocking toxins, although tigrin (R. tigrinus tigrinus, Colubridae) does not [41]. The other proteins, named PsTx (P. australis, Elapidae) and pseudecin (P. porphyriacus, Elapidae), block olfactory and retinal

CNG channel currents [42]. In this study, we showed that proteins immunoreactive with anti-triflin antiserum are widespread in snake venoms, including those of Viperidae, Elapidae, and Colubridae snakes that inhabit all five continents. We also report the isolation and cloning of three novel snake venom CRISP family proteins from eastern cottonmouth (A. p. piscivorus, Viperidae, which inhabits the United States), king cobra (O. hannah, Elapidae, which inhabits Southeast Asia), and western diamondback rattlesnake (C. atrox, Viperidae, which inhabits the United States and Mexico), which we named piscivorin, ophanin, and catrin. These data reveal that CRISP family proteins are widely distributed in snake venoms. Other research groups also reported the detection and characterization of homologous proteins from the venom glands (DuvernoyÕs secretion) of Colubridae snakes [44] and Viperidae and Elapidae snakes.2 A phylogenetic tree constructed from the nucleotide sequences of all known snake venom CRISP family proteins is shown in Fig. 4. As expected, the branches nearly correspond to the current taxonomic classification. In the Viperidae branch, piscivorin (from A. p. piscivorus) and ablomin (from A. blomhoffi) are divided into different branches, despite their closeness. A. blomhoffi, which inhabits Japan, is most closely related to Trimeresurus flavoviridis, which also inhabits Japan, while A. p. piscivorus, which inhabits the United States, is close to C. atrox, which inhabits the United States and Mexico. The branches correspond more to the geographical distribution rather than the current taxonomic classification of these species. Ophanin (from O. hannah, Elapidae) falls near the Viperidae branch rather than the Elapidae branch, suggesting that O. hannah is more closely related to the Viperidae snakes than to other Elapidae snakes, such as Oxyuraninae (P. australis, P. porphyriacus) and Laticaudiinae (L. semifasciata). In this regard, these proteins, because of their wide distribution, are useful for studying the evolutionary relationships of venomous snakes. In this study, we also showed that these snake venom CRISP family proteins inhibited depolarization-induced smooth muscle contraction to different extents. Due to the differences in their blocking activities, sequence comparisons suggest a site that may be critical for inhibition of channel activity. Phe189 and Glu186 are the most likely functional residues; strong blockers of smooth muscle contraction (ablomin, triflin, and latisemin) have Phe189 , and all blockers of contraction (ablomin, triflin, latisemin, piscivorin, and catrin) except ophanin have Glu186 (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3. Sequence alignment of snake venom CRISP family proteins. The residues identical to ablomin are shadowed. Gaps (-) have been inserted to maximize identity. All cysteine residues are shown in reversed character. The numbering of residues corresponds to that of ablomin. Sequences are arranged in order of the blocking activity on depolarization-induced smooth muscle contraction. The sequences of catrin-1 and catrin-2 used in this figure are identical (see text). Numbers on the end of each sequence are identity (%) versus ablomin and inhibitory activity at the concentration of 1 lM on smooth muscle contraction (% inhibition). N.D., not determined. The underline indicates the sequence (Asp-Val-Phe) found on L-type channel blocking conotoxin TxVII [45].

catrin-2 showed similar inhibitory potency (37.0 and 29.3%, respectively), they have Phe or Tyr in this position. In this study, we obtained only one cDNA corresponding to catrin; therefore, the sequence of catrin-2 in this position is possibly different (see below for further details). Our previous work suggested that residues near this region (Lys174 and Arg175 in PsTx) may interact with CNG channels, based on sequence comparison and blocking affinity of PsTx and pseudecin. Considering these facts, we presume that the region around residues 184­189 may be the functional site of snake venom CRISP family proteins. PsTx and pseudecin also have Phe in this position, however; pseudecin affected neither depolarization- nor caffeine-induced contraction (data not shown). These data suggest that residues in addition to Phe and Glu also contribute to the activities; however, further investigation is required to obtain additional information about functional residues. Triflin, latisemin, piscivorin, and tigrin did not block CNG

channels at all, while ablomin showed a little inhibition on CNGA1 channels (R. Lane Brown, unpublished observations). These results strongly indicate that the residues involving the inhibitory activity on depolarization-induced contraction and those related to CNG channel blocking activity are different, although the region around residues 184­189 may be concerned in their functions. Recently, x-conotoxin TxVII was isolated from the venom of the molluscivorus marine snail Conus textile and found to block dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca2þ channels [45]. Although x-conotoxin TxVII shares a similar three-dimensional structure with other x-conotoxins [46], TxVII is greatly enriched in hydrophobic residues; therefore, the exposed hydrophobic residues of TxVII are proposed as functional residues. Interestingly, the sequence (Asp187 -Val188 -Phe189 ) in the exposed hydrophobic region of TxVII is also found in ablomin near the proposed functional region (underlined in Fig. 3),

Fig. 4. Phylogenetic tree of snake venom CRISP family proteins. A phylogenetic tree of nine snake venom CRISP family proteins was constructed from their nucleotide sequences in the open reading frame by the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean. The evolutionary distances calculated from Genetyx are shown on each line. Note that we obtained only one cDNA corresponding to catrin-1 and catrin-2 (see text); therefore, they are shown as ``catrin'' in this figure.

although it is not present in other snake venom CRISP family proteins. Because of their inhibition of depolarization-induced rat tail artery contraction, ablomin, triflin, and latisemin may also be L-type Ca2þ channel antagonists [41]. These facts might indicate that this region of ablomin is crucial to biological activity. Residue 159 of catrin (the spotted residue in Fig. 2C) differed in the sequences predicted from the cDNA (threonine) and from the peptide sequence (tyrosine). We analyzed over 50 clones from amplified cDNAs; however, we could not obtain a cDNA that encoded a tyrosine at this position. The peptide was obtained from snake venom derived from hundreds of snakes, while the cDNAs were derived from the venom gland of a single snake. For this reason, we concluded that this sequence discrepancy probably resulted from differences in individual snakes. In addition, we could not find any sequence differences between catrin-1 and catrin-2 by either peptide sequencing or cDNA cloning, although catrin-2 weakly inhibited depolarization-induced contraction, but catrin-1 did not. In MALDI-TOF MS analysis, the molecular mass of catrin-1 appears slightly larger than that of catrin-2 (24,747.1 and 24,729.9, respectively). Based on these findings, catrin-1 and catrin2 might have one or more different amino acid residues, which were not determined by the peptide sequence analysis. Additional studies are, however, required to elucidate this difference. In gel-filtration fractions of the

venom of Naja annulifera (inhabitant of South Africa; former name Naja haje), we also detected two proteins immunoreactive with anti-triflin antiserum, and these proteins had different apparent molecular weights in SDS­PAGE (28.8 and 27.2 kDa) and different N-terminal sequences (unpublished data). These data suggest that snakes in addition to C. atrox contain at least two different CRISP family proteins in their venoms. In conclusion, we have shown the wide distribution of CRISP family proteins in the venoms of three different families of snakes that inhabit different continents, and we have isolated and cloned cDNAs of three novel CRISP family proteins, piscivorin, ophanin, and catrin, from the venom of A. p. piscivorus, O. hannah, and C. atrox, respectively. Moreover, we have proposed the putative functional region of these proteins by the comparison of the amino acid sequence and the strength of inhibition of depolarization-induced smooth muscle contraction. Future study of the structures and functions of these proteins will be useful to test this hypothesis.
