Relatively low levels of both enzymes were observed in the glomeruli. The parenchyma of the spleen showed the lowest concentrations of MAO-A and MAO-B. Especially enriched in both enzymes were the capsula, the trabeculae and the blood vessel walls. In duodenum, a clearly different pattern of distribution of MAO-A and MAO-B was observed.

Discu,;sion -In the present study we report the distribution of MAO-A and MAO-B in aged human peripheral tissues by means of quantitative cnvmc: autoradiography.

We found [`H]Ro4! - 1049 and [jH]lazabemide to be suitable radioligands also for +k study nf MAO-A and MAO-B m sections of human peripheral tissues. Their binding was specific, isoenzyme selectiI,e and of high af!!in!ty. Saturation curves yielded K,, estimates in the 11ownM range with both radioligands. A similar affimty of the two radioligands for their respective MAO isoenzyme is a necessary condition to compare the values obtained with a single radioligand concentration (e.g. Figure 2). Further studies are required to confirm the similar K,, estimates obtained in these experiments with both radioligands and also to extend these estimatiorls to other human tissues. Age and post-mortem delay are factors that may have an influence in the data here presented. Age-related changes of MAO are known to occur m human brain ( 18). Concerning peripheral tissues it is known that aging atfects MAO in rodent heart. though the pattern of changes varies in different species ( 10,13,19). but we are not ,aware of age-related changes of MAO in any ot the human peripheral tissues studied. If they existed. the data here shown could undergo modifications given the advanced age of the individuals included. The post-mortem dela), was shoerter than 20 hours. Since post-mortem delav of up to 70 hours have been shown not to affect MAO activity ( 18), it seems unlikely that this &ctor may have altered the original MAO-A and MAO-B levels in our samples. The MAO-A and MAO-B binding values obtained in the structures analyzed was homogenous (SEM always lower than 209'0) suggesting that the various causes of death of the cases included may not hate markedly affected MAO-A and MAO-B. Our experiments, in agreement with previous measurements of enzyme activity (20), show that human myocardium contains high levels of both isoenzymes, but MAO-B is the predominant forin. This is in clear contrast to rodents. since in rat heart MAO-A is very abundant and MAOB almost absent ( IO) and the reverse is true for the mouse heart ( I2,13) and such prevalence of trhe A-form in rats and of the B-form in mice is even greater in old animals (10,13,19). in rat heart MAO-A is located in myocardial cells (2 I ), but is absent or very poorly expressed in the sympathetic innervation (22), whereas MAO-B is found in scattered ceils with the morpholog? of parasympathetic neurons (23). Since rat myocardial cells have noradrenaline uptake mechanisms (24), the deammation of noradrenaline could be caused in myocardial cells b> MAO-A. The homogenous distribution of MAO-A and MAO-B in human myocardium seems to indicate that both forms are present in myocardial cells. the predominant cell type. In human lung MAO-A and MAO-B were filund in moderate levels, MAO-A being more abundant. but the MAO-A:MAO-B ratio was not as high as in an earlier report (20). Both enzymes had a similar, homogenous distribution, and their main localization was probably the alveolar walls. The abundance and distribution were similar to that of rodent lung ( IO, 12). It is therefore likely that human and rodent MAO have a similar physiological role, the deaminatlon of loca!lv-relensod noradrenaline and circulating adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopap?+:: that are taken up b!r the !u.r?zth:.ou$: an uptake I -hke mechanism (X,26).

Human liver was found to have the highest levels of MAO-A and MAO-B of all tissues studied, in agreement with previous reports (20). We observed a homogenous distribution of MAO-A in human liver, in accordance with the rat distribution (IO). However, MAO-B was also found to be homogenously distributed in human !iver, in contrast to the patchy pattern of MAO-B in rat it, ,(,, __ ._ ,...^,. I: .,__,\ 1-lt UUL1" :i,.

Human and rodent ktdney differ not only III the abundance MAO's but also rn their distribution, espectally in the case of MAO-B. Rodent kidney is almost devoid of MAO-B with the exceptton of a population of cortical tubuli (10.12), probably proximal convoluted tubuli (27). In human kidney we drtl not observe this pattern of MAO-B distribution The enzyme was found in cortex and rn medulla. with hrgher levels 111 the fonner, but with a homogenous drstributron in both Thus drstrrlxrtion suggests that MAO-B. and MAO-A, arc located In all populanons oftubulr m human kidney The physrological substrates ofrenal MAO may Include sympathetic noradrenaline. circulatrng amrnes that may be taken up tn kidney, and endogenously synthesized dopamrne (28 I and serotonrn (29).

In the parcnchyma ofthe spleen low and simtlar levels of both enzymes were measured. Again. this IS rn contrast with the rodent tissue. in whrch MAO-A is much more abundant than MAO-B ( lkl2) In rat spleen most MAO IS found In svmpathetrc tennrnals (22).

On the other hand. MAO-B was hghest in the nuscular layers. These patterns of distribution closely resemble those found in rat duodenum ( 10) In rodent intestine, MAO-A - and not MAOB- IS present 111 the sympathetic innenatron (3 I) but most of the entertc MAO-A IS e\-traneuronal (2) In the mucosa. where the levels of MAO-A are highest. the enzyme is most probably involved in the deamination of dieta? amInes. This function is of great importance in man as shown by the appearance of severe hypertensrce crisis when MAO-A is inhibited and tyramine-rich foodstuffs are ingested The role of enteric MAO-B is less clear. It is found in Intrinsic non-serotonergic nerve cells (3 1) with, an unknown function. Though not involved in the deamination of dietary tyranxne (32 ). mucosal MAO-B may catalyze the deamination of other dretarv ammes In conclusion, these experiments show that aged human peripheral tissues contain MAO-A and MAO-3 and that their d!rtribl~tron can be mapned and auantitird with the radioligands [`I I]Roll- 1049 and [%r]la.~ab::i%de In the duodenum. we found a markedly different pattern of distribution oi M.-\.S-A a~!d MAC-G H~1.rCZV~:. the ct!!or IIYSUCS anal;,,&, !!e:e II! &r,trib&ion of

MAO-A and MAO-B, though not identical, were not as markedly different as in rodent tissues. In the case of heart, liver, kidney and spleen, very strong differences in the abundance an&or distribution of the enzymes, especially MAO-B, were observed. In these tissues caution should be exercised when extrapolating the data ob?ained on the m!e of MAO from rodent to humans. I-L,. JII1I11c(I ?.ChdAfi h ,....A i\nnr\ .I:"`..;L..r:^- ^.. -.--,.I..
