A B S T R A C T Aurora family kinases regulate important events during mitosis including centrosome maturation and separation, mitotic spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation. Misregulation of Aurora kinases due to genetic amplification and protein overexpression results in aneuploidy and may contribute to tumorigenesis. Here we report the discovery of new small molecule aminothiazole inhibitors of Aurora kinases with exceptional kinase selectivity and report a 1.7 Å cocrystal structure with the Aurora B:INCENP complex from Xenopus laevis. The compounds recapitulate the hallmarks of Aurora kinase inhibition, including decreased histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation, failure to complete cytokinesis, and endoreduplication.

o maintain fidelity of DNA segregation during cell division, sister chromatids are separated and transported to the cell poles by the mitotic spindle. Errors during this process have the potential to affect genome integrity, which may lead to deregulated growth and tumorigenesis (1). In recent years there has been a focus on understanding the signaling mechanisms involved in the regulation of chromosome separation. It has been established that certain families of protein kinases, such as the Nima-related kinase 2, Pololike kinase (1), and Aurora kinases (2, 3) are involved in regulating centrosome and spindle function. Aurora kinases were first discovered in a yeast screen for mutants that displayed improper ploidy following cell division (4). In Drosophila, mutations in Aurora kinase were found to prevent centrosome separation thereby resulting in monopolar spindles (5). There are three known isoforms of Aurora kinase in mammals, Aurora A, B, and C. While Aurora A and B are ubiquitously expressed, Aurora C shows predominant expression in the testis suggesting a possible role in meiosis (6, 7). Although the kinase catalytic domains of all three Aurora isoforms exhibit strong similarity (sequence identity between Aurora B and C to Aurora A is 75% and 72%), the cellular localization, regulation, and substrate specificity of these kinases vary. Aurora A is localized to the centrosome and spindle poles from late S and early G2 through M phase (7). Aurora A binds to and is activated by TPX2 at the G2/M transition, which targets Aurora A to the mitotic spindles (8). Aurora A can phosphorylate histone H3 on serine 10 during centrosome maturation and spindle assembly (9). Aurora B is a chromosome

passenger protein that moves from centromeres to the spindle midzone during mitosis. Aurora B is located at the central spindle during late anaphase and at the midbody during telophase and cytokinesis (10). The presence of Aurora B at the mitotic spindle appears to be mediated via binding to inner centromere protein (INCENP) and survivin (11). Like Aurora A, Aurora B can phosphorylate histone H3 on serine 10, but only Aurora B seems necessary for this phosphorylation in vivo (12). Aurora B is proposed to regulate chromosome condensation and cohesion, bipolar chromosome attachment, the spindle checkpoint and chromosome segregation (12). Although less is known about the importance of Aurora C, it can complement some of the functions of Aurora B (13). Aurora A is located at chromosome 20q13 in a region commonly found to be genetically amplified in breast and colon cancer. Both Aurora A and B have the ability to transform cell lines (NIH3T3 or CHO) which are then capable of forming tumors in mice (14­16). The roles of the Aurora kinases in cell cycle and tumorigenesis have made them potential targets for the development of small molecule therapeutics. Recently numerous small molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases have been described - the trisubstituted pyrimidine VX-680

The cellular effects of ZM447439 (at 2 M) and Hesperadin (at 50 nM) appear to mimic those induced by siRNA knockdown of Aurora B including inhibition of serine 10 phosphorylation of histone H3, improper chromosome alignment at metaphase, loss of the spindle checkpoint, and anaphase progression, suggesting that compounds are capable of inhibiting Aurora B in cells. VX-680 inhibits all isoforms of Aurora (A, B, and C) in vitro whereas no data are available for the activity of ZM44739 on Aurora C and Hesperadin on Aurora A and C (17­19). INH-9d (20) is a potent Aurora inhibitor (Aurora A, B, and C enzymatic IC50 for A, B, C 27, 135, 120 nM) that blocks histone H3 phosphorylation at 1 M and displays antiproliferative effects on various tumor cell lines at concentrations between 50 and 500 nM. Since one of the main goals in developing Aurora kinase inhibitors is to use them as probes of Aurora function in cellular processes and to investigate their antiVOL.3 NO.3 · 180­192 · 2008

220 nM), and Src (IC50 350 nM) (18). INH-9d is relatively nonspecific and inhibits a variety of tyrosine kinases including Abl, TrkA, Ret, FGFR1, Lck, and VEGFR2 at concentrations similar to those that inhibit Aurora (20). Collectively, these data indicate that some of the activity of these compounds in cellular experiments and in vivo may result from significant off-target contributions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In an effort to discover new inhibitors of Aurora A kinase, we screened a library of 4000 kinase-directed heterocycles using a scintillation proximity assay in 384well format. A His-tagged kinase domain of human Aurora A kinase (residues 107­403) expressed in baculovirus and purified by nickel affinity chromatography was used for the assay (24). Several different scaffolds including 4,6-disubstituted pyrimidines, thiazoles, and pyrazoles emerged as possible leads and were evaluated for their kinase selectivity and for their effects on the cell cycle. We chose to focus our attention on a series of 2-aminophenyl-5-bromothiazoles, such as compound 3, because this class demonstrated the highest degree of kinase selectivity among the available leads, because they were not previously reported as inhibitors of Aurora kinase, and because they possessed a low molecular weight (Figure 2). In order to determine whether the inhibitors were competitive with ATP, we performed kinetic analysis at varied ATP, inhibitor, and substrate concentrations. This analysis demonstrates that aminothiazole analogue 3 acts as a mixed competitive inhibitor versus ATP (Supplemental Figure 1A) and noncompetitive versus substrate (data not shown). Due to the small size of 3 and the observation that it was acting as a mixed competitive inhibitor with respect to ATP, we sought to develop a kinase binding assay that could be used to prove whether the compound were indeed binding in the ATP-binding site. We synthesized a fluorescently labeled derivative in which fluoroscein isothiocyanate was coupled through a poly(ethylene glycol) linker to 3 to yield compound 76 (Supplemental Figure 3). Compound 76 possessed an IC50 of 1.43 M for inhibition of Aurora A kinase activity, demonstrating that the activity of the original screening hit 3 was maintained. Binding of compound 76 to Aurora A was competitive with respect to both potent aminothiazole analogues (such as 24 and 27) (Supplemental Figure 1C). Inactive aminothiazole analogues (58) and ATP had little

tumor activity, it would be valuable to have tool compounds that are highly selective kinase inhibitors. Hesperadin is reported to inhibit Mek1, Mapkap-K1, Ampk, Chk1, Phk (phosphorylase kinase), and Lck when tested against a panel of 25 kinases at a concentration of 1 M (and Cdk1 at slightly higher concentrations) (19). ZM447439 does not show any effects on spindle bipolarity and may not inhibit Aurora A, which is commonly overexpressed in cancer cells. ZM447439 has been reported to inhibit Mek1, Src, and Lck in a limited panel of 16 kinases. VX-680 inhibits a variety of kinases including Flt3 (IC50 30 nM), Lck (IC50 80 nM), Itk (IC50 182

Synthesis of 5-Halo and 5-Cyanoaminothiazole Analogues. In order to efficiently vary the aniline portion of compound 3 in our investigation of structure­ activity relationships, we utilized a two-step synthetic sequence starting from the desired arylthioureas. The

first step involved the formation of the thiazole ring by reaction of arylthiourea with 1,2-dichloro-1-ethoxyethane and the second step consisted of bromination in acetic acid (Supplemental Figure 2). Replacement of the thiazole 5-bromo substitutent with chloro or iodo was achieved by reaction of arylthiazol-2-yl-amine with N-chlorosuccinimide or N-iodosuccinimide. Synthesis of 5-cyano analogues was accomplished by amination of 2-chlorothiazole with tert-butyldimethylsilyl-protected (6-aminopyridin-3-yl)methanol using sodium hydride, followed by deprotection with HF-pyridine, conversion to the chloride, and nucleophilic displacement with various amines (Supplemental Figure 2). Details for synthesis and compound characterization are described in Methods. Summary of Structure­Activity Relationships. Over 70 aminothiazole analogues were evaluated in a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) for their ability to inhibit Aurora A kinase activity; the resulting IC50 data are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Structure­activity relationships (SARs) for this scaffold as an Aurora kinase inhibitor are summarized in Figure 3. We first investigated analogues in which the 2-(4-fluorophenylamino)-substitutent of the screening hit compound, 3, was varied. Substitution of the 2-aminophenyl at the para-position resulted in the greatest enhancement in potency against Aurora A and was, interestingly, associated with a wide variety of functionality. Both electron-withdrawing groups, such as fluoro (1­4), carboxylate (24), and carboxyamides (25, 27, 28), and electron-donating groups, such as hydroxyl (13), amino (20), and methoxy (14), produced marked increases in inhibitory activity against Aurora A. Substitutions at the ortho- and meta-positions of the phenyl ring are less tolerated. In addition to the 2-phenylamino substituted thiazole, thiazoles with benzoylamino (56), 2-naphthylamino (59), or pyridylamino (60­62) groups also exhibit single-digit micromolar potency against Aurora kinase; however, a limited exploration of simple amino (54), acylamino (55), urea (57), and alkylamino (58) substituents showed diminished activity against Aurora A. N-Methylation of the 2-amino group to yield compound 5 resulted in a loss of activity consistent with formation of a critical hydrogen bond with Ala173 located in the kinase hinge region. When exploring variations at the thiazole 4- and 5- positions, we found that compound 3b, bearing a bromine at the 4-position instead of 5-position of the aminothiazole, exhibited no activity. Variation of the halogen at the 184

5-position of the aminothiazole revealed that bromo (3) and iodo (4) groups have comparable activity (IC50 500 nM) while the chloro (2) derivative is 2-fold less active. A cyano group at 5-position is also tolerated (63­73 in Table 2), with a variety of analogues showing activity in the single-digit micromolar range. In order to determine how kinase selectivity was altered during the course of the structure­activity optimization, kinase profiling was performed against a panel of 40 different kinases at a concentration of 10 M (Upstate Biotechnology). The original hit, 3, displayed a high degree of selectivity for Aurora A kinase with no appreciable inhibition of other kinases at the screening concentration of 10 M (Figure 2). Aminothiazole 25 inhibited all three Aurora kinases with similar potency when tested using the Z=-LYTE (Invitrogen) assay format at a ATP concentration equal to the apparent Km (Aurora A IC50 529 nM, Km,app 10 M; Aurora B IC50 577 nM, Km,app 64 M; Aurora C IC50 758 nM, Km,app 26 M). The most potent inhibitors in the current aminothiazole series, 24 and 25, mostly retained a high degree of selectivity toward Aurora A but also demonstrated some degree of inhibition of Flt3, CDK1/CyclinB, and TrkB. The 50% inhibition values (IC50s) for 3, 24, and 25 were 0.37, 0.96, and 0.44 M for Flt3 and 10 M, 10 M, and 4.27 M for CDK1/ cyclinB, respectively (Figure 2). No activity up to a concentration of 10 M was observed against TrkB in a cellular assay (25). It is interesting to note that VX-680 also exhibits cross reactivity between Aurora A and Flt3, suggesting a predilection to a similar inhibitory pharmacophore despite being phylogenetically quite distinct protein kinases. In order to further test the ability of the aminothiazoles to inhibit other kinases, we profiled 25 at a concentration of 1 M against a panel of 352 diverse kinases using an in vitro ATP-site competition binding assay (Supplemental Table 3) (26). With this assay, inhibitor 25 only showed binding affinity to Aurora kinases. Comparison of the profile of aminothiazole 25 with clinical Aurora kinase inhibitors such as VX-680 and INH-35 (AZD1152) against the same panel of kinases revealed that 25 is considerably more selective (27). The combination of biochemical and in vitro binding assays demonstrates that aminothiazoles 24 and 25 are selective Aurora kinase inhibitors and potentially promising scaffolds for further elaboration to obtain more potent inhibitors.

ARTICLE
Structure Determination of Aminothiazoles with Aurora Kinase. The high degree of kinase selectivity of the aminothiazoles is unexpected as these small structures possess the requisite hydrogen bond donor and acceptor functionality that could presumably interact with the hinge region of numerous kinases. In order to understand the structural basis for the activity and selectivity of these aminothiazoles, we determined the crystal structure of analogue 25 in the active site of the Aurora B:INCENP complex from Xenopus laevis (Xl) (28). The amino acid sequences of Xenopus laevis and human Aurora A and B are highly homologous to each other (Supplemental Table 1). The crystals contain a tight complex of residues 60­361 of Xl Aurora B (Aurora B60 ­361) and residues 790­847 of Xl INCENP (INCENP790 ­ 847), the so-called IN-box (Figure 4, panel a). The crystallized complex represents an active form of Aurora B (28). Crystals were harvested in mother liquor supplemented with 100 M aminothiazole analogue 25, incubated for 1 h, and rapidly frozen for X-ray diffraction data collection to a resolution of 1.7 Å (Supplemental Table 2). Electron density "difference" maps with phases calculated from the Aurora B60 ­361: INCENP790 ­ 847 complex revealed additional density in the Aurora B ATP-binding pocket (Figure 4, panel b). The density could be fitted unequivocally with an atomic model of the aminothiazole analogue 25 (Figure 4, panel b). Thus, compound 25 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of Aurora kinases. It is of note that an identical binding mode was obtained by molecular docking of 3, the original screening hit, into the published crystal structure of Aurora A (PDB 1mq4) using the docking program GOLD. The aminothiazole ring of derivative 25 is positioned through stacking interactions with the side chains of Ala120, Leu170 (the "gatekeeper" residue), Ala173, Leu99, and Leu223 (Figure 4, panel b). There are hydrogen bonds with main chain atoms on the hinge loop of Aurora B, and in particular the N3 nitrogen acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor for the amide of Ala173 while the amino group that connects the aminothiazole group with the phenyl moiety is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl of Ala173 (Figure 4, panel b). The phenyl ring of the 2-anilino substituent makes a complementary stacking interaction with the side chain of Leu99, while the carboxyamide group is largely exposed to solvent apart from the NH donating a proton to the carbonyl of Leu99

This interaction provides an explanation for the enhanced potency of analogues presenting a hydrogen bond donating group at the aniline 4-position such as an amino (20), aminoacetyl (22), carboxylate (24), and carboxamido (25 and 27). The 5-bromo substituent of aminothiazole 25, is accommodated in a small hydrophobic pocket located adjacent to the gatekeeper residue and is not accessible from the thiazole 4-position, providing an explanation for the lack of activity of compound 3b (Figure 4, panel b).

tracts prepared from Xenopus laevis eggs. These extracts have been extensively used to recapitulate the cell cycle in vitro and are ideal for examining perturbations of spindle assembly. Extracts containing sperm chromosomes were cycled to interphase by addition of Ca2 , and aminothiazole 27 was added at a concentration of 10 M as extracts re-entered mitosis (29). Aminothiazole 27 induced a shortening of mitotic spindles relative to the DMSO-treated controls, as well as partial decondensation of the mitotic chromosomes (Figure 5, panels a and b). Similar results were obtained with Hesperadin (data not shown), and our results are consistent with previous studies showing that inhibition or depletion of Aurora B kinase impairs histone H3 phosphorylation and proper chromosome condensation in mitotic cells (19). Treatment of extracts with aminothiazole 27 resulted in phenotypes more consistent with depletion of Aurora B kinase than with Aurora A kinase (30, 31) and indicate a crucial role for Aurora kinase B activity in maintaining the structure of the mitotic spindle in Xenopus egg extracts.

gous ATP-site interactions formed between the phenylaminothiazole pharmacophore of 25 and the pyrazolopyrimidine moiety of VX-680 may explain the cross reactivity of both compounds with Flt3 in addition to their dominant activity against Aurora kinase. The superposition of these structures provides a wealth of insight into the chemical diversity that can be accommodated within the ATP-cleft of Aurora kinases and provides inspiration for the creation of new "hybrid" compounds (42). In an effort to study the cellular effects of the aminothiazoles, we demonstrated that the compounds can inhibit histone H3 phosphorylation, block the cell cycle in mitosis, and induce endoreduplication consistent with what has been observed in the literature using siRNAs targeting Aurora A and B. Unfortunately, the aminothiazoles we have investigated to date may have limited utility in some experiments because high micromolar concentrations are required to observe cellular effects. We provide evidence that the lack of cellular potency appears to derive from poor cell penetrability

which may be addressable by further chemical optimization. The most interesting feature of the aminothiazole pharmacophore is that it exhibits exceptional selectivity for Aurora kinases based upon extensive profiling in enzymatic and binding assays. This is in contrast to many reported Aurora inhibitors which exhibit significant cross-reactivity with other kinases. In addition, the low molecular weight of aminothiazole 25 makes it an excellent candidate for further chemical optimization. Therefore the aminothiazoles will be useful mechanistic probes for Aurora-dependent phenomena in cell extract systems. The crystal structure of inhibitor 25 in complex with Aurora B: INCENP can be used in conjunction with other reported cocrystal structures to design new analogues with enhanced potency or selectivity between Aurora isoforms. We expect that optimization of the cellular potency and pharmacological properties of the aminothiazoles could lead to new generation of Aurora inhibitors with sufficient selectivity to be used to elucidate the functions of Aurora-mediated phosphorylations in cellular and in vivo models.

METHODS
Synthetic procedures and characterization for all compounds can be found in the Supporting Information. Kinase Screening and IC50 Determination. Kinase activity was performed in 384-well proxiplates using 0.1 g of kinase per well in kinase buffer (50 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT). Compounds were transferred to each well to a final concentration of 10 M and kinase buffer containing 1 M ATP, 10 Ci mL 1 33P -ATP. For IC50 determination the final concentration of 10 M ATP was used. Plates were incubated 1 h at RT before terminating the reaction with 1 M ATP, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mg mL-1 SPA beads (Amersham/pharmacia/GE health) and counted on topcount. Compounds with more than 50% inhibition of kinase activity were retested to determine IC50. Kinase selectivity was determined by profiling leads on 40 different kinases (kinaseprofiler, Upstate). Z=-LYTE Enzymatic Kinase Assay format (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) in the SelectScreen Kinase Profiling Service (Invitrogen Discovery Sciences, Madison, WI). Compounds were assayed at a starting concentration of 30 M, and Km [app] ATP, following the detailed procedures described in the SelectScreen. Customer Protocol and Assay Conditions document located at www.invitrogen.com/kinase profiling. Histone H3 Ser10 Phosphorylation. Fifty thousand HeLa cells plated in 12-well plates were treated with 100 ng mL 1 nocodazole for 20 h prior to 1 h incubation with compound. Cells were lysed in 2 sample buffer. Samples of total cell extracts, equal to one-third of the cells per well, were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-phospho-serine 10 histone H3 (Cell Signaling) to determine phosphorylation state. Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting Analysis. HeLa cells were treated with compound for various periods of time. Cells were trypsinized, washed once in PBS, and fixed for 20 min at 20 °C. Cells were resuspended in PBS, 1 mM EDTA, 100 g mL 1 RNase and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, prior to addition of 10 g mL 1 final concentration of propidium iodide (PI). Cell cycle distribution was determined on Beckman FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed on FlowJo (Treestar). High Throughput Microscopy (HTM). Alternatively cell cycle distribution was quantified using a confocal microscope system with capable of imaging a 384-well plate as follows. Four thousand HeLa cells were plated in each well of a 384-well plate, 24 h later varying concentrations of compounds were added at various times and plates were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Automated acquisition of image from each well was performed and analyzed on an EIDAQ 100 high throughput microscope (Q3DM/ Beckman Coulter). Cell Proliferation Assay. Cells were plated in 96-well plates and subjected to serial dilutions of compound. Forty eight hours later cell viability was measured using CellTiter96 (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Microscopy. Hela cells were plated on coverslips and subjected to various compound treatments 20 h later. Compound treatments were terminated by washing the coverslips twice with PBS and fixing them in 4% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. The coverslips were washed in PBS and subsequently incubated in blocking solution (PBS 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA) for a minimum of 1 h. Coverslips were stained for 1 h with 1:300 anti-phospho-serine 10 histone H3 in blocking solution, 5% BSA, followed by incubation for 1 h 1:1000 anti-rabbit Cy3 in blocking solution. In some cases coverslips were also stained with FITC labeled anti-B-tubulin in blocking solution. Crystallization and Structure Determination. The conditions for expression, purification, and structure determination of Aurora B60 ­361:INCENP790 ­ 847 have been previously described

(28). Crystals obtained by microseeding were gradually transferred in cryo-buffer (19% PEG400, 100 mM Bis-Tris-Propane pH 6.5, 2 mM TCEP), and then incubated with 1/100 (vol/vol) of a 10 mM solution of analogue 25 dissolved in DMSO. After a 1 h incubation with the inhibitor, crystals were flash-frozen. X-ray diffraction data from single crystals were collected at beamline ID14-1 at the European Synchroton Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data processing was carried out with DENZO/ SCALEPACK (43). For subsequent calculations, we used the CCP4 suite (44). Molecular replacement was carried out with MOLREP (45) using the Aurora-B coordinates as search model (PDB ID code 2bfx). Iterative model building was carried out with Coot (46) and Refmac (47) resulting in a good model (Supplemental Table 1). Xenopus Extracts. A solution of compound 27 in water/DMSO (75%/25% by volume) at a concentration of 100 M was prepared. This stock solution was used to deliver compound to the extracts at a final concentration of 10 M. All controls were performed with equal volumes of 25% DMSO solvent. Xenopus laevis extracts were prepared according to Hannak and Heald (29). Cytostatic factor (CSF)-arrested extracts were cycled into interphase by addition of a calcium solution (4 mM CaCl2, 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM MgCl2) and assayed for the presence of intact interphase nuclei after a 1 h incubation. Control solvent or compound 27 was added to the interphase extracts, and entry into mitosis was initiated by adding an equal volume of CSF-arrested extract. Spindle formation occurred within 30 min and was visualized by addition of 0.1 g mL 1 rhodamine-labeled tubulin. Reactions were spun onto coverslips and fixed as previously described (48). Immunostaining was performed using -INCENP antibody at 1:5000 (ABcam). Images were collected using an Olympus fluorescence microscope (model BX51) with a dry 40 objective, a cooled CCD camera (model Orcall, Hamamatsu), and MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices), also used for spindle measurements. Error bars indicate the standard deviation; sample size for control and compound treated spindles is n 33.
