INTRODUCTION The severe diarrhoeal disease cholera is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae and continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Like many Vibrio species V. cholerae inhabits an aquatic ecosystem, and most V. cholerae isolates do not possess the ability to cause cholera. Of more than 200 known serotypes, only O1 and O139 serogroups are highly pathogenic and acknowledged to cause epidemic disease.1 The O1 serogroup can be divided into two groups: classical and El Tor, with the first cholera pandemic, beginning in Asia in 1817, and the subsequent five pandemics probably caused by the classical biotype. The seventh and present pandemic began in 1961 caused by the El Tor biotype.2 In 1992 a novel O-serogroup, O-139, emerged to cause epidemic cholera.3 All V. cholerae O1 and O139 serogroups encode the major virulence factors cholera toxin and toxin coregulated pilus, the latter being encoded on a pathogenicity island, named Vibrio Pathogenicity Island-I (VPI-1).4 Several other genomic regions have been identified that occur mainly among epidemic O1 and O139 serogroup isolates, including the so-called Vibrio seventh pandemic island-I (VSP-I) encoding ORFs VC0175 to VC0185, VSP-II encoding ORFs VC0490 to VC0516 and VPI-2 encoding ORFs VC1758 to VC1809.5­7 A microarray analysis of V. cholerae El Tor isolates was used to identify VSP-I and VSP-II encomC V 2008 WILEY-LISS, INC.

passing genes that are possibly responsible for the unique characteristics of the seventh pandemic (El Tor) strains.5 An evolutionary genetic analysis of clinical and environmental isolates suggested that pandemic strains arose from a common O1 serogroup progenitor through the successive acquisition of new virulence regions.8 VPI-2 is a 57.3 kb region which consists of 52 ORFs present in all toxigenic O1 and O139 serogroup isolates, but lacking in non-O1 and non-O139 nontoxigenic isolates.6 VPI-2 encodes a type-I restriction modification system, a nan-nag region of genes involved in sialic acid metabolism that may play a nutritional role,9 a sialidase/ neuraminidase known to convert intestinal higher-order gangliosides to GM1,10 and a region with homology to Mu phage. In addition, VPI-2 contains several genes that code for hypothetical proteins. One of these proteins, VC1805, is a 148 amino acid protein with no function revealed so far through sequence analysis. VC1805 is also encoded in the reduced 20 kb VPI-2 region present

among most O139 serogroup isolates that are missing ORFs VC1761 to VC1788.6 A paralogue of VC1805 exists within VSP-II, VC0508 a 147 residue protein that shares 59% amino acid sequence identity with VC1805. A search of the sequence database using PSI-BLAST reveals homologues of VC1805 in several Vibrio species: V. vulnificus, V. splendidus, V. alginolyticus and V. fischeri, and orthologues in Altermonas macleodii, Aeromonas hydrophilia, and some Shewanella species. In addition, PSI-BLAST reveals that the adjacent hypothetical protein VC1804, with 104 residues, is a homologue of VC1805 sharing 26% sequence identity. Similarly the hypothetical protein VC0509 is a homologue of the adjacent protein VC0508. The four proteins VC0508, VC0509, VC1804, and VC1805 are therefore likely to share the same protein fold and be functionally related. As part of a structural genomics approach to understanding the function of hypothetical proteins within V. cholerae genomic islands we have determined the crystal ° structure of VC1805 to a resolution of 2.1 A using heavy atom isomorphous replacement. The structure reveals a similarity to the human mitochondrial protein p32 that is known to have several binding partners, including the human complement system protein C1q. This study shows that VC1805 does bind C1q, suggesting potential biological roles for the protein and its homologues. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cloning

by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside) followed by further incubation overnight at 258C. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS buffer containing DNase and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science) and sonicated. Cell lysate was syringe filtered through a 0.22-lm filter unit (Millipore) and VC1805 was purified using a HisTrapTM HP column (GE Healthcare), according to the manufacturer's instruction manual. Protein samples were dialyzed against 3 L of PBS buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 20 mM imidazole, and 0.3M NaCl for 4 h at 48C, with two buffer changes. Next, TEV protease was added into the dialysis tube containing His-tagged protein (1 lg protease for 1 mg protein) at 258C overnight. The digested sample was dialyzed against the same dialysis buffer without EDTA and DTT for 2 h at 48C and the dialysis buffer was changed twice. Protein samples were syringe filtered through a 0.22-lm filter unit (Millipore) and loaded onto the Nickel column as before. The flow-through containing VC1805 was dialyzed against 3 L of PBS buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 20 mM imidazole, and 20 mM NaCl overnight at 48C. After dialysis, the samples were concentrated to 5 mL using a 3000-Da MWCO centrifugal concentrator (Sigma-Aldrich) for further purification by size exclusion on a HiloadTM 26/60 SuperdexTM 200 gel filtration column. Protein purity was analyzed by SDS PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and the correct identity confirmed by mass spectrometry.
Crystallization

The VC1805 gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA of Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor strain N16961 using standard protocols. Forward and reverse primers were 50 -GGAGGCATAAC CATGGCTAACATTTTG and 50 -CTTGATGGAATTCAC TAAGGAGCCGAG with specific recognition sites NcoI and EcoRI. After amplification, the PCR product was digested with NcoI and EcoRI enzymes and cloned into the similarly digested pEHISTEV vector (an engineered variant of pET30 with an N-terminal 63 His tag that is cleavable using Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease, Dr H. Liu, University of St Andrews, personal communication).
Protein expression and purification

A precrystallization test (Hampton Research) indicated the appropriate protein concentration (8 mg/mL) for crystallization screening. Three screens from Hampton research (Index, Crystal Screen 1 and Crystal Screen 2) were used in initial crystallization trials of native VC1805. This experiment was carried out using the sitting drop diffusion method following standard procedure supplied by the manufacturers. Initial hits were optimized through variation of the concentration of salt, precipitant and protein. The best quality crystals were obtained in an optimization of condition 41 of Crystal Screen 1 (0.1M HEPES-Na pH 7.5, 10% v/v 2-propanol, 24% w/v polyethylene glycol 4000).
Structure solution and refinement

The plasmid DNA containing the VC1805 gene was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). A transformed expression host colony was used to inoculate 100 mL LB containing antibiotic kanamycin (50 lg/mL) followed by shaking incubation at 378C overnight. After incubation, a 50-mL culture was used to inoculate 5 L of LB containing kanamycin followed by shaking incubation at 378C for 2­3 h until an OD600 of 0.5­0.6 was reached. At this point, expression of the cloned gene was induced

Crystals were cryoprotected in crystallization buffer with 20% glycerol added before being flash-frozen in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Data, which extended to a ° maximum resolution of 2.13 A, were collected on station ID14-1 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France. The structure was solved by

The wells were then washed four times with PBS 10.1% Tween 20 (Buffer A). The remaining protein binding sites on the wells were saturated with 360 lL of blocking buffer (10% milk in PBS) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature, then wells were washed four times with buffer A. About 100 lL biotinylated anti-human C1q IgG in blocking buffer which contain 5 lg of antibody were added to the wells and incubated at 378C for 1 h. After incubation, washed the wells four times with Buffer A. Streptavidin HRP (horseradish peroxidase, KPL Inc.) was added to the wells and incubated 378C for 1 h, followed by four washes times with buffer A. About 100 lL of TMB peroxide substrate (prepared as per manufacturer's instructions, KPL) was added to the wells and kept at room temperature. As a positive control for C1q binding, wells were coated with hen ovalbumin (as below), then reacted with rabbit-antihen ovalbumin antiserum, to form immune complexes in the wells. C1q was purified from human plasma.20 Rabbit anti-C1q IgG was biotinylated with biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Overall structure

The crystal structure of VC1805 reveals a monomeric protein composed of a flat seven-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet with two helices sitting on the same face of the sheet [Fig. 1(B)]. The first helix (a1) is at the N-terminus, followed by six b-strands (b1 to b6) of varying length that form a simple consecutive up-down topology. The second helix (a2) then stretches back across these six b-strands, leading to a seventh strand (b7) at the Cterminus that completes the sheet. There are four disordered regions where no electron density was observed: the first four residues (1­4), the connection between a1 and b1 (31­39), the loop connecting b3 and b4 (84­86) and the final three residues (146­148). VC1805 has a pI of 4.7 and this is reflected in the negatively-charged surface potential exhibited by the protein [Fig. 1(C)].

Complement consumption assay

NUNC Maxisorp 96-well microtitre plate wells were coated with 100 lL (5 lg) of VC1805 in PBS. As a positive control, wells on the same plate were coated with 100 lL per well of 100 lg/mL hen ovalbumin (Sigma) in 0.1M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The plate was incubated overnight at 48C, then washed four times with buffer A. The remaining sites for protein binding on the plate were saturated by blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature before again washing four times with buffer A. Rabbit anti-ovalbumin antiserum (MRC Immunochemistry Unit) (heat-treated for 30 min at 568C to inactivate rabbit C1q) was diluted 10-fold in PBS and 100 lL added to the ovalbumin-coated wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were washed four times with buffer A. The plates were now ready for the complement consumption assay. Reagent and buffer details were as previously described.20 NHS (normal human serum) was diluted with 1 vol of DGBV11 buffer. The diluted serum (300 lL) was added in triplicate to wells coated with VC1805, ovalbumin anti-ovalbumin and noncoated wells followed by incubation at 378C for 30 min. Serum was removed from wells and kept on ice until ready to assay for total complement haemolytic activity.20 Briefly, serial twofold dilutions of serum were incubated with antibody-sensitised sheep erythrocytes and the degree of lysis determined after 1-h incubation at 378C. The dilution of serum required to give 50% lysis was calculated.

Figure 2 shows a CLUSTAL-W alignment of representative VC1805 homologues and paralogues. All of the proteins listed in Figure 2 carry a negative charge having isoelectric points between 4.3 and 5.4. The V. vulnificus, V. spendidus, V. alginolyticus, and V. fischeri homologues share sequence identities of 65, 60, 47, and 43%, respectively, with VC1805. The Alteromonas macleodii, Aeromonas hydrophilia, and Shewanella orthologues share identities of 38, 36, and 36%, respectively with VC1805. The V. cholerae paralogue VC0508 shares 59% identity with VC1805. Finally the V. cholerae homologue VC1804 and its paralogue VC0509 share 24 and 21% identity respectively with VC1805, while they share 52% identity with each other. There are 10 amino acids that are invariant among this family and these are mapped onto the surface of VC1805 and coloured blue in Figure 1(D). In addition, if VC1804 and VC0509 are excluded, then several other amino acids are conserved which are also mapped onto the surface in green. There appear to be two conserved patches, both carrying a negative potential, on opposite sides of the protein. One patch forms a groove formed between a2 and the loop connecting b1 and b2 with the invariant Tyr50 and His58 coming close in space at one end of the groove [Fig. 1(D), left hand image]. The other patch is centred around another groove on the opposite face that includes a deep hole lined with invariant residues Pro59, Glu61, Phe80 [Fig. 1(D), right hand image]. It is interesting to note that VC1804 would be predicted to be missing the first helix, a region that does not contain any conserved residues.

of VC1805 was submitted to the ProFunc server that revealed a structural homology with human p32 (PDB code 1P32),21 an acidic mitochondrial matrix protein. This protein is an evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic protein originally discovered in association with the nuclear pre-mRNA splicing factor SF2/ASF, although no evidence for a splicing function has been reported.22 Human p32 is a promiscuous protein, reported to bind to many viral proteins,23­28 transcription factor IIB,24 the lamnin B receptor,29 high molecular weight kininogen and factor XII,30 vitronectin,31 hyaluronic acid32 and the globular head domain of the plasma complement component C1q.33 Human p32 is a homotrimer with each chain containing three helices and a seven-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet, and has a pI of 4.34 VC1805 and p32 share 16% sequence identity. The conserved fold

between the two proteins involves the seven-stranded bsheet and the helix (a2) that straddles the sheet, although the connectivity is slightly different (see Fig. 3). ° The rmsd fit between VC1805 and p32 is 2.51 A over 70 35 Human p32 has two long helices Ca atoms using SSM. at its N- and C-termini that are involved in the association with other monomers in the p32 trimer. The first bstrand after the N-terminal helix of p32 is in the same location as b7 in VC1805, but from then on the topology is the same for both proteins until the structurally conserved helix (a2) which in p32 is slightly shorter and turns 908 to form the C-terminal helix that associates with the long N-terminal helix. As noted above, in VC1805 the final strand of the sheet (b7) follows helix a2. Although p32 has a low pI, the charge distribution is asymmetric with one face of the p32 trimer carrying a

patches conserved within the VC1805 family are not conserved in p32. Conversely the two regions conserved among the eukaryotic homologues of p32 are not conserved in VC1805.34 The only homologous structure to p32 in the protein databank is that of a hypothetical protein LMAJ011689 from Leishmania major (PDB code 1YQF) that although it shares only 16% sequence identity with human p32, it also has a low pI of 4.5, and possesses the same trimeric structure as p32 with monomers having an RMSD fit of ° 1.64 A over 155 Ca atoms using SSM.35 The p32 fold is therefore an unusual fold in the current protein databank, so the fact that VC1805 shares the same core fold of a helix straddling a seven-stranded anti-parallel bsheet, and also has a dominant negative charge potential, suggests that the proteins may have a related function.

pandemic isolates, suggests that these proteins must have a role that gives an advantage to those strains of V. cholerae possessing them. What about the other Vibrio sp. and g-Proteobacteria that have homologues of VC1805? V. vulnificus is a marine pathogen and etiologic agent of human mortality from seafood-borne infections. V. spendidus and V. alginolyticus are pathogens of certain shellfish, including oysters and clams. V. fischeri is a nonpathogenic beneficial marine species that enters into a mutualistic symbiosis in the light organ of the bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes. Alteromonas macleodii and Shewanella sp. W3-18-1 are deep sea marine bacteria. Aeromonas hydrophilia is found in all freshwater environments and brackish water, and is a pathogen of fish and amphibians that can also cause disease in humans. Of the many reported binding partners of p32, the binding to the head domain of the complement component C1q appeared worthy of exploration. V. cholerae is generally accepted to be a noninvasive gut pathogen, and thought to be relatively non-inflammatory36,37 although a more recent report described an inflammatory response in both O1 and O139 cholera infections.38 Could VC1805 therefore be engaging C1q as part of a strategy to modify complement attack, or to mediate cell adhesion? C1q bound to VC1805 immobilised on microtitre plate wells [Fig. 4(A)]. Immobilised VC1805 also caused complement consumption when incubated with human serum [Fig. 4(B)], indicating that VC1805 binds C1 and activates the complement classical pathway. Complement consumption by VC1805 was at a similar level (25­30%) to consumption by immune complexes. C1, a complex of C1q with the serine protease proenzymes C1r and C1s, is the form in which C1q circulates in blood. There was no consistent dose-dependent complement inhibitory effect when soluble VC1805 was added to serum (data not shown). This is consistent with the requirement for multivalent binding of C1q to a target array to initiate complement activation. Thus soluble VC1805, which is a monomer in solution, may bind weakly to sites on the C1q globular heads, but engagement of two or more heads of C1q, and summation of multiple weak interactions, as can occur with an array of immobilized VC1805, is required for high avidity C1q binding and complement activation. It would not be advantageous for V. cholerae to have a protein that would activate complement, but this would be consistent with V. cholerae being non-invasive. It is not known if VC1805 is secreted, and if so whether it remains attached to the bacterial surface. What therefore could be the relevance of binding to C1q? It is known that some other complement-related components (DAFCD55 and MCP-CD46) serve as anchors for gut microbes, but DAF and MCP are cell-surface proteins, not soluble like C1q. C1q is synthesized in gut epithelial cells39,40 and may be present in the gut lumen, although this has been shown only in inflammatory bowel dis-

ease.41 C1q can associate with membranes via C1q receptors which bind the collagenous region of C1q. The identification of C1q receptors has been controversial, but it is now widely accepted that Calreticulin, bound to cell surfaces via CD91, HLA class 1 heavy chain, or CD59, acts as a receptor for C1q and the related ``defence collagens'' SPA, SPD and MBL.42­44 C1q receptor activity is present on lung epithelial cells,45 but it does not appear to have been investigated in gut epithelium. Perhaps a role for VC1805 is to aid in cell adhesion and to act as a bridge between membrane immobilized C1q and some ligand on the bacterial surface - this may be consistent with the two conserved surface patches on opposite sides of VC1805.

CONCLUSIONS The structure of VC1805 has an unusual topology with only two structural homologues in the current protein databank: human p32 and a hypothetical protein from Leishmania major. The four homologues/paralogues VC0508, VC0509, VC1804, and VC1805 in the V. cholerae genome of toxigenic strains are predicted to share the same fold, and all carry a predominantly negative charge, something they also share with human p32. The mitochondrial p32 protein binds to a variety of ligands, and we have chosen to focus on just one of the reported binding partners of human p32, showing that VC1805 does bind to the complement protein C1q. If this is relevant in vivo, then one possible role of VC1805 might be to aid adherence of the bacteria to the intestinal wall via C1q bound to C1q receptors. C1q can bind a remarkable variety of immune and non-immune ligands through charge pattern recognition mediated mainly through its globular head domain.46 The crystal structure of the globular head domain of human C1q revealed the details of the heterotrimeric organization of the three chains each with similar jelly-roll topology.47 The three modules within the C1q head domain show clear differences in their electrostatic surface potentials, with one module carrying a predominantly positive charge that has been implicated in the C1q-IgG interaction.47 However, the details of the interactions between C1q and its various ligands remain to be elucidated.45 It may be fortuitous that VC1805, being negatively charged, happens to be able to bind to C1q in vitro, and this may be completely unrelated to its biological function in vivo. Human p32 also binds to hyaluronic acid, a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan found in the extracellular matrix of epithelial tissues. Perhaps hyaluronic acid is the ligand recognized by VC1805. This structural study on VC1805 has stimulated further investigations that will focus on quantifying the interaction with C1q, carrying out pull-down experiments to identify other binding partner(s) of VC1805,
