Received November 18, 1980; accepted in revised form March 30, 1981 Polyspecific xenoantisera specific for embryonic chick liver cells have been used to develop an assay for the detection of embryonic chick liver adhesion molecules (LAM). The neutralization of the antiaggregation immune sera and subsequent semiquantitative assessment of the remaining activity is the basis for this assay. Embryonic chick liver membrane proteins have been solubilized using a number of detergents and the LAM activity has been partially purified using sucrose-gradient sedimentation, isoelectric focusing, gel filtration, affinity chromatography, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis procedures. The isolated LAM appears to be an intrinsic, trypsin-resistant, membrane glycoprotein of approximately 65,000 daltons. The 65K preparation of LAM is an effective immunogen in generating an aggregation blocking xenoantiserum specific for embryonic chick liver cells. Purification of LAM to homogeneity has been hampered by an apparent lability by self-association or loss by adsorption of the more purified LAM antigen(s).

is presented that LAM is an intrinsic membrane glycoprotein that may mediate organ-selective in vitro Several models have been proposed to explain the molecular basis of cell-cell adhesion (Moscona, 1974; chick liver cell-cell reaggregation and cell adhesion.

Rabbits were bled to obtain preimmune sera and were then injected three times at 2-week intervals with dissociated cells (McGuire and Burdick, 1976), and bled 10 days after the third injection. Subsequently, rabbits were injected at 3-week intervals and bled 10 days after each injection. Serum with anti-chick liver (ACL)' activity was made by injecting lo7 dissociated g-day chick liver cells in 1 ml PBS intravenously. Sera were stored at -2O", and, before use, were heated to 56" for 40 min to destroy the rabbit complement system. The antisera contained immunoglobulins specific for antigens on the surface of embryonic chick liver cells. When chick liver cells were incubated with heated liver antisera, the cells remained viable as judged by trypan blue exclusion, but did not aggregate. Purified IgG, F(ab)`z, and Fab' from liver antiserum also bound to and prevented cell aggregation. This report describes the use of both whole antisera and purified IgG for the assay of LAM during the isolation of membrane antigen targets derived from aggregating embryonic chick liver cells. Preparation of antisera using LAM fractions. Antiserum was also prepared using partially purified LAM as the immunogen. The DOC/S-200 fraction (100-200 pg/injection) was emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) and injected sub-

cutaneously into a rabbit at 2-week intervals. Following the third injection the rabbit was bled and the serum tested for anti-liver aggregation activity. Following the fourth injection all subsequent injections were administered intramuscularly in incomplete Freunds adjuvant. This antiserum is designated anti-S-200. Antisera to more purified membrane fractions were * prepared as follows: DOC supernatant was fractionated using preparative sucrose gradients (5-10%). The fractions were assayed and LAM-positive fractions were pooled and further purified using preparative 7% slab SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the modified Laemmli buffer systems described below. The sample was applied in a lo-cm slot with dansylated standards (phosphorylase B, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and aldolase) run on either edge. The gel was run at 4 V/cm for 16-20 hr. The dansylated standards were located using an ultraviolet lamp. Two slices were cut from the gel as indicated in Fig. 5. Each contained one of the two major iodinated proteins in the sucrose-gradient fraction (65,000 and 48,000 daltons). The polyacrylamide slices (gl ml) were homogenized with 1 ml sterile PBS and then emulsified in 2 ml CFA. One rabbit was injected intramuscularly with the 7555K fraction and another with the 55-45K fraction. This procedure was repeated at biweekly intervals. The rabbits were bled 1 week following injection starting with the second immunization. The antisera are designated anti-65K and anti-48K. At a later time, the 52-58K region was used as an immunogen and rabbit anti-55K serum was prepared using the same procedures. Fractionation of antisera. Immunoglobulins were purified from whole serum by precipitation with 50% (NH&SO, followed by column chromatography over DE-52 cellulose in 0.0175 M phosphate buffer pH 7. The first peak of protein was pooled and concentrated using an Amicon Diaflo apparatus with a UM-10 membrane. This fraction contains immunoglobulin G. The IgG fraction was incubated in 0.1 M acetate buffer pH 4.1 with 2% pepsin (w/w) overnight at 37°C. Upon chromatography over Sephadex G-150 in PBS, the F(ab)`, fraction eluted near the void volume. After concentration and dialysis against 0.55 M Tris buffer pH 8, the F(ab)`z was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr with 0.1 M 2mercaptoethanol. Iodoacetamide was then added to a final concentration of 0.2 M and the solution incubated for 30 min on ice. The excess 2-mercaptoethanol and iodoacetamide were removed by dialysis against PBS. This fraction contains Fab' fragments. Preparation of membrane and solubilized membrane. Fertile eggs purchased from Great Western Poultry, Inc., Greeley, Colorado, were incubated in a Humidaire incubator. Livers were dissected from embryos on the designated day of development, washed in medium H,

and broken into small chunks with a forceps. Approximately 60 livers from g-day embryos (2 g wet wt tissue) were homogenized in 3 ml medium H containing 1 m&f PMSF in a tight-fitting Dounce tissue grinder. Cell lysis was determined by microscopic observation. The homogenate was diluted to 10 ml with medium H and any remaining intact cells, erythrocytes, and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 15Ogfor 5 min. The nuclear pellet was washed by suspension in 10 ml H medium and centrifugation at 150g for 5 min. The supernatants were pooled and a pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 30,OOOg 1 hr in a Sorvall SS-34 for rotor at 4°C. The whole membrane pellet was either used directly or suspended in a small volume of medium H + 1 mM PMSF for storage at -70". After storage, the whole membrane was recentrifuged to remove it from PMSF. Membrane protein solubilization using detergents was achieved using the methods of Helenius and Simons (1975). The whole membrane pellet was suspended in 10 rnM Tris, pH 8.0, containing 2% (w/v) recrystallized sodium deoxycholate (DOC) and 1 mM PMSF at a concentration of approximately 20 mg protein/ml for 20 min at 37°C. The DOC mixture was centrifuged at 180,000~for 1 hr in a Spinco 50 Ti rotor at 10°C. A clear, yellow-brown supernatant containing about 50% of the membrane protein was carefully removed from under the lipid layer using a Pasteur pipet. This supernatant, designated DOC-soluble whole membrane, contained LAM activity while the pellet and lipid layer were devoid of activity. In some experiments cell membrane was obtained from dissociated liver cells. Embryonic liver was dissociated with trypsin, collagenase, and chick serum (CTC) by the procedure reported previously (McGuire and Burdick, 1976) and membrane prepared from the cells by the procedure outlined above for whole liver. The yield of membrane protein from dissociated liver cells was about lo-15% of that from whole liver and is subsequently designated cell membrane. In other experiments, whole membrane from liver was digested with CTC before detergent solubilization. The membrane pellet from 100 livers was suspended in 2 ml medium H. The suspension was mixed with 5 ml CTC and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The digestion was stopped by adding 15 ml HNCS and the membranes were sedimented by centrifugation at 30,OOOg 1 hr. for This fraction is called CTC membrane. Approximately 50% of the whole membrane protein was removed by CTC digestion. The CTC membrane pellet was solubilized in DOC by the same method outlined above. Detergent removal. Other detergents including SDS, Triton X-100, NP-40, Brij 96, Tween 20, and Tween 80, have also been used to solubilize liver membrane. How-

ever, these detergents were not as readily adsorbed with BSA in the antigen assay described below. Removal of detergent by dialysis (where applicable) or SM-2 bead extraction caused precipitation of solubilized material. In some cases, addition of DOC after removal of detergent would resolubilize the membrane material, however, to avoid loss of antigen activity by excessive manipulation self-aggregation, or permanent denaturation, it was found that direct solubilization in DOC was the most efficient procedure. Detergent can also be removed from solubilized membrane fractions or purified LAM preparations by precipitating the protein in 3 vol of cold EtOH (Snary et al., 1974). This procedure is also effective for concentrating LAM preparations. Protein is collected by centrifugation and the detergent remains in solution. The pellet is then redissolved in 10 miV Tris, pH 8.0, 1% DOC, and 1 mM PMSF. Assay fbr membrane-specific antigens involved in liver cell-cell adhesion. An assay similar to that reported by Beug et al. (1970) and Rutishauser et al. (1976), for detecting membrane antigens involved in cell-cell adhesions, has been developed. Liver antiserum was preincubated with embryonic chick liver membrane or solubilized membrane components for 3 hr at 4°C on a tube rotator set at 25 rpm. The volume of the mixture was 0.2-0.4 ml containing 0.05 ml antiserum, membrane, or solubilized membrane and PBS at pH 7.5. Maximum antigen activity was observed if the mixture also contained 0.5% DOC. After preincubation, 0.2 ml of 30% (w/v) BSA in PBS, pH 7.5, was added and the mixture incubated at 37°C for 10 min to inactivate DOC by complexing with BSA. The mixture was cooled to 4°C and lo6 freshly dissociated embryonic chick liver cells in 0.05 ml medium H were added. The cell suspension was incubated on the tube rotator at 4°C for 1 hr. The suspension was then diluted with 3 ml HNCS, transferred to a 25-ml Delong flask and rotated at 66 rpm in a New Brunswick rotary shaker at 37°C. Cell aggregation was recorded after 15 min. Specific immune antisera prevents aggregation of liver cells. The addition of LAM allows aggregation by complexing with the antibodies. Thus measuring aggregation in the presence of blocked antibody is the basis of the assay for LAM (see Results). Collecting aggregate assag. The assay of McGuire and Burdick (1976) was used with the following modifications. Minced 8-day embryonic chick livers were labeled (by incubation at 30°C for approximately 3 hr) in 3 ml HNCS medium containing 150 &i [3H]leucine and neutralized with 0.1 N NaOH. The labeled tissue was dissociated by the same procedure used for cells for aggregate preparation (McGuire and Burdick, 1976). After dissociation, 3 X lo6 labeled cells were incubated in 12

`75-mm plastic tubes on a New Brunswick Model TC5 tube rotator at 4°C for 1 hr at 25 rpm with antiserum or preimmune serum in medium H as indicated. These cells were then diluted with HNCS medium and 2 X lo4 cells were used per flask with three aggregates. The serum incubation procedure does not affect the viability of the labeled cells as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Fractionation procedures. For gel filtration at room temperature, Sephacryl S-200 superfine was equilibrated with 1% (w/v) DOC in 10 mM Tris, pH 8. Columns (2.5 X 42 cm) were prepared containing a bed volume of about 200 ml. DOC-solubilized membrane (2-3 ml) samples were applied by adding a drop of glycerol and layering on top of the S-200 under the column buffer with a Pasteur pipet. Equal volume fractions were collected by drop counting. Analytical sucrose-gradient centrifugation was carried out according to the procedure of Martin and Ames (1961) as adopted by Snary et al. (1974). Linear gradients from 28 to 9% (w/v) sucrose in 1% (w/v) DOC, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 mM Tris, pH 8.2, were prepared with a two-chamber gradient maker. DOC-solubilized membrane samples (1 ml) were layered onto 11-ml gradients and centrifuged in a Spinco SW41 rotor at 38,000 rpm for 45 hr. Equal-volume fractions were collected by pumping the gradient from the bottom of the tube and counting drops. Preparative sucrose gradients were run in a 5 to 10% linear gradient in the above buffers using the SW41 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 40 hr. Polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis was performed using a gel system similar to that described by Laemmli (1970). The running gel (22 ml, 1.4 mm thick) contained 7.0% acrylamide, 0.186%N,N'-bisacrylamide, 0.375 M Tris, pH 8.8, and 0.1% SDS. The stacking gel (1.4 mm thick) contained 4% acrylamide, 0.21% bisacrylamide, 0.125 M Tris, pH 6.8, and 0.1% SDS. Gels were stained with 0.05 ml Coomassie brilliant blue. Dried gels were exposed to presensitized Kodak XR-1 X-ray film at -70°C in the presence of a DuPont Cronex Lightning-Plus film enhancer to obtain radioautographs. Preparative flat-bed electrofocusing was carried out according to procedures provided by the manufacturer. The major modification was to perform the electrofocusing in the presence of Triton X-100 to maintain solubility of the protein samples. Triton-soluble membrane containing 60-100 mg protein was focused at 8 W overnight at room temperature. The gel was separated into 30 fractions using the LKB fractionating grid and the pH of each fraction determined using a small, surface electrode. Protein was eluted from the gel fractions by transferring them to small columns and washing with 0.5 ml Triton X-100 in PBS containing 0.1 n&f

PMSF. "Ampholine" and detergent were removed from small aliquots of the eluates by dialysis against PBS, 0.1 mM PMSF in tubing containing SM-2 beads. DOC was added for assays to locate LAM activity. Detergent and Ampholine were then removed from larger aliquots of the eluates containing LAM by gel filtration on S-200. Preparation of a#inity columns. Affinity columns were prepared by binding lentil lectin or whole membrane DOC supernatant protein to cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose 6B using the method of Cuatrecasas (1970). Lentil lectin was prepared by the method of Howard et al. (1971). The lentil lectin affinity column contained 2.85 mg protein/ml Sepharose 6B. The whole membrane DOC supernatant affinity column contained approximately 1 mg protein/ml Sepharose 6B. Iodination of protein. Proteins were labeled with `%I using a chloramine-T procedure similar to that of Greenwood et al. (1963) at room temperature. Samples containing 0.1 mg protein in 0.01 ml buffer were mixed with 0.5 to 1 mCi carrier-free Na'?. Then 0.01 ml chloramine-T (1 mg/ml in 0.3 M Na-phosphate, pH 7.4) was added for 2 min. The reaction was stopped with 0.01 ml sodium metabisulfite (1 mg/ml in 0.3 M Na-phosphate, pH 7.4). Carrier protein (2 ml of 1 mg/ml BSA) was added and the mixture dialyzed against PBS to remove free 1251. Efficiency of protein labeling was determined by TCA precipitability of radioactivity. Immune precipitation of LAM. Partially purified LAM was labeled with `%I as previously described and preincubated with heated preimmune rabbit serum for 1 hr at 37°C followed by an equal volume of 10% (w/ v) Formalin-killed Staph A. The nonspecific immune complexes were discarded. Immune rabbit serum was added followed by Formalin-killed Staph A. Staph A containing specific LAM immune complexes were collected by centrifugation. For electrophoresis the Staph A was suspended in a volume of sample buffer equal to the pellet volume and incubated at 37°C for 2.5 hr followed by 30 min in a boiling water bath. The Staph A was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant used directly for electrophoresis. Active LAM antigen was removed from Staph A by eluting the immune complex in 2 vol of IN acetic acid for 3 hr at 37°C. The Staph A was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant neutralized with 10 N NaOH. The suspension was adjusted to 10 mMTris, pH 8, and 10% DOC was added to 0.5% final concentration. Antibody was removed from the mixture by adding an equal volume of packed DOC-soluble membrane Sepharose 6B affinity material and incubating at 4°C for 3 hr. The Sepharose containing bound antibody was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was as-

The detergents used in this study were found to interfere with standard protein determination methods. Therefore, protein concentration was estimated from its absorbance at 280 and 260 nm when measured against appropriate blanks containing the same concentration of detergent as the sample. Detergent lots were prescreened for low 280/260 readings. Membrane samples containing no detergent were dissolved in 1% SDS for estimation of protein. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis was carried out according to the procedure described by Weeke (1973) with a modified Tris-

barbiturate, pH 8.6, buffer system. The buffer contained Tris base, 44.3 g; barbital, 22.4 g; calcium lactate, 0.533 g; and sodium azide, 1 g/liter. Electrophoresis was carried out using a 7.5 X 5.0-cm slide layered with 1.2% agarose at 8 V/cm for 30 min and at 12 V/cm for 120 min in the second direction. The slides were washed, stained, and dried as described by Weeke (1973).

diagram of the liver membrane solubilizations and the various steps utilized to purify LAM. The specific activity of LAM is the same in whole membrane and DOCsoluble whole membrane from 9-, 12-, and 15-day embryonic liver. Membrane from 9- or 12-day livers was used for most purification studies. Cell membrane from CTC dissociated g-day liver cells had a fivefold lower specific activity than whole liver membrane, while CTC digestion of whole liver membranes doubled the specific activity by removal of non-LAM proteins (see Fig. 2). Solubilization of the membranes in deoxycholate or Triton X-100 resulted in 100% recovery of LAM with approximately a twofold increase in specific activity. Estimation of Molecular Weight of LAM LAM activity was detected in fractions obtained by centrifugation of DOC-soluble membrane through sucrose-density gradients. Figure 3 shows the peak of LAM activity was at a position in the gradient indicating a sz, value slightly less than BSA. From a plot vs of s20,w migration of standard proteins in the sucrose gradient, the s20,W value for LAM was estimated to be 3.5 and the molecular weight approximately 50,000 daltons.

shown to be both organ and species selective as reported by McGuire (1976). Rabbit antiserum directed against embryonic chick liver cells (ACL) inhibits aggregation (Fig. 1). This activity is specific for embryonic chick liver cells, having no effect on the aggregation of embryonic chick neural retina and brain cells, or embryonic mouse and rat liver cells. Table 1 shows the effect of the IgG, F(ab)`, and Fab' fractions of ACL antisera. Preincubation of liver antiserum with solubilized liver membranes will neutralize the inhibition of aggregation (Fig. 1); antibodies in the serum are complexed by antigens in the solubilized membrane making them unavailable to block cell-cell adhesion. To prevent detergent lysis of the liver cells in the assay, bovine serum albumin was added or detergent removed by procedures designated under Materials and Methods. Although ACL sera have antibodies directed toward many different surface antigens only antigens which neutralize the antiaggregation activity are assayed by this method (data not shown). Inhibition of liver cell adhesion by ACL serum and the reversal of this inhibition by LAM can also be measured quantitatively by the kinetic cell-aggregate adhesion assay. Results shown in Table 2 confirm the validity of the simpler semiquantitative assay shown in Fig. 1. Routine screening was carried out using the simpler semiquantitative "size of aggregates" assay. Periodically, results were checked with the more quantitative cell-aggregate assay. Isolation of LAM Purification of antigens present in crude plasma membrane and detergent-solubilized membrane fractions was based on the amount of protein necessary to complex with and prevent the antiaggregation effect of the minimum amount of ACL serum which completely inhibited reaggregation of lo6 chick liver cells (see Fig. 1). Each antiserum was titered for antiaggregation activity; the minimum volume giving complete blocking (a 0 effect) was utilized. Figure 2 shows a flow

Calibration of the Sephacryl S-200 column using the soluble proteins indicated in Fig. 4 gave a molecular weight for LAM of approximately 60,000 daltons in reasonable agreement with the estimate obtained using sucrose-gradient centrifugation. However, the use of soluble protein markers in the presence of detergents make these values suspect, as suggested by Tanford et al. (1974). As with sucrose-gradient velocity determinations, LAM appears to be slightly smaller than bovine serum albumin (MW = 68,000).

Figure 4 shows the results of gel filtration of DOCsoluble membrane proteins on S-200. The elution position of LAM activity was only slightly affected by CTC treatment of cells or membrane; however, it is clear that other proteins were drastically reduced in size. These results suggest that LAM was resistant to proteolytic digestion during incubation in the trypsincollagenase mixture while many other membrane proteins were degraded. Greater purification was achieved following gel-filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 from DOCsolubilized cell membrane and CTC membrane than from whole membrane (see Fig. 4). The greatest yield of LAM was obtained from CTC membrane. Overall, approximately lo- to 20-fold purification was achieved. In order to obtain larger amounts of purified LAM, preparative electrofocusing was run on Triton X-lOOsolubilized 12-day whole liver membrane as described under Materials and Methods. LAM was detected in several fractions at pH values of approximately 4.8 to 5.3. Fractions containing LAM were pooled and frac-

FIG. 5. Lentil lectin-affinity chromatography of LAM. A column (0.9 X 15 cm) was packed with lentil lectin Sepharose 6B (2.85 mg/ ml) in 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100,0.05 M Tris buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.0007 M CaCl*, MnC12, and MgCl*. 2.5 mg Triton X-NO-solubilized whole membrane LAM was applied to the column and 1.8-ml fractions were collected until the absorbance at 280 nm (0) was negligible. LAM was eluted with 0.1 M a-methylmannoside (indicated by the arrow) in the above buffer. 200-al aliquots of each fraction were treated with SM-2 beads to remove detergent and were then tested using the antibody reversal assay for LAM activity (0).

indicating that lipid was not necessary for activity. No activity was associated with the lipid or aqueous-soluble fractions. Pooled S-200 fractions containing LAM activity were incubated with CM-cellulose-bound S. griseus protease for 19 hr at 37°C. Control incubations contained an equivalent amount of CM-cellulose. After removal of CM-cellulose and bound protease by centrifugation, the protease-digested samples had no active LAM, whereas the control showed nearly all its original activity. Periodate treatment of LAM had no effect on activity, indicating that oxidizable carbohydrate was unnecessary for activity as an antigen. Treatment of whole membrane with V. cholerae neuraminidase (50 units for 1 hr) released 100 nmole of sialic acid/mg protein but did not inactivate LAM activity, providing additional evidence that sialic acid is not involved in LAM antigenicity. LAM S-200 fraction will also retain antigenic activity after treatment with SDS, mercaptoethanol, urea, persulfate, and heating as used in electrophoresis. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis

Binding of LAM to Lentil Lectin During purification of LAM, its binding to lentil lectin was examined. Figure 5 shows the results of lectin-affinity column separation of crude Triton X-lOO-solubilized whole membrane. A large amount of uv-absorbing material, containing no detectable LAM, did not bind to the affinity column. LAM was detected in the small amount of material eluted by 0.1 Ma-methylmannoside suggesting that it is a glycoprotein. LAM did not bind to Sepharose 6B which had been activated by cyanogen bromide, but not coupled to lectin. Although approximately 25-fold purification was accomplished by lectin affinity chromatography, the yield was less than 25% and activity was lost when the lectinpurified LAM was passed through a Sephacryl S-200 column. The use of lectin-affinity chromatography as a routine purification procedure for LAM awaits a better understanding of the loss of LAM activity. Other Properties of LAM Samples of DOC-soluble membrane could be heated for 10 min in boiling water bath without loss of LAM activity. Thus, if LAM was denatured by boiling, it was still active as an antigen. Extraction of samples with chloroform-methanol (2/l, v/v) showed that LAM activity remained with the insoluble protein at the organic/aqueous interface. This protein can be resolubilized in Tris/DOC and LAM activity demonstrated,

Samples of various membrane fractions containing LAM activity were analyzed by polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis. Figure 6 shows that digestion of whole liver membrane with CTC seems to eliminate a number of bands visualized by Coomassie staining. There is also an apparent loss in total protein caused by CTC digestion. After S-200 fractionation of DOC-soluble membrane, the Coomassie staining material seems to be confined to a few major bands.

amount of 65K material (less than 1%). Active LAM was demonstrated to be present in the ACL-LAM immune complex by dissociation of the Staph A-bound complexes and removal of antibody by passage over an affinity column containing immobilized LAM antigen (whole membrane DOC supernatant). The LAM formerly bound in the ACL-LAM immune complexes was then assayed in the standard fashion. Lane 4 represents a fraction of LAM prepared by passive elution of a preparative electrophoresis gel. This material contains active LAM, but also contains chicken serum albumin (CSA), which cannot be resolved by this technique. Crossed Immunoelectrophoresis Figure 8 shows a radioautograph of the iodinated 65K electrophoresis fraction after crossed immunoelectrophoresis on an agarose slide containing anti-65K serum. The major iodinated peak (solid arrow) has been shown to be CSA. However, CSA is not equivalent to LAM, since it is easily removed during the use of lentil lectinaffinity chromatography. We believe the large anodic immune precipitate peak to be LAM. This would be consistent with the acidic isoelectric value (pH 4.8 to 5.3).
DISCUSSION

autoradiograph of a sample of S-200 LAM activity peak labeled with 1251 chloramine-T procedure. The prinby ciple labeled materials run at positions equivalent to molecular weights of 65K, 55K, 48K, and material of a molecular weight less than 25K. Attempts to electroelute or passively elute LAM from electrophoresis gels have met with limited success. An active fraction has been prepared from the 65K region of the gel, however, very low recoveries (5%) were obtained. Combining fractions did not aid in recovering antigenic activity. Preparation of LAM Antisera

Rabbit antiserum was prepared using the DOC-S-200 fraction of LAM which was active in blocking embryonic chick cell aggregation. Active antisera was also prepared using polyacrylamide fractions from preparative electrophoresis as described under Materials and Methods. The gels were sliced as shown in Fig. 6. Table 3 gives the values for the antiaggregation titer of these sera. The fraction encompassing the 75-55K region (anti-65K) was the most immunogenic as shown by the high titer of this antisera. The anti-55K serum was totally inactive, while the serum obtained after injection of the 55-45K (anti-48K) region of the electrophoresis was marginally active. Immune Precipitation of LAM

ACL antiserum, prepared by injecting embryonic chick liver cells into rabbits, blocks aggregation in a tissue- and species-specific manner. The relative organ and species specificity of this and other antiaggregation antisera (unpublished data) directly parallel the specificity of cell-cell and cell-aggregate adhesion previously reported (McGuire, 1976; McGuire and Burdick, 19'76; Roth and Weston, 1967; obrink et aZ., 1977). In addition, other highly cytotoxic antisera have no effect on cell-cell aggregation (unpublished data). These se12 34

lective effects of aggregation-blocking antisera argue against the notion that the inhibition is simply a result of steric hindrance (Boyse et aZ., 1968) or crosslinking of antigens unrelated to adhesion resulting in surface modulation (Edelman et aZ.,1973; Yahara and Edelman, 1975). This provides strong evidence that blocking is achieved by direct binding of the antibodies to a specific subset of cell surface antigens, presumptive liver adhesion molecules (LAM). In this report, ACL antiserum was used in an assay for the purification of LAM from embryonic chick liver plasma membrane. Solubilized LAM will complex with the aggregation-blocking antibodies present in ACL serum and allow aggregation to occur. The degree of reversal of the antibody blocking of aggregation is directly proportional to the amount of LAM used to neutralize the antibody (Fig. 1). This fact has been utilized to roughly quantitate LAM during its solubilization and purification. LAM was purified lo- to 25fold, but attempts to further purify led to loss of activity in the assay. The reason for loss of activity has not been determined although it seems highly probable this loss can be accounted for by adsorbtion. LAM in crude antigen mixtures seemed stable to various denaturing conditions (heat, lipid extraction by organic solvents, and periodate oxidation) and mild tryptic digestion. However, prolonged digestion with S. griseus protease destroyed its ability to bind antibody. Since LAM bound to lentil lectin-affinity columns, it appears to be a glycoprotein. The partially purified antigen showed a few major bands of Coomassie staining protein by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Active LAM has been demonstrated to be associated with the 65K region of the gel by elution, albeit in low yield. Use of the 65K region of the gel as an immunogen has yielded an ex-

cellent antisera which blocks embryonic chick liver cell aggregation while having no effect on chick neural retina cells or embryonic mouse liver cells. This is the most convincing evidence that the 65K band is at least in part LAM. Antisera which block embryonic chick liver aggregation also immunoprecipitate 65K material. We have demonstrated that the precipitated immune complexes contain antigenically active LAM. However, LAM is not the only protein present in the 65K band. The experiment using crossed immunoelectrophoresis, shown in Fig. 8, demonstrates that chicken serum albumin (CSA) is also present. Chicken serum albumin (CSA) is not LAM as demonstrated by the following facts: (1) added CSA does not reverse the antiaggregation effect of antisera; (2) rabbit anti-CSA does not inhibit chick liver cell aggregation; and (3) CSA and LAM can be separated on a lentil lectin-affinity column. CSA is not a glycoprotein and is not retained while LAM binds to the column (see Fig. 5). The low antiliver aggregation activity of the 48K region probably results from proteolytic cleavage of the 65K band. We have partially converted electrophoresis-eluted 65K to 48K band by incubation in the presence of liver homogenates (data not shown), suggesting endogenous proteases carry out this proteolytic cleavage. Hence, 48K band may be antigenically related to 65K. The behavior of LAM on S-200 gel-filtration columns and sucrose-density gradient sedimentation was used to estimate its molecular weight. Both techniques indicated a molecular weight of approximately 60,000 daltons. It should be observed that proteins do not elute as expected from S-200 in DOC. The elution volume for each of the standard proteins was much less in DOC than without detergent, i.e., their apparent size was increased. However, the standard proteins still parti-

tioned according to their relative size and a reasonable standard curve was obtained. This is in agreement with the 65K estimate obtained from SDS-gel analyses. Cells obtained by CTC dissociation of embryonic chick liver appear to have LAM which is identical to LAM obtained from whole liver. LAM from whole liver membranes which had been digested with CTC also appeared to be unaltered. It cannot be determined if LAM is altered by solubilization, however, detergent-treated LAM is still active as antigen in complexing antibody which specifically inhibits cell-cell adhesion. Isolated LAM, by itself, has no stimulatory or inhibiting effect on liver cell adhesion. A number of reports from other laboratories have presented evidence for the purification of cell surfaceadhesion molecules. "Cognin" has been purified from chick neural retina cells (Hausman and Moscona, 1979; Hausman et aZ.,1976). This 50,000-dalton protein binds to neural cells and promotes the aggregation of these cells. "CAM" (cell adhesion molecule), a 140,000-dalton protein also isolated from chick neural retina cells, does not directly effect aggregation of neural cells, but will complex Fab' fragments which block such aggregation (Rutishauser et a!., 1976; Brackenbury et al, 19'77; Thiery et aZ., 1977). Ligatin, a lO,OOO-dalton protein, again solubilized from chick neural membranes, will directly block aggregation of neural cells. This molecule is thought to function as a baseplate for additional celladhesion proteins (Jakoi and Marchase, 1979). Cs-A (contact sites A), an 80,000-dalton developmentally regulated glycoprotein, has been isolated from DictyosteZium discoideum as a target for an aggregation-blocking Fab preparation (Huesgen and Gerisch, 1975; Muller and Gerisch, 1978). gp 150, another developmentally regulated D. discoideum glycoprotein, has also been purified. Fab' of anti-gp 150 will prevent reaggregation (Geltosky et aZ.,1979). gp 84 has been isolated by trypsin digestion of embryonal carcinoma cell membrane as the target of a Fab preparation that prevents compaction of preimplantation embryos (Hyafil et aZ., 1980). Because of the organ and species specificity of the ACL antiserum used in assaying LAM preparations, it is unlikely that any of the above molecules are identical to LAM. A preliminary report of the partial purification of a proteolytic fragment of an adult rat liver cell adhesion molecule (obrink and Ocklind, 1978) indicates that this protein may be similar to LAM. It is probably not identical to LAM as ACL serum is species specific; however, it may function in a way analogous to chick LAM. During the course of the preparation of this manuscript Bertolotti et al. (1980) published a paper describing the partial purification of a molecule involved in embryonic chick liver cell aggregation. This paper ex-

tends the methods previously used in their laboratory for the purification of CAM from chick neural retina cells. The 68K molecule these authors describe appears in all essential respects to be identical to the LAM we describe (isoelectric point, molecular weight, and ability to elicit an antiaggregation immune response). It would appear that the two laboratories have used similar approaches to identify, assay, and purify the putative chick liver adhesion molecules. Our use of the 65K electrophoresis band to induce a very active antiaggregation immune serum specific for embryonic chick liver cells provides further evidence that LAM is indeed present in the 65K constituent. This is bolstered by the elution from SDS-gels of active LAM from the 65K region of the gel. We have purified LAM as an integral, amphipathic glycoprotein utilizing detergents to maintain solubility and to minimize hydrophobic aggregation. It should be emphasized that LAM has been characterized as an antigen with the ability to neutralize antisera directed against embryonic chick liver cells. No direct evidence has been provided that LAM is directly involved in liver cell species- and organ-specific adhesion. Purification to homogeneity and elucidation of the molecular function of LAM is currently being pursued to provide such evidence.
