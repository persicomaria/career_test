Zinc-binding groups (ZBGs) are exhaustively applied in the development of the new inhibitors against a wide variety of physiologically and pathologically important zinc proteases. Here the a-nitro ketone was presented as a new ZBG, which is a transition-state analog featured by the unique bifurcated hydrogen bonds at the active site of carboxypeptidase A based on the structural analysis. Introduction of a nitro group at the a-position of the ketone could provide more non-covalent interactions without loss of the abilities to form a tetrahedral transition-state analog. ” 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Zinc proteases are a family of enzymes having a catalytically essential zinc ion at their active sites. They include a variety of physiologically and pathologically important species, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and matrix metalloproteases, which are the most studied drug design targets.1,2 The inhibitor design strategies widely applied to these zinc proteases generally make use of a zinc-binding group (ZBG) that can form coordinative bonds to the zinc ion at the active site of the enzymes, which are usually lessons from the inhibition of carboxypeptidase A (CPA, EC 3.4.17.1) as a leading representative.3≠5 For example, captopril,6 an inhibitor of ACE, was discovered by application of the design strategy that originated from 2-benzylsuccinic acid as a potent inhibitor of CPA.7 The other important implication is that the interactions of ketones with CPA were regarded as a model for the inhibition of ACE by carbonyl compounds.8 Introduction of an a-substituent with strong electron-withdrawing abilities could enhance the electrophilicity of the carbonyl, which facilitated the addition of a nucleophile followed by the formation of a hybridized adduct that mimics the transition state (TS) occurring during normal substrate hydrolysis catalyzed by CPA. For example, a-bromo ketone compound is a TS analog inhibitor of CPA but the nonmodified ketone is a substrate analog inhibitor.9,10 Because the TS analogs utilize the binding energies more effectively, such ZBGs derived inhibitors have been in extensive attentions as potential candidate of drug.1

Nitro is a well-known electron-withdrawing group; besides, it could form various hydrogen bonds with the residues at the active site of CPA as shown in the previous report.11 As expected, introduction of the nitro group at the a-position of the ketone should not only remain the abilities to reach a TS mimic but also provide additional interactions with the residues at the active site of CPA. Therefore, we designed 2-benzyl-5-nitro-4-oxopentanoic acid 5 as the CPA inhibitor. Based on the structural analysis of the CPA5 complex, we here present a-nitromethyl ketone as a new TS analog ZBG. All three optically active forms of 5 (RS, R, S) were synthesized as shown in Scheme 1.12 Their inhibitory activities against CPA were evaluated and the corresponding inhibitory constant (Ki) values are collected in Table 1.13 Firstly, it could be found that the Ki values of the series of ketone-based inhibitors against CPA decreased with the increase of the pKa values of the same substituted

acetic acids (Table 1),14 which suggest that the electron-withdrawing abilities of the a-substituents should be the key to the inhibitory potency of the ketone-based inhibitors. Kinetic assay of compound 5 as inhibitors against CPA also disclosed that R-5 is the most potent inhibitor with inhibitory constant as 0.16 lM, which is consistent to the L-specificity of CPA. We are mainly interested in the binding mode of the a-nitromethyl ketone at the active site of CPA. Crystals of the CPA-R-5 complex for X-ray diffraction were then obtained by soaking CPA crystals into the solution containing racemic 5 and determined at a resolution of 1.85 ≈ (PDB code: 3FX6).15 The final model including all residues of CPA and R-5 was refined in the range of 50.0≠ 1.85 ≈ (Table 2). Figure 1 depicts the stereoview of the difference electron density in the region of the active site of CPA that is occupied by R-5. Distances of important interactions between CPA and R-5 in the complex are listed in Table 3. Structural analysis firstly disclosed that R-5 occupies the S10 subsite of CPA, where the benzyl moiety resides in the hydrophobic pocket and the carboxylate makes a salt link with the guanidinium group of Arg-145. Tyr248 is found in the `so-called' down position, which is responsible to the formation of the hydrophobic pocket. Such binding modes are commonly observed in X-ray crystal structures of CPA-inhibitor complexes.16 It is also clearly observed that the ketonic hydrate of the R-5 are bound at the active site of CPA. The so-called `gem-diol' form with tetrahedron configuration exhibits the structurally essential features of the transition state, that is, a bidentate chelation to the zinc ion and two respective hydrogen bonds with Glu270 and Arg-127.17 Thus, the presented R-5 should be a TS analog inhibitor of CPA. Besides the above structural features generally

found in the complexes of CPA and its TS analog inhibitors, the introduced nitro group also forms various hydrogen bonding with the residues at the active site of CPA as expected. Both Arg-127 and Arg-71 are involved in the hydrogen bond with the oxygen (O5) of the nitro group. Thus, the bifurcated hydrogen bond is the other salient structural feature of the CPA-R-5 complex, which should be ascribed to the introduction of the nitro group (Fig. 2). In conclusion, we successfully introduced the nitro group to the ketone skeleton and then developed a-nitromethyl ketone as a new ZBG. The presented ketone-based ZBG not only is a TS analog but also exhibits various hydrogen bonds with the residues at the

CPA was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Allan form, twice crystallized from bovine pancreas, aqueous suspension in toluene) and used without further purification for kinetic assays. Lithium chloride and Tris were obtained from Sigma. O-(trans-p-Chlorocinnamoyl)-L-bphenyllactate (Cl-CPL) was used as the substrate in the kinetic study. All solutions for kinetic study were prepared by dissolving in doubly distilled and deionized water. CPA stock solutions were prepared by dissolving CPA in 0.05 M Tris/0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5 buffer solution and their concentrations were estimated from the absorbance at 278 nm (e278 = 64,200).

solutions were filtered (GHP Acrodic syringe filter, pore size 0.2 lm) before use. Perkin≠Elmer HP 8453 UV≠vis spectrometer was used for UV absorbance measurements. The enzyme stock solution was added to a solution containing Cl-CPL (final concentrations: 50 and 100 lM) and inhibitor (five different final concentrations in the range of 0.5¿2.0 Ki) in 0.05 M Tris/0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5 buffer (1 mL cuvette), and the change in absorbance at 320 nm was measured immediately. The final concentration of CPA was 20 nM. Initial velocities were then calculated from the linear initial slopes of the change in absorbance where the amount of substrate consumed was less than 10%. The Ki values were then estimated from the semireciprocal plot of the initial velocity versus the concentration of the inhibitor according to the method of Dixon.18 Dean, J. A. In Lange's Handbook of Chemistry, 15th ed.; McGraw-Hill: New York, 1999. CPA was washed three times with water to remove toluene used in packaging and then dissolved in 1.2 M LiCl. After centrifugation, the enzyme solution was then diluted to 12≠15 mg/mL with a buffer solution of 1.2 M LiCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5. An aliquot of this solution was then pipetted into a 100 lL glass dialysis button. A 7-kDa molecular weight cutoff membrane, which was pre-washed by doubly distilled and deionized water followed by equilibrated in 0.15 M LiCl, was placed over the button and secured with a rubber O-ring. The button was then dialyzed against 0.2 M LiCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and at 4 ∞C. Crystals appeared after about 4 days on the bottom and edges of the well. The crystals were then crosslinked using a buffer solution containing 0.15 M LiCl and 0.02% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 90 min. The crystals were then transferred to a soaking solution of the same buffer containing 50 lM racemic 5 and stored for 7 days in a cold room (4 ∞C) before data collection. Single crystals grew in the P21 space group with three molecules in one asymmetric unit. Crystallographic data were collected using a Rigaku RA-Micro 7 Desktop Rotating Anode X-ray Generator with a Cu target operating at 40 kV 0¬ 20 mA and R-Axis IV++ imaging-plate detector at a wavelength of 1.5418 ≈. A 0.5-mm collimator was used to keep the A whole crystal bathed in the X-ray beam. A total of 180 images with 1.0∞ oscillation were collected. The collected intensities were indexed, integrated, corrected for absorption, scaled and merged using HKL 2000. Diffraction images were processed with the CCP4 program suite. The structure of native CPA (PDB code 1M4L) was used as the starting model. The programs COOT19 and CNS20 were used in the model building and refinement, respectively. The randomly selected 5% of the data were set aside for the Rfree calculation. Water molecules were gradually added to the model with CNS. Christianson, D. W.; Lipscomb, W. M. Acc. Chem.
