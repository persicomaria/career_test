The Structure of Ap4A Hydrolase Complexed with ATP-MgFx Reveals the Basis of Substrate Binding
Jamie I. Fletcher, James D. Swarbrick, Danuta Maksel, Kenwyn R. Gayler, and Paul R. Gooley1 Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology The University of Melbourne Victoria 3010 Australia with a plasmid carrying the gene encoding this enzyme and another associated gene enhanced the ability of E. coli to invade erythrocytes 6- to 39-fold, with both genes being required [5]. Homologs of the protein are present in the genomes of other pathogenic bacteria, many of which are invasive, leading to the suggestion that the enzyme may be a target for the development of novel antibacterial agents [7]. Understanding the structure, mechanism, and substrate specificity of Ap4A hydrolases is essential to aid in the design of analogs of Ap4A as potential therapeutic agents. To accomplish this, we sought a high-affinity, nonhydrolyzable substrate analog. Here we report the solution structure of the stable complex of Ap4A hydrolase with the substrate analog ATP·MgFx. The structure of the complex shows significant differences to that of the free form. Furthermore, despite sharing a common fold, the substrate binding sites of the two other published Nudix enzyme-substrate or substrate analog complexes, MutT [8] and ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase [9], bear little resemblance to the current structure. Results and Discussion ATP·MgFx Mimics Ap4A Hydrolase Substrates Ap4A, the preferred substrate for the enzyme, is hydrolyzed to form ATP and AMP. However, Ap4A hydrolase (hereafter referred to as Ap4Aase) also efficiently hydrolyzes Ap4, (ATP P), Ap5A (ATP ADP), Ap6A (2 ATP), and Ap4N (ATP NMP, where N is any nucleoside) [10]. The minimum requirement for a substrate thus appears to be Ap4, with ATP always one of the products. Interestingly, in the myosin motor domain, ATPase activity has been demonstrated to be inhibited in the presence of magnesium and fluoride, presumably by the formation of an ADP·MgFx complex that mimics ATP in the active site [11]. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the Dictyostelium discoideum myosin motor domain complexed with ADP·BeFx demonstrates that ADP·BeFx is an analog of ATP in the active site [12], with the tetrahedral geometry of the BeFx moiety closely resembling that of ATP -phosphate. As fluoride has been demonstrated to be a potent inhibitor of asymmetrical Ap4A hydrolases [13] and ATP is a product of Ap4A hydrolysis, we propose that the formation of an ATP·MgFx complex might be involved in fluoride inhibition, and may mimic either Ap4 or a transition state in the active site, and that this complex might serve as an appropriate substrate analog for structural studies. To establish likely chemical shift changes observed for substrate binding, we initially titrated the enzyme with the Ap4A analog P1,P2-difluoromethylene-P3,P4difluoromethylene diadenosine 5 ,5 -P1,P4-tetraphosphate (ApCF2ppCF2pA) [14] in the presence of saturating Mg2 . In a separate experiment, we titrated the enzyme with ATP under the same conditions. A comparison of

Summary Ap4A hydrolases are Nudix enzymes that regulate intracellular dinucleoside polyphosphate concentrations, implicating them in a range of biological events, including heat shock and metabolic stress. We have demonstrated that ATP·MgFx can be used to mimic substrates in the binding site of Ap4A hydrolase from Lupinus angustifolius and that, unlike previous substrate analogs, it is in slow exchange with the enzyme. The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme complexed with ATP·MgFx was solved and shows significant conformational changes. The substrate binding site of L. angustifolius Ap4A hydrolase differs markedly from the two previously published Nudix enzymes, ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase and MutT, despite their common fold and the conservation of active site residues. The majority of residues involved in substrate binding are conserved in asymmetrical Ap4A hydrolases from pathogenic bacteria, but are absent in their human counterparts, suggesting that it might be possible to generate compounds that target bacterial, but not human, Ap4A hydrolases. Introduction The Nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked to x) hydrolases are a large family of enzymes that function to maintain physiological homeostasis by modulating levels of metabolic intermediates, signaling molecules, and potentially toxic substances [1]. Consistent with this hypothesis, the genome of the remarkably radiationresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans has been demonstrated to contain almost twice as many Nudix hydrolase genes as that of Escherichia coli [2]. The Nudix enzymes may be subdivided according to their principal substrates, for example dinucleoside polyphosphates, NADH, and ADP-ribose [3]. We recently determined the structure of one of these enzymes, diadenosine 5 ,5 P1,P4-tetraphosphate (Ap4A) hydrolase, from Lupinus angustifolius (lupin) [4]. The Ap4A hydrolase from the bacterium Bartonella bacilliformis, which has a high degree of sequence homology to the lupin enzyme [4], has been demonstrated to be associated with bacterial invasion [5, 6].

Figure 1. Chemical Shift Changes Resulting from Ligand Titrations (A) Titration with the Ap4A analog ApCF2ppCF2pA (fast exchange). (B) Titration with ATP (fast exchange). (C) Titration with ATP in the presence of fluoride (slow exchange). All titrations were carried out at 25 C using 0.6 mM protein samples in the presence of 20 mM MgCl2. The chemical shift change ( TOTAL) was calculated from 2D [15N,1H]-HSQC spectra using TOTAL 2 1/2 ( N2 in Hz. Where resonances were unable to be H ) , with tracked through titration steps, they were excluded from all three plots. The shift changes shown in (A) and (B) are essentially identical, indicating that the Ap4A analog and ATP bind to the same site on the protein. Similarly, the shift changes observed for the ATP titrations in the absence (B) and presence (C) of fluoride are essentially identical (although the magnitudes are greater in slow exchange), indicating that the ATP binding site is unchanged. The only apparent difference is the additional shift changes observed around residues 116­126 in the ATP·MgFx spectrum, suggesting that this region might be proximal to the MgFx moiety.

the resulting shifts verifies that ATP interacts with the same site as the Ap4A analog (Figures 1A and 1B). In both cases, the substrates are in fast exchange: a single set of peaks is observed, the positions of which migrate with each titration step. In a third experiment, we titrated the enzyme with ATP in the presence of both fluoride and saturating magnesium (Figure 1C). Again, the shifts indicate that the binding site is maintained; however, ATP is in slow exchange: a second set of peaks develops, which increases in intensity as the original set disappears, reaching completion at an enzyme/ATP ratio of 1:1. The slow exchange situation is amenable to detailed structural analysis using NMR spectroscopy. Substrate Binding Results in Structural Changes The high quality of the NMR spectra of the Ap4A hydrolase-ATP·MgFx complex (Figure 2) allowed us to obtain complete 1H, 13C, and 15N assignments for the protein using standard heteronuclear techniques. Assignments for the 1H resonances of the bound ATP were achieved using 2D doubly tuned [13C,15N]-filtered experiments. All ATP resonances were assigned with the exception of the 6-amino group of the adenine ring. The solution structure of Ap4A hydrolase complexed with ATP·MgFx was determined to high resolution. The sequence of Ap4A hydrolase is shown in Figure 3 and a

representative ensemble of 30 structures selected on the basis of lowest residual restraint violations is shown in Figure 4B. The structures show a high degree of precision, have good nonbonded contacts as evidenced by the low Lennard-Jones potentials, and good covalent geometry as evidenced by the low deviations from idealized covalent geometry. Experimental restraints and structural statistics for the ensemble are shown in Table 1. strands are observed at residues 8­17 (A), 23­28 (B), 35­36 (C), 39­41 (C ), 65­70 (D), 75­78 (D ), 97­107 (E), and 126­132 (F). helices are observed at residues 48­59 (I), 84­90 (II), 136­140 (III), and 146­156 (IV), with residues 157­159 being 310 helix (Figure 3). These elements comprise a curved, four-stranded mixed central sheet ( strands A, C, D, and E; see Figure 4C), a twostranded antiparallel sheet ( strands B and F), and with the four helices form an - - sandwich. The secondary structure elements are similar to those observed in the free enzyme [4]. Figures 5A and 5B show an overlay of the free and inhibited structures of Ap4Aase. helix II undergoes a substantial translation inward toward the center of the molecule, reducing the size of the binding site. In an overlay of the average structure of the free and complexed forms of the enzyme (overlaid over residues 1­72 and 96­160 of the average structures), the C atoms of helix II (residues 84­90) are translated through an aver° age of 10.8 A. In addition, helices III and IV and their intervening loop are translated outward from the binding site to accommodate the substrate (the intervening loop ° is translated through an average of 2.5 A), while the loop between strands B and C (residues 28­32) is translated inward slightly toward the binding site (through an aver° age of 1.21 A). As a result of these changes, side chains from helix II and from the helix III-helix IV loop are reoriented to form one side of the substrate binding site. The other side of the binding site is relatively unchanged. These changes cannot be attributed merely to the calculation of the structure in the presence of inhibitor, as (1) calculations performed without the inhibitor result in the same structure for the protein, (2) protein intramolecular NOEs are observed that are absent in the free structure (e.g., between Pro80 just prior to helix II and Phe144 in the helix III to helix IV loop), and (3) different ring current shift effects are observed in the inhibited structure that are consistent with the changed positions of aromatic side chains (e.g., Gln98 HN is observed at 8.50 ppm in the free form and at 6.85 ppm in the complex, where it is proximal to the aromatic ring of Tyr77). Away from the adenosine binding site, the only significant change is that residues 117­123 appear more ordered in the ° inhibited structure (rms devations of 1.35 0.34 A and ° 0.16 0.07 A in the free and complexed forms, respectively). Indeed, this loop shows chemical shift changes in the presence of ATP·MgFx that are not observed with the difluoromethylene Ap4A analog or with ATP (Figure 1), suggesting that this ordering might be related to the binding of the MgFx moiety rather than the inclusion of additional NOEs available as a result of increased sample concentration. Future protein dynamics studies should resolve whether this loop is indeed more ordered and may also indicate whether the conformation observed in the presence of ATP·MgFx is actually sampled in the absence of the substrate.

We previously identified 26 residues that were strictly conserved in plant Ap4A hydrolases and related sequences from pathogenic bacteria (Figure 3) [4]. Of these conserved residues, nine are located in the Nudix motif or have been identified as probable metal ligands, five are involved in interactions with the adenine and ribose groups in the current structure (see below), eight are possibly important to structural integrity (buried hydrophobic residues, or prolines and glycines in turns), and an additional three are positioned such as to be able to interact with the phosphate chain. The current structure clearly provides a model for substrate binding in these enzymes. The Nucleoside Binding Site and the Conformation of ATP As suggested previously [4], the inhibitor binds in the cleft above the central sheet. The observation of slow exchange and a single set of peaks indicate that the

inhibitor binds in a single, stable conformation, facilitating detailed structural analysis, rationalization of substrate specificity, and comparison with related structures. The conformation of the ATP molecule and its interaction with the enzyme were constrained by 18 intraresidue and 43 ATP-enzyme distances. The nucleoside is observed to adopt an anti conformation ( 149.7 1.1 ). This can be discerned qualitatively from the 2D doubly tuned [13C,15N]-filtered NOESY: NOEs between the adenine H8 and the ribose H2 and H3 are stronger than that to H1 ; NOEs are present between H8 and the ribose H5 and H5 ; and the only intraresidue NOEs from H2 are to the ribose H1 and H2 . The ribose exhibits a C3 -endo sugar pucker. The positions of the phosphate groups were not experimentally determined. The NOE data are consistent with a single conformation for the bound ATP molecule. This observation, together with the chemical shifts resulting from titrations of ATP and ApCF2ppCF2pA (Figure 1), suggests that only one

adenosine interacts significantly with the enzyme, even in the case of diadenosine substrates, and therefore the second adenosine has no significant interactions with the protein. The adenine ring binds in a largely hydrophobic pocket lined by the backbone of residue 35 and the side chains of Ile31 and Ala34 on one side, and the backbone of 140­142, the side chains Val142 and Phe144, and the hydrocarbon chain of Lys145 on the other. Looking down the cleft from above the binding site (Figures 5A and 5C), the plane of the adenine ring runs down into the cleft at right angles to the side chains interacting with it. The potentially unfavorable burial of Lys145 is facilitated by extensive hydrophobic interactions with the adenine ring above and the side chains of Tyr77 and Tyr149 below. In addition, Tyr149 OH may hydrogen bond to the -amino group of Lys145 and/or Met37 NH. Notably, Tyr77, Phe144, and Lys145 are completely conserved in all known Ap4A hydrolases. One face of the ribose ring interacts with a largely hydrophobic face formed by the side chains of residues Phe79, Val83, Lys86, and Leu87. The other face interacts with the side chains of Arg28 and Ile31. The Arg28 -guanidino group may hydrogen bond to the ribose O3 (and/or the -phosphate), while the Lys86 -amino group may hydrogen bond to the ribose O2 . While the position of the -phosphate group was not experimentally determined, the precise determination of the ribose group orientates it favorably to interact with Arg28 NH2 (to which it may hydrogen bond), Gln36 NH2, Gln39 NH2, Tyr77, Trp91, and Gln98 NH2. A stereo representation of the ligandprotein interactions is shown in Figure 5C.

Rationalization of Substrate Specificity Several previous studies have investigated substrate specificity in the asymmetrical Ap4A hydrolase from L. luteus [15]. The enzyme shows only minimal variations in activity with the substrates Ap4A (100%), Gp4G (50%), and Gp4G methylated at positions 2 and 7 of the guanosine ring (m2,7Gp4G; 200%). The current structure indicates that position 2 of the adenine ring is highly solvent exposed and free of steric limitations to substitution, while the 6-NH2 group is less exposed and may be involved in hydrogen bonds to the backbone carbonyl of Leu140. This suggests that the slightly reduced activity with Gp4G relative to Ap4A might result from changes to the hydrogen-bonding pattern induced by the substitution to a 6-keto group. N7 of the adenine ring faces the interior of the cleft; however, there appears to be no likely steric hindrance to the addition of a methyl group at this position. The increase in activity with the substrate m2,7Gp4G suggests that the additional methyl group at N7 might enhance the hydrophobic interaction between the adenine ring and the hydrocarbon chain of Lys145. It has also been demonstrated [16] that mono-2 deoxyadenylated Ap4A [(2 -pdA)Ap4A], despite the bulky substitution, is still cleaved in both possible orientations: two sets of products, ATP (2 -pdA)AMP and (2 pdA)ATP AMP are observed at 60% and 40% of the total, respectively. The comparable efficiency of hydrolysis in the two orientations suggests that Ap4A must bind to the enzyme in such a manner as to be able to accommodate the additional adenine moiety. The current structure reveals that the ribose 2 hydroxyl group

is oriented outward from the binding cleft and shows significant solvent exposure. The lack of any steric limitation suggests that an additional bulky substituent could be accommodated without substantial structural rearrangement, consistent with the observed cleavage patterns. Related Enzyme-Substrate Complexes: The ADPRase and MutT Structures To date, the structures of two other Nudix enzymes complexed to their substrates or substrate analogs have been published. These are the E. coli ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase (ADPRase; Protein Data Bank code 1G9Q) [9] and MutT, an E. coli nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (Protein Data Bank code 1TUM) [8]. All three enzymes share the "Nudix" fold [9], and ADPRase has an additional N-terminal domain that is involved in dimerization. Despite the structural homology, the substrate binding sites appear to vary significantly. The substrate binding site from Ap4Aase is discussed above. A large part of the enzyme-substrate analog interaction involves the side chains of helix II (Figure 5C),

a structural element unique to the Ap4Aase. In contrast, ADPRase, a symmetric homodimer, has two substrate binding sites that occur at the dimer interfaces. The adenine ring is contained in a hydrophobic pocket formed by side chains from each monomer. The terminal ribose stacks against a proline residue that is conserved in the Nudix domain of the ADPRase subfamily, but is positioned in a loop from the opposing monomer [9]. The specific interactions bear little resemblance to that seen for Ap4Aase. The substrate binding site of MutT also differs substantially from Ap4Aase. In the MutTAMPCPP structure, AMPCPP is observed to bind to a hydrophobic face across the central sheet, leaving one face of the adenine ring solvent exposed. In each structure, however, the phosphate chain is orientated toward the catalytic helix and the observed or probable location of the catalytic metal. Figure 6 shows the structures of the three enzyme-substrate (or substrate analog) complexes. Despite an absence of similarity in the binding sites of the three enzymes, the adenosine moiety of each ligand adopts a similar conformation: anti ( 149.7

A search of the Protein Data Bank using the DALI server [17] revealed that E. coli isopentenyl diphosphate delta-isomerase (IPI; Protein Data Bank code 1I9A) also possesses a remarkably similar fold to Ap4Aase despite not being a Nudix enzyme and having only 13% sequence identity with Ap4Aase over the aligned regions. However, this enzyme does possess a tyrosine residue (Tyr104) in a spatially equivalent position to Tyr77 in Ap4Aase, a residue that is present in all Ap4A hydrolases [3]. The present study suggests that Tyr77 does not directly interact with the substrate. This, combined with its presence at structurally equivalent positions in enzymes with diverse substrates but similar folds, including MutT (Tyr73), IPI (Tyr104), and ADPRase (Phe130),

suggests that the residue is important to the structural integrity of the enzyme-substrate complex rather than direct substrate binding. Ap4A Binding Differs in Bacterial and Human Ap4A Hydrolases Knowledge of the residues interacting with the substrate in the lupin Ap4A hydrolase has allowed a comparison of the equivalent residues in bacterial (Bartonella bacilliformis) and human sequences. Of the 15 residues identified as being involved in the enzyme-substrate analog interaction, two (Phe144 and Lys145) are strictly conserved in all three sequences (Figure 3). More importantly, eight residues are conserved between the lupin and bacterial enzyme that are absent in the human counterpart. This suggests that the current structure is a good model for the enzyme-substrate interaction in the bacterial enzyme and furthermore that it might be feasible to develop a therapeutic agent that can discriminate

between human and bacterial Ap4A hydrolases by targeting the nucleoside binding site. Biological Implications The asymmetrical Ap4A hydrolases function to regulate intracellular dinucleoside polyphosphate concentrations and have been linked to cellular invasion by pathogenic bacteria [6]. Furthermore, the particularly high resistance to radiation observed for the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans, which contains an unusually high number of Nudix hydrolase genes [2], suggests that these enzymes aid bacterial survival in adverse environments. Ap4A hydrolases have consequently been suggested as potential targets for therapeutics, particularly if inhibitory Ap4A analogs can be designed which discriminate between the bacterial and animal enzymes [7]. Bacterial Ap4A hydrolases have low-sequence homology with the human enzyme; however, they do share a high degree of homology with their plant counterparts. The well-behaved lupin Ap4A hydrolase is thus a good model for the bacterial enzyme. The structure of a stable complex of lupin Ap4A hydrolase and the substrate analog ATP·MgFx allows us to understand substrate specificity and to identify the residues that are involved in the enzyme-substrate interaction. The majority of these residues are conserved between the lupin and bacterial Ap4A hydrolase sequences, whereas only a small number are conserved in the human enzyme (Figure 3). This suggests that it might indeed be possible to develop compounds that selectively target bacterial Ap4A hydrolases by exploiting the differences that this study identifies. In addition to Ap4A hydrolase, the structures of two other Nudix enzymes, ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase (ADPRase) [9] and MutT [8], complexed with their substrates (or substrate analogs), have previously been published. The three enzymes bind analogous substrates--a nucleoside diphosphate linked to some moiety--and share a common fold [9], yet their binding sites are markedly divergent. In addition, unlike Ap4A hydrolase, neither ADPRase nor MutT shows significant structural differences between the free and complexed forms [8, 9, 18]. The current structure thus provides insights into the Ap4A hydrolase subclass of Nudix en-

zymes that cannot be understood simply by analogy to other Nudix enzymes.
Experimental Procedures Sample Preparation Pure 15N- and 13C,15N-labeled Ap4A hydrolase samples were prepared using a glutathione S-transferase system as described previously [4, 19]. The final protein consists of five nonnative N-terminal residues (GPLGS) and residues 40­199 of the L. angustifolius Ap4Aase gene product [20]. Note that in the text, the numbering begins at the first Met residue. The five nonnative N-terminal residues are designated as negative numbers ( 5, 4, 3, 2, 1). NMR samples (600 l, 0.5­1.6 mM) contained 20 mM 2H-imidazole (pH 6.5), 20 mM MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3, and either 100% 2H2O or 90% H2O/10% 2H2O. For determination of substrate exchange regimes, 15N-labeled Ap4Aase samples were titrated in 0.1 mM increments with ApCF2ppCF2pA and with ATP in the absence and presence of NaF. For structure determination, NaF and ATP were present at 20 and 1 the protein concentration, respectively. NMR Experiments NMR experiments were carried out at 25 C using a Varian 600 Inova spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm 1H, 13C, 15N single z axis gradient probe. The ligand exchange regime was monitored via the acquisition of a 2D [15N,1H]-HSQC spectrum at each titration step. For structure determination, the following standard experiments were acquired [21]: 2D [15N,1H]-HSQC, [13C,1H]-HSQC (on 10% 13C-labeled enzyme); 3D CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, CC(CO)NH-TOCSY ( m 18.2 ms), H(CC)(CO)NH-TOCSY ( m 12.1 ms), HNCO, HNHA, HNHB, HACACO, HCCH-COSY, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC ( m 100 ms), and 13 C-edited NOESY-HSQC ( m 100 ms; 13C carrier set to 36.4 and 124.4 ppm for aliphatic and aromatic experiments, respectively). The following additional experiments were acquired: 2D doubly tuned [13C,15N]-filtered TOCSY and NOESY ( m 100 ms) [22], 1H TOCSYrelayed ct-[13C,1H]-HMQC [23], 3D HACAHB-COSY [24], and 13 C-edited, 13C-filtered NOESY-HSQC ( m 100 ms) [25]. Data were processed using NMRPipe [26] and subsequently analyzed in XEASY [27]. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to DSS at 0 ppm; 13 C and 15N chemical shifts were calculated from the 1H spectrometer frequency. Structure Determination NOESY crosspeaks were integrated using the peakint function of XEASY [27]; volumes were converted to distance restraints with the CALIBA macro of DYANA 1.5 [28], using expected distances in secondary structural elements as a calibration guide. Intramolecular restraints for ATP were calibrated to the intensity of the reference ° distance between the H1 and H2 ribose protons (2.9 0.2 A) [29]. Protein-ligand distance restraints from the edited, filtered experiment were calibrated from equivalent NOEs in the 13C-edited NOESY. Dihedral angles were determined using the following experiments

and procedures:  restraints for 91 residues were derived from 3JHN couplings measured from 3D HNHA spectra while , pairs for 98 residues were derived from H , 13C , 13C , 13C , and 15N chemical shifts using the program TALOS [30]. Both sets were entered at 30 . Where restraints were determined by both methods and were inconsistent, the restraints derived from 3JHN couplings were used. Two additional  and ten additional restraints were derived from 13 C chemical shifts [31]. 68 1 restraints were derived using 3D HNHB, HACAHB, and NOESY-HSQC spectra. Stereospecific assignments for 55 H proton pairs was achieved using HNHB and HACAHB-COSY spectra while all Leu and Val methyl groups were stereospecifically assigned with the aid of a [13C,1H]-HSQC spectrum obtained with a 10% 13C-labeled protein sample [32]. Preliminary structures (100) using all experimentally derived restraints were calculated in DYANA 1.5 [28]. The coordinates of the free structure were used to expedite NOE assignments in the early stages. The final stages of refinement were carried out in CNS [33] ° using force constants of 40 kcal mol 1 A 2 and 200 kcal mol 1 rad 2 for distance and dihedral restraints, respectively. Structural homologs were identified using the DALI server [17]. Residues interacting ° with the substrate were defined as those within 4 A of an ATP atom (excluding the - and -phosphate atoms) in at least five structures. Potential hydrogen bond partners were considered to be those sep° arated by less than 2.9 A and making an angle of less than 40 from planar in at least five structures. Structure figures were produced using MOLMOL [34]. Acknowledgments

Accession Numbers The coordinates and experimental restraints for the ensemble of 30 refined structures of the complex of Ap4A hydrolase and ATP·MgFx have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 1JKN. NMR chemical shifts were deposited at the BioMagResBank (BMRB) under accession number 5054. Note that the database entries include the five nonnative N-terminal residues (from the fusion partner). Thus, Met1 in this paper is Met6 in the database entries.
