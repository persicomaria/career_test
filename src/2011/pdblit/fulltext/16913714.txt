Structure-based design and synthesis of novel HIV protease inhibitors are described. The inhibitors are designed specifically to interact with the backbone of HIV protease active site to combat drug resistance. Inhibitor 3 has exhibited exceedingly potent enzyme inhibitory and antiviral potency. Furthermore, this inhibitor maintains impressive potency against a wide spectrum of HIV including a variety of multi-PIresistant clinical strains. The inhibitors incorporated a stereochemically defined 5-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]furanyl urethane as the P2-ligand into the (R)-(hydroxyethylamino)sulfonamide isostere. Optically active (3aS,5R,6aR)-5-hydroxy-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]furan was prepared by an enzymatic asymmetrization of meso-diacetate with acetyl cholinesterase, radical cyclization, and Lewis acid-catalyzed anomeric reduction as the key steps. A protein-ligand X-ray crystal structure of inhibitor 3-bound HIV-1 protease (1.35 Å resolution) revealed extensive interactions in the HIV protease active site including strong hydrogen bonding interactions with the backbone. This design strategy may lead to novel inhibitors that can combat drug resistance.
Introduction The AIDS epidemic is one of the most challenging problems in medicine in the 21st century.1 Among many strategies to combat this disease, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with HIV protease inhibitors (PI) in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors continues to be the first line treatment for control of HIV infection.2 This treatment regimen has definitely improved quality of life, enhanced HIV management, and halted the progression of the disease. Despite these impressive successes, there are serious limitations including major toxicity and complexity of these treatment regimens. Perhaps the most serious problem is that a growing number of patients are developing multi-drug-resistant strains of HIV, and there is ample evidence that these strains can be transmitted.3,4 Thus far, no effective treatment options exist for these patients. In this context, our research emphasis has been to design nonpeptidyl inhibitors and optimize their potency against mutant strains resistant to currently approved PIs. We recently designed and developed a number of protease inhibitors with remarkable antiviral potency and drug-resistance profiles.5,6 As shown in Figure 1, inhibitor 1 (now known as TMC-114, or Darunavir) has shown unprecedented picomolar enzyme inhibitory activity and antiviral potency, favorable drug resistance profiles against multi-drug-resistant HIV and encouraging pharmacokinetic properties.7,8 This inhibitor has recently been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administra* Corresponding author.

tion for treatment of drug-resistant HIV.9 A high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of 1-bound HIV protease has now revealed critical molecular insight into interactions responsible for the observed resistance profiles.10 Structural analysis revealed that close contact of inhibitor 1 with the main chains of the protease active site amino acids (Asp-29 and Asp-30) is critical to its potency and wide-spectrum activity against multi-PIresistant HIV-1 variants. It appears that both P2- and P2-ligands of inhibitor 1 are involved in extensive hydrogen bonding with the protein backbone. Interestingly, examination of X-ray structures of 1-bound protein-ligand complexes of wild-type HIV protease and mutant HIV proteases also revealed only a small distortion in the backbone conformations.10 This is also evident in the X-ray structures of a number of other HIV

protease-inhibitor and related complexes.11,12 Our working hypothesis to combat drug-resistance is to design inhibitors that make maximum interactions in the active site of HIV protease, particularly extensive hydrogen bonding interactions with the protein backbone in both S2- and S2-sites. Conceivably, inhibitors exhibiting maximum hydrogen bonding interactions with the backbone of the wild-type enzyme may also retain potency against the mutant strains. Upon the basis of this presumption, we have now designed and evaluated protease inhibitors (Figure 1) incorporating a novel ligand that can extensively interact with the backbone residues. The inhibitors incorporate a stereochemically defined bicyclic hexahydrocyclo-pentanofuran as the P2-ligand where the cyclic ether oxygen is positioned to hydrogen bond with the backbone Asp-29 NH. The bicyclic ligand is also expected to fill in the S2-subsite effectively. Furthermore, a 4-hydroxymethylphenylsulfonamide is introduced as a P2-ligand so that the hydroxyl group will be optimally positioned to hydrogen bond with the backbone residues in the S2-subsite. Herein we report structure-based design, synthesis, preliminary biological evaluation, and X-ray crystal structure of inhibitor 3-bound HIV-1 protease. The inhibitor has shown remarkable enzyme inhibitory and antiviral potency. Preliminary drug resistance profiles also indicated that the inhibitor maintains impressive potency against multi-PI-resistant clinical HIV-1 variants isolated from patients with drug-resistant HIV. Chemistry For synthesis of target inhibitors 2 and 3, we devised an efficient synthetic route to (3aS,5R,6aR)-5-hydroxy-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]furan in optically active form. As shown in Scheme 1, enzymatic asymmetrization of meso-diacetate with acetyl cholinesterase provided the monoacetate 5 in multigram scale (85% yield).13 Formation of Mosher ester of 5 revealed that enantiomeric purity of 5 was 95% ee.14 Protection of hydroxyl group with TBSCl in the presence of imidazole in THF afforded TBS-ether 615 in 98% yield. Hydrolysis of 6 with potassium carbonate in methanol gave the alcohol. Treatment of the resulting alcohol with ethyl vinyl ether and NBS in CH2Cl2 furnished bromo acetal 7. Radical cyclization16 of 7 with n-Bu3SnH in the presence of AIBN in benzene under reflux furnished bicyclic acetal 8 in excellent yield. Reduction of 8 with Et3SiH in the presence of BF3.OEt2 followed by removal of TBS group with TBAF in THF afforded optically active hexahydrocyclo-

pentafuran-5-ol (9) in 88% yield. Treatment of 9 with N,Ndisuccinimidyl carbonate in the presence of Et3N afforded mixed carbonate 10.17 For the synthesis of inhibitor 4, the corresponding P2-ligand, endo-cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octan-3-ol was synthesized according to Scheme 2. Benzyl ether 11 was synthesized according to the literature procedure.18 Exposure of 11 to iodine in the presence of silver acetate in acetic acid afforded the corresponding iodoacetate derivative.19 Reduction of the resulting iodoacetate with LAH furnished hydroxy benzyl ether 1220 in 50% yield in two steps. The hydroxyl group in 12 was protected as TBSether by reaction with TBSCl and imidazole.21 Subsequent removal of the benzyl ether with sodium in liquid ammonia22 furnished hydroxyl TBS ether 13 in 89% yield. Removal of hydroxyl group in 13 was effected by using Barton-McCombie deoxygenation23 reaction. Thus, alcohol 13 was reacted with N,N-thiocarbonyldiimidazole in a mixture of (2:1) toluene and pyridine at 55 °C for 12 h. The resulting thiocarbonylimidazoyl derivative was treated with nBu3SnH in toluene at reflux to provide TBS ether 14 in 66% yield in two steps. Deprotection of TBS with TBAF in THF21 furnished endo-cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octan-3-ol (15).24 Treatment of alcohol 15 with N,N-disuccinimidyl carbonate in the presence of Et3N in acetonitrile afforded succinimidyl carbonate 16 in excellent yield.17 The synthesis of inhibitor 2 with hexahydrocyclopenta[b]furanyl urethane as the P2-ligand and 4-aminosulfonamide as the P2-ligand is shown in Scheme 3. Nitrosulfonamide derivative 18 was prepared from commercially available epoxide 17 as described previously.25 Catalytic hydrogenation of 18 over 10% Pd/C in ethyl acetate for 11 h afforded the corresponding aminosulfonamide derivative. Subsequent removal of Boc-group was effected by exposure of the resulting aminosulfonamide to trifluoroacetic acid in CH2Cl2 to furnish the corresponding diamine. Selective alkoxycarbonylation of the aliphatic amine with succinimidyl carbonate 10 provided inhibitor 2 in 87% yield in the three-step sequence. Synthesis of inhibitors 3 and 4 was carried out as shown in Scheme 4. For the preparation of hydroxyethylamine sulfonamide inhibitor scaffold, commercially available epoxide 17 was reacted with isobutylamine in 2-propanol. Treatment of the resulting amino alcohol with p-(diacetoxymethyl)phenylsulfonyl

chloride26 in the presence of diisopropylethylamine furnished sulfonamide derivative 19. It was converted to hydroxymethylsulfonamide derivative 20 by deprotection of the acetates with K2CO3 and subsequent reduction of the resulting aldehyde with NaBH4 in methanol. Sulfonamide derivative 20 was converted to inhibitor 3 by removal of Boc group by exposure to trifluoroacetic acid and reaction of the resulting amine with succinimidyl carbonate 10 and diisopropylethylamine in CH2Cl2. Inhibitor 2 was obtained in 80% yield. Similarly, reaction of the resulting amine with succinimidyl carbonate 16 afforded inhibitor 4 in 87% yield. Results and Discussion Inhibitors with hexahydrocyclopenta[b]furanyl urethane as the P2-ligand have shown impressive in vitro potency. Inhibitors 2-4 were evaluated in enzyme inhibitory and antiviral assays and the results are shown in Table 1. For enzyme inhibitory assay, we utilized the protocol described by Toth and Marshall27

and the Ki-values denote the mean values of at least four determinations. As can be seen, inhibitor 2 which incorporates a stereochemically defined hexahydrocyclopenta[b]furanyl urethane as the P2-ligand and 4-aminosulfonamide as the P2-ligand has shown enzymatic Ki value of 0.14 nM. As described previously, the X-ray crystal structure of protein-ligand complex of 1 and HIV-1 protease revealed that structural changes on the P2-aryl ring could lead to improved interaction with the Asp-29 and Asp 30 NH.10 In an effort to make the compound interact with backbone residues in the S2-pocket more effectively, we incorporated a hydroxymethylsulfonamide derivative as the P2-ligand in inhibitor 3. This inhibitor exhibited a very impressive Ki value of 4.5 pM. To examine the importance of the ring oxygen of (3aS,5R,6aS)-5-hydroxyhexahydro-cyclopenta[b]furanyl ligand in inhibitor 3, the corresponding inhibitor 4 with an endo-3-bicyclo[3.3.0]octanyl urethane as the P2-ligand was evaluated. As shown, inhibitor 4 has shown an enzymatic Ki value of 5.3 nM, a >1100-fold reduction in potency compared to 3. This marked difference in enzyme inhibitory potency is also reflected in their antiviral potency. Inhibitor 3 has shown an antiviral IC50 value of 1.8 nM in MT-2 human T-lymphoid cells exposed to HIV-1LAI. Consistent with its enzyme inhibitory potency, inhibitor 2 has also shown good antiviral activity. In comparison, compound 4 has exhibited antiviral IC50 value of >1 µM, a drastic >500fold reduction with respect to inhibitor 3. We have compared antiviral potency of inhibitor 3 against various FDA approved protease inhibitors. It has maintained a remarkable potency in MT-2 cells exposed to HIV-1LAI compared to other FDA approved protease inhibitors. Antiviral activity against three different HIV isolates was determined in PHA-PBMC and MT-2 cells. The results are shown in Table 2. This inhibitor exerted far more potent activity against two HIV-1 isolates (HIV-1LAI and HIV-1Ba-L) in both MT-2 cells and PHA-PBMC than all currently available approved protease inhibitors examined. In addition, it was as potent against HIV2EHO as indinavir and nelfinavir with an IC50 value of 21 nM. In vitro cytotoxicity of inhibitor 3 was minimal and its concentration that reduced the viability of target cells by 50% (CC50) was greater than 100 µM. We also examined inhibitor 3 for its antiviral activity against a panel of multi-drug-resistant HIV-1 variants as shown in Table 3. An HIV-1 clinical strain HIV-1ET, isolated from a drug-naive ¨ patient with HIV-1 infection, was sensitive to all protease inhibitors examined, among which inhibitor 3 was most potent with the lowest IC50 value of 3 nM. In contrast, each of six drug-resistant clinical strains containing 10-12 protease inhibi-

All values were determined in triplicate. The IC50 values were determined by employing PHA-PBMC as target cells and the inhibition of p24Gag protein production as the endpoint.

tor resistance-associated amino acid substitutions (HIV-1B, HIV1C, HIV-1G, HIV-1TM, HIV-1EV, and HIV-1ES), isolated from patients with HIV-1 infection having received 7-11 different antiviral agents for 24 to 81 months,5,7 was highly resistant to all the currently available protease inhibitors tested (Table 3). However, inhibitor 3 exerted highly potent activity against all of these six variants with IC50 values ranging 4-52 nM. An HIV-1 variant, HIV-1K, which was selected in vitro in the presence of up to 5 µM concentrations of nelfinavir and contains five amino acid substitutions including D30N,7 was also tested against inhibitor 3. It was found that inhibitor 3 was highly potent against HIV-1K with an IC50 value of as low as 3 nM (Table 3). These data indicate that inhibitor 3 is highly active against a wide spectrum of drug-resistant variants. Overall, the potency of inhibitor 3 against the HIV-1 strains tested in the present study was comparable to that of inhibitor 1. To gain molecular insight into the ligand-binding site interactions responsible for its potent antiviral activity against a wide spectrum of multi-PI-resistant HIV-1 variants, we have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the inhibitor complex with wild-type protease at 1.35 Å resolution.28 A stereoview of the inhibitor 3-bound structure is shown in Figure 2. The central hydroxyl group of the inhibitor forms four hydrogen bonds to the active site Asp25 and Asp25 side chains, with the distances

2.6-3.2 Å. An oxygen of the sulfonamide group and the carbamate carbonyl oxygen form hydrogen bonds (2.8 and 2.9 Å, respectively) to the conserved water molecule that is hydrogen bonded to the backbone NH groups of Ile50 and Ile50, as is commonly seen in HIV-1 protease/inhibitor complexes.29 The oxygen of the P2 hexahydrocyclopentafuran forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of Asp29 with the distance between heavy atoms of 2.8 Å. This interaction cannot occur for inhibitor 4 which lacks the ring oxygen. The P2 hexahydrocyclopentafuranyl group also makes good C-H,,,O contacts with the main-chain carbonyl of Gly48. The amide nitrogen of the carbamate moiety has a 3.2 Å hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Gly27. The hydroxyl of the P2 benzyl alcohol group forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone NH (3.1 Å) and a watermediated contact with the side chain oxygen of Asp30 (OHinh, ,,H2O,,,OOC distances are 2.5 and 2.3 Å, respectively). Therefore, the inhibitor 3 forms three direct hydrogen bonds and three water-mediated contacts to the protease residues, excluding contacts with catalytic aspartates. The important hydrophobic contacts include C-H,,, interactions. The P1 benzyl group makes C-H,,, interactions with Pro81 and Val82 (3.6-3.8 Å). The P1 isobutyl group lies in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Pro81, Val82, Ile84, Gly49, and Ile-

Protein backbones are represented as alpha-carbon traces. Red ) wild-type; blue ) 2FDD; green ) 1SGU; yellow ) 1HSH. Note that, despite the multiple mutations, backbone positions change very little, especially in the active site, and hydrogen bonds to backbone NHs are not disrupted. Also, the hydroxymethyl is able to hydrogen bond to both the backbone and the side chain of Asp-30.

50. The P2 group also forms a number of C-H,,, contacts with Ala28, Val32, Ile47, and Ile50, with distances of 3.63.9 Å with the closest interaction involving the side chain of Val32. Inhibitor 3 participates in extensive interactions in the S2 to S2 subsites, including tight hydrogen bonding with the protein backbone. Other PIs typically show fewer interactions with the main chain atoms. These interactions of inhibitor 3 with the protease backbone may explain its superior antiviral property and its potent activity against a wide spectrum of multiPI-resistant HIV-1 strains. To evaluate interactions of inhibitor 3 with the multi-drugresistant variants of HIV-1 protease listed in Table 3, we have compared our crystal structure with several published crystal structures containing multiple mutations.30-35 The structures used for comparison, and the relevant mutations, are listed in Table 4. None of these structures corresponds exactly to proteases of the multi-drug-resistant HIV-1 variants illustrated in Table 3, but these structures incorporate 21 of the 33 mutations listed in Table 3. The other mutations in Table 3 (V11I, T12E, I15V, L19I, M46L, K55R, D60E, K70Q, A71T, I72L, G73C, and L89M) have not, to our knowledge, been present in published crystal structures, with the exception of M46L. This mutation has been published only in unliganded crystal structures, in which the active site is open and distorted.36,37 Residues 11, 12, 15, 19, 46, 55, 60, 70, 71, 72, 73, and 89 are all far from the active site, so that the effects of these mutations on drug resistance must be indirect and, therefore, difficult to model or predict. A stereoview of inhibitor 3 bound to the active site of wild-type HIV-1 protease, superimposed upon the structures of the three most highly mutated drug-resistant proteases (from Table 3), is shown in Figure 3. In each case, a least-squares fit of protease alpha-carbons was carried out, and the interactions of inhibitor 3 with the mutant

protease were examined. In all six structures, the following interactions were maintained: (a) hydrogen bonding of the secondary OH of the inhibitor to Asp-25 and Asp-25 of the active site; (b) hydrogen bonding of the tetrahydrofuran oxygen of the inhibitor to the backbone NH of Asp-29, and a possible hydrogen bond to the backbone NH of Asp-30; (c) hydrogen bonding of the CH2OH of the inhibitor to the backbone NH of Asp-30; (d) hydrogen bonding of the CH2OH of the inhibitor to the side chain carboxylate of Asp-30 (requires 10-20° rotation of the side chain around the C-alpha:C-beta bond to optimize hydrogen bond distance; (e) in P2, van der Waals contact with Gly-48; (f) in P1, van der Waals contact with Gly49, Ile-50, Leu-23, and Pro-81; (g) in P1, van der Waals contact with Ile-84; (h) in P2, van der Waals contact with Ile50, Asp-30, Val-32, and Ile-47. Furthermore, many other binding interactions were also retained. These include: (a) in P2, van der Waals contact of Ile-47 was retained in all structures except 1HSH, which has the I47V mutation; van der Waals contact of Ile-50 was retained in four of the structures, but was reduced in 2FDD (which has the I50V mutation) and in 2AZC; (b) in P1, van der Waals contact of Val-82 was reduced in 2FDD, 1SGU, and 2AZC, all of which have the V82A mutation; van der Waals contact of Ile-84 was retained in all structures except 1SGU, which has the I84V mutation; (c) in P1, van der Waals contact of Pro-81 was reduced in 1HSH, 2AZC, and 1B6K; van der Waals contact of Val-82 was reduced in 2FDD, 1SGU, and 2AZC, all of which have the V82A mutation. All six were able to maintain binding to the water molecule in the binding site, with the exception of the 2AZC structure; as reported,33 one of the flaps of this structure is distorted and a second water molecule is required for inhibitor binding to one of the Ile50 NH groups. It is noteworthy that, even in multi-drug-resistant

proteases with a number of mutations, the hydrogen bonding interactions of inhibitor 3 with the protease backbone are well maintained. Conclusion In summary, we have reported here the structure-based design of novel HIV-1 protease inhibitors incorporating a stereochemically defined 5-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]furanyl urethane as the P2-ligand and a 4-hydroxymethylsulfonamide as the P2-ligand. The inhibitors are designed with the purpose of making extensive interactions including hydrogen bonding with the protein backbone of HIV-1 protease active site. One such inhibitor (3) has exhibited exceedingly potent antiviral activity and superior activity against multi-PI-resistant variants compared to other FDA approved PIs. The synthesis of P2-ligand alcohol, (3aS,5R,6aR)-5-hydroxy-hexahydrocyclopenta[b]furan was carried out enantioselectively by an enzymatic asymmetrization with acetyl cholinesterase as one of the key steps. A proteinligand crystal structure of 3-bound HIV-1 protease (1.35 Å resolution) revealed extensive interactions in the enzyme active site. Of particular note, both P2 and P2-ligands are involved in hydrogen bonding with the backbone of both S2- and S2subsites. Comparison of protein-ligand X-ray structure of 3 with others structures of mutant proteases clearly indicated that the backbone interactions are maintained. The design of an inhibitor to specifically interact with the backbone may serve as an important guide to combat drug resistance. Further design and chemical modifications are currently underway. Experimental Section
General. All moisture sensitive reactions were carried out under nitrogen or argon atmosphere. Anhydrous solvents were obtained as follows: THF, diethyl ether and benzene, distilled from sodium and benzophenone; dichloromethane, pyridine, triethylamine, and diisopropylethylamine, distilled from CaH2. All other solvents were HPLC grade. Column chromatography was performed with Whatman 240-400 mesh silica gel under low pressure of 5-10 psi. TLC was carried out with E. Merck silica gel 60-F-254 plates. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Mercury 300 and Bruker Avance 400 and 500 spectrometers. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Mattson Genesis II FTIR instrument. Optical rotations were measured using a Perkin-Elmer 341 polarimeter. (1R,4S)-(+)-4-(tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxy)-2-cyclopentenyl Acetate (6). To a stirred solution of alcohol 5 (1.1 g, 7.6 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) was added imidazole (779 mg, 11.4 mmol) followed by tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (1.54 g, 9.5 mmol).

MT-2 cells were grown in an RPMI-1640-based culture medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 50 unit/mL penicillin, and 50 µg/mL of streptomycin. The following HIV-1 viruses were used for the drug susceptibility assay: HIV-1LAI, HIV1Ba-L, and HIV-2EHO.7,9 3-Azido-2,3-dideoxythymidine (AZT or zidovudine) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Saquinavir (SQV) and ritonavir (RTV) were kindly provided by Roche Products Ltd. (Welwyn Garden City, U.K.) and Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, Ill.), respectively. Indinavir (IDV) and Nelfinavir (NFV) were kindly provided by Japan Energy Inc., Tokyo. Amprenavir (APV) was a kind gift from Glaxo-Wellcome, Research Triangle, NC. Drug Susceptibility Assay. The susceptibility of HIV to various drugs was determined as previously described7,9 with minor modifications. Briefly, MT-2 cells (2 × 104/mL) were exposed to 100 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) of HIV in the presence of various concentrations of drugs in 96-well microculture plates and were incubated at 37 °C for 7 days. After 100 µL of the medium was removed from each well, 3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) solution (10 µL, 7.5 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well in the plate, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. After incubation, to dissolve the formazan crystals, 100 µL of acidified 2-propanol containing 4% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added to each well and the optical density measured in a kinetic microplate reader (Vmax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate. In determining the sensitivty of HIV isolates to drugs, phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PHA-PBM) (1 × 106/mL) were exposed to 50 TCID50 of each isolate and cultured in the presence or absence of various concentrations of drugs in 10-fold serial dilutions in 96well microculture plates. On day 7 of culture, the supernatant was harvested and the amount of p24 Gag protein was determined by using a fully automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system (Lumipulse F; Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo).7,9 Drug concentrations that suppressed the production of p24 Gag protein by 50% (IC50) were determined by comparison with the p24 production level in drug-free control cell culture. All assays were performed in triplicate. Determination of X-ray Structure of Inhibitor 3-Bound HIV ProteaseWT. The X-ray crystal structure of inhibitor 3 bound to HIV ProteaseWT has been deposited in the Protein Databank with access code 2HB3. The crystals of the PRWT complexed with GRL06579A, which was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method using 10:1 molar ratio of the inhibitor to protein. The well solution contained sodium acetate buffer (pH ) 4.2) and 1.4 M NaCl. Crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant solution containing the reservoir solution plus 20-30% (v/v) glycerol, mounted on a nylon loop, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected on the ×26C beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory at 90 K using 0.96 Å wavelength. Data were processed using HKL2000.39 A medium-sized platelike crystal, with dimensions of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm, diffracted to 1.35 Å resolution with mosaicity of 0.4° and produced an Rsym value of 5.0% (52%) for data between 50 and 1.35 Å resolution. These data were reduced in space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions of a ) 58.1 Å, b ) 86.5, c ) 45.9 Å with one dimer per asymmetric unit. The CPP4i suite of programs40,41 was used to obtain a molecular replacement solution using as the starting model the PRL90M complex with TMC114 (PDB code 2F81), which is in the same space group. The

structure was refined using SHELX9742 and refitted using O 10.43 Alternate conformations were modeled for the protease residues when obvious in the electron density maps. Anisotropic atomic displacement parameters (B-factors) were refined for all atoms including solvent molecules. Stereochemical parameters for the inhibitor were created using GAUSSIAN03 with the DFT quantumchemical method. Hydrogen atoms were added at the final stages of the refinement. The identity of ions and other solvent molecules from the crystallization conditions was deduced based on the shape and peak height of the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density, the potential hydrogen bond interactions and interatomic distances. The crystal structure was refined with three chloride anions, two sodium cations, one glycerol molecule, and 205 water molecules including partial occupancy sites. The final Rwork (Rfree) values were 14.7% (19.2%) for all data between 10 and 1.35 Å resolution. The rmsd values from ideal bonds and angles were 0.012 Å and 3.0°. The average B-factor for all atoms was 20.9 Å2; the average B-factor for atoms of the inhibitor was 12.7 Å.
