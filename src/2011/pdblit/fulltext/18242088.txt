Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects approximately 170 million individuals worldwide and is a leading cause of chronic liver disease. About 70% of infected people will develop chronic histological changes in the liver (chronic hepatitis) with a high risk of advancing to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma.1 The current standard of care for HCV is a combination therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Unfortunately, this treatment provides benefit for less than 50% of genotype 1 infected patients and is associated with adverse events.2 There-

fore there is an urgent need for the development of more effective HCV therapies especially for genotype 1 patients. As part of our efforts to develop small molecule nonnucleoside inhibitors of HCV NS5B, a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp),3 we discovered a series of 5-hydroxy-3(2H)-pyridazinone derivatives (1, Fig. 1) using a structure-based design approach. In a separate communication,4 we discussed the structure­activity relationships (SAR) associated with variation of the R3 substituents in this series and identified the ­OCH2CONH2 moiety as a suitable fragment for obtaining potent NS5B inhibition properties. Here we

describe biological properties associated with the systematic alteration of the 2- and 6-pyridazinone substituents in a series of molecules (2) which contain this optimal R3 substituent. As depicted in Scheme 1, three methods (A, B, and C) were developed to synthesize pyridazinone benzothiadiazinedioxide derivatives (5) bearing a methoxy group at the 7 0 -position. Method A utilized the key 3(2H)pyridazinone ester intermediates (3), which were prepared from a-keto-esters via an efficient three-step synthesis.5 Condensation of 3 with 2-amino-5-methoxy-benzenesulfonamide (4)6 in refluxing pyridine in the presence of DBU afforded the desired products 5. In method B, hydrazones 6 were prepared by condensation of the corresponding a-keto-esters with alkyl hydrazines (or their oxalic acid salts).5 Compounds 6 underwent DCC-mediated coupling with (7-methoxy1,1-dioxo-1,4-dihydro-1k6-benzo[1,2,4]-thiadiazin-3-yl)acetic acid (7)6 and the resulting hydrazide intermediates were subsequently cyclized to 5 by treatment with a base such as triethylamine or NaOEt. Alternatively, hydrazones 6 could be converted to 5 directly in one step by heating with (7-methoxy-1,1-dioxo-1,4-dihydro-1k6benzo[1,2,4]thiadiazin-3-yl)acetic acid ethyl ester (8)6 at 160 °C (method C). In general, methods A and B gave higher yields than method C. Compounds 5 were then transformed to the target molecules 2 by treatment with BBr3 to form the corresponding 7 0 -phenol intermediates and subsequent O-alkylation with 2-bromoacetamide in the presence of K2CO3 at 80 °C. A variety of pyridazinone compounds 2 were synthesized using the methods described above.7 The inhibitory activities of these compounds in genotype 1a and 1b NS5B enzyme assays as well as in a 1b replicon assay were evaluated. The results of these biological assessments are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

As previously described in a separate communication,4 compound 2a (Table 1) exhibited good inhibitory potency against the genotype 1b enzyme. However, it was 5-fold less potent in the genotype 1a enzymatic assay. Compounds bearing R2 groups that were comparable in linear length to the isoamyl moiety present in 2a exhibited slightly improved activity in the biochemical assay (2b and 2c). However, they were significantly less potent in the genotype 1b replicon assay compared to compound 2a. Adding an F-atom to the terminus of the isoamyl group (2d) or introducing a 2,2-dimethylbutyl group (2e) led to a significant loss in activity in the biochemical assay when compared with 2a. Interestingly, compound 2e exhibited equipotent antiviral properties in the replicon assay as compared to 2a. In addition, introduction of R2 alkyl groups that were longer or shorter than the isoamyl moiety led to compounds with NS5B inhibition activities comparable to 2a against the genotype 1b enzyme (2f and 2g). However, these molecules were less potent than 2a in both 1b replicon and 1a enzyme assays. Furthermore, compounds bearing a methylene spacer between the pyridazinone core and a cyclic moiety displayed decreasing NS5B inhibition activities with increasing ring size (2h­2j). When compared to 2j, compound 2k having a benzyl R2 substituent displayed weaker antiviral potency in the 1b replicon assay although the inhibitory activity in the enzyme assay was improved. The different EC50/IC50 ratios observed likely resulted from the differences in cell permeability and protein binding.10 In general, this series of 5-hydroxy-3(2H)-pyridazinone derivatives under study was 3- to 14-fold less potent against genotype 1a NS5B relative to the genotype 1b enzyme. We believe that this potency shift was likely due to the amino acid residue difference of Y415F (phenylalanine in genotype 1a vs tyrosine in genotype 1b) located near the R2 sub-pocket at the palm binding site.11

The above efforts led to the identification of the R2 substituents present in compounds 2a­2c and 2h as optimal moieties for obtaining potent NS5B inhibitory activity. We then explored combinations of these R2 fragments with various R1 substituents in an effort to further improve potency. The impact of R1 substitution on the inhibitory activity against genotype 1a and 1b enzymes as well as the 1b replicon is summarized in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the 3-thiophene analog (2l) was 9-fold more potent in the 1b replicon assay than the corresponding 2-thiophene-containing compound (2b). However, introducing a methyl group at the 5-position

of the 2-thiophene ring resulted in a significant loss of activities in both enzyme (30-fold) and replicon assays (4-fold) (compare 2m with 2b). This trend was observed with several other inhibitors (2n and 2o) bearing different R2 substituents (compare with 2c and 2h, respectively). The co-crystal structure of 2m bound to NS5B12 revealed that this methyl group was unable to access the small sub-pocket in the R1 region as originally intended. Instead, the methyl fragment rested on the NS5B surface and generated unfavorable interactions with nearby polar protein residues. These interactions were the likely cause of the observed decrease in the inhibition activity of 2m. A similar reduction in potency was observed by introducing a

methyl group at the 3-position of the thiophene ring (compare 2p with 2a). The co-crystal structure of 2p complexed with the NS5B protein12 showed that the

addition of the methyl group caused a change in orientation of the thiophene ring relative to the unsubstituted ring. This change placed the methyl group in

close proximity with polar protein atoms and this may explain the reduction in potency observed for 2p. In addition, replacement of the 2-thiophene ring with a 5-thiazole moiety led to very potent compounds (2q and 2r) possessing activities comparable to 2a and 2b in both enzyme (1b and 1a) and replicon assays. This result was consistent with the analysis of the co-crystal structure of 2q bound to the NS5B protein (Fig. 2). The pyridazinone and benzothiadiazine rings of 2q adopted a nearly co-planar geometry which was highly favorable for binding to the NS5B palm site. The 5-thiazole ring, rotated approximately 16° out of plane relative to the pyridazinone ring, was able to effectively access the sub-pocket in the R1 region. This rotation is similar to the rotation of the 2-thiophene moiety in 2a-NS5B Xray co-crystal structure.12 These rotations were smaller than the rotation of a phenyl R1 group (R2 = isoamyl, R3 = OMe) as we discussed previously.4 Due to its larger size, a phenyl ring needs to rotate more to avoid a close interaction with Gly410 and Asn411. This could explain some of the differences between the IC50 values of 2q or 2a and the phenyl substituted analogs. Additionally, a

number of direct or water-mediated H-bonds were formed between the sulfonamide O-atoms and residues Ser556, Ser288, and Gly449 as well as between the acetamide R3 moiety and residues Asn291 and Asp318. These favorable structure features, which were almost identical to those observed in the X-ray co-crystal structure of 2a-NS5B,4 may explain the high potency of compound 2q. A schematic diagram shown in Figure 3 summarizes the observed interactions in the co-crystal structure of compound 2q bound to the NS5B protein. Surprisingly, the replacement of the 2-thiophene ring with a 2-thiazole moiety (2s and 2t) caused a significant loss in inhibitory potency in both enzyme and replicon assays when compared with 2a and 2h, respectively. The reasons for this loss in biological activity are not yet well understood. Furthermore, introduction of alkyl R1 substituents into the inhibitor design (2u­2y) did not afford any improvements in NS5B inhibitory potency as compared with compound 2a. In order to better predict the in vivo metabolic stability of this new class of pyridazinone derivatives, the effect of R1 and R2 substituents on stability toward human liver microsomes (HLM) was evaluated. As shown in Table 1, the measured HLM half-life for compound 2a was relatively short (23 min). We reasoned that, in addition to the unsubstituted thiophene ring present in 2a, the secondary C-atom of the terminal isoamyl group might also be a potential site for cytochrome P450 (CYP) catalyzed metabolism. Accordingly, an F-atom was introduced at the secondary C-atom of the isoamyl fragment and this resulted in a more stable compound (2d) (t1/2 = 39 min). However, the addition of a methyl group at this position did not improve the stability of the resulting molecule (2c) (t1/2 = 21 min). Interestingly, inclusion of a more branched R2 group of the same linear length as the isoamyl moiety or a large cyclohexyl R2 fragment resulted in very stable compounds (2e and 2j, respectively; t1/ 2 > 60 min). In contrast, compound 2k, bearing a benzyl R2 moiety, had a short half-life (23 min) possibly due to CYP-mediated modification of the benzene ring (compare 2k with 2j). The measured HLM half-lives for the rest of compounds (2b, 2f­2i) in Table 1 were relatively short (<30 min). Alkyl R1 substituents shown in Table 2 led to the least stable compounds (2u, 2x) with very short half-lives (610 min). Similar to compound 2b bearing a 2-thiophene moiety, the 3-thiophene group also led to a compound (2l) with a short half-life (16 min). As the 5-position of the 2-thiophene ring is a potential site for oxidation catalyzed by CYPs,15 we introduced a methyl group at this position to block such metabolism. This change resulted in a significant improvement in the stability of the resulting compounds 2m, 2n, and 2o when compared with 2b, 2c, and 2h, respectively. Both 2-thiazole and 5-thiazole moieties led to very stable compounds (2q­2t) with t1/2 P 60 min. The above results indicated that both R1 and R2 substituents significantly affected the metabolic stability of the resulting molecules.

In summary, we synthesized a new class of 4-(1 0 ,1 0 -dioxo-1 0 ,4 0 -dihydro-1 0 k6-benzo[1 0 ,2 0 ,4 0 ]thiadiazin-3 0 -yl)-5hydroxy-2H-pyridazin-3-one derivatives (2) as potent inhibitors of genotype 1 HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B). The optimization of the 2- and 6-substituents of the pyridazinone derivatives resulted in significantly improved potencies in both biochemical (1b and 1a) and replicon (1b) assays. In addition, our SAR studies revealed that both R1 and R2 substituents significantly affected the HLM stability of the molecules. Further optimization of this new class of pyridazinone compounds will be discussed in future communications.

NS5B polymerase inhibition assay (1a IC50, lM): assays were performed in a 96-well streptavidin-coated FlashPlate using 50 nM enzyme (NS5B H77 1a), 0.5 lCi of [a33P]GTP, 0.6 mM GTP, and 250 nM 5 0 biotinylated oligo (rG13)/poly rC in 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 g/L bovine serum albumin, and 100 U/mL RNAse inhibitor. The reaction was stopped by aspiration after 75 min at 28 °C and the plate was washed several times with 150 mM NaCl aqueous solution. After washing and drying the plate, incorporated radioactivity was counted using a Microbeta scintillation counter. IC50 values were calculated relative to the uninhibited control and inhibition data were fitted to a 4-parameter IC50 equation.
