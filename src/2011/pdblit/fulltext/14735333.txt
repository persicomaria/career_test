Abstract The structure of oxidized Rhodopseudomonas palustris cytochrome c556 has been modeled after that of high-spin cytochrome c¢ from the same bacterium, the latter being the protein with the greatest sequence identity (35%) among all sequenced proteins in the genomes. The two proteins differ in the number of ligands to iron and in spin state, the former being six-coordinate low-spin and the latter five-coordinate high-spin. In order to validate this modeled structure, several structural restraints were obtained by performing a restricted set of NMR experiments, without performing a complete assignment of the protein signals. The aim was to exploit the special restraints arising from the paramagnetism of the metal ion. A total of 43 residual-dipolar-coupling and 74 pseudocontact-shift restraints, which together sampled all regions of the protein, were used in conjunction with over 40 routinely obtained NOE distance restraints. A calculation procedure was undertaken combining the program MODELLER and the solution structure determination program PARAMAGNETIC DYANA, which includes paramagnetism-based restraints. The directions and magnitude of the magnetic

susceptibility anisotropy tensor were also calculated. The approach readily provides useful results, especially for paramagnetic metalloproteins of moderate to large dimensions. Keywords Cytochrome c556 Æ Metalloproteins Æ NMR spectroscopy Æ Paramagnetism Æ Structure determination

Introduction
Cytochrome c556 is a monomeric low-spin protein, one of the class II cytochromes c [1]; it has a four a-helix bundle fold with a heme attached covalently near the Cterminus. In this class of proteins, the heme iron can also be high-spin, as for example in cytochromes c¢, which, in fact, feature a five-coordinate iron with an axial histidine [2, 3]. The iron in cytochrome c556 is six-coordinate, with histidine and methionine axial ligands [4]. All class II cytochromes c possess a methionine near the NH2 terminus. Slight differences in orientation of the a-helices may cause the methionine residue either to be in close contact with the heme iron to make the iron six-coordinate and low-spin (as in cytochrome c556), or to be far away, so the iron is five-coordinate and high-spin (as in cytochrome c¢) [4, 5]. Cytochromes c556 have been extracted and purified from Rhodopseudomonas palustris [1, 6], Agrobacterium tumefaciens [1, 4, 5], Rhodobacter sulfidophilus [7], and Rhodobacter capsulatus [8]. The sequence of the Rps. palustris protein shows 35% [4] identity with that of cytochrome c¢ from the same bacterium, whose structure ° is known at 2.3 A resolution [9]. It is generally believed that reliable models for proteins of unknown structure can be built if there is greater than 30% homology [10] with a protein of known structure. Therefore, we have modeled the structure of cytochrome c556 on that of cytochrome c¢, and we have validated the model by using a set of experimental restraints and the program DYANA for solution structure determination. The restraints

were largely obtained from paramagnetism-based spectroscopy parameters. Such experimental parameters are particularly meaningful as the heme in the model and in the template have different coordination numbers. In the case of paramagnetic molecules, pseudocontact shifts and self-orientation residual dipolar couplings can be determined after assignment (even partial) of the backbone and other selected residues. The validated model will be reliable if the restraints are distributed evenly over the protein structure.

To measure 1JNH couplings, a series of eight 2D 15N­1H 1J modulated HSQC experiments were performed both at 800 and 400 MHz. The dephasing delays D were 23.6, 24.2, 24.8, 25.4, 26.6, 27.2, 27.8, and 29.0 ms. The influence of the 15N 180° pulse duration was accounted for by respectively adding 0.048 and 0.038 ms to the 800 and 400 MHz dephasing delays.

Pseudocontact-shift restraints In paramagnetic metalloproteins, the metal magnetic susceptibility tensor, vpara, is usually anisotropic, owing to orbital contributions to the electron magnetic moment. In solution, this anisotropy produces pseudocontact shifts of the nuclei that are dipole­dipole coupled to the paramagnetic metal ion [12]. The pseudocontact shifts are given by the following equation [13, 14]: ! À Á 3 1 dpcs ¼ ð1Þ Dvpara 3 cos2 hi À 1 þ Dvpara sin2 hi cos 2/i i ax 2 rh 12pri3 where Dvpara vpara are the axial and rhombic anisotropy parameters ax rh of the magnetic susceptibility tensor of the paramagnetic metal ion: vpara þ vpara xx yy Dvpara ¼ vpara À ð2Þ ax zz 2 Dvpara ¼ vpara À vpara xx yy rh ð3Þ

Materials and methods
Sample preparation The (pEE)/pET c556 plasmid was co-transformed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 with the pEC86 plasmid, which expresses the ccm genes needed for heme insertion in cytochrome c. Cells harboring both plasmids were grown on LB plates, selected with 60 lM/mL ampicillin and 30 lM/mL chloramphenicol. For protein preparation, cells were grown with 1.5 L of LB with antibiotics at 37 °C. Induction was not necessary in the rich medium. Maximum protein expression was obtained 12 h after inoculation. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm, and lysed by osmotic shock. The supernatant was concentrated (Amicon), applied to a column of CM-Sepharose, and then eluted with a 0­200 mM NaCl gradient. Red fractions were pooled together, applied to a G75 Sephadex column, and then eluted with 50 mM Tris (pH 8). Fractions with an A-value%0.2 (A=A280/A416) were pooled together. The mass of the protein was determined by mass spectrometry (MS, 14,795 Da). 15 N-labeled protein was obtained from cultures in minimal medium containing 1 g/L (15NH4)2SO4 supplemented with 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, 10 mL basal medium Eagle vitamin solution, 34 lg/L of chloramphenicol, and 100 lg/L of carbampicillin. The carbon source was glucose (4 g/L). Induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactoside was necessary in minimal medium; maximum expression was reached by inducing expression when OD600 was at half its maximum (ca. 0.8) 12 h after induction. The yield of purified protein was 45 mg/L from rich medium and 13 mg/L from minimal medium. The high yield may be due to the fact that only nitrogen was limiting in the medium. NMR samples were ca. 3 mM in protein at pH 6.8­7.0 in the presence of 0.5 M sodium phosphate. High buffer concentrations gave sharper NMR spectra.

where ri, hi, and /i are the polar coordinates of nucleus i with respect to the principal axes of the magnetic susceptibility tensor centered on the metal ion. Pseudocontact shifts of the N and HN atoms have been measured by direct comparison of the 1H­15N HSQC of oxidized and reduced cytochrome c556. Data are estimated to be affected by an error of 0.2 ppm for NH and 0.3 ppm for N atoms.

Residual dipolar coupling restraints Partial self-orientation of paramagnetic proteins at high magnetic fields is attributable to their magnetic susceptibility anisotropy, as the sum of the magnetic anisotropy of the protein in a diamagnetic state and the magnetic anisotropy related to the paramagnetic metal ion, vpara [12]. Therefore, the 1J15N­1H splitting of the backbone amides experiences residual dipolar coupling, which adds to the scalar 1J value, and is given by [14, 15]: DmRDC ðHzÞÃ ¼ À 1 B2 cN cH " 1 h 0 3 4p 15kT 2p rNH !

NMR spectroscopy NMR spectra of reduced and oxidized samples of cytochrome c556 were acquired on Bruker Avance 800, 700, and 400 spectrometers. The temperature for all experiments was set at 294 K unless otherwise stated. 1D NOE, 2D NOESY, 3D 1H­15N HSQC TOCSY and 3D 1 H­15N HSQC NOESY [11] experiments at 700 or 800 MHz were performed to assign backbone resonances. The 3D 1H­15N HSQC NOESY experiment was recorded with 2048 (1H)·64 (15N)·180 (1H) data points. The spectral window was 16, 32, and 16 ppm for the direct 1H dimension, 15N, and indirect 1H dimension, respectively. The mixing time was 100 ms and the recycle time 1 s. The 3D 1H­15N HSQC TOCSY experiment was recorded with 1024 (1H)·48 (15N)·128 (1H) data points. The spectral window was 16, 41, and 16 ppm for the direct 1H dimension, 15N, and indirect 1H dimension, respectively. The mixing time was 80 ms and the recycle time 0.9 s. In these experiments, the delay between the 1H 90° pulse following the mixing period and the first subsequent 15N 90° pulse was set to 5.3 ms. 2D NOESY experiments with spectral widths of 55 and 15 ppm in both frequency dimensions were acquired. In the former experiment the mixing time was 40 ms, in the latter 90 ms.

where h is the angle between the 15N­1H vector and the z axis of the overall molecular v tensor, W is the angle describing the position of the projection of the 15N­1H vector on the xy plane of the overall molecular v tensor, relative to the x axis, and: vxx þ vyy Dvax ¼ vzz À ð5Þ 2 ð6Þ Dvrh ¼ vxx À vyy By making measurements at two different fields (e.g. 400 and 800 MHz), we can use Eq. 4 to obtain the residual dipolar coupling (RDC) due to the overall magnetic susceptibility anisotropy of the molecule, because the RDC depends on the square of the applied magnetic field.

Structure calculation Modeling was performed with the model-default option of the program MODELLER [16] using the alignment obtained from the program SIM [17] and with 12 as the gap open penalty and 4 as

226 the gap extension penalty. The heme was treated as a block residue, and the lowest energy structure was selected among 200 calculated structures. From such structures, NOEs were backcalculated for proton ° distances closer than 6 A. Then a modified version of the program DYANA [18], called PARAMAGNETIC DYANA [19, 20], which permits simultaneous use of pseudocontact shifts and residual dipolar couplings as restraints, together with NOEs, was used for the structure calculations. From randomly generated conformers, a family of 200 structures was calculated in 10,000 annealing steps. The quality of the structures is assessed by a properly defined function (target function) proportional to the squared deviations of the calculated restraints from the experimental ones, plus the squared van der Waals contact violations.

Results and discussion
The solution structure of Rps. palustris cytochrome c556 was obtained by using the following strategy: a collection of a restricted set of experimental NMR restraints, unable by itself to provide the protein structure, was obtained and coupled with an extensive set of distance restraints backcalculated from the structure modeled by the program MODELLER. Then the program PARAMAGNETIC DYANA was used to calculate the structure. The consistency of the experimental restraints with the resulting structure provides a validation for the obtained structure. NMR data The 1H NMR spectrum of Rps. palustris cytochrome c556, shown in Fig. 1, is similar to those of other lowspin Fe(III) c-type cytochromes [21, 22, 23]. We selected experiments so we could readily assign a few peaks in the NMR spectrum of c556. First we assigned some of the broad hyperfine shifted signals of the axial ligands through 1D NOE experiments [24, 25, 26]. Signals at )16 and )2 ppm (at 294 K) were respectively assigned to Hc and -CH3 of the putative methionine-12 ligand; these signals always are upfield in cytochromes [27, 28]. The broad signal at )9 ppm was assigned to H1 of

histidine-121. A 2D NOESY experiment [29, 30] was performed with a short mixing time in a large spectral window, optimized for the detection of fast relaxing signals; the spectrum was used to assign several heme resonances as well as paramagnetically shifted signals of other protons close to the heme. 3D 1H­15N HSQC TOCSY and 3D 1H­15N HSQC NOESY spectra, acquired at 700 and 800 MHz, respectively, were used to assign sequential backbone resonances. Starting from glycine residues, as they have characteristic N shifts, sequential assignment was performed as long as it was straightforward. Certain difficulties were overcome by examination of the 2D NOESY data in the paramagnetic region. About 60% of the backbone HN atoms were assigned easily and unambiguously. From the assigned peaks and NOE analysis, 9 distance restraints between protein residue atoms plus 35 distance restraints between protein residue and heme atoms (including 15 restraints among porphyrin atoms) were obtained. Distance restraints between protein residue atoms refer to residues close in the sequence (with one exception, corresponding to that between residue 48 and 89), and thus are of little utility for the validation process; heme atoms have distance restraints with protein residues 13, 16, 71, 75, 82, 86, 89, 120, and 121. Pseudocontact shifts of N and HN atoms were measured by comparing the positions of peaks in the 1 H­15N HSQC spectra of oxidized and reduced cytochrome c556. To avoid relying only on external 15N shift reference, the two spectra were slightly shifted relatively to one another along the 15N dimension until the shifts of a sizable number of 15N signals coincided. The latter peaks were later recognized to belong to 15N nuclei far from the paramagnetic metal. We could initially identify only 32 unambiguous pseudocontact shifts. To resolve peak ambiguities, we used a strategy already tested in other cases [31]. Employing the program FANTASIAN [32], these shifts were fit to the initial model structure to obtain an estimate of the vpara tensor. This estimate was used to calculate pseudocontact shift values for all other N and HN backbone atoms, which were then used to resolve ambiguities (74 pseudocontact shifts were evaluated in this way; see Supplementary material). All 74 shifts were then fit with FANTASIAN to recalculate the anisotropic part of vpara, which gave good agreement with the initial value of the tensor. Values for the magnetic susceptibility anisotropy of the metal, together with pseudocontact shifts as structural restraints, were provided to PARAMAGNETIC DYANA. Residual dipolar couplings between H and N amide nuclei (which restrain NH vector orientations [15]) were obtained from measurements at 800 and 400 MHz (see Supplementary material). The statistical distribution of RDC values, mainly of the same sign, indicates the predominantly a-helical secondary structure (43 residual dipolar coupling restraints were obtained). The alignment tensor was calculated with FANTAORIENT [15] using the best 10 structures obtained with

227

PARAMAGNETIC DYANA without including such restraints. Model calculations Cytochrome c556 was modeled using the X-ray structure of cytochrome c¢ from Rps. palustris [9]; the alignment was performed with the program SIM (Fig. 2). The protein structure calculated with MODELLER [16] has a four-helix fold, as expected (Fig. 3). The four helices are built from residues 5­27, 34­53, 79­99, and 103­124. The model suggests that methionine-12 is the most probable of the three methionines in the N-terminal domain to be an axial ligand in the folded protein (Fig. 3B). At variance with the distance restraints, pseudocontact shift and residual dipolar coupling restraints cannot be incorporated in the standard version of MODELLER. We thus used the model structure obtained from the MODELLER program as a starting structure for the package PARAMAGNETIC DYANA [18, 19, 20] designed to solve solution structures. All distances between ° protons closer than 6 A in the modeled structure were selected, and upper distance limits were obtained by ° adding 1 A to these values. Through these upper distance restraints, the dihedral angle restraints for the residues in a-helices, plus the experimental (44 NOEs, 74 pseudocontact shifts and 43 residual dipolar couplings) restraints, 200 structures were calculated. A family of 10 structures with the lowest target function (for all the restraints) had RMSD ° to the mean of 0.60 A (Fig. 4A). The target function was ° 3.3­3.8 A2, and it was given by similar contributions from the calculated upper distance restraints, pseudocontact shift, and residual dipolar coupling restraints. The RMSDs per residue of the family is shown in Fig. 5. The final family is particularly precise (small RMSD per residue) in three regions (5­20, 35­55, and 75­125) that roughly correspond to helices I, II, and III­IV. Addition of experimental paramagnetic restraints did not change in a relevant way the structure first obtained with MODELLER (see Fig. 4C), the backbone RMSD of the final mean PARAMAGNETIC DYANA struc-

° ture relative to that from MODELLER being 1.12 A. Actually, a general agreement among restraints derived from the modeled structure and experimental restraints is observed, as shown by the good agreement between calculated and experimental pseudocontact-shift and residual-dipolar-coupling values (Fig. 6), and by the fact

without and with experimental restraints, it can be noted that the addition of paramagnetic experimental restraints actually refined the protein fold in the region between residues 110­120, thereby indicating that the precision of the modeled structure in that region is increased by the experimental restraints. The magnetic susceptibility tensors Four cycles of FANTASIAN­FANTAORIENT/ PARAMAGNETIC DYANA were perfomed to obtain a stable orientation of metal and molecular magnetic susceptibility tensors, as well as their anisotropy parameters, as follows: Dvparaax=1.0·10)32 m3; Dvpararh=)0.6·10)32 m3; Dvax=)2.6·10)32 m3; and Dvrh= 0.4·10)32 m3 (for the meaning of the parameters, see the Materials and methods section). The fit of both pseudocontact-shift and residual-dipolar-coupling values in the final family is quite reasonable (Fig. 6). The correlation coefficient between calculated and experimental pseudocontact shifts is in fact 0.88; that between calculated and experimental residual dipolar couplings is 0.95. The average standard deviation from the calculated values is 0.10 ppm for pseudocontact shifts and 0.16 Hz for residual dipolar couplings, i.e. smaller than the estimated error on the measurements, which is about 0.2 ppm and 0.3 Hz, respectively. As expected for heme proteins [33], the vparazz axis is reasonably close to the perpendicular to the heme plane; the angle between vparazz axis and the heme plane perpendicular is around 20°. Similar deviations have already been reported for other cytochromes [27, 34, 35]. The x axis makes an angle of about 45° with the Fe­ N(pyrrole II) direction. The alignment tensor axes are not parallel to the metal susceptibility tensor axes, the z axis of the alignment tensor forming an angle of about 47° with the heme plane perpendicular, thereby indicating a strong diamagnetic contribution to the molecular magnetic susceptibility. In fact, the value of |Dvax| is much larger than the metal magnetic susceptibility anisotropy, Dvparaax. The values of the anisotropies of the magnetic susceptibility tensor are of the expected order of magnitude. The metal axial anisotropy (Dvparaax=1.0·10)32 m3) is somewhat smaller than the value usually obtained for low-spin iron(III) hemeproteins, which is about 1.5­ 2.5·10)32 m3. In cytochrome b562, which has the same axial ligands as cytochrome c556, for instance, Dvparaax was calculated as 1.6·10)32 m3 and Dvpar)32 3 a m [36], whereas Dvax was rh=)0.7·10 )2.0·10)32 m3 and Dvrh=0.5·10)32 m3 [37]. In many low-spin iron(III) hemeproteins, the directions of the metal susceptibility axes are related to the relative arrangements of the side chains of the axial ligands. Heuristic equations have been obtained for the case of histidine cyanide and bis-histidine ligands [36]. In the case of a single axial histidine ligand bound to the iron ion, in fact it was shown that the x axis of the metal

that the contribution to the target function due to distance restraints obtained from the modeled structure is the same in the two families calculated with and without inclusion of the experimental restraints (if this were not the case, a strategy could be to remove violating distance restraints calculated from the modeled structure. This will result in a model structure that is made more reliable by the agreement with the available experimental restraints). The ligands methionine-12 and histidine-121 are positioned in a very reasonable way with respect to the heme plane (Fig. 4B). The family was evaluated with PROCHECK. Residue percentages in allowed, generously allowed, and disallowed regions are respectively 94.1, 4.3, and 1.6%. The structures were also satisfactory in terms of H-bond energy (1.1 kJ mol)1) and dihedral angle G-factor ()0.3). After comparison of the RMSD per residue calculated among the lowest target function families obtained

susceptibility tensor rotates counter-clockwise and the histidine plane rotates clockwise by the same angle measured from the N(pyrrole II) direction [33]. If two histidine ligands are present, the x axis of the metal susceptibility tensor rotates counter-clockwise and the bisector of the two histidine planes rotates clockwise by the same angle. In cytochrome c556 the axial ligands are a histidine and a methionine, as in the case of cytochrome b562. No general rule has been found for such systems. In both cytochrome b562 and cytochrome c556 the resonance shift of methyls 1 and 5 is larger than the shift of methyl 3, which is larger than that of methyl 8. In the case of cytochrome b562 [36], the observed x axis was at 27° counter-clockwise from the N(pyrrole II) direction, the histidine plane was at 30° clockwise and the nodal plane of the lone pair of the sulfur atom of the methionine at )5° clockwise. For the modeled structure of cytochrome c556, where the x axis is rotated counterclockwise by about 45°, as we have seen, the histidine plane is about perpendicular to the N(pyrrole II) direction, whereas the nodal plane in the methionine is rotated by a few degrees clockwise. From the dependence of the observed shifts of methyl protons on the orientation of a planar axial ligand, or the mean orientation of two equally important axial ligands [33], a value for the angle of about 10° clockwise is obtained, thus suggesting the methionine ligand is dominant in determining the orientation of the nodal plane of the heme, and thus the shifts of the heme methyls, in the present system. Paramagnetism-based restraints as a validation tool In conclusion, the approach we used to obtain the solution structure of Rps. palustris cytochrome c556 was that of looking for an experimentally fast procedure for confirming/refining the structure obtained with a modeling program. Our validation procedure is thus based on the measurement of pseudocontact shifts and residual dipolar couplings. In fact, these paramagnetism-based restraints are long-range restraints and, as such, are available for all protein regions and are able to detect large global deviations from the modeled structure. Pseudocontact shifts both contain information on the distance of the observed nuclei from the metal ion and on its orientation in a proper frame; residual dipolar couplings depend on the orientation of the coupled nuclei direction (peptidic N­H in our case) with respect to a proper frame. On the other hand, NOE restraints are more useful to detect local deviations from the modeled structure, but are ineffective to validate the global protein fold, unless a large number of restraints among residues far in the protein sequence is obtained, which is usually a time consuming procedure. Actually, as recently stated [38], residual dipolar couplings are able to indicate substantial differences in interhelical angles, corresponding to negligible changes in proton distances, and thus not detectable with NOE restraints.

The proposed strategy of using paramagnetism-based restraints for model validation can be broadly employed, as it applies not only to proteins containing a paramagnetic metal ion, but also to diamagnetic proteins containing a metal ion, after substitution with a paramagnetic one, or to proteins without any metal ion, when they can be tagged with a paramagnetic probes.

Conclusions
In the era of structural genomics, where structures are needed in rapid fire fashion, modeling can play an important role. NMR of paramagnetic molecules can readily add restraints to modeling algorithms. Here we modeled the c556 structure after that of a protein with 35% homology (MODELLER), then we calculated upper distance limits for protons in the model, and, after that, with such restraints plus pseudocontact shifts and residual dipolar couplings, we obtained a family of 10 structures (PARAMAGNETIC DYANA). We emphasize that pseudocontact shifts, even if decrease rapidly (r)3) as the distance increases from the metal ion, are long-range restraints due to the large paramagnetic susceptibility anisotropy of the metal ion, so that information can be obtained even far from the region where the metal ion is located. Residual dipolar couplings are different, because they do not depend on the distance from the metal ion, and can be obtained throughout the molecule; they depend on the overall molecular magnetic anisotropy, which is largely paramagnetic in origin. Other restraints, of course, especially those derived from chemical shifts or from cross correlations between Curie and dipole­dipole relaxation [39], can be incorporated. The procedure involves analysis of interactions over the entire molecule, and as such adds an element of confidence in the structural model that is obtained.
