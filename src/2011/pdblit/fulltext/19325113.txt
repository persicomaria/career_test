Structure of P-Glycoprotein Reveals a Molecular Basis for Poly-Specific Drug Binding
Stephen G. Aller,1 Jodie Yu,1 Andrew Ward,2 Yue Weng,1,4 Srinivas Chittaboina,1 Rupeng Zhuo,3 Patina M. Harrell,3 Yenphuong T. Trinh,3 Qinghai Zhang,1 Ina L. Urbatsch,3 Geoffrey Chang1 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) detoxifies cells by exporting hundreds of chemically unrelated toxins but has been implicated in multidrug resistance (MDR) in the treatment of cancers. Substrate promiscuity is a hallmark of P-gp activity, thus a structural description of poly-specific drug-binding is important for the rational design of anticancer drugs and MDR inhibitors. The x-ray structure of apo P-gp at 3.8 angstroms reveals an internal cavity of ~6000 angstroms cubed with a 30 angstrom separation of the two nucleotide-binding domains. Two additional P-gp structures with cyclic peptide inhibitors demonstrate distinct drug-binding sites in the internal cavity capable of stereoselectivity that is based on hydrophobic and aromatic interactions. Apo and drug-bound P-gp structures have portals open to the cytoplasm and the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer for drug entry. The inward-facing conformation represents an initial stage of the transport cycle that is competent for drug binding.

he American Cancer Society reported over 12 million new cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths worldwide in 2007 (1). Many cancers fail to respond to chemotherapy by acquiring MDR, to which has been attributed the failure of treatment in over 90% of patients with metastatic cancer (2). Although MDR can have several causes, one major form of resistance to chemotherapy has been correlated with the pres-

ence of at least three molecular "pumps" that actively transport drugs out of the cell (3). The most prevalent of these MDR transporters is P-gp, a member of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)­binding cassette (ABC) superfamily (4). P-gp has unusually broad poly-specificity, recognizing hundreds of compounds as small as 330 daltons up to 4000 daltons (5, 6). Most P-gp substrates are hydrophobic and partition into the lipid bilayer (7, 8). Thus, P-gp has been likened to a molecular "hydrophobic vacuum cleaner" (9), pulling substrates from the membrane and expelling them to promote MDR. Although the structures of bacterial ABC importers and exporters have been established (10­15) and P-gp has been characterized at low resolution by electron microscopy (16, 17), obtaining an x-ray structure of P-gp is of particular interest because of its clinical relevance. We describe the structure of mouse P-gp (ABCB1), which has 87% sequence VOL 323 SCIENCE

identity to human P-gp (fig. S1), in a drug-binding­ competent state (18, 19). We also determined cocrystal structures of P-gp in complex with two stereoisomers of cyclic hexapeptide inhibitors, cyclic-tris-(R)-valineselenazole (QZ59-RRR) and cyclic-tris-(S)-valineselenazole (QZ59-SSS), revealing a molecular basis for poly-specificity. Mouse P-gp protein exhibited typical basal adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity that was stimulated by drugs like verapamil and colchicine (fig. S2A) (20). P-gp recovered from washed crystals retained near-full ATPase activity (fig. S3). Both QZ59 compounds inhibited the verapamilstimulated ATPase activity in a concentrationdependent manner (fig. S2B). Both stereoisomers inhibited calcein-AM export with median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in the low micromolar range (fig. S4) and increasing doses of QZ59 compounds resulted in greater colchicine sensitivity in P-gp­overexpressing cells (fig. S5). The structure of P-gp (Fig. 1) represents a nucleotide-free inward-facing conformation arranged as two "halves" with pseudo two-fold molecular symmetry spanning ~136 Å perpendicular to and ~70 Å in the plane of the bilayer. The nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are separated by ~30 Å. The inward-facing conformation, formed from two bundles of six transmembrane helices (TMs 1 to 3, 6, 10, 11 and TMs 4, 5, 7 to 9, 12), results in a large internal cavity open to both the cytoplasm and the inner leaflet. The model was obtained as described in (18) by using experimental electron density maps (figs. S6 and S7 and table S1), verified by multiple Fobs ­ Fcalc maps (figs. S8 to S10), with the topology confirmed by (2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)mercury(II) chloride (CMNP)­labeled cysteines (figs. S6, B to D; S7C, and S11, and table S2). Two portals (fig. S12) allow access for entry of hydrophobic molecules directly from the membrane. The portals are formed by TMs 4 and 6 and TMs 10 and 12, each of which have smaller side chains that could allow tight packing during NBD dimeriza-

tion (table S3). At the widest point within the bilayer, the portals are ~9 Å wide, and each is formed by an intertwined interface in which TMs 4 and 5 (and 10 and 11) crossover to make extensive contacts with the opposite a-helical bundle (Fig. 1). Each intertwined interface buries ~6900 Å2 to stabilize the dimer interface and is a conserved motif in bacterial exporters (13, 14). The structure is consistent with previous cross-linking studies that identified residue pairs in the intertwined interface (fig. S13). The volume of the internal cavity within the lipid bilayer is substantial (~6000 Å3) and could accommodate at least two compounds simultaneously (21). The presumptive drug-binding pocket is made up of mostly hydrophobic and aromatic residues (table S3). Of the 73 solvent Fig. 1. Structure of P-gp. (A) Front and (B) back stereo views of PGP.

TM domains and NBDs are also labeled. accessible residues in the internal cavity, 15 are polar and only two (His60 and Glu871), located in the N-terminal half of the TMD, are charged or potentially charged. In this crystal form, two P-gp molecules (PGP1 and PGP2) are in the asymmetric unit and are structurally similar, with the only appreciable differences localized in the NBDs and the four short intracellular helices (IHs 1 to 4) that directly contact the NBDs (fig. S14). P-gp can distinguish between the stereoisomers of cyclic peptides (Fig. 2, A and B), which result in different binding locations, orientation, and stoichiometry. QZ59-RRR (Fig. 2A) binds one site per transporter located at the center of the molecule between TM6 and TM12 (Fig. 2, C and E). The binding of QZ59-RRR to the "middle" site is mediated by mostly hydrophobic residues on TMs 1, 5, 6, 7, 11, and 12 (table S3). QZ59SSS (Fig. 2B) binds two sites per P-gp molecule (Fig. 2, D and F). The QZ59-SSS molecule occupying the "upper" site is surrounded by hydrophobic aromatic residues on TMs 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, and 12 (table S3) and a portion of this ligand is disordered in both PGP1 and PGP2 (fig. S15). The ligand in the "lower" site that binds to the C-terminal half of the TMD is in close proximity to TMs 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 and surrounded by three polar residues (Gln721, Gln986, and Ser989). The cocrystal structures of P-gp with QZ59 compounds demonstrate that the inward-facing conformation is competent to bind drugs. Previ-

ous studies have identified residues that interact with verapamil (fig. S1) (22, 23). Many of these residues face the drug-binding pocket (Fig. 3A and figs. S15 and S16, and table S3) and are highly conserved (fig. S1), which suggests a common mechanism of poly-specific drug recognition. For QZ59-RRR and both QZ59-SSS molecules, the isopropyl groups point in the same direction, toward TMs 9 to 12 (Fig. 3A). Although certain residues in P-gp contact both QZ59 compounds, the specific functional roles of the residues binding each inhibitor are different (fig. S17). For example, F332 contacts the molecules in the upper but not lower sites of QZ59SSS but does contact the inhibitor in the middle (QZ59-RRR) site (fig. S17, C and J). F724 is near both the middle (fig. S17E) and lower (fig. S17M) sites, but is much closer to a selenium atom in QZ59-SSS. V978 plays an important role having close proximity to all three QZ59 sites (fig. S17, H and N). Note that both F724 (human F728) and V978 (human V982) are protected from methanethiosulfonate-verapamil (MTS-verapamil) labeling by verapamil (22, 23) (Fig. 3B and figs. S1 and S18), which indicates that both are important for drug binding. Although the upper half of the drug-binding pocket contains predominantly hydrophobic and aromatic residues, the lower half of the chamber has more polar and charged residues (fig. S19). Hydrophobic substrates that are positively charged may bind using these residues similarly to the poly-specific drug-binding pockets of QacR and EmrE that use residues like glutamate to neutralize different drugs (24, 25). The drug-binding pocket of P-gp is nearly six times as large as that of BmrR (YvcC) and hPXR and differs significantly from AcrB, wherein drug binding is mediated by residues from b sheets on the extracellular side of the inner cell membrane (26­28). For P-gp, along with the permeases from the three H+ drug antiporter families (MATE, SMR, and MFS), the drug­binding site resides in the cell membrane and is formed by TM helices. Extraction of drug directly from the cytoplasm­ lipid bilayer is a common theme (29). In fact, most P-gp substrates readily partition into the plasma membrane, and lipids are required for drug-stimulated ATPase activity (30). P-gp is a unidirectional lipid flippase (4), transporting phospholipids from the inner to outer leaflets of the bilayer (31). The inward-facing conformation of P-gp (Fig. 1) provides access to an internal chamber through two portals (fig. S12) that are open wide enough to accommodate hydrophobic molecules and phospholipids. The portals form a contiguous space spanning the width of the molecule that allow P-gp to "scan" the inner leaflet to select and bind specific lipids and hydrophobic drugs before transport (Fig. 4). Lipids and substrates may remain together during initial entry into the internal cavity and could explain their requirement in promoting ATPase activity. To accommodate its largest substrates, P-gp may sample even wider conformations in the cell membrane than observed in this crystal form. We were able to soak small hydrophobic heavymetal compounds [ethyl-mercury(II) chloride, 255 daltons, and tetramethyl-lead, 267 daltons] directly into preformed native P-gp crystals, but not QZ59 compounds (660 daltons) (fig. S20). Cocrystals of P-gp with QZ59-RRR and -SSS were only obtained by preincubating these compounds with detergent-solubilized P-gp before crystallization. Taken together, we propose that P-gp samples widely open conformations both in detergent-solution and within the membrane to bind larger molecules. Consistent with this hypothesis, a very wide open inward-facing crystal structure of the bacterial homolog of P-gp, MsbA, was previously determined and could accommodate its large substrate, Kdo2-lipid A (Mr 2.3 kD)

(14). This large degree of flexibility is also supported by data from electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of MsbA in the lipid membrane (32), as well as the inward-facing conformation of other ABC transporters that also have NBDs far apart (33, 34). The inward-facing structure does not allow substrate access from the outer membrane leaflet nor the extracellular space (Fig. 4A). We propose that this conformation represents the molecule in a pretransport state, because we demonstrate drug binding to an internal cavity open to the inner leaflet and cytoplasm. This conformation likely represents an active state of P-gp because protein recovered from crystals had significant drugstimulated ATPase activity. During the catalytic cycle, binding of ATP, stimulated by substrate, likely causes a dimerization in the NBDs, which produces large structural changes resulting in an outward-facing conformation similar to the nucleotide-bound structures of MsbA or Sav1866 (Fig. 4B). Depending on the specific compound, substrates could either be released as a consequence of decreased binding affinity caused by changes in specific residue contacts between the protein and drug going from the inward- to outwardfacing conformation or, alternatively, facilitated by ATP hydrolysis. In either case, ATP hydrolysis likely disrupts NBD dimerization and resets the system back to inward facing and reinitiates the transport cycle (35) (Fig. 4).

Guo-Yun Chen,1 Jie Tang,4 Pan Zheng,1,2* Yang Liu1,3* Patten recognition receptors, which recognize pathogens or components of injured cells (danger), trigger activation of the innate immune system. Whether and how the host distinguishes between danger- versus pathogen-associated molecular patterns remains unresolved. We report that CD24-deficient mice exhibit increased susceptibility to danger- but not pathogen-associated molecular patterns. CD24 associates with high mobility group box 1, heat shock protein 70, and heat shock protein 90; negatively regulates their stimulatory activity; and inhibits nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) activation. This occurs at least in part through CD24 association with Siglec-10 in humans or Siglec-G in mice. Our results reveal that the CD24­Siglec G pathway protects the host against a lethal response to pathological cell death and discriminates danger- versus pathogen-associated molecular patterns. athogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) interact with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on innate immune cells to initiate protective immune responses (1­3). Danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (4), which are intracellular components such as high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), and cellular RNA released during cellular injury, also induce TLRdependent inflammatory responses (5­8). Whether the host is able to discriminate between DAMPs and PAMPs is not clear. We used an acetaminophen (AAP)-induced liver necrosis model (9) to identify genes that regulate the innate immune response resulting from tissue injury. A sublethal dose of AAP (10 mg/ mouse), which is tolerated by wild-type (WT) mice, caused rapid death of CD24-deficient (CD24-/-) mice within 20 hours (Fig. 1A). We then tested whether CD24 regulated the inflammatory response to AAP-induced liver injury because CD24 is

expressed on liver oval cells and hematopoeitic cells, but not on hepatocytes (10). Indeed, we detected a massive increase in the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemotactic protein­1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor­a (TNF-a) after AAP treatment (Fig. 1B). This was accompanied by increased amounts of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), which is indicative of liver damage (Fig. 1C), and liver hemorrhage and necrosis (Fig. 1D). These observations revealed that CD24 protects against AAP-induced hepatoxicity, most likely by regulating the inflammatory response. CD24 is a small glycosylphosphoinositolanchored protein that is able to provide costimulatory signals to T cells and has been implicated in the development of autoimmune disease (11­15). We set out to identify proteins that associate with CD24 because none of the known CD24 ligands provided insight into its protective effect in our liver injury model. We focused on proteins whose interactions can be disrupted by the cation chelator EDTA, because more than 90% of the mass of CD24 is estimated to be derived from glycosylation (12) and because protein-polysaccharide interactions largely depend on cations. Briefly, we immunoprecipitated CD24 and its associated proteins from lysates of mouse splenocytes. The proteins eluted by EDTA were subjected to high-throughput mass spectrometry analysis and SDS­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). HMGB1, a prototypical VOL 323 SCIENCE

CD24 and Siglec-10 Selectively Repress Tissue Damage­Induced Immune Responses

DAMP molecule that activates the immune response following tissue damage (16), was among the most prominent proteins that we identified (Fig. 2A and table S1). HMGB1 coimmunoprecipitated with CD24 and this interaction was specific (Fig. 2B and C). A recombinant CD24-Fc fusion protein specifically coimmunoprecipitated recombinant HMGB1, demonstrating that the interaction between CD24 and HMGB1 was direct (Fig. 2D). To determine whether the hypersensitivity to AAP observed in CD24-/- mice was the result of an enhanced immune response to HMGB1, we injected AAP-treated mice with antibodies to HMGB1 (fig. S1). In one representative experiment, blockade of HMGB1 rescued 87.5% of the mice that received AAP (Fig. 2E). Treated mice exhibited decreased ALT abundance, indicating reduced hepatocyte destruction (Fig. 2F). The production of IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF-a was also greatly reduced (Fig. 2G). Thus, CD24 protects against AAPinduced lethal hepatoxicity by dampening the immune response against HMGB1. HMGB1 can be divided into two domains: an inhibitory A box and a stimulatory B box (17). To determine whether CD24 inhibits HMGB1 by binding to the inhibitory A box, we produced deletion mutants lacking either the A box or the B box. CD24-Fc immunoprecipitated full-length HMGB1 and the box B­containing mutant, but not the box A­containing mutant (fig. S2). Thus, inhibition of HMGB1 by CD24 does not require direct interaction with box A. CD24 has no known mechanism for signal transduction. To understand how CD24 negatively regulates HMGB1, we searched for a potential CD24 receptor that may transduce signals downstream of CD24. We were particularly interested in sialic acid­ binding immunoglobulin (Ig)-like lectins (Siglecs), which are cell surface receptors of the immunoglobulin superfamily that recognize sialic acid­containing proteins (18). Siglecs are primarily expressed by cells of hematopoietic origin (18). Most Siglecs are considered to be negative regulators of the immune system because they contain one or more cytosolic immune receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) (18). To determine whether CD24 interacts with Siglecs, we incubated splenocytes on plates coated with the recombinant extracellular domains of ITIM-containing Siglec-5, -7, -10 or -11. Siglec10, but not Siglecs -5, -7, or -11, bound to CD24 (Fig. 3A). Flow cytometric analysis indicated that
