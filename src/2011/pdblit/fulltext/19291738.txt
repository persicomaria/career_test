ABSTRACT The multiple solvent crystal structures (MSCS) method uses organic solvents to map the surfaces of proteins. It identifies binding sites and allows for a more thorough examination of protein plasticity and hydration than could be achieved by a single structure. The crystal structures of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNAse A) soaked in the following organic solvents are presented: 50% dioxane, 50% dimethylformamide, 70% dimethylsulfoxide, 70% 1,6-hexanediol, 70% isopropanol, 50% R,S,R-bisfuran alcohol, 70% t-butanol, 50% trifluoroethanol, or 1.0M trimethylamine-N-oxide. This set of structures is compared with four sets of crystal structures of RNAse A from the protein data bank (PDB) and with the solution NMR structure to assess the validity of previously untested assumptions associated with MSCS analysis. Plasticity from MSCS is the same as from PDB structures obtained in the same crystal form and deviates only at crystal contacts when compared to structures from a diverse set of crystal environments. Furthermore, there is a good correlation between plasticity as observed by MSCS and the dynamic regions seen by NMR. Conserved water binding sites are identified by MSCS to be those that are conserved in the sets of structures taken from the PDB. Comparison of the MSCS structures with inhibitor-bound crystal structures of RNAse A reveals that the organic solvent molecules identify key interactions made by inhibitor molecules, highlighting ligand binding hot-spots in the active site. The present work firmly establishes the relevance of information obtained by MSCS.

INTRODUCTION The multiple solvent crystal structures (MSCS) method was first published in 1996 as an experimental method for locating and characterizing protein binding sites for potential use in ligand design.1 The crystal structures of Subtilisin2 and Elastase3 in neat acetonitrile had unexpectedly revealed that the protein was far from solvated by its organic solvent host, but rather retained a substantial first hydration shell with only a few molecules of the solvent bound primarily in the active site. This observation led to the idea that by soaking a protein in several distinct organic solvents and superimposing the resulting structures, the bound organic solvent molecules would reveal the shape and chemical complementarity in the active site that could then be used to develop functional groups in a larger ligand. The idea of linking fragments to produce more potent ligands has its origins in earlier pioneering work4 and was at the time also being explored by NMR, not with organic solvents, but with small solutes in aqueous solution.5 The approach of screening large numbers of small solute molecules has contributed with some degree of success to pharmaceutical research, combining both Xray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy in fragment-based lead discovery and drug design.6 The MSCS method is currently being developed as a powerful tool to experimentally locate and determine fundamental properties of protein binding sites.7,8 It has also played a role in the development of computational solvent mapping (CS-Map), an in silico counterpart to MSCS used to locate hot-spots for protein-ligand interactions.9­11 Results from other computational methods, such as multiple copy simultaneous search (MCSS) that aim to place chemical functional groups in protein active sites, have been compared to those of experimental MSCS data sets.12­14 Thus, MSCS has played an important role in the synergy that exists between experimental and computational strategies that aim to predict and understand protein-binding sites and it is currently viewed as a powerful experimental method to identify hot spots for protein­ ligand interactions.15 MSCS has been shown to correctly locate the known substrate binding sites for both Elastase16 and Thermolysin.12,17 With the structures

of many proteins preceding their biological and biochemical characterization, the ability to locate binding sites on proteins has become one of the challenges in structural biology. This problem has preoccupied many structure prediction and protein bioinformatics groups, resulting in a variety of computational methods for binding site prediction and characterization, with various degrees of success.18­21 MSCS is unique however, not only because it is an experimental method, but also because in addition to locating binding sites with the organic solvent probes it provides a picture of hydration and plasticity on the entire surface of the protein.8,22 To date, however, the patterns of clustering of organic solvent molecules, plasticity and hydration have been analyzed only qualitatively by MSCS. In the present article, we use the very well-studied protein bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNAse A) in a detailed MSCS analysis that can be compared with information accumulated over 40 years of structural biology research on this protein to establish more quantitatively the extent to which physical and chemical properties of protein surfaces are captured by MSCS. What aspects of ligand binding does MSCS predict? Do the trends and range in plasticity obtained from MSCS reflect those obtained from the over 100 RNAse A structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) that have been solved in aqueous solution from various crystalline environments and bound to countless inhibitors? Do the plasticity trends reflect the qualitative features obtained by solution NMR? Are water molecules conserved in the MSCS set the same as those conserved in the large number of structures solved in aqueous solution? In short, the goal of this study is to provide an assessment of how well the MSCS set reflects the properties of RNAse A in aqueous solution, delineating the strengths and limitations inherent in the method. This is an important step in defining how the MSCS method can be used to understand the details of protein surfaces in general and binding sites in particular. RNAse A catalyzes the breakdown of 30 50 -phosphodiester linkages in single stranded RNA at the 30 side of pyrimidine nucleotides. It uses an acid-base mechanism in which H12 and H119 play a central role. A review of the structure, function, and catalytic mechanism of RNAse A provides an excellent summary for decades of work on this enzyme.23 The plasticity and hydration features obtained by MSCS are compared in the present work with those published in a set of eight structures which encompasses two different crystal forms,24 and a partially-overlapping set of nine structures representing four crystal forms.25 None of the crystal forms found in these two crystallographic studies of RNAse A include the form which we used for the MSCS work.26 Thus, we also include a comparison set consisting of a group of inhibitor-bound structures from the same crystal form as used for MSCS. In addition, the plasticity captured by MSCS is compared to that observed in the NMR structure con-

sisting of 32 models deposited in the PDB.27 For the assessment of how well the organic solvent probes reveal functional group binding sites for RNAse A we use 58 inhibitor-bound structures taken from the PDB. The published RNAse A structures in aqueous solution provide a diverse and robust set for assessment and validation of the MSCS results in terms of plasticity, hydration and identification of hot spots on protein surfaces.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Crystal growth, cross-linking, and solvent soaks

Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (type XII A) was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in de-ionized water for a final concentration of 30 mg/mL. A procedure similar to that described in Vitagliano et al.26 was used to remove the sulfate ion, which is normally found in the purchased RNAse A active site. Dialysis of the protein into buffers of increasing pH results in deprotonation of the two catalytic histidine residues, releasing the negatively charged sulfate molecule. RNAse A was first dialyzed against a 0.15M Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.2 at 48C for 24 h. The dialysis was repeated with a 0.15M TrisHCl buffer at pH 8.2, and subsequently with a 0.15M Tris-HCl buffer at pH 9.0, each for 24 h. The dialysis bag containing RNAse A was then transferred to fresh buffer at pH 9.0 and the pH was adjusted to 5.5 over 8 h by adding small aliquots of 1M HCl. In the final step, RNAse A protein was dialyzed over night into a 10 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 5.0 and concentrated to 12 mg/ mL. As in previous reports,26,28 RNAse A crystals were grown using hanging drop vapor diffusion at 188C with 10 lL drops containing half protein solution and half reservoir solution over a 500 lL reservoir. The reservoir solution contained 20 mM sodium citrate buffer at pH 5.0 and PEG4000 levels of 30% w/v, 32% w/v, or 35% w/ v. All crystallization drops resulted in high diffraction quality crystals after 5 months. RNAse A crystals were manually transferred with a cryo-loop to a 10 lL drop of 0.08% glutaraldehyde (8.26% w/v in distilled water, pH 4.25, Electron Microscopy Sciences) in stabilization buffer (0.15M HEPES, pH 7.5, 32% w/v PEG 4000) over a 300 lL reservoir (the same glutaraldehyde-stabilization buffer as the drop) and the crosslinking reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 min. Crosslinked crystals were then transferred with a cryo-loop to new drops containing stabilization buffer and an organic solvent and allowed to soak for 1­2 h at room temperature. Soaked crystals were then collected, cryo-protected by dunking in stabilization buffer containing 20% glycerol, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Assessment of MSCS with RNAse A Structures

Data collection, processing, structure refinement

Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the SER° CAT ID-22 beamline at APS (Argonne, IL) using 1.0 A wavelength radiation and a Mar300 CCD detector at a crystal to detector distance of 100 mm. The data were processed and scaled using HKL2000.29 A published model of RNAse A (PDB code 1JVT) with the water molecules removed was used to calculate the initial electron density maps for all models of RNAse A. The models were refined with CNS.30 The program Coot31 was used to manually rebuild the models and to identify water and organic solvent molecules using the Fo 2 Fc electron density maps contoured at 3r and the 2Fo 2 Fc electron density maps contoured at 1r. Solvent molecules were added based on well-defined electron density, with no cutoff on B-factors or distances to H-bonding groups on the protein. All B-factors were initially set to 20 A3. Group B-factor refinement of the protein atoms was followed by individual B-factor refinement in all subsequent cycles, including refinement after the addition of water and organic solvent molecules. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table I. Average Bfactors are given separately for protein atoms, water molecules and organic solvent molecules. Average B-factors are particularly high for the dioxane and trifluoroethanol molecules (Table I). However, they have been left in the models due to the presence of electron density in final omit map calculations. Overall the high B-factors indicate either elevated disorder or low occupancy of the site and it is recognized that binding positions for dioxane and trifluoroethanol molecules in the active site bear less weight than the other organic solvent molecules in the MSCS analysis that follows. The RNAse A crystals have symmetry of space group C2 and have two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit. These molecules are designated as chain A and chain B in the coordinates deposited in the PDB and will be referred to as protein chain or molecule A and B.
Water renumbering

water positions was compiled from all of the MSCS structures to create a consensus list with assigned numbers, which was then used as the template to renumber the water molecules in each structure. This consensus list was generated by first including all water molecules ° located within 5 A of molecule A of the crosslinked structure in aqueous solution as unique water binding ° positions. Next, all water molecules located within 5 A of molecule B of the same structure were compared with the consensus list of unique water binding sites. Water molecules from this structure that were found within ° 1.4 A of a water position on the consensus list were not added as representing a unique site; however, the water position from the consensus list was averaged with the position of the comparison water molecule resulting in an average water position in the consensus list. Water molecules associated with chain B that were not located ° within 1.4 A of a water molecule on the consensus list were added to the list as unique water binding sites. This process was repeated until the consensus list was populated with average unique water binding positions from molecules A and B of all 10 MSCS structures. For the final renumbering, water molecules associated with molecules A and B from the MSCS structures were each assigned the number of the closest average position in the consensus list. These coordinates were used for the analysis presented in this article. For final PDB deposition molecules A and B in the asymmetric unit of each of the structures were superimposed back onto their positions in the refined coordinate file using the least squares superposition in Coot. Water molecules associated with protein chain A were included in chain C and water molecules associated with protein chain B were included in chain D. A number of water molecules had been duplicated because they were located at the interface between protein chains A and B, within ° 5 A of both molecules in the asymmetric unit. These water molecules were included only in chain C. The final coordinates deposited in the PDB are those resulting from one last round of refinement with CNS after merging of the files with the renumbered water molecules.
Comparison of MSCS with RNAse A structures from the PDB

The water molecules in the MSCS models were renumbered for consistency. Because of the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit, each of the 10 crystallographic coordinate files was divided into two files: one for each RNAse A molecule and the associated water and ° organic solvent molecules within 5 A of the protein. The resulting monomers were then superimposed using least squares superposition of the entire protein main chain atoms. Molecule A from the crosslinked RNAse A structure in aqueous solution was used as the reference structure. For the analysis of surface hydration it is important for water molecules at a particular site in any of the MSCS structures to have the same residue number in all the coordinate files. For this purpose, a unique set of

The SAS tool32 was used via the European Bioinformatics Institute website to probe the Protein Data Bank (PDB)33 for models of RNAse A with 100% sequence identity to the published model with PDB code 1JVT. Four sets of RNAse A models were downloaded from the PDB for comparison with the RNAse A MSCS structures. Most represent structures solved in aqueous solution and serve to assess whether results from the MSCS in organic solvents correspond to those observed from structures solved in an aqueous environment. These files were grouped into the following sets for analysis:

Assessment of MSCS with RNAse A Structures

1. RNAse A in complex with inhibitor molecules solved from crystals with symmetry of the C2 space group (Supporting Information Table sI) (referred to as the C2-inhibitor set throughout this article). The structures in this set were obtained from crystals isomorphous with the crystals used to obtain the MSCS set. It consists of 18 models with the following PDB codes: 1AFK, 1AFL, 1EOS, 1JN4, 1JVU, 1O0F, 1O0H, 1O0M, 1O0N, 1O0O, 1QHC, 1W4O, 1W4P, 1W4Q, 1WBU, 1Z6D, 1Z6S, and 2G8R. 2. RNAse A in complex with inhibitor molecules solved from crystals with symmetry of the following six space groups: C2, P21, P212121, P3121, P3221, P41212 (Supporting Information Table sI) (referred to as the allinhibitor set throughout this article). This set of 37 structures includes the 18 models in the C2-inhibitor set and have the following PDB codes: 1AFK, 1AFL, 1EOS, 1EOW, 1JN4, 1JVU, 1O0F, 1O0H, 1O0M, 1O0N, 1O0O, 1QHC, 1RAR, 1RAS, 1RBJ, 1RCA, 1RCN, 1RNC, 1RND, 1RNM, 1RNN, 1ROB, 1RPF, 1RPG, 1RSM, 1RTA, 1RUV, 1U1B, 1W4O, 1W4P, 1W4Q, 1WBU, 1Z6D, 1Z6S, 2G8R, 8RSA, and 9RSA. 3. Models included in the Sadasivan study24 consist of eight RNAse A structures, all of which were obtained from crystals with symmetry of space group P21, with one exception (PDB code 1RPH), for which crystals were obtained with P3221 symmetry. The PDB codes for structures in this set are: 7RSA, 5RSA, 3RN3, 1RHB, 1RHA, 1RPH, 1XPT, and 1XPS. This study presents a detailed analysis of plasticity in RNAse A. 4. Models included in the Zegers study25 consist of nine RNAse A structures from crystals with symmetry of the four space groups P21, P212121, P3121, and P3221. The PDB codes for this set are: 1RPG, 1ROB, 7RSA, 1RPH, 1RPF, 4SRN, 1RSM, 8RSA, and 2RNS. The Zegers set has two structures in common with the Sadasivan set: 1RPH and 7RSA. An extensive crystallographic water analysis was done in this study. 5. Solution NMR structure of RNAse A27 consists of a total of 32 models deposited with PDB code 2AAS. This file was separated into 32 individual coordinate files - one for each model. It is acknowledged that an ensemble of structures obtained by NMR is comprised of coordinates whose positions are consistent with NOE values and other constraints used in the NMR structure detemination. They do not represent individual conformers present in the structure. However, the set of NMR coordinates can delineate areas of larger divergence in the ensemble that correlate with areas of greater protein dynamics and conformational accessibility.34 The approach of separating the 32 individual coordinate files, although somewhat artificial, serves to provide an assessment of conformational range that can be compared directly to the sets of crystal structures represented in this study.

The models taken from the PDB and the MSCS models were superimposed using least squares backbone superposition of the entire protein chain using the program Coot. Molecule A from the crosslinked RNAse A in aqueous solution was used as the reference structure. In the cases where there were two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit, the PDB files were divided into two as described for the MSCS set: one for each monomer and the associated water, inhibitor, and ° organic solvent molecules within 5 A of the protein. Each model was then superimposed with the rest of the ensemble.
Computational analysis

Quantitative structural analysis was performed on the superimposed models of the structures downloaded from the PDB and on the MSCS structures to explore the parameters of (i) plasticity, (ii) conserved water molecules and (iii) superposition between organic solvents and inhibitor functional groups. A series of calculations and corresponding analysis was done independently on the MSCS and on the five sets of structures described in the previous section: the C2-inhibitor set, the all-inhibitor set, the Sadasivan set, the Zegers set, and the NMR structures. 1. Plasticity: A script was written in Perl to calculate the main chain RMSD per residue, between each pair of structures. The RMSD was calculated as RMSD2 ¼ f
n X i¼1

½ðx2;i À x1;i Þ2 þ ðy2;i À y1;i Þ2 þ ðz2;i À z1;i Þ2 g=n

where i is the atom type in each residue (N, CA, C, and O) and n is the number of atoms per residue (4 for the main chain). The highest RMSD, lowest RMSD, and average of all calculated pairwise RMSD values were then plotted for each residue. This was done for the MSCS set as well as for the five sets of structures in aqueous solution outlined in the previous section. The all atom pairwise RMSD per residue was also calculated. The plots showed the same trends as seen for the main chain RMSDs but with a higher level of fluctuation (noise) and therefore are not shown. 2. Conserved water molecules: The Structurally Equivalent Water System (SEWS) program35 was used to identify conserved water positions among the sets of structures. Water molecules were identified as belonging to the same cluster if their positions were within ° 1.4 A of a calculated peak of atom density. Conserved water positions were identified as clusters of water molecules having at least one common interaction ° with the protein within a distance cut-off of 3.4 A. It was found that an interaction distance of less than ° 3.4 A missed water molecules, where a greater value

didn't significantly improve the performance of the ° program. A radius of 1.4 A prevented two water molecules from a given structure being grouped in the same cluster while limiting the number of water molecules from different structures that should be clustered together but end up in two distinct groups. Once water clusters were determined with these parameters, a water molecule was considered conserved when present in at least 80% of the structures in the set. The NMR structures were not included in this analysis because these models contain no water molecules. 3. Organic solvents and inhibitor functional groups: A script was written in Perl to calculate the distances between the atom positions in the organic solvents and corresponding atom positions in the inhibitors. The distance was calculated as Distance2 ¼ ðx2 À x1 Þ2 þ ðy2 À y1 Þ2 þ ðz2 À z1 Þ2 ° Using a cut-off of 1.0 A with atoms of the same type (e.g. carbon and carbon), areas of overlap were identified

between organic solvents in the MSCS structures and inhibitor atoms in the inhibitor-bound structures.

RESULTS RNAse A is composed of 124 amino acid residues with eight cysteines, all of which are involved in disulfide bonds shown to be critical for structural stability.36 The structure is dominated by a b-sheet and there are three short a-helices. The b-sheet folds into two lobes (domains A and B) with the active site cleft situated between them [Fig. 1(A)]. Domain A is defined as residues 1­13, 49­79, and 105­124, and Domain B consists of residues 16­46, and 82­101. Residues 14­15, 47­48, 80­81, and 102­104 form the hinge connecting the two lobes.24,37 As an enzyme, RNAse A is an endoribonuclease that functions in the degradation of RNA (EC 3.1.27.5). It catalyzes the breakdown of 30 50 -phosphodiester linkages in single stranded RNA at the 30 side of pyrimidine nucleotides. Cleavage of the P-O50 bond occurs by acid-base catalysis in two steps: a transphos-

As shown in Figure 1(B), the active site has well defined subsites for the nucleotide bases on either side of the scissile bond and a less well-defined site for a second base on the 30 end (B1, B2, and B3 respectively); phosphate moieties bind in the P0, P1, and P2 subsites, where P1 is the site of cleavage.23 The phosphate group containing the scissile bond in the P1 subsite is braced on one side by the catalytic base (H12) and on the other by the catalytic acid (H119). Residues Q11, K41, and D121 also play a role in catalysis.38 Figure 1(B) shows the overall arrangement of the active site of RNAse A and depicts key interactions between active site residues and bound ligands.
RNAse A MSCS models

RNAse A crystals grown in aqueous solution, with symmetry of space group C2, were crosslinked with glutaraldehyde and transferred to one of a variety of solutions containing high concentrations of organic solvents. This resulted in 10 structures, each with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Table I shows the data collection and refinement statistics, and the PDB codes for the MSCS models. In addition to crosslinked RNAse A in aqueous solution (XLINK), the crystal structures were solved in the following conditions: 50% dioxane (DIO), 50% dimethylformamide (DMF), 70% dimethylsulfoxide (DMS), 70% 1,6-hexanediol (HEZ), 70% isopropanol (IPA), 50% R,S,R-bisfuranol (RSF), 70% t-butanol (TBU), 50% trifluoroethanol (ETF), and 1M trimethylamine N-oxide (TMO). A structure of RNAse A soaked in 50% S,R,S-bisfuranol did not reveal any bound organic solvent molecule and is therefore not included in this study. Electron density was poor or missing for the side chains of K1, K31, K37, D38, R39, K91, and K98 in both molecules of the asymmetric unit in all 10 structures [Fig. 1(A)]. These residues are on the surface of RNAse A either in loops or at the very ends of secondary structural elements and are also disordered in structures solved in an aqueous environment.24 The side chains for these residues were modeled as common rotamers, using care to avoid steric hindrance with neighboring residues. The one exception is K1 in the DMF model, which was removed from molecule A due to lack of electron density for the entire residue. Additionally, the region containing residues 16­22, which corresponds to the loop between the first two helices, has poor density, and residues were removed from each structure when there was no electron density to support their placement. Residues were removed from the models as follows: XLINK and HEZ, 19 and 20 from molecule A; DMS and TMO, 21 from molecule B; DIO, 18­20 from molecule A, 18­21 from

molecule B; DMF, 17­20 from molecule A, 18­21 from molecule B; IPA, 17­20 from molecule A; RSF, 17 and 21 from molecule A; TBU, 19­21 from molecule A, 17­21 from molecule B; and ETF, 18­21 from molecule A, 18 and 21 from molecule B. As observed previously, H119 is found in one of two conformations, A or B.25,39 In conformation A H119 interacts with D121 in what is considered the active form of the enzyme. In this conformation, the aromatic ring of the histidine stacks with the purine base of the substrate in the B2 pocket, whereas one of its nitrogen atoms donates a proton to the leaving group in the first part of the cleavage reaction. The MSCS models presented here have H119 in conformation A alone, or show clear electron density for both conformations A and B, depending on the solvent conditions (Table I). The prevalence of conformation A in the MSCS structures is not surprising given that this conformation has been shown to be the preferred one in aqueous organic solvent crystallization solutions whereas conformation B is the dominant form in ionic salt crystallization solutions.40
Analysis of plasticity based on pairwise RMSD values between the models

Each MSCS model was divided into two files, which separated the two protein molecules found in the asymmetric unit and their associated water and organic solvent molecules, and resulted in 20 crystallographically independent models of RNAse A in 10 different solvent environments. All the protein molecules from the MSCS models were then superimposed as described in the Materials and Methods section. Previous studies have shown by visual inspection that the comparison of the MSCS models of Elastase reveal subtle changes in side chain conformation due to different solvent environments.8 In RNAse A, significant plasticity has been previously observed and analyzed in detail in the Sadasivan study,24 which uses a set of structures solved in aqueous solution (see Materials and Methods section). In the present study, the pairwise RMSD per residue is calculated for all of the structures in the MSCS set as well as for structures in each of the five sets taken from the PDB for comparison. The goal is to quantify plasticity in each set and to assess the correspondence between plasticity results determined from MSCS and those obtained from an aqueous environment. Figure 2(A) shows a plot of the average pairwise RMSD for main chain atoms in the MSCS set for each of the 124 residues in RNAse A. The highest and lowest pairwise RMSD values are also included for each residue to indicate the range of plasticity per residue within the set. In Figures 2(B­F) the plots in Figure 2(A) are superimposed on corresponding plots calculated from the five comparison data sets. The MSCS set shows peaks and valleys in the RMSD plots that correspond primarily to the loop regions and

ordered secondary structures (a-helices and b-strands), respectively. The areas of high average RMSD's in the MSCS set are areas described in the Sadasivan study as having high plasticity and are more prominent in domain B than in A.24 The hinge region has low average ° backbone RMSD values ranging from 0.12 to 0.29 A, with the exception of H48, which has an average back° bone RMSD value of 0.57 A. H48 lies adjacent to the loop region 16­22, which is disordered in the MSCS

structures. This disorder is propagated to H48, allowing for more variation in structure. With the exception of K1 ° (average RMSD of 1.79 A), which is highly disordered in virtually all known structures of RNAse A, all of the highest RMSD values fall within Domain B. Excluding K1, the maximum average RMSD in Domain A is found ° for N113 at 0.63 A. Eight residues in Domain B have average RMSD values higher than that of N113 (T17, 1.17 ° ° ° ° ° A; A19, 0.90 A; A20, 0.82 A; S21, 1.6 A; K37, 0.68 A;

° ° ° ° D38, 0.86 A; G88, 0.96A; S89, 1.0 A; and S90, 0.72 A). Most of these residues are in loop regions with high B-factors in the models. Overall, the hinge region contains the highest concentration of residues with a low average backbone RMSD, followed by Domain A and Domain B, respectively. In general, the active site residues shown in Figure 1(B) have relatively low average backbone RMSD values. In the P1 pocket, Q11, H12, and H119 all have values at ° ° ° ° or below 0.2 A RMSD (0.17 A, 0.14 A, and 0.20 A, respectively). D121, which stabilizes the catalytic confor° mation of H119, has a RMSD value of 0.21A. K41 has the highest value of the residues of the P1 pocket with an ° average RMSD of 0.31 A. In the B1 pocket, both T45 and ° ° D83 have low values of 0.14 A and 0.19 A, respectively, whereas S123, in the distal part of B1 relative to the P1 ° pocket, has a somewhat higher value of 0.28 A. Both N71 and E111 of the B2 pocket have average RMSD val° ° ues of 0.30 A and 0.32 A, respectively, and K66 of P0 has the highest average RMSD of the active site residues at ° 0.47 A. The average backbone RMSDs across the MSCS structures highlight the residues of the active site that remain rigid upon ligand binding and those that adjust to improve the interaction. In general, residues in the P0 and B2 pockets further removed from the catalytic center, and S123 at the top of B1, show greater plasticity (or potential for adjustment) than residues in P1 immediately adjacent to the scissile bond and those in and B1 most near the catalytic center. The trends in plasticity observed in the MSCS set are representative of the trends revealed in all six plots in Figure 2. In all cases it is clear that domain B shows a significantly higher degree of plasticity as previously observed24 and overall the areas of greater plasticity are the same in all six data sets. The details change in going from one plot to another in Figure 2 and interesting differences between the various sets of structures are reflected in the magnitude of the average RMSD per residue and in the range given by the low and high RMSD values. The set most closely related to the MSCS set in our study is the C2-inhibitor set, as the structures were obtained from isomorphous crystals. Any difference in the RMSD plots between the MSCS set and the C2inhibitor set is likely due to the solvent environment and this is the comparison most relevant in assessing whether MSCS can reflect the changes in structure that are represented in an aqueous environment. Figure 2(B) shows the average, high and low RMSDs per residue for the MSCS set in black lines and those for the C2-inhibitor set in gray. The average and low RMSDs for the two sets superimpose very well, with no significant areas of deviation. The high RMSDs follow similar trends, although with somewhat greater variability between the two sets. Residue 66, an active site lysine found in the P0 pocket, is an exception to the overall similar trend in the high RMSD values, with that of the C2-inhibitor set [gray

dotted line in Figure 2(B)] showing a significantly higher ° ° value than in the MSCS set (2.9 A and 1.7 A, respectively). This is due to a single inhibitor structure (PDB code 1O0F) where, in molecule B of the asymmetric unit, residues 65­67 were built with an altered backbone conformation. Excluding this one molecule from the set results in much closer agreement between the high RMSD values for that region in the two data sets [compare the black and gray lines with squares in Figure 2(B)]. Figure 2(C) shows a comparison between the MSCS set and the all-inhibitor set, which contains the effects of six different crystal environments. Because of the fact that molecule B of the 1O0F model dominates the high RMSD values, it was removed from the RMSD calculations in Figure 2(C), but its inclusion results in a peak at residues 65­70 similar to that shown by the dotted line in Figure 2(B). In the case of the all-inhibitor set the trends in average RMSDs are again very similar to those observed for the MSCS sets, except around residues 66 and 93, where the all-inhibitor set shows higher RMSD averages. Unlike the case for the C2-inhibitor set, however, the high RMSDs for the all-inhibitor set is overall higher than for the MSCS set. This is a reflection of the fact that, in this set, RNAse A structures solved in six distinct crystallographic space groups are superimposed and compared to each other. The high RMSDs reflect comparisons between the most different structures derived from crystals having distinct constraints due to crystal contacts. The Sadasivan set provides an opportunity to directly compare the plasticity of structures solved from crystals with symmetries of two distinct space groups. The MSCS models were from crystals with symmetry of the C2 space group and all but one of the structures (PDB code 1RPH) in the Sadasivan set were derived from crystals with P21 symmetry. Figure 2(D) shows the RMSD plots of the MSCS set superimposed on those for the Sadasivan set with the 1RPH model removed. Although the average RMSD values per residue are very similar for the two sets, there are six regions where they differ significantly. The first three include residues for which the average RMSDs in the MSCS set are larger than those in the Sadasivan set. Residues 16­20 are in a region of disorder in structures derived from crystals with symmetry of the C2 space group (MSCS set) while in the P21 form this is a region of crystal contacts (Sadasivan set). Residue 48 lies beneath residues 16­20, and consequently it is stabilized by the crystal contacts affecting residues 16­20. Residues 88­90 are also near crystal contacts in the Sadasivan set, but not in the MSCS set. There are another three regions for which the reverse is true: residues 32­36, 91­94, and 123­124 are stabilized by crystal contacts in the MSCS set, but not in the Sadasivan set, resulting in higher average RMSD values for these residues in the latter. These trends are observed much more dramatically when considering the high RMSD values in

both sets, but the overall differences are due similarly to the distinct areas of crystal contacts found in the C2 and P21 crystal forms. Sadasivan et al.24 identified residues 14­15, 25­30, 46­48, 50, 52­61, 63, 72­75, 80­84, 97­ 100, 102­112, and 116­120 as areas of low plasticity based on analysis of the RNAse A molecules in their study. All of these residues, with the exception of 48 and 88­90 which are stabilized by crystal contacts in the P21 but not in the C2 form, have the lowest average RMSDs in the MSCS set as well. The Zegers study25 focused primarily on analysis of conserved water molecules, but they did note that between 1RPH and 1RPF (both of the P3221 space group), the differences were found primarily in the regions of 19­23 and 87­91. Additionally, among the three structures of 1RPH, 1RPF, and 1RPG (from crystals with P21 symmetry), the differences were observed in the regions of 35­42, 65­71, and 88­96. When the average RMSDs obtained from the Zegers set are compared to those of the MSCS structures, seven regions of differences are highlighted [Fig. 2(E)]. Three of these regions, 16­22, 48, 93­94 have the same explanation for their differences as between the MSCS structures and the Sadasivan set of structures, that is, they are due to differences in crystal contacts. Residues 24, 113, and 124 are stabilized by crystal contacts in the MSCS structures and show lower average RMSDs than in the Zegers set. In the Zegers structures the crystal packing varies for these residues, allowing for a greater range of conformations to be adopted across the set as reflected in the higher RMSD values. The final region, residues 11­13, adopts a greater range of conformation in the Zegers set. This is due the 8RSA structure, in which His12 is covalently modified, resulting in a shift in residues 11­13 relative to the rest of the models. The 32 NMR models from PDB ID 2AAS27 were considered individually and the RMSD values were calculated and plotted as was done with the MSCS models. When the RMSD plot of the NMR models was compared to the plot for the MSCS models, the overall trends were again the same [Fig. 2(F)]. The NMR models exhibited a larger range between the low and high RMSD values for each residue, and the average RMSD value per residue was consistently above that of the MSCS set. This is expected given the lack of crystal environment constraints in solution. Interestingly, the high RMSDs from the MSCS set are comparable to the average RMSD values in the NMR set. Areas that differ in trends between these two sets are those that have been previously noted to be in crystal contacts in the MSCS set: residues 16­22 and 48 have notoriously high RMSDs in the MSCS set due to poor electron density for model building in the C2 crystal form. Residues 33­34, 58­63, and 91­94 are in crystal contacts in the MSCS set but showed high plasticity in other crystal forms. It is therefore not surprising that these regions show higher RMSDs in the NMR set.

Overall, the plasticity described by RMSD calculations across the MSCS structures is similar in terms of location, but not magnitude, to plasticity seen in NMR structures. It is very similar in terms of both location and magnitude across a set of crystal structures encompassing a wider range of solvent and crystal environments. There appears to be no effect uniquely attributed to the organic solvent environments on the overall magnitude or trends in plasticity within the MSCS set.
Conserved water binding sites

With Multiple Solvent Crystal Structures a protein is observed in a diverse set of environments where the first hydration shell is the primary mediator between the protein and the bulk solvent.7 Thus, as the protein structure makes small adjustments in response to its environment, so do the accompanying water molecules, with the result that the MSCS models collectively sample far more hydration sites on the protein surface than are seen in any one structure (see Fig. 3). Within this collective set of crystallographic water molecules there is a fraction found in the same position in all of the structures.8 The question is whether these conserved water positions are representative of conserved crystallographic water in aqueous environments. The four RNAse A sets of crystal structures downloaded from the PDB, as described in the Materials and Methods section, serve as the test sets in this study to determine the relevance of conserved water positions derived from MSCS of RNAse A. As with the analysis of plasticity, these four sets allow comparison within the same crystallographic environment (C2-inhibitor set), within multiple crystallographic environments (all-inhibitor set), and with two studies that had previously determined conserved water molecules within smaller sets of structures (Sadasivan and Zegers sets). The latter two sets also provide a check for consistency between different methods used in the determination of conserved crystallographic water molecules. The conserved water binding sites in the present study were identified with the SEWS program using a previously published procedure based on the atom densities of water molecules at particular sites within a set of structures35 and parameters specified in the ``Materials and Methods'' section. Considering that many of the structures involved have two molecules in the asymmetric unit, there are 20 independent models in the MSCS set with a total of 2077 water molecules, 36 in the C2-inhibitor set with 5141 water molecules, 56 in the all-inhibitor set with 6948 water molecules, and 10 each in the Sadasivan and Zegers sets with 1353 and 1190 water molecules, respectively. A water-binding site was considered conserved within a set when occupied in at least 80% of the structures. This avoided bias from one or a few structures where there may not be a water molecule at a conserved posi-

tion for reasons such as bound organic solvents or crystal contacts. Table II shows the 31 conserved water binding sites within the MSCS set, the percent occupancy of each of those water positions in the other four sets, as well as the interactions with protein atoms. Of these, 14 are at least 80% conserved across all of the five sets of structures based on the SEWS analysis as described earlier (see Table II for the identity of these water molecules). There are 22 conserved water positions in the C2-inhibitor set of structures obtained from crystals isomorphous to those used for MSCS. Interestingly, the majority of the nine water molecules found to be conserved in MSCS but not in the C2-inhibitor set are found in crystal contacts in both sets, but at 65­75% in the latter, not quite making the cutoff of 80%. Furthermore, of the 22 conserved water positions in the C2-inhibitor set 19 are identified by MSCS. The three remaining water molecules are found in Table III, which lists water-binding sites that were conserved in one or more of the comparison sets, but not in the MSCS set. Two of the three water molecules are in the B1 pocket where they are often displaced by organic solvents in the MSCS set (60 and 153) and one is at the interface between molecules A and B (Wat 44). In the MSCS set Wat 44 is 100% conserved in molecule B, but it is only found associated with molecule A in three of the 10 structures. There are 18 conserved water positions in the all-inhibitor set, all but two of which are also observed to be conserved in the MSCS set: Wat 153 and Wat 44 as explained for the C2-inhibi-

tor set. There are 31 conserved water binding sites in the Sadasivan set and 24 in the Zegers set. The majority of the conserved water binding sites in all five sets of structures are associated with domain A of RNAse A, with 87, 86, 83, 61, and 58% of the conserved water molecules associated with domain A in the MSCS, C2-inhibitor, allinhibitor, Sadasivan, and Zegers sets, respectively. Not surprisingly, the conserved water sites are in the areas of least plasticity in the structures (see Fig. 4). The most thorough crystallographic water analysis on RNAse A to date was done on the Zegers set of structures. The FIXWAT program41 was used to identify con° served water molecules as those located within 5 A of the ° protein and clustered in a sphere with a radius of 0.5 A within all structures in the set (100% conserved), except when covalent modifications precluded the binding of water.25 The Zegers study found 17 conserved water binding sites according to these criteria. The less strict 80% conservation criterion applied in the present study explains the additional seven conserved water binding sites obtained with SEWS. All but four of the 17 published conserved water molecules were found to be associated with one of the three a-helices in RNAse A, often linking it to a nearby b-strand.25 There are seven conserved water positions that link the N-terminal a-helix containing the active site residues Q11 and H12 to the C-terminal b-strand with residues H119 and F120 [Fig. 1(B)]. These water molecules were suggested to effectively stabilize the active site.25 These seven water molecules

a distorted structure for a-helix 3 and bridge it to a b-strand. Water molecules 6, 10, and 82 are found to be conserved by MSCS, but 282 is only 40% conserved (Table III). It is located in an area of crystal contacts in the MSCS structures and water molecules in this position are most commonly associated with a symmetry-related molecule (103 in chain C and 155 in chain D). Taking this into consideration, this water molecule is 80% conserved in the MSCS set. The remaining four water-binding sites published by Zegers et al.25 are on the protein surface. Two are identified by MSCS as conserved (64 and 318) and the remaining two are not (215 and 368). Wat 215 (Table III) is 100% conserved in the Zegers set, 70% conserved in the Sadasivan set, and less than 50% conserved in the MSCS and both the C2- and all-inhibitor sets. In molecule B of the C2 crystal form, the protein residue, Q101 packs against S16, and the Og group of this residue takes the place of Wat 215 in the MSCS and C2-inhibitor sets. This is not the case for molecule A, where Wat 215 is present in 80% of the MSCS structures, resulting in an overall conservation level of 40% when molecules A and B are taken together. Wat 318 is less than 50% conserved in all five sets of structures based on the SEWS analysis criteria. It is located in a position where it sometimes interacts with the backbone nitrogen of S18. Although it is found in this position in 80% of the structures in the Zegers set, it only interacts with the backbone nitrogen of S18 or with the Og group of the same residue in 30% and 20% of the structures, respectively. Wat 318 was found to be conserved by Zegers et al.25 because they did not use interaction with a common protein residue as one of their criteria for conserved water-binding sites. In the MSCS structures, this is in an area of disorder where water molecules were often not modeled. As similar disorder can be observed in structures of the C2-inhibitor set for residues 16­22, it is unlikely that in the MSCS structures the disorder is due to the effects of organic solvents. A conserved water analysis was also published for the Sadasivan set.24 In this study, a water site was taken as conserved if a bound water molecule made at least one ° interaction of 3.6 A or less with the protein in common in all structures belonging to the set and the distance ° between equivalent water molecules was 1.8 A or less 24,37 By these criteria there are 14 after superposition. invariant water binding sites identified by Sadasivan et al.,24 10 of which are found among the 17 invariant water-binding sites published by Zegers et al..25 The variation in conserved water molecules between the Zegers and Sadasivan studies have been previously discussed24 and are in large part due to the differences in selection criteria and crystallographic environments between structures in the two studies. Of the 14 conserved water molecules published in the Sadasivan study 10 are also identified as conserved by MSCS and have the following numbers in Table II: 4, 6,

10, 18, 21, 39, 63, 64, 69, and 82. Water molecules 43, 163, and 282 appear on Table III because they are not conserved in the MSCS set but are identified as conserved elsewhere, including in the Sadasivan study. Wat 282 has already been discussed earlier because it was also found to be conserved in the Zegers study. Wat 43 is only found to be conserved in the Sadasivan set because there it often is involved in a H-bonding network across a crystal contact. In all four other sets, Wat 43 is around 50­60% conserved. Wat 163 is 50% conserved in the overall MSCS set. However, it is 100% conserved in molecule B of the asymmetric unit in the MSCS structures, but completely absent in molecule A due to a crystal contact that takes its place. In the C2-inhibitor set Wat 163 sometimes appears at the crystal contact associated with molecule A and thus it is 67% conserved in this isomorphous set of structures. Finally, Wat 291 is associated with residues 14, 16, and 17 in the Sadasivan set. It was added seldomly to the MSCS set of structures due to disorder in the 16­22 region as previously discussed and is therefore not included in Table II.
Water molecules in the active site

An analysis of water conservation in the active site is complicated by the fact that in many of the structures, including those in the MSCS set, there are other types of molecules associated with this area. Nevertheless, there are nine water-binding sites that appear frequently in all five sets of structures. Water molecules 22, 60, 153 are in the B1 pocket [Fig. 5(A)], 16, 19, 20 are in the P1 pocket [Fig. 5(B)], and 13, 14, and 34 are in the B2 pocket [Fig. 5(C)]. The water molecules bound in these nine waterbinding sites can be categorized as structural, bridging, or displaced based on their occurrence in the all-inhibitor set of structures (Table IV). Structural water molecules are not displaced by inhibitor molecules and form multiple hydrogen bonds with polar groups of the active site and other well-ordered water molecules. The bridging water molecules mediate interactions between the inhibitors and residues in the active site. Displaced water molecules are absent in the presence of inhibitors and their interactions with protein atoms are often mimicked by bound ligands. Water molecules 16 and 20 in the P1 pocket are better than 80% conserved in all five sets of crystal structures in this study and can be classified as structural (Table IV). These water molecules participate in a hydrogenbonding network involving polar groups that line the pocket, and water molecule 19, when it is present [Fig. 5(B)]. This network is thought to contribute to the stability of the active site by connecting helix 1 to b-strand 6.25 Wat 16 forms hydrogen bonds to Q11 Ne2 (or Oe1, depending on the orientation of the side chain) and interacts with the phosphate moiety of inhibitors bound in the P1 pocket. Wat 20 hydrogen bonds to the back-

bone oxygen atoms of V118 and A4. The binding of inhibitors disrupts neither of these water molecules. Three other water molecules are also better than 80% conserved in the MSCS set: 13, 19, and 34. Wat 13 in the B2 pocket is conserved beyond the 80% cutoff in all but the Zegers set, where it is 70% conserved. It forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone nitrogen atoms of K66 and N67, with the D121 Od1 atom and with water molecule 14 in the absence of inhibitors [Fig. 5(C)]. Inhibitors bound in the B2 pocket displace Wat 14 and Wat 13 bridges the interaction between every inhibitor and K66, N67, and D121. Wat 13 is therefore in the bridging water category (Table IV). Wat 19 in the P1 pocket and Wat 34 in B2 are conserved in MSCS but not in any of the other sets where they are displaced by every inhibitor bound in the active site. Thus, like Wat 14, Wat 19, and 34 are in the displaced water category (Table IV). Wat 19 hydrogen bonds with Ne2 of the catalytic H12 and the backbone nitrogen of F120 and Wat 34 forms hydrogen bonds with N71 Nd2 and, when E111 is oriented to be within hydrogen bonding distance, either with the Oe1 or Oe2 group of E111 [Fig. 5(C)]. All of the inhibitors mimic these interactions. The three water molecules in the B1 pocket, 22, 60 and 153 are shown in Table III to be conserved in at least one of the four comparison sets and when the two molecules of the asymmetric unit of the MSCS structures are considered independently, all of these water molecules are at least 80% conserved in either molecule A or molecule B, but not both. Wat 22 interacts with T45 N and is displaced by every inhibitor bound to RNAse A, where functional groups can form a similar interaction with the T45 N atom [Fig. 5(A)]. It is therefore in the displaced water category, along with Wat 14, 19, and 34 (Table IV). Water molecule 60 interacts with S123 N and bridges a bound pyrimidine to this side chain in virtually all inhibitor-bound structures. Wat 153 interacts with D83 Od1, T45 Og1, and S123 Og [Figure 5(A)]. In inhibitor bound structures, it bridges a pyrimidine moiety to the active site residues D83 and S123. Water molecules 60 and 153 are both identified as changing their roles as hydrogen bond donors or acceptors depending on whether a uracil or cytosine is bound in the B1 pocket.42

The overall pattern of bound organic solvent molecules on the surface of RNAse A follows the expected trends previously observed for Elastase8 and Thermolysin.12 There is clustering of the small molecules in the active site and binding elsewhere on the surface occurs primarily in crystal contacts. Thirty-nine organic solvent molecules bind at the surface of RNAse A (see Fig. 6), occupying 23 unique binding sites, which are numbered consistently in the MSCS models as 901­923. Each of the 39 solvent molecules is listed in Supporting Information Table sII along with all the interactions it makes with the protein. Five of the molecules are found at the interface between RNAse A molecules A and B in the asymmetric unit, and were duplicated when the two protein molecules from each MSCS model were separated into individual files as described in the ``Materials and Methods'' section. Because of this duplication, a total of 44 solvent molecules are present in Supporting Information Table sII. An ``A'' or ``B'' is added to the duplicated organic solvent molecules in Supporting Information Table sII to identify whether the list of protein interactions that

follow are contributed by molecule A or B in the asymmetric unit. The present analysis focuses on the organic solvent molecules found in the active site. There are 14 such molecules found in four binding sites: two are located in the B1 pocket, one is in the P1 pocket, and one is in the B2 pocket. The position and mode of binding of the solvent molecules were analyzed with respect to how well they mimic the inhibitors found in the all-inhibitor set and their relationship to the nine active site water molecules discussed in the previous section. Organic molecules in the B1 pocket are found in sites 901 and 902 [Fig. 5(D)]. Site 901 contains a dioxane molecule (DIO 901) and a trifluoroethanol molecule (ETF 901), which make interactions primarily with the backbone N and Og atoms of S123. This site does not have the usual characteristics in that there are only two solvent probe representatives and they do not fully overlap within the site, that is, they do not truly cluster [Fig. 5(D)]. Furthermore, both the dioxane and trifluoroethanol molecules in this site have excessively high B-factors and their presence in the models must be taken in this context. Both DIO 901 and ETF 901 molecules displace the bridging water molecule 60, with O2 of dioxane and F1 of trifluorethanol mimicking the interaction that this water makes with the backbone N atom of S123. In addition, the hydroxyl group of ETF 901 makes a good H-bond with the side chain hydroxyl group of S123. Most of the inhibitor molecules do not bind at this site (although there are few exceptions as exemplified by model with PDB code 1Z6D) and instead interact with bridging water molecule Wat 60. A dimethylsulfoxide (DMS 902), isopropanol (IPA 902), and a second trifluoroethanol (ETF 902) tightly overlap to form cluster 902, with the main sites of interaction being the backbone N and Og1 of T45 as well as the side chain of F120. Cluster 902 overlaps with Wat 22, which is in the displaced water category. The DMS 902, IPA 902, and ETF 902 molecules bound at this site all sample the two H-bonding interactions made by purine or pyrimidine bases bound in the B1 pocket with the backbone N and Og atoms of T45. They also make van der Waal's contact with the side chain of F120, which normally interacts with bases bound in this pocket. Collectively, the organic solvents in the B1 pocket cluster 902, delineate key interactions made by all of the inhibitor molecules. Organic solvent cluster 903 is found in the P1 pocket of the active site [Fig. 5(E)]. It contains a trifluoroethanol (ETF 903), an isopropanol (IPA 903), a t-butanol (TBU 903), and two dioxane molecules (DIO 903 and DIO 993), which are associated with molecules B and A, respectively. These solvent molecules identify groups in the P1 site that are important for inhibitor or substrate binding. They mimic the interactions made by some of the phosphate oxygen atoms with H119 Nd1 and Q11

Ne2. However, none of the organic solvent molecules displace Wat 19, which is observed to be displaced by inhibitor (and presumably substrate) phosphate groups bound at the P1 pocket and by either phosphate or sulfate ions, highlighting the specificity of the pocket for the negatively charged functional group. The phosphate group makes many highly polar interactions with the protein, which cannot be fulfilled simultaneously by any of the organic solvent molecules used in the MSCS study. Instead, the organic solvent molecules bind to a site adjacent to the phosphate, overlapping the ribose group of the inhibitors and with polar functional groups mimicking one of the phosphate oxygen atoms and H-bonding to Wat 19. In the MSCS models, Wat 19 bridges the organic solvent molecules to H12, to the backbone N atom of F120, and to the structural water molecules 16 and 20. The B2 pocket contains organic solvent cluster 904, with two 1,6-hexanediol molecules (HEZ) and two dimethylsulfoxide molecules (DMS). As each of these solvent molecules is present in both molecules A and B in the asymmetric unit, they are numbered 904 and 994 respectively in the PDB coordinate sets. Essentially, all of the inhibitors have a purine ring in this pocket stacking over H119. The four organic solvent molecules mimic this interaction. In the superimposed structures, it is clear that the DMS 904 and 994 molecules, as well as the aliphatic portions of the HEZ 904 and 994 molecules, overlap with the plane of the inhibitor purine rings [Fig. 5(F)]. H119 in the apo enzyme can sample two conformations, A and B. Binding of a ligand in the B2 pocket excludes conformation B, securing the catalytically active conformation A. In addition to the stacking interaction with H119, solvent molecules in cluster 904 make polar interactions with N67 Nd1 and N71 Nd2, which are also found to be made by the inhibitors. The organic molecules do not H-bond to the Od1 atom of N71, an interaction present in most inhibitor-bound structures. The inhibitor-displaced water molecule Wat 14 is also displaced by all four organic solvent molecules found at this site, while the displaced Wat 34 is replaced by HEZ 904 and 994 but not by DMS 904 and 994. Interestingly, every H-bond interaction made by Wat 34 is also present between a hydroxyl group of each of the HEZ molecules bound in B2 and the corresponding protein residues. The same is true for Wat 13, even though it is a bridging water molecule that is 89% conserved in the all-inhibitor set (Table II).

DISCUSSION One of the powerful advantages of the MSCS method is that it simultaneously probes protein surfaces in terms of functional epitopes (or hot spots) and plasticity, providing a direct experimental analysis of essential features that are thought to be optimized together during the

evolution of protein binding sites.43 In addition, it facilitates an analysis of the hydration structure that must be displaced upon ligand binding.8 The analysis presented in this study treats plasticity, hydration and clustering of organic solvents in separate sections, each containing relevant information from previous sections. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the nature of a binding event will involve all of these features simultaneously.
Protein plasticity

between areas of high plasticity as observed by MSCS and by solution NMR: the loops that link elements of secondary structure exhibit high RMSD values compared to residues involved in the helices or the b-sheet, with the greater plasticity previously observed for domain B clearly reflected in the MSCS results. The MSCS set was also able to distinguish between the plasticity of active site residues, with those in the P1 and B1 pockets near the catalytic center showing significantly less plasticity than residues in either the P0 or B2 pockets in more distal parts of the active site.
Hydration

Comparison of plasticity in the MSCS set with the C2inhibitor set shows no significant differences, consistent with the idea that collectively the organic solvents induce a range of conformations that is also observed in a set of structures solved in aqueous environments. In addition, residues that are disordered and show weak electron density in aqueous solution are also disordered in most organic solvent molecules, although as previously observed the most hydrophobic solvents, such as hexanediol, can improve order due to a relative increase in the energy of H-bonds to the organic solvent compared to that with water, favoring H-bonding interactions between protein atoms.44 The important observation here is that even though any given solvent may have particular effects on the protein structure, the areas on the protein that adapt to changes in the organic solvent environment are the same as those observed in a series of independently solved structures in the same crystal form adjusting to various conditions of temperature, bound ligand, pH, etc. Analogously, a given pH will have a particular effect on a protein structure, but the favored conformation is one in a range of accessible forms that can be stabilized by changes in pH and other parameters affecting the protein environment.40 In essence, the present study supports the idea that plasticity may be assessed as well by changes in organic solvent environments as by other types of perturbations such as pH, temperature, ionic strength and relative humidity typically used in an aqueous environment.7 Although the C2-inhibitor set can be used directly to assess the MSCS method due to the isomorphous nature of the RNAse A crystals, the other three comparison sets show the effects of crystal contacts. In comparison with the Sadasivan set, differences in the RMSD per residue are localized exclusively to the areas where there are crystal contacts in one of the C2 or P21 crystal forms but not in the other, whereas the Zegers and the all-inhibitor sets represent structures from various crystal forms and thus show a more complicated pattern of changes in plasticity, including larger ranges of RMSD values at sites of crystal contacts. Details due to crystal contacts aside, however, the general locations of high and low plasticity were found to be the same for the MSCS set as for all of the comparison sets derived from crystal structures. Furthermore, there was excellent qualitative agreement

The present work includes a comprehensive analysis of conserved water binding sites found in the MSCS of RNAse A and in the four groups of RNAse A crystal structures downloaded from the PDB. In spite of some variation in the criteria used for defining a conserved water binding site in this and previous studies,24,25 the results are remarkably similar. Importantly, the deviations in location and numbers of conserved water binding sites found between the MSCS set and either the Sadasivan or the Zegers set are no more significant than the deviations found between the Zegers and Sadasivan sets. Furthermore, for each case where a difference is observed between two sets of structures there is a clear explanation that is not specific to the organic solvent environments used for the MSCS work, with the interesting exception of interfaces between two protein molecules in the crystal where the conserved site is not due to a water binding site in the native state of the protein, but due to crystal contacts. This effect can be most clearly observed in the comparison between conserved water binding sites in the MSCS and C2-inhibitor sets, which ideally would be expected to give the same results. Based on the SEWS analysis, there are 31 conserved water binding sites in the MSCS set and only 22 in the C2-inhibitor set. The difference is primarily due to the more prominent appearance of conserved water molecules in crystal contacts in the MSCS set, at the 80% conservation level, where those same crystal contact water molecules are present in the C2-inhibitor set at the 65­75% conservation level, not quite making the 80% cut-off. This may be a result of somewhat more favorable H-bonding interactions due to the organic solvent environment44 in crystal contacts where the relative position of two protein molecules, rather than the structure of the protein itself is the dominant factor in determining the conserved water binding site. Importantly, MSCS predicts the location of all conserved water molecules in the C2-inhibitor set, except those in the active site, which are displaced by organic solvent molecules in the MSCS structures. MSCS also does very well in identifying the water molecules described as conserved in the Zegers and Sadasivan sets, with the observed differences being due to differences in

crystal contacts in the various crystal forms being compared. There are nine active site water molecules, three in each of the B1, P1, and B2 pockets, found to be conserved in one or more of the five sets of crystal structures in this study. Superposition of these water binding sites onto the all-inhibitor set lead to their classification as structural, bridging or displaced as discussed in the Results section and shown in Table IV. This active site water classification was possible for the first time in this study because the large numbers of RNAse A crystal structures involved gave good representation of the liganded and unliganded forms of the enzymes, which was not the case in previous studies. The MSCS set alone was able to identify the nine water molecules as those that appeared in almost all crystal structures that did not have an organic solvent bound at the particular water binding site. In the case of Wat 153, examining molecule A and molecule B separately in the MSCS structures revealed that Wat 153 was conserved when the binding site was not disrupted as a result of crystal packing. The classification scheme, however, required comparison with the inhibitor-bound structures. Only four of the nine conserved water molecules in the active site are displaced by inhibitor molecules: Wat 22 in B1, Wat 19 in P1, Wat 14, and Wat 34 in B2. In each case, the hydrogen bonding interactions made by the displaced water molecule are closely mimicked by a functional group on the inhibitors, suggesting that the release of these water molecules may at least in part offset the entropic cost of ligand binding while maintaining the favorable enthalpic gains. There are other, less conserved water molecules in the active site for which this is probably not the case. The displaced conserved water binding sites should serve as clues to placement of polar functional groups in ligand design, where they would have the capability of mimicking the hydrogen bonding interactions of the water molecule with protein atoms.
Binding of organic solvents

ment libraries with compounds that, due to their inherently small size, have low binding affinity to the protein. Structure guided ligand design strategies can then be used to evolve a molecule to occupy the hot spots revealed by the fragments.45,46 The resulting molecules are of similar size as those commonly observed with high throughput screening, but make more efficient use of the available binding epitopes. Data base analysis of homologous protein families has shown that polar residues are essential components of hot spots and are often highly conserved at protein-ligand interfaces together with key areas of hydrophobic interaction.43,47 The study also makes clear that plasticity, the existence of a range of accessible conformations connected by low energy barriers, is an essential feature of protein binding sites.43 In the MSCS method, the organic solvent molecules serve as small molecular fragments to probe protein binding sites and the high concentrations needed to observe solvent binding implies low affinity interactions.8 At the same time, the changes in solvent environment provided by MSCS can effectively probe plasticity within the active site and elsewhere. Both NMR fragment screening data48 and computational solvent mapping10 show that small molecular fragments cluster in hot spots that have high druggability indices and that coincide with areas of the binding site consistently occupied by a range of protein inhibitors. The present study on RNAse A shows that the same is true the for organic solvent probe molecules, even though the MSCS experiments are performed in high concentrations of nonaqueous solvents. As seen with computational solvent mapping, where most probe molecules are found in a number of conformations,9,49 many of the solvent molecules (e.g. DIO 901, DMS 902) could be modeled in the RNAse A active site in more than one conformation, allowing the solvents to sample a number of interactions in a given binding site. The dioxane molecule in cluster 901 is a clear example, where rotation of the ring structure within the electron density allows the oxygen atoms to sample a multitude of H-bonding interactions [Fig. 5(D)]. This rotational freedom contributes to the free energy of binding in a way that is less likely for larger ligands with functional groups that are constrained by simultaneous optimization of many more interactions in an expanded area of the binding site. Superposition of the organic solvent binding sites onto the map provided by active site conserved water molecules and inhibitor-bound structures shows clustering of three or more solvent molecules in areas that are sampled by all of the inhibitors. This includes cluster 902 in the B1 pocket, 903 in P1 and 904 in B2, all of which are represented by multiple solvent molecules tightly clustered [Figs. 5(D­F) and 6]. Organic solvent molecules also displace three of the four water molecules displaced by inhibitors. The one exception is Wat 19, which is always displaced by one of the backbone phosphate oxygen
PROTEINS

The analysis of conserved water binding sites in the active site of RNAse A together with multiple inhibitorbound structures provide a map for determining the kinds of protein-ligand interactions that are selected by organic solvent molecules in the MSCS method. This is critical if MSCS is to be used to understand the properties of binding sites that are most important to ligand binding. Recent years have seen an emerging discussion of the fragment based approach to lead discovery framed on the idea that there are localized areas on protein binding sites that make significant contribution to binding affinity, and that by identifying the location and properties of the hot spots it is possible to maximize ligand efficiency as determined by binding affinity per heavy atom.45 This can be done by screening small frag-

atoms in the inhibitors, but in the MSCS structures interacts with the organic solvents that overlap the ribose group of the inhibitors. As elaborated in the Results, the three clusters of organic solvents define functional epitopes for inhibitor binding (often with functional group ° overlap of 1 A or less), delineating both polar and hydrophobic interactions within each site that are consistently sampled by the inhibitors. This is the case even for inhibitors that bind in different conformations to the enzyme where, other than the hot spot interactions revealed by the organic solvent clusters, the molecules make very different contacts with the protein (e.g. models with PDB codes 1RCN and 1RTA). Interestingly, the conserved water molecules that are displaced by inhibitors also make interactions with polar hot spot groups, but this would not be of use in a less well-studied binding site where the classification of conserved water molecules into structural, bridging and displaced is not so easy to make. The organic solvent molecules, however, uniquely sample main functional epitopes in the active site of RNAse A, reliably discerning the interactions that are made repeatedly by a diverse set of inhibitors. In essence, MSCS is an experimental method that can simultaneously sample hot spots, plasticity and hydration in protein binding sites, providing a comprehensive map of key elements involved in ligand binding. CONCLUSIONS A previously untested but central assumption of the MSCS method is that structural information on plasticity, hydration, and properties of binding sites obtained for proteins in organic solvents directly correlate with those properties in aqueous solution and therefore are relevant to protein function. This assumption is shown here to be correct through a series of quantitative analyses that compare the location and extent of plasticity, conserved water binding sites, and the interactions that organic solvent molecules make within the binding site of RNAse A in MSCS to those same properties taken from the vast numbers of structures solved in aqueous solution during the last four decades of work on this protein. The resulting analysis firmly establishes MSCS as a reliable method in the structural characterization of proteins and provides detailed insight into the type of information that can be extracted from clustering of organic solvent molecules in the active site.
