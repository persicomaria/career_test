Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is an ubiquitous, essential, and highly pleiotropic protein kinase whose abnormally high constitutive activity is suspected to underlie its pathogenic potential in neoplasia and other diseases. Recently, using different virtual screening approaches, we have identified several novel CK2 inhibitors. In particular, we have discovered that coumarin moiety can be considered an attractive CK2 inhibitor scaffold. In the present work, we have synthetized and tested a small library of coumarins (more than 60), rationalizing the observed structure­activity relationship. Moreover, the most promising inhibitor, 3,8-dibromo-7-hydroxy4-methylchromen-2-one (DBC), has been also crystallized in complex with CK2, and the experimental binding mode has been used to derive a linear interaction energy (LIE) model.
Introduction Casein kinase 2 (CK2)a is probably the most pleiotropic protein kinase known, with more than 300 protein substrates already recognized, a feature which might, at least partly, account for its lack of strict control over catalytic activity.1 Its catalytic subunits (R or R) are in fact constitutively active either with or without the regulatory -subunits, which appear to play a role in targeting and substrate recruiting, rather than controlling catalytic activity. Although constitutively active CK2 is ubiquitous, essential, and implicated in a wide variety of important cell functions,2 evidence has been accumulating that its catalytic subunits may behave as oncogenes,3­6 consistent with the observation that they display an antiapoptotic effect in prostate cancer cell lines.7 Actually, they are invariably more abundant in tumors compared with normal tissues, and their overexpression causes neoplastic growth in animal and cellular models presenting alterations in the expression of cellular oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes.8 These data, in conjunction with the observation that many viruses exploit CK2 as phosphorylating agent of proteins essential to their life cycle,1 are raising interest in CK2 as a potential target for antineoplastic or antiinfectious drugs.9 In the last few years, we have performed an intensive screening program, using both conventional and in silico approaches, with the aim of discovering novel potent and selective CK2 inhibitors.10,11 In particular, we have recently

implemented an in-house molecular database (defined as "MMSDatabase") in which almost 2500 kinase inhibitor-like compounds are collected for specific virtual screening applications. Several families of polyphenolic compounds, including a large class of flavones, flavonols, isoflavones, catechins, anthraquinones, coumarins, and tannic acid derivatives, are represented in our molecular database. Following some recent successful reports in discovery of new kinase inhibitors by high-throughput docking of large collections of compounds,12,13 we have performed a virtual screening experiment targeting the ATP binding site of CK2 by browsing the MMS-database. In this effort, several new derivatives have been reported as potent and selective CK2 inhibitors such as ellagic acid,14 a naturally occurring tannic acid derivative, tetrabromocinnamic acid (TBCA),15 1,8-dihydroxy-4-nitroxanthen-9-one (MNX), 8-hydroxy4-methyl-9-nitrobenzo[g]chromen-2-one (NBC),10 and 3,8dibromo-7-hydroxy-4-methylchromen-2-one(DBC),11 assummarized in Figure 1.

ingly, dietary exposure to benzopyrones is quite significant, because these compounds are found in vegetables, fruit, seeds, nuts, coffee, tea, and wine.16 It is estimated that the average western diet contains approximately 1 g/day of mixed benzopyrones.16 It is, therefore, not difficult to see why extensive research into their pharmacological and therapeutic properties has been underway over many years.16,17 In particular, coumarin is a natural substance that has shown antitumor activity in ViVo, with the effect believed to be due to its metabolites (e.g., 7-hydroxycoumarin).17 A recent study has shown that 7-hydroxycoumarin inhibits the release of cyclin D1, which is overexpressed in many types of cancer.17 This knowledge may lead to its use in cancer therapy. In the present work, we have synthetized and tested a focused library of coumarin derivatives (more than 60) with the aim of elucidating the putative binding motif and explaining structure­ activity relationships. In this study, the X-ray diffraction crystal structure of CK2 in complex with DBC has been determined, and it was exploited as a starting point for a linear interaction energy (LIE)18­25 study to rationalize the different free energies of binding and the key interactions of all coumarin derivatives. This computational approach is an efficient tool to quantitatively explore scaffold decorability and to evaluate regions of the protein active site crucial for ligand binding, as already proven for a class of CK2 inhibitors such as bromo-benzoimidazole.19 Results Focused Coumarin Library. The chemical diversity of our focused coumarin library is reported in Table 1. Several derivatives were unknown until now and they have been newly synthetized as described in the Materials and Methods section. In particular, bromocoumarin derivatives (19, 21, 26, 31, 62, 63, and 65) were prepared by direct bromination of coumarin precursors or by appropriate functionalization of bromointermediates. Different bromination schemes were used according to starting materials and substitution positions. Bromocoumarins 19 and 21 were synthesized by using N-bromosuccinimide in acetonitrile at reflux, while compounds 26, 31, 62, 63, and 65 were prepared by using bromine in acetic acid at 60 °C. Iodo or chloro analogs (2, 3, and 22, respectively) were obtained by direct halogenation at the 8 position of the already brominated coumarins by using iodine and potassium iodide in ammonia solution at room temperature or aluminum chloride at 130 °C. The acetyl derivative 11 was obtained by esterification of the phenolic function of DBC (1) with acetic anhydride and sodium acetate at reflux. Coumarins carrying a formyl, oxime, or cyano in the 8 position, such as compounds 8, 12, and 14, were prepared starting from the corresponding 3-bromocoumarin. In this way, the 8-coumarinaldehyde 14 was synthesized by formylating the starting coumarin with hexamethylenetetramine in acetic acid at reflux or microwave irradiating at 120 °C, strongly reducing the reaction time and more than doubling the yield in comparison with classical heating. Coumarin 14 was converted to oxime derivative 12 by methanolic hydroxylamine at room temperature, and the oxime group was dehydrated to the cyano group in acetic anhydride at reflux. The 8-cyanocoumarin 8 was also prepared directly by reacting compound 14 with hydroxylamine in N-methylpyrrolidone with microwave irradiation at 140 °C. The 5-bromo derivatives 39 and 40 were synthesized by condensing 2-bromo-6-hydroxybenzaldehyde with diethylmalonate and then hydrolyzing the ethyl ester in alkaline medium.

The piperazinesulfonyl-5-bromo derivatives 43 and 44 were prepared by nucleophilic substitution of the sulfonylchloride intermediates, obtained by reacting the 5-bromocoumarin with chlorosulfonic acid at reflux. The piperazinesulfonyl-8-bromo derivative 45 was obtained in an analogous manner from 8-bromocoumarin. The remaining compounds (1, 4-7, 9, 10, 13, 15-18, 20, 23-25, 27-30, 32-38, 41, 42, 46-61, 64, 66, and 67) were already known and were prepared according to literature methods (see Supporting Information for references). Finally, compounds 41 and 42 were commercially available. Crystallography. The use of CK2 R subunit from Zea mays in cocrystallization experiments has been widely adopted in recent years due to a better stability of the maize enzyme compared with the human CK2. This is also supported by its highly conserved primary structure and by almost identical catalytic properties toward all CK2 inhibitors tested up to now. The crystal structure of the complex between the R catalytic subunit and the regulatory one of the human protein has been determined,26 along with that of the isolated R catalytic subunits both from human and from maize.27­29 From these structures, it emerged that the active site of the human protein is practically identical to that of the maize one (rmCK2). Moreover, it indicates that the formation of the quaternary complex does not influence the conformation of the catalytic subunit, so the latter can be used in design of inhibitors of the holoenzyme. The close sequence and structural similarities between the Zea mays and the human R catalytic subunits (which shows 98% sequence identity with the rat one, with all the variations in the extreme C-terminal tail) strongly support the choice to work with the maize enzyme in structural inhibition studies: this enzyme has a higher tendency to produce good diffracting crystals, and this is the reason it has been preferred over the human enzyme. Like the other inhibitors, DBC binds to CK2 inside the ATPbinding site, in a position similar to those of the anthraquinone MNA10 and the xanthenone MNX,10 as shown in Figure 2. The overall structure of the protein is not affected by the binding of the inhibitor. In the final model, 327 residues out of 332 are present, from position 2 to 328; the first methionine and the four C-terminal residues Arg-Thr-Arg-Ala are not visible in the final electron density. The position of the DBC hydroxyl group is almost identical to the analogous function in MNX, lying in an area of positive electrostatic potential near Lys68. This OH group establishes two hydrogen bonds, one with the amine function of the Lys68 side chain and another with a water molecule (W1) that is conserved in all deposited CK2 structures (Figure 2). This H-bonding network seems to have a crucial role in the recognition process of all phenol-like CK2 inhibitors.30 DBC does not interact directly with the hinge region; the closest atom is the bromine ortho to the carbonyl at 3.7 Å from the Val116 carbonyl. Linear Interaction Energy Model. A linear interaction energy (LIE) approach has been used to evaluate the binding free energy of this class of CK2 inhibitors following a computational approached recently proposed by our laboratory.19 It was possible to include a total of 16 coumarins shown in Table 1 in the training set to generate the quantitative LIE model (Table 2). Most probably this is linked to the fact that some particular chemical features, present only in this subset of molecules, are the key to achieve a DBC-like binding mode, which was used as starting point for the LIE calculation. First of all, a hydroxyl group capable of interacting with the conserved water W1 (see Figure 2) must be present at the 7 position of the coumarin scaffold. This is the only crucial electrostatic interaction shown by this class of

inhibitors, and it seems to be strongly modulated in its intensity by the presence of an electron-withdrawing substituent at the 6 position of the coumarin scaffold. According to the Hammett theory, the presence of an electron-withdrawing substituent in the ortho position to phenol OH increases the acidic behavior of the phenolic group. To simulate this highly polarized hydrogen bonding, we created two possible working hypothesis: (I) in the first case, the hydroxyl group in 7 becomes anionic before forming the complex with CK2, and it is considered with a formal net charge equal to -1; (II) in the second assumption, phenol OH participates at the active site in its neutral form, and the hydrogen bonding with water W1 is so highly polarized that can be more suitably modeled as an ionic couple between a hydronium ion (water W1 is transformed into H3O+) and the anionic form of the phenol OH (Figure 2). Both these possibilities are in accordance with the fact that only ligands with a low pKa, estimated using the ACDLabs31 package, can be studied using the LIE approach considering a DBC-like binding mode. Both hypotheses resulted in high-quality and roughly comparable energy models, the best one presented here is derived by in situ ionic couple theory. Finally, almost all possess hydrophobic groups at the 8 position of the coumarin moiety, a hydrogen atom in position 5, and a nonhydrophobic group at the 6 position.

The calculated energy terms (Table 2) result in a final model with R ) 0.029, ) -0.003, and  ) 0.016. The obtained correlation factor is r2 ) 0.771 with a rmsd of 0.303 kcal/mol, and the cross-validated q2 is slightly lower (q2 ) 0.633, crossvalidated rmsd ) 0.491 kcal/mol). Free energies of binding, calculated from experimental IC5019 and predicted Gbind are shown in Table 3 and finally plotted in Chart 1. Discussion Qualitative Structure­Activity Relationship (SAR). Several important structural features of coumarin derivatives can be identified from a first qualitative analysis of their activity on CK2 (Table 1). Primarily, the hydroxyl group at the 7 position of the coumarin moiety can be considered an essential feature even if not sufficient to achieve an IC50 in a submicromolar range. Indeed, to increase the inhibitory potency, an electronwithdrawing substituent should be simultaneously present at position 8. For instance, in derivative 5 (IC50 ) 0.74 µM), a simple substitution of the bromide atom with a methoxy group (derivative 50) results in a complete loss of activity. This important effect can be rationalized according to the increase of the acidity of the 7-hydroxyl group as confirmed by our in silico predictions, where to achieve a submicromolar activity,

it is necessary that the pKa of the 7-hydroxyl group is lower than 7. This hypothesis is also supported by the experimental evidence that the substitution on DBC of the 7-hydroxyl group with the 7-amine group results again in a complete loss of activity (see derivative 62). Hydrophobic groups at positions 3 and 4, such as bromide or methyl, improve the activity, while substitutions at the 5 position result in a loss of inhibition efficiency. Halogen or nitro substituents at position 6 can be compatible with an activity around 1­4 µM according to the other decorations of coumarin moiety. SAR Considering DBC-CK2 Complex Structural Information. The crystal structure of DBC in complex with CK2 nicely explains the pharmacophore derived by SAR considerations, as summarized in Figure 3. In fact, hydrophobic groups in positions 3, 4, and 8 can interact through van der Waals interactions with the CK2 active site, while the importance of the 7-hydroxyl group is explained by its key interactions with Lys68 and water W1, a water molecule very well conserved in all CK2-inhibitor complexes available. These represent the only electrostatic interactions exploited by DBC in the binding to CK2, and most probably all other coumarin derivatives must possess this ionizable hydroxyl group to achieve a similar binding mode. However, considering the strong hydrophobic nature of the CK2 ATP-binding pocket, the crucial role of both hydrophobic interactions and desolvation effects in ligand binding is doubtless. It is most likely that when the hydrophobic contribution to the binding becomes sufficiently strong, it is possible to have active compounds that could present a binding mode different from DBC as seen for the dibromobenzo imidazole and triazole derivatives.19 In fact, crystal structure analysis and molecular modeling studies have demonstrated that these scaffolds can bind the CK2 active pocket into two different orientations. When the inhibitor can interact through a polarized hydrogen bonding with the water molecule, like tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB) derivatives, the position of the planar aromatic scaffold is similar to the one presented by the DBC-CK2 crystal structure; in contrast, the ligand can be shifted and rotated nearer the hinge region, like already observed in K44, K37, K25, or K17 crystal structures.32 In other words, even if DBC and TBB present different chemical structures, their ATP-binding pocket recognitions are comparable, and water molecules seem to adapt the protein to the ligand peculiarities. Quantitative Free Energy of Binding Model. Starting from these qualitative considerations, we analyzed the structure­activity

relationship of coumarin derivatives from a more quantitative point of view. Using the linear interaction energy method, it has been possible to build up a quantitative model using 16 coumarin derivatives and including in this training set all submicromolar inhibitors (Figure 3). The final model is statistically acceptable. This computational technique allows us to evaluate the principal contributions for inhibitor activity. The strongest effect results from van der Waals interactions (R ) 0.029), in agreement with the steric complementarily between the CK2 active pocket and almost all coumarin derivatives studied. This is followed in absolute importance by the hydrophobic effect ( ) 0.016), constituting the most variable part among the test set. Indeed this aspect is the most important to discriminate the relative activity of coumarins studied, as shown by the  normalized value of 0.854. In contrast, the very low absolute weight of the electrostatic contribution ( ) -0.003) is linked to the fact that the strong interaction with water molecule W1 is common in all inhibitors. For this reason, even if this interaction is crucial for the inhibitor orientation in the active pocket, it is not important to discriminate the activity difference inside the series studied. In particular, the nonpolar contribution to the free energy of solvation in a LIE study is represented by the difference between the solvent-accessible surface area of the ligand in complex and that of the ligand free in solution (ASAb-f). Since this contribution seems crucial for the binding of CK2 inhibitors,2,28 we tried to include it in our LIE model also using alternative types of solvent-accessible surface, such as the positive and negative accessible surface area (respectively, ASA+b-f and ASA-b-f), the charge-weighted positive and negative surface area (respectively, CASA+b-f and CASA-b-f), the van der Waals surface area (VSAb-f), the total polar surface area (PASAb-f), and the total hydrophobic surface area (HASAb-f) as collected in Table 2. Interestingly, using only the total hydrophobic surface area (HASAb-f), it is possible to obtain an acceptable LIE model, pointing out the important role of the hydrophobic contribution in the final free energy of binding. This is a clear indication of the major role played by the several nonpolar amino acid side chains that characterize the CK2 active pocket. The final energy model derived was able to predict almost all inhibitors with a hydrophobic group at the 8 position and with the pKa value of the 7-hydroxyl group lower than 7 units. A possible reason can be related to the peculiarity of CK2 ATP binding site to allow different binding modes, even among similar inhibitors, as demonstrated by several structural data available. Indeed these chemical-physical requisites of coumarins seem to discriminate between a DBC-like binding mode, used as starting point for the LIE study, and other possible ligand orientations. Conclusion A CK2 inhibitor design strategy that started more than 15 years ago with the first ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole derivatives33 has been continuously evolving with a progressive development of many submicromolar inhibitors, constantly improving the structural knowledge of their activity. Results presented here can be considered a new important tessera in the always more complete CK2 mosaic. The multidisciplinary approach used in this work connects in a virtual circle chemical synthesis, biological assays, structural information, and different molecular modeling techniques to rationally design new CK2 inhibitors. More than 60 coumarin derivatives synthesized and tested represent a strong base to analyze, propose, and corroborate hypotheses about essential inhibitor features for CK2 binding. In this particular effort, the crystallization of the DBC-CK2 complex represents a very

For the already known compounds whose 1H NMR and HRMS data were not yet available in the literature, these data are reported in Supporting Information, together with elemental analyses. Crystal Preparation of Maize CK2r in Complex with DBC and Data Collection. The recombinant CK2 R-subunit from Zea mays was expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated, and purified according to a previously described method.34 Crystals of the CK2 complex with the inhibitor DBC were obtained by cocrystallization with the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique. A 25 mM inhibitor solution (100% DMSO) was added to the 8 mg/mL protein stock solution in the proper amount to have an inhibitor-protein molar ratio of 3 to 1 and not to exceed a 5% DMSO concentration in the final protein solution. Each solution was diluted with 2 volumes of water and allowed to stand for 2 h in ice. Crystallization drops were obtained by mixing a 3 µL drop of preincubated protein-inhibitor solution with 1 µL of precipitant solution (10­20% PEG 4000, 0.2 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8). Each drop was equilibrated against 500 µL of the same precipitant solution (20% PEG 4000). Crystals grew in a few days at 293 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected at ESRF beamline BM30A in Grenoble at a temperature of 100 K. Before mounting, crystals were cryoprotected by a very rapid soaking in type B immersion oil (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). Data were indexed with MOSFLM35 and then scaled with SCALA from the CCP4 software package.36 Structure Determination and Refinement. The CK2-DBC complex crystallizes in space group C2, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. To find the best position inside the unit cell, an initial rigid body transformation on the model of the apoenzyme was adequate, using the rigid body refinement option of REFMAC 5 (CCP4 suite).36 The refinement was carried out using REFMAC5. Data collection and final model statistics are reported in Table 4. The presence of the inhibitors in the active site was clear since the beginning of the refinement in both Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc maps. The definition files for the inhibitor were created using the monomer library sketcher routine of CCP4. Refinement was carried out by alternating automated cycles and manual inspection steps using the graphic program Coot v.0.2.38 The stereochemistry and geometric properties of the final model were checked using Coot validate analysis and Sfcheck and Procheck in CCP4 suite and were adequate for the resolution. Data Deposition. The coordinates for the model of CK2 in complex with DBC has been deposited at the RCSB Protein Data Bank with ID code 2QC6.

Phosphorylation Assay. Native CK2 was purified from rat liver, as previously described.39 CK2 phosphorylation assays was carried out at 37 °C in the presence of increasing amounts of each inhibitor in a final volume of 25 µL containing 50 mM, Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 12 mM MgCl2, and 0.02 mM [33P]-ATP (500­1000 cpm/pmol), unless otherwise indicated. The phosphorylatable substrates were the synthetic peptide substrate RRRADDSDDDDD (100 µM). Reaction started with the addition of the kinase and was stopped after 10 min by addition of 5 µL of 0.5 M orthophosphoric acid before spotting aliquots onto phosphocellulose filters. Filters were washed in 75 mM phosphoric acid (5­10 mL each) four times and then once in methanol and dried before counting.40 Each determination was repeated in three independent experiments, and the means of the resulting values were calculated. Protein and Inhibitors Preparation. Using the software package Molecular Operating Environment (MOE 2006.08),41 all the ligands and the X-ray diffraction crystal structure of CK2 in complex with the ATP competitive inhibitor DBC were prepared for the linear interaction energy analysis. The water W1 was included in the protein active site for the molecular modeling study. This molecule indeed is well-conserved in almost all CK2-inhibitor complex crystal structures and seems crucial for their binding. Hydrogens were added and energy minimized using the AMBER99 force field42 until the energy gradient reached 0.05 kcal/mol. This protocol was exploited for both the neutral and anionic states of DBC to achieve two possible orientations of the water as donor or acceptor of hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, to fully understand the importance of acidity of the 7-hydroxy coumarin derivatives, the hypothesis of the ionic couple formation in the active site created by the anionic DBC form and the hydronium ion has been investigated. All inhibitors were built with MOE9 and energy minimized using the MMFF94x force field43 until a 0.01 energy gradient was attained. Their ionic states were evaluated using ACDLabs suite,32 and as starting pose of the LIE calculation, the molecules were superimposed to DBC, since all these ligands have a similar scaffold and it is likely that they share a common binding mode. Linear Interaction Energy Method Calculation. The LIE method is based on two different simulations, one describing the molecule free in solution (Uf) and the other considering the ligand-protein complex (Ub). In this approach, the inhibitor free energy of binding to a macromolecule is considered to be linearly correlated to several energy terms calculated using a molecular mechanics force field1 as shown in the following formula:
b f Gbind ) R(Uvdw  - Uvdw  ) + b f (Uelec  - Uelec  ) + b f (Ucav  - Ucav  )

(1)

Brackets indicate that the ensemble average of the energy values of van der Waals interactions (Uvdw), electrostatic contributions (Uelec), and the cavity parameter (Ucav)44 are considered during the simulation. Using a training set of molecules with known activity, we built a semiempirical energy model by fitting the three different parameter coefficients (R, , and ) to the free energy of binding.19 The LIE energy model was created using the default options of the MOE-LIE suite.41 Briefly, using the MMFF94x force field and the surface generalized Born (SGB) implicit solvent,45 we performed a Truncated Newton minimization for ligands in complex with CK2 and free in solution with a residue-based cutoff distance of 15 Å, a 0.5 root-mean-square (rms) gradient for convergence, and a maximum of 500 steps. The energy terms calculated with this protocol were used to build the binding free energy model.
