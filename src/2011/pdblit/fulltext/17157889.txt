Abstract In 1984, the first venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) with a lysine substituting for the highly conserved aspartate 49 was discovered, in the North American crotalid snake Agkistrodon p. piscivorus [J. Biol. Chem. 259 (1984) 13839]. Ten years later, the first mapping of a `toxic region' on a Lys49 PLA2 was reported, in Bothrops asper myotoxin II [J. Biol. Chem. 269 (1994) 29867]. After a further decade of research on the Lys49 PLA2s, a better understanding of their structural determinants of toxicity and mode of action is rapidly emerging, with myotoxic effector sites identified at the C-terminal region in at least four proteins: B. asper myotoxin II, A. p. piscivorus K49 PLA2, A. c. laticinctus ACL myotoxin, and B. jararacussu bothropstoxin I. Although important features still remain to be established, their toxic mode of action has now been understood in its more general concepts, and a consistent working hypothesis can be experimentally supported. It is proposed that all the toxic activities of Lys49 PLA2s are related to their ability to destabilize natural (eukaryotic and prokaryotic) and artificial membranes, using a cationic/hydrophobic effector site located at their C-terminal loop. This review summarizes the general properties of the Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins, emphasizing the development of current concepts and hypotheses concerning the molecular basis of their toxic activities. q 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Snake venom myotoxins and their classification Myotoxins can be generally defined as natural components (usually small proteins and peptides) of venom secretions, that induce irreversible damage to skeletal muscle fibers (myonecrosis) upon injection into higher animals. They are particularly abundant and widespread in venomous snakes, but can also be found in the venoms of other organisms. Some myotoxins act locally, damaging muscle fibers at the site of injection and its surroundings, whereas others act systemically, causing muscle damage at distant sites. Myonecrosis is an important medical complication of snakebites. In severe cases, local myonecrosis can lead to drastic sequelae such as permanent tissue loss, disability, or amputation (Milani et al., 1997; Otero et al., 2002). On the other hand, widespread systemic myotoxicity (rhabdomyolysis) can lead to myoglobinuria and acute renal

failure (Azevedo-Marques et al., 1985), a frequent cause of death in snakebite victims. Myotoxins described in snake venoms can be classified into three main groups (Harris and Cullen, 1990) that constitute structurally distinct protein families. These include (1) the `small' myotoxins (i.e. Crotalus durissus terrificus crotamine, Crotalus v. viridis myotoxin a), (2) the cardiotoxins, and (3) the PLA2 myotoxins (Fig. 1). The PLA2 myotoxins form the largest group, which can be further categorized into neurotoxic and non-neurotoxic types (Mebs and Ownby, 1990). Among the latter, a clear division between `Asp49' and `Lys49' myotoxins exists, as will be further detailed. A fourth group of myotoxic ´ proteins has been considered (Gutierrez and Cerdas, 1984), comprising a variety of venom components that may damage skeletal muscle by indirect mechanisms. As an example, hemorrhagic toxins that cause local blood flow impairment, ischemia, and secondary myonecrosis of slow onset, would be considered as indirect myotoxic factors.

Fig. 1. Classification and general characteristics of snake venom myotoxins.

The neurotoxic PLA2 myotoxins are commonly found in the venoms of elapid snakes, where they play a major role in its overall lethal effect. Their lethal dose 50% (LD50) values are extremely low, due to potent pre-synaptic effects at the neuromuscular junction (Rosenberg, 1990). In addition, these PLA2s cause impressive skeletal muscle necrosis at very low doses (i.e. 1 ­ 2 mg) in rodents. A wellcharacterized example of this myotoxin group is notexin, from Notechis s. scutatus (Harris et al., 1975; Dixon and Harris, 1996), an Australian elapid. Neurotoxic PLA2 myotoxins can be also present in a number of viperid/ crotalid species, as exemplified by crotoxin, a thoroughly studied venom component of C. d. terrificus from South America (Hendon and Fraenkel-Conrat, 1971; Gopalakrishnakone et al., 1984; Salvini et al., 2001). On the other hand, the non-neurotoxic PLA2 myotoxins are most commonly found in the venoms of viperids and crotalids, where they are noted as abundant components. In contrast to their neurotoxic counterparts, these PLA2s ´ generally display high LD50 values (Gutierrez et al., 1986b; Homsi-Brandeburgo et al., 1988; Rosenberg, 1990; ~ Angulo et al., 1997; Andriao-Escarso et al., 2000; Soares et al., 2000a,b), being of little relevance for the overall lethal effect of their corresponding venoms (Lomonte et al., 1985). Their myotoxic potencies are also weaker when compared to the neurotoxic-type PLA2s (i.e. doses of 25 ­ 100 mg are commonly utilized in mouse models of myonecrosis). However, due to their abundance in the venom of viperids/crotalids, and to the large amounts of venom

frequently injected in such accidents, these myotoxins are undoubtedly central to the development of myonecrosis. Their predominant role in the myotoxicity of the corresponding crude venoms has been demonstrated by using specific neutralizers, such as antibodies or other inhibitory molecules. When the PLA2 myotoxins are selectively neutralized, most of the muscle-damaging effect of whole venoms is prevented (Lomonte et al., 1987, 1990a, 1992; Moura-da-Silva et al., 1991b; Melo and Ownby, 1999; Trento et al., 2001). Moreover, venoms that contain these PLA2 myotoxins induce a significantly higher muscle damage than venoms that lack them (Moura-da-Silva et al., 1990). Among the non-neurotoxic PLA2 myotoxins, two different types can be recognized: `classical' Asp49 PLA2s, which catalyze the hydrolysis of the ester bond in the sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids; and `variant' Lys49 PLA2s, or `PLA2-like' proteins, which are devoid of enzymatic activity (Fig. 1). In addition, at least two variants with serine occupying position 49 (Ser49 PLA2s) have been ´ described (Krizaj et al., 1991; Polgar et al., 1996). In the general structural classification of PLA2 (EC 3.1.1.4) enzymes (Six and Dennis, 2000; Kudo and Murakami, 2002), the non-neurotoxic PLA2 myotoxins of viperids/crotalids belong to group IIA. Irrespectively of their ability to catalyze phospholipid hydrolysis (Asp49type), or not (Lys49-type), all of the non-neurotoxic PLA2s myotoxins, as implied by their name, induce skeletal muscle damage. Thus, the Lys49 myotoxins have attracted attention

as models for the induction of myonecrosis by a catalytically independent mechanism of action.

3. Are the Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins active as phospholipolytic enzymes? An essential step for understanding the toxic effects of the Lys49 PLA2s is to define if they possess enzymatic activity or not, due its potential implications for their mechanism of action. Following the site-directed mutagenesis studies with Asp49 ! Lys recombinants of porcine (van den Bergh et al., 1988) and bovine (Li et al., 1994) pancreatic PLA2s, and the extensive purification strategies of natural Lys49 proteins utilized by van den Bergh et al. (1988) and Scott et al. (1992), a strong argument against the originally described catalytic activity of Lys49 PLA2s was made. Due to the difficulty of achieving an absolute chromatographic separation of Lys49 and Asp49 isoforms, which often coexist in a given venom (Lomonte and Carmona, 1992), contaminant traces of the latter have been assumed to be responsible for the low levels of enzymatic activity frequently observed in Lys49 PLA2 preparations, depending on the sensitivity of the assays. However, some studies have opposed this interpretation, claiming that this low enzymatic activity is inherent to the Lys49 proteins, and that it becomes even more significant on certain types or forms of substrates (Yoshizumi et al., 1990; Liu et al., 1990; Shimohigashi et al., 1995; Rodrigues-Simioni et al., 1995; Yamaguchi et al., 1997; Mancin et al., 1997; Soares et al., 2002). Until recently, these analyses had always been conducted with proteins isolated from their natural sources, and therefore, with the possibility of trace contamination remaining as a confounding factor. However, the recent availability of recombinant Lys49 PLA2s (Ward et al., 2001; Giuliani et al., 2001) has provided new tools to approach this problem. In particular, a study using recombinant bothropstoxin I significantly contributed to clarify this essential issue (Ward et al., 2002), by demonstrating that the protein was enzymatically inactive in vitro, in contrast to an extensively purified natural sample, which displayed a very low, but detectable activity. Moreover, the Lys49 ! Asp mutant of bothropstoxin I was still catalytically inactive, demonstrating that not only the single Asp49 replacement with lysine, but other structural changes as well, are important for the lack of enzymatic activity of this protein (Ward et al., 2002). These findings clearly favor the concept that Lys49 PLA2s are enzymatically inert in vitro, and it will be of interest to learn of future studies re-examining the enzymatic activity of more Lys49 proteins, when obtained in recombinant form. A possible explanation for the lack of enzymatic activity of Lys49 proteins was suggested in a crystallographic study of piratoxin II (Lee et al., 2001). These authors proposed that the Lys49 PLA2s may possess structural features that preclude the release of the free fatty acid produced after an initial phospholipid hydrolysis, thereby interrupting the catalytic cycle, and turning these proteins, in practice, into inactive enzymes. On the other hand, an argument has been presented that Lys49 PLA2s, despite being catalytically inactive on

2. The Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins Maraganore et al. (1984) described a new type of PLA2, present in the venoms of Agkistrodon p. piscivorus and Bothrops atrox, which showed significant substitutions in amino acid residues previously considered to be invariant among PLA2s. The most notable variation was the replacement of Asp49, a key residue for binding the essential Ca2þ-cofactor, by lysine. Therefore, they named these proteins as `Lys49 PLA2s', and proposed a catalytic mechanism operating with a reversed order of addition of calcium and substrate in the formation of the ternary catalytic complex (Maraganore et al., 1984; Maraganore and Heinrikson, 1986). However, this proposal was subsequently challenged by the studies of van den Bergh et al. (1988) and Scott et al. (1992), who suggested that the low level of enzymatic activity originally detected in the A. p. piscivorus Lys49 PLA2 was probably due to contamination with basic Asp49 PLA2 isoforms present in the same venom, and that the Lys49 proteins were catalytically inert. Thereafter, the controversy on the inactivity/activity of Lys49 PLA2s as enzymes has been continuously present in the literature, and authors have frequently referred to them as `PLA2s with no (or very low) catalytic activity'. This issue will be further discussed in detail. Reports on the toxic activities exerted by the Lys49 PLA2s appeared few years after their discovery, since initial studies only focused on their structure, and its implications for the catalytic mechanism of PLA2s. Dhillon et al. (1987) first showed that the A. p. piscivorus Lys49 protein was cardiotoxic, and affected the directly evoked contractions of nerve-diaphragm preparations. They observed that the potency of these effects did not correlate with the low level ´ of PLA2 activity of the protein. On the other hand, Gutierrez et al. (1986a), Homsi-Brandeburgo et al. (1988), and ´ Lomonte and Gutierrez (1989), reported the isolation of three basic proteins with myotoxic activity from different Bothrops spp. venoms, which had structural features of PLA2s, but without a detectable catalytic activity. In retrospective, it is interesting to note that no relationship was initially established between these three myotoxins, and the novel type of Lys49 PLA2 reported earlier by Maraganore et al. (1984). However, this relationship soon became evident, probably starting with the isolation and sequencing of `basic proteins I and II' from Trimeresurus flavoviridis (Yoshizumi et al., 1990; Liu et al., 1990). Since then, the Lys49 PLA2 myotoxin family has been gradually expanded, with proteins newly isolated or cloned from a variety of crotalid/viperid species. A recent review on this subject listed nine Lys49 myotoxins (Ownby et al., 1999), while this number has quadrupled in the last 4 years (Table 1).

artificial substrates in vitro, are able to hydrolyze specific forms or types of natural substrates present only in biological systems (Fletcher et al., 1997; Fletcher and Jiang, 1998). This hypothesis was proposed on the basis of assays that utilize radiolabeled cell cultures as a natural substrate, in which an extensive release of fatty acids is observed after exposure to Lys49 PLA2s (Fletcher et al., 1996, 1997; Soares et al., 2002). However, as admitted in such studies, these assays cannot discern if fatty acid release originates from a direct catalytic action of the Lys49 PLA2 on some substrate, or is due to an indirect activation of

endogenous cellular lipases. The latter would seem highly probable, given the fact that all Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins evaluated to date cause cell membrane disturbances in a broad variety of cell types in vitro, ultimately leading to their cytolysis (Lomonte et al., 1994b, 1999a). It is ´ conceivable, for example, that an influx of Ca2þ(Gutierrez et al., 1989; Incerpi et al., 1995; Rufini et al., 1996) or Naþ (Johnson and Ownby, 1994) ions, caused even by subcytolytic concentrations of a Lys49 PLA2 (or other membrane-active factors, for that matter) could initiate a variety of intracellular processes, including the activation of

889

endogenous lipases. Indeed, membrane-active peptides such as cardiotoxins or bee venom mellitin (of synthetic origin, free of PLA2 contamination), which are not catalytic, induce breakdown of phospholipids and production of free fatty acids in skeletal muscle cell cultures, compatible with an activation of endogenous phospholipase C enzymes (Fletcher et al., 1991). On these grounds, the hypothesis of a highly selective catalytic action of Lys49 PLA2s, being exerted exclusively on biological substrates, is difficult to sustain, at least until novel unambiguous evidence is provided. In summary, there is currently no unambiguous proof that the Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins are enzymatically active phospholipolytic proteins per se, and thus, their mechanism of action should be explained via a catalytic-independent initial event on their target cells.

4. Activities of the Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins and their in vivo and in vitro study models In vivo, the main action of the Lys49 PLA2s, when injected intramuscularly (in resemblance of a snakebite), is local myotoxicity. This effect has been generally studied in mice, using histological and ultrastructural techniques ´ (Gutierrez et al., 1986a, 1989; Homsi-Brandeburgo et al., ´ 1988; Lomonte and Gutierrez, 1989; Lomonte et al., 1990b; Soares et al., 1998; Toyama et al., 1998; Melo and Ownby, 1999), intravital microscopy (Lomonte et al., 1994d), and ´ the plasma creatine kinase release assay (Gutierrez et al., ´ 1986a; Lomonte and Gutierrez, 1989; Lomonte et al., 1990a,b; Kihara et al., 1992; Angulo et al., 1997, 2000; Soares et al., 2002). Ex vivo assays for myotoxicity have also been described, based on creatine kinase release rates ´ from isolated muscle preparations (Gutierrez et al., 1986b; Melo et al., 1993; Melo and Ownby, 1999). In vivo, local myotoxicity is accompanied by other toxic effects, including a moderate edema, studied by footpad swelling techniques ´ (Lomonte and Gutierrez, 1989; Liu et al., 1991; Soares et al., ~ 1998, 2002; Chaves et al., 1998; Andriao-Escarso et al., 2000; Angulo et al., 2000; Landucci et al., 2000), hyperalgesia (Chacur et al., 2003), and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (Lomonte et al., 1993). Another in vivo toxic effect, although studied in assays utilizing `artificial' routes of administration, is the general lethal activity via intravenous or intraperitoneal ´ injections in mice (Gutierrez et al., 1986b; Homsi-Brande~ burgo et al., 1988; Angulo et al., 1997; Andriao-Escarso et al., 2000; Soares et al., 2000a,b). As mentioned, the lethal potency of the non-neurotoxic PLA2 myotoxins in LD50 assays is generally very low, and intramuscular injections of high toxin doses do not result in lethality. The ability of some Lys49 myotoxins to recruit leukocytes in a pleural cavity in vivo model has also been described (de Castro et al., 2000).

In vitro, toxic effects on isolated neuromuscular preparations, such as the mouse phrenic-diaphragm and chick biventer cervicis, have been characterized for several Lys49 myotoxins (Dhillon et al., 1987; Heluany et al., 1992; Oshima-Franco et al., 2001; Soares et al., 2000b). In addition, in vitro assays using different cell targets have demonstrated a broad specificity in their cytolytic action ´ (Bruses et al., 1993; Lomonte et al., 1994b,c, 1999a; Incerpi ~ et al., 1995; Rufini et al., 1996; Andriao-Escarso et al., 2000; Angulo et al., 2000; Soares et al., 2002), and the use of cell cultures, such as rodent lines of skeletal muscle myoblasts/ myotubes, appears to correlate well with their in vivo myotoxicity (Incerpi et al., 1995; Lomonte et al., 1999a). Liposome disruption, particularly if containing negatively charged phospholipids, is another in vitro effect common to ´ Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins explored to date (Diaz et al., 1991; Rufini et al., 1992; Pedersen et al., 1994, 1995; Shen and Cho, 1995; Soares et al., 2000a,b). In vitro mast cell degranulation by some Lys49 myotoxins has been demonstrated, and related to their edematigenous activity (Landucci et al., 1998). Also, their ability to induce neutrophil migration in chemotaxis chambers (Gambero et al., 2002), and to exert renal damage in isolated perfused kidneys (Barbosa et al., 2002) have been reported. Lastly, a wide-spectrum bactericidal activity of Lys49 myotoxins was described as a novel, catalytic-independent effect for PLA2 molecules, using B. asper myotoxin II and its synthetic ´ C-terminal peptide 115­ 129 (Paramo et al., 1998). This activity has been recently observed for other Lys49 myotoxins (Soares et al., 2000b, 2001), suggesting that it may be a general property of this protein family. Given this range of in vivo and in vitro effects of the Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins, another essential question opens: are the different activities due to different molecular regions, or is there a single `toxic' site that exerts a common mechanism with different manifestations, depending on the target? In our view, current evidence suggests the latter to be the case, as discussed below, and we propose that all the toxic activities of Lys49 PLA2s are related to their ability to interact with, and destabilize biological membranes, using the same general effector site.

5. The search for a toxic site in Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins: approaches and strategies The lack of enzymatic activity observed in myotoxic Lys49 PLA2s prompted the search for a protein region that would be responsible for their toxic effects, in order to explain their mechanism of action. Different strategies have been utilized to this end, including: (a) chemical modification of the toxins, (b) sequence comparison analyses, (c) interaction with neutralizing molecules, (d) synthetic peptide studies, and (e) site-directed mutagenesis analyses. All these approaches have been greatly enhanced by

the elucidation of the three-dimensional crystal structure of a number of Lys49 PLA2s (Scott et al., 1986, 1992; Holland ´ et al., 1990; Arni and Gutierrez, 1993; Arni and Ward, 1996; Arni et al., 1995, 1999; Treharne et al., 1997; Canduri et al., 1998; Soares et al., 1998; de Azevedo et al., 1998, 1999; Fontes et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2003), which has allowed fundamental insights for the current understanding of their structure ­function relationship (reviewed by Murakami and Arni, this issue). Chemical modification and site-directed mutagenesis analyses are reviewed by Soares and Giglio, and Chioato and Ward, respectively (present issue). They will be briefly mentioned here, only in relation to other experimental strategies discussed in detail: the neutralizing interaction between heparin and Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins, and the identification of their toxic region by the use of short synthetic peptides. In the 1990s, a number of complete sequences for Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins gradually accumulated, allowing to search for amino acid residues that could be theoretically associated to their toxic actions, on the basis of comparisons (Selistre de Araujo et al., 1996a,b; Ward et al., 1998). However, before these sequence analyses were performed, a different approach had provided an essential clue towards identifying the toxic region of these proteins, initially using B. asper myotoxin II (Lomonte et al., 1994a). In this approach, it was reasoned that by mapping the interaction site of the toxin with neutralizing molecules, information on the molecular region relevant for toxicity could be obtained. Initially, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to B. asper myotoxins were investigated (Lomonte and Kahan, 1988; Lomonte et al., 1992), but none was able to recognize denatured myotoxin, implying their binding to conformation-dependent or discontinuous epitopes, which precluded an easy mapping. However, after reports describing that heparin could inhibit the myotoxic activity of B. jararacussu venom (Melo and Suarez-Kurtz, 1988), and its bohtropstoxin (Melo et al., 1993), a study was undertaken to identify the heparin-binding site on B. asper myotoxin II. Candidate segments of its sequence were selected, and by utilizing their corresponding synthetic peptides, it was demonstrated that a heparin-binding site mapped within the sequence 115­ 129 (numbering of Renetseder et al., 1985), in the C-terminal loop (Lomonte et al., 1994a). Subsequently, this region was also identified as a heparinbinding site in the rat class IIA secreted PLA2 (Murakami et al., 1996). Since heparin preparations normally consist of polysaccharide chains that are heterogeneous in length, it was informative to determine the minimal structure able to interact with, and to inhibit, the activity of myotoxin II. Experiments with heparin fragments identified hexasaccharides as this minimal structure (Fig. 2a; Lomonte et al., 1994a). As represented in Fig. 2b, the molecular dimensions of segment 115­129 are roughly comparable to those of heparin hexasaccharides. This implied that hexasaccharides

were interacting with a narrow protein segment, which might comprise, or at least be very close to, the putative toxic site (as opposed to a mechanism in which long heparin chains could sterically hinder a toxic site distant from their binding site). Remarkably, when the free synthetic peptide 115­129 was tested by an in vitro cytotoxicity assay, a weaker, but nonetheless specific cytolytic activity was observed (Lomonte et al., 1994a), resembling that of the whole protein. The toxic action of this peptide, like that of myotoxin II, was also inhibited by heparin. Thus, it was evident that heparin was neutralizing B. asper myotoxin II by binding to its C-terminal region 115­ 129, which was directly involved in the cytotoxic mechanism of this protein (Lomonte et al., 1994a). At the same time, it was observed that cyanogen bromide (CNBr) treatment of B. asper myotoxin II, by cleaving its N-terminal octapeptide, significantly decreased its membrane-damaging activities, including ´ both liposome disruption and myotoxicity (Diaz et al., 1994). This suggested the participation of the N-terminal region in its mechanism of action, although the possibility of distant structural alterations caused by the ´ cleavage of segment 1 ­ 8 could not be excluded (Diaz et al., 1994). CNBr treatment of other Lys49 myotoxins such as BnSP-7 (Soares et al., 2000b) and piratoxin I (Soares et al., 2001) resulted in similar findings, in agreement with the possible functional relevance of the N-terminal helix of these proteins in toxicity. Subsequent studies on B. asper myotoxin II utilized an immunochemical approach to confirm that the region 115­ 129, rich in cationic and hydrophobic residues, was involved not only in its cytotoxic activity, but also in its myotoxic effect in vivo. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against peptide 115­ 129, were capable of binding to the native toxin, inhibiting both its cytotoxic and myotoxic actions ´ (Calderon and Lomonte, 1998, 1999). Unexpectedly, when the role of the N-terminal a-helix of B. asper myotoxin II was evaluated by the same approach (using antibodies directed towards the sequence 1 ­ 15), no evidence of inhibition of toxic activities was obtained (Angulo et al., 2001). This puzzling result opened doubts as to the exact participation of the N-terminal region in the toxic mechanism of Lys49 myotoxins, originally supported by CNBr-treatment experiments. Thus, more work needs to be focused on this protein region to settle these contrasting findings. The information gathered on B. asper myotoxin II allowed to propose an initial model for its mechanism of ´ action (Gutierrez and Lomonte, 1995, 1997), further ´ extended by the findings of Calderon and Lomonte (1998, 1999). In this model, the toxin would approach the cell membrane with both the C- and N-terminal regions exposed on the face of interaction (Fig. 2a). Considering that the N-terminal region participates in interface recognition by PLA2s (Scott et al., 1990; Kato et al., 1994), and that residues 115­ 129 had been shown to form an amphiphilic,

cationic ­ hydrophobic structure capable of destabilizing different types of membranes (Lomonte et al., 1994a; ´ Paramo et al., 1998), the model proposed that the role of the former site would be related to toxin binding to an unidentified acceptor on the cell membrane, while the role of the latter site would involve both a contribution to binding, and a subsequent perturbation of membrane integrity, leading to the myotoxic effect of this protein ´ (Calderon and Lomonte, 1998).

Parallel studies on the structure of bothropstoxin I from B. jararacussu, using X-ray crystallography and fluorescence spectroscopy, added a novel feature to the model of action of Lys49 myotoxins originally developed with B. asper myotoxin II. The bothropstoxin homodimer appeared in two conformations, `open' and `closed' forms, which varied in the angle formed by the monomers (da Silva Giotto et al., 1998). Thus, the dimer interface might act as a hinge, allowing the relative displacement of the C-terminal region

892

° by as much as 13 A, which, if occurring upon membrane binding, could contribute to its insertion and to disorganization of phospholipid bilayers (da Silva Giotto et al., 1998). Therefore, this concept of a molecular hinge in bothropstoxin I, fitted well into the framework of the proposed model of action of B. asper myotoxin II, which implicated the C-terminal segment 115­ 129 as the main effector of membrane destabilization (Lomonte et al., ´ ´ 1994a; Paramo et al., 1998; Calderon and Lomonte, 1998). It will be of interest to determine if such quaternary conformation changes also occur in other dimeric Lys49 PLA2s. After recognizing the relevance of the C-terminal region in the toxic effects exerted by B. asper myotoxin II, further work has explored the structural basis of the membranedamaging effects induced by this cationic­ hydrophobic combination of amino acids, in the Lys49 myotoxins. Two main questions that followed were: (a) is the region 115­ 129 involved in the toxic effects of other Lys49 PLA2s? and, (b) which amino acids within this region play a major role in the toxic mechanism? These questions have been approached mostly by two strategies. Our group has utilized synthetic peptides as tools to investigate mainly the first point, as summarized below. On the other hand, studies by Ward and co-workers have tackled the second question, using an in-depth mutagenesis approach with one Lys49 myotoxin, bothropstoxin I (reviewed by Chioato and Ward, this issue). The data gradually emerging from these two strategies are in general good agreement, and together with other relevant lines of information, have contributed to construct a better picture of how the Lys49 myotoxins may function.

6. Experiments with synthetic peptides of Lys49 myotoxins: what has been learned? The originally described toxic action of synthetic peptide 115­ 129 of B. asper myotoxin II (KKYRYYLKPLCKK), was a cytotoxic effect towards cultured endothelial cells-- utilized as a target model at the time--that mimicked the effect of the whole toxin, although with a lower efficiency (Lomonte et al., 1994a). This 13-mer peptide alone, however, was unable to reproduce the myotoxic action of the protein in vivo, and therefore, the segment 115­ 129 was cautiously referred to as a `cytolytic region' of this toxin (Lomonte et al., 1994a), until further evidence of its role in ´ myotoxicity could be obtained (Calderon and Lomonte, 1998, 1999). Since the action of peptide 115­ 129 on membranes was proposed to depend on its amphiphilic nature (with a prominent cluster of three tyrosines surrounded by several cationic residues), it was hypothesized that a modification of its hydrophobic character, without changing its charge pattern, might influence its toxic effects. Thus, the activities of a triple Tyr ! Trp substituted

synthetic peptide 115 ­ 129, named `p115-W3', were evaluated. Remarkably, p115-W3 displayed not only an enhanced membrane-damaging action, but reproduced all the toxic activities of myotoxin II, including its cytotoxic, bactericidal, edema-forming, and, most importantly, its myotoxic action in vivo (Lomonte et al., 1999b). This provided the first example of a short, PLA2-based peptide, with the ability to reproduce the myotoxic mechanism of its parent protein, in support of the proposed relevance of region 115­ 129 for the myotoxic mechanism of B. asper myotoxin II. Subsequent work led to the identification of the myotoxic site of A. p. piscivorus Lys49 PLA2 also within its sequence 115­129, by demonstrating that the corresponding peptide (KKYKAYFKLKCKK) induced myonecrosis in vivo ´~ (Nunez et al., 2001; Lomonte et al., 2003). In particular, ´~ the study of Nunez et al. (2001) constituted the first report of an unmodified, PLA2-derived synthetic peptide reproducing the myotoxic effect of its parent molecule, which coincidentally was the first Lys49 PLA2 described (Maraganore et al., 1984). Interestingly, two C-terminal peptides corresponding to the Asp49 PLA2 myotoxin counterparts from B. asper and A. p. piscivorus venoms, respectively, tested negative for toxic activities. This suggested that the enzymatically active Asp49 myotoxins may not utilize their C-terminal region as an effector of membrane damage, in ´~ contrast to the Lys49 isoforms (Nunez et al., 2001). However, more recent evidence opens alternative interpretations for these findings (Lomonte et al., 2003), which require further analysis. The observation of direct toxic actions being exerted by two peptides 115­ 129 of Lys49 myotoxins (Lomonte ´~ et al., 1994b; Nu n ez et al., 2001), prompted a comparative study, to determine if this would represent a common feature of this protein family. When a series of peptides 115 ­ 129 were investigated, they varied widely in their activities, ranging from fully toxic to innocuous (Lomonte et al., 2003). Notably, the Cterminal peptide from A. contortrix laticinctus Lys49 PLA2 induced myonecrosis in vivo, thus identifying the myotoxic site in another protein of this family (Lomonte et al., 2003). However, this study also showed that the toxic actions of Lys49 PLA2s cannot always be reproduced by their free segments 115­ 129, as several of them tested negative in the bioassays. The interpretation of the wide variability in the effects of the free, synthetic C-terminal peptides 115­ 129 of different Lys49 myotoxins, is complex and mostly speculative at this moment. On one hand, considering the significant sequence variability of this region in Lys49 proteins (Fig. 3), the possibility of subtle differences in the mechanism of action between individual toxins cannot be excluded. However, from an evolutionary perspective, it would seem unlikely that the Lys49 myotoxins, forming a closely related phylogenetic group (Ogawa et al., 1995; Tsai et al., 2001; Angulo et al., 2002), would have

Fig. 3. Sequence variability in Lys49 phospholipase A2 myotoxins. The complete amino acid sequences of 24 Lys49 PLA2s (Table 1) were aligned using CLUSTAL W (Higgins et al., 1996). In (A), percentage substitution was calculated according to the method of Kini and Chan (1999), and represents the replacement frequency for a given amino acid position, in comparison to a consensus sequence of the 24 proteins (SLFELGKMIL QETGKNPAKS YGLYGCNCGV GGRGKPKDAT DRCCYVHKCC YKKLTDCDPK KDRYSYSWKN KTIVCGENNP _CLKELCECD KAVAICLREN LDTYNKKYKI _YLKPFCKKA _DAC). Dashes indicate gaps introduced to optimize alignment, resulting in a total of 124 positions. A zero value represents invariant residues. In (B), variability refers to the number of different amino acids found at a given position. A value of one represents invariant residues. Both calculations were performed with a program written for the Matlab software (MathWorks, Inc.). The horizontal black bar indicates the location of region 115 ­129 (numbering of Renetseder et al., 1985), corresponding to positions 106­ 119 in this scheme. In both analyses, the C-terminal region 115 ­129 shows higher variability than other regions, with 7 out of the 13 positions presenting $45% substitution frequency (A), or 8 out of the 13 positions having variability scores $4 (B). Black triangles point to Lys115 and Lys122, the only invariant residues within region 115­129. Black-filled vertical bars in (B) identify the conserved Cys residues of class II PLA2s.

developed markedly different membrane-damaging regions (and mechanisms) in different snake species. In this regard, the direct evidence of toxicity exerted by Cterminal peptides of at least three Lys49 PLA2s, namely from B. asper (Lomonte et al., 1994a, 2003; Chacur et al., ´~ 2003), A. p. piscivorus (Nunez et al., 2001), and A. c. laticinctus (Lomonte et al., 2003), together with the sitedirected mutagenesis evidence obtained for bothropstoxin I (Chioato et al., 2002), suggests that this region might also play a central role in the toxic mechanism of other members of this family. It is noteworthy that region 115­ 129 has also been shown to be relevant for the activity of ammodytoxin A, a pre-synaptically neurotoxic, class II Asp49 PLA2 from Vipera ammodytes (Ivanovski et al., 2000). Also of interest is the observation that a C-terminal sequence related to snake class IIA PLA2s, when introduced into the non-toxic porcine pancreatic PLA2, drastically changed its interfacial kinetics and binding properties (Janssen et al., 1999).

Sequence variability in the C-terminal extension among the different Lys49 PLA2s (Fig. 3) would initially seem contradictory with the proposal of its key role in toxicity, since function would be expected to associate with structural conservation. But it is also possible to conceive the C-terminal loop of this protein family as a region that allowed mutational `experiments' during evolution, ultimately leading to the acquisition of a membrane-perturbing function that is not strictly dependent on a fixed, invariant sequence. Lys115 and Lys122 are so far the only two invariant residues in region 115­ 129 of Lys49 myotoxins (Fig. 3). Kini and Chan (1999) demonstrated that the exposed residues of PLA2s have evolved at a faster rate than buried amino acids, probably in relation to the acquisition of variable specificities and toxic effects of these proteins. The mechanism of membrane damage exerted by synthetic peptides of Lys49 myotoxins relies on their amphiphilic nature, provided by combinations of cationic and hydrophobic

894

amino acids that are somewhat variable. It is noteworthy that such myotoxin peptides have a functional resemblance to the widely distributed cationic antimicrobial ´ peptides (Kini and Evans, 1989; Paramo et al., 1998; ´ Santamaria et al., in preparation), which show high sequence variability. A great deal of work on antimicrobial peptides has demonstrated that membrane-damaging effects may be achieved through a variety of amino acid combinations involving cationic and hydrophobic residues (Hancock and Lehrer, 1998; Hancock and Chapple, 1999; Ganz and Lehrer, 1999). This might explain the apparent paradox between the observed sequence variability in the C-terminal region of the Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins, and its proposed central role for their toxic functions. In conclusion, the use of synthetic peptides has provided solid evidence to identify the C-terminal region as the effector of toxic activities in Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins, in at least three examples. The fact that single peptides, as short as 13-mers, can reproduce all the main toxic activities of their parent molecules, does not support the existence of different molecular sites responsible for the myotoxic, cytotoxic, edema-forming, liposome-disrupting, hyperalgesic, or microbicidal mechanisms. Rather, this evidence strongly favors the notion that the Lys49 PLA2s utilize a single site to exert membrane damage, which manifests differently in various targets and assay models. Our proposal of a single membrane-damaging site does not imply that other molecular motifs do not participate in enhancing or complementing the action of this effector toxic site, as evidenced by the lower potency of synthetic C-terminal peptides, compared to their corresponding proteins. In particular, regions involved in myotoxin binding to membrane acceptor(s), would be candidates for such enhancing role, for example by increasing their overall affinity, thus facilitating the membrane-damaging mechanism. 7. Membrane acceptor(s) for Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins: novel clues from an `all-D' peptide Knowing that heparin interacted with the C-terminal region of B. asper myotoxin II and its peptide 115­ 129 (Lomonte et al., 1994a), prompted an investigation to explore if heparan sulfate, a common component of cell surfaces, would act as an acceptor for this Lys49 PLA2. However, this possibility was ruled out, on the basis of the unaffected ability of myotoxin II to lyse cells in which heparan sulfate was eliminated by either enzymatic treatment, synthesis inhibition, or via a specific cellular mutation (Lomonte et al., 1994c). Sialic acid and N-linked oligosaccharides neither appear to be involved in recognition by this Lys49 myotoxin, as shown by neuraminidase and tunicamycin cell treatments, respectively (Lomonte et al., 1994b). On the other hand, the discovery of membrane protein receptors for endogenous PLA2s on many mammalian cell types, utilized in some cases as high affinity acceptors by exogenous venom PLA2s (Lambeau and Lazdunski, 1999),

suggests the possibility that Lys49 myotoxins may utilize such proteins in their mechanism. However, no evidence has yet been reported in this regard. On the contrary, despite the nature of the membrane acceptor for these toxins being unknown, indirect lines of evidence suggest that it may not be a protein: (a) Lys49 myotoxins disrupt liposomes prepared exclusively of phospholipids, with a preference ´ for negatively charged types (Diaz et al., 1991; Rufini et al., 1992; Pedersen et al., 1994, 1995); (b) Lys49 myotoxins lyse a variety of cell types in culture, showing little ´ selectivity in their cytotoxic action (Bruses et al., 1993; Lomonte et al., 1994b,c, 1999a; Incerpi et al., 1995; Rufini et al., 1996); (c) Lys49 myotoxins also lyse prokaryotic cells ´ (Paramo et al., 1998; Soares et al., 2000b, 2001) via a membrane-permeabilization action; (d) the enrichment of erythrocyte membranes with negatively charged phospholipids increases their susceptibility to lysis by Lys49 ´ myotoxins (Diaz et al., 2001); and (e) most suggestively, a synthetic enantiomer of peptide 115­ 129 of A. p. piscivorus, containing only D -amino acids, expressed the same cytotoxic and myotoxic activity as its L -counterpart (Lomonte et al., 2003). This observation, if extrapolable to the whole parent molecule, provides an important clue to indicate that the action of myotoxic Lys49 PLA2s may not involve a configuration-dependent interaction (such as recognition of a PLA2 receptor protein), but rather would be compatible with binding to phospholipids. Taken together, these findings suggest that negatively charged membrane phospholipids might be utilized as acceptors for the Lys49 myotoxins. But more work is clearly needed to properly address this hypothesis.

8. The toxic mechanism of Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins: current evidence integrated Two decades after their discovery, the Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins now constitute a well characterized group of proteins (Table 1), with not less than 24 complete amino acid sequences, and 11 three-dimensional crystal structures determined. Their main effect in vivo is myonecrosis, rapidly induced at the site of injection. Myotoxicity, as well as other activities, may all be attributed to their ability to alter membrane integrity in a variety of natural (including both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells) and artificial (i.e. liposome) targets. But mature skeletal muscle fibers would probably be most susceptible to their action (Lomonte et al., 1994a, 1999a). Current evidence indicates that their membrane-damaging mechanism is not dependent on an intrinsic phospholipolytic activity, if this debated activity exists at all, but is rather a function of their physical interaction with some anionic acceptor(s), which might consist of negatively charged phospholipids. This interaction utilizes amino acid residues located on the PLA2 interfacial recognition face of Lys49 myotoxins (Fig. 4),

Fig. 4. An integrated model to explain the mechanism of action of Lys49 phospholipase A2 myotoxins. (A) A dimeric myotoxin, represented by B. asper myotoxin II, is shown with gray a-carbon backbone, and black C-terminal segments 115­129 (C) and Nterminal segments 1­8 (N), approaching a membrane (simplified, not drawn to scale). Gray and black circles represent head groups of zwitterionic and anionic phospholipids, respectively. (B) The toxin establishes initial, weak electrostatic interactions with anionic phospholipids (or other yet unidentified negatively charged acceptors), using its basic amino acids within the C-terminal 115­129 region, with the possible (see text) contribution of residues of the Nterminal a-helix. (C) The binding interaction is strenghtened by subsequent involvement of hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids whithin the effector segment 115­129, which partially penetrate and disorganize the bilayer, altering its permeability to ions (dashed arrows). Relative motion of the angle formed between the two monomers (thick empty arrows) may play a role in the membrane perturbation mechanism of the dimeric Lys49 myotoxins. In addition, the possible acylation of Lys49 myotoxins (not represented) may have an enhancing role in their membrane-perturbing mechanism.

displaying a dense positive charge distribution (Falconi et al., 2000), which exposes both their C-terminal loop and N-terminal a-helix towards the membrane. Cationic amino acids within the C-terminal region (Lomonte et al., 1994a, ´ ´~ 1999b, 2003; Calderon and Lomonte, 1998, 1999; Nunez et al., 2001; Chioato et al., 2002), and possibly also within ´ the N-terminal region (Diaz et al., 1994), would establish initial, weak electrostatic interactions with the anionic acceptor sites, as suggested by wash-out experiments (Lomonte et al., 1994b), and in analogy with the principles of interfacial binding of other PLA2s (Zhou and Schulten, 1996; Stahelin and Cho, 2001). Within the C-terminal region, the conserved Lys122 might play a central role in the toxic mechanism, as demonstrated by the Lys122 ! Ala mutant of bohtropstoxin I, together with significant contributions by Tyr117 and Arg118 (Chioato et al., 2002). A dimeric state might be essential in some Lys49 myotoxins, as demonstrated with bothropstoxin I (de Oliveira et al., 2001). The initially weak toxin-membrane interaction would be further strengthened by the contribution of hydrophobic and aromatic residues of the effector ´~ C-terminal loop (Lomonte et al., 1994a, 1999, 2003; Nunez et al., 2001; Chioato et al., 2002), which may partially penetrate and disorganize the bilayer (Fig. 4). Membrane fluidity might be required in this step, since in vitro cytolysis does not occur at 4 8C (Lomonte et al., 1994b). As first noted by Kini and Evans (1989), this membrane-damaging mechanism might be analogous to that exerted by numerous cationic peptides of the innate antimicrobial defenses (Hill et al., 1991; Hancock and Chapple, 1999). Finally, two additional factors that might enhance membrane perturbation would be the quaternary conformation changes through a molecular hinge, in the case of dimeric Lys49 myotoxins (da Silva Giotto et al., 1998; de Oliveira et al., 2001), and the potential acylation of these toxins, either via autocatalysis (Pedersen et al., 1995), or via an interrupted catalytic cycle that fails to release a free fatty acid (Lee et al., 2001). Membrane perturbation would be the key toxic event, allowing an uncontrolled influx of ions (i.e. Ca2þand Naþ), and eventually triggering irreversible intracellular alterations and cell death.

9. Future directions Although still many important details of the mechanism of action of the Lys49 PLA2 myotoxins remain to be established, significant advances have been made towards understanding the structural basis of their function. Their mode of action has now been understood in its more general concepts, and a consistent working hypothesis can be experimentally supported. But further molecular refinement of these general concepts will certainly come next, from detailed experiments using mutant and chimeric proteins, for example. Moreover, relevant clues
