In the crystalline state, ribonuclease T1 binds calcium ions at different lattice-dependent positions. In solution, its conformational stability is also remarkably increased in the presence of divalent metal ions. Combining urea unfolding studies and X-ray crystallography, we compared the presence of several metal ions at specific sites in the protein to their contribution to the overall stabilizing effect in solution. We constructed thermodynamic cycles involving

particular metal ions and specific carboxylate functions. The resulting coupling energies indicate that some (but not all) metal ions found at lattice contacts in crystal structures may indeed significantly contribute to stability enhancement in the presence of metal ions in solution. Keywords: conformational stability; metal binding; RNase T1.

Ribonuclease T1 (RNase T1) is a small, well-characterized enzyme excreted from Aspergillus oryzae. In an aqueous environment it cleaves the P-O5 H ester bond of singlestranded RNA specifically at the 3 H side of guanosine residues [1,2]. Over the years, a wealth of RNase T1 crystal structures have been solved. Many of these structures contain calcium ions at different lattice contacts. The relevance of these particular calciums to the protein's properties in solution has never been investigated. Nevertheless, the enzyme is remarkably stable at high salt concentrations. The first studies on the stabilizing effect of salts on RNase T1 were done by Oobatake and coworkers [3,4]. These authors measured an increase in melting temperature with 20 8C in the presence of 2 m NaCl. Moreover, the unfolding of the native reduced conformation can be prevented by the addition of salts [5]. Pace and Grimsley [6] suggested that the stabilizing character of ions on RNase T1 is mainly due to weak but specific binding of cations and anions by the native, folded conformation, rather than to an ionic-strength effect. In the present work, we set out to test this hypothesis. We have also investigated whether metal ions found at crystal lattice contacts can contribute to protein stability in solution. To analyze the contribution of particular ion-binding sites (identified by crystallography) to stability, we disrupted these sites using site-directed mutagenesis and

compared the conformational stability of the wild-type and the mutant enzymes in the presence and absence of metal ions. The coupling between the disrupting mutation and a particular ion was calculated using thermodynamic cycles [7,8]. We also determined the structure of RNase T1 in crystals soaked with different metal ions. By comparing the thermodynamic and the structural data, we found that particular metal ion-binding sites contribute to the conformational stability of T1. Other sites are not relevant to the conformational stability in solution and may be artefacts of the crystallization procedure.

Site-directed mutagenesis and enzyme purification The expression of recombinant RNase T1 has been described previously [9]. The Asp153Ala and Asp493Ala mutants were constructed using a standard PCR-based overlap extension technique [10]. The sequences of the mutant genes were verified by DNA sequencing. Proteins were purified to homogeneity as described [11] and their molecular masses were confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Urea unfolding experiments Urea unfolding experiments were performed according to Pace [12]. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance using A278  1.74 for a 0.1% solution [13]. Unfolding of RNase T1 was measured by following the fluorescence decrease at 320 nm upon excitation at 278 nm with an Aminco Bowman Series2 fluorimeter. Each sample of RNase T1 (15 mg´mL21) containing an appropriate urea concentration was incubated overnight in 30 mm Mops buffer pH 7.0 to reach equilibrium at 25 8C. Cations were added as chloride salts. Urea concentrations were measured by refractive index measurements. Urea denaturation curves were processed applying a linear extrapolation method-based fitting function [14], assuming a two-state

We calculated the conformational stability according to DG(H2O)  m´[urea1/2], using the experimentally determined [urea1/2]point and the average m  5.23 ^ 0.08 kJ´mol21´m21) obtained from all measurements. Crystallization and data collection Two crystal forms of wild-type RNase T122 H guanylic acid (2 H GMP) complex were used in this study. Form I corresponds to the `classic' crystal form of 2 H GMP-bound RNase T1. Many different point mutants and inhibitor complexes have been crystallized in the same form. The crystals of form I were grown as described previously [15] Ê and diffract between 1.9 and 1.7 A at room temperature on a rotating anode source. On beamline BW7B of the DESY Ê synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany), data to 1.23 A could be collected using a single form-I crystal at room temperature. Crystals of form II were obtained by repeated seeding starting from isomorphous crystals of the mutant Ê Thr933Gln [16]. Data were collected to 1.65 A at 100 K using a rotating anode source operated at 40 kV and 90 mA. In each case, a MAR Image Plate was used as detector. The details of unit cell and space group as well as the data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. All data were integrated using denzo [17] and subsequently scaled and merged using scalepack. The CCP4 program truncate was used to obtain intensity distribution statistics [18]. Soaking experiments Form I crystals were soaked in artificial mother liquor where CaCl2 was replaced by 100 mm MgCl2, SrSl2, BaCl2,

KCl, CsCl or EDTA. For reasons of crystal availability, these experiments were performed using isomorphous crystals of the Val163Ala mutant. This mutation is completely conservative (S. De Vos, unpublished results) and is not expected to have an influence on metal binding. Data were collected in-house at room temperature (resolution Ê 1.8±1.7 A depending on the crystal). Data collection statistics are shown in Table 1. Structure determination and refinement All refinements were carried out using the maximum likelihood function target function of CNS version 1.0 [19]. Refinement of form I was started using Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 5 bu4 stripped from all its nonprotein atoms and multiple side-chain conformations as the initial model. The starting coordinates for the form-II structure came from Ê PDB entry 1bvi, which is a 1.9-A room temperature version of the current structure. In both cases, an initial rigid-body refinement was followed by a slow-cool protocol in order to uncouple R and Rfree. All subsequent steps consisted of alternating rounds of positional refinement, B-factor refinement and electron density map interpretation. Bulk solvent corrections and anisotropic B-factor scaling were updated at each round. Refinement statistics are given in Table 1.

Ê to near atomic resolution (1.23 A). It is the most commonly observed crystal form for this enzyme and was previously Ê available to a resolution of 1.7 A [20]. Form II diffracted to Ê 1.65 A, contains four molecules in its asymmetric unit and Ê was previously available at a resolution of 1.9 A [16]. Details concerning data collection and refinement for both structures are given in Table 1. The overall structure of the protein has been described in detail before [21] and we will only consider relevant differences with previously available structures or between the five independent molecules. The main chain conformation for all five molecules is essentially identical (r.m.s. values for all main chain atoms Ê Ê ranging between 0.3 A and 0.4 A), with the exception of molecule C from form II. In this molecule, a single loop

(Ser96C to Phe100C) adopts a different, crystal latticedependent conformation. It is also the only molecule that has two entities of the inhibitor 2 H GMP bound to its active site, one of which interacts with the altered loop conformation. All other molecules have a single molecule of 2 H GMP bound, all essentially in the same conformation. In addition, the electron density of residues Ala1A to Cys10A in form II is ill-defined. This is most likely due to a partial reduction of the disulfide bridge between Cys2A and Cys10A. The reason for this partial reduction, which was never observed before, is unknown. Calcium ion-binding sites A total of six binding sites for calcium ions were identified in the two crystal forms (Fig. 1). Bond lengths and B-factors for the ligands are given in Table 2. The high resolution and good quality of the data allowed us to omit restraints on calcium-ligand distances during refinement. Therefore these distances can be compared with those observed in small molecule complexes [22,23]. For four of the six identified calcium ions, the calcium-ligand distances Ê are close to 2.42 A, the average observed in small molecules. For two calcium ions (Cal703 and Cal705), the ligand distances tend to be somewhat larger. For Cal705, however, a somewhat larger error is expected as it only interacts with water molecules. We will in the following paragraphs describe each of these calcium-binding sites (Cal105 in form I; Cal701 to Cal705 in form II) in more detail. In the form-I crystal of RNase T1 a calcium ion (Cal105) is bound to the side chain of Asp15 in a bidentate way (Fig. 2). This calcium ion is further liganded by six water molecules, resulting in a dodecahedral ligand geometry. Several of these water ligands make additional contacts with a symmetry-related molecule. This calcium ion has also been observed numerous times in isomorphous structures at lower resolution but is systematically absent in all other crystal forms of RNase T1. In two out of the four molecules present in the asymmetric unit of form-II crystals (molecules C and D),

a calcium ion is bound between the side chain of Asp49 and the main chain oxygen of Gly47 (Cal701 and Cal702; Fig. 3). The ion is heptacoordinated with pentagonal bipyramidal geometry. The interaction with the aspartate carboxylate group is syn-monodentate. The crystal environments of both sites are strikingly similar. They share a common lattice contact with Tyr45(O) of a neighboring

molecule. In addition, an equivalent water-mediated lattice contact is made with an aspartate side chain (Asp66 in site 1, Asp15 in site 2; Fig. 3). In molecules A and B, the crystal environment around Asp49 is different and no calcium ion is observed. In both cases, the side chain of Asp49 is less well ordered and adopts a different rotamer conformation.

Three additional potential calcium ions are found in form II (Fig. 4). Cal703 and Cal704 interact with waters and main chain oxygen atoms. Both have their ligands arranged in a pentagonal bipyramid. Cal703 mediates a lattice contact by bridging Phe50B(O) and Cys2D(O). Cal704 is not involved in crystal-packing interactions. Considering the lower electron density, the tetrahedral geometry and the presence of amide nitrogen ligands, a water molecule was identified at this position in molecules A, B, and C. In form I, water or calcium is displaced by the N-terminal amino group of a neighboring molecule. Finally, Cal705 is seen to interact only with water molecules. Its identification as a calcium ion is based primarily on the level of its electron density compared to the neighboring atoms. The ligand geometry is irregular, but the observed coordination of six is in principle too large for a water molecule. Calcium-ligand distances are also somewhat larger than for the other five sites. Cal105 can be substituted by other alkaline earth metal ions It has been known for some time that the calcium ion bound to Asp15 in form-I crystals can be substituted by zinc ions [24]. This prompted us to investigate whether we could replace Cal105 by other alkaline earth (group II) and alkali (group I) metals. In contrast to MgCl2 and SrCl2 soaks, all

Cal705 is only seen to interact with water molecules in its first coordination sphere. Color-coding is as in Fig. 2.

attempts to soak the crystals with KCl, CsCl or BaCl2 resulted in fast (within seconds) destruction of the crystals, possibly by binding of these ions to one or more additional sites involved in lattice contacts. Electron-density maps of MgCl2 and SrCl2 soaks on the other hand clearly indicated substitution of Cal105 as judged from the height of the electron density and small but systematic changes in the ion-ligand distances.

these data with calcium resulted in unrealistic B-values and large difference electron densities. No additional Mg21- or Sr21-binding sites were observed. It was also attempted to remove Cal105 by exposing the crystals for up to 72 h to artificial mother liquor lacking CaCl2 and containing up to 100 mm EDTA. The resulting electron density maps nevertheless showed Cal105 still to be present at full occupancy.

Divalent ion binding and conformational stability of RNase T1 in solution In order to establish whether metal binding to the carboxyl function of Asp15 or Asp49 contributes to the enhanced stability of RNase T1, we constructed thermodynamic cycles using wild-type and Asp153Ala and Asp493Ala mutants in the presence and absence of various metal ions. Metal binding at the C-terminal end of the a helix (Glu28Asp29-Glu31) [5] was also investigated with the mutant Asp293Ala. By comparing the conformational stability of wild-type RNase T1 with the mutants in the presence and absence of metal ions (Table 3), we obtained the stabilization energy gained by the specific interaction between particular metal ions and the carboxylate group.

Thermodynamic cycles are an excellent tool to determine the specific energetics between two interacting groups independent of the complexity of the context in which the interaction occurs [7,8]. In this technique, the two groups (in our case a side chain and a metal ion) are removed separately as well as together (Fig. 5), and the energetics of each of these changes are measured experimentally. By subtracting the differences in stability caused by the mutation in absence and presence of the metal ion, one obtains the coupling energy DDDG which, in the absence of structural rearrangements, equals the specific interaction energy between metal ion and side chain. These coupling energies for the interaction between several metal ions and the carboxylate groups of Asp15, Asp29 and Asp49 are given in Table 4. In the following paragraphs we will discuss the effects of the mutations on stability and metal binding. Asp15 When examining the wild-type crystal structures, it is clear that Asp15 is always well ordered. The van der Waals interactions, the hydrogen bonds and its position as an exposed acidic residue near the N-terminus of the a helix are the factors that have a positive contribution to the

Table 4. Coupling between the different carboxyl functions and a range of metal ions, calculated from the thermodynamic cycles. Each value corresponds to the coupling energy DDDG between the residue and the metal ion (provided as its chlorine salt) at the given concentration. Negative values indicate that the interaction between the side chain and the metal ion has a net stabilizing effect. The coupling energies have an error range of ^ 1.25 kJ´mol21.

conformational stability of the protein. On the other hand, as one of the 13 carboxyl groups versus only six basic groups, it contributes to an overall electrostatic repulsion on the surface of the protein which is known to cause a decrease in stability [25]. The Asp153Ala mutant, which is a little less stable compared to wild-type RNase T1 (Table 3), seems to suffer more from the loss of the stabilizing ions than it gains from the removal of an uncompensated charge at the surface of the protein. Factors other than surface charge may also, however, contribute to ion binding at this position. Asp15 is located at the N-terminus of RNase T1-only a helix. Secondary structure propensity and the interaction with the helix dipole may contribute measurably to the stability. For Asp153Ala RNase T1, we constructed the relevant thermodynamic cycles for different di- and monovalent metal ions. The calculated coupling effects (Table 4) are small and within the error range for high (1 m) and low (250 mm) salt concentrations. This indicates that if a metal ion binds to the carboxyl function of Asp15 in solution at all (Kd # 1 m), it does not measurably contribute to protein stability. Asp49 Asp49 has the most solvent accessible side chain in RNase T1, is not hydrogen bonded and cannot form an ion pair. However, the net electrostatic repulsion between Asp49 and the other charged sites means that the replacement of this aspartate with an alanine results in an increase in stability. Given that this effect disappears at pH 2.5 [25] and in the presence of divalent metal ions (Tables 3 and 4), it seems likely that an uncompensated negative charge at the surface of the protein can be a relevant destabilizing factor, a conclusion also reached by Grimsley and coworkers. Here again, we constructed the appropriate thermodynamic cycles in order to determine the coupling effects between the carboxyl function of Asp49 and the different

1m

metal ions. We measured all stabilities in presence and absence of 250 mm SrCl2, CaCl2 and MgCl2. The results are summarized in Table 3. For each of these salts a measurable coupling was noted. The lack of any coupling for NaCl (which was used as a control experiment) excludes the idea this effect to be caused by ionic strength or nonspecific binding of any positively charged ion. Furthermore, an obvious preference for Sr21 (< 4 kJ´ mol21) illustrates the significant specific character of the binding site. In total, it appears that RNase T1 contains a divalent ion-binding site involving Asp49 with preference for Sr21. Ion binding at this site stabilizes the protein considerably. Asp29 The polyanionic cluster of which Asp29 is part, was suggested to be one of the potential specific cation-binding sites of RNase T1 [5]. Both Asp293Ala and wild-type were used for coupling measurements via thermodynamic cycles. Results are summarized in Table 4. The removal of a carboxylate from a negative cluster at the C-terminus of an a helix is expected to be favorable in terms of stability. However, the Asp293Ala mutation destabilizes the wildtype protein by < 2.7 kJ´mol21. Moreover, we measured a positive coupling between the divalent metal ions and the carboxylate of Asp29 that is difficult to interpret. A possibility would be to involve a local conformational change in the Asp293Ala mutant. A definite conclusion cannot, however, be made in the absence of structural data on this mutant. Unfortunately, all attempts to crystallize Asp293Ala failed until now.

Fig. 5. A thermodynamic cycle to measure the interaction energy between a carboxylate group and a metal ion. For both wild-type and mutant protein, the thermodynamic stability is measured both in presence and in absence of a certain metal ion, M. This provides the measurements DGwt,0, DGala,0, DGwt,M and DGala,M. The interaction energy DDDG between the carboxylate group on the wild-type protein and the metal ion is then calculated as: DDDG  (DGwt,0 2 DGala,0) 2 (DGwt,M 2 DGala,M)  (DGala,M 2 DGala,0) 2 (DGwt,M 2 DGwt,0).

involved in lattice contacts. Fortunately, refinement of identical proteins in different crystal forms has taught us that these intermolecular interactions do not have a major influence on their overall structure. Specific details at or in the neighborhood of lattice contacts on the other hand can differ. It is not uncommon to find active sites or bound ligands at such contacts, and this has in some cases led to discussions regarding the relevance of the observed conformations. Some investigators argue that so-called lattice-induced conformations correspond to minority conformations in solution, which are nevertheless biologically relevant. Others consider them mere artefacts of the crystallization process. Given the fundamental nature of this debate, it is surprising that no experimental study has addressed this question. In the present work, we have, to our knowledge, for the first time analyzed whether an interaction that is crystal lattice-specific has any relevance in solution. By choosing the simplest possible ligand, a metal ion, we were able to construct thermodynamic cycles that measure the interaction between metal ions and specific amino-acid residues that are known to bind calcium ions in a crystal lattice-dependent manner. We conclude that the stabilization of RNase T1 by these specific interactions is small, but can be real. This is particularly true for the interaction of Asp49 with Mg21, Ca21 and Sr21. For Asp15, the evidence is much less strong. Monovalent metal ions, on the other hand, do not interact specifically with either Asp15 or Asp49. This is in agreement with the fact that they have not been observed at these locations in any crystal form. Similarly, no evidence was found for the specific binding in solution of any metal ion, monovalent or bivalent, to Asp29, a residue that is not observed in any crystal structure to bind such ions. The positive coupling observed for the interaction between Asp29 and metal ions is difficult to explain and may be a result of a local conformational change induced by this mutation.
