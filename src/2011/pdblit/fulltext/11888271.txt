ABSTRACT: Rivastigmine, a carbamate inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, is already in use for treatment of Alzheimer's disease under the trade name of Exelon. Rivastigmine carbamylates Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase very slowly (ki ) 2.0 M-1 min-1), whereas the bimolecular rate constant for inhibition of human acetylcholinesterase is >1600-fold higher (ki ) 3300 M-1 min-1). For human butyrylcholinesterase and for Drosophila melanogaster acetylcholinesterase, carbamylation is even more rapid (ki ) 9 × 104 and 5 × 105 M-1 min-1, respectively). Spontaneous reactivation of all four conjugates is very slow, with <10% reactivation being observed for the Torpedo enzyme after 48 h. The crystal structure of the conjugate of rivastigmine with Torpedo acetylcholinesterase was determined to 2.2 Å resolution. It revealed that the carbamyl moiety is covalently linked to the active-site serine, with the leaving group, (-)-S-3[1-(dimethylamino)ethyl]phenol, being retained in the "anionic" site. A significant movement of the activesite histidine (H440) away from its normal hydrogen-bonded partner, E327, was observed, resulting in disruption of the catalytic triad. This movement may provide an explanation for the unusually slow kinetics of reactivation.

The principal role of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)1 is termination of impulse transmission at cholinergic synapses by rapid hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh) (1). In keeping with this requirement, AChE possesses a remarkably high specific activity for a serine hydrolase, displaying a turnover number of 10000 s-1, and thus operating close to the diffusion-controlled limit (2). Determination of the threedimensional (3D) structure of Torpedo californica AChE (TcAChE) revealed that AChE contains a catalytic triad similar to that present in other serine hydrolases. Unexpectedly, it also revealed that this triad is located near the bottom

of a deep and narrow gorge, ca. 20 Å in depth, named the "aromatic gorge" (3). Reduction of cortical and CSF cholinergic markers, such as AChE and choline acetyl transferase and ACh itself, is correlated both with the extent of the neuropathology and with the severity of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) (4, 5). This led to the hypothesis that AD is associated with cholinergic insufficiency (6-8). This serves as the rationale for the use of AChE inhibitors (AChEIs) for the symptomatic treatment of AD in its early stages to elevate the levels of ACh in the brain, and thus to ameliorate cognitive deficits (9). The only approach approved so far for the treatment of AD is the use of AChEIs. Three types of AChEI have been employed: (1) classical reversible inhibitors, which are generally tertiary amines; (2) irreversible inhibitors, such as organophosphates (OPs), that covalently phosphorylate or phosphonylate the esteratic site of the enzyme; and (3) slow substrates, typified by the carbamates, that also react covalently with the enzyme (9). The drugs approved so far include natural substances, such as huperzine A (10), and galanthamine under its trade name Reminyl (11, 12), and synthetic compounds, such as tacrine under its trade name Cognex (13, 14) and E2020 under its trade name Aricept (15, 16). The alkaloid, physostigmine, was shown to display cholinergic activity, and it was subsequently demonstrated that this was due to its anticholinesterase activity (17). Elucidation of the chemical structure of physostigmine (18) was followed by rapid progress in the development of synthetic AChEIs, which was pioneered by Stedman and co-workers (19). The first synthetic carbamate to find clinical application was

Bar-On et al. ReactiVators. Hydroxylamine, pyridine-2-aldoxime methiodide (2-PAM), pyridine-3-aldoxime methiodide (3-PAM), and 1,1-(1,3-propanediyl)bis[4-(hydroxyimino)methyl]pyridinium dibromide (TMB-4) were obtained from the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (Aberdeen, MD). Others. Acetylthiocholine (ATCh), 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS), bovine serum albumin (BSA), butyrylthiocholine (BTCh), 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), Bio-Gel P-6, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), and polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG 200) were all purchased from Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Bio-spin disposable chromatography columns were from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). Acetonitrile for HPLC was purchased from Bio-Lab Ltd. (Jerusalem, Israel). Enzymic ActiVity. Enzymic activity was determined by the Ellman procedure (34) using ATCh as a substrate for AChE, and BTCh for hBChE. The reaction was monitored by following the change in absorbance (AU) spectrophotometrically, at 412 nm, in a Uvikon 940 spectrophotometer. The standard assay was carried out as follows. Appropriate enzyme aliquots were added to a cuvette containing 1 mL of assay mixture (1 mM ATCh or BTCh, 0.3 mM DTNB, and 0.01% BSA) in 0.067 M Na/K phosphate (pH 7.5). The reaction was monitored for 1 min. Measurements were performed at 25 °C unless otherwise stated. Inhibition Constants. The inhibition constant (Ki) for inhibition of TcAChE by NAP was determined using several different substrate and inhibitor concentrations. Ki was determined using a program that first calculated Km and Vmax at each inhibitor concentration. The value of Ki was then obtained from the intersection of the linear plot of Km/Vmax versus [NAP] with the x-axis, as described by CornishBowden (35). Bimolecular Rate Constant for Carbamylation. The apparent bimolecular rate constants (ki) were determined from the pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) for progressive inhibition at several inhibitor concentrations. Spontaneous ReactiVation. Enzyme was inhibited g95%. Excess inhibitor was removed either by dilution into 0.067 M Na/K phosphate (pH 7.5), by dialysis into that buffer, or by gel filtration under centrifugal force (36), using columns packed with Bio-Gel P-6 that had been pre-equilibrated with 0.067 M Na/K phosphate (pH 7.5). Column eluates (enzyme) were placed immediately in a water bath to control the temperature. Samples were withdrawn at successive time points, and assayed to measure recovery of enzyme activity. The percentage of reactivation was determined by comparison of enzymic activity with that for control column eluates, where the enzyme had been mixed with buffer instead of inhibitor, but otherwise treated identically. The apparent decarbamylation rate constant (k3) was determined from the fit of the exponential data points to a single exponential. Spectroscopic Measurements. The intrinsic fluorescence of AChE samples was measured in a Shimadzu RF-540 spectrofluorometer, with excitation at 295 nm, and emission measured at 300-400 nm. Binding of ANS was assessed as follows. Aliquots (2 µL) of 0.1 mM ANS in acetonitrile were added to 200 µL of 0.5 µM TcAChE in 0.067 M Na/K phosphate (pH 7.5). Excitation was at 390 nm, and emission was measured between 400 and 600 nm, employing a Shimadzu RF-540 spectrofluorometer at room temperature.

appropriately named miotine (Figure 1), due to its miotic activity (20, 21), and the Stedman laboratory carried out extensive pharmacological studies on miotine and its analogues (22, 23). Weinstock and co-workers (24, 25) synthesized a series of analogues of miotine in which the chain length and branching of the alkyl substituents on the carbamyl moiety were varied. Several of these compounds were less toxic, in particular disubstituted derivatives, and had a longer duration of action than physostigmine, which, at that time, had already been tested as a potential antiAlzheimer drug (26). The (-)-stereoisomer of the N,Nmethylethylcarbamyl derivative, rivastigmine {(-)-S-Nethyl-3-[1-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-methylphenylcarbamate hydrogen tartrate, SDZ ENA-713, Figure 1}, was selected for clinical trails, due to its 10-fold greater affinity for brain G1 AChE over peripheral forms of the enzyme, its chemical stability, its longer duration of action in vivo, and its good tolerability (27). It was approved by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in 1998, and by the FDA in 2000, under the trade name of Exelon, for the treatment of AD. In this study, we first characterized the kinetics of the interaction of rivastigmine with various types of AChE and with human butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE). To understand the structural basis for the observed kinetic phenomena, the 3D structures of the conjugate of rivastigmine and the complex of its leaving group (-)-S-3-[1-(dimethylamino)ethyl]phenol (NAP, Figure 1) with TcAChE were determined by X-ray crystallography. MATERIALS AND METHODS Enzymes. The dimeric form of TcAChE was purified from electric organ tissue of T. californica by affinity chromatography after solubilization with phosphatidylinositolspecific phospholipase C (28-30). The enzyme was stored in 100 mM NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, and 1 mM 2-(Nmorpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) at pH 6.5 and 4 °C. Serum hBChE (31) was a gift from Y. Ashani (Israel Institute for Biological Research, Ness Ziona, Israel). Recombinant human AChE (rhAChE) (32) and recombinant Drosophila melanogaster (rDmAChE) (33) were gifts from T. L. Rosenberry (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). ChE Inhibitors. Rivastigmine, its optical isomer SDZ 212712, N,N-ethylmethylcarbamyl chloride (EMCC, Figure 1), and NAP were from Novartis Pharma AG. Rivastigmine, SDZ 212-712, and NAP were dissolved in water. EMCC was dissolved in acetonitrile.

Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed in a Jasco J500C spectropolarimeter, using 0.2 mm and 1 cm path length cuvettes for near- and far-UV measurements, respectively. Azide-free samples of enzyme (0.5 mg/mL) in 0.067 M Na/K phosphate (pH 7.5) were employed. X-ray Crystallography. Trigonal crystals of native TcAChE were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method, using as a precipitant 34-38% (v/v) PEG 200 in 0.1 M MES at pH 5.8 and 4 °C, and a protein concentration of 11 mg/ mL (30). The drops contained 2 µL of a protein solution and 2 µL of a precipitant solution. The TcAChE-rivastigmine conjugate and the TcAChE-NAP complex were obtained by soaking the native crystals for 13 days in mother liquor containing 3 mM rivastigmine or for 5 days in mother liquor containing 2 mM NAP. Crystals were immersed briefly in high-viscosity motor oil (Exxon, Houston, TX), and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection at 100 K. For the rivastigmine conjugate, data were collected to 2.2 Å resolution on beam line X12C of the U.S. National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Upton, NY). For the NAP complex, data were collected to 3.0 Å resolution "in house" at the Weizmann Institute of Science, using a Rigaku R-AXIS-IIC imaging plate detector mounted on a Rigaku FR rotating anode. Data collection and statistics parameters for the two structures are summarized in Table 1. The structures were determined by molecular replacement using the 2.5 Å structure of native TcAChE [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 2ACE (30)] as a starting model, with no solvent molecules or attached sugars. The structures were refined by a combination of simulated annealing and molecular dynamics with a maximum likelihood target function, using the CNS program suite (37, 38). Refinement and model statistics results for both structures are summarized in Table 2. RESULTS Carbamylation of TcAChE by RiVastigmine. Earlier kinetic studies, performed on human erythrocyte AChE, treated rivastigmine as a slow-binding reversible inhibitor, with an apparent Ki of 200 µM (25). Although such an approach provides a useful, subjective comparison of inhibitor potency for a particular set of conditions, it is formally incomplete.

Scheme 1: Mechanism of Inhibition of ChEs by Carbamatesa

a The carbamate forms a complex with AChE prior to carbamylation, and decarbamylation proceeds through attack of water (under conditions where k3 , k2). EOH, enzyme; CX, intact carbamate; k1, rate constant for the formation of the reversible complex [EOH,CX]; k-1, rate constant for dissociation of the [EOH,CX] complex; k2, carbamylation rate constant; EOC, carbamylated enzyme; XH, leaving group; k3, decarbamylation rate constant; COH, hydrolyzed carbamate, a carbamic acid derivative; ki, apparent bimolecular rate constant governing the overall rate of inhibition and neglecting the formation of the reversible complex.

Wilson and co-workers demonstrated that carbamates serve as slow substrates of AChE (Scheme 1), with rapid carbamylation being followed by much slower decarbamylation (39, 40). Covalent reaction between TcAChE and rivastigmine was suggested by the progressive inhibition of TcAChE by rivastigmine (Figure 2, left). Inhibition was relatively slow, requiring millimolar concentrations of inhibitor to significantly reduce enzyme activity. The apparent ki for carbamylation was 2.0 M-1 min-1 (Figure 2, right). Decarbamylation of TcAChE Inhibited by RiVastigmine. To determine if rivastigmine behaves as a slow substrate of TcAChE, spontaneous decarbamylation studies were carried out. Unexpectedly, the inhibition of TcAChE by rivastigmine displayed very slow reactivation (<10% after 48 h) using the gel filtration method of reactivation. We attempted, therefore, to accelerate the reactivation of the carbamylated enzyme by several means. The addition of nucleophiles, after gel filtration, including hydroxylamine, and the oximes 2-PAM, 3-PAM, and TMB-4, had no significant effect on the apparent rate of reactivation. Moreover, neither extensive washing on Amicon filters nor dialysis of the inhibited

FIGURE 2: Overall carbamylation of TcAChE with rivastigmine. Pseudo-first-order inhibition rates (kobs) were determined by measuring the residual activity of TcAChE as a function of time in the presence of rivastigmine (2.5-30 mM). The left panel shows a representative determination of kobs at a single inhibitor concentration (10 mM). The points are experimental data, and the curve is a direct fit to a single-exponential decay. The right panel shows a linear relationship between pseudo-first-order rate constants and rivastigmine concentrations. The slope of this line is the apparent bimolecular rate constant.

enzyme for 24 h at 4 °C resulted in faster or greater reactivation of the carbamylated TcAChE. The fact that decarbamylation was slow compared to that of carbamyl-AChE conjugates produced by other carbamates (41) raised the possibility that inhibition by rivastigmine might induce a conformational change in the enzyme. Accordingly, spectroscopic experiments were performed to check whether inhibition by rivastigmine caused (1) exposure of hydrophobic surfaces; (2) a red shift in the emission peak for intrinsic fluorescence, which would indicate that the indole rings of tryptophan residues are more exposed to the solvent than in the native form of the enzyme; and (3) a change in ellipticity. No evidence for a substantial conformational change upon carbamylation with rivastigmine was observed by these methods, suggesting that the enzyme was neither fully denatured nor in one of the previously described catalytically inactive molten globule or quasi-native states (42). ReVersible Inhibition of TcAChE by NAP. The leaving group of rivastigmine (XH in Scheme 1), NAP, is a phenol ring bearing a tertiary nitrogen substituent. It has a structure similar to that of edrophonium, a well-studied competitive inhibitor of AChE (13). Figure 3 shows that NAP is a competitive reversible inhibitor of TcAChE with a Ki of 0.5 µM. This raised the possibility that the product of carbamylation might influence the interaction of TcAChE and rivastigmine. Kinetics of Inhibition of TcAChE by EMCC. To isolate the contribution of the NAP moiety to the kinetics of inhibition and reactivation of TcAChE by rivastigmine, we studied the kinetics of the reaction of TcAChE with the homologous carbamate, EMCC, in which chloride replaces NAP as the leaving group. EMCC inhibited TcAChE substantially faster than rivastigmine, displaying a ki value of 20 M-1 min-1. Upon dilution, complete reactivation was observed, with a decarbamylation rate constant of 0.03 min-1, and a t1/2 of 25 min (Figure 4). Addition of 2 µM NAP to the reaction mixture after dilution had no effect on the rate or extent of reactivation (Figure 4), and similar results were obtained when NAP was added before dilution (data not shown). Thus, failure of the TcAChE-rivastigmine conjugate to reactivate cannot simply be ascribed to stabilization of the ethylmethylcarbamylated TcAChE by NAP.

FIGURE 3: Reversible inhibition of TcAChE by NAP. The inhibition constant for reversible inhibition of TcAChE with NAP was measured using the method of a Km/Vmax plot (35) at seven different concentrations of NAP in the range of 0.15-1 mM. The results show that NAP is a competitive inhibitor of TcAChE.

Kinetic Characterization of the Action of RiVastigmine on rhAChE, rDmAChE, and hBChE. The kinetic results for the inactivation of TcAChE by rivastigmine were unexpected. To determine whether both the observed slow inhibition of TcAChE by rivastigmine and the extremely slow reactivation were species-specific, we extended our kinetic studies to other ChEs. rhAChE seemed particularly relevant since it is the in vivo target of rivastigmine as an AD drug. We also studied hBChE, and rDmAChE, the 3D structure of which was recently determined (43). Rivastigmine inhibited rhAChE very much faster than TcAChE at 25 °C. The bimolecular rate for inhibition of rhAChE was more than 1600-fold higher than for TcAChE (3300 vs 2.0 M-1 min-1, respectively), requiring a micromolar instead of a millimolar inhibitor concentration to reduce enzyme activity significantly. However, for rhAChE, too, no reactivation could be detected by the dialysis method, and only 25% reactivation was observed after 48 h at 25 °C using the gel filtration method (Table 3). Whereas TcAChE is relatively heat-sensitive (44), the thermal stability of rhAChE permitted us to perform experiments at the physiological temperature (37 °C). The bimolecular rate constant

for inhibition of rhAChE at 37 °C was 5500 M-1 min-1, and 60% reactivation could be obtained within 48 h (Table 3). Carbamylation of rhAChE by EMCC was too fast to be assessed by the progressive inhibition method, and rapid hydrolysis of EMCC prevented attempts to follow the reaction at lower reagent concentrations. However, EMCCinhibited rhAChE underwent complete spontaneous reactivation, with a t1/2 of 4 min at 25 °C (Table 4). The bimolecular rate constant for the carbamylation of hBChE by rivastigmine was almost 30-fold greater (9 × 104

M-1 min-1) than that of rhAChE (Table 3). As had been found with TcAChE, however, <10% reactivation of rivastigmine-inhibited hBChE was observed after 24 h at 25 °C. Again, the greater thermal stability of hBChE, relative to that of TcAChE, allowed us to perform reactivation experiments at a higher temperature. At 37 °C, reactivation of rivastigmine-inhibited hBChE was very slow, but went to >80% completion with a t1/2 of approximately 24 h (Table 3). Moreover, complete and rapid reactivation of hBChE inhibited by EMCC was observed (Table 4). The bimolecular rate constant for carbamylation of rDmAChE by rivastigmine at 25 °C was 5 × 105 M-1 min-1, and 75% reactivation was obtained within 48 h at the same temperature (Table 3). Kinetic Characterization of SDZ 212-712. Rivastigmine was originally synthesized as a racemic mixture, but it was subsequently found that the (-)-S-isomer is the more potent compound, which was accordingly taken for development as an anti-AD drug. We compared the kinetic properties of rivastigmine and of its optical isomer, SDZ 212-712, and indeed found that the concentration of SDZ 212-712 we had to use, to reduce enzymic activity of rhAChE and of rDmAChE significantly, was 10-fold higher than that of rivastigmine. The bimolecular rate constant values for carbamylation of rhAChE and rDmAChE by SDZ 212-712 are thus much lower, 30- and 45-fold, respectively, compared to the ki values for rivastigmine (Table 3). For TcAChE inhibited by SDZ 212-712, the ki value could not be determined, since we could not reach a concentration of inhibitor that was sufficiently high to achieve significant inhibition. Reactivation of rhAChE and rDmAChE inhibited with SDZ 212-712 was also slower than that of the corresponding rivastigmine conjugates (Table 3). 3D Crystal Structure of the TcAChE-RiVastigmine Conjugate. The overall crystal structure of the TcAChErivastigmine conjugate is very similar to the native TcAChE structure (rmsd of 0.26 Å). The structure in the vicinity of the active site is shown in Figure 5. As might be expected, the highest positive-difference density peaks were observed at the bottom of the active-site gorge. One peak is seen at a position near S200, within covalent bonding distance of S200 O (1.39 Å), and another in proximity to both W84 and F330. Neither peak could account for the full rivastigmine molecule, but the carbamyl moiety of rivastigmine fitted the density abutting the active-site serine, S200, and the hydrolysis product, NAP, fitted the density at the other site, which corresponds to the "anionic" subsite of the active site (13, 45). The covalently bound carbamyl refined well, with full occupancy and a low temperature factor, suggesting a

FIGURE 5: Electron density map of the TcAChE-rivastigmine conjugate. The map shows that both parts of rivastigmine, the carbamyl moiety and NAP, are retained in the active-site gorge, but detached from each other. Rivastigmine is rendered as a balland-stick model, with carbon atoms colored yellow, oxygen atoms colored red, and nitrogen atoms colored blue. Selected key protein residues in the vicinity of the conjugate are also rendered in balland-stick format, with carbon atoms colored green, and labeled appropriately.

FIGURE 6: Active site of TcAChE after inhibition with rivastigmine. Amino acid residues within the active site of AChE that may interact with the inhibitor are shown. Rivastigmine is depicted with larger spheres and thicker lines for emphasis. The carbamyl portion of rivastigmine is positioned to make two H-bonds (dashed lines) with the amide nitrogens of A201 and G119, as well as nonbonded contacts (dotted lines) with F288 and F290 in the acyl pocket. NAP, the aromatic leaving group of rivastigmine, remains in the active site of crystalline AChE. NAP is within H-bonding distance of three water molecules (large red spheres), as well as of the amide nitrogen of G118. Nonbonding contacts and - interactions with W84 and F330 are depicted as dotted lines.

stoichiometric (1:1) reaction between S200 and rivastigmine. The distance between the carbonyl carbon atom of the carbamyl moiety and the hydroxyl oxygen atom of NAP is 8.0 Å, thus supporting our conclusion that carbamylation had occurred, and that the NAP moiety had been detached from the carbamyl group (Figure 6). The refinement suggested only 80% occupancy by the NAP moiety. The carbamyl moiety is oriented with the carbonyl oxygen atom pointing into the oxyanion hole toward G119N and A201N (Figure 6), and the amino moiety toward F288 and F290 in the acyl pocket (Figure 6). The phenyl ring of the NAP moiety is stacked against the indole ring of W84 and oriented in herringbone fashion with respect to the phenyl ring of F330, thus interacting with the two aromatic residues implicated previously in quaternary ligand stabilization within the anionic site (13, 45). Its hydroxyl oxygen forms three H-bonds with three water molecules, two of which are among the conserved waters in the active site (46), and its amino nitrogen points toward the oxyanion hole, forming an H-bond with G118N. Comparison of the native TcAChE structure with that of the TcAChE-rivastigmine conjugate reveals a substantial change in the position of the imidazole ring of the histidine residue in the catalytic triad, H440 (Figure 7). Thus, the distance between H440 N and E327 O increases from 2.52 Å in the native structure to 4.01 Å in the TcAChErivastigmine conjugate, while the distance between H440 N and E199 O decreases concomitantly from 3.49 to 2.85 Å. Moreover, the position of the main chain (CR) carbon atom of H440 in the TcAChE-rivastigmine structure moves by 0.64 Å relative to its position in the native enzyme structure. 3D Crystal Structure of the TcAChE-NAP Complex. The 3D structure of the complex of TcAChE with NAP alone

was determined, to find out whether the location and orientation of NAP in the complex are similar to those seen when NAP is generated in situ, concomitantly with carbamylation by rivastigmine. In Figure 8, NAP can be seen at approximately the same location as in the TcAChErivastigmine conjugate, but in a different orientation. The three water molecules near the NAP moiety are not seen, most likely due to the resolution being lower than in the rivastigmine conjugate. The aromatic-aromatic interactions of NAP with W84 and F330 are retained as in the TcAChErivastigmine structure. The NAP phenyl ring packs at an angle of 45° to W84 with a distance between W84 C 2 and C7 of the NAP phenyl ring of 3.81 Å, and the ring of F330 is edge-on to the NAP phenyl ring, with a distance between F330 C 1 and C9 of the NAP phenyl ring of 3.75 Å. The hydroxyl oxygen of NAP forms a 2.82 Å H-bond with E199 O , and the tertiary ammonium side chain is oriented toward the acyl binding pocket and the oxyanion hole. The orientations of W84 and of the residues in the oxyanion hole and in the acyl pocket, in both the rivastigmine conjugate and the NAP complex, are similar to their orientations in the native enzyme (Figure 7). The orientation of the F330 phenyl ring, which shows a high degree of variability in the various previously determined AChEligand complexes (13, 16), is quite different than in the TcAChE-rivastigmine conjugate, but similar to those of the huperzine A-, edrophonium-, and TMTFA-TcAChE complexes (16) (Figure 7). The position of the H440 imidazole ring in the TcAChE-NAP complex is very similar to its position in the native enzyme (Figure 7), with distances between H440 N and E327 O and between H440 N and E199 O of 2.67 and 3.29 Å, respectively. Thus, binding of

Biochemistry, Vol. 41, No. 11, 2002 3561 types of ChEs because it reacts relatively poorly with TcAChE, whereas the carbamylation rate constants for other ChEs are rapid and more comparable with the rate reported for other carbamates. Finally, we find that decarbamylation (spontaneous reactivation) is unusually slow for all four ChEs that have been studied, with the carbamylated TcAChErivastigmine conjugate being the most refractory to reactivation. The X-ray crystallography experiments fully support and clarify our kinetic findings. Rivastigmine reacts stoichiometrically (1:1) with S200 in the active site of TcAChE to form a stable ethylmethylcarbamylated enzyme (Figure 6). This directly supports the model of Wilson (39, 40), which treated carbamates as slow substrates of ChEs. The structural basis for the unusually low bimolecular rate constant for inhibition of the Torpedo enzyme is not immediately apparent. If the bulky leaving group of rivastigmine is replaced with a chloride moiety, the bimolecular rate constant is increased, but only 10-fold, which still makes it more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for inhibition of rhAChE. The structures of the Torpedo and human enzymes are very similar (47), and no dramatic difference can be distinguished in the dimensions of the acyl pocket. Replacement of F330 with a tyrosine residue (Y337 in rhAChE) produces a mutant in which the 14 aromatic residues lining the active site gorge are identical to the homologous residues in rhAChE. Y337 was shown to increase the rate constant for the inhibition of recombinant hAChE by huperzine A (48). Therefore, we modeled rivastigmine into F330Y TcAChE to see if this might help to explain the different rates of carbamylation of the two enzymes by rivastigmine. Figure 9 shows that the tyrosine residue is located between the carbamyl moiety and NAP, unlike F330 that is close to and makes interaction only with the NAP moiety in the TcAChE-rivastigmine conjugate. The hydroxyl group of Y330 can make four possible tight interactions. These are with the nitrogen of the carbamyl moiety (3.26 Å), with the ethyl group of the carbamyl moiety (3.0 Å), with the methyl group of the NAP moiety (3.17 Å), and with H440 N (2.87 Å). To place Y330 in the model, we had to change the positions of both H440 and F331, thus pushing H440 back toward E327 (3.0 Å compared to 4.0 Å), and away from E199 (3.65 Å compared to 2.85 Å), causing less disruption

NAP produces no significant movement of the catalytic histidine. DISCUSSION The experimental data presented here provide novel kinetic and structural insights into the interaction of rivastigmine with TcAChE, in particular, and with ChEs, in general. First of all, we show that rivastigmine is a stereoselective, slow substrate of ChEs, not a simple reversible inhibitor. Second, rivastigmine shows a pronounced selectivity among various

Bar-On et al. double acyl pocket mutant of TcAChE (F288L/F290V), which converts the acyl pocket of AChE to that of BChE (52), produces susceptibility to inhibition by PMSF, to which the wild-type enzyme is completely resistant. The 3D structure of rDmAChE (43) reveals that the activesite gorge of the insect enzyme is significantly narrower than that of TcAChE. In particular, the volume of the lower part of the gorge in the insect enzyme is 50% of that in TcAChE. However, DmAChE has the ability to hydrolyze substrates with larger acyl moieties, such as butyrylcholine (53). Comparison of the TcAChE and rDmAChE structures shows that the catalytic triad, the residues forming the oxyanion hole, and the anionic binding site overlap well. However, a change in the shape of the acyl binding pocket results from differences in two important amino acid residues, F288 (L328 in rDmAChE) and V400 (F440 in rDmAChE). F288 and F331 in TcAChE form a rigid - stacking pair. The loss of the rigid stacking renders F371 (F331 in TcAChE) more mobile, thus enabling the insect binding pocket to accommodate larger moieties. Moreover, in the TcAChE-rivastigmine conjugate, the amino group of the carbamyl moiety, with its ethyl and methyl substituents, is oriented toward F288 in the acyl pocket (3.2 Å). When the coordinates of rivastigmine were inserted into the rDmAChE map (not shown), this interaction was lost. However, five new strong interactions between the ethyl group of the carbamyl moiety and F440 appeared to be formed. In addition, as in rhAChE, in rDmAChE, too, F330 is replaced with a tyrosine in the array of aromatics lining the acyl pocket, which might also affect the kinetics of inhibition and reactivation of rDmAChE with rivastigmine. The extremely slow reactivation of the carbamylated enzyme is a feature shared by all four ChEs that have been examined. Thus, even though the Torpedo conjugate is the most refractory to reactivation, with an extrapolated halflife of >500 h at 25 °C, even for the other enzymes, halflives in the range of 102-103 h can be estimated for reactivation at room temperature. The crystallographic data support the hypothesis that, for TcAChE, slow reaction is due to a synergistic effect of the ethylmethylcarbamyl moiety and of the NAP leaving group, bound to the anionic site (though at less than full occupancy). Reaction with rivastigmine resulted in disruption of the catalytic triad, apparently due to NAP causing a movement of H440 away from E327. Alternatively, the movement of H440 might occur by NAP orienting the transition state such that the N-ethylmethyl group crowds the histidine. Due to steric exclusion, the new orientation of the active-site histidine does not permit the approach of a water molecule to the correct position of the carbamyl moiety for nucleophilic attack. The ethyl group on the nitrogen of the carbamyl moiety, which is a relatively bulky group, makes this even harder. The fact that there is no movement of the catalytic histidine in the TcAChE-NAP complex can be explained as being due to the absence of the carbamyl moiety, thus allowing NAP enough room to be accommodated in the anionic site without causing any conformational changes. TcAChE inhibited by EMCC undergoes reactivation at a rate comparable to those of other dialkycarbamyl-ChE conjugates, as do the corresponding rhAChE and BChE conjugates. Furthermore, even if NAP is added to a preformed conjugate, reactivation is not substantially retarded. Thus, NAP either

The carbamyl moiety and NAP are depicted as large ball-and-stick models for emphasis, with carbon atoms colored yellow, oxygen atoms colored red, and nitrogen atoms colored blue. Selected protein residues are depicted in ball-and-stick format, and colored green. The dotted lines are the four possible interactions made by Y330. The hydroxyl oxygen may form H-bonds with H440N (N1), and with the amino nitrogen of the carbamyl moiety (N). Two other interactions are with the aminomethyl carbon of NAP (C9) and with the aminoethyl carbon of the carbamyl moiety (C3).

of the catalytic triad, which might result in both faster inhibition and reactivation. The observed differences in the rates of inhibition of TcAChE and rhAChE by rivastigmine are reminiscent of the observations showing that phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) does not inhibit electric organ AChE of either Electrophorus (49, 50) or Torpedo (51), although mammalian AChEs are inhibited well by PMSF, and TcAChE itself is inhibited well by benzenesulfonyl fluoride (51), which is smaller by only a methyl group. The differences in the susceptibility of the Torpedo and human enzymes to PMSF have been ascribed to a greater "breathing" capacity of the latter (51), and a similar explanation may hold for the differential susceptibility to rivastigmine. The differences in the interaction of hBChE and TcAChE with rivastigmine can be rationalized as being due to differences between the two enzyme structures (52). BChE has a more open active site. Thus, movement of the histidine residue may not occur upon carbamylation of BChE, and if it is displaced, it may have more freedom to flip back. Thus, the more rapid inhibition and reactivation can both be rationalized. Recently, Kraut et al. (51) showed that the

Interaction of Cholinesterases with Rivastigmine cannot penetrate into the anionic site of carbamylated TcAChE or, if able to penetrate, cannot act synergistically with the carbamyl group to disrupt the catalytic triad as it does when generated in situ. The fact that for all four ChEs that have been examined, reactivation of the conjugate generated by rivastigmine is extremely slow favors the notion that the catalytic triad is similarly disrupted in all four. Crystallographic data were recently presented showing that the nonaged conjugate produced by phosphonylating TcAChE with the potent nerve agent O-ethyl-S-{2-[bis(1-methylethyl)amino]ethyl}methylphosphonothioate (VX) similarly displays a disrupted catalytic triad (54). Whether a synergistic effect of the leaving group is involved in this case, too, is not known. In any event, it is not retained in the crystal structure of the organophosphonyl-TcAChE conjugate. Comparison of the TcAChE-rivastigmine conjugate and the TcAChEVX conjugate, both determined at 2.2 Å resolution, reveals that the catalytic histidine is mobile. H440 N moves away from its resting state partner, E327 O , in the TcAChErivastigmine conjugate and in the TcAChE-VX conjugate, by 4.01 and 4.52 Å, respectively, and is within H-bond range of E199 O at distances of 2.85 and 2.64 Å, respectively (Figure 7). After the TcAChE-VX conjugate has been aged, the catalytic triad is regenerated. Whether regeneration of the triad occurred concomitantly with aging, or was delayed, is not known, since aging occurred in the crystalline conjugate at 4 °C over a period of several weeks. Bartolucci et al. (55) earlier published the structure of a complex of the physostigmine analogue, 8-(cis-2,6-dimethylmorpholino)octylcarbamoyloseroline (MF268), with TcAChE. As in the case of the TcAChE-rivastigmine conjugate, inhibition appears to be irreversible, with no significant reactivation occurring over a period of days (56). However, no significant conformational change was observed in comparison to the native enzyme, nor was the leaving group retained in the crystal structure. The carbamyl moiety contains a dimethylmorpholinooctyl chain, which stretches along the active-site gorge, and irreversibility was ascribed to the presence of this chain, with the bulky dimethylmorpholino group at the gorge entrance, limiting access of hydrolytic water molecules to the active site. The conjugate of another physostigmine analogue, eptastigmine, which is now in Phase III clinical trials (57), and bears a free octyl substituent on its carbamyl moiety, does reactivate, but with a very long half-life of 11 days (56). Rivastigmine is a "pseudo-irreversible" inhibitor of AChE since decarbamylation is very slow (hours to days). Consequently, inhibition of AChE is expected to persist even after the drug has been cleared from the plasma. Tolerated doses of rivastigmine are 3-12 mg/day (58), and large clinical trials confirm that the agent produces clinically relevant improvements in cognitive function with minimal unwanted adverse effects on patients with mild to moderate AD (59, 60). The results presented in this report show a strong species dependence of the kinetic data for interaction of rivastigmine with AChE, necessitating caution in extrapolating from one species to another. Moreover, there are major differences between the results obtained in vivo and in vitro. The pharmacological profile of rivastigmine in vivo showed that it binds to BChE with a 10-fold lower affinity than to the G1 form of AChE (27), and that it selectively inhibits AChE in the CSF relative to both peripheral AChE and BChE (61).

Biochemistry, Vol. 41, No. 11, 2002 3563 Our in vitro studies clearly show that rivastigmine is a more potent inhibitor of hBChE than of rhAChE. Possible differences in molecular structure (e.g., degrees of oligomerization and glycosylation) between CSF AChE and both the peripheral and recombinant enzymes may be responsible for these differences. NAP, the leaving group of rivastigmine, is itself a competitive inhibitor (Figure 3). If NAP is administered orally to rats, no inhibition of brain AChE is detected, probably due to poor penetrability and rapid clearance (A. Enz, unpublished observations). However, it must certainly be generated at substantial levels in situ, concomitantly with carbamylation of brain AChE by rivastigmine. This might explain why maximum inhibition of rat brain AChE by rivastigmine was only 80-90% (A. Enz, unpublished observations), despite the almost irreversible action of the carbamate. Our findings that rivastigmine is not a simple reversible inhibitor and that its leaving group, NAP, also inhibits AChE suggest that more detailed studies should be undertaken to establish the best kinetic models, both in vitro and in vivo, as well as the individual reaction rate constants for this important drug. Employment of suitable mutant enzymes should also help to resolve some of the open questions. REFERENCES
