Checkpoint Activation: Don't Get Mad Too Much
The Mad2 protein is required to delay sister chromatid separation until all chromosomes have been aligned on the mitotic spindle. Two recent studies provide new insights into how Mad2 contributes to this remarkable task. ´ ´ ´ Peter Lenart and Jan-Michael Peters The attachment of microtubules to kinetochores on chromosomes is key to mitotic spindle assembly. Microtubules `search and capture' kinetochores in a largely stochastic process, making it impossible to predict when exactly a cell will have all of its chromosomes attached to both spindle poles [1]. Presumably for this reason, most cells do not simply rely on a `timer' mechanism that would initiate sister chromatid separation after a defined period of time; instead, cells directly monitor the state of kinetochores and delay anaphase until all kinetochores are properly attached to the mitotic spindle. This sophisticated surveillance mechanism is called the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) [2,3]. When the SAC is active, Mad2 and other checkpoint proteins associate with Cdc20, a co-activator of the anaphase-promoting complex/ cyclosome (APC/C) [4]. Cdc20 bound by Mad2 is no longer capable of activating the APC/C, and therefore cells are not able to initiate anaphase and exit from mitosis, because both of these processes depend strictly on APC/C activity [4]. How is Mad2 activated at unattached kinetochores? The `template model', proposed last year by Andrea Musacchio and colleagues [5], suggests that inactive Mad2 may be activated by interaction with an active Mad2 `template' at unattached kinetochores. This dimerization would activate Mad2 by inducing a conformational change, similar to how prion proteins propagate conformational changes from one molecule to the next. Recent work by Vink et al. [6] and Mapelli et al. [7] has now provided important additional support for this template model. Before the template model was proposed, it was already known that Mad2 is recruited to unattached kinetochores by Mad1, a protein that forms a tight 2:2 complex with Mad2 [8,9]. Surprisingly, structural studies showed that Mad1 competes with Cdc20 for the exact same binding site on Mad2 [10]. These studies revealed further that Mad2 exists in two distinct conformations, called `open' and `closed' [8,11]. When bound to Mad1 or Cdc20, Mad2 is found in its closed conformation (C-Mad2), in which two b-strands of Mad2 topologically trap Mad1 or Cdc20, like a passenger is embraced by a safety belt in a car seat [8]. In contrast, Mad2 that lacks these binding partners is present in the open conformation (O-Mad2). An obvious conclusion from these observations was that, during SAC activation, O-Mad2 has somehow to be converted to C-Mad2 which is bound to Cdc20. Surprisingly, however, both Mad2 confomers are rather stable and do not seem to be easily converted from one into the other spontaneously [5]. If the two forms are stable, how is the transition from O-Mad2 to C-Mad2 catalyzed to efficiently sequester all cellular Cdc20? Even further, how is it possible that Mad1 is essential for Cdc20 sequestration in vivo, when Mad1 competes with Cdc20 for Mad2 binding? The Mad2 template model proposes that Mad1 and C-Mad2 form a stable core complex at unattached kinetochores. This core then binds additional molecules of O-Mad2 through formation of conformational heterodimers between the C-Mad2 subunits of the Mad1­Mad2 complex and O-Mad2 (Figure 1). This interaction

would then somehow lead to conversion of O-Mad2 to C-Mad2 and its simultaneous association with Cdc20, resulting in the formation of Cdc20­C-Mad2 heterodimers and keeping APC/C inactive [5]. The template model provided an elegant explanation for a number of previously enigmatic observations. Nevertheless, parts of the model remained speculative. Vink et al. [6] therefore challenged the template model by testing several of its predictions. For this purpose, they developed an in vitro fluorescencerecovery-after-photobleaching (FRAP) assay using Mad1­C-Mad2 complexes that were immobilized on beads and assayed the dynamics of O-Mad2 and Cdc20 on this `minimal kinetochore'. They found that beads coated with Mad1­C-Mad2-CFP were stably fluorescent, but when photobleached, fluorescence did not recover, indicating that Mad1­C-Mad2 forms a tight complex that does not exchange with the environment. On the other hand, when soluble O-Mad2-CFP was added to non-fluorescent Mad1­C-Mad2 on beads, FRAP showed almost full recovery, confirming that O-Mad2 dynamically associates with Mad1­C-Mad2 complexes. Finally, when Mad1­C-Mad2-CFP and O-Mad2-CFP were used simultaneously, FRAP revealed two pools of Mad2, one that exchanges on the beads and one that does not. All of these properties reflect exactly what would be predicted from the template model, and importantly they are in perfect agreement with previous in vivo FRAP data [12]. The reconstitution of Mad2 dynamics in vitro is an important achievement, because in such a system the reactants and their possible reactions are clearly defined. This reaction network can be written in the form of a quantitative model that in turn can be fitted to the FRAP curves and used to determine biochemical parameters, such as off-rate of a binding reaction [13]. Recently, more technologies have become available that allow measurement

Figure 1. The Mad2 template model. Kinetochore Mad1­C-Mad2 complexes Stable are stably bound to unatMad1 tached kinetochores and thereby serve as platforms Stable to catalyze efficient production of Cdc20­C-Mad2 comC-Mad2 Dynamic plexes. Cdc20 bound to (t half=4s) Mad2 is unable to activate O-Mad2* APC/C and therefore prevents cells from entering anaphase until all kinetochores are attached to Cdc20 microtubules. Mad2 has O-Mad2 C-Mad2 two stable conformations: closed or C-Mad2 (red) is bound to Mad1 or Cdc20; Stable open or O-Mad2 (yellow) is the free form. The two conCdc20 formers do not easily conCurrent Biology vert to each other, but the transition is catalyzed by formation of a conformational dimer between C-Mad2 and O-Mad2 [5]. Upon binding to C-Mad2 O-Mad2 adopts an intermediate conformation (O-Mad2*) that can quickly and efficiently bind Cdc20 and switch to the `C' conformation [7]. As FRAP experiments revealed in vivo and in vitro, the O-Mad2­C-Mad2 interaction is dynamic: the half-time of recovery is w4 seconds, which corresponds to an estimated off-rate of 0.2 s21 [6].

question because numerous other mechanisms besides Mad2 activation have also been proposed to control Cdc20 stability and activity [17,18]. How do other components of the spindle assembly checkpoint, such as BubR1 or Bub3, fit into this model? These proteins are also known to interact with Cdc20 and might even assemble into mitotic checkpoint complexes that contain Mad2, but how these complexes are activated is unknown [19]. Finally, how do Mad2 and other checkpoint proteins actually inhibit Cdc20 function? Understanding these mysteries of the SAC will keep many of us busy for some time to come.

of biochemical parameters in live cells, such as FRAP, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCS) [13,14]. In all cases, full understanding of the underlying molecules and their reactions would be essential to properly interpret and quantitatively model the system [13]. Not the easiest, but one of the most elegant solutions to this problem is to reconstitute the system in vitro -- as beautifully exemplified by the work of Vink et al. [6]. Vink et al. [6] also used their in vitro FRAP system to test the effects of p31/Comet, a cellular inhibitor of the SAC [15,16]. It had remained mysterious how p31/ Comet functions, because it does not prevent Mad2's interaction with either Mad1 or Cdc20 [15,16]. Vink et al. [6] could now show that p31/ Comet, like a Mad2 mutant that lacks its carboxyl terminus (Mad2-DC) competes with O-Mad2 for binding to Mad1­C-Mad2 complexes. Thus p31/Comet inhibits SAC without affecting Mad2 binding to Cdc20 or Mad1, but rather by blocking the O-Mad2­C-Mad2 interaction, a mechanism that is well explained by the template model. Mapelli et al. [7] set out to test another key prediction of the

template model: does binding of O-Mad2 to the Mad1­C-Mad2 core complex change the conformation of O-Mad2 to help its binding to Cdc20? NMR spectroscopy revealed major structural rearrangements in O-Mad2 bound to C-Mad2 as compared to its free form. Upon binding to C-Mad2, O-Mad2 adopts a previously unknown intermediate conformation with a `loosened safety-belt' (O-Mad2*, Figure 1) that might allow `entry' of Cdc20 into the open structure of Mad2. The data presented in the two new papers [6,7] provide strong additional support for the template model of Mad2 activation. But many questions about the spindle assembly checkpoint remain open. For example, what is the rate of Cdc20­C-Mad2 formation in vivo? Would this rate be sufficient to sequester all cellular Cdc20 on time? Are Cdc20­C-Mad2 complexes only formed at kinetochores, or -- as suggested by DeAntoni et al. [5] -- can Cdc20­C-Mad2 complexes function as cytosolic templates that can themselves catalyze formation of new Cdc20­C-Mad2? Is the interaction between Mad2 and Cdc20 alone sufficient to explain how the SAC keeps APC/C inactive? This is an important

Cooperation: Close Friends and Common Enemies
The Prisoner's dilemma game has been a key conceptual tool for analyzing social behavior for over 50 years. A recent study shows how the spatial scale of competition in this game critically determines when cooperation can emerge. Bernard Crespi
A hydrogen bomb is an example of mankind's enormous capacity for friendly cooperation. Its construction requires an intricate network of human teams, all working with single-minded devotion toward a common goal. Let us pause and savor the glow of self-congratulation we deserve for belonging to such an intelligent and sociable species. -- Robert S. Bigelow, 1969, The Dawn Warriors

We are indeed a social and cooperative species. Throughout life we help to generate social resources, from freeways to journals to the internet, via collective endeavors and divisions of labor. But such cooperation is always permeated by conflicts of interest, because resources create opportunities to compete, and to cheat. One of the primary unresolved questions in biology, psychology, philosophy and economics is understanding the ecological and social circumstances that favor and sustain cooperation -- especially when cheating can often yield a higher payoff. Evolutionary biology has provided some clues to solving

the apparent paradox of cooperation, with myriad studies demonstrating how kinship, mutualism, direct and indirect reciprocity, and threat of punishment can often keep selfishness at bay [1­4]. But we have missed something crucial, perhaps because like the theory of evolution itself, it is so obvious and pervasive. We cooperate and compete in groups, at scales from local to global. In this issue of Current Biology, West et al. [5] demonstrate that the spatial scale of competition can drive the evolutionary dynamics of social interaction among non-relatives. In particular they show that sociality is favored when cooperation is more local and competition more global -- precisely the circumstances under which we first so-cooperatively developed nuclear weapons. This is a key insight because it integrates the theory of cooperation with the real-world structures of human grouping, and the real world now needs all the cooperation it can get. The tension between conflict and confluence of interest is captured in a classic method to study cooperation, a game first developed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher in 1950 as

a component of the RAND corporation's studies of global nuclear war [6]. Two parties may either cooperate or defect. The highest joint payoff is achieved via mutual cooperation, but each player could achieve an even higher reward if they defected while their opponent cooperates. In the 1950s, `cooperation' represented the restraint motivated by mutual assured destruction. Albert Tucker resituated this game of terror as the familiar `Prisoner's Dilemma' of whether two criminals held separately should either cooperate (remain silent about a joint crime) or `defect' (incriminate the other). The Prisoner's Dilemma game has become a touchstone for analyzing the evolution of cooperation, especially since Axelrod and Hamilton [7] held a computer tournament won by the strategy `Tit for Tat': cooperate on the first play, then mirror your opponent's previous choice. This strategy is initially nice, forgiving of reformed defection, and provokable to defect, but it can only sustain cooperation under special circumstances and it departs from realism in various ways [7,8]. West et al. [5] are the first to extend the structure of the Prisoner's Dilemma game in space, by adding a parameter representing the proportion of competition that occurs locally (in a small group of social partners) versus globally (in the population of players as a whole) (Figure 1). They have shown with an analytic model that as competition becomes more local, cooperation is selected against. This result
