Abstract Human C8 is one of five components of the cytolytic membrane attack complex of complement. It contains three subunits (C8, C8, C8) arranged as a disulfide-linked C8- heterodimer that is noncovalently associated with C8. C8 has the distinction of being the only lipocalin in the complement system. Lipocalins have a core -barrel structure forming a calyx with a binding site for a small hydrophobic ligand. A natural ligand for C8 has not been identified; however previous structural studies indicate C8 has a typical lipocalin fold that is suggestive of a ligandbinding capability. A distinctive feature of C8 is the division of its putative ligand binding pocket into a hydrophilic upper portion and a large hydrophobic lower cavity. Access to the latter is restricted by the close proximity of two tyrosine side chains (Y83 and Y131). In the present study, binding experiments were performed using lauric acid as a pseudoligand to investigate the potential accessibility of the lower cavity. The crystal structure of a C8·laurate complex revealed that Y83 and Y131 can move to allow penetration of the hydrocarbon chain of laurate into the lower cavity. Introducing a Y83W mutation blocked access but had no effect on the ability of C8 to enhance C8 cytolytic activity. Together, these results indicate that the lower cavity in C8 could accommodate a ligand if such a ligand has a narrow hydrophobic moiety at one end. Entry of that moiety into the lower cavity would require movement of Y83 and Y131, which act as a gate at the cavity entrance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

C8 is a subunit of the eighth component of complement (C8), which is one of five components (C5b, C6, C7, C8, C9) that assemble on the surface of pathogenic organisms to form a cytolytically active macromolecular complex referred to as the "membrane attack complex", or MAC [1,2]. Human C8 is composed of an  (64 kDa),  (64 kDa) and  (22 kDa) subunit, which are products of separate genes [3,4]. The subunits are synthesized in hepatocytes and secreted in the form of a disulfide-linked C8- dimer that is noncovalently associated with C8 [5]. C8 and C8 are homologous and together with C6, C7 and C9 form the "MAC family" of proteins [6,7]. All contain tandemly arranged N- and C-terminal modules and an intervening 40-kDa segment referred to as the MACPF domain. C8 is unrelated and is the only lipocalin among the 35 proteins in the human complement system [8].

Lipocalins are a large family of extracellular proteins that are similar in size (20 kDa) and have the ability to bind small, hydrophobic molecules such as retinol, fatty acids, steroids and pheromones [9­11]. Some lipocalins also bind to receptors [12,13], and a few form covalent or noncovalent complexes with other proteins [14­17]. Members of this family have a highly conserved fold consisting of an eight-stranded -barrel that defines a calyx or cup-shaped structure enclosing a binding site for a small molecule [10,18]. The -strands are connected by loops, four of which surround the entrance to the calyx. The opposite end is normally closed but there are exceptions where the barrel is distorted to provide access to a second ligand binding site [19]. Sequence diversity within the interior of the ligand binding pocket as well as in the loops enables lipocalins to display a conserved -barrel topology but have different ligand specificities and binding properties. We previously reported the crystal structure of recombinant human C8 produced in insect cells [20]. C8 displays a typical lipocalin fold that resembles a calyx with a distinct binding pocket for a small molecule. As in other lipocalins, there are four loops surrounding the opening of the calyx. Loop 1 is the largest and it contains C40 that forms a disulfide bond with C164 in C8. In lipocalins of known structure, the ligand binding pocket is often narrow and deep with hydrophobic residues lining the interior. The pocket can also be relatively wide and shallow with polar or charged residues located in the loops at the calyx opening. C8 is an exception in that it has both a relatively shallow upper portion that is positivelycharged, and an unusually large lower cavity that is lined with hydrophobic residues. The upper and lower portions are separated by two tyrosine residues whose side chains are in close proximity and form a constriction at the entrance to the lower cavity. It is not known if the lower cavity can accommodate a ligand since a natural ligand for C8 has yet to be identified, and a similar lower cavity has not been found in other lipocalins. The present study shows that the lower cavity in C8 could accommodate a ligand. C8 crystals soaked with sodium laurate revealed that the hydrocarbon chain of laurate penetrates far into the lower cavity. Penetration is accompanied by movement of the two tyrosine side chains at the cavity entrance. Substituting one tyrosine with tryptophan prevents penetration but has no significant effect on the ability of C8 to enhance C8 cytolytic activity. These results suggest that any natural ligand for C8 is likely to contain a narrow hydrophobic moiety at one end. Entry of that moiety into the lower cavity would require movement of the two tyrosine residues that act as a gate at the cavity entrance.
2. Materials and methods 2.1. Cloning of C8 and Y83W
C8 was cloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pET17b (Novagen) as previously described [21]. In this construct, the unpaired cysteine was eliminated by introducing a C40A substitution. The construct was also designed to contain an N-terminal initiation Met and a C-terminal 6xHis-tag. Y83W was created by overlap extension PCR using the C8 pET17b plasmid as

2.2. Expression, purification and crystallization of C8 and Y83W
C8 was expressed in Origami B (DE3) cells (Novagen) and purified from the soluble fraction as described [21]. Y83W was expressed and purified by the same protocol except that expressions were performed in Origami B (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen). Protein concentrations were determined using an experimental extinction coefficient of 1% = 17.4. Purified proteins were 280 prepared in 25 mM imidazole containing 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2, and used directly for crystallizations. Crystals of C8 were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 18 °C in buffer containing 0.1 M sodium citrate and 25­27% PEG 4000, pH 4.0. Crystals of Y83W were grown under the same conditions in buffer containing 0.1 M sodium citrate and 24­26% PEG 4000, pH 4.0.

2.3. Crystal soaks
Initial soaking experiments used sodium salts of the saturated fatty acids C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, C18:0 and C20:0 (Sigma) which were prepared as a mixture in methanol because of poor water solubility. Crystals of C8 were introduced into drops containing a 1:10 dilution of the above mixture in 0.1 M imidazole, 32% PEG 4000, pH 7.0. and allowed to soak for 3­5 days at 18 °C. Soaks using individual glycerophospholipids (Avanti) were performed similarly except the buffer was 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.6. Phospholipids tested were 1-palmitoyl2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 1-stearoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine and 1,2-dioleoyl-2hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine. For sodium laurate (C12:0) soaks, the stock methanol solution contained 9 mM sodium laurate and was used to prepare a 0.9 mM solution in 0.1 M imidazole containing 32% PEG 4000, pH 7.0. All crystals were flash frozen in a stream of nitrogen vapor at 100 K using an X-Stream Cryogenic Crystal Cooler from Molecular Structure Corporation.

2.4. Data collection and structure determination
Data were collected on beamlines at Argonne National Laboratory and processed with HKL2000 software [22]. Data collection and processing statistics are listed in Table 1. The crystal structure of C8 expressed in E. coli, although isomorphic to C8 expressed in insect cells, was solved by molecular replacement to compensate for slightly different unit cell dimensions using the latter structure (PDB 1LF7) as the starting model [20]. Once determined, the new C8 structure was used as a starting model for the C8·laurate complex and for Y83W. Model building and refinement was performed with Turbo Frodo [23] and CNS [24], respectively. The laurate ion was manually fitted into the corresponding electron density. R-factors of the final models are presented in Table 1 along with data collection and other refinement statistics. Superpositions were obtained with LSQKAB software from the CCP4 suite of programs [25].

2.5. Activity assay of C8 and Y83W
Human C8 and C9 were purified from plasma fraction III (Bayer Corp, Clayton, NC) [26]. C8- and C8 were separated by gel filtration in high ionic strength buffer [27]. C8 was prepared from C8- as described elsewhere [28]. Purified C8 (40 ng/mL) in isotonic buffer containing 5 mM imidazole, 72 mM NaCl, 0.15 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5% glucose, 0.05% gelatin, and 1 mg/ mL BSA, pH 7.4 was preincubated with an excess of C8- or C8 for 30 min at 25 °C. Recombinant C8 or Y83W was then added in excess over C8. Incubation mixtures were serially diluted, C9 was added, and samples were assayed for hemolytic activity toward EAC1­7 as described elsewhere [29]. It is noted that in these assays C8 must be used as the limiting component. Excess C8- or C8 is added to C8 to form a C8 control or C8·C8, respectively. Purified C8 (or Y83W) is then added to the latter complex in sufficient excess to saturate C8·C8 and form C8·C8·C8. The amount of excess C8 (or

3. Results In agreement with results obtained for human C8 produced in insect cells [20], the crystal structure of C8 produced in E. coli displays a typical lipocalin fold with four loops surrounding the opening of the -barrel (Fig. 1). Superposition of the insect cell and E. coli C8 structures confirmed they are nearly

identical with a r.m.s. distance between C- of 0.67 Å. C8 displays a ligand binding pocket with a wide upper portion that opens into a large lower cavity. Several positively charged residues surround the upper portion whereas the lower cavity is lined with hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2A). The entrance to the lower cavity is narrow and constricted by the side chains of Y83 and Y131. Four water molecules in the upper portion are within hydrogen bonding distance of the phenolic oxygens on Y83 and Y131. The structure shows no electron density in the lower cavity that would suggest the presence of a ligand or ordered solvent. The molecular surface shows that the deepest portion of the lower cavity lies directly under Y83 (Fig. 2B). The large size of the lower cavity is most apparent in Fig. 2C which shows the refined structure of a Xe complex that was used as a heavy-atom derivative in the initial crystallographic studies of C8 [20]. The relatively large Xe atom has been used as a probe to study cavities and hydrophobic binding sites in other proteins [30]. Such regions are usually devoid of ordered water and normally accommodate a single Xe atom. In the refined C8 structure, electron density corresponding to three Xe atoms was observed within the lower portion of the binding pocket. Occupancy of the Xe atoms varies with one showing high occupancy and a strong peak (30 ) while the other two show comparatively weaker peaks in the initial Fo­Fc maps with values at 10 and 7. Upon binding Xe, the distance between phenolic oxygens on Y83 and Y131 increases from 5.1 Å to 6.6 Å. The constriction formed by Y83 and Y131 suggests the natural ligand for C8 would have to be narrow and hydrophobic

at one end in order to enter the lower cavity. The positively charged residues surrounding the upper portion of the binding pocket suggests the other end would be negatively-charged. These features made fatty acids and glycerophospholipids attractive candidates to consider as potential ligands. To explore this, crystals of C8 were initially soaked in a mixture of saturated fatty acids and analyzed. The resulting structure showed density corresponding to a single laurate ion in the binding pocket, therefore sodium laurate was used to further characterize the ligand binding site. These studies were facilitated by the ability to express C8 on a large scale in E. coli. Crystals of C8 expressed in E. coli were soaked in artificial mother liquor containing sodium laurate, and the structure of a C8·laurate complex was solved by molecular replacement

(Table 1). A model of C8·laurate was refined to 1.8 Å resolution (Rworking = 20.8, Rfree = 23.0). Strong tubular density in the binding pocket corresponds well to a laurate ion and extends below Y83 and Y131 into the lower cavity (Fig. 3A). Positively charged residues at the entrance to the ligand binding pocket are now ordered due to partial coordination with the carboxylate group on laurate (Fig. 3B). This leads to an apparent narrowing of the upper portion of the binding pocket (Fig. 3C compared to Fig. 2B). Also, Y83 and Y131 have shifted with the phenolic oxygens now much further apart (7.8 Å). This shift is most pronounced for Y83 whose side chain rotates to allow the alkyl chain of laurate to enter the deepest portion of the lower cavity. Interestingly, the carboxylate group of laurate is represented by weak density in 2Fo­Fc and omit maps, indicating partial disorder. This suggests the size of the laurate carboxylate group is insufficient for full coordination with the positively charged groups at the opening of the binding pocket. Thus, it is likely the natural ligand for C8 has a larger negatively-charged moiety at its upper end. Crystal soaks were also performed with several mono- and diacyl glycerophospholipids, but with limited success. Crystals soaked with 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine diffracted to 2.0 Å. Weak density in the upper and lower portion of the pocket showed partial binding with an apparent coiled conformation of a portion of the C16 chain in the lower cavity (data not shown). Consistent with this was the presence of density for two conformations of Y83, indicating it moves to allow access to the lower portion of the binding pocket, and confirming that only partial occupancy was afforded. The disorder did not allow the ligand to be accurately modeled in the electron density maps. Attempts were also made to detect ligand binding in solution using the fluorescently labeled fatty acid derivative 2-AS (Molecular Probes) as a probe. Binding of 2-AS to C8 was observed and could be inhibited by sodium laurate in competitive binding assays (data not shown). However, experiments using longer chain fatty acids as well as a series of glycerophospholipids as competitors yielded inconclusive results. The apparent weak affinity of these ligands for C8

The upper portion is surrounded by positively charged residues (R42, R70, R100, R122 and K129); however only R42, R70 and R100 are ordered in the structure and of these only R70 is visible in this rendering. The lower portion is lined with hydrophobic residues, including F22, F27, W31, M64 and F92. The entrance to the lower cavity is narrow due to the close proximity of Y83 and Y131 side chains. The approximate volume of the lower cavity is 120 Å3 and was calculated using the program VOIDOO with a 1.4 Å probe [38,39].

substitution into C8. The Y83W mutant was produced in E. coli and its crystal structure determined. The structure is nearly identical to that of wild-type C8 with the exception that only three waters are present above the gate, and a there is a shift in the position of the fourth water which places it closer to Q81

necessitated the use of high concentrations, which produced false-positive fluorescence changes as result of 2-AS partitioning into lipid micelles. To demonstrate that Y83 and Y131 function as a gate to the lower cavity, the gate was closed by introducing a Y83W

(Fig. 4A). Also, W83 extends farther out into the pocket than Y83 (Fig. 4B and C). Y83 can rotate and move as laurate binds whereas modeling studies indicate movement of the larger W83 side chain is sterically hindered by the side chains of V103 and V105 within the lower cavity. A superposition of the C8·laurate structure on C8 and on Y83W shows the laurate alkyl chain would not have space to move past W83 (Fig. 5). This was confirmed experimentally; crystals of Y83W soaked with sodium laurate showed no density for laurate ion below the W83 and Y131 side chains. We have shown in previous studies that C8 is not required for expression of C8 hemolytic or bactericidal activity [28,29]. A noncovalent complex of C8 and C8 (C8·C8) expresses both activities, although at a much lower level than intact C8 (10%). When added to C8·C8, C8 will bind to C8 noncovalently and form a trimeric C8·C8·C8 complex [29,31]. The activity of this complex is comparable to C8, however the mechanism by which C8 induces this increase in activity is unknown. To determine if blocking access to the lower cavity affects this property of C8, Y83W and C8 were compared for their ability to increase C8·C8 hemolytic activity. Results in Fig. 6 show that both proteins enhance the activity of C8·C8 to approximately the same extent as measured by the amount of complex needed to achieve 50% lysis of erythrocytes. 4. Discussion C8 is unique among the lipocalins because its putative ligand binding pocket is divided into a hydrophilic upper portion and a hydrophobic lower cavity. Crystallographic studies of C8 revealed that up to three Xe atoms can occupy the lower cavity, which suggested the cavity could accommodate a relatively large ligand. However, the close proximity of Y83 and Y131 side chains at the entrance to the cavity made it

A 2-fold molar excess (2X) of C8 was preincubated with C8 and assayed in the absence and presence of a 300-fold molar excess (300X) of C8 or Y83W. C8- was mixed with C8 and used as a C8 control. C8 is the limiting component, therefore moles of C8 added are based on the amount of C8 used in the assay. The graph shows the average values from duplicate experiments and the standard deviation.

questionable whether a ligand could gain access. Our results indicate Y83 and Y131 can in fact move and provide access to a ligand. Occupation of the lower cavity by the hydrocarbon chain of laurate indicates that moieties which are long, narrow, and hydrophobic could potentially bind. The cavity itself is sufficiently large to accommodate a more bulky moiety, however entry into the cavity would require a conformational change greater than just the movement of Y83 and Y131. Residues that function as a gate and control access to the ligand binding site have been observed in other lipocalins. The ligand binding pocket in bovine OBP is one continuous cavity and the structural features are quite different from C8 [32]. However, as with the lower cavity in C8, there is no direct access for solvent or a ligand. Structural studies indicate Y83 in bovine OBP is positioned so as to shield the binding cavity from solvent. It has been suggested this residue may function as a door whereby rotation of the side chain would allow access. A similar function has been proposed for the corresponding residues Y83 in porcine OBP [33], and F76 in aphrodisin [34]. The distinction between these residues and Y83 in C8 is their location with respect to the binding pocket. In C8, Y83 pairs with Y131 deep within the pocket to divide the upper and lower portions, whereas corresponding residues in the other proteins block access at the entrance to the main binding cavity. Although features of the C8 binding pocket are now well characterized, one still cannot predict the identity of the natural ligand, or even the class of molecules that C8 might bind. Because it is a component of the MAC, it is reasonable to suggest C8 binds a ligand or ligand moiety associated with cell membranes, e.g. the acyl side chain of a phospholipid or an alkyl chain on bacterial lipopolysaccharide. However, if it were found that C8 bound such ligands, it would not necessarily mean these are the natural ligands. Many if not most lipocalins are capable of binding more than one ligand, and the ligands are not always structurally related, nor do they necessarily correlate with the physiological function of a particular lipocalin [11]. For

this reason, conclusions about lipocalin function based on ligand preference alone are considered unreliable. Molecular modeling can in some cases identify ligand candidates, however the fact that Y83 and Y131 move upon ligand binding means modeling predictions would be of limited value for C8. The backbone structure of C8 most closely resembles that of human siderocalin (Lcn 2, NGAL), a lipocalin exhibiting antimicrobial activity because of its ability to bind ferric siderophores and interfere with siderophore-mediated iron acquisition [35,36]. Superposition of the siderocalin and C8 structures yields a match rate of 75% and a r.m.s distance between C- of 1.4 Å for matching residues. Siderocalin lacks the large lower cavity seen in C8 because residue side chains occupy that portion of its structure. However, both proteins have positively-charged side chains located in loops at the calyx opening, and in siderocalin three of these (R81, K125 and K134) participate directly in siderophore binding. A similar positively-charged triad is found in C8 (R70, R122, K129), however binding and crystallographic studies using a panel of siderophores, including ones that that bind to siderocalin, failed to demonstrate specific interaction with C8 [37]. While C8 is the most structurally well-characterized MAC protein, its role in the formation and function of the MAC is unknown. C8 is not required for the synthesis or secretion of C8; C8 can be expressed independently as a recombinant protein in mammalian and insect cells [29]. Binding between C8- and C8 is likewise not dependent on C8; purified C8 and C8 can combine to form a noncovalent 1:1 complex in the absence of C8. C8 is not required for incorporation of C8 into the MAC nor is it required for expression of MAC cytolytic activity. Although only 10% as active, C8·C8 is an effective substitute for C8 in the MAC-mediated lysis of cells. Addition of C8 to C8·C8 enhances this activity by an as yet unknown mechanism. One possibility considered previously is that C8 may bind directly to membrane lipid to produce a more lytically effective MAC [20]. Although it still cannot be excluded, such a possibility seems less likely in light of our results with Y83W. Blocking access to the lower cavity and the putative binding site for a lipid acyl chain did not significantly diminish the ability of C8 to enhance C8·C8 membranolytic activity (Fig. 6). An alternative explanation for the observed enhancement is that C8 (and Y83W) may simply bind to C8 within C8·C8 and produce a trimeric complex whose conformation closely resembles that of native C8. Such an explanation would require that Y83W and C8 be equally effective in altering the conformation of C8·C8. Regarding this, we recently showed that binding of C8 to C8 involves at least three of the four loops located at the C8 calyx entrance [21]. Blocking access to the lower cavity by introducing a Y83W mutation did not alter the structure of the loops, thus one would expect the affinity of Y83W for C8 to be similar to C8, and that both would have the same effect on C8·C8 conformation. In conclusion, it remains to be determined whether a natural, small-molecule ligand exists for C8 and if so whether it utilizes the lower cavity. Our results indicate that the lower cavity could accommodate a ligand or ligand moiety provided

there is movement of Y83 and Y131. Importantly, ligand binding may require more than just movement of these two residues. Within C8, C8 is disulfide-linked to loop 1 on C8, which is located at the calyx entrance. The close proximity of C8 and its apparent interaction with other loops surrounding the entrance suggests that a conformational change in C8 may also be necessary to afford access to the C8 ligand binding pocket.
