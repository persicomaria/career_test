A series of naphthyl-based compounds were synthesized as potential inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors. Investigations of structure­activity relationships led to the identification of a series of naphthamides that are potent inhibitors of the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase family. Numerous analogues demonstrated low nanomolar inhibition of VEGF-dependent human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation, and of these several compounds possessed favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. In particular, compound 48 demonstrated significant antitumor efficacy against established HT29 human colon adenocarcinoma xenografts implanted in athymic mice. A full account of the preparation, structure­activity relationships, pharmacokinetic properties, and pharmacology of analogues within this series is presented.
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing vasculature, is an important pathway for normal embryogenesis, growth, and tissue repair.1,2 It is also involved in a number of pathological processes, including inflammation,3 rheumatoid arthritis,4 ocular neovascularization,5 psoriasis,6 tumor growth,7 and metastasis.8 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFa) and its receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR-2 or kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) and VEGFR-1 are key regulators of angiogenesis.9 The increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the VEGF signaling pathway has enabled the development of agents that can interfere with this process. Moreover, the concept of blocking the growth of a solid tumor by suppressing its blood supply via the inhibition of the VEGF pathway is now well established.7,10 Several

successful strategies for the inhibition of angiogenesis have been effectively demonstrated in preclinical and clinical settings. These approaches include VEGF soluble decoy receptors,11 antibodies directed against VEGF,12 and small molecules that inhibit KDR.13,14 Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF, has now been approved for first or second line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum and for patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.15,16 In addition, two small-molecule inhibitors of KDR, sunitinib (1)17,18 and sorafenib (2),19,20 have been approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (Figure 1). We previously reported the discovery of AMG 706 (N-(3,3dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-6-yl)-2-(pyridin-4-ylmethylamino)pyridine-3-carboxamide, motesanib diphosphate, compound 3), a potent inhibitor of VEGF receptors 1, 2, and 3 (VEGFR1­3).21 This molecule is being evaluated in the clinic for its ability to inhibit angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and is also under investigation for its potential direct antitumor activity by targeting platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit) signaling. Recently, we reported the discovery of 2-aminobenzoxazoles (Figure 2, 4) as a novel class of potent KDR inhibitors.22 Separately, we also disclosed the discovery of a novel series of pyridylpyrimidine derivatives as Tie-2 kinase inhibitors (Figure 2, 5).23 Interestingly, in this latter series several compounds were identified that displayed potent inhibition of KDR (i.e., 5, IC50 KDR ) 2 nM). In an effort to utilize this scaffold as a starting point to discover a new series of KDR inhibitors, an X-ray cocrystal structure of 5 bound to KDR was obtained. As illustrated by the cocrystal structures of 4 and 5 complexed with KDR (Figure 2), the binding mode of these inhibitors to KDR is similar (PDB accession codes 2QU6 and 3BE2, respectively). Of particular interest was the observation that both of these inhibitors force the protein to adopt a "DFG-out" conformation. This conformational change in turn enables the inhibitors to

project into the extended hydrophobic pocket, a lipophilic pocket that cannot be accessed when the enzyme is in the "DFG-in" conformation. Examination of an overlay of 4 and 5 revealed a number of similarities that could potentially be exploited (Figure 3). Good overlap was observed between the pyridine of 4 and the pyrimidine of 5, with both groups binding to the hinge region of KDR. The p-chloroaniline of 4 and the m-trifluoromethylaniline of 5 occupied similar areas in the extended lipophilic pocket. In addition, the overlay of the 2-aminobenzoxazole of 4 and the 3-aminobenzamide of 5, both of which occupy the hydrophobic pocket, suggested that a naphthyl or structurally similar unit could serve as a scaffold from which to build a novel series of KDR inhibitors. In order to maintain the critical interactions with the protein, we hypothesized that the resulting hybrid structure should retain the pyridine moiety from 4 to bind to the hinge region of the kinase while also preserving the amide functionality from 5 which not only would serve to

engage Glu 885 and Asp 1046 but could also project a lipophilic moiety into the extended hydrophobic pocket. It was anticipated that the resulting naphthamide (i.e., 6) could afford a starting point for a novel series of potent and selective inhibitors of KDR with improved properties over those observed for the parent aminobenzoxazoles (4)24 and pyridylpyrimidines (5).25 Herein, we describe the synthesis, structure­activity relationships (SAR), and pharmacological characterization of naphthamides, a new series of potent KDR inhibitors.26 Chemistry Our strategy for the construction of the naphthamides described in this paper is outlined in the retrosynthetic analysis shown in Scheme 1.26 Naphthamides 7 and related compounds were prepared via activation of the carboxylic acid 8 and subsequent reaction with the desired amine R1NH2. Carboxylic acid 8 was in turn accessed via coupling of 6-hydroxynaphthoic acid (10) or a related derivative (i.e., 9) with the desired

heterocycle. This concise modular route allowed for the efficient construction of the desired naphthamides and rapid exploration of the SAR. The 6-hydroxynaphthoic acid derivatives and related bicyclic units were either obtained from commercial sources (10) or prepared (12, 15, 18, and 21) as outlined in Scheme 2. 5-Fluoro6-hydroxynaphthoic acid (12) was synthesized in three steps

from 6-hydroxynaphthoic acid (10) starting with the conversion of the carboxylic acid to the corresponding methyl ester.27 Subsequent fluorination with 1-chloromethyl-4-fluoro-1,4diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bis-tetrafluoroborate proceeded in a regioselective fashion to afford 11 in modest yield. Hydrolysis of the methyl ester yielded the desired naphthoic acid 12 in nearly quantitative yield. 7-Hydroxyquinoline-4-carboxylic acid

(15) was accessed from 4-chloro-7-methoxyquinoline (13) in two steps. Palladium-mediated carbonylation of 13 yielded 14 which following exposure to BBr3 gave rise to acid 15. Isoquinoline 18 was prepared from diethylacetal glyoxalic acid (16) via coupling with 2-bromobenzylamine followed by in situ cyclization to afford 8-bromo-3-hydroxyisoquinoline (17) in good yield. Subsequent palladium-mediated carbonylation yielded the desired methyl ester 18. Finally, aminonapthyl 21 was derived from methyl 6-hydroxynaphthoate (19) via triflate 20, which underwent a palladium-mediated amination with benzophenone immine. Hydrolysis of the derived immine provided aniline 21. The heterocycles employed as linker binder elements in our naphthamides were obtained from commercial sources, prepared as previously described,28 or prepared by the methods outlined in Scheme 3 (25, 27). Quinoline 25 was synthesized in four steps starting with the condensation of methyl 4-amino-2methoxybenzoate (22) with Meldrum's acid in isopropanol to afford enamide 23. Subsequent heating of 23 at 240 °C triggered intramolecular cyclization to give quinolone 24, which upon chlorination of the ketone and aminolysis of the methyl ester led to the desired chloroquinoline 25. 4-Fluoro-6,7-dimethoxyquinoline (27) was prepared from commercially available 4-chloroquinoline (26) by nucleophilic aromatic substitution using tetrabutylphosphonium fluoride hydrofluoride under microwave (MW) irradiation. The various building blocks could be combined to form the desired naphthoic acid intermediates or related compounds as shown in Schemes 4 and 5. Scheme 4 illustrates the synthesis of inhibitors centered around an unmodified naphthyl core. Biaryl ethers 29a-e were obtained by nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) of the corresponding heteroaryl chloride 28 with 6-hydroxynaphthoic acid (10) in the presence of cesium carbonate at 140 °C (Scheme 4, reaction 1). The construction of 3-fluoroquinoline derivative 29f was achieved by the palladium-mediated coupling of 6-hydroxynaphthoic acid (10) and 6,7-dimethoxy-3-fluoro-4-chloroquinoline because coupling of these two partners under standard nucleophilic aromatic substitution conditions led to unselective addition at the 3 and 4 positions of the quinoline.28 Pyridine and pyrimidine containing compounds 31a-d and 34a-c were obtained in a manner similar to that described above wherein formation of the aryl

ether was achieved utilizing SNAr chemistry (Scheme 4, reactions 2 and 3). The latter compounds (34a-c), which encompass an aminopyridine or aminopyrimidine moiety, were accessed in two steps from the appropriate dichloropyridine or pyrimidine by treatment with cesium carbonate followed by reaction with methylamine. The construction of inhibitors wherein the central naphthyl ring was modified is illustrated in Scheme 5. Preparation of the 5-fluoro-1-naphthoic acid derivative 36a and the 7-quinoline4-carboxylic acid 36c were achieved using the SNAr conditions described above. The preparation of isoquinoline 36b required the use of the more reactive 4-fluoro-6,7-dimethoxyquinoline (27) because low yields were obtained when the less reactive 4-chloro-6,7-dimethoxyquinoline (35) was employed. In the event, coupling of isoquinoline 18 and 27 in the presence of cesium carbonate with microwave irradiation afforded the corresponding biaryl ether which after in situ hydrolysis of the methyl ester provided acid 36c (Scheme 5, reaction 1). Construction of the biarylamine core (37a,b) occurred most smoothly when acidic conditions were employed. Thus, 6-aminonaphthoyl derivative 21 was heated with 6,7-dimethoxyquinoline (35) and trifluoroacetic acid in isopropanol to afford the corresponding biarylamine (Scheme 5, reaction 2). The derived amine could be advanced to aniline 37a by hydrolysis of the methyl ester. Alternatively, alkylation of the derived aniline by exposure to sodium hydride and methyl iodide followed by hydrolysis furnished 37b. Scheme 6 outlines the completion of the synthesis of the naphthamides and related compounds 39. Amide bond construction was accomplished either by treatment of the appropriate acid (i.e., 38) with the desired amine in the presence of an activating agent (i.e., HATU, TBTU, or EDCI) or by conversion of the acid to the corresponding acid chloride and subsequent reaction with the desired amine. Results and Discussion Structure­Activity Relationships (SAR). The in vitro enzymatic activity of all compounds was assessed using a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay with the catalytic domain of KDR. Potency at the cellular level was evaluated by determining the inhibition of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation induced by VEGF, an assay that is carried out in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). As a cellular selectivity screen used to assess inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor receptor (bFGFR) and downstream kinases that participate in the angiogenic signaling cascade, inhibition of HUVEC proliferation driven by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was also measured. While bFGF is known to be an important growth factor involved in angiogenesis, the use of a bFGF-driven HUVEC proliferation assay as a selectivity screen would allow for a more direct correlation between VEGFR-2 inhibition and the observed pharmacology. To test our original hypothesis, compound 6 was evaluated for enzyme and cell activity. Naphthamide 6 inhibited KDR with an IC50 of 3 nM and the VEGF driven proliferation of HUVECs with an IC50 of 210 nM. This enzymatic and cellular potency was combined with an encouraging selectivity at the cellular level (bFGF-HUVEC IC50 > 1100 nM). This initial promising result led us to explore variations of the pyridyl moiety binding to the hinge region while maintaining the N-4chlorophenylnaphthamide functionality. The enzyme potencies as well as cellular activities are summarized in Table 1. Within the N-4-chlorophenylnaphthamide series, the enzyme tolerated the incorporation of a variety of monocyclic (6, 40­44)

and bicyclic (45­51) heterocycles (Table 1). Removal of the carboxamide group led to a 6-fold reduction in enzyme potency (6 vs 40), presumably because of the loss of the hydrogen-bond interaction between the NH of the carboxamide and the carbonyl of Cys919 in the hinge region of KDR. The inclusion of a heterocycle with a suitably placed hydrogen bond donor to interact with the hinge region of KDR provided improved potency. This trend is exemplified by 41 and 46, wherein it is the C8 proton of the quinoline ring in 46 that is engaged with the carbonyl of Cys919.29 Pyrimidine 42 was the only analogue

examined that displayed substantially reduced enzymatic activity. While pyridine 40 and 2-substituted pyridines 6 and 41 displayed potent inhibition at the enzyme level, these compounds exhibited a 12- to 70-fold enzyme to cell shift. The 2-substituted and 5-substituted aminomethylpyrimidine derivatives 43 and 44 were slightly less potent at the enzymatic level but exhibited a smaller enzyme to cell shift than the corresponding pyridine (41). The fusion of a second ring obtained by closing the 6-aminomethylpyrimidine 44 to the corresponding 7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine provided 45. This modification led to an inhibitor with similar inhibition of KDR but improved cellular potency compared to the 6-aminomethylpyrimidine 44, 37 nM vs 106 nM. Furthermore, 6,6-fused bicycles 46­48 and 50, 51 afforded single digit nanomolar inhibitors of KDR. Quinoline derivatives bearing a 6 and/or 7 substituent (s) (47, 48, and 50) provided compounds that inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation of HUVEC with IC50 < 10 nM with a high degree of selectivity (100-fold) over bFGF-induced proliferation. Other modifications included the 3-F quinoline 49, which resulted in a 40-fold loss in activity compared with 48, and quinazoline 51, which proved to be slightly more potent than 48 at the cellular level while maintaining selectivity. Having established the 6,7-dimethoxyquinoline as one of the more favorable heterocycles to bind to the hinge region of KDR, we turned our attention toward modifications of the arylamide

occupying the extended hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme. A number of alterations were made to explore the effects on enzyme inhibition, cellular activity, and selectivity; the results of these studies are detailed in Table 2. Removal of the p-Cl substituent from 48 provided phenylnaphthamide 52, which retained its potency against KDR. The incorporation of substituents on the phenyl ring (53­63) did not significantly impact the enzyme­inhibitory activity (0.3­2 nM). In this regard,

increasing the size and placement of substituents on the phenylnaphthamide had very little impact on enzyme inhibition. However, cellular potency was more sensitive to modifications in this region as is observed by the range of cellular activity displayed by 53­63 (2-247 nM). While small lipophilic groups such as chlorine (48, 56) and methyl (57) did not significantly impact the enzyme to cell shift (2- to 16-fold), larger and/or more lipophilic groups, such as tert-butyl (60) and trifluoromethyl (58, 59) led to decreased cell potency, despite promising enzyme activity. With the exception of 58­60 and 62, all of the phenyl substituted naphthamides demonstrated >75 fold selectivity at the cellular level. The preparation of a more diverse group of naphthamides was next pursued, and several heteroaromatic rings (64­71), cycloalkyl groups (72­75), and small alkyl groups (76, 77) were incorporated into the inhibitors. The heteroaryl derivatives 64­70 exhibited enzyme and cellular activities comparable to the substituted phenyl compounds. It is noteworthy that pyridyl derivatives 64­66 were tolerated in the extended hydrophobic region of the enzyme. While isoxazole 69 exhibited favorable cellular activity, erosion of selectivity at the cellular level was observed; however, 3-methylisoxazolyl derivative 70 demonstrated potent and selective inhibition at the cellular level. Cycloalkylamides 72­75 were also well tolerated, though some loss of potency was observed with methylcyclopropyl 73. Interestingly, the cyclopropyl derivative 72 achieved remarkable enzyme and cellular potency.30 Small alkyl groups such as

n-propyl and isopropyl were also well tolerated, as demonstrated by the enzyme and cellular potency of compounds 76 and 77. Cognizant of the inherent metabolic activation liabilities potentially associated with the naphthyl residue, modifications of the central bicyclic aromatic core were explored (Table 3). Inclusion of a fluorine at the 5-position of the naphthoyl moiety afforded 78, a potent KDR inhibitor with impressive cellular potency and selectivity. An alternative approach involved the incorporation of a heteroatom into the naphthyl ring and led to quinoline 79 and isoquinoline 80. While quinoline 79 was 40fold less potent than 48 at the enzymatic level, it exhibited no enzyme to cell shift and retained cellular potency. The selectivity of 79 at the cellular level was decreased in comparison with

the corresponding naphthyl derivatives. Isoquinoline 80 displayed reduced enzymatic and cellular potency and yet did not inhibit bFGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation. These findings suggest that the lipophilic pocket of KDR is more sensitive and less tolerant of variation when compared to the extended lipophilic pocket. As summarized in Table 4, a brief examination of modifications to the tether that serves to link the naphthyl ring and the heterocycle binding the hinge region revealed that alteration to this tether has a dramatic effect on KDR inhibition. Replacement of the ether linkage in 48 with the amine tether in 81 resulted in less than 2-fold decrease in cell potency but an almost 10fold loss in selectivity. Furthermore, methylation of this amine provided 82, which displayed a further 140-fold reduction of activity on KDR. The disparity between 81 and 82 may arise from the methyl group on the amine disrupting the coplanarity of the quinoline and naphthyl rings by generating a steric clash between the N-methyl group and the C5 hydrogen on the quinoline. Pharmacokinetic Profiles. After the features necessary for potent and selective KDR inhibitors were established, the pharmacokinetic profiles of several compounds were evaluated (Table 5). Compounds 48, 64­66, 70, and 78 all exhibited low to moderate intrinsic clearance in rat (RLM) and human (HLM) liver microsomes. Given the propensity of nitrogen containing heterocycles to bind to the heme of cytochrome P450, this set of compounds was screened against the 3A4 and 2D6 isoforms. With the exception of the pyridyl-containing compounds (64­66), no significant levels of Cyp inhibition were observed. However, the 4-pyridyl derivative 66 strongly inhibited both 3A4 and 2D6 Cyp isoenzymes with estimated IC50 values of 100 and 700 nM, respectively. The position of the nitrogen in the ring had a dramatic effect on the inhibitory activity at the 3A4 and 2D6 isoforms, and the 2-pyridyl derivative 64 had a favorable profile with IC50 values above 10 µM.

Consistent with their low in vitro metabolic turnover in RLM, the naphthamides examined were cleared at low to moderate rates after dosing to male Sprague­Dawley rats. The highest rates of clearance were observed for 3-pyridyl 65 and 3-methyl5-isoxazolyl 70 at 0.9 and 1.3 (L/h)/kg, respectively. All of the compounds examined demonstrated acceptable bioavailability and suitable half-lives.31 The extended mean retention time (MRT) exhibited by compounds 48 and 78 (24 and 17 h) is a

reflection of the low clearance (0.1­0.2 (L/h)/kg) and moderate to high Vss (2.4­7.3 L/kg) exhibited by these two compounds. To assess the potential for metabolic activation of the naphthamide moiety of 48, 14C labeled 48 was synthesized and incubated with human liver microsomes.32,33 No significant levels of covalent binding were observed (<100 (pM/mg)/h). On the basis of its impressive in vitro profile and rat pharmacokinetics, an expanded PK profile of compound 48 across species was obtained. As illustrated in Table 6, compound 48 demonstrated low clearance and acceptable oral bioavailability in mouse, dog, and monkey (cynomolgous). Analogous to the pharmacokinetics that compound 48 exhibited in rats, the low clearance and high volume of distribution were observed across all species and in turn gave rise to extended MRTs (22­66 h). The measured plasma protein binding of compound 48 in rat, mouse, dog, and human was 98.0%, 98.6%, 97.4%, and 99.3%, respectively.

Selectivity Profile. Prior to an in vivo pharmacological evaluation of compound 48, the kinase selectivity profile was examined. As shown by the heat map in Figure 4, 48 was a pan VEGFR inhibitor displaying an IC50 value of 0.5 nM for VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and 2.0 nM for VEGFR-3 (Flt-4). Compound 48 exhibited selectivity over a variety of tyrosine and serine/ threonine kinases (500-fold: IGF-1R, CDK1, CDK5, JNK, BTK, etc.).34 More importantly, compound 48 was selective against numerous receptor tyrosine kinases implicated in angiogenic processes. Toward this end, compound 48 was highly selective against FGFR1, c-Met, and Tie-2 while it showed modest activity against PDGFR- . Consistent with the kinome, 48 strongly inhibited the VEGF-related kinases PDGFR- , c-Kit, and c-Fms. The implication of the potency of 48 against other kinases was further examined at the cellular level (Table 7). In addition to VEGF driven HUVEC proliferation, 48 inhibited the proliferation of Balb/c3T3 cells stimulated with CSF-1 and of NHDF cells stimulated with PDGF, in agreement with its inhibitory activity on c-FMS and PDGFR, respectively. However, inhibition of FGFR-2, Lck, Aurora B (Aurora 1), and b-Raf did not translate into any significant cellular activity. X-Ray Structural Analysis. In an effort to confirm the binding elements responsible for the observed potency and to substantiate our original design hypothesis, an X-ray cocrystal structure of KDR with naphthamide 48 was obtained. As illustrated in Figure 5, 48 bound to the ATP binding site of KDR and forced the protein to adopt a "DFG-out" conformation, enabling the p-chlorophenyl ring to penetrate into the extended hydrophobic pocket (PDB accession code 3B8Q). A highly conserved hydrogen-bond interaction between the backbone amide-NH of Cys919 and the nitrogen of the quinoline ring anchors the inhibitor to the hinge region of the binding pocket and orients the naphthyl ring into the hydrophobic pocket. The carbonyl and NH groups of the amide form critical hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of Asp1046 and the side chain of Glu885, respectively.

Pharmacodynamic Profile. The in vivo inhibitory activity of compound 48 for the VEGF RTK was assessed by measuring the inhibition of murine KDR (Flk-1) phosphorylation in mouse lungs. In addition, the in vivo pharmacological properties of compound 48 were evaluated in a VEGF-induced vascular permeability assay, a VEGF-induced rat corneal angiogenesis model, and a tumor xenograft disease model. Results of these in vivo studies are described below. Murine KDR (Flk-1) Lung Phosphorylation Assay. Balb/c female mice were dosed orally with compound 48 at 3, 10, and 30 mpk. Two hours after dosing with 48, 3 µg of murine VEGF was injected intravenously, and after 5 min the mice were sacrificed and the lungs were immediately dissected. Levels of phosphorylated Flk-1 were subsequently determined by Delphia assay. As shown in Figure 6, a dose dependent inhibition of Flk-1 phosphorylation was observed with significant inhibition seen at all doses tested (P < 0.0001). At the three doses examined, terminal plasma levels of compound 48 were measured to be 0.16, 0.49, and 1.5 µM. Matrigel Plug Assay. Vascular permeability was induced in female CD-1 nu/nu mice by subcutaneous implantation of a Matrigel plug containing HEK293 cells overexpressing recombinant murine VEGF. After 22 h, a single dose of compound 48 was administered orally at 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg. After an additional 6 h, an iv injection of 0.1 mL 1% Evans blue dye was administered. Vascular permeability was quantified by the amount of extravasated dye in a 1 cm2 piece of skin overlying the plug. A dose dependent inhibition of vascular permeability was observed with statistically significant effects being seen at doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg (Figure 7). At the active doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg, the plasma concentrations of 48 at t ) 6 h were 4.0 and 10.3 µM, respectively. Rat Corneal Assay. Compound 48 was also evaluated in the rat corneal angiogenesis model (Figure 8). Female Sprague­Dawley rats were implanted with a VEGF- or BSA-soaked disk into the corneal stroma. Compound 48 was administered once daily (QD) for 7 days, at which point the corneas were photographed and the number of blood vessels was measured. A dose dependent decrease in the number of blood vessels was observed with an estimated ED50 of 0.1 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic analysis determined the corresponding AUC and Cmax to be 1.3 µM · h and 0.2 µM, respectively. Tumor Xenograft Model. The antitumor activity of 48 was measured in a human colon adenocarcinoma (HT29) xenograft model in female CD-1 nu/nu mice (Figure 9). Mice bearing tumors staged at approximately the same size (300 mm3) were dosed orally with vehicle or 48 once a day for 14 days. The tumor volume was determined twice per week by caliper measurements and recorded along with body weights as an indicator of gross toxicity. Significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, and significant tumor regression was observed at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg after 7 and 10 days, respectively (Table 8). These strong pharmacological effects were observed without any significant weight loss. Conclusions Guided by the X-ray structures of two inhibitors bound to the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase, a novel series of potent inhibitors, naphthamides, were designed and evaluated. Through modification of the different units of this scaffold, we identified several potent and selective compounds. Among them, 48 demonstrated good pharmacokinetics across species and robust pharmacological activity that included in vivo inhibition of

VEGFR-2 Kinase Assay.21 In a 96-well plate, 5 nM/L of either the phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated form of the VEGFR-2 kinase domain was incubated with compound (10-point titration ranging from 3 µM to 0.15 nM), 1 µM/L gastrin substrate, 20 mM/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM/L MgCl2, 100 mM/L NaCl, 1.5 mM/L EGTA, 1 mM/L DTT, 0.2 mM/L sodium orthovanadate, and 20 µg/mL BSA for 30 min at 25 °C. ATP was added at a final concentration of 11.8 µM and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Eu-labeled antiphosphotyrosine pT66 antibody (PerkinElmer) was then used for detection. HUVEC Proliferation Assay.21 Cells were cultured in endothelial growth medium-2 (Cambrex). HUVECs were seeded into flat-bottom, 96-well plates (BD Falcon) at 3000 cells per well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin. After culture for 22 h, media were removed and cells were preincubated for 2 h with serial dilutions of compound diluted 1:400 in DMEM with 10% FBS plus penicillin/streptomycin. HUVECs were then challenged with 50 ng/mL VEGF or 20 ng/ml bFGF and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), and plates were frozen at -70 °C for 24 h. Plates were thawed, incubated with CyQuant dye (Molecular Probes), and read on a Victor 1420 workstation (PerkinElmer Corporation). IC50 data were calculated using the LevenburgMarquardt algorithm in a four-parameter logistic equation (ID Business Solutions Ltd., Alameda, CA). In Vitro Metabolism and CLint Calculations. The in vitro intrinsic clearances, CLint, of the test compounds were determined by incubations with human and rat liver microsomes purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). The 400 µL incubations contained 0.25 mg of microsomal protein/mL, 1 mM NADPH, 2 mM MgCl2 in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Test compounds were added to the prewarmed (37 °C) incubation mixtures at the final concentration of 1 µM. At 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min following addition of test compound, aliquots of the incubation mixture (35 µL) were collected into an equal volume of acetonitrile + internal standard (1 µM tolbutamide). The samples were centrifuged at

3500g for 15 min and analyzed on a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry system consisting of 2 Shimadzu LC-10AD HPLC pumps and a DGU-14A degasser (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD), CTC PAL autoinjector (Leap Technologies, Carrboro, NC) and a API3000 LC-MSMS system. Chromatography was conducted on a Sprite Armor C18 (20 mm × 2.1 mm, 10µm) analytical column (Analytical Sales and Products, Pompton Plains, NJ) with a 0.5 µm PEEK guard filter, using the following mobile phase gradient program: MPA ) H2O with 0.1% formic acid; MPB ) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid; 0 min ) 98% MPA, 2% MPB; 0.3 min ) 98% MPA, 2% MPB; 0.7 min ) 5% MPA, 95% MPB; 1.3 min ) 5% MPA, 95% MPB; 1.4 min ) 98% MPA, 2% MPB; 1.7 min ) end of run; approximately 2 min between sample injections. For each compound, peak areas at each time point were converted to the natural log of the percentage remaining relative to the 0 min samples.35 The resulting slope of these values relative to time (k) was converted to in vitro T1/2 where T1/2 ) -0.693/k. CLint was calculated using the following relationship: CLint ) (0.693/T1/2)(1/0.25 mg/mL). Murine KDR (Flk-1) Lung Phosphorylation Assay. Balb/c female mice were dosed orally with compound 48 at the indicated doses. Two hours after dosing with 48, 3 µg of murine VEGF was injected intravenously, and after 5 min the mice were sacrificed and the lungs were immediately dissected. Blood samples were collected to determine plasma drug concentrations. Levels of phosphorylated Flk-1 were subsequently determined by Delphia assay. Data represent the mean ( standard error. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni-Dunn post hoc test. In Vivo Vascular Permeability Assay. Vascular permeability was induced using a modified Miles assay36 and was conducted as previously described.21 Rat Corneal Angiogenesis Model. Corneal angiogenesis was evaluated in adult female Sprague­Dawley rats as previously described.37 Pharmacokinetic Studies. Male Sprague­Dawley rats were dosed via femoral vein (intravenous, DMSO solution, dose 1 mg/ kg) or via oral gavage (suspensions in OraPlus, pH adjusted to a range of 2.0­2.2 using methanesulfonic acid, dose 10 mg/kg). Concentrations of all formulations were selected to allow for dose volumes in accordance with the highest scientific, humane, and ethical principals as defined by IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees). Serial blood samples were collected from jugular vein into heparized tubes over a 12­24 h period. Plasma was separated by centrifugation, and the sample was prepared for analysis by protein precipitation with acetonitrile. Quantitation of the test compounds was accomplished by reverse-phase liquid chromatography with mass spectral detection in multiple reaction monitoring mode, with an appropriate internal standard. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance, volume of distribution, and terminal half-life were calculated by a noncompartmental method. Tumor Xenograft Model. The HT29 cell line was originally obtained from ATCC. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in DMEM high glucose/5% FBS, 1× NEAA, 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco/BRL, Grand Island, NY) under standard tissue culture conditions. CD1 nu/nu mice within approximately 4­8 weeks of age were challenged with subcutaneous implants of cultured HT29 human colon cancer cells (1 × 107 cells per mouse). Eleven days later when tumors had reached approximately 300 mm3, animals began continuous daily treatment with compound 48 administered po, qd at the indicated dose levels. Tumor volumes as established by caliper measurements were recorded twice per week, along with body weights as an index of toxicity. Data are expressed as mean values ( standard errors as a function of time. Statistical significance of observed differences was evaluated by repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) followed by Scheffé post hoc testing for multiple comparisons. Covalent Binding Studies. Human and rat liver microsomes (20 mg/mL) were purchased from Xenotech, LLC (Lenexa, KS). NADPH and glutathione were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). H218O was ordered from Cambridge

Isotope Laboratories Inc. (Andover, MA), and SOLVABLE was purchased from Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Microsomal Incubations. 14C compound (10 µM) and liver microsomes (1 mg/mL) were mixed with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for a final volume of 0.5 mL. The samples were preincubated at 37 °C for 3 min, and then 1 mM NADPH was added. The incubations were quenched with 1.0 mL of icecold acetonitrile after 60 min followed by vortex mixing and centrifugation. The supernatant was dried under a steady stream of N2 and reconstituted in the initial mobile phase described below. A 50 µL injection was made using the LCMS method described below. In Vitro Covalent Binding Assay. 14C compound (10 µM) was again incubated with liver microsomes (1 mg/mL), (()-glutathione (1 mM), 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and NADPH (1 mM) in a final volume of 0.2 mL. The incubations were quenched with 0.4 mL of ice-cold acetonitrile after 60 min followed by vortex mixing, centrifugation, and removal of the supernatant. The pellet was washed three times with 80% methanol, twice with 3:1 ethanol/ ether, and twice with 80% methanol. The total radioactivity in the final supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting and was not more than background. The pellet was dried overnight and then solubilized in 0.5 mL of 60% SOLVABLE. The protein concentration was determined using a standard BCA protein assay, and 0.375 mL of the solubilized protein was used for liquid scintillation counting. LCMS Assay. HPLC analyses were carried out on an Agilent 1100 gradient system (Palo Alto, CA). Separation was achieved on a Waters YMC ODS-AQ 4.6 mm × 150 mm column with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B). The gradient started at 95% A and linearly ramped to 50% A over 30 min. The flow was split so that 0.8 mL/min flowed through an INUS -RAM (Rivera Beach, FL; scintillation cocktail flow rate of 2.4 mL/min) and 0.2 mL/min flowed into a Thermo Electron ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ-Deca XP plus or LTQ; San Jose, CA). Protein Binding Assay. Plasma filtrate was used for the calibration curve and QC samples. To generate plasma filtrate, an aliquot of plasma was filtered through Millipore Centriplus (a filter) by spinning at 3000g (4980 rpm) at 4 °C for 24 h with a Beckman Avanti J-251 ultracentrifuge. An aliquot of 10 µL of test compound (1 mg/mL in DMSO) was added to 1990 µL of human, rat, dog, and mouse plasma to give a final concentration of 5 mg/mL (12.9 µM). Separate QC samples were prepared by adding 10 µL of the test compound spiked plasma sample (5 µg/mL) to 490 µL of plasma filtrate, in duplicate. The plasma samples including the QC samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Following incubation, 800 µL was transferred to the centrifuge tube (in duplicate) and spun at 120 000 rpm for 3 h at 37 °C with a TLA120.2 rotor (Optima TLX ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter). The top portion below the lipid layer of the centrifuged plasma sample was aspirated (100 µL in triplicate) for LCMS analysis. The QC samples (100 µL in duplicate) were also aspirated for LCMS analysis. The concentrations of the samples (n ) 6) and QCs (n ) 2) were determined from a linear regression of peak area ratios (analyte peak area/IS peak area) versus the theoretical concentrations of the calibration standards. The percent of binding was calculated as % protein binding ) 1 (concentration of the centrifuged plasma sample) / (mean concentration of the QC) × 100

(24) Aminobenzoxazoles exhibited potent inhibition of KDR in our enzyme assay; however, the 2-aminobenzoxazoles were considerably less potent when tested in our human umbilical vein endothelial cell assay (60-fold enzyme to cell shift). While incorporation of a basic solubilizing group afforded improved cellular potency, it also resulted in compounds with inferior pharmacokinetic properties, such as large volumes of distribution and high plasma clearance levels. (25) Pyridylpyrimidine 5 lacks selectivity and is equipotent against KDR and Tie-2. (26) (a) He, M.; Kania, R. S.; Lou, J.; Zhou, R.
