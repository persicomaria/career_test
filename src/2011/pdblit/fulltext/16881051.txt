Siyang Sun, Linda Geng, and Yousif Shamoo* Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77005

ABSTRACT In vivo, replicative DNA polymerases are made more processive by their interactions with accessory proteins at the replication fork. Single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) is an essential protein that binds tightly and cooperatively to single-stranded DNA during replication to remove adventitious secondary structures and protect the exposed DNA from endogenous nucleases. Using information from high resolution structures and biochemical data, we have engineered a functional chimeric enzyme of the bacteriophage RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB with substantially increased processivity. Fusion of RB69 DNA polymerase with its cognate SSB via a short six amino acid linker increases affinity for primer-template DNA by sixfold and subsequently increases processivity by sevenfold while maintaining fidelity. The crystal structure of this fusion protein was solved by a combination of multiwavelength anomalous diffraction and ∞ molecular replacement to 3.2 A resolution and shows that RB69 SSB is positioned proximal to the N-terminal domain of RB69 DNA polymerase near the template strand channel. The structural and biochemical data suggest that SSB interactions with DNA polymerase are transient and flexible, consistent with models of a dynamic replisome during elongation.

Key words: DNA replication; bacteriophage RB69; DNA polymerase; single-stranded DNA binding protein; processivity; crystal structure INTRODUCTION Highly processive DNA replication is achieved in vivo by replicative DNA polymerases with the help of accessory proteins. DNA replication in RB69 is similar to those of eukaryotes and archae, and it has been a prototype for studies on DNA replication and assembly of the functional replisome. Bacteriophage RB69 is closely related to T4, and thus, the large wealth of genetic and biochemical information from the well-characterized T4 system is readily applicable to the rational design of proteins and enzymes with new or enhanced functional properties. RB69 and T4 DNA polymerases (gp43) share a high degree of sequence identity (74% amino acid similarity) and are members of the pol-a family of replicative DNA polymerases.1,2 Moreover,

there are several high-resolution structures available in the T4/RB69 system, including DNA polymerase (gp43),3≠5 sliding clamp (gp45),4,6 and Single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB; gp32).7 In vitro, a combination of T4 bacteriophage SSB (gp32), sliding clamp (gp45), clamp loader (gp44/62), and DNA polymerase (gp43) are able to replicate DNA primer-template at rates approaching 500 nucleotides per second, similar to that expected in vivo.8≠10 In the absence of accessory proteins, T4 DNA polymerase has a fairly low processivity and has difficulty overcoming even weak secondary structures in the template strand.8,11 In vivo, secondary structures on the single-stranded template strand are destabilized by the SSB family of proteins.12 DNA polymerase processivity is further increased by specific protein≠protein contacts made from the C-terminus of DNA polymerase to the toroidally shaped sliding clamp protein. In bacteriophage T4/RB69, the DNA polymerase interaction with the sliding clamp is made via a short C-terminal sequence in DNA polymerase comparable to the PCNA interacting motif (PIP-Box) of eukaryotes.4,13,14 Members of the sliding clamp family of proteins are loaded onto duplex DNA by the clamp loaders in a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and ATP dependent mechanism.15≠18 In the absence of an appropriate primer-template DNA, interactions between DNA polymerase and the sliding clamp are fairly weak ($micromolar)13 and those to SSB even weaker (substantially less than micromolar).19 Weak interactions between DNA polymerase and its cognate accessory proteins preclude formation of unproductive complexes when DNA is absent. In the context of the replication fork, DNA polymerase interactions to accessory proteins become meaningful, since all the primary actors are localized to the DNA and increase the local concentra-

tion such that weak interactions can have a pronounced effect on replication processivity and fidelity. Limited proteolysis has shown that the T4/RB69 SSB can be divided into three distinct domains20≠22: the N-terminal ``B-domain'' (residues 1≠21) essential for the cooperative binding of T4/RB69 SSB to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA),23,24 the highly acidic C-terminal ``A-domain'' (residues 255≠299) that mediates interactions with other proteins involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair,25≠27 and the DNA binding ``core domain'' (residues 22≠254). The core domain has the same intrinsic affinity as the intact protein for short single-stranded DNA.28 Previously, we have characterized the interaction between RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB and have shown that DNA polymerase-core SSB interaction on primer-template DNA increases the overall affinity of RB69 SSB for DNA by about 60-fold. We have also shown that the C-terminal domain of RB69 single-stranded DNA-binding protein, previously suggested to be the site of RB69 DNA polymerase-SSB interactions, is dispensable for these interactions in vitro.19 The structures of T4 SSB and that of RB69 DNA polymerase primer-template complex have suggested that the template strand enters DNA polymerase close to the Nterminal domain (residues 1≠108 and 340≠382)5 and that a small flexible amino acid linker could still allow productive SSB-polymerase interaction. On the basis of these biochemical and structural studies, we designed a fusion protein (F6) where RB69 SSB core domain is connected to the N-terminus of RB69 DNA polymerase via a flexible six amino acid linker. We observed significant increases in polymerase processivity, suggesting that the fusion of SSB has not interfered with DNA polymerase activity. We have solved the structures of both the DNA binding domain of ∞ ∞ the RB69 SSB (2.0 A resolution) and the chimera (3.2 A resolution) and have shown that RB69 SSB is positioned proximal to the N-terminal domain of RB69 DNA polymerase near the template strand channel. The positioning of the SSB is consistent with models showing the SSB protecting the template strand as it enters DNA polymerase.3 MATERIALS AND METHODS Enzymes, M13mp18, and p(dT)36 were purchased from New England Biolabs, poly(dA) from Pharmacia, and chemicals from either Sigma or Acros. Chromatography resins were purchased from Whatman and Amersham-Pharmacia. Oligonucleotides were purchased from either IDT or MWG. Cloning and Overexpression of RB69 Single-Stranded DNA Binding Protein-DNA Polymerase Fusion (F6) The original clones encoding RB69 gene 32 (pLIA5) and RB69 gp43 exo¿ (pCWSOR) were the gifts of Dr. J. Karam (Tulane University School of Medicine). gp32 core domain (residues 22≠253) and gp43 were amplified by PCR and ligated into pET101-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The primers were designed such that after

ligation, the C-terminus of gp32 core domain (residues 21≠253) was connected to the N-terminus of gp43 through a flexible linker (Gly-Thr-Gly-Ser-Gly-Thr) from the single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) C-terminus to the DNA polymerase N-terminus. Expression and Purification of RB69 gp43 exo2, gp32 Proteins and F6 Clones for the overexpression of intact RB69 gp32 and gp32 core were generated previously.19 RB69 DNA polymerase exo¿, intact RB69 gp32, gp32 core domain were purified as described earlier.19 F6 protein was induced by 1 mM IPTG overnight and purified as follows. Cells were lysed and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was loaded onto a 60-mL P11 column, washed with buffer containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and eluted with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl. Fractions containing F6 were then dialyzed to 150 mM NaCl overnight and purified further using ion exchange chromatography (MonoQ). F6 was eluted with a linear salt gradient of 150 mM NaCl to 1M NaCl with 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5. F6 was concentrated to 20 mg/mL, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 mM DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. Average yield for F6 is about 2 mg/L growth. SeMet F6 was generated by methionine pathway inhibition29 and was purified in a similar manner as the native F6. DNA Polymerase Processivity Assays Polymerase processivity assays were carried out using two different sets of primers: P1 (50 -CCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAA-30 ) or P2 (50 -GCGGGGAGAGGCGGTTTGCG-30 ) annealed to M13mp18. Primers were 50 end labeled with 32P and purified on a NICK column (Pharmacia). Each reaction mixture (4 lL total volume) contained 1.8 nM annealed primer-template, 250 lM dNTPs, 25 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, 200 lg/mL BSA, and 1 mM EDTA. Reaction mixtures were incubated with 1.8 nM protein or combinations of proteins at 308C for 2 min and the reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 6 mM. Single turnover reaction conditions were achieved by the addition of heparin to a final concentration of 500 lg/mL together with MgCl2 in the initiation buffer. The presence of a high concentration of heparin ensured that once DNA polymerase dissociates, it binds to heparin instead of reassociating with the primer-template junction.30 Reactions were stopped at different time points by addition of 6 lL loading buffer containing 83% (v/v) formamide, 0.01% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue and 33 mM EDTA. Products were boiled for 5 min and fractionated on 6% polyacrylamide7M urea gels. The intensity of the products was analyzed by phosphorimaging,30 and processivity was calculated by the method of Von Hippel et al.8 The product intensities were plotted as log (nI/nT) versus n ¿ 1, where n is the number of nucleotides incorporated at

The data was fitted with IgorPro (Wavemetrics, CA) to the following equation: log (nI/nT) º (n ¿ 1)log PI ˛ log (1 ¿ PI), where PI is defined as the ``microscopic processivity parameter'' for position I, the probability of not terminating at position I. The average primer extension length was determined from 1/(1 ¿ PI). In Vitro Fidelity Assays In vitro fidelity assays were carried out on the 50 end 32 P labeled primer P2 annealed to template T2 (50 TTTTTTTTACACGCAAACCGCCTCTCCCCGC-30 ). Each reaction mixture contained 0.5 lM RB69 DNA polymerase or F6, 3.3 nM annealed primer-template, 250 lM dTTP, 25 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl, 10 mM DTT, 200 lg/mL BSA, and 1 mM EDTA. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 6 mM and stopped at different time points by the addition of loading buffer containing 83% (v/v) formamide, 0.01% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 33 mM EDTA. The products were analyzed by separation on a 20% polyacrylamide-7M urea gel, followed by phosphorimaging. Nitrocellulose Filter Binding Assays Binding affinities of RB69 DNA polymerase and F6 to a primer-template DNA were measured by nitrocellulose filter binding assays. Concentration of annealed 50 end 32 P labeled P2/T2 was set at least tenfold below the Kd and protein concentration was varied. Labeled DNA and protein were incubated in a total volume of 230 lL assay buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% (v/v) DMSO, 0.3 mM DTT, and 0.1 mg/mL BSA for 30 min before filtering though nitrocellulose filter paper. Protein-bound radiolabeled DNA was detected and quantified using a Fuji phosphorimager. Data (Y) were analyzed with IgorPro (Wavemetrics, CA) to estimate values for the variables in the following equation:

onal rod shaped crystals grew within 3 days. RB69 SSB ∞ core domain crystals diffracted to 2.0 A, using home source X-ray. Data were collected on an RAXIS4˛˛ detector and processed with Crystal Clear and d*trek31 (Table I). There are two copies of RB69 SSB core in each asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by molecular replacement in CNS, using T4 SSB core structure (1GPC) as a search model (90% identical). The structure was manually rebuilt in O, refined in CNS and deposited (PDB 2A1K). F6 Crystallization Native F6 crystals were grown by vapor diffusion in hanging drops at 208C. F6 (1.5 lL) was mixed with 1.5 lL well solution containing 16≠18% PEG400, 0.1M Tris-Cl, pH 8.0. Hexagonal rod shaped crystals grew within 2 days. Diffraction quality SeMet F6 crystals required 3% (v/v) 6aminocaproic acid as an additive in the growing condition. F6 Data Collection and Processing and Structure Refinement Native and SeMet F6 crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant (35% PEG400, 0.1M Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) by gradually increasing PEG400 concentration and were flash frozen. Both selenomethione and native crystals ∞ diffracted to 3.2 A, and data were collected at APS SBC 19ID beamline (Table I). Crystals were cryocooled at 100 K for data collection. Data were processed with HKL2000.32 The F6 structure was solved by a combination of Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) and molecular replacement. Twenty five out of 30 SeMet peaks were located using program SHELXD33 and positions were refined in SHARP.34 Phases were calculated ∞ to 4 A and underwent density modification in SHARP. Experimental phases were then used for phased translation in CNS, using the RB69 DNA polymerase structure (1IH7). Attempts to locate the position of SSB core by phased translation in CNS and CCP4 were not successful, and therefore, SSB core was positioned manually into experimentally phased maps. Positioning of SSB was confirmed by anomalous peaks arising from two SeMet residues and electron density for the Zn2˛ of the zinc binding site of SSB that was not included in the original model. The structure was manually rebuilt in O, refined in CNS, and deposited (PDB 2ATQ). RESULTS F6 Displayed Higher Processivity Than RB69 DNA Polymerase To insure that fusion of the RB69 SSB core domain to RB69 DNA polymerase did not inhibit processivity, we compared the activity of RB69 DNA polymerase and F6 on M13mp18 DNA primed with two different 20-mers (P1 and P2) (Fig. 1). DNA synthesis using M13mp18 as template DNA is frequently paused or arrested at sites throughout the sequence.30 When DNA polymerase dissociates from the primer≠template junction, it can reassociate and resume DNA replication.

Fig. 1. F6 displays higher processivity than does RB69 DNA polymerase. Primers were 50 end labeled 32P 20-mers and are complementary to different regions on M13mp18. Proteins were incubated for 2 min at 308C with annealed primer-template DNA and dNTPs. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2 and stopped by the addition of EDTA/formamide loading buffer. Some of the reactions also have 500 lg/mL heparin to produce single turn-over kinetics. Reaction products are separated on a 6% polyacrylamide-7M urea gel. Lane 1: Reaction mixture without enzyme.

processivity of F6 to RB69 DNA polymerase, a heparin trap was used to capture single-turnover events. Proteins were incubated with primer-template DNA and dNTPs in the absence of MgCl2, and synthesis was then initiated by addition of MgCl2 or heparin plus MgCl2. The reactions were stopped at different time points by addition of EDTA. F6 displayed a much higher processivity than did RB69 DNA polymerase (compare lanes 3 and 6 in Fig. 1). F6 can overcome more arrest sites than does RB69 DNA polymerase and yield products of a much longer size (Fig. 2). The synthesis of larger DNA products is the result of higher processivity, as shown by comparing the results of single versus multiturnover reactions. The amount and length of products produced under multiturnover conditions are comparable (lanes 5, 8 in Fig. 1), whereas single turnover conditions produce striking changes in both length and quantity (lanes 3, 6 in Fig. 1). Mixtures of RB69 DNA polymerase and different SSB constructs were also tested, and these showed that F6 is more processive under single turnover conditions. Reactions with heparin were also conducted for longer times and, as expected, showed no significant differences from 1 min reaction times (data not shown). There was a sevenfold increase in processivity for F6 compared with RB69 DNA polymerase, as determined by the increase of average primer extension length (Table II). The ability of F6 to overcome arrest sites are shown in the reactions using P2 as primer. P2 anneals to a region on M13mp18 105 nt downstream from a major replication pause site (12 bp hairpin structure). As shown in

Fig. 2. Comparison of products from F6 and RB69 DNA determined by polymerase processivity assays. Product intensity from F6 and RB69 DNA polymerase processivity assays was measured using P1/ M13mp18 as primer-template DNA and was analyzed by phosphorimaging. The product intensities were plotted as log (nI/nT) versus n ¿ 1, where n is the number of nucleotides incorporated at position I, nI is the intensity of extended primers that terminate at position I and nT is the sum of the intensities of extended primers that terminate at and before position I. The data was fitted with IgorPro (Wavemetrics, CA) to the following equation: log (nI/nT) º (n ¿ 1)log PI ˛ log (1 ¿ PI), where PI is defined as the ``microscopic processivity parameter'' for position I, the probability of not terminating at position I. The average primer extension length was determined from 1/(1 ¿ PI).8

Fig. 3. In vitro fidelity assay shows that F6 has comparable fidelity to RB69 DNA polymerase. 0.5 lM RB69 DNA polymerase or F6 was added to reaction mixture containing 3.3 nM primer/template and 250 lM dTTP. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2 and stopped by adding EDTA/formamide at time points 0, 7, 15, 60 and 300 s. Reaction products are separated on a 20% polyacrylamide-7M urea gel. Misincorporation events were qualitatively observed by the addition of dTTP at the N ˛ 2 position, the product of which was immediately extended to N ˛ 3 product.

primer strand to give the N ˛ 1 product. The second unpaired base in the template is C. Since dTTP is highly in excess, rare misincorporation events can be qualitatively observed by the incorporation of dTTP at the N ˛ 2 position. Since the third unpaired base in the template is A, N ˛ 2 product was immediately extended to N ˛ 3 product. Both RB69 DNA polymerase and F6 have comparable levels of fidelity, based on this qualitative result.

F6 Has Higher Affinity for Primer-Template DNA Nitrocellulose filter binding assays have been carried out to compare the binding affinities of F6 and RB69 DNA polymerase to a primer-template DNA. As shown in Figure 4, F6 binds to primer-template DNA sixfold tighter than does RB69 DNA polymerase (Table III). These results are in good agreement with our earlier studies on the affinity of RB69 DNA polymerase for primer-template DNA at this pH and ionic strength.19

lane 3, F6 is more efficient in overcoming this major pause site and continue DNA synthesis, while DNA polymerase and mixtures of DNA polymerase and SSB and core SSB do not (lanes 6, 9, 12, 15 in Fig. 1). Similarly, without heparin present, F6 still displayed higher processivity than RB69 DNA polymerase for short reaction times but the effect was much less distinguishable for longer reaction times due to the reinitiation of DNA synthesis through multiple binding events. In Vitro Fidelity Assays Shows F6 Has Comparable Fidelity to RB69 DNA Polymerase Fidelity is as important an attribute as processivity in DNA replication. The addition of the RB69 SSB ssDNA binding domain could have altered DNA polymerase interactions to the template strand in an unforeseen manner and could have resulted in altered fidelity. To investigate the fidelity of F6, dNTP misincorporation into primer-templates was measured using a template of sufficient length to allow the binding of both the polymerase and SSB.35 32P labeled primer-template was incubated with an excessive amount of DNA polymerase or F6 and only dTTP (Fig. 3). The first unpaired base in the template is A and one T was rapidly added to the

F6 Structure Determination The structure of RB69 SSB core was solved by molecular ∞ replacement to 2.0 A and was then used in the F6 structure determination. The structure of F6 was determined to ∞ 3.2 A resolution, using a combination of MAD and molecular replacement (Fig. 5). Initial attempts to solve the structure solely by molecular replacement were unsatisfactory. Although DNA polymerase could be located by molecular replacement, little electron density was observed for SSB in Fo≠Fc maps. Phases determined by MAD were able to produce substantially better electron density for both RB69 SSB and DNA polymerase. Final refinement was done in a native data set. The final structure has an Rfree º 32.3% and Rworking º 27.5%. SSB has a much higher average B factor than DNA polymerase (Fig. 5). The linker and C-terminal 12 residues of SSB are highly flexible and were not observed in electron density maps.

DISCUSSION DNA replication is a complex and dynamic process that requires well-regulated and appropriate interactions between replisomal proteins. In vivo, the specificity and strength of replisomal protein interactions is optimized to produce highly accurate and processive DNA synthesis. DNA polymerase is recruited to the replication bubble by its nanomolar affinity for the primer≠template junction. SSB cooperatively binds to available ssDNA as well as the template strand with nearly nanomolar affinity.21 The sliding clamp is loaded onto the dsDNA region of the primer≠template junction by clamp loader proteins by means of ATP hydrolysis. Once the replisomal proteins are recruited to the replication bubble, the high local concentration of these proteins bound to DNA facilitates replisome assembly. Many of the interactions between the replisomal proteins are quite modest in strength or require loading proteins, which prevents replisome assembly out of the context of

DNA replication but limits their utility in biotechnology applications such as improving the efficiency of PCR. An example of moderate interactions can be found in the interaction of replicative DNA polymerase with the sliding clamp family of proteins. In these interactions, DNA polymerase processivity is increased by a typically micromolar interaction to the sliding clamp that is topologically trapped onto the dsDNA of the primer/template junction. In comparison to the sliding clamp, the interactions between DNA polymerase and SSB are even weaker. During DNA replication, the SSB must either be displaced from the template strand or be pushed ``ahead'' of the DNA polymerase in a treadmill like mechanism. The relatively weak interactions between DNA polymerase and SSB make this type of dynamic process possible. Purified RB69 SSB and DNA polymerase do not form stable complexes in solution (data not shown), although in the presence of DNA, T4 SSB, and DNA polymerase associate with each other.10,37 Previously, we have used fluorescence studies to measure the interaction between RB69 SSB and DNA polymerase in the presence of a primer≠template junction and observed a 60-fold increase in binding of SSB to ssDNA,19 which corresponds to less than 3 Kcal/mol free energy, suggesting the interactions between the two proteins may even be weaker than 1 mM. In the absence of DNA substrate, the interaction between RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB is weak and transient. In the presence of DNA substrate, this interaction is strengthened by the effective local concentration and processivity is increased. Presumably, the weak interaction between DNA polymerase and SSB also prevents the formation of unproductive replisome complexes, in the absence of primer-template DNA. We have previously established that the C-terminal domain of RB69 SSB is dispensable to the interaction between RB69 SSB and DNA polymerase.19 By fusing the RB69 SSB core domain to DNA polymerase through a flexible linker, we prevent separation of the two proteins due to weak association and thus our fusion protein displays higher processivity than mixtures of RB69 SSB core and DNA polymerase alone. Presumably, the increased affinity of the fusion protein for primer-template DNA is largely responsible for the increased processivity. In vitro extension assays with DNA polymerase and a tenfold excess of intact SSB did not show increases in processivity. Because of the weak interactions between SSB and DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase may not be able to recruit the limited amount of SSB to the primer≠template junction. Our data suggest that single stranded template may need to be fully covered by SSB to provide increased processivity. Given enough SSB, DNA polymerase should display comparable processivity to our fusion protein. The fusion protein also demonstrated an enhanced ability to move through DNA secondary structures (Fig. 1). The SSB family of proteins can destabilize secondary structures by binding preferentially to ssDNA to shift the equilibrium away from the adventitious structures. In the case of the fusion protein, the higher affinity for the primer-template DNA suggests that the fusion is

less likely to dissociate and may have more opportunity to move through transient secondary structures as they breathe and the SSB can bind the available ssDNA. Our structure of the fusion protein F6 serves as a ``snapshot'' of the various conformations RB69 DNA polymerase and SSB can adopt. The C-terminal 12 amino acids of the T4/RB69 SSB core domain are mostly flexible amino acids (eight Ala and three Gly), and there is no electron density for these residues in both the T4/RB69 SSB core structures.7 Together with the six amino acids from the linker, SSB is not restrained to the N-terminal region of the polymerase. Nevertheless, the SSB is located close to the N-terminus of the polymerase, where template strand is proposed to enter the DNA polymerase.5 The absence of DNA within the F6 structure makes us hesitant to assert that our structure represents the only relevant positioning of SSB relative to DNA polymerase. The DNA polymerase in our F6 structure most closely resembles the apo polymer∞ ase structure (1WAJ & 1IH7)3,5 and has an rmsd of 0.5 A for the palm domain (residues 383≠468 and 573≠729), where the polymerase active site is located. When the two structures are aligned by the palm domain, most of the structural changes are observed in the fingers domain and thumb domain, which were shown to undergo conformational changes upon binding to DNA substrates.4,5 Although SSB is near the N-terminal template entry channel of DNA polymerase, crystal packing forces could easily play an important role in positioning SSB. This is especially true given the evidence for a weak and highly flexible interaction between DNA polymerase and SSB. SSB has weaker density and much higher average B factors than DNA polymerase in the crystal structure, suggesting SSB is more mobile than the DNA polymerase. This is consistent with a replisome that allows highly flexible articulation between DNA polymerase and its cognate accessory proteins. High processivity DNA polymerases have important applications, for example, better enzymes for PCR. To date, increases in processivity have been achieved by taking advantage of the interaction between sliding clamp and DNA polymerase. By fusing a dsDNA binding protein to the C-terminus of DNA polymerase, the processivity of DNA polymerases has been enhanced by 5- to 17-fold.38≠40 Using the available high resolution structures of bacteriophage, T4/RB69 replication proteins allowed us to take rational approach to protein engineering in which we have fused the C-terminus of RB69 SSB core domain to the Nterminus of RB69 DNA polymerase and observed a sevenfold increase in processivity. We have shown that our fusion protein has higher affinity to the primer≠template junction than RB69 DNA polymerase, contributing to higher processivity together that produces longer extension products and a greater ability to move through secondary structures. Potentially, a three-protein fusion with SSB fused to the N-terminus and a dsDNA binding protein to the C-terminus of DNA polymerase will have additive increases in processivity and may be useful for applications in biotechnology.
