Abstract Large conductance, Ca2þ -sensitive potassium (BK) channels are critical components of the O2 signalling cascade in a number of cells, including the carotid body and central neurones. Although the nature of the BK channel O2 sensor is still unknown, evidence suggests redox modulators might form part of the O2 sensing channel complex. By metabolising glutathione, c-glutamyl transpeptidase (cGT) could act as such an O2 sensor. Western blotting and immunocytochemistry revealed high cGT expression in HEK293 cells expressing the a- and b-subunits of human recombinant BK and cGT co-immunoprecipitated with BKa. Acivicin blockade of cGT reversibly inhibited BK channels, suggesting that this BKa protein partner contributes to tonic channel activity. However, knock-out of cGT using siRNA had no effect on hypoxic BK channel inhibition. Together, these data indicate that cGT is a BKa protein partner, that its activity regulates BK channels but that it is not the BK O2 sensor. Ó 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Large conductance, Ca2þ -sensitive potassium (BK) channels are key initiators of the O2 -dependent cascade which links decreased O2 availability to increased excitability in a number of cellular systems, including the carotid body glomus cell [1,2] and components of the central nervous system [3,4]. Although both native and recombinant BK channels are acutely and reversibly inhibited as O2 supply becomes compromised [2­6] and, in the carotid body at least, the resulting cell depolarisation and voltage-gated Ca2þ influx induce hypoxiadependent transmitter release [7], the molecular nature of the O2 sensor in the arterial chemoreceptor is still unknown. Since regulation by O2 of both native [2,4] and recombinant [6] BK channels is retained in channel recordings from whole-cell and excised, inside-out configurations of the patch clamp technique, it has been suggested by us and others that the O2 sensor (and any

potential substrates/reaction products) must be closely associated with the channel protein itself [4,6,7]. Quite recently, there have been reports that the membrane-bound ectoenzyme, c-glutamyl transpeptidase (cGT), is intimately involved in O2 sensing in the nucleus tractus solitarius [8] and some investigators in the field have speculated that this enzyme may act as an O2 sensor in other cell types. Indeed, it is an attractive proposition that cGT, being so closely involved in setting cellular redox potential via glutathione metabolism and subsequent production of reactive O2 species, might endow BK channels with their O2 sensitivity. To investigate this supposition, we have taken advantage of the easily amenable and well-established cellular model of BK channel acute O2 sensing; HEK 293 cells stably expressing both the a- and b-subunits of the human BK channel [6,9,10]. Using this model we have employed a sequential approach of immunoprecipitation, immunocytochemistry, and Western blotting to establish cGT expression levels and protein localisation.

Enhanced chemoluminescent (ECL) detection of bound second layer antibody was carried out by mixing equal volumes of ECL Western blotting detection reagents 1 and 2 (Amersham­Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). The mixtures were added to the blots, which were then incubated for 1 min, wrapped in cling film, and then exposed to high performance chemoluminescent film from Amersham­Pharmacia. Production of siRNA and lipofection of HEK 293 cells. Two short interfering (si)RNAs were designed to target bases 582­603 (cGT siRNA1) and 722­743 (cGT siRNA2) of the cGT coding sequence (Accession NM_013430). Using the siRNA Template Design Tool for the Silencer siRNA Construction Kit (Ambion), the following oligonucleotide templates were designed: cGT siRNA1, antisense 50 - AACCTGACAACCATGTGTACAC CCTGTCTC -30 ; cGT siRNA1, sense 50 - AAGTGTACACATGGTTGTCAGG CCTGTCTC -30 . cGT siRNA2, antisense 50 - AATGCCCACAGCATGGGCATCG CCTGTCTC -30 ; cGT siRNA2, sense 50 - AACGATGCCCATGCTGTGGGCA CCTGTCTC -30 . Underlined bases correspond to cGT sequences. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma Genosys (Poole, Dorset, UK) and diluted to 100 lM in nuclease-free water. Twenty microlitres aliquots were stored at )20 °C until use. The control siRNA (scrambled GAPDH sequence) was purchased from Ambion. Template preparation, dsRNA synthesis, siRNA preparation, and purification were all carried out using the Silencer siRNA Labelling Kit--Cy3 according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNAs were dissolved in nuclease-free H2 O and diluted 1:25 in TE buffer (10 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8, and 1 mM EDTA) for quantification at A260 . About 1.6 nmol duplex siRNA was taken for each Cy3-labelling reaction, which was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day before transfection with Cy3-labelled siRNA, BK-expressing HEK293 cells were plated onto 22 Â 22 mm coverslips in 6well plates containing 2 ml of medium to ensure 30­50% confluence ($1 Â 105 cells/well) at the time of transfection. In short, 10 pmol duplex, labelled siRNA was diluted into 194 ll OP T I -MEM (GibcoBRL), and 6 ll siPORT Amine (Ambion). The mixture was vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then 800 ll of normal growth medium was added before the entire mixture was added to cells (which had previously had their medium removed). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air for 4 h before 3 ml of growth medium was added and the cells were cultured for a further 48 h. Immunocytochemistry. Medium was removed from cells grown on coverslips and the cells were washed 2 times in 3 ml PBS. PBS was removed and cells were fixed with 3 ml of 10% v/v formalin (Sigma­ Aldrich) at 37 °C for 5 min and the solution was discarded. About three milliliters of 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS was added to permeabilise the cells at room temperature for 15 min and the solution was removed. Cells were refixed in 3 ml of 10% formalin solution for 5 min at room temperature. The solution was removed and the cells were washed 3 times with 3 ml PBS. Cells were incubated in 3 ml PBS (containing 5% donkey serum and 1 mM NaN3 ) at room temperature for 3 h. Thirty microlitres of cGT primary antibody was added to the medium and cells were incubated overnight at room temperature. The antibody solution was removed and cells were washed 8 times in 3 ml PBS. The FITC-labelled second layer antibody, diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 5% serum, was added and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. After removing the solution, the cells on coverslips were washed 8 times with 3 ml PBS. The coverslips were mounted with Vectashield onto slides and sealed with nail varnish. The cells were then visualised by confocal microscopy. Patch-clamp recording. Cells were grown for 24 h on glass coverslips before being transferred to a continuously perfused (5 ml/min) recording chamber (volume ca., 200 ll) mounted on the stage of an

Materials and methods
Materials Unless otherwise stated, tissue culture reagents were purchased from Gibco-BRL, (Paisley, Strathclyde, UK), molecular biological reagents were purchased from Ambion (Austin, Texas, USA), and electrophysiological reagents were purchased from Sigma­Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, UK). Methods Cell culture. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells expressing human a- and b-subunits of BK channels [6,10] were donated by Prof. M.L.J. Ashford (University of Dundee, UK). The cells were maintained in Earle's minimal essential medium (containing L -glutamine) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% antibiotic­antimycotic, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 0.2% gentamicin in a humidified incubator gassed with 5% CO2 /95% air. Cells were passaged every 7 days in a ratio of 1:24 using Ca2þ - and Mg2þ -free phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). The co-expressed a- and b-subunits were KCNMA1 (GenBank Accession No. U11717) and KCNMB1 (GenBank Accession No. U42600), respectively. Membrane preparation and immunoprecipitation. Approximately 108 HEK293 cells were pelletted at 1000g and then homogenised in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2 containing 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 50 lg/ml aprotinin). Following centrifugation at 1000g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were re-centrifuged at 16,000g for 30 min at 4 °C and the pellets solubilised in 500 ll ice-cold buffer B (5 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 1.5% v/v Triton X-100 containing 1 mM PMSF, and 50 lg/ml aprotinin). Five micrograms of BKa antibody was added (4 °C for 1 h) before the addition of 50 ll Protein G beads (4 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation). The beads were then pelleted at 7000g for 5 min and washed 3 times in 1 ml ice-cold buffer C (5 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mM NaCl, 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 containing 1 mM PMSF, and 50 lg/ml aprotinin). Electrophoresis and protein visualisation. For SDS­PAGE, pelleted immunoprecipitates (or cell lysates) were suspended in 50 ll sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris­HCl, pH 6.8, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.2% w/v SDS, 5% v/v b-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% w/v bromophenol blue), heated to 100 °C for 3 min and loaded onto SDS­polyacrylamide gels comprising 4% stacking and 10% resolving gels (4 or 10% of 37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide in 125 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.8, and 0.1% w/v SDS). Prestained molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK) were loaded next to the sample lanes. Electrophoresis was continued at 200 V until the 25 kDa marker had reached the bottom of the resolving gel. Gels were destained 3 times for 15 min in deionised H2 O. Western blotting. Prior to transfer, filter papers, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, and SDS­polyacrylamide gels were equilibrated in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 0.0375% w/v SDS, and 20% v/v methanol). Electrophoretic transfer was undertaken using a Bio-Rad wet-transfer apparatus at 20 V overnight. After blotting, membranes were blocked in 5% w/v skimmed milk in PBS for 30­60 min at room temperature and transferred to anti-cGT antibody diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer. Blots were incubated at room temperature overnight at 4 °C. The blots were then washed 3 times with PBS, 0.05% v/v Tween 20, and then once in PBS before being incubated with the second layer antibody diluted 1:1000 in 5% w/v skimmed milk

For whole-cell patch clamp recordings, the standard pipette solution was composed of (in mM): 10 NaCl, 117 KCl, 2 MgCl2 , and 11 Hepes pH 7.2, with Ca2þ buffered to 300 nM using EGTA, and CaCl2 in appropriate ratios. When filled with this solution, pipettes were of resistance 4­6 MX. The Naþ -rich bath solution was composed of (in mM): 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2 , 5 Hepes, 2.5 CaCl2 , and 10 D -glucose, and pH 7.4. Hypoxic solutions were bubbled with N2ðgÞ for at least 30 min prior to perfusion of cells, which produced no shift in pH. pO2 was measured (at the cell) using a polarised carbon fibre electrode [11] and was found to be between 30 and 40 mm Hg. Normoxic solutions were equilibrated with room air. All Kþ currents were recorded at a bath temperature of 22 Æ 0.5 °C. Current recordings were made using an Axopatch 200 A amplifier and Digidata 1320 A/D interface (Axon Instruments, Forster City, California, USA). To evoke BK currents, a standard ramp protocol was employed: )70 mV holding potential, voltage ramped from )100 to +60 mV (2000 ms, 0.1 Hz. Wild type HEK293 cells do not express BK channel currents (see Fig. 1D and [6,9]). Data analysis was performed using the PClamp 8.0 suite of software (Axon Instruments). For the time-courses and mean current­density plots, the current during the final 5 ms of the ramp was employed (i.e., at +60 mV). Current density was calculated by dividing currents by the whole cell capacitance. Statistical comparisons were made using paired Student's t tests.

Results and discussion HEK293 cells have been shown to express cGT enzyme activity [12]. Here, we extend that observation by employing Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1). Western blotting with an antibody raised against the human homologue of cGT revealed positive immunoreactive bands of the correct relative molecular mass in both wild type and BK expressing HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1A). Consistent with a previous report demonstrating both N- and O-linked glycosylation of the membrane-bound protein [13], cGT often appears in Western blot as a doublet. To probe the possible protein­protein interaction of cGT with the a-subunit of BK channel (BKa), immunoprecipitation of membrane proteins from wild type and BK-expressing HEK 293 cells was performed using a BKa-specific antibody. Subsequent Western blotting for cGT revealed a band of the appropriate mass only in BK-expressing cells, suggesting strongly that cGT and BKa are membrane protein partners (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, Western blot of BKa-immunoprecipitated membrane proteins resulted in a single band, as opposed to the usual doublet observed by Western blot of cell lysates, suggesting that BKa associates only with the mature, glycosylated protein. Confocal microscopy of BK-expressing HEK 293 cells demonstrated robust cGT immunoreactivity, localised at the plasma membrane and throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). This observation was paralleled in wild type cells (data not shown). Although functional cGT is a plasma membrane bound ectoenzyme, there is good evidence that cells which express similarly high cGT levels (often following stimulation) demonstrate significant cytoplasmic immunoreactivity (e.g., [14]). In

many tissues, cGT activity is normally low but is inducible by numerous factors, including oxidative stress [14,15]. However, in HEK 293 cells, constitutive cGT activity is high [12]--an observation fully supported by the Western blot and immunocytochemical evidence presented here--and suggests that HEK 293 cells represent an excellent model in which to study the role of cGT in regulation of recombinant proteins. Both native and recombinant BK currents are sensitive to acute changes in partial pressure of oxygen (pO2 ). Thus, during hypoxia, BK activity of carotid body [1,2], central neurones [3,4], and BK expressing HEK 293 cells [6] is suppressed. cGT is crucial to glutathione metabolism and adaptation to oxidative stress, suggesting that it plays a key role in modulating the redox potential of the cell. Since many studies of O2 -sensitive ion channels in general, and BK channels in particular, have implicated redox couples in channel regulation (e.g., [16]), we postulated that activity and O2 sensitivity of BK channels may be modulated by cGT. Such a suggestion seemed particularly exciting in light of the evidence in Fig. 1 which shows that BKa and cGT are protein partners in the plasma membrane. Wild type HEK 293 cells expressed very little current and this current was not regulated by hypoxia (Fig. 1D). In agreement with our previous single channel studies [6], whole cell currents recorded from HEK 293 cells stably expressing both the a- and b-subunits of the human BK channel were inhibited when the bath perfusate pO2 was reduced from 150 to between 30 and 40 mm Hg. This inhibition was dependent upon [Ca2þ ]i and hypoxia was maximally effective when [Ca2þ ]i was 300 nM (data not shown). Thus, within 60 s of bath hypoxia, mean BK current density was reduced significantly from 138 Æ 25 to 91 Æ 23 pA/pF (n ¼ 4, P < 0:05). Re-oxygenation rapidly reversed the inhibitory effect of hypoxia such that mean current density returned to 121 Æ 23 pA/pA, a value not significantly different from control (Fig. 1E). In order to investigate a potential role for cGT in the regulation of BK channel activity by hypoxia, we employed siRNA as a strategy by which to knock down cGT expression in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the a- and b-BK subunits. In order to assess transfection efficiency, siRNA species were labelled with Cy3. The punctate, red fluorescence seen in Figs. 2A and B demonstrates that the use of siPort Amine as a transfection vehicle is extremely efficient as a means of delivering siRNA into HEK 293 cells. Forty-eight hours following transfection with the siRNA, Cy3-labelling was observed in the majority of cells. Transfection with the control siRNA (scrambled GAPDH siRNA) altered neither the pattern nor the degree of cGT immunofluorescence (Fig. 2A). In stark contrast, lipofection with cGT siRNA (cGT siRNA 1 and cGT siRNA 2) resulted in almost complete suppression of cGT immunofluorescence (Fig. 2B), indicating that this procedure

produced HEK 293 cells in which cGT expression was essentially knocked out. Employing a fluorescence microscope in the patchclamp experiments, cells which were successfully transfected with Cy3-labelled siRNA could be positively identified. Single cells, which appeared red upon excitation at 453 nm, were patch-clamped using standard intracellular (300 nM [Ca2þ ]i ) and extracellular solutions. Cells treated with scrambled GAPDH siRNA demonstrated robust inhibition when the bath solution was made hypoxic (Fig. 2C). Thus, mean, whole cell BK current density was significantly and reversibly reduced from 183 Æ 25 to 151 Æ 25 pA/pF (Fig. 2E; n ¼ 5, P < 0:05). Importantly, treatment with cGT siRNA (which evokes complete knock-out of cGT protein) did not affect the hypoxic response (Fig. 2D). Mean current

density was, again, reversibly and significantly reduced by hypoxia from 154 Æ 30 to 117 Æ 25 pA/pF (Fig. 2F; n ¼ 5, P < 0:05). This 24% inhibition was not different from that observed in untreated cells (Fig. 1E) or cells treated with control siRNA (Fig. 2E). Although cGT is clearly not involved in O2 -sensitivity of BK channels, the fact still remains that it is a closely associated protein. Such association would normally infer functional interaction and in order to address such

cGT are of central importance in regulating whole-body responses to hypoxia, the cellular mechanisms underlying such observations are unknown. Since the hypoxic response of the carotid body and brain stem are likely linked to inhibition of Kþ channels coupled to the fact that BK channels are inhibited by acute hypoxia, it seemed reasonable to suggest that cGT might be involved in the BK channel modulation and the O2 sensing process. Our immunoprecipitation data initially indicated this might be the case (Fig. 1B) since there is significant protein­protein interaction between BKa and cGT. Indeed, the use of a selective, non-competitive blocker of cGT activity, acivicin, showed very clearly that blockade of cGT resulted in BK channel inhibition of a comparable magnitude, and with a similar time course of action, to that observed with hypoxia (compare Figs. 2C and 3B). However, although cGT is involved in modulation of BK channels in normoxia, the siRNA data shown in Fig. 2 show clearly, and for the first time, that cGT is not involved in the inhibition of BK channels by hypoxia. In conclusion, although cGT is a BK a-subunit protein partner whose turnover modulates BK channel activity, it is not involved in the signal transduction cascade which leads to BK channel inhibition during acute episodes of hypoxia.

a proposal, we employed acivicin as a selective blocker of cGT activity. Addition of 1 mM acivicin to BK-expressing HEK 293 cells resulted in a significant and reversible reduction in mean current density from 105 Æ 22 to 74 Æ 23 pA/pF (Fig. 3; n ¼ 5, P < 0:01). Thus, cGT activity is responsible for a degree of tonic BK channel activity when expressed in this recombinant system. The mechanism of such regulatory prowess is difficult to assess but redox activation by cGT-dependent production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide seems consistent with observations made by other investigators of BK channel regulation (e.g., [16]). In addition to catalysis of glutathione, cGT has also been shown to break down related compounds with a c-glutamyl moiety, including low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols, such as nitrosoglutathione [17]. These compounds are released from haemoglobin in deoxygenated blood and when injected in the nucleus tractus solitarius of the rat brain, cause a reflex increase in ventilation rate [8]. This response was similar in magnitude to the ventilatory response of rats subjected to hypoxia. Furthermore, the normal hypoxic ventilatory response was much attenuated in cGT knock-out mice. However, although it is clear that S-nitrosothiols and
