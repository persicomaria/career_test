Abstract CtBP corepressor proteins potentiate the activity of many metazoan transcriptional repressors. These proteins are homologous to prokaryotic D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases, possessing an NAD/NADH binding fold and conserved active site residues. When expressed in Drosophila, a catalytic site mutant retains biological activity, however, we find that an NAD binding mutant lacks biological activity. The NAD mutant, similar to a dimerization mutant, is expressed at low levels, indicating that binding of NAD/NADH may affect CtBP stability. These data support the idea that the ancestral dehydrogenase activity is not required for CtBP function, and NAD binding may play a regulatory, rather than catalytic, role. ” 2007 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction The C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) corepressor was identified as a modulator of E1A viral oncoprotein activity and as a mediator of transcriptional repression in Drosophila and vertebrate cells [1≠3]. CtBP binds to transcription factors via its N terminus, which interacts with PXDLS motifs in target proteins, allowing its recruitment to promoters [4,5]. The protein also interacts with histone deacetylases, methyl transferases, and demethylases, suggesting that a complex of chromatin remodeling agents mediates its repressive activity [6]. Structurally, CtBPs bear striking resemblances to D-2hydroxyacid dehydrogenases, including an NAD(H) binding Rossman fold and a putative active site that contains conserved histidine, glutamate, and arginine residues [7]. Vertebrate CtBP1 and CtBP2 proteins contain a less-well conserved domain at the C-terminus that is a target of phos-

phorylation and SUMOylation; this domain is suggested to be unstructured [8]. The single CtBP gene in Drosophila encodes two isoforms: CtBPL, which contains a similar C-terminal region, and CtBPS, which lacks it. The expression of the two isoforms is developmentally regulated and the C-terminal coding region is evolutionarily conserved [9]. CtBP has been shown to bind NAD and NADH, which affects the conformation of the protein and its affinity for E1A. The binding of the dinucleotide has also been reported to alter its oligomerization properties [10≠12]. A differential affinity for NADH over NAD has been suggested to allow this factor to respond to changes in cellular redox status in vivo, and treatment of cells with agents that affect NAD/NADH ratios affect gene expression in a CtBP dependent manner. Other reports do not find differences in effects of the oxidized and reduced dinucleotides on CtBP in vitro, however [10≠12]. Consistent with their structural similarity to dehydrogenases, CtBP proteins can catalyze an NAD-dependent pyruvate-to-lactate dehydrogenase reaction in vitro that requires the conserved catalytic histidine residue [11,12]. It is not clear, however, whether this putative enzymatic activity or NAD binding are important for CtBP function in vivo. Repression assays comparing the activities of mutant forms of CtBP have not produced completely consistent results. Three general types of cell-based assays have tested the ability of CtBP to mediate transcriptional repression, those using endogenous promoters (some coupled to reporter genes), those with artificial constructs that are regulated by CtBPs (e.g. Gal4-E1A fusions), and assays using promoters bound by Gal4-CtBP chimeras. In most cases, forms of CtBP lacking catalytic site residues (including the conserved histidine) are functional, although one report found that such mutations blocked E1A association in vitro and abolished repression in vivo [11]. In three cases, mutations that disrupt residues of the nucleotide binding pocket blocked transcriptional repression activity, while another report did not find any effect of such mutations [11,13≠15]. Apart from these cell-based assays, the significance of the NAD binding and putative catalytic activity of CtBP remains to be determined in a developmental context, where these proteins are known to play critical roles. A number of studies have indicated that CtBP proteins are located in the cytoplasm and likely carry out functions unrelated to transcription, such as regulation of Golgi function, and synaptic transmission in retinal cells [16].

P. Mani-Telang et al. / FEBS Letters 581 (2007) 5241≠5246 anti-M2 with non-transgenic embryo extracts was performed in parallel as negative controls. Beads were washed thrice in lysis buffer and eluted in 40 ll of Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates or extracts from adults, prepared by pestling and sonication, were run on 10% SDS≠PAGE gels and analyzed by western blotting using antiCtBP (rabbit polyclonal, 1:10 000) and Immuno-Blot‰ PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) [19]. Antibody incubation was performed in TBST (20 mM Tris≠HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) with 5% non-fat dry milk. Mouse monoclonal antibodies used were M2 antiFLAG (Sigma) (1:10 000) and anti-tubulin (1:6000, Iowa Hybridoma Bank). Blots were developed using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) and SuperSignal“ West Pico chemiluminiscent substrate (Pierce). Western blot quantitation shown in Fig. 2 is representative for more than three independent experiments. For immunoprecipitation experiments shown in Fig. 3, independent immunoprecipitations were conducted from separate biological preparations 2≠3 times, with identical results. 2.3. P-element transformation and antibody staining of imaginal discs Drosophila germline transformation with P element vectors was performed as described previously [17]. Imaginal discs dissected from third instar larvae were fixed in antibody staining buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 15 mM NaCl, 45 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl2) and 37% formaldehyde on ice for 45 min. For detection of FLAGtagged proteins, anti-M2 was used at a concentration of 1:1500, and developed using a universal secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (1:250). Discs were mounted in 80% glycerol and the expression pattern was visualized using an Elite PK-62000 Universal Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories Inc., Manufacturer's protocol). 2.4. Recombinant CtBP proteins and gel filtration chromatography For protein expression, CtBP cDNAs were cloned into a modified pET15b expression vector using Kpn I and Not I restriction sites. The CAT¿ mutant cDNA contained 2 FLAG-tags at the C-terminus,

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Transgene construction CtBP cDNA fragments (Accession Nos. AY060646, dCtBPL; AB011840, dCtBPS) were amplified by PCR to introduce KpnI and XbaI sites at 5 0 and 3 0 ends, respectively, and modified to introduce a double C-terminal FLAG epitope tag [17]. For tissue-specific expression, the cDNAs were inserted into a modified pUAST vector containing KpnI and XbaI sites downstream of a consensus Drosophila Kozak sequence (DA 683 5 0 -GATCACCCGGGACCAAAATGGGTAC-3 0 and DA 684 5 0 -CCATTTTGGTCCCGGGT-3 0 ) [18]. NAD¿ and CAT¿ mutants were described previously [17]. In the DIM¿ mutant, arginine codons (R141A, R142A, R163A and R171A) were modified in dCtBPL. For ubiquitous expression, the basal hsp70 promoter and 5X UAS sites were removed from pUAST by digestion with SphI and KpnI, and an oligonucleotide was introduced containing SphI, AscI, Kozak, and KpnI sites (DA 885 5 0 -CACCGGCGCGCCACCAAAATGGGTAC-3 0 ; DA 886 5 0 -CCATTTTGGTGGCGCGCCGGTGCATG-3 0 ). An 8 kp CtBP upstream promoter region (CG88373238845092) was inserted as two 4 kbp SphI≠SphI and SphI≠AscI fragments using DA 926 (5 0 -GTGCATGCGAAATGGTTAGCCAGCGTGGTG-3 0 ), DA 927 (5 0 -CGGGCGCGCCTTGAAATCGAGAATCCTGCAATGG-3 0 ), DA 924 (5 0 -CTGCATGCATACCATAATTCTTGCAGTTTGCC-3 0 ) and DA 925 (5 0 -CGGCATGCAGCTTTCTGTTTCATGCATATGCAC-3 0 ). 2.2. Immunoprecipitations and western blot analysis Embryos (0≠12 h) were collected from transgenic lines expressing FLAG-tagged CtBP proteins, resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA with Complete mini-EDTA free protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche) and sonicated. Soluble lysates (20 mg total protein) were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 ∞C with 25 ll of anti-M2 crosslinked to protein G beads. Immunoprecipitation with mouse monoclonal IgG and

Twenty-five milliliters of log phase bacterial cultures were induced with 0.8 mM IPTG overnight at 16 ∞C. The cells were collected, resuspended in buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole with Roche cocktail protease inhibitor tablet and 12.5% b-mercaptoethanol), sonicated and centrifuged to separate soluble supernatant fraction. 0.1% Triton X was added to supernatant before incubation with Ni2+-NTA beads (Sigma) at 4 ∞C for 3 h. The beads were washed thrice in the same buffer with 20 mM imidazole and eluted with 250 mM imidazole. Approximately 10 lg of purified protein was fractionated on a Superdex 200 10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham) equilibrated with buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.1 mM EDTA,10% glycerol). 0.5 ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Pools of fractions were resolved on SDS≠PAGE gels and analyzed by western blotting using M2 anti-FLAG antibody. Size markers (MW-GF-1000, Sigma) were separated under similar conditions for calibration. The migration of the NAD¿ mutant as a dimer was confirmed by two independent chromatographic separations.

3. Results 3.1. Expression and biological activity of wild-type and dehydrogenase domain mutants in vivo To investigate the functional relevance of conserved residues within CtBP, we generated mutant forms for expression in transgenic Drosophila. cDNAs for the ``long'' form of CtBP containing the C-terminal extension [9] were generated that carried mutations for conserved glycine residues critical for NAD binding (NAD¿), or the histidine residue that is required for dehydrogenase activity in CtBP and related dehydrogenase enzymes (CAT¿), or four arginine residues predicted to lie at the dimer interface (DIM¿) (Fig. 1A) [5,11]. Using the pUAS system, these cDNAs were expressed in the developing eye disc using a GMR-Gal4 driver or in the wing disc using the en-Gal4 driver. Ectopic expression of the wild-type CtBPL protein or

3.2. Dimerization of CtBP isoforms The similar phenotypes and levels of expression of the wildtype CtBPL and the CAT¿ mutants suggests that the mutant protein retains biological activity despite absence of a residue critical for dehydrogenase activity. Similar results have been noted in most cell-based assays, which have been usually conducted in the presence of the wild-type endogenous CtBP. CtBP is a dimeric protein, therefore we considered that the CAT¿ mutant might be capable of forming heterodimers with endogenous CtBP. To test this idea, we prepared lysates from Drosophila expressing the CAT¿ mutant protein, as well as lines expressing the wild-type CtBPL and CtBPS isoforms. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with anti-FLAG antibody specific for the recombinant protein, and Western blots were developed using anti-CtBP antibody to detect both endogenous and recombinant proteins. As shown in Fig. 3A, endogenous CtBP isoforms specifically co-immunoprecipitate with the CAT¿ mutant protein, consistent with the formation of heterodimers between these proteins. In light of these results, it is possible that biologically active CAT¿/wild-type heterodimers may mask the loss of dehydrogenase activity in one subunit, although this would not explain our misexpression phenotype, as discussed below. Immunoprecipitations also showed that ectopically expressed wild-type CtBPL and CtBPS specifically coprecipitated with both forms of endogenous CtBP proteins, indicating that in Drosophila, CtBP dimers may possess either one or two C-terminal extension domains, or entirely lack this domain that is suggested to be of regulatory significance (Fig. 3B and C) [9]. 3.3. Physical studies of mutant proteins The low steady-state levels of the DIM¿ mutant suggest that a defect in CtBP dimerization may destabilize the protein. Previous work showed that in vitro dimerization of the wild-type protein is stimulated by the presence of NAD(H), thus it seemed possible that the NAD¿ mutation may similarly

the CAT¿ mutant induced wing blisters or rough eyes in a high percentage of offspring (Fig. 1, Table 1). In contrast, expression of the NAD¿ or DIM¿ mutants did not result in an obvious phenotype in this assay (Table 1). The developmental defects observed here may be due to a number of regulatory changes; CtBP participates in control of a number of genes in the eye and wing, and misexpression of other corepressors such as Rbf1 has been observed to induce similar phenotypes [20,21]. The misexpressed transgenes carry a C-terminal FLAG tag that permits detection of the recombinant protein. To compare relative expression levels of the different transgenes, protein extracts were prepared from individual adult flies expressing one form of CtBP. Wild-type and CAT¿ proteins were found to be present at comparable levels, while the steady-state levels of the NAD¿ or DIM¿ proteins were considerably reduced (Fig. 2A). Larval protein levels were assessed by immunostaining of developing eye discs, with similar low levels noted for the NAD¿ or DIM¿ proteins (Fig. 2B). These differences in protein levels were not a result of position effects of the transgene insertion sites, because steady-state levels for each construct were very similar for multiple independent transgenic lines, and for constructs driven by different promoters (data not shown).

prevent dimerization by blocking association of NAD(H), leading to destabilization [12,22]. To test this idea, we expressed each form of the protein in E. coli and measured the migration profiles using size exclusion chromatography. Comparing elution profiles of wild-type CtBP to those of molecular weight standards, the peak fraction for CtBPL was close to 150 kDa, suggesting that this protein is already in a dimeric state, consistent with the migration pattern observed for recombinant vertebrate CtBP (Fig. 4). This pattern did not change with addition of NAD (not shown), probably because the protein is already bound to dinucleotide acquired during

Similar amounts (approximately 10 lg) of each Flag-tagged purified CtBP proteins were individually subjected to size exclusion chromatography. Wild-type, CAT-, and NAD-mutant proteins eluted with similar profiles, consistent with dimer formation ($150 kDa). DIMmutant proteins eluted in later fractions, consistent with monomers.

protein expression [5]. The CAT¿ mutant protein had a similar profile, with the peak fractions overlapping with those for the wild-type. Significantly, the DIM¿ mutant had a markedly displaced peak, with most of the protein eluting in later fractions, consistent with the monomeric form. This result correlates with the inability of a similar mutant form of vertebrate CtBP protein to bind to immobilized GST-CtBP [11]. Importantly, the NAD¿ mutant protein eluted with a profile very similar to that of the wild-type and CAT¿ mutant, and not similar to the DIM¿ mutant (Fig. 4). (Similar amounts of each recombinant protein were applied to the column, thus these mutant forms are of similar abundance as the wild-type protein, unlike the situation in Fig. 2A) These data strongly suggest that disrupting the NAD binding cleft does not prevent dimerization, thus the low expression levels of this form of the protein may reflect an altered conformation, rather than an inability to form dimers.

4. Discussion The conservation of NAD-binding and catalytic residues in CtBP raised the possibility that this transcriptional cofactor may possess a conserved enzymatic activity, perhaps similar to the NAD-dependent deacetylation function of Sir2 proteins. However, no such in vitro deacetylase activity has been identified, rather, a weak dehydrogenase activity, and a putative acyl transferase or acyl-CoA binding activity, the latter of which has been recently suggested to correspond to an associated or contaminating activity, not to CtBP itself [16,23]. Our data in Drosophila, and other studies in vertebrate cells, strongly suggest that residues of the catalytic site are not required for in vivo function. One documented CAT¿ mutant that is impaired for in vivo activity involved more extensive mutations to four residues within the putative catalytic center, which resulted in a protein unable to bind to a target E1A protein [11]. However, a mutation to the single conserved histidine, as in the CAT¿ mutant tested here, is sufficient to abolish in vitro dehy-

drogenase activity [12]. We determined that the CAT¿ mutant is capable of dimerizing with wild-type CtBP, but if the mutant protein would only be functional as a heterodimer, it does not seem likely that we would be able to achieve levels sufficient to generate an overexpression phenotype, because heterodimers would increase the overall levels of CtBP by at most twofold. We have found that low-levels of misexpression of CtBP proteins do not produce phenotypes (P. Mani-Telang, unpublished). Furthermore, a similar CAT¿ mutant protein tested in CtBP¿ cells, where heterodimerization is not a possibility, had wild-type activity [14]. On the other hand, several studies indicate that NAD binding appears to be an important feature of CtBP protein. Mutations that block NAD interaction prevent CtBP from associating with E1A and repressing transcription [11]. We found that even when the protein is tethered to a target gene by the Gal4 DNA binding domain, NAD binding residues were critical for transcriptional repression in embryos [17]. The previously observed NAD-stimulated CtBP dimer formation provided a potential explanation of these results, in that loss of NAD binding might prevent dimers from forming. However, we explicitly test this idea in Fig. 4, and we do not see a change in dimerization with the NAD¿ mutant, which carries mutations in glycines known to be critical for NAD binding by CtBP and related proteins. A more likely explanation is that NAD, which binds the Rossman fold in a ``closed'' conformation, and affects CtBP conformation in vitro, permits the protein to make critical contacts with essential transcriptional factors or cofactors. The question arises whether this proposed structural role for NAD in assembly of CtBP complexes serves a regulatory role as well. Treatments affecting NAD/NADH ratios in vertebrate cells lead to loss of CtBP association with target genes and the HIC transcription factor, thus CtBP may function as a redox sensitive switch, in which NAD(H) binding plays an important role [24]. Further examination of the function of CtBP proteins in a developmental setting will provide insight on the physiological significance of these activities.
