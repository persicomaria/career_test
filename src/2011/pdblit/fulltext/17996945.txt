C1r, C1s and the mannose-binding lectin-associated serine proteases (MASPs) are responsible for the initiation of the classical- and lectin pathway activation of the complement system. These enzymes do not act alone, but form supramolecular complexes with pattern recognition molecules such as C1q, MBL, and ficolins. They share the same domain organization but have different substrate specificities and fulfill different physiological functions. In the recent years the rapid progress of structural biology facilitated the understanding of the molecular mechanism of complement activation at atomic level. In this review we summarize our current knowledge about the structure and function of the early complement proteases, delineate the latest models of the multimolecular complexes and present the functional consequences inferred from the structural studies. We also discuss some open questions and debated issues that need to be resolved in the future. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The initiating proteases of the complement classical pathway, C1r and C1s have been under investigation for more than 50 years. C1s, earlier called "C1 esterase", was known in the 1950s (Ratnoff and Lepow, 1957). The C1 complex was separated into its constituent proteins C1r, C1s and C1q (Lepow et al., 1963), and C1r and C1s were shown to be serine protease proenzymes and characterized in terms of primary structure and enzymatic properties in the 1970s and 1980s (summarized by Campbell et al., 1988). The stoichiometry of the C1 complex (C1qr2 s2 ) was established by 1977 (Ziccardi and Cooper, 1977), and structural models of the C1 complex based mainly on electron microscopy and on functional studies were available by 1987 (Schumaker et al., 1987; Colomb and Arlaud, 1987). When complement-like proteolytic activity associated with MBL was discovered by Ikeda et al. (1987), with the observation of MBLdependent lysis of mannan-coated sheep erythrocytes, it was at first assumed that MBL associated with the classical pathway proteases C1r and C1s to make a complex like C1 (but with MBL in place of C1q). However a C1s-like protease (called MBL-associated

serine protease = MASP) was co-isolated with MBL (Matsushita and Fujita, 1992). A second MASP, MASP-2, was discovered during the search for a conglutinin-like protein from human plasma (Thiel et al., 1997). The first MASP was then renamed as MASP-1. At that time it was tempting to think that the MBL-MASPs complex was very like C1, with MASP-1 and MASP-2 being equivalent to C1r and C1s. Sequence data showed that MASP-1 and MASP-2 were homologues of C1r and C1s, with the same domain structure. Each protease (monomer) is about 75­85 kDa, with domains in the order CUB1EGF-CUB2-CCP1-CCP2-SP (Fig. 1). However another serine protease MASP-3 was discovered (Dahl et al., 2001) associated with MBL during affinity purifications of MBL-MASPs complexes, and by this time it was clear that MBL-MASPs complexes were not directly comparable in assembly to C1, nor were MASP-1 and -2 directly comparable (in function) to C1r and C1s. However studies of the differences and similarities in the assembly of the two types of complex is leading rapidly to a much better understanding of both. Comparative studies benefit from the relatively recent findings that the MASPs also form complexes with the ficolins (H-, L- and M-ficolin), which, like MBL and C1q, bind to targets, including microbes and apoptotic cells, and activate complement (for review, see Wallis et al., 2008). During the characterization of MASP-2, a 19 kDa protein was discovered in MBL-MASPs preparations which reacted with antiMASP-2 antibodies. Subsequent gene sequencing revealed that this 19 kDa protein is a truncated alternative splicing product of the MASP-2 gene, and it has an identical sequence of CUB1 and EGF domain to MASP-2 along with four unique amino acids at the C-terminal end. This protein was named MAp19 or sMAP (summarized by Vorup-Jensen and Jensenius, 2008)

Fig. 1. Schematic cartoon representation of the domain structure of C1r, C1s, MASP1, MASP-2, and MASP-3. The depicted model was assembled from actual X-ray structures of MASP-1 fragments (CUB1-EGF-CUB2, PDB code: 3dem; and CCP1CCP2-SP, PDB code: 3gov). The relative orientation of the two fragments is arbitrary.

Human MASPs 1, 2 and 3 and MAp19 are alternative splicing products of only two genes. MASP-1 and MASP-3 are the products of the MASP1/3 gene on chromosome 3q27-q28 (Dahl et al., 2001). Despite being products of the same gene, they vary in site of synthesis, since MASP-1 is expressed only in liver whereas MASP-3 is expressed in the liver but also in spleen, lung, small intestine, thymus and brain (Lynch et al., 2005). MASP-1 and -3 have identical CUB-EGF-CUB-CCP-CCP domains, but different SP domains. Human MASP-2 and MAp19 are alternative splicing products of the MASP-2 gene on chromosome 1p36.2-3 (Stover et al., 1999) and are synthesized in liver only (Schwaeble et al., 2002; Stover et al., 2004). 2. Structures of proteases and their inhibitor Although functional studies can provide valuable mechanistic insight into complement activation, the necessary stereochemical information can only be supplied by X-ray crystallography or NMR. The prerequisite for the application of these methods is the availability of sufficient amounts of the proteases with the required purity. Cloning, recombinant expression and large scale purification of C1r, C1s and MASP-1,-2, and-3 paved the road to successful crystallographic studies. The first breakthrough was the expression of the complete C1r molecule in insect cells using a baculovirus vector (Gál et al., 1989). The elongated, flexible multidomain character of all these serine proteases has been, up to now, an unbreakable obstacle in the crystallization attempts of the full-length proteins. Fragments containing various domain combinations have been expressed and were successfully crystallized. The recombinant catalytic fragment (CCP2-SP) of human C1s, expressed in insect cells, was first crystallized, and the structure was solved and refined to 1.7 Å resolution. The structure reveals restricted access to subsidiary binding sites in the SP domain, explaining the narrow substrate specificity of C1s (Gaboriaud et al., 2000). Production and handling of C1r seem to be more difficult than C1s regarding crystallization and X-ray diffraction studies. First the solution structure of the EGF-like module was published by Bersch et al. (1998). Next the 3D structure of the zymogen catalytic domain of C1r was solved by Budayova-Spano et al. (2002a). From the structure they concluded that disruptive mechanical stress is required to trigger activation of the C1 complex. The structures of the activated (wild-type) and zymogen (S637A mutant) recombinant CCP2-SP monomer fragments of C1r were also solved (Budayova-Spano et al., 2002b). The active structure shows hindered access to several substrate binding elements on the SP domain. Like in the case of C1s this is the structural background of the restricted substrate specificity of C1r. The X-ray structure of the entire active catalytic region of human C1r was recently published (Kardos et al., 2008). The activated CCP1-CCP2-SP fragment makes up a dimmer in a head-to-tail arrangement like the zymogen. Based on these structural information a new "split and reassembly" model was outlined for the autoactivation of C1r. This model will be described in details in the following section. The MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP-1, MASP-2 and MASP-3) are about an order of magnitude less abundant in blood

than C1r and C1s, and were discovered only recently. This delay is also reflected in structural studies on these enzymes. The first Xray structure of the activated form of CCP2-SP fragment of human MASP-2 was only published in 2004 (Harmat et al., 2004). The structure revealed that the almost identical substrate specificities of C1s and MASP-2 are realized through different sets of interactions. The structure of the catalytic region of zymogen MASP-2 was also solved (Gál et al., 2005). Based on the zymogen and the active MASP2 structures a model for the "substrate induced" autoactivation was proposed, which will be detailed in this review. The catalytic fragment of MASP-1 has been crystallized recently (Dobó et al., 2008a,b). The structure can explain the unusually broad substrate specificity of MASP-1 compared to other complement proteases. Complement activation is a delicately regulated cascade procedure. The early complement proteases cannot be discussed without mentioning their physiological inhibitor, the serpin-type C1-inhibitor (C1-inh) (for review, see Davis et al., 2008). C1-inh is a single chain glycoprotein having two-domain architecture. The N-terminal domain which is heavily glycosylated, is not essential for proteinase inhibition (Coutinho et al., 1994). After decades of struggle a previously unreported latent form of the N-terminally truncated human C1-inh (the serpin domain) has been crystallized and the 3D structure was solved at 2.35 Å resolution (Beinrohr et al., 2007). Engineering of recombinant C1-inh, adjustment of yeast fermentation conditions, and enzymatic removal of glycans were decisive factors in the success of crystallization. The overall structure resembles those of other serpins, with highly conserved nine -helixes and three -sheets. However the structure displays a previously unobserved latent conformation with seven-stranded arrangement in -sheet A. The structure offers structural explanation for a number of mutational C1-inh deficiency diseases, and reveals the molecular mechanism of heparin potentiation based on the surface charge pattern of C1-inh. Detailed discussion about the structure and the potential application of C1-inh as an antiinflammatory agent is given by Beinrohr et al. (2008).

3. Structure-based refinement of C1 activation models C1, the first component of the classical pathway, has been for a long time one of the most extensively studied supramolecular complexes of the complement system. The C1 complex consists of a recognition molecule C1q and a Ca2+ dependent association of four serine proteases: two C1r and two C1s molecules, which form a heterotetramer. Although many data have been accumulated concerning the structure and activation of the individual components as well as the whole complex during the last 30 years, we still do not have a clear-cut picture about the atomic structure of C1 and the molecular mechanism of its activation. The size (790 kDa), complexity and flexibility of the C1 complex make it a challenging object for the structural biologist. Structure of fragments of C1q (Gaboriaud et al., 2003), C1r (Bersch et al., 1998; Budayova-Spano et al., 2002a; Budayova-Spano et al., 2002b; Kardos et al., 2008), and C1s (Gaboriaud et al., 2000; Gregory et al., 2003) representing approximately two thirds of the whole complex has been solved by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Since we do not have structure of any full-length component let alone the entire complex, the current models of C1 are built from mosaics and the gaps are often filled with speculative elements. In this section we will focus mainly on the structure and autoactivation of C1r inside the C1 complex. C1q is the pattern recognition molecule of the C1 complex and it also yields a scaffold for the C1s­C1r­C1r­C1s tetramer. C1q can recognize and bind to activator structures of different nature (e.g. immune complexes, C-reactive protein, LPS, apoptotic cells, etc.) and convey activation signal(s) to the proenzyme C1r molecules.

Amino acid sequence, electron microscope observations, and other physical studies proved that C1q has a hexameric structure resembling a bouquet of six tulips with six C-terminal heterotrimeric globular heads connected to six collagen-like arms that merge into a central stem near the N-terminus (Reid and Porter, 1976; Kishore and Reid, 2000). At the kink region, where the arms diverge from the stem the typical Gly-X-Y collagen sequence repeat is interrupted which may be a source of flexibility in the C1q molecule. C1r and C1s, like the early proteases of the lectin pathway (i.e. MASP-1, MASP-2 and MASP-3), has a six-domain-structure. At the N-terminal half of the molecules the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domain triplet mediates the Ca2+ dependent C1r­C1s interaction as well as the interaction between the C1s­C1r­C1r­C1s tetramer and the collagen-like C1q arms. The C-terminal catalytic region (the B fragment) consists of two CCP (complement control protein) modules and the trypsin-like serine protease (SP) domain. The CCP1­CCP2­SP fragments show all the catalytic properties which are characteristic of the full-length proteases. In the case of C1r, this fragment is responsible for the homodimerization providing the core of the C1s­C1r­C1r­C1s tetramer. C1q and the tetramer spontaneously assemble to form the C1 complex when they are mixed in equimolar proportions. Electron microscopic measurements, neutron scattering analyses, X-ray crystallographic picture of different fragments, symmetry and functional considerations led to the development of low resolution models of the C1 complex (Schumaker et al., 1987; Gaboriaud et al., 2004). According to the most widely accepted C1 models the C1s­C1r­C1r­C1s tetramer is folded around the C1q arms in an "8-shaped" conformation making possible the interaction between the catalytic domains of the proteases during the activation process. The first enzymatic event during the classical pathway is the autoactivation of C1r zymogens that takes place upon C1q binding to the activator structure (Dodds et al., 1978). In the subsequent step activated C1r cleaves zymogen C1s, active C1s then cleaves C4 and C2, the components of the classical pathway C3 convertase complex. A functional model of the C1 complex should answer the following questions: (1) How the components of the C1 complex can readily associate to form the complex. (2) How the activation signal is transmitted from the C1q to the C1r zymogens. (3) How zymogen C1r autoactivates after receiving the activational signal (and what mechanism prevents spontaneous autoactivation). (4) How C1r activates C1s inside the complex. (5) How C1s is able to cleave C4 and C2 in the fluid phase. (6) How C1-inhibitor gains access to both C1r and C1s in the complex to block their activity and disassemble the complex. There is no C1 model that can satisfactorily answer all these questions at the moment. The most popular "8-shaped" models have been refined using the latest results of the structure determination of the fragments. An important step was the structure determination of the CUB1-EGF region of C1s (Gregory et al., 2003) that made possible modeling the interface of the C1r­C1s heterodimer and also the interaction with C1q. According to this model the major binding sites for C1q are provided by the EGF modules of C1r. This model places the catalytic region of C1r dimer inside the cone formed by the six C1q arms while the other parts of C1r and the entire C1s molecule can be outside. Very recently a new model for the C1q-tetramer association has been proposed based on site directed mutagenesis experiments which overwrites the previous model (Bally et al., 2008). According to the mutagenesis experiments the C1q-tetramer interaction is mediated mainly by the CUB1 and CUB2 modules of C1r and to a lesser extent by the CUB1 module of C1s. This new model places the entire tetramer inside the C1q cone. The central event of the C1 activation is the autoactivation of C1r, since it is the first enzymatic step in the classical pathway and a recognition event is converted into an enzymatic signal. The determination of the crystal structure of the CCP1­CCP2­SP

Fig. 2. Structure of the catalytic region of active C1r shows an enzyme-substrate-like contact. In the active C1r dimer (PDB code: 2gy0) the major interaction is between the SP domain of one molecule and the CCP1 domain of the other (shown in the box). However each C1r molecule has another important contact with the neighboring C1r molecule. Arg446 of the cleaved activation loop sits in the S1 substrate binding pocket of the other molecule. This contact may represent the intermediate during C1r autoactivation in the C1 complex.

catalytic fragment of both the zymogen (Budayova-Spano et al., 2002a) and the activated (Kardos et al., 2008) form of C1r contributed to the understanding of the autoactivation process. Both forms of C1r make homodimers in a head-to-tail fashion where the CCP1 module of one monomer interacts with the SP domain of the other monomer and vice versa. A striking feature of this arrangement is the presence of a large opening (30 Å × 13 Å) in the middle of the dimer separating the two SP domains apart from each other. During autoactivation a direct physical contact must take place between the two SP domains, however in the crystal structures the active site of one monomer and the cleavage site of the other one are separated by a distance of 92 Å. It is obvious that a transient conformation must exist during autoactivation which makes possible the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex between the two SP domains. In this respect the structure of the activated form of C1r is very informative, since in the crystal lattice there is an enzyme-product relationship between the C1r molecules of neighboring dimers (Fig. 2). The S1 specificity site of one C1r molecule is occupied with Arg446 of the other C1r forming the crucial S1­P1 salt bridge with Asp631. This transient enzyme-product complex is stabilized by intermolecular CCP2­SP interactions. Previous kinetic measurements showed that although the single SP domain is capable of autoactivation the presence of the CCP2 module greatly enhances the rate of autoactivation in solution phase (Kardos et al., 2001). We have also shown that there is an exchange of monomers between C1r dimers in solution phase (Dobó et al., 1999), which means that dissociation and reassociation of C1r dimers occur spontaneously although the equilibrium is strongly shifted towards the dimer form at physiological pH. According to our "split-and-reassembly" activation model (Kardos et al., 2008) the binding of C1q heads to the target surface results in the change in the relative position of the C1q arms which shifts the equilibrium to the dissociated form of the C1r dimer. For this dissociation there is no need for a linear pulling apart of the monomers in a well defined direction to bring together the two SP domains as suggested by other activation models (Arlaud et al., 2007). C1q heads can bind to an irregular pattern of binding sites resulting in an indefinite change of the distances between the C1q heads and angles of the C1q arms (not excluding the possibility of shrinkage). After dissociation the enzyme-substrate complex is formed between the SP domains. The complex formation is facilitated by the probable flexibility provided by the five N-terminal modules and/or their junctions and by the intermolecular CCP2­SP interactions. After autoactivation the head-to-tail dimer form of C1r can be

2748

easily restored. Crystal structure of the activated C1r dimer shows an increased number of stabilizing interactions between the CCP1 and SP domains which means that the equilibrium will be shifted towards the functional active dimer form. Since the active sites of the C1r SP domains are facing outwards they are easily accessible for the cleavable C1s SP domains as well as for C1-inhibitor. The tightened C1r­C1r core structure provides a stable frame for activated C1s, which has to be exposed to the solution to cleave C4 and C2. A major assumption of all functional C1 models is the significant flexibility of the C1s­C1r­C1r­C1s tetramer and that of the whole complex. Crystal structures indicate that there is a flexible junction between the CCP2 and SP domains in the C1r molecule. This flexibility could help in orienting the SP domain to the cleavable substrate, however it is not enough to provide the overall flexibility necessary for C1 activation. Other sources of flexibility could be the CCP1­CCP2 junctions and the CUB2-CCP1 region. 4. MASP-2, an active "zymogen". Analogy and differences with C1s MASP-2 is the key enzyme of the lectin pathway. It can autoactivate and generate C3-convertase by cleaving C4 and C2. A complex containing a dimeric MBL molecule and two MASP-2 subunits represents the minimal complement fixing unit of the lectin pathway (Chen and Wallis, 2001). C1s, the executive protease of the C1 complex, has many things in common with MASP-2. MASP-2 and C1s have almost the same substrate specificity (C4 and C2 cleavage), but MASP-2 can also activate prothrombin, a property not shared by C1s. (Krarup et al., 2007). A further significant difference is that MASP-2 can autoactivate while C1s cannot. C1s is a stable zymogen until it is cleaved by C1r (Dodds et al., 1978). Actually, a MASP-2 dimer in the MBL-(MASP-2)2 complex can perform the same activity as the C1s­C1r­C1r­C1s tetramer in the C1 complex. MASP-2 and C1s share the same domain architecture. The roles of the different domains are also very similar. It was shown that the isolated SP domain of both MASP-2 and C1s can cleave the C2 substrate as efficiently as the full-length molecules (Ambrus et al., 2003; Rossi et al., 1998). For efficient C4 cleavage however the presence of the CCP modules are necessary. It is very probable that the CCP modules contain extra binding site(s) for the bulky C4 substrate. The crystal structure of the CCP2-SP fragment of C1s and MASP-2 supports this presumption (Gaboriaud et al., 2000; Harmat et al., 2004). The ellipsoidal CCP2 module is oriented perpendicularly to the surface of the spherical SP domain so that it can serve as an extension of the recognition site of the catalytic domain. Domain swapping experiments between C1s and MASP-2 also demonstrated that the higher C4 cleavage efficiency of MASP-2 arises from the higher substrate recognition ability of its CCP modules (Rossi et al., 2005). Both SP domains show the typical chymotrypsin fold: two six-stranded barrels packed against each other with the catalytic triad (Ser195, His57, Asp102, chymotrypsin numbering) located at the junction of the two barrels. The S1 and other substrate binding sub-sites are determined by eight surface loops (Perona and Craik, 1997). The extremely narrow substrate specificity of these enzymes (including also C1r) can be explained by the restricted access of sub-sites due to the conformation of these loops. It was expected that C1s and MASP-2 should have similar loop structure. Surprisingly, however, the length, amino acid composition and conformation of most surface loops in the SP domain of MASP-2 are different from those of C1s (Harmat et al., 2004). We can conclude that the nearly identical substrate specificity of these proteases is mediated through different sets of enzyme-substrate interactions. It is very likely that the major functional difference (i.e. the autoactivating ability of MASP2) is reflected in the different loop structures of the two enzymes. The crystal structure of the zymogen form of the CCP1­CCP2­SP fragment of MASP-2 has also been determined (Gál et al., 2005).
Fig. 3. Superimposed structures of active and zymogen MASP-2 shown near the S1 pocket and the active site. The catalytic triad is in a nearly identical position in both molecules, however the oxyanion hole is distorted, Asp189, the crucial residue in the S1 pocket responsible for P1 Arg specificity, is turned outward, and Arg 192 blocks the S1 site in zymogen MASP-2. Zymogen MASP-2 (PDB code: 1zjk) is colored yellow, while active MASP-2 (PDB code: 1q3x) is green, except for segments with nearly identical backbone conformation, which are grey. The catalytic triad, Asp189, and Arg192 side chains are shown as stick (oxygen is red, nitrogen is blue, while carbon atoms are colored yellow or green, in zymogen and active MASP-2, respectively). Gly193, involved in the formation of the oxyanion hole, is pink or dark blue, in zymogen and active MASP-2, respectively. Chymotrypsin numbering is used for easy identification.

The zymogen SP domain exhibits the features of a typical trypsinlike zymogen: an almost intact catalytic triad but severely distorted oxyanion hole (an indispensable part of the catalytic machinery) and substrate binding pocket (Fig. 3). The zymogen catalytic fragment, as expected, cannot cleave small synthetic substrates. Surprisingly, however, it can cleave C4 quite efficiently. The "zymogenicity" (i.e. the ratio of the catalytic power of the active and the zymogen forms) of MASP-2 in the case of C4 is very low (8). To explain this phenomenon we have to assume that (1) the singlechain inactive form of MASP-2 can temporarily be converted into an active species without the cleavage of the activation peptide and (2) this conversion is induced by the big protein substrate (C4). In this respect it is very important to note that the structure of the CCP modules do not change during the autoactivation process, thus the substrate binding exosites are present already on the zymogen molecule. The large C4 molecule can bind to zymogen MASP-2 (Chen and Wallis, 2004) through the CCP modules and induce the zymogen-active transition by making extended contacts with the SP domain. The small synthetic substrates can make only a few contacts with the catalytic center which is not sufficient for inducing an overall conformational change. This substrate-induced activation mechanism could be responsible for autoactivation. In the MBL-(MASP-2)2 complex the catalytic domains of the two MASP-2 protomers can easily contact each other and an enzymesubstrate complex can form resulting the cleavage of the activation peptide. Structural studies, computational modeling and mutagenesis experiments validated the substrate-induced mechanism of autoactivation (Gál et al., 2005; Kocsis et al., unpublished results). A similar mechanism could be responsible for the autoactivation of the other early complement proteases (e.g. C1r, MASP-1). It should be noted that an analog mechanism of "substrate-induced catalysis" was proposed for the activation of complement proteases factor D (Volanakis and Narayana, 1996), factor B (Milder et al., 2007) and C2 (Milder et al., 2006), too. This new paradigm arose from the rapid progress of the structural biochemistry of the complement system. As noted above, MASP-2 can also activate prothrombin to produce active thrombin (Krarup et al., 2007). C1r, C1s and MASP-1 do not have this activity. Prothrombin activation requires two specific

cleavages of prothrombin, at Arg273­Thr274 and Arg322­Ile323, and apart from Factor Xa, the natural activator of prothrombin within the coagulation system, no other mammalian proteases apart from tryptase have been reported to have this activity. Binding of MBL-MASP-2 complexes to a target (mannan) and subsequent activation of MASP-2 leads not only to complement activation, but also to formation of cross-linked fibrin and the generation of chemotactic fibrinopeptides A and B (via cleavage of fibrinogen and Factor XIII by the generated thrombin). The subtle differences in substrate specificity between MASP-2 and C1s are also reflected in their reaction with plasma protease inhibitors. Both activated C1s and activated MASP-2 appear to be regulated mainly by the serpin, C1-inhibitor (C1-inh). However, MASP­2 can also be inhibited (at a lower rate than with C1-inh) by antithrombin (in the presence or absence of heparin) and by 2-Macroglobulin (Ambrus et al., 2003; Presanis et al., 2004). C1s does not react with 2-Macroglobulin, and is generally thought to be regulated only by C1-inh (Sim et al., 1979a). However, there is a single report of C1s being inhibited by antithrombin in the presence of heparin (Ogston et al., 1976). Considering the regulation of the activity of the whole C1 complex by plasma protease inhibitors, both activated C1r and C1s react with C1-inh, such that the C1s­C1r­C1r­C1s heterotetramer reacts with 4 C1-inh molecules, and is dissociated into 2 (C1inh­C1r­C1s­C1-inh) complexes, which then dissociate from C1q (Sim et al., 1979b). This is thought to be important in that it leaves the collagen region of C1q unoccupied, so that it can bind to C1q receptor (a receptor which also binds MBL) (Sim et al., 1998). The regulation of MBL-MASPs or ficolin-MASPs complexes has not been studied so extensively, but it is likely that at least for complexes with MASP-2, the activated MASP-2 dimer will react preferentially with C1-inh, to form complexes which may be monomeric MASP2-C1-inh or dimeric (MASP-2-C1-inh)2 . There is no information on whether these dissociate from MBL to leave the MBL collagenous region available for receptor binding. 5. MASP-1, a promiscuous protease MASP-1 was originally discovered as the only serine protease associated with MBL (Matsushita and Fujita, 1992). Later on it turned out that the major complement activating protease is MASP2, which can cleave both C4 and C2, while MASP-1 has some activity only on C2, but this is lower than that of MASP-2 (Ambrus et al., 2003). It is not clear what significance the C2-cleaving activity has, since to form the convertase C4b2a, C4 and C2 must be cleaved almost simultaneously, by a protease which is bound to a surface, as is achieved by C1s within a target-bound C1 complex, or by MASP-2 in a target-bound MBL-MASP-2 complex. For MASP-1 to augment the activity of surface-bound MASP-2, MASP-1 would have to be bound to the same target, very close to the MASP-2. The presence of MASP-1 is however reported to enhance signifTable 1 Known protein substrates and inhibitors of MASP-1.

icantly lectin pathway activation (Møller-Kristensen et al., 2006) adding to the effect of MASP-2. Factors in favor of a role for MASP-1 in complement activation are that MASP-1 is present in serum at about 10-fold higher concentration than MASP-2 (Terai et al., 1997; Møller-Kristensen et al., 2003), and it is inactivated at a much lower rate than MASP-2 by serpins. MASP-2 is inhibited by C1-inhibitor very fast (kass 2 × 107 at 37  C, Kerr et al., 2008), while MASP-1 is inhibited by C1-inh (kass 6 × 103 at 25  C) or antithrombin in the presence of heparin (kass 4 × 104 at 25  C) at a moderate rate (Dobó et al., unpublished). However, we should take into account that 2Macroglobulin also significantly inhibited MASP-1 in vitro (Ambrus et al., 2003). Nevertheless while MASP-2 is essential for the lectin pathway activation (Vorup-Jensen et al., 2000), MASP­1 has at best only a supporting role, which implies that it has substrates outside the complement system. Indeed MASP-1 was shown to cleave fibrinogen, and factor XIII (Hajela et al., 2002; Krarup et al., 2008), and recently protease activated receptor 4 (PAR4) on endothelial cells (Megyeri et al., unpublished). These observations, together with the fact that antithrombin in the presence of heparin is the most efficient inhibitor of MASP-1, indicate an analogous role with thrombin and a link between the lectin pathway and coagulation. MASP-2 also has a coagulation protease-like activity, since, as noted above, it can activate prothrombin (Krarup et al., 2007) in vitro. Recently a novel function of MASP-1 was suggested, namely activation of MASP-2 (Takahashi et al., 2008), however it is unclear why the involvement of MASP-1 would be necessary when MASP-2 can autoactivate by itself (Gál et al., 2005). In addition to the above mentioned substrates MASP-1 has been shown to be active on other proteins. It can cleave C3(H2 O) (but not active C3) quite efficiently (Ambrus et al., 2003), it is active on gelatin zymography (Gál et al., 2007) and can even cleave ceruloplasmin (unpublished). Although these reactions are probably not physiologically relevant, they also indicate a relaxed specificity of MASP-1 compared to related enzymes. Taken together these data point out that MASP-1 has an unusually broad specificity among this family of proteases. MASP-1 shares the same domain organization as MASP-2, MASP3, C1r and C1s as discussed before. Interestingly the SP domain of MASP-1 stands out among these enzymes from an evolutionary point of view. The SP domain of MASP-1 is encoded by six exons, as opposed to one, it has more disulfide bridges, as the other proteases lack the so-called histidine loop, and finally the active Ser residue is encoded by a TCN codon, as opposed to a AGY codon (Endo et al., 1998; Krem and Di Cera, 2001). These markers place the MASP-1 SP domain somewhere between thrombin and trypsin, and much further from the SP domain of C1r, C1s, and MASP-2 from an evolutionary point of view. It is intriguing that the evolutionary differences are indeed reflected in the structure. Recently the structure of MASP­1 CCP1-CCP2-SP was solved (Dobó et al., 2008a,b). Structural comparison of the SP domains revealed that the substrate binding groove of MASP-1 is wide and easily accessible, and in this respect it is more reminiscent of trypsin rather than proteases

with the same domain organization. This property explains why so many protein substrates of MASP1 have been found, whereas typical complement proteases have only a few (typically 1­3) targets. Just as an example C1r can autoactivate (self-cleavage) and cleave C1s, whereas MASP-1 is able to autoactivate, cleave C2, factor XIII, fibrinogen, PAR4, C3(H2 O), and possibly other targets (Table 1). Overall MASP-1 can be considered as a relatively unspecific SP domain joined to five regulatory domains. However the structure revealed some features that counteract this promiscuous behavior. The aspartate residue at the bottom of the S1 substrate specificity pocket (Asp189 using chymotrypsin numbering) is in an ion-pair with a side chain arginine (Arg224, chymotrypsin numbering). The ion pair probably modulates the activity of MASP-1 making it a less active protease. Interestingly a similar ion-pair is found in factor D, the initiating protease of the alternative pathway (Narayana et al., 1994). The arginine side chain involved (Arg218) in factor D is in the vicinity, but in a different position compared to MASP-1, and it completely blocks access to the S1 pocket. In factor D major rearrangement of region is needed to make the S1 site accessible for the substrate, in MASP-1 however rotation of a few side chains is sufficient possibly induced by substrate binding. So the function of the Asp189­Arg224 salt bridge in MASP-1 is likely to reduce but not to prevent its reactivity. Another feature of the structure is the presence of a relatively long loop B (Perona and Craik, 1997), which is also called the 60-loop. This loop is a major specificity determinant in thrombin (Bode et al., 1989). Interestingly in MASP-1 loop B is even longer than the one in thrombin suggesting a role in substrate recognition. MASP-1 has several substrates outside the complement system. This promiscuous behavior is unusual among complement proteases. The crystal structure of MASP-1 helped to explain the background of MASP-1's broad specificity. The lectin pathway of complement has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of IR injury. Though the major target of drug design is MASP-2 in this field, the involvement of MASP-1 cannot be excluded, hence design of specific inhibitors for MASP-1 are also desired, which is aided by the structure. The recent finding that MASP-1 activates PAR4 on endothelial cells (Megyeri et al., unpublished) emphasizes the significance of MASP-1, the potential functions of which (localized coagulation, pro-inflammatory effect, complement activation) may serve as concerted means to fight infection. 6. MASP-3, MAp19, and some considerations of the nature of complexes Very little information is available on the enzymatic properties of MASP-3 but it has been found to have some activity towards the synthetic substrates Z-Gly­Arg­S-Bzl, Pro­Phe­Arg­AMC and several other arginine-terminating tripeptide aminomethylcoumarins as well as the protein IGFBP-5 (which is also cleaved by C1s). It does not cleave C2, C4 or C3. It does not appear to autoactivate. MASP-3 is the only protease in the C1r/C1s/MASPs family which is not inhibited by C1-inh. It is also not inhibited by several other plasma serpins, but was inhibited by ecotin, an E. coli-derived protein which is a potent inhibitor of human Factor Xa. (Dahl et al., 2001; Zundel et al., 2004; Cortesio and Jiang, 2006) Thus no role is known for MASP-3 or for its complexes with MBL and ficolins. Similarly, no role is known for MAp19 and its complexes: MAp19 has no SP domain, so no proteolytic activity. It can of course compete with MASP-1, -2 and -3 for occupation of MBL or ficolins, thus inhibiting formation of productive protease complexes. This may be a valid physiological role, but this is difficult to judge, as relative concentrations of MAp19 compared with the MASPs are not accurately known. It would be an effective competitor only if total MASPs + MAp19 concentrations are in excess of all the binding sites

on MBL and ficolins: however as discussed below, this is probably not the case in blood. The N-terminal domains (CUB1-EGF-CUB2) of the C1r/C1s/MASPs family proteins participate in dimerization and complex formation between the dimers and the recognition molecule (C1q, MBL or ficolin). In contrast to C1r and C1s, which form heterotetramers of composition C1r2 s2 , MASPs are now believed to form only homodimeric complexes through their CUB1-EGF domains in a Ca2+ dependent manner (Zundel et al., 2004). When this was investigated further using equilibrium ultracentrifugation and recombinant fragments of the rat MASP-1 and MASP-2 (CUB1-EGF and CUB1-EGF-CUB2, respectively), it was found that only homodimeric complexes were formed (Wallis and Dodd, 2000). Similarly Thielens et al. (2001) found that MAp19 and CUB1-EGF fragments of MASP-1 and -2 also form only homodimers. It was not until 3-dimensional structural data was acquired for C1s CUB1-EGF fragment, MAp19 and the CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domains of MASP-2 and MASP-1/3 that the mechanism behind the dimerization process was elucidated (Feinberg et al., 2003; Gregory et al., 2003, 2004; Teillet et al., 2008). It was found that two monomers interacted in the presence of Ca2+ , through the CUB1-EGF domains in a head-to-tail manner without any apparent involvement of the catalytic domains. However some uncertainty remains: MASP-1 and MASP-3 have identical CUB1-EGF-CUB2 sequences, so do they form heterodimers? These have not so far been reported. The association of the MASP dimers with MBL and the ficolins is also dependent on the N-terminal CUB1-EGF-CUB2 domains. It has been found using human recombinant MASP-1, MASP-2, MASP-3 and their N-terminal domains (CUB1-EGF-CUB2, CUB1-EGF) that all interact individually with immobilized MBL and L-ficolin in the presence of Ca2+ ions (Thielens et al., 2001; Cseh et al., 2002; Zundel et al., 2004). In these studies the association constants for association of any MASP with MBL or L-ficolin were found to be comparable. The overall structure of MBL or ficolin in complex with MASPs is unknown but the stoichiometry of the complexes have been investigated using both surface plasmon resonance and equilibrium ultracentrifugation. In the studies using surface plasmon spectroscopy it was found that one MBL oligomer could associate with one MASP homodimer (Teillet et al., 2005). In the study using equilibrium ultracentrifugation and rat recombinant MBL, MASP-1 and MASP-2 it was found that MBL dimers (i.e. 2 subunits, 6 polypeptide chains) could associate with one MASP homodimer, but MBL tetramers could associate with two. Association with more than one MASP dimer only occurred at MASP concentrations greater than physiological (Chen and Wallis, 2001), so in vivo, it seems likely that each MBL or ficolin molecule will associate with only one homodimer, which may be MASP-1, MASP-2, MASP-3 or MAp19. In the plasma of healthy individuals, there is strong evidence that the concentrations of C1q and C1r2 s2 are balanced, such that there is no excess free C1q, or excess free C1r2 s2 in circulation, even although the proteins are made in different cells (C1r and C1s in hepatocytes, C1q mainly in myeloid cells), so the proteins must associate extracellularly. Concentrations of C1q and of C1r2 s2 are usually assumed to be about 80 g/ml and about 65 g/ml. MBL, ficolins and MASPs, however, are at much lower concentrations, and as discussed by Mayilyan et al. (2006a,b), current estimates of relative concentrations indicate that there are not enough MASPs to occupy all the ficolins and MBL. Thus in addition to MBL-MASP complexes, and ficolin-MASP complexes, free MBL and free ficolins (H and L) are likely to be in circulation. Measurements of MASP-1 associated with MBL, versus MASP-2 associated with MBL show that the concentrations of MBL-MASP-1 and MBL-MASP-2 vary widely between individuals. Thus while there is only one type of C1 complex, which is homogeneous and of uniform composition, MBL-MASPs and ficolin-MASPs complexes may be considered very

heterogeneous, with respect to the population of MBL and ficolins which is occupied by MASP-1, MASP-2, MASP-3, MAp19, or unoccupied. Since some components are made in different tissues, certain complexes may be more abundant and functionally important in local areas ­ e.g. perhaps H-ficolin and MASP-3 in the lungs. The unoccupied MBL or ficolins may act as opsonins: complexes with MASP-2 activate complement and probably localized coagulation, but we do not know exactly what the MASP-1, MASP-3 or MAp19 complexes do. The ability to measure these different complexes separately in clinical samples will become more widespread in the near future, and may provide interesting insights into their different roles and functions in immune defense.
