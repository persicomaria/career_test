The specific association of an SH2 domain with a phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-containing sequence of another protein precipitates a cascade of intracellular molecular interactions (signals) which effect a wide range of intracellular processes. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src, which has been associated with breast cancer and osteoporosis, contains an SH2 domain. Inhibition of Src SH2-phosphoprotein interactions by small molecules will aid biological proof-of-concept studies which may lead to the development of novel therapeutic agents. Structure-based design efforts have focused on reducing the size and charge of Src SH2 ligands while increasing their ability to penetrate cells and reach the intracellular Src SH2 domain target. In this report we describe the synthesis, binding affinity, and Src SH2 cocrystal structure of a small, novel, nonpeptide, urea-containing SH2 domain ligand.
Introduction (Src) protein is a nonreceptor tyrosine The kinase which is characterized by an N-terminal unique domain followed by two Src homology domains, SH3 and SH2, a catalytic kinase (or SH1) domain, and a short C-terminal regulatory peptide segment. SH2 domains consist of approximately 100 amino acids and bind to phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-containing proteins in a sequence dependent manner, while SH3 domains bind to proline-rich sequences in peptides. The association of an SH2 domain with a pTyr-containing sequence of another protein is believed to initiate a complex cascade of intracellular molecular interactions (signals), which effect a wide range of processes including cell growth, proliferation, mitogenisis, and transformation.1-3 Phosphoproteins which have been shown to bind to the Src SH2 domain include middle T antigen, PDGF receptor, EGF receptor, and focal adhesion kinase.4-8 Furthermore, Src has been implicated to play a role in both breast cancer5 and osteopetrosis,9,10 suggesting that Src might be an attractive therapeutic target. We have chosen to focus our drug design efforts on the Src SH2 domain since its three-dimensional structure was the first to be determined by X-ray crystallography and since SH2 domains recognize short synthetic pTyr-containing peptides, in which specificity is conveyed by the residues immediately C-terminal to the pTyr residue.11,12 For Src the optimal binding sequence was found to be -pTyr-Glu-Glu-Ile-. Extensive crystallographic studies have provided a detailed molecular map of both complexed and uncomplexed forms of the Src SH2 protein.13-15 Since that time, the threedimensional structures of numerous SH2 domains have also been solved in both liganded and apo-protein forms by X-ray crystallography and NMR techniques.16 Structurally, all SH2 domains studied thus far are comprised of a central antiparallel -sheet core flanked on each side by an R-helix. In the reported Src structures, as in other SH2 structures, the phosphopeptide ligands bind perpendicular to the -sheet core and interact with

two well-defined pockets, the pTyr (pY) pocket and the hydrophobic binding pocket (pY+3). Using the threedimensional X-ray structure of Src SH2 domain complexed to the 11-mer phosphopeptide, Glu-Pro-Gln-pTyrGlu-Glu-Ile-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Leu, a structure-based design approach has been employed to discover small molecule Src SH2 ligands. The first reported efforts reduced the 11-mer peptide to a potent pentapeptide,17 and then later to a homologated D-amino acid containing tripeptide.18 Previously, we have communicated our design of a series of D-amino acid containing tripeptide ligands,19 a series of dipeptide ligands,20 and our efforts to modify the pTyr residue.21,22 Our motivation for reducing the size, charge, and peptide character of these ligands, while maintaining the potency, is derived from the fact that SH2 domains are intracellular targets requiring the ligands to penetrate cell membranes. Ultimately, inhibition of SH2phosphoprotein interactions by such small molecules will aid biological proof-of-concept studies which may lead to the development of novel therapeutic agents designed to attenuate Src SH2 specific signal transduction pathways. In this paper, we describe the synthesis, binding affinity, and Src SH2 cocrystal structure of a novel nonpeptide, urea-containing ligand for the Src SH2 domain. Chemistry The known pentapeptide,17 1, was synthesized using solid-phase methodology based on an Fmoc/tert-butyl protection strategy.23 The resin for the synthesis of 1 was split prior to the incorporation of the final tyrosine residue, allowing incorporation of tyrosine mimic, 8, to yield compound 2. The tyrosine mimic (R)-2-(p-hydroxybenzyl) succinic acid, 8, was synthesized by adapting the known Evans methodology-based synthesis of the related phenylalanine mimic.24 The synthesis of tripeptide 3, dipeptide 4, and the protected amine 9, used in the synthesis of Src SH2 ligands 5 and 6, has been previously reported.20 The intermediate 9 was deprotected providing the amine 10 which was employed, without purification, in conjunction with N-(p© 1997 American Chemical Society

Purification of the crude phosphorylated Src SH2 ligand was accomplished by reversed phase preparative HPLC providing 5, 6, and 7. Results and Discussion Design Strategy. Recently, we have demonstrated the cellular delivery of a series of dipeptide Src SH2 ligands.26 This was accomplished by replacement of the phosphate group of pTyr, which is expected to be dephosphorylated by nonspecific phosphatases inside cells, by the nonhydrolyzable 4-(phosphonodifluoromethyl)phenylalanine (F2Pmp) group.27,28 The F2Pmp group, which is also dianionic at physiological pH, is then masked as the (acyloxy)methyl ester to provide prodrugs which both penetrate cells and are readily reconverted to the parent Src SH2 ligands inside the cell. Further development of small effective Src SH2 ligands, which both penetrate cells and provide insight into the therapeutic potential of blocking SH2 domainphosphoprotein interactions, may hinge on discovering simplified pTyr replacements which ideally would be uncharged and achiral. To this end we synthesized a number of Ac-pTyr analogues21,22 and incorporated them into the pTyr-Glu-Glu-Ile-Glu sequence for convenient comparison to previously studied phosphate replacements reported by Glaxo researchers.17 The most potent Ac-Tyr mimic, 8, was obtained by replacing the acetamide group with an R-carboxymethyl group providing analogue 2 which was equipotent with the parent compound, 1, Ac-pTyr-Glu-Glu-Ile-Glu (Table 1). Molecular modeling of 2 suggests that potency is retained due to the N-terminal carboxy group forming a bifurcated hydrogen bond to the side chain of Arg 12 just as the acetamide group does in the pentapeptide, 1, complex.17 A similar hydrogen bond was seen in the X-ray structure of the D-amino acid containing tripeptide 3 complexed to Src SH2.32 Rather than incorporating the (R)-(p-hydroxybenzyl) succinic acid, 8, Tyr mimic used in peptide 2 into our dipeptide series of compounds, simplification by removing the chiral center appeared advantageous since the achiral N-(p-hydroxybenzyl)glycine analogue was readily

Hydrogenolysis of the benzyl protecting group in 14 gives the phenol 15 (Scheme 1). The naphthylurea-containing Src SH2 ligand, 7, (Scheme 2) was synthesized by first reacting Glu(OtBu)-OMe in dichloromethane and excess pyridine with phosgene in toluene to form the isocyanate, which was subsequently coupled with 1-amino-6naphthol to give urea 18. The methyl ester of 18 was hydrolyzed, and the resulting acid, 19, was coupled with methyl (3-cyclohexylpropyl)amine to provide urea 20. The phenol functionality in 13, 15, and 20 was phosphorylated by employing di-tert-butyl diethylphosphoramidite and tetrazole (Schemes 1 and 2). The phosphitylated phenol was directly oxidized in situ with tertbutyl hydroperoxide, providing the protected phosphates 16, 17, and 21, which could be isolated but were typic-

synthesized.30,31 The protected achiral Tyr mimetic 11 was substituted for the Ac-Tyr group in dipeptide 4 (IC50 ) 0.8 µM) to provide 5 (IC50 ) 7.0 µM) resulting in about a 10-fold loss of potency (Table 1). Initially, this drop in potency was hypothetically attributed to the achiral sp2-hybridized urea linkage causing a ligand conformation unfavorable for optimal binding. Structurally, loss of the sp3 hybridized chiral center could cause the phosphate group to be poorly positioned in the pY pocket. Alternatively, the urea linkage could cause the Nterminal carboxy group to be outside hydrogen bonding distance with the Arg 12 side chain. Modeling predicted that the carboxy group of 5 was capable of forming a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the Arg 12 side chain while the phosphophenyl group occupied the pY pocket. However, other interactions might be compromised. To directly evaluate the role of the carboxy group in ligand binding, the Tyr mimic 11 was further simplified to p-hydroxybenzylamine providing the nonpeptide Src SH2 ligand 6 (Table 1). Importantly, 6 (IC50 ) 12 µM), which lacks the carboxymethyl group of 5, is only about 2-fold less potent than 5. This suggests that the loss of binding affinity of 5 and 6 relative to dipeptide 4 is likely

attributable not only to a conformational effect induced by the achiral urea on the position of the phenyl phosphate group but also to a diminished interaction of the carboxy group of 5 with Arg 12san interaction not possible with 6 which lacks the carboxy group. To explore the effect of restricting the conformational freedom of the p-hydroxybenzylamine derived portion of 6, 1-amino-6-naphthol was employed next as a Tyr mimic (Table 1). This modification, in conjunction with the urea linkage, restricts rotational freedom of ligand 7 from the glutamic acid NH through to the phosphate group (as compared to the Ac-pTyr dipeptide analogue 4). Nonpeptide 7 (IC50 ) 13 µM) is equipotent with 6, demonstrating that the increased size and decreased rotational freedom imposed by the naphthol-based Tyr mimic is accommodated by the phosphate binding pocket of Src SH2. These results also suggest that this pocket is somewhat adaptable. The approximate 10fold difference in binding affinity between 4 and nonpeptides 5, 6, and 7, which contain a diverse set of AcTyr mimics, may be partially attributed to diminished hydrogen-bonding interactions of these Tyr mimics, relative to Ac-Tyr, with the Arg 12 side chain.

with a somewhat adaptable pTyr binding pocket, poor positioning of the phosphate in the binding pocket could also play a role in the diminished binding affinity. Crystal Structure of Urea 5. To gain an understanding of the nature of the interactions between the SH2 domain and the nonpeptide ligands 5 and 6, cocrystallization experiments were conducted. A crystal structure of 5 complexed with Src SH2 was determined. An initial Fo - Fc residual map, phased on the molecular replacement solution without ligand, shows the urea compound 5 in good detail (Figure 1). The overall structure of the SH2 domain in the complex is very similar to that previously described,13,14,17 and the quality for the final 2.4 Å 2Fo - Fc map is excellent, as it fully describes both the protein and ligand (Figure 2). Src SH2 residues 107-112 are disordered according to the electron density map and are therefore not included in the final model. The X-ray results do reveal, however, a unique ligand binding mode which is different than that previously reported for Src SH2 peptide ligands, including the dipeptide 432 and the tripeptide 3.32 Although ligand 5 binds with the phosphate group in the pY pocket and the cyclohexyl group in the hydrophobic pY + 3 pocket, as expected, the conformation of the ligand is quite different than initial predictions (Figure 1). In particular, the orientation of the phenyl phosphate ring in the pY pocket is nearly perpendicular to that exhibited by tyrosine-containing peptide ligands, although the phosphate group is centered within 1 Å of that observed for the peptide ligands. Also, as if to avoid a steric clash with the phenyl phosphate ring, the guanadinium of Arg 12 moves away from the pY pocket by several angstroms and, as a result, is not able to form the expected hydrogen bond with the ligand N-terminal carboxymethyl group, leaving it completely exposed to solvent. The side

chain of Lys 60 also moves to accommodate the difference in phosphophenyl binding. Most surprising is the existence of a cis-amide linkage between the pY + 1 Glu and the C-terminal methyl (3cyclohexyl propyl) amine group with respect to dipeptide 432 which has this group trans-oriented. As a result of this unexpected configuration, the structural water molecule (shown as sphere in Figure 1), which usually mediates a hydrogen bond between the Lys 60 backbone and the pY + 1 ligand carbonyl of more peptidic Src SH2 ligands,13,14,17 is displaced by the cis-amide carbonyl oxygen to provide a new direct protein-ligand contact. The hydrogen bond between His 58 carbonyl and the pY + 1 Glu NH observed in all other reported peptide complexes is preserved in the ureido complex, as is the solvent-exposed environment of the pY + 1 Glu side chain. The C-terminal cyclohexyl ring of 5, however, does not bind as deeply into the pY + 3 pocket as does the preferred Ile residue of the high affinity pY-E-EI-E sequence, but more deeply than the cyclohexyl group of the tripeptide 3. Figure 3 shows the hydrogen bond and van der Waals contacts made by the urea ligand with the Src SH2 domain. In spite of the unique binding mode for the phenyl phosphate group within the pY pocket, the phosphate moiety assumes the same position, but has a different relative orientation, when compared with the phosphate of other Src SH2 ligand complexes (Figure 1). The same pY pocket side chains are involved in the hydrogen-bonding scheme of the phosphate with the exception of Cys 42 and Lys 60, each of which makes contact with a phosphate oxygen in the urea complex, but not in other peptide complexes. However, Arg 12 does not make a hydrogen bond with the phosphate of the urea ligand while Arg 12 does in other crystal complexes reported.

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1997, Vol. 40, No. 23 3723 SH2 fusion protein was performed in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% NP-40. Assay additions to a Millipore filter plate (0.45 mM PVDF) resulted in v-Src SH2 fusion protein-glutathione sepharose bead complex, 2.8 nm [125I]phosphopeptide and 2% DMSO + test compound at different concentrations. Binding was performed at room temperature for 20 min while continuously inverting the plate. Unbound [125I]phosphopeptide was separated from SH2-bound radiolabeled peptide by vacuum filtration and washing two times with 100 µL per well of assay buffer. Results are expressed as IC50 values and are averages of at least two duplicate determinations. X-ray Methods. As described,29 our v-Src SH2 domain was expressed in E. coli as a 112-amino acid protein and stored as an ammonium sulfate precipitate slurry (70%). A sample of the slurry was dialyzed against 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, HCl, pH 7, and concentrated to 30 mg/mL. The complex of Src SH2 with the urea compound 5 was crystallized at room temperature by vapor diffusion in a hanging drop consisting of mother liquor, protein, and 4 mg/mL ligand in a 4:4:2 ratio, with the mother liquor being 20% PEG 6000 and 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6. Hexagonal rods (0.35 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm) appeared within a week. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a MarResearch image plate, mounted on a Rigaku 200B rotating anode generator (operating at 40 kV and 120 mA) and a graphite monochromator. The data were processed using the XDS package33 to determine the space group as P61 with one molecule in the unit cell and cell dimensions a ) b ) 74.4 Å, c ) 38.8 Å (VM ) 2.2 Å3/Da). Using a detector distance of 100 mm and 1200 s/frame exposures, 95.5% of data 2.4-20.0 Å was collected (4692 unique reflections) with an R-merge of 10.5% and a multiplicity of four. The crystal structure of the complex was determined by AmoRe molecular replacement methods34 using 3.5-10 Å data and the Src SH2 molecule in complex with the 11-mer phosphopeptide13 as a search model. The search model did not contain the phosphopeptide or the water molecules. The unambiguous molecular replacement solution gave a correlation coefficient of 60.5% and an R factor of 36.2%. An initial 2.4 Å Fo - Fc electron density map, phased on the molecular replacement solution, confirmed the correct solution had been found since density in the binding site closely resembled the urea compound 5. The structure was refined at 2.4 Å resolution using conventional refinement (positional and independent B factor) in XPLOR35 and manual model building was performed in QUANTA36 on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 workstation. Waters were added to the model as the quality of the maps allowed. The final R factor was 20% with 67 water molecules. Overall deviations from ideal geometry for bonds, angles, planes, and impropers were 0.014 Å, 2.9°, 2.9°, and 28.6°, respectively. The coordinates for the complex have been deposited in Brookhaven DataBank. Chemistry. General. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on either a Varian XL300 or Unity 400 spectrometers in DMSOd6 (DMSO) unless otherwise indicated. 31P NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Unity 400 spectrometer using a 5 mm Nalorac Quad probe. Spectra were obtained at 293 K, and phosphorus chemical shifts are referenced to external H3PO4 in CDCl3 at 0.0 ppm. Chemical ionization mass spectra were recorded on a Fisons (VG Biotech) Trio-2A using 1% ammonia in methane as the reagent gas. Electrospray and APCI mass spectra were obtained on a single quadrapole instrument (VG Fisons Trio 2000). Flash silica gel chromatography was performed using Keiselgel 230-400 mesh. Analytical HPLC chromatograms were obtained using a C18 analytical column (Vydac, 4.6 × 250 mm), eluting with a linear gradient of 0-66% acetonitrile containing 0.1% TFA and water containing 0.1% TFA over 22 min unless otherwise indicated, and the peaks were detected at 214 nm. Thin-layer chromatography employed EM Science silica gel 60 F254 glass backed plates. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried over sodium-benzophenone ketyl and distilled. All other commercially available solvents and reagents were used without further purification.

Conclusions On the basis of the structural information provided by the X-ray analysis of the complex, the 10-fold difference is potency between ligands 4 and 5 can probably be attributed to several factors: (1) the lack of interaction between the SH2 Arg 12 side chain and both the N-terminal carboxy moiety and the phosphate group of the ligand 5, (2) the difference in the phosphate binding pattern in the pY pocket, and (3) the displacement of the structural water of the peptide complexes with the cis-amide carbonyl. In spite of the decrease in potency, we have successfully designed a series of nonpeptide Src SH2 ligands which contain simplified Tyr mimics. The design was based on modeling of dipeptide 4 in the context of the tripeptide 3 crystal complex. These mimics may aid in the discovery of small effective Src SH2 ligands, which penetrate cells and block Src SH2-phosphoprotein interactions. The crystal structure of 5 complexed with Src SH2 domain reveals some important and unique binding interactions not observed in the complex with tripeptide 3. Both the orthogonally orientated phenyl phosphate group in the pY pocket and the unique conformation of the solventreplacing cis-amide backbone suggest that a potent nonpeptide Src SH2 ligand need not be strictly modeled after the conventional peptide binding mode. An understanding of these differences may enable us to design more potent and further simplified Src SH2 ligands. Experimental Section
