Abstract

Fumagillin is a potent anti-angiogenic drug used in cancer treatments. It is also one of the few molecules active against the Enterocytozoon and Encephalitozoon parasites responsible for various clinical syndromes in HIV-infected or immunosuppressive treated patients. Its toxicity, however, makes desirable the design of more specific molecules. The fumagillin target, as anti-angiogenic agent, is the methionine aminopeptidase, an ubiquitous metallo-enzyme responsible for the removing of the N-terminal methionine in nascent proteins. By analogy, it has been proposed that this enzyme could also be the target in the parasites. As a first approach to verify this and to determine if it would be possible to design a more specific derivative, we have built a homology model of the E. cuniculi aminopeptidase. The charges of the two cobalt ions present in the active site and of the side-chains involved in their binding were computed using ab-initio methods. A preliminary comparison of the interactions of the fumagillin and of a related compound, the TNP-470, with both the human and the parasitic enzymes strongly support the hypothesis that the parasitic aminopeptidase is indeed the target of the fumagillin. It also suggests that the TNP-470 interact identically with both enzymes while there could be small differences in case of the fumagillin. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites of mammals, including human w1x. Those parasites are responsible for various digestive and nervous clinical syndromes in HIV-infected or immunosupressive treated patients w2x. Microsporidiosis cases have been also detected in immunocompetent patients w3,4x and the estimate of the prevalence in the European population is approximately 8% w5x. Species involved in human diseases are mainly Enterocytozoon bieneusi and those of the Encephalitozoon genus (E. cuniculi, E. Hellem, E. intestinalis). Only a few drugs were found to be effective against these microorganisms, the albendazol w6x the fumagillin w7x and several of its derivatives. Albendazol is a broad-spectrum anti-protozoal and anti-helminthic compound, which acts by inhibiting the microtubule polymerization. However, it is not very effective on E. bieneusi and on Encephalitozoon species and may lead to relapse w8x or incomplete response w9x. Fumagillin is an antiamebiasis drug and an inhibitor of tumor-induced angiogenesis. Unfortunately, it is a highly toxic compound. Its synthetic analogue TNP-470 (Owchloroacetylcarbamoylxfumagillol) seems to be a more promising molecule, being less toxic and 50 times more active against tumors w10x. However, its potentialities as an anti-parasitic drug have not been really evaluated and the long-term consequences of a prolonged exposition are not clear, considering, in particular, its potent anti-angiogenic activity w10x. Moreover, while the mammalian molecular target of TNP-470 and fumagillin has been identified as the methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP-2: EC 3.4.11.18) w11x, the parasitic target is not known. Based on the recent identification of a gene product homologous to MetAP-2 in the E. cuniculi genome w12x, we wondered if this protein could be the microsporidial target of TNP-470 and fumagillin. We were also interested in exploring the feasibility of designing new fumagillin derivatives, which could be more specific of the parasitic enzyme. The computational approach will certainly not be sufficient to give an answer to these questions, but has proven to be very helpful to orient the

experimental research w13,14x. A pre-requisite to approach these problems is to have a precise description of the protein structure and of its interactions with the drugs. The three-dimensional structures of the human aminopeptidase complexed with both the fumagillin and the TNP-470 have been reported w15x, but the structure of the parasitic enzyme remains unknown. In addition, methionine aminopeptidases are metallo-enzymes. They possess two cobalt ions in their active site. The correct description of the electrostatic interactions between the enzymes and their inhibitors requires the calculation of the charges carried by the cobalt ions and by the residues involved in their chelation. In this paper, we report the homology modeling of the E. cuniculi aminopeptidase three-dimensional structure and the calculation of the charges carried by the different elements involved in the cobalt cluster. This was used to obtain a preliminary comparison of the possible interactions between the drugs and both the human and the parasitic enzymes. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Soft- and hardware The MODELLER w16x, PROCHECK-NMR w17x and X-PLOR w18x softwares were implemented on either a Linux Personal Computer or a SUN Sparc20 workstation. The GAUSSIAN 98 w19x software runs on a DEC workstation. Graphical analyses of the structures were performed with MOLMOL w20x running on Linux or INDY SiliconGraphics workstations. 2.2. Model building The open reading frame encoding the E. cuniculi MetAP-2 is located on the chromosome X (EMBL accession number: AL590449, w12x) from nucleotide 102630 to 103703 (gene number 10_0750). All methionine aminopeptidase structures were downloaded form the RCBS (www.rcsb.orgypdby) server. As explained in the Results section, three of them, namely the human enzyme 1B6A w15x, the Escherichia coli homolog 1C24 w21x and the Pyrococcus furiosus protein 1XGS w22x were

retained for model building. They were aligned using the ALIGN3D routine of MODELLER. The alignment was further refined by visual inspection and by comparing the residue-by-residue Ramachandran plots calculated with PROCHECK-NMR. The E. cuniculi sequence was manually aligned with those of the three known structures. Two families of height models were then calculated using the standard MODELLER procedure. Their quality was verified by PROCHECK-NMR. 2.3. Charges calculation Charge calculations were performed with the GAUSSIAN 98 suite of programs. Geometry optimizations of fumagillin and TNP470 were achieved at the Hartree-Fock (HF) level of theory using the 6-31G* basis set for all atoms (H, C, O, Cl). Vibrational frequencies of the stationary points were calculated at HFy6-31G* with numerical second derivatives of the energy with respect to the coordinates. The optimized structures were found to be located at minimum on their potential-energy surfaces. The charges of the cobalt cluster were determined using the coordinates of both the 1BOA and 1B6A PDB files w15x. In each case, the two cobalt ions, the side-chains of the Asp251, Asp262, His331 (truncated at the Ca position) Glu364 and Glu459 (truncated at the Cb position), and a water molecule (HOH698 in the case of 1B6A, HOH662 in the case of 1BOA) were introduced in the model. A single point calculation was carried at the B3LYP level of theory, which consists of a hybrid BeckeqHartree-Fock exchange and LeeYang-Par correlation functional with non-local corrections w23x. A relativistic effective core potential (ECP) of Way and Wadt with a (421y211y41) split-valence basis set was used for the cobalt w24x while the 6-31G* basis set was used for the other (H, N, C, O) atoms. The bonding situations of the experimental structures were analyzed using the natural bond orbital (NBO) method developed by Weinhold w25x. 2.4. Inhibitor force field derivation A force field was derived for the fumagillin and the TNP-470. A complete list of bond, angle,

dihedral and improper terms was generated for each molecule by X-PLOR. The reference bond length and angle, dihedral and improper values were derived from the gaussian optimized geometries. A set of force strength constant was first derived by using the `parameter learn' and `parameter reduce' procedures of X-PLOR. This set was completed by using values found for similar terms in the CHARMM22 parameter file. 2.5. Docking and interaction analysis Two of the modeled structures were conserved to analyze the interactions. They were superimposed with either the 1B6A or the 1BOA structures and the coordinates of the cobalt ions and of the corresponding inhibitors were transferred from the PDB to the model files. All protons were then built using the X-PLOR `hbuild' command. The addition of the protons in both the initial crystallographic and the modeled structures results in many bad contacts, which were suppressed by minimization. A strong harmonic potential (1000 ° kcal moly1 Ay1) was applied to avoid too large deformation of the structures in the first step of the process. This restraint was gradually released. At the end, a last minimization was performed without restraint on protein atoms. However, a ° small value (50 kcal moly1 Ay1) was conserved to maintain the positions of the ions, of the residues bound to them, of the inhibitor atoms, and of the water molecule. The electrostatic potential was calculated at the protein surface using the CalcProt command of the MOLMOL software. The solvent and protein dielectric constant were set to 80 and 2, respectively. A salt concentration of 0.3 mol ly1 was used. The AtomCharge file was modified in order to take account of all atom charges, including those calculated for the cobalt cluster. 3.

of the N-terminal methionine from the nascent proteins. The analysis of their sequences suggests that they all are evolutionary related. This is confirmed by the comparison of the three-dimensional structures of the E. coli, human and P. furiosus enzymes. As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, they possess the same `pita-bread' fold w26x formed of two repetitions of an aqb motif (two helices, at least three b-strands). In addition, a small triplestrand b-sheet made from two hairpin loops coming from the two halves of the pita-bread fold is always present. The examination of the Fig. 1, drawn from the indications provided by the PDB file headers, may suggest existence of significant variations of this core-motif (for example: in the number of strands involved in the b-sheets). However, this is only due to differences in the secondary structure element declaration, the direct observation of the three structures indicating a strict conservation of the topology (Fig. 3). The presence of several variable elements beside this conserved core has led to a classification of these enzymes in two main groups. The major difference between class I (formed by the bacterial and several eukaryotic enzymes) and class II (archebacterial and other eukaryotic enzymes) is the presence of a 60 amino acid a y b subdomain inserted within the triple-strand b-sheet in the latter. In addition, eukaryotic class II enzymes possess a small hairpin inserted in the second half of the pita-bread fold (between the second helix and the first b-strand). Finally, they were also characterized by the presence of an additional Nterminal domain. The active site is mainly composed of residues belonging to the two b-sheets of the pita-bread fold and to the triple-strand extension. It is located in the crevasse between the fold and the supple-

mentary a y b domain in the class II enzymes. Five residues (Asp251, Asp262, His331, Glu364 and Glu459, using the human enzyme numbering) are involved in the chelation of two metal ions (two cobalt ions in the crystal), forming a binuclear cluster. Two additional histidines (His231 and His339) are thought to participate to the reaction. Finally, several side-chains are involved in the substrate recognition, Phe219, His331, Ile338, His339 and Tyr444 forming the putative methionine-binding pocket, for example w27x. 3.1.2. Choice of the reference structures The E. cuniculi aminopeptidase is a group II eukaryotic enzyme, and thus we could have modeled its structure using that of the human aminopeptidase alone. However, we preferred to use a more conservative strategy and to keep more than one template. Indeed, we considered that a model is not an experimental structure and is bound to contain incorrect regions, even when the sequences are conserved. In these conditions we preferred to work with an under-determined model than to attempt to draw conclusions from an over-determined one. We chose the MODELLER software for the same reason, as it can take into account the structural and sequence variability of the templates and generate a family of models instead of a single one, allowing the direct observation of the well and the less-well predicted regions. Several structures were available for each of the three structurally studied aminopeptidases: nine for the E. coli enzyme (PDB entries 1C21, 1C22, 1C23, 1C24, 1C27, 1MAT, 2MAT, 3MAT and 4MAT), four for the human (1B6A, 1BOA, 1BN5 and 1B59) and three for the P. furiosus (1XGM, 1XGO and 1XGS). The cobalt ions are absent or localized outside the active site of the 1MAT,

The diagrams have been drawn using the indications reported in the PDB headers. These indications suggest that some b-strands are not conserved (the V76-C78, V223-T225 and T214-T216 strands of the E. coli enzyme, for example). This, however, is refuted by the visual inspection of the three structures. The core domain is, indeed, very similar in the three proteins. It is mainly composed of a pita-bread fold, (best represented in A by the T7-T241 region) and of a triple-stranded b-sheet (N208S231 and I73-I93 region, also in A) The main difference between the E. coli (class I) and the two other (class II) structures is the insertion of an ayb (I205-G264 in B) at the apex of one of the loops forming the triple-strand region. Among the class II enzymes, it is possible to further discriminate the eukariotic and archebacterial structures, the former possessing a small b-hairpin (E312Q321 in C) inserted between the second helix and the first strand of the second half of the pita-bread fold.

3MAT 4MAT and 1XGO structures. They were thus discarded. A visual analysis of the others showed that all structures corresponding to the same protein are nearly identical. The root mean square deviation (rmsd) calculated on the back° bone atoms are 0.2, 0.2 and 0.4 A for the E. coli, human and P. furiosus proteins, respectively. Things become more complicated when considering the side-chains, as several of them are disordered (21 side-chains are missing in, at least, the C2 files, 12 being absent in all of them). However, the rmsd calculated on all conserved heavy atoms ° remain low: 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 A. Considering this, we decided to retain the best structure for each protein, namely the 1C24 (res° ° olution: 1.70 A), the 1B6A (1.60 A) and the ° 1XGS (1.75 A) for the E. coli, human and P. furiosus aminopeptidase, respectively. 3.1.3. Structural and sequence alignment We first aligned the two class II (1B6A and 1XGS) structures using the ALIGN3D routine of the MODELLER software. They appear very similar: the positions of 282 residues are conserved, with a global rmsd calculated on the backbone ° atoms equal to 1.3 A. The main differences concern the replacement of the Ile208-Ala215 loop in the eukaryotic structure by the longer Glu43Asn53 loop in the archebacterial protein and the insertion of the Glu312-Gln321 hairpin between the second helix and the first strand of the second half of the pita-bread fold in the eukaryotic protein. The small a y b inserted domain also appears more variable than the remaining of the structure. Similarly, we also used MODELLER to superimpose the three 1B6A, 1XGS and 1C24 structures. This structural alignment was refined both by visual inspection and by comparing the aminoacid-by-amino-acid Ramachandran plots calculated with PROCHECK-NMR for each structure. These plots were in particular very useful to precisely determine the end of the conserved fragments and

to verify the alignment of the amino acids having an aL conformation. The conserved segments concern less residues (217 instead of 282), but this is mainly due to the absence of the a y b subdomain in the prokaryotic structure. The only other important difference is the insertion in the E. coli structure of a small a-helical region within the first b-strand of the first aqb motif. But, this insertion has nearly no influence on the geometry of the remaining of the considered b-strand. The E. cuniculi sequence was manually aligned on the three others (Fig. 2). There was nearly no insertion and deletion outside those previously discussed. The identity scores calculated between the E. cuniculi and the E. coli, P. furiosus and human sequence is 20, 38 and 52%, respectively. This score is even higher (58%), if we count the positions conserved between the E. cuniculi sequence and at least one of the three others. The worst score (30%) is obtained within the a y b subdomain. 3.1.4. Comparison of the two families of predicted structures Two series of eight structures were calculated using the two class II enzymes as template for the first and the three available structures for the second. They are presented on Fig. 3. In both cases, the eight structures are very similar as shown by the rmsd calculated on the backbone and heavy atoms. The average rmsd values between all pairs of structures are 0.42"0.09 (backbone) and 1.73"0.08 (heavy atoms) for the first series and 0.33"0.06 (backbone) and 1.64"0.06 (heavy atoms) for the second. The largest variability is observed in the a y b subdomain in both cases, but several short segments are also poorly constrained, such as the Gly73-Ile77 or the Asn186-Asp188 regions. The two families are very similar. The rmsd, calculated as previously, are 0.39"0.09 (backbone) and 1.70"0.10 (heavy atoms). However,

The alignment of the 1c24, 1b6a and 1xgs sequences was derived from the structure superimposition, as explained in Material and methods. The b-sheet and a-helix, as defined in the PDB file headers, are delineated by simple and double boxes, respectively. The structurally conserved regions are indicated by an `f' under the sequences. The target sequence was manually aligned. The aminoacids shared by the target and, at least, one of the three other sequences are in gray.

Fig. 3. Comparison of the modelized and crystallographic structures. The three template structures are represented in (A) (1C24, E. coli); (B) (1XGS, P. furiosus) and (C) (1XGS, H. sapiens). The two families of model are in D (models calculated by using the 1B6A and 1XGS structures) and in E (models calculated by using the three X-ray structures). The secondary structure elements have been calculated with MOLMOL. Thus, they do not exactly correspond to those presented in the Fig. 1.

several loops, such as the Gly47-Asn50, Glu74Ile77 and Asn185-Asp188 fragments have different conformations in the two families. This indicates that the introduction of the class I enzyme in the calculation has an influence but, this influence is moderate and confined to small regions of the model. 3.1.5. Charge calculation The investigation of the interactions between the different forms of the enzyme and their inhibitors requires a precise representation of the nonbonded, and in particular of the electrostatic, energy term. In case of the inhibitors (fumagillin and TNP-470), we used the natural charges determined after a full optimization of the geometry (Fig. 4). In case of the protein, the simplest solution would have been to use the standard CHARMM22 charges for the residues and to add two 2q charges for the two cobalt ions. However,

the presence of the ions is bound to influence their surrounding, and vice-versa. We thus decided to calculate the charges carried by the two cobalts and by the residues involved in their chelation (including a water molecule). We used two sets of coordinates derived from the 1BOA (aminopeptidase complexed with fumagillin) and 1B6A (aminopeptidase complexed with TNP-470). The side-chains of the Asp251, Asp262 and His331 were truncated at the Cb position, the Ca being replaced by a proton, whereas those of the Glu354 and Glu459 were truncated at the Cg positions. The calculations were performed for both clusters in the absence and in the presence of the cobalt ions. The results are reported in Fig. 5. The charges of the side-chain atoms are very similar in the two clusters. In the absence of the cobalt ions, the difference is smaller than 0.01 for 38 of the 43 atoms, the largest deviation concerning the Asp251 Od2 (0.0185), the His331 Hd1

(0.0155), the Asp262 Od1 and Od2 (0.0130 both) and the water H2 (0.0125). In the presence of the cobalt ions, the difference is smaller than 0.01 for 33 atoms and the largest deviations mainly concern the glutamate carbonyl functions (Glu354 O´1: 0.0315; Glu459 O´1: 0.0455; Glu459 O´2: 0.0345). The results obtained for the cobalt ions themselves are more contrasted. The charges deviate significantly from 2q and are very different for the two ions (approximately 0.7 for one and 1.6 for the other). In addition, they were swapped between the two clusters. The first cobalt has a charge equal to 0.658 in the first cluster and equal to 1.545 in the second, while the second cobalt has a charge equal to 1.646 in the first cluster and equal to 0.700 in the second. The comparison of the cluster structures shows a very nice superimposition of the amino-acid side-chains (rmsd: 0.1 ° A), but also indicates that the ions occupy slightly different positions. They move by approximately ° 0.3 A . The differences between the two clusters thus seem due to very small displacements of the ions. It is likely that they will be averaged by the thermal movements at room temperature. There-

fore, we have decided to use the same charge set for the two clusters, obtained by averaging the two calculated values for each atom (Fig. 6). The comparison of the mean charge sets obtained in the presence and in the absence of the cobalt ions indicates that the ion main effect is to decrease, in algebraic value, the charge of the atom directly bound to it and to increase the charge of all the others. The negative effects are generally small (from y0.014 for the Asp251 Od2 to y 0.044 for the Asp262 Od2), with the exception of the His331 N´2 (y0.235). The positive effects are larger, the greatest value being that of the Asp262 Cg (0.119). We also compared the charge set calculated in the absence of the cobalt ions with that of the CHARMM22 force field. We found a good agreement when looking at the charges carried by the functional groups (carbonyl and imidazol). However, this is no more true when the aliphatic protons and carbons are considered. The mean values of the charges carried by the aspartate Cb and Hb are y0.758 and 0.173 in our calculations, to be compared to y0.280 and 0.009 in CHARMM22. We thought that the truncation at

The first (a) is issued of the 1B6A PDB file (aminopeptidase complexed with fumagillin), the second (b) of the 1BOA file (aminopeptidase complexed with TNP470). The hydrogen positions have been added using the hbuilt routine of the X-PLOR software. The charges have been calculated in the absence (black, upper value) and in the presence (gray, lower value) of the cobalt ion.

For each atom, a correction corresponding to the difference between the mean values calculated in the presence and in the absence of the cobalt ions was added to the CHARMM charge. The upper and middle values are the mean values (" the variation) of the charge calculated in the absence and presence of the ions, respectively. The CHARMM22 value and the applied correction are the lower values.

the Cb or Cg position was likely responsible of this discrepancy. However, a calculation carried out on a fully optimized model of aspartate residue (H3N­CO­Asp­NH3) ruled out this hypothesis. The charges of the Hb (0.225) atoms are very similar to those obtained for the cluster. That carried by the Cb (y0.570) is smaller than in the cluster, but remain higher than in CHARMM22. The simple replacement of the CHARMM22 charges by those obtained in our calculation would, thus, introduce a discontinuity at the truncation position. To avoid this, we decided to use the difference between the charge sets calculated with and without the cobalt ions as a perturbation and to add it to the CHARMM22 charge set (Fig. 6). 3.1.6. Inhibitor docking and interactions analysis As previously discussed, the different models we computed have very similar backbone structures and the main differences are located in regions far from the active site. However, in order to analyze the interactions between the models and the inhibitors, the variability of the side-chain and,

in particular, of those involved in the inhibitor recognition has to be considered. The analysis of the interactions between the fumagillin and the human aminopeptidase w21x reveals that the direct contacts between the protein and the inhibitor essentially involved nine side-chains. The fumagillin is covalently bound to the His231. The hydrophobic substituent of the C4 atom interacts with the Phe219, His331, Ile338, His339 and Tyr444. The C6 side-chain contacts the Leu328 and Leu447 through hydrophobic interactions, and the Asp376 through a hydrogen bond. All these residues are conserved in the E. cuniculi enzyme. The side-chain orientations vary according to the considered model. All orientations, but that of the Ile338, are conserved in the sixth model. Four side-chains possess different orientations in the first (Ile338, Leu328, Tyr444, Asp376), third (Ile338, His339, Tyr444, Asp376) and eighth (Phe219, Leu328, His339, Tyr444) models. We thus decided to dock the fumagillin and the TNP470 inhibitors in both the first and sixth models.

Fig. 7. Representation of the electrostatic field calculated at the surface of the crystallographic 1B6A (A) or of the modelized; (B) structures. The computational and display parameters were the same in both cases. The red and blue colors correspond to positive and negative potential, respectively. The structure of the fumagillin has been represented in green. The cyclic part of the inhibitor is embedded in a deep positive pocket in both cases, while the tail make contacts with the mouth of the pocket, in a region where the potential seems more variable.

The docking was simply realized by coordinate transfer. The conserved regions of the models were superimposed to those of either the 1BOA (with fumagillin) or 1B6A (with TNP-470) structures. The coordinates of the inhibitor, cobalt ions and water molecule were extracted from the PDB files and merged with those of the models. The six complexes (1BOA, 1B6A, model 1 with fumagillin, model 1 with TNP, model 6 with fumagillin and model 6 with TNP) were submitted to the same minimization protocol and the quality of the structures was verified using PROCHECK (Table 1). All non-minimized complexes have a very high energy, due to a large van der Waals contribution (Table 1). This energy become negative in all cases after the minimization, the values being, however, better in case of the two crystallographic structures. This is not unexpected, considering that the side-chain packing in the models is not likely to be optimal. For the same reason, the deformation of the structure during the minimization is larger ° for the models (0.51 A) than for the X-ray struc° but both values are low. A large tures (0.21 A), part of the initial van der Waals energy is due to

bad contacts between the proteins and the inhibitors, the values being, surprisingly, worst for the crystallographic complexes than for the models. The values are very comparable at the end of the minimization with a very small advantage for the complexes involving the sixth model (y42 kcaly moly1 instead of y36 for the first model and y 40 for the X-ray structures). The similarities of the structures after the minimization and of the van der Waals interaction energies indicate that the contacts made by both inhibitors are nearly identical in the crystallographic and in the modeled complexes. This is, indeed, confirmed by the visual inspection of the structures. However, the comparison of the electrostatic energies indicates that there is a small difference between the model and the X-ray structures. The electrostatic interaction between the crystallographic structure and the two inhibitors is always negative (y45 kcal moly1 for the fumagillin, y12 for the TNP), This is also the case for the interaction of the TNP with both the first and the sixth model (y25 and y42 kcal moly1, respectively). However, this energy is positive in case of the fumagillin (29 and 26 kcal moly1). The

inspection of the electrostatic potential map (Fig. 7) allows a rationalization of this observation. The cyclic region of the fumagillin and of the TNP470 interacts with a deep pocket of the enzyme, which strong positive potential seems identical for both the human and the parasitic enzyme. But, the fumagillin possesses, in addition, a long chain interacting with the mouth of the cavity, and the potential of this region seems more variable. In conclusion, the model of the E. cuniculli aminopeptidase suggests that its active site is identical to the human one and that all residues directly involved in the interaction with either the fumagillin or the TNP-470 are structurally conserved. This strongly supports the hypothesis that the E. cuniculli class II aminopeptidase is the target of these two anti-parasitic drugs. The analysis of the electrostatic potential maps also suggests that the human and the parasitic enzymes interact in a similar manner with the TNP-470, but that there may be a slight difference in case of the fumagillin. Accordingly, the synthesis of a more selective inhibitor would require interactions outside the methionine-binding pocket. In addition, we think that the charge set we derived will be useful for further analysis of the E. cuniculli Metaminopeptidase, but also, considering the conservation of the residues involved in the cobalt liganding, of the other members of this enzyme family.
