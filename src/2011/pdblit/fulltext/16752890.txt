ABSTRACT: Chorismate mutase catalyzes the first committed step toward the biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine and tyrosine. While this biosynthetic pathway exists exclusively in the cell cytoplasm, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme has been shown to be secreted into the extracellular medium. The secretory nature of the enzyme and its existence in M. tuberculosis as a duplicated gene are suggestive of its role in host-pathogen interactions. We report here the crystal structure of homodimeric chorismate mutase (Rv1885c) from M. tuberculosis determined at 2.15 Å resolution. The structure suggests possible gene duplication within each subunit of the dimer (residues 35-119 and 130-199) and reveals an interesting proline-rich region on the protein surface (residues 119-130), which might act as a recognition site for protein-protein interactions. The structure also offers an explanation for its regulation by small ligands, such as tryptophan, a feature previously unknown in the prototypical Escherichia coli chorismate mutase. The tryptophan ligand is found to be sandwiched between the two monomers in a dimer contacting residues 66-68. The active site in the "gene-duplicated" monomer is occupied by a sulfate ion and is located in the first half of the polypeptide, unlike in the Saccharomyces cereVisiae (yeast) enzyme, where it is located in the later half. We hypothesize that the M. tuberculosis chorismate mutase might have a role to play in host-pathogen interactions, making it an important target for designing inhibitor molecules against the deadly pathogen.

for multiple enzymes. Various enzymes that utilize chorismate as a substrate include chorismate mutase (CM),1 anthranilate synthase, isochorismate synthase, and p-aminobenzoate synthase. Chorismate mutase (EC, 5.4.99.5), responsible for the production of tyrosine and phenylalanine, catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to prephenate. It is generally agreed that this conversion proceeds via a pericyclic (Claisen-type) rearrangement involving a chairlike transition state (1). CM is one of the rare enzymes catalyzing the pericyclic isomerization of chorismate to prephanate and is

6998 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 23, 2006 involved in the shikimate pathway for biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (2). The enzyme channels chorismate toward the biosynthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine and away from that of tryptophan and therefore represents an important check point for regulating the balance of aromatic amino acids in the cell. Structures of CMs from Escherichia coli (3), Bacillus subtilis (4), Saccharomyces cereVisiae (5-7), and Thermus thermophilus (8) are known. Structural comparisons show that CMs from different organisms have evolved into two completely unrelated protein folds, suggesting separate evolutionary origins of the enzyme. On the basis of the structural fold adopted by the protein, CMs have been classified into the AroH and AroQ classes. Enzymes of the AroH class adopt a trimeric pseudo-R/ -barrel fold and include the monofunctional CMs from B. subtilis and T. thermophilus (4, 8). The AroQ class of enzymes, on the other hand, is completely helical and includes the bifunctional enzymes from E. coli and the monofunctional yeast CM. Intriguingly, despite the different tertiary structures adopted by the proteins in the two CM classes, the mode of substrate recognition in either of them is similar, suggesting a convergence of the catalytic mechanism (9). On the basis of sequence homologies, it has emerged that among the two CM classes, the AroQ CMs are more prevalent in nature and are widely distributed among the prokaryotes. In most prokaryotes, CMs exist as bifunctional enzymes possessing an associated prephenate dehydrogenase or a prephenate dehydratase activity (10). Examples of multiple copies of the CM gene in the same organism are also known, where at least one of the gene products exists as a fusion protein (11). The eukaryotic CMs, on the other hand, are generally monofunctional with the enzyme activity being regulated by the aromatic amino acids (6, 12). Thus, substantial variations exist among the eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes, even within the AroQ class. The crystal structure reported in this paper corresponds to the AroQ class CM of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The availability of the M. tuberculosis genome sequence and its re-annotation later led to the identification of two putative genes, encoded by Rv1885c and Rv0948c open reading frames, encoding the CM enzyme in the organism (13, 14). Although both these proteins have been shown to possess CM activity, the amino acid sequences of the two are less than 15% identical (15, 16). M. tuberculosis CM (MtbCM), encoded by Rv1885c, shares 20% sequence identity with the E. coli enzyme, while the the level of identity with yeast CM is 10%. Despite such a low degree of sequence similarity, however, the Rv1885c gene product has been shown to be a functional enzyme possessing CM activity (15, 16). MtbCM was shown to be monofunctional in nature with no other associated enzyme activity (15). Moreover, unlike the other known prokaryotic CMs, the M. tuberculosis enzyme exhibited allosteric regulation by aromatic amino acids, a feature limited to the eukaryotic CMs (7, 12, 15). Interestingly, CM has been shown to be secreted in many bacteria and nematodes such as Erwinia herbicola, Burkholderia fungorum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Rhodococcus equi, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia pestis, Melidogyne jaVanica, and Heterodera glycines (11, 17-19). Intriguingly, the secreted CMs (designated as *AroQ) from a few of these pathogenic bacteria and the

Accelerated Publications nematodes have been shown to be involved in virulence (1821). Indeed, MtbCM when expressed heterologously in E. coli is found to be localized in the periplasm (15). The secretion of the enzyme has been attributed to the 33 N-terminal residues, deletion of which has been shown to keep the enzyme in the cytoplasm when expressed in E. coli (15). Thus, the existence of MtbCM in the extracellular space suggests that the secreted enzyme might have evolved to play a similar role in M. tuberculosis and aid in its pathogenesis. M. tuberculosis resides inside the macrophages that play an important role in inducing or regulating the innate and T-cell-mediated adaptive immune responses in the host. Given the extracellular existence of MtbCM and the importance of the *AroQ proteins in virulence in other organisms, secretory MtbCM is likely to mediate interactions with the host macrophage cells and play a role in virulence. We have determined the crystal structure of the unique extracytoplasmic MtbCM in complex with its allosteric ligand, Ltryptophan (Trp), at 2.15 Å resolution. The structure reveals an interesting proline-rich fragment on the protein surface. We believe that the proline-rich surface of the protein might be involved in mediating binding of MtbCM to the macrophage cell surface receptor(s). The overall study offers an understanding of the important role of MtbCM in mediating host-pathogen interactions and the mechanisms involved therein. MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization and Data Collection. The M. tuberculosis gene, Rv1885c, encoding CM was expressed in the heterologous host E. coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described previously (22). For production of the selenomethionyl (SeMet) CM, the gene was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) grown in minimal medium, supplemented with the 19 naturally occurring L-amino acids, except methionine, at a concentration of 50 mg/L. Methionine was replaced with seleno-L-methionine at the same concentration, and cells were grown for 16 h after induction with 0.1 mM IPTG at 37 °C. Purification of the Se-Met protein was carried out as described previously (22). Crystals of Se-Met CM were grown by vapor diffusion by equilibrating 3 µL of protein at a concentration of 5 mg/mL against a reservoir containing 0.2 M Li2SO4 and 22% PEG 8000 in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.6) over a period of 4-5 days. The crystallization drop also contained 1 mM tryptophan pre-equilibrated with the protein, which corresponds to an approximately 3.5-fold molar excess of the protein concentration. Crystals were soaked in an artificial mother liquor of the same composition but supplemented with 26% (v/v) glycerol for cryoprotection for 1 min before freezing them for data collection. Data were collected at tunable beam ID-23 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble, France). A fluorescence spectrum was measured around the Se K-absorption edge. Data were measured at the absorption peak ( ) 0.97955 Å;  ) 1°, total ) 180°), inflection point ( ) 0.97975 Å;  ) 1°, total ) 180°), and the low-energy remote point ( ) 0.9809 Å;  ) 1°, total ) 180°) using an ADSC Quantum-4 detector.

son method using RSPS (23), and the two positions that were identified were used as input for SHARP (24). Phases were calculated using SHARP followed by density modification using the solvent flipping option of SHARP. The electron density maps generated with the correct hand were of exceptional quality. A molecular model for 160 residues was constructed using wARPnTRACE (25). The molecular model was refined against the native data collected previously at beam line BL41XU of SPring-8 (22). Refinement was carried out using the target maximum likelihood function as available in REFMAC (26) and CNS (27). Models were built in O (28) by using A-weighted 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps. Structure quality was assessed with PROCHECK (29) and MOLPROBITY (30). Figures were prepared using MOLSCRIPT and RASTER3D (31, 32). Structural superpositions were carried out in O (28) using CR atoms. RESULTS Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement. In an attempt to understand the structural basis of the immunomodulatory nature of MtbCM, the crystal structure of the enzyme was determined. Se-Met MtbCM was crystallized in space group C2 in the presence of Trp. Cell parameters and scaling with the diffraction amplitudes of the native crystals suggested that the Se-Met MtbCM crystals were isomorphous with the native crystals (Table 1). Anomalous Patterson maps led to the identification of two strong peaks corresponding to the Se positions, which were refined using SHARP. The initial map allowed the construction of a molecular model with 160 residues in each chain. Unexpectedly, wARPnTRACE constructed three chains in the asymmetric unit, whereas only two molecules were anticipated from the Matthews coefficient (33). The asymmetric unit therefore contains one and one-half dimers. The final structure contains, in addition to the three polypeptide chains, 218 water molecules. Five sulfate ions were also clearly visible in the A-weighted 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc density

maps and were included in the later parts of the refinement. Moreover, the Fo - Fc difference maps showed large connected density at the >5 level, which water molecules could not account. Since the crystallization buffers contained 1 mM Trp, and the crystals could not be grown in its absence, two Trp molecules were modeled in this density in the later stages of refinement. The Trp ligands were seen to be sandwiched symmetrically between two monomers in a dimer, contacted by residues Pro66, Ile67, and Glu68. The R-factor and Rfree of the final model are 0.180 and 0.224, respectively (Table 2). OVerall Structure of M. tuberculosis Chorismate Mutase. The final refined structure consists of residues 35-199 in three chains designated A-C. We did not observe electron density for the 34 N-terminal residues. These residues are probably disordered or cleaved during heterologous expression in E. coli. It has previously been shown that the recombinant protein when expressed in E. coli is secreted from the cytoplasmic space (15, 16). Secretion of MtbCM is facilitated by the presence of a signal sequence comprising 33 residues at the N-terminus, which is cleaved after secretion (16). The absence of electron density for the first 34 residues at the N-terminus hence might suggest cleavage of the signal peptide from the polypeptide chain prior to crystallizations. The M. tuberculosis enzyme is an all-helical protein, similar to the E. coli and yeast CMs. The polypeptide chain is folded into eight R-helical segments, numbered 1-8 (Figure 1a). Helix 3, spanning residues 90-119, forms the longest helix and is involved in dimerization across the two subunits. This helix also contributes to the allosteric site for the binding of Trp residues involved in enzyme regulation, as discussed below. Helix 7 (residues 159-176) is juxtaposed with respect to helix 8 (residues 179-190) in such a manner

Accelerated Publications Surface area calculations reveal that two of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit bury an area of 1591 Å2, suggesting that these molecules form a biological dimer (Figure 1b). The third molecule in the asymmetric unit forms the biological dimer across the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis. The two dimers are essentially identical in the crystallographically independent subunits, and the subsequent discussion pertains to chains B and C, which are related through noncrystallograpic 2-fold symmetry. Dimerization is mediated through residues spanning helix 3 in both subunits, with the two helices placed antiparallel to one another. A majority of the interactions are mediated by association between side chains of the two adjacent subunits through salt bridges and hydrogen bonding. One of the interactions is formed by an extensive hydrogen bonding network through the guanidino group of Arg103. The guanidino group of Arg103 forms a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Lys117 in the other subunit, and with the side chain amide of Gln190 of the same subunit. Another crucial network brings the side chain carboxyl oxygens of Glu68 and Glu106 into close contact with the N group of Lys117. Moreover, this interaction appears to be crucial in relaying the allosteric effects of Trp, since the Trp forms a hydrogen bonding network (TrpTyr110-Glu68-Lys117-Glu106), whereas Glu106 is a part of the active site (Figures 3 and 4). Thus, intimate side chain-side chain and side chain-main chain interactions contribute to the association of the monomers in the biological dimer. Structural Analysis and Comparison with E. coli CM Suggest Possible Gene Duplication in MtbCM. The MtbCM structure can be thought to consist of two distinct segments, 35-119 and 130-199, as mentioned above. Comparison of the two halves of MtbCM reveals a weak degree of similarity. Superposition between the two halves, i.e., residues 35119 and residues 130-199, yielded a structural alignment with a rmsd of 2.13 Å for 51 CR atoms. Structural similarity between the two halves of MtbCM is therefore suggestive of a possible gene duplication event in MtbCM. The two halves are connected via a highly flexible proline-rich region occurring between helices 3 and 5. This intervening prolinerich loop appears to form an "intergenic" region connecting the gene-duplicated polypeptide of MtbCM. E. coli CM exists as a homodimer with each polypeptide adopting an all-helical fold consisting of three helices in each subunit (3). Sequence comparisons of MtbCM with E. coli CM reveal a low level of pairwise sequence identity of <20%. Moreover, E. coli CM is a small protein of 90 amino acids, while MtbCM is larger and consists of 199 amino acid residues. Despite these differences, however, structural comparisons of MtbCM with the E. coli monomer yield a superposition with a rmsd of 1.97 Å for 78 CR positions (Figure 2a). This superposition aligns helices 1-3 of E. coli CM with helices 1-3 of MtbCM. Moreover, the same rigid body transformation also aligns the second monomer of E. coli CM with helices 5, 7, and 8 of MtbCM. Thus, a single polypeptide chain of MtbCM can simultaneously be superimposed onto both chains of the E. coli CM dimer. Such a superposition results in an overall rmsd of 1.42 Å for 117 CR atoms. Since the two halves of MtbCM are structurally homologous to each other and both halves can be simultaneously superimposed with the E. coli CM dimer, MtbCM

that Cys160 forms a disulfide linkage with Cys193 (Figure 1a). Helix 8 leads to a segment of polypeptide, which appears to be an unwound helix, but cannot be classified into a defined secondary structure. Cys193 is placed just after helix 8 in the unwound part of the polypeptide. Formation of the disulfide linkage between Cys160 and Cys193 would not have been possible if the geometry of this stretch was maintained as a typical R-helix. The three polypeptide chains can be superimposed very well with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) between chains A and B of 0.62 Å for 165 CR atoms and between chains A and C of 0.50 Å for 165 CR atoms. The only deviant stretch in the three polypeptide chains is the region spanning residues 119-130. Electron density at the loop region spanning these residues is poorly defined in all the three chains. This region is a proline-rich fragment, which connects two distinct segments of the polypeptide. Thus, despite minor differences in residues 119-130, the overall conformation of the protein is essentially the same in all the three chains. Mode of Dimerization. Size exclusion results have previously shown that MtbCM exists as a dimer (15, 16). Since the crystal asymmetric unit contains three CM molecules, calculation of the buried surface area across different monomers was used to identify the physiological dimer.

7002 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 23, 2006 might indeed be a result of gene duplication. Gene duplication within the MtbCM cannot be discerned by sequence analysis between the two halves of MtbCM, or between the M. tuberculosis and E. coli sequences, but is strikingly evident from comparisons of the two structures. Despite significant similarity between the E. coli and MtbCM structures, the most noticeable deviation occurs in the shortening of helices 1 and 5 of MtbCM, which correspond to helix 1 of both subunits of E. coli CM. These two helices in MtbCM appear to be two-thirds as long as the corresponding helices in the E. coli enzyme. While helix 1 of MtbCM appears to be truncated at the N-terminus, helix 5 is truncated at its C-terminus. Similarly, larger deviations toward the C-terminal region of the polypeptide, such as unwinding of helix 8 of MtbCM, are also observed. Comparison with the Yeast Chorismate Mutase. The level of pairwise sequence identity between the M. tuberculosis and yeast CMs is less than 10%, yet the tertiary structure of the MtbCM superposes well with that of yeast CM, with a rmsd of 1.52 Å for 114 CR atoms. Structural comparisons between yeast CM and MtbCM using CR atoms reveal that the N-terminal half of MtbCM (residues 35-119) superposes very well with the C-terminal half of yeast CM (residues 141-256). This resulting alignment matches helices 1-3 of the M. tuberculosis protein with helices 8, 11, and 12 of yeast CM (Figure 2b). Interestingly, the second half of the M. tuberculosis protein, i.e., helices 5, 7, and 8, aligns well with helices 2, 4, and 7 of yeast CM, respectively. It is interesting to note that the structural alignment matches the C-terminal domain of yeast CM with the N-terminal half of MtbCM and vice versa (Figure 2c). An important difference in the yeast and M. tuberculosis CMs is the mode of dimerization of the two subunits (Figure 2b). The yeast CM exists as a strong dimer that is evident from a large buried surface area of 4078 Å2 between the two monomers. The site of dimerization in yeast CM lies at the interface comprised of helices 2, 4, 8, and 11 and connecting loop regions 50s and 80s (nomenclature as described in ref 7). Dimerization of MtbCM, on the other hand, involves contributions from helix 3 and the loop spanning residues 64-69 and buries a much smaller area of 1591 Å2. Thus, despite similar tertiary structures among the different CMs, the quaternary associations between the individual monomers are very different (Figure 2b). ActiVe Site Residues of MtbCM. The active site of E. coli CM is made up by contributions from both its subunits. On the other hand, the active site in MtbCM lies within each polypeptide chain and is contributed by residues in helices 1-3 and 5. The active site is therefore made up of contributions from both the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the polypeptide. This is very similar to the case for yeast CM where a single polypeptide folds into a functional unit. Since the yeast (7) and M. tuberculosis CMs (this work) are believed to have evolved from duplication of an ancestral CM gene, formation of the active site in a single polypeptide chain appears to be a consequence of this duplication event. Although the overall level of sequence identity among the E. coli, yeast, and M. tuberculosis CM sequences is very low, the structure-guided sequence alignment shows a remarkable conservation of the active site residues in MtbCM (Figure 2c). Of the seven residues contributing to the active site of the AroQ class of CMs, four residues are conserved

FIGURE 3: Comparison of the E. coli and M. tuberculosis CM active sites. Superposition of the E. coli (cyan) and M. tuberculosis (magenta) CMs shows a remarkable conservation of the substrate binding residues. The absence of a crucial glutamate at position 73 in MtbCM is compensated by Glu106, which is now positioned for interaction with the substrate through H-bonding. The endooxabicyclic transition state analogue colored brown is a part of the E. coli CM structure (PDB entry 1ECM).

in MtbCM, while two are conservative replacements, i.e., Ser84Thr and Gln88Glu (numbers corresponding to the E. coli sequence; Figure 2c). The major variation is the replacement of a glutamate, Glu52 in E. coli CM, with a valine, Val73, in MtbCM. Glu52 in E. coli CM has been shown to be crucial, where its side chain carboxyl is important in stabilizing the transition state. The corresponding Glu198 in yeast CM is also crucial for the enzyme activity as demonstrated through site-directed mutagenesis studies (34). Intriguingly, despite this important difference, MtbCM seems to have retained its activity (15, 16). This is most likely due to the presence of Glu106, which occurs at a structurally analogous position, thereby compensating for the loss of a carboxyl group at position 73 (Figure 3). The side chain of Glu106 in MtbCM is appropriately placed to mediate the necessary interactions with the substrate. Therefore, despite the alteration at a crucial residue in MtbCM, the active site geometry is maintained by a compensating mutation. Another residue that has been shown to play an important role in CM catalysis is Glu109 (Gln88 in E. coli and Glu246 in yeast). This glutamate is involved in interactions with the ether O of the substrate and thereby has been shown to restrict the enzyme activity to acidic pH (34). Comparison of enzyme activities at different pHs shows that the yeast CM has a pH optimum in the acidic range of pH 5-6 while the E. coli enzyme shows maximal activity at the physiological pH of 7.4. This effect of pH on enzyme activity has been attributed to the presence of glutamate in the yeast (Glu246) and glutamine in the E. coli (Gln88) enzymes (34). In MtbCM, the residue at the corresponding position is a glutamate (Glu109) and is therefore expected to behave like the yeast enzyme, yet paradoxically, the M. tuberculosis enzyme has a pH optimum of 7.5 (15). The difference in the pH profile of MtbCM cannot, therefore, be explained easily, and perhaps detailed electrostatics calculation can shed more light on it.

Accelerated Publications The active site of MtbCM is seen to be blocked due to the presence of a sulfate ion in the structure. The presence of the ion is attributed to its inclusion in the crystallization buffers. Side chains of residues Arg72, Arg134, Lys60, and Gln76 interact with the ion, making a strong ionic association. Interaction with the sulfate ion places the side chains of these residues so that the active site is completely closed for entry to the substrate. It therefore appears that sulfate ion acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme by blocking entry of the substrate into the active site. Interactions of the Allosteric Regulator with MtbCM. Difference electron density maps showed the presence of a Trp at the dimer interface of the enzyme. This site is occupied in both dimers in the crystal asymmetric unit. The binding site of Trp overlaps with the 2-fold symmetry axis; hence, two "half-Trp's" have been modeled at this site in different orientations with each tryptophan being modeled with halfoccupancy. Similarly, the Trp at the interface of the noncrystallographically related dimers is also present at the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis and has therefore been modeled with half-occupancy in two different conformations. The conformation of Trp modeled on the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis is the same as that modeled on the crystallographic 2-fold axis. Within a dimer, the two half-Trp's make identical interactions with both monomers, and interactions of one of the Trp's are depicted in Figures 1b and 4. The Trp at the dimer interface interacts extensively with residues from both subunits (Figure 4). While interactions with one subunit are mostly of the hydrogen bonding type, it makes van der Waals interactions with the other subunit. The carboxyl group of tryptophan bound at the dimer interface interacts with the main chain amide group of residues Ile67 and Glu68. The amino group of Trp forms a close contact with the hydroxyl OH group of Tyr110, while the indole NH group is involved in interaction with the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Leu65. The indole ring also forms several van der Waals interactions with residues from another subunit in the dimer. Binding of Trp at the dimer interface creates a network of interactions involving the allosteric Trp, Tyr110, Glu68, Glu106, and Lys117 (Figure 4). The site of binding of the allosteric regulators, Trp and Tyr, in yeast CM also lies at the dimer interface. However, this allosteric site is placed very far from the substratebinding pocket and therefore enacts a large helical movement during the allosteric transition in yeast CM (7). Interestingly, in MtbCM, while one face of helix 3 contributes to residues involved in monomer-monomer contacts and the allosteric site, the other face contributes to residues involved in the interaction with the substrate. As a result, the allosteric site in MtbCM is close to its substrate binding site. It is therefore likely that helix 3 might play an important role in allostery and hence the regulatory effect observed in the M. tuberculosis enzyme. Pro residues dominate the peptide segment between the apparently duplicated regions of the MtbCM polypeptide (residues 120-128). This region adopts a left-handed polyPro-II conformation. Since such conformational regions are known to bind to cell signaling proteins, such as the SH3 domains (35), it is likely that the secreted MtbCM binds cell surface signaling proteins.

FIGURE 4: Interactions of the allosteric ligand, tryptophan, at the dimer interface. (a) The Fo - Fc difference map shows large density at the interface of the two monomers. Two Trp molecules could account for the density when they were constrained symmetrically. Two Trp molecules were therefore modeled with half-occupancy each as mentioned in the text in detail. (b) Tryptophan interacts with one of the CM polypeptides through main chain and side chain interactions, facilitating a hydrogen bonding network across the two subunits.

DISCUSSION The shikimate pathway involved in the biosynthesis of many important aromatic compounds such as siderophores, menaquinones, and aromatic amino acids has been shown to be indispensable in M. tuberculosis (36, 37). CM constitutes one of the key enzymes at the branch point in this pathway and is involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. Recently, two independent studies have shown that the product of the gene, Rv1885c, from M. tuberculosis possesses a monofunctional CM activity (15, 16). Biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in most organisms is carried out exclusively in the cytoplasm, and hence, the role of CM is believed to be confined to the cytosol. Intriguingly, however, MtbCM has been shown to be secreted in the extracellular medium (15, 16). CMs from several other bacteria, including E. herbicola, S. typhimurium, and P. aeruginosa, have also been shown to exist in the periplasm (11, 17). The periplasmic nature of the various CMs has however remained perplexing. Earlier studies suggest the role of the secretory CMs in virulence among a few of these

7004 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 23, 2006 pathogens such as S. typhimurium and Rhodococcus equi (20, 21). It is interesting to note that products of the genes upstream and downstream of MtbCM are secretory in nature (13). It therefore appears that the entire region on the M. tuberculosis genome flanking Rv1885c might be involved in pathogenesis and might represent an important virulence determinant. It is pertinent to note that while a duplicate set of CMs occurs in the M. tuberculosis genome, only one of the gene products is secreted into the extracellular space. This observation strongly suggests that while the cytosolic enzyme might have retained its role in the aromatic amino acid synthesis pathway, the secreted enzyme is likely to have evolved a distinct role, such as the one aiding the bacterium in its pathogenesis. Structural analysis suggests that evolution of the CM gene might have undergone a gene duplication event as suggested by the similarity of the two halves of M. tuberculosis CM. Such evidence was not discernible from prior sequence comparisons. The possible gene duplication event in MtbCM suggests that the enzyme would constitute two active sites. Intriguingly, however, only one active site is observed in the M. tuberculosis enzyme, reasons for which are elegantly apparent from its crystal structure. Loss of one of the two possible active sites is a consequence of an apparent truncation of helices 1, 5, and 8 of MtbCM. Truncation of the N-terminal part of helix 1 results in the loss of the crucial Arg11, which contributes to the active site in E. coli CM. Similarly, C-terminal truncation of helix 5 and consequent loss of the region corresponding to the loop joining helices 1 and 2 (nomenclature of E. coli CM) also severely affects the active site. Thus, one of the active sites in MtbCM appears to have been abolished postduplication. Another possible reason for the observed gene duplication event might be the necessity for allosteric regulation (38). Indeed, the yeast and M. tuberculosis CMs are allosterically regulated by aromatic amino acids, unlike the E. coli enzyme (15, 39). However, molecular details of the allostery appear to be distinctly different in the two organisms. These differences may be attributed to the dissimilar modes of dimerization, the diverse location of the binding site of the allosteric ligand, and the conformational changes occurring thereof in the two proteins. In yeast CM, the binding sites for the allosteric regulators and the substrate are placed far from each other. As a result, the allosteric regulators effect large conformational changes across the two monomers (6). In MtbCM on the other hand, the allosteric site is close to the active site of the enzyme. Placement of Trp at the dimer interface and its proximity to the main chain NH group of Glu68 appear to be vital for relaying the regulatory effect at the active site in the enzyme. Moreover, the side chain of Glu68 is in contact with the crucial carboxyl of Glu106 through a bridging Lys117. Thus, allostery in MtbCM presumably arises from alterations in the side chain conformations of a few residues, such as Glu106, Tyr110, and Glu68. Major main chain conformational changes, on the other hand, are unlikely to occur in MtbCM. The structure of MtbCM reported in this work offers several new insights into its function. The unexpected gene duplication possibly leads to a different allosteric regulation mechanism than that is known for other CMs. Moreover, its secretory nature and the presence of a Pro-rich region suggest that it might be involved in host-pathogen interactions.
