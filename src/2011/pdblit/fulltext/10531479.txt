Structure of ribosomal protein L30 from Thermus Ê thermophilus at 1.9 A resolution: conformational ¯exibility of the molecule
The crystal structure of ribosomal protein L30 from the extreme thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus has Ê been determined at 1.9 A resolution. The crystals are trigonal and belong to space group P3221, with unit-cell parameters Ê a = b = 63.5, c = 77.8 A,  =  = 90,  = 120 and two molecules per asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by the molecular-replacement method with AMoRe and re®ned with X-PLOR to an R value of 20.3% and an Rfree of 25.3% in the Ê resolution range 8±1.9 A. Detailed analyses of the structures of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit and comparison of T. thermophilus L30 structure with the structure of homologous L30 from Bacillus stearothermophilus reveal two ¯exible regions at opposite ends of the rather elongated molecule. Such ¯exibility could be important for the protein ®tting in the ribosome. A comparison with B. stearothermophilus L30 shows a higher number of salt bridges and unbound positively charged residues and an increased accessible hydrophobic area on the surface of T. thermophilus L30. This could contribute to the stability of both the extreme thermophile protein and the ribosome as a whole.

1. Introduction
Ribosomal protein L30 is one of the smallest ribosomal proteins, with a molecular mass of about 7 kDa. Its binding site on the ribosomal RNA is unknown, but cross-linking experiments indicate that elongation factor Tu can be crosslinked to an extended ribosome neighbourhood containing L30 (San Jose et al., 1976). The crystal structure of L30 from a moderate thermophile B. stearothermophilus was determined in 1986 by the multiple isomorphous replacement method at Ê 2.5 A resolution (Wilson et al., 1986). T. thermophilus is a Gram-negative aerobic eubacterium which can grow at higher temperatures than B. stearothermophilus. It is known that the proteins puri®ed from such extreme thermophiles are more stable than their analogues from moderate thermophiles (Merkler et al., 1981). Protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography are usually described in terms of their atomic coordinates. This gives the impression that proteins are rigid molecules. However, many experiments indicate that proteins are quite ¯exible. In general, there is an equilibrium between a large number of possible conformations (Lillemoen et al., 1997). Homologous proteins from different sources often crystallize in different space groups, which results in the molecules being in different environments (Hosaka et al., 1997; Wimberly et al., 1997). Intermolecular interactions may cause local conformational changes in ¯exible parts of the structure. Identi®caFedorov et al.

Ê al., 1993). The crystals diffracted to 2.3 A resolution, but the protein was dif®cult to isolate from ribosomes on a preparative scale. Cloning and sequencing the spc operon from the T. thermophilus chromosome (Vysotskaya et al., 1997) enabled us to clone the gene encoding L30 and obtain a strain overproducer for this protein (Khairullina et al., 1997).

tion of such ¯exible regions may be of great importance. In the case of ribosomal proteins, this may be useful for understanding rRNA±protein and protein±protein interactions in the ribosome (Unge et al., 1997). In this paper, we report the re®ned crystal structure of L30 Ê from T. thermophilus at 1.9 A resolution and compare the two crystallographically independent molecules with each other as well as with B. stearothermophilus L30.

The characteristics of all data sets are summarized in Table 1.
2.2. Molecular replacement and re®nement

Comparison of the T. thermophilus and the B. stearothermophilus L30 amino-acid sequences revealed 45% identity. This allowed the use of the molecular-replacement method for solving the phase problem. The structure of L30 Crystals of the recombinant protein were obtained under from T. thermophilus was solved with the AMoRe package conditions described for the protein isolated from ribosomes (Navaza, 1994) using the polyalanine model of L30 from (Shikaeva et al., 1993). The crystal space group was P3221, with B. stearothermophilus as a search model. From crystal density Ê Ê unit-cell parameters a = b = 63.5 A, c = 77.8 A,  =  = 90, considerations (Matthews, 1968), there could be two or three  = 120 and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. molecules in the asymmetric unit. Peaks in the cross-rotation Two native data sets were used. The ®rst was collected at function used for the two-body translation function (TF) Ê 80±3.0 A resolution with the four-circle diffractometer Syntex search with a subsequent rigid-body re®nement gave a highcontrasted peak with a correlation coef®cient of 71.8 and an R factor of 40%, while a second peak had corresponding values of 53.9 and 48.5%. A threebody TF search did not reveal any clear peak; two molecules were therefore assumed in the asymmetric unit. The model of L30 from T. thermophilus was subjected to several rounds of model rebuilding with O (Jones et al., 1991) and crystallographic re®nement with X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992). The two molecules in the asymmetric unit were re®ned separately, although NCS restraints were used during the early stages of re®nement. Rfree was calculated throughout the re®nement process, using the same set of test re¯ections each time. 78 water molecules were localized in the later stages of re®nement (Fig. 1).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure of the protein

The model of L30 from T. thermophilus contains 60 amino acids, giving a total of 476 non-H atoms. The overall view of the structure of T. thermophilus L30 and the C-atom trace are presented in Fig. 2. The location of secondary-structure elements within the sequence is shown in Fig. 3. The protein contains a three-stranded antiparallel -sheet ¯anked by two -helices on one side (referred to as the `-side' of the molecule) and exposed on the other (referred to as the `-sheet side' of the molecule). The protein includes the socalled split ±± motif (Orengo & Thornton, 1993) or abc/d unit (E®mov, 1994) formed by the -sheet and helix 2. Helix 1 with two adjacent loops 1 and 2, referred to as the `loop' end (Wilson et al., 1986), is separated from the split ±± motif and is located at one end of the rather elongated L30 molecule. The N and C termini are close to each other on the opposite end of the molecule. Following Wilson et al. (1986), this region is referred to as the `termini' end. The hydrophobic core of the molecule contains the following residues: Val6, Leu8, Ala22, Leu23, Leu26, Leu28,

Val50, Leu53 and Val54. Three of them (Leu26, Val50 and Val54) are invariable in all the known L30 sequences and stabilize the mutual arrangement of the C-termini of both helices and the N-terminus of strand 3. The C atoms of these residues form an approximately isosceles triangle (with their side chains in its plane) lying between the split ±± motif and the loop end of the molecule. A number of hydrophobic residues are partially exposed and most of them form ®ve clearly visible patches on the molecular surface. These patches are located in the loop end (Val9, Pro12, Ile13 and Leu31), in the termini end (Met1 and Pro2), on the -sheet side (Val36 and Val59) and on the -side of the molecule (Leu4, Val47, Ala51, Val56, and Val58; Ala21; Ala25, Leu37, Pro41, Ala42 and Ile43). The last two sets of residues are separated by helix 2. All these patches are involved in intermolecular crystal contacts. Five of the 13 positively charged residues are involved in intramolecular ion-pairing and stabilize the split ±± motif. Two of these residues participate in the isolated ion pairs (Arg3Á Á ÁGlu38 and Asp39Á Á ÁArg44), while the rest contribute to a network of ion pairs. This network is formed by the extensive alternating charge cluster of the side chains of residues Lys5, Lys7, Glu34, Arg55 and Glu57. This cluster is ¯at and parallel to the central part of the exposed side of the -sheet. The other eight positively charged residues are not involved in intramolecular interactions. Most of them (Lys17, Lys20, Lys24, Arg29 and Arg30) are located in the loop end and contribute to an extensive positively charged cluster on the protein surface (Fig. 4). Moreover, all these residues except Lys17 are conserved in most of the known Leu30 sequences. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit of T. thermophilus L30 crystals are rotated by 175 with respect to each other and have different crystal contacts, which induces some conformational changes. The greatest differences in mainchain conformation occur at the termini ends of the molecules. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviation between the C Ê atoms excluding residues 1±3, 36±43 and 58±60 is 0.43 A, in Ê contrast to 0.97 A for all C atoms. The -sheets of the two molecules show different bends along the line connecting residues Arg35, Val6 and Val56, resulting in a maximal Ê displacement of the C atoms in the termini end of up to 2.3 A (Fig. 5a). The different crystal contacts of the molecules in the asymmetric unit cause changes in the side-chain orientation of the residues involved. Thus, the His52 ring of one of the molecules is at 90 to that of other molecule, owing to the hydrogen bond with Asp18 of the symmetry-related molecule.

The overall three-dimensional structure of L30 from T. thermophilus is closely related to that of B. stearothermophilus. Both structures were superimposed using the least-squares option of the program O. This revealed that the main difference is in the mutual arrangement of the split ±± motif and the loop end (Fig. 5b). Helix 1 is rotated

around its axis by approximately 20 and is shifted perpendiÊ cularly to this axis and parallel to the -sheet surface by 1.5 A. However, the spatial structures of the split ±± motif and part of the loop end (residues 14±27) are strictly conserved, Ê with C r.m.s. deviations of 0.38 and 0.35 A, respectively, while superposition of the C atoms of the whole molecule yields an r.m.s. Ê deviation of 1.08 A. L30 from T. thermophilus contains 20 charged residues instead of the 17 found in the B. stearothermophilus protein. A cluster of unbound positive charges in both proteins is located at the loop end, but this cluster is more extensive in T. thermophilus L30 (Fig. 6). Moreover, L30 from T. thermophilus possesses an extra extensive alternating charge cluster of residues bound by a network of ion pairs. These factors could contribute to the stabilization of the structure of the protein from the extreme thermophile. The locations of the four hydrophobic patches on the T. thermophilus L30 surface are very similar to those on the B. stearothermophilus protein. The extra patch at the termini end of L30 from T. thermophilus essentially increases the hydrophobic accessible surface area of this molecule. This may allow additional interactions between L30 and Figure 5 neighbouring protein(s) within the ribosome of A ribbon representation of the T. thermophilus L30 molecule (black) superimposed (a) the extreme thermophile to occur.

showed that all the hydrophobic patches on the molecular surfaces are involved in intermolecular interactions and that the contacts through the hydrophobic patches appear to be the most extensive. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit of T. thermophilus L30 crystals interact through the identical hydrophobic patches on the -side of the molecule and form an extensive intermolecular hydrophobic core. This core, together with the intramolecular cores of both molecules, creates a joint extended hydrophobic core of the dimer, which is packed so tightly that it appears like a single molecule (Fig. 7). The dimer is additionally stabilized by electrostatic interactions of charged residues in the contact region. L30 from B. stearothermophilus crystallized in space group P43212 with one molecule in asymmetric unit. Crystal packing of this protein reveals another type of intermolecular contact. Two symmetry-related molecules interact through a joint extended -sheet containing six antiparallel -strands, which looks like a half a cylinder with four -helices packed on its outside.
3.3. RNA-binding sites in L30

Figure 7

A dimer in the asymmetric unit of T. thermophilus L30 crystals possesses an extended hydrophobic core (black) formed by core residues of both molecules as well as by surface hydrophobic residues in the contact region. Charged residues cover hydrophobic residues in this region. Figs. 7 and 8 were prepared with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).

Ribosomal protein L30 is not a core ribosomal protein. Its binding site on the ribosome probably involves other ribosomal proteins and/or rRNA. Superposition of the L30 structures from two bacteria reveal two ¯exible regions located on the opposite ends of the molecule. The ®rst is the loopend, including helix 1 with adjacent loops 1 and 2. The second region is the termini end of the molecule, including loop 3 and the part of the -sheet which is differently bent in the two molecules within the asymmetric unit of L30 from T. thermophilus. This conformational ¯exibility may be important for L30 to ®t to other components of its binding site in the ribosome. It has previously been proposed that potential RNA-binding sites on the proteins involve patches of conserved positively charged residues (Wilson et al., 1986; Davies et al., 1996). Such patches are located in the ¯exible loop regions in the T. thermophilus and B. stearothermophilus L30 structures. These regions are likely to be involved in rRNA binding. The cluster of unbound positively charged residues is more extensive in L30 from T. thermophilus and could add to the stability of the protein± RNA binding. An increase in the number of salt bridges and unbound positively charged residues and an increase in the accessible hydrophobic area on the surface of the L30 protein from T. thermophilus could contribute to the stability of both the extreme thermophile protein and the ribosome as a whole.
3.4. Protein±protein interactions

Figure 8

The tightest contact between symmetry-related molecules (magenta and green) in CTF crystals is provided by a joint extended hydrophobic core (black) together with the two extended -sheets (bold).

Protein±protein interactions are often mediated through exposed hydrophobic patches. The crystal packing of two homologous L30 proteins clearly illustrates this. There is a number of exposed hydrophobic patches closely related in both proteins. Despite the different space groups of the crystals of L30 from the two bacteria, all these patches are involved in intermolecular crystal contacts. Moreover, formation of a tightly packed dimer in the asymmetric unit of T. thermophilus L30 crystals

is accompanied by amalgamation of the hydrophobic cores of both molecules through the hydrophobic residues in the contact region. Such a type of protein±protein association could be used by L30 in interactions with neighbouring ribosomal protein(s). L30 proteins and the C-terminal fragment of L7/L12 (CTF; accession code 1ctf) from E. coli (Liljas, 1982; Leijonmarck & Liljas, 1987) have very close topology. These proteins contain the so-called split ±± motif, which was subsequently found in a number of other ribosomal proteins: S6, L1, L6, L9 and L22. This motif is suggested to be responsible for interaction with rRNA (Liljas & Al-Karadaghi, 1997). The striking similarity of L30 from B. stearothermophilus to CTF has previously been discussed in detail (Wilson et al., 1986). Detailed analysis of CTF crystal packing reveals intermolecular association through the extended joint hydrophobic core, similar to that found in T. thermophilus L30 crystals. Moreover, this core is enclosed by two extended -sheets (Fig. 8). Protein±protein contact, where a -sheet extends from one molecule into another, was found in B. stearothermophilus L30 crystals. Thus, both types of protein±protein interactions, observed in different L30 crystals, co-exist within one and the same contact region between symmetry-related molecules in the CTF crystals. Protein±protein contacts through the joint extended -sheets in ribosomal proteins were subsequently observed in crystals of S8 from T. thermophilus (Nevskaya et al., 1998) and L14 from B. stearothermophilus (Davies et al., 1996). Therefore, this type of protein±protein interaction may be common for some ribosomal proteins and may be realised within the ribosome.
