Abstract
Monoclinic crystals of hen egg-white lysozyme (E.C. 3.2.1.17, HEL) grown at low pH in the presence of NaNO 3 belong to space group P2t with unit-cell dimensions, a = 28.0, b = 62.5, c = 60.9A and ]~ = 90.8 ° with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. 1.8A resolution intensity data, collected on a CAD-4 diffractometer, contained 17 524 reflections with F > 3o" (93% complete). Our earlier preliminary 1.8 A model was refitted and refined using X-PLOR to an R value of 0.189. The deviations in the model from ideal geometry are 0.013 A in bond lengths and 2.8 ° in bond angles. The r.m.s, deviation in the backbone atoms between the two molecules is 0.42 A. A comparison of HEL in different polymorphic crystal forms reveals that the prominent structural variability among them resides in two exposed regions 45-50 and 65-73 which are also regions of lattice contacts.

1. Introduction
Hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL) has been crystallized in several crystal forms (Steinrauf, 1959). Since the first determination of the structure of the tetragonal form (Blake et al., 1965), the structures in the triclinic, monoclinic and orthorhombic forms have also been determined. Except for the orthorhombic form which has been studied only at low resolution (Artymiuk, Blake, Rice & Wilson, 1982), high-resolution structures of the tetragonal (Diamond, 1974; Kundrot & Richards, 1987), triclinic (Ramanadham, Sieker & Jensen, 1990) and monoclinic (Yu, Rao & Sundaralingam, 1989) crystal forms have been determined. We grew the monoclinic crystals in the presence of NaNO 3 and identified two closely related crystal forms which grew in the same vial from unbuffered solutions. Subsequently we found that one form grew at pH < 6.8 (low pH form or M1) and the other at pH > 7.0 (high pH or M2 form), each containing two molecules in the asymmetric unit (Hogle et al., "1"Yu, Rao & Sundaralingam (1989).

1981). We have studied the M 1 form, which diffracted to higher solution than the M2 form. The structure of M1 at 4 A resolution was determined by MIR method (Hogle et al., 1981) and initially refined at 2.5 ,g, resolution (Rao, Hogle & Sundaralingam, 1983). The results of the preliminary refinement at 1.8A resolution have been reported (Yu et al., 1989). Recently, monoclinic crystals at high pH and high temperature have been obtained (Harata, 1994). The crystals were grown from solutions containing NaCI and 5%(v/v) 1-propanol at 313 K. This form (which we call M2') is reminiscent of our high pH M2 form, which was grown in the presence of NaNO 3 at room temperature and has very similar unit-cell dimensions and two molecules in the asymmetric unit. In both M1 and M2' forms, the two molecules are related by a pseudo B-centering, the pseudo symmetry being stronger in M2'. The structure of the M2' form has been determined and refined at 1.72,~, resolution (Harata, 1994). A third monoclinic form of HEL (a low-humidity form, which we call M3) containing one molecule in the asymmetric unit has been studied at 1.75,~, resolution (Madhusudan, Kodandapani & Vijayan, 1993). The crystals of M3 were formed by growing crystals of the M1 form and the enclosing the crystals in an environment of reduced humidity. The transformation to the M3 form was complete in about 15-20 h. The two molecules related by a pseudo B-centering in the M1/M2' forms are related by an exact lattice translation in the M3 form. In addition to describing the details of completion of the refinement at 1.8 A resolution using X-PLOR (Brtinger, 1992a), a comparison of the seven HEL molecules in the different polymorphic crystal forms, two each in M 1 and M2' forms, one each in M3, tetragonal and triclinic forms, has shown the correspondence between variable regions of the molecule and the regions of lattice contacts.

2. Experimental
Crystallization conditions and the intensity-data collection strategies (Hogle et al., 1981; Yu et al., 1989) have been described previously. Two crystals were used to collect the intensity data between 2.5 and 1.8A resolution using a Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractometer Acta Crystallographica Section D ISSN 0907-4449 01996

A total of 111 solvents and six nitrate ions were included in the final model and the R value was 0.189. The coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977).*

at room temperature (293K). 150 scaling reflections collected on each crystal were used to scale the data sets and the Rmerge(F ) values were in the range 0.018-0.025. A total of 17 524 reflections in the resolution range 8 1.8 A had F > 3 a ( F ) (93% of total) and were used in the present refinement studies (Table 1).

The stereochemicai quality of the model and details of the refinement are contained in Table 1. The r.m.s. deviations in bond lengths and bond angles from ideal values are 0 . 0 1 3 A and 2.3 °, respectively, crA (Read, 1986) as well as Luzzati (1952)°plots indicate an estimated coordinate error of 0.18A. In general, the omit electron density for residues of molecule B was stronger than for those of molecule A. The electron density was consistently clear for the backbone in both molecules, except for the relatively weak electron densities over residues $72, A82, $85, D87, R125, C127, R128 and L129 in molecule A, and T247, G249, T269, N303, N3134, D319, L329 in molecule B. The electron density over the side chains were also uniformly strong, except for a few side chains where the electron density beyond the C , atom was weak: R21, N41, R45, D48, R68, $72, N I l 3 , A122, C127, R128, L129 (in molecule A), N244, R245, N246, R261, R268, T269, $272, R273, D319, N321, C327, R328, L329 (in molecule B). These residues are located in the exposed loop regions and at the C-termini of the molecules. A plot of the average B values for the backbone atoms in the two molecules, against the residue number is shown in Fig. 1.

3. Refinement
The preliminary refinement studies at 1.8,~ resolution were carried out using PROLSQ (Hendrickson, 1985). This model has now been further improved by refitting into minimum bias (Read, 1986) cumulative omit maps (Bhat & Cohen, 1984) and by refinement using the X-PLOR program (Brtinger, 1992a). Three rounds of refitting the starting model followed by conjugategradient refinement using X-PLOR resulted in an R value of 0.25. Solvent sites were selected for the next round of refinement if the difference electron density was > 3o', and in the omit map the density was > 1o- and the site was within 3.4,4, of either a polar atom of the protein or an already characterized solvent. Those that refined to B values > 70,~2 were eliminated from the model. The free R factor (Brtinger, 1992b) was monitored using 10% 30

It is seen that the regions exhibiting large deviations (structural variability) also have large (B) values (large mobility). A superposition of the C,~ trace of the two molecules of M 1 is shown in Fig. 2(a) and a superposition of all seven HEL structures in Fig. 2(b). The deviations between the two molecules of M 1 form are prominent in two loop regions 45-50 (Fig. 3a) and 62-73 (Fig. 3b). The region 46--49 connects the first two strands of the antiparallel ,8-sheet structure, forming part of the active-site cleft along with the region of residues 100--120. These two regions come together by a hinge motion when a substrate analog is bound. W62 residue plays an important role in substrate binding, with the indole moiety being parallel to pyranose sugar residue (Blake, Mair, North, Phillips & Sarma, 1967; Strynadka & James, 1991). The orientation of the indole group of W62 is opposite in the two molecules of M1, with

backbone atoms and all atoms in the two molecules are 18.6, 20.0,~2 for molecule A and 17.1 and 18.3 ,~2 for molecule B, respectively. The trend in the variation of (B) is similar in the two molecules and, as expected, the regions with high (B) values correspond to the residues with weak/poor electron densities. Structures of HEL in different polymorphic crystal forms exhibit a similar behaviour in their (B) values. The r.m.s, deviations between the two molecules in the present study, the two molecules in our earlier 2.5,~ study, the two molecules of the M2' form, the lowhumidity M3 form, the tetragonal and the triclinic structures are tabulated in Table 2. The r.m.s, deviations in the backbone atoms range from 0.42 to 0.83,,~, with the two molecules in the present study being most similar. The largest changes in the present model from our previous 2.5 A model are in the N-terminal residues 1-3, the loop residues 47-54, 70-71,101-102 and the Cterminal residues 127-129, all in regions of high (B). The present high-resolution refinement has made the two

shown to be involved in the pH-dependent self association of lysozyme in solution (Shindo, Cohen & Rupley, 1977). These residues in both the molecules in M1 and the M2' crystal forms are very similar with no direct intermolecular contacts within 3.2A, suggesting no direct influence of these residues in the formation of the two pH-dependent M1 and M2' crystal forms. A total of 111 solvent sites (water molecules) were identified with (B) of 32.5,~2. 20 protein backbone amide N atoms and 30 backbone carbonyl O atoms take part in water interactions in molecule A and 16 and 33 sites in molecule B, respectively. The corresponding numbers for the N and O atoms in the side chains are ten and 24 for molecule A and 11 and 18 for molecule B,

respectively. As found in other proteins (Baker & Hubbard, 1984) the water interactions with protein O atoms are more numerous than with protein N atoms. In other words, the hydrogen bonds involving the protein atoms are probably stronger when the water molecule participates as a donor rather than as an acceptor. Of the 111 water molecules, 94 are in the first hydration shell, nine in the second shell and the remaining in the third shell. Of the 94 waters in the first shell, 52 interact with more than one residue on the same molecule while seven are involved in forming water bridges between neighboring molecules. 24 water molecules associated with molecule A are superposable on the coorresponding sites in molecule B within a distance of 1.25 A and an average deviation of 0.38 ~,. 22 of these water molecules form intramolecular water bridges and stabilize the structure (Fig. 4). The corresponding 24 water sites on molecules A and B of M2' and on the HEL molecule in M3 have average deviations of 0.42, 0.43 and 0.52 ,~, respectively. Many of these sites therefore may be expected to be also occupied in solution. The transformation relating the coordinates of the two molecules in M1 form is, 0.9738 0.2055 -0.0972 -0.1931 0.9734 0.1237 0.1201 -0.1017 0.9875 -14.38 4.35 -31.36

The translations are very close to a/2 (14.0.~,) and c/2 (30.45 ~,), respectively, but the orientations of the two molecules are significantly different. In the high pH M2'

S. T. RAO AND M. S U N D A R A L I N G A M form, the orientational difference of the two molecules is only 4 ° and the pseudo B centering is stronger. In the M3 form, the pseudo B centering becomes an exact lattice translation. It is interesting that while the pseudo centering becomes increasingly prominent as one proceeds from M1 >M2' >M3 monoclinic crystal forms and the solvent volume content in the crystals decreases (34, 32 and 24%, respectively), more of the solvent is ordered.
