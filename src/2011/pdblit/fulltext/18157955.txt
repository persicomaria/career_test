Sequence-to-reactivity algorithms (SRAs) for proteins have the potential of being broadly applied in molecular design. Recently, Laskowski et al. have reported an additivity-based SRA that accurately predicts most of the standard free energy changes of association for variants of turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3) with six serine peptidases, one of which is streptogrisin B (commonly known as Streptomyces griseus peptidase B, SGPB). Non-additivity effects for residues 18I and 32I, and for residues 20I and 32I of OMTKY3 occurred when the associations with SGPB were predicted using the SRA. To elucidate precisely the mechanics of these nonadditivity effects in structural terms, we have determined the crystal structures of the unbound OMTKY3 (with Gly32I as in the wild-type amino acid sequence) at a resolution of 1.16 Å, the unbound Ala32I variant of OMTKY3 at a resolution of 1.23 Å, and the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex (equilibrium association constant Ka = 7.1 × 109 M-1 at 21(±2) C°, pH 8.3) at a resolution of 1.70 Å. Extensive comparisons with the crystal structure of the unbound OMTKY3 confirm our understanding of some previously addressed non-additivity effects. Unexpectedly, SGPB and OMTKY3Ala32I form a 1:2 complex in the crystal. Comparison with the SGPB: OMTKY3 complex shows a conformational change in the SGPB:OMTKY3Ala32I complex, resulting from a hinged rigid-body rotation of the inhibitor caused by the steric hindrance between the methyl group of Ala32IA of the inhibitor and Pro192BE of the peptidase. This perturbs the interactions among residues 18I, 20I, 32I and 36I of the inhibitor, probably resulting in the above non-additivity effects. This conformational change also introduces residue 10I as an additional hyper-variable contact residue to the SRA.

Introduction
The recovery of the native structure and activity of the reduced and denatured bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A showed clearly that the sequence of a protein determines its structure. 1 The same structure and activity exhibited by the naturally occurring and by the chemically synthesized versions of the same enzyme supported the tenet that the activity of a protein can also be determined by its sequence alone.2 In view of the possibility of sequence-to-reactivity algorithms (SRAs) being widely applied in the design of drugs and vaccines, and in the engineering of proteins, considerable effort has been directed to the development of SRAs

528 and it has become one of the main goals of biochemistry. Most researchers attempt this development by dividing the SRAs into two subalgorithms: sequence-to-fold and fold-to-activity. However, the challenges facing the development for the sequence-to-fold sub-algorithm present major impediments.3,4 Ovomucoid is an abundant single-polypeptide glycoprotein present in avian egg whites. Each of its three tandem domains belongs to the Kazal family of standard-mechanism canonical protein inhibitors, presenting a single peptide bond for limited hydrolysis by serine peptidases (i.e. the reactive site), thereby competitively inhibiting these peptidases.5­7 Ovomucoids from closely related avian species vary strikingly in their inhibitory activities and specificities.8 Measurement of the equilibrium association constants, Ka, of the ovomucoid third domains alone with a panel of six serine peptidases, including bovine chymotrypsin A (CHYM), human leukocyte elastase (HLE), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), streptogrisins A and B (commonly known as Streptomyces griseus peptidases A and B, SGPA and SGPB), and subtilisin Carlsberg (CARL) gave a huge range of inhibitory activities (Ka values from 7.1 × 102 M-1 to 1.4 × 1012 M-1) as well as a broad range of specificities9 (Park et al., unpublished results). Examination of the crystal structures of the ovomucoid third domains from the Japanese quail (wtOMJPQ3)10,11 and the silver pheasant (wtOMSVP3),12 and analysis of the amino acid sequences of the ovomucoid third domains from 153 avian species13­15 showed that the structurally important residues are strongly conserved, whereas the residues of the reactive-site loop are hypervariable. Examination of the crystal structures of the wild-type turkey ovomucoid third domain (wtOMTKY3) bound to SGPB,16,17 to HLE18 and to CHYM19 identified ten residues of the inhibitor that are in contact with all of these peptidases. It was proposed that the wide spectrum of inhibitory activities and specificities exhibited by ovomucoid third domains is due to the hyper-variability of these ten consensus contact residues only. The structural effects of any change in these consensus contact residues, and the contributions from the non-contact residues are considered negligible. wtOMTKY3 consists of 56 residues, with its Leu18I­Glu19I peptide bond (the suffix I is used for residues of the inhibitor) acting as the reactive site in the inhibition of at least nine serine peptidases, including the six mentioned above.18,20 Kinetic measurements showed that the truncation of the first five N-terminal residues of wtOMTKY3 has no effect on its inhibitory activity.21 In the crystal structure of the SGPB:wtOMTKY3 complex, the first six N-terminal residues of the inhibitor could not be located in the electron density maps, indicating a high mobility for these residues.16,17 The crystal structure of the SGPB:OMTKY3 complex, in which the first five N-terminal residues of wtOMTKY3 were truncated, confirmed that the structural effects

of this truncation are minor.22 As a result, OMTKY3 (wtOMTKY3 with its first five N-terminal residues truncated; Figure 1) was selected as the basic model for the development of an SRA that determines the inhibitory activity of an OMTKY3 variant from its sequence. Taking advantage of the structural similarity and rigidity of all the OMTKY3 variants, which justifies the use of the additivity approximation,23,24 an additivity-based SRA was recently developed; the standard free energy change of association for an OMTKY3 variant with any of the six serine peptidases (G°a other) is predicted by adding directly to the standard free energy change of association for OMTKY3 with that serine peptidase (G°a OMTKY3) the increments due to the substitution of each hyper-variable consensus contact residue (i G°a Xi) (Figure 2).3,4 In order to test this SRA, a total of 450 values for the standard free energy changes of association (G°a) with the six serine peptidases were experimentally determined for some natural ovomucoid third domains (398 values), some other natural Kazal inhibitors (17 values) and the OMTKY3 variants previously engineered to inhibit human furin 25 (35 values). Of all these values, 64% conformed to additivity, 26% to partial additivity and 9% were non-additive. The distributions of these cases within the three classes of inhibitors are more or less consistent.3,4,26 The validity of the additivity approximation requires that the interaction between any two consensus contact residues of an OMTKY3 variant remains unchanged upon the binding of the inhibitor to the six serine peptidases. Very commonly, avian ovomucoid third domains have Thr17I

and Glu19I. The crystal structure of the unbound wtOMSVP3 shows a hydrogen bond (3.0 Å) between the Thr17I O1 atom and the Glu19I O1 atom.12 However, all of the crystal structures of the complexes of OMTKY3 (including the wild-type and the residue-18I variants, except the Pro18I variant) with SGPB16,17,22,27­29 and with CHYM19 (Ding et al., unpublished results; PDB accession code: 1HJA) determined so far show a shortened hydrogen bond (mean distance: 2.6 Å, standard deviation: 0.1 Å) between the same pair of atoms. Doublemutant cycles illustrate the non-additivity effect in the SRA-based prediction of the G°a of CHYM with OMTKY3-Val17IVal19I as a result of the strengthening of this hydrogen bond upon the binding of OMTKY3 to CHYM. Hence, to avoid this nonadditivity effect, the use of the SRA is restricted to predictions for only the OMTKY3 variants with either Thr17I or Glu19I.4,26 The crystal structures of the complexes of SGPB with both wtOMTKY3 and OMTKY3 show that the regions of the main-chain of Leu18I and of Gly32I, and the side-chains of Tyr20I and Asn36I of OMTKY3 interact with one another indirectly via Pro192BE of SGPB.16,17,22 In the unbound form, the interactions among these residues of OMTKY3 would be different, and this difference would be another origin of non-additivity effects in SRA. In fact, non-additivity effects were found between residues 18I and 32I,30 and between residues 20I and 32I31 in the SRA-based predictions of the G°a of SGPB with OMTKY3 variants. To appreciate how residue 32I contributes to these non-additivity effects, Gly32I has been changed to Ala for the

addition of a side-chain and the decrease in the main-chain conformational flexibility. This substitution essentially retains the tightness of the SGPB: OMTKY3 complex (reduction in Ka only by an order of 10), advantageous to the crystallization of this complex.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination The parameters and statistics derived from X-ray diffraction data processing and structure refinement are summarized in Table 1. Similar to the pre+ viously reported OMTKY3- [CH2NH2 ]Asp19I,32 both OMTKY3 and OMTKY3-Ala32I crystallized in space group P21 with only one OMTKY3 molecule in each asymmetric unit. All residues of the inhibitor (residues 6I to 56I) were clearly discernable in the electron density maps. Most atoms could be located precisely in the 2|Fo|-|Fc|, c maps contoured at the 3.0­4.0 level (Figure 3(a)), whereas some atoms of the N-terminal residues, Leu18I, Glu19I and Arg21I of the reactive-site loop, the surface residues, and the C-terminal residues could only be reliably located in the same maps contoured at the 1.0­2.0 level (Figure 3(b)). In the Ramachandran plot for the crystal structure of the unbound OMTKY3, 92.9% of non-Gly and non-Pro residues are in the most favored regions, and 7.1% are in the additionally allowed regions.

For the unbound OMTKY3 and the unbound OMTKY3-Ala32I, the summation is over 90% of the reflections in the specified resolution range. The remaining 10% of the reflections were randomly selected before the structure refinement and not included in the structure refinement. Rfree was calculated over these reflections using the same equation as for Rwork. R was calculated over all the reflections in the specified resolution range. Similarly, for the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex, 95% of the reflections in the specified resolution range were used in the calculation of Rwork and the remaining 5% of the reflections were used in the calculation of Rfree.

unbound OMTKY3-Ala32I, 95.3% of non-Gly and non-Pro residues are in the most favored regions, and 4.7% are in the additionally allowed regions (Table 1). Surprisingly, the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex crystallized in space group P212121 with one SGPB molecule (molecule E) and two OMTKY3-Ala32I molecules (molecules A and B) in each asymmetric unit. All the residues of molecule E (residues 16E to 242E), molecule A (residues 6IA to 56IA) and molecule B (residues 6IB to 56IB) were identified in the electron density maps. Most atoms could be reliably located in the 2|Fo|-|Fc|,c maps contoured at the 1.0­2.0 level. In the Ramachandran plot for the crystal structure of the SGPB: OMTKY3-Ala32I complex, 88.4% of non-Gly and non-Pro residues are in the most favored regions, 11.2% are in the additionally allowed regions, and 0.4% (Asn100E) is in a disallowed region. With well-defined electron density, Asn100E is on the loop propagating from the strand e to the strand f of the -barrel 1 of SGPB. In the crystal, the mainchain conformation of Asn100E seems to be sterically restricted by its neighboring residues on the e-f loop and by Val176E to Tyr178E on the strand i of the same SGPB molecule (say, from the asymmetric unit x, y, z), and the side-chain of Trp67E and the main-chain of Arg81E of the SGPB molecule from the asymmetric unit 0.5 + x, 0.5­y, -z. The Asn100E N2 atom of the SGPB molecule from the asymmetric unit x, y, z forms a hydrogen bond with the Arg81E carbonyl O atom of the SGPB molecule from the asymmetric unit 0.5 + x, 0.5­y, -z (3.5 Å). Molecular structure of the unbound OMTKY3 The overall structure of the unbound OMTKY3 has the form of a wedge-shaped disc, comprising an extended loop (Ala15I to Arg21I) that contains the reactive site (the Leu18I­Glu19I peptide bond), a small triple-stranded antiparallel -sheet (Leu23I to Ser26I, Asp27I to Tyr31I, Ser51I to His52I) with a type I -turn (Gly25I to Asn28I) and an -helix (Asn33I to Asn45I) positioned between the reactivesite loop and the -sheet. OMTKY3 is structurally rigidified by three disulfide bonds (Cys8I­Cys38I, Cys16I­Cys35I and Cys24I­Cys56I), especially by the first two that anchor the reactive-site loop to the core of the inhibitor. + The crystal structure of the unbound  [CH2NH2 ] Asp19I variant of OMTKY3 has been previously determined in the same space group and unit-cell dimensions as those of the unbound OMTKY3 + reported here.32 In OMTKY3- [CH2NH2 ]Asp19I, the reactive-site carbonyl group of OMTKY3 is reduced to a methylene group, and Glu19I of OMTKY3 is changed to Asp19I. Nonetheless, superposition of the molecular structures of OMTKY3 and + OMTKY3- [CH2NH2 ]Asp19I (rmsd: 0.27 Å for 192 out of 204 main-chain atoms) shows excellent agreement in atomic positions.

wtOMSVP312 have been previously determined in different space groups and unit-cell dimensions from those of the unbound OMTKY3 reported here. The amino acid sequences of OMJPQ3 (wtOMJPQ3 without its first five N-terminal residues) and OMTKY3 differ at residues 17I, 18I, 19I, 23I, 32I and 51I, whereas those of OMSVP3 (wtOMSVP3 without its first five N-terminal residues) and OMTKY3 differ only at residue 18I. Superpositions of the molecular structures of the unbound OMTKY3 with those of the unbound wtOMJPQ3 (rmsd: 0.39 Å to 0.51 Å for 186 to 194 out of 204 main-chain atoms) and the unbound wtOMSVP3 (rmsd: 0.41 Å for 195 out of 204 main-chain atoms) show slightly less good agreement in atomic positions. The crystal structure of the unbound OMTKY3 has also been compared with the representative solution structure of the unbound wtOMTKY333 (rmsd: 1.46 Å for all 204 main-chain atoms). Substantial differences in atomic positions (greater than 1.46 Å) occur in Val6I to Pro14I, the reactive-site loop, the type I -turn, Asn45I to Thr47I, Leu50I, Lys55I and Cys56I. The extensive conformational flexibilities of these regions are shown by the comparisons of the 50 members of the solutionstructure ensemble of the unbound wtOMTKY3; the backbone rmsd value for these regions are

greater than that for the whole structure (0.86 Å). Modeling of the representative solution structure of the unbound wtOMTKY3 in the unit cell defined by the unbound OMTKY3 (not shown) suggests that the conformational differences in most of these regions are caused by the crystal packing of the unbound OMTKY3. In the crystal structure of the unbound OMTKY3, the main-chain and the side-chain B factors of many of the residues in these regions are above the average values. Other residues in these regions have lower B factors, probably because of the dampening effects of crystal packing on their motions (Figure 4(a)). The crystal structure of the unbound OMTKY3 reported here is considered the most relevant model of the unbound ovomucoid third domain for the SRA-related structural studies, because the SRA is based on OMTKY3 and most of the crystal structures previously determined for the development of the SRA contain an OMTKY3 variant. Previously, the crystal structure of the unbound wtOMSVP3 at a lower resolution of 1.5 Å served as a model of the unbound ovomucoid third domain. OMTKY3 and OMSVP3 differ only in the nature of their residue 18I (Leu in the former; Met in the latter). All of the crystal structures of the unbound avian ovomucoid third domains determined so far

532

Structural Insights into the SRA Non-additivity

show that the side-chain of residue 18I is exposed to solvent. Interactions among Thr17I, Glu19I and Arg21I of OMTKY3 The molecular structure of the unbound wtOMSVP3 shows a direct hydrogen bond (3.0 Å) between the Thr17I O1 atom and the Glu19I O1 atom (Figure 5(a)).12 In the molecular structure of the unbound OMTKY3, a hydrogen bond mediated by a water molecule with its O atom 2.7 Å from the Thr17I O1 atom and 2.8 Å from the Glu19I O1 atom instead is observed (Figure 5(b)). Direct hydrogen bonds of shorter lengths (mean: 2.6 Å; standard deviation: 0.1 Å) between the Thr17I O1 atom and the Glu19I O1 atom are observed in all of the crystal structures of the complexes of OMTKY3 (including the wildtype and the residue-18I variants, except the Pro18I variant) with SGPB16,17,22,27­29 and with CHYM19 (Ding et al., unpublished results; PDB accession code: 1HJA) determined so far (Figure 5(c)). The decrease in the length of this hydrogen bond by approximately 0.4 Å indicates an increase in the strength of this hydrogen bond upon the binding of OMTKY3 to SGPB and CHYM. However, this hydrogen bond is not observed in the crystal structures of the CARL:wtOMTKY334 nor in the CARL:OMTKY3 complexes.35 Additionally, in the unbound OMTKY3, the Glu19I amide N atom forms a hydrogen bond (3.3 Å) with the Thr17I O1 atom. This hydrogen bond is observed in the CARL: wtOMTKY3 (3.6 Å) and the CARL:OMTKY3 (molecule C: 3.8 Å; molecule D: 3.6 Å) complexes as well; however, in the complexes of OMTKY3 (including the wild-type and the residue-18I variants) with SGPB, with CHYM and with HLE, the Glu19I amide N atom forms a hydrogen bond with the Glu19I O1 atom (mean distance: 2.7 Å; standard deviation: 0.1 Å) instead. All of these differences in the interactions between Thr17I and Glu19I upon the binding of OMTKY3 to the various serine peptidases result in the non-additivity between residues 17I and 19I in the SRA-based predictions of the G°a value of OMTKY3 variants with these serine peptidases. In the molecular structure of the unbound OMTKY3, ionic interactions occur between the side-chains of Glu19I and Arg21I, with the Glu19I O2 atom 3.3 Å and 3.2 Å away from the Arg21I N and N1 atoms, respectively. These ionic interactions are not observed in the molecular structure of wtOMSVP3,12 or in any of the crystal structures of the complexes of OMTKY3 (including the wild type and the residue-18I variants) with SGPB,16,17,22 , 27­29 , 32 with CHYM 19 (Ding et al., unpublished results; PDB accession code: 1HJA) and with HLE.18 However, these ionic interactions are observed in the CARL:wtOMTKY3 complex,34 and in molecule D of the CARL:OMTKY3 complex.35 This suggests the possibility of non-additivity between residues 19I and 21I in the SRA-based predictions of the G°a value of OMTKY3 variants with CARL.

534 Conformation of the reactive-site loop of OMTKY3 The rigidity of the overall structure of OMTKY3 suggests a lack of conformational change upon the binding of OMTKY3 to serine peptidases. In general, superpositions of the molecular structure of the unbound OMTKY3 with all of the crystal structures of OMTKY3 (including the wild-type and the residue-18I variants) bound to SGPB, CHYM and HLE determined so far show excellent agreement in atomic positions. The spread of the rmsd values for these superpositions (0.43 Å to 0.71 Å for 196 to 202 out of 204 main-chain atoms) indicates the difference in some local conformational changes required for the binding of OMTKY3 to different peptidases, and the difference in the space groups and the unit-cell dimensions of the complexes of OMTKY3 with different peptidases. The crystal structure of the CARL: OMTKY3 complex reveals OMTKY3 molecules in two different conformations (molecules C and D in the asymmetric unit of the CARL:OMTKY3 complex).35 Superpositions show that the conformation of the unbound OMTKY3 resembles that of molecule C (rmsd: 0.48 Å for 186 out of 204 mainchain atoms) more closely than that of molecule D (rmsd: 0.85 Å for 198 out of 204 main-chain atoms). Canonical protein inhibitors share a common main-chain conformation for the residues of their reactive-site loops; this common conformation is only affected in local regions of the reactive site loop whether the inhibitors are unbound or bound to their target peptidases.6,7 As shown in Table 2, the  and  angles of the residues of the reactive-site loops of the unbound OMTKY3, wtOMJPQ310,11 and wtOMSVP312 agree within the positional uncertainties of these crystal structures. However, upon the binding of OMTKY3 to SGPB,16,17,22 CHYM,19 HLE18 and CARL,34,35 adjustments in the  and  angles of residues Ala15I to Glu19I of OMTKY3 are observed. The angles  and  of Ala15I of OMTKY3 change significantly upon the binding of OMTKY3 to CARL. In fact, inconsistent changes (though not by statistically significant amounts) in the same  and  angles also seem to occur upon the binding of OMTKY3 to SGPB, CHYM and HLE. Some researchers have questioned the inclusion of Ala15I in the definition of the reactive-site loop of OMTKY3.7 The angles  and  (especially the latter) of Leu18I of OMTKY3 change quite consistently upon the binding of OMTKY3 to SGPB, CHYM, HLE and CARL (Table 2 and Figure 6). These adjustments could be justified by the need for the insertion of the side chain of Leu18I of OMTKY3 into the S1 specificity pockets of these serine peptidases; they may be facilitated by the main-chain conformational adjustments in Thr17I and Glu19I of OMTKY3. The  angle of Thr17I and the  angle of Glu19I of OMTKY3 change consistently upon the binding of OMTKY3 to SGPB, CHYM, HLE and CARL, whereas the  angle of Thr17I and the  angle of Glu19I of OMTKY3 change consistently upon the binding of OMTKY3 to SGPB, CHYM and HLE only, but not to CARL (Table 2).

to the strengthening of the hydrogen bond between the Thr17I O1 atom and the Glu19I O1 atom, and the switch in the hydrogen-bonding partner of the Glu19I amide N atom upon the binding of OMTKY3 to SGPB, CHYM and HLE, but not to CARL. The consistent changes in the  angle of Thr17I, the  and  angles of Leu18I, and the  angle of Glu19I upon the binding of OMTKY3 to the clan-SA serine peptidases SGPB, CHYM, and HLE, and to the clan SB serine peptidase CARL indicate the convergent evolution of the active sites of the serine peptidases in these two clans. The inconsistent changes in the  and  angles further from the reactive site upon the binding of OMTKY3 to these serine peptidases indicate the structural differences in the rest of their substrate-binding regions, especially those between the clan SA serine peptidases and the clan SB ones (Table 2). Interestingly, the crystal structures of the complexes of SGPB with all but one of the residue-18I variants of OMTKY3 determined so far (12 out of the 19 possible variants)22,27­29,32 show that substitutions of the side-chains of residue 18I do not affect the  and  angles of Thr17I to Glu19I of the SGPBbound OMTKY3 (values not shown). The only exception is the Leu-to-Pro substitution; the conformationally most restrictive Pro18I forces the  angle of Thr17I to 140.6 ° and the  angle of Pro18I to -89.5°. Probably because of the pull by the hydrogen bond between the Thr17I O1 atom and the Glu19I O1 atom (3.2 Å), the  angle of Glu19I comes to 141.6 °. The crystal structure of the CHYM: OMTKY3-Lys18I complex (Ding et al., unpublished results; PDB accession code: 1HJA) also shows that the Leu-to-Lys substitution of residue 18I of OMTKY3 does not affect the  and  angles of Thr17I to Glu19I of the CHYM-bound OMTKY3 (values not shown). Structural effects of the Gly-to-Ala substitution of residue 32I of the unbound OMTKY3 The overall structure of the unbound OMTKY3Ala32I is virtually identical to that of the unbound OMTKY3. Superposition of the molecular structure of the unbound OMTKY3 with that of its unbound Ala32I variant (rmsd: 0.13 Å for 194 out of 204 mainchain atoms) shows excellent agreement in most atomic positions. The distributions of the mainchain and the side-chain B factors for all of the residues of the unbound OMTKY3 (in particular the main-chain B factor of residue 32I) remain essentially unchanged upon the Gly-to-Ala substitution (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The unbound OMTKY3 and its unbound Ala32I variant agree well in the mainchain conformation of the reactive-site loop (Table 2) and of residue 32I (,  angles: -72.3 °, -26.8° for Gly, -68.4°, -30.8° for Ala). The Gly-to-Ala substitution does not influence the spatial relationships among Leu18I, Tyr20I, residue 32I and Asn36I of the unbound OMTKY3. In the unbound OMTKY3Ala32I, neither a direct nor a water-mediated hydrogen bond occurs between the side-chains of

Thr17I and Glu19I. Only a long hydrogen bond between the Thr17I O1 atom and the Glu19I amide N atom (3.5 Å) is observed. Ionic interactions occur between Glu19I and Arg21I, with the Arg21I N and N1 atoms 3.2 Å and 3.1 Å away from the Glu19I O2 atom, respectively (Figure 5(d)). Molecular structure of the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex The asymmetric unit of the SGPB:OMTKY3Ala32I complex includes one SGPB molecule (molecule E) and two OMTKY3-Ala32I molecules (molecules A and B) (Figure 7(a)), in contrast to those for the crystal structures of the complexes between SGPB and the other OMTKY3 variants determined so far that include one SGPB molecule and one OMTKY3 molecule. 16,17,22,27­29,32 The OMTKY3 molecule in the latter complexes corresponds to molecule A of OMTKY3-Ala32I in the crystal structure of the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex. As standard-mechanism inhibitors, OMTKY3 and its variants form a 1:1 complex with SGPB. So far there has been no evidence for the existence of a 1:2 complex of SGPB with any of the OMTKY3 variants in solution. The large value of the Ka of the SGPB: OMTKY3-Ala32I complex (109 M-1) indicates the possibility of using a highly homogeneous solution of the complex (see Materials and Methods) in the attempts of growing crystals with the complex in a stoichiometry of 1:1, containing one SGPB molecule and molecule A of OMTKY3-Ala32I only, in the space group P21. Such attempts however have not been successful. The overall structures of all three molecules are preserved in the complex. Molecule A of OMTKY3Ala32I binds to SGPB in the expected manner, with the reactive-site loop of the former occupying the substrate-binding region of the latter (Figure 7(b)). In contrast to those of the unbound OMTKY3-Ala32I (Figure 4(b)), the main-chain and the side-chain B factors of residues of the reactive-site loop of molecule A are generally near or below the average values (Figure 4(c)), probably as a result of the immobilization of the reactive-site loop of molecule A by the substrate-binding region of SGPB. A total of 1272 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area is buried. The shape correlation statistic of this interface is 0.77, well within the range of commonly observed values at the interfaces between peptidases and protein inhibitors (0.70 to 0.76).36 Also, these two values are very close to those of the SGPB:

OMTKY3 complex22 (1209 Å2 and 0.79, respectively). The numerous and extensively distributed interactions between SGPB and molecule A in the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex are in essentially the same pattern as those between SGPB and OMTKY3 in that complex, except that, strikingly, a hydrogen bond between the Gly173E N atom and the Glu10IA O2 atom (2.5 Å) is observed in the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex, but not in the SGPB:OMTKY3 complex (Figure 7(c)). Superposition of the molecular structure of the unbound OMTKY3-Ala32I with that of molecule B of OMTKY3-Ala32I in the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex (rmsd: 0.43 Å for 195 out of 204 main-chain atoms) shows good agreement in most atomic positions. The binding of molecule B to SGPB buries a total of 1210 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area. The shape correlation statistic of this interface is 0.55, substantially lower than that of the interface between molecule A and SGPB. Three hydrogen bonds are observed at the interface, one between the Asp29E O1 atom and the Ser51IB O atom (2.7 Å), one between the Ala30E N atom and the Leu50IB carbonyl O atom (3.2 Å), and one between the Ser79E O atom and the Val6IB N atom (2.7 Å). In addition, there are six contacts dispersed as small patches throughout the interface, involving six residues of SGPB (Arg41E, Ala68E, Ile113E, Pro114E, Ser141E and Gly156E) and four residues of molecule B (Thr47IB, Thr49IB, His52IB and Phe53IB). None of the residues of the reactive-site loop of molecule B are involved in these contacts. The reactive-site loop of molecule B is exposed to the solvent. Its main-chain conformation is in good agreement with that of the unbound OMTKY3-Ala32I (Table 2). In contrast to those of molecule A and the unbound OMTKY3-Ala32I (Figure 4(b) and (c)), the main-chain and the sidechain B factors of the N-terminal residues of the reactive-site loop of molecule B are near or above the average values (Figure 4(d)); this indicates the relatively high mobility of these residues, probably because of the lack of crystal contacts. In particular, the electron densities of Ala15IB and Cys16IB are not well defined. These features suggest that the interactions between SGPB and molecule B are of no biochemical or biological significance. Superposition of the SGPB molecule from the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex with that in the SGPB:OMTKY3 complex22 (rmsd: 0.27 Å for 695 out of 740 main-chain atoms) shows excellent agreement in most atomic positions, indicating that the structural effects on SGPB caused by the binding

of molecule B of OMTKY3-Ala32I is minimal. Moreover, there are no interactions between molecules A and B in the same asymmetric unit of the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex. Therefore, with regard to their structures and interactions with SGPB, molecules A and B in the same asymmetric unit probably have no influence on each other, either directly or indirectly via SGPB.

Structural effects of the Gly-to-Ala substitution of residue 32I of the SGPB-bound OMTKY3 Superposition of the SGPB:OMTKY3 complex with the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex (with molecule B of OMTKY3-Ala32I excluded from the latter; rmsd: 0.27 Å for 712 out of 944 main-chain atoms) shows that the atomic positions of the

538 peptidase molecules agree closely with each other, whereas the inhibitor molecules are well aligned only in their reactive-site loops. With the reactivesite loop as a hinge, the Gly-to-Ala substitution at residue 32I of OMTKY3 causes a rotation of the body

of the inhibitor through an angle of 21° (Figure 8(a)). This rotation brings the Gly173E N atom and the Glu10IA O2 atom into sufficiently close proximity to form a short hydrogen bond (2.5 Å). Therefore, residue 10I should be added to the set of hyper-

539 are exhibited by the  and  angles of OMTKY3 in the crystal structure of the CARL:OMTKY3 complex, resulting in the two different conformations of OMTKY3.35 Nonetheless, in the SGPB:OMTKY3Ala32I complex, due to the steric hindrance between Pro192BE and Ala32IA, it seems unlikely for molecule A to adopt two different conformations as were observed for the CARL:OMTKY3 complex. Interactions among Leu18I, Tyr20I, residue 32I and Asn36I of SGPB-bound OMTKY3 In the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex, the Ala32IA C atom makes contacts with the C and C atoms of Pro192BE and is located exactly at the position of the Gly32I C atom of OMTKY3 in the SGPB:OMTKY3 complex (Figure 8(c)). Thus, it is highly likely that the hinged rigid-body rotation of molecule A of OMTKY3-Ala32I in the SGPB: OMTKY3-Ala32I complex is caused by the steric hindrance between the methyl group (C atom) of Ala32IA and the atoms of Pro192BE. The results of this steric hindrance are indicated by the moderate peaks in the plots of the  and  angles of residue 32I in Figure 9. In contrast, there is virtually no conformational change in the loop containing Pro192BE of SGPB in response to the Gly-to-Ala substitution of residue 32I of OMTKY3. The contact between Leu18I of OMTKY3 and Pro192BE of SGPB is not affected by the Gly-to-Ala substitution of residue 32I of OMTKY3, as a result of the conservation of the main-chain conformation of the reactive-site loop of OMTKY3. However, the hinged rigid-body rotation of molecule A of OMTKY3-Ala32I in the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex moves the side-chains of Tyr20IA and Asn36IA away from Pro192BE. This modulates the interactions (mediated by Pro192BE of SGPB) among Leu18I, Tyr20I, residue 32I and Asn36I of OMTKY3 (Figure 8(c)). This result shows that the non-additivity effects in the SRA resulting from the changes in the interactions among these residues upon the binding of OMTKY3 to SGPB are complicated by substitutions of residue 32I of OMTKY3.

variable contact residues of the SRA whenever the binding of an OMTKY3 variant with Ala32I is considered. This also suggests the possibility of introducing additional hyper-variable contact residues to the SRA as residue 32I of OMTKY3 is substituted with residues having even bulkier side-chains, thereby possibly causing more dramatic conformational changes in the SGPB:OMTKY3 complex. Superpositions of molecule A of OMTKY3-Ala32I in the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex with both the unbound OMTKY3-Ala32I (rmsd: 0.80 Å for 203 out of 204 main-chain atoms) and the SGPB-bound OMTKY322 (rmsd: 0.71 Å for 203 out of 204 mainchain atoms) show good alignment in all parts of the inhibitor molecules except for the residues of the reactive-site loops (Figure 8(b)). The main-chain conformational changes of the reactive-site loop, except those for Ala15I, of OMTKY3-Ala32I upon the binding of OMTKY3-Ala32I to SGPB (as molecule A in the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex) are consistent with those associated with the binding of OMTKY3 to SGPB (Table 2). These results show that the hinged rotation of molecule A in the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex occurs in a rigidbody manner. In molecule A, the Thr17IA O1 atom forms a direct hydrogen bond with the Glu19IA O1 atom (2.6 Å). The Glu19IA O1 atom also forms a hydrogen bond with the Glu19IA amide N atom (2.7 Å). However, no hydrogen bonds are observed between the side-chains of Glu19IA and Arg21IA (Figure 5(e)). In order to locate the  and  angles responsible for the hinged rigid-body rotation of molecule A of OMTKY3-Ala32I in the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex, the absolute differences in the  and  angles between molecule A and the SGPB-bound OMTKY3, and the sum of these differences are plotted for all residues (Figure 9). Obviously, there is a statistically significant peak for the  angle of Ala15I, the N terminus of the reactive-site loop. However, none of the angles on the C-terminal side of the reactive-site loop shows a statistically significant peak. The peaks for the  and  angles of Pro22I, probably because of its conformational restrictions, are high but are not statistically significant. Interestingly, similar trends

The 2.7 of || and || is indicated by the broken line, and that of || +|| is indicated by the dotted line (see Materials and Methods).

540 Relationships between the conformation and the crystal packing of the SGPB:OMTKY3 complex Crystal structures of the complexes of SGPB with all the OMTKY3 variants determined so far show that residue 32I of OMTKY3 is not exposed to the solvent; it makes contacts with Pro192BE of SGPB. Therefore, the Gly-to-Ala substitution of residue 32I of OMTKY3 does not seem likely to modify the surface properties of the 1:1 SGPB:OMTKY3 complex, nor to change its preference for space group P21 in crystallization, unless the complex undergoes a conformational change. Assuming that the SGPB: OMTKY3-Ala32I complex had adopted a 1:1 stoichiometry (containing the SGPB molecule and molecule A of OMTKY3-Ala32I only), modeling studies (results not shown) suggest that the hinged rigid-body rotation of inhibitor molecule A results in a conformational change of this complex that disfavors its packing in the P21 unit cell defined by the complexes of SGPB with the other OMTKY3 variants determined so far. The P212121 unit cell reported here is more spacious and better able to accommodate the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex. It is even possible to fill up the remaining space by adding a second OMTKY3-Ala32I molecule (molecule B) to each unit of the complex. The Matthews coefficient of the P212121 crystal is 1.9 Å3/Da, within the range of commonly observed values for macromolecular crystals (1.7 Å3/Da to 3.5 Å3/Da).37 Few crystal contacts involve molecule A, suggesting that the hinged rigid-body rotation of molecule A is not a consequence of the change in crystal packing. Rigid-body protein­protein interactions, a requirement for the validity of the additivity approximation in the SRA Using the additivity approximation, a computationally simple SRA that predicts the Ka of an OMTKY3 variant with six serine peptidases was developed.3,4 A test of the SRA with 450 inhibitors showed that 90% of the predictions were accurate or partially accurate.26 The validity of the additivity approximation requires that the interaction between any of the two hyper-variable consensus contact residues of the inhibitor remains unchanged upon the binding of the inhibitor to the six serine peptidases. The overall structure of OMTKY3 is rigid, and remains unchanged upon the binding of OMTKY3 to the serine peptidases; this is one of the factors contributing to the high success rate of the SRA.4 However, OMTKY3 is not an ideal rigid body; as shown by the structures determined so far (including the three reported here), OMTKY3 has several conformationally flexible regions, one of which is its reactive-site loop. Important for the physiological function of OMTKY3, the conformational flexibility of the reactive-site loop allows for the adaptability of OMTKY3 in inhibiting a broad range of serine peptidases. Analysis of the molecular structures of the unbound OMTKY3 and OMTKY3

Structural Insights into the SRA Non-additivity

bound to different serine peptidases shows that adjustments do occur in the main-chain conformation of the reactive-site loop of OMTKY3 upon the binding of the inhibitor to the peptidases (Table 2). These conformational adjustments are accompanied by changes in the interactions within some pairs of the hyper-variable consensus contact residues of OMTKY3, resulting in the non-additivity effects in the SRA. For example, the changes in the  and  angles of Thr17I to Glu19I upon the binding of OMTKY3 to SGPB, CHYM and HLE are accompanied by the strengthening of the hydrogen bond between the Thr17I O1 atom and the Glu19I O1 atom, and the switch in the hydrogen-bonding partner of the Glu19I amide N atom of OMTKY3; this leads to the non-additivity effects for residues 17I and 19I. The non-ideal rigid-body behavior of OMTKY3 limits the performance of the SRA; in the test with 450 inhibitors, 10% of the predictions were inaccurate.26 The problem in accounting for non-additivity effects remains somewhat unsettled; its complexity is the primary reason. For example, the occurrence of non-additivity effects for a particular pair of residues of OMTKY3 depends on which peptidase the inhibitor binds to. Double substitutions of residues 17I and 19I of OMTKY3 have been studied, and some restrictions have been established for the use of the SRA. Initially, it was found that, for SGPB, CHYM and HLE being the target peptidases, SRA-based predictions are accurate only for the OMTKY3 variants with either Thr17I or Glu19I present (i.e. 38 of all possible variants). Later, it was suggested that additivity holds as long as there is no strong interaction, such as ionic or hydrogen-bonding interaction, between residues 17I and 19I of the OMTKY3 variant; this requirement could be fulfilled by 49 additional variants, as Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met and Phe normally do not interact strongly with each other.4,26 The results of recent studies further suggest that additivity also holds for either one of residues 17I and 19I being polar and the other one being non-polar. However, additivity does not hold if both residues 17I and 19I are charged or polar (results not shown). Interactions between the active sites of serine peptidases and the reactive site of OMTKY3 Previous studies showed that the dissociations of the complexes of both the virgin (i.e. the reactive site is intact) and the modified (i.e. the reactive site is hydrolyzed) wtOMTKY3 with eight serine peptidases, including CHYM, PPE, SGPA, SGPB and CARL, release the virgin wtOMTKY3 predominantly (>90%).20 This indicates that these peptidases catalyze both the hydrolysis and the transpeptidation of the reactive site of OMTKY3, even though the reactive site of OMTKY3 is intact in all of the crystal structures of OMTKY3 (including the wildtype and the residue-18I variants) bound to SGPB,16,17,22,27­29,32 CHYM19 (Ding et al., unpublished results; PDB accession code: 1HJA), HLE18

Similar to previous studies,39,40 geometric parameters are defined to describe the trajectories of the attack by the nucleophilic O atom (the catalytic Ser O atoms of the serine peptidases in the acylation step, or the O atom of the nucleophilic water molecule in the deacylation step) at the reactive-site carbonyl C atom of OMTKY3 (Figure 10(a) and (b)).

and CARL34,35 determined so far. Comparisons of the crystal structures of the modified wtOMJPQ3 and wtOMSVP3 with their virgin versions show that the hydrolysis of the reactive site increases the mobility of the reactive-site loop, but has little effect on the interactions within the rest of the inhibitor.38 The extensive interactions of OMTKY3 with SGPB, CHYM, HLE and CARL probably keep the reactive site of OMTKY3, no matter whether it is intact or

Geometric parameters are defined to describe the trajectory of the attack at the reactive-site carbonyl C atom of an inhibitor. (a) acylation step, with the catalytic Ser O atom of a serine peptidase as the nucleophile. Plane A is defined by the P1 C and carbonyl O atoms, and the P1 amide N atom of the inhibitor. Plane B is defined by the catalytic Ser O atom of the peptidase and the P1 carbonyl C and O atoms of the inhibitor. d is the distance between the catalytic Ser O atom of the peptidase and the P1 carbonyl C atom of the inhibitor.  is the displacement of the P1 carbonyl C atom of the inhibitor out of plane A. 1 is the angle between planes A and B. 2 is the angle O(catalytic Ser of the peptidase)-C=O(P1 of the inhibitor). (b) Deacylation step, with the O atom of the nucleophilic water molecule as the nucleophile. Definitions are the same as in (a), except that the catalytic Ser O atom of the peptidase is replaced by the O atom of the nucleophilic water molecule, and that the P1 amide N atom of the inhibitor is replaced by the catalytic Ser O atom of the peptidase. (c) Catalytic triad of a serine peptidase (orange), and the P3, P2 and P1 residues (with side-chains R3, R2 and R1, respectively) of an inhibitor (green). R and R represent the N and the C-terminal residues of the inhibitor, respectively. Hydrogen bonds are indicated by broken lines. Partial charges are indicated by + and -. The dipole across the P2­P1 peptide bond of the inhibitor is indicated by a straight arrow with a cross at its positive end. Electron flows in the acylation step are indicated by curved arrows.

542 In all of the complexes of OMTKY3 and wtOMTKY3 with SGPB, CHYM, HLE and CARL, the catalytic triad of the peptidase is properly positioned for strong hydrogen bonding between the Ser O atom and the His N2 atom (2.5 Å to 2.8 Å; Table 3), and between the His N1 atom and the Asp O2 atom (2.6 Å to 2.9 Å; Table 3), thereby forming a chargerelay system that facilitates the progress of catalysis (Figure 10(c)). The parameter d is of the same order as the distance of a strong hydrogen bond (2.6 Å to 2.9 Å; Table 3), indicating some weak orbital interactions between the catalytic Ser O atom of

the peptidase and the reactive-site carbonyl C atom of the inhibitor. However, as indicated by the parameter  (maximum: 0.044 Å in the SGPB: wtOMTKY3 complex, with an overall positional uncertainty of 0.485 Å16,17; Table 3), a statistically significant tetrahedral distortion of the reactive-site carbonyl C atom of OMTKY3, which could result from the change in its hybridization state from sp2 to sp3, is not observed. Both 1 (80.4 ° to 88.5°; Table 3) and 2 (89.2° to 102.4°; Table 3) are statistically close to 90°. All these distances and angles fall in the ranges of their corresponding values in the other

grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at ambient temperature within one week. The drop of the complex contained equal amounts of the complex solution and the reservoir solution (0.2 M sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.1 M Tris­hydrochloride (pH 8.5) and 26% polyethylene glycol 4000). A diffraction-quality fragment was selected from one of the crystal clusters. For cryoprotection, all of the crystals were soaked for approximately 10 s in their respective reservoir solutions with 40% (v/v) glycerol included, and then immediately frozen in the liquid nitrogen for storage and subsequent shipment to the synchrotron beamline. Data collection and processing, and structure solution and refinement The X-ray diffraction data from all crystals were collected at the synchrotron Beamline 8.3.1 (equipped with an ADSC-Q210 CCD detector) at the Advanced Light Source in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. All data sets were indexed, scaled and merged using DENZO and SCALEPACK.45 Structure solution and refinement were carried out in CCP4.46,47 All structures were solved by the molecular replacement method, with search models provided by the structure of the SGPB:OMTKY3 complex (PDB accession code: 1SGR).22 All structures were solved using MOLREP,48 iteratively refined using REFMAC.49 and adjusted during refinement with XtalView/Xfit.50 The structures of the unbound OMTKY3 and its unbound Ala32I variant were at the end refined anisotropically with riding hydrogen atoms included. The stereochemical qualities of the final structures were assessed using PROCHECK.25 Structure analysis Graphical representations of the structures were prepared using PyMOL. Peptide planes and their tetrahedral distortions were calculated using GEOMCALC§. The surface areas of structures were calculated using NACCESS¶. The interactions and shape complementarities of protein­protein interfaces were analyzed using LIGPLOT51 and Sc,36 respectively. Superpositions of structures were carried out using ALIGN,52,53 based on the main-chain atoms (amide N, C, and carbonyl C and O). The representative of the solution-structure ensemble of the wtOMTKY3 was chosen using OLDERADO.54 The overall positional uncertainties of crystal structures (r) were roughly estimated using the diffraction-component precision indices (DPI),55 They were then converted to the uncertainties of the differences in the main-chain angles between crystal structures (). Differences exceeding 2.7 are considered significant.

complexes of serine peptidases with protein inhibitors,39 and are also statistically close to their corresponding values in the acylation of a Michaelis complex (with cucurbita pepo trypsin inhibitor II, CPTI-II41; Table 3) and in the deacylation of two good acyl-enzyme intermediates (one with succinylAla-Ala-Pro-Arg-p-nitroaniline, AAPR, and one with succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Lys-p-nitroaniline, AAPK 40 ; Table 3) of trypsin. It is noteworthy that, in all of the complexes of OMTKY3 and wtOMTKY3 with SGPB, CHYM, HLE and CARL, and in the Michaelis complex, the tetrahedral intermediate (the trypsin-leupeptin complex)40 and the good acyl-enzyme intermediates of trypsin, the catalytic Ser O atom of the peptidase also forms a hydrogen bond (2.8 Å to 3.0 Å; Table 3) with the P1 amide N atom of the inhibitor (nomenclature based on that by Schechter & Berger 42 ). The catalytic Ser O  atom of the peptidase is positioned near the positive end of the dipole across the P2­P1 peptide bond of the inhibitor; thus, the partial negative charge developed at the catalytic Ser O atom of the peptidase upon the proton transfer from this atom to the catalytic His N 2 atom of the peptidase is stabilized, and the nucleophilicity of the catalytic Ser O atom for the reactive-site carbonyl C atom in the acylation step is enhanced (Figure 10(c)). This serves as an example of substrate-assisted catalysis. Similar enhancement in nucleophilicity does not seem to happen to the O atom of the nucleophilic water molecule in the deacylation step. Although the Gly-to-Ala substitution of residue 32I of OMTKY3 results in the conformational change of the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex, it has virtually no effect on the geometry of the interactions between the active site of SGPB and the reactive site of OMTKY3 (Table 3).

Materials and Methods
Preparation and crystallization of the proteins OMTKY3 and OMTKY3-Ala32I were cloned, overexpressed and purified as described.43 Diffractionquality crystals of both OMTKY3 and its Ala32I variant were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at ambient temperature in two to three days, from a drop containing equal amounts of the protein solution (approximately 10 mg /ml in water) and the reservoir solution (Condition number 41 of the Hampton Research Crystal Screen: 0.1 M Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) isopropanol, 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000). SGPB, purified from Pronase as described,44 was a generous gift from L. B. Smillie (Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta). An approximately 20 mg/ml solution of the SGPB:OMTKY3-Ala32I complex was prepared by mixing SGPB and OMTKY3Ala32I in water in a 1:1.5 molar ratio. To remove the excess OMTKY3-Ala32I molecules, the complex solution was ultra-filtered at a molecular-mass cutoff of 10,000. Clusters of needle-shaped crystals of the complex were
