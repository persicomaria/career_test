Abstract
Crystal structures of FimH, PapG, GafD, and DraE fimbrial adhesin subunits or lectin domains have been resolved. These adhesins bind to different targets and are only distantly related in amino acid sequence. The overall structures of the fimbrial lectins, however, appear similar, suggesting that the fimbrial lectins have diverged from a common scaffold. FimH, PapG and GafD are two-domain structures connected by a flexible linker, and the N-terminal adhesin domains have an elongated b-barrel jelly roll fold that contains the receptor-binding groove. The adhesin domains differ in disulfide patterns, in size and location of the ligand-binding groove, as well as in mechanism of receptor binding. Minor sequence variations that can be either distant from, near to, or at the ligand-binding groove have profound effects on receptor binding by the fimbriae; this is particularly apparent with FimH. The existing structures give insight into the molecular basis of the diversity in fimbrial lectins. r 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Ability to adhere is an important determinant in tissue tropism of bacterial colonization and helps E. coli to resist mechanical defences of the host. The precise number of fimbrial types expressed by E. coli remains in doubt ≠ due to e.g. our limited knowledge as well as differing definitions of ``a fimbrial type'' ≠ but the number is likely to be closer to 100 than to 10. Fimbriae are long filamentous structures made up of hundreds of copies of the major subunit, fimbrillin, and an E. coli cell may simultaneously express up to 200 copies of the

filament. Thus, fimbriation represents a major energy expenditure in physiology of E. coli. The primary function of the fimbriae, i.e. binding to receptors, is in most cases mediated by a fimbrial minor component (adhesin) that can be located at the tip of the filament and at a few sites along the filament (for examples on the common, mannoside-binding type 1 fimbriae (see Krogfelt et al., 1990; Jones et al., 1995; Lin et al., 2002). In some fimbrial types the major subunit also is the adhesin (Bakker et al., 1992; Van Loy et al., 2002). The problems in defining a fimbrial type mainly arise from immunological variation within and across fimbrial types as well as from minor sequence variations in the adhesive subunit. The serological variation of fimbriae is dictated by the structure of the major fimbrillin subunit, whereas even a small sequence variation in the adhesive subunit can have profound effects on the binding; thus serological identity and biological function can vary independently. Considerable progress has been made in revealing the mechanisms in the biogenesis of fimbrial filaments and the regulation of fimbriae expression; also, our understanding of the receptor specificities and the biological importance of fimbrial types have advanced (for reviews, see Soto and Hultgren, 1999; Klemm and Schembri, 2000; Mulvey, 2002; Holden and Gally, 2004; Sauer et al., 2004). A detailed knowledge on the molecular interactions between an adhesin and its receptor is crucial for the understanding of pathogenetic mechanisms and in the design of anti-adhesive drugs or vaccine components against bacterial infectious diseases. Here we will focus our discussion on the recently published crystal structures of fimbrial adhesin domains and their structural variations that lead to novel binding specificities and give insight into the evolution of the multiple fimbrial types in E. coli.

Multifunctional nature of E. coli fimbriae
An E. coli strain can express several fimbrial types, which individually ≠ as well as in concert ≠ exhibit a striking repertoire of adhesive functions. Most fimbrial adhesins of E. coli bind to carbohydrate moieties in receptor-active glycoconjugates and hence are also called fimbrial lectins. The targeted oligosaccharide chain may be present on an epithelial, a basement membrane, or a circulating macromolecule. Several fimbrial types are known to bind to both carbohydrate and proteinaceous targets. In the mannoside-binding FimH lectin of E. coli type 1 fimbria, binding to mannose chains of glycoproteins and to carbohydrate- or mannoside-free peptides involve different regions of the adhesive domain (Sokurenko et al., 1995, 1997; Pouttu et al., 1999; discussed below). In the globoside-binding P fimbriae of uropatho-

genic E. coli, however, binding to the globoside glycolipid is mediated by the PapG lectin situated at the filament tip (reviewed by Sauer et al., 2004) whereas binding of P fimbriae to human plasma and cellular fibronectins involves the other two minor tip-associated proteins, PapE and PapF (Westerlund et al., 1991). The Dr fimbria is exceptional in the sense that it binds, apparently via a mechanism not involving target oligosaccharides, to the decay accelerating factor (CD55) on the apical surfaces of epithelial cells and to type IV collagen of basement membranes (Nowicki et al., 1988; Westerlund et al., 1989). The diversity of adhesive and biological functions is well exemplified by the type 1 fimbriae of E. coli, which are defined by their binding to a-D-mannosides. Mannosides are common in oligosaccharide chains of mammalian glycoproteins, and this is reflected in the huge number of adhesive functions described for the type 1 fimbriae. The receptors for type-1 fimbriae include uroplakins on the apical surface of human urinary bladder epithelium (Wu et al., 1996), laminin of basement membranes (Kukkonen et al., 1993), the CD48 molecule on mouse macrophages (Baorto et al., 1997), a granulocyte membrane antigen (Sauter et al., 1991), the leukocyte adhesion molecules CD11 and CD18 (Gbarah et al., 1991), a human saliva glycoprotein (Babu et al., 1986), as well as the Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein of human urinary slime (Parkkinen et al., 1988). Type 1 fimbriae also bind to mannose-free proteins (Sokurenko et al., 1995, 1997) and have a role in self-aggregation of E. coli (Schembri et al., 2001). The biological functions of type 1 fimbriae include colonization of the intestinal surfaces in humans and animals and subsequent transmission of E. coli in the host population (Bloch et al., 1992) as well as colonization of human bladder during lower urinary tract infection (Hung et al., 2002). It appears that the filament, made up by the fimbrillins, is needed to extend the lectin subunit well beyond other surface structures of E. coli that might hinder adhesion. The filament also has biological functions of it own, e.g. it is bound by the circulating host protease precursor plasminogen. The plasminogen receptor function has been proposed to enhance and localize, in conjunction with fimbrial binding to basement membranes, plasmin proteolysis and to damage tissue barriers that prevent cellular migration (Lahteenmaki et al., 2001) ® ®

Structure of fimbrial lectin domains: a common scaffold supports different binding specificities
The three-dimensional structures of the fimbrial adhesins FimH, PapG, GafD, and DraE/AfaE have been resolved. These adhesins bind to different receptors and exhibit diversity in amino acid sequence and protein

folds, they also display different receptor-binding sites and disulfide bonding patterns in the carbohydratebinding domains. However, the overall structures of FimH, PapG, GafD are highly similar: the adhesin subunits consist of two domains connected by a flexible linker, and the N-terminal receptor-binding domains have adopted an elongated b-barrel jelly roll fold that contains the receptor-binding groove (Fig. 1A) This indicates that the fimbrial lectins are related by divergent evolution from a common scaffold. The type-1 fimbriae occur in about 80% of E. coli and other enterobacterial isolates, hence its FimH lectin may represent an ancestral fimbrial adhesin. The jelly roll fold offers a flexible scaffold for binding functions, and Merckel et al. (2003) presented a hypothesis of how the GlcNAcbinding GafD lectin domain could have evolved from the mannoside-binding FimH lectin domain. Two major changes were proposed: deletion of one b-strand and replacement of an a-helix in FimH. Differences in the carbohydrate-binding groove, which are critical for ligand specificity of the lectins, are discussed below. The structure of FimH was resolved first in complex with the FimC chaperone (Choudhury et al., 1999) and later in complex with D-mannose (Hung et al., 2002). FimH is 279 amino acids in length, the N-terminal amino acids Phe1 through Pro157 form the mannosidebinding lectin domain which is an elongated b barrel of 11 b strands and has a jelly roll-like topology. A short b hairpin at the beginning of the fold is not part of the jelly roll fold, and the 11th b strand that is inserted between the 3rd and 10th strands, breaks the jelly roll fold (Fig. 1A). The mannoside-binding pocket is located at the tip of the lectin domain distally from the fimbrillin domain. The C-terminal amino acids 160 through 279 constitute the fimbrillin domain that has an immunoglobulin-like topology and is involved in chaperone binding during fimbriae assembly as well as in anchoring the adhesin to the fimbrial filament. PapG binds to Gala1-4Gal-containing globoseries of membrane glycolipids. Three PapG alleles (I≠III) exist and bind with variable affinity to the different isoreceptors that differ in carbohydrate residues distal to the common Gala1-4Gal core. PapGII preferentially binds to globotetrasyl ceramide (GbO4) and is associated with human pyelonephritis; it is the most extensively studied P fimbrial adhesin allele (Stromberg ® et al., 1990). PapG is 316 amino acids in length and similarly to FimH, composed of an N-terminal receptorbinding domain and a C-terminal fimbrillin domain (Hultgren et al., 1989). The lectin domain of PapGII (196 amino acids in length) also is an elongated, mostly b sheet structure (Dodson et al., 2001; Sung et al., 2001) (Fig. 2B). Different from FimH, the lectin domain of PapG consists of two regions. The first one is composed of 7 b strands that form the jelly roll-like topology similar to that in FimH. The second region contains the

The PC31-FimH sequence (accession number P08191) was modeled against the coordinates of J96-FimH crystal structure (1KLF) using the Swiss-Model homology modeling server (http://www.expasy.org/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html), and the figures were drawn with the Swiss-Pdb viewer 3.7 (SP5) program. Two side views (A and B) are oriented differently to better show the marked residues. The lectin domain (top) and the fimbrillin domain (bottom) are connected by a short linker: (A) The amino acids involved in mannoside binding are indicated in red, and the residues forming the hydrophobic ridge that surrounds the binding pocket are colored purple.

The substitution Ser62Ala (in red) induces collagen binding, and changes in the variant that binds mono- and oligomannosides equally well are shown in purple (Phe175, Glu204). Amino acid changes in the variant that binds equally well to both mannoside types as well as to mannose-free fibronectin, are shown in pink (Glu73, Phe107).

receptor-binding site and is composed of a central antiparallell b sheet of six b strands flanked by two doublestranded b sheets on one side and an a helix on the other side. A large loop connects the a helix to one of the b strands within region 2 (Dodson et al., 2001). The N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-recognizing GafD lectin of the G fimbriae, associated with diarrhea and septicemia, is highly identical in amino acid sequence and receptor-binding specificity to the F17G adhesin of F17 fimbriae (Saarela et al., 1995). The threedimensional structure of the N-terminal receptor-binding domain of GafD was recently solved (Merckel et al.,

The coordinates of the crystal structures in the Swiss-Model homology server are GafD (1OIOA), PapGII (1J8R), and DraE (1USQ), and the figures were drawn with Swiss-Pdb viewer 3.7 (SP5) program. The side views are from different angles to better show the marked residues. Cysteines are colored yellow: (A) The amino acids that mediate the six side-chain bonds are in red, and residues in main-chain hydrogen bonds are in pink (Ala43, Gly119). In (B), residues colored red designate amino acids involved in direct polar interactions with the receptor carbohydrate, blue indicates amino acids participating in water-mediated interactions, and purple residues are aromatic or hydrophobic platforms. (C) Residues in red make contact with CD55, and the amino acids in purple are involved in Cm binding.

2003). The F17 lectin domain was reported independently and is highly similar to the GafD lectin domain (Buts et al., 2003). Like in FimH and PapG, also the GafD lectin domain (178 amino acids in length; Tanskanen et al., 2001) is ellipsoid and forms a b-barrel jelly roll-like topology involving 14 of the 16 b strands present in the GafD domain, strands 4 and 5 are excluded from the jelly roll, as well as a 310 helix (Fig. 2A). The receptor-binding site of GafD is located in the upper part of the molecule. The sequences of DraE, the adhesin and major structural subunit of Dr fimbriae, and AfaE, the receptor-binding molecule of the afimbrial adhesin Afa-III, are highly identical and only differ by three amino acid residues; interestingly, the proteins display partially differing receptor-binding specificities. DraE interacts with type IV collagen and CD55 in a chloramphenicol-sensitive manner (Westerlund et al., 1989; Nowicki et al., 1990; Van Loy et al., 2002) whereas binding of AfaE to CD55 is not affected by chloramphenicol (Cm) (Carnoy and Moseley, 1997). DraE and AfaE form oligomers when overexpressed, and X-ray structures of their trimeric forms are nearly identical and show an immunoglobulin-like topology resembling the fimbrillin domains of e.g. FimH and PapG, with two b sheets packed against each other (Fig. 2C) (Pettigrew

et al., 2004). The binding site for CD55 is located at one side of the molecule with the Cm-binding site in its vicinity, whereas the region of DraE that interacts with type IV collagen has not been structurally determined.

Structure of the receptor-binding sites in fimbrial adhesins
The interactions between adhesins and their natural ligands or ligand analogs have been solved at the atomic level in FimH, PapG, GafD, and DraE/AfaE. The mannoside-binding pocket at the distal tip of FimH was first shown to accommodate the molecule cyclohexylbutanoyl-N-hydroxyethyl-D-glucamide that is distantly related to mannoside (Choudhury et al., 1999). Later, it was shown that mannoside is buried in a deep and negatively charged pocket (see Fig. 1A) and involved in multiple interactions with the lectin (Hung et al., 2002). This unusually large interaction surface results in high affinity for D-mannose, which is important in the binding since presence of a terminal mannose on glycoproteins seems a prerequisite for sugar binding by FimH (Sokurenko et al., 1997). The amino acids of FimH involved in mannoside binding by hydrogen

bonding and hydrophobic interactions delineate the pocket and are located at the ends of the participating b strands or in the loops extending from them, Gln133 however is located within strand 10 (the residues are colored red in Fig. 1A). The affinity for D-mannose is further increased by a ridge of hydrophobic amino acids that surrounds the binding pocket (residues colored in purple in Fig. 1A). The ridge is apparently involved in directing the sugar into the pocket. Mutation of residues in the mannoside-binding site abolished FimH binding to erythrocytes and to human bladder epithelial cells (Hung et al., 2002), which confirms the importance of the identified FimH residues as well as the biological role of the mannoside binding. The conserved nature of the FimH binding pocket is supported by the finding that sequences in the FimH binding site are invariant in more than 200 uropathogenic E. coli strains (Hung et al, 2002). Point mutations at sites distal from the mannoside-binding pocket can result in lack of binding or even increased binding to mannoside (Fig. 1B) (Schembri et al., 2000; see discussion below), indicating that conformational changes in the lectin domain of FimH can influence the function of the pocket. On the other hand, binding of mannoside inhibits the FimH binding to type IV collagen that involves Ala62 distal to the mannosidebinding pocket, apparently by causing a conformational change in FimH (Fig. 1B) (Pouttu et al., 1999). The shallow globoside-binding site of PapGII is located at the side of the lectin-binding domain and formed by three b strands, an a helix and a loop connecting a fourth strand to the helix (Fig. 2B) (Dodson et al., 2001; Sung et al., 2001). Structural and mutational analyses have shown a repertoire of interactions between the lectin and GbO4, the interactions include direct polar and water-mediated interactions as well as contacts with aromatic and/or hydrophobic platforms (residues shown in red, blue and purple in Fig. 2B). The involvement in receptor binding of PapG of the amino acids Ser89, Glu90, Glu91, Asn92, Lys103, Gly104, Tyr105, Lys106, Trp107, Arg170, Lys172, and Tyr175 (see Fig. 2B) was inferred from structure analysis and confirmed by mutational analysis (Dodson et al., 2001). The tetrasaccharide GalNAcb1-3Gala1-4Galb14Glc of GbO4 binds to PapG in a V shape with the two Gal residues at the hinge of the V and the two other sugar moieties in the two branches. Structural studies of PapGII in the presence and absence of GbO4 revealed that binding of the tetrasaccharide causes only slight changes in side-chain conformation or backbone structure of the GbO4-binding pocket. Binding of GbO4 involves displacement of water molecules to make contact with Gala1-4Gal hydroxyls, and the interaction is of a rigid body type different from that of FimH that undergoes conformational changes upon receptor binding (Schembri et al., 2000; Dodson et al., 2001). The position of the binding site at one side of the PapG

molecule, the presence of charged residues in its vicinity, the location of PapG in the flexible fibrillum at the fimbrial tip as well as the structure of digalactoside ceramide (Pascher et al., 1992) suggest a model where the binding domain in PapGII is oriented parallel to the membrane of uroepithelial cells (Dodson et al., 2001). The GlcNAc-binding pocket that is located at the side above the equator of the lectin domain of the GafD adhesin (see Fig. 2A) resembles the binding pocket of PapGII in being an extended cleft. The binding site is formed by the C-terminal end of strand 6, the 310 helix, ( and strands 7, 8 and 9. The volume of the cleft is 329 A3, which is smaller than the D-mannoside-binding pocket ( of FimH (459 A3) but larger than the globoside-binding ( site of PapGII (284 A3) and is able to accommodate an additional monosaccharide. GafD interacts with GlcNAc by six side-chain and two main-chain hydrogen bonds (indicated in red and pink in Fig. 2A) as well as one water-mediated bond. The specificity for GlcNAc versus GalNAc and ManNAc is mediated by Thr117 and Asn44 that interact with the receptor by hydrogen bonds. Asp88 confers tight binding and Trp109 apparently positions the receptor into the cleft. A disulfide bond between Cys53 and Cys110 that apparently rigidifies the specificity pocket is present close to the binding site (Fig. 2A) (Merckel et al., 2003). The CD55-binding site in DraE/AfaE is located at the side of the molecule and forms a large convex surface involving seven b strands. The residues Asp61, Ile73 and Asn77 were shown by NMR and mutational analysis to be important for binding to CD55 (residues colored red in Fig. 2C) (Anderson et al., 2004). The Cm-binding site of DraE, on the other hand, is a hydrophobic pocket formed by the residues Gly113, Gly42, Pro40, and Pro43 at one end, Ile111 at the other end, and Tyr115 and Ile114 at the bottom of the pocket (residues colored purple in Fig 2C) (Pettigrew et al., 2004). Binding of Cm apparently disrupts the CD55-binding surface by covering the portion of the DraE surface that is involved in the binding to CD55. The Cm-binding site of DraE also is close to two of the three amino acids that differ in DraE and AfaE. In AfaE, the side chain of Met88 is located within the hydrophobic pocket that in DraE interacts with Cm, and Ile111, crucial for Cm binding by DraE, is substituted by Thr111 in AfaE (blue in Fig. 2C). Thus these small differences in structure may explain the variation in binding specificity between AfaE and DraE (Pettigrew et al., 2004). Two cysteine residues are present in the lectin domains of both FimH and PapGII, but disulfide bonds have not been shown in the crystal structures. The NMR report on PapG notes data consistent with a disulfide bond (Sung et al., 2001). Structure-based modeling of disulfide bonding makes it evident that the disulfide bonds occur near the receptor-binding pockets in FimH

and GafD, rigidify it and thereby allow tighter receptor≠lectin interaction (Merckel et al., 2003). In PapG, the disulfide bond probably is further away from the receptor-binding pocket but apparently stabilizes two of the b-strands that form the binding site, whereas the influence on receptor binding of the cysteines in DraE/AfaE remains unknown (Merckel et al., 2003; Anderson et al., 2004; Pettigrew et al., 2004).

References Conclusions
As discussed above in connection with Cm binding by the DraE/AfaE adhesins, minor sequence variation at critical sites in the adhesin domain can have significant effects on receptor binding. The three alleles of PapG show different preferences in binding to globoseries of glycolipids inserted in natural membranes, and this is reflected in host tropism of P-fimbriate E. coli (Stromberg et al., 1990). PapGI binds preferentially ® to globotriasylceramide (GbO3), PapGII to globotetrasylceramide (GbO4), and PapGIII to globopentasylceramide (GbO5). Modeling of PapGI and PapGIII sequences against the PapGII structure showed that the regions of PapGII interacting with the Gala1-4Gal core and GalNAc of GbO4 are conserved between PapGI and PapGII. However, the substitution Arg170His in PapGI was predicted to prevent binding to the Glc at the reducing end of GbO4, which, on the other hand, is required for PapGII binding (Dodson et al., 2001). On similar lines, differences between receptor-binding sites of PapGII and PapGIII mostly are in the region where the second GalNAc residue of GbO5 would be located, and this most likely explains the different receptor-binding by PapGII and PapGIII (Dodson et al., 2001). Type 1 fimbriae of E. coli exhibit a remarkable phenotypic variation in binding to mannose-containing as well as non-mannose receptors (Sokurenko et al., 1992). This variation in substrate preferences results from point mutations in fimH that lead to different affinities to monomannose and oligomannose structures as well as e.g. human fibronectin and type I and IV collagens (Sokurenko et al., 1995, 1997; Pouttu et al., 1999). The fimH changes are likely to enhance fitness of E. coli as a pathogen, hence the term pathoadaptive mutations (Sokurenko et al., 1999). Interestingly, mannose inhibits FimH binding to carbohydrate-free targets as well, and this likely results from conformational changes in FimH induced by mannose binding. Some examples of the pathoadaptive mutations are shown in Fig. 1B; it should be noted that the point mutations are scattered in different parts of FimH and that most of the recognized FimH phenotypes are not associated with a particular sequence motif in FimH.
