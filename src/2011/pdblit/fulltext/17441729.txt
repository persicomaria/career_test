ABSTRACT: Neurotensin (NT) is a 13-residue neuropeptide that exerts multiple biological functions in the central and peripheral nervous system. Little is known about the structure of this neuropeptide, and what is known only concerns its C-terminal part. We determined here for the first time the structure of the full-length NT in membrane-mimicking environments by means of classical proton-proton distance constraints derived from solution-state NMR spectroscopy. NT was found to have a structure at both its N and C termini, whereas the central region of NT remains highly flexible. In TFE and HFIP solutions, the NT C-terminus presents an extended slightly incurved structure, whereas in DPC it has a turn. The N-terminal region of NT possesses great adaptability and accessibility to the microenvironment in the three media studied. Altogether, our work demonstrates a structure of NT fully compatible with its NTRbound state.

Neurotensin (NT)1 is a 13-residue neuropeptide, pyroGlu1-Leu2-Tyr3-Glu4-Asn5-Lys6-Pro7-Arg8-Arg9-Pro10Tyr11-Ile12-Leu13, which exerts multiple biological functions such as neuroleptic-like effects, an influence on thermal regulation, reduction of locomotor activity and potentiation of alcohol in the central nervous system, and neuromodulation of the vascular and endocrine systems in the peripheral nervous system (1). The activities of NT are related to its binding with various affinities to different receptors (NTRs) belonging either to the superfamily of the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (NTR1 and 2) or to the family of sorting receptors (NTR3) (2). Various experiments using NTR antagonists, antisense inhibition of NTRs in the brain, or knockout mice indicate that most of the activity of NT results from its interaction with NTR1 (3-5). Interestingly, it has long been known that the six amino-acid C-terminal peptide fragment of neurotensin, NT(8-13), possesses all of the sequence requirements to bind with subnanomolar affinity to NTR1, as observed with the full-length peptide (6, 7). The functional role of
 NMR assignments and atomic coordinates for the converged structures have been deposited with the BioMagResBank (entry 15145) and the Protein Data Bank (entries 2OYV and 2OYW) respectively. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

the N-terminal region of NT remains to this date unclear. On the receptor side, mapping of the NT binding site indicates that the transmembrane domains 6 (TM6), 4 (TM4), and the third extracellular loop E3 seem to play a crucial role in NT recognition (8-10). Despite its clinical importance, very little is known regarding the structure of NT in interaction with NTRs. Progress in this field would provide insight into the function of NT and help in understanding the specificity of its binding to various receptors. Furthermore, such information is important in order to accelerate the development of novel molecules with great putative pharmacological interest. Various NMR methods can be used to address this question (11). However, unlike many other peptide hormones, few studies have examined the structure of NT using NMR. A first study showed that NT behaved as a flexible random coil in aqueous solution (12). Another study using SDS micelles investigated the structure of NT in environments that mimic the membrane; however, the binding of three cationic C-terminal residues of NT to the anionic sulfate head groups of micelles precluded any structure determination because of excessive line broadening on the 1H NMR spectra (13). More recently, Pang et al., using homology modeling of the C-terminal part of NT (NT 8-13) and the E3 loop, in conjunction with experimental data, proposed that NT adopts a compact conformation when bound to NTR with a proline type I turn in its Arg9-Ile12region (14). This was in contradiction with the model proposed by Barroso et al., who suggested that the NT(8-13)-bound peptide adopts a rather linear conformation (10), using a combination of NTR1 mutagenesis, pharmacology, and molecular modeling with frog rhodopsin as an NTR1 template. Finally, two studies used solid-state NMR-MAS (15) to investigate the interaction of the NT fragment NT(8-13)

NMR Solution Structure of Neurotensin with its receptor. Williamson et al. showed significant modifications in 13C chemical shifts of NT(8-13) upon binding to the receptor, which pointed to an important role of the NT C-terminus and the Tyr11 side chain for interaction with NTR, but they did not propose any structure (16). Luca et al., using a 13C chemical shift index for NT(8-13) upon receptor binding, suggested that NT undergoes a linear rearrangement to adopt a -strand conformation (17). Altogether, data are lacking on the structure of the fulllength NT in the membrane environment or bound to its receptor, thus underlining the need for additional investigations to better understand the structure of NT bound to its receptor. In the present work, we studied the conformation of fulllength NT using proton NMR in solution and molecular modeling in three structure-promoting media: trifluoroethanol (TFE), hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC). These solvents are known to favor the stabilization of preferred conformations in peptides and have been widely used to examine peptide conformation in such membrane-mimetic environments (18, 19). In particular, DPC micelles mimic the membrane environment by forming spherical aggregates where the polar headgroups are located on the surface and the hydrophobic tail in the core. The micelles are appropriate for high-resolution liquidstate NMR studies because they have a short rotational correlation time due to their small size (11). Furthermore, the peptide structure bound to DPC micelles could be quite close to that bound to unilamellar vesicles, which more closely resemble the biological membrane. For Rozek et al., this could be because of a less spherical shape with an axial ration of 1:6 and thus a curvature close to that of a liposome (20). In the three media tested, the N- and C-terminal parts of NT presented a partial structure, whereas a high degree of flexibility remained in the intermediate part. This may be critical for modulating the pluripotency of NT. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. Neurotensin was purchased from Bachem (4006469) and was used without any further purification. Deuterated TFE-d3, HFIP-d2, and DPC-d38 were purchased from Eurisotop (Saint Aubin, France). The NMR studies of NT conformation in TFE and HFIP were carried out with samples containing 1 mg of peptide dissolved in either of the following solvent mixtures: TFE or HFIP 80% and H2O 20%. To prepare samples in micelles, 1 mg of peptide was dissolved with 30 mg of DPC in 120 µL of a H2O/D2O (12:1) mixture (final peptide concentration 5 mM). The pH of the solution was 6.4. In these experimental conditions, the DPC concentration was higher than the critical micelle concentration and ensured a molar micelle/peptide ratio greater than 1:1, thus minimizing the peptide-peptide interaction at the micelle surface (21, 22). Spectroscopy Experiments. All of the 1H NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe, and the spectra were recorded with 1.7 mm NMR tubes. Data were processed using XWINNMR software (Bruker). Sodium [3-methylsilyl 2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate (TSP-d4) served as an internal reference for proton chemical shifts. NT spectra in HFIP/H2O (80:20) and in TFE/H2O (80: 20) were collected at 293 K and at 283 K in DPC micelles.

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 19, 2007 5657 For sequence-specific assignments, 2D TOCSY (23) and NOESY (24) spectra were used. The TOCSY experiments were performed with the DIPSI-2 sequence (25) with mixing times of 30, 50, and 70 ms in HFIP solution, and 75 ms in TFE solution and in DPC micelles. The NOESY experiments were acquired with a mixing time of respectively 100, 200, and 300 ms in HFIP, 200 and 300 ms in TFE, and in DPC micelles. All of the 2D experiments in TFE (80%) and HFIP (80%) were carried out with 2048 data points × 512 increments and a spectral width of 6614 Hz in both dimensions, 32 scans for NOESY, and 64 scans for TOCSY experiments. For neurotensin in DPC micelles, 2D experiments were carried out with 2048 data points × 512 increments × 144 scans and a spectral width of 7184 Hz in both dimensions. Water suppression was accomplished by presaturation during the relaxation delay or with a WATERGATE sequence (26). Temperature coefficients (/T) were obtained with 1D spectra recorded at 283, 288, 293, 298, 303, and 308 K. Molecular Modeling. Molecular modeling was conducted with the Accelrys software package. Simulated annealing and energy minimization were done with Discover and NMRRefine using the consistent-valence force field (cvff) model (27). Interproton distances were obtained from NOESY cross peaks by integrating intensities at 300 ms mixing time and calibrating the intensities using the NOEs between the -methylene protons of prolines (28). The NOE-distance constraints between two protons were estimated using a relation of the Braun model for short flexible peptides (29). To take spin diffusion and internal motion into account, distance constraints were classified into four categories of upper-distance limits rather than as strict constraints. Cross peaks were divided into strong, medium, weak, and very weak classes, corresponding to upper limits of 2.7, 3.3, 5.0, and 6.0 Å, respectively (30). Pseudoatoms were used for nonstereospecifically assigned protons, and the limits were adjusted using standard pseudoatom corrections (31). Structure Calculations. Simulation annealing calculations involved 15 separate phases. The first phase involved 100 steps of randomization and minimization of the starting structure into the steepest-descent algorithm. The second phase involved additional minimization into 500 iterations of the conjugate gradient algorithm. Dynamic phases 3-5 involved simulated annealing for 30, 10, and 10 ps, respectively, at 1000 K. Meanwhile, the force constants were increased stepwise up to their full values. Phases 6-10 involved cooling of the molecule from 1000 to 300 K over 2 ps. Phases 11 and 12 involved minimization using 100 steps of the steepest-descent algorithm followed by 500 iterations of the conjugate gradient. Then, minimization phases 13 and 14, with a distance-dependent dielectric constant to mimic the solvent effect, involved 100 steps of a steepest descent followed by 1500 iterations of a conjugate gradient. Finally, the last phase involved 1500 steps of a steepest-descent algorithm with the distance-dependent dielectric constant but without the NMR constraints in order to improve the molecular relaxation. One hundred structures of low total energy were calculated using the experimental distances determined from NOE spectra. From these, we discarded the structures with (i) violations of the distance restraint above 0.5 Å, (ii) 2 or more violations per molecule, and (iii) backbone dihedral angles

out of the peptide range in the Ramachandran plot. Structural statistics for the converged structures were then evaluated in terms of root mean square deviations (rmsd). Finally, the validity of structures was controlled by Procheck analysis (32). RESULTS The complete sequence-specific proton assignment of the NT protons was carried out using the standard technique developed by Wuthrich (31) and the NMR assignment and ¨ integration software Sparky (33) (Table 1). The 1H NMR spectra did not reveal the detectable presence of various conformers arising from the cis/trans isomerization of the two proline residues at positions 7 and 10. Both prolines were found in the trans configuration as determined from the observation in the NOESY spectra of the strong HR(i, i + 1) NOE cross peaks between each proline residue and the preceding amino acid. For all of the studies, the temperature coefficient values (< -3ppb/K) for amide protons showed the absence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (34). In the three solvent systems studied, the NOESY spectra showed a fairly large number of short- and medium-range NOEs restricted mainly to residues in the N- and C-terminal

regions, indicating partial conformational stabilization in these parts of the peptide (Table 2). Noticeably, NOEs typical of R-helices were observed in none of the three solvents (31), in agreement with secondary structure prediction (35) and despite the fact that these media are R-helix stabilizers. By contrast, characteristic cross peaks of a type I turn were observed in DPC micelles over residues Pro10-Leu13, that are, dNN(i, i + 1), dNN(i, i + 2), dRN(i, i + 1), dRN(i, i + 2), and dRN(i, i + 3) (31) (Figure 1). However, the chemical shift index (CSI) values of HR indicated that NT did not present a clearly defined secondary structure (36). Differences in CSIs of amide protons between alcohol and micelles were, on the contrary, striking (Figure 2) and might reflect different solvent exposure of amides in the three media. Structure calculations provided families of 14, 15, and 14 structures in, respectively, HFIP, TFE, and DPC micelles (Figure 3). Superimposition of the backbone atoms showed that the structure of the N-terminal part (residues 2-5) was stabilized in the three media (Table 2). In TFE and DPC, this region presented an extended structure over Leu2-Asn5 with an rmsd value equal to 0.59 and 0.71 Å, respectively, whereas it had a bent structure in HFIP with rmsd ) 0.42 Å (Figure 3A). In the C-terminal region, the sequence Arg8Ile12 presented in both alcohols an extended structure, slightly

curved in HFIP and in TFE, with rmsd values equal to 0.47 and 0.58 Å, respectively. In DPC micelles, a bent structure close to a type I turn (37) was observed over the Pro10-Leu13 region that followed the Arg8-Arg9 sequence in extended conformation (rmsd ) 0.36 Å) (Figure 3B). Comparison of the mean structures in both alcohol solvents showed a superimposition of the backbone atoms with an rmsd value equal to 0.71 Å for the Arg8-Ile12 region, with a similar spatial orientation of the side chains (Figure 4). The intermediate part, Lys6-Pro7, is found to be flexible owing to the rather high rmsd values (1.71, 3.11, and 1.89 Å) when we tried to superimpose the Leu2-Ile12 structures (Table 2). This flexibility was in agreement with the lack of NOE cross peaks in this central part and indicated that the conformational stabilization at both termini (sequences 2-5 and 8-12) occurred independently with no long-range interaction between these two regions. DISCUSSION NT is an endogenous peptide neurotransmitter that is widely distributed in the nervous system and influences various central and peripheral functions in mammals. NT is widely thought to exert these activities mainly through interaction with two G-protein coupled receptors, NTR1 and NTR2. To date, little is known at the molecular level as to how full-length NT interacts with its main receptor, NTR1.

The only available data are conflicting and concern the bound conformation of the C-terminal NT(8-13) peptide fragment. Owing to the broad-range in vivo effects of NT, and because the N-terminal part of NT may influence the overall NT-bound structure and specificity of its interaction with different receptors, we investigated the solution structure of the full-length NT by means of 2D-NMR spectroscopy in three media able to mimic the membrane environment (two alcohol solvents and DPC micelles). In these media, NT was found to present a global organization with both the N and

C termini structured, whereas a high degree of flexibility remained in its central part. Structure of the C-Terminal Region of Neurotensin. Previous structure investigations of NT essentially concerned the C-terminal hexapeptide (Arg8-Leu13) because it was shown that this region was sufficient for receptor binding and function (6, 7). Structural information regarding this region has thus been reported in three papers with proposals to account for the putative NT-/NTR-bound conformation (10, 14, 17). Two studies were conducted in the absence of experimental structural data and led to two opposite conclusions. The first proposed a compact bent conformation, which was based on de novo tertiary predictions of the structure of the NTR putative NT binding site coupled with receptor and ligand mutagenesis experiments (14). The second study concluded that this region adopted a linear structure. These results were derived from a model of NTR1 constructed with rhodopsin as a template, combined with mutagenesis and structure-activity relationship experiments (10). A recent

study indicated that the NT(8-13) fragment bound to NTR1 presented a -strand conformation based on 13C chemical shift index analyses of the bound peptide by HR-MAS NMR and uniformly 13C and 15N labeled NT(8-13) in the presence of functional NTR1 reconstituted into lipid vesicles (17). In this work, we show that in two different alcohol solvents (TFE and HFIP), full-length NT had, for the same C-terminal residues, an extended though slightly bent structure (Figures 3 and 4) that is very similar to the one found in the solid state for the NT(8-13) bound to the receptor. In a -strand conformation, as proposed by Luca et al. (17), the side chains of three functionally important residues (Arg9, Tyr11, and Leu13) of NT (9, 10, 14) are on the same side of the backbone (Figure 5A). In the solution structures (TFE and HFIP) of this work, the same key residues are also located on a -strand, and their side chains are oriented in space by the same side of the extended backbone as in the complex (Figure 5A,B). Thus, the conformations observed in both alcohols are likely to be close to the active structure of NT bound to NTR1. In fact, our structure is close to that proposed by Luca et al. (17) except for the Pro10 (, ) values, which differ notably from those we found in solution (Table 3). This difference might be due to the different methods used: Luca and co-workers deduced the (, ) values from CR and C chemical shifts using TALOS, whereas our values were derived from an exhaustive set of NOE distance constraints. More particularly, however, a  value of ca. -147 does not seem realistic for a proline residue even under the constraints associated to receptor binding and is not in the range of values found for proline residues in highresolution crystal structures of proteins ( Pro average value ) -66 ( 10 in 46 high-resolution crystal structures of proteins) (38). Importantly, the (, ) dihedral angle values of Pro10 in this study, and more specifically the  value, are in agreement with the allowed regions of proline residues shown in Procheck (32). Finally, our results validate the model of Barroso et al. (10). Though structure elucidation in the absence of the receptor may appear at first glance to provide only limited insight into the bioactive conformation, there is emerging evidence because of the work of Schwyzer (39) and it is in agreement with the two-step ligand transportation theory (40) that

peptide/membrane interactions are mandatory for receptor recognition (41, 42). Accordingly, bioactive peptides are thought to encounter and bind first to the membrane in a nonspecific manner, then to migrate and bind specifically to their cognate receptors by 2D diffusion on the membrane surface. It thus appears that the membrane may assist or prepare binding to the receptor by locking the peptide into a bioactive shape and that this two-step binding sequence could be kinetically more advantageous than a single-step binding scheme. Thus, NT structure was also studied in DPC micelles because this solvent closely mimics the biological membrane and is compatible with high-resolution NMR studies (11). A bent structure close to a type I turn was observed in the C terminus, from Pro10 to Leu13, with  and  values of -76 ( 5 and -35 ( 8° for Tyr11 and -71 ( 6 and -18 ( 7° for Ile12. This folded conformation in DPC micelles was different from the extended structure found in TFE and HFIP, suggesting that the hydrophobic side-chains of the turn established interactions with the micelles. In the case of NT(8-13) and assuming that the two-step ligand transportation theory is valid, the conformational changes needed to pass from the bound-micelle molecule (turn) to the bound-receptor peptide (extended) require modifications in the main chain torsional angles of only two residues, Tyr11 and Ile12. Thus, the energy cost to change to the bound-receptor conformation could be compensated by the energy benefit that could occur from intermolecular contacts in the receptor (Figure 5). This hypothesis agrees with a recent study where the conformation of pituitary adenylate cyclase polypeptide (PACAP) was determined, bound to its specific receptor and to DPC micelles (42). The conformational changes for the bioactive N-terminal region (residues 1-7) needed to pass from the bound-micelle molecule (N-terminal disordered 1-4 and R-helix 5-7) to the bound-receptor peptide (N-terminal extended segment 1-3 and -coil 4-7) require modifications in the main-chain torsional angles of PACAP residues 4, 6, and 7. Thus, our explanation for the NT conformational rearrangement is in agreement with this study. Structure of the N-Terminal Region of Neurotensin. This study is the first to investigate the structure of full-length NT. Whereas previous studies focused on the structure of the C-terminal NT(8-13) fragment that binds with high affinity to the receptor (10, 14, 17), nothing is known of the structure of the N-terminal part of NT (residues 1-7). This part may, however, play a role in the overall structure, modulate the interactions of NT with its partners, influence NT receptor specificity, or be directly involved in some biological effects (43). In fact, Pang et al. showed a significant modification of binding-constant value when they compared NT(8-13) and full-length NT (14). The structure of NT(2-5) was found to be similar in TFE solvent and

DPC micelles showing an extended conformation, whereas it presented a turn in HFIP solution. These results suggest (i) a great adaptability of the N-terminal region to the environment because two different conformations with different spatial arrangements of side chains were obtained in both alcohol solvents with relatively close physicochemical properties and (ii) a great accessibility because the finding of similar structures in TFE and DPC micelles indicated that this region did not seem to participate in interactions with micelles and was thus accessible to the solvent (Figure 2, amide protons). Moreover, the weaker stabilization of the NT(2-5) structure in DPC micelles as deduced from the rmsd value (rmsd2-5 ) 0.71 Å) as compared to that in both alcohol solvents (rmsd2-5 ) 0.42 Å in HFIP and 0.59 Å in TFE) is in favor of this hypothesis. Altogether, the adaptability and the solvent accessibility of the N terminus of neurotensin are associated with the high degree of flexibility observed between the N- and C-terminal parts of NT. Such a flexible linker may allow the N-terminal part to either interact with different partners or participate in receptor specificity. Recently, Heise et al. developed an argument against the idea of a conformational stabilization of NT in structurepromoting solvents (44). This argument does not seem to hold because we report here experimental evidence of the conformational stabilization of the two terminal regions of full-length NT in different solvent systems. The different conclusions in these two studies might be partly explained by the different approaches used. Heise et al. mainly used a theoretical method based on molecular dynamic simulations and CR and C chemical shifts translated into conformational parameters, whereas we used the classical solution-state NMR with proton-proton NOEs as structural data and simulated annealing structure calculations. However, definite solution structures for a peptide such as NT have to be considered as the average of structures in fast conformational exchange rather than preferred unique conformations (11). Clearly, in the solvents used here, the NT molecules appear to be mostly distributed in a restricted number of structural populations with defined structures in the C- or N-terminal regions. Interestingly, the average C-terminal structure of NT in both alcohols is close to the one observed for the receptorbound C-terminal fragment (17) and can be therefore considered related to the bioactive, receptor-bound structure. In conclusion, we present for the first time a structure of full-length NT compatible with its receptor-bound state obtained by the standard approach using proton-proton distance constraints derived from solution NMR and molecular modeling. Our results provide a structural model that will contribute to the fundamental knowledge of the NT interaction with its receptors and will provide insights into ligand/receptor recognition in the superfamily of the G-
