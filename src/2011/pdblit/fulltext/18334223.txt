Abstract Gelation was observed by time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering and rheology on 10 mg/ml Ca-alginate gels prepared by in situ release of Ca 2 from CaEGTA or CaCO3 with total Ca 2 concentration in the range 10­20 mM. This was carried out for alginates having a fraction of a-l-GulA (G) of FG  0:39 and 0.68, respectively, obtained by the selection of alginates isolated from two different brown algae, Ascophyllum nodosum and Laminaria hyperborea stipe. Correlation between the rheological data and SAXS data shows that a large fraction of the lateral association precedes the formation of a continuous network through the sample cell. Following the initial association of chain segments in junction zones, the analysis using twocomponent broken rod model indicates the formation of larger bundles, and that the relative weight of these bundles increases with increasing time. The molecular model for the bundles is proposed by associating 2­16 units (G-blocks) composed of 14 1 3 4 linked residues of a-l-GulA in parallel according to the available crystallographic data. The storage modulus increases as the bundles composed of associated alginate chains grow during the gel formation. The gel elasticity is mainly sustained by single chains in the alginate sample with a low fraction of a-l-GulA. The alginates with a high fraction of a-l-GulA associate into thicker bundles which join to form a network. Here the gel elasticity seems to be due to the flexible joints between bundles, since the fraction of single chains is extremely low. 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Alginates are widely applied in the field of food and pharmaceutical industries, because gelation can be introduced with ease for this family of marine copolysaccharides. Added to this, are the alginates with different fraction and sequences of the two comprising sugar residues, 1 3 4 linked residues of b-d-ManA (M) and a-l-GulA (G), available by selection of algi* Corresponding author. 0022-2860/00/$ - see front matter PII: S0022-286 0(00)00556-1

nates from different seaweed or parts of a given seaweed species [1]. Ionotropic gelation of alginate is conventionally described in the terms of the `egg-box' model where divalent cations such as Ca 2 are envisaged to be coordinated to guluronic acid cavities made by pairing up of guluronic acid sequences within the alginate chains. In the preceding paper [2], the structure of homogeneous Ca-alginate gels was studied by employing a combination of rheology and smallangle X-ray scattering. The primary aim of that

study was to determine the dimensions of the junction zones in Ca 2 induced alginate gels, and hence, the number of laterally associated guluronic acid sequences of the junction zones. The results indicated an increase in the number of the laterally associated chains for a given [Ca 2 ] among the samples selected from different sources with increasing fraction of G, FG. Furthermore, the data confirmed that the lateral dimensions of the junction zones increased with the fraction of Ca-saturated GulA within the samples. The focus in this paper is placed on the kinetics of homogeneous gelation of alginate aqueous solutions for some of the samples studied in the preceding paper [2]. The gelation of the well-characterized samples is

performed by in situ release of the Ca 2 ions from CaEGTA analogous to that used in the preceding paper [2]. The gelation kinetics were monitored both by the viscoelastic measurements and the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), where the viscoelastic property changes continuously and the size of the junction zones develops consistently as Ca 2 induces the formation of the junction zones. By correlating the size of the junction zone with the rheological properties, in particular the shear storage modulus, G H , the developing network structure can be characterized. This is carried out for alginate samples with different FG and thereby we will be able to elucidate common features of the structural development of the gelation in these cases.

2. Materials and methods Two alginate samples, LoG230 and HiG160, were adopted for the time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering observation. The chemical composition and intrinsic viscosity ([h ] in 0.1 M NaCl at 20 C) of those samples were determined by high-field 1H NMR [3] and viscometry as summarized in Table 1. Here LoG and HiG denote the low and high fractions of a-l-GulA, respectively, and the subscripts the molecular weight ( × 10 3) calculated from respective [h ] according to the Mark­Houwink equation. The preparation of the homogeneous alginate gels by in situ release of Ca 2 from CaEGTA and CaCO3 and rheological determination of gelation kinetics are described in details in the preceding paper [2]. Timeresolved SAXS was observed from gelling solutions by using the synchrotron radiation X-ray source with the SAXES equipment installed at BL-10C in Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. The optic system of the SAXES equipment and the measuring procedure will be found elsewhere [4]. The appropriate times for SAXS measurements were selected based on the gelation kinetics determined by the dynamic oscillatory tests. The SAXS data were accumulated for 10 min at each point to ensure reasonable signal-tonoise ratio for the data and at the same time avoid potential degradation associated with extended exposure of the same sample due to multiple observations. The storage and loss moduli were monitored during the gelling process at 20 C at a fixed frequency of v  6:28 rad s 1 with intervals of 3 min. The Bohlin VOR was employed with a serrated plate­plate sample cell and a torsion bar with a stiffness of 4 g cm for the measurements. The samples were sealed with lowdensity, low viscosity silicon oil to avoid adverse effects associated with evaporation of solvent throughout the gelation experiments.

inducing gelation for these samples were similar to that for the examples shown in Fig. 1 of the preceding paper [2] (data not shown). The rheological data show that G H for gelling solutions increases by at least two order of magnitudes while G HH generally only shows a smaller, if any, increase. This clearly indicates the change from a viscoelastic liquid to a viscoelastic gel. The gelation kinetics is characterized by nearly negligible changes in G H during an initial stage. The duration of this initial stage depends on the alginate source and is probably a reflection of the content of guluronic acid in the samples, FG, as well as the time required to release sufficient Ca 2 from CaEGTA or CaCO3. This initial plateau is followed by a rather rapid increase in G H during the subsequent 60­ 120 min, and a leveling off to a nearly constant plateau value after about 5 h. For the discussion of the correspondence of the final plateau value of G H to the chemical composition of alginate, [Ca 2 ], refer the preceding paper [2].

3.2. Time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering Time-resolved SAXS was observed from the gelling systems in order to determine the correlation between the dimensional changes occurring on the length scale observed by SAXS and the gel elasticity determined by rheological methods. Fig. 2 shows scattering profiles at selected intervals after inducing gelation for alginate from LoG230 (a) and HiG160 (b) with Ca2   10 mM: Here the scattering profiles are shown on the double-logarithmic scales to enhance the differences occurring in the high q region. Corresponding rheological data are shown in Fig. 1. Note that the accumulation time (10 min) for collecting scattering data implies that the observed scattering profiles represent an average over this time, whereas the duration of the rheological data collection is much less. The scattering profiles show a smooth transition from a behavior similar to that for the uncrosslinked chains to a state similar to that observed for the gels not subjected to the time-resolved studies. The scattering profiles of the time-resolved series were decomposed into two cylindrical components specified by the cross-sectional radii R1 and R2, respectively, in terms of the broken rod model [5]. That is, the total scattering intensity I(q) is given in

cross-sectional radius of the cylinder. The constant term k3 is introduced to take into account the random spatial correlation between the components. J1 is the Bessel function of first kind and order 1, which is 2 approximately proportional to q 1exp( q 2RGc/2) with RGc being the cross-sectional radius of gyration at qr 1 as expected from the Guinier approximation for a rod-like molecule. Eq. (1) implies that the flexible polysaccharide chains provide the elastic

connections between the junction zones represented by two components of rigid cylinders. Although the junction zones could be polydisperse with regard to their sizes, we restrict the number of components to two cylinders for the computational convenience. Two cylinders of different cross-sectional radii are supposed to represent all junction zones in the alginate gels as a kind of averages. At the initial stage of inducing gelation, the

shoulder due to the electrostatic interaction was observed in the small-angle X-ray scattering profiles. The shoulder disappears after 50­100 min, and this time is considered to correspond to the duration required for the release of sufficient Ca 2 . A similar tendency was observed in the viscoelastic measurements as nearly negligible changes in G H in the initial stage. Fig. 3 shows the examples of fitting with the two-component model according to Eq. (1). The examples were selected to show the initial stage (the situation prior to the onset of G H ) and after the steepest change in G H of the rheological data. Here the electrostatic interaction in the initial stage was taken into account by multiplying the right side of Eq. (1) by the interaction term S(q) [6] which is approximately written as Sq 1 1 C exp j 2 q2  3

where C is a constant depending on the second virial

coefficient and the polymer concentration, and j the correlation length of interaction specifying the Gaussian decay of interaction [7]. Generally, the twocomponent model accounted for the scattering profiles both prior to the onset of the large change in G H and at the high plateau value of G H . This was found for all alginates subjected to the time-resolved SAXS studies. However, no larger components seem to be present in the initial stage of Ca 2 induced gelation in both systems of HiG and LoG alginate aqueous solutions, while the interference effect due to electrostatic interaction is observed in the SAXS profiles. The electrostatic interaction may prevent a further lateral association of guluronic acid sequences from forming the junction zones. That is, a larger component is responsible for the network formation in Ca-alginate systems, and a smaller component is considered to reflect mostly alginate chains not incorporated in the junction zone. The estimated parameters for the best-fit models

(Tables 2 and 3) show that there is an increase both in the radius of both cylinder components and in the fraction of a larger component as gelation proceeds. The comparison of the development of the model parameters between different alginates shows that the cylindrical dimension of this model depends on the alginate source. Both components appear to have a smaller radius for the sample with smaller FG (Tables 2 and 3). Here the increase of the radius is less marked in a smaller cylinder component, which reaches ° almost a saturated value of about 6 A at the onset of a larger component. A larger cylinder component increases its cross-sectional radius consistently with time, but its radius in LoG ° never exceeds 20 A. This corresponds to the upper limit of the dynamic modulus G H (160 Pa) in LoG alginate. In order to avoid the ambiguity due to the artifact of the two-component model analysis, the mean cross-sectional radius Rav was calculated as R av  w1 R1 w2 R2 4

as summarized in Tables 2 and 3 where wi denotes the weight fraction of the component i given by Eq. (2). As discussed later, Rav shows a good correlation with the dynamic modulus G H . The distance distribution function provides information on the spatial correlation between a pair of points in alginates. The calculated distance distribution functions, p(r), by direct Fourier inversion of the scattering profiles [8] show that initially there is a  peak centered around r  25 A followed by a long tail of low intensity (Fig. 4). Such a p(r) is similar to that observed for gellan gum at a temperature sufficiently high to yield the disordered form [9]. Following the induction of the Ca 2 -mediated formation of junction zones, p(r) changes throughout the reaction by showing a relative increase in the region r   75­250 A: Thus, the maximum around r  25 A becomes less pronounced as the gelation proceeds. Also prominent is that the developing p(r) is rather broad, indicating that there is a broad distribution of domain sizes that are developing. These distribution functions also support the adoption of a model for junction zones consisting of more than one

component. A good fit observed for the two-component representation of the junction zones indicates that this is a sufficient extension of the 1-component model to account for the scattering data, but nevertheless, a broader distribution could also be expected to account for the data. Comparison of the families of p(r) for the timeresolved studies between the alginate samples reveals no assessment for the structural differences between

them. The reason for this is that the comparison was made on p(r) between different alginate samples under gelation with the same G H of the 10 mg/ml gelling solutions, or the same fractional increase in G H relative to the final G H of the sample. The overall network structure is thus considered to be common to the Ca 2 -induced alginate gels from different sources. Adding to this, is the change in G H occurring over the accumulation time of each of the SAXS data sets.

3.3. Correlation between developing junction zone parameters and gel elasticity Fig. 5 shows the correlation between the mean cross-sectional radius Rav (see Eq. (4)) and the storage modulus of alginate gels. Here the correlation between Rav and G H is described by a common relationship regardless of the origin of alginate samples. The data show that there is an increase in Rav and G H after the induction period corresponding to a junction ° zone multiplicity of 2. Rav increases from 5 to 7 A while G H v  6:28 s 1  is less than about 100 Pa. This region corresponds to the appearance of the second component in the two-component model and indicates that a substantial lateral dimerization takes place prior to formation of macroscopic network. The time-resolved SAXS profiles of alginate L. hyperborea stipe (HiG160), were as a first approximation, quantified by assuming two major average junction zone multiplicities that are contributing to the observed scattering. Fig. 5 (the correlation between the mean cross-sectional radius and the storage modulus) indicates that the increase in G H above 200 Pa is associated with rather large dimensional

changes in the junction zones. This may indicate that the gelation proceeds by first forming junction zones made up by pairing guluronic sequences, and then by either way that such pairs associate further to form junction zones of twice the multiplicity, or that unpaired sequences associate to already formed junction zones. The increase in the junction zone multiplicity is observed as the thickening of the cylinder component in the model analysis. In this region, the storage modulus G H is linearly proportional to the mean cross-sectional radius Rav as Rav  6:2 0:006G H 5

Eq. (5) implies that the number of active network chains is proportional to the mean cross-sectional ° radius Rav that should exceed 6 A to form the junction zones capable of an elastic network. Comparison of the correlation between Rav and G H between LoG230 and HiG160, suggests that the initial gelation is characterized by the development of similar mean Rav at a given elasticity. This is seen as the near universal behavior of the Rav ­G H correlation for G H 100 Pa: Subsequently, the gelation of the two different alginates follow different paths in the

Rav ­G H correlation. Almost constant Rav was observed for the A. nodosum source (LoG230) from 13 h on onwards after start of gelation where G H never exceeds 170 Pa. The L. hyporborea stipe source (HiG160) exhibits a consistent increase in both Rav and G H with time, where the increase in Rav is mostly due to the thickening of the larger component in the two-component model. Thus the junction zone is supposed to be formed by lateral association of available guluronic acid sequences, and it seems that the degree of lateral association depends on the fraction of guluronic acid sequences. 3.4. Consistency of the broken rod model in view of the molecular model for the junction zone The molecular model was built on the crystallographic data, where oligogluronates of 24 residues (DP  24) are aligned laterally to form a junction zone. The scattering from the molecular models is shown in Fig. 6 for the junction zone composed of 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 oligogluronates. The observed SAXS profiles are decomposed into two components

radius of the ith atom, respectively. Since the electronic interaction is present in the initial stage of Ca 2 release, Eq. (3) was adapted to account for the interference peak appeared in the scattering profiles. The results are summarized in Tables 4 and 5,

and shown in Fig. 7 where two components comprise a single oligo-b-d-ManA chain (Mblock) and either of the associated oligo-a-lGulA chains (G-block) specified by the molecular models in Fig. 6. Two characteristic features will emerge from the molecular model fittings. The

degree of association never exceeds eight Gblocks in the low-G-fraction sample LoG230, where the fraction of M-block single chains remains 1/3 in steady state. The elasticity of this sample is thus mainly sustained by single chains incorporated in the network composed of G-block associates and single chains. On the contrary, HiG160 exhibits a consistent increase of the degree of G-block association, where the single chain fraction becomes less and less with time. As the dynamic modulus G H increases consistently, the elastic behavior seems to be governed more or less by the flexible joints of G-block associated bundles when considered the high rigidity of the associated G-blocks. The transition of the elastic behavior is observed as a break point of G H plotted against the mean cross-sectional radius (Fig. 5).
