ABSTRACT: FixJ is a response regulator of the two-component signal transduction pathway involved in the transcriptional activation of nitrogen fixation genes of Sinorhizobium meliloti. Upon phosphorylation, FixJ transcriptionally activates the fixK and nifA promoters. We identified a FixJ recognition sequence of 16 bp in the high affinity binding site of the fixK promoter by means of a gel shift assay. In addition, the solution structure of the truncated C-terminal DNA binding domain of FixJ (FixJC) was solved by NMR spectroscopy. FixJC contains five R-helices that encode a typical helix-turn-helix motif as a potential DNA binding core with the highest structural similarity toward the C-terminal DNA binding domain of NarL. The addition of the DNA fragment containing the recognition sequence of the high affinity FixJ binding site resulted in intermediate to slow exchange interactions on the NMR time scale in the spectrum of FixJC, while the exchange was rapid in the case of control DNA. These spectral data suggest that more than one molecule of FixJC binds to the recognition sequence, although FixJC alone is present in monomeric form in solution. This result is consistent with a scenario in which a transcriptionally active species of FixJ is a homodimer of the phosphorylated form.

Rhizobial FixL and FixJ proteins have been genetically identified as oxygen-sensing components that direct the expression of genes that are involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation in hypoxic root nodules in host plants (1). The nucleotide sequence indicates that they are a sensory histidine kinase, along with its cognate response regulator, and are members of the superfamily of bacterial two-component signal transducing systems. At low oxygen tension, oxygenfree FixL is autophosphorylated by ATP at an invariant histidine residue, and the phosphoryl group is transferred to a conserved Asp residue of FixJ, while the oxygen-bound form reduces the histidine kinase activity at high oxygen tension (2). FixJ consists of an N-terminal receiver domain and a C-terminal effector domain. The acceptance of the phosphoryl group at Asp54 of the receiver domain from FixL enhances its transcriptional activator function, i.e., the DNA binding ability of the effector domain toward the promoter

regions of the target genes, fixK and nifA (3, 4). Since FixJC1 exhibits binding to these promoters, the unphosphorylated N-terminal receiver domain appears to exert an inhibitory effect within the full-length protein, which is relieved upon phosphorylation and concomitant dimerization (5, 6). Because of the high similarity in the amino acid sequence of FixJC with the C-terminal DNA binding region of another response regulator, NarL (7) (Figure 1), the DNA binding of FixJ is thought to be similar to that of NarL. However, the mechanisms by which their DNA binding domains are activated remain to be elucidated at an atomic resolution. The C-terminal domain of FixJ is expected to contain an HTH motif similar to NarL and Spo0A, although the DNA sequences of the target promoters are different from each other (8, 9). Thus, another issue to be solved is how the individual response regulators recognize their own target promoters. It is also noteworthy that the nifA and fixK promoters share no sequence homology, and neither significant tandem nor palindromic sequences are present in these promoters (10) although the dimeric form of phosphorylated FixJ binds to them (6). Such differences in DNA sequence between the two promoters suggest that phosphorylated FixJ binds to these promoters but that the nature of the binding is unique for each promoter. However, no structural evidence for this has yet been reported.

In the present study, we identified the essential sequence of the fixK promoter for FixJ binding and determined the solution structure of FixJC, in an attempt to understand the binding interaction between the promoter and FixJC using NMR spectroscopy. The results suggest that two molecules of the active FixJ species synergistically bind in a specific and nonspecific manner with a rather low binding affinity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Gel Shift Assay of the FixJ-fixK Promoter Complex. Preparation of the FixJ protein and its phosphorylation with acetyl phosphate were carried out as previously described (11). The FixJ-DNA complexes were formed by incubating 15 µM FixJ and 0.33 µM DNA in 89 mM Tris borate pH 8.0, 2 mM Na-EDTA, 1.7 mM MgCl2 at room temperature for 30 min. Fifteen microliter aliquots of the solution were applied to a 10% polyacrylamide gel in 89 mM Tris borate pH 8.0, 2 mM Na-EDTA. The electrophoresis was carried out at 50 V × 3.3 h in the cold (4 °C). The DNAs separated in the gels were visualized using a GelStar stainer (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications). Expression and Protein Purification of FixJC for NMR Experiments. For the expression of FixJC, the DNA corresponding to Asp130-Ser204 accompanied by the NdeI and BamHI sites was subcloned into pET-14b (Novagen), and the resulting expression plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli strain JM109 (DE3). Uniformly 13C/15N labeled FixJC protein was obtained by growing the transformed bacteria at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium containing 0.5 g/L 15NH4Cl and 2 g/L [13C6] D-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. At an OD600 nm of 0.8, protein expression was induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM. After 4 h of further growth at 37 °C, the cells were harvested, washed, and stored at -80 °C. All the purification procedures described below were carried out at 4 °C. The cell pellet was suspended in buffer A [50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM -ME, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF]. Lysis was performed by two passages of a French press after lysozyme treatment (0.1 mg/mL). The cell debris was clarified by centrifugation at 64000g for 60 min. The 6xHistag FixJC was purified by chromatography on a Ni-NTA affinity column (QIAGEN). Cleavage of the 6xHis-tag was achieved by thrombin digestion, followed by passage of the solution through the Ni-NTA to remove the cleaved tag. FixJC-containing fractions were then loaded onto a CMSepharose fast flow cation exchange column preequilibrated with buffer B [20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM -mercaptoethanol] and eluted using a NaCl gradient. The final FixJC fractions

were collected and concentrated. This FixJC sample has four vector-derived extra residues (GlySerHisMet) at the Nterminal of the protein. NMR Spectroscopy. Purified 13C/15N-labeled FixJC was dissolved in NMR buffer [90% 1H2O/10% 2H2O containing 20 mM NaHPO4-NaH2PO4 (pH 5.5), 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na2SO4] and concentrated (1 mM). All NMR experiments were performed at a probe temperature of 25 °C on a DRX600 spectrometer. All spectra were processed on LINUXPCs with the Azara 2.6-2.7 package (W. Boucher, unpublished, http://www.bio.cam.ac.uk/azara/). For the 3D data, the two-dimensional maximum entropy method (12) was applied to obtain resolution enhancement for indirect dimensions. All of the spectra were analyzed on LINUX-PCs with the combination of customized macro programs on the OpenGL version of ANSIG 3.3 software (13). For backbone 1HN, 15N, 13CR, and 13C and side-chain 13C , resonance assignments were achieved by analyzing spinspin connectivities in four types of 3D triple-resonance experiments, CBCA(CO)NH (14), CBCANH (15), HNCO (16), and HN(CA)CO (16). The following were used for the resonance assignment of the side-chain 1H and 13C resonances: 3D experiments of HBHA(CO)NH (17), H(CCCO)NH (18, 19), (H)CC(CO)NH (19), and HCCH-TOCSY (20). The side-chain NH2 group assignment was achieved by collecting another (H)CC(CO)NH spectrum, in which the delays were optimized for observation of NH2 groups. The assignments of 1H -15N of arginine and side chains of aromatic residues were achieved by analyses of 15N- and 13Cseparated NOESY-HSQC spectra (21) with a mixing time of 150 ms, respectively. Structure Calculation. 3D 15N-separated and 13C-separated NOESY cross-peaks were selected and unambiguously assigned wherever possible. For each spectrum, the "connect" program within AZARA package was used to convert normalized peak intensities into four distance categories of <2.7, 3.3, 5, and 6 Å. Two separate lists, one of unambiguous NOE restraints, the other of ambiguous restraints, were then produced by the "connect", allowing 0.04 and 0.3 ppm tolerance for errors in the 1H and 15N/13C dimensions, respectively. Hydrogen bond derived distance constraints were obtained from an analysis of the slowly exchanging amide protons in the 3D 15N-separated NOESY spectrum. Dihedral angle restraints for backbone  and  angles were generated from the calculation of CSI (22) using 13CR, 13C , and 13C chemical shifts. These restraint files were input to CNS (23) version 1.1 based procedures and subjected to a simulated annealing protocol using the default NMR force field. Three manual iterative assignment processes were performed on the ambiguous NOEs by eliminating assign-

Twenty structures were selected on the basis of having the lowest NOE-derived energies among the 80 structures calculated. The quality of the final ensemble of the calculated structures was assessed by analyzing Ramachandran plots with PROCHECK (24) and deviations in the calculated 1HR chemical shifts from the observed values with the TOTAL program (25, 26). NMR Titration of 13C/15N-Labeled FixJC with Specific and Nonspecific DNA Duplexes. For NMR titration experiments, 13C/15N-labeled FixJC was dissolved in a titration buffer [20 mM Tris-acetate (pH 6.8), 100 mM NaCl] and concentrarted to 100 µM. Two 21 bp double-stranded DNA fragments, d(GCTAAGTAATTTCCCTTAGTG)/(CACTAAGGGAAATTACTTAGC) and d(GTGATCTAACCCAATTTCTCC)/ (GGAGAAATTGGGTTAGATCAC), corresponding to two different regions, -67 to -47 and -49 to -29 regions, respectively, of the fixK promoter sequence were synthesized. Two series of 2D 1H-15N HSQC (27, 28) spectra were collected for 13C/15N-labeled FixJC with various concentrations (0, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 µM) of the abovementioned two DNA fragments. During the titration, the total volume was kept constant at 250 µL with titration buffer. For the complete backbone assignment of FixJC on its own under buffer conditions, 3D HNCA, HN(CO)CA experiments (29) were measured at 25 °C and analyzed. RESULTS Target Sequence of the fixK Promoter for FixJ Binding. It has previously been shown that SmFixJ directs the expression of both the fixK and nifA genes (3, 4), but that other rhizobial FixJs are involved only in fixK gene expression, in which the promoter sequences are partially conserved (30). Thus, in the present study, SmfixK promoter was used as a target DNA for FixJ-P binding. A nuclease protection assay indicated that the -69 to -44 region serves as a high affinity binding site, which appears to be responsible for FixJdependent regulatory function (4). Because DNA protection assays do not permit the recognition sequence to be identified directly, we carried out a gel shift assay for wild-type and mutated DNAs to determine the FixJ recognition sequence (Figure 2). FixJ specifically binds to the wild-type sequence when it is phosphorylated (Figure 2a). The M1, M2, and M3 mutants were refractory to the binding of FixJ-P, consistent with the fact that T-65AAG-62 and C-55CCTT-51 are the most conserved among the fixK promoters of various rhizobia (30). FixJ-P failed to bind to M4, indicating that A-60ATT-57 is also required. However, it binds successfully to M5. Finally, a binding assay with a series of consecutively mutated DNAs indicated that the sequence 5-T-56AAGTAATTTCCCTTA-503 is required for FixJ-P to recognize the fixK promoter sequence (Figure 2c). We then determined the solution structure of the DNA binding domain of FixJ, and analyzed the interaction between the DNA sequence identified and the FixJC protein. Structural Determination. FixJC, a truncated protein consisting of residues 130-204 of the C-terminal region, was analyzed by NMR. The nearly complete backbone and side-chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments of FixJC were achieved by analysis of spin-spin connectivities in a

Binding of phosphorylated FixJ (a) and unphosphorylated FixJ (b) to various 25 bp double-stranded DNAs derived from the -68 to -44 region of the fixK promoter was analyzed by gel retardation assays. The wild-type sequence and 12 mutants were subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated FixJ.

The secondary structure of FixJC, predicted by a CSI analysis (22) of the assigned 13CR, 13C , and 13C resonances (Figure 3b), and an analysis of sequential and medium-range NOEs (Figure 3c) showed that this domain consists of five R-helices (Figure 3d). The solution structure of FixJC was determined from a total of 3121 unambiguous restraints (1604 intraresidue, 771 sequential, 652 medium-range, and 94 long-range distance restraints) and 698 ambiguous restraints, 54 hydrogen bond derived distance restraints, and 53 / dihedral angle restraints. Figure 3e and Figure 3f show the numbers of unambiguous and ambiguous NOE constraints per residue, respectively. The ambiguous restraints were included in the calculations from the initial stage using a sum-average potential function (31). Structural statistics of the final ensemble of 20 refined structures are summarized in Table 1. Figure 4a shows backbone traces of an ensemble of the 20 refined structures superimposed on the backbone CR, N, C atoms.

The backbone structure is well-defined except for three N-terminal vector-derived residues and two C-terminal residues. Analysis of {1H}-15N steady-state NOEs confirmed that the N-terminal and C-terminal regions are flexible (Figure 3g).

Figure 5a and Figure 5b show a comparison of the structure of FixJC with the C terminal half of the crystal structure of unphosphorylated NarL, which contains four R-helices (R7R10) and the corresponding region (R2-R5) of the solution structure of FixJC.

Figure 5c represents the structure of the C-terminal domain of Spo0A, showing that Spo0A shares the common relative orientation of the four R-helices (RA-RF for Spo0A) mentioned above. A crystallographic study on the NarLC-DNA complex has shown that the first three helices (R7-R9) are responsible for DNA binding (39). In particular, the second and third helices are referred to as "scaffolding" and "recognition"

helices, respectively, of a classical HTH motif. Several residues, which are directly involved in the DNA binding of NarLC (Figure 6b), were found to be conserved at the identical or proximal positions of FixJC (Figure 6a). Among them, four basic residues, Arg145/Arg159, Lys160/Lys174, His176/His190, and Lys186/Lys201 of FixJC/NarLC, appear to participate in electrostatic interactions with DNA backbone. In contrast, the nonconservative residues of the individual recognition helices may participate in the specific

Lys188 and Lys192 of NarLC (d), which are positioned on the recognition helix, were in contact with the major groove floor via their side chains in the NarLC-DNA complex. On the recognition helix of FixJC, two arginine residues, Arg171 and Arg177, are also present, but they are located at positions different from those of the two lysine residues of NarLC (c).

recognition of the target DNAs. Indeed, the R4 mutants, R171A and E174A, were devoid of fixK DNA binding activity (Table 2). FixJC contains an extra helix in the N-terminus (R1), Ile135 and Leu139, which provide for a hydrophobic

interaction network with Val149/Leu150 of R2 and Ala196 of R5. Since the corresponding region of unphosphorylated NarL, which is the inactive form relative to DNA binding, is disordered in the crystals, the formation of R1 in FixJC may contribute to stabilize the overall structure of the C-terminal domain so that FixJC is able to bind to the target DNA. At present, however, the possibility that the domain truncation might artificially generate a helical structure cannot be excluded.

titration experiments of FixJC using two 21 bp synthetic double-stranded DNA fragments. One contains the FixJ recognition sequence from the fixK promoter identified in the present study, and the other contains the downstream region of the promoter and was used as a negative control. The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 13C/15N-labeled FixJC showed drastic chemical shift changes and line broadening of the cross-peaks in the presence of the target DNA (Figure 7a), while the addition of the negative control caused negligible effects (Figure 7b). These spectral perturbations suggested that the binding of FixJC to its recognition sequence occurs via an intermediate to slow exchange on the NMR time scale, while the interaction with the unrelated sequence is in a much faster exchange regime. Differences in the NMR titration experiments presumably reflect the different binding affinities for the two DNAs. It is noteworthy that, in addition to the extreme line broadening of cross-peaks, more than 30 new broad crosspeaks were observed in 2D 1H-15N HSQC when more than a half-fold molar excess of the target DNA was added, suggesting that more than one molecule of FixJC binds to the target DNA. This is consistent with the fact that phosphorylated FixJ dimer binds to the fixK promoter (6, 11). DISCUSSION The FixL/FixJ system directs the expression of nitrogen fixation related genes under oxygen-limited conditions in Sinorhizobium meliloti. Upon phosphorylation, FixJ is converted into an active transcriptional factor for the fixK and nifA genes. However, their promoter regions do not share a sequence similarity (10), suggesting that two distinct binding modes are involved. To understand how FixJ binds to the fixK promoter, we first identified the recognition sequence of the high affinity binding site in the fixK promoter by a binding assay using native and mutated DNAs. We then determined the structure of the C-terminal DNA binding domain of FixJ and analyzed the interaction between the FixJC protein and the target DNA.

Regardless of whether or not response regulators are dimerized upon phosphorylation, their target DNAs usually contain direct repeats (9, 34, 40) or inverted repeats (8, 37) for the accommodation of two protein molecules. However, the high affinity target region of the fixK promoter is thought to contain neither significant palindromic nor tandem structures, and the recognition sequences remain elusive (4). The present mutational scanning experiment unambiguously indicated that 5-T-65AAGTAATTTCCCTTA-50-3 is indispensable for maximal FixJ binding (Figure 2). The 16 bp sequence is sufficiently long for the binding of dimeric FixJ, because a 5-7 bp sequence is required to accommodate one molecule of the HTH structure of DNA binding proteins (41). The short inverted repeats T-65AAG-62 and C-53TTA-50 are present, but the latter appears to make only a minor contribution (Figure 2). This is consistent with the SELEX experiment, indicating that FixJ-P preferentially binds to 5-tctaaGTAGTTTCCC-3 (lower cases are the default sequence contiguous to random nucleotides in the DNA pool) and T-52TA-50 has not been selected (42). Furthermore, although the sequence of the promoter region of Mesorhizobium loti is the most similar to that of S. meliloti, such an inverted repeat is partially disrupted (Figure 2). The present structural model confirmed that FixJC consists of five R-helices and possesses a HTH motif which is preferred for sequence-specific DNA binding by bacterial transcriptional factors (41). In particular, the overall structure is very similar to that of the C-terminal domains of NarL and Spo0A (Figure 5). As mentioned in the Results section, the structures of DNA-bound complexes of NarLC and other DNA binding proteins have shown that several residues around the recognition helix participate in nonspecific binding to the phosphate backbone, in addition to the sequence-specific binding of some residues of the recognition helix (R9 of NarLC) to the floor of the major DNA groove. Many of these are positively charged and appear to interact with the negatively charged phosphate backbones of DNA. Interestingly, these residues for nonspecific binding are well

14842 Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 45, 2005 conserved in FixJ (Figures 1 and 6a). Therefore, these structural similarities predict that the R4 residues of FixJC function in sequence-specific DNA recognition, and the surrounding residues comprise a scaffold for nonspecific binding. Thus, one can consider that the difference in the primary sequence of the recognition helix between FixJ and NarL enables them to specifically bind to each cognate DNA. Indeed, in the NarLC-DNA complex structure, two positively charged residues, Lys188 and Lys192, which are not conserved between NarLC and FixJC, are reported to come into contact with the major groove floor (Figure 6d). In the recognition helix of FixJC, instead, two arginine residues, Arg171 and Arg177, are found at different positions (Figure 6c). These two arginine residues are the most likely candidates for carrying out the sequence-specific binding of FixJC. Interactions between FixJC and the fixK promoter were observed by means of NMR titration experiments. However, we were unable to identify the individual amino acids involved in the specific binding to the DNA, because the assignments were completed poorly for the following reasons: The NMR spectra exhibited a mixture of many missing cross-peaks and extreme line broadening caused by an intermediate exchange reaction and newly born crosspeaks caused by a slow exchange reaction. These observations suggest that FixJC binds to DNA with the low binding affinity. This is consistent with a previous result indicating that the DNA binding affinity of FixJ-P is much lower than that of OmpR-P (11, 43). Extreme chemical shift changes were observed when the molar ratio of the target DNA:FixJC reached 0.5:1 (1:2). The perturbation was almost saturated even when the ratio exceeded 0.5. These results suggest that more than one molecule of FixJC binds to the high affinity recognition sequence of the fixK promoter, consistent with previous studies, which showed that the phosphorylationinduced dimerization of FixJ is required for binding to the DNA (6, 11). The nuclease protection assay showed that the fixK promoter contains the two overlapping binding sites (-69 to -44, -57 to -31) (4). The -69 to -44 region serves as a high affinity binding site, and the downstream region has a low affinity for FixJ. It is, therefore, most likely that the high affinity binding site is responsible for the FixL/ FixJ-linked transcriptional regulatory function. Our NMR titration analysis using the -49 to -29 DNA indicated a nonspecific interaction, since the low affinity region is truncated. Therefore, two molecules of FixJC, in dimeric form, appear to bind to the fixK DNA with different affinities, since the recognition sequence is necessary and sufficient in length for the accommodation of two FixJC molecules. This is in agreement with previous data showing that the 15 bp target region is protected against DNase by binding of the FixJ-P dimer (42). The response regulator family displays a diversity of phosphorylation-induced dimerization, topology of protein molecules aligned on DNA, and DNA binding affinity although they share an overall structural similarity. NarLC is dimerized in a tail-to-tail manner on the bent nirB promoter with inverted repeats, although the phosphorylation-induced dimerization of the full-length protein has not been detected in solution (8). Spo0AC binds to the abrB promoter in a head-to-tail manner, and the receiver domain is unequivocally

Kurashima-Ito et al. responsible for the phosphorylation-induced dimerization (9). Such head-to-tail binding has been proposed for OmpR and PhoB, whose targets contain direct repeats (34, 45). In the case of PhoB, phosphorylation-induced dimerization has been reported (46). Determination of the DNA-interacting residues seems to owe their high affinity for the target DNA (their Kd values are submicromolar) (34, 43). In spite of failure to identify the DNA-interacting amino acid residues of FixJ due to the low binding affinity, the present NMR titration experiments rather provided the information of two-molecule binding with different affinities. The first binding of the FixJC monomer to the fixK promoter may induce conformational changes in DNA bending and/or a structural change in FixJC, thus enhancing the affinity for a second molecule. As a result, the dimerization interface between the two molecules might be stabilized when bound to the DNA, although the truncated DNA binding domains are not dimerized solely. When considering the significance of the dimer formation of FixJ-P, one can imagine that the second FixJ molecule might play a role in interaction with RNA polymerase subunit(s) to recruit the enzyme to the fixK promoter (47). In contrast, the recognition sequence of the nifA promoter is a GTA(C/A)GTAG octamer. Then, one subunit of the FixJ-P dimer appears to bind to the target sequence, and the aberrant binding might result in the expansion (40 bp) of the protected region by the DNase protection assay (42). The reason for the variety of DNA binding affinities of response regulators is still unknown. However, the long lifetime of FixJ-P might compensate its low binding affinity to function as an active transcriptional factor, whereas the phosphorylated forms of other response regulators have shorter lifetimes of the phosphoryl bond (5). Phosphorylation-linked regulatory mechanisms still remain to be addressed. It has been suggested that the N-terminal regulator domain inhibits the transcriptional activity of the C-terminal domain in the unphosphorylated full-length FixJ (3, 4). A crystallographic analysis of unphosphorylated NarL has provided plausible evidence that the N-terminal phosphoryl receiver domain masks the DNA binding surface of the C-terminal domain and the inhibitory interdomain interaction is eliminated upon phosphorylation (32, 34). In contrast, the unphosphorylated DrrD and DrrB structures do not exhibit such steric hindrance, and the recognition helices are exposed to an aqueous phase, which does not account for the inability of DNA binding (35, 36). Interestingly, the deduced structure of FixJ, obtained by low resolution smallangle X-ray scattering analysis, resembles unphosphorylated DrrD (48). The possibility that NarL and DrrD/FixJ employ different activation mechanisms and dimerization itself is important for DrrD/FixJ to bind to their target DNAs cannot be excluded. Because of this, structural differences between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated full-length FixJ should be elucidated. SUPPORTING INFORMATION AVAILABLE
