ABSTRACT: Developing antimicrobials that are less likely to engender resistance has become an important design criterion as more and more drugs fall victim to resistance mutations. One hypothesis is that the more closely an inhibitor resembles a substrate, the more difficult it will be to develop resistant mutations that can at once disfavor the inhibitor and still recognize the substrate. To investigate this hypothesis, 10 transition-state analogues, of greater or lesser similarity to substrates, were tested for inhibition of TEM-1 -lactamase, the most widespread resistance enzyme to penicillin antibiotics. The inhibitors were also tested against four characteristic mutant enzymes: TEM-30, TEM-32, TEM-52, and TEM-64. The inhibitor most similar to the substrate, compound 10, was the most potent inhibitor of the WT enzyme, with a Ki value of 64 nM. Conversely, compound 10 was the most susceptible to the TEM-30 (R244S) mutant, for which inhibition dropped by over 100-fold. The other inhibitors were relatively impervious to the TEM30 mutant enzyme. To understand recognition and resistance to these transition-state analogues, the structures of four of these inhibitors in complex with TEM-1 were determined by X-ray crystallography. These structures suggest a structural basis for distinguishing inhibitors that mimic the acylation transition state and those that mimic the deacylation transition state; they also suggest how TEM-30 reduces the affinity of compound 10. In cell culture, this inhibitor reversed the resistance of bacteria to ampicillin, reducing minimum inhibitory concentrations of this penicillin by between 4- and 64-fold, depending on the strain of bacteria. Notwithstanding this activity, the resistance of TEM-30, which is already extant in the clinic, suggests that there can be resistance liabilities with substrate-based design.

Confronted by an enzyme prone to resistance mutations, is it better to design inhibitors that resemble the substrate or to design inhibitors dissimilar to the substrate? This is a pressing question in antiviral and antibacterial chemotherapy, where there is often considerable pressure for targets to mutate (1, 2). Colman and colleagues have argued persuasively that substrate-analogue inhibitors will be difficult to distinguish from the substrate, and since the enzyme must still recognize the substrate, this should make a successful resistance substitution difficult (3). This "substrate-analog" hypothesis thus suggests that the more similar an inhibitor is to a substrate, the more difficult it will be to find a mutant enzyme that confers resistance to that inhibitor while maintaining enough activity against the substrate to be viable. We might also consider a "novel inhibitor" hypothesis that turns the substrate-analog argument on its head: the enzyme is already good at substrate recognition, and so it will take only subtle changes to convert a substrate analogue into a substrate, or to modify specific recognition residues to

attenuate inhibition. This might be most problematic when substrate analogue inhibitors have already been widely used and mutant enzymes have had a chance to evolve against them. Such pre-evolved resistance would not pose a threat to novel inhibitors. For resistance to -lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, unintentional experiments that speak to this question have been taking place in the clinic since the 1940s. Soon after penicillin was introduced, bacteria resistant to it were observed (4) and were eventually shown to produce a class A -lactamase enzyme that hydrolyzed the eponymous -lactam ring, inactivating the drugs. -Lactamases, such as the plasmid-borne TEM-1, spread with the use of penicillins, cephalosporins, and related -lactams (5). To combat these enzymes, mechanism-based inhibitors, such as clavulanate (Figure 1), were introduced (6), followed by " lactamase-stable" compounds such as third-generation cephalosporins (7). Both classes are themselves -lactams and resemble the original substrates. In response to these inhibitors and " -lactamase resistant" compounds, mutant TEM -lactamases began to appear in the clinic; over 100 of these have been characterized since 1983 (www.lahey.org/studies/temtable.htm). Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT) mutants such as TEM-30, TEM-32, and TEM-34 confer resistance to clinically used -lactamase

inhibitors such as clavulanate. Extended spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) mutants such as TEM-10, TEM-52, and TEM64 confer resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. Both classes of mutant enzymes have arisen through only a few substitutions and either avoid or simply hydrolyze the inhibitors and " -lactamase-stable" drugs. Considerable literature now exists on the clinical manifestations, mechanisms of action, evolutionary relationships, and structures of these mutant enzymes (see reviews by Knowles (8), Yang (9), Matagne (10), and Knox (11)). In addition, most inhibitors and " -lactamase-stable" drugs are either relatively inactive against or susceptible to Class C -lactamases, such as AmpC, which, like the TEM mutants, are increasingly prevalent in the clinic (12). Although inhibitors and " -lactamase-stable" compounds are substrate-analogues, they are imperfect compounds to test stability to resistance mutants. -Lactamases have only had to lose off-pathwaysand, hence for substrates, unimportantsreactions to become resistant to mechanismbased inhibitors such as clavulanate. Similarly, " -lactamasestable" compounds such as cefotaxime are thought to be too large to bind in the -lactamase site in a catalytically

competent configurationsresistance has arisen through substitutions that simply enlarge the active site, allowing the enzymes to hydrolyze these compounds as they would any other -lactam. Inhibitors that are hydrolytically inert would overcome this problem, since the enzymes would not be able to mutate to convert them into substrates and would provide a better test for the substrate-analog hypothesis. For serine -lactamases, such as TEM, an example of such nonhydrolyzable inhibitors are boronic acid transition-state analogues (13-18). These molecules adopt a stable tetrahedral adduct when bound to the catalytic serine (Figure 1E,F), reversibly inhibiting -lactamases. Both boronic acids and the related phosphonic acids (19, 20) can inhibit serine -lactamases tightly, reaching Ki values in the 1 to 10 nM range (14, 17, 18). We have found that transition-state analogues that display more substrate groups have higher affinity for the class C -lactamase AmpC. For instance, compound 10a (Figure 1E) is a boronic acid that bears about half of the recognition elements found in most -lactams, the R1 side chain of the cephalosporin cephalothin (Figure 1A), and is a 300 nM inhibitor of AmpC (16). Compound 10 (Figure 1F) is a

Wang et al. M182T/G238S); and TEM-64 (E104K/R164S/M182T). All were cloned, expressed, and purified as previously described (22, 23). Enzyme Kinetics. The enzyme assay was carried out in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 at room temperature. Concentrations were determined using the extinction coefficients of the mutant enzymes, diluted from stock solutions, and the substrates, as described (23). The values of kcat and KM were determined by initial velocity nonlinear regression analysis (Vo ) kcat,S/(KM+S)) using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The different mutants had different substrate specificities and activities and different enzyme concentrations and substrates were used for each. For TEM1, 10 nM enzyme was used with 500 µM cephalothin (Sigma) (Km ) 180 µM) as the initial substrate concentration. For TEM-64, 11 nM enzyme and 300 µM cephalothin (Km ) 110 µM). For TEM-52, 4 nM of enzyme was used with 300 µM cefotaxime (Sigma) (Km ) 80 µM) as the initial substrate concentration. For TEM-30, 0.5 nM of enzyme was used with 300 µM nitrocefin (Oxoid) (Km ) 420 µM) as the initial substrate concentration. For TEM-32, 3 nM of enzyme was used with 300 µM nitrocefin (Km ) 95 µM) as the initial substrate concentration. The hydrolysis of cephalothin and cefotaxime were monitored at 260 nm, and that of nitrocefin was monitored at 480 nm. All assays were initiated by the addition of enzyme, except for the m-carboxyphenylglycylboronic acids 8, 9, and 10. For these three, a pronounced incubation effect was observed, and so the enzymes were allowed to preincubate with the inhibitors for five minutes before the reactions were initiated by addition of substrate. For these m-carboxyphenylglycylboronic acids, inhibition rates were measured after the reactions had reached a steady state rate (i.e., after the initial lag typical of slow off-rate reactions had been overcome), typically by using the final 20 s of a 300 s reaction. Ki values were determined using progress curves, which have been shown to be accurate for boronic acid inhibitors of -lactamases (13, 15, 16, 18). Typically, progress curves at 50% inhibition were compared to uninhibited curves using the method of Waley (13); for compounds 8, 9, and 10, progress curves for reactions inhibited at the 80% level were used. Crystallization and Data Collection. Crystals were grown using micro-seeding techniques. Most of the complexes were grown with mutant M182T as a proxy for TEM-1 WT. This enzyme is isofunctional with TEM-1, but is more stable and diffracts to a higher resolution (24, 25), and for this reason was used in the crystallographic experiments. We will refer to this enzyme as WT*. An 8 µL droplet containing about 3-5 mg/mL of the enzyme and 2.5-3.0 mM boronic acid inhibitors in 0.65-0.70 M sodium-potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.3, was seeded with micro crystals of apo-WT* (23) or TEM-64 (25) and placed over 1.4 M sodiumpotassium phosphate well buffer, pH 8.3. Single crystals appeared in about two weeks and grew to a maximum size in two weeks. Crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant (25% sucrose in 1.6 M phosphate buffer, pH 8.3) for less than 60 s and then flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected from single crystals on the 5ID beamline of the DND-CAT at Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL). Single-wavelength data were measured at different energies using a MARCCD detector (Table 2). Reflections were integrated, scaled, and merged using the HKL package

boronic acid that displays both the cephalothin side chain and a group from the other half of a -lactam substrate, the C3(4) carboxylate, and is a 1 nM inhibitor of AmpC (18). Having designed 10 against AmpC, we wondered whether it would also be active against class A -lactamases. The compound would need to inhibit both classes of enzymes to have wide clinical impact, and compound 10a, its predecessor, was only a 7 µM inhibitor of TEM-1 (16). If compound 10 did inhibit the class A -lactamases potently, we were interested to learn the structural bases of recognition. Transition state analogues can adopt two different orientations in the binding sites of class A -lactamases, mimicking either the acylation transition state (Figure 2B) (21, 22) or the deacylation transition state (Figure 2D) (14); we wanted to understand what inhibitor groups determined the transition state that was mimicked. Most importantly, we wondered how active compound 10 would be against the mutant IRT and ESBL TEM enzymes. Here we investigate these questions by determining the affinity of compound 10 and nine analogues against TEM-1 and four characteristic mutant enzymes: two IRTs, TEM30 and TEM-32, and two ESBLs, TEM-52 and TEM-64. To understand the bases of affinity, we determine X-ray crystal structures of four of these compounds, including compound 10, in complex with TEM-1. We find that whereas compound 10 shows high affinity for TEM-1 and can reverse TEM-mediated resistance in bacterial cell culture, its affinity is dramatically attenuated by at least one of the known mutant enzymes. The implications for inhibitor design and the evolution of resistance will be considered. MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of TEM-1 Mutants. The enzymes used in this study included: TEM-1 wild type (WT); the stability mutant M182T, which we will refer to as WT* (see below) (22); TEM-30 (R244S); TEM-32 (M69I/M182T); TEM-52 (E104K/

CNS (28) using rigid-body refinement followed by torsion angle simulated annealing. Several rounds of Cartesian and B-factor refinement was followed by manual corrections using 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc A-weighted maps displayed with TURBO (29) until the refinement statistics converged to their final values (Table 2). The structure of the complex between WT* and compound 5, which was determined to 1.2 Å resolution, was refined further in SHELX97 (30). The refinement was carried out using ADPs (anisotropic displacement parameters) with standard DELU (rigid-bond), SIMU (spatially adjacent atoms), and ISOR (isolated atoms to be approximately isotropic) restraints and converged at Rcryst/Rfree of 12.6/ 15.6%. The introduction of hydrogen atoms in the model lowered the R-factors slightly. At this stage DELU, SIMU, and ISOR restraints were adjusted using the program PARVATI (31). The final R-factors were 10.6% for Rcryst and 14.8% for Rfree (Table 2). Synthesis. Compounds 1-7 (16) and compounds 8, 9, and 10 were synthesized as previously described (18). All other compounds were used as supplied by the manufacturers without further purification. Microbiology. Compound 10 was tested for synergy with the -lactam ampicillin against pathogenic Staphylococci from clinical isolates at the Hospital Ramon y Cajal; these ´ bacteria were resistant to -lactams due to expression of class A -lactamases. Strains of bacteria tested were: ATTC Staphylococcal aureus (Sa) (non- -lactamase producer), S. aureus isolate 22491 (Sa22491) (class A -lactamase producer), S. aureus isolate 23614 (Sa23614) (class A -lactamase producer), and S. aureus isolate 24273 (Sa24273) (class A -lactamase producer). Also tested were three laboratory strains of K12 Escherichia coli transformed with TEM-1 (E. coli TEM-1), TEM-15 (E. coli TEM-15), and TEM-52 (E. coli TEM-52), all expressed off the pALTER plasmid (25). Minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) values were determined with Mueller-Hinton Broth II using the micro-dilution method according to NCCLS guidelines (32). Each value reported reflects the average of three independent experiments. RESULTS Enzyme Inhibition. All of the boronic acid inhibitors (Table 1) bind reversibly to TEM-1 and its mutants. For the

m-carboxyphenylglycylboronic acids (8, 9, and 10) inhibition was time-dependent. For these three, activity displayed classic time-dependent recovery from inhibition in a reaction initiated with substrate (i.e., reaction rates increased after an initial lag-phase before reaching a steady-state plateau). The time-dependence in the inhibition thus reflects a slow off-rate. Consistent with reversibility, the inhibitors could be competed off by increasing substrate concentration. We have accounted for this incubation effect in the Ki values reported for these inhibitors (Methods). As with the class C -lactamase AmpC (18), adding an m-carboxyphenyl group to the glycylboronic acids improved TEM-1 inhibition considerably, by between 25- and 100fold (compare compound 8 to 8a or compound 10 to 10a, Table 1). For the WT enzyme, the addition of the mcarboxyphenyl side chain improves binding energy by between 1.9 and 2.8 kcal/mol, with compound 10 reaching a Ki value of 64 nM. For the ESBL mutants TEM-52 and TEM-64, and for the IRT mutant TEM-32, the trends in affinities were similar to that of TEM-1, though they were typically two to 3-fold worse than for the WT enzyme. There were some exceptions to this rule. For instance, compound 5 was actually 4-fold better versus TEM-52 than it was versus WT, and was 13fold better versus TEM-52 than it was versus TEM-64. On the other had, compound 7 was 2-fold better versus TEM64 than it was versus TEM-52 (Table 1). It is interesting to note that compound 5 bears the R1 side chain of cefotaxime and that TEM-52, though classified as having an extended spectrum against 3rd generation cephalosporins in general, is primarily a cefotaximase, with activities 25-fold better for cefotaxime than ceftazidime (25, 33). Correspondingly, compound 7 bears the R1 side chain of ceftazidime, and TEM-64 is an ESBL that has 2-fold greater activity against ceftazidime than it does against cefotaxime (25, 34). The trends in affinities for the transition-state analogues thus appear to mimic the trends in substrate recognition among the mutant enzymes. The important outlier was the IRT TEM-30, against which the m-carboxyphenylglycylboronic acids (8, 9, and 10) lost 2 orders of magnitude (2.8 kcal/mol) in affinity (Table 1). Thus, compound 10, which had been the most potent inhibitor of the TEM-1, saw its Ki increase from 0.064 µM to 7.8 µM against TEM-30. In this mutant enzyme Arg244

TEM -Lactamase has been substituted with a serine. This removes a hydrogen bond with the C3(4) carboxylate of substrate -lactams, which the m-carboxy group in 8-10 was designed to mimic (the hydrogen-bond between Arg244 and the m-carboxy group can be observed the WT*/10 complex, below). On the other hand, the glycylboronic acids (1-7, 8a, and 10a), which lack the m-carboxyphenyl side chain and are less substrate-like than 10, have undiminished affinity for TEM30 relative to WT TEM-1. X-Ray Crystal Structures. To investigate the structural bases for recognition, we determined the crystal structure of TEM-1 in complex with four of the inhibitors, including the high affinity 10 (Table 2). Excluding proline and glycine residues, all amino acids were in the most favored and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, except for residue Leu220, which consistently in TEM structures, including one determined at 0.85 Å (24), is in a generously allowed region (35). In all structures, the position of the inhibitor in the active site was unambiguously identified in the initial Fo-Fc difference map contoured at 3 (Figure 3). Electron density connected the O of the catalytic Ser70 to the boron atom of the inhibitors. The boron geometry was tetrahedral, as expected. Compounds 2, 5, and 6, which display only the R1 side chain of -lactams (Figure 1), adopted a conformation in the active site consistent with acylation transitionstate analogues, resembling the structure of a phosphonate transition-state analogue in complex with the class A -lactamase PC1 from S. aureus (21) and the ultra-highresolution structure of compound 7 in complex with WT* (24). All three boronic acid complexes overlap well with each other (Figure 4a) (24). In these glycylboronic acid structures, the O1 boronic acid hydroxyl hydrogen bonds with the "oxyanion" (36) or "electrophilic" (37) hole formed by the backbone amide groups of Ser70 and Ala237 (Figure 4b; Table 3). The O2 of the boronic acid hydrogen-bonds with Ser130 and typically an ordered water. The R1 amide group of the inhibitor is placed in the amide recognition region defined by Asn132 and Ala237 (38). The R1 amide nitrogen interacts with the backbone oxygen of Ala237 and the R1 amide oxygen interacts with N2 of Asn132. The distal ring that terminates these R1 side chains typically lies in the region of Glu240, though only the exo-cyclic amino group of compound 5 appears to directly hydrogen bond with this residue. The exception is the side chain of compound 2, whose steric bulk forces it to lie in a different region of the site, forming nonpolar interactions with the side chain of Tyr105 (Figure 4a). In contrast to compounds 2, 5, and 6, compound 10, which adds the m-carboxyphenyl group to the glycylboronic acids, adopts a different orientation in the TEM-1 active site (Figure 4c). The WT*/10 complex resembles that of a related transition-state analogue in complex with TEM-1 (17). This latter structure is thought to mimic the deacylation transition state (14) rather than the acylation transition state mimicked by 2, 5, and 6. Whereas O1 is still in the "oxyanion" (36) or "electrophilic" (37) hole, the configuration around the boron has inverted, with the boronic O2 oxygen adopting the opposite pyramidal position as that adopted in by the simpler glycylboronic acids. In its new position, the O2 hydroxyl hydrogen-bonds with the catalytic base Glu166, displacing the ordered, catalytic water (Wat4) (14). The phenyl ring of

compound 10 stacks with the aromatic ring of Tyr105 in a herringbone geometry, appearing to make quadrupole interactions. The carboxylate of the inhibitor hydrogen-bonds with Arg244 and Ser235 and an ordered water, Wat56, that appears to be highly conserved among TEM structures (14, 22, 39) (Table 3). These interactions between Arg244, Ser235, and water are also seen to the C3 carboxylate of -lactams (40), consistent with this inhibitor carboxylate mimicking this ubiquitous substrate group. We wondered if the structure of 10 in complex with WT* would suggest a reason for the slow off-rates these compounds experience in the inhibition assays (above). A common explanation for kinetic barriers to disassociation is reorganization of the enzyme. No significant conformational change in the enzyme was observed either relative to the apo-structure (41) or relative to the complexes with the glycylboronic acids 2, 5, 6 (this paper), or 7 (22), which do not experience an obvious kinetic barrier. Whereas a role for enzyme reorganization cannot be ruled out dynamically, the ground-state structures show little sign of such an effect. On the other hand, reorganization of bound waters and the ligand are apparent. In the crystallographic complex of 10/ WT*, the ordered catalytic water (Wat4) is displaced by the ligand, whereas this water is present in the structures of the glycylboronic acids complexes. Also, the structure of 10 has undergone an inversion of configuration at the boronic acid center relative to the glycylboronic acids; if this inversion occurs on the enzyme, it may also contribute to a kinetic barrier in the binding equilibria. Microbiology. To investigate the potential of these compounds to reverse antibiotic resistance, we undertook antimicrobial studies in bacterial cell culture. The minimum

its MIC values improved by between four and 8-fold (Table 4). When tested against a laboratory strain of E. coli producing either TEM-1, TEM-15, or TEM-52, ampicillin MIC values improved 64-fold when used in combination with compound 10. Whereas these inhibitors have not been tested for enzymatic inhibition of the S. aureaus enzyme, we note that these enzymes are related and that other boronic acid inhibitors of TEM also inhibit the S. aureus enzyme, indeed often with greater affinity (42).

DISCUSSION As this series of transition-state analogues becomes more substrate like, affinity rises for WT TEM-1 -lactamase. Adding an m-carboxyphenyl group, meant to mimic the C3(4) carboxylate of -lactams, to the glycylboronic acids improves affinity for the TEM enzymes by up to 100-fold, to 64 nM. This improvement appears to owe to hydrogen bonds between the m-carboxylate group in compound 10 and residues in the -lactamase site that typically bind to the

Wang et al. Herzberg, Pratt, and colleagues (21). Following these authors, we consider these structures to be analogues of the acylation transition state (Figure 2B). Adding the m-carboxyphenyl to these glycylboronic acids causes the boronic acid group of compound 10 to invert, changing the stereochemistry of the boronic acid in the site. The O2 boronic oxygen of 10 is now found on the opposite side of the boron, where it displaces the catalytic Wat4 and hydrogen-bonds directly to the catalytic base, Glu166. These interactions closely resemble those of analogous boronic acids bound to TEM-1 determined by Strynadka and colleagues (14, 17). Following these authors, we therefore consider these to be analogues of the deacylation transition state (Figure 2D). These analogues resemble each other closely enough to allow one to identify what distinguishes acylation from deacylation transition-state mimics. It seems that interactions with the carboxylic acid of compound 10, and by extension the C3(4) carboxylate of substrates, is a key recognition determinant for deacylation transition states in class A -lactamases. Superimposing these transition-state analogue complexes with that of a substrate (40) gives a structural view of the reaction coordinate, from acylation transitionstate to the previously determined acyl-intermediate (40) to the deacylation transition-state (Figure 2B-D). The expected umbrella inversions of configuration between the tetrahedral acylation transition state and the planar acyl-intermediate, and between the planar intermediate and the deacylation transition state, are evident (Figure 5). This inversion results in the movement of the boronic O2 oxygen from the acylation transition-state analogues (Figure 4B), where this atom represents the position of the lactam nitrogen leaving group, to its position in the deacylation transitions state analogues, where the O2 represents the position of the deacylating water as it attacks the acyl center (Figure 4C). We return, finally, to our original question: confronted by an enzyme prone to resistance mutations, is it better to design inhibitors that resemble the substrate or to design inhibitors dissimilar to the substrate? The most substratelike of the inhibitors considered here is compound 10, which approaches an atom-by-atom transition-state analogue for cephalothin (Figure 1D,F). An attractive feature of this compound is its high affinity for WT TEM-1, as is its efficacy in cell culture (Table 4). It has an unusually broad spectrum of activity, inhibiting both class A and class C -lactamases (18) and several mutant TEM enzymes. In these aspects the compound is a good lead compound for drug design to reverse antibiotic resistance to the -lactams. If compound 10 has a tragic flaw, it is that it has gained its affinity by resembling the substrate, and this has made it vulnerable to mutant enzymes such as TEM-30 (Table 1). TEM-30 has been selected by the use of clavulanate and related inhibitors, and is widespread in clinical infections. Therapeutic use of 10 should thus rapidly select for TEM30. This result contrasts with those of Varghese, Colman and colleagues with inhibitors of influenza neuraminadase, where the most substrate-like inhibitors were the least susceptible to two different mutant enzymes selected by related transition-state analogues (3). How might these results be reconciled? One possible explanation is that -lactams and -lactamase inhibitors have a much longer history in the clinic than do neuraminidase inhibitors, and so simply more mutants have

ubiquitous C3(4) carboxylate of -lactam substrates, including Arg244 and Ser235 (Figure 4c). Compound 10 is thus one of the few inhibitors to bind well to both class A and class C -lactamases (18), and can greatly increase the sensitivity of resistant bacteria to -lactams in cell culture (Table 4). The activity of this compound against three of four mutant TEMs, at similar concentrations, is encouraging. The other side of this coin is that as this series becomes more substrate-like, it appears to fall victim to at least one -lactamase resistance mutant. TEM-30 (R244S) was selected by the use of clavulanate in the clinic and appears to work by disrupting the hydrogen bond between Arg244 and the C3 carboxylate of this -lactam (39, 43, 44). Disrupting this interaction may misorient clavulanate in the binding site, reducing off-pathway reactions necessary for formation of an irreversible adduct (22). Since the m-carboxyphenyl group, which is responsible for the improved affinity of compound 10, mimics this C3 carboxylate, it is in retrospect unsurprising that TEM-30 is less inhibited by this compound than is TEM-1. Of mechanistic interest is the differential binding of the transition-state analogues. The TEM-catalyzed hydrolysis of -lactams begins with the formation of a pre-covalent encounter complex (Figure 2A), which is rapidly attacked by the nucleophilic Ser70. The reaction proceeds through an acylation transition state (Figure 2B) that collapses to a relatively stable acyl adduct (Figure 2C). The catalytic water (Water 4 in this study), activated by Glu166, attacks this acyl intermediate to form a deacylation transition state (Figure 2D) that collapses to form an enzyme-product complex (Figure 2E), followed byproduct disassociation to regenerate the free enzyme. Transition-state analogues that lack the m-carboxyphenyl side chain (compounds 1-7, 8a, and 10a) bind very differently than transition-state analogues that possess this side chain (compounds 8, 9, and 10), presumably reflecting either the acylation or deacylation transition-state structures. The structures of four glycylboronic acids that lack this m-carboxyphenyl group have been determined with TEM -lactamases (see also (22, 24)). All bind similarly. A key mechanistic feature of these complexes is that the O2 boronic oxygen is oriented away from the deacylating water (Wat4) and toward Ser130, which is thought to activate the lactam nitrogen for leaving in the acylation step of the reaction. These features resemble the structure of a previously determined phosphonate analogue bound to a related class A -lactamase determined by

been explored. Indeed, clavulanate is a natural product of evolutionary warfare from Streptomyces claVulageris and -lactamase-producing bacteria have been exposed to this inhibitor over geologic time. On the other hand, TEM-1 is converted into TEM-30 by only a single substitution (Arg244fSer), and many related mutants have been isolated in the clinic (e.g, the IRTs TEM-31 (R244C), TEM-41 (R244T), TEM-44 (R244S), TEM-51 (R244H), TEM-54 (R244L), and TEM-79 (R244G)), suggesting that substitutions at this position are easy to select. Another explanation is that it might be eVen easier to find mutants for novel inhibitors than it is for substrate analogues. As Vargese, Colman, and colleagues point out (3), the mutants to the neuraminidase transition-state analogues sacrifice some of their intrinsic enzyme activity to gain resistance, and the same is certainly true of TEM-30 and other TEM mutants (25). Genuinely novel inhibitors, dissimilar to the substrate, might not force this tradeoff (3). To investigate this hypothesis, it will be necessary to test more diverse inhibitors against a broader spectrum of the extant mutants. What can be said at this point is that whereas affinity and enzyme spectrum improve with substrate-similarity in this series of inhibitors, substrate similarity is no sure protection from resistance mutants. The "substrate-analog" hypothesis for inhibitor design may yet prove to be the best strategy when confronting shifting targets. Our results suggest that more research is warranted to address this key problem in an age of widespread antimicrobial resistance.
