INTRODUCTION Vertebrates obtain vitamin A from the diet either as carotenoids or as long chain fatty acid esters of retinol which, prior to absorption, are in both cases converted to free retinol, the form of the vitamin taken up by the intestinal mucosa.1 After cellular uptake, the free retinol is bound by cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs), a protein family that in mammals includes four characterized members with significant sequence similarity but a very different tissue distribution.2 In particular, the form that is most abundant in the absorbing mucosa of the small intestine is cellular retinol binding protein II (CRBP II), which accounts for $1% of the total soluble protein present in this tissue. The 133 amino acid CRBP II is believed to play several very important roles in the metabolism of the vitamin3­5: it can bind to the membrane transporters to facilitate retinol entrance into the cell, it protects the cell from the detergent effects of free retinol and probably interacts with the enzymes that reesterify retinol prior to its release into the chylomicrons and thus modulates retinol metabolism.6 The protein was first purified from rat tissue,7 the species in which this molecule has been most extensively studied. The Xray structure of both the apo and holo forms of rat ° CRBP II to 2 A resolution revealed that there were essentially no conformational changes between the apo and holo forms.8 Subsequent NMR experiments have addressed this issue in very great detail.9­11 More recently, a CRBP highly homologous to rat CRBP II was identified and structurally characterized in the zebrafish. In this case, the resolution of the crystal structures was ° ° higher, 1.4 A for the holo and 1.7 A for the apo form,

and more significant variations were observed between the two forms.12 Human CRBP II was first isolated and partially characterized many years after the discovery of rat CRBP II13 and it was later shown that retinol uptake and metabolism are correlated to its level in the human intestinal cells.14 We report here the X-ray structures of human ° apo and holo CRBP II solved at 1.2 A resolution and compare the two structures between them and with the structures of zebrafish and rat CRBP II.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein expression, purification, complex formation, and crystallization

The cDNA coding for human CRBP II (IMAGE ID 3033364), obtained from RZPD (Deutsches Ressourcenzentrum fuer Genomforschung), was amplified by PCR using primers designed to introduce restriction sites for BamH I and Hind III endonucleases and a sequence coding for a digestion site for thrombin in the 30 end of the amplified fragment. After purification, the fragment and the expression vector pQE50 (Qiagen) were digested with

the above-mentioned restriction enzymes and incubated with ligase to insert the cDNA in the vector respecting the reading frame. SG13009 E. coli cells were transformed with the resulting vector, grown at 378C, and protein synthesis was induced with isopropyl b-D-1 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at 208C. Under these conditions of subcloning in pQE50, the expressed intracellular domain is fused to a histidine tag through its C terminus. The presence of the tag allowed the affinity purification of the fused protein by passing the bacterial extracts through a nickel-sepharose column. The column was equilibrated with 20 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.5, 0.5M NaCl 10 mM imidazole and 0.02% NaN3 and the bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 10 to 500 mM. After the affinity column, the tag was removed by thrombin digestion and the protein was further purified by gel filtration in a Superdex G-75 column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.5, 0.15M NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3. Complete removal of the tag was assessed by Western blot analysis using an anti-His-HRPconjugated antibody (Sigma­Aldrich). The purified protein showed a single band in SDS-PAGE. Crystallization conditions for the apoprotein were explored using Hampton Research Screens at 208C with the hanging-drop method, mixing 1 lL of the protein solution with the same volume of the precipitating solution, and equilibrating versus a volume of 0.3 mL of the latter in the reservoir. The conditions yielding very small crystals were later refined until crystals that were large enough for data collection were obtained. The best crystals of the apoprotein grow by mixing equal volumes of the protein solution and 0.1M sodium citrate pH 5.6, 0.2M Na/K tartrate, and 1.4M ammonium sulfate. To prepare the complex with retinol, 10 times the molar protein concentration of all-trans retinol dissolved in 100 lL ethanol was added to the apoprotein at a concentration of about 0.5 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris­HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The solution was stirred overnight in the dark at 208C and formation of the complex was assessed by examining the UV spectrum of the protein. The crystals of the holoprotein grow under the same conditions and are isomorphous to those of the apoprotein.

The structure of the apoprotein was solved using the CCP4 suite of programs for crystallographic computing. The initial phases were calculated by the molecular replacement method as implemented in the program MOLREP,17 with the coordinates of rat CRBP II (Protein data bank, accession code 1OPA) as the search probe. The rotation function presented a very high distinct peak with an Rf 5 41.1, whereas the second peak had an Rf 5 27.5. The solution of the translation function corre° sponding to the first peak, calculated with data to 3.0 A resolution was also very clear and had a correlation coefficient of 39.8 and an R factor of 48.3. The protein molecule was initially rigid body refined, the electron density examined and the proper side chains introduced. Model building was done using the program XtalView.18 Conventional refinement using the program REFMAC19 followed. During the process of refinement and model

building, the quality of the model was controlled with the program PROCHECK.20 Solvent molecules were added in the final stages of refinement according to hydrogen-bond criteria and only if their B factors refined to reasonable values and if they improved the R free. The crystals of the holoprotein are isomorphous to those of the apoprotein. The model was refined using the program REFMAC and the retinol molecule introduced before the solvent. The final refinement statistics for the models of the two crystal forms are summarized in Table I.

A very similar situation was observed in the high-resolution structure of zebrafish CRBP,12 but in this case the values of the two torsion angles are 254.88 and 2168.78. The other main contacts of the vitamin and the protein are established with hydrophobic side chains as shown in Figure 1(b). The main difference between the apo and holo forms of rat CRBP II was found around Arg 35.8 Although this amino acid is conserved in the human protein, no detectable differences were found between the two forms in this area of human CRBP II. More important differences were found between the two forms of zebrafish CRBP II.12 In this case, there are differences in the main chain of residues 55­58 and 74­77 and in the side chains of Phe 57, Arg 58, Tyr 60, and Leu 77. The apo and holo forms of human CRBP II differ only in the position of two amino acids: Ser 76 and Tyr 60. The latter has a single conformation in the holoprotein and two conformations in the apo form, the one with the highest occupancy in a position that, in the holo form, is occupied by the retinol molecule. Similarly, two different conformations are found for Ser 76 in the apo form of the protein. Figure 1(c) is a stereo diagram showing the two models superimposed and the side chains of Phe 57, Arg 58, Tyr 60, and Ser 76. Figure 1(d) shows the sequence alignment of human, rat, and zebrafish CRBP II with the amino acids that are found in different conformations in the apo and holo forms indicated with dots in different colors. Ten water molecules are found in the internal cavity of both the apo and holo forms of human CRBP II in the same positions and four additional molecules are found in the cavity of the apo form. They have been labeled sequentially from 1 to 10 in the two PDB files. Comparison of their location with that of the water molecules in zebrafish CRBP reveals that 7 out of the 10 molecules are in the same position; in our notation, molecule numbers 1, 8, and 10 are not present in the zebrafish protein. Five water molecules identified in rat CRBP II are in the same position as molecules 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 of human CRBP II, but in this case the resolution was significantly lower so that perhaps some of the missing molecules may not have been identified for this reason. The results of this study confirm that in mammals the very stable conformations in the crystals of holo and apo CRBP II are virtually identical and identify in the side chain of a single amino acid, Tyr 60, the most important conformational difference between the two forms of the protein. The evolutionary significance of the greater differences found in the zebrafish equivalent of this protein probably deserves further investigation.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The final model of the apo and holoprotein correspond to the full-length 133 amino acid chain plus four amino acids in the N terminus deriving from the cloning procedure, and four amino acids in the C terminus, part of the thrombin cleavage site. The models contain 1158 protein atoms, one tartrate and two sulfate molecules and, the holo form, an all-trans retinol molecule. The water molecules included in the models are 156 for the apo and 165 for the holo form of the protein. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The stereochemical quality of the two protein models was assessed with the program PROCHECK20; the apoprotein has 93.8% of the residues in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot and the remaining 6.2% in the additionally allowed region whereas the holo form has 92.2% of the residues in the most favorable region, 7.0 in the additionally allowed region and 0.8% in the generously allowed region. The last percentage corresponds to a single amino acid, Leu 77, which, in both zebrafish CRBP and rat CRBP II are found in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The overall fold consists of the canonical b barrel with 10 strands of anti-parallel b chain and the two a helices inserted in between the first and the second strands. Figure 1(a) is a cartoon representation of the complex with retinol showing that the vitamin is bound with the alcohol group buried most deeply into the internal cavity of the protein. Figure 1(b) shows, on the left, the electron density for retinol, contoured at a 1.5-r level in the 2Fobs-Fc maps of the co-crystals and, on the right side, a diagram representing the side chains of the protein in contact with the ligand. The hydroxyl group of the ligand is found in two distinct conformations, the canonical of the all-trans retinol, ° at a distance of 3.36 A from the OG of Thr51 and a slightly distorted conformation which is hydrogen ° bonded to the NZ of Lys 40, at a distance of 2.77 A. In the two conformations, the positions of C13 and C14 overlap whereas the positions of C15 and O1 differ. The torsion angle of the two conformations is 79.98 in the canonical conformation and 157.48 in the alternative one.
