Natural killer T (NKT) cells provide an innate-type immune response upon T cell receptor interaction with CD1d-presented antigens. We demonstrate through equilibrium tetramer binding and antigen presentation assays with V 14i-positive NKT cell hybridomas that the Sphingomonas glycolipid -galacturonosyl ceramide (GalAGSL) is a NKT cell agonist that is significantly weaker than -galactosylceramide ( -GalCer), the most potent known NKT agonist. For GalA-GSL, a shorter fatty acyl chain, an absence of the 4-OH on the sphingosine tail and a 6 -COOH group on the galactose moiety account for its observed antigenic potency. We further determined the crystal structure of mCD1d in complex with GalA-GSL at 1.8-Å resolution. The overall binding mode of GalA-GSL to mCD1d is similar to that of the short-chain -GalCer ligand PBS-25, but its sphinganine chain is more deeply inserted into the F pocket due to alternate hydrogen-bonding interactions between the sphinganine 3-OH with Asp-80. Subsequently, a slight lateral shift (>1 Å) of the galacturonosyl head group is noted at the CD1 surface compared with the galactose of -GalCer. Because the relatively short C14 fatty acid of GalA-GSL does not fully occupy the A pocket, a spacer lipid is found that stabilizes this pocket. The lipid spacer was identified by GC MS as a mixture of saturated and monounsaturated palmitic acid (C16). Comparison of available crystal structures of -anomeric glycosphingolipids now sheds light on the structural basis of their differential antigenic potency and has led to the design and synthesis of NKT cell agonists with enhanced cell-based stimulatory activities compared with -GalCer.
adjuvant glycolipid

he CD1 family of antigen-presenting glycoproteins mediates T cell responses through the presentation of self and foreign lipids, glycolipids, lipopeptides, or amphipathic small molecules to T cell receptors (TCR) (1­10). In humans, the various CD1 isoforms are categorized into group I (CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, and CD1e) and group II (CD1d) based on sequence similarity (11). Through the binding and presentation of endogenous and exogenous lipid antigens to TCRs, the CD1 pathway is reminiscent of peptide presentation by MHC class I and class II molecules. The group II isotype, CD1d, presents antigens to a unique population of T lymphocytes termed natural killer T (NKT) cells (4), which express an invariant V 14i TCR in mice or V 24i TCR in humans, in addition to NK 1.1 and other receptors typical of NK cells (12). These cells are sometimes called V 14i or V 24i NKT cells to distinguish them from other T lymphocytes that can express NK1.1. The first defined and most potent V 14i NKT cell agonist, -galactosylceramide ( -GalCer), was originally isolated from a marine sponge and subsequently optimized by medicinal chemistry (13). When bound to CD1d, -GalCer strongly activates V 14i NKT cells, causing a rapid release of T helper type 1 and 2 cytokines. Although -GalCer has been of great value and use in exploration of NKT cell

biology, its unusual origin left unresolved questions about the role of NKT cells in host defense against microbial infections. The recent discovery of -glycuronosylceramides (14­17), including -galacturonosyl and -glucuronosylceramide, in Sphingomonas bacteria as CD1d-presented V 14i NKT cell antigens, established the role of V 14i NKT cells in antimicrobial defense. Sphingomonas are Gram-negative bacteria that lack LPS, and recognition of these -glycuronosylceramides could serve as alternatives to the LPS response in an innate-type reaction that activates dendritic cells and other cell types. Additionally, mycobacterial phosphatidylinositol mannosides (3) and the self-glycolipid ganglioside GD3 can activate a small subpopulation of NKT cells, and the self-lipid isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGB3) (8) is apparently required for V 14i NKT development in mice. The potency of all of these antigens, however, is significantly lower than that of -GalCer. The structural explanation for the high potency of -GalCer is still not resolved nor are the means by which diverse antigens are recognized by TCRs with an invariant -chain and a restricted V usage. Crystal structures of human (h)CD1a (18, 19), hCD1b (20, 21), hCD1d (22), and mouse CD1d (mCD1d) (23­26) have revealed how differences in the topology of their respective binding grooves enable them to have some degree of ligand specificity while maintaining their ability to present a diverse set of antigenic lipids (27). The initial structure of mCD1d revealed an overall fold similar to MHC class I proteins (23). The antigen binding groove had two deep pockets, designated A and F , which were lined with hydrophobic residues optimal for binding long hydrophobic chains, such as lipid tails. Structures for hCD1a and mCD1d complexed with glycosphingolipids and phosphatidylcholine more clearly elucidated the structural requirements for binding to CD1d (22­26). Here, we compared the antigenic potency and equilibrium binding of CD1d tetramers loaded with bacterial glycosphingolipid -galacturonosylceramide (GalA-GSL) with those loaded with a synthetic analog, galactose glycosphingolipid (Gal-GSL), which contains a galactose coupled to the bacterial glycosphingolipid and with those loaded with -GalCer, which allowed us to assess how differences in the lipid or carbohydrate moieties of this closely related group of glycosphingolipids influence avidity

and antigenic potency. We report the crystal structure of mCD1d in complex with GalA-GSL at 1.8 Å resolution that represents the first structure of a natural, microbial antigen bound to CD1d. This crystal structure sheds light into the molecular basis for its antigenic potency and provides structural information on the role of the ``spacer'' lipid in the A pocket, which is likely to be present when shorter chain lipid antigens are recognized. This study has subsequently led to the design and synthesis of glycolipids with biological activities that surpass -GalCer as measured by the production of IFN- and IL-4 in a cell-based assay. Results
V 14i NKT Cell Activation Correlates with TCR Avidity for Glycosphingolipid Compounds. The antigenic potency of the natural bacterial

antigen GalA-GSL was compared with the well studied V 14i NKT cell agonist, -GalCer (Fig. 1). GalA-GSL has several differences with -GalCer, including a galacturonic head group, in which the 6 -OH is oxidized to a carboxylate. The lengths of the fatty acyl moieties also differ; -GalCer has a C26 and GalA-GSL a C14 tail. Finally, the 4-OH of the sphingosine is absent so that GalA-GSL has a sphinganine base rather than the phytosphingosine in -GalCer. In addition, we also analyzed Gal-GSL, a biosynthetic precursor to the Sphingomonas glycolipid, in which the galacturonic sugar is replaced by galactose (Fig. 2C). Comparison of the V 14i NKT cell response to Gal-GSL with that of -GalCer can assess the effect of these lipid modifications. Similarly, comparison of the V 14i NKT cell response to GalA-GSL with that of Gal-GSL addresses any effect of the 6 -COOH modification of the sugar. The in vitro response of spleen cells from V 14i TCR transgenic mice to dendritic cells pulsed with these three compounds was analyzed. Secretion of IFN- and IL-4 was greatest in

Protein Purification and Structural Determination. Soluble heterodimeric complexes of mouse CD1d- 2 microglobulin (residues 1­279 heavy chain and 1­99 2 microglobulin) were secreted by Spodoptera frugiperda (SF9) cells upon infection with recombinant baculovirus and purified to homogeneity by affinity and size exclusion chromatography. GalA-GSL was loaded by incubating mCD1d with a 6-fold molar excess of glycolipid in the absence of any detergents. The GalA-GSL mCD1d complex was further purified by size exclusion chromatography. Using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method, the mCD1d glycolipid complex was crystallized, and its three-dimensional structure was determined by molecular replacement with the protein coordinates of the CD1d-sulfatide complex (Protein Data Bank ID code 2AKR) as the search model (Fig. 2 and Table 1, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site) (26) with the sulfatide atoms omitted. The crystal structure was refined to 1.8-Å resolution with Rcryst and Rfree of 20.8% and 24.3%, respectively. The mCD1d GalA-GSL Complex. The overall architecture is similar

to other CD1d complex structures previously described (22, 25, 26). mCD1d is a heterodimer composed of the 1, 2, and 3 domains of CD1 noncovalently associated with 2 microglobulin. The 1- and 2-helices sit atop a six-stranded -sheet platform that together form a deep and hydrophobic binding groove suitable for binding lipids (Fig. 2 A and B). Like -GalCer, the bacterial GalA-GSL is an -linked glycosphingolipid (Fig. 2C). The fatty acid and sphinganine tails of GalA-GSL extend into the A and F pockets, respectively, whereas the galacturonic head group is presented in the center of the binding groove at the CD1 surface for recognition by an incoming TCR (Fig. 2D). Several nonpolar, van der Waals' interactions between the GalA-GSL acyl chains and mCD1d stabilize the lipid backbone. The A pocket is larger than the F

response to -GalCer and was substantially reduced with GalGSL. A higher dosage (approximately two orders of magnitude) was required for cytokine responses that were equivalent to -GalCer. The GalA-GSL response was further decreased compared with Gal-GSL, especially at the lower concentrations of antigen (Fig. 1 Upper). Equilibrium binding of CD1d tetramers separately loaded with each of the three different glycosphingolipids was consistent with the functional studies. Tetramers loaded with -GalCer bound to the 2C12 V 14i NKT cell hybridoma with a Kd approximately 100-fold better than tetramers loaded with Gal-GSL. The combined data indicate that modifications to the ceramide backbone in the bacterial antigen have a substantial influence on antigenic potency and overall avidity of the trimolecular interaction of TCR, glycolipid, and CD1d. Previously, we showed that absence of the 4-OH alone had a relatively small influence on antigenic potency and a 5-fold effect on equilibrium binding of a soluble TCR or binding of CD1d tetramers loaded with this variant glycolipid to live cells (28). The shorter C8 acyl chain of PBS-25 and a C14 analog of -GalCer also did not cause a great decrease in antigenic potency (29, 30). Based on these findings, we conclude that the combined differences of the shortened acyl chain and the absence of the sphingosine 4-OH have a synergistic effect that is greater than the sum of the individual differences. A further decrease in both antigenic potency and avidity was measured by equilibrium tetramer staining when GalA-GSL is compared with Gal-GSL, indicating that the carboxylate modification of the galactose also is important for the overall trimolecular interaction. In conclusion, each of these substitutions distinguishes the natural bacterial antigen (GalA-GSL) from -GalCer and results in a significant difference in antigenic potency that is correlated with reduced TCR affinity.

pocket and can accommodate longer lipid tails. Extending into the A pocket, the C14 fatty acid tail initially follows a path perpendicular to the -sheet floor. The lipid tail then transitions into a circular path that runs parallel to the six-stranded -sheet and centers around Cys-12. The last four carbons of the C14 fatty acid tail wrap around the central pole in a counterclockwise orientation that is reminiscent of the circular paths around the central pole (Phe-70 and Val-12) in the CD1a and CD1b structures. An extensive hydrogen bonding network is formed between the polar functional groups of GalA-GSL and mCD1d. Asp-80 stabilizes the 3-OH of the sphinganine base while Thr-156 hydrogen bonds with the anomeric oxygen. As with the shortchain -GalCer analog PBS-25, Asp-153 hydrogen bonds to the 2 -OH and 3 -OH groups of the sugar moiety. No specific hydrogen bonding partners are observed for the galacturonic 4 -OH or 6 -COOH groups that accounts for its tolerance toward modifications at these positions (4 -OH axial to equa3974 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0600285103

torial and 6 -OH to 6 -COOH) for binding to mCD1d. However, the importance of these two positions for TCR contact is strongly suggested by their effects on antigenic potency. For example, -glucosylceramide, which differs from -GalCer only with regard to the orientation of the 4 -OH is a less potent antigen with a 10-fold reduced affinity for the TCR when bound to CD1d (28). Similarly, the 6 -COOH reduces the antigenic potency and TCR avidity compared with galactose, as detailed above.
Comparison of the GalA-GSL and PBS-25 Complexes. Both GalA-GSL

and PBS-25 are -linked glycosphingolipids, but the potency of PBS-25 is more akin to -GalCer. Although the two ligands are bound in a similar orientation by mCD1d, their structural differences can explain the dissimilarity in their biological activity (Fig. 3). The rms deviation between the GalA-GSL mCD1d and PBS-25 mCD1d structures is 0.43 Å for all C atoms. Thus, both proteins are structurally very similar. In terms of the hydrogen bonding network, differences arise mainly from

GalA-GSL containing a sphinganine (3-OH) tail, whereas PBS-25 has a phytosphingosine (3-OH and 4-OH) tail. In the PBS-25 structure, the phytosphingosine backbone is stabilized through interactions of the 3-OH and 4-OH groups with Asp-80. Arg-79 also is oriented so that it may participate in hydrogen bonding with the same 3-OH. When GalA-GSL is bound, the absence of a 4-OH causes the sphinganine backbone to orient itself slightly lower in the pocket to make optimal hydrogen bonds with the terminal oxygens of Asp-80. Thus, GalA-GSL sits slightly deeper in the groove, and the hydrogen bonding distance between the 3-OH and Asp-80 decreases slightly to 2.6 Å versus 2.8 Å in the PBS-25 structure. As a result, the hydrogen bond between Arg-79 and the sphinganine backbone is lost and Arg-79 is now oriented differently, possibly affecting its interaction between CD1d and the TCR. Despite these differences, the contacts between the 2-helix and GalA-GSL remain the same as seen with PBS-25. Asp-153 and Thr-156 still maintain extensive contacts with the sugar head group, anomeric oxygen, and fatty acid amide. The electron density for the galacturonic head group is not as well defined as for the lipid backbone. This observation, along with the higher B values, suggests that the sugar head group is not as tightly bound. However, attempts to model an alternative configuration were unsuccessful because of limitations of steric hindrance with the protein and the lack of any other obvious hydrogen bonding partners. Overall, the B values for the ligand are almost twice as high as the surrounding protein residues, which could also indicate that the binding groove is not fully occupied with GalA-GSL. Consistent with this hypothesis, refinement of the structure with 50% occupancy of the ligand resulted in comparable B values for ligand and protein. This lack of rigidity in the head group binding may directly influence the potency of GalA-GSL as a V 14i NKT cell agonist and explains why -GalCer, with its tightly bound galactose head group, is a much more potent NKT cell antigen.
Identification of the Spacer Lipid. Well resolved electron density for

electron density for a fatty acid. A library search of the GC MS fragmentation data identified fatty acid methyl esters myristic (C14:0) and palmitic (C16:0 and C16:1) acids. The presence of myristic acid was expected because it is released from GalA-GSL, and its detection then serves as an internal positive control for the experiment. No myristic acid was detected in protein samples, which were not loaded with GalA-GSL (data not shown). Palmitic acid (C16:0 or C16:1) could then be built with confidence into the electron density for the spacer lipid. The location and orientation of the carboxylic functional group could be established by the bifurcated electron density at only one terminus of the spacer lipid. Further computational analysis supported this conclusion because of favorable electrostatic interactions of the carboxyl with the backbone nitrogens of Val-29 and Trp-40, which can partially neutralize any negative charge on the ligand and contribute to its binding (Fig. 4A). Additionally, because of the high resolution of the data, Cys-12 was observed to exist in two alternate conformations (Fig. 4B). One of these conformation locates the free thiol closer to the fatty acid carboxylate and, thus, provides additional specificity for binding by the formation of an additional hydrogen bond. Discussion GalA-GSL was the first bacterial antigen described that can activate the majority of V 14i and V 24i NKT cells. Its discovery

a linear hydrophobic molecule occupies most of the circular groove in the A pocket. This previously unidentified spacer lipid was suspected to be a C16 fatty acid (25). To identify the chemical nature of the molecule, a sample of mCD1d loaded with GalA-GSL was refluxed in a solution of methanol HCl (29:3) to break fatty acid amide linkages and to methylate the free fatty acids. This method facilitated the extraction of all hydrophobic molecules into hexanes. The sample was then subjected to analysis via GC MS. The analytical GC MS data were in agreement with the observed

firmly established that NKT cells are able to provide an innate immune response to microbial antigens that is important for bacterial clearance and complements the other roles that these distinctive T cells play in autoimmunity (31, 32) and cancer (33). Thus, NKT cells are an attractive target for immunotherapy on the basis of their ability to rapidly secrete cytokines and modulate immune responses. As seen from the functional data, -GalCer is the optimal V 14i NKT cell agonist. Its crystal structure illustrates the importance of the 3-OH and 4-OH groups of the sphingosine base for orienting the sugar head group for TCR recognition (22, 25). However, in GalA-GSL, the absence of the 4-OH causes an overall shift of the lipid backbone into the CD1d groove so that the 3-OH retains the hydrogen bond with Asp-80, but loses the interaction with Arg-79. These result in an obvious change in the lateral disposition of the sugar head group in the binding groove. In addition, the lack of well-defined electron density for the sugar suggests that GalA-GSL has more flexibility in the binding pocket than -GalCer. Because the 6 -OH makes no direct hydrogen bonds with mCD1d residues, it is unlikely that the change from a galactose to galacturonic acid head group affects binding to CD1d. However, because the sugar 6 -OH is located on the face where an incoming TCR would likely make contact, the oxidation from an alcohol to a carboxylic acid changes the character of the recognition surface, consistent with the reduced antigenic potency of GalA-GSL compared with Gal-GSL. Furthermore, the changed orientation of the sphinganine in the groove and the alteration in the position of Arg-79, which is likely to contact the TCR (34), also most likely work in concert with the 6 -COOH substitution to affect the overall TCR avidity and antigenic potency of the Sphingomonas-related glycolipids. The fatty acid spacer lipid in the A pocket seems to be a conserved element when short chain lipids are bound to mCD1d (25). It may function in providing stability to the A pocket when the hydrophobic groove is unoccupied or until it is exchanged, presumably with the assistance of lipid-transfer proteins (35). The charge of the carboxylate is masked through electrostatic interactions with backbone nitrogens and possibly through hydrogen bonding with Cys-12. GC MS analysis showed the presence of palmitic acids (C16:0 and C16:1) that could be assigned to extra density in the A pocket. These fatty acids make up 40% (wt wt) of the total fatty acid composition in Sf9 cells used for CD1d expression (36). Whether the loading of a fatty acid in the A pocket is a consequence of the insect expression system used to produce the protein or whether it occurs naturally remains unclear. F pocket spacer lipids, although possible in unloaded CD1d molecules, are unlikely to exist when the pocket is partially or fully occupied by a lipid antigen. The length of the F pocket is optimal for a C18 chain, such as the sphingosine tail of -GalCer. For situations in which the F pocket is occupied by lipid tails of shorter length, such as the C9 sphingosine of synthetic analog OCH, the spacer lipid would have to be approximately C9 or less in length. Because fatty acids of such lengths comprise only a minor percentage of the total fatty acid composition of Sf9 cells, they are less likely to be acquired during protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. For V 14i NKT cell stimulation to occur, the TCR of a V 14i NKT cell must first recognize a bimolecular complex of antigen and mCD1d. The crystal structures of GalA-GSL and PBS-25 in their complex with mCD1d show how the optimal synthetic antigen uniquely assumes a rigid orientation of the sugar mediated by hydrogen bonds. The lateral shift of GalA-GSL caused by the absence of the sphingosine 4-OH in combination with the sugar 6 -COOH drastically impacts the overall potency of the molecule. Moreover, the binding of GalA-GSL alters the conformation of 1-helix residues likely to interact with the TCR. -Linked ceramide-based glycolipids may have immunotherapeutic potential.

NKT cell agonist relies on understanding the structural features that make -GalCer unique in its potency. From this structure, it is evident that the sphingosine 3-OH and 4-OH are vital for optimal glycolipid orientation in the hydrophobic groove. Galactose still remains unrivaled as the prototypical head group to maximize NKT cell activation. In contrast, the presence of a fatty acid spacer lipid stabilizing the A pocket suggests that the entire C26 N-fatty acyl tail of -GalCer may not be fully necessary to maximize activity. Previously, it has been reasoned that truncating the -GalCer fatty acyl tail diminished its potency (4, 30). However, based on this study, we have designed and synthesized -GalCer analogs replacing the C26 N-fatty acyl tail with a C6 ­10 N-fatty acyl tail and terminal benzene that exhibit higher potency than the parent compound (our unpublished results). It is thought that the interactions formed between the aromatic substituents of the glycolipid and aromatic CD1d side-chain residues contribute additional stability to the complex (Fig. 5). In summary, the studies here provide a structural basis for understanding the very different biological properties of synthetic and natural -linked glycosphingolipids and will aid in the future design of glycolipid immunomodulators.

Molecular replacement identified the space group as P212121 and was carried out in CCP4 with the program MOLREP (39), with the mCD1d­sulfatide structure minus the ligand (Protein Data Bank ID code 2AKR) as the search model, and resulted in a Rcryst of 46.1% and a correlation coefficient of 0.53. Subsequent rigidbody refinement in REFMAC 5.2 resulted in an Rcryst of 39.1%. The initial refinement included several rounds of restrained refinement against the maximum likelihood target in REFMAC 5.2. At a later stage of refinement, carbohydrates were built at two of the three N-linked glycosylation sites. The refinement progress was judged by monitoring the Rfree for cross-validation (40). The model was rebuilt into -weighted 2Fo Fc and Fo Fc difference electron density maps with the program O (41). Water molecules were assigned during refinement in REFMAC by using the water ARP module for 3 in a Fo Fc map and retained if they satisfied hydrogen-bonding criteria and returned 2Fo Fc density 1 after refinement.

GSL ligand were obtained from the CD1d-short chain -GalCer (PBS-25) structure (Protein Data Bank ID code 1Z5L) and modified accordingly by using the molecular modeling system INSIGHT II (Accelrys). The ligand library for REFMAC (42) was created with the Dundee PRODRG2 server (43). The CD1d­GSL 20.8% and Rfree 24.3%. The structure has a final Rcryst quality of the model (Table 1) was assessed with the program MOLPROBITY (44). The program PYMOL (45) was used to prepare Figs. 2­5. The program APBS (46) was used to calculate the electrostatic surface potential in Fig. 4A.
