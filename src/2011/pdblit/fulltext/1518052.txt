PATENT ABSTRACTS 8600077 HUMAN LEUKOCYTE ELASTASE INHIBITORS PREPARED FROM PYOGENIC BACTERIA AND METHODS FOR THEIR PURIFICATION Aaron JANOFF, Robert A SANDHAUS, Micha VERED assigned to CORTECH INC; Proteinaceous materials extracted from pyogenic bacteria, streptococci, staphylococci and Klebsiella species, act as specific inhibitors of human luekocyte elastase and may be used to treat deseases which include elastolysis as part of their desease processes e.g., pulmonary emphysema, adult respiratory distress syndrome and bacterial pneumonites. The proteinaceous materials extracted from the pyogenic bacteria can be conveniently purified by providing an affinity column by various novel methods such as the following five step methods: (1) binding elastin to an amnity column support material (2) binding human leukocyte elastase to the elastin (3) binding the human leukocyte elastase inhibitors to the elastase (4) eluting the affinity column with a first elution medium capable of separating contaminating substances from the inhibitors and (5) separating the inhibitors from the elastase by use of a second elution medium having a raised salt concentration.

GEL OF CROSSLINKED HYALURONIC ACID FOR USE AS A VITREOUS HUMOR SUBSTITUTE Tomas M@LSON, Bengt LH LINDQVIST, Frejs v@g 16, S-754 40 Uppsala, Sweden assigned to PHARMACIA AB A vitreous humor substitute intended for ophthalmological uses and consisting of a gel of crosslinked hyaluronic acid and a method at retinal surgery and after vitrectomy when the vitreous humor completely or partially is exchanged for such a gel. 4~71~ ATTENUATED SMALLPOX VACCINE STRAIN Kiyoshi Ooi, Michio Morita, Kazuyosh Suzuki. Soh Hashizume, Hanak Yoshizawa, Tokyo, Japan assigned to Chiba Prefectural Government The present invention discloses an attenuated smallpox vaccine strain exhibiting antibody production similar to conventional strains but without postvaccinal side effects. The vaccine is prepared by attenuating a Lister strain of a vaccinia virus by cell culture and selecting a suitable strain therefrom showing relatively small and uniform pocks on the chorioallantoic membrane of an embryonated egg.
