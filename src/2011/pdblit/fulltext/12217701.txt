1. Introduction The term biosensing is somewhat wide and ill-defined. It tends to cover various aspects of the recognition of biological events, using specially designed chemical probes and dedicated spectroscopies or imaging techniques. Considering for instance xenon which is at the center of this review article, methodologies based either on X-ray crystallography [1­4] or NMR using hyperpolarized xenon [5­13] take advantage of the hydrophobic character of the noble gas to detect, characterize and analyze apolar cavities of proteins. In such conditions, xenon itself represents the probe, i.e. a biosensor. Nevertheless in the field of this review article we shall focus on the use of laser-polarized xenon for the specific detection and imaging of biological receptors by NMR and/or MRI. Obviously, this concept belongs to the growing field of molecular imaging. This 129Xe NMR-based approach was initially proposed in 2001 by the group of Pines at Berkeley [14]. It takes advantage of the large sensitivity improvement allowed by resorting to spin-exchange optical pumping [15] for hopefully monitoring low-concentrated biological events. This approach remains an emerging domain: the proof of concept has not yet been established in vivo and therefore no in vivo experiment will illustrate this review. The aim of this research field is to evaluate the capability to use dissolved laser-polarized xenon as a tracer of specific pathologies. As xenon has no or low specificity for given biological sites (except N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [16]), the underlying idea of this approach is to transport it to the receptors by means of host molecules optimized for the noble gas encapsulation (Fig. 1). These host molecules will be functionalized in order to target specific receptors thanks to a recognition antenna of the peptide type for instance. As the electronic cloud of xenon is very polarizable, two particularities of this atom will be exploited: (i) its affinity for hydrophobic molecular regions, (ii) its chemical shift being highly sensitive to the local environment. In the 129Xe NMR-based biosensing approach, xenon magnetic resonance imaging will thus make use of the specific chemical shift signature of the encapsulated noble gas. Monitoring this signal xenon will enable localization of the host and therefore hopefully of the targeted receptors.

The availability of soluble hyperpolarized species usually enables two methods for imaging given receptors. In the first one, against-the-clock imaging starts just after introduction of the host­guest system. Because of the nuclear spin relaxation of the tracer, this approach is obviously limited to readily accessible receptors, or non-specific imaging (for instance, angiography with hyperpolarized species). The second method seems in our case more promising. Here, the molecule designed to host the tracer (here xenon) is first administrated. After it has reached the biological receptors of interest, the laser-polarized tracer is introduced, and MRI can start. Taking advantage of its gaseous and inert nature, the tracer can be added several times.

After having succinctly presented recent molecular imaging techniques based on MRI using contrast agents, we will give an overview of the use of hyperpolarized substances for MRI. The following section will describe the optical pumping step needed to produce laser-polarized xenon, emphasizing the spin-exchange method and comparing the use of laser or diode laser as photon sources. Section 4 deals with the choice of the xenon host system, focussing on the case of cryptophanes ­ the only xenon biosensors used so far. The unwinding of the experiment will then be envisioned: a survey of the methods used to deliver laser-polarized xenon for in vivo studies will precede a description of the NMR/MRI sequences that will be used to profit from the hyperpolarization. Finally, some biological systems serving as first models for the xenon biosensing approach will be presented.

lanthanides for which the pseudo-contact interaction term rather than the contact term induces a chemical shift variation of the resonance of the water molecules in their close neighborhood. Thus, a slow exchange at the proton chemical shift time scale is hopefully encountered on the 1H spectrum, and PARACEST (PARAmagnetic Chemical Exchange dependent Saturation Transfer) experiments can be envisioned. Such experiments, based on the continuous exchange of water molecules from the paramagnetic interaction sphere to the bulk, are described in detail in Ref. [22]. Finally the local contrast can be enhanced through an increase of lanthanide concentration by resorting to organized molecular systems such as micelles or liposomes [23]. This solution is becoming increasingly developed, also for superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. 2.2.2. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles The inherent low sensitivity of NMR has led to the research of systems offering high local concentration of tracer or contrast agents. In this sense, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO or USPIO for ultra-small), showing very high T2 contrast, are now widely studied [24]. The high concentration of ferromagnetic and/or antiferromagnetic substance creates a local magnetic field, thereby inducing strong transverse relaxation of the nearby protons. Whereas in the case of gadolinium chelates the dipolar interaction responsible for the increase of the proton longitudinal relaxation rates depends on rÀ6 (with r the distance between the proton and the gadolinium atom), here a rÀ3 distance law is encountered as it is a magnetic susceptibility effect which is responsible for the transverse relaxation. The in vitro efficiency of SPIO has been demonstrated, as well as their potentialities in terms of T2 relaxivity and specific absorption rates for magnetic hyperthermia [25]. Examples of targeting of specific biological receptors with functionalized nanoparticles are, however, scarce. As far as we know, only a few groups have proposed using particles on which proteins or antibodies are grafted, but these are at an early stage of exploration [26]. 2.3. Dissolved hyperpolarized species 2.3.1. Definition The term hyperpolarization refers to the out-of-equilibrium nuclear polarization obtained through magnetization transfer from a more ordered system. Several methods can give rise to such a state, among which:  Optical Pumping (transfer from the angular momentum of circularly polarized light), primarily applied to noble gases. This is the subject of the present article.  Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) where the electron polarization is transferred to the nuclear spins [27]. Here 13C is the main target, although other nuclei such as 31P, 89Y have been proposed [28­30].  PHIP (ParaHydrogen Induced Polarization) in which a chemical reaction renders magnetically inequivalent the two hydrogens anti-aligned in the para state, so that their polarization is transferred to the bonded atoms [31,32]. Generally 13C atoms profit from this hyperpolarization, but this approach has also recently been extended to 19F [33]. The common feature of these methods is that the transient character of the nuclear polarization gives rise to specific MRI approaches. A ``use it or lose it" strategy is required for the handling of the hyperpolarized species. Therefore specific protocols for delivery and dedicated MRI sequences will be used and these will be described in Sections 5 and 6. Even if protocols have to be changed, these species are attractive since the signal can be enhanced

2. Molecular imaging 2.1. Imaging methods For an early diagnosis the physician needs to confront several images from different techniques. There is a large interest in the radiologist, physician and pharmacologist communities for the development of new imaging approaches allowing localization and monitoring of specific cell receptors. Such images would allow early diagnosis or characterization of newly developed drug efficacy. The limitations of optical imaging (incapacity to image deeply buried organs, lack of quantitativity) and those of positron emission tomography (cost, bad spatial resolution, waste management) for instance have led to the conception and design of new ambivalent nanoparticles enabling multiple imaging approaches (see for instance [17,18]). MRI, although being one of the most insensitive techniques, possesses some unique specificities. Its multimodal character (i.e. its capacity to give complementary images of the same object by the choice of the contrast parameter) and its capacity to retrieve the chemical signature of some metabolites at defined anatomic regions (localized spectroscopy) render it very attractive for the detection and monitoring of biological events or diseases. 2.2. Molecular imaging via MRI The low sensitivity of magnetic resonance usually prohibits direct observation of cell receptors of interest. As a consequence, molecular imaging using magnetic resonance usually resorts to contrast agents such as lanthanide chelates or superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with targeted-receptor ligands to act on the proton relaxation rate of surrounding water molecules and thereby enhance the contrast image. We briefly discuss here these solutions, since, as we will show later, they have inspired some developments on hyperpolarized species. 2.2.1. Lanthanide chelates This research field has recently made a lot of progress. Obviously gadolinium and some other lanthanides are mainly used in MRI for their relaxation-enhancement effect on the water protons, inducing a strong T1 contrast on the images [19]. Functionalized Gd(III) based probes have been recently proposed. The above mentioned lack of sensitivity of MRI has led authors to monitor highly accumulated imaging reporters, such as those present on the avb3 integrin receptors, or to target transport systems, such as glucose or glutamine transporters whose accumulation indicates proliferative cells [20,21]. A new area has recently found interest in the MRI community. Instead of using relaxation promoters it has been shown that chemical shift reagents can be usefully employed. They also use

by a factor ranging between 103 and 5 Â 105 relative to the thermal equilibrium signal obtained in clinical MRI systems. This large improvement induced by the nuclear polarization can compensate for the low receptor concentration and explains the hope that this type of nuclear spin system could be used for molecular imaging applications. 2.3.2. Hyperpolarized 13C Magnetic resonance imaging using exogenous or endogenous substances possessing hyperpolarized 13C is still in the state of exploratory research but encounters a growing interest. These methods have been reviewed in Ref. [34]. The authors were able to perform angiographic imaging with DNP-13C enriched urea [35] or metabolic imaging monitoring DNP-[1-13C]pyruvate, DNP[1-13C]lactate and DNP-[1-13C]alanine [36]. DNP-[1-13C]pyruvate was also used to detect responses to chemotherapy in tumors where the induction of cell death results in decreased flux [37]. Another promising application has recently been proposed for the early detection of tumors, based on pH variations measured through the ratio of the signal intensities of DNP-½13 CHCOÀ and 3 13 CO2 [38]. 2.3.3. Hyperpolarized 129Xe Xenon has a van der Waals radius of 2.2 Å. This gas is already known in medical imaging: scintigraphy of the lungs using 133Xe isotope is now well documented [39]. Xenon is known to be a potent anaesthetic, according to its minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), a scale that assesses the in vivo potency of inhaled anaesthetics in humans [40]. It has been established that xenon acts by blocking the NMDA receptor, like nitrous oxide does. Below the concentrations where anaesthesia takes place, xenon is supposed to be a neuroprotective agent, interacting mainly with cytosolic globular proteins [41]. The MRI community uses the 129 isotope of xenon, of natural abundance 26.4%. This nucleus possesses a spin 1/2; therefore it presents a simple NMR signal which is less prone to relaxation than the 131 isotope. This hyperpolarized gas had been initially proposed for lung imaging [42], before being used for brain imaging [43,44]. Several groups have also used it for perfusion studies [45,46]. Finally let us recall that xenon is a fascinating client for NMR. For an inert atom, its resonance frequency can span a range of several thousands ppm [47]. Even the in vivo 129Xe spectra of rat head recorded in a 4.7 T imager display five resolved peaks assigned to gray matter, jaw muscle, fat tissue, white matter, and blood plasma [48]. In high-resolution spectroscopy, even the single deuteration of a xenon host system in discrete positions can cause a chemical shift variation of the bound xenon signal by several ppm [49]. This property has two consequences. Firstly, it will be a priori easy for the xenon chemical shifts to fall in the slow exchange regime suitable for the biosensing approach. Secondly, as already developed for optical imaging and very recently proposed for MRI using SPIO nanoparticles [50], the route is opened for multiplexed imaging where several spectral signatures are given by xenon in different hosts, thereby enabling the simultaneous detection of correlated biological events.

electronic polarization. In 1960, Bouchiat et al. showed that polarized alkali metals can transfer their electronic polarization to nuclear spins of a noble gas (3He) [52]. This principle, called ``spinexchange optical pumping", is the key method used to obtain hyperpolarized xenon [15,53­57]. In fact, there exists an alternative [58] to prepare hyperpolarized helium 3. This method, called ``metastability exchange optical pumping", takes advantage of the long lifetime of the 3S1 state of 3He, to allow the creation of super-hyperfine polarization (the use of a weak static magnetic field and low pressure forbids the separation between the nuclear and electronic spins). By collisions, the metastability is transferred to another atom while nuclear spins keep their polarization. A priori, this principle can be used for 129Xe. Nevertheless, its large number of electrons provides via spin-orbit coupling numerous relaxation pathways from its metastable state. This prevents the obtaining of large nuclear polarization via this method [59]. As a consequence, we shall in the following focus only on spin-exchange optical pumping of xenon, primarily employing an NMR point of view based on a spin-temperature approach, and orienting the reader interested in the atomic physical background to excellent reviews [60,15]. 3.2. Features of spin-exchange optical pumping Polarizing xenon nuclear spins by spin-exchange optical pumping of an alkali metal can be seen as a two-step process. The first step consists in obtaining a high polarization of the electronic spin of the alkali metal and the second one deals with the polarization transfer to the nuclear spin of the noble gas. This separation is allowed by the timescale difference between these two processes. 3.2.1. Optical pumping of an alkali metal In the presence of a static magnetic field, assumed to be of sufficiently large value (typically larger than 1 mT) and with a sufficient overall pressure for allowing one to disregard the correlation between the electronic and nuclear spins of the alkali metal [15], the electronic ground state of the atom (state 2S1/2) is no longer degenerate. This atom is irradiated by circularly polar2 S1/2 tranized light at a wavelength corresponding to the 2P1/2 sition between the ground state and the first excited state (transition D1 of an alkali metal). As a function of the sense of the circular polarization of the light (left or right), such a photon possesses a +1 or À1 quantum kinetic moment. This choice can be modified by changing the orientation of the quarterwave plate that transforms the linearly polarized laser beam into circularly polarized light and/or by changing the static magnetic field direction. As a consequence, only one out of the four electronic transitions (ms = ±1/2 to mj = Ç1/2), the one which conserves the kinetic moment, is allowed. As an example we shall assume in the following, as shown in Fig. 2, that the light polarization is r+, so that the only allowed transition is between the ms = À1/2 sublevel of the state 2S1/2 and mj = +1/2 of the state 2P1/2. Thus even if the linewidth of the illuminating light is not sufficient to resolve the two hyperfine sub-levels (ms = ±1/2), this quantum mechanical condition is sufficient to differentiate the four transitions. After having absorbed one photon, the atom is in its excited state 2P1/2 where it may exchange its spin-state by collisions (in our example from mj = +1/2 to mj = À1/2), but in any case it is going to relax towards its ground state either by emitting a photon of any polarization or by non-radiative de-excitation (see Section 3.2.5). As a consequence the final state of the atom can be either ms = +1/2 or ms = À1/2 with similar probabilities in the usual experimental conditions. Still continuing with our example, since only one of the two sub-levels (ms = À1/2) is able to absorb photons and the optical pumping process reorganizes the population on the two sub-levels of the ground state, by continuous light irradiation of

3. Preparation of laser-polarized xenon 3.1. General aspects In 1950, Kastler introduced the principle of optical pumping [51]. It consists in the selective enrichment of given atomic hyperfine sub-levels by circularly polarized light irradiation in the presence of a collinear magnetic field. This leads to the creation of net

The r+ transition is emphasized (r- appears here as a dashed line), as well as the collisional mixing and the de-excitation processes from the (mJ = +1/2) level of the P state to the two hyperfine sub-levels of the S state.

Fig. 3. Schematic representation of the two types of interactions between xenon and rubidium leading to spin-exchange cross-section. (a) Simple collision between these two atoms. The frequency of this type of event is high but the associated dipolar correlation time is very short. This process predominates at high pressure (>1 bar). (b) Three-body collision leading to the creation of transient Rb­Xe van der Waals molecules. The life time of these molecules depends on the overall pressure. It leads, at low pressure, to much longer dipolar correlation times and thus much more efficient spin-exchange mechanism, in particular for the Fermi contact contribution. Adapted from Ref. [15].

the pumping cell, one ends with a fully populated ms = +1/2 sub-level, i.e. a fully polarized electronic spin. Since only electronic processes are involved, this steady-state is typically reached in a few milliseconds. 3.2.2. Polarizing nuclear spins by spin-exchange By optical pumping, the electronic spin of the alkali metal can be fully polarized. Thus using NMR language, by any cross-relaxation process or ``spin-exchange" it affects the polarization of any compound present in the pumping cell and in particular of nuclear spins. Indeed in the gas phase, the electronic spin of the alkali metal and the nuclear spin of any foreign compound, such as xenon, are coupled by dipolar cross-relaxation. For the latter, one has to consider the general dipolar interaction, i.e. the usual dipolar interaction completed by the Fermi contact term which is needed to resolve the rÀ3 divergence of dipolar interaction at r = 0. It corresponds to local electronic spin density at the nucleus location [53]. These cross-relaxation phenomena are characterized by spectral densities (or spin-exchange cross-sections in term of atomic physics). They are consequently dependent on the molecular interactions between the foreign compound and the alkali metal, which can either be simple two-body hard-core collisions or three-body collisions leading to the intermittent creation of alkali metal/foreign compound van der Waals molecules (Fig. 3) [56]. The latter ones allow the increase of the dipolar correlation time and thus lead to more efficient cross-relaxation rates. In fact, by increasing the pressure a cross-over takes place from a dominant three-body process to the two-body collision model [61]. Also being related to spectral densities values, the cross-relaxation rates are magnetic field dependent [62­64]. Since the strong coupling between the alkali metal states and the beam light ensures a steady-state for the electronic polarization, due to these cross-relaxation processes, the nuclear polarization is driven out of its thermal equilibrium value towards a highly polarized level. Its characteristic rate is typically the longitudinal nuclear spin relaxation rate (see Section 3.2.3), i.e. its value can be several seconds or minutes. This a posteriori justifies the separation in two independent steps of the spin-exchange optical pumping mechanism. 3.2.3. Pumping rates This whole principle has been analytically formalized [55,57,15]. We shall here focus on a magnetic point of view and

on a restrictive description showing only the main features of spin-exchange optical pumping, considering the case of rubidium as the alkali metal and 129Xe as the noble gas to be polarized (Fig. 2). At steady-state, assuming pure circularly polarized photons and negligible thermal equilibrium polarization, the rubidium polarization is proportional to hSzi given by:

hSz i ¼ Æ

1 Cpump ; 2 Cpump þ RRb 1

ð1Þ

where ± accounts for the sense of the polarization, according to the selected transition (r+ or r-), RRb is the longitudinal self-relaxation 1 rate of the rubidium electronic spin and Cpump the optical pumping rate. The latter obviously depends on the density of circularly polarized photons nc relative to the rubidium density nRb. At steadystate:

with RRb the contribution of ``wall" relaxation (this term corresponds w to almost all relaxation mechanisms not linearly proportional to a chemical species density, for instance relaxation by diffusion in a magnetic gradient) [65­70], nXe RRb the contribution due to dipolar Xe coupling to xenon spins therefore proportional to the xenon density nXe. The sum corresponds to all other relaxation pathways involving every compound present in the pumping cell except xenon, each one being proportional to its respective density, ni.

the steady-state. Above an optimal temperature, which is dependent on the laser power, the medium is no longer sufficiently transparent to ensure rubidium polarization around 1 and the xenon magnetization decreases as a function of rubidium concentration, due to the increase of RXe . Finally 1 the rubidium polarization starts to be highly influenced by Rb­Rb interactions [91,92]. (5) It is finally important to notice that the temperature leading to the final highest xenon magnetization is different from the temperature leading to the highest xenon magnetization per time unit, since the increase of temperature leads to an increase of RXe and thus to a shorter pumping time (Eq. (8)). 1

To obtain a large xenon polarization consequently requires a long xenon self-relaxation time, a large rubidium polarization and a proper choice of the xenon concentration (nXe) and cell temperature (acting on the density of gaseous Rb nRb), since the latter directly influences xenon self-relaxation time (Eq. (5)). In fact other important remarks result from the examination of Eqs. (1), (2) and (7). (1) The expressions of the different rates have been investigated by Walker and Happer and their coworkers [54,56,57,64,72­ 75]. Even if rubidium initially appeared as the best choice, developments associated with the availability of new laser diodes have promoted other alkali metals such as potassium or cesium [76] or mixture of rubidium and potassium [77,78]. In any case, it remains very difficult to predict theoretically the spin-exchange optical pumping rate and the final xenon polarization [77] since, for instance, the contribution due to wall relaxation is always very difficult to estimate. An experimental optimization is always required. (2) Due to photon absorption along the optical pathway inside the pumping cell, the photon density nc varies in position and thereby the xenon and rubidium polarizations. Obviously any transport mechanism tends to obscure these variations. This phenomenon has been investigated by numerical simulations and experimental imaging techniques [79­84]. (3) Eq. (7) illustrates that at constant temperature and for welltuned pumping conditions i.e. high photon density relative to that of the rubidium, the xenon magnetization produced in a given pumping cell is almost constant, since it is proportional to nXehIziss. This property has been reported by different authors [85­88]. Increasing the xenon magnetization at constant laser power consequently requires accumulations of different batches prepared with a reduced xenon density or, at the limit, gaseous flow inside the pumping cell [88­ 90]. (4) The temperature of the pumping cell influences the dynamics of xenon polarization and the steady-state xenon magnetization through the rubidium density nRb. In the presence of a magnetic field the medium is relatively transparent to the beam light ðCpump ) RRb Þ, and an increase of temperature 1 induces an increase of rubidium magnetization and hence of xenon magnetization. But for a coated pumping cell it also leads to an increase of the xenon self-relaxation rate (Eq. (5)) and a shorter pumping time is consequently needed to reach

3.2.4. Spin-temperature description of spin-exchange optical pumping As spin-exchange optical pumping only involves populations, a qualitative description of the process can be achieved using the spin-temperature model. One starts with circularly polarized photons, which means, in term of energy and order, a bath at very low spin temperature. Due to the physical process of optical pumping, this photon bath is going to lower (in absolute value) the spin-temperature of the rubidium bath. Obviously the final spin-temperature i.e. polarization of the rubidium atoms is dependent on the heat capacity of the photons (essentially the number of photons) as well as the coupling magnitude between the rubidium atoms and the lattice, i.e. the capability to drive the Rb spin-temperature out of equilibrium (dependence on RRb ). Now this rubidium bath is coupled to the xenon spin 1 bath by any cross-relaxation mechanism and in particular the contribution of generalized dipolar interactions. Thus, the decrease (in absolute value) of the Rb spin-temperature is going to decrease (in absolute value) the Xe spin-temperature, i.e. the xenon nuclear spins are getting polarized. The capability to drive xenon spin-temperature very far out of thermal equilibrium directly depends on the heat capacity of the rubidium bath (spin-temperature and concentration) and on the coupling between the xenon spin bath and the lattice (xenon longitudinal self-relaxation). Thinking in terms of spin bath appears efficient for interpreting, for instance, the existence of a plateau in the amount of xenon magnetization achievable at a given cell temperature and laser power, or for drawing consequences on the final xenon magnetization when dark volumes are present (the final magnetization would be the weighted average of that in illuminated and non-illuminated areas) or when other compounds are added to the pumping cell. 3.2.5. Influence of experimental parameters Obtaining a large xenon magnetization, which is a key issue for biosensing applications, requires careful handling of different parameters. 3.2.5.1. Photon polarization. The experimental setup should be developed with particular care for the glass windows of the pumping cell to ensure the conservation of the light polarization. Radiative de-excitation of the alkali metal could be a source of wrongly polarized photons. Experimental conditions are consequently chosen to quench this de-excitation pathway. This is usually achieved by adding nitrogen to the pumping cell. The difference of energy between the 2S1/2 and 2P1/2 states of the alkali metal is then transferred by collisions to the vibrational degrees of freedom of N2 [60]. A nitrogen pressure of at least 50 torr is needed [93]. 3.2.5.2. Overall pressure in the pumping cell. Beside the temperature which defines the amount of alkali metal in the gas phase, the second intensive parameter is the overall pressure present in the

P. Berthault et al. / Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 55 (2009) 35­60

41

pumping cell. Its optimal value derives from a compromise resulting from five different phenomena. (1) The overall pressure is mainly defined by the line-width of the light source. Indeed the aim is to fully polarize the electronic spin of the alkali metal. According to Eqs. (1) and (2), this is achieved by increasing the number of photons. To reach the best results, the whole laser beam should be absorbed which requires that the absorption line of the alkali metal fits the line-width of the light source. Since it is hardly possible to affect the absorption line by the Doppler effect because increasing the temperature affects the alkali metal density, pressure broadening appears as the best solution. (2) The overall pressure affects the mechanism of interactions between xenon and rubidium and thus the value of the dipolar correlation time which is of key importance for determining the xenon­rubidium cross-relaxation rate. For instance, at high pressure, the mean duration between two collisions is short, resulting in the three-body mechanism being disfavored relative to the two-body mechanism. Moreover the number of collisions per unit time increases. (3) The overall pressure also affects the relaxation processes of xenon and rubidium. Indeed increasing the pressure reduces the mean free pathway thus reducing the effects due to wall relaxation. (4) Increasing the overall pressure allows one to reduce the contribution to xenon relaxation due to diffusion in a static magnetic field gradient by reducing the mean free path [70]. (5) Finally, high pressure disfavors doubly excited rubidium atoms [94] which prevent the obtaining of high xenon polarization.

3.2.5.3. Composition of the pumping cell. If the overall pressure of the pumping cell is defined by the laser properties, the surface coating quality and the magnetic field gradients, the definition of the gas composition results from a compromise between the induced relaxation properties of the different components (Eq. (3)). As shown by Happer and coworkers, among the compounds present in the pumping cell, xenon has the largest cross-relaxation rate with the alkali metal [56]. This means that it induces the largest decrease of electronic polarization (a parallel to nuclear Overhauser effect is illustrative: a given dipolar interaction contributes to cross-relaxation rate but always also to self-relaxation rate. The last contribution is always the largest one). Also, large xenon densities influence the xenon self-relaxation time through Xe­Xe interactions. Its clear influence on optical pumping can easily be checked by changing its isotopic enrichment. 129Xe appears as the worst (largest gyromagnetic ratio) but it is also the one which is needed for biosensing applications. Therefore for obtaining a large polarization, only some tens of torr of xenon can be pumped at the same time. Nitrogen, needed in the pumping cell for quenching radiative de-excitation of the alkali metal, is also a source of Rb depolarization due to relaxation with its nuclear spins and molecular rotational degrees of freedom. As a consequence, nitrogen partial density affects the self-relaxation time of the alkali metal. Happer and coworkers have shown that its contribution is smaller than that of xenon. Hence when high overall pressure (above 5 atm) is needed, resorting only to nitrogen for pressure broadening appears as less efficient than adding a third gas, helium-4, to the pumping cell [95,61]. Indeed helium-4 has no nuclear spin, a closed-shell electronic structure which ensures the smallest spin-exchange cross-section i.e. the lowest contribution to self-relaxation of the alkali metal electronic spin or of the xenon nuclear spin.

3.2.6. Recovery of polarized xenon after optical pumping After the spin-exchange optical pumping step, polarized xenon must be transferred to the NMR system of interest. Since in most experimental schemes the partial pressure of xenon in the pumping cell is limited to a few percent, gas purification and xenon concentration steps are suitable. This is usually done by taking advantage of the condensation of xenon at temperatures below $170 K. In this condition nitrogen and helium are evacuated to a pump and xenon is at the same time purified and concentrated as a solid. Cates and coworkers [96] have shown that relaxation of solid xenon in a field larger than 0.05 T is very long (self-relaxation time on the order of hours at 77 K). Polarized xenon can then be conserved and even different batches can be accumulated. Obviously using this principle of cryo-condensation, laser-polarized xenon can be transferred to any sample of interest without the need for an amagnetic compressor. Nevertheless this condensation needs care since it can induce a large decrease of the magnetization level. Xenon self-relaxation in the solid phase is very long only in a high magnetic field and at a temperature very close to that of liquid nitrogen [97]. The dewar, in which xenon is going to condense, has consequently to be very cold with a high heat transfer capacity to the liquid nitrogen bath. Permanent magnets can be used to increase the static magnetic field at the location of xenon condensation. They have strong gradients which can efficiently contribute to xenon relaxation by gaseous diffusion in a gradient. This explains why we prefer to resort to a liquid nitrogen-cooled solenoid. Very long xenon self-relaxation times in the solid phase also assume the absence of paramagnetic impurities. These can be located either on the dewar surface or in the bulk as alkali metal atoms can flow from the pumping cell. We (at least partially) solve the first difficulty by a very careful treatment of the whole glassware. For the second aspect, when working in batch mode, we cool down the pumping cell by flushing a large amount of nitrogen gas inside before expansion, then the gas mixture flows through a dewar at about 200 K to condense the remaining alkali metal atoms before reaching the dewar at 77 K. During the final step of the gas transfer, more nitrogen is added to the pumping cell to increase the overall gas pressure and to avoid a large contribution to relaxation due to diffusion in magnetic field gradients. 3.3. Optical pumping devices for xenon 3.3.1. Laser vs. diode laser Optically pumping the D1 transition of an alkali metal requires an intense light flux at a given wavelength in the infrared region. This can be achieved using either lasers (titanium:sapphire laser pumped by an argon laser for instance) or diodes. The final effect is the same, but the experimental conditions for both approaches differ largely because of their relative spectral line-width (usually less than 0.1 nm for lasers and around 2­3 nm for commercial laser diodes). As already discussed, this large difference induces very different gas compositions and overall pressures (less than 0.3 atm for laser and in the 4­10 atm for diodes). Also, the powers delivered by these two types of light source are largely different. Indeed a typical value for a continuous titanium:sapphire laser is a few watts, while power up to 210 W [87] has been used with diode arrays and commercial sources are on the order of 30­60 W. The operating conditions also differ in terms of temperature of the pumping cell. An intermediate solution is emerging but it is still not commercially available. It consists in a line-width narrowing of the high power laser diode by including the diode arrays in an external cavity [98­100]. Under these conditions powers up to 100 W can be obtained with a wavelength linewidth around 1 nm. Optimal overall pressures in the pumping cell remain in the atmosphere range. The limitations of a large size of the external cavity (>0.5 m length)

42

and poor cavity efficiency (<60%) have been recently circumvented by the use of tunable Volume Holographic Grating (VHG) [101]. The following paragraphs describe two types of experimental setups. They are typical of the two ways for spin-exchange optical pumping of xenon: batch mode with a titanium:sapphire laser, or direct mode on flow with a laser diode. 3.3.2. Batch production of hyperpolarized xenon with a titanium:sapphire laser Our apparatus is described in Fig. 4. Its first version has been described in Ref. [102]. In 8 years, it has obviously evolved allowing an improvement of the xenon polarization inside the high field NMR magnet from 15% to 50% at constant optical power. We report here the actual design. An ionized argon laser (continuous mode,

450­520 nm, model 2040 with beam lock from Spectra Physics) pumps a titanium:sapphire laser (Model 3900S from Spectra Physics). In routine experiments, our argon laser delivers about 25 W of green light which leads to 5 to 6 W of infrared light at the D1 transition of rubidium (794.7 nm). The light beam reaches a beam expander: its diameter passes from $1 mm to 20 mm (the diameter of the pumping cell). After the beam expander, the beam crosses a polarization splitter cube in order to ensure at its output a perfect linear polarization. Then a quarterwave plate transforms this linear polarization into circular polarization. The beam light reaches the pumping cell of cylindrical shape (25 mm inner diameter, 130 mm length, overall volume: 74 mL). The cell has a double envelope in order to be heated by a flow of hot nitrogen; the external envelope can be in part removed, allowing us to access the

exterior surface of the internal cell, for dispersing by heating rubidium metal in the pumping cell, for instance. The vertical glass walls of the external envelope are optical windows coated to minimize surface reflection at 794.7 nm. They are attached to the cell by teflon disks. The vertical glass walls of the pumping cell are of high quality but without optical treatment since this would have been destroyed during the sealing to the glass cylinder or the chemical treatment of the pumping cell. At the rear of the cell, the beam is reflected by a mirror and passes back across the cell. Both its propagation sense and its polarization being inverted, the remaining photons contribute to the optical pumping. Crossing another time the quarterwave plate leaves the final linear polarization orthogonal to that initially passing across it. The beam-splitter cube consequently deviates the beam trajectory towards a powermeter. The latter allows the fine wavelength tuning of the titanium:sapphire laser. This solution to drive the beam back into the pumping cell allows an increase of photon density but at a price of more complicated optical alignments. Lasers are more sensitive to fluctuations than are laser diodes. The profile and the output power of the titanium:sapphire laser is consequently continuously monitored by a powermeter and a laser beam profile analyzer (Newport LBP-1). The latter appears of key importance for ensuring an homogeneous beam profile which allows one to avoid dark areas in the pumping cell. At the same power level, the effect of inhomogeneities in the beam profile can be as large as a factor two in term of the final xenon polarization. The pumping cell is placed inside a 55 G magnetic field collinear to the beam created by five coils with an homogeneity better than 10À4 in the optical pumping cell volume. These coils of 720 mm diameter ensure the existence of a large volume of homogeneous magnetic field in which the whole glassware is located. In typical conditions the pumping cell is filled with less than 25 torr of xenon and $200 torr of nitrogen and heated at $368 K. If all photons at 794.7 nm are absorbed in the absence of magnetic field, in conditions of optical pumping (field on) the medium becomes transparent with a transmission equal to 80%-95%. By using a home-built cw NMR spectrometer working in the condition of adiabatic fast passage (Fig. 5), the typical longitudinal self-relaxation times of xenon inside the pumping cell were measured in the range from 1 to 3 min depending on the aging of the pumping cell. Accordingly when multiple batches are accumulated we use an optical pumping time of the order of 8 min per batch. Xenon is then transferred and accumulated in a Y-shape or U-shape tube acting as a dewar. The Y-shape tube fits inside the standard bore high field NMR magnet. It is consequently well adapted to experimental optimization of the optical pumping conditions. Nevertheless its use for routine biosensing experiments suffers from its interior capillary which cannot be heated very fast before xenon is transferred to the final NMR tube. This low heating process leads

to efficient relaxation due to slow xenon phase transition which reduces the final xenon polarization. We consequently resort to a Ushape tube which can be heated very fast by immersing it in hot water in the fringe field of the high field NMR magnet. Inside the pumping cell using a titanium-sapphire laser, nuclear polarizations as high as 0.7 have been reported [85]. With our apparatus we obtain polarization up to 0.5 (which means three out of four xenon spins aligned in the same direction), in the gas phase inside the NMR magnet (Fig. 6). Dissolution of xenon appears as a spontaneous but slow transient convection process [103] so we usually resort to strong shaking of the sample. Measurements have revealed polarization up to 0.3 for useful dissolved laser-polarized xenon. Our whole gas manifold is in pyrex. The whole glassware which is in contact with laser-polarized xenon (pumping cell, transfer tubes, dewar tubes, and the NMR tubes of interest) is carefully coated. The first step consists in a use of piranha solution (60% sulfuric acid 40% hydrogen peroxide) to remove any organic compounds on the surface. After careful water rinsing, the glassware is washed by HF solutions (10%) to remove metallic ions located at the surface. This allows also an increase of affinity of silanol groups at the air­solid interface. After water rinsing and overnight drying the glassware is coated using a solution composed of 10% surfasil in dry-toluene, rinsed and dried in an oven [65,104]. To avoid rapid degradation of the chemical surface, the temperature of the glassware is kept below 110 °C. Some years ago, we showed

that this coating of the NMR tube walls enables one to maintain the polarization for hours in gas phase and high magnetic field (T1 as long as 300 min) [102]. The exact values fluctuate from one tube to another due to the very large influence on RXe of any paramag1 netic impurity which, coupled to the efficient transport mechanisms for gas phase, acts as a magnetization sink. 3.3.3. Continuous flow of hyperpolarized xenon produced with a diode laser In fact with the commercial availability of laser diode arrays emitting at the rubidium or potassium D1 transitions, for about 10 years most experimental devices in the world are resorting to diode lasers as light sources [61,80,86­88,90,94,105­108] (non exhaustive list), the two main exceptions being Jänsch's apparatus [85] and ours [102]. In particular, Ruset et al. [86] have developed an apparatus dedicated to large production of laser-polarized xenon (Fig. 7). A great advantage of using diodes resides in the higher available power relative to laser which allows an increase of cell temperature and thus of the rubidium density. The concomitant increase of Xe­Rb collision frequency finally leads to a decrease of optical pumping time. As a consequence, it becomes possible to work in flow mode. Nevertheless three factors have to be taken into account in the design of the glassware manifolds. (1) A careful regulation of pressure and flow is needed to ensure that xenon spends the right amount of time in the pumping cell. This can be achieved by pinch valves, but the location of the measurement devices as well as of most of these valves has to be chosen carefully since they may induce fast xenon relaxation due to metallic parts.

(2) For an experiment being run at high temperature in flow mode, the gas mixture should reach the pumping cell with an adequate temperature and adequate rubidium density. A pre-heating volume is consequently needed. Also as the gas temperature at the output of the pumping cell is going to be high, a dewar is needed to condense the flowing rubidium vapor. (3) At high rubidium density, the optical transparency of the medium is usually low, thus the gas flow should be directed towards the laser diode output so that xenon flows in the direction of the highest rubidium polarization, as represented in Fig. 7.

4. Host systems for xenon After having described how the xenon nuclear spins can be polarized, we will now consider how xenon atoms can be directed toward the biological sites of interest. This section describes the general trends explored for the choice of a xenon carrier system suitable for the biosensing approach. 4.1. Choice criteria The criteria required for an efficient xenon biosensor can be summarized as follows: (1) Obviously exhibiting a high affinity for xenon. (2) Enabling an in­out exchange for xenon. This exchange must be fast enough to enable replenishment of the host molecule with laser-polarized xenon, but slow on the xenon chemical shift time scale. Also, a large resonance frequency difference between the signals Xe@blood and Xe@host is advantageous for selective excitation at the caged xenon frequency. In the biosensing approach, according to the magnetic susceptibility variation and the short transverse relaxation times encountered in the living tissues, a pronounced frequency difference between the two signals is mandatory. (3) Minimizing relaxation for encapsulated xenon. (4) In the multiplexing approach where several biosensors bearing different recognition antennae are used, displaying distinct chemical shifts for xenon in the different host molecules. (5) Transporting a high density of xenon towards the biological target. This implies that (an) efficient recognition antenna(e) must be grafted on the host. Also the question arises of whether a high number of xenon carriers would be preferable to a host molecule or nanoparticle containing many xenon atoms. These issues will be discussed further. (6) Displaying a different chemical shift for xenon in the host free and in the host bound to the receptor. This is a nonmandatory criterion. In 1998, the group of Rebek found that for single guest binding there is an optimal ratio of 0.55 between the guest size and the host cavity volume [109]. Given that the xenon van der Waals volume is 42 Å3, the optimal cavity volume is 76 Å3, i. e. a sphere of diameter 5.3 Å. Also the hydrophobic character of xenon must be taken into account for the design of the cage-molecule interior. A big part of supramolecular chemistry is today devoted to the design of host molecules or assemblies designed to encapsulate apolar neutral molecules, both for a fundamental understanding and for applications in the domain of catalysis, separation and sensors. For the specific case of gases, this research field is at an early stage, but xenon remains one of the favorite guests of the chemists

due to its solubility in many solvents and its wide chemical shift range. Rudkevich has reviewed the choice of the host molecules for gases [110]. The search for an ideal host for xenon has much in common with the design of a ligand structure to fit the 3D structure of a biological target. However, whereas the design of the ligand in the initial proof of concept is mainly based on bibliographic research, a wide research field is opened for the optimization of the xenon host structure. Intermolecular assemblies such as dimers made of self-complementary subunits as proposed by the group of Rebek [111], porphyrin cavitands [112] or peptide nanotubes [113] stabilized by hydrogen bonds have been discarded, as the biosensing approach needs to deal with very low host concentrations where these complexes will be disassembled. Also our initial studies of hosts exhibiting a high xenon affinity that led us to cyclodextrins and calixarenes were disappointing. The cavity of the smallest cyclodextrin (a-cyclodextrin, made of 6 glucose units chained in a 1­4) has a volume of 140­170 Å3, and therefore seemed the most appropriate in this family for xenon encapsulation. However, the reported value for the xenon binding constant is only 20 MÀ1 at room temperature [114]. Moreover, even though inclusion of xenon inside the cavity has been demonstrated through variation of its chemical shift with cyclodextrin concentration [114] and through polarization transfer experiments from laser-polarized xenon to protons (SPINOE experiments [102,115]), fast exchange conditions at the xenon chemical shift time scale are encountered. Cyclodextrins have the useful properties of being immediately water-soluble and less toxic than most other cage-molecules. However, for xenon biosensing, their use will in future depend on the capacity of grafting on bulky substituents in order to close the cavity and slow down the in­out exchange. This is also the case for calixarenes, which are known to interact with xenon in the solid state [116]; fast exchange conditions on the xenon chemical shift time scale were always encountered, not only for the derivatives we studied (unpublished results), but also for a calix[4]arene derivative soluble in water that exhibits a binding constant of $14 MÀ1 at 298 K in water [117]. 4.2. Hemicarcerands The molecular structures that give rise to slow in­out exchange conditions for xenon are more closed than these of cyclodextrins or calixarenes. They correspond to the family of molecular hosts termed hemicarcerands by Cram (carcerands are hosts that offer complete quasi-non-reversible entrapment of the guest, such as fullerene for xenon [118]). Among this family, we will now only describe the xenon hosts known to exhibit slow exchange phenom-

ena on the xenon chemical shift time scale, leaving aside potentially promising xenon host systems such as polypyrroles [119], cyclothiophenes [120], cavitand-porphyrins [121], etc. Also, the specific case of `constrictive' binding described by Cram et al. [122] which is intermediate (slow exchange on the xenon chemical shift scale, but with a half-life of Xe@host dissociation in CDCl3 at 22 °C of 47 h) will not be further described here. 4.2.1. Cryptophanes Most of the work dealing with encapsulation of xenon in cagemolecules has been performed with cryptophanes, as they exhibit the highest affinity with this noble gas ever reported. These cagemolecules, discovered by the group of Collet in 1981 [123], are made of two cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) units linked by alkoxy bonds as depicted in Fig. 8. Cryptophanes may exist as anti- or syn-topoisomers, according to the junction between the CTV units. Most of the variations on the structure concern the length of the linkers joining CTV units (m and n values) as well as substitutions on the aromatic groups in position R1 and/or R2 [124]. When m = n and R1 = R2, anti-cryptophanes are chiral whereas syn-cryptophanes (Fig. 8b) are achiral. If one of these conditions is not fulfilled, then the molecule is chiral in any case. Due to the lipophilic character of the cavity, cryptophanes are able to incorporate a wide variety of small neutral molecules [125,126], one of which is xenon [127]. As all cryptophanes so far studied act as hemicarcerands for xenon, the highest binding constant seems to be the best for biosensing applications. Because of their strongly aromatic nature, cryptophanes are not directly soluble in protic media. Numerous studies have been performed in halogenated solvents, and chemical modification is needed to render them soluble in water. 4.2.1.1. Affinity for xenon. Brotin and Dutasta found a linear relationship between the volume of the internal cavity of the host and the xenon binding constant for the four cryptophanes in the series {m and n from 2 to 3; R1 = R2 = OCH3} in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane [128]. Recently, xenon has been shown to exhibit a tremendously high affinity (estimated to 10,000 MÀ1 at 293 K in the same solvent, see Table 1) for the smallest cryptophane ever synthesized (m = n = 1; R1 = R2 = H) [129]. The ratio between the xenon volume and the cryptophane cavity size is 0.52, close to the optimal value of 0.55 predicted by Rebek [109], which explains this affinity. It is noteworthy that the smaller the cavity, the more selective the inclusion of xenon (most of the hydrophobic compounds of the body, such as lipids, will not enter the cavity of this cryptophane). For the chemists, the difficulty will be now to graft substituents onto this host to solubilize it in aqueous solvents and to incorporate the biological ligand (possibly after a hydrophilic spacer).

Fig. 9 displays the laser-polarized 129Xe spectrum of a mixture of xenon with cryptophane-A (i.e. cryptophane-222) and cryptophane-111 in an organic solvent. The same trend (increase of the xenon binding constant with decrease in the cavity size) is observed for a series of hexacarboxylate cryptophanes soluble in water (see Fig. 10). However, whereas the generic structure in Fig. 8 is depicted in crown­crown conformation (each CTV in a crown conformation), the CTV units may also exist in a saddle form where one of the dihedral angles linking two aromatic units is rotated by 180° [130,131]. The water-soluble equivalent of cryptophane-222, where R1 = R2 = OCH2COOÀ thus exists also as a crown­saddle conformation, unable to bind xenon [132]. It is possible to almost entirely recover the pure crown­ crown conformer by bubbling helium through the solution for several hours, or by pressurizing the sample with 4 bar of xenon for several days. Therefore, the useful crown­crown conformer, even if not always the most thermodynamically stable one, is kinetically stable for days. Slow formation of crown­saddle conformers should therefore not significantly lower the sensitivity of in vivo imaging based on cryptophane biosensors. The nature of the substituents on the aromatic rings in position R1 and R2 has also its own influence on the xenon binding constant. A significant increase of the xenon affinity seems to be reached in water when bulky and hydrophilic substituents are present, as evidenced by methods based on fluorescence quenching by xenon or isothermal calorimetry [134]. 4.2.1.2. In­out xenon exchange rate. Another essential parameter for the biosensor lies in the xenon in­out exchange rate. A rate lower

than the difference of resonance frequencies of caged and free xenon is mandatory. As later developed, the chemical shift difference is greater than 117 ppm for any cryptophane ever studied. That is, even with low field imagers of 1.5 T, the slow exchange regime stands as long as the exchange rate is slower than 2.1 kHz. This is always the case for the small cryptophanes (m and n 6 3). However, an exchange fast enough to enable replenishment of the cage with fresh laser-polarized xenon between rf irradiations can afford a further gain in sensitivity in the biosensing approach (this point will be detailed in Section 6). Given the criteria on the binding constant and the xenon in­out exchange rate, it seems that hosts based on cryptophane-111, cryptophane-A (or -222), and maybe cryptophane-223 (with R1 = R2 = OCH3, n = 2 and m = 3 on Fig. 8) are the best candidates for xenon biosensing. In tetrachloroethane, the xenon@cryptophane-111 dissociation rate is only about 40 Hz at 310 K under a pressure of ca. 0.5 bar, two orders of magnitude slower than for cryptophane-A in the same solvent. Such a slow exchange leads to a very sharp peak (see Fig. 9), inducing less blurring on the image, but requires a repetition time between selective pulses (see Section 6.3.2) of $100 ms instead of $10 ms in the case of cryptophane-A at room temperature. The nature of the substituents and the way they interact with the cryptophane cage also have an influence on the xenon exchange rate. As an example, the xenon release rates from two diastereomer compounds, camphanate-derivatives of cryptophane222, differ and are higher than that of cryptophane-222 [135]. 4.2.1.3. Relaxation of caged xenon. The longitudinal relaxation rate of encapsulated xenon is the third crucial parameter. Due to the exchange between free and bound states being faster than relaxation, its relaxation rate will be a weighted average of the relaxation rates in the blood and in the cryptophane moiety according to the respective molar fractions. The strong affinity of the noble gas for cryptophanes results in the residence times being long; it is therefore very important to work with a relaxation time of encapsulated xenon T caged as long as possible, ideally several tens of second. The 1 T caged values extracted for some organo- and water-soluble crypto1 phanes at room temperature are reported in Table 2. Inside the host cavity, xenon is stabilized in the vicinity of aromatic rings by London forces resulting in short xenon-aromatic protons distances. Moreover, the rigid character of the CTV moiety also increases the xenon-proton correlation time. The combination of these two phenomena tends to decrease T caged . Despite the three 1 protons present on each aromatic ring, cryptophane-111 induces

Therefore, changing the nature of the cryptophane substituents may be an interesting way of performing multiplexing with a reduced influence on the thermodynamics and kinetics of the xenon@cryptophane binding. It was reported that the xenon chemical shift varies by 1.19 ppm between cryptophane-222 and its congener deuterated on dioxyalkyl linkers and methoxy substituents [49]. Other congeners partly deuterated at these locations also reveal intermediary chemical shifts for encapsulated xenon. These observations have been rationalized in terms of the smaller amplitude of C-D stretches and other modes such as bond angle deformation, compared to C-H ones [138]. It appears that using isotopomers for multiplexing purposes seems practically unrealistic. 4.2.2. Cucurbiturils Cucurbiturils are synthesized by reaction of glycoluril derivatives with formaldehyde in strong acidic conditions. Their generic structure is depicted in Fig. 11. The cucurbit[n]uril family (CB[n]) covers a wide range of molecules of different cavity sizes (n = 5, 6, 7, 8, 10) from 82 to 870 Å3. Given these values, the smallest one, CB[5], might seem the most adapted for xenon encapsulation. However, these molecules are very rigid, and the portal size, defined by the oxygens of the carbonyl groups, limits the size of the molecules able to enter the cavity. As an example, Miyahara et al. [139] have remarked that heating to 80 °C is necessary in order to encapsulate xenon in decamethylcucurbit[5]uril. As a consequence, CB[6] and derivatives seem more appropriate for the xenon biosensing approach. The interaction of xenon with CB[6] has been studied via 1H- and 129Xe-NMR by El Haouaj et al. [140]. A binding constant of 200 MÀ1 has been estimated for such a complex in aqueous acidic solution. Starting with cyclohexanoglycoluril the group of Kimoon Kim has synthesized a cucurbit[6]uril derivative soluble in water at neutral pH [141]. More recently, the same group has shown that a xenon binding constant of 3000 MÀ1, measured by isothermal titration calorimetry, is achieved with this host, potentially constituting the basis of an effective 129Xe NMR-based biosensor [142].

a moderate xenon relaxation rate. This may come from the reduced number of protons on the linkers, 2 instead of 4 per linker for cryptophane-222, and to the fact that these protons point toward the exterior of the cavity, increasing the xenon-proton distance and thus limiting cross-relaxation with xenon [136]. In order to decrease these relaxation rates, deuterated linkers and O-acetate substituents of the hexacarboxylate form of cryptophane-222 have been introduced, inducing an increase of xenon T1 by almost 50% [132]. Therefore, on the T1 point of view, the best host molecule for xenon biosensing applications would probably be based on a cryptophane deuterated at the linkers, aromatic rings, and other sites close to the bound xenon. An alternative to deuterated samples would be biosensors based on a cryptophane-111 core, bearing substituents on the aromatic rings. 4.2.1.4. A range of chemical shifts for a multiplexing approach. In the initial publication on xenon biosensors [14], it was proposed to use sequentially or even simultaneously several probes. This multiplexing approach would allow one to obtain specific images based on differences in xenon chemical shifts, when the noble gas forms complexes with different biosensors addressing different targets. Chemical shift variations may then come from the cryptophane cage design, the choice of directly attached substituents and the nature of the linkers between the xenon host molecule and the biological ligand. The most important variations refer to differences in cryptophane cage volumes (see Table 1). For example, the bound xenon chemical shift is extremely sensitive to the size of the cavity. It increases when the length of the cryptophane linkers decreases, as observed for series of organo-soluble [128] or water-soluble cryptophanes [132]. A difference of 29 ppm between the watersoluble equivalents of cryptophane-222 and cryptophane-333 (with R1 = R2 = OCH2COOÀ) has been reported [132] and rationalized through ab-initio calculations [138]. Unexpectedly, the smallest cryptophane ever discovered, namely cryptophane-111, shows a 37 ppm upfield shift for its complexed xenon compared to its value in cryptophane-222 in organic solvent. Such a difference represents about 700 Hz at 1.5 T. As both cryptophane-111 and -222 seem to be valuable for biosensing applications, simultaneous imaging based on xenon encapsulated into these two molecules might be only slightly more challenging than the use of only one of these molecules (see Section 6.3.1). The chemical shift of caged xenon may also be tuned by the choice of the substituents. As an example, when methoxy substituents of cryptophane-222 are replaced by hydrogens, a bound xenon high field shift of 16 ppm occurs at room temperature in tetrachloroethane [136]. If only one CTV carries methoxy, the shift is still 10 ppm. On the contrary some substituents like butanoates induce a much smaller variation of xenon chemical shift (about 1 ppm). Even monosubstitution by a chiral molecule such as camphanate on a mixture of both cryptophane-222 enantiomers influences the bound xenon chemical shift, as a difference of 7 ppm is observed between both diastereomers, one of them being down-field shifted by 10 ppm compared to cryptophane-222.

For the biosensing application, an interesting property of this family of molecules (apart from their synthesis, involving less steps than that of cryptophanes) resides in the slow exchange encountered in the 129Xe spectra, as well as the chemical shift for bound xenon, being very different (at least for Xe@CB[6]) from that of xenon encapsulated in cryptophanes (around 100 ppm for the former vs 60 ppm for the latter). Also it is interesting to note that few protons can contribute to the relaxation of bound xenon (the only protons present in the molecule point away from the cavity, and thus are far from the xenon atom). An effort will need to be made in order to render these hosts soluble in aqueous solution at neutral pH, maybe following the approach of Kim et al. [141]. Given that most of the cryptophanes synthesized so far are only soluble in organic (and halogenated) media but can become water-soluble via the grafting of hydrophilic tethers, the same approach might be used with these host molecules: an appropriate tether could help to solubilize the whole cucurbituril biosensor at physiological pH. 4.3. Dendrimers As inspired by other molecular imaging studies by MRI, a complementary way of increasing the sensitivity of the 129Xe NMRbased biosensing approach is to increase the local density of tracers. Following this idea, Mynar et al. [143] proposed a construct in which cryptophane cages are bound through acid­base and hydrophobic interactions to dendrimers. They succeeded in coupling up to 11 cryptophane-222 cages to a polyamidoamine dendrimer of the 5th generation (G5 PANAM). After reduction of the central disulfide bond of G5 PANAM, and grafting of a biotinylated linker, the molecule was bound to avidin. On average two cryptophane222 were encapsulated into the dendrimer. Taking advantage of an indistinguishable chemical shift for xenon caged into both cryptophane enantiomers, and thanks to sharper xenon signals, the sensitivity was increased by a factor of 8 with respect to the corresponding xenon biosensor made using a single cryptophane-A bearing a biotin ligand. Therefore, provided that biological targets are sufficiently dispersed, dendrimers may be very useful for enhancing the contrast in 129Xe NMR-based biosensing applications. 4.4. Porous materials Mesoporous (pores between 2 and 50 nm) and microporous (pores smaller than 2 nm) particles have very large specific surfaces and are the subject of intense research, mainly for their potential as supports for catalysts. Their capacity to incorporate large quantities of small molecules has led to the idea of using them as xenon carriers for solution-state experiments. Recently a similar approach has been proposed with the use of mesoporous particles with Gd chelates grafted inside the pores in order to design highly efficient contrast agents [144]. The numerous studies using thermal [145] or laser-polarized [108] 129Xe NMR to characterize the porosity of such materials have emphasized the richness of this nucleus as a spy. In such studies, slow exchange phenomenon between free xenon and xenon embedded in pores is observed, the chemical shift value of the latter being, with certain precautions and limitations, proportional to the size of the pores [146]. Transporting embedded xenon towards biological targets implies functionalization of the surface of the particles (and then transforming them into biocompatible objects). Therefore a dedicated chemistry has to be developed for this purpose. In an attempt to develop such an approach, Lerouge et al. have prepared silicalite 1 [Si96O192] colloidal nanoparticles (65 nm in diameter) with a narrow size distribution [147]. Their channels have a diameter of 5.6 Å and their BET surface amounts to 404 m2 gÀ1. The colloidal

stability and biocompatibility of these particles has been ensured by grafting polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups onto their surface. The particles have then been functionalized by the following procedure. Firstly, silane coupling agents bearing semi-carbazide groups have been grafted on the surface of the particles. This enabled the second functionalization step, consisting in the specific anchoring of the recognition antenna. As a proof of principle, a 14-residue peptide, the FX13 factor for the specific detection of thrombi, has been chosen, and in vivo assays are underway. Fig. 12 displays the 129Xe spectra obtained with laser-polarized xenon dissolved in water with suspensions of functionalized silicalite 1 nanoparticles, revealing a slow chemical exchange case. Although the affinity of xenon for these nanoparticles has not yet been estimated, it is interesting to note that the small diameter of the channels (Rebek's ratio of 0.5) will enable a selection of the guest size. However, the high tortuosity of these materials leads to a very slow exchange of incorporated xenon with the bulk. Therefore, either these materials will be used in a one-shot xenon imaging approach, or the same strategy for particle coating will be used for mesoporous materials exhibiting larger pores. 5. Methods for xenon delivery Whereas xenon in the gas phase after optical pumping can have nuclear polarization on the order of 0.5, its delivery to the system under study can encounter severe losses of polarization. The relative difficulty of dissolving this hydrophobic atom into biological or body fluids has led to various solutions that differ depending on whether one deals with in vitro or in vivo applications. 5.1. In vitro experiments For in vitro experiments, the main requirement, in addition to an efficient transfer of hyperpolarized xenon from the gas phase, is the maintaining of sufficient spectral resolution. The presence of bubbles due to an insufficient solubility of the noble gas in aqueous solution may occur in all protocols and can lead to impaired spectral resolution due to magnetic susceptibility variation. In fact, for the introduction of xenon the encountered situation varies

The xenon to particle concentration ratio is about four times higher in (b) than in (a). The chemical shift variation of the signal of xenon inside pores between spectra is because the gas explores different internal regions of the material.

according to the system being studied. For experiments with a biological solute not too sensitive to freezing conditions, paramagnetic oxygen and other dissolved gases can be removed through successive free-pump-thaw cycles. Polarized xenon can then be added either using a simple Joule­Gay Lussac expansion (at the cost of a reduced final overall pressure) or through xenon freezing by using a cold point above the solution. For this last solution we have employed a hollow spinner which fits the NMR tube and can be filled with liquid nitrogen in the fringe field of the magnet (larger than 500 G) in order to keep the xenon polarization. Hot water is then used to ensure a fast sublimation of xenon and thus avoid relaxation during phase transition. Finally xenon dissolution is artificially accelerated by shaking the tube. Even if these solutions for transferring xenon prepared in batch mode to the NMR tube of interest can anyways be used, the straightforward extension of this protocol to studies of cell cultures or organ fragments is difficult for several reasons. First, a previous degassing by freeze-pump-thaw method cannot be applied without risk to the biological material. Second, a vigorous shaking is hardly suitable for living matter. An alternative method for degassing the sample consists in bubbling in helium or argon for a while, then expanding the gas volume on top of the solution into a large volume, before adding polarized xenon. Also direct xenon bubbling can provide a solution. This can only be performed using a syringe or a peristaltic pump to create a pressure differential. This appears more straightforward for experiments where xenon is polarized in flow mode. Hence the group of Pines has developed such a device installed in the bore of a high resolution magnet [148] (see Fig. 13). It allows the delivery of xenon with constant flow and quasi-constant polarization level, which represents a clear advantage for special assays. Injection of microbubbles of hyperpolarized xenon into the solution through bundles of microcapillaries has been shown to be more efficient than using a glass frit with small porosity. During the NMR experiment, however, the flow must be switched off to maintain the spectral resolution, which otherwise would be reduced by the large change in magnetic susceptibility at the gas/liquid interface. An alternative solution was presented by Baumer et al. [149], who have proposed a system using commercially available hollow-fiber membranes. Such a system avoids the formation of bubbles and foam, and therefore preserves the spectral resolution without the need for interrupting the flow. The dissolution process occurs much faster than the xenon relaxation time, thus maintaining a maximum polarization in the dissolved state.

5.2. In vivo experiments For in vivo studies, the xenon delivery routes can be classified in two categories, inhalation via the respiratory system and injection methods using a biocompatible solvent. Both methods have their own advantages, depending on the objectives of the study. As noted by Lavini et al. [150] in the case of brain imaging, inhalation and injection modes lead to similar sensitivity when dealing with hyperpolarized 129Xe. 5.2.1. Inhalation The simplest way to deliver a gas in a living body is by the respiratory system. Therefore, the first organs observed through hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI were lungs [42]. Imaging these organs using 1 H MRI is challenging due to the low proton density, the very short T Ã encountered, and the consequences of cardiac and respiratory 2 movements [151], and thus hyperpolarized gases are thought to represent a way around these problems. 3He is generally preferred for lung imaging, but 129Xe images of lungs of small animals [42,152­155] and humans [44] as well as human oral cavity [156] have been reported. For xenon one can take advantage of its inertness and of its capability to cross the pulmonary epithelium to dissolve in blood. The protocol for xenon inhalation depends on whether it is administered to humans or animals. For animals, the generally employed strategy consists in anaesthetizing and then intubating the animal with a catheter. Then, the hyperpolarized noble gas is introduced either directly from a plastic bag, or via a syringe, or by using a triggered ventilator system [157]. Experiments using spontaneous respiration of 129Xe on small rodents have also been performed [153,158] to analyze the washout process of the noble gas. For humans, the protocol generally employed consists in a volunteer inspiration of one or several boli of 129Xe, possibly followed by a bolus of air. The volunteers hold their breath during the experiments [44,159]. Given that the noble gas takes 1­2 s to cross the haemato-encephalic barrier, inhalation could in certain cases represent a viable solution for brain imaging, and images of white and gray matter of a rat have been successfully obtained using this method [43]. 5.2.2. Injection Although more invasive, the injection of hyperpolarized xenon in a dedicated carrier agent may be preferred because it represents a more direct way than the inhalation mode. An ideal carrier agent should be biocompatible, be a good solvent for xenon and limit its longitudinal relaxation rate in order to preserve its hyperpolarized state. A saline solution has been used despite the very low solubility of xenon, because of the very long T1 of xenon. Intralipid emulsions consisting of aqueous suspensions of lipid vesicles of approximately 100 lm in diameter have also been used at concentrations of 20% or 30%. The xenon solubility is much greater than in the saline solution and xenon T1 is still long enough to preserve most of its polarization during the transport through the blood circulatory system. Images, more particularly devoted to brain studies, have been recorded after injection of intralipid solutions [46,160­162]. Perfluorocarbon compounds and their emulsions have also been tested as potential xenon carriers. Because of their inertness and their capacity to solubilize and transport both oxygen and carbon dioxide [163], they are considered as potential blood substitutes. The first attempt was made using Fluosol (GreenCross), a perfluorodecaline emulsion. It was observed that when a Fluosol emulsion containing xenon is added to freshly prepared blood, the T1 of xenon in blood increases. Xenon solubility in another type of perfluorocarbon, namely perfluorooctylbromide (PFOB), is very high and its longitudinal relaxation time quite long (83 s in vitro [164]). To facilitate tissue absorption, an emulsion

form of PFOB has been proposed with L-a-lecithin from fresh egg yolk phospholipid (EYP) as an emulsifier in water. An optimal proportion of EYP in a water emulsion of PFOB has been proposed in order to get droplets sufficiently large to reduce the xenon exchange rate with the surroundings (a source of broadening of the corresponding xenon signal) while maintaining an acceptable droplet stability. Spectra of 129Xe dissolved in PFOB emulsions injected in the tail vein of a rat [165] and dissolved in fresh human blood have been also recorded [164]. These results have been rationalized from a theoretical point of view, from which the droplet size and permeability have been evaluated [166]. Sucrose octaoleate-F104 emulsions have also been proposed as potential carrier agents, despite the lower T1 of xenon (15 s in vitro) in these systems. Liposomes of 8 ± 2 lm size containing hyperpolarized 129Xe have been tested in fresh blood, and in vivo in the tail vein of a rat. Quite long T1 values were observed (respectively 47 s and 54 s) providing some optimism for the use of such carriers. 129Xe dissolved in microbubbles of Echovist (Guerbet) was also tested in vitro and a T1 value (20 s) acceptable for in vivo applications was reported [162]. 5.2.3. Blood-dissolved xenon After injection or inhalation, before reaching the biological target, hyperpolarized xenon biosensor will follow the vascular system. Here, efficient xenon relaxation can occur not only because of its interaction with the cage molecule used as transporter but also, and mainly, due to chemical exchange with the species present in the blood and in particular with paramagnetic haemoglobin. The relaxation time of xenon dissolved in blood has been the subject of controversies, but it seems now established and accepted that counterintuitively it is longer in oxygenated blood: Bifone et al. have reported values of xenon T1 of the order of 4 s in deoxygenated blood, and 6.4 s in oxygenated blood [167,168], at 310 K and 1.5 T. It has therefore been proposed to inject in the body a saturated biocompatible solution able to dissolve a large quantity of xenon while extending its relaxation time to minutes.

6. NMR and MRI methods 6.1. NMR with hyperpolarized species Dealing with hyperpolarized species in NMR requires one to adapt the pulse sequences. Indeed the strong xenon magnetization can induce non-linear effects (radiation damping and distant dipolar fields [169]) which for instance require the use of special inversion pulses [170]. Also, the excitation pulses tend to decrease the available xenon magnetization. As a consequence, the use of full phase cycling is usually prohibited. Obviously, some of these restrictions can be removed by resorting to a flow of polarized xenon inside the NMR sample, affording a quasi-constant polarization level. Considering that the sensitivity detection limit of classical NMR is close to 1017 spins and that optical pumping gives signal enhancement by a factor of 104 À 105, it is expected that 1013 spins per scan can be detected in experiments with hyperpolarized species. Obviously this value has to be adjusted according to the magnetic field, the quality and filling factors of the NMR probe head and the resonance linewidth. It remains that for the in vitro biosensing approach the required number of spins is still large compared to the number of cell receptors which can fill the volume covered by the detection coils of a narrow bore spectrometer. Taking as an example the transferrin receptors, very abundant on the surface of certain cells (on the order of 105 sites per cell), and considering that the density of living cells in a suspension can reach 108 per mL without too much risk of damaging their integrity, this gives a total

of 1013 spins that have to be detected. Obviously, as it is xenon which is detected, as described in Section 4, specific constructs such as dendrimers, or grafting of several xenon hosts per ligand can increase the number of spin carriers, but in any event the situation is not comfortable in terms of sensitivity. Indeed other possibilities such as xenon line broadening due to magnetic susceptibility effects can also occur to further dwarf the signal. Luckily for laser-polarized xenon biosensors, this limit can be improved by taking advantage of the xenon exchange between two environments (free and encapsulated). Indeed, the magnetization of free xenon can be used as a reservoir connected to the magnetization of caged xenon [171]. Two methods have been proposed to achieve this purpose. In the first, frequency-selective 90° excitations at the caged xenon resonance are applied with a high repetition rate. This direct method has been used to detect xenon in a biosensor at very low concentration [132]. Fig. 14 displays the high-field region of the 129Xe spectrum of the noble gas encaged in a cryptophane at a concentration of 12.8 nM (5 pmol of the host molecule in the NMR tube) obtained in a few minutes. If the caged xenon signal is too broad, an alternative method can be applied, consisting in a selective saturation of the NMR resonance, and using a difference spectroscopy with an off-resonance saturation experiment, to observe the variation of the free xenon signal intensity [171]. The advantage of this saturation approach resides in its potentially higher sensitivity. Indeed, if the exchange is fast, a very large numbers of xenon atoms are going to enter the host during the rf saturation period, thus the free xenon signal is going to be strongly reduced compared to the reference signal. A difference between two large and sharp signals is consequently measured, while only two scans are recorded so that the noise remains limited compared to classical signal averaging. On the other hand, this difference spectroscopy requires the obtaining of a constant magnetization level, which can hardly be reached even by using a constant flow of polarized gas. Also, the spectral information of the bound xenon is only recovered after a reorganization of the acquired spectra [172]. In this article, the simulations show that indirect detection has theoretically an advantage at very low concentration, but the authors point out that the presence of multiplicative noise can account for up to 20% uncertainty in the acquired signal, which limits the applicability of such an approach. Methods to measure the xenon in­out exchange rates have been suggested, based on the above considerations on the capability of replenishing the caged xenon resonance or altering the free xenon signal by selective irradiation [171].

6.2. MRI sequences for hyperpolarized species Among the MRI methods available to sample the reciprocal kspace, we shall restrict our description to those which are the most adapted to hyperpolarized species. As a consequence of their outof-equilibrium character, MRI experiments dealing with these species usually employ fast acquisition methods. Obviously, the difficulty of properly inverting the xenon polarization [170] leads to a minimization of the number of rf pulses per acquisition, and for instance to a preference to use gradient echo techniques rather than spin echo techniques, although the former are more subject to artifacts arising from chemical shift and magnetic susceptibility variations. At first glance, the Fast Low Angle Shot (FLASH) sequence [173] and its derivatives can be used to sample the k-space. Indeed the FLASH sequence has been proven to be very useful for experiments employing the hyperpolarized gas administered in a bolus. Nevertheless, the choice of the flip angle has critical consequences on the image quality and moreover the repetition of rf excitations of flip angle h diminishes the longitudinal magnetization. After n excitations, it becomes:

demonstrated for 13C imaging [35,175]. In the trueFISP implementation, a careful setting of the pre-excitation pulse ensures that an apparent steady-state of the magnetization is obtained in the shortest amount of time. Finally thanks to the recycling of the slowly-decaying transverse magnetization, excitation pulses of flip angle larger than in the FLASH approach can be used. In the classical FLASH or trueFISP implementation, during the acquisition a read gradient pulse ensures sampling of one line of the reciprocal space. Obviously for the detection part, the use of specific Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) techniques and derivatives, in which one acquisition is sufficient to cover the whole Fourier plane, are of great interest here. Recently, a double spin-echo sequence with EPI-type detection has been proposed for fast spectroscopic imaging of metabolites enriched with 13C hyperpolarized through DNP [176]. 6.3. Specificity of MRI of encapsulated xenon In the laser-polarized xenon biosensing approach, one has to face low concentrations due to the low solubility of the tracer and/or the restricted amount of available cell receptors. The explored solution involves taking advantage of the chemical exchange between free and caged xenon, as for spectroscopic studies. Direct (through fast gradient echo imaging) or indirect (through HYPERCEST) monitoring has been proposed. 6.3.1. Fast gradient echo imaging In our case of a 129Xe NMR-based biosensor, permanent in­out exchange of the xenon enables the constant renewal of signal at the resonance frequency of encapsulated xenon (hereafter named Xe@host). Therefore resorting to small flip angle pulses as in the FLASH approach is not required for this spectroscopic imaging approach. When no or only thick slice selection is needed, a straightforward solution consists in lowering the slice selection gradient in a simple fast gradient echo experiment, and adjusting the soft pulse shape and duration in order to selectively excite the Xe@host frequency. A further improvement of the approach is given by the use of centrically ordered phase encoding gradients instead of a linear gradient ramp. As the acquisition time is much shorter than the repetition time, and if the pulse is selective enough, it is obviously possible to perform interleaved acquisition (the equivalent of multislice imaging) of different Xe@host frequencies, by using a frequency list previously defined. In these sequences, the minimum experiment time for a given number of acquisitions will be limited by the repetition time TR. Due to the in­out exchange time of the order of 10­100 ms, it is not necessary for the magnetization to return to equilibrium as in classical MRI, and very short experiments can be used. Such a sequence is depicted in Fig. 16. This protocol has been experimentally implemented and tested on a sample composed of two immiscible solvents, each phase containing a different cryptophane at a concentration of 300 lM [177]. In 25 s it was possible to specifically image, in an interleaved way, the two cryptophanes with a high spatial resolution and a good signal-to-noise ratio, see Fig. 17. Dealing with more realistic concentrations for in vivo MRI, let us say about 5 lM, we can extrapolate from the reported images that images with a spatial resolution of about 1 Â 1 mm2 can be achieved in the same amount of time. 6.3.2. HYPERCEST approach In the CEST experiments, low-population of spin carriers in slow exchange with the bulk can be detected, as the saturated magnetization is transferred to the bulk water signal upon irradiation at the resonance frequency of the former [178]. Obviously such an approach can benefit from the use of paramagnetic chemical shift reagents, giving rise to PARACEST experiments [179]. This chemical-shift selective indirect detection scheme can result in a several

In order to avoid spurious effects of this non constant magnetization (the steadily decreasing signal will lead to an artifact along the phase direction of the image), Zhao et al. [174] have proposed to use a variable-flip-angle approach where the n th pulse should have a flip angle given by:

hn ¼ arcsin

! eðnÀ1ÞTR=T 1 sin h1 : QnÀ1 j¼1 cos hj

According to the number of points in the phase dimension and the ratio of the repetition time over longitudinal relaxation time TR/T1, the angles of all the rf pulses can be appropriately chosen. In order to optimize the use of the hyperpolarized signal, recycling of the transverse magnetization from one scan/repetition/ acquisition to the next can be performed. Such experiments are known in the literature as Steady-State Free Precession (SSFP) methods, among which true Fast Imaging and Steady Precession (trueFISP) is one of the most frequently employed for studying hyperpolarized species. The principle of the experiment is to employ fully rewound or balanced gradient moments so that moving spins are compensated at the next rf pulse, and phase-alternated excitation pulses in a fully symmetrical sequence, see Fig. 15. Its usefulness for imaging hyperpolarized species, where long longitudinal and transverse relaxation times are encountered, has been

Fig. 16. Pulse scheme for 2D fast gradient echo imaging. Because the repetition time TR is far longer than the time needed for excitation, gradient echo and detection, the sequence can be conceived in interleaved mode in which the frequency of the soft pulse is varied between acquisitions via an offset list (O1, O01 ) for a potential multiplexed detection of two biosensors. Therefore two Xe@host signals can be simultaneously monitored (dotted part of the sequence). In the centrically ordered phase encoding mode, the gradient strength evolves as: 0 (1st acquisition); +Gmin (2nd); ÀGmin; . . .; +Gmax; ÀGmax. This means that the first acquired points ­ where polarization is at its maximum value ­ code for low k values (global shape of the object).

are present for EPI). Indeed the low transverse relaxation rate of the free xenon signal and its high intensity could make possible these fast experiments, in which the number of read pulses is reduced. As this approach is based on a difference between two acquisitions, some limitations could, however, appear. It requires a constant polarization level, a criterion that will not be easily achieved in vivo where a short longitudinal relaxation time of free xenon will be encountered and where obtaining a constant steadystate magnetization is not as simple as for a flow in vitro experiment. Also image blurring or decrease of spatial selectivity may appear when fast xenon mass transport is present (such as that in a blood vessel), since the expected sensitivity improvement over the direct method is obtained through long saturation time during which xenon diffuses. 6.4. Resolution and sensitivity issues The key question deals with the capability in vitro or in vivo to conserve a very high xenon-in-solvent magnetization for the longest duration, thus allowing the largest signal averaging. The importance of this apparent decay time of the xenon magnetization has already been noticed in the two implementations used to date. Thus in the HYPERCEST approach a continuous flow of polarized xenon was used, while in the direct gradient echo imaging method the slowing down of the xenon relaxation by decreasing the cryptophane concentration allowed the recording of an image at a high resolution and at a concentration of 25 lM [177]. Other elements directly related to the mathematical principles of MRI (see for instance Ref. [181] for a review) limit the final achievable resolution in a xenon-based approach. The spatial resolution is related to the field of view (FOV) and the number of acquired points (TD). Now, the application of the maximal gradient of strength Gmax in the frequency-encoding dimension will distribute the signal (of a nucleus with gyromagnetic ratio c) arising from an object of size FOV over a frequency range cÁGÁFOV, which based on the Nyquist criterion, determines the minimal spectral width required, SWmin:

orders of magnitude increase in sensitivity over direct detection methods. Derived from this principle, the group of Pines has proposed the HYPERCEST approach, where saturation during several seconds at the caged xenon frequency precedes a read pulse on the free xenon signal [180]. Alternation of acquisitions with onresonance (at the Xe@host frequency) and off-resonance saturation enables by difference the extraction of the caged signal (thanks to the in­out exchange of the noble gas) which when combined with encoding gradients allows one to obtain a chemical shift sensitive image. An illustration of this method as well as results obtained on a two-compartment phantom containing avidin-agarose beads, is given in Fig. 18. This approach offers several advantages over the direct detection method for low biosensor concentrations. First, all xenon atoms that have been encapsulated during the saturation delay are detected. Second, because far less acquisitions are necessary, the noise is greatly reduced [172]. Finally, it renders easier the detection of the biosensor when caged xenon gives rise to a broad signal. These advantages could be amplified by combining this saturation scheme to fast imaging techniques such as FISP or EPI instead of single point detection (however, this comes at the price of an image distortion when magnetic susceptibility variations

From this equation, it is clear that in addition to the gradient strength, the important parameters are the gyromagnetic ratio of the observed nucleus and the acquisition time, limited by the transverse relaxation rate. Xenon 129 having a c value smaller than that of the proton by a factor 3.61, this induces a first spatial resolution limit, since the Gmax value is usually limited by hardware concerns. For the same gradient strength, the volume of the smallest voxel achievable will be multiplied by 47 from 1H to 129Xe. This influences the resolution inherent to the sampling of the 129Xe MRI experiment, but other parameters also have to be taken into account:  Translational diffusion. During an echo time TE, the limit of spatial resolution is given by:

 Transverse relaxation. The decay of magnetization by transverse relaxation or for gradient echoes by susceptibility variation characterized by the time T Ã makes the use of long acquisition 2 times irrelevant and in fact defines a resolution limit:

For instance considering the broadest lines ever measured for xenon in a biosensor ($220 Hz for xenon hosts immobilized on agarose beads [182,183]) and a typical gradient strength ðGzmax ¼ 1T=mÞ the limit of spatial resolution is calculated to be about 5 lm. Thus it does not seem to represent a real intrinsic resolution limit. More importantly, the xenon transverse relaxation governs the lifetime of the transverse magnetization, and can require the use of very short gradient echoes. Even if numerous questions remain dealing with the real feasibility of in vivo hyperpolarized xenon-based molecular imaging, other reported experiments allow one to be optimistic. Indeed, working with endogenous substances with DNP-hyperpolarized 13 C, the group of Golman has assessed the feasibility of in vivo subsecond imaging, and has addressed some points dealing with sensitivity. In one of the experiments [35], they injected 200 micromole [13C]urea, with a hyperpolarization of 0.1 at the moment of injection, in rats. Then they showed that is was possible to perform 13C angiography, i. e. a high resolution imaging of the vascular system, with a signal to noise ratio of 275 in less than 1 s. In another paper, they used hyperpolarized pyruvate to monitor the first

Calculation shows that this is very limiting for free gases (for instance, a typical diffusion coefficient for a gas could be close to D = 210À5 m2/s at room temperature; an echo time TE of 25 ms would lead to a resolution limit of 1 mm). In the biosensing approach, the noble gas is, however, dissolved in the blood and the self-diffusion coefficient is thus reduced to about D $ 10À9 m2/s; the apparent translational diffusion coefficient is in fact the average of that of xenon in blood and that of the host molecule, weighted by the residence times in both environments. Let us here recall the problems inherent in mass transport for xenon in blood, which will decrease the spatial selectivity of the HYPERCEST approach in vivo, see above.

minute pieces of information about its distribution, localization, and metabolism [36].

7. Biological systems 7.1. Biotin­avidin system Very few studies of biological systems based on laser-polarized xenon biosensors have been reported so far. Since the introduction of this principle, the groups of Pines and Wemmer at Berkeley have conceived and synthesized a biosensor based on cryptophanes. On a cryptophane-A core, they have grafted biotin at the end of a hydrophilic spacer designed to render the assembly water-soluble [14]. In these conditions, they could test the avidin­biotin interaction which is the one most used for in vitro assays, as the complex is characterized by one of the highest binding constant (K = 1015 MÀ1). Even if such a high value is far higher than for ligand-cellular receptors, this system appears as a useful model for exploring the different difficulties which are going to be encountered in in vivo applications of the biosensing approach and for suggesting solutions to these problems. On the 1D xenon spectra of a water solution containing this biosensor, Spence and coworkers mainly observed two resonances at a chemical shift compatible with xenon bound in cryptophane A [14]. After having postulated the presence of two compounds, one resulting from partial reaction during the chemical synthesis, they rationalized the origin of this observation [171]. Indeed as soon as the ligand possesses chiral centers, the existence of (+)and (À)-cryptophanes (according to the sense of the helicity of the linkers joining the cyclotriveratrylene units, see Fig. 8) leads to diastereotopic compounds and thus to racemic mixtures. In fact, four different diastereomers were present in solutions, with the immediate drawback of increasing the number of xenon resonances or the observed linewidth if they cannot be resolved. This problem can be avoided by resorting to optically pure cryptophanes obtained by using stereoselective chemical synthesis [184]. An even further goal of the 129Xe NMR-based biosensing approach would be to determine whether or not the biosensor is attached to the biological target. In fact, in their initial paper, Spence et al. showed that the sensitivity of the xenon chemical shift to its surrounding was sufficient to induce the observation of a chemical shift variation of about 2 ppm upon protein binding of the biosensor [171]. This shift difference has been measured for some prototypical biosensors. A set of five biosensor prototypes differing essentially in the length of the linker separating the cryptophane and the biotin sensor has been used [182]. The 129Xe spectrum for each of them was recorded at various avidin concentrations. Xenon chemical shift variations ranging between 0 ppm for the longer linker, and 4 ppm for the shorter one, were observed. The latter value, although promising, corresponds to broader caged xenon signals due to a decrease of mobility of the cryptophane cage in the surrounding of the biological target, avidin in the present case. This broadening may affect the imaging sensitivity and illustrates the need for an optimization of the linker length to obtain chemical resolution. It therefore seems that the linker should be chosen according to the environment of the targeted biological sites. A short linker, inducing a net xenon chemical shift variation that may be useful for specific imaging, would be a good choice if the biological receptor is not crowded, i.e. if the ligand recognition is not affected by the presence of the xenon host molecule and if this host moiety remains mobile. If the biological target environment is too crowded, a longer linker would be preferred, in order to keep sharp bound xenon signals, but here the ability to distinguish whether or not the biosensor is attached to the target would be lost. During the course of these studies, Lowery et al. [182] also

noticed that the xenon resonance linewidth is much larger than expected based on relaxation induced by dipolar and CSA mechanisms. Finally this biotin­avidin system was used in conditions closer to those that can be encountered in in vivo imaging (magnetic susceptibility variations) when avidin is immobilized on agarose beads [183]. Even though this reduces the overall tumbling of the biosensor leading to a significant increase of xenon transverse self-relaxation, it is still possible to image the surface receptors at low concentration, using this biosensor and a continuous flow of laser polarized xenon. 7.2. Biological systems based on enzymes Dmochowski's group in Philadelphia has also explored xenon biosensors based on cryptophanes. They have chosen to target enzymes as they perform thousands of turnovers. Thus in a relative short time it should be possible to monitor their catalytic activity through the variation of the spectral signature of the biosensors. Indeed before chemical reaction the xenon resonance corresponds to that of trapped xenon in a cryptophane bearing the specific cofactor, while after enzymatic reaction, the structure of the cofactor has changed. Such a reaction would allow a significant increase of sensitivity with respect to the direct monitoring of the stoichiometric binding to a protein. This group synthesized a matrix metalloproteinase-7 responsive 129Xe biosensor, and tested its interaction with xenon [185]. The biosensor was made of a monosubstituted cryptophane-A, bearing the consensus 7-residue peptide (Fig. 19). Since racemic cryptophanes were used, the 129Xe NMR spectrum of the sole biosensor exhibits two equally intense lines separated by 0.6 ppm. After enzymatic reaction, the NMR

spectrum at the caged xenon chemical shift reveals the presence of 4 lines, two of them being assigned to the diasteromeric products of the reaction. The global chemical shift variations were nevertheless very limited (about 0.3 ppm), inhibiting any direct chemical shift sensitive MRI application. In a subsequent work, the same group has studied another metallo-enzyme, human carbonic anhydrase II [186]. An X-ray structure of the complex composed of this enzyme and the biosensor has been reported and they mention the observation of a distinctive 129Xe chemical shift upon binding. 7.3. Other biological system The following example deals with a biosensor that has been conceived for the purpose of in vitro detection of a specific DNA fragment in solution at micromolar concentration [187]. On a methoxy group of an optically pure cryptophane-A, a tether comprising a spacer made of six CH2 groups followed by a 20-mer oligonucleotide has been grafted (Fig. 20). The 129Xe spectrum obtained at 310 K with the biosensor shows that in the presence of the complementary strand, the bound xenon signal is shifted upfield by $2 ppm, whereas it remains unchanged when in the presence of the non-complementary strand in solution. The use of an optically pure cryptophane prevented the splitting of the 129Xe NMR signals as a result of the formation of diastereomers. In this system, much weaker associations (K $ 106 MÀ1) than in the biotin­avidin complex, relying only on hydrogen bonds, are encountered. Also, this paper points out a putative problem when dealing with such biosensors at higher concentration. Fig. 21 displays the 129Xe NMR spectrum obtained with the three previous samples in the millimolar range. Whereas in the micromolar range single resonances are observed for caged xenon, at higher concentrations superimposed lines are also observed. Therefore there exists a risk of forming self-organized molecular systems (micelles, vesicles) when using such amphiphilic biosensors: the cryptophane part is hydrophobic whereas the tether contains hydrophilic groups, designed to solubilize the biosensor in water. This behavior, confirmed by concentration and salt effects on the 129Xe NMR spectra, demonstrates another strength for hyperpolarized xenon NMR i.e. its capability to discriminate between isolated host­guest complexes and large self-organized assemblies.

8. Conclusions In this article we have tried to give an overview of the developments in physics, chemistry and biochemistry for the 129Xe NMRbased biosensing approach. This concept has definite potential thanks to the huge signal enhancement rendered possible by the optical pumping step and to the very high chemical shift sensitivity allowed by 129Xe NMR. In fact, experiments in high resolution NMR spectrometers have already shown that the achievable sensitivity is compatible with the density of cell receptors, validating the idea of using the 129Xe NMR-based biosensing approach for the early detection of given pathologies or for cell tracking. Actually, the 129Xe NMR-based biosensing approach has not yet unveiled its whole capabilities for in vivo studies even though interest in laser-polarized xenon for biological applications began more than fifteen years ago. We must recognize that relatively few research groups work in this field, when compared for instance to the renewed interest for biological applications of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization. The availability of reliable commercial apparatus providing high polarization levels certainly explains the recent increased activity in DNP. The situation is nevertheless expected to favorably evolve for hyperpolarized 129 Xe NMR in the future due to the recently achieved key advances. These include:  For the production of hyperpolarized xenon, the use of frequency-narrowed laser diodes and flow-mode devices allow large amounts of highly polarized (>50%) xenon to be obtained. This increase of the product polarization times concentration per time unit combined with the installation of this type of apparatus close to MRI imagers will increase the useful polarization level by about a factor 30 and the amount of xenon magnetization available by more than two orders of magnitude.  The recent synthesis of cryptophane-111 exhibiting a huge affinity for xenon and a reduced exchange broadening of the resonance line will, as soon as chemists are able to graft on a tethered ligand, provide a further gain in sensitivity of one order of magnitude. Also the sizes of the xenon biosensors proposed so far are generally small. This exhibits several advantages. First,

the grafting of a small xenon host molecule onto a protein or a peptide serving as ligand for the vectorization of the noble gas is less likely to modify the affinity of this ligand for the biological target. Second, a small object can be a good candidate to cross the lipidic membranes and suffers less risk of toxicity associated with large objects (resulting from accumulation in the liver or kidney). As aforementioned, the development of dendrimer constructs or nanoparticles (as used for many years for paramagnetic species) is, however, providing interesting possibilities of how to increase the local density of spin carriers, and therefore the MRI contrast. But it must be kept in mind that to benefit from the increase of sensitivity allowed by the in­out exchange, a large ratio between free xenon ­ caged xenon must be locally present.  The recent developments of dedicated approaches such as HYPERCEST or trueFISP pulse sequences have already allowed a significant step forward in the use of hyperpolarized species in MRI. No doubt new pulse sequences will appear to handle the relatively fast decaying xenon magnetization and the potentially fast transverse relaxation. The challenge appears less demanding than for hyperpolarized species in the gas phase where special trajectories in the k-space have been conceived to face the fast diffusion when performing lung imaging. The transverse relaxation question does not seem to be unresolvable, as more and more MRI is opened to solids possessing proton relaxation times far shorter than that of embedded xenon. Several ways of tackling the problem can thus be envisioned by combining different recently proposed approaches. Also, ways to increase the longitudinal relaxation time of free xenon that is, as previously shown, a crucial parameter for the success of the biosensing approach, could be developed by the use of specific xenon vectors such as fluorolipids or other blood substitutes.

Finally, the specificity of the 129Xe NMR-based biosensing approach does not lie in the way the tracer gets its hyperpolarization, but rather in the nature and versatility of this tracer. As mentioned in the Introduction, working with a hyperpolarized gas such as xenon should not only allow the detection of remote biological targets but overall should open access to long time monitoring of biological events, by simple introduction of the noble gas at repeated time intervals well after introduction of the functionalized host. For us, this represents a unique potentiality and the major strength of this concept.
