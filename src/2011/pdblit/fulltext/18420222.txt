Abstract A gene, designated dnr, was identified in the vicinity of the structural genes for nitrite reductase (nirS) and nitric oxide reductase (norCB), and the gene for activation of the reductases (nirQ) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It encodes a protein of 227 amino acids homologous with the CRPIFNR-family transcriptional regulators. Promoter activities for nirS, nirQ and norCB were considerably reduced in the dnr mutant as well as in the mutant of anr, the other fnr-like regulatory gene from P. aeruginosa. This is the first finding that two CRP/FNR-related regulators are involved in denitrification in one strain.

Key words: Denitrification; Nitrite reductase; Nitric oxide reductase; F N R ; A N R ; Pseudomonas aeruginosa

1. Introduction

fnrA gene was very similar to that of the anr gene, the fnrA mutant of P. stutzeri was able to grow on nitrate under the anaerobic condition. The activity of denitrification enzymes was not affected by the fnrA mutation whereas the activity of arginine deiminase was defective. F r o m these results, Cuypers and Zumft predicted that F n r A is a specific regulator for arginine catabolism and that a second hypothetical F N R homolog, designated FnrD, controls the expression of the denitrification enzymes in P. stutzeri [13]. In this work, we found a second crp/fnr-related gene from P. aeruginosa. We propose to call the gene as dnr for dissimilatory nitrate respiration regulator. It is uncertain that dnr corresponds to the hypothetical regulatory gene, fnrD, from P. stutzeri at present, but the anaerobic growth by nitrate respiration and transcription of the nit and nor genes of P. aeruginosa completely depended on the gene.
2. Materials and methods

Bacterial denitrification is an anaerobic respiration to use nitrogenous oxides as terminal electron acceptors. F o u r enzymes, i.e. nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase, are required for complete reduction of nitrate ion to dinitrogen gas. These enzymes are induced under the low oxygen environment. Expression of the denitrification genes under the anaerobic condition is thought to be controlled by a regulatory protein similar to F N R of Eseherichia coli. F N R is a transcriptional regulator for anaerobiosis of E. coli which belongs to the same family with CRP, the regulator for catabolite gene repression [1]. There is a specific recognition sequence ( F N R box), T T G A T A T C A A , in the promoter region of the anaerobically expressed genes regulated by F N R . M a n y of the denitrification genes so far sequenced have motifs resemble to the F N R box in their promoter region [2 9]. The gene, anr, which is homologous with fnr of E. coli was found from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and shown to be necessary for anaerobic arginine catabolism and nitrate reduction [10,11]. The genes for dissimilatory nitrite reductase (nirS) and nitric oxide reductase (norCB) had A N R (FNR)-binding motifs in their promoter region [4,5] and the transcription ofnirS was defective in the anr mutant [12]. A gene homologous with fnr was also isolated from Pseudomonas stutzeri by using the anr gene from P aeruginosa as a hybridization probe and designated fnrA. Although the derived amino acid sequence of the

2.1. Bacterial strains and plasmids P aeruginosa PAO1 [14] was used as a source for the denitrification genes and to represent a wild-type trait. PAO6261, the anr mutant of P aeruginosa PAO1 was provided by D. Haas [15]. A plasmid, pHAEl, which carries a 6.5 kb EcoRI fragment containing ORF7 and a part of the dnr gene was cloned in the previous work [5]. Charomid 9-36 (Nippon gene, Toyama, Japan) was used for cloning a fragment containing the complete dnr gene. pUC119 [16] was used for subcloning, sequencing and mutagenesis of dnr. For the assay of promoter activity, the lacZ promoter probe vector pQF50 [17] was used. Escherichia coli hosts were strain DH5 for Charomid and strain JM109 for other plasraids [16]. 2.2. Media and growth conditions Bacterial strains were cultivated at 37°C in LB medium or on LB plate [16]. Cultivation for promoter assay was done in the synthetic medium described by Wood [18] supplemented with 5 mM sodium nitrite instead of 40 mM sodium nitrate. When necessary, antibiotics were added to the medium at the following concentrations (pg/ml): ampicillin (Ap) 100 and tetracycline (Tc) 12.5 for E. coli; and carbenicillin (Cb) 150 and Tc 200 for P aeruginosa. Tc was not added for the cultivation to measure the fl-galactosidase activity. For oxygen-limiting condition, a 50-ml vial (70-ml total volume) containing 20 ml of the synthetic medium was used. After inoculating 200 gl of overnight culture aerobically grown in LB medium, the vial was fitted with a butyl rubber septum and an aluminum seal. The air in the vial was replaced with argon by flushing the gas through a needle for 5 min and then oxygen gas was added into the vial to 2% (1 ml) by a gastight syringe. Cultivation was done with gentle shaking. 2.3. Transformation and mutation of P aeruginosa Introduction of DNA into P aeruginosa strains was carried out as follows: 0.2-ml overnight culture of P aeruginosa was inoculated into 20 ml of LB medium. After about 2 h cultivation with vigorous shaking, cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer (100 mM MgCI2, 10 mM Tris-HC1, pH 7.5) and stored on ice

74 for 30 min. Then cells were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer. To 100/11 of the cell suspension, appropriate amount of DNA solution was added and stored on ice for 3 h. The suspension was heated at 45°C for 2 min, cooled on ice for 2 min, and then transferred into 1 ml of medium. After incubating at 37°C for 1 h for transformation by the broad-host-range plasmids or overnight for marker exchange mutagenesis, cells were plated onto LB plates containing antibiotics and the objective clones were selected.
2.4. DNA manipulations and fS-galactosidase assay Recombinant gene techniques were carried out by standard methods [16] or that described previously [5]. The cells to measure the enzyme activity of fl-galactosidase, the gene product of lacZ, were incubated under the oxygen-limiting condition for 1618 h. After washing with Z buffer [16], the cells were resuspended in Z buffer and the fl-galactosidase activity was determined by the standard protocol [16].

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Cloning and sequencing of the downstream region of the nor genes In our previous investigation, we identified the genes for nitric oxide reductase, norCB-ORF6, nearby the nir genes for dissimilatory nitrite reduction from P. aeruginosa [5]. To determine the downstream structure of the nor genes, we cloned the region by using a 0,8-kb SphI-EcoRI fragment from pHA-E1 (Fig. 1) as a hybridization probe. A BamHI digest of chromosomal D N A from P aeruginosa PAO1 was shown to hybridize with the probe at about 8 kb in size (data not shown). BamHI fragments around 8 kb were recovered from agarose gel and ligated to Charomid 9-36. Gene library was constructed in E. coli DH5. Three positive clones out of 650 colonies were obtained by colony hybridization. Two of the three clones carried the objective fragment (pHA-B1). The nucleotide sequence of the downstream region of O R F 6 was determined (Fig. 2). Two open reading frames, O R F 7 and dnr, were identified in the opposite direction of the nor genes. O R F 7 encode a protein of 64 amino acids. Molecular weight of the O R F 7 gene product calculated from the translated sequence was 7.3 kDa. No protein with an overall similarity to the deduced sequence of O R F 7 was found in the protein data banks (SwissPlot release 30 and PIR release 43) by DDBJ FASTA e-mail server. There is a sequence resemble to the consensus binding motif of F N R (ANR) in the 5' region of ORF7, suggesting that the gene is expressed under the anaerobic conditions as a single transcriptional unit.

Calculated molecular weight of the deduced gene product is approximately 26 kDa. Homology search with the protein data banks showed that the translated sequence of dnr had an overall similarity with the CRP/FNR-family regulatory proteins. Those regulators had around 20% amino acid identity with the dnr gene product. D N R does not carry the cAMP-binding residues and the cysteine residues conserved in the C R P and F N R type proteins. A n evolutionary tree of D N R and similar regulators are designated in Fig. 3. N N R from Paracoccus denitrificans which was recently found to be encoded in the vicinity of the nir and nor genes [19] showed the highest identity (33.3%).
3.2. Construction of a dnr mutant o f P. aeruginosa The 4.5-kb J(hoI fragment containing the dnr gene from pHA-B1 was cloned into the SalI site ofpUC119. The dnr gene on the plasmid was disrupted by inserting the 1.4-kb EcoRIAvaI fragment carrying the Tc-resistance gene (tet) from pBR322 into the unique BstPI site (Fig. 1). Cohesive ends of the fragments was blunted before ligation. The constructed plasmid, pHA536, was introduced into P. aeruginosa PAO1 and a clone which shows Tc-resistant and Cb-sensitive phenotype was selected as described previously [20]. The obtained m u t a n t was designated as strain RM536. Insertion of the tet gene on the chromosome of RM536 was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis (data not shown). RM536 showed normal growth under the aerobic conditions. However, the m u t a n t could not grow under the anaerobic (denitrifying) conditions. Anaerobic growth of RM536 was completely restored by introducing the 875-bp ApaI-SphI fragment containing the dnr gene by a broad-host-range expression vector (data not shown). 3.3. Promoter activities for the nir and nor genes in the dnr and anr mutant strains In our previous investigations, we found the A N R - b i n d i n g motifs in the promoter regions of nirS and norCB [4,5]. nirQ,

which is divergently transcribed with nirS, was also suggested to be under the control of ANR [12]. Dependence of these denitrification genes on dnr or anr was examined by using lacZ as a reporter gene. The fragments containing the promoter regions for nirS, nirQ and norCB (Fig. 1) were ligated into a broad-host-range promoter probe vector, pQF50 [17] at the upstream of lacZ. The wild type (PAO1), dnr- (RM536) and anr- (PAO6261) strains were transformed by the constructed plasmids. The transformants were grown under the oxygenlimiting condition with 5 mM sodium nitrite and the activities of fl-galactosidase, the gene product of lacZ, were measured (Table 1). As a control, the activity for the tac promoter (BamHI fragment of pKK223-3 [21]) was also measured in the same way. Transcription from the tac promoter was not so affected by the dnr or anr mutation. However, the activities of the three denitrification promoters were considerably reduced by the mutation of dnr or anr. These results clearly indicated that the second crplfnr-related regulatory gene, dnr, is necessary for the expression of the nir and nor genes. It is also the first finding that anr is required for the transcription of the nitric oxide reductase gene (norCB).
3.4. Conclusions It has been reported that a regulator, ANR, is required both for denitrification and anaerobic arginine catabolism of P aeruginosa [10-12,22,23]. Recent study also confirmed that the activation of the entire denitrification pathway is under the control of ANR [15]. ANR is highly homologous with FNR of E. coli and has conserved cysteine residues which are shown to be necessary for sensing anoxia [1]. Thus, ANR is thought to be involved in the anoxic regulation of the denitrification genes. In addition to the oxygen limitation, the presence of respiratory substrates for denitrification such as nitrate and nitrite is required for the expression of denitrification enzymes [24~27]. However, the mechanism to sense these nitrogenous oxides has not been clarified. In this report, we found the second crplfnrrelated regulatory gene, dnr, from P. aeruginosa. Both of the two regulatory genes, dnr and anr, were indicated to be necessary for the expression of the nir and nor genes on the stage of transcription. DNR lacks the N-terminal cysteine cluster which may participate in sensing the intracellular redox potential. There is a possibility that DNR activate the expression of the denitrification genes by the presence of nitrogenous oxide. Recently, Van Spanning et al. found the gene similar to dnr from P denitrificans and designated nnr [19]. They showed by heine staining analyses that the gene is necessary for the expression of functional nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase enzymes. The transcription of the genes for these reductases may

be regulated by the nnr gene product. The anoxic regulator correspond to FNR from E. coli or ANR from P aeruginosa have not been identified from P denitrificans. The ANR-like regulator, FnrA, was found from P stutzeri, but FnrA was not necessary for the expression of the denitrification enzymes [13]. The CRP/FNR-related regulator which regulate the expression of the denitrification genes have not yet been found from the bacterium. The finding reported here is the first example of the involvement of two CRP/FNR-related regulators in denitrification in one strain. We are now investigating the effects of the dnr mutation on the expression of the other denitrification genes and the genes for anaerobic arginine catabolism.
