Abstract The role of secretory proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in pathogenesis and stimulation of specific host responses is well documented. They are also shown to activate different cell types, which subsequently present mycobacterial antigens to T cells. Therefore identification of T cell epitopes from this set of proteins may serve to define candidate antigens with vaccine potential. Fifty-two secretory proteins of M. tuberculosis H37Rv were analyzed computationally for the presence of HLA class I binding nonameric peptides. All possible overlapping nonameric peptide sequences from 52 secretory proteins were generated in silico and analyzed for their ability to bind to 33 alleles belonging to A, B and C loci of HLA class I. Fifteen percent of generated peptides are predicted to bind to HLA with halftime of dissociation T1/2 100 min and 73% of the peptides predicted to bind are mono-allelic in their binding. The structural basis for recognition of nonamers by different HLA molecules was studied employing structural modeling of HLA class Iepeptide complexes and there exists a good correlation between structural analysis and binding prediction. Pathogen peptides that could behave as self- or partially self-peptides in the host were eliminated using a comparative study with the human proteome, thus reducing the number of peptides for analysis. The implications of the finding for vaccine development are dis` cussed vis-a-vis the limitations of the use of subunit vaccine and DNA vaccine. Ó 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Tuberculosis is a widespread ancient disease, which causes w3 million deaths with w8 million new cases emerging each year. The only vaccine that has been used against tuberculosis is BCG, which exhibits wide variations in its efficacy as a prophylactic vaccine against adult pulmonary tuberculosis [1]. Such variations in efficacy have been attributed to several factors such as production methods, bacterial viability, dosage and method of administration, differences in vaccine and geographical location [2e7], genetic differences amongst various population groups [8,9] and interaction with environmental mycobacteria [10]. However, the distribution of HLA

polymorphism which differs widely in different populations [11] has not been taken into account. Given the global tuberculosis emergency, it is crucial to elucidate alternative strategies for developing a more promising vaccine useful across diverse populations. Among the different groups of proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that have been focused on as vaccine candidates so far, secretory proteins released into culture filtrate have been studied extensively. Their ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses and protective immunity has been shown both in mouse and guinea pig models of pulmonary tuberculosis [12]. Moreover, culture filtrate proteins of M. tuberculosis contain multiple antigens that are strongly recognized by T cells [13]. Recent evidence suggests that the secretory proteins have immunomodulatory activities, and are involved in mycobacterial subversion of the host immune defense [14]. These proteins also play an important role

in progression of pathogenesis [15,16]. Despite the fact that many secretory proteins such as ESAT-6, Ag 85A, B, C, 19 kDa lipoprotein, and CFP-10 have been shown to be responsible for protective immunity, most other secretory proteins have not been tested systematically. Evidence suggesting the role of CD8þ T cells in resistance against tuberculosis has been put forth [17] in addition to the known roles of CD4þ T cells and cytokines in limiting mycobacterial infections. Further, MHC class I restricted CD8þ T lymphocytes specific for mycobacterial antigens have been observed in mouse models of TB [18] as well as in humans [19e21] thus emphasizing the role of CD8þ T cell-mediated immune responses. Since CD8þ T cells recognize peptides presented through MHC class I [22e24] it becomes important to identify all class I binding peptides from candidate T cell antigens such that a number of HLA alleles are included to ensure the total population coverage. In theory, identification of HLA-binding peptides is the first step in the efforts to identify all T cell antigens of M. tuberculosis and to develop an effective vaccine against tuberculosis. Relatively very few CD8þ restricted epitopes have been identified against human MHC alleles in M. tuberculosis [25]. Since the genome sequence of M. tuberculosis is available [26], it is possible to identify proteins and peptides with vaccine potential from the proteome that could provide immune protection in individuals with different HLA backgrounds. In the present work, with the aim of identifying candidate antigens for vaccine design, we have carried out an in silico analysis of those proteins, which are likely to be secreted by M. tuberculosis into the extracellular environment. Fifty-two putative secretory proteins of M. tuberculosis, which have been defined as secretory based on the presence of amino terminal signal sequences [27], were chosen and a set of HLA class I binding peptides were identified. We also tested the binding of nonamers of mycobacterial proteins with reported CTL activity using the same algorithm, as a validation step. Further, molecular modeling and structural analysis were used as an additional approach to ascertain the structural feasibilities and interaction of predicted peptides with MHC. 2. Methods 2.1. Prediction of MHC class I binding peptides Sequences of 52 putative proteins that have been identified as secretory proteins, based on the presence of amino terminal signal sequence and devoid of membrane-anchoring moieties and are secreted via general export pathway [27], were obtained from Sanger center database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/ projects/M.tuberculosis). Although a comprehensive identification of secretory proteins in M. tuberculosis is not available in the literature as yet, this list is expected to form a significant portion of possible secretory proteins and therefore facilitates a first effort of systematic screening of HLA-binding peptides from secretory proteins. All possible overlapping nonamers were generated systematically from each of these sequences and were analyzed for their potential to bind to 33 different

alleles of HLA-I molecules, using a prediction algorithm from BIMAS (http://bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/hla_bind), which identifies and ranks 8-mer, 9-mer, and 10-mer peptides that contain allele specific binding motifs for HLA class I alleles measured in terms of halftime of dissociation T1/2 of b2 microglobulin [28]. This method, which is based on regression analysis and trained with experimentally derived peptide binding matrices, gives quantitative predictions in terms of halflives for the dissociation of b2 microglobulin from the MHC complex. Based on the available experimental data, this prediction algorithm estimates binding against 33 HLA class I alleles, which include 9 HLA-A alleles, 20 HLA-B alleles and 4 HLAC alleles. Since the 9aa length peptides are considered to be optimum for HLA class I binding [22e24], the algorithm was set to generate all possible overlapping nonamers. All the nonamers in each protein were scanned against each of the 33 HLA alleles available for prediction using BIMAS. The binding was estimated in terms of halftime of b2 microglobulin dissociation rate (at default cutoff, T1/2 of 100 min). Only those peptides, which were predicted to bind to any of the 33 alleles, were chosen for further analysis. Though the cutoff of 100 min was chosen arbitrarily, it is hoped that it is conservative enough to provide a set of high-affinity peptides derived from diverse proteins, and when included in the vaccine cocktail would make sure of the recognition of those antigens which are synthesized in lesser amounts by the bacteria. As a validation exercise, the prediction was tested by comparing the scores of the experimentally mapped CTL epitopes from known T cell response inducing antigens of M. tuberculosis, against specific HLA alleles using BIMAS algorithm. Another validation exercise was to either deliberately change the peptide sequences or input overlapping peptide fragment that contained only part of the good binder sequence. The algorithm correctly predicted that the modified peptide either bound very poorly or did not bind at all, thus providing good negative controls. 2.2. Identification of ``self-'' peptides Peptides predicted to bind to HLA were analyzed for homology with any of the human proteins annotated so far, using the BLAST algorithm. Each of the 9-mer peptides was checked with peptides derived from each of the 45,513 human ORFs [29,30]. In view of the short length of peptides, filtering for the low complexity regions was removed, while increasing the e-value cutoff. The BLAST results were then passed with a perl script (locally developed) to identify those peptides that exhibited (i) 100% (9aa), (ii) 90% (8aa), (iii) 70% (7aa), and (iv) less than 70% identities with the nonamer peptides derived from the human proteome. 2.3. Molecular modeling of peptideeHLA complexes The structural feasibility of replacement of the resident peptide with predicted HLA-binding peptides from M. tuberculosis was analyzed employing the three dimensional crystal structures of HLAepeptide complex as templates. Crystal structures of

740

alleles A_0201 (1BD2), B8 (1AGB), B_3501 (1A9E), and B_5101 (1E28) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank [31]. Peptides binding to the corresponding alleles were chosen from the pool of HLA-binding, non-self-peptides based on the prediction analysis described earlier. The peptides with different ranges of T1/2 (high, moderate and low) to particular alleles were chosen and modeled onto their respective structural templates so as to replace the original resident peptide in the crystal structure and the peptidee HLA complexes were subjected to energy minimizations and the interactions with test peptides were analyzed. Model building and energy minimizations were carried out using INSIGHT-II and DISCOVER modules [Accelrys Inc.]. All ° energy minimizations were carried out with a 13 A nonbonded cutoff and a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4.0, initially using the steepest algorithm followed by conjugate gradients till the root mean square [rms] derivative was less than 0.4 kcal molÿ1 lÿ1. An identical minimization with the original peptide in the crystal structure was also carried out as a control in every case. The binding of the peptides was then estimated by analyzing their interaction energies, as well as explicit analysis of the number of intra-molecular hydrogen bonds, electrostatic, van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions with the amino acid residues in the vicinity. 3. Results Fifty-two secretory proteins from the computed proteome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (3924 proteins) previously identified and validated using experimental approaches were taken as a starting data set. All overlapping nonamer peptides were generated from this data set and were screened for potential T cell antigens using the BIMAS algorithm, from which 1306 peptides were short-listed. The BIMAS algorithm has been used in a number of cases to predict T cell epitopes and in fact appears to be one of the most well accepted methods for such prediction. About 15% of the generated overlapping nonamers bind to one or more of the HLA alleles with a T1/2  100. The percentage of HLA-binding peptides generated from different individual proteins varied from 8.7 to 29%. The number of binding peptides was independent of size of the protein; i.e. the larger protein did not always yield proportionally larger number of binding peptides. 3.1. Binding profiles of the predicted peptides An analysis of the binding profiles exhibited by the secretory proteins identified various features that are important in vaccine design as described below. The profiles are studied first at the peptide level for individual epitopes, then at the protein level that reflects cumulative binding properties of the peptides and finally from an allele perspective. 3.1.1. Specificity and promiscuity in peptideeHLA binding Most of the peptides were found to exhibit mono-allele specificity, meaning that they bind to a single allele. Some of them, however, appeared to bind to multiple alleles; the

highest number of alleles a given nonamer could bind being 4 out of the 33 alleles tested. This observation was not restricted to one locus but was the same in all the 3 loci: A, B and C, thus providing a clear idea of the specificity and promiscuity exhibited by individual peptides. In fact, out of the 1306 HLA-binding nonamers, 3 peptides bind to 4 alleles, 128 bind to 3 alleles, and 219 bind to 2 alleles. Nine hundred fifty-six peptides show mono-allelic binding. The number of binding peptides and the number of alleles they bind from each of 52 proteins are summarized in Table 1. 3.1.2. Identification of proteins with peptides binding to larger number of alleles Identifying proteins with many epitopes that can bind to many HLA class I molecules is important, considering the polymorphic nature of HLA and its diversity in populations of different geographical regions. Therefore, a good T cell antigen should have peptides recognized by many HLA alleles. The analysis revealed that 4 proteins (Rv3096, Rv1006, Rv3170, and Rv1488), leading to 342 potential binding peptides, rank highest in this classification, since they bind individually to 15e16 alleles each. The highest number of binding peptides (104 peptides, which is 23.6% of generated peptides) is derived from the protein Rv3170 (Probable Monoamine Oxidase) which binds to a maximum of 16 alleles. 3.1.3. Few alleles bind large number of peptides than others For short-listing potential vaccine candidates, it is important to analyze the binding profiles from an allele perspective. Of the 33 alleles studied, the largest number of nonamers (432, which is 33% of binding peptides) was found to be recognized by the allele B_2705 followed by B_5101 (425), B_5102 (297), B_5103 (157), Cw_0401 (103), A68.1 (88), A_0201 (55), B_2702 (46), A24 (37) and B7 (31), as illustrated in the histogram (Fig. 1). It is worth noting that several alleles such as A_1101, A_3101, A_3302, B_3902, Cw_0602, Cw_0702 at the chosen cutoff for T1/2  100, did not bind any peptides. These alleles may not have high affinity for peptides. It is important to study the prevalence of these alleles in different populations and to consider variations in immune response during vaccine design. Systematic studies such as this can also facilitate analysis of correlation of vaccine failures with frequencies of these alleles. 3.1.4. Allelic variation in binding affinity The T1/2 with which a peptide binds to HLA ranges from 100 to 20,000 min. One hundred twenty peptides from the selected secretory proteins are high-affinity binders, which bind with a T1/2 of 500. In general, the binding affinity of peptides to B locus alleles (especially B_2705 and B_5101) is higher compared to alleles of A and C loci. 3.2. Self- or partially self-peptides among binding nonamers The binding peptides from all 52 proteins were analyzed for similarities with each of 45,513 proteins of the human

proteome and the peptides were categorized into 3 classes: (i) those with complete similarity/identity with human peptides (self-peptides), (ii) those with 8, 7, 6 or 5 amino acid similarity (partially self) and (iii) those without any significant similarity (non-self-peptides). It is important to identify partially selfpeptides, since they could mount an autoimmune response in the host upon immunization. Of the binding nonamers, only one peptide VALDVARIL of ferredoxin reductase in

M. tuberculosis was found to be a complete self-peptide which shares homology with a peptide from ferredoxin reductase isoform 2 precursor in humans. Apart from this, there are several partial self-peptides with 8 or 7 amino acid identities with proteins of the human proteome (Table 2). It is observed that, of the 1306 HLA-binding peptides, 27 peptides have similarity in 8 out of 9 amino acid positions, 32 peptides have similarity in 7 out of 9 positions. About 479 peptides have similarities in 6

Fig. 1. Observed variation in the binding of predicted peptides to the 33 different HLA class I alleles studied. The figure depicts the proportion of binding peptides to individual alleles. Alleles from B locus are shown to bind to large numbers of peptides with high affinity compared with A and C loci. HLA B_2705 shows the highest number of peptides binding with high affinity i.e. around 432 peptides. Some alleles like A_1101, A_3101, A_3302, B_3902, Cw_0602, and Cw_0702 do not bind any peptides.

out of 9 positions and about 634 peptides had similarities in 5 out of 9 amino acid positions, which also have the potential to act as partial self-peptides. Complete self- and partially selfnonamers were eliminated from further analysis. Only 67 peptides were found to be completely non-self out of which 15 (22%) peptides are generated from proteins coded by genes Rv3036c, Rv0477 and Rv1488. These proteins could be taken up for further study to develop recombinant DNA/Poly epitope vaccine which includes only non-self-peptides. 3.3. Molecular modeling of peptideeHLA complexes The feasibility of binding of peptides to their respective class I alleles was investigated by molecular modeling and structural analysis. Sample peptides for both high-affinity binders and low-affinity binders for each allele (6 for A_0201, 3 for B8, 3 for B_5101, and 8 for B_3501) were modeled onto their respective structural templates (1BD2, 1AGB, 1E28, and 1A9E). The binding sites of the peptides on the HLA molecule can be described as a set of 4 pockets p1ep4 where the second residue of a 9-mer peptide binds to pocket p1, the third to pocket p2, either the fifth or sixth to pocket p3, and the ninth residue to p4, also participated by position 8 in some alleles. Positions 1, 4, 5 or 6, 7 and sometimes 8 primarily bind to the TCR and do not contribute significantly to baseline HLA binding. However, additional interactions with HLA are observed for some peptides which help in modulating the increase or decrease in affinity towards the peptide. For HLA A_0201, the peptide YMLDMTFPV (Rv3036c) docked

onto 1AO7 (A_0201 allele) had a very high-binding constant with a T1/2 of 20,331 (Fig. 2), an increase of 10-fold over the crystallized resident peptide. Analysis of the structure revealed that the predicted peptide as compared to the crystallized peptide would have extra hydrogen bonds formed by tyrosine at position 1 with lysine 66 of the A subunit of HLA A_0201 as well as a good stacking interaction with tryptophan 167 of the same subunit. In addition, another hydrogen bond was found to be feasible by the side chain of threonine at position 6 with the side chain of histidine 70 of the a subunit of HLA A_0201. The other high-binding peptides predicted too could be accommodated in the pockets p1, p2, p3, and p4 of the HLA molecule. Hydrophobic interaction made by residues at position 2 (with HLA residues methionine 45 and valine 67) appears to be a prerequisite for binding to pocket p1 of A subunit of this allele. The fact that all the peptides predicted to have good binding affinities have a leucine or methionine at this position implies that the matrices derived from experimental data encode the structural information inherently. Similarly, models of various binding peptides predicted to bind to B8, B_5101 and B_3501 alleles were built and analyzed. Clear explanations for the 10-fold increase in the affinity were found for the peptide VLRSRKSTL (Rv1006c), with respect to the crystallized peptide GGRKKYKL in the B8 allele. Residues at positions 1, 2, 5 and 9 also showed extra interactions with the HLA molecule. Comparison with the octameric crystallized peptide reveals that the change in the length of the peptide to include the ninth residue contributes significantly to an increase in the binding affinity.

predicted to bind to B_3501 did not appear to have any significant structural advantage, except for a preference of a hydrophobic residue at p9. However, the predicted peptide could be accommodated without any difficulty. Similarly there was a preference for isoleucine at the ninth position for peptides binding to this allele. The modeled structure of HLA with high-affinity peptides shows more interactions in terms of hydrogen bonds when compared to peptides with low affinity. This finding correlates well with the higher binding affinities of the predicted peptides. The feasibility of peptide binding for a given allele is also indicated by the intermolecular energies between the peptides and the alleles. A comparison of intermolecular energies and T1/2 values is given in Table 3. It can be seen that the peptides with high affinity as judged by the T1/2 values also show high (more negative) interaction energies, for most of the peptides, thus falling into a qualitative pattern. Such correlations were not seen in all the cases however, especially where the T1/2 was less than 50. It must be mentioned that seeking quantitative correlations between the matrices would be inappropriate, given that they both measure different parameters employing different methods, although ultimately both reflect the ability to bind. Therefore, we feel that the correlations, to a large extent, but not totally, are not unnatural for an acceptable prediction.

Correlation with known CTL epitopes The proteins that were established to be highly immunogenic and whose epitopes have been experimentally defined and mapped against human MHC [32] were analyzed with the BIMAS algorithm (for 18 peptides derived from 9 proteins). We observed that, the experimentally known peptides were in all cases included as part of the different nonamers that were predicted to bind to the alleles. In 11 cases, they also bound with a very high affinity, beyond the high threshold chosen in the study. This exercise served as a good positive control increasing the confidence level, with which a prediction can be viewed. The peptides chosen and their T1/2 values are shown in Table 4. It is expected that allele specific binding of the peptides, which elicit CTL responses, would provide validation to the hypothesis that the bioinformatics method can be generally used as a first step towards screening of peptides with vaccine potential. The results obtained showed that about 70% of the peptides tested showed good binding T1/2  100 while the rest showed binding with relatively lower affinity. These results assume significance when one compares them to the 15% of all peptides from M. tuberculosis secretory proteins binding to HLA. The exceptions to this general observation are the peptides derived from ESAT-6. These peptides

have been shown to produce good CTL response and even the HLA to which they are restricted have been mapped [33]. However, these peptides showed very low affinity when tested using the BIMAS algorithm as seen from the T1/2 values (Table 4). These anomalous results may be due to one or more of the following scenarios: (a) high concentrations of these peptides are used to generate CTL response, (b) the in vivo stability of the peptides may be different and (c) the peptideeHLA complex generated may still have very high affinity to TCR on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Our results do not prove or disprove these assumptions except making the general observation that some of the potentially good CTL response generating peptides might be missed if one uses this method solely to identify peptides with good vaccine potential. 4. Discussion Mycobacterial secretory proteins are highly immunogenic [32e35] and are potential vaccine candidates. Efficient processing and presentation of vaccine antigens by class I and/or class II MHC are essential for a good T cell response. Since humans carry only a limited number of co-dominant HLA alleles in their genome (2 each for A, B and C loci), out of hundreds of polymorphic alleles present in the population, it becomes important that a candidate vaccine must generate peptides that bind to a wide range of HLA molecules to provide good population coverage. To address this problem of selection of appropriate proteins as vaccine candidates, we have analyzed selected secretory proteins of M. tuberculosis to identify putative HLA class I binding peptides. A T1/2 of 100 min was chosen as a cutoff point in order to select the relatively high-affinity binding peptides. It is possible that some good T cell epitopes may be missed out in this analysis, which bind with HLA with relatively less affinity and may still bind TCR with high affinity, since the TCReHLAe peptide complex stability/affinity is also crucial in determining the T cell response. The surprise finding in this work is that peptides bind in larger numbers and at higher affinity to alleles of B locus

than of A and C loci. This suggests that greater emphasis be placed on CTL response generated by presentation of antigen by B locus alleles and design epitope-based vaccine directed towards this HLA. However, most studies carried out so far on allele specific CTL responses have used alleles of A locus, specifically A2 [28,36]. The second finding is that most peptides are mono-allelic binders (w85%) i.e. they bind to a single allele. This finding has very significant implications. The development of new generation vaccines has focused on using individual proteins [34] or DNA coding for a single protein or a small set of proteins [37]. Though these attempts are successful experimentally in individual cases, it will not be applicable to a whole population, due to allele polymorphism. Thus the use of the attenuated organism or a cocktail of proteins/genes in subunit/ DNA vaccines is likely to cover the entire population. The peptides binding to more than one HLA are termed promiscuous and such peptides are of prime interest for vaccine design because of their relevance in coverage of higher proportions of human populations. In silico approaches would help to predict some of the HLA-binding motifs, which could act as promiscuous epitopes. The restricted binding of nonamers to different HLA molecules also suggests that animal experiments to determine CTL response may not be equated to the human CTL response. It is quite doubtful if the peptide that binds to class I of mouse MHC would bind to class I HLA. Among the HLA-binding peptides, a large number of peptides show similarity to self-peptides. It is quite possible that they may not be able to generate CTL responses, as the lymphocytes which could recognize them would be absent. The worst scenario would be if these peptides generate an autoimmune reaction in the vaccinated individual. Therefore only peptides with high HLA-binding potential and which do not share homology with self-peptides should be chosen for epitope-based vaccine approaches. Employing MHCepeptide complex crystal structures, the ability of peptides identified as strong binders to replace the resident peptide in crystal structure was assessed to provide additional evidence for the

choice of peptides. Thus, in the present work, modeling has been done to validate the peptides identified by in silico prediction. A similar approach was employed for identifying putative T cell epitopes from PE and PPE groups of proteins [38]. Examining each antigen experimentally for its potential as a vaccine candidate is an expensive and tedious process. Therefore an initial computational filtration of probable candidate antigens would be cost and time effective. Since CTL responses play a key role in limiting mycobacterial infection, identification of antigens having CD8þ T cell epitopes assumes importance. MHCepeptide binding algorithms have been extensively used to select peptides with such epitopes for possible use as vaccine candidates [39e41]. We are aware that our results are based on BIMAS algorithms and therefore

depend on the power of the algorithm used, particularly pertaining to the determination of HLA-binding affinity. From the analysis of known CTL epitopes for HLA binding using the same algorithm, it was observed that only 50% (9 peptides) bind to HLA with relatively higher affinity, 50% bind with relatively low affinity or did not bind to HLA, but have been shown to generate good CTL responses. However, mycobacterial proteins are known to generate CTL responses through nonclassical antigen presentation [42]. For example, the 19-kDa protein that generates good CTL response is a lipoprotein and lipoproteins are known to be presented through CD-1 molecules [43]. In the present work, employing an immuno-informatics approach and molecular modeling, a set of peptides has been identified which could be used in either a natural or synthetic vaccine cocktail. This approach could be extended to the entire proteome of M. tuberculosis to identify newer sets of potentially antigenic proteins and yet reducing the number of T cell antigens for experimental verification. In summary, the conclusions drawn for mycobacterial proteins are expected to be generally true for all pathogens. The availability of the genome sequence of several pathogens has opened up opportunities to design rational vaccines, which may be haplotype specific or population specific. It is tempting to suggest that due to the binding of peptides to a very limited number of MHC alleles, subunit or DNA vaccines will have greater chances of success if they are targeted toward non-classical antigen presentation where MHC restriction is not involved.
