ABSTRACT: Human upstream binding factor (hUBF) is a nucleolar transcription factor involved in transcription by RNA polymerase I. It contains six HMG box domains. The contribution of each HMG box motif to its function is different. hUBF HMG box 1 shows a very strong binding affinity for both the four-way DNA junction and a 15 bp GC-rich rRNA gene core promoter fragment, but hUBF HMG box 5 shows a much weaker binding affinity for the four-way DNA junction and the GC-rich rRNA gene core promoter fragment. To illustrate the molecular basis of their DNA binding difference, the solution structure of box 5 was studied by NMR. The tertiary structure of box 5 shows a common flattened L-shaped fold, similar to box 1 and other HMG boxes with known structures. It is formed by intersection of three helical arms: helix 1 (residues 9-25) and helix 2 (residues 30-42) pack into each other to form the major wing, while helix 3 (residues 48-70) is aligned with the extended N-terminal segment to form the minor wing. A hydrophobic core is formed by three tryptophans (W14, W41, and W52) to maintain the fold. Although there is similarity between the two structures, negative charged electrostatic surface potential in the concave face of the molecule of box 5 exhibits great difference compared to that of box 1 and other HMG boxes with known structures. That surface is involved in DNA binding. Besides, in positions which are involved in intercalating into a DNA base pair, there are hydrophobic residues in box 1 and other HMG boxes but polar residues in box 5. These differences may contribute to the loss of the DNA binding ability of box 5.

Transcription of the tandemly repeated genes in human encoding ribosomal RNAs involves protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions between the rRNA gene promoter, human RNA polymerase, and at least two transcription factors, hUBF1 and hSL1 (1). The human RNA polymerase transcription factor SL1 (hSL1) is composed of TBP and three TAFs (2). hSL1 could not bind efficiently to the rRNA gene core promoter, and its efficient binding requires hUBF. Conversely, binding of hUBF is also enhanced by hSL1, indicating cooperative binding to the rRNA gene between the two factors (3).

Human upstream binding factor (hUBF) is made up of a doublet of 97 and 94 kDa, termed hUBF1 and hUBF2, respectively, which is originated by alternative splicing (4). Sequence analysis revealed that hUBF1 contains six tandemly repeated DNA binding domain HMG boxes (1, 15). There is a deletion of 37 amino acid residues within the second of six HMG boxes in hUBF2 (1, 5). The contribution of each HMG box motif to the function in DNA binding and transcription activity is different. HMG box 1 is necessary and sufficient for specific DNA binding, and other HMG domains and the C-terminal acidic tail contribute to transcription activity (6, 7). The HMG box domain is a relatively small DNA binding motif, usually 70-80 amino acid residues, which was first recognized by sequence alignment of hUBF with a highmobility group protein. This kind of DNA binding motif has been found in many proteins (8-11), including nuclear and mitochondrial transcription factors and DNA repair proteins. HMG box proteins could be divided into two subtypes according to their DNA binding specificity. The first subtype contains only one HMG box and could bind to an AT-rich DNA sequence. Examples include the mammalian testisdetermining factor SRY (12), the lymphoid-specific enhancer binding factor LEF1 (13), and the T-cell factor TCF1 (14). A second class of HMG box proteins that bind to DNA in no obvious sequence-specific recognition is exemplified by

Solution Structure and DNA Binding Property of hUBF HMG Box 5 high-mobility group proteins 1 and 2 (HMG1 and HMG2, respectively) and the human mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) (16). Many proteins of both subtypes have been shown to bind with a high binding affinity to the fourway DNA junction that mimics the Holliday structure, a putative intermediate in DNA recombination (17). hUBF binds to the ribosomal promoter with only a relaxed specificity (1, 6); no discernible recognition site could be defined. It may represent another subclass of HMG box proteins lying between two subclasses mentioned above. This was supported by a homology study of 121 HMG boxes, which classified three (namely, HMG boxes 1, 3, and 6) of the six HMG boxes in hUBF into a middle subgroup (10). As the first step in RNA pol I transcription, hUBF must bind to the ribosomal promoter specifically; how this specificity is encoded in either the promoter or the multiple DNA binding domains of hUBF remains unclear. Another interesting feature of hUBF is that it binds to GC-rich sequences (1), whereas other HMG box proteins usually prefer ATrich sequences, which may have greater bendability to adopt bending induced by HMG box binding. We have previously reported the tertiary structure of hUBF HMG box 1 (18), which just shows a conserved structure like other HMG box proteins, including both the nonsequence-specific subtype and the sequence-specific subtype (19-29). All these HMG box domains show a common flattened L-shaped fold formed by the intersection of three helical arms. We also confirmed that HMG box 1 has a very strong binding affinity for the four-way DNA junction (dissociation constant KD of 3.0 × 10-8 M) and a 15 bp GCrich DNA fragment within the rRNA gene core promoter (dissociation constant KD of 2.6 × 10-7 M) (30). It is believed that its structure and DNA binding properties are relevant for the role of HMG box 1 in the interaction of hUBF with the rRNA gene promoter. Each HMG box has been thought to have a discreet function in hUBF, whether the structure and DNA binding property of other HMG box domains in hUBF are similar to or different from those of the first HMG box. The relationships between their structures and function are still intriguing. In this paper, another HMG box in hUBF, HMG box 5, was studied. It exhibits a DNA binding property very different from that of HMG box 1. The question of what cause this difference between them arises. Furthermore, we resolved its tertiary structure by NMR. hUBF box 5 shows a conserved tertiary structure like other HMG box domains, though containing a shorter loop between helix 1 and helix 2. The sequences of some other HMG boxes were compared with that of hUBF box 5. The residues at positions X, Y, and Z (Figure 5a), which are responsible for DNA bending and binding, are different from the residues in hUBF box 5. Also, hUBF box 5 exhibits an electrostatic surface potential different from those of all HMG box proteins with known structures. This work provides further insight into the DNA binding and bending properties of this DNA binding domain, which helps us understand the role of HMG box 5 in hUBF and the evolutionary adaptation of this sort of DNA binding domain.

The identity of the subcloned HMG box 5 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The recombinant vector was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) for expression. Expression and Purification. A high-level expression clone was selected. For the production of unlabeled protein, the transformed cells were grown in LB medium, while for preparation of 13C- and 15N-labeled proteins, cultures were grown on SV40 medium containing 2.5 g/L [13C6]glucose and 0.5 g/L 15NH4Cl as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. After the OD600 reached 0.6-0.8, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. The culture was incubated for an additional 4 h. Then the cells were collected by centrifugation. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 40 mL of binding buffer [20 mM TrisHCl, 0.5 M NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.6)]. The cells were broken on ice by ultrasonication and centrifuged to remove the debris. The supernatant was applied to a 5 mL Hitrap chelating column (Pharmacia), to which had been previously applied 5 mL of 0.1 M NiSO4, and equilibrated with 5 bed columns of binding buffer. After application of the sample, the column was first washed with binding buffer for 5 bed columns. Washing buffer [containing 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.6), 0.5 M NaCl, and 100 mM imidazole] was used to wash impurities for an additional 5 bed columns. At last, the bound recombinant protein was eluted with elution buffer [containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 M imidazole]. The purity of the fractions was analyzed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE (10%, w/v) (31). They proved to be more than 95% pure. The concentration of the pure recombinant protein was analyzed with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The yield was 20 mg/L. Gel Mobility Shift Assay. The four-way DNA junction binding experiment was performed according to the method of Tetsuji Ohno et al. (32). The four strands, each 35 nucleotides in length, were designed in this experiment: 5GCCTTCAACCACCGCTCAACTCAACTGCAGTCTGG3, 5-GCCAGACTGCAGTTGAGTCCTTGCTAGGACGGAGG-3, 5-GCCTCCGTCCTAGCAAGGGGCTGCTACCGGAAGGG-3, 5-GCCCTTCCGGTAGCAGCCTGAGCGGTGGTTGAAGG-3. By annealing the appropriate nucleotides and purifying by electrophoresis, we obtained the JCT3 four-way DNA junction molecules. It was labeled with [-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase. A sample of purified HMG box 5 protein was incubated with a radioactively 5-32P-labeled four-way DNA junction (25 nM) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 50 ng/µL poly(dI-dC) (binding buffer) at various concentrations (0300 nM) in a total volume of 10 µL for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, 1 µL of 10× gel loading buffer [250 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2% bromophenol blue, and 40% glycerol] was added only to the mixture for the negative control reaction. The DNA was separated on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (pH 8.3) consisting of 89 mM Tris base, 89 mM boric acid, and 2 mM EDTA. After electrophoresis, the gel was scanned with a typhoon system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

1932 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 7, 2003 Surface Plasmon Resonance Assay. The interaction of the recombinant protein with the junction was further studied by using a BIACORE-1000 instrument. The binding and dissociation reactions were performed in the same buffer for the gel mobility shift assay. To investigate the interaction of the recombinant hUBF HMG box 5 with the rRNA gene core promoter, a short fragment CP was selected (30). The reaction was performed in the same buffer for the gel mobility shift assay. The flow rate was 5 µL/min. NMR Sample Preparation and NMR Spectroscopy. The purified doubly labeled protein was dissolved to a final concentration of 3 mM in 45 mM potassium phosphate (pH 5.5, containing 10% D2O) at 300 K. All NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DMX500 spectrometer with a self-shielded z-axis gradient. The following spectra were recorded at 300 K to obtain backbone and side chain resonance assignments: 2D 1H,15NHSQC, 2D 1H,13C-HSQC, 2D TOCSY, 3D triple-resonance spectra HNCO, CBCA(CO)NH, CBCANH, C(CO)NHTOCSY, H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, HCCH-TOCSY, HBHA(CO)NH, 2D CB(CC)HD-COSY (aromatics), and 3D 13Cseparated and 15N-separated NOESY (mixing time of 130 ms). The doubly labeled sample was finally lyophilized and dissolved in 99.96% D2O, which was followed immediately with HSQC experiments in an effort to monitor the disappearance of NH signals at 290 K. After all the peaks had vanished, 2D homonuclear TOCSY and NOESY spectra were recorded at 300 K, which exhibited proton resonance from aromatic rings exclusively in the region beyond 6.0 ppm. The {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE was measured using 15N-labeled protein in an H2O buffer at 300 K. NMR data processing was carried out using NMRPipe and NMRDraw software, and the data were analyzed with PIPP. All software was run on a Linux system. Linear prediction (33) was used to improve spectral resolution in the indirect dimensions where constant-time acquisition was used, for example, the 15N evolution dimension in all the tripleresonance experiments mentioned above. Experimental Restraints and NMR Structure Calculation. Three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY-HSQC and 13Cseparated NOESY-HSQC and 2D NOESY spectra in D2O were acquired to delineate the interproton distance restraints. The intensities of the cross-peaks in spectrum were classified as strong, medium, weak, and very weak, corresponding to distance restraints of 1.8-3.0, 1.8-4.0, 1.8-5.0, and 1.87.0 Å, respectively. More conservative distance estimation was used for the latter two NOESY spectra, considering that the spin diffusion effect could be serious for aliphatic and aromatic protons. The chemical shift index (CSI) (34) was calculated for four types of nuclei: CR, C , C, and HR. The derived secondary structures based on the consensus CSI were converted into restraints on  and  angles. For R-helix residues,  angles were limited to -60 ( 40°, while  was in the range of -50 ( 50°. From the identified slow exchange amide protons located in regular secondary structures, hydrogen bond restraints were added. Structures were calculated using the program CNS version 1.0, employing a simulated annealing protocol for torsion angle dynamics (35). Simple impulsion nonbonded interactions were used during structure calculation. Structural figures were produced with MOLMOL and Rasmol 2.6.4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Binding of hUBF HMG Box 5 to DNA

Yang et al.

A gel mobility shift assay and SPR have been carried out in an effort to analyze binding of hUBF HMG box 5 to a four-way DNA junction (Figure 1a,b). From the gel mobility shift assay, we found that box 5 has a behavior in its binding to the four-way DNA junction different from that of box 1. Under the same conditions for both experiments, a set of four shifted bands could be seen in the interaction between box 1 and the four-way DNA junction (30). However, there are no multiple-shift bands appearing in this experiment for box 5. Only a tiny retarded band could be seen with increasing protein concentrations. The binding affinity was measured by SPR. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of hUBF box 1 for the four-way junction is 3.0 × 10-8 M (30), and the binding of hUBF HMG box 5 to the four-way junction is too weak to be measured. Another SPR experiment was carried out to study the binding of the hUBF HMG box 5 to a 15 bp GC-rich DNA fragment within the rRNA gene core promoter. This fragment has been studied by SPR in our work (30), which shows a rather strong binding affinity for box 1. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) is 2.6 × 10-7 M. In contrast to box 1, box 5 almost shows no affinity for this DNA fragment (Figure 1c). This difference implies that these two domains play different roles in the activity of human upstream binding factor functioning in the transcription of the rRNA gene. NMR Measurement Chemical Shift Assignments. The 2D 1H,15N-HSQC spectrum illustrates the good dispersion of the proton and nitrogen resonances in the amide groups. Complete backbone assignments of residues G1-E84 were made for 1HN, 15N, 1HR, 1 H , 13CR, and 13C (in fact, the recombinant protein contains residues 478-560 of hUBF, and an N-terminal Met and a C-terminal hexahistidine-LEHHHHHH motif, which were not well assigned). Most 13CO assignments were determined, except for those of residues preceding prolines. Assignments of side chain resonances were mostly completed, and were checked with C(CO)NH-TOCSY, H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, and HCCH-TOCSY experiments. Some aromatic ring proton chemical shifts were assigned by 2D TOCSY in D2O, 1H,13CHSQC, and CB(CC)HD-COSY experiments, and the others were assigned through NOEs between ring protons and the intraresidue H and HN atoms. In all, more than 90% of the side chain resonances were assigned. All the resonance assignments are listed in the Supporting Information. Secondary Structure Determination. The secondary structure prediction is based on the chemical shift index (CSI) and the characteristic sequential and medium-range NOE links (Figure 2). According to the CSI, there are three helical regions located at residues 10-25, 30-42, and 45-70. The first helical region (residues 10-25) is separated at residues V18 and I19 from the CSI prediction. A similar secondary structure was made from characteristic sequential and medium-range NOE links. But there are some subtle differences. The beginning of first helix seemingly extends to R9, while the end of the third helix maybe extends to A72, until it is interrupted by P73. The second helix seems to extend to M44. In the sequence of residues F26-D29, just after

FIGURE 2: Summary of sequential and medium-range NOE contacts observed in HMG box 5 of hUBF. The data are derived from 15Nseparated NOESY and 13C-separated NOESY spectra; the mixing time is 130 ms for both. The three rows of solid bars below the sequence represent the observed sequential dNN, dRN, and d N NOE contacts; the thickness of the bars indicates the intensities of the corresponding cross-peaks in NOESY. Lines below the sequential contacts represent the dRN(i,i+3), dRN(i,i+4), dRN(i,i+2), dNN(i,i+2), and dR (i,i+3) NOE contacts. Filled circles denote the locations of slowly exchanging amide protons. The short bars at the bottom represent consensus CSI predictions from CR, C , C, and HR chemical shifts; bars below the line mean an index of -1, while those above the line mean an index +1.

helix 1, a strong dNN(2,3) contact was found, which to some extent means a turn. Unfortunately, because there is heavy overlap in the NOESY spectrum in the region of D29, we could not observe a dRN(2,4) contact in this sequence. The

rate of exchange of amide protons with solvents was measured. Amide protons still present after 20 h of exchange were considered slowly exchanging amide protons, which may be engaged in hydrogen bonds. Nineteen slow exchange

Yang et al. 3c). We suppose that the level of disorder in these residues, to some extent, is correlated with the flexibility of the peptide rather than due to a lack of NOEs. Structure Description. Figure 4b shows a schematic ribbon model of the minimized average structure of hUBF HMG box 5. As expected from the secondary structure analysis, the three helices are located at residues 9-26, 30-42, and 48-70. It forms an L shape with helices 1 and 2 in one arm (the major wing) and helix 3 and the N-terminal residues in the other arm (the minor wing). The global structure is similar to that found for other HMG boxes. There are two loop domains connecting helix 1 and helix 2 and connecting helix 2 and helix 3. In loop 2, residues 43 and 44 are in a partially helical conformation and the following three residues (4547) are in a type I turn conformation. The angle between helix 2 and helix 3 is 80°, while helix 1 intersects with helix 2 and helix 3 with angles of 35° and 75°, respectively. There is a bend of 38° in the middle of helix 1 (residues 18 and 19). The conserved aromatic rings of W14, W41, and W52 stack into each other, forming a hydrophobic core to stabilize the structure of the protein (Figure 4b). This core is extended into both arms and angle apexes. The packing of helix 1 into helix 2 also involves V18, I19, Y22, L34, and M37. Residue L23 make close contact with residues N28/R30 to stabilize the loop between helix 1 and helix 2. The loop between helix 2 and helix 3 is stabilized by W41/ M44 and K49. The orientation of helix 1 and helix 3 depends on the contact between R9/A10 and I53, in addition to the contact between I13 and K55/A56. In the minor wing, the N-terminal segment alongside helix 1 is fixed by packing of Y63, E66, and L67 to P4 and P7. In addition, a salt bridge possibly forms between K8 and D59. This contact stabilized the minor wing. Comparison with hUBF HMG Box 1 and Other HMG Box Proteins. The backbone rms deviations between the minimized average structure of hUBF box 5 and some other HMG boxes are listed in Table 1d. In contrast with hUBF box 1, hUBF box 5 has a greater deviation from other HMG boxes (18). The structure most similar to hUBF box 5 is hUBF box 1, which reflects some relations between these two domains in hUBF. Like box 1, there is an angle (only 35°) between helices 1 and 2 in hUBF box 5 somewhat smaller than that in other HMG box folds (18, 28). The angle between helices 2 and 3 and bend angle of helix 1 in hUBF box 5 are almost the same as those in hUBF box 1, while the angle between helices 1 and 3 in hUBF box 5 is larger than that in box 1. They are 75° and 60°, respectively. However, this interhelical angle difference may be due to the precise nature of the NOE constraints used in the structural determination, rather than a real difference. To ensure that the structure determined for box 5 better fits the experimental NOE constraints used in structure determination than that for box 1, we have used a box 1 backbone structure as the starting structure (processed with MODELLER 4), and refined it with the restraints used for box 5. This still results in a structure that is the same as the structure that would be generated using random structure as the starting structure. The backbone rms deviation (from residue 9 to residue 70) between the minimized average structures resulting from these two approaches is 0.34, and the interhelical angles do not change. The most distinctive change in structural feature shown by hUBF box 5 lies on loop 1 (Figure 5b). Loop 1 in hUBF

amide protons were identified, which were all in the predicted helical region (Figure 2). Structure Calculations. The tertiary structure was determined from a total of 1098 restraints, including 156 intraresidue, 327 sequential, 402 medium-range, and 213 long-range, together with 104 backbone dihedral angle constraints and 18 hydrogen bond constraints (Table 1). Being unassigned, the first residue Met and the C-terminal hexahistidine tag had no NMR restraints, and they were excluded from structure calculation. From 100 calculated structures, the 30 structures with the lowest total energy were selected. All these conformations are in good agreement with the experimental data, with no distance violations larger than 0.5 Å and no angle violations of more than 5°. The Procheck program was used to check the stereochemical quality of the structures. It showed that 97.1% of the residues are in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The structure was well-defined between residues 8 and 64, with an atomic root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) from the average structure of 0.46 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.09 Å for all heavy atoms. Outside of this region, from residue P7 to the N-terminus and from residue R65 to the C-terminus, there is a gradually increasing level of disorder (Figure 3a). According to the {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE analysis (Figure 3b), the {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE values have a tendency toward negative values in both termini. In the region from residue P4 to P7 and from residue R65 to E69, a number of NOEs could still be found (Figure

box 5 is shorter than that in hUBF box 1 and other HMG boxes, which makes a close contact between the C-terminal segment of helix 1 and the N-terminal segment of helix 2. This interaction has an effect on the whole structure, making it more elongated than other DNA binding HMG boxes. Molecular Basis for Its DNA Binding Properties. All HMG boxes with known structures have a similar L-shaped structure. What causes hUBF HMG box 5 to bind to DNA in a manner so different from that of hUBF HMG box 1? According to the previously determined HMG box-DNA complexes, as exemplified by both the sequence-specific and non-sequence-specific HMG boxes (24-27), the DNA binding concave face conforms to a wide, shallow minor groove. Numerous electrostatic interaction and van der Waals contact make up the interface. In the center of the concave face, a hydrophobic wedge inserts deeply into the minor groove of the DNA duplex. This interaction introduces a kink into the bound DNA and widens the minor groove. In summary, the most important three determinants at positions X, Y, and Z (Figure 5) are involved in it. All known nonspecific HMG box proteins have serine at position X, whereas all sequence-specific HMG boxes have an asparagine at this position (14, 27). The serine could form a watermediated interaction with DNA, as in HMG-D in which serine forms water-mediated bonds to the thymine 7 ribose O4 and adenine 6 N3 position of the DNA base. And asparagine, as in LEF1, could direct a hydrogen bond

network to three of the four bases of the C,A base pair. At position Y, the residue is hydrophobic in both types of HMG box proteins (Met in mLEF-1, HMG-D, and NHP6A and Ile in hSRY) and could intercalate between two base pairs to cause DNA bending. At position Z, another intercalating residue was found in non-sequence-specific HMG boxes, such as valine in HMG-D and phenylalanine in NHP6A. But in sequence-specific HMG boxes, the residues at position Z (serine in mLEF1 and TCF1 and asparagine in hSRY and mSOX5) are hydrophilic and are involved in a hydrogen bond to DNA. There are no structural data for the complex of the HMG box bound to a four-way DNA junction. Fortunately, the structure of the architecture-specific complex of HMG-1 box A, a non-sequence-specific HMG box, bound to cisplatin-modified DNA could provide some insight into it (36). On the basis of this structure, an intercalating residue phenylalanine at position Z was found to partially intercalate within the alreadly kinked DNA site. The hydrophobic intercalating residue at position Y is usually considered an initial and determinant step for HMG box protein binding to linear DNA. And DNA recognition at positions X and Z determines the sequence specificity in DNA binding, which was called a "sequence-neutral" mechanism for non-sequencespecific DNA recognition (27, 37). hUBF HMG box 5 shows some difference in electrostatic surface potential with respect to hUBF box 1 and all HMG boxes with known structures, including sequence-specific and

non-sequence-specific HMG boxes (Figure 5c only showing a non-sequence-specific HMG box, HMG-D, and a sequencespecific HMG box, LEF-1, with hUBF box 1 and hUBF box 5). In the concave DNA binding face, on the basis of the complexes of HMG boxes with known structures and DNA, a hydrophobic surface is predominantly flanked by a series of basic residues that is important in interacting with the DNA phosphodiester backbone. In hUBF box 5, the existence of acidic residues on this surface must have some effect on this interaction. Figure 5a shows the result of sequence alignment of hUBF HMG box 5 with hUBF HMG box 1 and some other HMG box proteins. In hUBF HMG box 5, three residues (R9, E12, and R30) are located at positions X, Y, and Z, respectively. By comparison, in hUBF HMG box 1, threonine, phenylalanine, and asparagine are at these positions. When a comparison of tertiary structure was drawn between hUBF box 5 and some other HMG boxes, it was found that the

residues at these positions are almost spatially conserved. Little difference exists at positions X and Y. In hUBF HMG box 5, K8 and E11 are in more similar spatial positions than R9 and E12 with respect to residues at positions X and Y in other HMG box proteins (Figure 5b). The hydrophobic residue phenylalanine at position Y, in hUBF box 1, was thought to intercalate into linear DNA and then bend it. But in hUBF HMG box 5, a glutamic acid residue is found at position Y, which is hydrophilic and could not be expected to intercalate into the DNA base pair. It could explain why hUBF HMG box 5, in contrast to hUBF HMG box 1, has a dramatic decrease in its binding affinity for linear DNA. hUBF box 1 has also a strong binding affinity for the four-way DNA junction (30). Although no intercalating residue exists at position Y, reasonably, the protein hUBF HMG box 5 could bind to predistorted DNA through another intercalating residue at position Z. But here hUBF box 5 shows a very weak affinity for the four-way

DNA junction. In hUBF HMG box 5, a positively charged residue, arginine, at position Z, supposedly, is difficult to efficiently intercalate into DNA. Also, it could not be supposed to form a hydrogen bond with DNA as sequencespecific HMG boxes. But in hUBF box 1, a negatively charged residue, asparagine, at this position could behave like sequence-specific HMG boxes to form a hydrogen bond with DNA. The threonine at position X in hUBF box 1 is similar to serine, which can form water-mediated hydrogen bonds to DNA bases like the nonspecific HMG box. But in hUBF box 5, a positively charged amino acid (K8 or R9 at this position) could not be expected to behave like serine or asparagine. It should be noted that hUBF box 5 is more elongated (seen from Figure 5) than other HMG boxes. It seems to indicate that its complementarity to the minor groove of DNA is less appropriate than that of other HMG boxes.

The question of why HMG box 5 undergoes such a change in structure and sequence content arises. As its ability in DNA binding has vanished, what other function was carried out by it? Previous works have suggested HMG boxes 3-6 and the acidic tail in hUBF contribute to the interaction of hUBF and TBP-TAFs complex hSL1 (6). As one part of this segment, hUBF HMG box 5 must play a role in it. More details about it need further study. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank Dr. F. Delagio and Prof. A.
