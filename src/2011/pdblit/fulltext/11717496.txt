The binding of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) to chicken egg lysozyme (E.C. 3.2.1.17) was investigated by high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction at room temperature. NAG was found to bind to lysozyme in a rapid precipitation preparation with 0.05 M NaCl buffer pH 6.0, but not 0.05 M NaCl buffer pH 5.0. Binding was indicated by signi®cant and readily apparent changes in the diffraction pattern from that of the apo protein precipitated from the same solvent. The location of NAG bound to lysozyme was easily found from a difference Fourier map generated from structure factors extracted during a preliminary combined Rietveld and stereochemical restraint re®nement. Full protein and protein±NAG structures were re®ned with these techniques (Rwp = 2.22±2.49%, Rp = 1.79± 1.95%, R2 = 4.95±6.35%) and revealed a binding mode for F NAG which differed from that found in an earlier singlecrystal study and probably represents a precursor trapped by rapid precipitation.

1. Introduction
With the decoding of the human and other genomes (Aldhous, 2000; Pennisi, 2000; Venter et al., 2001; International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2001), the paradigm of drug discovery will change to one that is focused on molecular design for interaction with speci®c proteins. This new emphasis on proteomics will require experimental veri®cation of the details of protein±ligand interactions under a wide variety of conditions. Current techniques either require formation of single crystals of the protein±ligand complex of suf®cient quality for X-ray diffraction work or else interpretation of NMR spectra. This work is dif®cult, as indicated by a cursory examination of the Protein Data Bank which shows only about 10% of the entries involve protein±ligand complexes. For the case considered here, after early crystallographic studies of chicken egg lysozyme (E.C. 3.2.1.17; Blake et al., 1962, 1965; Phillips, 1967) work immediately focused on the binding of mono- and oligosaccharides of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) to this protein (Johnson & Phillips, 1965; Blake et al., 1967; Perkins et al., 1978; Cheetham et al., 1992) to understand the molecular basis of the enzymatic cleavage of these materials and similar mucopolysaccharide components of bacterial cell walls (Rupley & Gates, 1967). For the NAG±lysozyme complex, single crystals were typically soaked for 24 h (Perkins et al., 1978). Cracking of the crystals was frequently observed and could be controlled only by careful selection of concentrations and pH. The soaking time and conditions were suf®cient to allow /-NAG interconversion, so that both anomers were found in this structure. Single crystals of the tri-N-acetylchitotriose (NAG3) complex

In a similar way, a polycrystalline sample of unbound lysozyme in 0.5 M NaCl buffer pH 6.0 was prepared. Similar samples with 0.5 M NaCl buffer pH 5.0 were also prepared. Samples were $8 mm long. As each sample was prepared, high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction data were immediately collected at room temperature (290 K) on beamline X3b1 at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory equipped with a double Si(111) monochromator and a Ge(111) analyser; the sample was spun during data collection to ensure good powder averaging. Details of the data collections are given in Table 1.

Chicken egg lysozyme (E.C. 3.2.1.17; FisherBiotech, 3Â crystallized, lot Nos. 995417-12 and 996924-12) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG; ICN Biomedicals, Inc. lot No. R9745) 0.05 M Na2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer pH 5.0 (Fisher Sci.), 0.05 M potassium hydrogen phthalate/NaOH buffer pH 5.0 (Hydrion, Aldrich Chemical Co.) and NaCl (`Certi®ed for Biological Use', Fisher Sci.) were used as received. In a typical sample preparation, a polycrystalline slurry was made by combining $20 mg lysozyme (1.4 mmol), $10 mg NAG (45 mmol) and 200 ml 0.5 M NaCl buffer pH 6.0 with an agate mortar and pestle. Polycrystalline precipitate formed within a few seconds. The slurry was loaded into a 1.5 mm diameter glass capillary and centrifuged to pack the slurry. Excess mother liquor was

Visual comparison of the diffraction patterns obtained from lysozyme and NAG±lysozyme polycrystalline slurries formed in 0.5 M NaCl buffer pH 6.0 (Fig. 1a) clearly show that a structural modi®cation has occurred associated with the formation of an NAG±lysozyme complex. The patterns show differences in peak positions, which arise from latticeparameter changes, and differences in intensity associated with the crystal structure modi®cation. There were no changes evident in a comparison of the powder patterns of lysozyme and NAG±lysozyme slurries prepared with 0.5 M NaCl buffer pH 5.0 (Fig. 1b). The crystal structures of lysozyme precipitated from the pH 5.0 and pH 6.0 buffers were subject to a combined Rietveld and stereochemical restraint least-squares re®nement using techniques described previously (Von Dreele, 1999; Von Dreele et al., 2000) and the General Structure Analysis System (GSAS; Larson & Von Dreele, 2000). The starting model for the lysozyme atom coordinates was taken from PDB entry 1rfp (Motoshima et al., 1997). Protein re®nement was achieved by constructing a band-diagonal approximation to the full matrix; band-matrix routines from the SLATEC suite (Fong et al., 1993) were adapted for use in GSAS. A matrix bandwidth of 300 parameters was chosen for re®nement of all lysozyme structures studied here. During both sets of Rietveld re®nements the resulting protein stereochemistry was periodically evaluated with the PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) suite of programs and graphically examined using the SwissPdbViewer package (Guex & Peitsch, 1999). Details of these re®nements are listed in Table 1 and the resulting ®tted powder diffraction pro®les are shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). The lysozyme structures obtained above were then used as starting models for the analysis of the lysozyme±NAG powder diffraction data. After preliminary combined Rietveld and stereochemical re®nements for the materials precipitated from both pH 6.0 (Rwp = 2.61%, Rp = 2.04%, R2 = 6.03%) and F pH 5.0 (residuals in Table 1) buffers, difference Fourier maps were constructed in each case by using structure factors extracted from the respective powder diffraction pro®les. This extraction process operates during the Rietveld re®nement by apportioning the observed diffraction pro®le above background among the contributing re¯ections according to the ratio of their calculated intensities. In this way, a set of integrated intensities are obtained for all re¯ections within the range of the powder pro®le; they are then subjected to the usual corrections for re¯ection multiplicity, Lorentz and

polarization to obtain a set of `observed' structure factors. The ÁF map (Fig. 3) prepared from these extracted intensities for the material precipitated from pH 6.0 buffer showed an extended region of density only in the vicinity of the previously identi®ed C sugar-binding site for lysozyme. In contrast, the ÁF map for the material prepared from pH 5.0 buffer showed only a few scattered peaks in this region. A model for the lysozyme±NAG complex formed from pH 6.0 buffer was developed by placing a NAG molecule in the -anomer form to best ®t the ÁF map density. After preliminary re®nement of the position and orientation of the -NAG molecule as a rigid body, the entire -NAG±lysozyme complex was subjected to combined Rietveld and stereochemical re®nement. Fig. 3 shows the re®ned position of the -NAG molecule relative to the ÁF map density. The results of this re®nement are given in Table 1, the resulting ®tted powder diffraction pro®le is shown in Fig. 4 and drawings of the structure are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. an effective crystallite size of 4±10 mm for the materials prepared from the pH 6.0 buffer and 0.4±1.2 mm for those prepared from the pH 5.0 buffer; the microstrain for both pH 6.0 samples was 0.02±0.08% and no microstrain broadening was observed for the pH 5.0 materials. Evidently, all of the polycrystalline lysozyme samples, prepared here as precipitate, appear to be essentially free of lattice defects and are quite homogeneous, with no variability in lattice parameters. This is in apparent contrast to some reports of differences in single crystals of lysozyme selected from the same solution (Corey et al., 1962; Cheetham et al., 1992). In the present study, the lattice parameters of lysozyme and -NAG±lysozyme complex (Table 1) have been determined with unprecedented precision via powder diffraction. The precision obtained here approaches one part in 80 000 and is the result of Rietveld re®nement ®tting of the entire powderdiffraction pro®le and the extreme sharpness of the peaks; we obtained similar precision in our earlier powder diffraction studies of metmyoglobin and Zn insulin complexes (Von Dreele, 1999; Von Dreele et al., 2000). Consequently, small changes in these values with pH and complex formation are readily apparent and can even be discerned from a simple visual comparison (Figs. 1a and 1b). The lattice parameters obtained here for lysozyme prepared from 0.5 M NaCl buffer pH 6.0 most closely resemble values (e.g. a = 79.21, c = 37.97; Motoshima et al. 1997) typically given for single crystals obtained from pH 4.7 solutions. Polycrystalline lysozyme prepared from 0.5 M NaCl buffer pH 5.0 gave distinctly different lattice parameters with a smaller by 0.71% and c larger by 1.26%. As there is essentially no change in unit-cell volume, it is unlikely that these changes in lattice parameters with pH are a consequence of changes in protein hydration but are more likely to arise from a subtle change in protein conformation. The measured pH values for our preparations are quite close (4.8 and 5.2) so the transition between these two lysozyme structures may be quite sharp. Since single crystals of lysozyme are typically grown at a pH very close to

3. Discussion
Our previous high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction studies with metmyoglobin (Von Dreele, 1999) and T3R3 Zn insulin complexes (Von Dreele et al., 2000) used samples obtained by grinding previously crystallized protein in its mother liquor and yielded material with extremely sharp diffraction peaks and little or no sample broadening. The apparent crystallite sizes in these cases were on the order of 1 mm and the microstrain broadening effects were less than 0.1%. In the present study, polycrystalline material has been prepared from amorphous lyophilized protein and relatively high-salt buffered solvents. Based on the solubility study of Rosenbaum & Zukoski (1996), the preparation conditions described here are at a lysozyme concentration that exceeds the solubility limit (2.0 mg mlÀ1 at pH 4.7 and 0.5 M ionic strength) by about a factor of 50. In all cases, we obtain polycrystalline material that gives extremely sharp diffraction patterns. Interpretation (Larson & Von Dreele, 1986) of the X, Xe, Y and Ye coef®cients (Table 1) obtained from the Rietveld re®nements gives

this transition, reports of differences in single crystals of lysozyme selected from the same solution (Corey et al., 1962; Cheetham et al., 1992) may have a ready explanation in that some have the higher pH structure while others have the lower pH one. Formation of the -NAG±lysozyme complex from 0.5 M NaCl pH 6.0 was marked by easily visible changes in the powder diffraction patterns (Fig. 1a) and signi®cant changes in the lattice parameters. For the complex, a is smaller by 0.21% and c larger by 0.49% compared with those of the apo protein precipitated from the same buffer. This change upon complex formation is consistent with the lower precision single-crystal values obtained by Perkins et al. (1978) and, interestingly, those obtained by Cheetham et al. (1992) for the NAG3± lysozyme complex. The precipitate from a NAG±lysozyme mixture in 0.5 M NaCl pH 5.0 showed no visible change in the powder pattern (Fig. 1b) from that of pure lysozyme prepared from the same solvent; the lattice parameters are also essentially unchanged (a is smaller by 0.06% and c is larger by 0.15%). The structural orientation of the -NAG molecule found in this powder diffraction experiment is different from that obtained previously from single-crystal diffraction data (Perkins et al., 1978). Both studies ®nd that the -NAG molecule occupies the C site, but this powder study shows it to be essentially rotated 180 about the sugar-ring axis with respect to the orientation seen in the single-crystal study (cf. Fig. 3). Also, in contrast to the single-crystal result, this powder study shows no evidence of any -NAG in the structure. A number of checks were employed to test the validity of this result. A Rietveld re®nement of the site fractions for -NAG molecules placed in both orientations clearly preferred the powder one (>80%) instead of the single-crystal one (<20%) given by Perkins et al. (1978). A similar re®nement of the powder site fraction alone for -NAG indicated essentially 100% occupancy. Moreover, a comparison (Fig. 3) of the two orientations to the ÁF map obtained here shows a much better match for -NAG in the powder orientation; in particular, the N-acetyl group in the single-crystal orientation falls in a relatively low-density region. Consequently, a different pattern of four potential hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5) is used to hold the NAG molecule in the C site; these are Ê Ê NAG O3±Gln57 O (3.06 A), NAG O4±Ala107 O (2.55 A), Ê NAG O5±Asn59 N2 (2.99 A) and NAG O7±Asp52 O2 Ê (3.17 A). This last interaction may in fact not be a hydrogen bond, as the donor±acceptor distance is rather long and the acidic Asp C OOH is probably ionized under the pH conditions of the sample (Bonincontro et al., 1998) so no H atom would be available for the bond. Thus, the N-acetyl group is not held in its speci®c binding pocket by the hydrogen bonds NAG N2±Asn59 N and NAG O6±Trp62 N41 as seen in the single-crystal study and the structure obtained here (Fig. 6) probably represents a precursor trapped by rapid precipitation. The lack of any -NAG in this precipitated complex is probably owing to the slow / conversion from the -form present in the solid NAG used to make up this sample; in contrast, the slow soaking procedure used by Perkins et al.
Acta Cryst. (2001). D57, 1836±1842

(1978) ensured that an equilibrium mixture of /-NAG was available for complex formation and consequently both anomers were found in the single-crystal structure. Apparently, the NAG±lysozyme complex did not form under rapid precipitation from 0.5 M NaCl buffer pH 5.0 despite the more than 30-fold excess of NAG in the preparation. Careful examination of a ÁF map prepared in the same way as the pH 6.0 material show no extended density anywhere; only scattered peaks probably arising from bound water molecules were observed. Additionally, the re®ned lysozyme structures for the two pH 5.0 samples, one prepared with NAG and the other without, were virtually identical; the RMS distance between the two sets of backbone atoms was Ê only 0.17 A. In comparison, the RMS distance between the backbone atoms of the pH 6.0 materials prepared with and Ê without NAG was 0.52 A, indicating a change in the protein structure with complex formation. The lysozyme structure is quite pH dependent; the RMS distance between the backbone atoms of the uncomplexed pH 5.0 and pH 6.0 materials is Ê 0.98 A. Evidently, this structural change with pH is suf®cient to prevent NAG binding under the conditions of rapid precipitation at lower pH. The effect is quite subtle, as careful Ê residue-by-residue comparison of these moderate ($3 A) powder diffraction structures did not show an obvious structural change that would inhibit NAG binding to the protein prepared from pH 5.0 buffer. Clearly, as we had observed earlier for metmyoglobin (Von Dreele, 1999) and T3R3 Zn insulin (Von Dreele et al., 2000), polycrystalline lysozyme and NAG±lysozyme powders, prepared in this case by rapid precipitation, consist of essentially defect-free crystallites that are a few micrometres across. As noted by us earlier, these dimensions suggest that the crystallites are only a few hundred protein unit cells in extent which, when coupled with the relatively weak binding between adjacent molecules, is insuf®cient to retain point and line defects at ambient temperature. Consequently, powder diffraction patterns of these materials give diffraction peaks that are as sharp as can be obtained from a given diffraction instrument; this may be a common feature of ambient temperature protein powder diffraction patterns. In essence, proteins are `perfect' powders for diffraction. In the work described here, the extreme sharpness of these patterns arose from the uniform and easily controlled precipitation conditions and allowed easy discernment of the small structural changes associated with protein±ligand complex formation and ready discrimination from cases where no complex is formed. Moreover, the quality of the powder diffraction pattern was suf®cient to determine the detailed structural features of the protein±ligand complex. Thus, it is likely that high-resolution powder diffraction can facilitate both the screening for protein±ligand interactions and the determination of their resulting structures under a wide variety of conditions.1
