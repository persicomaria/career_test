PhoB is the response regulator of the two-component signal transduction system activated under phosphate starvation conditions. This protein is a transcription factor that activates more than 30 genes of the pho regulon and consists of two domains: a DNA binding domain and a dimerization domain, the latter being homologous to the receiver domain described for two-component response regulators. Activation by phosphorylation induces dimerization of the protein and the consequent binding to the DNA direct repeat pho box, where it promotes the binding of RNA polymerase. In the absence of phosphorylation, the activating dimerization process can be mimicked by deletion of the DNA binding domain. The three-dimensional crystal structure of the receiver domain of PhoB from Escherichia coli has been solved by multiple anomalous diffraction using a gold derivative obtained by co-crystallization, and re®ned using data to Ê 1.9 A resolution. The crystal structure reveals an a/b doubly wound fold, similar to other known receivers, the most conspicuous difference being the displacement of helix a4 towards its N terminus. The active site includes the acidic triad Asp53 (the site of phosphorylation), Asp10 and Glu9. Lys105, from loop b5a5, and Glu88, from helix a4, interact with Asp53 via an H-bond and a water bridge, respectively. In the asymmetric unit of the crystal there are two molecules linked by a complementary hydrophobic surface, which involves helix a1, loop b5a5 and the N terminus of helix a5, and is connected to the active site through the fully conserved residue Lys105 from loop b5a5. The possibility that this surface is the functional surface used for the activating dimerization is discussed.

Introduction
In Escherichia coli and other bacteria a two-component signal transduction system is activated under inorganic phosphate starvation conditions. This system consists of the transmembrane sensor kinase PhoR, and a response regulator, the transcription factor PhoB, which is activated by the transfer of a phosphate group from the former in the presence of magnesium (Makino et al., 1989). Once activated, PhoB induces the gene expression of the phosphate (pho) regulon (Shinagawa et al., 1983). This regulon includes operons and genes, whose products are involved in phosphorus

uptake and metabolism, among other functions (Wanner, 1996). Many other exterior signals are transmitted to the inside of the cell by a phosphorelay between a sensor kinase and a response regulator, allowing the microorganism to adapt to the changing environmental conditions. More than 60 such systems have been identi®ed to date involved, among other processes, in sporulation (Burbulys et al., 1991; Hoch, 1993), competence (Dubnau, 1991), chemotaxis (Stock et al., 1992), nitrogen assimilation (Reitzer & Magasanik, 1983) and osmoregulation (Hall & Silhavy, 1981, Pratt & Silhavy, 1995); even vancomycine resistance has been developed through a two-component signal transduction system (Arthur et al., 1992). These systems not only show great diversity in signal speci®city but also are spread through over more

They have been found also in eukaryotes such as the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Chang et al., 1993) and the fungi Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ota & Varshavsky, 1993; Maeda et al., 1994) and Neurospora crassa (Alex et al., 1995). Three-dimensional structures for four response regulators have been reported, namely the chemotaxis regulator CheY of both Salmonella typhimurium (Stock et al., 1989) and Escherichia coli (Volz & Matsumura, 1991; Santoro et al., 1995; Moy et al., 1994), the Bacillus subtilis sporulation initiation response regulator Spo0F (Madhusudan et al., 1996), NarL from E. coli, which is part of the nitrate-dependent regulation system (Baikalov et al., 1996), and S. typhimurium NtrC, involved in nitrogen regulation (Volkman et al., 1995). As sequence alignments suggested, all these molecules contain a 120 to 125-residue receiver domain where the response regulators are phosphorylated by their corresponding kinases (Stock et al., 1990; Parkinson & Kofoid, 1992). The general fold is an a/b doubly wound pattern (Richardson & Richardson, 1990) consisting of a central ®ve-stranded parallel bsheet surrounded with ®ve a-helices. The residues involved in the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation activity cluster in these structures around an acidic pocket located at the C terminus of the bsheet. From sequence alignment it is shown that these catalytic residues are highly conserved among response regulators (Stock et al., 1990; Volz,

1993). The most conserved residues in the active site are Asp53 (following the PhoB sequence numbering, Figure 1), which is the proposed phosphorylation site in PhoB (Makino et al., 1989, Hiratsu et al., 1995), and Lys105 for which an activating role upon phosphorylation has also been suggested in CheY (Lukat et al., 1991; Bellsolell et al., 1996). Two more active-site residues are at PhoB positions 9 and 10, always occupied by acidic residues in the different receivers (Bourret et al., 1990; Volz, 1993). Importantly, the crystal structure of CheY in complex with magnesium (Stock et al., 1993; Bellsolell et al., 1994) shows that the three acidic residues 9, 10 and 53 directly or indirectly coordinate the magnesium ion needed for phosphorylation. There are other conserved non-activesite residues such as the one at position 83, not far from the acidic pocket, always occupied by threonine or serine. Also Gly61 is a highly conserved residue. It is located at the beginning of a3, after a ¯apped loop near the active site. This ¯apped loop is characteristic of all known receiver structures and both in NarL and CheY include a g-turn. Position 102 is mostly occupied by tyrosine or phenylalanine (Volz, 1993). Apart from the receiver domain, response regulators can have contiguous output domains by which the molecule performs its speci®c task once phosphorylated. Classi®cation of the response regulators can be performed based on output domain sequences. In particular, PhoB contains a

The arrows (b-strands) and cylinders (a-helices) correspond to PhoB. In the sequences, the b-strands and a-helices are shaded in dark and light gray, respectively. The boxes in the PhoB sequence indicate residues that participate in molecule-molecule contacts. Residues in the active site area are highlighted in bold. The numbering corresponds to the PhoB sequence.

677 dimerization can be achieved by the excision of the output DNA-binding domain as well as by phosphorylation (Fiedler & Weiss, 1995). Here we report the three-dimensional crystal structure of the receiver domain of PhoB from E. coli. The active site is described in detail and a comparison with the other known receivers is made. Finally a putative activating dimerization surface is analysed.

C-terminal domain of about 100 residues that groups the molecule into the DNA-binding domain s70 RNA-polymerase subunit-dependent class (Pao & Saier, 1995), and presumably this domain contains a winged-helix motif as seen in the related OmpR protein (Pao & Saier, 1995; MartinezHackert & Stock, 1997). PhoB binds to a speci®c DNA sequence called pho box located at the promoters of the pho regulon genes, ten base-pairs upstream of the Pribnow box (Makino et al., 1986, 1996; Kim et al., 1993). The consensus sequence for the pho box consists of a seven-base-pair direct repeat separated by a four-base-pair segment rich in A(T) bases (Makino et al., 1986). As a transcription factor, PhoB mediates the binding of RNA polymerase to the pho promoters through a direct interaction with the s70 subunit (Kim et al., 1993, 1995; Makino et al., 1988, 1993). A dimeric form of PhoB is believed to perform the RNA polymerase binding mediation because of the repeat in the pho box sequence (Makino et al., 1989; McCleary, 1996). In fact, it has been shown that PhoB dimerizes, and dimerization is enhanced upon phosphorylation (Fiedler & Weiss, 1995; McCleary, 1996). Moreover, it has been reported that the activating

Results and Discussion
Global structure The global structure of the PhoB receiver domain consists of an a/b doubly wound fold (Figure 2(a)). Five b-strands form a central parallel b-sheet with two a-helices on one face of the sheet (a1, a5) and three on the other face (a2, a3, a4). The active site pocket is located at the C terminus of the b-sheet. Strands and helices alternate along the primary sequence (Figure 1) and the topology of the b-sheet is b2b1b3b4b5. Helices and strands are tightly connected by turns and short loops at b1a1, a1b2, b2a2, b4a4 and b5a5. The longest loop is at a3b4, comprising

Note that the loop a4b4, at the top of the Figure, does not participate in inter-protein contacts although being located in the same face of the interacting surface.

678 ten residues from Lys69 to Pro78. The loop b3a3 includes residues Trp54 to Ser60 and forms a ¯ap at the C-terminal edge of the b-sheet, on top of the a3 cylinder and not far away from the active site. Loop a4b5 includes the six residues from Leu95 to Asp100. Helices a2, a3 and a5 are well N-capped by the side-chains of residues Asp34, Ser60 and Ser108, respectively. Glu11 and Glu87 are located at the N terminus of helices a1 and a4, with their side-chains pointing to the helix axis, but they do not form H-bonds with helix main-chain NH groups. Helix a1 and a4 are C-capped by Gly26 and Gly94, respectively. At the centre of the parallel sheet, b3 is the most buried strand. The most exposed a-helix is a4, with only one buried hydrophobic residue, Val92, at the packing interface with the central b-sheet. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, referred to from now on as A and B. Figure 3(a) shows a superposition of the two molecules. The differences arise mainly from the loops surrounding the active site and helix a3, Ê the latter being displaced for aproximately 2.5 A towards its N terminus in molecule B. This difference in the a3 position might be due to different crystal packing environments, since in molecule A there are contacts with neighbouring molecules, which is not the case for molecule B. The different position of helix a3 in each molecule is related to the different shapes of the characteristic ¯apped loop b3a3 in each molecule: in molecule A it forms a wider and shorter hairpin than in molecule B. Here again the environments are different with residue Ser60 and Gly59 of molecule A having H-bonds and Gly58 van der Waals contacts with a symmetry-related molecule while less contacts are found in molecule B. This might be related to higher temperature factors in this area in molecule B, residues 57 and 58 being disordered, and therefore any comparisons in this ¯ap must be done with caution. The loop b2a2 and the N-terminal part of a2 are also slightly shifted when comparing both molecules. For Ê example, the Ca atoms of Tyr35 deviate 1.6 A. This is not surprising, since the side-chain of this residue interacts with helix a3 whose position is different in the two molecules, as indicated above. Other areas where the molecules differ are the loops b4a4 and b5a5 (see below). Excluding weakly de®ned areas, the rms deviation between Ê equivalent Ca atoms is 1.0 A. This re¯ects the signi®cant differences between the two molecules and underlines a characteristic of the receiver proteins, that is the plasticity of the overall structure, in particular the position of helical secondary structure elements. This was already noticed by McEvoy et al. (1998) in the complex of CheY with the P2 domain of CheA, where two molecules are present in the asymmetric unit with large rms deviations between them and with the known free CheY structures. The plasticity of the receiver is probably related to its function.

Structure of PhoB Receiver Domain

Comparison with other receiver domains Figure 3(b) shows the superimposition of the Ca-traces of the receiver domain of PhoB with the apo (Volz & Matsumura, 1991) and Mg2-bound structures (Bellsolell et al., 1994) of E. coli CheY. In Figure 3(c) the PhoB receiver domain is superimposed with Spo0F (Madhusudan et al., 1996), and the receiver domain of NarL (Baikalov et al., 1996). Of all these molecules, the receiver domain of PhoB superimposes best with CheY, and in particular with the Mg2-bound form of this protein, Ê with a rms deviation of 1.69 A for all Ca atoms. For the comparison with apo-CheY, Spo0F and NarL the rms deviations in Ca atoms are 1.86, 2.20 Ê and 3.01 A, respectively. The main differences between CheY and the PhoB receiver domain are at helix a4. In PhoB this helix is shifted along the helical axis and the primary sequence, one turn towards the N terminus. This is clearly seen in the superimposition shown in Figure 3(b) and also in Figure 1, where the sequences are aligned and the secondary structure elements depicted. This means that, in PhoB, the b4a4 loop is shorter and the a4b5 loop longer than in CheY. The same is true with respect to apo-CheY, Spo0F, and the receiver domain of NarL. Another difference between PhoB and all other receivers is found at helix a2 which is shorter in PhoB, with almost one turn less at its C terminus (Figures 1, and 3(b) and (c)). Active site The active site is located at a crevice formed by loops b1a1 and b3a3, as occurs in other proteins having a nucleotide binding fold (Rao & Rossmann, 1977). The last residue of strand b3, Asp53 (Figure 4(a) and (b)), is the putative phosphorylation site and establishes a salt-bridge with Ê Lys105 (3.1 A), the last residue of b5. The Lys105 amino group also interacts with Glu9 by a saltÊ bridge (2.6 A) in molecule A (Figure 4(a)) or a water-bridge in molecule B (Figure 4(b)). The lysine methylene groups are surrounded by hydrophobic side-chains, including Ile14 from helix a1, and Leu82 and Ala84 of strand b4. This hydrophobic valley favours the back and forth movement of the Lys105 side-chain (Bellsolell et al., 1996). The neighbour of Lys105, Pro106, displays the characteristic cis conformation found in all receivers solved to date which have proline in this position. This is related to the required inwards orientation of the lysine side-chain towards the active site (Volz, 1993). PhoB has, with Glu9, Asp10 and Glu11, three acidic residues in a row. According to the magnesium-bound CheY structures (Stock et al., 1993; Bellsolell et al., 1994), Asp10 and Asp53 are the ones that most probably coordinate the magnesium ion needed for phosphorylation. Glu9 side-chain is also in close proximity, although the equivalent residue in CheY (Asp12) was found not to directly coordinate the metal ion but a water molecule of the mag-

nesium octahedral coordination sphere (Bellsolell et al., 1994). In CheY, the corresponding residue to Glu11 is Phe14, a residue that was found interacting with the Mg2 cluster in the metal-bound structure of CheY. In PhoB, Glu11 has different conformations in each molecule. In molecule B it points to the active site pocket with a water-mediated (W72) bridge to Lys105 (Figure 4(b)). In molecule A the side-chain points in the opposite direction, towards the solvent (Figure 4(a)). In the active site of molecule A, water molecule W1 is H-bonded to the Od2 atom of Asp53 and the Od1 atom of Asp10, in similar fashion as the Mg2 is coordinated in CheY (Figure 4(a)). This water molecule was the strongest peak in the difference map calculated before introduction of any solvent molecule and has the lowest B-factor of all water Ê molecules (17.6 A2). The possibility that it corresponds to a metal ion such as Na was considered, but comparisons with the Mg2-CheY structure were inconclusive because this water molecule does not occupy the exact position of the magÊ nesium ion, which is 2.9 A removed from it. More-

over, besides the binding to the two aspartate residues, W1 is also interacting with the amide nitrogen atom of Asp10, which is not the case of the magnesium cation in CheY. And ®nally, in the PhoB structure, the third equivalent protein oxygen that coordinates the metal ion in CheY is not H-bonded to water W1. This is the carbonyl oxygen of Met55 that, in molecule A, would not be pointing in the right direction to coordinate the metal. Nevertheless, in molecule B it has the right orientation, indicating that a rotation of 114  in the f angle places it in a coordinating position. There is a second water molecule at the active site in molecule B, W72, located just at the position of one of the water molecules of the magnesium cluster in CheY, establishing a strong H-bond to the Oe2 Ê atom of Glu9 (2.6 A), as the corresponding residue Asp12 does in CheY. Non-active site residues Note that Od1 of Asp53 is the putative oxygen atom where phosphorylation occurs, as shown by

Structure of PhoB Receiver Domain

681 residue that approaches to Asp53 is Glu88. This residue is at the N terminus of the exposed helix a4 and, in molecule A, W5 water-bridges its Oe2 to Od1 of Asp53 (Figures 4(a) and 5(a)). A connection between (b4a4 and b5a5 loops occurs through Arg85. Figure 4(a) shows the Hbonds between the side-chain of Arg85 (loop b4a4) and the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Pro106 Ê (loop b5a5) (2.6 A), and the bond between the amide main-chain of Arg85 and carbonyl oxygen Ê of Lys105 (3.1 A). The link between the Arg85 side-chain and the b5a5 main-chain is ¯exible as molecule B demonstrates (Figure 4(b)), where the Ê NH(Arg85)± O(Lys105) H-bond is weaker (3.5 A). This weakening in molecule B is a consequence of the increasing in the distance between both loops, due to movement of Lys105 towards the active site and, with it, the loop b5a5. The two slightly different positions of loop b5a5 con®rm that, although it is rigid because of the cis-Pro (Santoro et al., 1995), it can vibrate back and forth from the active site (Bellsolell et al. 1996). Neighbouring the invariable Asp53 there is another conserved residue, Trp54. Binding of Mg2 to CheY causes intrinsic ¯uorescence quenching probably due to changes in the environment of this residue, i.e. the stacking of Glu93 over the tryptophan ring (Bellsolell et al., 1994). In PhoB, Trp54 is at the interface of helix a4 and the core of the protein, and pointing towards it there is Val92 (Figure 5(a) and (b)). Note that Val92 is the only buried residue of a4. The w2 angle of Trp54 in PhoB is À112  , while in apo-CheY and Mg2-CheY it is À107  and À52  , respectively. The differences in the orientation of the ring in both PhoB molecules are, as in the rest of the known receiver domain structures, related to the differences in helix a4. Close to the invariant Lys105 there is Tyr102. In CheY, the equivalent tyrosine 106 has been suggested to be involved in the activation process (Zhu et al., 1996, 1997a). It has been observed in all three rotamers in different CheY structures and its orientation is also related to conformational changes in helix a4. For example, in the apo-CheY structure (Volz & Matsumura, 1991), it was found disordered between two alternative conformations, that is gaucheÀ and trans. In the Mg-CheY structure the rotamer is gauche (Bellsolell et al., 1994). In the gÀ rotamer the ring is exposed to the solvent. In the t rotamer the ring occupies a hydrophobic pocket with the -OH group pointing to the N terminus helix a4. In the g rotamer it points to the C terminus of the helix. In PhoB, Tyr102 is in the g conformation, as in the Mg-bound structure, with w1 angles of À43  and À54  in A and B molecules, respectively (Figure 5(a) and (b)). As mentioned before, this conformation is related to the position of helix a4. For example, the t orientation of the ring would not be possible in the present structure of PhoB, since severe clashes will occur with Glu89 at the ®rst turn of a4.

modeling a phosphate moiety bound to this residue on the Mg2-CheY structure (data not shown). In molecule A, Od1 of Asp53 is, in addition to being H-bonded to the Nz side-chain atom of Ê Lys105 and water molecule W5, at 3.4 A distance from the carbonyl oxygen of Thr83 (Figures 4(a) and 5(b)). This is not a H-bond since both oxygen atoms are H-bond acceptors, but it is important to notice that this short distance implies that a phosphate group at Od1 of Asp53 could have a direct effect on Thr83. Residue Thr83 has been implicated in activation and its mutation to Ile impairs signaling in CheY (Zhu et al., 1997a). It is at the C terminus of b4 (Figure 5(a), (b)) and its side-chain is oriented towards the N terminus of a4 as in CheY and Spo0F. On the other hand, another important

682 Interaction between molecules The two PhoB receiver molecules in the asymmetric unit are intimately linked through a complementary surface which forms a small hydrophobic core interface. The two proteins are oriented with their b-sheets almost parallel but slightly inclined, with both b-sheet C termini converging towards the local 2-fold axis (Figure 2(a)). This implies that the active site pockets are very close to each other, forming a wide electronegative depression around the local axis. The interacting surface is perfectly complementary in shape with the protrusions of each molecule ®tting on the depressions of the other one (Figure 2(b)). A detailed analysis of the interaction between both molecules (Jones & Thornton, 1997) shows that the interface has a circular and planar shape and con®rms it is highly complementary (the index for the free or gap volume at the interface is 1.75, well below the 2.2 mean for 32 homodimeric structures (Jones & Thornton, 1996)). The secondary structure segments involved in the interaction are helix a1, the loop b5a5 and the N terminus of helix a5. Ê Thus, the interface extends to 560 A2 and forms a small hydrophobic core involving Pro13, Ile14, Met17, Phe20, Val21, Pro106, Phe107 and Pro109 from both molecules. At the edge, three hydrogen bonds and two water-bridges are found. It has been proposed that the binding to the DNA direct repeat pho box implies the dimerization of the protein (Makino et al., 1989). Biochemical studies have demonstrated that, upon phosphorylation, the entire PhoB protein dimerizes (McCleary, 1996). Furthermore, the receiver domain of PhoB is able to form dimers, even unphosphorylated, when the DNA-binding domain is removed (Fiedler & Weiss, 1995). The receiver domain is therefore responsible for the dimerization of PhoB and the DNA-binding domain an inhibitor of dimerization. The structure described here shows that two molecules of the receiver domain of PhoB can interact through a self-complementary surface that could be the functional surface used for dimerization. This surface is, in PhoB, more hydrophobic than the equivalent surface in a receiver that does not dimerize, as CheY. CheY contains a threonine (Thr16) at the equivalent site of Pro13 in PhoB, an asparagine (Asn23) at the site of Phe20 and an alanine (Ala113) at the position of Pro109. On the other hand, in the Mg2-bound PhoB receiver structure (unpublished results), crystallized in a different space group, there are three independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. Two of them have the same interaction as the one reported here. The third molecule also shows this kind of interaction but with a symmetry-related molecule. This strengthens the hypothesis that the two molecules might be forming indeed the functional dimer, but we have to caution that another type of proteinprotein interaction is observed in Mg2-PhoB structure as well, in this case involving the surface

determined by a4-b5-a5. Interestingly, the latter surface is the one used by CheY to interact with the transmitter protein or histidine kinase CheA, as reported in their binary complex structures (Welch et al., 1998; McEvoy et al., 1998). A model for the activation mechanism Activation of PhoB is achieved by means of phosphorylation and, in this protein, activation implies dimerization. In the absence of the phosphorylated species we can only infer how PhoB is activated. Phosphorylation can stimulate dimerization through two non-excluding ways: affecting the position of some residues at the dimerization surface increasing the af®nity for the other monomer or/and causing a movement between domains that releases the dimerization inhibition. The structure here described cannot address the second issue, since the DNA-binding domain is absent and its position relative to the receiver domain is uncertain. Regarding the ®rst possibility, the PhoB receiver structure shows that there is a topological connectivity between the active site and the proposed dimerization surface (Figures 2(b), and 4(a) and (b)). Role of loop b5a5 Let us consider ®rstly Lys105, which is located within loop b5a5. Mutational studies in CheY have shown that the equivalent residue to Lys105 is related to activation (Lukat et al., 1991; Bourret et al., 1993) and a back and forth movement has been described for this residue (Bellsolell et al., 1996). In PhoB, phosphorylation at the Od1 of Asp53 would affect the position of the Nz group of Lys105, causing such a displacement of this residue affecting both its side and main-chains and spreading over the loop b5a5. This loop is part of the putative dimerization surface as it contains both the conserved cis-Pro106 and Phe107 interacting, respectively, with Pro13 and Met17 of the other molecule. These residues form perfectly ®tted complementary hydrophobic surfaces (Figure 2(b)). A small movement involving them could change the complementarity of the dimerization surface, causing an increase or reduction of the af®nity between both molecules. Flexibility of a4 Another zone connected to the active site is the b4-a4 area. It contains several residues for which mutational studies in CheY indicate a functional role (Roman et al., 1992; Sockett et al., 1992; Ganguli et al., 1995; Zhu et al., 1997a,b). Helix a4 and its preceding and following loops are rather ¯exible areas, as indicated by the disorder and above average temperature factors observed in molecule B. Moreover, helix a4 is in PhoB mostly exposed and badly packed against the core. Therefore, because this area is connected to the active

683 for CheY, were the phosphorylated protein interacts with the ¯agellum ``gear'' protein FliM (Khan et al., 1978; Ravid et al., 1986; Sockett et al., 1992). It is noteworthy that the area involved in inter-molecular contacts in PhoB overlaps the CheY interaction surface with FliM, as determined by mutant suppressor studies (Zhu et al., 1997b; Roman et al., 1992). In the case of PhoB, phosphorylation stimulates a different kind of proteinprotein interaction than in CheY, that is, its own dimerization which enhances binding to the target DNA. In light of the present structure, however, both proteins most probably share a similar molecular switch mechanism.

site, changes in the latter can easily trigger large movements on the former, which has a marginal stability. For example, phosphorylation at Asp53 will lead to the breakage of the Glu88-W5-Asp53 water-bridge. Subsequent movement of Glu88 either away from or towards the active site pocket could seriously affect the packing of helix a4. Also the main chain at Thr83-Ala84 can be directly affected by the phosphorylation at Asp53. Based on the fact that the side-chain of Thr83 is at the interface between helix a4 and the b-sheet core of the protein (Figure 5(a), (b)), its movement can alter the N terminus of a4 and the b4a4 loop. Although not interacting directly with Asp53, Arg85 is another residue from loop b4a4 linked to the active site through the loop b5a5. The b4a4 loop is not involved in the protein-protein contacts here described. However, the top of Figure 2(a) shows that this loop is on the same face as the interaction surface, close to the local dyad axis. Note that if the functional dimerization surface was the face a4-b5-a5, as observed in one of the inter-molecular interactions in Mg2-PhoB, instead of the face a1-loop b5a5, as in the present structure, it would also be affected by movements of the b5a5 loop and obviously by changes in a4. In this alternative hypothesis, a residue like Tyr102, which is part of a5 and has its side-chain at the packing interface of a4, would be directly involved in the interaction. Concluding remark The activation of response regulators impels a protein-protein interaction. This is at least the case

Methods
Cloning, overexpression, purification, crystallization and native data set collection of the receiver domain Cloning, overexpression, puri®cation, crystallization and native data set collection of PhoB receiver domain from Escherichia coli is described in detail elsewhere Á (Sola et al., 1998). Crystals belong to the P212121 orthorÊ hombic space group with cell parameters a  34.11 A, Ê Ê b  60.42 A and c  119.97 A. The native crystals diffract Ê up to 1.88 A resolution (Table 1). Multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) As no success was achieved either applying molecular Á replacement or isomorphic replacement techniques (Sola et al., 1998), a multiple anomalous diffraction experiment (MAD) was undertaken at DESY (Hamburg). Several MAD trials were performed with crystals soaked in

uranium, platinum and mercurial compounds-containing solutions that caused large anisomorphism. These trials failed either because they did not produce the appropriate anomalous signal, although the suitable wavelengths for the speci®c absorption edges were used, or the difference Patterson maps did not show any clear heavy atom position. Finally, co-crystallization in the presence of a gold compound, 0.25 mM potassium dicyanoaurate (I), yielded a crystal displaying a good anomalous signal. This crystal was kept at 100 K by cryo-cooling and protection from freezing was achieved by harvesting the crystal in a solution with the native mother liquor compounds increased by a factor of 150 % except for the sodium acetate, which beyond 0.45 M caused salt diffraction rings. A preliminary ¯uorescence XANES spectrum around the Au L-III edge (11.919 keV) from the washed crystal revealed a measurable anomalous diffracÊ tion signal. Diffraction data sets up to 2.5 A were collected at the X31 tuneable beamline (EMBL) at DORIS (DESY, Hamburg) on a 180-mm-MAR Research image plate detector at four wavelengths with 1  of oscillation range (Table 1). The ®rst data set, L1, was collected at a wavelength somewhat above the one that maximizes the Ê Friedel mates anomalous difference, at l  1.0349 A (11.981 keV). The second data set, L2, was collected at Ê the absorbancy in¯ection point at l  1.0402 A (11.919 keV), to get the maximum dispersive differences. Two more data sets, L3 and L4, were collected at wavelengths remote from and far below the in¯ection point, with Ê Ê values of 0.83 A (15.050 keV) and 1.06 A (11.700 keV), respectively. Each data set was indexed and processed with DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The frozen Ê co-crystal cell had axes with values a  32.89 A, Ê Ê b  59.86 A and c  115.3 A, the ®rst and the last about 3.5 % smaller than the frozen native crystal cell, with an Ê associated Vm parameter (Matthews, 1968) of 1.97 A3/ Da with two molecules per asymmetric unit. The anomalous signal of the L1 and L2 data sets was detected by ®rst scaling the Bijvoets pairs separately and later merging them, with SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The four data sets were scaled relative to L2 as the reference, since this set has the highest completeness and lowest anomalous Rmerge. Then the data were merged and truncated and ®nally rescaled together obtaining statistics on dispersive and anomalous differences, with SCALA (CCP4, 1994; see Table 1). Phasing and initial model building Anomalous Patterson synthesis was calculated using the CCP4 suite (CCP4, 1994). With data sets L1 and L2, which yielded a strong peak at the three u  v  w  0.5 Harker sections consistent with space group P212121, the position of the heavy ion in the asymmetric unit with fractional coordinates of (x, y, z)  (0.318, 0.127, 0.088) was localized. No more peaks were found with a real space Patterson search using the CCP4 suite. The gold ion position was re®ned against the four data sets and phases were computed with MLPHARE (CCP4, 1994) using the MIR-like method (Ramakrishnan et al., 1998) and considering L2 as the pseudo-native data set; hence, for the latter only anomalous occupancies were taken into account for phase calculations. The best statistics were obtained using the L1, L2 and L3 anomalous data. The calculated phases, with an overall ®gure of merit Ê (FOM) of 0.35 for data for the resolution range 20 AÊ 2.5 A, were improved by applying density modi®cation (DM) restraints, with DM from the CCP4 suite. DM was Ê applied to an initial resolution up to 2.8 A and then

Structure of PhoB Receiver Domain extended to the whole data, yielding a substantial increase of the FOM until 0.826. The unbiased ®rst FourÊ ier map, calculated at 2.5 A using the DM phases, showed clear secondary structure features, such as the a-helices and part of the central b-sheet, in agreement with the predicted (a/b)5 folding for the two-component signal transduction response regulators. A bones map was calculated from this density and a single PhoB molecule (molecule A) was built into this map on a Silicon Graphics workstation employing TURBO-Frodo (Roussel & Cambillau, 1989). Clearly de®ned side-chains were also included in this ®rst model. Once molecule A was built, it was copied to match the bones coordinates corresponding to the second molecule in the asymmetric unit (molecule B). Refinement Subsequent re®nement cycles of the model against Ê 8275 observed re¯ections up to 2.5 A resolution were È done with XPLOR (Brunger, 1992) using non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints. Initially, two kinds of maps were calculated with the CCP4 suite: NCS-averaged 2Fobs À Fcalc maps using masks created with RAVE (Jones, 1992) around each molecule, and 2Fobs À Fcalc maps calculated with combined phases coming from the partial structure and the DM procedure; with them, visual inspection and interactive correction of the model was done with TURBO-Frodo. The most dif®cult part to re®ne was loop b3a3 and helix a4 both in molecule B. In this model, the Au ion is coordinated to Cys19 in molecule B, where a continuous density is observed between the cysteine side-chain and the heavy ion site. Both Glu31 and the side-chain of Arg70, from a molecule A type symmetry-related molecule, are in close proximity to the ion site. Upon completion of the model, the better de®ned molecule A was used to solve the native high-resolution structure by molecular replacement. A two-body search with AMoRe (Navaza, 1994), using Ê Ê data between 15 A and 3.5 A resolution, gave clear solutions for the rotation and translation functions, yielding a correlation factor of 54.7 and an R-factor of 40.8, after rigid body re®nement. The positional re®nement continued with XPLOR and SHELX (Sheldrick, 1990) setting aside 10 % of the re¯ections for the R-free calculations, and using NCS restraints. Bulk solvent correction was applied. These re®nement cycles were alternated with interactive inspection and correction of the model. The NCS restraints were reduced, and ®nally not used when the R values were not improving. After a few cycles of positional re®nement without NCS restraints the free Ê R-factor dropped from 40.6 to 35.9 with data up to 1.9 A resolution. The differences in several helical and loop areas between the two molecules were obvious (see Results and Discussion) and justify the absence of NCS restraints in the last cycles of re®nement. This was continued with XPLOR, including restrained individual B-factor re®nement, and model building. Water molecules were added at stereochemically reasonable positions. The same areas of molecule B that showed weak density in the initial MAD map were also ambiguous in the native maps at high resolution. The ®nal model has high temperature factors in these zones and some residues (B57, B58, B86) could not be modeled. These areas have an intrinsic ¯exibility that is probably related to the function of the protein (see Results and Discussion). In molecule A, however, no disorder is observed in these areas, although the temperature factors are above average. The ®rst and the last four residues of
