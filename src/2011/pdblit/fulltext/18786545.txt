We report the complete nucleotide sequence of the single-stranded RNA phage PP7 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There are three open reading frames which code for apparent protein homologues of the single-stranded RNA coliphages, i.e., maturation protein, coat protein, and replicase. A fourth overlapping reading frame exists that probably encodes a lysis protein, similar to what has been found in the group A coliphages such as MS2. The genetic map of PP7 is colinear with group A coliphages and we accordingly classify the phage as a levivirus..There is, generally speaking, no significant nucleotide sequence identity between PP7 and the coliphages except for a few regions where homologous parts of proteins are encoded, most notable in the replicase gene. In these regions the nucleotide sequence similarity between PP7 and MS2 is no greater than between PP7 and the group B coliphages such as Q~. Surprisingly, Qfl and MS2 are no closer to each other than they are to PP7. Several regulatory RNA secondary structure features that are present in the coliphages were identified also in PP7 RNA although the sequences involved cannot be aligned. Among these are the coat protein binding helix at the start of the replicase gene, structures at the 5' and 3' terminus of the RNA, a replicase binding site, and the structure of the coat protein cistron start. Some of these features resemble MS2 type coliphages but others the Qfl type. These findings suggest that PP7 is related to the coliphages but branched off before the coliphages diverged into
separate groups.

INTRODUCTION The single-stranded RNA bacteriophages infect a w i d e range of Gram-negative bacteria, provided they express the proper F- or polar pill on their surface. Initially, these phages were discovered in Escherichia coil by Loeb and Zinder, but soon after similar creatures were found in 0aulobacter and Pseudomonas (for a review see Zinder, 1975). Based on different physical and serological properties of a large number of isolates from different ecological niches in numerous countries, the single-stranded RNA coliphages have been divided into four groups (I to IV). Groups I and II with MS2 and GA as the type species show relatively small differences among each other and are collectively called group A. Similarly, groups Ill and IV with Q~ and SP as best known representatives are similar and together form group B (Furuse, 1987). Genetic maps of MS2 and Q/~ are s h o w n in Fig. 1. Their basic difference is the presence of a readthrough coat protein in group B, w h i c h gets incorporated into the virion and is necessary for infection, Group A phages, on the other

hand, have a separate gene for the lysis function while in group B the maturation protein can cause cell lysis (for a review see van Duin, 1988). The RNA phages of Caulobacter and Pseudomonas have not been examined in much detail. They have the same size and icosahedral structure as their E. coil counterparts. The P s e u d o m o n a s aeruginosa phage PP7 was isolated by Bradley (1966). While the coliphages adsorb to F pill (Crawford and Gesteland, 1964), PP7 is not male · specific and does not attach to the Pseudomonas sex factor FP pilus, but instead adsorbs on the sides of polar pill (Bradley, 1972), w h i c h are crucial for virulence. The diameter of these pill is only 5.2 nm compared to 9 nm for the E. coil F pilus (review Paranchych and Frost, 1988), The other RNA phage isolated from Pseudomonas, PRR1, adsorbs to different pill. PRR1 infects a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria harboring the promiscuous Ptype drug resistance plasmid by adsorbing to the plasmid-encoded pilus. The amino acid sequences of the coat proteins of PRR1 and PP7 were determined and they s h o w e d relatedness to those of MS2 and Q~ (Dhaese et aL, 1979, 1980; G o l m o h a m m a d i e t a L , 1993). In contrast, the coliphages have been the subject of extensive studies. In particular, the availability of Q9 RNA replicase in pure, well-characterized form has allowed a thorough in vitro analysis of kinetics, template require-

OLSTHOORN ET AL. After cell lysis the lysate was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and CsCI centrifugation as described (Voorma et a/., 1971), except that freon extraction was omitted. PP7 RNAwas isolated bytwo successive phenol extractions followed by alcohol precipitation.

ment, specificity, and binding sites of the enzyme (Biebricher and Luce, 1993 and references therein; Axelrod et aL, 1991; Barrera et aL, 1993). MS2 RNA has served as a model system to unravel translational control mechanisms (Berkhout et aL, 1987; Adhin and van Duin, 1990; van Himbergen et aL, 1993). It was a surprise to find that most of this regulation could be explained by the interplay of ribosome movement and the dissolution and reformation of base-paired regions. Clearly, if one is to understand the molecular biology of RNA phages, and of RNA viruses in general, one needs to know the RNA secondary structure. Accordingly, we and others have begun to expand the structural analysis to regions not directly implicated in ribosome binding (Skripkin et al., 1990; Adhin eta/., 1990b; Skripkin and Jacobson, 1993). The sequences of five coliphages have been published (Fiers et al., 1976; Mekler, 1981; Inokuchi et aL, 1986, 1988; Adhin eta/., 1990a) and the sequence of six others has been determined in Leiden but not yet reported. Based on such information phylogenetically supported models for the coliphages are emerging and it becomes desirable to have a reference frame to compare the E. coil phages with. This is one reason why we determined the complete sequence of PP7. We wanted to know whether features of the structure conserved among the coliphages are also maintained in the Pseudomonas phages, i.e., is there an archaetype structure for all RNA phages? Furthermore, since PP7 lives in a host with a high G + C content in its chromosome, one could ask if this nucleotide bias is reflected in the resident RNA phages. A second reason for investigating PP7 was that it has an "extra" protein in its virion. Dhaese (1979) prepared a fingerprint of this protein, p25, which suggested that it has the same amino terminal sequence as the coat protein which has a molecular weight of 13,874 Da. It could not be a coat read-through protein analogous to that of group B phages since PP7 RNA has no space for an inframe read-through product even if it were only a moderate fraction of the size found in Q~. Because of our in vitro study on MS2 translation products which arose by frameshifting near the end of the coat (and replicase) gene(s), it was attractive to think that PP7 may package an equivalent protein. MATERIALS AND METHODS Virus and RNA isolation PP7 phage was obtained from P. Dhaese and M. van Montagu (University of Ghent, Belgium) and its host P. aeruginosa was a gift from B. Holloway (Monash University, Australia). P. aeruginosa PA01 (Holloway, 1969)was infected with a fresh lysate of PP7 phage at conditions similar to amplification of coliphages (Adhin et aL, 1990a).

Regions 1-3300. cDNA clones covering the regions 1-960, 390-2570, 1900-3000, and 2240-3300 were obtained as follows. 12 pmol of PP7 RNA and 30 pmol of random hexamers were heated for 1 min at 42 ° in a 20#1 reaction mixture containing 20 mM DTE, 0.5 mM dNTP, 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.3), 40 mM KCI, and 8 mM MgCI2. First strand synthesis was started by addition of 16 units M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (Pharmacia). After 10 min at room temperature the reaction was continued at 30 ° for an additional 10 min and concluded for 3.5 hr at 42 °. The R N A - c D N A hybrid was purified by two phenol/ chloroform extractions, passage through a 1-ml Sephadex G25-column, and ethanol precipitation. The R N A cDNA hybrid was tailed with dCTP by terminal transferase (Bethesda Research Laboratories) and subsequently annealed to an oligo(dG)-tailed pUC9 vector (Pharmacia) as described earlier (Adhin et aL, 1990a). JM101 was transformed with the annealing mixture and clones with inserts were selected for further analysis by restriction mapping followed by subcloning into M13mp18 and M13mp19. Region 3216-3588 (3' end). The tight RNA secondary structure at the 3' end of several coliphages (Adhin et aL, 1990a) can make cloning difficult. We proceeded as follows. RNA (30 pmol) in 10 #1 distilled H20 was heated at 60 ° for 5 min and then rapidly chilled in ice. Poly(A) buffer (final concentration 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.9), 250 mM NaCi, 10 mM MgCI2, 6.5 mM MnCI2, 50 fig bovine serum albumin), ATP (125 #M), 2 units RNasin (Promega), and 5 units poly(A) polymerase (BRL) were added and the mixture incubated at 37 ° for 30 min. The A-tailed RNA was purified as described for the R N A - c D N A hybrid. cDNA synthesis was performed as described above except that 18 units AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) were used and first strand synthesis was initiated with either oligo DUI416 (5' dqqq-lq-G(G/O)AT(O/G)Oq-Tq-q~Tlqqqq-GGG 3') or oligo DUI570 (5' dT20GG 3'). DUI416 was specially designed for cloning 3' ends of coliphages as they terminate with the conserved -CCCA sequence. However, attempts to clone the 3' end of PP7 with this primer were unsuccessful since DUI416 tended to hybridize with a stretch of C-residues around position 3353. Therefore we used a primer with two Gs at the 3' end (DU1570). It turned out that PP7 RNA ends with -ACCA, which explained our failures with DUI416.

SEQUENCE OF RNA PHAGE PP7 FROM Pseudomonas The cDNA obtained with DUI570 was amplified by PCR using a second primer (DUI503) homologous to bases 3216 to 3241 and 1.5 units Taq polymerase (Promega). The resulting PCR product was tailed with dCTP and cloned into. pU.C9 as described above. These experiments produced four clones covering the remaining 3' end. For sequencing purposes some clones were shortened by deleting a Sail-fragment. A Sail-site is present in PP7 at position 3334 and also in pUC9. Sequencing The regions 1-450 and 2240-3300 were sequenced as follows. Restriction fragments of 200-300 bp were subcloned into M13 vectors and sequenced in both directions. Clones covering the regions 390-2570 and 3216-3588 were directly sequenced by the supercoil sequencing procedure (Chen and Seeburg, 1985). The sequence of both strands was determined using plus and minus strand-specific primers. DNA sequencing was carried out by the chain termination method (Sanger et aL, 1977) using the T7 sequencing kit (Pharmacia). The number of G-residues at the 5' end of PP7 could not be determined because of the G-tail derived from the cDNA cloning procedure. For this reason reverse transcription of the RNA using a primer complementary to bases 43-62 (DUI600) was applied to solve this problem. The conditions for the reverse transcription were as described earlier (Skripkin et aL, 1990) except that the dNTP concentration was 10 times higher and the chase reaction and ethanol precipitation were omitted. Nucleotides 1182, 1360, and 2050 could not be identified by DNA sequencing. The identity of position 1360 was crucial for determining the stop-codon of the maturation gene. By reverse transcription of the RNA with a primer complementary to 1444-1466 (DUI812) two bases were found. An identical result was obtained when the reaction was performed with dlTP instead of dGTP to minimize band compression in the gel. Nucleotide 1182 was clarified by sequencing the first strand of cDNA obtained in the previously mentioned reaction with DUI 812. The cDNA was treated with RNAse to remove the RNA template and after phenol/choroform extraction the cDNA was purified over a G25 column to remove all nucleotides which could interfere with the sequencing. Sequencing was carried out with AMV reverse transcriptase at 55° and a primer DUI 811 homologous to 1140-1165 under the same conditions as for reverse transcription of the RNA. For nucleotide 2050 all the afore mentioned methods were tried but failed; since Avail did not cut here we know it must be either a G, A, or U (symbol "D"). The complete sequence has been deposited with GenBank, Accession No. X80191.

consin, release 7.3 (Devereux et aL, 1984). Alignments were carried out with the PILEUP program. Homology percentages were determined with the GAP program which uses the Needleman and Wunsch algorithm. Secondary structure predictions were made by the FOLD program (Zuker and Stiegler, 1981) and by eye.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Genome organization
PP7 RNA is 3588 nucleotides long; this size is similar to the group I phages such as MS2 and fr which are 3569 and 3575 nucleotides long, respectively. There are at least three, and probably four, open reading frames in the sequence and their positions are given in Fig. 1. Based on protein homology with the coliphages (see below), the size of the maturation protein from virions (not shown), and the products of cell free protein synthesis (Davies and Benike, 1974), we have designated these genes as maturation, coat, and replicase. We also propose that a small overlapping reading frame encodes the lysis function. The map resembles that of the group I coliphages. One difference is the 100 bases longer maturation protein gene, which results partly from a displaced stop codon overlapping the start of the coat protein gene. We do not think the overlap has any regulatory consequences. The maturation gene is translated with very low frequency and coat protein expression is independent of it in the coliphages. Furthermore, we have made several mutant MS2 phages in which the maturation reading frame was extended to overlap that of the coat gene by some 10 nucreotides. Such mutants were viable and they had a titer that was close to that of wild type (Olsthoorn and van Duin, unpublished observations).

Protein sequences
Maturation protein. The maturation protein probably occurs at one copy per virion and has two known functions. It matures the virus particle by preventing the RNA from dangling out of the virion, thereby conferring protection against RNase, and it is necessary for infection. Upon contact with the host's pill the maturation protein is cleaved leading to release of the RNA (Zinder, 1975). in Q/~ and presumably in other group B phages the maturation protein also possesses a lysis function (Karnik and Billeter, 1983; Winter and Gold, 1983). Although unlikely (see below), we cannot exclude the possibility that the PP7 maturation protein causes cell lysis. Its homology to the group B and group A counterparts is equally low (--20%), which is not surprising since PP7 adsorbs to different pill. Nevertheless, when the proteins are aligned three stretches of significant homology are found (boxed in Fig. 2). The C-terminal one was pre-

viously identified by Mekler (1981) as homologous between MS2 and Q~. The other two domains, which are rich in aromatic residues, have not been identified before and have no counterparts in other proteins, as revealed by a FASTA search of the Swiss protein bank. Coat protein. The coat proteins of all single-stranded RNA phages are remarkably uniform in size (Fig. 3). With 127 amino acids (methionine is cleaved off) PP7 contains the shortest version so far. Our sequence differs at five contiguous positions from the one published by Dhaese et al. (1980). In that report, residues 111-115 are mentioned as VQATS. This seems a scrambled version of the RNA predicted sequence ATSQV. We believe that the RNA-derived sequence is correct. When homologies are scored we note that the PP7 coat protein is about equally distant from group A and B counterparts with a slightly better fit with the group A proteins (Table 1). At the nucleotide level PP7 is equidistant to all four coliphages in the coat gene (Table 1). Still, A and B coliphages show somewhat better protein homology with each other than with PP7. A recent evaluation of the coat proteins of RNA phages has been published by Golmohammadi et aL (1993). p25 protein. Tryptic fingerprint analysis showed that p25 and the coat protein are related (Dhaese, 1979). Using p25 that was gel purified three times, we found that it has the same N-terminal amino acid sequence as coat protein. As judged by SDS-PAGE, p25 has an apparent molecular weight 12 kDa larger than coat protein. From the RNA sequence, readthrough of the coat protein gene terminator would give an extension of 8 amino acids, whereas a - 1 or +1 frameshift just prior to the coat gene terminator would give extensions of 16 or 45 amino acids, respectively. Either of the putative frameshift proteins upon tryptic digestion would yield C-terminal peptides with molecular weights of 3 - 4 kDa absent from digested coat protein, but no such peptides were found

(data not shown). Analysis with the protease Asp-N, which cleaves at the amino terminal side of aspartate residues, also yielded data inconsistent with a frameshift model for p25 (Garde and Dayhuff, unpublished observations). Different PP7 phage preparations, grown and purified through two cesium chloride gradients, were variably pigmented red, despite the use of the same inoculum. When samples of these preparations were fractionated on SDS-PAGE, they showed differing amounts of the minor virion protein p25, varying from 1 to 10 molecules per virion (as measured against the maturation protein, which is present in coliphages at one molecule per vidon). The phage preparations with the most p25 corresponded to those with the deepest red color, implicating p25 as the source of red pigment. Furthermore, when enough purified phage is loaded on SDS-PAGE, the p25 protein is visible as a dark red or brown band as it migrates through the gel (data not shown). Although small bits of identity exist between the cysteine domain of PP7 coat protein and that of some nonheme iron-sulfur proteins, spectroscopic analysis reveals that any possible contribution of iron-sulfur bridges occurs at less than a few percent (Dayhuff, unpublished observations). Our current explanation for p25 is a nondirected collision of heme with coat protein leading to a thioester linkage to cysteine stabilized by formation of a second thioester linkage to a nearby cysteine (cysteine is at positions 67 and 72). When this hemocoat protein is assembled into a growing virion one of the thioester linkages shifts from an intramolecular bond to an intermolecular bond creating a coat dimer. This model is supported by substantial but incomplete evidence (Dayhuff, unpublished observations). Previously it was noted that MS2 phage with defined coat protein mutants yielded an extra band on S D S PAGE which was most likely due to a small proportion

of stable coat protein dimers (see Fig. 6W in Peabody, 1989). Lysis protein. The putative lysis (L) gene is in the same place as its MS2 counterpart, i.e., starting near the end of the coat protein gene in the + 1 frame with respect to the coat gene, extending through the intercistronic region, and overlapping the 5' region of the replicase gene. Like its MS2 counterpart (Atkins et al., 1979b; Beremand and Blumenthal, 1979; Coleman etaL, 1983), the putative PP7 L protein has a positively charged N-terminal part followed by 30 mainly hydrophebic residues at the Cterminus. This composition is characteristic of the L proteins of bacteriophages. The hydrophobic domain is

thought to cross the cytoplasmic membrane and to shortcircuit its electric potential (reviewed recently by Young, 1993). The interaction with the membrane can apparently be achieved by a variety of hydrophobic amino acids since strong homologies have not turned up when comparing the sequences of all known RNA phage L proteins (our unpublished observations). Although the PP7 lysis protein wTth its 54 amino acids seems small compared to the 75 amino acids for the MS2 counterpart, it is known that truncated versions of the MS2 L protein are still functional as long as they retain their C-terminal 30 residues (Berkhout et aL, 1985; Goessens et al., 1988). The start codon of the PP7 L gene is UUG. This is an

unusual initiator triplet; however, this codon is also used for the L genes in phage fr and KU1, a recently sequenced group II phage. In this last phage the L protein is also short, i.e., 64 amino acids (Groeneveld and van Duin, submitted for publication). Replicase. Extensive studies with Q~ indicated that the phage-encoded component of the RNA replicase forms a complex with EF-Tu and EF-Ts to build the active enzyme and that two additional host factors are required to produce the minus strand from the plus strand. These are ribosomal protein $1 and the product of the recently cloned hfq gene (HF1) (see Kajitani et a/., 1994). Despite its interaction with Pseudomonas rather than E. coil components, the replicase is the most conserved of the phage proteins. In particular, there is a large region in the center of the protein with extensive homology. In Fig. 4 this part is shown in brackets and conserved residues are in bold face. The degree of similarity in this region between bacteriophages is presented in Table 2 and basically shows the equidistance between PP7 and the various coliphages. The YGDD motif, which is so far universally conserved among all RNA-dependent RNA replicases, occurs at position 338 (Kamer and Argos, 1984). Other strongly conserved residues between the coliphages and PP7 are the IDLN (1), DLS.ASD (2), MGNG (3), and FRESCG (4) motifs at position 230, 255, 304, and 374, respectively. Motifs 2, 3, and 4 have also been identified in other RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRPS), although in somewhat different forms (Poch et aL, 1989; .Bruenn, 1991). Motif 1, which is also present in the recently se-

quenced coliphages MX1, M l l , and NL95 (Beekwilder, Nieuwenhuizen, and van Duin, submitted for publication) has not been found in other RDRPS. We do find strong homology with a region just upstream of the YGDD motif in polio-, coxsackie-, and human rhinoviruses which are closely related to the leviviruses (Bruenn, 1991). Conserved RNA secondary structures The stable 5' terminal hairpin. All coliphages have a stable stem structure closed by a tetraloop at their 5' ends. PP7 RNA has the same feature as is shown in Fig. 5, where its 5' terminal hairpin is compared to that of MS2, Qa, and M l l . The upper part of the stem always contains straight C.G pairs. The lower half is generally weaker by the presence of a bulge, a mismatch, G.U pairs, or a combination thereof. We speculate that this hairpin at the terminus is important to ensure that the emerging nascent plus strand folds back on itself and does not anneal with the template strand. In this context it is probably significant that the loop sequence of the 5' terminal hairpin in both MS2 and .Mll is the complement of the tetraloops 5'GAAA and 5'UACG, respectively, which are known to confer increased hairpin stabilities (Heus and Pardi, 1991; Tuerk et aL, 1988). (The tetraloop sequences in PP7 and Q~ have not been examined in this respect.) This design then will promote intramolecular folding of the minus strand. The lower stability at the bottom part of the stem is believed to facilitate access of the replicase when plus strand synthesis has to start. Note that the G.U pairs will be C.A mismatches in the minus strand. Interestingly, similar, rather stable, hairpins have been found at the ends of artificial Q# replicase templates (see also Biebricher and Luce, 1993). The strong 5' terminal hairpin makes it difficult to clone and sequence this part of the chain. Reverse transcriptase shows a strong stop some five nucleotides before the loop and transcripts through the loop show anomalous mobilities even under strong denaturing conditions. Coat gene start. This part of the phage has been well studied in MS2 where the RNA folding has been

determined by structure probing, comparative analysis, and translation predictability of mutant genotypes (Skripkin et el., 1990; de Smit and van Duin, 1990). In Fig. 6 we compare the secondary structure of PP7 for this region with that of Q~ and with fr, e group I phage with high homology to MS2 (Adhin etaL, 1990a). Of all known group A phages, the fr structure shows most similarity with PP7, in particular the middle s t e m - l o o p which contains the coat gene start codon. Both PP7

and fr have a large internal loop, where MS2 only has a mismatch. The maturation protein gene is terminated by a small hairpin that is conserved in all coliphages (Fig. 6). It contains the stop coder] for the maturation protein, but its function is not known. As shown in Fig. 6, this s t e m loop structure is conserved in PP7, but it does not contain the stop codon, which is located further downstream, in overlap with the coat start. We have noted that the PP7

hairpin carries two nonsense triplets, but repeated sequencing in the 3' terminal region of the maturation gene did not provide any evidence that any of these codons were in frame. The coat initiator hairpin of MS2 RNA has been the subject of extensive research, which has revealed that ribosomes do not initiate by recognizing this helix. Rather, they bind to this RNA sequence when unfolded by thermal motion. It was found that the A G ° of the hairpin is set at a value that just allows maximal ribosome loading (de Smit and van Duin, 1994). Evolutionary studies on disrupted initiator hairpins in phage MS2 have indeed shown that selection pressure operates neither on the exact shape of the hairpin nor on the sequence, but solely on the AG ° of the structure (Olsthoorn eta/., 1994). We suppose that the PP7 stem-loop structure serves a similar purpose. The second coat gene hairpin is also conserved in PP7. On its 3' side we find in both phages a small region of sequence identity (underlined) that can serve as reference point to align the structures. We note that small hairpins are found preferentially at the beginning of the coat and replicase genes and their presence seems a way to combine secondary structure

are shown are confirmed by structure probing and by phylogenetic comparison and they strongly resemble the structures present in PP7 and fr. Due to lack of sequence variation there is no certainty about the position of the initiator stem-loop in Q~. Two possible loop positions are indicated by slashes or dots (see also Skripkin and Jacobson, 1993). Repficase start. In the group A phages the replicase gene is preceded by the coat gene, while in the group B phages it is adjacent to the readthrough gene (Fig. 1). For this reason some differences in RNA structure between groups A and B exist at this point. In Fig. 7 we compare the secondary structure of MS2, PP7, and Qa at the start of the replicase cistron. The coat (readthrough) terminator hairpins are remarkably similar in all phages, in particular the conspicuous presence of the mismatch in the middle of the stem and the stop codon in or close to the loop. MS2 and PP7 have the contiguous G.C pairs in the lower part of the stem in common. Another striking similarity between these two phages is the nucleotide stretch between terminator and replicase initiator stem. In group A this stretch pairs with an internal segment of the coat coding region to form a long-distance interaction that is responsible for the translational coupling between coat and replicase genes in MS2 (Min Jou etaL, 1972; van Himbergen eta/., 1993). For PP7 we tentatively propose a similar interaction here. Obviously, in Q/~ an equivalent interaction at this region is not possible, but Skripkin and Jacobson (1993) have proposed other regions of complementarity between the coat coding sequence and the vicinity of the replicase start to explain the translational polarity that was also shown to exist in this phage for these two genes. The most interesting structure, however, in this region is the hairpin that contains the start codon of the repli-

case gene. In the coliphages this hairpin fulfills a key regulatory function. It can bind a coat protein dimer with high affinity, thereby preventing further replicase synthesis. This RNA-protein complex is also a first step in capsid formation (Witherell eta/., 1991). In the coliphages the position of the bulged A, the identity of the loop nucleotides, and the number of base pairs in the stem are important for recognition by the coat protein (Witherell et al., 1991). MS2 and Q/~ have solved this repression problem in different ways. In MS2 the start codon is placed on the right side of the stem, whereas Q~ has it at the left side. In addition, the distance of the bulge from the loop and the sequences in the loop are different in both phages. PP7 provides another solution; the replicase start is positioned at the top in a hexanucleotide loop. The bulged A is placed as in the coliphages on the 5' side of the stem and as in Q~ it occurs after the fourth pair from the top. On the other hand the identity of the bulge nucleotide is the same in PP7 and MS2, i.e., it is the A ofthe Shine-Dalgarno region. A final point of interest concerns the differential stabilities of the terminator and initiator hairpins, specifically in MS2 and PP7. In PP7 these values are - 1 9 and - 6 kcal/mol, respectively. The much lower stability of the start helix is consistent with the finding that ribosomes are generally less able to initiate at structures with a stability stronger than approximately - 7 kcal/mol (de Smit, 1994; Kubo et aL, 1990). Note that the structure depicted for MS2 ( - 3 kcal/mol) is weak enough to allow unlimited initiation in the absence of the coat protein and the long-distance interaction (Berkhout, 1986). The 3' untranslated region. The length of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) varies in different phages= In group I it contains some 175 nts, whereas in the other three groups this number is close to 100. PP7 has the

FIG. 8. Structure of the 3' untranslated region of PP7 and Q/~.The replicase stop codon and the conserved sequence in the loop of helix 1 are boxed. The Q/~structure is supported by comparative analysis with about 10 other sequences (Adhin et aL, 1990b; Beekwilder, Nieuwenhuizen,and van Duin, submitted for publication). shortest 3' UTR with 81 nucleotides. The extra length of MS2 and fr is accounted for by the presence of three to four extra stem-loop structures as compared to the other groups (Adhin etaL, 1990b). The 3' UTR of the coliphages folds into a separate domain bounded by a long-distance interaction between the last six nucleotides of the RNA and its complement present just downstream of the replicase terminator hairpin (Fig. 8). PP7 has a 3' domain structure most resembling that of group Ill phages, from which helix 2 is absent. Specific similarities between PP7 and Q~ are stem-loop V1 with four base pairs and a tetraloop. These two features are also found in five other group Ill phages for which the sequence in this part is known. Hairpin V2 is a general feature of all coliphages and has a characteristic large loop usually rich in A residues. This hairpin contains the binding sites for ribosomal protein $1 and host factor (HFI) as well as for the maturation protein (Goelz and Steitz, 1977; Senear and Steitz, 1976; Shiba and Suzuki, 1981; Adhin etaL, 1990b). Hairpin 1 is present in all coliphages and it may have significance that the conserved loop sequence UGCUU is also present in PP7 albeit in the slightly changed form OGCUC. The domain closing interaction in PP7 is only three vs six pairs in the other phages. We also note that PP7 has only two C residues at its 3' end. This property is matched bythe double G's atthe 5' end (Fig. 2). Because of the high resemblance with the Q~ structure we think our proposal for the PP7 3' domain is realistic.

The coding regions. Of all proteins encoded in the RNA phages, the replicases show the largest similarity and nucleotide alignments between replicase genes are rather successful in regions where protein homology exists. In principle such homology would allow one to examine if RNA secondary structure is also conserved in the coding regions. Though this is an extensive project, that falls outside the scope of this paper, we provide two examples of a local analysis that will probably turn out to be representative for large parts of the complete molecule. One example shows how the RNA is folded around the motif YGDD, universally conserved in all RNA-dependent RNA replicases examined thus far. The.nucleotide sequences around this motif can be aligned in all RNA bacteriophages. Comparative analysis supported by structure probing has enabled us to show the conservation of the folding of this region in A and B type coilphages and we can now compare these structures with PP7 (Fig. 9). Surprisingly, all coliphages form a hairpin with this sequence that shows overall similarity, but is different in detail. It is remarkable that even in PP7 a similar hairpin can form at virtually the same position in the RNA. However, among all these phages the sequence is used in a progressively shifted way. In Qp the second aspartic acid codon is 4 nt away from the center of the loop, in MS2 this distance is two, in MXl one nucleotide, while finally in PP7 the distance is zero. One can also visualize the gradual changes affecting this helix by focusing on the first isoleucine codon. This triplet

lies on the left side of the helix in Qp but going to the other phages one sees a progressive shift in position until this codon ends up at the 3' side of the stem-loop structure in PP7. This flexibility in how to use different parts of aligned sequences to build a common RNA structure is a general feature in the RNA phages and frequently limits the information one can extract from alignments by conventional computer programs. The second example is more extreme and concerns a hairpin centered around position 2812 in Q~ RNA, which is part of the internally located replicase binding site, the M2b site (Meyer et al., 1981). The amino acids in this hairpin are centered around PP7 number 130 in the alignment of Fig. 4 and homology between all proteins is evident. The corresponding stem-loop structures for Q~, MS2, and PP7 are shown in Fig. 10. Both the MS2 and Q# structures are supported by structure probing and phylogenetic comparison (Skripkin etaL, 1990; Skripkin and Jacobsen, 1993). In MS2 the hairpin is formed from a different part of the aligned sequences than in Q~, but PP7 conforms rather well to the Q~ structure with the common GGA protein motif on the 3' side of the helix. In a more extreme way, this example shows that, although several hairpins in coding regions can be shown to be conserved, they do not necessarily occupy an identical position in the aligned sequences in the different phage groups. More work is needed to determine if such shifts are corrected elsewhere in the chain, so as to bring the different foldings back into register with the alignment. Replicase binding sites. When Q# replicase is incubated with Q/~ RNA to form a preinitiation complex, two internal regions are protected against RNase. One of these, the S-site, overlaps the ribosome binding site of the coat protein gene. The other one, the M-region, consists of three noncontiguous fragments, M5, M2b, and

M l l (Meyer et al., 1981). The M2b region is about 180 nucleotides long and at least part of its secondary structure is conserved in all four coliphages (Skripkin et al., 1990; Skripkin and Jacobsen, 1993). We therefore examined its potential preservation in PP7. Its global position in the sequence could be inferred from the amino acid alignment of Fig. 4, where the M2b site is found around position 110. In Fig. 11 we present the existing base pairing models for SP and MS2 for a characteristic substructure of the M2b region. These models are supported by comparative evidence and structure probing (Skripkin et al., 1990; Skripkin and Jacobsen, 1993; Beekwilder and van Duin, unpublished observations). We note that the West stemloop structure of the MS2 cloverleaf has been replaced

FIG. 11. RNA secondary structure at a substructure of the M2b replicase binding site. Amino acids that afign quite well in the structures of SP and PP7 are circled. SP is chosen rather than Q~ because the protein homology between SP and PP7 is clearer for this part of the sequence.The three hairpins are referred to as East, South, and West, respectively. by a hexanucleotide in SP. Another relevant feature is the large loop in the Southern hairpin and a short one in the East arm in MS2, while these characteristics are reversed in SP. Our tentative proposal for PP7's equivalent of the M2b substructure shows good overall similarity with the coilphages, except that the East and South arms are substantially shorter. Further comparison reveals that PP7 shows more likeness to SP than to MS2. There is the replacement of the West arm by seven nucleotides and also the sizes of the loops in the two remaining helices conform those of SP, in particular the large pyrimidinerich loop in the East helix. Similarly, there is an abundance of G and C residues in the Southern stem, in particular at the 3' side. The regular computer program FOLD only predicts the South arm of PP7, but when the energy parameters are slightly changed the East arm also appears. We also feel that the structure as we present it here is supported by the equivalent position of the string of aligned nucleotides encoding the amino acids K, I, and L in both SP and PP7 (Fig. 11). The helix that we showed above in Fig. 10 is also part of the M2b site and it is quite suggestive that also in that example PP7 folds like group B rather than like group A. Codon usage and base composition In the coliphages codon choice in the coat gene closely follows that used by the host for highly expressed genes, while this preference tends to be random in the maturation and replicase genes. With the aid of the codon preference table of West and Iglewski (1988) we have compared codon usage in the three major genes of PP7 with that of its host. With a few exceptions codon choice in the coat gene corresponds well to that of the host, while this preference is almost absent for the maturation and replicase genes. For instance, notoriously rare codons in Pseudomonas are absent from the coat gene, which is expected for a highly expressed gene, but these codons are not avoided in the maturation and repliease cistrons. An exception to the rule that the coat gene follows the codon bias of the host is the high frequency with which codons ending in U are used at the expense of those ending in C. For

example, in the PP7 coat gene, 31% of all ACN codons are ACU, while this number is only 3% in Pseudomonas genes; for the CUN vs CUU codon these numbers are 27 and 2%, respectively. Presumably, these U ending codons are avoided in the host to satisfy the GO drift of the Pseudomonad genome, which contains 67% G+C (Palleroni, 1984). Since synonymous codons ending in U or C are generally read by the same tRNA, an adverse effect on translation by using XYU instead of XYC is not likely. In this context we note that PP7, containing 54% of G-t-C, has not adopted the base composition of the host. The evolutionary disadvantage here may be too strong a secondary structure. Consistent with this idea is that the G+O content of PP7 is only slightly higher than that of the coliphages which varies between 46 and 52% G+C.

such as translational start sites, the 5' and 3' untranslated sequences, as well as a replicase binding area. However, also in regular coding regions, only two examples of which have been presented in this paper (Figs. 9 and 10), structure homology can be identified. The diversity in genotypes seems of little concern to the phages as long as it leads to a conserved phenotype, i.e., secondary structure. In time it may become clear that, like other RNA species such as tRNA and ribosomal RNA, also the RNA phages possess a universally conserved ground structure.

CONCLUSIONS Relatedness of PP7 to RNA coliphages
We have determined the sequence of the singlestranded RNA phage PP7 which grows in P. aeruginosa and have used this information for a molecular comparison with the RNA coliphages. The analysis shows that PP7 resembles the group I coliphages like MS2 in genome length and in genetic organization. Judged by sequence homology, however, PP7 is as distantly related to MS2 as it is to Q~ (Table 2). Despite the genetic closeness of PP7 to MS2 some features are more similar to Q9 type phages. For instance, the 3' untranslated region of PP7 is much shorter than that of MS2 and close to the size of Q~. Interestingly, also the folding of this region resembles that of Q~ and not that of the group A phages. Another point of similarity to Q~ is the structure of the hairpin at the start of the replicase cistron, which constitutes a high affinity coat protein binding site. In both PP7 and Qp the bulged A nucleotide, believed important for protein recognition, is placed 4 bp from the loop, while this distance is only two in MS2. These similarities to both major coliphage groups suggests that PP7 and the coliphages branched off from a common ancestor before groups A and B separated. The possibility that PP7 is the result of horizontal transmission of group I coliphages to Pseudomonas leaves the Q/~ traits of PP7 unexplained.

An archaetype structure for the RNA bacteriophages?
Except for the central portion of the replicase gene, nucleic acid sequence homology between PP7, Q~, and MS2 is close to random. Nevertheless, our search has suggested that a substantial number of RNA structure elements are conserved. These include strategic regions
