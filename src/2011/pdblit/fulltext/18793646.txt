Conformational Change in the Catalytic Site of the Ribonuclease YoeB Toxin by YefM Antitoxin
Katsuhiko Kamada1,* and Fumio Hanaoka1,2 1 Cellular Physiology Laboratory RIKEN Discovery Research Institute 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198 Japan 2 Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences Osaka University 1-3 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871 Japan Genome analysis demonstrates that the E. coli chromosome possesses six independent antitoxin-toxin pairs, which are based on sequence similarities among toxins. One class consists of the MazE-MazF and ChpBI-ChpBK pairs (Masuda et al., 1993), and the second class contains the RelB-RelE, DinJ-YafQ, and YefM-YoeB pairs (Anantharaman and Aravind, 2003; Bech et al., 1985; Grady and Hayes, 2003). The YafNYafO potential addiction module has been suggested to form a third class (Gronlund and Gerdes, 1999). Of these chromosomal toxins, RelE and MazF have been extensively characterized. RelE is a codon-dependent endoribonuclease that is active when it associates with the ribosomal A-site (Christensen and Gerdes, 2003; Pedersen et al., 2003) or, alternatively, acts as a stimulatory factor for the intrinsic endonuclease activity of the ribosome (Hayes and Sauer, 2003). This toxin seems to be involved in quality control of gene expression, like eukaryotic nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. MazF is an ACA sequence specific endoribonuclease which functions independently of the ribosome (Munoz-Gomez et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005). However, some data suggest that MazF behaves like RelE at the ribosomal A-site (Christensen et al., 2003). X-ray crystallography of toxin-antitoxin pairs from two systems, E. coli MazF-MazE (Kamada et al., 2003) and P. horikoshii RelE-RelB (Takagi et al., 2005), have revealed that the components of each toxin-antitoxin complex are dissimilar, both architecturally and in the oligomers they form. The MazF toxin forms a dimer, structurally similar to the Kid (Hargreaves et al., 2002) and CcdB (Loris et al., 1999) plasmid toxins, and these dimers form a heterohexamer with the MazE antitoxin (MazF2-MazE2-MazF2). The MazE antitoxin appears to prevent RNA substrates from accessing the active site of MazF by molecular mimicry using its invariant tryptophan (Zhang et al., 2003). In contrast, the RelE-RelB complex forms a tetramer composed of two heterodimers (RelE-RelB)2. The nonglobular structure of RelB hides the RelE surface where conserved, functionally important arginine residues are clustered (Takagi et al., 2005). The YefM-YoeB antitoxin-toxin module on the E. coli chromosome was originally identified by homology to the Axe (antitoxin)-Txe (toxin) pair of the Enterococcus faecium pRUM multidrug-resistant plasmid (Grady and Hayes, 2003). Similar to components of other addiction modules, the YoeB toxin is a basic protein (10 kDa), whereas the YefM antitoxin is acidic (11 kDa) and structurally unfolded (Cherny and Gazit, 2004). The yefMyoeB cassette functions as a antitoxin-toxin module (Cherny and Gazit, 2004; Grady and Hayes, 2003). YoeB toxin induces cleavage of translated mRNA (Christensen et al., 2004). Moreover, overexpression of Lon, an ATP-dependent protease, specifically activates YoeBdependent mRNA cleavage, indicating that Lon degradation of YefM activates YoeB (Christensen et al., 2004). To understand the relationship between RNase activity of the YoeB toxin and inhibition by the YefM antitoxin, we determined the crystal structures of the E. coli

Summary The eubacterial chromosome encodes various addiction modules that control global levels of translation through RNA degradation. Crystal structures of the Escherichia coli YefM2 (antitoxin)-YoeB (toxin) complex and the free YoeB toxin have been determined. The structure of the heterotrimeric complex reveals an asymmetric disorder-to-order recognition strategy, in which one C terminus of the YefM homodimer exclusively interacts with an atypical microbial ribonuclease (RNase) fold of YoeB. Comparison with the YefM-free YoeB structure indicates a conformational rearrangement of the RNase catalytic site of YoeB, induced by interaction with YefM. Complementary biochemical experiments demonstrate that the YoeB toxin has an in vitro RNase activity that preferentially cleaves at the 3 end of purine ribonucleotides. Introduction Eubacteria and archaea possess genetic elements encoding toxin-antitoxin pairs, known as addiction modules, which were originally proposed to control postsegregational killing, like low-copy plasmid maintenance system (reviewed in Engelberg-Kulka and Glaser, 1999; Gerdes et al., 2005; Hayes, 2003). The mechanism depends on an unstable antitoxin and a stable toxin, both of which are encoded by a single operon. When a plasmid is inherited, the antitoxin neutralizes the toxin by forming a stable complex. Loss of the plasmid accelerates degradation of the structurally unstable antitoxin by host proteases, causing cells to be killed by cytotoxic activity of the toxin. However, recent evidence indicates that the cryptic chromosomal addiction modules function to modulate the global level of translation during nutritional and/or environmental stresses (Christensen et al., 2003; Pedersen et al., 2002), rather than acting as altruistic suicide elements that induce the majority of the population of bacteria to release limited nutrients to enable a small fraction to survive. These addiction modules are also in the spotlight as potential targets for development of alternative antibiotics against nosocomial infections by multidrugresistant bacteria (Engelberg-Kulka et al., 2004; Grady and Hayes, 2003).

YoeB toxin and the YefM-YoeB complex. The structures reveal an atypical microbial RNase fold for YoeB and YefM-induced conformational changes around the putative active site of YoeB. Biochemical analyses and mutagenesis experiments have identified the residues responsible for RNase activity of the toxin. Comparative structural alignment suggests that the atypical RNase fold is present in several toxins.

Results Structure Determinations of the YefM-YoeB Complex and YefM-Free YoeB YefM (Figure 1A) and YoeB (Figure 1B) were coexpressed using two pET vectors and copurified as a stable heterocomplex. The pET plasmid vector containing yoeB derived from the E. coli K-12 strain could not be introduced into B background strains (Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online) due to toxicity of the YoeB protein. Simultaneous introduction of the two pET vectors containing yefM and yoeB allowed the resultant transformants to be viable. These data suggest that the B background strains do not possess a set of cognate toxin-antitoxin genes or that the expression level of the cognate genes of the

BL21 strain is not sufficient to compensate for leaky transcription from the pET vector. Mass spectrometry indicated that the purified recombinant YefM-YoeB complex contained a shorter translated product, amino acids 10­92 of YefM. The lack of sequence similarity of the predicted first nine residues of YefM to any of the related antitoxins (Figure 1A) and the presence of a Shine-Dalgarno (SD)-like sequence in the DNA that is predicted to code for these nine amino acids suggests that the shorter form is functionally equivalent to full-length YefM. Therefore, the truncated form of yefM was reconstructed for structure determinations. The YefM-YoeB complex structure was determined by X-ray diffraction at 2.05 Å resolution via the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion method. The structures of two crystal forms of YefM-free YoeB, from isopropanol and polyethylene glycol (PEG) crystallization conditions, were determined at 1.77 and 2.05 Å resolution, respectively (Table 1 and Experimental Procedures).

The YefM-YoeB Heterotrimeric Complex The YefM-YoeB heterotrimer contains one YoeB and two copies of YefM (Figure 2). Hydrodynamic experiments documented that the solution form of the com-

plex has a molecular weight of about 30 kDa, which corresponds well with the stoichiometry of the trimeric structure. The asymmetric YefM-YoeB heterotrimer is elongated in shape (60 × 35 × 35 Å). The N-terminal segments of the two YefM monomers form a symmetrical dimer (Figure 2, S1­H3 and S1#­H3#, where # denotes the YefM protomer possessing the disordered C terminus). One of the YefM C-terminal segments (H4­ S4) extending from the N-terminal dimer exclusively binds the globular YoeB monomer (Figure 2). The other YefM C terminus is structurally disordered. The total solvent-accessible surface area between the YefM homodimer and YoeB is 3300 Å2. The RNase Fold of YoeB in the Complex YoeB forms a compact globular structure, consisting of a five-stranded  sheet and two  helices, with overall dimensions of 30 × 30 × 20 Å (Figure 2). Despite low Z scores and sequence identities, a structural similarity search using the DALI server (Holm and Sander, 1998) revealed that YoeB possesses structural similarities to RNase Sa from Streptomyces aureofaciens (PDB code 1RGE, root mean square deviation (rmsd) = 2.6 Å, 53 equivalent  carbon pairs, 6% sequence identity, Z score = 2.7) (Sevcik et al., 1991) and to Barnase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (PDB code 1B20; rmsd = 2.1 Å, 52 equivalent  carbon pairs, 13% sequence identity, Z score = 2.7) (Buckle et al., 1993) (Figure 3A). Despite differences in overall molecular size, the relative orientation of the  sheet elements is quite similar among these proteins. Comparison of toxin sequences (Figure 1B) confirms that other phylogenetically related toxins are structurally similar. In contrast, sequencebased comparisons have failed to predict that YoeB and its homologous toxins contain a microbial RNase

fold. Our structure revealed that these toxins have a compact fold lacking a C-terminal peptide region from a putative active site, compared to previously determined microbial RNase structures, thus explaining why a three-dimensional structure determination was required to identify this noncanonical RNase fold within YoeB and its homologs. The reaction mechanism of microbial RNase involves histidine and glutamic acid residues as general acid and base groups during catalysis, whereas an arginine residue is important for binding the reactive phosphate (Yoshida, 2001). Homology mapping of this toxin family onto the YoeB surface reveals that several highly conserved residues are clustered and hidden by YefM binding (Figure 4B). In this area, residues potentially necessary for RNase activity are concentrated, but locally perturbed, except for the invariant Arg65, a candidate for phosphate binding (Figure 3A). The typical position of the general base residue, glutamic acid, is on the inside of the twisted  sheet (Figure 3A). However, in the YoeB structure, Ser57 occupies this position, and a conserved glutamic acid (Glu46) is on the neighboring strand, S2, with its side chain facing the solvent (Figure 3A). Additionally, the conformation of the last three C-terminal amino acids of YoeB, including His83, the candidate for general acid, is folded backward. These perturbations result in a 3-fold greater increase in distance between the potential general acid and base groups (w21 Å) than typically observed in microbial RNases (Figure 3A). N-Terminal Symmetrical Structure and C-terminal Flexible Peptides of the YefM Dimer The YefM homodimer forms an N-terminal globular structure with two extended ordered and disordered

quence conservation (Figures 4A and 4C, circled). The YoeB binding surface is formed by the acidic H3 helix and C terminus and the neutral H4 helix (Figure 4C). Recognition of YoeB by Asymmetric YefM In the YefM-YoeB complex, one C-terminal peptide of the YefM dimer engages YoeB while the other projects into the solvent (Figures 1A and 2). The difference in behavior indicates that the polypeptide region from the end of the H3 helix to the C terminus is a random coil in the absence of a binding target, and undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon binding YoeB. The N-terminal symmetry and free C terminus of the YefM dimer would, in theory, accommodate a second YoeB. However, binding of one YoeB monomer does not allow the second H4# segment of YefM to order. Inspection of the end of the H3 coiled-coil region reveals that H4 helix formation onYoeB is inclined 17° toward the two-fold axis of the N-terminal dimer (Figure 5B). Therefore, H4# helix formation by binding another YoeB would be sterically hindered, since the orientation of the two H4 helices would not be parallel. Consequently, the YoeB-free H4# region is disordered, and H4 becomes ordered and oriented toward the H3 helix at an angle of 80° (Figures 5A and 5C). The formation of the H4 helix would be coincident with binding of the H3 coiled-coil region to YoeB. The L-shaped turn formed by the H3 and H4 helices is supported by a local hydrophobic cluster consisting of Leu63, Leu64, Ala70, Leu73, and Met74 (Figure 5C). The side chain of Leu63# on the disordering edge of the H3# helix also contributes to this hydrophobic interaction (Figure 5B). In conclusion, the asymmetric organization of the YefM dimer relative to the YoeB monomer is essential for the 2:1 complex formation. Recognition of the YoeB monomer by the YefM dimer occurs at two sites. The major site is the L-shaped turn of YefM hooking the S2-S3 loop of YoeB (buried solvent accessible surface area = 2300 Å2, Figure 5C). The S2S3 loop contains the Leu48 and Leu52 residues, which stabilize the L-shaped turn of YefM. YoeB presents a concave surface created by a twisted  sheet, which exposes hydrophobic residues (Phe55, Val67, Leu76, and Ala78). There are a substantial number of intermolecular van der Waals interactions with the amphipathic H4 helix, which presents the phylogenetically conserved residues Leu73, Met74, Ile77, and Leu80 (Figures 1A and 5C). In addition to the extensive hydrophobic interactions, the side chains of Ser56 and Thr60 on the H3 helix form hydrogen bonds with the backbone of residues in the S2-S3 loop. The H3# helix not only stabilizes the H3 helix but also contributes to YoeB binding (Figures 5A and 5B). The Tyr62# residue interacts with the YoeB His50 and Asn51 side chains (Figures 5B). The remainder of the YefM C-terminal region traverses the dorsal side of YoeB and adopts an extended  strand with extensive contacts (buried solvent accessible surface area = 1000 Å2, Figure 5D). Residues 86­ 88 from the H4 helix of YefM are adjacent to the S1  strand of YoeB, forming a continuous  sheet. The dorsal surface of YoeB is created by three N-terminal secondary structural elements (S1, H1, and H2) (Figure 5D).

Structure of the YefM-YoeB Heterotrimer Complex Ribbon drawing of the asymmetric YefM homodimer with the ordered and disordered C termini (cyan and lavender, respectively) bound to the YoeB monomer (green), viewed perpendicular to the two-fold axis of the YefM N-terminal dimeric structure. N and C termini of the monomers and secondary structure elements are labeled (# denotes elements of the YefM protomer with the disordered C-terminal).

C-terminal segments (Figure 2). The N-terminal region of the dimer forms a symmetrical structure with overall dimensions of 35 × 35 × 50 Å. The single hydrophobic core consists of six  strands (S1-S2-S3-S3#-S2#-S1#) connected by two  helices from each monomer (H1, H2 and H1#, H2#). The H3 helix from each monomer also contributes to the hydrophobic contact. The two H3 helices cross at an angle of 65°, and unlike a parallel coiled-coil formation, this alignment creates a center space that accommodates the large aromatic side chains of the Tyr54 residues from each monomer (Figure 5A). The solvent accessible surface area buried by YefM homodimer formation is 2670 Å2. Superposition of the two N-terminal segments of YefM monomers gave an rmsd of 1.4 Å for 54 equivalent  carbon pairs. A structural similarity search with this N-terminal segment revealed no significant matches against known folds. Comparison of primary sequences (Figure 1A) suggests that other members of this antitoxin family form the same homodimeric structures as YefM. Mapping the sequence homology of this antitoxin family onto the molecular surface of YefM revealed a remarkable conservation in the region that interacts with the YoeB monomer (Figure 4A). A surface electrostatic calculation with isolated YefM demonstrated that the N-terminal dimer is highly acidic (Figure 4C), with the exception of a basic patch, which shows significant se-

Hydrophobic residues (Leu3, Ile4, Trp5, Trp10, and Tyr13) are positioned toward the center of the region, and enclosed by basic residues (Lys2, Lys21, Lys25, Lys32, and Arg35, Figure 4E). The Ile90 and Ile91 side chains of YefM compensate for this hydrophobic patch with van der Waals contacts, and acidic residues (Glu87, Asp89, and Glu92 with C-terminal carboxylate group) neutralize these basic charges with hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Figure 5D). Conformational Change of the C-Terminal Tail of YoeB Determination of the YefM-free YoeB structure highlights the mechanistic conformational change of the three C-terminal amino acids of YoeB upon YefM binding. The peptide region of the three residues clearly folds into a canonical conformation seen in the cata-

lytic site of microbial RNases such as RNase Sa (Figure 3A). With the exception of the three C-terminal amino acids, the YefM-free YoeB structures from both isopropanol and PEG crystallization conditions are essentially identical to that of the bound form (averaged rmsd = 0.67 Å, 1­81  carbon pairs, n = 10 molecules). Superposition of the YefM structure on the YefM-free form of YoeB showed that the imidazole group of YoeB His83 and the C-terminal YoeB Tyr84 are occupied by the side chain of YefM Tyr62 and the YefM H4 helix, respectively (Figure 6B). In the absence of YefM, the YoeB side chain of Tyr82 is closely juxtaposed to the side chain of Arg81, which is supported by Tyr15 (Figure 6B). In the complex structure, a change in the position of the YoeB Tyr82 toward YoeB His83 results in the movement of His83 to the opposite side (Figure 6A). As a result, the Tyr82 of YoeB stacks with the aromatic ring

of the YefM Tyr62. This tyrosine stacking is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds from each hydroxyl group to carbonyl groups of the opposing backbone atoms (OH/ Tyr82/YoeB to O/Tyr62/YefM, OH/Tyr62/YefM to O/Glu63/ YoeB) (Figure 6A). Under this stacking interaction, the YefM Glu59 side chain forms a bidentate hydrogen bond with the side chain of YoeB Arg65, resulting in a threelayered structure (Figures 4C, 4D, and 6A). The arginine residue corresponding to this position in microbial RNases is critical for binding the reactive nucleotide phosphate group. Interestingly, the phylogenetically conserved YefM Glu59 residue seems to mimic the phosphate group (Figure 6A). As a result of the introduction and stabilization of Glu59, the vicinal Glu46 residue of YoeB, which is a candidate general base for catalysis, is forced to change its conformation due to steric repulsion (Figure 3A). The flipped YoeB His83 side chain at the opposite side forms a hydrogen bond to Asp12, which is also significantly conserved in the YoeB family (Figure 6A). The imidazole ring of His83 is sandwiched between the

Arg72 guanidium group of YefM and the YoeB aliphatic portion of Arg81. The Arg81 guanidium group stacks with the neighboring YoeB Tyr15, leading to a slightly curved four-layered structure, which stabilizes this conformation (Figures 4C, 4D, and 6A). The YoeB surface provides space for the flipped His83 to be stabilized by interactions with the YefM antitoxin. The backbone of the YoeB His83 is anchored to the junction between the H3 and H4 helices of YefM, and the amino and carbonyl groups of His83 form hydrogen bonds with the YefM Asn69 and Ser66 side chains, respectively (Figure 6A). In the complex, the YoeB C-terminal Tyr84 projects into the solvent and lies near the edge of Tyr82, forming a hydrogen bond with the YoeB Glu63 side chain without any contact with YefM (Figure 6A). The YefM-free YoeB structure forms a highly negatively charged pocket behind the C terminus (Figure 4D), which consists of the carbonyl group of Arg81, the carboxylate groups of Glu8, Asp12, and the C terminus. The YoeB structure in the PEG crystal form possesses a hexahydrate magnesium ion in the pocket, which neutralizes

the acidic environment (Figure 6B). In the complex form, the YefM Arg72 and the YoeB His83 compensate for the acidic charge in this pocket (Figures 4C and 4D), suggesting that this negatively charged environment also contributes to the conformational changes induced by heterotrimer formation. Thus, the combined effects of stabilization and direct obstruction of the YoeB catalytic site by YefM support this complex structure and suggest that these molecular mechanisms are conserved among this toxin-antitoxin family. Relationship between Binding and Suppression of YoeB Toxicity by YefM To biochemically characterize YoeB binding to the C-terminal segment of YefM, we conducted GST pull-down assays and toxicity suppression tests using wild-type (wt) YoeB and GST-fused YefM deletion mutants (Figures 7A and 7B). The C-terminal region of YefM was able to bind YoeB (Figure 7B, lane 10) and suppressed yoeB toxicity (Figure 7A), whereas N-terminal frag-

ments of the protein neither bound YoeB (Figure 7B, lanes 5 and 6) nor suppressed yoeB toxicity. The H4 helix of YefM, amino acids 67­83 showed minimal affinity for YoeB (Figure 7B, lane 12, 45% of wt), and did not suppress yoeB toxicity (Figure 7A). However, larger fragments of the C-terminal region including the H4 helix were sufficient to bind YoeB and neutralize yoeB toxicity (Figures 7A and 7B, lanes 9 and 11). Interestingly, no detectable binding and colony formation were observed for YefM73C (Figure 7B, lane 8), suggesting that residues 67­73 of the H4 helix are essential for binding and suppression of toxicity. These findings are consistent with the complex structure, in which the L-shaped turn region of YefM H3 to H4 helices engages in direct binding to the YoeB active site. RNase Activity and Substrate Preference of YoeB We tested the in vitro RNase activity of YoeB and inhibition by YefM. In vitro synthesized RNA was digested into smaller fragments after incubation with refolded

A hydrated magnesium ion in the negatively charged pocket is depicted as red spheres with yellow dotted lines. (C) Schematic representation of a transition model from the YefM-free form to the active form of YoeB bound to RNA. Basic, acidic, and hydrophobic residues are color-coded red, blue, and yellow, respectively. RNA is depicted in purple.

YoeB (Figure 7C, lanes 2­4), and the addition of equimolar YefM(10­92) almost inhibited RNA cleavage (Figure 7C, lanes 6­8). YefM itself had no effect on RNA cleavage (Figure 7C, lane 5), and the presence of Mg2+ did not influence this activity (data not shown). These results demonstrate that YoeB is a cytotoxic RNase and that YefM functions as an antitoxin to inhibit the RNase activity of YoeB. To identify residues essential for the enzymatic activity of YoeB, we performed site-directed mutagenesis based on our crystal structures. If YoeB toxicity is linked to its RNase activity, a mutant reducing the activity could be confirmed by assessing the viability of the transformed strain. Four residues, Glu46, Arg65, His83, and Tyr84, were required for YoeB toxicity (Table S2). We tested the RNase activity of five individual mutants. R65A and H83Q completely abolished RNase activity (Figure 7D, lanes 5­8). As judged by this phenotype and by their notable locations within the structure, Arg65 and His83 are likely to be involved in phosphate binding and serve as the general acid in the catalytic reaction, respectively. Y84F and Y84A mutants showed reduced and abolished RNase activity, respectively (Figure 7D, lanes 9­12), indicating that the terminal residue is also essential for the catalytic mechanism. Glu46 probably serves as the catalytic base in the reaction even though the E46A mutant still retains low activity (Figure 7D, lanes 3 and 4). Previous mutagenesis experiments with other RNases showed that substitutions of the general base to other amino acids also display low activity (Grunert et al., 1991; Nishikawa et al., 1987; Sylvester et al., 1997), indicating that other neighboring residues can partially substitute for the general base in the first deprotonaton step. In order to determine the exact sequence of the YoeB cleavage site, primer extension experiments were performed using mRNAs digested by YoeB (Figures 7E and F). The cleavages occurred predominantly at the 3# end

of adenine (A) or guanine (G) nucleotides. Adenine was recognized in preference to guanine. The AG rich (SDlike) sequence in the yefM mRNA was particularly sensitive (Figure 7F). We concluded that YoeB is a purinespecific endoribonuclease in vitro. Previous work has shown that cleavage occurred at adenine tracts using mRNAs extracted from strains overexpressing Lon protease or YoeB (Christensen et al., 2004). These data and our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that YefM degradation is promoted by Lon protease and that free YoeB cleaves mRNA. YoeB Dimerization In the YefM-free crystal, YoeB forms a dimeric structure related by a two-fold axis of symmetry covering the dorsal hydrophobic surfaces (Figure 3C), which are hidden by the YefM C-terminal region in the complex. The homodimer formation buries about 1300 Å2 of solventaccessible surface area. In the center of the dimer interface, Trp5 and Trp10 of each monomer form an aromatic ring cluster. Symmetrical hydrogen bond networks are provided by the Tyr13, Gln17 and Asn28 side chains of each monomer and by a pair of antiparallel S1  strands with two hydrophobic residues, Leu3 and Ile4. Superposition of the YefM C-terminal region on the YoeB dimer clearly showed that hydrophobic residues provided by the second YoeB molecule are found in the inside of the molecular surface of YefM (Figure 3D), suggesting that YoeB dimerization mimics the hydrophobic interaction with the YefM C-terminal region. Discussion Comparison with Other Toxin-Antitoxin Complexes Recent studies have shown that not only plasmid-born but also chromosomal toxin-antitoxin operon modules are surprisingly abundant in bacteria and archaeal with complex phylogenetic pattern (Anantharaman and Ara-

vind, 2003; Pandey and Gerdes, 2005). The E. coli phage P1 addiction module encodes the Phd antitoxin and the Doc toxin (Lehnherr et al., 1993). Interestingly, the N-terminal segment of Phd is evolutionarily conserved with that of YefM, although the Doc toxin forms a phylogenetically distinct cluster from YoeB (Figure 1A, Doc is not shown). Moreover, the Phd-Doc complex forms a heterotrimer with a 2:1 ratio (Gazit and Sauer, 1999a). It is very likely that Phd falls within the subfam-

ily of YefM, sharing a similar N-terminal homodimeric structure, but it probably adopts a different binding scheme to engage the Doc toxin since its C-terminal segment is dissimilar to YefM. This indicates an evolutionary diversity of antitoxin strategies to neutralize toxin function. The E. coli MazE-MazF complex forms a 2:4 heterohexamer (Kamada et al., 2003) that is fundamentally distinct from the YefM-YoeB complex. Despite primary

Molecular Cell 506

sequence differences, both antitoxin structures share a common pattern of potential charge distribution. Each N-terminal domain possesses a conserved basic patch below the symmetrical dimer interface (Figures 4A and 4C, Arg19 and Arg40 from the YefM monomer). Most antitoxins, including the YefM homolog Phd, bind palindromic operator DNA sequences (Gazit and Sauer, 1999b; Marianovsky et al., 2001). The symmetrical underside surface of the antitoxin is likely to serve as the primary DNA anchor. While preparing this manuscript, the crystal structure of the archaeal RelE-RelB toxin-antitoxin complex was determined (Takagi et al., 2005). Except for the extended S2-S3 loop, the archaeal RelE monomer is structurally similar to YoeB (Figure 3B) (PDB code: 1WMI; rmsd = 1.9 Å, 75 equivalent  carbon pairs, 13% sequence identity, Z score = 10.0). The authors reported that RelE has no structural homology, but our data now show that it does possess a microbial RNase fold similar to YoeB (Figure 3B). A site-directed mutagenesis experiment (Takagi et al., 2005) showed that arginine residues clustered on the RelE surface affect in vitro protein synthesis. This surface corresponds to the catalytic site of YoeB. Moreover, our structuralbased comparison revealed that residues involved in YoeB RNase activity (Glu46, His83, and Tyr84) are not conserved in RelE, except for Arg65 (Figure 1B). We therefore suggest that the RelE toxin is an incomplete RNase, which possesses structural features in common with the YoeB-like RNase but lacks the residues essential for catalytic activity. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that purified RelE does not cleave mRNA in the absence of the ribosome (Pedersen et al., 2003). It is likely that the RelE toxin stimulates RNase activity of the ribosome with codon specificity (Hayes and Sauer, 2003). The arginine cluster of RelE may be utilized for recognition of mRNA codon at the ribosomal A site. The YafQ toxin family also has weak similarity to the YoeB toxin (Figure 1B). Comparative modeling based on the YoeB structure showed that YafQ possesses conserved residues potentially serving as the general acid and base for an RNase and that its conserved arginine is provided from a noncanonical position to the potential catalytic site (Figure 1B). It is possible that YafQ is an RNase with the YoeB-like fold and a different type of catalytic site. Implications for Molecular Mechanisms of the YoeB Toxin Previous data about microbial RNase enzymes, together with crystal structures of YoeB, strongly suggests that several steps are required for YoeB catalytic activity. All microbial RNases have a longer C-terminal peptide than YoeB to stabilize the catalytic loop, in which side chains of the general acid histidine and the neighboring tyrosine are oriented to the active site (Yoshida, 2001). Our YoeB structure shows that the side chain of the terminal residue Tyr84 projects toward the solvent (Figure 6B), whereas Y84F and Y84A mutant affected RNase cleavage activity (Figure 7D, lanes 9­12). RNA binding is likely to change the orientation of the Tyr84 side chain to stabilize the active site (Figure 6C).

The aromatic ring of Tyr84 might be held by side chains of Leu48 and Leu52 on the S2-S3 loop, and then the hydroxyl group could be pointed to the active site. At this time, a purine base would be preferentially recognized by the S2-S3 loop. Studies about specific recognition of guanines by Barnase have documented that the guanine N7 and O6 accept hydrogen bonds from two amido groups of the peptide backbone (Buckle and Fersht, 1994). In YoeB, the carbonyl group of Lys49 and the amido group of Leu52 on the S2-S3 loop are assumed to form hydrogen bonds to adenine NH6 and guanine O6, respectively. The cleavage specificity posterior to the purine base could be accounted for by hydrogen bond formation of the amido group of Lys49 with the purine N7, which is absent in pyrimidines (Figure 6C). Dimerization of YoeB through the hydrophobic/basic dorsal surface is competitive with C-terminal YefM antitoxin binding, but the contribution to blocking YoeB RNase activity is negligible (Figures 7A). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments also revealed that YoeB dimerizes at concentrations of 1.6­17 M (0.1­0.5 M NaCl, data not shown). This weak association suggests that dimer formation is not likely under physiological conditions. However, the crystal structure of the archaeal RelE-RelB complex demonstrated that the corresponding RelE toxin surface is shared by the C-terminal region of RelB, as seen in the YefM-YoeB complex, although the overall wrapping trajectories of the two antitoxin peptides are quite different (Figure 3B). Moreover, the exposed hydrophobic residues on the dorsal surface are highly conserved among the YoeB, RelE and YafQ families (Figure 1B, gray color). All lines of evidence suggest that the dorsal surface mediates an important conserved function that is independent of toxic activity. We hypothesize that the surface common to these toxins is responsible for their interface with other factors. The ribosome-associated RNase activity of RelE, for example, implies ribosomal binding of these toxins (Pedersen et al., 2003). Characterization of this surface has to await more extensive mutagenesis studies in combination with in vitro translation assays.

Conclusions Our structural, genetic and biochemical analyses of the E. coli YefM antitoxin and YoeB toxin have provided a detailed 3D structural view of the complex and the free toxin, and have clarified the mechanism by which the YefM antitoxin binds the YoeB RNase and induces a conformational change of the active site. Our structures provide a scaffold for targeted mutagenesis to identify operator DNA recognition by the heterocomplex, YefM antitoxin degradation, and YoeB toxin recognition by other factors. Our work also suggests that there is an evolutionary relationship between microbial RNases and a subset of toxin families. Finally, these structures provide a basis for understanding antibacterial therapies. The host/plasmid-born antitoxin molecule may be a suitable target for development of "anti-antitoxins" capable of inducing intrinsic toxin activity by release of

antitoxin, or by disruption of antitoxin oligomeric structures.
Experimental Procedures Protein Expression and Purification DNA fragments encoding full-length yefM and yoeB were amplified from E. coli K-12 genomic DNA by PCR and subcloned under the T7 promoter in pET-28a and pET-11a vectors (Novagen), respectively. Full-length and an N-terminal truncated form (amino acids 10­92) of YefM were expressed with an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag and a human rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site. YoeB was expressed without any tags. These two vectors were cotransformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) to produce the antitoxin-toxin complex. Following cell lysis, the oligomeric YefM-YoeB complex was purified via Ni2+ affinity chromatography, and the hexa-histidine tag was removed by proteolysis. Serial column chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose yielded highly purified toxinantitoxin complexes. Selenomethionine-labeled (Se-Met) YefMYoeB complexes were expressed and purified using the same procedure as described above. YefM-free YoeB was extracted from a Ni2+ chelating column, on which the YefM-YoeB heterocomplex had been immobilized via the histidine-tagged YefM, by a buffer containing 6M Guanidine-HCl. The fraction of denatured YoeB was adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml and then refolded by dialyzing gradually against 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT at 4°C. The refolded YoeB was further purified to homogeneity by Heparin-Sepharose and gel filtration columns. The hexa-histidine tagged YefM antitoxin (amino acids 10­92) was expressed alone and purified via Ni2+ affinity chromatography. After removal of the hexa-histidine tag, YefM was further purified using a Q-Sepharose column. Crystallization and Structure Determination Crystals of native and Se-Met YefM-YoeB complexes were grown by sitting-drop vapor diffusion (21 mg/ml complex) against a reservoir solution containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM DTT at 20°C. Hexagonal crystals grow to a typical size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.6 mm in the space group P64 or P31 (dependent on individual native and Se-Met crystals due to perturbation of the crystallographic two-fold axis) with unit cell dimensions a = b = 88.45 Å, c = 135.15 Å, and diffract to 2.02 Å resolution. These crystals contain two antitoxin-toxin heterotrimer complexes in the P64 space group and four in P31. Crystal cryoprotection was achieved by adding glycerol to a final concentration of 30% (v/v). Two types of crystals of YefM-free YoeB were grown by hangingdrop vapor diffusion (21 mg/ml) against reservoir solutions containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.2 M CH3COONH4, and 30% (v/v) isopropanol at 4°C, or 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.2 M MgCl2, and 20%(v/v) PEG 8000 at 20°C. Rhombohedral crystals from the isopropanol condition grow to a typical size of 0.4 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm in the space group P21 (a = 28.97 Å, b = 60.99 Å, c = 98.56 Å,  = 98.03°) with four molecules/asymmetric unit and diffract to 1.77 Å resolution. Cryoprotection of the crystals was achieved by adding glycerol to a final concentration of 20% (v/v). Needle-shaped crystals from the PEG conditions grow to a typical size of 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.2 mm in the space group C2 (a = 163.90 Å, b = 43.14 Å, c = 89.37 Å,  = 118.49°) with six molecules/asymmetric unit and diffract to 2.05 Å resolution. Cryoprotection of the crystals was achieved by adding glycerol to a final concentration of 25% (v/v). Diffraction data for both native (P64) and Se-Met (P31) crystals of YefM-YoeB complexes were collected at SPring-8 Beamline BL41XU and for YefM-free YoeB at Photon factory Beamline BL-5. All data were processed with the HKL2000 program package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). A total of 25 selenium sites in the YefMYoeB complex were located with SnB (Weeks and Miller, 1999), and experimental phases were calculated at 2.3 Å resolution with MLPHARE (Project, 1994) using multiple isomorphous replacement/anomalous scattering. Density modification calculated with DM (Project, 1994) yielded a high-quality electron density map. A partial model (50% of the residues in asymmetric unit) was built automatically with ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 2001), and the remainder of the structure was completed by manual building with O

(Jones et al., 1991). Iterative rounds of refinement were performed with CNS (Brünger et al., 1998). The final refinement model of the native YefM-YoeB complex consists of YoeB (all residues 1­84) and the YefM homodimer (molecule A and C, 10­92, and 3 residues of N-terminal cloning artifact; molecule B and D, 10­65, and 3 residues of N-terminal cloning artifact) for two heterotrimers in an asymmetric unit, and 153 water molecules. YoeB structures from the two crystal forms were determined by molecular replacement with CNS using a search model of YoeB structure from the YefM-YoeB complex. The PC-refinement correlation coefficient for isopropanol crystal form = 48.9% and PEG crystal form = 56.9%. Rigid body refinement and Powel minimization with CNS yielded clear differences in electron density for the three C-terminal residues of YoeB between the complex and YefM-free forms (Figures S1A and S1B). The final refinement model for the isopropanol crystal form consists of four YoeB molecules (all residues 1­84, but missing residue 84 for molecules A and D), 314 water molecules, and 6 isopropanol molecules, giving a working R factor of 19.5% and a free R value of 22.3%. The final refinement model for the PEG crystal form consists of six YoeB molecules (all residues 1­84, but missing residue 84 for molecule C), 340 water molecules, and two hydrated magnesium ions. Analytical Ultracentrifuge Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-I instrument. YoeB (0.36 mg/ml) was centrifuged in a Beckman An-60T rotor with a 6-sector centerpiece. The protein samples for centrifugation were dialyzed against a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and 0.1, 0.2, or 0.5 M NaCl. Equilibrium distributions were analyzed after 20 hr of centrifugation at 20,000 rpm and 20°C. For the molecular weight analysis, a partial specific volume of 0.737 cm3/g was used. GST Pull-Down Assay DNA fragments of yefM encoding wild-type and truncated mutants were subcloned into pGEX-6p-1 (Amersham) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. These GST-YefM fusions and GST were expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified with glutathione Sepharose. Immobilized GST fusion proteins (15 l of resin volume) were equilibrated with refolded YoeB (100 g) in 50 l of buffer (50 mM TrisHCl [pH 7.5], 250 mM NaCl), incubated for 1 hr at 4°C, and washed three times with the same buffer. Resin bound proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. Toxicity Test for yoeB All of the constructs of yoeB mutants were generated by PCR and cloned into the pET-11a vector (Novagen). The plasmids were transformed into the BL21 or BL21(DE3) strains (Novagen) on LB plates containing 200 g/ml ampicillin. For suppression tests with truncated yefM mutants, the yoeB wt gene was recloned into the pACYC vector (P15A origin) under the T7 promoter. Two plasmids, yoeB wt in pACYC and yefM wt or mutant in pGEX-6p-1, were cotransformed into the BL21 strain on LB plates containing 200 g/ ml ampicillin and 20 g/ml chloramphenicol. Viability was assessed after 12 hr incubation at 37°C. RNA Cleavage by YoeB A DNA fragment containing the T7 promoter and the yefM gene was obtained by PCR amplification. The yefM mRNA was synthesized in vitro using the T7-MEGAshortscript kit (Ambion). The digestion reaction mixture (10 l) contained 320 ng of the yefM mRNA substrate of w350 bases, different amounts of YoeB and/or YefM, and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). The reaction was performed at 37°C for 1 hr, and stopped by adding 10 l of the sequencing loading buffer. The sample was incubated at 95°C for 3 min prior to loading on a 1.2% native agarose gel containing 2 g/ml ethidium bromide with TBE buffer. Primer Extension Inhibition Assay The yefM mRNA and the human 18S rRNA (w130 bases, control for the kit) were used as templates. Each specific DNA primer was synthesized and 5# labeled with [-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide

Molecular Cell 508

kinase. Primers (0.8 pmol) were annealed to each template (1 pmol) in 10 l by incubation at 90°C for 5 min and then slow cooling to room temperature. The reaction mixture was digested by adding 1 l of various amounts of YoeB at 37°C for 1 hr. Subsequent primer extension reaction was performed by adding 4 l of 5× buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 375 mM KCl, and 15 mM MgCl2), 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM dNTP, and 20 U of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for a final reaction volume of 20 l. cDNA was synthesized at 55°C for 30 min, and then purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The products were subjected to 8% denaturing PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography.
