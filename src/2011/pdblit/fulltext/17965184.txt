Abstract Serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is a serine/threonine protein kinase of the AGC family which participates in the control of epithelial ion transport and is implicated in proliferation and ∞ apoptosis. We report here the 1.9 A crystal structure of the catalytic domain of inactive human SGK1 in complex with AMP≠PNP. SGK1 exists as a dimer formed by two intermolecular disulfide bonds between Cys258 in the activation loop and Cys193. Although most of the SGK1 structure closely resembles the common protein kinase fold, the structure around the active site is unique when compared to most protein kinases. The aC helix is not present in this inactive form of SGK1 crystal structure; instead, the segment corresponding to the C helix forms a b-strand that is stabilized by the N-terminal segment of the activation loop through a short antiparallel b-sheet. Since the differences from other kinases occur around the ATP binding site, this structure can provide valuable insight into the design of selective and highly potent ATP-competitive inhibitors of SGK1 kinase.

Protein kinases are one of the largest superfamilies in the human genome and have a critical role in the regulation of eukaryotic cells. The serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK1) gene encodes a protein of 50 kDa that is a member of the AGC family of serine/threonine protein kinase. Its catalytic domain is 45%≠60% homol-

ogous to the catalytic domains of other serine/threonine protein kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), and the protein kinase C family (Webster et al. 1993). Two isoforms--SGK2 and SGK3--of SGK1 have been identified; the biological importance of these isoforms remains unclear. SGK1 is expressed in most vertebrate tissues including eye, brain, lungs, kidney, ovary, gut, pancreas, skeletal muscle, heart, and liver (Bhargava and Pearce 2004). However, the expression pattern within tissues shows considerable heterogeneity with respect to both basal and ¥ ¥ stimulated levels of expression (Naray-Fejes-Toth et al. 1999). SGK1 can be transcriptionally up-regulated by a variety of hormonal and nonhormonal stimuli, including 2761

serum, follicle stimulating hormone (Alliston et al. 1997), osmotic shock (Waldegger et al. 1997; Rozansky et al. 2002), ischemia (Bhargava and Pearce 2004), transforming growth factor beta (Waldegger 1999), glucocorticoids ¥ and mineralocorticoids (Chen et al. 1999; Naray-Fejes¥ Toth et al. 1999; Shigaev et al. 2000; Bhargava and Pearce 2004). SGK1 is not only transcriptionally regulated, but its activity can be also modulated. Like PKB/AKT, one of its closest relatives, SGK1 has a phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5trisphosphate-dependent kinase (PDK) consensus site that is a phosphorylation target of PDK1 (Kobayashi et al. 1999). Phosphorylation and activation of SGK1 through a PI3 kinase pathway can be stimulated by insulin (Kobayashi et al. 1999; Park et al. 1999; Wang et al. 2001) and FSH (Gonzalez-Robayna et al. 2000). Because SGK1 is regulated by a variety of signals, it has many functions. SGK1 has been shown to regulate several ion channels, including the renal distal tubule ¥ ¥ epithelial sodium channel ENaC (Naray-Fejes-Toth et al. 1999), Na+/K+ ATPase (Zecevic et al. 2004), the renal outer medullary K+ channel (ROMK1), the voltage-gated K+ channel (Kv1.3), the voltage-gated K+ channel KCNE1/KCNQ1, the voltage-gated cardiac Na+ channel SCN5A, the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3, the Na+/K+/2Cl¿ cotransporter NKCC2, the intestinal phosphate transporter NaPiIIb, the glucose transporter SGLT1, the Na+ coupled dicarboxylate transporter NaDC-1, the glutamine transporter SN1, and the glutamate transporters EAAT1 and EAAT3 (Lang et al. 2003). One of the mechanisms whereby SGK1 regulates channels is through phosphorylation of Nedd4-2, a ubiquitin ligase that targets channels for degradation. SGK1 phosphorylates and decreases the activity of Nedd4-2 in renal distal tubule epithelial cells, which in turn increases the abundance of ENaC on the apical membrane (Debonneville et al. 2001; Snyder et al. 2002). Other substrates of SGK1 can also contribute to its activity. For example, the stimulating effect of SGK1 on NHE3 (Yun et al. 2002a) and NaDC-1 (Boehmer et al. 2004) requires the presence of NHERF2. Finally, SGK1 may directly phosphorylate channels such as ROMK, thus altering the pH sensitivity of the ion channel (Yun et al. 2002b; Palmada et al. 2003). The span of SGK1 activities could be just as great including the regulation of cell volume and extracellular fluid volume, electrolyte homeostasis, blood pressure, and cellular proliferation and death. Indeed, mice with deletion of the SGK1 gene have decreased blood pressure and renal function during sodium deprivation (Wulff et al. 2002). In addition to its role in the control of epithelial ion transport, SGK1 has been implicated in the control of proliferation and apoptosis. SGK1 can phosphorylate and inactivate the Forkhead family member, FKHRL1, a proapoptotic transcription factor (Brunet et al. 2001), 2762
Protein Science, vol. 16

and recent direct evidence suggests that SGK1 can be antiapoptotic (Mikosz et al. 2001). Furthermore, studies indicate that the phosphorylation of SGK1 at Ser78 by mitogen-activated kinase BMK is necessary for growth factor-induced entry of cells into S-phase (Hayashi et al. 2001). We have determined the crystal structure of the catalytic kinase domain of SGK1 bound to AMP≠PNP ∞ at 1.9 A resolution. This is the first report of a crystal structure of a member of the SGK family of protein kinases. The structural information from this SGK binary complex and from comparison to the closely related PKA structure should increase our understanding of structural features, which can form the basis for design of potent and selective SGK1 inhibitors. Results Overall structure of inactive SGK1 KD and comparison with PKA KD SGK1 has the typical bilobal kinase fold (Hanks et al. 1988; Bossemeyer et al. 1993), comprised of an Nterminal b-strand domain (residues 60≠179) and a Cterminal a-helical domain (residues 180≠431). The two domains are linked together by a hinge region that forms an important part of the catalytic active site. A ribbon diagram of the SGK1:AMP≠PNP complex structure is shown in Figure 1. SGK1 belongs to the AGC subfamily of protein kinases, which includes PKA, AKT/PKB, PKC, MSK,

SGK, and the p70 and p90 S6 kinases. A sequence comparison of SGK1 with PKA (Knighton et al. 1991, 1993; Zheng et al. 1993), AKT2 (PKBb) (Yang et al. 2002), and MSK1 (Smith et al. 2004) suggests that the SGK1 structure will have the conserved protein kinase domain and ATP-binding site (see Fig. 2A). Crystal structures of PKA complexed with ATP or adenosine and a peptide inhibitor are believed to represent the bioactive conformations of protein kinases. The inactive SGK1 KD structure is overall structurally and topologically similar to that of PKA. A main chain superimposition of PKA (PDB:1APM) and SGK1 is shown in Figure 2B. The root mean square deviation calculated for 167 Ca ∞ atoms in the core of the C-terminal domain is 1.1 A. The structure, however, shows some significant differences from PKA and other kinases around the ATP and peptide substrate binding sites. Conformation of the a-helix C and activation loop The most striking difference between inactive SGK1 and other AGC kinases is the lack of helix aC. This helix plays an important role in all protein kinases; in the PKA structure, Glu91 on this helix hydrogen bonds to the catalytic residue Lys72, which in turn interacts with the b phosphate of ATP. Both residues are highly conserved in all protein kinases, and the corresponding residues are Glu146 and Lys127 in SGK1. In this inactive SGK1 structure, the residues corresponding to this helix section are either in an unordered loop (residues 136≠148) or in an extended b-strand conformation (residues 150≠154). Glu146 is in the disordered loop in our structure, while Lys127 is clearly defined and interacts with the bphosphate of AMP≠PNP. A second notable variation relative to PKA is the conformation of the activation loop, residues 240≠266. Residues 241≠244, which encompass the conserved DFG motif, are in an extended b-strand conformation and form a short antiparallel b-sheet with the backbone of residues 150≠153 in the region corresponding to aC in PKA and other kinases. The new antiparallel b-sheet is shown in red in Figure 1 and Figure 2B. The conformation of the b-sheet and the electron density are shown in Figure 2C. All AGC-family members require phosphorylation of an invariant Ser/Thr residue in the activation segment for activity. The phosphorylation residue Thr256 is located on the surface of SGK1, and its side chain interacts with solvent atoms. The nearby residue Cys258 forms an intermolecular disulfide bond with Cys193 of another SGK1 molecule. The C-terminal region of the activation loop is well-defined, while a part of the N-terminal region, residues 249≠252, is more flexible, as reflected in the high temperature factors in the final model.

Structure of the ATP-binding site AMP≠PNP binds in a deep hydrophobic cleft at the interface of the N- and C-terminal domains as observed for other protein kinases. AMP≠PNP, Mg2+, and numerous conserved residues at the active site of the enzyme are clearly defined. A representation of the SGK1 active site is drawn in Figure 3. The 6-amino and 1-imido groups of AMP≠PNP bind to the hinge region of SGK1 through direct hydrogen bonds with the main-chain carbonyl and amide groups of the residues Asp177 and Ile179 (hydrogen∞ ∞ bond distances of 2.77 A and 3.03 A, respectively). This part of the linker region is structurally conserved in many other kinases, and these interactions with adenosine are very similar to those seen between adenosine or ATP analogs and other protein kinases. In the ternary complex of PKA (Knighton et al. 1991), the planar adenosine ring of ATP is involved in numerous hydrophobic interactions with residues Leu49, Val57, Ala70, Val104, Met120, Glu121, Tyr122, Val123, Leu173, Thr183, and Phe327. These residues are conserved in SGK1; they are Ile104, Val112, Ala125, Val160, Leu176, Asp177, Tyr178, Ile179, Leu229, Thr239, and Phe385, respectively. In the inactive SGK1 structure, these conserved residues adopt very similar conformations with the exception of Thr239 and Phe385. Thr239, located just before the conserved DFG motif, instead of interacting with adenosine, is rotated away from the adenosine and interacts with Asn227. Phe385 along with other C-terminal residues is absent in the structure due to its disordered state. The charged residues that interact with ribose and triphosphate include Lys127, Glu183, Asp222, Lys224, Glu226, and Asn227. The side chain of conserved Lys127 interacts with the b-phosphate of AMP≠PNP. In PKA, this catalytic lysine, Lys72, forms a hydrogen bond with Glu91in helix aC. In contrast, the corresponding Glu146 in SGK1 is not visible in the electron density. The side chain of Glu183 forms a hydrogen bond with one of the hydroxyl groups of the ribose moiety. The invariant residue Asp222, which is equivalent to the catalytic base Asp166 in PKA, points toward the g-phosphate. The side chain of Lys224, which is proposed to stabilize the transition state, interacts with oxygen atoms on the g-phosphate. In addition, the side chain of Glu226 interacts with the oxygen atom between the a- and b-phosphates of AMP≠PNP through the Mg2+ ion. Finally, the side chain of Asn227 interacts with the nitrogen between the b- and g-phosphates. The active site cleft is bounded by the activation loop (defined as residues 240≠266) and the glycine-rich loop, which contains the consensus kinase sequence GXGXfG (residues 105≠110, f is Phe109). The glycine-rich loop adopts a closed conformation interacting with AMP≠PNP via backbone interactions. One of the oxygen atoms of the b-phosphate is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the main-chain amide group of Ser108. The major difference

formed by helices aB and aC and strand b5. In the SGK1 structure there is a similar hydrophobic pocket on the top of the N-domain formed by residues Leu129, Leu150, Leu151, Leu172, and Phe174. The SGK1 construct we used includes all the C-terminal residues corresponding to the conserved region in PKA, but the C-terminal FXXF hydrophobic motif does not interact with the N-domain hydrophobic pocket in SGK1. Instead, the pocket is occupied by N-terminal residues Ile83 and Leu85. The C-terminal residues are free and flexible and are thus disordered in this structure. Dimer structure SGK1 forms a homodimer in the crystal even though there is only a single monomer in the asymmetric unit. The dimer is formed through two disulfide bonds between the two molecules. Both Cys193 and Cys258 form disulfide bonds with Cys258 and Cys193, respectively, of the neighboring molecule (Fig. 4). Cys193, following the helix aD, is not conserved in other AGC family members but is conserved in the SGK family. Cys258 is located near the C-terminal end of the activation loop and is conserved in other AGC family members (Fig. 2A). Discussion The SGK1 protein we describe is a mutant, with mutations from wild type at S74A, S78A, S397A, S401A,

relative to the PKA structure occurs in the beginning of the activation loop and the DFG motif. Starting with the DFG motif, the peptide chain is shifted close to the bstrand made by residues 150≠154 (the location equivalent to aC in other kinases) and forms a new antiparallel b-sheet. As a result, the side chain of Asp240 points away from AMP≠PNP, and the benzyl ring of Phe241 points up, sitting in the hydrophobic pocket surrounded by hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal domain. In contrast, the aspartic acid of the DFG sequence in PKA, Asp 184, is involved in the coordination of the two Mg2+ ions associated with ATP. The benzyl ring of Phe185 in PKA points down and interacts with the C-domain hydrophobic residues. Changes in the hydrophobic motif binding For full kinase activity, all AGC family members require phosphorylation of a serine or threonine residue in the activation loop and also require phosphorylation of a serine or threonine residue in a so-called hydrophobic motif located in a conserved region of the C-terminal segment. The hydrophobic motif is characterized by three aromatic amino acids surrounding the serine/threonine residue that becomes phosphorylated: Phe-X-X-Phe-Ser/ Thr-Phe/Tyr (Biondi et al. 2001; Frodin et al. 2002). In ® PKA and AKT2, the C-terminal peptide chain folds back on the top of the N-domain and the FXXF motif docks into a hydrophobic pocket (Knighton et al. 1991; Yang et al. 2002). The side chains of Phe347 and Phe350 in the FXXF motif of PKA are buried in the hydrophobic pocket

S422D, and R192A. The first four mutations are included to remove nonspecific phosphorylation sites and obtain more homogeneous protein. Phosphorylation of both Thr256 and Ser422 is required for full SGK1 activity; since the mechanism of Ser422 phosphorylation is not known, the S422D mutation was made to mimic the phosphorylated serine and thereby confer full activity to SGK1 once Thr256 is phosphorylated by PDK1. Residue Arg192 is located at the surface of the dimer interface near the disulfide bond between Cys193 and Cys258 in the activation loop of a neighboring protein molecule; all residues in the contact area have good electron density except for the side chain of Arg192. The R192A mutation was therefore designed to reduce the conformational entropy of the side chain (Derewenda 2004) and to promote formation of the intermonomer disulfide bond. To determine the effect of these mutations on the enzyme activity, we phosphorylated the mutant in vitro with PDK1. The enzymatic activity of S74A/S78A/S397A/ S401A/S422D/R192A SGK1 is the same as that of wild-type enzyme when activated (data not shown), and so this set of mutations is not expected to dramatically affect the natural three-dimensional structure. Several reports have described the remarkable plasticity in the kinase domain structure of inactive kinases (Johnson et al. 1996; Huse and Kuriyan 2002). Since all protein kinases catalyze the same reaction--transfer of the g-phosphate of ATP to the hydroxyl group of a serine, threonine, or tyrosine side chain--protein kinases adopt a very similar structural conformation in the catalytically active form. By contrast, inactive kinases can adopt many distinct conformations, which may allow interactions with specific regulatory domains or proteins. The inactive SGK1 structure, with its unique conformation in the aC and activation loop regions, may indicate that aC and the activation loop are important for substrate recognition and binding and thus are two key regulatory elements within the kinase domain. We expect that upon activation, SGK1 will adopt a conformation similar to other active form of AGC family kinases. The amino acid sequence of SGK1 provides a plausible explanation for the disordered aC helix. Six successive large hydrophilic residues (KKKEEK, residues 136≠141) are located at the beginning of the segment corresponding to aC, while there are only three hydrophilic residues in this region in AKT2 and four in PKA. These large hydrophilic residues are generally quite solvent exposed and may make the peptide chain more flexible. The structure of an inactive and unliganded AKT2 kinase domain has been reported recently. It differs from active AKT2 in that most of the a-helix C is disordered in the inactive Akt2 (Huang et al. 2003). In the inactive SGK1structure, the residues 149≠154 are in an extended conformation rather than forming a-helix; this extended 2766

conformation is stabilized by the N-terminal portion of the activation loop. Both strands, residues 149≠154 and the activation loop strand, form a short antiparallel bsheet structure. A similar conformation has been found in an inactive structure of MSK1, another member of the AGC family. In the MSK1 structure, the inactive conformation is stabilized by the formation of a new threestranded b-sheet on the N lobe of the kinase domain (Smith et al. 2004). The new three-stranded b-sheet occupies a position equivalent to the N terminus of the a-helix C in active protein kinases. The activation loop in this structure adopts a conformation distinctive from that of other AGC family members. It appears to sterically hinder the binding of peptide substrate. The formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds could contribute to the conformation of the activation loop. The formation of the dimer may be a result of crystal packing, since the protein sample was monomeric in solution (as described in Materials and Methods). Homologous to the SGK1 sequence, AKT2 has two cysteines in the activation loop, Cys297 and Cys311, but they form an intramolecular disulfide bond in the inactive AKT2 structure (Huang et al. 2003). The corresponding cysteines in SGK1 are Cys244 and Cys258. Cys258 forms an intermolecular disulfide bond, while Cys244, which follows the DFG motif, is free. In PKA, the phosphorylated activation loop adopts an open conformation stabilized by ionic interactions between the phosphorylated side chains of Thr197 and basic residues, Arg165 and Lys189. Thr256, the phosphorylation site in SGK1, is not phosphorylated in this structure and is located far away from Arg221 and Lys245, the basic residues corresponding to Arg165 and Lys189 in PKA. Arg221 in the SGK1 structure is in the same position as Arg165 in PKA, but its side chain is disordered. Lys245, however, has a different position. Instead of locating in the C-terminal domain as Lys189 in PKA, it joins the N-terminal lobe, and the side chain is also disordered. The Ca distances from Thr256 to Arg221 ∞ ∞ and to Lys245 are about 23 A and 25 A, respectively. It is likely that the location of Thr256 is determined by Cys258, which is located at the protein surface and forms a disulfide bond with a neighboring molecule. This indicates again that the conformation of the activation loop is more flexible relative to other parts of the kinase domain and the conformation is affected by the intermolecular disulfide bond in this instance. However, it is unlikely that dimerization is the cause for the disordered aC helix; the disulfide bond and the aC helix residues are located on the opposite surface of the protein, with a ∞ distance of more than 32 A from Ca atoms of aC helix residues to the Ca atom of Cys258. Many AGC family members share the property of being regulated by phosphorylation within the conserved

C-terminal FXXF hydrophobic motif (Frodin et al. 2002). ® Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif promotes the interaction of SGK1 with the PIF-binding pocket of PDK1 and phosphorylation of the activation loop. Thus, hydrophobic-motif phosphorylation of SGK1 converts it into a substrate that can be activated by PDK1 (Biondi et al. 2001). Both SGK1 and AKT2 have a serine and a tyrosine (Ser422, Tyr423 in SGK1) immediately following the FXXF motif. Serine is an important phosphorylation site and tyrosine is important for the interaction with the HM binding pocket. In AKT2, the C-terminal FXXF motif is docked into a hydrophobic pocket on the top of the N-lobe. In the SGK1 structure, the comparable hydrophobic pocket is instead, occupied by N-terminal residues; we do not know if this reflects the protein conformation in vivo. The hydrophobic pocket is formed by residues in the Nterminal lobe. In ATK2, Val194 and Val198 in the aC helix contribute to formation of the hydrophobic pocket. The big hydrophilic residue, Glu140 of SGK1, which corresponds to Val194 in AKT2, is not conserved and is unlikely to be involved in the formation of the stable hydrophobic pocket. Met144 of SGK1, corresponding to Val198 in AKT2, is conserved but disordered in this structure. The SGK1 construct we used had an S422D mutation and therefore could not undergo serine phosphorylation at that site. It is possible that a conformational change may occur upon phosphorylation of Ser422, resulting in binding of the HM to the HM binding pocket and ordering the helix C. Most of the N-lobe residues responsible for the formation of the hydrophobic pocket and phosphoserine docking site are conserved in SGK1. Therefore, we would expect active SGK1 to adopt the same conformation as active AKT2. In contrast to SGK1, PKA has a unique long Nterminal a-helix that makes extensive contacts with the kinase domain. This helix is critical to the relative orientation of the N- and C-terminal lobes as well as to the optimal positioning of the aC helix and the FXXF motif in active PKA. The construct we used has the same length at the N terminus. However, sequence alignment shows that the N-terminal residues are not well conserved among AGC family members. In the inactive SGK1 structure, most of the N-terminal residues are missing (residues 59≠81). The visible N-terminal residues, from residue 82 to 85, are in an extended conformation and interact with the HM hydrophobic pocket. The peptide chain from residue 88 to 90 forms a short b-strand, which is parallel with the b4 strand and is part of the N-domain b-sheet structure. In conclusion, the inactive SGK1 structure reveals structural features important for substrate binding and selectivity. Specifically, unique secondary structures of the aC region and interactions of that region with the rest

of the protein stabilize the activation loop of SGK1. We propose that SGK1 will have a different secondary structure at these regions once it becomes activated. This inactive SGK1 structure should prove useful in the design of selective inhibitors for pharmacological and therapeutic investigations of SGK regulation. Materials and Methods SGK1 kinase domain expression and purification
An amino terminally truncated version of SGK1's kinase domain (KD) (residues 60≠431) (GenBank accession number AF011468) with an S422D mutation was obtained from the University of Dundee. An in-frame caspase 5 cleavage site was added at the 59 end of the coding sequence by PCR. The resulting fragment was cloned into Gateway pDONR 201 cloning vector (Invitrogen, No. 11798-014) as described in the Invitrogen Gateway technology manual. An additional four Ser to Ala mutations, S74A, S78A, S397A, and S401A, and an R192A mutation were introduced using the Stratagene mutagenesis kit, No. 200513. The construct was then validated via DNA sequencing. Serines 74, 78, 397, and 401 were identified by phosphosite mapping of the wild-type protein, and the four Ser to Ala mutations were made to eliminate the phosphorylation heterogeneity of the baculovirus-expressed protein. In order to express SGK1 as a GST fusion, the coding sequence was moved into a Gateway GST tagged expression vector, pDEST20, via an LR reaction. Recombinant baculovirus was generated as described in a Bac-to-Bac system by Invitrogen (No. 10359016). To overexpress the GST-casp5-hsgk1 mutant protein, an Sf9 cell culture in exponential growth phase was infected with the rBV. The culture was harvested by centrifugation at 48 h post-infection. The cell pellet harboring the recombinant protein of interest was processed for purification. The SGK1 construct was purified by capturing the GST fusion protein on glutathione sepharose resin (GE Healthcare). The column was then washed to baseline and the SGK1 cleaved off using caspase5 at a 1:15 ratio at room temperature for 4 h. The His-tagged caspase5 was removed by passing the protein solution over a small NiNTA column (Qiagen). After caspase5 removal, the protein was concentrated and loaded onto a SDX200 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column equilibrated in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. This step removed the very large aggregates that eluted at the void volume of the column. The monomer peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10≠15 mg/mL for crystallography.

Crystallization and structure determination
Crystals of the SGK1/AMP≠PNP/Mg complex were grown by sitting-drop vapor diffusion from a solution of 18%≠21% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 0.2 M lithium sulfate buffered with 0.1 M TRIS (pH 8.5). MgCl2 and AMP≠PNP were added to the SGK1 enzyme solution immediately before crystallization to give a final concentration of 3 mM. AMP≠PNP is a nonhydrolizable ATP analog (adenosine 59[beta gamma-imido]triphosphate) (Sigma-Aldrich catalog No. 01910). Crystals started to appear after 2 wk and took 6 wk to grow to full size at 20∞C. Crystals were harvested and then allowed to equilibrate in a similar crystallization solution, this time containing 18% ethylene glycol, prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen.

Zhao et al.

X-ray diffraction data were collected using the MARCCD165 detector at the Industrial Macromolecular Crystallography Association beamline 17-ID at the Advanced Photon Source in the Argonne National Laboratory. Diffraction data were indexed and scaled using the HKL2000 software (Otwinowski and Minor 1997) (see Table 1). The crystals belong to hexagonal space group P6522, with a single enzyme complex per asymmetric unit. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using a homologous structure of PKA (PDB code 1APM) (Knighton et al. 1993) in the program X-PLOR (Brunger 1993). The initial molecular replacement solution was subject to multiple rounds of molecular dynamics refinement in CNX (Brunger et al. 1998) and rebuilding with the program O (Jones et al. 1991). The bound AMP≠PNP and Mg molecules could be clearly seen in the difference-Fourier maps. ∞ The first data set were collected to 2.5 A resolution and the structure was solved using this data set. In order to improve the diffraction of the crystal, we designed site-directed mutation R192A. This R192A mutation was designed to reduce the conformational entropy of the amino acid side chain (Derewenda 2004) and to promote formation of a disulfide bond between the nearby residue Cys193 and Cys258 in the activation loop of a neighboring protein molecule. The mutant protein complexed with AMP≠PNP-Mg was crystallized under the same conditions as the wild-type protein. As predicted, the diffraction of the ∞ crystal increased to 1.9 A resolution. ∞ The structure has been refined at 1.9 A resolution by the program REFMAC (Howlin et al. 1989) with a crystallographic ∞ R-value of 0.199 (25≠1.9 A). The atomic model includes Table 1. Data collection and refinement statistics

residues from 82 to 135 and from 149 to 378 of SGK1 KD, one AMP≠PNP molecule, one Mg2+ ion, and 195 water molecules. The residues 136≠148 (between b3 and b39) (see Figs. 1, 2A) exhibited very poor electron density, and these residues could not be placed in the electron density. In addition, the N-terminal 23 residues and C-terminal 53 residues are missing in the structure. Most of the peptide torsion angles (99.0%) fall within the most favored regions or generally allowed regions of the Ramachandran (f,c) diagram as defined in PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. 1993). Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1.
