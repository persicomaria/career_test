Max-Planck-Stelle for Enzymology of Protein Folding Weinberg 22, 06120 Halle/Saale, Germany The 131-amino acid residue parvulin-like human peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) hPar14 was shown to exhibit sequence similarity to the regulator enzyme for cell cycle transitions human hPin1, but speci®city for catalyzing pSer(Thr)-Pro cis/trans isomerizations was lacking. To determine the solution structure of hPar14 the 1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts of this protein have been assigned using heteronuclear two and three-dimensional NMR experiments on unlabeled and uniformly 15 N/13C-labeled recombinant protein isolated from Escherichia coli cells that overexpress the protein. The chemical shift assignments were used to interpret the NOE data, which resulted in a total of 1042 NOE restraints. The NOE restraints were used along with 71 dihedral angle restraints and 38 hydrogen bonding restraints to produce 50 low-energy structures. The hPar14 folds into a ba3bab2 structure, and contains an unstructured 35-amino acid basic tail N-terminal to the catalytic core that replaces the WW domain of hPin1 homologs. The three-dimensional structures of hPar14 and the PPIase domain of human hPin1 reveal a high degree of conservation. The root-mean-square deviations of the mean atomic coordinates of the heavy atoms of the backbone between residues 38 to 45, 50 to 58, 64 to 70, 81 to 86, 115 to 119 and 122 to 128 Ê of hPar14 were 0.81(Æ0.07) A. The hPar14 model structure provides insight into how this class of PPIases may select preferential secondary catalytic sites, and also allows identi®cation of a putative DNA-binding motif in parvulin-like PPIases.

The members of the enzyme class of peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases (EC number 5.2.1.8) represent the sole example of biocatalysts directed to a slow conformational interconversion within chain segments of biopolymers. They are able to accelerate speci®cally prolyl bond cis/trans isomerizations in polypeptides of various folding states utilizing secondary binding sites to increase the binding energy of the enzyme/substrate complexes in the transition state of the conformational interconversion (Fischer, 1994; Fischer & Schmid, 1999). Although the results with the cyclophilin and the FKBP family of PPIases did not reveal a marked preference in speci®city measurements for a particular side-chain of the amino acid preceding

1004 proline when comparing the speci®city constants kcat/Km of oligopeptides, the parvulin-like human PPIase hPin1 greatly prefers phosphoserine and phosphothreonine at the amino-terminal position to proline (Yaffe et al., 1997; Ranganathan et al., 1997). Together with hPin1, the fungal PPIases Ssp1 (Neurospora crassa) (Kops et al., 1998) and ESS1(PTF1) (Saccharamyces cerevisiae) (Maleszka et al., 1996, 1997; Hani et al., 1999) form a subfamily of parvulins that share functional similarity in catalyzing pSer(Thr)-Pro isomerizations up to 103-fold better than unphosphorylated substrates. As a consequence of their role in modifying cell cycle proteins, these proteins are encoded by genes essentially involved in phosphorylation-dependent cell cycle regulation. As has been demostrated, depletion of the hPin1 homolog from egg extracts of Xenopus laevis compromised the operation of the DNA replication checkpoint in a PPIase activitydependent manner (Winkler et al., 2000). These enzymes are complementary to each other in rescuing a lethal phenotype of yeast using a ESS1 gene knock-out background. However, the lack of lethal phenotype in Drosophila having totally removed the hPin1-homolog dodo and mice lacking Pin1 indicates functional redundancy in higher eukaryotes (Maleszka et al., 1997; Fujimori et al., 1999). In conjunction with common functional properties, these enzymes contain a particular WW domain extending N-terminally to the catalytic domain. Similar to the PPIase domain the hPin1 WW domain functions as a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine-binding module, with properties similar to those of SRC homology 2 domains (Lu et al., 1999). As revealed by the X-ray structure of hPin1 complexed to both Ala-Pro and the sulphate ion, the catalytic preference for acidic residues preceding proline is probably maintained by a long loop region comprising Lys63 to Thr81, which includes several basic residues (Ranganathan et al., 1997). In addition to hPin1, a second parvulin-like PPIase has been identi®ed in a variety of human tissues as the 14 kDa human Par14 (Rulten et al., 1999; Uchida et al., 1999). It has an N-terminal tail of 35 amino acid residues, which does not show sequence similarity to a WW domain. A further characteristic feature of hPar14 is an altered substrate speci®city with preference for positively charged residues preceding proline. Knowledge is lacking concerning the molecular basis of this subsite speci®city that might reside either in the spatial arrangement of secondary binding sites or in the primary structure of the substrate chain. Furthermore, it remained an open question as to whether the N-terminal extension of the catalytic domain of hPar14 represents an independent folding unit with individual interaction capability, as was already found for the WW of hPin1. Here, the description of the three-dimensional structure of hPar14 will be presented, which gives rise to the hypothesis that a special function of the N-terminal tail is as a DNA-binding segment in

conjunction with the structure of the catalytic core, reminiscent of a FKBP-like superfold.

Results and Discussion
Assignment of resonances Residues of the 131-amino acid human parvulin hPar14 (PDB-ID 1eq3) were sequence speci®cally assigned using the classical method developed by È Wuthrich (1982) as well as by chain tracing methods based on double and triple resonance experiments listed in Table 1. The latter technique was used to assign 1H,13C,15N resonances of NH-, backbone and Hb atoms of residues Lys11 to Lys131 (BMRB-ID 4768). For assignments, the high-®eld shifted NH resonance of Lys50 was chosen as a reliable starting point. g,d,e resonances of aliphatic chains and resonances of ring systems of aromatic residues were traced using TOCSY and NOESY-like spectra. Within the PPIase domain of hParv14 (Asn36 to Lys131) amino acid residues Ala76, Arg77 and Gln78 were ambiguously assigned. Proton and carbon Ca resonances of residues Lys4 to Gly35 are poorly dispersed and cover the range of their corresponding random coil values. The residues Gly79 and Gly92 and all 15N resonances of proline residues within the sequence remained unassigned. Description of secondary structure elements within hPar14 Poorly dispersed resonances of amino acid residues Lys4 to Gly35 within the amid region of TOCSY and COSY-spectra point to the fact that these residues are localized in random coil areas. Con®rmation comes from the evaluation of NOESY spectra where only sequential NOEs of neighboring residues within this sequence were found. The N-terminal secondary structure starts with Asn36 extending to Cys45. High coupling constants (>8 Hz) and slow exchanging amide protons (Figure 1) de®ne this stretch to be a nineamino acid long b-strand (b1) followed by a short loop sequence from Glu46 to Gly49. An extended helix-loop-helix motif follows this loop area wherein a-helix 1 covers residues Lys50 to Lys59 and a-helix 2 leads from Arg63 up to Tyr71. Both helices are connected by a short loop sequence comprising only three amino acid residues (Ser60 to Met62). Helix 2 turns into a third short a-helical element (Asp74 to Arg77) interrupted by a tworesidue stretch from Ser72 to Glu73. Helix 1 and 2 are well de®ned by Ha-NHi  3, Ha-NHi  4 and Hai i i Hb  3 NOEs and slow exchanging amide protons i (Figure 1), whereas helix 3 is only poorly characterized, and can be looked at as an a-helical turn. A short loop from Gln78 to Gly79 is followed by the second b-strand leading from amino acid residues Gly80 to Met85. The unusual geometry of b2 is de®ned by coupling constants and slowexchanging amid protons of the adjacent b1-strand

(Figure 1). Residues Thr86 to Gly92 connect the second strand to the fourth a-helix (Pro93 to Leu101). From Pro102 up to Pro109 hPar14 exhibits an extended loop region leading to a third b-strand starting at Val110 and terminating at Thr118. b3 is interrupted by a four-amino acid turn-like element (Thr112 to Pro115). Beyond a short loop region (Lys119 to Gly121) b3 turns into the last strand b4 comprising residues Phe122 to Gly129. The hydrogen bond network of all b-strands of hPar14 is shown in Figure 2. De®nition of secondary structure elements was performed on the basis of Ha-NHi  3, Ha-NHi  4 and Ha-Hb  3 NOEs, slow i i i i exchanging amid protons, coupling constants, Wishart plots (Supplementary Material) and the DSSP-Programm (Kabsch & Sander, 1983). Analysis of the tertiary structure Calculation of an ensemble of 50 structures of the folded hParv36-131 was done as described in Materials and Methods. A total of 1042 NOEs, including 120 intra-residual, 397 long-range, 167 medium-range and 358 sequential NOEs, 71 dihedral angles and 38 hydrogen bonds were set as constraints in a simulated annealing procedure followed by a re®nement approach. On average, each amino acid is de®ned by about ten contacts to its spatial neighbors. However, the number of NOEs per residue is not uniformely distributed among the sequence. There are fewer constraints for some residues in the more ¯exible loop regions and in the short helical turn of residues Lys75 to Arg77. Due to the ambiguous assignment of this turn, a low number of NOEs probably re¯ects low-level accuracy more than great ¯exibility within this area. In contrast there are a few residues that are de®ned by more than 40 NOEs. Among those

amino acid residues with hydrophobic side-chains such as Ile43, Leu58, Phe64, Val67, Tyr71, Phe94, Phe122, Ile125, the histidine residues His42 and His123 can be found (Figure 3). Convergence of the family of 50 structures was analyzed by building up an ensemble through stepwise addition of individual structures in order of increasing energy (data not shown). Inspection of this plot allows identi®cation of an ensemble of 25 converged structures corresponding to a plateaux in the NOE penalty pro®le. Structural statistics and coordinate precision of the 25 favorable structures are given in Table 2. Low Vdw and NOE energies are signi®cant criteria, but are not suf®cient to ensure good accuracy of the molecular models. The quality of each member of the ensemble was additionally checked using the WHATCHECK program of the WHATIF package (Hooft et al., 1996). The rmsd value over all heavy backbone Ê atoms including the loop regions was 1.45 A and Ê . When superimposing over all heavy atoms 2.08 A the structures with regard to their secondary structure elements (Table 2) these values drop down to Ê Ê 0.81 A and 1.29 A and the ensemble gains in precision, proving that the global fold is well de®ned. Figure 4 shows an ``sausage representation'' of all converged structures where the ¯exible regions are highlighted. hPar1436-131 resembles the structure of the PPIase domain of hPin1 The global fold of hPar1436-131 (Figure 5) consists of a four-stranded twisted b-sheet gripping a-helix 4. The sheet is stabilized by the bulky residues Phe94 and Phe99 that make contacts to either Leu44, Leu82 or Ile125, thereby forming the hydrophobic core of the protein. The aliphatic side-

chains of Ile43 and Ile124 at the convex surface of the sheet are covered by the hydrophobic residues Leu58, Phe64 and Val67 of the amphiphatic helices 1 and 2. The topological arrangement of the secondary structure elements in hPar14 is identical to that of the PPIase domain of the human mitotic regulator hPin1 (Ranganathan et al., 1997), which was co-crystallized with Ala-Pro probably bound to the active site of the enzyme. Superposition of the two PPIase domains shows a striking simularity between both polypeptide segments (Figure 6) Ê with a rmsd Ca value of 2.4 A calculated by the program DALI (Holm & Sander, 1993). Despite the fact that the dipeptide might induce a more open conformation for hPin1, the backbone atoms of all four b-strands and the known a-helical regions converge within both the structures. Sites important for enzymatic activity and functionality of hPin1 can be reduced to a group of amino acid residues with functional side-chains

surrounding both the bound Ala-Pro moiety and the sulfate ion mimicking the phosphate group of speci®c substrates. Taking into account that the cocrystallized dipeptide does not represent a substrate but a competitive inhibitor of PPIase, and might cover the hydrophobic active center in a position unlike the substrate molecule, only several essential residues of both parvulins can be identi®ed by structural comparison in detail. Ranganathan and co-workers found three hydrophobic residues (Leu122, Met130 and Phe134) forming the assumed binding side for the proline ring moiety, whereas amino acid residues His59, His157, Cys113 and Ser154 are ``symmetrically distributed around the bond rotation axis'' of the dipeptide (Ranaganthan et al., 1997) and might work as a catalytic cascade for a putative nucelophilic mechanism of catalysis (Fischer et al., 1989). In addition, three basic residues (Lys63, Arg68, Arg69) are supposed to form the binding pocket for the phos-

phate group of the natural target sequence pSer/ pThr-Pro. The hypothesis that the denoted residues play a functional and critical role in the isomerization mechanism is con®rmed by the fact that the spatial distribution and arrangment of those residues in hPin1 and the corresponding amino acid residues in hPar14 are structurally conserved (Figure 7), even if the mechanism of catalysis and subsite speci®city differ. Reassessment of the alignment of parvulin sequences Looking at residues that occupy the identical spatial position in hPar14 and hPin1 allows a reassessment of the alignment of parvulin sequences from different organisms published previously (Uchida et al., 1999). It is interesting that Ser154 of hPin1, thought to contribute to the mechanism of catalyzed isomerization by hydrogen bond donation to His157 is exchanged to a phenylalanin moiety in hPar14. Instead, the conserved Thr112 in hPar14 (Thr152 in hPin1) might be capable of serving as hydrogen donor for the histidine residue,

as the distance between the hydroxyl group and Ê the imidazol ring is between 2 and 3 A. In addition, a structural comparison of both proteins shows that the hydroxyl group or the corresponding oxygen atom in position Ser111 of hPin1 (Ser72 of hPar14) seems to be sequentially and structurally conserved among the class of parvulins, and might therefore may also play a role in the catalytic mechanism. Although the topology of the PPIase domain of hPar14 resembles that of hPin1, the subsite speci®cties of both parvulins are quite different. hPin1 proved to interact speci®cally with pSer-Pro or pThr-Pro moieties in a great variety of mitotic phosphoproteins at the PPIase site, whereas a similar subset of substrates has not yet been detected for hPar14. It can be hypothesized that the different spatial distribution of functional amino acid residues within the three-dimensional fold of both parvulins would indicate af®nity for a completely different set of substrates. Besides the identi®cation of natural substrates for hPar14 the mechanism of enzyme catalysis of parvulins demands attention.

Despite the bundle of conserved (34.2 % identity and 75.8 % similarity) amino acid residues between hPin1 and hPar14 there is a striking difference concerning the role of Cys113 in hPin1. hPar14 is a member of a group of parvulins that lack this cysteine residue in their sequence. Asp74 occupies a similar position in hPar14 but instead of a sulph-

hydryl moiety it provides a side-chain oxygen atom or hydroxyl group for a possible catalytic function. This difference between the parvulins is a remarkable feature. However, the potential role of Cys113 as a nucleophil in the catalytic cycle of hPin1 remains unclear. Although mutating this residue to Ala (Ranaganthan et al., 1997) could abolish catalyzed isomerization, this observation could be explained by a local structural destabilizing or unfolding effect caused by residue exchange, rather than by a loss of the capability of nucleophilic attack by the masked cysteine SH group. Evidence of this has been raised from studies of Escherichia coli Par10 in the presence of the inactivating compound juglone (Henning et al., 1998). Furthermore, the negative charge adjacent to Cys113 in the primary structure of hPin1 and other phosphate-speci®c parvulins, represented by a Asp-Cys moiety, is mimicked by a conservative exchange forming a Glu-Asp segment in hPar14 homologs (Figure 8(a)). Keeping in mind the pyramydalization of the prolyl bound carbonyl group in the hPin1/Ala-Pro structure, polarizing potency of cumulative anionic sites might be necessary to support nucleophilic assistance to prolyl bond rotation of appropriately localized side-chains or enzyme-bound water molecules. Other residues that can serve as landmarks for the reassessment of the sequence alignment are the hydrophobic amino acid residues Pro115 and Val116 in hPar14 (Pro149 and Val150 in hPin1) followed by a charged residue in 90 % of all sequences. These pattern is structurally conserved among the family of parvulins but has no known function. An alignment of a representative number of parvulins from procar-

yotes and eucaryotes based on the structural positions, and hydrophobic or polar characters is shown in Figure 8(a). hPin1 and hPar14 differ in the loop regions and surface charges The sequence homology of hPin1 and hPar14 within the secondary structure elements and the supposed active center re¯ects the functionality of a conserved stable fold in terms of catalytic power. However, the speci®city for substrates or protein ligands in many protein families is located in ¯exible loop regions where an evolutionary exchange of a variety of different amino acid residues is used to distinguish and recognize proper target molecules. One of the best understood examples of this are the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) at the antigen-binding site of immunoglobulins (Davies et al., 1990). Comparison of the loop areas of hPin1 and hPar1436-131 could therefore shed some light on substrate speci®city and the make-up of cellular target proteins and binding partners. Interestingly, the extended region of 14 residues from Lys63 to Glu75 connecting b1 and helix 1 in hPin1 is shortend to four residues in hPar14. This part of the mitotic regulator is thought to provide the binding pocket for the negatively charged dianionic phosphate group of pSer or pThr. The three amino acid residues Lys63, Arg68 and Arg69 are localized in spatial proximity to each other, forming a positively charged surface groove that can interact with the phosphate moiety (Ranaganthan et al.,

1997; Figure 9(d)). In contrast to hPin1, hPar14 does not catalyze the cis/trans isomerization of Ser/Thr phosphorylated peptides. The difference in the surface potentials might represent a possible cause, since the positively charged groove of hPin1 is substituted for a more negatively charged area made up of Asp74 and Glu46, the latter replacing the position of Lys63 of the mitotic regulator (Figure 9(a), (d)). In addition, Figure 8(a) shows that the loop insert of about ten residues is highly conserved among the phosphate-speci®c eukaryotic parvulins, pointing out that more than only the reported three charged residues remain to be necessary for activating the whole catalytic machinery (Ranganathan et al., 1997). For hPar14 the conclusion can be drawn that a positively charged amino acid in front of proline would be favored for isomerization due to the negative surface potential, but the whole set of secondary binding sites has not yet been identi®ed. Indeed, studies on the kcat/Km value of the substrate SucAla-Xaa-Pro-Phe-NH-Np (Uchida et al., 1999) with variation in Xaa show the highest specici®ty constants for the arginine-substituted target (Kcat/KM  103 MÀ1 sÀ1). The Arg-Pro moiety seems to be a necessary but not suf®cient constituent of the natural hPar14 substrate molecule. It is suprising that low speci®ty constants for His and Lys substitutions point out that not only the positive charge but the arginine side-chain is necessary for substrate binding. Despite the differences arising from the positive loop region of hPin1, the surface composition

along the active center and the accessibility of its functional amino acid residues seem to be conserved among both parvulins (Figure 9(a) and (c)) and probably among most family members (Figure 8(a)). A more striking difference between both proteins is an extension of three residues of the loop region connecting helix 4 and the third b-strand in hPar14. A functional role for this part of the enzyme has not been discussed up to now. As can be seen from Figure 8(b) there are several hPar14-related parvulins that exhibit a similar extended loop. The long Ê distance (about 10 A) from the active center means that this area probably plays a role in the inter-

action with other biopolymers, as opposed to directly functioning as constituting the active site. A similar conclusion can be drawn from the single amino acid insertion of Asp113 in the turn interrupting b3. The aspartic acid residue is presented to the bulk water forming an anionic patch in conjunction with Asp107 despite the position of the ¯exible loop extending from Val103 to Lys108. Interestingly this area is surrounded by a hydrophobic circle built up by side-chains of residues Met55, Leu58, Met106, Pro109, Val110, Phe111, Pro114 and Met126 (Figure 9(c)). As this sticky patch is located some distance from the active center it may be a target side for docking proteins.

There are few NOEs in the spectrum that might be related to the presence of the cis-isomer of Pro114 representing native-state isomerization at this residue. This proline residue takes part in the hydrophobic cluster mentioned above. Due to this low-abundance isomer, the constraints are ambiguous, and calculations based on either cis Pro114 or trans Pro114 do not result in signi®cant differences in energy, structure and surface potential of the protein. Native-state isomerization often occurs at proline residues critical to protein function (Stoddard & Pietrokowski, 1998). Analyzing the shape of the surface of hPar14 Ê reveals a 18 A long groove from His42 towards Thr112 and His48 that might accept the polypeptide chain of a substrate in its extended conformation. This groove exhibits a kink close to the putative binding site for proline residues of substrates. A rough estimation would suppose about six to eight substrate residues reside in the active site of the enzyme during prolyl bond isomerization. A comparable polypeptide binding site was found on the surface of hCyp18 where the groove could match at least nine amino acid residues of a proline-containing HIV-1-p24 fragment. (Zhao et al., 1996). Looking at the charge distribution of the protein surface and using distance evaluating algorithms (XPLOR, InsightII), several salt bridges could be identi®ed in hPar14. In contrast to hPin1, helix 2 in hPar14 is stabilized by a side-chain interaction

between residues Arg63 and Glu66. A further feature of the structure of hPar14 is a quadrupol-like arrangement of charges on the convex site of the b-sheet (Figure 9(b)). Two salt bridges formed by Glu128 and Lys39 as well as Asp81 and Arg41 are located in close proximity to each other. In hPin1, this quadrupol is replaced by an Asp121-Arg56Glu163 triad. Parvulins feature the FKBP superfold As has been reported by Noel and co-workers, global structural similarity of FKBP12 and hPin1 can be identi®ed. The conservation of the hPin1 fold in hPar14 identi®ed in this paper leads to the several conclusions that FKBP and parvulins share a common pattern of structural motifs. Despite differences in catalytic machinery and biological function, the unique topological arrangment of important secondary structure elements within those proteins and the global fold identity in the absence of signi®cant sequence homology de®nes a superfold, and thus a FKBP superfamily. The difference in sequence homology is a measure of evolutionary distance between the family members, as was discussed in the case of the ubiquitin superfold (Orengo et al., 1994). It is interesting that the E. coli GreA transcript cleavage factor (GreA tcf; PDB-ID 1grj) shares a similar folding pattern with the FKBP proteins and therefore belongs to the FKBP superfamily as well as the parvulins.

A minimal conserved structural fold is indicated by black coloured bars (b-strand), wires (a-helix) and lines (loop and turn). Wires, bars and lines drawn in gray represent differences within individual structures.

(z-score  2.1, rmsd Ca  3.7; PDB-ID 1rlw) were found to show minor similarity to hPar14, whereas GreA tcf was not detected by the algorithm. Figure 10 shows a comparison of the secondary structure and the folding topology of FKBP12, hPin1, GreA tcf and human parvulin hPar14. Parvulins exhibit N-terminal interaction domains Beside the PPIase domain several parvulins exhibit distinct N-terminal protein interacting modules. hPin carries a WW-domain, for example, that exhibits pSer/pThr-Pro interacting sites as well as potential af®nity for poly-proline II motifs. In hPin1 and Nedd4 these domains bind to substrate molecules in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Lu et al., 1999). In contrast to hPin1, the N-terminal part of hPar14 is unfolded under conditions used for NMR experiments. The in vivo function of this tag remains unknown so far. However the strong basic character of the N-terminal domain could imply a putative DNA-binding domain. A variety of transcriptional regulators carry a basic DNA-recognition site, among which are the leucine zippers and basic helix-loop-helix proteins. A comparison of the N-terminal sequences of distinct members of both families (Busch & Sasone-Corsi, 1990) reveals a cluster-spacer-cluster motif of basic amino acid residues within these domains. The leucine zippers such as GCN4, CREB or c-jun, as well as the bHLH protein MyoD1 are particularly characterized by a short lysine or arginine stretch followed by two or three alanine residues and a second basic stretch. A similar stretch of residues could be found in the N-terminal domain of hPar14 and its counterparts in Dyctiostelium and mouse. In addition an Expasy PSORT search (Molecular Biology Server, Swiss Institute for Bioinformatics) favors a nuclear localization of the domain

(94.1 %). Therefore, it can be speculated that the hPar14 is directed to the cell nucleus where it might bind to DNA. Preliminary data from Western blot studies of nuclear cell extracts from Jurkat cells con®rm that hPar14 is located in the nucleus complexed to DNA. However, the fact that hPar14 does not have a nucleus leading sequence makes it necessary to search for a possible interacting partner translocating the protein through the nuclear pore complex. DNA binding might either be mediated by an unknown interaction partner or occur in a direct manner not only involving the 35 residue N-terminal sequence but the extension of elements of structure of the PPIase domain. Possible candidates for an interaction are Pro102 to Pro109, which are close to the N-terminal site and probably contribute to DNA binding. The question as to why a protein bound to DNA requires prolyl isomerase activity remains to be answered. As in the case of hPin1, which carries a N-terminal WWdomain contributing to substrate speci®city, the likely substrate for hPar14 could be a protein acting in DNA transcription or cell-cycle regulation. This would classify hPar14 as belonging to a family of molecular switches that turn on or off a variety of proteins involved in the transcriptional machinery.

Material and Methods
Overexpression and purification of hPar14 The E. coli M15/pREP4 clone hPTTQ (Uchida et al. 1999), which contains the hPar14 gene ligated into the vector pQE70 (Qiagen, Hilden) was used for overexpression of recombinant hPar14 protein. Expression and puri®cation of protein hPar14 was performed according to the method by Uchida et al. (1999). For isotope labeling (15N,13C), cells of a 50 ml overnight culture of the hPTTQ clone were harvested and resuspended into 50 ml of MARTEK 9-CN medium (Martek, Columbia). Expression cultures were grown in selective MARTEK 9-CN medium by inoculation of 1 l with 50 ml of adapted cells.

NMR Structure of the 14kDA Human Parvulin After induction of protein expression at A600  0.3 with 1 mM IPTG cells were shaken for a further ten hours at 37  C and harvested at A600  0.8 by centrifugation at 4  C for 15 minutes at 6000 g in a Beckmann J2-HC centrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto). Cell rupture was performed by a SLM Aminco French pressure cell (SLM Aminco, Buettelborn). The cell lysate was stirred with 0.1 % (v/v) benzonase for 15 minutes at 4  C and ultracentrifuged in a Beckmann L8 60 M centrifuge at 100,000 g for 30 minutes at 4  C. The supernatant was applied to a Fractogel EMD DEAE-650(M) column (2.5 cm Â 20 cm), equilibrated with 2 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). hPar14 passed the column unbounded and was applied to a Fractogel TSK AF-Blue column (1 cm Â 6 cm) equilibrated with 2 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). Fractions containing hPar14 were obtained by running a linear gradient from 0 M to 3 M KCl in 60 ml of 2 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). PPIase-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated with a Filtron OMEGACELL (Pall-Filtron, Northborough), exclusion size 10,000 Da. Samples (1 ml) were applied to a Superdex 75 gel ®ltration column (1.6 cm Â 60 cm) (Pharmacia LKB, Uppsala), equilibrated with 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), containing 150 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM DTE. hPar14 fractions were pooled, concentrated as described, and used for NMR-investigations.

1991) and MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996) were used for visualization. Structure calculation A family of 50 structures was calculated by a simulated annealing (SA) approach followed by a re®nement procedure using the X-PLOR-98 program package È (Brunger, 1993; Molecular Simulations Inc., USA). For calculation, slightly modi®ed slow-cooling standard simulated annealing protocols have been used. Re®nement was done against the standard covalent geometry restraints and a structural database (Kuszewski et al., 1996). Constraints resulting from NOE intensities, coupling costants and hydrogen bonds were introduced to the simulated annealing approach in a step-by-step procedure. Initially only sequential and medium-range NOEs as well as long-range NOEs de®ning the b-sheet areas and coupling constants have been used for structure calculation. All remaining NOEs and hydrogen bonds were introduced in consecutive steps. Finally the intraresidual NOEs were accepted. Back-calculation was applied during several cycles of the re®nement procedure. All structures were calculated on the basis of a repel function. Distances and dihedral angle constraints

NMR measurements NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer equipped with shielded z gradients. The temperature of all experiments was set to 300 K. Homonuclear two-dimensional experiments (TOCSY, DQF-COSY, NOESY) were acquired on unlabeled parvulin dissolved in a phosphate buffer solution in H20 as well as in 2H20 at pH 6.5. All heteronuclear two and three-dimensional experiments were performed on a uniformly 13C/15N-labeled protein. The following three-dimensional spectra were recorded: HNCA, HNCO, HN(CO)CA, HN(CA)CO, CBCA (CO)NH, HN(CA)HA, HBHA(CO)NH, CC(CO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, 13C-HSQC-TOCSY, 15N-HSQC-TOCSY, 13 C-NOESY-HSQC and 15N-NOESY-HSQC. For 13C-mixing time in the HCCH-TOCSY experiment, 22 ms DIPSI2 pulse sequence was employed. DSS was used as an internal standard for calibration of proton resonances. For 15N and 13C calibration we followed the IUPAC procedure de®ned by Markley et al. (1998). The water resonance was suppressed by applying a WATERGATE sequence (Piotto et al., 1992) or by pre-saturation. Prior to Fourier transformation all spectra were multiplied with a sine or sine bell square window function shifted by p/2 or p/4. Aquisition parameters of all experiments are summarized in Table 1. To monitor hydrogen bonding within the protein, a series of 15N-HSQC spectra was recorded 2, 8 and 24 hours after dissolving a lyophylized sample in 2H2O. HSQC resonances of slowly exchanging protons were assigned by comparing peaks to those in NOESY and TOCSY spectra recorded in 2H2O. Processing, analysis and visual representation of twodimensional spectra were performed using the NDEE program package (Biosymbiose Inc., Germany; Spinup Inc., Germany) on O2 and INDIGO workstations (Silicon Graphics Inc., USA). Three-dimensional spectra were processed and analyzed using the standard Bruker software XWINNMR and AURELIA 2.4. In addition the programs Molscript (Kraulis, 1991) and Raster3D (Meritt & Bacon, 1997) as well as GRASP (Nichollis et al.,

All NOEs were extracted from two-dimensional NOESY spectra as well as from three-dimensional NOESY-HSQCs. NOE intensities were subdivided in Ê Ê four different classes: strong (1.8 A-2.7 A), medium Ê Ê Ê Ê (1.8 A-4.3 A), weak (1.8 A-5.5 A) and in a few cases very Ê Ê weak (1.8 A-5.8 A). Center-averaging was employed for groups of equivalent spins, and pseudo-atom corrections È (Wuthrich et al., 1983) were performed prior to structure calculation using a simple home made AWK-program. To avoid overestimation of NOE intensities due to a contribution of zero-quantum coherence, all intraresidual NOEs between vicinal protons were allowed to cover a Ê Ê distance range of 1.8 A to 3.7 A. Coupling constants were ®tted either from double-quantum-®ltered COSY spectra or 15N-HSQC spectra using the Bruker XWINNMR deconvolution software. Transformation into constraints was performed according to the Karplus relationship by setting dihedral angle constraints for structure calculation to À120(Æ40)  (>8 Hz) and À60(Æ20)  (<7 Hz). Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges Exchanging protons were classi®ed into three groups: fast exchanging and therefore not visible two hours after dissolving a lyophilized sample in 2H2O; slow exchanging and still visible after eight hours but not visible any more after 24 hours, and very slow exchanging meaning still visible after 24 hours. Backbone hydrogen bonds of very slow exchanging protons were de®ned by standard parameters (Kraulis et al., 1989) setting two distance constraints between the acceptor oxygen atom and both the N and the H atom of the donor amide group. For slow exchanging backbone and side-chain hydrogen atoms only one constraint was set from the acceptor oxygen atom to the proton of the donor amide or hydroxyl group. After structure calculation we ran X-PLOR programs and INSIGHT98 (Molecular Simulations Inc., USA) routines to search for atom distances and angles favorable for hydrogen bonds and salt bridges

(Baumann et al., 1996). The selection parameters for Ê hydrogen bonds were distances below 2.6 A and N-H Á Á Á O1C angles smaller than 60  . For salt bridges Ê we chose a distance of smaller than 4 A between OÀ and N. Definition of secondary structure Wishart plot: for calculation of the chemical shift index we followed the procedure described by Wishart et al. (1992) and worked with the revised data by Wishart et al. (1995). Corrections due to amino acid residues followed by proline residues were performed. Constraints: for the characterization of the secondary structure due to distance and angle constraints we preferentially used NH-Hai,i  3, NH-Hai,i  4 and Hai-Hbi  3 (a-helices) and long-range NOEs of consecutive residues in stretched regions (b-sheet). In addition, dihedral angles and non-exchangeable NH protons were included to analyze the structural elements. The program DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983) was used to ®nd a-helices, b-sheets, turn and coil conformations.
