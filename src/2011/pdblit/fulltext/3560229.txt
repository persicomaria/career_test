Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I; EC 3.1.21.1) is a 5 0 phosphomonoester-producing endodeoxyribonuclease, which has preference for double-stranded DNA and requires both Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions and a pH value of 7.8 for optimal activity [1]. In addition to its well-known role in pancreatic digestion, DNase I appears to be involved in the fragmentation of DNA during apoptosis [2] and in the removal of DNA from nuclear antigens after cell death [3]. Human recombinant DNase I has been approved as a therapeutic for the treatment of cystic fibrosis [4], and it may be effective for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [5]. Until now, nonseparation (homogenous) assays of DNase I activity have been based on the increase in absorbance at 260 nm (hyperchromicity) upon hydrolysis of DNA [6] or the ability of certain dyes to enhance their absorbance or fluorescence when bound to doublestranded DNA [7≠10]. Hydrolysis of the DNA reduces dye binding and thus decreases the absorbance or fluorescence. However, DNase I and closely related enzymes such as DNase c (DNase I-like 3) hydrolyze doublestranded DNA preferentially by introducing singlestrand breaks (nicks) rather than by catalyzing the cleavage of both strands [11,12]. Therefore, we have developed a simple and sensitive bioluminescent assay for the nickase activity of DNase I. In the presence of excess NAD-ligase, production of DNA nicks by DNase I results in the proportional production of adenosine 5 0 -monophosphate (AMP), which is converted to ATP by adenylate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase and then back to AMP by luciferase with the release of light. As described previously, regeneration of ATP from AMP results in a cycling reaction with stable light output [13,14].

A reagent solution for the detection of DNA nickase activity consisted of 75 U/ml Escherichia coli DNA ligase (New England Biolabs M0205S), 14 lM NAD (b-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; Sigma N1511), 50 U/ml adenylate kinase (myokinase from chicken muscle; Sigma M5520), 25 U/ml nucleoside-diphosphate kinase from baker’s yeast (Sigma N0379), 250 lM dCTP (sodium salt; Amersham Biosciences 272062), 1.25 mM D -luciferin (sodium salt), 12.5 lg/ml luciferase (firefly, recombinant), and 2.5 mM dithiothreitol (all from Molecular Probes A-22066) in buffer A (25 mM Tricine, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgSO4). Bacteriophage phiX174 RF I DNA (New England Biolabs N3021S) was diluted in Buffer A at 50 ng/ll. DNase I from bovine pancreas (standardized vial containing 2000 Kunitz units; Sigma D4263) was diluted in Buffer B (1 mM CaCl2, 0.1% acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20 in Buffer A). As measured in Sigma, 1 Kunitz unit produces an increase in absorbance at 260 nm of 0.001 per min per ml when acting on highly polymerized DNA at pH 5 at 25 ∞C with magnesium ion concentration of 4.2 mM [6]. AMP (sodium salt; Sigma A1752) was diluted in Buffer B at 5 fmol/ll. Each reaction mixture (100 ll) contained 40 ll of the reagent solution, 10 ll of the DNA solution, and 50 ll of the DNase I solution. To include AMP in the assay at 250 fmol, the DNase I solution was replaced with 50 ll of the AMP solution. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature (22≠23 ∞C). At a desired time point, the luminescence was integrated over 10 s in a single-photon-counting Berthold 9509 luminometer and then corrected for the background luminescence (DNase I solution replaced with 50 ll of Buffer B) at that time point. The measured counts were directly displayed as relative light units (RLU). The components of the reagent solution were initially optimized to produce an assay of the greatest sensitivity within a 10-min incubation period. Reaction progress

curves for the bioluminescent nickase assay of DNase I are shown in Fig. 1. At 8, 80, and 800 lU, DNase I produced linear time-dependent increases in luminescence measured at 1-min intervals. When DNase I in the reaction mixture was replaced with AMP, a product of the nick-closing reaction, the luminescence increase was substantially constant over the 10-min incubation period with the decay rate of light emission less than 0.4% per min. To generate a standard curve, the luminescence increase produced by DNase I at 9.6≠160 lU was measured at 5 min of incubation. Fig. 2 shows that DNase I produced a linear dose-dependent increase in luminescence with a slope of 107 RLU/lU. In the presence of excess NAD-ligase, the quantity of AMP released should equal the quantity of nicks produced by DNase

I. When DNase I in the reaction mixture was replaced with AMP at 250 fmol, the luminescence increase was 4170 RLU. Therefore, it can be calculated that DNase I produced 1.28 fmol of ligatable nicks/min/lU in the present assay. Assays for DNA nicking that are based on gel-electrophoretic separation of the nicked DNA have been previously employed in functional studies of DNase I family enzymes [11,12]. In addition to being tedious and time consuming, such assays are not specific for the ligatable nicks but detect any single-strand breaks or gaps. In conclusion, extremely low DNase I activities could be measured in a short time with a linear continuous assay based on DNA nicking/ligation and stable luminescence output. In fact, we know of no other DNase I assay as sensitive in a short assay period. In addition to the DNase I family enzymes known to hydrolyze DNA by introducing ligatable nicks, there are restriction endonuclease-like nicking enzymes, such as N.BstNBI from Bacillus stearothermophilus [15], the activity of which can be measured with the present assay. In addition to use as a simple nickase assay, the present method should be useful for studying DNA repair pathways that ultimately lead to the formation of ligatable nicks, such as base excision repair [16].
