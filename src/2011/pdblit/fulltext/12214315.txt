Abstract: The hydration structure of human lysozyme was studied with cryogenic X-ray diffraction experiment and
molecular dynamics simulations. The crystal structure analysis at a resolution of 1.4 Å provided 405 crystal water molecules around the enzyme. In the simulations at 300 K, the crystal structure was immersed in explicit water molecules. We examined correlations between crystal water sites and two physical quantities calculated from the 1-ns simulation trajectories: the solvent density reflecting the time-averaged distribution of water molecules, and the solvent dipole measuring the orientational ordering of water molecules around the enzyme. The local high solvent density sites were consistent with the crystal water sites, and better correlation was observed around surface residues with smaller conformational fluctuations during the simulations. Solvent dipoles around those sites exhibited coherent and persistent ordering, indicating that the hydration water molecules at the crystal water sites were highly oriented through the interactions with hydrophilic residues. Those water molecules restrained the orientational motions of adjoining water molecules and induced a solvent dipole field, which was persistent during the simulations around the enzyme. The coherent ordering was particularly prominent in and around the active site cleft of the enzyme. Because the ordering was significant up to the third to fourth solvent layer region from the enzyme surface, the coherently ordered solvent dipoles likely contributed to the molecular recognition of the enzyme in a long-distance range. The present work may provide a new approach combining computational and the experimental studies to understand protein hydration.

Introduction
Proteins realize their biological functions in water. Because water is a complex fluid with unusual physical properties originating from hydrogen bond networks formed,1,2 dynamics of proteins must be under great influences of water. Thus, the interaction modes between water and proteins are subject of much discussion to understand dynamics and functions of proteins in aqueous solution.3­5 The interface structures between water and proteins (i.e., the hydration structures of proteins) and the influences of water on the dynamics and functions of proteins have been investigated through various experiments6 ­16 and database analyses.17­24

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have provided much information as to the static and dynamical pictures of the hydration structures of proteins.25­39 In MD studies, the dynamical aspects of hydration structures have been characterized in terms of the residence time and the diffusion coefficient of hydration water molecules on the surface of proteins. In addition to those conventional quantities, solvent density and solvent dipole have been introduced to characterize further hydration structures. The solvent density provides time-averaged characteristics of hydration struc-

tures and is comparable with so-called crystal water sites obtainable from X-ray or neutron crystal structure analyses.16,40 ­ 47 An MD simulation by Lounnas and Pettit, which was a pioneering work to compare the computational hydration structure of myoglobin with the experimental one, has shown that high solvent density sites are found frequently on the concavities of protein surface.32 Solvent dipole is a novel physical quantity introduced in the MD study on a DNA binding protein, phage 434 Cro.48,49 This quantity provides the time-averaged picture as to the orientational ordering of water molecules around the protein. Indeed, coherent ordering of solvent dipoles radiating from the hydrophilic surface of 434 Cro protein49 and those bridging two amino acid molecules50 are interesting in considering the interactions between biomolecules in aqueous environment. The time-averaged hydration structures from simulations have been compared qualitatively with the crystal structure at ambient temperatures as to the locations of hydration sites.32,51 However, little quantitative analysis has yet been applied over the entire hydration structures of proteins between simulations and experiments. In the previous MD study for 434 Cro protein,49 we have quantitatively compared the computed high solvent density sites with the crystal water sites. Although they were consistent, the statistical reliability still remained to be examined because of a small number of crystal water sites in the crystal structure determined at ambient temperature. Thus, toward quantitative analyses, the reliability in both the simulations and experiments should be improved. In recent years, cryogenic X-ray diffraction techniques52 have been applied to analyze the hydration structures of proteins. The technique has enabled detection of a large number of crystal water sites on the surface of proteins and provided characteristics of the hydration structures in detail as to the amount, the geometry, and networks of hydrogen bonds in hydration shells.16,53­55 Thus, this progress has improved the accuracy in detecting experimentally the crystal water sites. In the present study, we selected human lysozyme (E.C. 2.2.1.17) as a research target. This enzyme has been investigated insightfully as to the influences of hydration structures on its stability and function.41,56 We compared the time-averaged hydration structures of the enzyme obtained from MD simulations at three different ionic concentrations and from a cryogenic X-ray crystal structure analysis. The computed high solvent density sites were consistent with the experimentally obtained crystal water sites. Those high solvent density sites were characterized by highly ordered solvent dipoles. Furthermore, the solvent dipole field was stably formed around the enzyme during the simulations. Here, we report the comparative analyses and discuss the biophysical implications of the high solvent density sites and the solvent dipole ordering on the molecular recognition and propose a new scheme in investigating protein hydration.

cooling of crystals, the harvested crystals were embedded in a mineral oil, and the mother liquor surrounding the crystals was carefully removed by the tip of a crystal mounting device (Hampton Research, USA). Because one glycerol molecule sometimes bind to the active-site cleft under an antifreezing condition where glycerol at 25% (w/v) concentration existed, the oil-embedding treatment was necessary to visualize the intrinsic hydration structures of the active-site cleft (Nakasako, unpublished result). The diffraction data were collected at 100 K by the oscillation method with a Raxis-IV system (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). An X-ray generator Ultrax18 (Rigaku, Japan) was operated at 45 kV and 90 mA, and a double-mirror focusing optics system (Rigaku, Japan) was used. Cuk radiation was selected using a nickel foil. During the measurement, the crystals were exposed to cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K produced from a cooling device (Rigaku, Japan). The indexing, integration, and processing of the diffraction data were carried out using the DENZO and SCALEPACK programs.58 The crystallographic structure refinement and building of the structural models were carried out with the program X-PLOR59 and turboFRODO (Biographics, France), respectively. The initial models of human lysozyme were taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)60 (accession code 1REX61). Rounds of the ordinary refinement protocol including simulated annealing calculation were performed under a set of restraint parameters.62 Hydration water molecules were assigned from the difference Fourier Fo Fc maps by using the program FESTKOP,16,55 while taking the geometry of hydrogen bonds into account. Newly introduced portions in the model were examined with omit-annealed difference Fourier maps throughout the subsequent refinement rounds. The crystallographic and stereochemical statistics of this model are summarized in Table 1. The coordinate has been deposited in the PDB60 (accession number 1JWR). The hydration water molecules were classified into four: "inside," "contact," "first-layer," and "second-layer" classes, according to their locations relative to the solvent accessible surface63 (SAS) of protein and the crystal-contacting partners by using a suit of programs called FESTKOP.16,55 The term "inside" denotes that a water molecule is inside the SAS of the protein. A water molecule mediating crystal contacts is assigned to the contact class. A molecule interacting directly with a protein belongs to the first-layer class. The rest is assigned to the second-layer class, which has no direct interactions with protein atoms. The SAS was calculated using a probe radius of 1.4 Å radius, and the upper limits of the hydrogen bond distance and van der Waals distance were set to 3.4 and 3.9 Å, respectively.

Human lysozyme was crystallized into the orthorhombic crystal form according to the condition reported.57 Prior to the flash

Prior to the simulation of the enzyme, a 100-ps MD simulation of a liquid water system was done at 300 K and at a water density of 1 g/cm.3 In this simulation, water molecules were confined within a sphere of 90-Å diameter by applying a harmonic potential on water molecules only when they were flying to the outside of the sphere. The last configuration of this simulation was used as the solvent buffer for the subsequent simulation of the enzyme. The crystal structure of the enzyme contained 1029 heavy atoms, and 993 hydrogen atoms were generated in the starting model for MD simulation. The crystal water molecules to initiate

Therefore, the hydration-water molecules in the first-layer class cover 50% of SAS.

The enzyme and the 247 crystal water molecules were immersed in the spherical solvent buffer prepared above. In this system, the center of gravity of the enzyme was set at the center of the sphere, and the water molecules overlapping with the enzyme or the 247 crystal water molecules were removed. Three systems with different ionic concentrations were examined to analyze the influence of the ions on the protein hydration: the NOION system without ions, the ION20 system with 20 sodium and 29 chloride ions, and the ION40 system with 40 and 49. The concentrations of ions in the ION20 and ION40 systems were approximately corresponding to 0.1 and 0.2 M, respectively. The net charges of ION20 and ION40 were zero, and that of NOION was 9 electrons. The ions were set by randomly replacing water molecules, under the condition that the crystal water molecules were not replaced by the ions. The three crystal ions (Table 1) were not used in the simulation. The numbers of the water molecules were 12,024 in the NOION system, 11,975 in ION20, and 11,935 in ION40. We used the program PRESTO,64 version 3, for the MD simulation. After an energy minimization protocol, a canonical MD simulation was performed with a time step of 1 fs. A harmonic potential was again applied on water molecules that were located outside the sphere of the 90-Å diameter. No restraint was done on water molecules within the sphere, and the water molecules set at the crystal water sites in the initial MD conformation diffused freely in the sphere. The momentum and the angular momentum of the enzyme were constrained to be zero during the simulation. The potential energy of the system was calculated with the AMBER force-field parameters65 for the enzyme and ions, and the TIP3P66 potential for water molecules. The TIP3P model is simple, and reduces the computational time for the large system treated here. The long-range electrostatic interactions were evaluated with the cell-multipole expansion method,67 and the temperature of the system was controlled with the constant-temperature method.68 The SHAKE algorithm69 was applied to constrain the covalent bonds participated by hydrogen atoms. Each simulation was divided into three stages: 100-ps heating stage with a constant heating ratio from 0 to 300 K, a stage for the equilibration for 100 ps at 300 K, and a 800-ps sampling stage at 300 K. A snapshot was saved at every 0.05 ps (corresponding to 50 steps) during the sampling stage, producing 16,000 snapshots in the trajectory of each system.
Solvent Density Calculated from the MD Trajectrory

the simulation were taken from the middle stage of the crystal structure refinement, where only 247 crystal water molecules were identified in a crystallographic asymmetric unit.

In the final stage of the crystallographic structural refinement, 405 crystal water sites, 247 of which had been used in the initial MD conformation, surrounded the enzyme. The number of crystallographically independent crystal water sites was 311 among the 405 sites, and the other (405 311 94) sites were not independent ones with respect to the crystallographic symmetry. In this work, we used the electron density, X-ray, of all 405 sites to examine the correlations with the hydration structure from the simulation, because the computed hydration structure was evaluated on the entire surface of the enzyme in solution. The solvent density, MD, from the simulation was calculated using the following procedure. All of the protein conformations in the trajectory were superimposed (mass-weighted superimposition) on the crystal structure, and all solvent molecules were

simultaneously translated and rotated with the operation of the superimposition. This superimposition corresponds to defining a body-fixed coordinate system on the crystal structure. Next, the system was divided into cubes of 1 Å,3 and each water molecule in a snapshot was assigned to a cube in that the water oxygen was detected. With counting the number (Ndetect) of water molecules belonging to the i-th cube throughout the trajectory, the solvent density at the i-th cube is defined by the following equation:
MD

density to be examined. Then, we counted the number of cubes (Ncube) in that the solvent density MD was larger than , and the number of crystal water sites (Naw) that were close to, at least, one of the Ncube cubes. We judged that a cube and a crystal water site were "close," when the distance between the cube center and the site was less than 1.4 Å (corresponding to the radius of water molecule). We define the agreement score as: A rec Naw/Ncwat (4)

qi

Ndetect/Nall

(1) where Ncwat is the number of crystal water sites. When lowering the level to be included in the calculation, the larger Ncube and the better agreement are expected. Because Arec is a quantity focusing on the crystal water sites, Arec can be calculated for each class as well as ccorr: A rec class Naw class /Ncwat class (5)

where Nall is the number of all snapshots (i.e., 16,000) and qi is the position vector of the body-center of the i-th cube. The ionic density was defined by counting the detection of ions in each cube in the same way as the calculation of the solvent density. Because the number of ions was smaller than that of water molecules, we used cubes of 3 3 3 Å3 to ensure the statistics of the ion density.
Scores Measuring the Consistency between the Crystal Water Sites
MD, X-ray, and

The score precision (Apre) is simply defined as follows:49 A pre Nac/Ncube (6)

To evaluate the consistency between MD, X-ray, and the crystal water sites, we introduced a correlation coefficient (ccorr) for MD and X-ray and the agreement scores, recall (Arec) and precision (Apre), for MD and crystal water sites. The ccorr is simply defined by: c corr
MD X-ray MD 2 MD X-ray

/
2 MD 2 X-ray 2 X-ray 1/ 2

(2)

where . . . represents the average over the cubes. The cubes around the enzyme can be classified into four classes, depending on their location against SAS of the enzyme like the classification of the crystal water sites (see below). Prior to the calculation, values of X-ray were prepared in the step of the one-thirds of the resolution in the crystal structure analysis according to the Shanon's sampling theorem (see Fig. 1a). Finally, the correlation coefficient is defined among the cubes of each class: c corr class
MD X-ray class 2 MD class MD class X-ray class

/

2 MD class

2 X-ray class

(3)

where Ncube is the number of cubes defined above, and Nac is the number of cubes for that the distance to a crystal water site is shorter than 1.4 Å among the Ncube cubes. If sites with higher solvent density correlate better with the crystal water sites, then the score Apre becomes higher as increasing the density level. Thus, Arec is a quantity to compare the computational and experimental hydration structures at a low solvent density level, and Apre is that to do at a high solvent density level. Note that the classification of cubes is not the same as that of crystal water sites. Although crystal water molecules are assigned at the center of discrete peaks of electron densities X-ray, the cubes were defined in the whole spatial region occupied by solvent. Thus, the scores of recall (Arec) and precision (Apre) are quantities to judge whether the high solvent density sites agree with the crystal water sites. On the other hand, the correlation coefficient ccorr is a quantity to assess whether the patterns of the computational and experimental solvent-density maps are similar or not. Because the MD simulation was done in the monomeric state of the enzyme in solution, the contact-class cubes were free from molecular packing observed in the crystal structure. Thus, Arec(contact) and ccorr(contact) are good measures to examine the influences of crystal contacts on the hydration structures.
Solvent Dipole Calculated from the MD Trajectory

where class is "inside," "contact," "first layer," or "second layer," and . . . class represents the averaging over the cubes in a class. In calculating ccorr(second layer), we took only the cubes distant within 5 Å from the surface of the enzyme. This criterion was necessary to take into account the distinct situations in calculating density between the simulation and experiment. In the simulation, MD in regions far from the protein reached to a finite value (i.e., 0.034 Å 3 from the current simulations). In contrast, X-ray in the experiment reached zero (i.e., no detection of electron density), because we used standard deviation values in calculating the electron density. The score recall (Arec) was defined as follows.49 Prior to calculation of the score, we specified a contour level ( ) of solvent

The water molecule has a dipole moment. Here, we define the dipole of a water molecule as a unit vector pointing from the oxygen atom to the middle of the two hydrogen atoms. To obtain a time-averaged picture on the orientational ordering of water dipoles around the enzyme, we consider dipoles assigned to the 1-Å3 cubes, which have been introduced in the calculation of MD. When the oxygen atom of a water molecule is detected in a cube, the dipole of the water molecule is assigned to the cube. After summing the dipoles appearing in each cube throughout the trajectory, the sum is normalized by the number (Ndetect) of detected

water molecules in the cube. This averaged dipole over the snapshots in the i-th cube is called "solvent dipole" (d). In this study, the term "solvent dipole" is used for the time-averaged solvent dipole. Note that the solvent dipole is a quantity not moving with a diffusing water molecule, but fixed on the space. The solvent dipole in the present study corresponds to "site dipole" defined in the previous study49 to clearly express that the dipole is assigned at a spatially fixed site. The correlation between MD and d was calculated as follows: First, the norm ( d ) of solvent dipole in cubes within a given distance range from the enzyme surface was calculated. Then, cubes, for which the solvent densities were in a range [ MD, ], were classified into a group, and d was averaged over MD the cubes in the group. By spanning the density with a bin-size of ( 0.003 Å 3), the relation between MD and d was calculated.

posed to solvent tended to exhibit large RMSF, and those in the core regions exhibited a small one. The variation of RMSF, depending on the locations of residues, was similar to that of the thermal factor in the crystal structure (Fig. 1b), and the correlation coefficient between RMSF and the thermal factors was in the range of 0.55­ 0.61 Å for the three systems. The correlation coefficient of RMSF among the three MD simulations was in 0.90 ­ 0.94, indicating that the ionic strength in the range examined had little influences on the dynamics of the enzyme.
MD Trajectories of Water Molecules

Results
Crystal Water Sites of Human Lysozyme Identified at 100 K

The crystal structure of human lysozyme in the orthorhombic crystal form was refined at a resolution of 1.4 Å with statistics listed in Table 1. Although hydrogen atoms are invisible at this resolution, it is enough to compare the hydration structures as to the positions of water oxygen atoms between the crystal structure and MD simulations as described below. Figure 1a shows the experimental electron density maps used to verify the crystal water molecules in the final refinement stage. In a crystallographic asymmetric unit, 311 molecules were identified, and, as a result, 405 molecules adsorbed on one lysozyme molecule when the crystallographic symmetry was not taken into account. The amount of crystal water molecules was more than twice of that at ambient temperature. The 405 crystal water molecules were classified into four classes: inside, first-layer, contact, and second-layer classes (see Materials and Methods), depending on their location and interaction modes on the enzyme surface (Table 1). The crystal structure with 247 crystal water molecules in the middle stage of the structure refinement was prepared for the initial conformation in MD simulation (see Materials and Methods).
MD Trajectory of the Enzyme

Most of the 247 crystal water molecules incorporated into the initial MD conformation quickly diffused away from the initial sites even in the preparative stages of 200 ps in all systems. The average displacement of them from their initial positions was more than 13 Å at the end of the preparative stage in each system. Thus, when high solvent density is assigned at a site after averaging the full-length simulation trajectory, it means that a number of water molecules successively visit the site during the simulation. In contrast, a small number of the water molecules resided persistently around their initial sites with small positional displacements less than 1.4 Å throughout the simulation. These water molecules were termed as "tightly bound" water molecules and were located inside the enzyme or in surface concave (Fig. 1c). The numbers of the tightly bound water molecules after the full simulation run were three (two in the inside class and, one in the first-layer class) in the NOION system, nine (eight inside, and one first layer) in ION20, and seven (six inside, and one first layer) in ION40. These molecules distributed mainly in three regions and formed strong hydrogen bonds with carbonyl oxygen atoms in the main chain (Fig. 1c). They are presumably captured in the folding process and likely assist to assemble the secondary structures around Leu84 or stabilize the loop structures around Thr70 and Gly105.
Solvent Density Around the Enzyme

Three systems at different ionic concentrations (the NOION, ION20, and ION40 systems; see Materials and Methods) were simulated to investigate influences of ionic strength on the hydration structures of the enzyme. In any of the simulations, the structural deviation of the enzyme from the X-ray structure was saturated with a small root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). In fact, the averaged RMSD over main-chain atoms and over the 800-ps sampling was smaller than 0.8 Å, and that over all atoms was smaller than 1.3 Å. These values were in the same magnitude as those reported in other works, in which the long-range electrostatic interactions were evaluated by the multipole expansion methods70,71 or the Ewalt method.72,73 Figure 1b and c shows the magnitude of the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of C atoms. As expected, the residues ex-

Solvent density, MD, was calculated for each simulation system with eq. (1) in Materials and Methods. The average value of MD in the bulk-water region, which was defined as a region 10 ­15 Å apart from the enzyme surface, was 0.034 Å 3 for all systems and nearly equal to the experimental value (0.033 Å 3) at 293 K and 0.1 MPa. In contrast, in the vicinity of the enzyme surface, MD was significantly larger than that in the bulk solvent region, and the averaged density of cubes in the first-layer class was in the range of 0.041­ 0.043 Å 3, higher than that of the bulk region. The spatial patterns of MD were similar among the three simulation systems, as indicated by their correlation coefficients (Table 2). Figure 2a visualizes both MD in the ION40 system and the omit-annealed difference Fourier electron density, X-ray, of the crystal water molecules. Both MD and X-ray distributed over the entire surface of the enzyme, and are consistent particularly in surface grooves (a quantitative analysis for the consistency between MD and X-ray is done later). When MD was contoured at higher density levels, it split into discrete peaks, indicating that water molecules successively visited specific hydration sites. Al-

though particularly large MD values (i.e., MD 0.5 Å 3) were assigned to the tight-binding water sites, 99.9% of the peaks in 3 . In Figure 2b, the positions MD had values smaller than 0.33 Å of crystal water sites are compared with MD contoured at 0.05 Å 3. Crystal water sites likely correspond to the high solvent density sites, giving us an impression that MD may reproduce the crystal water sites or X-ray.
Comparison of the Computationally and Experimentally Obtained Hydration Structures

Figure 2 visually demonstrates a consistency between the computational and experimental hydration structures. Here, to compare quantitatively MD with X-ray or crystal water sites, we introduced a correlation coefficient ccorr [eqs. (2) and (3) in Materials and Methods], and agreement scores Arec[recall; eqs. (4) and (5)] and Apre [precision; eq. (6)]. The ccorr gives a measure of similarity between MD and X-ray. As described in the Materials and Methods section and shown in below, Arec and Apre are complementarily used to evaluate the consistency between crystal water sites and MD, depending on the level of MD. The evaluated ccorr is shown in Table 2 in each class of crystal water sites. The coefficients of the inside and the first-layer classes are in a range of 0.39 ­ 0.48, and one may get an impression that these values are small. However, when RMSF of the enzyme (Fig. 1b) is taken into account, it turns out that the correlation is good as described below. The distribution of MD and X-ray (or crystal water sites) assigned to the first-layer class cubes is inconsistent on some surface regions (Fig. 2). The RMSF of the enzyme is high in those regions. Indeed, ccorr(first layer) decreases apparently de-

pending on the magnitude of RMSF in all systems (Fig. 3), demonstrating that the simulation reproduces the crystal water sites around residues with small conformational fluctuations. For instance, ccorr(first layer) 0.7 around protein atoms with RMSF 0.3 Å, while ccorr(first layer) 0.3 around those with RMSF 1.1 Å. In contrast to these two classes, the correlation for the contact and second-layer classes were little even when taking RMSF of residues surrounded by them. Figure 4a­ c shows the variation of Arec on the solvent density level. Because of the definition, score Arec measure effectively the consistency between MD and the crystal water sites in low solvent density cutoff. The descending order of the score at the solvent density level of 0.05 Å 3 (see Fig. 2b) was Arec(inside), Arec(first layer), Arec(contact), and Arec(second layer). The value of Arec(inside) indicates that these inside class hydration sites were persistently or successively occupied by water molecules during the simulation (Fig. 1b). The Arec(first layer) was high enough to conclude that the first-layer crystal water sites in the cryogenic analysis were reproduced in the 300-K simulations. In particular, the sites in grooves and concaves of the enzyme surface positively contributed to Arec(first layer): for instance, the consistency was fairly good within the shallow grooves shown by the rectangles in Figure 2b. The small values of ccorr(contact) and the rapid decreasing of Arec(contact) on the solvent density cutoff suggest the possibility that the contact-class crystal water sites are artificially formed in the crystallization process as previously pointed out.16 The lowest score for Arec(second layer) implies that the hydration structures in the second-layer class at 100 K must be in disorder at 300 K. One may ask why ccorr(inside) was considerably smaller than 1.0 despite the fact that the crystal water molecules of the inside class were characterized by the long residence time around the MD initial positions, as already shown. However, the long residence was clearly demonstrated in Figures 4a­ c, where Arec(inside) was equal to or larger than 0.8. Remember that the classification of cubes is not the same as that of crystal water sites (see Materials and Methods). The inside-class cubes exist in the vicinity of all protein surfaces, even if no crystal water molecule is assigned around the surfaces or even if large conformational fluctuations are assigned to the surfaces. At a high solvent density level, Apre effectively measures the consistency between the crystal water sites and local high-density peaks of MD (Fig. 4d). The scores gradually increased up to the density level of 0.15 Å 3, and reached a value of 0.8 at the higher solvent density level. Thus, at the high solvent density level larger than 0.15 Å 3, about 80% of the high solvent density sites from the MD simulations are consistent with the crystal water sites.
Solvent Dipoles around the Enzyme

The solvent dipoles, d, in each system exhibited coherent ordering near the surface of the enzyme (Fig. 5a). The coherent patterns of d diverging from or converging to the enzyme surface indicate the existence of a complicated interaction field induced cooperatively by the enzyme and the hydration structure. As described in the previous section, the solvent dipole is a quantity measured on the body-fixed coordinate system on the enzyme. Therefore, the orientational motions of the water molecules are restrained when the

surface between Asn44 and Lys33, and along the grooves between Arg114 and Arg115 (Fig. 5c). Around Asp53 and Asn60, the coherent ordering of dipoles was also clear (Fig. 5e). The patterns may correlate with the constellation of polar atoms of the hydrophilic residues. Note that the patterns of MD and X-ray were similar in the area (Fig. 5d), and large solvent dipoles were found at crystal water sites with high solvent densities. On the other hand, little ordering was observed around the hydrophobic residues Tyr63, Val74 (Fig. 5e) and Val110 (Fig. 5c) located at the mouth of the cleft, indicating that water molecules hydrating those hydrophobic residues were orientationally disordered.

Averaged RMSF over enzyme heavy atoms within a sphere (radius 5 Å) from a depicted cube center is assigned to that of the cube. The correlation coefficient was the average of ccorr over cubes, the RMSF of which were in the range given in every 0.2 Å step of RMSF: ccorr(range) [ MD X-ray range MD range X-ray range]/ 2 2 2 1/2 [( MD2 range . MD range ) ( X-ray range X-ray range )]

Correlation between the Solvent Dipoles and the Solvent density

molecules come in the region with large solvent dipole, while the orientational motion is quickly randomized when they leave the region. As indicated by the correlation coefficient in Table 2, the spatial patterns of large-amplitude dipoles were similar among the three ionic concentrations, demonstrating little influence of ionic strength on the solvent dipole ordering in the range examined. The average magnitude of d rapidly decayed within the region 5 Å distant from the enzyme surface, slowly decayed in the region between 5 to 10 Å, and reached a plateau in the region more than 10 Å distant (Fig. 5b). Therefore, the influences of the enzyme on the ordering of d are effective within the three to four layers of water molecules as an average. This tendency is qualitatively similar to that in the previous study.48 The decay is a result of the loosening of the dipole pinning:50 the orientational fluctuation of a water molecule becomes larger as the water molecule being far from the enzyme. Simulation studies27,35,39,48 has shown that the solvent diffusion is restrained by protein with decreasing the protein­solvent distance, and that the diffusion coefficient in the first-layer region becomes several times smaller than that in the bulk water. Thus, the total sampling time of 800 ps in the present study is still much longer than the diffusion time of water molecules around enzyme, suggesting that the present results are statistically significant. Of course, we cannot definitely state only from the current simulations that the coherent patterns of the dipole ordering survive an infinitely long time. The current study, however, showed that the lifetime of the patterns is equal to or longer than 1 ns. In addition, the similarity in the coherent patterns among the three independent simulations means that the patterns remain around the enzyme even in simulations longer than 1 ns. The coherent patterns in the solvent dipole ordering tended to be prominent on the grooves of the surface rather than bulges. A typical example was found in the patterns around the reaction center (Figs. 5c and e). Around the reaction center Glu35, coherent patterns of solvent dipoles pointed toward the residue along the flat

As typically seen in Figure 5c and 5d, highly oriented water molecules tended to occupy hydration sites characterized by high solvent densities. In fact, a correlation coefficient between d and MD (see the last paragraph of Materials and Methods) varied, depending significantly on the level of solvent density (Fig. 6). To analyze quantitatively the correlation, the magnitude of the solvent dipole was calculated in three distance ranges from the enzyme surface in referring Figure 5b. Near the enzyme (Fig. 6a), where the ordering of solvent dipoles was significant (Fig. 5b), larger solvent dipoles were found at sites with higher solvent densities, in particular, at sites with density level larger than 0.2 Å 3. Beyond 5 Å apart from the enzyme, the ordering became weak (Fig. 6b), and it vanished in the range of 8 rpc 12 Å (Fig. 6c). This

preferential sites, because the simulation length was still too short to obtain the canonical ensemble of ionic distribution for the systems consisting of a small number of ions. The ionic density decreased in a region apart from the enzyme surface more than 16 Å (Fig. 7). This is due to a boundary effect where the outside of the solvent sphere is in a vacuum. This boundary effect shows the difficulty to accurately estimate the ionic concentration in a simulation.

Discussion
In the present study, we have approached the question of whether hydration structures in MD simulation correlate with crystal water sites or not. The results tell us that the computationally generated hydration structures are consistent with the experimental ones near the surface of human lysozyme. In addition, the ordering of solvent dipoles is significant in the hydration sites with high solvent density. Here, we discuss the implications of the present results on the dynamics, hydration, and function of the enzyme toward a better description of protein hydration.
Correlation between the Computed Solvent Density and the Crystal Water Sites

The present study demonstrates that the computed high solvent density sites are consistent with the crystal water sites in the inside and first-layer classes (Fig. 2 and Table 2). We observed a similar tendency in the previous MD simulation study on 434 Cro protein,49 although it was difficult to conclude that the consistency was statistically significant because of a small number (17) of crystal water sites in the crystal structure of the protein referred. In contrast, the present analysis was carried out with a large number of crystal water sites assigned carefully in the cryogenic structure analysis. Thus, the results shown here ensure the high quality of the simulation and the experiment.

This is due to the attractive interaction between the negative ion and the enzyme (net charge of protein 9 e). There was no clear crystal ion sites detected in the examined ionic concentration range.

The similarity between MD and X-ray depends on RMSF of the enzyme (Fig. 4). In X-ray crystal structure analyses, it is generally impossible to assign hydration sites around residues with large conformational fluctuations. However, this situation does not necessarily mean that there is no hydration site around the fluctuating regions, because the crystal structure analyses provide a time-averaged picture. When a body-fixed coordinate system is defined on the fluctuating portion, definite hydration sites may be found, as shown in the previous work.49 Thus, MD technique compensates the experimental data.
Solvent Dipoles around the Crystal Water Sites

interesting to investigate the effects of solvent dipole ordering on the dynamical rearrangements of the networks.
Dielectric Properties of Hydration Structure

Around the enzyme, the sites with high solvent density, which were consistent with the crystal water sites (Fig. 4), were characterized with large-magnitude solvent dipoles (Fig. 6a). Therefore, it should be concluded that the crystal water molecules are orientationally ordering. In addition, the ordering of the crystal water molecules restrains the orientational diffusion of water molecules surrounding them, resulting a stable coherent patterns of solvent dipoles on the enzyme surface (Fig. 5a). Therefore, the crystal water molecules likely pin or anchor the coherent patterns of solvent dipoles. As well as in our previous study,50 we term the interaction field inducing the coherent orderings of solvent dipoles "solvent dipole field." The effective distance range of the solvent dipole field was about 10 Å (corresponding to three to four layers of water molecules) from the enzyme surface (Fig. 5b), and is comparable with that of the influences of a protein on the diffusion coefficient of water molecules.48 In regions far from the enzyme surface, because the solvent dipoles with small amplitude have a little correlation among the three systems (Table 2), the solvent dipoles fluctuate largely (Fig. 6). The solvent dipole field in the distant region is induced through interactions between water molecules rather than interactions with the enzyme. Because there are no biomolecules pinning the solvent dipoles in the region, the dipoles fluctuate through rotational diffusion of bulk water molecules in a short period of about 5 ps.50 Concerning the dipole ordering, the amount of hydration water molecules of proteins estimated from the dielectric relaxation measurements12 is interesting. The estimated amount is consistent with that of the monolayer hydration expected from cryogenic crystal structure analyses16,55 and that from small-angle X-ray scattering experiments.14 This fact indicates that the adsorbing hydration water molecules on protein in solution possess dielectric properties different from those of bulk solvent.16,55 The present conclusion that the crystal water molecules are in orientational ordering may be a plausible reason to explain the consistent results between dielectric relaxation and X-ray diffraction/scattering measurements. Because the orientational correlation function of water molecules can be related to the observations from vibrational spectroscopy, the orientational motion of hydration water molecules may be elucidated experimentally in the future. In cryogenic crystal structure analyses, proteins are wrapped in large-scale networks of hydrogen bonds connecting crystal water molecules and polar protein atoms.16,55 The networks are expected to dynamically rearrange54 and to restrain the collective motion of proteins in solution through a damping effect. Therefore, it is also

When inspecting the coherent patterns of the solvent dipole field, a question arises: is the solvent dipole field in correlation with the Poisson­Boltzmann field ordinary used for discussing electrostatic interactions of biomolecules74? The answer still remains to be elucidated through further computational and experimental studies. However, at the present time, we should describe the correlations and the conflicts found between the two fields. The two fields are consistent as to the fact that both fields are strong nearby the polar atoms of proteins. However, they are qualitatively different from each other in several aspects. For instance, while the solvent dipoles around the active site point toward the reaction center in the present study (Fig. 5b), the electrostatic field vectors expected from the Poisson­Boltzmann fields of lysozyme75 probably point from the lower lobe toward the upper lobe of the enzyme. In the previous study50 on a system consisting of two amino acid molecules, we have observed a solvent dipole bridge mediating the interaction between the two molecules. It has been quantitatively shown that the bridge is considerably stronger and longer range than the Poisson­Boltzmann field. In this regard, the coherent solvent dipole filed in the active site cleft (Fig. 5) seems to assist the long-range interactions between the substrate and the enzyme. In addition, while the Poisson­Boltzmann field significantly varies with the ionic strength as expected from the formula,76 the solvent dipole field is independent of the ionic strength in the solvent system (Fig. 5b). When a space is filled by orientationally ordered water molecules, a small Kirkwood G-factor77 resulting in a dielectric constant smaller than 80, is expected in the space. Then, the electrostatic field in the space is stronger than that estimated from the Poisson­Boltzmann equation assuming a uniform dielectric constant.50 Around protein molecules, the dielectric constant varies, depending on the distribution of hydrophilic residues on protein surface, which electrostatically induce the ordering of solvent dipoles in the high solvent density sites. In addition, the complicated interactions between water molecules, for instance, diople­ diople interactions and configurational restraints due to the networks of hydrogen bonds, probably make the solvent dipole field different from the Poisson­Boltzmann field. At the moment, the dipole field has been found only in computational systems. However, the field has been found under various computational procedures. For instance, in the study on 434 Cro protein,49 the filed has been found with applying a periodic boundary condition and with an electrostatic cutoff. The field is also formed between two amino acid molecules separated to each other by 14 Å in solution,50 and has been observed in a protein­water system at different ionic conditions with using a periodic boundary condition, where the electrostatic interaction is calculated by Ewald summation (manuscript in preparation). In addition, the dipole field has been formed with two water models, TIP3P and SPC, in systems that do not contain a protein.50 In the current study, the dipole fields was formed in the protein system with the TIP3P model, which is simple, and thus, requires less computational time. Although the existence of the solvent dipole

Hydration Structure of Lysozyme

field should be examined with other water models in future work, the current results strongly suggest the existence of the filed around the proteins in the solution. The dipole field, however, has not yet been observed experimentally. In the future, we have to try experimental approaches to identify the field, for instance, through vibrational and dielectric spectroscopy on proteins in aqueous solution.
Tightly Bound Water Molecules

The tightly bound water molecules found in the MD simulation (Fig. 1b) likely contribute to the stability and folding of the enzyme. For instance, two tightly bound water molecules interacting with Asp67 and Thr70 may work to assemble S4 and the adjoining loop containing the two residues through hydrogen bond networks. Because RMSF and thermal factors indicate that the loop is intrinsically fluctuating (Figs. 1b and d), the destruction of the hydrogen bond networks may cause drastic structural changes in the loop. In fact, mutations destroying the networks cause a large-scale structural change or result a conformational disorder of the loop as observed in an amyloidgenic Asp67His78 and Thr70Ala79 variants. Therefore, the search for tightly bound water molecules through MD simulations may provide clues for speculating the site-specific contribution of water molecules in the folding and stability of proteins.
Influences of Ionic Strength on Protein Hydration

In the present simulation, the ions were introduced to assess the ionic effect on the solvent dipole field. Although the ions widely distributed around the protein (Fig. 7), they have little influences on the conformational fluctuations of the enzyme, the distribution of solvent density, and the solvent dipoles (Table 2). The dipole field may be weakened at a considerably high ionic concentration. Because protein crystallization occurs frequently at a high ionic strength, it is interesting to study the dipole field at the high concentration to address the roles of the solvent dipoles and ions in the crystallization process.
