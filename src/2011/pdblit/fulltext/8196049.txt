Abstract A phthalide ring (benzene g -lactone ring) of a colorless fluoran color former is cleaved by adding the electrophilic H . This ring becomes a benzene ring D and a carboxyl group as a colored form, and one ring of the xanthene ring skeleton performs a quinonoid form (colored form). The crystal and molecular structures of three colored forms of 2-anilino-3-methyl-6-(Ncyclohexyl-N-methylamino)-9-(o-carboxyphenyl)xanthene C34H33N2O3 ·Cl (1), 2-o-chloroanilino-6-dibutylanilino-9-(ocarboxyphenyl)xanthene C34H34N2O3Cl ·Cl (2) and 2-anilino-6-(N-ethyl-N-p-tolyl)amino-9-(o-carboxyphenyl)xanthene C36H30N2O3 ·C2H6·Cl (3) complexes were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The xanthene rings of colored forms 1­3 have coplanar geometry compared with colorless forms. The benzene rings D make small angles with the xanthene ring skeleton so that the colorless forms were almost perpendicular. The C...O contacts between the cleaved ° C(sp 3) spirocarbon C6 and two oxygens of the carboxyl group have 2.600(7)­2.842(7) A. The p electron density migration occurred from the auxochrome HCl attached to the phthalide ring to the xanthene ring. Atomic net charges of the base nitrogen N1 of side chains R 1 and R 2 indicate positive value and the charges toward N1 to C6 also indicate the alternative system. The anions Cl of 1­3 have strong N2­H...Cl contacts with the base atom N2 of R 5 side chains. 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Xanthene dyes are characterized by the presence of an xanthene nucleus and have an additional fivemembered g -lactone ring system. Several black dyes of the fluoran compounds are useful as chromogenic compounds such as thermo- and pressure-sensitive recording materials for high thermal sensitivity, high image density, and high speed recording.

applications were found in facsimiles, laser printers, labelers, automatic ticket examination machines and so on. The leuco-type thermal recording article consists of a sheet substrate coated with a coloring layer containing basic dyes (formers), color developers, sensitizers and others. Only a few fluoran colorless color formers used in thermal recording paper have been solved by X-ray crystallography [1­4]. We have reported the crystal structures of four color developers [5] and seven colorless color formers in previous articles [6,7]. The colorless compounds (Scheme 1) are widely used as color formers (lactone form). The xanthene

ring has a planar geometry, the accessibility of the electron richness or the electrophilic H such as the auxchromers leads to the electron density migration of the nucleophiles easily by the p electrons of CyO bonds. The situation is complicated around the C(sp 3) spirocarbon C6, where the rupture of the bond C6­O2 will occur easily by introducing H at C6 position. The constitution effects of color have been interpreted by perturbational theory [8] of color in basic dyes. This theory has been attributed to high electronic symmetry of the molecular systems and the p electrons of the systems approximate to isop -electronic odd alternant hydrocarbon [9]. In g -lactone contrast, a phthalide ring (benzene rings) of a colorless form is cleaved by adding the electrophilic H and this becomes a benzene ring and a carboxyl group as (colored form). Also one ring of the xanthene ring skeleton performs a quinonoid form (colored form). We could have obtained the colored compounds, 1­3, by adding the H . Only three fluoran colored forms have been solved by Xray crystallography [10,11]. Our interest focused on the stereochemistry, the steric hindrances, some electronic properties and the reactivity of these colored compounds, 1­3 compared with the colorless compounds, 4­6. To determine the geometry of these compounds, a detailed stereochemical study by X-ray diffraction and theoretical

calculations was undertaken. To discuss the color characteristics, semiempirical quantum chemical calculations for net atomic charges were performed.

2. Experimental 2.1. Materials and thermal analysis (TG and DTA) Crystals of 2-anilino-3-methyl-6-(N-cyclohexyl-N-methylamino)-9-(o-carboxyphenyl)xanthene C34H33N2O3 ·Cl (1), 2-o-chloroanilino-6-dibutylanilino-9-(o-carboxyphenyl)xanthene C34H34N2O3Cl ·Cl (2) and 2-anilino-6-(N-ethyl-Np-tolyl)amino-9-(o-carboxyphenyl)xanthene C36H30N2O3 · C2H6·Cl (3) were recrystallized as black colored prisms dissolved in 2 H -anilino-6 H -(N-cyclohexyl-N-methylamino)3 H -methylspiro[isobenzofuranon-1(3H),9(-[9H]xanthen]-3one C34H32N2O3 (4), 2 H -o-chloroanilino-6 H -dibutylanilinospiro [isobenzofuranon-1 (3H), 9 (-[9H] xanthen]-3-one C34H33N2O3Cl(5) and 2 H -anilino-6 H (N-ethyl-p-toluidino)-3 H -methylspiro[isobenzofuranon-1(3H), 9(-[9H]xanthen]-3-one C36H30N2O3 (6) in an acetone solution added with a small quantity of a hydrochloric acid by slow evaporation. We measured the melting points of colorless materials (powder and single crystal, 4­6) and these colored crystals (1­3) by thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) with a

TG-DTA320/DSC SSC5200 thermal analysis system manufactured by Seiko Electronics Co. Ltd. The measurement conditions are: temperature range 25 C­550 C, temperature speeds 10 C/min, sample weights 7 mg for powder, 4 mg for colorless and 5 mg for colored crystals, references Al2O3 and atmosphere air 200 ml/min. The melting points of powder/ colorless/colored crystals are 148 C/213 C/277 C for 1, 189 C/189 C/208 C for 2 and 213 C/212 C/205 C for 3, respectively. (Fig. 1) There are no loss in weights in colorless materials except colorless 1, but weight losses are just observed in colored crystal. These losses start gradually from 100 C and 3.1% at 277 C for 1, 2.4% at 208 C and 5.6% at 242 C for 2, and gradually from 50 C, 6.2% at 205 C and 9.8% at 246 C for 3, respectively. Two or three heat absorption peaks in DTA curves are observed in colored crystals. The melting points of powder/colorless/ colored crystals are 213 C/148 C/277 C for 1, 189 C/189 C/208 C and 242 C for 2, 212 C/212 C/ 205 C and 246 C for 3, respectively. These indicate that two different molecules having different melting points exist in the crystal. Anal. Found: for 1, C 73.1%; H 6.1%; N 5.3%; O 7.6%; Cl 6.5%.

Measurements The crystal data of 1­3 and experimental details are summarized in Table 1. Crystals of 1­3 differ from those of 4­6 in space group and cell parameters that we have reported in a previous article [6,7]. Previously crystal solvents were at the special position (1/2, y, 1/4) in a unit cell, but 1 has no solvent and has different cell parameters. Cell parameters of 1 were obtained by least-squares refinement of the setting angles of 21 reflections by the LQPARM3 program [12]. For 4, the standard deviations of cell parameters were very large values compared with others. Three standard reflections ( 1 0 6, 4 1 1, 1 2 4) for 1, (2 0 12, 4 4 5, 5 4 1) for 2, (2 0 15, 4 5 5, 1 8 2) for 3 were monitored every

The intensities of standard reflections for 2 and 3 were vibrated from 1.045 to 0.826 for 2 and were decayed 0.874 of the initial value for 3, respectively. Absorption corrections were applied for 1­3 as spherical crystals by using the ABSORP program [13] where interpolating data are taken from a

table giving the absorption correction factors [14] and the interpolation procedure as explained by Dwiggins [15]. 2.3. Structure analysis and refinement The structures of 1­3 were solved by the application of direct methods. The Shake and Bake (SnB)

program [16] developed by the Hauptman group yielded the positions for 39/40 non-hydrogen atoms (Non-H atoms) for 1. The DIRECTER3 program [12] yielded 26/41 non-H atoms for 2 and 38/41 non-H atoms for 3, respectively. The other atoms were obtained from the SEARCHER3 [12] program. The approximate coordinates were refined by full-matrix Fc h 2 least-squares to minimized w Fo h with the weight of the Cruickshank [17] w  1=a Fo h c Fo h 2 , where a  1.8 and c  0.010 for 1 and 2 and a  1.8 and c  0.014 for 3, respectively. All hydrogen atoms were located on a difference-Fourier synthesis and refined isotropically. Atomic scattering factors used in all calculations were taken from International Tables for Crystallography [18]. All X-ray diffraction computations except the SnB program running on a Sun workstation (Unix) were performed on a Compaq Deskpro 5100/5 personal computer with a DS*SYSTEM3 system. 2.4. Thermal-motion analysis To confirm the dynamic or static disorder, a thermal-motion analysis of the anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) was carried out using the THMA3 program [12,19] in terms of the LST rigidbody approximation according to Schomaker and Trueblood [20] as well as Trueblood [21], and also considering the correlations in the internal and overall motions according to Dunitz and White [22]. 2.5. Theoretical calculations

Geometries were fully optimized without any restrictions using a singlet SCF calculation on a Compaq Deskpro 5100/5 personal computer.

3. Results and discussion The skeletons of fluoran colored compounds, 1­3, have the xanthene ring (rings A, B and C), a benzene ring D, a carboxyl group cleaved the phthalide ring (benzene and g -lactone rings) and the R 5 ring (ring F). The side groups (R 1 to R 5) are just different as follows:
1 R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 Methyl group Cyclohexane ring G Methyl group H Benzene ring F 2 Butyl group Butyl group H H Chlorobenzene F 3 Ethyl group Methylphenyl Methyl group H Benzene ring F

Colored crystal molecules of 1­3 are complexes and keep the balance between a cation moiety and an anion atom Cl . The molecular structures and the conformations with the numbering of the atoms are shown in Fig. 2 and selected bond distances, bond angles, and dihedral angles compared with colorless forms 4­6 are given in Table 2. 1 In the colorless form of 4­6, 4 had 8 crystal waters, but 5 and 6 had no crystal waters in a unit cell. 3.1. Conformation

Atom­atom non-bonded potential energy calculations were carried out with the ROTEN3 program [12,23] because the variation of the side groups is very important to a steric hindrance, which makes use of a function of the type E  Ar 6 B exp Cr. Atomic charges are calculated by the method of Gasteiger and Marsili [24]. We assume that there is no geometrical change during the rotation of a fragment, and the Coulombic energy is neglected. Also we have undertaken a semiempirical quantum chemical calculation with PM3 [25] making use of widely available procedures to obtain net atomic charges. A semiempirical PM3 calculation was done with the CS MOPAC program package [26].

The xanthene rings of 1­3 are almost coplanar and ring junctions A/B, B/C and A/C are less than 12 (2.2(2) ­11.9(2) ). The dihedral angles between two mean planes of the skeleton (ring A O1 C6 and ring C O1 C6) are 3.3(1) to 8.4(1) . The maximum deviations from the xanthene ring ° (rings A, B and C) are small ( 0.076(5) A (C4) for ° ° 1, 0.081(4) A (C3) for 2, 0.169(14) A (C9) for 3, respectively). The phthalide ring exists in colorless

form cleaved to a benzene ring D and a carboxyl group in a colored form. The ring junctions B/D are also small (66.2(3) ­83.4(2) ) compared with colorless forms (87.9(1) ­89.6(1) ). The ring puckering parameters according to Cremer and Pople [27] and displacement asymmetric parameters (DAPs) defined by Nardelli [28] are shown in Table 3. The QT and Ds of the rings B are smaller compared with the colorless form. The ring B of 1 indicates good symmetry, two atoms C28 and C31 adopt from the mean plane of ring ° G( 0.652(19) and 0.624(12) A, respectively), the ring G forms the chair conformation, and the average ° bond length and the bond angle is 1.518(13) A and 111.7(6) , respectively. Although the bond lengths C5­C6 and C6­C7 are extended in the colorless

form, the bonds N1­C2, C1­C13, C3­C4 and C5­ C6 of colored forms indicate a double bond length, and the bonds and angles of rings A to C indicate normal values. The temperature factors of the ° carboxyl group O3(Beq  15.7(8) A 2) and C24­ ° 2) of the benzene C25(Beq  10.8(10) and 15.4(16) A ring F for 1, C34­C35 (Beq  12.3(8) and ° 13.5(11) A 2) of the butyl group for 2, and C37­C38 ° (Beq  15.8(10) and 15.8(12) A 2) of ethyl (crystal water) for 3 are three times larger than the xanthene ring skeleton. The bond lengths of C6­C14 (between the ring B and the ring D) are a little shorter (0.004­ ° 0.028 A) than the colorless form. The torsion angles around of N2­C9 and C6­C14 have opposite signs compared with colorless form and torsion angles

around C6­C14 for 1 indicate opposite signs with 2 and 3. 3.2. Thermal-motion analysis Table 4 lists the ADPs for the attached rigid groups (ARGs). Results of the rigid-body test done by Hirshfeld's method [29] indicate that the ADPs are of poor quality; differences in the mean square displacement amplitudes (DMSDAs) along the bonded direction (esd. for DMSDAs are ° 0.007­0.012 A 2) are larger than s (ADP) (the ° mean s (Uobs)s are 0.004 A 2). The analysis is complicated by the large agreement indices RwU and strong correlation at room temperature. The principal axes of the L and T tensors correspond to librational motions about the bonded direction and to the translations, from the molecular center of mass which correlate strongly with the rotation to keep the atomic displacements. These are distributed evenly over all of the important degrees of freedom. For 1­3, the largest principal axis of the L1 tensor compared with L2 and L3 indicates that almost all librational motion is parallel to the bonded direction and is quite anisotropic. The large principal axis T1 tensor indicates the existence of large translational motion about the bonded direction which is closely isotropic. That is, large T1 and T2 tensors (T1 tensor is the motion of the bonded direction and T2 tensor is the direction of motion of first atom) exist about the bonded direction. The large overall mean square libration amplitudes f 2 mean that thermal motions vary freely. For 1, the ring F indicates the existence of large rigid-body and internal motions and the ring F has also rigid-body motion. For 2, two butyl groups and the ring F have small motion. For 3, the ring F and the methylphenyl group indicate small f 2 values, and the large f 2 value of the ethyl group is based on the vibration of ARGs atoms because of the translation along the internal motions. For 1 and 3, the side chains R 1 (CH3 and C2H5) and R 2 (C6H11 and C6H4CH3) differ little, but the rigid-body and internal motions differ largely. 3.3. Theoretical calculations Fig. 3 shows the potential energy profiles with the van der Waals energy for the rotation of the molecular

moiety around the N1­R 1, N1­R 2 and N2­C22 (R 5) directions. Solid lines are calculated at one molecule and dashed lines are in the crystal. The energy values are relative to the energy corresponding to the observed conformation in the crystal. For 1, the rotation of R 1 (methyl group) about N1­C34 permits a rotation of 0 ­180 freely (Fig. 3(a)). The rotation of R 2 (ring G) about N1­C28 direction indicate that the energy barriers have unifold patterns, and are high narrow owing to a steric hindrance caused by the other moiety (Fig. 3(b)). The peak profiles upon the rotation of R 5 (ring F) about the N2­C22 direction permit one side rotation from 125 to 65 (Fig. 3(c)). For 2, the rotation of R 1 (butyl group) about N1­C28 direction is the same as that of R 2 (butyl group) about N1­C32 (Fig. 3(d) and (e)). The former is free to move while the latter is restricted in the crystal. The peak profiles upon the rotation of R 5 (ring F) about the N2­C22 direction also permit one side rotation from 100 to 35 (Fig. 3(f)). A little peak near 30 is caused by the steric hindrance between H24 and H26. For 3, the peak profiles upon the rotation of R 1 (ethyl group) about the N1­C28 direction differ to that of R 2 (methylphenyl) about N1­C30 (Fig. 3(g) and (h)). The former is moved freely from 145 to 50 while the latter is restricted from 30 to 30 in the crystal. The peak profiles upon the rotation of R 5 (ring F) about the N2­C22 direction also permit one sided rotation from 110 to 40 (Fig. 3(i)). The crystalline conformations of 1­3 are exactly coincident with the potential energy minimum. The energy barriers of R 1 and R 2 show that one is wide and the other is narrow and energy barriers of R 5 permit one sided rotation owing to the repulsive interactions with the other moiety. For colored forms 1­3 and colorless forms 4­6, atomic net charges are calculated by PM3 and shown in Table 5. The calculations of colored forms are performed to optimize the cation moiety, an except anion atom Cl , to a transition state with a keyword CHARGE  1 and colorless forms optimize the molecule with no keyword. In colored forms, the charges of N1 indicate plus and the charges from N1 to C6 (N1­C2­C3­C4­C5­C6) indicate the odd alternant system defined by Griffiths and Pender [30].

C1) in colorless forms are small, charges around the C6 (C5, C6, C7 and C14) of colored forms have almost the same values ( 0.19 to 0.17 eV) and the two atoms C20 and O3 cleaved from the g -lactone ring have maximum (0.42­0.40 eV) and minimum ( 0.39 to ­0.33 eV), respectively. The ionization potentials of 1­3 take the same values (10.90­11.20 eV) and these values are larger than the values of colorless form. The bond distances and angles calculated by PM3 seem reasonable. 3.4. Crystal packing The packing diagrams of the compounds, 1­3, are illustrated in Fig. 4. Hydrogen bonds and intermolecular X­H...Y contacts such as those reported by Taylor and Kennard [31] are shown in Table 6. For ° 1, the shortest intermolecular distance is 3.015(5) A

There are three C­H...Y contacts (C18­ ° ° H18...O3(2.45(5) A), C21­H21a...N2(2.83(5) A), ° C21­H21b...N2(2.80(6) A)) in a molecule and inter° molecular contacts 2.41(5) A (N2­H(N2)...CL(2 x, y, z)) are very short compared with van der Waals ° radii (2.95 A). The carboxyl group COOH (C20, O2 and O3) intermediates between C11, C18, C27 and C34 atoms, and an anion Cl (CL) has contacts between C21, C29 and N2 atoms. These contacts extend along the a axis and relate centers of symmetry. For 2 and 3, molecules cross over 1/4 of the b axis and are related by 21 screw axis along the a axis. The shortest intermolecular distances are ° 3.273(8) A (O3...C27( 1 x, y, z)) for 2 and ° 3.190(8) A (O3...C28 ( x, 1/2 y, 1/2 z)) for 3,

By existing the g lactone ring, the xanthene ring skeleton and the benzene ring D were distorted and these dihedral angles were at nearly right angles (87.9 ­89.6 ). The dihedral angles between the ring B and the

benzene ring D in the colored forms become small 68.2(2) ­83.4(2) rather than the colorless form and the distortions of the xanthene ring and the ring D are lightened. Especially small values QT and D2 of the rings B indicate the symmetry is improved compared with colorless forms. This is also seen the ring G of 1. The bond lengths of C5­C6 and C6­C7 of colorless

The bond lengths, angles and displacements of the xanthene ring become normal or small values and are relaxed from the distortions. These results are agreed with Nakatsu et al. [10]. The temperature factors at the side group R 1 and R 2 of colorless forms had shown to be normal in the case of the number of carbon less than 2 (methyl or ethyl groups) or six-ring (benzene or cyclohexane rings) and large vibrations in long 4 carbons (butyl group) where the bond lengths of these C­C are short and long alternately. However, large temperature factors of colored forms are observed in atom O3 (Beq  ° 15.7(8) A 2) for 1 in the carboxyl group and the

° benzene ring F (Beq  10.8(10) A 2 at C24 and ° 2 at C25) for 1, the butyl group C34 and 15.4(16) A ° C35 (Beq  12.3(8) and 13.5(11) A 2) for 2, and crystal ° ethyl C37 and C38 (Beq  15.8(10) and 15.8(12) A 2) for 3, respectively, There values exceed three times than that of the xanthene ring, but there is no disorder in colored forms. The shortest intermolecular ° ° distances are N­H...Cl (2.41(5) A for 1, 2.30(5) A ° for 3). An anion Cl has also C­ for 2, 2.42(5) A H...Cl contacts with C21 and C29 atoms for 1, C1 atom for 2, and C31 and C38 atoms for 3, and stabilizes two molecules with each others related centers of symmetry.

O3 atoms will easily become an electron donor and acceptor, respectively. Extensive charges (electronrich) of starred positions, caused by the electron donor groups, are indicated by the quality of the bathochromic and hypsochromic shifts (electron-poor) at the unstarred positions, and are caused by the electronic acceptor groups. All starred (active) positions in colored form (quinonoid form) increase in p electron density and all unstarred (inactive) positions show a corresponding decrease. That is, the ring A of the xanthene ring skeleton indicates the double bond features and performs a colored form (quinonoid form). 5.

from N1 to C6 and C6 to C20. The xanthene ring skeleton of colorless forms has a planar geometry, the situations around the C(sp 3) spirocarbon C6 are complicated, where the accessibility of the electrophile H with the auxchromers (HCl) leads to the electron density migration of the nucleophiles by the p electrons of a CyO bond (colorless form). The rupture of the bond C6­O2 occurred easily by introducing H at the C6 position and the oxygens O2 and O3 are polarized negatively. The spirocarbon C6 is the basis of the disengagement from the bond C(sp 3)­O by the electrophilic H . That is, N1 and

The maximum distances from the mean plane of the xanthene ring for colored forms are as small as three ranged rings and compared with colorless forms. The dihedral angles between the ring B and the benzene ring D become small (68.2(2) ­83.4(2) ) rather than colorless forms of nearly right angles, and the distortions of the xanthene ring skeleton and the ring D are lightened. The bond lengths of N1­C2, C1­C13, C3­ C4, C5­C6 and C6­C7 form double bonds. In the case of a hydroxy-substituted acid xanthene dye, the color cannot be explained by the lactone form (colorless form), whereas it can be by the quinonoid form (colored form). A color forming reaction from the

lactone form to quinonoid form is reversible and the images disappear if they come into contact with ester such as plasticizer or organic solvents. The xanthene ring has a planar geometry, the rupture of the bond C6­O2 will occur easily by introducing H at C6 position and the oxygens O2 and O3 cleaved from the g -lactone ring are polarized negatively. The spirocarbon C6 is the basis of the disengagement from the bond C(sp 3)­O by the electrophilic H . That is, N1 and O3 atoms will easily become an electron donor and acceptor, respectively. All starred (active) positions in quinonoid form (colored form) show an increase in p electron density and all unstarred (inactive) positions should show a corresponding decrease. The shortest intermolecular distances are N­H...Cl , and an anion Cl has also C­H...Cl contacts to stabilize two molecules each other and performs molecular networks with X­ H...Y contacts.
