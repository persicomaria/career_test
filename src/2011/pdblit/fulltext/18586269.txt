Abstract The PutA flavoprotein regulates proline metabolism in Escherichia coli by performing two distinct functions. First, in the cytoplasm, PutA represses transcription of the put (proline utilization) regulon. Second, PutA associates with the membrane to oxidize proline to glutamate using discrete proline dehydrogenase and D1 -pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase domains. Here, we identify a proline analog that will be useful for testing the role substrate binding has in regulating PutA functions. L -Tetrahydro-2furoic acid (L -THFA) was found to display simple competitive inhibition of proline dehydrogenase activity in PutA (apparent Ki ¼ 0:2 mM) and to perturb the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) absorbance spectrum upon complexation to PutA. At pH 7.5, a reduction potential (Em ) of )0.089 V for the FAD/FADH2 couple in L -THFA-complexed PutA was determined by potentiometric titrations. The Em value for L -THFA-complexed PutA is 12 mV more negative than the Em for uncomplexed PutA (Em ¼ À0:077 V, pH 7.5) and corresponds to just a twofold increase in the dissociation constant of L -THFA with PutA upon reduction of FAD.

The two-step conversion of proline to glutamate in bacteria is dependent on the multifunctional proline utilization A protein (PutA),1 which is a peripherally membrane-bound enzyme that contains proline dehydrogenase (PRODH, EC 1.5.99.8) and D1 -pyrroline5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH, EC 1.5.1.12) domains. PutA from Escherichia coli, the subject of this study, is a single polypeptide of 1320 amino acids and purifies as a homodimer with an apparent molecular mass of $293 kDa [1­5]. The PRODH and P5CDH domains in PutA have been localized to residues 340­ 590 and 650­1130, respectively, by primary structural

analysis with distinct mitochondrial PRODH and P5CDH enzymes, which in eukaryotes are encoded by separate genes [5]. In the first step of proline oxidation, the PRODH domain of PutA catalyzes the transfer of two electrons from proline to a noncovalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to generate D1 -pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) and reduced FAD [3,6]. Electrons from reduced FAD are then passed to the membrane electron transport chain in a subsequent oxidative half-reaction [3,7­9]. In the second step, P5C is hydrolyzed to c-glutamic acid semialdehyde, which is then oxidized to glutamate in a NAD-dependent reaction catalyzed by the P5CDH domain [3,4,7]. In addition to its enzymatic activities, PutA is a transcriptional repressor of the put (proline utilization) regulon, which houses the putP (Naþ /proline transporter) and putA genes [1,10,11]. PutA functions as a repressor by binding to the put intergenic control DNA to inhibit the transcription of the putP and putA genes, which are transcribed in opposite directions [4,12­14]. Recently, a truncated PutA protein that contains only residues 1­

669 (PutA669 ) was shown to have PRODH activity and FAD and DNA binding properties similar to those of full-length PutA, demonstrating that the DNA binding domain is in proximity to the PRODH domain [15,16].

The mechanism by which PutA switches from a transcriptional repressor to a membrane-bound enzyme has been studied by assessing the effects of proline on PutA macromolecular associations with put intergenic DNA and membrane vesicles. These studies have demonstrated that PutA intracellular location and function is regulated by the availability of proline. In the absence of proline, PutA is situated in the cytoplasm and functions as a transcriptional repressor [4,12]. When proline becomes available PutA associates with the membrane to catalyze the oxidation of proline to glutamate [9,14,17,18]. Because proline reduces FAD, the FAD redox state is implicated as a critical component in the regulation of PutA. To gain a better understanding of PutA regulation, we seek to dissect the regulatory roles of the FAD redox state and proline binding by utilizing electrochemical methods and proline analogs. We have probed the effects of the FAD redox state on PutA­ DNA interactions by spectroelectrochemistry and have shown that the reduction of FAD causes only a twofold increase in the dissociation constant of PutA with the put intergenic DNA [19]. To complement our electrochemistry studies, we are searching for proline analogs that competitively inhibit PRODH activity in PutA and do not reduce FAD. In the first study with purified PutA from E. coli, Scarpulla and Soffer [6] tested various compounds for inhibition of PRODH activity and identified L -lactate (Ki ¼ 1:4 mM), D -lactate (Ki ¼ 2:1 mM), and pyruvate (Ki ¼ 3:3 mM) as competitive inhibitors. Lactate inhibition of PRODH activity in mammals has been proposed to have a physiological function in which lactate levels modulate the rate of proline degradation in response to alternative fuel sources [20]. Discovery of other PRODH inhibitors has come from studies using solubilized PRODH activity from hepatic mitochondrial extracts. PRODH inhibitors have been sought to control the tsetse fly, a transmitter of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African sleeping sickness. In tsetse flies, L -proline is stored at high concentrations in flight muscles and is the sole source of energy during flight making inhibition of PRODH a plausible strategy for grounding the insect [21,22]. From studies with mitochondrial extracts, 3,4-dehydroproline was identified as a competitive inhibitor of PRODH activity (Ki ¼ 0:16 mM); however, it appears that 3,4-

dehydroproline is also a substrate for PRODH and is oxidized to pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid [23]. 4-MethyleneL -proline was also observed to inhibit PRODH activity in mitochondrial extracts but the inactivation kinetics were consistent with mechanism-based inhibition [24]. Here, we report the screening of five proline analogs (Fig. 1) for competitive inhibition of PRODH activity in PutA. We found that L -tetrahydro-2-furoic acid (L -THFA) is the most effective inhibitor of the compounds tested and has a binding affinity for PutA about sevenfold stronger than that of L -lactate. The binding of L -THFA to PutA is shown to significantly perturb the UV-visible spectrum of FAD but to only slightly influence the thermodynamic behavior of PutA. We propose that L -THFA will be a valuable proline analog for investigating the regulation of PutA by substrate binding. Materials and methods Materials. L -Proline and buffers were purchased from Fisher Scientific. L -Lactic acid, D L -2-pyrollidone-5carboxylic acid, 2-furoic acid, D L -pipecolinic acid, and D L -, D - and L -THFA were purchased from Sigma­ Aldrich. cis-5-Methyl-D L -proline was synthesized as previously described by catalytic hydrogenation over platinum oxide of D1 -2-methylpyrroline-5-carboxylic acid and its purity was checked by 1 H NMR [25]. P5C was synthesized as reported earlier and quantitated using o-aminobenzaldehyde [26­28]. Pyocyanine was prepared by photooxidation of phenazine methosulfate. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Fermentas. The pML9 construct was a generous gift from J. Wood (University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada). All experiments used NanoPure water. Preparation of PutA. The pML9 construct created by Ling and Wood, which contains the putA gene, was modified by positioning a NdeI site at the translation

start codon and an EcoRI site immediately after the stop codon. The NdeI and EcoRI sites were introduced using synthetic oligonucleotides and the QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis kit. The putA gene was then subcloned into a pET23b vector carrying a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (Novagen) and introduced into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS. PutA was expressed and purified with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag by Ni2þ NTA affinity chromatography as reported previously for PutA669 [15,16]. The C-terminal hexahistidine tag was retained after purification. After the Ni2þ NTA column, PutA was applied to a Q-Sepharose column and eluted as previously described. Purified PutA was dialyzed into 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10% glycerol and stored at )70 °C. The concentration of PutA was determined spectrophotometrically with a molar extinction coefficient of 12,700 MÀ1 cmÀ1 at 451 nm and by using the BCA method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard [18]. Inhibition and dissociation constants. Potential inhibitors of PRODH activity in PutA were screened by measuring the percentage inhibition of PRODH activity in assays containing inhibitor (80 mM) relative to assays with no inhibitor. PRODH activity was measured using the proline:dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) oxidoreductase assay which was performed in 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0) at 25 °C and contained 200 mM proline [7,18]. One unit of proline dehydrogenase activity is the quantity of enzyme that transfers electrons from 1 lmol of proline to DCPIP/min at 25 °C. P5CDH activity was determined by monitoring the reduction of NADþ at 340 nm. Stock solutions of each inhibitor were made in 1 M Tris buffer and adjusted to pH 8.0. In the inhibition kinetic studies with L -THFA, concentrations of proline and THFA were varied from 10 to 300 mM and from 0.01 to 2 mM, respectively. All assays were performed in triplicate and the average rate was used for the data analysis. The dissociation constants of L -THFA and L -lactate to oxidized PutA were determined by spectral titration. UV-visible spectral changes of PutA upon addition of inhibitors were recorded with a Cary 100 spectrophotometer. Titrations of PutA ($70 lM) with inhibitors were performed in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 25 °C under anaerobic conditions using a 2ml glass cuvette with a rubber septum. Solutions were made anaerobic by degassing with several cycles of argon. At each inhibitor concentration, PutA was allowed to equilibrate for 5 min prior to recording the spectrum. After correcting the spectra for dilution, difference spectra were generated by subtracting the spectrum of PutA in the absence of inhibitor from the spectrum of PutA recorded in the presence of inhibitor. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression assuming one independent inhibitor-binding site per PutA monomer.

Spectroelectrochemistry. Potentiometric measurements of PutA in the absence and presence of L -THFA were performed as previously described under an argon atmosphere using a three-electrode single-compartment spectroelectrochemical cell containing a gold wire working electrode, a silver/silver chloride reference electrode, and a silver wire counter electrode [19,29]. Potentiometric titrations of PutA were performed at 25 °C in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing methyl viologen (0.1 mM) and ferrocyanide (0.1 mM) as mediator dyes and pyocyanine (Em ¼ À0:04 V, pH 7.5) (5 lM) and indigo disulfonate (Em ¼ À0:109 V, pH 7.5) (2­5 lM) as indicator dyes. PutA concentrations were typically around 30 lM. In the experiments with L -THFA-complexed PutA, the L -THFA concentration (20 mM) was about 100 times larger than the measured dissociation constant (0.24 mM) and the PutA concentration was substantially lower ($30 lM) to achieve more than 95% saturation of PutA. To obtain clean protein spectra in the potentiometric experiments, spectra of the mediator and indicator dyes were obtained in the absence of PutA at the same measured potentials. The dye spectra were then subtracted from the spectra of the PutA sample at each measured potential. The dye subtractions were observed to affect the UV-visible spectra of PutA in the 300- to 350-nm region as indicated by variable isobestic points during the titration. The absorbance at 451 nm was used to monitor the amount of oxidized and reduced FAD. Equilibrium of the system in the potentiometric experiments was considered to be obtained when the measured potential drift was less than 1 mV in 5 min; this was typically 1­2 h. All potential measurements are reported relative to the standard hydrogen electrode and were determined in both the oxidative and the reductive direction. The reduction potentials (Em ) and n values were calculated from the Nernst equation (Eq. (1)), E ¼ Em þ ð0:059=nÞ logð½oxÞ=½redÞ; ð1Þ

where E is the measured equilibrium potential at each point in the titration and n is the number of electrons transferred. Typical error in the determination of reduction potentials is Æ5 mV. All reduction potentials exhibited Nernstian behavior as indicated by their n values.

Results The compounds listed in Fig. 1 were screened for inhibition of PRODH activity in PutA by determining the relative decrease in PRODH activity. D L -THFA inhibited PRODH activity by 94% and was clearly the best candidate of the compounds tested. The relative inhibition of PRODH activity observed with the other compounds was 65% (2-furoic acid), 32% (D L -2-

pyrrolidine-5-carboxylic acid), 2% (cis-5-methyl-D L proline), and 0% (D L -pipecolinic acid). Thus, analogs with substituents at carbon 5 (e.g., cis-5-methyl-D L proline) or a six-member ring size (e.g., pipecolinic acid) did not effectively inhibit PRODH activity nor were they found to be substrates for PutA. These observations demonstrate the size and shape limitations in the PRODH active site of PutA. The inhibition of PRODH activity by D L -THFA was then analyzed further using the separate THFA enantiomers. Fig. 2 shows a Lineweaver­Burk plot of the inhibition of PRODH ac-

tivity in PutA by L -THFA. The inhibition profile observed in Fig. 2 is consistent with competitive inhibition. Km and kcat values for PutA of 100 mM proline and 12 sÀ1 , respectively, were determined from the Lineweaver­Burk plot (Fig. 2) in the absence of L -THFA. These kinetic parameters agree with values reported previously for PutA [16]. An inhibition constant (Ki ) of 0.2 mM for the inhibition of PutA by L -THFA was then determined from linear regression of a plot of apparent Km versus L -THFA concentration using a competitive inhibition model (plot not shown). A Dixon plot of 1/ velocity versus L -THFA concentration also yielded an apparent Ki of 0.2 mM for the inhibition of PutA by L THFA. In identical experiments, a Ki of 2.6 mM was determined for the competitive inhibition of PutA by D THFA. The 10-fold higher inhibition constant of D THFA compared to L -THFA demonstrates the preferred stereochemistry in the PRODH active site. We next evaluated whether L -THFA binding to PutA causes perturbations in the UV-visible spectrum of FAD. Upon the addition of L -THFA to PutA, the UVvisible spectrum of FAD became more resolved (Fig. 3A). The changes in the FAD spectroscopic properties are shown in difference plots (Fig. 3A; inset, upper panel) of uncomplexed PutA and PutA in the presence of increasing L -THFA concentrations. Complexation of L -THFA to PutA leads to an appearance of a shoulder at 474 nm, a slight blue-shift in the main FAD absorbance band from 452 nm (e452 ¼ 12; 700 MÀ1 cmÀ1 ) to 449 nm (e449 ¼ 14; 074 MÀ1 cmÀ1 ) and a decrease in

absorbance at 381 nm. A dissociation constant (Kd ) of 0.24 mM was determined for L -THFA binding to PutA (Fig. 3A; inset, lower panel) by monitoring the absorbance changes at 478 nm during a titration of PutA with L -THFA. The binding properties of L -THFA to PutA were compared to L -lactate, which is a known competitive inhibitor (Ki ¼ 1:4 mM) of PutA but its effects on PutA spectroscopic properties have not been reported [6]. Fig. 3B shows that similar to L -THFA, the binding of L lactate to PutA causes an increase in absorbance at 451 nm to a new maximum at 446 nm (e446 ¼ 13; 955 MÀ1 cmÀ1 ) and a decrease in absorbance at 381 nm. The overall resolution in the FAD absorbance bands in the presence of L -lactate is less than that induced by L THFA complexation to PutA. A Kd of 1.8 mM for the binding of L -lactate to PutA was determined by monitoring increases in absorbance at 470 nm during a titration of PutA with L -lactate (Fig. 3B; inset, lower panel). Thus, both kinetic inhibition and dissociation constant measurements show that L -THFA has binding affinity for PutA about sevenfold higher than that for L lactate. No reduction in the FAD UV-visible spectrum was observed during a 30-h incubation of PutA with L THFA (40 mM) or L -lactate (40 mM) under anaerobic conditions, demonstrating that they are not substrates for PutA. As anticipated, L -THFA and L -lactate displayed no inhibition of P5CDH activity in PutA confirming that they bind exclusively to the PRODH active site. The redox properties of PutA complexed with L THFA were then studied to determine whether the

presence of L -THFA in the PRODH active site perturbed the reduction potential of FAD in PutA. Fig. 4 shows a potentiometric titration of PutA performed in the presence of 20 mM L -THFA and 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Reduction of PutA complexed to L -THFA proceeded without significant stabilization of semiquinone species, which is similar to that observed previously with uncomplexed PutA (Fig. 4). From a Nernst plot (Fig. 4, inset) an Em of )0.089 V was determined for PutA complexed to L -THFA and a slope of 28 mV was obtained that is near the theoretical value of 29.5 mV for a two-electron transfer. In earlier work, an Em value of )0.076 V was determined for uncomplexed PutA (70 mM Tris, pH 7.6) [19]. To more accurately assess the influence of L -THFA on the redox properties of PutA, we repeated the potentiometric titration of uncomplexed PutA in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Under these conditions, an Em value of )0.077 V (slope ¼ 37 mV) was determined for uncomplexed PutA (data not shown). Thus, the reduction potential for L -THFA-complexed PutA is 12 mV more negative than the reduction potential for uncomplexed PutA. Accordingly, the binding strength of L THFA to the reduced form of PutA (Kdred $ 0:55 mM) is estimated to be twofold weaker than that to the oxidized form of PutA (Kdox ¼ 0:24 mM).

Discussion In this work, we have identified L -THFA as a new competitive inhibitor of PRODH activity in PutA and have shown that its binding to the PRODH active site is stronger than L -lactate. The structural similarities between L -THFA and L -lactate include a carboxylate group and an oxygen atom attached at carbon 2 (see below).

Potentiometric titration of PutA (29 lM) in the presence of L THFA (20 mM) in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) at 25 °C (curves 1­7; fully oxidized, )0.062 V, )0.077 V, )0.088 V, ).096 V, )0.103 V, and fully reduced, respectively). The inset is a Nernst plot of the potentiometric data from which a reduction potential (Em ) of )0.089 V was determined.

The important role that these groups have in forming ionic and hydrogen bonds in the PRODH active site is seen in the three-dimensional structure of PutA669 ,  which was recently solved to 2.0-A resolution with lactate bound in the active site. The carboxylate group of lactate is bound by three basic active site residues, Lys 329, Arg 555, and Arg 556, which demonstrates that the carboxylate group is critical for the binding of lactate to PutA (Tanner, personal communication). The obvious structural difference between L -THFA and L -lactate is the five-member ring structure of L -THFA formed by

two additional methylene groups (carbons 4 and 5). The absorbance spectrum of FAD is better-resolved in the presence of L -THFA than in the presence of L -lactate (Fig. 2), indicating that L -THFA binding causes a larger increase in the nonpolar environment of FAD [30]. Thus, it appears that the overall binding of L -THFA (Kd ¼ 0:24 mM) to the PRODH active site is stronger than that of L -lactate (Kd ¼ 1:8 mM) mainly because of increased hydrophobic interactions from the two additional methylene groups in THFA. Also, the energy difference (1.2 kcal/mol) between L -THFA and L -lactate binding to PutA is similar to the energy estimated ($1.6 kcal/mol) for the transfer of two methylene groups to a hydrocarbon solvent, suggesting that improved hydrophobic binding strength can account for the enhanced binding of L -THFA to PutA [31,32]. In this study, we did not observe reduction of FAD during incubation of PutA with L -THFA, which indicates that L -THFA is not a substrate for PutA. Although the mechanism of proline oxidation by PutA is not known, insights into why L -THFA is not a substrate can be gained by considering an oxidative mechanism similar to D -amino acid oxidase. D -Amino acid oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of amino acids to imino acids most likely via a hydride transfer of the substrate aC­H to the N(5) position of FAD [33,34]. Replacement of the proline secondary amine with an oxa substituent in THFA introduces a more electronegative group and upon removal of a hydride at carbon 5 would form an oxonium ion. Thus, the oxa group makes THFA unsuitable for a hydride transfer from carbon 5 to the N(5) of FAD in PutA. We anticipate that L -THFA will be a valuable proline analog for studying the regulatory mechanism by which PutA switches from a DNA-binding protein to a membrane-bound enzyme. Because L -THFA does not undergo turnover with PutA, only one species of ligand is present which will make thermodynamic studies more defined. Thus, we will be able to assess the role substrate binding has in modulating PutA macromolecular associations. In this report, we have shown that L -THFA binding has only a small effect on the reduction potential of the FAD in PutA. This demonstrates that substrate binding does not have a regulatory effect on the FAD redox properties and agrees with a previous observation that the addition of a proline/P5C (1:1 ratio) mixture to PutA does not influence the measured potential of the FAD (unpublished data). Work is in progress to determine whether L -THFA binding influences PutA­DNA and PutA­membrane interactions.
