Azurin Blue copper protein Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Electron transfer Histidine `H NMR spectroscopy

1. INTRODUCTION The unusual spectroscopic properties of the blue copper proteins, such as azurin and plastocyanin, have attracted much attention [ 1,2]. The success of spectroscopic methods in predicting the coordination environment of the copper could be assessed on publication of the crystal structures of a plastocyanin [3] and an azurin [4,5]. It appears that in poplar plastocyanin, the Cu-atom is coordinated by two histidines (residues 37 and 87), a cysteine (Cys 84) and a methionine (Met 92) in a distorted tetrahedral configuration 131. Although the resolution of the crystal structure of azurin is somewhat less, the data suggest that the Cu is coordinated by two histidines (His 46 and 117) a cysteine (Cys 112) .and a methionine (Met 121), again in a distorted tetrahedral configuration. Possible contributions from other ligands, e.g., from the peptide backbone, could not be completely excluded [5]. The information provided by the crystal structure determinations has been invaluable in allowing a more detailed interpretation of the spectroscopic data, not least that obtained from high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. An important goal for all these studies is to relate the structures of the proteins to their functions. The question of the mechanism and control of the electron transfer in these proteins is still unanswered. Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin can exist in a low and a high pH form the latter being at least 2 orders

of magnitude slower in exchanging electrons cytochrome c-555 than the former. The redox potential of the `inactive' form is 60 mV lower than that of the `active' form, indicating a stabilization of the Cu(I1) state towards high pH [6-81. The transition from active to inactive state involves deprotonation of the histidine [6] which was shown in NMR studies [9- 121 to participate in a slow proton-exchange process. In a recent NMR study [ 131 this residue has been assigned to His 35, which is adjacent to the ligand His 46 [4,5]. We wish to report the results of some NMR experiments on Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin which may shed some light on the influence of temperature and pH on the structure of the active site of the protein.

AND METHODS

2. I. Protein purification
Pseudomas aeruginosa azurin was prepared according to standard procedures [ 14,151. The puritied protein was dialyzed against Hz0 and stored at 4°C after lyophilization. Solutions of azurin (l-2 mM) were made up in 20 mM phosphate buffer in D20, through which nitrogen or argon had been passed.

persulphate solutions were kept at 0°C during the experiments to slow down decomposition. The pH of the solution was varied by adding small amounts of 1 M solutions of DC1 or NaOD in D20. The pH of the sample was measured with a Pye-Unicam pH-meter, and quoted pH*-values are meter readings not corrected for the deuterium isotope effect. Azurin concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically by determining the absorbance of the oxidized species at 625 nm (&625 = 5700 mol -' . cm - ' 1161). 2.3. NMR experiments NMR spectra were measured on the Bruker 300 MHz NMR Spectrometer of the Oxford Enzyme Group. Standard deconvolution procedures were used to process the FID signals 1171. A slight amount of dioxane was added to the sample to serve as an internal reference, but shifts are quoted with respect to TSS.

from the methyl group of an aliphatic residue which is far (3 20 A) from the Cu atom [ 131. The data in fig. 1 demonstrate therefore, that it is peak 5 and not R4 that is affected by slight oxidation, indicating that peak 5 derives from a residue very close to the copper. Secondly, under conditions where peak 5 has its maximum intensity (low pH and temperature, vide infra) the area under R4 and peak 5 together accounts for 5.7 f 0.3 protons, compatible with the assignment of peak 5 to a methyl residue. Finally peak 5 has the appearance of a singlet as

3. RESULTS

AND DISCUSSION

3.1. Assignment of resonancesfrom the histidine and methionine ligands In order to analyse the effect of pH and temperature on the active site, the resonances of the Cu ligands have to be identified in the NMR spectrum. Fig. 1 shows low-field and high-field portions of the `H NMR spectrum of Cu(I)azurin. The non-ligand histidine residues have been assigned in [9,11,12]. Those we associate with the C-2 and C-4 protons of the ligand histidines are labelled l-4 in fig. 1. They appear as singlets in Hahn spin-echo spectra and are most sensitive to slight oxidation of the copper (see fig.1). The chemical shift differences between the C-2 and C-4 proton resonances are unusually small (0.04 and 0.07 ppm) for both ligand histidines. In the lH NMR spectra of plastocyanin, the corresponding differences are 0.41 and 0.69 ppm, which, although larger than in the case of azurin, are also outside the usual range of 1.0-1.5 ppm [ 121. We presume that binding of the histidines to the Cu(I) is responsible. We had assigned resonances to 5 of the 6 methionines in azurin, with the sixth unaccounted for [ 121. We now assign peak 5 (see fig. 1) to the missing methionine on the basis of the following evidence: In the spectrum of the reduced azurin peak 5 overlaps with a resonance, R4 [ 12,131, which is derived 288

expected for a methyl methionine resonances. The CH3-resonance from methionine amino acid residues usually occur in the region of 1.5-2.0 ppm and assignment of peak 5 to a methionine therefore implies a relatively large upfield shift for this resonance. A similar upfield shift has been reported for the ligand methionine in plastocyanin [ 181. Inspection of the crystal structure of azurin [4,5] (fig.2) shows that the methyl group of Met 121 is sandwiched between the planes of Phe 15 and His 46, above the center of the Phe 15 ring. It is likely that the ring current of Phe 15 will shift the methyl resonance of Met 121 significantly upfield. A nuclear Overhauser experiment confirms the proximity of the residue associated with peak 5 to residue Phe 15 [13]. Thus we assign peak 5 to ligand Met 121 and peaks l-4 to ligand His 117 and 46. We have no information on the resonances associated with the fourth ligand, Cys 112. 3.2. pH and temperature effects There is a marked difference in the effect of pH and temperature on peaks l-4 and peak 5. Whereas peaks l-4 are unaffected by pH and temperature an increase in pH* from 4.6-8.2 causes (tig.3) a considerable reduction in the intensity of peak 5. In order to avoid denaturation at high temperature, and loss of resolution at low temperature, only a limited range of temperatures could be investigated, Nevertheless a decrease in intensity of peak 5, although not as large as when the pH is raised, accompanies an increase from 30-50°C. This can be seen in fig.4 by comparing the height of peak 5 with the height of neighbouring multiplets. In relation to those the intensity of peak 5 increases by - 30% when the temperature falls from 50-30°C. In contrast to this the peaks 3 and 4 show only small shifts (of the order of 0.01 ppm) when the temperature is changed from 20-50°C or the pH* is varied between 4.5-8.5. The behaviour of peak 5 is typical of that of a residue undergoing increased motion at higher temperature and higher PH. Inspection of fig.2 shows, that rotation around, for instance the C,-SS or CD-C, bond, will cause the terminal methyl group of Met 121 to move through the anisotropic field produced by the ring current of Phe 15. An order of magnitude estimate based on a simple model of the ring current dipolar field [ 191 shows that a librational motion around the C,-SS bond, 290

with an amplitude of 10-20" may easily cause a variation in the chemical shift of the methyl protons of the order of 0.5 ppm. Broadening of the NMR signal ensues if the characteristic time of the libration is of the order of 3 10 - 2 s. It is important to note that the conditions which induce broadening of the Met 121 CHJ-signal (high pH and temperature), are also the conditions which favour the formation of the redox-inactive form of the azurin 161.As mentioned in section 1, the transition from active to inactive form has been shown to be connected with deprotonation of His 35. We suggest that the movement of Met 12 1, as reflected in the behaviour of peak 5, and the deprotonation of His 35, are interconnected. The fact that both processes occur on the same time-scale is consistent with this idea. How are these two processes connected? It is clear that increased motion of Met 121 must go together with a change in the disposition, either dynamically or statically, of Met 121 with r )ect to the copper. s bond, while not Even rotation around the C,-

affecting the equilibrium Cu-S distance, would change the orientation of the sulfur u and r orbitals with respect to the metal. The simplest explanation is that in the high-temperature, high pH-form the methionine is no longer coordinated to the copper. Fig.2 shows that an increase in the Cu-S (Met) distance might be compensated for, in part, by an increased interaction of the copper with the backbone of peptide 45 on the opposite side of the Cu. (Interaction may occur with either the carbonyl or the peptide nitrogen, since the crystallographic data allow for two orientations of the peptide, related to each other by a 180" flip-over.) This would presumably lead to a stabilisation of the copper(H) protein relative to the reduced form with a consequent reduction in the formal potential. Backbone

involvement in the coordination of the Cu has been suggested [5,20]. It would provide an explanation for the occurrence of an unusual carbonyl C NMR spectrum of reduced resonance in the I3 azurin [IO], which titrates with a pK - 7, the same pK with which His 35 titrates. In considering how deprotonation of His 35 might be relayed to Met 121 it is important to realize that these data do not indicate whether the relay is effected via the Cu atom or through a change in peptide conformation. A conformational change in the tight loop containing 3 of the 4 ligand residues (roughly extending from residue 112-122) .might change some of the constraints that preserve the tetrahedrally distorted conformation around the Cu (41. Another possibility is that the deprotonation of His 35 is relayed to a neighbouring Cu ligand, His 46 in this case, and that this causes a redistribution of charge around the Cu leading to a change in the structure of its coordination sphere. The question how the relay between His 35 and His 46 might operate requires additional comment. The unusual proton exchange kinetics of what we now know to be His 35, could be related to a process involving the simultaneous breakage and formation of different hydrogen bonds by the same histidine 161. Fig.2 further shows [4,5], that His 46 and the carbonyl of Asn 10 are in a good position to form a hydrogen bond. An inspection of the density map, of azurin indeed reveals a continuous density from NE2 of His 46 to the carbonyl oxygen of Asn 10. Fig.2 further shows that, with a slight reorientation around its C&B and C+Z, bonds, His 35 could form hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyls of residues 88 and 44. According to the mechanism envisaged in 161,at high pH His 35 would deprotonate presumably at the NE2 position, which would then be available for hydrogen bonding with His46. Published 13C NMR evidence [lo], however, indicates that His 35 deprotonates at the N81 and not at the Nc2 position, as required by this mechanism. Alternatively, it is possible that His 35, although less ideally placed than His 46, could compete with His 46 for hydrogen bonding with Asn 10 (see tig.2), especially when rotated slightly around its C-C and C+Z, bonds. In this manner it could influence the charge distribution in His 46 and thus the charge distribution around the Cu. Since protonation of His 35 will affect its ability to form hydrogen bonds, it will also influence its 291

ability to compete effectively with His 46 for hydrogen bond formation. According to this model the switch from redoxactive to redox-inactive state involves some kind of shuttling motion of the imidazole ring of His 35. In one position it would be accessible to water molecules and protonation could take place; in other position it would be inaccessible for outside water molecules but would be available for hydrogen bonding. The slow proton exchange of His 35 then might be connected with this motion of the imidazole ring. To summarize: the effect of temperature and pH on the NMR spectrum of Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin suggests that the switch from the redoxactive form to the redox-inactive species is initiated by deprotonation of His 35 and is accompanied by a lengthening, perhaps breaking of the Cu-S (Met 121) bond. We expect that a further study of the effects of temperature, pH and degree of reduction on the NMR spectra will provide more insight into the mechanism by which the change in redox activity is brought about.
