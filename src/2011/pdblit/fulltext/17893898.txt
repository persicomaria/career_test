1 2 5-Chloromethyl-2,2'-bipyridine 1 was synthesized from 2-bromopyridine and 2-hydroxy-5-methylpyridine as reported[1]. To a solution of diethyl acetaminomalonate (9.36 g, 43.1 mmol) and NaOEt (2.93 g, 43.1 mmol) in EtOH (80 mL, anhydrous) was added compound 1 (7.06 g, 34.6 mmol). The reaction mixture was heated to reflux overnight. Solvent was evaporated in vacuo and the residue was purified by silica gel flash column chromatography (Hexane ­ EtOAc, 2:1 to 1:1; then CH2Cl2 ­ MeOH, 8:1) to give 2 as a white solid (12.7 g, 96%). 2: Rf = 0.4 (silica gel, 10:1 CH2Cl2:MeOH); 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3):  = 8.76 (d, J = 5.0 Hz, 1 H), 8.35 (s, 1 H), 8.32 (dd, J = 22.0, 8.0 Hz, 2 H), 7.81 (dt, J = 8.5, 2.5 Hz), 7.29 ­ 7.32 (m, 1 H), 6.60 (s, 1 H), 4.20 ­ 4.40 (m, 4 H), 3.74 (s, 2 H), 2.07 (s, 3 H), 1.31 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 6 H); ESI-MS: m/z 386 (M + H+).

2 3 A suspension of compound 2 (12.6 g, 32.7 mmol) in aqueous HCl (85 mL, 37 % in water) was heated to reflux overnight. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo to give 3 [2] as a white HCl salt (11.4 g, 99%), which was used in subsequent biological experiments without further purification.
Construction of libraries of MjTyrRS mutants. Plasmid pBK-JYRS[3] encodes the wild-type MjTyrRS under the control of E. coli GlnRS promoter and terminator, a kanamycin resistant marker and a ColE1 origin of replication. To construct the plasmid DNA library encoding a large number of MjTyrRS variants, alanine mutations were first introduced at the intended randomization sites by overlap extension PCR[4]. Several fragments were first amplified by PCR from pBK-JYRS (vide infra). These fragments carried the intended alanine mutation(s) and sequences that overlapped adjacent nucleotides. The products were then purified by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose/TAE gel, diluted, combined, and subjected to overlap extension PCR with two flanking primers JX035NdeI (5'GAATCCCATATGGACGAATTTG-3') and JX045PstI (5'-TTGAAACTGCAGTTATAATCTCTTTC-3'). The final fragment was digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and PstI, gel-purified, and ligated back into the pBK vector to afford plasmid pBK-JYRS-ALA which encodes the inactive alanine-mutant of MjTyrRS. Using pBK-JYRS-ALA as the template and doped oligonucleotide primers containing NNK codon(s) (vide infra), the same procedures described above were repeated to introduce the randomized triplet codon (NNK) at the intended mutation sites. The ligation products (pBK-lib1) that encode library-1 of MjTyrRS variants were then electroporated into E. coli DH10B cells (Invitrogen). Electroporated cells were recovered in SOC medium for 60 min at 37°C, and then transferred into a 2 L 2YT medium with kanamycin (50 µg/mL) and were incubated at 37°C to OD600nm ~1.0. To calculate the library size, 1 µL recovered SOC culture was removed and was subjected to serial dilutions in 2YT, and then plated on LB agar plates with kanamycin (50 µg/mL) and grown overnight in a 37°C incubator. Based on the colony numbers on these plates, library-1 contained approximately 1.04 × 109 independent transformants. DNA sequencing of 20 clones did not reveal any significant bias at the randomization site. Plasmid DNA (pBKlib1) that encodes the MjTyrRSs library was then purified from the amplified 2YT culture by QIAfilter Maxiprep Kit, and used in the subsequent genetic selections whose protocols were described elsewhere [5]. The following primers (all from 5' to 3') were used together with the terminal primers (JX035NdeI and JX045PstI) to introduce alanine or NNK mutations (triplet codons underlined) in the construction of pBK-lib1: JX036Ala: TACCACTTGGTTCAAAACCTATCGCAGCAGATTTTTCATC; JX037NNK: TACCACTTGGTTCAAAACCTATMNNAGCAGATTTTTCATCTTTTTTTAAAACCTCTC; JX038: GGTTTTGAACCAAGTGGTAAAATAC; JX039Ala: CTCCTTTCTGGTTTAAATAGGCCGCTAAATCAGCCAACGCTATAATTATATCAAATCCAGC; JX040NNK:

CTCCTTTCTGGTTTAAATAGGCMNNTAAATCAGCCAAMNNTATAATTATATCAAATCCAGC; JX041: GCCTATTTAAACCAGAAAGGAG; JX042Ala: CCAACTGCAACATCAACGCCCGCATAATGAATCGCATTAACCGCCATTATTGGATAGATAACTTC; JX043NNK: JX044: CCAACTGCAACATCAACGCCMNNATAATGAATMNNATTAACMNNCATTATTGGATAGATAACTTC; GGCGTTGATGTTGCAGTTGG. The terminal primers and primers to introduce NNK mutations were purified by PAGE. The primers to introduce the alanine mutation were used directly without purification. PfuUltra high fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used for all PCR reactions according to the manufacturer's protocol. Library-2 and library-3 of MjTyrRS mutants were generated using the same strategy. Z-domain seqence. MTSVDNXINKEQQNAFYEILHLPNLNEEQEDAFIQSLKDDPSQSANLLAEAKKLNDAQAPKGSHHHHHH X-ray crystallographic analysis of the BpyAlaRS1/BpyAla complex. DNA fragment encoding the mutant synthetase BpyAlaRS1 was inserted into the NdeI/XhoI sites of expression vector pET22b to afford plasmid pET22b-BpyAlaRS1. This plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) competent cells (Stratagene). The expression and purification of the mutant synthetase followed a similar protocol to that described in previous work[6]. BpyAlaRS1 crystals were grown by hanging drop vapour diffusion method with a 1:1 mixture of ~15mg/ml protein and mother liquor containing 100 mM Tris (pH 7.5-9.0), 5% PEG8K, 16-20% PWG300 and 10% glycerol at 22ºC. X-ray diffraction data of BpyAla were collected at beamline 5.0.3 of the Advance Light Source of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory at a wavelength of 1.0 Å to a maximum Bragg spacing to 1.97 Å. The data were reduced and scaled using the HKL2000 package. The structure of BpyAlaRS1 was solved by molecular replacement using wild type M. jannaschii tyrosyltRNA synthetase (pdb entry as 1J1U) as a search model in which water molecules and other heteroatoms were deleted and processed by Amore of the CCP4 package. Structure refinement was carried out by the combination of Refmac5 of the CCP4 program suite and the CNS program suite. In the refinement process, the program coot in the CCP4 program suite was used for model building, ligand and water finding, and real space refinement of side chains and zones. Biphenylalanine was used as the initial ligand to fit into the difference electron density map at the active site. After all the water molecules were modeled, the ligand was changed to BpyAla in which two pyridine nitrogen atoms were assigned on the basis of their close contact to two water molecules that make strong hydrogen bonding interactions.
