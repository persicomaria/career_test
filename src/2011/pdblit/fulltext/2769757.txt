The three-dimensional X-ray structure of human a-lactalbumin, an important component of milk, has been determined at 1.7 A (@17 nm) resolution by the method of molecular replacement, using the refined structure of baboon a-lactalbumin as the model structure. The two proteins are known to have more than 90% amino acid sequence identity and crystallize in the same orthorhombic space group, P2,2,2. The crystallographic refinement of the structure using the simulated annealing method, resulted in a crystallographic R-factor of 0.209 for the 11,373 observed reflections (F 2 2o(F)) between 8 and 1.7 ir resolution. The model comprises 983 protein atoms, 90 solvent atoms and a bound calcium ion. In the final model, the root-mean-square deviations from ideality are 0.013 A for covalent bond distances and 2.9" for bond angles. Superposition of the human and baboon u-la&albumin structures yields a root-mean-square difference of 0.67 g for the 123 structurally equivalent C" atoms. The C terminus is flexible in the human cc-lactalbumin molecule. The striking structural resemblance between a-lactalbumins and C-type lysozymes emphasizes the homologous evolutionary relationship between these two classes of proteins.

1. Introduction
a-Lactalbumin (a-lac$) is a globular protein secreted in the lactating mammary gland and has a relative molecular mass of 14,200. It regulates lactose biosynthesis by modulating the specificity of trans-golgi galactosyltransferase (GTase) (Hill & Brew, 1975). Comparison of amino acid sequences (Brew et al.: 1970; Findlay & Brew, 1972), gene sequences (Uandekar & Qasba, 1981; Hall et aZ., 1982) and the exon-intron organization of the genes (Qasba & Safaya, 1984) firmly established that a-lac is homologous with C-type lysozymes having evolved by divergence from a common ancestor. a-lac is a metalloprotein (Hiraoka et al.,1980) t Author to whom all correspondence should be addressed at: Department of Biochemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, England.

X-ray crystallographic studies of baboon a-lac to 1.7 A (1 b = 0.1 nm) resolution have revealed a novel calcium binding loop and confirmed that in the native state, a-lac and C-type lysozyme have closely similar three-dimensional structures (Stuart et al., 1986; Acharya et al., 1989). The amino acid sequence of baboon a-lac has not yet been completely determined, although it is known to be closely similar to that of human a-lac (R. Greenberg, personal communication; Table 1) and the crystallographic refinement of the baboon a-lac structure was carried out using the human a-lac arpino acid sequence as a starting point. Omit maps calculated during the course of baboon u-lac refinement indicated eight putative sequence changes (Acharya et aE., 1989; and see Table 1). Meanwhile, suitable single crystals were obtained for human a-lac and we present here the crystal structure of

Materials and Methods
(a) (irystallization

Pure human a-lac was provided by Dr Richard Lyster. Reading IYnivrrsity. England. The crystallization was carried out using the protocol described by Fenna (1982). The crystals were grown from a solution containing protein at 30 mg/ml in @l M-1,4-piperazine diethane&phonic acid. 10 mM-CaCl, in 1.8 M-ammonium sulphate (pH 65) at 37Y!. The crystals reached maximum size after 15 days and grew in the form of sheaves of elongated parallelopiprds. A single crystal segment' of @5 mm x 0.5 mm x @3 mm in size was cut and used for the collection of X-ray diffraction data. The crystals belong to orthorhombic space group p2,2,2. with unit cell dimensions a = 33.6 B, b = 69.4 A and c = 47.3 A (for baboon a-lac, pP,2,2 space group, a = 35.5A, b = 69.1 A and c = 461 A). These parameters agree with those reported by Fenna (1982: space group P2,2,2; a = 33.6 A, b = 69.9 L4 and c = 47.3 A). There are 4 molecules in the unit cell (i.e. 1 molecule/asspmetric unit).

against the X-ray data, at various resolut' ion shells. the crystallographic R-factor1 dropped to a minimum of ti30 at 3.0 a resolution. At this stage it, was difficult to improve the fit to the experimental dat,a. The refinement was halted and a fresh start made using the MERLOT package of molecular replacement programs (Fitzgerald, 1988). The initial search was done using the baboon a-lac et al.. 1989) (excluding water protein model (Acharya molecules) with human a-lac amino acid sequence changes incorporated into the baboon z-Iace structure. The Crowther (1972) fast rotation function procedure yielded 1 significant peak at, a = 95.0" /3 = 9OW, 1: = 85.0" 1.70 . . above any other peak in the map and 5Oa above the mean of the map. No other peak in the map was greater than 65% of the maximum peak. The Lattman rotation funcztion (Lattman & Love, 1970) gave refined rotation angles of a = 95.0" fl = 88.0" y = 85.0" Thesca angles from the , , . rotation search were then used in the translation function (Crowther & Blow, 1967). The rotation function solution with the highest correlation peak gave a single, self consistent set of translation vectors on the Harker s&ions. The molecular replacement solution corresponded to a slight movement of the molecule in the cell, as will brl discussed below.

(d) Refinement The molecular replacement model co-ordinates were fed into the constrained-restrained least-squares reciprocal space refinement program, CORELS (Russman. 1985). In the refinement, reflections from %O to 3.0 A were used. Thirty cycles of CORELS refinement lowered the &factor from 044 to @40. The resultant structure was further refined using the program X-PLOR (Briinger. 1989). Ten refinement (initially with an rounds of atomic positional overall H-factor and during later stages with individual B-factors) were performed. Initial refinement utilized only energy-csrystallographic least-squares minimization and was similar in strategy to the procedure described by Jack & Levitt (1978), but with the energy parameters of X-PLOR. For individual atomic B-factor refinement, the target standard deviations for bondrd atoms and for atoms linked by 1 other atom were 1.0 to 1.5 and the actual values for the final model were 1.7 and 2.3. respectively. Following convergence. difference electron density maps with amplitude coefficients 21F,I - IF,:1 and lYOl- IE' ,I were used as guides for manual changes in the model. A bound calcium ion was identified at' this stage as a strong feature in the electron density map and was included in the refinement. After each round of refinement. model checking was done using the program FRODO. The electron density for the C-terminal region of the model was poor from the beginning of refinement as it was for the baboon a-lac structure (Acharya et al., 1989). Residues Lps122 and Glu123 are disordered and no unique structure could be defined. As the refinement progressed. solvent molecules were located with the aid of lEb\ IF,1 maps and were included in subsequent rounds of refinement. The solvent molecules that were selected were those that made reasonable hydrogen bonds with either the protein atoms or other solvent molecules. All atoms were given an occupancy of 1.0 and an initial thermal factor (B-fartor) of 20.0 A2 for protein atoms and 30+0 A2 for the solvent atoms. At this stage, the model was subjected to simulated annealing followed by molecular

X-ray intensity data to 1.7 A were collected at 15°C' on a Nicolet Imaging Proportional Counter Area Detector (XENTRONICS) using a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode X-ray generator source, with @3 mm x @3 mm effective source size operating at 50 kV, 60 mA with a copper anode: h' radiation , was selected using a graphite monochromator crystal. The limiting collimator aperture was 0.5 mm diameter. The detector was placed 8 cm away from the crystal and at a 20 swing angle of 30" Data . frames of 02" oscillation were collected with exposure times of 100 s each for a total angular rotation of 240" . Only 1 crystal was used for the data collection and it was translated after 20 h of exposure. The data frames were and reduced using the XENGEN software indexed package written by Howard et al. (1987). A total of 49,811 observations were merged to give 13,485 unique reflections between 30 and 1.7 A (95% complete) with a merging &fartor ($,,,t) of 5.S" on int,ensities (1/sig(I) = & 23.0). (c) Molecular replacement

The crystals of baboon a-lac and human a-lac belong to the same orthorhombic space group, P2,2,2 and appear almost isomorphous (mean fractional isomorphous difference = 0.28). First, all the human a-lac amino acid changes (Hall et al.. 1982) were modelled into the baboon a-lac X-ray structure (with the aid of molecular graphics program FRODO (Jones, 1978, 1985) implemented on an Evans and Sutherland PS390 eolour graphics modified by J. W. Pflugrath, M. Saper, R. Hubbard & P. R. Evans). To start with, a simple rigid body R-factor minimization of this model was performed using the crystallographic refinement program X-PLOR (Briinger et al., 1987, 1989; Briinger. 1988, 1989) implemented on a Convex 210 mini super computer. After 20 cycles of energy minimization

The final refined model consists of the protein with 90 solvent molecules and 1 calcium ion. The refinement converged with an R-factor of @209 for 11.373 reflections (all t' observed data for which F, 2 20(F0)) in the resoluhe tion range 8 to 1.7 A. We estimate the average positional standard deviation to be about @15A, based on the statistical method described by Luzzatti (1952). The model has a root-mean-square deviation from ideality of 0013 A in bond lengths and 2.9" in bond angles. During the final stages of the refinement, 3 side-chains, Met30. Ser63 and Glul16, with multiple conformations were identified (e.g. Met30, Fig. 1). The refined co-ordinates have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al.. 1977). unpublished results; Table 2). If the two molrculrs are expressed in equivalent crystallographic co-ordinate systems, the root-mean-square deviation between the two structures for all main-chain atoms hrn be is 1.8 .!I. The human cc-lac structure mav t' superimposed upon baboon cr-lac by a +&-J rot)ation and @9a translation along this rotation axis. The effect of this is to produce shifts of up to 3 a in t hr x and z directions of the unit cell, which presumably accounts for the failure in the initial rigid body refinement. At this point the average deviation between the two structures for all main-chain atoms is @4 A and the root-mean-square deviation 0.67 A. The solvent structure also has similarities, with several water molecules common to both structures (deviations less than I.0 A). The internal water molecules are similarly positioned in both structures (Table 3). The difference between these two structures are a reflection. to some extent. of the differences in unit cell parameters. From Figure 2 it is evident that the significant differences occur in the region 41 to 47 and at the (1 terminus. Residues 41

mation (Fig. 3(a)). As expected, from the baboon a-lac structure, the C-terminal arm of the human a-lac molecule is rather flexible and is different to the corresponding region in baboon u-lac (Fig. 3(b)). supporting the hypothesis that the C terminus in a-lac can adopt multiple conformations (Acharya et al., 1989). In general, the overall environments of the sidechains in the two structures are very similar even though some side-chains in human a-lac have different orientations from those of the corresponding side-chains in baboon a-lac (e.g. Glu46 and Asp83). These effects are due in part to different packing interactions in the two crystals and in part to the presence of multiple conformations (e.g. MetSO, Fig. 3(c)). In such cases, only the best conformer was taken into account during the refinement of the structure and the other conformer was crudely modelled with solvent molecules. The need for more satisfactory treatments has been indicated by Kuriyan et aZ. (1986) and Gros et al. (1990).

a-lac is a calcium binding protein and possesses a novel calcium binding fold (Stuart et al., 1986; Acharya et al., 1989). The atomic structures around the calcium ion, in baboon a-lac and human a-lac superimpose well (Fig. 3(d) and (e)). The co-ordination around the calcium (Table 4) is a slightly disorted pentagonal hipyramid. The Ca-0 distances vary from 2.24 to 2.42 8, corresponding to a tight calcium binding loop in the structure. The positioning of the Asp83 side-chain is different) in human a-lac and baboon a-lac, but this does not seem to affect the geometry of the calcium binding site (Fig. 3(d) and (e)). There is an " extra" water molecule in the vicinity of the calcium binding site in human a-lac, hydrogen bonded to Asp84 (2.76 8) and Asp87 (2.91 8) (Fig. 3(d)). The structure of human a-lac confirms the previous observation in the baboon a-lac structure that the calcium binding fold only superficially resembles the " EF-hand" structure and presumably has no evolutionary relationship with other EF-hand structures (Stuart et al., 1986; Acharya et al., 1989). The biological role of calcium in a-lac is not yet

clear. though some evidence suggests that Ca2+ is necessary for a-lar to modify or modulate lactose synthesis (Musci & Berliner, 1985). Accordingly, cr-lac might act as a calcium modulated protein (Thompson rt al.. 1988). Recently Rao clr Brew (1989) proposed that t,ha a-lac calcium binding site has the in ~,izro function of imposing calcium regulation on the folding of the nascent cc-lac molecule and thereby on lactose synthesis. Kuwajima (1989) and Kuwajima rt al. (1989) propose that the calcium binding loop in a-lac may be a unique critical substructure in its folding. It is the best' defined part. of the st,ruct,ure in the X-ray structures (as judged

by the B-fac$ors; Table -l) irl both human and baboon a-lacs. Studies on the molben plobule state of guinea pig sr-lac by nuclear magnetic resonan(*e methods (Saum d trl., 19X9) concluded that thy calcium binding loop is a highly structured part of the molecule even in this partly unfolded form. a-lac can bind a variety of metal ions such as Ca2 + , Zn 2+. Ch2+, Clo2+, A13+ and Mn2+ and t,here have been a number of suggestions (Hiraoka rt nl., 1980; Murakami rt al., 1982: Rratcher & Kronman. 1984; Desmet & van (:auwelaert, 1988) that t)hrre is a Zn2+ binding site in cc-lac that is distinc+ from the calcium binding site. the occupation of' whic.h

From the plots it is clear that baboon a-lac has somewhat higher B-values for most of the atoms in comparison with human a-lac (mean B-value for all main-chain atoms of 25.5 A2 compared to 19.5 A' A further difference is in the ). crystallographic refinement strategies used (baboon a-lac: PROLSQ (Konnert & Hendrickson, 1980), human a-lac: X-PLOR (Briinger, 1988, 1989; Kriinger et al., 1989)). However, since the target residual minimized in each refinement is identical that is unlikely to be a serious effect. This is likely to be due, in part,, to the radiation damage suffered during the intensity data collection for baboon a-lac crystals on the linear diffractometer and perhaps, to some extent, to undetected systematic error in the data (e.g. absorption errors). Given the well known difficulties in defining absolute B-values (Stuart & Phillips, 1986), we attach more significance to the fact that the relative mobilities are very similar for the two structures; the correlation coefficient between main-chain atom B-factors (cs,t) is 084. We have also investigated the relationship discrepancy between mobility and positional between the two molecules. The correlation coeffi-

cient (&,,,S) for these two quantities has a very high value, 982; thus the regions of the molecules that differ are those of high mobility in each structure and there is no indication of any rearrangement of rigid segments of the molecule between the two structures. As mentioned before, the C terminus is mobile in human a-lac and has high B-values and, in general, it is true that the a-lac molecule has greater mobility than hen-egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) (Acharya et al., 1989). The conformational flexibility of the C terminus in cr-lac might indicate that it has a role in stabilizing the interaction of a-lac with GTase upon formation of the lactose synthetase complex, which is of important functional significance, and does not occur with C-type lysozymes. Further experiments are required to resolve this point. (d) Sequence
changes and crystal packing

The packing of the molecules in the crystals of baboon and human a-lac is similar. However, there are some water mediated interactions in the human a-lac structure that appear to be facilitated partly by the apparent amino acid differences between the two species (Table 5). Also, the differences in the side-chain orientations (mainly Glu46 and Asp83) provide additional intermolecular contacts for the stabilization of the crystal packing in human cc-lac (Table 5).
