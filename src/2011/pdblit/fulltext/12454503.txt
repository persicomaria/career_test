The structure of inactive pyruvate formate-lyase in complex with a Ê natural substrate, pyruvate, was solved at 2.7 A resolution. Both active sites of the homodimeric enzyme are occupied by pyruvate; additional binding sites were not found. Pyruvate was found in a cleft close to the active-site cysteines 418 and 419, with the carboxyl group in contact with arginines 176 and 435 and the methyl group within van der Waals distance of Phe327. It is believed that the binding site of pyruvate is not the position of pyruvate as the reaction initiates, as conformational changes occur during activation of the enzyme.

1. Introduction
Pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL; EC 2.3.1.54) is an anaerobic enzyme that catalyses the conversion of pyruvate and coenzyme A (CoA) to acetyl-CoA and formate. PFL is a homodimer of 85 kDa subunits, displaying half-of-the-sites reactivity (Unkrig et al., 1989). Active PFL contains a relatively stable glycyl radical located at Gly734 (Knappe et al., 1984; Wagner et al., 1992). Activation of PFL is performed by an activating enzyme (EC 1.97.1.4) containing an iron±sulfur cluster, which generates the Gly734 radical using a 5H -deoxyadenosyl radical derived from S-adenosyl methionine (Frey et al., 1994). Pyruvate, or its analogue oxamate, is required for activation (Chase & Rabenowitz, 1968; Knappe et al., 1974). Based on numerous biochemical studies, various mechanistic models have been proposed (reviewed by Stubbe & van der Donk, 1998). Several well established features of the mechanism include the Gly734 radical, involvement of Cys418 and Cys419 close to Gly734 (Plaga et al., 1988) and hydrogen exchange between Cys419 and Gly734 (Parast et al., 1995). Pyruvate (or oxamate) is required for activation of PFL, but it is not clear whether pyruvate binds ®rst to the active site of PFL in the kinetic pathway, with subsequent activation of the Gly radical, or whether the `activating pyruvate' binds elsewhere and pyruvate only binds in the active site subsequent to activation. Recent crystal structures È (Leppanen, Merckel et al., 1999; Becker et al., 1999) have elucidated features supporting the mechanistic models. PFL contains a tenstranded /-barrel which consists of two sets of ®ve parallel -strands assembled in an antiparallel manner. Inside the barrel is a loop containing the active-site cysteines. These features relate PFL to another class of radical

enzymes, the ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs; Uhlin & Eklund, 1994; Logan et al., 1999). In PFL there is also another loop containing Gly734 inside the barrel. This loop is also present in class III RNRs, which likewise work anaerobically via a glycyl radical. Based on the PFL±oxamate complex structure, Becker et al. (1999) proposed that the thiyl radical Cys418 attacks the substrate, although we have suggested Cys419 as the attacking È radical (Wong & Kozarich, 1994; Leppanen et al., 1999) based on previous work from the Knappe group (Plaga et al., 1988; Knappe & Wagner, 1995). Oxamate, however, is an inert analogue of pyruvate (with an amino group in place of the methyl group) that is believed not to bind to the active site (Knappe et al., 1974). Here, we report the binding of pyruvate in a manner similar to that of oxamate. This result throws some doubt on oxamate-bound models of catalysis (Becker et al., 1999).

Recombinant PFL was puri®ed from Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Pharmacia) bearing pKKBWM5.5C (Parast et al., 1995). Induction with IPTG was not required. Cell culture and protein puri®cation were performed as published for a stable proteolytic È fragment of PFL (Leppanen, Parast et. al., 1999). Only a single anion-exchange step was required to achieve crystallizable protein. After anion exchange, fractions containing PFL were pooled and the buffer was changed with multiple concentration and dilution steps to 50 mM MOPS/NH3 containing 20 mM DTT. Finally, PFL was concentrated to 25 mg mlÀ1 with Centriprep-30 (Amicon). Protein concentrations were determined with a BioRad kit (Bradford, 1976) with bovine serum

Crystals were obtained from 50 ml dialysis buttons (Hampton Research) placed in a well containing 1.5 ml 25 mM MOPS/NH3 pH 7.3, 25%(w/v) PEG 1000, 10 mM DTT, 25 mM NH4Cl, 25 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM MgCl2.

3. Results and discussion
The root-mean-square deviation between the PFL±pyruvate complex and the oxamate Ê complex is 0.30 A per C. Electron-density peaks above 10' in the Fo À Fc map could be identi®ed as pyruvate molecules in both active sites. Although it was shown by Knappe & Wagner (1995) that only one pyruvate molecule is bound covalently per PFL dimer whether it is active or inactive, here we show that both active sites are equally occupied. Electron density between Cys418 and the carbonyl carbon of pyruvate is continuous, but thiohemiketal as a covalent adduct does not ®t the density properly, even though Knappe & Wagner (1995) reported that a single thiohemiketal is bound per monomer in the inactive enzyme to Cys419 not Cys418 ± results we have been unable to reproduce (Kozarich, unpublished work). An electron-density map calculated without pyruvate shows good density around the substrate, indicating that in this structure pyruvate is closer to Cys418 than Cys419, with carbonyl carbon±sulfur Ê distances of 3.0 and 5.8 A, respectively (Fig. 1). Additional pyruvate molecules were not found. Pyruvate is bound to a cleft between arginines 176 and 435. Oxamate was also modelled between the two arginines (Becker et al., 1999), but there is a rotation of 18 between these molecules (Fig. 1). The largest difference between equivalent atoms in pyruvate and oxamate is Ê 0.8 A (carboxyl O atoms). This rotation is caused by hydrophobic interactions between the methyl group of pyruvate and hydrophobic residues surrounding the active site (Fig. 2), which cannot occur with the oxamate amino group. In particular, the distance between Phe327 and the pyruvate methyl group, replaced by the amino group Ê in oxamate, has decreased from 4.4 to 3.6 A. A PEG molecule was found between symmetry-related dimers. Previous structures have described this site as consisting of water molecules, but the density in our structure clearly supports a part of a PEG molecule (C12O7). PEG plays a crucial role in the crystallization of PFL by binding to a cleft formed by two symmetry-related dimers.

Prior to data collection, crystals were dialysed overnight against 25 mM MOPS/ NH3 pH 7.3 containing 30%(w/v) PEG 1000, 25 mM NH4Cl, 25 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM DTT and 1 M dl-threitol. Crystals were then picked up in a loop and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Synchrotron radiation was used for data collection on the X11 beamline at the EMBL Outstation, DESY (Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a MAR CCD detector. Diffraction data were processed using the HKL package (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) and the statistics are given in Table 1. Molecular-replacement methods Ê were used to solve the structure at 4 A resolution using the PFL structure as a search model (Becker et al., 1999; PDB code Ê 2p¯). The resolution was extended to 2.7 A in several rounds of rigid-body re®nement with monomers de®ned as rigid bodies. 5% of the data was excluded from re®nement for free R-factor calculation. Molecular replacement and re®nement were È performed with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints

All the structural studies were performed with inactive PFL and we believe that largescale conformational changes occur during activation. Firstly, all the structures solved are symmetric, but PFL has half-of-the-sites reactivity, as only one of the two Gly734 residues forms a radical (Unkrig et al., 1989). Secondly, the glycine loop is buried in the inactive enzyme inside the ten-stranded Ê barrel about 8 A from the surface, so either a radical transfer chain, as in ribonucleotide reductase type I (Stubbe & van der Donk, 1998), or else a conformational change involving a large-scale motion of the Gly loop must occur. The latter is clearly correct, as H-atom transfer occurs directly from Gly734 to the adenosyl radical (Frey et al., 1994). However, there are essentially no changes between the apo-oxamate and pyruvate structures (Gly734 C moves by Ê 0.25 A between the apo and the oxamateÊ complex structure and by 0.2 A between the apo and the pyruvate-complex structure), making it hard to see how the inactive pyruvate-complex and oxamate-complex structures could undergo activation. Thirdly, oxamate works as an effector enabling the activation to occur, but it should not bind to the active site of active PFL (Knappe et al., 1974). Finally, the oxamate structure (Becker et al., 1999) and our pyruvate complex structures show no signs of a CoAbinding pocket leading to the active site. Consequently, it is hard to make direct conclusions about the mechanism based on these structures. One possibility (as discussed in Becker et al., 1999) is that these structures reveal the position of pyruvate and oxamate as the allosteric activator at or close to the site of
Acta Cryst. (2002). D58, 2209±2212

catalysis. Another possibility is that the site described here (and in Becker et al., 1999) represents adventitious binding arising from the non-physiological concentration (25 mM) of pyruvate used. In that case, it is unclear where pyruvate and oxamate bind to PFL as allosteric activators. An intriguing possibility remains, therefore, that the allosteric site is not on PFL, but is instead on the activating enzyme (Knappe et al., 1974). The catalytic mechanism we originally È proposed (Leppanen, Merckel et al., 1999; Wong & Kozarich, 1994; Brush et al., 1988) could still be correct: the site of radical attack could be at Cys419 although, on balance, the structures are more consistent with attack by Cys418. If attack were at Cys419, pyruvate would have to move Ê È by a few angstroms from its current position. Based on the structure of a stable proteolytic fragment of PFL, we proposed that coenzyme A (CoA) binds to a cleft surrounded by Arg313 and Arg316 È (Leppanen, Merckel et al., 1999). With respect to the full-length protein, this seems still to be possible: arginines 107, 313, 316 and 738 and Asn65 form a pocket that could bind the polar head group of CoA. For CoA to bind, however, a conformational change is required. The fact that a conformational change is required is consistent with solution data showing that CoA-mediated thioester exchange is slow in the unactivated enzyme (Knappe et al., 1993) and with the structural and biochemical data (above) indicating that the active site in this structure is not in the active conformation. Clearly, a full picture of catalysis in PFL will only emerge from structures of the activated enzyme.
