The main peptidase (Mpro) from the coronavirus (CoV) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is one of the most attractive molecular targets for the development of anti-SARS agents. We report the irreversible inhibition of SARS-CoV Mpro by an aza-peptide epoxide (APE; kinact/KiZ 1900(G400) MK1 sK1). The crystal structures of the Mpro:APE complex in the space groups C2 and P212121 revealed the formation of a covalent bond between the catalytic Cys145 Sg atom of the peptidase and the epoxide C3 atom of the inhibitor, substantiating the mode of action of this class of cysteine-peptidase inhibitors. The aza-peptide component of APE binds in the substrate-binding regions of Mpro in a substrate-like manner, with excellent structural and chemical complementarity. In addition, the crystal structure of unbound Mpro in the space group C2 revealed that the "N-fingers" (N-terminal residues 1 to 7) of both protomers of Mpro are well defined and the substrate-binding regions of both protomers are in the catalytically competent conformation at the crystallization pH of 6.5, contrary to the previously determined crystal structures of unbound Mpro in the space group P21.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first emerged in China in November 2002. This highly transmissible, infectious and often fatal disease spread to 32 countries across five continents, causing close to 8500 infections and over 900 deaths, until being contained by the summer of 2003. Several infections in Asia were reported subsequently, alerting the world that it remains at risk of another outbreak of SARS (World Health Organization: Severe acute respiratory syndrome). Although the development of anti-SARS vaccines

and drugs are in progress, these agents are still far from clinical use.1 Additional efforts in these areas of study therefore remain paramount. SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV);2­4 it is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus infecting respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelial cells, macrophages, and other cell types, thereby causing systemic changes and damaging many vital organs such as lung, heart, liver, kidney and adrenal gland.4,5 Anti-SARS therapeutics could target several major steps in the viral life-cycle, such as virus­cell interactions, virus entry, intracellular viral replication, and virus assembly and exit.1 The intracellular replication of SARS-CoV is mediated by a "replicase" complex derived from two virally coded polyprotein precursors, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa).6,7 The formation of this replicase complex requires the extensive processing of the two polyproteins by two cysteine peptidases within them, namely the main peptidase (M pro), also known as the 3C-like

(b) Progress curves for the steady-state cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide substrate observed using 64 mM peptide and either no APE (dotted line) or 5 mM CbzLeu-Phe-AGln-(S,S)EP-COOEt (continuous line). The appearance of product was followed using excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 420 nm, respectively. Analysis of these data using equation (1), in which Pi and PN represent the initial and final product concentrations, respectively, yielded inactivation rates, js, of 0.07 minK1 and 0.29 minK1, respectively. (c) The rate of Mpro inhibition was determined using 16 mM (,), 32 mM (-), 64 mM (D) and 100 mM (B) peptide. Equation (2) was fit to the data using the least-squares, dynamic

peptidase (3CLpro) because of its similarity to the 3C peptidases of Picornaviridae,8 and the accessory papain-like peptidase 2 (PL2pro). PL2pro cleaves at three sites in the N-proximal regions of the two polyproteins, whereas Mpro cleaves at 11 sites in the central and C-proximal regions of the two polyproteins. Mpro releases the key proteins in viral replication, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the helicase.7 Playing such an essential role, SARS-CoV Mpro is an attractive molecular target for the development of anti-SARS drugs acting as the inhibitors of the peptidase. SARS-CoV Mpro has a molecular mass of 33.8 kDa per protomer; it exists as a homodimer over a wide range of concentrations in solution.9­12 The crystal structures of Mpro in the space group P21 showed that the two protomers of the dimeric peptidase are oriented almost perpendicular to each other and that each protomer consists of three domains. Domain I (residues 8 to 101) and domain II (residues 102 to 184) comprise a two-b-barrel fold similar to that of the chymotrypsin-type serine peptidases. Domain III (residues 201 to 300) has five a-helices and is connected to domain II by a long loop (residues 185 to 200). Each protomer has its own substrate-binding region situated in the cleft between domains I and II.13 A recent mutagenesis study has confirmed that M pro is a cysteine peptidase with a Cys-His catalytic dyad at the active site.14 As suggested by the structure-based sequence alignment of the main peptidases (including their flanking residues in the polyproteins) from SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses,15 and confirmed by in vitro studies,7,9 these peptidases preferentially cleave at a consensus sequence for the P4 to P1 0 residues of substrates (nomenclature based on that of Schechter and Berger16): (amino acid with a small side-chain)-(any amino acid)-Leu-GlnY(Ala, Ser, Gly). A number of small-molecule inhibitors of SARSCoV Mpro have been proposed using various methodologies, such as knowledge-based discovery17,18 and high-throughput screening (experimental19­21 or virtual22,23). Although the efficacies of many of these inhibitors were supported by assay results, the modes of action are unknown for most of them. Also, the lack of structural information for inhibitors binding to Mpro impedes the structurebased optimization of these inhibitors. To our knowledge, the crystal structure of Mpro bound by chloromethyl ketone (CMK) has so far been the only published structure for an inhibitor-bound Mpro.13 Aza-peptide epoxides (APEs) were synthesized as a new class of inhibitors apparently specific for clan CD cysteine peptidases24 (based on the

weighting options of LEONORA,37 yielding the following parameters: kinactZ35(G17)!10K3 sK1, KiZ18(G9) mM and KmZ96(G31) mM. Additional experimental details are provided in Materials and Methods.

classification by Barrett and Rawlings25), including the legumains26 and the caspases.27 Each APE has an aza-peptide component, with an epoxide moiety attached to the carbonyl group of the P1 residue. The side-chain of the P1 residue predominantly determines the target-peptidase specificity of an APE. The substituent on the epoxide C2 atom also allows some tuning of both the inhibitory activity and specificity of APE towards a particular target peptidase. The aza-peptide component resembles a peptide, except that the Ca atom of the P1 residue in the former is replaced by a nitrogen atom to form an aza-amino acid residue. This introduces trigonal planar geometry to the a-atom of the P1 residue and reduces the electrophilicity of the carbonyl C atom of the P1 residue, thereby making the carbonyl group of the P1 residue resistant to nucleophilic attack.28 It has been proposed that APEs inhibit their target peptidases irreversibly by a mechanism in which the catalytic Cys Sg atom nucleophilically attacks one of the two epoxide carbon atoms (C2 or C3) of APE (Figure 1(a)).24,26,27 This results in the opening of the conformationally strained epoxide

Results
Inhibition of SARS-CoV Mpro by an APE We hypothesized that an APE possessing an azaglutamine (AGln) as the P1 residue to mimic the S1 specificity of SARS-CoV Mpro for Gln (Figure 1(a)) would irreversibly inhibit the peptidase. Accordingly, we synthesized Cbz-Leu-Phe-AGln-(S,S)EPCOOEt and Cbz-Leu-Phe-AGln-(R,R)EP-COOEt. Micromolar quantities of the S,S diastereomer strongly inhibited the cleavage of a peptidic substrate, manifesting itself as a pronounced slowing of the reaction velocity as the reaction progressed (Figure 1(b)). Under these conditions, the R,R diastereomer did not detectably inhibit Mpro. Analysis of the rates of inactivation (js) at different concentrations of substrate and inhibitor

SARS-CoV Mpro in three forms: wild-type peptidase in the absence and presence of APE in the space group C2, and a variant of the peptidase with an Ala added to the N terminus of the wild-type sequence, pro MCAðK1Þ , bound by APE in the space group P212121. The parameters and statistics derived from X-ray diffraction data processing and structure refinement are summarized in Table 1. For unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex in the space group C2, each asymmetric unit has only one protomer of the dimer. The two protomers of each dimer are related by the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry (Figure 2). All residues of the protomer (residues 1 to 306) were identified in the electron density maps. In the Ramachandran plot for the structure of unbound Mpro, Asp33, Ala46 and Glu47 are in the generously allowed regions, whereas Asn84, Tyr154 and Ile286 are in the disallowed regions. The Asp33 Od2 atom forms a hydrogen bond with the Tyr101 phenolic ° OH group (2.9 A). The Asn84 Nd2 atom forms a hydrogen bond with the Glu178 carbonyl O atom ° (3.2 A), and possibly there are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces between the side-chains of Asn84 and Lys180 as well. Hydrophobic interactions occur between the side-chains of Thr285 and Ile286 of opposite protomers at the dimer interface. The electron densities for the side-chains of Ala46, Glu47 and Tyr154 are not well defined. Similarly, in the Ramachandran plot for the structure of the Mpro:APE complex, Asp33, Asn84, Tyr154 and Asn277 are in the generously allowed

As visualized in all three structures, the residues forming the substrate-binding regions of both protomers of the peptidase are in the catalytically competent conformation, similar to their counterparts in the structures of the main peptidases from other coronaviruses,15,29 and to those in protomer A of the P21 structures of SARSCoV Mpro.13 In the structure of unbound Mpro, the ° catalytic dyad has a distance of 3.7 A between the His41 N32 atom and the Cys145 Sg atom, and the Cys145 Sg atom is coplanar with the atoms of the His41 imidazole ring. Superimposition of the structures of unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex shows that the binding of APE does not cause any major changes in the structure of the peptidase (Table 2). The Cys145 Ca­Cb bond undergoes a 958 rotation (c1: from K64.08 to C30.78) accompanying the formation of a covalent bond ° with a distance of 2.01 A between the Cys145 Sg atom of the peptidase and the epoxide C3 atom of APE (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The length of a C­S ° single bond is normally about 1.8 A. However, with an estimated overall coordinate error ° (based on maximum likelihood) of 0.12 A for pro the structure of the M :APE complex, the difference between the refined and expected ° distances (0.2 A) is not considered significant.

For the MCAðK1Þ :APE complex in the space group P212121, there is a dimer in each asymmetric unit. Only the residues 1A to 304A and residues 1B to 300B were identified in the electron density maps. In the Ramachandran plot for this structure, Asp33 and Asn84 of both protomers are in the generously allowed regions, whereas Tyr154 and Ile286 of both protomers are in the disallowed regions. The electron density for Tyr154 is not well defined. Superimposition (see Materials and Methods) of protomers A and B yielded a root° mean-square difference (rmsd) of 0.29 A.

1144 formation of this new covalent bond, whereas that at the C2 atom is a result of the change in the ranking order of substituents (Figure 5(d)). Asn142 and Cys145 of the peptidase flank a short loop constituting the oxyanion hole, with the amide hydrogen atoms of Gly143 and Cys145 as the hydrogen-bond donors to stabilize the carbonyl O atom in the scissile peptide group of the substrate. The conformation of this loop remains essentially unchanged upon the binding of APE. The P1-AGln carbonyl O atom of APE is accommodated in the oxyanion hole of the peptidase, accepting hydrogen bonds from the amide hydrogen atoms of Gly143 ° ° and Cys145 at distances of 2.7 A and 3.4 A , respectively (Figure 4(a) and (b)). The P1-AGln Na atom of APE remains sp2-hybridized and adopts trigonal planar geometry. For P1-AGln, the equivalent to f, C(P2-Phe)-N(P1-AGln)-Na(P1-AGln)C(P1-AGln), is K84.88 (Figure 5(a)), and the equivalent to j, N(P1-AGln)-Na(P1-AGln)-C(P1AGln)-C3(epoxide), is K7.38 (Figure 5(b)). With the error in atomic coordinates considered, the trigonal plane centered at the P1-AGln Na atom is coplanar with that centered at the P1-AGln carbonyl C atom, allowing the Na atom to reduce the electrophilicity of the carbonyl C atom by p-electron delocalization. The equivalent to c1 of P1-AGln, N-Na-Cb-Cg, is K77.48. Compared to the structure of the Mpro:APE pro complex, the structure of the MCAðK1Þ :APE complex shows some differences in the geometry of binding. In the latter, the rotation of the Cys145 Ca­Cb bond of the peptidase reaches a more positive value of c1 (protomer A, 47.58; protomer B, 46.58). The length of the covalent bond between the Cys145 Sg atom of the peptidase and the epoxide C3 atom of APE is ° ° 2.09 A in protomer A and 2.05 A in protomer B (Figure 4(a) to (c)). Note that the estimated overall coordinate error (based on maximum likelihood) ° for this structure is 0.17 A . O]C(P1-AGln)g C3(epoxide)-S (Cys145) makes a torsion angle of 72.08 in protomer A and 85.58 in protomer B (Figure 5(g)). In both protomers, the configurations of the C2 and C3 atoms of APE are inverted from S,S to R,R (Figure 5(h)), and the P1-AGln Na atom of APE remains sp2-hybridized and adopts trigonal planar geometry. For the P1-AGln of APE, the equivalent to f, C(P2-Phe)-N(P1-AGln)-Na(P1AGln)-C(P1-AGln), is K83.78 in protomer A and K105.78 in protomer B (Figure 5(e)), and the equivalent to j, N(P1-AGln)-Na(P1-AGln)-C(P1AGln)-C3(epoxide), is K12.38 in protomer A and K8.88 in protomer B (Figure 5(f)). With the errors in atomic coordinates considered, the trigonal plane centered at the P1-AGln Na atom is roughly coplanar with that centered at the P1-AGln carbonyl C atom in both protomers. The equivalent to c1 of P1-AGln, N-Na-Cb-Cg, is K82.78 in protomer A and K119.58 in protomer B. The aza-peptide component of APE binds in the substrate-binding regions of both protomers of Mpro in a substrate-like manner. Consistent with the results of the secondary-structure studies for the

SARS-CoV Mpro:APE Complex

substrates of this peptidase,9 the structures of the pro Mpro:APE and MCAðK1Þ :APE complexes show that the main chain of the aza-peptide component of APE interacts with the main chain of the residues 164 to 166 of the peptidase through amide hydrogen­carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bonding in the manner of an anti-parallel b sheet in both protomers (Figure 4(a) to (c)). Specificity pockets The predominant S1 specificity of SARS-CoV Mpro for Gln is determined primarily by His163. In the structure of unbound Mpro, the His163 N32 atom ° interacts with a chloride ion at a distance of 3.3 A and in the plane of the His163 imidazole ring, whereas in the structures of the Mpro:APE and pro MCAðK1Þ :APE complexes, the chloride ion is displaced by the P1-AGln side-chain amide group of APE with its O31 atom accepting a hydrogen bond ° from the His163 N32 atom of the peptidase (2.6 A to ° ). Additional hydrogen bonds may be 2.8 A donated, though not of ideal geometry, by the P1-AGln N32 atom of APE to the Phe140 carbonyl O atom and the Glu166 O32 atom of the peptidase (Figure 4(b) and (c)). In both protomers of all three structures, the Phe140 phenyl ring interacts with the His163 imidazole ring through p-stacking (distance between the geometric centers of the rings: 3.7 to ° 3.8 A), and the latter is properly oriented for its Nd1 atom to accept a hydrogen bond from the Tyr161 ° phenolic OH group (2.9 to 3.1 A). This hydrogen bond maintains the neutral tautomeric state of the His163 imidazole ring with its N32 atom protonated over a broad range of pH. This is crucial for the interaction of the His163 of the peptidase with the P1-Gln of the substrate.13,15,29 In each peptidase dimer, the integrity of the S1 specificity pocket in one protomer requires the protonated amino group of Ser1 from the other protomer. This residue is at the tip of the N-finger (N-terminal residues 1 to 7) propagating between the domain III of its parent protomer and the domain II of the partner protomer. In the structures of unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex, the Ser1 amino group of each protomer forms an ionic interaction with the Glu166 side-chain carboxyl ° group of the other protomer (2.7 A). The Ser1 of each protomer also interacts with the Phe140 of the other protomer through amide hydrogen­carbonyl ° oxygen hydrogen bonding (3.2 A). These three residues are thus held together to form the "floor" of the S1 specificity pocket (Figure 6(a)). In both pro protomers of the MCAðK1Þ :APE complex, however, Ser1 is N-terminally blocked by the additional Ala, and the ionic interaction between the Ser1 amino group and Glu166 side-chain carboxyl group is lost. This is also followed by the loss of the amide hydrogen­carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bond between Ser1 and Phe140 because Ser1 is no longer properly oriented. The additional Ala is disordered, leaving Ser1 unanchored and the floor of the S1 specificity pocket partly disrupted (Figure 6(b)).

Figure 6. Floor of the S1 specificity pocket of SARS-CoV Mpro. Phe140, Glu166 and Glu290 of the first protomer (green) and the N-finger (N-terminal residues 1 to 7) of the second protomer (magenta) are shown. (a) In the structures of unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex, Phe140 and Glu166 of the first protomer interact with Ser1 of the second pro protomer to form the floor of the S1 specificity pocket. (b) In the structure of the MCAðK1Þ :APE complex, the disordered Nterminal Ala of the second protomer (not shown) orients Ser1 poorly for any interaction with Phe140 and Glu166 of the first protomer. The interaction between Glu290 of the first protomer and Arg4 of the second protomer, however, remains in both (a) and (b). Hydrogen bonds are shown as broken lines.

Despite the disruption of the S1 pocket by the presence of a single additional N-terminal residue, the presence of a ten-residue affinity tag at the N terminus of Mpro reduced the specific activity of the peptidase by less than an order of magnitude (results not shown). Mpro has greatest preference for Leu and Ile at P2, followed by Phe, Val and Met in that order.7,9 In the pro structures of the M pro :APE and MCAðK1Þ :APE complexes, the P2-Phe side-chain of APE fits snugly in the S2 specificity pocket of the peptidase, where the interactions are mainly hydrophobic. The P2-Phe phenyl ring of APE interacts with the His41 imidazole ring of the peptidase through p-stacking (distance between the geometric centers ° of the two rings: 4.3 to 4.6 A). Superimposition of the structures of unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex shows that, upon the binding of APE, the side-chain of Met49 undergoes a large conformational change, thereby opening the S2 specificity pocket for the P2-Phe side-chain of APE. Also, the side-chain of Gln189 is no longer disordered after its reorientation and formation of a hydrogen bond through its O31 atom with the P2-Phe amide ° ° hydrogen atom of APE (2.8 A to 3.4 A). This appears to secure the P2-Phe of APE in the S2 specificity pocket of the peptidase (Figures 3(a) and (b) and 4(a)). pro In the structures of the Mpro:APE and MCAðK1Þ :APE complexes, the P3-Leu side-chain of APE extends into the solvent and does not have any significant interactions with the peptidase (Figures 3(a) and (b) and 4(a)). This lack of interactions is consistent with

the fact that no S3 specificity of Mpro could be established.7 The aza-peptide component of APE consists of only three residues, so its benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group partly takes up the space for the P4 residue of a substrate. Mpro has a shallow S4 specificity pocket that accommodates small side-chains (Ser, Thr, Val, Pro and Ala).7 In the Mpro:APE complex and pro protomer B of the MCAðK1Þ :APE complex, the binding of the Cbz group of APE does not use the S4 specificity pocket of the peptidase. The position for the Ca atom of a P4 residue of a substrate is occupied by the O2 atom in the Cbz group of APE. In this conformation, the benzyl group of APE makes contacts with Pro168 and with residues 190 to 192 of the peptidase; the Cbz group is exposed to the solvent (Figures 3(a) and 4(b)). In contrast, in pro protomer A of the MCAðK1Þ :APE complex, the benzyl group of APE squeezes into and thereby widens the S4 specificity pocket of the peptidase, so that it is snugly accommodated in this enlarged pocket now formed by the residues 165 to 168, Phe185, Gln192 and the main-chain atoms of Val186 (Figures 3(b) and 4(c)). The S1 0 specificity pocket of Mpro is also shallow, accommodating only small side-chains (Ser, Ala, Gly, Asn and Cys).7,9 In the design of APEs, several different epoxide derivatives were attached to the aza-peptide component to modulate the interactions of APE with the S1 0 specificity pocket of a clan CD cysteine peptidase.24,26,27 In the structures pro of the Mpro:APE and MCAðK1Þ :APE complexes, 0 however, the S1 specificity pocket of the peptidase

1146 is apparently not used in the binding of APE. The epoxide C2 atom of APE sits close to the position for the Ca atom of the P1 0 residue of a substrate and the hydroxyl group on the C2 atom is exposed to the solvent. The ethyl ester group of APE lies against the "ceiling" of the active site lined by Leu27, Pro39, His41, and the peptide group between His41 and Val42. Dimer interface The structures reported here show similar features at their dimer interfaces. The solventaccessible surface area (per protomer) buried upon dimerization of SARS-CoV Mpro is from ° ° 1250 A2 to 1260 A2. In the structures of unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex, the crystallographic 2-fold axis passes through the dimer interface and brings the opposite interacting residue-pairs into exact 2-fold symmetry (Figure 2); pro whereas in the structure of the MCAðK1Þ :APE complex, even in the absence of a crystallographic 2-fold axis, the dimer interface still exhibits approximate 2-fold symmetry. In all three structures, the dimer interface concentrates on one face of each protomer: that containing the residues on the N-finger, and domains II and III. The majority of the interactions occur between the residues on the N-finger and domain II. Two ionic interactions, one between the Ser1 amino group and the Glu166 sidechain carboxyl group of opposite protomers, and one between the side-chains of the Arg4 and Glu290 of opposite protomers, are observed in the strucpro tures of unbound M pro and the MCAðK1Þ :APE complex (Figure 6(a)). However, in the structure of pro the MCAðK1Þ :APE complex, only the latter ion pair is observed (Figure 6(b)). In contrast to the N-finger immobilized at the dimer interface, the C-terminal loop (residues 301 to 306) is highly mobile as it is exposed to the solvent and anchored by only three or four solvent-exposed hydrogen bonds to some residues along the rim of the dimer interface. Interestingly, in the structures of unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex, the C-terminal loop of one protomer extends towards the S1 specificity pocket of the other protomer, whereas in the pro structure of the MCAðK1Þ :APE complex, the C-terminal loop of protomer A (the only one visualized in this structure) propagates away from the S1 specificity pocket of protomer B.

SARS-CoV Mpro:APE Complex

Discussion
The kinetic data and crystal structures reported herein indicate that APEs have excellent potential as inhibitors of SARS-CoV Mpro and are worthy of further evaluation in the development of lead compounds for anti-SARS agents. Thus, the kinact/ Ki of Mpro for Cbz-Leu-Phe-AGln-(S,S)EP-COOEt is similar in magnitude to that of the first generation APEs produced to inhibit other cysteine peptidases.24,26,27 Optimization of the latter has yielded

inhibitors of caspases with kinact/Ki well over 106 MK1 sK1.27 The excellent specificities of APEs for clan CD cysteine peptidases24,26,27 suggest that APEs have better potential as inhibitors of Mpro than do chloromethyl ketones (CMKs), the first class of potential inhibitors proposed on a structural basis. The structure of the Mpro:CMK complex previously determined in the space group P21 shows different and unexpected modes of binding for CMK to the two protomers of the peptidase.13 CMKs are highly active alkylating agents and react with good nucleophiles, such as hydroxyl and thiol groups. They therefore inhibit serine peptidases as well as cysteine peptidases.28 A recent study showed that CMKs efficiently inhibit some clan CA cysteine peptidases, such as papain and the cathepsins.30 This casts doubt on the utility of CMKs as specific inhibitors for Mpro. In contrast, the structures of unbound Mpro and the Mpro:APE complex show that the aza-peptide component of APE binds to the peptidase in a substrate-like manner. The mainchain of the aza-peptide component of APE forms amide hydrogen­carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the residues 164 to 166 of the peptidase in the manner of an anti-parallel b-sheet. The P1 and P2 side-chains of APE occupy the S1 and S2 specificity pockets of the peptidase, respectively. Based on the definitions for the binding of epoxysuccinyl peptides to clan CA cysteine peptidases,28 this corresponds to the S and S 0 binding mode, with inclination to the S binding mode because the pre-cleavage portion of the substratebinding region of the peptidase makes the major contribution to Mpro:APE interactions. pro The structures of the Mpro:APE and MCAðK1Þ :APE complexes substantiate the mechanism by which APEs have been proposed to irreversibly inhibit their target peptidases (Figure 1(a)). Nucleophilic attack at the epoxide C3, rather than the C2, atom of APE, by the Cys145 Sg atom is consistent with the expected transition-state geometry for proteolysis catalyzed by Mpro. In caspase-3, the epoxide C3 atom is attacked (M. Grutter, unpublished results), whereas in caspase-1, the C2 atom is attacked (R. Rubin, unpublished results). In the case of epoxysuccinyl peptides binding to clan CA cysteine peptidases, the position of attack depends on the orientation of the epoxysuccinyl peptide in the substrate-binding region.28 E-64 binds to papain in the S binding mode, similar to the mode of APE binding to Mpro. In the papain:E-64 complex, however, the epoxide C2 atom is the one attacked.31 Nucleophilic attack at the epoxide C3 atom is observed in the S 0 binding mode, as exemplified by CA-074 binding to cathepsin B.32 The kinetic data and crystal structures indicate that Mpro reacts only with the S,S diastereomer of the APE and not its R,R diastereomer. Interestingly, the order of inhibitory activities for APEs towards most clan CD cysteine peptidases is S,SOR,RO transOcis (the racemic mixture of the S,R and R,S diastereomers). 24,26,27 Based on the M pro :APE

structures, we built models of each of the four diastereomers of APE at the active site of Mpro to explain the results of our trials (Figure 7(a) to (d)). These models show that, for APE to be accommodated in the substrate-binding regions of the

peptidase, the epoxide C3 atom of APE must be in the S configuration, otherwise the epoxide moiety sterically clashes with the "back-wall" of the active site of the peptidase and with the aza-peptide component of APE itself (Figure 7(b) and (c)). In the

1148 S configuration, the epoxide C3 atom of APE is also in better geometry with respect to the Cys145 Sg atom for the nucleophilic attack. The epoxide C2 atom of APE must be in the S configuration as well to allow the interactions between the epoxide moiety and the active site of the peptidase, otherwise the epoxide moiety sterically clashes with the loop constituting the oxyanion hole of the peptidase (Figure 7(d)). The model with the S,S diastereomer of APE also indicates that the distance between the His41 N32 atom of the peptidase and ° ° the epoxide O atom is 4 A to 5 A, and that these two atoms are not well aligned for proton transfer (Figure 7(a)). This suggests that the opening of the epoxide ring likely involves two steps separated by a conformational rearrangement of APE: (1) the protonation of the epoxide O atom and (2) the nucleophilic attack at the epoxide C3 atom. From the model, it is not possible to determine the order in which these steps occur. However, it would be energetically more favorable for protonation to be the first step. On the other hand, Mpro may be sufficiently flexible in solution to allow the alignment of the His41 N32 atom and the epoxide O atom for proton transfer. In such a scenario, protonation and nucleophilic attack could occur in a concerted manner, enabling the epoxide ring to open in a single step. Much of the mechanism for the inhibition of SARS-CoV Mpro by APE remains to be elucidated. Rigorous treatment of this issue using methodologies in organic chemistry will be required. All three structures successfully visualize the N-fingers of both protomers of Mpro. Despite the appreciable participation by the N-fingers in dimer interactions, it was shown experimentally that the deletion of the N-fingers inactivates the peptidase but has little effect on its dimerization properties. Molecular dynamic simulations suggested that the main role of the N-finger is one directing the peptidase to dimerize at an orientation facilitating the formation of substrate-binding regions in the catalytically competent conformation.10 This very likely relies on the two ionic interactions observed in the structures of unbound M pro and the Mpro:APE complex, one between the protonated amino group of Ser1 and the Glu166 side-chain carboxyl group of opposite protomers, and one between the side-chains of the Arg4 and Glu290 of opposite protomers. In the structure of the pro MCAðK1Þ :APE complex, the former ion-pair does not exist but both substrate-binding regions are still capable of accommodating APE in a manner similar to that exhibited by the structure of the Mpro:APE complex. This suggests that the former ionic interaction, possibly because it is relatively accessible to the solvent and therefore weaker, is of less importance. The crystal structure of Mpro previously determined in the space group P21 at pH 6.0 showed the collapse of the active site and S1 specificity pocket of one of the protomers, whereas the P21 structures at pH 7.6 and 8.0 showed the recovery of the

SARS-CoV Mpro:APE Complex

collapsed parts. Based on this trend, a pH-triggered switch for the catalytic activity of the peptidase was proposed.13 In our study, all crystals were grown at pH 6.5 and the resulting structures show that the substrate-binding regions of both protomers are in the catalytically competent conformation. This suggests the possibility of an alternative or additional mechanism underlying the pH-dependence of the activity of the peptidase, especially at pH 6.5 or above. The change in protonation/ deprotonation state of the catalytic dyad with pH is one of the possible second mechanisms. Insights into this possibility could be provided by the direct determinations of the pKa values of the catalytic dyad by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, as exemplified by the similar studies of the catalytic triad of a-lytic peptidase.33

Materials and Methods
Preparation of the protein and APEs SARS-CoV MCAðK1Þ was cloned, overexpressed and purified as described.21 A clone expressing Mpro was generated using oligonucleotide-directed evolution to delete the codon corresponding to the N-terminal Ala of pro MCAðK1Þ . Using this clone, Mpro was overexpressed and pro purified essentially as described for MCAðK1Þ. Cbz-LeuPhe-AGln-(S,S)EP-COOEt and Cbz-Leu-Phe-AGln(R,R)EP-COOEt were synthesized using the methods established to synthesize other APEs24,26,27 with minor modifications. Inhibition studies Enzymatic activity was measured by following the increase in fluorescence due to the cleavage of a fluorogenic peptide: Abz-Ser-Val-Thr-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly(NO2)Tyr-Arg, where Abz is aminobenzoate and (NO2)Tyr is nitrotyrosine. Fluorescence was measured using a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Canada, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a circulating water-bath. Experiments were performed using a 100 ml quartz cuvette. The standard assay contained 25 nM Mpro, 20 mM Bis­Tris (pH 7.0), 2 mM DTT, and was performed at 37.0(G0.1) 8C. The reaction was monitored using an excitation wavelength of 320 nm (5 nm bandpass) and an emission wavelength of 420 nm (10 nm bandpass). Initial velocities were determined from a least-squares analysis of the linear portion of the progress curves (at least 1 min) using Excel 2003 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). All rates were corrected for the inner filter effect using an empirical correction.34 In inhibition studies, the concentration of APE was varied from 0 mM to 10 mM and the concentration of peptidic substrate was varied from 16 mM to 100 mM. These substrate and inhibitor concentrations were dictated by solubility limitations and the observed rates of inhibition. The rate of inactivation at each concentration of substrate and inhibitor, js, was determined by fitting equation (1)35 to the corresponding progress curve using SCIENTIST version 2.01 (Micromath Scientific Software, Salt Lake City, UT). The parameters of inactivation, kinact and Ki, were evaluated by fitting equation (2) to the js obtained at each concentration of S

and I,36 using the least-squares and dynamic weighting options of LEONORA.37 Crystallization, crystal soaking and cryo-protection Before crystallization, both SARS-CoV M pro and were dialyzed against 20 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), and concentrated to 10 mg/ml. All crystals were grown at ambient temperature by the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method. For the C2 crystals, the reservoir solution contained 50 mM ammonium acetate, 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (Mr 10,000), 3% ethylene glycol, 3% dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.1 mM Mes (pH 6.5). The drop contained equal amounts of the Mpro solution and the reservoir solution. Block-shaped crystals grew in two to three days to a size of about 0.1 mm!0.1 mm!0.1 mm. For the P212121 crystals, the reservoir solution had essentially the same composition as that for the C2 crystals, except the replacement of 5% polyethylene glycol (Mr 10,000) and 3% dimethyl sulfoxide by 6% polyethylene glycol (Mr 8000). The drop contained equal pro amounts of the MCAðK1Þ solution and the reservoir solution. Needle-shaped crystals grew in three to five days to a size of about 0.05 mm!0.05 mm!0.5 mm. Crystals of good quality were selected and soaked overnight in drops with the same compositions as their reservoir solutions plus the APE chosen for this study at 3 mM. Cryo-protectants had essentially the same compositions as reservoir solutions, except for the inclusion of 25% (v/v) glycerol in the case of the C2 crystals and the increase of ethylene glycol to 25% in the case of the P212121 crystals. Crystals were briefly soaked and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage and shipment to the synchrotron beamline.

Data collection and processing, structure solution, refinement and analysis The X-ray diffraction data from all crystals were collected at the synchrotron Beamline 8.3.1 (equipped with an ADSC-Q210 CCD detector) at the Advanced Light Source in the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. All data sets were indexed, scaled and merged using DENZO and SCALEPACK.38 Structure solution and refinement were carried out in CCP4.39,40 All structures were solved by the molecular replacement method,41 using the structure of unbound SARS-CoV Mpro at pH 8.0 in the space group P21 (PDB accession code 1UK2)13 as the search model for the structure of unbound Mpro in the space group C2, and the structure of unbound Mpro in the space group C2 as the search model for the structure of the Mpro:APE complex in the space group C2 and pro the structure of the MCAðK1Þ :APE complex in the space group P212121. The structures of unbound Mpro and the pro MCAðK1Þ :APE complex were solved using AMoRe,42 and pro the structure of the MCAðK1Þ :APE complex was solved 43 using MOLREP.
