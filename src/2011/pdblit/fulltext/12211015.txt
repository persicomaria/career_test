ABSTRACT Erythrocytes of the marine annelid, Glycera dibranchiata, contain a mixture of monomeric and polymeric hemoglobins. There are three major monomer hemoglobin components, II, III, IV (also called GMH2, 3, and 4), that have been highly purified and well characterized. We have now crystallized GMH3 and GMH4 and determined their structures to 1.4 ­1.8 Å resolution. The structures were determined for these two monomer hemoglobins in the oxidized (Fe3 , ferric, or met-) forms in both the unligated and cyanide-ligated states. This work differs from two published, refined structures of a Glycera dibranchiata monomer hemoglobin, which has a sequence that is substantially different from any bona fide major monomer hemoglobins (GMH2, 3, or 4). The high-resolution crystal structures (presented here) and the previous NMR structure of CO-ligated GMH4, provide a basis for interpreting structure/function details of the monomer hemoglobins. These details include: (1) the strong correlation between temperature factor and NMR dynamics for respective protein forms; (2) the unique nature of the HisE7Leu primary sequence substitutions in GMH3 and GMH4 and their impact on cyanide ion binding kinetics; (3) the LeuB10Phe difference between GMH3 and GMH4 and its impact on ligand binding; and (4) elucidation of changes in the structural details of the distal and proximal heme pockets upon cyanide binding.

Key words: crystal structure; Glycera dibranchiata; monomer; hemoglobin; cyanomethemoglobin INTRODUCTION The coelomic erythrocytes of the marine annelid Glycera dibranchiata, commonly named the "blood worm," contain a mixture of monomeric and polymeric hemoglobins.1­14 Interest in these proteins originated in 1972 when the first primary sequence was published and indicated, by sequence alignment, an exceptional amino acid substitution of His E7 by Leu.15 This was the first natural globin in which sequence comparisons indicated the presence of a nonpolar E7 amino acid side chain. This exceptional substitution was subsequently confirmed by the first crys©

tal structure in 1974.16 Whereas the functional implications of this substitution were immediately clear, the true extent of the globin heterogeneity present in these cells was unrecognized.15­23 Vinogradov and co-workers1 were the first to separate the G. dibranchiata erythrocyte contents into monomeric and polymeric hemoglobins, but further realization of extensive heterogeneity in the monomeric globin fraction was not recognized until the work of Parkhurst et al.2 and our group.3­ 8,11­14 A clear picture of the extent of globin heterogeneity in this organism has emerged only recently, as a result of primary sequencing5,6 and mass spectrometry.5­7 Those results have confirmed the individual uniqueness and homogeneity of the three major monomer hemoglobins, called components II, III, and IV (or alternatively GMH2, 3, and 4) that have been reproducibly isolated and characterized in this laboratory.3­ 8,11­14,24 ­39 Recently, the solution structure of the CO-ligated Fe2 (reduced, ferrous)

form of recombinant GMH4 (GMH4CO) was determined,38,39 making it the first structure to be determined of one of our highly characterized monomer hemoglobins. The NMR structure confirmed the presence of Leu58(E7) and also identified an unusual Phe31(B10) in the GMH4 heme pocket. The importance of Leu replacing the distal E7 histidine derives from the fact that His(E7) is highly conserved throughout the globin superfamily40 ­ 43 and is the amino acid positioned closest to heme-bound ligands.43­ 45 In vertebrate globins, Leu(B10) is also highly conserved. Sequence alignments based on modeling and on the GMH4CO solution structure have indicated that all three major monomer hemoglobins (GMH2, GMH3, GMH4) possess Leu(E7), but that only GMH4 possesses Phe(B10).5,6,38,39 Natural Leu(E7) occurs primarily in invertebrate globins,40 ­ 46 although recombinant myoglobins in which His(E7) has been changed to nonpolar residues, including Leu, have been instrumental in elucidating functional roles of the E7 amino acid in globins.43,46 ­ 49 Such roles include a physiological one in which His(E7) donates a hydrogen bond to heme bound O2.43­ 45 Replacement of His(E7) by amino acids with nonpolar side chains (e.g., Leu) eliminates the possibility of hydrogen bonding to heme ligands and also changes the heme pocket polarity.43,46 ­ 49 Many studies have demonstrated effects on ligand binding and autooxidation that result from both position-E7 and position-B10 amino acid substitutions in myoglobins and hemoglobins.43,46 ­50 It is clear from such work that Leu(E7) and Phe(B10), both of which occur in GMH4, affect the dynamics and affinity of Fe2 heme-globins for CO and O2, and of Fe3 hemeglobins for CN and N3 . This makes it important to determine the GMH3 and GMH4 structures in order to provide a structural basis for interpreting the cyanide binding kinetics for ferric GMH2­ 4,31,32 the only kinetics so far determined for our preparations of these monomer hemoglobins. Here we report X-ray crystal structures of Fe3 forms of both GMH3 and GMH4 in CN-ligated and unligated states to 1.4 ­1.8 Å resolution. These are naturally isolated not recombinant proteins. Whereas the ferric forms are not physiologically functional, the rationale for determining these structures is that the heme paramagnetism of both unligated and CN-ligated GMH proteins has been most useful in previous extensive NMR studies3,4,13,14,28,29,33,35­37 and that cyanide binding kinetics have been measured for these proteins.31,32 Structural and dynamics studies of native and recombinant GMH proteins are continuing, hence these structures will provide an important standard by which to compare and interpret future results. Further, the heme Fe-CN unit and the physiologically relevant Fe-CO unit are thought to be isostructural. For myoglobins and hemoglobins, previous studies revealed that protein structure depends only slightly on the oxidation state of heme iron. Our structural studies have been further stimulated by discoveries in the course of sequencing these proteins,5,6 which revealed that the original crystal structure of a G. dibranchiata monomer hemoglobin,16 OCS (no pdb code

reported), very likely corresponds to our GMH2.5 In contrast, two further refined crystal structures, given pdb codes 2HBG and 1HBG,51,52 have a common sequence, which is, however, different from GMH2, 3, or 4 by 5­9 amino acids each.5,6 Adding to this peculiarity are the results of mass spectrometric analyses of samples of crystals and mother liquor that are similar to the ones from which the previous crystal structures (OCS, 1HBG, 2HBG) were determined. These mass spectrometry results showed that both crystals and mother liquor contained as many as 11 individual monomeric protein components.7 Combined with the comparatively low-resolution isolation procedure previously employed,16,51,52 where crystals were grown from the unresolved mixture of monomer hemoglobins, this data suggest that the previous crystals were heterogeneous.7 On balance, it appears that at least the refined crystal structures, 1HBG and 2HBG, do not represent a single, bona fide G. dibranchiata monomer hemoglobin. It is, therefore, scientifically imperative to provide structural information for monomer hemoglobin crystals grown from well-defined and characterized homogeneous solutions of native, wild-type G. dibranchiata monomer hemoglobins. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Isolation and Purification of GMH3 and GMH4 proteins G. dibranchiata (1,000 specimens) were purchased from Maine Bait Co. (Wiscasset, ME). They were processed as previously described.3,4 Five percent of the population were randomly examined taxonomically to insure species uniformity. Monomer hemoglobin components II, III, and IV were isolated and purified as previously described.3­ 6 Briefly, the monomeric and polymeric hemoglobins were separated using a sephadex G-75 size exclusion column. For further isolation of the individual monomer hemoglobins, the monomeric fraction was applied to a CMsephadex ion exchange column. GMH2, 3, and 4 were sequentially eluted by a salt gradient (from 0 mM to 100 mM KCl). The individual hemoglobins were concentrated to about 0.5 mM in 0.1M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, using Amicon pressure ultrafiltration cells, then frozen in bulk and stored at 80°C. Prior to use, the proteins were removed to a 4°C freezer for overnight, then subsequently thawed. These proteins were oxidized to the Fe(III) forms prior to purification using potassium ferricyanide (Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA). However, subsequent to crystallization the thawed proteins were re-oxidized, followed by addition of KCN (Fisher) when necessary to make the CN-ligated forms. Buffer exchanges occurred via wash cycles in pressure ultrafiltration cells (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and these washes also served to remove residual KCN, K3FeCN6 and their reduction products. Solution conditions were initially adjusted to 25 mM NaCl, and were subsequently changed to 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.0 with 50 mM NaCl. Final protein concentrations were 10 mg/ml. GMH3 and 4 were characterized by UV-visible absorption spectra and

electrospray ionization mass spectrometry prior to crystallization to insure their homogeneity. Crystallization of Unligated and Ligated Forms of GMH3 and GMH4 Crystals of unligated GMH4 were grown by the vapor diffusion method in 5 mg/ml protein, 15% PEG 4000, 50 mM sodium acetate, and 0.1 M ammonium sulfate at pH 4.6. Drops of 4 L in size were equilibrated against a 0.6-ml reservoir buffer containing 30% PEG 4000, 100 mM sodium acetate, and 0.2M ammonium sulfate. The reddishbrown colored and thin sheet-shaped crystals of GMH4 were grown in 2 weeks. Attempts to obtain quality crystals of CN-ligated GMH3 and GMH4 directly from solution were less successful, producing crystals that diffracted to less than 3-Å resolution. Therefore, crystals of GMH4CN were made by carefully adding a KCN solution to the crystal-containing mother liquors (5 mM final) of previously unligated protein crystals. This was done without inducing significant change in the pH. Soaking the crystals resulted in a distinct crystal color change from red-brown to brighter red indicating that the ligand had diffused through the crystal, and ligated to the heme iron ion. Crystals of unligated GMH3 were grown by the vapor diffusion and micro-seeding method. Initially, only clusters of micro crystals were detected in 5 mg/ml protein, 15% PEG 8000, 50 mM sodium cacodylate, and 0.1M ammonium sulfate at pH 6.5. Micro-seeding techniques successfully produced larger crystals. Briefly, small crystals were crushed and suspended in mother liquor. The slurry of mother liquor was quick-centrifuged and inoculated to new drops with the same condition of crystallization solution except half the concentration of protein. Crystals appeared after 2 days of incubation and were fully grown in a week period. We attempted to obtain GMH3CN crystals by soaking the GMH3 crystals in mother liquor that contained KCN (5 mM). However, this did not produce ligation as determined

by the resulting electron density. Therefore, GMH3CN crystals were successfully grown by micro-seeding the unligated GMH3 crystals to the drop, which contained GMH3 protein, 5 mM KCN, and 10 mM potassium ferricyanide (Fisher) in solution. For data collection of GMH3, GMH3CN, GMH4, and GMH4CN, typical dimensions of crystals selected were 0.2 0.2 0.01 mm. Both GMH3 and GMH4 proteins were crystallized in the space group of P21, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit, which is identical to the previous crystal described by Padlan and Love.16 As mentioned above, during the crystallization trials of both GMH3 and GMH4, there were several other types of crystal lattices produced, but the crystals of primitive monoclinic cells were chosen due to their higher resolution. Data Collection, Molecular Replacement, and Crystallographic Refinement All the data sets were collected at 4°C with a Rigaku R-AXIS IIc imaging plate/CuK source. To obtain the high-resolution data, 2 was set to 15°. In the initial stage of the structure determination, the coordinate of the previous GMH structure (PDB code 2HBG), was used for the refinement with the program X-PLOR.53 Initial rigidbody refinement was carried out using from 15.0 to 3.0 Å resolution data and produced an R-value of 25% in all four cases. After several cycles of positional refinement, temperature factor refinement, and simulated annealing omit map calculation, we were able to fit all residues to the electron density. R factors and final geometry of the final coordinates of GMH3, GMH4, GMH3CN, and GMH4CN are summarized in Table I. There are 81, 75, 76, and 70 water molecules assigned in the GMH3, GMH4, GMH3CN, and GMH4CN structures, respectively. All coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank: 1JF3 (GMH3 unligated), 1JF4 (GMH4 unligated), 1JL6 (GMH4CN), and 1JL7 (GMH3CN).

The primary sequence number is shown at the top and differences among all six sequences are noted by asterisks. The sequences are: Partial, which represents the first sequence information on a G. dibranchiata monomer hemoglobin22; OGS, which represents the original sequence15; 1HBG52; and GMH2, 3, 4.5,6

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Background G. dibranchiata monomer hemoglobin components III (GMH3) and IV (GMH4) were successfully crystallized in the oxidized (Fe3 ) forms in the high-spin, unligated, state. These crystals were subsequently converted to cyanide-ligated forms by soaking in mother liquor containing KCN. Previously, structures of the reduced (Fe2 ) forms of a G. dibranchiata monomer hemoglobin in both high-spin, deoxy (pdb code 2HBG)51 and low-spin, CO-ligated (pdb code 1HBG)52 forms have been published. There is a caveat attached to the 1HBG/2HBG structures, which comes from the sequence differences found between actual sequences of GMH 2, 3, and 45,6 and the published sequence common to 1HBG/2HBG.51,52 Due to those sequence anomalies (Fig. 1), the structures determined in this work were carefully determined and compared to both 1HBG and 2HBG, and to the published NMR solution structure of reduced, CO-ligated recombinant GMH4 (pdb codes 1VRF, 1VRE).38,39 We have determined the GMH3 and GMH4 structures here because there is yet no structural data for them, whereas the following line of reasoning indicates that a GMH2 structure has already been solved. The original G. dibranchiata primary sequence (OGS),15 is apparently also the sequence of the original G. dibranchiata crystal structure (OCS).16 No pdb entry has been made for the OCS, and it is a comparatively low-resolution structure. However, its sequence compares favorably with the primary sequence of our GMH2 in the following ways.5­7 (1)

The calculated mass of OGS (14,978.3 Da) is nearly identical to the calculated (14,981.3 Da) and experimental (14,981.2 Da) masses of GMH2.5,7 (2) Using the GMH2 sequence as a guide,5 if one takes the OGS and appropriately substitutes either Gln or Glu for the several ambiguous Glx designated in OGS, then the two sequences are identical and the OCS must, therefore, represent the structure of GMH2. Sequence Comparisons As indicated above, primary sequences of the isolated monomer hemoglobins GMH2, 3, and 4 differ from each other and from the published primary sequence of the existing refined crystal structures, 1HBG and 2HBG, which have the same sequence. These differences are summarized in Figure 1. We correct a previous typographical error by stating that GMH3/GMH4 differ by eight amino acids, not seven.5 Comparing GMH3 with the 1HBG(2HBG) sequence, one finds seven primary sequence differences and comparing GMH4 with 1HBG, one finds nine differences. Those comparisons explicitly exclude Glu/Gln/Glx ambiguities.5 In comparing all published G. dibranchiata monomer hemoglobin sequences (reference5 and this work) there are differences (excluding Q/E) at 15 different primary sequence positions (10.2%; Fig. 1). In order to emphasize these primary sequence differences, we have unambiguously identified them in electron density maps. Examples for GMH3 are shown in Figure 2.

Fig. 2. Electron density maps of selected side chains in GMH3. These represent ten of the amino acids that are not conserved among the six sequences shown in Figure 1. The primary sequence position of each is noted and corresponds to positions marked by asterisks in Figure 1.

Global Structures: General The C atoms of GMH3, GMH4, GMH3CN, and GMH4CN are all essentially superimposable, as demonstrated by the small (0.14 ­ 0.26 Å) rms deviations (rmsd). The overall structures of these proteins are also similar to the corresponding unligated 2HBG and CO-ligated 1HBG structures. The global shape for GMH4 is illustrated in Figure 3. The global shapes of GMH3 (GMH3CN) and GMH4 (GMH4CN) are essentially identical and are myoglobin-like. They are flat dish shapes consisting of seven helices (labeled A, B, C, E, F, G, and H) instead of the eight helices that are normal for vertebrate myoglobins. Any structural semblance of a D-helix is now confirmed to be missing in both of these proteins as previously noted for the OCS (GMH2).16 The secondary structure elements (helices, turns) are identically located, starting and ending at the same primary sequence positions in both GMH3/GMH3CN and GMH4/GMH4CN. Six of the eight primary sequence differences between GMH3 and GMH4 occur early in the primary sequence, within sequence positions 20 ­ 40 (Fig. 1). Five of these occur at the end of the B helix (positions 31, 32, 35) or at the beginning of the C helix (positions 39, 40). Another difference occurs at position 20, which is located in the A/B turn. Most of the GMH3/GMH4 amino acid differences are surface exposed amino acids, with the exception of position-31 (B10), which is Leu in GMH3 and Phe in GMH4. Phe31(B10) extends into the heme pocket and its role as a distal residue will be illuminated in a later discussion of the heme pocket and its structural response to CN-ligation. However, the Phe31(GMH4)/Leu31(GMH3) difference does impact the global structures of GMH4 and GMH3 as reflected in slightly different positioning of the B-helix with respect to its distance from the heme. The difference is most pronounced for the ligated proteins (GMH3CN, GMH4CN), but in both ligated and unligated proteins the B-helix is positioned farther from its closest heme contact

for GMH4/GMH4CN, compared to GMH3/GMH3CN. This may be an accommodation for the larger steric bulk of Phe31 in the heme pocket. We illustrate it by comparing distances between Phe31 or Leu31 C and C atoms to their closest heme contact, heme C4B (Fig. 4). Comparing the unligated proteins, one finds that Phe31 C (GMH4) lies 0.12 Å farther from its closest heme contact atom (7.44 Å) than does the Leu31 C (GMH3, 7.32 Å). Comparable residue-31 C distances to heme C4B are 9.48 Å (GMH4, Phe31) and 9.30 Å (GMH3, Leu31), a difference of 0.18 Å. For the CN-ligated proteins these same distance differences are larger and also indicate movement of the B-helix away from the heme in GMH4CN. The difference in C -C4B distance for GMH4CN(Phe31) compared to GMH3CN(Leu31) is 0.58 Å. The C -C4B difference is 0.54 Å. Significant structural changes caused by cyanide ligation are primarily found in the distal side of the heme pocket, with little global conformational changes (vide infra). Details of heme pocket changes caused by CN ligation will be described later. Global Structure: GMH3CN, GMH4CN, and 1HBG (GHbCO) Leaving aside for the moment issues related to the heme, heme ligands, PheB10, and LeuE7, which will be discussed in detail later, we address more comprehensive structural features of the three ligated structures. This comparison offers structural insights even though the oxidation state of 1HBG is different from GMH3CN and GMH4CN. We believe that these comparisons are meaningful for the following reasons. (1) All three proteins are low-spin. (2) All three proteins are six-coordinate. (3) Both heme ligands are diatomic: CN for GMH3CN and GMH4CN, and CO for 1HBG. Overall rmsd values (C atoms only), which reflect the structural changes upon cyanide ligand binding, are 0.14 for GMH3/GMH3CN and 0.15 Å GMH4/GMH4CN. Thus,

there are only small global changes for each protein caused by ligation. The differences between the CN-ligated structures presented here and the previously published GHbCO structure (1HBG) are larger. After least squares fitting, the overall rmsd values of C atoms of GMH3CN/1HBG and GMH4CN/1HBG pair-wise comparisons are 0.52 and 0.54, respectively, which are each larger than the value of 0.19 obtained from the GMH3CN/GMH4CN comparison. Individual C atom rmsd's derived from comparisons of GMH3CN/1HBG and GMH4CN/1HBG are shown by graphical presentation in Figure 5. These data show that,

overall, the most similar rmsd's for all three pairwise comparisons are found in the E, G, and H helices. The general trend for the helical regions is that the lowest rmsd's occur for the GMH3CN/GMH4CN comparison, denoted by solid diamonds in Figure 5. The rmsd's for GMH3CN/1HBG and GMH4CN/1HBG comparisons are invariably larger. However, in keeping with the previous discussion of the displaced B helix in GMH4 vs. GMH3 (vide supra), the GMH4CN/GMH3CN and GMH4CN/ 1HBG rmsd's are larger than the GMH3/1HBG rmsd in the B helix region (primary sequence 30 ­38). In contrast to the helical regions and to some of the turn regions where the GMH3CN/GMH4CN comparisons yield the lowest rmsd's, large and nearly identical rms deviations occur in AB, EF, FG, and GH turn regions for GMH3CN/1HBG and GMH4CN/1HBG comparisons. The largest differences in both sets of pair-wise comparisons with 1HBG occur in the sequence region 90 ­98 (FG loop), a conserved sequence in all GMH2, 3, and 4 proteins.5 This region includes the heme-bound proximal histidine, His90(F8). The 1HBG structure reveals maximum deviation from either GMH3CN or GMH4CN near the residue Lys96. Such an unusual difference between C atoms is hard to rationalize except by proposing that the backbones of at least amino acids Gly94 to His97 were mistraced into the electron density of the corresponding side chains in 1HBG (and in 2HBG) (Fig. 6).

Global Structure: Temperature Factors and NMR Dynamics Graphs of backbone atom temperature (B) factors for all four structures determined here are shown in Figure 7 and generally correlate with backbone temperature factors for 1HBG.39,52 Elevated temperature factors are found for all turns. However, the largest B factors for our structures and for 1HBG39,52 correspond to AB, FG, and GH turns. For GMH4 and GMH4CN (compared to GMH3 and GMH3CN), high B factors are found for the AB and FG turns. We previously compared the NMR structures of recombinant GMH4CO (1VRE, 1VRF) with 1HBG.39 This revealed regions with high crystallographic B factors in 1HBG that

correlated with identical regions in recombinant GMH4CO (1VRE, 1VRF), which either had lower relaxation-based generalized order parameters (reflecting enhanced motions over 10 9­10 12 s), or had measurable chemical exchange terms, Rex, (representing enhanced motions on the time scale of 10 3­10 6 s).39 The NMR data further supported the concept of highly flexible turns by the fact that these regions displayed very rapid amide proton H/D (isotope) exchange (low protection factors).39 It is now apparent that Figures 5 and 7 are highly similar to Figure 3E in reference,39 for structures 1VRE, 1VRF, and 1HBG. This may indicate that correlations between RMSD, B factor, and motional measures can be extended to the structures presented here. In this perspective, it is likely, then, that enhanced motional characteristics of the FG

turn may have been a contributing source to the electron density tracing error in 1HBG. Heme Environment: Heme In all four structures the electron density of heme is well defined, extending throughout both propionate groups. In both ligated and unligated forms of GMH3 and GMH4, the propionate of pyrrole A (Fischer: propionate 7) participates in two hydrogen bonds, with Arg89 and Tyr93, as previously described.52 In contrast, the pyrrole D propionate (Fischer: propionate 6) is apparently more flexible in that it adopts slightly different conformations in each structure, showing hydrogen bonding only to water molecules. Proximal Heme Environment In all of the structures determined here, both ligated and unligated, the heme iron ion is coordinated to a

proximal histidine, His90(F8) (Fig. 8), which also hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen of Val86(F4), a central residue of the F-helix. In this respect, GMH3 and GMH4 mimic vertebrate myoglobins and hemoglobins,43,54,55 which have similar proximal histidine hydrogen bonding. It has been observed that this type of hydrogen bond could couple ligand binding to the entire F helix as a mechanism to propagate cooperativity. This would be an unnecessary function in the G. dibranchiata monomer hemoglobins given the observation of only small global structure changes upon ligation51,52 (vide supra) and the lack of cooperativity in these monomer hemoglobins.19,56 Rather, the function of this hydrogen bond may be to stabilize the heme pocket and perhaps to govern the rotational position and tilt of the proximal histidine's imidazole side chain. The environment around the proximal side of the heme and His90 consists of the same amino acids in GMH3 and

GMH4. In contrast to the distal side (discussed later), the proximal heme environment is polar, containing Tyr93, Tyr102, Lys99, and Gln65. Distal Heme Environment Seven amino acids make van der Waals contact with the heme in both unligated and ligated forms of GMH3 and GMH4. In this distal environment, only one of these amino acids (Lys61), situated at the heme periphery, has a polar side chain. The ligand binding site and central heme pocket of both GMH3 and GMH4 are lined completely with amino acids that have nonpolar, nonhydrogen bonding hydrophobic side chains: Phe31(GMH4CN)/Leu31(GMH3CN), Phe45, Leu58, Val62, and Ile66. The preponderance of hydrophobic amino acid side chains distal to the heme imparts a highly nonpolar nature to the ligandbinding pocket. The fact that neither unligated nor ligated GMH3 or GMH4 contain heme pocket water molecules may be attributed to this hydrophobic environment of the heme pocket. Phe45 corresponds to the CD1 structural position in vertebrate hemoglobins and myoglobins,54,55 and plays an essential role in heme-globin affinity. Phe(CD1) is also among the most highly conserved amino acids in the vertebrate globins,40 ­ 43,54,55 but is less so in invertebrates. Together, Phe(CD1) and Phe(CD4) in vertebrate myoglobins and hemoglobins provide hydrophobic stabilization of the heme, influence the polarity of the ligand binding site, and perhaps help orient the C/D turn. In this respect, both GMH3 and GMH4 resemble the vertebrate globins. In addition to Phe45, both have Phe47, which, respectively, fulfill the corresponding CD1 and CD4 roles and lie co-planar to the heme in these structures. Here, we find that in both ligation states of GMH3 and GMH4 all amino acids that constitute the distal ligandbinding pocket are well defined by a single conformation (Fig. 8). This is in contrast to analysis of 1HBG and 2HBG, where it was reported that Leu31(B10) was found to display conformational disorder.51,52 In those two cases, the electron density map was interpreted in terms of multiple rotamers, which are not observed in our structures of these proteins. Effects of Cyanide Ligation The most significant structural rearrangements upon CN-ligation for both GMH3 and GMH4 occur for the side chain of Leu58(E7), which is located at the position corresponding to the distal His(E7) in myoglobins and hemoglobins (Fig. 8). In both GMH3 and GMH4, Leu58

moves away from the heme Fe3 ion in response to cyanide ion binding, with the extent of the movement being larger in GMH4, as demonstrated in Figure 8. This motion shifts Leu58 away from the heme center and toward the heme periphery, to accommodate the cyanide ligand. In GMH4, this movement involves a twisting motion about the Leu58 C -C bond. The extent of ligation-induced shift, measured by the distance between Leu58 C 1 and the heme Fe3 ion, is 0.39 Å for GMH3/GMH3CN and 2.10 Å for GMH4/GMH4CN. Whereas Leu58 undergoes large repositioning as a consequence of cyanide binding, several other distal heme pocket amino acids exhibit smaller ligation-induced motions. For example, in both GMH3CN and GMH4CN the Val62(E11) C atoms have moved away from the heme Fe3 ion, but only by 0.12­ 0.17 Å. Phe45(CD1) has moved slightly closer to the heme upon CN binding, with its nearest atoms (C 1 and C 1) residing closer to the iron ion by 0.15­ 0.40 Å in both GMH3CN and GMH4CN. The motions of the two position-31(B10) amino acids (Phe and Leu) in the different proteins is best characterized as rotational, with part of the side chains moving slightly away from the heme iron ion while the complementary part of the side chain is repositioned closer to the heme iron ion (Fig. 8). In contrast to these cyanide ligation induced rearrangements of the distal amino acids (particularly Leu58(E7)), the same amino acids displayed little conformational or position changes upon CO-ligation when 1HBG and 2HBG were compared.51,52 However, the significant rearrangement of Leu58 upon CN-ligand binding to GMH3 and GMH4 is consistent with independently observed shifts of the corresponding His58(E7) upon CO-binding in Fe2 myoglobin structures (1A6N and 1A6G, 1BZP, and 1BZR). Cyanide and Proximal Histidine Orientation Heme coordinated cyanide and the imidazole plane of the proximal histidine (His90) are oriented similarly in GMH3CN and GMH4CN. The His90(F8) imidazole plane aligns nearly along the axis defined by the heme (Pyrrole B)N-Fe-N(Pyrrole D) axis (Figs. 4, 8). The cyanide ligand's position is less precise, exhibiting a slightly delocalized electron density in a plane nearly perpendicular to the His90 imidazole plane. This isotropic variation in the CON bond vector positions the cyanide ligand toward a gap between Phe31/Leu31 (B10) and Leu62(E11) in one direction and toward Leu58(E7) in the other (Fig. 8). The distances presented in Table II reveal that the Phe31OCN contacts are closer in GMH4CN than are the Leu31-CN

contacts in GMH3CN. This increased steric crowding is the likely cause of the larger Leu58 motion in GMH4/ GMH4CN, as shown in Figure 8. The observed delocalized electron density for hemebound CN could be a reflection of dynamic ligand mobility. Such mobility has precedent in CO bound to heme proteins, such as in CO-myoglobin in which four distinct conformational subpopulations have been identified (references57­ 60 and references therein). Relevant to this point are structural data for several monomeric CN-ferriheme proteins61,62 in which all exhibit an FeOCON angle less than 180°. In these cases, the ligand also appears "tilted," in the sense that the His90ONe2OFeOC(N) angle is also less than 180°. Similar ligand tilting and bending were found for the FeOCO unit of CO-ligated ferroheme proteins (references59,60 and references therein). For COligated proteins, this has been interpreted in terms of a potential energy surface accessed by coupled vibrational motions of the heme FeOCOO group.59 In view of the similarity of FeCO and FeCN units and their similar bent and tilted geometries, it may be reasonable to expect similar vibration/conformation coupling of FeOCN in GMH3CN and GMH4CN. Such motions likely contribute to fluctuations in the CN ligand's geometry in GMH3CN and GMH4CN. Structural Rationalization of CN Binding Kinetics Having identified the structural features of the GMH2­ 4 heme pocket, it is now possible to rationalize the extremely slow cyanide binding kinetics of these proteins.31,32 For the structurally similar myoglobins, it is known that the dynamics of small molecule binding (CO, O2, CN , N3 ) are affected by the identity of the CD4, B10, E7, and E11 amino acids.43,46 ­50 Unusual ligand binding dynamics are reported for the G. dibranchiata monomer hemoglobins,27,31,32 for which unusual amino acid substitutions occur at E7 (GMH2­ 4) and B10 (GMH4 only). These results can now be understood on the basis of the paradigm established by the comprehensive work on the myoglobin point mutants43,46 ­50 and the current structures. Comparison of cyanide binding rates for met-WT sperm whale myoglobin (SW-Mb), several ferric SW-Mb point mutants, and the met forms of GMH2­ 4 are given in Table III. There is no HisE7 point mutant available for GMH 2­ 4 so comparisons can only be made to the structurally similar WT SW-Mb with HisE7. The comparisons in Table IIIB show that HisE7 enhances the cyanide binding rate in ferric SW-Mb by 170 times over LeuE7. This explains the observation of vastly lowered on-rates for CN-binding to the ferric forms of GMH2­ 4.31,32 The data show that CN-binding is 456 ­1,126 times higher in ferric SW-Mb than in the monomer hemoglobins, a trend identical to the SW-Mb point mutant. Whereas Leu58(E7) explains the very slow cyanide binding rates of GMH2­ 4, there is also differentiation in the rates between GMH2 and GMH3 on the one hand, and GMH4 on the other. This is correlated with the fact that GMH4 contains the unusual Phe31(B10), whereas both GMH2 and GMH3 possess the usual Leu31(B10), similar

to SW-Mb. The data in Table III, and for many SW-Mb point mutants,43,46 ­50 show that a Phe(B10) actually enhances the rate of cyanide binding. In ferric SW-Mb, a Phe(B10) mutant binds cyanide 2.6 times faster than the wild type protein (Leu(B10)). Comparing GMH4 to GMH2 and GMH3 shows that the rate increases for Phe(B10)containing GMH4 are 3.7 and 6.0 times, respectively, a trend identical to that found in SW-Mb. Summary Determining the X-ray structures of the unligated and CN-ligated ferric forms of GMH3 and GMH4 has resolved long-standing uncertainties. These structures are now being used as a rational basis for the design of mutant proteins to probe functional and spectroscopic properties.
