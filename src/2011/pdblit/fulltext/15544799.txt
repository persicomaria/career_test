An analysis using the database searcla and multiple alignment program PROBE' revealed that these proteins share sequence similarity with many other proteins (Fig. I), including the ~r~~o~~~~o adhesion molecule pollux' the human , We-2 oncogene protein5 and, notably, two GTPase-activating proteins (GAPS) from yeast, similarity 0 everal members of this superfamily has been previously noted", but not its similarity to these two GAPS. CAPS enhance the inherently slow GTPase activily of Ras-like proteins, which function as binary molecular switches ~[)~at~~~l~j~l~ ceffular pathways' . In this way, GAPs turn off these switches by inducing conversion of bound GTP to GDP. The switch is turned on by guanine nucfeotlde exchange factors, which promote the exchange of bound GDP for

free GTP. The Ypt proteins in yeast and the related Rab proteins in mammals
belong to a family of GTPases that direct the transport of vesicles in the secretory and endocytic pathwayss.Y. Gyp6p and Gyp7p are activators of the Ypt GTPases Ypt6p and Ypt7p, respectivelytOu. Ypt6p regulates vesicle trafficking either between the ER and the Golgi or at an early step within the Golgi". and Ypt7p is required in the homotypic fusion step of vacuole inheritance, where it may function as a switch for turning on the vacuole fusion machinery' s. As CiypSp and Ciyp7p are both regulators of vesicle trafficking, other less-characterized proteins in the Bub2p may perform similar superfamily functions. For example, the polfux protein - in addition to being produced in a number of other tissues at various times during development - is required to maintain structural integrity between the tracheal epithelium and the

Representative alignment of sequences related to the Bub2p protem. Starbng with a hypothetical protein (P48666), the PROBE program3 detected and aligfled about 40 distinct sequences from the 10 March. 1997 release of the NCBI non-redundant database. Conserved residues are highlighted, with weakly or moderately conserved residues in black, highly conserved positions in red and invariant, or nearly invariant, positions in yellow. A blank row in an alighed block indicates that the sequence lacks a significant match to that motif. (The sequence 409445 occurs only in the upper alignment because it shares significant similanty with other superfamily members only in these regions.) The Gyp6p and Gyp7p proteins share sequence similarity to other superfamily members at the P = 0.00002 and P = 0.004 levels of statistical significance, respectively. These Pvalues were determined as follows: a PROBE alignment was created using superfamily members lacking detectable pairwise similarity to the sequence in question. Then, this alignment was used to search the protein database using a co-linear version of the SCAN programzO; SCAN finds the best match to each sequence and computes a conservative e-value estimate using the method of Staden' l (with an adjustment for mult!ple hypotheses).

down during apolysis, a process that is triggered by the release of ECMdegrading enzymes from the epithelium and that leads to shedding of the cuticler4. In light of its similarity to GypSp and Gyp7p, it is tempting to speculate that pollux prevents premature initiation of apolysis by regulating the secretory pathway associated with these degradative

enzymes. Moreover, poilux contains several ECM and cell adhesion motifs (in addition to the Bub2p motifs) including an RGD recognition/attachment siter5,`" that functions as an integrin ligand". (Similar motifs occur in the human oncTRE17 protein4s5.)Thus, pollux may provide a link between integrin and downstream CTPases, which are known to be involved in integrin-mediated signaling pathways".` *.

Whether the conserved regions within GypGp and Cyp7p correspond to their GAP domains or to some other domain is unclear, but, in either case, the similarity of these proteins to BubZp suggests a possible mechanism for coordinating mitosis with other aspects of the cell cycle, including organelle inheritance (reviewed in Ref. 19) and septum formation?. Indeed, if checkpoints are needed for organelle inheritance, as well as for mitosis, as has been suggestedlg, then these processes need to be coordinated to ensure that both chromosomes and organelles are correctly duplicated and partitioned during cell division. Furthermore, experimental analysis of the proteins in this superfamily (many members of which are currentlv uncharacterized) should enhance our understanding in this regard.
