Ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco; EC 4.1.1.39) is the most abundant enzyme on our planet and plays one of the most important roles in our ecosystem. It catalyzes the covalent addition of carbon dioxide to ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate, producing two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA) (Fig. 1). The function and the abundance of the enzyme provide a major link between inorganic and organic carbon in our biosphere. The fixed carbon is then converted into sugars and other cell material, which will ultimately be utilized as the carbon and energy source of virtually all heterotrophic organisms. The significance of Rubisco has attracted scientists for decades, consequently leading to an extraordinary accumulation of knowledge on the enzyme. ~ 5 Rubisco is found predominantly in higher plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and photosynthetic bacteria. In these organisms, Rubisco has been found to catalyze a second reaction in the presence of oxygen; ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate and oxygen are converted to one molecule of 3PGA and one

molecule of 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG) (Fig. 1). 2PG is metabolized oxidatively in the glycolate pathway, thereby leading to a significant decrease in net efficiency of photosynthesis. The ratio of carboxylase and oxygenase activities is called the r value and is defined as in Eq. (1).
z = Vcgo/VoKc = vc[O2]/vo[C02]

A higher r value represents a higher specificity for the carboxylase activity and, as Rubisco catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the Calvin cycle, one can expect a higher efficiency in carbon dioxide fixation. Although many attempts to elevate the r value of Rubisco by protein engineering have been reported, very few, 6 if any, have actually succeeded in obtaining

an engineered Rubisco with a significant increase in the r value. 7-~ The same difficulties have been found with another property of Rubisco for which improvement is sought, its low specific activity. The turnover rate of a typical Rubisco is a mere three per second, a In most organisms, Rubisco is a hexadecamer consisting of eight large (L) and eight small (S) subunits in an L8S8 arrangement (type I or form 1). Another type of Rubisco, found in some photosynthetic B-purple bacteria such as Rhodospirillum rubrum, is a homodimer of L subunits only (type II or form 2). 12-14Rhodobacter sphaeroides, 15,16R. capsbllatus, 17 and the nonphotosynthetic chemoautotrophic B-purple bacterium Thiobacillus den#riftcans TMharbor both type I and type II Rubiscos. In addition to their subunit compositions, the two types can be classified by their primary structure relatedness. 4 Large subunits of the same type show a similarity of 70% or higher, whereas those of a different type show a similarity of approximately 50%.

ing frames encoding proteins that showed similarity to previously known Rubiscos. We also detected a similar gene on the chromosome of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 (classified previously as Pyrococcus kodakaraensis KOD1). 21 Similar putative Rubisco genes have also been found in Pyrococcus abyssi (http://www. genoscope.cns.fr/cgi-bin/Pab.cgi) and P. horikoshii. 22 These genes showed only 50% similarity to both type I and type II Rubiscos, suggesting that these genes encoded Rubiscos of a novel type, and whether they actually harbor Rubisco activity was an important question to address. We previously provided the first evidence that the putative Rubisco gene of T. kodakaraensis KOD1 indeed encoded a protein with Rubisco activity and that the protein was present in native host cells.21 Gene Structure The Rubisco gene of T. kodakaraensis KOD1 (Tk-rbcl) has a length of 1332 bp, encoding a protein (Tk-Rubisco) of 444 amino acid residues. The predicted molecular mass of the protein is 49.7kDa. Compared with the amino acid sequences of previously reported type I and type II enzymes, Tk-Rubisco shows 51.4% similarity with spinach Rubisco 23 and 47.3% similarity with the type II enzyme from R. rubrum,13 suggesting that Tk-Rubisco does not belong to either type. In contrast, Tk-Rubisco shows 81.9% similarity with the putative Rubisco RBCL-2 of A. fulgidus. Tk-Rubisco also shows 61.3% similarity with the Rubisco from M. jannaschii, which has been proven to harbor Rubisco activity.24 Active site residues, namely Lys2°I, Asp 2°3, His TM, and LysTM of the enzyme from spinach, 25 are conserved among protein sequences of type I, type II, and archaeal Rubiscos. A phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) clearly indicates the distinct structures of archaeal Rubiscos in comparison with the type I and type II enzymes. Gene Expression Protein engineering of Rubiscos from higher plants has been hampered constantly by difficulties in producing active recombinant proteins in Esch21 S. Ezaki, N. Maeda, T. Kishimoto, H.

zymes, can be obtained as recombinant proteins in their functional forms. 3~ Like the bacterial enzymes, the recombinant form of Tk-Rubisco can be obtained by expressing the Tk-rbcl gene in E. coli. 21 The gene is inserted between the NdeI and the SalI sites of the vector pET21a(+) (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI), which harbors a T7 promoter and lac operator. The expression plasmid is then introduced into E. coli BL21-competent cells (Novagen) with methods recommended by the manufacturer. Preculture of the recombinant cells is carried out in 5 ml LB medium for 12 hr at 37°, and the culture is then inoculated in 250 ml LB medium. Gene expression is induced by the addition of 0.1 mM isopropyl-/3-o-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when the cells reach an optical density of 0.4 to 0.5 at 660 nm. After 4 hr of induction, cells are harvested by centrifugation (6000g, 4 °, 10 min) and are disrupted by sonication at 20 kHz with 40 cycles of 20-sec on/10-sec off intervals (Astrason XL2020, Misonix Inc., Farmingdale, NY). A specific band with the expected molecular mass (48 kDa) can be observed on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 3). The protein product is present predominantly in the soluble fraction of the cell-free extracts. Expression levels may vary among different transformants, and preservation of recombinant clones by freezing usually decreases the protein production by over 50%. The use of freshly transformed cells is recommended. Purification of Recombinant Protein Purification procedures for recombinant enzymes from hyperthermophiles have the advantage that most proteins from the mesophilic host can be removed easily by a single heat precipitation step, which was used to obtain recombinant Tk-Rubisco. Cells from a 250-ml culture are suspended in 10 ml of 100 mM Bicine/10 mM MgC12 buffer (pH 8.3) and sonicated as described earlier. After centrifugation at 6000g for 10 min to remove insoluble debris, the supernatant is incubated at 85 ° for 30 min, which is sufficient to precipitate most of the proteins from E. coli (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). The major portion of recombinant Tk-Rubisco remains in the supernatant after centrifugation at 17,000g for 10 min. The supernatant is applied at a flow rate of 5.0 ml/min to an anion-exchange ResourceQ column (Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), with a bed volume of 6 ml. Recombinant Tk-Rubisco is eluted with a 0 to 1.0 M NaC1 gradient within a volume of 90 ml of 100 mM bicine/10 mM MgC12 buffer. TkRubisco is eluted from the column at a salt concentration of approximately

In order to prepare a protein sample for the production of polyclonal antibodies, a further purification step is carried out using gel-filtration chromatography. A volume of 100 /zl of Tk-Rubisco (10 mg/ml) is applied to a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia) in 50 mM sodium phosphate/0.15 M NaC1 buffer (pH 7.0) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.

quencer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), is Val-GluLys-Phe-Asp-Thr-Ile-Tyr-Asp-Tyr-Tyr. This is identical to the sequence predicted from the gene except that it begins with the second amino acid residue, suggesting that the terminal methionine is processed by E. coli. It is not known whether this is the case in T. kodakaraensis. The molecular mass and subunit composition of the recombinant enzyme are determined by gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia). Tk-Rubisco has a molecular mass of approximately 450 kDa, which is about nine times larger than that of the monomer subunit. Taking into account the results of preliminary X-ray crystallography studies, Tk-Rubisco is an L10-type homodecamer with a pentagonal structure. 32 Activity Measurements The catalytic activity of purified Tk-Rubisco is measured under an anaerobic environment saturated with carbon dioxide. This is achieved by bubbling ultrapure carbon dioxide gas through a sealed vial. In a typical assay, 3.7/zg of enzyme in 40/zl of 100 mM Bicine-KOH (pH 8.3)/10 mM MgCl2 buffer and 10/zl of 15 mM ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 100 mM Bicine-KOH (pH 8.3) buffer are incubated separately under a 100% CO2 atmosphere at the desired temperature for 4 and i min, respectively. The two solutions are then mixed by pipetting to initiate the reaction, which is carried out for I0 min. The products of the carboxylase reaction are two molecules of 3PGA per RuBP, whereas in the oxygenase reaction, one molecule of 3PGA and one molecule of 2PG are produced per RuBP. Both 3PGA and 2PG can be measured using an ASAHI PAK GS-220HQ column (Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan) by UV absorbance at 210 nm following separation with high-performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The flow rate is 0.8 ml/min, the oven temperature is 40°, and the elution buffer is composed of 5 mM KH2PO4, 0.1% H3PO4, and 1 mM tetra-n-butylammonium phosphate. Standards of 3PGA and 2PG are added to each assay mixture after each measurement, and an additional run is conducted in order to confirm the retention time of each compound. It should be noted that at temperatures above 60°, degradation of ribulose-l,5-bisphosphate is observed. Shorter reaction times, e.g., 5 min, are recommended to obtain consistent results at temperatures above 60°. The same method can be applied to gases with different carbon dioxide: oxygen ratios, or air. The solubilities of the carbon dioxide and oxygen 32N. Maeda,K. Kitano,T. Fukui,S. Ezaki,H. Atomi,K.

Cells (1-g wet weight) are disrupted by the addition of denaturing solution (10 ml) containing 4 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.1 M 2mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% sodium N-lauroylsarcosine at room temperature for 5 min. To this is added 1 ml of 2 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 10 ml of water-saturated acidic phenol, and 5 ml of CIA (chloroform : isoamyl alchohol, 49:1 v/v). The cell lysate is then placed on ice for 15 rain to precipitate proteins. After centrifugation at 5000g for 20 min at 4 °, an equal volume of 2-propanol is added to the supernatant to precipitate RNA. The pellet is resuspended in RNase-free water treated with diethyl pyrocarbohate at a final concentration of 0.1%. For Northern blot analysis, 25/zg of total RNA is denatured by heat treatment at 65 ° for 15 min. mRNA is separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Pharmacia) by capillary blotting. A 0.24- to 9.5-kb R N A ladder from GIBCO-BRL (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) is used as a molecular size marker.

Northern Blot Analysis
Northern blot analysis demonstrates that the Tk-Rubisco gene, Tk-rbcl, is transcribed in the native host. 21 The NdeI-SalI D N A fragment inserted in the expression vector is excised and used for construction of the probe. This fragment, corresponding to the complete open reading frame of Tkrbcl, is labeled using the DIG D N A labeling and detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Hybridization and washing conditions of the membranes are conducted according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). mRNA with a length of 1400 bases specifically hybridizes to the Tk-Rubisco probe (Fig. 5A), confirming that Tk-rbcl is transcribed in the native host. The length of Tk-rbcl is 1332 bp, showing that Tk-rbcl is transcribed as a single gene and not as a member of a multigene operon.

Western Blot Analysis
This technique is used to show that Rubisco is present in cell-free extracts of T. kodakaraensis KOD1. 21 Extracts are prepared by first removing elemental sulfur by filtration through filter paper (No. 101, Toyo Roshi). After centrifugation of the culture at 10,000g for 10 rain at 4 °, the cell pellet is suspended in Milli-Q water (MilliQeLus, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The cells will burst spontaneously. The supernatant after centrifugation (10,000g, 4 °, 10 min) is used as the cell-free extract. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies are raised against recombinant Tk-Rubisco, purified by gel-

FIG. 5. Northern blot analysis for mRNA of Tk-Rubisco (A) and Western blot analysis of Tk-Rubisco (B). (A) Twenty-five micrograms of total RNA was used for agarose gel electrophoresis. (B) Recombinant Tk-Rubisco (lane 1, 60 ng) and the cell-free extract of T. kodakaraensis KOD1 (lane 2, 60/~g) were applied to SDS-PAGE followed by blotting to the PVDF membrane.

filtration chromatography as described. Antisera diluted 1000-fold is used to detect Tk-Rubisco in cell-free extracts of T. kodakaraensis KOD1. PVDF membranes (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan) and a horizontal blotter (AE-6677, ATTO) are used for blotting. Blocking of the membrane is carried out for 1 hr at room temperature with 5% skim milk in PBS buffer (per liter): NaC1; 8.0 g; KC1, 0.2 g; NaEHPO4" 12H20, 2.9 g; and KHzPO4, 0.2 g. Incubation with primary antibodies is performed at room temperature for 1 hr. The membrane is washed four times, 5 min each, with washing buffer [25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100]. Incubation with protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugates is performed for 30 min, followed by repeated washing with washing buffer (5 min x 4 times). Detection is performed using 50 ml PBS buffer with 30/zl of 30% H 2 0 2 and 30/zl of 4CN solution (30 mg of 4-chloro-l-naphthol in 10 ml of methanol). A single band with a molecular mass corresponding to that of the recombinant protein and of the size of Tk-Rubisco deduced from its amino acid sequence (49,710 Da) is observed (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that Tk-rbcl is transcribed and translated and that the protein product, Tk-Rubisco, is present in the native host, T. kodakaraensis KOD1. At present, Tk-Rubisco is the only Rubisco protein that has been detected in a hyperthermophilic archaeon. Putative Rubisco genes have been found on the chromosomes of M. ]annaschii, 19A. fulgidus,2° P. abyssi, and P. horikoshii. 22 Biochemical characterization has been reported for the

recombinant protein from M. jannaschii, 24 but detection of the protein in its native host has not been reported. Genome analysis of M. jannaschii and A. fulgiclus has revealed the presence of putative ribose-5-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and triose-phosphate isomerase genes of the Calvin cycle. Some of the corresponding genes have also been found in P. abyssi and P. horikoshii. However, a putative ribulose-5-phosphate kinase, whose product should be the substrate of Rubisco, has not been identified in any of the strains. At present, the physiological function of Rubiscos in hyperthermophilic archaea remains unknown.
