Abstract

The crystal structure of the self-complementary DNA octamer d(GGCATGCC) has been determined to a resolution of 2.38 ]k and R factor of 17.1%. The structure is an A-DNA octamer duplex with Watson-Crick base pairing along its length. This sequence extends the investigation of octamer duplexes of the type d(GGXaCC) which assume P61 packing within the crystallographic unit cell. The A-DNA duplex is non-linear with a helix axis curvature of 7 ° and bending towards the DNA minor groove. In view of the biological importance of protein recognition of some A-DNA sequences the minor-groove geometry and helix-axis curvature for this structure is compared with all others of the type d(GGXATXCC).

1. Introduction

The structures of a number of native DNA octamer sequences have been determined by X-ray crystallography. With the exception of three sequences which contain alternating purine and pyrimidine bases and are consequently of Z-DNA type, all of these sequences crystallize as A-DNA duplexes. The vast majority of these A-DNA duplexes exist in two crystalline forms, in either hexagonal P61 or tetragonal P43212 space groups. Whilst some sequences such as d(GGGCGCCC) exhibit both P61 and P43212 crystal packing (Shakked, GuersteinGuzikevich, Eisenstein, Frolow & Rabinovich, 1989), all of the known P61 structures are of sequences of the type d(GGX4CC) with the four central bases comprising C, G, A, T, U and I. Structural studies of protein-DNA complexes display a wide range of DNA conformations. For the structure of a TATA box-binding protein (TBP) complexed with a 14base-pair oligonucleotide (Kim, Geiger, Hahn & Sigler, 1993; Kim, Nikolov & Burley, 1993; Kim & Burley, 1994) and the more recent structures of the transcription factor IIa with TBP and DNA (Tan, Hunziker, Sargent & Richmond, 1996; Geiger, Hahn, Lee & Sigler, 1996) the conformation of the DNA in these crystal structures has been found to be severely distorted from that of B-DNA type. In these structures the minor groove of the DNA has become wide and underwound to provide a large surface for interaction with the TBP assuming a conformation somewhat akin to features that one

observes in A-DNA. Analysis of the conformation in the TATA box (Guzikevich-Guerstein & Shakked, 1996) has shown that the conformation differs from canonical A-DNA by solely a rotation around each glycosidic bond along the DNA backbone. The structure of the TATA box containing sequence of the type d(GGX4CC), where X4 is TATA has been determined (Shakked et al., 1981) and is an A-DNA duplex, with P6~ packing within the unit cell. The close structural relationship shown for the TATA sequence in the native structure and upon protein binding highlights the importance of structural studies for sequences of this type. In this paper the structure of the octamer sequence d(GGCATGCC) is presented. This sequence is of the type d(GGX4CC) where X4 is the alternating pyrimidine-purine sequence CATG. A recent structural study from this laboratory reported the structure of the decamer d(AGGCATGCCT) (Nunn & Neidle, 1996) in which the central eight bases form an A-DNA octamer duplex.
2. Materials and methods

2.1. Crystallization and data collection The DNA octamer d(GGCATGCC) was purchased from the Oswel DNA Service (University of Southampton, Southampton, UK). Crystals were grown by vapour diffusion at both 277 and 287 K from sitting drops containing 5 gl 3 mM DNA in 30 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0), 21al 35%(v/v) NH3 solution, 21al 10mM hexamminecobalt(III) trichloride and 21al 40%(v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, equilibrated against a l ml reservoir of 40%(v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Pale brown crystals grew with hexagonal cross-section within a few days, growing to an optimal size over a period of 7-10d. A hexagonal prism grown at 287K and measuring 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.4mm was selected for data collection. Data collection was carried out using a Siemens-Xentronic multiwire area detector equipped with a rotating-anode X-ray generator (70 mA, 40 kV) and graphite monochromator. A crystal-to-detector distance of 10cm and swing angle of 15 ° was used. Data were collected with X set at 45 °, while the crystal was rotated through 100 ° in ~. 180 second frames were recorded every 0.2 ° steps. Data processing was carried out using the program XDS (Kabsch, 1993) and the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). A

CHRISTINE M. NUNN AND STEPHEN NEIDLE addition to positional refinement, atomic temperaturefactor refinement was carried out. After positional and temperature-factor refinement of all DNA atoms the R factor was 21.7%. Solvent molecules were located from difference electron-density maps and assigned as water molecules in the refinement. No hexamminecobalt(III) ions were located anywhere in the structure, and are presumably delocalized throughout the unit cell. The refinement converged after the inclusion of 65 water molecules to give a final R factor of 17.1% for data within the range 8-2.38 ,~. Mean values for the thermal parameters (j~2) are 27, 26, 26, and 34 for the phosphate groups, sugars, bases and solvent molecules, respectively. The X-PLOR refinement and Rfactor calculations used 2045 data with F > 2or(F). The root-mean-square deviations from target values for bond lengths and angles are 0.009 ]k and 1.48°, respectively. The final atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Nucleic Acid Database.*
3. Results and discussion

271

The structure is an A-DNA octamer duplex (Fig. 1) comprising two self-complementary strands of the octamer within the crystallographic asymmetric unit with Watson-Crick base pairs along the entire length of the duplex. The bases are labelled G1 to C8 in the 5' to 3' direction for the first strand and G9 to C16 for the second. The number of base pairs per tum extrapolates to 11.3, which is typical for A-DNA. The helix axis is nonlinear with a total angle of curvature of 7.1 °, bending in the central region of the helix towards the DNA minor groove. The global and local (shown in bold) helical and basepair parameters for the octamer duplex are shown in Table 1. The terminal GpG step has a small helical twist with both of these G.C base pairs exhibiting large values of propeller twist. The propeller twist for the terminal two base pairs at each end of the duplex are larger than the central four base pairs. Backbone torsion angles for the octamer are similar along the length of the duplex (Table 2) and typical of values seen for A-DNA. Sugar puckers for the nucleotides are C3'-endo for all but one guanosine (G2) and one cytosine (C16) for which the pseudorotation angles are slightly larger and the conformation is C4~-exo. Intrastrand P--P separations vary along the duplex, ranging from 5.7 to 6.3 ~ with the largest values occurring at the positions of C4'-exo sugar pucker. The stacking for each of the the dinucleotide steps for the octamer duplex is the same as that observed previously for A-DNA octamer duplexes of this type

(Lauble, Frank, Bloecker & Heinemann, 1988). The terminal stacking interactions at both ends of the duplex show no stacking interactions between the cytosine bases and very little for the guanine bases. Stepping through the duplex the base-pair stacking shows alternating poor and good overlap, with good overlaps observed for the two GpC steps and the central ApT step - the (pyrimidine)p(purine) steps and poor overlaps for the other four steps. This feature is also seen in the structure of d(AGGCATGCCT) (Nunn & Neidle, 1996). The DNA minor-groove width for d(GGCATGCC) is shown in Fig. 2 along with values for the corresponding sequence within the structure of d(AGGCATGCCT) (Nunn & Neidle, 1996). The minor-groove width increases at the centre of the duplex though not to the degree shown for d(AGGCATGCCT). The molecular packing of octamer duplexes within this P6~ cell has been observed previously for all other octameric sequences of the type d(GGX4CC). Presumably this packing arrangement requires two contiguous guanine and cytosine bases at the 5' and 3' end of the sequence, respectively. The terminal base pair of one duplex stacks against the minor groove of a neighbouring duplex within the unit cell, related by either a 6n or 2~ screw axis. There is only one intermolecular hydrogenbonding contact for d(GGCATGCC) from atom N2 of base G(2) to atom 04' of base G(9) of a symmetryrelated sugar phosphate backbone of 2.81/~. 65 solvent sites were included in the refinement. All four of the terminal hydroxyl groups 105', 803', 905' and 1603' form hydrogen-bonding interactions with water molecules. Only limited hydration was observed in the DNA minor groove with water molecules directly bound to atom N3 of A(4) and G(10) and atom 02 of

A-DNA OCTAMER d(GGCATGCC) structure there are two solvent interactions between the adjacent minor grooves of the two symmetry-related helices. One water molecule binds to atom 02 of both C(ll) and C(16) whilst there is a solvent-mediated interaction between atom 02 of C(8) and atom N3 of A(4). The crystal structures of two other A-DNA octamer sequences with sequences close to d(GGCATGCC) have been reported. These sequences, d(GGGATCCC) (Lauble et al., 1988) and d(GGTATACC) (Shakked et al., 1983) both contain two base-pair changes from the present structure (shown as bold type). The sequence d(GGCATGCC) is close to being an alternating purine-pyrimidine sequence, with just one base-pair change at either end of the duplex compared to the Z-DNA octamer d(CGCATGCG) (Fuji! et al., 1985). Another sequence which has six similar bases is d(GCATGCT) (Leonard et al., 1995). This sequence exhibits a quite different structure with a novel loop conformation which dimerizes to form a quadruplex structure. The minor groove of A-DNA is recognised by proteins. It is of interest to examine the geometry of the DNA minor groove within the three similar P61 A-DNA structures of the type d(GGX4CC) where X4 = CATG, TATA and GATC. Because of the non-linear nature of the A-DNA helical axis in these structures the program C U R V E S (Lavery & Sklenar, 1988) was used to investigate the minor-groove geometry (Stofer & Lavery, 1994). The minor-groove width and depth for the three

C(8), C(11) and C(16). In the major groove the degree of hydration is greater with 11 solvent molecules directly hydrogen bonding to the DNA bases. The hydration of the phosphate groups is typical of A-DNA (Eisenstein & Shakked, 1995) with 17 water molecules directly bound to phosphate O atoms. As a result of unit-cell packing the terminal base pairs G(1).C(16) and C(8).G(9) stack against symmetry-related duplexes. In this region of the
