Summary Dps proteins play a major role in the protection of bacterial DNA from damage by reactive oxygen species. Previous studies have implicated the extended lysine-containing N-terminal regions of Dps subunits in DNA binding, but this part of the structure has not previously been observed crystallographically. Here the structures of two Dps proteins (DpsA and DpsB) from Lactococcus lactis MG1363 reveal for the first time the presence of an N-terminal a helix that extends from the core of the Dps subunit. Consequently, the N-terminal helices are displayed in parallel pairs on the exterior of the dodecameric Dps assemblies. Both DpsA and DpsB bind DNA. Deletion of the DpsA N-terminal helix impaired DNA binding. The N-terminal Lys residues of Escherichia coli Dps have been implicated in DNA binding. Replacement of the lactococcal DpsA Lys residues 9, 15 and 16 by Glu did not inhibit DNA binding. However, DNA binding was inhibited by EDTA, suggesting a role for cations in DNA binding. In contrast to E. coli, Bacillus brevis and Mycobacterium smegmatis Dps:DNA complexes, in which DNA interacts with crystalline Dps phases, L. lactis DNA:Dps complexes appeared as noncrystalline aggregates of protein and DNA in electron micrographs.

Introduction All organisms in aerobic environments are exposed to reactive oxygen species that are generated as by-products of aerobic metabolism. Such reactive oxygen species can damage most cellular components including proteins, lipids and DNA (Storz and Imlay, 1999; Storz and Zheng, 2000). Consequently, organisms have evolved defence mechanisms to prevent and repair oxidative damage, such as the production of catalases and peroxidases (detoxification of hydrogen peroxide) and superoxide dismutases (detoxification of superoxide) (Storz and Imlay, 1999; Storz and Zheng, 2000). The hydroxyl radical is formed when hydrogen peroxide reacts with Fe(II) in the Fenton reaction and is the most damaging reactive oxygen species. Thus, iron can increase oxidative damage to cell components by promoting the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Prokaryotic Dps (DNA binding protein from starved cells) proteins play a key role in the response to oxidative stress. The Escherichia coli Dps protein was first identified as a starvation-induced 19 kDa protein in 3-day old cultures (Almiron et al., 1992). The dps mutant was shown to be sensitive to hydrogen peroxide (Almiron et al., 1992) and accordingly dps gene expression is activated by OxyR in response to peroxide stress (Zheng et al., 2001). Thus Dps is considered to be a key antioxidant activity in E. coli and other bacteria (Storz and Zheng, 2000). Furthermore, the isolated Dps protein bound to DNA by forming highly ordered two-dimensional arrays (Almiron et al., 1992). Binding of Dps to DNA decreased the number of single-stranded breaks and other peroxide-induced DNA damage in vivo and in vitro (Martinez and Kolter, 1997). Further analysis revealed that the crystalline arrays of Dps:DNA complexes form in vivo in stationary phase cells (Wolf et al., 1999). The E. coli Dps is the founder member of a major branch of the ferritin superfamily of iron-storage proteins (reviewed by Harrison and Arosio, 1996; Grant et al., 1998). Thus, the overall protein fold of Dps is similar to that of the 24-meric ferritins, but the quarternary structure differs. Whereas, the 24-meric ferritins are composed of 24 identical or similar subunits arranged as a ball-like protein shell enclosing a cavity in which iron can be stored (reviewed by Harrison and Arosio, 1996) the Dps branch of the family

Thus, there are examples of Dps proteins that both bind DNA and sequester iron to protect DNA from damage by acting as a physical shield and by inhibiting Fenton chemistry (Almiron et al., 1992; Chen and Helmann, 1995; Martinez and Kolter, 1997; Ren et al., 2003; Gupta and Chatterji, 2003). It has been suggested that DNA binding by E. coli Dps involves interactions with the N-terminal lysine-rich tails of the Dps subunits, but unfortunately this part of the structure was not observable in the electron density maps due to disorder (Grant et al., 1998). More recently, a role for Mg(II) cations acting as bridges between the protein and DNA has been proposed (Frenkiel-Krispin et al., 2001). Other Dps-like proteins do not bind DNA but offer protection from oxidative damage by sequestering iron and thereby inhibiting the formation of reactive oxygen species (Bozzi et al., 1997; Steffani et al., 1999; Ilari et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2002; Yamamoto et al., 2002; Ceci et al., 2003; Ishikawa et al., 2003; Pulliainen et al., 2003). Furthermore, the HP-NAP protein of Helicobacter pylori activates neutrophils, acts as a protective antigen and is a major virulence factor (Tonello et al., 1999; Satin et al., 2000; Zanotti et al., 2002). Thus, Dps proteins are important components of the bacterial stress response. The lactic acid bacterium Lactococcus lactis MG1363 possesses two paralogous three gene operons (orfX-orfYflp) designated the flpA and flpB operons (Gostick et al., 1999). The flpAB double mutant is sensitive to hydrogen peroxide suggesting that these operons are important in the oxidative stress response (Gostick et al., 1999; Scott et al., 2000a). The last genes of the operons encode transcription factors (Flps; FNR-like proteins) that respond to oxidative stress (Gostick et al., 1998; Scott et al., 2000b; Green et al., 2001). The orfY genes are predicted to encode proteins similar to the Dps protein of E. coli (Almiron et al., 1992) and the MrgA (metalloregulation) protein of Bacillus subtilis (Chen and Helmann, 1995; Gostick et al., 1999). The orfX genes are predicted to encode proteins similar to the MerP-type metallochaperones (Gostick et al., 1999). Here biochemical and structural evidence is presented to indicate that the orfY genes encode Dps proteins. Ilari et al., 2000). Further sequence analysis using the PsiPred threading method (Jones, 1999) strongly supported this conclusion (Fig. 1). Members of the Dps family have 12 identical subunits arranged as a shell that encloses a central cavity. Each subunit consists of a fourhelix bundle similar to that of ferritin (reviewed by Harrison and Arosio, 1996). Compared with the non-DNA-binding L. innocua ferritin-like protein, the Lactococcal Dps and the E. coli Dps proteins have extended N-terminal regions (Fig. 1) and it has been suggested that the N-terminal region of E. coli Dps participates in DNA binding (Grant et al., 1998). Thus, it was suggested that the L. lactis OrfY proteins might function as Dps proteins (protecting DNA from oxidative damage by forming DNA:protein complexes), and/or as iron-storage proteins. If this were true then it could, at least in part, account for the peroxide sensitivity of the flpAB double mutant. To assign functions to the putative L. lactis Dps proteins both were overproduced in E. coli and isolated. The N-terminal amino acid sequences and mass spectrometry (measured masses: DpsA 20 912.3 Da; DpsB 20 905.7 Da) confirmed the identities of the purified proteins. On gel filtration columns both proteins eluted as high molecular weight oligomers (Mr ~250 000) (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels DpsB migrated as a distinct species with a molecular weight of ~250 000 (Fig. 2B). In contrast DpsA migrated as a smear containing up to three species, two of which (Mr ~70 000 and ~50 000) suggested the presence of trimeric and dimeric forms of the protein (Fig. 2B). This may be significant because a recent report suggested that a trimeric form of the M. smegmatis Dps protein does not bind DNA but has ferroxidase activity, whereas the dodecamer has DNA binding activity (Gupta and Chatterji, 2003). However, as prepared neither lactococcal Dps protein was associated with substantial quantities of metal ions that might indicate a role in metal-ion storage, with only small amounts of Zn (0.1­0.6 atoms per subunit) and Fe (0.045­0.060 atoms per subunit) being detected. The structures of the L. lactis DpsA and DpsB were both solved and refined to a resolution of 2.9 Å and 2.7 Å respectively (Table 1; Fig. 3). Both DpsA and DpsB form dodecamers with dimensions similar to those of E. coli Dps, being ~90 Å in diameter with a hollow core of ~45 Å diameter. The structures of DpsA and DpsB are very similar and superpose with an RMSD of 0.64 Å on 168 Cá atoms for the monomer and 1.12 Å on 2016 Cá atoms for the dodecamer (Fig. 3C). The structures include all amino acids except for two and five residues at the N-terminus and the final eight and 10 mainly acidic C-terminal amino acids of DpsA and DpsB, respectively, which were disordered (Fig. 1). However, it is clear from the location of the last visible residues that these C-terminal acidic regions

Results Solution of the structures of DpsA and DpsB Using a sequence profile derived from both L. lactis OrfY proteins a remote relationship (< 22% identity) was detected with the Dps of E. coli (Almiron et al., 1992), MrgA of B. subtilis (Chen and Helmann, 1995) and the ferritin-like protein of Listeria innocua (Bozzi et al., 1997;

Escherichia coli Dps (Dps_Ec) is a DNA-binding and iron-sequestering protein from a Gram-negative bacterium, L. innocua ferritin-like protein (LstFtn) is a non-DNA-binding 12-meric ferritin, B. subtilis MrgA (MrgA_bs) is a DNA-binding and ironsequestering protein from a Gram-positive bacterium and E. coli ferritin A (FtnA_Ec) is a prokaryotic non-DNA-binding 24-meric ferritin. Residues that are identical in DpsA and DpsB are shown as white on a dark blue background. Other identities are shown as black on a cyan background. Helical regions are indicated by cylinders below the amino acid sequences. Blue triangles indicate the positions of the N-terminal Lys residues, brown triangles the amino acid residues that comprise the Dps, L. innocua ferritin and MrgA ferroxidase centres, and brown circles the amino acids of the FtnA ferroxidase centre. One of the amino acids of the FtnA ferroxidase site is conserved (filled brown circle above the alignment), and a second nearby residue is also conserved (open brown circle above the alignment).

must be located on the exterior of the protein shell and not within the cavity of either protein. Because the DpsA and DpsB structures are very similar, they are considered together in the following discussion, unless otherwise stated. The lactococcal Dps subunits have a core four-helix bundle in which two pairs of helices (A and B; C and D) are connected by a long (29 amino acid) loop that is interrupted by a short helix (BC helix) (Fig. 3A). The short BC helix interacts with a symmetry related partner across the twofold axis (Fig. 3B). This core subunit structure is very similar to those of E. coli Dps and L. innocua ferritin (Fig. 3C). Superposition of DpsB with the E. coli Dps and L. innocua ferritin reveals that the core structures are essentially identical (RMSD = 1.16 Å and 1.12 Å on 92 and 107 Ca atoms respectively). This similarity extends to the dodecameric structures that superpose with RMS values of 1.77 Å and 1.38 Å on 1104 and 1284 Ca atoms respectively. The 24-meric ferritins lack the BC helix, but the DpsB A, B, C and D helices superpose on the four-helix

core of a single E. coli ferritin subunit with an RMS of 1.33 Å on 81 Ca atoms (Fig. 3C). The structure of the first 13 amino acids that constitute the region of E. coli Dps proposed to be involved in DNA binding has not been determined because they are disordered (Grant et al., 1998). It is now revealed that the corresponding N-terminal amino acids of lactococcal DpsA and DpsB form a helix (aN) that extends perpendicularly from the core and folds across an adjacent twofold related subunit (Fig. 3B and D) in all subunits of both proteins. The N-terminal helices interact with the core four-helix bundle of the adjacent subunit via salt bridges and hydrogen bonds involving amino acid residues Asp8 and Lys105, and Glu14 and Tyr108 in both DpsA and DpsB (Fig. 3B). This arrangement suggests that the DpsA dissociation product is likely to be a dimer (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, aN is exposed on the surface of the dodecamer and is available to interact with DNA (Fig. 3D). This arrangement contrasts with the almost spherical appearance of the nonDNA-binding L. innocua ferritin dodecamer (Fig. 3E).

Fig. 2. Oligomeric state of DpsA and DpsB. A. Determination of molecular weight by size exclusion chromatography of DpsA and DpsB. The molecular weight standards were: cytochrome c (12.3 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), apoferritin (440 kDa). The void volume was determined using Blue dextran. The elution volumes of DpsA (13.9 ml) and DpsB (14.0 ml) (dashed line) were similar to that of catalase (14.0 ml) indicating a molecular weight of ~250 000. B. Determination of molecular weight by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of DpsA and DpsB under non-denaturing conditions. The Rf values of DpsA, DpsB and the molecular weight marker proteins (a-lactalbumin, 14.2 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa, 132 kDa and 198 kDa; urease, 272 kDa and 545 kDa) were determined after electrophoresis on different percentage polyacrylamide gels. The molecular weights of the standard proteins are plotted against the negative slopes (-Slope) from plots of 100[logRf ¥ 100] against gel concentration. This suggested that DpsA had a molecular weight of ~50­70 kDa and DpsB a molecular weight of ~250 kDa.

The internal surfaces of both DpsA and DpsB dodecamers are highly negatively charged, and thus the cavities are compatible with the sequestration of cations. The threefold interfaces of both L. lactis Dps proteins contain a much wider channels (~8 Å diameter) than those of either E. coli Dps, or L. innocua ferritin. This should permit unhindered access for small molecules to the interior of the DpsA and DpsB shells. As in E. coli Dps, or L. innocua ferritin, these hydrophilic pores are lined with negatively charged residues (Fig. 4A­C). Lactococcus lactis Dps proteins lack conventional ferroxidase centres The 12-meric ferritins possess ferroxidase centres at the interface between pairs of subunits. The intersubunit ferroxidase centre of E. coli Dps consists of Asp78 and Glu82 of one subunit and His51, His63 and Asp67 of another (Fig. 1). However, in DpsA only the corresponding glutamic acid residue is conserved, and in DpsB none of the ferroxidase centre residues are present (Fig. 1). Moreover, analysis of the DpsA and DpsB proteins for three-dimensional patterns of amino acid sidechains resembling those of ferroxidase centres using the ASSAM program (Artymiuk et al., 1994) failed to detect any matches to either inter or intrasubunit ferroxidase centres. Thus, neither protein possesses the amino acid residues required for the assembly of an intersubunit ferroxidase centre. This is in striking contrast not only to the

12-meric ferritins but also to the Dps proteins of E. coli, H. pylori, Bacillus brevis, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Streptococcus suis and Bacillus anthracis (Grant et al., 1998; Ilari et al., 2002; Papinuto et al., 2002; Zanotti et al., 2002; Ren et al., 2003; Ceci et al., 2003; Kauko et al., 2004). Analysis of the DpsA and DpsB proteins as isolated indicated the presence of substoichiometric amounts of Zn and Fe (see above). Soaking crystals with Zn(II), or Fe(II) [and with Mn(II) for DpsA], revealed the presence of an intrasubunit metal-ion binding site located at the base of aN, in which the metal ions are ligated by the ND1 of His22 and NE2 of His33 and two water molecules (Fig. 3B). These two His residues are located at the end of aN (His22) and the start of aA (His33). However, the position, or degree of order of aN was not altered by the presence or absence of bound metal. The lactococcal Dps proteins bind and protect DNA from oxidative damage The structural and biophysical properties described above suggested that the lactococcal Dps proteins, like E. coli Dps, might bind to DNA to protect it from oxidative damage. Initial gel retardation analyses using DNA fragments ranging in size from ~300 bp to ~3000 bp suggested that neither DpsA nor DpsB were capable of binding DNA (not shown). However, when a larger (~8000 bp) fragment was used both DpsA and DpsB bound DNA. The E. coli ferritin,

FtnA, did not interact with DNA under the conditions tested, indicating that the observed interactions were specific to the Dps proteins (Fig. 5A). Addition of a fivefold molar excess of unlabelled DNA to preformed Dps:DNA complexes was sufficient to relieve retardation of the labelled fragment by DpsB but not DpsA (not shown). This suggests that the DpsA:DNA complexes are more stable than those formed by DpsB. Further analysis showed that DpsA had a higher affinity (KDapp ~0.3 mM) for DNA than DpsB (KDapp ~4 mM) (Fig. 5B). For comparison, the corresponding value for the E. coli Dps protein is ~0.2 mM (Azam and Ishihama, 1999). In the presence of EDTA binding of DpsA to DNA was inhibited, suggesting that cations are required for the formation of electrophoretically stable DpsA:DNA complexes (Fig. 5C). However, unlike E. coli Dps increasing concentrations of Mg(II) did not appear to inhibit binding of DpsA to DNA (Fig. 5D, upper panel). Furthermore, binding to a smaller DNA fragment (~4 kbp) was not promoted at any of the Mg(II) concentrations tested (Fig. 5D, lower panel). It has been proposed that three Lys residues located close to the N-terminal of the E. coli Dps protein contribute

Lactococcus lactis Dps proteins 1107 residues respectively (Fig. 1). These residues either face (Lys9 and Lys16 of DpsA; Lys10 and Lys17 of DpsB), or lie parallel (Lys15 of DpsA; Lys4 and Lys13 of DpsB) to the dodecamer surface (Fig. 3B). Thus, for these Nterminal Lys residues to interact directly with the negatively charged DNA backbone aN would have to be repositioned upon DNA binding. The role of aN was investigated further using DpsA because of its higher affinity for DNA. A DpsA variant (DpsADaN) lacking amino acids 1­20 of the N-terminal helix (aN) and with His21 and His22 replaced by Met and Asp, respectively, was impaired in the ability to interact with DNA in bandshift assays (Fig. 5A, lanes 7 and 8). The DpsADaN protein eluted from gel filtration columns at a similar point to the native DpsA, suggesting that the removal of the N-terminal region had not prevented the assembly of DpsADaN dodecamers (not shown). Thus, it is evident that the N-terminal region of DpsA is important for DNA binding. Therefore, site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace Lys residues 9, 15 and 16 by Glu residues to create the variant DpsA-Kmut. These replacements did not abolish DNA binding by DpsA (Fig. 5A, lane 9). Moreover, the KDapp for DNA binding of the DpsA-Kmut protein was slightly lower (~0.2 mM) than that of the unaltered DpsA protein (Fig. 5B). Thus, it was concluded that although the N-terminal region is required for DNA binding, the positively charged Lys residues within this region are not essential for mediating interactions between DpsA and DNA. The role of Dps in protecting DNA from oxidative damage was assessed by measuring the formation of singlestranded breaks in plasmid DNA. Hence, hydroxyl radicals were generated by the addition of ferric-EDTA and hydrogen peroxide (Gutteridge et al., 1990; Martinez and Kolter, 1997) to plasmid DNA in the presence and absence of DpsA or DpsB. In agreement with the ability to bind DNA with relatively high affinity, DpsA afforded protection against oxidative damage to DNA, at lower concentrations than DpsB (Fig. 6). The higher concentrations of DpsB required to afford protection also altered the electrophoretic mobility of the DNA suggesting that DpsB remains bound to the DNA during electrophoresis (Fig. 6A). Although amino acid sequence analysis indicates that the lactococcal Dps proteins lack a conventional ferroxidase centre the possibility that these proteins could protect DNA from oxidative damage by sequestering iron and detoxifying hydrogen peroxide cannot be excluded. Thus, to investigate the contribution of DNA binding to the protection of DNA from Fe-independent damage, the effect of DpsA on dimethylsulphate-mediated DNA methylation was determined. The data obtained showed that in the presence of DpsA DNA methylation was inhibited (Fig. 6B). Therefore, it was concluded that DNA binding is an important component of the ability of DpsA to protect

Fig. 6. The Dps proteins protect DNA from damage in vitro. A. Oxidative damage to supercoiled plasmid DNA generates nicked and linear forms that have lower mobility in agarose gels. Where indicated, FeCl3 (0.1 mM), EDTA (0.5 mM), H2O2 (10 mM) were added to either plasmid DNA (lanes 2 and 3), or preformed DpsA (lanes 4­6; 1.5, 7 and 14 mM, respectively) or DpsB (lanes 8­10; 1.5, 7 and 40 mM, respectively) DNA complexes. Control reactions with heatinactivated DpsA (14 mM; lane 7) and heat-inactivated DpsB (40 mM; lane 11) were also prepared. After incubation at 25C for 1 h the reactions were stopped by the addition of bipyridyl (5 mM), which inhibits the reaction by chelating the active species Fe(II). Supercoiled DNA (S) nicked DNA (N), and linear DNA (L) and Dps:DNA complexes (C) were then separated by electrophoresis on TAE-buffered 1.0% agarose gels. The relative concentrations of Dps protein in the reactions are indicated by the height of the solid shapes above the gel. B. Exposure of DNA to dimethylsulphate (DMS) generates methylated bases that are cleaved in the presence of piperidine. Where indicated DMS was added to reactions containing radiolabelled DNA in the presence and absence of DpsA (10 mM). After cleaving methylated bases the reactions were resolved on 6% DNA denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The presence of protected (unmethylated/uncleaved) DNA is indicated (P).

Observation of Dps:DNA complexes by electron microscopy In negatively stained electron micrographs the DpsB protein appeared as discrete ring-like structures in projection (Fig. 7A), with dimensions consistent with the X-ray structure described above.

discrete DpsB molecules were replaced by aggregates of DpsB:DNA complexes, with some DNA still visible (Fig. 7C). At higher DpsB to DNA ratios the DNA was no longer visible, presumably being contained within the extensive DpsB aggregates (Fig. 7D). Similar results were obtained in the presence of 10 mM Mg(II) and with DpsA (not shown). These observations contrast to those made with E. coli (Wolf et al., 1999; Frenkiel-Krispin et al., 2004) and Mycobacterium smegmatis Dps proteins (Gupta and Chatterji, 2003) in which electron micrographs of the protein:DNA complexes appear as highly ordered twodimensional crystalline arrays. Discussion The work described here shows that the OrfYA and OrfYB proteins of L. lactis MG1363 are Dps-like DNA binding proteins now designated DpsA and DpsB. The threedimensional structures of the two proteins are very similar, having a typical Dps core fold (Grant et al., 1998). However, in contrast to E. coli Dps, which has an unstructured N-terminal region, the lactococcal proteins have an Nterminal helix, aN. Investigation of the properties of the proteins showed that DpsA and DpsB bind to DNA to protect it from damage. However, DNA binding was only observed with long stretches of linearized DNA (> 4 kbp). The reasons for this are unclear as this does not appear to be a characteristic shared by other members of the Dps family. It is possible that linearized DNA is suboptimal for binding lactococcal Dps proteins, or that the N-terminal helices impose a requirement for long fragments of DNA, or that only complexes formed with the longer stretches of DNA are stable during electrophoresis, but further work will be needed to investigate these possibilities. Based on the three-dimensional structures of Dps proteins and the observation that Dps:DNA complexes form hexagonally packed two-dimensional arrays, which respond to the concentration of metal ions (Frenkiel-

Krispin et al., 2001), models for Dps DNA binding have been proposed (Grant et al., 1998; Wolf et al., 1999; Ren et al., 2003; Frenkiel-Krispin et al., 2004). For E. coli it has been suggested that upon entry into stationary phase the combination of the intrinsic properties of DNA and enhanced synthesis of Dps drives the formation of toroidal DNA structures that act as templates for the formation of Dps:DNA crystalline arrays (Frenkiel-Krispin et al., 2004). Two models have been proposed to account for the observation that the surface of the Dps dodecamer is dominated by negative charge that would repel the negatively charged sugar phosphate backbone of DNA. The first suggestion was that the DNA is threaded through channels at the interfaces between three neighbouring dodecamers and the disordered lysine-rich N-terminal region of E. coli Dps extends into the channels to mediate DNA binding (Grant et al., 1998). More recently, it has been suggested that the DNA is located between the layers of the hexagonally packed Dps dodecamers with DNA binding mediated by metal-ion bridges between the DNA and the Dps protein (Frenkiel-Krispin et al., 2001; Ren et al., 2003). The inhibition of DNA binding by lactococcal DpsA in the presence of EDTA supports the suggestion that metal-ion bridges mediate DNA binding. In both models the N-terminal region of Dps is a crucial component of the DNA binding mechanism. The recent characterization of the non-DNA binding A. tumefaciens Dps protein further supports the involvement of the Nterminal region in DNA binding. This latter protein has a short N-terminal tail that is ordered and interacts with the C-terminus and aC of the threefold symmetry-related subunit (Ceci et al., 2003). It was proposed that the shorter N-terminal region and its interaction with the main body of the protein could account for the inability of the A. tumefaciens Dps protein to bind DNA. The presence of a metal-ion binding site in the lactococcal Dps proteins associated with two His residues located in the loop connecting aN to the rest of the molecule raised the possibility

Lactococcus lactis Dps proteins 1109 that this site might act as a switch to modulate the ability of aN to interact with DNA, perhaps by exposing the Nterminal Lys side-chains (Fig. 3B). However, Zn(II) binding at this site did not significantly alter the conformation of aN and the retention of DNA binding activity by the lactococcal DpsA variant lacking the N-terminal Lys residues suggests that direct interaction between Lys side-chains and the DNA backbone is unlikely. Nevertheless, the observation that deletion of aN abolished DNA binding by DpsA indicates that, like E. coli Dps, DpsA:DNA interactions are mediated, at least in part, via the extended Nterminal region. Thus, E. coli Dps lacking 18 N-terminal amino acids fails to condense supercoiled DNA and this suggested that the protonation state of N-terminal Lys residues determines the ability of Dps to interact with DNA and self-aggregate (Ceci et al., 2004). Further work is required to determine the precise role of the N-terminal Lys residues in DpsA and DpsB, but the observation that replacement of these residues by Glu apparently enhances DNA binding suggests that charge of the Lys side-chains is an important determinant of Dps:DNA interactions. The difference in DNA binding affinities of DpsA and DpsB, despite their very similar N-terminal regions (Fig. 1), suggests that the interactions between the proteins and DNA extend beyond the N-terminal helices. The proposal that the surface exposed, Lys-rich, C-terminal region of M. smegmatis Dps lines channels criss-crossing the Dps crystals that could accommodate DNA indicates that regions outside the N-terminal can be important for DNA binding by this family of proteins (Roy et al., 2004). Comparison of the DpsA and DpsB structures revealed 33 side-chain substitutions that are exposed on the surface of each dodecamer subunit (this figure does not include residues in the extreme N-terminus and the mainly acidic C-terminal regions of the proteins, which are not visible in the structures). An extensive programme of sitedirected mutagenesis will be needed to determine whether these differences contribute to the observed variations in the DNA-binding properties of the proteins. The present work reveals that the N-terminal regions of both L. lactis Dps proteins adopt helical conformations (aN) that extend from the subunit cores and fold across an adjacent twofold related subunits. It is possible that other Dps proteins with extended N-terminal regions might also possess an N-terminal helix (aN). If so, the existence of aN has implications for the crystalline array DNA binding models (Grant et al., 1998; Ren et al., 2003; Frenkiel-Krispin et al., 2004) because when the lactococcal Dps proteins are superposed on either of the previously suggested models unacceptable steric clashes between aN and DNA are found. Although the possibility that aN might move to accommodate the DNA cannot be excluded, it might be that the ordered helical conformation

of the N-terminal region of the lactococcal Dps proteins could account for the absence of crystalline arrays in the electron micrographs of L. lactis Dps:DNA complexes. Thus, the disordered N-terminal region of E. coli and M. smegmatis Dps proteins might be required for the formation of crystalline protein:DNA complexes. The internal cavities of the Dps proteins are strongly negatively charged and are thus compatible with a role in cation entrapment. The L. lactis Dps pores leading to the central cavities are relatively large (~8 Å diameter) and could easily accommodate metal cations. However, they are not as negatively charged as the corresponding pores of either E. coli Dps or L. innocua ferritin (Fig. 4). Only Glu139 and Glu140 are present in this region of DpsA and DpsB compared with four Asp residues in E. coli Dps and L. innocua ferritin (closed red triangles in Fig. 1). It has also been suggested that positively charged residues close to the threefold pores might assist the capture of cations by creating an electrostatic landscape that directs cations toward the negatively charged entrance to the channel (Chasteen and Harrison, 1999; Carrondo, 2003). The Dps threefold pores have positively charged residues (open red triangles in Fig. 1) nearby and so a similar mechanism may operate, but overall the L. lactis Dps pores are not as well suited for facilitating Fe(II) entry into the internal cavity as those of E. coli Dps and L. innocua ferritin. This conclusion was supported by the inability of the lactococcal Dps proteins to incorporate iron cores under aerobic conditions that allowed core formation in the E. coli FtnA protein (not shown). It is perhaps noteworthy that the first genes in the flp operons orfXA/B are predicted to encode proteins with similarity to MerP-type metallochaperones, which could therefore have a role in shuttling metal ions to DpsA and DpsB. In conclusion, it has been shown that the L. lactis orfYA and orfYB genes encode Dps proteins that protect DNA from oxidative damage, a function that is consistent with the regulatory proteins associated with the orfXA-orfYAflpA and orfXB-orfYB-flpB operons, and with the phenotype of the corresponding double mutant (Gostick et al., 1999). Moreover, the structures of the L. lactis Dps proteins reveal for the first time the presence of an N-terminal helix (aN) that is involved in DNA binding.

Experimental procedures Protein purification and characterization
The DNA sequences encoding DpsA and DpsB were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (DpsA: forward primer, CAAGGAGGGAACCATGGTTGAATTAAG; reverse primer, GGACTCAAGTCGACAAAAAGTGGAC; DpsB: forward primer, GAATAAAGGAAAACCATGGTAAC; reverse primer, CAACTAAAGTCGACAGTTTCG). The products contained engineered NcoI and SalI restriction sites (underlined

above) to facilitate ligation into pET28a, and IPTG-inducible expression in E. coli BL21lDE3. The amplified genes encoded the native proteins, except for the substitution of Ile2 by Val as a consequence of the introduction of an NcoI site. The DpsA protein was isolated by chromatography on DEAESepharose, followed by ammonium sulphate precipitation and gel filtration on Superdex-200. The DpsB protein was isolated by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, Phenyl Toyopearl 650S and Superdex-200. Samples were concentrated using the Vivaspin system (Sartorius). The authenticity of the final products was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Native molecular weights were estimated on a calibrated Superdex-200 column (300 ¥ 10 mm) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 0.2 M NaCl. Oligomeric state was also determined by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The Rf values for standard proteins and DpsA/B were determined on 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% and 9% gels. These data were used to calculate the relative molecular weight of DpsA and DpsB. The ability to bind DNA was assessed by bandshift assays. The target DNA was a radiolabelled 8 kb linearized (XbaI) lactococcal shuttle vector pFI2171. Protein:DNA complexes formed during incubation for 20 min in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3 containing 50 mM KCl and 1.5 mM MgCl2 at 25C were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels buffered with Trisborate buffer (90 mM Tris, 90 mM boric acid, pH 8.3). Similar experiments in MgCl2 was omitted and EDTA (25 mM) was added to incubations were used to assess the effects of cation sequestration on DNA binding. The amount of DNA retarded (%) was estimated by quantitative densitometry of autoradiographs using Imagemaster software (Amersham). In vitro DNA protection from hydroxyl radicals was determined as described by Martinez and Kolter (1997), except pGEM3Zf(+) plasmid and lactococcal Dps proteins were used. In vitro DNA methylation protection was achieved by allowing DpsA:DNA complexes to form as described above in the presence of BSA (1 mg ml-1) with a final concentration of 10 mM DpsA in a total volume of 10 ml. The reactions were treated with 0.2% (v/v) dimethylsulphate for 3 min. DNA methylation was halted by the addition of 5 ml of 1.5 M sodium acetate, pH 7.0 containing 1 M b-mercaptoethanol, 15 mM EDTA and 0.1 mg ml-1 sheared calf thymus DNA. After collecting the radiolabelled DNA by ethanol precipitation methylated bases were cleaved by incubation with 10% (v/v) piperidine and 10 mM EDTA at 90C for 30 min. The reactions were then dried, washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in denaturing gel loading buffer: 33% (v/v) 0.1 M NaOH; 66% (v/v) formamide; 0.1% (w/v) xylene cyanol; 0.1% (w/v) bromophenol blue. The DNA fragments were separated on 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide sequencing gels with reactions that were not treated with dimethylsulphate and/or lacked DpsA as controls. Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved using appropriate oligonucleotides with the QuikChange system (Stratagene). The metal-ion content of the proteins was determined by ICP-MS. For observation of DpsB:DNA complexes by electron microscopy, equal volumes (5 ml) of protein and linearized plasmid DNA (see above) solutions in either binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg ml-1 BSA) or 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, containing 10 mM MgCl2 were combined and incubated for 20 min at 25C. The final concentrations were 12.5 mg ml-1 DpsB, 125 mg ml-1 DNA for the low protein:DNA ratio of 1:10, and 125 mg ml-1 DpsB, 125 mg ml-1 DNA for the 1:1 ratio. Two microlitres of each mixture were loaded and incubated for further 1 min on a 15 s glow discharged carbon-coated copper grids. The grids were negatively stained with 0.75% (w/v) uranyl formate. Free protein and free DNA controls were prepared as above, with final concentrations specified in Fig. 7. Electron micrographs were recorded at a nominal magnification of 39 000¥ on a Philips CM 100 electron microscope operating at 100 kV, using Gatan MultiScan 794 CCD camera.

Crystallization, data collection and processing
Crystals of DpsA were grown by hanging drop vapour diffusion at 17C from 1.7 M ammonium sulphate, 0.1 M HEPES/Na pH 7.5 using a protein concentration of 40 mg ml-1. The crystals belonged to space group R32 with cell dimensions a = b = 132 Å and c = 326 Å. Crystals of DpsB were grown by hanging drop vapour diffusion at 17C from 2.0 M sodium formate, 0.1 M sodium acetate trihydrate pH 4.6 using a protein concentration of ~10 mg ml-1. The crystals belonged to space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 128 Å, b = 128 Å and c = 194 Å. Details of the data collection are given in Table 1. Data were processed using MOSFLM (Leslie, 1994), and the CCP4 program suite (Bailey, 1994).

MR phasing, model building and refinement
The dodecameric Listeria ferritin (PDB code: 1qgh; Ilari et al., 2000) was used as the search model to solve the structure of DpsB by molecular replacement (MR). Solvent flattening and 12-fold NCS averaging (Cowtan, 1994) significantly improved the MR phases. Alternating cycles of model building (Roussel and Cambillau, 1991) and refinement (Tronrud, 1997) were then performed. The structure of DpsA was solved by MR using the refined dodecameric model of DpsB. Initial phases were again improved by solvent flattening and fourfold NCS averaging and alternating cycles of model building and refinement performed. Details of both final models are given in Table 1.
