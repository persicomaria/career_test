ABSTRACT: A detailed description of hemoglobin cooperativity requires knowledge of the dimer-dimer interactions responsible for the low ligand affinity of the quaternary-T tetramer, the "quaternary-T constraints", along with stereochemical pathways that specify how ligand binding disrupts these quaternary constraints. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. [Noble, R. W., et al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 12357-12368] has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues at the R1 2 interface that is centered at Trp37 . In this paper, crystallographic studies are presented for most of the mutant hemoglobins studied by Noble et al. These crystallographic experiments identify structural transitionssreferred to as T-to-THigh transitionssbetween the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures that are induced by some mutations in the Trp37 cluster and/or by exposing crystals of wild-type or mutant deoxyhemoglobins to oxygen. The T-to-THigh quaternary transitions consist of a rotation of the R1 1 dimer relative to the R2 2 dimer as well as a coupled R dimer bending component that consists of a small rotation of the R1 subunit relative to the 1 subunit (and a symmetry related rotation of the R2 subunit relative to the 2 subunit). In addition, differences in subunit tertiary structure associated with the T-to-THigh transitions suggest two stereochemical pathways (one associated with the R subunits and one associated with the subunits) by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37 cluster. In the R subunits, ligand binding induces a shift of the heme iron producing tension in a chain of covalent bonds that extends from the Fe-N 2His(F8)R1 bond to the peptide backbone bonds of residues His87(F8)R1 and Ala88(F9)R1. This tension induces an R-to- transition in the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix that shifts the -carbon of Ala88R1 by 1.5 Å directly into the side chain of Tyr140R1 (a key residue in the Trp37 2 cluster). Collectively these structural changes constitute a relatively short pathway by which ligand binding forces Tyr140R1 into the R1 2 interface disrupting quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37 2 cluster. In the subunits, our analysis suggests a more extended energy transduction pathway in which ligand-induced 1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the 1 subunit that promote R1 1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37 2 cluster at the R1 2 interface.

It has long been realized that hemoglobin and all other allosteric proteins that exhibit positive cooperativity have the following general properties: (1) they are oligomeric assemblies with multiple ligand (substrate) binding sites, (2) the unliganded oligomeric protein has a ligand affinity that is much lower than that of the isolated subunits, and (3) large changes in quaternary structure and smaller changes in tertiary structure occur in response to ligand binding (1). Thus the initial low affinity of the oligomeric protein must be the result of subunit-subunit interactions (i.e., quaternary structure constraints) that oppose the binding of ligand. As ligand binds to the protein, its tertiary and quaternary structures change, quaternary constraints relax, and at least some of the remaining unliganded binding sites (active sites) exhibit

increased ligand affinity. Positive cooperativity, therefore, is achieved by linking small ligand-induced changes in local tertiary structure to larger changes in quaternary structure. In the case of hemoglobin, the oxygen affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin R2 2 tetramer is nearly 400-fold lower than the oxygen affinity of free deoxy R dimers (2, 3), indicating that quaternary constraints unique to the deoxy tetramer's dimer-dimer interface oppose ligation-induced structural transitions. Identifying these quaternary constraints and determining how they are stereochemically linked to ligand binding is central to a full understanding of the cooperative mechanism of hemoglobin action. Early studies by Antonini et al. (4) and Kilmartin et al. (5, 6) on carboxypeptidase A and carboxypeptidase B digested human hemoglobin showed that loss of the COOH-terminal residues of the R subunits (desArg141R hemoglobin), and to a lesser extent the COOHterminal residues of the subunits (desHis146 hemoglobin), increased the overall ligand affinity of hemoglobin (i.e., the oxygen pressure required for half saturation, the p50, decreased). Since the initial crystal structures of liganded

FIGURE 1: Stereoimage of the hinge region of the R1 2 interface in the wild-type quaternary-T deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. The side chains of the amino acid residues are color-coded according to the ratio of the mutant to wild-type CO-combination rate constants as reported by Noble el al. (14) as follows; red >5, orange 2.6-5, green 1.6-2.5, and light blue 0.7-1.5. The mutationally sensitive sites in this region (the red, orange, and green residues) represent the major source of quaternary constraint in the quaternary-T deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Collectively, this group of residues is referred to as the "Trp37 cluster". Mutations at residue Trp37 have the largest impact on the ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer. Trp37 is located at the center of the cluster and makes contacts of 3.7 Å or less with each of the other members of the cluster.

and deoxyhemoglobin revealed that both the R and COOHterminal residues contribute to interdimer salt bridges in deoxyhemoglobin, but not in liganded hemoglobin, Perutz proposed a stereochemical mechanism for hemoglobin allostery in which these salt bridges are the major source of quaternary constraint (7, 8). Subsequently, the degree to which the COOH-terminal residues of the R and subunits contribute to the quaternary-T constraints that reduce the ligand affinity of the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer was determined by measurements of the first Adair constant, K1, for desArg141R hemoglobin and desHis146 hemoglobin in solution and in quaternary-T hemoglobin crystals (9-12). These studies showed that the constraints associated with the salt bridges formed by Arg141R are significant while those associated with His146 are much smaller. In addition, resonance Raman studies of Wang and Spiro (13) have revealed that strain in the Fe-N 2His(F8) bonds is decreased in desArg141R deoxyhemoglobin and less so in desHis146 deoxyhemoglobin, demonstrating a direct connection between the COOH-terminal salt bridges and the heme groups. Since the COOH-terminal salt bridges are not the only dimer-dimer interactions that are present in the deoxyhemoglobin tetramer and absent in the fully liganded hemoglobin tetramer, other ligation-dependent dimer-dimer contacts could also serve as quaternary constraints. In an effort to determine the relative importance of all the dimer-dimer interactions, Noble et al. (14) carried out a mutagenic screen (mainly an alanine screen) in which the interdimer contacts associated with individual residues were systematically eliminated. In particular, Noble et al. measured the secondorder CO combination rate constants for 41 hemoglobin variants with mutations at 29 different residues. [The CO combination rate constant measured in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate has been shown to be an excellent proxy for K1, the first Adair constant (a parameter that is very difficult to determine, especially for variant hemoglobins

with high ligand affinity). Specifically, the CO combination rate constant correlates very well with the oxygen affinity (p50 values) of crystalline hemoglobin constrained by lattice contacts to the quaternary-T conformation (15) as well as with the K1 value measured in solution for symmetric Fe/ Zn hybrid hemoglobins that have only two oxygen binding sites (12, 16). Thus the CO combination rate constant is a good measure of the level of quaternary constraint present in a deoxyhemoglobin tetramer.] While the majority of dimer-dimer interface mutations had little or no impact on the CO combination rate, mutations at a small number of residues (that included Arg141R, but not His146 ) had a substantial impact on the CO combination rate. Moreover, these residues (i.e., the residues that contribute in a significant way to the quaternary constraints) are not distributed uniformly over the dimer-dimer interface; they are localized almost exclusively to the so-called "hinge region" of the R1 2 interface [see Figure 1 of Noble et al. (14)]. More specifically, these residues form a cluster centered at Trp37 (Figure 1), the residue that is most sensitive to mutation, and for this reason we refer to this critical group of residues as the "Trp37 cluster". Consistent with this finding are the proton exchange studies of Mihailescu et al. (17) that showed approximately 4 kcal/(mole of tetramer) of ligation-linked structural free energy is associated with Trp37 and its environment. A number other studies have also demonstrated that Trp37 is a major source of quaternary constraint. Specifically, previous studies showed that replacing Trp37 with Tyr, Ala, Gly, and Glu results in progressively disruptive functional changes that include increasing oxygen affinity, increasing CO-combination rates, and decreasing cooperativity (18, 19). For the Gly and Glu mutations (14, 18, 19), the functional properties of the hemoglobin tetramer approach those of isolated R dimers. These functional changes correlate well with progressively disruptive structural changes

The T-to-THigh Transitions in Human Hemoglobin (as observed in crystal structures of the mutant deoxyhemoglobins) that include changes in quaternary structure, changes in subunit tertiary structure, increased mobility of the R subunit COOH-terminal dipeptide, and shortening of the R and Fe-N 2His(F8) bonds (20). The shortening of the FeN 2His(F8) bonds correlates with resonance Raman studies that show a progressive decrease in strain at these bonds (21). Collectively, these findings, as well as more recent crystallographic studies on quaternary-T nitrosylhemoglobin (22), demonstrate a direct linkage between the quaternary constraints associated with Trp37 and the ligand affinity of the heme groups. The crystallographic studies on quaternary-T nitrosylhemoglobin showed that when crystals of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin are exposed to NO the R (but not the ) Fe-N 2His(F8) bond is broken. In contrast, when crystals of W37E deoxyhemoglobin are exposed to NO both the R and Fe-N 2His(F8) bonds remain intact, indicating that ligand-induced strain at the R Fe-N 2His(F8) bond is greatly reduced when the quaternary constraints associated with Trp37 are eliminated (22). The crystallographic studies reported below provide additional independent evidence for the localization of quaternary constraints to the Trp37 cluster. These studies show that as the quaternary constraints are disrupted by mutation or by ligand binding the hemoglobin tetramer undergoes a series of progressive quaternary transitions from the quaternary-T structure of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin to an ensemble of related T-like quaternary structures. Analysis of the tertiary and quaternary changes in these structures reveals different stereochemical pathways for the R and subunits by which ligand binding specifically disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37 cluster. MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation and Crystallization of Variant Hemoglobins. Preparation of the variant human hemoglobins by the core facilities of NIH sponsored Program Project Grant GM58890 was described previously (14). Due to differences in amino terminal processing in Escherichia coli and humans, the recombinant proteins also have innocuous RV1M or V1M mutations (23-26). Crystals of all the variant hemoglobins were grown at room temperature in the deoxy form from PEG1 solutions as first described by Ward et al. (27) with the addition of a seeding step (20, 28). In summary, deoxyhemoglobin crystals were grown from solutions consisting of 10 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.0, 100 mM potassium chloride, 3 mM sodium dithionite, 10.0% PEG 6000, and 10 mg/mL hemoglobin. All solutions were deoxygenated with pure nitrogen, and all the crystallization and crystal handling procedures were carried out in a nitrogen-filled glovebox or glovebag. In order to collect diffraction data under anaerobic conditions, crystals were washed in substitute mother liquor that contained all the nonprotein components of the original crystallization solution, but with the PEG concentration increased to 13%, and then mounted under nitrogen in quartz capillaries for data collection. Exposing Crystals of Deoxyhemoglobin to Oxygen. For some variant hemoglobins diffraction data also were collected

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 16, 2005 6103 after exposure to oxygen. In the case of the 37 mutants, the crystals were exposed to oxygen by simply opening the capillary tube to air. In contrast, crystals of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and the non- 37 mutants disorder when exposed to air at room temperature. However, Paoli et al. (29) found that, at 4 °C and in the presence of IHP (inositol hexaphosphate), wild-type deoxyhemoglobin crystals can bind oxygen to all four heme groups without disordering. In the present study, a similar procedure was used to expose crystals of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and the non- 37 mutants to oxygen. Specifically, deoxyhemoglobin crystals first were stabilized by soaking for approximately 18 h in the substitute mother liquor mentioned above with the PEG concentration increased to 20% and the addition of 2.2 mM IHP. Once soaked, the crystals were transferred anaerobically to a substitute liquor that did not contain dithionite and cooled to 4 °C. Finally, at 4 °C, the crystals were exposed to oxygen for 2 h, at a pressure of 1 atm, and then mounted in oxygenfilled quartz capillaries. Twelve hours after the crystals were exposed to oxygen, diffraction data were collected at -4 °C. Similar experiments with wild-type deoxyhemoglobin crystals also were carried out with IHP concentrations of 5 mM, 10 mM, and 20 mM in order to study the effect of IHP concentration on ligand-induced structural changes. Diffraction Data Collection. For some crystals, diffraction data were collected with a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator that was fitted with an AFC6 diffractometer, a graphite monochromator, and a San Diego Multiwire Systems area detector. The diffraction data for other crystals were collected with a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator that was fitted with Osmic Confocal Max-Flux Optics and an R-AXIS IV++ area detector from Molecular Structure Corporation. All the diffraction data were collected on unfrozen crystals. For data collected with X-rays filtered by the graphite monochromator, the hemoglobin crystals were mounted in sealed quartz capillary tubes in the usual way (i.e., they were held in place by surface tension against the inner wall of the capillary tube). However, crystals mounted in this way degraded rapidly when exposed to X-rays filtered by the Osmic Confocal Max-Flux Optics. This problem was circumvented by mounting the hemoglobin crystals in sealed capillary tubes that were completely filled with the substitute mother liquor. In this case, the crystals were held in place with cotton fibers (30). Diffraction data collected on the San Diego Multiwire Systems area detector were scaled and merged according to the procedures of Howard et al. (31). Diffraction data collected on the R-AXIS IV++ area detector were processed using the MOSFLM (32) and SCALA (33) programs as incorporated in the CCP4 software package (34). Diffraction data statistics are summarized in Table 1. Refinement of Deoxyhemoglobin Structures. The initial atomic model for each of the subunit variants was the tetrameric deoxy V1M structure (26) in which the mutated residue was replaced with alanine (or by glycine in the case of the glycine mutations). The initial atomic model for each of the R subunit variants was the tetrameric structure of wildtype deoxyhemoglobin (35) in which the mutated residue was replaced with alanine (or glycine where appropriate). (Met1R was modeled as an alanine residue throughout the refinement process because the methionine side chain atoms are disordered and not visible in electron density images.) These starting models were subjected to rigid-body refine-

Structural changes outside the radius of convergence of PROLSQ or REFMAC5 were manually incorporated with the TOM/FRODO software (39, 40). In all cases, the diffraction data were split into test and working data sets that comprised 10% and 90% of the total X-ray diffraction data, respectively. The test and working data sets for the R subunit and subunit variants were matched to those of wildtype deoxyhemoglobin and deoxy V1M, respectively, to allow for the calculation of the Rfree statistic (41) throughout the refinement process. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Refinement and Rlocal-5 Cross-Validation of Oxygenated free Hemoglobin Crystal Structures. Each oxygenated crystal structure was refined and the oxygen-induced structural changes validated using the protocols recently described by Chan et al. (22). In brief, each deoxyhemoglobin diffraction data set was randomly divided into a test data set consisting of 10% of the data and a working data set consisting of the remaining 90% of the data. The deoxyhemoglobin atomic model was debiased (42) relative to the test data set by carrying out more than 600 cycles of maximum-likelihood refinement using REFMAC5. The resulting model was used as a starting model for refinement against the corresponding oxygenated diffraction data that were divided into the same test and working data sets as the deoxy diffraction data. The refinement consisted of rigid-body refinement using X-PLOR followed by maximum-likelihood refinement using REFMAC5. (Only rigid-body refinement was run for the IHP stabilized Y35A crystal exposed to oxygen because the diffraction data for this crystal are very low resolution (Table 1).) Structural changes outside the radius of convergence of REFMAC5 were manually incorporated with the TOM/ FRODO software. During the process, oxygen ligands were added to the atomic model, but a molecule of IHP was not included. [As stated above, IHP was added to crystals of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and crystals of the non-37 deoxyhemoglobin variants in order to prevent crystal disordering after exposure to oxygen. However, a molecule of IHP was not added to these atomic models because little or no significant electron density was observed for IHP in its binding site at the entrance to the central cavity between the subunits. Waller and Liddington, working with the same crystal form of the deoxyhemoglobin-IHP complex, also reported very weak electron density for IHP (43). Since the addition of IHP prevents oxygen-induced crystal disordering (43), IHP apparently binds to and stabilizes the quaternary-T hemoglobin tetramer. However, in this orthorhombic crystal lattice it must bind in a more disordered mode than in the monoclinic crystal lattice previously used by Arnone and Perutz to study the deoxyhemoglobin-IHP complex (44).] The Rlocal-5 statistic (20, 22) was used to validate tertiary free structure changes induced by oxygenation of the deoxyhemoglobin crystals. This statistic uses the unbiased test data set to cross-validate small tertiary structure differences between the deoxy and oxygenated crystal structures. That is, the localized oxygen-induced changes in tertiary structure that were introduced during the second stage of the refinement (the REFMAC5 and TOM/FRODO refinement) were

Kavanaugh et al. cross-validated through the use of "hybrid" atomic models. Specifically, after convergence of the final REFMAC5 refinement cycles, hybrid atomic models were generated by replacing the coordinates of each pentapeptide in the final REFMAC5 refined model with the coordinates of the corresponding pentapeptide of the atomic model that had undergone only rigid-body refinement (but not individual atom refinement). The coordinates for each of these hybrid models were identical to those of the final refined model except for a single (unrefined) pentapeptide. The standard Rfree value (41) calculated with a particular hybrid model minus the standard Rfree value calculated with the final atomic model is defined as the Rlocal-5 value associated with the free replaced pentapeptide. If the structural changes associated with a particular pentapeptide represent a genuine improvement to the starting model, the corresponding Rlocal-5 value free should be significantly greater than zero. Plotting the Rlocal-5 parameter versus residue number generates a profile free that can be used to discriminate between small genuine structural changes and those changes in the atomic model that are due to experimental uncertainty (i.e., uncertainty associated with poorly defined regions of the electron density map). Because only 10% of the diffraction data are used to generate a Rlocal-5 profile, spurious signals may appear and free genuine changes in structure may not cross-validate. However, the sensitivity of the Rlocal-5 parameter is dramatically free improved by carrying out multiple calculations with different, mutually exclusive, test data sets. That is, the Rlocal-5 free calculation can be repeated 10 times. In each case, the calculation is started with a deoxyhemoglobin model that is debiased relative to one of 10 mutually exclusive test data sets. Averaging the 10 resulting Rlocal-5 profiles generates a free Rlocal-5 profile that uses of all the diffraction data to crossfree validate tertiary structural changes. Structural Analysis. The following criteria were used to identify strong noncovalent interactions at the dimer-dimer interface. For each type of interaction, a contact is counted only if each of the interacting atoms has a temperature factor of 50 Å2 or less. A polar contact was defined as an atomic interaction of less than 3.2 Å between a pair of polar atoms. A nonpolar contact was defined as an atomic interaction of less than 3.5 Å between two nonpolar atoms or between a polar and a nonpolar atom. Interactions of 3.2-3.5 Å between two polar atoms were counted as nonpolar contacts. A water bridge was defined as a [polar atom,,,water,,,polar atom] interaction where both water hydrogen bonds are less than 3.2 Å. All interactions between 3.5 and 3.8 Å were classified as general weak contacts. Rigid-body screw-rotation analysis (45, 46) was used to characterize mutation- and ligation-induced quaternary structure transitions. These transitions have two components: an interdimer rigid-body rotation of the R1 1 dimer relative to the R2 2 dimer as well as an intradimer rigid-body rotation of an R subunit relative to a subunit. The approach for analyzing interdimer rotation has been described in detail by Mueser et al. (47). In brief, the following steps are involved. First each tetramer is placed in a standard orientation with the dyad axis of the tetramer positioned along the y-axis of the coordinate system. Next the atomic coordinates for the backbone atoms of the R1 1 and R2 2 dimers of

Kavanaugh et al. each tetramer are averaged about the dyad axis. Then a "sieve-fit" iterative least-squares superposition similar to that described by Gerstein and Chothia (20, 48) is used to superimpose the R1 1 dimers of a pair of hemoglobin tetramers and to identify the backbone atoms of the R1 1 "static core". As a global measure of the magnitude of a quaternary structure difference, the parameter Q is defined as the rms deviation of the backbone atoms of the nonsuperimposed R2 2 static core. Next, the R2 2 dimers are superimposed, and the set of screw-rotation parameters associated with this second superposition describes the magnitude and direction of the dimer-dimer rotation. Only four independent parameters are required to uniquely specify the screw-rotation transformation for dimer-dimer rotation (47): one direction angle of the screw rotation axis (R or ), the y-intercept (yint) of the screw rotation axis, the magnitude of rotation (Frot), and the translation distance (). The intradimer rigid-body rotation was determined in a similar manner. First the "sieve-fit" superposition was used to superimpose the 1 subunits of a pair of hemoglobin R1 1 dimers and to identify the backbone atoms of the 1 static core. Then the R1 subunits were superimposed, and the set of screw-rotation parameters associated with this second superposition describes the magnitude and direction of intradimer rotation. The main parameter of interest in this case is the magnitude of intradimer rotation, referred to below as the intradimer bending angle (Fbend). To identify oxygen-induced changes in tertiary structure, corresponding subunits of the deoxy and oxygenated structures were superimposed using the sieve-fit procedure. Concerted changes in tertiary structure were identified by calculating 5 plots as previously described (20). In addition, the rms deviation of all the atoms (backbone plus side chain atoms) was calculated for each pair of corresponding pentapeptides in the superimposed subunits. This statistic, referred to as rmsd5, is plotted versus residue number to generate a profile of the five-residue-averaged tertiary structure changes. A five-residue window was selected so that the 5 and rmsd5 values corresponded with the Rlocal-5 free values (above). RESULTS Mutation-Induced Quaternary Structure Transitions: Interdimer Rotation. Rigid-body analysis of mutation-induced R1 1/R2 2 interdimer rotation is shown in Table 2, where the entries are sorted on the absolute value of the interdimer rotation angle Frot, which varies from 0° to 2.1°. Table entries are color-coded according to the ratio of the mutant to wildtype CO-combination rate constants as reported by Noble el al. (14). The ratio Q/ (i.e. the ratio of the rms deviation of the non-superimposed R2 2 static core to the rms deviation of the superimposed R1 1 static core) is a measure of the significance of the interdimer rotation angle Frot. The P100G and P100A mutations clearly induce significant interdimer rotations with rotation magnitudes of 2.1° and 1.3° and Q/ values of 7.1 and 5.5, respectively. But these mutation-induced transitions have screw-rotation axes that appear be unique to this residue. On the other hand, the mutation-induced R1 1/R2 2 interdimer rotations associated with the W37G, W37E, desArg141R, W37A, P36A, and W37Y mutations reflect a more general and

a The entries in this table are color-coded according to the ratio of the mutant to wild-type CO-combination rate constants as reported by Noble el al. (14) as follows: red >5, orange 2.6-5, green 1.6-2.5, and light blue 0.7-1.5. Entries in black display heterogeneous CO-combination kinetics in the presence of IHP (see Noble et al. (14)).

fundamental mode of relaxing the quaternary constraints imposed by the Trp37 cluster. These six mutation-induced transitions have very similar screw-rotation axes (with an average R direction angle of 108° (( 5°) and an average y-intercept of -13.7 Å (( 4.4 Å)), positive screw-rotation angles that vary from +0.6° to +2.0°, and large Q/ values that vary from 2.4 to 6.8. Moreover, since the mutations associated with the three residues Arg141R, Pro36 , and Trp37 all disrupt quaternary constraints in the Trp37 cluster and result in high ligand-affinity structures (as indicated by the color-coding in Table 2), we refer to them as THigh structures and the rigid-body transitions as T-toTHigh transitions. All the other mutations listed in Table 2 (those below the thick line) induce transitions with small

rotation magnitudes (-0.5° to +0.6°), lower Q/ values, and more or less randomly oriented and positioned screwrotation axes. The fact that six mutations of three residues resulted in very similar screw-rotation transitions could be a coincidence. However, as discussed below, ligand binding also induces very similar R1 1/R2 2 screw-rotation transitions. That is, breaking quaternary constraints in the Trp37 cluster by mutation or by ligation induces the same quaternary relaxation.

pattern becomes useless for X-ray data collection. In contrast, crystals of the deoxyhemoglobin 37 mutants can be exposed to air at room temperature without disordering. Electron density images show that diatomic oxygen is bound to all four heme groups in these crystals, and rigid-body screwrotation analysis (for the four 37 entries in Table 3) shows that the ligation-induced transitions have very similar screwrotation axes (the average R direction angle is 108° ((5°) and the average y-intercept is -14.4 Å ((1.5 Å)) and positive screw-rotation angles that vary from +4.5° to +5.6°. Moreover, these ligand-induced screw-rotation axes are very similar to the mutation-induced screw-rotation axes described above. That is, when crystals of the deoxyhemoglobin 37 mutants are exposed to air, oxygen binding induces further rotation about a T-to-THigh screw-rotation axis. As indicated in the [R(Zn+2) W37E(Fe+2-O2)]2 structure (referred to as W37E(RZn),2O2,0 mM IHP in Table 3), the same is true when ligand is bound to only the subunits. A T-to-THigh

transition also is observed in the W37E,4NO,0 mM IHP structure, but in this case the screw-rotation magnitude is slightly larger than it is in W37E,4O2,0 mM IHP. Ligation-Induced Quaternary Structure Transitions in Wild-Type Hemoglobin and in the Non- 37 Mutants: Interdimer Rotation. Crystals of the other deoxyhemoglobin mutants (i.e., the non- 37 mutants) behave like wild-type deoxyhemoglobin crystals in that they disorder when exposed to air at room temperature and, therefore, are not useful for X-ray diffraction experiments. Since Paoli et al. (29) found that, at 4 °C and in the presence of IHP, wild-type deoxyhemoglobin crystals can bind oxygen without disordering, a similar approach was applied to study ligand-induced transitions in mutant hemoglobin crystals. The results from these experiments (Table 4) fall into two groups with slightly different screw-rotation axes. The transitions in the first group (the first five entries in Table 4) all involve residues that are part of the Trp37 cluster and have high ligand affinity

The T-to-THigh Transitions in Human Hemoglobin as indicated by the color-coding in Table 4 (except for Val33 which is located on the edge of the cluster). The ligation-induced transitions associated with the first group have very similar screw-rotation axes (i.e., an average R direction angle of 108° ((4°) and an average y-intercept of -13.9 Å ((1.2 Å)) that are spatially close to the T-to-THigh rotation axes observed for the deoxy Trp37 cluster mutants and the liganded 37 mutants. The screw-rotation angles for the first group vary from +2.3° to +5.9°. The second group consists of only three mutant hemoglobins and wild-type hemoglobin. Two of the mutants, H97A and P100A, are not part of the Trp37 cluster and have normal ligand affinity (as indicated by the color-coding in Table 4). Although the third mutant, Y35F, is within the Trp37 cluster, it is a conservative mutation that does not greatly disrupt quaternary constraints since its COcombination rate is the same as that of wild-type hemoglobin (49). The second group has ligation-induced transitions with very similar screw-rotation axes (an average R direction angle of 123° ((5°) and an average y-intercept of -9.7 Å ((3.0 Å)) that are significantly different from the first group. The ligation-induced rotation angles for wild-type hemoglobin and for the three mutants in the second group vary from +0.6° to +1.4°, which is significantly smaller than those of the first group. It is interesting to note that, for one member of this second group, P100A, the ligation-induced transition is about the wild-type screw-rotation axis even through the mutation-induced transition (see above) is about a very different axis. The T-to-THigh Screw-Rotation Axes Are Independent of the Crystal Lattice. It is possible that the similarity of the T-to-THigh screw-rotation axes observed for the mutation- and ligand-induced quaternary structure changes is the result of the common crystal lattice used in the experiments described above. However, our analysis of a fully liganded structure previously reported by Kroeger and Kundrot (50) indicates that this is not the case. This crystal structure, referred to as the B-state by Kroeger and Kundrot, is of the cyanomet form of rHb1.1. (rHb1.1 is a recombinant hemoglobin, containing the mutation N108K, in which the COOH-terminus of the R1 subunit is cross-linked to the NH2-terminus of the R2 subunit by a glycine bridge.) Importantly, cyanomet rHb1.1 was crystallized in a space group that is different from the low-salt crystal form of hemoglobin used in the experiments reported in this paper. As shown in Table 4, our analysis of this structure shows that the B-state is a THigh tetramer with a T-to-THigh screw-rotation axis that falls within the range of the axes in the first group of IHP stabilized THigh structures described above but with a rotation magnitude that is significantly larger (Frot ) 8.6°). Therefore, we can conclude that the T-to-THigh transitions are an inherent property of the hemoglobin tetramer. The Influence of IHP on Ligand-Induced Interdimer Rotation. The fact that very similar T-to-THigh rotation axes are observed when the 37 mutants are exposed to air and when the IHP stabilized non- 37 mutants are exposed to oxygen implies that IHP does not greatly influence the direction of the T-to-THigh transition. Further evidence of this conjecture was obtained by determining the ligand-induced screw-rotation axis for the W37A-IHP complex exposed to air at room temperature and for the W37H-IHP complex exposed to oxygen at -4 °C. In the case of the W37A-

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 16, 2005 6109 IHP complex the screw-rotation parameters were R ) 102.8°, y ) -11.2 Å, Frot ) 5.6°, and in the case of the W37HIHP complex the screw-rotation parameters were R ) 106.2°, y ) -13.0 Å, Frot ) 4.8°. From these data, it is clear that IHP does not greatly influence the direction of the T-toTHigh transition. However, from the results presented below it is clear that IHP can influence the magnitude of the T-toTHigh transition in crystalline hemoglobin. Experiments were carried out to determine the influence of IHP concentration on the T-to-THigh transition in wildtype hemoglobin. Specifically, crystals of wild-type hemoglobin were soaked in the substitute mother liquor that contained either 5 mM IHP, 10 mM IHP, or 20 mM IHP (instead of 2.2 mM as in the above experiments) and exposed to oxygen. A diffraction data set collected at -4 °C on a crystal soaked in 5 mM IHP revealed a T-to-THigh transition that is essentially identical to that observed at 2.2 mM IHP (Table 4). In contrast, a larger ligand-induced T-to-THigh transition was observed for the crystal soaked in 10 mM IHP (Table 4). Specifically, increasing the IHP concentration to 10 mM changed the direction of the T-to-THigh screw-rotation axis by -10° and increased Frot from 0.6° to 4.3°, making it more similar to the ligand-induced T-to-THigh transitions observed for the Trp37 cluster mutants (see Table 4). The reason for the large increase in the magnitude of the T-toTHigh transition is not clear. It may be due to increased IHP occupancy at the organic phosphate binding site (although no increase in electron density at the IHP binding site was evident), or it may be that the increase in ionic strength caused by the highly charged IHP molecule weakened lattice constraints and allowed a larger T-to-THigh transition to occur. When crystals soaked in 20 mM IHP were exposed to oxygen, the diffraction pattern degraded dramatically, making it impossible to collect usable diffraction data. This result is consistent with the possibility that high IHP concentrations weaken the lattice constraints. Mutation- and Ligation-Induced Changes in R Dimer Quaternary Structure: Intradimer Bending. In the initial comparison of liganded and deoxy horse hemoglobin, Perutz et al. (51) noted the following: "In the transition from oxy to deoxyhaemoglobin, movement in the contact R1 1 is slight; relative to the R1 subunit, the 1 subunit rotates by 3.7° about a screw axis and moves by 0.3 Å along it." However, they felt that the functional importance of this bending motion was unclear. To the best of our knowledge, this bending motion has never been mentioned in any subsequent publications analyzing hemoglobin structure. In fact, most subsequent analyses of ligand-induced structural changes in hemoglobin have treated the R dimer as a rigid structure that does not change upon ligand binding (46, 52). We have carried out rigid-body screw-rotation analyses of intradimer bending for all the ligation-induced T-to-THigh transitions as well as for the T-to-R and T-to-R2 transitions. We find that R dimer bending is associated with all these transitions with magnitudes (Fbend) that vary from 0.8° to 3.9°. The largest bending magnitudes, 3.7° and 3.9°, occur for the T-to-R and T-to-R2 transitions, respectively. (The T-to-R value is in excellent agreement with Perutz's initial measurement on liganded and deoxy horse hemoglobin (51).) With regard to the ligand-induced T-to-THigh transitions, the R dimer bending magnitudes (Tables 3 and 4) range from 0.8° (in wild-type crystals soaked in 2.2 mM IHP) to 3.6° (in

The displacements of the W37E(RZn),2O2,0 mM IHP and RR92A,4O2,2.2 mM IHP R1 subunits relative to the wild-type R1 subunit represent 1.9° and 3.0° of ligand-induced intradimer bending, respectively. In the case of W37E(RZn),2O2,0 mM IHP the intradimer bending is associated with ligand binding to only the subunits, since the R subunits cannot bind oxygen. The side chain of Asp94R1 is shown for deoxyhemoglobin, W37E(RZn),2O2,0 mM IHP, and RR92A,4O2,2.2 mM IHP (light blue, dashed, and magenta, respectively), and the side chain of Trp37 2 is shown for deoxyhemoglobin (green) and for RR92A,4O2,2.2 mM IHP (red). The bending motion alone (i.e., in the absence of interdimer rotation) is capable of disrupting interactions in the Trp37 2 cluster, which can be seen as the movement of Asp94R1 in W37E(RZn),2O2,0 mM IHP (dashed) and in RR92A,4O2,2.2 mM IHP (magenta) away from the side chain of Trp37 2 in deoxyhemoglobin (green). In the absence of interdimer rotation, intradimer bending also creates close contacts of less than 2 Å between Trp37 2 (green) and the main chain of Arg92R1. Interdimer rotation relieves this steric clash as Trp37 2 (red) moves away from the R1 subunit.

cyanomet rHb1.1). Rigid-body analysis of the deoxy mutants shows that intradimer bending also occurs in mutants in which there is interdimer rotation about a T-to-THigh screw rotation axis. Specifically, mutation-induced intradimer bending magnitudes of 0.5°, 0.6°, 0.6°, 0.9°, 1.2°, and 1.2° are observed for P36A, W37Y, desArg141R, W37A, W37E, and W37G, respectively. The R dimer bending motion occurs in T-to-THigh transitions in a way that can disrupt the Trp37 cluster of quaternary constraints. Intradimer dimer bending can be analyzed by superimposing (using the sieve-fit procedure) one subunit of a liganded R1 1 dimer onto the corresponding subunit of deoxyhemoglobin. Dimer bending can then displayed as the relative movement of the non-superimposed pair of subunits. This is illustrated in Figure 2 where the 1 subunits of two liganded THigh structures have been superimposed on the 1 subunit of deoxyhemoglobin. The displacement of the non-superimposed R1 subunits in this figure corresponds to 1.9° and 3.0° of intradimer dimer bending for W37E(RZn),2O2,0 mM IHP and RR92A,4O2,2.2 mM IHP, respectively. It is clear from Figure 2 that the R dimer bending motion is leveraged over the distance between the 1 heme and the FG-corner/G-helix of the R1 subunit such that residues 92R1 through 95R1 move by 1 Å or more. This motion widens the distance and disrupts the polar interaction between Asp94R1 and Trp37 2, and in the absence of interdimer rotation, generates a steric clash (a 2.0 Å nonbonded contact) between the backbone atoms of Arg92R1 and Trp37 2. This steric clash is relieved by R1 1/ R2 2 interdimer rotation. Correlation between Interdimer Rotation and Intradimer Bending. The above analysis suggests that intradimer bending and interdimer rotation are structurally linked and should be highly correlated. This is in fact observed for all the mutation-induced and ligation-induced T-to-THigh transitions

(Figure 3). The correlation also holds for the cyanomet rHb1.1 structure. Since cyanomet rHb1.1 was crystallized in the fully liganded form directly from solution, and in a different crystal lattice, the correlation between the magnitudes of R dimer bending and R dimer rotation also must be an intrinsic property of the hemoglobin molecule. We can conclude that the loss of quaternary constraints, either by mutation or ligation or both, results in the relaxation of the hemoglobin tetramer via the coordinated motions of interdimer rotation and intradimer bending. Ligand-Induced R Subunit Tertiary Structure Changes Associated with T-to-THigh Transitions. When crystallographic methods are used to characterize small tertiary structure changes caused by mutation or the binding of ligand, a fundamental issue that should be specifically addressed is the validity of these small changes in structure. That is, it must be determined if these are genuine structural changes that are due to ligand binding or mutation, or if they are simply due to small random variations in atomic positions that are to be expected in any X-ray structure determination. One way to establish the validity of a small change in structure is to demonstrate that it occurs in two or more pairs of structures that were independently determined in the same crystal lattice (i.e., by making use of noncrystallographic symmetry) or in different crystal lattices. The Rlocal-5 free parameter (described above) provides a second, complementary approach to the verification of small changes in tertiary structure. It has recently been used to validate small mutationinduced changes in hemoglobin tertiary structure (53) and tertiary structure changes induced by the binding of nitric oxide to deoxyhemoglobin crystals (22). Figure 4 illustrates the detection and characterization of valid O2-induced R subunit tertiary structure changes that are associated with the T-to-THigh transition in W37A.

Specifically, shown in Figure 4 are plots of R chain rmsd5, 5, Rlocal-5, and B5 profiles (see caption) for the T-to-THigh free transition in W37A hemoglobin where each parameter has been calculated over all overlapping five-residue peptides. The Rlocal-5 profile in Figure 4c was used to identify and free cross-validate five regions of ligand-induced changes in R subunit tertiary structure that are labeled 1R through 5R and highlighted by color-coded bars. The largest Rlocal-5 feafree tures, 4R and 5R, correspond to the largest peaks in the rmsd5 and 5 profiles (Figure 4a and Figure 4b) which occur at the R F-helix/FG-corner and the R C-terminus, respectively. The structural changes in R F-helix/FG-corner stereochemistry show that the central portion of feature 4R corresponds to an R-to- helix transition at the COOH-terminal end of the F-helix (see below). This transition results in a large shift in the position of the His87R-Ala88R dipeptide toward Tyr140R as illustrated in Figure 5 where the R1 subunits of deoxyhemoglobin and W37A,4O2 have been superimposed. In liganded W37A, the steric collision between Ala88R1

The rmsd5 parameter is the root-mean-square-deviation in R subunit atomic coordinates calculated after the R subunits of W37A,4O2,0 mM IHP have been superimposed (using the sieve-fit procedure) on the corresponding subunits of deoxyhemoglobin. 5 is the magnitude of the atomic displacement vector for the backbone atoms of a five-residue peptide as defined in Kavanaugh et al. (20). The 5 profile in panel b is local-5 the average of the 5 profiles for the R1 and R2 subunits. Rfree  is a cross-validation statistic that is sensitive only to local changes in tertiary structure (see Materials and Methods). Positive local-5 Rfree  values identify five regions of valid changes in structure that are labeled 1R through 5R (top of figure) and highlighted by colored bars. The B5 profiles are the average atomic temperature factors for all the atoms in a given pentapeptide of the wild-type deoxyhemoglobin R subunits. In panels a and d the R1 and R2 subunit profiles are drawn in thin and thick lines, respectively. The globin helical boundaries are indicated along the bottom axis.

and Tyr140R1 is relieved by the movement of the Tyr140R1 side chain (feature 5R) into the R1 2 interface. Specifically, the Tyr140R1 side chain moves into the area occupied by Trp37 2 in deoxyhemoglobin. The Rlocal-5 profile in Figure 4c also includes three free small peaks labeled 1R, 2R, and 3R. Feature 1R corresponds to very small movements in residues 38R-42R which pack against residues responsible for the much larger shifts in feature 4R. These small movements have a significant impact on the Rlocal-5 statistic because the atoms in residues free

Color-coding corresponds to the polypeptide local-5 segments identified in the Rfree  profile in Figure 4c. Residues 35 2 through 37 2 are displayed in black lines. For clarity, a water molecule that is bound in the distal heme pocket of deoxyhemoglobin has been omitted from the figure.

38R-42R have very low temperature factors (Figure 4d). Feature 2R corresponds to the distal histidine, His58R, and its flanking residues which shift slightly to accommodate the ligand. Feature 3R corresponds to residues in the EFcorner which shift in response to the large movements of the residues in the adjacent F-helix (feature 4R). There are few small peaks in the rmsd5 and 5 profiles that do not cross-validate in the Rlocal-5 profile. In general, these free peaks correspond to regions of the R subunit that have high intrinsic temperature factors and therefore high mobility and large positional variation. These results highlight the ability of the Rlocal-5 statistic to reveal small structural changes free and to distinguish genuine structural perturbations from random fluctuations. R subunit tertiary structure changes (not shown) very similar to those that occur in W37A,4O2 are observed for the O2-induced T-to-THigh transitions associated with Trp37 cluster mutant hemoglobins and HbA,4O2,10 mM IHP where Frot is large. For the O2-induced T-to-THigh transitions where Frot is small, smaller tertiary structural changes (not shown) are observed in the same regions described above. In all cases, the largest structural change occurs at the end of the F-helix (feature 4R). Ligand-Induced Changes in the Secondary Structure of the R F-Helix. Detailed analysis of the F-helix hydrogen bonding distances in V1M, W37A, W37A,4O2, and the quaternary R2 structure of carbonmonoxyhemoglobin reveals a ligand-induced secondary structure transition that occurs at the COOH-terminal end of the R F helix. The data shown in Table 5 can be summarized as follows: residues F1 through F5 make only 1f4 hydrogen bonds (the 1f5 distances are greater than 4.0 Å) in all four structures, residue F6 makes only a 1f4 hydrogen bond in the two deoxy structures but it makes bifurcated 1f4/1f5 hydrogen bonds in the W37A,4O2 and R2 structures (with a weak 1f5 hydrogen bond in W37A,4O2), residue F7 makes bifurcated 1f4/1f5 hydrogen bonds in the deoxy structures and a

weak 1f4 hydrogen bond and a strong 1f5 hydrogen bond in the W37A,4O2 and R2 structures, and residue F8 (the proximal histidine) makes only a 1f5 hydrogen bond in the deoxy structures but bifurcated 1f5/1f6 hydrogen bonds in the W37A,4O2 and R2 structures. That is, ligand binding induces a switch in the hydrogen bonding pattern at the COOH-terminal end of the R F-helix. In deoxyhemoglobin, residue F6 has the hydrogen bonding pattern of an R helix, residue F7 has a hydrogen bonding pattern that is midway between an R helix and a  helix, and residue F8 has the hydrogen bonding pattern of a  helix. In both the W37A, 4O2 and R2 structures, residue F6 has a hydrogen bonding pattern that is midway between an R helix and a  helix, residue F7 has a hydrogen bonding pattern that favors a  helix, and residue F8 has the hydrogen bonding pattern of an expanded  helix. Thus ligand binding induces a "bulge" in the COOH-terminal end of the R F-helix of the THigh W37A,4O2 structure that is comparable to the R F-helix bulge in the quaternary R2 structure. Widening the COOHterminal end of the R F-helix forces Ala88(F9)R into Tyr140R, disrupting the Trp37 cluster (Figure 5). Ligand-Induced Subunit Tertiary Structure Changes Associated with T-to-THigh Transitions. Figure 6 illustrates the detection and characterization of O2-induced subunit tertiary structure changes that are associated with the T-toTHigh transition in W37A hemoglobin. The Rlocal-5 profree file in Figure 6c was used to identify and cross-validate six regions of ligand-induced changes in subunit tertiary structure that are labeled 1 through 6 and highlighted by color-coded bars. The same six regions of tertiary structure change were observed in crystalline wild-type deoxyhemoglobin that was exposed to nitric oxide (22). The key structural difference between the response of the subunits and the response of the R subunits to the binding of ligand (whether the ligand is O2 or NO) is that a ligand-induced movement of the heme group occurs only in the subunits. The -heme movement consists of a rotation of approxi-

mately 5° that shifts pyrrole ring A toward the distal side of the heme pocket and pyrrole ring C by about 0.8 Å toward the NH2-terminal end of the G-helix on the proximal side of the heme pocket (Figure 7). The ligation-induced movement of the -heme group in turn induces shifts in residues in regions 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 (Figure 6) so that optimal packing interactions with the heme are maintained (Figure 7). As in the R subunits, the distal histidine, His63(E7) , and flanking residues (region 3 ) shift position in order to accommodate the ligand. The residues in region 1 shift because they are in direct van der Waals contact with the residues in region 3 . There are few small peaks in the rmsd5 and 5 profiles that do not cross-validate in the Rlocal-5 free profile. In general, these peaks correspond to regions of the subunit that have high intrinsic temperature factors and therefore high mobility and large positional variation.

As in the case of R subunits, subunit tertiary structure changes very similar to those that occur in W37A are observed for the O2-induced T-to-THigh transitions associated with Trp37 cluster mutant hemoglobins and HbA,4O2,10 mM IHP where Frot is large (not shown). For the O2-induced T-to-THigh transitions where Frot is small, smaller tertiary structural changes are observed in the same regions of the subunits (not shown). Heme Relaxation in Liganded Quaternary THigh Structures. Ligand-induced changes in the heme Fe out-of-plane distance and the Fe-N 2His bond length are intrinsic properties of the heme prosthetic group that initiate changes in globin tertiary structure (7, 8, 54). In particular, crystal structures of oxy and deoxy imidazole-porphyrin model compounds show that the addition of oxygen as an axial ligand results in a 0.1 Å shortening of the Fe-imidazole bond and a 0.3-0.4 Å movement of the Fe atom into the porphyrin plane (54-56). Similar differences are observed in the deoxy quaternary-T and liganded quaternary-R structures of hemoglobin and are the initial events in Perutz's stereochemical mechanism of hemoglobin action (7, 8, 54). Small differences in the Fe-N 2His bond lengths cannot be accurately determine in hemoglobin structures of moderate (3.0 Å to 1.5 Å) resolution. However, estimates of the Fe-

FIGURE 7: Stereodiagram showing the environment of the 1 heme group in wild-type deoxyhemoglobin (thin lines) and W37A,4O2,0 mM IHP (thick lines) after the 1 subunits were superimposed using the sieve-fit procedure. Color-coding corresponds to the polypeptide local-5 segments identified in the Rfree  profile in Figure 6c.

N 2His bond lengths can be obtained using a previously described iterative method to minimize restraint bias (20). In this method, target values for the Fe-N 2His bond length are systematically varied until the residual (i.e., the refined value of Fe-N 2His bond length minus the target value of Fe-N 2His bond length) is zero. The displacement of the Fe atom from the heme plane can be determined with greater accuracy than the Fe-N 2His bond length because the heme plane is defined as the least-squares plane of the large 24atom porphyrin macrocycle and the electron-dense Fe atom can be precisely positioned. The Fe-N 2His bond lengths and the heme Fe out-of-plane distances are reported in Table 6 for "zero residual" THigh structures refined against diffraction data sets with resolutions between 1.8 Å and 2.9 Å. In deoxyhemoglobin (the deoxy V1M and deoxy HbA quaternary-T structures in Table 6) the R and subunit Fe-N 2His bond lengths are similar with an average value of 2.25 Å, and the Fe atoms of the R and heme groups are displaced out of the heme plane toward the proximal histidine by -0.60 Å and -0.38 Å, respectively. In the structure of quatermary-R2 carbonmonoxyhemoglobin (which is representative of liganded Re ensemble structures), the R and subunit Fe-N 2His bond lengths have an average value of 2.11 Å, and the Fe atoms of the R and heme groups are displaced out of the heme plane toward the proximal histidine by only -0.04 Å and -0.07 Å, respectively. In all the THigh structures, the R heme Fe atoms have shifted toward the heme planes but remain partially displaced toward the proximal side with average out-of-plane distances of -0.20 ( 0.05 Å. This movement amounts to 70% of the total shift between the deoxy quaternary-T and the liganded quaternary-R2 structures. In the subunits of the THigh structures, the Fe atom also appears to shift toward the

The T-to-THigh Transitions in Human Hemoglobin globin. In contrast, the R subunit Fe-N 2His bond lengths appear to be a function of Frot. In the THigh structures characterized by large interdimer rotations (Frot values greater than 4°) the R subunit Fe-N 2His bond lengths shorten to an average value (2.04 ( 0.06 Å) that is close to value observed in quatermary-R2 carbonmonoxyhemoglobin. However, in the THigh structures with Frot values less than 4°, the R subunit Fe-N 2His bond lengths do not shorten; i.e., they have an average value of 2.23 ( 0.07 Å that is very close to that of quaternary-T deoxyhemoglobin. Therefore, it appears that R and Fe-N 2His bonds respond differently to the binding of ligand to quaternary-T hemoglobin. In the R subunits, the Fe-N 2His bond does not shorten in response to ligand binding until the majority of quaternary constraints associated with the Trp37 cluster and the R COOH-termini are broken (see below). DISCUSSION The Quaternary Structures of Liganded Hemoglobin Are Distributed OVer Two Distinct Ensembles. For many years, the X-ray crystallographic studies on hemoglobin were consistent with the conventional view (i.e., the textbook scenario) that allosteric proteins follow the two-state model of Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (the MWC theory) (57). These early X-ray studies demonstrated that the horse hemoglobin tetramer undergoes a large change in quaternary structure upon binding oxygen (7). Subsequent X-ray studies at higher resolution seemed to confirm these early results since they showed that both human and horse hemoglobin can adopt the same two stable quaternary structures, one associated with deoxyhemoglobin (the quaternary-T structure) and the other associated with liganded hemoglobin (the quaternary-R structure) (46, 58, 59). However, in 1991 Smith et al. (60) reported that a liganded mutant hemoglobin, carbonmonoxyhemoglobin Ypsilanti, adopts a quaternary structure (the quaternary-Y structure) that is different from the quaternary-R structure of liganded wild-type hemoglobin. The following year Silva et al. (61) found that wild-type carbonmonoxyhemoglobin can adopt a "non-R" quaternary structure and that this quaternary structure, the quaternaryR2 structure, was very similar to the quaternary-Y structure. Subsequently, Mueser et al. (47) showed that fully liganded hemoglobin can be crystallized in a range of quaternary structures, referred to as the Re ensemble, that is bounded by the quaternary-R and quaternary-R2 structures. Since the same dimer-dimer contacts are observed in all the Re ensemble structures, Mueser et al. suggested that "a continuum (or a nearly continuous set) of energetically accessible structures exists for fully liganded hemoglobin between the boundaries set by the quaternary-R and quaternary-R2 structures". This conjecture is supported by the elegant NMR studies of Lukin et al. (62) that demonstrated that the quaternary structure of liganded hemoglobin in solution is best represented by an ensemble of low-energy conformations with an average structure midway between the R and R2 conformations. Other crystallographic studies of R2-like structures (63, 64) and structures between R and R2 (65, 66) lend further support to the existence of an Re ensemble. The studies reported in this paper show that wild-type and mutant hemoglobins also can adopt a range of T-like quaternary structures, the THigh structures, when quaternary-T deoxyhemoglobin is expose to ligand in the crystalline state.

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 16, 2005 6115 Additionally, when mutations disrupt major quaternary constraints in the Trp37 cluster, THigh structures are crystallized in the deoxy form and therefore must be present in solution. The fact that a THigh structure has been crystallized from solution in the case of the cross-linked cyanomethemoglobin rHb1.1 demonstrates that fully liganded THigh structures also exist in solution. We refer to the collection of THigh structures as the Te ensemble. The transitions between quaternary-T deoxyhemoglobin and the THigh quaternary structures have two components, an interdimer rotation of the R1 1 dimer relative to the R2 2 dimer and a correlated intradimer bending motion of the R1 (or R2) subunit relative to the 1 (or 2) subunit. The magnitude of the intradimer bending motion associated with the T-to-THigh transitions varies between 0.5° and 3.9° and occurs about an axis that passes through the R1 1 interface. A very similar 4° intradimer bending motion, about the same rotation axis, is associated with the T-to-Re transitions. The interdimer rotation component of the T-to-THigh transitions is characterized by a set of screw-rotation axes, the T-to-Te screw-rotation axes, that are distributed over a narrow range. As shown in Figure 8, the range of T-to-THigh screwrotation axes is very different from the range of screwrotation axes that define the transitions between quaternary-T deoxyhemoglobin and the liganded structures of the Re ensemble. The T-to-Re screw-rotation axes pass through the "hinge region" of the R1 2 interface whereas the T-to-Te screw-rotation axes pass through the "switch region" of the R1 2 interface. The R direction angles of the T-to-Re screwrotation axes are distributed over a range of 33° that is bounded by the T-to-R and the T-to-R2 screw-rotation axes, whereas the R direction angles of the T-to-Te screw-rotation axes are distributed over a range of 20° that is bounded by the T-to- W37A and the T-to- H97A,IHP,4O2 screwrotation axes. ProgressiVe Loss of Dimer-Dimer Contacts in the Te Ensemble. Since all the structures of the Re ensemble are characterized by the same small set of dimer-dimer interface contacts, they are energetically similar and should be populated to more or less the same degree in solution (47). In contrast, the quaternary-T dimer-dimer contacts are progressively disrupted within the Te ensemble of structures as the magnitude of the screw-rotation angle Frot increases. This important feature of the Te ensemble is illustrated schematically in Figure 9 where the residues in contact across the dimer-dimer interface of wild-type deoxyhemoglobin and five representative Te structures are depicted. In this figure, the R1 2, R2 1, and R1R2 contacts are classified as polar interactions, typical nonpolar contacts, and general weak contacts (long contacts between 3.5 Å and 3.8 Å). For clarity, only one line is drawn between each pair of interacting residues and the water bridges are not shown. However, the total number of R1 2, R2 1, and R1R2 contacts, including water bridges, is tallied in Table 7. The deoxyhemoglobin dimer-dimer interface has a total of 23 polar interactions, 26 typical nonpolar contacts, 81 weak contacts, and 19 water bridges. As indicated in Figure 9a, these stabilizing interactions are distributed more or less uniformly across the length of the dimer-dimer interface. In the HbA,4O2,2.2 mM IHP structure, where ligation causes only a small (0.6°) rotation of the R1 2 and R2 1 dimers relative to each other, dimer-dimer contacts are beginning

[The hemoglobin tetramer is adapted from Figures 1.15 and 2.17 of Dickerson, R. E., and Geis, I. (1983) Hemoglobin: Structure, Function, EVolution, and Pathology, The Benjamin/Cummings Co., Inc., Menlo Park, CA.] The molecular dyad is the y-axis of the coordinate system and is drawn as a gray arrow through the center of the tetramer. The origin of the coordinate system is at the center of the hemoglobin tetramer, and the x-axis is in the plane of the page. The Re ensemble of transitions is bounded by the screw-rotation axes for the T-to-R (red arrow) and the T-to-R2 (purple arrow) transitions. The T-to-R screw-rotation axis is perpendicular to the dyad axis, has a y-intercept of 13.1 Å, and has an R direction angle of 16.5° (i.e., the screw-rotation axis makes an angle of 16.5° with the x-axis placing it slightly out of the plane of the page). The T-to-R2 screw-rotation axis is perpendicular to the dyad axis, has a y-intercept of 9.2 Å, and has an R direction angle of 45.3°. The Te ensemble of transitions is bounded by the screw-rotation axes for the T-to- H97A,4O2,2.2 mM IHP (green arrow) and the T-to- W37A (blue arrow) transitions. The T-to- H97A,4O2,2.2 mM IHP screwrotation axis is perpendicular to the dyad axis, has a y-intercept of -6.7 Å, and has an R direction angle of 126.0°. The T-to- W37A screw-rotation axis is perpendicular to the dyad axis, has a y-intercept of -17.7 Å, and has an R direction angle of 102.7°. The T-to-Te screw-rotation axes are approximately perpendicular to the plane of the page.

to be eliminated. Specifically, the small T-to-THigh transition between deoxyhemoglobin and HbA,4O2,2.2 mM IHP results in the loss of 4 polar contacts, 16 weak contacts, and one water bridge (Figure 9b and Table 7). Most of the contacts that are lost or weakened are located in the Trp37 1 and Trp37 2 clusters that are highlighted in pink and blue, respectively, in Figure 9. For example, the polar interaction between Asp94R2 and Trp37 1 in the Trp37 1 cluster of deoxyhemoglobin lengthens in the HbA,4O2,2.2 mM IHP structure and is classified as a nonpolar interaction. A much more dramatic loss of dimer-dimer contacts occurs as the screw-rotation angle, Frot, increases to 2.3° in the V33A,4O2,2.2 mM IHP structure. In this case, the larger T-to-THigh transition eliminates a total of 13 polar contacts, 6 nonpolar contacts, 28 weak contacts, and 9 water bridges. Most of the loss in dimer-dimer contacts occurs in the Trp37 1 and Trp37 2 clusters as well as in the region of salt bridges and polar contacts associated with Arg141R1 and Arg141R2 (highlighted in yellow in Figure 9). In contrast, the interactions stabilizing the switch region of the R1 2 and R2 1 interfaces are relatively unperturbed. In the structures where Frot is large (those in Figure 9d, Figure 9e, and Figure 9f where Frot varies from 4.3° to 8.6°), no subunit-subunit interactions (not even general weak contacts) remain associated with the Trp37 1 and Trp37 2 clusters or the R COOH-termini (Arg141R1 and Arr141R2). In contrast, even after a dimer-dimer rotation of 8.6° (i.e.,

the T-to-THigh rotation associated with the rHb1.1,Fe+34CN, 0 mM IHP structure), the polar interactions and water bridges stabilizing the switch regions of the R1 2 and R2 1 interfaces remain intact. The stereochemical basis for this difference is that the T-to-THigh screw-rotation axes pass through the switch regions (Figure 8). Consequently, even large T-to-THigh transitions fail to disrupt key features in the switch region that are diagnostic of the quaternary-T structure. That is, the salt bridge between Lys40R1 and His146 2 and the hydrogen bonds that Tyr42R1 and Asn97R1 make with Asp99 2 (and the symmetry related interactions at the R2 1 interface) are not disrupted, and the side chains of His97 1 and His97 2 remain positioned between the Thr41R2 and Pro44R2 side chains and the Thr41R1 and Pro44R1 side chains, respectively. It is interesting to note that in the liganded THigh structures the Fe-N 2His(F8) bond lengths in the R subunits do not shorten in response to oxygen binding until Frot exceeds 2.3° (Table 6). This coincides with the disruption of all the dimer-dimer interactions associated with the Trp37 1 and Trp37 2 clusters and the R COOH-termini. Ligand-Induced Tertiary Structure Changes Are SubunitSpecific. A detailed analysis of the ligand-induced tertiary structure changes associated with W37A has been presented in the Results section. Very similar ligand-induced tertiary structure changes occur in other liganded THigh structures where Frot is large, and smaller changes occur in the same

The complete dimer-dimer interface consists of R1 2 contacts (top half of each panel), the dyad-related R2 1 contacts (lower half of each panel), and the R1R2 contacts (center portion of each panel). There are no 1 2 contacts in any of these tetramers. Nonbonded interactions at the dimer-dimer interface are defined as follows; hydrogen bonds (red dashed lines) are defined as interactions of 3.2 Å or less between polar atoms, typical nonpolar interactions (thick green lines) are defined as interactions of 3.5 Å or less between nonpolar atoms or interactions 3.2 Å to 3.5 Å in length between polar atoms, and weak contacts (thin black lines) are defined as any interactions between 3.5 Å and 3.8 Å. The R2 1 contacts contributing to the Trp37 1 cluster and the R1 2 contributing to the Trp37 2 cluster are highlighted in pink and blue, respectively. The R1R2 dimer-dimer interactions are highlighted in yellow. For clarity, only one line is drawn between each pair of interacting residues and the water bridges are not shown.

aF rot is the magnitude of the interdimer screw-rotation angle relative to native wild-type deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy HbA). For columns 3 through 6, the number of noncovalent interactions is listed according to the subunit-subunit interfaces R1 2/R2 1/R1R2 followed by the total number of dimer-dimer contacts in parentheses. Polar contacts are defined as atomic interactions of less than 3.2 Å between a pair of polar atoms; typical nonpolar contacts are defined as atomic interactions of less than 3.5 Å between two nonpolar atoms or between a polar and a nonpolar atom; interactions of 3.2-3.5 Å between two polar atoms are counted as nonpolar contacts; water bridges are defined as [polar atom- - -water- - -polar atom] interactions where both water hydrogen bonds are less than 3.2 Å. All interactions between 3.5 and 3.8 Å are classified as weak contacts. For each type of interaction, a contact is counted only if each of the interacting atoms has a temperature factor of 50 Å2 or less.

regions in THigh structures where Frot is small. In general, within the Te ensemble, the R and subunits exhibit very different responses to the binding of ligand. When ligand binds to the R1 subunit, the heme Fe atom shifts toward the heme plane by 0.40 Å in the THigh structures, but the R1-heme group does not shift position relative to the R-globin. This movement of the iron pulls the proximal histidine (residue F8) toward the heme plane and forces an R-to- shift in the hydrogen bonding pattern of the COOH-terminal end of the R1 F-helix. The R-to- transition significantly expands the radius of the end of the

R1 F-helix, shifting the position of the Ala88R1 (residue F9) by 1.5 Å toward the side chain of Tyr140R1. In response, the side chain Tyr140R1 is forced into the space occupied by Trp37 2 disrupting critical quaternary constraints at the dimer-dimer interface. Thus the movement of the R1-heme Fe atom initiates an energy transduction pathway in which a small movement of the R1 Fe atom is leveraged into a much larger movement that is capable of disrupting quaternary constraints in the Trp37 2 cluster. In a similar way ligand binding to the R2-heme is linked to the disruption of quaternary constraints in the Trp37 1 cluster.

The T-to-THigh Transitions in Human Hemoglobin In the case of the subunits, ligand binding results in a smaller (0.2 Å) shift of the Fe atom toward the -heme plane in the THigh structures, but the -heme group shifts position significantly relative to the -globin and no change in the hydrogen bonding pattern at end of the F-helix takes place. In the absence of a change in the secondary structure of the F-helix, residue Cys93 (the counterpart to Ala88R) is not forced into the side chain of Tyr145 (the counterpart to Tyr140R) and dimer-dimer contacts involving the -COOH terminus and the -FG corner are not disrupted. Instead the movement of the -heme group initiates -subunit tertiary structure changes in residues in the CD-corner, the F-helix, the E-helix/EF-corner, and the FG-corner/G-helix that are in contact with the heme group. Since oxygen binding to W37E(RZn) (where only the subunits can bind oxygen) induces a large T-to-THigh transition (Table 3), this transition must be linked to the binding of oxygen at the heme groups. The analysis presented in Figure 2 suggests that the intradimer bending component of this transition can disrupt quaternary constraints in the Trp37 cluster. This suggests an energy transduction pathway in which ligandinduced 1-heme movement triggers tertiary changes in the 1 subunit that promote R1 1 dimer bending that disrupts quaternary constraints in the Trp37 2 cluster. Similarly, ligand binding to the 2 heme is linked to the disruption of quaternary constraints in the Trp37 1 cluster via tertiary structure changes in the 2 subunit and the bending of the R2 2 dimer. Ackers et al. (3) have reported that the binding of the first ligand to an R or subunit increases the ligand affinity of the unliganded subunit on the liganded dimer, but does not increase the ligand affinity of either subunit on the unliganded dimer. This positive intradimer cooperativity implies that some of the quaternary constraints disrupted by the binding of ligand to the R1 subunit must be the same as those disrupted by the binding of ligand to the 1 subunit and vice versa. The recent mutagenic screen of Noble et al. (14) has identified the major region of quaternary constraint to be a cluster of residues centered at Trp37 . Since the R and pathways described above link ligand binding to the R1 1 dimer with the Trp37 2 cluster and ligand binding to the R2 2 dimer with the Trp37 1 cluster, they suggest the following stereochemical basis for intradimer cooperativity. When the first ligand binds to the R1 subunit, quaternary constraints in the R1 2 interface are disrupted at the Trp37 2 cluster via the R transduction pathway. Likewise when the first ligand binds to the 1 subunit, quaternary constraints in the R1 2 interface are disrupted at the Trp37 2 cluster via the transduction pathway. Therefore, the binding of the first ligand to the R1 subunit (or the 1 subunit) will increase the ligand affinity of the 1 subunit (or the R1 subunit) because quaternary constraints at the Trp37 2 cluster common to both subunits have been disrupted. On the other hand, the binding of the first ligand to the R1 subunit (or the 1 subunit) will not increase the ligand affinity of the R2 or 2 subunits because quaternary constraints at the Trp37 1 have not been disrupted.
