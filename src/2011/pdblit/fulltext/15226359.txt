Peptide Translocation Experiments. Peptide translocation experiments were performed to assess the quantitative nature of tapasin expression on TAP-dependent peptide translocation (Fig. S1) and the degree of ICP47-mediated blockade of peptide transport (Fig. S2). The peptide translocation experiments were performed essentially as described previously (Ritz, U., F. Momburg, H. Pilch, C. Huber, M.J. Maeurer, and B. Seliger. 2001. Int. J. Oncol. 19:1211­1220). Briefly, the reporter peptides (RYWANATRSI and TNKTRIDGQY) were radiolabeled with 125I by the chloramine T method (Bailey, G.S. 1994. Methods Mol. Biol. 32:441­448). Cells 106) were permeabilized with 2U-activated strep(2.5 tolysin O (Sigma-Aldrich) in 50 l incubation buffer (130 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.3) and incubated for 15 Figure S1. Tapasin expression in 721.220 transfectants enhances TAPmin at 37 C before adding 10 mM ATP (Roche) and 0.5 dependent peptide translocation. 106 cpm of each radioiodinated reporter peptide. After incubation at 37 C for 20, 40, and 90 min, the cells were lysed in ice cold 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma-Aldrich) with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) for 30 min on ice. Glycosylated peptides were recovered with concanavalin A­sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) overnight. Precipitates were washed twice with 0.1% NP-40 in incubation buffer and once with incubation buffer. The radioactivity associated with the beads was measured by -counting. Quantitation of the Effect of Tapasin Transfection into 721.220 Transfectants on Peptide Translocation. TAP dependence was controlled by carrying out the assay in the presence and absence of ATP. Two independent experiments were conducted (Fig. S1). The data confirmed that the expression of tapasin led to a 3­8-fold enhancement in the TAP translocation of peptides by the 721.220.B*4402 and 721.220.B*4405 cell lines. We conclude that the enhanced TAP translocation of peptides in the 721.220.B*4405 cells expressing tapasin is one potential mechanism mediating the enhanced stability of B*4405 molecules.
The Degree of TAP Blockade of Peptide Translocation by ICP47 in C1R Transfectants. ICP47 expression was demonstrated to

reduce peptide translocation by between 60­80% (Fig. S2). We conclude that the remarkable differences in phenotype of these cells is as a result of the biochemical properties of the different class I allotypes and not due to differences in ICP47-mediated effects. Generation and Characterization of 721.220 Cells Cotransfected with HLA B*4405 and Soluble Human Tapasin Stable 721.220 transfectants expressing HLA B*4405 and soluble human tapasin were generated to examine for effects of tapasin on B*4405 transport kinetics and stability in the absence of TAP bridging (see Fig. 3 in main text). Expression of soluble human tapasin was confirmed by immunoblot with human tapasin-specific antisera (Fig. S3). Pulse­Chase Analysis of HLA B*4405 Maturation in ICP47 Transfectants C1R.B*4405 cell lines expressing ICP47 were pulse­ chase radiolabeled with 35S-Cys/Met, and the maturation of B*4405 molecules was compared in cells with or without ICP47 (Fig. S4). In ICP47-transfected cells, the majority of the nascent B*4405 were retained in the ER (Endo H sensitive), and maturation of B*4405 was not detectable,

Peptide translocation was allowed to proceed for 20, 40, and 90 min in the presence of ATP ( ) and 90 min in the absence of ATP ( ). ICP47 did not completely block peptide translocation in these lymphoblastoid cell lines.

probably because of the small percentage of the total B*4405 molecules that ever load with peptides and egress to the membrane ( 10%) during peptide starvation. We conclude that under peptide starvation empty B*4405 molecules, that comprise most of the nascent class I, are retained in the ER and eventually degraded. The exact retention mechanism is unclear but does not necessarily involve tapasin since calreticulin and calnexin are both capable of retaining immature proteins in the ER and are known to bind class I molecules (Carreno, B.M., J.C. Solheim, M. Harris, I. Stroynowski, J.M. Connolly, and T.H. Hansen. 1995. J. Immunol. 155:4726­4733).

Failure of B*4405 to Incorporate into TAP-associated Loading Complexes Using Metabolically Labeled 721.220 Transfectants We have performed a metabolic labeling of the 721.220.B*4405 and 721.220.B*4402 cell lines that express tapasin. We show that in the absence of tapasin there is no detectable radiolabeled class I reprecipitated with HC-10 mAb after elution from loading complexes ( TAP1 immunoprecipitates) by their dissociation with SDS (Fig. S5). In the presence of tapasin, endogenous HLA C coprecipitates with the loading complex. In B*4402 transfectants, there was 50% more class I protein eluted from TAP immunoprecipitates than in untransfected cells; however, in B*4405 transfectants there was no increase in TAP-associated class I proteins. This result was observed in more than one experiment and was also evident in C1R cells that express physiological levels of endogenous tapasin. Our data confirm, using very sensitive assays, that relative to HLA B*4402 very little HLA B*4405 class I protein can be captured in loading complex immunoprecipitates. Description of the B*4405 Structure The residues that surround the B*4405 F pocket are shown in Fig. 5 C in the main text. The P9 anchor residue phenylalanine projects into a hydrophobic F pocket where it is surrounded by the aromatic rings of Tyr 74, Tyr 116, Tyr123, and Trp 147, as well as making van der Waals contacts with Ile 95 and the aliphatic moiety of Asn77. The main chain of this COOH-terminal residue is tethered by H bonds to Asn77, Tyr84, and Thr143. The large cluster of aromatic residues within the F pocket provides a structural basis for the preference of phenylalanine at the P9 position. Tyr 116 forms the base of this pocket where the aromatic ring points away from the F pocket, such that the Tyr 116 O group points toward the P7 pocket, where it forms two hydrogen bonds with the Asp 114 carboxylate, a hydrogen bond to Arg 97 N , and additionally forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the backbone of the bound peptide (Phe 7N). The aromatic ring of Tyr 116 also packs against the long aliphatic side chain of Arg 97. The B*4405 structure superimposes very well over the B*4402 structure (root mean square [r.m.s] deviation of 0.24 Å over all C atoms). Upon superposing the 1 domain of the heavy chain only, the most significant differences in the C positions ( 0.5 Å) are concentrated within a stretch of the 1 helix (residues 70­76), and residue Gln 115, the residue

Figure S4. The majority of B*4402 and B*4405 molecules are retained in the ER of cells expressing ICP47, in which TAP translocation is highly attenuated, and therefore fail to acquire endoglycosidase H (Endo H) resistance.

adjacent to the polymorphic position. The result of this small but significant helical segmental shift is that the B*4405 antigen binding cleft is wider in comparison to the B*4402 cleft in the region adjacent to the P6-P8 position of the peptide. This localized heavy chain difference is also mirrored in the structural difference of the bound peptide, where positions Ala 6, Phe 7, and Ser 8 show the largest r.m.s deviation differences (0.5, 0.3, and 0.4Å, respectively [overall r.m.s for the entire peptide is 0.26Å]). Position 116 impacts on the P7 pocket, the architecture of which is also largely maintained between the B*4402 and B*4405 structures. In the B*4402 structure, Asp 116 is part of an intricate polar network involving Asp 114, Asp 156, Arg 97, and several conserved water molecules that additionally bridge contacts to the bound peptide (see Fig. 5 B in the main text). Asp 116 is orientated in the same direction of the aromatic ring of Tyr 116. A water molecule fills the "cavity" at position 116 of B*4402 such that it superposes closely to Tyr 116 O group and forms a similar role in that it bridges one hydrogen bond to Asp 114 (see Fig. 5 B in the main text). The Tyr 116 O group in the B*4405 structure forms additional H bonds, however, namely with Asp 114 and Tyr 74 and also forms direct van der Waals contacts with Arg 97, a residue that participates in P3 and P5 pockets (see Fig. 5 C in the main text). Although this direct Arg 97116 contact is lost in the B*4402 structure, the conformation of Arg 97

is strictly conserved. A comparison of B*4405 and B*4402 structures also reveals a widening of the cleft ( 0.5 Å) in the P6-P8 region, and the more extensive H bonding of 116 Tyr in the F pocket of B*4405 includes contacts with Asp 114, another residue known to affect tapasin dependence of class I molecules (11, 12). In addition, the contacts between Tyr 116 and Arg 97 can potentially influence the creation of the P3 and P5 pockets. Elution of HLA B*4405-associated Peptides in C1R Transfectants Peptides were eluted from C1R.B4405 and C1R.B*4402 and analyzed by mass spectrometry (see Fig. 4 in the main text). In addition to this analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDITOF MS), we performed Edman sequencing of the pooled peptide eluate; this data is shown in Table S2. The dominant peptide species from each Edman cycle was recorded as defined previously (Falk, K., O. Rötzschke, S. Stevanovic, G. Jung, and H.-G. Rammensee. 1991. Nature. 351: 290­296).

TAP-dependent behavior of B*4405 molecules in the T2 increase from neighboring cycles). The data represents cell line.

(C) The very low levels and Peptide Analysis of B*4405 expression are confirmed by specific lysis of peptide-pulsed T2.B*4405 transfectants by an EBV-specific HLA B44-restricted CTL Purification of HLA B*4405 was performed from 1010 clone CM4. C1R.B*4405 and C1R.B*4405.ICP47 cells grown in roller bottles, and peptides were recovered as described previously (Purcell, A.W. 2004. Methods Mol. Biol. 251:291­306). Peptides were separated by RP-HPLC using a SMART system HPLC (Amersham Biosciences) with a RPC C2/C18 column (2.1 mm [inside diameter] 10 cm). Eluted peptides were resolved from contaminating detergent polymers by using a rapid gradient from 0 to 60% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous TFA (12% change in buffer B/min, 200 l/min). This material was then subjected to MALDI-TOF MS, using an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) operated exclusively in the reflectron mode. Aliquots of each fraction (1­2 l or 1% of the fraction) were mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution ( -cyano4-hydroxycinnamic acid [10 mg/ml] in acetonitrile-ethanol 1:1 vol/vol), spotted uniformly onto a target, and dried for analysis. Replicate analysis and care with sample preparation can ensure high reproducibility and confidence in the differential analysis of class 1 ligands as described previously (Purcell, A.W., J.J. Gorman, M. Garcia-Peydro, A. Paradela, S.R. Burrows, G.H. Talbo, N. Laham, C.A. Peh, E.C. Reynolds, J.A. Lopez De Castro, et al. 2001. J. Immunol. 166:1016­1027). Comparison of material eluted from B*4405 molecules expressed by ICP47 transfectants and peptides recovered from wild-type C1R.B*4405 cells highlights the predictably poor (100-fold reduction in total ion signal) recovery of peptides from the ICP47 transfectants. This restricted the analysis of these peptides to MALDI-TOF MS mapping of peptide eluates and MS/MS analysis of selected species present in the C1R.B*4405.ICP47 eluate. The majority of species are shared in ICP47 and ICP47 cells expressing B*4405 (Fig. S6). We also demonstrated by MS/MS that the dominant endogenous peptide at 1089.5 atomic mass units found in wild-type cells was bound to B*4405 in both cell lines. This peptide is a natural high affinity ligand derived from the HLA-DP (DPA*0201) polypeptide chain (residues 46­54 EEFGRAFSF) and is a TAP-dependent ligand (Macdonald, W., D.S. Williams, C.S. Clements, J.J. Gorman, L. Kjer-Nielsen, A.G. Brooks, J. McCluskey, J. Rossjohn, and A.W. Purcell. 2002. FEBS Lett. 527:27­32;

Expression of HLA B*4405 in TAP-deficient T2 Cells and Characterization of Transfectants We transfected the B*4405 cDNA into the TAP-deficient cell line T2 and demonstrated a very low level of B*4405 expression on the cell surface of these cells compared with endogenous HLA-A2 that can load with TAP-independent peptides from signal sequences (Fig. S7, A and B). The low level of B*4405 was confirmed by the observation that these "empty" molecules were readily loaded with a synthetic peptide viral determinant to sensitize the cells for lysis by preformed CTL (Fig. S7 C). In addition, culture of cells at 26 C increased cell surface expression reflecting the stabilization of "empty" B*4405 molecules typical of TAP-dependent class I molecules. Together, we conclude that the source of B*4405-bound peptides in ICP47 transfectants represents the "drip feed" of translocated peptides that result from incomplete TAP blockade and that are preferentially captured by the relatively "chaperone-independent" B*4405 molecules.
