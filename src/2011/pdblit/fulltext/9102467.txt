Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) spectroscopy and a variety of computational techniques have been used to generate three-dimensional structures of the two DNA duplexes d(CGCCTAATCG) and d(CGTCACGCGC). The central six base-pairs in these two decamers contain all ten dinucleotide pairs in DNA and thus, represent a model system for investigating how the local structure of DNA varies with base sequence. Resonance assignments were made for the non-exchangeable base protons and most of the C-l/-C-4' sugar protons in both decamers. Three-dimensional structures were generated using a distance geometry algorithm and these initial structures were refined by optimizing the fit of back-calculated spectra against the experimental two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectra. This back-calculation procedure consists of calculating NOE cross relaxation rates for a given structure by solution of the Bloch equations, and directly accounts for spin diffusion effects. Use of this refinement procedure eliminates some assumptions that have been invoked when generating structures of DNA oligomers from n.m.r. data. Constrained energy minimization and constrained quenched molecular dynamics calculations were also performed on both decamers to help generate energetically favorable structures consistent with the experimental data. Analysis of the local conformational parameters of helical twist, helical rise, propeller twist, displacement and the ~1,/?, y, E and c backbone torsion angles in these structures shows that these parameters span a large range of values relative to the X-ray data of nucleic acids. However, the glycosidic and pseudorotation angles are quite well defined in these structures. The implications that these results have for determination of local structural variations of DNA in solution, such as those predicted by Callidine's rules, are discussed. Our results differ significantly from some previous studies on determining local conformations of nucleic acids and comparisons with these studies are made.

1. Introduction
Single-crystal X-ray studies of DNA oligomers have shown that the local conformation of the DNA varies with the base sequence (Wing et al., 1980; Drew et al., 1981; Wang et al., 1981; McCall et al., t Author to whom all correspondence should be addressed.

1986; Saenger, 1984; Dickerson et al., 1985; Dickerson, 1988; Hunter et al., 1989). Calladine (1982) proposed a correlation between these local structural variations and the base sequence., with these variations arising from minimization of purine-purine clash between adjacent base-pairs. Recent studies have shown that the local conformation can vary significantly for different crystalline forms of the same oligomer (Sakked et al., 1989; Jain 711

J. iWetxler et al. vative estimates for the initial precision of the input and these distance constraints distance constraints have only been modified in order to minimize differand ences between the volumes of the experimental 2D NOE cross peaks. This iterative calculated refinement procedure was performed on several sets a structure starting from standard of structures: Dn'A, a structure A-form starting from R-form DNA, and five structures generated by a DG algorithm. The local conformational parameters were then analyzed and our resubs are compa,red with previous n.m.r. studies of nucleic acid duplexes in solution.

& Sundarlingam, 1989), where the molecular packing and hydration are proposed to effect the local structure of the DNA duplex in the crystal. Since DNA shows such variations in X-ray studies, it is important to complement these'crystal strucstudies of DWAs in solution. tures with structural Present'ly available two-dimensional (2Dt) nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) spectroscopic techniques have made it possible to determine the threedimensional structure of biopolymers in solution (for a review, see Wiithrich, 1986). The independent of the X-ray crystal structure determination (Pflugrath et aZ., 1986) and solution (Kline et al., et al., 1989) structures of an 1986, 1988; Billeter a-amylase inhibitor protein has proven the ability of n.m.r. spectroscopy in determining the overall three-dimensional structures of small proteins. However, analogous studies for DNA duplexes are less easily interpreted since, in general, the questions concerning DNA structural variations within a much smaller atomic given helical family involve displacements, as compared to the kind of struetural problems that have to date been addressed by n.m.r. studies of proteins. It is important to realize that many of the sequence-dependent structural variations observed in DNA (Dickerson et al., 1985; Dickerson, 1988; Hunter et al., 1989) involve quite subtle changes in structure. Several groups have performed simulation studies to try and address how precisely DNA conformational parameters can be determined (Nilsson et al., 1986; Pardi et al., 1988; Gronenborn & Clore, 1989), and it is clear that the precision with which the structures can be determined depends upon the type and quality of the n.m.r. distance data. Recent studies using full relaxation matrix calculations (Borgias & James, 1988; Boelens et al., 1989) or analysis of the Bloch equations (Banks et al., shown that 1989; Madrid et al., 1989) have neglecting spin diffusion effects (Kalk & Berendsen, 1976) in 2D nuclear Overhauser effect' (NOE) data can lead to an inaccurate set of distance measurements. The use of full relaxation matrix or Bloch equation analysis allows refinement of structural models against the original experimental NOE data and thus leads to more accurate and precise distance constraints (Borgias & James, 1988; Boelens et al., 1989). Here, we have generated structures of the double-stranded DNA decamers d(CGCCTAATCG) and d(CGTCACGCGC) using an iterative refinement procedure consisting of a distance geometry (DG) algorithm combined with back-calculation of the 2D NOE spectra by solut,ion of the Bloch equations (Banks et al., 1989) and constrained molecular dynamics calculations.

The individual single strands for each DIVA decamer were mixed in equimolar amount,s with the concentrations estimated using extinction coefficients calculated from mono- and dinucleotides assuming only nearest-neighbor interactions (Fasman, 1979). The final concentrations for the n.m.r. samples were 25 ml< in double-stranded DPU'B for both decamers. The samples were prepared in aqueous 10 mn?-sodium phosphate. buffer containing 0.1 x-NaCi, 0.1 mM-sodium EDTA (pH 7.0). The n.m.r. samples were prepared by 2 cycles of lyophilization followed by dissolnt'ion of the sample in 99.8% (v/v) *H,O, a final lyophiiization and dissolution in 99.996% *H,O, before transfer t'o 5 mm n.m.r. t)ubes. jb) dll n.rn.r. experiments The n.m.r. experiments were carried out at 500 MHz on a Varian VXR-500s spectrometer with a sample temperature of 27( i@l)`C. The 2D n.m.r. data were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode with quadrature detection in both dimensions employing the hypercomplex method (Mueller C Ernst, 1979; States et al., 1982). Low-power continuous-wave irradiation was applied to the residual water signal during the 1.2 to 1.5 s recycle delay. The 2D data were collected in the following form: 2048 complex data points in t,; 350 to 400 complex free induction decays (FID)s in t,, 48 to 96 transients for each FID and with spectral widt,hs in both dimensions of 6000 Hz.

3 ms trim pulses surrounding an MLEV-16 composite pulse sequence (Bax & Davis, 1985). For decamer 1, 2D NOE spectra were acquired with mixing times of 1, 30; 60, 90, 120 and 200 ms and for decamer 2; the spectra were acquired with mixing times of 1, 30, 60, 90 and 120 ms. The n.m.r. data were transferred to a Sun 4/260 computer and processed with the FTNMR or FELIX programs (Hare Research, Inc.). The first complex points in both the t, and t, dimensions were appropriately scaled to eliminate ridge artifacts (Otting et al.. 1986). All 2D spectra were Fourier transformed into a 2048 x 2048 matrix by zero-filling, with both time domains in each data set multiplied by a 0 to 90" phase-shifted sine bell window function before Fourier transformation.

distance constraints

For the iterative back-calculation procedure 2 types of distance constraints were generated for the 1st round of refinement. For large (corresponding to distances of the order of 3.7 a (1 a = 0.1 nm) or less) well-resolved cross peaks; distances were estimated from the build-up rate of the NOE using the 2 spin approximation and assuming a single correlation time for all protons. Volume integrals were measured from the NOE data at all of the 5 or 6 mixing times for each decamer. The following equation was used to est'imate distances: rij = rc(~c/oij)1i6; where rij is an unknown distance, TV, is a known calibration distance; ~~~ and uc, are build-up rates for the unknown and calibration distances, respectively, which were estias a mated from the initial slope of the NOE intensities function of the fixing time. The distance between the thymine C-6 proton and C-5 methyl group (2.90 8) was used to calibrate distances involving a methyl group, and the distance between the cytosine C-5 and C-6 protons (2.45 .&) was used to calibrate all other proton-proton distances. The bounds for these initial distance constraints were set with an arbitrarily chosen precision of +@5 a to reduce the potential for obtaining inconsisan even more tencies between constraints. Although conservative constraint range could have been used, this range of f0.5 A was used as a compromise between the time required for the refinement and potential errors introduced by using too precisely defined distances. As will be seen, this precision for the distance constraints still leads to a wide range of structures consistent with the input data. For small cross peaks (where signal-to-noise limitations prevented useful analysis of the NOE buildup), for partially (or totally) overlapping cross peaks and for cross peaks whose volumes could not be accurately measured due to baseline variation in that particular spectral region, no attempt was made to quantify the NOE. Instead, the initial lower bound for the distance was set to the van der Waals' radii (1.8 8) and the initial upper bound set t'o 5.0 8. No distance constraints were initially added for completely overlapping cross peaks. (d) DG calculations The DG calculations (Crippen, 1981) were performed with the program DSPACE (Hare Research, Inc.) in a manner similar to that previously described (Hare et al., 1986; Pate1 et al.; 1987; Nerdal et al., 1988). In addition to the n.m.r.-derived distance constraints, the base-pairs were assumed to have standard Watson-Crick geometries with the imino N-H.. N and the amino N-H.. 0 hydrogen bonding distance constraints of 1.8 to 1.9 8. All information was entered in a distance the structural bounds matrix that was then smoothed by application of

For the iterative back-calculation refinement procedure the 2D NOE spectrum for a given structure was calculated using the FORTRAN programs BKCALC and GNOE kindly provided by Dr Dennis R. Hare (Hare Research, Inc.). The procedure for back-calculation has been described (Banks et al., 1989), and involves numerical integration of the Bloch equations, where the effects of spin diffusion are accounted for explicitly. These calculations require values for the cross relaxation scaling factor and the "2 leakage" rate. The cross relaxation scaling factor corresponds to a correlation time parameter and it was assumed to be constant for the whole molecule. The Z leakage rate accounts for the loss of all 2 magnetization during the mixing time for an individual spin, except for that arising from NOE cross relaxation, and thus corresponds to a T, type parameter. The 2 leakage rate was also assumed to be constant for the whole molecule. Batnks et al. (1989) give a more extensive discussion of these para,meters, and also describe the method that was used here for estimating values for these parameters. For each decamer, 3 sets of structures were used as starting points for structure refinement: standard rl-form DNA, standard B-form DNA and 5 structures previously generated with the program DSPACE. These 5 "initial DG structures" were generated with a precisely defined set of distance constraints ( f0.2 A or f0.3 8). These distances were generated using a Z-spin approximation and then fitting to the initial build-up rate of the NOE for 2D NOE spectra with mixing times of 60 and 100 ms for decamer 1 and 75 and 100 ms for decamer 2. The procedure used is similar to that previously described (Hare et al., 1986; Nerdal et al., 1988; Pardi et al., 1988): and the full details are given by Wang (1989). We would like to emphasize that our choice of starting structures is rather arbitrary. The primary criterion for the select-ion of starting structures is that they should lead to refined that sample all of the conformational space structures consistent with the experimental data. Thus, the fact that our initial DG structures were generated with high preciand, as discussed sion (+@2 A to @3 8) is not relevant below, the 7 defined structures are all consistent with our data while still having quite large conFormaexperimental tional variations. The back-calculation refinement proceeded in 2 stages using a procedure similar to that of Banks et al. ((1989). First, stack plots were compared to look for deviations between calculated and experimental spectra. The advantage of using stack plots for performing this analysis (as compared with contour plots), is that one is able to eliminate visually any problems resulting from baseline offset between 2 spectra and one can spot. easily where ridges in the spectrum may affect the true intensity of a cross peak. The stack plots of the back-calculated 2D NOE spectra for each decamer were compared with the experimental (120 ms or 200 ms) 2D NOE spectra to judge how well the model structure fit the experimental data. Because of the re6 dependence of the NOE, a small error in the distance between 2 protons in the model structure can manifest itself as a large change in the intensity of the cross peak for these 2 protons. Thus, extremely intense or missing cross peaks were ob'served

et ai. DNB decamer. These calculations were performed with the program IMPACT (Bassolino et al., 1988), using the all-atom force-field parameters described by Weiner et al. (1986) and employing the energy potential functions of bond stretching, bond angle bending, hindered rotation about a single bond, van der Waals' interactions. electrohydrogen bonding and distance static interactions, constraints of t,he form described by Bassolino et al. (1988). For each structure, 500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization were $e:formed. A distancedependent dielectric constant was used for the ,`electrostatic term, so no counter ions were included in the calculation. The non-bonded list was updated every 10 steps with a non-bonded cut'off of 7.5 A. The kOF, distance const,raint,s for the constrained energy minimizations consisted of constraints between the same pairs of protons as used in the back-calculation refinement. except that exact distances for each pair of protons were measured in each of the refined structures and were entered with a precision of f01 w. As will be discussed below, the reason for using these distance constraints was to ensure that the final energy-minimized structures fit well to the experimental I"\`OE data. The form of the potential used for the distance const,raints has been described by Bassolino et aZ. (1988), and a relative weighting factor of 10 was used for the distance constraint,s (for comparison, the weighting factor for a bond stretching term for a C-C single bond was around 200). Constrained quenched molecular dynamics was performed on the energy-minimized st,ructure in order to search for additional minima in the energy surface. The potentials used in the molecular dynamics calcuiations were the same as those used in the energy minimizat'ions. The structures were heated to 2500 K for 0% ps (0.5 fs/step) of constrained dynamics using both the 11'OE and hydrogen bonding distance constraints, t~hen cooled to 100 K for 1.0 ps of constrained dynamics with the XOE and hydrogen bonding distance constraints. A final 500 steps of constrained minimizations were performed with no hydrogen bonding distance constraints, but, instead included t'he standard hydrogen bonding potential discussed above.
(g) Calculation

commonly in the back-calculated 2D NOE spectra of the starting structures in the 1st round of refinement. All regions of the 2D NOE spectra for which t'he protons were assigned were analyzed, but the cross peaks involving methyl protons were not used in the iterative refinement procedure due to the known difference in correlation times for methyl groups. Distance constraint's were manually modified if there were significant differences in the intensities of a cross peak in the experimental and baek-calculated spectra. Additional constraints were added for assigned protons where cross peaks were observed in the back-calculated but not in the experimental spectra, and these are referred to as non-Pu'OE constraints. Refinement was considered complete when no significant change in the net difference (determined visually) in intensity between the back-calculated and experimental spectra was observed for several rounds of refinement. A total of 10 iterations were performed on each structure. It is important to note that our distance constraints were modified only when required to improve the fit between the calculated and the experimental spectra. This leads to the widest possible range between the lower and upper bounds of the distance constraints, while still fitting the experimental data. In no case was the range of a distance constraint ever reduced to less than @4 8. Tighter distance constraints were not used, even if there was a perfect fit between the experimental and the calculated cross peak volumes, because in the presence of spin diffusion there is more than 1 way of changing the size of a cross peak. For example, it is possible to change the volume of a cross peak by changing the distance between the 2 protons involved in the cross peak, or by changing the distance between a 3rd proton and 1 of the protons in the cross peaks. Such spin diffusion, or 3-spin, effects can lead to a variety of structures consistent with the volume of an individual cross peak. Therefore, a perfect fit for a cross peak volume does not imply a perfectly defined distance between the protons in this cross peak. The 2nd stage of each round of iterative refinement involved modification of our model structures to fit the new set of distance constraints. This was performed in the program DSPACE, where a new bounds-matrix was generated and then used to calculate the penalty function during refinement. Structures were "heated" using a simulated annealing-type algorithm (Hare et al., 1986; Nerdal et al., 1988) to allow them to sample conformational space consistent with the new distance constraints and then "cooled" with damped annealing. A final round of conjugate gra,dient minimization brought the structures into stable local minima. The new model structures generated with this procedure were then subjected to back-calculation to see how well they fit the experimental data. Separate back-calculation and refinement procedures were performed on each decamer for the A, B and 1 of the initial 5 DG structures. The remaining 4 DG structures were "carried along" in t,he refinement procedure using the new set of distance constraints generated from backcalculation of the 5th structure. The final 3 sets of structures will be referred to as refined A, refined B and refined DC structures, and correspond to the 10 rounds of iteratively refined structures starting from the standard A, standard B and initial DG structures, respectively.

The conformational parameters were calculated by the programs AHELTX (written by J. Rosenberg). and slightly modified versions of BROLL, CYLI9 and DTOR'AE (written by R. E. Dickerson). The definitions for the helical twist, helical rise, propeller twist, tilt,: roll; displacement (also known as dislocation; Saenger, 1984). backbone torsion angles and pseudorotat,ion angle have been described (Frantini et al.. 1982; Dickerson, 1983; Saenger, 1984). Since the sign for the displacement, roll; and possibly tilt, generat'ed by these programs varied with t,he absolut,e orientat'ion of the molecule, we will only report and analyze the magnitude of these parameters here. Some of the conformational parameters depend upon the definition of the helix axis of the DI$A and t,he best fit helical axis was calculated by the method of Rosenberg et al. (1976), using t*he co-ordinates of the C-l' atoms in each decamer. The helical twist corresponds in Dickerson's nomenclature, to the globa twist and is calculated from the C-l'%-1 vectors of successive basepairs. To calculate displacement, the long axes of the base-pairs (through the C-6-C-8 atoms) are projected into a normal plane of the best-fit helical axis. The displacement is calculated as the distance of the projected

C-6-C-8 vector from the best-fit axis. The definitions of tilt and roll correspond, in Dickerson's nomenclature; to @roll and o-tilt, and are calculated as the base-plane through both bases in the pair and are defined relative to the neighboring base-pair. It is important to realize that some of the helical parameters are defined relative to the helical axis and, therefore, depend on how this best-fit axis is determined for a curved helix. The pseudorotation angle was defined and calculated as described by Altona & Sundaralingam ( 1972).

3. Results (a) Proton
resonance assignments

Resonance assignment of the proton spectra of the DNA decamers were made by standard methods (Feigon et al., 1983; Hare et al., 1983; Scheek et al., 1984; Weiss et al., 1984; Wiithrich, 1986), and involved first the application of D&F-COSY and TOCSY spectra to group protons into individual spin systems on the aromatic bases or sugar rings. Intraresidue NOES were used to link an aromatic base with its sugar, and then interresidue sugar proton-base proton NOES were used to make 1986). In a rightsequential assignments (Wiithrich, handed double helix a C-6 or C-8 base proton generally shows NOES to the C-l', C-2' and C-2" protons of its own sugar ring as well as to the C-l', C-2' and/or C-2" protons on the 5' neighboring sugar (Wiithrich, 1986). Figure 1 shows part of a NOE diagram that was used to make connectivity sequential assignments for the C-6 or C-8 and C-l' protons in decamer 2. Similar connectivities were made for the C-6 or C-8 and C-2', C-2" and C-3' protons. This procedure led to the assignment of all the non-exchangeable base protons (except the adenosine C-2 base protons), all the C-l', C-2', C-2", C-3' protons and most of the C-4' protons of the sugar rings in both decamers. The C-2' and C-2" protons were differentiated by the different sizes for their C-l' proton intraresidue NOES and for their 3JHl,-tW coupling constants (data not shown; Wang, 1989). The adenosine C-2 protons were with the exchangeable imino assigned, along protons, by standard methods (data not shown; Wiithrich, 1986) with details given by Wang, (1989). The resonance assignments for the proton spectra of decamer 1 and decamer 2 are given in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. (b) Iterative back-calculation

Since three separate sets of back-calculations were performed for each decamer, Figures 3 and 4 show analogous plots of this region of the spectrum for both decamers for the A and B-structure refinements, respectively. The number and precision of the distance constraints increased in each round during thte ten rounds of iterative refinement.

Refinement of the standard A-form, standard B-form, and the initial DG structures were carried out by comparison of stacked plots of the experimental and back-calculated 2D NOE spectra as described in Materials and Methods. Figure 2(a) and stacked plots for the H-l'/H-3'(b) show H-8/H-B/H-2 region of the experimental 200 (or 120) millisecond 2D NOE spectra, and the calculated spectra for one of the initial and refined DG

The refined A, refined B and refined DG structures for decamers 1 and 2 were subjected to constrained energy minimization to improvje the energetics and covalent geometry of the structures. Table 4 gives the potential energies (in kcal/mol: 1 cal = 4.184 J) for the constrained energy minimized structures of both decamers. The conformations of the phosphate groups are very disordered in the refined DG structures and this situation did not significantly change upon constrained minimization (see below). Thus, we performed constrained

that while the r.m.s. deviations indicate that the refined B structure is very similar to all five refined DG structures for both decamers, the refined A structures have much larger r.m.s. deviations from either the refined DG or refined B structures in both decamers (approx. 3.0 A and 2.38 in decamers 1 and 2, respectively). The following local structural parameters were analyzed for the central six base-pairs in both Dn'A decamers: helical rise, helical twist, roll, tilt, propeller twist, displacement, glycosidic angle, CC, /I, y, 6, E, c torsion angles and the pseudorotation angle. Table 6 lists the average, standard deviation, and total range of values for each of these parameters (except for the a; /!J, y, E and [ torsion angles)

in the initial, refined, constrained energy minimization and quenched dynamics structures of decamer 1. The corresponding values of these parameters for decamer 2 are given in Table 7. The variations in these parameters in both decamers will be discussed below.

4. Discussion
In X-ray crystallography, structure refinement proceeds by minimizing the deviation of the calculated structure factors for a given structural model from the experimental structure factors, and usually incorporates information on the covalent geometry (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1981). The procedure for refining the solution structure of a molecule against the original 2D n.m.r. data is not as straightforward, since one needs to know the correlation times for individual proton pairs in order to calcu-

late accurate distances from the measured NOES. However, structure refinement methods have been developed for n.m.r. where, by assuming a single correlation time for the whole molecule, it is possible to calculate all proton-proton NOES. Using such a back-calculation (Banks et al., 1989; Madrid et al., 1989) or full-relaxation matrix analysis (Borgias & James, 1988; Boelens et al., 1989) it is possible to account directly for spin diffusion effects (Kalk &, Berendsen, 1976) in the molecule. Simulations by Borgias & James (1988) have shown that for short DNA oligomers (such as those used here), the errors introduced by the assumption of a single correlation time are generally much less than those produced by neglecting spin diffusion effects. Thus, by using a procedure that refines the structure against the original data we have much more confidence in the accuracy and precision of the final structures.

One goal of t,his study was to search for sequencespecific structural variations in DNA double helices, such as those observed in X-ray crystal structures (Wing et al., 1980; Drew et al., 1981; Wang et al., 1981; McCall et al., 1986; Saenger, 1984; Dickerson et al., 1985; Dickerson, 1988; Hunter et aZ.; 1989) and predicted by Calladine's rules (Calladine, 1982; Dickerson, 1983). The studies performed here were aimed at understanding how accurately and precisely t,he solution struct,ures of two DNA decamers could be determined by refining the structure against the original NOE data, and by inclusion of energy potential functions in the structure generation process. The central six base-pairs of the two decamers studied here contain all ten possible nearest-neighbor interactions in DNA and thus serve as a model for local structural variations with base sequence.

(a)

Structure rejinement using back-calculation of the 20 NOE spectra

The initial DG structures of both decamers were refined against the original 2D NOE data by the back-calculation procedure described in Materials and Methods. It is apparent from comparison of the calculated spectra with the experimental spectra (Figs 2 to 4) that none of the starting structures represents a close fit to the experimental data. However, iterative refinement of the structures yields calculated spectra that fit quite well to the n.m.r. data. The refinement was judged to have converged when the total deviations from one round of refinement to the next was essentially unchanged. At this stage the majority of the significant deviations were from cross peaks for protons on the ends of the decamers (data not shown). A possible

explanation of these deviations is that the assumption of a single static structure in solution :is not valid for the terminal base-pairs. This is consistent with the known fraying of the ends of DNA oligomers (Pardi et al., 1981; Bloomfield et al., 1974). Since the iterative refinement procedure involved separate distance constraints and back-calculation on only three of the seven structures (see Materials and Methods), it is important to see how well ah11 five fully refined DG structures fit to the original 2D NOE data. Figures 5 and 6 show stacked plots of the aromatic proton to C-2' and C-2" proton region of the experimental 2D NOE spectra for the refined A, refined B and five refined DG structures of decamers 1 and 2, respectively. Although there are some minor differences in cross peak volumes among the seven back-calculated spectra, these plots show that all seven structures give quite good fits to the

experimental data. As mentioned above, the terminal residues show much larger conformational variations than the interior residues, and the fits of the calculated and experimental spectra were often poorer for terminal residues. Thus, for the vast majority of the non-terminal cross peaks the variation of volumes among the seven structures is quite small. This becomes particularly obvious when one compares the variation in volumes obtained here with what is obtained if the standard structure refinement procedure were employed. For example, the average variation in volumes for cross peaks in the spectral region shown in Figures 5 and 6 (the refined DG, A and B structures) is only 17 O/Oand respectively. This is in contrast to what is lo%, obtained in the initial starting structures (which were generated by more standard methods where a high precision was used for the input distance

constraints and spin diffusion was neglected), where the average volume variations are 69 y. and 619;. respectively, for the same spectral regions. This shows that fits for the refined structures are much better than for the starting structures. Similar improvements in fits are found for the base proton-H-l', H-3' proton (Figs 2 to 4) and other regions of the 2D NOE spectrum (data not shown). To give some perspective to the magnitude of the observed variations in volumes among the seveln back-calculated structures, we will consider volume variations of DX'A structures generated using standard methods, that is, using a two-spin approximation and neglecting spin diffusion. Distance constraints in the standard methods are generally entered wit,h a precision of f0.2 to 0.4 a for distances less than 3.0 8.

correspond to a difference in volume of greate.r than 300%. Thus, with the standard methods, structures which perfectly satisfy the distance constraints could have very poor fits to the actual experirnental data; that is they would have very large volume

Thus, C(3) represents the base-pair C(3)-G(18); C4 represents the base-pair C(4)-G(17), etc. $ The average of the 5 DG structures are listed with their standard deviation. § The range is defined as the difference between the highest and lowest values of a given parameter in the set of 5 or 7 structures.

deviations. Furthermore, it is common to find dista.nces that violate the input distance constraint range by as much as 0.5 a (Wiithrich, 1986). Such a violation in the distance constraints could then lead to volume differences of greater than 650%. Therefore, it should be clear that the variation in the volumes of the spectra shown here are very small relative to those obtained by more standard methods. However, as will be discussed below, even with these good fits to the experimental data, our structures still show quite large variations in many local conformational parameters. Figure 7(a) and (b) show stereo views of the superposition of the central six base-pairs of the refined A, refined 3 and five refined DG structures of decamers 1 and 2, respectively. These structures were superimposed as the best fit of the C-8, C-6 and C-l' atoms of the central six base-pairs. It is clear that there is a significant amount of conformational variation among these structures. The variation is much larger than was observed in structures generated from simulated n.m.r. data (Pardi et al., 1988). Tables 6 and 7 show the conformational parameters for the refined DG structures of decamer 1 and 2, respectively. The average standard deviation and average range for almost all of these parameters increase in going from the initial DG structures to the refined DG structures (despite the fact that the variation in the volumes decreases). For example, in decamer 1 the average standard deviation and range

of helical twist in the five DG structures increases by 68 and loo%, respectively, in going from the initial DG structures to the refined DG structures. This result might seem surprising at first given the fact that the iterative refinement generates an improved fit of the calculated and experimental cross peak volumes. However, it is important to realize that the distance constraints for the initial DG structures were generated assuming a simple two-spin approximation and then entered assuming that the distance could be defined very precisely ( +@2 or f0.3 8; Wang, 1989). Thus, the larger variations in the conformational parameters for the refined structures simply reflect the fact that for the refined DG structures we have directly accounted for spin diffusion effects and have used a more conservative set of distance constraints than was employed in the initial DG structures.

The standard method for generating three-dimensional structures of biomolecules is to estimate proton-proton distance constraints from experimental NOE data and then use these constraints as that generate structures coninput for calculations sistent with these data (Wiithrich, 1986).

distances in a given structure and input distances are used to judge the goodness of fit. In the backcalculation procedure employed here, the optimization involves fitting the cross peak volumes of the experimental and calculated 2D NOE spectra. Thus, the distance constraints in this procedure only serve as a driving force for optimizing the fit of the experimental and calculated spectra. Because it is the volume that is being fit, and not the distance constraints, it is not relevant whether a particular distance constraint is satisfied as long as the calculated cross peak volume agrees well with the experimental cross peak volume. For this reason a comparison of the distance violations in the various generated structures, as is commonly done in the standard structure generation process, is not meaningful. Instead, comparisons should be made between the experimental and calculated spectra as shown in Figures 6 and 7. As will be discussed below, a potential improvement in the procedure used here would be to perform the refinement directly against the volumes (instead of distance constraints), and preliminary results of such a procedure have been reported (Boelens et al., 1989). For the constrained energy minimization and quenched molecular dynamics simulations performed here, the distance constraints play a more standard role. As discussed in Materials and Methods; these calculations employed optimization by fitting to a different set of input distance

As seen for decamer 1, in Figure 5(g) and (h) (and for decamer 2 in Fig. 6(g) and (h)), the constrained energy-.minimized and quenched dynamics structures still fit well to the experimental data, even though they were refined by optimization of distance constraints. (c) Relative energies of the decamer structures

Table 4 gives the total potential energies (in kcal/ mol) for the refined, constrained energy-minimized and constrained quenched dynamics structures for the A, B and DG refinements for both decamers. The refined structures have large total potential energies (> lo3 kcal/mol), with essentially all of this energy arising from the repulsive term in the Lennard-Jones potential. This effect is caused by slightly different templates (primarily bond lengths and bond angles) in the DSPACE and IMPACT programs, which leads to large energies for the r-l2 term in the Lennard-Jones potential. This high energy is eliminated in less than 50 cycles of mini-

it was observed that the two terminal base-pairs are subject to larger conformational variations than the internal base-pairs, and one sees quite abnormal geometries for the end base-pairs in Figure 8. Our previous simulation studies using an optimal n.m.r. data set also indicated that the terminal base-pairs could not be precisely and accurately defined (Pardi et al., 1988), and so here we only analyzed the central six base-pairs in both decamers. Table 6 gives complete data on the conformational parameters for the various structures of decamer 1, but the trends in these data are more readily seen in Figure 9(a) to (h), which shows plots of the variat,ion with base sequence for helical rise,

helical twist, magnitude of the roll, magnitude of the displacement, propeller twist, 6 torsion angle, glycosidic angle and pseudorotation angle, respectively, for the average of the constrained energyminimized A, B, and five DG structures of decamer 1. In addition the plots also show the range of values observed in these seven structures, as well as the total range for each parameter that has been observed in X-ray studies of double-stranded DNA (Saenger, 1984). We have chosen to analye,e the ranges for these structures, rather than the standard deviations since we are searching for all conformations consistent with the experimental data and there is no reason to assume that the ensemble of

DC structures of decamer 2, &owing an exampie of the phosphate conformations that are consist'ent with the

structures consistent with the data is a Gaussian distribution of the conformational parameters. Thus the standard deviation may not necessarily reflect the true distribution of the conformational parameters. However, this parameter is still given in Table 6 so that these results can be compared with previous studies. Figure 9 shows that the range of helical rise, helical twist and propeller twist that are consistent with back-calculation of the 2D NOE data and energetics of decamer 1, on average span approximately the whole range of values for these parameters t'hat have been observed in right-handed DNA double-strands (given by the broken horizontal lines in the Fig.). Thus, it is clear that using the data and methods discussed here, such as refinement against the original NOE data, these parameters ca'nnot be defined precisely for this decamer. Figure 9 and Table 6 show that' the displacement and the 6 torsion angle, can only be defined to, on average, no better than 50% of the range of values observed from X-ray studies of double-stranded DNAs, whereas the glycosidic angle and pseudorotation angle are quite well defined in these structures relative to the observed range in X-ray to not'e that we have somestudies. It is important what arbitrarily defined the "relative" precision with which a given parameter can be defined, by taking the ratio of the average deviation for each parameter in the refined st,ructures to the total range of values for this parameter that. have been observed in X-ray studies of double-stranded DNAs (for a more extensive discussion, see Pardi et al.,

1988). Thus, two para,meters that are defined with the same numerica. precision can have distinctly different classifications as to how well they are defined. For example, if bot,h the pseudorotation angle and 6 torsion angle have numerical precisions of approximately 45", their relative precisions are 15% versus 56%, respectively, due to a range of 300" for the pseudorot'ation angle but oniy 80" for the 6 torsion angle. Similar trends to those discussed above for decamer 1 are observed for decamer 2, as shown in Table 7 and Figure 10. Again this is most easily seen in Figure 10: where the range of helical twist, helical rise and propeller twist in constrained DG structures also span a large energy-minimized percentage of the range of values observed in double-st'randed DPL'A. (e) Constrained quendhed dynamics structures

As seen in Figure 8, and from analysis of t'he a, 3, y, E and [ backbone torsion angles (data not shown), the conformation of the phosphate groups are not well det'ermined in these decamers. This is expeet'ed from the results of computer simulat,ions of DNA using a set of distance constraints that mimic an optimal n.m.r. data set (Pardi et al., 1988). In both the structures generated here and in the simulations, the phosphate backbone appears t'o exist in local "pseudomirror image" geometries. The next step in the structure refinement, procedure was to perform const'rained quenched dynamics ealculations on both decamers to help search for the lowest

If a particular phosphate conformation is energetically much more favorable, then the observed disorder could be eliminated based on energetic criteria. Constrained quenched dynamics calculations were performed as described in Materials and Methods and, as shown in Table 5, the average r.m.s. deviations among the seven structures for each decamer are very similar to those for the constrained energyminimized structures. In addition, the energies for the dynamics structures are quite similar to the constrained minimized structures (see Table 4). Analysis of the range and standard deviations of the conformational parameters (Tables 6 and 7) also indicates that the constrained quenched dynamics procedure does not significantly improve the precision with which the local conformation of DNA can be determined from n.m.r. distance data. Since these calculations were performed to try to improve the precision of the phosphate backbone torsion angles, analysis of the seven constrained quenched dynamics structures for both decamer 1 and decamer 2 shows that these calculations do not lead to better determined conformations for the phosphate groups (data not shown).

et al constraint,s can be measured, so here; we generated a set of structures by refining against the original 2D NOE data, starting with a set of rather conservatively (relative to previous studies; Nilsson et al.; 1986; Happ et aZ.: 1988: Clore et al.: 1988) defined distance constraints. The only reason that the value and/or precision of a particular distance constraint was modified was to improve the fit, between the calculated and experimental 2D NOE data. Therefore, by using this iterative back-calculation refinement procedure we tried to avoid bias introduced by making an arbitrary assumption about the precision with which distance constraintSs can be measured. The next step was to include energy terms in the refinement procedure to produce energetically favorable structures that were consistent with the original n.m.r. data. We found that using n.m.r. distance data and the presently available computational techniques, the conformational parameters of helical twist, helical rise, propeller twist, roll, the a: /?, y, E and [ torsions angles and probably the tilt, 6 torsion angle and displacement, cannot be determined precisely enough to justify comparisons of loca'l structural variations with base sequence. In many cases: a parameter can only be defined with a precision t,hat is similar to the whole range of values that has ever been observed for this parameter in X-ray structures of right-handed DNA duplexes (ranging from A to n-form DNAs; Saenger, 1984). The structural analysis performed here, as well as, essentially, all n.m.r. structure determinations of DNA duplexes of which we are aware, assume that the DNA oligomer exists in a single static conformation in solution. However, it is more likely that the molecule actually exists in multiple conformations in solution, with rapid interconversion among the various conformations. Rorgias & James (1988) give an excellent discussion of the problems associated with determining the structure of a DN'_4 duplex where the individual sugar residues are in rapid equilibrium between S and N sugar puckers. As these authors point out, attempts to fit the NOE data to a population of exchanging conformations would only serve to add many more paramet'ers to an already underdetermined system, and therefore would lead to a decrease in precision wit.h which any given parameter could be defined. The end result of such an analysis would be that the DNA structures would be even more poorly defined than those given here. (h) Comparison QSthese decamer structures with previously determined n.m,.r. solution structures of DNA oligomers A number of workers have used 2D NOE data and computational techniques to generate detailed solution structures of DNA duplexes (for reviews, see Reid, 1987; Pate1 et al.; 1987; Van der Ven &, Hilbers, 1988). In some of these studies, the conclusions of how well local structures of DNA can be determined are quite different from those made here

constraints. This method has been used (Nilsson et al., 1986; Happ et al., 1988; Clore et al., 1988) to generate structures of DNA oligomers where the dynamics calculations were performed for much longer times (approx. 15 to 20 ps) compared to the 1.5 picoseconds used here. In order to test how the length of the dynamics calculations affect the generwe performed a series of ated structures, constrained quenched dynamics calculations on decamer 1 and 2 where the molecules were "heated" to 1500 K for eight picoseconds (with a step size of 0.5 fs), and then progressively cooled for 2.5 picoseconds each to 1000 K, 500 K and 100 K. The 100 K structures were then subjected to 500 cycles of constrained energy minimization. The "long" and final structures from this initial constrained dynamics calculation for decamer 1 are given in Figure 11 (a) and (b): respectively. The structure generated in the long quenched dynamics structure has a numb,er of features similar to A-form including' a large displacement (on geometry, average 3.7 A) and a small helical rise (approx. 2.9 A). The energy of this structure is 25% lower than the starting structure and the NOE violations are also slightly reduced. In addition, this structure still fits well to the experimental NOE data (data not shown), but has a significant r.m.s. deviation (approx. 4.0 A) from the energy-minimized or constrained quenched dynamics structures of decamer 2. Additional calculations with simulated data (data not shown) indicate that it is the energy potentials (most likely the electrostatic potential) and not the distance information that is driving the structures to this "A-like" geometry, and we are presently investigating the source of the forces that are driving the structures to t,his alternate conformation (W.J.M., R.M.L & A.P., unpublished results). However, for the purposes of the discussion here these results clearly show that longer constrained quenched dynamics can generate a nonB-type structure that is still consistent with the experimental data. These preliminary data indicate that the results presented here may actually underestimate the range of structures that are consistent with NOE data. (g) Limits on determining local structural variations of DNA in solution by n.m.r. data

We have performed computer simulations to determine how accurately and precisely local structural parameters can be determined from a set of proton-proton distances that mimic an optimal n.m.r. data set (i.e. a set of perfectly accurate and highly precise ( & 0.2 A) distance constraints; Pardi it was shown that et aZ., 1988). In this simulation, while the a, /3, y, E and 5 backbone torsion angles cannot be determined precisely from an optimal set of n.m.r. distance constraints, many other conformational parameters could .be defined precisely and accurately in the simulations. Unfort'unately, it is difficult to determine directly the accuracy and precision with which the experimental distance

and we will comment on possible explanations for these differences. Reid and co-workers have generated solution structures of a DNA oligomer containing the BclI restriction site (Banks et al., 1989), and one containing the EcoRI restriction site (Nerdal et al., 1989) using a procedure very similar to that performed here. In their studies a number of initial structures (8 for the BcZI restriction site) were generated by the DSPACE DG algorithm, but only one of these structures for each oligomer was then refined by minimizing deviations between the experimental NOES and NOES calculated from the model structure. These studies showed that use of the back-calculation refinement procedure enables one to generate a model structure which fits quite well to the NOE build-up rates. However, the fact that a particular model structure fits the experimental data well does not mean that this structure is unique, since it is possible that there are many different structures which fit well to the experimental data. Therefore, we chose to perform the back-calculation refinement procedure on all seven starting structures. The results here of our initial show that there are very large local structure variations in a set of structures all of which have calculated NOE spectra that are equally consistent with the experimental data for a single mixing time. Further studies will need to be done to see if refinement of a set of structures by fitting to the build-up of the NOE will lead to more precisely defined local conformation in DNA duplexes. Clore, Gronenborn and co-workers have performed a number of n.m.r. structural studies on DNA duplexes, and come to quite different conclusions as to how precisely and accurately local structural parameters can be determined from NOE distance data (Happ et al.; 1988; Clore et al., 1988, and references cited therein). These different conclusions appear to arise from different assumptions made by their group and ours in the procedures used for generating structures. The different assumptions include the following. (1) We have refined our structures against the experimental data using a procedure that accounts directly for spin diffusion; whereas their analysis assumed that spin diffusion does not affect the measured distances at the mixing times that they have used. (2) They have assumed a quite high precision (-02 to + 0.3 A for distances < 3 A and - 0.3 to + 64 A for distances between 3 and 5 A) for their input distance constraints, whereas we have initially used conservative distance relatively much more constraints (see Materials and Methods) and only modified the constraints when required to fit the experimental and back-calculated data. (3) In some of their recent studies they have included torsion angle constraints to help generate better defined structures. We will now address possible effects of these different assumptions. Several studies have shown that neglecting spin diffusion effects for molecules of the size studied here can lead to an inaccurate set of

distance constraints (Borgias & James, 1988; Boelens et al., 1989; Madrid et al., 1989). This is the reason why we adopted the back-calculation refinement procedure that accounts directly for spin diffusion effects. We have started from a relatively conservative set of distance constraints and,, as discussed previously, during the refinement we fit to the experimental 2D NOE spectra, where the distance constraints serve only as a driving force during the refinement. Gronenborn & Clore (1989) generated structures of a DNA duplex by varying the precision with which the input distance constraints were defined. Their results show that the variation of the structures is affected directly bv the precision of the input distance constraints. Thus, the differences between the work presented here and that of Clore and co-workers (Happ et al.; 1988; Clore et al., 1988 and references cited therein), concerning how well the local conformation ca.n be determined, is at least partially due to the effects of spin diffusion and different assumptions for the precision of the input' distance constraints. Another important difference in the work here and that of Clore and co-workers concerns their assumption of backbone torsion angle constraints. For example, in a recent study they have used the measured 3J18,s coupling constants for the s,ugar protons in a DNA duplex to constrain the 6 torsion angle to a range of 110 to 170" (Clore et al., 1'988). Although the addition of such coupling constant data is potentially valuable for improving the quality of nucleic acid structures, as seen in Figures 9 and 10 and Tables 6 and 7, the 6 torsion angle is already generally defined within this range by the refinement procedure performed here using :NOE distance data. Thus, the addition of this constraint will not significantly change the results presented here. Probably one of the crucial differences between these two studies arise because in :some recent studies (Gronenborn 85 Clore, 1989), but apparently not in earlier ones (Nilsson et al., .1986; have Happ et al., 1988), Clore and co-workers constrained the a, /?, y, E and 5 torsion angles tlo the rotamer conformations observed in standard A and B-form geometries. We have chosen not to make such an assumption since there is no experim,ental evidence to constrain these angles in solution. In fact, there is direct evidence from X-ray crystal studies that the phosphate backbone is variable 1989; Dickerson, 1988; Jain & (Sakked et al., Sundarlingam, 1989). For example, in the structure of a B-DNA dodecamer, Dickerson and co-workers found that the phsophate backbone existed in both a B, or B,, conformation, which arose from different rotamer conformations for the E and [ torsion angles (Dickerson et al., 1985; Dickerson, 1988): thus showing that there is no "standard" conformation for B-DNA. In addition, Westhof et al. (1986) observed that in a molecular dynamics refinement of a Z-DNA X-ray data set, the phosphate groups were rather disordered. Thus, even in the limited number of crystal structures of DNA duplexes presently available, there is variation in the rotamer

et a%. back-calculation refinement with eon&rained constrained quenched energy-minimized and molecular dynamics calculations, we have generated a set of seven energetically favorable structures consistent with the experimental 2D NOE dat'a, for two different DKA decamers. Analysis of these structures shows that the majorit,y of the local conformational parameters, such as helical twist, helical rise, propeller twist and backbone torsion angles cannot be defined precisely, using the n.m.r. data and computational procedure described here. Thus, from our data it is not possible to determine if sequence-dependent local structural varia,tions, such as those predicted by Callidine's rules: exist for DNA duplexes in solution. However, it is clear that the procedure described here can be used to determine more qualitative structural information such as syn or anti glycosidic angles, S or N sugar puckers, formation of Watson-Crick base-pairs etc. These data can be extremely useful in struct.ure determination of nucleic acids such as identification of hairpins (Van den Ven & Hilbers, 1988). triple-standard structures (Rajagopal & Feigon, 1989) or unusual conformations such as those found in telomeric DNA (Henderson et ab., 1987). Although the procedure described here is an improvement, over previous methods of structure generation because it refines the structures against original experimental data and directly the accounts for spin diffusion effects; there are a number of additional improvements which should A direct fitt'ing to lead to better defined structures. the experimental cross peak volumes would be desirable. Qptein and co-workers have described such an improvement involving refinement against t'he NOE relaxa'tion matrix (Boelens et al., 1989). It will be interesting to see how the precision of the structures changes using this procedure, as well as other procedures being developed which account for spin diffusion. Another important improvement would be the addition of homonuclear and heteronuclear coupling consta,nts for constraining t,he phosphate backbone torsion angles in nucleic acids.1H-31P coupling constant data would be belpful in defining these torsion angles. The 3JC.5,H.pl 3JcF5sjH, 3J,.,,, coupling consta,nt#s give inforand mation on the /3 and E torsion angles through Marplus-type relations. In addition, the 3Jc.,,Hmc-4pH homonuclear coupling constants and 3Jcm5rrH-c.4, angle. give information on the y torsion Unfortunately, there are no analogous coupling constants that can be used to give information on the CIand 5 torsion angles in nucleic acids. IIowever, it is clear that, the addition of coupling constant data will help constrain the backbone torsion angles in DP;A, which should then lead to better defined structures. Thus, there are a number of avenues which can be pursued to try to obtain better defined local conformations in nucleic acid duplexes. However, until structures are generated with these additional data, and appropriat,e simulat'ions and calibration studies have been performed, care should be taken in inter-

populations for the phosphate backbone and an assumption constraining the backbone torsion angles to a "standard" conformation is unwarranted. This assumption could certainly lead to some of the difference between the conclusions of Clore and co-workers and those presented here. We believe that this assumption can give quite misleading results since it will force the DNA duplex to have a regular backbone geometry even when there is no direct experimental evidence to support this conclusion. However, it may be possible to restrict the conformations of some backbone torsion angles by experimental measurements of homonuclear and heteronuclear coupling constants.

5. Conclusions
There has been some controversy as to how precisely and accurately the local conformational parameters of a nucleic acid duplex in solution can be determined from n.m.r. data. Different orkers have come to quite different conclusions as to whether sequence-dependent local structural variations, such as those predicted by Callidine's rules, can be observed in solution for nucleic acids (Clore et al., 1988; Happ et al., 1988). The results presented here indicate that these differences are a direct result of different assumptions made in the For example, structure generation procedure. Gronenborn & Clore (1989) state that using appropriate mixing times one can ignore spin diffusion effects and obtain accurate distances from NOE measurements with a precision of aproximately 10% for dist,ances up to approximately 4 A (which then leads to input distance constraints with precision of f0.2 to 0.4 A). Although it is theoretically possible to ignore spin diffusion by obtaining spectra at very short mixing times, it is extremely difficult to prove that spin diffusion is not contributing to the NOE cross peak intensities for any practically useful mixing time. In fact, Reid et al. (1989) presented data that indicated that there may be significant spin diffusion effects even at mixing times of 30 milliseconds. In addition a number of groups have shown that neglecting spin diffusion effects can lead to an inaccurate set of distance constraints for practically useful mixing times (Borgias & James, 1988; Boelens et al., 1989; Madrid et al., 1989; Clore & Gronenborn, 1989). An alternate procedure to obtaining data at shorter mixing times would be to eliminate the need for ignoring the effects of spin diffusion. Therefore, here we have used an improved structure generation process that directly accounts for spin diffusion by employing a back-calculation procedure involving fitting to the experimental 2D NOE spectra. The use of a backcalculation procedure, such as that performed here, will help to eliminate the controversy over the precision with which the input distance constraints can be defined from n.m.r. data because one can directly fit to the experimental cross peak volumes and need not fit to distance constraints.
