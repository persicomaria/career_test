ABSTRACT The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can grow in low oxygen, because it is capable of anaerobic respiration using nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor (denitrification). An intermediate of the denitrification pathway is nitric oxide, a compound that may become cytotoxic at high concentration. The intracellular levels of nitric oxide are tightly controlled by regulating the expression of the enzymes responsible for its synthesis and degradation (nitrite and nitric oxide reductases). In this article, we present the crystallographic structure of the wild-type dissimilative nitrate respiration regulator (DNR), a master regulator controlling expression of the denitrification machinery and a putative target for new therapeutic strategies. Comparison with other structures among the CRP-FNR class of regulators reveals that DNR has crystallized in a conformation that has never been observed before. In particular, the sensing domain of DNR has undergone a rotation of more than 508 with respect to the other structures. This suggests that DNR may undergo an unexpected and very large conformational rearrangement on activation.

INTRODUCTION Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an extensively investigated opportunistic pathogen that is able to colonize different environments and is responsible for a wide number of nosocomial infections1; among these, the most severe is certainly chronic lung infection of cystic fibrosis patients. Pseudomonal infections are life threatening. P. aeruginosa is a facultative aerobe, and thereby is able to stably colonize the thick mucous layer produced by the host's inflammatory response. Cells lying near the edge of the mucous layer rapidly deplete oxygen (O2) creating a gradient where O2 rapidly drop to low levels. Under these O2-depleted (microaerobic) conditions P. aeruginosa grows in thick biofilms probably using both microaerobic respiration and the denitrifying redox chain to supply energy by the stepwise reduction of nitrate (NO32) to nitrogen (N2).2­4 It is accepted that the ability to denitrify is also a component of pseudomonal resistance to nitric oxide (NO) produced by the host­defence system, and that biofilm formation is responsible for increased drug resistance.5 Given that according to recent work, NO and nitrite (NO22) are also crucial players in the regulation of both denitrification6 and biofilm formation,7,8 it becomes mandatory to unveil the role of these molecules during the various stages of infection to propose new therapeutic strategies. In P. aeruginosa the expression of the denitrification machinery is controlled by ANR (anaerobic regulator of arginine deaminase and nitrate reduction), a global O2 sensor that at low p(O2), activates different anaerobic pathways and induces the expression of the key transcription factor DNR (dissimilative nitrate respiration regulator).9 DNR is required for the N-oxides-dependent transcriptional activation of genes involved in the denitrification pathway.10 To date, a description at molecular level of the mechanism that controls DNR activation is still missing. Both ANR and DNR belong to the CRP-FNR superfamily of transcription factors.11 These regulators, structurally related to CRP (cyclic AMP receptor protein)12 and FNR (fumarate and nitrate reduction regulator)13 from Escherichia coli, are homodimers, each monomer conAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article. ´ Grant sponsor: Ministero della Universita e della Ricerca of Italy; Grant numbers: RBIN04PWN_000; RBIN04PWN_002; 20074TJ3ZB_005; RBLA03B3KC_004 (crystallization robot). ` *Correspondence to: Francesca Cutruzzola, Department of Biochemical Sciences ``A.

sisting of three distinct domains: (i) a sensing domain (N-terminal); (ii) a dimerization a-helix; and (iii) a DNA binding domain (C-terminal), as shown in Figure 1(C) for CRP. The CRP-FNR regulators control many enzymatic pathways and respond to a large number of signals such as cAMP, anoxia, the redox state, oxidative and nitrosative stress, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, 2-oxoglutarate, or temperature.11 Ligand binding triggers the conformational changes from an OFF conformation (unable to bind DNA) to an ON conformation (able to bind DNA). While ANR is an O2 sensor containing an iron-sulfur cluster,14 it is yet unknown how DNR responds to NO or other N-oxides. We have recently solved the 3D structure of DNRN152stop (DCDNR) a C-terminal deletion mutant of DNR lacking the DNA binding domain and have shown that this truncated protein (152 a.a.) as well as the wild-

type (wt)DNR (227 a.a.), are able to bind protoheme in vitro with a 1:1 stoichiometry.15 In this article, we present the 3D crystallographic structure of the wtDNR. A structural comparison with both DCDNR and CRP suggests that, among the CRP-FNR type of regulators, DNR activation may be controlled by a novel activation mechanism. METHODS
Protein cloning, expression, and purification

Cloning and heterologous expression of the dnr gene is described in Ref. 15 except that in the present article5, cells were grown at 208C instead of 258C. wtDNR was purified according to the same protocol used for the mutant DNR-N152stop described in the same article.

Crystallization and data collection

Structure determination and refinement

After screening a wide rage of conditions with a crystallization robot (PHOENIX; Art Robbins Instruments), crystals of native DNR were obtained by sitting drop vapor diffusion method mixing 1 lL of protein solution (5 mg/mL in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM TRIS pH 7.2 buffer) with 1 lL of the 500 lL reservoir solution--20% (w/v) PEG3350, 0.2M ammonium tartrate. Crystal grew in 2 to 3 days as very thin plates. Before freezing in liquid nitrogen crystals were soaked into a solution of mother liquor and 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Data were collected at 100 K at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) (ID23-1), Grenoble (France). ° The best crystal diffracted weakly to 3.6 A resolution and belongs to space group C2. Data collection strategy was calculated with BEST.16 Data were integrated using MOSFLM17 and, due to radiation damage, only the first 220 frames (1548) were scaled with SCALA.18 The asymmetric unit (AU) consists of 10 monomers (five noncrystallographic dimers). See Table I for complete data collection statistics.

Phases were obtained by molecular replacement method with PHASER19 in the CCP4 suite.20 Only the b-barrel core of the N-terminal domain of DNRN152stop (DCDNR) (pdb id: 2z69) was used as a search model. The final MR solution consisted of six of the 10 monomers (five dimers) in the AU. The missing molecules and the dimerization helices were placed manually where electron density from the 2Fo2Fc map (contoured at 1.5r) together with positive electron density from the Fo2Fc map (contoured at 3.5r) became visible as the model improved. Finally, positive electron density belonging to the helices of the helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif became visible and it was possible to fit a model of the C-terminal DNA-binding domain obtained with MODELLER,21 thus obtaining the final 10 molecules in the AU. Building and refinement was iteratively carried out using COOT22 and REFMAC5.23 All data from 100.0 to ° 3.6 A resolution were included in the refinement. During refinement the geometric parameters were restrained and structure idealization steps were alternated with model building. To avoid over-refinement and model bias a polyalanine model was iteratively produced from the working model and side chains were added only in the positive Fo2Fc electron density map obtained from the polyalanine model. Despite the presence of five dimers, no NCS averaging could be used because of the differences among the monomers, and each of the 10 monomers had to be inspected carefully after every refinement round. Refinement process was stopped when no substantial improvement in maps quality could be observed. Only conventional rotamers were used both for visible and nonvisible side chains. Nonvisible atoms were included in the final model with zero occupancy. The final model consists of 2145 residues. The geometrical quality of the model was assessed using PROCHECK.24,25 Final statistics are reported in Table I. The coordinates and the structure factors of DNR have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession code 3dkw.

The movie shows qualitatively the entity of the hypothetical conformational change needed for DNR activation. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Crystal structure of wtDNR

The structure of wtDNR was solved by molecular ° replacement at 3.6 A resolution. The protein crystallized as a homodimer in the apo form. The 3D structure is shown in Figure 1(A) together with the secondary structure organization [Fig. 1(B)]. As expected, the monomer fold of DNR is similar to that of the other transcription factors of the CRP-FNR superfamily. In particular (i) the sensing domain (N-terminal; residues 1­123) is formed by a b-barrel core (b-sheets 1­8) and three a-helices (a-helix A­C); (ii) a-helix D (residues 124­152) is the dimerization helix; and (iii) the DNA binding domain (C-terminal; residues 153­227) is constituted by three a-helices (a-helix E to G) and two b-sheets (b-9 and 10), where a­G is the recognition helix of the HTH motif responsible for DNA binding.
Comparison of wtDNR with DCDNR

Comparing the structure of wtDNR with the C-terminal deletion mutant of the regulator, DCDNR,15 a striking difference immediately appears. After superposition of the dimerization helices of the two structures, it is evident that the sensing domain of wtDNR is rotated by 668 with respect to the same domain in DCDNR [Fig. 2(A)]. It is important to note that in the known structures of CRP-FNR regulators, the scaffold of the sensing domain is structurally conserved, although the sequence identity is often lesser than 25%. Thus, for this class of regulators, we can consider the entire sensing domain as a rigid body (as a first approximation). In particular, in the case of wtDNR and DCDNR which share the same sequence, the two sensing domains are similar and superpose with ° a Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of 0.75 A (Ca). Clearly, the difference between the two structures is not due to differences in the overall fold but due to the peculiar orientation of the sensing domains with respect to the dimerization helix D, which is dramatically different for the two proteins.
Comparison of wtDNR with CRP: ON and OFF conformations

homologue of DNR whose structure has been solved in complex with DNA; thus, it is considered the paradigm for the ON conformation. On the contrary, when this class of regulators is inactive or in the OFF conformation, the DNA binding domain of each monomer can change its orientation dramatically by rotating around the dimerization helix.28­30 As a consequence, the region connecting the two domains is called the hinge [connection between a-helix D and a-helix E; Fig. 1(A,B)].31 The comparison between DNR and CRP reveals that wtDNR has crystallized in an OFF conformation. Interestingly, both DNA binding domains of the wtDNR dimer are rotated by 1558 with respect to the ON conformation of CRP [Fig. 2(B)], with a-helix E being now an extension of a-helix D. This yields a single long helix composed by a-helix D and a-helix E on the same axis [Fig. 1(A,B)]. In this fully OFF conformation of wtDNR, the recognition helices of the HTH motif are oriented downward looking at the sensing domain [Fig. 1(A)], a topology that would not be effective in binding DNA. The fully OFF conformation of the DNA binding domain has been already observed for two DNR homologues CprK from Desulfitobacterium hafniense30 and CooA from Rhodospirillum rubrum28 (see below for a detailed comparison). The novel and unexpected feature in the wtDNR structure is the position of the sensing domain. In particular, the fully OFF wtDNR conformation results in a rotation of the two monomers that twist around the two long helices [dimerization helix-D plus a-helix E, see top view Fig. 1(A)]. This twist affects the overall position of the sensing domain that, in wtDNR, is different not only from DCDNR but, as we will see, from all the other known structures. By comparison with CRP, the sensing domain of wtDNR is rotated by 558, as shown in Figure 2(A). Superposition of the sensing domain of ° the two structures (Ca) results in an RMSD of 2.08 A (sequence identity of 23.6%); thus once again we can consider the b-barrel core (b-sheets 1­8) of these structures as a rigid body. We will now focus on the position of the flap in the sensing domain [b-hairpin composed by bsheets 4 and 5; Fig. 1(A,B)]. The flap is an important structural element of the CRP-FNR class of regulators, that interacts with the DNA binding domain in the ON ° conformation.32 In wtDNR the flap is more than 20 A away from its position in a hypothetical ON conformation as derived from the CRP structure [Fig. 2(B)].
Comparison of wtDNR with CooA and CprK: position of the sensing domain

To bind DNA, the CRP-FNR transcription factors must be in an active or ON conformation, as shown in Figure 1(C) for CRP from E. coli which, after activation by two molecules of cAMP, binds DNA.27 Once the regulator is activated (ON conformation) the two recognition helices of the HTH motif are in the correct position to bind the cognate DNA sequence by interaction with the major groove [Fig. 1(C)]. CRP is the first structural

CooA28,33 is a CRP-FNR regulator activated by carbon monoxide (CO) binding to the heme cofactor. The position of the DNA binding domain in the OFF conformation28 of the protein is similar to the fully OFF wtDNR, except for a 108 angle between a-helix E and

the OFF conformation and ON conformation (protein: ligand:DNA complex).30 Again the major difference with wtDNR structure is the position of the sensing domain, which is almost invariant in both CprK inactive and active conformations, while results rotated, with respect to wtDNR, by 498 and 548, respectively [Fig. 2(D)]. The fully OFF structure of wtDNR is therefore peculiar with respect to the other OFF structures known for this class of regulators, which all display a different orientation of the DNA binding domain around the hinge zone, while the position of the sensing domain is invariant.28­30 We can hence regard the wtDNR fully OFF structure as a new and atypical quaternary structure among the CRPFNR superfamily of transcription factors, since none of the other DNR structural homologues displays such a peculiar domain organization.
Hypothesis on DNR activation mechanism

ing the spectroscopic and kinetic properties of the wtDNR­heme complex,15 we are keen to think that DNR could be one member of a growing group of socalled heme-responsive/sensing proteins, identified in recent years, which are noncanonical heme binding proteins that respond to heme association/dissociation.35,36 In fact the DCDNR structure, which in this scenario should mimic the ON conformation of the sensing domain, displays a hydrophobic cleft that could be the putative heme binding site; this cleft is absent in the wtDNR fully OFF structure due to the remarkable rotation of 668 of the sensing domain [Fig. 2(A)]. Since from the structural analysis wtDNR seems to be an extremely flexible protein (flexibility that may account for the extreme difficulty to obtain well diffracting crystals), we think that apoDNR should be able to undergo a ligand-linked large conformational rearrangement necessary to switch to the active conformation. In summary our hypothesis, which needs further experimental support, is that wtDNR activation may be driven initially by heme association, that promotes a first conformational rearrangement from the fully OFF toward a pseudoON conformation (represented by DCDNR), followed by NO binding to the heme with final conversion to the biologically active state of the protein.

PROTEINS

Since both CooA (protein:ligand complex)33 and CprK (protein:ligand:DNA complex)30 display an active conformation which is similar to CRP (superposition of Ca: ° ° RMSD 2.28 A and 3.09 A, respectively), we can expect the active form of DNR to share the same topology. Thus the fully OFF conformation reported here suggests that to be able to bind DNA, wtDNR is likely to undergo a huge conformational change involving (i) a rotation of almost 1608 of the C-terminal DNA binding domain around the hinge, and (ii) a concomitant rotation of more than 608 of the whole sensing domain around the junction between this domain and the dimerization helix a-D (see movie in supplementary materials). Within this scenario, it is challenging to unveil the mechanism that drives such a dramatic conformational change, apparently controlling DNR activation. All the characterized CRP-FNR regulators are activated by binding of small molecules to the sensing domain, which may contain cofactors such as iron­sulfur clusters or heme. Although the activation mechanism is still poorly understood, it is accepted that ligand binding to the sensing domain induces a conformational change, which is transferred through the dimerization helix and the flap to the DNA binding domain.31,34 In this activation mechanism, the overall position of the sensing domain is not supposed to change during the switch from the OFF to the ON conformation. Given the fully OFF crystal structure of wtDNR reported in this study, the activation mechanism for DNR seems to be different, and probably more complex, since the ligand association event should trigger a much larger conformational rearrangement. We have recently shown that both wtDNR and DCDNR bind in vitro one Fe(III)protoporphyrin-IX complex (hemin) per monomer with high affinity.15 However, despite extensive attempts, we could not obtain crystals of the heme­protein complex.
