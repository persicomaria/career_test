One of the most effective strategies recommended to delay insect resistance to Bt-plants is concurrent expression of several toxins in the same plant. A new generation of Bt-cotton, including Bollgard II and WideStrike, has been developed to simultaneously express two different Cry toxins, Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab, and Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa, respectively. The aim of this study was to determine the individual and combined toxic effect of Cry1Ac, Cry2Ab, and Cry1Fa in the cotton pests Helicoverpa armigera and Earias insulana, as well as the nature of the interactions between these toxins, as determined by mean lethal concentration (LC50) values and larval growth inhibition studies. Singly, all three assayed toxins were more toxic against E. insulana than against H. armigera larvae. Toxin Cry1Ac was significantly more toxic than the other two on H. armigera, while toxin Cry1Fa was the least toxic and caused no significant mortality. When combined, Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa showed an additive interaction in all proportions analyzed for both pest species, whereas Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab interacted synergistically in mixtures comprising 1:1 or 1:4 of each toxin against H. armigera. In E. insulana, there was no synergism between Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab but both these toxins showed a high insecticidal activity when administered individually and in mixtures. This study suggest that each particular toxin or toxin combination expressed in transgenic Bt-cotton should be carefully selected depending on the most important pest species present in each geographical area.

1. Introduction The advance of biotechnology has allowed the development of insect-resistant transgenic plants expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cry genes. Bt-plants now include several major crops including maize and cotton (Schnepf et al., 1998). The first generation of Btcotton, known as Bollgard I or Ingard (Monsanto Co., St. Lois, MO), expressed toxin Cry1Ac, and provided effective control against important cotton pests from North America, such as Heliothis virescens (Fabricius) and Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) and a moderate control against Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Halcomb et al., 1996; MacIntosh et al., 1990). In Australia, it offered protection against H. armigera (Hübner) and H. punctigera (Wallengren), for much of the growing season (Fitt, 2004). However, the widespread use of Bt-plants poses strong selection pressure that can accelerate the development of insect resistance and limit the long-term use of this technology and of all other Bt-based bioinsecticides. One of the most effective strategies to delay the development of insect resistance to Bt-plants is the simultaneous expression of

several toxins in the same plant, known as gene pyramiding (Roush, 1998). A second generation of Bt cotton simultaneously expressing two different Cry toxins has been developed recently. Bollgard II (Monsanto Co., St. Lois, MO) produces toxins Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab, WideStrike Insect Protection (Dow Agroscience, Indianapolis, IN) expresses toxin Cry1Fa in combination with Cry1Ac, and VipCot, which expresses Cry1Ab and Vip3A (Syngenta Biotechnology, Research Triangle Park, NC). Other Bt cotton varieties include different combinations of Bt toxins, such as a hybrid Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac. Lepidopteran species such as H. armigera and Earias insulana (Boisduval) constitute some of the most serious pests in cotton crops in many countries of southern Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia (Fitt, 1989; Reed, 1994). Several countries in these regions have introduced Bollgard II and this variety is now grown over a wide area in Australia, India, and South Africa. The expression of multiple toxins in a single plant is likely to result in interactions between toxins in the target insect that might result in an increase or decrease in the degree of pest control. Synergistic interactions between Bt toxins were described first between Cry and Cyt toxins of B. thuringiensis serovar israelensis in dipterans (Bravo et al., 2007). Subsequently, both synergistic and antagonistic interactions between Bt toxins have been observed in lepidopterans (Del Rincón-Castro et al., 1999; Lee et al., 1996;

Sayyed et al., 2001). In H. armigera, synergistic interactions have been observed between toxins Cry1Aa and Cry1C (Xue et al., 2005), or Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa (Chakrabarti et al., 1998), whereas toxins Cry1Ac and Cry2Aa appeared to interact antagonistically (Liao et al., 2002). No interactions between Cry toxins have been reported in Earias spp. The aim of this study was to determine the individual toxic effect of Cry1Ac, Cry2Ab, and Cry1Fa toxins on the cotton pests H. armigera and E. insulana, and the nature of the interactions between these toxins (synergistic, antagonistic or additive), as determined by concentration­mortality responses and larval growth inhibition studies.

was carried out with trypsin type I from bovine pancreas (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in a proportion of 0.1 mg trypsin per mg protoxin. The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with constant shaking and the completion of the reaction was checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS­PAGE). Trypsin activated Cry proteins were purified by anion-exchange chromatography with the MonoQ HR5/5 column by fast-protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Protein concentration was determined by densitometry on a UV transiluminator using the Chemi Doc E.Q. program (BioRad, Hercules, CA) including bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Insects Two colonies of E. insulana and one colony of H. armigera were used in this study. One of the colonies of E. insulana was established in Spain from pupae obtained from a continuous laboratory culture maintained since 2001 in the Plant Protection Institute, Giza, Egypt. A second colony was started with field collected larvae from cotton fields in Córdoba, Spain, during the summer of 2005. The H. armigera colony was established in Spain from pupae supplied by Prof. Robert Possee (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Oxford, U.K.). These colonies were continuously maintained in our laboratory in a growth chamber at 27 ± 1 °C, 60% RH, and a photoperiod of 14:10 h (L:D) using an artificial diet (Greene et al., 1976). 2.2. Bacillus thuringiensis strains Cry1Ac4 (EG11070), Cry1Fa1 (EG11069) and Cry2Ab2 (EG7699) toxins were produced in recombinant B. thuringiensis strains (name given in parenthesis), expressing just one type of Cry protein. Strains EG11070 and EG11069 were obtained from Ecogen Inc. (Langhorne, PA) and the EG7699 strain from Monsanto Co. (Chesterfield, MO) by way of Prof. J. Ferré (Departamento de Genética. Universidad de Valencia, Spain). 2.3. Production of Cry toxins The recombinant strains were initially grown for 48 h at 28 °C on in CCY-agar medium plates, for sporulation, supplemented with 3 lg/ml chloramphenicol. One colony was removed and resuspended in sterile double-distilled water and incubated for 30 min at 70 °C to synchronize spore germination. Spores were cultured in CCY (casein hydrolysate/yeast-containing medium) containing 3 lg/ml chloramphenicol, at 28 °C and constant shaking during 48 h. When most cells had lysed, 1 M NaCl was added to inhibit protease activity. Cultures were centrifuged in a fixed angle rotor for 15 min at 9000g at 4 °C and the pellets were suspended in double-distilled water and centrifuged twice more. Mixtures of spores and crystals were completely disaggregated by sonication on ice for 30 s. Crystals were separated from spores by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, as described by Luthe (1983). Solutions of 79% and 67% (w/v) sucrose were prepared in double-distilled water and then placed in a 38.5 ml centrifuge tube. A 10 ml volume was carefully layered onto the sucrose gradient and centrifuged for 16 h at 70,000g at 4 °C. The crystalcontaining band was collected, washed three times with double-distilled water at 12,000g for 15 min and 4 °C. The purified crystals were solubilized by gentle agitation in a solution of 50 mM Na2CO3 pH 11.3 and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), for 2 h at room temperature. Unsolubilized crystals were removed by centrifugation at 9000g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein activation

2.4. Toxicity bioassays The toxicity of individual and mixtures of Cry toxins against H. armigera and E. insulana was assessed by concentration­mortality assays and larval growth inhibition studies. Mortality bioassays involved incorporation of the toxins into the insect artificial diet, as previously described (MacIntosh et al., 1990). The toxin solution was mixed with the artificial diet at 50 °C and then dispensed into 24 multiwell-plates. Toxin concentrations in H. armigera ranged from 0.5 to 16 lg/ml for Cry1Ac and from 4 to 128 lg/ml for Cry1Fa and Cry2Ab and in E. insulana from 0.075 to 2.4 lg/ml for all three toxins. The same concentrations were used for the mixtures Cry1Ac + Cry1Fa and Cry1Ac + Cry2Ab, which were tested at three different proportions: 1:1, 1:4 and 4:1; e.g. for the mixture Cry1Ac + Cry1Fa in H. armigera, 16 lg/ml of Cry1Ac were mixed with 16 lg/ml of Cry1Fa to produce the highest concentration used in the bioassay and serial dilutions were performed. These particular ratios were chosen because mean Cry2Ab2:Cry1Ac ratio in the crop season is 3.5:1 (http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/biopesticides/ingredients/ factsheets/factsheet_006487.htm) and also because the first generation of H. armigera and E. insulana larvae appear in the month of June, when the mean levels expression of Cry2Ab are 3.6-fold greater those of Cry1Ac (Adamczyk et al., 2001). Mortality bioassays in E. insulana, for mixtures Cry1Ac:Cry1Fa were performed on the Egyptian population and for mixtures of Cry1Ac + Cry2Ab on the Spanish population, because the Egyptian population succumbed due to a bacterial infection halfway through the study. Groups of 24 neonate larvae were treated with each concentration of Bt alone or in mixtures. Negative control insects were mock-infected and positive controls comprised neonate larvae of known susceptible species to these toxins, i.e., Plutella xylostella, Spodoptera exigua, and Lobesia botrana. Each bioassay was performed three times. Insects were incubated at 25 °C, 60% RH, and a 14:10 (L:D) photoperiod. Mortality was recorded after 7 days. To determine larval growth inhibition, sub-lethal toxin concentrations were used following the method described above. The sub-lethal concentrations used for singly assayed toxins against H. armigera ranged from 16 to 8000 ng/ml for Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab, and from 250 to 8000 ng/ml for Cry1Fa. For E. insulana (Spanish population), each of the three toxins were administered in the range 5­150 ng/ml. For the assays with combined toxins, identical sub-lethal concentrations those of the most active toxin, Cry1Ac, were used. The live weight of surviving larvae (weighed in groups of four) was recorded after 7 days. Since Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab toxins caused similar mortality, but differed in their effect on growth inhibition in E. insulana, a new series of bioassays were performed using the two highest sub-lethal concentrations (75 and 150 ng/ ml) of each toxin that were administered to groups of 40 larvae per concentration. A total of four assays were performed and mortality and individual weights of the surviving larvae were recorded after 7 days.

2.5. Data analysis Concentration­mortality data were subjected to Probit regression analysis (Finney, 1971) using the POLO-PC program (LeOra Software, 1987) to calculate the mean lethal concentration (LC50) for individual toxins and mixtures of toxins. The observed and expected LC50 values for the individual toxins and the toxin mixtures in H. armigera and E. insulana were used to evaluate the interaction between Cry1Ac, Cry1Fa and Cry2Ab. To calculate the expected LC50 values for the toxin mixtures under the null hypothesis of no interaction the model ``simple similar action" or ``similar joint action" was used (Tabashnik, 1992). This model, which assumes that dose­response regression lines for different components of a mixture are parallel, is most appropriate for testing synergism of chemically similar poisons such as Bt toxins. The expected LC50 was calculated with the following mathematic expression:

3. Results 3.1. Mortality and growth inhibition caused by Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa toxins and mixtures 3.1.1. Mortality In H. armigera, the LC50 of Cry1Ac was 2.27 lg/ml, while Cry1Fa did not cause mortality at any of the assayed concentrations (Table 1). The effect of Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa was additive in all three mixtures, as the expected and observed LC50 were not significantly different (the expected values were included within the observed 95% fiducial limits). Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa mixtures in proportions 1:1 and 1:4, respectively, had relative potencies significantly lower than that of the Cry1Ac toxin alone, whereas the 4:1 mixture did not result in significantly different mortality from that of Cry1Ac alone. In the Tabashnik model, when the LC50 or EC50 values of one toxins are very high (as in the case of toxin Cry1Fa in H. armigera), the r/ CL50 ratios tend to zero, and therefore, their relative contribution to the toxicity of the mixture is insignificant. In E. insulana (Egyptian population), the LC50 values of Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa were 0.49 and 0.92 lg/ml, respectively, i.e. Cry1Ac was 2-fold more toxic than Cry1Fa (Table 1). The different Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa combinations had an additive effect in E. insulana (the expected values were included within the observed 95% fiducial limits). Mixtures in proportions 1:1 and 1:4 (Cry1Ac:Cry1Fa), had relative potencies significantly lower than that of Cry1Ac alone, while the 4:1 mixture did not show significant differences with respect to the single Cry1Ac toxin. Both these proteins showed higher toxicity against E. insulana than against H. armigera. 3.1.2. Growth inhibition In H. armigera, Cry1Ac had an EC50 of 22 ng/ml, whereas Cry1Fa barely inhibited growth (EC50 of 4460 ng/ml) (Table 2). Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa mixed in three different proportions had an additive effect on growth inhibition. In E. insulana (Spanish population), the Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa EC50 values were 29.6 and 72.3 ng/ml, respectively, and did not differ significantly from one another (Table 2). However, E. insulana larvae treated with Cry1Ac weighed significantly less than those treated with Cry1Fa when weights for concentrations ranging from 37.5 to 300 ng/ml were compared (Fig. 1). The three different mixtures of Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa all had additive effects on larval growth inhibition. The regression line slope values of the mixtures were found to lie between the slope values of the single toxins for both species, indicating that the concentration­responses of the mixtures were situated between those of the individual toxins.

where LC50(m) is the expected LC50 of the mixture of toxins a and b, LC50 (a) is the observed LC50 for toxin a alone, LC50 (b) is the observed LC50 for toxin b alone and ra and rb represent the relative proportions of toxin a and toxin b in the mixture, respectively. Larval growth was calculated as the difference between initial and final weights. Growth and concentration data were log transformed and the regression equation was calculated using the SPSS program v.12 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The estimated concentration causing 50% mean growth inhibition (EC50) for each individual toxin and toxin mixtures was calculated using the increase in weight observed in untreated control larvae as a reference. The 95% fiducial limits for the EC50 values were calculated as described by Sokal and Rohlf (1995). The similar action model was used to calculate the expected mean growth inhibition values (EC50(m)) for each mixture under the null hypothesis of no interaction (Tabashnik, 1992). To determine the existence of additive interaction, synergism or antagonism between toxins, we compared the expected LC50 or EC50 values, as calculated without synergism (Tabashnik model), with the fiducial limits of the observed LC50 or EC50 values. The combined effect of toxins was classified as additive if the expected value without synergism was within the 95% fiducial limits of the LC50 or EC50 values, synergistic if it was higher than the upper 95% fiducial limit, or antagonistic if it was less than the lower 95% fiducial limit.

EC50 of Cry1Ac was statistically similar in both species, while that of Cry1Fa was 60-fold lower for E. insulana than for H. armigera (Table 2). 3.2. Mortality and growth inhibition caused by Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab toxins and mixtures 3.2.1. Mortality In H. armigera, the LC50 of Cry1Ac (3.63 lg/ml) was 10-fold lower than that of Cry2Ab (36.95 lg/ml) (Table 3). A synergistic effect was observed with the three different mixtures. The synergism ratios increased with increasing relative proportions of Cry2Ab. (Table 3). Also, the three mixtures attained a statistically similar toxicity with respect to that of Cry1Ac, as observed by their respective relative potencies. In E. insulana (Spanish population), the LC50 values for Cry1Ac (0.35 lg/ml) and Cry2Ab (0.33 lg/ml) were not significantly different (Table 3). The effect of the three mixtures was additive. Cry2Ab was 112-fold more toxic for E. insulana than for H. armigera. 3.2.2. Growth inhibition In H. armigera, toxins administered individually showed no significant EC50 values (Table 4) whereas the three mixtures all showed additive effects. Although no synergism was observed be-

tween these toxins at the assayed concentrations, regression line slopes of all mixtures were significantly lower with respect to that of Cry2Ab alone. Also, the regression line slope of the 4:1 (Cry1Ac: Cry2Ab) mixture was lower than that of Cry1Ac. In other words, all toxin mixtures caused higher growth inhibition than the Cry2Ab toxin alone and this was also the case for the mixture of Cry1Ac with Cry2Ab, in the proportion of 4:1, with respect to Cry1Ac alone. In E. insulana (Spanish population), the EC50 values of Cry1Ac (22.2 ng/ml) and Cry2Ab (72.3 ng/ml), inoculated singly were not significantly different and had an additive effect when inoculated in three different combinations (Table 4). In spite of that, weight comparison of larvae inoculated with toxin concentrations ranging from 19 to 300 ng/ml showed that insects treated with Cry1Ac were significantly lighter than those treated with Cry2Ab (Fig. 2). The effects on growth inhibition caused by Cry1Ac at concentrations of 75 and 150 ng/ml were significant and more marked than at the same concentrations of Cry2Ab (Table 5). The mortality recorded for both toxins at each concentration was similar. Also, the effect of each toxin alone differed in terms of the variability observed in larval growth. Larvae treated with Cry2Ab were significantly more heterogeneous than those treated with Cry1Ac at 75 ng/ml (Levene's test on homogeneity of variances: W = 57.7; d.f. = 1; P < 0.001) and at 150 ng/ml (W = 63.3; d.f = 1; P < 0.001), (Table 5, Fig. 3).

larvae. Results showed that the susceptibility of these two species to the toxins was very different. Contrary to a previously published in a paper from our laboratory (Ibargutxi et al., 2006), in this study Cry1Fa and Cry2Ab toxins showed high toxic activity in E. insulana. Subsequent experiments carried out with the same batch of Cry1Fa and Cry2Ab toxins of the preceding work, demonstrated that the toxins had deteriorated during storage. All three assayed toxins were more toxic against E. insulana than against H. armigera. Cry1Ac was significantly more toxic than the other two in H. armigera and had similar activity than Cry2Ab in E. insulana, whereas Cry1Fa was the least toxic and caused no significant mortality in H. armigera. These results are consistent with most previous reports (Avilla et al., 2005; Ramos et al., 2004). However, while Liao et al. (2002) and ourselves both observed that Cry1Ac was more toxic than Cry2Ab in H. armigera, Bird and Akhust (2007) did not detect differences between these toxins in diet incorporation bioassays. This could be due to differences in methodology or to natural variability in the susceptibility of insect populations. In fact, significant differences in susceptibility to Cry toxins have been described among different H. armigera populations (Bird and Akhurst, 2007; Gujar et al., 2000; Wu et al., 1999), as well as in other heliothine populations (Lutrell et al., 1999; Stone and Sims, 1993). In this study, we also analyzed the nature of the interaction of Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa and of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab on H. armigera and E. insulana. These are the protein combinations that are being expressed in WideStrike and Bollgard II cotton plants, respectively. Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa showed an additive interaction in all proportions analyzed for both H. armigera and E. insulana. In view of these results, we believe that the combination of Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa in transgenic cotton is unlikely to provide any additional benefit for control of H. armigera with respect to plants expressing only Cry1Ac. However, the simultaneous expression of Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa may be important to delay resistance in E. insulana as long as these toxins do not share common binding sites in this host. In fact, receptor modification is the most frequent mechanism of in-

sect resistance to Cry toxins and has been shown to be the basis of cross-resistance among Cry1A toxins (Tabashnik et al., 1997). Importantly, binding studies have indicated the occurrence of a common receptor for Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa in H. armigera larvae (Hernández and Ferré, 2005), as well as in another major cotton pest (González-Cabrera et al., 2003). This type of study needs to be performed in E. insulana. Bollgard II expresses toxins Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab. Our analysis on the interaction of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab on H. armigera strongly suggests a synergistic relationship. A small but significant antagonistic interaction has been reported between toxins Cry2Aa (highly homologous to Cry2Ab) and Cry1Ac in this insect (Liao et al., 2002). However, different interactive effects have been described previously for closely related toxins in the same species. One example of this is Lymantria dispar (L.), in which Cry1Aa and Cry1Ac interacted synergistically whereas Cry1Aa interacted antagonistically in mixtures with Cry1Ab (Lee et al., 1996). Moreover, identical toxin combinations might have different interactive effects in different species, as occurs with Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab in H. armigera and E. insulana (this study) or with Cry1A (Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac Chimeric) and Cry2Ab, which showed additive effects in Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), H. virescens and H. zea (Greenplate et al., 2003). These observations suggest that the nature of the interactions between Bt toxins are difficult to generalize and should be analyzed for each protein combination in each insect host. Upon confirmation in plant, the importance of the synergism observed between Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab in H. armigera must be interpreted in the context of previous findings. First, Helicoverpa species are less susceptible to these toxins (Liao et al., 2002) and the expression of Cry1Ac toxin in Bollgard II declines as the season progresses (Greenplate et al., 2003). Second, alleles that confer resistance to Cry1Ac are rare in H. armigera, but those that confer resistance to Cry2Ab are surprisingly common (Downes et al., 2007). Consequently, synergic interactions between these toxins may diminish potentially resistant H. armigera larvae late in the growing season, when Cry1Ac declines to a level at which only Cry2Ab is effective. In addition, these toxins do not share binding sites in the midgut of H. armigera (Estela et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2007). Moreover, the toxic activity of Cry2Ab for H. armigera is relatively low throughout the season, but it is expressed at much higher levels than Cry1Ac in Bollgard II plants (http://www.icac. org/cotton_info/tis/biotech/documents/recorderdocs/march_03.pdf). This is unlikely to represent a problem for H. armigera control, since we found that low concentrations of Cry1Ac increase its toxic activity when combined with Cry2Ab. Indeed, mixtures of Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab in a proportion of 1:4 were as toxic as Cry1Ac alone, and reached the highest synergistic levels (3.12). Although, the level of Cry2Ab2 expression, is greater than 10 times the level of Cry1Ac expression in Bollgard II at the end of crop season, mean

levels are 3.5-fold greater (http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/biopesticides/ingredients/factsheets/factsheet_006487.htm). On the other hand, the first generation of H. armigera and E. insulana, appear in cotton crops in the month of June, when the mean expression levels of Cry2Ab are 3.6-fold greater than mean expression levels of of Cry1Ac (Adamczyk et al., 2001). Therefore, the mixture involving the proportion 4:1 (Cry2Ab:Cry1Ac), in which we observed the highest synergism ratio (3.12), represents an average over the entire growing season including the early crop season, when founding populations of these pests can be more easily controlled. Although the mechanisms of the interaction between Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab are unknown, we hypothesize that the toxic effect of Cry2Ab could weaken larvae and thus increase the lethality of Cry1Ac. However, other mechanisms may be involved, as indicated by the slope of growth inhibition values, that showed a tendency to be synergistic at higher concentrations (lethal concentrations). Nevertheless, field assays are necessary to confirm the observed in vitro synergisms in the plant since both toxin expression levels, and their behavior in the plant, depend on the physiological state of the plant and its component parts (Greenplate, 1999; Kranthi et al., 2005; Olsen and Daly, 2000). In E. insulana, no synergism was observed between Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab but both these toxins showed a high toxic activity individually and in combination. Binding studies are needed to determine whether they share receptors in this species and, therefore, whether cross-resistance is likely to occur in Bollgard II plants. The single toxins that we tested all caused important degrees of larval growth inhibition. The EC50 values for H. armigera were directly correlated with their LC50 values. The weights of E. insulana and H. armigera larvae treated with sub-lethal concentrations of Cry1Ac were significantly reduced with respect to control insects. Also, treated larvae were unable to molt to second instars, whereas controls reached third or fourth instars by day seven. The EC50 values of Cry2Ab were similar to those of Cry1Ac in both species, although in E. insulana some larvae exposed to the lowest concentrations of Cry2Ab survived to reach the second and third instars. This could result in increased crop loss and favor selection of individuals resistant to Cry2Ab when the expression level of Cry1Ac is reduced. Cry1Fa caused similar growth inhibition as Cry1Ac for E. insulana, but this toxin showed much lower inhibition values than Cry1Ac in H. armigera. It is possible that Cry toxins cause midgut damage that prevents food assimilation (Escriche and Ferré, 2001) and inhibits feeding (Angus and Heimpel, 1959). Mixtures of Cry1Ac and Cry1Fa or Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab had additive effects on growth inhibition in all hosts and proportions studied. In contrast, synergism between Cry1Ac and Cry1F has been reported in H. armigera (Chakrabarti et al., 1998b), which was much higher than other researchers have described between Cry toxins in lepidopterans (Lee et al., 1996; Xue et al., 2005). These differences may be explained by the use of different types of Cry1F toxins or to differences in the Bt strains used in the production of Cry1F. The sub-lethal effects of Cry toxins on growth, that have been previously described in these species (Avilla et al., 2005; Ramos et al., 2004), may be important in particular agronomic contexts. In cotton crops, the most costly damage is produced by late instars that attack cotton bolls. Nibouche et al. (2007) calculated that H. armigera sixth instars consume 86% of the total larval needs, whereas first and second instars consume only 0.04% and 0.15%, respectively. In this context, Bt crops expressing combined Cry proteins that delay larval growth may be beneficial. In conclusion, this study suggests that each particular toxin or toxin combination expressed in transgenic Bt cotton should be carefully selected depending on the most important pests present in each geographical region. In this study, the same toxins as those

expressed by Bt-cotton varieties showed high toxic activity alone or in combination against E. insulana, but other toxins show as high an activity as these (Ibargutxi et al., 2006). The insecticidal activity of the toxins studied here was considerably lower against H. armigera. Additional studies such as binding assays, frequency of toxinresistance alleles, and field assays are necessary in cotton pests other than H. armigera, like E. insulana, to determine if these Bt cotton plants are well suited for use in Europe or other regions of the world.
