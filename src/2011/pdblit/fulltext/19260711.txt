Box 4000, Princeton, New Jersey, 08543-4000 ReceiVed December 16, 2008 Abstract: Substituted N-(4-(2-aminopyridin-4-yloxy)-3-fluoro-phenyl)1-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carboxamides were identified as potent and selective Met kinase inhibitors. Substitution of the pyridine 3-position gave improved enzyme potency, while substitution of the pyridone 4-position led to improved aqueous solubility and kinase selectivity. Analogue 10 demonstrated complete tumor stasis in a Metdependent GTL-16 human gastric carcinoma xenograft model following oral administration. Because of its excellent in vivo efficacy and favorable pharmacokinetic and preclinical safety profiles, 10 has been advanced into phase I clinical trials.

disclosed. Replacement of the pendent acylurea moiety by a conformationally constrained 2-pyridone to give Met kinase inhibitors with potent antiproliferative activity in a Metdependent human gastric carcinoma GTL-16 cell line was subsequently reported.6 Herein, we describe application of the 2-pyridone fragment to the aminopyridine chemotype, which ultimately led to identification of a compound for clinical development. The synthesis, SAR, structural biology, and preclinical assessment of aminopyridines are described.

Met kinase, also known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor, is an oncogenic transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in a variety cancers.1,2 Binding of its endogenous ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor (SF), results in dimerization of the Met kinase receptor and intermolecular transphosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain. The resulting activated enzyme binds and phosphorylates adaptor proteins at a multifunctional docking site, which in turn activates signal transducers to mediate a variety of cellular responses including cell growth, migration and invasion, tumor metastasis, angiogenesis, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. While normal Met/HGF signaling plays a critical role in placental development and liver regeneration,3 aberrant Met signaling can lead to oncogenic transformation. Met kinase can become dysregulated via a variety of mechanisms including ligand-dependent activation, activating mutations, Met overexpression, and interactions with other receptor families (heterodimerization/cross-talk).1 The structure-activity relationships (SARs) of several Met kinase inhibitors derived from pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine,4 pyrrolopyridine,5 and aminopyridine5 scaffolds were recently

Pyridone 16 is a potent inhibitor of Met kinase (IC50 ) 1.8 nM) with excellent activity in the Met-driven GTL-16 cell proliferation assay (IC50 ) 60 nM). Application of the conformationally constrained 2-pyridone ring to the aminopyridine series gave parent pyridone 2 (IC50 ) 4.5 nM, GTL-16 IC50 ) 170 nM), which served as a starting point for SAR analysis. On the basis of X-ray crystal structures of related analogues,4-6 we hypothesized that these inhibitors would occupy the Met ATP-binding site and that substitution of the pyridine C-3 position would provide access to the pocket occupied by the ribose group of ATP. As described in an earlier series, additional interactions with the Met protein could be gained by projecting solubilizing groups such as alcohols and amines into the ribose pocket.4 We initially sought to introduce such groups in the aminopyridine series via a linker at the pyridine C-3 position to simultaneously improve potency, solubility, and the CYP450 inhibition profile. Alcohols and amines were appended to the aminopyridine core via a carbon linker, and representative analogues are depicted in Table 1. N-Methylpiperazine 3 gave excellent potency in the biochemical assay (IC50 ) 5.9 nM), demonstrating that substitution at the pyridine C-3 position was tolerated. However, disappointing results were obtained in the GTL-16 cell-based assay (GTL-16 IC50 ) 2800 nM). In our previous work, rigid amines with limited degrees of freedom gave enhanced Met potency. Application of this concept as in propargylamine 4 gave similar biochemical potency but improved cellular activity (IC50 ) 3.8 nM, GTL-16 IC50 ) 210 nM). The corresponding propargyl alcohol 5 gave an exceptionally potent Met inhibitor in the biochemical and cell-based assays (IC50 ) 2.7 nM, GTL-16 IC50 ) 23 nM). Methanol adduct 6 gave similar biochemical inhibition (IC50 ) 3.4 nM) but was 10-fold less potent in cells relative to the propargyl alcohol (GTL-16 IC50 ) 280 nM). Intrigued by the excellent cellular potency of propargylic alcohol 5 and with the desire to keep the pyridine C-3 substituent small, we prepared the unsubstituted propargylic compound 7. This analogue also demonstrated potent inhibition of Met kinase in biochemical and cell-based assays (IC50 ) 1.0 nM, GTL-16 IC50 ) 31 nM) but suffered from potent CYP450 inhibition (3A4, IC50 < 1 µM), a common problem among the propargyl analogues. Replacement of the propargyl unit with a simple

branched alkyl group such as isopropyl provided no benefit (8, IC50 ) 3.4 nM, GTL-16 IC50 ) 120 nM). Finally, 3-chloro analogue 9 was found to potently inhibit Met kinase with an IC50 of 1.0 nM while maintaining excellent cellular potency (GTL-16 IC50 ) 57 nM). Chloro-substituted aminopyridine 9 benefited from excellent stability in mouse liver microsomes (MLM ) 0.012 (nmol/min)/mg protein) and an encouraging CYP450 profile (3A4 IC50 ) 4 µM; 2C9 IC50 ) 7 µM; 2C19, 2D6, 1A2 IC50 values of >20 µM); therefore, it was selected as a scaffold for pyridone SAR exploration to improve kinase selectivity and the CYP450 profile. A series of alkoxy groups was appended to the pyridone ring at R2 (Table 1). Ethoxy analogue 10 inhibited Met kinase with an IC50 of 3.9 nM (GTL-16 IC50 ) 100 nM). In addition, compound 10 demonstrated >40-fold improvement in aqueous solubility at pH 1.0 (aqueous solubility ) 400 µg/mL, crystalline).7 The dramatic improvement in aqueous solubility can be attributed to a deviation from planarity induced by the R2 substituent which results in disruption of crystal packing forces (vide infra). Replacement of the R1 chlorine atom of 10 with other halogens (e.g., F, Br) or a methyl substituent provided analogues with inferior cellular potency. Additional alkoxy groups were examined at R2 with isopropoxy analogue 11 giving an in vitro potency (IC50 ) 3.2 nM, GTL-16 IC50 ) 140 nM) similar to that of 10. Likewise, introduction of an alcohol provided no benefit (12, IC50 ) 2.6 nM, GTL-16 IC50 ) 250 nM). On the basis of its relatively low molecular weight,

improved aqueous solubility, attractive in vitro profile, and desirable metabolic stability/CYP450 profile (IC50 values > 20 µM), 10 was selected for further characterization in kinase selectivity, PK, and in vivo efficacy studies. Compound 10 was prepared according to the synthetic sequence outlined in Scheme 1. Commercially available 3,4dichloropyridine 13 was converted to acid 14 by deprotonation with LiTMP and quenching with dry ice.8 The resulting acid was converted to amide 15 under standard conditions. Nucleophilic displacement of the C-4 chloride of 15 with 4-amino-2fluorophenol gave key intermediate 16. The pyridone subunit 19 was synthesized from 4-iodo-2-methoxynicotinaldehyde.9 Thus, the methyl ether of 17 was cleaved with TMSI and the resulting amide was arylated with 4-fluorophenylboronic acid using copper(II) acetate.10 Oxidation of aldehyde 18 to the corresponding acid followed by acid chloride formation gave intermediate 19. Amine 16 and acid chloride 19 were joined under standard conditions, and the iodide was reacted with sodium ethoxide to give ethyl ether 20. Finally, Hoffman rearrangement delivered 10 in high yield. An X-ray crystal structure of 10 complexed to the Met kinase domain confirmed that 10 resides in the ATP-binding site with the activation loop in an inactive, DFG-out conformation (Figure 1).11 The 2-aminopyridine core anchors inhibitor 10 to the hinge region via two key hydrogen bonding interactions with Met1160; the backbone NH of Met1160 donates a hydrogen bond to the pyridine nitrogen, while the backbone carbonyl of Met1160 accepts a hydrogen bond from the 2-amino group. As postulated, the 3-chloro group is directed toward the ribose pocket. The central phenyl ring -stacks with Phe1223 (DFG motif) and is flanked on the opposite face by gatekeeper residue Leu1157. The pyridone carbonyl forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the amide NH and a second hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of Asp1222. Finally, the terminal phenyl ring occupies a deep hydrophobic pocket defined by Phe1134, Leu1195, and Phe1200. Compound 10 was evaluated in an in-house kinase selectivity panel (Table 2). The Ki was determined for Met kinase (Ki ) 4.6 ( 0.3 nM), and while 10 was found to be a potent inhibitor of Met family member Ron and three phylogenetically related

kinases (Axl, Tyro-3, and Mer), it was more than 40-fold selective versus Lck, VEGFR-2, and TrkA/B and more than 500-fold selective versus all other receptor and nonreceptor kinases in the panel. To further examine its selectivity, 10 was profiled against more than 200 kinases in the Ambit phagebased competition binding assay (Figure 2).12 In this assay, results are reported as % control at a 10 µM screening

concentration. A result of <1% control correlates with a Kd < 1-3 µM. As expected, Met-related kinases (Ron, Axl, Tyro-3, Mer) and several other kinases from Table 2 (AurB, Flt-3, Lck, TrkA/B) registered binding of <1% control. A handful of other kinases registered <1% control and were followed up in a twopoint assay where IC50 values were estimated to be between 50 and 500 nM (LOK, Tie-2, Mnk2, Musk) or >500 nM (Blk, Epha3, Kit, Src). A cellular proliferation assay was used to determine the IC50 for PDGFR (IC50 ) 1 µM). To conclude, our in-house kinase selectivity panel and the Ambit binding assay confirmed 10 to be a potent and selective inhibitor of the Met kinase superfamily. The antiproliferative activity of 10 was explored in additional cellular settings, and 10 demonstrated selective inhibition of proliferation in Met-driven tumor cell lines. In addition to potent inhibition of proliferation of the GTL-16 cell line, which contains an amplified Met gene locus, 10 also inhibited proliferation in Met-driven H1993 (non-small-cell lung cancer, Met amplification, IC50 ) 150 nM) and U87 (glioblastoma, autocrine loop, IC50 ) 160 nM) cell lines. Importantly, 10 lacked activity against the Met-independent N87 cell line (gastric, IC50 > 10 000 nM). Phosphorylation levels of the Met protein in GTL-16 cell lysates was determined following a 30 min incubation period (Figure 3). Phosphorylation of the Met receptor was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, consistent with the observed in vitro activity and also consistent with the activity in GTL-16 cells being a result of Met kinase inhibition. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained for 10 in mouse, rat, and dog are summarized in Table 3. After iv administration, 10 demonstrated a moderate steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) in mouse and rat and low systemic clearance (Cl) compared to hepatic blood flow for all species. The compound was well absorbed after oral administration of drug from solution formulation with favorable half-lives (t1/2) and mean residence times (MRT). Furthermore, the measured oral bioavailabilities (Fpo) were excellent in all three species (100%).13

Figure 4. In vivo efficacy of 10 versus GTL-16 human tumor xenografts in athymic mice (1qd x 14).

On the basis of its encouraging pharmacokinetic profile, 10 was evaluated in in vivo efficacy studies (Figure 4). A GTL-16 xenograft model was examined in which tumor cells were implanted subcutaneously and staged to approximately 125 mm3 prior to commencement of once daily oral dosing of compound for 14 consecutive days. Compound 10 was active at all dose levels tested as defined by >50% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) over one tumor volume doubling time (TVDT).14 The minimum efficacious dose of 6.25 mg/kg corresponded to a TGI of 66%, and complete tumor stasis was observed throughout the dosing period at 25 and 50 mg/kg doses (TGI ) 95% and 102%, respectively). The antitumor activity of 10 was dose responsive, and the measured drug exposures at each dose level were dose proportional (6.25 mg/kg, Cmax ) 4.5 µM, AUC0-24h ) 37 µM · h; 50 mg/kg, Cmax ) 43.7 µM, AUC0-24h ) 567 µM · h). No overt toxicity was observed at any of these dose levels as defined by weight loss or morbidity. In conclusion, novel substituted N-(4-(2-aminopyridin-4yloxy)-3-fluoro-phenyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridine-3-carboxamides were identified as potent inhibitors of Met kinase activity. Optimization of the series SAR led to identification of 10, a highly selective and orally bioavailable Met kinase inhibitor. Complete tumor stasis was achieved in the GTL-16 human gastric carcinoma xenograft model following oral administration with no observed toxicity. On the basis of its favorable in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetic profile, and safety profile, 10 has been advanced into clinical trials. Acknowledgment.
