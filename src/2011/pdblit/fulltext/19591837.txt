It was shown that the inhibitory effect induced by high concentration Zn2+ (1 mM) was abolished or significantly attenuated in Ca2+-free (0 mM) Ringer's, but significantly enhanced in high-Ca2+ (20 mM) Ringer's. However, the Zn2+ (10 µM) potentiation effect was not changed either in Ca2+-free (0 mM) or high-Ca2+ (20 mM) Ringer's. These results suggest that the Zn2+ potentiation effect involves the interaction with CTZ binding-site on the AMPA receptors, while the Zn2+ inhibitory effect is related to the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Overall, the dual-effects that Zn2+ exerts on Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors on retinal horizontal cells are mediated by separate mechanisms.

Redenti et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2008). It has been well accepted that Zn2+ could modulate the AMPA-preferring glutamate receptors in retinal HCs (Schmidt, 1999; Shen and Yang, 1999; Zhang et al., 2002). Our recent work also proved the dual-effects that Zn2+ exerted on CP-AMPARs on carp retinal H1 HCs (Sun et al., 2010): application of Zn2+ at low concentration (10 µM) potentiated the CP-AMPAR-mediated current by abolishing the receptor desensitization; but application of Zn2+ at high concentrations (100 and 1000 µM) inhibited the current in a dose-dependent manner.

However, the mechanism(s) of Zn2+-effects on modulating the AMPARs is not well understood. Given that the potentiation of CP-AMPARs on HCs by low concentration Zn2+ is similar to the cyclothiazide (CTZ) effect (Yamada and Tang, 1993; Wong and Mayer, 1993), both of which could block AMPARs' desensitization, we conducted experiments to investigate whether the Zn2+ potentiation effect was related to the CTZ-binding site on CP-AMPARs. In addition, given the high Ca2+-permeability of CP-AMPARs, we speculated that extracellular Ca2+ might be also involved in the Zn2+-effects in modulating these receptors. In the present study, we first examined the Zn2+-effects exerted on CP-AMPARs on carp retinal H1 HCs in the presence of CTZ.

2.1 The Zn2+ potentiation effect was more remarkable in increasing the current-amplitude in the presence of 20 µM CTZ A typical experimental recording showing the Zn2+ potentiation effect in the presence of 20 µM CTZ is plotted in Fig. 1B. In the presence of 20 µM CTZ, glutamate (3 mM) elicited an inward current in an isolated H1 HC with the peak current being 450.3 pA. When 10 µM Zn2+ was pre-superfused for 10 s, the peak current elicited by 3 mM glutamate was enhanced to 787.5 pA. After Zn2+ was washed out for 1 min, the peak current elicited by 3 mM glutamate recovered to 437.5 pA. Statistical data given in Fig. 1C show that the CP-AMPAR-mediated peak currents were potentiated to 150.6 ± 25.5% of the control level (mean ± SD, p < 0.05, n = 8) in the presence of 20 µM CTZ. Application of 10 µM Zn2+ significantly enhanced the amplitude of the current mediated by CP-AMPARs in the presence of 20 µM CTZ, which is remarkably different from the Zn2+ (10 µM) effect observed in the absence of CTZ, which potentiated the CP-AMPAR-mediated current by abolishing the current desensitization but without significant changes (99.5 ± 11.2% of the control level) in the current amplitude (see Fig. 1C).

was also tested (see Fig. 2B). In the presence of 20 µM CTZ, glutamate (3 mM) elicited an inward current of 514.3 pA (peak current) which was reduced to 170.4 pA after pre-superfusion with 1 mM Zn2+ for 10 s. When Zn2+ was washed out for 1 min, the peak current recovered to 493.0 pA. Statistical data given in Fig. 2C show that the CP-AMPAR-mediated currents were decreased to 26.4 ± 12.0% of the control level after application of 1 mM Zn2+ in the presence of CTZ (peak current, mean ± SD, p < 0.05, n = 5). This inhibitory effect was not significantly different (p > 0.05, unpaired t-test) from that observed in the absence of CTZ (21.1 ± 9.7% of the control level, see Fig. 2C).

The dose-dependent curve of Zn2+-effects in modulating the CP-AMPAR-mediated current in the absence and presence of CTZ (20 µM) are plotted in Fig. 3. Different levels of Zn2+ (1 µM, 10 µM, 30 µM, 100 µM, 300 µM, and 1000 µM) respectively changed the CP-AMPAR-responses to 95.9 ± 17.8%, 99.5 ± 11.2%, 97.0 ± 8.9%, 72.2 ± 4.7%, 53.4 ± 9.3%, 21.1 ± 9.7% (mean ± SD) of the control level in the absence of CTZ (n = 5, black curve); while the same levels of Zn2+ respectively changed the CP-AMPAR-responses to 147.0 ± 6.2% (n = 8), 150.6 ± 25.5% (n = 8), 103.0 ± 22.4%, 63.4 ± 7.7%, 61.2 ± 5.8%, 26.4 ± 12.0% (mean ± SD) of the control level in the presence of 20 µM CTZ (n = 5 otherwise indicated, gray curve).

A typical experimental recording is plotted in Fig. 4A. In Ca2+-free Ringer's containing 20 µM CTZ, glutamate (3 mM) elicited an inward current in an isolated H1 HC with the peak current being 1114.7 pA. When 1 mM Zn2+ was pre-superfused for 10 s, the peak current elicited by 3 mM glutamate was enhanced to 1601.3 pA. After Zn2+ was washed out for 1 min, the peak current elicited by 3 mM glutamate recovered to 1042.7 pA. Statistical data given in Fig. 4C show that instead of inhibition, application of 1 mM Zn2+ potentiated the CP-AMPAR-mediated currents to 144.6 ± 24.7% of the control level (peak current, mean ± SD, p < 0.05, n = 8) in Ca2+-free Ringer's containing 20 µM CTZ. This is significantly different (p < 0.05, unpaired t-test) from the inhibitory effect induced by 1 mM Zn2+ in normal-Ca2+ (2.0 mM) Ringer's containing (26.4 ± 12.0% of the control level, see Fig. 4C) or not containing (21.1 ± 9.7% of the control level, see Fig. 2A, 2C) 20 µM CTZ. The Zn2+ inhibitory effect exerted on CP-AMPAR-mediated current elicited by KA, a full agonist of AMPARs, was further tested in Ca2+-free Ringer's. The results are plotted in Fig. 5A. It is clearly shown that in Ca2+-free Ringer's, application of 100 µM KA elicited an non-desensitizing current of 511.1 pA, which was reduced to 311.7 pA after pre-superfusion with 1 mM Zn2+ for 10 s and recovered to 477.8 pA after 1 min

1 mM Zn2+ for 10 s. When Zn2+ was washed away for 1 min, the peak current recovered to 918.2 pA. Statistical data given in Fig. 4C show that the CP-AMPAR-mediated currents were reduced to 15.3 ± 8.3% of the control level (peak current, mean ± SD, p < 0.05, n = 8) by application of 1 mM Zn2+ in high-Ca2+ Ringer's. The Zn2+ inhibitory effect was significantly strengthened in high-Ca2+ Ringer's (containing 20 µM CTZ) as compared to the effect in both CTZ-containing normal-Ca2+ (2.0 mM) and Ca2+-free Ringer's (p < 0.05, unpaired t-test). The Zn2+ inhibitory effect on the KA-elicited current mediated by CP-AMPARs was also examined in high-Ca2+ Ringer's. As shown in Fig. 5B, application of 100 µM KA elicited a non-desensitizing current of 461.1 pA in an isolated H1 HC in high-Ca2+ Ringer's. This current was reduced to 138.9 pA after pre-superfusion of 1 mM Zn2+ for 10 s. After Zn2+ was washed out for 1 min, the KA-elicited current recovered to 433.3 pA. Statistical data presented in Fig. 5C show that the KA-elicited currents were reduced to 29.6 ± 5.7% (mean ± SD, p < 0.05, n = 8) of the control level during Zn2+ (1 mM) application in high-Ca2+ Ringer's. This Zn2+ inhibition of KA-elicited current mediated by CP-AMPARs was significantly strengthened as compared to that in normal-Ca2+ (2.0 mM) and Ca2+-free Ringer's (p < 0.05, unpaired t-test). These results indicate that the inhibitory effect that high concentration Zn2+ exerts on CP-AMPAR-mediated current is related to the extracellular Ca2+ concentration.

current was abolished or attenuated in Ca2+-free Ringer's, but strengthened in

Meanwhile, the inhibitory effect induced by high concentration Zn2+ is related to the extracellular Ca2+.

In addition to the amplitude enhancement, the desensitization process of the CP-AMPAR-mediated current was also slowed down by 10 µM Zn2+ in the presence of 20 µM CTZ (see Fig. 1B). However, this partial block of the desensitization process differs from that of the Zn2+ (10 µM) effect in the absence of CTZ, which completely blocked the desensitization of CP-AMPAR-mediated response (see Fig. 1A). In order to further estimate the interaction between CTZ and Zn2+ (10 µM) on CP-AMPARs, CTZ at various concentrations (0.1 ~ 300 µM) was applied in our experiments (see supplementary Fig. I). The results were such that moderate concentrations (5 ~ 100 µM) of CTZ could enhance the Zn2+ potentiation effect by increasing the peak current amplitude; while lower (<5 µM) or higher (>100 µM) concentrations of CTZ could abolish the Zn2+ potentiation effect either by decreasing the peak current amplitude or speeding up the current desensitization process, respectively. Although the difference between the mechanisms underlying the Zn2+ potentiation effects in the absence and presence of CTZ is still not clear, it can almost be certain that the Zn2+ potentiation effect is related to the CTZ-binding site of CP-AMPARs on H1 HCs. Since the potentiation of CP-AMPAR-mediated current by low concentration Zn2+ may be involved in the regulation of the physiological activities of retinal HCs, the modulation

(GluR1 and GluR3) expressed on Xenopus oocytes, the Zn2+ potentiation effect was

inclined to inhibit the receptors (Dreixler and Leonard, 1997). However, our results demonstrate that the Zn2+ potentiation of CP-AMPAR-response of carp H1 HCs was not affected by the extracellular Ca2+. On the other hand, the Zn2+ inhibition of the response was abolished (turned into a potentiation effect) or attenuated in Ca2+-free Ringer's, but strengthened in high-Ca2+ Ringer's. In the experiments investigating the involvement of extracellular Ca2+ in Zn2+ inhibitory effect, "glutamate + CTZ" and KA were used respectively to elicit the CP-AMPAR-mediated current on H1 HCs to avoid the underestimation of the peak current. The results obtained from these two sets of parallel experiments were basically compatible. In Ca2+-free Ringer's, Zn2+ (1 mM) effect changed to potentiation of the response elicited by "glutamate + CTZ" instead of inhibition (see Fig. 4A, 4C); while the Zn2+ inhibition of the response elicited by KA was significantly attenuated (see Fig. 5A, 5C). Moreover, in high-Ca2+ Ringer's, both sets of the results show that high-Ca2+ condition facilitated the Zn2+ (1 mM) inhibitory effect on CP-AMPAR-responses elicited by either "glutamate + CTZ" or KA (see Fig. 4B, 4C and Fig. 5B, 5C). Given the high Ca2+-permeability of CP-AMPARs, the involvement of extracellular Ca2+ in Zn2+-effects seems readily acceptable. The interaction between the endogenous Zn2+ and Ca2+ may occur at the agonist-binding site, the receptor channel pore or other functional site(s) inside the channel. Our recent study has shown that the Zn2+-effects

excitotoxicity. In pathological conditions, the CP-AMPARs on the postsynaptic membrane are over-activated by glutamate released from presynaptic neurons, which in turn leads to excessive influx of Ca2+ into the postsynaptic neurons and, finally, induces cell-death (for reviews, see Ugarte and Osborne, 2001; Kwak and Weiss, 2006). Meanwhile, the co-released Zn2+ with glutamate, accumulated in high concentration in the synaptic cleft might protect the neurons from further Ca2+ influx by inhibiting the CP-AMPARs on these neurons, and this Zn2+ protection effect may be further regulated by interaction with the endogenous Ca2+. In summary, the dual-effects that Zn2+ exerts on CP-AMPARs on retinal HCs might be related to the CTZ-binding site on these receptors and the extracellular concentration of Ca2+, respectively. Therefore, the modulation of CTZ-binding site on CP-AMPARs and/or changing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration might regulate the Zn2+ dual-effects on these receptors and further influence the physiological and/or pathological role(s) of CP-AMPARs on retinal HCs.

The H1 HC was easily distinguished by its characteristic morphology (Jiang et al., 2008). Glutamate (Glu), Kainate (KA), pentobarbital (PB) and ZnCl2 (Zn2+) were dissolved in the Ringer's solution. Cyclothiazide (CTZ) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted to the final concentration in Ringer's solution (DMSO < 0.5%).

The pH value for all the solutions were adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. All the drugs were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). 4.2 Whole-cell recording and drug application Cells were voltage-clamped at -60 mV and whole-cell recordings were achieved by 5~8M patch pipette pulled from borosilicate glass (Sutter Instrument Inc., USA)
