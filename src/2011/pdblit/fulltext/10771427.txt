Bdellastasin is a 59-amino-acid, cysteine-rich, antistasin-type inhibitor of sperm acrosin, plasmin and trypsin, isolated from the medicinal leech Hirudo medicinalis. The complex formed between bdellastasin and porcine -trypsin has previously been crystallized in the presence of PEG in a tetragonal crystal form of space group P43212 and has now been found to crystallize under high-salt conditions in the enantiomorphic space group P41212. These structures have been solved and Ê re®ned to 2.8 and 2.7 A resolution, respectively. Bdellastasin turns out to have an antistasin-like fold exhibiting a bisdomainal structure. In the second new crystal form, the ¯exible N-terminal subdomain is rotated with respect to the C-terminal subdomain by about 90 , ®tting into a cavity formed by symmetry-related trypsin molecules. The canonical inhibitor±proteinase interaction is restricted to the primary binding loop comprising residues Leu31±Lys36 of bdellastasin. During the re®nement, a bound sodium ion occupying the calcium-binding site of the porcine -trypsin component was discovered. This sodium ion is coordinated in a tetragonal± pyramidal manner, with the geometry of the enclosing loop slightly changed compared with the loop in the presence of calcium. In the crystal form of space group P43212, the electron density for residue 115 of porcine -trypsin clearly indicates the presence of a -isomerized l-aspartic acid, which is placed in spatial proximity to segment Thr144±Gly148 of a symmetry-related trypsin molecule. This is the ®rst structurally observed example of an l-isoaspartate in -trypsin originating from Asn. A comparison with other known crystal structures of porcine -trypsin±macromolecular inhibitor complexes suggests that the deamidation, isomerization and racemization of Asn115 is the key step in crystallization.

1. Introduction
Deamidation and racemization of l-asparagine and l-glutamine residues appear to be one of the most common nonenzymatic modi®cations of peptides and proteins (Clarke et al., 1992; Gracy, 1992; Harding et al., 1989; Wright, 1991). Studies on proteins and model peptides (Geiger & Clarke, 1987; Patel & Borchardt, 1990) have shown that under neutral or basic conditions the reaction proceeds via a succinimide derivative, which by spontaneous hydrolysis generates either an -linked or a -linked Asp (isoaspartyl) residue (Fig. 1). The rate of deamidation strongly depends on the nature of the side chain of the carboxyl-sided residue, with Asn±Gly or Asn±Ser being the most susceptible amino-acid pairs (Geiger & Clarke, 1987; Capasso et al., 1989; Tyler-Cross & Schirch, 1991). The approximate ratio of - to -linked product is 1:3 for synthetic oligopeptides (Meinwald et al., 1986) and for

proteins (Capasso et al., 1991, 1996; Brennan & Clarke, 1993; Di Donato et al., 1993). In vivo, similar post-translational modi®cations of proteins have been reported for A-crystallin (Fujii, Satoh et al., 1994; Takemoto & Boyle, 1998) and B-crystallin (Fujii, Ishibashi et al., 1994) from young and aged human eye lenses, for -amyloid peptide from Alzheimer's diseased brains (Roher et al., 1993), for the microtubule-binding domain of tau (Watanabe et al., 1999), for tubulin (Najbauer et al., 1996) and for the high-mass methyl-accepting protein (HMAP) of the mammalian brain (David et al., 1998). Therefore, many organisms have evolved a strategy for reversing at least part of this damage by an enzymatic methylation reaction. The widely distributed cytosolic protein l-isoaspartate-(d-aspartate)-O-methyltransferase can initiate the conversion of l-isoaspartyl residues to l-aspartyl residues by forming the methyl ester (Brennan et al., 1994) and thus starting the `repair' pathway. Furthermore, an additional mechanism exists for the removal of isoaspartyl residues from polypeptides, including a catabolic pathway. The presence of such a degradative mechanism in Escherichia coli is supported by the existence of an isoaspartyl dipeptidase activity (Haley, 1968). It was shown that the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of a speci®c subset of l-isoaspartyl-containing dipeptides but does not catalyze the cleavage of corresponding normal aspartyl dipeptides (Gary & Clarke, 1995). Despite the numerous chemical and biological studies on deamidation, isomerization and racemization reactions in proteins, only a few crystallographic observations of linked Asp residues have so far been presented. This is not surprising, considering that labile Asn residues are normally located in ¯exible segments of the polypeptide chain characterized by a relatively poor electron density, which may well have prevented detection of alternative conformations. The ®rst structural information regarding a deamidated protein comes from a neutron-diffraction study of aged bovine pancreatic trypsin (Kossiakoff, 1988), presenting a clear indication of three deamidated sites involving trypsin residues Asn48, Asn95 and Asn115. Previously, l-isoaspartate residues have been reported for Asn67 of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (Capasso et al., 1996), for Asp45 of Ustilago spherogena ribonuclease U2 (Noguchi et al., 1995) and recently for Asp101 of hen eggwhite lysozyme (Noguchi et al., Figure 1 1998). Furthermore, a d-asparPathways for the spontaneous deamidation, isomerization and racemization of asparaginyl and aspartyl tate has been shown for residue residues. l-Asparaginyl (l-Asn) and l-aspartyl (l-Asp) residues can spontaneously convert via a Asn115 of porcine -trypsin in succinimidyl intermediate to l-isoaspartate (l-Ias), d-aspartate (d-Asp) and d-isoaspartate (d-Ias) (scheme complex with the leech-derived modi®ed from Watanabe et al., 1999).

tryptase inhibitor (LDTI; Di Marco & Priestle, 1997). Here, we report the ®nding of an l-isoaspartate 115 detected in the porcine -trypsin±bdellastasin complex structure. Bdellastasin is a 59 amino-acid, cysteine-rich, antistasintype inhibitor directed toward sperm acrosin, plasmin and trypsin (Fritz et al., 1971; Fritz & Krejci, 1976) and is found to tightly bind and inhibit trypsin as well as plasmin in the nanomolar range (Ki = 1.0 and 12 nM, respectively; Moser et al., 1998). The inhibitor has recently been expressed in high yield in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Moser et al., 1998) and has been crystallized in complex with bovine and porcine -trypsin in the monoclinic space group P21 and the tetragonal space group P43212, respectively (Rester et al., 1999). The structures have been solved and have been re®ned to 3.3 and Ê 2.8 A resolution, respectively. Bdellastasin displays an antistasin-like fold exhibiting a bis-domainal brick-shaped structure similar to that of the tissue kallikrein inhibitor hirustasin Â (Mittl et al., 1997; Uson et al., 1999). The interaction between bdellastasin and trypsin is restricted to the C-terminal subdomain of bdellastasin, particularly to its primary binding loop comprising residues Asp30±Glu38 (Rester et al., 1999). We have now obtained a second tetragonal crystal form of the porcine -trypsin-bdellastasin complex under high-salt conditions. We have solved this structure in the enantiomorphic space group P41212. The purpose of this paper is to communicate this structure and to analyze the role of crystallization conditions on the deamidation and isomerization of Asn115 of porcine -trypsin and the effect of the -isomerized l-aspartic acid 115 on the unit-cell formation.

concentrated to 10 mg mlÀ1 by use of Microsep 3K tubes (Filtron) and dialyzed against 150 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM MES, pH 6.5. The bdellastasin±trypsin complex was crystallized by vapour diffusion using the `sitting-drop' method (McPherson, 1989). One crystal of the porcine -trypsin±bdellastasin complex was obtained after 17 months in droplets containing 3 ml of protein solution and 1 ml of reservoir solution (4.0 M sodium formate, pH 7.7) equilibrated at 294 K against 1 ml of reservoir solution. This crystal was rod shaped and had maximal dimensions of 0.12 Â 0.17 Â 0.32 mm.
2.2. Data collection

2. Experimental
2.1. Crystallization

Diffraction data were recorded at 293 K from one crystal of the porcine -trypsin±bdellastasin complex with a 30 cm MAR Research imaging-plate detector system mounted on an RU-200 Rigaku rotating-anode X-ray generator operated at 5.4 kW (graphite-monochromated Cu K radiation, ! = Ê 1.54 A). Images were processed using the MOSFLM package (Leslie, 1994) and data were scaled and merged with routines implemented in the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The data-processing statistics are summarized in Table 1.
2.3. Structure solution and refinement

Recombinant bdellastasin was expressed in the yeast S. cerevisiae and puri®ed as described previously (Moser et al., 1998). Lyophilized porcine pancreatic trypsin type IX (E.C. 3.4.21.4) was purchased from Sigma. This -trypsin was inhibited by a slight molar excess of bdellastasin in 100 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM MES, pH 6.5 for 1 h at 277 K,

The structure of the porcine -trypsin±bdellastasin complex was solved by Patterson search techniques using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The orientation and position of the porcine -trypsin±bdellastasin complex in the tetragonal crystal were determined using the structure of porcine pancreatic trypsin together with the bdellastasin fragment

28±57 (PDB accession code 1c9p; Rester et al., 1999). The Ê rotational search using data to 3.5 A gave a single solution with a correlation value of 0.277, compared with 0.122 for the next highest peak. After applying the indicated rotation of  = À1.04,  = 64.54,  = 347.9 , translation functions were calculated for the two enantiomorphic space groups P41212 and P43212. In P43212, the highest peak was 1.05 times higher than the next one (correlation coef®cient 0.333; R value 49.5%), while in P41212 the translational search showed one solution with a correlation value of 0.639 over 0.391 for the next highest peak (R value 37.6%), identifying the latter space group as the correct one. After applying the suggested translation of Áx = 0.2027, Áy = 0.3549, Áz = 0.2357, rigid-body ®tting with AMoRe brought the R value down to 33.4%, while the correlation coef®cient increased to 0.722. The structure of the porcine -trypsin±bdellastasin complex È was re®ned with X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992a,b) using the Engh & Huber (1991) parameters. Rfree validation was based on a subset of 10% of re¯ections omitted during the entire re®nement procedure. Starting with the properly rotated and translated model of porcine -trypsin in complex with bdellastasin fragment 28±57, conventional Powell energy minimization and individual B-factor re®nement against data Ê in the resolution range 8.0±2.7 A was carried out. In later stages of re®nement, the maximum-likelihood algorithm implemented in the program CNS Development Version 0.3 (Brunger et al., 1998) was used. Each round of re®nement was followed alternately with manual model re®tting using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). The ®nal re®nement data are listed in Table 2.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Quality of the final model

The structure of porcine -trypsin complexed with bdellastasin has been re®ned to a crystallographic R value of 19.1 Ê and an Rfree of 24.8 at 2.7 A resolution. Model building allowed the positioning of 221 trypsin residues, ten out of 59 bdellastasin residues, 85 water molecules and one sodium ion. Apart from a few surface-located side chains and the loop segment Ser146±Gly148, the trypsin moiety is almost completely de®ned in the electron-density map. On the other hand, the N-terminal and most of the C-terminal subdomain of the inhibitor, except for the primary binding loop from residues Leu31±Lys36 and parts of the secondary binding loop, lack any electron density, implying disorder relative to the trypsin moiety. A geometry check revealed that 81.2 and 18.8% of all non-glycine and non-proline residues lie within the most favoured and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively, as de®ned by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993).

(a) Stereo ribbon diagram of the BDA2 complex formed between porcine -trypsin (blue) and bdellastasin (red) in trypsin standard orientation, i.e. with the active-site cleft facing the viewer and a bound inhibitor chain running across the surface from left to right, and (b) rotated 90 around a vertical axis. Yellow connections indicate disul®de bridges and the calcium ion is shown as a grey ball. (c) The BDA3 complex formed between porcine -trypsin (blue) and bdellastasin (red). Apart from the Leu31±Lys36 proteinase-binding loop of bdellastasin, which can be traced by electron density, the inhibitor is based on model building. These ®gures were produced with BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997) and Raster3D (Merritt & Murphy, 1994).

Previously, the antistasin-type cysteine-rich serine proteinase inhibitor bdellastasin had been crystallized in complex with bovine -trypsin in the monoclinic space group P21 (BDA1) and in complex with porcine -trypsin in the tetragonal space group P43212 (BDA2; Rester et al., 1999). Here, we describe the porcine -trypsin±bdellastasin complex structure in a new crystal form belonging to the enantiomorphic space group P41212 (BDA3). A comparison of the porcine trypsin molecules of the BDA2 and BDA3 Ê complexes reveals an r.m.s. deviation of 0.38 A for  Ê for all 223 C positions, compared with 0.58 A 223 C atoms for the best de®ned bovine -trypsin molecule (D) of the BDA1 complex. In all BDA complexes, interactions between the inhibitor and the proteinase are restricted to the Cterminal subdomain of bdellastasin and particularly to the primary binding loop (residues 30±38). The reactive-site loop of bdellastasin in the BDA3 complex from Leu31 (P4) to Lys36 (P2H ) is in direct contact with trypsin and binds to its active site in a substrate-like manner, i.e. with a main-chain conformation and intermolecular hydrogen-bond interactions similar to those seen in other canonically binding proteinase inhibitors (Bode & Huber, 1992). The relative orientation of the de®ned

bdellastasin segments in the BDA3 complex to trypsin is almost identical to the orientation observed in the BDA1 and BDA2 complexes, with virtually no differences in the mainchain conformation within the binding-loop region. However, in the new crystal form the bdellastasin molecule cannot adopt the brick-shaped structure reported for the BDA1 and BDA2 complexes (Fig. 2a,b), i.e. with a stretched arrangement of the C-terminal and the N-terminal subdomain (Rester et al., 1999). Owing to the tight crystal packing in the new crystal form, the ¯exible N-terminal subdomain of bdellastasin must be rotated by about 90 with respect to the N-terminal subdomain of the BDA1 complex (Fig. 2c) to ®t into a cavity formed by symmetry-related trypsin molecules. This wedge-shaped structure is in agreement with the assumption that the N-terminal subdomain can rotate as a rigid body along the linker segment Ser29±Leu31 with respect to the C-terminal subdomain (Rester et al., 1999).
3.3. A sodium ion occupying the calcium-binding site of porcine b-trypsin

During the re®nement procedure, the presence of a bound sodium ion at the calcium-binding site of the porcine -trypsin molecule in the tetragonal crystals of space group P41212 (BDA3) became evident. Signi®cant positive electron density

at the +6' contouring level (Fig. 3a) clearly indicated the presence of a metal ion at the beginning of the re®nement. However, a calcium ion entailed a negative electron density below À4' after positional re®nement (Fig. 3a) and a B value Ê of 109.9 A2 after individual B-factor re®nement. Therefore, the positive electron density was interpreted as a sodium ion according to the crystallization conditions and structural characteristics. The sodium ion in the BDA3 structure has an occupancy of Ê 1.0 and a B value of 36.3 A2 compared with an average B value Ê 2 for its ligands. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the sodium of 31.9 A Ê ion is complexed by the carbonyl O atoms of Asn72 (2.3 A, Ê for the calcium ion in the BDA2 struccompared with 2.3 A Ê Ê ture) and Val75 (2.4 A, compared with 2.4 A in BDA2) and by 41 Ê the side-chain O atoms Glu70 O (2.5 A, compared with Ê Ê Ê in BDA2) and Glu80 O42 (2.4 A, compared with 2.7 A in 2.4 A BDA2) de®ning the central plane. The two axial ligands opposing each other in the octahedron are Glu77 and a more Ê Ê distant water molecule H2O32 (4.7 A, compared with 3.4 A for + H2O69 in BDA2). Moreover, the Na position is shifted out of Ê the central plane by about 0.4 A towards Glu77, allowing the + Ê Na to make direct contacts with Glu77 O41 (2.8 A, compared Ê in BDA2), i.e. different to the `classical' waterwith 4.5 A mediated Ca2+ position in the BDA2 structure (Rester et al., 1999). Furthermore, the side chain of Glu77 has moved by Ê about 1.5 A towards the sodium ion. This movement is re¯ected by larger shifts of up Ê to 1.1 A for the six C atoms of loop segment Asn72±Glu77, compared with an Ê r.m.s. deviation of 0.38 A for the 233 C atoms of the entire porcine -trypsin molecules in the bdellastasin complexes of the enantiomorphic space groups P41212 and P43212. The sodium ion in the calciumbinding site of porcine -trypsin displays some larger rearrangements compared with calcium and, owing to the close Glu77 and the distant water molecule H2O32, exhibits a tetragonal pyramidal coordination, in contrast to tetragonal bipyramidal coordination (Bode & Schwager, 1975).

In the porcine -trypsin±bdellastasin structure of the tetragonal space group P41212 (BDA3), loop segment Leu114± Arg117 of the trypsin molecule can easily be traced in the 2Fo À Fc Fourier map (Fig. 4a). This loop segment is well de®ned and makes no direct crystal contacts to symmetry-related molecules. The electron density drawn at the 1' contouring level clearly indicates the presence of the naturally occurring l-asparagine residue at position 115.

In contrast, in the porcine -trypsin±bdellastasin complex of enantiomorphic space group P43212 (BDA2; Rester et al., 1999), residue 115 had been re®ned as l-isoaspartate (Ias115; Fig. 4b). The electron density, accounting for a short side chain and a quite long separation from the following  C atom, is neither in agreement with an l-Asn or l-Asp, nor with an d-Asn or d-Asp, but clearly indicates the presence of a -isomerized l-aspartic acid for this trypsin residue. This l-isoaspartic acid presumably results from a spontaneous deamidation accompanied by simultaneous isomerization reactions via a ®ve-membered succinimide ring. The Fo À Fc difference map is relatively featureless for the l-isoaspartic acid and all crystallographic and stereochemical parameters are acceptable. Ias115 juxtaposes segment Thr144±Gly148 of a symmetry-related molecule (Fig. 4b), thereby making tight crystal contacts. The side-chain O atoms Ias115 O1 and O2 are within hydrogen-bonding distance (2.9 and Ê 3.3 A) of the hydrogen-bond donors Ser147 N and Ser146 N, respectively. Furthermore, Ias115 O2 is linked to Thr144 O through the two hydrogenbonded water molecules H2O10 and H2O43, Leu114 O interacts with Lys145 N Ê (3.2 A), and Ser116 O is water-connected to Ser146 O. These crystal contacts would also be possible for d-Asp (Fig. 4c), as observed in the porcine trypsin±LDTI complex (Di Marco & Priestle, 1997). Apart from the missing water-bridged Ser116 O ÐSer146 O contact, the interaction pattern seems to be conserved, although the d-Asp115 O1ÐSer147 N Ê (2.6 A) and d-Asp115 O2ÐSer146 N Ê (2.5 A) interactions are slightly shorter (Table 3). It is thus tempting to speculate that the formation of this crystal form is associated with the deamidation and racemization of l-Asn115 to d-Asp115 and is particularly favoured for the isomerized product l-isoaspartate.

(b) The structure around Asn115 of the BDA2 complex, interpreted and re®ned as an l-isoaspartate (Ias115), is shown in orange, while part of a symmetry-related trypsin molecule making hydrogen bonds with Ias115 and with water molecules (blue balls) is shown in green. The Fo À Fc difference map (+3', yellow) was calculated with coordinates from which residues 113±117 had been omitted. The ®nal 2Fo À Fc electron-density map contoured at 1.2' is shown in light blue. Hydrogen bonds are indiacted as yellow lines. (c) Stereo superposition of the structure around Ias115 (orange) with d-Asp115 (blue) and the corresponding loop segments 144±147 of the symmetry-related trypsin molecules.

These ®gures were produced with BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997) and Raster3D (Merritt & Murphy, 1994).

Three porcine -trypsin molecules in complex with macromolecular inhibitors have previously been crystallized in the tetragonal space group P43212. These are the two porcine -trypsin±LDTI complex structures LDTI1 and LDTI2 [PDB accession codes 1an1 (Di Marco & Priestle, 1997) and 1ldt (Stubbs et al., 1997), respectively] and the porcine -trypsin± bdellastasin complex structure BDA2 (PDB accession code 1c9p; Rester et al., 1999). For LDTI1, residue Asn115 has been re®ned as d-Asp115, for LDTI2 the interpretation of the electron density at residue 115 is consistent with d-Asp (M. Stubbs, personal communication) and for BDA2 the electron density clearly indicates the presence of a -isomerized l-aspartic acid. Interestingly, the unit-cell parameters

(1997) model for the crystallization Priestle (1997) process of porcine -trypsin in complex with macromolecular inhibitors in the tetragonal are nearly identical for these three complexes and the crysspace group P43212 which is similar to the model of the early tallization parameters are similar (Table 4). The similarity of stage of crystallization of lysozyme (Igarashi et al., 1999): the these complex structures is re¯ected by an r.m.s. deviation of driving force for crystallization seems to be the formation of hydrophobic interactions between the trypsin molecules. The succinimide formation in residue Asn115, connected with the disappearance of an ÐNH2 group on the protein surface (Fig. 1), results in a lower solubility of the succinimide-115 trypsin, as observed for succinimide hen egg-white lysozyme (Miyawaki et al., 1996). Consequently, by lowering the protein solubility, succinimide-115 trypsin seems to play a crucial role as a `transition-state intermediate' in crystal nucleation and crystal growth. Consequently, owing to the reorientation of the side chain in position 115 and the spatial orientation of the isomerization product Ias115 and the racemization product d-Asp115 (Fig. 4c), the loop segment Leu114±Ser116 is able to form favourable electrostatic interactions with segment Thr144± Gly148 of another -trypsin molecule, thus tightly clamping the trypsin molecules together.
