Abstract The IV-@-chlorphenylsulfonyl)dithiocarbimatodisulfide [-S(S)C=N-S(O*)-C6H4--Cl] 22- has been prepared from the corresponding dithiocarbimate [S2C=N-S(02)-C6H4-Cl12by oxidation with 12. A complete X-ray structure has been carried out on the bis(tetraphenylarsonium) salt. The bond length of the central disulfide group S-S is 2.047 A, the dihedral angle C-S-S-C is 80.8". The characteristics of the disulfide group concerning the S-S dihedral angle are investigated by ab initio SCF MO calculations using different basis-sets. A point-charge model has been introduced to simulate crystal field effects.

A two-electron oxidized dithiocarbamate cation 2 has not been isolated but its existence was postulated [9]. On the other hand, thiuram disulfides 1 can easily be prepared from dithiocarbamates with iodine or bromine in ethanol and play an important role in industrial processes and biological systems [ 10-121. Nevertheless there are relatively few reports on structural studies or metal complexes of thiuram disulfide ligands [13, 141. Recently we reported on the electrochemical oxidative dimerization reactions [ 15, 161 2[S2C=C(CN)2]2-[(NC)2C=C(S)S-S(S)C=C(CN)2]23 2 [S(0)C=C(CN)2]22- + 2e(4) + 2e(3)

Introduction Dithiocarbamates and related chelating ligands YCS2"_ (n = 1, 2) frequently stabilize metallic centres in unusually high oxidation states and also have a propensity for stabilizing novel stereochemical configurations, unusual mixed oxidation states and intermediate spin states [2-6]. As covalency and charge distribution seem insufficient to explain the exceptional ability of the 1 ,l dithiolate ligands to stabilize metal ions in formal high oxidation states, sulfur-sulfur interactions are discussed as formal electron-donating mechanisms

X-ray structures of (AsPh4)23 and (AsPh4)24*H20 revealed anions consisting of two mutually perpendicular planes of the monomer fragments linked by adisulfidegroup [15, 161. During our investigation on new dithiocarbimates based on sulfonamides [ 1, 171 we observed the oneelectron oxidation (5) followed by the rather fast chemical radical-dimerization (6) (ECi, mechanism) by use of cyclic voltammetry [18]. On continuation of the anodic scan an intramolecular cyclization occurs which involves sulfur formation (7). The products have been identified by mass spectroscopy after generation at a constant potential. [S2C=N-S(02)-C6H.+-X125 + t e(5)

Ab Initio Calculations Ab initio calculations were performed on a CYBER 995 E with NOS-VE operating system and an IBM-MO-SCF program [25]. For all calculations the model system [H-N=C(S)S-S(S)C=N-HI*(9) was introduced with available bond lengths and angles from the X-ray crystal structure of 7c and H-N distances of 1 .Ol A. Calculations on free 9 have been carried out using a rigid geometry at various dihedral S-S angles of 70, 90, 120, 150 and 180' and a minimal basis-set [26] as well as a double-zeta basis [(H; 6s), (N, C; 9s 3p), (S; 13s lop) contracted to (H; 2s), (N, C; 4s 2p), (S; 6s 5p)] [26].

Single crystals of (AsP~)~~c*H~O suitable for Xray structure analysis have been obtained and the results are presented below. In molecular compounds R-S-S-R as well as in the negatively charged species 3 and 4 dihedral angles are usually close to 90" [ 15, 16, 19-221. In order to rule out the influences of negative charge and crystal packing on the molecular structures of 3 and 7 we investigated the nature of the S-S bond by using an ab initio molecular orbital method for the model system [H-N=C(S)S-S(S)C=N-HI*(9) with (a) a minimal basis set, (b) double zeta plus polarization on S atoms, (c) minimal basis plus pointcharge contribution and (d) minimal basis plus polarization for anionic sulfur atoms plus pointcharge contribution, based on crystal structure analysis.

Experimental Preparation of (AsPh4)2[Cl-C6H~ -S(O,)N=C(S)S-]2.H20 N@-chlorphenylsulfonyl)-dithiocarbimate The was prepared according to the literature [ 11. A mixture of 4.0 g K25c.H20 and 1.34 g iodine in 100 ml ethylacetate was stirred at room temperature for 10 min. After filtration of precipitated KI the solution was slowly evaporated to give a yellow powder which was dissolved in 30 ml acetone. To this solution 4.0 g AsPh,Cl in 40 ml acetone were added slowly. On addition of 500 ml water, a solid white precipitate was yielded, which was recrystallized from acetone/ HzO. The TG curve (Netzsch STA 426, N,-atmosphere, reference: A1203) of the title compound shows one distinct peak due to the loss of one mole Hz0 at 200 "C; decomposition is monitored at T = 235 "C.

In 7c there are several alterations within the C& fragments when compared to SC. The decreased bond angle S-C-S (109" in 7c versus 120" in SC) is obviously caused by a less pronounced repulsion between S atoms in the CS2 units induced by a decrease of negative charge located on the disulfide atoms Sl in 7c. While in SC the C-S bond lengths are of the same magnitude (1.70; 1.74 A) they are different in

7c. The average value of 1.80 A for Sl-C corresponds to a C-S single bond while the C-S2 bond lengths are unusually short (av. 1.677 A) [29]. The other features concerning the monomere units in 7c are quite similar to 5c. There are two distinct planar arrangements of atoms in each part of 7c (Table 3). The two planes are oriented nearly perpendicular to each other and give rise to conjugation involving the SOZ groups [ 11. According to Koch and Moffitt such a conformation of compounds containing SO* groups can be described as `case I of conjugation' referring to the n-system of the phenyl ring and the lone-pair located on N,2 while the orientation of the n-system of the S?CN moiety with respect to SOZ is of `case II' [30]. The case I-type should favour strong conjugation with weakened oxy-sulfur bonds while case II conjugation is considered to be not very pronounced.
TABLE 4. Energy, Mulliken charge distribution

The bond angles Cl-S1 l-S12 and C2-S12-Sll in 7c indicate that the outer electrons on sulfur atoms Sl 1 and S12 are roughly sp3 hybridized. As reviewed by Abrahams the valency angles for two-bonded sulfur are normally tetrahedral or slightly less [31]. The observed S-S bond length corresponds to a Pauling value of 2.08 A for a pure single bond between divalent sulfur atoms [32]. The torsion angle Cl-S1 I-S12-C2 is 80.8'. Dihedral angles in molecules R-S-S-R are usually close to 90" [33, 341. This is believed to be in accordance with the optimum rr overlap of orbitals while an angle of 0' is associated with the maximum repulsion between nonbonding orbitals on sulfur atoms. Although in 7c there is considerable repulsion between anionic sulfur atoms a cis configuration is realized. The energies, charge densities on sulfur (disulfide atoms are denoted as S*) and overlap populations for the S-S bond of the investigated conformers of the free model system 9 are presented in Table 4 while the results of calculations on 9 including crystal field simulations are presented in Table 5. Figure 3 shows the relative energies for free 9 and 9 in the crystal field as function of the dihedral angle C-S-S-C. The results for free 9 (E) depend significantly of the basis-set which is applied. Although with the minimal basis as well as the double-zeta basis the minimum in energy is observed at IgO', the curve obtained with the extended basis is very smooth in the region 90 < C-S-S-C < 180' exhibiting a local minimum at 1 IO'. Well pronounced energy minima at 100 and 110' are observed on application of the point-charge model (N). Here an extension of the basis (inclusion of polarization functions on S) effects the energy minimum to occur at C-S-S-C = 100'. The overlap population for S-S is regarded as a rough indication for the bond strength between sulfur atoms in the disulfide group. The values as function of the S-S dihedral angle together with the charge densities on S and S* are depicted in Fig. 4. From inspection of Figs. 3 and 4 it can be seen that the energy minimum for the point-charge model with polarization functions coincides roughly with

This indicates that the point-charge model with polarization functions is the most appropriate one to describe the geometry of the molecule. The cis configuration is considered as the result of a careful balance between repulsion of negatively charged sulfur atoms and the overlap population in the S-S bond which could be attributed to hyperconjugation between C and S [35].
