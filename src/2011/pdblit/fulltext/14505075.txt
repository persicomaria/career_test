Abstract Three novel X-ray crystal structures for the DNA hexamer d(GGCGCC) in the B-form complexed to divalent cobalt, nickel and zinc ions have been ° determined to a resolution of 2.9­3.0 A. The structures were isomorphous and had five DNA strands and five metal cations per asymmetric unit. In all three cases, divalent metal cations were coordinated only to the terminal guanine residue at the N(7) position, with no metal ions binding to non-terminal guanine positions. Water molecules bound to the metal cations interacted with neighboring guanine residues 3¢ to the ones to which the cations were coordinated, affecting the propeller twist. Even though DNA occupied only about 35% of the unit cell volume, it is interesting that the few interactions involving the metal cations were sufficient to stabilize the crystal lattice. As well as lending support to the proposal that these metals do not coordinate to B-DNA in a stable manner, the results presented here also extend the crystallographic evidence for this phenomenon to the GGC and CGC sequences for all three metal cations.

Introduction
Several cobalt(II)-, nickel(II)- and zinc(II)-nucleotide X-ray crystallographic structures have been reported in the literature [1]. For single, unmodified purine nucleotide monophosphates these include Co2+-5¢-GMP and Co2+-5¢-IMP [2], Co2+-5¢-dGMP [3], Co2+-5¢-dIMP [4], Ni2+-5¢-AMP [5], Ni2+-5¢-GMP [6], Ni2+-5¢-IMP [7] and Ni2+-5¢-dGMP [3]. In these complexes the metal is bound to the N(7) position of the purine, with five water molecules completing an octahedral coordination to give the general formula M(5¢-NMP)(H2O)5.nH2O. Interactions are observed between water molecules of the hydration sphere of the metal and oxygen atoms of the nucleotide phosphate groups and the O(6) or N(6) position of the purines. The Zn2+-5¢-IMP structure [8] has the zinc atom bound to the N(7) position and also directly to three phosphate groups of three neighboring residues, so that the metal has a tetrahedral coordination geometry, the whole structure being polymeric. The single pyrimidine nucleotide monophosphatemetal complexes Co2+-5¢-CMP [9], Co2+-5¢-UMP [10] and Zn2+-5¢-CMP [11] all crystallize as polymeric structures. The cytosine nucleotides display metal binding via N(3), two oxygen atoms of different phosphate groups on other moieties, one water molecule and a weak interaction with O(2) to give the metal cation an approximately tetrahedral coordination. The uracil nucleotide complex only shows binding to four phosphate groups and two water molecules, giving cobalt an octahedral coordination. More recently, cobalt(II)-, nickel(II)- and zinc(II)deoxyoligonucleotide structures have become available. The first involved CoCl2 soaked into a crystal of Z-DNA [12]. Here, cobalt cations bind to the N(7) position of guanine moieties both at the ends of the helix and within it. In the same report, another alternating GC structure was solved in which a distorted B-DNA conformation was observed next to a bound drug molecule. Interestingly, cobalt did not bind to guanine residues within this

near-normal B-DNA region. Based on model studies, the authors proposed that cobalt could not form a stable interaction with the guanine N(7) position within a B-DNA helix because it cannot maintain an octahedral coordination sphere due to clashes with the base at its 5¢ side. Recently, several structures [13, 14, 15] have been examined wherein the cobalt atom has been shown to bind only at the N(7) position of guanine residues. It is difficult to make concrete conclusions about whether cobalt binds to guanine positions within a sequence of DNA that has the B conformation based on these latter studies because there are no guanine residues positioned within a segment of B-DNA due to fraying of the ends. The first deoxyoligonucleotide crystallized in the presence of nickel(II) [16, 17] was d(CGTATATACG), which exhibited a B-like conformation except at the terminal residues which were found to interact instead with neighboring strands to form G-C-G base triplets. Nickel atoms were only bound to the guanine residues and showed octahedral coordination reminiscent of the single nucleotide studies. The crystal structure of nickel and d(CGTGTACACG) showed nickel only bound to guanine residues in terminal or extrahelical positions [18]. This lent support to the hypothesis that in oligonucleotides having the B-DNA conformation, divalent metal cations similar to nickel interact specifically with guanine residues in unusual conformations or residues located at the 5¢ end, as had previously been proposed for cobalt. This was also confirmed with zinc(II) using the sequence d(CGCAATTGCG) [19], zinc only binding to the guanine residues at the terminal end of the B-DNA region or in extrahelical positions. In this work, we have undertaken to examine the effects of metal cation coordination to d(GGCGCC), having crystallized the sequence in the presence of

cobalt(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II). This sequence crystallizes in a B-DNA conformation and does not display fraying in the presence of these metal ions.

Materials and methods
Crystallization and data collection The self-complementary deoxyhexanucleotide d(GpGpCpGpCpC) ´ was obtained from AlphaDNA (Montreal, Quebec). The sequence was synthesized using the phosphoramidite method and purified using reverse phase HPLC, followed by removal of the DMT group and desalting by ethanol precipitation. Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion from hanging drops. The cobalt complex crystal was grown at room temperature in a 6-lL drop containing 2 mM hexamer, 50 mM of the sodium salt of N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-3-aminopropanesulfonate (TAPS)HCl (pH 8.1), 25 mM CoCl2 and 2% glycerol equilibrated against a 1 mL reservoir containing 50 mM TAPS-HCl (pH 8.1), 25 mM CoCl2 and 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD). The nickel complex crystal was grown at 4 °C in a 3-lL drop containing 2 mM hexamer, 40 mM TAPS-HCl (pH 8.0), 3.75 mM NiCl2 and 10% MPD equilibrated against a 0.4 mL reservoir containing 40 mM TAPS-HCl (pH 8.0), 3.75 mM NiCl2 and 35% MPD. The zinc complex crystal was grown at 4 °C in a 2-lL drop containing 2 mM hexamer, 25 mM TAPS-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.25 mM ZnCl2 and 1% MPD equilibrated against a 0.4 mL reservoir containing 40 mM TAPS-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.25 mM ZnCl2 and 30% MPD. The crystals grew over a period of 3­5 days as square prisms, having either one or both ends shaped as square pyramids in the case of cobalt and zinc, and football shapes having four sides in the case of nickel. Dimensions were typically about 0.2·0.2·0.4 mm3. Preparation of the crystals for data collection included transferring the crystals to a cryoprotectant that consisted of the mother liquor with a higher concentration of MPD (55%) and no hexamer followed by flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected at T=110 K with a 1° rotation per frame at BioCARS beamline 14-BMD. The diffraction data were processed and merged using the HKL package [20]. The space group was P4,2,2 for all three complexes. Data processing statistics are given in Table 1.

717 Structure determination and refinement It was apparent that the DNA crystallized in a B-like conformation because strong stacking reflections were observed at approximately ° 3.4 A resolution on the collected frames. The unit cell parameters and space group were similar to those that were observed for a similar structure of the same sequence in the absence of bound metal ions (NDB entry BD0040) [21]. This structure was used as a starting point for refinement of all three of the structures described here. Refinement was carried out using X-PLOR 3.851 [22] using the nucleic acid specific parameter files that treat all hydrogen atoms explicitly [23]. The diffraction data were first split into a working set containing 90% of the reflections and a reference set with 10% of the reflections. Step 1 was a rigid body refinement, the groups being two duplexes and one single strand. This was followed by a rigid body refinement with each single strand of DNA being considered a group. R-factors at each step are reported for each of the three complexes (Fig. 1). Step 2 consisted of a simulated annealing protocol. Here, B-DNA restraints for base planarity, sugar pucker and Watson­Crick hydrogen bonding were imposed. During this and all subsequent refinement steps, B-factors were refined by groups with a Bmin limit. Both the FO)FC and 2FO)FC electron density maps showed large spherical areas of density adjacent to the N(7) positions of each of the five terminal guanine residues. The distance between the N(7) atom of each of these guanine residues and the center of the spherical region was reasonable for a nitrogen­metal interaction. For step 3 of refinement, a cobalt, nickel or zinc cation was placed in the center of each spherical region, depending on the complex. This was followed by an energy minimization of the model that included the metal ions. The resulting difference electron density maps showed extra densities around metal cations. This was interpreted as due to water in the metal ions' coordination spheres. Because of the limited resolution of the data, it was not possible to determine the placement of the water molecules and thus octahedral coordination for the metal ions was assumed. Step 4 involved placing five water molecules around each metal with idealized octahedral geometry, energy minimization and B-group refinement with the hydration shell considered as a group. Step 5 was a fitting round followed by energy minimization. This and all further steps imposed resolution-dependent weighting and a bulk solvent correction. In step 6, another fitting round was performed followed by energy minimization. Steps 7 and 8 were energy minimization steps without Watson­Crick hydrogen bonding restraints. It was not deemed justifiable to add water molecules outside of the metal hydration shells due to the low resolution of the data. After completion of each structure, the metal cation sites were verified by removing them (and their associated water molecules), then running a simulated annealing protocol with bulk solvent correction and B-group refinement. In all cases, there was a significant increase in the R-factor (Rwork between 0.251 and 0.277, Rfree between 0.297 and 0.327, removing two metal cation sites at a time). As well, FO)FC and 2FO)FC maps showed strong density where the metal cations were missing. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Nucleic Acid Database as entries BD0063 (cobalt), BD0064 (nickel) and BD0065 (zinc).

Results
All three structures have five single strands of DNA in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2), giving the unit cell a total of 20 double helices. Note that one of the single strands in the asymmetric unit lies such that its complementary strand is generated by a crystallographic two-fold axis. Each duplex has six Watson­Crick base pairs with no bases being extrahelical. The duplexes are stacked endto-end into continuous columns with negative twist at the interhelical base pair step. The columns are arranged diagonally within the ab plane. When viewed along the c axis, the helices are seen to interact with each other at 90° angles, with the phosphate backbone of one duplex interacting, via the metal complex, with the major groove of the other duplex (Fig. 3). Overall, this arrangement is similar to the structure of the same

Fig. 3 The interaction between duplexes in the crystal is mediated by metal cations which interact with guanine residues at position N(7) in the major groove of one duplex and phosphate oxygen atoms of the other duplex via the metal cation's hydration sphere.

sequence reported by Vargason et al. [21] that was crystallized in the presence of spermine. In each of the three structures, five divalent metal cations were located per asymmetric unit. Five water molecules surround each metal cation for a total of 25 in each asymmetric unit. These metal cations are bound to the N(7) positions of each terminal guanine residue (see figure in Supplementary material). In each case, there is an interaction between a water molecule from the metal atom's hydration sphere and the O(6) atom of the same guanine residue. As well, there are interactions between water molecules and phosphate oxygen atoms from neighboring DNA strands (Fig. 4). This is the case with metal cations coordinated at positions G1, G7, G19 and G25. The other metal cation at position G13 does not come into close enough contact with any neighboring helices and therefore these interactions are absent. In each case, metal ion locations were positively verified (see figure in Supplementary material). Helical parameters for the duplexes were calculated using FREEHELIX98 [24]. Because there are two and one half duplexes per asymmetric unit, parameters were calculated for three duplexes separately (two duplexes plus the single strand with its symmetry mate), then averaged. In general, there were only minor differences between the three structures and that of the Vargason et al. model [21] that was used as a starting point and all of the values fall within the normal range for BDNA except propeller twist [25], which has a somewhat less negative value. We also calculate that the model with spermine has 10.38 residues per helical turn whereas the cobalt, nickel and zinc structures have

10.60, 10.61 and 10.65 residues per turn, respectively. This would suggest that the crystal packing in the presence of divalent metal cations induces a more compact structure relative to packing with spermine in this case. It is not certain, however, whether this effect is due solely to replacing spermine with metal cations because the data for the crystals with the metal cations were collected at 110 K, whereas the data for the structure with spermine were collected at room temperature. Another significant feature is the interaction of the metal cation-bound water with the O(6) atom of the guanine residue 3¢ to the one to which the cation is coordinated. The hydrogen bonding seems to stabilize a mean propeller twist of ­5.40±3.25° (n=18, mean taken over all base pairs having a coordinated metal cation). This is in contrast with base pairs having no coordinated metal cations, which show a mean propeller twist of ­1.06±4.60° (n=36).

Discussion
All three of the structures reported here share a similar packing arrangement to that of the same sequence crystallized in the presence of spermine [21]. Whereas the latter structure is stabilized by spermine, our structures show the stabilizing function of spermine being effectively replaced by the cobalt, nickel or zinc atoms that bind to guanine residues G1, G7, G19 and G25 to stabilize the interaction between the major groove and the neighboring phosphate backbones. In the case of spermine, the molecule often lies along the entire length of the major groove, where it stabilizes the interaction with

719

neighboring phosphate backbones. It is interesting that the metal cations are able to stabilize the crystal lattice even though they only interact with the neighboring phosphate backbones at four distinct points. Our structures show hydrogen bonding between the metals' hydration sphere at position G19 and oxygen atoms of the neighboring phosphate backbone, whereas there is no spermine bound in the major groove near this position in the corresponding structure. A structure of the same sequence crystallized in the 3+ presence of Co(NH3)6 was also recently reported (NDB entries BD0039 and BD0050) [21, 26]. This structure showed several differences to the ones crystallized in the presence of the divalent metal cations. One cobalt atom was observed to cross-link two guanine residues of neighboring helices by coordinating both N(7) positions. The near-octahedral coordination sphere of the cobalt atom was completed by four NH3 molecules. Additional stabilization of the interaction between neighboring duplexes was via a magnesium cation octahedrally coordinated to six water molecules, which formed hydrogen bonds within the major groove of one duplex and phosphate oxygen atoms of neighboring duplexes. No cobalt cations were reported bound to terminal guanine residues besides those involved in the cross-link. In our study the data have a relatively low resolution, which is not unusual with DNA that packs in a similar manner. The limitations in resolution are primarily caused by a highly disordered solvent content, which may actually have an advantage since the results might better approximate biological conditions. We estimate that all three crystals have a solvent content of nearly 65%. Even considering these limitations, the results are clear and unambiguous, supporting the suggestion that these transition metal cations do not bind B-type DNA except at terminal guanine positions. It is noteworthy that, of the five metal cations present in each structure, only four participate in interactions between neighboring helices and that this is sufficient to stabilize such a sparse crystal lattice. To summarize the studies of divalent metal cation binding to guanine within B-DNA sequences thus far: cobalt does not bind CGC [12], nickel does not bind TGT [18] and zinc does not bind TGC [19]. The present results show that none of these metal cations will bind the central guanine residues in GGC or CGC sequences either. These results are consistent with the proposal [12] that it is a general phenomenon that metal cations such as this do not bind B-DNA in a stable manner. This is also the reason that these metal cations can cause a decrease in the melting temperature of DNA [27, 28], fraying being observed in several structures involving these cations. It should be noted that in none of the studies involving these metal cations are there any adenine residues at terminal positions of a B-DNA region. One would expect that coordination would also occur in this case, though the stability of the complex would be predicted to be lower [29].

DNA conformations stabilized by divalent transition metal cations include Z-DNA [30, 31] and M-DNA [28, 32]. We do not believe that these structures represent the M-DNA conformation because the pH at which these complexes crystallized is likely too low and the results do not seem to explain many of the phenomena observed in this conformation. These results are consistent with the proposal that the left-handed Z-DNA conformation is stabilized by metal cations partly because they only interact with guanine N(7) positions that are more exposed than in B-DNA. In the appropriate sequence, these metal cations would thus favor the Z-DNA conformation.
