Abstract 1H-Siladigermirene R4SiGe2 (2a) and 1H-trigermirene R4Ge3 (2b) (R = SiMetBu2) with a Ge@Ge double bond were synthesized by the reaction of tetrachlorodigermane RGeCl2­GeCl2R with dilithiosilane R2SiLi2 and dilithiogermane R2GeLi2, respectively. The skel° etal Ge@Ge double bond of 2a is trans-bent (51.0(2)°) with a bond distance of 2.2429(6) A. The reaction of both 2a and 2b with CH2Cl2 resulted in the formation of unusual four-membered ring compounds 5a and 5b as a result of a ring expansion reaction. 1H-Trisilirene 7a and 3H-disilagermirene 7b with an Si@Si double bond also smoothly reacted with CH2Cl2 to yield the four-membered ring systems 8a and 8b, respectively.

1. Introduction The research area of the cyclopropene analogs of heavier group 14 elements of the type cyclo-[R2E 0 ­E(R)@E(R)] (E, E 0 = Si, Ge, Sn; R = bulky silyl substituent) is becoming an increasingly attractive field of modern organometallic chemistry [1]. The major accomplishments in such chemistry have been made by the research groups of Sekiguchi, Kira, and Wiberg, who have reported the synthesis of heavy cyclopropenes of Si, Ge, and Sn atoms [2]: trigermirenes Ge3 [2a­c], trisilirenes Si3 [2d­g], and tristannirene Sn3 [2h]. In 2000, we prepared the first hybrid compounds containing two different group 14 elements, 3H- and 1H-disilagermirenes GeSi2 [3a], and studied their particularly attractive chemistry, a result of the favorable combination of high ring strain and exceeding reactivity of the endocyclic E@E bond, which opened new unprecedented possibilities for the synthesis of a number of novel cyclic and

polycyclic organometallics [3b­k]. The recent fast progress in the field enabled us to claim the constitution of this new class of organometallic compounds, heavy cyclopropenes, in our preceding contribution [4]. However, until now no other representatives of heteronuclear heavy cyclopropenes (except for the above-mentioned 3H- and 1H-disilagermirenes GeSi2 [3a]) have been synthesized, although these compounds are expected to possess unusual promising properties. In this paper, we present the synthesis, full structural characterization, and unexpected reactivity of new representatives of the heavy cyclopropenes family, heteronuclear 1H-siladigermirene SiGe2 and homonuclear trigermirene Ge3, both featuring endocyclic Ge@Ge double bonds [5]. 2. Results and discussion Our first attempts to synthesize the new hybrid 1H-siladigermirene derivative R4SiGe2 (R = SiMetBu2) by the identical synthetic procedure to that of the previously reported 3H-disilagermirene R4GeSi2 [3a] were unsuccessful, because it required the preparation of tBu2MeSi­

GeX3 (X = Cl, Br) as one of the key starting materials (Scheme 1). We found that compounds of this type, tBu2MeSi­GeX3, are highly thermally unstable, in marked contrast to the stable tBu2MeSi­SiBr3, because of the higher tendency of the former to undergo a-elimination of tBu2MeSiX accompanied by the generation of dihalogermylenes X2Ge: (Scheme 1). This forced us to develop a new synthetic protocol for the synthesis of the desired 1H-siladigermirene derivative, using a 1,1,2,2-tetrahalodigermane unit as a starting building block for the subsequent design of the endocyclic Ge@Ge moiety. As such, tBu2MeSi­GeCl2­GeCl2­ SiMetBu2 (1a) was selected as the best candidate. The synthesis of 1a commenced from the preparation of (p-tolyl)3GeCl (50%), which was converted to (p-tolyl)3GeH (80%) followed by its lithiation and coupling with t Bu2MeSiBr to form tBu2MeSi­Ge(p-tolyl)3 (75%) (Scheme 2). The reaction of tBu2MeSi­Ge(p-tolyl)3 and an equivalent amount of CF3SO3H followed by subsequent treatment with NH4Cl produced tBu2MeSi­Ge(p-tolyl)2Cl (84%), which was reacted with Li resulting in the formation of the tetraaryldigermane derivative tBu2MeSi­Ge

(p-tolyl)2­Ge(p-tolyl)2­SiMetBu2 (67%). The final dearylation­chlorination of tBu2MeSi­Ge(p-tolyl)2­Ge(p-tolyl)2­ SiMetBu2 with HCl/AlCl3 provided the desired starting 1,1,2,2-tetrachlorodigermane 1a in 95% yield (Scheme 2). The corresponding 1,1,2,2-tetrabromodigermane tBu2MeSi ­GeBr2­GeBr2­SiMetBu2 (1b) was also synthesized by the t bromination of Bu2MeSi­Ge(p-tolyl)2­Ge(p-tolyl)2­ t SiMe Bu2 with HBr/AlBr3, albeit in a lower yield of 52% due to the partial decomposition of 1b at room temperature. Taking into account the intrinsic inclination of halosilylgermanes >Ge(X)SiR3 to undergo easy a-elimination of R3SiX to produce germylenes >Ge:, the stability of 1a is surprising. The composition of 1a was reliably established with a complete set of spectral and analytical data, and the crystal structure of 1a was determined by X-ray crystallography (Fig. 1). The Si1­Ge1­Ge1#­Si1# atom chain has the anticipated all-trans conformation resulting in a characteristic zigzag shape of the molecule with normal bond distances. One should note that only a couple of examples of R3Si­GeCl2­GeCl2­SiR3 type compounds have been prepared and structurally characterized:

(Me3Si)3Si­GeCl2­GeCl2­Si(SiMe3)3 [6] and tBu3Si­ GeCl2­GeCl2­SitBu3 [7]. However, in both these cases the structural refinement suffered from either disorder [6] or co-crystallization with other compounds [7]. The reaction of 1a with 1,1-dilithiosilane (tBu2MeSi)2SiLi2 [8] in toluene cleanly resulted in the formation of a couple of products, the desired tetrakis(di-tert-butylmethylsilyl)-1H-siladigermirene (tBu2MeSi)4SiGe2 (2a) (26%) and tetrakis(di-tert-butylmethylsilyl)disilene (tBu2MeSi)2Si@Si(SiMetBu2)2 (3a) [9] in a 2:1 ratio (Scheme 3). Interestingly, among several possible products of this reaction, namely 1,4-disila-2,3-digermabuta-1,3-diene, 2,4disila-1,3-digermabicyclo[1.1.0]butane, and 1H-siladigermirene, only the last compound was formed. The two compounds, dark-red 1H-siladigermirene 2a and deep-blue disilene 3a [9], were separated by column chromatography (SiO2, hexane) in a glovebox followed by recrystallization from pentane. The possible reaction pathway might include the initial formation of 2,3-dichlorosiladigermirane (4a) followed by the fast Li­Cl exchange reaction between 4a

and a second molecule of (tBu2MeSi)2SiLi2 [10], leading to formation of 2a and 3a in the experimentally observed 2:1 ratio (Scheme 3). The 1H-siladigermirene 2a is the first representative of hybrid heavy cyclopropenes of SiGe2 composition featuring a skeletal Ge@Ge double bond; that is, 2a belongs also to the class of the cyclic digermenes [2a­c,3i]. The NMR spectra of 2a are rather simple, reflecting its symmetrical structure: only two sets of signals were observed for both Me and tBu groups in 1H and 13C NMR spectra. The 29 Si NMR spectrum revealed three resonances at À110.6, 5.8, and 40.8 ppm: the most upfield signal at À110.6 ppm was in the reasonable range for an sp3-Si atom in the three-membered ring, whereas the other two signals were attributed to the substituent Si atoms. The large difference in the chemical shifts of substituent Si atoms bound to either skeletal Si (5.8 ppm) or Ge (40.8 ppm) atoms is evidently due to the different hybridization degree of these skeletal atoms: sp3-Si vs. sp2-Ge. X-ray crystallography of 2a revealed an isosceles SiGe2 triangle structure, in complete accord with the symmetrical structure of 2a in solution (vide supra). Both skeletal ° Ge@Ge (2.2429(6) A) as well as Si­Ge (2.4168(10) and ° 2.4165(10) A) bond lengths are typical for the heavy cyclopropene systems [1] (Fig. 2). As was expected for digermenes [11], the Ge@Ge bond in 2a is highly trans-bent with the Si4­Ge1­Ge2­Si5 torsional angle of 51.0(2)°. Using dilithiogermane (tBu2MeSi)2GeLi2 [12] instead of 1,1-dilithiosilane (tBu2MeSi)2SiLi2, we synthesized a germanium analogue of 2a, a novel trigermirene derivative tetrakis(di-tert-butylmethylsilyl)-1H-trigermirene (2b) (22%) by the reaction of (tBu2MeSi)2GeLi2 and 1a in toluene (Scheme 3). Quite similar to the case of 1H-siladigermirene 2a, the formation of 2b was accompanied with the production of half an equivalent of digermene (tBu2MeSi)2Ge@Ge(SiMetBu2)2 (3b). Both products were separated employing the same experimental procedure: column chromatography in a glove-box followed by the recrystalli-

zation from pentane to afford dark-red crystals of 2b and deep-blue crystals of the previously unknown digermene 3b [13]. The 1H-trigermirene 2b was completely isostructural to 1H-siladigermirene 2a crystallizing in the same monoclinic P21/c space group with very similar bond distances and bond angles [14]. However, the degree of trans-bending of Ge@Ge double bond in 2b is more pronounced than that in 2a: 60.5(2)° vs. 51.0(2)°. From this structural viewpoint, the comparison of both 2a and 2b with 1H-trisilirene (tBu2MeSi)4Si3 (7a) [2e] and 3H-disilagermirene (tBu2MeSi)4GeSi2 (7b) [3a] (both previously synthesized by us) is particularly instructive, because all these compounds have the same substituents, distinguish-

ing from each other only by the skeletal atoms (Si or Ge, or their combinations) (Fig. 3). Comparing the structures of 2a and 7a (or 2b and 7b), one can easily recognize that the Ge@Ge bond is more trans-bent than the Si@Si bond in both cases: 51.0(2)° vs. 31.9(2)° (or 60.5(2)° vs. 37.0(2)°), which is quite normal because of the well-known tendency for increasing transbending on descending a group 14 [11]. On the other hand, comparing cyclic digermenes 2a and 2b (or cyclic disilenes 7a and 7b), another tendency becomes apparent: the transbending of the same bond Ge@Ge (or Si@Si) is more pronounced when the sp3-skeletal atom is Ge but not Si. This should be ascribed to the immediate influence of the electronegativity difference of Si and Ge atoms (Ge is more electronegative), because the electronegative substituents R increase the pyramidalization degree of doubly-bonded atoms E (E = heavier group 14 element) in compounds of the type R2E = ER2 [11]. Thus, 1H-trigermirene 2b should be recognized as the most highly trans-bent (60.5(2)°) heavy cyclopropene known to date. Apart from their particular structures, both 2a and 2b exhibited an interesting reactivity toward halogenated hydrocarbons, especially CH2Cl2. Thus, both 2a and 2b smoothly reacted with an excess of dry CH2Cl2 to form unexpected products, trans-2,4-dichloro-1,1,2,4-tetrakis(di-tert-butylmethylsilyl)-1,2,4-siladigermetane (5a) and trans-1,3-dichloro-1,2,2,3-tetrakis(di-tert-butylmethylsilyl)1,2,3-trigermetane (5b), respectively, as the result of the ring enlargement reaction (Scheme 4). Both 5a and 5b were isolated in 71% and 69% yield and fully characterized by spectral and crystallographic data. The most diagnostic feature of both 5a and 5b was the markedly low-field signals of the methylene unit of the four-membered ring: 2.79 and 2.98 ppm (1H NMR spectrum), 42.6 and 44.9 ppm (13C NMR spectrum). Such an observation is in evident contrast to other known cyclobutane derivatives featuring the RR 0 Si­CH2­SiRR 0 ­ fragment, which characteristically exhibit the 1H NMR resonances of methylene

protons in the high-field region of 0.18­0.89 ppm [15]. Such a remarkable spectral feature of 5a and 5b might be attributed to the hyperconjugative mixing of r(C­H)­r*(Ge­Cl) orbitals, definitely resulting in the deshielding of both H and C nuclei of the CH2-moiety. The crystal structure analysis of 5a disclosed a folded SiGe2C-four-membered ring (folding angle 33°) with the trans-arrangement of the two Cl atoms bound to the skeletal Ge atoms. The skeletal Si­Ge bonds of 2.475(2) ° and 2.547(3) A significantly exceeded the normal values ° of Si­Ge bond distances (2.384­2.462 A [16]), which was explained by the great steric congestion around the Ge1­ Si2­Ge3 fragment of the cyclic skeleton (Fig. 4). The ° exocyclic Ge­Cl bonds of 2.229(2) and 2.236(2) A are con° siderably longer than the typical values of 2.08­2.15 A [16], a fact that can also be taken as another manifestation of the r(C­H)­r*(Ge­Cl) hyperconjugative interaction. The mechanism for the formation of the four-membered rings 5a and 5b starting from the three-membered

rings 2a and 2b is of particular interest. Although we do not have direct spectroscopic evidence for formation of any detectable intermediates, we can suggest the following reaction scheme. The initial 1,2-addition of CH2Cl2 across the Ge@Ge double bond to form the intermediate cyclopropane derivatives 6a, 6b can be assumed as the reasonable first step of the reaction. The analogous 1,2-addition of the simple chloroalkanes (CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4) to the stable tetrasilyldisilenes [17a] and transient digermenes [17b,c] has been recently reported. The next step of the reaction is assumed to be a formal intramolecular insertion of the CH2-unit into the skeletal Ge­Ge bond accompanied by the migration of Cl atom from C to Ge. One of the evident driving forces for the ring expansion step should be release of the ring strain on going from a three- to a four-membered ring. Indeed, our calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory with the GAUSSIAN 98 program package on the model compounds 5a, 5b (R = SiH3) revealed that the final four-membered rings 5a and 5b are much more stable than the transient three-membered rings 6a and 6b by 41.7 and 41.8 kcal/mol, respectively. We found that the ring expansion reaction with CH2Cl2 is general for all heavy cyclopropenes of the type ðt Bu2 MeSiÞ4 EE02 (E, E 0 = Si, Ge). Thus, 1H-trisilirene 7a and 3H-disilagermirene 7b (previously prepared by us) also smoothly reacted with CH2Cl2 to yield the four-membered ring systems 8a and 8b, totally isostructural to the above described 5a and 5b (Scheme 5). The new compounds 8a and 8b were isolated in a pure form and characterized by NMR spectral and X-ray crystallography data. It should be noted that CH2Cl2 is quite a unique reagent toward 2 and 7 to give the ring enlargement products. Thus, CCl4 reacted with both 2a and 2b to produce the corresponding dichlorocyclopropane derivatives, trans-2, 3-dichloro-1,1,2,3-tetrakis(di-tert-butylmethylsilyl)siladigermirane (9a) and trans-1,2-dichloro-1,2,3,3-tetrakis(ditert-butylmethylsilyl)trigermirane (9b), respectively, instead of the four-membered ring compounds (Scheme 6). That is, carbon tetrachloride in these reactions acts purely as a chlorinating reagent. The striking difference in the reactivity of CH2Cl2 and CCl4 toward the Ge@Ge double bond of 2a and 2b might be caused by the greater steric bulk of the ÆCCl3 radical compared with that of the ÆCH2Cl radical, which precludes

the formation of the CCl3-adduct. The same reaction course was previously observed in the reaction of 1H-trisilirene 7a and 3H-disilagermirene 7b with CCl4, resulting in the quantitative formation of dichloro derivatives analogous to 9a, b [3c]. The reaction of both 2a and 2b with CHCl3 produced complicated reaction mixtures, probably due to the operation of several competing reaction pathways. 3. Experimental 3.1. General procedures All experiments were carried out using high-vacuum line techniques or in an argon atmosphere of MBRAUN MB 150B-G glove box. The solvents were predried over sodium benzophenone ketyl and finally dried and degassed over potassium mirror in vacuum immediately prior to use. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AC-300FT NMR (1H NMR at 300.13 MHz; 13C NMR at 75.47 MHz; 29Si NMR at 59.63 MHz) and Bruker ARX-400FT NMR (1H NMR at 400.23 MHz; 13C NMR at 100.64 MHz; 29Si NMR at 79.52 MHz) spectrometers.
