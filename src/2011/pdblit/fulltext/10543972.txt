The scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) is formed from the cellular isoform (PrPC) by a post-translational process that involves a profound conformational change. Linear epitopes for recombinant antibody Fab fragments (Fabs) on PrPC and on the protease-resistant core of PrPSc, designated PrP 27-30, were identi®ed using ELISA and immunoprecipitation. An epitope region at the C terminus was accessible in both PrPC and PrP 27-30; in contrast, epitopes towards the N-terminal region (residues 90 to 120) were accessible in PrPC but largely cryptic in PrP 27-30. Denaturation of PrP 27-30 exposed the epitopes of the N-terminal domain. We argue from our ®ndings that the major conformational change underlying PrPSc formation occurs within the N-terminal segment of PrP 27-30.

Introduction
Prions cause a group of human and animal neurodegenerative diseases that involve profound modi®cation of the cellular prion protein (PrPC). Spectroscopic measurements demonstrate that the conversion of PrPC into the scrapie isoform (PrPSc) involves a major conformational transition. PrPC has a high a-helical content, some of which is converted into b-sheet when PrPSc is formed (Pan et al., 1993; Pergami et al., 1996; Safar et al., 1993). The protease-resistant core of PrPSc, denoted PrP 27-30, also has a high b-sheet content (Caughey et al.,

Structural studies of the PrP isoforms expressed in mammalian cells and of PrPSc have proved dif®cult because the level of PrPC expression is low and PrPSc forms insoluble amorphous aggregates upon puri®cation (McKinley et al., 1991; Scott et al., 1988). Large synthetic PrP peptides and Escherichia coli-derived PrP as well as molecular modeling have provided some information that may prove applicable to the structure of PrPC (James et al., 1997; Mehlhorn et al., 1996; Riek et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1995). The data reported here provide the ®rst glimpse of the localized conformational changes that PrPC undergoes as it is converted into PrPSc. One approach to probing conformational rearrangements in prion proteins is to raise antibodies to diverse epitopes of PrPC and PrPSc. There is, however, a lack of any detectable immune response, either humoral or cellular, to infectious

scrapie particles (Chandler, 1959; Clarke & Haig, 1966; Tsukamoto et al., 1985). Polyclonal anti-PrP antibodies have been raised in rabbits following immunization with large amounts of Syrian hamster (SHa) PrP 27-30 (Bendheim et al., 1984; Bode et al., 1985). Similarly, anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have been produced in mice, but only to three non-murine epitopes, suggesting that tolerance to mouse (Mo) PrPC prevented generation of mAbs to the Mo PrP sequence (Barry & Prusiner, 1986; Kascsak et al., 1987; Rogers et al., 1991) . We have circumvented many of these problems by immunizing PrP-de®cient (Prnp0/0) mice (Prusiner et al., 1993) and rescuing antibodies via phage display libraries. In our initial studies, Prnp0/0 mice were immunized with puri®ed Mo prion rods (Prusiner et al., 1993); from these mice, a panel of monoclonal Fab fragments was obtained corresponding to ®ve major speci®cities (Williamson et al., 1996). All of the antibodies recognized PrPSc denatured with 3 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GdnSCN) both in vitro and in situ, as well as recombinant PrP spanning residues 90 to 231, produced in E. coli (Mehlhorn et al., 1996). All but one of the antibodies also bound to PrPC on the cell surface as determined by ¯ow cytometry. Disappointingly, however, PrP 27-30 was not detected by any of these antibodies prior to treatment with GdnSCN. An explanation for this ®nding may lie in the physicochemical properties and antigenicity of PrP 2730 in prion rods. During puri®cation of PrPSc, brain homogenate was subjected to digestion with proteinase K and extraction with 0.5% Sarkosyl. Puri®ed PrP 27-30 polymerizes into rod-like structures of 100 to 200 nm in length that are composed of as many as 1000 PrP 27-30 molecules (McKinley et al., 1991; Prusiner et al., 1983). This aggregation may reduce effective epitope concentrations, thereby hindering ef®cient immunization and selection of speci®c antibody phage. We have previously shown that epitope concentration is a critical factor in effective selection from antibody phage display libraries (Parren et al., 1996). In the study reported here, we have attempted to overcome the possible problem of cryptic epitopes in PrP 27-30 within prion rods by immunizing mice with a dispersed form of PrP 27-30 (Gabizon et al., 1987) and rescuing the corresponding recombinant antibodies. The dispersed form of PrP 27-30 is prepared by sonication, solubilization in detergent, and incorporation into liposomes (Gabizon et al., 1987). The procedure does not result in any loss of scrapie infectivity. Prnp0/0 mice immunized with dispersed PrP 27-30 were used to generate a new panel of recombinant antibodies, some of which react with nondenatured PrP 27-30. A comparison of the reactivity of antibodies with PrPC with that with nondenatured PrP 27-30 reveals that conformational differences between the two molecules lie within the N-terminal region corresponding to residues 90 to 120.

Results
Isolation of recombinant Fabs against PrP isoforms Prnp0/0 mice were immunized with SHaPrP 2730 solubilized into liposomes (Gabizon et al., 1987). To increase diversity of the antibody response, the mice were immunized for ``short'' (immunization and boost) and ``long'' (immunization and two boosts) periods of time. In contrast to immunization with SHa- or MoPrP 27-30 in rods (Williamson et al., 1996), which produced a predominantly IgG1/IgG2b response, immunization with SHaPrP 27-30 in liposomes resulted in a response including all four IgG subclasses with particularly high serum titers in the IgG1 and IgG2b subclasses (>105 compared to 4 Â 104 for IgG2a and 104 for IgG3). Eight Fab phage display libraries were constructed: IgG1k, IgG2ak, IgG2bk, and IgG3k from RNA extracted from the short and long-term immunized mice. In each case, RNA prepared from the spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes was pooled. All of the libraries contained more than 1 Â 107 members. To perform antigen-based selection from the libraries, it was necessary to present dispersed SHaPrP 27-30 in a form that would allow separation of free and antigen-bound phage. Accordingly, SHaPrP 27-30 polymerized into amyloid rods was dispersed into liposomes. Subsequently, the solubilized SHaPrP 27-30 was biotinylated and captured on streptavidin-coated microtiter plates. As we were aiming to isolate antibodies to PrPSc, we studied the effect of biotinylation upon prion infectivity (Table 1). Although SHaPrP 27-30 was biotinylated with high ratios of biotin to PrP, none of the biotinylated PrP showed reduction in prion infectivity. The solubilized PrP 27-30 showed an increase in speci®c infectivity relative to SHaPrP 27-30 assembled into rods as previously found (Gabizon et al., 1987). After panning the IgG1k and IgG2bk libraries against liposome-dispersed, captured SHaPrP 27-30, bacterial supernatants from 50 of 80 clones reacted with the selecting antigen in ELISA. Upon DNA sequencing of the heavychain variable domain, 8 of 19 clones were identi®ed as distinct. Supernatants from all of these clones also reacted strongly with recombinant SHaPrP(90-231), designated rPrP (Mehlhorn et al., 1996), as described below. Subsequently, all eight libraries were panned against this antigen to yield an additional 14 distinct clones. Seven Fab clones were chosen for detailed investigation. Fab reactivity against rPrP and PrPC We characterized the exposure of the epitopes de®ned by the recombinant antibodies in various forms of PrP to explore the differences in conformation between PrPC and PrPSc.

had described Fabs that recognize denatured SHaPrP 27-30 and native PrPC, but not nondenatured PrP 27-30 (Williamson et al., 1996). We now report on the ability of new recombinant Fabs to detect non-denatured PrP 27-30 by ELISA and by immunoprecipitation assays. Except for D13 and D4, the Fabs reacted equally well with rPrP in ELISA, whether or not the antigen was treated with GdnSCN (Figure 1(a)). All of the recombinant Fabs, together with the hybridoma-derived 13A5 and 3F4 mAbs (Barry & Prusiner, 1986; Kascsak et al., 1987), also reacted strongly with PrP 27-30 rods that had been coated onto ELISA wells and then exposed to 3 M GdnSCN (Figure 1(b)). We determined whether each of the antibodies was able to immunoprecipitate PrPC from transfected CHO cells expressing SHaPrPC. Figure 2 illustrates that all of the antibodies reacted with PrPC in this assay. The slightly weaker bands precipitated by R72 and 13A5 may re¯ect the lower af®nity of these antibodies for PrP. The foregoing experiments indicate that nine antibodies speci®c for ®ve distinct PrP epitope regions all recognize rPrP in a PrPC-like conformation, GdnSCN-treated PrP 27-30, and PrPC expressed in transfected CHO cells. Moreover, in an earlier report we described ®ve additional recombinant Fabs that recognize both denatured PrP 27-30 and rPrP, and MoPrPC (Williamson et al., 1996). When taken together these data support the argument that following exposure to denaturant, the conformation of PrP 27-30 is disturbed and upon removal of the denaturant, the protein adopts a PrPC-like conformation. Cryptic and exposed epitopes on PrP 27-30 We compared the immunoreactivity of recombinant Fabs with native and GdnSCN-treated PrP 27-30 by ELISA (Figure 3). Although our data suggest that GdnSCN-treated PrP 27-30 refolds to a PrPC-like molecule, we refer to this GdnSCNtreated protein as denatured for convenience and clarity. To expose hidden epitopes, PrP 27-30 rods were dispersed into liposomes, biotinylated, and captured onto the surface of streptavidin-coated ELISA wells. Three Fabs designated R10, D13, and D4 bound weakly to native PrP 27-30 but reacted strongly with denatured PrP 27-30. In contrast, the

three Fabs designated R1, R2, and D2 bound almost as well to native PrP 27-30 as to denatured PrP 27-30. The Fab designated R72 gave a pattern of immunoreactivity that was intermediate between the two groups of Fabs described above. The R10, D13, and D4 Fabs showed a pattern of immunoreactivity with native and denatured PrP 27-30 similar to that found for the 3F4 Fab, which binds to PrP residues 109 to 112 (Rogers et al., 1991). The R72 Fab demonstrated a pattern of immunoreactivity with native and denatured PrP 27-30 similar to that found for the 13A5 Fab, which binds to PrP residues 138 to 141 (Rogers et al., 1991). To extend the results of our ELISA studies, we examined two Fabs with respect to immunoprecipitation of PrP 27-30 incorporated into liposomes. Previously, no PrP-speci®c antibodies, either those derived from hybridoma fusions or those from phage libraries, were able to immunoprecipitate PrP 27-30, unless it was ®rst treated with GdnSCN (Borchelt et al., 1992; Taraboulos et al., 1990, 1992). In striking contrast to those earlier studies, 50 ng of the R2 Fab ef®ciently precipitated native PrP 27-30 (Figure 4). As in the earlier studies noted above, neither the D4 nor the 3F4 Fab was able to immunoprecipitate PrP 27-30. Even 500 ng of the D4 or 3F4 Fab was insuf®cient to immunoprecipitate native PrP 27-30 dispersed into liposomes as measured by Western blotting. Identification of epitopes On the basis of our results with ELISA and immunoprecipitation studies of SHaPrP 27-30 (Figures 3 and 4), the Fab fragments can be divided into three subgroups. To identify the epitopes of SHaPrP with which the seven Fabs react, we puri®ed the Fabs by af®nity chromatography and probed their epitopes by measuring immunoreactivity against a series of synthetic PrP peptides. Twenty-seven peptides of 15 residues in length and overlapping by ®ve residues at the N terminus were synthesized, coated onto ELISA plates, and screened for reactivity with each of the Fabs. Data from these studies identi®ed three distinct and apparently linear epitope regions (Figure 5). The three Fabs, R10, D4, and D13, reacted with peptides corresponding to residues 95 to 104, designated epitope region I; Fab R72 reacted with

an N-terminal conformational transition features in the formation of PrPSc.

Discussion
Our results with PrP-speci®c Fabs provide a structural map of the conformational transition that features in the formation of PrPSc. These ®ndings, in concert with information from other recent studies, demonstrate that the N-terminal region of PrP 27-30 from residue 90 to 120 is critical for PrPSc formation (Muramoto et al., 1996). Deletion of any portion of this region prevents the acquisition of protease resistance, a property that is often but not always characteristic of PrPSc. Synthetic peptides corresponding to this region of PrP exhibit considerable conformational ¯exibility consistent with the a-helix to b-sheet transition (Zhang et al., 1995) that PrPC undergoes when it is transformed into PrPSc. The conformational plasticity of this region is further emphasized by the recent ®ndings that two distinct prion strains exhibit different sites of proteolytic cleavage within this region (Bessen & Marsh, 1994; Telling et al., 1996). These ®ndings are in accord with molecular modeling studies that predicted that the N-terminal region of PrP 27-30 was likely to be the site where a-helical structures were transformed into b-sheets as PrPSc was formed (Huang et al., 1994, 1996). While no NMR or X-ray structures of full-length PrPC are available, structures of rPrP, which corresponds to the

tivity with respect to native and denatured PrP 2730 similar to that of the hybridoma-derived IgG 3F4, which binds to SHaPrP residues 109 to 112. The R72 Fab binding to epitope region II showed a pattern of immunoreactivity similar to the hybridoma-derived 13A5 mAb which binds to SHaPrP residues 138 to 141. The excellent correlation between the epitopes of the Fabs and the previously known epitopes of the hybridoma-derived IgG 3F4 and 13A5 mAbs (Rogers et al., 1991) with respect to immunoreactivity with native and denatured PrP 27-30 supports our conclusion that

619 infectious fragment of the scrapie isoform synthesized in E. coli, con®rm the conformational heterogeneity in the region from residue 90 to 112 (James et al., 1997). The studied C terminus epitope region (225 to 231) is adjacent to SHa residues 215 and 219, which are at the binding site of a presumed protein, designated protein X, that mediates PrPSc formation (Kaneko et al., 1997). Our ®nding that the C termini of PrPC and PrPSc are conformationally similar as judged by immunoreactivity with Fabs is of particular interest with respect to protein X, since this protein seems to bind PrPC but not PrPSc (Telling et al., 1995). In summary, we report for the ®rst time an epitope region at the C terminus that is exposed in both PrPC and PrPSc. In contrast, epitopes towards the N terminus of the protein that are largely cryptic in PrPSc are exposed in PrPC. The observations suggest that the major conformational changes required for the acquisition of prion infectivity occur in the N-terminal portion of the protein. This conclusion is of considerable interest given modeling studies that emphasize the likelihood of conformational lability of this region as noted above (Huang et al., 1994, 1996), invariant sequence found in this region across all species È examined (Bamborough et al., 1996; Schatzl et al., 1995), and recent NMR data suggesting that the C terminus of PrP contains two helices in a tightly packed conformation with considerable disorder towards the N terminus (James et al., 1997; Riek et al., 1996).

R10, D13, and D4 Fabs are directed to epitope region I, corresponding to SHaPrP residues 95 to 104 (red); R72 to epitope II, corresponding to residues 152 to 164 and encompassing the S1 b-sheet composed of residues 161 to 163 (cyan); R1, R2, and D2 to epitope region III, corresponding to residues 225 to 231 (gold). Fabs 3F4 and 13A5, derived from hybridoma antibodies, are directed to residues 109 to 112 (pink) or residues 138 to 141 (magenta), respectively. The a-helices are labeled A, B, and C (gray) and the S2 b-sheet corresponds to residues 129 to 131 (green). The N-terminal region from residues 90 to 112 represents only one of several structures due to conformational heterogeneity of the rPrP protein (adapted from James et al. (1997)). The illustration was generated with the program UCSF Midasplus.

Formation of the Scrapie PrP Isoform ELISA Fab reactivities against rPrP (200 ng/well in 0.1 M bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.6) were assayed as described (Burton et al., 1991). For SHaPrP 27-30 detection, streptavidin-coated ELISA wells were coated with 50 ml of biotinylated SHaPrP 27-30 liposomes (4 mg/ml) in the presence of 0.3 % Zwittergent 3-12. To denature the antigens in situ, 50 ml of 6 M GdnSCN was added to the precoated well to a ®nal concentration of 3 M GdnSCN. Alternatively, the supernatants were aspirated after overnight coating with the antigen and the wells were treated with 3 M GdnSCN solution. After ten minutes at room temperature the plates were washed six times and blocked as described (Burton et al., 1991). Figure 6 demonstrates that treatment of the ELISA microtiter well with GdnSCN as high as 6 M did not release rPrP or biotinylated SHaPrP 27-30 from the plate. Immunoprecipitation of PrPC and SHaPrP 27-30 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing recombinant SHaPrPC were metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine as described (Kaneko et al., 1995). A 100 ml volume of protein extracts was mixed with 0.5 mg of puri®ed antibody Fab in 0.5 ml of cell-lysis buffer and incubated overnight at 4 C. Fab± PrP complexes were immunoprecipitated with goat antimouse IgG Fab and Protein G/agarose, then separated on SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were detected by ¯uorography as described (Kaneko et al., 1995). For immunoprecipitation of SHaPrP 27-30, a 10 ml volume of liposomes containing SHaPrP 27-30 was mixed with different amounts of puri®ed recombinant Fab and incubated overnight at 4 C in the presence of 1.6% sodium cholate. Goat anti-mouse IgG Fab (2 mg) was then added and the mixture incubated at room temperature for two hours. The Fab± PrP complexes were then precipitated with 15 ml of Protein G/agarose for one hour at 4 C and

Materials and Methods
Preparation of biotinylated PrP 27-30 liposomes Puri®ed SHaprion rods were prepared from the brains of Syrian hamsters showing signs of CNS dysfunction following inoculation with Sc237 prions as described (Prusiner et al., 1983). Sucrose fractions containing SHaPrP 27-30 were diluted 2 : 1 in distilled water and centrifuged at 100,000 g for six hours at 4 C. The pellet was resuspended in water, centrifuged again, and resuspended at 50 mg/ml in a Hepes/NaCl buffer (10 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl) containing 2% sodium cholate. The mixture was then added to dried synthetic phosphatidylcholine lipids, achieving a concentration of hydrated lipid of 5 mg/ml (Gabizon et al., 1987), before sonication for 30 minutes at 4 C. This sonicated mixture was then centrifuged at 30,000 g for 25 minutes at 4 C and the supernatant was dialyzed against Hepes/NaCl buffer for 18 hours at 4 C to yield liposomes. The amount of SHaPrP 27-30 taken up into the liposome preparations was determined by a dot blot assay in which liposomes were mixed with an equal amount of 2Â SDS sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 M dithiothreitol), boiled for four minutes, and blotted under vacuum. SHaPrP 27-30 was probed with antibody 3F4 and a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and then detected using the ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham). Known amounts of rPrP and PrP 27-30 were employed as standards in this assay. To biotinylate liposome-associated PrP 27-30, NHS-LC-biotin was added in the molar ratio of 10 : 1 (biotin : PrP 27-30) and the mixture was incubated on ice for two hours before dialysis against a Hepes/NaCl buffer for greater than 18 hours at 4 C.

Immunization of Prnp0/0 mice and library construction Six-week-old Prnpo/o mice were immunized by intraperitoneal injection of liposomes containing 25 mg dispersed SHaPrP 27-30 fully emulsi®ed in complete Freund's adjuvant. Fourteen days after the initial immunization, the mice received a single boost of liposomes containing 25 mg of SHaPrP 27-30 emulsi®ed in RIBI's adjuvant. Six days after the boost, half the mice were sacri®ced for library construction. The remaining mice received a second boost of liposomes containing 25 mg of SHaPrP 27-30 and were killed six days later. Mouse serum collected at the time of killing was examined for PrP reactivity in ELISA and Western blot assays. RNA was prepared from bone marrow, spleen, and lymph node tissues of the mice as described (Huse et al., 1989; Williamson et al., 1996). The preparation of antibody libraries on the surface of ®lamentous phage has been described (Barbas et al., 1991; Burton & Barbas, 1994; Williamson et al., 1993). The oligonucleotide primer MIgG2a (5H -GAG AGA GGG GTT CTG ACT AGT GGG CAC TCT GGG CTC -3H ) was employed for PCR ampli®cation of heavy chains of the IgG2a subclass. Phage recovered from the fourth or ®fth round of panning were modi®ed for soluble Fab expression and then selected for PrP reactivity in ELISA. Antibody clones chosen for further analysis were grown in quantity and af®nity puri®ed as described (Burton et al., 1991).

The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with 3F4 mAb. To immunoprecipitate-denatured SHaPrP 27-30, a 10 ml volume of liposomes containing SHaPrP 27-30 was boiled for ten minutes in the presence of 1 M GdnSCN. The liposomes were diluted to 0.02 M GdnSCN and the denatured PrP was immunoprecipitated and detected as described previously for SHaPrP 27-30 liposomes.
