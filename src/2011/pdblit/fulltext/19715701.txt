FF domains are small protein­protein interaction modules that have two flanking conserved phenylalanine residues. They are present in proteins involved in transcription, RNA splicing, and signal transduction, and often exist in tandem arrays. Although several individual FF domain structures have been determined by NMR, the tandem nature of most FF domains has not been revealed. Here we report the 2.7-Å-resolution crystal structure of the first three FF domains of the human transcription elongation factor CA150. Each FF domain is composed of three -helices and a 310 helix between -helix 2 and -helix 3. The most striking feature of the structure is that an FF domain is connected to the next by an -helix that continues from helix 3 to helix 1 of the next. The consequent elongated arrangement allows exposure of many charged residues within the region that can be engaged in interaction with other molecules. Binding studies using a peptide ligand suggest that a specific conformation of the FF domains might be required to achieve higher-affinity binding. Additionally, we explore potential DNA binding of the FF construct used in this study. Overall, we provide the first crystal structure of an FF domain and insights into the tandem nature of the FF domains and suggest that, in addition to protein binding, FF domains might be involved in DNA binding. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Crystal Structure of Three Tandem FF Domains

Introduction
Since the discovery of the Src homology 2 domain in the late 1980s,1,2 many protein­protein interaction modules have been shown to play important roles in

numerous cellular processes. Compared to bettercharacterized domains such as Src homology 2, Src homology 3, PDZ, and WW, structure­function relationships of the recently discovered FF domain are still not very clear. These domains derive their

Fig. 1. Structures of human FF-domain-containing proteins. (a) Domain structure of CA150. The N-terminal half of the molecule is strongly compositionally biased with two proline-rich regions, one alanine/glutamine-rich region, one threonine-rich region, and one glutamate-rich region (all in gray). There are also three scattered WW domains (red) in the N-terminal region. The C-terminal half is mostly occupied by six FF domains (green). Three potential coiled-coil regions (blue) and one nuclear localization signal (magenta) have also been predicted within the molecule. (b) Sequence alignment of the FF domains in human proteins: CA150 (SWISS-Prot ID O14776), PRPF40A (SWISS-Prot ID O75400), PRPF40B (SWISS-Prot ID Q6NWY9), P190A (SWISS-Prot ID Q9NRY4), and P190B (SWISS-Prot ID Q13017). The FF domain sequences were aligned using Clustal X (version 2.0.10),46 with manual adjustments, and alignment outcome was rendered using Web-based ESPript.47 (c) Superimposition of individual NMR structures of the FF domains currently in the PDB. This diagram and all of the structure diagrams throughout the article were prepared using PyMOL. The structural models used are chain A of each of the following NMR structures: human FBP11/FNBP3 FF1 (PDB ID 1UZC) and FF5 (PDB ID 2CQN); yeast Prp40 FF1 (PDB ID 2B7E); human CA150 FF1, FF2, FF3, and FF4 (PDB IDs 2DOD, 2E71, 2DOE, and 2DOF, respectively); and yeast URN1 FF domain (PDB ID 2JUC).

399 of 1098 residues.6 Its N-terminal half is highly compositionally biased along with three WW domains, whereas most of the C-terminal half is occupied by six FF domains. The interaction regions between CA150 and RNAP II have been mapped to the FF domains of CA150 and the phosphorylated C-terminal domain (pCTD) of the polymerase.11 The N-terminal PGM motif of CA150 is arginine methylated by the transcriptional coactivator CARM1, and this methylation event generates a docking site for the tudor domain of the splicing factor SMN.12 Consistent with its role in coupling transcription and mRNA processing, CA150 has a potential nuclear localization signal upstream of the first FF domain6 and is localized in nuclear speckles that are rich in mRNA processing factors.13 Dysregulation of CA150 expression has been implicated in the onset of Huntington's disease.14 Like CA150, FF-containing splicing factors PRPF40A and PRPF40B are also involved in mRNA processing15 and bind to the pCTD of RNAP II.16 They both have two WW domains and four and two FF domains, respectively. In contrast, each of the FF-containing RhoGAP proteins P190A and P190B has four FF domains but no WW domain. Instead, they have an N-terminal GTPase region and a C-terminal RhoGAP domain. Recently, P190 FF domains have been shown to mediate a growthfactor-stimulated phosphorylation-dependent

name from the two conserved phenylalanine residues near the N- and C-termini (we shall refer to them as FN and FC, respectively) (Fig. 1). FF domains are typically composed of 60 residues and are found in a limited set of eukaryotic proteins, including transcription elongation factor CA150 (also known as TCERG1), pre-mRNA splicing factors PRPF40A (Prp40, FBP11, FNBP3, and HYPA) and PRPF40B (HYPC), and RhoGAP proteins P190A (GRLF1) and P190B (RHG05).3 One of the intriguing features of the FF domains is that they often occur as multiple copies in tandem. As noted by Ester and Uetz,4 all of the metazoan FF-domaincontaining proteins in the SMART database5 have two or more FF domains, whereas more than 83% of them have four to six FF domains. In addition, FFcontaining proteins often have WW domains (Fig. 1). Another noteworthy feature is the presence of an FXXLL motif in the FF domain. Figure 1b shows the sequence alignment of the human FF-containing proteins. The pairwise sequence homology is in the range of 15­30%, with most of the conserved residues in the hydrophobic core. CA150 (co-activator of 150 kDa), thus far the beststudied FF-domain-containing protein, is a regulator of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription elongation6,7 and mRNA processing8 and serves as a link between the two processes.9,10 As shown in Fig. 1a, human CA150 is a large molecule composed

400 signaling pathway, leading to transcriptional activation of some serum-inducible genes.17 To date, the structures of several single FF domains from various proteins have been determined by NMR spectroscopy. These include human Prp40 FF domain 1 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1UZC]18 and human Prp40 FF domain 5 (PDB ID 2CQN; Riken Structural Genomics/Proteomics Initiative), yeast Prp40 FF domain 1 (PDB ID 2B7E),19 the (only) FF domain of yeast pre-mRNA splicing factor URN1 (PDB ID 2JUC),20 and the first four individual FF domains of CA150 (PDB IDs 2DOD, 2E71, 2DOE, and 2DOF, respectively; all from Riken Structural Genomics/Proteomics Initiative). As shown in Fig. 1c, the overall architecture of these FF domains is very similar: three -helices forming a bundle with a 310 helix () in the linker loop connecting the second and third helices. One variation to this so-called "FF fold" is observed in the first FF domain of P190A.21 This recent NMR structure revealed that the 310 helix is replaced by an -helix that is a full turn longer. Nevertheless, none of these structures is able to shed light on the tandem nature of the FF domains; thus, there is no structural information on their orientation with respect to each other. We sought to study this using X-ray crystallography, starting with crystallization of several tandem FF constructs, and crystallized a construct of the first three FF domains of human CA150. Here we present this first crystal structure of an FF domain laying bare the spatial arrangement of these domains. FF domains from different proteins exhibit a variety of ligand preferences.4 Through our binding studies, we suggest that a favorable conformation may be necessary in order to achieve a higher binding affinity for its protein partner. Moreover, we provide biochemical evidence to propose that CA150 FF2, resembling a homeodomain, may be involved in binding to DNA.

Results and Discussion
Protein modification and structure determination The crystal structure reported here is that of human CA150 FF1­3 (amino acid residues 661­ 845). During the early stage of this study, we were able to crystallize the native protein under various conditions. However, none of the crystal forms gave rise to sufficient diffraction quality for us to solve the structure. Inspired by a report by Walter et al., we carried out reductive lysine methylation of the protein.22 The modification procedure is relatively simple and has been used as a routine rescue strategy in protein crystallization.22 CA150 FF1­3 was modified essentially according to published protocol and further purified by gel filtration. The completion of the reaction was confirmed by mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 2, all 30 lysine side chains, as well as the N-terminal NH2 group of the protein, were

quantitatively dimethylated after the treatment, leading to an 867.8-Da increase in molecular mass, almost identical with the calculated molecular mass increase of 868.0 Da (31 × 28.0 Da). Therefore, we used dimethylated lysine residues exclusively in model building. Purified methylated FF1­3 protein was crystallized at 4 °C under several conditions, most of which overlapped with those used for native protein crystallization. One novel condition that gave rise to a new morphology (hexagonal rods) of the crystals was discovered. Preliminary diffraction analysis showed a significantly improved quality of these crystals: the best crystals of FF1­3 without lysine methylation X-ray diffracted to an  4-Å Bragg spacing at a synchrotron source, in spite of their much bigger size (typically 500 m × 500 m × 500 m), whereas those with methylation diffracted to beyond 2.4 Å. Structure determination was carried out by singlewavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) on a selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted crystal. The structure was refined to 2.70 Å resolution, with data collection and refinement statistics as reported in Table 1. There are two molecules (A and B) in each asymmetric unit, with molecule B being more ordered than molecule A. The final model has all of the residues for two molecules, except residues 737­757 in molecule A. In addition, five extra Nterminal residues (GPLGS) introduced from the cloning vector are also modeled in each molecule.

401 second one is rather straight. The two connector helices have a cross angle of  110° (Fig. 3b). Overall, the molecule has a wide open V-shape and is very elongated, with dimensions of 100 Å×45 Å×25 Å (Fig. 3). The structure has a very large and extensive exposed surface area for interacting with other proteins. There are 25 residues between the FC residue of FF1 and the FN residue of FF2, and between the FC residue of FF2 and the FN residue of FF3. Consequently, the two arms of the V-shape are of the same length. However, the connecting regions between FF3 and FF4, between FF4 and FF5, and between FF5 and FF6 have 62, 14, and 14 residues, respectively. The variation in the connector length is common among the FF domains in different proteins. Out of the 185 CA150 residues in this construct, there are 15 arginines, 30 lysines, 13 aspartates, and 22 glutamates. In other words, more than 43% of the side chains are either positively or negatively charged, creating a molecular surface that can be engaged in binding to other molecules through interdigitation of complementary charges. Figure 4a highlights the locations of these charged residues (in blue and red), and Fig. 4b shows the electrostatic potential as calculated by APBS.23 Overall, this region is rich in basic residues, with a calculated isoelectric point of 10. Comparison of the CA150 NMR and crystal structures Figure 3d shows the superimpositions of the individual CA150 FF domain NMR structures (PDB IDs 2DOD, 2E71, and 2DOE) onto this crystal structure. Overall, they all can be superimposed very well, with RMSD values of 0.77, 1.74, and 1.25 Å (values from PyMOL), respectively. Indeed, these NMR structures provided casual guidance during our model building of the crystal structure. They have a three-residue overlap between each adjacent pair. However, it was not clear how an FF domain would connect to the next because the very N- and C-termini in each individual structure are very flexible and have lost their helical conformation. Moreover, it is interesting to see that in the NMR structures of FF1 and FF3, residues 659­660 and 846­848 (not included in our construct) are helical, suggesting that the helices may extend beyond the construct in this study. It is tempting to propose that this FF-containing region of the protein forms a big open structure, assuming that all of the connecting regions are also -helical. Based upon secondary structure prediction, this assumption is likely to be true. In a more recent NMR structure reported in an accompanying article, Murphy et al. used a CA150 construct containing the CA150 FF1 and some extra residues at the C-terminus and showed that the extension is -helical in solution, suggesting that the

The conventional and free R-factors of the final model are 23.0% and 28.3%, respectively. Of note, we were unable to solve the structure by molecular replacement using the available NMR structures as search models. Overall architecture As shown in Fig. 3, the three FF domains of CA150 (in red; boundaries as defined in Fig. 1b) are well separated in space, and each one is connected to the next by a long helix (4.5 turns) (in green) that extends contiguously from the last helix (3) of an FF domain to the first helix (1) of the next. Given this architecture, the orientation of the first FF domain dictates that of the second, and so on. The first connector helix (between FF1 and FF2) has a slight curvature along the axis of the helix, while the

helical nature of the connectors in our structure was not caused by crystallographic artifacts.24 Peptide binding studies The FF domain was originally suggested to be a protein­protein interaction module,3 and this concept received further experimental support from different groups. Common to this theme is that FF domains from CA150 and Prp40 are clearly shown to bind to RNAP II via the enzyme's phosphorylated heptad repeats YpSPTpSPS (pS is phosphoserine) in the Cterminal domain.9,11,16 On the other hand, FF domains

are also known to bind to other sequences. For example, FF1 of yeast Prp40 can bind to the crnTRP1 repeat with a sequence of GAMGSTNIDILDLEELREYORRKRTEYEGYLKRNRLD.19 Nevertheless, there is no detailed structural information available on any FF domain­ligand interaction. More directly relevant to our study is the report by Smith et al., in which a spot peptide array scanning a CA150-binding protein, HIV Tat-specific factor 1, was screened against CA150 FF1­3 as a C-terminal fusion to glutathione S-transferase (GST).25 The authors identified a consensus sequence of (D/E)2-5-F/W/Y(D/E)2-5 as an FF ligand.25 Using fluorescence

Fig. 6. MALS characterization of FF1­3 and GST-FF1-3. Purified FF1­3 sample was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column [20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5) and 250 mM NaCl] with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/ min. The filtrate was analyzed online by a MALS device (Wyatt). The light-scattering signal at 90o (left axis; linear scale) and the measured molecular mass in daltons (right axis; log scale) were plotted against the elution volume in milliliters. FF1­3 (red curve) appeared monodisperse with an apparent molecular mass of 23.2 kDa (green curve), very close to the calculated molecular mass of 22.6 kDa. The majority of GST­ FF1­3 (blue curve) also appeared to be monodisperse and dimeric (purple curve), whereas a small portion of the fusion protein appeared heterogeneous, forming tetramer and/or higher molecular mass aggregates (brown curve).

polarization (FP), they demonstrated that the peptide with the highest binding affinity (dissociation constant Kd = 48 M) for GST­FF1­3 has the sequence WFHVEED. To gain structural insights into an FF binding to its ligand, we synthesized the same peptide and used it either as a premixture with the protein in crystallization trials or to soak the peptide into preformed crystals, with a peptide/ protein molar ratio ranging from 3:1 to 10:1. However, in electron density maps generated from crystals grown in the presence of, or soaked with, the peptide, we could not obtain any evidence of the peptide's existence. To further examine the peptide binding properties of the FF domains, we synthesized the fluorescentlabeled peptide 5-carboxyfluorescein-AWFHVEED and used it in FP binding studies. The three protein constructs used were GST­FF1­3, FF1­3 alone, and GST alone, with the latter two generated by a single PreScission protease cleavage between GST and FF1­3. As shown in Fig. 5 (top curve), binding between the labeled peptide and GST­FF1­3 reached saturation at a protein concentration of 1 mM. Data analysis using "one-site specific binding" mode yielded a Kd of  32 M, similar to a Kd of 48 M reported by Smith et al.25 However, a significantly weaker binding (Kd N 400 M) was detected for FF1­3 alone (middle curve). Even at a protein concentration of 1 mM, binding still did not reach saturation. When GST alone was used (bottom curve), even weaker binding was observed (Kd N 740 M), suggesting that the observed binding between GST and FF1­3 was unlikely to be caused by the presence of GST. Since GST is well known to dimerize,26 perhaps the FF domains in the fusion context adopt a more favorable conformation for peptide binding in the context of a GST-mediated dimer. The exact cause of this apparent increased binding of GST­FF1­3 remains to be elucidated. Alternatively, the linker between GST and FF1­3 in the fusion context was

somehow involved in binding when it was not cleaved. Nonetheless, the apparently weak binding between FF1­3 and the potential ligand could perhaps also explain the failure to observe the peptide in electron density maps. Further investigations are necessary to determine the nature of an FF ligand and its association with an FF domain. Of note, we have not been able to crystallize the GST­ FF1­3 fusion protein. One possible explanation for the increased binding affinity of GST­FF1­3 could be that FF1­3 could dimerize, either in isolation or in the context of the full-length CA150 protein. We used multiangle light scattering (MALS) to characterize the oligomerization states of purified FF1­3 and GST­FF1­3 in solution. As shown in Fig. 6, the measured molecular mass of FF1­3 was 23.2 kDa (red curve for LS signal and green for molecular mass), compared to the calculated molecular mass of 22.6 kDa. This clearly showed that FF1­3 was monomeric in solution. In comparison, the majority of GST­FF1­3 fusion protein had a measured molecular mass of 102.4 kDa (second peak in the blue curve), suggesting a dimer of GST­FF1­3 (calculated molecular mass, 49.7 kDa). There were also some heterogeneous and higher-molecular-mass aggregates of more than 230 kDa (first peak in the blue curve). Although the reason for the formation of these aggregates is not clear, our data suggest that it is unlikely to be caused by the presence of FF1­3 in the fusion. Furthermore, the hydrodynamic radii (Rhyd) of FF1­3 and GST­FF1­3 are 29 and 56 Å, respectively, as measured by dynamic light scattering. Using the monomeric structure of FF1­3, we calculated Rhyd and the radius of gyration Rg. The Rhyd obtained from HYDROPRO27 was 30.4 Å, in good agreement with 29 Å measured by dynamic light scattering. This supports the monomeric state of FF1­3 in solution. The Rg values obtained from MOLEMAN228 and HYDROPRO were 33.0 and

32.8 Å, respectively. These values are greater than the Rhyd for FF1­3, consistent with the nonglobular shape of the FF1­3 molecule. In summary, we ruled out the possibility of FF1­3 forming a dimer in solution. Whether the full-length CA150 could form a dimer/oligomer remains to be defined. FF domains from different proteins, albeit with the same fold, are quite divergent in sequence (Fig. 1b). Consequently, they most likely have different molecular surface properties. As summarized in Table 1 of Ester and Uetz, FF domains can bind to a variety of protein motifs.4 Thus, it is clear that not all FF domains are created equal. For example, CA150 FF domains 1, 3, and 4 do not bind to the pCTD (as judged by Far Western blot analysis), whereas FF5 binds strongly and FF2 binds weakly.11 Not surprisingly, the binding surface on Prp40 for the Clf1 TPR1 motif19 is not the same as that on Prp40 for the RNAP II C-terminal domain phosphopeptide.18 This can probably be rationalized, in part, by the different pKa values of the different FF domains. In the case of CA150, FF1 and FF2 have similar basic pKa values (9.2 and 9.1, respectively), and FF3 and FF4 have similar neutral values (6.9 and 6.1, respectively).20 Considering all these, it seems more plausible that the tandem yet versatile FF domains act as a scaffold to bind to a diverse repertoire of molecules, allowing subsequent functional events to occur in close proximity in a concerted manner.

Potential DNA binding of CA150 FF1­3 Structural analysis using the ProFunc server29,30 suggested that the CA150 FF2 domain could bind to DNA: this domain is structurally similar to the yeast DNA-binding homeodomain protein MAT2 bearing three alanine mutations. The similarity is limited to the last helix of FF2, along with its C-terminal connector of CA150 and the DNA recognition helix (3) of MAT2 (Fig. 7a and b). The crystal structure of the mutant MAT2 was determined as a ternary complex with its binding partner MATa1 and DNA.31 In this structure, the wild-type MAT2 DNA-interacting residues (S50, N51, and R54) were simultaneously mutated to alanines, thus affording a higher level of sequence homology with the FF construct used in this study (Fig. 7c).

405 structures currently in the PDB were the top seven hits. The next three hits were the yeast MAT2 structures (chain A of 1K61,32 chain C of 1APL,33 and chain D of 1K6132). These three have the same Z-scores (4.4) and RMSDs of 2.9, 2.8, and 2.8 Å, respectively. Unexpectedly, the FF domain of yeast URN1 (PDB ID 2JUC) had a Z-score of 4.1 and an RMSD of 3.0 Å and ranked even lower on the list. In comparison, searches using CA150 FF1 and FF3 structures did not give rise to as highly ranked homeodomain hits as those using FF2. When FF1 was used, the top homeodomain hit (no. 17 on the list) was PDB ID 2HI3, with a Z-score of 4.4 and an RMSD of 5.7 Å. In the case of FF3, the top hit (no. 59 on the list) was PDB ID 1YRN, with a Z-score of 3.9 and an RMSD of 3.2 Å. Overall, we demonstrated that FF2 could bind to DNA in vitro. Its resemblance to a DNA-binding homeodomain, the high positive charge content in this region of the protein, and the nuclear location of CA150 are consistent with its potential of DNA binding and its functional role in transcription.

Computer modeling was used to explore the hypothesis that our structure can bind to DNA. Since there has been no report on FF domains binding to DNA, we used the DNA duplex sequence reported by Ke et al. as a template in our trials.31 Results of energy minimization using steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods supported this hypothesis, which shows that, with some local adjustment, the relevant helix can indeed interact with the major groove of the DNA (results not shown). To experimentally test the potential DNA binding of CA150 FF1­3, we used a fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide duplex in an FP binding assay. We used the same oligonucleotide duplex employed by Ke et al. in their structural studies.31 Several protein samples, including wild-type FF1­3, GST­FF1­3, methylated FF1­3, and a mutant (E775A) in FF1­3, were used. As shown in Fig. 7d and Table 2, wildtype FF1­3 binds to DNA with a Kd of 3.87 M, close to that of MAT2­DNA binding (4.4 M).31 GST­ FF1­3 displayed a higher binding affinity with a Kd of 0.52 M, whereas methylated FF1­3 showed a marginally lower affinity with a Kd of 5.65 M. Interestingly, the E775A mutant had a binding affinity (Kd = 0.81 M) higher than that of wild type. In MAT2, E775 corresponds to N47, which is involved in interacting with several bases via either direct or water-mediated interactions. Without a structure of FF1­3 bound to DNA, it is difficult to rationalize this increased binding. One possible explanation is that, in the modeled structure, E775 is along the side of the helix that is rather hydrophobic, other than E775 itself. By changing it to an Ala, this side of the helix is now more hydrophobic, favoring the van der Waals interactions mediated by Ala residues 50 and 51 in MAT2. Also, the water molecules trapped between the protein and DNA, when E775 was not mutated to Ala, would be released, which is entropically favorable. Overall, consistent with MAT2-3A binding with DNA, the flexibility of this protein­DNA interface seems to tolerate other mutations in the protein sequence. It is not surprising that, the overall DNA binding is modest, since the optimal sequence is yet to be identified. Yet, FF1­3 has a higher binding affinity for DNA than for the peptide by more than 2 orders of magnitude (3.87 versus N400 M). Also, it has been shown that the mutant MAT2 alone binds to DNA with a rather weak affinity.31 In the presence of its partner MATa1, the binding affinity increased by 20-fold. Compared to classic homeodomains, even the wild-type MAT2 binds to DNA with modest affinity. Therefore, it is conceivable that fulllength CA150, alone or in complex with other associating factors, may exhibit a higher affinity for DNA binding. MATa1 and 2 belong to the large homeodomain transcription factor superfamily. DALI searches using individual FF domain structures indeed identified quite a few homeodomain proteins as structurally similar to FF domains. Significantly, a search using the structure of CA150 FF2 yielded a list on which seven of the eight FF domain NMR

Concluding Remarks
In this study, we present the first crystal structure of an FF domain and provide insights into the tandem nature of the first three FF domains in CA150. We reason that a specific conformation, as mediated by GST in the construct, might be required for the FF domains to bind to their peptide ligand WFHVEED. We also explored the potential of the DNA binding of FF proteins. Although FF domains are typically involved in protein­protein interactions, our results suggest that the activities of an FF domain may also include DNA binding. Future investigations are necessary to identify the DNA binding sites, as well as relevant protein partners in vivo. In summary, our results are consistent with a model in which the versatile CA150, as an assistant to RNAP II, functions as a scaffold through its multiple protein modules to recruit other transcription and mRNA processing factors and couples the two processes near the polymerase.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression and purification The DNA sequence encoding residues 661­845 of human CA150 (GenBank accession number AAB80727) was amplified by PCR and inserted into a pGEX-6P vector (GE Healthcare). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange (Stratagene), and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) was used as host, and the cells were grown at 37 °C until the OD600 of the culture had reached 0.7­0.8. Expression of the fusion protein was induced using 0.1 mM IPTG, and the cells were allowed to grow at 18 °C overnight. All of the subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in buffer GA

406
[50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.1 mM PMSF, and 0.7 mg/ml pepstatin A] and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation to remove unlysed cells and cell debris, the supernatant fraction of the cell lysate was applied to a Glutathione S-Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with buffer GA. After extensive washing of the column, the fusion protein was eluted with buffer GB (buffer GA with 10 mM reduced glutathione). The fusion protein was digested by PreScission protease overnight. Digestion products were applied onto an SP Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with buffer SA [20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, and 0.7 mg/ml pepstatin A], and separated with a linear gradient of 0­500 mM KCl in buffer SA. The fractions containing FF1­3 were pooled, concentrated to a minimal volume, and applied onto a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with GFB buffer [20 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA]. The peak fractions were pooled, concentrated to more than 20 mg/ml, aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at - 80 °C. Reductive lysine methylation Reductive methylation reaction was performed essentially as published previously.22 Briefly, purified FF1­3 protein was diluted with the methylation buffer [50 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) and 250 mM NaCl] to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. To each milliliter of the diluted protein solution, 20 l of freshly prepared 1 M dimethylamine­ borane complex (Fluka) and 40 l of 1 M formaldehyde (Fluka) were added. The reaction was carried out on ice for 2 h. Then 20 l of 1 M dimethylamine­borane complex and 40 l of 1 M formaldehyde were added for each milliliter of the reaction, which was allowed to continue for another 2 h. Then another 20 l of 1 M dimethylamine­ borane complex per milliliter of solution was added, and the reaction solution was kept on ice overnight. Finally, the reaction mixture was subjected to another round of gel filtration using a Superdex 75 column preequilibrated with the GFB buffer. Mass spectrometry One microgram of native or chemically methylated FF1­ 3 protein was injected onto a 1 mm × 50 mm C18 Vydac 218MS5105 reverse-phase HPLC column and eluted with a linear gradient in a 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile buffer system. The eluent from the column was directly infused into an Agilent LC-MSD TrapSL ion-trap mass spectrometer for electrospray ionization and mass analysis. Masses were deconvoluted from the observed charge state envelopes using Bruker liquid chromatography­ mass spectrometry data analysis software. Protein crystallization Lysine-methylated CA150 FF1­3 was subjected to crystallization trials at 4 °C using the "hanging-drop" vapor-diffusion method. Crystals were obtained by mixing 1 l of 10­15 mg/ml protein, 1 l of reservoir solution [50 mM bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 50 mM ammonium sulfate, and 30% pentaerythritol ethoxylate (Hampton Research)], and 0.5 l of 5 mM ATP (without pH adjustment). The best crystals, with a typical size of

Crystal Structure of Three Tandem FF Domains 400 m × 400 m × 150 m, were obtained in about a week. SeMet-substituted FF1­3 was also purified and crystallized under similar conditions. Data collection, processing, and structure determination FF1­3 crystals were treated with a series of cryoprotection solutions with 5­20% polyethylene glycol 400 (in 5% increments) in the reservoir solution and flash frozen in liquid N2. Diffraction data were collected at beamlines A1 and F1 of the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS; Ithaca, NY) and beamline 8.3.1 of the Advanced Light Source (Berkeley, CA), using ADSC charge-coupled device Quantum detectors. Data were processed and reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK programs.34 The crystals belong to space group P622, with cell dimensions of a = 141.30 Å, b = 141.30 Å, c = 155.42 Å,  = 90°,  = 90°, and  = 120°. There are two molecules in each asymmetric unit. Heavy-atom positions were located and refined against a Se-SAD data set collected at the selenium edge (0.9796 Å) using the Phaser module35 of PHENIX.36,37 Solvent modification was carried out using the Resolve module38 of PHENIX. The resultant electron density map was of excellent quality, enabling us to build all of the residues of one molecule and most of the residues of the other molecule, with casual guidance from individual FF domain NMR structures. Manual model building was performed using programs O39 and Coot,40 and refinement was performed using PHENIX. The final model contains all of the construct residues, except for residues 737­757 in the first molecule. In addition, the five residues GLPSP in each molecule (introduced from cloning) are included. Model quality was assessed using PROCHECK41 in the CCP4 suite.42 Most of the residues are in the most favored region (92.0%) or additionally allowed region (7.7%), and none is in the disallowed region. Peptide synthesis Two peptides (WFHVEED and AWFHVEED) were synthesized using manual solid-phase Fmoc methodology. The former was used in crystallization experiments, whereas the latter was labeled at the N-terminus, with 5carboxy-fluorescein as amide for FP binding studies. These peptides were purified and their identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Fluorescence polarization FP experiments were performed, as previously described,43 to measure binding between the peptide and the protein. Briefly, 50 l of 20 nM fluorescent-labeled peptide in 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, and 1% NP-40 was placed in the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. To each well, we added 50 l of a protein solution of up to 2 mM concentration in the same buffer. FP was then read in a Tecan Polarian plate reader. With the use of Prism (GraphPad Software), milliP values were plotted against the protein concentrations, and affinity values were obtained from nonlinear regression analysis in "one-site-specific binding" mode, as defined by Prism. For FP studies on DNA binding, the same procedure was followed, with the following modifications: 10 l of 20 nM fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide duplex was mixed with 10 l of a protein sample up to 0.66 mM in the wells of a 384-well plate. The sequences of the two strands

Crystal Structure of Three Tandem FF Domains of the duplex are 5-(fluorescein) ACATGTAAAAATTTACATCA-3 and 5-TTGATGTAAATTTTTACATG-3, respectively. MALS and dynamic light scattering Purified FF1­3 and GST­FF1­3 were applied to a Superdex 200 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 250 mM NaCl. Light scattering and refractive index signals were measured using a Wyatt Optilab and Dawn EOS system. Scattering curves were processed using the Astra software package provided.44,45 Purified FF1­3 and GST­FF1­3 proteins at 10 mg/ml in the GFB buffer were centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at a speed of 13,200g. Fifteen microliters of a protein solution was transferred to a quartz cuvette and allowed to equilibrate to 4 °C before taking an average of 20 readings with a DynaPro instrument (Protein Solutions). Data were analyzed using Dynamics software suite (Protein Solutions). Computer modeling A structural model of FF1­3 was superimposed onto that of the mutant MAT2 as in the MATa1­2­DNA complex (PDB ID 1LE8),31 based on the sequence alignment shown in Fig. 7c. After the potentials had been set using the Amber99 force field in InsightII (Accelrys, Inc.), the DNA duplex and CA150 residues 718­800 (FF2 and its C-terminal extension) were combined as an assembly and subjected to 5000 steps each of steepest descent and conjugate gradient minimization using a distance-dependent dielectric. In a separate experiment, the starting FF-DNA assembly was soaked with a layer of water molecules 6 Å thick. The same minimization protocol was used, except that no distance dependence was employed. Accession number Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB with accession number 3HFH.
