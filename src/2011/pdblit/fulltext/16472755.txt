1. Structure The RP2 gene encodes a ubiquitously expressed 350 amino acid protein, RP2 (Schwahn et al., 1998; Chapple et al., 2000). RP2 has functional dual acylation sites at its N-terminus and a region of homology to tubulin-specific cofactor C (TBCC) (30.4% identity over 151 amino acids, aa42­aa192; Fig. 1A). Within this region of homology, TBCC and RP2 also display similarity to cyclase associated proteins (CAPs). This similarity suggests the presence of a putative novel protein domain that has been designated a CARP motif (smart00673.9). The CARP motif is present in RP2 as a tandem repeat. The structure of the C-terminus of CAP, which contains the CARP domain, has been solved and is a right handed b helix (PDB 1k8fA). This domain in RP2 may have a similar structure (Fig. 1B). The C-terminus of RP2 has similarity to nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) (34% identity over 95 amino acids, aa251­aa346; (Fig. 1A)). This similarity is sufficient to model part of the domain on the known NDK structure (Fig. 1C). Post-translational acylation modifications of myristoylation and palmitoylation result in the protein being localized predominantly at the plasma membrane (Chapple et al., 2000; Grayson et al., 2002; Fig. 1A). 2. Function The function of RP2 is not completely understood but considerable progress has been made toward defining the localization of the protein and the significance of its TBCC homology domain. Cellular studies of RP2 localization show that the majority of RP2 is targeted to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Targeting is mediated by post-translational acyl modifications of myristoylation and palmitoylation at the

N-terminus (Chapple et al., 2000; Fig. 1A). Immunohistochemical analyses of human retina revealed that RP2 decorates the plasma membranes of all retinal cell types (Grayson et al., 2002). Acylation of RP2 appears to be critical for its function in the retina. A pathogenic mutation in the N-terminus of the protein, amino acid deletion S6 (DS6) disrupts the consensus sequence for N-terminal myristoylation and the mutant RP2 protein (DS6 RP2) was not correctly targeted to the plasma membrane in transfected cells (Chapple et al., 2000). There is evidence that RP2 has some functional conservation with TBCC. TBCC is an essential component of the tubulin biogenesis pathway. TBCC acts in concert with four other cofactors (TBCA, TBCB, TBCD and TBCE) to facilitate the assembly of alpha/beta tubulin heterodimers and to stimulate the GTPase activity of beta tubulin leading to the formation of native, newly made tubulin heterodimers. TBCC and TBCD in combination have also been shown to be a GTPase activator (GAP) for native tubulin. Bartolini and colleagues have shown that RP2 can partially substitute for the function of TBCC in these in vitro reactions. RP2 was able to replace TBCC function and stimulate the GAP activity of native tubulin in the presence of TBCD (Bartolini et al., 2002). RP2 was unable, however, to replace TBCC function in the assembly of the heterodimers (Bartolini et al., 2002). The significance of the ability of RP2 to partially substitute for TBCC function in vitro is unclear; however, it is clear that this functional conservation could be critical to RP2 function. The R118 residue of RP2 is conserved with the R262 residue in TBCC and it has been suggested that this residue could act as the common active site of an `arginine finger' motif that is found in GAPs. Mutation of this residue in both proteins (RP2R118H; TBCC-R262A) abolished the tubulin-GAP activity of both RP2 and TBCC (Bartolini et al., 2002). The R118 residue in RP2 is the site of the most common pathogenic missense mutation in this protein, implying it is a vital residue for RP2 function in the retina. RP2 has also been shown to interact with ADP ribosylation factor-like 3 (Arl3) (Bartolini et al., 2002). The mammalian Arl

night blindness, followed by peripheral retinal degeneration and eventually, loss of central vision. The majority of pathogenic RP2 mutations are truncating mutations, and of the known missense mutations most are found in the TBCC homology domain. As discussed, mutations that disrupt the acylation of RP2 (DS6) and its tubulin GAP activity (R118H) are pathogenic. The functional importance of the putative C-terminal NDK domain has not yet been explored; however, a pathogenic missense mutation of a residue conserved with NDK (L253R) has been reported (OMIM 312600), implying an important functional role. RP2 is ubiquitously expressed but as yet, no other systemic, non-ocular phenotype has been associated with mutations in the gene. This suggests that RP2 either has a unique retinal-specific function or a redundant role in other tissues. 4. Future studies

family is part of the Ras-related small GTP-binding superfamily of proteins. Arl2, which is closely related to Arl3, interacts with TBCD and is thought to regulate tubulin-GAP activity of TBCC and TBCD. The observation that the interaction between non-myristoylated RP2 and Arl3 was enhanced when Arl3 was in its GTP-bound `active' state, suggests that RP2 is an Arl3 effector (Bartolini et al., 2002). Interestingly, Arl3 is localized to the photoreceptor connecting cilium in rod and cone photoreceptors, decorates microtubules and co-purified with microtubules from bovine brain, suggesting it is a microtubule associated protein (MAP) (Grayson et al., 2002). Therefore, the interaction with Arl3 provides another link between RP2 and the cytoskeleton. Collectively these data suggest that one of the main functions of RP2 may be to integrate interactions between the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton. 3. Disease involvement Mutations in RP2 cause X-linked Retinitis Pigmentosa (XLRP) (Schwahn et al., 1998; OMIM 312600). XLRP is the most severe form of retinitis pigmentosa with early age of onset and rapid disease progression. An early symptom of disease is

We have gained insight into how certain pathogenic mutations in RP2 may cause disease by perturbing either the function or localization of the protein. To improve our understanding of RP2 function it will be important to determine the site of the RP2­Arl3 interaction within the retina and the functional consequences of this interaction. Importantly, RP2 and Arl3 are widely expressed proteins and the basis of the retinal specificity of XLRP remains to be determined. Identification of other RP2 interacting proteins and functional analyses of the C-terminal domain of RP2 may help to clarify the function of RP2 in retina. References
