The three-dimensional structure of the R form of rabbit liver fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-Pase; E.C. 3.1.3.11) has been determined by a combination of heavy-atom and molecular-replacement methods. A model, which includes 2394 protein atoms and 86 water molecules, has been re®ned Ê at 2.3 A resolution to a crystallographic R factor of 0.177. The root-mean-square deviations of bond distances and angles Ê from standard geometry are 0.012 A and 1.7 , respectively. This structural result, in conjunction with recently redetermined amino-acid sequence data, unequivocally establishes that the rabbit liver enzyme is not an aberrant bisphosphatase as once believed, but is indeed homologous to other Fru-1,6Pases. The root-mean-square deviation of the C atoms in the rabbit liver structure from the homologous atoms in the pig kidney structure complexed with the product, fructose Ê 6-phosphate, is 0.7 A. Fru-1,6-Pases are homotetramers, and the rabbit liver protein crystallizes in space group I222 with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The structure contains a single endogenous Mg2+ ion coordinated by Glu97, Asp118, Asp121 and Glu280 at the site designated metal site 1 in pig kidney Fru-1,6-Pase R-form complexes. In addition, two sulfate ions, which are found at the positions normally occupied by the 6-phosphate group of the substrate, as well as the phosphate of the allosteric inhibitor AMP appear to provide stability. Met177, which has hydrophobic contacts with the adenine moiety of AMP in pig kidney T-form complexes, is replaced by glycine. Binding of a non-hydrolyzable substrate analog, -methyl-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, at the catalytic site is also examined.

1. Introduction
Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-Pase; d-fructose 1,6bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase; E.C. 3.1.3.11) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the  anomer of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to d-fructose 6-phosphate and inorganic phosphate (Benkovic & deMaine, 1982). It was ®rst described by Gomori (1943) who separated it from other phosphatases present in mammalian tissues. Fru-1,6-Pase is involved in several metabolic pathways. In mammalian liver and kidney, it catalyzes a key regulatory step in gluconeogenesis (Marcus, 1981; Van Schaftingen & Hers, 1981; Benkovic & deMaine, 1982; Tejwani, 1983; Van Schaftingen, 1987), and it also serves a gluconeogenic function in yeasts and in Escherichia coli, where it is necessary for growth on substances such as glycerol and succinate. In eukaryotic plants, a gluconeogenic Fru-1,6-Pase found in the cytosol takes part in sucrose synthesis from triose phosphates, while an isozyme within the chloroplasts is necessary for

regeneration of ribulose bisphosphate in the pentose phosphate pathway or Calvin cycle leading to photosynthetic carbon dioxide assimilation. This enzyme also functions in the Calvin cycle in photosynthetic and chemoautotrophic bacteria. Active forms of mammalian Fru-1,6-Pase are homotetramers with subunit sizes of about 36 kDa (Tashima et al., 1972) and maximal activity either under alkaline conditions or near physiological (neutral) pH (Traniello et al., 1971). The alkaline form is the result of hydrolysis by lysosomal proteases during the isolation procedure (Pontremoli et al., 1973, 1974), and this hydrolysis can be mimicked by subtilisin digestion (Horecker et al., 1980). Intact neutral subunits can be cleaved at four sites in the region between residues 57 and 67, resulting in a shift of the optimum pH from 7.5 to 9.2 (Traniello et al., 1972). Evolutionary conservation of this protease-sensitive region suggests a physiological role (MacGregor et al., 1982). Although the signi®cance of protease sensitivity is still unclear, other aspects of Fru-1,6-Pase regulation are well documented. A divalent metal ion such as Mg2+, Mn2+ or Zn2+ is essential for activity (Gomori, 1943), and catalysis requires the formation of an enzyme±metal±substrate complex (Benkovic & deMaine, 1982). Although monovalent cations such as K+, NH or Tl+ are not required, their presence is 4 needed for maximal activity (Hubert et al., 1970). The enzyme is inhibited by noncompetitive AMP interaction with an allosteric site (Taketa & Pogell, 1965; Liu & Fromm, 1990) and by d-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) competition for the active site (Van Shaftingen & Hers, 1980). Although the ®rst partial sequences for rabbit liver Fru-1,6Pase were determined some time ago (Botelho et al., 1977; Suda et al., 1982; Xu et al., 1982), the complete amino-acid sequence of this 337-residue protein was determined only recently (Kaiser et al., 1996). Based on the earlier sequences, the rabbit liver protein appeared to differ from other vertebrate forms, including those of pig kidney (Marcus et al., 1982; Harrsch et al., 1985; Williams & Kantrowitz, 1992), sheep liver (Fisher & Thompson, 1983), rat liver (El-Maghrabi et al., 1988) and human and chicken liver (El-Maghrabi et al., 1993), to a greater degree than would be expected from the homology between these other forms. The recent complete sequence determination, however, showed that the extent of residue identity with the other vertebrate enzymes is high (85±91%) and that the rabbit liver enzyme is unique at only nine positions. As expected, residue identity is lower towards plant and yeast Fru-1,6-Pases (44±57%) and also towards the enzyme of prokaryotic forms (30±43%). Pig kidney Fru-1,6-Pase has been the subject of intense crystallographic study. R-form structures include the native apoprotein (Protein Data Bank code 2FBP; Ke et al., 1989; Ke, Thorpe et al., 1990) and complexes with the product Fru-6-P (5FBP; Ke, Zhang et al., 1991), the competitive inhibitor Fru-2,6-P2 (3FBP; Liang et al., 1992), the substrate Fru-1,6-P2 (1FBH; Zhang et al., 1993), the -substrate analog AhG-1,6-P2 plus Mg2+ (1FBC), Mn2+ (1FBD) or Zn2+ (1FBE; Zhang et al., 1993), the -substrate analog AhM-1,6-P2 plus Mg2+ (1FBF) or Mn2+ (1FBG; Zhang et al., 1993) and Tl+ ions (1FPK; Villeret, Huang, Fromm et al., 1995). T-form complexes with the allosteric inhibitor AMP include the binary complex (4FBP; Ke, Liang et al., 1991) and quaternary or higher complexes with the product Fru-6-P plus Mg2+ (1FBP; Ke, Zhang et al., 1990), the competitive inhibitor Fru-2,6-P2 plus Zn2+ (1FRP; Xue et al., 1994), the -substrate analog AhG-1,6-P2 plus several different concentrations of Mn2+ (1FPD, 1FDE, 1FDF, 1FDG; Villeret, Huang, Zhang & Lipscomb, 1995) or AhG-1,6-P2 plus the monovalent cations K+ (1FPI), Li+ and Tl+ (1FPJ) or Tl+ (1FPL; Villeret, Huang, Fromm et al., 1995). Comparative analyses of these R- and T-state structures have led to the development of theories for the mechanism of the allosteric transition (Zhang et al., 1994). The structures of several pig kidney mutant enzymes have also been determined. These structures include the T form of the Lys423Ala mutant (1FSA; Lu et al., 1996) and both the R form (1RDX) and T forms (1RDY and 1RDZ) of the Arg2433Ala mutant (Stec et al., 1996). Crystal structures have also been reported for the enzymes from human liver (1FTA; Gidh-Jain et al., 1994) and spinach chloroplast (1SPI; Villeret, Huang, Zhang, Xue et al., 1995). Although the crystallographic study of rabbit liver Fru-1,6Pase was initiated two decades ago (McPherson et al., 1977; Soloway & McPherson, 1978) and a tentative model was proposed (Weeks et al., 1988), inconsistencies between the early sequence data of the rabbit liver enzyme and the electron-density maps prevented complete interpretations for many years. Only after the complete sequence became available could the ambiguities in map interpretation be resolved with con®dence. The R-state crystal structure of neutral rabbit Ê liver Fru-1,6-Pase is reported here at 2.3 A resolution. This structure has as ligands not only an endogenous Mg2+ ion, but also sulfate ions at the positions normally occupied by phosphate in both the catalytic and allosteric sites.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Enzyme puri®cation and crystallization

Fru-1,6-Pase was puri®ed from fresh rabbit livers (Ulm et al., 1975) and activity was assayed at pH 7.5 and 9.2 to verify that the protein had not undergone partial proteolysis. Freshly isolated protein was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and washed thoroughly in Amicon stirred cells (over YM-10 membranes) with 25 mM Tris buffer in such a manner that any residual salt was diluted at least 10 000-fold. Crystallization by the vapor-diffusion method was performed in sandwich boxes using nine-well glass plates. Reservoirs containing 10±15% PEG 4000 solutions in 25 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) were equilibrated at ambient temperature against droplets containing mixtures of 10 ml protein solution at a concentration of 7±8 mg mlÀ1, 10 ml reservoir and 2 ml of 50± 200 mM ammonium sulfate. Crystals, typically 0.3 Â 0.4 Â 2.0 mm in size, appeared in 10±14 d. The addition of appropriate concentrations of ammonium sulfate to crystallization droplets was essential for the routine growth of diffractionquality crystals, and the careful washing of precipitated protein was necessary for reproducible results. The space group was determined to be I222 with unit-cell dimensions of

Ê a = 73.79, b = 80.05 and c = 131.82 A. The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains a single polypeptide chain (monomer or subunit) of 337 residues. Isomorphous heavyatom derivative crystals were prepared by addition of 1±2 ml of solutions containing heavy-atom compounds to droplets with native crystals and soaking for 2±7 d.
2.2. Data collection

X-ray diffraction data sets for native and heavy-atom derivative crystals were collected over a period of several years at three facilities: (i) an in-house single-channel Nonius CAD4 diffractometer with a sealed-tube Cu anode, (ii) a Siemens area detector with a rotating anode at the Midwest Crystallography Resource in the laboratory of Dr Edwin Westbrook at Argonne National Laboratory and (iii) a Mark III multiwire detector at the Resource for Crystallography located in the laboratory of Professor Nguyen Huu Xuong at the University of California, San Diego. All data were collected using Cu K radiation. The best native data set Ê (2.30 A resolution) was collected from one crystal on the Mark III detector. This data set was used to calculate all native electron-density maps and for the ®nal re®nement of the model. The derivative data sets were collected with the CAD4 and Siemens detectors. A summary of data-collection experiments is provided in Table 1.
2.3. Structure solution and re®nement

All computations necessary for structure solution, model building and re®nement were carried out on a Silicon Graphics Indigo R4000 Workstation. An initial electrondensity map of the molecule was constructed by the multiple isomorphous replacement method. Heavy-atom binding sites were determined by the HASSP routine and re®ned by HEAVY using the origin-removed Patterson technique (Terwilliger & Eisenberg, 1983). Minor binding sites were located by double-difference Fouriers. Origin correlation between the K3UO2F5 and KAu(CN)2 derivatives, as well as

independent con®rmation of the heavy-atom binding sites, came from the cross-difference Fourier synthesis. The PHASES software package (Furey & Swaminathan, 1990) was used to combine the phase information from the isomorphous and anomalous intensity data for both derivatives, to apply solvent ¯attening, to calculate ®nal combined phases and to Ê prepare an MIRAS-phased Fourier synthesis at 3.5 A resolution. Details of the phasing statistics are provided in Table 2. The protein±solvent boundary was clearly visible from this electron-density map, and many -helices and -sheets were interpretable. However, other regions of the density, in particular loops and turns, were poorly de®ned. At this time, the coordinates of the R form of pig kidney Fru-1,6-Pase (PDB code 2FBP; Ke et al., 1989) became available and a molecular-replacement solution was obtained using the È program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) and the 2FBP coordinates as the search model. This solution was further optimized manually by building an atomic model for the rabbit liver Fru1,6-Pase molecule into the ab initio electron-density map while using the molecular-replacement solution as a guide. The program CHAIN (Sack, 1988) was used for this purpose. When the complete revised rabbit-liver Fru-1,6-Pase sequence data became available (Kaiser et al., 1996), it was used to build the side chains into this density map. Structure factors calculated from the partially completed model were combined with the starting experimental phases using the PHASES package, and new electron-density maps were calculated in order to build through the regions of the molecule having poorly de®ned electron density or strong search-model bias. This process was continued until it was possible to account for the entire electron density in the asymmetric unit. No density could be located for the N-terminal residues Ala1±Pro5 or for the polypeptide segment corresponding to residues 54±71 (protease-sensitive area). Consequently, these regions were left out of the model, although it is clear from the sequence data (Kaiser et al., 1996) that these residues are present in the polypeptide chain. The same regions also exhibit disorder in the crystal structures of the pig kidney enzyme.

3.1. Overall structure

A difference electron-density map computed at this time showed three distinct peaks larger than water molecules. The ®rst such peak, which appeared to be sitting at the center of the coordinating acidic side chains of Glu97, Asp118, Asp121 and Glu280, was satisfactorily modeled as a Mg2+ ion. Attempts to model this density with a Mn2+ ion resulted in a negative residual density at that position and an isotopic temperature factor much higher than the average of the temperature factors of the neighboring atoms.

The asymmetric unit of this crystalline form of rabbit liver Fru-1,6-Pase contained one subunit of the homotetramer, 86 water molecules, one Mg2+ cation and two sulfate anions. A ribbon diagram depicting this structure is shown in Fig. 1. The protein molecule is situated in the I222 unit cell with the center of the tetramer at the origin or intersection of three twofold axes. Consequently, the tetramer, illustrated in Fig. 2, possesses exact D2 symmetry. The overall conformation of the monomer and the quaternary structure of the tetramer closely resemble those of the pig kidney structure (Ke et al., 1989). All crystalline forms of the pig kidney enzyme examined so far have two or four subunits in the asymmetric unit, and they exhibit pseudo, rather than crystallographically exact, D2

symmetry. The overall shape of the tetramer, consisting of subunits C1 to C4, has been described as a pseudohexagonal Ê disk with a thickness of 35 A. The folding pattern of a rabbit liver subunit can be described as two-domain /, in agreement with previous descriptions of the three-dimensional structure of the pig kidney enzyme. The secondary structure of the subunit is summarized in Table 4. The rabbit liver protein contains three short 310 helices (H5a, H5b and H8a) missing from the pig kidney structure. Domain 1, consisting of residues 1±200, is the allosteric AMP-binding domain, while residues 201±337 constitute domain 2, the catalytic domain, which is responsible for hydrolysis of the substrate. Domain 1 consists of three long -helices (H1±H3), a -sheet comprised of eight mixed strands (B1±B8) and two very short helical segments (H4 and H5). The -sheet direction is parallel to the axes of the long helices. Domain 2 also has a central -sheet with mixed strands (B9± B13). This sheet is ¯anked by -helices H7 and H8 on the side towards domain 1 and by helices H6 and H9 on the side towards the exterior of the molecule. From the point of view of the orientations of the -sheets and -helices, the two domains are rotated by roughly 90 with respect to each other. Overall, the secondary-structure elements of the molecule are distributed in ®ve layers, as previously described for the pig kidney apo protein (PDB code 2FBP; Ke et al., 1989).

deviations are nearly twice the estimated random errors in the positional parameters of the rabbit liver structure. If only domain 1 is used in the least-squares ®t, the r.m.s. deviation is Ê Ê 0.53 A for domain 1 itself and 0.86 A for domain 2, thereby indicating a small difference in relative orientation of the two domains between the rabbit liver and the R-state pig kidney structures. When the entire R-state monomers are ®tted, Ê signi®cant deviations (>1 A) of the C positions occur at (i) residues 24±26 (end of H1), (ii) residues 124±129 (H4), (iii) Ê residues 268±271 (average deviation $3.6 A; loop between B11 and H8) and (iv) the C-terminus. There are only two sequence differences between the rabbit and pig proteins in these regions (Arg253Gly and Gln3323Lys). Conformational differences marked by backbone deviations between the two structures are, therefore, not necessarily correlated with sequence changes. Instead, the regions of the rabbit liver structure with the greatest differences consist mainly of long loops or turns which have high isotropic temperature factors for the backbone as well as for the side-chain atoms. In fact, the four regions listed above all have poor electron density (little signi®cant density above the 1' level) and correspond to Ê areas with high average temperature factors (50±100 A2). The average isotropic thermal parameter for all backbone atoms is Ê 36.9 A2, a value somewhat higher than those reported for most pig kidney structures.

In contrast, when the monomers, dimers and tetramers of rabbit liver Fru-1,6-Pase were superimposed with the T-state pig kidney structure, the corresponding r.m.s. deviations were signi®cantly higher (Table 5), con®rming that the rabbit liver structure is in the R form. The r.m.s. deviations for monomerto-monomer comparison between the rabbit liver subunit and Ê T-state pig kidney monomers were around 1.1 A; the dimers Ê superimposed with similar r.m.s. deviations (1.2 A). Superposition of two tetramers, however, resulted in a much larger Ê overall deviation (3.2 A). These numbers are consistent with the observations that, although the R3T transition in the pig kidney enzyme involves a 17 rotation between the C1C2 and C3C4 dimers, there is only a small (3.4 ) rotation between two monomers comprising a dimer (Liang et al., 1993). Interestingly, when domain 2 of the R-state rabbit liver protein was superimposed by least-squares onto domain 2 of the T-state Ê pig kidney enzyme, the r.m.s. deviation was about 0.7 A, a value similar to the r.m.s. deviations between the R-state monomers. This is consistent with the observation that the AMP-induced R3T allosteric transition in the pig kidney enzyme does not cause any appreciable structural change within the catalytic domain. However, superposition of domain 1 alone results in a larger deviation because of rearrangement within domain 1 during the R3T transition (Liang et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 1994).

Mg2+ cation lies in a pocket formed by ®ve negatively charged residues (Glu97, Glu98, Asp118, Asp21 and Glu280). As illustrated in Fig. 4, the Mg2+ is coordinated by the carboxylate side chains of four of these residues. Four of the metal ligands are the same as those constituting the so-called metal site 1 in the AhG-1,6-P2 and AhM-1,6-P2 ternary complexes of the pig kidney enzyme (Zhang et al., 1993), but the ®fth ligand (Glu97 OE1) is replaced by the 1-phosphate oxygen O11 in the substrate-analog complexes. Mn2+ and Zn2+ ions at site 1 do not coordinate atom Asp121 OD1 (Zhang et al., 1993). The Ê metal±oxygen distances are all in the 2.30±2.45 A range, and it is signi®cant that these distances were not restrained to any speci®c length during the re®nement. The average metal± Ê oxygen distance of 2.37 A is somewhat shorter than the 2+ Ê average Mg ±oxygen distances (2.5±2.6 A) observed in the pig kidney R-form complexes (PDB codes 1FBC and 1FBF; Zhang et al., 1993). The coordination geometry could be described as a distorted tetrahedron having an additional ligand from Glu97 or as a distorted octahedron in which the sixth ligand from the bottom (as viewed in Fig. 4) is missing. There are a few water molecules in the vicinity of the missing sixth ligand, and the closest such O atom is at a distance of Ê 3.71 A from the metal ion.

3.4. Sulfate binding

A sulfate ion is located (Fig. 5) at the position occupied by the 6-phosphate moiety in complexes of the pig kidney enzyme with product (Ke, Zhang et al., 1990), with the competitive inhibitor Fru-2,6-P2 (Liang et al., 1992) and with substrate or substrate analogs (Zhang et al., 1993). As illustrated in Fig. 6, this sulfate is coordinated by hydrogen bonds from the proton-donating side chains of Asn212, Tyr215, Tyr244 and Tyr264 as well as by salt-bridging interactions with the side chain of Arg243 from an adjacent crystallographically related subunit. In addition, several well ordered water molecules have been located in the vicinity of this sulfate ion, and some of these waters (i.e. W84 and W86) are within hydrogen-bonding distance of sulfate O atoms. The ®ve sulfate-binding residues, along with Lys274, bind to the

6-phosphate group in the pig kidney complexes. In this rabbit Ê liver structure, the N atom of the Lys274 side chain is 3.68 A from the closest sulfate O atom (see Fig. 5). All six phosphatecoordinating residues are strictly conserved in the mammalian primary structures (Liang et al., 1992). A second sulfate ion is located at a position corresponding to the allosteric site of pig kidney AMP complexes (Ke, Zhang et al., 1990; Ke, Liang et al., 1991; Xue et al., 1994; Villeret, Huang, Zhang & Lipscomb, 1995). As illustrated in Fig. 7, the O atoms of this sulfate form ®ve hydrogen-bonding contacts with the main-chain amides of residues Thr27, Gly 28, Glu29 and Met30, as well as three additional contacts with the side chains of Thr27, Lys112 and Tyr113. The backbone N atom of Gly28 forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with two of the sulfate O atoms. These interactions of the sulfate ion with the rabbit liver protein are very similar to those of the phosphate moiety of AMP as observed in the complexes of the pig kidney enzyme.

position of the substrate analog in the cleft are consistent with re®ned models of Fru-6-P and Fru-2,6-P2 in pig kidney complexes (Ke, Zhang et al., 1991; Liang et al., 1992). The interactions of the Mg2+ ion and the 6-phosphate moiety with protein atoms are similar to the interactions already described for Mg2+ ion (Fig. 4) and for sulfate (Fig. 6) in the absence of the substrate analog. No strong electron density for the 1-phosphate could be located. Modeling suggests that this phosphate group could interact with the Ser124 hydroxyl and the Lys274 amino groups.

4. Discussion
The crystal structure determination reported here, along with the report of the primary structure (Kaiser et al., 1996), resolve the con¯icts between previous rabbit liver Fru-1,6-Pase sequence data and the sequences of related species. The rabbit liver enzyme has now been shown to be a normal member of this enzyme family, with its overall primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures similar to those of the extensively studied pig kidney enzyme. All of the residues critical for metal, substrate and competitive-inhibitor binding are present, including residues Asp121, Asn125 and Glu280, which were missing in the original rabbit liver sequence data. The 36 amino-acid differences between the rabbit liver and pig kidney enzymes, including 22 modi®cations in -helical or sheet regions, result in only minor conformational changes. Instead, the largest differences are observed in loops with high thermal motion. The rabbit liver enzyme has three additional short 310-helical regions. The presence of an apparent single Mg2+ cation in the rabbit liver structure is noteworthy. This ion re®nes well as a fully occupied Mg2+ site, but it re®nes poorly when modeled as Mn2+ or as NH . It displays a coordination pattern typical of 4 Mg2+ but not of Mn2+ or Zn2+ (Zhang et al., 1993). No Mg2+

A molecule of the non-hydrolyzable substrate analog Ê -methyl-Fru-1,6-P2 was modeled into the 4 A difference electron density at the catalytic cleft of domain 2. On account of the low resolution of the data for the substrate-analog complex, no attempt was made to re®ne this structure. Two of the three largest peaks in the difference map were used to position the -methyl-Fru-1,6-P2 molecule, as shown in Fig. 8. In this model, the largest of the three difference densities coincides with the furanose ring; the other two densities are near the 6-phosphate and the Mg2+ ion. However, the density for Mg2+ does not superimpose on the Mg2+ position obtained from the re®nement of the structure in the absence of the Ê substrate analog. This density is shifted by about 1 A. Although movements of protein atoms in the catalytic cleft often accompany complexation, the overall orientation and

was added during the isolation or crystallization procedures, both of which involved extensive dialysis and other procedures designed to remove salt. This suggests that Mg2+ is intrinsic to the rabbit liver enzyme. It was shown by binding studies (Benkovic et al., 1978) that there are two divalent metal binding sites per subunit, a high-af®nity structural site (M1) and a low-af®nity catalytic site (M2). However, recent kinetic (Liu & Fromm, 1990) and crystallographic data (Zhang et al., 1993) both indicate that, although two Mn2+ and Zn2+ cations bind per subunit, Mg2+ binds only to the M1 site. The M1 site is occupied in this rabbit liver structure. Two sulfate ions, the presence of which appears to be necessary for the growth of diffraction-quality crystals, are bound to the sites occupied by the 6-phosphate moiety of the substrate and the phosphate group of the allosteric inhibitor AMP in pig kidney Fru-1,6-Pase structures. Least-squares ®tting experiments with pig kidney R- and T-state models clearly demonstrate that this rabbit liver enzyme structure has an active R conformation, and the sulfate bound to the allosteric site does not appear to cause any structural rearrangement. The hydrogen bonds from the active-site sulfate to residues Asn212, Tyr215, Tyr244 and Tyr264 of one monomer, coupled with simultaneous interaction of this sulfate with Arg243 of another monomer, may provide the conformational stability necessary for diffraction-quality crystals. Although mammalian Fru-1,6-Pases are all regulated by AMP, the af®nity of the enzyme for this allosteric inhibitor varies widely, and even greater variation is observed in enzymes from distantly related species where AMP has little or no effect. For example, Ki values for AMP range from below 1 mM for the rabbit skeletal muscle enzyme (Black et al., 1972), through 10±20 mM for the liver and kidney enzymes (Colombo & Marcus, 1973) and 80±200 mM for the yeast enzymes (Marcus et al., 1988), to no AMP inhibition for chloroplast (Preiss et al., 1967; Buchanan et al., 1971) and bumblebee ¯ight muscle (Newsholme et al., 1972) enzymes. The residues which interact with divalent cations, substrate and the 2-phosphate group of Fru-2,6-P2 are strongly conserved but, as might be expected from the variation in AMP sensitivity, conservation of the AMP-binding residues (17±31, 112±113, 140, 160 and 177) is low (Ke, Liang et al., 1991). Interestingly, the longest string of amino-acid differences between the rabbit liver and pig kidney enzymes occurs in the tripeptide at positions 177±179 where the Met±Val±Asn sequence in the pig kidney protein is replaced by Gly±Gly±Ser in the rabbit liver form. The purine base of AMP bound at the allosteric site of the pig kidney enzyme makes a van der Waals contact with the Met177 side chain (Ke, Liang et al., 1991). Although no signi®cant deviation of backbone atoms in this region was observed when the two structures were superimposed, the change of Met177 and Val178 to glycine residues increases the space available in the vicinity of the purine base and reduces the hydrophobic character of the AMP-binding pocket of the rabbit liver structure. Further evidence that the Met177 interaction is not critical for AMP inhibition comes from the unchanged apparent Ki for AMP in the Met1773Ala mutant of the human liver enzyme (Gidh-Jain et al., 1994).
