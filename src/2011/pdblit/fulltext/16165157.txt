Abstract Sequences of 40 very diverse representatives of the h-crystallin ­ small heat-shock protein (h-Hsp) superfamily are compared. Their characteristic C-terminal `h-crystallin domain' of 80 ­ 100 residues contains short consensus sequences that are highly conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. There are, in addition, some positions that clearly distinguish animal from non-animal h-Hsps. The h-crystallin domain is predicted to consist of two hydrophobic i-sheet motifs, separated by a hydrophilic region which is variable in length. Combination of a conserved h-crystallin domain with a variable N-terminal domain and C-terminal extension probably modulates the properties of the various h-Hsps as stress-protective and structural oligomeric proteins. Phylogeny reconstruction indicates that multiple h-Hsps were already present in the last common ancestor of pro- and eukaryotes. It is suggested that during eukaryote evolution, animal and non-animal h-Hsps originated from different ancestral gene copies. Repeated gene duplications gave rise to the multiple h-Hsps present in most organisms. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Since 1894 h-crystallin was known as a large and lonely protein, living a secluded life with its fellow crystallins in the vertebrate eye lens [1]. Although contributing to the brilliance of the lens, it had a somewhat dull image. Being vaguely categorized as a structural protein, it could not boast of any exciting enzymatic or otherwise appealing activities. A brighter future loomed in 1982, when Drosophila small heat-shock proteins (sHsps) were found to share conspicuous sequence similarities with h-crystallin, reflecting a common evolutionary ancestry [2]. h-Crystallin, or rather hB-crystallin, one of the two types of subunits, then rapidly gained prestige by a series of discoveries. The finding of considerable levels of hB-crystallin outside the lens, notably in heart and striated muscle [3], and the increased

levels of this protein in various neurodegenerative diseases (see Ref. [4]), raised the interest of the biomedical community. The fact that hB-crystallin can be induced by heat and other stresses, and conveys thermotolerance to cells, like other sHsps, gave an indication of its physiological importance [5]. Finally, by virtue of its ability to prevent the aggregation of unfolding proteins [6], h-crystallin got recognition as a molecular chaperone, be it that purists consider its activity, not readily being able to refold proteins, as only chaperone-like. As a consequence of all this, h-crystallin now is a respected and quite representative member of the ever-growing family of small heat-shock proteins. To better understand the structure and function of h-crystallin, it is useful to trace the evolutionary roots of this protein, and know the widely diverging properties of its relatives. This paper summarily updates earlier overviews of the molecular evolution and phylogeny of h-crystalin and other sHsps [7­14].

Fig. 1. Alignment of the five known human representatives of the h-crystallin ­ small heat-shock protein superfamily. An initial alignment of the sequences was obtained using the program PILEUP [78] and improved by manual editing. Identical residues in at least four of the sequences are in black; similar residues in all five sequences in gray [79]. Secondary structures, as indicated by arrows (i-sheets) and cylinders (h-helices), were predicted according to Rost et al. [80]. The last eight, ten and 18 residues of hA-, hB- crystallin and Hsp27 (positions 256 and onwards), respectively, are highly flexible extensions [26,27]. For accession numbers, see legends to Fig. 2.

2. -crystallin and the vertebrate small heat-shock proteins In mammals, three proteins have now been described that share conspicuous sequence identity with hA- and hB-crystallin. The first reported and best known is Hsp27, depending on species and authors also indicated as Hsp25 or Hsp28 [15]. It closely resembles hB-crystallin in most

structural and functional respects [16]. More recently came p20 [17], now indicated as Hsp20 [18]. The latest addition is HspL27, as yet only known from human heart [19]. In the rat lens, hA-crystallin, hB-crystallin and Hsp27 reach levels of 24, 14 and 1% of total protein, respectively [20­22], where Hsp20 is very low [17]. Outside the lens, hA-crystallin is only present in trace amounts, while the others occur in virtually all

Black and gray columns are used when 50% or more of the residues at a given position are identical or chemically similar, respectively. As similar residues are only considered: D/E, D/N, K/R, I/L/V, G/A, S/T and F/Y/W. Secondary structures were predicted as in Fig. 1. Sequences, data base accession numbers and references (if not given here they can be found in [11,13]) are: Homo sapiens hA-crystallin (P02489), H. sapiens hB-crystallin (P02511), H. sapiens hsp20 [17], Homo sapiens hsp27 (P04792), P. lucida hsp27 (U85501) [39], Drosophila melanogaster hsp27 (P02518), D. melanogaster l(2)efl (X77635) [53], Artemia franciscana p26 [54], Xenopus lae6is hsp30c (P30218) [43], Poeciliopsis lucida hsp30b (U85502) [39], Halocynthia roretzi HR-29 (JX0258) [60], Schistosoma mansoni p40-2 N- and C-terminal domains (M96866) [50], H. sapiens hspl27 (U15590) [19], Caenorhabditis elegans hsp16 (P06581), C. elegans hsp12.3 (Z68342), Acanthocheilonema 6iteae AV25 (S29691; W.

To avoid undue lengthening of the alignment, a 66-residue sequence is left out after position 51 in Neurospora hsp30, and a 7-residue sequence after position 64 in Toxoplasma hsp30. The sequence from position 109 till 151 for Schistosoma n2 actually constitutes the connecting peptide between the duplicated h-crystallin domains in this protein.

tissues, be it at different levels. hB-Crystallin, Hsp27 and Hsp20 are all most abundant in the slow-twitch soleus muscle (at 2.8, 0.4 and 1.3%, respectively), but also in heart and diaphragm.

Unlike hB-crystallin, Hsp27 and Hsp20 reach appreciable levels--up to 0.4%--in tissues containing smooth muscle, like bladder and rectum, too. Where hB-crystallin, Hsp20 and Hsp27 occur in

the same tissue, they are isolated as heteromeric complexes [17,23]. On basis of their sequence identity, these five mammalian sHsps can thus be considered as homologous proteins, or--in more precise evolution-

ary jargon--paralogous proteins, having originated by gene duplications from a common ancestral gene. The alignment of these five protein sequences, as known from man (Fig. 1), immediately highlights the characteristic sequence features

155

of the whole h-crystallin­sHsp superfamily. An uninterrupted block of sequence similarity extends from around positions 150 to 235. This block indeed contains consensus regions that are the hallmark of the superfamily, as described in the next section. In contrast, only at the expense of extensive gaps in the alignment, some scattered identities and similarities can be discerned among the N-terminal sequences of all five proteins. Clearer similarities in this region are shared by the h-crystallins, Hsp20 and Hsp27, notably the motif RLFDQxFG (positions 48­55). Also the C-terminal regions beyond position 235 are variable in length and sequence, although a TIPIT-like motif is shared by the h-crystallins and Hsp27 (positions 248­ 252). There is evidence that the variable N-terminal region and the conserved C-terminal region form two distinct structural domains [14,24,25], while the last 8 ­ 18 residues of the variable C-terminal tails, from position 256 onwards, flex freely from the surface of the multimeric complexes [26,27]. As indicated in Fig. 1, seven b-sheets are predicted to occur in the C-terminal domain, and another one is formed by the TIPIT-motif. In contrast, two h-helical regions are predicted in the N-terminal sequences shared by all five proteins, while HspL27 might have two additional h-helices. It seems logical to assume that the five known mammalian sHsps fulfil distinct and important functions. For hA-crystallin, almost exclusively and abundantly expressed in the eye lens, in mixed complexes with hB-crystallin, the obvious task seems to maintain the transparancy of this organ by keeping old and denaturing proteins from aggregating [6]. The only abnormality when the hA-crystallin gene is disrupted in mice, seems indeed the early development of lens opacities [28]. It should be realized, however, that various lower vertebrates, like bony fishes [29] and geckos [30], keep their lenses perfectly transparent with no or hardly any h-crystallin present. The relatively high levels of hB-crystallin in heart and other tissues, has suggested important roles in stress protection. It is somewhat sobering then that, like in so many other knockout experiments, no phenotypic abnormalities are obvious --not even cataract--when the hB-crystallin gene is inactivated [31]. Moreover, its absence is not compensated by increased expression of the functionally related Hsp27 or Hsp20. Yet, the suggestion that hB-crystallin is redundant and dispensable is premature. More subtle selective advantages of the presence of hB- crystallin may

only become apparent under real-life, long-term evolutionary pressure. Although a vast literature exists about the physiological properties of Hsp27 and hB-crystallin [15,32], this does not yet provide the insight for a meaningful comparison of their possible roles, let alone those of Hsp20 and HspL27. The presence of five sHsps in mammals is the result of fortuitous gene duplications in the course of evolution. At least one copy of the duplicated genes should maintain the original function, if this is indeed an essential one. The other copies are free to change by random mutational processes. This may--by chance--result in gene products with selectively advantageous novel properties. Alternatively, duplicate genes may linger for many million years without noticeable changes in their products and without any obvious advantage [33], or gradually become obsolete as pseudogenes. Pseudogenes for Hsp27 have indeed been reported, but they are located on chromosome 9 and the X chromosome, while the active Hsp27 gene is on chromosome 3 [34]. This indicates that they have originated by retroposition, rather than by duplication and subsequent degeneration. The chromosomal localization of the single-copy gene for Hsp20 [17] has not been reported, but the genes for hA- and hB-crystallin and HspL27 are located on chromosomes 21, 11 and 5, respectively [19,35,36]. hA-, hB-crystallin and Hsp20 are each others closest relatives among the five mammalian sHsps, as will become evident in the next section. Orthologous hA- and hB-crystallins--that is, encoded by corresponding genes, separated at the time of speciation--are known from mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and cartilaginous fishes [37]. Hsp20 has only been reported from human and rat, but orthologs can likewise be expected to occur in all vertebrates. Hsp27 is somewhat more distantly related, and orthologs have been reported from mammals, birds and bony fishes [13,38,39]. The presence of these sHsps from fishes to mammals indicates that the gene duplications responsible for their origin occurred at least 450 million years ago. These gene duplications may have occurred during the two rounds of extensive gene duplications, both tandem duplications and tetraploidy, that probably occurred early in vertebrate evolution [40­42]. Finally, HspL27 is as yet only known from man, but seems to be a much older offshoot. It probably is ubiquitous in vertebrates, and orthologs might be expected in invertebrates as well.

One may wonder whether additional sHsps are likely to be found in man and other mammals. This might well be the case, because a distinct sHsp gene, Hsp30, is present in multiple copies in the amphibian Xenopus [43] and the bony fish Poeciliopsis [39]. This Hsp30 branch of the superfamily must thus have been present already in the common vertebrate ancestor. Consequently, orthologs of Hsp30 may well be found in mammals, birds and reptiles, too, provided that these genes have not been silenced in these branches of the tree. Even earlier, but also later gene duplications may have given rise ato further, as yet undiscovered mammalian sHsps. Within a few years the human genome project will provide the answer. 3. To the roots of -crystallin Proteins can be considered as evolutionarily related when conspicuous sequence similarities can be detected over longer and contiguous stretches of residues. Such homologous proteins are accordingly grouped in families and superfamilies, with higher or lower than about 50% sequence identity, respectively. As mentioned already, members of the h-crystallin ­ sHsp superfamily are characterized by the presence of a homologous sequence of about 80 ­ 100 residues, the `h-crystallin domain'. It should be realized that not all `small heat shock proteins' belong to this superfamily. Such is the case with yeast Hsp12 [44,45] and Hsp9 [46], which lack even traces of the h-crystallin domain. To avoid any confusion, we further use in this paper the abbreviation h-Hsp for members of the h-crystallin ­ sHsp superfamily. Actually, the designation h-Hsp is also more appropriate when we consider that among all heat-shock proteins the `small' Hsps form the largest multimeric complexes, while monomer size ranges from a mere 12 kDa in Caenorhabditis elegans [47] to a respectable 43 kDa in Saccharomyces cere6isiae [48]. To trace new h-Hsp entries in the data bases, searches were performed using a profile based on an alignment of the h-crystallin domains of 85 previously analyzed members of the h-Hsp superfamily [13]. All major groups of organisms are now represented in the extended data set. Fig. 2 presents a selection of 40 diverse representatives of the superfamily. More closely related gene products are omitted, as well as clearly orthologous sequences in the same group of organisms. For

Eubacteria, we have included a rather broad sampling, because their h-Hsps are widely divergent, even in the same species, like in Bradyrhizobium. Archaebacteria are represented by Methanococcus. Hsp30 of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is the only known protist representative, and the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas the only one for lower plants. Numerous higher plant (angiosperm) h-Hsps are known [8,12]. In some plant species, as many as 40 different h-Hsps may be present, which can be divided into five families. Two families, indicated as classes I and II [8], localize to the cytosol, and are the most numerous because of repeated gene duplications. One family localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum, another to the chloroplast, and the fifth one to the mitochondria. All these h-Hsps are encoded by nuclear genes. The five families of angiosperm h-Hsps are represented in Fig. 2 by the pea, Pisum sati6um. The completely known genome of Saccharomyces cere6isiae contains two very diverse members of the h-Hsp superfamily, both included in Fig. 2. The other representative of the fungi is Neurospora. Invertebrate animals are represented by the duplicated h-crystallin domain present in the 40-kDa egg antigens of the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni [49,50]; two diverse h-Hsps from among the over 15 genes present in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans [47,51] and one from another nematode, Acanthocheilonema 6itae; one of the seven Drosophila melanogaster h-Hsps encoded by a gene cluster at locus 67B [52], and another Drosophila h-Hsp, Efl, encoded by a gene at locus 59F [53]; p26 of the crustacean Artemia franciscana, also representing a family of at least three genes [54]; and a 29-kDa h-Hsp from the urochordate Halocynthia roretzia. As for the vertebrates, the five paralogous human h-Hsps are again included in Fig. 2, as well as the two known fish (Poeciliopsis) h-Hsps [39] and one of the at least seven rather closely related Xenopus lae6is Hsp30 proteins [43]. The alignment in Fig. 2 only shows the conserved h-crystallin domains and the C-terminal extensions of the proteins. The N-terminal regions of the h-Hsps are excluded from the alignment, because they vary extremely in length and sequence. The shortest N-terminal region yet--just 24 residues--is found in C. elegans Hsp12.3 [47]; the longest--246 residues--in S. cere6isiae Hsp42p [48]. No sequence similarities can be detected that are present in the N-terminal regions of all or most members of the superfamily. Nevertheless, minor similarities, often containing some

157

phenylalanine and proline residues, can be noticed between quite distantly related h-Hsps (e.g. [37,51,54 ­ 56]. This indicates that evolutionary change has been much more pronounced in the N-terminal region than in the C-terminal domain. The fact that an intron precisely demarcates the N- and C-terminal regions at identical positions in the genes for h-crystallins and C. elegans h-Hsps [14,24] might suggest that the combination of the two domains is the result of exon shuffling early in evolution. However, h-Hsp genes in plants, yeast and several invertebrates are intronless, and other animal h-Hsp genes have introns at positions that have no relation with possible structural domains [13]. Recent evidence seems to favor the notion that present-day spliceosomal introns originated by random insertion events into previously intronless genes, rather than having escaped the random loss of common ancestral introns [57], but, the intron-early versus intron-late debate is still open. A satisfactory alignment of the extended set of h-crystallin domains can only be obtained at the expense of numerous gaps, which often must be introduced to accommodate the insertion of just a single residue in one or a few species (Fig. 2). The precise positioning of gaps in such a multiple alignment of distantly related proteins is often quite arbitrary, changing also with the number of included sequences. Nevertheless, various highly conserved regions can be recognized, even in an outlier like Bacillus CotM. Most characteristic for the superfamily as a whole are the motifs F-polarR-polar-aromatic-x-L-P at positions 75­82, and polar-G-V-L-polar-aliphatic-polar-aliphatic-P-basic at positions 98­108. A region of considerable length variation, and including many charged residues, extends from position 43 to 74. In this region, Neurospora Hsp30 even has a 66-residue insert (left out in the alignment). An ER duplet (50­ 51) is well conserved in this variable region, and present even twice (68­69) in most non-animal h-Hsps. Animal h-Hsps are characterized in this region by the presence of a consensus sequence KHEERxxDxxxxHG (positions 47­60). Interestingly, also at other positions there are clearly distinguishing features between animal and non-animal h-Hsps. Especially noteworthy are the triplet FxP (21 ­ 23) and the duplet LS (96­97) in animal h-Hsps, whereas the triplet LPG (positions 17­19), and the residues G72 and A94 are almost exclusively present in prokaryotes, Toxoplasma, plants and fungi. These observations indicate that

all animal h-Hsps originated from a common ancestral gene, of which no surviving representatives have as yet been found in other eukaryotes. Intriguingly, some of the typical `animal' residues (F21, P23, K47, L96) are also present in certain prokaryote h-Hsps. The demarcation between the C-terminal domain and extension is around position 108. This C-terminal extension is extremely variable in length and sequence. The extension is virtually absent--one or two residues--in a family of four C. elegans h-Hsps [47], and reaches a length of 49 residues in Artemia p26 and Drosophila Hsp27. Whenever the C-terminal extension is long enough, it almost invariably possesses a conserved RxIxI motif (positions 122­126). Also the secondary structure predictions for the alignment in Fig. 2 indicate the conservation of structural elements in the C-terminal domain and extension. The same eight i-pleated sheets as in the mammalian hHsps are predicted to be present when this extended sequence set is analysed. Residues 1­108 of the alignment in Fig. 2, corresponding to the h-crystallin domain, were used to construct a phylogenetic tree. A fully resolved, completely bifurcating tree is shown in Fig. 3, but it should be realized that with a data set of such relatively short and variable sequences most groupings are only marginally supported. Since branch lengths correspond with evolutionary distance, the lengths of internodes are indications of the support for particular groupings. It is cautious to consider short internodes as just suggestions for possible branching patterns. The tree is unrooted; it is reasonable, though, to place the root at the deepest divergence of the various prokaryote and eukaryote lineages. The most convincing feature in the tree is the strong evidence for a common origin of all the various animal h-Hsps, as could already be deduced from the characteristic sequence motifs in the alignment. Repeated gene duplications in the course of animal evolution are responsible for the various paralogous h-Hsps present in all animal species examined. The nematode h-Hsps appear to form the oldest offshoots. Interestingly, Fig. 3 suggests that the divergence of the genes for Hsp30 in Xenopus, fish and the tunicate Halocynthia from the lineage leading to the h-crystallin­ Hsp20­Hsp27 clade predated the divergence of the chordates from the insects and crustaceans. Human HspL27 appears to represent an even

158

older lineage. It thus may be expected that HspL27- and Hsp30-like proteins can be encountered in various invertebrate phyla. However, whole lineages of duplicated, paralogous h-Hsps must also have vanished again in certain animal taxa. Without such silencing of redundant duplicated genes, the number of paralogous h-Hsps would have increased exponentially in the course of evolution. The tree also indicates that the animal h-Hsps might derive from one of the multiple types of h-Hsp genes already present at the time of prokaryote ­ eukaryote divergence. This is again in agreement with the observation from the alignment that certain prokaryote h-Hsps, namely Bradyrhizobium a, Escherichia a, Buchnera and Legionella, retain some minor, but specific resemblances with the animal h-Hsps. Descendants of this particular gene should of course have been

present in the last common ancestor of animals, plants and fungi, but have not yet been encountered in those eukaryotes. h-Hsps from those other eukaryotes then should find their roots among other copies of the duplicated prokaryote h-Hsps. This might indeed be the case. The fungal h-Hsps may be closer to those of the prokaryotes Clostridium and Leuconostoc, while the h-Hsps of the protist Toxoplasma and all plants branched off earlier from the major lineage towards presentday prokaryote h-Hsps. The archaebacterial Methanococcus h-Hsp is nested within that latter lineage. The tree supports, as has been suggested earlier [55], the notion that the five types of angiosperm h-Hsps are more closely related to each other than to the h-Hsps of any other eukaryotes. It also supports the finding that the endoplasmic reticulum Hsp22 is most closely related to the class I cytosolic Hsp18 [10,55]. The h-Hsps from the alga Chlamydomonas and the protist Toxoplasma represent a gene lineage that seems closest to that leading to the higher plants. The tree in Fig. 3 also provides information about the extent to which present-day h-Hsps have diverged from a common ancestor. The longer the branches, the more changes have occurred. It thus appears that certain h-Hsps have sustained more changes than others in the same time course. This is, for instance, the case for human HspL27 as compared with human hB-crystallin, and for Ibp of the endosymbiont Buchnera compared with Ibp-a of E. coli. Such accelerations may either indicate the loss of functional constraints or the acquirement of new structural and functional properties. Conversely, it is generally held that sequences are more conserved when they have to maintain important structural or functional properties. It also can be seen in Fig. 3 that the duplication of the h-crystallin domain in the Schistosoma p40 gene must have occurred very early after its divergence from the other animal h-Hsps. Moreover, the C-terminal one of the duplicated domains has apparently been less constrained than the N-terminal one. 4. A multifunctional family Comparing the sequences and tracing the phylogeny of a protein family provides insight in the primordial structures and functions of those proteins. Looking then at the h-Hsps, we notice

Fig. 3. Phylogenetic tree based on the h-crystallin domains of the h-Hsps shown in Fig. 2 (positions 1­108). This unrooted tree was constructed according to the neighbor-joining method [84], using the program NEIGHBOR [85]. The input matrix was generated [86] using maximum likelihood distances obtained with the program PUZZLE [87]. Branch lengths are thus proportional to likelihood distances.

that-- structurally --a common feature is the tendency to occur as multisubunit water-soluble complexes. This ranges from 9 subunits in the 149-kDa oligomers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Hsp16.3 [58] and 12 subunits in pea h-Hsps [59] to 20­40 subunits in the 400­800 kDa complexes of animal h-Hsps [25,60,61]. The only exception yet to the oligomeric structure seems C. elegans Hsp12.6, which was found to be monomeric [47]. Many of the h-Hsp genes, from prokaryotes (e.g. in E. coli [62], Streptomyces [63] and Leuconostoc [64]) to higher eukaryotes (e.g. [12,21,32,43]), are constitutively expressed at low levels and become upregulated under stressful conditions, to provide protection, probably by interacting with other cellular proteins. Many other h-Hsp genes, again both prokaryote (e.g. in Buchnera [65], Bradyrhizobium [66] and Clostridium [67]) and eukaryote can not be induced by exogenous stresses. They are developmentally regulated, being expressed at specific stages and in particular cell types, and assumed to be involved in coping with the wear-and-tear of normal growth and development of the organism. The ancestral and core function of the superfamily thus seems clear: helping the cell to survive under the stress of life, whether transient or constitutive, endogenous or exogenous. In eukaryotes, these protective activities of the h-Hsps are exerted in most if not all cell compartments, including nucleus, plant mitochondria, chloroplasts and endoplasmic reticulum. Certain h-Hsps are clearly indispensible, like C. elegans SEC-1 [51] and Drosophila Efl [53], which are essential for normal embryonic development. The deletion of other h-Hsp genes has lesser or even undetectable adverse effects, like for yeast Hsp26 [7] and mouse h-crystallins [28,31]. The working mechanism of the stress-protective properties of the h-Hsps is still largely elusive, but is likely to be related to their in vitro chaperonelike activity. This capacity to stabilize unfolding proteins, first demonstrated for mammalian hcrystallin [6] and Hsp27 [16,68], is now documented for h-Hsps in organisms as diverse as M. tuberculosis [58], pea [59] and Artemia [61]. Therefore, the propensity to associate with denaturing proteins, thus delaying the formation of insoluble aggregates, must be a primordial property of the h-Hsps. The involvement of h-Hsps with stabilization and rearrangement of cytoskeletal structures in eukaryotes [15,32] must be derived from the ancestral chaperoning activity.

Like h-crystallin in the eye lens, also some other h-Hsps can reach very high levels in specific tissues or developmental stages. This has undoubtedly to do with the stabilizing, beneficial properties of heat-shock proteins under harsh or demanding conditions. An interesting means for achieving such high h-Hsp levels is observed in the bacterium Buchnera aphidicola, an intracellular symbiont in plant-lice [65]. It has a plasmid-encoded h-Hsp, resulting in overproduction of the protein. A clear example of the usefulness of abundant expression of an h-Hsp in eukaryotes is provided by the brine-shrimp Artemia, where p26 constitutes up to 15% of the non-yolk protein in the cysts [61]. These are encysted gastrulae in a dormant state, which are resistant to severe insults, including complete desiccation and anoxia, temperature extremes, k-irradiation and exposure to various organic solvents. Also the emerging embryo, while fully hydrated, remains resistant to anoxia as long as p26 is present. The abundant expression of h-Hsps has in certain prokaryotes been made to use for other purposes as well. In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the h-Hsp CotM is part of a cross-linked insoluble skeleton that surrounds the spores [56]. It serves as a matrix for the assembly of additional outer coat material, conferring structural stability. Also Hsp18 of Leuconostoc oenos is peripherally associated with the membrane [64]. The prominent presence of h-Hsps in parasitic prokaryotes, especially under hostile conditions in the host, explains their significance as immunodominant antigens, like in Mycobacterium species [69,70]. Hsp16.3 of M. tuberculosis is probably located as a major peripheral membrane protein on the outside of the cell wall [69], but, interestingly, has maintained its chaperoning capacities [58]. The tendency to associate with membranes may be a widespread feature of the superfamily, also being documented for mammalian h-crystallins [71]. h-Hsps acting as antigens are also found in parasitic eukaryotes, like in Schistosoma mansoni, where two p40 egg proteins are major antigens [49,50]. These egg antigens, with their duplicated h-crystallin domains, are soluble calcium-binding proteins [72]. Beside their primary chaperoning and structural roles, h-Hsps are likely to have additional, more subtle regulatory and signalling functions during development and under normal or stressful physiological conditions [15,32]. This is suggested by the distinct developmental regulation of the multi-

ple h-Hsps in many organisms, from prokaryotes to mammals, by the reversible phosphorylation, translocation and dissociation of various h-Hsps, and by their involvement in apoptosis [73,74]. 5. Relating evolution to structure and function of the -hsps What can these evolutionary comparisons tell us to better understand the key properties of hHsps? It is logical to ascribe the common features of most members of the superfamily, notably the tendency to form oligomeric complexes and the chaperone-like properties, to the conserved sequences in the C-terminal h-crystallin domain. The predicted secondary structure of this domain is indeed highly conserved, consisting of two hydrophobic motifs, enriched in i-pleated sheet structure, and separated by a hydrophilic, sometimes h-helical region, which is variable in length [13,47,54]. Yet, the C-terminal domain of hA-crystallin in itself tends to form dimers or tetramers and is devoid of chaperone activity [75]. Moreover, the very short Hsp12.6 of C. elegans, almost reduced to the very h-crystallin domain, appears to be monomeric, and also lacks chaperone activity [47]. This indicates that a variable N-terminal region and a hydrophilic C-terminal extension are essential, too, for oligomerization and chaperoning. The structural basis for the oligomeric and often dynamic structures of the h-Hsps remains elusive, especially because experimentally determined tertiary structures are still lacking. The evidence that both trimeric [59] and dimeric or tetrameric [25] building blocks are present in different h-Hsps, makes it even more difficult to propose a unifying principle for the elusive quaternary structure of the h-Hsps. The fact that animal h-Hsps have some distinguishing sequence features in their hcrystallin domains might suggest that they have certain structural --and hence functional--peculiarities, too. As for the chaperone-like activity, there is indeed considerable evidence for the involvement of the flexible C-terminal extension [25]. Truncation or immobilization of the C-terminus greatly reduces this capacity. The hydrophilic tail is likely to be important to keep complexes of chaperones and bound proteins in solution. The role of the remarkably conserved I×I i-sheet

motif in these extensions, which is separated from the C-terminal domain by a highly variable exposed region [76] remains to be determined. One also may wonder whether a causal relation exists between the relatively frequent presence of a C-terminal lysine in especially the animal hHsps and the fact that this lysine in hB-crystallin and Hsp27 is a substrate for transglutaminase, an enzyme that covalently crosslinks proteins [16]. Important roles have also been proposed for regions in the highly variable N-terminal domains of the h-Hsps. The more hydrophobic character of this domain in mammalian h-Hsps would favour multimerization and might be involved in capturing exposed hydrophobic regions of unfolding proteins (see Ref. [25]). As mentioned already, these properties are indeed jeopardized when this domain is reduced or deleted. In plants, the h-Hsps which localize to chloroplasts, mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum all have transit sequences in their N-terminal domains that are specific for each organelle [55]. The variable N-termini of the Drosophila h-Hsps may regulate interactions with membranes [77]. In Artemia p26 the N-terminus is enriched in glycine, arginine and phenylalanine, which possibly functions as an unusual nuclear localization signal [54]. In hB-crystallin and mammalian Hsp27, the phosphorylation sites, implicated in oligomerization and signalling, are located in the N-terminal domain [15,32,76]. It is a logical and attractive assumption that the variable N-terminus, in conjunction with the C-terminal tail, modulates the basic functions of the h-Hsp superfamily as preserved in the h-crystallin domain. Note added in proof The gene for a sixth mammalian small Hsp, named HSPB2, has recently been characterized in human and rat [88]. It is located head-to-head with the hB-crystallin gene, at less than 1 kb upstream. The gene is preferentially expressed in heart and striated muscle. A partial cDNA for this sHSP was earlier isolated from human eye muscle, as a possible autoantigen for thyroid associated ophthalmopathy [89]. Adding HSPB2 to the phylogenetic tree in Fig. 3, places it closer to Hsp27 and HspL20 than to the cluster of h-crystallins and Hsp20.
