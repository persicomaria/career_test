ABSTRACT: We have determined the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli ThiS-ThiF protein complex at 2.0 Å resolution. ThiS and ThiF are bacterial proteins involved in the synthesis of the thiazole moiety of thiamin. ThiF catalyzes the adenylation of the carboxy terminus of ThiS and the subsequent displacement of AMP catalyzed by ThiI-persulfide to give a ThiS-ThiI acyl disulfide. Disulfide interchange, involving Cys184 on ThiF, then generates the ThiS-ThiF acyl disulfide, which functions as the sulfur donor for thiazole formation. ThiS is a small 7.2 kDa protein that structurally resembles ubiquitin and the molybdopterin biosynthetic protein MoaD. ThiF is a 27 kDa protein with distinct sequence and structural similarity to the ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 and the molybdopterin biosynthetic protein MoeB. The ThiF-ThiS structure clarifies the mechanism of the sulfur transfer chemistry involved in thiazole biosynthesis.

Thiamin pyrophosphate (11, vitamin B1) is an important cofactor in all living systems. It is involved primarily in carbohydrate and branched chain amino acid metabolism, where it stabilizes acyl carbanion intermediates (1). Vitamin B1 is an essential nutrient in humans, and the thiamin deficiency diseases beriberi and Wernike-Korsakoff syndrome have been extensively studied (2, 3). The thiamin biosynthetic pathway in Escherichia coli is outlined in Scheme 1 (4, 5). The biosynthesis of thiazole 8 is complex and involves six proteins (ThiS, ThiF, ThiG, ThiH, ThiI, and IscS). IscS, an enzyme also involved in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, catalyzes the transfer of the cysteine sulfur to ThiI to give ThiI-persulfide 3 (6, 7). ThiF catalyzes the adenylation of ThiS, at its carboxy terminus, to give 2 and the subsequent displacement of AMP by the ThiI-persulfide to give 4. Disulfide interchange, involving Cys184 on ThiF, generates the mixed acyl disulfide 5, which functions as the sulfur donor for thiazole formation (6, 8). Thiazole formation in E. coli has been reconstituted, at trace levels, but the mechanistic details are not yet well understood (9). The corresponding thiazole biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis (Scheme 2) involves five proteins (ThiS, ThiF, ThiG, ThiO, and IscS) and differs in the detailed mechanism of the redox and sulfur transfer chemistry from the E. coli pathway (10).

In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, thiazole 8 displaces the pyrophosphate of pyrimidine 9 to form thiamin phosphate, and a final phosphorylation generates thiamin pyrophosphate 11, the biologically active form of the cofactor (11, 12). ThiS is a 7.2 kDa protein (66 amino acids) that is structurally similar to ubiquitin and MoaD (13). All three proteins are small (<100 amino acids) and have a low degree of sequence similarity except for a carboxy-terminal GlyGly pair. ThiF is a 27 kDa protein (251 amino acids) with sequence and structural similarity to Ubl1 activating enzymes, and to the molybdopterin biosynthetic protein MoeB (1417). The molybdopterin biosynthetic proteins MoeB and MoaD have functions similar to those of the ThiF-ThiS complex. MoeB catalyzes the ATP-dependent formation of MoaD-thiocarboxylate, which functions as the sulfur source for molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. The relationship between the ThiF-ThiS complex and the ubiquitinating system is less direct and involves thioester rather than acyl disulfide formation. In this system, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 catalyzes the formation of the acyl adenylate of ubiquitin, which then reacts with a cysteine on E1 to form a thioester. This thioester functions as the ubiquitin donor, ultimately tagging proteins for degradation in the proteasome (18, 19). While no prokaryotic genome has been found to encode the ubiquitinating enzymes, these similarities suggest that the ubiquitin-E1, ThiS-ThiF, and MoaD-MoeB systems have evolved from a common ancestor. The structural enzymology of the metabolism of thiazole 8 is now at an advanced stage, and representative examples

of all of the enzymes involved have been structurally characterized. These enzymes include thiaminase I (20) and thiaminase II (21), both of which catalyze the cleavage of the thiazole from thiamin, thiazole kinase (22), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of the thiazole alcohol, thiamin phosphate synthase (23), which catalyzes the attachment of the thiazole to the pyrimidine and ThiO (24), ThiF (25), ThiS (13), and ThiSG (26), which are all involved in thiazole assembly. Here we describe the crystal structure of the protein complex between ThiS and ThiF from E. coli at 2.0 Å resolution. This structure clarifies the mechanism of the sulfur transfer chemistry involved in thiazole biosynthesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Production. Construction of the thiFS-containing pCLK1405 plasmid was described previously (6). For protein

production, the pCLK1405 plasmid was transformed into E. coli overexpression strain BL834(DE3) (Novagen). A starter culture was prepared by inoculating a single colony into 5 mL of LB medium containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin and shaking overnight at 200 rpm and 37 °C. The starter culture was inoculated into 1 L of LB medium containing 100 µg/ mL ampicillin. This culture was grown at 37 °C and 200 rpm to a cell density corresponding to an OD600 of 0.6 and induced with 300 µM isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside. After being induced for 3 h, the cells were harvested and centrifuged at 4000g for 5 min. All subsequent purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were resuspended in 50 mL of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8) (buffer A) and lysed using sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 23000g for 30 min, and ammonium sulfate was added to bring its concentration in the supernatant to 50%. The resulting precipitate was

Protein purification was performed on an AKTA explorer FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). The dialyzate was applied to a 5 mL Hi-Trap QFF column (Amersham Biosciences), washed with buffer A for 30 min, and eluted with buffer A containing 250 mM NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by SDSPAGE and pooled. Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 200 high load 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min using buffer A. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and concentrated to 20 mg/mL using an Amicon Ultra 15 concentrator (Millipore) with a 5 kDa molecular mass cutoff. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (27). The sample was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Crystallization of the ThiS-ThiF Complex. The ThiSThiF complex was crystallized using the hanging drop method with each drop containing 1.2 µL of protein solution (8 mg/mL ThiF-ThiS complex in buffer A) and 1.2 µL of well solution [7-8% polyethylene glycol 400, 35 mM calcium chloride, and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0-7.3)]. Crystals appeared sporadically within 3 days to 2 weeks and grew to a maximum size of 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm. Preliminary X-ray analysis showed that the crystals belong to orthorhombic space group P212121 with the following unit cell dimensions: a ) 49.51 Å, b ) 111.17 Å, and c ) 114.15 Å. The Matthews coefficient, assuming two monomers of ThiF and two monomers of ThiS per asymmetric unit, is 2.3 Å3/Da. This corresponds to 47% solvent. For cryoprotection, the crystals were transferred into solutions containing an additional 25% glycerol, frozen directly in the cryostream, and stored under liquid nitrogen for later use. X-ray Data Collection and Processing. In-house data were collected using a Rigaku RTP 300 RC copper rotating anode X-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA, equipped with a Rigaku RAXIS IV++ image plate detector. Integration and scaling of diffraction intensities were performed using CRYSTAL CLEAR (Rigaku/Molecular Structure Corp.). Two synchrotron data sets were collected. First, data were collected at Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) station F2 at a wavelength of 1.49 Å to a resolution of 2.4 Å. This wavelength was chosen to exploit the anomalous signal for heteroatom identification. Station F2 was equipped with a Quantum 210 X-ray detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.). Data were collected over 110° using 50 s for each 0.5° oscillation with a crystal to detector distance of 150 mm. The second data set was collected, using the identical crystal, at Northeastern Collaborative Access Team (NE-CAT) beamline 8-BM at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), at a wavelength of 0.98 Å to a resolution of 2.0 Å. Beamline 8-BM was equipped with an ADSC Quantum 315 X-ray detector. Data were collected over 158.5° using 30 s for each 0.5° oscillation with a crystal to detector distance of 310 mm. The data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (28). Data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structure Determination. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using MOLREP (29). MoeB (chain A) from the MoeB-MoaD complex (15) (PDB entry 1JW9) was used as a search model.

were deleted from the model. In-house data were used to a resolution of 3 Å. Two monomers of ThiF were found. The first gave a correlation coefficient of 0.204 and an R-factor of 0.572, while the second gave a correlation coefficient of 0.300 and an R-factor of 0.542. A A-weighted 2Fo - Fc map clearly showed density for two ThiS molecules. B. subtilis ThiS (PDB entry 1TYG) was truncated at the C-terminus after residue Val63. Two of these ThiS models were manually fitted into this electron density using the MoeB-MoaD complex as a guide. Model Building and Structure Refinement. All model building was performed using O (30). E. coli ThiF side chains were inserted into the MoeB molecular replacement model, and the E. coli ThiS side chains were inserted into the ThiS model, after which all side chains were manually adjusted. The structure was refined against data between 25 and 2.0 Å resolution using CNS (31). The refinement procedure involved rigid body refinement followed by successive rounds of simulated annealing, individual temperature factor refinement and model rebuilding. Early refinement was aided by the use of noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. Water molecules were added to the model in the final stages of the refinement if the Fo - Fc difference electron density peaks were g3. Anomalous and dispersive difference electron maps were calculated in CNS using the two synchrotron data sets. These maps were used to aid in the identification of metal ions. Structural analysis was carried out using PROCHECK (32) for geometric analysis, MOLSCRIPT (33) and RASTER3D (34) for structure depiction, and DALI (35) for identification of structural homologues. The proteinprotein interfaces were analyzed using SPOCK (36), and the protein interaction server (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/ bsm/PP/server/index.html). The final refinement statistics are given in Table 2. RESULTS The Final Model. The final crystallographic R-factor is 17.4%, and Rfree is 22.9%. The asymmetric unit contains one ThiF dimer (chains A and C) and two molecules of ThiS (chains B and D). The model also contains 390 water molecules, two zinc ions, two calcium ions, and two sodium ions. Electron density was missing for Asp176 to Thr186 and the six C-terminal residues of chain A, Met1 of chain B, and Pro181-Arg185 and the six C-terminal residues of chain C. These residues were omitted from the final model. Twenty-seven residues were refined with multiple conformations.

Description of the Structure. ThiF is an R/ protein consisting of an eight-stranded mixed -sheet with the topology 3v 2v 1v 4v 5v 6V 7v 8V, which is flanked by six R-helices and two 310-helices (5 and 6) on one side and three R-helices on the other side (Figure 1A). The root-meansquare deviation (rmsd) for the two monomers of ThiF in the asymmetric unit is 0.27 Å. Comparison of ThiF to known structures in the Protein Data Bank using DALI revealed several structural relatives. MoeB (PDB entry 1JW9) gave the best fit based on the DALI Z score, with an rmsd of 1.3 Å for 235 (240 total) aligned CR positions. This is consistent with the high level of sequence identity (46%) between MoeB and ThiF. The second best fit corresponded to the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) activating enzyme Sae1 (PDB entry 1Y8Q, chain A) from the Sae1-Sae2 complex structure (37), with an rmsd of 2.0 Å for 219 (313 total) aligned CR positions. The third best fit corresponded to the APPBP1 monomer (PDB entry 1NGV, chain A) from

the NEDD8 activating enzyme APPBP1-UBA3 (38), with an rmsd of 1.8 Å for 218 (529 total) aligned CR positions (Figure 2). Eukaryotic ThiF homologues are generally larger than ThiF and contain additional domains. Furthermore, the level of sequence identity in the region of structural similarity is only 20%. In contrast to homodimeric ThiF, the Sae1Sae2 and APPBP1-UBA3 species are heterodimers that show structural similarity between the two monomers. As a result, the Sae1 partner, Sae2 (PDB entry 1Y8Q, chain B), and the APPBP1 partner, UBA3 (PDB entry 1NGV, chain B), are the next two structures in the DALI search, with rmsd's and sequence identity levels comparable to those of their partners. ThiF contains a Zn-sulfur center in which zinc is tetrahedrally coordinated by the sulfur atoms of cysteine residues Cys169, Cys172, Cys240, and Cys243. The presence of zinc is consistent with anomalous and dispersive difference maps calculated using the two synchrotron data sets (Table 1). Additional features in the difference electron density maps (calculated between the two synchrotron data sets) indicated radiation damage, especially for the carboxylate groups of Asp124 and Asp59 and the methylthio group of Met159. Interestingly, the radiation damage occurred in both ThiF chains at the same locations and to similar extents as judged by the peak heights in the difference map. ThiS is an R/ protein adopting a ubiquitin-like fold. A five-stranded mixed -sheet with the topology 2v 1V 5V 4v 3V is flanked on one side by an R-helix and a 310-helix (Figure 1B). The rmsd for the CR positions between the two ThiS molecules in the asymmetric unit is 0.9 Å. Difference dissected distance matrices (39) indicated that the C-terminus is the most rigid part of the molecule in this structure. Neglecting residues 1-28 and 41-52 from the calculation gives an rmsd of 0.25 Å. In addition, the temperature factors are lowest in the C-terminal region and highest for the 310helix and the two loops containing residues 10-18 and residues 46-56. These two loops run in parallel, and their structural differences are directionally correlated perpendicular to that direction. Comparison to the ThiS solution structure (13) (PDB entry 1F0Z) gives an rmsd of 2.1 Å. Neglecting residues 59-66, which are poorly defined in the NMR structure, yields an rmsd of 1.2 Å. Comparing E. coli ThiS to the ThiS from the B. subtilis ThiS-ThiG complex (26) (PDB entry 1TYG), which are 22% identical in sequence, gives an rmsd of 1.8 Å for 64 of 66 CR positions. The structure of MoaD (17) (PDB entry 1FMA) superimposes with an rmsd of 2.4 Å for 59 of 81 aligned CR positions. The sequence of MoaD is 24% identical with that of ThiS. ThiS also is structurally

X-ray Structure of the ThiS-ThiF Complex

Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2006 15 bonds between ThiS and ThiF, seven bridging waters, and a salt bridge between Asp7 of ThiS and Arg230 of ThiF. The ThiS-ThiF interface buries 9% of the total accessible surface area of ThiF and 24% of the surface area for ThiS. ThiF ActiVe Site. The structure of ThiF alone and with bound ATP was recently determined (25), and this allowed us to model the ThiF-ThiS-ATP complex (Figure 5). In this model, each ThiSF tetramer contains two active sites and each active site is composed of residues from both ThiF monomers. The ThiS C-terminus can be found at the bottom of the active site, and close to the ATP R-phosphate. The active site is lined with residues from five conserved sequence stretches. The residues beneath the adenosine base and the ribose are composed of a glycine rich nucleotidebinding motif reaching from residue Leu32 to Gly40. The nucleotide-binding loop can be found between 1 and R3, and it interacts with the ATP in the active site. Asp59 and Asp61 make up a conserved DXD motif located on the loop between 2 and 310-helix 5, and are within hydrogen bonding distance of the ribose hydroxyl groups. The 310-helix 5 is highly conserved in all E1's and maintains several interactions with the ATP - and -phosphate groups. This helix is believed to stabilize the outgoing pyrophosphate group after nucleophilic attack of the ThiS C-terminal carboxylate on ATP's R-phosphate. Asp127, located in the loop between 4 and R9, has been predicted to bind a Mg2+ ion (15), which would activate the R-phosphate for nucleophilic attack. An equivalent Mg2+ ion was observed in the structure of the Sae1-Sae2 complex (37). Arg132 on R9 is responsible for the positioning of the ThiS C-terminal Gly-Gly motif. Arg132 maintains a hydrogen bond to Ala64 of ThiS, thus leaving some flexibility in the C-terminus for attacking ATP. Arg11 from the other ThiF monomer in the dimer makes a salt bridge to the R-phosphate of ATP. The disordered loop region between Pro181 and Arg185, called the "crossover" loop, contains the highly conserved Cys184 involved in the formation of ThiF-ThiS acyl disulfide 5. In the ThiF-ATP structure, the thiol group of this cysteine is nearly 20 Å from the R-phosphate of ATP, suggesting that a large conformational change in this region of the protein is required for the formation of acyl disulfide 5. ThiF is a zinc-containing protein. The structure demonstrates that the zinc ion is more then 20 Å from the active site and most likely has a structural rather than a catalytic role (25).

similar to ubiquitin (40) (PDB entry 1UBI). Superposition gives an rmsd of 2.6 Å for 60 of 79 aligned CR positions (Figure 3). The level of sequence identity between ThiS and ubiquitin is 13%. Quaternary Structure. The ThiS-ThiF complex is a heterotetramer consisting of a dimer of heterodimers. The heterotetramer displays 2-fold symmetry and has approximate dimensions of 55 Å × 55 Å × 65 Å (Figure 4). ThiF forms a central globular dimer, which is complexed with two ThiS molecules. There are no contacts between the two ThiS molecules, resulting in a large cleft with a minimum ThiSThiS distance of 20 Å. Each ThiS binds a deep crevice of one ThiF with its C-terminus; ThiF chain A binds to ThiS chain B, and ThiF chain C binds to ThiS chain D. The main interactions between the two ThiF molecules are hydrophobic, in which 68% of the atoms are nonpolar. Surface atoms belong mainly to residues located on helices, namely, R2, R4, 310-helix 5, R7, and R11. There are 14 hydrogen bonds involved in the ThiF-ThiF interface, and 22 bridging waters can be found between chains A and C. The ThiF dimer interface buries 22% of the total accessible surface area of ThiF. The interface between ThiF and ThiS is also mostly hydrophobic with 60% of the atoms involved in the ThiSThiF interface being nonpolar. The ThiF surface utilizes the turn preceding R4, the stretch before R9, Arg70, the four strands from 5 to 8, and R10 from the antiparallel part of the central -sheet to form the protein-protein interface, while the ThiS surface utilizes 3, 4, Asp7, Leu58, and the C-terminus from Phe60 to Gly66. There are 14 hydrogen

DISCUSSION Comparison of the ThiF-ThiS Complex to ThiF Alone. The recently published structure of ThiF alone (25) superimposes with an rmsd of 0.69 Å to the ThiF of the ThiFThiS complex described here. The largest differences can be found between the C- and N-terminal residues as well as for the last ordered residues of the crossover loop. The CR positions of Thr186 from the two structures differ by more then 5 Å. The predicted ThiS-ThiF model is consistent with this study with respect to the relative orientations of ThiS and ThiF. A closer examination of the crossover loop revealed that the aromatic side chain of Trp174 adopts a different orientation in the complex to avoid a close contact with Gly31 from ThiS, while the side chain of Asp176 of ThiF is oriented closer to ThiS to accept a hydrogen bond from the amide nitrogen of Gly31 of ThiS. These structural differences show that the crossover loop adopts a different conformation in the complex compared to that with ThiF alone. Comparison of the ThiS-ThiF Complex to the ThiS-ThiG Complex. ThiS forms complexes with both ThiF and ThiG, and the structures of the two complexes can be used to compare the two ThiS binding modes. Because the ThiSThiF structure is from E. coli and the ThiS-ThiG structure is from B. subtilis (26), a B. subtilis ThiS-ThiF structure was created by homology modeling to allow a more direct comparison. The ThiS-ThiG X-ray structure was superimposed onto the ThiS-ThiF homology model using the two ThiS molecules as the reference, and the binding surfaces

were calculated. The surface areas utilized by ThiS to bind ThiF or ThiG are similar in size and overlap significantly, with roughly 70% of the ThiS binding surface common to both complexes. The hydrophobic contents of the two interfaces are roughly the same. Most of the hydrophobic interactions are contributed by the C-terminus of ThiS and hydrophobic residues surrounding the base of the C-terminal extension of ThiS. In both the ThiS-ThiG and ThiS-ThiF complexes, an arginine residue (Arg230 in ThiF and Arg183 in ThiG) takes roughly the same position relative to ThiS. In the ThiS-ThiF complex, the arginine forms a salt bridge with Asp7 of ThiS, and in the ThiS-ThiG complex, the arginine forms a salt bridge with Glu35 of ThiS. The surface areas unique to either ThiF or ThiG lie on opposite sides of ThiS (Figure 6). In the region of ThiS utilized by only ThiG, a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues Leu4, Asn5, Lys7, Val9, and Tyr25 accepts Ile149 and Phe150 from ThiG. These residues are part of an extended 2 and R2 loop of the ThiG ( R)8 barrel. In the region of ThiS utilized by only ThiF, Glu44 of ThiS forms two hydrogen bonds with backbone amide groups of positions 2 and 3 of a reverse turn located just before the C-terminus of ThiF. In the homology model, aspartic acid (position 2) and alanine (position 3) occupy the corners of the turn, while in the X-ray structure of the ThiF-ThiS complex, these residues correspond to Ser238 and Gly239, respectively. In the X-ray structure, the reverse turn is type I, while in the homology model, the turn adopts a significantly different conformation. However, Glu44 is conserved

between E. coli ThiS and B. subtilis ThiS, suggesting that this interaction may also be conserved. In considering the homology model, it is important to note that B. subtilis ThiF, as well as ThiF from several related bacteria, contains an additional C-terminal domain of unknown structure and function. This roughly 90-amino acid domain has a high degree of sequence similarity within these bacterial systems. Interestingly, a homologous domain is also present in MoeB from B. subtilis, but not MoeB from E. coli. No significant sequence similarity has been detected between the extra C-terminal domains of ThiF or MoeB, and the C-terminal domains from related systems such as E1 or Ubl activating enzymes. Mechanistic Implications. Our current understanding of the mechanism of thiazole formation is outlined in Scheme 2. Two pathways have been identified in bacteria. In the first pathway, which is found in E. coli, ThiF catalyzes the adenylation of ThiS on its carboxy terminus. The resulting acyl adenylate 2 reacts with the persulfide of ThiI 3 to form 4. Disulfide interchange with the thiol of Cys184 of ThiF gives ThiF-ThiS acyl disulfide 5, which has been detected as an intermediate (6). The subsequent steps involved in the conversion of 5 to thiazole 8 are still poorly understood (9). One possibility for the next step in the reaction sequence is that enamine 12, formed between deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate 6 and ThiG, reacts with 5 to form 13 (10). We have carried out modeling studies to determine if the reactions involved in the conversion of 1 to 13 are consistent with the structure of the ThiF-ThiS complex. Using our ThiF-ThiS structure and the previously published ThiFATP structure, we generated a model for the acyl adenylate of ThiS complexed to ThiF 2 (Figure 7). This model suggests that for the conversion of 2 to 4, one of the phosphate oxygens of the acyl adenylate is positioned to deprotonate the persulfide 3 and the carbonyl group of the acyl adenylate

is activated by hydrogen bonding to the amide hydrogens of Gly38 and Leu39 and a water molecule (Figure 8). We then modeled the formation of 4 by positioning a cysteine persulfide on the reaction trajectory for nucleophilic addition to the acyl adenylate of 2 (Figure 8). This reaction occurs on an open face of ThiF that should be accessible to ThiI persulfide 3. The ThiF-ThiS acyl disulfide 5 was generated by replacement of the ThiI cysteine with Cys184 of ThiF. This cysteine is nearly 20 Å from the R-phosphate of ATP in the ThiF-ATP structure but is on a disordered loop in our ThiF-ThiS structure. However, if we model the missing amino acids, it is not unreasonable that Cys184 could carry out a disulfide interchange with the acyl disulfide in 4. In the second pathway for thiazole formation, which is found in B. subtilis, ThiF also catalyzes the adenylation of ThiS on its carboxy terminus. The resulting acyl adenylate 2 reacts with the persulfide of IscS (not ThiI) to form an analogue of 4. While we have been unable to detect a ThiFThiS acyl disulfide in this system, it is likely that 5 is formed because Cys184 is a conserved residue in ThiF for both pathways. This suggests that the acyl disulfide is rapidly reduced to thiocarboxylate 14, which has been demonstrated to function as the sulfur source for thiazole formation in B. subtilis (10, 41). All ThiF proteins associated with this second pathway have an additional carboxy-terminal domain that contains a conserved cysteine (Cys261 for B. subtilis ThiF). This cysteine may cleave the acyl disulfide of 5 by a disulfide interchange. ThiS-thiocarboxylate 14 then adds to 15 to give 16, which undergoes a sequence of elimination and/or dehydration reactions followed by reaction with the glycine imine 17 to give thiazole 8 (10, 26). The different redox chemistry of thiazole formation in E. coli and B. subtilis probably reflects the different oxygen requirements of the two microorganisms. E. coli can grow readily in the presence

18 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 1, 2006 and absence of oxygen and therefore must be able to carry out the two-electron oxidation required for thiazole biosynthesis by an oxygen-independent pathway (i.e., thioldisulfide chemistry). In contrast, B. subtilis grows very poorly in the absence of oxygen and during its normal aerobic growth uses oxygen directly to mediate the two-electron oxidation required for thiazole formation by oxidizing glycine to its imine 17, using a flavoenzyme (24).
