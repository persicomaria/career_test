The peroxisome proliferator activated receptors PPARR, PPAR, and PPAR are ligand-activated transcription factors that play a key role in lipid homeostasis. The fibrates raise circulating levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower levels of triglycerides in part through their activity as PPARR agonists; however, the low potency and restricted selectivity of the fibrates may limit their efficacy, and it would be desirable to develop more potent and selective PPARR agonists. Modification of the selective PPAR agonist 1 (GW501516) so as to incorporate the 2-aryl-2-methylpropionic acid group of the fibrates led to a marked shift in potency and selectivity toward PPARR agonism. Optimization of the series gave 25a, which shows EC50 ) 4 nM on PPARR and at least 500-fold selectivity versus PPAR and PPAR. Compound 25a (GW590735) has been progressed to clinical trials for the treatment of diseases of lipid imbalance.
Introduction Elevated circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) constitutes a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, and there exists a wealth of clinical data supporting the use of the LDLc-lowering statins in an increasingly wide range of patients.1 More recently, the roles of both low circulating levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) and high circulating levels of triglycerides (TG) as cardiovascular disease risk factors have come into focus, and there is a growing level of confidence in the potential of drugs that lower TG or raise HDLc to play an important part in future cardiovascular drug therapy.2 The principal agents in current use for raising HDLc and lowering TG are the fibrates and nicotinic acid. The fibrates give increases of up to 20% in HDLc and decreases in TG of up to 40%;2,3 nicotinic acid shows similar efficacy on HDLc with perhaps a slightly less pronounced effect on TG. It would be highly desirable to discover drugs that exert greater effects on HDLc and TG levels. While the molecular target of nicotinic acid has only recently been identified,4 the fibrates have been known for several years

to act as agonists at the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARR).5,6 The PPARs comprise a family of ligand-activated transcription factors that play a key role in lipid homeostasis. There are three members of the family: PPARR, PPAR (or ), and PPAR.7 PPARR is highly expressed in the liver, heart, and muscle and includes a range of fatty acids among its natural ligands. In man, activation of PPARR results in increased clearance of TG-rich very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) via a reduction in plasma levels of ApoCIII8 and in upregulation of ApoA1, the principal lipoprotein component of HDL.9 As a consequence, the fibrates lower TG and raise HDLc levels. The fibrates are only weakly potent PPARR agonists,10 as shown in Table 1. It has been proposed that more potent and subtype-selective PPARR activators might offer enhanced specificity and reduced side effects compared with that of existing fibrates,11 and several groups have reported the

discovery of potent PPARR agonists and their effects in animal models of dyslipidemia.12 We describe below how, starting from the recently published13 selective PPAR agonist 1 (GW501516) which showed weak potency on PPARR, we have first incorporated the classical fibrate "head group" to improve selectivity for PPARR and subsequently optimized potency and selectivity. We have thus developed a new series of highly potent and selective PPARR agonists, one of which, 25a, is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of dyslipidemia (Scheme 1). Chemistry Compound 10 was prepared as shown in Scheme 2. Condensation of 4-trifluoromethylthiobenzamide 2a with ethyl-2chloroacetoacetate gave the thiazole 3a, which was reduced with

LiAlH4 and oxidized with PCC to give the aldehyde 5. Compound 7 was prepared in two steps from ethyl 2-methylphenoxyacetate via reaction with formaldehyde and HCl to give 6 followed by substitution with triphenylphosphine to give 7. Wittig condensation of 5 with 7 gave the alkene 8, which was hydrogenated over 10% Pd on carbon to give 9. Hydrolysis using NaOH in dioxane furnished compound 10. Compound 14 was synthesized according to the procedure depicted in Scheme 3. Wittig condensation of 5 with 4-methoxybenzyltriphenylphosphonium chloride gave 11, which was hydrogenated over 10% Pd on carbon to give 12. Demethylation using boron tribromide gave 13, and coupling with 2-trichloromethyl-2-propanol and hydrolysis afforded 14. Alkylation of 4-nitrophenol followed by hydrogenolysis gave 16, which was coupled with the acid 17a, prepared by hydrolysis

Scheme 6a

The reversed amide 34 was prepared as shown in Scheme 9. Bromination of 4 using PBr3 gave 28. Substitution by potassium phthalimide gave 29, which was cleaved by hydrazine to give the amine 30. Compound 30 was coupled with 32, in turn prepared by alkylation of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde followed by oxidation using sodium chlorite and sodium hydrogen phosphate, giving 33, which was then hydrolyzed to give 34. The homologated amide 37 was synthesized via HOBT coupling of 17a with 4-hydroxyphenethylamine followed by alkylation and hydrolysis, as shown in Scheme 10. Compound 25k was prepared by hydrogenolysis of 24e followed by hydrolysis (Scheme 11). The 4-methanesulfonyloxy thiazole carboxylic ester 3l was prepared from 4-hydroxythiobenzamide 2k using the procedure described above, followed by mesylation using methane sulfonyl chloride and triethylamine. LiOH mediated hydrolysis gave the carboxylic acid 17k, which was alkylated to give ester 24l. Hydrolysis under mild conditions (1 equiv of LiOH, rt) of 24l gave product 25l, whereas more vigorous hydrolysis of 24l (NaOH, THF/EtOH, 70°) gave the phenol 25m (Scheme 12). The regioisomeric thiazole 41 was prepared in a similar manner to 25a via the carboxylic acid 39, obtained from condensation of 2a in refluxing ethanol with the intermediate obtained from the reaction of 2-ketobutyric acid with bromine to give 38, followed by hydrolysis. Coupling of 39 with 21 followed by standard hydrolysis gave 41, as depicted in Scheme 13. The trifluoromethyl-substituted thiazole 45 was prepared using a similar route to that used for 25a, substituting ethyl-2chloro-4,4,4-trifluoroacetate for the methyl analogue (Scheme 14).

of ester 3a, to give 18. Hydrolysis using NaOH in EtOH gave 19, as shown in Scheme 4. Compound 23 was prepared from 4-cyanophenol via alkylation and hydrogenation to give 21, which was reacted with aldehyde 5 under reductive amination conditions. The standard hydrolysis gave 23 (Scheme 5). Thiazole carboxylic acids 17b-j were prepared in the same manner as 17a, as indicated in Scheme 6. The acids 17a-j were then elaborated to the amides 25a-j via coupling using either HOBT/EDC/Et3N or SOCl2, followed by hydrolysis (Scheme 7). N-Methylamide 27 was obtained by methylation of 24a using NaH and methyl iodide followed by hydrolysis, as shown in Scheme 8.

The recently published 1 is a potent agonist at PPAR with around 1000-fold selectivity with respect to PPARR, as measured using cell-based transient-transfection assays14 (Table 2). Replacement of the thiomethylene chain of 1 by ethylene gave 10, which showed equally low potency against PPARR. PPAR potency was somewhat decreased (EC50 ) 4 nM) relative to 1, while PPAR activity remained very weak. Encouragingly however, replacement of the o-methyl phenoxyacetate group by the classical "fibrate head group" shared by all of the drugs shown in Table 1 gave 14, which regained potency against PPARR (EC50 ) 210 nM). We further explored the effect of modifying the chain linking the head group to the biaryl unit (Table 3). Replacement of the ethylene of 14 by an amide link gave 19, which showed almost complete loss of activity. However, increasing the length of the linking chain proved beneficial for PPARR potency.

methyleneaminomethylene derivative 23 gained 3-fold in potency, and the amide 25a showed a 50-fold increase in potency. N-Methylation (27) of the amide 25a was detrimental to PPARR potency, and the inverse amide 34 and the chain-extended amide 37 were also less potent. Replacement of the terminal trifluoromethyl substituent by a range of groups showed that substitution in this position was largely well tolerated and that potency correlated well with the lipophilicity of the substituent (Table 4). Thus the tert-butyl, trifluoromethyl, and trifluoromethoxy groups gave the highest potency, while fluoro, hydrogen, and amino substituents gave a progressive decrease in potency. All compounds demonstrated considerable selectivity for PPARR. The m-trifluoromethyl analogue 25i was equipotent with 25a versus PPARR, whereas the o-trifluoromethyl analogue 25j lost both PPARR potency and selectivity versus PPAR. The p-hydroxy 25m and p-methanesulfonyloxy 25l substituted compounds were inactive. We next investigated the effect of modifying the central heterocycle fragment (Table 5). The thiazole regioisomer 41 showed a 500-fold decrease in PPARR potency compared with 25a, whereas PPAR potency increased. The trifluoromethyl analogue 45 showed similar PPARR agonist potency to that of 25a but was less selective versus PPAR. Binding Mode of 25a in the PPARR Ligand Binding Domain. To determine with precision the binding mode of this new series of ligands, 25a was cocrystallized with PPARR. As

shown in Figure 1, 25a fits well into the PPARR binding site. The carboxylate moiety of the head group forms four hydrogen bonds with Ser-280, Tyr-314, Tyr-464, and His-440, as expected from the previous PPARR X-ray crystal structures of GW40954415 and AZ242.16 The gem-dimethyl substituents are directed into a lipophilic pocket bounded by Phe-273, Gln-277, Val-444, and Leu-456, a region at the top end of the so-called "benzophenone" pocket.17 These residues are conserved in PPAR and PPAR except for Val-444, which is leucine in PPAR and methionine in PPAR. This side chain is smallest and most able to accommodate the fibrate headgroup in PPARR and is largest and least able to accommodate the fibrate headgroup, in PPAR.14,18 This might explain why 14 gains potency versus PPARR and PPAR while maintaining a similar level of PPAR potency compared with 10. The amide group of 25a adopts a trans-conformation in which the carbonyl oxygen is directed toward Thr-279 and nearby water molecules. Although the carbonyl oxygen of 25a lies near Thr-279, the threonine side chain appears to adopt a conformation that turns its hydroxyl group away from the carbonyl oxygen. Instead of hydrogen bonding with this threonine, the carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bonds indirectly with Ser-280 and Thr-283 via two water molecules (Figure 2a). Thr-279 is hydrogen bonded to the backbone NH of Ala-333 via a third water molecule and oriented toward the sulfur of the thiazole in a manner likely to give a favorable interaction, even though sulfur does not form strong hydrogen bonds. The amide NH is positioned close to the methyl group of the thiazole and surrounded by three sulfur-containing amino acids, Cys-276, Met-355, and Met-330, with the sulfur atoms directed toward the NH proton at distances of 4.38 Å, 2.92 Å, and 3.33 Å, respectively (Figure 2b). This relatively polar environment stabilizes the partial positive charge of the NH, thereby favoring the observed conformation of 25a. Overall, the linking amide group of 25a appears to be well stabilized by the protein environment with the carbonyl surrounded by a very strong hydrogen bond network and the NH by a triad of polar atoms. This remarkable environment might explain the potency and selectivity of the amide linker compound in the PPARR pocket, which is more lipophilic and less solvent-exposed than the corresponding pockets of either PPAR or PPAR.15 The precise binding network around the amide linker might also account for the observation that any modification resulted in a decrease in PPARR potency. N-Methylation in 27 is not well tolerated due to the proximity of the sulfur atoms, and the reverse amide of 34 binds less favorably because its carbonyl

oxygen is probably not hydrogen bonded and is instead surrounded by three lipophilic amino acids. The nitrogen atom of the thiazole ring is not involved in any discernible interaction with the binding site, whereas the methyl

group fits well into a pocket that is connected with the bottom end of the benzophenone pocket. This pocket is bounded by Cys-276, Met-330, Leu-344, and Met-355 residues, which are conserved in PPAR and PPAR with the exception of Met330, which is valine in PPAR and leucine in PPAR, and Met355, which is isoleucine in PPAR. The smaller valine sidechain in PPAR could accommodate slightly larger substituents at this position on the thiazole, while the branched isoleucine in PPAR might crowd larger substituents. In accordance with this hypothesis, replacement of the methyl by a trifluoromethyl group in 45 maintains PPARR but increases PPAR potency and decreases PPAR potency. The phenyl-trifluoromethyl moiety makes a good fit into the lower pocket of the binding site and would be expected to contribute favorably to overall binding through van der Waals interactions. This observation is compatible with SAR data that show a relationship between size and lipophilicity of the parasubstituent and PPARR potency. The decrease in potency seen with compounds bearing polar para-substituents (25k and 25m) may be explained by the hydrophobic nature of the lower pocket. The inactivity of the methylsulfonyl analogue 25l may be due to a combination of polarity and steric constraints. metaSubstitution is well tolerated as evidenced by the fact that 25i is equipotent with 25a. Although the X-ray structure of 25a shows that one meta-position is directed toward Leu-247 and Ile-241, the other meta-position points into an open space and could easily accept a substituent. On the other hand, orthosubstitution would force the phenyl group out of plane with the thiazole and likely lead to a clash with the wall of the narrow pocket, a conjecture that is consistent with the decrease in potency seen with 25j. Pharmacokinetics in Rat and Dog (Table 6). Following intravenous administration of compound 25a (2.7 mg/kg) to the rat, distribution to the tissues was limited with the volume of distribution (1 L/kg) similar to that of total body water (0.6 L/kg). Total plasma clearance was low (5 mL/min/kg), representing about 6% of rat hepatic blood flow. The low clearance and moderate volume of distribution resulted in a plasma halflife of 2.4 h. Following a single oral dose of compound 25a at 3 mg/kg, the maximum concentration of compound in the plasma was 1461 ng/mL after 1.5 h. The bioavailability was high (47%). Following intravenous administration of compound 25a to the dog at 2 mg/kg, distribution to the tissues was limited with the volume of distribution (2.8 L/kg) being greater than that of

Several compounds in this series demonstrated profound in vivo activity in animal models of dyslipidemia, as illustrated by compound 25a. The human ApoA-I-transgenic mouse model has been proposed to be potentially relevant to human disease, because in this model, fibrates give upregulation rather than the repression of Apo-A-I seen in other rodent models.19 Compound 25a shows similar PPARR agonist potency and selectivity versus murine and human PPARs (murine PPAR EC50, R ) 15 nM;  ) 1000 nM;  > 10 000 nM).

in HDL cholesterol (+26%). The finding that 25a is able to lower LDLc and TG and increase HDL cholesterol in the ApoA-I-transgenic mouse model suggests that it will deliver significant therapeutic benefit in the treatment of dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Compound 25a (GW590735) has been progressed to clinical trials for the treatment of diseases of lipid imbalance. Conclusions Starting from the selective PPAR agonist 1, which showed weak potency on PPARR, we have developed a new series of highly potent and selective PPARR agonists, one of which, 25a, has progressed to clinical evaluation. The superior potency and PPAR subtype selectivity of 25a suggest that this compound offers the potential to deliver significantly improved therapeutic benefits over the fibrates in dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia.

Experimental Section
General Methods. All commercial chemicals and solvents are reagent grade and were used without further purification unless otherwise specified. All reactions except those in aqueous media were carried out with the use of standard techniques for the exclusion of moisture. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography on 0.25 mm silica gel plates (60F-254, E. Merck) and visualized with UV light or 5% phosphomolybdic acid in 95% ethanol. Final compounds were typically purified either by flash chromatography on silica gel (E. Merck, 40-63 mm) or by recrystallization. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on either a Brucker 300 MHz Avance DPX or a Bruker 400 MHz Avance DRX instrument. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm, d units).

Splitting patterns are designed as s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; bs, broad singlet. Low-resolution mass spectra (MS) were recorded on a Micromass platform LC or a Agilent GC/ MS spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on a Micromass LCT (TOF) spectrometer. Mass spectra were acquired in either positive or negative ion mode under electrospray ionization (ESI) or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) methods. Analytical high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; system A) was conducted on a Chromolith Performance RP 18 column (100 × 4.6 mm id) eluting with 0.01 M ammonium acetate in water and 100% acetonitrile (CH3CN), using the following elution gradient: 0 to 100% CH3CN over 4 min and 100% CH3CN over 1 min at 5 mL/min at a temperature of 30 °C. Analytical HPLC (system B) was conducted on a XTERRAMS C18 column (30 × 3 mm id, 2.5 µm) eluting with 0.01 M ammonium acetate in water and 100% acetonitrile (CH3CN), using the following elution gradient: 0 to 100% CH3CN over 4 min and 100% CH3CN over 1 min at 1.1 mL/min at a temperature of 40 °C. Analytical HPLC (system C) was conducted on a Uptispherehsc column (3 µm 33 × 3 mm id) eluting with 0.01 M ammonium acetate in water and 100% acetonitrile (CH3CN) using the following elution gradient: 0-5% CH3CN over 0.5 min, gradient 5-100% CH3CN over 3.25 min, and 100% CH3CN over 0.75 min at 1.3 mL/mn at a temperature of 40 °C. Analytical HPLC (system D) was conducted on a Uptispherehsc column (3 µm 33 × 3 mm id) eluting with 0.01 M ammonium acetate in water and 100% acetonitrile (CH3CN) using the following elution gradient: 0-5% CH3CN over 0.5 min, gradient 5-100% CH3CN over 6.25 min, and 100% CH3CN over 0.75 min at 1.3 mL/mn at a temperature of 40 °C. The purity of key compounds was determined on two analytic HPLC systems using UV detection. Pharmacokinetics in Rat and Dog. Compound 25a was administered to Wistar rats (n ) 15) by oral gavage at dose of 3 mg/kg in pH 7 buffer, 0.1% Tween80 and by intravenous injection via the penis vein (n ) 30) at a dose of 2.7 mg/kg in 10% DMSO and PEG200. Compound 25a was administered orally to male beagle dogs (n ) 3) by stomach intubation at a dose of 3 mg/kg in pH 7 buffer, 0.1% Tween80 and by intravenous injection via the cephalic vein at a dose of 2 mg/kg in 10% DMSO and PEG200. Blood samples were placed on wet ice, and plasma was collected after centrifugation. Plasma samples were stored frozen at -20 °C until time of analysis. Plasma samples (0.5 mL) were diluted with 1:1 buffer (NaH2PO4, 0.1 M, pH 4) and then extracted with ethyl acetate (5 mL). The ethyl acetate was evaporated, and the residue was resuspended in 200 µL of mobile phase (water/acetonitrile/ TFA; 30v/70v/0.1%). Samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography spectrometric analysis (LC/MS/MS). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by SIPHAR. Apo-A-I Transgenic Mouse Model. Male C57BL/6 mice transgenic for human ApoA-I were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (L'Arbresle, France) and randomized into treatment groups of n ) 5 animals. Twice a day oral administration of vehicle (0.5% HPMC/1% Tween80, pH ) 7.0) or indicated doses of compound as a suspension began when animals were nine weeks old and lasted for 5 days. Animals were fasted overnight before blood samples were taken by intracardiac puncture. Whole liver was collected and weighed. Blood samples were left for 30 min at 37 °C to coagulate and centrifuged 10 min at 10 000 rpm. Total serum fraction was then collected and frozen at -20 °C until use. Total cholesterol and total TG were dosed using kits 61219 and 61236, respectively, following manufacturer instructions (Bio Merieux, Marcy-l'etoile, France). After 10 min of incubation at 37 ´ ´ °C, the colorimetric reaction was read at 492 nm with an iEMS reader (ThermoLife Sciences, Cergy-Pontoise, France). Cholesterol HDL, LDL, and VLDL fractions were separated by HPLC. Samples were diluted 1/5 in phosphate buffer (Ca++ and Mg- free) and filtered on 0.45 µm to remove excess proteins before HPLC. All changes reported with an asterisk are statistically significant (p < 0.05) as determined by one-way ANOVA analysis.

Protein Preparation. The PPARR ligand binding domain (amino acids 192-468) with an N-terminal 6xHis tag was expressed using the T7 promoter of plasmid vector pRSETA. BL21(DE3) E. coli cells transformed with this expression vector were grown at 24 °C in shaker flasks for 66 h. The cells were harvested, resuspended, and lysed. The lysed cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded on a Ni-agarose column. The column was washed with 150 mL of buffer A (10% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 25 mM imidazole), and the protein was eluted with a 450 mL gradient of buffer B (10% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM imidazole). The protein, which eluted at 20% buffer B, was diluted with one volume of buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) and loaded on a 100 mL S-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Peapack, New Jersey) column. The column was washed with 100 mL buffer C, and the PPARR LBD protein was eluted with a 200 mL gradient of buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT, 1 M ammonium acetate). The PPARR LBD eluted from the column at 43% buffer D. The protein yield was 9 mg/L of cells grown and was >95% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. The protein was then diluted to 1 mg/mL with buffer C such that the final buffer composition was 220 mM ammonium acetate, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT. The peptide SRC116 was added in a molar ratio of 1.5 as a 2 mg/100 µL DMSO stock. The ligand was then added in a 5:1 molar ratio as a 2 mg/ 100 µL DMSO stock and spun at 4 K for 20 min to clarify the solution before concentrating in Centriprep 10 filtration units (Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts). The solution containing the PPARR LBD-SRC1 complexes was concentrated to approximately 10 mg/mL with 80% yield. Crystallization and Data Collection. The crystals were grown at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method.
