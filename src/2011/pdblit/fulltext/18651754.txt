The secreted form of the PilB protein was proposed to be involved in pathogen survival fighting against the defensive host's oxidative burst. PilB protein is composed of three domains. The central and the C-terminal domains display methionine sulfoxide reductase A and B activities, respectively. The N-terminal domain, which possesses a CXXC motif, was recently shown to regenerate in Vitro the reduced forms of the methionine sulfoxide reductase domains of PilB from their oxidized forms, as does the thioredoxin 1 from E. coli, Via a disulfide bond exchange. The thioredoxin-like N-terminal domain belongs to the cytochrome maturation protein structural family, but it possesses a unique additional segment (99)FLHE(102) localized in a loop. This segment covers one edge of the active site in the crystal structure of the reduced form of the N-terminal domain of PilB. We have determined the solution structure and the dynamics of the N-terminal domain from Neisseria meningitidis, in its reduced and oxidized forms. The FLHE loop adopts, in both redox states, a well-defined conformation. Subtle conformational and dynamic changes upon oxidation are highlighted around the active site, as well as in the FLHE loop. The functional consequences of the cytochrome maturation protein topology and those of the presence of FLHE loop are discussed in relation to the enzymatic properties of the N-terminal domain.

ABSTRACT:

Various pathogenic and invasive bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis have recourse to methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr)1 to repair oxidative damages caused on protein methionine residues by the immune system of their host. Two stereospecific Msrs reduce, back to methionine, one of the two isomers of the methionine sulfoxide function (MetSO) formed upon oxidation. MsrA is specific of the Met-(S)-SO, while MsrB reduces only the Met-(R)-SO. Although completely distinct in both their primary, secondary, and tertiary structures, MsrA and MsrB follow a similar three-step catalytic mechanism involving in the last step the reduction,

by thioredoxin (Trx), of the oxidized Msr under disulfide state (1­3). Examples of the fusion of the MsrA and MsrB domains into a single protein are known. In that context, the PilB proteins from Neisseria genus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Psychrobacter cryohalolentis2 are unique in that they possess a supplementary N-terminal domain. In fact, two protein forms in Neisseria gonorrheae were shown to be produced in ViVo (4). One form, which contains the three domains, i.e., the N-terminal domain and the central and C-terminal domains that display MsrA and MsrB activities, respectively (2), is secreted from the bacterial cytoplasm to the outer membrane, whereas the second form, which is cytoplasmic, only contains the Msr domains. The secreted form was proposed to be involved in the pathogen survival fighting against the defensive host's oxidative burst. Recently, the N-terminal domain (NterPilB) from Neisseria meningitidis was shown to display disulfide oxidoreductase activity toward the PilB Msr domains in Vitro (5). The structure in its reduced form (NterPilBred) as well as that from N. gonorrheae was determined by X-ray crystallography (6, 7). The analysis of NterPilBred X-ray structure from N. meningitidis (6) has revealed strong structural

Quinternet et al. titration with DTNB as previously described (5). The NMR sample contained 0.5 mM protein concentration (95% H2O, 5% D2O) in 30 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). NMR Spectroscopy. All spectra were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker DRX 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Spectra were processed using the program XWINNMR (Bruker) and analyzed with the programs XEASY (17) and CARA (18). TSP-d4 (Euriso-top) was used as an internal reference for 1H chemical shift whereas indirect referencing was used for 13C and 15N chemical shifts (19). Backbone amide 1HN, 15N, 13CR, 1HR, 13C, and side-chain 1 H, 13C resonances were assigned using 1H-15N HSQC, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCANH, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNHA experiments. HNHB, HCCHTOCSY, CC(CO)NH, and 1H-15N, 1H-13C HSQC-NOESY spectra at two different mixing times (70 and 100 ms) were also performed for side-chain assignments. Hydrogen bonds were identified using slow amide proton exchange in D2O solution (20) and temperature dependence at five different temperatures (287, 291, 296, 298, and 305 K) (21). Structure Calculations. Interproton distance restraints were derived from three-dimensional 1H-13C/15N HSQC-NOESY experiments. The NOE cross-peaks were first classified as strong, medium, and weak and converted into upper limits of 2.5, 3.5, and 5.5 Å and then refined after the first run of calculation. Restraints for the pseudoatoms were systematically overestimated. Each hydrogen bond restraint was defined as a couple of distance restraints with an upper limit of 2.4 Å between the acceptor heavy atom and the hydrogen atom and an upper limit of 3.3 Å between the acceptor and donor heavy atoms. Restraint for the disulfide bond was defined as a set of three distance restraints: the distance between the two sulfur atoms Si and Sj lies between 2.0 and 2.1 Å; the distance between the C i and Sj lies between 3.0 and 3.1 Å; the distance between Si and C l lies between 3.0 and 3.1 Å. Torsion restraints for the  and  angles were derived from the program TALOS (22), and all of the peptide bonds were kept planar and trans, with the exception of that between Tyr139 and Pro140 which was restrained to be planar and cis, on the basis of the C and C chemical shifts of Pro140 (C ) 35.44 ppm, C ) 25.21 ppm) (23). A total of 1000 randomized structures were calculated, and the simulated annealing process was performed for the reduced and the oxidized forms of NterPilB using respectively the programs DYANA (24) and CYANA (25). The 20 structures with the lowest target function were selected and refined using DISCOVER (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Figures were drawn with the programs MOLMOL (26) and INSIGHT II. 15 N Relaxation Experiments. The 15N longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), 15N transverse relaxation rate (R2), and the steady-state {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer, using the usual pulse sequences (27). A total of 256 (15N) and 2048 (1H) complex points were collected for the R1 and R2 experiments, with 8 transients/increment and a recycle delay of 5 s. Ten inversion recovery delays of 2, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 ms were used for R1 measurement, whereas eight delays of 8, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 112, and 144 ms were used during the CPMG (Carr-PurcellMeiboom-Gill) period of the R2 experiments. {1H}-15N

homologies with DsbEs.3 DsbEs like CcmG from Escherichia coli (8), CycY from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (9), TlpA from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (10), and ResA from Bacillus subtilis (11) are enzymes which are involved in cytochrome maturation pathway. Like the X-ray structures of these cytochrome maturation proteins (CMPs) (12­15), the overall structure of NterPilB consists of a Trx-like fold defined as a mixed four-stranded -sheet surrounded by three R-helices, with two insertions compared to the canonical Trxfold. The first insertion, from Val33 to Lys56 residues, is located in the N-terminal region, the numbering following that of the entire PilB from N. meningitidis (2). The second insertion, from Phe99 to Asn126 residues, gives rise to an additional -strand and an R-helix. However, NterPilB differs from the CMPs by the presence of an additional loop (99)FLHE(102) in the second insertion, near the active site. Recently, Zhang et al. (16) have solved by NMR the solution structures of the reduced and oxidized forms of YkuV from B. subtilis whose function remains to be determined but which possesses a CMP topology, with an additional loop as NterPilB. In the present study, we have determined the solution structure of NterPilB in its reduced (NterPilBred) and oxidized (NterPilBox) forms and characterized their dynamic properties. The results are compared between the two redox forms so as to detect possible structural or dynamic changes occurring upon the formation of the disulfide bond between Cys67 and Cys70. The functional consequences of the CMP topology and those of the presence of FLHE loop are discussed in relation to the enzymatic properties of NterPilB. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Preparation. The E. coli strain used for NterPilB (33-175) production was BL21-DE3 pLysS transformed with a pETNterPilB plasmid. 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled samples were prepared by growing cells in a minimal media with 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source and with glucose, 13 C-labeled or not, as the only carbon source. The Nter-PilB production was induced at an OD600 of 0.6 by addition of 1 mM IPTG and harvested after 4 h for the 15N/13C protein and 16 h for the 15N protein. Purification was done as previously described (5), and sample purity and molecular mass were checked by SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry, respectively. The oxidation of the NterPilB was achieved by incubating NterPilB (0.5 mM) with 5,5dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (1 mM) in a degassed solution of 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at room temperature, for 10 min whereas the reduced form sample was kept in its reduced state by adding 50 mM 1,5dithiothreitol-d10. The two samples were isolated by gel filtration on an Econo-Pac 10 DG column (Bio-Rad Laboratory) equilibrated with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The oxidation state of the N-terminal domain was checked by

NMR Structure and Dynamics of NterPilB NOE spectra were recorded in an interleaved way with and without proton saturation during relaxation delay, using 256 × 2 (15N) and 2048 (1H) complex points and 56 transients/ increment typically. The 15N saturation was achieved by the application of 120° 15N pulses separated by 5 ms, for a period of 4 s. Spectral widths for all heteronuclear experiments were 2433 Hz (15N) and 8389 Hz (1H) with carrier frequencies at 117.6 and 4.70 ppm, respectively. Data were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker). They were zero-filled in the 15N dimension and apodized with shifted square sine-bell window in both dimensions. Backbone Dynamics Analysis. NMRVIEW software (28) version 6.6.2 was used to measure the peak heights of the 15 N-1H cross-peaks and to determine the R1 and R2 values from a fit to a single-exponential decay function and also the {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE from the ratio between the intensities of a peak in the spectra collected with and without proton saturation, respectively. All experiments were performed twice to provide an estimation of the uncertainty on R1, R2, and NOE values. R1, R2, and NOE relaxation parameters were analyzed by means of reduced spectral density mapping at Jeff(0), J(N), and J(H) values (29­32), using a chemical shift anisotropy of -160 ppm for the backbone amide group (33) and a NH bond length of 1.02 Å. Jeff(0) denotes that the exchange contribution to R2 is not explicitly considered (34). J(H) is the average of J(H), J(H + N), and J(H - N) which can be approximated by J(0.87H) (29). Tensor2 (35) was used for the Lipari-Szabo analysis (36, 37) of the backbone 15N relaxation parameters. Only residues in secondary structure elements were used for determination of the overall tumbling. pH Titration. A 0.5 mM sample of NterPilB in 10 mM phosphate buffer initially at pH 7 was used for the chemical shift titration. The pH was adjusted by adding small volumes of 1 N HCl or NaOH solutions. TROSY experiments were recorded at nine pH values: 5.50, 6.05, 6.56, 6.88, 7.13, 7.41, 7.71, 8.11, and 8.61 for the reduced form; 5.53, 5.92, 6.29, 6.68, 6.93, 7.30, 7.69, 8.04, and 9.02 for the oxidized form. The pH of the sample was measured before and after the recording of each spectrum, and the average value was taken as the effective pH. Proton chemical shifts of each residue were fitted to obs ) d + /[1 + 10(pH-pKa)] using KALEIDAGRAPH (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). RESULTS Structure Calculations of NterPilBred and NterPilBox. NterPilB has been studied in a soluble form ranging from Val33 to Leu175. The chemical shift assignments for the reduced and oxidized forms have been reported previously (38, 39). For these two forms, a nearly complete assignment of the backbone and of the side chains has been realized except for the sequence Val33 to His35, residues Ser137 and Pro171. Residues Thr36, Tyr51, Lys54, and Ala84 on the one hand and residues Val50 and Lys61 on the other hand remain only partially assigned in the reduced and in the oxidized forms, respectively. There are approximately 30% fewer short-range and long-range NOE correlations for the reduced form, mainly in the Ser49-Asp55, Gln109-Pro118, and Ala166-Leu175 regions for which several residues are stacked with others. The corresponding NOE correlations

are unclear, which led us to ignore them in the structure calculations. The NMR solution structures of both forms were calculated using NOE-derived restraints, backbone dihedral angle restraints derived from TALOS prediction, and hydrogen bond restraints obtained from the 1H/2H exchange combined to the temperature dependence experiments. The superimpositions of the 20 representative structures for each form are shown in Figure 1a,b and the structural statistics for both forms are summarized in Table 1. For the NterPilBred, no distance restraint violation greater than 0.1 Å and no dihedral angle violation greater than 5° are found. According to PROCHECK-NMR analysis, all the non-glycine and the non-proline residues lie in the authorized regions of the Ramachandran plot. For residues Thr39 to Asp170, the 20 structures exhibit an atomic rmsd from the mean structure of 0.79 ( 0.13 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.54 ( 0.13 Å for all heavy atoms. By excluding the regions with high rmsds (Supporting Information Figure S1) and thus keeping only the well-defined Leu40-Ala48, Lys56Gln109, and Lys119-Leu165 segments which represent 76% of the backbone, the atomic rmsds fall to 0.50 ( 0.08 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.01 ( 0.13 Å for all heavy atoms. For the NterPilBox, three distance restraint violations greater than 0.1 Å and two dihedral angle violations greater than 5° are observed. According to PROCHECK-NMR analysis, 79.0% of the non-glycine and the non-proline residues remain in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot whereas 19.4% of the whole residues are in

the additionally allowed regions and 1.6% of the residues (corresponding to Leu100 and to Asp174) are in the disallowed regions. For residues Thr39 to Asp170, the 20 structures exhibit an atomic rmsd from the mean structure of 0.57 ( 0.13 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.27 ( 0.13 Å for all heavy atoms. In the oxidized form, fewer problems of signal overlapping were encountered, which explains that up to 91% of the backbone is well defined (Supporting Information Figure S1). However, if we only retain the previously selected regions (Leu40-Ala48, Lys56-Gln109, and Lys119-Leu165) to provide a comparison with the reduced form, the atomic rmsds become 0.45 ( 0.08 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.07 ( 0.13 Å for all heavy atoms. In these regions, the rmsd values are therefore similar in the two redox states (the comparison between the structures of the two forms leads to rmsds of 0.82 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.22 Å for all heavy atoms). With the exception of Ala, Gly, and Pro residues, analysis of the 1 values and their standard deviations shows that 69% and 64% of residues are well defined respectively for the oxidized and reduced forms. In particular, the low values of standard deviations associated to 1 values show that the side chain of most residues of the active site (Trp63-Glu73) and its vicinity (Ser137-Tyr139) and of the loop FLHE (Phe99Glu102) are well defined. The  and  dihedral angles are calculated for the mean structure, and their standard deviations are estimated from those of the 20 representative structures. In parallel to atomic rmsds, all  and  dihedral angles are well defined with low standard deviations except for the Met32-Thr36, Asp44-Asn45, Leu52-Lys56, Leu115Pro118, Asp125-Asn126, Ile136-Ser137, and Ala173-Leu175 sequences for which large standard deviation values are observed and are indicative of less defined structural parts. Conformational changes are highlighted by the large difference of the  and  dihedral angle values by comparing

the well-defined parts of NterPilB (Figure 2). The standard deviations of the dihedral value differences are taken as the sum of the individual standard deviations of  and  calculated for the reduced and oxidized forms. Structure Analysis of Reduced and Oxidized NterPilB. The overall structures of NterPilBred and NterPilBox are very similar (Figure 1c,d). The core of both forms exhibits mainly a five-stranded -sheet composed of parallel (p) and antiparallel (a) individual strands. These latter are arranged in a 3(p) 2(p) 1(a) 4(a) 5(a) pattern and comprise consensually, in both forms, residues Thr58 to Phe62 for 1, Asn90 to Ala95 for 2, Val122 to Thr125 for 3, Ser 141 to Ile145 for 4, and Val151 to Val155 for 5. This main -sheet network is flanked by five helices comprising consensually residues Pro68 to Trp80 for R1, Ala84 to Ser87 for R2, Asp107 to Tyr112 for R3, Thr129 to Ser133 for R4, and Glu161 to Arg169 for R5. In NterPilBred, the five helices are R-type helices. In NterPilBox, the R-helix R1 is split into two helices separated by a turn formed by residues Ser72 and Glu73, and the helix R2 is defined as a 310-helix instead of an R-helix. The detection of hydrogen-bonded NH groups in the N-terminal region (residues Val33 to Thr39) suggests that this segment may adopt an R-helix organization (helix R0). However, probably due to the lack of NOE-derived and dihedral informations on these residues, no well-defined secondary structure is obtained, in particular for NterPilBox. The large dispersion of this segment, as indicated by its high rmsd values (1.57 ( 0.67 Å and 0.99 ( 0.43 Å for the backbone of NterPilBox and NterPilBred respectively), probably disturbs the stabilization of the 0 strand. Indeed, an additional little antiparallel 0 strand, comprising the residues Lys41 and Thr42, is present in 14 out of the 20 selected structures of NterPilBred and in 10 out of the 20 selected structures of NterPilBox. Moreover, an additional 310-helix comprising residues Ala48 to Tyr51 is present in 17 of the 20 selected structures of Nter-PilBred and only in 8 of the 20 selected structures of Nter-PilBox, this probably due to the poor assignment of Val50 in the oxidized form in spite of measured hydrogen-bonded NH groups. Two other regions, far from the active site and for which few NOEs are observed, are also ill-defined: in the vicinity

NMR Structure and Dynamics of NterPilB of Lys54 in both redox forms, and the 113-117 segment, especially in the reduced form. For these segments and for the N- and C-terminal parts, the  and  dihedral angle values differ notably between the reduced and oxidized forms. The standard deviation, calculated for the dihedral value differences in these regions which exhibit few NMR restraints, is high (Figure 2). Thus, these differences are not significant. On the other hand, large and significant  (ox - red) and  (ox - red) differences of the backbone dihedral angle values [ for Ala64 (-30.1 ( 8.4 °), Cys67 (-36 ( 9.6 °), Cys70 (-27.4 ( 4.2 °), His101 (141.1 ( 7.6 °), Val138 (37.8 ( 17.2 °), Gly157 (-54.5 ( 9.7 °), Ile159 (66.4 ( 9 °) and  for Trp66 (36.8 ( 7.4 °), Leu100 (-119.2 ( 11.8 °), Ser 137 (-49.3 ( 17.5 °), Lys156 (-52.4 ( 8.1 °), Ser158 (-58.5 ( 9.8 °), Glu161 (32.9 ( 12 °), superior to 25° and combined with a weak standard deviation] upon redox change of Nter-PilB are observed for Cys67, Cys70, and neighboring residues (Ala64 and Trp66), as well as for particular residues located in the 2-R3 and 5-R5 loops, that denotes a rearranging of some active site segments. Analysis of the 13C chemical shift differences of backbone carbonyl groups reveals regions of significant variation between the reduced and the oxidized forms of NterPilB (Supporting Information Figure S2). Residues surrounding the active cysteines are principally perturbed. That concerns residues Phe62, Ala64, Ser65, Cys67 to Ser72, Phe99 to His101, Pro140, and Ser141. These chemical shift data are consistent with the previously reported data concerning backbone amide groups (39) and with local structural changes in the neighborhood of the active site occurring upon oxidation. Other but isolated residues are also perturbed (Leu37, Ala43, Leu52, and Gly118). 15 N Relaxation Parameters. The 15N longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), 15N transverse relaxation rate (R2), and the steadystate {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE values of NterPilB were measured for 121 and 122 backbone NH groups out of the 135 nonproline residues, respectively in the reduced and oxidized forms (Figure 3). The unanalyzed residues were either unassigned or overlapped. The average values for the backbone 15N nuclei are very similar in the two redox states: R1 ) 1.57 ( 0.02 s-1, R2 ) 10.3 ( 0.3 s-1, NOE ) 0.80 ( 0.02 s-1 in the reduced form and R1 ) 1.55 ( 0.04 s-1, R2 ) 10.9 ( 0.2 s-1, NOE ) 0.82 ( 0.02 s-1 in the oxidized form. The relaxation parameters plotted versus the polypeptidic sequence globally display similar profiles in the two redox forms. For instance, a sharp drop of all three parameters is found within the C-terminus. But the most striking point is a particularly large R2 value for residue His101 in the reduced form. Reduced Spectral Density Mapping. Reduced spectral density mapping, which does not require any model for the global motion and for the internal motion, was used first to analyze the relaxation data. Jeff(0), J(N), and J(H) spectral density values were calculated for the 121 and 122 NH groups for which the relaxation parameters could be determined respectively in the reduced and oxidized state (see Materials and Methods). As shown in Figure 4, the variations of spectral density values along the sequence are globally similar in both redox states. For instance, a decrease of Jeff(0) together with an increase of J(H) is observed within the C-terminus, and to a lesser extent around residues Lys53

and Ser158. This indicates flexibility in the C-terminal tail, as well as in the 310- 1 and 5-R5 loops. Similar decreases in these regions are observed for the J(N) values, which are found to exhibit a pattern rather similar to that of Jeff(0), exept residues undergoing chemical exchange. Indeed, in both redox states, Jeff(0) value of residue His101 is clearly higher than the average one, suggesting a large µs-ms time scale chemical exchange. However, in the oxidized form, this value is not as high as in the reduced form. Chemical exchange is likely to be found too in the segment Cys70Leu74 and for residue Val138, which display, especially in the oxidized form, Jeff(0) values slightly above the average, while their J(N) and J(H) values are not particularly low (40). Differences between the two forms can be clearly highlighted when the differences between spectral density values are plotted. Indeed, two main regions, the segment Trp63Thr77 containing the Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys motif and part of the 2-R3 (FLHE) loop (residues His101-Lys103), appear to exhibit differences larger than two standard deviations from the average (Figure 4) for at least one of the three spectral density values. Remarkably, in the Trp63-Thr77 segment, difference of J(N) (J(N)) between the oxidized and reduced forms is mainly negative for residues Trp63Trp66 in the 1-R1 loop whereas difference of Jeff(0)

(Jeff(0)) is mainly positive for residues Leu69-Thr77 at the beginning of the R1 helix. This indicates that the formation of the disulfide bridge leads to a slight decrease of fast time scale motions in the 1-R1 loop containing the catalytic Cys67 together with a slight increase of the slow time scale motions in the R1 helix bearing the recycling Cys70. Model-Free Analysis. To get a more detailed picture of the dynamics of NterPilB, the relaxation parameters were analyzed with a Lipari-Szabo approach (36, 37), by means of the Tensor2 software (35) and using the mean NMR structure. An anisotropic tensor giving a global correlation time c of 7.51 ( 0.01 ns and 7.86 ( 0.01 ns, an axial anisotropy of 1.15 and 1.12, and a rhombicity of 1.06 and 1.04 respectively in the reduced and the oxidized forms was found. These values as well as the orientation of the tensor axes are in agreement with the molecule inertia tensor (the principal components of which are in the ratios 1:0.93:0.68), indicating a monomeric state. Internal mobility parameters were obtained for Lys104 and Phe108 residues respectively in the reduced and in the oxidized forms. A few residues, including the catalytic cysteine Cys67, Leu100, and Lys103 in the reduced form, and the recycling Cys70, residues Gly98-Leu100, Glu102 in the oxidized form, could not be correctly fitted and had therefore to be discarded from the analysis. The mean order parameter is 0.90 in the reduced form and 0.92 in the oxidized form. In both forms, the order

parameter decreases in the 310- 1 loop (residues Leu52 to Lys56), in the 5-R5 loop (residues Lys156 to Ser158), and in the C-terminal region (residues Asn172 to Leu175) as shown in Figure 5. Relatively low values are also found here and there, generally in loops or at the end of some helices or sheets (residues Asp107, Val151). Internal correlation time was found mainly in the regions Lys40-Lys56 and Asp150Gly157 and in the C-terminus, far from the active site. As expected, a large exchange term Rex is found for residue His101, especially in the reduced state. Smaller Rex terms are also observed in the R1 helix (residues Cys70-Leu74), and the R4- 4 loop (residues Leu134-Val138) and punctually for residues Leu52 and Ile159 in both forms. pH Titration and pH Effect on Dynamics Parameters. Rex parameter, which indicates chemical exchange, usually reflects conformational exchange. Yet, the residue His101 with surprisingly large Rex value appears to be a His residue, the side chain of which usually has a pKa around 6.8 in solution, thus very close to the sample pH. Since His101 is located in the critical FLHE loop, a titration study and a relaxation study at different pHs were carried out to determine whether the His101 exchange term originates from large conformational changes or is simply related to the pH conditions. The 1H and 15N chemical shifts of the backbone and of the tryptophan side-chain NH groups were measured at nine pH values, ranging from pH 9 to pH 5.5. Superimposition

of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra reveals that most cross-peaks remain unchanged, suggesting that the three-dimensional structure is conserved. The largest variations are observed for the 1H chemical shift of the backbone NH of Leu100, His101 and the side-chain NH of Trp66 in both redox states. These observed chemical shifts correctly fit a simple Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, leading to a pKa ) 6.8 ( 0.1 in both redox states. This pKa value likely corresponds to that of the His101 imidazole side chain, which is the closest titrable element to those nuclei experiencing large chemical shift variations (Figure 6). Moreover, the solution structure shows that the imidazole ring is exposed to solvent and is therefore expected to have a pKa value close to that of the free amino acid, which is precisely 6.8. A new set of relaxation parameters was recorded at pH 5.5 for both redox forms and analyzed with a Lipari-Szabo approach, in the same manner as for pH 7. In both redox states, dynamics results were globally similar to those at pH 7, except that the Rex value of His101 falls dramatically from 14.9 s-1 down to 1.9 s-1 in the reduced form and equals zero in the oxidized form (Figure 5d). DISCUSSION Global Structures and Dynamics of NterPilB in Solution. The solution structure of NterPilBred from N. meningitidis exhibits the same folding as the X-ray structure. Backbone superimposition (for residues Thr39 to Asp170) leads to a rmsd of 1.04 Å (Figure 7a). The locations of the secondary structures are similar. The R-helix R0, the strand 0, and the 310-helix in the N-terminal region, found in the majority of

the 20 NMR structures, are present in the X-ray structure. However, exceptions can be highlighted. First, the end of strand 1 is one residue shorter in all NMR reduced structures, as in the X-ray structure of the reduced N-terminal domain of PilB from N. gonorrheae. Second, the beginning of helix R1 is slightly bent but continuous, whereas it shows a break at residues Ser72 and Glu73 in the crystal structure. Nevertheless, no drastic changes concerning the side chains of the residues around the active site are observed between the NMR and the X-ray structures of NterPilBred (Figure 7b). DALI (41) and VAST (42) have been used to search for structural homologues of the NterPilBred NMR solution structure in the PDB (43). In addition to the CMPs previously identified, the newly reported structure of YkuV from B. subtilis can be included to the structural comparison with NterPilB and CMPs, based on its scores of superimposition (DALI Z-score ) 9.8; VAST-score ) 9.8). NterPilB and CMPs all contain a Trx-like fold defined as a mixed fourstranded -sheet surrounded by three R-helices. A structural alignment of NterPilB, E. coli DsbE, and YkuV with E. coli Trx1 shows the presence of a long insertion between residues Gln62 and Asn63 of Trx1 (corresponding to residues Gly98 and Gly128 in Figure 8). As described before for NterPilB and CMPs, this segment gives rise to an additional R-helix and a -strand. Interestingly, this segment in NterPilB and YkuV is longer than in other CMPs and forms an additional loop. These two proteins appear to possess a segment of similar length leading to a YkuV (71)RSED(74) loop equivalent in length to the NterPilB (99)FLHE(102) loop. NterPilB would therefore be closer to YkuV than other CMPs. Moreover, our NMR study provides additional dynamics information in solution. The Lipari-Szabo analysis of the relaxation parameters shows that NterPilB is a relatively rigid protein globally, with a mean order parameter of 0.91 for its backbone. Low order parameters in both redox forms are found for the C-terminal extremities, in the 310- 1 loop

(residues Leu52-Lys56) and the 5-R5 loop (residues Lys156-Ser158) as well as for residues Asp107 and Val151 at the beginning of R3 helix and 5 sheet, respectively (Figure 9). The flexibility highlighted in these regions is supported by the reduced spectral density mapping exhibiting low Jeff(0) values compensated for by high J(H) values. The high rmsd around Lys54, observed both in the solution and in the crystal structures, can therefore be explained by a large backbone flexibility. In contrast, the poor resolution obtained for segment Ala113-Tyr117 in the reduced form is more likely due to a lack of experimental NOEs and angle restraints, as no particular dynamics is observed. Although experimental relaxation data are missing for the first four residues Val33-Thr36, high order parameters are found in the Leu37-Thr39 segment, in agreement with the assumption that the N-terminal region may form an R-helix, as in the crystal structure. Nevertheless, this N-terminal helix would not be well characterized because of the lack of NMR restraints. In fact, apart for the putative CMP YkuV (16), no 15N relaxation studies have been reported yet for CMPs as they were all studied in the crystal state. As far as we know, the only other dynamics data available on homologous proteins are for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii oxidized Trx m (44) and for E. coli oxidized and reduced Trxs (45). Our dynamics results were therefore discussed in comparison with YkuV and those thioredoxins. The increased flexibility observed for the 310- 1 loop in NterPilB was also found in the homologous loop of Trxs and YkuV. However, it is located on the opposite side of the active site and may not be of functional importance. In contrast, the flexible 5-R5 loop is part of the active site and the homologous 5-R5 loop, in C. reinhardtii (44) and E. coli (45) Trxs, was reported to exhibit low order parameter as well. Unfortunately, this could

not be generalized to YkuV since data are missing in this region. However, this loop flexibility, which seems to be recurrent, could be mandatory for its interaction with a biological partner. Interestingly, in the single docking calculated model of YkuV complexed with ArsC, this loop seems to largely participate to interaction. As far as the R44 loop is concerned, slow microsecond to millisecond time scale conformational exchange is found in NterPilB whereas subnanosecond time scale flexibility was reported in the C. reinhardtii and E. coli Trxs. Conformational exchange is observed in the 1-R1 loop and R1 helix bearing the catalytic and recycling cysteins in NterPilB as well as in E. coli Trx reduced form and in YkuV. Whereas a large segment comprising the R2- 3 loop and the 3 strand in YkuV displays significant chemical exchange, only a few residues in the corresponding region of NterPilB have a small Rex contribution. The dynamics differences evidenced in the Trxs and Trx-like proteins, along with the presence of the specific insertion in NterPilB, may contribute to explain the specificities of each protein. Induced Redox Changes in the ActiVe Site. Backbone superimposition (from Thr39 to Asp170 residues) of NterPilBred and NterPilBox solution structures leads to a relatively low rmsd value of 1.16 Å, suggesting that the formation of the disulfide bond does not affect dramatically the global folding of the enzyme (Figure 7c). However, the mean distance between the two sulfur atoms of Cys67 and Cys70 decreases from 3.54 ( 0.55 Å to 2.10 ( 0.03 Å in NterPilBred and NterPilBox, respectively. In NterPilBox, the presence of the disulfide bridge seems to freeze the conformation of the beginning of R1 helix and to induce a break (Figure 7c,d). This helix is locally bent by a turn formed with the residues Ser72 and Glu73. The central axis of the two resulting parts of R1 helix shows a larger deviation than in NterPilBred.

Whatever the oxidation state, the conformation of the active site of both forms appears similar and side chains for residues surrounding the two cysteines lie in the same orientation as shown in Figure 7d. Indeed, except chemical shift variation data suspecting that ResA may undergo localized conformational change between oxidation states (46), in the other CMPs crystal structures and YkuV NMR structures, the presence of the disulfide bond seems to not affect dramatically the global Trx-like fold either. One can notice that the break after the first four residues of R1 helix in N. meningitidis NterPilBox NMR solution structures was observed too in the X-ray structures of NterPilBred from N. meningitidis and N. gonorrheae. On the contrary, in NterPilBred NMR solution structure and in Trx, DsbE, ResA, TlpA, and YkuV structures (in the reduced or oxidized states), this helix can still be considered as continuous, although slightly distorted. The dynamic and structural studies suggest that the 3D structures of both reduced and

oxidized forms are well defined, rigid, and almost similar. However, a more in-depth examination of the backbone dihedral angle parameters made it possible to highlight, through the comparison between the  and  angle values of the two reduced and oxidized forms, significant structural changes upon oxidation of NterPilB especially concerning the active cysteines and surrounding residues Ala64 and Trp66 and also in the neighboring 2-R3 and 5-R5 loops. This suggests that a fine rearranging of the Trp66-Cys67, Leu69-Cys70, Lys156-Gly157, Ser158-Ile159 bonds and of the Ile136-Val138 segment is concomitant to disulfide bridge formation. The low values of the standard deviations estimated for these differences show that it corresponds to rigid and well-defined structures of protein rather than to ill-defined regions as those where high values of the standard deviations were estimated. These conformational changes are supported by the observation of significant chemical shift

Quinternet et al. the FLHE loop. This indicates a high conservation level of this structural element, between the crystal and the solution structures. However, the rmsd value between the reduced and the oxidized NMR structures for this same segment is increased up to 0.61 Å for the backbone atoms and decreased down to 0.99 Å for the heavy atoms. Indeed, the  dihedral angle of Leu100 and the  dihedral angle of His101 switch from 35.2 ( 11.8° to -84.0 ( 0.8° and from 62.1 ( 7.6° to -156.8 ( 2.7° respectively between the reduced and the oxidized state. This promotes a reorientation of Leu100-CO and His101-NH groups. Even if the global backbone orientation and the side-chain positions for residues Phe99 to Glu102 show no drastic changes, subtle structural differences do exist between reduced and oxidized forms at this precise spot. The relaxation data have been inspected particularly and cautiously for the FLHE loop. The order parameters observed in the FLHE loop were all higher than 0.91, suggesting very restricted vibrational motions. However, one has to keep in mind that several mobility data are missing in the loop, especially for the residues that could not be reliably fitted by the Tensor2 program. For that reason, a redox comparison of the mobility parameters in the FLHE loop was possible on His101 only, the only residue for which the Lipari-Szabo analysis could be performed in both states. His101 order parameter did not show any significant variation. As far as its exchange term is concerned, the dramatically large value (14.9 s-1) obtained in the reduced form at pH 7 appears to fall down to 1.9 s-1 at pH 5.5. Comparable effects have been reported by Hass et al. in plastocyanin (47), for its two His, one with a pKa of 7.1 and the other, ligated to a Cu(I) ion, with a pKa of 5.1. Indeed, the exchange terms observed for the nuclei close to the His side chain are assigned to the protonation/deprotonation equilibrium of the ionizable group and, therefore, follow a pH-dependent function reaching a maximum for pH ) pKa (47). A pH titration from pH 5.5 to 9 of NterPilB showed that Leu100, His101 backbone NHs and the Trp66 side-chain NH experienced the largest chemical shift variations, which leads to a pKa value estimated at 6.8 in both redox states. This pKa value precisely corresponds to that of the His free amino acid and is logically assigned to the His101 imidazole side chain, which is largely exposed to solvent (Figure 9b). Our results therefore point out that the large exchange term observed at pH 7 for the His101 backbone NH group mostly originates from the protonation/deprotonation of the side chain and not from a large conformational change. This phenomenon is also present in the oxidized form, Rex decreasing from 2.5 s-1 at pH 7 to zero at pH 5.5. However, the Rex value at pH 7 is smaller than that in the reduced form, although the pKa values of His101 side chains were found to be identical in both oxidized and reduced forms. A possible explanation could be the slight conformation change occurring in the His101 backbone, observed by a close inspection of the NMR structures (see above and Supporting Information Figure S3). Indeed, in the reduced state, the His101 amide NH bond is relatively exposed to solvent and globally lies on the same side as its imidazole side chain, in all 20 representative structures. In contrast, in the oxidized state, this NH bond seems to reorient, in all structures, by pointing inside of the protein, i.e., opposite to the N H of the His101 side chain. Therefore, the His101 NH group in the oxidized state might

variations of backbone carbonyl and amide groups between the two redox states. As for the dynamic properties, the analysis of Lipari-Szabo mobility parameters showed, in both redox states, relatively high order parameter around the active site as well as the presence of conformational exchange for a few residues. However, these results did not allow to analyze thoroughly the redox changes in the active site, as several residues could not be fitted in this region. Moreover, the observed perturbations could not be considered as significant, given the several assumptions made in the Lipari-Szabo analysis and the general offset of 0.02 for the average order parameter observed between the two redox states, which might originate from the uncertainty in the diffusion tensor determination. The spectral density mapping, which uses the relaxation parameters without any dynamic or structural model hypothesis, could be performed on all residues of the active site, except prolines, and appeared to give complementary valuable information and to be a more suitable method to detect dynamic variations. Indeed, in both redox forms, the J(H) values are relatively low or close to the average, all around the active site, except for residue Gln76 which has a slightly decreased order parameter of 0.91. This indicates that this whole region, including the residues that were rejected from the model-free analysis, has very restricted flexibility in the fast time scale. Nevertheless, relatively large Jeff(0) values were observed for many residues in the segment Leu69-Gly75, especially in the oxidized form, suggesting the presence of slow movements in the µs-ms range affecting a large part of the active site. The differences of spectral density values between the redox states interestingly show that motions in the slow time scale around the active site are slightly increased in the oxidized state compared to the reduced state (Jeff(0) > 0), while those in a faster time scale are decreased (J(N) < 0). The Structure of the FLHE Loop. In NterPilBred and NterPilBox NMR solution structures, the FLHE residues are shaped in a well-structured loop internally stabilized by a hydrogen bond between Phe99 and Glu102. Moreover, a hydrogen bond involving backbone NH group of Ser65 and side chain of Glu102 promotes the global positioning of this four-residue segment. The rmsd values between the NMR solution and X-ray structures of NterPilBred are respectively 0.31 and 1.35 Å for the backbone and the heavy atoms of

NMR Structure and Dynamics of NterPilB be less affected by the occurring protonation/deprotonation process at its side chain than in the reduced state. Finally, the relaxation study detects no large conformational exchange in the FLHE loop in both redox forms, since the exchange term observed for His101 was shown to reflect mostly a proton exchange at the histidine side chain. As for the active site, the spectral density mapping appeared to be useful to complement the dynamics analysis in the FLHE loop, since it could be performed on all residues and could not be biased by any model assumptions. Rather low J(H) values indicative of very restricted flexibility are obtained in the whole loop. Particularly high Jeff(0) values are observed only for His101, which is affected by the proton exchange at its side chain, as discussed above. The spectral density mapping therefore confirms that the FLHE loop is globally rigid in both redox states. However, the differences of spectral density values between the oxidized and the reduced forms highlight significant variations of J(N) and J(H) in this loop, indicating dynamic perturbations on the fast time scale. Finally, together with the subtle conformational changes observed between the two redox states, dynamics results demonstrate the presence of small but significant perturbations upon redox change. Interestingly, the additional Arg71-Asp77 segment of YkuV that corresponds in NterPilB to the Phe99-Asp105 segment holding the additional FLHE loop (Figure 8a) is equally well structured in the reduced and the oxidized forms of YkuV (backbone rmsd values of 0.47 ( 0.20 and 0.44 ( 0.16 Å, respectively). Nonetheless, the conformation of this segment is clearly different in YkuV and in NterPilB. The protrusion formed by this segment points toward the active site in NterPilB (Figure 8b), while it rather stretches along the -strand axis and points toward the solvent (Figure 8c) in YkuV. From the simple docking-calculated model of YkuV complexed with ArsC from B. subtilis, this loop seems to be close to the interaction interface. However, as observed for the FLHE loop of NterPilB, no particular dynamics data have been reported for the RSED loop of YkuV (16). This may suggest that a well-structured segment which does not exhibit large internal motions in the unbound state of the protein could possibly be involved during the binding step with a biological partner. The orientation of this segment relative to the active site may be then a sufficient element to generate the substrate specificity. Functional Consequences of the CMP Topology and of the Presence of the FLHE Loop. NterPilB is a periplasmic disulfide oxidoreductase belonging to the Trx-like family but with a CMP topology. As E. coli reduced Trx1, it is able to regenerate the reduced forms of the Msr domains of PilB from their oxidized forms. But, in constrast to E. coli Trx1, (i) NterPilBox is not reduced by the E. coli Trx reductase (5), and (ii) NterPilBred does not regenerate the E. coli reduced forms of MsrA and MsrB from their oxidized forms (data not shown). Compared to CMPs, one edge of the active site is covered by the specific FLHE loop. Our results show that the reduced and the oxidized forms of NterPilB have in common a few flexible regions. Significant differences in the dihedral angle values upon the redox process of NterPilB are observed for Cys67, Cys70, and neighboring residues (Ala64 and Trp66), as well as for particular residues located in the 2-R3 and 5-R5 loops, that denote a rearranging of some segments near the active site. In particular, the large

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 33, 2008 8587 values of (Leu100) and (His101) (Supporting Information Figure S1) attest the rearranging of the Leu100His101 bond and the reorientation of the His101-NH. However, the FLHE loop keeps very restricted fast time scale motions and experiences no large conformational exchange in both states. These results raise the question of the role of the specific FLHE loop. Two hypotheses can be advanced both as a discriminating factor in the recognition of either its periplasmic recycling partner or the oxidized Msr domains within the PilB protein. The recycling partner of NterPilBox is probably the N-terminal domain of DsbD (nDsbD). Indeed, the nDsbD from E. coli was shown to be able to reduce NterPilBox from N. gonorrheae (7). Recently, our group purified the nDsbD domain from N. meningitidis and showed that it efficiently reduces in Vitro NterPilBox from N. meningitidis with a k2 value of 6 × 105 M-1 s-1 (Selme et al., unpublished results). The nDsbD domain of E. coli presents an immunoglobulinlike fold and is known to efficiently recycle three periplasmic Trx-like proteins (48). These proteins are involved either in the periplasmic disulfide isomerization or in the cytochrome c maturation systems, all of them lacking the FLHE loop. These data strongly suggest that the FLHE loop is not a discriminating factor for the interaction with the nDsbD. This is confirmed by the fact that the N. meningitidis DsbE, which has been recently purified and characterized by our group, is efficiently reduced by the nDsbD domain with a k2 value in the range of that determined for the NterPilB domain (Gand et al., unpublished results). An alternative role of this loop would be to promote a selective interaction between the NterPilB domain and the oxidized Msr domains within the PilB protein. This is probably the case. Indeed, the NterPilB domain has been previously shown to reduce efficiently the isolated MsrB domain of PilB (5),4 while recent results from our group have demonstrated that the N. meningitidis DsbE is unable to reduce the isolated oxidized MsrB domain of PilB (Selme et al., unpublished results). In that context, the knowledge of the structure of a complex between NterPilB and the MsrB domain of PilB, linked by a mixed disulfide bond, could allow fine analyses of the interactions between both partners and, in particular, of the role of the FLHE loop. An enzymatic characterization of a truncated form of NterPilB deleted from the FLHE loop would be also informative.

4 Previous kinetic studies on the soluble domains of PilB have shown that the NterPilB is able to reduce efficiently the MsrB domain but not the MsrA one (5). This latter result is probably due to the fact that the activity was tested on an isolated domain but not on the entire PilB protein. Indeed Brot et al. (7) have shown, in the full-length protein context, the absence of a preference for the NerPilB from N. gonorrheae to reduce one Msr domain over the second one (7).

shift perturbations of the 13C CO backbone groups calculated between the reduced and the oxidized form of NterPilB. The dotted line corresponds to the value of the mean perturbation plus two standard deviations. The measures were done at 600 MHz, 298 K, and pH 7.0 for the two forms. Figure S3 shows the structure close-up of NterPilB around His101. The 20 representative structures of the reduced (blue) and the oxidized (red) state are displayed after backbone superimposition (from Thr39 to Asp170 residues). The backbone amide HN and the side-chain N H bonds of His101 are represented in thick lines. This material is available free of charge via the Internet at http://pubs.acs.org. REFERENCES
