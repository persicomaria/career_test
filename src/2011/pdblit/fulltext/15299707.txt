Abstract

The three-dimensional structures of two cytochromes c' have been determined in order to analyse the common features of proteins of this family and their relationship with other four-helix bundle structures. The structure of cytochrome c' from Alcaligenes sp was determined by molecular replacement supplemented with the iron anomalous scattering and the use of a single isomorphous heavy-atom derivative, and was refined using synchrotron data to 1.8 A resolution. The final model, comprising 956 protein atoms (one monomer) and 89 water molecules, has a final R value of 0.188 for all data in the range 20.0-1.8 ,~ resolution (14673 reflections). The structure of the cytochrome c' from Alcaligenes denitrificans is isomorphous and essentially identical (r.m.s. deviation for all atoms 0.36A). Although its amino-acid sequence has not been determined chemically, only four differences from that of Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c' were identified by the X-ray analysis. The final model for Alcaligenes denitrificans cytochrome c', comprising 953 protein atoms and 75 water molecules, gave a final R factor of 0.167 for all data in the range 20.0-2.15~, (8220 reflections). The cytochrome c' monomer forms a classic four-helix bundle, determined by the packing of hydrophobic side chains around the enclosed haem group. There are very few cross-linking hydrogen bonds between the helices, the principal sidechain hydrogen bonding involving one of the haem propionates and a conserved Arg residue. The cytochrome c' dimer is created by a crystallographic twofold axis. Monomer-monomer contacts primarily involve the two A helices, with size complementarity of side chains in a central solvent-excluded portion of the interface and hydrogen bonding at the periphery. Both species have a pyroglutamic acid N-terminal residue. The haem iron is five-coordinate, 0.32 A out of the haem plane towards the fifth ligand, Hisl20. The unusual magnetic properties of the Fe atom may be linked to a conserved basic residue, Arg 124, adjacent to His 120.

1. Introduction

Cytochrome c' is a small c-type cytochrome which is found in a variety of photosynthetic and denitrifying bacteria (Bartsch, 1978). In several respects, the :~1996 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved

cytochromes c' bear a superficial resemblance to the proteins of the mitochondrial cytochrome c class; they have a polypeptide of 120-130 amino-acid residues (approximately 14kDa) and the single protohaem IX group is attached through two Cys-thioether linkages provided by the common Cys-X-Y-Cys-His motif. Apart from these parallels, however, the cytochromes c' have many unique features, and their structural and physical properties mark them out as a distinct protein family. The cytochromes c' are usually isolated as soluble homodimers (2 × 14 kDa), although several species also undergo an unusual ligand-controlled dimer dissociation (Cusanovich & Gibson, 1973; Kassner, 1991). The CysX-Y-Cys-His motif through which the haem is attached is close to the C-terminus of each polypeptide (in contrast to the mitochondrial cytochromes c where it is near the N-terminus). The His residue in this sequence motif also provides a fifth ligand for the Fe atom, but another unique feature of the cytochromes c' is the absence of any sixth ligand provided by the protein. Instead, they have the property of being able to bind certain small, neutral ligands such as CO and NO (but not 02) at the vacant coordination site (Gibson & Kamen, 1966; Doyle, Weber & Gill, 1985). Their spectroscopic properties are also marked by an unusual mixed spin state of the Fe atom (Maltempo, Moss & Cusanovich, 1974) which has been attributed to the relatively weak ligand field provided by the five-coordinate site (Weber, 1982). Although found in a wide variety of bacteria the actual functional role of cytochromes c' is not clear (Meyer & Kamen, 1982). Their physicochemical properties suggest a role in electren transfer, perhaps in denitrifying pathways, given their distribution. It is also not known whether their ability to bind species such as CO and NO has any physiological significance. Structurally, the cytochromes c' are of considerable interest. Crystallographic analyses of the cytochromes c' from three different bacterial species have established that they have a classic four-helix bundle fold; the structures determined to date include the cytochromes c' from Rhodospirillum molischianum, at 1.67 A resolution (Weber, Howard, Xuong & Salemme, 1981; Finzel, Weber, Hardman & Salemme, 1985); from Chromatium vinosum, at 1.8,~, resolution (Ren, Meyer & McRee, 1993); and from Rhodospirillum rubrum, at 2.8,~, resolution (Yasui, Harada, Kai, Kasai, Kusunoki &

A. J. DOBBS, B. F. ANDERSON, H. R. FABER AND E. N. BAKER Matsuura, 1992). A striking feature of the cytochrome c' family is, however, the relatively low level of sequence conservation among its members (Ambler et al., 1981). Pairwise sequence comparisons show only 25-30% identity, and very few residues are conserved through the family as a whole. The structural constraints (or relative lack of them) within the cytochrome c' family are thus of considerable relevance to current interest in the de novo design of proteins. Many of these studies are directed towards the design of proteins with a four-helix bundle fold (Ho & De Grado, 1987; Regan & De Grado, 1988; Hecht, Richardson, Richardson & Ogden, 1990) and the ways in which this fold can be varied and stabilized are thus of much interest. Furthermore, the haem in cytochrome c' occupies a cleft at one end of the four-helix bundle, formed by the splaying outwards of the helices; this feature, too, has been utilized in attempts to incorporate a particular active site into a designed molecule of this type (Hahn, Klis & Stewart, 1990). Here we describe high-resolution crystal structures for two closely related cytochromes c', from Alcaligenes sp and Alcaligenes denitrificans. An earlier report described attempts to overcome the difficulties posed by the low similarity of available search models for the use of molecular replacement in the structure determination (Baker, Anderson, Dobbs & Dodson, 1995). Here the completion of the structure analysis and the details of the refined structure are presented, together with an analysis of the similarities and differences between these structures and the others determined to date; this is aimed at establishing the common structural framework of the cytochrome c ' family, including the stabilization of haem binding, and the relevance to other four-helix bundle proteins.

(0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer, 90% saturated with ammonium sulfate, at pH 8.0) in which were dissolved small concentrations (1-10mM) of various heavy-atom reagents. The small number of cytochrome c' crystals available limited these experiments, which were carried out on the Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c', and only one derivative was found that gave suitable intensity changes without disrupting the crystals. This derivative was with K2PtCI 4 at a concentration of 1 mM and a soaking time of ld. 2.2. Data collection The earlier molecular-replacement analysis of the two cytochromes c' used two sets of intensity data, a 2.8,~ native data set for Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c', collected at room temperature on a Xuong-Hamlin multiwire area detector ( C u K a , Rigaku RU200 rotating-anode generator), and a 1.86A native data set for Alcaligenes denitrificans cytochrome c' collected at room temperature, from a single crystal, on a Rigaku R-AXIS IIC image-plate detector (CuKot, Rigaku RU200 rotating-anode generator). The full details of data collection are as reported earlier (Baker et al., 1995), but the statistics are also summarized in Table 1. In the case of the Alcaligenes denitrificans data set the completeness at the highest resolution was low, and for refinement the effective resolution was judged to be 2.15 ,~, at which resolution the overall completeness was 90%. For the completion of the structure analysis, described herein, two additional data sets were collected; a native data set to 1.8,~, resolution for Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c' and a data set for the K2PtCI 4 derivative of the sameoPrOtein (see also Table 1). The 1.8 A native data set for Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c' was collected at 283 K using the synchrotron radiation source of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). Intensity data were measured by screenless Weissenberg photography, with image plates (Sakabe, 1991), using an X-ray source of wavelength 1.0A. Two crystals were used; one oriented along the unique [c] axis was used to collect data over a rotation range of 60 ~', and the second, oriented along the [a] axis gave data over a rotation range of 90"'. Total exposure time was 65 min for crystal l and 84min for crystal 2. Data were processed using the

2.1. Crystals and heavy-atom derivatives
Cytochrome c' was isolated from cultures of Alcaligenes sp (NCIB 11015, formerly known as Pseudomonas denitrificans and now also known as Achromobacter xylosoxidans) and Alcaligenes denitrificans (NCTC 8582) and crystallized in its oxidized, Fe III, form as previously described (Norris, Anderson, Baker & Rumball, 1979). The crystals are isomoorphous, with cell dimensions a = b = 5 4 . 4 , c=181.1A, a=/3=90, ?' = 120 ° (Alcaligenes sp) and a = b = 54.6, c = 180.4 A, c~ = / 3 = 90, y = 120 ° (Alcaligenes denitrificans), space group P6122 or P6522, with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The space group was subsequently determined to be P6522 from the structure analysis by molecular replacement and anomalous scattering methods (Baker et al., 1995). Attempts to prepare heavy-atom derivatives were made by soaking the crystals in standard mother liquor

2.3. Structure determination Earlier attempts to solve the structures of either Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c' or Alcaligenes denitrifcans cytochrome c' by molecular replacement had been made difficult by the low degree of similarity of the available search models. In the end, the phase information from the iron anomalous scattering, combined from both structures, together with considerations of monomer association into dimers, proved sufficient to identify the correct molecular-replacement solution (Baker et al., 1995). An electron-density map phased solely by the iron anomalous scattering (with solvent flattening) allowed some rebuilding of the structure and initial refinement, but the inter-helix connecting loops could not be traced satisfactorily and refinement was held up at R = 0.280.30. The use of calculated phases from the model, or calculated phases combined with anomalous phases, also failed to reveal the missing structure. It was for this reason that the single isomorphous derivative was used, to provide additional phasing. The data for the K2PtCI 4 derivative were scaled to the native Alcaligenes sp data, giving a mean isomorphous difference of 15.1%, and a difference Patterson map was interpretable in terms of one major site of substitution and one minor site. Details are given in Table 2. The major binding site of the heavy atom later proved to be the side chain of His l20. Heavy-atom parameters (x, y, z, B and occupancy) were refined with MLPHARE (Otwinowski, 1991), and a single isomorphous replacement (SIR) phase determination gave a mean overall figure of merit of 0.44 for all data in the resolution range 20.0-3.0A. A subsequent SIR-phased electron-density map correlated well with the electron-density map phased by the iron anomalous scattering (correlation coefficient 0.32) and was of similar quality; it confirmed the original molecular-replacement solution but failed to give better definition to the inter-helix connecting loops. Use of solvent flattening, with SQUASH (Cowtan & Main, 1993) or Wang's method (Wang, 1985) increased the figure of merit, but did not improve the electrondensity map sufficiently to trace the missing structure. Attempts to combine the SIR phases with the iron anomalous phases were made difficult by the lack of suitable weights for the latter, because of the way they were obtained (Baker et al., 1995).

An electron-density map from which the missing structure (primarily the inter-helix loops, but also some side chains) could be located and built was finally obtained by carrying out point-by-point additions of the independently phased maps, using the program OVERLAPMAP (CCP4, Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The SIR and iron anomalous maps were combined (correlation coefficient 0.20), as were the Wang phase-extended map and the iron anomalous map (correlation coefficient 0.17); these two combined maps were then themselves combined. The electron-density map that resulted from this combination of maps, at a resolution of 3.0A, finally allowed the inter-helix loops to be unequivocally traced, and several incorrectly built parts of the helices to be improved. Refinement then became straightforward. 2.4. Refinement The initial model for Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c' was the molecular-replacement model, derived from the Rhodospirillum molischianum cytochrome c' model, with some rebuilding into the iron anomalous-phased electron-density map (Baker et al., 1995). From this model, residues 33-38, 52-78 and 98-104 (the interhelix connecting loops) were removed, together with a number of amino-acid side chains. These were reincluded in the model by rebuilding into the combined maps described above, using the program FRODO (Jones, 1978), as the density became clearer during refinement. The course of the refinement using the 1.8 A, Photon Factory data set throughout, is outlined in Table 3. Initial refinement was with X-PLOR 3.1 (Brtinger, 1992), using the simulated-annealing protocols of Briinger, Kuriyan & Karplus (1987). The free R value was also monitored during this stage to check that real progress was being made. At the end of this phase of refinement the crystallographic R factor was 0.221 (free R = 0.275) for data in the resolution range 5.0-1.8 A. Refinement was then continued with the restrained least-squares program TNT (Tronrud, Ten Eyck & Matthews, 1987). Restraints were placed on bond lengths, bond angles, planar groups, non-bonded contacts and temperature factors of neighbouring atoms; no correction for the solvent continuum was made. Omit maps were calculated at regular intervals to allow manual rebuilding of regions, with regions needing attention often being identified by their high B values. Solvent molecules (all regarded as water) were added conservatively with due regard for their environment including potential interactions with hydrogenbond partners. The solvent model was comprehensively checked several times during refinement by omitting all water molecules that had high B values (>60,~2), or made either too-close contacts with each other or with protein atoms, or made no potential hydrogen-bonded contacts at all.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Model quality
Both refined models give extremely good agreement with the X-ray data, the final values for the crystallographic R factor being, for Alcaligene~" sp, 0.188 for all data in the resolution range 20.0-1.8A (14673 reflections, with no o- cutoff) and, for Alcaligenes denitrificans, 0.167 for all data in the range 20.0-2.15A (8220 reflections, with no cs cutoff). Luzzati plots (Luzzati, 1952) of the R factor as a function of resolution (Fig. 1) are consistent with average maximum coordinate errors of approximately 0.18 A for both structures; a SIGMAA analysis (Read, 1986) gives similar values of about 0.16A. Both models conform with expected geometry; root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviations from standard bond lengths and angles are 0.017 A and 2.4 °, respectively, for Alcaligenes sp, and 0.013A and 2.1 ° for Alcaligenes denitrificans. A Ramachandran plot (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) of main-chain torsion angles (~v, ~) for Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c' is shown in Fig. 2, and is representative of both structures. There are no outliers, and 96% of residues fall into the 'most favoured' regions defined in the program PROCHECK (Laskowski, MacArthur, Moss & Thornton, 1993). The entire polypeptide chain of Alcaligenes sp is represented by well defined electron density except for the two C-terminal residues, 126 and 127, which are missing from our final model. The amino-acid sequence for "Alcaligenes denitrificans cytochrome c' has not been determined chemically, but in our model comprises residues 1-125, as for Alcaligenes sp. Several representative views of the final electron density are shown in Fig. 3. The N-terminal residue is in both cases pyroglutamic acid, with the side-chain carboxyl group covalently linked to the N-terminal or-amino group to give a cyclic structure, which is extremely clear in the electron density (Fig. 3c). Even the inter-helix connecting loops, which had proved so difficult to model originally, are now well defined (Fig. 3b); evidently the difficulties arose from inadequacies in the original phasing and from the structural differences in these regions from the molecular-replacement search models, rather than from a lack of definition in the structure. Very few of the 13 Lys residues are involved in stabilizing interactions (see later) and many of these side chains are

Once the Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c', for which the amino-acid sequence was known (Ambler, 1973), had been refined, this refined model was used as starting model for refinement of the Alcaligenes denitrificans structure. This was expected to be appropriate because of the high degree of isomorphism between the two. Since no sequence is yet available for Alcaligenes denitrificans cytochrome c' electron-density maps were carefully scrutinized for indications of sequence differences, and where there was any doubt the side chain was cut back or removed completely. Refinement began with three rounds of rigid-body refinement using TNT. The molecule was split into eight rigid-body groups (four helices, three connecting loops and the haem) and the maximum resolution was extended from 3.0 to 2.0 A in steps during the three rounds of refinement. Little movement occurred, and the groups were easily rejoined by building into an omit map. Conventional restrained least-squares refinement, with TNT, was then continued, and solvent molecules added as before. The final refined model for Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c' comprises 956 protein atoms (one monomer; 125 residues and a haem group) and 89 water molecules. That for Alcaligenes denitrificans comprises 953 protein

A. J. DOBBS, B. F. ANDERSON, H. R. FABER AND E. N. BAKER poorly ordered; in the final model for Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c' the side chains of Lys4, Lys31, Lys41, Lys49, Lys 104 and Lys 117 are incomplete. 3.2. Overall structure The cytochrome c' monomers for both Alcaligenes sp and Alcaligenes denitrificans have the expected fourhelix bundle structures, described in detail below. In both cases the functional dimer is created by a crystallographic twofold axis; the symmetry operation which relates the monomer coordinates to the other half of the dimer is y - x , y, I __ Z). In keeping with the close isomorphism of the crystals and the apparently very high level of identity of the two sequences (see below), the three-dimensional structures of the two species of cytochrome c' are extremely similar. When the Alcaligenes sp and Alcaligenes denitrificans structures are superimposed, the r.m.s. deviation is 0.17,~, for C,~ atoms and 0.36,~ for all atoms. This is in spite of the fact that the starting model for refinement with the Alcaligenes denitrificans data (which was the final refined model for Alcaligenes sp) was first subjected to rigid-body refinement in which the structure was broken up into eight groups, allowing ample scope for readjustment. 3.3. Amino-acid sequence The crystallographic refinement has confirmed the published amino-acid sequence of Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c' (Ambler, 1973), including the blocked N-terminus (Fig. 3c). In the Alcaligenes denitrificans structure only four sequence differences have been detected; Thr27 is modelled as Aia, Pro61 as Ala, Ser78 as Giy and Ala122 as Ser. All of these positions are highly variable in other cytochrome c' sequences. Of course, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that some of these side chains could be longer, but disordered; residues 4, 31, 41, 49, 104 and 117 are again modelled as incomplete Lys residues. Moreover, even at the relatively high resolution of the present structure analysis some side chains simply cannot be distinguished from the X-ray data alone. Nevertheless, it seems certain that the sequence identity must be greater than 90%, consistent with the high isomorphism of the two crystal structures. 3.4. The four-helix bundle The four helices, labelled A to D, form a classic fourhelix bundle, and account for almost all of the secondary structure in the cytochrome c' monomer (Table 4). At the top of the molecule, in the orientation shown in Fig. 4, the helices are joined by very short loops; the A-B loop comprises only five residues (33-37), and the C-D connection can hardly be described as a loop at all, since

G l y l 0 0 is the last residue of helix C and Aspl01 the first of helix D. At the bottom of the molecule, however, the B-C loop is long (21 residues) and helps to provide some of the packing round the haem (see below). This combination of short loops at one end, and a long loop at the other end, is associated with the splaying out of the helices to create a haem-binding crevice at the wider end. The four helices contain a number of features that are commonly found in globular proteins (Baker & Hubbard, 1984). Helix A begins with an Oty configuration, with two 1-4 hydrogen bonds, 4 0 . . . 7 N and 50--.8N, and terminates with an otc2 configuration, marked by 1-6, 2-5 hydrogen bonding ( 2 8 0 . . . 3 3 N , 2 9 0 . . . 3 2 N ) and a residue (Gly32) with the left-handed c~ configuration. It also has a distinct kink, caused by the presence of Pro28, which bends the helix through an angle of 30 ~ and results in the loss of four hydrogen bonds (the C z O groups of residues 22-25 are not involved in intrahelicai hydrogen bonding). Both helix B and helix C tighten towards 1-4 hydrogen bonding near their C-termini, this being another characteristic termination mode, labelled o~c~ by Baker & Hubbard (1984). Apart from the changed hydrogen-bonding patterns at their N- and C-termini, and the Pro-associated kink in helix A, the four helices are remarkably regular. The 1-5 hydrogen-bond lengths are extremely consistent. The plot in Fig. 5 suggests that there are slight bends in helix

CYTOCHROME C' sequence (Baker & Hubbard, 1984; Gray & Matthews, 1984); Serl4, Thrl7, Arg25, Thr27, Thr50, Thr52, Trp56, Thr63, Ser74 and Asn89 all form local hydrogen bonds of this type. Only seven side chains make longer range, crosslinking interactions within the cytochrome c' monomer. Probably the most important of these are the network of hydrogen bonds linking Arg 12, on helix A, to the haem D ring propionate and to the B-C loop. The full hydrogenbonding potential of the guanidinium group is used, with NE hydrogen bonded to the propionate O atom, OlD, NH1 hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl O atoms of residues 58 and 63 and Thr63 OG 1, all on the B-C loop, and NH2 hydrogen bonded to 63 O and 65 O, both also from the B--C loop (see Fig. 6). Glnl3, adjacent to Argl2 on helix A, also hydrogen bonds to the D ring propionate. The only other cross-linking hydrogen bonds involve Asn44 on helix B, which interacts with His22 on helix A (OD1. · .22 ND1; ND2.. -22 O); Thr63 on the B-C loop, which interacts with Argl2 on helix A (OG1... 12 NH2); Trp73, which helps stabilize the conformation of the B-C loop (NE1. · .600); and Lys92 on helix C and Aspl 11 on helix D which form a salt bridge linking the two helices. 3.6. The haem environment The principal determinant of the cytochrome c' structure appears to be the packing of the helix bundle around the haem; the helices, together with the long B-C loop, provide more than 20 side chains that pack against, or interact with, the haem group (see Table 5). Only three of the helices, A, C and D are directly involved, however, and the lack of involvement of helix B may correlate with its lesser spatial conservation among cytochrome c' structures (see later). Thus helix A provides, from its first five turns, Val9, Argl2 and Glnl3, Leul6 and Thrl7, Metl9 and Ala20, and Phe23; helix C provides, from its first three turns, Phe79, Lys82 and Gln83, and Phe86; and helix D provides, from its last three turns, the

B, at around residue 45, and in helix D around residues 117 and 120, the latter two associated with haem binding; apart from these the average hydrogen-bond length is 2.97(0.13),~. Similar regularity, with low standard deviations is found, in the (~0, ~p) angles, which average [63.2 (6.2) °, 40.2 (8.1)°] over the four helices (78 residues, omitting only the termini and the kink in helix A). One other feature of the helices deserves comment. Each of them has a negatively charged residue at its Nterminus, presumably adding stabilization by interaction with the positive charge of the helix N-terminus (Hol, van Duijnen & Berendsen, 1978; Nicholson, Becktel & Matthews, 1988). Helix A has Glu6, which hydrogen bonds with its own peptide NH, and Asp7, which hydrogen bonds with the peptide NH of residue 4, helix B has Asp37, which hydrogen bonds with the peptide NH of residue 40, and helix D has Aspl01 which hydrogen bonds with the peptide NH of residue 104; these are all typical 'N-cap' hydrogen-bonding interactions, side chain n . . . N H ( n - 3 ) or n...NH(n + 3 ) (Baker & Hubbard, 1984; Richardson & Richardson, 1988; Presta & Rose, 1988). Helix C has Asp75 at its Nterminus and although the carboxyl group does not make a geometrically favourable hydrogen bond, mutagenesis of other systems has shown that the charge interaction is the more important effect (Nicholson et al., 1988). Apart from the four helices the only other secondarystructural elements are found in the long B-C loop. This loop is quite tightly organized, beginning with a short 3~0-helix (55-59), followed by two/3-turns both of which contribute to interactions with the haem group (see later) and finishing with another short helix (69-75) which is intermediate in character between 3]0 and or. 3.5. Side-chain hydrogen bonding Very few of the side chains in the cytochrome c' structure are involved in hydrogen bonds or ion pairs. Of those that are, most form local interactions, with residues close in the amino-acid sequence. This can be attributed to the high helical content, which favours the formation of hydrogen bonds in which a side chain interacts with a carbonyl O atom three or four residues earlier in the

CYTOCHROME C' bundle of helices A, A', B, B' (Weber et al., 1981). In the two Alcaligenes cytochromes c' the major part of the dimer interface lies between Tyrl 1 and His22 of helix A and Va147 and Leu54 of helixB. At the two ends of this region are strong hydrogen bonds between the side chains of T y r l l and His22 ( l l O H . . . 2 2 ' N E 2 and 22 NE2...1 I'OH). In between these residues solvent is totally excluded and the monomer-monomer interactions are primarily hydrophobic and marked by shape complementarity of the two surfaces. The clearest example of this involves Leul8, which packs between Tyrl l' and Leul 8' of the opposing monomer and fits into a hole created by the presence of a small side chain (Ala) at position 15' (i.e. on the intervening turn of helix). This is shown schematically in Fig. 9. Outside this central, solvent-excluded region the N-terminus of the polypeptide chain folds back such that it interacts with helix A of its own monomer (Phe2 packs against Ala8 and the aromatic ring of Tyrl 1) and helix A' of the opposing monomer (the N-terminal pyroglutamic acid side chain packs against the side chain of Arg25'). A number of well defined water molecules are found in this region of the interface. In general, most of the monomer-monomer contacts involve helix A, as is shown in Table 7, although Va147, Leu51 and Leu54 of helix B do contribute significantly to the central hydrophobic core of the interface. 3.9. Temperature factors The cytochrome c ' molecule as a whole is tightly organized and well ordered and this is reflected in the atomic B factors. The average B factor for main-chain atoms is 16.7 ~2 for the Alcaligenes sp structure and a plot of the variation of B factors along the polypeptide chain (Fig. 10) shows that even the connecting loops between helices have relatively low values; only at positions 60--64 in the B - C loop, 74-80 at the start of helix C, 97-100 at the end of helix C and at the polypeptide chain N- and C-termini do the main-chain B factors rise above 20,~2.

(away from the His ligand), and the B and D rings tilted up. The amino acid that occupies the site distal to the Fe atom, Leul6, makes a closest approach of 3.5 A to the centre of the haem group, too close to allow a solvent molecule to bind in the axial sixth coordination position. The possible significance of this is discussed below. 3.8. The dimer interface As in the other cytochrome c ' structures, the dimer is created by the association of helices A and B of one molecule with the corresponding helices A' and B' of a second molecule. The twofold axis relating the two monomers then gives rise to an antiparallel four-helix

Main-chain B values are shown by the solid line trace (indicating the average value for N, C,,, C, O for each residue) and average side-chain values are indicated by the vertical lines. The extent of a - h e l i c e s and 3H~-helices are shown with solid and open horizontal bars respectively.

In spite of their folding similarities the cytochrome c' structures do not superimpose particularly well in three dimensions. The overall structural superposition of Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c' on to the other two highresolution structures, those from R. molischianum (Finzel et al., 1985) and C. vinosum (Ren et al., 1993), is summarized in Fig. 11. In constrtlcting the structural alignment, helices A and D, which show moderate sequence identity between species (Fig. 12), were used together with the haem to give an initial superposition, which could then be extended to the other two helices and finally to the connecting loops. The closest similarity is between Alcaligenes sp and C. vinosum structures, which match with an r.m.s, deviation of 1.37,~, for 113 C,~ atoms (1.07 ,~ for 75 C,~ if only the four helices, without their C-terminal residues, are included). Agreement is worse between Alcaligenes sp cytochrome c' and the two structures used in our molecular-replacement calculations (Baker et al., 1995), i.e. those from R. molischianum and R. rubrum; r.m.s, deviations of 1.94 ,~ (109C,~) and 2.07,~, (108C,~), respectively, or 1.44,~, (75 C,~) and 1.56 ,~, (75 C,,) if only the u-helices are used. This undoubtedly accounted for some of the difficulties encountered in the molecular-replacement analysis. The individual helices vary in their structural correspondence. If the molecules are superimposed as a whole, and the contribution of each helix is then dissected out, it can be seen that helices A and D match the best (Table 8). These are the two helices most closely associated with the haem, D through its three covalent linkages and A through its predominance in non-bonded contacts (Table 5); this makes the point that it is the packing of these helices against the haem that defines the core of the structure. Helix B matches least well and this is the helix which makes the fewest contacts with the haem. It is also involved in the generation of the dimer interface and it seems probable that the variations in the orientation of helix B are a major factor in the variations in the mode of association of the two monomers (Yasui et al., 1992). The sequence alignment based on structural correspondence (Fig. 12) shows few identical residues, only 12 ('~10%) being totally invariant across the four species. Of these C y s l l 6 , C y s l l 9 and His120 are involved in covalent links to the haem, Argl2 provides a network of internal hydrogen bonds, to the haem D

366

CYTOCHROME C' The distribution of residues at the remaining positions b, c, e, f, g shows that alanine residues, which presumably help to favour helix formation, given their propensity to appear in helices, are scattered liberally through all these sites. As regards larger hydrophobic residues, however, five are found in positions c and g of helices A and B (Leul8, Va129, Va147, Leu51, Leu54) and all except Va129 are involved in the dimer interface; only one other such residue (Val91) is found anywhere else round the four helices. Thus, the distribution of hydrophobic residues outside the core a and d positions creates a surface patch that strongly favours dimerization through helices A and B (see Fig. 13). It is not known whether dimerization has any functional significance, but it seems unlikely that it plays any role in stabilization of the basic four-helix bundle structure. Although there are numerous charged residues in the external positions, b, c, e, f, g (five Asp, one Glu, eight Lys, two Arg) ion pairs are almost non-existent; there is just a single inter-helical one, Lys92-Aspl 11 (c-c), and no intrahelical ion pairs. Thus, specific ionic interactions do not seem to play any part in assembling the four-helix bundle. As suggested by Cohen & Parry (1990) the internal hydrophobic interactions and the influence of the dipolar nature of o~-helices must be sufficient to drive the antiparaUel packing of the helices and the formation of the four-helix bundle. The almost complete absence of cross-linking hydrogen bonds further strengthens this conclusion.

propionate and to the B-C loop, and Gly62 and Thr63 are on a conserved turn that interacts with Argl2. The others are two glycines, 100 and 113, Pro5 at the Nterminus of helix A, two internal residues on helix C, Leu93 and Ala97, and Lys117. Although within the haem-binding CxxCH sequence motif it is difficult to see why Lys117 should be conserved as it projects into the external solution and does not interact with any other protein atoms. The lack of sequence identity between cytochromes c' can be traced to the four-helix bundle fold. This is defined by the interactions of hydrophobic residues, with each other and with the haem; almost all remain hydrophobic but there are evidently many combinations of such side chains that give similar packing and the same fold. Thus, almost none of the internal hydrophobic side chains are conserved because their interactions are not geometrically specific. A second feature of the fourhelix bundle fold, at least in cytochromes c', is the lack of cross-linking hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen-bonded side chains, because of their more specific geometrical requirements, tend to be more highly conserved in homologous proteins. In cytochrome c' the vast majority of polar side chains either project into the external solvent or make local interactions, and there is thus little pressure for absolute conservation of their identity.

3.11. Stabilization of the four-helix bundle
In many respects the cytochrome c' structure fits the design principles advanced for the stabilization of fourhelix bundles (Ho & DeGrado, 1987; Cohen & Parry, 1990). The polypeptide N-terminus is blocked and, therefore, does not introduce repulsion with the Nterminus of the first helix. All four helices have N-caps, and in each case the residue is negatively charged, for maximum stabilization. The first three helices all terminate with Gly or Pro residues. Most importantly, the distribution of hydrophobic residues in the helical wheel representation (Fig. 13) shows the role these play. All of the residues in positions a and d of the four helices are hydrophobic, with the exception of Arg 12 and Gin83. The hydrophobic residues, which include the two Cys residues that provide covalent linkages to the haem group, are used in packing between the haem and the helices, and between the helices themselves. At the top of the molecule (as in Fig. 4) residues from all four helices, Phe23 and Met26 (helix A), Val41, Va145 and Leu48 (helix B), Leu93 and Ala97 (helix C) and Leul05 and Phel09 (helix D) pack together. Lower down the bundle, where the haem slots in as the helices splay out, the packing is about the haem and between pairs of helices. Of the two non-hydrophobic residues, Argl2 forms important internal hydrogen bonds with one haem propionate group and with the B-C loop, but Gin83 is oriented such that its side-chain amide projects into solution.

3.12. Structural basis of iron spin state
The present structures suggest a reason for the unusual electronic properties of proteins of the cytochrome c' family. These proteins, in their oxidized, Fe H~, state, have EPR and magnetic properties that are best explained by an admixture of intermediate-spin (S = 3) and high-spin (S = ~ ) states (Maltempo, 1974; Maltempo et al., 1974). Theoretical considerations associate the intermediatespin state with a critical weakening of the axial ligand field strength (Weber, 1982), but there has been no clear structural explanation for this effect in cytochromes c'. The F e - - N bond lengths are normal, and the displacement of the Fe atom from the haem plane is not significantly less than in other five-coordinate haem proteins. Weber (1982) has suggested that the weaker hydrogen bonding of the His ligand, to a water molecule rather than to a carbonyl O atom, could in turn weaken its bonding to the Fe atom. In the two Alcaligenes cy~ochromes c' it is true that the His-bound water molecule is in each case poorly defined, with an elongated peak suggestive of positional disorder. The environment of the imidazole ring suggests another perturbing influence, however, in the presence of a positively charged residue, Arg124 in the present case, four residues (one turn of helix) removed from the His ligand. The guanidinium group of Arg124 interacts

B A K E R intimately with both the haem group and the His l20 imidazole ring (Fig. 7), the latter interactions resembling amino-aromatic hydrogen bonding (Burley & Petsko, 1986; Levitt & Perutz, 1988). The close interaction of this positively charged group with His120 must stabilize negative charge on the imidazole group substantially, and reduce its ability to denote electrons to the Fe atom. All

cytochromes c ' have a basic residue (Lys or Arg) in this position. Moreover the intermediate-spin state is pH dependent, with a change to pure high spin occurring at alkaline pH, the pK for this transition being between 7.1 and 9.0 (Bartsch, 1978). Thus we suggest that this pK may be associated with protonation of the residue (Arg or Lys) at position 124; the positively charged form, at
