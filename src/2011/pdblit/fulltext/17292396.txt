Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the VHSV G protein were compared in di#erent immunoassays and the variable domain cDNA sequences from the respective immunoglobulin (Ig) genes were determined. One MAb (IP1H3) was non-neutralising and recognised di#erent virus isolates equally well in ELISA. The other two were neutralising and recognised the same or closely related epitopes. One of these two MAbs (3F1H10) was more restricted in its ability to neutralise heterologous VHSV isolates than the other (3F1A2). A semi-quantitative relationship between binding of the two neutralising MAbs in ELISA and their neutralising activity was evident. Binding kinetic analyses by plasmon resonance identified di#erences in the dissociation rate constant (kd) as a possible explanation for the di#erent reactivity levels of the MAbs. The Ig variable heavy (VH) and light (V ) domain gene sequences of the three hybridomas were compared. The inferred amino acid sequence of the two neutralising antibody VH domains di#ered by three amino acid residues (97% identity) and only one residue di#erence was evident in the V domains. In contrast, IP1H3 shared only 38 and 39% identity with the 3F1A2 and 3F1H10 VH domains respectively and 49 and 50% identity with the 3F1A2 and 3F1H10 V domains respectively. The neutralising antibodies were produced by hybridomas originating from the same fusion and the high nucleotide sequence homology of the variable Ig gene regions indicated that the plasma cell partners of the hybridomas originated from the same virgin B lymphocyte. The few di#erences observed in the VH and V amino acid sequences were probably due to somatic mutations arising during a$nity maturation and might explain the observed reactivity di#erences between the two MAbs.

N. LORENZEN ET AL.

I. Introduction Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia is one of the most important diseases in farmed rainbow trout in Europe. The causal agent, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) is an enveloped negative strand RNA virus belonging to the rhabdovirus family (Lenoir & de Kinkelin, 1975). The viral glycoprotein (G protein) is the only protein known to be present on the surface of the virus particle and is the target of neutralising antibodies. In order to improve the understanding of protective immune mechanisms, knowledge of how neutralising antibodies interact with the virus is essential. Previously it has been shown that some neutralising monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) recognise non-linear disulphide bond dependent epitopes (Lorenzen et al., 1990; Béarzotti et al., 1995), and that di#erences in neutralisation reactivity of MAbs recognising the same, or at least closely related epitopes, may be used for typing of VHSV isolates (Olesen et al., 1993). This report focuses on di#erences in the inferred amino acid sequence of the Ig variable domain genes from three hybridomas and relates them to the ability of the respective MAbs to interact with VHSV in neutralisation and ELISA. II. Materials and Methods
VIRUSES

VHSV isolates were passaged in BF2 cells (Wolf et al., 1966) for production of purified virus and in EPC cells (Fijan et al., 1983) for production of virus for plaque neutralisation. Purification of virus particles by ultra centrifugation in sucrose gradients was performed as described earlier (Lorenzen et al., 1993). The following VHSV isolates were used in this study: DK-F1 (Jensen, 1965), DK-3592B (Lorenzen et al., 1990), both belonging to serogroup I, DK-5131 belonging to serogroup II, DK-5151 and DK-6137 both belonging to serogroup III as defined by Olesen et al. (1993). For simplicity, the virus isolates will be referred to as I-F1, I-92, II-31, III-51, III-37, respectively, in the remaining text. The protein concentration of purified virus preparations was estimated by the Coomassie blue micro assay described by Rylatt & Parish (1982) and modified by Machart & Gerbaut (1982). Purified bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma, fraction V) was used as the standard.
MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES

Three MAbs recognising the VHSV G protein were used in the study: one non-neutralising MAb, IP1H3 (Lorenzen et al., 1988) and two neutralising MAbs, 3F1H10 (called MAb I by Lorenzen et al., 1990) and 3F1A2. The latter two MAbs were produced by hybridomas originating from the same fusion of spleen and myeloma cells. Selection and subsequent cloning in the case of 3F1A2 was performed as described earlier (Lorenzen et al., 1990) with the exception that virus isolates not neutralised by MAb 3F1H10 were included in the screening steps. For clarity, the MAbs will be referred to as H3, H10 and A2 respectively. All three MAbs belong to the IgG1/ subclass and were used in purified form prepared by protein A a$nity chromatography as outlined by

Lorenzen et al., (1990). Quantification of purified Ig was performed by measuring the absorbance of the solution at 280 nm (A280) assuming that 0·1 mg Ig ml 1 corresponds to A280 =0·14. The murine Ig content of hybridoma supernatants was also estimated by sandwich ELISA using rabbit anti-mouse Ig as the capture and detecting antibody (Lorenzen et al., 1988). For biotinylation, purified MAbs were diluted to 1 mg ml 1 and dialysed against 0·1 M NaHCO3, pH 8·0, followed by the addition of 0·01 vol. N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin stock solution (40 mg ml 1 in dimethylformamide). After incubation for 3 h at room temperature with gentle stirring, biotinylated MAbs were dialysed against 0·1 M phosphate bu#ered saline, pH 7·2 (PBS).
CLONING AND SEQUENCING OF VH AND V DOMAIN GENES

The genes encoding the VH and V domains of MAbs H10, A2 and H3 were cloned using the technique of Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends, or RACE (Frohman et al., 1988) which allows PCR driven amplification between a defined internal priming site and an unknown sequence at the 5 end of the coding sequence. A representation of the cloning strategy is shown in Fig. 1. Total RNA was extracted from approximately 107 hybridoma cells by the method of Sambrook et al. (1989). The sequences of the primers used in the PCR are shown in Table 1. First strand cDNA was synthesised from total cellular RNA using gene specific primers which annealed close to the 5 end of the Ig CH1 (primer CH1FOR or CH2FOR) or C (primer C FOR1 or C FOR2) constant regions and primed synthesis of the complementary strand through the variable region towards the 5 end of the Ig mRNAs. First strand cDNA was then purified to remove excess primers and dNTPs and a homopolymer C tail was added to the 3 end using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The intervening sequence was then amplified using a poly G primer complementary to the poly C 3 tail and a nested primer, VHFOR or V FOR, complementary to the respective variable region coding sequence downstream from the CHFOR1/CHFOR2 or C FOR1/C FOR2 annealing site. Amplification protocols were essentially those described by Frohman et al. (1988). The amplification products were analysed by electrophoresis through a 1·6% (w/v) agarose-TAE gel. The expected size of the PCR products was approximately 500 bp for both the VH and V chain though the size varied slightly due to the unpredictable length of the homopolymer tails and whether any 5 RNase degradation of the original mRNA occurred. PCR products were excised from the agarose gel and purified using a DNA purification kit (Qiagen), and cloned into a plasmid vector (T-vector, Promega). Plasmid extracts from recombinant clones were sequenced using an ABI 377 Automated Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The sequences obtained were analysed using GCG DNA analysis software provided by the Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, U.K.
NEUTRALISATION

Purified MAbs were diluted to equal Ig concentrations and the ability of each MAb to neutralise virus was determined by the 50% plaque neutralisation test (PNT) as described earlier (Lorenzen et al., 1990).

Briefly, equal volumes of virus (diluted to induce about 30­50 plaques per well) and two-fold dilutions of antibody starting from 500 g Ig ml 1 were mixed, incubated overnight at 15 C and 10 l well 1 of the mixture was added to 96 well plates containing EPC cell monolayers. After adsorption for 1 h, 150 l tissue culture medium containing 1% methylcellulose was added to the wells. After 5 days at 15 C, the cells were fixed, stained and plaques counted. The Ig concentration reducing the number of plaques to approximately 50% compared to control wells without antibody was estimated as the mean of two parallel determinations for each MAb.

ELISA

ELISAs were performed in 96 well microtitre plates with 50 l reagent volume per well according to earlier described procedures (Lorenzen et al., 1988). Briefly, wells were coated with purified virus overnight at 4 C in PBS. Subsequent incubation steps were either 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 C. The following solutions were also employed: PBS containing 0·05% Tween-20 (washing bu#er); PBS containing 0·05% Tween-20 and 1% BSA (blocking and antibody dilution bu#er). Five or 10% normal rabbit serum was also included in the blocking bu#er to minimise background reactivity. Horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugates were used as detection reagents with o-phenylenediamine as colour substrate. Reactions were measured as the absorbance at 492 nm. Comparative binding To compare reactivity levels five-fold dilutions of MAbs initially adjusted to 50 g Ig ml 1 were applied to virus coated wells after washing and blocking. Detection of bound MAbs after washing was carried out with polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse Ig conjugated to HRP (DAKO). Inhibition The binding inhibition ELISA protocol used to evaluate epitope overlap between MAbs was essentially that of Olesen et al. (1993) with minor modifications. Microtitre wells were coated with approximately 20 ng well 1 purified VHSV I-F1. After washing and blocking, 5 g well 1 of unlabelled (inhibiting) MAbs or bu#er without MAbs were applied and allowed to bind to virus for 1 h. The unlabelled MAbs were then removed and without washing,

0·25 or 1 g well 1 biotinylated MAbs were added to the plates and after incubation and washing, bound biotinylated MAbs were detected with streptavidin conjugated to HRP (DAKO). Reactivity was expressed as percentage colour development after setting the value obtained with bu#er without inhibiting MAb to 100%.

BIACORE ANALYSIS

The binding kinetics of the purified MAbs were determined using surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore AB, Herts, U.K.) (Karlsson et al., 1991). Briefly, purified G protein, derived from VHSV strains I-F1 and I-92 (prepared by a$nity chromatography with immobilised MAb A2 as described by Einer-Jensen et al., 1998) was diluted to 4 g ml 1 in sodium acetate pH 3·5. Five thousand one hundred resonance units (RU) and 2600 RU were immobilised respectively to the sensor chip (CM5) surface by standard amine coupling (BIAcore AB). MAbs were diluted in Hanks balanced salt (HBS) bu#er [10 mM HEPES, pH 7·4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0·005% (v/v) surfactant P20; BIAcore AB] and duplicate analyses performed using concentrations ranging 1000­100 nM. All a$nity measurements were performed at room temperature in HBS with a constant flow rate of 5 l min 1 and an injected sample volume of 10 l min 1. Between samples, the chip surface was regenerated with 100 mM HCl. Kinetic constants were determined using BIAevaluation 2·1 software (BIAcore AB). The determinations included ka, the association rate constant and kd, the dissociation rate constant. KD is the dissociation constant calculated as kd/ka. III. Results
ANTIBODY QUANTIFICATION

When the quantitative ELISA, using an external IgG1 MAb as reference (Lorenzen et al., 1988), was used to estimate the mouse IgG content of purified antibody preparations, the concentrations were approximately 50% of those obtained by measuring A280. This relationship was observed for all three MAbs and the preparations were therefore considered to be qualitatively similar in terms of mouse Ig content.

NEUTRALISATION

MAbs A2 and H10 neutralised the type I isolates VHSV I-F1 and I-92 similarly. Higher concentrations of both MAbs were needed to neutralise type II isolates and even higher concentrations were required to neutralise type III isolates (Table 2). Some type III isolates were not neutralised at all (data not shown). When the MAbs were tested against the serotype II and III isolates MAb A2 appeared considerably more e$cient than MAb H10, as 10­500 times lower concentrations of A2 were needed to mediate a 50% reduction in the

number of plaques (Table 2). The MAb H3 hybridoma supernatant did not neutralise any of the virus isolates when tested in concentrations up to 250 g ml 1.

COMPARATIVE ELISA

When the reactivities of five-fold dilutions of the MAbs were compared for di#erent virus isolates MAb H3 recognised all isolates equally well. Increasing reactivity with H3 was thus observed when virus isolates I-92 and II-31 were applied in more concentrated forms compared to I-F1 in the coating step (Fig. 2a­c). The two neutralising MAbs recognised VHSV I-F1 isolate (used for immunisation of mice) similarly, MAb H10 giving slightly lower signals compared to A2 (Fig. 2a). Despite coating with 20 ng well 1 of VHSV I-92 compared to 10 ng well 1 of VHSV I-F1, both neutralising MAbs bound this virus less e$ciently than I-F1. Furthermore, the superior binding of A2 compared to H10 was more evident for the I-92 isolate than in the case of I-F1 (Fig. 2b). For the type II virus isolate both higher antigen and higher antibody concentrations were necessary to obtain a detectable signal. Even when 100 ng well 1 of VHSV II-31 was used for coating, 25­125-fold more antibody was necessary to achieve reactivity levels comparable to those obtained with type I virus isolates. As with the I-92 isolate, MAb A2 gave a stronger signal than MAb H10 with VHSV II-31 (Fig. 2c). No ELISA assays were performed with type III isolates due to the unfeasible antigen demand.

INHIBITION ELISA

When unlabelled MAbs A2 or H10 were used as inhibiting antibody, binding of biotinylated A2 and H10 were both significantly reduced, as indicated by an absorbance signal below 30% of that obtained without inhibiting antibody. Unlabelled MAb H3 did not inhibit the binding of the two other MAbs, which correspondingly did not interfere significantly with the binding of biotinylated MAb H3 (Table 3).

INFERRED VH AND V

AMINO ACID SEQUENCES

The cDNA sequences of the VH and V domain genes of MAbs A2, H10 and H3 have been lodged with EMBL and can be accessed using the following accession numbers Y13988 (3F1A2 VH), Y13989 (3F1H10 VH), Y13990 (IP1H3 VH), Y13991 (3F1H10 V ), Y13992 (3F1A2 V ) and Y13993 (1P1H3 V ). The alignments of the inferred amino acid sequence of the VH and V domains are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The amino acid sequences encoding the VH domain of A2 and H10 were 97% identical and contained only three residues which were di#erent. One of these residues lies in the complementarity determining region 1 (CDR1) while two resided in CDR 2. Each of these

changes was the result of a single base change. Only two other base changes were noted on comparison of these two cDNA sequences but they did not alter the amino acid encoded. The inferred amino acid sequences of the V domains were also very similar between A2 and H10 with only one residue in framework 3 (between CDR2 and CDR3) di#ering between the two sequences. The cDNA sequences of these two V clones contained four silent nucleotide di#erences. In contrast, the inferred amino acid sequence of the VH domains of MAb H3 was quite distinct from that of the other two clones sharing only 38 and 39% identity with the A2 and H10 VH domains respectively. Similarly, the V domains of MAb H3 shared only 49 and 50% identity with the A2 and H10 V domains respectively.
ANTIBODY BINDING KINETICS

The binding kinetics of the purified MAbs were determined by surface plasmon resonance. There was no significant di#erences between either the on-rates (ka) or the o#-rates (kd) for the two neutralising MAbs against I-F1 G protein. However, when the I-92 antigen was immobilised, a seven-fold faster o#-rate was observed with MAb H10 (Table 4). When the o#-rates with the di#erent virus isolates were compared for each MAb, A2 had a 12-fold faster rate with I-92 G protein than with the I-F1 G protein, and H10 had a 44-fold higher o#-rate with the I-92 G protein. The o#-rate di#erences generally implied similar di#erences in the dissociation constants KD (Table 4). For MAb H3, the o#-rates were similar for the two antigens. IV. Discussion In order to analyse the genetic background of di#erences between antibodies which neutralise and bind the fish pathogenic virus VHSV, three MAbs were characterised in terms of their PNT and ELISA reactivity, the binding kinetics were analysed and the variable domain cDNA sequences from the respective Ig genes were compared.

A critical point in the present comparison of MAb reactivities, is whether the mouse Ig content in the purified antibody preparations have been determined correctly and whether the secondary antibodies recognise the three MAbs equally. Quantification of Ig concentrations by A280 and sandwich ELISA gave di#erent results, but as the relative relationship between the two assays were similar for all three MAbs, the antibody preparations were assumed to be similar in terms of purity of the mouse Ig. Whether the discrepancy between the two assays may be due to incorrect Ig content in the reference MAb preparation used in ELISA or to impurities in the MAb IgG samples, e.g. in the form of bovine IgG from the hybridoma medium, remains to be analysed. The competitive ELISA binding assay, with VHSV I-F1 as antigen, did not allow detailed comparison of inhibition levels, but did demonstrate that the two neutralising MAbs A2 and H10 were able to interfere with each others binding reciprocally. These MAbs, therefore, probably bound the same or at least partially related epitopes, distinct from the one recognised by the non-neutralising MAb H3. Isolation of a MAb A2 neutralisation-escape mutant of VHSV 1­92, also resistant to neutralisation by MAb H10, confirmed the relatedness of the two epitopes and mapped the antigen binding site to the central part of the VHSV G protein (unpublished results). Recently, the epitope recognised by MAb H3 has been mapped to a distant location in the C-terminal end of the G protein (Fernandez et al., 1998). Earlier analysis showed that the H3 epitope is of a linear nature, whereas the epitope(s) bound by MAbs H10 and A2 is conformational, in the sense of being dependent on intramolecular disulphide bonds (Lorenzen et al., 1990, 1999). MAbs H10 and A2 neutralised serogroup I virus isolates I­F1 and I­92, even at high dilutions. Higher concentrations of MAbs were needed to obtain neutralisation of virus isolates classified as serotype II or III. Originally the serogroups were defined using MAbs in the form of diluted hybridoma supernatants and MAb H10 neutralised only type I isolates (Olesen et al., 1993). The results presented here demonstrate that use of MAb H10 in a more concentrated form implies neutralisation of a broader range of virus isolates. As illustrated by the high reactivity of the non-neutralising MAb H3 in the comparative ELISA, no general relationship between binding of an antibody to virus and neutralisation exists. Similar observations have been noted with other viruses (Dimmock, 1995). However, in the case of MAbs A2 and H10

140

decreased binding to the less e$ciently neutralised type II and III VHSV isolates was observed in ELISA. This suggests that the lower e$cacy in neutralisation may be explained by a lower ability of the MAbs to bind these virus isolates. The binding kinetic analyses may provide some explanation of the ELISA reactivity patterns concerning virus isolates I-F1 and I-92. The on-rates (ka) for antibody­antigen associations with the neutralising MAbs were similar for the two virus isolates, whereas significantly faster o#-rates (kd) were observed for I-92. Furthermore, the lower reactivity of MAb H10 with this isolate correlated with a faster kd compared to MAb A2, indicating that the stability of the antigen­antibody complex was lower with MAb H10. Removal of antibody and subsequent washing in the ELISA assay may thus reduce the amount of bound H10 more than in the case of A2. Despite this, no significant di#erence was evident in the capacity of the two MAbs to neutralise this virus isolate. Thus, it could be speculated that the o#-rate constant kd is less important in the neutralisation assay. Studies of the mechanism of neutralisation including analysis of reversibility following antibody binding are required to address this hypothesis. In reviewing studies of relationships between antibody a$nity and neutralisation of HIV virus, Dimmock (1995) concluded that increase in a$nity benefits neutralisation of heterologous strains most and the homologous strain least, possibly because the neutralising activity of the latter had reached a plateau. Something similar could explain why MAb A2, despite an apparent stronger binding to the type I VHSV isolate I-92 in the solid phase assays, only neutralized more heterologous VHSV isolates better than MAb H10. Future analysis for correlation of the binding kinetics of the MAbs with the ELISA and PNT assays in the case of serotype II and III isolates may elucidate this matter. The few amino acid di#erences in the variable domains of the Ig sequences of MAbs H10 and A2 presumably explain the di#erences in antibody reactivity observed in all three assays. The hybridomas producing the two MAbs were derived from the same spleen, and the high conservation of the VH and V chain sequences indicate that the parental spleen cells were closely related and possibly originated form the same virgin B-cell. The observed amino acid substitutions probably identify positions in the variable Ig sequences directly or indirectly involved in binding to the VHSV G protein. The virus isolates included in the present study all di#er within two or more amino acid residue positions in the region where the H10 and A2 MAbs are thought to bind (unpublished data). Analyses of how single amino acid substitutions in either antibody paratope or antigen epitope a#ect the interaction will require availability of mutagenised antibodies as well as a panel of single-point neutralisation escape mutants and represents an interesting challenge for future research. The present study demonstrates how a minor variability in the paratope region may reflect the reactivity of an antibody in di#erent assays and represents an initial step towards a better understanding of antibody­antigen interactions in the case of two VHSV neutralising MAbs. Neutralising antibodies may play an important role in vaccine induced immunity of rainbow trout to VHS (Boudinot et al., 1998; Lorenzen et al., 1999), and

detailed knowledge of the protective mechanism and how to induce it will be highly valuable in future work on vaccine development. However, before this can be achieved, it is necessary to analyse how fish Ig interacts with VHSV in the process of neutralisation. In contrast to the MAbs dealt with here, trout Igs neutralise VHSV in a complement dependent manner (Dorson and Torchy, 1979) and it is possible that di#erent epitopes are involved.
