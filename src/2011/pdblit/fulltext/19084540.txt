Abstracts / Cytokine 43 (2008) 291­295 mediator in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory diseases and tumor progression. @Thus, there is an increasing need to understand the TNF-receptor (TNFR1 and TNFR2) biology for the development of TNFR-selective drugs. Nonetheless, the role of TNFRs, especially that of TNFR2, remains poorly understood. As part of analyzing the mechanism of the two TNFRs, we have investigated the structure-function relationship of a large number of receptor selective TNF variants, in which each amino acid residue at positions 29, 31, 32, 145, 146, and 147 is replaced by a different residue. Here, we optimized our phage display-based cytokine mutagenesis technology with an unique subtractive panning technique and functional selection protocol to create novel TNFR2-specific TNF variants with higher affinity and bioactivity. In this subtractive panning technique, phage libraries were pre-incubated with TNFR1, and biopanning against the TNFR2 was carried out in the presence of TNFR1 using BIAcore biosensor. Since TNFR1-binding clones could not bind to TNFR2 due to steric hindrance, TNF variants binding only to TNFR2 are selectively enriched with high efficiency. After 2 rounds of competitive-subtractive panning, we have successfully identified TNFR2-selective TNF variants with full bioactivity via TNFR2. Among these mutants, the R2-9 clone revealed very high TNFR2-selectivity (1.80 105 fold higher than that for the wild-type TNF), which is so far highest among the reported TNFR2-selective TNF variants. Because of its high TNFR2-selectivity and full bioactivity, the TNF variant R2-9 would not only help in elucidating the functional role of TNFR2 but would also help in understanding the structure-function relationship of TNF/TNFR2. In summary, our onestep competitive-subtractive panning system is a simple, useful and effective technology for tuning receptor-selectivity for various cytokines. doi:10.1016/j.cyto.2008.07.298

The individual contributions of TNFR1 and TNFR2 to various host defense functions and immunologic surveillance, however, are not known. Here, we used phage display techniques to generate receptor-selective TNF mutants that activate only one TNFR. These TNF mutants will be useful for functional analysis of TNFR. Six amino acids in the receptor binding interface (near TNF residues 30, 80, and, 140) were randomly mutated by polymerase chain reaction. Two phage libraries comprising over 5 million TNF mutants were constructed. Candidate TNF mutants with selectivity for TNFR1 (16) and TNFR2 (4) were isolated based on receptor-selective affinity. The TNFR1selective candidates were highly mutated near residue 30, whereas TNFR2-selective candidates were highly mutated near residue 140, although both had conserved sequences near residue 140 and 30, respectively. This finding suggested that the phage display technique was suitable for identifying important regions for the TNF interaction with TNFR1 and TNFR2. Purified clone R1-6, a TNFR1-selective candidate, remained fully bioactive and had full affinity for TNFR1 without activating TNFR2, indicating the usefulness of the R1-6 TNF mutant for analyzing TNFR1 receptor function. To further elucidate the receptor selectivity of R1-6, we examined the structure of R1-6 by X-ray crystallography. The results suggested that the R31A and R32G mutations strongly influenced the electrostatic interaction with TNFR2, and a L29K mutation contributed to the binding of R1-6 to TNFR1. This phage display technique can be used to efficiently construct functional mutants for analysis of the TNF structure-function relationship, which might facilitate in silico drug design based on receptor selectivity. doi:10.1016/j.cyto.2008.07.299
