The Introduction of Strain and its Effects on the Structure and Stability of T4 Lysozyme
Rangjiao Liu, Walter A. Baase and Brian W. Matthews*
Institute of Molecular Biology Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Physics, University of Oregon Eugene, OR, 97403, USA In order to try to better understand the role played by strain in the structure and stability of a protein a series of ``small-to-large'' mutations was made within the core of T4 lysozyme. Three different alanine residues, one involved in backbone contacts, one in side-chain contacts, and the third adjacent to a small cavity, were each replaced with subsets of the larger residues, Val, Leu, Ile, Met, Phe and Trp. As expected, the protein is progressively destabilized as the size of the introduced side-chain becomes larger. There does, however, seem to be a limit to the destabilization, suggesting that a protein of a given size may be capable of maintaining only a certain amount of strain. The changes in stability vary greatly from site to site. Substitution of larger residues for both Ala42 and Ala98 substantially destabilize the protein, even though the primary contacts in one case are predominantly with side-chain atoms and in the other with backbone. The results suggest that it is neither practical nor meaningful to try to separate the effects of introduced strain on sidechains from the effects on the backbone. Substitutions at Ala129 are much less destabilizing than at sites 42 or 98. This is most easily understood in terms of the pre-existing cavity, which provides partial space to accommodate the introduced side-chains. Crystal structures were obtained for a number of the mutants. These show that the changes in structure to accommodate the introduced side-chains usually consist of essentially rigid-body displacements of groups of linked atoms, achieved through relatively small changes in torsion angles. On rare occasions, a side-chain close to the site of substitution may change to a different rotamer. When such rotomer changes occur, they permit the structure to dissipate strain by a response that is plastic rather than elastic. In one case,   a surface loop moves 1.2 A, not in direct response to a mutation, but in an interaction mediated via an intermolecular contact. It illustrates how the structure of a protein can be modiÆed by crystal contacts.

Introduction
It is generally believed that the hydrophobic effect is the dominant driving force in protein folding. At the same time, many other factors, including the restraints on conformation imposed by the need to avoid or to minimize unfavorable steric clashes and to avoid the introduction of defects in packing contribute to structure and stability (Karpusas et al., 1989; Baldwin et al., 1996). Steric disruption of structure by ``small-to-large'' mutations within the core of a protein can have a

large effect on its stability (Alber & Matthews, 1987; Sandberg & Terwilliger, 1989; Dao-pin et al., 1991). Conversely, there are some mutants of T4 lysozyme that suggest that protein stability can be enhanced by the release of strain (Dao-pin et al., 1990; Anderson et al., 1993; Pjura & Matthews, 1993). Notwithstanding the evidence that strain plays a critical role in protein stability, and in protein-protein, protein-DNA and protein-ligand interactions, strain is perhaps the most poorly understood aspect of protein structure. How and to what extent can a protein structure relax to minimize strain? What are the energetic costs associated with introduced strain? Is strain involving backbone

128 atoms ``worse'' than strain involving side-chains? To address these basic questions, we constructed a series of small-to-large mutants that deliberately introduce strain within T4 lysozyme. Three completely buried alanine residues (Ala42, Ala98 and Ala129) were selected for study. The side-chain Cb atom of Ala98 is located at the point of contact between two a-helices (Figure 1). The mutant Ala98 3 Val was previously isolated as a randomly generated temperature-sensitive mutant (Dao-pin et al., 1991). The structure, which was determined in the wild-type background instead of the cysteine-free pseudo-wild-type background (WT*) used here, showed that the introduced valine side-chain caused a steric clash with the backbone of helix F. The other two selected alanine residues (Ala42 and Ala129) are also located in a-helices, and their side-chains are pointing inward toward the center of the molecule, but they are not close to surrounding main-chain atoms. Thus, the substitutions at these two sites were anticipated to generate primarily side-chain clashes. Taken together, the mutation sites were intended to permit a comparison of the effects of strain involving backbone and side-chain atoms. In addition, there is a cavity near the site of Ala129 and the packing environment at this site appears to be ``looser'' than at the other two sites. To analyze the effect of successively larger substitutions, we incorporated subsets of valine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine and tryptophan at each site.

Results
Thermal stability and inferred strain energy Table 1 gives the change in free energy of unfolding of each mutant relative to WT* (¡¡G). The changes in stability are compared in Figure 2(a). Not surprisingly, the protein is destabilized when larger side-chains are substituted in the core, ¡¡G varying from ¿1.0 kcal/mol for Ala98 3 Cys, up to ¿6 kcal/mol for Ala98 3 Phe. The enthalpy of unfolding also decreases for the less stable variants. There are substantial differences from site to site. For example, the mutant with the substitution Ala 3 Phe at site 98 is destabilized by 6 kcal/mol, compared to 1.2 kcal/mol for the Ala 3 Phe substitution at site 129. Since all the sites of substitution are within the protein, and only non-polar side-chains are involved, the strain energy (¡¡Gstrain) associated with a given substitution can be estimated by taking the experimentally observed loss of stability in the mutant and correcting for changes in solvent transfer free energy and for changes in side-chain entropy. This can be written as: ¡¡Gstrain  ¡¡G ¿ ¡¡Gtransfer  T¡¡Ssidechain 1 where ¡¡G is the observed differential change in the free energy of unfolding, ¡¡Gtransfer is the difference between the solvent transfer free energy of the mutant side-chain relative to wild-type (Fauchere & Pliska, 1983), and ¡¡Ssidechain is the difference between the side-chain conformational entropy upon unfolding (Table 1). We assume that the entropy of a buried side-chain in the folded structure is zero, and in the unfolded state is as estimated by Monte Carlo simulations (Creamer & Rose, 1992). The value for cysteine (not given by Creamer & Rose, 1992) was taken from the estimate based on rotamer libraries (Blaber et al., 1994). The use of equation (1) to estimate strain energy assumes that the substituted side-chain is fully buried, but otherwise does not require knowledge of structure. Figure 2(b) shows the inferred strain energies for each mutant. Crystallographic structures The crystal structures of seven mutants were determined and reÆned (see Table 2). Representative difference density maps are shown for four of the mutants (A98V, A98L, A42V and A129F) in Figure 3. The superposition of each of the mutant structures on WT* is shown in Figure 4. The overall changes in structure are summarized in Table 3.

In the following paragraphs we give a very brief summary of the structure of each mutant. Mutant A98C As shown in Figure 4(a), the replaced side-chain atoms are directly between the two a-helices that include residues 93 to 106 (helix E) and 144 to 154 (helix J). In the structure of A98C, the two a-helices are forced apart slightly. The displacements in the backbone of helix E around the mutation site are   less than 0.3 A, while the helix backbone of J has   movements in excess of 0.4 A. Each helix has maximum shifts at the turn closest to the mutation site and successively smaller displacements as the distance from the site of substitution increases. In effect, a slight bend of about 2  is induced in helix E, and about 5  in helix J. The side-chain of Thr152   is pushed away by up to 0.8 A, as are, to a lesser degree, the surrounding side-chains, such as Phe153, Trp158 and Met6. Mutant A98V The difference electron density map for A98V (Figure 3(a)) shows two strong positive features indicating the two methyl groups of Val98. There are surrounding positive and negative features

indicating shifts in side-chain and main-chain atoms. Thr152 is the locus of the largest such features. The superposition of the mutant structure on WT* (Figure 4(b)) shows that the changes in structures are quite similar to those in A98C but the   movements are much larger. There are up to 0.5 A displacements in the backbone of helix E and the helix bending angle is about 3.0  . The neighboring   helix, J, is pushed away by up to 0.6 A and has a  bending angle of about 3.4 . The side-chain of   Thr152 is pushed away by 0.7 A. The new sidechain of Val98 has a low energy conformation, indicating the mutated residue is not under signiÆcant torsion strain. There is no major change in side-chain rotamer angles adjacent to the site of mutation, although slightly further away, toward the surface, w1 of Arg154 changes from 211  to 265  (Figure 4(b)). Mutant A98L The difference electron density map of A98L (Figure 3(b)) shows very strong positive features at the sites of the new side-chain atoms. The negative and positive features in the neighborhood indicate the movements of surrounding atoms. The locus of major difference is again at Thr152. Compared

with A98C and A98V, there is a signiÆcant shift in Met6, which can be inferred from the negative feature that overlaps this side-chain. From the superimposed structures of A98L and WT* (Figure 4(c)), the Ca atom of 98 on helix E is   seen to move by 0.7 A and the helix is bent by 5.4  , while the backbone of the other helix is   pushed away by up to 0.7 A and has a bending

angle of 8  . The side-chain of Thr152 is shifted up   to 1.4 A, but its dihedral torsion angle is barely changed. w1 of Leu98 has a low energy conformation (¿52  ), while w2 (191  ) has a slightly greater deviation from the ``ideal'' value. The contour map showing the difference in Ca-Ca distances between A98L and WT* (Figure 5(a)) indicates some apparent backbone

movements around residues 22 and 52 in the Nterminal domain well away from the site of the mutation. These shifts appear to be transmitted indirectly via crystal contacts, since these two regions are close to each other in symmetry-related molecules. Mutant A98M Mutant A98M crystallized in space group P31 with two molecules per asymmetric unit. The two molecules have hinge-bending angles of 12.7  and

13.2  relative to WT* (Table 3). As a result, the distance between the N and C-terminal domains substantially increases, as can be seen by the very strong positive features in the difference Ca-Ca plots (Figure 5(b)). There are movements at the inter-domain region, with helix J moving outward and helix I shifting inward. Figure 4(d) compares chain A of A98M with WT* in the vicinity of the mutation. The backbone   of helix E is shifted by about 0.5 A, and the helix bends 2.4  . The Ca atom of Thr152 within helix J is   pushed away by 1 A and the helix is bent by

10.1  . The backbone of the introduced side-chain is directed toward Met6, causing the side-chain   atoms to move up to 1.3 A and the backbone in   the vicinity of Met6 and Leu7 to shift up to 0.8 A. The overall structure of chain B is generally similar to, although not identical with that, of chain A. In particular, the side-chain of Met98 adopts a different conformation and, in concert, so does Met6 (Figure 4(d) and (e)). Mutant A42V A42V is the only substitution at site 42 for which crystals could be obtained. It was anticipated that substitutions at this site would cause primarily side-chain steric clashes. Figures 3(c), 4(f) and 5(c) show that the main-chain atoms of helix B at the   mutation site are shifted by up to 1.2 A, causing a bend in the helix of about 4.7  . Notwithstanding

these substantial movements, the newly introduced valyl side-chain at site 42 has a low-energy conformation (w1  ¿ 176  ). Mutant A129F The difference in electron density between the mutant A129F and WT* (Figure 3(d)) shows a strong positive feature corresponding to the substituted aromatic ring of Phe129. The surrounding negative features indicate only relatively modest movements of neighboring atoms. w1 of the introduced side-chain is 146  , suggesting fairly high torsion strain. The introduced aromatic ring of Phe129 is located between four roughly parallel ahelices, E (residues 93 to 106), G (residues of 115 to 123), H (residues 126 to 134) and J (residues 143 to 155) (Figure 4(g)). The mutated side-chain does not have any direct contact with any backbone atoms,

although it is relatively closer to helix G. In the plot showing differences in Ca-Ca distances between the mutant and WT* (Figure 5(d)), the strongest positive features are not at the site of

mutation but in the region around residue 21. This is almost certainly due to a crystal contact between the residue 21 region and helix G in a symmetryrelated molecule.

The alignments are based on the least-squares superposition of the main-chain atoms of residues 81 to 161 for mutants at sites 98 and 129, while the backbone atoms of residues 15 to 60 were used for mutant A42V.

Mutant A129W In this mutant, the newly introduced tryptophan side-chain has a relatively low energy conformation with w1  174  and w2  95  (Figure 4(h)).   The backbone of helix H is shifted by up to 0.9 A and has a bending angle of 12  . The terminus of helix J at residue 154 is pushed away by about   0.9 A, causing a bending angle of about 9  . There are substantial changes in surrounding side-chains, including Phe114, Ser117, Leu118, Met120 and Leu121. The reÆnement suggests that the structural adjustments result in the displacement of an internal water molecule, which in WT* is bound in the vicinity of Asn101, Gln105 and Trp138.

Discussion
The effect of strain on structure: backbone versus side-chain The objective of this study was to destabilize T4 lysozyme by introducing larger side-chains within the core. By subtracting hydrophobicity and sidechain entropy, we estimated the strain energy that results from a given substitution and attempted to correlate this with the structural environment and any changes in structure that might be observed. One overall feature of the results is that there may be a limit to the loss of stability that can result from induced strain (Figure 2(b)). In other words,

The RMS deviations of the mutant structure relative to the wild-type are calculated after superposition of the backbone atoms in residues 15 to 60 for the N-terminal domain, or in residues 81 to 161 for the C-terminal domain. For the side-chains, atoms were not   included in the RMS deviation if the B-factor in the WT* or mutant structure exceeded 50 A2. The hinge-bending angle is relative to the wild-type (Zhang et al., 1995). Mutants A42S and A98S are from Blaber et al. (1993) and are included as representative examples of mutations at the same sites investigated here, but with relatively modest structural changes.

strain in excess of some threshold may be released by changes in the structure. The question is how the protein achieves this. Table 3 summarizes the overall changes in structure resulting from the different mutations. Not surprisingly, the domain that contains the mutation always has the larger shifts, although there are usually some changes in the other domain as well. For mutations at the same site, the changes in both domains increase with larger substitutions. For a given mutant, the shifts in side-chain atoms are always greater than for the main-chain atoms. Bearing in mind that the b-carbon atom of Ala98 is directed toward backbone atoms, whereas the b-carbon of Ala42 points at the side-chain of Tyr25, it is somewhat surprising that A42V has substantially greater backbone deformation than A98V     (0.40 A versus 0.19 A). The larger changes for A42V seem to occur because the side-chain of Tyr25 is both inØexible and rigidly held as part of a b-sheet. As a result, it is the backbone at the site of the mutation that is forced to move ``backwards'' by   1.2 A. This behavior illustrates the difÆculty of separating strain involving backbone atoms from strain involving side-chains. Indeed, it illustrates the risks inherent in model-building and protein-design algorithms that rely on the assumption that the backbone can be held Æxed, and only the sidechains allowed to move.

Figures 6 and 7 show the change in structure as a function of distance from the mutation site. The structural changes are not isotropic but, for most mutants, decrease as the distance increases. The major changes in both the main-chain and sidechain atoms are seen to be localized within a   sphere of about 12 A from the mutation site. The molecules thus show an ability to distribute ``strain'' throughout this region. Mutant A98M appears to be atypical in having increasing structural changes at larger distances. This is misleading, however, in that this mutant crystallizes in a different space group compared with other mutants and has a change of about 13  in the hinge-bending angle. The structural changes at larger distances are due to interdomain motion and movement of residues in the hinge-region itself (Zhang et al., 1995). In general, the nature of the structural changes seen here are consistent with those reported previously for other small-to-large substitutions within the cores of proteins (Karpusas et al., 1989; Daopin et al., 1991; Hurley et al., 1992; Varadarajan & Richards, 1992; Baldwin et al., 1993; Lim et al., 1994; Richards & Lim, 1994; Baldwin et al., 1996; Wynn et al., 1996, 1997). One of the major common Ændings is that the rotamer angles of the sidechains surrounding the site of substitution tend to be maintained (Baldwin et al., 1993). Thus, the

139 Therefore, in attempting to predict the likely consequences of a small-to-large substitution in a protein, the best procedure may be to simply enumerate all pre-existing cavities in the protein. As shown in Table 4, there is in WT* lysozyme a   cavity of volume 20 A3 immediately adjacent to Ala129. This cavity is located in such a way that it provides at least partial space for any side-chain introduced at site 129. The observation that this cavity is present at site 129, and that there is no such cavity at either site 42 or site 98, provides the most simple and direct rationalization for the difference in behavior at these three sites. Protein elasticity In order to try to estimate the ability of the protein to accept strain at different sites, we combined knowledge of each mutant structure with that of WT*. The mutant structure gives the volume in space that is occupied by the mutant side-chain. By superimposing the WT* structure on that of the mutant, the volume of the extra side-chain atoms introduced in the mutant can be divided into two parts. First, there is the part that overlaps the van der Waals volume of atoms present in the WT* structure. This volume can be considered as ``steric overlap'' or ``steric clash'' and is designated Vclash. The remainder of the volume of the introduced side-chain atoms does not overlap the van der Waals volume of the native protein and is designated Vgap. Dividing the strain energy, ¡¡Gstrain, by the clash volume, Vclash, gives the energy required for the mutant side-chain to displace a unit volume of the parent structure. This quantity, which in some respects is analogous to a bulk modulus of elasticity, is roughly constant at a given site of substitution but can vary by a factor of 5 from site to site (Table 4). The factor of 5 cannot be completely ascribed to variations in ¡¡G and hence indicates substantial differences in rigidity at different sites within the same protein. Relaxation of strain In the structures of the mutants, there are increasing changes in structure with larger substitutions. Generally speaking, the adjustments in the protein consist of essentially rigid-body shifts in groups of connected atoms, achieved by relatively modest changes in dihedral angles. Occasionally, however, there is a more dramatic change in which a torsional angle switches to a completely different rotamer. One such example occurs in mutant A129F, in which case the w2 angle of Leu118 changes from 173  to 109  (Figure 4(g)). Another example is for mutant A129W, where w1 of Leu121 changes from 289  to 232  (Figure 5(h)). A change of torsion angle is energetically different from a change in bond length or bond angle. The energy cost of deviations of bond lengths, bond angles and even small deviations from optimal van der Waals interaction can be approximated by Hooke's

relaxation of the protein structure to accommodate the larger side-chains tends to be achieved by a   combination of shifts of a few tenths of an Ang» strom unit in the backbone, coupled with small adjustments in the side-chain rotamer angles. Only rarely is repacking achieved by distinct changes in rotamer angles of one or more side-chains. Structural changes introduced by crystal contacts It has been noted that the structure of a protein in a crystal is, to some degree, dependent on crystal contacts (Zhang et al., 1995). This observation was previously based on differences in the structure of the same protein, or very similar proteins, crystallized in different space groups. The present results show, however, that differences can occur even in the same space group. The mutant A129F provides a particularly striking example. Here, the mutation occurs within the core of the C-terminal domain, yet inspection of the Ca-Ca difference distance plot (Figure 5(d)) suggests that the largest   changes in the backbone ($1.2 A) occur near resi  away, at the other end due 20, which is about 25 A of the molecule (Figure 1). What appears to happen is that the substitution Ala129 3 Phe induces   changes of up to 0.6 A in the backbones of helices G and H, at the site of the mutation. Residues 124127, which are in this region, contact residues 1921 in a neighboring molecule in the crystal (see Figure 3 of Weaver & Matthews, 1987), causing the surface loop that includes these residues to move   about 1.2 A (Figure 5(d)). Are small-to-large substitutions accommodated better at sites of low packing density? It is reasonable to expect that a small-to-large substitution will be accommodated more readily at a site in the protein where at least some space is available or, in other words, where the packing of the protein is less than perfect. To check this, we Ærst calculated the Voronoi volume associated with each alanine methyl group at the substitution sites (Richards, 1974). These are given in Table 4. Another approach is to estimate the packing density, although this is not entirely straightforward (Richards, 1974; Pattabiraman et al., 1995). A new procedure that we tested (Liu, 1999), suggested that the packing densities at all three sites are well within the range for other atoms throughout the protein (not shown). In the present context, the limitation in the use of Voronoi volume and packing density calculations is that they apply to the immediate vicinity of the alanine methyl groups but do not sample the full volume that would be required to accommodate an introduced side-chain. For example, in the case of Ala129, there is a relatively large cavity nearby (see below) but the Voronoi volume of the Cb atom does not reØect this in any obvious way.

law, and so are mostly ``elastic''. The energy functions of bond rotations are more complex. When a torsion angle tends to deviate too far from a lowenergy conformation, it can jump to a new rotamer position. In this regard the behavior of the protein is ``plastic''. For this reason, larger changes in structure in the mutants do not necessarily indicate greater strain. Rather, such movement may allow relaxation of strain by ``rotamer jumps''. It may be that this type of structural relaxation also contributes to the relatively modest loss in stability observed for the substitutions at site 129. It could

also serve to limit the total amount of strain that can be maintained within a given protein structure.

Materials and Methods
Protein purification The mutants discussed here were constructed in the cysteine-free pseudo-wild-type lysozyme (WT*) (Matsumura & Matthews, 1989). Mutants A129F and A129W were constructed by Dr Jian Xu. Prior data were available for mutants A129L and A129M (Baldwin et al., 1996).

¡Vsidechain is the difference between the average volume occupied by a given residue in protein crystal structures, i.e. its average Voronoi volume (Gerstein et al., 1994) and the average Voronoi volume of alanine. ¡Vsidechain is made up of two parts, Vclash, the part that superimposes on space occupied by atoms in the WT* structure, and Vgap, the space that is free in the WT* structure (see the text). Cavity volumes in WT* lysozyme are from Xu et al. (1998).

The plots include atoms in the domain within which the mutation is located, and the structures were superimposed as in Figure 6. The deviation at a distance of zero corresponds to the b-carbon atom of the substituted   residue. Atoms were not included if the B-factor in WT* or in the mutant structure exceeded 50 A2.

Methods for site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987) and protein puriÆcation were as described (Poteete et al., 1991). The proteins A98F and A98W formed inclusion bodies. These were refolded in 50 mM citrate buffer (pH 3), 10 % (v/v) glycerol as described (Vetter et al., 1996), yielding solutions up to 5 mg/ml. The molecular masses of all proteins were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry and were within 2.1 Da of the expected values. All samples for electrospray mass spectrometry were prepared in 50 mM citric acid (pH 3), 15 % (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM methionine. Thermal analysis Circular dichroism at 223 nm was used to monitor thermal unfolding (Becktel & Baase, 1987; Eriksson et al., 1993). Proteins were in 25 mM potassium chloride, 3 mM phosphoric acid, 17 mM monopotassium phosphate, pH 3. Thermodynamic analysis was done as described (Eriksson et al., 1993). ¡¡G values were calculated using a constant ¡Cp model (with ¡Cp equal to 1.8 kcal/mol) at an isotherm of 40  C. The majority of the mutants unfold in a two-state manner (see Table 1) and for these the estimated error in ¡tm and ¡¡G is about 0.2 deg. C and 0.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Reversibility of thermal unfolding was judged by restoration of CD signal upon cooling and found to be in excess of 95 %. Crystallization and structure determination Crystals of the mutants A98C and A98V in space group P3221 were obtained at 4  C by the hanging drop method using conditions similar to those used for the wild-type (Eriksson et al., 1993). Crystals of A98L, A42V, A129F and A129W were grown by ``hetero-micro-seeding''. In this procedure, a small number of crystals of

A98C with edges less than 0.01 mm was used to microseed the other mutants. After weeks or even months, somewhat larger crystals appeared in the drops. Several additional cycles of seeding using these eventually produced crystals bigger than 0.2 mm ¬ 0.2 mm ¬ 0.2 mm. Crystallographic data were collected on a San Diego Multiwire Systems area detector (Hamlin, 1985; Zhang & Matthews, 1993) except for mutants A98V and A98 M, for which an R-AXIS IIc image plate system (Molecular Structure Corporation) was used. The crystals of mutant A98M in space group P31 were grown from solutions of approximately 20 mM magnesium chloride, 0.1 M Hepes (pH 7.4), 30 % (w/v) PEG 3400 and 5 ml of oxidized b-mercaptoethanol/ml was added to the mother liquor. Molecular replacement using AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) with the WT* molecule as a search model, suggested two molecules per asymmetric unit. This was conÆrmed by reÆnement. ReÆnement of all mutants was carried out with TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987) using the procedure described by Baldwin et al. (1996). A Æxed parameter set of weights for the stereochemistry restraint was applied during the last cycle of reÆnement, namely BOND  0.8, ANGLE  1.3, TORSION  0, TRIGONAL  2, PLANE  10, CONTACT  5 and BCORREL  1. The weight of RFACTOR was varied from 0.001 to 0.003 to obtain reasonable deviations of stereochemistry (Table 2). Structural analysis and related calculations The program EDPDB (Zhang & Matthews, 1995) was used to perform superpositions of atom coordinates. The Voronoi packing volume was calculated using the programs VOLUME and ACCESS downloaded from Yale's Center for Structural Biology web site (Richards, 1974). A program written by Liu (1999) was used for packing density and other calculations. Coordinates for mutants
