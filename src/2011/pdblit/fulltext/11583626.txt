Yeast Ubp3 and its co-factor Bre5 form a deubiquitylation complex to regulate protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments of the cell. A novel N-terminal domain of the Ubp3 catalytic subunit forms a complex with the NTF2-like domain of the Bre5 regulatory subunit. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of an Ubp3­Bre5 complex and show that it forms a symmetric hetero-tetrameric complex in which the Bre5 NTF2-like domain dimer interacts with two L-shaped -strand­turn­-helix motifs of Ubp3. The Ubp3 N-terminal domain binds within a hydrophobic cavity on the surface of the Bre5 NTF2-like domain subunit with conserved residues within both proteins interacting predominantly through antiparallel -sheet hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. Structure-based mutagenesis and functional studies confirm the significance of the observed interactions for Ubp3­Bre5 association in vitro and Ubp3 function in vivo. Comparison of the structure to other protein complexes with NTF2-like domains shows that the Ubp3­Bre5 interface is novel. Together, these studies provide new insights into Ubp3 recognition by Bre5 and into protein recognition by NTF2-like domains.

Introduction
Deubiquitylation is catalyzed by deubiquitylating proteases (DUBs) that fall into at least five distinct families: the ubiquitin-specific processing proteases or UBPs; the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolases UCHs; the Ataxin-3/Josephin domains; the ovarian tumor domain-containing proteases or OTUs and the JAMM proteases.1 Among these DUB families, the UBPs (also called USPs in human) represent the most widespread deubiquitylating enzymes across evolution and have been implicated to regulate diverse biological processes.1 Homology among the UBP enzymes is restricted to a roughly 350 residue catalytic core domain, while the UBPs

contain variable N-terminal, or occasionally, Cterminal extensions, or insertions in the catalytic domains. The molecular basis for how different UBPs select their cognate substrates and mediate distinct cellular functions is still unclear, although the variable N and C-terminal extensions, association with different cofactor proteins,2,3 and subcellular localization4,5 have been implicated in the process. The structure of the catalytic domain of the UBPs both alone and in complex with ubiquitin,6 and of other regions of the UBPs in complex with regions of their protein substrates7­9 have provided important information underlying the catalytic activity of these enzymes and their mode of substrate targeting. In contrast, there has been no structural information reported to date on a deubiquitylating enzyme in complex with its protein cofactor, and therefore the structural basis for cofactor recognition by ubiquitylating enzymes has remained obscure. One such Ubp­cofactor complex is the Ubp3­Bre5 complex. Ubp3, the yeast homologue of human USP10, has been shown to form a complex with the

Bre5/Ubp3 Complex Structure

195 Yeast Bre5 has two recognizable domains, a nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain at the N terminus (residues 8­140) and a RNA recognition motif (RRM) at the C terminus (residues 419­481) (Figure 1(a)). Although, NTF2-like domains are found in many proteins with diverse activities,13­16 a common function of these domains appears to be that they mediate protein­protein interactions. In previous structure/function studies, we showed that the Bre5 NTF2-like domain forms a tightly associated homodimer that directly associates, also with high affinity, with a folded domain within the N terminus of Ubp3.17 In contrast the RRM is not required for the function of the Bre5­Ubp3 complex at least on Sec23 and -COP substrates.11 Yeast Ubp3 is a 912 amino acid residue protein. The C-terminal half of Ubp3 (450­912) harbors the UCH (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase) catalytic domain, while the N-terminal half has no detectable sequence homology to other proteins

Bre5 cofactor to specifically deubiquitylate and consequently control the expression level of the Sec2310 and -COP11 subunits of the COPII and COPI complexes that regulate anterograde and retrograde transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus,10 respectively. Deubiquitylation by the Ubp3­Bre5 complex has also been shown to play a role in cytoplasm to vacuole (Cvt) trafficking. The substrate for the Ubp3­Bre5 complex in this pathway is the cargo receptor, Atg19p, whose ubquitylation status is a functional component in the Cvt pathway.12 We previously showed that Bre5 is an essential positive regulator for Ubp3-mediated biological function in vivo.10 However, Bre5 does not complement a catalytically inactive Ubp3 and is not involved in substrate recognition.10 Current hypotheses suggest that Bre5 could either influence the targeting of Ubp3 to its specific substrate, or modulate its catalytic activity or both.

196 (Figure 1(a)). Our previous study showed that residues 180­260 within the N-terminal half of Ubp3 harbors a Bre5 binding domain.17 Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of the Bre5-NTF2-like domain in complex with a high affinity N-terminal domain of Ubp3 (residues 189­ 233) that shows that the Ubp3 N-terminal domain adopts a novel L-shaped -sheet­turn­-helix topology that interacts with the Bre5 NTF2-like domain in a mode that differs from other protein complexes with NTF2-like domains. We also perform structure-based mutagenesis and functional studies to confirm the significance of the observed Ubp3­Bre5 complex for Ubp3-cofactor association in vitro and Ubp3 function in vivo. Together, these studies provide new insights into Ubp3 recognition by Bre5 and into protein recognition by NTF2-like domains.

Bre5/Ubp3 Complex Structure

Results and Discussion
Overall structure of the Ubp3/Bre5 hetero-tetramer complex We used X-ray crystallography to determine the high-resolution structure of the NTF2-like domain of Bre5 (Bre5-NTF2, residues 1­146) in complex with an N terminal high affinity binding domain of Ubp3 (residues 189­233, called Ubp3-Nterm to

distinguish it from the C-terminal Ubp3 catalytic domain). The crystals form in the space group P212121 with two subunits each of Bre5-NTF2 and Ubp3-Nterm per asymmetric unit cell. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using Bre5-NTF2 as a search model17 and refined to 1.7 Å resolution with good refinement statistics and geometry (Table 1). Bre5-NTF2 forms a tightly associated homodimer with each Bre5-NTF2 subunit interacting with a domain of Ubp3-Nterm (Figure 1(b) and (c)). The Bre5-NTF2 dimer in the Ubp3/Bre5 complex adopts a mixed / fold that is similar to the free Bre5NTF2-like domain and other NTF2-like domains. Briefly, each Bre5-NTF2 subunit contains a sixstranded (1­6) antiparallel -sheet that forms a curved platform for three -helices (1­3) that lie on the concave side of the -sheet. The dimer interface is formed along the convex surfaces of the -sheets from each of the subunits such that residues from 1 and 3­6 mediate both hydrogen bond and van der Waals contacts. The Ubp3-Nterm domain forms a three residue loop, followed by a seven residue 1-strand, sharp turn and a 15 residue 1-helix (Figure 1(b) and (c)). The strand and helix are nearly perpendicular to each other forming an L-shape. Residues 190­205 of Ubp3-Nterm, N-terminal to the threee residue loop could not be traced into the electron density map and are presumably disordered. The Ubp3­Bre5 interface Bre5-NTF2 and Ubp3-Nterm form nearly symmetrical interactions within the heterotetramer. These interactions are predominantly hydrophobic in nature and can be separated into two distinct regions of contact; between the Ubp3-Nterm 1­sheet­ turn with the 3­sheet and 1-­helix of Bre5-NTF2, and between the N-terminal half of the 1­helix of Ubp3-Nterm with the L2 loop (4 5 turn) and, to a lesser extent, the L1 loop (1 2 turn) of Bre5-NTF2 (Figure 2(a)). Ubp3-Nterm 1 residues 208­210 form antiparallel -sheet hydrogen bonds with the Bre5-NTF2 3 residues 81­83. The side-chains of Ubp3-Nterm 1 residues Leu208, Phe209, Ile210, Asn211 and Phe212 also make a series of side-chain van der Waals interactions with several residues in the 3-strand (Lys80, Leu81, Lys82 and Leu83) and 1-helix (Pro10, Gln14, Tyr17, Glu18 and Arg21) of Bre5NTF2 (Figure 2(b)). In the turn that proceeds the 1 sheet of Ubp3-Nterm, Phe217 also makes a van der Waals contact with the aliphatic region of Lys82 of Bre5-NTerm and Ubp3-term Glu216 makes the only side-chain hydrogen bond in this region with Bre5NTF2 Lys80 (Figure 2(b)). The Ubp3-Nterm 1-helix also makes predominantly van der Waals contacts with the L1 and L2 loops of Bre5. Residues Ala220, Ser221, Gln223 and Arg224 of Ubp3-Nterm make extensive van der Waals interactions with the L2-loop residues Pro112, Val113 and Tyr114 of Bre5-NTF2 (Figure 2(c)). The

A sequence alignment of Ubp3-Nterm with other yeast Ubp3 homologues shows high sequence conservation of residues in the 1­turn­1 region that contact Bre5-NTF2 (Figure 2(c) and (d)). In particular, this region shows the highest conservation outside of the catalytic domain and the majority of the residues that mediate Bre-NTF2 contacts are either strictly or highly conserved within the yeast Ubp3 homologues (Figure 2(d)). Not surprisingly, the residues in Bre5-NTF2 that mediate Ubp3 contacts are also highly conserved within the yeast Bre5 homologues (Figure 2(c)). Taken together, these findings suggest that the yeast Ubp3 homologues adopt a similar 1­turn­1 structure and mediate analogous contacts with their corresponding Bre5 homologues. Interestingly, only part of the yeast Ubp3 conservation extends to the Ubp10 human ortholog (Figure 2(c) and (d)). In particular, of the Ubp3 residues that contact Bre5, only Pro207, Val210, Glu216 and Phe217 show conservation, suggesting that the yeast-specific Ubp3-Bre5 interaction may differ in human. A comparison of the Ubp3-Nterm­Bre5-NTF2 complex with the free Bre5-NTF2 domain shows that, except for the L1 and L2 loops, the Bre5 dimer is essentially superimposable with an RMSD of 1.1 Å for all atoms of Bre5 (Figure 3(a)). Importantly, the conformational changes within the L1 and L2 loops of Bre5 appear to be correlated with Bre5 interaction

with Ubp3. In particular, in the absence of Ubp3 binding, the L1 loop appears flexible with 12 residues (43 to 54) untraceable in the electron density map. In the presence of Ubp3-Nterm, this loop becomes more ordered with only four residues (46 to 49) untraceable in the electron density map of the complex and residues Asp51 and Asp52 of the L1 loop make contacts to Arg24 within the 1­helix of Ubp3. The L2 loop of the Bre5-NTF2 domain undergoes the most dramatic structural shift upon Ubp3Nterm binding and this movement appears to be directly coupled to complex formation. In particular, in the absence of Ubp3-Nterm, this loop and the ends of the -sheets that form it are flipped away from the body of the rest of the Bre5-NTF2 protein. Indeed, this "flipped out" conformation would prevent Ubp3-Nterm binding due to steric occlusion (Figure 3(a)). In the Ubp3-Nterm­Bre5-NTF2 complex, this loop flips inward by about 5 Å towards the body of the protein and forms part of the binding pocket for Ubp3-Nterm (Figure 3(b)). The movement of this loop in the Bre5-NTF2 domain not only helps create a binding site for Ubp3-Nterm but residues Pro112, Val113 and Tyr114 of the loop also directly participate in interactions with the 1­helix of Ubp3-Nterm, as described above. Conservation of Pro112 and Tyr114 of the L2 loop and Asp52 of the L1 loop

199 the Ubp construct differs. While the earlier studies employed the shorter Ubp3 (181­282) construct, the present study employed the longer Ubp3 (189­912) construct that also includes the C-terminal catalytic domain of Ubp3 (Figure 1(a)). Although we do not know the reason for this discrepancy, we hypothesize that other regions of Ubp that are outside of the N-terminal region that is shown in the crystals to contact the Bre5 NTF2-like domain, contributes to 1:1 stoichiometric Bre5­Ubp association. The high concentration of Bre5-NTF2 and Ubp-Nterm in the crystals may shift the equilibrium to the 1:1 stoichiometry, despite the absence of other regions of Ubp3 that might contribute to Bre5­Ubp3 complex formation. Alternatively, a subset of the shorter Ubp3 (181­282) pool of the earlier study might have been improperly folded (consistent with our inability to produce a recombinant Ubp3 (189­233) construct in soluble form, data not shown), thus reducing the pool of Ubp3 available for Bre5-NTF2 binding. Also in an earlier study, we showed that Y42R and R139F mutations in the NTF2-like domain of Bre5 disrupted Upb3 binding in vitro and Ubp3 function in vivo and we had proposed that these residues might be directly involved in Ubp3 interaction. In the current structure we see that these residues are not directly involved in Ubp3 interaction and thus hypothesize that since they are partially buried in the current structure (Y42 making intra-atomic contacts and R139 making inter-atomic contacts) that their mutational properties may be due to a partial disruption of the Bre5 dimer structure that is required for Ubp 3 binding. Taken together, the structure of the Bre5­Ubp3 complex reported here now provides a scaffold from which to understand these earlier results. In vivo analysis of Bre5p­Ubp3 interaction and function To confirm that the Bre5 and Ubp3 interface characterized in vitro is also responsible for in vivo interaction and function of the Bre5­Ubp3 complex, we analyzed the ability of wild-type and interaction mutants of Bre5 and Ubp3 to interact and mediate deubiquitylation in cells. For this purpose, His-tagged versions of wild-type or mutant Bre5 were introduced into Ubp3-HA/bre5 cells as described.11,17 The ability of wild-type and mutant Bre5 protein to interact with endogenous Ubp3 was measured by co-immunoprecipitation using antiHA antibodies followed by Western blotting (Figure 4(d), top panel). The function of the complex between Ubp3 and wild-type or mutant Bre5 was also followed by the capacity of the protein complex to mediate deubiquitylation of Sec23, a substrate for the Bre5­Ubp3 deubiquitylation complex (Figure 4(e), top panel). In addition, His-tagged versions of wild-type or mutant Ubp3 were introduced into Bre5-GFP/ubp3 cells (Figure 4(d) and (e), lower panels) and the extent of Ubp3­Bre5 interaction was also followed both by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP antibodies and the capacity of the

suggests that the L1 and L2 loops of Bre5 may play important roles in Ubp3 association. Structure-based mutagenesis of the Ubp3-Bre5 interface To probe the functional importance of the Ubp3Bre5 interface observed in the crystal structure we carried out structure-based mutagenesis. We initially prepared single alanine replacements of several Bre5 and Ubp3 residues shown to mediate protein­ protein interactions in the complex and used glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pull-down studies to compare the protein binding properties of these mutants. Specifically, using wild-type and single alanine GST-tagged Ubp3-Nterm mutants (L208, F209, I210, N211, T212, E216, F217 and R214), we carried out pull-down studies with the wild-type Bre5-NTF2 domain. We also carried out analogous pull-down studies with wild-type GST-Ubp3-Nterm and several single alanine His-Bre5-NTF2 mutants (Y17, K80, K82 and E105). As can be seen in Figure 4(a), only the single I210A Ubp3 mutation showed reduced binding relative to wild-type levels. Since the I210A Ubp3 mutation was not sufficient to abolish binding, we next prepared proteins containing multiple mutations and assayed protein binding using pull-down studies as described above. The results of these pull-down studies are shown in Figure 4(b) with a summary of the mutants that were tested and their binding properties in Table 2. Mutations of residues I208, F209, I210, N211 and F217 in Ubp3 in any combination significantly reduce binding to Bre5. Together, these results reinforce the structural findings that the 1­1 helix of Ubp3-Nterm plays an important role in Ubp3­Bre5 association. To obtain more quantitative information underlying the interaction between Upb3 and Bre5 we carried out an isothermal titration calorimetry study. For these studies we produced in bacteria a near fulllength Ubp3 construct that contained both the Bre5 interaction domain and the catalytic domain (residues 189­912) and the NTF2 domain of Bre5. This analysis revealed that Bre5 and Ubp3 interact very strongly with a dissociation constant of 119 nM (Figure 4(c)). We also prepared an Ubp3 (189­912) mutant containing alanine substitutions at the following residues: L208, F209, I210, N211 and F217 for ITC studies with the wild-type Bre5-NTF2 and could not detect binding using analogous conditions (Figure 4(c)). This comparison, in combination with our structural findings, reported here, is consistent with our conclusion that the 1­1 region of the Ubp3-Nterm is necessary and sufficient for tight Bre5 association. In an earlier study, we showed that the same NTF2 domain of Bre5 interacts with an N-terminal Ubp3 (181­282) construct with a dissociation constant of 187 nM, simlilar to that reported here but with a Bre5-NTF2­Ubp-Nterm stochiometry of 2:1 instead of the 1:1 stociometry reported here.17 Although the Bre5-NTF2 domain used in both studies is the same,

complex to mediate deubiquitylation of Sec23. As shown in Figure 4(d) and (e), expression of wildtype Bre5 or Ubp3 was able to form a complex with their endogenous counterpart and restore the deubiquitylation of Sec23 in bre5 and ubp3 cells, respectively. However, in agreement with the in vitro interaction studies (Figure 4(b)), a Bre5 mutant harboring both Y17A and K82A mutations displayed a modest (two- to threefold) but reproducible decrease in its binding to Ubp3 (Figure 4(d), top panel) and showed a fairly small, but detectable, decrease in sec23 deubiquitylation (Figure 4(e), top panel). In addition, the Ubp3 mutant harboring the L208A, F209A, I210A, and N211A substitutions was severely deficient in its interaction with Bre5 (Figure 4(d), bottom panel) and led to a more dramatic decrease in Sec23 deubiquitylation (Figure 4(e), bottom panel). Significantly, these in vivo results mirror the in vitro binding studies showing that both the Bre5 Y17A/K82A but mainly the Ubp3 L208A/F209A/ I210A/ N211A mutants decrease Bre5­Upb3 association (Figure 4(b) and Table 2). Taken together, these results demonstrate that association between Bre5 and Ubp3 through the interface defined in the crystal structure reported here is important for Ubp3 function in vivo. Comparison of the Bre5/Ubp3 interface to other protein complexes with NTF2 domains It is somewhat striking that the NTF2-like domains adopt highly homologous dimeric structures given the rather low but significant sequence homology (Figure 5). One potential reason for the low sequence homology may be due to the fact that different NTF2-like domains exploit this sequence divergence to interact with different cognate proteins. A comparison of the Ubp3­Bre5 complex reported here with other protein complexes with NTF2 and other NTF2-like domains reveals that this is indeed the case. Specifically, while Ran GTPase interacts with its cognate NTF2 dimer on the same "top" surface as Ubp3 of the NTF2 dimer, Ran GTPase uses two loop regions to interact with loop regions on the opposite face of the top surface of the NTF2 dimer (Figure 5(a) and (b)).18 Interestingly, the

TAP subunit of the TAP/P15 heterodimer contains an extra C-terminal helix that sits at the dimer interface of the top surface of the NTF2-like dimer contributing to specificity of the NTF2 domain heterodimer.15,16,19 In contrast, the nucleoporin FG repeat loop interacts with loops in the "bottom" surface of the TAP/P15 dimer (Figure 5(a) and (b)).13,15 Taken together, it appears that the NTF2like domains employ sequence divergence, predominantly within loop regions, on different surfaces to specifically associate with their cognate proteins. The Ubp3­Bre5 complex represents yet another example of how different NTF2-like domains form protein-specific recognition modules to modulate distinct biological processes.

Experimental Procedures
Protein preparation The Ubp3 gene was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and inserted into the pGEX5T expression vector. A construct encoding residues 190­233 of Ubp3 (Ubp3-Nterm) was sub-cloned by PCR into the PGEX4T-1 expression vector for the preparation of the GST-Ubp3(190233) fusion protein. The longer Ubp3(189­912) construct that includes both the N-terminal Bre5 binding domain and the catalytic deubiquitylation domain was sub-cloned by PCR into the pET28A expression vector for preparation of a C-terminal 6xHis fusion protein. DNA encoding residues 1­146 of Bre5 (Bre5-NTF2) was PCR amplified from yeast genomic DNA and sub-cloned into the pET28A expression vector for preparation of the 6x-His-Bre5(1­ 146) fusion protein. All Ubp3 and Bre5 expression plasmids were transformed or co-transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. Transformed bacteria were initially grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 0.7­0.9 at 600 nm, and protein was overexpressed by addition of 0.1 mM IPTG followed by overnight growth at 15 °C. Cells were disrupted by sonication in a solution containing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer supplemented with 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (BME) and 1 mM PMSF. For the purification of His-tagged fusion proteins, the respective protein was partially purified using a Ni-NTA resin as described by the manufacturer and further purified using cation exchange (SP-Sepharose) and gel

Bre5/Ubp3 Complex Structure

Figure 5. Comparison of the Bre5­Ubp3 complex with other protein complexes with NTF2-like domains. (a) The Bre5­Ubp3 complex (blue and red, respectively) is superimposed in ribbon representation with other protein complexes with NTF2-like domains including the human NTF2/Ran GTPase complex (cyan and orange), the human TAP/P15/FG repeat complex (green and purple). (b) A view from the top of (a). Only the NTF2-like domain of the Bre5 dimer is shown (in surface representation) for clarity. (c) Sequence alignment of the Bre5 NTF2­like domain with NTF2 and other NTF2like domains in (a). Strictly conserved residues are shaded in black and conservative substitutions are in grey. Secondary structural elements of S. cerivisea Bre5 are indicated above the sequence alignment and the dotted line indicates regions of disorder in the crystal structure of Bre5-NTF2 in the Ubp3 complex. Residues that have been shown to participate in protein interaction are color-coded according to the NTF2-like interacting proteins in (a).

filtration (Superdex-75) chromatography in PBS buffer. For purification of GST-Ubp3(190­233), the supernatant was partially purified using glutathione resin (Novagen) as described by the manufacturer. For preparation of the Ubp3-Nterm­Bre5-NTF2 complex for co-crystallization, the proteins were co-expressed of their expression plasmids in BL21 (DE3) cells as described above. The cell lysate was loaded onto a Ni-NTA resin (to capture the complex using the C-terminal 6xHistag on Bre5), washed with buffer (20 mM Hepes (pH7.0), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM BME) and eluted with a gradient of 15 mM­300 mM imidazole in the same buffer. Fractions containing Ubp3­Bre5 complex were loaded onto a GST resin (to capture the complex using the N-terminal GST tag on Upb3). Both the GST and 6x-His tags were removed by treating a slurry of the resin-bound complex with thrombin (10 units/ mg fused protein) overnight at 4 °C, and the untagged complex was eluted with buffer (20 mM Hepes (pH7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM BME). The

complex was further purified with gel filtration (Superdex-75) chromatography in the same buffer. Protein purity was judged to be greater than 90% by SDS­PAGE and the protein was concentrated to 10­20 mg/ml for crystallization. Site-directed protein mutants were prepared using the Quick Change Mutagenesis kit essentially as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene), the sequence of the mutants confirmed by sequencing and the mutant proteins were purified essentially as described for the wild-type protein proteins. Crystallization and structure determination Crystals of the Ubp3-Nterm­Bre5-NTF2 complex were grown at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Two l of protein solution at 14 mg/ml in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 10 mM BME and 150 mM NaCl

Bre5/Ubp3 Complex Structure was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 10% (w/v) PEG 20,000, 100 mM Bicine (pH 9.0), 2% (v/v) Dioxan and equilibrating over 0.5 ml of reservoir solution. Crystals grew to a typical size of 500 m ×100 m ×50 m over five days and were flash frozen in a reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol for storage in solid propane prior to data collection. Single wavelength native data were collected on beamline F1 at the CHESS using an ADSC Quantum-4 CCD detector at 100 K. The data were processed with the HKL 2000 suite (HKL Research Inc.) and the relevant statistics are summarized in Table 1. The structure of the complex was determined by molecular replacement with the program Molrep,20 using the Bre5(1-146) protein structure (PDB 1ZX2,17) as a search model. Model refinement employed simulated annealing and torsion angle dynamic refinement protocols in CNS with iterative manual adjustments of the model using the program O, with reference to 2Fo­Fc and Fo­Fc electron density maps. Solvent molecules were modeled into the electron density map using the programs CNS and ARP/wARP21,22 and the later stages of refinement was carried out using translation, liberation, and screw-rotation (TLS) and restraint refinement in the program REFMAC5.23 The final model was checked for errors with a compositesimulated annealing omit map and showed excellent refinement statistics and geometry (Table 1). In vitro Ubp3­Bre5 binding studies For pull-down assays, GST-Ubp3 (190­233) protein (50 M in PBS buffer) was incubated with purified HisBre5(1­146) (50 M in PBS buffer) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by immobilization on 30 l glutathione­ Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml PBS buffer and 5­10 l aliquots were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-loading buffer and analyzed on SDS­PAGE. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) measurements were carried out using a MicroCal VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc) and each experiment was carried out in duplicate. Wild-type or mutated Ubp3 (189­912) was diluted to 30 M in PBS buffer and added to a 1.4 ml sample cell, and a 0.3 mM solution of wildtype Bre5(1­146) protein titrant was loaded into the injection syringe. For each titration experiment, a 60 s delay at the start of the experiment was followed by 30 injections of 10 l of the titrant solution. The sample cell was stirred at 300 rpm throughout and maintained at 15 °C. Titration data were analyzed using the Origin 5.0 software supplied by MicroCal Inc. and data sets were corrected for baseline heats of dilutions from control runs as appropriate. The corrected data were then fit to a theoretical titration curve describing one binding site per titrant. The area under each peak of the resultant heat profile was integrated and plotted against the molar ratio of Ubp3 to Bre5. A non-linear best-fit binding isotherm for the data was used to calculate Ubp3/Bre5 stoichiometry, dissociation constant and standard enthalpy change. In vivo analysis of Sec23 ubiquitylation state Yeast cultures were grown either in rich medium (YPD; Q-Biogen) or in minimal medium (SD) containing 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate, 2% (w/v) dextrose, and supplemented with appropriate nutrients. Yeast transformations were performed using standard procedures and preparation of the Bre5 and Ubp3

strains were as described.11 The point mutations in Bre5His Y17K82A and Ubp3-His L208F209I210N211A were prepared with appropriate primers, p426-ADH-Bre5-His and p423-ADH-Ubp3-His plasmids as template, respectively and the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Yeast cells grown in YPD or minimal medium were collected during the exponential growth phase (A600 nm of 2 or 0.8, respectively). Total protein extracts were prepared by the NaOH-TCA lysis method.10 Protein samples were separated by SDS­7% (w/v)PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, probed with appropriate antibodies, and detected with chemiluminescence protein immunoblotting reagents (Pierce). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Sec23p (1:400 dilution), were kindly provided by B. Lesch and R. Schekman, and mouse monoclonal antibody antiHis was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments Yeast cells were grown up to an A600 = 1.2. Cells were harvested and lysed at 4 °C with glass beads in ice-cold IP buffer.10 The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 13,000g. The supernatant was incubated with protein G­Sepharose beads (Amersham) and antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed with IP buffer and bound proteins were eluted by heating samples at 95 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer before Western-blot analysis using anti-HA (Babco), anti-His (Santa Cruz) or anti-GFP (Roche) antibodies. Protein Data Bank accession code Coordinates for the Ubp3(190-233)/Bre(1-146) complex structure have been deposited to the Rutgers Collaborative Structural Bioinfomatics database under accession code 2QIY.
