ABSTRACT: General transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is recruited to the preinitiation complex (PIC) through direct interactions between its p62 (Tfb1) subunit and the carboxyl-terminal domain of TFIIER. TFIIH has also been shown to interact with a number of transcriptional activator proteins through interactions with the same p62 (Tfb1) subunit. We have determined the NMR solution structure of the amino-terminal domain from the Tfb1 subunit of yeast TFIIH (Tfb11-115). Like the corresponding domain from the human p62 protein, Tfb11-115 contains a PH domain fold despite a low level of sequence identity between the two functionally homologous proteins. In addition, we have performed in vitro binding studies that demonstrate that the PH domains of Tfb1 and p62 specifically bind to monophosphorylated inositides [PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns(3)P]. NMR chemical shift mapping demonstrated that the PtdIns(5)P binding site on Tfb1 (p62) is located in the basic pocket formed by -strands 5- 7 of the PH domain fold. Interestingly, the structural composition of the PtdIns(5)P binding site is different from the composition of the binding sites for phosphoinositides on prototypic PH domains. We have also determined that the PH domains from Tfb1 and p62 are sufficient for binding to the activation domain of VP16. NMR chemical shift mapping demonstrated that the VP16 binding site within the PH domain of Tfb1 (p62) overlaps with the PtdIns(5)P binding site on Tfb1 (p62). These results provide new information about the recognition of phosphoinositides by PH domains, and point to a potential role for phosphoinositides in VP16 regulation.

The assembly of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II)1 and the general transcription factors (GTFs) required for basal transcription onto a DNA promoter is termed the transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) (1). The GTFs include TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, TFIIH, and, in many cases, TFIIA (1).

RNAP II differs from RNAP I and RNAP III in that its largest subunit possesses a distinct repeating heptapeptide unit with the consensus sequence Y-S-P-T-S-P-S that defines its carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) (2, 3). To be recruited to the PIC, the CTD of RNAP II must be in the unphosphorylated form. The CTD of RNAP II is then extensively phosphorylated during the initiation phase of the transcription process, before the start of the elongation (4, 5). A number of nuclear kinases have been reported to phosphorylate the CTD of RNAP II, including the cdk7 (Kin28) subunit of TFIIH (6). Originally discovered in humans, TFIIH has also been identified in yeast (factor b), and the subunits of yeast and human TFIIH are highly homologous (7, 8). TFIIH is composed of 10 subunits, and it is the only GTF that displays enzymatic activity, including DNA-dependent ATPase (9), ATP-dependent DNA helicase (10), and CTD kinase activities (6). Yeast and human TFIIH are highly homologous in both structure and function, and the subunits can be grouped into two subcomplexes termed the core and CAK subcomplexes. The core subcomplex consists of XPB (Ssl2), p62 (Tfb1), p52 (Tfb2), p44 (Ssl1), p34 (Tfb4), and TTDA (Tfb5), whereas the CAK subcomplex contains cdk7 (Kin28), cyclin H (Ccl1), and MAT1 (Tfb3) in humans (yeast components in parentheses). The two complexes are linked by the XPD (Rad3) subunit (7, 8).

NMR Studies of the Amino-Terminal Domain of Tfb1 TFIIH is recruited to the PIC through interactions between its p62 (Tfb1) subunit and the acid-rich carboxyl-terminal domain of TFIIER. This interaction leads to a marked increase in the extent of phosphorylation of the CTD of RNAP II by the cdk7 subunit of TFIIH (11). TFIIH has also been shown to interact with a number of activators through direct interactions with its p62 (Tfb1) subunit. Both p62 and Tfb1 have been shown to interact with the transcriptional activation domains (TADs) from VP16, p53, E2F-1, and the HIV-1 Tat protein (12-14). Interestingly, the interaction of these TADs with p62 (Tfb1) correlates with their ability to stimulate initiation and elongation (13). The structure of the amino-terminal domain of p62 (p621-108) has recently been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and shown to contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain fold (15). In this paper, we describe the NMR structure of the amino-terminal domain from the Tfb1 (Tfb11-115) subunit of yeast TFIIH. Tfb11-115 contains a PH domain that is very similar to the PH domain of p621-108, which is consistent with the fact that these two proteins carry out homologous functions in yeast and humans. In addition, we have performed in vitro binding studies demonstrating that the PH domains of Tfb1 and p62 specifically bind to monophosphorylated inositides [PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns(3)P]. We used NMR chemical shift mapping to identify the binding pocket of PtdIns(5)P and VP16 on Tfb11-115. Interestingly, we found considerable overlap between the VP16 binding site and the binding site for PtdIns(5)P. Our results provide new structural information about the recognition of acidic TADs involved in transcriptional regulation, and suggest a potential role for phosphoinositides in VP16 regulation. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cloning of Recombinant Proteins. The GST-p621-127 fragment was generated by starting with the GST-p621-548 DNA from the pGEX-2T (Amersham) vector (gift from J. Laadias, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) and creating a blunt end at amino acid 127. The GST-Tfb11-115 fragment was inserted into a pGEX-2T plasmid vector. The GSTVP16412-456 fragment was generously donated by S. Triezenberg (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI). Expression and Purification of Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Proteins. The GST-Tfb11-115 and GSTp621-127 proteins used in the in vitro binding experiments were expressed in Escherichia coli host strain TOPP2 (Stratagene). The cells were grown at 37 °C, and protein expression was induced for 3 h at 30 °C with 0.7 mM isopropyl D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in EBC buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, and 2 mM DTT]. The cells were then lysed by being passed through a French press and centrifuged at 100,000g for 45 min. The supernatant from the centrifugation was incubated for 1 h with 3 mL of glutathione-Sepharose (GSH) resin (Amersham) at 4 °C. Following incubation, the resin was collected by centrifugation and washed twice with NETN buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.05% SDS, and 1 mM DTT] and once in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) (10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 140 mM NaCl, and 3 mM KCl). The fusion protein

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 21, 2005 7679 was eluted off the resin by rotating for 10 min in elution buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 15 mM reduced glutathione]. The eluted fusion protein was dialyzed into freezing buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 2 mM DTT] and stored at -80 °C. Protein Expression and Purification for NMR Studies. Tfb11-115 and p621-127 were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli host strain TOPP2. Uniform (>98%) 15N-labeling and 15N/13C-labeling were obtained by growing the cells in a modified minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and [12C6]glucose or [13C6]-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. The cells were grown at 37 °C and induced for 4 h with 0.7 mM IPTG at 30 °C. The proteins were cleaved from the GST tag with thrombin, and the purification procedure was essentially identical to the procedure used for purifying the carboxyl-terminal domain of RAP74 (16). The GST-VP16412-456 fragment was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli host strain TOPP2. The cells were grown at 37 °C, and protein expression was induced for 4 h with 0.7 mM IPTG at 30 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in GST lysis buffer [20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA, 1 M NaCl, and 1 mM DTT], lysed by being passed through a French press, and centrifuged at 100,000g for 45 min. The supernatant was incubated for 1 h with 10 mL of GSH resin at 4 °C. Following incubation, the resin was washed with lysis buffer three times followed by equilibration with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM DTT. The resin containing the bound fusion protein was then incubated overnight at 25 °C with 100 units of factor Xa (Calbiochem) to cut the VP16412-456 fragment from the GST. Following enzyme cleavage, the supernatant was incubated for 1 h with benzamidine-Sepharose (Amersham), filtered to remove the benzamidine-Sepharose, dialyzed into buffer A [20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA], and then applied to a Q-Sepharose High Performance (Amersham) column (75 mL) equilibrated with buffer A. The VP16412-456 fragment was eluted from the column using a gradient (from 0 to 100% over 700 mL) of buffer B [20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 M NaCl]. Fractions containing purified VP16412-456 were then pooled, dialyzed overnight into buffer A, and concentrated for NMR studies. Samples for NMR Spectroscopy. The NMR samples were as follows. (1) For studies of the structure of free Tfb11-115, the sample consisted of 1.2 mM Tfb11-115 (unlabeled, 15Nlabeled, and 15N/13C-labeled) in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 1 mM EDTA (100% D2O or 90% H2O/10% D2O). (2) For titration of Tfb11-115 with dihexanoyl-PtdIns(5)P (Echelon), the sample consisted of 0.3 mM Tfb11-115 (15N-labeled) in 2.5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 1 mM EDTA (90% H2O/10% D2O). PtdIns(5)P was added in increments from 0 to 0.45 mM. (3) For the studies of p621-127 with Ins(1,5)P2, the sample consisted of 0.3 mM p621-127 (15N-labeled) in 0.5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA (90% H2O/10% D2O). Ins(1,5)P2 was added in increments from 0 to 0.45 mM. (4) For titration of Tfb11-115 with VP16412-456, the sample consisted of 0.3 mM Tfb11-115 (15N-labeled) in 2.5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 1 mM EDTA (90% H2O/ 10% D2O). VP16412-456 was added in increments from 0 to

(5) For titration of p621-127 with VP16412-456, the sample consisted of 0.3 mM p621-127 (15N-labeled) in 2.5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA (90% H2O/10% D2O). VP16412-456 was added in increments from 0 to 0.3 mM. (6) For titration of Tfb11-115 with dibutanoyl-PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Echelon), the sample consisted of 0.3 mM Tfb11-115 (15N-labeled) in 2.5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 1 mM EDTA (90% H2O/10% D2O). PtdIns(3,5)P2 was added in increments from 0 to 0.6 mM. (7) For titration of Tfb11-115 with Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (Echelon), the sample consisted of 0.3 mM Tfb11-115 (15N-labeled) in 2.5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 1 mM EDTA (90% H2O/10% D2O). Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was added in increments from 0 to 0.6 mM. NMR Spectroscopy. NMR spectra were collected at 300 K on Varian Unity Inova 500, 600, and 800 MHz NMR spectrometers equipped with z pulsed-field gradient units and triple-resonance probes. The backbone and aliphatic side chain resonances (1H, 15N, and 13C) were assigned using a combination of NMR experiments as previously described (16). Distance restraints were obtained from two- and threedimensional NOESY experiments (17-20). The NMR data were processed with NMRPipe/NMRDraw (21) and analyzed with NMRView (22). The dissociation constants (Kd) were estimated from the changes in both 1H and 15N chemical shifts as observed in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of Tfb11-115 upon binding to PtdIns(5)P or VP16412-456. The chemical shift changes, measured at various Tfb11-115/ligand ratios, were plotted versus the ligand concentration, and the results were fitted by nonlinear regression according to the following equation (23, 24):

Based on PROCHECK-NMR analysis (29). Only residues 4-64 and 85-112 were used for the rmsd calculation. Residues at the N-terminus (1-3), at the C-terminus (113-115), and in flexible loop (65-84) were not included in the calculation.

The bound protein was incubated with anti-GSTHRP conjugate RPN1236 antibody (Amersham), and bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL-Plus kit (Amersham). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Tfb11-115 Structure. The three-dimensional structure of Tfb11-115 was determined using a set of 1208 NOE-derived distance restraints [249 intraresidue, 569 medium-range (|i - j| e 4), and 390 long-range (|i - j| > 4)], 20 hydrogenbond restraints, and 124 dihedral angle ( and ) restraints (Table 1). The 20 hydrogen bond restraints were derived from the slowly exchanging amide protons. Dihedral angle restraints were obtained from analysis of 1HR, 15N, 13CR, 13C , and 13C chemical shifts using TALOS (32). The dihedral angle restraints derived from TALOS are set as  ( error (or  ( error), where the value of the errors used for structure calculations (from 20° to 50°) is twice that obtained from the TALOS analysis. Starting from an extended model of Tfb11-115, 62 structures were calculated and 50 were accepted because they had no distance restraint violation greater that 0.2 Å and no dihedral angle restraint violation greater than 2°. Among the 50 accepted structures, the 20 conformers with the lowest energies were selected for further analysis (Table 1). Tfb11-115 presents the typical architecture of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (33, 34), consisting of two -sheets and one long amphipatic R-helix at the carboxyl terminus (Figure 1A). The backbone superimposition of the 20 lowestenergy NMR structures of Tfb11-115 is reported in Figure 1A. The pairwise rmsd for the ensemble, in the regions defined by residues 4-64 and 85-112, is 0.40 ( 0.07 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.19 ( 0.08 Å for all the heavy atoms. The first -sheet (sheet A) is formed by strands 1 (residues 4-9), 2 (residues 12-19), 3 (residues 26-31), and 4 (residues 36-41). Strands 1 and 2 are connected

Structure Calculation. Structures were calculated using the torsion angle molecular dynamics (TAD) protocol of CNS (26) starting from one extended structure with standard geometry. The protocol employed the conformational database potential derived from structure databases (27, 28). From a total of 62 calculated structures, 50 of them satisfied all the experimental constraints with no NOE violation greater than 0.2 Å and no TALOS-derived dihedral angle ( and ) violations greater than 2°. The quality of the structures was analyzed using PROCHECK-NMR (29) and MOLMOL (30). All figures representing structures were generated using MOLMOL (30) and GRASP (31). Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Binding Studies. Phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) strips (Echelon) were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 3% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma). The strips were then incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with purified GST, the GST-Tfb11-115 fusion protein, or the GST-p621-127 fusion protein at a final protein concentration of 0.5 µg/mL in TBS containing 3% fatty acid free BSA. Following the incubation, the unbound protein was removed, and the strips were washed three times with TBS containing

by a I turn (residues 9-12), whereas two loops (residues 20-25 and 32-35) connect strands 2 and 3 and 3 and 4, respectively. The second -sheet (sheet B) consists of three strands spanning residues 47-50 ( 5), 59-64 ( 6), and 85-91 ( 7). Strands 5 and 6 are joined by an eightresidue loop (residues 51-58), whereas strands 6 and 7 are linked by a long unstructured loop (residues 65-84). A comparison of the Tfb11-115 structure with other PH domain structures revealed some variations in the prototypic PH scaffold. The major difference in PH domains is usually found in the composition of the three variable loops (VL1VL3) connecting strands 1 and 2 (VL1), 3 and 4 (VL2), and 6 and 7 (VL3) (35-37). In most PH domains, the loop connecting 1 and 2 (VL1) is six or more residues and it is rich in basic amino acids. In Tfb11-115, this loop is a four-residue turn that contains only one basic residue (Lys11). The other difference between Tfb1 and other PH domains occurs in the loop connecting strands 6 and 7 (VL3). Tfb11-115 contains a very long (20 residues) and flexible loop that is highly basic. In fact, almost all of the amino acids in this region have 15N-1H heteronuclear NOE values in the range of 0.13-0.40 (data not shown), indicating a high degree of backbone motion on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale. Long flexible loops such as this between 6 and 7 are rare in PH domains. In the case of Grp1 (general receptor for phosphoinositides-1), the corresponding loop is 26 residues long, but it is arranged in a twisted -hairpin that extends the -barrel from seven to nine strands (38). Comparison of the Solution Structures of Yeast Tfb1 and Human p62. The solution structure of the amino-terminal

domain of the human p62 subunit of TFIIH (p621-108) has recently been reported (15). Despite the low level of sequence identity (17.4%) in the first 120 amino acids (39), Tfb11-115 and p621-108 share the PH domain fold. The overlay between the backbone atoms (CR, C, and N) for residues in the secondary structure elements of the two proteins is 2.16 Å (data not shown). A feature peculiar to Tfb11-115 is the long flexible loop (residues 65-84) between 6 and 7 (VL3) which is replaced, in p62, by a four-residue turn. Overall, the yeast and human PH domains are very similar, and the major difference is the length of the connecting loop between 6 and 7. Interaction of Tfb1 with Monophosphorylated Phosphoinositides. Like other PH domains, Tfb11-115 contains a positively charged surface on one face (Figure 2). Generally, the positively charged face enables PH domains to interact with phosphoinositides and/or negatively charged membranes (33). PH domains bind phosphoinositides with various affinities and specificities through interactions with the three positively charged variable loops (VL1-VL3) (36, 37, 4042). For PH domains that bind with low affinity and specificity, phosphoinositide binding seems to be driven almost exclusively by nonspecific electrostatic interactions, and binding affinities correlate more with the number of phosphate groups than with their spatial arrangements (37). PH domains that bind with high affinity and specificity can be divided into subgroups on the basis of their selectivity for either PtdIns(4,5)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Those that bind better to 3-phosphoinositides that are products of the PI 3-kinase [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2] have also been shown to contain a characteristic sequence motif involving

Di Lello et al. are not surprising given the structures of the PH domains of Tfb1 and p62. First, the PH domains of Tfb1 and p62 contain a positively charged face, but it is located in a different part of the fold from that of other PH domains. Second, the PH domains of Tfb1 and p62 lack the characteristic motif centered around VL1 that enables other PH domains to bind 3-phosphoinositide substrates with high affinity and specificity (38, 43). To map the phosphoinositide binding site of Tfb1 and to estimate the dissociation constant (Kd), we used NMR titration experiments to monitor the interaction between Tfb11-115 and PtdIns(5)P (42). Upon progressive additions of PtdIns(5)P to the free Tfb11-115, we observed continuous changes in 1H and 15N chemical shifts for several signals of Tfb11-115 in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra (Figure 4A). These chemical shift changes indicated the formation of a complex [Tfb11-115-PtdIns(5)P] in intermediate to fast exchange on the NMR time scale. The Kd for the Tfb11-115-PtdIns(5)P complex was estimated to be between 0.1 and 0.6 µM after analysis of the NMR titration curves of several Tfb1 residues (23, 24). The residues from Tfb11-115 that showed the most significant changes in 1H and 15N chemical shifts upon formation of the complex { > 0.1 ppm;  ) [(0.17NH)2 + (HN)2]1/2} (25) (Figure 4B) were mapped onto the NMR solution structure of Tfb11-115, revealing a novel mode of interaction of a PH domain with phosphoinositides (Figure 4C). The residues most affected by PtdIns(5)P binding are located in strand 5 (A50), strand 6 (M59, L60, R61, and L62), strand 7 (H87, M88, F89, S90, and F91), and the loop between 5 and 6 (T51). The PtdIns(5)P binding site comprising 5- 7 and the loop between 5 and 6 is within the highly positively charged face of Tfb11-115 (Figures 2 and 4C), and this indicates that ionic interactions play an important role in the binding as expected. However, it is clear that other structural determinants must play a role in the interaction of Tfb11-115 with phosphoinositides, especially considering the high specificity with which Tfb11-115 recognizes PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns(3)P. We also studied the interaction of p621-127 with phosphoinositides by NMR. Because of solubility problems of p621-127 in the presence of PtdIns(5)P, we examined the interaction of p621-127 with Ins(1,5)P2, the soluble headgroup of PtdIns(5)P. Again, we observed changes in both 1H and 15 N chemical shifts in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of p621-127 upon addition of Ins(1,5)P2 (Supporting Information Figure S1A) (42). We found that the residues displaying significant chemical shift changes cluster in a region that is centered on strands 5- 7 and in the loop between 5 and 6 (Figure 4D). On the basis of the structure of the PH domain of p62, it was predicted that a positively charged face involving lysine residues 60 and 62 in the loop between 5 and 6 as well as lysine residues 93 and 104 in the R-helix may be involved in ligand binding since these four lysines are highly conserved (15). The prediction of lysine 60 and 62 being involved is in agreement with our experimental results; however, the lysine residues in the R-helix (93 and 104) do not contribute to the binding of Ins(1,5)P2. Therefore, the PH domains of Tfb1 and p62 not only have the same structural scaffold but also seem to share a recognition site for phosphoinositides. Interestingly, the PtdIns(5)P binding site on both Tfb1 and p62 appears to be unique among PH domains that bind phosphoinositides (see

FIGURE 3: In vitro binding with PIP strips demonstrates that Tfb11-115 and p621-127 bind to monophosphorylated inositides. PIP strip blots (Echelon Biosciences) were incubated with (A) 1 µM GST-Tfb11-115 (B) 1 µM GST-p621-127, or (C) 1 µM GST. Each strip contains the 16 PIP analogues denoted at either side of the figure. Following washing to remove nonspecific binding, the bound proteins were detected with anti-GST-HRP conjugate (Amersham Biosciences): LA, lysophosphatidic acid; LPC, lysophosphocholine; PE, phosphatidylcholine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; SIP, sphingosine 1-phosphate; PA, phosphatidic acid; PS, phosphatidylcholine.

residues located in 1 and 2 and in the loop between them (VL1) (43). In Tfb11-115, the positively charged face is not centered around these three variable loops such as in prototypic PH domains, but rather, it is spread over strands 5- 7 of sheet B (Figure 2). Thus, it is clear that Tfb11-115 contains a positively charged face as seen in other PH domains, but within a distinctly different location. Therefore, we examined the in vitro properties of Tfb1 (Tfb11-115) and p62 (p621-127) for binding to a series of phosphoinositides using a PIP strip assay. Tfb1 and p62 demonstrated preferential binding to monophosphorylated inositides, specifically, PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns(3)P (Figure 3), and unlike other PH domains, they failed to recognize either PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. In this regard, the binding properties of Tfb1 and p62 appear to be unique among the PH domains interacting with phosphoinositides. These results

Biochemistry, Vol. 44, No. 21, 2005 7683 Interaction of Tfb1 with Polyphosphorylated Phosphoinositides. To examine the interaction of Tfb1 with polyphosphorylated phosphoinositides, NMR titration experiments with Tfb11-115 and PtdIns(3,5)P2 and with Tfb11-115 and Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were performed (42). In the PIP strip assay, PtdIns(3,5)P2 was the only polyphosphorylated phosphoinositide that demonstrated binding to Tfb11-115 and p621-127. Upon progressive additions of PtdIns(3,5)P2 to 15N-labeled Tfb11-115, we observed changes in 1H and 15N chemical shifts for several signals of Tfb11-115 in the two-dimensional 1H15 N HSQC spectra. These chemical shift changes indicated the formation of a complex [Tfb11-115-PtdIns(3,5)P2] in intermediate to fast exchange on the NMR time scale. The Kd for the Tfb11-115-PtdIns(3,5)P2 complex was estimated to be between 9 and 17 µM after analysis of the NMR titration curves of several Tfb11-115 residues (23, 24). As was the case for PtdIns(5)P, the residues that showed the most significant changes in 1H and 15N chemical shifts upon formation of the Tfb11-115-PtdIns(3,5)P2 complex { > 0.1 ppm;  ) [(0.17NH)2 + (HN)2]1/2} (25) are located in strands 5- 7 and in the loop between 5 and 6 (Supporting Information Figure S2A). This demonstrates that the binding site for PtdIns(3,5)P2 is the same as the binding site for PtdIns(5)P. However, the affinity of Tfb11-115 appears lower for PtdIns(3,5)P2 than for PtdIns(5)P (Kd values of 9-17 µM and 0.1-0.6 µM, respectively). Likewise, progressive additions of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were made to the free Tfb11-115, and changes in 1H and 15N chemical shifts of Tfb11-115 were monitored in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra. In the titration with Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, we failed to observe significant changes in 1H and 15N chemical shifts of Tfb11-115 that were indicative of formation of a specific complex { > 0.1 ppm;  ) [(0.17NH)2 + (HN)2]1/2} (25) (Supporting Information Figure S2B). These findings are consistent with the result from the PIP strip assay indicating that Tfb11-115 has a preference for monophosphorylated phosphoinositides, but that it also binds PtdIns(3,5)P2. In addition, our NMR studies with the polyphosphorylated phosphoinositides verify that PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(5)P share a common binding site which is distinct from the prototypic PH domain phosphoinositide binding site involving the three variable loops, VL1-VL3 (36, 37). Interaction of Tfb1 and p62 with VP16. Both p62 and Tfb1 have been shown to interact with the TADs from VP16, p53, E2F-1, the estrogen receptor, and the HIV-1 Tat protein (1214). Interestingly, a number of VP16 TAD mutants have been examined, and mutations within the amino-teminal subdomain of the VP16 TAD (VP16412-456) appeared to affect significantly both transcriptional activation and binding of VP16 to Tfb1 (p62) (13, 44). In addition, it has been demonstrated that the amino-terminal domain of p62 is required for interaction with the estrogen receptor (45). Therefore, we were interested in determining if the PH domains of Tfb1 and p62 were capable of binding specifically to VP16412-456. We used NMR chemical shift mapping to study the interaction of Tfb11-115 and p621-127 with VP16412-456. Stepwise additions of VP16412-456 to either Tfb11-115 or p621-127 resulted in continuous changes in 1H and 15N chemical shifts for several signals of Tfb11-115 and p621-127 in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra (Figure 5A and Supporting Information Figure S1B). This again indi-

To our knowledge, all of the other PH domains that interact with phosphoinositides have a characteristic binding site that comprises the variable loops connecting strands 1 and 2 (VL1), 3 and 4 (VL2), and 6 and 7 (VL3) which are located on a different face of the PH domain from strands 5- 7 and in the loop between 5 and 6 (37).

FIGURE 6: Cartoon highlighting the potential competitive binding between the activation domain of VP16412-456 (VP16) and the monophosphorylated phosphoinositide PtdIns(5)P (PIP) for the PH domain of Tfb1 (TFB1).

binding site on Tfb11-115 (p621-108) (Figure 5C, D) is virtually identical to that of PtdIns(5)P (Figure 4C, D). To our knowledge, this is the first example demonstrating that the phosphoinositide-binding region of a PH domain could also participate in specific protein-protein interactions. These findings suggest that VP16412-456 and PtdIns(5)P could compete for binding to the PH domain of Tfb1 (p62) (Figure 6). CONCLUSION

cated the formation of complexes (Tfb11-115-VP16412-456 and p621-127-VP16412-456) in intermediate to fast exchange on the NMR time scale. The Kd for the Tfb1-VP16412-456 complex was estimated to be between 4 and 7 µM after analysis of the NMR titration curves of several Tfb11-115 residues (23, 24). The residues that exhibited the most significant changes in 1H and 15N chemical shifts upon formation of both complexes with VP16412-456 { > 0.1 ppm;  ) [(0.17NH)2 + (HN)2]1/2} (25) were located in the regions of strands 5- 7 and in the loop between 5 and 6 (Figure 5B). When mapped onto the NMR solution structure of Tfb11-115 (p621-108), the residues displaying significant chemical shift changes revealed that the VP16412-456

In this work, we have determined the NMR solution structure of Tfb11-115, and we have used NMR methods to map the binding sites for both phosphoinositides and the TAD of VP16. The Tfb1 binding sites of both phosphoinositides and the TAD of VP16 are located on the positively charged face of the PH domain formed within strands 57 and in the loop between 5 and 6 (Figures 4 and 5). Our biochemical and NMR studies have demonstrated that Tfb11-115 and p621-127 preferentially bind to monophosphorylated phosphoinositides [PtdIns(5)P and PtdIns(3)P]. The phosphoinositide binding site in Tfb1 (p62) also appears to be distinct from that of the prototypic PH domain. Furthermore, the phosphoinositide binding site in Tfb1 (p62) is distinct from that of other protein domains that bind phosphoinositides such as the ENTH domains, the FYVE domains, and the phox homology (PX) domains (36, 48). Our results also suggest that the acidic activation domains of VP16412-456 may compete with PtdIns(5)P for binding to the Tfb1 (p62) subunit of TFIIH. Phosphoinositides are a diverse group of small molecule cellular regulators that originate from the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol (48-50), and have been implicated in regulating a number of important biological functions (50). It is clear that there is a nuclear phosphoinositide signaling network and that phosphoinositides play an important role in transcriptional regulation (51, 52). In

NMR Studies of the Amino-Terminal Domain of Tfb1 addition, the concentration of various phosphoinositide analogues in the nucleus varies dramatically from one stage of the cell cycle to another (53). Recently, the chromatinassociated protein ING2 was shown to bind phosphoinositides through its PHD domain zinc finger (51). Interestingly, ING2 shows the same specificity for binding to phosphoinositides as Tfb1 and p62 (51). Extensive studies with ING2 demonstrated that PtdIns(5)P was the in vivo target of ING2 and that binding of PtdIns(5)P to ING2 regulates the activation of p53 by ING2 and p53-dependent apoptotic pathways (51). We are currently carrying out additional NMR experiments to obtain three-dimensional structures of the Tfb11-115PtdIns(5)P and Tfb11-115-VP16412-456 complexes. The structures will allow us to further investigate the unusual mode of phosphoinositide recognition by the Tfb1 PH domain and how PtdIns(5)P and acidic TADs recognize the same binding site within this PH domain.
