ABSTRACT Asparaginyl deamidation is a common form of nonenzymatic degradation of proteins and peptides. As it introduces a negative charge spontaneously and irreversibly, charge heterogeneity can be accumulated in protein solution during purification, preservation, and experiments. In this study, canine milk lysozyme (CML), a useful model for the study of the molten globule state, exhibited charge heterogeneity after sample purification. Four Asn residues in CML deamidated rapidly under mild conditions: pH 8.0 and 308C. Other than these residues, one Asn residue, which was stable in the native state, was labile to deamidation in the unfolded state. This suggests that the structural formation around Asn can suppress deamidation. Substitutions of these labile Asn residues to Gln residues prevented deamidation effectively. Because the substitutions did not disrupt the structural formation of the native and molten globule states, they will enable more precise analyses for physical and structural studies.

INTRODUCTION C-type lysozyme/a-lactalbumin superfamily proteins have been used as model proteins in crystallography, enzymology, immunology, and so on. Canine milk lysozyme (CML), a member of the C-type lysozyme family, forms a partially unfolded state, molten globule (MG) state at equilibrium.1 Because this state is considered equivalent to a kinetic folding intermediate, it gives us clues to illuminate the folding pathway with equilibrium experiments.2­6 The MG state of CML is thermodynamically highly stable compared with those of other lysozymes, such as equine milk lysozyme, as well as those of a-lactalbumins, proteins whose MG formations are better known.1,7 However, the study of CML's physical and biological nature is hampered by the fact that charge heterogeneity is generated in CML during sample preparation. Grobler et al.8 reported that lysozyme derived from dog milk was eluted in three peaks as a result of cation-exchange separation, and that all these components had the activities and sizes of lysozymes. Recombinant CML prepared by the E. coli expression system9 also showed heterogeneous components. Furthermore, during prolonged storage of purified CML in solution, heterogeneous components increased obviously. This charge heterogeneity has not been characterized in detail so far. Considering the aspects of the heterogeneity of CML, we assumed that asparaginyl deamidation occurred in CML. Nonenzymatic asparaginyl deamidation, a common post-translational modification, introduces a negative charge by transforming an Asn residue into an Asp or isoAsp residue. It has been detected in many proteins and peptides under physiological conditions in vitro, and can have a significant effect on their behavior.10 Asparaginyl deamidation requires deprotonation of the carboxyl-side backbone amide, as shown in Figure 1.11,12 The deamidation reactivity depends on the type of residue immediately C-terminal to the Asn residue.13­15 Asn-Gly and Asn-Ser sequences are generally known to be highly labile. In contrast, many previous studies have reported that deamidation can also occur primarily at other sequences.16­18 These reports suggest that secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures around the

The currently accepted mechanism of asparagine nonenzymatic deamidation.11,12 The succinimide intermediate formation arises from a nucleophilic attack of the backbone NH group of the next residue on the sidechain carbonyl of the asparaginyl residue. The ring is hydrolyzed to open, resulting in either an aspartic acid or isoaspartic acid product.

sequence was constructed according to the previous study.24 Site-directed mutagenesis of CML on pPIC3 plasmid (Invitrogen) was performed using the QuickChange1 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutated plasmids were linearized with the restriction enzyme Sac I. The linearized plasmids were transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115 by electroporation. CML wild type and all of the mutants were prepared using the expression system of Pichia pastoris, basically as previously described.24 The samples were purified with cation-exchange chromatography (SP Sepharose Fast Flow, Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ) and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (5C18 AR-300, Nacalai Tesque, Tokyo, Japan). The sample solutions were dialyzed, lyophilized, and preserved at 2208C.
Deamidation experiments

Asn residue would modulate the rate of deamidation. Still, there are no sufficient data to quantify the effects of higherorder structures on deamidation. In the case of C-type lysozyme, asparaginyl deamidation of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) has been characterized as a model for protein spontaneous degradation.19­23 Asparaginyl deamidation at Asn 103 was reported to take place considerably at pH 4­8, 1008C,19,20 and slightly in 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 8.0, 408C.21 In contrast to the case of HEWL, the charge heterogeneity observed in CML is likely to proceed rapidly and complexly under mild conditions. If this heterogeneity is caused by asparaginyl deamidation, CML would be exceptionally susceptible to deamidation. As far as we know, no C-type lysozyme with such reactivity toward deamidation has ever been reported. In this article, detailed experiments were performed to determine whether the heterogeneity of CML was caused by nonenzymatic asparaginyl deamidation. We have characterized the deamidation of CML under various conditions and clearly determined the labile Asn residues by introducing mutageneses into CML. Because CML has a number of Asn residues prone to deamidation, it could, like HEWL, be a model for the study of deamidation. In addition, we have constructed a CML mutant that has no labile Asn residue. The substitution of labile Asn residues to Gln residues is helpful for preventing the generation of heterogeneity.

Protein dissolved at 1 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM CaCl2 was incubated at 308C, unless otherwise stated. An aliquot of the solution was sampled at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 days after incubation and frozen at 2808C until chromatography analysis. The solutions at lower pH were incubated with 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) containing 1 mM CaCl2. Cation-exchange (CE) chromatography was performed to detect the deamidated components of the incubated samples. A column of HiTrap SP (Amersham Bioscience) was equilibrated with binding buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0). After sample adsorption, the sample was eluted with elution buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 1M sodium chloride, pH 6.0) with a gradient of 0.5%/min. Column effluent was monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm and electric conductivity.

Crystallization, data collection, and refinements

Crystals of the CML N44/47/49/68/103Q (5NQ) mutant were prepared by hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 208C. Then, 20 mg/mL CML solution with 20 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.6) was mixed 1:1 with a reservoir solution of 5% iso-propanol, 2M ammonium sulfate, and 10% ethylene glycol. The crystals belong to the space group P32 with cell ° ° dimensions of a 5 31.26 A and c 5 198.31 A. There are two monomeric molecules in an asymmetric unit. Diffraction data from a crystal were collected at 93 K using a MicroMAX-007 generator (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) and an R-AXIS IV11 detector (Rigaku). The observed reflections between ° 2.01 and 66.08 A were integrated, scaled, and merged using the HKL-2000 program.25 The data were detwined using DETWIN in the ccp4 program suite with a twinnig fraction of 0.134. The initial model was obtained by molecular replacement using the CCP4 program Molrep.26,27 The structure of CML wild type (PDB: 2CWI) was used as a search model. The structural refinements were carried out using the program Refmac5 in the CCP4 package,28 and the structures were visually inspected using Coot.29 The final R-factor/R-free were 0.273/0.413 for the detwined data. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under code 2Z2E.
Sample solution preparation for measurements

of the nonenzymatic asparaginyl deamidation.30 In general, the deamidation rate increases with increasing pH, reflecting the deprotonation of the backbone nitrogen in the imide formation (see Fig. 1). Each fraction of the main and additional peaks was collected and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (data not shown). The molecular weights of these components corresponded to that of CML intact. Deamidation of an Asn residue makes only a 1-Da decrease in molecular weight, whereas this method cannot detect a 5-Da change. The presence of the three Asn-Gly and three Asn-Ser sequences in CML (see Fig. 3) was also suggestive of asparaginyl deamidation, because both of them are labile sequences to deamidation.15,31 The sum of the numbers of Asn-Gly and Asn-Ser were compared among C-type lysozymes and a-lactalbumins. A total of 124 sequences were derived from the Swiss-Prot database using PSIBLAST. CML had the greatest number (six) of Asn-Gly and Asn-Ser sequences; the other proteins had fewer than five (3 proteins had four, 12 proteins had three, 50 proteins had two, 49 proteins had one, and 9 proteins had zero Asn-(Gly or Ser) sequences). HEWL was also incubated at pH 8.0 and 308C, and there was no additional peak after incubation for 8 days [Fig. 2(d)]. Previously, deamidation in HEWL at higher temperatures was reported.19­21 HEWL does not appear to deamidate under the conditions used here. Asn residues in CML would more easily deamidate than those in HEWL.
Determination of the labile Asn residues

All sample solutions for the measurements were prepared by dissolving lyophilized protein in each buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by using the absorption coefficient, e 5 23.2%21 cm21, for CML wild type and mutants. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Detection of heterogeneous components in CML

Nonenzymatic asparaginyl deamidation is one of the most frequently reported modifications for introducing a negative charge to a protein. Therefore, we supposed that the charge heterogeneity observed in CML was caused by deamidation of Asn residues. To characterize the generation of CML heterogeneity, CML solution was incubated under different buffer conditions. The elution profile change during incubation was obtained by CE chromatography. As shown in Figure 2(a,b), additional peaks accumulated after incubation at 308C for 2­8 days at pH 8.0 and 6.0, respectively. The additional peaks were observed at lower elution conductivity than the main peak, suggesting that the components of these peaks have a greater negative charge than intact CML. As shown in Figure 2(c), incubation at pH 4.5 slightly generated additional peaks. This pH dependence is consistent with that

To confirm that the charge heterogeneity is caused by asparaginyl deamidation, we constructed several mutants in which some of the Asn residues were substituted to Gln residues. Glutaminyl deamidation in the same way as asparaginyl deamidation is much slower (more than two orders of magnitude) and would not be detected in the timescale here.32 The mutation sites were chosen on the basis of the primary sequence dependence, that is, AsnGly and Asn-Ser sites were selected primarily (see Fig. 3). As shown in Figure 2(e-i), the substitution of specific Asn residues substantially suppressed increases in the additional peaks compared with the wild type. This strongly supports the assumption that the heterogeneity is caused by asparaginyl deamidation. To determine the labile sites, we constructed some combinations of triple, quadruple, and quintuple mutants, and incubated them to test their reactions. We detected no additional peak after 44Q47Q49Q68Q (i.e. N44/47/49/68Q) was incubated [Fig. 2(e)]. The heterogeneity was generated apparently in the mutants in which one or more of these four Asn residues were not substituted [Fig. 2(f-i)]. Therefore, we concluded that Asn 44, 47, 49, and 68 are the deamidation sites in CML wild type under these conditions. It is noteworthy that two additional peaks are observed in the elution profiles of 44Q47N49Q68Q and

N47Q49Q68Q [Fig. 2(h,i)]. Because 44Q47Q49Q68Q exhibits no deamidation, these peaks are attributed to the deamidation of Asn 47 and 44, respectively. One probable explanation for this is that the deamidated CML including Asp 44 (or Asp 47) has a different elution conductivity than that including isoAsp 44 (or isoAsp 47).33 The deamidation rate of each Asn residue was measured using the triple mutants in which one Asn residue was deamidated. The half-life of each labile Asn residue is shown in Table I. Although the solution conditions are slightly different, the deamidation rates obtained here are almost the same order of magnitude as the mean values for short peptides reported before (t1/2 5 1.2 days for Gly-Xxx-Asn-Gly-Gly and t1/2 5 15.9 days for Gly-XxxAsn-Ser-Gly in 0.15M Tris-HCl buffer at 378C, pH 7.4).15 Deamidation in CML would be rather fast compared with that in many other proteins.36 Next, to check the effect of the three-dimensional structure formation on CML deamidation, CML mutants were incubated in 7M GuHCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) solution at 308C. CML adopts a fully unfolded conformation

with 7M GuHCl.7 Interestingly, an additional peak significantly increased with 44Q47Q49Q68Q [Fig. 2(j)], although this mutant did not deamidate without denaturant [Fig. 2(e)]. Therefore, CML has a residue that is deamidated only under the unfolding conditions. The most likely candidate was Asn 103, because it was followed by a Gly residue. Indeed, few additional peaks were observed with 44Q47Q49Q68Q103Q after incubation under the unfolding conditions [Fig. 2(k)]. This result clearly indicates that Asn 103 is deamidated under the denaturing conditions, although it is stable without denaturant.
Local structure formation and deamidation of each residue

Many previous reports have suggested that the primary sequence is not the only dominant factor of deamidation in proteins. Hydrogen bonds, especially of the backbone amide C-terminal to the Asn residue, would be a barrier to intermediate formation (see Fig. 1). Secondary structure formation also protects Asn residues against deamidation because the conformational flexibility is restrained.37,38

The value for each Asn residue was calculated from the experiment using a mutant: 44Q47Q49Q68N for Asn 68, 44Q47Q49N68Q for Asn 49, 44Q47N49Q68Q for Asn 47, and 44N47Q49Q68Q for Asn 44. b The t1/2 values are the estimates of the deamidation half-times for the asparagine residues in 0.15M Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4, 378C.34 The values were calculated with the information extracted from the crystal structures of CML wild-type (PDB 2CWI). The secondary structures and the hydrogen bonds were assigned using Swiss Pdb Viewer.35 c The values of the two crystal structures (PDB 2CWI) were averaged. The average value of the all amide nitrogens is 26.0.

and the number of hydrogen bonds around the Asn residue. We applied this method to the CML crystal structures (PDB code: 2CWI), and the results are shown in Table I (t1/2 calculated). This calculation correctly predicted the lability of the Asn residues except for Asn 103. Moreover, the deamidation rate of Asn 68 was predicted to be 10 times slower than that of Asn 49, although they were of the same order in our experiments. The rigidness would be difficult to estimate from a crystal structure. As a clue for predicting the deamidation rate more correctly, a parameter related to structural dynamics, such as the B-factor in X-ray crystallography, would be an indicator of Asn lability. A high B-factor reflects disorder of the individual site.39 The B-factor of the backbone amide nitrogen C-terminal to an Asn residue is shown in Table I. The Gly and Ser residues next to the labile Asn residues (Gly 45, Ser 48, Gly 50, and Ser 69) have large B-factor values, while the other residues (Ser

CML has three Asn-Gly and three Asn-Ser sequences in the b-strands and loop regions, but none in the a-helices [Fig. 4(a)]. In this study, we found that the labile residues are Asn 44 (- Gly 45), Asn 47 (- Ser 48), Asn 49 (- Gly 50), and Asn 68 (- Ser 69). Asn 47 and 49 are in a loop of the b-domain, and Asn 68 is in a larger loop of the b-domain. The structure formation around these residues does not inhibit deamidation sufficiently. However, a stable residue, Asn 103, is in a short loop connecting two a-helices, as shown in the X-ray structure [Fig. 4(a)]. Asn 103 would adopt a rigid structure such as that of b-turn [Fig. 4(b)]. Asn 44 and 60 are both located on the b-sheet, but only the former is labile. The X-ray structure shows that the backbone amide of Gly 45 does not contribute to the b-sheet formation and that of Ser 61 is hydrogen bonded, contributing to the b-sheet formation [Fig. 4(c)]. That might be a reason for the difference between the reactivities of Asn 44 and 60. In the case of CML, the factors that control the deamidation rates predominantly are supposed to be the primary structure, the secondary structure, and the hydrogen bond formation. Robinson and Robinson34 recently developed an algorithm to compute the deamidation rate of any protein as long as its three-dimensional structure has been determined. This calculation gives the predicted half-lives in days for the Asn residues in 0.15M Tris-HCl buffer at 378C, pH 7.4. The algorithm requires information on each Asn residue: the types of adjacent residues, distance in residues from an a-helix, b-sheet, or disulfide bridge,

Structure and activity of the mutant stabilized against deamidation

For use in the study of protein folding, the substitution of the four Asn residues (44, 47, 49, and 68) to glutamine will effectively prevent deamidation. Asn 103 also

should be substituted because protein folding studies are conducted under various conditions, including high pH and/or high denaturant concentrations. To confirm that the substitutions did not disrupt the native and MG structures, the CD spectra of wild-type CML and the mutant 5NQ (44Q47Q49Q68Q103Q) were measured under the conditions where the wild type adopted the native (pH 4.5) and MG (pH 2.0) states.

lines), there are clear peaks at 294 and 288 nm, indicating the tertiary structure formation.7 In the MG state (dotted lines), the decrements of these peaks are observed. The signal intensity around 225 nm is larger for the MG state than for the native state, indicating the presence of the substantial secondary structure. The CD spectra of 5NQ [Fig. 5(b)] are quite similar to those of the wild type. These results indicate that 5NQ retains an ability to form the native and MG states as well as the wild type. To further confirm the structural properties of 5NQ mutant, the three-dimensional structure of 5NQ was obtained using X-ray crystallography [Fig. 6(a)]. Figure 6(b) shows the backbone structures of CML wild type and 5NQ. The root-mean-square deviation for the back° bone atoms between the two proteins was 0.511 A. The superposition shows some differences in the regions including Asn 47, 49, and 68. However, the electron density in these regions of both proteins is not observed, and we cannot discuss the differences in detail. The substitutions of Asn 44 and 103 did not alter the backbone conformations and side-chain directions. We concluded that the crystal structure of 5NQ is substantially identical to that of the wild type, and that the substitutions of Asn to Gln would be appropriate for the folding and structural analyses of this protein. Although the structural formation of 5NQ was not impaired, its lytic activity was much lower than that of the wild type, by a factor of 20 (data not shown). The

structure of HEWL and oligosaccharide complex suggests that Asn 44, 47, 49, and 103 of CML are at or near the substrate binding site.40 Introducing larger residues near the active site could be a steric hindrance from substrate binding. Substitution to an Asp residue would not change the residue size but would introduce a negative charge. It could lower the lytic activity, because a net positive charge is important for access to negatively charged membranes of bacteria.41 The substitution of Asn-Gly to Asn-Ala can be effective, if the conformational stability does not decrease significantly.19 CML adopts an extraordinarily stable MG state compared with other C-type lysozymes and a-lactalbumins, as mentioned above.1,7 This study revealed another intriguing property of CML: it rapidly deamidates at multiple sites under mild conditions. The physiological role of deamidation in CML is indeed unknown, but deamidation in CML could proceed in native dog milk because Asn residues in CML are deamidated at neutral pH and mild temperature.

CONCLUSIONS Recently, a kinetic intermediate homologous to the MG state in the folding of CML has been analyzed in detail.5,6 However, the role of the folding intermediate in the folding pathway is still under debate. The mechanism by which the MG state of CML is more stabilized

than that of a-lactalbumin is also not clear.42 Detailed characterization of the MG states of these proteins would provide insights into MG formation and the protein folding of globular proteins. CML can easily undergo deamidation under mild conditions. The labile residues were determined to be Asn 44, 47, 49, and 68. Furthermore, Asn 103 is labile to deamidation only under the denaturing conditions. The lability of CML presented here indicates that the degradation of CML wild type can easily occur during some experiments. Therefore, the quintuple mutant stabilized against deamidation, 5NQ was constructed. We verified that 5NQ mutant retains an ability to form the native and MG states. Stabilization of CML against deamidation will improve the yield of pure recombinant protein and the reproducibility of experiments. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank former Professor K.
