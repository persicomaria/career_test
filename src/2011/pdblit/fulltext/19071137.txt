a b s t r a c t
The role of each subcomponent of Clostridium botulinum serotype B haemagglutinin (HA), which is one component of 16S toxin, and consists of four subcomponents (HA1, 2, 3a, and 3b), was investigated. In order to identify the subcomponent contributing to the stability of a neurotoxin in the gastro-intestinal tract, each recombinant HA (rHA) subcomponent was incubated with gastro-intestinal proteases. Although rHA1 and rHA3 were stable to these proteases except for specific cleavage, rHA2 was not. Antifree whole HA serum reacted with neither rHA2 nor HA2 in 16S toxin on both Western blot and ELISA, while anti-rHA2 serum reacted with both rHA2 and HA2 in 16S toxin on Western blots, although it did not react with 16S toxin in ELISA. Binding or haemagglutination activity against erythrocytes was found in rHA1 and rHA3, but not in rHA2. In addition, only HA1 bound to the intestinal section. These results indicate that the HA (and 16S toxin) complex is assembled in the way that HA1 and HA3 (HA3a plus HA3b) encase HA2, followed by modification with trypsin-like bacterial protease, leading to the conclusion that HA1 and HA3 act as protective factors for the neurotoxin and as attachment factors to host cells.

1. Introduction Clostridium botulinum strains produce immunologically distinct (types A to G) neurotoxins (NTX). The molecular mass (Mr) of NTX is approximately 150 kDa. In culture fluid and food with acidic conditions, NTXs associate with non-toxic components, and form large complexes designated progenitor toxins (PTXs). The PTXs are found in three forms with Mr of 900 kDa (19S or LL toxin), 500 kDa (16S or L toxin), and 300 kDa (12S or M toxin) [1]. 12S toxin is composed of a NTX and a non-toxic component with no haemagglutinin activity (designated as non-toxic non-HA; NTNH), whereas 16S and 19S toxins are composed of NTX, NTNH, and haemagglutinin (HA). Type A strain produces all three forms of toxins (19S, 16S, and 12S). Type B, C, and D strains produce 16S and 12S toxins, and type E, F, and G strains produce only 12S or 16S toxins, respectively. Recently, we found that 19S toxin is a dimer of 16S toxin, and that type A and type B strains produce HA complexes that exist freely in cultures

without assembling with the toxin molecules (free whole HA) [2,3]. Oral toxicities of PTX in correlation with Mr of PTX, leading to the HA has been thought to be a protective factor of NTX from gastrointestinal juice [4]. Furthermore, it has been thought that HA was an attachment factor of HA-positive (HAþ) toxin to the small intestine prior to absorption, since 16S toxin, but not 12S and NTX, bound to epithelial cell of the small intestine in a guinea pig [5]. HA consists of four subcomponents designated as HA1, HA2, HA3a, and HA3b [1]. HA1 has a Mr of 33­35 kDa, and some HA1 molecules exist as a free form in culture fluids of type A to D strains, as well as free whole HA [2,3,6,7]. The Mrs of HA3a and HA3b are 19­23 kDa and 51­53 kDa, respectively, and they are formed by the cleavage of HA3 (approximately 70 kDa) [2,3,8,9]. This cleavage is caused by trypsin treatment in type D-L toxin, which had intact HA3 [10]. By employing recombinant HA1 and HA3b, it became clear that HA1 and HA3 play an important role in binding of HAþ PTXs to the epithelial cells of the small intestine in type A and C strains [11,12]. On the other hand, the function of HA2 (15­18 kDa) is still unknown, since there has been no success in dissociating HA complex into HA1, HA2 and HA3 under a non-denaturing condition. Although Kouguchi et al. succeeded in dissociating and purifying the HA33/17 (HA1/HA2) complex and HA70 (HA3) from 16S toxin under the denaturing condition with guanidine hydrochloride, the

former protein complex did not dissociate any longer [10]. In addition, the biological function of type B HA is also unclear because the sequence of the HA3 gene has not been entirety determined. In this study, we firstly determined the whole nucleotide sequences of type B PTX gene including HA3, and then investigated the biological function of each HA subcomponent by preparing them as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Complete nucleotide sequences of PTX The complete nucleotide sequences of the type B strain Okra PTX and regulatory protein p21 (botR) were determined by IPCR methods. As reported in other serotypes [1], the type B PTX components were encoded by two gene clusters transcribed in the opposite direction to each other; one contains botR, ntnh, and ntx, and the other contains ha1, ha2, and ha3 (Fig. 1a). The length of the genes, the numbers of encoded amino acids, and calculated molecular masses are shown in Table 1. The ha1, ha2, and ntnh sequences have already been determined [13,14]. However, the sequence of ha1 and ntnh of our stock analysed this time were somewhat different from the previous reports. In our strain stock, the length of ha1 was 885 bp encoding 294 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 33.7 kDa, and three differences were observed (Leu87 to Gln, Tyr258 to Asp, and insertion of an additional Asn between Gln232 and Asn233) compared with the previous data [14]. The ha3, newly determined completely this time, was 1881 bp encoding 626 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 71.2 kDa. The length of ntnh was 3594 bp encoding 1197 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 138.8 kDa, and only one amino acid was different (Tyr548 to Asp) from previous data [13]. The signal sequence of each protein predicted by computer software (Genetyx Ver.5.1) did not correspond to the N-terminal amino acid sequence described previously [3]. The comparative amino acid sequence of PTX between type B Okra strain and other C. botulinum strains is shown in Table 2. The

identities of the amino acid sequence of type B HA subcomponents among serotypes were 33.3­84.4% (HA1), 63.0­97.9% (HA2), and 68.2­98.2% (HA3), and the levels of sequence identity with type A strain were the highest of all the serotypes already determined. 2.2. SDS­PAGE profiles of rHA subcomponents From the nucleotide sequences determined in this study, PCR fragments encoding each HA subcomponent gene were inserted into pGEX-6P-3, and then expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 (Fig. 1b). SDS­PAGE profiles of each recombinant protein, from which the GST-tag was eliminated by PreScission protease digestion, are shown in Fig. 1c. rHA1 (lane 1), rHA2 (lane 2), rHA3 (lane 3), and rHA3b (lane 4) were somewhat larger than the molecular sizes of native HA subcomponents of botulinum 16S toxin (lane 5), because they were designed as precursor forms and retained 6 or 9 GST amino acid residues at the N-terminal end (Fig. 1b). 2.3. Stability of each HA subcomponent against intestinal proteases In an attempt to clarify their stability against intestinal proteases, each rHA subcomponent was treated with TPCK-trypsin and chymotrypsin at 37  C.

rHA1 was digested slightly and gradually yielded a 34 kDa fragment, which was almost the same molecular mass as the native HA1 in 16S toxin by TPCK-trypsin treatment. This fragment became detectable 2 h after the start of the reaction, but intact rHA1 was still present up to 8 h even though it was treated at a protein (P) to enzyme (E) ratio (P:E) of 2:1 (Fig. 2a). However, all of the intact rHA1 was shifted to a single 34 kDa fragment after 1 h when it was mixed with chymotrypsin at a P:E ratio of 10:1 (Fig. 2b). Ser5 of HA1 was identified as the N-terminal amino acid residue in the 34 kDa bands that appeared following TPCK-trypsin treatment, indicating that the cleavage by TPCK-trypsin was caused by the chymotrypsin which was contaminating in this preparation. rHA3 (70 kDa) was cleaved into 23 (HA3a) and 51 kDa (HA3b) bands by TPCK trypsin treatment at a P:E ratio of 2:1 (Fig. 2d). The first N-terminal residues of HA3a and HA3b were Val16 and Val203, respectively, and both of these were followed lysine residues. These were the same as those of HA3a and HA3b obtained from the native 16S toxin [3]. On the other hand, when rHA3 was treated with chymotrypsin at a P:E ratio of 10:1, three bands with Mr of 51, 23, and 19 kDa, which were the same mobility of the bands of HA3b, HA3a and more extensively cleaved HA3a of 16S toxin, respectively, were observed after 8 h of treatment (Fig. 2e, left lane). It has been shown that the 19 kDa band, which was also observed in the 16S toxin preparation in Fig. 1c, was cleaved at the carboxy-terminal of tyrosine [3], suggesting that this band might be produced by chymotrypsin-like protease. From the mobility on SDS­PAGE, it was suggested that the other two bands were produced by trypsin which was contaminating in the chymotrypsin preparation. On the other hand, rHA2 was partially degraded with a P:E ratio of 100:1 (data not shown) and completely degraded into small peptides at 10:1 after 4 h (Fig. 2c). When 16S toxin was treated with these proteases, banding profiles did not show any changes, with the exception of NTX which was nicked into heavy and light chains by trypsin (Fig. 2f). These findings indicated that HA1 and HA3 were very stable to these proteases. 2.4. Stability of each HA subcomponent against in the gastric condition In an attempt to clarify their stability in the gastric condition, each subcomponent was treated with pepsin under acidic conditions. rHA1 slightly changed its electrical mobility compared with intact rHA1 when it was exposed to pepsin at a P:E ratio of 2:1 (Fig. 3a). In the case of rHA3, it had cleaved into three fragments after 1 h of reaction; one was the same mobility of the bands of

HA3b, the others were not identical to those of HA3a (Fig. 3b). This cleavage pattern was not found when 16S toxin was treated with pepsin (Fig. 3c) suggesting that this was an intrinsic reaction of the free (i.e. recombinant) HA3. However, additional changes were not found in both of preparations during incubation period. On the other hand, rHA2 was degraded completely in the same condition (data not shown). These findings suggested that (1) HA1 alone was most stable factor to gastro-intestinal proteases, (2) HA3 alone was also stable to these proteases except for the position of nicking by pepsin, which was different from that of 16S toxin, (3) the specific cleavage of HA3 into HA3a and HA3b was caused by trypsin-like proteases, and (4) HA2 alone was very susceptible to these proteases. 2.5. Antigenicity of each subcomponent in the 16S toxin When the free whole HA or the 16S toxin was treated with gastro-intestinal proteases, HA2 did not cleave at all, as shown in Figs. 2f and 3c. We speculated that HA2 may not be degraded by proteases because it exists inside of the free whole HA and 16S toxin molecules. This hypothesis was supported by both ELISA and Western blot analysis using two antisera against free whole HA and rHA2 as follows. On ELISA with anti-HA antiserum, reaction titres of both rHA1 and rHA3 were high (Â156,250) as also seen with 16S toxin, but the titre of rHA2 was low (Â250) (Table 3). On the Western blot with these sera and 16S toxin, the reaction with HA1 and HA3b was strong, and to a lesser extent with HA3a, but formed no obvious band with HA2 (Fig. 4). On the ELISA with anti-rHA2 serum, the reaction with rHA2 was high (Â31,250), but that with 16S toxin (actually, it is a reaction to HA2 in the 16S toxin) was low (<10) (Table 3). However, on the Western blot with 2000-fold diluted anti-HA2 antiserum, the reaction to HA2 in the 16S toxin was strong (Fig. 4). Based on these results, it was concluded that HA2 in the 16S toxin or free whole HA molecule is encased within HA1 and/or HA3, and this is the reason why the HA2 in these molecules is not degraded by proteases treatment, and that why little anti-HA2 antibody was produced when the 16S toxin or free whole HA preparations were used to immunize rabbits. Based on the result that the cleavage of HA3 at the different position from that of 16S toxin was caused by pepsin (Fig. 3), a part of HA3 might be also hidden by other subcomponent(s) in these complexes to protect this region. This hypothesis is supported by the result that the antigenicity of HA3b was stronger than that of HA3a in Western blot analysis using anti-HA serum. 2.6. Binding of rHAs to erythrocytes (RBCs) Since type B 16S toxin bound to both native and neuraminidasetreated RBC (Fig. 5), a microtitre assay was employed to determine the binding ability of each subcomponent to RBCs. Trypsin-treated or untreated rHA1 and rHA3 bound to native RBCs as effectively as 16S toxin, but binding was relatively weak for rHA3b. rHA1 also bound to neuraminidase-treated and untreated RBCs as effectively as 16S toxin, whereas rHA3 and rHA3b did not bind to the neuraminidase-treated RBCs. Since the binding profiles of rHA3b corresponded to rHA3, it was speculated that rHA3 bound to RBCs via the HA3b region. rHA2 showed no obvious positive binding in any assay. 2.7. Haemagglutination

Type B 16S toxin showed haemagglutination (HA) activity, and this was strongly enhanced by employing neuraminidase-treated RBCs (Table 4), which was different profiles from type A HAþ-toxin [15]. To investigate which subcomponents are involved in this HA activity, a HA test was performed using each recombinant HA

Fig. 2. Reactivity of each rHA subcomponent to TPCK-trypsin or chymotrypsin. 2 mg each of rHA1 (a and b), rHA2 (c), rHA3 (d and e) was mixed with TPCK-trypsin or chymotrypsin at protein to enzyme ratios of 10:1 or 2:1. The mixtures were incubated for indicated times at 37  C, and thereafter SDS­PAGE was performed. (f) 4 mg of 16S toxin was incubated with TPCK-trypsin (þTrp) or chymotrypsin (þChy) at a protein to enzyme ratio of 2:1 for 8 h.

subcomponent and RBCs with or without neuraminidase treatment. In the cases of rHA1 and rHA3, trypsin-treated preparations were used in addition to intact ones. rHA2 and rHA3b showed HA activity with neither native- nor neuraminidase-treated RBCs, whereas rHA3 showed a high HA titre with native RBCs similar to 16S toxin. However, the activity of rHA3 was diminished when neuraminidase-treated RBCs or trypsin-treated rHA3 was used. In case of rHA1, high HA activity was observed only when neuraminidase-treated RBCs were used. Furthermore, the HA activity of rHA1 was completely inhibited by the addition of 25 mM lactose or 50 mM galactose, but not by the addition of more than 100 mM glucose (data not shown). These binding properties of rHA1 corresponded to the previous report that type B 16S toxin bound to lactose via HA1 [3], and indicating that rHA1 also binds to galactose moieties. From these findings, it was suggested that the sugar chains with galactose at their terminus may be covered or hidden by the sialic acid at their terminus, and it was exposed by neuraminidase treatment, leading to the positive haemagglutination reaction by rHA1.

The HA activity of rHA3 was remarkably diminished by trypsin treatment that converts the intact rHA3 to a nicked form, indicating that nicked HA3 shows little HA activity. However, the 16S toxin, consisting of HA3 with nicked form, HA1 and HA2, showed high HA activity against native RBCs, which rHA1 and rHA2 did not agglutinate (Table 4), indicating that the haemagglutination of native RBC by type B 16S toxin might be caused by two recognitions; the galactose moiety by HA1 and the sialic acid by HA3b. Binding site of HA3b to neuraminidase-treated RBC completely disappears, while that of HA1 is increased as described above. The increase of the HA titre of the native 16S toxin with neuraminidase-treated RBCs also may be explained by this hypothesis. However, it has not been confirmed whether the intrinsic properties of each subcomponent is retained or not after forming HA complex, because we have not succeeded in constructing of the whole HA complex by using three (HA1, 2, and 3) recombinant HA subunit preparations. In spite of the fact that the binding profiles of type A and C HA1 and HA3 to the native and

Fig. 4. Western blot analysis with rabbit sera against free whole HA (Anti-HA) or rHA2 (Anti-HA2). PVDF membrane electroblotted 16S toxin was reacted with each antiserum diluted 2000-fold with 10% skimmed milk­PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Specific bands were detected with ECL detection reagent. The membrane was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (CBB).

neuraminidase-treated RBCs are almost as same as those of type B obtained in this study, which HA1 recognized galactose moiety and HA3 recognized sialic acid, those of each HAþ PTXs complex to the neuraminidase-treated RBCs were quite different between each serotype [11,12]. The differences in binding and haemagglutination activity of HAþ-PTX to the RBCs among serotypes might be concerned with the difference of the arrangement of HA1 and HA3 in the HAþ PTX.

3. Conclusions We propose the following hypothesis. HA1, HA2, and HA3 might be first assembled to form the 16S toxin precursor in the way that HA1 and HA3 encase HA2. HA2 might act as a linkage between HA1 and HA3 as Mutoh et al. suggested [16], in addition to protecting itself from proteases, a part of HA3 might be also hidden by other subcomponent(s) and then, HA3 is nicked by bacterial trypsin-like protease, which does not affect HA1. The mature HA or 16S toxin formed through these processes may play roles as a protective factor of NTX in the gastro-intestinal tract by HA1 and HA3. Furthermore, these complexes bind to RBCs via HA1 and HA3 (HA3b region) and to small intestine at least via HA1. The molecular profile of each subcomponent in PTX shows more functional effects as the protective factor or the ligand to receptors. To confirm these hypotheses, intermediate or complete HA complex must be synthesized using in vitro or in vivo techniques.

2.8. Binding of rHAs to small intestinal tissue 16S toxin bound to upper small intestine (Fig. 6a), while 12S toxin did not (data not shown) as described in other serotypes [5,11,12]. Although this binding was also found when rHA1 was used instead of 16S toxin, it was not found when rHA3 was used (Fig. 6b and c), suggesting that at least HA1 was associated with intestinal binding of 16S toxin. It has been reported that rHA3 bound to the upper small intestine, recognizing sialic acids similar to as it was in RBCs in type A and C strains [11,12]. However, HA3 alone does not appear to play an important role in intestinal binding in type B strain. The binding property of the type B HA3 differed between RBCs and intestinal mucosa, in spite of the fact that there were abundant levels of sialic acids in the small intestine, suggesting an existence of the co-receptors except for sialic acids. The binding of rHA1 alone to the intestinal section was weaker than that of 16S toxin in comparison to the amount of protein used to obtain the same results, leading to the assumption that the binding of 16S toxin through HA complex needs multiple interactions.

4.2. Preparation of toxin and recombinant proteins PTXs and free whole HA of C. botulinum type B strain Okra were purified according to the procedure described previously [2,3]. An expression plasmid of each HA subcomponent was constructed according to the procedure described previously [19]. Briefly, the primer sets encoding whole HA1, HA2, HA3, and HA3b were designed (each of the sequences is available as Supplementary Table S2 in Elsevier Online) and PCR were performed. The PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and ligated into GST expression vector pGEX-6P-3 (Amersham Biosciences) treated with same enzymes. Each constructed plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21CodonPlus RIL competent cells (Stratagene), and recombinant proteins were expressed and purified, according to the procedure described previously [19].

4. Materials and methods 4.3. Preparation of antisera 4.1. Cloning of the PTX gene Total genomic DNA as a template was prepared from C. botulinum type B strain Okra. In an attempt to determine the nucleotide sequence of the NTX gene (ntx) and its downstream region, oligonucleotide primer set (B7S-4f and B7S30 -1r) were designed according to the sequence of the Eklund 17B strain [17]. To determine the nucleotide sequence of the HA3 gene (ha3) and its downstream region, genomic DNA was digested with XbaI and selfligated products were used as the template of inverse PCR (IPCR). IPCR was performed with the primer set (IPCR-1f and HA-5r) designed according to the partially determined sequence of the upstream region of ha3 [18]. DNA sequencing of the PCR products was performed by ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), and the obtained data were analysed by SEQUENCHERÔ Version 4.5 (GENE codes). The sequence of all the primers used are available as Supplementary Table S1 in Elsevier Online, and the nucleotide sequence data determined in this article has been submitted to the DDBJ database under accession number AB232927. Each recombinant protein was immunized into a rabbit (New Zealand White, 13 weeks, female). Initially, 500 mg of protein was first emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously. Three weeks later, a second immunization was performed subcutaneously with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. After three more weeks, a final booster injection was performed intravenously without adjuvant. After two more weeks, a whole blood sample was collected from the carotid artery under anaesthesia with pentobarbital sodium and antiserum was collected by centrifugation at 3000 Â g for 20 min. This experiment was conducted under the Guidelines of Animal Experimentation of Okayama University.

4.4. Enzyme treatment of protein samples and erythrocytes The 16S toxin and HA subcomponents were mixed with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated bovine pancreatic

trypsin (TPCK-trypsin) (Worthington Biochemical) in PBS (pH 6.0) or bovine pancreatic a-chymotrypsin (Wako Pure Chemical) in PBS (pH 6.0), porcine stomach pepsin (Wako Pure Chemical) in 10 mM HCl containing 0.15 M NaCl, at appropriate concentrations, and the mixtures were incubated for appropriate times at 37  C. Neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes (type O) were prepared by the procedures described previously [7]. 4.5. Binding to erythrocytes The binding of HA subcomponents and 16S toxin to erythrocytes were analysed by the procedure described previously [7]. Aliquots, 100 ml, of 50 mg mlÀ1 rHAs or 16S toxin were plated into 96-well microtitre plates and left to stand overnight at 4  C. The wells were washed three times with 200 ml of PBS (pH 6.0), then 150 ml PBS containing 1% BSA (BSA-PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times, 100 ml of 1% (v/v) non-treated (native) or neuraminidase-treated human erythrocytes in BSA­PBS were added to each well for 30 min at room temperature. After washing six times, bound erythrocytes were then lysed by adding 100 ml of distilled water and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured. 4.6. Haemagglutination test Haemagglutination titre was obtained by a microtitration method using round-bottomed 96-well plates [7,15]. Aliquots, 40 ml, of each HA subcomponent or 16S toxin, diluted in serial twofold steps with PBS (pH 6.0), were mixed with an equal volume of 1% (v/v) native or neuraminidase-treated human erythrocytes. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h, the minimum concentrations that caused haemagglutination were determined. Inhibition of haemagglutination activity of rHA1 with several different saccharides (lactose, D-galactose, and glucose) was examined as follows. rHA1 was diluted to 200 mg mlÀ1 with saccharide solutions, which were diluted in serial two-fold steps from 100 mM to 1.5625 mM with PBS (pH 6.0). The mixture (40 ml) in each well was incubated for 1 h at 37  C; the haemagglutination test against neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes was employed as described above, and the lowest concentration of the saccharide that showed complete inhibition of haemagglutination was determined. 4.7. ELISA

4.8. Western blot analysis 16S toxin or rHA2 were separated by SDS­PAGE using 12.5% (w/v) gel. The separated bands were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) with a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Nippon Eido), and then the membrane was incubated with S-PBS for 2 h at room temperature. After washing the membrane with T-PBS three times for 5 min each time, the membrane was incubated with 2000-fold diluted anti-free whole HA (anti-HA) or rHA2 (anti-HA2) rabbit serum for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the membrane was reacted with HRP-labelled anti-rabbit Ig porcine Ig diluted 10,000-fold for 1 h at room temperature and then specific bands were detected using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The PVDF membrane was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. 4.9. Binding to small intestinal tissue Samples of the upper small intestine were removed from the anaesthetized guinea pigs (Hartley, 8 weeks, female). The sections were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound 4583 (Sakura Finetechnical Co. Ltd.) and frozen 5 mm slices were cut using Tissue-Tek Cryo3 (Sakura). To detect the binding of 16S toxin, rHA1 and rHA3 to the intestinal slices, immunostaining was carried out according to the procedure described previously with slight modification [5]. The slices were rinsed in PBS (pH 6.0) and then incubated with 1 M glycine in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (washing buffer), they were incubated with 16S toxin, rHA1 and rHA3 in a humidity chamber for 1 h at room temperature. To diminish the reaction by endogenous peroxidase derived from tissues, following treatments were employed. After washing with ice-cold PBS three times for 5 min each time, the slices were soaked in 5 mM periodic acid solution for 10 min at room temperature. After washing three times with icecold PBS, the slices were soaked in 3 mM sodium tetrahydroborate solution for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with icecold PBS three times for 5 min each time, the slices were incubated with 10% (v/v) normal porcine serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and followed by reaction with 250-fold diluted anti-free whole HA rabbit serum overnight in the humidity chamber at 4  C. After washing with the washing buffer twice for 10 min each time, the slices were reacted with 100-fold diluted HRP-conjugated antirabbit Ig porcine Ig for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with washing buffer six times for 5 min each time, the specific binding of each protein was detected with diaminobenzidine liquid (Dako). 4.10. Determination of amino acid sequence

One microgram of 16S toxin or each HA subcomponent in 100 ml of PBS (pH 7.4) was plated into 96-well immunoplates and incubated at 4  C overnight. After washing three times with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 (T-PBS), each well was blocked with 200 ml of PBS containing 10% (w/v) skimmed milk (S-PBS) for 2 h at 37  C. After washing again, 100 ml of rabbit antiserum or normal serum diluted in serial five-fold steps with S-PBS was added and incubated for 1 h at 37  C. After washing, 100 ml of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled anti-rabbit Ig porcine Ig (Dako) diluted 1000-fold with S-PBS was allowed to react for 1 h at 37  C. Then the plate was washed with T-PBS followed by the addition of 100 ml of citrate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.04% (w/v) of ophenylenediamine and 0.02% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide and was incubated for 30 min at 37  C. This reaction was stopped with 100 ml of 1 M H2SO4 and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm in a microplate reader (TECAN). Each antibody titre was determined as a reciprocal of the highest dilution indicating the subtraction of the absorbance of normal serum from that of antiserum was higher than 0.5.

The amino (N)-terminal amino acid sequence of each protein was determined. The bands, separated by SDS­PAGE with the 12.5% polyacrylamide gel were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes as described above. The bands were stained, cut out, and then sequenced with a pulsed-liquid phase protein sequencer (Model 477-A; Applied Biosystems).
