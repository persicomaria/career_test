Abstract
The crystal structure of/3-purothionin ((3-PT) has been determined at 1.7A resolution. (;/-PT and previously solved c~l-PT belong to a family of membrane-active plant toxins homologous to crambin. (4-PT crystallizes in the same space group as ~zl-PT (1422) but with the c axis 3/~ longer than (~I-PT. The unit-cell dimensions of ¢4-PT crystals are a = b = 53.94 and c = 72.75 ,A,. Two data sets were collected on a multiwire area detector, each with Rsym around 6.0%, and were merged to get a single data set at 1.7 A, (Rmerge = 9.6%). The X-ray structure of ~I-PT was used to build a starting model for ~-PT. The /3-PT model was refined using the program PROLSQ from 10 to 1.7 A resolution to an R factor of 19.8% with very good geometry. The final structure contains 439 atoms including 337 protein atoms, 77 waters, two acetates, two glycerols and one phosphate. The highresolution structure of the ~4-PT agreed well with that of the lower resolution c~-PT structure only after the latter was extensively rerefined. Both refinements revealed phosphate and glycerol molecules which are important in lattice formation. The binding of phosphate and glycerol molecules to purothionins (PT) was confirmed by NMR and was implicated in the biological activity of toxins. Modeling of phospholipid binding to PT based on glycerol and phosphate-binding site could shed light on the lytic toxicity of this protein-toxin family. Although the structures of (~I-PT and /3-PT preserve the overall fold of crambin, they exhibit key differences that are directly relevant to the toxicity of thionins.

ordered crystals. After several modifications to initial crystallization conditions, crystals diffracting to 1.7/~ were obtained. /3-PT has about 88% sequence identity with o~t-PT. It differs from ~l-PT only at five residues out of 45 residues. The important changes are at positions 27 and 42 where glycine residues are replaced by asparagine and aspartic acid, respectively (Fig. 1). These changes should not induce major changes in the backbone structure. The structure of [~-PT should, therefore, be very similar to that of c~l-PT. With this knowledge, a crystallographic study of/3-pT was undertaken in order to (i) ascertain the structural similarities between the two purothionins and (ii) determine the structure at higher resolution so as to understand the toxic behavior in greater detail. We used homology modeling to build a model of/3-PT by replacing those residues of the o~l-PT model which are different in [~-PT. The resulting model has been used to solve the X-ray structure. This paper describes the crystallization of ~3-PT, its crystal structure determination at 1.7 A, resolution and its comparison to the ~ - P T structure. The sequence differences between crambin and these thionins contribute directly to the membrane activity of the toxins.

2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Crystallization of (}-PT 2.1.1. Crystallization conditions. Plate-like crystals of
/3-PT were grown by sitting-drop vapor-diffusion methods similar to those used for growing crystals of c~-PT (Teeter et al., 1990). As precipitant we used either 2methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) or sec-butanol. A typical crystallization with sec-butanol consisted of a 20ml dip with 50 mg ml -l L4-PT in sodium cacodylate (CAC) buffer at pH 5.9 to which 8 to 15%(v/v) sec-butanol was added. The dip was equilibrated against 12% secbutanol and 17% MgCI2 in 90 mM CAC buffer (pH = 5.9) at room temperature. Plate-like crystals were readily obtained in a week. In the case of MPD as precipitant, crystals were obtained when dips containing 10 or 15% MPD were equilibrated against 10% MPD and 22% MgC12 in the reservoir. Slightly thicker crystals were obtained when the dips contained a trace amount (1.0%) of dioxane. Most of the crystals had dimensions of 0.2 x 0.2

1. Introduction
Thionins constitute an important family of plant toxins (Bohlman & Apel, 1991) which are ,-,60% homologous to crambin. The crystal structure of a member of this family, ~-purothionin (al-PT), has recently been determined in our laboratory at 2.5 A resolution (Teeter, Ma, Rao & Whitlow, 1990; Rao, Stec & Teeter, 1995). Because of inherent problems with the c~-PT crystals, however, higher resolution data could not be collected from these crystals. In order to better understand the toxic behavior of these thionins (Carrasco et al., 1981), we crystallized/~-purothionin (L4-PT) and obtained well

They were more fragile than crystals obtained from CAC. The presence of MgCI2 in the reservoir seemed critical in all these set ups. Since sec-butanoi had a phase separation at 20% concentration, higher concentrations could not be used. Hence, MgCI2 was necessary to drive water out of the dip. The crystals obtained by these methods, however, had an intrinsic tendency for twinning: they looked like thin plates stacked one over the other with a slight rotation between layers. 2.1.2. Stabilization of the crystals. Initial attempts were made to collect X-ray diffraction data from the plate-like crystals grown from CAC buffer but several problems were encountered. Crystals were very tiny and dissolved quickly when the crystallization boxes were opened. Since they were grown from alcohol at a very critical equilibrium concentration, they redissolved in the mother liquor even at minimal evaporation of the alcohol. Additional problems were posed by the small amount of mother liquor around the crystals. Various methods of crystal mounting such as oil mounting, glovebox mounting, etc. were tried to circumvent these problems in vain. Hence we developed a stabilization procedure for the crystals. Various concentrations of MPD and ( N H 4 ) 2 S O 4 ( A S ) were tried both individually and in combination. 100% of ammonium sulfate (AS) alone caused the crystals to dissolve and reappear as precipitate whereas MPD alone resulted in the development of cracks in the crystals. Finally a mixture of 30% saturated AS and 8% MPD seemed to stabilize the crystals well. 2.1.3. Improvement of the crystal quality. Because of the role of AS in stabilizing the crystals, attempts were made to crystallize in the presence of AS as well. Large crystals were grown from 20ml dip containing 1 5 m g m l -l /~-PT, 2% dioxane, 5% MPD and 58% AS in 75 mM CAC buffer (pH = 5.9) equilibrated against 10% MPD and 20% MgC12 in 90 mM CAC buffer. The presence of AS prevented drying of the dips by lowering the solubility of the protein. A thick large crystal was therefore cut to a size of 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.2 mm, stabilized with the previously described solution, and mounted in a glass capillary. The crystal diffracted well (up to 2.1 A). The /3-PT crystals belong to the same space group (1422) as a1-PT with similar cell parameters: a = b = 53.94, c = 72.75/1, and

~r = g = 3' = 90 °. The c dimension of fl-PT was larger than for ~-VF by ~ 3 A. Eventually, even better crystals of ,,~0.5 x 0.3 x 0 . 2 m m size were grown in about 10d when a mixture of MPD, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and AS was used as precipitant. Here a 2 0 m l dip containing 50 mg m1-1 of /9-PT in 90 mM CAC with 10% MPD, 2.5% PEG4000 and 8% AS was equilibrated against a reservoir containing 10% MPD and 20% MgC12 in 7 5 m M CAC (pH = 5.9). This batch of crystals diffracted to 1.7,~, resolution. 2.2. Data collection and analysis Two different data sets were collected using a Xuong-Hamlin multiwire area detector powered by a Rigaku RU200 rotating-anode generator at 50kV and 100 mA equipped with a graphite monochromator. A monochromatized Cu Ko~ X-ray beam was used. The crystal to detector distance was 400 mm, which along with the detector 20 value (19 °) allowed the data collection to 2.1 A resolution. Intensity and 0. of each observation along with all indexing and background corrections were calculated simultaneously with the scanning process. In this manner, 11 407 observations of 2646 independent reflections were collected for/4-PT. The data was reduced by software provided by San Diego Multiwire Systems, the intensities were next reduced by applying the usual Lorentz and polarization corrections, scaled together in 55 increments of a;, and averaged. Final Rsym (Rsym ~il<I>-lil/)2<I)) for the data was 5.63%. This data set was 99% complete to 2.31,4, and contains 66% data to 2.25 A. The overall fraction of data measured above 20 is 97%. A second native data set has been collected on a fresh crystal grown in the presence of mineral oil. Mineral oil, which was a remnant from our previous oil mounting attempts, was present in the droplets and the crystals formed readily on the interface between oil and mother liquor. The better crystal quality and the use of crystalto-chamber distance of 400 mm with the 20 value of the detector being -32 ° allowed the data to be collected up to 1.7/~ resolution. A total of 44 767 reflections comprising of 4595 unique reflections were measured and reduced as described above with Rsym being 6.1%. However, due to interruption in the data-collection procedure, we collected only 80% of the data. Therefore, we merged the

two data sets. They were scaled in different resolution ranges and the data from the second set in the 2.3-1.7/~, resolution range were merged with the 2.3/~ data of the first set. The merged data set contained 5092 reflections with an Rmerg e of 9.6%. 2.3. Modeling and refinement of the/4PT structure The model for/'3-PT was constructed from partially rerefined o~I-PT model at 18.4% R value (reduced from 21.6%, Teeter et al., 1990) by changing the appropriate residues in FRODO. All these changed residues were subjected to about 30 cycles of Hermans' geometric refinement (1974) using the FRODO package. Because of the small number of changes, global energy minimization was not used. However, side chains were placed in their most statistically favored rotamer positions (Ponder & Richards, 1987). The resulting model with 337 atoms was used as the starting model for the restrained least-squares refinement. All the refinement was carried out using the PROLSQS software package of Hendrickson modified by Sheriff (1987) to include van der Waals restraints on symmetry relations. One cycle of refinement required approximately 25 min of central processing unit (c.p.u.) time on a Vaxstation 3500. The program PROTINS was used to impose intermolecular non-bonded contacts. Restraints on distance, non-bonded contacts, chiral volume and planarity were imposed on additional solute molecules such as glycerol, phosphate and acetate during the refinement. Nonbonded restraints were imposed on the water molecules. Table 1 summarizes the course of the refinement and Table 2 gives the final refinement parameters. Each round of refinement consisted of a session of model building followed by refinement to convergence. Five rounds of refinement were performed. Typical remodeling included side-chain conformation modification and modeling of new solvent sites. Refinement began with the data above 2o up to 2.4/~. After the second round, all the data (above 2or) to 2.25/~, were added.

The Fo-Fc map produced after the frst 26 cycles of refinement (round 1) showed clearly new conformations for residues 27 and 42 which are different from those of c~1-PT. Asp42 could be fit into the cleft formed by the residues Phe43 and Pro40 in a similar conformation as in crambin. Appropriate changes to these residues along with a minor correction to Lys5 were made during round 2. The side chains of residues such as Argl9, Lysl, Lys32, Lys23 and Lys41 attained new conformations which may be ascribed to the difference in contacts between (~I-PT and /3-PT molecules in the crystals. These side chains were modeled during rounds 3 and 4.

BOGUSLAW STEC, USHA RAO AND MARTHA M. TEETER 2.4. Solvent~solute modeling Criteria used to model the solvent structure evolved during the course of refinement. The initial water model of/;t-PT was predicted using a template for water around polar groups in proteins derived from the analysis of crystal structures at 1.4,& or better resolution (Roe & Teeter, 1993). This method can be useful for an initial crystallographic refinement of water as well as for model building in general. Templates for water prediction had been derived from high-resolution structures by superimposing the hydrogen-bonding groups around Arg, Glu, Asp, Asn and Gin. The waters around these residues were added to the structure that had been refined to convergence without water. The R-factor dropped by 2% when these water positions were refined and all but two out of 22 waters added were found to be correct. Subsequent water positions were modeled by inspecting the F,,-F,. electron density and if a peak fell within 2.5 to 3.5,& of an atom of the model that was capable of hydrogen bonding, the peak was accepted as a site for solvent. Only the first shell of the solvent was modeled in the beginning. As in the case of ~ - P T , large peaks of difference densities were observed on the polar face of the protein. An acetate ion was modeled at the intersection of two twofold axes. In the density close to Tyrl3, an MPD* molecule was introduced at first. MPD was used in crystallization and was thought to have the correct shape and number of atoms to fit the density. Unfortunately, after 25 cycles of refinement the tetrahedrai group of disubstituted carbon of the MPD molecule was flattened and distorted, and showed imperfect fit to the density. After careful inspection of the densities and possible head groups of phospholipids, a glycerol molecule was modeled at this site and it refined very well (Fig. 2). The electron-density maps with improved phases clearly

showed a new conformation for the glycerol as compared with cr]-PT. The 0 2 atom bound in ~ - P T to the Gin22 formed a hydrogen bond to the NZ of symmetry-related Lys45 in /;/-PT. The discussion of the possible sources of glycerol was presented in the previous paper (Rao, Stec & Teeter, 1995). The two positions at which we had detected the secbutanol in c~I-PT were carefully inspected. The density at the hydrophobic face which corresponded to secbutanol in ~ - P T was larger. Thus, we modeled a second glycerol molecule at this site. Since our crystallization solution did not contain sec-butanol, the other secbutanol position, close to the N terminus, proved not to be occupied. The modeling of a phosphate ion was also not entirely straightforward. The shape of the electron density at the location that corresponded to a phosphate ion in ~ - P T was not indicative of a phosphate ion at the beginning. However at stage 3. a phosphate ion was modeled at this site. Introduction of phosphate along with 35 cycles of refinement at round 3 resulted in a final R factor of 17.8% at 2.25 ,&. Elevated temperature factors for the phosphate ion and weaker electron density as compared to ~ - P T suggests that it is possible that phosphate was partially replaced by sulfate. After addition of all the data to 1.7 resolution at stage 4 and 5 and two modeling sessions, the R factor refined to the level of 19.8%. At stage 4 side chains of Lys23 and Lys32 were corrected as indicated by the density at 1.7 A. At stage 5 an additional acetate molecule was added at the charged cluster near Arg30. The final model has a total of 439 atoms including 337 protein atoms, 77 waters, two glycerol molecules, two acetates and one phosphate.

/:/-PUROTHIONIN AT 1.7 The dihedral angles of the main chain as well as the side chains generally conform well to their expected values. All of the side-chain conformations (X~,X2) are in allowed regions of Ponder & Richards' library (1987) except four arginines, Argl0, Argl7, Argl9 and Arg30. This deviation of arginines can be explained in terms of crystal contacts or similarities to crambin. In general, the electron density for the model is excellent (Fig. 4). All of the backbone atoms have uniquely defined positions by the density. Even for the long side chains such as those of arginines, all the atoms, especially atoms in guanidinium groups are clearly visible. Only Arg30 and Lys41 seem to have weaker densities. Weak negative difference electron density was observed on Asn27 and Asp42. This fact plus relatively high temperature factors for those side chains suggests that these crystals may be a mixed form of a l - and ~t_ purothionins in the fl-lattice. Only those two residues are distinct enough to show the differences in sequence between the two forms. An attempt was made to establish the ratio by refining occupancy of those residues. The final occupancy was ,~,80% for/3-PT The temperature factor versus residue profile (Fig. 5) shows the same type of mobility in both structures and is reminiscent of that for crambin. The temperature factors of fl-PT are slightly higher than those of aI-PT (Fig. 5) as well as those of additional solute molecules. This may be attributed both to the fact that fl-PT crystals appear to be a mixture of two forms (see above) and to the looser packing for helix 2 in fl-PT lattice. Variation in crystal contacts from crystal to crystal can also explain a relatively high Rmerge between both data sets. 3.2. Description of the structure The secondary structure of fl-PT and overall folding is the same as that of a l-PT (Teeter et al., 1990; Rao et al., 1995). The al- and [3-PT structures resemble that of crambin, with the general shape of the Greek capital letter gamma (P). The vertical stem (Fig. 6) is comprised of two antiparallel a-helices, and the horizontal arm has a coil in extended conformation and a short

1992a,b) showed the decorrelation (difference between the main and the test data sets) in an acceptable range (~,10%) with RMai, = 19.96% and Rfre~ = 28.13%. A Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) shown in Fig. 3 gives a nearly ideal fit of 0.22/~ for positional errors in atomic coordinates. The r.m.s, deviation in distances from ideal values falls close to or within targeted variances (see Table 2). Only ,-,,5% of all distances in the three categories tabulated in P ROLS Q fall two standard deviations outside of their ideal values. The r.m.s, deviation of atoms of planar groups from their fitted planes is 0.008 A, which is well within the targeted value of 0.015 ,&. No planar deviation is beyond two standard deviations of the target variance. The low variance in planar groups reflects, to a large extent, the tight distribution of the ~ torsion angle of about 180 °. Since a wider ~-angle distribution is found in highly refined structures like crambin (Teeter, Roe, & Heo, 1993) as well as in polypeptides (Ashida, Tsungoae, Tanaka & Yamane, 1991), the restraints were relaxed to 5.0 ,&.

Since the present structure is of higher resolution than that of ~ - P T , an attempt is made to classify different secondary-structural units including the different types of turns. As shown in Table 4 and Fig. 7, the globular fold of/4-PT consists of an antiparallel pair of helices (residues 7-18 and 22-28) and two stranded 14-sheet (residues 1-4, 31-34 and 45), an extended coil region (residues 38-39) and five turns (residues 5-6, 19-21, 29-30, 35-37 and 40-44). The assignment and average distances of hydrogen bonds formed in different structural units are listed in Table 4. For comparison with crambin refer to Table 4 in Teeter et al. (1993). 3.2.1. Helices. Two c~-helices are found in f3-PT (Fig. 7a), one with three turns (termed helix HI, residues 7-18) and the other with two turns (termed helix H2, residues 22-28). The mean torsion angles (qo,~) of helices H1 and H2 are (-63.4, -39.2 °) and (-69.4, -43.6°), respectively. Those dihedrals are slightly different from those seen in crambin (-62.1, -39.9 °) and (-69.6, -32.0 °) indicating a different environment for

There are four short strands in the structure each containing one to four residues (residues 1--4, 32-34, 38-39 and 46 for the strands S1, $2, $3 and $4 respectively). Three of them are hydrogen bonded and form an antiparallei /~-sheet (S1-$2, $2-$4; Fig. 7b) with hydrogen bonds listed in Table 3. The $3 strand is not involved in intramolecular sheet formation but is involved in intermolecular contacts (Fig. 8). The average (~,~/~) torsion angles over all /3-strand residues are (-116.5, 145.7°). 3.2.3. Turns. There are five turns in the structure of ¢4-PT (residues 5-6, 19-21, 30-31, 35-37, 40 44 for turns TI to T5). Turns T4 and T5 are similar to those of crambin. T5 is a classical type I/3-turn (see Fig. 7c). It has a weak hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of Pro40 and amide N atom of Phe43 (3.12 A). The T2 turn between the H1 and H2 helices is considerably different from that in crambin but very similar to that in (~I-PT. In crambin, due to the presence of Pro at position 19, this turn is a classical type I/3-turn. But in fl-PT, the deletion of one residue together with the residue change from Prol9 to Argl9 is responsible for the change in conformation of this turn to an t~-helical turn (ni---,ni+ 4 hydrogen bonding) with the carbonyl O atom of C y s l 6 bonding to the amide N atom of Gly20 (Fig. 7d). The T3 turn constitutes another example of a turn architecture where ni----~ni+ 5 residues form a hydrogen bond which is reminiscent of the 7r helix bonding pattern.

hydrophilic (it is primarily polar but involves some van der Waals contacts). Interaction D is the strong polar dimer contact between the residues of the first helices of a molecule with the corresponding residues of the twofold symmetryrelated molecule. As seen in Table 5, the protein-protein interaction in this dimer is both through intermolecular hydrogen bonds between two aspargines, Asn l l and Asn l4 and through van der Waals contact between the CG atoms of symmetry-related Argl0 and CG of Leu 15. But a number of other polar and charged residues such as Lysl, Lys45, Argl0, Ser38 and the carboxy terminus are exposed to the interface between the two monomers in this dimer. As a result, several solvent and solute molecules such as acetate, phosphate ion, glycerol and several water molecule are bound here which further strengthen the interactions in this dimer (see below).

(a) 3.3. Crystal packing The essential features of the overall crystal packing have been discussed in the previous publication (Teeter et al., 1990) but are repeated here because of key solute reported here mediating these interactions. In brief, there are four kinds of intermolecular interactions, termed A-D, which help the molecules associate into clusters (Fig. 9a). Interaction B, because of its hydrophobic nature, forms a hydrophobic dimer whereas interaction D forms a polar dimer. Both together result in a tetrameric cluster. Because of the finding of various solutes in between the interacting surfaces, additional details have been revealed for the polar dimer interaction D. More solutemediated contacts have been found which appear critical not only for the stability of the lattice but also for the lytic activity of the molecules. 3.3.1. Dimer association. Two types of dimers can be characterized by looking at the tight contacts at the interaction sites B and D. The contact B could be called a hydrophobic dimer as it is mediated by leucine-ladder type interactions between the first helices of two molecules. The second interaction D can be called

fl-PUROTHIONIN AT 1.7/~ tetramer can also be thought of as a four-helix bundle (see Fig. 9), although the interaction between the helices is not of the conventional type (Cohen & Parry, 1990). The helices here are held by the already mentioned leucine ladders in one direction and with hydrogen bonds between aspargines in the perpendicular direction. This tetramer may be the building block or the seed for crystal growth of o~1- and fl-PT. 3.3.3. Crystal packing modification in fl-PT. Because of high sequence identity, the structures of ~ and /:t-purothionins are similar. But the small sequence differences between fl-PT and O~a-PT have significant effects on the crystal lattice. Such differences along with their consequences are discussed below. Just as ~m-PT, fl-PT crystallizes in the space group 1422 and its crystal has a similar layer-like structure having the interactions A, B, C, D and E (Rao et al., 1995). There is, however, a 3/~ difference in the c-dimension in fi-PT crystals compared to ~ - P T . This difference has an important bearing on the packing relationship between molecules. Understanding this relationship in turn may aid in finding the causes of differences between the physical properties for the two purothionin crystals. The difference in the c unit length can be explained in terms of variations in interlayer distances between the two crystals (see Fig. 9b). One of the monomers of each ~ - and /~-purothionins are superimposed in this figure and corresponding symmetry-related molecules (related by interaction C and D) are generated. It can be seen from this figure that the monomers related by interaction C ([3-PT molecules depicted in thick lines and c~-PT molecules in thin lines) move apart in c direction and this movement is about 1.6 A. The polar dimer D is almost identical in /3-PT as compared to that in ~I-PT. Since there are two such instances for one unit cell, the net increase or expansion of the cell is about 3 A in the c direction.

the backbone atoms of these residues have an r.m.s. difference in their atomic positions of 0.51 A compared to 0.36 A for all the backbone atoms. This change in the backbone contributes to the altered conformation* for Arg19 (-, -, t, +) in ft-PT rather than the (-, , , -) as seen in c~l-PT. As a result in lt-PT, the guanidinium head of this residue is oriented towards the solvent cavity. 3.4. New solute molecules essential for the lattice formation The new features of the structures that were not seen earlier are provided by the solute molecules found in both structures. All of these solute molecules are tightly bound through several contacts, the majority of them being electrostatic as well as polar. The fact that these solutes and solvents, especially phosphate and glycerol, which are located in the lattice even though they were absent in the crystallization medium, may have biological significance. Their presence may reflect the existence of a phospholipid-binding site which is important for the toxic effect exerted on the membrane. 3.4.1. Phosphate-binding site. In both o~l- and /7purothionins, there is a specific phosphate-binding site at the D interface discussed above. The polar dimer anchored by Asn l l and Asn l4 results in a site with relatively high positive electrostatic potential. The site is form6d at the center of the polar dimer due to the closeness of two symmetry-related Argl0 and two Lysl residues and the N terminus (Figs. 2 and 9). In c~l-PT, the phosphate ion binds to symmetry-related pairs of NZ atoms of Lysl. Due to the small conformational changes caused by the different packing in lt-PT, the phosphate ion causes a change in Lysl conformation which makes the direct coordination impossible (see Fig. 6 and Table 5). Phosphate in /7-PT is coordinated to two Lysl through the water molecules. 3.4.2. Glycerol-binding site. Both ~l- and /t-purothionins have a specific glycerol-binding site at the same location which is close to the phosphate-binding site. Glycerol is bound to the residues that outline the groove between the helical stem and the /t-sheet arm (Figs. 2 and 6). In both structures the 0 3 of the glycerol molecule is bound to the hydroxyl O atom of Tyrl3 and the NE of Argl7 whereas O1 is bound to Ser2 OG. There is, however, a difference between them as well. In it@T, the 0 2 of glycerol molecule is hydrogen bonded to the symmetry-related Lys45, but in c~l-PT, the glycerol 0 2 atom interacts with Gin23. Thus, we see that the rearrangement of the unit cell and compaction of the D contact causes the glycerol molecule to change a partner in the interaction. The NZ atom of Lys45

The expansion of the C interface region as a result of G l y 2 7 ~ A s n 2 7 change weakens interaction C filrther. This weakened C interaction explains several of the observed crystal properties. The/7-PT crystals are more sensitive to mechanical strain than those of c~-PT. They develop cracks along planes perpendicular to the c axis. Moreover, the crystals have a tendency to cleave along The reasons for this cell expansion have their roots in a single residue change at position 27 (Giy to Asn). Fig. 10 illustrates this point. Fig. 10(a) shows a view of the weak tetramer in ~ - P T depicting the close contact between four symmetry-related Va128 residues with a single water packed between them. Moreover, there is a van der Waals contact between the side chain of Leu24 and the C~ atom of Gly27 of another molecule which makes interaction C with the former. Fig. 10(b) shows the corresponding view i n / # P T . Here the side chain of Leu24 is in van der Waals contact with the side chain of Asn27 and not with the backbone Ccr of this residue. Two monomers making this interaction are pushed apart to accommodate the side chain of Asn27 in between and more waters are added between protein molecules. these planes and thin sections can easily be peeled off these crystals. The polar dimer interactions in both the purothionins are listed in Table 5 for comparison. One important change in this dimer for/4-PT is related to the formation of four side chain-backbone intermolecular stabilizing hydrogen bonds in addition to the two intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the side chains of Asn l l and A s n l 4 that exist in ¢~I-PT. The side chain-backbone hydrogen bonds exist between A s n l 4 ND2 and Thr7t O and between Asnl 1 ND2 and Asnl 1' O (see Table 5). Despite the conformational changes of the side chains (Table 6), the backbone atoms o f / t - P T generally match well with those of cei-PT (Fig. 6). The r.m.s, deviation between the positions of the backbone atoms of cry- and /4-purothionins is 0.36 A whereas a difference of 0.94 is observed when all the homologous side chains are also included in the calculation. There are, however, a few minor differences in the backbone of residues 33-37 of the floppy loop and in residues Argl9 and Gly20 of the turn between the helices. There is about a +20 ° difference in ~ angles of these residues compared to those in c~l-PT. Moreover,

/:~-PUROTHIONIN AT 1.7/~, this crucial residue. The iodination would disrupt the glycerol and the phospholipid binding thus making the protein impotent towards membranes. To elucidate the details of these important interactions we have carried out NMR experiments on binding inorganic phosphates and glycerol-3-phosphate and small phospholipid analogs (Markman et al., 1992). Further the NMR three-dimensional structure determination of the C~l-PT-glycerol-3-phosphate complex is in process. The results, which will be presented elsewhere, indicate that this site is indeed the phospholipid binding site. Thus, although preliminary, these results seem to support the crystallographic finding suggesting that the phosphatebinding site is not an artifact of the symmetry of the crystal lattice, but indeed related to the toxicity of these proteins.* The authors wish to thank the NIH (GM 38114 and GM 40601) for support of this research and Dr B. Jones for the purified proteins. We also thank O. Markman for reading the manuscript and conducting the NMR experiments.

is more positively charged and a better donor for a hydrogen bond. 3.4.3. Acetate-binding site. Disordered acetate found in both C~l- and f3-PTs is located in the four-helical bundle formed by four symmetry-related molecules. The presence of the acetate is reminiscent of the four-helix bundle of cytochrome B in which the heme group is found in the middle. Each disordered acetate forms hydrogen bonds to two symmetry-related Asn 11 residues protruding toward the center (N Asn 11 to O Ace, 2.7/~). In such a location, it helps to neutralize this extremely positively charged molecule (+9) and contributes to the stability of the lattice. We may conclude that without those negatively charged solute molecules (phosphate and acetate) placed on the symmetry elements it would be impossible to form the C~l-PT crystals. The intermolecular side-chain interactions which are responsible for the packing with their updated distances are listed in Table 5. 4. Summary The structure determination of f~-PT at higher resolution (1.7/~) than oI-PT (2.5/~) has opened a new vista to understanding more about thionins in general. The initial failures in obtaining high-quality crystals of [3PT and then the difficulties in handling the crystals once they were obtained led us to not only look for crystal-stabilizing factors but also to look into the root causes of these crystal properties. Rerefinement of a I-PT followed by the parallel refinement of f3-PT in the final stages of c~1-PT refinement proved complementary and facilitated locating many critical solute particles in the lattice. The importance of the phosphate and acetate ions in stabilizing both crystals has thus been investigated. Although the structure of fiLPT has overall similarity to that of C~l-PT, there is a key difference between the two in crystal packing. The c dimension of the former is larger than that of the latter by 3 ~, and this expansion, originating from a change of residue 27 (Gly~Asn), has been attributed to the altered space between stacking layers of tetrameric molecules. Consequently, some of the side chains have different conformations and the crystals have different properties. The non-homologous amino acids are responsible for the toxins specificity toward different phospholipids (GarciaOlmedo, Rodriquez-Palenzuela, Hernandez-Lucas, Ponz & Marana, 1989). Thus, the conformational changes might be pertinent to the modulation of biological activity. Modeling may clarify this difference further. The finding that phosphate ions and glycerol molecules bind to purothionins has led us to believe that it may be relevant to biological activity of the thionins. It is reasonable to assume that those moieties are indicators of the phospholipid-binding site. Experimental support for this hyphothesis comes from Wada, Ozaki, Matsubara & Yoshizumi (1982) and Evans, Wang, Shaw & Vernon (1988). They showed that the toxins lose their toxicity when Tyrl3 is iodinated. In our structure the glycerol molecule is bound to
