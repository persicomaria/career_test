PATRICIA C. WEBER', A. HOWARD', NGWEN Huu XUONG' AND F. R. SALEMME~ University `Department of Biochemistry of Arizona, Tucson, Ark. 85721, U.S.A. and `Departments of Physics, Chemistry and Biology University of California at San Diego La Jolla, Calif. 92093, U.S.A. (Received 2 June 1981) This paper describes the 2.5 A crystallographic structure determinrttion of ferricytochrome c' from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodoqirillum moliechianum. The molecule is a symmetric dimer, with esch 12%residue polypeptide chain incorporating a covalently bound protoheme IX prosthetic group. The monomeris structurally orgenixedae an array of four nearly parallel LYhelices,which pack most closely at one end and thereafter spatially diverge to accommodatethe heme prosthetic group. Although local features of the heme
attachment pattern resemble those seen in cytochrome c, the heme iron in

cytochrome c' is pentaco-ordinate with a solvent-exposed histidine residue furnishing the singleaxial ligand to the hemeiron. Subunit associationin the dimeric moleculeis principally stabilized by helix
interactions, which are qualitatively similar to those occurring within eclch

monomer.Theseinteractions result in a dimer geometry that situatesthe exposed regionsof both hemes on the same molecular surface.
The structural basis for some of the physiochemical properties cytochrome c' are examined and compared to those of other heme proteins of known structure.

1. Introduction
The cytochromes c' are a widely diversified classof proteins derived from a variety of denitrifying and photosynthetic bacteria (Bartsch, 1978). In general, these molecules are isolated as dimers composed of identical subunits of M, - 14,000. Each subunit incorporates a protoheme IX prosthetic group covalently bound to the polypeptide via thioether linkages formed by the condensation of two cysteine side-chains with the heme vinyl groups. The oxidoreduction midpoint potentictl for various speciesof cytochrome c' ranges from 0 to + 140 mV. The heme iron exhibits high-spin spectroscopic properties in both oxidation states (Ehrenberg & Kemen, 1965) and, in the ferrous form, can bind smrtll uncharged ligands (Teniguchi C%

Kamen, 1963; Gibson & Kamen, 1966; Cusanovich & Gibson, 1973). The similarity of these latter properties with those of the globins prompted Vernon and Kamen to name the protein pseudohemoglobin when it was first isolated in 1954 (Vernon & Kamen, 1954). The name of the protein subsequently evolved to RHP (Rhodospoirillum Heme Protein ; Horio & Kamen, 1961), cryptocytochrome c (Suzuki & Iwasaki, 1962) and cytochromoid c (Dus & Kamen, 1963) as it became evident that some of its molecular properties resembled those of mitochondrial cytochrome c. The name cytochrome cc' was used when the protein was thought to contain both a low-spin heme, which transferred electrons, and a high-spin heme, which bound ligands. This proposal was based on the observation that reduced cytochrome c' exhibits a split Soret absorption band, thus suggesting the presence of spectroscopically different heme prosthetic groups (Bartsch et al., 1971). However, this suggestion was ruled out by the subsequent discovery of a monomeric cytochrome c' from Rhodopseudomonas palustris exhibiting the same spectral characteristics as the dimeric proteins (Dus et al., 1967), together with sequence data showing that the dimeric molecules were composed of identical polypeptide chains (Kennel et al., 1972; Ambler, 1973). The present name, cytochrome c', is derived from the covalent mode of heme attachment and proposed function as an electron transport protein. The prime is used to distinguish these high-spin heme proteins from the low-spin mitochondrial cytochromes c. It has been shown that the cytochromes c' constitute a structurally unique family of c-type cytochromes, whose overall tertiary fold bears little resemblance to that of either the mitochondrial cytochromes c or the globins (Weber et al., 1980). Comparative features of cytochrome c' with molecules having similar architecture have been described (Weber & Salemme, 1980). Further comparisons have been made between cytochrome c' and Escherichia coli cytochrome b562 (Weber et al., 1981). The initial structural description of R. molischianum cytochrome c' was based on interpretation of a 2.5 A resolution electron density map (Weber et al., 1980). Here we describe the structure determination in more detail, and present an improved molecular model based on both reassessmentof the isomorphous replacement data and model fitting in (2Fo - #`,)a - talc electron density maps. The structural basis for some of the physicochemical properties of the cytochromes c' are examined and compared to those of some other heme proteins of known structure.

2. Materials
(a) Preparation

and Methods

of cystuls and heavy-atom derivative8 R. mdiachianum ferricytochrome c' crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P2,2i2, (a = 565 A, b = 71.7 A, c = 754 A) with the dimeric molecule, M, N 28,000, in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (Weber t Salemme, 1977). Approximately 75 potential derivatives were prepared by adding portions of concentrated heavy-atom solutions to a crystal in 65% saturated (NH&SO,+, @l r+r-Mg(NOs)2. Five of these, each soaked for 2 to 5 CM m~-K&C16 or days in either 1.5mlrr-IrNHJ, 8.1 miu-SmSO,, 0.03 mnr-UOa(NO&, 03 mar-KzHgI, (molarities calculated assuming complete solubility of the heavy-metal complex) were used to collect multiple isomorphous replacement data.

(b) Data coZZection X-ray intensity data were measured on a multiwire area detector diffractometer (Cork rf aZ., 1973; Xuong et al., 1978). Data were collected to 2.5 A resolution on crystals of the native protein and 5 derivatives during 2 data collection sessions totelling about 25 days. One crystal was used for each data set. (Crystals mounted in borosilicate glass capillaries were aligned optically on a triple axis goniometer. The crystal orientation was initially determined by viewing diffraction patterns on a video monitor displaying the detector output. Orientation and unit cell parameters were subsequently refined by collecting rough data and minimizing differences between the observed and predicted scanning angles. X-ray intensities were measured in still exposures of t.he crystal, which was rotated in 0.08" to 010" steps about the 4 or o axis. Owing to the fact that the multiwire chamber can detect reflections considerably above and below the horizontal plane, data were usually collected at x = w = 0". Throughout data collection, the multiwire chamber was set 381 mm from the crystal, at an angle of 20" between the incident beam and chamber normal, with the entire diffracted beam path enclosed in a helium-filled box. The power of the Cu X-ray source was adjusted to maintain the total chamber counting rate below approx. 20,000 &s/s. The exposure time per frame averaged 45 s for crystals approx. 0.3 mm3 in volume. Data collection was divided into blocks consisting of approx. 750 frames. Within a block. counts for a reflection observed in any given exposure were summed with counts in contiguous exposures. For weak reflections, three successive exposures were summed, five exposures were used for moderately bright reflections, and seven for very bright reflections. The remainder of the reflection's intensity was estimated with a Gaussian. The background of each intensity measurement was determined by averaging counts at the reflection's position on the chamber for 16 exposures before the reflection came into diffracting position. The integrated intensities were corrected for Lorentz and polarization effects, then scaled together on the basis of replicate observations recurring in 1 or more data blocks. Typically, each independent reflection was measured 6 times in a given data set containing approx. 68.000 intensities. Scaling R-factors and other data collection statistics have been summarized elsewhere (Weber et al., 1980). (c) Initial phase calculation and rejhement Isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering information from 2 derivatives, K,PtC& and K,HgI,, were utilized in phase determination. Structure factors for which F2 < 0 of P2 and data at Bragg spacings less than 20 A resolution were eliminated from the calculations. Derivative data were scaled to the parent using both linear and exponential factors in order to compensate for intercrystal differences in overall scattering magnitude and temperature factor, then resealed to account for their greater overall scattering due to the presence of heavy atoms (Kraut et al., 1962). Heavy-atom positions were initially determined by interpretation of 44 A resolution difference Patterson maps, which could be solved for 1 site in the platinum derivative and 2 in the mercury derivative. Single isomorphous replacement phases calculated from 1 mercury site were used to generate difference Fouriers for both derivatives in order to locate all heavy-atom sites within a common origin system. Multiple isomorphous replacement phase refinement was carried out by the conventional least-squares minimization of 1 IkFH(obs) - FH(calc)l' in alternate cycles of phase calculation and refinement of heavy-atom parameters.`Refinement was initiated at 4.4 d resolution using the platinum site and both mercury sites. Subsequent refinement cycles including data to 2.5 A incorporated anomalous dispersion contributions as described by Matt,hews (1966). The mean figure of merit was 072 for reflections phased to 2.5 A resolution (Weher pf al., 1980). (d) Interpretation of electron density maps The correct structural enantiomorph was determined by computing summed anomalous plus heavy-atom difference Fouriers using phases calculated from both hands of the heavy-

atom derivatives. The correct enantiomorph gave a greater integrated electron density when peaks were summed from both maps of a given phase set (Blundell & Johnson, 1976). In a 60 A resolution electron density map of 2 unit cells, both the molecular envelope of the dimer and relative orientations of each subunit were clearly defined. The subunit connectivity wa8 established in a 4@ map, in which the rods of density seen at 66 A could A be identified as m-helices. Heme iron atom8 were located at this stage by inspection of a native anomalous dispersion difference Fourier. A 2.5 A electron density map was subsequently calculated and contoured at 2 cm/A scale onto acetate sheets stretched across aluminium frames. The frames were stacked in a horizontal optical comparator (Richards, 1968), where a Kendrew skeletal model of the cytochrome c' dimer was constructed. Model building was begun at the heme group, then proceeded toward the amino terminus. Similar region8 of the crystallographically independent subunits were built concurrently to facilitate fitting the known amino acid sequence (Ambler, 1979) into the density. The course of the polypeptide chain was unambiguous in the electron density map, although density was weak for the amino and carboxy termini of both subunits. Atomic co-ordinates were meclsured using an electromechanical superpositioning device (Salemme & Fehr, 1972).

(e) Final phasecalculatti and refinement
Although it was noted early in the structure determination that the mercury heavy-atom sites were near the heme prosthetic groups, the special position of the platinum site on the molecular diad was not recognized until the Kendrew model had been constructed. Owing to the possible functional importance of these locations, the heavy-atom binding sites were examined in more detail A platinum difference Fourier, computed using phases calculated from the model co-ordinates, showed a single spherical peak, indicating that this site had been adequately approximated by a single occupancy and isotropic temperature factor. However, the same approximation was less accurate for the K8Hg1, derivative, whose central mercury atom and iodide ligands were clearly defined in the mercury derivative difference Fourier. Co-ordinates for the individual atoms in each HgI; complex were determined and incorporated into the joint phase refinement. Refinement at 2.5 A resolution was terminated when the mercury derivative began to dominate the phasing, SLY evidenced by an increase in the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) closure error for the platinum derivative and a continuing decrease in the r.m.8. closure error for the mercury derivative. The closure error and site parameters for the platinum derivative were then fixed, and the 2.5 A to 2.3 A single isomorphous replacement data of the mercury derivative incorporated into the joint phase refinement.The mean figure of merit for 10,541 reflections to 25 A resolution is 979. The final multiple isomorphous replacement refinement statistics and heavy-atom parameters for both derivative8 are listed in Table I. (f) Final model building using computergraphics Comparison of Fourier map sections showed that the refinement incorporating the KIHgI, derivative as a number of discrete scatterers produced an improved electron density map. The structure wae consequently rebuilt from the final (20 to 2.3 A) electron density map using an MMSX computer graphics system (Barry et al., 1974). This final map showed strongly defined density for both the polypeptide backbone and the majority of side-chains (Fig. 1) and was signiticantly improved in the vicinity of the heme groups (Fig. 2). The model was further improved by refitting the four carboxy and four amino-terminal residues of both subunits in a (2F,- F&X- talc map generated from co-ordinates for the remainder of the structure. In addition, some side-chains and part.8 of the non-helical polypeptide backbone were adjusted by examination of both (2F, - F,)a-talc and (Fo - Fcb - talc electron density maps. Although subunits in the cytochrome c' dimer are symmetrically related by a 2-fold rotation axis, the non-crystallographic symmetry was not utilized for the purposes o'f map

which is doubly connected at one end by the AB and CD helix interconnections, and singly connected at the other by the BC interhelix loop. The helix axes most closely approach each other at the double connected end of the bundle, and thereafter spatially diverge to form a binding pocket for the heme prosthetic group (Weber & Salemme, 1980). As shown in Figures 4 and 5, the amino-terminal residues 1 through 4 have essentially extended conformations and are rather poorly defined in the electron density map relative to the remainder of the structure. The first (A) helix incorporates 21 amino acid residues, and is initiated and terminated with proline residues 5 and 25. Sequence positions Ile26 through Ala38 form a 13-residue loop interconnecting the A helix with the 17-residue B helix. The 23 successive residues form a "U-shaped" BC loop, which caps the divergent end of the helix bundle and forms a protein barrier between the heme prosthetic group and solvent. The C helix incorporates 22 amino acid residues, and is connected to the D helix with the fiveresidue (101 to 105) CD loop. The D helix includes residues 106 to 115.

containing the diagonally related A and C helix axes. The heme is displaced from the center of the bundle both toward the molecular exterior in the AC helix diagonal plane, and toward the D helix, normal to the AC diagonal plane. As a result, the heme group is situated in an asymmetric environment with one face relatively exposed to solvent and the other oriented toward the molecular interior. The heme group is covalently bound to the polypeptide via the Cys-Lys-Ala-CysHis sequence of residues. The side-chains of cysteines 118 and 121 form thioether linkages to the heme vinyl groups of pyrole rings I and II, respectively (numbering of the heme pyrole rings is shown in Fig. 4). Both thioether linkages have S chiral configuration. The heme iron is ligated by four pyrole nitrogens in the porphyrin plane. The Ns2 atom of the His122 imidazole forms an axial covalent bond to the heme iron. The sixth iron axial ligation site is not occupied by an atom from a protein side-chain. Figure 6 shows stereoscopic views of the covalent linkages and other side-chains surrounding the heme prosthetic group. Hydrophobic residues Leul9 and Leu89 contact pyrole I on the interior heme face. Nearly all of the aromatic residuesnear the heme group, Trp58, Phe82, Trp86 and Phe125, are clustered near pyrole rings II and III. The side-chain of Trp86 is situated approximately parallel to the heme plane and within van der Waals' contact of pyrole II. At the opposite heme edge, the side-chain of Trp23 packs perpendicular to pyrole I. Methionine 16, adjacent to pyrole III, is the residue closest to the sixth axial ligation site of the heme iron, although there is no evidence that the methionine sulfur forms a co-ordinate bond with the heme iron. In contrast to the close packing of residues about the interior face and sides of the porphyrin plane, views of the heme plane from the side having the covalent linkages show that this face is partially exposed to solvent (Fig. 6(a)).

Other than the heme binding residues, only Lys126 packs near the exterior face of the heme group. The heme propionates are oriented toward the molecular surface (Figs 4 and 5). The mure exposed propionate of pyrole ring IV interacts with two side-chains, Gln13 located on the A helix of the same subunit and LyslO on the A helix of the dyad-related subunit. The second heme propionate forms a salt link with Argl2 of the same molecular subunit.

Pairs of antiparallel helices (A and B) from each subunit interact at the molecular interface to form an AA'BB' bundle, whose antiparallel, left-twisted arrangement of adjacent helicea is similar to that observed within the individual subunits.

each monomer (Fig. 8). The helices within the cytochrome c' subunit are packed with their points of closest interhelical contact near one end of the helix bundle. In contrast, the dyad-related AA' and BB' helix pairs pack symmetrically, so that vectors connecting their points of closest interhelix approach are clustered both near the center of the helix bundle and near the molecular dyad symmetry axis. Figure 9 shows the symmetric helix interactions that occur between subunits of the cytochrome c` dimer. Most residues at the subunit interface are hydrophobic and none is aromatic. At the AA' interface, symmetric packing interactions are formed between the two Leu15 side-chains, and between Leull of one helix and Gln17 and Thrl8 of the other. The short interaxis separation of 6.1 A between the A and A' helices reflects the interaction of symmetrically related Gly14 residues at the point of closest approach. This and the relatively acute interaxial angle (Table 2) appear to reflect optimization of interhelical side-chain packing in situations where the most closely interacting residues have small side-chains (Richmond & Richards. 1978). At the BB' interface, symmetric interactions are formed between Va150 and Leu53, and dyad-related methionine residues at position 49. In addition, two pairs of oppositely charged amino acid side-chains are situated in positions where they could potentially form a pair of intersubunit salt linkages. Although the electron density for these side-chains is somewhat ambiguous, computer graphics

manipulation suggests the absence of any steric obstacles to formation of a pair of salt linkages between Lys52 of one monomer and Glu45 of the other. In summary, the interaction between the subunits of cytochrome c' appears to principally reflect extensive hydrophobic packing interactions between residues of the A and B helices of each monomer. With the exception of the potential intersubunit salt links formed between Lys52 and Glu45, and the more well-defined salt links between the side-chain of LyslO and one of the heme propionates (described above), there appears otherwise to exist few alternative intersubunit ionic or hydrogen-bonded interactions.

(d) Overall arrangement

of the dimeric molecule

The cytochrome c' dimer is organized as an extended array of eight closely packed a-helices. Six of these, D, C, B, B', c' and D', form a continuous twisted sheet having pronounced curvature (Figs 7 and 8). The concave side provides a hydrophobic packing surface for the A helices, interconnecting loops and heme prosthetic groups. The heme groups are oriented so that the proximal histidine ligands point away from the molecular dyad axis. The angle between heme planes is 42", with an iron to iron distance of 24 A. The heme groups are rotated so that the heme propionates are nearly co-parallel ; i.e. when the two heme groups are viewed parallel to the iron-iron vector, the heme propionates of one heme are nearly parallel to those of the other heme in the dimer (Fig. 5(c)). The organization of subunits in the cytochrome c' dimer results in a molecule having distinctly different molecular faces. Owing to the preferential orientation of the interhelix connecting loops toward the "heme" face of each subunit, this surface of the dimer is populated primarily with residues in extended or hairpin

bend conformation. In contrast, the opposite surface of the dimer is primarily populated by side-chains from the B, C and D helices of each subunit. (e) Distribution of charged residues

Each cytochrome c' subunit contains 18 positively charged and 16 negatively charged groups contributed from polypeptide side-chains and termini. The heme prosthetic group also incorporates two propionic acid side-chains, so that the R. molischianum cytochrome c' dimer has an equal number of negatively and positively charged side-chains. Figure 10 shows the distribution of charged residues about the surface of the dimer. Within the monomer, charge pairs or hydrogen bonds are observed between Argl2 and one of the heme propionates, the side-chains of Asp39 and Arg43, Glu69 and Gln27, Lys71 and Glu124, Glu84 and Lys87, Glu92 and Glnl 10. As described above, salt links between subunits include the interaction between one of the heme propionates and LyslO, and potentially between Glu45 and Lys52.

FIG. 10. Projected distribution of charged residues on the molecular surface of the R. moli.schianuw~ cytochrome c' dimer. Approximate position of the positively cherged side-chains and ammo termini are indicated by labeled filled circles; broken circles indicate negatively charged side-chains and carboxy termini. Solid thick lines between residues of opposite charge indicate salt links (charged h&roatom interatomic contacts < 35 A) observed in the crystallographic structure; dotted l&s indicate possible charge pairs.

As shown in Figure 10, charged residues are quite evenly distributed about the molecular surface formed by the B, C and D helices. In contrast, the greater total number of charges on the "heme" face have a lessuniform distribution. Residuesof either charge cluster below the heme group, whereas the region proximal to the periphery of the exposed heme group appears to be largely populated by positively charged groups. (f) Heavy-atom sites The platinum heavy-atom site in cytochrome c' is situated on the molecular dyad axis between the two B helices. Examination of the structure in this region suggests that the platinum atom is complexed with the sulfur atoms of two dyad-related

methionine residues (Met49). Additional side-chains in the vicinity are dyad-related lysine residues at sequence position 52. Although the available maps do not show well-defined density interpretable as chloride or ammonium substituents to the platinum (Petsko et aZ., 1978), the observed binding pattern suggests that the initial association between PtClg- may be promoted by ionic interactions with the lysine side-chains, followed by subsequent reaction of the methionine sulfur atoms with the platinum. The two mercury heavy-atoms bind in identical orientations to the exposed faces of the heme prosthetic groups (Fig. 7). Although the mercury derivative was originally prepared from a solution of K,HgI,, only three iodide ligands are observed in the heavy-atom difference Fourier, and no indication of additional ligands was found at lower density levels. Nevertheless, neither HgI; ion has planar geometry, but instead forms a trigonal pyramid with the mercury atom lying about 05 A from the plane defined by the iodide substituents (Table 3). Two

of the iodide ligands are roughly centered over porphyrin pyrole rings, with the imidazole ring of the fifth axial heme iron ligand between them (Fig. 7). The third iodide, positioned opposite the imidazole ring, points toward the A helix. The most tightly bound iodide, 11 (as judged by having the smallest relative temperature factor in both refined sites), is positioned over pyrole I and midway between the heme plane, the sulfur atom of Cysll8, and N61 of His122 (Table 4). The position of the mercury iodide site on cytochrome C' is similar to those observed in the structural determinations of some mitochondrial cytochromes c (Takano et al., 1973 ; Tanaka et al., 1975) in which the mercury iodide sites were located near the second cysteine of the Cys-X-X-Cys-His heme binding sequence. However, the heme to HgI; interaction is more similar to that observed in metmyoglobin (Scouloudi & Prothero, 1965; Kretsinger et al., 1968). In both molecules, the HgI; is within van der Waals' distance of the heme group and forms close contacts between at least one iodide and a porphyrin pyrole. However, the complexes adopt different orientations relative to the heme groups. In cytochrome c', the HgI; complex is rotated roughly 120" about 11 relative to the complex with myoglobin, so resulting in an additional pyrole-iodide interaction (12 and pyrole IV). The HgI; complexes also assume different orientations relative to the heme

planes in the two molecules. In myoglobin, the plane of the iodide atoms and heme ring are parallel (Scouloudi & Prothero, 1965; Kretsinger et al., 1968), whereas in cytochrome c' the iodide plane is oriented 50" from the heme plane. While differences in the orientation of the HgI; relative to the porphyrin may reflect differences in the packing environments of the myoglobin and cytochmme c' heme groups, the differences in observed geometry of the complex also apparently reflect the hydrophobicity of the binding site. In myoglobin, the planar HgI, complex is situated in the hydrophobic interior of the molecule. This geometry is similar to that observed for the crystal structure of (CH3)sSHg13, which suggests the preference for planar geometry in an environment of low dielectric constant (Fenn et al., 1963; Fenn, 1966). In contra.& the cytochrome c' heme group is relatively exposed to solvent, a situation that might promote the stabilization of a more tetrahedral geometry (Table 3). The apparent specificity of HgI; binding to cytochrome c' suggests that it may constitute a useful probe in spectroscopic or magnetic resonance studies aimed at investigations of the electronic and conformational state of the cytochrome c' heme and its environment. Moreover, the binding of HgI; to myoglobin has been studied as a model system for heme enzymes whose substrates may interact directly with the porphyrin ring (LaMar & Budd, 1979).

4. Discussion
(a) Sequence diversity in cytochromes c' Sequence determinations of cytochrome c' reveal a considerable extent of species diversification (Ambler, 1973,1979; Meyer et al., 1975; Ambler et al., 1979,198O). Figure 11 shows a sequence alignment similar to that previously proposed for the cytochromes cr from Rh,odo~seu&monar gelatinosa, Rhodospirillum tenue, Chromatium vinosum and Alcaligenes sp (Ambler et al., 1979), to which the

sequences of R. molischianum (Ambler, 1979) and Rhodospirillum rubrum cytochrome c' (Meyer et al., 1975) have been added. Although the cytochrome c' sequences are relatively constant in length, and the extent of identical residues between two sequences can be as high as 48% (Ambler et al., 1980), the number of sequentially conserved residues drops dramatically when larger numbers of sequences are compared (Fig. 11). Residues conserved among the cytochromes c' include Argl2, Gly61, Thr62, Leu96, Gly103, Gly115, Cysl18, Lysl19, Cys121 and His122 (numbering according to the R. molischianum cytochrome c' sequence). Four of these directly interact with the heme prosthetic group (Fig. 4). Cysteine residues 118 and 121 form thioether linkages with the heme vinyl groups and the His122 imidazole provides an axial ligand to the heme iron. The side-chain of Arg12 forms a salt link to one of the heme propionates. Other sequentially conserved residues are involved in helix contacts. Glyl15 occurs near the point of closest interaction between the A and D helices, although the residue that it packs against on the A helix (Trp23 in R. molischianum cytochrome c') is not strictly conserved. The side-chain of Leu96 is packed near Ala109, a position of the D helix that is always occupied by a small residue. Glycine 103 occurs at the middle of the tight CD interhelix connection, while Gly61 and Thr62 are sequentially adjacent residues in the BC interconnecting loop. In addition to strictly conserved residues, the cytochrome c' sequences exhibit a number of structurally conservative amino acid substitutions. In particular, the aromatic character of residues in positions 58, 75 and 125, which pack about the heme group, is largely preserved among the different cytochrome c' sequences. Similarly, a small residue always occurs in sequence position 14, where the A helices make a particularly tight interaction at the R. molischianum cytochrome c' dimer interface (Fig. 9). Although additional homology exists among charged residues in the various cytochromes c' (Fig. ll), it is notable that neither lysines 10 or 52, which are apparently involved in intersubunit salt links in R. molischianum cytochrome c', appear to be sequentially conserved in other species. However, in light of the extent of the diversity of these sequences, and the potential conformational flexibility of lysine side-chains, it is difficult to infer whether or not alternative groups may form analogous interactions in other species. In this regard, a curious feature of the cytochrome c' sequences is their high alanine content (typically 24% overall). As can be seen by inspection of Figure 11, there appears to be neither any marked tendency for alanine to occur in a-helical regions of the structure nor to be sequentially conserved between species. (b) Structural similarities with cytochrome c

The cytochromes c' and cytochromes c share a common mode of heme attachment, in which the protoheme IX is covalently bound via the formation of thioether linkages between the heme vinyl groups and cysteine side-chains furnished by a Cys-X-X-Cys-His polypeptide sequence. Given the asymmetric situation of vinyl groups about the porphyrin periphery (Fig. 4), two arrangements of thioether linkages are possible ; i.e. the first cysteine could bind either the vinyl group of pyrole I or II. Nevertheless, the heme attachment pattern is similar for

STRUCTURE

c'

cytochrome c' and the mitochondrial cytochromes c, with the first cysteine residue of the binding sequence in either case forming a linkage to the heme vinyl of pyrole I. The thioether linkages are also chirally similar, since in either molecule both the asymmetric carbons formed on condensation of the heme vinyl and cysteine side-chains possess S absolute configuration. These similarities between the heme binding in otherwise structurally different molecules may reflect a common enzymatic mechanism for the synthesis of these bonds. In this connection, it is of interest to note that in both the cytochromes c and I?, the heme is linked to a region of polypeptide that has somewhat distorted a-helical conformation (Salemme et al., 1973) at the carboxy terminus of a more regular region of a-helix. As shown in Figure 12, structural similarities between cytochrome c' and the mitochondrial cytochromes c (Dickerson et al., 1976; Salemme, 1977) are limited to the heme binding sequence and residues immediately preceding it. (c) Comparison with other high-spin heme proteins

Classes of high-spin heme proteins whose structures have been crystallographically determined include cytochrome c', cytochrome c peroxidase (Poulos et al., 1980) and the globins (Perutz, 1979). These molecules differ appreciably in their overall structures, but share a preponderance of a-helical secondary structure. In their oxidized states, the heme irons of cytochrome c peroxidase and the globins are ligated by an interior water molecule. In contrast, cytochrome C' is the first high-spin ferriheme protein whose sixth axial co-ordination site appears to be unoccupied (Fig. 2), as has been suggested by both resonance raman spectroscopy (Strekas & Spiro, 1974; Spiro et al., 1979) and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments (Emptage et al., 1981; LaMar et al., 1981). The structural characteristics of the sixth iron co-ordination site in ferricytochrome c' that appear to mitigate against the formation of a hexacoordinate species include the close packing of residues about the distal heme surface, which would sterically hinder the binding of exogenous ligands, and the lack of any internal hydrogen-bonding group capable of forming a stabilizing interaction with a bound polar ligand, such as occurs in the binding of water to metmyoglobin (Perutz, 1979). Ligand binding properties of cytochrome c' and the globins are more similar in their reduced state, insofar as both classes of molecules bind carbon monoxide. However, cytochromes c' generally have much lower CO affinities than those typically observed for globins (Cusanovich & Gibson, 1973). The lowered relative binding affinity of cytochrome c' may reflect steric hindrance at the sixth axial coordination site, since it is apparent that some relocation of the residues adjacent to this site must accompany ligand binding (Fig. 13). An additional factor that may relate to the ligand binding properties of cytochrome c', in both its oxidation states, concerns the situation of the histidine fifth axial ligand. With the notable exception of cytochrome b562 (Mathews et al., 1979; Lederer et al., 1981; Weber et aZ., 1981), this side-chain is isolated from solvent in other structurally characterized heme proteins, and forms a hydrogen bond from its unligated imidazole nitrogen (N61) to a backbone or side-chain carbonyl oxygen (Salemme et al., 1973; Valentine et al., 1979; Poulos & Kraut.

FIG. 13. A heme group superposition showing the relative situations of residues within the distal heme pockets of metmyoglobin (lighter lines) and cytochrome c' (darker lines). The water molecule (omitted) that ligates the metglobin heme iron is situated between the side-chains of Phe CD1 and Val El 1, and is additionally hydrogen-bonded to the side-chain of His E7. Residues Metl6, LeulQ and Trp86 in R. molischianum cytochrome c' are more closely packed about the 6th axial ligation site of the heme iron and contain no atom that can participate in a hydrogen bond to an axial ligane. Co-ordinates for myoglobin (Takano. 1977) were obtained from the Brookhaven Data Bank [Bernstein et aE., 1977).

1980). However, the fifth co-ordinate imidazole in cytochrome c' is exposed to solvent. Loss of the hydrogen bond to N61 could affect the delocalization of electronic charge through the imidazole ring and iron d orbital system (Peisach, 1975 ; Valentine et al., 1979) and, concomitantly, the imidazole ligand field strength (Reed et al., 1979 ; Landrum et aE., 1980). Both factors could subsequently affect the co-ordination properties of the iron at its distal ligation site. It has been proposed on the basis of electron paramagnetic spin resonance data that the electronic configuration of the heme iron in cytochrome c' reflects a quantum mechanical admixture of intermediate (3/2) and high (5/2) spin states (Maltempo, 1974; Maltempo et al., 1974). Reed et al. (1979) have suggested that the formation of a pentaco-ordinate heme complex having a weak field axial ligand is associated with the production of either mixed or high-spin iron electronic configurations. The absence of a distal water molecule, the loss of a hydrogen bond to the ligating imidazole and the apparent situation of the heme iron close to the porphyrin plane are structural features of cytochrome C' that are consistent with these proposals.

The protoporphyrin IX prosthetic group is covalently bound in similar fashion in both molecules, although the Cys-X-X-Cys-His heme binding sequence is located near the amino terminus of cytochrome c and near the carboxy terminus of cytochrome c'. The overall folds of these 2 c-type cytochromes are substantially different, thus resulting in different regions of the heme group being relatively exposed to solvent. Co-ordinates for tuna cytochrome c (Swanson et al., 1977) were obtained from the Brookhaven Data Bank (Bernstein el al., 1977).

(d) Speculations

on the functional

state of cytochrome c'

With the exception of the monomeric protein from Rhodopseudomonas palustris (Dus et al., 1967), the cytochromes c' are isolated as tightly associated dimers (Cusanovich, 1971). In R. molischianum cytochrome c', the structural basis for tight subunit association arises primarily from the extensive and intimate helix packing between subunits, and secondarily from intersubunit salt links. Given the intimate association of subunits, the cytochrome c' dimer is probably the functional molecule in tivo. Curiously, the particular spectroscopic properties that characterize isolated cytochrome c' in vitro are difficult to detect either in whole cell or chromatophore preparations, despite the relative abundance of the protein (Bartsch & Kamen, 1960; Prince et al., 1975). This may simply reflect difficulties in deconvoluting the cytochrome c' spectra in the presence of many other chromophores present in whole cells or chromatophore preparations (Smith & Ramirez, 1959; Taniguchi & Kamen, 1965; Corker & Sharpe, 1975). Alternatively, it has been proposed that cytochrome c' in wivo may be either membrane bound or complexed with another protein molecule (Dutton & Leigh, 1973), thus resulting in alteration of the molecules' spectral properties and midpoint potential (Prince et al., 1974; Kakuno et al., 1971,1973). A number of structural features of the dimeric cytochrome c' bear on this proposal. First, it is apparent that owing to the geometrical arrangement of the heme prosthetic groups in the cytochrome c' dimer, it could potentially bind a physiological oxidoreductase so as to allow simultaneous interaction with both of its heme prosthetic groups. Complex formation between cytochrome c' and a protein electron acceptor or donor might consequently be expected to result in alteration of the prosthetic group spectroscopic and oxidoreduction properties, owing to both alteration of the heme environment dielectric constant and specific interactions (e.g. hydrogen bond formation) made with the heme iron axial ligand. In this connection, a variety of studies have shown that the cytochrome c' spectra is readily solvent perturbed in vitro (Imai et al., 1969aJ).

5. Conclusion
The structural elucidation of R. molischianum cytochrome c' has shown a tertiary fold and subunit organization that are unique among c-type cytochromes. Nevertheless, some local structural similarities are apparent in the pattern of covalent heme attachment in the mitochondrial cytochromes c and cytochrome c', which suggest a common enzymatic mechanism for heme incorporation in these otherwise quite different molecules. Differences in both the apparent spin state and ligand binding properties of cytochrome c' and other high-spin heme proteins appear to reflect fundamental differences in their heme environments. Structural features of the cytochrome c' heme environment are consistent with the existence of a quantum mechanical admixture of intermediate and high-spin iron electronic states. Further crystallographic studies of the molecule at higher resolution (15 A), and its reduced and liganded states, are aimed at elucidating the detailed structural factors that give rise to these different properties.
