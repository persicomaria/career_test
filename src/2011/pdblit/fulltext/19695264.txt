Abstract--A combination of a literature survey, structure-based virtual screening and synthesis of a small library was performed to identify hits to the potential antimycobacterial drug target, glutamine synthetase. The best inhibitor identified from the literature survey was (2S,5R)-2,6-diamino-5-hydroxyhexanoic acid (4, IC50 of 610 ± 15 lM). In the virtual screening 46,400 compounds were docked and subjected to a pharmacophore search. Of these compounds, 29 were purchased and tested in a biological assay, allowing three novel inhibitors containing an aromatic scaffold to be identified. Based on one of the hits from the virtual screening a small library of 15 analogues was synthesized producing four compounds that inhibited glutamine synthetase. Ó 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most serious infectious diseases. In 2005 the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 1.6 million deaths were caused by TB worldwide (www.who.int). Although the recommended Directly Observed Treatment Short-course therapy (DOTS) provides a cure for TB in many cases, there is a great need for new more effective TB drugs to combat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and to shorten the lengthy treatment time.1,2 Special effort is needed to find and develop lead compounds acting against already validated TB drug targets.2 Glutamine synthetase (GS, EC 6.3.1.2) catalyzes the synthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia

with concurrent hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The reaction passes through a phosphorylated tetrahedral intermediate.3 GS is important in bacterial nitrogen metabolism and the synthesized L -glutamine is also a major component of the cell wall of pathogenic mycobacteria.4 The potential of Mycobacterium tuberculosis GS as a drug target was established in a transposon mutagenesis study of strain H37Rv, classifying MtGS as essential for optimal growth.5 Furthermore, it has been shown that an antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide directed at the glnA1 gene, encoding MtGS, reduced bacterial replication and the amount of poly-L -glutamate/glutamine in the cell wall.6 Finally, glnA1 has been found to be essential for M. tuberculosis virulence.7 The two most active known GS inhibitors described in the literature, L -methionine-(S)sulfoximine (MSO, 1, Chart 1) and phosphinothricin (PPT, 2, Chart 1), have a profound effect on the growth of M. tuberculosis.8 These are also the only known inhibitors of MtGS. MSO inhibits growth of M. tuberculosis in culture and within human mononuclear phagocytes8 and the L -(SR)-diastereomer has also been demonstrated to have in vivo activity in a guinea pig model.9

Chart 1.

Amino acid analogues of MSO, PPT and mimics of the phosphorylated intermediate have been synthesized and evaluated on GS from different species in a number of studies.10­29 Much effort has been invested in developing GS inhibitors not only for antibacterial research, but also for weed control,20,25,30­32 since GS is a key enzyme in ammonia assimilation in plants. However, no inhibitor has shown improved activity compared to MSO or PPT. One of the most active PPT analogues (3, Chart 1) had a Ki in the same range as PPT when tested against GS isolated from Escherichia coli, spinach leaves and tobacco cultured cells.19,20 Other unnatural a-amino acids have also been shown to exert inhibitory effects on GS.31,33­36 Two such examples are (2S,5R)-2,6-diamino-5-hydroxyhexanoic acid (4, Chart 1, Ki 40 lM for Salmonella typhimurium GS,29 and also inhibiting sheep brain and soybean GS35) and L -2-amino-4-hydroxyaminobutyric acid (5, Chart 1, Ki 7 lM and 21 lM for sheep brain and soybean GS,35 respectively). Additionally, a set of aminomethylene-bisphosphonic acid derivatives inhibit rice GS.32 It should be noted that prokaryotic GSs are distantly related to eukaryotic ones, and that inhibition patterns may not be directly comparable. Hit identification, that is the process of finding smallmolecule inhibitors of a target protein, is a key step in drug discovery. Hit identification strategies37,38 include literature surveys, identification of endogenous ligands or active natural products, high-throughput screening, virtual screening, chemogenomics, ligand design and combinatorial chemistry. This study aims to find new hits against the antimycobacterial drug target MtGS utilizing three of the above mentioned hit identification strategies. This work is focused on the amino acid site, where all of the presently known inhibitors bind. First the literature was surveyed to identify small molecules known to be active on GS in other species that could be purchased or easily synthesized. In parallel, a structure-based virtual screening of the amino acid binding site was performed to uncover possible novel hits. Based on the virtual screening results, a small library of analogues was synthesized. Herein, we present the results of our efforts. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Biological assay A GS assay was developed based on the biosynthetic reaction, considered to be the most biologically relevant.29 The sensitivity of the present assay for inhibitors

binding to the amino acid site was optimized by using relatively high concentrations of ATP and magnesium ions, and choosing a glutamate concentration similar to the Km for that substrate. DMSO, used for dissolving some inhibitors, was found to have an activating effect on MtGS. Approximately 10% activation was observed at a DMSO concentration of 2% (v/v). However, the increase in activity could be corrected for by including DMSO in the compound-free reaction as well as in the background reaction. That the correction for the effect of DMSO did not interfere with the inhibition analysis was demonstrated by tests with compound 4, which was dissolved in both MilliQ water and DMSO, and found to have a percentage of inhibition of 58 ± 16% and 56 ± 10%, respectively. 2.2. Literature survey Since the residues in the amino acid binding site are highly conserved,29 we anticipated that known inhibitors of GS from other species, including distantly related GS types, could also be active on MtGS. In fact a number of inhibitors, including MSO,8 or its diastereomeric mixture 8,11,13,23 L -(SR), PPT,8,19,20,22­25,28 3,19,20 and 429,35 have shown inhibitory activity when tested on both bacterial and eukaryotic GSs. Therefore a literature search was performed to identify known GS inhibitors for both eukaryotic and prokaryotic enzymes. The majority of the inhibitors reported previously were amino acid based and had activities ranging from lM to mM. Compounds that we could identify as commercially available (1­2, 4 and 6­8, Table 1) were purchased. Furthermore, the diastereomer of 4 (compound 11) was synthesized. Another compound (5) described in the literature, which inhibits both sheep brain GS and soybean GS with similar potency to that of MSO,35 was also synthesized, as well as the analogue having a methyl group in the same position as MSO and PPT (12). Finally, three analogues (9, 10 and 13) close to these were purchased. The compounds above were screened for inhibitory activity against MtGS at a single concentration (in general 1.0 mM) using a biosynthetic assay. Inhibition of MtGS was determined by comparison to that of uninhibited enzyme. The stereochemistry of the tested compounds was mostly the pure L -form (1, 5­7, 9­10 and 12­13). PPT (2) was tested as a racemic mixture and 8 was tested as L -(SR)-sulfoxide. Compounds 4 and 11 were synthesized with defined stereochemistry at both stereocenters as described in the experimental section. Furthermore, the compounds were docked to the active site of GS in an attempt to rationalize the structure­ activity relationship. The most active inhibitor of S. typhimurium GS,29 compound (4), was also found to inhibit MtGS. According to the proposed binding mode from the docking calculation, 4 retains all the important interactions to Arg329, His276, Gly272 and Glu135 in the amino acid backbone that are found in the complex structure of MSO with MtGS (Fig. 1). The 5-aminomethyl group approaches the proposed ammonium ion binding site39 (residues Glu219, Tyr186, Asp54 0 and Ser57 0 , Fig. 1). Combined,

Compounds 1 (MSO) and 2 (PPT) are known MtGS inhibitors, while 4­8 are known inhibitors of GSs of other species. Compounds 9­13 are analogues of previously known inhibitors. Results for MtGS are reported as percent inhibition in the biosynthetic assay in the presence of 1 mM compound. Literature values for GSs from other species were based on the transferase assay and are reported either as percent inhibition (where the concentration of compound is given in parentheses), or where available, as Ki. In the transferase assay, glutamine and hydroxylamine are converted into c-glutamyl hydroxamate and ammonia, in the presence of ADP, manganese and arsenate. a Reported values for MtGS are an average from three independent experiments, reported together with the standard deviation. NI indicates no inhibition. Substrate concentrations in the assay were 1 mM ATP, 10 mM L -glutamate and 30 mM ammonium chloride. b Dissolved in H2O. c Tested as a racemic mixture or a mixture of two diastereomers. d Dissolved in DMSO.

these interactions could explain the relatively good inhibition. The stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group of 4 is required to be R, since the S-isomer (11) was inactive. We therefore suggest that the interaction of the hydroxyl group with Arg368 is important, since the inactive compound (11) lacks this hydrogen bond (Fig. 1). An alternative explanation to the inactivity of 11 could be that this position must be occupied by an oxygen atom.

The importance of the stereochemistry at the same position in the active site has also previously been reported for the sulfoximine group, with the L -(S)-enantiomer of MSO being a more potent inhibitor of sheep brain GS40 and E. coli GS.41 Because of the strong inhibitory activity of 5 with regard to GS from other species (vide supra) we resynthesized

this compound and evaluated its inhibitory potency against MtGS. Unfortunately, compound 5 was only weakly potent. The analogue having a terminal methyl group corresponding to the methyl group in the sulfoximine and phosphinyl moiety of MSO and PPT, respectively, was also synthesized (12). However, this compound lacked inhibitory activity. Exchanging the hydroxylamine nitrogen of 5 with a carbon generates the inactive compound 9. Thus an oxygen atom at the 5-position of an amino acid is not the only characteristic of an active compound, although this has been identified as a common structural feature in many known inhibitors.35 L -Homoserine (10), with a carbon chain that is one methylene unit shorter than 9, was also tested and found to be inactive. Compound 6 has previously been reported to inhibit E. coli GS (Kis 54 lM)17 but was found to be inactive against MtGS. This finding was verified using a slightly different biosynthetic assay (for experimental details, see Lagerlund et al.42) where the activity of 6 was evaluated on GS from both species. Compound 6 was fairly potent on E. coli GS (61% inhibition at 1.1 mM), but lacked inhibitory potency on MtGS. Thus, despite the conserved residues in the amino acid binding site, there are differences in the catalytic properties of E. coli GS and MtGS that are reflected in the different inhibition pattern seen for this compound. The sulfonic acid (13) did not show any inhibition. However, the corresponding sulfone (7) inhibited MtGS, with 33% inhibition at a concentration of 1.0 mM. The same pattern was observed when comparing results with PPT and 6. Additionally, the (SR)-sulfoxide (8) did not show any inhibition. Thus, the structural features including a methyl group together with two anchor points (imine

Data points were normalized to ease comparison, using the experimentally determined Hi and Lo values, such that normalized fractional activity = (Y À Lo)/ (Hi À Lo). The accompanying curves are those calculated from Eq. 1 using the determined IC50 values (1, 51 lM, n = 3; 2, 1.9 lM, n = 3; 4, 610 lM, n = 5) together with Hi = 1 and Lo = 0. Substrate concentrations used in the assay were 1 mM ATP, 10 mM L -glutamate and 30 mM ammonium chloride.

nitrogen and/or double bonded oxygen(s)) seem to be very important for inhibition of the MtGS enzyme. The IC50 values were determined for the most potent compound (4) and for the two previously known inhibitors (1 and 2). MSO and PPT were the best inhibitors, with IC50 values of 51 ± 6 lM and 1.9 ± 0.4 lM, respectively (Fig. 2). Inhibitor 4 had an IC50 value of 610 ± 15 lM, which is 12 times higher than that of MSO. In total the literature survey identified three new inhibitors of MtGS among the tested compounds. 2.3. Virtual screening Starting from a database of 2.1 million commercially available compounds, the database was reduced to 46,400 compounds with a molecular weight <300 g/ mol containing carboxylic acid bioisosters43 (substrate), amides (product) or functional groups that have previously been used as substitutes for the sulfoximine group of MSO29 (Fig. 3). A docking protocol with FlexX was used that successfully reproduced the binding of phosphorylated MSO (MSO-P) observed in the crystallographic structure of MtGS44 as the top scoring pose. When non-phosphorylated MSO was docked, the top scoring pose overlaid well with the equivalent portions of MSO-P. PPT was also used to evaluate the docking protocol. Its top scoring pose was generally in agreement with the complex structure of S. typhimurium with PPT,45 with the only difference being that the methyl group is rotated by $180°. This is in accordance with the binding mode of PPT suggested by Krajewski et al. on the basis of high-resolution data.44 The 46,400

compounds were then subjected to ligand pre-treatment and docked in the amino acid binding site. The top scoring poses were filtered using a rigid pharmacophore search (Fig. 3), which yielded 3511 compounds that were visually inspected. Among these, 29 compounds were selected, purchased and screened for activity against MtGS using the biosynthetic assay at a single concentration, in general 1.0 mM, The most interesting of these are presented in Table 2. The virtual screening approach identified three active hits 14, 15 and 23 with 24%, 26% and 48% inhibition, respectively (Table 2). Interestingly these are not related to any previously known inhibitors of GS. The FlexX docking results suggested that compound 14 fits in the amino acid binding site (Fig. 4A) with the urea functionality facing Arg329 and Gly272. It places the tetrahedral sulfonamide group at the position of the sulfoximine of MSO-P, fulfilling one criterion possibly important for an active compound (vide supra). The sulfonamide functionality has also been used in an amino acid analogue that inhibited E. coli GS.17 Both compounds 15 (Fig. 4B) and 23 (Fig. 4C) interact with the carboxyl group in the same manner as MSO, forming an ionic interaction and hydrogen bonds to Arg329 and His276. Compound 23 lacks the backbone amino group, how-

ever, the secondary aromatic amino group instead forms hydrogen bonds to Glu135. Compound 15 extends somewhat further than MSO and can find additional interactions with its heterocyclic ring higher up in the amino acid binding site. All three compounds form a hydrogen bond between the key residue Arg368 (vide supra) and the double bonded oxygen of the sulfonamide, amide or sulfonic acid group, respectively.

Figure 4. Hits from the virtual screening. The three inhibitors identified in the virtual screening and the docked solution of these in the amino acid binding site. Compounds 14 (A) and 15 (B) and 23 (C) show key interactions with residues in the binding site.

Glutamate analogues with a longer carbon chain have been reported as substrates of sheep brain GS46,47 and substituted glutamate analogues have been successfully converted to active PPT analogues.23­27 However, none of the 2-amino-phosphono-carboxylic acids (16­ 18) identified in the virtual screening showed any inhibitory activity, despite the fact that the phosphono group of docked 2-amino-6-phosphonohexanoic acid (17) overlaps well with the phosphono group of MSO-P. This is in accordance with the results for DL -homophosphinothricin, which did not show any inhibition of sheep brain GS.23 Thus the patterns of inhibition observed here agree well between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic GSs. In addition to the 29 compounds that were selected, the ortho-substituted phenylalanine derivative 20 was identified as a promising compound, for which the amino acid backbone and the phosphono group overlaid well with the corresponding functional groups of MSO-P. However, it could not be purchased and was therefore synthesized based on the method of Dorville et al. (Scheme 1).48

It was also realized that compound (21) carrying the ortho-substituted aminomethyl group could be obtained using this route. Starting from 2-cyanobenzylbromide, benzyliodide 42 was prepared in four steps. Phosphorylation of 42 with triethylphosphite gave the diethyl protected phosphate 43, which was treated with 9 M HCl to afford the desired compound 20. In addition, the corresponding methyl ester 22 was also isolated. It is believed to have been formed via a transesterification with MeOH in the first step of the synthesis of 20. Compound 20 was also inactive even though it can adopt a conformation that overlaps well with MSO-P. Considering the results with 20 and the 2-amino-phosphono-carboxylic acids (16­ 18), the tetrahedral sulfoximine group or a similar moiety four bonds distant from the carbonyl carbon seems to be important for inhibitory activity. The ortho-substituted aminomethyl compound (21), the methyl ester (22 ), obtained from the synthesis of 20, and the purchased para-substituted analogue (19) did not inhibit MtGS. 2.4. Synthesis of a small library Compound 23, identified in the virtual screening, also served as the starting point for a small synthetic library (Table 3). Several functional groups, including a carboxylic acid, a thioether, a sulfoxide, a sulfonamide and a phosphonate ester, were investigated as R2 substituents. The compounds were synthesized from glycine (24­ 28) or from L -(29­ 33) or D -serine (34­ 38), as described in the experimental section. The desired products were prepared via a CuI catalyzed N-arylation of glycine, D - and L -serine, using K2CO3 as a base, with an appropriately substituted arylbromide (Scheme 2).49 After work-up the products were purified by preparative HPLC. Chiral HPLC analysis was used to determine the chiral purity (>95%) of the products. The compounds were screened for activity against MtGS at a single concentration, in general 1.0 mM, using the biosynthetic assay. Four weak inhibitors were identified, with 28, a phosphonate ester being the most potent. The majority of the compounds displayed an apparent activation of the enzyme. Additional studies will be required to establish the structural basis for such activation, an effect that has been reported previously in the literature for

were particularly potent against MtGS, suggesting that the amino acid binding site may not be the best focus for future efforts. Recent structural information50 indicates that the less-conserved nucleotide-binding site could instead be explored as a means of attaining the desired specificity for the mycobacterial as compared to the mammalian enzyme.

plant GSs.30 However, to the best of our knowledge, activation of a bacterial GS has not been described. 3. Conclusions By using a literature survey, virtual screening and synthesis of analogues, ten new compounds inhibiting MtGS have been identified. Hits were identified by all three approaches. The best compound identified (4) had an IC50 of 610 ± 15 lM, and has previously been reported as an inhibitor of S. typhimurium GS,29 and to a lesser extent, sheep brain and soybean GS.35 Three novel inhibitors with aromatic scaffolds were found among the virtual screening compounds. These compounds (14, 15 and 23) showed 24­48% inhibition at 1.0 mM, respectively. Among the synthesized N-arylated amino acids, one inhibitor (28) was identified with 42% inhibition at 1.0 mM. However, we note that none of the inhibitors

Column chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 (particle size 0.040­0.063 mm, E. Merck). For reversed phase flash chromatography, silica gel RP-18 (0.040­0.063 mm, E. Merck) was used. Thin-layer chromatography was performed with aluminium sheets coated with silica gel 60 F254 (0.2 mm E. Merck), using UV-light or iodine vapour for visualization. Optical rotations were obtained at room temperature on a polarimeter; specific rotations ([a] D) are reported in deg/dm and the concentration (c) is given in g/100 mL in the specified solvent. THF was freshly distilled over ° Na/benzophenone. Acetone was dried over 3 A molecular sieves. All products were >95% pure according to either GC­MS or LC-MS (TIC). All other reactants and reagents were commercially available and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. L -Methionine-( S)-sulfoximine (1) and (2S,5R)-2,6-diamino-5-hydroxyhexanoic acid (4) were purchased from Fluka. DL -Phosphinothricin (2) was purchased from Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, The Netherlands. L -Methionine sulfone (7), L -methionine( SR)-sulfoxide (8), L -2-amino-4-sulfobutyric acid (13) and (23) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO USA. L -Homoserine (10) was purchased from Novabiochem, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. Compounds (6, 16 ­19) were purchased from InterBio Screen.51 Compounds 6, 16 ­18 were purchased as L -amino acids and 19 was supplied as a racemic mixture. Compound 14 was purchased from Asinex.52 Compound 15 was purchased from Chemdiv.53 The structure of the purchased virtual screening compounds was confirmed by 1H NMR and HPLC-MS. L -2-Amino-4-hydroxyaminobutyric acid (5),35 L -5-hydroxynorvaline (9)54 (2S,5S)-2,6-diamino-5-hydroxyhexanoic acid (11),55 L -2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylamino)butyric acid (12)34 and 2-amino-3-(2-phosphonomethylphenyl)propanoic acid (20)48 are known compounds. Compound 24 is a known structure, where additional data are given. Compounds 21, 22 and 25­ 38 are new compounds. Narylated amino acids gradually decomposed at room temperature, prohibiting accurate elemental analysis. Stocks of ATP (100 mM) were prepared, neutralized by sodium hydroxide and stored at À20 °C. Phosphate detection reagents (PiColorlock Gold) were purchased from Innova Bioscience (Cambridge, UK. url: http:// www.innovabiosciences.com). Sodium L -glutamate was purchased from Sigma­Aldrich, St. Louis, MO USA. A stock solution was prepared using MilliQ water (Millipore) and the pH was adjusted to 7.5; aliquots were stored at À20 °C. 4.2. Biological testing 4.2.1. GS samples. MtGS was heterologously expressed in a GlnE-deficient E. coli strain (a generous gift of AstraZeneca India, Limited), which yields a completely

unadenylylated enzyme. The protein was purified and stored as previously described.44 4.2.2. Assay development. Quantification of released phosphate in the assay was performed using a commercial inorganic phosphate detection reagent that produces a green colour with an absorption maximum at 635 nm. The reaction (100 lL) was stopped by addition of PiLock Gold reagent (25 lL, PiLock reagent mixed 1:100 with accelerator reagent). After 5 min incubation at room temperature, stabilizer (10 lL) was added to the solution, and an additional 30 min incubation at room temperature was performed before measuring the absorbance at 635 nm using a microtitre plate reader. A linear response was observed from 1.6 lM to 50 lM, in agreement with the manufacturer's specifications. The highest Pi concentration tested, 100 lM, deviated from linearity, due to the precipitation of the developed coloured compound. For enzyme assays, GS was diluted to 3.6 ng/lL (approximate subunit concentration of 70 nM) into HEPES­HCl (100 mM), pH 7.5, MgCl2 (50 mM) and equilibrated at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. The assay was subsequently performed in HEPES­HCl (50 mM), pH 7.5, MgCl2 (25 mM), ATP (1 mM), NH4Cl (30 mM) and monosodium L -glutamate (10 mM). The reaction was initiated by the addition of glutamate (50 lL), resulting in a final volume of 100 lL and an enzyme subunit concentration of 7 nM. The assay was performed in a 96-well microtitre plate format and incubated at room temperature. A linear increase in the amount of phosphate detected was observed for 2 hours. Running the assay reaction for a longer time would be expected to generate phosphate concentrations outside the linear range of the detection system. Therefore, under standard conditions during the inhibition study the assay was run for 60 min. To assess the quality of the results, Z 0 was calculated as described previously by Zhang et al.56 A Z 0 -factor greater than 0.5 is regarded as an excellent outcome; Z 0 -factors of 0.73 ± 0.15 (H2O) and 0.69 ± 0.19 (2.3% (v/v) DMSO) were obtained here. 4.2.3. Initial inhibition studies. Compounds were dissolved in MilliQ water or in DMSO to prepare a stock solution (50 mM) that was stored frozen at À20 °C. The compound (2 ll) was added to a microtitre plate and mixed with enzyme solution (50 ll) containing all components except L -glutamate. The enzyme­compound­substrate mixture was then preincubated for 20 min at room temperature prior to addition of L -glutamate to start the reaction (50 ll, 20 mM). The final compound concentration after addition of glutamate was 1 mM. For reactions with compounds dissolved in DMSO the final concentration of solvent was 2% (v/v). Each compound was assayed in triplicate and the results reported as means together with a standard deviation. The activity is presented as the percentage of inhibition. The Student's 2-sided T-test was used to determine if the observed activity was significantly different from the

uninhibited reaction. The p-value (p < 0.1) was used as the threshold for scoring a compound as active. To correct for an increased signal due to contaminating phosphate in the compound sample, and for possible intrinsic absorbance of the compound itself, a control plate was used.57 Each compound (2 lL) was treated as in the inhibition experiment except that GS and ATP were excluded from the reaction. The signal resulting from the phosphate contamination was subtracted from that obtained in the inhibitory assay (ODcorr=ODassay À ODCBG, where ODassay is defined as the optical density reading of the inhibition assay, and ODCBG as the optical density reading of the compound background). 4.2.4. IC50 determination. To determine the IC50 values, initial stock solutions of compound were prepared in MilliQ water and serially diluted to an appropriate concentration range. The final compound concentrations ranged from 1.2 mM with a 2-fold serial dilution to a concentration of 4.7 lM (MSO 1), 1 mM to 1.5 lM (PPT 2, 3-fold serial dilution) and 10 mM to 39 lM (4, 2-fold serial dilution). The assay was performed as previously described for the inhibition assay. Only compounds that led to more than 50% inhibition at 1 mM were evaluated. Three or more independent experiments were carried out for each compound. IC50 values were separately determined from each dilution series by nonlinear regression, fitting a three-parameter equation (Eq. 1) to the data from the microtitre plate readings at 635 nm, that is Y ¼ Lo þ Hi À Lo X 1 þ IC50 ð1Þ

Stereoisomers, tautomers and two ring conformations were automatically generated and the ligands were ionized and minimized with the force field OPLS2003. The UNITY search yielded 46,400 compounds, which was expanded to 102,379 structures to be used in the docking calculations. Babel71 was used for file conversion between sdf and mol2 format. The protein44 (PDB code 2BVC) was prepared with the protein preparation and refinement feature implemented in Maestro. ADP and MSO-P were removed, as well as all water molecules. FlexX72,73 was used as a docking tool with default settings. The active site was defined by the residues Glu133, Glu135, Tyr186, Glu219, Glu227, Asn271, Gly272, His276, Arg329, Glu335, Arg347, Arg352, Glu366, Arg368, and Tyr406 from one subunit, as well as Asp54 and Ser57 from a neighbouring molecule, and the three Mg2+ ions. Only the highest ranked pose in the docking was retained and subjected to a rigid pharmacophore search (Fig. 3) in UNITY. The pharmacophore model that was built based on MSO consisted of two hydrogen bond acceptors and one hydrogen ° bond donor, with a tolerance criterion of 2 A. A partial match constraint to fit at least two out of three pharmacophore points was employed. The remaining 3511 compounds that fulfilled the pharmacophore criterion were visually inspected and 29 compounds were selected for purchase, based on how well they fulfilled the following criteria: (a) a realistic conformation in the active site, (b) a tetrahedral atom in close proximity to the sulfur atom of MSO, (c) a negatively charged functional group in place of the phosphate from MSO-P and (d) an overall similarity to an amino acid. Compounds with large hydrophobic substituents were not selected. 4.4. Chemistry 4.4.1. Diethyl (2-cyanobenzyl)acetamidomalonate (39) . 48 To a 21% solution of NaOEt in EtOH (10.5 mL, 28.1 mmol), diethyl acetamidomalonate (5.00 g, 23 mmol) and 2-cyanobenzylbromide (5.01 g, 25.5 mmol) were added successively. The reaction was stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 36 h. The precipitate was dissolved in MeOH, and dichloromethane (DCM) and Celite were added before the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Flash chromatography of the crude product with DCM­acetone (19:1) gave 39 as a white solid (4.7 g, 62% yield) with ethyl methyl (2-cyanobenzyl)acetamidomalonate, approximately 12:1 as determined from 1 H NMR, resulting from transesterification, as a sideproduct. Experimental data were in accordance with literature data.48 4.4.2. Diethyl [2-(aminomethyl)benzyl]acetamidomalonate (40).48 To a suspension of 10% Pd on charcoal (1.22 g) in EtOH (1.2 mL) was added a solution of 39 (3.7 g, 11 mmol) in CHCl3 (45 mL), EtOH (23 mL) and concentrated HCl (3.5 mL). The reaction was stirred under H2 at 1 atm, 40 °C for 24 h. After filtration and evaporation, the residue was taken up in water (20 mL) and extracted with DCM (2 · 20 mL). From the organic phase unreacted 39 was recovered after evaporation.

where Hi is the estimated highest absorbance at zero inhibitor concentration, Lo the estimated lowest absorbance at infinite inhibitor concentration, X the concentration of inhibitor and Y the measured absorbance. Regression analysis was performed using the SOLVER function in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet software58­60 with the goal of maximizing the square of the correlation coefficient (R 2), and including the constraint that IC50 P 0. The reported IC50 values are an average of those obtained from three (1 and 2) or five (4) separate experiments together with the standard deviation. 4.3. Virtual screening A database containing approximately 2.1 million compounds was assembled.51­53,61­68 A 2D UNITY substructure search69 was performed to identify compounds containing carboxylic acid bioisosters43 (substrate analogues), primary amides (product analogues) or functional groups that have previously been used to substitute for the sulfoximine group of the MtGS inhibitor MSO29 (Fig. 3). The search was limited to compounds with a molecular weight less than 300 g/mol, due to the small size of the amino acid binding pocket. The ligprep module implemented in Maestro70 was used for ligand pre-treatment steps. Salts were removed and hydrogens were added to all ligands.
