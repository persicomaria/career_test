Chaohong Sun, Marcelo J. Berardi and John H. Bushweller*
Department of Chemistry Dartmouth College, Hanover NH 03755, USA The determination of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure of fully reduced human glutaredoxin is described. A total of 1159 useful nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) upper distance constraints and 187 dihedral angle constraints were obtained as the input for the structure calculations for which the torsion angle dynamics program DYANA has been utilized followed by energy minimization in water with the AMBER force ®eld as implemented in the program OPAL. The resulting 20 conformers have an average root-mean-square deviation Ê value relative to the mean coordinates of 0.54 A for all the backbone Ê atoms N, Ca and CH , and of 1.01 A for all heavy atoms. Human glutaredoxin consists of a four-stranded mixed b-sheet composed of residues 15 to 19, 43 to 47, 72 to 75 and 78 to 81, and ®ve a-helices composed of residues 4 to 9, 24 to 34, 54 to 65, 83 to 91, and 94 to 100. Comparisons with the structures of Escherichia coli glutaredoxin-1, pig liver glutaredoxin and human thioredoxin were made. Electrostatic calculations on the human glutaredoxin structure and that of related proteins provide an understanding of the variation of pKa values for the nucleophilic cysteine in the active site observed among these proteins. In addition, the high-resolution NMR solution structure of human glutaredoxin has been used to model the binding site for glutathione and for ribonucleotide reductase B1 by molecular dynamics simulations.

Introduction
Glutaredoxins are a family of proteins involved in electron transfer reactions via the reversible oxidation of two active-site thiols to a disul®de bond. Glutaredoxins have now been identi®ed in numerous species including Escherichia coli, bacteriophage T4, vaccinia virus, yeast, rabbit, pig, and human (Ahn & Moss, 1992; Gan & Wells, 1987a; Gan et al.,

This important family of protein disul®de reductants has been shown to play numerous important roles in the cell. They are essential for the glutathione-dependent reduction of ribonucleotides by ribonucleotide reductase (Holmgren, 1976, 1979; Luthman et al., 1979; Luthman & Holmgren, 1982). They have also been shown to play a role in the reduction of sulfate (Russel et al., 1990; Tsang, 1981), arsenate (Gladysheva et al., 1994; Wells et al., 1990), and ascorbate (Ahn & Moss, 1992; Gravina & Mieyal, 1993). They preferentially reduce glutathione-containing mixed disul®des (Gravina & Mieyal, 1993; Jung & Thomsa, 1996) due to the glutathione binding site present on the protein (Bushweller et al., 1994) . This preference for GSH-containing mixed disul®des also means that these proteins will play a key role in the glutathionylation and deglutathionylation of proteins which is an important element of the cellular response to oxidative stress. Glutaredoxins have also been shown to accelerate the

Very recently, human glutaredoxin has been shown to regulate the activity of HIV-1 protease and to be packaged into HIV viral particles (Davis et al., 1997). Interestingly, vaccinia virus also packages its virally encoded glutaredoxin into its viral particles (Ahn & Moss, 1992), suggesting a possible functional role for glutaredoxins in viral pathogenesis. Glutaredoxins are part of a structural superfamily of proteins which also includes thioredoxin, DsbA, GSH-transferase, and GSH-peroxidase, all of which share a common fold. Glutaredoxins are functionally distinguished from the related disul®de reductants termed thioredoxins by their differential reactivity. Glutaredoxins are reduced by GSH (see Figure 1) but not by thioredoxin reductase, whereas thioredoxins are reduced by the corresponding thioredoxin reductase but not by GSH. As mentioned above, glutaredoxins preferentially catalyze GSH mixed disul®de oxidoreduction reactions whereas thioredoxin acts as a quite general protein disul®de reductant. In E. coli, both thioredoxin and glutaredoxin can function as an effective protein disul®de reductant for ribonucleotide reductase; however, mutants de®cient in Grx (Kren et al., 1988) and the tenfold lower Km value of Grx for ribonucleotide reductase (Holmgren, 1979) suggest that Grx may be the dominant in vivo reductant. Three-dimensional structures of a number of glutaredoxins have recently been determined including for the oxidized, reduced, and GSH mixed disul®de forms of E. coli glutaredoxin-1 (Sodano et al., 1991; Xia et al., 1992; Bushweller et al., 1994), for the oxidized and reduced forms of bacteriophage T4 glutaredoxins (Eklund et al., 1992; Ingelman et al., 1995), and for oxidized pig liver glutaredoxin (Katti et al., 1995). Glutaredoxins show a high degree of homology in the vicinity of the active site; however, the homology between E. coli glutaredoxin±1 in particular and the mammalian glutaredoxin breaks down outside these regions. Human glutaredoxin is longer than its E. coli counterpart and is a basic protein, unlike the E. coli enzyme, thus it is of signi®cant interest to structurally characterize human glutaredoxin. All the mammalian glutaredoxins studied thus far have two or more cysteine residues in addition to those observed in the active site. Human glutaredoxin possesses three additional cysteine residues (Cys8, Cys79 and Cys83). These

additional cysteine residues have been proposed to play a regulatory role because their oxidation leads to inactivation in the case of calf thymus glutaredoxin (Klintrot et al., 19984).The presence of this potential site for redox regulation provides an opportunity to examine the potential structural basis for such regulation in this system. Herein we report the high resolution NMR solution structure of the fully reduced form of human glutaredoxin as well as detailed analysis of the implications of the structure on the cysteine pKa values, binding of GSH, and binding of ribonucleotide reductase.

Results
Collection of conformational constraints and calculation of the three-dimensional structure A total of 3779 cross-peaks were assigned and integrated in the 60 ms 3D 15N and13C-edited NOESY spectra of human glutaredoxin. After preprocessing with DYANA to exclude redundant upper distance constraints and to include pseudoatom corrections, a total of 1159 meaningful NOE upper distance constraints were obtained (398 intraresidual, 250 sequential, 220 medium-range, and 283 long-range) corresponding to an average of 11 distance constraints per residue. The distribution of NOE upper distance constraints versus the sequence is shown in Figure 2 and ranges from a low of one constraint for Asn52 to a high of 41 constraints for Ile19. A total of 96 3JHNHa coupling constants for 91 residues (including ®ve Gly) and 91 3JHaHb coupling constants were measured. 3 JHNHa coupling constants were obtained from either inverse Fourier transformation of in-phase multiplets from a 2D [15N,1H] HSQC spectrum (Szyperski et al., 1992) or 3D HNHA (Kuboniwa et al., 1994) for Gly residues. 3JHaHb coupling constants were obtained for 55 residues from analysis of a 3D HACAHB-COSY spectrum (Grzesiek et al., 1995). Additionally, qualitative values of 3JNHb were obtained from a 3D HNHB spectrum (Archer et al., 1991). Analysis with the programs HABAS È È (Guntert et al., 1989) and GLOMSA (Guntert et al., 1991) yielded stereospeci®c assignments for 44 pairs of CH2 groups including ®ve of the Gly residues and for eight pairs of isopropyl methyl groups of Val and Leu. In addition, stereospeci®c assignments for 13 of the 15 side-chain amide proton pairs of Asn and Gln were obtained on the

689 very well-de®ned as indicated by the average of the pairwise RMSD values for the 20 ®nal conformers relative to their mean coordinates which is Ê Ê 0.54 A for the entire backbone and 0.41 A for the secondary structure elements (Table 2). The corresponding value for all heavy atoms relative to their Ê mean coordinates is 1.01 A (Table 2). An additional indication of the quality of the structure determination can be obtained from an analysis of the conformers with the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1996), which shows 87.6% of the residues to be located in the most-favored region of the Ramachandran plot, 10.7% in additionally allowed regions, 2.0% in generously allowed regions, and only 0.6% in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. As seen in Figure 3, human glutaredoxin is an a/b protein as are all the other glutaredoxins for which structural information is available (Sodano et al., 1991; Xia et al., 1992; Bushweller et al., 1994; Eklund et al., 1992; Ingelman et al., 1995; Katti et al., 1995). The molecular architecture of human glutaredoxin consists of a four-stranded mixed b-sheet very similar to that observed in E. coli glutaredoxin-1 (Sodano et al., 1991) composed of residues 15 to 19, 43 to 47, 72 to 75, and 78 to 81 and ®ve a-helices composed of residues 4 to 9, 24 to 34, 54 to 65, 83 to 91, and 94 to 100 in contrast to the three helices observed in E. coli glutaredoxin-1. The b-sheet forms the central core of the protein with helices 1 and 3 located on one side of the sheet and helices 2, 4, and 5 located on the other side. The structure is very similar to the determined X-ray crystallographic structure of oxidized pig liver glutaredoxin (Katti et al., 1995). As seen in Figure 5a, the structure is very wellde®ned with several localized regions of increased disorder including the N-terminal Ala2 and Gln3 residues, around the active site Thr22 whose amide NH was not observable, and around Thr51 and Asn52, located in the loop before helix 3. In all cases, a very low density of NOE upper distance constraints was obtained in these regions (Figure 2). Measurement of the 15N T2 values (Figure 5b) for the backbone of the protein shows the active site Cys23 to have the fourth highest value, suggesting increased mobility in this region of the protein which appears to be re¯ected in the structures. Residues 51 and 52 display depressed T2 values

basis of the intensities of intra-residual NOEs between the two amide protons and the b- or gCH2 groups. A total of 65 stereospeci®c assignments were obtained. The 20 conformers with the lowest residual target function values from DYANA were subjected to energy minimization in Ê a water shell of 6 A thickness. The 20 ®nal energyminimized conformers used to represent the solution structure of fully reduced human glutaredoxin have small residual violations of the NOE upper distance constraints and the dihedral angle constraints, as well as low overall energies (Table 1). The coordinates for the 20 conformers have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with entry number 1JHB.

The average coordinates were calculated after superposition of the 20 conformers for minimal RMSD of the backbone atoms of residues 2 to 106. a Secondary structure elements include the following residues: 4 to 9, 24 to 34, 54 to 65, 83 to 91, 94 to 100 for helices, and 15 to 19, 43 to 47, 72 to 75, 78 to 81 for b-strands.

role in the binding of E. coli glutaredoxin-1 to ribonucleotide reductase (Berardi et al., 1998). We were not able to obtain 15N T2 measurements for the Nterminal Ala2 and Gln3 residues due to the absence of these NH resonances from the spectra. In addition to the characteristic i to i  4 hydrogen bonds in the helices and the inter-strand hydrogen bonds observed between the residues of the b-sheet, a number of structurally important hydrogen bonds have been identi®ed. In the active site, the HN of Agr27 is hydrogen-bonded to the

CO of Cys23 to provide a turn that is important for the positioning of the active site cysteine residues as well as for initiation of a-helix 2. A hydrogen bond between the NH of Lys39 and the CO of Ala104 serves to hold a-helix 5 in contact with the extended loop between a-helix 2 and b-strand 2. In E. coli glutaredoxin-1, there is no a-helix 5 and the loop between a-helix 2 and b-strand 2 is much shorter, thus the extended nature of this loop is apparently necessary for interactions with a-helix 5. A consistent hydrogen bond is observed from the NH of Thr49 to the side-chain carboxylate of Asp47. As mentioned above, the loop containing Thr49 has been shown to be important in the binding of E. coli glutaredoxin-1 to ribonucleotide reductase (Berardi et al., 1998); thus, this hydrogen bond is likely to be important for the determination of the conformation of this loop. The sidechain NH2 of Gln58 shows a consistent hydrogen bond to the CO of Arg68 which is important for the placement of a-helix 3 on the core of protein. A hydrogen bond between the side-chain OH of Thr65 to the CO of Leu61 serves as a C-terminal helix cap that will help to stabilize the C-terminal end of a-helix 3. Both this hydrogen bond and the previous one are located in close proximity to the site of binding of glutathione (Bushweller et al., 1994) and of ribonucleotide reductase (Berardi et al., 1998) identi®ed in E. coli glutaredoxin-1, suggesting that their presence or absence could be in¯uenced by substrate binding and could provide a mechanism for conformational changes associated with binding. Helices 4 and 5 are bent at an angle of approximately 90 to one another. This break occurs at Gly93 where two hydrogen bonds help to stabilize this kink: HN of Leu95 to CO of Leu89 and HN of Leu96 to CO of Gly93.

Averaged coordinates of 20 NMR conformers were used for human glutaredoxin and reduced E. coli glutaredoxin-1 (Sodano et al., 1991; Protein Data Bank entry 1EGR) in this Table, which are indicated as human Grx hRedi and E. coli Grx-1 hRedi. X-ray structures of pig liver glutaredoxin (Katti et al., 1995; Protein Data Bank entry 1KTE) and reduced human thioredoxin (Weichsel et al., 1996; Protein Data Bank entry 1ERT) are represented as Pig Grx Ox and hu Trx Red, respectively. Thirty-three residues were used to align the structures and calculate the displacements for the backbone atoms N, Ca, and CH in this Table, which are residues 15 to 19, 23 to 35, 43 to 47, 72 to 75, and 78 to 83 for human glutaredoxin; residues 14 to 18, 22 to 34, 42 to 46, 71 to 74, and 77 to 82 for pig liver glutaredoxin; residues 3 to 7, 11 to 23, 33 to 37, 61 to 64, and 67 to 72 for E. coli glutaredoxin-1; and residues 24 to 28, 32 to 44, 55 to 59, 76 to 79, and 87 to 92 for human thioredoxin.

agreement of the structures for this portion of the protein. The human glutaredoxin contains two additional helices relative to its E. coli counterpart located at the N and C termini of the protein. The loop connecting a-helix 2 to b-strand 2 (a1 to b2 in E. coli) is substantially longer in the human protein. The helix containing the active site is one turn shorter in the human protein, perhaps also contributing to the increased length of the aforementioned loop. In addition, a-helix 3 in human glutaredoxin is one turn longer and positioned differently than its counterpart in E. coli glutaredoxin1. This results in a narrowing of the groove into which the ribonucleotide reductase substrate has been shown to bind in E. coli glutaredoxin-1 (Berardi et al., 1998). The narrowing of this groove is quite interesting in light of the fact that the corresponding region of the human ribonucleotide reductase, which presumably binds in the same region, contains residues which are much smaller in size than those in the E. coli ribonucleotide reductase. Comparison of the human glutaredoxin structure to the X-ray crystal structure of oxidized pig liver glutaredoxin (Katti et al., 1995) shows very good agreement with an RMSD of overall backbone Ê Ê atoms of 1.2 A and a value of 0.6 A for the residues indicated in Table 3. However, there are several notable differences. Figure 6 shows a plot of the backbone displacement between the mean structure of human glutaredoxin and the X-ray structure of pig liver glutaredoxin as well as the average B-factors of backbone N, Ca, and CH atoms from the X-ray structure of pig liver glutaredoxin (numbering used is based on human glutaredoxin, starting from Ala2). The loop following a-helix 2 shows a signi®cant displacement between the two proteins. As seen in Figure 6, only residue 35 (Glu34 in pig liver) shows an increased B-factor for this loop; thus, this appears to be a real difference between the two structures. Because this loop is in contact with a-helix 5, there is also a displacement in the position of a-helix 5 resulting from this difference. Examination of the crystal structure of

pig liver glutaredoxin shows Glu39 (Gln40 in human Grx) forming an intermolecular salt bridge with residue Arg97 (Arg98 in human Grx) in another protein molecule. This crystal packing interaction provides an explanation for the differences observed between the two structures in these regions. In addition, residues Asn52 to Thr54 (corresponding to Ser51 to Thr53 in pig liver glutaredoxin) in the loop following b-strand 2 also displays a signi®cant displacement between the two structures. As mentioned above, this is a region of the protein where the solution structure is not well de®ned due to a low density of constraints. As also mentioned above, the 15N T2 values for Thr51 and Asn52 display depressed values potentially indicative of conformational exchange in this region. Consistent with this, the pig liver structure shows increased B-factors for this region of the structure.

Comparison with the X-ray crystal structure of reduced human thioredoxin (Weichsel et al., 1996) shows good agreement between the two proteins for the four-stranded b-sheet (b2 to b5) and for helix 2 of human glutaredoxin which give an Ê RMSD of 1.6 A (Table 3). Human thioredoxin contains an additional b-strand at its N terminus that combines to form a ®ve-stranded b-sheet. In addition, a-helix 4 in human glutaredoxin is replaced by an extended secondary structure element in human thioredoxin. This is likely to be functionally important since corresponding residues in this helix have been implicated in the binding of glutathione (Bushweller et al., 1994) as well as ribonucleotide reductase (Berardi et al., 1998) to E. coli glutaredoxin-1. The removal of this helix creates a much less tortuous surface than that found in glutaredoxins which may help to explain the enhanced substrate speci®city glutaredoxins display relative to thioredoxins which are quite general protein disul®de reductases. Environment of the active site The pKa value of the active site thiol in glutaredoxins has been shown to have a dramatically È depressed value of ca. 4.5 (Bjornberg, 1990; Gan & Wells, 1987b; Mieyal et al., 1991), indicating that it will exist as a thiolate anion at physiological pH. In order to account for the presence of this thiolate, the OPAL energy minimizations have been carried out with Cys23 in the thiolate form. Comparison of energy minimizations with the thiol and thiolate forms of Cys23 showed that there is a substantive effect of this change in terms of the local structure in the active site region. Figure 7 shows a plot of the displacement between the mean coordinates of the conformers minimized with a thiol or thiolate at Cys23. There are clear differences in the two structures for backbone and side-chain nuclei in the vicinity of the active site and more modest changes for a number of side-chains located else-

where. The most dramatic side-chain movement occurs for Lys20, which is conserved as a positive charge in all the known glutaredoxins, suggesting an important role for this residue in glutaredoxins' function. In addition, the side-chains of Arg27, Arg68, and Arg98 move more modestly in response to the change in electrostatic ®eld associated with having a thiolate at this position. Changes in the backbone and side chain conformation in the vicinity of the active site also result in a different pattern of interactions observed in the vicinity of the active site (see Table 4). The stabilization of this negative charge on Cys23 has been proposed to arise from a variety of in¯uences including the dipole moment of the

In order to address this question, we have calculated the electrostatic potential on the surface of the protein using QUANTA97 (QUANTA, Molecular Simulations Inc.). Figure 8 shows the results of this calculation. The thiol of Cys23 is located in a region of substantial positive potential as has also been observed for E. coli glutaredoxin-1 (Berardi et al., 1998). In order to assess what speci®c interactions may be responsible for the stabilization, we have also examined the structures for interactions with the thiolate anion. Hydrogen bond interactions were identi®ed in nine or more of the conformers between the thiolate anion and the HN of Tyr25, the HN of Cys26, and the SH of Cys26 (Table 4).

The protein orientation corresponds to the left panel of Figure 2. Blue areas correspond to positively charged regions and red areas to negatively charged regions. QUANTA97 (QUANTA, Molecular Simulations Inc.) was used for the calculation. The binding orientation for the peptide corresponding to the C terminus of human ribonucleotide reductase obtained from the molecular dynamics is schematically represented by a grey rod using the Ca trace of the C-terminal nine residues of the peptide. For clarity, the disul®de linkage is shown; however, the electrostatic potential displayed is for the Cys23 thiolate anion form of the free protein.

the NH resonance of the corresponding cysteine observed upon going from the oxidized to the reduced form in E. coli Grx-1. The interaction with the SH of Cys26 is interesting in that it implies a sharing of this proton between the two thiols which has also been proposed for E. coli thioredoxin (Jeng et al., 1995). This would ®t with the results of mutagenesis data which show that replacement of the more C-terminal Cys in the active site with a Ser in pig liver glutaredoxin results in a protein which retains all of its GSH disul®de oxidoreductase activity whereas mutation of this residue to an Ala results in a loss of 91% of its activity (Yang & Wells, 1991). The distance between Cys23 Sg and Ê Cys26 Sg observed in human Grx is 4.1(Æ0.8) A, which is close to that seen in the NMR structure of Ê reduced E. coli Trx (3.82 A; Jeng et al., 1994) and in the X-ray structure of reduced wild-type human Ê Trx (3.9 A; Weichsel et al., 1996). In contrast, the corresponding distance in the NMR structure of a Ê mutant human Trx was observed to be 3.1 A (Qin et al., 1994). The side-chain ammonium group of Ê Lys20 was also observed within 3.0 A of the sulfur of Cys23 in four of the 20 conformers, suggesting that this residue may also contribute to the local positive electrostatic potential. The positive charge at this position is conserved across all known glutaredoxins. As the pKa value of the glutaredoxin nucleophilic thiol is substantially lower than that for thioredoxin, the additional interactions observed with the thiolate in human glutaredoxin may account for the signi®cantly lower pKa observed for Grx relative to Trx. In order to assess the generality of this local electrostatic potential determining the pKa value of the Cys residues in these proteins, we have calculated the electrostatic potential at the nucleophilic sulfur for E. coli glutaredoxin-1, E. coli thioredoxin, and E. coli DsbA for which the pKa values have been È determined (Bjornberg, 1990; Kallis & Holmgren, 1980; Nelson & Creighton, 1994). As shown in Table 5, there is a good correlation between the calculated potential and the observed pKa value, indicating that this is an effective predictor of the thiol pKa value. The somewhat poor agreement for E. coli DsbA may result from the use of the oxidized structure for the calculations. Clearly, the unusually low pKa values observed for the nucleophilic thiols of Grx and Trx arise not from a single interaction but from the sum of a number of interactions. Calculation of the local electrostatic potential takes all of these effects into account and is therefore a general tool for evaluating charge stabilization of thiolate anions or any other ionizable groups. As mentioned above, the active site nucleophilic thiol is located in a region of positive electrostatic potential on the protein. This has also recently been identi®ed as the binding site for both GSH (Bushweller et al., 1994) and ribonucleotide reductase (Berardi et al., 1998) on E. coli glutaredoxin-1. As seen in the case of E. coli, the C-terminal end of the B1 subunit of human ribonucleotide

The average electrostatic potentials at the sulfur atom on the Connolly surface of the nucleophilic Cys residues were calculated with QUANTA97 (QUANTA, Molecular Simulations Inc.) The X-ray structure of oxidized E. coli DsbA (Martin et al., 1993; Protein Data Bank entry 1DSB), the lowest energy conformer of the NMR solution structure of reduced E. coli thioredoxin (Jeng et al., 1994; Protein Data Bank entry 1XOB), and the lowest energy conformer of the NMR solution structure of reduced E. coli glutaredoxin-1 (Sodano et al., 1991; Protein Data Bank entry 1EGR) were used to calculate the electrostatic potential. The lowest energy conformer of the 20 energy-minimized human glutaredoxin conformers with Cys23 as protonated thiol (SH) was used for the calculation. a Oxidized X-ray crystal structure of E. coli DsbA has been used for this calculation. b The pKa values for human Grx, E. coli DsbA, E. coli Grx-1, and E. coli Trx were obtained from Mieyal È et al. (1991), Nelson & Creighton (1994), Bjornberg (1990) and Kallis & Holmgren (1980), respectively.

reductase possesses a negative overall charge which will be attracted to the positive potential located in the vicinity of the active site on human glutaredoxin. Also as seen in the case of E. coli glutaredoxin-1 (Berardi et al., 1998), the overall dipole moment of human glutaredoxin extends directly through the active site in such a manner that it will tend to guide negatively charged disul®de substrates such as the C terminus of ribonucleotide reductase B1 or glutathione containing mixed disul®des down into the active site, thereby enhancing the on-rate for the reaction. Role of the additional Cys residues All of the mammalian thioredoxins and glutaredoxins have been shown to contain additional Cys residues to those located in the active site. Mutagenesis of Cys78 and Cys82 in pig liver glutaredoxin (Cys79 and Cys83 in human Grx) did not perturb the ability of the protein to reduce smallmolecule GSH mixed disul®des or ascorbate to any signi®cant extent (Yang & Wells, 1991). Because these mutants have not been assayed for their effect on protein disul®de reduction, the exact role of the additional cysteine residues in mammalian glutaredoxin has not been established. However, their spatial location and local environment may provide hints as to possible functional importance. Cys8 is located in the N-terminal helix and is solvent-exposed. The presence of this Cys decreases the lifetime of human glutaredoxin samples considerably with substantial aggregation of the protein if it is not maintained in a fully reduced state. The corresponding Cys8 3 Ser mutation signi®cantly improves this behavior (Padilla et al., 1996). Formation of disul®de-linked aggregates of human Grx is interesting in light of the recent demonstration that human thioredoxin can form disul®de-linked dimers in vitro which inhibit the activity of the protein (Weichsel et al., 1996). Dimerization or oligomerization of human Grx with disul®de cross-linking may also have a role in the regulation of human glutaredoxin, since oxidation has been shown to inhibit the activity of

calf thymus glutaredoxin (Klintrot et al., 1984). Cys79 is located in b-strand 4 and is also solventexposed, perhaps also providing a site for oligomerization. Cys83 is located at the N-terminal end of a-helix 4 which has been shown to be an important site for binding of GSH to E. coli glutaredoxin1 (Bushweller et al., 1994). It is solvent-exposed and is located in a region of positive electrostatic potential (see Figure 8), suggesting it will have a depressed pKa value and will be likely to be active in redox reactions. The proximity of this residue to the active site, its location in the GSH binding site, and the local electrostatic potential strongly suggest a key role for this thiol in the regulation of the protein or in one or more of the known activities of the protein. Modeling of GSH and ribonucleotide reductase B1 binding sites on human glutaredoxin In order to model the binding of glutathione and the B1 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase to human glutaredoxin, we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations of mixed disul®des between human Grx and either glutathione or a 16 residue peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the B1 subunit of human ribonucleotide reductase. The choice of the length of peptide utilized and the cysteine to form the mixed disul®de with was based on a recent study utilizing E. coli Grx-1 and a peptide derived from the C terminus of the E. coli ribonucleotide reductase which showed the more C-terminal cysteine to be the site of nucleophilic attack by Grx-1 and approximately ten C-terminal residues to be in direct contact with the protein (Berardi et al., 1998). The initial starting conformation for the glutathione simulation placed the glutathione in the orientation observed in the NMR solution structure of the mixed disul®de between E. coli Grx-1(C14S) and glutathione (Bushweller et al., 1994). The initial orientation chosen for the peptide places the C-terminal end of the peptide in a similar location to the C-terminal Gly in the glutathione model and is based on the recent preparation and characterization of a mixed

disul®de between E. coli Grx-1(C14S) and a 25 residue peptide corresponding to the C terminus of E. coli ribonucleotide reductase B1 (Berardi et al., 1998). Figure 9 shows the interactions that have been identi®ed between glutathione and human glutaredoxin in a majority of the conformers analyzed from the molecular dynamics simulation. Both the location and the interactions predicted are very similar to those seen in the mixed disul®de between E. coli glutaredoxin-1 and glutathione (Bushweller et al., 1994). As seen in the E. coli system, the charged functionalities of the g-Glu residue are predicted to be located at the N-terminal end of a-helix 4 in human glutaredoxin with electrostatic interactions between the ammonium group and the conserved Asp at position 85 as well as between the carboxylate and the helix dipole of a-helix 4. Hydrogen bonds between the NH and OH of Ser84 and the carboxylate of g-Glu are also predicted as was observed in the E. coli system (Bushweller et al., 1994). The carboxylate of the Gly residue in glutathione is predicted to form an electrostatic interaction with Lys20, unlike the interaction observed in the E. coli system. Lys20 is conserved as a positive charge across all the glutaredoxins, suggesting functional importance for this interaction. In the E. coli system, this interaction involves Lys45 which is an Asp in the human protein. The MD simulation also predicts hydrogen bonds between the CO and NH of Val70 and the NH and CO of the cysteine in the glutathione, respectively. The Val70 NH to Cys CO hydrogen bond was also identi®ed in the E. coli system; however, the Val70 CO to Cys NH hydrogen bond was not observed in a majority of the conformers (Bushweller et al., 1994). The simulation of the human Grx-peptide mixed disul®de proved quite revealing in terms of func-

tional understanding of the interactions between the two. The peptide binds in a groove located on the surface of the protein in the vicinity of the active site (Figure 8). Figure 10 shows the predicted interactions between the protein and the peptide identi®ed in a majority of the ten representative conformers analyzed. A number of the interactions predicted in the complex with glutathione have parallels in this complex. The ammonium group of Lys20 is predicted to interact with the C-terminal carboxylate of Ser792. A hydrogen bond is predicted between the Val70 CO of human Grx and the Cys787 NH of the peptide. The MD results also predicted an electrostatic interaction between the conserved Asp85 in human Grx and Arg784 in the peptide. In addition, a hydrogen bond was predicted between the Cys83 NH of human Grx and the carboxylate of Glu786 in the peptide as well as an electrostatic interaction between Arg72 of the protein and the carboxylate of Glu786 in the peptide. An electrostatic interaction is also predicted between Arg28 of the protein and Asp785 of the peptide. Interestingly, the positive charge at Lys20 and at Arg28 is highly conserved among glutaredoxins, suggesting a functional importance for these interactions. Arg72 is conserved among the mammalian glutaredoxins but not in the E. coli protein, which may be one source of binding speci®city. Consistent with this, an alignment of the ribonucleotide reductase B1 sequences (Berardi et al., 1998) shows Glu786 to be a Gly in the E. coli sequence. The hydrogen bond involving Cys83 is interesting from a regulatory point of view in that it is clear that oxidation of this thiol would have a substantial effect on binding to ribonucleotide reductase, thus providing further credence to the notion of this as a site for redox regulation. This residue is replaced by a Tyr in E. coli glutaredoxin-

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation Uniformly 15N and 13C/15N-labeled human glutaredoxin samples (0.8 mM and 1.8 mM, respectively) were prepared as described (Sun et al., 1997). The proteins were exchanged into a buffer of 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% NaN3, 95% H2O/5% 2H2O or 100% 2H2O. NMR spectroscopy NMR measurements were carried out at 30 C on a Varian Unityplus 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with an actively shielded triple resonance probe (Nalorac Corporation) and pulsed ®eld gradients. Pulsed ®eld gradients were utilized for suppression of the water signal and undesired coherence pathways (Bax & È Pochapsky, 1992; Wider & Wuthrich, 1993). NMR data È were processed with the program PROSA (Guntert et al., 1992) and the resulting NMR data were visualized and analyzed using the program XEASY (Bartels et al., 1995). For collection of NOE upper distance constraints, 3D 13 C-edited (Muhandiram et al., 1993) and 15N-edited NOESY (Zhang et al., 1994) spectra were recorded with a 60 ms mixing time on the 1.8 mM 13C/15N-labeled sample in 95% H2O/2H2O. Two separate 13C-edited NOESY spectra were recorded with the 13C carrier positioned at 43 ppm for aliphatic carbon atoms and at 132.3 ppm for the aromatic carbon atoms. Values of the 3JHNHa vicinal coupling constants were derived from inverse Fourier transformation of in-phase multiples from a 2D [15N,1H]-COSY experiment (Szyperski et al., 1992) and a 3D HNHA experiment (Kuboniwa et al., 1994). Values of 3 JHaHb coupling constants were determined from a 3D

HACAHB-COSY experiment recorded in 2H2O solution as described (Grzesiek et al., 1995). In addition, vicinal 3 JNHb coupling constants were estimated from a 3D HNHB experiment (Archer et al., 1991). The number of complex points and acquisition times for these experiments was as follows: 15N-NOESY, 15N (F1), 32 complex points, 19.5 ms; 1H (F2), 128 complex points, 19.6 ms; 1H (F3), 512 complex points, 78.8 ms; 13C-NOESY, 13C (F1), 40 complex points, 9.9 ms; 1H (F2), 124 complex points, 19.0 ms; 1H (F3), 512 complex points, 78.8 ms; [15N,1H]COSY, 15N (F1), 192 complex points, 119 ms; 1H (F2), 1024 complex points, 157.5 ms; HNHA, 15N (F1), 28 points, 16.7 ms; 1H (F2), 64 complex points, 11.3 ms; 1H (F3), 512 complex points, 78.8 ms; HACAHB, 13C (F1), 64 complex points, 15.7 ms; 1H (F2), 64 complex points, 12.7 ms; 1H (F3), 512 points, 102.4 ms; HNHB, 15N (F1), 32 complex points, 19.2 ms; 1H (F2), 64 complex points, 9.8 ms; 1H (F3), 512 complex points, 78.8 ms. For measurement of 15N T2 values, the pulse sequence by Farrow et al. (1994) optimized for minimal saturation of water was employed. A recycle delay of 1.0 second was used between acquisitions to ensure suf®cient recovery of NH magnetization (Sklenar et al., 1987). 15N T2 values were determined from 12 spectra with values of the CPMG delay of 16.3, 32.6, 48.9, 65.2, 81.4, 97.7, 114.0, 130.3, 146.6, 162.9, 228.0 and 325.8 ms. In order to generate pure absorptive 2D line shapes, the N and P-type signals recorded for each t1 point were stored separately in order to carry out the necessary addition and subtraction of FID's and 90 phase correction as described (Kay et al., 1992). The necessary data manipulations were carried out using software written in-house. Analysis of the data to obtain the 15N T2 values was carried out as described (Kelley et al., 1997). Determination of the three-dimensional structure Structure calculations were carried out via torsion È angle dynamics using the program DANA (Guntert et al., 1997). The input for the DYANA calculations consisted

698
of upper distance limits derived from NOESY cross-peak È intensities using the program CALIBA (Guntert et al., 1991) and dihedral angle constraints from the program È HABAS (Guntert et al., 1989) derived from a backbone conformational search using the intra-residual and sequential NOEs together with the spin-spin coupling constants 3JHNHa and 3JHaHb. HABAS also provided stereospeci®c assignments for 16 b-methylene groups. Inclusion of the qualitative 3JNHb data from the HNHB experiment allowed stereospeci®c assignments to be obtained for an additional 13 b-methylene groups. Stereospeci®c assignment of the side-chain NH2 groups of Asn and Gln was based on the intensities of intraresidual NH2-gCH2 or bCH2 protons in the 60 ms NOESY data. No explicit hydrogen bond constraints have been utilized at any step in the calculations. Initial structures were calculated with DYANA from a preliminary data set. The resulting conformers with lowest target function were utilized to rede®ne the calibration È parameters in CALIBA (Guntert et al., 1991), to assign additional peaks in the NOESY spectra, and to obtain additional stereospeci®c assignments using the program È GLOMSA (Guntert et al., 1991). GLOMSA analysis provided stereospeci®c assignments for diastereotopic methyls of eight Val and Leu residues in the protein as well as for 15 additional diastereotopic groups. The cycle of calculations and additional assignments was repeated until the NOESY spectra were exhausted. The DYANA calculations were started with 50 random conformers. A total of 10,000 MD steps were employed with the ®rst 20% of the steps at high temperature (Thigh  8.0) followed by slow cooling during the remainder of the MD steps to a ®nal temperature Tend  0.0 followed by 1000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. Following the torsion angle dynamics calculations, the 20 conformers with the lowest target function values were subjected to energy minimization using the AMBER force ®eld (Cornell et al., 1995) implemented in È the program OPAL (Luginbuhl et al., 1996). In order to carry out the calculations with a thiolate for Cys23, a cysteine residue with a negatively charged sulfur was added into the corresponding AMBER library. Pseudoenergy terms were utilized for distance constraints and Ê dihedral angle constraints where violations of 0.1 A or 2.5 correspond to an energy of kT/2. The energy minimization was carried out with the protein surrounded Ê by a shell of water molecules of thickness 6 A and employing a uniform dielectric constant for the electrostatic interactions. A total of 1500 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization were utilized for each conformer. The resulting 20 energy minimized conformers were used to represent the solution structure of fully reduced human glutaredoxin.

NMR Solution Structure of Reduced Human Glutaredoxin

Electrostatic potential surfaces were calculated using the commercial software package QUANTA97 (QUANTA, Molecular Simulations Inc.). Atomic radii and charges were obtained from the CHARMm 23.2 parameter ®le with a dielectric constant of 4 at 300 K. The conformer with the lowest energy was used in the electrostatic potential calculations. The electrostatic potential Ê was mapped on a solid surface de®ned by a 1.4 A probe. The electrostatic distribution was represented with shades of blue for positively charged regions of potential energy from 0 to 50 kcal/mol, and shades of red for negatively charged regions with energies between 0 and À50 kcal/mol. The molecular dipole moment was calculated in QUANTA97 using the lowest energy structure. A value of 203 D was obtained for the magnitude of the dipole moment. Molecular dynamics simulations The lowest energy conformer of the 20 ®nal energyminimized conformers of human glutaredoxin was selected for use in subsequent studies. All calculations were performed with CHARMm 23.2 (Brooks et al., 1983; Karplus & Petsko, 1990). All energy terms were computed. A distance dependent dielectric model and Ê a non-bonded cutoff of 15.00 A was employed. For modeling of glutathione and ribonucleotide reductase binding to human Grx, glutathione and a 16 residue peptide corresponding to the C-terminal end of the B1 subunit of human ribonucleotide reductase were constructed using the Sequence Builder and Molecular Editor modules from the QUANTA97 program (QUANTA, Molecular Simulations Inc.). The glutathione and peptide segments were generated in elongated conformations and then energy-minimized for 50 and 200 cycles, respectively, using the Steepest Descents method and then for an additional 50 and 100 cycles, respectively, using the Adopted Basis Newton Rapson method. A mixed disul®de was constructed between Cys23 of human Grx and glutathione for modeling of the glutathione binding site. Similarly, a mixed disul®de between Cys23 of human Grx and Cys790 of the peptide was constructed. For modeling of the glutathione binding site, an initial orientation of the glutathione on human Grx was selected to correspond to that observed in the mixed disul®de between E. coli Grx-1 and glutathione (Bushweller et al., 1994). Other orientations of the glutathione on the protein were found to be much higher in energy and were not explored further. The mixed disul®de was energy-minimized for 100 cycles using the Steepest Descents method while holding the protein coordinates ®xed. Subsequently, the constraints on the protein coordinates were released and energy-minimization using the Adopted Basis Newton Rapson method was applied for 100 cycles. The mixed disul®de was heated to 350 K using 350 cycles of 0.001 ps per cycle for a total of 0.35 ps at 1 K/cycle. Equilibration was run for 2 ps with a temperature RMS deviation of 5 K in the last picosecond. The system was then subjected to 20 ps of molecular dynamics. Subsequently, three cycles consisting of 50 ps of molecular dynamics followed by 3 ps equilibration were then performed for a total of 150 ps of MD simulation. This was followed by four cycles of heating to 1000 K and annealing to 300 K in 10 ps followed by 5 ps equilibration at 300 K. Finally, two cycles consisting of 50 ps of molecular dynamics followed by 2 ps of equilibration were performed. Conformers were selected at

Structure comparisons and analysis The programs MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996), Midasplus (Ferrin et al., 1988) and QUANTA97 (QUANTA, Molecular Simulations Inc.) were utilized to visualize the structures. Superpositions and pairwise RMSD values for human Grx were calculated using the program XAM (Xia, 1992). The mean coordinates were calculated by superposition of 20 ®nal conformers to yield a minimal RMSD for the backbone atoms followed by averaging of the coordinates of the corresponding atoms in the superimposed conformers. The quality of the structures was evaluated with the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1996).

NMR Solution Structure of Reduced Human Glutaredoxin 0.5 ps intervals. Cluster analysis was performed on the resulting 200 conformers. Twenty clusters were obtained Ê with an RMSD threshold of 0.81 A. The lowest energy conformer of each cluster was selected and energy-minimized using 100 cycles of the conjugated gradient method. The 20 resulting conformers were used for the analysis of the glutathione mixed disul®de. For the peptide mixed disul®de model, one conformer was generated using the orientation of the peptide recently identi®ed in a mixed disul®de between E. coli Grx-1 and a peptide derived from E. coli ribonucleotide reductase B1 (Berardi et al., 1998). The mixed disul®de was energy-minimized for 300 steps using the Steepest Descents method with ®xed atomic coordinates for the protein. Subsequently, an additional 150 cycles of unconstrained energy-minimization was performed using the Adopted Basis Newton Rapson method. The minimized model was heated from 0 to 300 K over 600 cycles with 0.001 ps per cycle. Equilibration was run for 5 ps with a temperature RMS deviation of 3 K in the last picosecond. The system was then subjected to 20 ps of molecular dynamics. Five cycles consisting of 30 ps of molecular dynamics followed by 3 ps equilibrium at 300 K were then performed. In the last 100 ps, conformers were selected at 1 ps intervals. Cluster analysis yielded ten Ê clusters with an RMSD threshold of 0.74 A. The lowest energy conformer of each cluster was selected and minimized using 150 cycles of the conjugated gradient method yielding the ten energy-minimized conformers utilized for subsequent analysis.
