Biological context Although the nuclear inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP1) was originally discovered as a potent and specific inhibitor of protein Ser/Thr phosphatase-1 (PP1), NIPP1 is also involved in transcription and pre-mRNA splicing via mechanisms that are not related to PP1 activity (Beullens and Bollen 2002). NIPP1 acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding to the Polycomb protein, EED (embryonic ectoderm development) (Eynde et al. 2004), and appears to be required for the assembly of splicesomes, the protein-RNA complexes that catalyze pre-mRNA splicing. The spliceosomal function of NIPP1 requires both its C-terminal domain and its N-terminal Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. FHA domains are a class of ubiquitous signaling modules that appear to function through interactions with Ser/ Thr phosphorylated target proteins. Several high-resolution NMR structures of FHA domains have been reported (Durocher et al. 2000; Byeon et al. 2001; Li et al. 2002; Stavridi et al. 2002; Byeon et al. 2005) and their ligand specificities have been identified using short phosphopeptides comprised of 6­15 residues. The Rad53 FHA1 domain specifically recognizes the phosphothreonine (pThr)-containing peptides with Asp at the +3 position

(pTXXD), while the Rad53 FHA2 and Chk2 FHA domains bind the pThr-containing peptides that have either Leu or Ile at the +3 position (pTXXL/I) (Durocher et al. 2000; Liao et al. 2000; Byeon et al. 2001). The FHA domain of human Ki67, on the other hand, interacts with the human nucleolar protein hNIFK by recognizing a 44-residue fragment, hNIFK226­269, phosphorylated at Thr234. The recognition of the hNIFK peptide by the Ki67 FHA domain required the pThr site and was not consistent with the pTXXD/L/I rule. Thus, the complex structure with the polypeptide revealed another recognition mode of target polypeptides by the FHA domain (Byeon et al. 2005). The NIPP1 FHA domain interacts with essential splicing factors, CDC5L (Boudrez et al. 2000) and SAP155 (Boudrez et al. 2002), and a cell cycle-regulated kinase, MELK (Vulsteke et al. 2004). The NIPP1 FHA domain recognizes sequences containing pThr in the Thr-Pro dipeptide-rich region of the target proteins. Mutagenesis studies of SAP155 and MELK revealed that the phosphorylation site essential for binding to the NIPP1 FHA domain do not conform to the pTXXD/I/L motif, like Ki67 FHA. Here, we report the solution structure of the NIPP1 FHA domain and study the recognition mode of the target polypeptides derived from MELK by NIPP1 FHA.

Methods and results The GST-tagged NIPP1 FHA domain (1­132) was produced in BL21(DE3) cells transformed by the pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) plasmid. The coding region of the GST-tag sequence and PreScission protease cleavage site was added to the N-terminus. The protein was isotopically 13C- and 15N-labeled by growing E. coli in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl (1 g/l) and

C-glucose (2 g/l) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Cells were grown at 37°C in M9 medium. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-1thio-b-galctopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM at 16°C. The cells were cultured at 16°C and were lysed. The GST-fused NIPP1 FHA domain was purified using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare BioSciences), and GST was excised from the NIPP1 FHA domain with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare BioSciences). Then, the excised GST and PreScssion protease were removed from NIPP1 FHA domain on a glutathioneSepharose 4B column. NIPP1 FHA was further purified using a Superdex75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Finally, NIPP1 FHA was concentrated using a Centriprep 10K ultra filtration system (Millipore) and then applied to NMR experiments. All the NMR measurements were carried out at 25°C and the sample was prepared in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and 150 mM NaCl in the presence of 1 mM DTT. Two- and three-dimensional NMR experiments were performed on Varian UNITY inova spectrometers operating at 800 and 600 MHz. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe (Delaglio et al. 1995) and data analysis was performed with the help of the Sparky program (Kneller and Goddard 1997). 1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignments were carried out using the following set of spectra; 1 H­15N HSQC, 1H­13C HSQC, HN(CO)CA, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HNCO, (HCA)CO(CA)NH, HBHA(CO)NH, HN(CA)HA, HC(C)H-TOCSY, (H)CCHTOCSY, HbCbCgCdHd, HbCbCgCdCeHe, and HACAN. All of the backbone amide resonances were assigned except for Ser7, Gly8, Ser9, Ser10, Gly34 and His98. Nearly complete side-chain assignments were also accomplished. The 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced to DSS according to IUPAC recommendations. Interproton distance restraints for structural calculation were obtained from 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC and 15 N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra using a 100 ms mixing time. The structure was calculated using the CYANA 2.1 software package (Herrmann et al. 2002). As input for the final calculation of the three-dimensional structure of the NIPP1 FHA domain, a total of 3,907 distance restraints were used (Table 1). At each stage, 100 structures were calculated using 30,000 steps of simulated annealing, and a final ensemble of 20 structures was selected based on CYANA target function values. The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code: 2JPE). The overlay of the 20 structures and the ribbon model of the lowest energy structure of the NIPP1 FHA domain are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The N-terminal residues (1­10) exhibited flexible random conformation characteristics. The core structure of the NIPP1 FHA domain (11­132) comprises 11 b-strands linked by several

13

loops to form two large twisted antiparallel b-sheets and an additional short a-helix, essentially identical with those from Rad53 and Ki67, although sequence homology among them was generally low (Fig. 2d). The conserved residues; i.e., Gly52, Arg53, Ser68 and His71 (shown in red in Fig. 2d), were located on the loops at the top of the structure (Fig. 1b, 2a), and the Ne2 of the His71 imidazole ring was protonated even at pH 7.0, which is a common feature of FHA domains. The structures of the loops were well defined as there were a number of NOEs especially among the b3­a, b4­b5, b6­b7 and b10­b11 loops that surround His71 (Fig. 2a). Compared with the structures of the Rad53 FHA1 domain complexed with the pTXXD peptide (Fig. 2b) and the Rad53 FHA2 domain complexed with the pTXXL peptide (Fig. 2c), these loop regions of the NIPP1 FHA domain are considered to recognize the pThr peptide and the conserved residues located on the loops play pivotal roles in the recognition of the pThr residue containing sequence. To identify the pThr peptide recognition site of the NIPP1 FHA domain, the chemical shift changes of the 15N labeled NIPP1 FHA domain upon binding to the synthesized pThr MELK peptide (A470RNQCLKE(pT)PIKIPVNST487) (Sigma) (Vulsteke et al. 2004) were studied using 1H­15N HSQC spectra (Fig. 3a). Several amide peaks were perturbed in an intermediate exchange process but most peaks showed a fast exchange process on the NMR chemical shift time scale (Fig. 3a). The results of the chemical shift perturbation studies are summarized in Fig. 3b and mapped on the NIPP1 FHA domain structure (Fig. 3c). These results suggested that the NIPP1 FHA domain recognized the MELK peptide using the loops at the top of the structure.

chemical shift perturbation studies. The binding site of the NIPP1 FHA domain was quite similar to those identified for other FHA domains. Several FHA domains have target motifs (pTXXD/I/L) and the essential residues of the FHA domains for recognition of the +3 residue (D/I/L) have been examined. The Arg83 side chain of the Rad53 FHA1 domain is required for recognition of Asp at the +3 position (Fig. 2b), and the Ile681 side chain of the Rad53 FHA2 domain interacts with Leu at the +3 position (Fig. 2c). In the NIPP1 FHA domain, Ser66 and Phe117 correspond to those two

residues, respectively (Fig. 2a, d). The replacement of Arg with Ser may abolish the ionic interaction. The Phe117 side chain is located in the hydrophobic core formed by the b5 and b11 and does not seem to interact with the residue at the +3 position (Fig. 2a) since no chemical shift change was observed for F117 upon addition of the MELK peptide (Fig. 3b). The phosphorylated 44-residue hNIFK peptide has an additional binding site at the C-terminus that forms an intermolecular b-sheet with the Ki67 FHA domain, thus enhancing the binding affinity to the Ki67 FHA domain

(Kd = 0.077 lM) (Byeon et al. 2005). The association of the NIPP1 FHA domain with the MELK peptide was weak, since the chemical shift perturbation of the amide peaks was not saturated even at 16 molar equivalents of the peptide (Fig. 3a). Considering that the truncation of 10 residues from the C-terminus of the hNIFK peptide

significantly reduced the binding affinity to the Ki67 FHA domain (Kd = 14 lM) (Byeon et al. 2005), it is possible that the MELK peptide (18 residues) in the present study lacks the additional binding region. Further study is required to elucidate the binding mode of the NIPP1 FHA domain using the longer phosphorylated MELK peptide.
