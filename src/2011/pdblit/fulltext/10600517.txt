Papain was used as an experimental model structure to understand the inhibition mechanism of newly developed specific inhibitors of cathepsin L, the papain superfamily. Recently, we developed a series of cathepsin L-specific inhibitors which are called the CLIK series [(1999) FEBS Lett. 458, 6 ­10]. Here, we report the complex structure of papain with CLIK148, which is a representative inhibitor from the CLIK series. The inhibitor complex structure was solved at 1.7 Å resolution with conventional R 0.177. Unlike other epoxisuccinate inhibitors (E64, CA030, and CA074), CLIK148 uses both prime and nonprime sites, which are important for the specific inhibitory effect on cathepsin L. Also, the specificity for cathepsin L could be explained by the existence of Phe in the P2 site and hydrophobic interaction of N-terminal pyridine ring.

Cathepsin L is one of the most powerful lysosomal cysteine proteases to degrade many proteins and has been implicated as participating in bone collagen degradation by osteoclasts [1]. Cathepsin L-specific inhibitors have not previously been developed because of the difficulty in distinguishing the active site's similarity between cathepsin L and

cathepsin K and also between cathepsin L and cathepsin S. Historically, E64, which is 1-[L-N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-leucyl]amino-4-guanidinobutane, was isolated from a culture of Aspergillus japonicas, and its structure was determined by Hanada et al. [2, 3]. E64 is a potent irreversible inhibitor with low toxicity, but it inhibits all papain superfamily cysteine proteases including not only cathepsin B, K, L, S and H, but also the calpain family. In 1991, we developed the cathepsin B specific inhibitors CA030 and CA074, which were designed to mimic a carboxy-terminal dipeptide by replacing the terminal guanidinobutylamine of E64 with a proline residue and terminating the chain with a free carboxylic group [4, 5]. In 1995, the cathepsin B-CA030 complexed structure demonstrated a tight binding using two hydrogen bonds between C-terminal Pro of CA030 and the imidazole nitrogen of His 110 and His 111 residues on the occluding loop (106 ­124) of cathepsin B [6]. To date, cathepsin B is the only papain superfamily cysteine protease which has an occluding loop [7]. However, papain, cathepsins L, K and S are missing this loop [8 ­11]. Recently, cathepsin L specific inhibitors have been developed by our group and named the CLIK series based on the molecular modeling of cathepsin L structure using a papain coordinate [12]. One of the CLIK group inhibitors shares a common essential structure of carbamoyl oxyrane-2carbonyl-L-phenylalanine in the central domain. The CLIKs showed strict selective inhibition of cathepsin L, but did not inhibit other cathepsins. CLIK148 is a representative inhibitor shown in Fig. 1. CLIK148 shows more than 60% inhibition against cathepsin L at 10 7 M, but no other cathepsins were inhibited. To understand the mechanism of CLIK inhibition, papain could be used as a substitute for cathepsin L, because of the sequence similarity, structural similar-

ity in the active site, and commercial availability. Therefore, we demonstrated the crystal structure of the papain-CLIK148 complex. We addressed the question, why does CLIK148 specifically inhibit cathepsin L. The binding mode is a non-substrate mode, i.e. basically the same as that of E64 [13, 14], but the main difference could be seen in N-terminal part of CLIK148. This structure-based information of CLIK148 leads to suggestions regarding new design for each specific cathepsin (B, L, K, and S) inhibitors. The coordinate of the papain­CLIK148 complex was deposited in the Protein Data Bank as 1CVZ. MATERIALS AND METHOD
Papain from papaya latex was purchased from Sigma. A concentrated solution (approximately 30 mg/mL) of papain was prepared in 20% DMSO. This solution was filtered using 0.22- m membrane and CLIK148 and cysteine was added to 1 mg/mL. Papain-CLIK148 complex was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with 0.1 M aminomethanol, pH 8.9, 0.05 M sodium chloride and 30% methanol. Crystals of the enzyme complex was prepared by cocrystallization. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with a 42.89, b 49.91, c 95.76. The complex crystallized in space group P212121. Data were collected using MacScience DIP2030. The data were processed using the program DENZO and SCALEPACK [15, 16]. The cell dimensions and data collection statistics are listed in Table 1. The crystals belong to space group P212121 which was reported for native papain and various complex crystals. However, for E64 case, two different nonisomorphous crystal of P212121 were reported [14]. The structure of papain-CLIK148 complex was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMORE [17] and the previously solved structure of papain (pdb9pap.ent) as the starting model. The

cross rotation function was calculated using data from 8 Å to 4 Å resulting in the highest peak at a 34.2 correlation coefficient. The translation function was calculated from 8 Å to 4 Å resulting in the highest peak at 40.7 correlation coefficient. The resulting model yielded an R-factor of 38%. At this stage, an Fo-Fc map showed the strong density of 2-carbonyl-L-phenylalanine amide in CLIK148. Several cycles of refinement were performed using XPLOR and model building was done using XFIT [18, 19]. CLIK148 was built using Fo-Fc maps and 179 water molecules was added. The final R-factor was 17.7% and R free value was 21.4% at 1.7 Å resolution.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The structure of papain in the papain-CLIK148 complex is virtually identical to the structure of native papain. The rms difference between native papain and papain-CLIK148 complex is 0.24 Å. Most of the differences observed in side chain positions occur on the surface protein, except for the catalytic Cys 25. The sulfur atom at Cys 25 shifts 0.85 Å to form a covalent bond with the C2 atom of CLIK148, and a similar shift could be seen in E64 binding [14]. One hundred seventy nine ordered solvent molecules were included and all were capable of one or more hydrogen bonds to the solute atoms. Water molecules which have a low temperature factor could be seen at the same position of the apo-papain structure. The electron density of the bound inhibitor is shown in Fig. 2A. Fo-Fc density at the two sigma level obviously shows that CLIK148 exists in the active site cleft. CLIK148 binds covalently to papain between one epoxy carbon and cysteine 25 (Fig. 2B). The binding of

CLIK148 is in the nonsubstrate mode to the active site cleft of the enzyme. At the prime site, the aromaticaromatic interaction could be seen between the pyridine ring of CLIK148 and Trp 177. The distance between the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring and Trp 177 Ne1 is 3.44 Å. Phenylalanine was located in the S2 site. A hydrogen bond is formed between Gln 19 Ne2 and one of the oxygen atom for CLIK148 (2.71 Å). Another hydrogen bond is formed between the Gly 66 peptide nitrogen and the oxygen for CLIK148 (2.97 Å). One ordered water molecule with a temperature factor 37.5 is observed in the active site near His 159 in the complex. This water molecule seems to be important for the binding of CLIK148 to form hydrogen bonds. Three hydrogen bonds can be seen from one nitrogen for CLIK148, Asp 158 carbonyl oxygen and His 159 Nd1 to the water (2.86 Å, 2.89 Å, and 3.72 Å, respectively). CLIK148 is superimposed on the structure of cathepsin B. CA030 and CA074 showed tight binding with the carboxylic acid between two His residues on the occluding loop, but the N-terminal part of CLIK148 is bulky and was blocked by the two His residues [6, 20]. CLIK079 is a similar compound but there is no pyridine part from CLIK148. The binding constant of CLIK079 for cathepsin B significantly increased. The

modeled structure of CLIK079 based on the CLIK148 structure showed that CLIK079 lacks the N-terminal obstacle to bind with cathepsin B, i.e., the occluding loop of cathepsin B prevents binding of the N-terminal pyridine part of CLIK148. CLIK148 is superimposed on the structure of cathepsin L and K. The following two points could be important for cathepsin L specificity. The first point is P2 Phe of CLIK148. When Phe replaced Leu, cathepsin K binding increased significantly. The presence of Leu at position 205 in cathepsin K prevents P2 Phe, while Ala in cathepsin L or Ser in papain creates a sufficient S2 deep pocket for P2 Phe. The second point is the P1 site. The N-terminal pyridine part of CLIK148 is located at the prime site. The S1 and S2 site of cathepsin L and cathepsin K are very similar except for a loop from 140 to 144 (papain: DFQLY, cathepsin L: SFLFY, cathepsin K: SFQFY) Leu 142 exists in cathepsin L on that loop, while Gln 142 exists in cathepsin K and papain. While CLIK148 does not have the P1 Lys, other CLIK group inhibitors have the P1 Lys and share a common essential structure of lysil-carbamoyl oxyrane2-carbonyl-L-phenylalanine amide in the central domain. Lysine at P1 significantly increased the binding to cathepsin K. This can be explained by Lys forming a hydrogen bond with Gln 142 in cathepsin K. However, in CLIK148, Lys is deleted and the specific activity is for cathepsin L. ZPACK with papain is the first complex structure that revealed substrate type inhibitor binding [21]. The papain-ZPACK structure is superimposed on papainCLIK148 (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, even though the binding modes of ZPACK and CLIK148 are opposites, the Phe side chain located in the S2 pocket and each conformation are similar. Recently, vinyl sulfone inhibitors were developed for cathepsin K and cathepsin S [9, 11]. In each case, the P2 residue was Leu for cathepsin K and Phe for cathepsin S, because cathepsin K has a shallow S2 site. These inhibitors also belong to the substrate type binding similar to ZPACK. In CLIK148 case, the Phe was chosen for specific binding with cathepsin L. E64 is nonsubstrate mode representative inhibitor. As indicated above, CLIK148 shows basically the same binding mode as E64, but the specificity for cathepsin L comes from the N-terminal pyridine of CLIK148. CLIK148 is the first E64 derivative using both prime site and non-prime site interaction along the enzyme cleft. Recently the structure of cathepsin K with covalent symmetric diacylaminomethyl ketone inhibitor was revealed [22]. The important structural point of this design is that the inhibitor expands over the cleft of cathepsin K and the Cbz group stacked with Trp177 and Trp181. These features are similar to those of CLIK148. CLIK148 is shorter than the symmetric dia-

cylaminomethyl ketone inhibitor in the prime site, so this allows the pyridine ring of CLIK148 to be closer to the Trp177 using hydrophobic interaction. Development specific inhibitors will contribute not only developing a new medicinal drug, but also will be tools for a new area of biochemistry, though it has required a long time to develop a specific inhibitors of cathepsins, since the discovery of E64. The cathepsin B specific inhibitors CA030 and CA074 were developed within the process of many synthetic epoxysuccinate derivatives of E64 [4, 5]. Currently, CA030 and CA074 are used to clarify the role of cathepsin B in many fields of biochemistry [23, 24]. Cathepsin L is involved in

bone degradation in osteoclast [25], rheumatoid arthritis [26], Ii degradation and CD4 T cell selection in the thymus [27]. Furthermore, using these new CLIKs, other roles of cathepsin L such as RXR degradation were newly understood [28]. The CLIK series was designed using structure and activity relationship together with information about the cathepsin L model structure based on the papain structure (cathepsin L experimental structure was not available). Sequential and structural similarities between papain and cathepsin L are high. In this case, it was useful to use the modeling structure based on the sequence similarity even without experimental coordi-

nate. However, the binding mode of CLIK remains to be clarified, that is, CLIK has a symmetrical structure centered on the epoxisuccinate part. We revealed the binding structure between CLIK148 and papain and this information is important to continue to develop next generation of individual specific inhibitors of cathepsins L, K and S.
