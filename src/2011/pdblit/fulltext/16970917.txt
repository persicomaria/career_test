Abstract Two full-length cDNAs, DNLC2A and DNLC2B, were cloned and characterized. Their open reading frames respectively encode 96 amino acids which are most closely homologous to roadblock/LC7, one member of an ancient dynein light chain protein family, conserved in nematode, fruit fly, mouse and rat. The DNLC2A was expressed in 12 of 16 human tissues examined, with especially strong expression in heart, liver and brain, whereas there was weak expression in lung, prostrate, testis, small intestine and colon. The expression of DNLC2B was generally high compared with that of DNLC2A except in liver. Northern blotting and/or semi-quantitative RT­PCR analysis examined the expression changes of DNLC2A and DNLC2B in 68 hepatocellular carcinoma tissue samples. It was revealed that DNLC2A was up-regulated (45 out of the 68 cases) while DNLC2B was down-regulated (44 out of 68 cases), compared with their adjacent tumor-free liver tissues. Interestingly, among the total 68 liver cancer samples tested, DNLC2A was up-regulated while DNLC2B was down-regulated in 28 cases; DNLC2A was up-regulated while no obvious change was observed for DNLC2B in 10 cases; no obvious change was observed for DNLC2A while DNLC2B was down-regulated in 14 cases. Although the underlying mechanism is not clear to date, the apparent up-regulation of DNLC2A and down-regulation of DNLC2B suggest that these genes might be involved in tumor progression. On the other hand, the different expression changes of the two homologous genes indicate that hepatocellular carcinomas are caused by different pathological mechanisms. In addition, DNLC2A was assigned to human chromosome 20q12­q13.11 near the marker D20S106 by radiation hybrid mapping. q 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Cytoskeletal molecular motors are a group of proteins or protein complexes that are thought to be responsible for a wide variety of cellular functions. These motor proteins enable cells to move, contract, change shape, secrete, endocytosis, organize the cytoplasm, and conduct karyokinesis and cytokinesis (George, 2000).

families: myosins, kinesins and dyneins (George, 2000). Myosins are predominantly present in muscle cells as the only actin-based motors involved in plus-directed (from nuclear towards the membrane) movement of intracellular cargo along actin filaments. Dyneins and kinesins are the microtubule-dependent motors in eukaryotic cells. Kinesins are responsible for the plus-directed cargo trafficking. While the minus end-directed cargo movements are performed by dyneins and minus end-directed kinesins. Cytoplasmic Dynein contains of two or more heavy chains (HCs) of ,530 kDa that form the globular heads and stems of the particles and are believed to be the sites of ATP hydrolysis and microtubule-binding (Bowman et al., 1999; King et al., 1996a). Associated to these dynein stems are intermediate chains (ICs) with multiple Trp­Asp amino acid repeats and several light chains (LCs). ICs act directly in the attachment of the dynein motor to its cargo (King, 2000). LCs is essential for dynein assembly. There is growing evidence

suggesting that these accessory proteins are essential for dynein function and regulation (Bowman et al., 1999; King, 2000). The Drosophila roadblock (robl) protein gene was identified from a genetic mutant that exhibited diverse defects in intracellular transport including a distal biased axonal transport defect, massive axonal loss and nerve degeneration. They also cause severe mitotic defect and female sterile (Bowman et al., 1999; King, 2000). Sequence analysis showed that the protein encoded by Drosophila robl is of 70% similarity to Chlamydomonas dynein light chain LC7 (Bowman et al., 1999). These homologues belong to a conserved new family of dynein-associated proteins whose molecular structure are different from other known dynein light chains, such as human DNLC1 and Drosophilas ddlc, etc. They function in axonal transport, flagellar motility, and mitosis though there is some variability in the number of robl/LC7-like proteins across species (Bowman et al., 1999). In the mammalian expressed sequence tag database, they fall into two classes. However, little is known about how and under what conditions these robl/LC7 proteins modulate dynein activity, and whether they have different expression in the actively growing and proliferating tumor cells. Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the commonest malignant tumors worldwide and a leading cause of death in many countries, especially in Asia and Africa (Bosch, 1997; Murray and Lopez, 1997). Accumulating evidence suggests that HCC may arise through accumulation of a number of genetic lesions besides some well defined risk factors, such as chronic viral hepatitis, alcohol, and metabolic disorders, in the contest of increased cellular turnover induced by chronic liver injury, regeneration and cirrhosis (Moradpour and Blum, 2000; Brechof et al., 2000). As generally observed in other tumors, the genetic lesions contributing to the development of HCC may include activation of cellular oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, over-expression of certain growth factors, and possibly telomerase activation and DNA mismatch repair defects (Bucndia, 2000; Chordhury et al., 1996). Besides these common causes for HCC carcinogenesis, some other proteins such as DNLC-1 were also reported to be overexpressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Fung et al., 2000), and promote cell survival and inhibit apoptosis. LC8, another dynein light chain, also named PIN (protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase), can inhibit nerve growth factor withdrawal apoptosis in differentiated pc12 cells. However, these findings are, in most cases, dependent on precedent knowledge based on oncogene analysis in other types of cancer. Therefore, the wide variety of genetic differences between HCC and tumor-free liver remain to be elucidated. Here, we report cloning and characterization of two novel members of human DNLC family and describe the results of the expression changes of the two novel genes in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from 68 Chinese patients.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Identification of the expressed sequence tag sequences To find new members of the human DNLC, the nucleotide sequence of the Rattus norvegicus robl/LC7-like gene 1 (GenBank accession no. AF073839) was used to screen the human EST divisions of the GenBank database at NCBI. A number of ESTs (D80282, D59735, W17228, A120752, D61624, AA340594, etc.) were obtained and assembled into two EST-contig, termed RD1 and RD2. 2.2. Cloning and sequencing To obtain full-length cDNA sequence of RD1 and RD2, we designed two pairs of specific primers, RD1-A (5 0 GGACTCGCTAAGTGTTCGCTACG-3 0 ), RD1-B (5 0 GGTCACTGGATTGGTGTGAGTGG-3 0 ), RD2-A (5 0 TCCGCGATGGCAGAGGTGGAGG-3 0 ), and RD2-B (5 0 ACAGCCTTGGCCATCGCAGGTC-3 0 ) according to the two EST-contig sequences. PCR amplification was performed on several human cDNA libraries (Clontech). RD1-specific fragment was amplified from human liver cDNA library and RD2 fragment was from testis cDNA library. The two fragments were confirmed to be identical to the above-mentioned EST-contig sequences by sequencing. The specific cDNA fragments (RD1 and RD2) were subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced again. The sequencing results confirmed the validity of the two EST-contig sequences. 2.3. Chromosomal localization Chromosomal localization of DNLC2A was performed by typing Genebridge 4 RH panel (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL) with gene-specific primers rhA (5 0 -GGACTCGCTAAGTGTTCGCTACG-3 0 sense primer), rhB (5 0 -TAAAGTGCTTGGCAGAGCCTGCC-3 0 ); PCR amplifications were performed at 94 8C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles (93 8C for 1 min, 63 8C for 1 min, and 72 8C for 1 min). 2.4. Tumor samples and cell lines Fresh surgical specimens of liver cancer tissues diagnosed histologically as hepatocellular carcinoma and their adjacent normal tissues from 68 Chinese patients were obtained from Qidong Liver Cancer Institute, Jiangsu Province, and from Department of Liver Cancer, Tumor Hospital of Guangxi Province, China (Table 3). The materials were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280 8C. Seven cell lines were used in the study and their origins were as follows: malignant melanoma A375, hepatocyte carcinoma HepG2 and SK-hep-1 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Hepatocyte carcinoma QGY-7703, BEL-7402 and liver L-02 cell lines were obtained from Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. QGY-7703 cell lines were

Semi-quantitative RT­PCR analysis cDNA was synthesized using 2 mg of total RNA, Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco BRL) and Oligo(dT)15 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Firststrand cDNA was subjected to RT­PCR amplification on FS-918 DNA Amplifier (Shanghai Fusheng Institute of Biotechnology). The concentration of templates were regulated to be about 1 ml per 25 ml PCR reaction volume by amplifying (60 8C, 30 s) for 30 cycles. The latter two pair primers were designed based on the b2-MG cDNA sequence (AF) (Kondoh et al., 1999). To determine the best number of

2.5. Total RNA isolation and Northern blot Total RNA was extracted from hepatocellular carcinoma and their adjacent normal tissues, using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-five micrograms of total RNAs were denatured, run on a denaturing formaldehyde 1% agarose gel and blotted onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond-N 1nylon membrane, Amersham) by capillary transfer according to the manufacturer's protocols. The nylon membranes containing total RNA of 12 HCC and their adjacent tumor-free liver tissues and the multipletissue Northern blot membranes (MTN I and II, Clontech), were hybridized with the 32P-labeled DNLC2A and DNLC2B cDNA probes. Pre-hybridization, hybridization, and washing were performed according to the supplier's recommendations. After the membranes were washed, they were exposed to X-ray film at 280 8C for 4 days. Specific band intensity was measured using Complete Gel Documentation and Analysis System GDS8000.

cycles, PCR was performed for 20­36 respective cycles. The PCR products from each cycle were run on 2% agarose gel electrophoresis photographed and then quantified by gel imaging system (GDS8000, UVP Inc). The growth curve of the PCR products was made according to the amount of PCR products of different cycles (Ozaki et al., 2000). Then the best cycle was determined between the increased logarithmic phase and plateau phase. They were 30 cycles for b2MG-C1C2 (60 8C, 30 s) and b2MG-B1B2 (57 8C, 30 s), 29 cycles for DNLC2A-A1A2 (62 8C, 45 s) and 33 cycles for DNLC2B-B1B2 (60 8C, 45 s). Afterwards, the DNLC2A and DNLC2B genes were amplified by using same amounts of the diluted templates with b2MG-C1C2 as the control for DNLC2A and b2MG-B1B2 as the control for DNLC2B. The RT­PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels, then photographed and quantified. 2.8. Statistical analysis t-Tests were used to analyze the difference levels of

DNLC2A and DNLC2B between HCC and their nontumoral liver. The x 2 test was used to analyze the relationship between gene expression level and clinical characteristics.

3. Results 3.1. Cloning of the DNLC2A and DNLC2B cDNA Two contigs were identified by screening the human EST database and were verified by amplifying and sequencing the specific PCR fragments with primers RDA1, A2 and RDB1, B2. The full length of DNLC2A cDNA is 1028 bp (Fig. 1A) (GenBank accession no. AF132750) and of DNLC2B cDNA is 506 bp (Fig. 1B) (GenBank accession no. AF125108), which contain the whole open reading frame. The putative proteins of DNLC2A and DNLC2B both consist of 96 amino acid residues, with a predicted molecular weight of 10.9 and 10.8 kDa, respectively. The two putative proteins show high homology to robl/LC7

DNLC2A has four exons and three introns, which were integrated from two overlapping clones (AL109923 and AL136173) and located between STS G03652 and F15792, which are mapped to chromosome 20q12­q13.11. AIP4 contains 19 exons and 18 introns, and a pseudogene Ferredoxin1 in intron 10. This result is consistent with that of RH mapping. (B) The junctions between introns and exons of DNLC2A.

family of dynein light chain proteins, which were conserved in species from Chlamydomonas (AF140239), Caenorhabditis elegans (Z54216), Drosophila (AF141920), and rat (AF073839) (King et al., 1996a,b; Bowman et al., 1999). The identity of the putative proteins with these robl/LC7 family members in Chlamydomonas, C. elegans, Drosophila and rat is 58, 49, 74 and 96%, respectively (for DNLC2A), and 63, 46, 75, and 76, respectively (for DNLC2B). The identity between DNLC2A and DNLC2B is 77% (similarity 87%) in the amino acid sequences. 3.2. Chromosomal localization and genomic structure of DNLC2A PCR was performed using the GB4 panel (93 samples) as template, and the result was 1011000010101101001111001100101000111101101000011011110100101110101011100000110000011. This result was sent to the Sanger RH Mapping Server for statistical analysis, which showed that the gene was mapped to chromosome 20q12­q13.11, in the order of D20S187, DNLC2A, and D20S106. A BLAST search comparing the DNLC2A cDNA sequence against the non-redundant nucleotide sequence databases identified two human genomic clones (AL109923 and AL136173), which contain the entire DNLC2A gene and atrophin 1 interacting protein 4 (AIP4) gene, and are located on the GenBank Map of chromosome 20 (Fig. 2A). It is consistent with the RH mapping result. Alignments of the end sequences of the two clones established a contig (Fig. 2A). Comparison of this contig sequence with DNLC2A cDNA revealed that DNLC2A contain four exons and three introns (Fig. 2B). The entire gene encompasses at least 25 kb of genomic sequence (Fig. 2A). 3.3. Tissue expression patterns of DNLC2A and DNLC2B To determine the expression patterns of DNLC2A and DNLC2B in normal tissues, Northern hybridization were performed using a 403 bp cDNA fragment from DNLC2A and another 400 bp cDNA fragment from DNLC2B, labeled with [a- 32P]dATP, as probes, respectively. According to the autoradiographic intensity of the hybridization bands, it was found that the expression level of DNLC2A was high in heart, liver; brain and pancreas, moderate in placenta, skeletal muscle, and kidney; low in lung, prostate, testis, small intestine and colon (Fig. 3A). While the expression of DNLC2B was generally high compared with that of DNLC2A except in liver, comparing both expression patterns from DNLC2A and DNLC2B, it is interesting that the expression level of DNLC2B was higher than that of DNLC2A in ten tissues, viz. placenta, skeletal muscle, spleen, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine, thymus, peripheral blood leukocyte and colon, and were equal to that of DNLC2A in five tissues (heart, brain, lung, kidney and pancreas); only in liver was the expression level of DNLC2B notably lower than that of DNLC2A.

3.4. Analysis of expressive change of the two genes in HCC tissues and tumor cell lines To find if there is expression changes of the two novel genes in HCC, Northern hybridization was performed on the total RNA of the liver cancer tissues and the matched tumorfree tissues from 12 HCC patients, with DNLC2A and DNLC2B cDNA as probes. The results showed that the expression of DNLC2A were up-regulated in HCC (Fig. 3C). However, the expression level of DNLC2B was too low to be detected in these samples (data not shown). Semi-quantitative RT­PCR was carried out to observe the expression of DNLC2A and DNLC2B in more HCC patients. First of all, according to the cumulative curve of the PCR products obtained with different primers, the best numbers of cycles used in semi-quantitative RT­PCR were determined between the increased logarithmic phase and plateau phase, respectively (see arrow in Fig. 4A). After that, the expression patterns of DNLC2A in six HCC tissue samples (B10, B19, B13, B20, B21, B27) were examined using the semi-quantitative RT­PCR method (Fig. 4B) and compared with the results from Northern hybridization (Fig. 3C, left). The results from the semi-quantitative RT­PCR and Northern hybridization were the same, which suggested that the RT­ PCR method and conditions used in this study were reliable. Then we examined the expression level of DNLC2A and DNLC2B in seven tumor cell lines, including a liver cell line (L-02), five HCC cell lines (Bel-7402, HepG2, SKhep-1, QGY-7703 and YY-8103) and a malignant melanoma cell line (A375). The results showed that DNLC2A gene was of high expression level in the seven cell lines examined, while DNLC2B gene was highly expressed only in YY-

Lastly, the expression of DNLC2A and DNLC2B in 68 pairs of HCC and their matched tumorfree liver tissues was examined. The semi-quantitative RT­ PCR products of 68 HCC samples were detected by gel imaging system (GDS8000, UVP Inc.) and statistically analyzed by t-test (Tables 1 and 2). The level of b2-MG, as control, was not statistically significantly different (B1B2, P ¼ 0:5974; C1C2, P ¼ 0:8982) between HCC tissues and the matched tumor-free tissues. The expression of DNLC2A in HCC tissues was significantly up-regulated

(P , 0:001) compared with the matched tumor-free tissues, and the expression of DNLC2B in HCC tissues was significantly down-regulated (P , 0:001). On the other hand, the ratio of DNLC2A ton b2-MG was significantly increased (P , 0:001) and the ratio of DNLC2B to b2-MG was significantly decreased (P , 0:001) in HCC tissues against in the matched tumor-free tissues. 3.5.

to tumor-free tissues revealed that DNLC2A was up-regulated in 45 of 68 (66.2%) HCC, while DNLC2B was downregulated or undetectable in 44 of 68 (64.7%) HCC patients (Fig. 5). As shown in Table 3 and Fig. 5, among the total 68 cases, DNLC2A was up-regulated while DNLC2B was down-regulated in 28 cases, DNLC2A was up-regulated while no obvious change was observed for DNLC2B in ten cases, no obvious change was observed for DNLC2A while DNLC2B was down-regulated in 14 cases. Both DNLC2A and DNLC2B were up-regulated in seven cases and down-regulated in two cases. Three cases showed no obvious changes for the two genes. No obvious change was observed for DNLC2B while DNLC2A was down-regulated

in one case, and no obvious change was observed for DNLC2A while DNLC2B was up-regulated in three cases. To further analyze the relationship between the gene expression level and the clinical data in Table 3, the 68 HCCleft were divided into two groups, according to the gene expression change, as follows: (A) the group A1 with up-regulated expression against the group A2 with the unchanged and down-regulated expression for DNLC2A; (B) the group B1 with down-regulated expression against the group B2 with up-regulated and unchanged for DNLC2B; (C) the group C1 with up-regulated in DNLC2A and down-regulated in DNLC2B against the group C2 with other cases. The x 2-test was used for this analysis. The

Fig. 5. The expression of DNLC2A and DNLC2B in 68 HCC cases. Semi-quantitative RT­PCR was performed with DNLC2A or DNLC2B specific primers on the total RNA from HCC and its adjacent tumor-free tissues of 68 HCC cases. Dosage ratio (DR) values of the RT­PCR product density of DNLC2A or DNLC2B in HCC to that in its adjacent tumor-free tissues from 68 cases are shown in the two histograms. In the present study, we defined two critical DR values (DR ¼ 1:5 and DR ¼ 0:67, DR ¼ TR/NR, TR ¼ RT­PCR products density of DNLC2A or DNLC2B/RT­PCR products density of b 2-MG in tumor tissue, NR ¼ RT­PCR products density of DNLC2A or DNLC2B/RT­PCR products density of b 2-MG in adjacent tumor-free tissue) to determine whether the expression of DNLC2A or DNLC2B is down-regulated or up-regulated in a case: if the DR value in a case exceeds 1.5, the expression of DNLC2A or DNLC2B is up-regulated; if the DR value in a case is under 0.67, the expression of DNLC2A or DNLC2B is down-regulated. The upper and the lower broken line in each histogram represent the two critical values, respectively. Asterisks indicate the cases in which DNLC2A was up-regulated while DNLC2B down-regulated (28 out of 68 cases).

results showed that although there were cases of difference in the solitary and multiple tumor between group A1 (S=M ¼ 37=8) and group A2 (S=M ¼ 22=1), and of the histological diagnosis of noncancerous liver tissue (chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis) between the group B1 (CH=LC ¼ 9=35) and the group B2 (CH=LC ¼ 9=15), they had no statistical significance (P . 0:05). Statistically significant differences had not been found between groups A1 and A2, groups B1 and B2, and groups C1 and C2 for other clinical characteristics such as sex, age, HBsAg, a-fetoprotein (AFP), the tumor number and size, the pathologic type of HCC, the histological diagnosis of noncancerous liver, or the Edmondson's grade of HCC.

4. Discussion Dynein is a large protein complex composed of a number of subunits. Dynein heavy chains contain ATPase and motor activities, and intermediate chains are involved in cargo binding, regulated by a group of light chains (King, 2000). However, the functions of LCs remain to be discovered. Until now, eight dynein LCs have been identified, among which LC8 is the most well characterized. LC8 was firstly identified as an integral component of the Chlamydomonas outer dynein arm and is required for outer and inner arm assembly and retrograde intraflagellar transport. Another dynein LC, robl/LC7, recently found in rat, was highly homologous to Drosophila roadblock protein and Chlamydomonas LC7 protein, which play an essential role in dynein function (Bowman et al., 1999). These proteins belong to an

ancient protein superfamily implicated in ATPase regulation (Koonin and Aravind, 2000). There are two classes of these robl/LC7-like genes in mammal based on EST analysis (Bowman et al., 1999; Ye et al., 2000). In this report, two human homologues of robl/LC7-like, DNLC2A and DNLC2B, were identified, and their expression changes in HCC were detected. The full-length cDNA of DNLC2A is 1028 bp, in which there are two stop codons (TGA and TAG) in 5 0 -UTR sequence upstream of the start codon and the 3 0 end contains a poly(A) tract (Fig. 1A). However, no consensus sequence (AATAAA) for polyadenylation signal was found in the 3 0 -UTR of the mRNA. The closest homologies to the polyadenylation signal sequence were ACTAAA or AATAAC, which is similar to that of the rat bobl/LC7-like gene (Ye et al., 2000). On the other hand, the full-length cDNA of DNLC2B is 506 bp, in which there is also a stop codon ahead of the start codon and a consensus sequence (ATTAAA) for polyadenylation signal at the 3 0 UTR (Fig. 1B). DNLC2A and DNLC2B contain the same length ORF encoding 96-amino-acid peptides, which showed 87% similarity. So, the DNLC2A and DNLC2B can be thought to be novel members of robl/LC7 family of mammal, based on their amino acid sequence homology with other mammalian robl/LC7-like proteins (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 3, the tissue expression patterns of the two genes are different in 16 human adult normal tissues tested. The expression of DNLC2A is high in heart, liver, brain and pancreas while the expression of DNLC2B was generally high in normal tissues except in liver (Fig. 3). Interestingly, DNLC2A was highly expressed in liver, while DNLC2B was only slightly expressed. The expression

difference of the two genes in liver may be valuable for analyzing their function. The different robl/LC7-like proteins present in the same organism may contribute to the formation of diverse dyneins with different functions or be involved in tissue-specific expression of diverse dyneins (Hirokawa, 1998). The data from the expression patterns of 16 normal tissues tested and six tumor cell lines suggested that, at the actively growing and proliferating HCC cells, the expressions of the two genes were also different. Furthermore, after statistical analysis, we found that the expression of DNLC2A was significantly up-regulated in the HCC tissues compared with the matched tumorfree liver tissues (P , 0:001), while DNLC2B was downregulated in HCC tissues (P , 0:001) (Figs. 3C and 4B; Tables 1 and 2). Although DNLC2B could not be detected by Northern hybridization in 12 HCC tissues and their paired tumorfree liver tissues, it was detected by semi-quantitative RT­ PCR in all 68 tumor-free liver tissue and in most of the HCC tissues (Tables 1­3 and Fig. 5). These results suggest that RT­PCR is more sensitive than Northern hybridization in detecting lowly expressed genes. Comparing nine clinical features such as sex, age, AFP, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), tumor size and number, and pathologic type, histologic diagnosis of noncancerous liver, Edmondson's grade with the expression level of DNLC2A or DNLC2B in HCC samples from 68 patients, no significant relationship was found between the clinical characterizations and expression levels of the two novel genes. The DNLCs are important for the motor function of dynein, which plays a central role in cell division and intracellular transport (Hirokawa, 1998; Milisav, 1998; Karki and Holzbaur, 1999). The expression change of some DNLC can promote cell survival and inhibit apoptosis, and are also involved in tumor and other diseases. For example, the over-expression of a dynein light chain (protein inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase) inhibits nerve growth factor withdrawal apoptosis in differentiated PC 12 cells (Chang et al., 2000), while the mutation of DNLC1 can cause pleiotropic morphogenetic defects in bristle and wing development, as well as in oogenesis, and hence result in female sterility even lethality through apoptosis (Dick et al., 1996). Human DNLC-1 is over-expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Fung et al., 2000). Although the underlying mechanism is not clear to date, the data in the previous study together with the findings in this work suggest that the apparent up-regulation of DNLC2A or/and down-regulation of DNLC2B might be involved in tumor progression; meanwhile, the different expression changes of the two homologous genes indicate that HCC are caused by different pathological mechanisms. The underlying reason for this alteration of expression pattern may be the distinct request of HCC cells to transport cargoes that are unique or altered in these cells. However, further investigation is required to test this hypothesis and to determine whether the two genes are expressed differently in other tumors.
