ABSTRACT:
A solution NMR-derived structure of a new long -acting, B31Lys-B32Arg (LysArg), engineered human insulin monomer, in H2O/CD3CN, 65/35 vol %, pH 3.6, is presented and compared with the available X-ray structure of a monomer that forms part of a hexamer (Smith, et al., Acta Crystallogr D 2003, 59, 474) and with NMR structure of human insulin in the same solvent (Bocian, et al., J Biomol NMR 2008, 40, 55­64). Detailed analysis using PFGSE NMR (Pulsed Field Gradient Spin Echo NMR) in dilution experiments and CSI analysis prove that the structure is monomeric in the concentration range 0.1­3 mM. The presence of long-range interstrand NOEs in a studied structure, relevant to the distances found in the crystal structure of the monomer, provides the evidence for conservation of the tertiary structure. Therefore the results suggest that this solvent system is a suitable medium for studying the native conformation of the protein, especially in situations (as found for insulins) in which extensive aggregation renders structure elucidations in water difficult

or impossible. Starting from the structures calculated by the program CYANA, two different molecular dynamics (MD) simulated annealing refinement protocols were applied, either using the program AMBER in vacuum (AMBER_VC), or including a generalized Born solvent model (AMBER_GB). Here we present another independent evidence to the one presented recently by us (Bocian et al., J Biomol NMR 2008, 40, 55­64), that in water/acetonitrile solvent detailed structural and dynamic information can be obtained for important proteins that are naturally present as oligomers under native conditions. # 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

odified insulin B31Lys-B32Arg (lysarg-insulin) is a new long-acting insulin analogue of the recombinant human insulin with a stable profile of action. [P. Borowicz, J. Mikolajczyk, S. W. Gumulka et al. (unpublished results) Biotechnological process details and biological activity assays are

available from Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics, 02-516 Warsaw, Poland, on request via e-mail contact.] We have found that this insulin analog is produced by elongation of the carboxy terminus of B chain by lysine in the position 31 and by arginine in the position 32 of recombinant human insulin. These modifications of the insulin primary structure led to a shift of isoelectric point from pH 5.4 in native insulin, to pH 6.7 ± 0.2 making the new analog a soluble insulin preparations at slightly acidic pH and less soluble insulin preparation at physiological pH levels. When injected as a clear acidic solution (pH 4.5) this analog undergoes microprecipitation in the subcutaneous tissue in the form of microdeposits. From those crystals insulin is slowly absorbed over 24 h. For better control the level of glucose in bloodstream of the people with diabetes multiple daily injection are used. Such regimen attempts to mimic normal insulin secretion consisting of basal continuous supply of insulin and extra delivery in the response to a peak in blood glucose, e.g. after meal. In intensive diabetes management of said condition two types of insulin are currently used: rapid-acting insulin at meal-times and long-acting basal insulin. LysArg-insulin belongs to the latter category of insulins. It is therefore essential to know its association properties with respect to the native human insulin as well as its tertiary structure. As regards the former problem it is well established that depending on conditions, insulin exists in different association states, from monomer to hexamer, but its biological function, i.e. control of glucose metabolism,1 is attributed to the monomeric structure2 upon binding to the insulin receptor.3 A drawback in diabetes treatment with insulin, encountered in preparation and stability of formulations,4 is also associated with monomer instability and its propensity to form dimers,5,6 higher aggregates, and fibrils. Two approaches have been discussed and developed experimentally to achieve a monomeric insulin structure in solution, namely; engineering of the C-terminus of the B chain, or disrupting the hydrophobic dimer interface,7­14 and addition to water of an organic cosolvent, which is expected to disrupt quaternary structure without affecting the tertiary structure of the protein.15 Acetic acid (20%, v/v in water) was used, and the structure of insulin was established.16 TFE-d3 (trifluoroethanol (TFE)-d3) (35% in water) was also applied to derive the structure for a human insulin analog.10 Proton chemical shifts were cited for human insulin dissolved in H2O/CD3CN, 65/35 vol %, but details of the structure and analysis of aggregation behavior of insulins in this solvent were not established.17 Here we present the results characterizing the association properties of LysArg-insulin in water using the protocol

described by us.18 This protocol monitors the translational diffusion coefficient, Di, during dilution of the insulin solution. In this account we also present the NMR-derived structure of B31Lys-B32Arg engineered insulin in H2O/CD3CN, 65/35 vol %, pH 3.6 and compare it with the available X-ray structure19 and NMR structures in solution.16 We have shown in our current study that the native human insulin exists in this solvent as a monomer.20 Detailed analysis using PFGSE NMR, dilution experiments and CSI (Chemical Shift Index) proves the existence of monomeric structures in the concentration range 0.1­3 mM of LysArg-insulin in water/acetonitrile solvent at pH 3.6. The presence of long-range interstrand NOEs provides evidence for the conservation of tertiary structure. Therefore the results suggest that this solvent could be considered as a suitable medium for studying the native conformation of a protein. Unlike other denaturating media containing hydrogen bond donors, i.e. acetic acid or TFE, it is probably not capable of involvement in specific hydrogen bonding interactions, particularly at physiological pH around 7.4, and therefore does not interfere with the intrinsic interactions of protein side chain functional groups. While in principle a neat acetonitrile is considered as an excellent hydrogen bond acceptor, in binary mixture (water/ acetonitrile 65:35 vol %) acetonitrile does not act more effectively than water as an acceptor of a proton and the medium largely resembles a pure water. The latter conclusion finds support in a recent vibrational energy relaxation study and hydrogen bonding in water-acetonitrile binary mixtures.21

RESULTS
Establishing of a Monomer Structure in Solution
A number of physicochemical methods has been utilized to study the aggregation of insulin; a nanospray ESI-MS22,23 (ElectroSpray Ionisation Mass Spectrometry) and PFGSE NMR18,24,25 seem to be most promising in providing complementary information on association. The latter method is based on monitoring the translational diffusion coefficients, Di, of species in solution and is therefore specific for differentiation of various aggregates characterized by different hydrodynamic diameter.26 During the present study, using PFGSE NMR, we have exploited the fact that on dilution, formerly aggregated, insulin will tend to dissociate. This process is monitored by the diffusion coefficient, Di, attaining a maximum value for the monomer which has a larger diffusion rate than dimer, tetramer, hexamer, or higher aggregates. Therefore the dilution experiment is run until a constant value of Di is attained. Furthermore, using PFGSE NMR one

822

Bocian et al.

The value of Di in D2O/CD3CN solution is higher for the monomer, 1.53 3 10210 m2 s21, than in pure water. This is accounted by the fact that dilution of water, Di (258C) 20 3 10210 m2 s21, with organic solvent, Di (258C) 40 3 10210 m2s21, makes the resultant solvent less viscous, thereby facilitating faster translational diffusion of a solute. On the other hand, diminished solvation of insulin by water molecules is also expected to influence the diffusion coefficient by affecting its hydrodynamic radius.

Establishing of Secondary Structure Motifs
The chemical shift index (CSI) has become a useful tool in establishing secondary structure motifs in proteins.30 This requires, however, knowledge of a precise random coil chemical shifts of the amino acids in a given solvent. These were established in our recent work justifying use of the Wishart's values for the water/acetonitrile solution.20 In Figure 3 the CSI analysis for Ha protons in chains A and B of Lys-Arg insulin is compared with human insulin pharmacopoeia standard. In chain A the two helices, A2-A8 and A13A19 are clearly established, also the A9-A12 loop. The interruption of regularity in helix A2-A8 occurs at the junction of two cysteins participating in S-S bridges, A6C, and A7C. Helix B8B18 in chain B is clearly seen, and, more importantly, random coil, but not b-sheet, at the C-terminus, B24-B28. This provides evidence for monomer in solution, in agreement with our earlier PFGSE study of diffusion coefficients (vide infra). The CSI graphs for Ca carbon atoms in both chains are given in Figure 3S and Figure 4S (Supplementary Information).

can lift the chemical shift degeneracy between the monomer and dimer which have identical chemical shifts but very different translational diffusion coefficient. In Figure 1, a dilution curve of B31Lys-B32Arg insulin in D2O is presented. As expected, the diffusion coefficient, Di, increases with dilution until a concentration of ca. 40 lM is reached. This concentration was established earlier in the classical work of Kadima et al. as characteristic for monomer of human insulin.27 For sensitivity reasons it was not possible to measure the diffusion coefficient at higher dilution. Current studies for human insulin indicate that at this concentration, using the established values of monomer/dimer association constant, K12 % 1.0 3 104M21 in gas phase23 or 7 3 105M21 28 in solution, there is still appreciable amount of dimer present, ca. (50%). Therefore the largest value of Di measured, 1.08 3 10210 m2 s21, can not be treated as characteristic of Zn-free modified insulin monomer in D2O at 308C, and pH 3.6. By contrast, if monomeric insulin is present in solution, the diffusion coefficient, Di, should remain constant during dilution. A small, linear decrease of Di with increasing concentration is expected, even for monomer, because of a friction, as a result of crowding of the solute species.29 Such a situation is observed in Figure 2, which evidences the existence of monomeric Lys-Arg insulin in D2O/CD3CN (65/35 v/v %), pH 3.6 over a wide concentration range. This makes the applied solvent well suited for the NMR study, all the more that the 1H NMR spectrum has sharp lines and shows dispersion of NH chemical shifts characteristic for structured insulin (Figs 1S, 2S). Worth mentioning is an observation that both spectra in Figs 1S and 2S, for Lys-Arg and native human insulin, respectively show the same dispersion of chemical shifts and narrow lines despite the fact that concentrations of both solutions differ significantly. This strengthens our view that the monomer structure is preserved in a wide concentration range.

Distance and Torsion Restraints
The distance restraints were back calculated from NOESY cross-peaks volumes using program SPARKY (see experimental). In the crowded regions of the spectrum, as shown in Figure 4, only unambiguously assigned no overlapped

imply the helical structure. In particular, the presence of daN(i, i 1 4) together with small 3J(HN,Ha)indicate a-helix. In cysteins, C6, C7, this coupling constant is much higher, characteristic for the extended strand. This is also observed for other insulins studied in pure water, or with organic cosolvent. The A9­A12 loop is well characterized by sequential NOE's due to narrow resonances in this part of a structure, except A11CHa which is rather broad. The structure from A13­A18 is a helix, with nearly complete set of dab(i, i 1 3). The reminder of the A chain occupies the extended structure. B chain character is dominated by B9­B19 helix. This is followed by b-turn B20-B23 and random coil B24­B32. Random coil is also observed in N-terminus of B chain i.e., B1­B9.

some extent, influence the activity of the insulin in solution. The most intuitive result of changes observed in C-terminus of chain B is a decrease of monomer­monomer association constant leading to faster dimer dissociation as released from Zn in physiological conditions (W. Bocian, L. Kozerski et al. unpublished results of association constants studies of insulins in water solution).

The Regions of Increased Intramolecular Dynamic Mobility, a Biological Relevance of a Structure
Figure 7 shows dynamic characterization of a computed model ensemble referred to the X-ray model. Figure 7 shows the rmsd of the backbone atoms from the mean of the ensemble and from the X-ray backbone. Excluding the N- and C- termini of both chains it shows higher rmsd, which may possibly imply increased mobility of the B chain C-terminus B24-B28, an observation consistent with the random coil structure found in this part of the backbone. Using the same argument, also the b-turn in chain B is clearly visible (Gly B20 - ArgB23) as a motif of increased mobility. This is an especially important observation confirming the discussed model of insulin interaction with receptor assuming the B-chain terminus (GlyB20-Thr B30) detachment from the hydrophobic core of the molecule as a first step in receptor binding.10 This mobility is also seen in Figure 6 showing around Gly B20, chain B, the spread in backbone overlaid structures (left structure). The N-terminus of the B-chain is also flexible as expected for the random coil motif. The higher rmsd at the A chain N-terminus may also imply increased flexibility, again in agreement with prediction by the cited model of receptor binding, showing a propensity for the helix

Comparison with Human Insulin Monomer in H2O/D2O:CD3CN (65/35 vol %) Solution
The comparison of both insulins in Figure 6 clearly shows that the Lys-Arg modified insulin has virtually the same tertiary structure as the native human insulin. The main, but obvious difference is seen in the C-terminus of chain B which shows more flexible structure than the native insulin. This is a result of introducing the two additional aminoacids changing the dynamics of this motif. This effect can not be an artifact of a low quality spectra yielding the smaller amount of constraints in this region because not so high flexibility is observed at the A chain termini which were evaluated from the same spectra (comp. Figure 10S). The N-terminus of B chain has also higher flexibility in modified insulin than observed in a native one and the random coil is situated in a different position with respect to the A-chain helix. The deviation from the X-ray geometry in the monomer conformation of Lys-Arg is also noticeable. These differences may, to

unwinding.10 Also remarkable is the similarity of the graphs in Figure 7, which suggests that the mean NMR structure is very close to the X-ray backbone structure. This is a fact further proving the usefulness of water/acetonitrile in protein structure elucidations, especially in situations (as found for insulins) in which intensive aggregation renders structure elucidations in water difficult or impossible.

CONCLUSIONS

The modified insulin Lys-Arg has been characterized in 1H, 13 C, and15 N NMR at natural isotopes abundance by the NOESY, TOCSY, 1H/13C-GHSQC, 1H/15N-GHSQC spectra. The interpretation of these spectra, with the aid of 1H/13CGHSQC-TOCSY spectrum, allowed the 1H, 13C, 15N chemical shift assignment in a main skeleton and in the side chains. These are presented in Table 2S. For comparison, native human insulin chemical shift are presented in Table IIIS. Modified insulin aggregates in water in a range of lM to mM concentration and therefore structural studies can not be conducted in water. Like native human insulin,20 the modified insulin is in the same aggregation state; i.e.,

monomer, in the range of concentrations between 0,1 mM and 3 mM in a water/acetonitrile (65/35 vol %). This solvent is suitable for structure elucidation. Analysis of CSI values and their signs led to establishing the secondary structure motifs in both chains; i.e., A2­A8 and A13­A19 helices in chain A, A9­A12 loop in chain A, b-turn B20­ B23, and B9­B18 helix in chain B. The CSI analysis complements the studies of translational diffusion coefficient in water/acetonitrile (65/35 vol %). It is established now that in this solvent modified insulin Lys-Arg exists as a monomer. This is judged from CSI values in the C-terminus of chain B which evidence random coil but not regular bstructure, which is characteristic of a dimer. The interstrand crosspeaks are numerous and similar in both compared insulins. Large number of interstrand cross peaks in both cases of studied insulins supports the conclusion that the applied solvent disrupts only quternary structure whereas the intramolecular tertiary structure remains essentially unchanged. The comparison of 3J (HA,NH) vicinal coupling constants measured in water/acetonitrile solution, with the ones measured in water, show that the backbone conformation is very similar in both cases. This is

828

Bocian et al.

another proof of the usefulness of the water/acetonitrile solution in structural investigations of proteins. The comparison of both insulins clearly shows that the Lys-Arg modified insulin has virtually the same tertiary structure as the native human insulin. The deviation from the X-ray geometry in the monomer conformation of LysArg is noticeably larger than observed in the native human insulin. Starting from structures calculated by the program CYANA, two different refinement protocols used MD simulated annealing with the program AMBER; in vacuum (AMBER_VC), and including a generalized Born solvent model (AMBER_GB).

NMR Sample Preparation
The preparation of the NMR samples was conducted by the same procedure as described by Weiss et al.,16 except that different solvent was used. The solvent used in the present work is H2O/D2O:CD3CN (65/35 vol %). Solutions of at least 1.7 mM concentration, pH 3.6, not corrected for D, adjusted by adding aliquots of HCl and NaOH, were used for NMR measurements at 308C. The concentrations of samples were measured by UV. The chemical shifts were measured vs. internal CHD2CN (2.04 ppm vs. TSPA, trimethylsilylpropane sulfonic acid, sodium salt). The spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 MHz spectrometer. NOESY spectra32 were acquired using the States-TPPI method33,34 to obtain phase-sensitive data, with a 200 ms mixing time and a 2 s delay before each scan. We are aware of a fact that relatively long mixing time can lead to observation of some indirect effects, which lower the precision of the structure determination. But, for a small molecule as an insulin (6.1 kD), with fairly narrow lines (1.5 Hz of B5 and B10 His aromatic signals) this may not be a serious problem. To minimize zero quantum coherence peaks a small random variation in the mixing time between transients and between t1 increments was used.35 The volumes of NOESY crosspeaks were calculated using program SPARKY.36 TOCSY spectra37,38 were acquired in D2O/35% CD3CN and in H2O/35% CD3CN with a 6000 Hz spectral window in both dimensions. The mixing times for TOCSY (Total Correlation Spectroscopy) spectra were 90 ms with a spin-lock field of 8 kHz. gHSQC spectra.39,40 Echo-antiecho phase sensitive gradientÀ selected 1HÀ 13C HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) NMR spectra were obtained with a spectral width of 5000 Hz, 2048 points in the 1H dimension and 8000 Hz, 800 3 2 increments in the 13C dimension; 128 transients per t1 increment, with a relaxation delay of 1 s and 1J(C,H) 5 135 Hz. 1HÀ 15N GHSQC--Spectral À width of 5000 Hz, 2048 points in the 1H dimension and 1056 Hz, 160 3 2 increments in the 15N dimension; 1024 transients per t1 increment, with a relaxation delay of 1 s and 1J(C,N) 5 86 Hz. E-COSY (exclusive correlation spectroscopy) spectra41,42 were acquired in D2O using a 4800 Hz spectral window and 0.85 s acquisition time. Residual water signal was eliminated using simple presaturation. DQF-COSY (Double Quantum Filtered Spectroscopy) spectra43 were acquired in H2O using a 4800 Hz spectral window and 0.85 s acquisition time. Pulsed field gradient spin echo (PFGSE) spectra were acquired using the BPPSTE44,45 (stimulated echo sequence incorporating bipolar gradients) sequence modified with binomial water suppression. The diffusion time (D) and the duration of magnetic field gradients (d) were 170 ms and 2 ms, respectively. The data were processed using Varian DOSY (Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy)46 and DECRA47,48 packages.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Insulin Preparation
The human insulin (USP standard) was purchased from Sigma and stored at 2208C. The EUP (European Pharmacopeia) standard was a generous gift of BIOTON S.A., Poland, pharmaceutical company.

Lys-Arg Insulin Preparation
Solution of about 4 mg/mL of hybrid protein after renaturation, constructed from a leader protein and amino acid A and B chains of human insulin linked with residues of lysine and arginine, was digested with trypsin, according to the following procedure. Labile groups of amino acids were protected with citraconic group. For that purpose 0.6 mL of citraconic acid anhydride was added dropwise to the 1 L of protein solution at pH about 10. After 30 min of the reaction, an excess of anhydride was removed by adding 1.3 mL of ethanolamine solution. Trypsination reaction was carried out at room temperature for 16 h, 0.25 mg of trypsin per l.1 L of the protein solution was added. Upon completion of the trypsination reaction, pH of the solution was adjusted to 8.0 and the product was purified by chromatography, passing the solution through the column with DEAE-Sepharose gel and eluting the main fraction with Tris buffer (pH 8.0) including 70 mM NaCl and 30% isopropanol. Then the material was subjected to decitraconylation at pH 2.8 (HCl) for 15 h and then zinc salt of Lys-Arg insulin was precipitated by adding 1M solution of ZnCl2 up to the final concentration of 2 mM/dcm3 and adjusting pH to 7.0. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min. A precipitate contained about 0.3 g of dry mass, including 50­60% of pure Lys-Arg insulin. The precipitate was dissolved in 100 mL of diluted hydrochloric acid and purified by HPLC column on Cromasil gel. Elution was performed with a buffer (pH 3.0) including 25 mM of (NH4)2SO4 and up to 50% of isopropanol. The main fraction including the pure Lys-Arg insulin was obtained and its zinc salt was precipitated by adding 2 mM ZnCL2 and adjusting pH to 7.0. The precipitate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min. After drying in vacuumdryer, 0.15 g of pure (96­99%) Lys-Arg insulin with 3.5% Zn was obtained.

Calculation Procedures
The 1451 NOE cross-peaks (classified into three classes: backbone606, sidechain-456 and methyl-389) manually assigned were converted into upper distance constraints with the CALIBA function of CYANA.49 The redundant and meaningless distance restraints were removed and distance limits with diastereotopic groups were adjusted and pseudo atoms were inserted if no stereospecific assignmet was available. This gave 815 restraints. Angle restraints (255)

Biopolymers

NMR Structure of Modified Insulin B31Lys-B32Arg in Water/Acetonitrile Solution were generated from 3J(NHÀ ÀCHa) coupling constants using Karplus function in CYANA and additionally allowed ranges of dihedral angles u, w, were obtained by grid search in function habas (CYANA). A total of 250 structures of insulin with random geometry were generated by CYANA and refined iteratively using the simulated annealing protocol (30,000 total steps) of the torsion angle dynamics CYANA (version 1.0.6). The 200 structures with lowest CYANA target function values were used for further MD refinement in AMBER 9.50 In AMBER calculations additionally to the 815 distance restraints and 255 torsion u, w were used: 9 disulfide, 53 chirality and 52 trans- x restraints.

MD Refinement
The two different refinement protocols were applied using MD simulated annealing: in vacuum and including a generalized Born solvent model.51,52 For the MD refinement in vacuum (VC), the 200 CYANA structures were first energy minimized in vacuum for 500 steps without any restraints, and then two cycles of 15 ps MD simulated annealing in vacuum were performed by SANDER (from AMBER): 0­1000 steps heating the system from 10 to 1100K, 1001­3000 steps leaving at 1100K, 3000­15,000 steps cooling to 0 K, 0­3000 steps tight coupling for heating and equilibration (TAUTP 5 0.2), 3001­11,000 steps of slow cooling (TAUTP 5 4.0­2.0), 11,000­13,000 steps of faster cooling (TAUTP 5 1.0) and 13,000­15,000 steps of fast cooling, like a minimization (TAUTP 5 0.5­0.05), in steps 0­3000 the restraints were slowly increased from 10 to 100% of its final values. ° A cutoff value was set to 15 A. For the generalized Born (GB) refinement 500 steps energy minimization with GB model was first performed on the CYANA structures, followed by two cycles of 15 ps simulated annealing with GB and the same protocol as for vacuum. For further analysis from 200 refined structures, both in vacuum and GB, 100 structures were selected with the lowest violation energy and, next from these, final 50 structures with the lowest total amber energy were chosen as a structure representatives.

Data Deposition: The coordinates obtained from the refinement with AMBER _GB have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 2rn5. The chemical shifts are cited in Supporting Information and are deposited in BRMB under accession number 11018. The RCSB ID is rcsb 150053.
