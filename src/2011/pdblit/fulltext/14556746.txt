Abstract A tellurite-resistance genetic determinant was isolated from the pea blight pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pathovar pisi by a shotgun strategy involving a tellurite-selective screening in Escherichia coli. A 1.65 kb tellurite resistance insert was obtained and analysed. It harbours a single complete and functional ORF encoding a deduced protein of 24, 445 Da. The deduced AA sequence shows significant similarities with the complete human thiopurine methyltransferase enzyme, a methyltransferase from Synechocystis and a methyltransferase-like sequence from Bordetella pertussis. The encoded thiopurine methyltransferase activity was demonstrated using a radiochemical microassay for the methylation of 6-mercaptopurine. This gene was detected in most P. syringae legume pathogens. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

tellurite MIC values for cells harbouring pAV605, pAV607 and pBluescript were 4 m g mly1 showing that they were not harbouring any efficient Tel-r activity. The detoxification properties of the resistance process were confirmed by monitoring tellurite consumption in LB broth of the various tellurite-resistant E. coli cells through time using a diethyldithiocarbamate assay w5x. For example, after an incubation period of 31 h, tellurite consumption was 287 m g tellurite per mg proteins per ml while it was marginal Zaround 50 m g tellurite per mg proteins per ml. for cells harbouring the other constructs Z pAV604, pAV605, pAV607 and pBluescript. . After 96 h the consumption level was around 168 and 396 m g tellurite per mg proteins per ml for cells harbouring pAV601 and pAV604, respectively, while it remained marginal for the other constructs Z pAV605, pAV607 and pBluescript. . E. coli harbouring the Tel-r constructs also had the ability to grow at high concentrations of sodium biselenite. The cosmid subclones derived from pAV601 posi-

tioned the Tel-r genetic determinant in a 1.65 kb DNA fragment, which was sequenced Z Fig. 1. .

clones were generated to confirm the position of the detected P. s. pisi complete ORF and its direct involvement in Tel-r ZFig. 1A.. Since the ’rg-18 promoter region of Bordetella pertussis shows identity with the complete ORF of the insert, blast analysis was performed using its deduced AA sequences in all six frames against the databases. Significant similarity, confirmed by Bestfit analysis using P. s. pisi TPMT-like protein ZFig. 2. , was observed between the human TPMT and ’rg-18 promoter region deduced proteins in the q1 and q3 frames. Similarity in two different reading frames suggests either a DNA sequencing artefact creating a frameshift or the presence of a mutated TPMT encoding gene. The significant levels of similarities and identities observed over the full length of the human TPMT gene ZFig. 2. brought us to investigate the methyltransferase activity encoded by this novel Tel-r determinant ZTable 1.. The known substrates for human TPMT Z hTPMT. include the thiopurine drugs 6mercaptopurine Z6-MP. and azathioprine. Cell-free extracts of E. coli harbouring the Tel-r gene were shown to catalyse the S-adenosyl-methionine Z SAM. methylation of 6-MP. This activity was inhibited as reported for the hTPMT w7x by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine ZSAH. which is a product of the TPMT reaction. The Tel-r genetic determinant characterised here was thus named the bacterial thiopurine methyltransferase gene or tpm. TPMT activity among pseudomonads was previously reported by Remy w9x. Internal tpm PCR primers Za314 and 308; Fig. 1. were defined and used to study the distribution of this gene among P. syringae pathovars Zsee Ref. w10x for a description of the bacterial strains and PCR conditions.. PCR fragments of the expected size Z about 600 bp. were amplified from frozen stocks of all P. s. pisi 299A Zrace 1. , 202 Zrace 2. , 870A Z race 3. , 895A Zrace 4., 974B Zrace 5., 1704B Zrace 6. and

DNA probing using the PCR fragment going from primer 314 to 308 ZFig. 1. amplified from pAV604 was performed on EcoRI-digested genomic DNA isolated from some of the above isolates to confirm the validity of the PCR detection. A strong hybridization signal was observed at the 1.5 kb level for the EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from P. s. pisi 299A, 202 and 870A isolates, from the P. s. syringae PS61 isolate, and the 1299A and 1375A P. s. phaseolicola isolates tested. No significant hybridization signal was observed with the digested genomic DNA from P. s. phaseolicola 1281A, P. s. maculicola 1853A, P. s. tomato 19 and P. s. morsprunorum C28 isolates. These hybridizations were in full agreement with the PCR data and confirmed the presence of conserved EcoRI sites upstream Z likely in the orfClike region. and downstream Zlikely in the htpX-like ORF. tpm genes among P. syringae. The tpm PCR fragments were digested by Sau3AI to investigate their relatedness. According to the tpm sequence, two Sau3AI fragments of about 320 and 280 bp are expected for closely related sequences. The 320-bp fragment was observed among all digested tpm PCR fragments obtained while the 280-bp fragment was cut further leading to the presence of a 200-bp fragment for some of the P. s. pisi isolates Z299A, 974B and 1691. and for the P. s. phaseolicola 1299A isolate tpm fragment.

found to be essential for high TPMT activity in human w11x and are conserved in the bacterial TPMT ZFigs. 2 and 3.. However, the substitution of the alanine at position 80 of the human TPMT into a serine in the bacterial enzyme did not seem to affect

The radiochemical microassay described by Weinshilboum et al. w18x was used to demonstrate S-adenosyl methionine methylation of sulphydryl compounds by the bacterial TPMT enzyme. The thiopurine drug 6-mercaptopurine Z6-MP. was used as the methyl acceptor. Z6-MP was used at a concentration of 3.7 mM and S-adenosyl-L-methionine at 25 m M.. TPMT activities are given in counts per minute ZCPM. which represent the relative amounts of methylated 6-MP Z6-MMP. produced per total cellular protein Zextracted and quantified according to Ref. w19x.. See Fig. 1 for a description of the plasmids. a SAH: S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. This result was triplicated in three separate experiments. For the other two experiments, the TPMT activities were as follows: using, respectively, 9.6 and 16.8 mg proteins per reaction, E. coli DH5 a rpAV601 extracts gave 180.8 and 178.5 CPMrmg proteins and pAV601 extracts with SAH 17.1 and 21.8. E. coli DH5 a rpSK- was used as a control and TPMT activities were in the range of those reported in the table. b The TPMT activity obtained without 6-MP was subtracted from these values. This value averaged around 17.5 CPMrmg proteins.

here could be involved in the volatilization of telluriterselenite into dimethyl telluriderselenide while being also involved in the detoxification of other molecules like thiopurines. Doran w13x proposed a biomethylation pathway of selenite into dimethyl selenide that seems to share many similarities with this tpm-related telluriterselenite resistance process. In the selenite methylation pathway presented by Doran w13x, the main product of the reductaseZ s. would be a persulfide analog preceded by the metallic form. Metallic telluriumrselenium was always observed during the tpm-mediated Tel-rrSel-r process described here. Moreover, Remy w14x observed considerable nonspecificity toward the methyl acceptors for TPMT suggesting that the persulfide analog can be a likely intermediate in the resistance process. The requirement of S-adenosyl-methionine as a methyl donor in both processes Z Doran's methylation pathway and the tpm resistance process. also adds further support for an involvement of the thiopurine methyltransferase in the methylation pathway. Methane tellurolrselenol could be an intermediate in such a methylation process. Methane selenol has been detected in fungal cultures producing dimethyl selenide w15x. This biological pathway would then finally lead to the volatilization of telluriumrselenium into d im e th y l te llu r id e r s e le n id e . D im e th y l telluriderselenide could be further methylated in higher organisms as reported for mouse w16x by a thioether S-methyltransferase ZTEMT. into a trimethyltelluroniumrtrimethylselenonium ion to increase the aqueous solubility of the end-product and facilitate its excretion in urine. The TEMT enzyme has not been reported in bacteria. We are now trying to identify the selective pressures which maintained TPMT in phytopathogenic P. s. pisi. Tellurite is rarely observed in the environment and it might be its similarities with other more common molecules Z which would be the main selective
