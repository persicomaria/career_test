Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of the insulin and leptin receptor pathways and thus an attractive therapeutic target for diabetes and obesity. Starting with a high micromolar lead compound, structure-based optimization of novel PTP1B inhibitors by extension of the molecule from the enzyme active site into the second phosphotyrosine binding site is described. Medicinal chemistry, guided by X-ray complex structure and molecular modeling, has yielded low nanomolar PTP1B inhibitors in an efficient manner. Compounds from this chemical series were found to be actively transported into hepatocytes. This active uptake into target tissues could be one of the possible avenues to overcome the poor membrane permeability of PTP1B inhibitors.
1. Introduction Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1Ba) is a negative regulator of the insulin and the leptin receptor pathways.1-4 Two independent studies of PTP1B-deficient mice have revealed phenotypes of enhanced insulin sensitivity, improved glycemic control, and resistance to high fat diet induced obesity.5,6 Furthermore, treatment of diabetic mice with PTP1B antisense oligonucleotides reduced the expression level of the enzyme and subsequently normalized blood glucose and improved insulin sensitivity.7,8 Thus PTP1B has been considered as an attractive therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes and obesity.9-11 Small molecule inhibitors of this enzyme have been pursued extensively by both industry and academia.12-21 However, compounds that have good potency and are readily accessible to target tissues remain elusive.22,23 Our PTP1B small molecule inhibitor program started with a weak but well characterized lead compound, 1, which binds to the enzyme active site (site A) and has a Ki value of 230 µM (Figure 1).24 Early exploration of the inhibitor scaffolds resulted in the discovery of a tricyclic compound, 2 (Ki ) 9.2 µM), which was 25 fold more potent than 1.24 This result suggested that the bicyclic thienopyridine template was not required for enzyme inhibition. Upon further exploration, it was later discovered that the pyridyl ring could be completely removed and resulted in the design and synthesis of 3, a compound that was 70-fold

more potent than our starting lead 1.25 An X-ray cocrystal structure of PTP1B and 3 revealed that the 3-position was pointing toward the second phosphotyrosine binding site (site B), a site that has been shown to offer opportunities for both potency and selectivity improvement.26,27 Attempts to bridge a fragment for site A and a fragment for site B using flexible linkers have produce mixed results.28 Although notable success was achieved by scientists from Abbott Laboratories,16,29 the use of flexible linkers may have incurred a high degree of rotational freedom. This in turn may be responsible for the poor physical-chemical properties for the overall molecules. Our approach was to build our PTP1B inhibitors from site A toward site B using rigid functionality in a stepwise manner, in which atom efficiency could be optimized along the way as guided by X-ray complex structures. Our structure-based effort resulted in significant improvements in potency and selectivity and is discussed herein. 2. Chemistry The synthesis of PTP1B inhibitors started with alkylation of 4 with ethyl bromoacetate or tert-butyl bromoacetate, followed by Suzuki coupling with various boronic acids to provide 6a-c in good yields (Scheme 1). The Suzuki coupling reaction was highly regioselective toward the C5-position when Pd(PPh3)4 was used as the catalyst and THF was used as the solvent in the reactions.25 Intermediate 6a was further derivatized according to standard procedures to give various amides, ureas, sulfonamides, carbamates, and alkylamino analogs 7.30-32 Intermediate

Final deprotection using LiOH in THF/water completed the synthesis of compounds 26-55. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Structure-Activity Relationship. The 3-position of 3 offers a favorable trajectory toward the second phosphotyrosine binding site, as revealed by previously reported X-ray complexes of 3 and PTP1B.25 To effect the extension of the molecule from the active site toward the second phosphotyrosine binding site, an amino or a hydroxyl group was introduced as a functional handle. Compared to compound 3, a hydrogen bond donor such as an amino (8) or a hydroxyl group (9) at the 3 position provided slight improvements in potency, 2-3-fold, respectively (Table 1). Removal of the hydrogen-bond donor on compound 9 and replacing it with a methoxy group (10) caused a 4-fold decrease in inhibitory activity. Furthermore, attempts to increase the acidity of the NH on compound 8 using amides (e.g., 11, 12), ureas (e.g., 13), and carbamates (e.g., 14) did not translate into better inhibitory activity. The structure-activity relationship remained flat and the Ki of these compounds remained around 2 µM. These results suggested that a hydrogen-bond donor, presumably interacting with Asp48, might be favorable at the 3-position. However, the directionality of the hydrogen bond was not as optimal as that between a hydrogen-bond donor (e.g., OH or NH) at the 4-position and the Asp48 residue, which has been reported previously.25 Some sulfonamide analogs did provide modest improvements in potency (e.g., 15 vs 8). However, it was not clear whether the acidity of the NH group or the hydrogen-bonding played a significant role because the NH-benzyl (16) or O-benzyl (17) groups offered similar improvement in inhibitory activity. In the case of compound 17, there is no hydrogen-bond donor at the 3-position. Thus, van der Waals interactions between the inhibitors and the enzyme might be more important. The X-ray complex structure of 16 and PTP1B provided the first hint of our success in extending the inhibitor into the second phosphotyrosine-binding site (Figure 2). The benzyl side chain of 16 has passed through the "gateway" between the active site and the second phosphotyroine binding site, which is lined with the Gly259 residue. Consistent with the structure-activity relationship (SAR) in Table 1, the benzyl group of 16 bends toward Met258 and forms a van der Waals contact with its side chain. This is the key contributing factor for the potency improvement in the case of 16 and 17 (the X-ray complex structure of 17 and PTP1B has also been solved, but is not shown here; the benzyl group of 17 overlays nicely with that of 16).

Reagents and conditions: (a) tert-butyl 4-oxopiperidine-1-carboxylate (or tert-butyl 4-formylpiperidine-1-carboxylate), NaBH(OAc)3, AcOH, DCE, rt; (b) HCl/EtOAc/MeOH, rt; (c) method A, chloroformate, pyridine, rt; method B, isocyanate, DMF, rt; method C, sulfonyl chloride, pyridine, rt; (d) LiOH·H2O, THF/H2O, rt.

6b was alkylated with benzyl bromide to give the precursor of compound 17. Hydrolysis of 6a-c and 7 using LiOH in THF/ water provided the compounds 8-23 in good to excellent yields. Compounds 26-55 were prepared by following the reaction steps in Scheme 2. The synthesis started with intermediate 6a or 6d-f, which were prepared according to the procedures in Scheme 1. In the synthesis of 6d, methyl 4,5-dichloro-3hydroxythiophene-2-carboxylate was prepared by following literature procedures33 and was subsequently used in the Suzuki coupling reaction. Reductive amination of 6a (or 6d-f) and tert-butyl 4-oxopiperidine-1-carboxylate (or tert-butyl 4-formylpiperidine-1-carboxylate) gave intermediate 24. Deprotection with TFA in CH2Cl2 and subsequent reactions with acid chlorides, chloroformates, isocyanates, or sulfonyl chlorides in the presence of DIPEA provided intermediates 25 in good to excellent yields.

The SAR at the 3-position has been expanded to include a variety of cycloalkyl groups (Table 2), in order to optimize van der Waals interaction with the Met258 side chain. Indeed, unsaturated cycloalkyl groups (18-21) also increased inhibitory activity significantly, with Ki values 2-4-fold better than that of the corresponding benzyl analog (16). Cyclohexylmethyl (18) and cyclohexyl (19) analogs have similar potency (Ki  200 nM), but the latter have better atom efficiency due to the lack of a methylene spacer. Incorporation of an oxygen atom on the cyclohexyl ring as in the case of compound 22 resulted in little change in potency against the PTP1B enzyme. The X-ray complex structure of 19 and PTP1B revealed the orientation of the cyclohexyl ring, which lies flat along the tunnel wall between the active site and the second phosphotyrosine binding site (Figure 3A). The side chain of Arg24 adopts a folded-down conformation to line the outer wall of this tunnel. In contrast, the Arg24 side chain generally adopts a fold-up conformation in the apo protein34,35 and in the complex structures of inhibitors without a side chain into the second phosphotyrosine binding site (e.g., 3 and PTP1B).25 Consistent with that of compound 16 (Figure 2), van der Waals interactions between the cyclohexyl group of 19 and the Met258 side chain play an important role in binding affinity. In addition, the cocrystal structure revealed opportunities for further improvement of these van der Waals interactions (Figure 3A). There is a small hydrophobic "hole" next to Met258, a residue against which the cyclohexyl side chain of 19 packs. Molecular modeling suggested that a methyl group extending out from the 3-position of the cyclohexyl ring could provide a good fit into this hydrophobic cavity (Figure 3A,B). To avoid introducing chirality into the molecule, compound 23 was designed and synthesized with a symmetric 3,3,5,5-tetramethylcyclohexy-

lamino group introduced at the 3-position of 3. Confirming the molecular modeling prediction, the presence of the methyl groups at the 3-position of the cyclohexyl ring significantly improved inhibitory activity against PTP1B. Compound 23 has a Ki of 36 nM, almost an order of magnitude better than that of 19. More interestingly, the binding mode of 23 to PTP1B was exactly as predicted by molecular modeling, with a methyl group nicely filling the hydrophobic "hole" next to Met258 side chain (Figure 3C). The design and synthesis of 23 was inspired by structural information from X-ray complexes. Though a potent and efficient inhibitor of PTP1B enzyme, compound 23 does not fully occupy the second phosphotyrosine binding site (Figure 3C). Its 3,3,5,5-tetramethylcyclohexyl side chain is still some distance from Phe52 and Ala27, the residues that are situated at the far end of this site. These residues are different in PTP1B vs in T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP),27,36 which may offer an opportunity for selectivity. To extend the molecule further into the second phosphotyrosine binding site, an aminopiperidine group was introduced at the 3-position of 3 as a functional handle (Scheme 2). Compound 26 (Ki ) 3.8 µM), with the piperidine group, was much less active than 19 (Ki ) 0.21 µM), which might due to the proximity of its basic nitrogen to residues Arg24 and Arg254 (Table 3). Neutralizing the basic nitrogen of 26 with amide (e.g., 27), carbamate (e.g., 28), and urea (e.g., 29) recovered the inhibitory potency against PTP1B (Ki  0.2-0.3 µM). What really stood out among the various modifications was the methylsulfonamide analog 30, with a Ki of 44 nM, even though it lacked the methyl groups of compound 23. Replacing the methylsulfonamide (30) with a phenylsulfonamide (31) did not offer any added benefit. However, inserting a methylene spacer between the sulfonyl group and phenyl group resulted in a significant improvement in potency. Compound 32, the first single digit nanomolar compound in this chemical series (Ki ) 4 nM) was thus obtained. The potency of this chemical series could be further improved by fine-tuning the substitution at the 4-position of the thiophene template, which presumably adjusts the positioning of the benzyl sulfonamide side chain in the second phosphotyrosine binding site. The attempt to synthesize a tetramethylpiperidine sulfonamide was not successful. Replacing the bromo group (32) with a hydrogen (33) also resulted in significant loss in potency (almost 3 orders of magnitude). While a methyl group (34) was tolerated here, a chloro group (35) provided the best potency with subnanomolar activity against PTP1B (Ki ) 0.68 nM, Table 3). In general, replacing the 4-bromo with a 4-chloro group

offered about 4-6-fold improvement in potency (analogs of 23 showed the similar trend; data not shown). Compared to the original lead (1), this structure-based optimization effort produced a compound (35) that is >300 000-fold more potent. Fine-tuning the linker region of 32 was also attempted with representative examples shown in Table 4. Replacing the NH linker (32) with an oxygen atom (36) at the 3-position resulted in a slight loss of potency (6-fold). Inserting a methylene between the NH and the piperidine benzyl sulfonamide (37) was not favorable. In the case of compound 37, shortening the side chain by removing the methylene on the sulfonamide side (38) resulted in further loss of activity. Surprisingly, replacing the sulfonamide side chains with a phenyl urea group (39) regained single-digit nanomolar potency. The NH linker of 39 could be interchanged with an oxygen linker (40) without a significant loss in potency (Table 4). The X-ray complex structure of 32 and PTP1B clearly indicates how this compound interacts with the enzyme (Figure 4). Compound 32 fully occupies both the active site and the second phosphotyrosine binding site, with the thiophene head group at the active site and the benzylsulfonamide group at the second site. One of the sulfonyl oxygens forms a hydrogen bond with a backbone amide, and the other oxygen interacts with Arg24 and Arg254 via water-mediated hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bond interactions may compensate for the loss of the van der Waals interaction between the methyl group of 23 and Met258. This likely explains why compounds 30 and 23 have similar potency. The benzyl group caps two water molecules at the second phosphotyroine binding site and interacts with

Phe52 in a edge-to-edge fashion. All these interactions combined in an additive fashion result in the high affinity of 32 to PTP1B enzyme. 3.2. Selectivity against Other Phosphatases. In addition to potency improvements, one added benefit for extending PTP1B inhibitors from the active site into the second phosphotyrosine binding site could be improving selectivity against other protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases). Assay results of three representative compounds, 3, 23, and 32, against four different phosphatases (PTP1B, CD45, LAR, and TCPTP) are shown in Table 5. Compound 3, which resides only at the active site, has excellent selectivity against LAR (>150 fold), good selectivity against CD45 (87 fold), but is more active against TCPTP (2-3-fold more active against TCPTP vs PTP1B). Compound 23, the side chain of which has entered the second phosphotyrosine binding site, improves selectivity against CD45 (4200-fold). The improved selectivity between PTP1B and CD45 may be partially due to the differences at the gateway between the active site and the second phosphotyrosine binding site of these two enzymes.26 PTP1B has a glycine (Gly259) lining the bottom of the gateway, while CD45 has the bigger amino acid, leucine. In addition to steric hindrance at the gateway, other interactions between the inhibitor and the second phosphotyrosine binding site may also contribute to selectivity. Compound 32, which fully occupies both the active site and the second phosphotyrosine binding site, shows the best selectivity against CD45 (19 000-fold). Furthermore, compound 32 has shifted the relative selectivity between PTP1B and TCPTP when compared to compound 3 (Table 5). To further probe the second phosphotyrosine binding site and the relative selectivity between PTP1B and TCPTP, various substitutions on the phenyl groups of 32 (series A) and 39 (series B) were examined. Some representative examples are shown in Table 6. In general, the potency and relative selectivity of these analogs has the following order: ortho > meta > para (e.g., 41 vs 42 vs 43). This is consistent with the X-ray complex structure of 32 and PTP1B (Figure 4), in which the para-position of the benzyl group packs tightly against the protein surface and thus does not allow further substitution. Therefore, effort was concentrated on exploring the effect of ortho-substituents on potency and relative selectivity between PTP1B and TCPTP. For analogs of 32 (series A), various substituents are tolerated (44-50). The best potency (1 nM) and relative selectivity (2fold) was seen in compound 50, with a methylsulfonamide group at the ortho-position. Analogs of 39 (series B) show a similar trend (ortho > meta > para, data not shown). Again, relative selectivity between PTP1B and TCPTP ranges from 2- to 3-fold (e.g., 51-54). In conclusion, extending the PTP1B inhibitor into the second phosphotyrosine binding site does improve selectivity against other PTPases (e.g., CD45). However, the potential of this site for significantly distinguishing PTP1B from TCPTP remains a challenge, due to the high homology of these two enzymes.15 3.3.

has good aqueous solubility (>100 µg/mL at pH 7.4 buffer). However, permeability across biological membranes is limited due to its polar head group. Its Caco-2 permeability coefficient (Pe) is less than 1 × 10-6 cm/s. The stability of 32 in liver microsomes has been profiled across three different species. It has good stability in human (T1/2 >60 min), mouse (T1/2 >60 min), and rat (T1/2 46 min) liver microsomes. Furthermore, compound 32 shows little inhibition of various cytochrome P450 enzymes (IC50 > 500 µM for CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and 40 µM for CYP2C9). Therefore, there appears to be little concern about potential clinical drug-drug interactions for this compound. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of 32 has been examined in two species: male Sprague-Dawley rats and C57/B6 mice. In rats receiving a single iv (intravenous) bolus injection of 2 mg/kg, compound 32 has a low plasma clearance (CL  7 mL/min/ kg) and a long elimination half-life (t1/2 10 h). This is in good agreement with the excellent in vitro stability of this compound in liver microsomes. Further PK studies were carried out in mice where compound 32 was administered into mice at 10 mg/kg via ip (intraperitoneal) injection. Compound concentrations in plasma were evaluated at various time points, and the tissue concentrations in liver and muscle were measured at 1 and 7 h after ip injection (Table 7). The Cmax of 32 in plasma was observed at 1 h after ip administration, with a mean concentration of 15.2 µM (N ) 3). Surprisingly, a substantial amount of 32 was observed in both liver and muscle tissues at the 1 h time point, despite the low membrane permeability of this compound. The corresponding mean ( SD concentration in the liver and muscle was 6.9 ( 2.1 and 3.5 ( 2.7 µM, respectively. At the 7 h time point, compound concentrations deceased significantly in all tissues including plasma to a range of 0.20.4 µM.

5.1. Chemistry. Commercial reagents and solvents were used as received without further purification. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer. LC-MS data were collected using a Micromass LCT mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization in conjunction with a Waters 2795 LC system. Liquid chromatography (LC-MS) was performed using a Phenomenex C18 column (Mercury MS Luna 5µ C18(2), 20 × 2 mm) with mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid (FA) in H2O (A) and 0.1% formic acid in MeCN (B) and a gradient of 15-100% B in 3 min followed by 1.5 min at 100% B. HRMS data were recorded on a Bruker APEXIII-7T FTMS spectrometer with electrospray ionization. Purity of compounds was also analyzed by RF-HPLC using the following two conditions: (1) H2O/MeCN/0.1% FA; (2) H2O/ MeOH/0.1% FA (a gradient of 5-100% B in 7 min followed by 2 min at 100% B). 4,5-Dibromo-3-ethoxycarbonylmethoxythiophene-2-carboxylic Acid Methyl Ester (5). General Procedure of Alkylation. Potassium carbonate (13.07 g, 94.7 mmol) and ethyl bromoacetate (10.5 mL, 94.7 mmol) were added to a 150 mL of a DMF solution of 4,5-dibromo-3-hydroxythiophene-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester (20 g, 63.1 mmol). The resulting suspension was stirred at 50 °C overnight. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, followed by addition of 200 mL of Et2O.

3.4. Cellular Uptake. Compound 32 showed low membrane permeability in the Caco2 assay and thus was expected to have low accessibility to target tissues such as liver and muscle in vivo. However, a significant amount of 32 was detected in liver tissue during the ip PK study in C57/B6 mice (Table 7). This surprising observation was suggestive of a possible active uptake mechanism. Since compound 32 exists as an anion under physiological conditions, it was suspected that one or more organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) may be involved in its delivery into liver tissues. To evaluate this possibility, an experiment was performed to study the uptake of 32 into primary rat hepatocytes in the absence and presence of an OATP inhibitor, verapamil.37 Fexofenadine, a known substrate of OATPs, was used as a positive control in this experiment.37,38 The results of this study are summarized in Figure 5. The OATP inhibitor, verapamil, caused an 87% decrease in the uptake of fexofenadine into hepatocytes. Comparably, a 70% decrease in the uptake of 32 was observed in the presence of verapamil. This supports the hypothesis that 32 is a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptides and is indeed actively transported into hepatocytes. Thus, the high concentration of 32 in liver tissues during PK studies could be attributed to its active uptake. In vitro systems such as OATPexpressing or transfected cells (e.g., HeLa, MDCK or Xenopus laeVis ooctyes)39 may help to further assess the involvement of different rat (OATP1, 2 or 4) or human (OATP1B1, 1B3 or 2B1) OATPs in the hepatic uptake of 32 or analogs. Results of in vivo experiments following ip dosing in ob/ob mice were not reproducible and therefore cannot be used as an in vivo proof of concept. Further work on the use of prodrugs of these potent inhibitors for demonstration of in vivo efficacy will be reported separately. 4. Conclusion PTP1B is an attractive therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes and obesity. The nature of its active site, which favors highly polar molecules, has created difficulties for drug discovery. The present report demonstrates a successful use of structural information in guiding the extension of PTP1B inhibitors from the active site to the second phosphotyrosine binding site to improve potency and selectivity in an efficient manner. A more than 300 000-fold improvement in potency was achieved using this approach (1 vs 32). Furthermore, careful examination of PK data led to the discovery of an active uptake mechanism of this class of compounds (e.g., 32) into hepatocytes. This could be a possible avenue to overcome the low passive diffusion and thus poor tissue accessibility of polar PTP1B inhibitors. Future effort in further improving the physical-chemical properties

The enzymatic assays were carried out at room temperature in 96-well plates. The assay buffer contained 50 mM 3,3-dimethyl glutarate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM TCEP, and 0.01% Triton (pH 7.0 with ionic strength of 0.15 M adjusted by sodium chloride). The reaction was initiated by addition of the enzyme at a final concentration of 10 or 100 nM for PTP1B, 20 nM for TCPTP, 20 nM for CD45, and 270 nM for LAR, respectively. The initial rate of the PTPase-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenol phosphate (pNPP) was measured by following the absorbance change at 405 nm. IC50 values were determined under a fixed pNPP concentration of 1 mM. All the assays were carried out in duplicate or triplicate, and the average results are presented. Inhibition constants (Ki) were derived from each IC50 based on competitive inhibition Ki ) IC50Km/(Km + [substrate]). For tight binding inhibitors, Ki is calculated from nonlinear fitting based on the tight binding equation V) V0 × [ (E0 - I0 - Kapp)2 + 4E0Kapp + (E0 - I0 - Kapp)] 2E0 Ki ) Kapp IC50 ) Ki

where V and V0 are initial activity in the presence and the absence of inhibitors, E0 is enzyme concentration, I0 is inhibitor concentration, Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant, and S is the substrate concentration. Data shown are representative of at least two independent determinations with a less than 2-fold difference between measurements. PTPases used in the assays were recombinant human PTP1B (hPTP1B catalytic domain, residues 1-299, expressed and purified according to literature procedures41), recombinant human TCPTP (residues 1-299, expressed and purified in house), recombinant human CD45 (cytoplasmic domain, residues 484-1281, purchased from Biomol), and recombinant human LAR (soluble catalytic LAR-D1 domain, residues 1275-1613, purchased from Biomol). 5.3. X-ray Crystallographic Studies. Human recombinant PTP1B catalytic domain (residues 1-299) was prepared as described.41 The complex solution was made by mixing an excess of inhibitor dissolved in DMSO with protein (protein:inhibitor ) 1:1.5-3.0), incubating on ice for 1 h, and then filtering with 0.1 µm filters. Crystals of h-PTP1B-inhibitor complexes were obtained by vapor diffusion at 4 °C using 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0), 100250 mM MgCl2, 14-19% PEG 3350, 3 mM DTT, and 10-15 mg/ mL protein. Typically, rodlike crystals appeared overnight and continued to grow to a maximum size of 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.7 mm within 10 days. The crystals belonged to space group P3(1)21, a ) b ) 88 Å, c ) 104 Å, R ) ) 90,  ) 120°. The crystals were cryoprotected by transferring into the crystallization solution 25% glycerol. Cryoprotected crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. Diffraction data of the h-PTP1B-inhibitor complex crystals were collected by either in-house conventional X-ray generator using Raxis-IV image detectors or using synchrotron radiation with CCD at ALS (Advanced Light Source in Lawrence National Laboratory at Berkeley, CA). All data were collected at 100 K and processed with DENZO/SCALPACK.

The structures were solved by molecular replacement with the available h-PTP1B catalytic domain structure model. Cycles of model rebuilding and refinement were carried out with CNS (version 1.1, Brunger, A.T., 2001, copyright Yale University), a system for X-ray crystallography; NMR; and QUANTA (Accelrys Inc.). Inhibitor was built into the difference density after the first cycle of refinement. Water molecules were assigned according to Fo - Fc maps. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 8. 5.4. Molecular Modeling. Analogs were initially docked into the active site of the PTP1b protein structure from the X-ray complex with compound 19. As additional protein-inhibitor complex structures were determined, the binding site model was refined. Typically 1000 Monte Carlo cycles were carried out to dock each analog into the site, while also allowing selected protein residues to undergo constrained movement.42 Figures 2-4 were generated using Benchware3D (Tripos, 2006, St. Louis, MO) and rendered with the Persistance of Vision Raytracer (POV-RAY) software (www.povray.org). 5.5. Pharmacokinetic and Metabolic Stability Studies. Pharmacokinetics of PTP1B inhibitors was determined in male C57/ B6 mice (20-30 g, Taconic Farm, NY) after iv or ip administration. The compounds were prepared in DSM/PEG-200/saline solution for the iv administration or in 0.5% MC/2% TW/water as a suspension for the ip administration. Blood samples were collected over a period of 24 h, and plasma samples were harvested and stored at -80 °C until assay. The target tissues (liver and muscle) were also collected at selected time points. Tissues were homogenized in saline and the drug concentrations in the homogenates were analyzed. Quantization of PTP1B inhibitors in plasma and tissue homogenate was carried with a verified LC/MS/MS method. In vitro metabolic half-life (T1/2) and metabolic pathways were determined in liver microsomes from rats, mice, and humans using an NADPH-regenerating system consisting of MgCl2 (10 mM), glucose-6-phosphate (3.6 mM), NADP+ (1.3 mM) and glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase (0.4 units/mL) in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), UDPGA (4 mM), and substrate (1 mM for metabolic stability and 10 mM for metabolite profiling). Incubations were initiated by the addition of the NADPH-generating system and conducted for up to 30 min in a shaker-water bath at 37 °C. For the determination of in vitro metabolic half-life, aliquots of the incubation mixture were removed at 0, 10, 20, and 30 min and added to acetonitrile containing the appropriate internal standard. Following centrifugation and evaporation of the supernatant liquid, the samples were reconstituted in 20% methanol in water for analysis by LC/MS. 5.6. Studies of Compound Active Uptake into Hepatocytes. Rat primary hepatocytes (from a pool of seven or more livers) plated as a monolayer on 6-well collagen-coated plates were obtained from In Vitro Technologies, Inc. (Baltimore, MD). Incubations were based on a modification of previous methods (Kouzuki, H.; Suzuki, H.; Ito, K.; Ohashi, R.; Sugiyama, Y. Contribution of sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide to the uptake of its possible substrates into rat hepatocytes. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998, 286, 1043-1050). Cells were washed three times with 2 mL of KrebsHeinsleit buffer (KH; 142 mM NaCl, 23.8 mM Na2CO3, 4.83 mM KCl, 0.96 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 12.5 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, and 1.53 mM CaCl2, pH 7.3) and preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C. Viability was assessed by microscopic examination. Fresh KH (1 mL) prewarmed to 37 °C containing compound 32 (10 µM final concentration) with and without 100 µM verapamil in DMSO/

MeOH (0.01/0.09% v/v) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere for 5 min and terminated with the addition of 2 mL of ice-cold KH. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold KH, scraped, and homogenized with 200 µL of incubation media. Samples were extracted with acetonitrile containing internal standard, vortexed, and centrifuged at 21 000 g for 8 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was analyzed by LC/MS/MS with concentrations of compound 32 quantitated on the basis of interpolation from a six-point standard curve. Activity in the presence of verapamil, normalized for protein content (Bradford, M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding. Anal. Biochem. 1976, 72, 248-254), was reported as a percentage of activity in the absence of verapamil. Uptake of 10 µM fexofenadine was used as a positive control for OATP uptake.
