TtgR is the specific transcriptional repressor of the TtgABC efflux pump. TtgR and the TtgB efflux pump proteins possess multidrug-binding capacity, and their concerted action is responsible for the multidrug resistance phenotype of Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E. TtgR binds to a pseudo-palindromic site that overlaps the ttgR/ttgA promoters. Dimethylsulfate footprint assays reveal a close interaction between TtgR and the central region of this operator. The results of analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrate that TtgR forms stable dimers in solution, and that two dimers bind to the operator. Microcalorimetric analysis of the binding of the two TtgR dimers to the cognate operator showed biphasic behavior, and an interaction model was developed for the cooperative binding of two TtgR dimers to their target operators. The binding of the two TtgR dimers to the operator was characterized by a Hill coefficient of 1.63 ± 0.13 (kD = 18.2( ± 6.3) M, kD = 0.91( ± 0.49) M), indicating positive cooperativity. These data are in close agreement with the results of sedimentation equilibrium studies of TtgR­DNA complexes. A series of oligonucleotides were generated in which the imperfect palindrome of the TtgR operator was empirically optimized. Optimization of the palindrome did not significantly alter the binding of the initial TtgR dimer to the operator, but increased the cooperativity of binding and consequently the overall affinity. The minimal fragment for TtgR binding was a 30-mer DNA duplex, and analysis of its sequence revealed two partially overlapping inverted repeats co-existing within the large pseudo-palindrome operator. Based on the architecture of the operator, the thermodynamics of the process, and the TtgR­operator interactions we propose a model for the binding of TtgR to its target sequence.

Introduction
Pseudomonas putida strain DOT-T1E1 was isolated from waste water, and exhibits remarkable resistance to organic solvents such as toluene and other aromatic hydrocarbons. It has been shown that three resistance-nodulation-division family (RND) efflux pumps, termed TtgABC, TtgDEF and TtgGHI, are essential for this resistance. 2 The TtgDEF and TtgGHI pumps are primarily involved in the extrusion of organic solvents.2 TtgABC plays a role in

1189 ttgABC promoter, and the - 10 region of the ttgR promoter, thus controlling transcription of the efflux pump operon as well as its own expression.4 Within the protected region, a pseudo-palindromic sequence extending over 28 bp was found. However, only 65% of the nucleotides in this 28 bp sequence were related to each other in a palindromic way. This raises a question of more general interest, which concerns the biological relevance of this rather imperfect palindromic operator, which contrasts with strictly palindromic operator sequences such as the ones recognized by, for example, TetR.11,12 This paper is a detailed study of the interaction between TtgR and its operator. We have chosen a multidisciplinary approach, which comprises electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), footprinting, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). Our results suggest that the high basal expression of TtgABC is associated to the low palindromic order of the TtgR operator.

guaranteeing the intrinsic tolerance to organic solvents, but it has also been shown to extrude different antimicrobial compounds such as antibiotics (chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, streptomycin, ampicillin and cefotaxime), plant secondary products with antimicrobial properties (phloretin, quercetin, naringenin and coumestrol), biocides (triclosan), and dyes (ethidium bromide),3,4 and hence confers an multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype to P. putida DOT-T1E. A number of studies have shown that the expression of the majority of these proton-motive forcedependent transporters is transcriptionally regulated in order to avoid the deleterious side effects of an undesirable over-expression of membrane proteins.5 This is also the case for P. putida DOTT1E, and we were able to demonstrate that three repressor proteins are involved in the transcriptional control of these three efflux pumps.3,6­8 TtgABC is expressed at a certain basal level, and several antibiotics, organic compounds and flavonoids significantly enhance the expression of this efflux pump.3,4 This regulation is mediated by the transcriptional repressor TtgR,3,4,6 which belongs to the TetR family of transcriptional repressors.9 Typically, members of this family have two domains: a highly conserved Nterminal DNA-binding domain consisting of an helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, and a less conserved C-terminal domain involved in both dimerization and effector binding. 9 TtgR exerts its function through an effector-mediated derepression mechanism, which implies that in the absence of effectors the regulator is bound to its operator site, and represses transcription of the ttgABC and ttgR genes. Effector binding to the protein­DNA complex induces the dissociation of TtgR, thus enabling transcription.6 TtgR has been shown to exhibit multidrug-binding properties,4 which appears to be a characteristic feature of proteins involved in the regulation of MDR pumps.10 We recently carried out a thermodynamic study of the interaction of TtgR with structurally different effectors,4 confirming its multidrug-binding property. Interestingly, the TtgR-TtgABC system was found to be particularly efficient in sensing and extruding plant secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activities, such as different flavonoids. This ability lead to the proposition that the physiological role of the MDR system is related to resistance to plant defense metabolites, which are present in soil and rhizosphere habitats of Pseudomonas strains. As stated above, the ttgABC operon is expressed at a certain basal level3,4 which is thought to account for the intrinsic solvent and multidrug resistance of this strain. This inefficient repression has prompted studies of the interaction of TtgR with ttgABC and ttgR promoter regions. The ttgR gene and the ttgABC operon are transcribed divergently, and their respective promoters overlap.3 DNase I footprinting has shown that the TtgR operator consists of a large 36 bp fragment within the ttgR-ttgA intergenic region which overlaps the - 10 and - 35 regions of the

Results
Interactions of TtgR with its cognate operator Previous DNase I footprinting assays6 revealed that TtgR protects an almost 40 bp DNA segment within the ttgABC-ttgR intergenic region (position - 7 to - 43 of the ttgA promoter). Dimethylsulfate (DMS) footprinting experiments were conducted to study in more detail the interaction between TtgR and its operator. DMS methylates the N7 of the indol moiety of guanine bases, which are oriented towards the DNA major groove.12 Protein-mediated protection is thus indicative of guanine bases, which directly interact or are in close proximity to the protein bound in the major groove. The DMS protection footprint of the 189 bp fragment of the ttgABC-ttgR intergenic region is shown in Figure 1. Two and four guanine bases are protected on the upper and lower strand, respectively. These six protected bases are grouped around the axis of symmetry of the 28 bp pseudo-palindrome, and are highlighted by asterisks in Figure 2(a). Two of these guanine bases are located within the boundary of the symmetry axis of the pseudo-palindrome, a region characterized by a non-palindromic order. The remaining four guanine bases are found at positions that are strictly palindromic (Figure 2(a)). These results suggest that among the N7 G-contacts, the inner ones are the most intimate. Optimization of the palindrome increases affinity for TtgR Subsequent studies were designed to identify the DNA sequence requirements for high-affinity binding of TtgR. The TtgR­DNA interaction was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with a constant amount of DNA and increasing concentrations of TtgR. Initial experiments revealed

that TtgR binds with an affinity of around 1 M to a 40 bp DNA fragment (termed 40-wt in Figure 2(a)) containing the 36 bp sequence protected by the footprint. The same affinity was observed for the 189 bp fragment containing the entire intergenic region (not shown), which implies that the DNA sequence flanking the 40 bp segment has no significant impact on TtgR binding behavior. To identify DNA sequence requirements for highaffinity TtgR binding, a series of double-strand DNA oligomers were prepared and subjected to EMSA. The first group of DNA fragments had nucleotide replacements in order to increase the palindromic order of the fragment, whereas the second group corresponded to shorter versions of 40-wt (Figure 2(a)). Of all the DNA fragments tested, only the most relevant examples are listed in Figure 2(a), which also shows the relative affinity of TtgR as compared to 40-wt. TtgR binding site variants exhibiting multiple nucleotide changes DNA fragments 40-op1, 40-op2 and 40-op3 conserved the four central non-palindromic wild-type

nucleotides, and changes were introduced to create several 24 bp perfect palindromes. One or the other half-palindrome of the wild-type sequence was conserved in 40-op1 and 40-op2, whereas the remaining half-palindrome was optimized (Figure 2(a)). The 40-op3 sequence had a point change on each side of the palindrome (Figure 2(a)). Our results showed that in both 40-op1 and 40-op2, affinity decreased threefold and tenfold, respectively (Figure 2(a)), whereas the changes in 40-op3 gave rise to a modest though reproducible increase in affinity. This set of results suggests that palindromic optimization requires changes in both halfsites. Because DMS footprinting indicated that bases around the symmetry axis of the operator could interact directly with TtgR, we designed an oligonucleotide 40-op4 variant that contained two more nucleotide changes which made the central part palindromic. This resulted in an additional increase in affinity, so that the overall affinity of TtgR for this variant operator was twofold higher than for the operator with the wild-type sequence. Interestingly, when the 40-op4 sequence was analyzed, two overlapping imperfect direct repeats in each halfpalindrome were identified. The sequence of this motif was 5-(A/T)TACAT-3, in which the last two nucleotides corresponded to the beginning of the second direct repeat. Based on this observation the 40-op5 fragment was designed so that the overlapping repeats were optimized and corresponded to the 5-ATACAT-3 sequence. The affinity of TtgR for this fragment was increased by a factor of 2 compared to 40-op4, and by a factor 4 compared to the wild-type. TtgR can repress transcription more efficiently from 40-op5 than from the wild-type promoter. The sequence 40-op6 is a derivative of 40-op5 containing G-to-C transversion of four G bases protected by DMS footprints. No measurable binding of TtgR for 40-op6 was detected, which is consistent with the potential direct interaction of TtgR with these bases. The minimal operator sequence is 30 bp In another series of assays, shorter versions of the 40-wt fragment were analyzed by EMSA. No binding was observed for the double-strand oligomers called 24-wt and 28-wt (Figure 2(a) and (b)), although the latter contained the entire palindrome. However, TtgR bound to oligomer 30-wt with an affinity almost identical to that for 40-wt. This suggests that TtgR binding does not only require a specific sequence, but also a segment with a length of at least 30 bp. To establish whether TtgR bound to a half-site, derivatives of 30-wt shortened at only one end were designed (24-down, 24-up and 28-down). All fragments contained one of the two terminal 3 and 5nucleotides of the 30-wt oligomer, shown to be crucial for binding. However, no binding of TtgR was obtained to any of the fragments, as represented in Figure 2(a) by the 0 value for relative affinity.

(a) Sequences of different operator fragments and their relative affinities for TtgR as determined by EMSA. Nucleotide positions with respect to the transcription start point of the ttgABC operon are indicated. The grey shading highlights nucleotides which are in palindromic order. Nucleotides in bold correspond to nucleotide changes with respect to the wild-type sequence 40-wt. The asterisks mark guanine nucleotides, which were protected in DMS footprint experiments. Note that nucleotides marked with a C indicate protection of the G of the complementary strand. The affinities of TtgR in the right column were determined by EMSA. (b) EMSA of 40wt and 28-wt DNA fragments as examples of data in (a): radiolabelled DNA (5 nM) was incubated in the absence (-) and presence of increasing concentrations of TtgR (0.125; 0.25; 0.375; 0.62, 0.75, 1 M) and subjected to gel electrophoresis as described in Materials and Methods. These data were used to calculate the relative affinities shown above.

Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to characterize the interaction of the minimal fragment 30wt with TtgR more precisely. Figure 3 shows the titration of TtgR with 40-wt, 30-wt and 28-wt. Binding of 40-wt and 30-wt was characterized by endothermal heat changes (Figure 3 upper panel, register A and B), indicative of an entropy-driven binding reaction. The titration of TtgR with 28-wt gave rise to only small exothermic heat changes (Figure 3 upper panel, register C), which corresponded solely to the heats of dilution, demonstrating the absence of binding. The thermodynamic parameters for 40-wt and 30wt were very similar: kD = 1.57( ± 0.04) M and H = 6.33( ± 0.03) kcal/mol for 40-wt; kD = 1.23( ± 0.05) M and H = 5.95( ± 0.04) kcal/mol for 30-wt. These data show that extension of the DNA fragment from 30 bp to 40 bp did not impact significantly on the thermodynamics of interaction. However, removal of the two terminal bases of 30-wt resulted in complete loss of binding. Considered together, the data are in close agreement with the EMSA studies reported above. Two dimers of TtgR bind to their operator Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to study the TtgR­DNA interaction. Initial experiments were aimed at determining the oligomeric state of TtgR in solution. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at different TtgR concentrations. Data were analyzed in terms of the distribution of sedimentation coefficients to evaluate protein homoge-

neity and self-association. Figure 4(a) shows sedimentation velocity data for a 10 M TtgR solution. The major species (N95%) sedimented with a standard s-value of 3.4( ± 0.2) S. To determine the size of the protein species, sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out in parallel. Figure 4(b) shows the sedimentation equilibrium gradient of TtgR, which can be well accommodated by a single species with a molecular weight of 48000( ± 3000) Da. This is compatible with TtgR being a dimer, considering that the sequence-derived molecular weight of the TtgR monomer is 23854 Da. The protein concentration (in the 1 M­50 M range) had no significant impact on the sedimentation velocity and equilibrium behavior of the protein, which indicates that TtgR formed stable dimers of essentially globular shape (frictional ratio f/f0 = 1.3) 13 under the experimental conditions we used. The interaction of TtgR with the 40-wt DNA fragment was analyzed using velocity sedimentation and equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Velocity sedimentation experiments of a mixture containing a tenfold molar excess of TtgR (10 M TtgR and 1 M 40-wt) showed a biphasic behavior that gave rise to two separate peaks in the distribution of the sedimentation coefficients (Figure 5). The slower sedimentation species, characterized by a standard s-value of 3.5( ± 0.2) S, corresponded to unbound TtgR dimers as analyzed above. The faster species sedimented with a standard s-value of 7.0( ± 0.2) S and represented the nucleoprotein complex. The amount of DNA-bound protein was determined from the differences between the integrated peak

solute. This parameter was found to be higher for free DNA (experimental molecular weight=25,500 Da, standard s-value = 3.2 S), consistent with the DNA fragment being a nonglobular solute ( f/fo = 1.8). To determine the association parameters of the protein­DNA complex formation more precisely, mixtures of TtgR and DNA were subjected to sedimentation equilibrium studies. The global analysis of multiple equilibrium data sets obtained at different speeds, wavelengths and loading concentrations showed that the model that optimally accounted for the experimental data comprised the binding of 2 mol of TtgR dimer to 1 mol of DNA (not shown). However, two possible best-fit options of this model were statistically similar, with almost identical residual distributions (root-mean-square deviations (RMSD), in optical density units, of 0.00423 and 0.00438, respectively): one option in

areas of the free protein obtained in the absence and presence of DNA. The difference observed corresponded to the amount of bound protein, which was found to be two TtgR dimers per DNA fragment in the case of the experiment containing 1 M DNA, and 10 M TtgR, in which no free DNA was detected. No increase in the binding stoichiometry (nor in the sedimentation coefficient of the complex) was observed when the protein concentration was increased up to 50 M, confirming the absence of free DNA in the mixture and ruling out higher-order oligomeric forms of the nucleoprotein complex (not shown). The nucleoprotein complex first became visible at protein concentrations of 1 to 3 M of TtgR. This information was used to estimate that the apparent KA of the initial binding event was on the order of 106 M- 1, which corresponds to an apparent KD in the micromolar range. The frictional ratio ( f/fo) for the complex was found to be 1.4, which indicated that the DNA­protein complex deviated only slightly from the hydrodynamic behavior of a rigid globular

1193 was characterized by a kD of 0.91( ± 0.49) M. These data are in close agreement with the values obtained from the sedimentation equilibrium experiments, which yielded a model that also suggested cooperative binding (kD = 15.4( ± 3.5) M and kD = 1.1( ± 0.3) M). Both ITC and AUC experiments provided evidence for positively cooperative binding of TtgR to its operator. To determine the thermodynamic consequences of optimization of the palindromic order of the TtgR operator, we titrated 40-op5 with TtgR. Binding of the first TtgR dimer to 40-op5 was similar to the wild-type operator sequence (kD of 15.8( ± 5.0) M and 18.2( ± 6.3) M, respectively). However, the second dimer bound to 40-op5 with significantly higher affinity (kD = 0.18( ± 0.05) M) than in the wild-type sequence (kD = 0.91( ± 0.49) M), indicating an increase in the cooperativity of binding. The Hill coefficient for binding of TtgR to 40-op5 was increased to 1.81 ± 0.05. Given that the first TtgR

which the association constant of the two dimers was the same (kA = 1.4( ± 0.4) × 105 M- 1; dissociation constant kD = 7.1( ± 2.0) M), and a second option in which the binding affinities of the two dimers were different (kA = 6.5( ± 1.5) × 104 M- 1; kA = 9( ± 3) × 105 M- 1), and which corresponded to the dissociation constants kD = 15.4( ± 3.5) M and kD = 1.1( ± 0.3) M. The second association scheme implied that protein binding to DNA might exhibit positive cooperativity. To resolve this ambiguity in fitting the experimental data, the interaction between TtgR and 40-wt was analyzed by ITC. Increase in cooperativity following optimization of the operator palindrome Microcalorimetric data presented above involved the titration of TtgR with DNA fragments. This approach does not provide information on potential cooperativity in the binding of the protein to DNA. To verify ultracentrifugation data that suggested potential cooperative binding of TtgR to DNA, an alternative microcalorimetric approach was taken: titration of DNA with protein. The integrated peak areas for the titrations of 40-wt with TtgR showed biphasic behavior (Figure 6(a)), and attempts to analyze these data with models based on the binding of a ligand to one or two independent binding sites resulted in an unacceptable curve fit. It was thus assumed that binding of TtgR to its operator occurred in a cooperative fashion. Based on the scheme in Figure 7, an algorithm for the binding of two protein dimers to a DNA fragment was developed (see Materials and Methods). Analysis of the experimental data in Figure 6 with this model gave satisfactory curve fits, and provided useful data about the thermodynamic parameters listed in Table 1. The dissociation constant for binding of the first TtgR dimer to 40-wt was 18.2( ± 6.3) M, whereas binding of the second dimer

dimer binds to both DNA fragments with similar affinity, and considering that the second TtgR dimer binds around five times as tightly to the optimized fragment 40-op5, overall affinity of TtgR to 40-op5 was therefore significantly higher than wild-type affinity, which is in agreement with the data obtained by EMSA (Figure 2).

Discussion
The TtgR protein controls the expression of the ttgABC operon. Here we have shown using AUC that TtgR forms stable dimers in solution, and that two dimers bind to the operator (Figures 4 and 5). EMSA allowed us to define the minimal TtgR operator as a stretch of 30 nucleotides containing a 28 bp pseudo-palindrome (Figures 2 and 8(b)). A series of DNA fragments containing operator sequences with empirically optimized palindromicity were created, and the affinity of TtgR for these sequences analyzed by EMSA. TtgR bound to the 40-op5 fragment with the highest affinity, which was fourfold higher than that for the wild-type sequence 40-wt. The in vitro observations were confirmed in vivo in a series of assays that showed that TtgR repressed transcription more efficiently from optimized operators. DMS footprint studies and EMSA assays with modified operators indicated potential direct interactions of TtgR with nucleotides around the symmetry axis as well as along the conserved palindromic operator (Figure 1). Fragment 40-op5 contains two direct repeats (ATACAT) on each half-palindrome which overlapped with each other by two nucleotides (Figure 8(b)). Optimization of the direct repeats in 40-op5 also resulted in turn in the optimization of general palindromicity in the 28 bp pseudo-palindrome

1195 cholerae16 is dimeric in solution and its operator shares architectural similarities with operators recognized by QacR and TtgR. Furthermore, structural genomics research that determined the 3D structure of the CGL2612 protein17 showed this protein to be dimeric and structurally similar to QacR. Because the DNA binding site of this protein was unknown, genomic SELEX experiments were conducted; this identified a 30 bp pseudo-palindrome. Most interestingly, this sequence showed clearly overlapping, direct repeats within each halfpalindrome. Two dimers are thought to bind to this pseudo-palindrome. All four proteins, TtgR, QacR, VceR and CGL2612, share a common function since they have confirmed or proposed (in the case CGL2612) functions as transcriptional repressors of multidrug efflux pumps.

(b) Sequence fragments of the wild-type operator 40-wt and 40-op5 which contains an optimized palindrome. The 28 bp pseudo-palindrome is shown by a broken arrow. The continuous arrows indicate overlapping 18 bp palindromes. The different shades of grey highlight the nucleotides that are likely to interact with different TtgR dimers as shown in (a). The proposal is based on the analogy to QacR, for which the DNA cocrystal structure is available.15

Cooperative binding of TtgR to its operator We used microcalorimetric as well as sedimentation equilibrium analyses of operator DNA with increasing concentrations of TtgR to study the cooperativity of binding. The initial TtgR dimer was found to bind with affinities of 15.4( ± 3.5) M (AUC) and 18.2( ± 6.3) M (ITC), whereas the subsequent event was characterized by a kD of 0.91( ± 0.49) M (ITC) and 1.1( ± 0.3) M (AUC). The consistency in the data obtained by two entirely different techniques (ITC and AUC) provides evidence that TtgR binds with positive cooperativity to its operator. Optimization of the palindrome, as in 40-op5, did not significantly impact on the initial binding event of the first TtgR dimer, but increased the affinity of the second event (kD = 0.18 M), giving rise to an increase in the cooperativity of binding (Hill coefficient: 1.81 ± 0.05). This is, to our knowledge, the first report that palindrome optimization increases binding cooperativity, and it would be interesting to establish whether this is also the case for other TetR family members. Grkovic et al.18 showed that single QacR dimers are unable to bind to their operator, and proposed that binding occurs with positive cooperativity. Subsequently, the co-crystal structure of QacR15 with its operator demonstrated that the cooperativity of protein binding was mediated by DNA conformational changes, since the two QacR dimers do not interact with each other.15 It is interesting to note that the most important major groove widening reported by these authors occurred around the central bases with respect to the symmetry axis. This is consistent with our DMS footprinting data, which suggested that intimate TtgR­DNA interactions occur around the pseudo-palindrome axis. The affinity of TtgR for its operator (in the low micromolar range) is markedly lower than that of TetR for the promoter tetO (KD = 0.01 nM),15 and also significantly below the affinity measured for other TetR family members, as exemplified by KD b 100 nM for VceR,16 KD = 21 nM for HdnoR,19 and KD = 146 nM for EthR.20 The significantly high affinity of TetR for its operator seems to be related to the intrinsic toxicity of the tetA gene product,

(indicated by dotted arrows in Figure 8(b)), as well as in the optimization of two partially overlapping 18 bp palindromes (indicated by continuous arrows in Figure 8(b)) within the larger pseudo-palindrome. TtgR belongs to the TetR family of regulators, and co-crystal structures of two members of the family to their target DNA sequences are available. The TetR protein recognizes its operator as a dimer and interacts with a 16 bp palindrome with a short central spacer,14 whereas two QacR dimers recognize a complex operator that corresponds to a 28 bp pseudo-palindrome.15 The QacR protein in complex with an optimized operator15 shows that two QacR dimers bind to opposing faces of the operator, and that monomers belonging to different dimers bind to each half of a palindrome. Based on the data obtained here we propose that TtgR binds to its target operator in a fashion similar to that of QacR, with each TtgR dimer binding to one of the 18 bp palindromes (Figure 8(a)). The symmetry axes of both 18 bp palindromes are separated by 4 bp, which implies that both dimers bind to opposing faces of the DNA molecule. Therefore, we can consider the overall 28 bp pseudo-palindrome (as highlighted by the dotted arrows in Figure 8(b)) the result of the overlap of two individual and contiguous 18 bp palindromes, each of them acting as the target of TtgR. It is interesting to note that two other members of the TetR family have been reported to have QacR/TtgR binding characteristics. VceR of Vibrio

1196 which, when overproduced, has detrimental effects on cell viability.21 The relatively low affinity of TtgR for its operator may account for the intrinsic resistance of this strain to antimicrobial compounds. This might be the result of an evolutionary process that ensures a balance between affinity of TtgR for its target operator and the modulation of gene expression through steric inhibition of access of the RNA polymerase. The final result of this set of interactions is that TtgR ensures the availability of a certain basal level of TtgABC in the cell membranes to facilitate a rapid response for the extrusion of antimicrobials. Furthermore, because TtgR has high affinity for its effectors,4 it guarantees an increase in ttgABC gene expression in response to toxic chemicals.

TtgR­Operator Interactions the absence or presence of 1.5 M TtgR in 10 l reactions of DNA binding buffer supplemented with 20 g/ml poly (dI-dC) and 200 g/ml BSA. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C prior to treatment with 2 l DMS (1.5% (v/v) diluted in DNA binding buffer) for 2 min. Reactions were stopped with DMS stop solution (2.5 M sodium acetate, 1 M -mercapto-ethanol, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mg/l yeast tRNA). DNA was phenol-extracted and cleaved in 10% (v/v) piperidine at 90 °C for 30 min. Equal amounts of recovered DNA (5000 to 6000 cpm) were heated at 90 °C for 3 min and subjected to electrophoresis on 6.5% (w/v) denaturing polyacrylamide gels as described p.6 The resulting gels were analyzed with Personal FX equipment and QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). Analytical ultracentrifugation The AUC analysis of TtgR, DNA and TtgR­DNA mixtures was performed at several protein concentrations (in the range 1 M ­50 M) and two DNA concentrations (0.5 M and 1 M). All samples were prepared in 10 mM Tris­HCl, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM TCEP (pH 7.0). The sedimentation velocity runs were carried out at 40, 000 rpm and 20 °C in an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter Inc.) with a UV-VIS optics detection system, using an An60Ti rotor and 12 mm double-sector centerpieces. Sedimentation profiles were recorded every 5 min at 260 and 275 nm. The sedimentation coefficient distributions were calculated by least-squares boundary modelling of sedimentation velocity data using the c(s) method,23 as implemented in the SEDFIT program. These s-values were corrected to standard conditions (water, 20 °C, and infinite dilution24) using the SEDNTERP program25 to obtain the corresponding standard s-values (s20,w). Sedimentation equilibrium studies were conducted to determine the state of association of the individual components (TtgR and DNA) and the association properties of the TtgR­DNA mixtures. The sedimentation equilibrium runs were carried out at multiple speeds (10,000, 12,000 and 15,000 rpm) and wavelengths (250, 280 and 290 nm) with short columns (80­100 l), using the same experimental conditions and instrument as in the sedimentation velocity experiments. After the equilibrium scans a high-speed centrifugation run (40,000 rpm) was performed to estimate the corresponding baseline offsets. Weight-average buoyant molecular weights of TtgR and DNA alone were determined by fitting data to the singlespecies model using either a MATLAB program (kindly provided by Dr Allen Minton, NIH) based on the conservation of signal algorithm,26 or the HeteroAnalysis program (retrieved from the FTP site of the Analytical Ultracentrifugation Facility of the University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT. Both analyses yielded similar results. The molecular weights of protein and DNA were determined from the experimental buoyant masses using 0.734 and 0.55 as the partial specific volumes of TtgR (calculated from the amino acid composition using the SEDNTERP program25) and DNA (taken from an estimated literature value for nucleic acids; see for example Howlett and Davidson27), respectively. The HeteroAnalysis program was also used to determine the association scheme (in terms of stoichiometry and affinity) for TtgR­DNA complex formation. A second global sedimentation analysis (SEDPHAT28) gave essentially the same results.  ftp://spin6.mcb.uconn.edu

Materials and Methods
Materials TtgR was purified as described.4 Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit. Double-strand DNA fragments were obtained by annealing stoichiometric mixtures of highly purified complementary oligonucleotides in DNA-binding buffer (10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0), 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 10 mM KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT). The mixture was then heated for 5 min at 95 °C and slowly cooled to room temperature. To verify annealing, samples were analyzed on 4.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. -Galactosidase assays on the mutated operator region Site-directed mutagenesis of the plasmid-borne ttgABCttgR intergenic region fused to promoterless `lacZ was performed using the QuikChangeTM method (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) with the modifications described by Wang and Malcolm.22 Briefly, complementary mutagenic oligonucleotide primers were designed with the 40-op5 sequence alterations, as described by Stratagene. These primers were used to amplify by PCR the entire plasmid with the incorporated changes using the proof-reading Pfu-Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The introduction of site-specific alterations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. -Galactosidase assays were performed as p described.4 Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) EMSAs were carried out as described.6 The protocol described to analyze the entire ttgABC-ttgR intergenic region (189 bp) was also applied to the study of the 24 to 40 bp DNA duplexes. Dimethylsulfate footprinting The DNA probe was the radiolabeled 189 bp PCR fragment containing the ttgABC-ttgR intergenic region which was previously used for DNase I footprint studies.6 Purified labeled probe 10 nM (104 cpm) was incubated in

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) Microcalorimetric experiments were conducted at 30 °C using a VP-microcalorimeter (Microcal, Amherst, MA). Protein and DNA samples were dialyzed in DNA-binding buffer (10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0), 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 10 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). Typically, reverse titrations (DNA into TtgR) involved the injection of aliquots of 17­26 M DNA into 8­12 M TtgR dimer. Forward titrations (TtgR into DNA) consisted of the injection of 60­80 M TtgR dimer into 1.8­2.0 M DNA. All data were corrected using the heat changes arising from injection of the ligand in the syringe into the buffer. Reverse titration data were analyzed using the "One binding site model" of the MicroCal version of ORIGIN.29 The forward titration data were analyzed with a model for the cooperative binding of two ligands to a macromolecule, as described below. Development of an interaction model to analyze cooperative binding of TtgR to operator DNA The model is based on the cooperative binding of two TtgR dimers (L) to one DNA fragment (M) containing the operator (Figure 7). The model shown in Figure 7 was simplified assuming: k1 ¼ k2 ¼ k; DH1 ¼ DH2 ¼ DH k3 ¼ k4 ¼ k V DH3 ¼ DH4 ¼ DH V ; Microscopic equilibriums can be defined as follows: M þ LfML; k¼ ½ML ; DH ½M½L ½LM ; DH ½M½L ½LML ; DH V ½ML½L ½LML ; DH V ½LM½L

The explicit value of [L] makes it possible to calculate the fractions of DNA with bound TtgR, ML=LM and LML, and therefore the accumulated heat alter i injections of a calorimetric titration: Qi ¼ VC ½MT ½uML dDH1 þ uLM dDH2 þ uLML ðDH1 þ DH2 Þ Hi, enthalpy per mole of macromolecule.

The position of L to the right or the left of M corresponds to one or the other binding site of TtgR in the DNA fragment (Figure 7). A consequence of assuming k1 = k2 = k is that [ML] = [LM] at any time. The fractions of macromolecular species with bound ligand are: uML ¼ uLM ¼ ½ML kd½L ¼ ½M þ 2d½ML þ ½LML 1 þ 2dkd½L þ kdk V 2 ½L

The two kinds of fractions are related by: uML ½MT  ¼ XML ½LT ; 2duLML ½MT  ¼ XLML ½LT  and the accumulated heat after i injections of a calorimetric titration is thus:   1 Þ Qi ¼ VC ½LT  2dXML dDH þ XLML ðDH þ DH V 2 On the basis of the proposal by Yang,30 which includes correction of the heat generated by volume displaced at every injection, the heats associated with each injection can be calculated as follows:   Viny QT ðiÞ þ QT ði À 1Þ DQðiÞ ¼ QT ðiÞ À Qði À 1Þ þ VC 2 These heats divided by the number of moles TtgR added DQðiÞ represents the dependent variable, and the ratio DLT LT between the total concentrations of TtgR and DNA, , MT represents the independent variable of the fitting function.
