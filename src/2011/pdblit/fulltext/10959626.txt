Abstract The tertiary fold of the elongation factor, aEF-1, from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was determined in a high-throughput fashion using a minimal set of NMR experiments. NMR secondary structure prediction, deuterium exchange experiments and the analysis of chemical shift perturbations were combined to identify the protein fold as an alpha-beta sandwich typical of many RNA binding proteins including EF-G. Following resolution of the tertiary fold, a high resolution structure of aEF-1 was determined using heteronuclear and homonuclear NMR experiments and a semi-automated NOESY assignment strategy. Analysis of the aEF-1 structure revealed close similarity to its human analogue, eEF-1. In agreement with studies on EF-Ts and human EF-1, a functional mechanism for nucleotide exchange is proposed wherein Phe46 on an exposed loop acts as a lever to eject GDP from the associated elongation factor G-protein, aEF-1. aEF-1 was also found to bind calcium in the groove between helix 2 and strand 4. This novel feature was not observed previously and may serve a structural function related to protein stability or may play a functional role in archaeal protein translation. Abbreviations: aEF-1, archaeal translation elongation factor 1 beta; aEF-1, archaeal translation elongation factor 1 alpha; eEF-1, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 beta.

assigned functions; structural studies can significantly enhance this process through the application of highthroughput structure determination. The maturation of modern X-ray and NMR techniques has led to the development of the field of structural genomics, which promises `100 000 protein structures for the biologist' (Sali, 1998). Current estimates suggest that 85% to 90% of newly determined proteins have a previously known fold (Berman et al., 2000; Brenner and Levitt, 2000). While protein prediction methods can predict many of these structures, a significant percentage will require structure determination. Since newly discovered genes highly outnumber the current capabilities of structural

188 studies, a sensible compromise is to determine the minimal number of structures which define functional protein families. Especially efficient sampling can be attained by determining homologous structures from organisms belonging to different kingdoms. When similar, these proteins define the range of structures in the functional family. This approach was applied towards the archaeal elongation factor, aEF-1, from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. The structure of its human homologue, eEF-1, was published recently (Perez et al., 1999) and the structure of the bacterial homologue, EF-Ts, is known (Jiang et al., 1996; Kawashima et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1997). EF-1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and belongs to a class of accessory proteins involved in the translation of mRNA into proteins. These GEFs catalyze GDP/GTP exchange in translation factor G-proteins. In archaebacteria, aEF-1 releases GDP from the elongation factor, aEF-1 (Arcari et al., 1994, 1995; Masullo et al., 1994; Raimo et al., 1996). At present, there are relatively few structures of G-protein/GEF complexes: EF-Tu/EF-Ts (Kawashima et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1997), Ras/Sos1-CDC25 domain (Boriack et al., 1998), and ARF1/Gea2-Sec7 domain (Cherfils et al., 1998). While the structures of G-proteins are relatively conserved, the exchange proteins have distinct structures suggesting the possibility of different mechanisms of nucleotide exchange (for a review, see Sprang and Coleman, 1998). More structural studies are needed for better understanding of this process on the molecular level. This is especially true for archaebacteria which lie evolutionarily between bacteria and eukaryotes and for which no G-protein or GEF structures are known. For structural studies of translation factors, archaebacteria present several advantages (Dennis, 1997). Archaebacterial translation displays a mixture of eukaryotic and bacterial features and their similarity to eukaryotes makes generalization to eukaryotic processes easier than in the case of studies on bacterial proteins. At the same time, archaeal systems are simpler than eukaryotic systems and more amenable to NMR and X-ray techniques. The genomes of a number of thermophilic archaebacteria have been completely or almost completely sequenced (e.g. M. thermoautotrophicum, S. solfataricus), so that their translational factors can be identified and cloned. These thermophilic translation factors are generally smaller, yet still show high degrees of homology with the eukaryotic factors. Thus, M. thermoautotrophicum EF-1 is 23% identical to the C-terminal portion of human eEF-1, while the G-protein, M. thermoautotrophicum EF-1, is over 50% identical to human eEF-1. The translational machinery from these thermophilic organisms is more rugged and less susceptible to denaturation at temperatures typically used for NMR spectroscopy. We report here the structure of the archaeal translation elongation factor EF-1 determined by high resolution NMR spectroscopy.

Materials and methods Sample preparation Elongation factor aEF-1 from M. thermoautotrophicum (gene MTH1699) was subcloned into pET15b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) and expressed in E. coli BL21 as an oligo-histidine (His-tag) fusion protein of 109 residues. Using a standard protocol, aEF-1 was purified by heat denaturation of endogenous E. coli proteins and affinity chromatography on Ni2+ -loaded chelating sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The efficiency of the heat denaturation step was improved by removing nucleic acids by passing the cell lysate over DEAE-sephacel in 0.5 M NaCl prior to heating. Isotopically labeled protein was prepared from cells grown on minimal M9 media containing 15 N ammonium chloride and/or 13 C glucose (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratory, Andover, MA). The N-terminal His-tag was cleaved from aEF-1 by treatment for 24 h at room temperature with thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 1 unit per mg fusion protein. Benzamidine sepharose and Ni2+ -loaded chelating sepharose were used to remove thrombin and the His-tag peptide from aEF-1. NMR samples were 2.0 to 3.0 mM in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide at pH 6.3. A 50 mM MES buffer, 0.15 M NaCl and 1 mM sodium azide at pH 6.3 was used for calcium binding studies. NMR spectroscopy NMR experiments (Bax and Grzesiek, 1993) were performed at 305 K on Bruker DRX500 and Varian UNITYplus 750 MHz spectrometers. Main-chain C , N, HN and side-chain C resonances were assigned using HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH experiments (Grzesiek and Bax, 1992; Wittekind and Mueller, 1993). H resonance assignments and 3 JHN -H coupling constants were obtained from an HNHA experiment (Kuboniwa et al., 1994). As described below, these

189 assignments were sufficient for the subsequent tertiary structure determination. The remaining backbone and side-chain signal assignments were obtained from 1 H-13C HSQC, HCCHcosy, HNCO and two- and three-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear NOESY and TOCSY experiments. Nearly complete assignments were obtained for all the residues in aEF-1. In the His-tag, the nine residues following the histidines were assigned; however, no backbone amide resonances for the six histidines and first four amino acids were detected. Chemical shifts were measured relative to internal sodium 2,2-dimethyl2-silapentane-5-sulphonate (DSS) for 1 H and calculated assuming 15 N/1 H = 0.101329118 and 13 C/1 H = 0.251449530 (Wishart et al., 1995). NMR spectra were processed using GIFA (Pons et al., 1996) and XWINNMR software (Bruker Spectrospin) and analyzed with XEASY (Bartels et al., 1995). Structure calculations Structures were calculated using the ARIA module (Nilges et al., 1997) implemented in the program CNS (version 0.5) (Brunger et al., 1998). NOE restraints were obtained from 15 N- and 13 Cseparated 3D NOESY experiments using mixing times of 100 ms and from a homonuclear 2D NOESY spectrum (110 ms mixing time) of aEF-1. Distance constraints assigned by ARIA were calibrated according to NOE peak volumes. Manually assigned distance constraints were classified according to the peak intensities as strong (1.8­3.0 Å), medium (1.8­4.0 Å), and weak (1.8­5.0 Å). The  torsion angles were derived from an HNHA experiment (Kuboniwa et al., 1994). The statistics for the structure calculations are shown in Table 1. sults from NMR spectroscopy were in good agreement with computer-based secondary structure predictions. In the second step, proton­deuterium exchange experiments were used to identify secondary structure elements in the protein core. Amide protons protected from solvent exchange were identified in series of 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra acquired after solvent exchange with D2 O. Beta-strands 1 and 3 contained the largest number of slowly exchanging amide protons (residues V5, A6, I8, K9 V10, M11, V49, A50, L51, V53, M54, V55, and V56). Strands 2 and 4 showed weaker protection with a pattern of protection of every second residue (e.g. L36, D40, E42) that is characteristic of the edge of a -sheet. This information suggested the presence of a four-stranded -sheet in the protein with strands 1 and 3 in the middle and strands 2 and 4 on the edges. In the third step, the His-tag on aEF-1 was removed and 1 H-15 N correlation spectra from the tagged and untagged protein were compared (Figure 2b). A relatively small number of amide chemical shifts were affected by removal of the His-tag. The largest changes occurred in three regions: the N-terminus (in direct sequential proximity to the tag), the loop between strand 3 and helix 2 (amino acids V55 to E65) and the extreme C-terminus comprising amino acids R87, L88, and M89. Folding of the secondary structural elements to place these three regions together yielded the tertiary fold of aEF-1. Specifically, strand 1 could be identified as antiparallel to strands 3 and 4. As an indirect consequence, the direction of strand 2 was identified and the order of strands in the antiparallel -sheet was determined to be 4, 1, 3, and 2. The small sizes of the loop elements in aEF-1 meant that the orientation of helices 1 and 2 was also identified, as shown in Figure 2d. Based on the natural twist of -sheets, the -helices of aEF-1 were predicted to lie behind the -sheets. This resulted in a model of aEF-1 as a split ­­  fold which regroups many RNA binding proteins, thioredoxin, and the proregions of microbial serine proteases (Orengo et al., 1999). Comparison of the model with protein structures available at the time revealed potential similarity between aEF-1 and domain V of another elongation factor, EF-G. In the particularly favorable case of aEF-1, tertiary fold determination required less than one month of analysis following receipt of plasmid DNA expressing the protein. In the fourth step of the structure determination, approximately 400 NOEs were used to calculate initial

Results Structure determination of aEF-1 was carried out using a sequential four-step protocol. First, backbone amide and carbon resonances were assigned using standard triple resonance experiments on doubly labeled protein (Figure 1). The protein secondary structure was analyzed using proton and carbon chemical shifts and 3 JHN -H coupling constants (Spera and Bax, 1991; Wishart et al., 1991). This allowed the identification of four -strands: amino acids 3­13 (strand 1), 36­43 (strand 2), 48­58 (strand 3) and 78­88 (strand 4). Two -helices were also identified: amino acids 18­29 (1) and 64­72 (2) (Figure 2a). The re-

structures of aEF-1. 2D NOESY, 3D 15 N-NOESY and 3D 13 C-NOESY spectra were used with ARIA to calibrate and assign previously unassigned cross peaks. The set of 1854 NOE distance restraints obtained after eight rounds of calculations was checked for errors and used to calculate the final set of structures (Figure 3A). The determined structure consists of four -strands and two -helices, , as shown in Figure 3B, and confirms the predicted fold. Both helices are located on one side of the domain and the antiparallel -sheet is on another side. The residues Ile8, Val10, Val17, Leu22, Ile26, Ile30, Leu36,

Leu51, Val53, Val55, Val57, Thr64, Ala67, Leu71, Ile74, Ile80, and Val82 form the hydrophobic core of the protein. The structure contains two distinguishing features: a distinct bulge at Glu81­Thr83 in the fourth -strand and the presence of only one aromatic residue. This residue, Phe46, is located on the tip of the loop between strands 2 and 3 and points out into the solvent. The loop itself is unusually rich with hydrophobic residues (Ile44, Ala45, Phe46, Leu48). In the course of these studies, aEF-1 was found to bind Ca2+ . The chemical shift changes upon calcium binding were used to map the binding site (Figure 2c).

193 The groove between strand 4 and helix 2 contains most of the residues with the biggest chemical shift changes. Since the absolute values of these changes are relatively small, the calcium binding does not appear to significantly alter the protein structure. The calcium-binding groove is a part of a surface that contains many negatively charged residues (Asp3, Glu32, Glu35, Asp59, Glu61, Glu65, Glu68, Glu69) and no positive residues. This negatively charged surface contributes to the binding of Ca2+ . From comparative structural and sequence analysis of the EF-1 family of proteins, we can propose a mechanism for its function. Like its bacterial counterpart, EF-Ts, aEF-1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that interacts with aEF-1 (the equivalent of EFTu). Examination of the EF-Tu/EF-Ts complex shows that Phe81 plays a critical role in the exchange activity of EF-Ts. In the complex, Phe81 is inserted into a hydrophobic patch of EF-Tu. This insertion shifts and disorders the Switch I and II helices, which destabilizes GDP binding (Kawashima et al., 1996; Wang et al., 1997). Phe81 is part of a conserved TDFV sequence motif found in all EF-Ts. Similarly in aEF-1, the exposed residue, Phe46, is part of a conserved P+AFG+ motif found in archaebacterial and eucaryl EF-1 sequences. The second and last position of this motif are conserved as large hydrophobic residues, typically isoleucine or leucine, and the third position is often, but not always, alanine. Position 4 is invariably either phenylalanine or tyrosine. From our structure of aEF-1, we propose that Phe46 acts as a lever to eject GDP from the G-protein, aEF-1. A similar model has been proposed for the human protein, eEF-1, by Perez et al. (1999). It appears that across all three kingdoms ­ archaea, eubacteria, and eukaryotes ­ EF1 uses a common mechanism to effect nucleotide exchange. The calcium binding is a novel feature for nucleotide exchange factors. This metal binding seems to be quite specific since several other metals tested (e.g. Mg2+ ) did not bind to aEF-1. The calcium ions here may play a purely structural role in stabilizing the protein (for examples, see Vyas et al., 1989; Chen et al., 1999; Dzwolak et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1999). Alternatively, calcium may participate functionally by affecting either aEF-1 activity towards aEF-1 or binding to other protein factors. Future studies will test these hypotheses by site-directed mutagenesis of aEF-1 and finer mapping of the residues that interact with calcium by NMR spectroscopy.

Discussion The average protein domain size is estimated to be under 200 amino acids (Siddiqui and Barton, 1995; Burley et al., 1999; Thornton et al., 1999). Many of these domains with small loops and well-defined secondary structural elements should be amenable to rapid fold analysis by NMR. The cleavable His-tag provides a readily available tool for the chemical shift perturbation analysis that is the key to the method described here. For proteins with known ligands (e.g. a metal binding site), this analysis can be extended to include the analysis of local conformational changes induced by ligand binding. Similarly, fusion protein vectors with cleavable C-terminal extensions can be used to map residues near the protein's C-terminus. Our observation complements other NMR methods used for fold identification such as dipolar couplings (Annila et al., 1999). Identification of the protein fold can be used to generate suitable input structures for automated NOE assignment protocols (Nilges et al., 1997) and speeds the final structure determination. Since protein backbone assignments can be obtained more readily than high quality, comprehensive NOE restraints, these techniques should also allow fold analysis of proteins with solubility or stability problems. During the course of this work, the structure of the homologous domain from human EF-1 was determined by NMR spectroscopy (Perez et al., 1999). Comparison of the two structures shows close similarity with a DALI Z-score of 6.7 (Holm and Sander, 1998). Along with identical architecture, both elongation factor proteins contain a similar bulge in the fourth -strand and an exposed aromatic residue between the second and third -strands. This structural conservation in EF-1 structures is striking and suggests that EF-1 from other eukaryotes and archaebacteria are very likely to have similar structures.
