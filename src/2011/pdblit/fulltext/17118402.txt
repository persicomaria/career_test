The SH3 domain is a versatile protein interaction motif that generally recognizes proline rich sequences (PRS). Recently, it has been shown that some SH3 domains in the endocytotic pathway can bind to ubiquitin. Moreover, Phe73 in the SH3 domain has been proposed to be an important determinant of the interaction, as the SH3 domains having Tyr73, either naturally or by mutation, failed to bind. Since SH3 domains are also important in immune receptor signaling, we investigated the interactions between immunologically relevant SH3 domains and ubiquitin. We observed that some of these SH3 domains can also bind to ubiquitin. Interestingly, we found that Nck2-SH3-3 bound to ubiquitin despite its Tyr at residue 73 (Tyr56 in our actual construct), but that CD2BP1-SH3 failed to bind, even though it has Phe at an equivalent position. Through detailed NMR binding studies on SH3 domains with Phes and Tyrs at the 73 position, we found that the two types of SH3 domains exhibit mechanistic differences in ubiquitin binding. We showed that the relative contribution of each binding sub-region in both SH3 domains and ubiquitin is quite different in the two binding modes. Such results raise the possibility that the mechanistic variety of these immunologically relevant SH3 domains might contribute to their functional diversity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction The Src homology 3 domain (the SH3 domain) is an important protein interaction motif composed of about 60 amino acid residues [1­3]. It mainly binds to target motifs having proline rich sequences (PRS) with a consensus sequence PXXP. The SH3 domain is composed of beta strands with connecting loops. The two loop regions (the RT loop and the n-Src loop), along with a short 310 helix constitute the binding pocket for the canonical PXXP motif [1]. Functionally, the domain has been shown to be involved in actin cytoskeletal reorganization, endocytosis, receptor internalization and the tyrosine kinase pathways [2,4]. The domain also plays particularly important roles in T-cell activation, specifically in recruiting some of the first kinases to the T-cell receptor (TCR) [5­7]. Many proteins in the T-cell activation pathway, such as kinases themselves (Lck, Fyn), adaptor proteins, (Nck, Vav) and other interacting proteins (e.g. CD2BP1), have SH3 domains. As can be inferred from their presence in a variety of proteins, the individual SH3 domains have considerable target specificity even for the canonical PXXP motifs [1]. In addition, some SH3 domains have been shown to bind sequences without any prolines [8]. Ubiquitin has emerged as an important cellular mediator in signaling pathways. Ubiquitin attached to proteins has been implicated in regulated protein degradation, endocytosis, and protein trafficking. Ubiquitination

is also involved in immune signaling through TCR [9]. It has been shown that two activating kinases in TCR signaling, Lck and Zap70, can be degraded by ubiquitination, resulting in negative regulation of the TCR signaling. In the negative regulation process, the SH3 domain of Lck interacts with the PRS of c-Cbl, a ubiquitin ligase, which initiates the ubiquitination-dependent degradation pathway [10,11]. Recently, it has been reported that some SH3 domains involved in endocytotic pathways can interact with ubiquitin but that others cannot [12]. The binding was characterized at the molecular level showing that the ubiquitin interaction sites of those SH3 domains are largely similar to those involved in PRS binding. A Phe at 73 (F73) has been proposed as a key determinant of the interaction, as the F73Y mutation in Sla1-SH33 abrogated the binding [12,13]. In addition, several related SH3 domains with F73 showed binding, whereas others with Y73 did not [13]. Further analysis suggested that the F73 is involved in hydrophobic interaction and that the additional hydroxyl group in Tyr at the same position could cause clashes, hindering the binding [13]. These studies with ubiquitin and SH3 domains in the endocytotic pathway have also raised the possibility that similar interaction could be present in other cellular processes. As SH3 domains play critical roles in immune reaction initiation, especially in T-cell activation [5,14], we investigated whether the ubiquitin bindings are also observed for the immunologically important SH3 domains and whether a similar binding rule also holds for these cases. We observed that some of the immune-related SH3 domains do bind to ubiquitin, which surprisingly included the one with Y73. Through detailed binding

studies with NMR, we found that there are two distinct ubiquitinbinding modes, one employing F73 and the other Y73, and addressed their different characteristics. Our data suggest that the SH3 domains involved in immune signaling might exhibit specificities contributing to differential ubiquitin binding in various environments. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Enzymes for cloning genes were purchased from Takara Korea (Seoul, Korea). Primers were obtained from Bioneer (Daejun, Korea). The pET30b vector and E. coli host for expressing the cloned genes were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI, USA). Buffers, chemicals, and protease inhibitors were acquired from American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA, USA) or Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Ni-NTA agarose was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA, USA). Genes for each protein constructs were obtained from the following sources: ubiquitin (Cecile Pickart, Johns Hopkins University), Fyn and Lck-SH3 domains (Cristian Freund, FMP-Berlin, Germany), CD2BP1 (Ellis Reinherz, Dana-Faber Cancer Institute) and Nck2 (purchased from Open biosystems, Huntsville, AL). 2.2. Cloning and expression of ubiquitin and SH3 domain genes Ubiquitin, Nck2-SH3-2 and Nck2-SH3-3 constructs were amplified from the corresponding genes with PCR. The cloning of Nck2-SH3-1 was described previously [15]. Fyn, Lck, and CD2BP1-SH3 domains were directly expressed from the provided expression vectors without further sub-cloning following the instructions from the respective donors. The sequences of primers are as follows: a GATGACAAGCA TATGCAGATCTTCGTCAAGACGTTAACCGG (ubiquitin, sense), AAACTCCT CGAGACCACCTCTTAGTCTTAAGACAAGATGTAAGG (ubiquitin, antisense), GATGACAAGCAT ATGCTCAACATCCCGGC CTTCG (Nck2-SH3-2, sense), CGAAACTCCTCGAGCTCCTCCAAGAC GTAGTTGGAGG (Nck2-SH3-2, antisense), GATGACAAGCATATGGTGCTGCATGTGGTCCAGAC (Nck2-SH3-3, sense), and CGAAACTCCTCGAGACTGAGGACCACCACGTAGTTTTTG (Nck2-SH3-3, antisense). The PCR products were cloned into pET30b vector using the Nde I and Xho I restriction sites with DNA Ligation Kit (Takara Korea, Seoul, Korea). The ligated constructs were expressed in Rosetta (DE3) E. coli. The integrity of all the clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Macrogene, Seoul, Korea). Protein expression and purifications were carried out as reported for Nck2-SH3-1 [15]. For proteins with 6X-Histag (Nck2-SH3-1, 2, 3 and Lck-SH3), standard protocols by Qiagen were used for purification. The CD2BP1-SH3 domain was purified as instructed by the donor using standard GSTfusion protein protocol. Fyn-SH3 domain was purified by Q sepharose ion-exchange followed by Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography. The actual residue numbers for position 73 differ depending on the particular construct that we used and they are as follows: 55 (Nck2-SH3-

1), 53 (Nck2-SH3-2), 56 (Nck2-SH3-3), 58 (Lck-SH3), 56 (Fyn-SH3), and 58 (CD2BP1-SH3). 2.3. Ubiquitin-binding assays Ubiquitin-binding assays were performed using immobilized ubiquitin resin. Ubiquitin (Sigma, MO) was immobilized on NHS-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin using coupling protocol provided by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, NJ). The prepared ubiquitin resin was incubated with purified SH3 domain samples for 10 min at 4 °C and then washed with 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH6.5 buffer extensively. The SH3 domains that bound to ubiquitin resin were eluted by heating the washed resin in the SDS-Sample buffer. The presence of bound SH3 domains was checked with 18% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Untreated Sepharose CL-4B resin was used as negative control, as described previously [12]. 2.4. NMR spectroscopy All NMR spectroscopy was performed in 20 mM NaH2PO4 pH 6.5 buffer (5 mM DTT added in the case of Nck2-SH3-3). Assignments of Nck2-SH3-3 and ubiquitin were obtained in reference to the literature values with confirmation using standard triple resonance experiments. For binding experiments, labeled samples of about 250 M concentration were used. Typically, 64 complex points were obtained for the two dimensional HSQC spectra. For identification of binding regions, unlabeled ligand protein (2 mM) was added to the 15Nlabeled protein. Spectra taken before the addition of the ligands were used as controls. The final NMR sample had 5% D2O for lock purpose. The spectra were taken using a Varian Unity Inova 400 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance Z-gradient probe or a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer with a cryogenic probe. All NMR data were processed with nmrPipe [16] and analyzed with nmrView software [17]. This study made use of the NMR facility at Korea Basic Science Institute, which is supported by Bio-MR Research Program of the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology (E28070). 3. Results 3.1. Interactions between immune-relevant SH3 domains and ubiquitin To explore the binding phenomenon between ubiquitin and the SH3 domains involved in immune signaling, we selected six SH3 domains in the pathway (Fig. 1). Of those, two (Lck-SH3 and CD2BP1-SH3) have Phes at the 73 position, and the other four (Nck2-SH3-1, 2, 3 and Fyn-SH3) have Tyrs. We performed pulldown-assays for the six SH3 domains with immobilized ubiquitin to test the binding. The results show that Lck-SH3 and Nck2-SH3-3 bound to ubiquitin, whereas those from Fyn-SH3, CD2BP1-SH3, Nck2-SH3-1 and Nck2-SH3-2 did not (Fig. 2). This indicates that some SH3 domains in the immune signaling pathway, just as in the endocytotic pathways, have ubiquitin-binding abilities. Not all of the SH3

The SH3 domains in the endocytotic pathway (Grb2-SH3-N and Sla1-SH3-3) are shown in italics. The residues at 73 position, "F73" and "Y73", are boxed.

The actual residue numbers for the position 73 in our constructs are 55 (Nck2-SH3-1), 53 (Nck2-SH3-2), 56 (Nck2-SH3-3), 58 (Lck-SH3), 56 (Fyn-SH3), and 58 (CD2BP1-SH3). The sub-regions involved in ligand binding are indicated below the alignments.

domains, however, were able to bind to ubiquitin, suggesting the possible regulatory role of this interaction. In reference to the previous reports [12,13], the presence of interaction for Lck-SH3 and the absence of interaction for Nck2-SH3-1, Nck2-SH3-2 and Fyn-SH3 were quite expected, as they have Phes and Tyrs at the 73 position, respectively. However, it is surprising to observe that Nck2-SH3-3 bound to ubiquitin, despite its Tyr at 73, because all known ubiquitin-binding SH3 domains, thus far, have been found to have Phes at 73 [12,13]. In comparison, CD2BP1-SH3 failed to bind, even with its Phe at that position (Fig. 2). Given the report that a small number of SH3 domains with F73 lack ubiquitinbinding ability [12], the CD2BP1-SH3 result is not entirely surprising. Moreover, the absence of ubiquitin binding for CD2BP1-SH3 did not interest us much. Therefore, we concentrated on comparing Lck-SH3 and Nck2-SH3-3, with F73 and Y73 respectively, for their ubiquitin-binding mechanisms. 3.2. Mechanistic differences in ubiquitin binding for SH3 domains with F73 and Y73 Individual SH3 domains exhibit remarkably variable binding specificities and mechanisms even with the canonical PRSs. To determine

whether a similar diversity exists also in ubiquitin and immune-related SH3 domain binding, we further investigated the binding mechanisms. We chose Lck-SH3 (with F73) and Nck2-SH3-3 (with Y73) as sample systems, as these two SH3 domains showed the expected and unexpected binding, respectively. We carried out NMR experiments to study the mechanistic difference in the binding interactions for the two SH3 domains, including the binding residues/sub-regions, the differences in the type of binding interactions (i.e., hydrophobic interactions), and the biding affinities. An important prerequisite for NMR binding studies is the residuespecific assignment. We assigned our constructs of Lck-SH3 and Nck2SH3-3 using standard triple resonance experiments in reference to the published assignments [18,19]. The binding residues in each SH3 domain were identified by observing the changes following the addition of unlabeled ubiquitin to the 15N-labeled SH3 domain samples (Fig. 3). Subsets of the peaks of both SH3 domains exhibited peak shifts (Chemical Shift Perturbation: CSP), upon the addition of ubiquitin, confirming the pulldown-assay binding data (Fig. 2). The peaks with CSP were from the residues in the n-Src loop, the RT loop, and the 310 helix regions, which have been shown to be involved in binding to the canonical PRS ligands [2]. Therefore, as noted previously for the Sla1-

SH3-3 domain, the ubiquitin-binding surfaces for the Lck-SH3 and Nck2-SH3-3 domains seem to generally agree with those involved in the PRS recognition. However, a closer examination of the data yielded clues to the underlying difference between the SH3 domains with F73 (Lck-SH3) and Y73 (Nck2-SH3-3). It is apparent that the CSP profiles for the two SH3 domains, the relative CSP sizes for the perturbed subregions, are quite different (Fig. 3B and D). For Lck-SH3, the residues in the n-Src loop (Q36, S37, G38, W40, and W41) and the RT loop (H19, D20, G21, and L23) exhibited significant perturbations, whereas the residues in the 310 helix showed only marginal perturbations. In contrast, for Nck2-SH3-3, the most affected residues were in the RT loop (F11, V14, and F21) or the 310 helix (V52, K54, and V55), and the residues in the n-Src loop were much less affected. The nature of the most affected amino acid residues suggests that the two types of SH3 may employ distinct interactions for binding to ubiquitin. For Lck-SH3, the large CSP values of W40 and W41 and the absence of charged residues among the most affected residues suggest that its n-Src loop is involved in important hydrophobic interaction, in comparison to only a minor role of the n-Src loop in Nck3-SH3-3. In

contrast, the most affected residues in the RT loop of Nck2-SH3-3 (F11, V14, F21) are much more hydrophobic than those in the RT loop of Lck-SH3. Therefore, the major hydrophobic interactions between ubiquitin­SH3 domain interactions seem to come from n-Src loop for Lck-SH3 and RT loop for Nck2-SH3-3. To assess the interactions more quantitatively and address the mechanistic difference in more detail, we also measured the dissociation constants with NMR titration experiments (supplementary Fig. 1). The estimated Kd values from the titration curves were 200 and 90 M for Lck-SH3 (with F73) and Nck2SH3-3 (with Y73), respectively. These data suggest that the differential relative contributions of the individual binding sub-regions, due to their primary sequence difference, might contribute to the different binding affinities which underlie the mechanistic difference between the ubiquitin-binding SH3 domains with F73 and Y73. 3.3. Distinct ubiquitin-binding motifs for SH3 domains with F73 and Y73 To determine whether the subtle difference in the binding residue profiles also applies to the ubiquitin side, we carried out a reciprocal NMR binding experiment with unlabeled SH3 domains and the 15Nlabeled ubiquitin. The ubiquitin spectra also exhibited shifts or peak intensity decreases upon the addition of each SH3 domain (Fig. 4). Both data sets showed perturbations around residues L8, I44, and V70. These three sub-regions constitute the typical binding sites for the well-known ubiquitin-binding proteins [20­22]. However, we again observed subtle differences between the two profiles. Lck-SH3 binding showed a typical CSP profile similar to the profiles of other ubiquitinbinding domains, with the residues around I44 most affected [20,22]. This result is consistent with the observation that Sla-SH3-3 with F73 showed a close interaction with I44 of ubiquitin [13]. For Nck2-SH3-3 binding, however, the C-terminal sub-region was much more affected than the other sub-regions, with L71 and L73 having the largest CSP values. Therefore, the contributions from each binding sub-region of ubiquitin appear to be different for Lck-SH3 with F73 and Nck2-SH3-3 with Y73. 4. Discussion 4.1. Binding specificities of SH3 domains The SH3 domain is known for its binding to PRSs, generally in the context of the PXXP sequence. There are also noncanonical binding motifs that do not have this motif [8,23­25], many of which still require prolines at some positions. However, Kang et. al. also reported a motif (RKxxYxxY) that has no prolines at all [8]. Therefore, it can be stated that the SH3 domain is a versatile binding domain that can interact with various motifs. Nevertheless, SH3 domains are not promiscuous in choosing their ligands, but rather show remarkable specificities. For example, several SH3 domains in a single protein can have quite different target profiles [15,19,26]. These differences in ligand specificity seem to result from slightly different binding mechanisms, as shown for the two very close SH3 domains of Lck and Fyn [27]. It is now recognized that the ligand specificity among SH3 domains toward the PRS motif is a "norm" rather than an "exception" enabling the domain to be involved in many different cellular processes [1]. Recently, it has been shown that SH3 domains in the endocytotic pathway also can bind to ubiquitin [12]. Further studies on the binding mechanism showed that F73 in those SH3 domains is an important specificity-determining factor in ubiquitin interaction [13]. In the present study, we tested the binding specificity of various SH3 domains in immune signaling pathways for their interaction with ubiquitin. We showed that not only the SH3 domains with F73 but also one with Y73 can bind ubiquitin. In addition, we observed that CD2BP1-SH3 could not bind to ubiquitin even with F73. These data show that the immune-relevant SH3 domains can manifest a variety of ubiquitin-recognition mechanisms, as in their PRS-interactions. The

specificity is such that SH3 domains in the same Nck2 protein can show different binding behavior toward ubiquitin. 4.2. Mechanistic differences between SH3 domains with F73 and Y73 We further studied the nature of this mechanistic diversity in SH3 domain­ubiquitin interaction. We carried out NMR CSP experiments, as this method has been used widely to investigate the mechanism of ligand binding specificity [19,28,29]. The overall regions involved in ubiquitin binding turned out to be similar for the SH3 domains with F73 and Y73. The binding surfaces for both types of SH3 domain generally agree with those for the PRS, which is consistent with the results for the F73-SH3 domains in the endocytotic pathway [12,13]. However, we observed that the CSP profiles, representing the relative involvements of each sub-region, are quite different for the two types of SH3 domains, suggesting a subtle difference in their binding mechanisms. For example, the most perturbed residues in Nck2-SH3-3 were V14 in the RT loop and V52 in the 310 helix, whereas G21 in the RT loop and G38 in the n-Src loop were the most affected in Lck-SH3. Therefore, hydrophobic interactions in the RT loop and the 310 helix regions might play more important roles in the SH3 domains with Y73 than those with F73. It is likely that the roles of each subregion involved in ubiquitin binding are different, even though the

binding surfaces generally agree. Given that Nck2-SH3-3 represents the first example of an ubiquitin-binding SH3 domain with Y73, it is not surprising that Nck2-SH3-3 has a different binding mechanism. Still, it is noteworthy that the CSP profile of Nck2-SH3-3 in its interaction with ubiquitin is very similar to that in its interaction with the WRCH2 peptide containing a PRS [19]. In both cases, the RT loop and the 310 helix regions are significantly more perturbed than the n-Src loop region. Interestingly, the second SH3 domain in Nck2 with Y73, Nck2-SH3-2, which did not bind to ubiquitin, bound to the same WRCH2 ligand with a significantly different CSP profile from that of Nck2-SH3-3 [19]. Therefore, the interaction mechanisms for PRS and ubiquitin binding could be quite different according to the particular SH3 domains and might not be generalized. The binding mechanism was also addressed in terms of the binding affinities. The estimated dissociation constants were 200 M (Lck-SH3) and 90 M (Nck2-SH3-3), which are slightly larger than the reported Kd value for Sla1-SH3-3 [12], and are well within the range of those of typical ubiquitin-binding domains (Kd of 20 ~ 500 M) [30]. Interestingly, Nck2-SH3-3 (with Y73) exhibited higher affinity to ubiquitin than Lck-SH3 (with F73). These observations actually corroborate our suggestion that not only the F73 but also the individual primary structure should be considered in addressing the ubiquitin binding. The relatively weak binding affinity of the Lck-SH3 (Kd of 200 M with

F73) also suggests that some SH3 domains with F73 could have even weaker affinity toward ubiquitin depending on the actual amino acid sequences. The absence of binding for CD2BP1-SH3 (F73) shown here and other F73-SH3 domains shown before may well be other examples of sequence dependence among those SH3 domains with F73 [12]. The binding affinity results gave additional insights into the binding dynamics. The bindings for both types of SH3 domains (Nck2-SH3-3 (Y73) and Lck-SH3 (F73)) appeared to be in fast exchange regime, as most of the changes in the NMR binding experiments were manifested by peak shifts. The fast exchange is also consistent with Kd values of 90 or 200 M, assuming the generally applicable diffusion controlled association [31,32]. The fast exchange is consistent with the results for the Sla1SH3-3 case reported previously [12]. As n-Src loop regions and 310 helices contribute quite differently to the bindings of Nck2-SH3-3(Y73) and Lck-SH3 (F73) and these regions are known to be more dynamic than other regions, one could assume that dynamic properties might be playing some roles in the binding. However, the dynamic properties do not seem to be a major contributor for the difference, as the interactions for both SH3 domains are in the fast exchange regime and the n-Src loop and 310 helices are equally dynamic in the unbound SH3 domains. 4.3. Distinct binding sub-regions of ubiquitin Not only the binding regions in the SH3 domains but also the ubiquitin residues, involved in binding to the SH3 domains with F73 and Y73, seem to be different. We established that the binding surfaces in both cases again roughly agree with the previously reported hydrophobic region involved in interaction with other ubiquitinbinding proteins [20­22]. However, our data also showed that Lck-SH3 with F73 generates a quite different CSP profile from that cause by Nck2-SH3-3 with Y73, reflecting its subtly different binding mechanism. Usually, three separate sub-regions in ubiquitin are involved in target protein interaction: region I centered around L8, region II around I44, and region III around V70. Among the three sub-regions, region II around I44 is often the key in many ubiquitin­target interactions, as it forms the center of the hydrophobic pocket and the I44 mutation abolishes the binding [33­35]. Especially for ubiquitin binding, it has been shown that the I44 intimately interacts with F73 in Sla1-SH3-3 [13]. The mutation of F73 to the larger Y73 abrogated the binding, most probably due to the steric repulsion between the extra OH group and region II's hydrophobic region. Our CSP data for ubiquitin binding by Lck-SH3 is consistent with the repulsion mechanism, showing a large perturbation in region II of ubiquitin. By contrast, the CSP data for Nck2-SH3-3 showed much less perturbation in region II than in the other two sub-regions. The comparatively weak involvement of this region II in Nck2-SH3-3-ubiquitin interaction might explain its unusual ubiquitin-binding ability with its Y73. In this case, the extra OH group in tyrosine might be accommodated, since region II is not the major player in the binding. Instead, region III seems to provide the major hydrophobic interaction necessary for the binding. R72 and R74 in region III in Nck2-SH3-3 were also significantly perturbed. It should be noted that arginines can participate in hydrophobic interactions with its aliphatic side chains, as well as in ionic interactions with the guanidine group [36]. Therefore, the major hydrophobic interaction seems to come from region III with residues L71, R72, L73, and R74. 4.4. Distinct ubiquitin binding of SH3 domains and immune signaling SH3 domains play important roles in signaling processes. Based on the binding between ubiquitin and the SH3 domains in the endocytotic pathways, it has been proposed that the interactions act as switches to regulate receptor internalization and protein complex formation at the plasma membrane [12]. Moreover, it seems that ubiquitin and

ubiquitin-binding proteins employ different sub-surfaces for protein interactions in different cellular pathways [22,37]. Here we showed that the Lck-SH3 domain and the third SH3 domain of Nck2, critically involved in the immune signaling pathway, can also bind to ubiquitin, but with different contributions from their own sub-surfaces and those of ubiquitin (Fig. 5). As we also showed that a closely related SH3 domain, Fyn-SH3, cannot bind to ubiquitin, our results raise the interesting possibility that these SH3 domains could play distinct roles by differentially interacting with ubiquitin at various stages through the immune signaling pathway.
