Abstract The 134 amino acid DNase domain of colicin E9 contains a zinc-finger-like HNH motif that binds divalent transition metal ions. We have used 1D 1H and 2D 1H­15N NMR methods to characterise the binding of Co2q, Ni2q and Zn2q to this protein. Data for the Co2q-substituted and Ni2q-substituted proteins show that the metal ion is coordinated by three histidine residues; and the NMR characteristics of the Ni2qsubstituted protein show that two of the histidines are coordinated through their N´2 atoms and one via its Nd1. Furthermore, the NMR spectrum of the Ni2q-substituted protein is perturbed by the presence of phosphate, consistent with an X-ray structure showing that phosphate is coordinated to bound Ni2q, and by a change in pH, consistent with an ionisable group at the metal centre with a pKa of 7.9. Binding of an inhibitor protein to the DNase does not perturb the resonances of the metal site, suggesting there is no substantial conformation change of the DNase HNH motif on inhibitor binding. 1H­15N NMR data for the Zn2q-substituted DNase show that this protein, like the metal-free DNase, exists as two conformers with different 1H­15N correlation NMR spectra, and that the binding of Zn2q does not significantly perturb the spectra, and hence structures, of these conformers beyond the HNH motif region. q2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

1. Introduction Colicins are toxins produced by the Enterobacteriaceae during times of nutrient or environmental stress as a means of reducing competition from related strains ([1,2] and Refs. therein). They can be subdivided into two major classes, pore-forming colicins and nuclease colicins (E2­E9). Cell killing by the nuclease colicins involves three steps: binding to the extracellular receptor for vitamin B12, BtuB; translocation across the periplasm and entry into the cytoplasm; and nuclease digestion of RNA [3­5] or DNA [6­8]. Colicins E2, E7, E8 and E9 hydrolyse DNA. The DNase domains of these proteins have a high sequence identity with each other [2] and they also share sequence identity with a family of prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes known as HNH endonucleases [9,10]. The HNH endonucleases are members of a larger functional group, known as homing endonucleases, which promote the homing of genetic elements into allelic intronless or inteinless sites [9­11]. We are studying the E

colicin DNases in a multi-disciplinary study aimed at uncovering structural and mechanistic features of their action [2,12]: primarily, how the toxin is taken in by target cells; why producing cells are immune to the toxin they produce; and what the role is of metal ions in their function. In pursuit of these aims we have determined the X-ray structure of the complex formed between the DNase domain of colicin E9 and its inhibitor protein Im9 [13], which has revealed that a metal ion is present at the probable active site of the enzyme (Fig. 1), and have studied its metal-dependent nuclease action [15,16]. The metal ion in the E9 DNase-Im9 complex is Ni2q [13], while in the related E7 DNase-Im7 complex, prepared by a different procedure, the metal ion is Zn2q [17]. The Ni2q of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex is coordinated by three histidine residues and a phosphate ion (Fig. 1) located at the putative DNA binding site [13]. This structure reveals the underlying features of the HNH motif (xExHHIxPx2-4Gx5-6NLx3TPx2-3Hx3H [9,10]) which comprise the core of the E9 DNase active site. This motif spans 33 amino acids, with 11 residues being reasonably well conserved in 23 eukaryotic and prokaryotic sequences, which wrap around the bound metal ion

H and 15N NMR spectra were acquired with a Varian Unity Inova 600 spectrometer. Proton chemical shifts were measured from internal dioxane at 3.77 ppm. 1D 1H NMR spectra run over a spectral window of 300 000 Hz were acquired using the Super-WEFT pulse sequence [21], or with presaturation of the residual solvent resonance. t values of 20­40 ms, acquisition times of 45­55 ms, repetition rates of 65­95 ms and line-broadening functions of 10­20 Hz were used in the Super-WEFT experiments. The saturation period and acquisition times for the presaturation experiments were 700 and 128 ms, respectively. 1H­15N HSQC spectra [22] were acquired as previously described [23].

Fig. 1. Schematic view of the metal ion binding site of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank accession code 1bxi) [13]. The binding site for the Ni2q ion is located between an a-helix and an antiparallel b-sheet, which is a characteristic motif of Zn2q-finger proteins. Residues 131­134 do not have strong density in the X-ray electron density map but the coordination of His131 is clear (see text). The figure was constructed with MolMol [14].

3. Results and discussion 3.1. What are the metal ligands of the E9 DNase? H NMR spectroscopy allows histidine residues coordinated to paramagnetic ions to be investigated through their exchangeable ring NH resonances (Fig. 2) ([24] and Refs. therein). Because the histidine is bound to a paramagnetic ion its nuclei experience scalar interactions with the unpaired electron(s) that result in their resonances being shifted sub1

and its coordinated phosphate [13]. By contrast, the Zn2q of the E7 DNase-Im7 complex is coordinated by three histidine residues and water even though phosphate was present in the crystallising solution [17]. A complication with the E9 DNase-Im9 complex X-ray structure was that residues at the C-terminus, including a proposed metal ion ligand, did not show up well in the electron density map. Therefore, we have sought to investigate metal ion binding to the E9 DNase by NMR spectroscopy. A previous NMR study has shown that Ni2q binds sufficiently tightly to the protein to remain with it after purification of the protein through a Ni2q-affinity column [18] and therefore we have used Ni2q as a paramagnetic probe of the site. Results from this study are reported in the present paper, together with NMR data for the Co2qsubstituted and Zn2q-substituted proteins. The questions addressed by this work are: 1. What are the metal ligands of the E9 DNase? 2. Does metal binding cause a conformational change of the E9 DNase? 3. Does Im9 binding to the E9 DNase affect the metal site? 4. Does NMR provide any insights into the role of the bound metal ion? 2. Materials and methods E9 DNase was expressed in Escherichia coli, either unlabelled or uniformly labelled with 15N, purified and assayed for biological activity as previously described [19,20]. After elution from the Ni2q-affinity column with 6 M guanidinePHCl, the eluant was dialysed against 1 mM EDTA and 0.2 M NaCl, followed by dialysis against 0.2 M NaCl and then dialysed against water, lyophilised and resuspended in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.2. Protein concentrations for NMR were 1­2 mM.

Fig. 2. The coordination of histidine to nickel through (I) its N´2 and (II) its Nd1 nitrogens. Interatomic distances between ring protons and the metal centre are indicated by broken lines. Distances between the paramagnetic ° nickel and the boxed protons are short enough (;3.3 A) to prevent the corresponding resonances from being observed in 1H NMR spectra at 600 MHz due to significant paramagnetic broadening. However, the circled pro° ton (at 5.28 A from the paramagnetic Ni2q) is far enough away from the metal to be detectable in the hyperfine shifted region. Similar distances between the exchangeable ring NH protons and the nickel ion also allow their resonances to be observed in the hyperfine shifted region of 1H NMR spectra from samples in H2O at 600 MHz. Thus, coordination through the N´2 of histidine (I) is expected to result in one relatively sharp exchangeable hyperfine shifted 1H resonance, whereas coordination through the Nd1 of histidine (II) would result in two relatively sharp hyperfine shifted 1H resonances -- one exchangeable, and one non-exchangeable. The N­Ni bond lengths were taken from the X-ray structure of the E9 DNase-Im9 complex [13].

stantially away from the diamagnetic region. Therefore, it is concluded that, if a 1H resonance is exchangeable with 2H and experiences a large hyperfine shift, it must arise from a coordinated residue containing an NH. This approach was first employed to study class I cytochromes c [25], but it was developed into a generally applicable method for characterisation of non-heme metal centres through a series of studies of Co2q-substituted carbonic anhydrase [24,26]. These showed that histidine coordination through its Nd1 could be distinguished from coordination through its N´2, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Subsequent NMR studies of Ni2q-substituted carbonic anhydrase have also allowed the histidine coordination to be determined [27]. This whole approach is dependent upon the scalar contributions to chemical shifts outweighing any dipolar terms arising from the paramagnetism, something which is impossible to demonstrate quantitatively without knowledge of the magnetic susceptibility tensor [24]. However, for Ni(II) bound to four or five ligands, dipolar shifts are expected to be less than scalar shifts [24,28] as shown by the calculations reported by Donaire et al. [29] for Ni(II)substituted azurin. The situation is more complex for Co(II). In tetrahedral sites, such as that seen for the DNase (Fig. 1), the magnetic anisotropy of Co(II) is likely to be relatively small and scalar terms will therefore dominate hyperfine shifts [26]. However, for distorted sites the magnetic anisotropy could increase so that sizable dipolar shifts are observed [29]. The high-frequency region of the 1H NMR spectrum of Co2q-containing E9 DNase contains two exchangeable signals with chemical shifts of 75.7 and 66.2 ppm (Fig. 3); a value indicative of a scalar interaction. From the apparent intensities of the exchangeable signals it is likely that the signal at 75.7 ppm is from two overlapping resonances. This signal does not split into two with variation of temperature over the range 278­303 K, so if it comes from two NH protons

they have the same Curie-type temperature dependence. There appear to be exchangeable resonances in the 10­20 ppm region but their chemical shifts are not large enough to allow them to be unambiguously assigned to resonances having scalar shifts. Thus, there is evidence for Co2q-containing E9 DNase having strongly shifted resonances from three

The resonance at 51.3 ppm in spectra A, B and D is assigned to Hd2 of His102.

exchangeable hydrogens consistent with three histidine ligands to the Co2q. The corresponding spectra of Ni2q-containing DNase show three resolved exchangeable resonances which have chemical shifts greater than 20 ppm (Fig. 4(A) and (B)), providing an unambiguous indicator for three coordinated resonances. Furthermore, it is possible to state that one of the histidines is coordinated via its Nd1 and the other two through their N´2 atoms from the observation of a single nonexchangeable CH resonance at 51.3 ppm. Though the linewidth of one of the shifted NH resonances is similar to that of the CH resonance, and both are sharper than those of the

other two NH resonances (Fig. 4(A)), it is not possible to make a definite assignment for them as the NH hydrogens of Nd1 and N´2 coordinated histidines are about the same distance from the Ni2q (Fig. 2). The X-ray structure [13] shows that His102 is coordinated through Nd1 and His127 through its N´2. His131, which has only weak electron density in the X-ray study, must also be coordinated through its N´2 (Fig. 1). NMR spectra of Ni2q-containing DNase also indicate that the environment of the metal ion is affected by the presence of phosphate (Fig. 4(A) and (C)). This is consistent with the X-ray structure which shows phosphate coordinated to

Unboxed, labelled residues represent backbone NH resonances of residues that exist in two conformations in Zn2q-containing E9 DNase. For clarity, not all doubled residues in the DNase are labelled. Boxed, labelled residues indicate resonances that are significantly perturbed (average chemical shift perturbations of 0.49 ppm (1H) and 2.5 ppm (15N)) on the addition of Zn2q to E9 DNase. The latter are all located within ° 10.5 A of the metal ion binding site in the X-ray structure [13]. The positions of the significantly perturbed resonances are identified in each spectrum by red (metal-free DNase) and blue (Zn2q-containing DNase) boxed labels, respectively. Gly31 and Leu101 are observed to be both significantly perturbed and conformationally heterogeneous after the addition of Zn2q.

the metal ion (Fig. 1), but it does not unambiguously demonstrate that phosphate is bound to the Ni2q. 3.2. Does metal binding cause a conformational change of the E9 DNase? Zn2q binding to apo-DNase perturbs its intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and UV CD spectra, consistent with a small conformation change [16]. Since crystals of the metal-free DNase have not been obtained we have initiated a study of the Zn2q-induced conformation change by heteronuclear NMR. Our previous work has led to resonance assignments for the 1H­15N HSQC spectra of the apo-DNase [23,30]. That work showed that the DNase has two conformers which interchange with rate constants of 1.05­1.6 sy1 at 288 K. The 1 H­15N HSQC spectrum of the Zn2q-containing DNase shows that this also has two conformers (Fig. 5). Many of the 1H­15N HSQC resonances are not affected by the presence of Zn2q, though some from nuclei close to the binding site are (Fig. 5). In particular, the backbone NH resonances of residues 31, 101­103, 120, 122, 126­130, 132 and 133 are affected by the presence of Zn2q. These residues encompass the metal ion binding site (Fig. 2). It is clear from the NMR analysis to date that the enzyme does not undergo an extensive conformational change on binding Zn2q but a full structural description requires NOE analyses, which are underway. 3.3. Does Im9 binding to the E9 DNase affect the metal site? The X-ray structure of the Im9- E9 DNase complex reveals that Im9 binds to the DNase at a site remote from the putative active site, and that it may inhibit the enzyme by sterically interfering with DNA binding to the enzyme [13]. Since the structure of a colicin DNase without a bound inhibitor protein has not been determined, it is uncertain whether the inhibitor induces a conformation change in the DNase by binding to it and that it is this conformation change that results in the inhibition [23]. Whether inhibitor binding to the DNase affects its metal ion binding site might be an indication of such an induced conformational change but as Fig. 4(A) and (D)) reveals, Im9 binding to the Ni2q-containing E9 DNase does not perturb the chemical shifts of the histidine ligand resonances. This implies that the Ni2q binding site, which is at the centre of the putative DNA binding site [13], is unaffected by Im9 binding, consistent with Im9 binding not causing a significant conformational change to the DNA binding site. 3.4. What is the role of the bound metal ion in the E9 DNase function? The physiologically relevant transition metal ion is most probably Zn2q, which binds with a higher affinity than either Co2q or Ni2q [16]. The function of the bound transition metal ion appears to be structural [16] though its coordina-

tion by three histidines and phosphate or water suggests it should have a catalytic role. However, a transition metal ion is not essential for its non-specific activity against plasmid DNA [16]. Some homing endonucleases recognise DNA sequences of 15­40 base pairs [11] but a similar specificity sequence for the E9 has not been identified. There is the possibility that the transition metal ion is involved in DNA binding but not catalysis, and hence would affect Km but not kcat [16]. Since investigation of the chemical properties of the metal site should help determine its function, we have embarked on a spectroscopic examination. Resonances of the histidine residues bound to the E9 DNase Ni2q are pH dependent (Fig. 6). As pH is increased

resonances are shifted by a single proton ionisation with a pKa of 7.9, and the NH resonance reduces in intensity, possibly as a result of enhanced chemical exchange of the NH proton, and is no longer visible by pH 7.3. Candidate groups responsible for the ionisation close to the Ni2q centre are a coordinated histidine ionising to a histidinate, which would lead to the loss of one NH signal, Glu100, His103 and the bound phosphate ion. We believe it is unlikely that the ionising group is a bound histidine because the imidazolate pKa values for groups bound to divalent metal ions are substantially higher than 7.9, at ;12 [31], and such ionisations for histidine bound to low-spin ferric ions cause much larger chemical shift changes than those observed in Fig. 6 as a result of changes in the distribution of the unpaired electrons caused by placing a negative charge on a metal ligand [32]. The possibility that there is water bound to the Ni2q that ionises to hydroxide cannot be firmly ruled out. Since there is weak electron density for part of the metal ion binding site in the E9 DNase-Im9 structure [13] a coordinated water might not be visible, and the experiments reported in this paper do not address the issue of whether water is bound or not. It is notable that, in the E7 DNase-Im7 structure, water coordinated to the Zn2q, rather than phosphate [17]. Since DNA hydrolysis is likely to involve acid­base activity from functional groups within the binding site, the observation of the metal-linked pKa is potentially significant. The firm identification of the ionising group will be an important step in defining the reaction mechanism and mutant proteins are currently being prepared to help with this.
