Bovine pancreatic phospholipase A, covalently inhibited by p-bromo-phenacyl-bromide was crystallized from 50% (v/v) 2-methyl-2.4-pentanediol. The space group was P3,21 with cell dimensions a = h = 46.73 A and c = 102.5'A (1 A = 0.1 nm). Diffraction data were collected by oscillation photography from one single crystal of dimensions 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm. The crystal structure was determined to a resolution of 2.5 A by crystallographic refinement of a starting model, which consisted of native bovine pancreat'ic phospholipase A, positioned and oriented in the P3,21 cell as in the bovine prophospholipase A,. The crystallographic R-factor decreased from 0.378 to 0.197 after 70 refinement cycles. For the greater part the three-dimensional structure was verv similar to that of natjive phospholipase. The inhibitor group shows up clearly. However, as-in solution, there is no calcium ion bound any more in the active site, and this causes a significant conformational change in the loop from residue 59 to 73. This loop is remote from the calcium binding site. Interestingly, this is the same loop that also shows different conformations in other phospholipase A, molecules. The inhibitor molecule has hydrophobic interactions with Phe5 and Cys45. Rational design of specific and potent inhibitors of phospholipase A, catalysis is discussed on the basis of the present three-dimensional structure.

1. Introduction
Phospholipase A, catalyses the hydrolysis of the I-acylester bond of 3-sn-glycerophospholipids. The enzyme occurs both extracellularly and within cells. Extracellular phospholipases A, have been isolated in abundance from mammalian pancreas and from snake and bee venoms (for reviews, see Verheij et al., 1981; Volwerk & de Haas, 1982; Dennis, 1983). They need calcium ions for their activity (Pieterson rt al., 1974n; Wells, 1973) and can be inactivated by p-bromo-phenacyl-bromide (Volwerk et aZ., 1974; Halpert et al.; 1976). The pancreatic phospholipase A, is synthesized as a pro-enzyme. Upon secretion into the gastro-intestinal tract this pro-enzyme is activated by trypsin, which cleaves off the seven N-terminal ammo acid residues. The catalytic properties of precursor and enzyme, with respect to monomeric substrates, are quite similar. However, t Present address: Hoffmann-La Roche.

when substrate is present as an aggregate, such as micelles, there is a large increase in enzymatic activity of the mature enzyme, but, not of its zymogen (Pieterson et al., 1974b). Threedimensional structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography for phospholipases A, from bovine pancreas (Dijkstra et al., 1981a), porcine pancreas (Dijkstra et al., 1983a) and (`rotalus atroz venom (Hrunie et al., 1985). In addition, the threedimensional structure of bovine pancreatic prophospholipase A, is known (Dijkstra et al., 1982). The extracellular phospholipases A, show a high degree of sequence homology and also their threedimensional structures are very similar (Renetseder ef al., 1985). The intracellular phospholipases on the other hand are far less easy to isolate and purify, because they occur in minimal amounts and they are often bound to membranes (for a review, see van den Hosch, 1980). Like the extracellular phospholipases they have been shown to be calcium dependent, and, in one case at least, to be inactivated by p-bromo-phenacyl-bromide in the same manner as

the extracellular ones (de Wint'er et nl.. 1982). These intracellular phospholipases A, have been implicated t,o play a role in a variet.y of physiologically important cellular responses, such as inflammation and blood platelet' aggregation. These processes appear to be initiated by the release of arachidonir acid from cell membranes due to the stimulation of intracellular phospholipasrs A, (Lewis B Au&n, 1981). Recently, a phospholipase AZ has been isolated from sterile inflammatory peritoneal exudates. whirh shows, in its first) 39 S-terminal amino acid residues, an appreciable sequence homology w&h pancreat~ic and snake venom phospholipases X, (Forst rt al., 1986; the rrmainder of the sequence was not published). This indicates that t*here exists similaritg between t'hc pancreatic and snake venom phospholipasesA, and at least one of the intracellular ones. Ikcause of the crucial role of intracellular phospholipases A,. there is a great interest in specific inhibitors for phospholipase A, in order t'o prevent, or suppress the consequences of phospholipase A, action in certain pathological cases of crhronic inflammation, such as rheumatoid artjhritis and asthma. To this end a clear understanding of the interaction of phospholipases-4, with substrates and inhibitors is required. As a first step towards this understanding we determined the X-ray structure of a pancreatic phospholipase A, cuovalently inhibited by p-bromo-phenacy-bromide. This allowed us t,o define part of t,he hydrophobic. hinding site for monomeric phospholipids.

and Methods

(a) Oystallization

AZ. covalrntly modified with p-bromo-phenacyl-bromide (Volwerk it al.. 1974). was generously provided by Professor de Haasand co-workers (Utrecht). The protein was set t,o crystallize under standard conditions for bovine phospholipase A,: freeze dried protein was dissolved in 50 mM-Tris. HC'I (pH 7.2). 5 mm-CaCl, to a concent,ration of 10 to 15 mg/ml (Z 1 mM). Portions (50 ~1) of this solution were frozen in small glass tubes at -20°C. %-Met'hyl-2.4. pentanediol (Fluka) (50 ~1) was layered on top of the frozen solution and the tubes were set aside for crystallization at room temperature. Tiny crystals grew after several months. The present study was undertaken with one cr.ystal (0.2 mm x 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm) taken from these experiments after about, 6 yrars. The space group is 1'3,21 with cell dimensions a = h = 46.73 A. c = 102.5 A (I A = 0.1 nm).

Bovine pancreatic phospholipase

A 3-dimensional X-ray diffraction data set was collected on an Enraf-Nonius rotation camera (Arndt & Wonacott. 1977) with graphite monochromatized CuKcc radiation from an Elliott UX-20 rotating anode generator. The crystal-to-film distance was 75 mm. The crystal was rotated about' the c*-axis with a total scan range of 0.0" to 60.2". rorresponding to roughly 2 asymmetric units of reciprocal space for space group 1'3,21.

The cell dimensions of this crystal were very similar t'o t,hose of bovine pancreatic pro-phospholipase A, (Dijkstra et al., 1982) (for a comparison of the two crystal forms see Table 2); also the diffraction pattern was similar to that of the pro-phospholipasr A, (R = 0.27; see Table 2). Because part of the pro-phospholipase A, structure is disordered. we used as the starting model for the refinement the structure of the refined bovine phospholipase A2 (Dijkstra et al., 1981a) without solvent, positioned as in the bovine pro-phospholipaw A, crystals (Dijkstra et al., 1982). The

starting crystallographic R-factor for this model was 0.378. The positioning was refined by a "manual" rigid-body R-factor search. which resulted in a slight improvement of the R index to 0.364. The corresponding &m-weighted 2F,-E', map was clear and unambiguous for the greater part. However, the region of residues 63 to 68 was ill defined, as were the side-chains of residues 31, 34 and 113 t80 115. Moreover, the covalently bound inhibit'or, which we had hoped to see linked to the active site His48, showed up only very weakly and was not clearly interpretable. A comparable observation was made in the rather noisy F, -I', map. where density at a level of about 20 above average was found near the expected location of the inhibitor, but this density was not readily interpretable either. Therefore, we decided to refine the initial model. leaving out, in the first' round, the unclear regions as well as the side-chain of His48 and the Ca ion. In the maps calculated after this

1X4 first round, density for the omitted sides-chain of His48 showed up clearly, as well as density for residues 31, 34 and 113 to 115. In contrast, there was no density for the Ca ion. This was to bc expected because the modified enzyme in solution does not bind Ca2+ any more (Volwerk ef nl.. 1974). I, Extending from the His48 side-chain at the Ndl atom. density was observed at a level of 20 above average in the B',- fi', and 2fii--k', maps, which could now easily be interpreted as tfhe modifying group. The densit)y for the loop comprising residues 63 tjo 67 was still ill defined aft,er t,his refinement, Cole. Although during the refinement several d'ifferent, interpretations. for this loop were tried. none of them gave a satisfactory result: the densit) for t,his loop remained low and discontinuous. A tot,al of 70 refinement cycles was performed and 65 water molecules were included in the model.

The overall r.m.s.t error in bhe co-ordinates has been estimated to br about 0.30 a from a a,-plot (Read, 1986), which is in good agreement with other structures refined at a similar resolution (see e.g. Deisenhofer. 19Sl), for which the r.m.s. error for well-defined atoms was estimated to be 0.25 to 0.30 !I.

the other interactions of the inhibitor with the enzyme are hydrophobic ones. Table 4 lists all protein atoms within 4.0 ,h from each atom of the inhibitor. From Figure 3 and this Table it is clear that the active site is very easily accessible to the reagent. While the hydrophobic part of the active site has barely changed, the conformation of the calcium binding loop (residues 28 to 33) does show obvious changes. Although at first' sight t'he p-bromophenacyl group does not seem to interfere with the calcium binding site and enough space is available t)o accommodate the calcium ion, nevertheless this ion is absent'. The carbonyl oxygen atoms of residues 28, 30 and 32, which were ligands to the calcium, have moved apart thereby giving a different conformation to, especially, the mainside-chain atoms of Leu31. The chain and conformation of the other calcium ligand, Asp49, has remained virtually the same. Instead of binding to calcium, this Asp side-chain makes a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr69. This interaction has become possible because of an appreciable conformational change of the entire Tyr residue, by which the Tyr side-chain swings towards

the active site (Fig. 4). The hydroxyl group of this side-chain has moved about 4 A in the direction of the active site. Not only does the side-chain of this Tyr have a different conformation, also the mainchain atoms move about 1.4 A in the direction of the active site, pulling with them residues 68, 70, 71 and 72. This results in a quite different position for Pro68. Residues 64 to 67 have a very low density, and no unambiguous position could be assigned bo these residues. This is also clear from Figure 5 which shows that these residues have a very high temperature factor.

4. Discussion
We have described the structure determination of a phospholipase A, covalently modified at the active site histidine. Surprisingly, the conformation of the active site residues is identical with that in the native enzyme. while there are some drastic conformational differences elsewhere in the molecule. The fact that the conformation of the active site residues has not changed illustrates that the p-bromo-phenacyl group fits well in the active site. The inhibitor makes several hydrophobic

Superimposed, in a dotted sphere representation, are the calcium ion and its 2 water ligands. in a position equivalent to that in t,he native structure. (In the inhibited structure no calcium ion is bound any more.) it is obvious that the contacts made by the `. upper " water molecule with the aromatic ring of the covalently bound inhibitor are too short.

site consists of a hydrophobic pocket, formed by the side-chains of residues Phe5, Ile9, Phe22, Ala102, Ala103, Phe106 and the disulphide bridge between Cys29 and Cvs45. Tndeed, the p-bromo-phenacyl group binds m this hydrophobic pocket, without changing the conformation of any of these hydrophobic side-chains. This structure identifies Phe5 and Cys45 unambiguously as amino acid residues contributing to the hydrophobic binding pocket of the active centre: which we had predicted earlier. It also demonstrates the conformational freedom of the side-chain of Tyr69. At this time it is only possible to speculate on the way this residue will act in case a true substrate binds in the active site, but it is conceivable that the Tyr69 side-chain will interact with the phosphate moiety of the substrate. Although the p-bromo-phenacyl group does not resemble the true substrates very much, this threedimensional structure of the bound inhibitor might nevertheless be a good starting point for a rational design of specifics and potent inhibitors. A first goal could be to improve the specificit'y and affinity for site by adding a the phospholipase A, active oarbonyl group to t'he inhibitor, such that it could bind to calcium instead of pushing it out'. Alternatively. it could be envisaged, that adding an amino group, which would sit at the calcium position and interact with Asp49 and the carbonyl oxygens in the calcium binding loop, would enhance the affinity of the inhibitor for the enzyme. An important question remaining is the cause of the flexibilit,y/disorder of residues 64 to 67. Tn t'he native bovine phospholipase A, the conformation of this 64 to 67 loop is stabilized by hydrogen bond interactions between the side-chains of Asp66 and Asn71 (H-bond distance 2.9 A), and between the Asn67 side-chain and the Oy atom of Thr70 (H-bond structure residues dist,ance 3.3 a). In th e inhibited 68 to 72 have moved in the direction of t'he active site, and residues 64 to 67 have become invisible in the electron density maps. We therefore suggest that the shift of residues 70 and 71, which is about

1 to 2 A, is too large to maintain the abovementioned hydrogen bonds. This causes the destabilization of the conformation of the 64 to 67 loop as found in the native enzyme. In other phospholipases A, conformational diff`erences or flexibility/disorder have also been found in this part of the molecule. In porcine phospholipase the conformation of the loop from residue 63 to 72 was found to be well defined, but substantially different from that in the bovine enzyme. This different conformation has been attributed to one single amino acid substitution (Val63 t,o Phe63: Dijkstra et al.. 19836). Tn the bovine pro-phospholipase, as well as in an N-terminally modified bovine phospholipase A, (Dijkstra et al., 1984), an even more ext,ensive flexibility than in the present structure has been demonstrated. In these structures the loop from residues 63 to 72 was found to be flexible, both in solution and crystal structure. Thus. this part of the molecule can easily adopt several different conformations, which apparently barely differ in energy. In the pro-phospholipase and t,he Kterminalll modified phospholipase A, the flexibility of the 63 to 72 loop has been correlated with a diminished affinity towards lipid aggregates, like micelles. In the present structure only residues 64 to 67 are not visible in the electron density maps, and are therefore disordered or flexible. Because the inhibited enzyme shows an unaltered affinity for aggregated substrates (Pieterson et al.. 39746) residues 64 to 67 are probably not too important for the binding of lipid aggregates. In this paper we have described the refined threedimensional structure of covalently inhibited phospholipase A, from bovine pancreas. This structure has allowed us to define part of the hydrophobic binding sit'e for monomeric substrates. Tt also provides us with a starting point for the continuation of our work on phospholipase A, towards a rational design of potent and specific inhibitors for this enzvme. In addition. we aim at, the structure determination of a (non-covalent)

enzyme-inhibitor complex, in order t'o obtain more insight into the catalytic mechanism of phospholipase A,. \\:r thank Professor C:.
