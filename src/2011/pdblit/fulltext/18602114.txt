High-resolution structures of variant Zif268­DNA complexes: implications for understanding zinc finger­DNA recognition
Monicia Elrod-Erickson1, Timothy E Benson1 and Carl O Pabo1,2*
Background: Zinc fingers of the Cys2­His2 class comprise one of the largest families of eukaryotic DNA-binding motifs and recognize a diverse set of DNA sequences. These proteins have a relatively simple modular structure and key base contacts are typically made by a few residues from each finger. These features make the zinc finger motif an attractive system for designing novel DNA-binding proteins and for exploring fundamental principles of protein­DNA recognition. Results: Here we report the X-ray crystal structures of zinc finger­DNA complexes involving three variants of Zif268, with multiple changes in the recognition helix of finger one. We describe the structure of each of these three-finger peptides bound to its corresponding target site. To help elucidate the differential basis for site-specific recognition, the structures of four other complexes containing various combinations of these peptides with alternative binding sites have also been determined. Conclusions: The protein­DNA contacts observed in these complexes reveal the basis for the specificity demonstrated by these Zif268 variants. Many, but not all, of the contacts can be rationalized in terms of a recognition code, but the predictive value of such a code is limited. The structures illustrate how modest changes in the docking arrangement accommodate the new sidechain­base and sidechain­phosphate interactions. Such adaptations help explain the versatility of naturally occurring zinc finger proteins and their utility in design.

Introduction
Designing and selecting novel zinc finger proteins provides an exciting opportunity to explore the principles of protein­DNA recognition, and structural analysis of the new complexes is critical for careful interpretation of the results. Many zinc fingers with modified specificities have been produced via design and selection efforts (e.g. [1­8]). Only one of the resulting zinc finger­DNA complexes has been characterized structurally [9], however, and in this case there is no wild-type structure available for direct comparison. Here we report systematic structural studies on a set of complexes resulting from selections performed by Rebar and Pabo [1]. The peptides selected were variants of Zif268, providing an excellent opportunity for careful structural analysis and comparison as the wild-type Zif268­DNA complex has been solved and refined to 1.6 Å resolution [10,11]. The Cys2His2 zinc finger proteins have a simple, modular structure. Each finger consists of about 30 amino acids and contains a short two-stranded antiparallel  sheet and an  helix. The sheet and the helix are held together by a small hydrophobic core and by a zinc ion that is coordinated by two conserved cysteines from the sheet region and two

conserved histidines from the  helix. Crystallographic studies of the three-finger Zif268 peptide­DNA complex revealed that each of the fingers has a similar docking arrangement and that the fingers use residues from the N-terminal portion of the  helix to contact bases in the major groove. In the Zif268­DNA complex, most of the base contacts involve the guanine-rich strand of the Zif268binding site (GCG/TGG/GCG), and each finger makes its primary contacts to a three base pair (bp) subsite. The Zif268­DNA complex structure revealed a characteristic pattern of contacts correlating certain residue positions along the  helix of each finger with certain base positions in that finger's subsite (Figure 1a). Comparing the three fingers shows that base contacts are made by amino acid residues at positions ­1, 2, 3 and 6 (numbering with respect to the start of each  helix). There is a general tendency for the residue at position ­1 of a finger's  helix to contact the 3 base (on the primary strand) of that finger's subsite, for the residue at position 3 of the  helix to contact the central base of the subsite, and for the residue at position 6 of the  helix to contact the 5 base. The residue at position 2 of the  helix also projects directly into the major groove and sometimes contacts a base that is

Structure

Peptide sequences, binding sites and canonical pattern of base contacts. (a) Schematic view of characteristic interactions between a Zif268-like zinc finger and its DNA subsite (not all contacts are made by every finger, and additional atypical contacts can occur). Residue positions in the finger are numbered with respect to the start of the  helix. Arrows indicate the most common pattern of sidechain­base interactions, and the core three base pair subsite is shaded in gray. (b) Sequences of the zinc finger peptides. Each of the Zif268 variants contains three zinc fingers and 90 amino acids, but these peptides differ at the four positions of finger one (indicated with open circles) that were randomized by Rebar and Pabo [1]. These residues correspond to positions ­1, 2, 3 and 6 of the  helix, and residues selected at these positions are shown at the top of this panel. The three fingers are aligned to highlight conserved residues and secondary structure elements: the helix is indicated by a cylinder and the  strands by arrows. The conserved cysteine and histidine residues that are ligands for the zinc ions are highlighted in bold. (Figure adapted from [11].) (c) Sequences of the DNA-binding sites used for cocrystallization, which contain ten base pairs of duplex DNA and have a single overhanging nucleotide at each 5 end. The subsites under finger one are shown in boldface.

on the secondary strand of the DNA and just outside of the 3 bp subsite. (One can -- for simplicity -- describe the Zif268­DNA complex in terms of 3 bp subsites that include the primary base contacts, or one can -- to include the contacts made by residue 2 -- describe the complex in terms of 4 bp subsites that overlap by 1 bp at each finger­finger boundary.) Residues from these same four positions along the  helix (­1, 2, 3 and 6) also make critical base contacts in other zinc finger­DNA complex crystal structures, and in many cases these contacts involve corresponding bases within a given finger's subsite [9,12­14]. Such observations have led to much discussion about the prospects for deriving a `code' governing zinc finger­DNA interactions (e.g. [2,15]). To test the versatility of the zinc finger motif in recognition and to explore potential patterns of sidechain­base interactions, Rebar and Pabo [1] randomized positions ­1, 2, 3 and 6 in finger one of Zif268 (leaving fingers two and three unchanged) and used phage display to select variants that bound to alternative DNA sites. In these target DNA sites (which contained a full-length binding site for the three-finger peptide), the region normally recognized by finger one was altered from the GCGG/T preferred by the wild-type protein to either GACC or GCAC (where underlined bases emphasize the primary

3 bp subsites). When selections were performed against the GACC-containing site, the consensus amino acids obtained at positions ­1, 2, 3 and 6 were aspartate, serine, asparagine and arginine (DSNR). Selections against the GCAC-containing site were performed under two different sets of conditions, giving a consensus of glutamine, glycine, serine and arginine (QGSR) at these positions when the wild-type binding site was used as a competitor in the selections, and a consensus of arginine, alanine, aspartate and arginine (RADR) when nonspecific DNA was used as a competitor [1]. In this paper, we report a series of cocrystal structures (involving a total of seven different complexes) that allow detailed analysis of the contacts made by the DSNR, QGSR and RADR variants at several different DNA sites. These structures provide important data about the adaptability and versatility of the zinc finger motif -- revealing how alternative sidechain­base and sidechain­phosphate interactions can be accommodated in the zinc finger framework -- and give us new perspectives on the prospects for a zinc finger­DNA recognition code.

every case, cocrystals contained a full three-finger peptide bound to a duplex site that included a ten bp region of double-stranded DNA. As sequence changes are confined to finger one of the peptide and to its corresponding 3­4 bp subsite on the DNA, our notation highlights these regions. Our designation for each 90 amino acid peptide (such as `DSNR') refers to the residues selected at positions ­1, 2, 3 and 6 of the  helix in finger one. (These positions correspond to residues 18, 20, 21 and 24 of the three-finger peptide.) Our designation for each ten bp duplex DNA site (such as `GACC') refers to the subsite for finger one, and we underline the 3 bp region that, by analogy with the wild-type Zif268 complex, might be expected to be involved in the primary base contacts. In the course of this project, seven new cocrystal structures have been solved and refined. Studies involved the variant peptides (DSNR, QGSR and RADR) each crystallized with the target site that had been used in the selections. To gain a deeper understanding of the differential basis of specificity, these peptides were also studied with other sites and the wild-type Zif268 peptide was crystallized with one of the variant sites. In the following sections, we proceed to summarize each of these structures, focusing on the contacts made by residues ­1, 2, 3 and 6 in the  helix of finger one. Other contacts seen in these complexes (such as the conserved contacts made by fingers two and three) are summarized in a later section.

The DSNR peptide with the targeted GACC site

The DSNR variant had been obtained via selections with a GACC-binding site, and the 2.1 Å structure of this complex gives a very satisfying explanation for the specificity. Each of the selected residues contacts a different base pair (Figure 2a). Both carboxylate oxygens of Asp18 (the residue at position ­1 of the  helix) contact the exocyclic amine of C10 (2.9 Å and 3.3 Å). The hydroxyl group of Ser20 (position 2 of the helix) is near two potential hydrogen-bond acceptors: the O6 of G11 (2.7 Å) and the O4 of T12 (3.3 Å). Ser20 can donate a hydrogen bond to only one of these bases at a time; we presume that the serine usually hydrogen bonds to G11 as it is closer to this base. Asn21, at position 3 of the helix, makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with A9 (both 3.0 Å). Finally, Arg24, residue 6 of the helix, makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with G8 (2.9 Å and 3.0 Å). These key residues also make several water-mediated contacts with the DNA. Ser20 and Asp18 serve as ligands for a water molecule which contacts the O4 of T12. Arg24 makes one water-mediated contact to the O4 of T9 and another to the phosphate of base 7.
The DSNR peptide with the wild-type GCGT site

A complex of the DSNR peptide with the wild-type GCGT site (to which it binds less tightly) was also solved (at 1.9 Å resolution) to help us understand the basis for specificity, and we find that the DSNR peptide makes fewer contacts with this site (Figure 2b). Asp18 does not

Water molecules are represented as salmon spheres; only those water molecules that mediate interactions between the peptide and base pairs 8­10 are shown.

make any contacts to the DNA. Ser20 interacts with the phosphate of A11 (3.5 Å), and a single water molecule bridges Ser20 to both the N6 and N7 of this base. The sidechain oxygen of Asn21 makes a single hydrogen bond with the exocyclic amine of C9 (3.4 Å), while Arg24 makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with G8 (2.9 Å and 3.0 Å). As in the previous complex, Arg24 also makes watermediated contacts to the O6 of G9 and to the phosphate of base 7.

finger­DNA complexes, e.g. [12].) Gly20, the residue at position 2 of this  helix, does not make any base contacts or adopt any unusual , angles, and it is not yet clear why glycine occurs at this position. Specificity of recognition in the QGSR complex may also be enhanced via several water-mediated contacts. The NH2 of the Gln18 sidechain interacts with both the O6 of G11 and the O4 of T12 through a single bridging water molecule. Ser21 makes a water-mediated contact to the phosphate of base 8, and Arg24 makes watermediated contacts with the O6 of G9 and the phosphate of base 7.
The RADR peptide with the targeted GCAC site

The QGSR variant had been selected for its ability to bind the GCAC target site in the presence of competing wildtype site. For this particular cocrystal, molecular replacement failed to give clear density for finger one, and multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) was used to solve the structure. Combining the MIR phases with phases from a partial model (containing fingers two and three with their subsites) gave an interpretable map at 1.6 Å resolution, but the resulting density suggested that finger one (up to about residue 22) is somewhat disordered in this crystal. The density for the sidechains of Gln18, Ser21 and Arg24, however, was still readily interpretable, indicating that they have well defined conformations and allowing us to model the key contacts. The sidechains of residues 18, 21 and 24 each make direct and water-mediated contacts with the bases, and our structure readily explains the specificity for the GCAC site (Figure 3): Gln18, the residue immediately preceding the  helix, makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with A10 (2.8 Å and 3.0 Å); Ser21, from position 3 of the  helix, accepts a hydrogen bond from the N4 of C9 (3.5 Å); Arg24 makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with G8 (2.9 Å and 3.0 Å). In addition, the C of Ser19, the first residue in this  helix, makes van der Waals contacts with the methyl group of T12 (3.4 Å). (In the set of structures reported here, this is the only example of a base contact made by a residue that is not at position ­1, 2, 3 or 6 of the  helix, although such contacts are seen in other zinc

The RADR variant also had been selected for binding to the GCAC site, but in this case nonspecific DNA had been used as a competitor. The 1.6 Å crystal structure shows that finger one of the RADR peptide makes relatively few base contacts with the targeted GCAC site (Figure 4a). To our surprise, we find that Arg18, the residue at position ­1 of the  helix, interacts with the phosphate of base 9 rather than contacting a base. Asp21, which is at position 3 of the helix, makes a bifurcated hydrogen bond to Arg18 but does not make any direct contacts with the DNA. The only direct base contacts from this finger are made by the residues at positions 2 and 6 of the  helix: Ala20 makes a van der Waals contact with the methyl group of T12 (3.6 Å), and Arg24 makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with G8 (2.9 Å and 3.1 Å). There are also a few water-mediated contacts in this complex. Asp21 makes one water-mediated contact to the N4 of C9 and another water-mediated contact to the phosphate and O5 of G8. Arg24 makes a water-mediated contact to the O6 of G9.
The RADR peptide with the wild-type GCGT site

Binding studies had shown that the RADR peptide also binds very tightly to the wild-type site, and we studied

this complex to help us understand the significance of the new phosphate contact made by the RADR peptide with its targeted GCAC site. In the 2.0 Å complex with the wild-type site, as in the GCAC complex, Ala20 makes a van der Waals contact to T12 (3.5 Å) and Arg24 makes a pair of hydrogen bonds to G8 (2.8 Å and 2.9 Å) (Figure 4b). In this complex with the GCGT site, however, both Arg18 and Asp20 occupy two conformations. One conformation of each sidechain is similar to that observed in the GCAC complex: the arginine contacts the phosphate of base 9 (2.7 Å and 3.2 Å), and the aspartate makes a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the arginine. The alternate conformation of Arg18 makes a base contact, donating a pair of hydrogen bonds to G10 (3.3 Å and 3.5 Å) and hydrogen bonding with the alternative conformation of Asp21. (Note that adenine occupies position 10 in the GCAC complex.) This alternative conformation of Arg18 also makes water-mediated interactions with the O4 of T11 and with the N6 of A11. The other water-mediated contacts observed in this GCGT complex are ones that were seen in the complex with the targeted site: a water bridges the first conformation of Asp21 to the phosphate and O5 of G8, and another water bridges Arg24 to the O6 of G9.
The RADR peptide with the (less favorable) GACC site

bonds with Asp20. This second conformation of Arg18 allows the NH1 of the sidechain to form a hydrogen bond with the N7 of A10 (3.3 Å), but it also places the sidechain NH2 3.0 Å from the N6 of the adenine. There are no contacts with C8, and we do not observe any water-mediated contacts between finger one and the GCAC subsite. As observed in all of the other complexes, Arg24 (position 6) makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with G8 (2.8 Å and 3.0 Å).
Other contacts in this set of complexes

Binding studies had shown that the RADR peptide binds significantly less tightly to the GACC site, and this complex was also studied (at 1.9 Å resolution) to help analyze the differential basis for recognition. In this complex, Arg24 is the only residue from finger one that makes any base contacts (either direct or water-mediated) with the DNA (Figure 4c). Arg24 (position 6) makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with G8 (2.6 Å and 3.0 Å), but these have a somewhat different geometry than in the other complexes -- this arginine is tilted such that it also makes a hydrogen bond to the O4 of T9 (2.8 Å). Neither Arg18, Ala20, nor Asp21 make any contacts with the DNA, and there actually appear to be two unfavorable interactions between the peptide and the GACC site: Arg24 is 3.3 Å away from the N6 of A9, and Asp21 is 3.2 Å away from the phosphate of base 8.
The wild-type RDER peptide with the GCAC site

In describing these seven complexes, our discussion has focused on finger one as this is the region that was randomized and because our structures show that other regions of the complex are relatively well conserved. In all of the complexes described here, fingers two and three make the same base contacts that they do in the wild-type Zif268 complex. Arg46 and His49 (positions ­1 and 3 of finger two) hydrogen bond to guanines in the central TGG subsite. Arg74 and Arg80 (positions ­1 and 6 of finger three) hydrogen bond to guanines in the terminal GCG subsite. As observed in the high-resolution structure of the wild-type complex [11], the aspartic acids at position 2 in these helices also play a role in recognition. Asp48 (in finger two) contacts C8 on the secondary strand of the DNA. Asp76 (finger three) makes a water-mediated contact to C3 (in all seven of the complexes) and may have a weak favorable interaction with the N6 of A5 (which is 3.2­3.6 Å away in the various structures). In addition, several of the residues that interact with the phosphate backbone in the Zif268 complex make the same contacts in all seven variant complexes: His25 and His53 (conserved zinc ligands from fingers one and two) contact the phosphates of base 7 and base 4, respectively; Ser47 makes a water-mediated contact to the phosphate of base 9; Thr52, the residue at position 6 in the helix of finger two, makes a water-mediated contact to the phosphate of base 4; Arg74 (the residue at position ­1 of the helix in finger three) makes another water-mediated contact with the same phosphate. Although many contacts are fully conserved, some residues -- especially in finger one -- make phosphate contacts only in a subset of the complexes. For example, Arg3 interacts with the phosphate of base 8 in every complex except the QGSR­ GCAC and RADR­GACC complexes, while Arg14 contacts the phosphate of base 7 in the wild-type, DSNR­ GACC and RADR­GCAC complexes, but not in the other structures. On the whole, the structure and contacts of the finger two and finger three region are very well conserved in this set of complexes.
DNA conformation

To gain additional information about discrimination and specificity, we crystallized the wild-type peptide (which prefers the GCGT site) with the less favorable GCAC site and solved this structure at 2.3 Å resolution. (Prompted by the RADR structures, we wondered what would happen to Arg18 when the guanine at position 10 was replaced with adenine.) In this complex, we find that Arg18, the residue at position ­1, has two distinct conformations (Figure 4d). In one conformation, Arg18 interacts with the phosphate of base 9 (2.9 Å and 3.0 Å) and makes a bifurcated hydrogen bond to Glu21. In the other conformation, Arg18 extends towards A10 and makes a pair of hydrogen

The DNA in the wild-type Zif268 complex, and in the other zinc finger­DNA complexes of known crystal structures, is a distinctive form of B DNA [9­14,16]. This conformation, called Benlarged groove DNA, is characterized by

an unusually wide and deep major groove that results from a slight unwinding of the DNA and an increased displacement of the base pairs from the helical axis [16]. Analysis of the helical parameters for each of the seven structures reported here reveals that the DNA has a Benlarged groove DNA conformation in every complex, even those in which finger one makes relatively few contacts with the DNA. (The DNA conformation may change when the protein binds, as it appears to in the wild-type Zif268 and Sp1 zinc finger complexes [11,17], and this may be propagated as a cooperative structural change for the entire site.) In the seven complexes, the average helical twist angle ranges from 31.7° to 32.3° (corresponding to 11.1­11.4 bps per turn), and the average displacement of the base pairs from the helical axis ranges from 1.6 Å to 1.8 Å (as determined with the program NEWHEL93 [18]). These values are very similar to those observed for the wild-type Zif268 complex, where the average helical twist angle is 32.1° (corresponding to 11.2 bps per turn) and the average displacement is 1.6 Å.

perspective. Each base pair in the subsite is contacted by one of the four residues that had been randomized. These contacts preserve the characteristic alignment of specific residue positions in the  helix with specific base positions in the subsite (Figure 1a), and the sidechain­base interactions can readily be rationalized in terms of a recognition code. (Note, however, that serine may make a limited contribution to specificity, as serine can act as either a hydrogen-bond donor or acceptor and all four bases have a hydrogen-bond acceptor or donor at a similar position.) The idea that the set of contacts made by DSNR to the GACC site contributes to specificity was confirmed structurally by crystallizing this peptide with the wild-type site. The peptide has approximately 100fold lower affinity for this GCGT site, and we find that the DSNR peptide makes fewer contacts at this site (compare Figure 5a and b). Comparisons of these variant complexes with known structures are also relevant when thinking about a code, and we note that finger five of the GLI peptide [12], which has DSSK at the key  helical positions, also binds a GACC subsite. Comparing this finger with finger one of the DSNR complex (Figure 6a) shows that in both cases the 5 guanine is recognized by a basic residue at position 6 of the helix (arginine in finger one of DSNR and lysine in finger five of GLI). The middle base, adenine, is recognized by either an asparagine (DSNR) or a serine (GLI) from position 3 of the  helix. In both complexes the 3 cytosine is recognized by an aspartic acid, albeit in somewhat different ways. In finger five of GLI, the aspartate immediately preceding the  helix makes a hydrogen bond to each of the cytosines in the subsite, whereas in finger one of DSNR the corresponding aspartate makes a hydrogen bond only to the first cytosine. Finally, in each complex, the guanine on the opposite strand in the fourth position of the subsite is contacted by a serine from position 2 of the  helix. The structure of the QGSR peptide with the targeted GCAC site also provides a reasonable explanation for the specificity of this peptide (Figure 5c), and the contacts observed can easily be rationalized in the context of a recognition code. Again, structural comparisons are very interesting in thinking about a code. The second finger of a designed peptide, which has QSDK at the key  helical positions, recognizes a GCAG subsite [9] that is very similar to the GCAC subsite recognized by finger one of QGSR. Both fingers use a basic residue at position 6 of the  helix to recognize the 5 guanine: arginine in finger one of QGSR, and lysine in finger two of the designed peptide (although this lysine also contacts an additional base; Figure 6b). Position 3 uses an aspartate (designed peptide) or serine (QGSR) to recognize the cytosine in the middle of the DNA subsite. In both complexes, the glutamine at position ­1 of the  helix makes a bidentate contact with the 3 adenine.

Discussion
This set of structures provides a basis for addressing many fundamental questions about zinc finger­DNA recognition. One of the most intriguing issues in the field involves the idea that there may be some type of simple `code' underlying zinc finger­DNA interactions (at least for the subfamily of Cys2His2 fingers most closely related to Zif268). The data presented here provide much new information about this question and about related issues involving structural plasticity and the physical/chemical basis for specificity. Given that the structures of peptides with suboptimal or alternative binding sites have also been determined, it is possible to examine the differential basis for site-specific recognition.
Is there a simple zinc finger­DNA `recognition code'?

In trying to understand how the variant proteins recognize their targeted sites, we begin by considering base contacts that may explain specificity, and discuss these in the context of ideas about a possible `recognition code' for zinc finger­DNA interactions. The crystal structure of the wild-type Zif268­DNA complex had shown that residues at positions ­1, 2, 3 and 6 of the  helix were especially important for site-specific recognition, providing the basis for randomizing these residues in the initial phage display experiments and for thinking about patterns of sidechain­base interactions. Figure 5 summarizes the contacts made by these residues of finger one in the wildtype Zif268 complex and in the seven new complexes described in this paper. In some cases, the basis for specificity seems quite clear and is generally consistent with ideas about a recognition code. The contacts between the DSNR peptide and the targeted GACC site seem especially satisfying from this

Figure 5 continued Summary of direct base and phosphate contacts made by the sidechains at positions ­1, 2, 3 and 6 of the helix in finger one. Only the base pairs contacted by these residues are represented; base pairs 1­7, which are contacted by fingers two and three, are not shown in this figure. Arrows indicate hydrogen bonds; the dotted arrow represents a hydrogen bond with marginal geometry. Lines ending in filled circles represent van der Waals interactions. The contacts are shown for the complexes formed between (a) DSNR and the targeted GACC site, (b) DSNR and the wild type GCGT site, (c) QGSR and the targeted GCAC site, (d) RADR and the targeted GCAC site, (e) RADR and the wild type GCGT site, (f) RADR and the GACC site, (g) Zif268 (RDER) and the GCAC site, and (h) Zif268 (RDER) and the wild type GCGT site [10,11].

and the much harder problem of trying to develop a code or algorithm that could predict an optimal set of contacts. The new phosphate contact seen in the complex between the RADR peptide and its targeted GCAC site illustrates another difficulty with developing an exhaustive recognition code and raises interesting questions about recognition and specificity. The structural results are quite surprising, as Arg18 (at position ­1, supported by Asp21 at position 3) contacts a phosphate and there are very few base contacts. Three additional structures were solved to help us understand the basis for specificity in binding of the RADR peptide. Firstly, the structure of the RADR peptide with the 140-fold less favorable GACC site was solved, and this structure revealed that there are indeed significantly fewer contacts with this less favorable site (Figures 5d and 5f). Secondly, binding studies had shown that the RADR peptide binds very well to the wild-type GCGT site (actually with a slightly greater affinity than for the targeted GCAC site). Our crystal structure of this complex shows that the Arg18/Asp21 pair has two conformations at the GCGT site: one conformation allows Arg18 to make a pair of hydrogen bonds with G10 that are similar to the contacts seen in the wild-type complex (Figure 5e and 5h); the other conformation allows Arg18 to make a phosphate contact that is very similar to that seen in the complex of the RADR peptide with the targeted GCAC site (Figure 5d and 5e). Finally, to further explore the role of Arg18, the structure of the wild-type RDER peptide with the GCAC site was solved (where binding is about twofold weaker than at the wild-type site). Again multiple conformations occur, with

In summary, comparing our fingers with previous structures clearly reveals related patterns of sidechain­base interactions (as expected for a code). These comparisons, however, reveal that there is no simple one-to-one correspondence between the identity of the base at a given position of the subsite and the identity (or even location within the  helix) of the amino acid used to recognize that base. The idea of having an exhaustive code is also complicated by the observed sets of water-mediated contacts, by occasional secondary contacts (such as those made by the aspartate in GLI and the lysine in the designed peptide) and by occasional contacts from other positions in the helix (such as those made by Ser19 of QGSR and by the arginine in GLI). Such results highlight the difference between using a code to rationalize a set of contacts, which often proves to be relatively satisfactory,

an Arg18/Glu21 pair contacting the phosphate in one arrangement and an Arg18/Asp20 pair contacting A10 in the alternative conformation (Figure 5g). Comparing these four structures with each other and with that of the wild-type complex reveals that the acidic residues at position 2 or 3 of the helix play a key role in orienting the arginine at position ­1 and thus help determine what sort of contacts the arginine makes with the DNA. (The most favorable conformation for Arg18 is that which maximizes contacts with nearby acidic residues as well as with the DNA.) Such interactions between sidechains introduce an additional level of complexity that can not readily be incorporated into a recognition code. Similarly, phosphate contacts such as those observed in the RADR complexes would be difficult to predict with any existing code. In addition, in our structures of all the variant complexes, water-mediated contacts are observed between the peptide and the DNA. These contacts may help enhance the specificity of binding, but it is not clear how they can be included in a simple recognition code.
Structural adaptations in the zinc finger framework

Figure 7

A central issue in designing fingers with novel binding specificities and in thinking about a recognition code involves understanding how various sidechain­base interactions can be accommodated in zinc finger­DNA complexes. How does the position and orientation of the polypeptide backbone (which will be determined by folding and docking of the whole domain) help to determine which sidechain­base interactions are possible? How can a longer or shorter sidechain be accommodated at a given position? Clearly, some structural plasticity is needed to accommodate new sidechain­base interactions (since, for example, glutamine and arginine are not isosteric), but too much flexibility may allow interactions to occur at other, nonspecific sites and thereby actually reduce the specificity of recognition. The structures reported here provide an excellent basis for considering these issues as we can directly compare the variant complexes with the wild-type complex. Three examples are considered in order to illustrate the range of structural variation observed. The complex between the QGSR peptide and its targeted site provides our first example of how alternative contacts can be accommodated. In this complex, the orientation of finger one with respect to the DNA appears to be quite similar to that of finger one in the wild-type complex (Figure 7a). There are changes, however, in the conformation of finger one (rmsd = 0.61 Å for the  carbons), particularly at the N-terminal end of the  helix, that appear to be necessary for accommodating the new contacts. The structure of the RADR peptide with its targeted site (which has a new phosphate contact from the arginine at

position ­1) illustrates another type of structural rearrangement. Here the conformation of finger one is very similar to that seen in the wild-type complex (rmsd = 0.31 Å for the  carbons). The orientation of finger one with respect to the DNA is rather different, however. It appears to have rotated away from the DNA, pivoting as a relatively rigid unit around a point near the C-terminal end of the  helix (Figure 7b). The complex between the DSNR peptide and its targeted site shows changes in both the conformation and docking of finger one (Figure 7c). Here finger one rotates (as a unit) so that it is closer to the DNA. In addition, the conformation of the N-terminal end of the  helix is slightly different in the DSNR variant than in the wild-type peptide (rmsd = 0.66 Å for the  carbons). Together, these changes permit the aspartate at position ­1 of the  helix (which is much shorter than the arginine of the wild-type peptide) to reach the DNA. (This aspartate may also help stabilize the altered conformation of the  helix, since it makes a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of the third residue in the helix.) The DSNR­GACC complex may be the extreme case (within this subfamily of closely related structures), but some alterations in the conformation and/or orientation of finger one are seen in all of the complexes. Recognizing alternative sites by varying sidechains on the conserved zinc finger framework involves a fine balance between plasticity and rigidity of the zinc finger unit. Modularity of zinc finger peptides is another key issue in recognition and design, and our structures show that in these Zif268 variant complexes most of the changes are limited to the region involving finger one and the corresponding 3­4 bp subsite: in each of the seven complexes, we find that fingers two and three and the corresponding regions of the DNA are very similar to those in the wildtype Zif268 complex. (Of course, finger one variants that disrupted contacts made by fingers two and three would pay a severe energetic penalty and presumably would not have been selected in the phage display protocol.) The conserved structure of the finger two/finger three region is visually striking (three examples are shown in Figure 7) and is confirmed by noting rms distances for the superimposed complexes. (Superimposing  carbons for fingers two and three and phosphorous and C1 atoms for the corresponding base pairs, 2­7, gives rms distances of 0.38 Å, 0.35 Å and 0.49 Å when comparing the wild-type complex with complexes of the QGSR, RADR and DSNR peptides at their targeted sites.) Overall, we find that alterations in finger one had relatively little effect on the structure and docking of fingers two and three.
Conclusions

recognition. The new sidechain­base and sidechain­ phosphate interactions in these Zif268 variants are accommodated by relatively modest changes in the structure and docking of finger one. There are no substantive changes in the region involving fingers two and three. These two important observations provide a direct structural basis for understanding the versatility, modularity, and adaptability of the zinc finger motif. The complexes of the DSNR and QGSR peptides with their targeted sites have overall patterns of contacts that can be rationalized in terms of a (degenerate) recognition code. Our high-resolution structures, however, reveal many details that are not accounted for in any simple code. These include water-mediated contacts, details of the DNA conformation, and occasional contacts by residues at other positions along the  helix. The complex between the RADR peptide and its targeted site reveals unexpected phosphate contacts made by the arginine residue immediately preceding the  helix. This surprising new contact is facilitated by sidechain­sidechain interactions and by subtle changes in the overall docking arrangement of finger one. This variant structure would not have been predicted by any existing recognition code, as features like interactions between neighboring sidechains, alternative sidechain conformations, and changes in the conformation and orientation of the finger are difficult to incorporate into any code. In summary, a zinc finger­DNA recognition code -- which typically allows several alternatives at a given position -- can rationalize many sidechain­base interactions seen in this subfamily of closely related zinc finger­DNA complexes. The problem of predicting an optimal zinc finger sequence for any desired DNA target site is, however, much more difficult. Examining the structural complexity of the zinc finger­DNA interface -- as illustrated in our set of structures -- reveals the problems inherent in proceeding from a simple code to reliable three-dimensional models and energetic predictions. Proposed recognition codes (e.g. [2,15]) seem to summarize meaningful patterns and correlations of allowed sidechain­base interactions, but they cannot yet substitute for systematic optimization in finding the best finger to use at a given binding site or replace detailed structural analysis in understanding the full set of contacts.

Biological implications
Zinc fingers of the Cys2­His2 class constitute one of the most abundant and versatile DNA-binding motifs found in eukaryotes [19,20]. Zinc fingers have also provided a framework for the structure-based design and selection of proteins with novel DNA-binding specificities (e.g. [1­8]). In one such selection, key residues in the first finger of the three-finger Zif268 peptide were randomized

and three variant peptides with altered DNA-binding specificities were selected by phage display methods [1]. We report here the structures of each of these peptides bound to the target site used in its selection (the DSNR­GACC, QGSR­GCAC and RADR­GCAC complexes). To understand the differential basis of sitespecific recognition, the structures of four other combinations of peptides and binding sites (the DSNR­ GCGT, RADR­GCGT, RADR­GACC and RDER­ GCAC complexes) were also solved. Many of the contacts observed in these complexes, particularly those between the DSNR and QGSR peptides and their targeted sites, fit the pattern of interactions that has been observed in the wild-type Zif268 complex [10,11] and other zinc finger­DNA complexes [9,12­14]: in general, the residue immediately preceding the  helix tends to contact the 3 base in the finger's subsite, the third residue in the  helix to contact the middle base, the sixth residue in the  helix to contact the 5 base, and the second residue in the  helix to contact a base on the opposite strand of the DNA in the preceding finger's subsite. Not all of the observed contacts might have been predicted, however, and the new phosphate contacts identified in the RADR complexes were especially surprising. In general, it was found that the new contacts in the variant complexes are facilitated by changes in both the conformation of finger one and its orientation with respect to the DNA. Such adaptations, which accommodate new sidechain­base and sidechain­phosphate interactions within a generally conserved structural framework, provide a basis for understanding the versatility of naturally occurring zinc finger proteins and may facilitate design, selection, and model-building of other zinc finger­DNA complexes.

Materials and methods
Purification of zinc finger peptides
The wild-type Zif268 peptide was purified essentially as described [10], using a set of steps involving reversed-phase batch extraction, reversedphase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), cation exchange chromatography, and a final reversed-phase HPLC column. The RADR, QGSR and DSNR peptides were expressed as described [1], and the cells were lysed with a freeze/thaw protocol. Inclusion bodies containing the peptides were pelleted, then dissolved in 8 M urea and 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 and reduced with 150 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min at 70°C. The peptides were then loaded on a Source15S cation exchange column (Pharmacia) in 8 M urea, 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, and 10 mM DTT and were eluted with a NaCl gradient. The peptides were next purified on a C4 reversed-phase column (Vydac), reconstituted with zinc, and further purified on a Mono S cation exchange column (Pharmacia). The final purification step involved a C4 reversed-phase column run as described [10]. Purified peptides were stored dried in aliquots in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products). The expected mass of each peptide was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Harvard University Microchemistry Facility).

Crystallization
Each zinc finger­DNA complex was prepared by dissolving an aliquot of the dried peptide in water, adding 1.5 molar equivalents (per finger) of zinc chloride to the peptide, and adjusting the pH with buffer (to either 6.2 or 8.0, as indicated below). The folded peptide was then added to 1 molar equivalent of buffered duplex DNA binding site (oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified as described in [21]). The concentration of the zinc finger­DNA complex was about 1 mM; the complex was solubilized by the addition of NaCl (at concentrations indicated below). All crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion, using an anaerobic chamber to eliminate any risk of oxidation. In the two noncognate complexes involving the wild-type binding site (the DSNR­GCGT and RADR­GCGT complexes), the GCGT site is used because it was the binding site used in crystallization of the wildtype Zif268 complex [10,11]. Binding studies show that each of these two peptides has an equivalent affinity for the GCGT site used in this study as for the GCGC site used in [1] (ME-E, unpublished data). Crystals of the QGSR peptide with the GCAC-binding site were grown by mixing the complex, in 200 mM NaCl and 50 mM MES at pH 6.2,

For this complex, three isomorphous derivatives were prepared by substituting 5-iodouracil for thymine in the oligonucleotide. Cocrystals were grown with a single substitution at position 5, a single substitution at position 12, and substitutions at both positions 5 and 12 (numbering as in Figure 1b). Crystals of the RADR peptide with the GCAC site were obtained by doing two successive rounds of macroseeding into drops prepared with two volumes of this complex (in 600 mM NaCl and 75 mM MES, pH 6.2) and one volume of well buffer (22.5% PEG 3350, 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM MES, pH 6.2). Small crystals of the wild-type Zif268­ DNA complex [10,11] were used as seeds in the first round; RADR­ GCAC crystals produced at this stage were used for a second round of seeding. Crystals of the RADR peptide with the GCGT binding site were grown by mixing the complex, in 300 mM NaCl and 75 mM MES at pH 6.2, with an equal volume of well buffer (35% PEG 3350, 200 mM NaCl, 25 mM MES, pH 6.2).

Crystals of the DSNR peptide with the GACC binding site were obtained by macroseeding with small crystals of the RADR­GCAC complex into drops containing two volumes of the DSNR­GACC complex (in 300 mM NaCl and 75 mM MES, pH 6.2) and one volume of well buffer (20% PEG 400, 200 mM MgCl2, 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5).

Phasing, model building and refinement
For each complex, an initial set of phases was obtained by molecular replacement. The 1.6 Å structure of the wild-type complex [11] was used as a search model, but the sidechains of residues 18­24 and all water molecules were deleted to minimize phase bias. Initial maps revealed readily interpretable density for finger one in six of the seven complexes. However, the initial map for the complex containing the QGSR peptide with the targeted GCAC site was not as clear, so this structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement. Each derivative data set was scaled to the native data by local scaling with MAXSCALE (MA Rould, personal communication). Heavy atom refinements and phase calculations were carried out in MLPHARE [23,24]. Phasing statistics for the three derivatives, which gave an overall figure of merit of 0.55, are shown in Table 2. An interpretable electron-density map was obtained by using SIGMAA [24,25] to combine the MIR phases with phases from a partial model (containing fingers two and three and the corresponding DNA subsites from the wild-type complex). For each of the seven complexes, model building was done with the program O [26]. The automatic search routines PEAKMAX and WATPICK from the CCP4 package [24] facilitated modeling the water structure. Water molecules were included only if there was clear spherical density in the 2Fo­Fc and Fo­Fc maps and at least one hydrogenbond donor or acceptor within 3.5 Å. Each round of rebuilding was followed by simulated annealing or Powell minimization and by restrained
