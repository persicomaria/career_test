Abstract Plant lectins, especially those purified from species of the Leguminosae family, represent the best studied group of carbohydrate-binding proteins. The legume lectins from Diocleinae subtribe are highly similar proteins that present significant differences in the potency/ efficacy of their biological activities. The structural studies of the interactions between lectins and sugars may clarify the origin of the distinct biological activities observed in this high similar class of proteins. In this way, this work presents a crystallographic study of the ConM and CGL (agglutinins from Canavalia maritima and Canavalia gladiata, respectively) in the following complexes: ConM/ CGL:Man(a1-2)Man(a1-O)Me, ConM/CGL:Man(a1-3)Man(a1-O)Me and ConM/CGL:Man(a1-4)Man(a1-O)Me, which crystallized in different conditions and space group from the native proteins. The structures were solved by molecular replacement, presenting satisfactory values for Rfactor and Rfree. Comparisons between ConM, CGL and ConA (Canavalia ensiformis lectin) binding mode with the dimannosides in subject, presented different interactions patterns, which may account for a structural explanation of the distincts biological properties observed in the lectins of Diocleinae subtribe.

structure of glycans attached to soluble and integral cellmembrane glycoconjugates (Gabius and Gabius, 1997). Plant lectins are valuable tools for biochemical, analytical, and therapeutic purposes (Lis and Sharon, 1986). Legume lectins in particular have become a model system for protein­carbohydrate recognition because of their wide range of specificities for monosaccharides as well as for complex carbohydrates. Recognition between proteins and carbohydrates is of prime importance in many biological processes,

such as viral, bacterial, mycoplasmal and parasitic infections, targeting of cells and soluble components, fertilization, cancer metastasis and growth and differentiation (Sharon and Lis, 1990). The specific recognition of an (oligo)saccharide by a protein is a much more complex problem than other biologically relevant recognition processes such as protein­protein or protein­DNA interactions (Loris et al., 2004). The legume lectins from the Diocleinae subtribe are highly similar proteins that exhibit different biological activities such as human lymphocyte proliferation and interferon c production (Barral-Netto et al., 1992), peritoneal macrophage stimulation and inflammatory reaction (Rodriguez et al., 1992), induction of paw edema and peritoneal cell immigration in rats (Bento et al., 1993), histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (Gomes et al., 1994, 1996), nitric oxide production (Andrade et al., 1999) and in vivo lymphocyte activation and apoptosis (Barbosa et al., 2001) among others. Several factors contribute to these differences in the activities: for example, the pH-dependent oligomerization that some of these lectins present and the relative position of the carbohydrate-binding site (Wah et al., 2001) as well as minor changes in the residues located at key positions regarding to quaternary association (Brinda et al., 2004). The distinct biological activities presented by Canavalia ensiformis lectin (ConA) and Canavalia brasiliensis lectin (ConBr) have been shown to be a consequence of only one non-conservative substitution that affects the carbohydrate-binding site, making it more open in ConBr than it is in ConA (Sanz-Aparicio et al., 1997). The structural studies of these proteins are important not only to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which these molecules produce their distinct biological activities, but also to highlight several aspects of the protein­carbohydrate interaction and how lectins decipher the great informative potential encoded into the structures of glycans. Thus, we have determined the crystallographic structure of six complexes: Canavalia gladiata lectin (CGL) and Canavalia maritima lectin (ConM) with dimannosides Man(a1-2)Man(a1-O)Me, Man(a1-3)Man(a1-O)Me and Man(a1-4)Man(a1-O)Me, in order to improve the understanding of the structural basis for the affinity of lectins for different dimannosides. 2. Materials and methods The crystallization procedures, data collection and processing were previously described in detail (Moreno et al., 2006). The phase problem for all the crystal structures was solved by the molecular replacement method using the program MolRep (Vargin and Teplyakov, 1997) from the CCP4 package (CCP4, 1994) (``Collaborative Computational Project, number 4, 1994''). ConM (PDB code: 2CWM) and CGL structures (PDB code: 1 WUV) were used as the search model, with all waters removed.

The initial models were afterwards submitted to several cycles of rigid body and restrained refinement, using the program REFMAC5 and monitored using the Rfree and Rfactor values (Brunger, 1992). The electron densities were visualized through XtalView (Mcree, 1999), in which dimannosides were fitted and subtle adjustments in the models were carried out, followed by restrained refinement. The PDB entries for all the dimannosides were generated with the program Library/Sketcher from CCP4 package. The quality of these models was inspected by the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and the accessible surface areas were calculated using the program NACCESS (Hubbard and Thornton, 1993) with a probe ° radius of 1.4 A. Van der Walls contacts were analyzed using the CCP4 program CONTACT with a cut-off dis° tance of 4.5 A. The crystallographic B-factors (overall, main chains, side chains, waters and the sugars) as well as the Ramachandran plot and root-mean-squares deviations from ideal geometry are presented in Tables 1 and 3. The final refinement statistics for ConM and CGL complexes are presented in Tables 2 and 4, respectively. All figures and superpositions were performed using the program PyMOL (Delano, 2002). 3. Results and discussion 3.1.

As previously observed in other legume lectins, the ConM monomer consists of 237 amino acids folded as a b sandTable 1 Ramachandran plot and root-mean-square deviations from ideal geometry for ConM structures ConM: M1-2M Residues distribution Most favorable (%) Allowed (%) Additionally allowed (%) Forbidden (%) 89.4 9.7 1.0 0 ConM: M1-3M 86.8 12.7 0.4 0.1 ConM: 0M1-4M 87.8 11.9 0.4 0.0 0.021 2.218 19.437 20.1982 23.577 20.542 20.938

wich (Srinivas et al., 2001). The complexes do not present significant structural differences when compared to native protein in any parts, other than the carbohydrate-binding region. The carbohydrate electron densities from M1-3M and M1-2M complexes are very well defined in all subunits, while the ones from M1-4M complexes are well defined in only two subunits (A and B). In the remaining subunits from M1-4M complexes (C and D), the electron density corresponding to the O4-linked mannose is not clear, making impossible to model the dimannoside's second ring. All carbohydrate sites from the six structures are located at the interface of crystallographic symmetric related subunits, establishing numerous contacts with their symmetry mates, with the exception of the C and D subunits from M1-4M complexes, which are partially poorly defined as previously mentioned. Fig. 1 shows the electron densities for the three dimannosides after the final refinement. In the case of M1-3M and M1-4M complexes, which crystallized as a tetramer, the densities shown are the ones with the best definition. 3.2. M1-3M and M1-4M complexes 3.2.1. Monosaccharide-binding site (first mannose) In all four complexes, the O1-linked mannose interacts with the conserved monosaccharide site in a way very similar to ConA, with very small differences regarding the distances of these interactions, which are probably due to the crystallographic packing. This binding mode has been already extensively studied previously (Bourne et al., 1990, 1994,). Thus, the sugar is harbored through nine intermolecular H bonds formed between O2, O3, O4, O5 and O6 of the saccharide and the amino acid side chains present in the site. 3.2.2. O3 linked mannose and O4 linked mannose It is well established that legume lectins possess three types of hydrophobic subsites based on different ligand affinities. One of these subsites is adjacent to the conserved monosaccharide biding site, explaining the fact that hydrophobic glyco/mannosides and other monosaccharide hydrophobic derivatives bind more strongly (10­50 times) than their non-hydrophobic analogs (Sharon and Lis, 1990). Kanellopoulos and co-workers (1996) determined the crystal structures for two ConA complexes: ConA/4 0 nitrophenyl-a-D-mannopyranoside (a-PNM, PDB code: 1VAM) and ConA/4 0 -nitrophenil-a-D-glucopyranoside (aPNG, PDB code: 1VAL), revealing that the hydrophobic moiety of these molecules interacted with a hydrophobic subsite formed by Tyr12, Leu99 and Tyr100. The O3 linked and the O4 linked mannoses of our structures bind to this same subsite, as depicted in Fig. 2. This binding involves primarily hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions (Table 5). Both dimannosides, M1-3M and M1-4M, are positioned in the subsite in a similar way, with the side chain of Leu99

stacked against one face of the ring. Despite that, M1-3M is placed more internally, with the anomeric methyl turned to the subsite; evidences for this are both the greater number of van der Waals interactions when compared to the M1-4M and the presence of H bonds in such complexes. This difference can be cleared noticed in Table 5 and in Fig. 2. Polar interactions, in this case occurring with participation of Tyr12, are only observed for M1-3M. In three subunits, there is an interaction involving the O3 linked mannose and O1 of the sugar and in two, there's an interaction involving O2; in the C subunit, both interactions aforementioned occur simultaneously (Fig. 2). This variation is very likely a consequence of the crystallographic packing. The crystal structures of the complexes of ConA and a-PNG and a-PNM also show this peculiarity, once H bonds occur between Tyr12 and Tyr100 and the O7

and O8 of the carbohydrates, but they vary in both number and strength from subunit to subunit. The occurrence of H bonds between Tyr12 from ConM and disaccharides has been previously reported to the crystal structures of ConM:Trehalose (PDB code: 2CY6) and ConM:Maltose (PDB code: 2CYF) (Delatorre et al., 2006). This work suggests that the interaction established between the hydroxyl group from Tyr12 and the outer glycose of each complex enhances the lectin ability to bind carbohydrates. 3.3. Comparison between ConM/CGL:M1-3M and ConA:M1-3M Bouckaert and co-authors (1999) determined the crystal structures of ConA complexed to M1-3M (PDB code: 1QDO) and M1-6M (PDB code: 1QDC). The O3-linked mannose from M1-3M interacts with the subsite formed by Tyr12, Tyr100 and Leu99, while the O6linked mannose from M1-6M interacts with other subsite formed by Tyr12 and Asp16. In ConA, M1-3M only establishes van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions, while in ConM and CGL it forms two H bonds to Tyr12. Besides that, M1-3M have more van der Waals interactions with ConM's and CGL's subsite than with ConA's (Table 5). The occurrence of H bonds in ConM and CGL complexed with M1-3M, which are absent in ConA:M1-3M, the greater number of van der Waals contacts and a larger contact surface area upon complexation (ConM: ° ° ° 282 A2, CGL: 282 A2, ConA: 275 A2) should enhance ConM's and CGL's affinity to this dimannoside. In the same way, it is expected that ConM and CGL show greater affinity for M1-3M than for M1-4M (ConM: ° ° 261 A2, CGL: 261 A2). Nevertheless, appearance of extra interactions and a greater contact area do not necessarily imply a higher affinity (Singha et al., 1996). That is the case for the complexes ConA:M1-3M and ConA:M16M, where despite M1-6M hydrogen bonds with the

In the case of the M1-4M complex, the tighter closed site from PAL allows for the establishment of an H bond between the O1 from the second mannose and the Asp136 that occupies the position corresponding to Asp16 from ConM, CGL and ConA. Besides, this conformation is stabilized by a second H bond between O6 from the second mannose and the NE2 from Gln22, which occupies the same position as Tyr100 from ConM, CGL and ConA. 3.4. Waters involved in carbohydrate-binding site

hydroxyl group from Tyr12 and has greater buried surface area, M1-3M interacts with a 4 times higher affinity. Similarly, the lectin from Pterocarpus angolensis (PAL) presents greater number of interactions to the dimannosides M1-3M, M1-4M and M1-6M than to MeMan, but its affinity is essentially equal for all four sugars (Loris et al., 2004). Thus, to establish real affinity comparisons for the complexes presented here, thermodynamics studies are necessary. As previously described for ConA, M1-3M's and M14M's conformations are essentially equal in PAL, ConM and CGL, despite the different residues forming the sites. In the case of M1-3M complexes, the sugar is slightly dislocated, which happens due to the presence of a Glu221 on PAL in the same place where there is a Leu99 on ConA, ConM and CGL. If the M1-3M conformation in canavalia structures was similar to the one presented on PAL, it would cause a van der Waals clash between Leu99's CD2 and the second's mannose O1. This M1-3M conformation adopted for PAL also allows for OE1 from Glu221 to establish an H bond to the O4 from the second mannose and possibly a polar contact to the O1 from the second mannose.

Previous crystallographic study performed with legume lectins determined the occurrence of seven waters highly conserved in all structures, independently of their homology or carbohydrate affinity. A structural function is evident: four waters are linked with calcium and manganese ions and one of them is located at carbohydrate-binding site (Loris et al., 1994). A structural water at the active site occurs in all ConAlike structures containing at least a monosaccharide bound. This water makes hydrogen bonds with Arg228, Asn14 and Asp16, but not with the sugar. Bouckaert and co-workers (1999) propose that the function of this water is helping to increase the fit between the protein and sugar, rather than to serve as specific hydrogen bond mediators, giving the protein-binding surface a shape complementary to the sugar. In ConM/CGL:M1-2 M, ConA:M1-2M (PDB code: 1BXH) and ConA:M1-6M (PDB code: 1QDC) this water is perfectly conserved. However, in ConM and CGL complexes with M1-3M and M1-4M its location and interactions patterns are different; there is an additional water molecule making a hydrogen bond with the conserved structural water and Asp16 (Fig. 3a). The reason for this seems to be a difference in conformation of Asp16, which

The interstitial water W3 was observed only in M1-3M complexes and its interactions are expected to enhance the affinity of the protein by this dimannoside. (b) Waters involved in the active site of ConM:M1-2M complex (also observed in CGL complex). This network of interactions formed by the interstitial waters W60 and W27, as well as by structural waters W42 and W36 should contribute to the enhanced affinity calculated for M1-2M.

possess a ``turned up'' orientation in the complexes containing this additional water. In M1-3M structures, all the subunits possess the structural water (W1), interacting with Arg228 and Asn14 but only indirectly with Asp16, through W2, which is present in two monomers of ConM (A and B) and of CGL (B and D). ConM:M1-4M complex present W1 and W2 all monomers, with the exception of subunit C, that lacks density for W2. In CGL:M1-4M, the W1 is present in three subunits (A, B and D) while W2 was only detected in subunit A. These differences in water arrangement among the complexes can reflect an alteration in the affinity for the sugar (Mary et al., 1995), with implications in biological and physiological activities of the protein, or can be simply a consequence of crystallographic packing, since Asp16 have different conformations in the structures. In M1-3M complexes, three monomers possess an instersticial water (W3), linking indirectly the Arg228 to O3 and O2 of the dimannoside. Its interaction with W1 characterizes a small network of contacts, which must contribute for an enhanced affinity in the biding of these proteins to M1-3M (Fig. 3a). 3.5. M1-2M(Me) complexes 3.5.1. O2 linked mannose Unlike the M1-3M and M1-4M complexes, the second ring, the O2 linked mannose (called here as reducing mannose), interacts with the monosaccharide-binding site. In spite of minor modifications, the interaction pattern for this interaction is compatible with the observed for all legume lectins. The Goldstein Rules explain this alternative recognition: the requirements for carbohydrate binding to the monosaccharide-binding site are free equatorial hydroxyl groups at position 3 and 4 and a free primary alcohol group in the 6 position (Goldstein et al., 1974). Therefore,

both sugar rings from M1-2M(Me) can be potentially recognized by the monosaccharide-binding site. 3.6. Comparison between ConM/CGL:M1-2M(Me) and ConA:M1-2M complexes 3.6.1. M1-2M(Me) interaction manners The ConA:M1-2M(Me) crystallographic structure revealed two binding modes to this dimannoside (PDB code: 1BXH). In the subunit A, the O1 linked mannose interacts with the monosaccharide-binding site, while in the subunit D, the O2 linked mannose interacts with this site (reducing mannose). In the subunit B, the two distinct overlapping modes of binding for the disaccharide are present (Moothoo et al., 1999). 3.6.2. Subunit D from ConA:M1-2M(Me) The interaction of ConM/CGL and M1-2M(Me) is similar to that observed for ConA:M1-2M(Me) subunit D (Moothoo et al., 1999), where the O1 linked mannose lies in a polar site. In ConM, occur hydrogen bonds with Gly98, Leu99, Ser168 and Thr226. In addition, van der Waals interactions with Leu99 are important to stabilize the molecule. In the Subunit D of ConA:M1-2M(Me), the second ring is slightly rotated and there is no hydrogen bond between Gly98-O and Leu99-N with the sugar, in spite of them possess the same orientation (Fig. 4). In the PAL:M1-2M structure, the dimannoside presents the same orientation verified for the subunit D from ConM, CGL and ConA:M1-2M(Me), although they possess only 48% of similarity. A slight rotation in the saccharide occurs due the presence of a Thr226 in the Canavalia structures, in the same region where PAL possesses Gly104. As a consequence of this M1-2M binding mode, these proteins belong to the select group that makes interactions with the conserved stretch E and the sugar (Loris et al., 2004).

3.6.3. Subunit A from ConA:M1-2M(Me) The superimposition of ConM/CGL:M1-2M(Me) and ConA:M1-2M(Me) shows that the ConA interaction mode is sterically permitted in ConM, maximizing the interactions between anomeric methyl group and the hydrophobic subsite formed by Tyr12, Leu99 and Ty100, as well as C6 atom of the sugar with the protein. The crystallographic complex obtained with the Bowringia milbraedii lectin (BMA), a protein sharing 48% of similarity with ConA, and Man(a1-2)Man revealed an interaction very similar to that observed for the ConA:M1-2M(Me) subunit A. The only difference is a hydrogen bond between O1 of the reducing mannose and the Gln218 side chain, which should compensate the van der Waals anomeric methyl group interactions present in ConA (Buts et al., 2006). 3.6.4. ConA:M1-2M and waters involved in carbohydratebinding site In 2001, Sanders et al. obtained the ConA:Man(a12)Man complex (PDB code: 1I3H) at high resolution ° (1.2 A). In this structure, the O1 linked mannose binds to the monosaccharide-binding site and the O2 linked mannose interacts to a site formed by Tyr12, Asp16 and Arg228, constituting a distinct mode of M1-2M recognition by ConA. The high resolution of the complex allowed the precise localization of waters involved in carbohydratebinding site, and of two conformations for Arg228. The ConM:M1-2M(Me) structure also obtained in high resolu° tion (1.4 A) permits a detailed comparison of the net of waters presents at the biding site. As observed for the ConA:M1-2M complex, a net of waters bind the sugar to ConM/CGL (Fig. 3b). The water 60 links the O2 of the O1 linked mannose with Gly224. In the same way, the water 27 mediates the interaction between Arg228 and the O3 of O2 linked mannose. Two other water molecules, W36 and W42, seem to perform a structural function, giving to the binding site a shape complementary to the sugar. In addition, they also interact to Gly224, Arg228 and Thr226. This network should result in an enhancement in the dimannoside affinity. Contrasting with ConA:M1-2M, the structural conserved water interacts only with Asn14, Asp16 and Arg228, as conserved for several ConA-like structures complexes with sugars. In CGL, electron density is not observed for W27. 3.6.5. Thermodynamic aspects ConA binds to M1-2M 3 times stronger than to M1-3M and M1-4M and binds to M1-2M(Me) 3.4 times stronger than to M1-2M. Sanders et al. (2001) propose that the two binding modes of interactions observed for the complex ConA:Man(a1-2)Man(a1-O)Me are responsible for this affinity increase. PAL and BMA present highest affinity for M1-2M, and only one mode of interaction was verified for these structures. The CGL and ConM:M1-2M structures, although methylated also presents only one interaction mode with

M1-2M. In this way, thermodynamics analysis for this protein and the dimannosides in subject should complement this study and permit to elucidate which factors are important to the interaction between ConM, CGL and ConA with Man(a1-2)Man(a1-O)Me. 3.7. The influence of Histidine-205 in the conformation acquired by Man(a1-2)Man(a1-O)Me when interacting with ConA and ConM ConA:Man(a1-2)Man(a1-O)Me structure presents one mode of interaction in subunit A and a second mode in subunit D, which is the only one observed in for the M12M complexes reported here. Although the reason for that remains obscure, the ConM and CGL complexes points toward a likely responsible residue. In ConA:M1-2M(Me) (subunit D) and ConM/ CGL:M1-2M(Me), His205 has a ``turned up'' conformation, reaching Tyr100, while in ConA:M1-2M(Me) (subunit A), His205 presents a ``turned down'' conformation, reaching Tyr12. The His205 orientation should provoke conformational changes in the active site, favoring a determined interaction mode (Fig. 5). Unfortunately, these residues are located at points of crystal contacts, and the precise changes caused by His205 cannot be defined. We proposed that the ``turned down'' His205 conformation causes an approximation among Tyr12, Tyr100 and Leu99 and the second mannose, maximizing the van der Waals and hydrofobic interactions between the anomeric methyl group and the hydrophobic subsite, the same feature observed in ConA subunit A. In ``turned up'' His205 conformation (ConA subunit D,

Fig. 5. Superimposition of ConA subunit A (blue), ConA subunit D (red) and ConM (gray) complexed with M1-2M(Me). A double conformation adopted by His205 would be responsible by the two modes of interaction observed for M1-2M(Me). When His205 is ``turned down'', it provokes an approximation between the hydrofobic subsite (Tyr12, Leu99 and Tyr100) and the second mannose, maximizing the van der Waals interactions of the anomeric methyl group (C7) and the hydrofobic subsite. When His205 is ``turned up'', the more stable conformation is acquired through polar interactions with Thr226 and Ser168.

ConM and CGL), the residues from hydrophobic subsite do not approximate enough to the second mannose, and the latter acquires a conformation where the four hydrogen bonds formed with Ser168 and Thr226 must compensate for the anomeric methyl group interactions. Therefore, a possible double conformation for His205, as previously identified for Arg228 in the ConA:M1-2M complex and ° Thr15 in the native ConA at 1.15 A (PDB code: 1JBC) seems to offer a coherent explanation for the two interactions modes observed in the ConA:Man(a1-2)Man(a1O)Me. 3.8. Interaction lectin­carbohydrate and its relationship with biological activities In spite of high degree of similarity (98%), ConA and ConM present significant differences in their biological properties. For instance, ConA and ConM promote endothelium-dependent relaxant effects on aorta, however, ConM possesses a much higher potency than ConA (3 times), resulting in a release of nitric oxide (Gadelha et al., 2005). A recent investigation from our group revealed that in a 125 lg/mL concentration, ConA inhibited 100% the growth of Streptococcus mutansand Streptococcus sanguis, while ConM was incapable of any inhibition at the same concentration. On the other hand, ConM at 100 lg/mL was able to inhibit significantly the formation of biofilm from the S. mutans and S. sanguis, while ConA was incapable of inhibition at any concentration tested (unpublished results). Our data show that ConA and ConM have different patterns of interactions with dimannosides in subject, once these dissacharides are present in asparagine linked (Nlinked) carbohydrates which must be exposed at cell surface receptors for lectins, these results point toward structural insights for the distinct biological activities verified for the two proteins. Isothermal titration microcalorimetry studies (Dam et al., 1998) divided Diocleinae lectins in two groups, according to the affinity for biantennary complex oligosaccharides and related to their histamine-releasing properties. ConA belongs to the group with relatively high Ka and DH values, which have strong histamine-releasing activity. On the other hand, ConM belongs to the lower relatively Ka and DH values group, showing little histamine-releasing effect. Once the recognizing of the N-linked glycans is centered on the trimannoside core (Naismith and Field, 1996; Loris et al., 1996), which possesses Mana1-3Man as a highly specific ConA epitope, our results present a structural explanation regarding these affinity differences. Atomic coordinates for the structures discussed in this work were deposited in the PDB, with the following PDB access codes: CGL:M1-2M--2OVU ConM:M1-2M--2OW4, CGL:M1-3M--2EF6 ConM:M1-3M--2P37, CGL:M1-4M--2P2K ConM:M1-4M--2P34.
