Abstract Two open reading frames in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome, Rv3372 and Rv2006, have about 25% sequence identity at the amino acid level to the trehalose-phosphate phosphatase (TPP) purified from Mycobacterium smegmatis. However, the protein produced from the cloned Rv3372 gene has a molecular weight of about 45 kDa whereas the trehalose-P phosphatase purified from M. smegmatis has a molecular weight of about 27 kDa. We expressed the Rv3372 protein in Escherichia coli and show here that it is a trehalose-P phosphatase with very similar properties to the M. smegmatis TPP, i.e., complete specificity for trehalose-phosphate as the substrate, an almost absolute requirement for Mg2þ , and a pH optimum of 7­7.5. On the other hand, in contrast to the M. smegmatis enzyme, the Rv3372 protein was much less stable to heat and much less sensitive to inhibition by diumycin and moenomycin. In fact, both of these antibiotics stimulate enzyme activity at low concentrations and only inhibit the activity at higher antibiotic concentrations. Antibody prepared against the 27 kDa TPP does not cross react with the 45 kDa TPP nor does antibody against the 45 kDa TPP cross react with the 27 kDa TPP. Nevertheless, studies of secondary structure by circular dichroism indicate that the two enzymes are quite similar in structure. The product of the other gene, Rv2006, is a 159 kDa protein with no detectable phosphatase activity. Thus, its function is currently unknown. Ó 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Trehalose is an a,a-1,1-linked disaccharide of D -glucose which is synthesized and utilized by many different organisms including bacteria, yeast, fungi, higher plants, insects, and lower invertebrates [1]. This disaccharide appears to serve a number of diverse functions. For example, in fungi and insects, trehalose serves as a storehouse of glucose for energy and a source of carbon for spore germination [1], whereas in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other organisms, it was also shown to function as a stabilizer or protectant of proteins and membranes against various stress conditions [2]. In mycobacteria and corynebacteria, trehalose also plays a structural role as a key component of a number of cell

wall glycolipids, where it occurs acylated with various types of fatty acids, as well as other substitutions [3]. Trehalose may also function in these cells in other capacities such as in a signaling role. Since trehalose is not required by, or synthesized in, any mammalian cells, but appears to be essential for mycobacteria and other microorganisms, the reactions involved in the biosynthesis of trehalose represent excellent potential target sites for chemotherapy against tuberculosis and other bacterial diseases. Therefore, understanding the catalytic mechanisms of the enzymes involved in trehalose formation, and the properties of these proteins, is critical information for the development of new antimycobacterial drugs. There are at least three different pathways that can give rise to trehalose. The most widely reported pathway involves two enzymes called trehalose-phosphate

synthase (TPS here, or OtsA in Escherichia coli)2 and trehalose-phosphate phosphatase (TPP here, or OtsB in E. coli). TPS catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to glucose-6-phosphate to give trehalose6-phosphate and UDP [4,5]. TPP then removes the phosphate to produce free trehalose [6]. This pathway has been demonstrated in many bacteria, yeast, fungi, insects, silk worms, and plants [7]. There are several other pathways that have been identified in certain bacteria that give rise to trehalose, but not trehalosephosphate, from either maltose [8] or glycogen [9]. Several open reading frames in the mycobacterial genome bear significant identity to the genes coding for enzymes in these pathways [10]. These pathways and their potential relation to other trehalose metabolic pathways are presented in the discussion. TPP is one potential target site for drug intervention. This enzyme was initially purified from cytosolic extracts of Mycobacterium smegmatis to give a homogeneous 27 kDa protein that was specific for trehalosephosphate as the substrate, and had a pH optimum of about 7­7.5, and a requirement for Mg2þ . The gene for this protein was identified in the M. smegmatis genome and was cloned and expressed in E. coli with a His6 tag at the amino terminus [11]. Based on the amino acid sequence of this protein, we identified two open reading frames (ORFs), Rv3372 and Rv2006, in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome that had about 25% sequence identity at the amino acid level. In this manuscript, we show that the 45 kDa protein translated from the gene, Rv3372, is a trehalose-phosphate phosphatase, and we compare the properties of this protein to those of the TPP initially purified from M. smegmatis. The function of the protein produced from the gene, Rv2006, is not known.

routinely cultured in the presence of 10 lg/ml tetracycline to maintain carriage of the F episome. E. coli strains were cultured in L broth and on L agar supplemented with 100 lg/ml ampicillin, 20 lg/ml kanamycin or 10 lg/ml tetracycline, individually or in combination, where applicable. All bacterial strains were cultured at 37 °C. A 1.5 kb region of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome containing the putative TPP ORF was amplified from M. tuberculosis genomic DNA by PCR using oligonucleotide primers 3372HisFP 50 -GTG AGA GGG TGG CAT ATG CGC AAG TTG GGC-30 and 3372HisRP 50 -GCC GCG TCT CGA GAT CTC TGG CAG CAC-30 . The forward primer, 3372 HisFP, corresponds to nucleotides 3786295­3786324 of the M. tuberculosis genome sequence, and the reverse primer 3372HisRP is complementary to nucleotides 3787708­3787682 of the M. tuberculosis contig. To generate an upstream NdeI site and downstream BglII site, a few nucleotides were altered (as indicated by the underlined nucleotides), and the start codon of the 3372 is represented by a bold ``A.'' The PCR amplification was done at 2 mM MgCl2 concentration by using the Takara LA PCR kit with a 68 °C annealing temperature. The resulting 1.5 kb PCR product was digested with NdeI and BglII and ligated to the expression vector pET15b (Novagen), which had been linearized with NdeI and BamHI. This generated the recombinant plasmid, p3372His. The fidelity of the amplified product was confirmed by sequencing the entire cloned (His)6 -otsB2 gene fusion. p3372His was transformed in E. coli strain HMS-F and the ampicillin and tetracycline transformants were selected and cultured with and without IPTG.

Experimental methods Bacterial strains, culture conditions, and cloning methodology The E. coli strains DH5a and HMS-F [12] were used for cloning and expression studies, respectively. HMS-F is a derivative of the expression strain HMS174 (DE-3) (Novagen) and contains a chromosomal IPTG-inducible T7 RNA pol gene. HMS-F contains an additional copy of the lac repressor lacIq on an F episome, which was transferred from the E. coli cloning strain XL-1 (Stratagene). This addition effectively represses expression from the T7 promoter on the E. coli expression vector pET15b (Novagen) in the absence of IPTG. HMS-F was

of the (His)6 -otsB2 polypeptide (45 kDa) was confirmed by SDS­PAGE (see Fig. 1). Reagents and materials Trehalose-phosphate, buffers, DEAE­cellulose, and other chromatographic resins and materials were from Sigma Chemical. Sephadex G-75 and all electrophoresis materials were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Except where otherwise specified, all DNA manipulation enzymes, including restriction endonucleases, polymerases, and ligase, were supplied by New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and used according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. Custom oligonucleotide primers were commercially synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). PCR reagents were supplied by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). All other reagents were from reliable chemical companies and were of the best grade available. Assay of the trehalose-phosphate phosphatase

European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI; www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/). Basic sequence analysis, including identification of restriction sites, translations, and DNA sequence alignments, was performed using the ``Genejockey'' program (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Circular dichroism measurements To determine secondary structure elements of the recombinant TPP, far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a Jasco Model 715 spectrophotometer. A protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ ml in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was used. The reported spectra were the average of five scans, which were smoothed and corrected for buffer blanks. CD data were expressed as mean residue molar ellipticity with 115 as the mean residue molecular weight. Secondary structure parameters were estimated by the computer programs PROSEC derived by Yang et al. [13].

Results The enzymatic activity of TPP was determined by measuring the release of inorganic phosphate from trehalose-6-P, or other sugar phosphates. Briefly, the assay was done in a final volume of 100 lls, containing the following components: 2 mM trehalose-6-P (or other phosphorylated compounds), 2 mM MgCl2 , 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and an appropriate amount of enzyme. After an incubation at 37 °C of 1­15 min, 2 volumes of a filtered solution containing 0.15% malachite green, 1% ammonium molybdate, and 4.5% HCl was added to the incubation, and the mixture was allowed to incubate for an additional 2 min to allow for development of color. The absorbance of the mixture was read at 630 nm and compared to that of a standard solution of inorganic phosphate treated in the same manner [6,11]. Other methods Protein was measured with the Bio-Rad reagent using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The molecular weight of the M. tuberculosis TPP was estimated by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300, as well as by SDS­PAGE. Molecular weight standards included b-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12 kDa). Sequence analysis Open reading frames (ORFs) RV3372 and Rv2006 were identified by BLASTP alignment with predicted amino acid sequences on GenBank. Multiple amino acid alignments were performed using on line CLUSTALW alignment program at a web site maintained by the Cloning and sequencing of M. tuberculosis TPP Based on the amino acid sequence of the 27 kDa TPP purified from M. smegmatis (MS-TPP), we identified two ORFs in the M. tuberculosis genome that had 25% sequence identity at the amino acid level. These two ORFs are Rv3372 (otsB2 gene) and Rv2006 (otsB gene). ORF Rv3372 is annotated in the GenBank database as a ``possible trehalose-phosphate phosphatase.'' The 1175 bp ORF is located at nucleotides 3786310­3787485 of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome, and potentially encodes a protein of 391 amino acid residues with an expected molecular weight of about 45 kDa. BLASTP analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of Rv3372 shows homology with a number of proposed phosphatases, e.g., Mycobacterium leprae (64% identity and 72% similarity) and Mycobacterium avium (39% identity and 49% similarity), but only about 25% identity with the Rv2006 product, i.e., otsB, of M. tuberculosis. However, otsB and otsB2 of M. tuberculosis do share a 260 amino acid core region which is closely related to otsB of E. coli, and to a core region of TPS2 of S. cerevisiae. Purification and identification of the Rv3372 gene product The E. coli expression strain HMS-F, transformed with the Rv3372 gene, was grown on a rotary shaker at 28 °C in LB medium containing 100 lg/ml ampicillin to an optical density of 0.6. At that point, 0.1 mM IPTG was added and the cells were incubated for an additional 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with buffer, and subjected to sonication. The crude sonicate,

253

as well as the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) and pellet (membranes) fractions from a high-speed centrifugation, was tested for TPP activity that was not susceptible to inhibition by NaF. About 50% of the enzymatic activity in the crude sonicate was found in the membrane fraction, but almost all of this activity was solubilized in the presence of 0.2% Sarkosyl, and the TPP activity was then found in the supernatant fraction after centrifugation. Thus, crude extracts of HMS-F were adjusted to a final concentration of 0.1% Sarkosyl and allowed to remain on ice for 10 or 15 min before being subjected to high-speed centrifugation. The cytosolic fraction was then collected and used for isolation and purification of the TPP. The crude extract was applied to a nickel ion column and after thorough washing of the column with 10 mM imidazole, the column was washed with 20 mM imidazole and then with 250 mM imidazole. Fig. 1 shows the protein profiles obtained with each of these treatments. In the absence of IPTG induction, only a small amount of a 45 kDa band was detected in the crude extract (data not shown), whereas in the presence of IPTG induction, a major band was observed at about 45 kDa (lane 1). Lane 2 shows that this 45 kDa band was not found in the flow through fraction from the nickel column, nor was it present in the 10 mM imidazole wash of the column (lane 3), indicating that it had bound to the column. However, as shown in lane 4, TPP was partially removed when the column was eluted with 20 mM imidazole, and was completely eluted from the column with 250 mM imidazole (lane 5). The protein in the 250 mM imidazole elution was used for the remainder of the studies described here. Enzymatic properties of protein produced from Rv3372 The enzyme (MT-TPP) that eluted from the nickel ion column was run on a gel filtration column to remove imidazole and phosphate buffer and the column was eluted with 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5. This enzyme preparation was characterized in terms of substrate specificity, pH optima, metal ion requirements, effects of inhibitors, and physical properties of the protein. Since this gene product (MT-TPP) was annotated as a trehalose-P phosphatase, it was expected to have properties like those of the MS-TPP. Therefore, we first examined the substrate specificity of this enzyme. The purified protein was incubated with a number of different sugar phosphates in the presence of 3 mM MgCl2 , and the release of inorganic phosphate was measured. Table 1 demonstrates that the enzyme has very strong phosphatase activity against trehalose-P, but very little activity towards any other sugar phosphates, or towards q-nitrophenyl-phosphate. The slight activity detected with the sugar phosphates, glucose-1-P, and mannose-1P, is probably due to nonenzymatic release of phosphate from these substrates either during the incubation, or

due to storage of the substrates, since control incubations with heat-killed enzyme showed similar levels of free inorganic phosphate. The effect of trehalose-phosphate concentration on the rate of the reaction was measured using the same incubation mixtures as described in the text, but with the amount of trehalose-P in each incubation mixture increased to reach a final concentration of 5 mM. The reaction rate was found to be proportional to the concentration of substrate up to about 2­3 mM, and the Km for trehalose-P was calculated to be about 1.2 mM (data not shown). The Km for trehalose-P previously determined for the MS-TPP was about 1.6 mM [11]. The pH optimum of the MT-TPP was also determined as demonstrated in Fig. 2. In this experiment, acetate buffer (at 100 mM) was used from pH 4 to 5.5, Tris­maleate (100 mM) buffer from pH 6 to 7, and Tris­HCl (100 mM) from 7 to 9. Three separate experiments generated almost identical pH profiles with maximal enzyme activity with trehalose-P occurring at a pH of about 7.5. This is the same pH optimum obtained with the MS-TPP. The enzyme showed almost no activity at either acid pH (5.0) or at alkaline pH (9.0), in contrast to reported pH optima of many nonspecific acid or alkaline phosphatases that do show maximum activity at either pH 5 or pH 9. MT-TPP showed an almost absolute requirement for Mg2þ for activity as demonstrated in Fig. 3. The optimum concentration of this metal ion was about 1 mM. The results also indicate that Mn2þ could not replace the requirement for Mg2þ with the MT-TPP, although it was somewhat effective in replacing Mg2þ with the MSTPP. Furthermore, no other metal ions could be substituted for Mg2þ with the MT-TPP. The enzyme from M. smegmatis also was most active with Mg2þ and the optimum concentration with this metal ion was about 1­2 mM. Physical properties of the TPP from M. tuberculosis TPP was subjected to far-UV CD measurements as described in the Experimental methods section. A

summary of these data is given in Table 2 and is compared to similar measurements made on the MS-TPP. Both proteins were quite similar in terms of the amount of a-helix and b-pleated sheet, indicating that secondary structure could not explain the differences in heat stability and resistance to antibiotic sensitivity. Polyclonal antibody against the 27 kDa protein from M. smegmatis did not react with the 45 kDa protein on SDS gels or by Western blotting, nor did the antibody made with the 45 kDa M. tuberculosis protein cross react with the 27 kDa protein (data not shown).
Fig. 2. Effect of pH of the incubation mixture on the activity of M. tuberculosis TPP. Incubation mixtures were as described in the text but contained buffers at various pH values as shown in the figure. Acetate buffer was used from pH 4.5 to 5.6, Tris­maleate buffer from 6.0 to 7.0, and Tris­HCl buffer from 7.0 to 9.0. Enzyme activity was measured by the release of inorganic phosphate as described under ``Experimental methods.'' The results shown are the average of three different experiments. Each point did not deviate more than 5% from one experiment to the next.

Stability of the M. tuberculosis TPP The enzyme from M. tuberculosis was compared to the MS-TPP in terms of their ability to withstand temperatures of 50 or 60 °C. Fig. 4 shows that the MT-TPP lost almost all of its activity in 1 min at 60 °C, whereas MS-TPP retained most of its activity even after 5 min at

this temperature. On the other hand, both enzymes were fairly stable at 50 °C for at least 5 min. Thus, the larger enzyme (MT-TPP) is significantly less heat stable than the MS-TPP. Inhibition of MT-TPP activity This phosphatase, like the MS-TPP, is not inhibited by sodium fluoride or sodium orthovanadate at up to 40 mM concentrations, in contrast to many other phosphatases that are sensitive to these inhibitors. It is, however, susceptible to inhibition by the antibiotics diumycin and moenomycin, as is MS-TPP. However, the inhibition of MT-TPP required at least 4 to 5 times as much antibiotic as MS-TPP. As shown in Fig. 5, diumycin and moenomycin stimulated MT-TPP activity at concentrations of up to 100 lg/ml, and then inhibited at higher concentrations, whereas the MS-TPP was almost completely inhibited at 50 lg/ml. Thus, these two trehalose-P phosphatases have very similar enzymatic

activities but differ significantly in their sensitivity to heat and in their susceptibility to the antibiotics diumycin and moenomycin.

Discussion Trehalose is a very versatile molecule and can apparently serve in a number of different capacities in cells. For example, it is a major component of a number of glycolipids that are present in the cell walls of various mycobacteria, such as M. tuberculosis. In this organism, trehalose-dimycolate, also known as cord factor, is an important structural component [14] and may also be the donor of mycolic acids to produce mycolyl-arabinogalactan, an important cell wall polymer [15]. These various trehalose-lipids apparently provide a protective barrier to the cell that prevents the penetration of many antibiotics and other toxic drugs [16,17]. There is also increasing evidence from studies in yeast and some other organisms that trehalose may function in a protective role to prevent denaturation of proteins and/or damage to membranes as a result of various stress conditions, such as heat [18], desiccation [19], dehydration [20], cold [21] or oxidation [22]. It is possible that cytoplasmic trehalose could also play a similar role in M. tuberculosis and other mycobacteria, and allow these organisms to survive latency in macrophages, or protect them during other stress conditions. However, such a role for trehalose has not yet been demonstrated. Trehalose has also been shown to provide a source of energy for insect flight [23], and is proposed to provide a source of carbon for developing organisms [24]. These different roles for trehalose in a variety of organisms strongly indicate that this sugar is important, if not essential, to many living organisms, including mycobacteria. Additional support for this hypothesis is provided by the finding that there are at least 3, and possibly 4, different biosynthetic pathways to produce trehalose. In some organisms, several of these pathways are active at the same time, and studies by De Smet et al. [10] as well as studies in our laboratory have demonstrated at least three different pathways do exist and are active in M. smegmatis. The most widespread of the biosynthetic pathways for producing trehalose involves a glucosyltransferase, referred to as trehalose-phosphate synthase (TPS), which transfers glucose from UDP-glucose to glucose-6phosphate to form trehalose-6-phosphate and UDP [4,5,7]. As indicated above, this enzyme has been detected in a wide variety of organisms, and the TPS gene from M. tuberculosis has been expressed in E. coli to produce active enzyme whose properties have been determined [25]. This pathway also involves a highly specific phosphatase that removes the phosphate from trehalose-6-phosphate to give free trehalose [6,11]. The

Incubations were as described in the text except that various amounts of diumycin or moenomycin were added as indicated in the figure. Inhibitors were added after the substrates, buffer and metal ions, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme. MT-TPP (open squares for moenomycin; closed for diumycin) was stimulated at low concentrations of either antibiotic and inhibited at higher concentrations whereas MS-TPP was strongly inhibited by both (open triangles for moenomycin; closed triangles for diumycin).

properties of that enzyme (MT-TPP) from M. tuberculosis are the subject of this paper. A second pathway involves a single enzyme, called trehalose synthase, that catalyzes the intramolecular rearrangement of maltose to convert the a-1,4-glycosidic bond to the a,a-1,1linkage of trehalose [8]. An ORF in the M. tuberculosis genome shares about 40% homology with the trehalose synthase gene from Pimelobacter species [8]. We have recently purified this trehalose synthase from cytosolic extracts of M. smegmatis, demonstrating that this pathway is also present and expressed in this organism [26]. A third pathway of trehalose formation that is present in Sulfolobus species [27] and Arthrobacter species [28] involves two enzymes; the first enzyme called maltooligosyltrehalose synthase rearranges the glucose at the reducing end of a maltooligosaccharide to convert the a1,4 linkage to an a,a-1,1-linkage and the second, called maltooligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase, cleaves off the trehalose from the reducing end to give free trehalose and a maltooligosaccharide that is two glucose units shorter. We have recently found enzymatic evidence for this pathway in M. smegmatis and are pursuing purification of the enzymes involved [29]. A fourth possible pathway for the synthesis of trehalose is the trehalose phosphorylase which was initially purified from Euglena [30] but has also been found in mushrooms [31] and various bacteria, including actinomycetes [32]. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible reaction of glucose-1-phosphate and glucose to give trehalose and inorganic phosphate. In some organisms, several or even all of these pathways may be present. For example, mycobacteria appear to have active enzymes for at least three of these pathways [10], suggesting that trehalose is an essential metabolite in these organisms. The question to be addressed is whether each of these pathways has a separate role or whether all can provide trehalose for its various functions. That is, does one pathway provide the trehalose for formation of cell wall glycolipids, and another the trehalose for stabilizing cellular membranes or proteins? The solution to this dilemma will be to determine the levels of the various trehalose pools in cells that have had each of the pathways knocked out. Thus if one of the pathways provides trehalose that is essential for cell wall integrity, that might be the key pathway to focus on as a target site for chemotherapy. One likely target site for drug intervention in tuberculosis or other mycobacterial diseases is the trehalosephosphate synthase pathway since this may be the major pathway in these organisms. Thus, either the synthase (TPS) or the phosphatase (TPP) should be an excellent site for chemotherapy. We recently reported on the purification and characterization of the TPP of M. smegmatis. This 27 kDa protein was sequenced and the gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli [11]. Based on our amino acid sequence data on this protein, we iden-

tified two open reading frames (ORFs) in the M. tuberculosis genome (Rv3372 and Rv2006) which have about 25% identity. Rv3372 has been annotated in the GenBank database as a possible trehalose-P phosphatase. The studies described here demonstrate that this gene does code for a highly specific TPP which has a number of properties similar to those of the TPP from M. smegmatis. However, the MT-TTP is a 45 kDa protein whereas the MS-TPP is only a 27 kDa protein. Both proteins require Mg2þ for activity, both have a pH optimum at about 7.0­7.5, and both are highly specific for trehalose-phosphate as the substrate. These two enzymes are also inhibited by the antibiotics, diumycin and moenomycin, but the MT-TPP enzymatic activity is stimulated at low concentrations (up to 100 lg/ml) of these two drugs and only inhibited at higher concentrations, whereas MS-TPP is almost completely inhibited at 100 lg/ml. Earlier studies in our laboratory demonstrated that both diumycin and moenomycin inhibited the growth of M. smegmatis, with about 50% inhibition occurring at about 6­8 lg of antibiotic/ml [33]. The mechanism of inhibition by these two antibiotics is unknown although some earlier studies by others had suggested that they might inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis. A second major difference between these two proteins is the heat stability. MS-TPP is fairly stable at 60 °C for up to 5 min, whereas MT-TPP is almost completely inactivated in 1 min at this temperature. Both, however, are fairly stable at 50 ° for about 5 min. Why are these two phosphatases with identical functions and produced by related organisms, so different in size and sequence? MT-TPP and MS-TPP share 25% identity at the amino acid sequence level, and this identity is concentrated at the carboxy terminal in each case. Does the other 20 kDa portion of the MTTPP protein have some additional function or some regulatory aspect not shared by the MS-TPP? At this time we cannot answer this question or provide an explanation of the reason for the difference in size and sequence between these two functionally related proteins. Interestingly enough, the TPS from M. smegmatis and that from M. tuberculosis (or M. leprae, or M. avium) share about 75­80% identity at the amino acid level. These data suggest that these organisms are closely related. Despite their identical function, the absence of DNA sequence homology and the different locations on their respective chromosomes suggest that MT-TPP and MSTPP are not homologs. The significance of this difference is unclear. One possible, and highly speculative, explanation is that at some point in its evolution, M. tuberculosis lost its otsB homolog, and that another sugar phosphate phosphatase (Rv3372) evolved to mediate the generation of trehalose from trehalose-phosphate.
