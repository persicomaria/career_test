Creatine kinase (CK) catalyses the reversible transfer of the phosphate moiety from phosphocreatine (PCr) to ADP, generating creatine and ATP. The crystal structure of a Ê cytosolic brain-type creatine kinase is reported at 2.3 A. The biological dimer sits on a crystallographic twofold axis. The N-terminal residues of both subunits come very close to the crystallographic twofold at the dimer interface. The electron density observed is consistent with two alternative conformations for the N-termini, as previously found for chicken braintype creatine kinase.

1. Introduction
Members of the family of structurally and functionally related ATP:guanidino phosphotransferases (Lehninger, 1992; Watts, 1971) reversibly catalyse the transfer of phosphate between ATP and various phosphagens, thereby maintaining constant levels of ATP in the cell. Creatine kinase (CK; E.C. 2.7.3.2) is a member of this enzyme class and catalyses the reversible phosphoryl-transfer reaction between phosphocreatine (PCr) and ADP. Most invertebrates have arginine kinase (AK) as their sole guanidino kinase (Watts, 1971; Ellington, 1989). This enzyme performs a similar function to creatine kinase in that it produces high-energy phosphagens (phosphoarginine; PAr) for use in energy-requiring processes, PCr  Mg-ADP  H 6 Cr  Mg-ATP PAr  Mg-ADP  H 6 Ar  Mg-ATPX Four isoforms of creatine kinase exist which are categorized by their sub-cellular localization (Eppenberger et al., 1967; Jacobus & Lehninger, 1973). There are two cytosolic isoforms, brain type (B) and muscle type (M), which can form homodimers or heterodimers (MM, BB, MB). The two mitochondrial isoforms, a striated muscle-speci®c isoform (Mib-CK; b for basic) and a so-called `ubiquitous' isoform (Mia-CK; a for acidic), are located exclusively in the intermembrane compartment of the mitochondria (DeLuca & Hall, 1980). These mitochondrial isoforms form octamers comprised of four stable dimers (Schlegel et al., 1988; Belousova et al., 1991). Sequence analysis of the guanidino kinase family shows a highly conserved protein family (Muhlebach et al., 1994). Members of the cytosolic CKs exhibit 77±82% sequence identity and the mitochondrial isoforms show 82±85% sequence identity. Cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms show 60±66% sequence identity, while a comparison of CK and AK sequences shows 38±44% identity. Sequence analysis of CK isoforms has identi®ed six highly conserved regions ¯anked by

de®nitive identi®cation of residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis. Arginine kinase and creatine kinase both perform the same function, reversible phosphoryl transfer. Both enzymes utilize adenine nucleotides (ATP/ADP) and the phosphoryl acceptors only differ slightly (Cr/PCr and Ar/PAr). Owing to the sequence and functional similarities of the arginine and creatine kinases, the structure of hc-AK provides a template from which those residues are likely to form the nucleotide and creatine-binding sites can be identi®ed. The amino-acid differences between hc-AK and brB-CK localized at the active site complement the different substrate speci®cities of the two guanidino kinases.

seven more variable sections. These six conserved regions are collectively termed the `CK framework' and are responsible for basic enzyme function. The more variable regions are believed to be involved in isoenzyme-speci®c functions such as oligomerization (Hossle et al., 1988). Both mitochondrial and cytosolic CK isoforms are functionally coupled to sites of energy utilization and production (Wallimann et al., 1984; Wegmann et al., 1992). The close association of Mi-CK, porin and adenine nucleotide translocase (Beutner et al., 1996) might provide direct access for Mi-CK to mitochondrial matrix-generated ATP. This protein complex also provides a route for Mi-CK generated PCr into the cytosol. The shuttling of PCr from the mitochondria into the cytosol is the basis of the phosphocreatine circuit/shuttle. This provides a mechanism of energy homeostasis in which both mitochondrial and cytosolic CK isoforms play a pivotal role (Wallimann et al., 1992). Although the CK family has been subjected to extensive biochemical investigation, a de®nitive mechanism of phosphoryl transfer has yet to be elucidated. Small-angle scattering studies (Forstner et al., 1996) using dimeric rabbit muscle creatine kinase identi®ed a large reduction in the radius of Ê gyration (28.0±25.5 A) upon substrate binding, suggesting a substantial degree of conformational change. Several residues and peptide regions have been implicated in catalysis. For example, lysine and arginine residues have been proposed to interact with the negatively charged phosphate groups of ADP/ATP (Bose & Friedberg, 1971; James & Cohn, 1974; Borders & Riordan, 1975; Wood et al., 1998). A tryptophan residue is suspected to form a stack with the adenine base moiety (Vasak et al., 1979; Gross et al., 1994). The highly conserved cysteine (Cys283) has also been implicated in catalysis, as chemical modi®cation with a variety of reagents leads to full or partial inactivation of the enzyme (Watts, 1973; Buechter et al., 1992). More recently, the role of the conserved cysteine was proposed to function more in the synergism of substrate binding than directly in catalysis (Furter et al., 1993). Only when the X-ray structures became available did a comparison of the cytosolic isoenzymes (Rao et al., 1998; Eder et al., 1999) with structures of octameric mitochondrial CK isoforms (Fritz-Wolf et al., 1996; Eder et al., 2000) and horseshoe crab arginine kinase (hc-AK) complexed with a transition-state analogue (Zhou et al., 1998) allow a more

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Purification and crystallization

Bovine retinal brain-type creatine kinase (brB-CK) was puri®ed from bovine photoreceptor cells and crystallized as described by Loew & Bax (1998). Crystals were also grown at a higher temperature (293 rather than 277 K); attempts to grow crystals of a transition-state complex of brB-CK have not to date been successful.
2.2. Data collection and processing

Ê The collection of a 2.7 A data set on a MAR Research imaging plate mounted on a GX-21 rotating-anode generator has been described (Loew & Bax, 1998); the images of this Ê 2.7 A data set were reprocessed with DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) to give data set A (Table 1). Data set B, Ê extending to higher resolution (2.3 A), was subsequently collected from a single unfrozen crystal on station 9.5 at the Ê SRS, Daresbury. The 2.7 A data set did not scale well with the Ê 2.3 A data set; there were small differences in unit-cell parameters. Frozen crystals (frozen from a cryosolution of 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2.4 M ammonium sulfate, 25% glycerol) typically have very high mosaic spread and have not to date yielded good quality data.
2.3. Structure determination

The structure was determined by molecular replacement Ê using the 2.7 A data set (data set A; prior to the collection of data set B). The search model was subunit A from the structure of octameric chicken mitochondrial creatine kinase (Mib-CK; PDB code 1crk; Fritz-Wolf et al., 1996). The percentage sequence identity between the amino-acid sequences of brB-CK and Mib-CK is 65% and this, together with the fact that there is only a single subunit of brB-CK in the asymmetric unit, made the molecular replacement straightforward. The rotation and translation functions were determined with AMoRe (Navaza & Saludjian, 1997) as implemented in the CCP4 suite of programs (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The rotation funcÊ tion calculated with data between 15 and 3.5 A yielded a clear solution (height 19.30', compared with a ®rst noise peak of

9.95'). Translation functions were calculated in both P43212 and P41212; a clear solution was obtained in P43212 with a correlation coef®cient of 58.5 (38.9) and an R factor of 43.5% (51.7%) (numbers in parentheses are the correlation coef®cient and R factor of the ®rst noise peak). In comparison, in P41212 the highest peak had a correlation coef®cient of 30.1 (27.3) and an R factor of 49.3% (50.5%), clearly indicating that the correct space group was P43212.
Ê 2.4. Refinement against the 2.7 A data set 2.6. Unexplained density on the twofold axis of the creatine kinase dimer

The chicken creatine kinase subunit was positioned in the P43212 cell of the brB-CK crystal by rotating it and translating it with PDBSET (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) as indicated by the molecular-replacement solution. In an initial round of re®nement with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998), the model was ®rst subjected to 40 cycles of rigidbody re®nement as a single subunit and to the re®nement of an overall temperature factor. This initial re®nement was followed by re®nement of the protein as two rigid bodies corresponding to the two domains (residues 1±112 and 113±380) identi®ed by Fritz-Wolf et al. (1996). This reduced the R factor and free R factor to 36.9 and 39.1%, respectively. Five rounds of rebuilding with the computer graphics program O (Jones et al., 1991) then followed, followed by re®nement with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). Each re®nement round included bulk-solvent scaling, anisotropic temperature-factor re®nement and 120 cycles of restrained positional re®nement. In the ®rst round of rebuilding, side chains which differed between brB-CK and chicken Mib-CK were replaced and several regions with poor density were omitted. After ®ve rounds of rebuilding and re®nement, the R factor and free R factor had dropped to 21.8 and 28.3%, respectively. Extensive rebuilding had been carried out on several regions of the molecule (including residues 98±105, 300±330 and 365±380) and there was good 2Fo À Fc density for almost the entire Ê model. At this stage in the re®nement, the 2.3 A data set was introduced and re®nement was continued against this data set.
Ê 2.5. Refinement against the 2.3 A data set

Ê The brB-CK model from the 2.7 A re®nement was subject Ê to 50 cycles of rigid-body re®nement against the 2.3 A data set. Nine further cycles of rebuilding (with O) and re®nement (with CNS) reduced the R factor and Rfree to 21.5 and 28.0%, respcetively. Two prominent peaks of electron density in the active site were modelled as sulfate ions (1.9 M ammonium sulfate was present in the crystallization buffer). The model at this stage included two sulfates, 35 water molecules and residues 11±380 of creatine kinase. The density for all residues was reasonable, except for residues 320±329, which had weak density throughout the re®nement and appear to be largely disordered. Density close to Cys283 (near the active site) was not well modelled as a water molecule and suggested the presence of a covalent adduct on the cysteine. This was modelled as a thioester-linked creatine attached to the cysteine.

Cytosolic creatine kinases, such as brB-CK, are dimeric. In the crystal structure of brB-CK described here the creatine kinase dimer sits on a crystallographic twofold axis running along the ab diagonal of the cell. Throughout the re®nement of the structure of brB-CK we observed two prominent peaks (in Fo À Fc maps) on the crystallographic twofold axis relating the two subunits in the brB-CK dimer. There is other weaker density between Lys11 (the last residue for which we have unambiguous density) and these two prominent peaks of density on the twofold axis, suggesting that the N-termini of the two symmetry-related subunits in the dimer may lead in this direction. This density does not seem to be an artefact since it is present in both the Ê 2.7 and 2.3 A data sets and is not the function of a few re¯ections with large Fo À Fc differences. In order to try and interpret this density the following were performed. (i) Further rounds of re®nement were carried out with REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 1999) and CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). (ii) A cDNA coding for bovine brain-type creatine kinase was sequenced (see below) and as a consequence nine side chains were changed. (Note our previous interpretation had relied on amino-acid sequences of dog brain-type creatine kinase and human brain-type creatine kinase, which share some 97% identity with bovine brain-type creatine kinase). (iii) An automated re®nement procedure, ARP (Perrakis et al., 1999), was also used in a script which incorporated REFMAC to try and produce an unbiased map. (iv) When the coordinates of chicken cytosolic brain-type creatine kinase became available (Eder et al., 1999), we re-solved the structure by molecular replacement, con®rming our previous model. Furthermore, since chicken cytosolic brain-type creatine kinase crystallizes in P21 with two homodimers per asymmetric unit, we were able to extend our previously unsolved density on the crystallographic twofold by building alternate N-terminal conformations based on the chicken brain-type creatine kinase structure. It appears therefore that the most probable explanation for this extra density is that the N-terminus of each monomer has two conformations lying between the two subunits in the dimer. The observed density would thus be an average of two such N-termini per monomer, related by the crystallographic twofold axis, each with an occupancy of 0.5. The resulting N-termini of the creatine kinase dimer therefore occupy distinct but different conformations (similar to the N-termini observed in the recently reported structure of the cytosolic chicken brain-type creatine kinase; Eder et al., 1999).

2.7. Final coordinates

The ®nal coordinates consist of residues 12±381 (excluding residues 322±329, which are disordered), two sulfate ions with full occupancy (in the active site), alternate conformations for residues 2±11 with occupancy 0.5 (on the crystallographic twofold) and 65 waters. The R factor and Rfree are 18.6 and

2.9. Superposition of CK isoenzymes

Cloning of bovine brain-type creatine kinase was performed using a one-step room-temperature polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with poly(A)+ mRNA as a template. Brie¯y, 1 ng bovine retinal poly(A)+ mRNA (kindly provided by Dr Federico Gonzalez-Fernandez, University of Virginia, USA) was used in a TITAN one-tube RT-PCR reaction according to the manufacturer's suggestion (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The 5H -primer was designed based on a partial N-terminal protein sequence obtained by Edman degradation of a puri®ed brB-CK sample (5H -primer used in RT-PCR reaction: 5H -ATGCCCTTCTCCAACAG). The 3H -primer was generated by DNA-sequence alignments of all known brain-type creatine kinases and was positioned just downstream of the coding region within a highly conserved stretch (3H -primer used in RT-PCR reaction: 5H CCCTAGTTTATTTCAGCATCAGC). The RT-PCR reaction yielded a single product of the expected size, which was subsequently cloned into a TOPO-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Plasmid DNA of several independent colonies was analysed by automated DNA sequencing. The resulting DNA sequence yielded a single open reading frame of 1143 base pairs with a translated amino-acid sequence of 381 amino

Superpositions were performed using LSQMAN (Kleywegt, 1996) and O (Jones et al., 1991).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure of brB-CK subunit

The structure of the brB-CK subunit comprises two well de®ned domains (Fig. 1) with a fold very similar to previously solved structures of other CK isoenzymes (chicken mitochondrial Mi-CK; Fritz-Wolf et al., 1996; PDB code 1crk), cytosolic rabbit muscle-type rM-CK (Rao et al., 1998; PDB code 2crk), cytosolic chicken brain-type chB-CK (Eder et al., 1999; PDB code 1qh4), human ubiquitous mitochondrial CK (uMi-CK; Eder et al., 2000; PDB code 1qk1) and horseshoe crab arginine kinase hc-AK (Zhou et al., 1998; PDB code 1qk1). The small lobe consists of N-terminal helices 1±6 with their connecting loops and helix 9; the larger domain comprises an eight-stranded antiparallel -sheet enclosed by seven -helices. Helices 10 and 13 from the large domain are positioned on one side of the  sheet; helices 11, 12 and 13 cluster at one end of the -sheet and helices 7 and 8 at the opposite end.

Analysis of those residues previously implicated in substrate binding or catalysis identi®ed the location of the active site in a cleft between the large and small domains (Fritz-Wolf et al., 1996; Zhou et al., 2000; Eder et al., 1999). This is enclosed on one side by strands 1, 5 and 6 (large domain) and on the other side by the loop region Met70± Asp79 (small domain) connecting helices 4 and 5. The active-site cleft is formed by helices 9 and 6. Helix 9 is positioned away from the large domain towards the small domain by two long loop regions and we suggest this helix is really part of the small domain. Helix 6 of the small domain and its following loop region are angled away from the small domain towards the large domain and the subsequent loop connects the small domain to the large domain. Analysis of the electrostatic surface potential of the brB-CK monomer (Fig. 2) indicates a strongly positive region in the cleft between the two domains, which is likely to be the location of the nucleotide-binding site. Closer analysis of this region identi®ed a cluster of several arginine residues with side chains located close to or pointing into the active-site cleft. Further analysis of this arginine cluster during re®nement and rebuilding highlighted the presence of continuous density from the side chains of Arg130 and Arg320 to two regions of spherical density. Owing to the high concentration of ammonium sulfate present in the crystallization buffer, two sulfate groups were built into this density (Fig. 3).

loop region (Met207±Asp210) of the large domain of the second protomer. (iii) The loop region Met207±Asp210 from the large domain of protomer one interacts with helix 4 of the small domain from the second protomer. (iv) The N-terminal region of 7 from the large domain of protomer one interacts with 1 from the small domain of protomer two. Residues involved in bonding at the dimer interface are summarized in Table 2. Similar to the structure of cytosolic chicken brain-type creatine kinase (Eder et al., 1999), we also observe alternate conformations at the N-terminus of each molecule of the homodimer. This is the second case where different N-terminal conformations of a homodimeric cytosolic braintype creatine kinase have been found. However, it is still unclear if this feature is unique to brain-type CKs or is a general property of cytosolic creatine kinase, since in the structure of rabbit rM CK the N-terminus was disordered and was not included in the ®nal coordinates (Rao et al., 1998).
3.3. Comparison of brB-CK with other CK isoenzymes

Over the past few years several structures of CK isoenzymes have been made available and isoenzyme-speci®c structures can now be compared. As can be seen in the sequence alignment (Fig. 5), isoenzyme-speci®c sequence stretches are localized at the N-terminus, the linker region between the two domains, part of -helix 10, -helix 11 and 12 and at the C-terminus. With the exception of the N-terminus, the other

The cytosolic CK isoenzymes function as dimers, unlike the mitochondrial isoenzymes which exist as octamers. The crystal structure of brB-CK contains a dimer with two protomers related by a twofold rotation axis (Fig. 4). Four regions on each monomer contribute to the dimer interface (Fig. 4). (i) The N-terminal helix 1 forms several electrostatic interactions with the N-terminal end of helix 7 of the large domain from the second protomer. (ii) Residues of helix 4 (residues 54±62) of the small domain interact with a

Further comparison with the high-resolution chicken braintype structure (Eder et al., 1999) again con®rmed the presence of the cis proline bond at position 212. This cis proline appears to be conserved throughout all the CK isoenzymes and has also been found in the transition-state structure of arginine kinase (Zhou et al., 1998). In addition, as in the structure of chB-CK, the unusual backbone geometry of the highly conserved Glu231 is also preserved in brB-CK, suggesting a more prominent role for Glu231 in catalysis (Eder et al., 1999). The active site of creatine kinase contains a cluster of highly conserved arginines (Arg96, 130, 132, 135, 236, 292 and 320). Comparison with the previously solved structures of chicken mitochondrial CK (cMi-CK) complexed with ATP (Fritz-Wolf et al., 1996) and the transition-state structure of arginine kinase (Zhou et al., 1998) suggested these argiFigure 5 nines to be involved in binding of Alignment of sequences of bovine retinal brain-type creatine kinase (brB-CK), chicken mitochondrial CK (cMi-CK), human ubiquitous mitochondrial CK (uMi-CK), rabbit muscle CK (rM-CK), chicken the phosphate groups of the brain-type CK (chB-CK) and horseshoe crab arginine kinase (hc-AK). -Helices are represented as adenine nucleotide.

de®ned sulfate ions are present in the active site in the approximate position of the corresponding - and -phosphates of the nucleotides in the structures of cMi-CK and hc-AK. These sulfate ions appear to stabilize the conformations of the conserved arginines, leading to well ordered side chains. Both sulfates have also been observed at very similar positions in the structure of rabbit muscle-type CK (Rao et al., 1998). However, a third sulfate ion near the conserved Cys283 as observed in rM-CK is not present in the structure of brB-CK.

4. Summary
The maintenance of cellular energy levels is critical to the survival of all cells. Cells with ¯uctuating levels of ATP, such as muscle cells, are solely dependent on creatine kinase isoforms and the associated phosphocreatine shuttle system to synthesize ATP and maintain energy homeostasis. The crystal structure of the dimeric cytosolic isoform of bovine retinal brain-type creatine kinase has provided a further dimension to the investigation of the mechanism of catalysis of this critical enzyme as well as isoenzyme-speci®c differences. The authors would like to thank Dr Judith Murray-Rust for critical reading of the manuscript and Dr Anette Huebner for advice in cloning and sequencing of the bovine retinal creatine kinase gene.
