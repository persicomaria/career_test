Abstract The bacterially-expressed laccase, small laccase (SLAC) of Streptomyces coelicolor, was incorporated into electrodes of both direct electron transfer (DET) and mediated electron transfer (MET) designs for application in biofuel cells. Using the DET design, enzyme redox kinetics were directly observable using cyclic voltammetry, and a redox potential of 0.43 V (SHE) was observed. When mediated by an osmium redox polymer, the oxygen-reducing cathode retained maximum activity at pH 7, producing 1.5 mA/cm2 in a planar configuration at 900 rpm and 40  C, thus outperforming enzyme electrodes produced using laccase from fungal Trametes versicolor (0.2 mA/cm2 ) under similar conditions. This improvement is directly attributable to differences in the kinetics of SLAC and fungal laccases. Maximum stability of the mediated SLAC electrode was observed at pH above the enzyme's relatively high isoelectric point, where the anionic enzyme molecules could form an electrostatic adduct with the cationic mediator. Porous composite SLAC electrodes with increased surface area produced a current density of 6.25 mA/cm2 at 0.3 V (SHE) under the above conditions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The inherent catalytic capacity of enzymes holds great promise for use in portable, flexible, and inexpensive micropower sources able to refuel from ambient sources. Enzymatic biofuel cells could be designed to operate efficiently on any number of fuels, including ambient carbohydrates and macromolecules (Bullen et al., 2006; Davis and Higson, 2007; Calabrese Barton et al., 2004). The high selectivity of enzymes allow for the elimination of many of the seals and balance of plant components of a traditional fuel cell, simplifying the design to essentially an anode and cathode (Heller, 2004). For applications demanding operation at low temperature and mild pH, with extremely small device volume and footprint

and at a cost low enough to be disposable, enzymatic biofuel cells have many advantages over batteries or traditional fuel cells. The cathode of any ambient biofuel cell will make use of the four-electron reduction of dissolved or atmospheric dioxygen to water. The study of enzymatic cathodes has focused chiefly on the copper-containing oxidoreductases laccase and bilirubin oxidase, with important considerations being high redox potential, complete four-electron reaction, desired pH of operation, and insensitivity to interfering anions. Results have been reported for the fungal laccases from Coriolus hirsutus, Trametes versicolor, Coriolopsis gallica, and Pleurotus ostreatus, the tree laccase from Rhus vernicifera, and the fungal bilirubin oxidase from Myrothecium verrucaria (Mano et al., 2002; Calabrese Barton et al., 2002; Gupta et al., 2004; Tarasevich et al., 2001; Shleev et al., 2006). Enzymatic biofuel cells may be categorized in two types, based upon the method of electrical connection between the

enzyme and the current collector (Ghindilis et al., 1997; Heller, 1992). In direct electron transfer (DET) systems, the enzyme and current collector are in direct contact, and electrons pass from the electrode surface to the reducing substrate center of the enzyme. DET affords a simplicity of design and allows the use of the full thermodynamic potential of the enzyme, without introducing an overpotential for electron transfer from the enzyme to a mediator. In mediated electron transfer (MET), a redox-active molecule, whether organic or inorganic, is used to act as a reducing substrate and carry electrons from the electrode surface to the enzyme. MET generally offers a higher current density than DET if the system has been well-optimized and the appropriate mediator has been employed. However, the MET design introduces an additional level of complexity, and electrode performance becomes a matter of mediator integrity and stability, as well as stability of the enzyme itself. MET electrodes are often optimized on planar, glassy carbon rotating disk electrodes and then scaled to composite electrodes based on a porous carbon cloth matrix. Calabrese Barton et al. (2001) first reported carbon paper composite enzyme electrodes, using laccase of C. hirsutus and producing 5.0 mA/cm2 at 0.62 V (SHE) in 0.2 M pH 5 oxygen-saturated citrate buffer at 37  C and 1000 rpm. Mano et al. (2002) constructed a bilirubin oxidase cathode producing 4.5 mA/cm2 at 0.57 V (SHE) in oxygenated phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 at 37.5  C at 1000 rpm. Gallaway (2007) report a T. versicolor electrode resulting in 13 mA/cm2 at 0.53 V (SHE) in 0.1 M pH 4 oxygenated citrate buffer at 40  C and 900 rpm. All of these MET examples use a crosslinked osmium-based redox mediator, producing the appropriate redox potential for mediation and resulting in a stable electrode film construction. Several cathodes are also reported using a DET construction. Gupta et al. (2004) reported oxygen-reducing cathodes based on laccases from C. hirsutus and R. vernicifera on monolayermodified gold electrodes operating in pH 7 phosphate buffer. Lim et al. (2007) reported bilirubin oxidase electrodes on silica sol­gel/carbon nanotube composite electrodes resulting in 140 A/cm2 at 25  C in quiescent, oxygen-saturated PBS. Kamitaka et al. (2007) constructed a cathode on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) with a Trametes laccase, getting 170 A/cm2 under oxygen in pH 5 buffer at 25  C. Tsujimura et al. (2005) have reported bilirubin oxidase-based electrodes in a poly-l-lysine matrix, characterized as DET-like with a diffusing enzyme, which result in 0.85 mA/cm2 in oxygen-saturated pH 7 phosphate buffer, rotating at 1400 rpm. Electrodes based on bacterial enzymes appear only seldom in the literature. Miura et al. (2007) constructed a DET electrode on HOPG using copper efflux oxidase (CueO) from E. coli, with the enzyme free in solution at pH 5 and 25  C. The result is 3.7 mA/cm2 catalytic current, although the stability and versatility of construction for a non-diffusing version is unclear. Such use of a bacterial enzyme may be desirable, as heterologous expression of recombinant proteins in bacteria is facile, and the resulting proteins are non-glycosylated, which may facilitate electron transfer. In the present work, we report the evaluation of a bacteriallyexpressed laccase, small laccase (SLAC) of Streptomyces

coelicolor, using both MET and DET-type electrode schemes. Solution phase results are compared to enzyme electrode performance, and electrochemical polarization results are interpreted to identify rate-limiting steps. This laccase was previously reported to be highly active at pH 7, displaying the same specificity to oxygen and non-specificity to the reducing substrate as other laccases, making it an ideal candidate for enzyme bioelectrocatalysis (Machczynski et al., 2004). Here we show that a current density approaching 7 mA/cm2 can be obtained in a porous composite electrode, the highest reported current density for enzymatic oxygen reduction at neutral pH. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Ultrapure O2 , air, N2 , and argon were purchased from Tech Air (White Plains, NY). Laccase from Trametes versicolor was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Vinylimidazole, potassium hexachloroosmiate, 2,2 -bipyridyl (bpy), 4,4 -dimethyl-2,2 -bipyridine (dm-bpy), sodium dithionite, glutaraldehyde, citric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium hydroxide, hydrochloric acid, ethanol, dimethylformamide, and ether were purchased from Fisher Chemical (Fair Lawn, NJ) and used without purification. Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) was purchased from Fisher Chemical and recrystallized from methanol prior to use. Single-walled carbon nanotube powder (CNT) and 5% Nafion solution in alcohol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The plasmid pSLAC encoding the small laccase gene from isolated from Streptomyces coelicolor was a kind gift from Gerard Canters (Leiden University, Netherlands). 2.2. Enzyme expression and purification Laccase from Trametes versicolor was purified using a DEAE Sephacel resin as reported previously (Hudak and Calabrese Barton, 2005). SLAC was expressed as previously described (Machczynski et al., 2004). Briefly, 1 L of 2×YT media was inoculated with mature E. coli (BL21) culture harboring the pSLAC expression plasmid. The culture was grown to an OD600 of 1.5 at 30  C prior to induction with 0.4 mM IPTG. Expression continued for 20 h at 25  C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and soluble protein was released from re-suspended cell pellets (10 mM phosphate, pH 7.3) by sonication. Prior to purification, the crude lysate was incubated with 1 mM of CuSO4 for several hours and dialyzed against 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.3 containing 1 mM of EDTA. SLAC was purified from the crude lysate by DEAE weak anion exchange chromatography (AKTA FPLC with HiPrep 16/10 DEAE FF, GE Healthcare). Protein was eluted with a steep gradient of NaCl from 0 to 100 mM. Fractions containing SLAC, blue in color, were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and purified to greater than 95% purity using size exclusion chromatography (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Yields of 20­25 mg of purified SLAC were obtained.

2.3. Activity assay with [Os(dm-bpy)2 (1-MeIm) Cl]Cl2 The low molecular weight osmium complex was synthesized with an analogous procedure to that previously reported (Buckingham et al., 1964). The activities of SLAC and TvL were determined by measuring the initial rate of oxidation of the osmium complex from a 1+ to a 2+ state in air-saturated solution. The change in oxidation state was observed by the change in absorption at 520 nm ( = 6700 M-1 cm-1 ). All assays were carried out in at least triplicate in clear 96 well plates (Corning Inc., Corning NY) and the UV­vis measurements acquired with a SpectraMax M2 microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale CA). Solutions were buffered with 100 mM of citrate, pH 4 and 5, or phosphate, pH 6, 7, 8 and 9. Buffer pH was adjusted with HCl or NaOH as required. 2.4. DET electrode preparation A carbon nanotube ink was prepared with 0.9 mL of pH 7 phosphate buffer, 0.1 mL of 5% Nafion modified with tetrabutylammonium salt, and 5 mg of CNT powder (Topcagic and Minteer, 2006). The ink was sonicated for 30 min. A 10 L aliquot of the CNT ink was dropped on a screen-printed carbon electrode (Alderon Biosciences, Durham, NC) and left in a humid chamber for at least 24 h, until dry. The enzyme was immobilized on the CNT-modified electrode by adding 10 L of 5% glutaraldehyde and 10 L of 10 mg/mL SLAC solution. A schematic of both the DET and MET electrodes is shown in supplementary material. 2.5. MET electrode preparation The redox polymer poly(n-VI12 [Os(bpy)2 Cl]+/2+ ), with a redox potential of 0.43 V (SHE), was synthesized as described previously (Forster and Vos, 1990). Briefly, polyvinylimidazole was produced by free-radical polymerization in ethanol and precipitated in acetone (Dambatta and Ebdon, 1986). The precursor osmium complex was synthesized by reaction of bipyridine with ammonium hexachloroosmiate in dimethylformamide, followed by precipitation in ether. The complex was reduced by sodium dithionite and attached to the polyvinylimidazole backbone by refluxing in ethanol for three days, followed by purification by ultrafiltration. Glassy carbon rotating disc electrodes (3 mm diameter, produced in-house) were sanded with 1200 grit ultra fine sandpaper (Buehler, IL), and polished with 0.3 m and 0.05 m alumina slurries, followed by sonication for 10 min in deionized water. After the cleaning procedure, no electrochemical features were visible for a bare electrode over the potential range of water stability between hydrogen and oxygen evolution in pH 4 100 mM citrate buffer at 50 mV/s scan rate. A solution of the redox polymer (10 mg/mL) was combined with a solution of either SLAC or TvL (20 mg/mL), and a solution of PEGDGE cross-linker (5 mg/mL) was added, in amounts necessary to produce a film with a total protein composition of 19­42% by weight in a matrix of cross-linked redox polymer. The redox polymer to cross-linker mass ratio was held constant at 9:1. For both enzymes, the optimum composition was found to be 61% poly-

mer, 32% laccase, and 7% cross-linker by weight, in agreement with previous findings (Calabrese Barton et al., 2001). This composition was used for all experiments. An aliquot of 5 L was pipetted onto the electrode surface to give a material loading of 0.69 mg/cm2 . The electrode was allowed to cure for 5 h at room temperature in a low-humidity environment, R.H. < 10%. See supplementary material for a schematic. Composite carbon paper electrodes were constructed by cutting a 4 mm disk of GDL10AA (SGL Carbon AG, Weisbaden, Germany) and affixing to the glassy carbon RDE with conductive carbon paint (SPI, West Chester, PA). After drying for 2 h, the carbon paper was made hydrophilic by treatment in air plasma for 5 min, and the film solution was added as in the planar electrode case and allowed to cure overnight in ambienthumidity conditions. To minimize the effects of deactivation during storage, all electrodes were characterized immediately after the curing step. 2.6. Electrochemical instrumentation and methods All electrochemical experiments were carried out in a waterjacketed cell containing 100 mL of the indicated 100 mM buffer with a jacket temperature of 40  C. Measurements were performed with a Autolab III potentiostat (Eco Chemie). Electrodes were rotated using a Pine Instruments Rotator. Glassy carbon rotating disk electrodes (RDEs) were constructed from 3 mm diameter, type 1 glassy carbon rods (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA). Potentials were measured relative to a silver-silver chloride (3 M NaCl) reference electrode (BAS, West Lafayette, IN). Platinum gauze was used as the counter electrode. Electrochemical measurements for the DET experiments were performed using the screen-printed electrodes, with a carbon counter electrode and Ag|AgCl reference electrode, in pH 7 phosphate buffer or pH 4.8 acetate buffer. Apparent electron diffusion of the MET mediator, Dm , was calculated from the current response following a potential step, using the Cottrell equation (Bard and Faulkner, 2001). In quiescent, nitrogen-saturated solution, the working electrode was held at a reducing potential until negligible current was recorded. The potential was stepped to an oxidizing potential, and after an initial nonlinear regime, current decayed linearly to zero with the inverse square root of time, indicating an apparent Fickian diffusion of charge (Forster et al., 1989; Majda, 1992). The slope of the linear region in 10­30 ms period following the potential step was used to calculate Dm . Stability of the operating electrodes was characterized by fitting the initial 30 min of potentiostatic operation to a first-order decay of the form i(t) = i0 exp(-t/ d ). A selection of electrodes were run for longer intervals, up to 12 h, and it was found that the time constant,  d , calculated from the initial 30 min was indicative of electrode decay at longer times. 3. Results Direct connection of SLAC to a carbon electrode allows electron transfer directly to the copper active sites of the enzyme, shown in Fig. 1a at pH 7. Oxidation and reduction peaks are

highly resolved at approximately 0.59 and 0.27 V (SHE), respectively. Similar scans on high surface area CNT electrodes are shown in Fig. 1b at several potential scan rates. Capacitive current increased due to the added surface area, and oxidation peak height increased from approximately 40 nA to 500 nA at a 20 mV/s scan rate. Peak height was found to be proportional to scan rate, with an intercept at the origin, indicating monolayer behavior (Bard and Faulkner, 2001). Redox potential of the active site copper was estimated at 0.43 V (SHE), lower than the value of 0.5 V reported by Machczynski et al. (2004). Initial rate activity measurements of TvL- and SLACcatalyzed electron transfer from oxygen to an osmium cosubstrate in air-saturated solution are shown in Fig. 2 for a range of pH values. The low molecular weight osmium redox complex [Os(dm-bpy)2 (1-MeIm)Cl]Cl2 , was structurally similar to the polymer mediator used for MET electrodes, with a slightly lower redox potential of 0.20 V (SHE). The optimal pH of TvL

Complex concentration is 100 M in air-saturated 0.1 M buffer at 40  C. Buffer is 0.1 M citrate at pH 4­5 and 0.1 M phosphate at pH 6­9.

was acidic, with an observed initial turnover rate of 140 s-1 in air-saturated buffer of pH 4­5 and a kinetically saturated redox complex concentration; TvL was essentially inactive at neutral pH. The optimal pH range for SLAC was higher; an initial rate of 210 s-1 was observed at pH 6, and substantial activity remained at pH 8. The inset of Fig. 2 shows the effect of mediator concentration on the reaction rates at pH 7. Fitting the Michaelis Menten equation to these results yields an apparent kcat of 110 ± 10 s-1 and apparent KM of 10 ± 2 M for the osmium complex. Machczynski et al. (2004) reported SLAC activity against a negatively-charged small inorganic molecule, ferrocyanide, as similar in magnitude, with a maximum reported apparent kcat of 120 s-1 at pH 4.6, which decreased monotonically as pH increased to 5.4. However, in the current work, a biphasic relation between pH and activity is seen with the positively-charged osmium complex. This behavior is more similar to that observed previously for phenolic substrates such as 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP), where a biphasic pH-dependency of the apparent kcat was observed, peaking around pH 8, albeit with a much lower magnitude of 10 s-1 (Machczynski et al., 2004). Polarization curves for MET enzyme electrodes prepared from SLAC and TvL in oxygen-saturated buffer are shown in Fig. 3. Measurements were obtained at near-optimum pH for each enzyme--pH 7 for SLAC and pH 5 for TvL. As electrode potential was swept to reducing values, current was produced until reaching a plateau value, ipl , at which point performance was limited by a combination of substrate transport and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The effect of oxygen concentration on the plateau current is shown in the inset. When the electrolyte was oxygen-saturated, performance of the TvL electrode was 33% higher than that of the SLAC electrode. Under saturated air the difference decreased to 15%. Considering the design of these electrodes, the redox polymer mediator had a redox potential of 0.43 V (SHE), resulting in an overpotential 1 for mediator-to-enzyme electron transfer, designated as Eet , of 390 mV in the case of TvL (Solomon et al., 1996). For SLAC, the observed enzyme redox potential (obtained from Fig. 1) is identical to that of the redox polymer, a condition that would normally give rise to poor mediation kinetics. It is

Conditions are 40  C at 900 rpm in 0.1 M pH 5 citrate buffer (TvL) and 0.1 M pH 7 phosphate buffer (SLAC). Polarization was initiated at high potential at 2 mV/s scan rate. Inset shows response to varying oxygen fraction in the sparging gas, with error bars indicating the standard deviation of three experiments.

possible, however, that electron transfer from enzyme to mediator occurs at a higher potential than that of DET to the carbon electrode. Literature studies of the kinetics of electron mediation indicate that this redox polymer­TvL combination lies in a maximal 1 kinetic regime due to a large value of Eet (Zakeeruddin et al., 1992; Takagi et al., 1998). For SLAC, reduced electron-transfer 0 kinetics are expected, as redox polymer potential Em is close to that of the enzyme. A difference in activation potential of 25 mV can also be seen in Fig. 3, indicating that the onset is partially enzyme-controlled, likely due to a difference in Michaelis constant with respect to the mediator (Bartlett and Pratt, 1995). Fig. 4 shows the pH dependence of the plateau current for each type of MET electrode. Enzyme electrodes prepared from TvL displayed a maximum current density of 2.0 mA/cm2 at pH 5, decreasing at higher pH, to only 11% of the peak performance at neutral pH. These results match the behavior of electrodes from other high-potential laccases--Coriolus hirsutus, Coriolopsis gallica, and Pleurotus ostreatus--although in some of these cases, current density at pH 7 was effectively zero (Calabrese Barton et al., 2001, 2002).

Fig. 4. Effect of pH on plateau current, ipl , for MET enzyme electrodes produced from SLAC and laccase from Trametes versicolor. All other conditions as in Fig. 3. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three experiments.

SLAC electrodes produced a maximum current density of 1.8 mA/cm2 at pH 6. Although the redox potential of the SLAC enzyme is lower than that of TvL, the SLAC electrodes produced significant current density of 1.4 mA/cm2 at pH 7. This reaction may be driven by the overpotential for enzyme-oxygen 2 charge transfer, Eet , which has a value of 300 mV at pH 7. Mediated enzyme electrode performance depends not only on the catalytic reaction of the enzyme, but also on the charge transport to the electrode surface through the film bulk. Apparent electron diffusion, Dm , remained unchanged throughout the pH range for electrodes from each type of laccase, indicating that the activity profiles in Fig. 4 were not a function of charge transport within the film. Charge transport in SLAC enzyme electrodes, with an average value of (2.8 ± 0.61) × 10-9 cm2 /s, was slightly higher than in TvL electrodes with an average of (1.7 ± 0.27) × 10-9 cm2 /s (see supplementary material). In all cases, matching results were obtained at pH 6 in both citrate and phosphate buffer. Fig. 5 shows time constants of film stability,  d , as the enzyme electrodes were subjected to shear at 900 rpm. Electrode stability was highly variable, depending on the components of the system (TvL or SLAC) and the pH environment. TvL electrodes displayed considerable stability at low pH, with  d = 3100 min at pH 4, corresponding to a half-life of 36 h assuming that deactivation rate remains constant throughout the electrode lifetime. A similar system constructed from laccase of C. hirsutus was reported with  d = 1900 min, at 37  C and 1000 rpm (Calabrese Barton et al., 2001). As pH increased, electrodes of TvL became less stable, deactivating on the order of  d = 110 min at neutral conditions. This instability could be explained as hydroxide inhibition at the T2/T3 cluster, or as partial denaturation of the protein (Xu, 1997). Electrodes of SLAC, however, displayed considerable instability at acidic pH, with  d = 14 min at pH 4, near the lower limit to obtain steady-state data. With increasing pH, SLAC electrode stability increased, although a time constant of  d = 103 min was obtained only at pH 8. These results may be interpreted by considering the substantial difference in isoelectric point, pI, between TvL and SLAC. TvL has a measured pI of 3.5, while that of SLAC is quite high,

reported as the range of 7.3­8.2 for oxidized and reduced states (Piontek et al., 2002; Machczynski et al., 2004). In the present formulation, the enzyme is incorporated in the film structure as an electrostatic adduct with the cationic redox polymer. Below its pI, SLAC is net-cationic, and will not form an adduct with the redox polymer (Heller, 1992). SLAC electrodes prepared and cured at pH 9 and subsequently operated at pH 7 produced ipl and Dm values matching the electrodes prepared normally, but with increased  d . This improvement was temporary, however, and  d decreased to the standard value after approximately 1 h of operation, indicating the effect is temporary. Performance of an MET SLAC composite electrode on GDL10AA carbon paper is shown in Fig. 6. By increasing electrode surface area, ipl was increased to 6.8 mA/cm2 in oxygen-saturated buffer at pH 7, comparable to previous carbon composite electrodes operating in similar conditions (Calabrese Barton et al., 2001; Mano et al., 2002). The dependence on RDE rotation rate is shown in the inset, where maximum current densities approaching 8 mA/cm2 were observed at high rotation rate. 4. Discussion The bacterial laccase SLAC exhibited far superior performance at pH 7 compared to TvL, a finding explained by an approximately 300 mV lower T1 site potential of the enzyme. Redox potential of the oxygen reduction reaction is 0.92 V (SHE) at pH 5 and 40  C, where TvL is maximally active, but is 0.80 V (SHE) at pH 7. The redox potential of the T2/T3 cluster is difficult to determine, but can be estimated as slightly higher in potential than the T1 copper, indicating that the overpotential 2 for T2/T3 to oxygen electron transfer, Eet , may be negative for TvL at neutral pH. Xu has reported data for high- and lowpotential laccases interpreted in this same fashion, with laccase of T. villosa (E0 = 0.78 V) having a maximum activity at pH 5, and laccase of Myceliophthora thermophilia (E0 = 0.43 V) having a maximum at pH 7 (Xu, 1997). Performance of TvL and

SLAC in MET electrodes follow the same trend as observed spectrophotometrically in solution. The pH profile of the MET electrodes is therefore controlled by enzyme kinetics and not by charge transport, because the electron diffusion coefficient, Dm , was observed to be weakly dependent on pH. The observed solution-phase turnover rate of SLAC may be used to estimate a kinetic limit to electrode performance. Using the turnover rate at pH 7 and assuming a SLAC enzyme electrode film of approximately 1 m thickness, with enzyme concentration of 7 mM based on the reactive dimer species (69 kDa MW), one calculates a theoretical maximum current density in absence of all limitations of 7 mA/cm2 for the unsupported film electrode. The performance shown in Fig. 3 was lower by a factor of 5, likely due to substrate and electron transport limitations. Importantly, a carbon composite enzyme electrode using SLAC has yielded the highest current density yet reported for such a system on a rotating disk electrode operating at pH 7. The mediated SLAC electrode is unstable below pH 8, attributable to the high isoelectric point of SLAC. Lowering the pI of SLAC would likely resolve this issue, raising the stability to near 2000 min, a common value observed for comparable electrodes in the literature (Calabrese Barton et al., 2001; Mano et al., 2002). The pI of SLAC may be engineered through rational protein design or directed evolution. As one example, TynanConnolly and Nielsen modeled amino acid mutations to affect overall protein pKa and pKa of an enzyme active site and therefore activity at a given pH (Tynan-Connolly and Nielsen, 2007). In addition to manipulation of enzyme pI, directed evolution and rational design may be used to improve other enzyme characteristics such as activity, stability, redox potential, and electron transfer (Gelo-Pujic et al., 1999; Bulter et al., 2003; Wong and Schwaneberg, 2003; Nazor and Schwaneberg, 2006; Zhu et al., 2006). The fact that SLAC is bacterially-expressed enables methods of directed evolution including DNA, ribosome, and possibly phage display not accessible to glycosylated fungal proteins. Due to its relatively small size per active site, activity at neutral pH, and lack of glycosylation SLAC is an ideal candidate for further protein engineering efforts. 5. Conclusion The bacterially-expressed small laccase (SLAC) of Streptomyces coelicolor was attached to a Nafion-bound single-walled CNT electrode by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde, allowing direct electron transfer from the current collector to the copper active sites of the enzyme. DET facilitated direct observation of enzyme oxidation and reduction, and redox potential was found to be approximately 0.43 V (SHE). SLAC was also incorporated into a cross-linked film electrode within a redox-active mediator consisting of pendant osmium moieties on a polyvinylimidazole backbone. This mediated electron transfer cathode compared favorably to electrodes prepared using laccase from Trametes versicolor, displaying higher electrode performance at pH 7. Maximum stability of the SLAC electrodes was observed at pH above the relatively high isoelectric point of SLAC. Electrode instability at pH 7 was ameliorated temporarily by curing at pH 9, suggesting that electrostatic interactions within the film

were responsible for stability. High surface-area carbon electrodes further increased current density, producing 7 mA/cm2 in oxygen-saturated buffer at pH 7, 900 rpm and 40  C, the highest reported performance for such a system.
