Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) participates in the degradation of cellulose and lignin. The protein is an extracellular ¯avocytochrome with a b-type cytochrome domain (CYTcdh) connected to a ¯avodehydrogenase domain (DHcdh). DHcdh catalyses a two-electron oxidation at the anomeric C1 position of cellobiose to yield cellobiono-1,5-lactone, and the electrons are subsequently transferred from DHcdh to an acceptor, either directly or via CYTcdh. Here, we decribe the crystal structure of Phanerochaete Ê chrysosporium DHcdh determined at 1.5 A resolution. DHcdh belongs to the GMC family of oxidoreductases, which includes glucose oxidase (GOX) and cholesterol oxidase (COX); however, the sequence identity with members of the family is low. The overall fold of DHcdh is p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase-like and is similar to, but also different from, that of GOX and COX. It is partitioned into an FAD-binding subdomain of a/b type and a substrate-binding subdomain consisting of a sevenstranded b sheet and six helices. Docking of CYTcdh and DHcdh suggests that CYTcdh covers the active-site entrance in DHcdh, and that the resulting distance between the cofactors is within acceptable limits for interdomain electron transfer. Based on docking of the substrate, cellobiose, in the active site of DHcdh, we propose that the enzyme discriminates against glucose by favouring interaction with the non-reducing end of cellobiose.

glycosidic linkages. The cellulose is associated with various other polysaccharides (hemicelluloses) and is embedded in a heterogeneous network of phenylpropanoid units known as lignin. Because of the complexity, robustness, and chemical stability of wood, a large number of microbial enzymes are required for the ef®cient solubilisation of lignocellulosic materials. In particular, wood-decaying fungi play an important role in this process. Cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) is an extracellular ¯avocytochrome produced by many lignocellulose-degrading fungi,1 of which CDH from the white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium is one of the best characterised.2 The enzyme is produced and secreted when cellulose is the main carbon source. It is distinct from other cellulose or lignindegrading enzymes secreted by the fungus, in that it depolymerises cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin,1 as well as various other polymeric

422 compounds3 in vitro. CDH contains an N-terminal cytochrome domain of spectral class b (CYTcdh, residues 1-1904,5) connected via a 25 residue peptide linker to a C-terminal dehydrogenase domain (DHcdh, residues 216-7554,5) with ¯avin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as cofactor. The linker is normally susceptible to cleavage by papain, which allows the two structurally independent domains to be separated proteolytically.6 In the reductive half reaction, DHcdh catalyses the oxidation at the anomeric C1 position of cellobiose to yield cellobiono-1,5-lactone,7 while FAD is reduced to FADH2. The lactone is hydrolysed spontaneously to cellobionic acid. During the oxidative half reaction, the ¯avin is re-oxidised to FAD by an electron acceptor, either directly or via CYTcdh. In the ¯avocytochrome, reducing equivalents obtained from the oxidation of cellobiose are transferred one-by-one from the ¯avin to the haem.8 The preferred substrates for CDH are di- or polysaccharides such as cellobiose, lactose and soluble cellodextrins, whereas monosaccharides such as glucose and mannose are poor substrates. The discrimination against glucose by CDH is strong, as indicated by an 87,000-fold larger speci®city constant (kcat/KM) for cellobiose compared to glucose.1 The strong discrimination between mono- and disaccharides by CDH has been used to construct amperometric biosensors for the measurement of cellobiose, lactose and cellooligosaccharides.9 Although the in vivo electron acceptor for CDH is unknown, CDH can use a large number of one and two-electron acceptors in vitro.1,10 The means by which CDH degrades polymeric substrates has been suggested to involve the generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals produced in a Fenton-type reaction.1 The Fenton reagents, i.e. hydrogen peroxide and ferrous ions, are thought to be formed by fungal oxidases and CDH-mediated reduction of ferric ions, respectively. Based on its amino acid sequence, DHcdh is a member of the glucose-methanol-choline (GMC) family of large oxidoreductases comprising relatively diverse amino acid sequences.4,11 Two members of this family have known three-dimensional structure: glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger and Penicillium amagasakiense (GOXAsp12,13) (GOXPen13); and cholesterol oxidase from Brevibacterium sterolicum (COXBre14,15) and Streptomyces sp. (COXStr16). These enzymes carry FAD as a cofactor but, in contrast to CDH, they are not associated with a cytochrome domain. Their overall folds are similar to that of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH)17 and glutathione reductase,18 also known as the PHBH fold.19 Only a few crystal structures of ¯avocytochromes are available, none of which displays sequence or structural homology to members of the GMC oxidoreductase family. Crystallisation of the complete ¯avocytochrome is hampered by the extensive inter-domain peptide linker. Therefore, we have chosen to carry out crystal-structure determination of the cytochrome and

Flavin Domain of Cellobiose Dehydrogenase

¯avoprotein domains separately. We have recently reported the crystal structure of CYTcdh20 showing that this b-type cytochrome has a b-sandwich fold resembling that of the antibody Fab VH domain, and that the haem iron is ligated by the side-chains of Met65 and His163. Here, we present the crystal structure of the ¯avoprotein domain of CDH, determined using multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) and multiple isomorphous replacement, including anomalous scattering inforÊ mation (MIRAS) techniques and re®ned at 1.5 A resolution. We also propose a hypothetical model of how the substrate is bound to the active site in DHcdh.

Results and Discussion
Overall structure The asymmetric unit of the crystal structure of P. chrysosporium DHcdh contains two non-crystallographically (NCS) related molecules. The 540-residue large DHcdh molecule is peanut-shaped with Ê Ê Ê approximate dimensions of 72 A Â 57 A Â 45 A (Figure 1). The secondary-structure elements are depicted in Figures 2 and 3. As predicted from sequence similarity,4,11 the overall structure of DHcdh is similar to the PHBH-like folds of GOX12,13 and COX14 ± 16 (Figure 3). The polypeptide chain folds into two structurally distinct subdomains; one that binds the FAD cofactor and one that binds the substrate, cellobiose. Despite the fact that PHBH-like folds have been encountered in proteins that are not ¯avoproteins or enzymes,19 we have chosen to refer to the two subdomains as the ¯avin-binding (F) and the substrate-binding (S) subdomain. In the ¯avocytochrome, the N-terminal cytochrome domain ends at residue 190 followed by the inter-domain peptide linker (residues 191 to 215). In the DHcdh structure, unambiguous electron density is present at the N terminus of molecule B corresponding to the C-terminal residues 210 to 215 of the peptide linker. Thus, proteolytic treatment of CDH with papain results in cleavage of the polypeptide chain after residue 190 and before residue 210. Due to differences in crystal packing and local disorder, there is no interpretable electron density for the C-terminal region of the linker in molecule A. The structure of the FAD-binding subdomain (F subdomain) of DHcdh comprises 205 residues: 216 to 249, 404 to 511 and 693 to 755 (Figures 2 and 3(a)). The structure is of type a/b and features a six-stranded, mainly parallel, b-pleated sheet (sheet A) sandwiched between a b meander (a threestranded antiparallel b sheet; sheet C) and three a helices (H1, H5 and H12); similar to that of several other FAD-binding proteins.21 As predicted from the amino acid sequence,4 the binding of the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) moiety of the cofactor involves the characteristic bab mononucleotidebinding motif, or Rossmann fold, frequently encountered in NAD and FAD-dependent

enzymes.22 ± 24 The F subdomain also contains three additional a helices (H6, H7 and H8) that pack together to form a substructure on one side of the F subdomain. The F subdomain forms the roof over the ¯avin-binding pocket. The substrate-binding subdomain (S subdomain) consists of 335 residues: 250 to 403 and 512 to 692 (Figures 2 and 3(b)), and the main structural feature is a central twisted, seven-stranded b sheet (sheet B) with three a helices (H3, H4 and H10) on one face of the sheet, and the active site on the other. Two additional a helices (H9 and H11) are present in this subdomain, as well as a relatively long 310 helix (H2; residues 275 to 283). Sheet B forms the ¯oor of the active site. At the end of

strand B6, a cis-peptide bond is formed between Thr666 and Pro667. A four-stranded, slightly irregular, antiparallel b sheet (sheet E/F) forms one side of the ¯avin-binding pocket close to the ribo¯avin moiety of the FAD cofactor. In this sheet, the two b strands closest to the cofactor (E1 and E2) form a connection between the F and S subdomains. On the side of the ribo¯avin moiety opposite this linking sheet, a 310 helical turn (residues 305 to 308) helps to anchor the ribityl chain of the cofactor. At the beginning of the S subdomain, residues 250 to 299 form a loop-and-lid structure that delineates the active-site entrance (loop, residues 250 to 288) and the outer wall of the FADbinding pocket (lid, residues 289 to 299).

Cellulose binding In vitro, CDH adsorbs speci®cally to cellulose6,25,26 through a binding site that is located in DHcdh but does not coincide with the active site.6

To date, only the CDH sequence from Thielavia heterothallica has been reported to contain a cellulose-binding domain (CBD) for binding to the cellulose surface, namely a fungal type-2 CBD.27 The amino acid sequence of P. chrysosporium CDH does

426 not indicate the presence of a separate CBD,11 and the absence of a CBD is con®rmed by the structure. Based on results from cellulose-binding studies and mapping of the amino acid sequence of CDH onto the aligned structures of GOX and COX, we hypothesised that the cellulose-binding properties of CDH may be located in one of two highly variable regions in the GMC oxidoreductase sequence family,11 namely residues 251 to 299 or residues 342 to 398. The former sequence constitutes the loop-and-lid region and is a natural hotspot for deletions and insertions among GMC oxidoreductases. The latter sequence includes helices H3 and H4, and the b strands B1 and B1a. As mentioned above, the loop-and-lid structure serves to shield the ¯avin-binding pocket and delineate the activesite entrance. In GOX, this region is also involved in forming the dimer interface of the homodimer, whereas in CDH, the corresponding molecular face is the likely docking surface for the cytochrome domain (see section Domain association below). Despite this, the possibility cannot be ruled out that amino acids in this region may interact with the cellulose surface. In the present structure however, there is, no obvious substructure or surface patch that can be assigned unambiguously as the cellulosebinding site. Thus, the structural basis for the strong absorption of CDH to cellulose remains to be determined, suitably by site-directed mutagenesis. Flavin binding A funnel-shaped tunnel is formed at the interface between the F and S subdomains in DHcdh. The tunnel leads from the surface to the buried active site where the isoalloxazine moiety of the noncovalently bound FAD cofactor is positioned, some Ê 12 to 15 A from the surface of the molecule. The lid segment of the loop-and-lid structure in the S subdomain is positioned immediately outside the ADP moiety of the FAD molecule, shielding the FAD-binding pocket from the solvent. The only disul®de bond present in the structure is formed between cysteine residues 291 and 300 of the lid, thus ®xing the position and conformation of this segment. The segment is further secured by Asp293 and Arg247, which interact to form a bidental salt-bridge. In the F subdomain of DHcdh, the N-terminal residues 216 to 246 constitute the ADP-binding bab motif (A1-H1-A2) that binds the adenine ring and interacts with the pyrophosphate oxygen atoms of FAD. This region includes the conserved glycine-rich sequence G-X-G-X-X-G (in DHcdh, G223-X-G225-X-G227-G228). The four nitrogen atoms of the adenine ring of FAD (N1, N3, N6 and N7) interact with two main-chain nitrogen atoms, one main-chain carbonyl group and two water molecules. The ribose moiety and the pyrophosphate groups are bound at the topological switch-point

Flavin Domain of Cellobiose Dehydrogenase

between b strands 1 and 4 of the F subdomain (strands A1 and A4). In the adenosine-ribose moiety, the 2H -OH group interacts with Glu246 Oe2 and the 3H -OH group with Glu246 Oe1 and Leu301 O. Following the loop-and-lid structure, residues 305 to 308 forms a 310 helical turn that interacts with the AO2 pyrophosphate oxygen atom of AMP through Gly305 N. On the other side of the pyrophosphate group, a second 310-helical turn (residues 721 to 725) interacts with the O2P oxygen atom in the other pyrophosphate group through Ala722 N. In total, the pyrophosphate oxygen atoms interact with ®ve water molecules and two protein main-chain nitrogen atoms. The O-2* and O-3* hydroxyl groups of the ribityl chain interact with Asn309 Nd2 and one water molecule, respectively. Interactions observed for the ¯avin ring system include O2-Gln734 N, O2-Leu312 O, O2-SOL (solvent molecule), N3-Leu312 O, O4-Ala311 N, O4-Leu312 N, O4-SOL, N5-SOL, and O6-SOL. As expected from the spectral properties of the ¯avin chromophore (see Materials and Methods), the ¯avin cofactor is present as 6-hydroxy FAD (6-OH FAD). Unambiguous electron density exists for a hydroxyl group attached to the C6 atom of the isoalloxazine ring (Figure 4). The B factors of the 6-OH and 4-OH oxygen atoms are similar, consistent with a high degree of hydroxylation at C6 in the crystallised protein. The presence of CDH6-OH-FAD in cultures of P. chrysosporium was noted previously.28 In the literature, the effects of 6-OH FAD in ¯avoenzymes range from complete lack of activity to almost unaffected catalytic performance. For CDH6-OH-FAD, decreased speci®c activity for cellobiose in the reductive half reaction has been reported.29 The isoalloxazine ring is sharply bent along the N5-N10 axis (butter¯y bending). The angle between the normals to the two planes de®ned by the endocyclic atoms of the xylene and pyrimidine moieties of the ¯avin ring is 22  . Similar to what has been reported for several ¯avin-dependent enzymes,21 the N1-C21O locus of the ¯avin ring is close to a positively charged entity, in this case the N terminus of the C-terminal a helix of CDH. The helix dipole provides a partial positive charge at the N terminus of the a helix and may therefore, together with the butter¯y bending of the isoalloxazine ring, modulate the redox potential of the semiquinone and hydroquinone state of the FAD cofactor. On the ¯avin side opposite that facing the substrate (¯avin si side), the backbone nitrogen Ê atom of Gly310 is 3.5 A from the ¯avin N5 atom and forming an angle with N5-N10 of 129  . Although the N5-N distance is somewhat long for a hydrogen bond, the arrangement is similar to that found in several ¯avoenzymes.21 The active site and proposed binding of cellobiose Ê The shape and size of the 12 A long tunnel that leads down to the active site and ¯avin ring

accommodates a cellobiose molecule easily. To outline a possible set of interactions for substrate binding in CDH and try to explain the strong discrimination against glucose, cellobiose was modelled in the active site. Cellobiose was ®tted easily in DHcdh and two glucosyl-binding sites were identi®ed (Figure 5). The innermost glucosylbinding site adjacent to the ¯avin ring is referred to as subsite C (C for catalytic), and the binding site close to the tunnel entrance as site B (B for binding). The substrate as well as the protein residues participating in substrate binding are all located at the re face of the ¯avin ring. The reducing (R) end glucosyl moiety (Glc1) and the nonreducing (NR) end glucosyl moiety (Glc2) are bound in subsites C and B, respectively. The C-site glucosyl unit is positioned with a distance of Ê roughly 3 A between the anomeric C1 atom and the N5 atom of the ¯avin ring. Glc1 is within Ê hydrogen-bonding distance (<3.2 A) of three proe2 tein side-chains: His689 N -Glc1 O1, Asn732 Nd2Glc1 O1, and Ser687 O-Glc1 O2. The C1 and C2 hydroxyl groups in this site may also interact with

the N5 and O4 atoms of the ¯avin ring, respectively. In GOXPen, a similar set of protein interactions has been suggested for binding of b-D-glucose in the catalytic site (His520 Nd1-Glc O1; His563 Nd1-Glc O1; and Asn518 O-Glc O2), but the model of GOXPen also suggests six additional hydrogen bonds for the glucose molecule in this site:13 Arg516 NZ1-Glc O3, Arg516 NZ1-Glc O3, Asn518 Od1-Glc O3, Tyr73 OZ-Glc O4, Ser114 Og-Glc O6, and FAD O4-Glc O6, and a hydrophobic stacking interaction between the exocyclic C6-O6 group at the b face of the glucose ring and the ring of Phe418. None of these additional interactions is present in site C of CDH, but instead, ®ve interactions are offered to the NR-end glucosyl unit in site B, i.e. four hydrogen bonds: Arg586 Ne-Glc2 O2, Glu279 Oe2-Glc2 O2, Arg586 NZ2-Glc2 O3, Glu279 Oe1-Glc2 O3, and a planar hydrophobic stacking interaction between the aromatic ring of Phe282 and the a face of Glc2. Asn688 Nd2 is positioned between the subsites B and C, and with only minor positional changes in the cellobiose

The reducing-end glucosyl unit (Glc1) is the end of the cellobiose molecule positioned closest to the ¯avin ring, while the non-reducing end of cellobiose (Glc2) stacks with the aromatic ring of Phe282.

molecule, the asparagine may interact with either Glc2 O6 in site B, or Glc1 O3 in site C. In GOXPen, site-directed mutagenesis targeting Arg516, which is within hydrogen-bonding distance to the glucosyl O3 atom in the catalytic subsite, has shown that this residue is absolutely essential for ef®cient binding of b-D-glucose.30 The space where Arg516 is positioned in GOXPen, is essentially occupied in CDH by the NR of cellobiose, i.e. Glc2. In summary, the model of cellobiose in the active site of CDH suggests that in site C, the position of the anomeric C1 atom, the linking oxygen atom and the C2 hydroxyl group are important determinants for substrate binding and catalysis, whereas the C3 and C6 hydroxyl groups may be of of less importance. The key protein residues for hydrogen bonding in subsite C are His689, Asn732 and Ser687. These residues are all fully conserved in the amino acid sequences available for CDHs (Figure 2). In site B, the orientation of the C2 and C3 hydroxyl groups, and possibly the C6 hydroxyl group, appear to be important. In this site, putative hydrogen-bonding protein residues are Glu279, Arg586 and Asn688. Of these, Arg586 and Asn688 are fully conserved in CDHs, whereas Glu279 is replaced by an asparagine residue in Humicola insolens and Thielavia heterothallica. In a previous study on the kinetic behaviour of various sugars as substrates for P. chrysosporium CDH,31 it was reported that the disaccharides cellobiose, lactose and mannobiose are good or acceptable substrates for CDH, whereas the disaccharide maltose and the monosaccharides mannose, galactose and allose are poor or no substrates. The KM for the mannobiose and galactomannoside are, however, considerably higher than for cellobiose and lactose. These ®ndings suggested that the position of the C2 hydroxyl groups in sites C and B are important for substrate binding, whereas the position of the C4 hydroxyl group in subsite B is of less importance. These results are in agreement with the structural data presented above. The disaccharide b-xylobiose lacks both exocyclic C6-O6

groups and did not act as a substrate for CDH.31 Although the kinetic data suggest that the C6 hydroxyl groups may be involved in substrate binding, we ®nd no obvious structural explanation for the lack of activity on b-xylobiose. The fact that monosaccharides are poor or no substrates for CDH may also be due to the presence of various modes of non-productive binding in the two binding sites. In addition, the difference in the number of possible interactions between the two subsites in CDH is likely to account for the observed discrimination against glucose, suggesting that subsite B is the speci®city-determining site in CDH. Comparison with structurally related enzymes Overall fold As predicted from sequence comparisons,4 the overall structure of DHcdh is similar to that of GOX (A. niger GOX, PDB 1CF3) and COX (B. sterolicum COX, PDB 3COX); nevertheless, the structures are different (Figure 3). COX is the smallest of the three enzymes (506 residues), whereas GOX is the largest (583 residues). This is true also for the individual subdomains. The relative orientation of the F and S subdomains differs slightly in the different proteins, resulting in relatively large rmsd values when both subdomains are used in a superposition (Table 1). The F subdomains of DHcdh, GOX and COX all have in common six of the b strands in sheet A (Figure 3(a)), including the ADP-binding bab motif (A1-H1-A2). As for DHcdh, sheet A is sandwiched between three a helices (H1, H5 and H12 in DHcdh) and the small b sheet C in GOX and COX. In DHcdh, sheet C contains three antiparallel b strands, whereas in GOX and COX, the N terminus is extended to form additional b strands: two in GOX (strand A3a and C1), and one in COX (strand C1). The a-helical substructure in DHcdh de®ned by H6, H7 and H8 is replaced by two a helices in GOX and one a helix in COX. When superimposing only the S subdomains, larger rmsd

values are obtained than for the F subdomains (Table 1). The common, central structural motif of all S subdomains is the six-stranded antiparallel b sheet (sheet B) that forms the ¯oor of the active site (Figure 3(b)). In DHcdh and GOX, an additional b strand (strand B1a) hydrogen bonds to this sheet, parallel with strand B1. A number of a helices are located at the surface of the S subdomain, predominantly at the face of sheet B opposite the active site, though the exact number and position of the a helices differ between the enzymes: ®ve in DHcdh, nine in GOX and six in COX. The S domain in DHcdh also contains a nine residue 310 helix (H2). The cis-peptide bond at the end of strand B6 in DHcdh is present also in GOX (Ile489-Pro490). The loop-and-lid structure A comparison of the different conformations of the loop-and-lid structure in DHcdh, GOX and COX is shown in Figure 6. In COX, the loop-and-lid structure completely covers the active-site entrance and the FAD-binding pocket, thus shielding the active site and ¯avin from solvent. The lid in COX comprises 14 residues and forms a b-turn-b structure (D1-turn-D2) that covers the xylene side of the

¯avin ring. Of the three enzymes, the most extensive loop segment is found in COX (48 residues). Since COX is a functional monomer, the longer loop may compensate for the absence of another domain that can shield the active site. GOX has a longer lid segment than is needed to bury the FAD molecule (21 residues), and the loop segment is shorter (21 residues) than that in COX and DHcdh. As in COX, the lid forms a b-turn-b structure that covers the ¯avin ring in GOX. In the GOX homodimer, the lid from each monomer pack against each other and hence, a number of residues involved in dimer formation are found in this segment. The unique requirements for forming the dimer is therefore the likely explanation for an extended lid segment in GOX. Despite the presence of a second monomer, the two active sites of the GOX homodimer are found to be solvent exposed in the crystal structure. Although DHcdh has the shortest lid segment (ten residues), it suf®ciently covers the the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. The position of the lid is ®xed by a disul®de bond and a salt link. The loop segment in DHcdh comprises 38 residues but, despite its length, it does not cover the entrance to the substrate-binding site completely. However, as

The loop and lid segments are coloured red and blue, respectively. The ¯avin cofactor is coloured yellow. The picture was made as described for Figure 1(a).

430 discussed below, CYTcdh is likely to transiently cover the active-site entrance. The active site Most protein-FAD interactions are conserved in the three enzymes, and differences in the number of interactions occur mainly for the isoalloxazine ring: ®ve possible hydrogen bonds in DHcdh, four in COX and three in GOX. In DHcdh, the O2 and O4 atoms of the ¯avin ring each interact with two main-chain atoms, whereas in COX and GOX, these oxygen atoms, form one hydrogen bond each to a backbone atom. At the si side of the ¯avin ring, three amino acid residues are fully conserved in the three enzymes: Val308-Asn309-Gly310 in DHcdh (residues 118 to 120 in COXBre; 106 to 108 in GOXAsp and 110 to 112 in GOXPen). At the re face of the isoalloxazine ring, His689 occupies a position in CDH equivalent to that of His447 in COXBre, His516 in GOXAsp and His520 in GOXPen (Figure 7). In GOX and COX, this histidine residue has a proposed role to act as a catalytic base in the reductive half reaction. There are two asparagine residues close to the histidine residue in DHcdh (Asn732 and Asn517). The residues occupying equivalent positions in GOXAsp, GOXPen and COXBre are His559/ Gln329, His563/Gln333 and Asn485/Asn421, respectively. If the oxidation of cellobiose in CDH is indeed base-catalysed, then His689 should have a role similar to that of the corresponding histidine residue in GOX and COX, since it is the only base close to the anomeric carbon atom in our substrate model. Domain association The interacting surfaces of the domains of ¯avocytochromes are highly complementary and their interactions have a mainly non-ionic character. Thus, the strength of the interaction is attributed mainly to the area of their shared surfaces.32 The protohaem in CYTcdh is bound near the surface of the molecule, exposing its propionyl side-chains to

Flavin Domain of Cellobiose Dehydrogenase

the solvent, a situation that we predicted would enable the haem propionate groups to be brought relatively close to the FAD cofactor upon association of the domains.20 Upon inspection, the haemexposed face of CYTcdh appears to be highly complementary to the face of DHcdh where the active-site entrance is positioned. Thus, it seems plausible that in the ¯avocytochrome, CYTcdh covers the active-site entrance in DHcdh such that one of the haem-propionyl groups extends into the active-site tunnel. We estimate that a reasonable edge-to-edge Ê distance between the cofactors of less than 15 A can be expected; however, if a haem propionate group would indeed extend into the active site in DHcdh, the shortest haem-to-¯avin distance would Ê be approximately 8 A. In yeast ¯avocytochrome b2 (FCB2), the cytochrome and ¯avodehydrogenase domains associate intimately to position the haem and FMN cofactors with an edge-to-edge distance Ê of 9.7 A to allow rapid inter-domain electron transfer.33 If the cytochrome domain covers the active site, this phenomenon is likely to be transient so as to allow substrate entry and product departure. Furthermore, if the haem propionate group protrudes into the active site, it would compete with the substrate for access to the active site, possibly resulting in substrate-gated electron transfer. This would, at least partly, explain the observation that high concentrations of cellobiose slow or even inhibit electron transfer.34,35 Hence, the active site would be gated by the substrate, and possibly by the product.

Conclusions
The crystal structure of the ¯avoprotein domain of P. chrysosporium CDH reveals a fold that is similar to those of other members of the GMC oxidoreductase family, i.e. A. niger glucose oxidase and B. sterolicum COX, and those of PHBH and glutathione reductase. The structure includes an a/btype FAD-binding subdomain, and a substratebinding subdomain containing a seven-stranded

volumes of protein solution (2 mg/ml) and reservoir containing 1.6 M ammonium sulfate, 10 % (v/v) dioxane and 100 mM Mes (pH 6.5). The best crystals were obtained by streak-seeding of a drop that had been preequilibrated for six to eight hours at 15  C. Green-yellow crystals with rhombohedral morphology grew in one day from a streak-seeded drop at 15  C. The crystals were of space group R3, with cell constants Ê Ê a  b  185 A and c  81 A in the hexagonal setting. Data collection statistics are summarised in Table 2. All data sets were collected at 100 K and processed with either the HKL package36 or MOSFLM.37 Structure determination and refinement The structure was solved by a combination of MAD Ê and MIRAS methods (Table 2). Initial phases to 3.9 A resolution were obtained from a three-wavelength MAD experiment on a platinum derivative using the program SOLVE38 for local scaling and automatic solution of the heavy-atom substructure. After density modi®cation in DM,39 the map was still of poor quality, but it was possible to deduce the 2-fold NCS operator and perform a rough, initial sequence tracing with the program O.40 These rough phases could also be used for identifying heavy-atom sites in other derivatives. Eventually, good Ê phases to 2 A resolution were obtained in MLPHARE39 by the MIRAS method using the merthiolate, PtCl4 and CdCl2 derivatives. After solvent ¯attening and 2-fold averaging in DM,39 the structure was traced and built automatically using the ARP/wARP package.41 For the automatic building and subsequent re®nement, data to Ê 1.5 A resolution were used, i.e. the DHcdh-merthiolate data. Re®nement statistics and model quality are summarised in Table 3. Rebuilding between re®nement rounds was guided by sA-weighted maps, and the same set of Rfree re¯ections was used throughout all re®nement. Initial re®nement was done with CNS42 and included simulated annealing with torsion-angle dynamics, anisotropic scaling, energy minimisation, individual isotropic B-factor re®nement and bulk-solvent correction against the maximum-likelihood amplitude target. Final re®nement was done with REFMAC543 using the maximumlikelihood residual, bulk-solvent correction, anisotropic B-factor re®nement and hydrogen atoms in their riding positions. In all, 11 side-chains, mostly serine residues, have been modelled with alternative conformations (four in molecule A, and seven in molecule B). The electron density is of excellent quality, and all of the 1087 protein residues in the asymmetric unit are clearly visible. Cellobiose dehydrogenase contains both N- and O-linked carbohydrates.28 In the model, N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) is present at asparagine residues 434, 593 and 599. The NAG residue attached to Asn434 in molecule B is disordered and has not been modelled. In addition, O-linked mannose residues are found at residue Thr215 in molecule A and residues Thr211, Ser213 and Thr215 in molecule B. Mercury atoms belonging to merthiolate molecules were identi®ed from their anomalous signal. To account for some of the apparent disorder in the mercuric compounds for which only the mercury atom is visible, these mercury atoms were given suitable partial occupancies. The bending angle of the isoalloxazine ring was calculated using the least-squares plane method implemented in MOLEMAN2,44 after which the angle between the normals to the LSQ planes was calculated.

b sheet and six helices. In vivo, CDH is a functional ¯avocytochrome carrying an antibody-like b-type cytochrome. To date, CDH is the only known extracellular ¯avocytochrome and, moreover, it is the only known example of a GMC oxidoreductase to which a cytochrome has been grafted to yield a ¯avocytochrome. The face of the ¯avoprotein domain where the active site is located displays a high degree of surface complementarity to the face on the cytochrome that exposes the haempropionyl groups. We estimate that association of these faces would enable the cofactors to communicate over a distance relevant for inter-domain electron transfer. When cellobiose is docked in the active site of the ¯avoprotein domain, two glucosyl-binding sites are con®rmed. Based solely on the number of possible protein-substrate hydrogen bonds, the non-reducing end of cellobiose is likely to be bound more ®rmly than the reducing end where oxidation takes place. This partly provides the basis for the observed glucose discrimination by CDH. Close to the C1 hydroxyl group of the substrate, the conserved His689 is suitably positioned for a role in the catalytic machinery, possibly as a catalytic base, similar to what has been proposed for the equivalent histidine residues in GOX and COX. However, in order to con®rm the mode of substrate binding and to gain further insight into the catalytic mechanism of CDH, inhibitor complexes and site-directed mutagenesis studies are required.

Materials and Methods
Protein purification and deglycosylation DHcdh and CYTcdh were made from P. chrysosporium CDH strain K3 as described.6 To improve crystal quality, the ¯avoprotein was deglycosylated with a-mannosidase (Boehringer-Mannheim) and endoglycosidase H f (Endo Hf ; New England Biolabs) in a solution containing 0.05 M sodium citrate (pH 5.0), 0.01 M ZnCl2, eight units/ml of Endo Hf , 0.1 mg/ml of a-mannosidase and 2.5 mg/ml of ¯avoprotein for 24 hours at 37  C. The protein mixture was dialysed and applied to a Mono Q (HR 5/5) column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). DHcdh was eluted in two peaks with a salt gradient. At pH 8.0, the two ¯avoprotein species displayed different coloration and optical spectra. The ¯avoprotein that eluted ®rst represented 60 % of the total amount, was yellow in colour, and displayed absorption maxima at 387 and 457 nm. The retained ¯avoprotein represented 40 % and was coloured bright green with absorption maxima at 344 and 428 nm. At pH 5.0, however, both ¯avoprotein species were coloured yellow. Based on the optical spectra alone, the ¯avoprotein with absorption maxima at 344 and 428 nm was likely to contain 6-OH FAD as ¯avin chromophore. Crystallisation and data collection Crystals of the 6-OH FAD-containing DHcdh were obtained using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. Hanging drops were prepared by mixing equal

The endocyclic atoms of the xylene moiety (C5A, C6, C7, C8, C9 and C9A) and the pyrimidine moiety (N1, C2, N3, C4, C4A and C10) of the ¯avin ring were used to de®ne the two LSQ planes, respectively. Least-squares comparisons in Table 1 were made in O,40 and the transformations were improved by performing a leastsquares match by Semi Automatic Alignment in O40 (the lsq_improve command). The structures to be compared were searched for the longest possible matching structural fragments of at least three residues for which each Ê atom pair could be aligned within a distance of 3.8 A.

Docking of cellobiose in the active site Cellobiose was modelled manually in the active site of the re®ned model of DHcdh using the program O.40 To relieve geometric strain and impose favourable van der Waals contacts, the model was subjected to 200 cycles of energy minimisation with CNS42 without the X-ray pseudo-energy term. During the energy minimisation, only Ê atoms within a sphere of 5.5 A from the linking oxygen atom in the glycosidic bond were allowed to move. Ê Atoms within a cushion of 3.5 A around the sphere were also re®ned, but with harmonic restraints. After minimisation, only minor positional changes were observed for non-carbohydrate atoms.

Quality and contents of the refined model Based on the electron-density map, the sequence assigned to DHcdh agrees with that of P. chrysosporium CDH determined by Li and co-workers.5 For two sidechains, Met512 and Ile656, there are discrepancies between the sequence and the actual shape of the electron density. Met512 and Ile656 have well-de®ned electron density, but resemble leucine and valine, respectively. Whether they represent true cDNA-sequencing errors, or merely distortions in the electron density is not known. The geometry of the re®ned models are restrained with rmsd values from ideal bond lengths and Ê bond angles45 of 0.021 A and 1.9  , respectively. The model contains: two protein molecules, residues 215 to 755 (A), and residues 210 to 755 (B); two 6-OH FAD molecules; ®ve NAG residues (three in molecule A and two in B); four mannose residues (one in molecule A and three in B); six mercury atoms and one merthiolate molecule in A, and three mercury atoms in B; as well as a total of 1120 water molecules.
