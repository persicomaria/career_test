ABSTRACT Transcription in archaea employs a eukaryotic-type transcription apparatus but uses bacterial-type transcription factors. NusG is one of the few archaeal transcription factors whose orthologs are essential in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Archaeal NusG is composed of only an NusG N-terminal (NGN) domain and a KOW domain, which is similar to bacterial NusG but not to the eukaryotic ortholog, Spt5. However, archaeal NusG was confirmed recently to form a complex with rpoE@ that was similar to the Spt5-Spt4 complex. Thus, archaeal NusG presents hybrid features of Spt5 and bacterial NusG. Here we report the crystal structure of NGN from the archaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MjNGN). MjNGN folds to an a-b-a sandwich without the appendant domain of bacterial NGNs, and forms a unique homodimer in crystal and solution. MjNGN alone was found to be sufficient for rpoE@ binding and an MjNGN-rpoE@ model has been constructed by rigid docking.

INTRODUCTION During all stages of transcription, the activity of RNA polymerase (RNAP) is highly regulated by numerous cis- or trans-acting elements. Prokaryotic N-utilization substance G (NusG) was originally identified to be involved in transcription antitermination induced by the N protein of bacteriophage k.1 Later, NusG was found to facilitate the Rho-dependent transcription termination by bridging Rho to RNAP.2,3 NusG also accelerates the elongation rate of Escherichia coli RNAP by suppression of the specific polymerase pause sites.4 The eukaryotic ortholog of NusG is Spt5, a large protein typically comprising an acidic N-terminus, an NusG N-terminal domain (NGN), multiple KOW domains and a Cterminal sequence with a set of simple repeats.5 Spt5 and Spt4 form a stable heterodimer DSIF,6 which interacts directly with RNAP II7 and plays dual roles in inhibiting or activating transcription elongation depending on whether NELF exists or not.8­10 Moreover, DSIF was also implicated in rRNA transcription, and its mutation caused defects of RNAP I function.11 Archaea represent one of the three domains of life, and are the closest relatives of the original cellular organisms from which all the current cellular organisms have evolved.12 Archaeal NusG has a concise domain structure similar to bacterial NusG. Recently, we confirmed that archaeal NusG could tightly bind to rpoE@,13 a small protein sharing obvious similarity with Spt4 but originally annotated as RNAP subunit E@. The archaeal NusG presents the hybrid features of bacterial NusG and eukaryotic Spt5, and comparative analysis of these three classes of NusG/Spt5 will help to understand the function and evolution of this essential transcription factor. However, in contrast to NusG/Spt5 in bacteria and

Genes for Methanocaldococcus jannaschii NusG (MjNusG, GeneID: 1451229) and rpoE@ (MjrpoE@, GeneID: 1451253) were synthesized with optimized codons. The NGN domain (residues 1-83) was subcloned into pET22b(1) (Novagen), a vector that expresses proteins with an -LEHHHHHH tag at the C-terminus. The transformed Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) cells were grown to OD600 5 0.6, and induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h at 310 K. Cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0). After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-chelating column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole), and then the target protein was eluted with buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM imidazole). The eluted protein appeared as a single band of 10 kDa on an SDS-PAGE gel. The protein was concentrated to 70 mg/mL and stored in 20 mM NaCl at 193 K.

Oligomer analysis in solution

MjNGN crystals were obtained using the vapor-diffusion method. Sitting drops, each consisting of 1 lL reservoir solution [29% (v/v) dioxane, 20 mM Bis-Tris propane pH 7.0] and 1 lL protein (18 mg/mL), were equilibrated with 200 lL reservoir solution at 295 K, and crystals appeared after 5­7 days. Diffraction data were collected using a single frozen crystal on an RA-Micro007 generator (Rigaku) equipped with a MAR345 detector (MAR Research), and processed with HKL2000.14 The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using ScSpt5NGN (PDB code: 2EXU) as a search model in PHASER.15 Search attempts were made in both the P3221 and P3121 space groups, and only P3221 gave good results. REFMAC516 and COOT17 were employed for refinement and iterative adjustment of the model. TLS18 refinement was executed at the latest stage. The ° final model was refined to 2.04 A resolution with Rwork 5 19.7% and Rfree 5 22.5%, and showed good stereochemical quality when assessed with PROCHECK.19 Data collection and structure refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in Protein Data Bank under the code 3EWG.

Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a Superdex 75 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) with a protein concentration of 20 lM in buffer (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0) at 108C. Using protein markers from the LMW calibration kit (GE Healthcare), the standard curve equation was determined as logMW 5 6.184-0.0266Ve (R 5 0.998) (Ve, elution volume). The molecular weight of MjNGN, MjNusG and MjNusGrpoE@ complex were calculated from their Ve values. For chemical cross-linking experiments, proteins were diluted to 5 lM in 1.5 mL of buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM MES pH 6.0). Glutaraldehyde was added to each protein solution with an optimized final concentration of 2 mM (3 lmol glutaraldehyde for each 1.5 mL), and the samples were incubated for 10 min at 277 K. Reactions were stopped by adding 5 mM lysine. Protein samples were concentrated to $ 1 mg/mL and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

The native/mutant GST-MjrpoE@, MjKOW and MjNusG were overexpressed with pGST-tev (a gift from Prof. D.C. Wang), pET22b(1) (Novagen) and pQE30 (Qiagen), respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of

MjNusG was performed with the MutanBEST kit (TaKaRa) following the user manual. The purified GST/GST-rpoE@ proteins were immobilized on 20 lL glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). Purified target proteins (100 lg) were incubated with the beads in 0.5 mL of binding buffer [500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100] for 15 min. The beads were then washed three times with binding buffer.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The structure of MjNGN

The structure of MjrpoE@ was generated using SWISSMODEL.20 Rigid docking software Hex5.121 was employed to dock MjrpoE@ onto MjNGN. The initial orientations of MjNGN and MjrpoE@ were set according to the structure of the ScSpt5NGN-Spt4 complex (PDB code: 2EXU). Both proteins were allowed to rotate Æ158 in each direction and Æ158 around the intermolecular axis. The calculated total interaction energy (Etotal) included the shape energy (Eshape) and electrostatic

MjNGN adopts a b-a-b-b-a-b-a topology. The four b-strands form an antiparallel b-sheet in the order b2b3-b1-b4. The a-helices flank the central b-sheet with a1 and a2 on one side and a3 on the other side, which makes MjNGN fold into an a-b-a sandwich [Fig. 1(A)]. To date, two intact bacterial NusGs from Aquifex aeolicus (AaNusG)22,23 and Thermus thermophilus (TtNusG)24 and the NGN domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spt5 (ScSpt5NGN),13 have had their structures determined. The core fold is conserved among these NGNs. The closest structural homolog of MjNGN in PDB is ScSpt5NGN, and their sequence identity and rmsd of the Ca atoms ° are 24% and 1.9 A for 80 residues, respectively. However, the sequences linking secondary elements are variable in NGNs. MjNGN represents a minimal version

of an NGN, and many insertions exist in other NGNs. The most obvious insertion is the appendant domain between b2 and b3 (numbered according to MjNGN) in bacterial NGNs [Fig. 1(B) and (D)]. This appendant domain is essential for bacterial NGN,25 but is not present in MjNGN and ScSpt5NGN. Bacterial NGNs also have a short insertion after b4, which forms a protruding loop and increases the volume of the hydrophobic groove between a3 and the b-sheet [Fig. 1(B) and (D)]. TtNGN has another acidic insertion loop at the b3-a2 linker. ScSptNGN contains an insertion that is rich in basic residues between a1 and b2, which changes the local surface from a negative to a positive charge [Fig. 1(B) and (D)]. NusG/Spt5 binding to RNAP is central to its functions, but the binding mechanism is still an open question. For human Spt5, the region between the first and second of its six KOW domains (residues 313-420), is sufficient for RNAP II binding.7 However, the corresponding region does not exist in NusGs. Recently, Escherichia coli RfaH, a paralog of NusG, was found to use a hydrophobic groove of its NGN domain to interact with the b' subunit clamp helices of RNAP.26 Escherichia coli NusG was proposed to have a similar RNAP-binding mechanism because it was found to compete with RfaH for the same binding site on RNAP.27 The vast hydrophobic groove/ cavity was also found in the MjNGN surface, and a dioxane molecule was found to be tightly bound to it. This groove is formed by residues Ala4, Leu39, Tyr42, Leu44, Val67, Ile71, and Leu79 [Fig. 1(C)], most of which are conserved as hydrophobic or aromatic residues in bacterial and archaeal NusGs [Fig. 1(D)]. The structure of MjNGN suggests a possible EcRfaH-like RNAP-binding mechanism in MjNusG.
Homodimerization

In the MjNGN crystal, an asymmetric unit contains only one monomer. However, an MjNGN dimer with a large interface was found when creating the symmetry related molecules. In this dimer, b-sheets of two MjNGNs combine into a large b-sheet by aligning their b2, whose backbones form six strong hydrogen bonds [Fig. 2(A)]. Residues in a1, a3, and b2 of each MjNGN contribute another six hydrogen bonds, 10 salt bridges and several hydrophobic contacts to stabilize the dimer. ° The homodimer buries 798 A2 accessible surface area (ASA) of each molecule, which is about 16.8% of the ° total MjNGN ASA (4762 A2). Observations from the crystal structure strongly suggested a dimer form of MjNGN in solution. We employed gel filtration chromatography to determine the molecular weight (MW) of MjNGN in buffer (200 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0). As determined by the standard curve, the calculated MW of MjNGN is 26.3 kDa, close to twice of the MW of recombinant MjNGN (10.1 kD) [Fig. 2(B)]. Determined the same way, the MW of

intact MjNusG is 38.9 kDa, which is twice the MW of monomer MjNusG (17.2 kDa). These data also indicate that MjNusG forms a dimer [Fig. 2(B)]. Additionally, only the elution peaks of dimers were observed, which

While the rpoE@_S39Y did not bind to MjNusG in the GST pull-down assay, other single-site-mutated MjrpoE@ (rpoE@_L30R, rpoE@_I32R and rpoE@_I34R) and MjNusG (NusG_S32Y, NusG_L34D, NusG_A35D and NusG_E46A) could bind to their wild type partners. In most cases, the formation of heterodimer between two mutated MjNusG and MjrpoE@ proteins were obviously decreased.

suggests dimers are the dominant forms of MjNusG and its NGN domain in solution. The assembly states of MjNusG and MjNGN were also detected using a chemical cross-linking assay in buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM MES pH 6.0). After reacting the proteins with glutaraldehyde, the protein samples showed the bands corresponding to dimers on SDS-PAGE gel [Fig. 2(C)], which confirmed the dimer form of MjNusG and MjNGN in solution. It is surprising to find that MjNusG forms a homodimer. No bacterial NusG or eukaryotic Spt5 has been reported to form a homodimer in solution. Although AaNusG forms domain-swapped dimers in crystal, the dimeric interface cannot maintain the dimer in solution.23 The MjNusG homodimer is stable only before the formation of the MjNusG-rpoE@ complex (see below), so the homodimer should not participate in regulating RNAP. The detailed function of the homodimer is as yet unknown.

The MjNGN-rpoE00 complex

In previous work, MjrpoE@ has been identified to tightly bind to intact MjNusG.13 Herein, the GST pulldown assay clearly revealed that MjNGN alone is sufficient for MjrpoE@ binding and no obvious interactions existed between KOW and rpoE@ [Fig. 3(A)]. Coexpressed MjNusG-rpoE@ has an apparent MW of 28.7 kDa [Fig. 2(B)], which suggests one MjNusG and one MjrpoE@ in the complex. This implies that the interaction between MjrpoE@ and MjNusG disrupts the MjNusG homodimer. A possible reason is that MjrpoE@ binds to the same region of MjNGN that is also crucial for homodimerization. The ScSpt5NGN-Spt4 interface is similar to the MjNGN homodimer interface region. Using ScSpt5NGN-Spt4 as the initial template, we constructed a complex model of MjNGN-rpoE@ with rigid docking. Hex generated and clustered 5000 complex models, and the best 100 clusters were displayed for

viewing. Considering the binding energy and the residue­residue interactions at the interface, cluster 11 gave the most rational model [Fig. 3(B)]. The calculated Etotal is 2424.00 kJ/mol, including Eshape 5 2203.08 kJ/mol and Eforce 5 2220.92 kJ/mol. The interface of MjNGNrpoE@ is quite similar to that of ScSpt5NGN-Spt4. The b2 of MjNGN and b3 of MjrpoE@ are aligned in an antiparallel direction, and they form six backbone hydrogen bonds and several hydrophobic contacts [Fig. 3(C)]. Residues around the two b strands also participate in MjNGN-rpoE@ binding. Particularly, side chain of Glu46 of MjNGN b3 locates near the N-terminus of MjrpoE@ a1 [Fig. 3(B)] and forms a strong acid-dipole interaction. This acid-dipole interaction is conserved in archaea and eukaryotes, and mutations of it caused several growth defects in yeast.13,28 To check the docking model of the MjNusG-rpoE@ complex, eight MjNusG and MjrpoE@ mutant proteins were designed. As the complex model, the rpoE@_L30R, rpoE@_I32R, rpoE@_I34R, NusG_L34D and NusG_L35D could reduce the hydrophobic contacts between the MjNusG and MjrpoE@. The rpoE@_S39Y and NusG_S32Y were supposed to cause the steric conflicts and disrupt the MjNusG-rpoE@ complex. NusG_E46A would remove the acid-dipole interaction. In the GST pull-down assays, the interactions between the mutant MjrpoE@s and the wild type MjNusG were not found to be obviously decreased except the rpoE@_S39Y [Fig. 3(A)]. The interactions between the wild type MjrpoE@ and the mutant MjNusGs were not obviously decreased [Fig. 3(A)]. We also detected the interactions between each mutant MjrpoE@ (except rpoE@_S39Y) and each mutant MjNusG, and we found that the interactions were obviously weaker than wild type proteins in most cases [Fig. 3(A)]. These results could be explained by the fact that the MjNusG-rpoE@ heterodimer has a large interface, and omitting a few interactions by a single-site mutation usually did not affect its stability. Dissociation of the heterodimer might need the combination of two or more mutations. We also expressed an MjNusG with three mutant residues (NusG_I33D_L34D_A35D), which would remove several hydrophobic contacts between MjNusG and MjrpoE@. The rpoE@-binding ability of NusG_I33D_L34D_A35D was found to be much weaker than wild type MjNusG [Fig. 3(A)]. The mutational analysis supported the docking model of MjNusG-rpoE@ well. When the structure of MjNGN-rpoE@ was superimposed onto ScSpt5NGN-Spt4, their NGNs, and the bsheets and zinc fingers of ScSpt4/MjrpoE@, were quite well aligned, but the a helices at the top of ScSpt4 totally disappeared in MjrpoE@ [Fig. 3(D)]. The lack of these top helices exposes the zinc finger of rpoE@. Whether the zinc finger in MjNusG-rpoE@ has a nucleic acid-binding ability in the transcription elongation complex needs to be studied further. Furthermore, the bacterial NusG does not have a corresponding binding partner, but do have

an appendant domain, which folds into a b barrel or hairpin at the position similar to where rpoE@/Spt4 locates [Fig. 3(E)]. This appendant domain was suggested to work as a structural element, such as a post or a stack, rather than as a site for residue-specific contacts in Escherichia coli NusG.25 Whether Spt4, rpoE@ and the appendant domain have a similar function remains unclear. In summary, we have determined the crystal structure of MjNGN, the first such structure of an archaeal NusGs. Archaeal NusG has a concise domain structure similar to bacterial NusG, but the crystal structure and heterodimerization mode suggest that archaeal NGN is similar to Spt5. The hybrid structure features might reflect the functions of archaeal NusG, which interacts with eukaryote-type RNAP but does not play the eukaryote-specific roles of Spt5 in chromatin structure and RNA processing. Furthermore, MjNusG was found to form a stable homodimer before encountering MjrpoE@, but the detailed function of the homodimer needs to be studied further. REFERENCES
