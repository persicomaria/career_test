BINDING OF SALICYLIC ACID AND ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID TO HUMAN SERUM ALBUMIN 1. The binding of salicylic acid (SA) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to human serum albumin (HSA) has been further elucidated through use of the gel filtration technique of Hummel. The method is analogous in principle to equilibrium dialysis and is suited to study the binding of small molecules to macromolecules. The bound complex is placed on a column previously saturated with a solution of the small molecule and is eluted with the same concentration of small molecule. 2. Results using this method show the HSA-ASA bond to be strong in comparison to the relatively weak binding of SA to HSA. Evidence points to the conclusion that the HSA molecule has a relatively large number of weak binding sites for SA in comparison to a smaller number of stronger binding sites for ASA. Time studies indicated that ASA equilibrium binding was reached only after 120-150 hours of contact with HSA.

studies showed t h a t binding of SA and its congeners increased as the concentration of the salicylate was decreased or t h a t of serum albumin was increased. Salicylate analysis was carried out spectrophotometrically b u t no differentiation was made between SA and ASA. Gel filtration techniques introduced in 1960 with the availabitiSy of Sephadex made possible the rapid and simple detection of SA and ASA bound to h u m a n serum albumin ( H S A ) . Whitehouse and Routh (4) used Sephadex G-25 to separate bound from free salicylate in plasma proteins. Albumin showed the g r e a t e s t binding capacity of any of the plasma proteins. P o t t e r and Guy (5) were able to separate and analyze for bound salicylate, free ASA and free SA, and total plasma salicylate with Sephadex G-25 and fluorometry. The bound portion was assumed to be in the form of SA. Separation of ASA and SA was achieved simply and rapidly by Lee, Thompkins and Spencer (6) through the use of Sephadex G-10 and A-25. Ali and R o u t h (7) used Bio-Gel P-2 and C-14 tagged salicylates to determine the extent of binding of SA to HSA, b u t a t t e m p t s to separate free SA from a mixture of the bound and free forms resulted in a large loss of SA f r o m the bound form. Several investigators have established the equilibrium binding time of SA to H S A as 4-8 hours. However, to date no definitive time for equilibrium binding of ASA to H S A has been published. Most recently H a w k i n s et al (8) have published results of ASA binding a f t e r an incubation period of 24 hours with no mention of equilibrium, while Ali and R o u t h (7) found t h a t even a f t e r 53 hours of contact equilibrium had not been reached. The present s t u d y was carried out to f u r t h e r investigate differences in the binding of SA and ASA to HSA, particularly with respect to binding strength. The gel filtration technique of Hummel (9), analogous in principle to equilibrium dialysis but having the a d v a n t a g e s of shorter time and g r e a t e r suitability for small samples, was employed. In essence, a protein is dissolved in a solution of the desired binding ion. The concentration of the free ion in this solution is decreased b y the amount bound to the protein. An aliquot of this solution - - complex plus free ion - - is placed on a column which has been equilibrated with the ion solution used for binding and is eluted with the same strength of ion solution. The protein is completely excluded by the gel type. As the protein complex continues to move down the column the ion continues to bind. As the bound complex is removed in the excluded volume a peak is produced and the concentration of the ion in the peak is g r e a t e r than its initial concentration. The depletion of free ion in the eluate following the protein peak results in a trough. The size of the trough below the base line is related to the amount of ion bound in the protein peak. :

Prepared according to Bray (11); containing 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO) and 1,4-bis-2 (4-methyl-5-phenyloxazoyl) benzene (dimethyl POPOP), Beckman Instrument Co.; naphthalene, methanol, and 1,4-dioxane, Fisher reagent grade; ethylene glycol, J. T. Baker reagent grade. Preparation of gel columns: Glass tubing, 5 mm inside diameter by 150180 mm long, was drawn to a tip at one end. The cleaned and dried columns were coated with dichlorodimethylsilane on the inside. Sephadex G-10 was soaked in phosphate buffer for at least six hours to assure hydration of the gel. A glass wool plug was inserted into the tip of the column and the gel suspension introduced by means of a syringe equipped with a long needle to exclude trapping of air bubbles in the column.
GEL FILTRATION METHODS Phosphate buffer elution: Small aliquots (0.2-0.3 ml) of the solutioa to be analyzed were placed on the gel with a pipet. After the solution was absorbed by the gel the sides of the column were washed with a small amount of buffer. Buffer was added to fill the column and the column was connected to the buffer reservoir. Fractions were collected in a Buchler Fractomat fraction collector equipped with a drop counter.

H u m m e l Gel Filtration Technique: The Sephadex column was equilibrated with a solution of S A or A S A by connecting the column to a reservoir of the appropriate solution and passing it through the column until the effluent samples gave a constant fluorometric reading for salicylate.

Fractions collected by either the phosphate b u f f e r elution or the Hummel method were generally 0.25 or 0.50 ml in size. The fractions were diluted to 3.0 ml with b u f f e r and 1.0 ml was used for each of the subsequent tests: biuret f o r protein, fluorescence for salicylates, and liquid scintillation counting f o r radioactivity. Protein Analysis: A 1.0 ml portion of solution was mixed with 2.0 ml of biuret reagent and allowed to stand for 10 minutes. Absorbance at 550 nm was measured in a Gilford Model 300 Spectrophotometer. The a m o u n t of protein in the sample was read f r o m a calibration curve prepared by using solutions of HSA r a n g i n g in concentration f r o m 0 to 2.0 mg/ml. Salicylate Analysis: A 1.0 ml portion of solution was mixed with 2.0 ml of 5.5N NaOH and allowed to stand for at least 10 minutes to allow for the conversion of any ASA to SA. The fluorescence was measured in a T u r n e r Model 111 fluorometer, using an 8x75 m m flow-through cell coated on the inside with dichlorodimethylsilane. Slit width was 4 mm and a p r i m a r y filter 7-60 (365 nm) and a secondary filter 405 (405 nm) were used. Salicylate s t a n d a r d curves were prepared f r o m solutions of SA or ASA (expressed as salicylate) r a n g i n g in concentration f r o m 0 to 2.4 ~g/ml. Radioactivity: A 1.0 ml portion of solution was added to 10 ml of scintillation m i x t u r e in a counting vial and counted in a P a c k a r d Tri-Carb liquid scintillation spectrometer Model 3003. Appropriate corrections were made for background. BINDING METHODS Single Cell: The protein and SA or ASA solutions were combined in a test tube and incubated at either 5 C' C, 25 ° C, or 38 ° C. ASA studies were carried out at the lowest t e m p e r a t u r e to prevent decomposition of both HSA and ASA d u r i n g the long period needed for equilibrium binding. At various time intervals aliquots of the binding m i x t u r e were placed on the column and eluted with phosphate buffer, SA or ASA solution. The fractions eluted were subsequently analyzed for protein, salicylates, and radioactivity.

Equilibrium Dialysis Cell: Plastic equilibrium dialysis (E.D.) cells, 1.G ml size, obtained f r o m Bel A r t s Corporation, were used. The dialysis membrane is placed between the two halves of the cell. Each half is equipped with a teflon-covered micro s t i r r i n g flea. The protein solution in b u f f e r was placed in one h a l f of the cell and the C-14 labeled salicylate solution in the other half. The cells were placed on a magnetic s t i r r e r and maintained at a t e m p e r a t u r e of 5 ° f o r the duration of the binding period. Aliquots were removed and analyzed as above.

RESULTS AND. DISCUSSION

The choice of Sephadex G-10 for gel filtration resulted from the r e p o r t of Lee, Thompkins, and Spencer (6). E x p e r i m e n t s with Sephadex A-25, C-25, and G-10 showed the latter to be best suited f o r separation of HSA, ASA, and SA under the conditions used in the present experiments. An example of the separation achieved with G-10 is presented in Fig. 1. Three sharp areas of elution corresponding to HSA, ASA, and SA were obtained in this order when the components were eluted with phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. E x p e r i m e n t s with SA verified the relatively short time required for equilibrium binding. In view of the a p p a r e n t unbinding of SA from the H S A - S A complex on a conventional column system, the method chosen was the equilibrium dialysis-gel filtration system of H u m m e l previously described. When H u m m e r s method was used to elute a bound H S A - S A complex from a column saturated with SA a trough appeared extending over the volume corresponding to the elution volume of SA, as shown in Fig. 2. A similar p a t t e r n was obtained when an A S A - H S A complex was eluted on an ASA s a t u r a t e d column, seen in Fig. 3. The depth of the trough varied with the H S A - S A or H S A - A S A ratio, and also served to indicate the extent and rate of binding. The differences in rate of binding appear in Fig. 4, where the trough area as measured by use of a planimeter is seen as a function of increasing albumin concentration. Salicylate concentration was held at 0.18 mM (with ASA expressed as salicylate) while H S A was increased. The trough area increases v e r y rapidly with increasing H S A concentration when SA is the binding molecule, but much more slowly when ASA is being bound. When C-14 labeled compounds were used to quantitate binding, very low binding values for SA were obtained a f t e r the complex w a s passed through the Sephadex column. Equilibrium dialysis experiments, on the other hand, indicated that binding as high as 9 6 ~ had occurred. Elution of an aliquot of such a "C-salicylic acid-HSA complex bound in an E.D. cell and collected on a S A - s a t u r a t e d column with cold SA produced a trough comparable in area to that of the SA in the protein-bound peak. At the same time, counts of the radioactivity on the eluates indicated that a large a m o u n t of the C-14 labeled SA had been detached f r o m the albumin. Fig. 5 illustrates both results. A similar situation prevailed when a S A - H S A complex was eluted with phosphate b u f f e r on a b u f f e r - s a t u r a t e d column. Both procedures indicate that an extensive unbinding of the labeled SA had takenlJlace on the column.

The results obtained in the SA binding studies imply t h a t the SA-HSA bond is characterized by weak forces easily disrupted even under the gentle t r e a t m e n t of gel filtration. A f u r t h e r conclusion may be d r a w n f r o m the results of the elution of the '"C-labeled complex with cold SA. The bound radioactive SA molecules appeared to have unbound f r o m the protein when the complex f i r s t contacted the gel molecules and were exchanged with cold SA molecules on the column. F u r t h e r series of experiments involving the binding of acetyl-l-'4C-sali cylic acid were carried out in the E.D. cells at 5 °. The extent of binding was determined a f t e r 72-120 hours on the basis of radioactivity. Aliquots of 0.2 ml of the bound fraction were then applied to a column and eluted in various ways. One aliquot was eluted in the o r d i n a r y way f r o m the buffersaturated column with buffer, and by the Hummel method a second aliquot was eluted f r o m a cold A S A - s a t u r a t e d column with cold ASA and a t h i r d from a cold SA-saturated column with cold SA. On the basis of the total radioactivity found in the bound fractions, about 6 5 ~ of the activity was recovered in the protein peak a f t e r phosphate b u f f e r elution, about 725,: a f t e r cold ASA elution, and about 957~ a f t e r cold SA elution. Repeated experiments produced similar results. E x p e r i m e n t s using acetylsalicylic carboxyl-'~C-acid resulted in similar proportions. In all cases of gel f i l t r a t i o n recovery of bound aspirin was f a r in excess of t h a t for bound SA, indicatiw.. of a much stronger binding force present in the A S A - H S A complex. The possible role of acetylation in binding was considered, following the suggestion of Davison and Smith (3), HSA was acetylated according to the method of Riordan and Vallee (i2) and subsequently treated with either '4C-salicylic acid or acetyl-'~C-salicylic acid in E.D. cells. A f t e r a suitable time interval aliquots from each half of the E.D. cells were counted and no binding was apparent. The following conclusions m a y be d r a w n f r o m the present studies: The forces binding aspirin to albumin are much stronger t h a n those binding salicylic acid to albumin. Modification of the amino groups of HSA by acetylation produced no binding of either SA or ASA. The effect of acetylation on serum albumin is to block e-amino groups. The lack of binding a f t e r acetylation implicates the e-amino group of a lysine residue as a binding site. The presence of albumin appears to have a stabilizing effect on the aspirin molecule. Fluorometric analysis of bound fractions indicated t h a t ASA had not broken down to SA even d u r i n g long binding periods. H u m m e l ' s method of gel filtration is suitable to measure the extent of binding of salicylic acid and aspirin to albumin. Binding of ASA to albumin reached equilibrium over a time period of 120-150 hours as compared to 4-12 hours with the same concentrations of SA and HSA.

The postulation of a slower but stronger binding for A S A agrees with the conclusions of Sykes (13),, who carried out binding studies with NMR techniques, that there is an initial rapid exchange of A S A with at least one site on HSA, but when bound, the complex is stable.
