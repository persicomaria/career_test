Ab initio solution and re®nement of two highpotential iron protein structures at atomic resolution
The crystal structure of the reduced high-potential iron protein (HiPIP) from Chromatium vinosum has been redetermined in a new orthorhombic crystal modi®cation, and the structure of its H42Q mutant has been determined in orthorhombic (H42Q-1) and cubic (H42Q-2) modi®cations. The ®rst two were solved by ab initio direct methods using Ê data collected to atomic resolution (1.20 and 0.93 A, respectively). The recombinant wild type (rc-WT) with two HiPIP molecules in the asymmetric unit has 1264 protein atoms and 335 solvent sites, and is the second largest structure reported so far that has been solved by pure direct methods. The solutions were obtained in a fully automated way and included more than 80% of the protein atoms. Restrained anisotropic re®nement rc-WT and H42Q-1 converged to  for  jFo j of 12.0 and 13.6%, respectively R1  jFo j À jFc j [data with I b 2'I], and 12.8 and 15.5% (all data). H42Q-2 contains two molecules in the asymmetric unit and diffracted Ê only to 2.6 A. In both molecules of rc-WT and in the single unique molecule of H42Q-1 the [Fe4S4]2+ cluster dimensions are very similar and show a characteristic tetragonal distortion with four short FeÐS bonds along four approximately parallel cube edges, and eight long FeÐS bonds. The unique protein molecules in H42Q-2 and rc-WT are also very similar in other respects, except for the hydrogen bonding around the mutated residue that is at the surface of the protein, supporting the hypothesis that the difference in redox potentials at lower pH values is caused primarily by differences in the charge distribution near the surface of the protein rather than by structural differences in the cluster region.

1. Introduction
[Fe4S4] clusters in proteins (Beinert, 1990; Howard & Rees, 1991; Cammack, 1992) and model compounds (Holm, 1992) have been the subject of extensive crystallographic and spectroscopic investigations. [Fe4S4] and other iron±sulfur clusters are found in a wide variety of proteins, usually but not always involved in electron-transfer reactions. Crystallographic studies of [Fe4S4]-cluster proteins began in the early 1970's with structures of a ferredoxin (Sieker et al., 1972) and a HiPIP (Carter et al., 1972; Carter, Kraut, Freer, Xuong et al., 1974; Carter, 1977). Recently a very high resolution [Fe4S4]ferredoxin structure was reported by Dauter et al. (1997); the Ê highest resolution previously reported for a HiPIP is 1.5 A (Rayment et al., 1992). Both ferredoxins and HiPIPs have a stable [Fe4S4]2+ state, but whereas ferredoxins can be reduced to a [Fe4S4]+ state in a biological environment, HiPIPs may be oxidized to [Fe4S4]3+; in both cases only a one electron transfer is observed.

The H42Q mutant crystallizes in two different forms, The project described in this paper, which was started orthorhombic (H42Q-1) in space group P212121 and cubic before the report of the very high resolution ferredoxin (H42Q-2) in space group I213.

Relatively large crystals (0.6 Â 0.3 Â 0.2 mm) of the recombinant wild type (rc-WT) were grown in a 1.3 M solution of ammonium sulfate using the vapour-diffusion method. A cryogenic solution containing the same concentration of ammonium sulfate and 25%(v/v) glycerol proved to be effective for ¯ash freezing the crystal in a loop prior to cryogenic data collection. Although the natural wild type crystallizes in the same space group (P212121) there is only one protein molecule in the asymmetric unit compared with two in rc-WT, and the cell dimensions are not related.
2.2. Data collection

Diffraction data of all the structures reported here were collected using synchrotron radiation on beamline X11 at the EMBL outstation at DESY in Hamburg; details are given in Table 1, which also includes the crystal data (Carter et al., 1972) of the natural wild type for comparison. The cubic Ê H42Q-2 diffracted to a resolution of 2.6 A, whereas the diffraction pattern of the best crystal of the orthorhombic Ê H42Q-1 extended to better than 1.0 A. Ê For H42Q-1 data were collected to 0.93 A at 100 K using a 180 mm MAR Research imaging-plate scanner. Three different crystal-to-detector distances (82, 180 and 380 mm for high-, medium- and low-resolution data, respectively) were employed with Á9 step scans of 1.3, 2.0 and 3.0 , respectively. The overall completeness of 93.0% was achieved by combining data from two different crystals because the ®rst data set was partially incomplete as a result of ice formation during data collection. Although the second crystal did not diffract to quite such a high resolution as the ®rst, data from the two crystals were merged, re®ning a relative B value. 100% complete X-ray data of the cubic H42Q-2 were collected to Ê 2.6 A at 277 K using a 180 mm MAR Research image plate at a distance of 240 mm from the crystal. X-ray data from a single crystal of rc-WT were collected to Ê 1.2 A at 100 K using a 300 mm MAR Research imaging-plate scanner. The overall completeness of 97.3% was achieved by collecting re¯ections at three different crystal-to-detector distances (90, 150 and 390 mm for high-, medium- and lowresolution data, respectively) with Á9 step scans of 0.4, 0.8 and 2.2 , respectively. All data were processed using the HKL suite of programs (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997).
2.3. Structure solution

The two atomic resolution structures were solved ab initio, i.e. from the single wavelength native data alone without the use of known fragments or heavy-atom derivatives, using direct methods based on real/reciprocal space iteration (Sheldrick, 1997, 1998). This procedure involves a search for possible solutions using only the highest normalized structure factors E (the inner loop), followed by an expansion of the solutions with good ®gures of merit using all re¯ections (the outer loop). The outer loop, which is entered very rarely and so does not contribute much to the total computer time required, consists of iterative E-Fourier calculation, peak

search, and elimination of potential atoms to optimize the correlation coef®cient (CC) between E2 and E2 (Sheldrick, o c 1982, 1990; Sheldrick & Gould, 1995). The inner loop, which was inspired by the Shake & Bake philosophy (Miller et al., 1993, 1994) but differs appreciably in implementation, starts with random atoms, uses only the largest E values and iterates tangent formula expansion, E-Fourier, peak search and elimination of potential atoms to maximize the function  S  E2 E2 À 1. o o For these two structures, it was possible to take advantage of the presence of heavier atoms by using the inner loop to search only for the Fe atoms. For rc-WT, 20 random atoms (in the ®rst iteration) or 20 E-Fourier peaks (in subsequent iterations) were reduced to eight potential Fe atoms by maximizing S. These eight atoms provided the initial phases for two cycles of tangent expansion. The phases from the tangent expansion were used to calculate a Fourier map with amplitudes Eo, and the 20 highest peaks that were at least Ê 2.4 A from one another were used as potential Fe atoms in the next iteration. After ®ve iterations using the 3140 largest E À 'Ea2 and 366 865 unique triple phase relations (TPR), CC was calculated for all 51 872 data. For H42Q-1, ten potential Fe atoms were reduced to four by maximizing S; 2415 large E values and 292 560 unique TPR were employed in the inner loop, and CC calculated for all 41 951 data. The structure solutions were repeated after full anisotropic re®nement so that the E-weighted mean phase errors (MPE) could be calculated, taking allowed origin and enantiomorph changes into account. For rc-WT, about 0.7% of the trials led to correct solutions, corresponding to one correct solution every 9 h of 200 MHz Pentium processor time. For H42Q-2 the success rate was 1.5% or one solution every 3 h. The program has subsequently been optimized, which would reduce these times somewhat. The CC values based on the Fe atoms alone were in both cases about 6% better for the correct solutions than for the best incorrect solutions. For rc-WT, the CC for correct solutions increased from about 18% (MPE ca 58 ) to about 75% (MPE ca 27 ) on outer-loop expansion from the eight Fe atoms to ca 1365 atoms. The corresponding ®gures for H42Q-2 were 21% (MPE 54 ) and 73% (MPE 22 ) on expansion from four Fe to ca 615 atoms. The better ®nal MPE for H42Q-2 can be attributed to the higher resolution of the data. Fig. 1 compares the ab initio maps with the electron density from the ®nal re®nement for a well de®ned region (low B values) in the vicinity of the cluster and one of the worst de®ned regions, a loop with high B values. As would be anticipated from the MPE values, the interpretation of these maps was straightforward and only a few side chains with high B values needed to be added with the help of difference maps. It should be emphasized that the ab initio solution of these structures was facilitated by the presence of the Fe atoms, and that atomic resolution was also a necessary requirement. The structure of the low-resolution cubic H42Q-2 was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The natural wild type (Carter et al., 1972) was used as search fragment, as the only difference in the sequence of the two structures consists of the mutation of His42 to

glutamine. The two space groups I213 and I23 are both consistent with the systematic absences; the former was tried ®rst and proved to be correct. The unit-cell volume of Ê 1 860 867 A3 suggested the presence of two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of about 70% (high but not unusual for a cubic space group). A Ê P1 cell with equal axes of 80 A was used to calculate the Fourier transform of the starting model. Data in the resolution Ê range 15±3.0 A were used for calculating the rotation function and to ®nd an initial orientation of the model.

All the atoms in the rigid region around the cluster were found in their correct positions. Only some of the atoms in the side chains of residues on the surface of the protein could not be located in the initial ab initio map. The corresponding rc-WT maps were also of high quality. The electron-density maps (a) and (c) are contoured at the 3' and 12' levels; (b) and (d) are contoured at the 2' and 6' levels.

11.4%. The translation function was therefore calculated for the best 12 rotation solutions, using data in the same resolution range. The best translation of the ®rst rotation solution gave the highest correlation coef®cient and the lowest R factor, 38.1 and 46.3%, respectively. This solution was then used to de®ne the orientation and position of the ®rst molecule and the translation function was calculated for each of the remaining best rotation solutions to ®nd the position of the expected second monomer in the asymmetric unit. The rotation solution number 8 gave the largest rise in correlation coef®cient (to 61.8%) and largest drop in the R factor (to 38.2%).
2.4. Re®nement

The re®nement of all three structures reported here was performed using the program SHELXL97 (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). No restraints were applied to the 1,2 and 1,3 distances involving the atoms of the [Fe4S4] cluster in the two atomic resolution structures, whereas the chemically equivalent 1,2 distances within the clusters of the low-resolution H42Q-2 were restrained to be equal with a standard deviation Ê of 0.02 A. In all cases the Engh & Huber (1991) restraints were applied to all 1,2 and 1,3 distances not involving the Ê clusters with standard deviations of 0.02 and 0.04 A, respectively. Chiral volume restraints were applied to the C atoms (except glycine) and to the C atoms of threonine and isoleucine. Planarity restraints were applied to the atoms de®ning the peptide bond, to the aromatic side chains and to the appropriate parts of the amide, carboxylate and arginine side chains. The H atoms were included in calculated positions in all cases with idealized geometry and re®ned using a riding model. All non-H atoms in both high-resolution structures were re®ned anisotropically, whereas H42Q-2 was re®ned isotropically with the U values of spatially close atoms Ê restrained to be equal (e.s.d.s = 0.03±0.10 A2). Rigid-bond and similar-ADP restraints were applied to the anisotropic atoms. The solvent water atoms were restrained to be approximately Ê isotropic, with an e.s.d. of 0.1 A. Two diffuse solvent parameters (Moews & Kretsinger, 1975) were re®ned throughout, and anti-bumping restraints were employed (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). Local non-crystallographic symmetry Â restraints (Uson et al., 1999) were used in the re®nement of the two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit of rc-WT and H42Q-2. These restrained corresponding 1,4 distances (derived with the help of a connectivity table) to be equal in the NCS-related molecules. No NCS restraints were applied to the anisotropic displacement parameters, but the isotropic displacement parameters of NCS-related atoms in H42Q-2 Ê were restrained to be approximately equal (e.s.d. = 0.03 A2). The re®nement was performed using 95% of the data (50 551, 39 854 and 8911 re¯ections for rc-WT, H42Q-1 and H42Q-2, respectively). The remaining 5% (1321, 2097 and 469 re¯ections) were used only to monitor the re®nement with the È Rfree test (Brunger, 1992) and not for re®nement or calculation of maps. Only in the ®nal re®nement run were the working set and the reference set merged and used for calculating maps.
Acta Cryst. (1999). D55, 1773±1784

The ®nal free R factors (17±20%, see Table 1) probably re¯ect the in¯uence of the large number of weak high-resolution data included in the calculations. The program XtalView (McRee, 1992) was used for manual adjustment of side chains etc., and as an independent check on the structure quality the programs PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and WHAT-IF (Vriend, 1990) were employed. The Ramachandran plots show that for both rc-WT and H42Q-1, 100% of the residues (excluding Gly and Pro) are in the core region (expected 98%) and 78% are in the inner core region (expected 80%; Kleywegt & Jones, 1996); for the low-resolution H42Q-2 the ®gures were 94 and 65%, respectively. About half of the water molecules in the two high-resolution structures were placed using the automatic water divining procedure implemented in the program SHELXWAT (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). The rest of the solvent peaks were assigned by close inspection of the electron-density maps using XtalView. Of the 335 water sites found in the asymmetric unit of rc-WT, 264 were assigned to fully occupied water molecules and 71 to water molecules with half occupancy. For H42Q-1 the 206 water sites consisted of 132 full and 74 half occupancy. Only 50 (full) water molecules could be assigned in the case of the low-resolution structure, mostly by inspection of the electron-density maps, since the limited resolution made the automated water divining procedure less reliable.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. General comments

After completion of the structure determinations, it became apparent that H42Q-1 is essentially isostructural with the natural wild type reported by Carter et al. (1972). The deposited coordinates for single unique protein molecule in this structure may be converted to those found in this work by the transformation 1 À z, 1 À x, y, which involves a cyclic 2 permutation of the unit-cell vectors. However, the rc-WT and H42Q-2 structures, both with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, represent new crystalline modi®cations with unrelated packing of the protein molecules in the unit cell. Since the resolution of the H42Q-2 data was so much worse than that of the other two structures, it will not be discussed further. The two high-resolution structures, including anisotropic displacement parameters and re¯ection data, have been deposited with the PDB for immediate release.
3.2. Assessment of standard uncertainties

For the smallest structure, H42Q-1, it proved possible to invert the full least-squares matrix for the unrestrained coordinates only (Uij held ®xed) to obtain reliable estimates of the standard uncertainties (s.u.) of the atom positions. For rc-WT the corresponding matrix inversion was unstable. The (radial) positional standard uncertainties '(r) are shown in Fig. 2(a) as a function of the equivalent B value B  8%2 U for H42Q-1. The lines show a simultaneous ®t to a quadratic function in B for C, N and O atoms, which takes the form,

It can be deduced that the mean positional s.u. for a C atom with the average B value (14.1) of the Ê non-solvent atoms is 0.057 A. Cruickshank (1999) has suggested two formulae for estimating this value, intended for use in structures not amenable to full-matrix inversion,

where nobs is the number of observed re¯ections, npar is the total number of parameters, dmin is the highest resolution of the data, C is the fractional completeness to this resolution, R is the conventional R index (on all F) and Rfree is the corresponding free R value. Equations (2) and (3) lead to estimates of the mean positional s.u. of a C atom (with an average B) of Ê 0.056 and 0.067 A, respectively, in good agreement with the experimental value. It should be noted that the standard uncertainties 'x in the atomic coordinates will be a factor of 31/2 smaller. Tickle et al. (1998) suggested an alternative relation between Rfree and R to that assumed by Cruickshank, namely, Rfree  R2nobs  npar a2nobs À npar X 4 Ê Combining equations (2) and (4) gives an estimate of 0.62 A for the s.u., in slightly better agreement with the experimental Ê value of 0.57 A than the estimate from (3). The bond-length standard uncertainties from the unrestrained H42Q-1 re®nement (Fig. 2b) show an almost linear monotonic increase with the mean equivalent B value of the two atoms concerned; CÐC bonds tend to have higher standard uncertainties than CÐO bonds with the same mean B values, with intermediate standard uncertainties for the CÐN bonds. Quite a different picture (Fig. 2c) emerges from the corresponding restrained re®nement; all the standard uncerÊ tainties in bond lengths asymptote to the value of 0.02 A that

Ê (1.20 A), the standard uncertainties for the rc-WT structure (also shown in Table 2) are a little larger, however if the equivalent distances in the two molecules in the asymmetric unit are averaged, the resulting standard uncertainties are also Ê about 0.004 A. These standard uncertainties are an order of magnitude less than the precision associated with earlier studies, and justify a re-examination of the cluster geometry to identify possible distortions and differences between these structures.
3.3. Comparison of the three independent molecules

The conformational differences introduced by the mutation are thus small and, on the whole, even smaller than the differences between the two independent rc-WT molecules in the same crystal. It is likely that most of these small differences arise from intermolecular interactions.

be in a position for rapid exchange with the bulk solvent. The site shown in Fig. 8(c) is of interest because the residue Tyr19 (the only completely conserved residue in all HiPIPs apart from those that bind the cluster) may be implicated in electron transfer (Carter, Kraut, Freer & Alden, 1974) though recent work indicates that its primary role is to improve the hydrolytic stability of the cluster (Agarwal et al., 1995; Iwagami et al., 1995). The conserved water molecule is hydrogen bonded to its aromatic OH group.
3.6. Secondary structure

The secondary structure of the monomeric form of the wild type has been described by Carter, Kraut, Freer, Xuong et al. (1974) as mainly consisting of two short -helices (spanning residues 12±16 and residues 28±31, respectively) and 17 hairpin turns, with all the remaining residues in an extended conformation. At atomic resolution this same pattern is observed for all three independent protein molecules. Of the 17 -turns observed, 12 are of type I, two of type II and three of type III, with three pairs of linked hairpins in positions 23±25, 38±40 and 43±45. The two -helical segments, although relatively short, are characterized by combinations of 9a2 angles that are in close agreement with those expected for regular secondarystructure elements of this type. Three short antiparallel -strands extend from residues 48 to 50, 59 to 64 and 70 to 73. Although the rather long portions of polypeptide chain connecting the three strands allow the third strand to be nearly perpendicular to the plane of the ®rst one, the pronounced right-handed twist observed in the second strand accounts for the observed hydrogen-bonding interactions with the other two segments of the chain and, therefore, the stability of their stranded conformation. It is interesting to note that the loop between the ®rst two antiparallel -strands (shown in Figs. 1b and 1d) that shows larger displacement parameters (B values) also shows more pronounced disorder in the solution structures (Banci et al., 1995; Bertini, Dikiy et al., 1995), faster exchange of the peptide protons (Bertini et al., 1997) and higher mobility in the unfolding intermediate obtained in the presence of guanidinium chloride (Bertini et al., 1997; Bentrop et al., 1999).

formation in solution, although in solution each molecule is almost certainly involved in dynamic exchange processes. There is electron spin resonance evidence for dimer formation by the C. vinosum HiPIP in solution (Dunham et al., 1991), and dimers have also been identi®ed in the crystal structures of the R. tenuis and E. halophila HiPIPs (Rayment et al., 1992) that are similar to the dimer modelled from the spectroscopic data. The dimer structure is relevant to the rate of electron transfer between oxidized and reduced forms of the same protein molecule in solution. The shortest approaches of the clusters in the rc-WT and H42Q-2 structures are shown in Fig. 9; the distance between Ê the centroids of the two clusters is 16.7 A in rc-WT (Fig. 9a) Ê in H42Q-2 (Fig. 9b). The mutual orientation of the and 22.2 A two independent molecules of rc-WT is quite different to that found for the two molecules forming the asymmetric unit of the cubic form of H42Q-2. Although the contact surface and the inter-cluster distance in the rc-WT dimer are similar to those found in the previously proposed dimer, the two monomers appear to have been rotated by nearly 180 about the line joining the two clusters. It appears that the dimer found in the rc-WT structure could also be consistent with the spectroscopic evidence, so the presence of both types of dimer in solution would explain the observation that the spectra indicated a mixture of two closely related but different dimers (Dunham et al., 1991). The residues at the interface between the two monomers forming the asymmetric unit of rc-WT are Gln47, Phe48, Met49, Gln64, Leu65 and Ser79 in the ®rst monomer and Ala16, Leu17 and Leu65 in the second one. The interaction between the two monomers provides a rather ef®cient way of stabilizing this large non-polar portion of the protein surface. It is interesting that three of the residues involved in this interaction also make NÐHÁ Á ÁS hydrogen bonds to the cluster, suggesting a possible role (e.g. for the relatively conserved Phe48) in electron transfer. The residues forming most of the interface between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the cubic form of the H42Q mutant are Leu36, Glu40, Gln42, Ala44 and Asp45, and the corresponding residues in the second monomer. The mutation of a positively charged residue (His42) at the working pH to a polar but uncharged amino acid (Gln) has had the effect of removing a positive charge on that portion of the protein surface, thus leaving a large hydrophobic patch that forms the contact surface in the dimer. This may explain why the cubic form crystallized preferentially for the mutant but has not been observed for the wild type.

4. Concluding remarks: implications for electron transfer
The two atomic resolution structures presented here show that the mutation, despite its effect on the redox potential, produced no signi®cant change in the overall conformation of the protein or the detailed geometry of the iron±sulfur cluster. The availability of standard uncertainties from full-matrix re®nement and of two crystallographically independent molecules in the rc-WT structure enabled a reliable assessment of the signi®cance of the small differences observed. The changes introduced by the mutation appear to be localized to its immediate vicinity on the surface of the protein. The difference in redox potential between the mutant and wild type at low pH can thus be attributed to the presence of the positively charge protonated histidine in the wild type. At higher pH this residue is no longer protonated and so the redox potentials are similar, though some pH dependence is still observed for the mutant (Babini et al., 1998). This con®rms the view (Stephens et al., 1996) that these redox potentials are determined by the overall arrangement of point charges and dipoles in the protein rather than by changes in the iron±sulfur cluster geometry or the immediate environment of the cluster. When other electrostatic factors do not change, a change in the

charges on the surface of the HiPIP will have a predictable effect on the redox potential (Banci et al., 1996; Capozzi et al., 1998). A comparison of the three independent molecules in the high-resolution structures reported here also indicated three conserved waters that could provide solvent accessibility to the cluster, which may also be important in the modelling of redox potentials. The relevance of these water molecules as ®xed electric dipoles, as opposed to the rapidly reorientating dipoles of bulk water that are responsible for its high dielectric constant, will have to be assessed by NMR measurements of their lifetimes in the binding sites. The dimer formed between the two crystallographically independent molecules in the rc-WT structure involves a rotation about the inter-cluster vector relative to the previously reported dimer. This observation may require a further analysis of earlier EPR data that were interpreted as suggesting the presence of two different but closely related dimers in solution (Dunham et al., 1991).
