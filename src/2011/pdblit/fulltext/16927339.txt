Introduction. The 2-phosphosulfolactate phosphatase (ComB) gene of Clostridium acetobutylicum encodes an enzyme with a molecular weight of 26,012 Da (residues 1­235) and a calculated isoelectric point of 6.6. ComB is a Mg2 dependent acid phosphatase that catalyzes the second step in Coenzyme M (CoM; 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid) biosynthesis (EC 3.1.3.71), namely, the hydrolysis of (2R)-2-phospho3-sulpholactate to yield (2R)-3-sulpholactate and phosphate [Fig. 1(A)].1 CoM is the terminal methyl carrier in methanogenesis. Methanogenic archaea begin the production of this essential cofactor by sulfonating phosphoenolpyruvate to form 2-phospho-3-sulfolactate. After dephosphorylation, this precursor is oxidized, decarboxylated, and then reductively thiolated to form CoM. Homologs of ComB have been identified in all available cyanobacterial genome sequences and in genomes from phylogenetically diverse bacteria and archaea.1,2 However, many of these organisms lack homologs of other CoM biosynthetic genes. The ComB enzyme from Methanococcus jannaschii is known to act on both stereoisomers of the substrate, and hydrolyzes a number of phosphate monoesters of (S)-2-hydroxycarboxylic acids.1 The crystal structure of ComA, which catalyzes the first step of CoM biosynthesis, has been reported previously.3 Herein, we report the crystal structure of ComB, which was determined using the semiautomated, high-throughput pipeline of the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (JCSG).4 Results and Discussion. The crystal structure of ComB [Fig. 1(B)] was determined to a nominal resolution of 2.6 Å using the multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method. Data collection, model, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model includes three

ComB monomers (residues 1­235 for chains A, B, and C), three (2R)-3-sulfolactate molecules, two Mg2 ions, and 93 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Only the ComB monomer corresponding to chain A will be discussed in the following analysis because the other chains (B, C) are very similar. The Matthews' coefficient (Vm)5 for ComB is 2.33 Å3/Da, and the estimated solvent content is 46.9%. The Ramachandran plot, produced by MolProbity,6 shows that 100% of the residues are in the allowed regions, with 96% in the favored regions. ComB is composed of 10 -strands ( 1­ 10), nine -helices (H3, H4, H7­H13), and five 310-helices (H1, H2, H4 , H5, H6) [Fig. 1(B,C)]. The total -sheet, -helical, and 310-helical content is 18.6, 38.1, and 3.8%, respectively. The ComB monomer is composed of two similar domains, which are probably related by an ancestral gene duplication and fusion event, and a Cterminal helical and -hairpin region. These two domains share a similar overall architecture, show sequence conservation of important residues upon structural alignment, and possess ligand-binding sites at similar positions. The active site residues are contributed by structurally equivalent regions from each of these domains. The second domain (28­103) is related to the first domain (1­27, 104­177) by a circular permutation and

Duplication of protein domains, which produce a circularly permuted version of the original domain, is not uncommon in protein evolution.7 The C-terminal helical region (178­235) is adjacent to the active site and possibly acts as a "lid" over the

active site. This region then extends beyond the active site and forms a C-terminal -hairpin that wedges between the first and second domains [Fig. 1(B)]. PSI-BLAST8 sequence similarity searches reveal that the wedge region of the "lid" domain is not well-conserved among homologs of ComB.

The domains of ComB share architectural similarity with proteins that adopt the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) fold [Fig. 2(A­C)]. It must be emphasized that this structural similarity to members of the PTPase fold is very remote and no evolutionary relatedness between these proteins is implied. The first domain of ComB has an fold that consists of a parallel, four-stranded -sheet (strand order 1423) and four -helices arranged as in three layers [Fig. 1(B)]. The second domain of ComB adopts a similar fold, but lacks the structural elements that correspond to H9 and 1 of the first domain [Fig. 1(B)]. All the - - units in this protein are right-handed. The two domains can be superimposed over 32 C atoms from their -sheets with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 1.28 Å. Such an alignment reveals 15 identical residues and a conservation of hydrophobic and polar residues between the domains [Fig. 2(D)]. The ligandbinding sites of both the domains of ComB are placed in structurally equivalent positions [Fig. 1(B)]. These domains are packed almost perpendicular to each other, bringing their respective ligand-binding regions in close spatial proximity to form the active site [Fig. 1(B)]. In the ComB structure, a Mg2 ion is bound in the cleft of the first domain, whereas the equivalent region in the second domain binds a (2R)-3-sulfolactic acid molecule. The Mg2 ion is coordinated by six ligands in a conventional octahedral geometry [Fig. 2(E)]. The ligands include the sidechain oxygen atoms of Asp26 (2.15 Å) and Asp155 (2.37 Å), the carbonyl oxygen of Gly146 (2.52 Å), and three water molecules (2.54, 2.48, and 3.0 Å). These residues are strictly conserved in ComB homologs.

The structure reveals a 6-Å-wide and 12-Å-deep cavity [Fig. 1(B)] next to the Mg2 site that comprises the surface adjacent to the loops between 4-H5, 5-H7, and 7-H9. Location of this pocket near the Mg2 ion, and its sequence conservation, points to its role as the active site of this protein. Additional electron density in the active site cavity reveals the presence of a noncovalently bound small molecule. Electron density maps (2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc) and mass spectrometric analysis are consistent with a (2R)-3sulfolactate (3SL) molecule, which is the product (in additon to phosphate) of the reaction catalyzed by ComB. The 3SL molecule contacts the side-chains of Arg29, Glu70, Asn83, Thr103, Asn104, and Tyr148, and the main-chain atoms of Leu28 and Gly73 [Fig. 2(E)]. All of these residues are strictly conserved, except for Tyr148 and Gly73. The (2R)-3-sulfolactic acid molecule also interacts with His201 and Arg204 from the C-terminal helical "lid" region [Fig. 2(E)]. Residues that could be involved in catalysis and/or binding include Arg29, Asp26, Asp154, Asp155, Thr103, Thr147, and Asn104. Most of these residues are conserved among ComB homologs from M. jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Thermoplasma acidophilum, Synechocystis sp., and Bacillus subtilis,1 as well as in Thermotoga maritima (TM0797). The crystallographic packing of the ComB structure indicates that a dimer, formed by interactions of -strands 1 and 5, and helices H9, H10, is the biologically relevant oligomeric form [Fig. 2(F)]. The dimer buries a hydrophobic interface with a solvent-accessible surface area of 926 Å2 per monomer. The dimer is consistent with our results

from analytical size exclusion chromatography coupled with static light scattering. A DALI9 structural similarity search using the complete protein molecule as a query did not find any significant hits. A search using the program ProSMoS (Grishin NV, unpublished data) revealed similarities between the two domains of ComB and members of the PTPase II fold. A subsequent DALI9 search using only the first domain (chain A: 1­27, 104 ­177) of ComB as a query then found links to members of the PTPase II fold of SCOP. A DALI search with the second domain did not produce any significant hits. Based on similarity in their activity, ComB has previously been compared with phosphoglycolate phosphatase, a member of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) fold. However, the fold adopted by ComB is different from the HAD-like fold, which is a modified Rossmann fold. Instead, ComB adopts a new fold, with architectural similarities to the PTPase fold. The ComB fold has some resemblance to the core of the HAD-like fold, as both of these folds are three-layered and contain a central parallel -sheet, with -helices arranged on either side of the -sheet. Also, the ligand-binding site is in similar locations in these folds. However, these folds have significant differences and it is unlikely that these two groups of enzymes are evolutionarily related. Thus far, eight PTP subfamilies have been defined based on similarities in the active site and overall structural similarities of the PTP catalytic domain fold.10 Proteins belonging to the PTPase II fold share a common active site structure with the PTPase I family, albeit with a circularly permuted topology [Fig 2(B,C)]. However, these proteins are classified by the SCOP structural classification scheme under separate folds.7 Although both domains of ComB share architectural similarities with members of the PTPase fold, they do not have the consensus CX5R catalytic motif. Also, members of the PTPase fold do not use Mg2 to perform their reaction. Furthermore, the active site of ComB is composed of residues from both domains, and the functional unit is composed of two PTPase-like domains. Also, the second domain, which contributes to binding the substrate, is related by a circular permutation different

from those seen in the PTPase folds. Thus, we classify the domains of ComB as a "new fold" with architectural similarity to the PTPase fold. It is interesting to note how ComB and PTPases have adopted similar structural scaffolds to develop their otherwise unrelated active sites. Current sequence and structural information makes it difficult to speculate about a possible evolutionary connection between the domains of ComB and the PTPases. Availability of more sequences and structures might shed light on the evolutionary history of this important enzyme. The ComB protein family (PF04029) contains more than 50 sequence homologs, mostly of bacterial and archaeal origin. T. maritima contains an ortholog, TM0797, with 40% sequence identity. Models for ComB homologs can be accessed at http://www1.jcsg.org/cgi-bin/models/get_mor. pl?key 15026306. The ComB crystal structure reported herein represents the first example of the 2-phosphosulfolactate phosphatase protein family. The structure includes a bound product molecule that reveals the active site location. The information presented herein, in combination with further biochemical and biophysical studies, should yield valuable insights into the functional role of this enzyme. Materials and Methods. Protein production and crystallization. 2-Phosphosulpholactate phosphatase from C. acetobutylicum (GI: 15026306, Swiss-Prot: Q97E82) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA using PfuTurbo (Stratagene) and primer pairs encoding the predicted 5 - and 3 -ends. The PCR product was cloned into plasmid pMH4, which encodes an expression and purification tag (MGSDKIHHHHHH) at the amino terminus of the full-length protein. The cloning junctions were confirmed by sequencing. Protein expression was performed in a selenomethionine-containing medium using the Escherichia coli methionine auxotrophic strain DL41. Lysozyme was added to the culture at the end of fermentation to a final concentration of 250 g/mL. Bacteria were lysed by sonication after a freeze/thaw procedure in Lysis Buffer [50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)], and the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 32,500g for 30 min. The soluble fraction was applied to a nickel-chelating resin (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with Lysis Buffer. The resin was washed with Wash Buffer [50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP], and the target protein was eluted with Elution Buffer [20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP]. The eluate was diluted 10-fold with Buffer Q [20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mM TCEP] and applied to a RESOURCE Q column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with the same buffer. The target protein, which eluted in the flow-through fraction, was further purified using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) with elution in Crystallization Buffer [20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM TCEP]. The appropriate Superdex 200 fractions were pooled and concentrated for crystallization assays to 14 mg/mL by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Millipore). Molecular weight and oligomeric state of the

target protein were determined using a 1.0 30 cm Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in combination with static light scattering (Wyatt Technology). The mobile phase consisted of 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. The protein was crystallized using the nanodroplet vapor diffusion method11 with standard JCSG crystallization protocols.4 The crystallization reagent contained 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5. Ten percent (v/v) ethylene glycol (final concentration) was included as a cryoprotectant. The crystals were indexed in orthorhombic space group C2221 (Table I). Data collection. MAD data were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS, Berkeley, CA) on beamline 8.3.1 at wavelengths corresponding to the inflection ( 2) and low energy remote ( 1) of a selenium MAD experiment. The data sets were collected at 100 K using an ADSC Q210 CCD detector. The MAD data were integrated and reduced using Denzo and then scaled with the program Scalepack from the HKL2000 suite.12 Data statistics are summarized in Table I. Structure solution and refinement. The structure was determined with 2.6 Å selenium MAD data using the CCP4 suite,13 SHELXD,14 and AUTOSHARP.15 The nominal resolution of the data is 2.6 Å, with 1,104 observed reflections between 2.6 ­2.49 Å (34% complete for this shell) included in the refinement. Automatic model building was performed with iterative ARP/wARP runs.16 Model completion and refinement were performed with data set 1 using O17 and TLS refinement in REFMAC5.18 Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model includes three ComB molecules (residues 1­235 of chains A, B, and C), three (2R)-3-sulfolactate molecules, two Mg2 , and 93 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. No electron density was observed for the expression and purification tag. Validation and deposition. Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the model was accomplished using AutoDepInputTool,19 MolProbity,6 SFcheck 4.0,20 and WHATIF 5.0.21 Protein quaternary structure analysis used the PQS server.22 Figures were prepared with PYMOL (DeLano Scientific).
