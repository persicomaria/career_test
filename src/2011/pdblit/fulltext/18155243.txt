Abstract Trp-262 of the Aspergillus niger family 3 b-glucosidase is shown in this report to be a key residue for determining the ratio of this enzyme’s hydrolytic and transglucosidic activities. TLC showed that when cellobiose was both the substrate and the acceptor, b-glucosidases with substitutions (Phe, Ala, Leu, and Cys) for Trp-262 formed very high amounts of transglucosidic adducts. When pNPGlc was the substrate and the acceptor of the substituted b-glucosidases, only transglucosidic adducts and pNP were produced. Little or no Glc could be detected, indicating that the reactions occurring were mainly transglucosidic. GLC studies with cellobiose quantitatively showed that one Glc was transferred for each free Glc produced. Since this is the maximum level of transglucosidation possible, this again showed that the reaction is predominantly transglucosidic. Analyses of the Km and Ki values of cello-oligosaccharides of increasing length, of the Ki values of Glc and of the transglucosidic activity at low acceptor concentration, showed that substitution for Trp-262 causes poor binding at the binding site for the non-reducing Glc of the substrate while the affinity for other Glc units is only minimally affected. The acceptor sites become saturated with substrate (acceptor) at the concentrations needed for glucosidic bond cleavage and thus only transglucosidic reactions occur. In addition, the data indicate that substitution for Trp-262 causes the rate of the hydrolysis step (k3) to be small. ” 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

cosidic adducts take place. Transglucosidic activity has been noted with b-glucosidases from mammals [1], plants [2], fungi [3], and bacteria [4]. Chemical synthesis of specific oligosaccharides and other glycosides is highly inefficient since it requires several steps, including protection and deprotection, and can generate isomers, side products and intermediates. The transglycosidic activity of glycosidases has been used to produce glycosides in one step [5≠8]. However, their hydrolytic reactions make the synthesis inefficient. Glycosidases that have a propensity for transglycosidic activity could make the process more effective. Van der Waals interactions with Trp are important for binding carbohydrates to enzymes.

Cloning, expression, and purification The plasmid, pPICZAa-BGII [12], was mutated using the primers described above. The altered plasmids were transformed into E. coli Ultracompetent XL2 Blue cells (Stratagene) and purified using a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit. The purified plasmids were linearized by PmeI and transformed into Pichia pastoris X-33 competent cells. Confirmation of incorporation into the P. pastoris genome was obtained by PCR. The media used for expression of all the substituted proteins in P. pastoris was BMGY (buffered glycerol complex medium with yeast nitrogen base) followed by BMMY (buffered methanol complex medium with yeast nitrogen base) with 0.5% methanol added every 24 h for 4≠5 days. The enzymes were purified from the BMMY media after removal of the P. pastoris cells since the pPICZAa-BGII plasmid contains a secretion signal sequence. Recombinant proteins were purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (2.7 M) and gel filtration with a Sephacryl S-300 column as previously reported [12]. SDS and native PAGE of fractions containing b-glucosidase were completed to determine purity and to ensure that the enzymes retained their dimeric structure [12] (dimer molecular weight is $220,000). Emission and excitation fluorescence spectra were obtained for each substituted enzyme and compared to wild type to monitor for gross changes in the structures of the enzymes produced by substitutions for Trp-262. Excitation wavelengths used were 275, 285, and 295 nm and the emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 450 nm with slit widths of 5 nm for excitation and 1 nm for emission. Excitation spectra were also obtained with an emission wavelength of 339 nm with slit widths of 1 nm for excitation and 5 nm for emission. These excitation spectra were recorded from 200 to 300 nm. Enzyme assays Assays at various concentrations of oNPGlc and pNPGlc were carried out in a buffer (pH 4.5, 25 ∞C) composed of both sodium acetate (150 mM) and sodium phosphate (150 mM). The assays were started by adding 0.5 lg of enzyme (13.6 nM) to give a final volume of 0.33 mL. The reactions (in duplicate) were allowed to incubate for periods of 3≠60 min (depending on the rate). Control studies

associations of Trp with sugars [9] occur because most sugars have one face that is less polar than the other. The interactions occur partly because the aliphatic protons of the sugar ring carry small net positive charges and interact with the p-electron cloud of the aromatic ring [10]. In addition, there can also be hydrogen bonds between Trp and the sugars. A b-glucosidase that carries out hydrolytic and transglucosidic reactions was identified in Aspergillus niger and cloned [11]. The sequence showed that the enzyme is a family 3 glycosyl hydrolase. All family 3 b-glucosidase reactions proceed with retention of configuration and the A. niger b-glucosidase is not an exception. Detailed studies of this family 3 b-glucosidase [12] showed that it is an exo-glucosidase. Substrates of this enzyme also act as acceptors (Fig. 1) and methods for following the transglucosidic reactions with substrates as acceptor by TLC and GLC as well as by kinetics have been developed [13]. Comparison of the sequence of the family 3 b-glucosidase from A. niger with other family 3 glycosyl hydrolase sequences suggested that Trp-262 is important in this enzyme because this Trp is strictly conserved and because it is adjacent to Asp-261, the catalytic nucleophile [11]. Trp-262 was substituted with Phe, Ala, Cys, Leu, and Pro by site specific mutagenesis. This report shows that Trp-262 is a key residue and dramatically affects the reactions that occur with this b-glucosidase by affecting the affinity for the non-reducing Glc of the substrate. In this report the reactions of enzymes with substitutions for Trp-262 are shown to be mainly transglucosidic. Materials and methods Mutagenesis Mutagenesis of the b-glucosidase gene was accomplished using the Quik-Change Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase.

were done to ensure that the production of oNP or pNP was linear. The reactions were stopped by adding 0.67 mL of 1 M sodium carbonate. This raised the pH to 10.0 and stopped the reaction. Zero time blanks were subtracted. The extinction coefficients (420 nm, pH 10) for oNP and pNP were 4.65 and 13.01 cm¿1 mM¿1, respectively. Assays of Glc production with cellobiose,2 cellotriose, cellotetraose, cellopentaose, and gentiobiose were carried out with a final enzyme concentration of 8 lg/mL in 50 lL (73 nM). Incubations were done at 25 ∞C and pH 4.5 (in the same buffer as for the pNPGlc assays) for 5≠30 min (depending on the rate of the reaction). Then 40 lL aliquots of the assays were added to a 1.45 mL mixture of hexokinase (4.25 U), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (2.1 U), MgCl2 (13.3 mM), ATP (1.26 mM) and NADP+ (1.87 mM) in 33.3 mM triethanolamine (pH 8.3). At this pH the b-glucosidase is totally inactive while the coupling enzymes are active and therefore the assay measured only the glucose that was produced before the coupling enzymes were added. The reactions with the coupling enzymes were complete after 5 min. The absorbance was measured at 340 nm. Zero time blanks, obtained by the same method but without the addition of b-glucosidase, were subtracted. The total amount of glucose produced by the enzyme was calculated using the extinction coefficient of NADPH at 340 nm (6220 M¿1 cm¿1). Estimates of the kinetic constants were obtained using a non-linear regression program (Prism 4). Wild type b-glucosidase has mainly hydrolytic activity at low substrate concentration but has a significant amount of transglucosidic activity when the substrate concentration is high enough so that it can act as an acceptor [13]. Eq. (1) was previously derived [13] to describe this combination of activity.3 n o 2 K m tﬁk cat hﬁΩS ˛ k cat tﬁΩS ΩEt v0 º . 1ﬁ 2 K m tﬁK m hﬁ ˛ K 0m ΩS ˛ K m tﬁΩS ˛ ΩS Here, v0 is the initial rate when the substrates also act as acceptors; kcat (h) is the catalytic constant of the hydrolytic reaction; Km (h) is the Michaelis constant for the substrate; kcat (t) is the catalytic constant of the transglucosidic reaction; Km (t) is the ``Michaelis constant'' of the substrate when it binds as an acceptor. The term, K 0m º K s k 4 =k 2 ˛ k 4 ﬁﬁ is ignored for wild type enzyme [13] because Ks is small and because k4 is much smaller than k2. For the substituted enzymes described herein, Ks is
Cellobiose: 4-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucopyranose; cellotriose: 4-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucopyranose; cellotetraose: 4-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucopyranose; cellopentaose: 4-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-4-Ob-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-Dglucopyranose; gentiobiose: 6-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucopyranose. 3 Eq. (1) has terms with the [substrate] squared because the substrate is also a transglucosidic acceptor and it thus binds and affects the rates in two ways.

large and thus K 0m can not be ignored. Since transglucosidic reactions predominate with the substituted enzymes, the rate equation for the substituted enzymes was derived by assuming that only transglucosidic reactions occur (k3 of Fig. 1 was assumed to be zero). This derivation gives a Michaelis≠Menten equation: v0 º K 0cat ΩSΩEt K 0m ˛ ΩS 2ﬁ

For this equation, k 0cat º k 2 k 4 =k 2 ˛ k 4 ﬁ and 0 K m º K s k 4 =k 2 ˛ k 4 ﬁ. The k3 value is not actually zero because some hydrolysis does occur with the substituted enzymes when [S] is small. Thus, Eq. (2) only holds when [S] is not small.4 The values of kcat (h), Km (h), kcat (t), and Km (t) for wild type were estimated by non-linear regression using Eq. (1) (the value of K 0m is negligible for wild type enzyme). The substituted enzymes follow normal Michaelis≠Menten kinetics and hence the k 0cat and K 0m values were determined by non-linear regression with Eq. (2). If possible, substrate concentrations were chosen so that about half were below the K 0m and about half above. This was difficult for some of the substituted enzymes because the K 0m values were very high. In those cases, concentrations as high as possible were used. Reactions that were to be analyzed by TLC were carried out in glass tubes containing 150 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 4.5 (25 ∞C). The transglucosidic activity was qualitatively estimated [13] by TLC analyses of the amounts of Glc and of adducts that formed (Fig. 1). Substrates and enzyme were mixed at zero time and 1 lL aliquots were applied to TLC plates at timed intervals. Control studies in which the TLC plates were eluted immediately after spotting and at time intervals after spotting showed that the reaction stopped immediately upon application to the TLC plates. The identities of the sugars were determined with standards. TLC plates (K6F Silica Gel 60A) were eluted with a mixture of n-butanol, ethylacetate, 2-propanol, acetic acid, and water in the ratio (1:3:2:1:1). Sugars and compounds that contained sugar components (e.g., pNPGlc) were detected by dipping the dried plates into a solution of 2% sulfuric acid in methanol (v/v) and then charring at 450 ∞C. GLC analyses of reactions with cellobiose were carried out. Cellobiose is the substrate but at higher concentrations, after the reducing Glc has been released and the non-reducing Glc is still bound to the enzyme, the substrate can bind as an acceptor and form trisaccharide adducts by reacting with the bound Glc (Fig. 1). Previous studies [13] showed that a specific trisaccharide (b-D-glucopyranosyl-(1≠6)-b-D-glucopyranosyl-(1≠4)-D-glucopyranose) and
Excluding the small v0 values at low [S] from the analyses actually makes little difference to the k 0cat and K 0m values that one obtains by nonlinear regression of Eq. (2) because the v0 values at low [S] are very small numbers and are only different by tiny amounts from the values that would be obtained if there was no hydrolysis.

gentiobiose form when wild type family 3 b-glucosidase from A. niger is incubated with cellobiose. The trisaccharides can also bind and react as acceptors to form tetrasaccharide adducts which, in turn, can also act as acceptors. The gentiobiose forms when the amount of free Glc has built up to levels that allow it to bind as an acceptor and react. The transglucosidic reactions were, therefore, quantitated by measuring the amounts of trisaccharide and gentiobiose. Aliquots (100 lL) were transferred to tubes immersed in liquid N2 to stop the reaction at timed intervals after the enzyme was added. An internal standard (100 lL of 2 mM inositol) was also added to each tube and the contents were lyophilized to remove water, which interferes with the silylation reaction. The lyophilized samples were silylated by adding 500 lL of dimethylformamide (solvent) followed by 250 lL of hexamethyldisilazane and 100 lL of trimethylchlorosilane. After vortexing, the tubes were incubated for 30 min at 70 ∞C, vortexed again and the incubation was repeated. After the two incubations, the mixture had separated into two liquid layers. The silylated sugars were concentrated in the thin upper layer. A small sample ($1 lL) of this upper layer was injected into a 5710 A Hewlett Packard Gas Chromatograph (flame ionization) with an OV-101 (3%) packed stainless steel column (0.6 cm ID ∑ 200 cm) prepared by Chromatographic Specialties. Gas pressures used were: helium (50 psi), compressed air (60 psi), and hydrogen (40 psi). Injector and detector temperatures were 350 and 300 ∞C, respectively. The temperature program was: 200 ∞C for 4 min, increased at 8 ∞C/min to 310 ∞C, and maintained at 310 ∞C for 32 min. The areas under the product peaks were measured and the ratios of the product peak areas to the internal standard peak areas were determined. The ratios were compared to standard curves of Glc, gentiobiose and trisaccharide for quantitation. Results Purification SDS≠PAGE showed that the substituted enzymes were >97% pure (not shown) and that the sizes of the subunits were the same as those of wild type b-glucosidase. Size exclusion chromatography used in the purification and native PAGE showed that these enzymes were in the dimeric form (like wild type). The fluorescence spectra were essentially identical to those of wild type enzyme indicating that the substitutions did not cause gross changes in protein structure. W262P-b-Glucosidase was so inactive that its activity was hard to detect and, therefore, studies of its properties were not pursued. Kinetics The kinetic plots for the enzymes with substitutions for Trp-262 were different from those for the wild type enzyme (results with pNPGlc are shown in Fig. 2 but similar results

were found for cellobiose, gentiobiose and oNPGlc). The plots for wild type enzyme (Fig. 2--Y-axis on left) are unusual and have been described in detail previously [13] (the line was fit to the data using Eq. (1), which was derived from the mechanism). In brief, the rates with wild type bglucosidase increase at low substrate concentrations (up to about 2 mM) in a normal hyperbolic manner because the predominating reaction at low substrate concentration is hydrolytic. The rates then decrease--resulting in an adjoining downward hyperbolic curve when the substrate concentration becomes high enough so that it binds as an acceptor and reacts with the bound Glc to form a transglucosidic adduct. The adjoining downward hyperbolic curve is a result of the substrate binding as an acceptor with a transglucosidic reaction that has a kcat (t) that is smaller than the kcat (h) of the hydrolytic reaction [13]. The plots of the enzymes with substitutions for Trp-262 (Y-axis on right) followed normal Michaelis≠Menten kinetics (Eq. (2)). The k 0cat values of all of the substituted enzymes were smaller than the kcat (h) values of the wild type enzyme (Table 1). The K 0m values (Table 1) of the substituted enzymes were higher (especially for pNPGlc, oNPGlc, cellobiose and gentiobiose) than the Km (h) values with wild type enzyme. The K 0m values of the substituted enzymes were smaller with the longer substrates (Table 1), although still larger than for wild type. Table 2 shows that the competitive inhibition of the substituted enzymes by Glc was very poor (the Ki values were 132- to 162-fold higher than for wild type b-glucosidase). The Ki values of cellobiose and gentiobiose were 26- to 80-fold higher while the Ki values for cellotriose were

only 5- to 17-fold higher than for wild type b-glucosidase. (Cellobiose, gentiobiose, and cellotriose are substrates but their inhibitory activity can be measured using pNPGlc as the substrate as long as the assay is completed before a significant amount of the inhibitor has reacted.) TLC studies The amount of transglucosidation could be conveniently estimated by TLC by qualitatively estimating the amount of oligosaccharides that are formed when cellobiose and pNPGlc are the acceptors as well as the substrates. The analyses of wild type and of W262F b-glucosidase with 95 mM cellobiose are shown (Fig. 3). The results with the other substituted enzymes were very similar to those for W262F-b-glucosidase. For wild type (Fig. 3A), glucose and trisaccharide (previously identified as b-D-glucopyranosyl-(1≠6)-b-D-glucopyranosyl-(1≠4)-D-glucopyranose [13]--shown by thick solid arrows in Fig. 3) were formed early in the reaction. The amount of trisaccharide present reached a maximum at about 20≠60 min and the amount then decreased. No higher oligo-saccharides formed even when the concentration of the trisaccharide was at its zenith. Gentiobiose (shown by the dashed arrow in Fig. 3A) also formed when the concentration of glucose had built up to high enough levels for it to act as an acceptor. The reaction with W262F-b-glucosidase was slower and only a portion of the reaction is shown (Fig. 3B). The trisaccharide (solid arrow) could be seen within the first 10 min and Glc was visible at about 30 min. Glc is not detectable as ear-

ly as the trisaccharides because the sensitivity by charring is three times smaller for Glc. If gentiobiose was a product, its concentration was so low that it could not be detected by TLC. The amount of trisaccharide remained high and significant amounts of tetrasaccharide and some pentasaccharide (see thin arrows--Fig. 3B) were also formed after the trisaccharide and tetrasaccharide concentrations had built up to such high values that they became acceptors. TLC was also carried out for all of the substituted b-glucosidases with 5 mM cellobiose (not shown). Even at this low concentration of cellobiose, roughly equal amounts of trisaccharide and glucose were formed. Indeed, an experiment (not shown) was done at 2 mM cellobiose and even then, 40% of the product at early times (before a significant amount of the cellobiose that could act as an acceptor was used up) was the trisaccharide. TLC was also done with 50 mM pNPGlc. If only transglucosidic reactions are occurring, only pNP should be produced. Glc should be absent. The TLC plates for wild type and for W262F b-glucosidase (representative of the substituted enzymes) are shown (Fig. 4). Glc was produced by wild type (Fig. 4A) but no Glc was found after incubation with W262F b-glucosidase (Fig. 4B). The only products detected on the plates of the substituted enzymes were pNPGentiobiose (p-nitrophenyl-b-Dglucopyranosyl-b-D-(1≠6)-glucopyranose--also produced by wild type [13]) and an additional band (probably pNPGentiobiose with another Glc attached). pNP was also produced but since it does not char it is not visible on the TLC plates.

Fig. 3. Thin layer chromatography of: (A) the wild type b-glucosidase reaction; and (B) the W262F-b-glucosidase reaction (with 95 mM cellobiose in each case). Enzyme (8 lg/mL) was added to the reaction mixture at zero time and an aliquot (1 lL) was immediately spotted onto the plates. Spotting was repeated at the times indicated (min) on the bottom of the plate. The chromatography solvent used was n-butanol, ethyl acetate, 2-propanol, acetic acid, water (1:3:2:1:1). The plates were developed twice (they were dried between developing). Products were detected by dipping the dried plates in 2% sulphuric acid in methanol and charring (450 ∞C). The standards used (1 lL) in (A) were: 2 mM cellobiose (C), 2 mM glucose (G), 2 mM gentiobiose (Ge) and 1 mM b-D-glucopyranosyl-(1≠6)-b-D-glucopyranosyl-(1≠4)-D-glucopyranose (T, trisaccharide). The standards used in (B) were: 10 mM cellobiose (C), 10 mM gentiobiose (Ge), 10 mM glucose (G), and 10 mM b-D-glucopyranosyl-(1≠6)-b-D-glucopyranosyl-(1≠4)-D-glucopyranose (T, trisaccharide). Dashed arrow, gentiobiose; thick arrow, trisaccharide; thin arrows, tetra- and penta-saccharides. There is not a dashed arrow for Fig. 3B because there is no gentiobiose present.

GLC studies The GLC results for timed reactions with cellobiose are only shown (Fig. 5) for wild type and W262F b-glucosidase but, again, the data with the other substituted enzymes were similar. A different concentration of wild type b-glucosidase than of W262F-b-glucosidase was used because the rates with the two enzymes are different. In the case of the wild type enzyme with 5 mM cellobiose (Fig. 5A) mainly glucose was formed. Only a very small amount of trisaccharide could be detected and that was only seen early in the reaction. For W262F-b-glucosidase with 5 mM cellobiose (Fig. 5B) essentially as much trisaccharide as glucose was formed at early times. With time the trisaccharide concentration decreased relative to the Glc concentration. At 50 mM cellobiose, with wild type b-glucosidase (Fig. 5C) the amounts of Glc and trisaccharide produced were equal very early in the reaction but the amount of trisaccharide present then decreased rapidly relative to the rate of Glc production and the concentration of trisaccharide became low as it was hydrolyzed. Gentiobiose was also formed by wild type (after a delay--when Glc had built up to a high enough level so that it could act as an acceptor). With W262F-b-glucosidase, the amount of trisaccharide produced was equal to the amount of Glc produced for a sig-

nificant time period (Fig. 5D). The amount of trisaccharide present relative to Glc decreased later. The TLC results (see Fig. 3B) showed, however, that this was not because the trisaccharide was being hydrolyzed, but because the trisaccharide was being used as an acceptor to form larger oligosaccharides. (Larger oligosaccharides can not be detected by GLC because the high temperatures required for their elution from GLC columns would destroy the column.) Only a small amount of gentiobiose was formed by the substituted enzymes (Figs. 5B and D). Discussion Trp-262 of the A. niger family 3 b-glucosidase is strictly conserved in all known sequences of family 3 glycosyl hydrolases. In addition, Asp-261, which is adjacent, is the catalytic nucleophile [11]. The results reported here show that Trp-262 is a key residue for the hydrolytic and transglucosidic reaction components of the A. niger family 3 bglucosidase. For interpretation of the data, it is important to understand that the reducing Glc of cellobiose and pNP of pNPGlc have to be released before acceptor can bind and react. When cellobiose is the substrate, HOR (see Fig. 1) is the reducing Glc, while with pNPGlc, HOR is pNP.

Fig. 4. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of the b-glucosidase reaction with 50 mM pNPGlc at 25 ∞C. (A) Wild type b-glucosidase; (B) W262F-bglucosidase. Enzyme was added to the reaction mixture at zero time and an aliquot was immediately spotted onto the plate. Spotting was repeated at the times indicated in minutes on the bottom of the plates. The chromatography solvent used was n-butanol, ethyl acetate, 2-propanol, acetic acid, water (1:3:2:1:1). The plates were developed twice and were dried between developments. After elution, the plates were dipped in 2% sulphuric acid in methanol (v/v) and charred. The standards used were: 10 mM pNPGlc (P), 10 mM glucose (G), 10 mM cellobiose (C), and 10 mM gentiobiose (Ge). (Note. pNPGe, pNPGentiobiose.)

Thus, if the reaction with cellobiose is totally transglucosidic, the ratio of Glc to transglucosidic adduct produced should be 1.0, while if the reaction with pNPGlc is totally transglucosidic, no Glc should be released. The non-reducing Glc of cellobiose and the Glc of pNPGlc are not released as free Glc because they are transferred. TLC showed qualitatively that when cellobiose was both a substrate and an acceptor of the b-glucosidases with substitutions for Trp-262, approximately equal amounts of trisaccharide and higher transglucosidic oligosaccharides (Fig. 3B) are formed by the substituted enzymes (note that because Glc is 3∑ smaller than the trisaccharide, its sensitivity when charred for visualization is 3∑ less; it is 4∑ less for tetrasaccharide; etc.). When pNPGlc was the substrate and acceptor, TLC showed that no Glc was formed by the substituted enzymes (Fig. 4B). As stated in the previous paragraph, if mainly transglucosidic reactions occur, equal amounts of Glc and of transglucosidic adducts should be produced when cellobiose is the substrate (and acceptor) and Glc should not be formed when pNPGlc is the substrate (and acceptor). These data thus indicate that substitutions for Trp-262 cause the reactions to be primarily transglucosidic. The GLC results quantitatively confirmed that substitutions for Trp-262 caused the transglucosidic reaction to predominate. At 50 mM cellobiose with W262F-b-glucosidase (and the other substituted enzymes), the amount of trisaccharide formed was equal to the amount of Glc formed (Fig. 5D) for a significant portion of the incubation. There was a small decrease in the amount of trisaccharide present

(relative to Glc) with the substituted enzymes at later times but TLC (Fig. 3B) showed that this decrease was not because the trisaccharide was being hydrolyzed but because the trisaccharide became the acceptor and higher oligosaccharide adducts formed. For wild type enzyme with 50 mM cellobiose (Fig. 5C), the decrease of the trisaccharide concentration (which was much more pronounced) occurred because the trisaccharides were being hydrolyzed. Even at 5 mM cellobiose, the amount of trisaccharide produced by the substituted enzymes was identical to the Glc produced (Fig. 5B) for a significant period while for wild type enzyme (Fig. 5A), essentially no trisaccharide formed. Both the TLC and GLC results showed that only a little gentiobiose was formed by the substituted enzymes compared to wild type enzyme. Gentiobiose forms when the amount of Glc formed is high enough so that it can bind to an acceptor site and react. Less Glc is formed by the substituted enzymes because of less hydrolysis. In addition, the cellobiose present and the increased amounts of adducts that are formed by the substituted enzymes would out-compete Glc as acceptors because they bind to more than one site while Glc, of course, binds to only one productive site. The large Km values found with pNPGlc, oNPGlc, cellobiose, and gentiobiose for the enzymes with substitutions for Trp-262 (Table 1) indicate that the Ks values (substrate dissociation equilibrium constants) are much larger than for wild type b-glucosidase. The Km values of the substituted enzymes are essentially equal to K 0m (Eqs. (1) and (2)). K 0m

is equal to Ks (k4/(k2 + k4). Thus, K s º K 0m k 2 ˛ k 4 ﬁ=k 4 ﬁ is always as large or larger than K 0m and the affinity of pNPGlc, oNPGlc, cellobiose, and gentiobiose as substrates of the substituted enzymes is very poor. The K 0m values of the longer cello-oligosaccharides (cellotriose, cellotetraose, and cellopentaose) with the substituted enzymes were significantly smaller showing that Trp-262 is important for the interaction with small substrates while for longer substrates, interaction with other amino acids along the binding cleft somewhat compensates for the lack of Trp-262. This implies that the effect of substituting for Trp-262 on binding with this exoglucosidase is manifested at the non-reducing end of the substrate. Analyses of the Ki values (Table 2) supports the proposal that substitution for Trp-262 causes poor binding of the non-reducing Glc. Ki values are dissociation constants of the complex between the inhibitor and the free enzyme. Glc binds very poorly to the substituted enzymes (as much as 162-fold poorer). The substrate used (pNPGlc) for Ki determination would occupy sites5
The substrates are labeled from the scissile glycosidic bond. The glycosidic bond to be cleaved is always located between the ¿1 and +1 sites [14]. The sites on the side of the scissile bond at which the nonreducing end binds are given negative numbers of progressively increasing magnitude. The site closest to the scissile bond is ¿1. The sites on the side of the scissile bond to which the reducing end binds are given progressively larger positive numbers starting with +1.

¿1, and +1. Assuming that all of the sites are independent, competitive inhibition by Glc would only occur when Glc binds to either site ¿1 or +1 (or both). Thus, the very large Ki values with Glc show that the effect of the substitution is at site ¿1 or +1 (or both). The inhibition by cellobiose and gentiobiose was altered less by the substitutions than was the inhibition by Glc. These disaccharides would inhibit the binding of pNPGlc by binding to sites ¿1 and +1 or +1 and +2. The Ki values for cellotriose increased the least. Since the effects on binding (Ki) become smaller as the inhibitor length increases, this again suggests that substitutions for Trp-262 cause large decreases of binding at the ¿1 site but smaller decreases (if any) at sites +1 site and +2. The best evidence that the substitutions cause a decrease in binding mainly at site ¿1 is that quantitative GLC studies (Fig. 5B) showed that even at cellobiose concentrations as low as 5 mM, transglucosidic reactions dominate. To be an acceptor, cellobiose must bind to sites +1 and +2. Since transglucosidic activity is good at low cellobiose concentrations, binding of acceptor at sites +1 and +2 must be good. Indeed, TLC results (not shown) indicated that even at 2 mM cellobiose about 40% of the reaction with the substituted enzyme was transglucosidic. This good transglucosidic reactivity at a low acceptor concentration shows that binding at sites +1 and +2 is good. In conjunction with the Ks and Ki data, these results mean that substituting

74

for Trp-262 significantly decreases binding at site ¿1 but has little or no effect at other sites. The results also suggest that k3 (the hydrolysis rate constant--Fig. 1) becomes small upon substituting for Trp262. Values of kcat(h) (= k2k3/(k2 + k3)) were obtained by applying Eq. (1) to the kinetic data. It is difficult to obtain accurate estimates of each of the five unknowns of Eq. (1) by non-linear regression. However, the kcat(t) values are equal to the k 0cat values (Table 1) of cellobiose (analyses with pNPGlc led to similar conclusions) because kcat (t) and k 0cat are both equal to k2k4/(k2 + k4) and the K 0m values of the substituted enzymes are known (Table 1). Thus, only three unknowns had to be estimated. One of these unknowns was kcat (h) and estimates of about 3≠4 s¿1 were obtained for it (compared to 103 s¿1 for wild type). Evidence that these small values are correct was that the ratios of the hydrolytic to the transglucosidic products formed were almost identical to the ratios predicted using the small estimates of kcat (h). In contrast, if the kcat(h) values of the substituted enzymes would have been high, the ratios of hydrolytic to transglucosidic product predicted would have been very different. Small kcat (h) (= k2k3/(k2 + k3)) values indicate that k2 or k3 (or both) are small. Michaelis≠ Menten like kinetics such as those obtained are not expected if only k2 is small but such kinetics would be obtained if only k3 is small. Thus, the data are consistent with a small k3. A slightly mis-oriented transition state (that would bind near to Trp-262 at site ¿1) could be the cause of a small k3. The three dimensional structure of barley family 3 b-Dglucan-exo-hydrolase [15] shows that the substrate interacts with Trp-286. Trp-286 is at the same relative sequence position of that enzyme as Trp-262 is for the A. niger enzyme. If the A. niger enzyme structure is similar to the barley enzyme, one would expect that binding and reactivity would change upon substitution. It has been suggested [16] that Trp at active sites of glycosidases are mainly needed to maintain a hydrophobic environment at the ¿1 site. However, Phe and Leu have hydrophobic side-chains and yet, when these residues were substituted for Trp-262, the properties of the enzymes were not much different than they were for when Cys and Ala were substituted. The transglycosidic ability of some glycosidases [5≠8] has been utilized for the synthesis of oligosaccharides and adducts with a variety of biotechnological applications [17≠28]. Yields of about 65≠80% are common for synthetic enzymes called glycosynthetases (see recent reviews: [29≠33]) that are derived from glycosidases and use activated donors. However, attempts to use the transglycosidic activity of unaltered glycosidases for synthesis have resulted in low yields (20≠40%) because of competition from hydrolysis [34,35]. Recently, Hansson and Aldercreutz [5] were able to engineer a b-glucosidase from Pyrococcus furiosus with 45% efficiency. Attempts to increase the yield by doing the reactions in organic solvents [7] or in biphasic systems [8] also resulted in enhanced generation of transglycosidic products. It would, however, be much more con-

venient if highly efficient transglycosidic reactions could be carried out in water. Use of A. niger b-glucosidases with substitutions for Trp-262 have such potential. In conclusion, Trp-262, the residue next to the nucleophile in the A. niger family 3 b-glucosidase, is very important for the hydrolytic and transglucosidic reactions. The non-reducing Glc of the substrate binds poorly if Trp-262 is substituted by another residue and high substrate concentrations are needed for glucosidic bond breakage. When the aglycone is released from site +1 upon cleavage of the glucosidic bond, sites +1 and +2, which have strong binding ability, become saturated with acceptor (substrate in this study) and out-compete water. The data also indicate that the rate constant for the hydrolytic reaction (k3) is smaller for the substituted enzymes. To our knowledge, this is the first time that substitution for a Trp in a glycosidase has resulted in an enzyme with activity that is mainly transglycosidic. References
