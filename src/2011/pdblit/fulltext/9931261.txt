(reviewed in [6]). Both yeast RAS and mammalian H-Ras proteins activated 5'. cerevisiae adenylyl cyclase directly but, surprisingly, failed to activate adenylyl cyclase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Dictyostelium or Drosophila. This was one early clue that Ras proteins might activate various effecters in different organisms, a suspicion later confirmed by genetic studies in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans as well as biochemical studies in mammalian cells (reviewed in [7,8]). In addition to evidence that Ras regulated different effector pathways in different organisms, a number of studies indicated that Ras regulated multiple signaling pathways within the same organism. Although a number of other effector candidates have since been identified (reviewed in [9,10]), the direct effect of Ras is not understood in most cases. Furthermore, although some of the biochemical activities of these putative effecters are generally known, little is known about the role these molecules play in mediating Ras functions. Here, we review recent evidence that Ras proteins regulate multiple signal transduction pathways in mammalian cells, two of which may involve the direct activation of PI3-kinase and RalGDS, the exchange factor which activates the Ras-related protein Ral.

Raf-independent

Ras function

Introduction
Ras proteins are 21 kDa GTPases that function as molecular switches, cycling between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state. This process is regulated tightly by the activities of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) which accelerate GTP loading and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPS) which dramatically increase the rate of GTP hydrolysis. These regulatory proteins, in turn, are controlled through the activation of cell surface receptors, a process that is conserved in eukaryote evolution. Ras proteins are essential signaling components that regulate a host of biological responses including proliferation and differentiation of mammalian cells, eye development in flies, vulva development in nematodes and mating and growth in yeast. Ras proteins mediate their actions through the binding of effector proteins, which depends upon Ras proteins being in their GTP-bound state and involves interactions with the effector loop (amino acids 32110), some flanking residues, and the switch II region (amino acids 60-72) [l--S]. The first discovered Ras effector was adenylyl cyclase in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae

The most thoroughly studied Ras-dependent pathway in mammalian cells involves the activation of the MAPK cascade by ligands of receptor protein tyrosine kinases. Ras proteins are associated with the plasma membrane and are possibly localized with specific receptors in caveolae microdomains [11,12]. In unstimulated cells, these Ras proteins are in their inactive GDP-bound state. Upon receptor-activation by ligand, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, SOS, is recruited to the plasma membrane where it catalyzes the exchange of GTP for GDP on Ras. GTP-bound Ras binds cytoplasmic Raf-I through the conserved region CRl, and possibly other regions of the Raf-1 protein, and translocates it to the plasma membrane where Raf-1 kinase becomes activated by a mechanism which is still understood poorly. Activated Raf-1 is the first member of a kinase cascade that results in the activation of ERKl and/or ERKZ which, in turn, phosphorylate and activate transcriptional factors that induce transcription of genes required for entry into S phase of the cell cyc!e (reviewed in [9-131). In addition, GTP-Ras binds and may directly activate B-Raf [ 14'1. Early indications of Ras regulating additional signal transduction pathways came from studies using cell types which were induced to differentiate, rather than divide, in a Ras-dependent manner. Nerve growth factor or oncogenic Ras are not mitogenic but induce expression of a number of genes and the formation of dendrites in PC12 cells. Activated Raf-1 induces the expression of a subset

76

of these genes, suggesting that Raf-1 is a branchpoint and that Ras regulates at least one additional pathway in these cells [15]. Similar observations were made using cardiac myocytes in which oncogenic Ras induced both genetic and morphological changes. Activated Raf-1 induced ERK activity and new gene transcription but not the cytoskeletal reorganization associated with Ras function

shared among several proteins which localize to specific cell-cell interaction sites. AF-6 is also found as the fusion partner in a number of translocations found commonly in acute lymphoblastic and myelocytic leukemias [27]. Rinl was found originally in a screen for proteins

[ 161. Ras also induces membrane ruffling in fibroblasts [ 171 and it was shown subsequently that ruffling was regulated by the related small GTPase Racl [18]; it appears now that activation of Raf and ERK are not needed for Ras to induce ruffling [19']. These observations made it
apparent that Ras could regulate both Raf-dependent and Raf-independent signals. Studies using Ras-transformed fibroblasts indicate that Ras may regulate both Raf-dependent mitogenic signals and Raf-independent mitogenic signals via Rat and Rho (reviewed in [ZO]). It appears that these may be parallel signaling pathways and that the Rat-dependent mitogenic component is distinct from the component regulating cytoskeletal reorganization.

encoded by human cDNA that interfered with Ras signal transduction in yeast [28']. Rinl was also shown to bind GTP-Ras preferentially at the effector region and compete with Raf for Ras binding. By using a related strategy, several groups screened for mutations that suppressed abnormal vulva1 and eye development caused by constitutively activated Ras in C. elegans and Drosophila respectively [29-311. The screens revealed homologs of a novel gene named KSR-I (Rinase suppressor of r-as-l). KSR-1 appears to be a novel member of the protein kinase superfamily with sequence hallmarks found commonly in both serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases but it is most similar to the Raf family kinases with 30-40% sequence identity. Genetic studies indicate that KSR-I lies downstream of ras but it is not known whether KSR-2 functions upstream of rafor in a separate signaling pathway. In addition, protein interaction assays using the yeast two-hybrid system or bacterially expressed fusion proteins have not yet detected any interaction between Ras and KSR-1 [31]. Evidence that Ras can activate binding proteins directly has been provided recently in two cases: RalGDS and PI3-kinase. RalGDS is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Ras-like GTPases RalA and RalB [32]. RalGDS interacts with Ras through the effector loop in a GTP-dependent manner in vitro in insect cells and in the yeast two-hybrid system (33-351, making it a candidate for a biological effector of Ras action. Association of Ras and RalGDS could also be stimulated in mammalian cells by epidermal growth factor [36]. It was discovered recently [37] that Ras can stimulate exchange activity of RalGDS in cells. Cotransfection of Ras in COS cells expressing RalGDS and RalA led to increased levels of GTP-RalA [37]. This increase was not seen if a catalytically active RalGDS mutant which cannot bind Ras was used. The specificity of RalGDS activation by Ras is indicated by the finding that both R-ras and Rap lA--which bind RalGDS in vitro and in cells-failed to increase RaslGDS activity. RalGDS may mediate its effects via Ral, although this issue is still controversial. One group [38] has reported no cooperativity between Raf-1 and Ral; but another group found that expression of an activated Ral mutant. L72 Ral, svnergized with suboptimal amounts of either V12 Ras or v-Raf to transform NIH3T3 cells and that a dominant negative Ral blocked transformation (371. Expression of activated RalA alone failed to activate ERK2 and did not enhance ERKZ activity when co-expressed if confirmed, indicate that with Ras. These findings, activation of Ral via RalGDS constitutes a Ras-dependent signal transduction pathway which is distinct from. and cooperates with, the hIAPE; pathway.

Ras effectors
Proteins other than Raf have been shown to interact with Ras in a GTP-dependent manner. Neurofibromin and plZOGAP were the first proteins shown to bind GTP-Ras at the effector loop, stimulating hydrolysis of GTP and inactivating Ras by shifting it to the GDP-bound state. pl20GAP has multiple domains including SHZ, SH3, a pleckstrin homology domain, CalB domain, and hydrophobic domain. It interacts with other proteins including receptor protein tyrosine kinases and ~190, itself a GAP for Rho and Rat. There is, thus, the possibility that Ras-mediated signals could be propagated via pl20GAP: presently, however, there is no clear evidence for the existence of such pathways [9,10,21]. hlEK kinase 1 (hlEKK1) and protein kinase Cc (PKCC) are two serinelthreonine kinases other than Raf that bind Ras. MEKKl is a mammalian homolog of Byr2, a Rasregulated protein kinase which is activated in response to mating pheromones in S. pomh. MEKKl functions upstream in a kinase pathway involving stress-activated protein kinases and can be stimulated in a Ras-dependent manner [22]. GTP-bound Ras binds hlEKK1 through its carboxy-terminal kinase domain [23]. PKC< is an atypical PKC isoform that is insensitive to diacylglycerol and calcium. Several studies suggest that PKCC can play a role in Ras-mediated signal transduction [24,25]. As with Raf-1, it has an amino-terminal regulatory domain which binds GTP-Ras and association with Ras can be stimulated im vivo by platelet derived growth factor. Whether or not hlEKK1 or PKCL are activated directly by Ras is not known. AF-6 and Canoe are two structurally related proteins found recently to bind GTP-Ras [26]: the function of these proteins is not known but they contain the GLGF motif

may thus also be Ras effecters. RGL (RalGDS-like) and Rlf (RaIGDS-like factor) were found using the yeast two-hybrid screen [34,39]. These proteins all share a conserved carboxy-terminal Ras-binding domain as well as an amino-terminal domain and the three conserved regions in the catalytic domain of Cd&?5 and mSos-1. Although no biochemical function has yet been demonstrated for these molecules, sequence homologies indicate that RGL and Rlf are putative guanine nucleotide exchange factors of the Cd&?5 family, the activity of which may also be regulated by Ras. PI3-kinase is a lipid kinase-activated by a number of growth factors and cytokines-that catalyzes the phosphorylation of the inositol 3' hydroxyl group of phosphatidyl inositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PI[4,5]P2) to yield phosphatidyl inositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PI[3,4,5]P$. An isoform of PI3-kinasethe activity of which is regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases-is composed of a p85a regulatory chain and a pllOa catalytic chain [40]. Ras has been shown to bind directly to the ~110~ catalytic subunit of PI3-kinase [41]. This interaction required GTP and was not observed using the A35 Ras effector loop mutant. In cells, expression of the dominant negative mutant N17 Ras inhibited epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor induced increases in 3' phosphorylated phosphoinositides. In addition, the levels of PI(3,4,5)Pj in COS cells were greatly increased by co-expression of Ras and PI3-kinase. These findings were extended recently by showing that Ras failed to bind a K227E ~110~~ mutant protein in vitro [42]. Similar levels of P1(3,4,5)P~ were seen in COS cells expressing p85a with either wild-type or mutant pllOa, suggesting that the point mutation did not impair catalytic activity. Use of the mutant pl10a in COS cell transfections, however, abolished the activating effect of co-expressing Ras. It was also shown in an in vitro reconstitution system that GTP-Ras can increase the lipid kinase activity of PI3-kinase directly. These data provide strong evidence that PI3-kinase activity can be regulated directly by Ras in cells. PI3-kinase may provide a link between Ras and the Rho GTPases and appears to function upstream of Rat, possibly by generating 3' phosphorylated phosphoinositides that activate Rat guanine nucleotide exchange factors [43].

activity in cells. By contrast, VlZS35 Ras bound Raf-1 in vitro and stimulated activation of Raf-1, ERK, and Elk-l [45]. In addition, VlZG37 Ras cooperated with an activated Raf-1 mutant to transform cells. These results show clearly that Ras regulates at least one other pathway in addition to the Raf/hlAPK cascade. In fact, VlZG37 Ras can cooperate with VlZC40 Ras in transformation assays. Neither Ras mutant binds or activates Raf-1, indicating that Ras activates at least two Raf-independent signaling pathways [45]. Significantly, from similar studies, RalGDS appears to be one landmark for an alternate Ras pathway. RalGDS was isolated from a screen of VlZG37 Ras-binding proteins [38]. Just as was seen using VlZG37 Ras and mutant Raf-1 in cotransfection studies, RalGDS could synergize with mutant Raf-1 to transform NIH3T3 cells. As discussed above, it remains to be seen whether transformation requires Ral activity or another target of RalGDS. Ras mutants also dissociate stimulation of morphological ity associated with activation ERK activation from the changes and JNKl activof Rho family GTPases

[19,45]. VlZG37 Ras and VlZC40 Ras-another mutant defective in Raf bindinginduced membrane ruffling and stimulated JNKl activity. By contrast, VlZS35 Ras activated ERK and JNKl but was defective in stimulating membrane ruffling. Both Ras mutants were defective in stimulating DNA synthesis but could cooperate when coexpressed. It would be informative to determine if VlZG37 Ras or VlZC40 Ras could bind and activate PI3-kinase whereas VlZS35 Ras could not.

Conclusions
Results showing that mutant Ras proteins bind potential effecters and mediate various cellular activities, as well as studies using activated mutants of Raf-1 and Ras-related GTPases, have provided critical information for our undersranding of Ras function. These studies have provided overwhelming evidence that Ras regulates at least two distinct signal transduction pathways in mammalian cells: one involves the Raf-dependent activation of ERKl and ERKZ, resulting in transcription of genes for growth and differentiation: the other pathway is Raf-independent and involves activation of Rho family GTPases which play a role in actin cytoskeletal reorganization. A similar pathway bifurcation has been identified in yeast [46]. RalGDS or PI3-kinase may be immediate downstream effecrors of one or more Raf-independent pathways (37,38,42,43]. The physiological relevance of Ras binding to other effector candidates remains to be determined. These studies provide further evidence that Ras can mediate its activity by two mechanisms: Ras may regulate the activity of some effecters by recruiting them to the plasma membrane where they are subsequently activated

Ras mutants to dissect pathways
The use of Ras molecules containing point mucations has been exploited to identify the specific amino acids which mediate Ras-effector interactions. hlore recently, Ras mutants have been used to correlate effector interaction with biological function, providing further evidence of branchpoints in Ras signaling. For example, the S35 H-Ras and G37 H-Ras, and the V12 double mutants interact with largely non-overlapping sets of proteins [44"]. Both V12S3.5 Ras and VlZG37 Ras were defective

they compete for binding to overlapping regions of Ras. The use of mutant Ras proteins has extended our understanding of how this can occur by providing evidence that these proteins may interact with unique sets of amino acids within the switch I and switch II regions of Rasthe very regions of Ras that differ in structure in the GDP-bound and the GTP-bound states. Residues flanking these regions may also be critical for the binding and function of specific effecters [4,5,47]. Although we now have more insight into the nature of specific Ras-effector interactions, the mechanisms that control the effector traffic around GTP-Ras are largely uncharacterized. Post-translational modification of effecters may differentially affect their affinity for Ras and thereby regulate Ras-mediated activation. Raf-1 and B-Raf can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA), resulting in the inhibition of Raf binding to Ras and activation (reviewed in [48]). By contrast, PKA phosphorylates RalGDS, which has no effect on either the exchange activity of RalGDS or its affinity for Ras [36]. In addition, PKA phosphorylation activates PKCC [49]. The activation of other small GTPases might also regulate Ras-mediated effector activation. GTP-bound RaplA, for example, binds Raf and RalGDS and an activated RaplA mutant can antagonize Ras function in cells, possibly by competing with Ras for effecters [SO]. In summary, Ras proteins bind to multiple proteins in a GTP-dependent manner at the effector-binding region. Of these interactions, only the binding of Ras to Raf has clear biological consequences; even here, the precise mechanism by which this interaction leads to Raf kinase activation needs to be clarified. In the next few years, we expect that genetic and biochemical approaches, together, will better define the other pathways that Ras controls. For example, the significance of Ras-dependent activation of PI3-kinase and RalGDS will be established and the pathways downstream from these effecters will be dissected. We are within sight of our goal to understand the roles that Ras proteins play in normal cell signaling and in malignant transformation.
